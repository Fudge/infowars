[00:00.000 --> 00:13.620]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.620 --> 00:22.860]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.860 --> 00:32.320]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome it is already the first day of the second
[00:32.320 --> 00:39.040]  month of 2010 February 1st 2010 we're gonna be live here for the next four
[00:39.040 --> 00:47.520]  hours joining us coming up briefly in the third hour Mark Moreno of climate
[00:47.520 --> 00:53.760]  depot will be joining us as we try to brace ourselves to stop the offshore
[00:53.760 --> 00:58.800]  corporations banks the United Nations taking over our local cities and
[00:58.800 --> 01:04.240]  counties with their international taxation neo feudalistic slave grid and
[01:04.240 --> 01:09.080]  that's what it is of course I covered Friday and Sunday cap and trade scam to
[01:09.080 --> 01:15.900]  be enforced at state level 2.6 billion dollars in taxes within the first three
[01:15.900 --> 01:26.960]  years in Austin alone 2.6 billion I mean the city budget isn't even a billion
[01:26.960 --> 01:33.720]  dollars a year the roads get 70 million but the bankers they get 2.6 billion
[01:33.720 --> 01:38.800]  they have criminally taken this nation over yes we won a big battle in the
[01:38.800 --> 01:46.920]  wider war against the parasites in Copenhagen now two months ago but the
[01:46.920 --> 01:51.400]  fight is far from over so that's coming up in the third hour today we're gonna
[01:51.400 --> 02:00.520]  have wide open phones throughout the entirety of the broadcast 1-800-259-9231
[02:00.520 --> 02:09.200]  1-800-259-9231 and obviously I have what is it one two three four five six seven
[02:09.200 --> 02:14.840]  eight nine ten stacks of fresh important news that I want to attempt to go over
[02:14.840 --> 02:24.360]  today some of the most important news I have here is the fact that there is a
[02:24.360 --> 02:31.760]  major major saber rattling by NATO the UN the United States England and others
[02:31.760 --> 02:38.200]  against China and Iran meanwhile the globalists that run our country have
[02:38.200 --> 02:42.720]  moved most of our industrial base from Europe England and the US and Canada to
[02:42.720 --> 02:48.280]  China and given them all the weapons system so what's really behind this
[02:48.280 --> 02:53.880]  extremely complex issue look at these types of headlines Bloomberg China
[02:53.880 --> 03:03.400]  Iran spur US to develop air sea battle plan the Guardian US raises stakes on
[03:03.400 --> 03:08.640]  Iran by sending in ships and missiles Pentagon says Patriot shield will deter
[03:08.640 --> 03:13.840]  strike on American allies in the Gulf yeah after Iran is hit we're gonna be
[03:13.840 --> 03:18.520]  breaking down the strategy I'm there the mail reports US deploys land and sea
[03:18.520 --> 03:25.000]  based missiles shield in the Gulf to deter attack from Iran that's the type of
[03:25.000 --> 03:31.960]  news Reuters US expanding missile defense in the Gulf so they can deter Iran's
[03:31.960 --> 03:36.680]  counter strike when Iran gets bombarded so we'll talk about Iran strategy the
[03:36.680 --> 03:42.640]  globalist strategy and a lot more also Ahmed denigide is running around saying
[03:42.640 --> 03:51.800]  quote Iran will deliver telling blow the global powers on February 11th no one
[03:51.800 --> 03:56.440]  knows exactly what that means I didn't know the date of the Islamic Revolution
[03:56.440 --> 04:04.560]  back in 79 was February 11th why does it have to be my birthday and Bert
[04:04.560 --> 04:08.800]  Reynolds for that matter and George Norris for that matter I think that is
[04:08.800 --> 04:12.720]  George's birthday he told me that I'm going for memory on that the point is is
[04:12.720 --> 04:18.480]  that we're gonna be breaking all of that down today have some interesting DNA
[04:18.480 --> 04:24.480]  news on the AIDS front also another story Egypt to unveil Tutankhamen's DNA
[04:24.480 --> 04:30.000]  results Jeb Bush is back and some think he's looking presidential visiting with
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.080]  Obama over the weekend also Brown is humbled by White House talk but doesn't
[04:34.080 --> 04:39.120]  rule out 2012 look I'm glad he took the Democrat seat to send a message on
[04:39.120 --> 04:43.080]  health care but the last person we need his president is Brown he helped
[04:43.080 --> 04:49.280]  author the bill the socialist bill in the Massachusetts Senate I mean this guy
[04:49.280 --> 04:54.720]  this guy makes John McCain look conservative all right look that is
[04:54.720 --> 04:57.920]  the tip of the iceberg we'll tell you about the UN's plan to shut down the
[04:57.920 --> 05:02.240]  web straight ahead this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[05:02.240 --> 05:06.520]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[05:06.520 --> 05:09.880]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[05:09.880 --> 05:13.800]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[05:13.800 --> 05:18.000]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[05:18.000 --> 05:22.480]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[05:22.480 --> 05:27.200]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[05:27.200 --> 05:31.000]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.600]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[05:34.600 --> 05:38.960]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[05:38.960 --> 05:42.120]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[05:42.120 --> 05:45.800]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[05:45.800 --> 05:51.320]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[05:51.320 --> 05:56.120]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[05:56.120 --> 06:05.160]  1-877-327-0365 hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century
[06:05.160 --> 06:09.920]  alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off
[06:09.920 --> 06:14.240]  this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home
[06:14.240 --> 06:19.280]  turning members influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[06:19.280 --> 06:23.920]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[06:23.920 --> 06:28.240]  citizens to pay attention fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[06:28.240 --> 06:33.520]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[06:33.520 --> 06:37.800]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[06:37.800 --> 06:41.320]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[06:41.320 --> 06:46.560]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[06:46.560 --> 06:52.240]  have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD
[06:52.240 --> 06:57.560]  at infowars.com we're watching online right now in super high quality at
[06:57.560 --> 07:03.480]  prisonplanet.tv hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are
[07:03.480 --> 07:07.600]  now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did
[07:07.600 --> 07:10.720]  you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[07:10.720 --> 07:14.640]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even golden silver
[07:14.640 --> 07:18.400]  before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our
[07:18.400 --> 07:22.360]  friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[07:22.360 --> 07:27.880]  seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of
[07:27.880 --> 07:31.640]  nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these
[07:31.640 --> 07:35.520]  seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough
[07:35.520 --> 07:40.960]  seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com
[07:40.960 --> 07:47.560]  that's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365
[07:47.560 --> 07:55.840]  that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the
[07:55.840 --> 08:01.640]  ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[08:04.360 --> 08:12.120]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[08:12.120 --> 08:19.680]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:19.680 --> 08:23.280]  Alex Jones
[08:29.200 --> 08:36.480]  the United States and England are clearly moving towards attacking Iran to
[08:36.480 --> 08:41.800]  do that they'll need to stage some terror attacks to whip the population into
[08:41.800 --> 08:47.640]  accepting the bombardment they're also claiming that Iran has WMD's weapons of
[08:47.640 --> 08:53.040]  mass destruction that they're on the verge of getting nukes and using them a
[08:53.040 --> 08:59.800]  replay of what we saw in 2002 2003 leading up to the attack on Iraq and
[08:59.800 --> 09:07.160]  here we are seven years later it'll be seven years in March so I'm gonna be
[09:07.160 --> 09:16.480]  breaking that news down today also we have a report here from the French news
[09:16.480 --> 09:23.720]  agency with the United Nations saying quote there is a pandemic it
[09:23.720 --> 09:27.640]  organizes the quarantine of cases we are not allowed to organize the
[09:27.640 --> 09:31.880]  systematic quarantine of machines that are compromised this was said at Davos
[09:31.880 --> 09:36.800]  if you want to drive a car you have to have a license to say that you're
[09:36.800 --> 09:41.360]  capable of driving a car the car has to pass a test to say if it is fit to drive
[09:41.360 --> 09:48.240]  and you have the insurance this was in a forum at Davos about UN control of the
[09:48.240 --> 09:56.240]  web Andre Kuleski chairman of Kuleski group said that a new internet might
[09:56.240 --> 10:01.040]  have to be created forcing people to have two computers that cannot connect and
[10:01.040 --> 10:06.160]  pass on a virus one internet for secure operations that's internet too and one
[10:06.160 --> 10:09.560]  internet for freedom the one they're systematically taking over and censoring
[10:09.560 --> 10:14.000]  and shutting down and major countries like Australia and Italy openly announcing
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.520]  quote Chinese style net censorship having to get a special license to even get
[10:18.520 --> 10:23.440]  online and Microsoft's new operating systems in the last four years have it
[10:23.440 --> 10:30.720]  built in to be accessed via a biometric thumbprint tied to your internet ID and
[10:30.720 --> 10:36.960]  Paul Watson is developing a big report set to be released today at prison
[10:36.960 --> 10:41.280]  planet dot com on this subject four years ago or was it five years ago we
[10:41.280 --> 10:46.400]  called this with precision with an article about internet to Trojan horse to
[10:46.400 --> 10:51.480]  take over the internet in fact we now actually have Paul Watson's article it
[10:51.480 --> 10:55.520]  just went up minutes ago enemies of free speech call for internet licensing
[10:55.520 --> 11:01.600]  death of the web moves closer as UN calls for policing cyberspace that's the
[11:01.600 --> 11:05.880]  French news agency headline is similar that's the prison planet headline here's
[11:05.880 --> 11:12.040]  the French news agency headline UN agency calls for global cyber warfare
[11:12.040 --> 11:18.680]  treaty drivers license for web users so I'm gonna be covering that coming up in
[11:18.680 --> 11:26.480]  the next hour also Iraq to sue us Britain over depleted uranium bombs and I
[11:26.480 --> 11:31.720]  want to get dr. Doug Rocky on this week on this subject du was used all over
[11:31.720 --> 11:37.240]  Iraq all over Serbia all over Afghanistan first the deformities
[11:37.240 --> 11:42.280]  doubled and tripled the latest numbers have quadrupled in every major city and
[11:42.280 --> 11:52.920]  in small towns where du is used it absolutely annihilates DNA it is the
[11:52.920 --> 11:59.840]  byproduct of the spent fuel rods from nuclear reactors so that is coming up as
[11:59.840 --> 12:07.840]  well and separately Obama has announced 54 billion dollars in government
[12:07.840 --> 12:12.680]  sponsored nuclear reactors in the United States and let's get this straight I am
[12:12.680 --> 12:19.000]  not against nuclear reactors though I think natural gas that the US has more
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.320]  than any other nation on earth and is now the biggest producer last year past
[12:22.320 --> 12:27.520]  Russia is the biggest producer is the way we should be fueling our cars our
[12:27.520 --> 12:32.720]  homes you name it it is one of the cleanest forms of fuel out there it
[12:32.720 --> 12:37.960]  does produce some carbon dioxide which plants breathe on the earth according to
[12:37.960 --> 12:42.360]  the ice core samples in it is in a carbon dioxide starved level right now
[12:42.360 --> 12:49.880]  compared to millions of years ago it is a life-giving gas but oh no we've got to
[12:49.880 --> 12:53.520]  put a tax on it and we've got to move away from using it and we want to build
[12:53.520 --> 13:01.000]  nuclear reactors that radiated much of the Ukraine and Eastern Europe and I've
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.200]  seen the documentaries and statistics out of the thousands of square miles
[13:05.200 --> 13:11.680]  that were hit by the main plume of Chernobyl back in the 1980s they can't
[13:11.680 --> 13:16.280]  eat the crops the deformities are off the charts the cancers are off the
[13:16.280 --> 13:23.280]  charts we do not need 54 billion dollars of new nuclear reactors if private
[13:23.280 --> 13:28.360]  companies with the states want to build them and they do have some new
[13:28.360 --> 13:33.200]  technologies that are a lot safer and if they are properly shielded I don't have
[13:33.200 --> 13:37.760]  a problem with it but you certainly don't build these like France and others
[13:37.760 --> 13:44.080]  have done instead of fossil fuels give me a break fossil fuels are no threat
[13:44.080 --> 13:49.880]  compared to nuclear reactors there's two of the stinking things in Austin and I
[13:49.880 --> 13:53.880]  don't particularly like it and they keep it so quiet that every time I mention
[13:53.880 --> 14:00.240]  that I get emails saying I'm a conspiracy theorist they've got a little
[14:00.240 --> 14:05.480]  reactor at UT and then at the JJ Pickle Center off research in north Austin
[14:05.480 --> 14:14.960]  they've got a big experimental reactor and it's a big in I digress I you know
[14:14.960 --> 14:18.440]  what I don't want nuclear reactors in my town if you want to stick them out in
[14:18.440 --> 14:21.240]  the desert the middle of nowhere that's one thing and it's still very dangerous
[14:21.240 --> 14:25.760]  what are they doing building reactors everywhere all the fake
[14:25.760 --> 14:33.880]  environmentalists run around saying build reactors not natural gas which we
[14:33.880 --> 14:39.480]  have literally coming out of our ears we are drowning in it we are drowning in
[14:39.480 --> 14:44.000]  natural gas all right I'm now digressing and ranting
[14:44.000 --> 14:54.320]  depleted uranium nuclear reactors I mean just come on and of course the eugenics
[14:54.320 --> 14:58.640]  lobby for the last 50 years is lobbied against reactors because they don't want
[14:58.640 --> 15:02.960]  economic development in the West but now they're backing off of that saying look
[15:02.960 --> 15:07.960]  just give us taxes on fossil fuels and we'll we'll throw a bone to the nuke
[15:07.960 --> 15:12.360]  companies and build these build these reactors all over the place so you're
[15:12.360 --> 15:18.640]  welcome to call in about that as well also I got some into this yesterday but
[15:18.640 --> 15:22.440]  now that we have more time I want to read through Kurt Haskell's article that
[15:22.440 --> 15:27.000]  links through to several newspapers and publications in Michigan like Detroit
[15:27.000 --> 15:33.280]  News the sharp dressed man who aided the underwear bomber on the flight 253 was a
[15:33.280 --> 15:41.920]  US government agent so that is coming up later in the next hour as well and that's
[15:41.920 --> 15:44.920]  just the tip of the iceberg of what we're going to be covering I have several
[15:44.920 --> 15:51.440]  mainstream news reports here like the Toronto Sun one small needle a world of
[15:51.440 --> 15:58.480]  trouble Donna Heartland a young mother who is now partly paralyzed has been
[15:58.480 --> 16:03.440]  diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome Heartland seen in her hospital room with
[16:03.440 --> 16:07.920]  her husband Wayne blames the H1N1 flu shop we've got doctors admitting that's
[16:07.920 --> 16:11.800]  what it is they admit on the insert it can do it so I thought we would go over
[16:11.800 --> 16:16.760]  that as well also a New York Times article you saw what an earthquake can
[16:16.760 --> 16:23.160]  do in Pakistan you've seen what it can do in Los Angeles in San Francisco you've
[16:23.160 --> 16:29.000]  seen what it can do in Haiti you've seen what it can do with tsunamis well you
[16:29.000 --> 16:35.280]  have the super volcano that isn't even dormant that's what makes there be the
[16:35.280 --> 16:41.960]  geysers and the bubbling sulfur mud in Yellowstone the super caldera is
[16:41.960 --> 16:51.360]  hundreds of square miles around just the cone just the hole and it is getting
[16:51.360 --> 16:54.280]  more and more unstable and as you know they've even had earthquakes in
[16:54.280 --> 17:01.280]  Oklahoma now definitely the earth is rumbling the earth is on the move the
[17:01.280 --> 17:09.080]  mother nature is bubbling and burbling and burping and it has nothing
[17:09.080 --> 17:15.200]  contrary to what the United Nations and Danny Glover say with human beings we
[17:15.200 --> 17:23.000]  have huge tectonic plates but 20 miles thick on average some areas only a few
[17:23.000 --> 17:31.760]  miles thick floating around on liquid oceans of molten rock and metal hundreds
[17:31.760 --> 17:38.040]  of quakes are rattling Yellowstone New York Times in the last two weeks more
[17:38.040 --> 17:43.560]  than 100 mostly tiny earthquakes a day on average have rattled a remote area of
[17:43.560 --> 17:47.520]  Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming putting scientists who monitor the park
[17:47.520 --> 17:53.760]  strange and volatile geology on alert researchers say for now the earthquake
[17:53.760 --> 17:58.480]  cluster or swarm the second largest ever recorded just a few months ago that
[17:58.480 --> 18:05.040]  one of the other biggest in the park is more a cause of curiosity than alarm the
[18:05.040 --> 18:10.920]  quake zone about 10 miles northeast of old faithful geyser has shown little
[18:10.920 --> 18:15.760]  indication they say of building towards a larger event like a volcanic
[18:15.760 --> 18:20.720]  eruption of the type that last ravaged Yellowstone region tens of thousands of
[18:20.720 --> 18:26.680]  years ago scientists don't know when that really happened the area is far from
[18:26.680 --> 18:30.120]  any rotor community in the park is relatively empty and winter listen to
[18:30.120 --> 18:36.600]  this whitewash the entire park is at the middle of the caldera swarms of small
[18:36.600 --> 18:42.280]  quakes including a similar swarm last year are relatively common but at a time
[18:42.280 --> 18:45.880]  when the disastrous earthquake in Haiti on January 12th is refocused global
[18:45.880 --> 18:50.600]  attention on the Earth's immense store of tectonic energy I'm surprised they
[18:50.600 --> 18:54.440]  don't say it's man-made warming doing this scientists say that Yellowstone

[26:07.960 --> 26:14.960]  want to also comment on that debate is very interesting I'm sure that you have
[26:14.960 --> 26:20.600]  access to the audio of that in the first opportunity to speak you can hear
[26:20.600 --> 26:26.160]  Hemming and Hawing intentionally intermittently as she's speaking and I
[26:26.160 --> 26:30.120]  believe it's coming from one of the people on the panel there yeah it's
[26:30.120 --> 26:34.520]  Rick Perry and Kay Bailey Hutchison talk basically Hemming and Hawing over Debra
[26:34.520 --> 26:40.120]  Medina I've seen it too no no no when she first started to speak there was
[26:40.120 --> 26:45.520]  these noises just complimented it was one of them but uh and it seemed very
[26:45.520 --> 26:50.240]  disrespectful they're scared of they're scared of the American people they're
[26:50.240 --> 26:53.960]  scared of the grassroots they want to just credit her and in the minds of the
[26:53.960 --> 26:59.760]  people when they hear that kind of thing over behind her speaking it gives the
[26:59.760 --> 27:04.440]  impression in the mind you know this lady is not to be considered serious
[27:04.440 --> 27:10.200]  Lee absolutely Kevin I bet you're gonna be voting for Debra Medina well I
[27:10.200 --> 27:14.520]  certainly I'm supporting her and I want to say that that that I don't think it's
[27:14.520 --> 27:19.120]  any mistake her name is Debra and that she it comes across as so sincere and
[27:19.120 --> 27:24.240]  honest and also she's willing to come on your show she's putting herself at
[27:24.240 --> 27:28.000]  risk but she's coming as a new order it's not
[27:28.000 --> 27:32.520]  I understand I mean Debra Medina basically comes from my show she's been
[27:32.520 --> 27:37.240]  a listener a long time got involved in the in the Fed rallies she sees a Ron
[27:37.240 --> 27:41.160]  Paul supporter she's one of us she doesn't just come on the show she wants

[27:44.600 --> 27:50.080]  candidate let's talk to Justin in West Virginia Justin you're on the air yeah
[27:50.080 --> 27:57.480]  um I was hearing you say that the yard something where they were saying the
[27:57.480 --> 28:03.960]  give me a big favor turn your radio off okay go ahead Justin when the you said
[28:03.960 --> 28:07.320]  the earth they were saying the earthquake was caused by global warming I
[28:07.320 --> 28:12.000]  just wanted to know what Luke said that and what's your take on that cuz that's
[28:12.000 --> 28:19.200]  just that's crazy Justin I appreciate your call the United Nations was in
[28:19.200 --> 28:24.480]  several newspaper reports last week with several United Nations officials and we
[28:24.480 --> 28:29.200]  read their names on air I don't have it in front of me saying that this is what
[28:29.200 --> 28:34.000]  we can expect to see more of because of global warming and then Danny Glover I
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.760]  don't know what was it two weeks ago we played the audio clip here Danny Glover
[28:38.760 --> 28:44.360]  the actor who I don't think is a bad guy he I mean he means well he's always
[28:44.360 --> 28:48.040]  trying to help people in humanitarian ways and he's trying to help the folks
[28:48.040 --> 28:53.680]  in Haiti he just is an idiot he said that clearly global warming caused the
[28:53.680 --> 28:57.920]  earthquake in Haiti when no scientists no geologists no hydrologists no
[28:57.920 --> 29:02.480]  climatologists no volcanologists the people that study earthquakes the people
[29:02.480 --> 29:07.960]  that study the oceans the people that study volcanoes no one has ever said
[29:07.960 --> 29:14.200]  that the atmosphere can cause earthquakes I actually looked it up when
[29:14.200 --> 29:18.840]  Danny Glover said it and they believe that an earthquake is already going to
[29:18.840 --> 29:24.600]  occur that the oceans sometimes dealing with tidal issues with the moon that
[29:24.600 --> 29:30.240]  that water can kind of pile up in certain regions and might contribute in
[29:30.240 --> 29:37.160]  small ways but to say that global warming caused the earthquake in in in
[29:37.160 --> 29:42.880]  Haiti back on January 12th is just the height of fear-mongering and ridiculous
[29:42.880 --> 29:46.480]  propaganda we're gonna come back continue with your phone calls and a ton of

[37:36.680 --> 37:41.240]  first day of February 2010 edition I'm gonna try to hurry through your calls
[37:41.240 --> 37:49.040]  now Chris in Georgia you're on the year welcome Alex hey buddy income the
[37:49.040 --> 37:55.640]  income tax what are you gonna tell the American people before April 15th
[37:55.640 --> 38:01.000]  regarding their liability well I tell people the same I tell people the same
[38:01.000 --> 38:04.240]  thing I tell them every year but I mean what would you like to say to them
[38:04.240 --> 38:17.280]  Chris there's a enormous potential to fight back by not paying if you so
[38:17.280 --> 38:24.280]  believe that you are one that is not obligated to pay I think that our best
[38:24.280 --> 38:31.120]  resistance is our refusal which is what Michael Collins said back in 1916 and
[38:31.120 --> 38:36.000]  then if a lot of Americans maybe hundreds of thousands more of them could
[38:36.000 --> 38:42.400]  see that they have no liability and they don't pay that that is a very
[38:42.400 --> 38:49.240]  effective and peaceful weapon to use against the world order Chris I agree
[38:49.240 --> 38:54.520]  with you and I appreciate your call it is a very important issue but it's also
[38:54.520 --> 39:02.440]  loaded with landmines and so briefly here is my position on it I pay the
[39:02.440 --> 39:12.560]  fraudulent illegal criminal income tax to the private Federal Reserve because I
[39:12.560 --> 39:18.400]  choose my battles I'm running a pretty good size operation it's tiny compared
[39:18.400 --> 39:22.880]  to you know bigger media operations but it reaches hundreds of millions a year
[39:22.880 --> 39:29.080]  conservatively tens of millions of new people new people that we reach every
[39:29.080 --> 39:34.200]  few months we're not just preaching to the choir here we are revolutionizing
[39:34.200 --> 39:40.680]  understanding and I have seen probably I'd say nine tenths of people who
[39:40.680 --> 39:46.000]  publicly don't pay the income tax and decide to go to war with them get set up
[39:46.000 --> 39:51.720]  get put before the IRS kangaroo courts and get sent to prison I have guessed on
[39:51.720 --> 39:55.440]  that exposed that it's a fraud that it's a tax paid to the private banks that we
[39:55.440 --> 39:59.400]  didn't have it till 1913 that it didn't become widespread until the mid 1950s
[39:59.400 --> 40:05.520]  was only about 1% until then I point out that we built this country without it
[40:05.520 --> 40:09.520]  that Ronald Reagan's own congressional commission in 81 found that not one red
[40:09.520 --> 40:13.320]  cent of your tax money goes to actually run the country and the income tax that
[40:13.320 --> 40:19.200]  there are literally scores of other taxes that are constitutional but I don't
[40:19.200 --> 40:22.600]  get up here on the air and tell people don't pay it I say you make that
[40:22.600 --> 40:31.560]  decision for yourself I make that decision for myself I tell you you
[40:31.560 --> 40:36.520]  should make that decision for yourself I've chosen my battles I sit up here I
[40:36.520 --> 40:41.360]  expose the IRS I made a film annual comprehensive a financial reports
[40:41.360 --> 40:48.040]  exposed where we show how the double set of books in government works and I'm
[40:48.040 --> 40:52.880]  also fighting all the new forms the fake environmental taxes the value added
[40:52.880 --> 40:59.040]  taxes the VAT the sales taxes that Glenn Becker pushing to pay the bankers and
[40:59.040 --> 41:02.880]  calling it conservative you know only Obama can bring people more war because
[41:02.880 --> 41:08.720]  he has left cover only Bill O'Reilly and Glenn Beck and call for new taxes
[41:08.720 --> 41:14.280]  because they're conservatives supposedly and somehow get away with it so I'm
[41:14.280 --> 41:18.480]  here exposing it but just like Aaron Russo says in reflections and warnings
[41:18.480 --> 41:24.080]  the film I produced you know I don't tell people not to pay your taxes they're
[41:24.080 --> 41:30.040]  the mafia they'll come and hurt you I don't tell people to play in traffic but
[41:30.040 --> 41:34.640]  what I do do is expose the entire system and say the American people need to take
[41:34.640 --> 41:40.040]  our country back abolish the IRS the income tax the 16th Amendment and arrest
[41:40.040 --> 41:44.480]  these criminal bankers that came in here and did this that is what I'm pushing
[41:44.480 --> 41:50.480]  for that is what I'm promoting and as a outspoken critic of them they would come
[41:50.480 --> 41:54.560]  in here with a SWAT team shut me down even if I beat them in court as some
[41:54.560 --> 41:59.200]  people do now do because we're educating the juries it would still shut down
[41:59.200 --> 42:06.960]  everything I'm doing and I'd be in jail like Erwin Schiff whose son now is
[42:06.960 --> 42:19.280]  running for president and so that's the issue and so that's what I do and
[42:19.280 --> 42:30.000]  that's where I stand on it plus we're fighting all these new taxes so that's
[42:30.000 --> 42:40.400]  the bottom line on the taxation issue let's go ahead and talk to anonymous in
[42:40.400 --> 42:46.360]  California go ahead you're on the air hi Alex I'm very uncomfortable calling in
[42:46.360 --> 42:51.280]  which is why I'm anonymous I was you know I never get though anonymous why don't
[42:51.280 --> 42:55.280]  you just call yourself Bill I mean it you know people always say I'm anonymous
[42:55.280 --> 43:01.280]  okay well I mean that's fine but why not just say my name's Bill fine I'm Bill
[43:01.280 --> 43:07.400]  I called into Jason show many months ago and warned that I can was going to
[43:07.400 --> 43:13.760]  escape US control and that you and was going to attempt to take over the
[43:13.760 --> 43:19.640]  internet well that that was on record last year that that happened well yeah
[43:19.640 --> 43:27.720]  I can escape control in September but nobody could know that beforehand for
[43:27.720 --> 43:31.720]  certain I believe I called into Jason show okay great well I mean it was in the
[43:31.720 --> 43:36.360]  news anyway it was in the news it was in newspapers I'm just confirming what
[43:36.360 --> 43:44.240]  you're saying oh okay understood there is I believe there is a way for people to
[43:44.240 --> 43:49.800]  defend against what's taking place and that's what I'd like to talk about but
[43:49.800 --> 43:54.480]  it's not gonna make any sense unless I give a little bit of background so give
[43:54.480 --> 43:58.240]  me a moment to try to give the background necessary to understand where
[43:58.240 --> 44:03.000]  the solution lays sure for those that don't know a lot of people tuning in
[44:03.000 --> 44:08.160]  don't know what I can is that was the naming system website registry that
[44:08.160 --> 44:12.360]  had been controlled by the US and a private corporate quasi governmental
[44:12.360 --> 44:18.480]  consortium that was given to the UN and an international body last year that was
[44:18.480 --> 44:25.800]  announced and now the UN at Davos is saying and you see Australia you see
[44:25.800 --> 44:30.360]  Italy openly coming out and saying you left a register to get on the web and
[44:30.360 --> 44:36.480]  that they will ban access to websites and they're now doing it so and then
[44:36.480 --> 44:39.840]  now internet too has been simultaneously over the last decade built at
[44:39.840 --> 44:44.400]  universities and government the cyber security act is building larger hubs the
[44:44.400 --> 44:50.360]  ISPs or any internet service provider of any size has to have hubs put into it and
[44:50.360 --> 44:53.560]  its codes are being given to the government so they are openly taking
[44:53.560 --> 44:56.960]  over the entire internet right now and it's been in the mainstream news CNET
[44:56.960 --> 45:04.920]  news AP mother Jones magazine that Obama has given speeches saying they may
[45:04.920 --> 45:09.560]  shut the old web down to create a quote newer safer one and I just read agency
[45:09.560 --> 45:15.080]  French press from yesterday saying the same thing at Davos so yes no more
[45:15.080 --> 45:20.920]  denial this is happening go ahead sir okay and let me just put some icing on
[45:20.920 --> 45:30.120]  that cake that you just made the new CEO of ICANN is Rod Beckstrom if people
[45:30.120 --> 45:35.400]  research Rod Beckstrom they will find that he was in line for the top Homeland
[45:35.400 --> 45:40.320]  Security position as far you know stop you again I'm gonna stop you again I
[45:40.320 --> 45:43.640]  don't know what's going on with muffled callers because it's not our phone
[45:43.640 --> 45:46.280]  system and half the callers sound incredibly muffled
[45:46.280 --> 45:52.240]  can you try to talk right into your receiver is that better not really
[45:52.240 --> 46:00.920]  your speakerphone no I'm not are you on a headset yes I am yeah I mean I know why
[46:00.920 --> 46:06.440]  phone quality just goes down and down and down yeah you know it's almost
[46:06.440 --> 46:11.640]  unlistable but just go ahead and make your point is that any better just go
[46:11.640 --> 46:18.760]  ahead sir finish just fine okay there's two parts to the internet there's the
[46:18.760 --> 46:22.080]  public part of the internet and there's a private part of the internet the private
[46:22.080 --> 46:27.520]  part of the internet would be analogous to the roads that we drive on the public
[46:27.520 --> 46:33.040]  part of the internet that the government controls the addressing system and so
[46:33.040 --> 46:38.160]  therefore if one were to somehow remove all the street signs and the addresses
[46:38.160 --> 46:42.480]  on the roads most people would not be able to find their way around some people
[46:42.480 --> 46:47.840]  still could because you know locally what's where and so the you and a select
[46:47.840 --> 46:52.200]  group of corporations are renaming everything to their new internet that
[46:52.200 --> 46:59.280]  has no freedom in their own words well what happens is I can is like the post
[46:59.280 --> 47:05.800]  office and controls the addresses and so therefore if the post office were to be
[47:05.800 --> 47:11.840]  able to wipe away all of the addresses then commerce would end nobody would be
[47:11.840 --> 47:18.480]  able to send something to anybody else so that's what I can is in the context of
[47:18.480 --> 47:23.200]  the internet but the roads are not owned by the government they're owned by
[47:23.200 --> 47:28.560]  private industry and cyber security is going in and taking over and setting up
[47:28.560 --> 47:35.640]  control checkpoints throughout the infrastructure yeah but if you dig a
[47:35.640 --> 47:39.680]  little deeper I think you're gonna find that that still connects back to the
[47:39.680 --> 47:45.040]  addressing system itself and that we don't want to go there because it gets
[47:45.040 --> 47:49.360]  ugly and I don't become capable of explaining it to your audience but here's
[47:49.360 --> 48:00.560]  the here's the key if people research alternate DNS route Google however what
[48:00.560 --> 48:06.400]  you will find is the existence of many companies and individuals who through
[48:06.400 --> 48:12.080]  huh since before I can't existed I've been working on setting up alternate
[48:12.080 --> 48:17.960]  addressing systems think of them like UPS so if the post office were to say
[48:17.960 --> 48:22.280]  okay we're gonna wipe away all the addresses then you say fine I'm gonna
[48:22.280 --> 48:27.080]  take my package to UPS because UPS isn't gonna play these games with me but
[48:27.080 --> 48:30.440]  the problem is the general public doesn't understand this so you're now
[48:30.440 --> 48:34.760]  informing them of this what we don't want is for them to start announcing
[48:34.760 --> 48:38.760]  internet to which they're doing and then at all the big companies moving to it
[48:38.760 --> 48:44.280]  with restrictions and then not upgrading the old hubs for what's known as the
[48:44.280 --> 48:52.640]  old internet you nailed it they don't there's been a great effort through the
[48:52.640 --> 49:00.360]  years to do what can be done to prevent these alternate DNS routes from gaining
[49:00.360 --> 49:07.120]  a hold and in your case I mean you can actually go and set an example by doing
[49:07.120 --> 49:12.480]  research on these routes and finding a top-level domain under those alternate
[49:12.480 --> 49:18.360]  routes that you like set up a domain name under those alternate routes so that
[49:18.360 --> 49:23.440]  people can access your websites through those alternate routes and then those
[49:23.440 --> 49:27.760]  people that do know how to use the alternate routes now if I can play
[49:27.760 --> 49:32.760]  games and shutdown.com people like me can certainly go to your site using the
[49:32.760 --> 49:36.920]  alternate route. I appreciate your call I gotta jump because I promise to spend
[49:36.920 --> 49:40.960]  other time with other callers but why don't you write a big article about this
[49:40.960 --> 49:46.200]  and send it to writersandinfowars.com and you can use the name Billy Bob if you
[49:46.200 --> 49:50.040]  want and we will post it we'll read over it make sure it's accurate and we'll
[49:50.040 --> 49:55.840]  post it but yes if you actually go back seven years ago five years ago three
[49:55.840 --> 50:03.240]  years ago I've had Paul Watson write articles that expose the entire
[50:03.240 --> 50:07.680]  architecture now I didn't just secretly look in a crystal ball and figure this
[50:07.680 --> 50:13.080]  out contrary to that I just read what internet two symposiums were saying when
[50:13.080 --> 50:16.480]  they met in Austin when they met in Chicago when they met in Tokyo and when
[50:16.480 --> 50:23.960]  they met in London and they their slogan is the internet is dead and they're
[50:23.960 --> 50:27.520]  building the new internet and saying you won't have freedom on it and then
[50:27.520 --> 50:33.440]  they're just gonna shut down the old domains incrementally and put taxes on
[50:33.440 --> 50:38.560]  email and one-day blockers on email and then use the licensing system then the
[50:38.560 --> 50:43.440]  the addressing system this is what China what India what a lot of other
[50:43.440 --> 50:47.960]  countries are doing what Australia is doing Italy they're now blocking
[50:47.960 --> 50:51.680]  addresses and saying you've got to have a license to get online this is now
[50:51.680 --> 50:55.880]  happening this isn't coming it's see it's not gonna happen all over night it's
[50:55.880 --> 51:02.480]  incremental it's happening now we're raising the alarm if you like vitamins

[54:45.040 --> 54:49.040]  Wars technology I'm not done saying this is true or not true I'm just gonna give
[54:49.040 --> 54:54.600]  you the information first of all let me tell you about how I got into contact
[54:54.600 --> 55:00.080]  with the information thank God I was awakened to all this stuff by by your
[55:00.080 --> 55:06.280]  radio station a few months back and I've been preparing ever since I went up into
[55:06.280 --> 55:10.000]  the mountains and looked for a nice little cabin away from everywhere and
[55:10.000 --> 55:14.720]  tried to get someone to rent me the cabin and the one I found the guy wouldn't
[55:14.720 --> 55:18.760]  let me rent it until I said that I was against the New World Order and I'm
[55:18.760 --> 55:23.040]  moving up there just prepare for all this and as soon as I said that his whole
[55:23.040 --> 55:27.280]  attitude changed he told me he was in the Navy for 15 years working on Star Wars
[55:27.280 --> 55:34.680]  technology what he said he worked on were lasers the most high-powered lasers
[55:34.680 --> 55:37.760]  you could possibly imagine he said he didn't have any idea what they were
[55:37.760 --> 55:42.440]  going to what they were intending on using a little particle beams
[55:42.440 --> 55:47.480]  particle beams sure and he said that he had worked on these lasers and soon as
[55:47.480 --> 55:52.520]  he had finished one of these most powerful lasers that he's ever the
[55:52.520 --> 55:56.000]  world's ever seen the first thing they did with it was stick it at stick it in
[55:56.000 --> 56:00.800]  an unmanned anti-gravitational flying devices which basically is a flying
[56:00.800 --> 56:06.160]  saucer yes the United States government does have flying saucers but anyways he
[56:06.160 --> 56:10.040]  said they stuck it in they stuck it in one of these saucers and first thing
[56:10.040 --> 56:15.840]  they did with it is send it out to the ocean and start shooting the ocean with
[56:15.840 --> 56:20.040]  the laser heating up the water trying to create hurricanes and he said soon as
[56:20.040 --> 56:25.480]  he found out that this is what they were doing with it he totally went against
[56:25.480 --> 56:30.200]  them they and and started talking out against it and soon as he did that they
[56:30.200 --> 56:35.880]  set up the one of the lasers that he was working on in a bad way in which it
[56:35.880 --> 56:41.400]  when he came into work to work on it it ended up blinding him and so he just
[56:41.400 --> 56:46.000]  basically like told me all these different things but I'm a survival
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.240]  expert and I just wanted to let every listener out there know how important
[56:50.240 --> 56:56.160]  it is that they have freeze-dried foods go go on to the websites that you you
[56:56.160 --> 57:01.560]  tell Alex Jones tells the people buy the food it's the most important thing
[57:01.560 --> 57:05.520]  that's that you could possibly do Marshall I appreciate your call and I'm
[57:05.520 --> 57:11.600]  not poo-pooing what you're saying but it's on record that they have DC 10s
[57:11.600 --> 57:15.920]  with giant chemical lasers that run almost the entire length of the plane to
[57:15.920 --> 57:21.120]  shoot down missiles and to attack personnel and vehicles so they can be
[57:21.120 --> 57:26.040]  offensive and defensive it's on record they do giant laser test publicly all
[57:26.040 --> 57:32.080]  the time and blow ICBMs out of the air I mean that stuff's been around for 30
[57:32.080 --> 57:38.200]  years that we know of generally someone in the Navy working on high-powered
[57:38.200 --> 57:43.600]  lasers would not know then what they were using them for any in a classified
[57:43.600 --> 57:48.520]  project it would be compartmentalized unless he was a project director and
[57:48.520 --> 57:51.760]  and still that they would be compartmentalized that's how they keep
[57:51.760 --> 57:55.360]  people from government from knowing what's going on I have talked to the
[57:55.360 --> 58:00.240]  former head of Star Wars it has leaked out and been public so he could talk
[58:00.240 --> 58:05.160]  about that that they do have unmanned space planes in orbit but they're
[58:05.160 --> 58:08.520]  mainly not particle beam weapon platforms because those are so heavy to
[58:08.520 --> 58:15.480]  put into orbit that they have DU Sabo weapons or meteor guns where they drop
[58:15.480 --> 58:19.640]  DU into the atmosphere and then when it hits the ground it's going 35 40,000
[58:19.640 --> 58:24.480]  miles an hour and has the equivalent impact of a low yield nuclear weapon a
[58:24.480 --> 58:30.720]  super bunker buster so we could do a whole show on secret weapons some other
[58:30.720 --> 58:38.040]  time but it is very interesting we'll be right back with tons of news and your
[58:38.040 --> 58:41.560]  calls second hour straight ahead

[59:48.960 --> 1:00:00.480]  today waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio networks
[1:00:04.360 --> 1:00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.160 --> 1:00:19.680]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:43.440]  Alex Jones we're back live ladies and gentlemen hour number two we had a call
[1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:47.480]  or call in about it earlier but I actually want to break it down enemies of
[1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:52.120]  free speech call for internet licensing death of the web moves closer as you in
[1:00:52.120 --> 1:01:00.400]  calls for policing cyberspace that is coming up also more than saber
[1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:06.920]  rattling military equipment build-ups openly to face down Iran we'll also look
[1:01:06.920 --> 1:01:11.600]  at the economy we'll look at this key report at info wars.com written by
[1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:16.520]  Kurt Haskell the sharp-dressed man who aided the underwear bomber on flight
[1:01:16.520 --> 1:01:21.920]  253 was a US government agent huge developments there another article from
[1:01:21.920 --> 1:01:29.720]  veterans today and actually glean this from USA today Senate burglary CIA
[1:01:29.720 --> 1:01:36.920]  domestic black op team arrested with that Landru situation down in Louisiana
[1:01:36.920 --> 1:01:42.760]  we're gonna be going over that as well today but I am continuing right now with
[1:01:42.760 --> 1:01:50.200]  open phones and your phone calls let's go ahead and go to Fred in Ohio Fred
[1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:57.080]  thanks for holding. What I'm suggesting is a May Day May Day is a distress call
[1:01:57.080 --> 1:02:03.720]  and our country is positively in distress so we should have a protest slash
[1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:09.560]  tea party on May the 1st and the biggest that we ever put together to stop
[1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:18.760]  this government nonsense of ours. Continue? Well that was my idea to put
[1:02:18.760 --> 1:02:23.960]  that together because and make sure that you just have patriots talking at these
[1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:30.760]  tea parties no politicians no well those like Ron Paul would be okay but the
[1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:35.720]  rest of these politicians are Democrat Republicans they're both in the same boat
[1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:42.080]  just not the communists is all that they are so that was my idea to get this
[1:02:42.080 --> 1:02:47.680]  going and really a big big protest all across this United States. Well we do
[1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:53.160]  need to see the tea parties come out against the IRS and the phony wars in
[1:02:53.160 --> 1:02:57.600]  the police state and they were doing that until the really big ones got co-opted
[1:02:57.600 --> 1:03:02.280]  and taken over by Glenn Beck and others and now Glenn Beck's calling for new
[1:03:02.280 --> 1:03:06.080]  taxes on top of the income tax because we got to pay the bankers all the money
[1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:09.440]  they've stolen you know we've got to I mean that we don't just give them the
[1:03:09.440 --> 1:03:13.400]  bankers trillions they then loan it back to us in interest so you know that's the
[1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:18.280]  new tea party slogan is pay more taxes government's good basically and that's
[1:03:18.280 --> 1:03:23.040]  why I've had such a problem with Glenn Beck. We had Dick army at the last tea
[1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:32.440]  party which is ridiculous too. Well Dick army is is not very good but he's
[1:03:32.440 --> 1:03:36.120]  certainly better than Glenn Beck but yeah no I mean the mainline Republicans the
[1:03:36.120 --> 1:03:41.520]  ones that tripled the size of government are now calling for sales taxes
[1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:49.400]  value-added taxes excise taxes because we've got this deficit you know we can't
[1:03:49.400 --> 1:03:54.760]  cut government no no we just got to have a new tax and I tuned in to Glenn Beck a
[1:03:54.760 --> 1:03:59.840]  few days a week and every time I tune in he must just parrot it like a macaw
[1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:03.840]  parrot gotta have a new tax gotta have a new tax gotta have a new tax gotta have
[1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:08.120]  a new tax 9-11 truthers are bad they want to kill the president 9-11 truthers
[1:04:08.120 --> 1:04:13.720]  are bad Ron Paul supporters are bad Ron Paul's a cook but I like Ron Paul there
[1:04:13.720 --> 1:04:19.560]  are no FEMA camps there are no FEMA camps I kind of like the Homeland Security
[1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:22.920]  Report maybe there are dangerous gun owners maybe there are dangerous gun
[1:04:22.920 --> 1:04:29.680]  owners people are like man I like him that's conservative we don't hear Glenn
[1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:35.200]  Beck talking about the fact that the government helped the underwater
[1:04:35.200 --> 1:04:40.360]  underwear bomber get on the plane or we're protecting him we don't hear
[1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:47.760]  anything about that no we just hear about how bad Obama is and how he's a
[1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:51.640]  communist yeah he's got a bunch of communists as administration because
[1:04:51.640 --> 1:04:54.520]  that's who bankers used to rob people we'll be right back with more of your
[1:04:54.520 --> 1:05:02.600]  calls and a ton of news this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[1:05:02.600 --> 1:05:07.040]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[1:05:07.040 --> 1:05:11.080]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:05:11.080 --> 1:05:14.960]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:19.000]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:23.560]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:05:23.560 --> 1:05:27.600]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:05:27.600 --> 1:05:31.400]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:05:31.400 --> 1:05:35.000]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:39.320]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[1:05:39.320 --> 1:05:42.480]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[1:05:42.480 --> 1:05:46.160]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:51.720]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[1:05:51.720 --> 1:05:56.480]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[1:05:56.480 --> 1:06:04.360]  1-877-327-0365 hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the
[1:06:04.360 --> 1:06:08.800]  silver lungs generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[1:06:08.800 --> 1:06:12.800]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the
[1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:16.600]  solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line of
[1:06:16.600 --> 1:06:20.480]  defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator
[1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:25.320]  infuses the respiratory system with yourself produced nano silver solutions
[1:06:25.320 --> 1:06:30.200]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[1:06:30.200 --> 1:06:35.160]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can
[1:06:35.160 --> 1:06:39.800]  now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator
[1:06:39.800 --> 1:06:43.940]  very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided making
[1:06:43.940 --> 1:06:50.240]  production fast and simple go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more
[1:06:50.240 --> 1:07:00.440]  about the breakthrough technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[1:07:00.440 --> 1:07:05.240]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[1:07:05.240 --> 1:07:09.920]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[1:07:09.920 --> 1:07:14.480]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home tremendous
[1:07:14.480 --> 1:07:19.520]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[1:07:19.520 --> 1:07:24.960]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:29.880]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[1:07:29.880 --> 1:07:34.240]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[1:07:34.240 --> 1:07:38.000]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:41.960]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[1:07:41.960 --> 1:07:47.600]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[1:07:47.600 --> 1:07:53.640]  Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars com we're
[1:07:53.640 --> 1:08:02.520]  watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet TV from his
[1:08:02.520 --> 1:08:07.440]  central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war
[1:08:07.440 --> 1:08:25.560]  continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:08:25.560 --> 1:08:30.840]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen continuing with your phone calls today
[1:08:30.840 --> 1:08:34.920]  that I'm getting into this key story enemies of free speech call for internet
[1:08:34.920 --> 1:08:40.480]  licensing death of the web moves closer as you in calls for policing cyberspace
[1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:46.080]  right now let's go to Joe in Illinois Joe you're on the air go ahead you're
[1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:55.200]  doing buddy good hey I wanted to call in and give my reaction to Obama's the state
[1:08:55.200 --> 1:09:00.840]  of the Union speech he gave last week and I don't know when I was watching it I
[1:09:00.840 --> 1:09:06.840]  was taken aback by this he made this statement that you know Gore and everyone
[1:09:06.840 --> 1:09:13.000]  else been making for the past year it's like despite the overwhelming scientific
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:19.840]  evidence that proves global warming there's still those to the contrary then
[1:09:19.840 --> 1:09:23.480]  you know all the Republicans started laughing and I understand you know they're
[1:09:23.480 --> 1:09:29.160]  laughing like oh yeah another Al Gorely and then you see Pelosi laugh and Biden
[1:09:29.160 --> 1:09:34.400]  laugh and all the big panel at the audience all the Democrats Obama it's
[1:09:34.400 --> 1:09:39.160]  like they're all laughing at it it's like a joke it's like I'm looking at this
[1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:44.000]  it's like man what kind of audacity these people have just to sit here and laugh
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:50.520]  at their own lies and expect us to sit there and and just believe they have
[1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:55.720]  absolute you fit the nail on the head Joe they have absolute total systemic
[1:09:55.720 --> 1:10:03.000]  across the board absolute complete contempt for the people I mean they
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:09.480]  openly knew the guy was on a terror watch list protected him blocked him from
[1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:14.520]  being blocked got him on the airplane helped him get on the airplane lied
[1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:18.360]  about the other guy reportedly with a bomb told the media that wasn't true
[1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:21.600]  they've now backed off of that and that's coming up later I'm gonna break that
[1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:27.840]  down I mean yes this is audacity naked body scanners recording our genitals and
[1:10:27.840 --> 1:10:32.000]  on record they record it and keep it on a hard drive that's been admitted then
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:34.800]  they go on the news and say don't worry we can't see your genitals we don't
[1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:42.480]  record it when it's a lie the entire UN program the entire UN IPCC reports from
[1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:47.880]  95 on have all been proven to be lies all been proven to be frauds eight years
[1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:52.480]  ago the UN said that the North Pole would be completely melted by now it
[1:10:52.480 --> 1:10:59.680]  isn't they point satellite cameras at the poles during the summer and then they
[1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:02.640]  have different Arctic and Antarctic summers different times of the year and
[1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:07.440]  they show the ice cap shrink in the summer and tell you it's all melting
[1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:13.400]  they don't show you the winter when it gets bigger again they just folks they
[1:11:13.400 --> 1:11:17.240]  show people on the news every time I watch television they cover global
[1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:21.440]  warming they show them icebergs and say look it's all melting there's always
[1:11:21.440 --> 1:11:25.520]  been icebergs they'd always breaks off during the summer and spring I mean
[1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:30.880]  that again on every subject look for 50 years they've told us there's no new
[1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:34.600]  world order and the fellow reserve isn't private stonewalling us when it's a
[1:11:34.600 --> 1:11:40.280]  fact they announce a world government thousands of times in the last 14 months
[1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:45.080]  after decades of denying it and still come out and say you're a cook if you
[1:11:45.080 --> 1:11:50.120]  don't want it I mean yes they treat us like we're complete morons because the
[1:11:50.120 --> 1:11:55.080]  general public still isn't focused on the way the world works people are
[1:11:55.080 --> 1:11:57.720]  finally starting to not trust government and not believing what the
[1:11:57.720 --> 1:12:01.960]  government says and the media says but at the same time that's not enough people
[1:12:01.960 --> 1:12:05.440]  need to really burrow into this Joe and find out what's really happening
[1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:11.200]  anything else yeah there's another thing I wanted another statement regarding
[1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:15.960]  any anonymous callers it's it's just this heartening to me that in this great
[1:12:15.960 --> 1:12:21.200]  country home of the free landed the brave we had four fathers that fought
[1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:27.600]  and died for our right to get together and use our free speech and for callers
[1:12:27.600 --> 1:12:32.000]  to come on and you know especially on an issue like free speech issue like the
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:37.600]  internet and then want to be anonymous it's like what are you afraid of I mean
[1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:43.520]  my name is Joe Healy I'm talking to Alex Jones I'm an American I'm mad as hell
[1:12:43.520 --> 1:12:48.600]  I'm gonna tell everyone about it and I'm not you know what Alex I'm not worried
[1:12:48.600 --> 1:12:52.720]  about the Gestapo or the government coming in they're not gonna kick in my
[1:12:52.720 --> 1:12:58.600]  door tonight they're not gonna take me away this is America God bless America
[1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:02.760]  absolutely Joe I appreciate your call I appreciate your call of your spirit I
[1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:10.160]  can't tell you how many neighbors people in business family they'll say Alex you
[1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:13.880]  know I'm in the military and believe me I know we're preparing for riot control
[1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:19.600]  and takeover of society but I'm scared to speak out well in the military you
[1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:23.640]  can understand why but neighbors and others go yeah I know there's a new
[1:13:23.640 --> 1:13:27.600]  world order but I'm afraid to speak up against it it's that buffaloing it's
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:33.720]  that attitude it's that capitulation as if we're the bad guys we're afraid to
[1:13:33.720 --> 1:13:37.640]  speak out against the bad guys and we're the bad guys for speaking out against
[1:13:37.640 --> 1:13:41.600]  them so we better do it in in hush tones but it's more than that it's the
[1:13:41.600 --> 1:13:52.280]  irrational fear of calling in and wanting you to know it's anonymous when
[1:13:52.280 --> 1:13:56.120]  obviously just use a fake name you don't want your first name I mean it's
[1:13:56.120 --> 1:14:02.720]  anonymous to call in with your first name but make one up but that that's
[1:14:02.720 --> 1:14:05.840]  somebody and I'm not being mean to him but that's somebody at a subconscious
[1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:12.640]  level that feels safer for himself if he tells you it's anonymous if he tells
[1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:20.560]  himself it's anonymous when in truth with big brother nothing is anonymous very
[1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:25.040]  very few places are anonymous now and that's why the globalists have announced
[1:14:25.040 --> 1:14:30.040]  the surveillance and the spying and all the demonization and that's why the
[1:14:30.040 --> 1:14:35.480]  media was more than happy to report on the homeland security documents that's
[1:14:35.480 --> 1:14:39.240]  why they were more than happy to report on the fact that they're watching
[1:14:39.240 --> 1:14:42.760]  veterans and gun owners and conservatives and libertarians because they
[1:14:42.760 --> 1:14:49.040]  think you're cowards they think they can come out and say it's not societally
[1:14:49.040 --> 1:14:53.520]  acceptable to criticize big government and that you'll say okay I won't talk
[1:14:53.520 --> 1:15:01.320]  about it is that true I mean have we fallen that far is that really who we
[1:15:01.320 --> 1:15:09.960]  are I think about the yuppies in the middle class and the well-to-do people
[1:15:09.960 --> 1:15:14.800]  who were being hurt by this system like everybody else things are tough all
[1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:20.640]  over who won't even talk about politics with their neighbor because they don't
[1:15:20.640 --> 1:15:24.440]  want to make their neighbor or themselves uncomfortable so many people are so
[1:15:24.440 --> 1:15:31.040]  self-centered so lazy so selfish that they won't spend any of their time or
[1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:36.520]  energy fighting corruption or they don't have any respect for themselves and so
[1:15:36.520 --> 1:15:42.480]  they can't even imagine themselves in that role you have to envision yourself
[1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:48.000]  in the role of a leader and then so many others when they decide to get
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:51.840]  politically active they start trying to convince anybody else who's got a radio
[1:15:51.840 --> 1:15:56.640]  show or a website that their way is the way to do it that they have all the
[1:15:56.640 --> 1:16:00.880]  answers and that they know what to do and that you need to do what they say
[1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:07.360]  you need to do what they think you need to promote their ideas no the answer is
[1:16:07.360 --> 1:16:12.520]  having a wider debate informing our fellow Americans and humans about the
[1:16:12.520 --> 1:16:17.760]  nature of the new world order and saying do we as a human people want to live
[1:16:17.760 --> 1:16:24.360]  under this authoritarian unelected global corporate tyranny do we that's the
[1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:27.760]  big question all of you out there have to ask yourselves you have to ask
[1:16:27.760 --> 1:16:31.840]  yourselves whose side are you on well to make that decision you've got to find
[1:16:31.840 --> 1:16:36.400]  out what the sides are and the sides are global private banks buying up the
[1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:41.240]  world through fraud money they printed up who happen to be a bunch of you
[1:16:41.240 --> 1:16:46.720]  Genesis who are poisoning our food and water and playing God and an erase for
[1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:51.040]  high-tech weapons and life extension technologies to secure their global
[1:16:51.040 --> 1:16:58.360]  domination now that's what we've got to have a debate about but the globalists
[1:16:58.360 --> 1:17:01.440]  are pretty secure right now because even though the public's waking up they can
[1:17:01.440 --> 1:17:05.200]  still just confound us and confuse us and get us in fighting with each other
[1:17:05.200 --> 1:17:08.160]  and get us arguing with each other because we are just human beings none of
[1:17:08.160 --> 1:17:15.560]  us are perfect but the good news is I've been here and countless others have been
[1:17:15.560 --> 1:17:23.480]  here for decades laying out the real new world order battle plan to the point of
[1:17:23.480 --> 1:17:33.720]  now to the point of now we've got a chance as things get worse for people to
[1:17:33.720 --> 1:17:37.360]  really know who screwed them who nailed them to the wall Billy in Vegas you're
[1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:42.040]  on the air hey Alex we can win this thing I know it I want to tell you
[1:17:42.040 --> 1:17:45.200]  something I've been doing in Vegas it's very very effective I know I'm not the
[1:17:45.200 --> 1:17:48.960]  first to do it but I've been going to very busy intersections with a sign on
[1:17:48.960 --> 1:17:52.720]  my front a sign on my back the sign on the front says America is being
[1:17:52.720 --> 1:17:57.440]  destroyed by design wake up and the back says stand against tyranny info words
[1:17:57.440 --> 1:18:01.880]  calm and I'll tell you the response is overwhelming I mean everybody young
[1:18:01.880 --> 1:18:06.280]  old black white Hispanic they're giving me the thumbs up they're beeping the horn
[1:18:06.280 --> 1:18:09.840]  then you give them the disc you give them full of the Republic I want to tell
[1:18:09.840 --> 1:18:13.000]  all your listeners who want to do something and they don't want to know
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:17.960]  what to do they can do this by the fall of the Republic support Alex by the
[1:18:17.960 --> 1:18:22.760]  Obama deception make copies go out to these busy intersections be confident
[1:18:22.760 --> 1:18:28.000]  and people will eat them up they know what they're ready for it well you're
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:34.360]  absolutely right and if 10 million Americans would do what you're doing we
[1:18:34.360 --> 1:18:39.080]  would wake this country up overnight now our people responding to the Americas
[1:18:39.080 --> 1:18:43.120]  being destroyed by design more than they're responding to the info wars
[1:18:43.120 --> 1:18:47.040]  dot com because again people that put info wars dot com on their cars get
[1:18:47.040 --> 1:18:51.680]  honked at wave debt everywhere they go another indicator of how many info

[1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:16.200]  they're remembering it or something but are some people recognizing the info

[1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:35.880]  Okay, going back to Billy in Vegas, Sean Hannity, we have a short clip of this in
[1:24:35.880 --> 1:24:36.880]  Fall of the Republic.
[1:24:36.880 --> 1:24:45.880]  He didn't know what to do when he's had, well, multiple guests on his show talking about
[1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:49.920]  how world governments openly being announced by the G20, world governments openly being
[1:24:49.920 --> 1:24:54.080]  announced by the UN, a global government oven for the bankers.
[1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:59.320]  Last Friday, there was a big Bloomberg article saying yes, there is a secret cabal of global
[1:24:59.320 --> 1:25:01.320]  bankers taking over the planet.
[1:25:01.320 --> 1:25:05.960]  Now we have all these different congressmen from the Republican and Democratic parties
[1:25:05.960 --> 1:25:12.840]  in the last year coming out and saying banks and foreign banks run America.
[1:25:12.840 --> 1:25:19.000]  It's illegitimate, it's fraudulent, it's criminal, but all these years Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh,
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:26.680]  has lent back, have all denied global government and it is their listeners calling them, demanding
[1:25:26.680 --> 1:25:33.440]  they cover this that is now making them begin to tell the truth or they will lose all credibility
[1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:36.060]  and won't even be in the game anymore.
[1:25:36.060 --> 1:25:41.520]  So you're saying that in the end Billy, Sean Hannity, who has been one of the worst deniers
[1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:45.320]  of this, I've seen him say arrest all militia members.
[1:25:45.320 --> 1:25:50.640]  I mean this guy's bad news, I've got video of him saying all children need implantable
[1:25:50.640 --> 1:25:55.400]  microchips when he had the Verichip company, Digital Angel on.
[1:25:55.400 --> 1:25:57.520]  What did he say when you talked to him?
[1:25:57.520 --> 1:26:00.720]  Well he tried to rub it off on the Democrats.
[1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:05.200]  You know Hillary Clinton saying she wants to give all the third world nations, you know,
[1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:09.160]  all kinds of billions of dollars and I'm trying to shout through the phone telling them no,
[1:26:09.160 --> 1:26:13.000]  it's both sides, but they cut you as soon as you're done talking, they put you on to
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:15.160]  where you can't speak anymore.
[1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:16.160]  Well it doesn't matter.
[1:26:16.160 --> 1:26:17.160]  The facts are wrong.
[1:26:17.160 --> 1:26:18.160]  I don't listen to his show.
[1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:19.720]  I was listening to your show and just calling up.
[1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:21.960]  I didn't even know what they were talking about and they said, what do you want to talk
[1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:22.960]  about?
[1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:23.960]  I said, well, I got a great Reagan quote.
[1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:27.240]  I want to tell them what a fan I am and they said, well, we're talking about something
[1:26:27.240 --> 1:26:30.320]  important right now, we'll call you back tomorrow.
[1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:33.840]  So I had all night to prep about it, at first I was going to pull a marked dice, you know,
[1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:37.280]  and just say you're a new world order show, then I said, maybe if I can get some information
[1:26:37.280 --> 1:26:41.360]  out that his people don't know, you know, that would be helpful too.
[1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:43.680]  Well good job Billy because you reach millions of people.
[1:26:43.680 --> 1:26:44.680]  Thank you.
[1:26:44.680 --> 1:26:46.400]  Let's talk to John in Jersey.
[1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:48.400]  John, you're on the air.
[1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:50.600]  Can you hear me?
[1:26:50.600 --> 1:26:51.600]  Yes, sir.
[1:26:51.600 --> 1:26:54.160]  Hey Alex, my name is John from Jersey.
[1:26:54.160 --> 1:27:00.960]  I'm a member of the National Guard and about a month ago we had something called an SRC
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:06.040]  and what that is is that we pretty much, we go in there and they give us our medical
[1:27:06.040 --> 1:27:08.920]  updates and we take our vaccines.
[1:27:08.920 --> 1:27:13.480]  And I would say when we got to the vaccine line, I would say about a 45 to 50% of the
[1:27:13.480 --> 1:27:16.760]  guys there didn't want to take the H1N1 vaccine.
[1:27:16.760 --> 1:27:20.920]  They were all saying they didn't want to take it and they said that pretty much they were
[1:27:20.920 --> 1:27:25.040]  unsure that we were going to test it or whatever, but what it made us take it anyway.
[1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:29.000]  But it's going to let you know that a lot of the military is waking up to what you're
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  doing and I appreciate what you're doing, Alex.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:35.440]  Well, let me tell you something, my friend, and we appreciate your service.
[1:27:35.440 --> 1:27:37.320]  Here's the bottom line.
[1:27:37.320 --> 1:27:42.120]  When you're in the military, they can force you because you've signed the contract to
[1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:48.400]  waive your rights to take approved vaccines, but this vaccine was never approved except
[1:27:48.400 --> 1:27:51.000]  for emergency experimental use.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:55.800]  That's how we got them to stop the smallpox and the anthrax shots, smallpox once anthrax
[1:27:55.800 --> 1:27:57.480]  twice.
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:01.920]  And so what they did was illegal, but we played the news reports where they're forcibly inoculating
[1:28:01.920 --> 1:28:07.680]  school kids, even when their parents say don't do it, they line them up and do it.
[1:28:07.680 --> 1:28:11.240]  Now here's the other issue.
[1:28:11.240 --> 1:28:20.200]  And 11% is the media number I've seen as many illnesses and deaths from this H1N1 than what
[1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:22.720]  people have from the regular seasonal flu.
[1:28:22.720 --> 1:28:25.480]  It is an extremely mild flu.
[1:28:25.480 --> 1:28:30.840]  Top scientists are on record saying it's genetically engineered.
[1:28:30.840 --> 1:28:35.960]  And we've got even the EU health minister coming out saying it's all a fraud that they
[1:28:35.960 --> 1:28:41.320]  paid off government ministers to come out and hype it, that it's a dangerous vaccine,
[1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:46.440]  the German military wouldn't take it, the government officials wouldn't take it.
[1:28:46.440 --> 1:28:49.360]  It's making a lot of people sick that take it.
[1:28:49.360 --> 1:28:50.960]  And I just think it's outrageous.
[1:28:50.960 --> 1:28:55.960]  They tried to make nurses and doctors and police take it in New York and Boston and
[1:28:55.960 --> 1:29:00.080]  Massachusetts total and people sued and beat that.
[1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:04.120]  And it's just horrible that our military are used like guinea pigs.
[1:29:04.120 --> 1:29:08.720]  And so you're saying around 45% of the guys were saying no, but they still did it.
[1:29:08.720 --> 1:29:10.960]  Did they threaten you?
[1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:15.360]  They would tell us that it was up to our chain of command whether or not we would get punished,
[1:29:15.360 --> 1:29:21.000]  but the possible punishment for it were with an article 15 reduction in pay and reduction
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:25.080]  in rank if we refused to take the vaccine.
[1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:26.080]  And so you took it?
[1:29:26.080 --> 1:29:29.760]  Oh, yes, I took it because I really had no choice.
[1:29:29.760 --> 1:29:32.680]  Well, thank God you didn't get sick, John.
[1:29:32.680 --> 1:29:36.480]  Oh, thanks, buddy.
[1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:37.480]  Anything else, John?
[1:29:37.480 --> 1:29:38.480]  No, that's everything.
[1:29:38.480 --> 1:29:39.480]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:29:39.480 --> 1:29:40.480]  I appreciate it.
[1:29:40.480 --> 1:29:43.480]  I appreciate you for what you're doing and you woke me up to the New World Order.
[1:29:43.480 --> 1:29:44.480]  Thank you.
[1:29:44.480 --> 1:29:45.480]  I appreciate you, John.
[1:29:45.480 --> 1:29:46.480]  God bless you.
[1:29:46.480 --> 1:29:47.480]  Okay.
[1:29:47.480 --> 1:29:48.480]  I'm going to blitz news straight ahead.
[1:29:48.480 --> 1:29:51.160]  The more your call, stay with us.
[1:29:51.160 --> 1:29:52.440]  We're on the march.
[1:29:52.440 --> 1:29:54.960]  The empire's on the run.
[1:29:54.960 --> 1:30:00.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:00.600 --> 1:30:05.880]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[1:30:05.880 --> 1:30:08.600]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world.
[1:30:08.600 --> 1:30:13.600]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[1:30:13.600 --> 1:30:18.440]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from infowars.com.

[1:30:33.960 --> 1:30:34.960]  place.
[1:30:34.960 --> 1:30:36.720]  This film needs to be seen.

[1:30:59.000 --> 1:31:04.120]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:31:04.120 --> 1:31:08.480]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[1:31:08.480 --> 1:31:09.480]  do you want?
[1:31:09.480 --> 1:31:11.480]  My answer would be all I can get.
[1:31:11.480 --> 1:31:16.480]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[1:31:16.480 --> 1:31:17.720]  How much do you want?
[1:31:17.720 --> 1:31:18.720]  When do you want it?
[1:31:18.720 --> 1:31:20.760]  Now or after the battle starts.
[1:31:20.760 --> 1:31:21.880]  When will you need it?
[1:31:21.880 --> 1:31:25.320]  When you buy it without proper identification, will there be any food?
[1:31:25.320 --> 1:31:26.800]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:31:26.800 --> 1:31:30.920]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:31:30.920 --> 1:31:32.080]  and be immunized?
[1:31:32.080 --> 1:31:35.880]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:31:35.880 --> 1:31:39.480]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:31:39.480 --> 1:31:40.720]  How much will you need?
[1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:41.720]  We don't know.
[1:31:41.720 --> 1:31:42.720]  How much do you want?
[1:31:42.720 --> 1:31:43.720]  All you can get.
[1:31:43.720 --> 1:31:44.720]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:31:44.720 --> 1:31:47.920]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[1:31:55.280 --> 1:32:00.560]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[1:32:00.560 --> 1:32:01.640]  What's your home worth?
[1:32:01.640 --> 1:32:03.760]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[1:32:03.760 --> 1:32:06.760]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[1:32:06.760 --> 1:32:10.560]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house,

[1:33:39.200 --> 1:33:40.200]  are back live.
[1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:46.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.
[1:33:46.520 --> 1:33:50.280]  I'm going to get into enemies of free speech, call for internet licensing, this issue is
[1:33:50.280 --> 1:33:54.880]  so huge, we know their battle plan, we know how to fight them, then I want to get into
[1:33:54.880 --> 1:33:59.520]  the sharp dressed man who aided the underwear bomber on the flight 253 was a U.S. government
[1:33:59.520 --> 1:34:03.280]  agent that is hidden in plain view.
[1:34:03.280 --> 1:34:19.040]  I also want to cover what is happening with the gear up towards war with Iran, because
[1:34:19.040 --> 1:34:28.240]  they are certainly moving in that direction and look to see more staged terror, more staged
[1:34:28.240 --> 1:34:37.560]  crises in the lead up to an attack on that nation.
[1:34:37.560 --> 1:34:43.560]  I want to talk about the aftermath of that and what that would look like.
[1:34:43.560 --> 1:34:52.640]  But getting into the news right now, the internet is killing the new world order.
[1:34:52.640 --> 1:34:58.880]  They can't allow it to continue in its present form and that's why Australia is following
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:00.840]  in the footsteps of China.
[1:35:00.840 --> 1:35:08.040]  That's why Italy is following in the footsteps of China.
[1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:12.800]  That's why England is openly saying they may start censoring and taxing and controlling
[1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:13.800]  the web.
[1:35:13.800 --> 1:35:16.880]  That's why our government that created the internet has handed it over to the United
[1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:25.920]  Nations, the web domain registry addressing system.
[1:35:25.920 --> 1:35:32.280]  This article up on prisonplanet.com is so important.
[1:35:32.280 --> 1:35:36.640]  Enemies of free speech call for internet licensing.
[1:35:36.640 --> 1:35:42.000]  Paul Watson, Alex Jones and Steve Watson are the authors of this.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  Both of the web moves closer as UN calls for policing cyberspace.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:51.640]  They always announce they're going to do something after the grid is already in place.
[1:35:51.640 --> 1:35:55.640]  We had a national ID card under executive order in 1993.
[1:35:55.640 --> 1:35:59.480]  The states were federalized and standardized with the issuance.
[1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:01.920]  Now they admit it to you.
[1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:07.240]  Many years later, the real ID, they've been listening to people's phone calls and reading
[1:36:07.240 --> 1:36:14.800]  their emails for decades before they announced in the last three years they were doing it.
[1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:17.280]  They ordered the naked body scanners a year ago.
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:21.800]  They announced they're going to put them in two months ago.
[1:36:21.800 --> 1:36:24.440]  This is their MO.
[1:36:24.440 --> 1:36:30.600]  Enemies of free speech call for internet licensing.
[1:36:30.600 --> 1:36:35.760]  Calls to introduce a licensing system to police the internet on behalf of a powerful UN agency
[1:36:35.760 --> 1:36:41.720]  to represent the latest salvo in a long-running battle to kill free speech on the web and
[1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:47.800]  bring an end to the powerful digital democracy that has devastated the carbon tax agenda
[1:36:47.800 --> 1:36:55.240]  of the UN by exposing the climate-gate scandal and the WMDs and the rest of it.
[1:36:55.240 --> 1:37:04.120]  UN International Telecommunications Union Secretary General, I hope I'm pronouncing
[1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:12.000]  this right, Hamadov Tor told the World Economic Forum in Davos this past weekend that global
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:17.960]  treaties need to be enacted in the name of stopping cyber warfare.
[1:37:17.960 --> 1:37:21.240]  Perfect for our own criminal government or corporations to launch attacks.
[1:37:21.240 --> 1:37:24.440]  They've been caught doing it and blaming it on their enemies.
[1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:29.720]  Craig Mundy, chief research and strategy officer at Microsoft, who's built the architecture
[1:37:29.720 --> 1:37:33.680]  for this as well as in China, called fellow globalist at the summit that the internet
[1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:38.800]  needed to be policed by means of introducing licenses similar to driver's license.
[1:37:38.800 --> 1:37:43.440]  In other words, government permission to use the web, just like China.
[1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:47.480]  We need a kind of world health organization for the internet, he said.
[1:37:47.480 --> 1:37:52.200]  If you want to drive a car, you have to have a license to say you're capable of driving
[1:37:52.200 --> 1:37:53.560]  a car.
[1:37:53.560 --> 1:38:00.120]  The car has to pass a test to say it is fit to drive and you have to have insurance.
[1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:06.760]  President Dre Koldalski, chairman of Koldalski Group, said that people should be forced
[1:38:06.760 --> 1:38:13.040]  to, quote, have two computers that cannot connect and pass on viruses.
[1:38:13.040 --> 1:38:17.280]  Since using the internet requires a computer to connect to a network, it seems unclear
[1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:20.880]  as how this would work without blocking off entire areas of the internet altogether.
[1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:24.240]  Well, that's what Microsoft, what, three, four years ago put in their new operating
[1:38:24.240 --> 1:38:28.320]  systems, is the platform for this.
[1:38:28.320 --> 1:38:30.680]  You've got to have an ID to get on.
[1:38:30.680 --> 1:38:32.640]  You can only go to approved sites.
[1:38:32.640 --> 1:38:36.920]  That's what, again, Australia and Italy have already put into place.
[1:38:36.920 --> 1:38:42.640]  Globalists are invoking the threat of cyber attacks by nation states in order to accomplish
[1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:47.320]  their real agenda of stifling and regulating out of existence the last true outpost of
[1:38:47.320 --> 1:38:49.920]  free speech on the internet.
[1:38:49.920 --> 1:38:53.840]  The establishment is furious at the level of influence individuals in small political
[1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:58.440]  groups have been able to wield by means of the World Wide Web, particularly over the
[1:38:58.440 --> 1:39:00.080]  last few years.
[1:39:00.080 --> 1:39:06.080]  Climate Gate is a perfect example of how the power of the digital democracy that authoritarian
[1:39:06.080 --> 1:39:08.040]  enemies of free speech want to cross.
[1:39:08.040 --> 1:39:12.960]  The Copenhagen Global Warming Conference was completely devastating to the Climate Gate
[1:39:12.960 --> 1:39:18.640]  revelations, which appeared just days before elitists convened to ram through their CO2
[1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:19.800]  scam.
[1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:28.040]  As a result of bloggers feverishly pursuing the Climate Gate story, the entire foundation
[1:39:28.040 --> 1:39:33.800]  of the UN's IPCC has been totally eviscerated, and the global warming hoax is on its last
[1:39:33.800 --> 1:39:35.240]  legs.
[1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:38.440]  Most of the mainstream media did a two-week news blackout on this.
[1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:43.540]  It broke actually about a month before Copenhagen started, but the blockade got broken and only
[1:39:43.540 --> 1:39:47.000]  blew up bigger because they covered it up, see.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:50.080]  Before they had that power to block out something.
[1:39:50.080 --> 1:39:51.720]  They can't do it now.
[1:39:51.720 --> 1:39:56.200]  The power to cripple entire branches of their control-free agenda within a matter of weeks
[1:39:56.200 --> 1:40:00.120]  as the globalist hopping man, which is why their mission to eliminate real free speech
[1:40:00.120 --> 1:40:02.200]  on the web is accelerating.
[1:40:02.200 --> 1:40:09.800]  Don't be surprised if it becomes a reality in the near future, writes ZD Nets Doug Hanchard.
[1:40:09.800 --> 1:40:15.120]  See, they tried Cointel Pro and in-fighting and things on the web, but that hasn't worked
[1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:17.120]  for them.
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:23.320]  People just develop a nose for it and learn to discriminate between good and bad.
[1:40:23.320 --> 1:40:28.040]  He said, every device connected to the internet will have a permanent license plate, and without
[1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:31.120]  it, the network won't allow you to log in.
[1:40:31.120 --> 1:40:34.480]  The graphic below illustrates how you would be blocked from using the internet if your
[1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:38.200]  device had not obtained government permission to access the network.
[1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:43.080]  Another method would be used to make the use of fingerprint scanners that are including
[1:40:43.080 --> 1:40:46.920]  and include on a lot of new computer models mandatorily.
[1:40:46.920 --> 1:40:50.640]  You would have to register your fingerprint at a central government data center, and you
[1:40:50.640 --> 1:40:53.960]  notice they're already getting that to get driver's license nationwide and worldwide,
[1:40:53.960 --> 1:40:57.000]  and then scan each time you want to access the internet.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:01.280]  Misbehave online, your access will be denied or they'll blame you.
[1:41:01.280 --> 1:41:02.280]  What is that?
[1:41:02.280 --> 1:41:03.280]  IP spoofing.
[1:41:03.280 --> 1:41:06.640]  You know that happened to us.
[1:41:06.640 --> 1:41:10.640]  One thing for sure concludes Hanchard.
[1:41:10.640 --> 1:41:15.240]  A lot of money is going to be spent trying to sooner or later, everyone may have to pay
[1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:23.680]  with an internet cop instant messaging you, license and registration, please.
[1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:29.080]  It seems certain that cyber security problems will be exploited, just like they staged the
[1:41:29.080 --> 1:41:34.840]  underwear bombing, or even manufactured to justify the move to internet licensing.
[1:41:34.840 --> 1:41:39.600]  Authorities, not public servants, but authorities, are owners, need to create a strong pretext
[1:41:39.600 --> 1:41:46.040]  to justify measures that would otherwise be rightly rejected for what they truly represent.
[1:41:46.040 --> 1:41:49.920]  Government regulation and censorship of the web that would outstrip anything the communist
[1:41:49.920 --> 1:41:54.640]  Chinese have attempted, remember, Microsoft built their grid for them.
[1:41:54.640 --> 1:41:57.960]  Last week Gates was defending the communist Chinese censorship.
[1:41:57.960 --> 1:42:03.200]  Internet censorship bills currently working their way through law in the UK and Australia
[1:42:03.200 --> 1:42:09.760]  and US legislature, legislate for government powers to restrict and filter any website
[1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:14.480]  that it deems to be undesirable for public consumption.
[1:42:14.480 --> 1:42:19.200]  Already on railway systems and government provided networks that the public are paid
[1:42:19.200 --> 1:42:23.520]  for with their tax money, block out prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:27.320]  We've known about that for three years.
[1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:32.160]  In the UK legislation slated as the digital economy bill currently being debated in the
[1:42:32.160 --> 1:42:36.800]  House of Lords would allow the Home Secretary to place a technical obligation on internet
[1:42:36.800 --> 1:42:42.080]  service providers to block whatever sites it wishes, and again, that's what they've
[1:42:42.080 --> 1:42:44.080]  already passed from Australia.
[1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:51.040]  Under clause 11 of the proposed legislation, technical obligation is defined as follows.
[1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:57.320]  A technical obligation in relation to an internet service provider is an obligation for provider
[1:42:57.320 --> 1:43:02.960]  to take a technical measure against particular subscribers to its service.
[1:43:02.960 --> 1:43:05.400]  Same thing with cybersecurity here in the US.
[1:43:05.400 --> 1:43:08.520]  We've had the cybersecurity head come out and say the Pentagon's quote taking over
[1:43:08.520 --> 1:43:09.520]  the web.
[1:43:09.520 --> 1:43:14.240]  He continues, a technical measure is a measure that A, limits the speed and or capacity of
[1:43:14.240 --> 1:43:19.760]  the service provided to the subscriber, B, prevents a subscriber from using the service
[1:43:19.760 --> 1:43:23.680]  to gain access to particular material or limits such use that's already happening through
[1:43:23.680 --> 1:43:31.180]  the private companies, suspends the service provider to a subscriber, or D, limits the
[1:43:31.180 --> 1:43:34.200]  service provided to the subscriber in another way.
[1:43:34.200 --> 1:43:38.560]  In other words, the government will have the power to force ISPs to downgrade and even
[1:43:38.560 --> 1:43:43.160]  block your internet access to certain websites or altogether if it wishes.
[1:43:43.160 --> 1:43:45.520]  So that's the end of net neutrality right there.
[1:43:45.520 --> 1:43:50.120]  The legislation comes in the wake of an amplified UK government efforts to seize more power
[1:43:50.120 --> 1:43:57.640]  of the internet and those who use it for months now, unelected Secretary of State Lord Mandelson
[1:43:57.640 --> 1:44:02.920]  has overseen government efforts to change the independence of the UK's internet infrastructure.
[1:44:02.920 --> 1:44:05.760]  That's a mainstream news headline there that link.
[1:44:05.760 --> 1:44:10.720]  Enemies of free speech again are calling for internet licensing and control.
[1:44:10.720 --> 1:44:15.480]  Mandelson also wants to impose harsh policies via the digital economy bill that would see
[1:44:15.480 --> 1:44:19.360]  users broadband access cut off indefinitely.
[1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:26.120]  In addition to a fine of up to 50,000 pounds or $80,000 without evidence of trial, if they
[1:44:26.120 --> 1:44:30.080]  downloaded copyright music or films, but no trial, they just say it.
[1:44:30.080 --> 1:44:34.160]  The plan has been identified as potentially illegal by experts, remember what came out
[1:44:34.160 --> 1:44:42.320]  three months ago, the secret UN treaty that Obama's already agreed to sign on to that
[1:44:42.320 --> 1:44:47.080]  eviscerates basically any freedom on the web.
[1:44:47.080 --> 1:44:48.640]  It's all happening.
[1:44:48.640 --> 1:44:55.680]  The legislation would impose a duty on ISPs to effectively spy on all customers by keeping
[1:44:55.680 --> 1:45:00.640]  records of those websites they have visited and the material that they have downloaded.
[1:45:00.640 --> 1:45:08.320]  ISPs who refuse to cooperate can be fined a quarter million pounds or $400,000.
[1:45:08.320 --> 1:45:14.880]  A journalist and copyright law expert, Corey Doctrobe, has noted the bill also gives the
[1:45:14.880 --> 1:45:21.800]  secretary of state the power to make up as many new penalties and enforce systems, enforcement
[1:45:21.800 --> 1:45:25.760]  systems as he likes without parliamentary oversight or debate.
[1:45:25.760 --> 1:45:27.400]  It's like the franchise tax in Texas.
[1:45:27.400 --> 1:45:31.960]  It's just they let the comp trailer do whatever they want.
[1:45:31.960 --> 1:45:36.640]  They're now telling us that, well, it's 5% now, but it'll be 8% next year and we'll do
[1:45:36.640 --> 1:45:38.320]  whatever we want.
[1:45:38.320 --> 1:45:43.120]  This could include the authority to appoint private militias and the Pentagon's already
[1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:47.960]  recruiting people on the web for this, who will have the power to kick you off the Internet.
[1:45:47.960 --> 1:45:50.480]  That's what they do in Australia now and Italy.
[1:45:50.480 --> 1:45:53.440]  If someone complains, you just get banned.
[1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:56.760]  Spy on your use of the network, demand the removal of files in addition to the blocking
[1:45:56.760 --> 1:45:58.280]  of websites.
[1:45:58.280 --> 1:46:03.360]  Mandelson and his successors will have the power to invent any penalty, including jail
[1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:09.280]  time for any digital transgression he deems Britons to be guilty of.
[1:46:09.280 --> 1:46:13.800]  Despite being named the digital economy bill, the legislation contains nothing that will
[1:46:13.800 --> 1:46:17.040]  actually stimulate the economy and is largely based on shifting control of the Internet
[1:46:17.040 --> 1:46:21.040]  into government hands, allowing unaccountable bureaucrats to arbitrarily hide information
[1:46:21.040 --> 1:46:25.520]  from the public should they wish to do so.
[1:46:25.520 --> 1:46:29.840]  Mandelson began the onslaught of the free Internet in the UK after spending a luxury
[1:46:29.840 --> 1:46:36.560]  two week holiday at the Nat Rothschild co-firm mansion, the multimillion millionaire record
[1:46:36.560 --> 1:46:39.480]  company executive David Geffen.
[1:46:39.480 --> 1:46:46.160]  The digital economy bill is intrinsically linked to long-term plans by the UK government
[1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:50.160]  to carry out an unprecedented extension of state powers by claiming the authority to
[1:46:50.160 --> 1:46:55.080]  monitor all emails, phone calls, Internet activity nationwide.
[1:46:55.080 --> 1:46:58.760]  Last year the government announced its decision to create a massive central database gathering
[1:46:58.760 --> 1:47:02.960]  details of every text sent, every email, every phone call made, every website visited by
[1:47:02.960 --> 1:47:04.480]  everyone in the UK.
[1:47:04.480 --> 1:47:13.200]  The program known as the Interception Modernization Program would also spy and allow spy chiefs
[1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:19.080]  at the GCHQ, the government secretive e-dropping agency, the Center for Signal Intelligence
[1:47:19.080 --> 1:47:28.600]  sign and end activities to especially place a live tap on every electronic communication
[1:47:28.600 --> 1:47:32.720]  in Britain in the name of perceived terrorism and the same grids being put in here according
[1:47:32.720 --> 1:47:36.400]  to the cyber security chief that stepped down.
[1:47:36.400 --> 1:47:39.880]  Following outcry over the announcement the government suggested last April that it was
[1:47:39.880 --> 1:47:47.560]  scaling down the plans within Home Secretary Jacqueline Smith stating that there was absolutely
[1:47:47.560 --> 1:47:51.280]  no plans for a single center store or communications data.
[1:47:51.280 --> 1:47:55.640]  However, as the clampdown was accelerated by civil liberties advocates and the plan was
[1:47:55.640 --> 1:48:05.160]  replaced by new laws requiring ISPs to store details of emails, Internet telephone information
[1:48:05.160 --> 1:48:08.320]  for just 12 months, fresh details emerged indicating the government was implementing
[1:48:08.320 --> 1:48:14.120]  a Big Brother spy system that far outstrips the original public announcement.
[1:48:14.120 --> 1:48:18.360]  One in times published leaked details of the secret mass Internet surveillance project
[1:48:18.360 --> 1:48:22.080]  known as Mastering the Internet.
[1:48:22.080 --> 1:48:25.800]  Lasting hundreds of millions in public funds, the system is already being implemented by
[1:48:25.800 --> 1:48:33.520]  the GCHQ with the aid of America defense giant Lockheed Martin and British IT firm, DEDICA,
[1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:35.880]  which has closed ties to the intelligence agencies.
[1:48:35.880 --> 1:48:40.920]  A group of over 300 Internet service providers and telecommunications firms has attempted
[1:48:40.920 --> 1:48:46.400]  to fight back over the radical plans describing the proposals as an unwarranted invasion of
[1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:47.640]  people's privacy.
[1:48:47.640 --> 1:48:54.840]  And then it just goes on into what's happening in Australia.
[1:48:54.840 --> 1:48:58.440]  Similar efforts to place restrictions on the Internet are unfolding in Australia where
[1:48:58.440 --> 1:49:04.040]  the government is implementing a mandatory and wide range Internet filtering model on
[1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:05.720]  the communist Chinese government.
[1:49:05.720 --> 1:49:07.800]  They say that.
[1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:11.720]  Australian communications minister Stephen Conroy said the government would be the final
[1:49:11.720 --> 1:49:16.880]  arbiter of what sites would be blacklisted under refused classification.
[1:49:16.880 --> 1:49:21.240]  The order justification for the filter is to block child pornography, but when you actually
[1:49:21.240 --> 1:49:23.240]  read the order, it says political information.
[1:49:23.240 --> 1:49:27.320]  However, as the watchdog group Electronic Frontiers Australia has pointed out, the bill
[1:49:27.320 --> 1:49:31.920]  would also allow the government to block any website it desires while the pornographers
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:36.720]  can relatively easily skirt around the filters.
[1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:38.440]  It just goes on for page after page.
[1:49:38.440 --> 1:49:42.280]  It gets into the really bad stuff at the end.
[1:49:42.280 --> 1:49:46.840]  Earlier this week, the WikiLeaks website published a secret list of sites slated to be blocked
[1:49:46.840 --> 1:49:50.320]  by the Australia state-sponsored partner filter.
[1:49:50.320 --> 1:49:56.160]  The list revealed the blacklisted sites included online poker sites, YouTube links, regular
[1:49:56.160 --> 1:50:03.880]  gay straight porn sites, Wikipedia entries, euthanasia sites, websites of fringe religions,
[1:50:03.880 --> 1:50:08.720]  Christian sites, the website of a tour operator, and even a Queensland dentist.
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:14.160]  The filter will even block web-based games deemed unsuitable for anyone over the age
[1:50:14.160 --> 1:50:17.120]  of 15, according to the Australian government.
[1:50:17.120 --> 1:50:20.400]  The broad attack on the free internet is not only restricted to the UK and Australia, the
[1:50:20.400 --> 1:50:24.760]  European Union, Finland, Denmark, Germany, and other countries in Europe have all proposed
[1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:28.960]  blocking or limiting access to the internet and using filters like those used in Iran,
[1:50:28.960 --> 1:50:31.760]  Syria, China, and other repressive regimes.
[1:50:31.760 --> 1:50:37.040]  In 2008, the motion picture association of America asked President Obama to introduce
[1:50:37.040 --> 1:50:41.760]  laws that would allow the federal government to effectively spy on the entire internet,
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:45.800]  forcing a system whereby being accused of copyright infringement would result in loss
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:48.400]  of your internet connection and the loss of your website.
[1:50:48.400 --> 1:50:53.280]  I'm going to finish up with this because it's so important on the other side.
[1:50:53.280 --> 1:50:56.120]  The empire is striking back and we've got a guest coming up.
[1:50:56.120 --> 1:51:00.200]  I'll get into the stage, underwear bombing, absolutely caught red-handed.
[1:51:00.200 --> 1:51:02.520]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[1:51:02.520 --> 1:51:06.500]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[1:51:06.500 --> 1:51:08.120]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[1:51:08.120 --> 1:51:11.720]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than the
[1:51:11.720 --> 1:51:13.120]  carbon-silver or gold?
[1:51:13.120 --> 1:51:16.400]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and
[1:51:16.400 --> 1:51:18.680]  it's possible that could even happen again.
[1:51:18.680 --> 1:51:23.240]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[1:51:23.240 --> 1:51:24.240]  seeds.
[1:51:24.240 --> 1:51:29.160]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[1:51:29.160 --> 1:51:31.000]  food for you and your family.
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:32.120]  And here's the best part.
[1:51:32.120 --> 1:51:36.320]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds
[1:51:36.320 --> 1:51:38.800]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[1:51:38.800 --> 1:51:42.040]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[1:51:42.040 --> 1:51:48.880]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[1:51:48.880 --> 1:51:53.360]  That's 877-327-0365.
[1:51:53.360 --> 1:51:57.840]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[1:51:57.840 --> 1:52:00.360]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[1:52:00.360 --> 1:52:06.360]  Hello, at ofthefield.com we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[1:52:06.360 --> 1:52:11.280]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on ofthefield.com.
[1:52:11.280 --> 1:52:16.040]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[1:52:16.040 --> 1:52:20.480]  I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf which left me wondering if I even needed
[1:52:20.480 --> 1:52:21.480]  another book.
[1:52:21.480 --> 1:52:22.560]  Boy, was I wrong.
[1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:25.720]  My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of wild foods.
[1:52:25.720 --> 1:52:29.600]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[1:52:29.600 --> 1:52:32.840]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[1:52:32.840 --> 1:52:33.840]  Wow!
[1:52:33.840 --> 1:52:34.840]  I watched the DVD last night.
[1:52:34.840 --> 1:52:36.160]  I was all struck.
[1:52:36.160 --> 1:52:37.880]  What wonderful work you have done.

[1:52:41.720 --> 1:52:42.720]  Thanks again.
[1:52:42.720 --> 1:52:45.560]  Your book has given me the most hope and inspiration.
[1:52:45.560 --> 1:52:46.560]  Thank you.
[1:52:46.560 --> 1:52:49.600]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.

[1:54:10.760 --> 1:54:22.560]  We're going live at PrisonPlanet.tv in the second segment of the next hour.
[1:54:22.560 --> 1:54:31.520]  Mark Moreno of Climate Depot is going to be joining us for about 50 minutes to talk about
[1:54:31.520 --> 1:54:37.940]  how the establishment is trying to run an in-run around Congress and implement their
[1:54:37.940 --> 1:54:44.080]  land grabbing at the county, city and state level.
[1:54:44.080 --> 1:54:46.600]  So they're in trouble, but they're not out of the fight.
[1:54:46.600 --> 1:54:55.400]  Now getting back to internet censorship, they've already built a new internet system and they're
[1:54:55.400 --> 1:54:59.040]  openly saying that they're going to give you no freedom of speech on that.
[1:54:59.040 --> 1:55:07.200]  You will have a subdomain on Yahoo, on Myspace, on Facebook.
[1:55:07.200 --> 1:55:10.760]  And if they don't like you, they will ban you.
[1:55:10.760 --> 1:55:11.760]  There will be taxes.
[1:55:11.760 --> 1:55:12.760]  There will be regulation.
[1:55:12.760 --> 1:55:14.760]  There will be control.
[1:55:14.760 --> 1:55:17.200]  The old web will be incrementally shut down.
[1:55:17.200 --> 1:55:22.760]  If they claim you've had a copyright violation, this is in the new treaty.
[1:55:22.760 --> 1:55:23.880]  You will just be shut down.
[1:55:23.880 --> 1:55:26.560]  Your website gone forever.
[1:55:26.560 --> 1:55:29.560]  It's completely arbitrary.
[1:55:29.560 --> 1:55:31.040]  Then we have Bill Gates.
[1:55:31.040 --> 1:55:32.040]  We have Google.
[1:55:32.040 --> 1:55:35.200]  We have all of them saying they have no problem with what's happening in China.
[1:55:35.200 --> 1:55:38.760]  And then China still started shutting Google out so they had been acting like they're going
[1:55:38.760 --> 1:55:39.760]  to fight back against it.
[1:55:39.760 --> 1:55:45.440]  And Steve Jobs of Apple came out and told the truth over the weekend and said, quote,
[1:55:45.440 --> 1:55:46.440]  don't be evil.
[1:55:46.440 --> 1:55:49.560]  Google slogan is, quote, a joke.
[1:55:49.560 --> 1:55:50.560]  It is.
[1:55:50.560 --> 1:55:53.080]  It's a joke.
[1:55:53.080 --> 1:55:57.880]  It's a joke saying Obama's anti-war or that Obama's standing up against the corrupt banks.
[1:55:57.880 --> 1:56:03.160]  You know, I spent a lot of time just reading the British areas of this article, but it gets
[1:56:03.160 --> 1:56:08.520]  into what's happening here in the U.S. In 2009, the Cybersecurity Act was introduced,
[1:56:08.520 --> 1:56:13.400]  proposing to allow the federal government to tap into any digital aspect of every citizen's
[1:56:13.400 --> 1:56:15.480]  information without a warrant.
[1:56:15.480 --> 1:56:19.360]  Banking business medical records would be wide open to inspection as well as personal
[1:56:19.360 --> 1:56:21.320]  instant messages and email communications.
[1:56:21.320 --> 1:56:24.480]  And they're already just doing it without the law passing, kind of like they can't pass
[1:56:24.480 --> 1:56:27.800]  the greenhouse gas taxes, so they're just doing it.
[1:56:27.800 --> 1:56:32.640]  The legislation introduced by Senator Jay Rockefeller in Olympia Snow in April gives
[1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:36.720]  the president the ability to declare a cybersecurity emergency and shut down or limit traffic on
[1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:42.000]  the Internet in any critical information network in the interest of national security.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:46.240]  The bill does not define a critical information network or cybersecurity emergency.
[1:56:46.240 --> 1:56:49.240]  The definition would be left open to the president, according to Mother Jones.
[1:56:49.240 --> 1:56:54.880]  The president said, well, during a flu crisis, we'd shut down all the web and have all websites
[1:56:54.880 --> 1:56:57.000]  just deliver our government screen.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:00.520]  So all the websites would direct you to whitehouse.gov.
[1:57:00.520 --> 1:57:05.400]  In 96, they put in the EAS, FEMA takeover boxes, and all radio and TV stations.
[1:57:05.400 --> 1:57:08.760]  The final thing your transmitters wired through is their box.
[1:57:08.760 --> 1:57:10.800]  That's all that's happening here.
[1:57:10.800 --> 1:57:15.360]  It's a big deal.
[1:57:15.360 --> 1:57:19.200]  During a hearing on the bill, Senator Jay Rockefeller betrayed the true intent behind
[1:57:19.200 --> 1:57:23.840]  the legislation when he stated, would it be better if we never invented the Internet?
[1:57:23.840 --> 1:57:24.840]  That's a quote.
[1:57:24.840 --> 1:57:27.820]  Well, fear mongering about cyber attacks on U.S. government and how the country could
[1:57:27.820 --> 1:57:28.820]  be shut down.
[1:57:28.820 --> 1:57:30.480]  We have the video clip there.
[1:57:30.480 --> 1:57:37.040]  The Obama White House also sought a private contractor to crawl and archive data such
[1:57:37.040 --> 1:57:41.360]  as comments, taglines, remember the White House saying report stuff that's fishy, people
[1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:43.920]  criticizing the White House.
[1:57:43.920 --> 1:57:48.680]  Obama also proposed scaling back a long-standing ban on tracking how people use government
[1:57:48.680 --> 1:57:49.960]  Internet sites.
[1:57:49.960 --> 1:57:53.400]  Remember when you went to the Cars for Cash for Clunkers program and it told you you're
[1:57:53.400 --> 1:57:57.760]  now on a government site being scanned, being controlled, your computer is now property
[1:57:57.760 --> 1:57:58.760]  of the U.S. government?
[1:57:58.760 --> 1:58:00.680]  That was just a cybersecurity test.
[1:58:00.680 --> 1:58:02.800]  Remember that?
[1:58:02.800 --> 1:58:06.680]  Recent disclosures on the Freedom Information Act also revealed the federal government has
[1:58:06.680 --> 1:58:11.480]  several contracts with social media outlets like YouTube, Google, Facebook, MySpace, Flickr,
[1:58:11.480 --> 1:58:15.800]  Yahoo, that waive rules on monitoring users and permit companies to track visits to government
[1:58:15.800 --> 1:58:17.600]  websites for advertising purposes.
[1:58:17.600 --> 1:58:24.680]  The U.S. military spent $30 billion investment of its own marketing to master Internet projects.
[1:58:24.680 --> 1:58:25.920]  It just goes on and on.
[1:58:25.920 --> 1:58:27.280]  Bottom line, folks.
[1:58:27.280 --> 1:58:30.160]  You better appreciate the free web while it's there.
[1:58:30.160 --> 1:58:33.560]  You better use it to expose these people.
[1:58:33.560 --> 1:58:36.920]  Because the genie's out of the bottle, we need to get the true story of who the enemy
[1:58:36.920 --> 1:58:40.760]  is before they shut the web down.
[1:58:40.760 --> 1:58:46.880]  America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[1:58:46.880 --> 1:58:50.640]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[1:58:50.640 --> 1:58:54.600]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Akola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[1:58:54.600 --> 1:58:57.480]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[1:58:57.480 --> 1:58:58.880]  No, this isn't science fiction.

[1:59:54.000 --> 2:00:05.520]  Preaching war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:05.520 --> 2:00:10.280]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:00:10.280 --> 2:00:11.280]  You want answers?
[2:00:11.280 --> 2:00:13.440]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.440 --> 2:00:17.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:17.600 --> 2:00:26.240]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:26.240 --> 2:00:31.200]  Coming up, how gun confiscation works in Canada, big newspaper reporter had one single
[2:00:31.200 --> 2:00:32.200]  shot shotgun.
[2:00:32.200 --> 2:00:37.720]  He'd registered years ago, they came and confiscated him.
[2:00:37.720 --> 2:00:45.720]  Also, we're going to get into the sharp-dressed man who aided the underwear bomber on Flight
[2:00:45.720 --> 2:00:51.000]  253, was a U.S. government agent, huge news, all the big saber rattling and actual build-up
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  of military forces ahead of an attack on Iran.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:59.440]  That's what they're openly preparing for now, I hope somehow we can stop this, break down
[2:00:59.440 --> 2:01:04.360]  with the aftermath of that attack would look like, the different scenarios.
[2:01:04.360 --> 2:01:07.960]  That is coming up as well today.
[2:01:07.960 --> 2:01:12.600]  We have Mark Moreno joining us from Climate Depot.
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:17.600]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to start simulcasting at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:01:17.600 --> 2:01:23.120]  Now, I'm going to have to go ahead and clear the phone board, or John, you could ask these
[2:01:23.120 --> 2:01:32.120]  callers if they have a climate gate question or a story about all of the land grabbing
[2:01:32.120 --> 2:01:33.640]  that is going on.
[2:01:33.640 --> 2:01:37.680]  We can talk to them about that, but we're going to have calls for our guests, sorry
[2:01:37.680 --> 2:01:47.920]  for those that were holding on the open phones, but I do have to try to now limit that specifically
[2:01:47.920 --> 2:01:52.920]  specifically to callers for our guests that is coming up, because a lot of you are emailing
[2:01:52.920 --> 2:01:56.000]  me saying, hey, we beat Copenhagen, why are you covering this so much?
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:02:02.600]  They're not stopping, they're taking over the cities, they're moving forward against
[2:02:02.600 --> 2:02:03.600]  us.
[2:02:03.600 --> 2:02:07.120]  In fact, Jared, since you're in here, he's about to be with us, my stacks all got moved.
[2:02:07.120 --> 2:02:11.520]  Can you mine into these nine stacks here?
[2:02:11.520 --> 2:02:16.680]  There's a stack with our article, the Bloomberg, the KLBJ, about the $2.6 billion tax in Austin
[2:02:16.680 --> 2:02:17.680]  alone.
[2:02:17.680 --> 2:02:19.680]  Oh, my stack's in there.
[2:02:19.680 --> 2:02:20.680]  Excellent.
[2:02:20.680 --> 2:02:23.600]  I wonder how those got taken out.
[2:02:23.600 --> 2:02:25.960]  Wow, perfect.
[2:02:25.960 --> 2:02:31.400]  Going carbon neutral, Austin Rocks, news radio 590, Austin's carbon reduction plan, more
[2:02:31.400 --> 2:02:33.200]  than cap and trade.
[2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:36.600]  Energy plan comes to city councils, legislature reveals plans.
[2:02:36.600 --> 2:02:37.600]  That's great.
[2:02:37.600 --> 2:02:42.360]  These are great duplicates, but I need the key master article written by Paul Watson
[2:02:42.360 --> 2:02:45.400]  about the scam takeover, focusing on the states.
[2:02:45.400 --> 2:02:51.040]  It'll be in the news and focus right hand side of prisonplanet.com where we post our
[2:02:51.040 --> 2:02:52.040]  top stories.
[2:02:52.040 --> 2:02:53.640]  Thank you, man.
[2:02:53.640 --> 2:02:54.720]  So that is coming up.
[2:02:54.720 --> 2:03:01.200]  I do before we end this segment want to put a plug out.
[2:03:01.200 --> 2:03:04.720]  You get the archives of the radio show and higher quality with audio, you get the video
[2:03:04.720 --> 2:03:08.840]  archives of the radio show where we go live at least the last two hours every day, usually
[2:03:08.840 --> 2:03:11.880]  two or three, sometimes four hours, we do it.
[2:03:11.880 --> 2:03:14.280]  You get all my films of super high quality.
[2:03:14.280 --> 2:03:17.800]  You get extra expanded extras that aren't on the films.
[2:03:17.800 --> 2:03:24.160]  My book, Paul Watson's book, now both out of print, ebooks on prisonplanet.tv, $5.95
[2:03:24.160 --> 2:03:29.880]  a month, or get a yearly membership and get three months free.
[2:03:29.880 --> 2:03:34.680]  And your purchase and support of a prisonplanet.tv membership makes so much of what we do
[2:03:34.680 --> 2:03:35.680]  possible.
[2:03:35.680 --> 2:03:40.400]  We couldn't do it without you, without you.
[2:03:40.400 --> 2:03:45.640]  And so we commend you and we thank all the prisonplanet.tv members, but I want you to
[2:03:45.640 --> 2:03:47.080]  go further.
[2:03:47.080 --> 2:03:49.040]  If you are a member, don't procrastinate.
[2:03:49.040 --> 2:03:52.400]  We've got Divx copies of all my films up there.
[2:03:52.400 --> 2:03:57.200]  You can burn to regular CD that play on almost all new DVD players and computers and it's
[2:03:57.200 --> 2:03:58.200]  pretty good quality.
[2:03:58.200 --> 2:04:02.680]  It's not as good as DVD when you buy the high quality DVDs from us, but it's, it's, it's
[2:04:02.680 --> 2:04:07.360]  a lot better than internet and make copies, give them to people, fall the republic, the

[2:05:00.760 --> 2:05:05.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[2:05:05.400 --> 2:05:09.720]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:05:09.720 --> 2:05:14.040]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[2:05:14.040 --> 2:05:15.360]  allows you to have.
[2:05:15.360 --> 2:05:21.080]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:05:21.080 --> 2:05:25.400]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[2:05:25.400 --> 2:05:29.440]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:05:29.440 --> 2:05:32.920]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[2:05:32.920 --> 2:05:36.640]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[2:05:36.640 --> 2:05:41.320]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:05:41.320 --> 2:05:45.160]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:05:45.160 --> 2:05:46.540]  one of my old sponsors.

[2:05:59.880 --> 2:06:04.160]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[2:06:04.160 --> 2:06:08.520]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[2:06:08.520 --> 2:06:09.520]  do you want?
[2:06:09.520 --> 2:06:11.520]  My answer would be all I can get.
[2:06:11.520 --> 2:06:16.560]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[2:06:16.560 --> 2:06:17.800]  How much do you want?
[2:06:17.800 --> 2:06:18.880]  When do you want it?
[2:06:18.880 --> 2:06:20.800]  Now or after the battle starts.
[2:06:20.800 --> 2:06:21.960]  When will you need it?
[2:06:21.960 --> 2:06:25.400]  When you buy it without proper identification, will there be any food?
[2:06:25.400 --> 2:06:26.880]  Will it make your children sick?
[2:06:26.880 --> 2:06:31.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:32.160]  and be immunized?
[2:06:32.160 --> 2:06:35.960]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:06:35.960 --> 2:06:39.560]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[2:06:39.560 --> 2:06:40.800]  How much will you need?
[2:06:40.800 --> 2:06:41.800]  We don't know.
[2:06:41.800 --> 2:06:42.800]  How much do you want?
[2:06:42.800 --> 2:06:43.800]  All you can get.
[2:06:43.800 --> 2:06:44.800]  I'm Alex Jones.

[2:08:17.440 --> 2:08:22.040]  For the balance of the hour, a man who has a very busy schedule, Mark Moreno, will be
[2:08:22.040 --> 2:08:23.040]  our guest.
[2:08:23.040 --> 2:08:27.480]  He served for three years as Senior Advisor and Speech Researcher and Climate Researcher
[2:08:27.480 --> 2:08:33.720]  for U.S. Senator James Inhofe, Republican Oklahoma, managed the award-winning communications
[2:08:33.720 --> 2:08:38.040]  operations of the GOP side of the EPW Committee.
[2:08:38.040 --> 2:08:41.720]  He joined the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee as the Majority Communications
[2:08:41.720 --> 2:08:43.880]  Director in 2006.
[2:08:43.880 --> 2:08:48.760]  Over a decade, and has worked as a journalist, documentary maker, radio host and national
[2:08:48.760 --> 2:08:54.400]  television correspondent at Climate Depot, it really is the number one website exposing
[2:08:54.400 --> 2:09:00.800]  the attempted takeover of society by big central banks through their rena-mab group of communist
[2:09:00.800 --> 2:09:01.800]  landgrabbers.
[2:09:01.800 --> 2:09:09.080]  Now, I want to look at what happened at Climate Gate and the more than 10 huge scandals that
[2:09:09.080 --> 2:09:14.640]  have come out since then, each one dwarfing and complimenting Climate Gate, systemic total
[2:09:14.640 --> 2:09:19.520]  premeditated fraud, the UN knows man isn't hurting the environment with carbon dioxide,
[2:09:19.520 --> 2:09:23.640]  they want global government, they want global taxes, they've said it.
[2:09:23.640 --> 2:09:27.720]  Now a key article was written at prisonplanet.com on Friday.
[2:09:27.720 --> 2:09:33.320]  I'm asking all listeners to get this out to everybody in your city, your county, because
[2:09:33.320 --> 2:09:38.400]  every major city has these crooks working inside of it, cap-and-trade scam to be enforced
[2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:44.320]  at state level, that's the headline at prisonplanet.com, individuals and businesses in Austin and
[2:09:44.320 --> 2:09:48.440]  the plethora of other states and cities to be taxed for emissions on life-giving gas
[2:09:48.440 --> 2:09:49.440]  carbon dioxide.
[2:09:49.440 --> 2:09:53.960]  Now, don't believe me as we go to Martin Moreno.
[2:09:53.960 --> 2:10:03.320]  Here is solveclimate.com going carbon neutral Austin rocks, and they've got the UN in here
[2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:07.600]  praising Austin as the biggest cuts in North America, worse than what they've already
[2:10:07.600 --> 2:10:09.760]  put in in Canada, okay?
[2:10:09.760 --> 2:10:16.760]  Taxes on natural gas, taxes on gas, fuel, taxes on your home, home inspections, brainwashing
[2:10:16.760 --> 2:10:23.520]  your kids, huge boondoggles like Spain, $700 plus thousand dollars per new green job they
[2:10:23.520 --> 2:10:26.640]  create costing 2.2 jobs.
[2:10:26.640 --> 2:10:31.520]  Here's KLBJ590 linking to the Austin City Council, later if I have time I'll play some
[2:10:31.520 --> 2:10:36.480]  of this video, with the head of Austin Energy saying he wants it, but saying it's good at
[2:10:36.480 --> 2:10:45.360]  $2.6 billion tax in the first three years this is implemented, $2.6 billion on Austin
[2:10:45.360 --> 2:10:50.160]  electricity payers, you cannot make up this level of evil.
[2:10:50.160 --> 2:10:55.200]  Here's another one, energy plan comes to City Council as legislature plans reviews, because
[2:10:55.200 --> 2:10:59.800]  the city can't just do whatever it wants and violates state law, Austin Energy unveils
[2:10:59.800 --> 2:11:05.400]  carbon calculator and expo that Austinites will be forced to use, Austin American statesman.
[2:11:05.400 --> 2:11:10.400]  So I wanted to set that up because, yeah, we beat them at the treaty level, but Gordon
[2:11:10.400 --> 2:11:15.360]  Brown and Obama said, we don't care, we'll just have our EPAs, say it's a toxic waste
[2:11:15.360 --> 2:11:17.040]  and start taxing it.
[2:11:17.040 --> 2:11:22.640]  The UN's here in Austin, they have open meetings with the UN, they're grabbing ranchers and
[2:11:22.640 --> 2:11:28.280]  farmers property with SOS, not letting them build on it using the new London kilo decision,
[2:11:28.280 --> 2:11:33.560]  then later literally former mayors own banks and take control of the property and become
[2:11:33.560 --> 2:11:38.400]  multi-millionaires overnight, I mean it is, I'm living in the Soviet Union, I mean they
[2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:43.440]  are crawling all over us, they hired some special forces, black op commander, the statesman
[2:11:43.440 --> 2:11:48.240]  said to run the program, I mean they got spooks running it, because this is about billions
[2:11:48.240 --> 2:11:53.280]  of dollars per big city, Mark Moreno, thank you for joining us.
[2:11:53.280 --> 2:11:58.360]  Thank you Alex, happy to be here and I think I have a reason why the UN climate panel has
[2:11:58.360 --> 2:12:01.640]  been so inept if you allow me to read a line here.
[2:12:01.640 --> 2:12:02.640]  Sure, go ahead.
[2:12:02.640 --> 2:12:07.680]  The UN was overcome by lust and began to feel Sanji's body caressing her voluptuous
[2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:13.160]  breast, oh I'm sorry, that is what the climate chief of the United Nations has been spending
[2:12:13.160 --> 2:12:18.280]  his spare time writing and that is one of the reasons they've missed all of these basic
[2:12:18.280 --> 2:12:22.400]  scandals that have been boiling right underneath him, he's been writing what the UK papers
[2:12:22.400 --> 2:12:28.560]  are calling a smutty novel, this is Dr. Rajendra Pachari who now UK papers lead authors of
[2:12:28.560 --> 2:12:33.000]  the UN are all asking for his resignation and they are worried because the people who
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:38.640]  you just mentioned some of this globalist agenda, the global governance agenda, having
[2:12:38.640 --> 2:12:43.040]  these scandals come out on the heels of climate cave, these are all new scandals by the way
[2:12:43.040 --> 2:12:48.240]  is going to destroy their international agenda, it's going to destroy the domestic agenda
[2:12:48.240 --> 2:12:52.640]  and this is what they've been plotting for for decades, this was a poker game, they did
[2:12:52.640 --> 2:12:56.640]  all in, all their chips were in, they forgot, every other environmentalist who rode this
[2:12:56.640 --> 2:13:02.640]  one out to achieve sort of a status control and global governance and now they're being
[2:13:02.640 --> 2:13:07.440]  forced to bail out and they are not liking this and the head of the UN is spending his
[2:13:07.440 --> 2:13:12.640]  time writing smutty sex novels and by the way it gets creepier, the head of the UN climate
[2:13:12.640 --> 2:13:18.440]  panel, Rajendra Pachari, who by the way I debated in 2006 in Kenya and I called the UN an echo
[2:13:18.440 --> 2:13:19.440]  chamber and he was-
[2:13:19.440 --> 2:13:22.960]  For those that don't know, he looks like some of Bin Laden's older brother.
[2:13:22.960 --> 2:13:30.000]  Well, here's the deal, this book he wrote, Alex, is about a man in his late 60s climate
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:34.440]  expert betting a bunch of young women and that's exactly what Pachari is so now we may
[2:13:34.440 --> 2:13:38.680]  have a hint at what he did with his Nobel Prize winning prestige that he shared with
[2:13:38.680 --> 2:13:44.960]  Al Gore when the award, by the way, Australian papers, others are now calling for rescinding
[2:13:44.960 --> 2:13:50.160]  the Nobel Peace Prize, the Nobel award to this UN climate panel and this is just, it
[2:13:50.160 --> 2:13:51.160]  just grows-
[2:13:51.160 --> 2:13:59.520]  Well, Mark, I want to go over Pachari Gate, Santa Gate, Glacier Gate, Rainforest Gate,
[2:13:59.520 --> 2:14:06.240]  we have just tons of new emails, the fake temperature readings, I mean literally scandal
[2:14:06.240 --> 2:14:13.360]  after scandal, red-handed fraud as of course you have the oil for food scammer now hiding
[2:14:13.360 --> 2:14:19.600]  in China from indictment, we have Maury Strong openly saying they want to destroy industrialized
[2:14:19.600 --> 2:14:26.560]  society, they want to destroy the middle class, I mean, is this the beginning of a full route?
[2:14:26.560 --> 2:14:31.600]  Let's go over all the scandals but then get into the empire striking back, they are still
[2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:33.080]  taking over the cities.
[2:14:33.080 --> 2:14:38.680]  I mean, they are, I mean that's the thing, there's a built-in inertia, like an energy,
[2:14:38.680 --> 2:14:43.520]  even after something's dead, there can still be an energy for it, the chicken still runs
[2:14:43.520 --> 2:14:48.480]  around immediately after its head's cut off and so what's happened is they've had decades
[2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:53.520]  to lay the landmines, to lay the traps, to lay the strategy and they have everything from
[2:14:53.520 --> 2:14:59.240]  endangered species acts, to Supreme Court rulings, to the EPA declaring CO2, we exhale from
[2:14:59.240 --> 2:15:02.880]  our own mouth, essentially declaring human beings toxic, they have a favorable ruling
[2:15:02.880 --> 2:15:07.440]  there where the EPA could regulate it, they have all sorts of international treaties they
[2:15:07.440 --> 2:15:13.600]  can do, they have now Obama setting up a carbon registry in America and of course they have
[2:15:13.600 --> 2:15:17.800]  the climate bill lying in wait, they have host, host and you were mentioning or alluding
[2:15:17.800 --> 2:15:22.600]  to some all across whether it's the state of California, whether it's cities, regulations
[2:15:22.600 --> 2:15:27.720]  coming out of our ears and we have the stoppage of coal plants and carbon-based energy, the
[2:15:27.720 --> 2:15:34.440]  most obscene thing, Alex, that has happened here is President Barack Obama, a man of color,
[2:15:34.440 --> 2:15:38.600]  I need to say that to remind your listeners because apparently people like Chris Matthews,
[2:15:38.600 --> 2:15:43.400]  you know, that's all they see but I assume most people aren't like Chris Matthews who
[2:15:43.400 --> 2:15:47.480]  we have to forget, you know, Obama gives a great speech, suddenly he forgets he's black
[2:15:47.480 --> 2:15:52.200]  and he might think he's white for a moment but what Obama has done, most shocking, he's
[2:15:52.200 --> 2:15:58.200]  now supporting limiting development in the poverty stricken third world, Obama's administration
[2:15:58.200 --> 2:16:01.920]  is telling the World Bank, not that we're any fans necessarily of the World Bank, but
[2:16:01.920 --> 2:16:07.200]  don't fund coal-fired plants in developing countries due to global warming fears.
[2:16:07.200 --> 2:16:12.720]  In other words, what little good any international body could ever have would be to help infrastructure
[2:16:12.720 --> 2:16:20.120]  and to help bring running water, electricity to people living at the bare level of necessities
[2:16:20.120 --> 2:16:24.880]  to bring modern civilization, President Obama, and this is condemning the majority of people
[2:16:24.880 --> 2:16:30.600]  of color, 1.6 billion people, he's condemning people of color to a continued life of backbreaking
[2:16:30.600 --> 2:16:31.600]  poverty.
[2:16:31.600 --> 2:16:37.960]  And by the way, Mark, you're not just saying that, they fooled the third world to sign
[2:16:37.960 --> 2:16:43.040]  that onto the treaty saying we're going to tax America and Europe and England and Australia
[2:16:43.040 --> 2:16:47.040]  and give you the money, then they actually got the Copenhagen Treaty, then it said they
[2:16:47.040 --> 2:16:52.960]  had to make right at double the cuts, it was just shy of double the cuts we do, every major
[2:16:52.960 --> 2:16:58.880]  statistician who studied this says it would make tens of millions more on top of the 15
[2:16:58.880 --> 2:17:03.240]  million kids that starved to death each year, starved to death, if you industrialize the
[2:17:03.240 --> 2:17:08.880]  third world, every study shows they will then stop having as many children like Japan, the
[2:17:08.880 --> 2:17:14.680]  US, England, and everybody else is done and in fact start having negative overall population
[2:17:14.680 --> 2:17:19.080]  growth, the US has a negative growth except for those moving in, they know all of this,
[2:17:19.080 --> 2:17:25.880]  it's a pure tool of control and it's a death sentence, meanwhile, China builds three new
[2:17:25.880 --> 2:17:30.720]  giant coal powered plants a week, we're not building any new ones for those that are being
[2:17:30.720 --> 2:17:36.960]  shut down. The farce on China, and you'll hear the left, whether it's New York Times,
[2:17:36.960 --> 2:17:41.880]  Tom Friedman, they'll be gloating about China, how they don't have all the democracy restrictions
[2:17:41.880 --> 2:17:46.080]  that we do, and how we're going to be left behind because they're investing all this
[2:17:46.080 --> 2:17:49.920]  and the new green technologies and wind and solar and they're going to be advanced and
[2:17:49.920 --> 2:17:54.920]  we're going to leave us in the dust, my response to that is if China wants to piss away all
[2:17:54.920 --> 2:18:00.560]  their money on failed alternative energy technology, years before it's ever ready that for mass
[2:18:00.560 --> 2:18:03.280]  production, let them, doesn't mean we need to follow that.
[2:18:03.280 --> 2:18:08.880]  But they're not doing it, they built a few, they built a few railroads, they're actually
[2:18:08.880 --> 2:18:13.800]  going with all the old technology. They are, but they have a front up where they're investing
[2:18:13.800 --> 2:18:19.120]  in alternative energies and everyone's saying, oh we need to be more like China. We had Tom
[2:18:19.120 --> 2:18:23.840]  Friedman actually lamenting that the US and democracies couldn't do with China, that
[2:18:23.840 --> 2:18:28.160]  he's looking for a benevolent dictator, essentially, the New York Times columnist, because he
[2:18:28.160 --> 2:18:31.280]  went to get these things rammed through, the democratic-
[2:18:31.280 --> 2:18:37.480]  Mark, you just hit on something. The Chinese called for a global one-child policy at Copenhagen.
[2:18:37.480 --> 2:18:43.000]  Every global policy report I read, like this book, Ecoscience, by John P. Holdren, White
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:48.640]  House Science, says we need a police state like China to carry out forced sterilization.
[2:18:48.640 --> 2:18:55.920]  Well, yeah, I mean, they are enamored with it, but it gets worse. NASA's, lead scientists,
[2:18:55.920 --> 2:18:59.840]  you probably covered this on your program. James Hansen has now endorsed a book which
[2:18:59.840 --> 2:19:05.080]  calls for, quote, ridding the world of industrial civilization. And I'm not making this up.
[2:19:05.080 --> 2:19:09.760]  That's what I, that climate depot I put, is it time for medicine, medicine for James Hansen.
[2:19:09.760 --> 2:19:14.240]  But that's what they all say. That's what Pichari says, it's what Maury Strong say.
[2:19:14.240 --> 2:19:18.600]  That's almost a complete, I read his quote in his book, that is almost word for word
[2:19:18.600 --> 2:19:23.360]  what Maury Strong says. Yeah, and not only that, but even Pichari, you mentioned, he's
[2:19:23.360 --> 2:19:27.720]  at the point now where they're talking about a level of global governance where you're
[2:19:27.720 --> 2:19:31.440]  not going to be able to have ice water in restaurants. I mean, you have the head of
[2:19:31.440 --> 2:19:36.840]  the UN chief writing smutty novels at the same time, telling the Western world that
[2:19:36.840 --> 2:19:40.720]  they can't have ice water in restaurants because we had to save the planet. Meanwhile,
[2:19:40.720 --> 2:19:45.720]  he's telling the news services that he lives at 30,000 feet. He has a car and driver chauffuring
[2:19:45.720 --> 2:19:51.800]  them the one, one, one mile. Stay there, Mark. Stay there, Mark. Folks, this is the ultimate

[2:21:01.120 --> 2:21:05.520]  Originally we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency to ensure
[2:21:05.520 --> 2:21:11.280]  purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[2:21:11.280 --> 2:21:16.200]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system. Wisdom being
[2:21:16.200 --> 2:21:21.280]  lost with time. The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with
[2:21:21.280 --> 2:21:26.920]  private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[2:21:26.920 --> 2:21:30.880]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our
[2:21:30.880 --> 2:21:35.240]  elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original
[2:21:35.240 --> 2:21:39.560]  value. Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world
[2:21:39.560 --> 2:21:44.120]  reserve currency. Hi this is Ted Anderson. I'm offering a book that explains how the
[2:21:44.120 --> 2:21:51.240]  system works. Call me today at 800-686-2237. I will give you a silver dollar free just

[2:22:02.680 --> 2:22:07.240]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[2:22:07.240 --> 2:22:12.720]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug
[2:22:12.720 --> 2:22:17.520]  from underneath the Americans at home. I have turned an innocent influence on our president
[2:22:17.520 --> 2:22:22.760]  in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of
[2:22:22.760 --> 2:22:28.280]  us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the republic identifies the enemies
[2:22:28.280 --> 2:22:33.840]  of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[2:22:33.840 --> 2:22:38.480]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[2:22:38.480 --> 2:22:42.600]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to?
[2:22:42.600 --> 2:22:48.440]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall

[2:24:09.440 --> 2:24:14.400]  Every move they make, every word they say, we're watching them improving their fraud.
[2:24:14.400 --> 2:24:18.960]  Mark Moreno, climatedepot.com is our guest. We're going to open the phones up for our
[2:24:18.960 --> 2:24:22.760]  guest, your questions, one of the leading experts on these criminals and how to fight
[2:24:22.760 --> 2:24:29.640]  them. 1-800-259-9231. Mark, this is a short segment so I want you to be able to run through
[2:24:29.640 --> 2:24:34.480]  all the new scandals. Then let's get into the fact that it's not just a chicken with
[2:24:34.480 --> 2:24:39.880]  their head cut off. I guess it's partially cut off. I mean 2.6 billion in taxes in three
[2:24:39.880 --> 2:24:45.920]  years in Austin. They're not stopping. They're just going around the Senate. They're using
[2:24:45.920 --> 2:24:48.360]  the EPA. They're not stopping.
[2:24:48.360 --> 2:24:55.640]  Yeah, it's a very good point. Perhaps I am too much of a cheerleader for the death of
[2:24:55.640 --> 2:25:00.240]  this. I'm actually just about to post a climate depot with a shot of a casket with roses being
[2:25:00.240 --> 2:25:05.440]  thrown on. The problem is you're making a very good point. Liberalism doesn't die when
[2:25:05.440 --> 2:25:09.840]  you chop a head off. It's going to come back. It's like a hydra. All these multiple heads
[2:25:09.840 --> 2:25:15.320]  and limbs just keep coming back. But I think what's going to happen is the global warming
[2:25:15.320 --> 2:25:18.760]  movement, as we know it, is that I actually did a piece about two or three weeks ago
[2:25:18.760 --> 2:25:24.120]  now about time for the next eco-scare. They're already test marketing the next eco-scare.
[2:25:24.120 --> 2:25:28.640]  The UN chief himself, when he's not writing smart, is actually saying that there's a larger
[2:25:28.640 --> 2:25:33.160]  problem in global warming and that's sustainable development. Al Gore's producer, Laurie David,
[2:25:33.160 --> 2:25:43.760]  is worried about plastic waste. The UK Green Party is out worried about the whole new eco-thing
[2:25:43.760 --> 2:25:49.240]  about oxygen. The man-made emissions are creating an oxygen crisis. They're saying it's more
[2:25:49.240 --> 2:25:53.000]  alarming than global warming. We have people worried about nitrous oxide, otherwise known
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:58.680]  as laughing gas, which is again used in fertilizing, which is part of our agricultural production.
[2:25:58.680 --> 2:26:05.880]  It's all based on, all these new eco-scars are based on limiting human freedom, limiting
[2:26:05.880 --> 2:26:10.440]  human development, and controlling population, and giving government more power in order
[2:26:10.440 --> 2:26:15.840]  to, quote, save us. I think global warming may be damaged beyond repair in terms of an
[2:26:15.840 --> 2:26:21.840]  issue to sell. We have Democratic agricultural chairman, Peterson, now came out and admitted
[2:26:21.840 --> 2:26:25.600]  that he will now vote no on the climate bill if it comes back up because he went back home
[2:26:25.600 --> 2:26:29.920]  and was laughed at and ridiculed and mocked. It's become politically untenable, but you're
[2:26:29.920 --> 2:26:33.800]  right. There's so many regulations in place that it has to be fought, but I think the
[2:26:33.800 --> 2:26:37.280]  danger is going to be the next eco-scare when it comes out.
[2:26:37.280 --> 2:26:42.120]  Well, wait a minute, Mark, a year ago. You were actually talking about other scares,
[2:26:42.120 --> 2:26:46.080]  and now we have to move from global warming, and this wasn't right, but there's going
[2:26:46.080 --> 2:26:50.080]  to be something down the road, but there's going to be a leftover. I think we can actually
[2:26:50.080 --> 2:26:53.680]  defeat this now. It is mortally wounded if not dead.
[2:26:53.680 --> 2:26:58.280]  Well, I agree with you if we press the issue, but there was a New York Times article almost
[2:26:58.280 --> 2:27:05.080]  a year ago, back in February of 2009, and it talked about the PR firms with the Wine
[2:27:05.080 --> 2:27:11.680]  House already saying we've got to move away from saying warming to change any changes
[2:27:11.680 --> 2:27:17.720]  abnormal, basically the seasons, and that the ocean is turning to acid, and that the
[2:27:17.720 --> 2:27:24.100]  key term are deteriorating atmosphere. And so they already were starting to hedge their
[2:27:24.100 --> 2:27:26.680]  bet and move to a new fraud a year ago.
[2:27:26.680 --> 2:27:31.560]  And they were, and they have been. In fact, you have UN scientists, Professor Lateef,
[2:27:31.560 --> 2:27:35.840]  managing the specter of possible global cooling for decades. Your peer-reviewed study saying
[2:27:35.840 --> 2:27:41.720]  no warming for three decades, a new peer-reviewed study came out the end of December last year,
[2:27:41.720 --> 2:27:47.280]  warning of 50 years of global cooling. What they've found, it's just untenable to say
[2:27:47.280 --> 2:27:52.760]  CO2 drives temperature, period. There's hundreds, thousands of factors influencing the global
[2:27:52.760 --> 2:27:57.160]  climate. CO2 is but a trace of essential gas in the atmosphere. It could never have
[2:27:57.160 --> 2:28:02.400]  had the properties or abilities that they claimed it did. And now even the warmest, or admitting
[2:28:02.400 --> 2:28:07.760]  this, a new study by, over the lead UN author, Susan Solomon, is showing that water vapor
[2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:11.440]  may have actually suppressed temperatures over the last decade. They're all scratching
[2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:15.800]  their heads. The model didn't predict it. They never foresaw this. Yet Susan Solomon
[2:28:15.800 --> 2:28:20.120]  is out there telling people that we need to think of CO2, something we exhale from our
[2:28:20.120 --> 2:28:22.440]  mouth akin to nuclear waste.
[2:28:22.440 --> 2:28:27.200]  Gradually, when kids used to go to school, they learned that CO2 was vital in photosynthesis,
[2:28:27.200 --> 2:28:30.920]  that it's a trace of essential gas, and that it greens the planet Earth. Now they're being
[2:28:30.920 --> 2:28:36.400]  told it's nuclear waste. And that is a perversion of science. Same thing's happening in Africa,
[2:28:36.400 --> 2:28:43.480]  by the way. There are multiple African environmental activists blaming young girls turning to prostitution
[2:28:43.480 --> 2:28:48.160]  on man-made global warming. So imagine you have a generation of Africans being raised
[2:28:48.160 --> 2:28:52.560]  that anything bad that happens to them, drought, floods, hurricanes, your daughter becomes a
[2:28:52.560 --> 2:28:55.600]  hooker, is because of the West's wealth and their emissions.
[2:28:55.600 --> 2:28:56.600]  I saw that, Mark.
[2:28:56.600 --> 2:28:59.600]  It's a perversion of science, Alex, and they're being exposed right now.
[2:28:59.600 --> 2:29:04.600]  But it's even worse than that. First, it was Danny Glover saying Haiti happened because
[2:29:04.600 --> 2:29:08.120]  of global warming. Then last week, I saw the UN saying it.
[2:29:08.120 --> 2:29:12.560]  Yeah, I mean, they've tried it. That's why the leading scientists are now calling it
[2:29:12.560 --> 2:29:18.280]  climate astrology. Whether the ice caps warm, melt, expand, freeze, whether you have floods,
[2:29:18.280 --> 2:29:22.440]  droughts, hurricanes, whether you have record cold, blizzards, everything's consistent with
[2:29:22.440 --> 2:29:27.040]  global warming. You can't falsify the theory. Hence, it's become no more scientific than
[2:29:27.040 --> 2:29:32.320]  your daily horoscope in the newspaper. It is a joke. It is a laughing stock. At my website
[2:29:32.320 --> 2:29:37.400]  today, I have this Indian magazine that has a headline, We've Been Had Global Warming
[2:29:37.400 --> 2:29:40.640]  the Quote Hotest Hoax in the World, A Pack of Lies.
[2:29:40.640 --> 2:29:45.600]  Stay there. Stay there. We're going to come right back long segment to talk about how we
[2:29:45.600 --> 2:29:50.640]  fight this because they're not going away. They're not backing off Martin Moreno, ClimateDepot.com.
[2:29:50.640 --> 2:30:00.760]  I'm Alex Jones. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:00.760 --> 2:30:05.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[2:30:05.400 --> 2:30:09.920]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number
[2:30:09.920 --> 2:30:14.400]  two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[2:30:14.400 --> 2:30:20.000]  you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[2:30:20.000 --> 2:30:25.400]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[2:30:25.400 --> 2:30:30.440]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[2:30:30.440 --> 2:30:34.640]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their
[2:30:34.640 --> 2:30:39.280]  power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful
[2:30:39.280 --> 2:30:43.440]  backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[2:30:43.440 --> 2:30:47.760]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information

[2:31:00.080 --> 2:31:06.400]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones. I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[2:31:06.400 --> 2:31:11.080]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[2:31:11.080 --> 2:31:16.200]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system
[2:31:16.200 --> 2:31:21.200]  is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator
[2:31:21.200 --> 2:31:27.680]  infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the
[2:31:27.680 --> 2:31:33.160]  silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation threatening the

[2:32:01.640 --> 2:32:06.640]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[2:32:06.640 --> 2:32:12.120]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug
[2:32:12.120 --> 2:32:16.920]  from underneath the Americans at home. We have tremendous influence on our president
[2:32:16.920 --> 2:32:21.920]  and Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all
[2:32:21.920 --> 2:32:27.680]  of us as American citizens to pay attention. For all of the republic identifies the enemies
[2:32:27.680 --> 2:32:33.240]  of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[2:32:33.240 --> 2:32:37.880]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're
[2:32:37.880 --> 2:32:42.000]  asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:47.880]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[2:32:47.880 --> 2:32:54.160]  of the republic. Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're

[2:32:59.160 --> 2:33:22.560]  Folks, in-game blueprint for global enslavement has their quotes, how they want to destroy
[2:33:22.560 --> 2:33:28.040]  industrialized society, how they want to bring in, quote, a Chinese-style police state that
[2:33:28.040 --> 2:33:33.880]  forced one-child policies, forced abortions, forced sterilization, how the environmental
[2:33:33.880 --> 2:33:40.120]  movement is nothing but a death cult, a bunch of sicko, human-hating parasites who want
[2:33:40.120 --> 2:33:44.560]  to be able to organize and control our society, selectively decide who can have businesses,
[2:33:44.560 --> 2:33:50.640]  who can have factories, who can have jobs. This is big government's takeover. And where
[2:33:50.640 --> 2:33:57.800]  I live they're taking over. Home inspections, 2.6 billion in taxes. It is so insane and
[2:33:57.800 --> 2:34:03.920]  so illegal. Get in-game at infowars.com today. Make copies of it. I made this film three
[2:34:03.920 --> 2:34:09.320]  years ago. And so when I hear about another UN chief in his own book and NASA chiefs and
[2:34:09.320 --> 2:34:15.400]  others, you know, saying we need to destroy industrialized society, they don't really
[2:34:15.400 --> 2:34:19.640]  want to destroy it. They want to own it and control it and shut down their competition.
[2:34:19.640 --> 2:34:23.840]  They're monopoly men. Now, going back to Mark Moreno of Climate Depot, Mark, you're one
[2:34:23.840 --> 2:34:27.600]  of the leading experts out there. You've been fighting this for decades, but I'm going to
[2:34:27.600 --> 2:34:32.560]  tell you a point blank. You keep saying they're idiots. They're fools. They're always caught
[2:34:32.560 --> 2:34:37.720]  being wrong. If you read all the emails and Bill Santor and all of them, they admit that
[2:34:37.720 --> 2:34:42.480]  it was made up. They know it's a joke. The club of Rome knows it's a joke. They want
[2:34:42.480 --> 2:34:47.120]  to teach humans to be guilty, that we're bad, so the mother government can run our lives.
[2:34:47.120 --> 2:34:51.760]  I mean, sure, their followers are a bunch of well-meaning idiots who are wrong and it's
[2:34:51.760 --> 2:34:58.320]  like astrology, but for the leadership, there's nothing to do with, with, with mumbo jumbo.
[2:34:58.320 --> 2:35:00.760]  They know it's a fraud. I mean, do you agree with that statement?
[2:35:00.760 --> 2:35:05.680]  Oh, absolutely. I mean, they knew this. This was a just house of cards from the very beginning
[2:35:05.680 --> 2:35:11.600]  in 1988. When they came out with this, the UN got involved. It was a political organization
[2:35:11.600 --> 2:35:16.720]  masquerading as a scientific organization. As early as 1996, you mentioned Ben Santor.
[2:35:16.720 --> 2:35:23.440]  They were altering the document, violating their own internal rules to put in key phrases
[2:35:23.440 --> 2:35:28.840]  saying that mankind is responsible for global warming. They did whatever it took, and then
[2:35:28.840 --> 2:35:34.240]  they invented the hockey stick. They actually had scientists conspiring behind the scenes
[2:35:34.240 --> 2:35:37.880]  that we had to, quote, get rid of the medieval warm period, unquote, because you couldn't
[2:35:37.880 --> 2:35:42.520]  explain unprecedented warmth when the medieval warm period was clearly warmer than today
[2:35:42.520 --> 2:35:46.560]  when we didn't have SUVs. So they got rid of the medieval warm period, and then they
[2:35:46.560 --> 2:35:50.880]  went through, and then even when that was debunked, they quietly, essentially downplayed
[2:35:50.880 --> 2:35:55.800]  it or almost removed it from the 2007 UN report, showing that there was no medieval warm period
[2:35:55.800 --> 2:35:59.920]  that we were unprecedented. But essentially, if you go back to Timothy Worth, the former
[2:35:59.920 --> 2:36:04.480]  senator from Colorado, he said, even if we're wrong on the science, we're doing right by
[2:36:04.480 --> 2:36:09.360]  policy. So you know from the beginning, and that was back in 1988 when the UN was founded,
[2:36:09.360 --> 2:36:13.200]  the UN climate panel was founded, you know from the beginning that it was never about
[2:36:13.200 --> 2:36:18.360]  the science. It was all about trying to scare people to whatever means possible to get the
[2:36:18.360 --> 2:36:23.440]  policy objectives they wanted done. And the policy objectives have been the same, whether
[2:36:23.440 --> 2:36:26.800]  it's global cooling, manmade global cooling in the 70s. They thought our emissions were
[2:36:26.800 --> 2:36:30.600]  causing global dimming and that's, you know, cooling the earth. And we had Newsweek actually
[2:36:30.600 --> 2:36:35.080]  saying climatologists were pessimistic that we could act fast enough, you know, to stave
[2:36:35.080 --> 2:36:39.960]  off disaster. They were warning of floods, droughts. It's literally plug and play. Whatever
[2:36:39.960 --> 2:36:45.320]  eco catastrophe of the day, it's always the same. All of this is going to be floods, droughts,
[2:36:45.320 --> 2:36:48.320]  severe storms. We're going to have worse hurricanes. It's going to be horrible.
[2:36:48.320 --> 2:36:52.440]  And by the way, Mark, by the way, you're not even pressing the issue. I mean, it's worse
[2:36:52.440 --> 2:36:57.960]  than what you're even saying, because you're in a hurry here. Pichari comes out last week
[2:36:57.960 --> 2:37:02.400]  and says, yeah, we put out fake data. I read his quote on air. I'm paraphrasing it now.
[2:37:02.400 --> 2:37:09.240]  Yeah, we put out some fake data on the Himalayas based on a cell phone call and a graduate paper.
[2:37:09.240 --> 2:37:15.280]  Some student wrote a mountaineer student. But you know what? We wanted to scare people
[2:37:15.280 --> 2:37:18.520]  so that they would do something because we want to save you. And I can't tell you how
[2:37:18.520 --> 2:37:23.320]  many reporters have sat across from me and said, okay, it's a fraud, but don't we need
[2:37:23.320 --> 2:37:29.560]  to get away from oil? Isn't it all that's kind of like Dan rather, if you remember the National
[2:37:29.560 --> 2:37:34.160]  Guard documents in George Bush? Oh, yeah, sure. The documents are fraud, but the information
[2:37:34.160 --> 2:37:38.400]  was probably true. So what's the big deal? Who cares if it was a fake document? It must
[2:37:38.400 --> 2:37:42.000]  be true because we all believe it. And that's what you found in the climate gate emails.
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:46.680]  They were actually talking about, I can't prove it, but the medieval warm period must
[2:37:46.680 --> 2:37:50.760]  not have been as cold as today, must not have been as warm as today. They said they made
[2:37:50.760 --> 2:37:55.000]  it happen. They couldn't prove it scientifically, but in their gut, they knew they had to produce
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:37:58.800]  it. But take center. I mean, he was interviewed by Jesse Ventura. That's when that finally
[2:37:58.800 --> 2:38:03.160]  broke. We'd always known it. He said, yeah, we took out five scientists in our own report
[2:38:03.160 --> 2:38:09.640]  in 96 that told the UN man is not causing warming and he just admits it. I mean, that's
[2:38:09.640 --> 2:38:15.240]  as big as climate gate right there. And, uh, you know, so it's not a mistake. It's not
[2:38:15.240 --> 2:38:20.100]  just some data that was separate. They altered. I mean, now it's come out with the thermostats
[2:38:20.100 --> 2:38:25.760]  all over the world. The UN document came out two months ago. Yeah. Joe DeLeo meteorologist
[2:38:25.760 --> 2:38:29.880]  from the weather channel, American meteorological society and Anthony Watts from what's up with
[2:38:29.880 --> 2:38:36.560]  that, a website have shown that the US government to use a kind word is massaging the temperature
[2:38:36.560 --> 2:38:42.440]  data that we're warming bias to use other words. I mean, this is outright data manipulation
[2:38:42.440 --> 2:38:47.560]  all for a political end. And it's being done coordinated that you and document two months
[2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:53.240]  ago, how they over a decade ago coordinated with major universities. Yeah. And that's
[2:38:53.240 --> 2:38:59.000]  the thing. This has been from the beginning. It's been an agenda driven science. They had
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:02.600]  to come up. They actually meet and they'll actually get together. We had John Christie,
[2:39:02.600 --> 2:39:08.440]  a UN scientist who said he was at the last, I think it was a 2001 UN climate report. And
[2:39:08.440 --> 2:39:12.920]  he said that all the UN lead authors are sitting around the table conspiring how to make the
[2:39:12.920 --> 2:39:18.440]  report so alarming that the US would have to endorse the UN Kyoto climate treaty. This
[2:39:18.440 --> 2:39:22.920]  isn't science. And that we were fed hook, line, and thicker with the media that this
[2:39:22.920 --> 2:39:28.120]  was somehow a scientific process. This was the gold standard process. This was a fraud
[2:39:28.120 --> 2:39:32.760]  and other Princeton physicists just came out and said, climate gate reveals it as fraud,
[2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:37.160]  pure and simple. And that's what's on my headline up here now. It's fraud. The headline is the
[2:39:37.160 --> 2:39:42.120]  climate change fraud from this Indian newspaper around the world. People are catching on and
[2:39:42.120 --> 2:39:46.680]  people are getting angry. You mentioned the Himalayan thing. Well, the scientists responsible
[2:39:46.680 --> 2:39:51.240]  for having that information in there that was completely unvetted, wild information
[2:39:51.240 --> 2:39:56.120]  that it was going to melt in a few decades, which is laughable, admitted that it was left
[2:39:56.120 --> 2:40:01.720]  in there because they wanted to pressure policymakers to act on global warming.
[2:40:01.720 --> 2:40:06.360]  That's scientific fraud. In a previous day, we would have trials. People would be losing
[2:40:06.360 --> 2:40:10.920]  their jobs, their tenure, their professorship. It would be public scandal. And we're still
[2:40:10.920 --> 2:40:16.200]  not at that point. The US media completely ignored this. The UK media deserves medals
[2:40:16.200 --> 2:40:20.360]  right now and the Indian media deserves medals. But the mainstream media in the US
[2:40:20.360 --> 2:40:23.960]  is almost complete. They have done a few climate gate stories. And kudos to Katie
[2:40:23.960 --> 2:40:28.840]  Kirk, whoever thought we would be saying that. She's actually done at least two good reports
[2:40:29.560 --> 2:40:34.520]  on this issue. But that's because it's imploding on them. And now they understand that they're
[2:40:34.520 --> 2:40:38.760]  being fully discredited. So they're desperate. And that signals that it really is in deep
[2:40:38.760 --> 2:40:42.520]  trouble because they're doing this, but shifting gears, Mark. And then I want to go to calls.
[2:40:43.080 --> 2:40:49.400]  Shifting gears here. If you have tens of billions of dollars in Europe, in the US,
[2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:55.400]  given the universities, given to the UN, given to organizations in fraud, you have them lying
[2:40:55.400 --> 2:41:01.960]  and scaring people to get money to then push an agenda. Is this not racketeering? Is it not fraud?
[2:41:01.960 --> 2:41:07.960]  Is it not criminal? What is the state of criminal investigations? And can we have that?
[2:41:07.960 --> 2:41:13.560]  Because in England, they have appointed a leading pro manmade global warming fearmonger
[2:41:13.560 --> 2:41:16.840]  as the quote independent head of the whitewash commission.
[2:41:16.840 --> 2:41:21.880]  Yeah, not only in England, but at Penn State University, it's a bunch of, from the reports
[2:41:21.880 --> 2:41:25.560]  I'm seeing, it's a bunch of people who are either alumni or tied with the university,
[2:41:25.560 --> 2:41:29.240]  who aren't going to want the university tied to scandal, and then investigation of Michael
[2:41:29.240 --> 2:41:35.880]  hockey stick man. So that's a problem because you can't have, you know, you can't have a university
[2:41:35.880 --> 2:41:41.400]  investigate itself, but you can't have a fellow traveler, if you will, investigate another fellow
[2:41:41.400 --> 2:41:44.680]  traveler. It's just, you're not going to get, I think that's why I think these investigations
[2:41:44.680 --> 2:41:48.520]  are ultimately meaningless. This is in the battle of public opinion, Alex.
[2:41:48.520 --> 2:41:53.800]  And at the October of last year, Halloween, more Americans believed in haunted houses
[2:41:53.800 --> 2:41:59.320]  than manmade global warming. So we are winning. And from the state houses to the cities, to the
[2:41:59.320 --> 2:42:03.720]  Congress, they are being mocked and ridiculed now. And I just think it's going to be harder
[2:42:03.720 --> 2:42:08.280]  and harder for anyone to enact this because global warming, the entire movement has been
[2:42:08.280 --> 2:42:13.960]  exposed as fraudulent from the UN down. You even have New York Times reporter Andrew Rebskin
[2:42:13.960 --> 2:42:17.480]  backing away saying, well, there's other organizations now besides the United Nations,
[2:42:17.480 --> 2:42:22.040]  whoever said the UN, the UN was touted as the gold standard. And now people are saying, well,
[2:42:22.040 --> 2:42:25.560]  it was never that big part. Well, they were organizing and running the fraud, but again,
[2:42:25.560 --> 2:42:32.600]  shifting gears here. If you go back five, six, seven years ago, you and many others are being
[2:42:32.600 --> 2:42:38.920]  attacked by these different fraudulent scientists. There's talk of arresting climate deniers,
[2:42:38.920 --> 2:42:45.000]  treason charges for Lord Monkton. Now you've been vindicated in a royal flush. You're not just in
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:52.440]  spades. If they were freaking out and panicking six, seven years ago, we now learn, I wonder what
[2:42:52.440 --> 2:42:58.520]  the internal state of these crooks is right now. Well, it's interesting. I mean, right now, you
[2:42:58.520 --> 2:43:03.560]  have the lead scientist of the UN turning on the Pichari. Now, keep in mind, Pichari, the head,
[2:43:03.560 --> 2:43:09.800]  you know, for your audience to remember, the smut peddler, was the Nobel Prize winner,
[2:43:09.800 --> 2:43:16.600]  the media darling for years. And he, his entire identity is this job. In fact, this Indian magazine,
[2:43:16.600 --> 2:43:21.960]  which is where Pichari's from, says, quote, Pichari, his degree in training is in railroad
[2:43:21.960 --> 2:43:27.160]  engineering. This man was educated to make railroads run from point A to B. I cannot see
[2:43:27.160 --> 2:43:31.320]  him voluntarily resigning. He's going to have to be forced out. But what they're going to do,
[2:43:31.320 --> 2:43:35.880]  they're already talking about a new organization. They're talking about moving it over to the EU.
[2:43:35.880 --> 2:43:39.960]  They're basically going to acknowledge that the climate panel is deeply flawed. Pichari's going
[2:43:39.960 --> 2:43:44.040]  to probably be booted out. And they're going to turn this over to some other international body,
[2:43:44.040 --> 2:43:50.200]  probably the economic form or, you know, some branch of the EU and Europe. And then they're
[2:43:50.200 --> 2:43:54.600]  going to try to go forward. They're going to institute a whole series of high-minded reforms.
[2:43:54.600 --> 2:43:58.280]  But guess what? Beneath it, it's probably going to be the same core scientist. What
[2:43:58.280 --> 2:44:02.520]  this really exposed, and the reason I've been putting pictures of the Wizard of Oz about that
[2:44:02.520 --> 2:44:09.080]  climate depot, is this was probably only 40 to 50, 60 scientists at the core of it. There's only 52,
[2:44:09.080 --> 2:44:13.960]  53 scientists who authored the media summary for policymakers. Those were the core activists.
[2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:20.280]  Of that, only 60 scientists signed off on the idea that man-made emissions cause global warming.
[2:44:20.280 --> 2:44:27.240]  Well, since those reports have come out, there's been an abundance of studies throwing cold water
[2:44:27.240 --> 2:44:32.040]  all over it. And you and scientists now eating crow talking about water vapor, talking about
[2:44:32.040 --> 2:44:38.040]  coming global cooling predictions. So the movement has to reinvent itself in some way. But what I'm
[2:44:38.040 --> 2:44:43.640]  going to say is, I think it's mortally wounded. I think they're going to find a new eco-scare.
[2:44:43.640 --> 2:44:48.040]  I think they're going to have at least some hybrid of this. Well, what they're doing in
[2:44:48.040 --> 2:44:53.640]  Austin and other cities is they just call it jobs creation and green jobs. And so we're going to
[2:44:53.640 --> 2:44:58.840]  put a big tax on you. And the whole pretext was over the man-made global warming, but now they're
[2:44:58.840 --> 2:45:03.640]  just not using that term. But going back, and then we're going to phone calls,
[2:45:03.640 --> 2:45:12.360]  a Marmarano climate depot right now as our guest, looking at this, they don't care. Obama doesn't
[2:45:12.360 --> 2:45:17.000]  care. He says he's going to have the EPA go ahead and implement it. Europe is doing this.
[2:45:17.000 --> 2:45:25.080]  Gordon Brown said they're going to have the IMF and World Bank start collecting the climate data,
[2:45:25.080 --> 2:45:31.080]  the carbon footprint data. The cities are already doing it. So don't we need Congress
[2:45:31.720 --> 2:45:37.720]  to have hearings and drag the oil company CEOs who've been supporting this, Dutch Royal Shell BP,
[2:45:37.720 --> 2:45:43.320]  to drag Al Gore in who's making money off the windmill companies and off of the carbon trading.
[2:45:43.320 --> 2:45:49.320]  Don't we need to have criminal investigation hearings to put these guys up on the stand
[2:45:49.320 --> 2:45:55.640]  and show them for the crooks they are? Wouldn't that be the true death blow and really finger them
[2:45:55.640 --> 2:45:59.400]  for the crooks they are? Well, Alex, here's the problem with that. I agree. I mean, you have,
[2:45:59.400 --> 2:46:06.200]  this is essentially huge elements if not outright racketeering. You have Al Gore lobbying Congress
[2:46:06.200 --> 2:46:10.360]  for a cap and trade carbon trading bill. At the same time, he's working with a firm called
[2:46:10.360 --> 2:46:16.040]  Kleiner Perkins in the Chicago Stock Exchange to put in $1 billion in 40 different companies.
[2:46:16.040 --> 2:46:20.760]  And keep in mind, this billion-dollar investment in these carbon trading companies is worthless
[2:46:20.760 --> 2:46:26.440]  unless Congress passes a mandate. So Al Gore's got a personal financial interest. Congress would
[2:46:26.440 --> 2:46:32.520]  go nuts if this were, you know, the bankers, it would go nuts if this were auto executives,
[2:46:32.520 --> 2:46:37.160]  but because they're greenies, they're left alone. But here's the scary part. You would think that
[2:46:37.160 --> 2:46:41.400]  Wall Street would have been dragged in and prosecuted. I mean, a few people went down,
[2:46:41.400 --> 2:46:45.160]  but what was Congress' reaction to the scandal on Wall Street?
[2:46:45.160 --> 2:46:50.840]  Bailout. The biggest thing we have to fear in the throes of victory here is that the Congress
[2:46:50.840 --> 2:46:55.080]  may come out and bail out the global warming movement. And I'm not sure exactly what form
[2:46:55.080 --> 2:46:58.440]  that could take, but there's going to be- They're going to do it at the city level.
[2:46:58.440 --> 2:47:00.520]  They're going to do it at the collapse of the carbon market. So you don't know that
[2:47:01.800 --> 2:47:05.400]  the perversion, the way these things work, when you leave suspected, they're going to end up
[2:47:05.400 --> 2:47:09.080]  getting propped up somehow. Well, Mark, here's how they're propping them up. And I mean,
[2:47:09.080 --> 2:47:13.720]  I've been watching them closely. Schwarzenegger said this the last day of Copenhagen with Governor
[2:47:13.720 --> 2:47:18.680]  and Mayor's Conference. They're going with the EPA at the federal level because they can't get
[2:47:18.680 --> 2:47:25.640]  the Senate to do it. Basically, strong arm the cities into doing it, and the cities will fund
[2:47:25.640 --> 2:47:29.800]  these private companies. And that's where the big fight is. Let's go to some phone calls.
[2:47:29.800 --> 2:47:35.800]  Laura in Texas, you're on the air with Mark Moreno. Go ahead. Hello, Alex. So I remember
[2:47:35.800 --> 2:47:42.520]  when you'd say, you know, once they lie, they have to lie again and again. Oh, this is Blake
[2:47:42.520 --> 2:47:48.520]  and Lies and Rolling Stone magazine saying, you idiots, eat the planet's worst enemies.
[2:47:49.720 --> 2:47:54.680]  Yeah, it came out January 21st, 2010. And it's absolutely ridiculous.
[2:47:54.680 --> 2:48:01.080]  Yeah, this is just, that's just sort of the bathroom humor for Rolling Stone.
[2:48:01.080 --> 2:48:05.800]  They did, I think it was 16 profiles. I was number six on the list of the climate idiot
[2:48:05.800 --> 2:48:11.240]  that called climate killers. You know, Rolling Stone is just a pure entertainment. It's
[2:48:11.240 --> 2:48:15.080]  something you keep on your coffee table and laugh. But the fact is, the fact that they're
[2:48:15.080 --> 2:48:19.000]  doing an issue like that shows they know that they're gooses. Well, they can't do this anymore.
[2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:23.800]  I mean, they sit up there as the big mommy, the big daddy, and they tell us what's real,
[2:48:23.800 --> 2:48:27.560]  and they tell us what isn't. They're discredited. It doesn't work anymore.
[2:48:27.560 --> 2:48:31.560]  When the mainstream media writes hit pieces about me, we only get more listeners,
[2:48:31.560 --> 2:48:37.320]  because 90% of the public goes, Alex Jones or Mark Moreno must be good if the mainstream
[2:48:37.320 --> 2:48:42.280]  media is going after him. Exactly. I mean, it's a badge of honor. Absolutely. In fact,
[2:48:43.240 --> 2:48:47.400]  when you look across what happened the last year as this started collapsing,
[2:48:47.400 --> 2:48:53.480]  talking points memo, a big talking point for MSNBC and the talk radio of the left,
[2:48:53.480 --> 2:48:59.240]  they had a big post saying, isn't it time to start executing global warming skeptics?
[2:48:59.240 --> 2:49:04.120]  And then we had a Gryff magazine a few years back calling for Nuremberg style trials for
[2:49:04.120 --> 2:49:08.360]  skeptics of global warming. They call them deniers to bring up the Holocaust. So,
[2:49:08.360 --> 2:49:15.240]  you know a movement is corrupt and fraudulent when not only will the leader, Al Gore, did not debate
[2:49:15.240 --> 2:49:20.200]  and the UN will not allow any dissension, but when they start threatening and intimidation,
[2:49:20.200 --> 2:49:25.160]  and that's again what climate gate revealed, they redefined peer review. They corrupted
[2:49:25.160 --> 2:49:29.640]  this. This is a group of crooks. And again, thank God they've been exposed. I just don't,
[2:49:29.640 --> 2:49:35.160]  I don't know how any politician in America could vote for a global warming bill in any state,
[2:49:35.160 --> 2:49:38.840]  even in Massachusetts at this point. We had Scott. I hear you. Let's jam in another call.
[2:49:38.840 --> 2:49:41.880]  Thanks, Laura. Great point. Pete in Michigan, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:49:42.760 --> 2:49:48.600]  Hi, Alex. I got a couple of questions for the guy sitting there with you and I wanted to tell
[2:49:48.600 --> 2:49:54.760]  you. Mark Moreno, climatedepot.com. Go ahead. Okay. Real quick, I just wanted to say I'm like
[2:49:54.760 --> 2:49:59.000]  some of the websites and different things people are saying that there's going to be solar flares
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:04.680]  in 2012 and total destruction of the earth. Well, that's NASA saying mega flare to hit the earth
[2:50:04.680 --> 2:50:09.720]  then. And I assure you your SUV has nothing to do with it. Yeah. Well, they're saying that the
[2:50:09.720 --> 2:50:14.760]  government's going into these bunkers. Well, that kind of conflicts with things. Why would they rob
[2:50:14.760 --> 2:50:20.360]  us blind if we're all going to be dead anyways? But the question for your climate guy is I was
[2:50:20.360 --> 2:50:26.280]  wondering, I had a theory, you know, I know climate, the heat rising and all that's a bunch of crap.
[2:50:26.280 --> 2:50:32.600]  But is it possible that us as humans using up all of our different resources here on earth,
[2:50:32.600 --> 2:50:39.640]  that we are altering the density of the earth plus or minus thus changing the orbit of the earth
[2:50:39.640 --> 2:50:44.520]  because of its effect? We're going to come back and get the time. I've asked scientists about this.
[2:50:44.520 --> 2:50:50.040]  The amount of human activity is negligible compared to other natural processes like
[2:50:50.040 --> 2:50:54.520]  volcanoes and other things. But we'll get Mark Moreno's take on that. But don't worry if you pay
[2:50:54.520 --> 2:50:59.800]  a tax to Al Gore, you buy an indulgence, a carbon indulgence from him like you'd buy from the Pope
[2:50:59.800 --> 2:51:04.920]  500 years ago. Men, are you thinking about the health of your prostate? Recently, new vitality

[2:52:06.040 --> 2:52:10.760]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[2:52:10.760 --> 2:52:14.280]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[2:52:14.280 --> 2:52:20.520]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[2:52:20.520 --> 2:52:25.800]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:52:25.800 --> 2:52:31.240]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal off-short cartel,
[2:52:31.240 --> 2:52:35.880]  hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:52:35.880 --> 2:52:40.440]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[2:52:40.440 --> 2:52:44.280]  saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care.
[2:52:44.280 --> 2:52:49.480]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[2:54:06.280 --> 2:54:11.320]  You heard Martin Moreno quote the NASA scientist about how we've got to destroy industrial society.
[2:54:12.120 --> 2:54:16.200]  This is the rewilding project. It's the UN. It's the end game.
[2:54:17.800 --> 2:54:22.200]  Mark, what about that question about humans mining things and then destabilizing the earth?
[2:54:22.200 --> 2:54:29.400]  Go ahead. Exactly what you just said, Alex. First of all, the earth is a majority ocean for
[2:54:29.400 --> 2:54:33.880]  number one and for human activity to do the data study about five or six years ago,
[2:54:33.880 --> 2:54:39.240]  even on a land-based thing, the earth was still 40 or more percent and total wilderness
[2:54:39.880 --> 2:54:43.640]  of all surface, the land-based surface activity, I believe, on the earth.
[2:54:43.640 --> 2:54:47.880]  So it's not people have this image that we've literally paved the entire earth. That's not the
[2:54:47.880 --> 2:54:52.200]  case. And I don't think there's any way we could affect the wobble. I have not seen any studies
[2:54:52.200 --> 2:54:57.640]  on that. That sounds like a wild speculation. Let's go to John in West Virginia. You're on
[2:54:57.640 --> 2:55:06.360]  the air. Go ahead. Hey, hello. Go ahead, sir. Oh, yeah. So I was just at work the other day.
[2:55:07.240 --> 2:55:12.600]  There were really nice people came in and he was a science teacher at a local high school
[2:55:12.600 --> 2:55:18.520]  and I asked him, well, they teach about this kids in school about global warming. He said,
[2:55:18.520 --> 2:55:22.920]  well, not really much, but, you know, he said he had a buddy that actually worked with the
[2:55:22.920 --> 2:55:27.400]  university. It took course samples and this and that. And I asked him, I said, he said it was
[2:55:27.400 --> 2:55:31.960]  kind of, he said it was shrinking, but not much. And I said, well, what time of the year was it
[2:55:31.960 --> 2:55:35.800]  when they did it? And he kind of looked at me funny. And then I asked him if he heard about
[2:55:35.800 --> 2:55:41.880]  all the emails from the IPCC, discredited and, you know, how did the data, you know,
[2:55:41.880 --> 2:55:47.400]  discredit scientists and he said, you know, he was unaware and I said, well, you can, you know,
[2:55:47.400 --> 2:55:53.080]  get on YouTube or Google it. And there's all kinds of, you know, news coverage about it.
[2:55:54.920 --> 2:55:59.880]  John, I appreciate your call. We got to move quick. Another example of the almost complete
[2:55:59.880 --> 2:56:05.240]  media blackout so far here in the US. Yeah, it really is. And they won't be able to get away
[2:56:05.240 --> 2:56:09.560]  with that for long. Again, people listen to talk radio, people read the internet,
[2:56:09.560 --> 2:56:14.360]  people are reading opinion columns, people, or some of the cable news is covering this,
[2:56:14.360 --> 2:56:16.920]  not much. So even Fox News is not been covering these.
[2:56:16.920 --> 2:56:19.640]  Why aren't Republicans having hearings about this?
[2:56:20.360 --> 2:56:23.880]  I don't know. It's a very good question. This should be, I mean, this is,
[2:56:23.880 --> 2:56:28.840]  you know, with the health effects, this because the UN IPCC climate panel has not been discredited,
[2:56:28.840 --> 2:56:35.720]  the EPA basis for declaring CO2 a pollutant is now completely bogus because it relies heavily
[2:56:35.720 --> 2:56:41.400]  on the UN IPCC scientist science, which has now been discredited. So there needs to be a lawsuit
[2:56:41.400 --> 2:56:45.000]  going at the heart of that. And there had, there have been some congressmen involved in that and,
[2:56:46.200 --> 2:56:49.960]  talking about a lawsuit against that, but you're right. This should be front and center.
[2:56:49.960 --> 2:56:53.720]  We need to kill it now while the momentum there, we can't let them regroup,
[2:56:53.720 --> 2:56:57.320]  institute a bunch of silly reforms. This is the key to their whole program.
[2:56:57.320 --> 2:57:00.760]  One more call. DJ in Illinois, you're on the air with Mark Moreno. Go ahead.
[2:57:00.760 --> 2:57:06.440]  Mark, I'm glad to hear you. I think that they are making a very critical move,
[2:57:06.440 --> 2:57:11.640]  a very strategic move, and it has been done so quietly. Most of folks don't even know what's
[2:57:11.640 --> 2:57:19.240]  going on. It is called the Upper Mississippi River International Port District Act in Illinois.
[2:57:19.240 --> 2:57:22.920]  Look at Illinois. Yeah, that's like NAFTA superhighways. These internet,
[2:57:22.920 --> 2:57:27.080]  80 plus percent of our ports are now far and run. Mark Moreno, comments on that.
[2:57:27.080 --> 2:57:31.400]  Well, that's all part of the, you know, the globalist agenda. And, you know,
[2:57:31.400 --> 2:57:35.640]  if people just need to step back, people praising China, people thinking that a global government
[2:57:35.640 --> 2:57:39.800]  can bring, and just remember that throughout history, government have been the most violent
[2:57:39.800 --> 2:57:45.160]  institution, barred none. And anyone who wants, you know, and the bigger the government,
[2:57:45.160 --> 2:57:50.440]  the more repressive and the less easy to control. So when you get to a level where you're talking
[2:57:50.440 --> 2:57:56.200]  about, you know, either the EU or global UN controlling carbon, something we have to help
[2:57:56.200 --> 2:58:00.440]  in our mouth, down to the level where they're telling us what kind of toilet paper we can use,
[2:58:00.440 --> 2:58:04.120]  what kind of shower head. We're talking about international body. We have a German climate
[2:58:04.120 --> 2:58:07.960]  advisor calling for a CO2 budget for every man, woman, and child on the planet.
[2:58:07.960 --> 2:58:10.280]  Oh, the British are calling for your carbon ration.
[2:58:10.280 --> 2:58:12.440]  It's everything. That's the game right there.
[2:58:12.440 --> 2:58:16.200]  They're calling for the carbon rations. DJ, I'm sorry we're out of time. That was a great point
[2:58:16.840 --> 2:58:22.280]  you brought up. I mean, these people are control freaks. And national sovereignty is a firewall
[2:58:22.280 --> 2:58:25.800]  against tyranny. Imagine if there had been a global government and Hitler would have taken
[2:58:25.800 --> 2:58:32.840]  it over Stalin. ClimateDepot.com, our website's infowars.com. Mark, keep it up. We appreciate you.
[2:58:32.840 --> 2:58:37.640]  Call for Congress to have hearings on this, my friend. All right. Thank you very much, Alex.
[2:58:37.640 --> 2:58:41.240]  You know, this is far from over, but it is joyful to watch this collapse at the moment.

[3:00:32.120 --> 3:00:37.640]  Thank you so much for joining us. I want to have Neil and Al and a few others on the whole climate
[3:00:37.640 --> 3:00:43.080]  situation be able to continue to comment. They were taking over the locals, the federals, and at
[3:00:43.080 --> 3:00:49.320]  the international level with their total control of our lives. They're still having the executive
[3:00:49.320 --> 3:00:55.240]  branch in Europe, in England, the U.S., Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and other nations, Japan do
[3:00:55.240 --> 3:01:02.360]  it. They don't care what the diet says in Japan. They don't care what the parliament says in England.
[3:01:02.360 --> 3:01:08.680]  They don't care what the U.S. Senate says here in the U.S. They don't care. They're not stopping.
[3:01:08.680 --> 3:01:14.440]  They don't care. Yes, we have the tools to expose the frauds. Yes, it's all a lie.
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:22.280]  Yes, they want to destroy industrial civilization. These are hardcore villains. They exist. They're
[3:01:22.280 --> 3:01:27.720]  real. They're on record. Now coming up, I want to get into the Iran situation.
[3:01:27.720 --> 3:01:35.480]  I want to get into the latest with Kurt Haskell and what happened. Their sharp-dressed man who
[3:01:35.480 --> 3:01:40.680]  aided underwear bomber on the Flight 253 was U.S. government agent. I want to go over that,
[3:01:40.680 --> 3:01:45.800]  but right now let's go back to some of the phone calls. Let's talk to Al in Florida. Al,
[3:01:45.800 --> 3:01:51.960]  you're on the air. Hello, Mr. Jones. I have two questions for you. The first one is,
[3:01:51.960 --> 3:02:01.480]  do you know what a floral carbon footprint is? Yes. What's a floral carbon footprint?
[3:02:02.760 --> 3:02:08.760]  They're talking about a spectrum of gasses that they believe contribute to man-made global warming.
[3:02:10.120 --> 3:02:16.120]  And that's the footprint, carbon footprint, right? That's a spectrum term I've seen them use.
[3:02:16.120 --> 3:02:25.560]  Yeah, because I've got a bill on my door from the Florida Energy Conservation Advisors
[3:02:26.120 --> 3:02:32.040]  providing free home energy conservation and energy waste and floral carbon footprint.
[3:02:32.040 --> 3:02:36.120]  They want to know how many adults in the home, children, your name, telephone.
[3:02:36.120 --> 3:02:39.000]  Yeah, what they're doing is without the enabling legislation,
[3:02:39.560 --> 3:02:45.320]  and some states have already passed it as law, they put smart thermostats in and they say they're
[3:02:45.320 --> 3:02:49.720]  going to turn your thermostat on or off. They're going to decide how hot or cold your house is.
[3:02:49.720 --> 3:02:54.600]  That's mainstream news. Austin is getting these stinking things. Our office got one about four
[3:02:54.600 --> 3:02:59.240]  months ago. They don't ask. They come and put it on outside so the government could turn my heat
[3:02:59.240 --> 3:03:05.000]  down or up or whatever they wanted to do. And Austin wants to make you have audits to be able
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:09.800]  to sell your house, and then they can raise the level of the audit over the years like the income
[3:03:09.800 --> 3:03:17.640]  tax started out at 1%, and now it's 40%. So, yes, that's these home inspections.
[3:03:18.680 --> 3:03:23.640]  It's the same thing with the animal ID, premises ID. It's not law, it's a regulation,
[3:03:23.640 --> 3:03:27.320]  but when you fill that form out, you waive all your rights on your property.
[3:03:28.600 --> 3:03:36.280]  And my second question is this. The eugenicists, these elitists, these people who want to control
[3:03:36.280 --> 3:03:48.360]  population and be beyond one child population, but eliminate 80% of us, is it the great persecution
[3:03:48.360 --> 3:03:54.600]  that John in Revelation talked about in the Bible? The greatest persecution mankind has
[3:03:54.600 --> 3:04:01.880]  ever seen, that God himself has to put an end to it, or no life would be left. Is that the same thing?
[3:04:01.880 --> 3:04:06.120]  It sure fits the bill, doesn't it? It sure do.
[3:04:08.760 --> 3:04:13.800]  I appreciate your call, Al. Cass, John, Jarrah, others, we're going to get to your calls, but

[3:05:21.640 --> 3:05:26.200]  you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it
[3:05:26.200 --> 3:05:30.600]  make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the
[3:05:30.600 --> 3:05:36.280]  gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.

[3:07:54.120 --> 3:08:03.480]  or call 800-540-EXAM. That's 800-540-3926. The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[3:08:03.480 --> 3:08:09.000]  probably presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[3:08:15.000 --> 3:08:22.760]  We are back live. South Africa, Israel, Japan, they've all developed nuclear weapons.
[3:08:22.760 --> 3:08:28.280]  Iran has been overthrown several times by the British and the U.S. in the last century alone.
[3:08:30.280 --> 3:08:37.320]  Bush put out a White House press release in 2007 admitting that four different terrorist
[3:08:37.320 --> 3:08:42.360]  organizations, three of them Al Qaeda run. Remember, that's who fights the Iranians,
[3:08:43.560 --> 3:08:48.440]  who are Shiite, is the Al Qaeda back groups out of Saudi Arabia,
[3:08:48.440 --> 3:08:52.760]  but they were trying to destabilize the country. They've been conducting terror bombings, trying
[3:08:52.760 --> 3:08:58.600]  to get riots going. Again, I'm no fan of what the Iranian regime does. I'm against big government.
[3:08:59.480 --> 3:09:06.760]  I know historically that 99% of the time government is bad. Government is out of control.
[3:09:07.640 --> 3:09:15.000]  Government is wrong. Government is abusive. The bigger the government, the more abusive it is.
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:22.760]  But the facts are Iran is not expanding. Iran is not attacking anybody. They do
[3:09:22.760 --> 3:09:29.480]  fund some groups in Lebanon. They tend to have tit for tat responses with Israel. They're not
[3:09:29.480 --> 3:09:33.640]  friends with Israel. They have said they want to destroy the regime that's there.
[3:09:34.280 --> 3:09:37.400]  And then that's misquoted as saying they want to kill everybody that's there.
[3:09:37.400 --> 3:09:42.680]  But the point is, if we attack Iran, they're going to shut the Strait of Hormuz.
[3:09:42.680 --> 3:09:46.280]  They're going to fire their tens of thousands of sunburned missiles at our fleets.
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:53.400]  They are going to spill over into Iraq. They have a defense pact with Russia and China.
[3:09:53.960 --> 3:10:00.840]  And they've got 66 million people, not 23 million. And they are statistically,
[3:10:00.840 --> 3:10:05.800]  historically a lot better military power than Iraq. And it is going to be hellish.
[3:10:06.600 --> 3:10:11.480]  All because the globalists want to start a new war as a political distraction and link up with
[3:10:11.480 --> 3:10:18.360]  Iraq they control, with Georgia they can control, going from the west to the east, Georgia, Turkey,
[3:10:19.160 --> 3:10:25.480]  Iraq. Then you've got Pakistan, Afghanistan at the U.S. is in. They want Iran to link up
[3:10:26.280 --> 3:10:33.080]  for empire impacts Americana in that part of the world. Oil prices will conservatively
[3:10:33.080 --> 3:10:38.840]  triple. That's most estimates are even higher. They're talking about $500 a barrel oil, not 70.
[3:10:38.840 --> 3:10:47.000]  So that's more than a quadripling. The list goes on and on and on. What will happen?
[3:10:47.640 --> 3:10:54.280]  What will develop? What will unfold if that takes place? And you see the underwear bombing,
[3:10:54.280 --> 3:11:00.040]  clearly a staged event. You see the fear mongering associated with that.
[3:11:01.160 --> 3:11:04.920]  You see the naked body scanners going in. You see the White House and speeches saying,
[3:11:04.920 --> 3:11:11.800]  get ready for Al Qaeda to hit us. Obama signing a police state martial law executive order
[3:11:11.800 --> 3:11:18.280]  dealing with biological attack. They're clearly engaged in a prefectory phase to get the people
[3:11:18.280 --> 3:11:25.400]  ready for a supposed terror attack against U.S. interest or in the U.S. or against the British
[3:11:25.400 --> 3:11:29.640]  as a pretext to go in. Remember the White House memo. Remember Downing Street memos.
[3:11:30.760 --> 3:11:34.840]  This was in the times of London. The White House admitted that they told Tony Blair we want to
[3:11:34.840 --> 3:11:39.880]  get a U.S. aircraft flying low shot down to blame it on Iraq. That they knew there were no doubly
[3:11:39.880 --> 3:11:48.280]  MDs. Governor Ridge admits they created fake terror alerts for political gain. This is what they do
[3:11:48.280 --> 3:11:54.760]  and they do this over and over and over again. So it's important for people to read all the
[3:11:54.760 --> 3:12:01.400]  mainstream news articles. I'll get a document cam from prisonplanet.tv viewers here. The type of hype
[3:12:01.400 --> 3:12:08.680]  that's going on and not just hype or saber rattling, the actual military buildup in and around that
[3:12:08.680 --> 3:12:16.520]  area that is accelerating. China, Iran spur U.S. to develop anti-sea battle plan. This military
[3:12:16.520 --> 3:12:20.520]  is drawing up a new air sea battle plan in response to threats such as China's persistent
[3:12:20.520 --> 3:12:24.600]  military buildup in Iran's possession of advanced weapons. According to the Pentagon's latest
[3:12:24.600 --> 3:12:28.920]  strategy review, the Air Force and Navy are seeking more effective ways of ensuring continued
[3:12:28.920 --> 3:12:34.840]  access to Western Pacific and to counter potential threats to American bases and personnel.
[3:12:38.040 --> 3:12:44.440]  Continuing, U.S. raises stakes in Iran by sending ships and missiles. London Guardian
[3:12:44.440 --> 3:12:50.360]  Pentagon says Patriot shield will deter strike on American allies in the Gulf. Now remember three
[3:12:50.360 --> 3:12:56.440]  years ago, the Pentagon released their attack plan, two different plans. One was three months,
[3:12:56.440 --> 3:13:02.360]  thousands of sorties that is fighter bomber missions, blowing up their entire infrastructure,
[3:13:02.360 --> 3:13:10.360]  power plants, water plants, military bases, seaports, roads, bridges, television, media,
[3:13:10.360 --> 3:13:18.120]  government, infrastructure, just absolute crime against humanity leveling Iran. Iran will launch
[3:13:18.120 --> 3:13:22.680]  real terror attacks all over the world. The government will then use those attacks to take
[3:13:22.680 --> 3:13:28.680]  citizens rights. We're the real target of Homeland Security in Northcombe. You won't have to have
[3:13:28.680 --> 3:13:34.920]  staged terror attacks because terror in many cases is anybody resisting. If a cop tries to break
[3:13:34.920 --> 3:13:39.160]  your head open with a billy club and you raise your arm to block it and they break your arm,
[3:13:39.160 --> 3:13:44.600]  they charge you with assault. You've seen that on the news how many times. Well, if Iran raises its
[3:13:44.600 --> 3:13:55.160]  arm to block a blow from a billy club, that will be called terrorism. Okay? So this is the type
[3:13:55.160 --> 3:14:02.600]  of situation that we are talking about here. And so these defensive systems are not defensive.
[3:14:02.600 --> 3:14:08.120]  That's so if Iran fires its 12,000 or whatever the newest number is, sunburned missiles that go a
[3:14:08.120 --> 3:14:15.320]  couple of hundred miles at the fleet. Remember, they tried to order Fox Fallon to they had a
[3:14:15.320 --> 3:14:20.760]  sent com to put the fleet within range of those. He refused. Then they had the stage deal where
[3:14:20.760 --> 3:14:25.720]  they had Navy SEALs saying where Iranians were going to blow you up. Then later it came out that
[3:14:25.720 --> 3:14:33.480]  had been staged. Fox Fallon said, I'm not going to be part of this and resign. So they clearly
[3:14:33.480 --> 3:14:41.320]  want to start this up. A Patriot missile systems are being put in tensions between the US and Iran
[3:14:41.320 --> 3:14:45.320]  height and dramatically today with the disclosure that Barack Obama is deploying a missile shield
[3:14:45.320 --> 3:14:49.880]  to protect American allies in the Gulf from attack by Tehran. They do that before the war.
[3:14:50.760 --> 3:14:57.960]  They did it in 1991, 1991, did it in 2002, 2003. The US is dispatching Patriot defense
[3:14:57.960 --> 3:15:03.080]  missiles to four countries, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait and keeping two
[3:15:03.080 --> 3:15:07.160]  ships in the Gulf capable of shooting down Iranian missiles. Washington is also helping Saudi
[3:15:07.160 --> 3:15:11.320]  Arabia develop a force to protect its oil installations. American officials said the
[3:15:11.320 --> 3:15:15.960]  move is aimed at deterring an attack by Iran and reassuring Gulf states fearful that Tehran might
[3:15:15.960 --> 3:15:21.480]  react to sanctions by striking US allies in the region. Love how they're spinning this. Remember,
[3:15:21.480 --> 3:15:26.680]  oh, we got to go in against Saddam. He may attack. Washington is also seeking to discourage Israel
[3:15:26.680 --> 3:15:31.880]  from striking against Iran by demonstrating the US is preparing to contend any threat
[3:15:31.880 --> 3:15:38.600]  and containing threat. The developments come as Obama's attempts to emphasize diplomat diplomacy
[3:15:38.600 --> 3:15:42.600]  over confrontation dealing with Iran, but that's not what they're doing. In contrast, the Bush
[3:15:42.600 --> 3:15:46.920]  administration's approach have failed to persuade Tehran to open its nuclear installations
[3:15:46.920 --> 3:15:52.280]  international controls. Iran did have all its installations open. Then they said they couldn't
[3:15:52.280 --> 3:15:58.120]  have peaceful reactors that have no weapons use. Then Iran six months before they opened a new
[3:15:58.120 --> 3:16:04.760]  enrichment center announced it as they're supposed to and the media did a big hoax saying that
[3:16:05.800 --> 3:16:12.280]  they had kept the facility secret. It's all hoaxes, ladies and gentlemen. Here's another one.
[3:16:12.280 --> 3:16:18.040]  US deploys land and sea base missile shield in the Gulf of Tehran attack from Iran. So the spin
[3:16:18.040 --> 3:16:27.080]  here is that they are about to attack. Separately, the army knew into the early 1990s in their own
[3:16:27.080 --> 3:16:32.280]  manual said DU will destroy your lungs, destroy your testicles, destroy your ovaries, destroy
[3:16:32.920 --> 3:16:37.880]  your body, destroy your fertility, cause massive deformities in children. They doubled, tripled,
[3:16:37.880 --> 3:16:43.080]  quadrupled and more, and they've used it all over Iraq. They want to use it in Iran. They're
[3:16:43.080 --> 3:16:52.120]  talking about using actual nukes in Iran. Iraq to sue US Britain over to play uranium bombs, and
[3:16:52.120 --> 3:16:57.800]  I would add munitions. Iraq's Ministry of Human Rights will file a lawsuit against Britain and
[3:16:57.800 --> 3:17:04.120]  the US over the use of depleted uranium bombs in Iraq. A Iraqi minister said Iraq's Minister of
[3:17:04.120 --> 3:17:11.320]  Human Rights told the ASAP newspaper that lawsuits will be launched based on reports
[3:17:11.320 --> 3:17:14.680]  from the Iraqi ministers of science and the environment. According to reports,
[3:17:14.680 --> 3:17:18.440]  during the first year of the US and British invasion in Iraq, both countries used depleted
[3:17:18.440 --> 3:17:24.200]  uranium bombs because they use munitions for tanks as well. According to the Iraq military
[3:17:24.200 --> 3:17:29.320]  experts, the US and Britain bombed the country with nearly 2,000 tons of depleted uranium bombs
[3:17:29.320 --> 3:17:35.080]  during the early years of the war. It's more than that. Atomic radiation has increased the number
[3:17:35.080 --> 3:17:41.080]  of babies, both with the defects in the southern province of Iraq. Yeah, Basra is really bad.
[3:17:41.080 --> 3:17:45.480]  Iraqi doctors say that they have been struggling to cope with the rise of the number of cancer cases,
[3:17:45.480 --> 3:17:51.640]  especially in cities subjugated to heavily US-British bombardment. The high rate of
[3:17:51.640 --> 3:17:58.200]  birth defects and cancer cases will move in the coming years to the central and northern provinces
[3:17:58.200 --> 3:18:03.160]  of Iraq since the radiation may penetrate the soil and water by air. The ministry will seek
[3:18:03.160 --> 3:18:10.280]  compensation with the victims of the bombs. And what about our troops? What about the troops?
[3:18:10.280 --> 3:18:17.960]  They would bomb Iraqi bases and then move our troops into the bases they had attacked
[3:18:17.960 --> 3:18:21.640]  with the A-10 Warthogs, the Abrams tanks, with their Sabo rounds,
[3:18:22.920 --> 3:18:27.880]  with their other missiles and munitions they used. And then they would move them in to the
[3:18:27.880 --> 3:18:35.480]  facilities that were doused and dosed and peppered with this stuff. And the troops come home and have
[3:18:35.480 --> 3:18:40.920]  to form children and die. And that's just too bad. You see, the government claims they care about
[3:18:40.920 --> 3:18:44.440]  the military. They claim they care about the troops. They always wrap themselves in the flag
[3:18:44.440 --> 3:18:50.200]  and wrap themselves in the valor of our troops, but then flush them down the toilet when they
[3:18:50.200 --> 3:18:55.960]  get sick or die. And that's what's happening politically. Now, scarily, because this is
[3:18:55.960 --> 3:19:00.840]  from press TV, which is Iranian television directly from the horse's mouth, I ramble,
[3:19:00.840 --> 3:19:06.600]  deliver, telling blow to global powers on February 11th, the day of the Islamic Revolution.
[3:19:07.960 --> 3:19:14.520]  Iranian President Mahmoud al-Imageed said the nation will deliver a harsh blow to the global
[3:19:14.520 --> 3:19:20.200]  arrogance on this year's anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. The Islamic Revolution opened a window
[3:19:20.200 --> 3:19:25.480]  to liberty for the human race, which was trapped in the dead ends of materialism,
[3:19:25.480 --> 3:19:29.800]  Ahmad al-Imageed said during a cabinet meeting Sunday. The Islamic Revolution
[3:19:29.800 --> 3:19:33.480]  had not occurred. Liberalism and Marxism would have crushed all dignity
[3:19:33.480 --> 3:19:38.040]  and their power-seeking and money-grubbing claws. Nothing would have remained of human
[3:19:38.040 --> 3:19:42.200]  spiritual principles he added. Ahmad al-Imageed said that in the three decades of its history,
[3:19:42.920 --> 3:19:47.160]  the Islamic Republic had inspired some great developments in the world. The Iranian president
[3:19:47.160 --> 3:19:50.520]  made the remarks at the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution approaches.
[3:19:50.520 --> 3:19:53.640]  Iranians expected to pour into the streets February 11th to celebrate the occasion of
[3:19:53.640 --> 3:19:58.600]  public rallies across the country as they have done annually over the past three decades.
[3:19:58.600 --> 3:20:04.520]  What does strike a blow mean? Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH
[3:20:04.520 --> 3:20:09.880]  water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health? Because alkalizing
[3:20:09.880 --> 3:20:15.240]  water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[3:20:15.240 --> 3:20:20.760]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH
[3:20:20.760 --> 3:20:26.840]  environment. Alchivision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[3:20:26.840 --> 3:20:32.920]  Using alchivision pH drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid
[3:20:32.920 --> 3:20:38.360]  and regain your health and energy. Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to
[3:20:38.360 --> 3:20:43.720]  an alkaline level. Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or
[3:20:43.720 --> 3:20:50.120]  higher. Order your bottle of alchivision plasma pH drops now by going directly to Alchivision.com.

[3:21:01.240 --> 3:21:07.480]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[3:21:07.480 --> 3:21:12.440]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[3:21:12.440 --> 3:21:17.880]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic? Let's put this another way.
[3:21:17.880 --> 3:21:23.240]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[3:21:23.240 --> 3:21:28.760]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did. Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[3:21:28.760 --> 3:21:34.600]  You can possess it in your hand. You can take it with you. Gold is real money. Gold is honest money.
[3:21:34.600 --> 3:21:39.720]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources. To find out how you can protect your savings

[3:22:02.600 --> 3:22:08.760]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not
[3:22:08.760 --> 3:22:13.880]  relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, we'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[3:22:13.880 --> 3:22:20.040]  Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[3:22:20.040 --> 3:22:26.360]  calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:22:26.360 --> 3:22:32.120]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held
[3:22:32.120 --> 3:22:37.240]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[3:22:37.240 --> 3:22:41.560]  Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying,
[3:22:41.560 --> 3:22:46.200]  who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington,
[3:22:46.200 --> 3:22:53.240]  D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[3:24:09.400 --> 3:24:23.960]  Here's what we're going to do. In the next segment, I'm going to take some of your phone calls,
[3:24:23.960 --> 3:24:28.520]  then I'm going to get into this top story. The sharp dressed man who aided the underwear bomber
[3:24:28.520 --> 3:24:34.200]  on the flight 253 was a U.S. government agent. This is in the Detroit newspapers, Detroit TV,
[3:24:34.200 --> 3:24:38.920]  but they just report it like it's no big deal buried in the bottom. It's like ABC news,
[3:24:38.920 --> 3:24:44.520]  last Thursday, actually Wednesday, we didn't know about it until Thursday reported, oh yeah,
[3:24:44.520 --> 3:24:50.120]  there was a second man arrested and there was someone who helped him get on the plane. Oh yeah,
[3:24:50.120 --> 3:24:55.400]  and the government did want him to get on the plane and helped him. So we have them. But I wanted
[3:24:55.400 --> 3:24:59.400]  to go to Ted Anderson. He had been on this in about three weeks. Gold is going back up again
[3:24:59.400 --> 3:25:05.240]  right now, but Ted bought when it went lower. He has at the lower price while it's up. You've
[3:25:05.240 --> 3:25:10.200]  got the bankers buying up any gold they can get. You've got them trying to devalue it at the same
[3:25:10.200 --> 3:25:16.600]  time. But as they globally in a coordinated effort devalue all currency simultaneously,
[3:25:17.880 --> 3:25:22.600]  commodities are only going to go up. And I bought gold at 300 bucks an ounce or less. I
[3:25:22.600 --> 3:25:28.600]  haven't sold it with it above 1100 because it's my insurance against inflation against
[3:25:28.600 --> 3:25:34.520]  depression. It's my backup. I don't trust stocks and bonds and things like that. I don't own any
[3:25:34.520 --> 3:25:42.120]  stocks or bonds. Zero. I believe people should get into gold and silver, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:25:42.120 --> 3:25:47.880]  And no matter what gold does in the near future, races up, goes down, all the economic data and
[3:25:47.880 --> 3:25:52.360]  all the economic experts we interview here, all these different economists believe gold is only
[3:25:52.360 --> 3:25:56.760]  going up in the future because they're devaluing the currencies. Ted Anderson, good to have you
[3:25:56.760 --> 3:26:01.800]  up with us. Hey, it's always a pleasure to be up with you, Alex. And it's nice to be back for sure.
[3:26:01.800 --> 3:26:07.400]  Gold is going up. It's up. Well, it's been up $30 today. It's backed off a little bit. It's now
[3:26:07.400 --> 3:26:14.120]  up $25. It's a good run going on right now. Barack Obama announced his budget is a $1.56
[3:26:14.120 --> 3:26:19.480]  trillion deficit coming to this country. And that's just going to drive the production of money
[3:26:19.480 --> 3:26:23.800]  right up through the roof and the country can't afford its bills as it is. I don't know how he's
[3:26:23.800 --> 3:26:28.440]  going to do it. But obviously, people in the markets don't believe it's going to work because
[3:26:28.440 --> 3:26:33.880]  gold is going up and the dollar is going down. So yeah, right now, at this particular time,
[3:26:33.880 --> 3:26:39.400]  all my stuff is priced at $1,078 and gold is up in the $1,100 range,
[3:26:39.400 --> 3:26:45.720]  all as high as $1,107 already today. And by the way, somewhere in my stack,
[3:26:45.720 --> 3:26:51.320]  I'm digging around for it. I think it's an AP article where Obama says bad news coming on the
[3:26:51.320 --> 3:26:57.640]  economy. So they keep saying how great the economy is, but the truth is the joblessness
[3:26:57.640 --> 3:27:02.600]  accelerating, the factory shuts down, shutdowns are accelerating. I mean, it's just getting more
[3:27:02.600 --> 3:27:07.560]  and more serious by the minute. We're heading right into an economic meltdown with the commercial
[3:27:07.560 --> 3:27:12.920]  real estate market. We're going to be hitting that head this summer or maybe this fall. It's
[3:27:12.920 --> 3:27:17.480]  going to be very tough on the banks. I just don't know how the U.S. economy is going to make it
[3:27:17.480 --> 3:27:24.600]  through all this. That's right. Now they're saying they want another banker bailout or looting event.
[3:27:24.600 --> 3:27:30.440]  The $28 trillion they pumped in hasn't stopped the economy from imploding Reuters White House to
[3:27:30.440 --> 3:27:37.160]  paint grim fiscal picture. See, there's Reuters. I mean, that's the reality. And they're lying.
[3:27:37.160 --> 3:27:40.360]  I wonder why they lie out of one side of their mouth, but then tell the truth out of the other
[3:27:40.360 --> 3:27:45.560]  side of their mouth, Ted. Yeah, it's, it's hard to say what, what's going on up there in Washington,
[3:27:45.560 --> 3:27:50.760]  DC, and what the media's ideas and what they want to put out there is. But I can tell you right now,
[3:27:50.760 --> 3:27:58.360]  the United States dollars under attack, not only just here domestically by our President and Congress,
[3:27:58.360 --> 3:28:03.640]  but also across the nation. I mean, India again right now is trying to figure out how to get
[3:28:03.640 --> 3:28:08.760]  around their tax rules so they can start buying gold without having to pay their own little income
[3:28:08.760 --> 3:28:13.800]  tax that they have to do over there. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on this radio show two months ago said
[3:28:13.800 --> 3:28:18.600]  that when the carry trade reversed in money manipulation, currency manipulation, that it
[3:28:18.600 --> 3:28:23.960]  would come back into the U.S. And for a few months, the dollar would go back up. That happened. Now
[3:28:23.960 --> 3:28:29.720]  it's starting to fall back down again. Yeah, that's exactly what's going on today. And like I said,
[3:28:29.720 --> 3:28:35.720]  a $30 increase in gold today. And you know, I priced my things this morning based upon
[3:28:35.720 --> 3:28:41.560]  gold at 1078. So if you're looking at getting into the gold market, now is a great time to do it
[3:28:41.560 --> 3:28:45.880]  for a little bit there, Alex. I was thinking, huh, maybe we'll have a little bit of a setback.
[3:28:45.880 --> 3:28:51.080]  We can relax. Maybe the economy won't melt down as quick as we thought. Obviously, that's not the
[3:28:51.080 --> 3:29:01.000]  case. Ted, the numbers 800-686-2237-800-686-2237. Real fast, throw out some of the coin offers you've
[3:29:01.000 --> 3:29:06.520]  got. Well, the best deal that I have right now is I'm offering a franc for $255 and I give people
[3:29:06.520 --> 3:29:11.880]  a subscription for a full year to the international forecaster. That sells for $179. We give it away
[3:29:11.880 --> 3:29:19.080]  for free. I think that that's a great way to get into gold. They are 255-36 normally. I mean,
[3:29:19.080 --> 3:29:24.680]  at 1078 gold, those prices have gone up since. British sovereigns at 316.
[3:29:24.680 --> 3:29:30.360]  So you're getting a great deal on the franc and getting a $100 plus value with international
[3:29:30.360 --> 3:29:35.480]  forecaster. I guess that's the hard copy. Yeah, that actually can take it hard or you can take
[3:29:35.480 --> 3:29:40.040]  an email. Same price. Wow. That's that. I've never heard a deal. You've never offered that deal that
[3:29:40.040 --> 3:29:46.360]  I've heard on air. 800-686-2237. Ted, tell us a little bit more about the international forecaster
[3:29:46.920 --> 3:29:48.360]  deal you're offering when we come back.
[3:29:51.480 --> 3:29:58.200]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:00.920 --> 3:30:05.000]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Akola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[3:30:05.000 --> 3:30:09.240]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air. No, this isn't science fiction.

[3:31:35.800 --> 3:31:40.520]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches
[3:31:40.520 --> 3:31:45.080]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care

[3:32:09.240 --> 3:32:13.640]  especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day. Did you
[3:32:13.640 --> 3:32:18.520]  know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness. No more protection

[3:32:35.320 --> 3:32:40.600]  medicine, kill CDIF along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria, moles and fungus too,
[3:32:40.600 --> 3:32:44.760]  it's even safe around pets and children. You'll love how your skin fills with pure work, soft
[3:32:44.760 --> 3:32:49.560]  and supple. No more dry skin. Here's to a little piece of mind knowing that your hands are still
[3:32:49.560 --> 3:32:57.160]  germ-free hours later. Call now toll-free 888-245-0300 to get your hands on pure works and get pure
[3:32:57.160 --> 3:33:01.000]  works on your hands. That's 888-245-0300.
[3:33:01.000 --> 3:33:25.000]  So, Ted, to get this straight, you're offering, if somebody buys a frank coin, and I've actually seen
[3:33:25.000 --> 3:33:31.320]  your markups on those, it's three to five dollars. It's what you're making. You know, people say,
[3:33:31.320 --> 3:33:37.080]  I saw Ted Anderson's corporate filings. They made eight million dollars last year. Yes,
[3:33:37.080 --> 3:33:43.880]  with a 5% markup. I guess some special coins have like a 10% markup. I mean, what other business has
[3:33:43.880 --> 3:33:51.800]  markups that low? But you've got gold up 30 bucks today. He's selling you gold with a 5% markup,
[3:33:51.800 --> 3:33:56.440]  or three or five. I haven't seen the latest sheet. I get sent the actual Midas Resources
[3:33:56.440 --> 3:34:03.240]  purchase sheets. And so, with markup added, this is way lower than you can buy this coin anywhere
[3:34:03.240 --> 3:34:09.240]  else, and you're getting a free international forecaster, either digital twice a week or hard
[3:34:09.240 --> 3:34:14.920]  copy, mailed to you. Ted, again, how much does the international forecaster cost?
[3:34:14.920 --> 3:34:19.960]  It's $159 a year. That's what the subscription rate is.
[3:34:19.960 --> 3:34:23.560]  So that's, I mean, that's more than half the cost of the Frank itself.
[3:34:23.560 --> 3:34:27.240]  It is. Actually, the people that buy the Frank at this time, I mean, I,
[3:34:28.040 --> 3:34:34.760]  there is no markup on this. There's a mark down. I lose money. For the person who was saying that
[3:34:34.760 --> 3:34:41.160]  my eight million dollar sales, whatever that one year was, is a bad thing. I don't know why anybody
[3:34:41.160 --> 3:34:45.720]  would think that's bad. Eight million dollars in people's hands for gold. I think that's good.
[3:34:45.720 --> 3:34:51.720]  But anyways, nonetheless, it's no, no, Ted, I wish, I wish you made eight million profit because
[3:34:51.720 --> 3:34:56.520]  we'd be on more radio stations and better systems and more employees. But I mean,
[3:34:57.080 --> 3:35:01.800]  if you made eight million one year profit, what is that like 300, 400, 500,000?
[3:35:01.800 --> 3:35:05.080]  Well, yeah, I mean, it would be a, it would be a real high number and I've never made eight
[3:35:05.080 --> 3:35:11.080]  million yet, but people do publish some funny numbers. I got it. I had, I had Texas monthly
[3:35:11.080 --> 3:35:16.120]  asking me and I said, I don't know what Ted Anderson makes. That's why I'm asking you.
[3:35:16.120 --> 3:35:22.360]  Yeah. Well, you know, last year I lost a little bit of money by the time I was done buying all
[3:35:22.360 --> 3:35:28.120]  those ads for the creature from Jekyll Island and follow the Republic on places like Rush Limba
[3:35:28.120 --> 3:35:33.640]  and Fox News and all these different places. But we've spread the word, you know, I really, I'm
[3:35:33.640 --> 3:35:38.920]  not, I'm not, I mean, Alex, you've been, but we're not communists too. So I actually wish you'd
[3:35:38.920 --> 3:35:44.040]  make some money, Ted. Well, I, I have to because if I don't, I'm in danger of having to shut down
[3:35:44.040 --> 3:35:51.560]  the operation and I know that nobody wants that. So 800 686 2237 folks. So, so it's a,
[3:35:52.200 --> 3:35:58.200]  how much is the coin again? Well, the coin currently right now is 255 36. Now, if you
[3:35:58.200 --> 3:36:06.840]  think about that for a minute, if you subtract $159 off of that 255 36, I don't have a calculator.
[3:36:06.840 --> 3:36:12.280]  I didn't do the math, but you're obviously getting a gold coin for a way, way, way less
[3:36:12.280 --> 3:36:16.840]  than spot gold. Once you consider the discount for that newsletter, you're getting that coin for
[3:36:16.840 --> 3:36:23.080]  $104. Yeah, that's right. And it's a fifth of an ounce of gold. So 104 multiplied. We'll just
[3:36:23.080 --> 3:36:29.640]  take 100 by four. That's $400. I guess you get to buy gold for $400 an ounce. Once again, try doing
[3:36:29.640 --> 3:36:40.600]  that anywhere else. But you know, 800 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 or minus resources.com. Ted,
[3:36:40.600 --> 3:36:45.400]  thank you for coming on with us today. Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex. You bet. Take care.
[3:36:45.400 --> 3:36:54.040]  Again, Ted Anderson, ladies and gentlemen, 800 686 2237 joining us here on the air today.
[3:36:54.040 --> 3:37:01.960]  Okay, I promise to go to your phone calls, but I also have two other stacks of news I've got
[3:37:01.960 --> 3:37:10.040]  to get to. So I'm going to go to your calls. And we've got 14 minutes left or 13 minutes left.
[3:37:10.040 --> 3:37:15.720]  Now we have longer than that. We have even do math now. We got 23 minutes left in the
[3:37:16.920 --> 3:37:21.160]  in the radio broadcast today. So I'm now going to go back to your phone calls.
[3:37:21.160 --> 3:37:23.800]  Who's up next here, John?
[3:37:26.120 --> 3:37:28.600]  Cass in British Columbia, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:37:29.480 --> 3:37:37.080]  Hi, Alex. Brilliant show today. I have a quick question for you. Sure. CBC or CNN had a short
[3:37:37.080 --> 3:37:42.760]  blurb indicating that Haitians are being offered free land if they relocate to Africa.
[3:37:42.760 --> 3:37:44.840]  You get any ideas what that might be about?
[3:37:44.840 --> 3:37:51.160]  Well, here, let me let me search engine that. Let me see.
[3:37:53.080 --> 3:38:04.760]  Haitians being offered free land to move to Africa.
[3:38:04.760 --> 3:38:15.240]  Yeah. And there it is. Print that for me. It says Senegal offers land to Haitians, BBC.
[3:38:16.680 --> 3:38:19.800]  Senegal's president says he will offer free land.
[3:38:22.520 --> 3:38:25.480]  And I'm reading from way across the room, representation,
[3:38:26.040 --> 3:38:29.800]  reparation. I'm trying to read this from like 10 feet away on a tiny screen.
[3:38:29.800 --> 3:38:36.120]  The people affected by the earthquake in Haiti. So I guess that's true.
[3:38:37.320 --> 3:38:43.240]  President Wade said Haitians were sons and daughters of Africa since Haiti was founded
[3:38:43.240 --> 3:38:50.120]  by slaves, putting some thought to be from Senegal. So that's a nice offer from him.
[3:38:51.480 --> 3:38:54.840]  So you don't think that has anything to do? I was kind of thinking that with
[3:38:54.840 --> 3:39:00.040]  the valuables that they were sort of trying to get in Exodus so that
[3:39:01.160 --> 3:39:05.000]  they could go in after their resources a little bit easier.
[3:39:05.800 --> 3:39:07.720]  Well, there's not a lot of valuables in Haiti.
[3:39:08.520 --> 3:39:17.080]  No. I mean, I had thought in some of the reports they indicated that there might be oil and some
[3:39:17.080 --> 3:39:23.000]  gold. But I don't know if Senegal would be getting that. But I mean, who knows?
[3:39:23.000 --> 3:39:27.560]  No. You just informed me of this. So I don't know. What do you think?
[3:39:28.600 --> 3:39:34.840]  Well, I sort of thought that in one of the reports I read, it had indicated that
[3:39:37.400 --> 3:39:45.800]  the U.S. and Canada has major holdings in Haiti. So I sort of thought with the way things go that
[3:39:46.600 --> 3:39:50.280]  it would be quite convenient if some of the people left.
[3:39:50.280 --> 3:39:56.840]  Sure. And gave up their land to the corporation. So that was just my sense on it. And I just
[3:39:56.840 --> 3:39:59.880]  wondered what you thought about it because you're usually pretty right on.
[3:40:00.600 --> 3:40:03.800]  Well, thank you, Cass. I don't know enough about it to be able to comment.
[3:40:04.440 --> 3:40:10.280]  That's my answer. But the West and the Globalist already control Haiti. A very small percentage
[3:40:10.280 --> 3:40:15.480]  of people actually own the land. Most of the people are in compact cities at or near starvation level.
[3:40:15.480 --> 3:40:22.200]  And so I think this is probably just a nice offer from Senegal. But I don't know.
[3:40:23.160 --> 3:40:28.200]  I can't really comment because I don't know. But I could do some research and give you my
[3:40:28.200 --> 3:40:32.040]  opinion. But thank you. Interesting point. Jera in California, you're on the air.
[3:40:33.560 --> 3:40:38.200]  Hi, Alex. Hey, I've dubbed you America's Archangel Alex.
[3:40:38.200 --> 3:40:41.560]  Well, that's sweet of you. I try to be an angel. I can be a little devil sometimes, too.
[3:40:41.560 --> 3:40:48.600]  I like John Travolta in that movie, Michael. I think that what they've done here now,
[3:40:48.600 --> 3:40:52.440]  I watched Shadow Government with the data grab on our medical records.
[3:40:53.320 --> 3:40:59.160]  And they've got our financial records with the IRS and Google's got our internet activity.
[3:40:59.160 --> 3:41:02.840]  And they've got our shopping purchases. And they all share it.
[3:41:03.880 --> 3:41:09.080]  Right in the cell phone conversations now. So now that they've got our medical records.
[3:41:09.080 --> 3:41:15.960]  And we know what that's going to be like. If you look at Diebold voting machines
[3:41:16.760 --> 3:41:22.760]  that are completely corrupt and hackable and all of that. I forget the movie that
[3:41:23.560 --> 3:41:30.280]  is all about the Diebold voting machines. I forget the name, too. It was on HBO.
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:35.320]  That was great. You can get it on Netflix. But anyway, I believe that the nude body
[3:41:35.320 --> 3:41:44.840]  scanners, with that information, with your nude body and every minute detail,
[3:41:44.840 --> 3:41:50.200]  will dictate the recipe, a designed recipe for slow kill.
[3:41:51.000 --> 3:41:54.920]  Well, no, that's actually admitted, Jared. I appreciate your call.
[3:41:56.040 --> 3:42:02.920]  That's admitted to a certain extent. The biometric 360 scan they get of your body,
[3:42:02.920 --> 3:42:07.480]  they then admit is used by cameras attached to your name later because of the airport.
[3:42:07.480 --> 3:42:10.840]  They know your name. They record you. They save that biometric data.
[3:42:10.840 --> 3:42:14.680]  They can make a biometric imprint off your thumb, your finger, your hand, your face,
[3:42:14.680 --> 3:42:18.840]  your eyes, your retina. Now it's your whole body. So even if you're wearing a hat,
[3:42:18.840 --> 3:42:24.280]  they can shoot through your clothes with it. And off any part of your body, get that digital
[3:42:24.280 --> 3:42:29.160]  algorithm. So yes, that's a big part of it. Let's go ahead and talk to Carl in Kentucky.
[3:42:29.160 --> 3:42:33.720]  Carl, you're on the air. Yeah, Alex, I just wanted to make a quick statement.
[3:42:33.720 --> 3:42:38.600]  Doesn't this global warming fraud just blow their excuse for chemtrailing us?
[3:42:38.600 --> 3:42:44.840]  And also, what do you feel is the probability rate of them actually the elite creating a
[3:42:44.840 --> 3:42:48.280]  controlled nuclear war and it getting out of control?
[3:42:49.960 --> 3:42:54.920]  Each point is excellent. We have the White House scientists and others admitting that they've been
[3:42:54.920 --> 3:43:00.760]  in spraying the atmosphere to manipulate the weather. They admit they have hurricane systems
[3:43:00.760 --> 3:43:05.400]  with aircraft they can create. That's all declassified. But you talk about it, you get laughed at.
[3:43:06.360 --> 3:43:10.840]  It just shows the amazing ignorance of the general public. But we're here trying to educate them.
[3:43:11.480 --> 3:43:15.960]  That was your first point. And I believe they can create environmental disasters
[3:43:16.520 --> 3:43:19.720]  with their systems as a pretext to sell their global warming.
[3:43:19.720 --> 3:43:25.400]  As for controlled nuclear wars, they now say they can have controlled nuclear wars. The Pentagon
[3:43:27.000 --> 3:43:31.320]  changed its policy three years ago to preemptive nuclear strikes, saying they're going to use
[3:43:31.320 --> 3:43:36.760]  an arsenal of smaller weapons that are ground penetrating. But ground penetrating, instead
[3:43:36.760 --> 3:43:44.120]  of airburst, create a lot more radiation than just the airburst. And so just basic understanding
[3:43:44.120 --> 3:43:48.520]  of nuclear weapons, it flies in the face of that. A weapon that detonates on the ground
[3:43:48.520 --> 3:43:54.200]  and combines with all of the surrounding metals to create other highly radioactive
[3:43:54.200 --> 3:44:00.680]  and very toxic isotopes. And so for them to say we have a clean way of nuking Iran or other
[3:44:00.680 --> 3:44:05.640]  countries is asinine. I appreciate your call, Carl. Good points. Lauren in Minnesota,
[3:44:05.640 --> 3:44:10.120]  you're on the air. Go ahead, Lauren. Hi, Alex, President Planet TV member here.
[3:44:10.120 --> 3:44:16.440]  Thank you. Just a quick call to action from the Minnesota sovereignty project
[3:44:16.440 --> 3:44:24.280]  made by a Vietnam veteran on Thursday, February 4th, 10 a.m. South entrance to the state office
[3:44:24.280 --> 3:44:29.080]  building across Wright Street from Sears. We the people will be assembling to exercise our
[3:44:29.080 --> 3:44:33.720]  first amendment rights, encourage state reps to support our constitutional options,
[3:44:33.720 --> 3:44:39.480]  as provided in the 10th Amendment to the Constitution. Join us. Thank you, healthcareterry.com.
[3:44:40.520 --> 3:44:44.200]  All right. Thank you so much, Lauren. Ben in California, you're on the air.
[3:44:44.200 --> 3:44:50.920]  I just have a couple of questions. One, Mike Ruppert is one of the leading people in the
[3:44:50.920 --> 3:44:56.200]  now 11th Truth Movement, yet he's also promoting peak oil endlessly with his movie Collapse.
[3:44:56.760 --> 3:45:01.640]  I wonder what you think of that. In your movie Endgame, you mentioned that peak oil was a fraud.
[3:45:02.200 --> 3:45:07.880]  The second relates to this so-called deep banking website called conspiracyscience.com.
[3:45:07.880 --> 3:45:15.160]  It's a step above the others. This guy is kind of just going out of his way to attack you in
[3:45:15.160 --> 3:45:23.080]  your movies. He gives huge reviews of them that would be very convincing if you haven't been
[3:45:23.080 --> 3:45:28.520]  awake for a long time. So it will bite you back in the future, I believe, if you're underdressed.
[3:45:28.520 --> 3:45:33.240]  It's called conspiracy science. No, no, no, sir. Sir, when you address things that are
[3:45:33.240 --> 3:45:38.600]  baloney and only make some worse, I appreciate your call. People constantly make stuff up about me.
[3:45:38.600 --> 3:45:44.600]  They constantly lie. They constantly edit videos together to try to make me look stupid. And I'm
[3:45:44.600 --> 3:45:49.240]  not really worried about it. This isn't about Alex Jones. This is about waking people up and
[3:45:49.240 --> 3:45:54.600]  getting them to think. And I'm not aware of the second issue you brought up, reviews of my movies.
[3:45:55.320 --> 3:45:59.320]  My movies are what the globalists have said, what they're actually doing.
[3:45:59.320 --> 3:46:11.400]  Fall the Republic, I mean, is in their own words. And so people attack it. Of course,
[3:46:11.400 --> 3:46:15.000]  they're going to attack it. My films have been seen hundreds of millions of times
[3:46:15.000 --> 3:46:19.560]  conservatively for free online. We are leading the revolution against tyranny.
[3:46:20.120 --> 3:46:25.560]  So of course, we're going to be attacked from every side. And if I spent all day responding
[3:46:25.560 --> 3:46:30.680]  to stuff that people say about me, this would not be a popular radio show. People tune in here
[3:46:31.240 --> 3:46:36.680]  to hear information, to hear news cover, to hear my analysis, to hear the guests we bring on,
[3:46:37.880 --> 3:46:45.000]  to hear what threats we think are important or how we're rallying people against corruption.
[3:46:48.920 --> 3:46:54.520]  If people get lied to and set back in their development, that's the fault of the liars,
[3:46:54.520 --> 3:47:00.200]  not the fault of me. Now, on the subject of Mike Rupert, I have nothing to say.
[3:47:01.160 --> 3:47:09.400]  Okay, I have nothing to say about him. He has called for population reduction.
[3:47:13.080 --> 3:47:19.960]  And he's pretty well. I just have nothing to say. I mean, it's just a non-issue.
[3:47:19.960 --> 3:47:26.200]  We're exposing the global warming fraud. It's a joke. It's imploded. We're exposing the
[3:47:26.920 --> 3:47:31.480]  artificial scarcity folks that are trying to cut off the resources. There's more oil,
[3:47:31.480 --> 3:47:35.560]  more natural gas been discovered than we can ever even use. It's a joke. There's so much.
[3:47:36.280 --> 3:47:41.000]  And so I don't really get into personalities unless it's somebody like Glenn Beck.
[3:47:41.800 --> 3:47:45.720]  Look, Michael Savage comes out. In fact, queue up that clip we played yesterday
[3:47:45.720 --> 3:47:52.200]  where he was talking about the ear gun and the first clip, the first clip we played yesterday
[3:47:52.200 --> 3:47:57.880]  where he's talking about the Reichstag and the ear gun and how Emmanuel's dad was one of the top
[3:47:57.880 --> 3:48:02.840]  terrorists and how he says that he believes Emmanuel will stage terror attacks. It was the
[3:48:02.840 --> 3:48:09.640]  first clip you played yesterday. I mean, you know, I want to give people credit when they come out
[3:48:09.640 --> 3:48:14.680]  and tell the truth. I don't want to be enemies with Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity,
[3:48:14.680 --> 3:48:21.480]  or any of these guys, but Glenn Beck has taken over the Tea Party and he is neutralizing the
[3:48:21.480 --> 3:48:26.680]  opposition to the new world order. And I know he's attacked us in the past and I know he's bad news.
[3:48:27.320 --> 3:48:30.280]  In fact, let's go to break with Michael Savage telling it like it is. Here it is.
[3:48:31.240 --> 3:48:36.200]  Right now, what we have is a dictatorship run by a gang. It's a gang under Obama. Although,
[3:48:36.200 --> 3:48:41.080]  I think he's the front man. I think that soon they're going to realize that he's more intelligent
[3:48:41.080 --> 3:48:45.560]  than they originally thought and they're going to find out that they're going to be left out in
[3:48:45.560 --> 3:48:50.840]  the cold. But that's going to take a little while before the Ram Emmanuel gang realizes that Obama
[3:48:50.840 --> 3:48:56.040]  has outsmarted them and he's not just their front man. I made a prediction on the show yesterday
[3:48:56.040 --> 3:49:02.680]  that I'll repeat right now so that you can mark it down. Savage predicts a Reichstag fire-like event
[3:49:03.240 --> 3:49:08.920]  sometime within the next year or two in America that will have been conducted by the government
[3:49:08.920 --> 3:49:15.240]  and blamed upon subversive elements in order to permit a dictatorship and a naked dictatorship
[3:49:15.240 --> 3:49:20.120]  to emerge in this country. If you think I'm making this up, you're right. I'm making it up,
[3:49:20.120 --> 3:49:23.640]  but I'm not making it up at a whole cloth. I'm making it up out of historical cloth.
[3:49:25.240 --> 3:49:30.520]  Ram Emmanuel is a very devious man. Ram Emmanuel has deep roots going back to
[3:49:31.320 --> 3:49:37.000]  dictatorial inclinations. You want me to open that one up? Would you like to discuss Ram
[3:49:37.000 --> 3:49:44.200]  Emmanuel and who he is and what his background is and his father's background? His father was
[3:49:44.200 --> 3:49:48.920]  a member of the Ergun in the early days of Israel, which I think is quite ironic when you think about
[3:49:48.920 --> 3:49:55.400]  it. Here you have the most anti-Israel administration in modern American history perhaps since Eisenhower
[3:49:56.920 --> 3:50:01.000]  and the chief of staff's name is Ram Emmanuel. He is from Israel and his father fought with
[3:50:01.000 --> 3:50:07.240]  Mayer Begin in the Ergun in the early days of the foundation of Israel. Some would call, some would
[3:50:07.240 --> 3:50:11.880]  term the Ergun a terrorist organization. They did horrible things. They blew up the King David
[3:50:11.880 --> 3:50:17.560]  Hotel killing British soldiers. If they had any opponents within their own party, meaning Jews
[3:50:17.560 --> 3:50:22.360]  against Jews, they took the men that they caught who they didn't approve and they hung their hand,
[3:50:22.360 --> 3:50:27.160]  they put their hands on the top of doors and they closed doors on their fingers and broke their
[3:50:27.160 --> 3:50:34.280]  fingers. They were not nice guys. They were powerful, brutal, bloodthirsty revolutionaries. That's
[3:50:34.280 --> 3:50:39.560]  who created Israel and that's how every country on earth has been created by basically by tough
[3:50:39.560 --> 3:50:44.520]  guys who are killers. There's not a country on earth that's been created by nice men. So let's
[3:50:44.520 --> 3:50:50.280]  not make this an exception. So now Ram Emmanuel grows up in the home of a Jewish revolutionary
[3:50:50.280 --> 3:50:56.600]  in Israel and now he is the chief of staff to the president of the United States who happens to
[3:50:56.600 --> 3:51:00.120]  stab Israel in the back as one of his first acts. And then he goes into how they're going to stage
[3:51:00.120 --> 3:51:06.040]  terror attacks. When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind? If it's Berky

[3:52:03.240 --> 3:52:09.320]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not
[3:52:09.320 --> 3:52:14.440]  relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[3:52:14.440 --> 3:52:20.600]  Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[3:52:20.600 --> 3:52:26.920]  calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:52:26.920 --> 3:52:32.920]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell bent
[3:52:32.920 --> 3:52:37.800]  on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[3:52:37.800 --> 3:52:42.040]  Bernanke and the arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying,
[3:52:42.040 --> 3:52:46.760]  who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington,
[3:52:46.760 --> 3:52:55.560]  DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.

[3:53:02.280 --> 3:53:07.320]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny. When the government
[3:53:07.320 --> 3:53:13.320]  fears the people, there is liberty. Our God given right to life and liberty and the right to determine
[3:53:13.320 --> 3:53:18.920]  what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy. If we the people do not diligently
[3:53:18.920 --> 3:53:24.600]  assert these rights, they may be taken away and lost forever. Utopia silver is known for fighting

[3:53:59.720 --> 3:54:16.200]  Another issue here. I got on the toll road to drive to Dallas to go interview Dave Mustain
[3:54:16.200 --> 3:54:22.840]  a megadeth a few months ago and you don't pay cash anymore. You don't even have to get a little
[3:54:22.840 --> 3:54:30.440]  transponder. They just scan your license plate and send you a $20.80 bill. Now Texas taxpayers paid
[3:54:31.080 --> 3:54:35.640]  for that toll road that I-30 toll road saying it'd be a loop around Austin but they just put a toll
[3:54:35.640 --> 3:54:42.120]  road on it. But the point is that's what the license plate reading cameras are doing. That's
[3:54:42.120 --> 3:54:47.080]  the science and they want to put them around every major city including Austin on all the major roads.
[3:54:47.080 --> 3:54:53.240]  What is it? Ten roads in Austin and tax you everywhere you go. I was on the road for about
[3:54:53.240 --> 3:55:00.280]  10 miles and got a $20.80 bill. Alexander Jones. My license plate number.
[3:55:02.360 --> 3:55:06.600]  Everything. In fact, let me just scratch out my license plate number and I'll show people this.
[3:55:09.320 --> 3:55:15.080]  Here. Zoom in on this with the document cam for prisonplanet.tv viewers. MSB.
[3:55:15.080 --> 3:55:26.440]  A private corporation P.O. Box 16777-Austin, Texas 78761. Got the toll free number there for them.
[3:55:28.040 --> 3:55:36.440]  The vehicle shown below and then it goes into what I did and where I drove and what I did
[3:55:36.440 --> 3:55:49.960]  and nonpayment. Look, $20.80 right there. That's big brother, ladies and gentlemen. That's the
[3:55:49.960 --> 3:55:54.840]  control grid and Schwarzenegger wants to make it where all roads in California are taxed.
[3:55:55.400 --> 3:56:00.920]  This is the fake green economy. This is the scam. The NAFTA superhighways grabbing our roads,
[3:56:00.920 --> 3:56:06.600]  giving them to bankers, giving them to globalists. This is the scam. This is the fraud. This is what
[3:56:06.600 --> 3:56:11.960]  they're doing to us. This is what we're fighting and the services get cut that government gives you
[3:56:12.760 --> 3:56:17.080]  and the services they do give you are a nightmare and the taxes go up and up and up and up and up
[3:56:17.080 --> 3:56:22.920]  on interest to the debt or just flat out looting where we pay to build the roads. They take existing
[3:56:22.920 --> 3:56:27.640]  roads or new roads and slap toll roads on it and even when the legislature votes it down,
[3:56:27.640 --> 3:56:34.600]  it continues. There's no way to stop these criminals until we stand up and take our state back and
[3:56:34.600 --> 3:56:44.360]  start prosecuting them. But at first they had, we had to pay cash or get a tag, but literally the
[3:56:44.360 --> 3:56:49.480]  news reported most people wouldn't do it and just ran it. So they said, don't worry. We'll just put
[3:56:49.480 --> 3:56:55.400]  the license plate readers in and they just send you a bill and track where you're driving and
[3:56:55.400 --> 3:56:59.640]  what you're doing. And they already have these license plate readers up on every major highway
[3:56:59.640 --> 3:57:03.960]  and little roads and middle of nowhere. They are tracking everywhere you go and what you do.
[3:57:03.960 --> 3:57:09.560]  This is big brother and I meant to get to this today and I just didn't. But tomorrow I will
[3:57:10.600 --> 3:57:16.440]  Senate burglary CIA domestic black ops team arrested. Burma's covered that some last night.
[3:57:17.080 --> 3:57:22.440]  The underwear bomber, the government announces, oh, we let him go on the plane and it told him
[3:57:22.440 --> 3:57:27.080]  to go ahead and give him the visa and material. So we'd know. And then they lied about somebody
[3:57:27.080 --> 3:57:31.320]  else with a bomb on the plane and they lied about the sharp dress man and they admit that they let
[3:57:31.320 --> 3:57:34.600]  him get on the plane. So obviously that guy works for them. It's hidden in plain view.
[3:57:35.320 --> 3:57:39.880]  Such a big deal. I covered it a lot Sunday, but I'm going to cover it more tomorrow and tomorrow
[3:57:39.880 --> 3:57:44.280]  we've got jam packed with extremely informative guests. I've got one particular guest that's
[3:57:44.280 --> 3:57:48.120]  set for tomorrow, but it's so big. I'm not going to say anything until they're here.
[3:57:48.120 --> 3:57:55.160]  I'll just leave it at that for everyone. And in closing, I just want to ask listeners to
[3:57:56.280 --> 3:58:00.840]  research the information we have to support us by the books and videos and info wars.com.
[3:58:00.840 --> 3:58:05.400]  But more importantly, tell your email list, your Myspace, your Facebook, your Twitter

[3:58:22.440 --> 3:58:27.800]  videos. This is an information war. The globalists are moving to start curtailing the internet.
[3:58:27.800 --> 3:58:31.400]  We need to use it now like we're not going to have it in the future, but also fight for its
[3:58:31.400 --> 3:58:36.920]  continued future and freedom. Pre-transmission starts now, jam packed, great job crew. See you

[3:58:51.000 --> 3:58:55.560]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[3:58:55.560 --> 3:58:59.880]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:58:59.880 --> 3:59:04.920]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[3:59:04.920 --> 3:59:10.520]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[3:59:10.520 --> 3:59:15.640]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[3:59:15.640 --> 3:59:20.920]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[3:59:20.920 --> 3:59:25.400]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[3:59:25.400 --> 3:59:30.200]  from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[3:59:30.200 --> 3:59:34.200]  insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[3:59:34.200 --> 3:59:40.920]  Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
