[00:00.000 --> 00:19.760]  I'm watching the midterms, then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[00:19.760 --> 00:27.520]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[00:27.520 --> 00:29.520]  He's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:29.520 --> 00:31.520]  You want to drop! You want to drop!
[00:31.520 --> 00:33.520]  Damn!
[00:33.520 --> 00:35.520]  What the fuck is this?
[00:35.520 --> 00:37.520]  What the fuck is this?
[00:37.520 --> 00:39.520]  What the fuck is this?
[00:39.520 --> 00:41.520]  What the fuck is this?
[00:41.520 --> 00:43.520]  What the fuck is this?
[00:43.520 --> 00:45.520]  You're in the presidency.
[00:45.520 --> 00:47.520]  You're in support of this.
[00:47.520 --> 01:09.520]  And you would think everybody in the countries is like, to the bunker.
[01:17.520 --> 01:32.520]  Have you heard of this? Blasts in China, all within a week, 10 explosions, 10 bomb blasts in one country in less than a week.
[01:32.520 --> 01:46.520]  Between October 21st and October 27th, there were at least 10 mysterious explosions throughout China, killing at least 13 people and injuring many more.
[01:46.520 --> 02:03.520]  These mysterious explosions came just weeks before Xi Jinping was anointed as a revered leader of the CCP, preparing him for next year's CCP Congress, which is scheduled for next October.
[02:03.520 --> 02:14.520]  This gives Xi less than a year to make good on his commitment to absorb Taiwan into the CCP and unite all of China under communism.
[02:14.520 --> 02:21.520]  And allowing this to happen, we'd be handing the world economy over to the communist Chinese.
[02:21.520 --> 02:33.520]  The CCP deploys massive fishing fleets to illegally plunder protected areas such as the Galapagos Islands, because they are hungry.
[02:33.520 --> 02:46.520]  The CCP is undergoing a food shortage crisis, warning people to stock up on essential items, and adopting laws against food waste and binge eating.
[02:46.520 --> 02:53.520]  The CCP has been buying massive amounts of farmland in Australia and the United States.
[02:53.520 --> 03:06.520]  Handing over the world economy to the communist Chinese would be national suicide for both nations, who have already been infiltrated at the highest levels of government by the CCP.
[03:06.520 --> 03:12.520]  A handful of Republican senators visited Taiwan to vow US support.
[03:12.520 --> 03:18.520]  The US Secretary of State has said that the US will defend Taiwan.
[03:18.520 --> 03:26.520]  And Australia's Minister for Defense has vowed to back the US and Taiwan against China.
[03:26.520 --> 03:30.520]  But who currently has control over the Australian military?
[03:30.520 --> 03:33.520]  Or the US military?
[03:33.520 --> 03:46.520]  The CCP's own woke American puppet, General Mark Milley, says that the US is incapable of defending itself against China's hypersonic missile tech.
[03:46.520 --> 03:52.520]  Psyops, something we have all been learning about firsthand.
[03:52.520 --> 04:05.520]  Many of us have read how they've done it in history, but today we are all witnessing in real time how the banking cartel is capable of orchestrating a world war.
[04:05.520 --> 04:10.520]  As China's housing giant Evergrand defaults on billions of dollars of debt,
[04:10.520 --> 04:17.520]  Goldman Sachs is busy buying up these garbage assets with US taxpayer dollars.
[04:17.520 --> 04:29.520]  Goldman Sachs is bailing out the CCP with US tax dollars while the CCP is preparing to wage war against the US.
[04:29.520 --> 04:38.520]  By hook or by crook, the ethos of the communist Chinese is what the bankers want for their world government dream.
[04:38.520 --> 04:45.520]  Every individual connected to a central bank controlled by a social credit score
[04:45.520 --> 04:52.520]  and made to accept endless injections of unknown substances into their body.
[04:52.520 --> 04:55.520]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[04:55.520 --> 05:00.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, stand by. We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[05:00.520 --> 05:07.520]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[05:07.520 --> 05:13.520]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[05:13.520 --> 05:18.520]  Horrible crashes and, again, so many toxins on them.
[05:18.520 --> 05:26.520]  All of the new tropic products that we sell at Infowars.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality,
[05:26.520 --> 05:30.520]  and they're long lasting and they help focus your mind.
[05:30.520 --> 05:37.520]  And right now, our strongest product, the three new tropics we have, Rainforce Plus, Rainforce Ultra,
[05:37.520 --> 05:43.520]  and Turboforce are back in stock at Infowars.com.
[05:43.520 --> 05:49.520]  Turboforce has been sold out for more than six months. It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[05:49.520 --> 05:56.520]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash,
[05:56.520 --> 06:00.520]  and it's available right now and it funds the Infowar a 360 win.
[06:27.520 --> 06:29.520]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[06:40.520 --> 06:48.520]  Infowars, because there is a war on for your mind.
[06:48.520 --> 06:56.520]  All right, I am going to lay out news and information today that is the absolute key to victory and liberty
[06:56.520 --> 07:01.520]  and it will save billions of lives and change the entire course of human development.
[07:01.520 --> 07:06.520]  Everything is now 100% crystal clear, all the pieces have fallen into place,
[07:06.520 --> 07:18.520]  and the good news is there's a chain reaction taking place right now that is simply amazing.
[07:18.520 --> 07:26.520]  And what am I talking about? Well, this came out actually six months ago
[07:26.520 --> 07:32.520]  and we covered it with several guests and we read articles about it and showed documents on air.
[07:32.520 --> 07:39.520]  But then I saw stories last night that when I first saw it on Twitter, I thought it was a joke.
[07:39.520 --> 07:43.520]  But then I went and looked at it and there it was in the link to the federal court
[07:43.520 --> 07:47.520]  and it was even the mainstream news. They were reporting it like it was no big deal.
[07:47.520 --> 07:52.520]  And then it reminded me of the documents that leaked in the United States
[07:52.520 --> 07:57.520]  and the documents that leaked in Brazil and in the European Union.
[07:57.520 --> 08:04.520]  It was over 50 countries signed on to it. A secret agreement.
[08:04.520 --> 08:16.520]  A secret agreement with Pfizer and the United Nations with billions of dollars of payoff money
[08:16.520 --> 08:22.520]  paid by Bill Gates, that's in the news today too, to the government officials and the media
[08:22.520 --> 08:31.520]  right down to reporters. I mean, small reporters got hundreds of thousands of dollars, big ones, millions.
[08:31.520 --> 08:38.520]  The numbers are about four billion that we now know of that he was the bag man for.
[08:38.520 --> 08:43.520]  I mean, this is just over the top and what do the secret agreements say?
[08:43.520 --> 08:49.520]  Well, we don't have but part of it and it puts Pfizer in control of the governments
[08:49.520 --> 08:56.520]  and in the response to COVID and to all news and information.
[08:56.520 --> 09:04.520]  See, you've heard governments can sign treaties with foreign powers, but can those treaties supersede
[09:04.520 --> 09:09.520]  the Constitution and Bill of Rights? That's been argued by globalists for 100 years.
[09:09.520 --> 09:15.520]  That's how they've been pushing the UN and all these bodies to transfer our sovereignty.
[09:15.520 --> 09:23.520]  But to say that government can contract secretly with a corporation and a consortium of corporations
[09:23.520 --> 09:30.520]  to control information, to control government response, and to not let the public even know
[09:30.520 --> 09:40.520]  what is in a shot for 50 years. And that's what came out, a document we didn't know about
[09:40.520 --> 09:45.520]  but they showed it in federal court and told the federal judge, we want you to seal,
[09:45.520 --> 09:51.520]  because all these lawsuits, all of our secret studies and what's in these shots,
[09:51.520 --> 09:55.520]  and we want to be able to change what's in them for whatever we want.
[09:55.520 --> 10:00.520]  I mean, it's just 007 license to kill, us.
[10:00.520 --> 10:06.520]  And the judge is like, yeah.
[10:06.520 --> 10:12.520]  Hasn't ruled yet, but said, yeah, that's what you got a contract with Homeland Security and FEMA.
[10:12.520 --> 10:17.520]  A contract. And so this is what Trump did to us.
[10:17.520 --> 10:22.520]  This is what warp speed and all this is, and all these other countries signed on to it.
[10:22.520 --> 10:28.520]  He, of course, didn't read it. And I remember Trump about two months ago did three interviews.
[10:28.520 --> 10:32.520]  In fact, I forgot to tell the crew to find some. We played it at the time.
[10:32.520 --> 10:39.520]  Headline, Trump says Pfizer has more power than governments should be looked at.
[10:39.520 --> 10:47.520]  And Trump was in a Fox News. He was in a NBC interview and he was on Newsmax all three times
[10:47.520 --> 10:50.520]  and said people should really look at Pfizer. Very interesting.
[10:50.520 --> 10:52.520]  I don't think you should have to give people booster shots.
[10:52.520 --> 10:55.520]  I don't think you should make people take shots.
[10:55.520 --> 11:00.520]  I'm very interested for people to research that they'll be blown away by how much power Pfizer has,
[11:00.520 --> 11:04.520]  because he knows under the agreements now that he's just learned what he signed on to,
[11:04.520 --> 11:08.520]  that he didn't read, that it gave them more power than a president.
[11:08.520 --> 11:11.520]  In fact, that's what he said. He said, Pfizer has more power than the president.
[11:11.520 --> 11:14.520]  That was one of the quotes. Kind of a big deal.
[11:14.520 --> 11:19.520]  Now, that's endearing that Trump woke up and admits he got conned,
[11:19.520 --> 11:21.520]  but he's to come out fully against it.
[11:21.520 --> 11:26.520]  But this is so big, ladies and gentlemen, that we've got Mike Cernovich in the studio.
[11:26.520 --> 11:29.520]  So happy to have him here. We've got Tim Poole in the studio.
[11:29.520 --> 11:32.520]  It's going to be amazing today. I'm going to do all four hours.
[11:32.520 --> 11:35.520]  And I'm sure they're going to agree this is a big deal.
[11:35.520 --> 11:41.520]  I'm going to get their take on it, but do you understand this is all we should be talking about, this.
[11:41.520 --> 11:44.520]  And that's why the CEO of Pfizer goes on TV and says,
[11:44.520 --> 11:52.520]  I want laws passed to arrest anybody that criticizes Pfizer and the European Union and Canada and Australia
[11:52.520 --> 11:59.520]  and click their heels, the UK, click their heels and pass emergency laws.
[11:59.520 --> 12:06.520]  Well, how'd you pass emergency laws to arrest people that criticize lockdowns and forced injections
[12:06.520 --> 12:13.520]  in Croatia, in Austria, in Australia, in Spain,
[12:13.520 --> 12:16.520]  and the laws about the past are making it through parliament.
[12:16.520 --> 12:22.520]  So they just do an executive power in the UK. And this guy, like some supervillain,
[12:22.520 --> 12:25.520]  beams in to the Atlantic Council.
[12:25.520 --> 12:29.520]  We need to arrest the dark actors that are blocking us.
[12:29.520 --> 12:34.520]  And the man, the man goes, yes, of course, this should be illegal, arrest them.
[12:34.520 --> 12:38.520]  Oh, boy, I mean, it's on.
[12:38.520 --> 12:43.520]  So globalism is a project of getting traders into local government and national government
[12:43.520 --> 12:47.520]  and having them transfer all the power to international bodies.
[12:47.520 --> 12:51.520]  And the UN is only a segue into corporate fascism,
[12:51.520 --> 12:55.520]  and the corporations finally being in direct control of the planet.
[12:55.520 --> 12:59.520]  And that's been their goals, again, since they set up the UN.
[12:59.520 --> 13:02.520]  Hell, since they set up the League of Nations, it fell apart.
[13:02.520 --> 13:05.520]  So this is a hundred-plus-year-old project.
[13:05.520 --> 13:09.520]  It's over 100 years, like 104 years old now.
[13:09.520 --> 13:13.520]  Since it was officially a global project, I mean, it's really older than that, Cecil Rhodes,
[13:13.520 --> 13:16.520]  Random British Empire, and it's really his plan.
[13:16.520 --> 13:19.520]  And he wrote a bunch of books on it. You can go read them. I've read two of them.
[13:19.520 --> 13:21.520]  So this is a fact.
[13:21.520 --> 13:25.520]  And oh, by the way, this is a global government that wants you to have a beautiful planet
[13:25.520 --> 13:28.520]  and a world ID. We all can go wherever we want.
[13:28.520 --> 13:34.520]  You're going to be locked in your house and under a robot gunpoint, under a technocracy.
[13:34.520 --> 13:38.520]  So I want to show you these headlines for TV viewers. Radio listeners all read these for you.
[13:38.520 --> 13:43.520]  And listen, I'm not asking you. I'm telling you, please, for your children, for sanity,
[13:43.520 --> 13:47.520]  go read these articles, get this information, share it with folks,
[13:47.520 --> 13:53.520]  and then share the live feed of the show or take the archive of this when it's on Band-Aid video later today
[13:53.520 --> 13:58.520]  and download it and share it and re-upload it and make a big deal out of it.
[13:58.520 --> 14:05.520]  So here it is. FDA asked court for 55 years to fully release Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine data.
[14:05.520 --> 14:08.520]  They've just come out that they're killing people and they covered it up and they know it
[14:08.520 --> 14:13.520]  and we've got all the whistleblowers. So those people can be sued or even arrested
[14:13.520 --> 14:16.520]  if they tell you that they're killing you.
[14:16.520 --> 14:18.520]  Well, that sounds like something I want to take.
[14:18.520 --> 14:27.520]  Okay, so there it is. FDA asked federal judge to grant it total secrecy until the year 2076.
[14:27.520 --> 14:29.520]  It's not a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:29.520 --> 14:37.520]  Oh, then this little tidbit here revealed documents show Bill Gates gave 319 million
[14:37.520 --> 14:41.520]  to media outlets and that's only in one year in just a few countries.
[14:41.520 --> 14:46.520]  It's $4 billion in the last five years. That's why they do whatever he says.
[14:46.520 --> 14:51.520]  That's why he goes on TV, you know, like your dog, you feed and you snap your fingers
[14:51.520 --> 14:56.520]  and say sit to get a biscuit and he snaps his fingers and the media sits.
[14:56.520 --> 15:01.520]  He snaps his fingers and says, give children deadly shots and they push it because they're owned.
[15:01.520 --> 15:04.520]  And here it is. Now, when we come back, I'm going to hit the big news.
[15:04.520 --> 15:07.520]  Here it is, mainstream news, abc.net, that's Australia.
[15:07.520 --> 15:09.520]  Here it is out of the Washington Post.
[15:09.520 --> 15:11.520]  I mean, they've already told you this in your face.
[15:11.520 --> 15:17.520]  Pfizer has powered a silence, that's a quote, governments and maximized profits.
[15:17.520 --> 15:19.520]  Wow, you can silence governments.
[15:19.520 --> 15:22.520]  Yeah, like you silence U.S. senators when they criticize Pfizer.
[15:22.520 --> 15:26.520]  I'm not allowed to say that on the Senate floor. In secret vaccine contracts with governments,
[15:26.520 --> 15:29.520]  Pfizer took hard line to push profit.
[15:29.520 --> 15:32.520]  Not about profits, about control and power.
[15:32.520 --> 15:37.520]  Pfizer demands governments gamble with state assets to secure vaccine debt
[15:37.520 --> 15:40.520]  and sign over the nations to them in receivership.
[15:40.520 --> 15:44.520]  Like you go pay a bond when you're out of jail on a murder charge.
[15:44.520 --> 15:48.520]  Well, they have signed us onto this just like they had third world countries
[15:48.520 --> 15:51.520]  sign on the IMF and World Bank and be bankrupt forever.
[15:51.520 --> 15:53.520]  This is the change going on, baby.
[15:53.520 --> 15:57.520]  This is world corporate government that wants to kill you.
[15:57.520 --> 15:59.520]  If you're concerned about the...
[15:59.520 --> 16:06.520]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy bills.
[16:06.520 --> 16:12.520]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[16:12.520 --> 16:17.520]  Horrible crashes and, again, so many toxins on them.
[16:17.520 --> 16:25.520]  All of the new tropic products that we sell at infoatwarstore.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality

[17:06.520 --> 17:11.520]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data.
[17:11.520 --> 17:15.520]  And creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[17:15.520 --> 17:19.520]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[17:19.520 --> 17:25.520]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos,

[18:59.520 --> 19:04.520]  God created each and every one of us a free will.
[19:04.520 --> 19:08.520]  When we look at the world system now openly announcing the mark of the beast,
[19:08.520 --> 19:13.520]  everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free will
[19:13.520 --> 19:18.520]  and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies, our very productivity,
[19:18.520 --> 19:24.520]  our very genetics, our very future over to them.
[19:24.520 --> 19:29.520]  They want control of procreation. They want control of the relationships between men and women.
[19:29.520 --> 19:34.520]  They want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization.
[19:34.520 --> 19:40.520]  All of us were formed and made in God's mind and God's image and given free will.
[19:40.520 --> 19:46.520]  And make no mistake, all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special time
[19:46.520 --> 19:51.520]  so that you could make the right decision free will and stand against evil.
[19:51.520 --> 20:10.520]  And then for eternity win the great birthright prize of being in line with God.
[20:21.520 --> 20:32.520]  All right, so here's the big takeaway and this is the most important thing in the world
[20:32.520 --> 20:40.520]  that I'm about to say. The most important thing in your life,
[20:40.520 --> 20:49.520]  the most important thing in my life and every person on this planet.
[20:49.520 --> 20:54.520]  If you want to be free. This isn't just a political issue.
[20:54.520 --> 20:58.520]  This is an issue that is everything. This is the new type of war.
[20:58.520 --> 21:01.520]  This is globalism. This is their in-game plan.
[21:01.520 --> 21:05.520]  It's what they've been working on for 100 years.
[21:05.520 --> 21:10.520]  They wanted to establish world government and carry out depopulation over 100 years ago on record.
[21:10.520 --> 21:17.520]  Plato, the father of what you'd call philosophy, wanted to establish a empire
[21:17.520 --> 21:21.520]  and kill all the poor people too, not just Malthus 300 years ago,
[21:21.520 --> 21:24.520]  not just Galton 170 years ago.
[21:24.520 --> 21:29.520]  You don't know who Galton is. If you don't know who Cecil Rhodes is,
[21:29.520 --> 21:34.520]  if you don't know who Thomas Malthus was, if you don't know who Plato was,
[21:34.520 --> 21:40.520]  you need to learn because these are the governing controllers of your life.
[21:40.520 --> 21:43.520]  The most important thing spiritually is God. That's number one.
[21:43.520 --> 21:48.520]  But when it comes to this planet and the whole rest of your life,
[21:48.520 --> 21:54.520]  vaccine checkpoints, robots replacing humans, being injected with poisons till you die,
[21:54.520 --> 22:00.520]  total tyranny, reeducation camps, how do they sell those?
[22:00.520 --> 22:07.520]  Well, vaccine passports and checkpoints and taking people away to the, quote,
[22:07.520 --> 22:12.520]  internment facility for their safety. That's what this is. That's the plan.
[22:12.520 --> 22:16.520]  I told you 21 months ago, and this all started, that this was all going to be unfolding
[22:16.520 --> 22:19.520]  exactly as it has. And I told you then there'd be booster shots.
[22:19.520 --> 22:23.520]  And then they'd say, oh, you've got to take those.
[22:23.520 --> 22:26.520]  And then they're going to say, oh, we got to arrest all the people that won't take vaccines.
[22:26.520 --> 22:30.520]  They're the reason everybody keeps getting sick, even though these vaccines
[22:30.520 --> 22:35.520]  erase your immunity and make you sick on record.
[22:35.520 --> 22:41.520]  And they've got all the Dany State liberal police in all of Europe and Canada
[22:41.520 --> 22:44.520]  and Australia and New Zealand and the UK and in blue cities in the US
[22:44.520 --> 22:47.520]  that will put you in jail for life.
[22:47.520 --> 22:50.520]  They want to disappear you and your family.
[22:50.520 --> 22:56.520]  They are totally turned over to this.
[22:56.520 --> 22:59.520]  You understand, they'll do anything they're told.
[22:59.520 --> 23:03.520]  They'll beat women and children with clubs for going outside to the park
[23:03.520 --> 23:06.520]  when Fauci and Bill Gates created the virus and released it
[23:06.520 --> 23:12.520]  and now give you a vaccine that creates the virus in your body.
[23:12.520 --> 23:15.520]  And no matter how many people die, no matter how evil things get,
[23:15.520 --> 23:18.520]  they are yes men that have decided to follow orders
[23:18.520 --> 23:20.520]  and have decided to rationalize what they're doing.
[23:20.520 --> 23:25.520]  And so they are capable of anything.
[23:25.520 --> 23:27.520]  All right, let me make the big announcement.
[23:27.520 --> 23:30.520]  What is the big announcement?
[23:30.520 --> 23:35.520]  Just boil down for everyone so that we can get Rand Paul and Josh Hawley
[23:35.520 --> 23:37.520]  and Ted Cruz on board.
[23:37.520 --> 23:38.520]  They all know this.
[23:38.520 --> 23:41.520]  They all know that if they talk about this, the system comes after them.
[23:41.520 --> 23:44.520]  They won't just be getting shot at or their ribs broken.
[23:44.520 --> 23:46.520]  It'll be a lot worse.
[23:46.520 --> 23:48.520]  But we're all going to lose everything anyways
[23:48.520 --> 23:52.520]  if we don't call out the heart of the matter.
[23:52.520 --> 23:57.520]  The United States government, along with more than 50 other governments,
[23:57.520 --> 24:05.520]  signed an illegal treaty with Pfizer and the United Nations
[24:05.520 --> 24:10.520]  to put our countries into total receivership to them
[24:10.520 --> 24:15.520]  during the emergency if they would give us the drug to save us.
[24:15.520 --> 24:19.520]  Total censorship control, total secrecy of what's in it,
[24:19.520 --> 24:21.520]  total secrecy of what it does to people,
[24:21.520 --> 24:24.520]  allowed to lie, allowed to put out fake info,
[24:24.520 --> 24:26.520]  allowed to have anyone arrested they want,
[24:26.520 --> 24:28.520]  allowed to censor anybody they want,
[24:28.520 --> 24:31.520]  total global dictatorship.
[24:31.520 --> 24:33.520]  In fact, get clip 19 ready with Rand Paul.
[24:33.520 --> 24:36.520]  Rand Paul came out and said, Fauci is an authoritarian.
[24:36.520 --> 24:39.520]  And the way he casually talks about you have no personal rights
[24:39.520 --> 24:41.520]  is serious tyranny.
[24:41.520 --> 24:44.520]  Yeah, we're in an authoritarian state.
[24:44.520 --> 24:47.520]  The big Chinese dissident finally released, was on PBS,
[24:47.520 --> 24:50.520]  and they said, you know, isn't Trump an American authoritarian?
[24:50.520 --> 24:52.520]  And he goes, no, Trump is not an authoritarian.
[24:52.520 --> 24:54.520]  He doesn't have any power.
[24:54.520 --> 24:56.520]  The left is like Mao.
[24:56.520 --> 24:58.520]  They're taking over. You're in danger.
[24:58.520 --> 25:02.520]  And she's like, she has no idea,
[25:02.520 --> 25:05.520]  no idea that she's walking dead.
[25:05.520 --> 25:07.520]  No idea. I mean, folks, this is it.
[25:07.520 --> 25:10.520]  You understand? This is it.
[25:10.520 --> 25:12.520]  And we either man up and expose this
[25:12.520 --> 25:14.520]  and pull out of these illegal treaties
[25:14.520 --> 25:16.520]  and arrest these people, or it's over.
[25:16.520 --> 25:18.520]  Now, other people won't say that
[25:18.520 --> 25:20.520]  because they'll come after you.
[25:20.520 --> 25:23.520]  Listen, I'm not signing on to billions of dead people
[25:23.520 --> 25:25.520]  in my name.
[25:25.520 --> 25:27.520]  And all the fools that sit there
[25:27.520 --> 25:29.520]  into the middle gymnastics to say,
[25:29.520 --> 25:31.520]  I'm the bad guy for fighting these people,
[25:31.520 --> 25:33.520]  you're all going to see what happens
[25:33.520 --> 25:35.520]  if we're unable to stop this thing.
[25:35.520 --> 25:38.520]  And why wouldn't they go for broke?
[25:38.520 --> 25:40.520]  It lets them take over everything.
[25:40.520 --> 25:42.520]  It lets them depopulate everybody.
[25:42.520 --> 25:44.520]  It lets them collapse civilization and take all your money
[25:44.520 --> 25:46.520]  and everything through the medical system.
[25:46.520 --> 25:48.520]  It lets them phase out the majority of the population
[25:48.520 --> 25:50.520]  and roll forward with all the new technologies and systems
[25:50.520 --> 25:52.520]  and life extension for themselves.
[25:52.520 --> 25:54.520]  And then they just steal the whole future.
[25:54.520 --> 25:56.520]  And if you want your destiny stolen
[25:56.520 --> 25:58.520]  and you want your children's future stolen
[25:58.520 --> 26:00.520]  and all of this, then that's up to you.
[26:00.520 --> 26:02.520]  But this is real.
[26:02.520 --> 26:04.520]  And that's why they're fighting like the devil
[26:04.520 --> 26:06.520]  to keep us off the air.
[26:06.520 --> 26:08.520]  This is life and death.
[26:08.520 --> 26:10.520]  And I'm more than willing to be set up
[26:10.520 --> 26:12.520]  or put in prison or die.
[26:12.520 --> 26:14.520]  I'm not looking forward to it.
[26:14.520 --> 26:16.520]  I really don't like it.
[26:16.520 --> 26:18.520]  But I've got to do it.
[26:18.520 --> 26:20.520]  And I'm just telling you, I'm willing to hit the barbed wire.
[26:20.520 --> 26:22.520]  Because I knew what was coming.
[26:22.520 --> 26:24.520]  I knew. I tried to stop this.
[26:24.520 --> 26:26.520]  So, listen, look around at your family tonight
[26:26.520 --> 26:28.520]  because in eight years of their plan successful,
[26:28.520 --> 26:31.520]  those people are all going to be dead and so are you.
[26:31.520 --> 26:33.520]  You're dead.
[26:33.520 --> 26:35.520]  They're going to kill you.
[26:35.520 --> 26:37.520]  They're going to give you shot after shot after shot after shot
[26:37.520 --> 26:39.520]  until society collapses.
[26:39.520 --> 26:41.520]  And the people with Stockholm syndrome can't admit
[26:41.520 --> 26:43.520]  they're being killed because it's too scary.
[26:43.520 --> 26:45.520]  And so, they're going to go along with it.
[26:45.520 --> 26:47.520]  The argument is they deserve to die.
[26:47.520 --> 26:49.520]  And I'll be quite frank with you, okay?
[26:49.520 --> 26:51.520]  I could have gone with the New World Order.
[26:51.520 --> 26:53.520]  I didn't do it because spiritually I can't do it.
[26:53.520 --> 26:55.520]  But I understand it.
[26:55.520 --> 26:57.520]  Part of me wants to kill all these people that don't care about themselves.
[26:57.520 --> 26:59.520]  Okay, you know what? Fine, let's kill all of them.
[26:59.520 --> 27:01.520]  I'm going to go forward. I'm going to live.
[27:01.520 --> 27:03.520]  But I'm not signing on to that because I have an eternal soul
[27:03.520 --> 27:05.520]  and I will be cut off from God if I do that.
[27:05.520 --> 27:07.520]  But I totally know where Bill Gates
[27:07.520 --> 27:09.520]  and Prince Charles and all of them come from.
[27:09.520 --> 27:11.520]  I could be in league with them,
[27:11.520 --> 27:13.520]  100% be one of their generals.
[27:13.520 --> 27:15.520]  But I'm not, ladies and gentlemen,
[27:15.520 --> 27:17.520]  and that's what my enemies need to know,
[27:17.520 --> 27:19.520]  that they're on my level attacking me.
[27:19.520 --> 27:21.520]  You have no idea. You're fools.
[27:21.520 --> 27:23.520]  I am above
[27:23.520 --> 27:25.520]  and transcended above
[27:25.520 --> 27:27.520]  all this worldly crap.
[27:27.520 --> 27:29.520]  And I know you are as well, viewers and listeners,
[27:29.520 --> 27:31.520]  because you have Christ.
[27:31.520 --> 27:33.520]  But faith without works is dead.
[27:33.520 --> 27:35.520]  And Christ expects you to pick up the cross
[27:35.520 --> 27:37.520]  and follow Him.
[27:37.520 --> 27:39.520]  And that's what I have to do. And that doesn't mean
[27:39.520 --> 27:41.520]  I'm going to sit up here and be a cupcake.
[27:41.520 --> 27:43.520]  Mr. Sweetsy preacher who's all perfect
[27:43.520 --> 27:45.520]  and good and tells you about how big
[27:45.520 --> 27:47.520]  the center you are, I'm telling you
[27:47.520 --> 27:49.520]  God hates cowards.
[27:49.520 --> 27:51.520]  And if you won't stand up for our children,
[27:51.520 --> 27:53.520]  well then you deserve
[27:53.520 --> 27:55.520]  to die and you will.
[27:55.520 --> 27:57.520]  But very slowly first,
[27:57.520 --> 27:59.520]  they're going to have you give up everything you are
[27:59.520 --> 28:01.520]  on the social credit score and bow to them
[28:01.520 --> 28:03.520]  so you can just live a little longer
[28:03.520 --> 28:05.520]  as you're being trained
[28:05.520 --> 28:07.520]  by Satan to be a slave.
[28:07.520 --> 28:09.520]  So not me
[28:09.520 --> 28:11.520]  and not my family.
[28:11.520 --> 28:13.520]  We commit ourselves to war against these people.
[28:13.520 --> 28:15.520]  100% I pledge in front of God
[28:15.520 --> 28:17.520]  and His Son Jesus Christ
[28:17.520 --> 28:19.520]  absolute total commitment against this
[28:19.520 --> 28:21.520]  and I ask God to fill me
[28:21.520 --> 28:23.520]  with the Holy Spirit so that I can stand
[28:23.520 --> 28:25.520]  against this enemy and be effective in protecting innocent.
[28:25.520 --> 28:27.520]  I ask God
[28:27.520 --> 28:29.520]  to give me the strength and the will
[28:29.520 --> 28:31.520]  humbly to take on these people.
[28:35.520 --> 28:37.520]  Now,
[28:37.520 --> 28:39.520]  you need to ask God for guidance.
[28:39.520 --> 28:41.520]  You need to step into your destiny now.
[28:41.520 --> 28:43.520]  We're going to come back

[30:03.520 --> 30:05.520]  and said that people talking
[30:05.520 --> 30:07.520]  about the vaccines are working for
[30:07.520 --> 30:09.520]  quote dark forces
[30:09.520 --> 30:11.520]  that the FBI and CIA
[30:11.520 --> 30:13.520]  have been advising him
[30:13.520 --> 30:15.520]  on who these evil groups are.
[30:15.520 --> 30:17.520]  They know that all over the world
[30:17.520 --> 30:19.520]  their poison shot is being banned
[30:19.520 --> 30:21.520]  by major governments.
[30:21.520 --> 30:23.520]  And Moderna is in trouble as well.
[30:23.520 --> 30:25.520]  They know that the people are starting
[30:25.520 --> 30:27.520]  to get wise this depopulation agenda.
[30:27.520 --> 30:29.520]  In fact, evidence
[30:29.520 --> 30:31.520]  is starting to mount that the shots were
[30:31.520 --> 30:33.520]  supposed to be soft kill weapons
[30:33.520 --> 30:35.520]  so deadly they're killing
[30:35.520 --> 30:37.520]  a higher percentage up front
[30:37.520 --> 30:39.520]  and so people are waking up.
[30:39.520 --> 30:41.520]  The weapons work
[30:41.520 --> 30:43.520]  a little too good.
[30:43.520 --> 30:45.520]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars
[30:45.520 --> 30:47.520]  but instead they're making too big
[30:47.520 --> 30:49.520]  of a noise.
[30:49.520 --> 30:51.520]  But it's too late for them to turn back now.
[30:51.520 --> 30:53.520]  They're coming after our children.
[30:53.520 --> 30:55.520]  So it's up to us to protect our little children
[30:55.520 --> 30:57.520]  or God will not look favorably on us.
[30:57.520 --> 30:59.520]  Remember, God is watching.
[30:59.520 --> 31:01.520]  Cognitive dissonance
[31:01.520 --> 31:03.520]  is a major issue amongst the left.
[31:03.520 --> 31:05.520]  It can be very stressful
[31:05.520 --> 31:07.520]  dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[31:07.520 --> 31:09.520]  If you have a family member
[31:09.520 --> 31:11.520]  suffering from this degenerative
[31:11.520 --> 31:13.520]  mental condition, buy them
[31:13.520 --> 31:15.520]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil
[31:15.520 --> 31:17.520]  from InfowarsStore.com.
[31:17.520 --> 31:19.520]  Studies have suggested that
[31:19.520 --> 31:21.520]  fish oils and fish oil supplementation
[31:21.520 --> 31:23.520]  can slightly lower blood pressure,
[31:23.520 --> 31:25.520]  decrease triglyceride levels,
[31:25.520 --> 31:27.520]  decrease the growth rate of plaque
[31:27.520 --> 31:29.520]  and provide a soothing reduction
[31:29.520 --> 31:31.520]  in inflammatory responses
[31:31.520 --> 31:33.520]  in joints and the digestive system.
[31:33.520 --> 31:35.520]  Recent studies have suggested
[31:35.520 --> 31:37.520]  that high EPA and DHA
[31:37.520 --> 31:39.520]  fish oil can stimulate
[31:39.520 --> 31:41.520]  immune function by increasing
[31:41.520 --> 31:43.520]  the concentration and activity
[31:43.520 --> 31:45.520]  of immune cells.
[31:45.520 --> 31:47.520]  It worked for my family
[31:47.520 --> 31:49.520]  and now I can have a logical
[31:49.520 --> 31:51.520]  and calm discussion about actual facts
[31:51.520 --> 31:53.520]  that pertain to reality.
[31:53.520 --> 31:55.520]  Get your ultimate fish oil
[31:55.520 --> 31:57.520]  for a friend, family member or yourself
[31:57.520 --> 31:59.520]  at InfowarsStore.com
[32:27.520 --> 32:29.520]  It's not getting any circulation.
[32:29.520 --> 32:31.520]  It's not on the national news
[32:31.520 --> 32:33.520]  and it's very hard to even find
[32:33.520 --> 32:35.520]  on places like Instagram or Twitter.
[32:35.520 --> 32:37.520]  It's just crazy.
[32:37.520 --> 32:39.520]  And then Fauci was on TV just yesterday
[32:39.520 --> 32:41.520]  saying there's no damage from the vaccines.
[32:41.520 --> 32:43.520]  It doesn't hurt anybody.
[32:43.520 --> 32:45.520]  You're a conspiracy theorist if you say it.
[32:45.520 --> 32:47.520]  It's just crazy.
[32:47.520 --> 32:49.520]  And then we have all the scientists
[32:49.520 --> 32:51.520]  who over a year ago came out and said
[32:51.520 --> 32:53.520]  these vaccines are going to cause heart problems.
[32:53.520 --> 32:55.520]  They gave the exact reasons why
[32:55.520 --> 32:57.520]  they're on air. They get away with even more of this crap.
[32:57.520 --> 33:26.520]  This is just insane. These people are killers.
[33:27.520 --> 33:31.520]  Another world. Another time. Another time.
[33:31.520 --> 33:35.520]  His life was greed and greed.
[33:35.520 --> 33:37.520]  Kill of a crystal crack.
[33:37.520 --> 33:39.520]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[33:39.520 --> 33:41.520]  you are the Resistance.
[33:41.520 --> 33:43.520]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[33:43.520 --> 33:45.520]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[33:45.520 --> 33:47.520]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:47.520 --> 33:51.520]  Until the Atlantean crystal crack.
[33:51.520 --> 34:01.520]  The crystal crack.
[34:01.520 --> 34:07.520]  Power of their source.
[34:07.520 --> 34:09.520]  Learn about that from Plato too,
[34:09.520 --> 34:15.520]  but he wants to know what really is going on.
[34:15.520 --> 34:19.520]  When you can watch Netflix
[34:19.520 --> 34:22.520]  and learn how great pedophilia is
[34:22.520 --> 34:24.520]  by tuning in to CNN.
[34:24.520 --> 34:26.520]  Yeah, they're all over the news
[34:26.520 --> 34:28.520]  saying pedophilia is a good thing now.
[34:28.520 --> 34:30.520]  It's the big coming out.
[34:30.520 --> 34:33.520]  It's okay. They always wear like rainbow-colored glasses and stuff.
[34:33.520 --> 34:35.520]  So they're like clowns, you know?
[34:35.520 --> 34:40.520]  That's how they attract the little child into their web.
[34:40.520 --> 34:43.520]  Okay, listen, it really clicked for me last night
[34:43.520 --> 34:46.520]  and this morning
[34:46.520 --> 34:50.520]  when I began to just sit there and read
[34:50.520 --> 34:52.520]  Pfizer telling a federal judge,
[34:52.520 --> 34:54.520]  hey, we've got total agreements
[34:54.520 --> 34:56.520]  that we can tell the government what to do.
[34:56.520 --> 34:58.520]  Card launch. It's like a get out of jail free card.
[34:58.520 --> 35:00.520]  It's beyond immunity.
[35:00.520 --> 35:02.520]  It's they direct the federal government
[35:02.520 --> 35:04.520]  in all vaccine responses.
[35:04.520 --> 35:07.520]  And so Biden goes, okay,
[35:07.520 --> 35:10.520]  the CDC is now in control of all rents
[35:10.520 --> 35:12.520]  and we're going to be in control of all your bank accounts
[35:12.520 --> 35:14.520]  under the COVID emergency.
[35:14.520 --> 35:16.520]  Finally, a federal court said, no,
[35:16.520 --> 35:18.520]  you don't have that jurisdiction.
[35:18.520 --> 35:20.520]  We're not North Korea.
[35:20.520 --> 35:22.520]  But they're still pushing that
[35:22.520 --> 35:25.520]  because they are engaged in this criminal takeover.
[35:25.520 --> 35:29.520]  And if we don't say, hey, you're not allowed to sign a secret treaty
[35:29.520 --> 35:33.520]  with Pfizer and the UN to take over all aspects of the media
[35:33.520 --> 35:36.520]  and the government and be able to, quote, silence the government.
[35:36.520 --> 35:38.520]  That's in the agreement.
[35:38.520 --> 35:40.520]  I've got the articles right here.
[35:40.520 --> 35:42.520]  Just a Washington Post like, oh, they can silence the government.
[35:42.520 --> 35:44.520]  It's all about their money.
[35:44.520 --> 35:47.520]  They then distract off into the $70 billion.
[35:47.520 --> 35:50.520]  Pfizer's now made.
[35:50.520 --> 35:52.520]  That's just a side issue.
[35:52.520 --> 35:54.520]  These people issue and control the currency.
[35:54.520 --> 35:56.520]  It's a weapon they use.
[35:56.520 --> 35:58.520]  The tax code is social engineering.
[35:58.520 --> 36:00.520]  They admit that.
[36:00.520 --> 36:03.520]  So this is permanent martial law.
[36:03.520 --> 36:05.520]  This is the great reset.
[36:05.520 --> 36:08.520]  And now they tell you it's the permanent emergency.
[36:08.520 --> 36:10.520]  Chuck E. Schumer was on TV yesterday
[36:10.520 --> 36:12.520]  and I didn't play the clip.
[36:12.520 --> 36:14.520]  Dig it up, we will.
[36:14.520 --> 36:16.520]  But he's just like, hey, things are just going to get worse from global warming.
[36:16.520 --> 36:18.520]  More deadly viruses.
[36:18.520 --> 36:20.520]  Lockdown society is collapsing.
[36:20.520 --> 36:22.520]  It's just going to get worse.
[36:22.520 --> 36:24.520]  That's why they're telling everybody the world ends in 2030.
[36:24.520 --> 36:26.520]  The world ends.
[36:26.520 --> 36:28.520]  We're going to die.
[36:28.520 --> 36:30.520]  The viruses are going to come out of the jungle.
[36:30.520 --> 36:32.520]  They're not going to come out of the jungle, folks.
[36:32.520 --> 36:34.520]  They're going to come out of Fort Detrick
[36:34.520 --> 36:36.520]  and the University of Texas at Galveston
[36:36.520 --> 36:38.520]  and Chapel Hill, North Carolina
[36:38.520 --> 36:40.520]  and China.
[36:40.520 --> 36:42.520]  And so they're teaching children
[36:42.520 --> 36:44.520]  in public school all over the world
[36:44.520 --> 36:46.520]  that everybody's going to be dead in a few years.
[36:46.520 --> 36:48.520]  It's okay, though.
[36:48.520 --> 36:50.520]  The government's going to lock us down
[36:50.520 --> 36:52.520]  and maybe some of us will live.
[36:52.520 --> 36:54.520]  And then here it is.
[36:54.520 --> 36:56.520]  FDA
[36:56.520 --> 36:58.520]  asked court for 55 years
[36:58.520 --> 37:00.520]  to fully release
[37:00.520 --> 37:02.520]  Pfizer COVID-19 data.
[37:02.520 --> 37:04.520]  The epic times.
[37:04.520 --> 37:06.520]  The Food and Drug Administration asked a federal judge.
[37:06.520 --> 37:08.520]  Remember they said safe and approved,
[37:08.520 --> 37:10.520]  safe and effective in 2026.
[37:10.520 --> 37:12.520]  They've given the vaccine
[37:12.520 --> 37:14.520]  a corporate name
[37:14.520 --> 37:16.520]  and then they say
[37:16.520 --> 37:18.520]  it might be approved
[37:18.520 --> 37:20.520]  in 2026.
[37:20.520 --> 37:22.520]  And now they're like, well,
[37:22.520 --> 37:24.520]  about 2070 something.
[37:24.520 --> 37:26.520]  I'm not joking.
[37:28.520 --> 37:30.520]  So you see, I mean, this
[37:30.520 --> 37:32.520]  this is what it's like
[37:32.520 --> 37:34.520]  when you're in Poland in 1940
[37:34.520 --> 37:36.520]  and just suddenly Hitler invades
[37:36.520 --> 37:38.520]  and starts blowing everything up.
[37:38.520 --> 37:40.520]  Or
[37:40.520 --> 37:42.520]  you own a little
[37:42.520 --> 37:44.520]  shop and a business in 1950
[37:44.520 --> 37:46.520]  China and the communists have taken over.
[37:46.520 --> 37:48.520]  They just walk up and shoot your dad and mom in the head
[37:48.520 --> 37:50.520]  and take over your farm and start raping you.
[37:50.520 --> 37:52.520]  I mean, this is a takeover
[37:52.520 --> 37:54.520]  by bad people.
[37:54.520 --> 37:56.520]  And so many folks think, well, just run up a white flag
[37:56.520 --> 37:58.520]  and go along with them
[37:58.520 --> 38:00.520]  and they'll be nice to us.
[38:00.520 --> 38:02.520]  We just are reasonable.
[38:02.520 --> 38:04.520]  And it reminds me of
[38:04.520 --> 38:06.520]  the Road Warrior,
[38:06.520 --> 38:08.520]  a classic fiction film, but that's how
[38:08.520 --> 38:10.520]  the real world actually works in these warlord areas.
[38:10.520 --> 38:12.520]  And he comes up with
[38:12.520 --> 38:14.520]  members of their family they've captured tied up
[38:14.520 --> 38:16.520]  on the front of the vehicles and saying,
[38:16.520 --> 38:18.520]  listen,
[38:18.520 --> 38:20.520]  just open up the gates, let us in,
[38:20.520 --> 38:22.520]  let us have your big pump, let us have your oil well
[38:22.520 --> 38:24.520]  and we'll let you go.
[38:24.520 --> 38:26.520]  And they're like, no, don't do that.
[38:26.520 --> 38:28.520]  So they start killing them.
[38:28.520 --> 38:30.520]  And some of the people inside the fort
[38:30.520 --> 38:32.520]  say, humongous is a reasonable man.
[38:32.520 --> 38:34.520]  Come on, let's let him in.
[38:34.520 --> 38:36.520]  Because they just can't
[38:36.520 --> 38:38.520]  understand that they're going to have to fight
[38:38.520 --> 38:40.520]  or they're going to die.
[38:40.520 --> 38:42.520]  I mean, I'm sorry
[38:42.520 --> 38:44.520]  that's the way this is, okay?
[38:44.520 --> 38:46.520]  You think I want to go up against these people?
[38:46.520 --> 38:48.520]  But they're going up against me.
[38:48.520 --> 38:50.520]  And again, I'm not signing all of them.
[38:50.520 --> 38:52.520]  I had the Kissinger Group invite me
[38:52.520 --> 38:54.520]  to New York City to freaking meet with Henry Kissinger.
[38:54.520 --> 38:56.520]  Set it in front of my producer.
[38:56.520 --> 38:58.520]  And that's the only story I can tell you
[38:58.520 --> 39:00.520]  because they didn't say
[39:00.520 --> 39:02.520]  it's off the record.
[39:02.520 --> 39:04.520]  I've done off the record meetings with people.
[39:04.520 --> 39:06.520]  This is as real as
[39:06.520 --> 39:08.520]  the sun coming up in the morning
[39:08.520 --> 39:10.520]  and setting in the evening.
[39:10.520 --> 39:12.520]  And people act like this isn't happening
[39:12.520 --> 39:14.520]  and you're not even being empowered
[39:14.520 --> 39:16.520]  by these people.
[39:16.520 --> 39:18.520]  I mean, even if you were a psychopath,
[39:18.520 --> 39:20.520]  they're going to kill almost everybody.
[39:20.520 --> 39:22.520]  No matter how much you work for them
[39:22.520 --> 39:24.520]  or do what they want, they're going to get rid of you in the end
[39:24.520 --> 39:26.520]  because they don't want anybody around
[39:26.520 --> 39:28.520]  in the morning.
[39:28.520 --> 39:30.520]  This is an extremist plan
[39:30.520 --> 39:32.520]  to return the earth to the garden
[39:32.520 --> 39:34.520]  of Eden and Jeff Bezos' own words.
[39:34.520 --> 39:36.520]  And
[39:36.520 --> 39:38.520]  if you let these megalomaniacs
[39:38.520 --> 39:40.520]  take over,
[39:40.520 --> 39:46.520]  and Bill Gates is one of the chiefest
[39:46.520 --> 39:48.520]  of it, then you get what you deserve.
[39:48.520 --> 39:50.520]  But as for me and mine,
[39:50.520 --> 39:52.520]  we're not bowing down to this thing at one bit.
[39:52.520 --> 39:54.520]  And I'm going
[39:54.520 --> 39:55.520]  to tell you again, folks, here's the headlines. These headlines all together.
[39:55.520 --> 40:02.960]  headlines all together are incredible. FDA asked court for 55 years to fully
[40:02.960 --> 40:15.120]  release Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine data. Now here's the really important articles.
[40:15.120 --> 40:23.120]  Pfizer has power to quote silence governments. Let me say that again. Pfizer
[40:23.120 --> 40:31.880]  has power to silence governments and maximize profits consumer group
[40:31.880 --> 40:40.280]  alleges. They don't allege that. It says we have total liability protection and we
[40:40.280 --> 40:48.920]  will take over your government if you don't pay us or if you violate any
[40:48.920 --> 40:54.640]  clause of this. Your national parks are ours and your military bases are ours
[40:54.640 --> 40:59.720]  and all the US government patents are now owned by us. That's what it says. On
[40:59.720 --> 41:04.400]  record you can go read it. Just what the consumer groups have been able to get
[41:04.400 --> 41:08.200]  through lawsuits and through groups that have had the documents because you know
[41:08.200 --> 41:11.240]  that they go into court with these things say your honor please have everyone
[41:11.240 --> 41:14.680]  out of there this is classified information and then they here's the
[41:14.680 --> 41:21.440]  treaty we own the United States. This is just so incredible. So that's ABC news
[41:21.440 --> 41:25.440]  out of Australia. Here's another one. This is the Washington Post in secret. Oh
[41:25.440 --> 41:30.960]  in secret. Vaccine contracts with governments. Pfizer took hard line to
[41:30.960 --> 41:33.800]  push for profit. They make about profit. That's the red herring. We know
[41:33.800 --> 41:39.520]  because Brazil released the document. Bolsonaro released the document and now
[41:39.520 --> 41:43.040]  they want to kill him. The U.N. is calling for war crimes charges against him
[41:43.040 --> 41:46.000]  saying he's killing people not doing covid lockdowns when they're the ones
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.520]  that cooked it up and released it and run the whole thing and did the global
[41:48.520 --> 41:51.400]  lockdown that's killed over 25 million people starvation. They're looking at
[41:51.400 --> 41:54.720]  Bolsonaro saying we want him arrested. We want war crimes tribunal. They'll
[41:54.720 --> 41:58.760]  probably get him. All because he stood up against these people and got hydroxy
[41:58.760 --> 42:07.040]  chloroquine and things like ivermectin to the public and saw through them and
[42:07.040 --> 42:10.800]  then he released the documents where it said we will take control of all your
[42:10.800 --> 42:15.200]  government lands your military bases and we'll direct your government. Well
[42:15.200 --> 42:18.040]  that's how the IMF and World Bank do with African countries and Latin
[42:18.040 --> 42:20.240]  American countries where they come and say we'll give you a billion dollars
[42:20.240 --> 42:23.520]  just like 30 years ago and then oh you never paid the interest on it. Well you
[42:23.520 --> 42:26.560]  know it's 30 billion. Well we just get your roads your infrastructure
[42:26.560 --> 42:32.960]  everything is ours and that's it. So again Pfizer and then these big corporations
[42:32.960 --> 42:35.680]  put their people into all the government positions. They then had those
[42:35.680 --> 42:39.320]  government officials shine on to this illegal crap. They got Trump to go along
[42:39.320 --> 42:43.800]  with it. That's Trump's big downfall and now we're under it. So Trump can push his
[42:43.800 --> 42:48.880]  stupid vaccine all day but he better come out and say he got set up on this
[42:48.880 --> 42:53.960]  front. Okay we need to put his feet to the fire on this. This is an illegal

[47:01.080 --> 47:06.920]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:18.360 --> 47:24.240]  show the crew found two of the three videos that Trump put out a couple of
[47:24.240 --> 47:30.120]  months ago one on NBC one on Fox News another with Newsmax where he talks
[47:30.120 --> 47:34.120]  about wow Pfizer really got all this power and control they really got an
[47:34.120 --> 47:38.240]  incredible relationship with the governments and but they haven't found
[47:38.240 --> 47:41.160]  the clip because I know we played it where he says yeah they really got more
[47:41.160 --> 47:47.000]  power than a president does but we don't need to hear that from Trump we know
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.400]  that but we will play those clips here in a moment because we have the
[47:51.400 --> 47:56.280]  documents and I just read you the headlines in secret vaccine contracts
[47:56.280 --> 48:02.880]  with governments Pfizer took hard line to push for profit report says secret
[48:02.880 --> 48:11.520]  contracts Pfizer has the power to silence governments ABC News reports and
[48:11.520 --> 48:15.360]  then there's the full report by the whistleblower groups and it's really bad
[48:15.360 --> 48:21.000]  now Pfizer demands governments gamble with state assets to secure vaccine deal
[48:21.000 --> 48:29.280]  signed the state assets over mainstream news reporting this that's the secret
[48:29.280 --> 48:33.440]  contract Pfizer has been accused of bullying Latin American governments
[48:33.440 --> 48:37.080]  into COVID-19 vaccine negotiations and has asked some countries to put up
[48:37.080 --> 48:40.480]  sovereign assets such as the embassy buildings and military bases is
[48:40.480 --> 48:44.320]  guaranteed against the cost of any future legal action the Bureau of
[48:44.320 --> 48:52.120]  Investigative Journalism has revealed and it turns out the U.S. did that
[48:52.400 --> 48:56.800]  Pfizer accused of holding some countries ransom oh really yeah there's
[48:56.800 --> 49:02.960]  subsidiaries cooked up the virus and released it LA Times Pfizer U.S. signed
[49:02.960 --> 49:06.880]  five million dollar deal for 10 million treatment courses of their new COVID
[49:06.880 --> 49:14.520]  pill that's partially based on ivermectin wow and how did they get this done well
[49:14.520 --> 49:18.920]  Pfizer went around the world and lobbied with billions of dollars but a
[49:18.920 --> 49:28.320]  consortium of the Rockefeller Rothschild Gates Warren Buffett Oprah Winfrey gave
[49:28.320 --> 49:32.240]  hundreds of millions but but Buffett Gates have given over a hundred billion
[49:32.240 --> 49:36.480]  into a private consortium that then the Carnegie Endowment and the Ford
[49:36.480 --> 49:42.400]  Endowment and the Rockefeller Brothers Endowment put in hundreds of billions
[49:42.400 --> 49:46.240]  of dollars in fact the numbers not known Gates and Buffett it's up to 200
[49:46.240 --> 49:50.200]  billion but it's tax exempt money from their companies that they then reinvest
[49:50.200 --> 49:55.800]  in other companies they take over to control the world medical system Gates
[49:55.800 --> 50:00.080]  has been thrown out of over 30 countries including India for their vaccines
[50:00.080 --> 50:03.520]  killing people and and the Pfizer and Moderna shots are not authorized in
[50:03.520 --> 50:07.560]  China India you name it no one would ever take this in their right mind this is
[50:07.560 --> 50:13.520]  only for us the western countries who are being bombed with the bio weapon
[50:13.520 --> 50:19.480]  now now you understand that I sit here and have discussions with former head of
[50:19.480 --> 50:24.280]  defense intelligence and I'll leave it at that other military and intelligence
[50:24.280 --> 50:28.400]  folks that are patriots but but not just Flynn and we have straight up
[50:28.400 --> 50:31.360]  conversations about this and talk about this and agree that's what's going on
[50:31.360 --> 50:35.200]  interviewed Flynn aired it yesterday talking about the same thing this is
[50:35.200 --> 50:40.120]  real this is not this is not a comic book or in-game or Marvel stuff and you
[50:40.120 --> 50:43.760]  go eat popcorn and have milk duds and eat a hot dog you know it's everybody's
[50:43.760 --> 50:48.280]  battling in laser beams and everything you're being murdered okay got that
[50:48.280 --> 50:54.520]  okay so I'm asking you what are you gonna do about this now now Rand Paul
[50:54.520 --> 50:58.520]  finally getting there he's saying hey this is authoritarian this is tyranny
[50:58.520 --> 51:02.240]  this is bad this is and now you notice they're like oh they're booster shots
[51:02.240 --> 51:06.320]  they're being authorized and you got to take them and your children got to take
[51:06.320 --> 51:09.160]  them you know that's the same thing in Australia same thing in Israel say it's
[51:09.160 --> 51:16.520]  all coming here they're just further steps down the pit they're further down
[51:16.520 --> 51:22.640]  the hellhole and so we've got to get this information to Congress I don't want
[51:22.640 --> 51:26.120]  the attention I don't even want the credit for the people making a big deal
[51:26.120 --> 51:31.680]  out of this but we need to see OAN and Newsmax and and Tucker Carlson and
[51:31.680 --> 51:37.600]  everybody focused on this because this is the world government treaty this is
[51:37.600 --> 51:41.360]  the corporate illegal treaties agreements that are secret that are doing all
[51:41.360 --> 51:45.320]  this and we need Congress to stop putting up with the censorship and the
[51:45.320 --> 51:52.200]  control and everything but you see Congress knows the biggest spenders are
[51:52.200 --> 51:57.240]  big tech and big pharma they've bought off most of them and that's really what's
[51:57.240 --> 52:03.000]  going on here is that most of them I was reading like 87% of Congress takes big
[52:03.000 --> 52:08.400]  pharma money and big tech money and pull those numbers up they vary what's the
[52:08.400 --> 52:13.280]  high 70s low 80s in both demographics of big tech money versus pharma money
[52:13.280 --> 52:17.600]  which by the way those companies are all been merging for a decade at least so
[52:17.600 --> 52:22.600]  this is a big corporate one giant corporate world government monster who
[52:22.600 --> 52:28.000]  wants global government so it can then carry out depopulation so again if this
[52:28.000 --> 52:31.920]  was just a group taken over and they built better roads and you know we're
[52:31.920 --> 52:34.640]  better managers and everything we're into personal freedom I'm like well the
[52:34.640 --> 52:38.480]  world's coming together that's what this is not what they're doing they want us
[52:38.480 --> 52:43.040]  gone they see us as an infestation and I gotta tell you if you don't wake up and
[52:43.040 --> 52:47.440]  say out of this you deserve to die now I'm not saying that meanly but this is
[52:47.440 --> 52:54.400]  really a IQ test that's going on here's Senator Paul well alarming I mean
[52:54.400 --> 52:58.800]  alarming one that he has such casual disdain for individual liberty but if
[52:58.800 --> 53:03.280]  you combine that with also a casual disdain for science boy we got a real
[53:03.280 --> 53:07.640]  problem an authoritarian who also doesn't obey the science I mean look at
[53:07.640 --> 53:12.040]  this over a hundred million Americans have had COVID and if you ask the CDC
[53:12.040 --> 53:15.920]  well how do these people react the people have had COVID and recovered how
[53:15.920 --> 53:19.760]  often do they get sick again do they spread the disease very well oh we
[53:19.760 --> 53:24.200]  don't know we don't keep track of that can you imagine the guys in charge of
[53:24.200 --> 53:28.480]  this we pay him more than anybody in the government he has casual disdain for the
[53:28.480 --> 53:32.960]  Bill of Rights and your liberty but he's not keeping track he's like CNN ask him
[53:32.960 --> 53:36.400]  one day what do you think about natural he's like oh that's interesting we
[53:36.400 --> 53:41.040]  should look into that as if it was the first time he's ever heard of it he's a
[53:41.040 --> 53:44.960]  liar and he lies about the natural immunity he knows it works this is a
[53:44.960 --> 53:49.720]  recipe for totalitarianism it's a recipe for something we don't want in our
[53:49.720 --> 53:54.440]  country well I mean it's not a recipe they they they cook the dinner and we
[53:54.440 --> 53:58.880]  were what they cooked I mean they're attacking us like a tiger grabbing a
[53:58.880 --> 54:03.480]  deer in the forest and ripping its head off I mean the jaws are biting into our
[54:03.480 --> 54:09.560]  arteries right now I mean this is this is we had to stop playing patty cake but
[54:09.560 --> 54:13.200]  the globalists are real good at leaving the senators insulated and you know they
[54:13.200 --> 54:16.920]  go home and watch their Fox Sports and you know everything's okay
[54:16.920 --> 54:22.160]  meanwhile these people are hardcore killers all right a couple things here
[54:22.160 --> 54:26.280]  we got Mike Cernovich he's a really smart guy and I'm a big fan of his work
[54:26.280 --> 54:29.440]  he's gonna be joining us coming up the bottom of the next hour co-hosting for
[54:29.440 --> 54:33.440]  an hour and a half with us and then Tim Poole's coming into the fourth hour and
[54:33.440 --> 54:37.000]  I'll be co-hosting with him as well there's some more surprises and things
[54:37.000 --> 54:40.640]  coming up here in the next 48 hours on air and then Saturday there'll be some
[54:40.640 --> 54:44.480]  interesting things going on in them for worse but let me just make this
[54:44.480 --> 54:49.680]  completely clear to everybody they're not gonna get their full agenda through
[54:49.680 --> 54:55.600]  their full agenda is very expansive and and and they've bitten off more than they
[54:55.600 --> 54:59.000]  could chew but there are attempting it because they don't feel like there's
[54:59.000 --> 55:02.240]  any consequences and so why don't why shouldn't they just kill a bunch of
[55:02.240 --> 55:05.480]  people and get more money and power and then work towards their ultimate goal
[55:05.480 --> 55:09.440]  of killing 90% I don't think they're gonna get to that by 2030 but these are
[55:09.440 --> 55:13.280]  psychos that are in control of our lives sharing that show I just want to remind
[55:13.280 --> 55:19.680]  everybody that they're using serious psychological warfare programs developed
[55:19.680 --> 55:25.200]  by behavioral psychologists and tested out by the CIA and others for a long time
[55:25.200 --> 55:29.280]  against us but if you're aware of these tactics you can completely break free
[55:29.280 --> 55:33.760]  from it I instinctively did it without even researching all this you know 30
[55:33.760 --> 55:37.600]  years ago but in the last 20 plus I have researched it and nobody ever really
[55:37.600 --> 55:43.480]  gets into MK MK ultra MK Naomi documents and things like that part of what we're
[55:43.480 --> 55:47.880]  doing with reset wars that's gonna launch in the first week of December just
[55:47.880 --> 55:54.000]  coming up here in about a week and a half or so is we really dissect different
[55:54.000 --> 55:57.760]  schools of mind control and how they're being used and then just teach you basic
[55:57.760 --> 56:03.200]  tricks to really unlock yourself from the matrix and it's gonna be a course and
[56:03.200 --> 56:07.520]  it's gonna be one of many courses that are very well done and very powerful and

[58:51.960 --> 58:56.080]  basically I was 275 pounds I was overweight I had brain fog like you
[58:56.080 --> 59:00.320]  wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Grip on your
[59:00.320 --> 59:03.640]  show and I listened to it so the first one I got was the original survival
[59:03.640 --> 59:07.560]  shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out
[59:07.560 --> 59:10.920]  with that you know with a deep burn source you know and I got really excited
[59:10.920 --> 59:15.400]  about that so I took it and man in two weeks I went from brain fog to like
[59:15.400 --> 59:19.960]  literally like my brain was enlightened you know I could think again I could
[59:19.960 --> 59:24.360]  connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years I
[59:24.360 --> 59:27.880]  got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements
[59:27.880 --> 59:31.520]  there they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one I like recently is
[59:31.520 --> 59:35.200]  knockout it literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it
[59:35.200 --> 59:38.840]  works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean that's a break
[59:38.840 --> 59:42.800]  free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own
[59:42.800 --> 59:46.640]  help into our own hand beautifully said brother I thank you so much for your
[59:46.640 --> 59:58.760]  call and godspeed if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:34.360]  you know we've got some interesting call written house news and we've got the
[1:00:34.360 --> 1:00:38.720]  clip will play at her in a moment and yeah I knew about the 45 minutes ago and
[1:00:38.720 --> 1:00:42.880]  I didn't cover it I think calls really important I think in case for example for
[1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:47.240]  the right to self-defense but you understand we're under a global world
[1:00:47.240 --> 1:00:50.480]  government coup and the documents are out that our government was signed over
[1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:54.360]  by Trump to Pfizer and I understand that they would tear up executive orders
[1:00:54.360 --> 1:00:58.200]  Trump did and they put things in front of him and 40,000 page bills I don't
[1:00:58.200 --> 1:01:01.000]  blame Trump he's come out and talked about five just control over the
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.920]  government that you know it's not a good thing and said the booster shots are a
[1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:08.400]  scam for profit he's starting to eat around the edges of this but if he comes
[1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:14.320]  out and really starts getting in to Pfizer and and and how they have control
[1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:18.520]  of the government and then in these things then we got a real chance of
[1:01:18.520 --> 1:01:21.840]  Congress standing up and doing something but if we just elect a bunch of
[1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:26.920]  Republicans that do the same old thing then we're just given ourselves kind of
[1:01:26.920 --> 1:01:30.800]  a painkiller before we shoot ourselves it might as well just not take the painkiller
[1:01:30.800 --> 1:01:36.360]  gonna be dead anyways it's like this new governor in Virginia former head of the
[1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:40.240]  car law group that's a pretty evil globalist organization I looked at his
[1:01:40.240 --> 1:01:43.800]  past his background other than that he seems like a nice family man you know
[1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:48.800]  basketball player the rest of it looks like he was a front man at the fact we
[1:01:48.800 --> 1:01:53.280]  doesn't look like him and we know he was at the Stigial like Ted's on a board he
[1:01:53.280 --> 1:02:00.200]  they had two said CEOs so he was like a front man but that's just as bad if it
[1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:04.200]  was evil because it just means he does what he's told and so yeah he looks like
[1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:09.240]  it's just a front man you know a big seven foot tall front man and kind of
[1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:12.640]  toddling around and tell people you know that everything's fine he says he's
[1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:17.320]  gonna let the Democrats run mandates and terrorize kids with face mask and you
[1:02:17.320 --> 1:02:24.600]  have vaccine mandates in the cities so it's terrible so yeah there's been a big
[1:02:24.600 --> 1:02:28.240]  development in the written house case I'll cover it next segment where of
[1:02:28.240 --> 1:02:31.840]  course MSNBC is following the jurors around to their houses and harassing
[1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:38.320]  they've been banned from the building that's what the media does that's that
[1:02:38.320 --> 1:02:43.320]  I mean they lie so much I mean I've known they're big liars for a long time but I
[1:02:43.320 --> 1:02:49.680]  mean they really lie I mean I mean you understand folks in the default judgments
[1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:54.280]  against us in Texas and in Connecticut we gave them everything and they just say
[1:02:54.280 --> 1:03:00.800]  we did and then they defaulted Owen who was never subpoenaed or never even called
[1:03:00.800 --> 1:03:07.160]  I mean that's a separate person and they I mean that underlaw you just don't do
[1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:11.840]  that if you look if you walked into a court the judge says you're guilty you
[1:03:11.840 --> 1:03:15.800]  don't get a jury I am the queen of the earth you'd be like you're crazy person
[1:03:15.800 --> 1:03:22.840]  but they just do it now and so people asked me you know how I'm handling this
[1:03:22.840 --> 1:03:28.240]  and I mean everything's going to hell not not just people attacking us of
[1:03:28.240 --> 1:03:36.440]  course they're attacking us I mean Owen shroyer got a good lawyer is fighting
[1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:39.000]  they're trying to put him in jail for several years for being at the Capitol
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.760]  not even in it with us and the and the feds filed against our filing and said
[1:03:42.760 --> 1:03:47.800]  he's perjured himself he was not with Alex Jones that's security that day there
[1:03:47.800 --> 1:03:53.920]  was not for Owen and Owen knocked over barricades and trampled signs and the
[1:03:53.920 --> 1:03:57.880]  police told Owen to go but he didn't and then they source video that shows the
[1:03:57.880 --> 1:04:02.960]  opposite and you're sitting there reading federal filings saying we're lying
[1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:08.560]  and we have the damn video and people go to the URLs they link and they watch it
[1:04:08.560 --> 1:04:11.400]  it's on banned out video that's in the federal filings and you watch the
[1:04:11.400 --> 1:04:18.080]  opposite and you just ask yourself what is the exercise of lying like that well
[1:04:18.080 --> 1:04:24.000]  it's making him have a jury trial and if the judges act like he hadn't done
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:28.400]  something the judge will probably instruct the jury into convicting I mean
[1:04:28.400 --> 1:04:31.480]  the judge will probably not even let him show the video that's what I'm I mean
[1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:35.600]  the you see the written house judge that's a real judge and judges used to
[1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:38.760]  police to see him on court TV they all I could like that pretty much I've never
[1:04:38.760 --> 1:04:46.240]  seen stuff like this I mean this is crazy town folks total crazy town so Kyle's
[1:04:46.240 --> 1:04:50.200]  very important because if they're able to burn him they can burn everybody for
[1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:58.040]  themselves I'm just saying compared to everything else though I mean look info

[1:06:19.400 --> 1:06:30.600]  worldwide it's Alex Jones. A lot of folks that watch you on television ask why do
[1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:36.680]  you have a dagger and it's actually a reproduction of what they would use in
[1:06:36.680 --> 1:06:41.520]  the Middle Ages the Knights would have a several spike daggers they would have a
[1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:44.920]  hammer and you'd hammer it through once you got something off their horse you'd
[1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:48.440]  hammer it through their chest into their heart and so that's what that is it's a
[1:06:48.440 --> 1:06:52.600]  heart spike and it's a it's a human skull a real real skull my dad's a
[1:06:52.600 --> 1:06:57.880]  physician's my dad's skull they had medical school it's from India back when
[1:06:57.880 --> 1:07:01.280]  that was the one of their main exports was skeletons you know used to in
[1:07:01.280 --> 1:07:06.520]  classrooms it was real skeletons and then that those angel wings standard there
[1:07:06.520 --> 1:07:12.200]  what does that symbolize and if we can we'll put that back on screen to show
[1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:21.080]  some of the viewers out there what does that symbolize well I was in a cemetery
[1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:27.920]  for some of my ancestors that died in the Indian wars in the 1820s on a hill on
[1:07:27.920 --> 1:07:32.240]  the ranch next door to ours because we sold that property a long time ago to the
[1:07:32.240 --> 1:07:35.800]  neighbors family about 80 years ago but they let us go across the property of
[1:07:35.800 --> 1:07:42.640]  the hill to our cemetery and up there there was there's a I mean most of the
[1:07:42.640 --> 1:07:50.200]  stones have worn away but you can see a skull with wings on it and so I remember
[1:07:50.200 --> 1:07:55.000]  seeing that when I was a kid visiting that cemetery and like a third of the
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:01.240]  graves that you can read say you know killed by Indians it's pretty wild some
[1:08:01.240 --> 1:08:04.400]  some rough folks fighting the command she's pretty pretty cool you're like
[1:08:04.400 --> 1:08:07.680]  your ancestors you realize they were like fighting and dying just to carve out
[1:08:07.680 --> 1:08:11.480]  something and then and most the graves are under five-year-old dead children
[1:08:11.480 --> 1:08:14.680]  some of them killed by the peaceful Native Americans I'm not attacking Native
[1:08:14.680 --> 1:08:17.360]  Americans I'm part Native Americans just give me a break folks see a movie like
[1:08:17.360 --> 1:08:24.040]  the Revenant that's based on true story that's what's going on okay so I saw
[1:08:24.040 --> 1:08:32.200]  that carved on one of my ancestors graves and I thought I want to know what
[1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:35.640]  that means so I went to search engine did and sure enough it goes back over a
[1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:40.560]  thousand years in medieval Europe the symbol of you've died but your spirit
[1:08:40.560 --> 1:08:45.680]  is eternal it's a symbol of death and then transcending into the next
[1:08:45.680 --> 1:08:51.720]  dimension or transferring into another form of energy and so I thought that's
[1:08:51.720 --> 1:08:56.280]  really I think what my symbol should be I don't like that though because a lot of
[1:08:56.280 --> 1:08:59.160]  people that want to act like they're powerful and mean and stuff want to kind
[1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:02.120]  of use that they've expropriated that symbol like the hell's angels and I'm
[1:09:02.120 --> 1:09:05.200]  not attacking the hell's angels I'm just saying I don't have the skull and wings
[1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:09.080]  because you know we're death riding down the road or motorcycles the angel of
[1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:16.040]  death no none of this this meaning is about the transcendence of death and
[1:09:16.040 --> 1:09:20.120]  the fact that we are eternal beings that's what that symbol means and that's
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:24.080]  on my ancestors grave and I'm sure it's on many of my other ancestors graves in
[1:09:24.080 --> 1:09:28.760]  Europe but if you go to Europe and go to any really ancient graveyard that's on
[1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:34.080]  most of the tombstones that's the symbol and I think it's a very beautiful
[1:09:34.080 --> 1:09:38.840]  symbol I mean let me look at that that angel wings as the standard you're a
[1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:42.080]  Roman standard but it's an angel and then you've got the dagger you've got what
[1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:46.680]  the enemy threatens us with and in fact the death will come the daggers the
[1:09:46.680 --> 1:09:54.520]  angel of death and the skull is just a very beautiful remnant of our experience
[1:09:54.520 --> 1:10:00.160]  in this dimension and then you've got the transcendence and so that's what it is
[1:10:00.160 --> 1:10:03.960]  the dagger is the angel of death the skull represents humanity and our
[1:10:03.960 --> 1:10:07.960]  ancestors and the wings that we are connected to the internal and our
[1:10:07.960 --> 1:10:11.720]  eternal it's very beautiful and you know what I'm taking that as my symbol
[1:10:11.720 --> 1:10:18.120]  in full war symbol is the skull and wings that's our symbol that's the symbol
[1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:21.720]  that Holy Spirit tells me we're supposed to use and that's that is our symbol
[1:10:21.720 --> 1:10:27.240]  right there and that's what we stand for that's who we are we know there's an
[1:10:27.240 --> 1:10:31.080]  angel of death we know death's coming but we live through our ancestors and
[1:10:31.080 --> 1:10:34.400]  through our progeny in this dimension and we are eternal on the other planes
[1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:38.880]  and the enemy hates that because they know that's the truth and they want to
[1:10:38.880 --> 1:10:43.960]  try to bind us and enslave us and not let us realize who we really are and
[1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:50.760]  reset wars is all about exposing that and fighting that and saying no to that
[1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:55.520]  okay I got through some written house news here and it's important but I'm
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:11:02.880]  just gonna say this again if it sinks in that we have world government if it
[1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:08.160]  sinks in that it wants to kill us if it sinks in that Pfizer through the UN and
[1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:12.360]  a consortium of banks got governments in an emergency that they stage with Bill
[1:11:12.360 --> 1:11:18.280]  Gates and Fauci to give them power secretly over all of our governments to
[1:11:18.280 --> 1:11:23.640]  not just indemnify them but sign over the national parks and military bases to
[1:11:23.640 --> 1:11:27.320]  them and had the government sign on under a secret emergency declaration of
[1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:31.880]  martial law where it is that they have a medical
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:36.560]  tyranny and that's why whatever Pfizer says they want is then done and whenever
[1:11:36.560 --> 1:11:49.480]  Bill Gates says he's done like it was carved in stone and so that's the big
[1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:53.480]  issue everything else flows from that we are under a coup it's not the Chinese
[1:11:53.480 --> 1:11:59.920]  it's not the Russians it's the Hollywood basically the anti-christian
[1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:08.720]  globalist materialistic French Revolution 2.0 Bolshevik Revolution 2.0
[1:12:08.720 --> 1:12:15.720]  absolute cancer so that's really what it comes down to and I'm just gonna be
[1:12:15.720 --> 1:12:18.440]  hammering this and hammering this and hammering this and I know why the other
[1:12:18.440 --> 1:12:22.280]  leaders don't do it because you do this they come after you but you got to do
[1:12:22.280 --> 1:12:31.680]  this you got to do this don't you so let's get to the written house thing we
[1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:34.960]  know jurors are getting threatened it's all over the news there's all over online
[1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:39.680]  the media is trying to out who they are MSNBC is because they're a terrorist
[1:12:39.680 --> 1:12:44.160]  organization so that they can be terrorized and a lot of people are
[1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:47.680]  cowards and go ahead and convict written house it's not a good sign for
[1:12:47.680 --> 1:12:50.120]  written house I mean you look at it you think you should be found not guilty the
[1:12:50.120 --> 1:12:54.600]  fact they've been deliberating over a couple days is not good not good not it
[1:12:54.600 --> 1:12:58.320]  means they got people on that jury that are SJWs and they want to sing call the
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:02.760]  prison that's gonna get overturned on appeal because they cheated so much to
[1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:07.040]  do this but it's amazing so the judge the police caught MSNBC following under
[1:13:07.040 --> 1:13:10.880]  their houses and the guy that got arrested by the police said hey I was
[1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:15.560]  told to do this well that's okay then you know just following orders and so now
[1:13:15.560 --> 1:13:23.680]  they're barred from the courthouse here it is a person who identified himself as
[1:13:23.680 --> 1:13:30.240]  James James Morrison and who claimed that he was a producer with NBC News
[1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:45.160]  employed for MSNBC and under the supervision of a person what's going on oh
[1:13:45.160 --> 1:13:54.120]  under the supervision of someone named Irene Bayon in New York for MSNBC the
[1:13:54.120 --> 1:13:58.800]  police when they stopped him because he was following in a distance of about a
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:05.120]  block and went through a red light hold him over and inquired of him what was
[1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:11.160]  going on and he gave that information and stated that he had been instructed by
[1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:20.880]  Ms. Bayon in New York to follow the jury buzz the matter is under further
[1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:26.720]  investigation at this point and the media has asked questions about it that's
[1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:34.560]  the latest I have and he was ticketed for violating a
[1:14:34.560 --> 1:14:42.800]  pepper control signal he's not here today from what I'm told and I have
[1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:48.440]  instructed that no one from MSNBC News will be permitted in this building for
[1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:54.040]  the duration of this trial this is a very serious matter and I don't know what
[1:14:54.040 --> 1:15:00.760]  the ultimate truth of it is but absolutely it would go without much
[1:15:00.760 --> 1:15:08.400]  thinking that someone who is following us the jury bus that is a very it's
[1:15:08.400 --> 1:15:15.680]  extremely serious matter and he's going on to say what the whole media is doing
[1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:20.280]  is extremely scary yesterday and again the president of the United States that
[1:15:20.280 --> 1:15:24.000]  written house is a white supremacist because he didn't want them burning down
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:30.720]  his dad's house and business you have an instinct to hey people are trying to
[1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:33.360]  burn down my dad's business and burn you know they're burning stuff down two

[1:18:57.040 --> 1:19:03.120]  the globalist are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and
[1:19:03.120 --> 1:19:07.400]  with poisons and chemicals added to the foods it's all come out and they're
[1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:11.040]  doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of God the
[1:19:11.040 --> 1:19:17.280]  creator and we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much so
[1:19:17.280 --> 1:19:20.920]  that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came
[1:19:20.920 --> 1:19:27.720]  up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not be necessary if the
[1:19:27.720 --> 1:19:32.960]  situation was hopeless they need all their propaganda and all their lies and
[1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:39.080]  all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong
[1:19:39.080 --> 1:19:43.520]  and they know in the end they signed on the God of this world who is a loser and
[1:19:43.520 --> 1:19:46.320]  that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars on the air now
[1:19:46.320 --> 1:19:50.320]  more than ever because even you don't believe in God what the globalist are
[1:19:50.320 --> 1:19:55.280]  manifesting setting up and we are opposing the one-world government and
[1:19:55.280 --> 1:19:58.720]  the mark of the beast they just announced
[1:19:58.720 --> 1:20:05.760]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:20:28.720 --> 1:20:39.960]  I'm bound to keep on the ride I got one more silver dollar
[1:20:39.960 --> 1:20:46.360]  I ain't gonna let them catch me no I ain't gonna let them catch me tonight
[1:20:46.360 --> 1:20:51.880]  good ol' Wayland Jennings bringing us in
[1:20:51.880 --> 1:21:09.320]  though they're not gonna catch me not gonna catch me the midnight rider
[1:21:09.320 --> 1:21:14.520]  all right folks turn of this is gonna be in here middle of the next segment run
[1:21:14.520 --> 1:21:16.960]  a little bit late but with us for about an hour and a half the temple's gonna be
[1:21:16.960 --> 1:21:25.720]  in studio with us as well let me just say this I want to thank the listeners who
[1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:28.880]  have been supporting us over the years buying the products writing the word
[1:21:28.880 --> 1:21:33.120]  I really you've helped forge the tip of the spear in the fight and it's not
[1:21:33.120 --> 1:21:36.280]  about bragging it's about recognizing your accomplishments and our
[1:21:36.280 --> 1:21:39.720]  accomplishments and this crew's accomplishments and what we've done
[1:21:39.720 --> 1:21:42.880]  here so you we've definitely given the globalist to run with their money
[1:21:42.880 --> 1:21:46.640]  they're in a lot of trouble because of us they actually would like to kill me
[1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:50.160]  obviously but they don't want to turn me into a martyr but they're thinking about
[1:21:50.160 --> 1:21:56.920]  it and so this is a very historic time to be alive right now and we need to stay
[1:21:56.920 --> 1:22:02.160]  on air and they have had the Democratic Party funded groups the same law firm
[1:22:02.160 --> 1:22:07.320]  that sued Remington into bankruptcy the oldest gun company in America that
[1:22:07.320 --> 1:22:12.800]  mainly supplies our military bankrupted them with their suits and the kangaroo
[1:22:12.800 --> 1:22:16.240]  courts and everything that's what they do when they know how to pick the court
[1:22:16.240 --> 1:22:21.400]  and the people and that's that's how you railroad the country to hell so I'm
[1:22:21.400 --> 1:22:26.840]  very honored to have the worst snakes in this country coming after me and then
[1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:33.760]  wrapping themselves you know in in in the identity of dead children trying to
[1:22:33.760 --> 1:22:38.880]  then silence the First Amendment in that process and of course they couldn't
[1:22:38.880 --> 1:22:43.280]  have a jury trial because we'd actually show what really went on and what we
[1:22:43.280 --> 1:22:52.400]  really said and they know we convinced a jury they know that a jury guaranteed
[1:22:52.400 --> 1:22:56.280]  at least a minority of them would think it was the First Amendment right to ask
[1:22:56.280 --> 1:23:02.840]  questions and that what they'd said I'd done I didn't do and so in the deposition
[1:23:02.840 --> 1:23:05.880]  and all the rest of it we never got to depose anybody in Texas they just got
[1:23:05.880 --> 1:23:08.600]  to depose us for years and get all our documents and everything and then say
[1:23:08.600 --> 1:23:12.960]  you know we say we gave them nothing we got nothing from them we were starting
[1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:18.720]  to get around to that though and they couldn't have that and so now the judge
[1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:24.240]  is saying no you don't get to depose anybody but we're gonna keep posing you
[1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:28.360]  because you're defaulted oh really I'm defaulted I don't have any rights but
[1:23:28.360 --> 1:23:32.240]  you can keep harassing me and then a jury will decide how guilty we are and
[1:23:32.240 --> 1:23:36.040]  they hope to get a big enough judgment to try to shut info wars down and that's
[1:23:36.040 --> 1:23:45.040]  their admitted goal that's what these people have said to our faces and so
[1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:52.360]  understand that I'm not a gun manufacturing company you see I've got a
[1:23:52.360 --> 1:23:55.560]  voice and I've got a right to speech even if people say I don't and they're
[1:23:55.560 --> 1:24:01.960]  not going to shut anything down in fact I pledge that I'm launching two new
[1:24:01.960 --> 1:24:07.600]  shows that I will do religiously and I'm gonna write books and I'm making
[1:24:07.600 --> 1:24:10.920]  films as you've already seen again and launching a bunch of big projects not
[1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:14.840]  because these people are attacking me but because it's what I'm supposed to do
[1:24:14.840 --> 1:24:19.240]  in this historic time evidence by the whole system pulling out the stops and
[1:24:19.240 --> 1:24:23.160]  erasing due process and doing all this horrible stuff to try to put us under the
[1:24:23.160 --> 1:24:26.760]  jail I mean Owen shroyer went with us the Capitol tried to stop what was
[1:24:26.760 --> 1:24:30.760]  happening and they did federal filing saying he broke barricades and attack
[1:24:30.760 --> 1:24:35.320]  people and even though we have all the video the opposite show so Owen's you
[1:24:35.320 --> 1:24:41.320]  know needs your prayers more than I do but they've been trying to indict us
[1:24:41.320 --> 1:24:44.440]  for January 6th and a bunch of other stuff they just think well we've got
[1:24:44.440 --> 1:24:48.400]  Jones trying to stop it and we've got you know we've got all his records and
[1:24:48.400 --> 1:24:52.840]  you know such as such and we've subpoenaed everything and Jones didn't do
[1:24:52.840 --> 1:24:57.240]  anything everything Jones says is true so what do we do well let's just indict
[1:24:57.240 --> 1:25:06.960]  his co-host so this is just next level and so I want to explain something we
[1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:11.040]  have six trials currently with all the different lawsuits the Sandy Hook the
[1:25:11.040 --> 1:25:16.440]  Virginia thing all of that that all starts in March of next year in four
[1:25:16.440 --> 1:25:20.880]  months and runs all the way into September in Connecticut it'll be on
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:27.040]  TV three-ring circus HBO all of them televised and if I don't show up once
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:30.200]  a peanut they'll put me in jail so I've got to come in there and be pilloried
[1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:34.320]  and attacked and lied about and not be able to defend myself and and you know
[1:25:34.320 --> 1:25:40.640]  I mean the whole thing's rigged that's okay because they expected us to either
[1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:46.640]  declare bankruptcy years ago or just go away or or or not show up to this
[1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:49.400]  thing that's why they had to do the default because they can't actually
[1:25:49.400 --> 1:25:53.320]  face us where we have the Bill of Rights Constitution they'll lose for sure we
[1:25:53.320 --> 1:25:56.840]  by the way they know we did focus groups in Texas and Connecticut they know
[1:25:56.840 --> 1:26:02.000]  that the focus groups when shown this all multiple ones per state found that I
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:06.400]  was absolutely within my rights and that and that they actually got mad at the
[1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:09.000]  lawyers and the families the focus groups did when they learned that they'd
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:12.440]  already gotten hundreds of millions of dollars in Bloomberg and all this stuff
[1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:16.720]  and the types of charities and so they can't do that this is just the Democratic
[1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:23.560]  Party wrapping themselves in these sad little dead children and then mad at me
[1:26:23.560 --> 1:26:26.960]  that I questioned the public event that had major anomalies I mean most these
[1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:32.720]  big events are not to be fake like Jesse Smollett or the Roe v. Wavy Roe v. Wade
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:38.600]  baby wasn't killed or Gulf of Tonkin so it has cost us millions and millions of
[1:26:38.600 --> 1:26:44.080]  dollars to fight these and going to trial is very very very expensive I mean
[1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:48.120]  just my custody battle with my ex-wife five years ago that was all over the news
[1:26:48.120 --> 1:26:53.520]  had over a hundred reporters that at any one time that cost me three hundred
[1:26:53.520 --> 1:26:57.400]  thousand dollars and I mean I had basically no money in the bank after
[1:26:57.400 --> 1:27:01.040]  that I'm not complaining it's just that we need money to operate here and so it's
[1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:06.760]  gonna cost millions of dollars to fight six lawsuits oh yeah there's a four
[1:27:06.760 --> 1:27:10.680]  Sandy Hook ones and then two others and they're just gonna have circus trial at
[1:27:10.680 --> 1:27:16.160]  their circus trial after circus trial to just bring up dead kids by hijacking the
[1:27:16.160 --> 1:27:19.920]  narrative of Alex Jones they attached to me the gun control lobbies attached to
[1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:22.960]  us and then claim we're attached to them and then we're getting famous and
[1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:26.920]  getting money off them when it's the opposite so it's an inversion of reality
[1:27:26.920 --> 1:27:32.440]  yet again so we raised one 20th of the money I want to raise and that's that's
[1:27:32.440 --> 1:27:37.320]  great I want to thank folks that gave a hundred and two thousand dollars at give
[1:27:37.320 --> 1:27:42.480]  send go who are patriots and if you want to raise money whatever it is you're
[1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:45.240]  doing and you're a conservative or Christian and you've been discriminated
[1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:51.280]  against and you've not been able to you know go out and raise money hey give

[1:28:30.280 --> 1:28:33.440]  judge that works for them they go in and then they just stage a fake trial and

[1:31:19.280 --> 1:31:23.440]  emerge it is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must
[1:31:23.440 --> 1:31:30.280]  cover a disease criminal faces from the light of the sun it is the symbol of
[1:31:30.280 --> 1:31:38.000]  our complete and total absolute surrender to evil ladies and gentlemen we
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:43.440]  are crossing the Rubicon now the entire future destiny of humanity is upon us
[1:31:43.440 --> 1:31:47.000]  claus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips
[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:51.840]  as part of the world ID and carbon taxes things only get worse from here if we
[1:31:51.840 --> 1:31:57.400]  submit they only get better if we resist and say no non-compliance non-compliance
[1:31:57.400 --> 1:32:03.680]  non-compliance in late August info war saw an explosion of orders because our
[1:32:03.680 --> 1:32:09.040]  audience understands that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design
[1:32:09.040 --> 1:32:14.800]  and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide now

[1:32:59.720 --> 1:33:04.960]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:33:10.520 --> 1:33:15.800]  there are of course those who do not want us to speak just let me think even
[1:33:15.800 --> 1:33:20.320]  now orders are being shouted to telephones and men with guns are supposed to be on
[1:33:20.320 --> 1:33:26.040]  their way. It's Chancellor Sutton. Damn it. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of
[1:33:26.040 --> 1:33:31.800]  conversation words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to
[1:33:31.800 --> 1:33:41.280]  meaning and for those who will listen the annunciation of truth. The truth is there is something terribly wrong with this country isn't there?
[1:33:41.280 --> 1:33:44.400]  You designed it sir you wanted it foolproof you told me every television in
[1:33:44.400 --> 1:33:49.520]  London. Cruelty and injustice and tolerance and oppression and where once you had the
[1:33:49.520 --> 1:33:54.240]  freedom to object to the thing can speak as you saw fit you now have senses and
[1:33:54.240 --> 1:33:57.240]  systems of surveillance perversing your conformity and
[1:33:57.240 --> 1:34:03.640]  suppression. We need cameras. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Certainly there are
[1:34:03.640 --> 1:34:07.960]  those who are more responsible than others they will be held accountable but
[1:34:07.960 --> 1:34:12.840]  again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a
[1:34:12.840 --> 1:34:23.440]  mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems
[1:34:23.440 --> 1:34:29.080]  inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the
[1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:35.120]  best of you and in your panic you turned to the now high Chancellor Adam Sutton. He promised
[1:34:35.120 --> 1:34:39.520]  you order he promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent
[1:34:39.520 --> 1:34:43.040]  obedient consent.
[1:34:46.760 --> 1:34:53.920]  There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity. The time
[1:34:53.920 --> 1:35:01.680]  to choose sides has come. We are the resistance. We are the Info War.
[1:35:01.680 --> 1:35:10.280]  You know what Mark Zuckerberg's doing? It came out more than five years ago in
[1:35:10.280 --> 1:35:14.800]  his own company documents when whistleblowers warned the world that he
[1:35:14.800 --> 1:35:19.080]  was trying to isolate people to be only on Facebook and to be depressed and
[1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:23.840]  alone so that avatars or fake computer entities would be their only friends
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:29.400]  thus taking full control of the user's mind. That's just a beta test for what's
[1:35:29.400 --> 1:35:35.000]  now rolling out with Facebook claiming ownership of the metaverse and buying up
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:40.440]  hundreds of VR companies and now trying to force its users and employees to
[1:35:40.440 --> 1:35:46.080]  solely live in a fantasy world controlled and orchestrated by Zuckerberg and the
[1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:50.960]  organizations that he works with. This priest class wants to lock us in our
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:54.720]  five senses here in the third dimension and to do that they're creating an
[1:35:54.720 --> 1:36:02.640]  artificial electronic prison or matrix to seduce us into giving up control of
[1:36:02.640 --> 1:36:08.320]  our bodies and our minds. This is the greatest deception ever. Evil is digging
[1:36:08.320 --> 1:36:12.680]  in because it knows humanity is waking up and that group consciousness is
[1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:17.800]  forming and that we are beginning to transcend the third dimension. Everything
[1:36:17.800 --> 1:36:21.720]  that's being launched against us is an attempt to hold us in the third
[1:36:21.720 --> 1:36:26.280]  dimension and not just enslave us but finally completely destroy us and
[1:36:26.280 --> 1:36:31.520]  absorb our energy into this system they're building. This is beyond the
[1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:35.280]  Satanic ritual. This is beyond anything you've read about in science fiction
[1:36:35.280 --> 1:36:39.800]  because this is actually happening in the real world today and we have
[1:36:39.800 --> 1:36:43.480]  discovered their secrets. We've discovered how to stop them and we have
[1:36:43.480 --> 1:36:47.760]  put it all together in an easy to understand system that gives you the
[1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:52.840]  tools to not just defeat the globalists but to transcend to the next level. It's
[1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:56.920]  so important for all of you that already know this innately and have already
[1:36:56.920 --> 1:37:00.360]  witnessed this for yourselves to understand you are the leaders of the
[1:37:00.360 --> 1:37:05.040]  future that must go to the next level so that you and I and others working
[1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:09.280]  together can free the rest of humanity before they get trapped in this
[1:37:09.280 --> 1:37:12.840]  artificial matrix system the globalists are building. All I'm offering is the
[1:37:12.840 --> 1:37:16.880]  truth. The film The Matrix made in 1999 is not original. Documents came out in
[1:37:16.880 --> 1:37:22.840]  1990 from the late 1970s where NASA and DARPA were developing a plan very
[1:37:22.840 --> 1:37:27.440]  similar to The Matrix and all that information is now public. They were
[1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:32.680]  attempting to seduce us to give up our five senses not just holding us a third
[1:37:32.680 --> 1:37:36.600]  dimension but actually creating an artificial slave system so that they
[1:37:36.600 --> 1:37:41.920]  can turn us into their programmable slaves. Humanity are not robots no matter
[1:37:41.920 --> 1:37:45.760]  how many times Ray Kurzweil and the social engineers tell us this but they
[1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:51.280]  are trying to turn us into robots. That's why in December of 2021 we are
[1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:58.000]  launching Reset Wars. Find out more information at resetwars.com
[1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:10.560]  Well I've been trying to get him in studio with us for a while and he's done
[1:38:10.560 --> 1:38:16.080]  it. Mike Cernovich, an old friend of mine Cernovich.com author researcher. He had
[1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:22.480]  a number one film as well. Hoax went to the top of Amazon again Mike Cernovich
[1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:25.600]  is a lawyer author free speech activist and documentary filmmaker featured film
[1:38:25.600 --> 1:38:32.280]  free speech silenced a producer unconvention. Yeah, Hoax is excellent.
[1:38:32.280 --> 1:38:35.320]  Absolutely.
[1:38:35.320 --> 1:38:40.360]  iTunes for the year and it was two weeks in a row top-selling independent film
[1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:46.640]  right there was Uncut Gems 29 million dollar budget Uncut Gems and then Hoax
[1:38:46.640 --> 1:38:51.280]  that's how that's how good it did with no with no real you know traditional
[1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:54.720]  promotion right that's how many people are out there really and I saw you I saw
[1:38:54.720 --> 1:39:00.200]  a rough cut of Alex's war amazing the one the new film coming out about you I
[1:39:00.200 --> 1:39:03.440]  don't know if you've watched that I have a rule I don't watch things I mean God it's
[1:39:03.440 --> 1:39:08.440]  so good even hoax you know it hit number one yeah even Shawna who's not very
[1:39:08.440 --> 1:39:12.760]  political my wife was like this is really good filmmaking so Alex's war I'm
[1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:18.280]  really excited for whenever that comes out it's a very it's a biop so I noticed
[1:39:18.280 --> 1:39:23.200]  in why the lefts films are terrible and Norm McDonald did a segment on why
[1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:28.040]  Alec Baldwin isn't funny when he talks about Trump and that's when it registered
[1:39:28.040 --> 1:39:34.080]  on my mind the only way to do a good film about a subject is to let the subject
[1:39:34.080 --> 1:39:38.640]  express who they are and the left doesn't want to let us do that about ourselves
[1:39:38.640 --> 1:39:42.480]  so they try to caricature us and then even the left doesn't want to watch it
[1:39:42.480 --> 1:39:47.040]  because they go this is a dumb film this is stupid it's not it's not it's not
[1:39:47.040 --> 1:39:50.720]  reality so it's not entertaining yeah it's just stupid so the only way to make a
[1:39:50.720 --> 1:39:54.840]  real film about us is to show who we really are but if you show who you
[1:39:54.840 --> 1:39:58.320]  really are then more and more people like us so they're caught in this terrible
[1:39:58.320 --> 1:40:03.200]  catch-22 of filmmaking whereas I can't even read the articles about myself not
[1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:08.320]  because oh I'm so sad they're they're being mean to me but because it's dumb
[1:40:08.320 --> 1:40:12.600]  it's stupid the same thing that when I try to read stuff about you so what I
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:18.440]  like about Alex's war the film about you coming out is it isn't Alex Jones
[1:40:18.440 --> 1:40:21.760]  propaganda it isn't Alex Jones is the greatest man who ever walks the earth
[1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:26.400]  that is this who is who he is this is the character arc this is the story arc
[1:40:26.400 --> 1:40:30.320]  this is where he began this is where he is now this is the part that he's at
[1:40:30.320 --> 1:40:34.240]  at the hero's journey and where you know where is it gonna end we don't know
[1:40:34.240 --> 1:40:38.360]  because of course you're in a different character arc in your own life because
[1:40:38.360 --> 1:40:42.880]  even though you've done so much there's now a seminal point in your life a
[1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:47.080]  seminal conflict in your life where act 3 is actually beginning in your film so
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:52.880]  as much as you've done you're now moving into act 3 which for me as a
[1:40:52.880 --> 1:40:58.320]  storyteller filmmaker and fan of the arts I enjoy even though personally I
[1:40:58.320 --> 1:41:02.480]  feel that you've been horribly mistreated so I'm on this contradictory
[1:41:02.480 --> 1:41:07.480]  position in my life where personally I don't like what's happened to you or
[1:41:07.480 --> 1:41:14.440]  banning James O'Keefe project Veritas me but then I think artistically it's the
[1:41:14.440 --> 1:41:18.680]  greatest art that we've ever witnessed in our life it's real life this is like
[1:41:18.680 --> 1:41:24.520]  Greek tragedy stuff this is real good guys bad guys even good versus evil the
[1:41:24.520 --> 1:41:29.000]  character arcs of people the evil forces are marshaling against the forces of
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:34.040]  good they're trying to attack anyone who speaks out in favor of God is
[1:41:34.040 --> 1:41:39.000]  anti-christian now full-on anti-christian that can't really be denied and I'm
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:43.560]  enthralled by the stories of the people this interesting so I try to take a
[1:41:43.560 --> 1:41:50.440]  step back even for my own self and not even look at my emotions or how I feel
[1:41:50.440 --> 1:41:56.560]  about a given situation and I zoom out and think what an incredible and I'd be
[1:41:56.560 --> 1:42:00.080]  careful because I don't want to maybe summon more tragedy on us but I'll just
[1:42:00.080 --> 1:42:05.000]  say what an incredible life God has led us to lead if you view it that way this
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:09.280]  is definitely a grand adventure yeah the God has said I was you know I was
[1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:15.880]  praying one time about something and God said to me you said you didn't want a
[1:42:15.880 --> 1:42:19.680]  boring life and now you're upset because your life isn't boring which is it
[1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:24.800]  right he was telling me in your own mind you we pray to God we want adventure we
[1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:28.720]  want challenge what are we really made of we want this and God says okay I'm
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:32.840]  gonna give this to you oh how dare you God no I thought you loved your your
[1:42:32.840 --> 1:42:36.680]  creations your children your why do you let them persecute me and he really
[1:42:36.680 --> 1:42:39.960]  shook my what you're saying is absolutely true and you sum it up
[1:42:39.960 --> 1:42:43.520]  better than I can I don't like being persecuted a lot about but we're forcing
[1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:46.680]  evil out in the open and it's making me better and stronger and making me a
[1:42:46.680 --> 1:42:49.920]  better person fighting this evil we'll be right back with Mike Cernovich in

[1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:09.480]  that's exactly what the COVID passports are all about and clout swab and the UN
[1:44:09.480 --> 1:44:14.360]  and all the other globalist leaders own words they admit that once they've gotten
[1:44:14.360 --> 1:44:19.120]  you with that system then they're gonna carbon tax you everywhere you go and
[1:44:19.120 --> 1:44:23.720]  track what you do and publicly they're saying they're gonna decide when you can
[1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:27.800]  travel and when you can't travel and mastercard and then all the other big
[1:44:27.800 --> 1:44:31.680]  companies are currently announcing they're gonna track what you do and where
[1:44:31.680 --> 1:44:37.480]  you go and tax you with a carbon tax for it this is the holy grail of tyranny
[1:44:37.480 --> 1:44:41.080]  ladies and gentlemen this is the takeover in humanity better wake up and
[1:44:41.080 --> 1:44:45.160]  say no finally folks are starting to wake up Joe Rogan Tucker Carlson others
[1:44:45.160 --> 1:44:49.400]  who leave the charts one with info wars but it's not enough every individual has
[1:44:49.400 --> 1:44:53.160]  to not comply we have to talk about bringing the globalist to justice you
[1:44:53.160 --> 1:44:58.000]  see they need the fear of God put in them legally and lawfully we've all heard
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:02.680]  about the pastor in his famous statement from inside a concentration camp in
[1:45:02.680 --> 1:45:06.640]  World War two that when they came for one group he wasn't part of that group
[1:45:06.640 --> 1:45:09.840]  so he didn't stand up and then when they came for another group he wasn't part of
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:14.360]  that group so he didn't stand up and finally and they came for him there was
[1:45:14.360 --> 1:45:17.880]  nobody else to stand up well the global social credit score that China's putting
[1:45:17.880 --> 1:45:21.720]  in it's banning people to three hours of video games a week and if you criticize
[1:45:21.720 --> 1:45:25.440]  the government you can never buy or sell again well that's that's being brought
[1:45:25.440 --> 1:45:29.640]  here and all over the world under the guise of covid vaccine passports they
[1:45:29.640 --> 1:45:33.240]  even admit it now there's they have to be a carbon tax attached to it they're
[1:45:33.240 --> 1:45:36.720]  gonna track where you go what you do and decide where you can go and what you
[1:45:36.720 --> 1:45:40.560]  can do that's what the lockdowns are about you'll accept that you'll accept
[1:45:40.560 --> 1:45:45.120]  anything so again the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and
[1:45:45.120 --> 1:45:48.320]  tyranny pretending like they're part of the power structure but they're all
[1:45:48.320 --> 1:45:51.720]  gonna be targeted by this nightmare as well we need to get back to basic human
[1:45:51.720 --> 1:45:54.960]  rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible
[1:45:54.960 --> 1:45:59.880]  technocracy run by the globalist why do my enemies hate me so much why do the
[1:45:59.880 --> 1:46:04.880]  globalist take you so much why do they hate America so much because it's an
[1:46:04.880 --> 1:46:10.480]  idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot go
[1:46:10.480 --> 1:46:15.040]  exist with it's very very simple for their world government their anti-human
[1:46:15.040 --> 1:46:20.720]  post-human eugenics system to flourish freedom and liberty and due process in
[1:46:20.720 --> 1:46:26.320]  justice and God fearing systems must fail so sure you didn't start a fight
[1:46:26.320 --> 1:46:30.880]  with Bill Gates you didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller you didn't
[1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:36.160]  start a fight with the UN they started a fight with you and they're not gonna
[1:46:36.160 --> 1:46:40.880]  back down and they're not gonna go away they're not going to ever stop their
[1:46:40.880 --> 1:46:45.840]  attacks until they have the fear of God put into them the average person still
[1:46:45.840 --> 1:46:49.120]  doesn't even know about the new world order or about globalism or about
[1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:53.240]  corporate fascism and it's not until people understand that and that we're
[1:46:53.240 --> 1:46:57.840]  under attack we have any chance of beating these people
[1:46:59.680 --> 1:47:05.160]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:47:05.160 --> 1:47:22.840]  wow I mean I always liked Mike Cernovich I was a really smart guy but since he got
[1:47:22.840 --> 1:47:26.160]  married and had children years ago it just took him to a whole other level and
[1:47:26.160 --> 1:47:30.760]  I think that's the process we can also talk about that none of the top EU leaders
[1:47:30.760 --> 1:47:34.440]  have children none of them do that's a globalist thing is a post-human world
[1:47:34.440 --> 1:47:38.160]  they're giving up their humanity to be God they believe but they need to lock us
[1:47:38.160 --> 1:47:41.520]  in our five senses so you're talking about the infinity timeline during the
[1:47:41.520 --> 1:47:46.080]  break that's that's a great term expand on that Mike Cernovich yeah it was
[1:47:46.080 --> 1:47:49.280]  occurring to me how and you were mentioning some of the dreams you had
[1:47:49.280 --> 1:47:53.800]  that I definitely want to talk more about on the segment you have the timeline
[1:47:53.800 --> 1:47:59.560]  of the animal or the timeline of carnal pleasure the timeline of they want you
[1:47:59.560 --> 1:48:04.680]  to eat your bugs put on your VR goggles masturbate to internet pornography and
[1:48:04.680 --> 1:48:10.000]  then chase your next hunger-paying and that's the timeline of the devil the
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:15.040]  timeline of hedonic pleasure chasing that next hit of dopamine that next hit of
[1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:20.760]  carnal pleasure right animal pleasure the timeline of God is connection and
[1:48:20.760 --> 1:48:25.240]  universal love and connection to infinity we can obviously be in that state
[1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:29.760]  because we have to live in this world so there's a sense that we're walking or if
[1:48:29.760 --> 1:48:34.200]  we try we walk between two worlds the world of God the world of love the
[1:48:34.200 --> 1:48:39.320]  world of not everything goes your way but pushing through that versus the world
[1:48:39.320 --> 1:48:43.840]  of man which is oh I'm hungry I need to eat now I'm gonna eat a lot now I'm
[1:48:43.840 --> 1:48:48.440]  bored somebody entertain me now I'm gonna go cause problems for other people
[1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:53.840]  the left wants people on the timeline of the animal and then the right the real
[1:48:53.840 --> 1:48:57.040]  right not these fake conservatives these fake Christians like David French who
[1:48:57.040 --> 1:49:00.920]  come in God's name and then deceive people those people are on a really
[1:49:00.920 --> 1:49:04.880]  gonna have a real hard problem on judgment day but the real right wants
[1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:10.720]  people in the timeline of God which is that I would not say as Jesus said bless
[1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:15.080]  your persecutors but the more that I thought about it and a lot of things
[1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:19.160]  have been revealed to me in visions the more that I have developed a love for
[1:49:19.160 --> 1:49:23.880]  those who persecute me because I realized that they were traumatized as kids
[1:49:23.880 --> 1:49:27.880]  they're in denial of that that's why they come out in defense of of pedophilia
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:32.040]  so much is because I realized they've all been molested as kids that's how they
[1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:35.880]  think they get love yeah so they don't they got molested as kids and that's why
[1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:40.240]  they attack me because rather than deal with that internal trauma of what they
[1:49:40.240 --> 1:49:44.600]  experienced and reaching inward and ripping your heart open and letting that
[1:49:44.600 --> 1:49:49.120]  pain and that weepingness come out and then healing yourself through trauma
[1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:53.080]  they're lashing out so my own mind this is what God's been telling me is hey
[1:49:53.080 --> 1:49:55.800]  you don't have to be their friends nobody's saying be their friends nobody's
[1:49:55.800 --> 1:49:59.360]  saying let somebody kill you or your family but you have to love your
[1:49:59.360 --> 1:50:05.040]  persecutors because they have unresolved deep psychological trauma from child
[1:50:05.040 --> 1:50:10.160]  abuse they suffered as kids and rather than again rip their heart open and feel
[1:50:10.160 --> 1:50:14.040]  the healing of the Lord and the healing of God they're gonna attack you to live
[1:50:14.040 --> 1:50:18.240]  in denial of that exactly and what I experienced with the first stalkers I
[1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:23.680]  had 25 years ago was as soon as I forgave them and didn't care anymore they
[1:50:23.680 --> 1:50:28.520]  would instantly go away like oh there was a sixth sense there was a connection
[1:50:28.520 --> 1:50:31.960]  by the stalker against the person being stalked and I just learned with these
[1:50:31.960 --> 1:50:36.280]  dirty lawyers and corrupt groups and others that really hate me and just
[1:50:36.280 --> 1:50:40.320]  rise when they see me that that's because they're in spiritual bondage and
[1:50:40.320 --> 1:50:45.000]  they can see that I'm free and what's taking them over hates them just as much
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:48.640]  as it hates me and they're like a drowning person you try to save them they
[1:50:48.640 --> 1:50:52.560]  try to push you under and climb up on top of you and so you realize that they're
[1:50:52.560 --> 1:50:55.560]  a danger they're like a zombie you don't want to let them walk up and bite you
[1:50:55.560 --> 1:50:59.640]  you've got to keep them in arms length but they really are a failed fallen
[1:50:59.640 --> 1:51:04.280]  person and so you shouldn't rejoice in how stunted and twisted they are you
[1:51:04.280 --> 1:51:08.080]  should know that that's a failure and that and that we should have saved them
[1:51:08.080 --> 1:51:12.080]  yeah they're running in denial of themselves and I learned just a lot of
[1:51:12.080 --> 1:51:16.760]  experiences I've had turning more introspective as I've uncovered in my
[1:51:16.760 --> 1:51:21.520]  own self trauma that I didn't even know that I had and then I realized that a
[1:51:21.520 --> 1:51:26.080]  lot of what we do is we're running from ourselves we've become strong because
[1:51:26.080 --> 1:51:29.720]  we're afraid to be weak well why are we afraid to be weak well we're afraid to
[1:51:29.720 --> 1:51:33.560]  be weak because something bad happened to us when we were younger and then we
[1:51:33.560 --> 1:51:37.800]  become strong so that no one can hurt us and then we use that strength to turn
[1:51:37.800 --> 1:51:42.680]  outward and we end up in this endless conflict with people often people who
[1:51:42.680 --> 1:51:47.080]  are hurt also and instead the past you know several years especially the past
[1:51:47.080 --> 1:51:51.560]  two or three I just keep looking inward at my own trauma now so I like to listen
[1:51:51.560 --> 1:51:58.280]  to Bernardo beats or spiritual music and I cry a lot now I just let things out
[1:51:58.280 --> 1:52:02.440]  now because I used to think that you know real men don't cry real men fight
[1:52:02.440 --> 1:52:06.760]  back and then I realized why would I run for myself though how was how is it to
[1:52:06.760 --> 1:52:11.560]  beat a real man to run from the trauma within yourself well and I also think
[1:52:11.560 --> 1:52:14.440]  it's a balance I mean we're designed like a plant in zero gravity doesn't grow
[1:52:14.440 --> 1:52:18.160]  as well as a plant that's out in the sun in the wind and the rain part of that's
[1:52:18.160 --> 1:52:22.120]  what makes us stronger but we don't want to then have that take us over and
[1:52:22.120 --> 1:52:26.160]  dominate us that aspect and then exactly then do it to other people back
[1:52:26.160 --> 1:52:30.320]  because that's what happened to me is I got in a lot of just vicious fights I
[1:52:30.320 --> 1:52:33.480]  got beat up my bullies a lot that's just the way you know East Texas was
[1:52:33.480 --> 1:52:37.720]  growing up it was extremely violent like worse than you see in movies and then
[1:52:37.720 --> 1:52:41.480]  I got very tough and got into that identity of just being an absolute like
[1:52:41.480 --> 1:52:44.920]  you know psycho in a fight and then that became kind of like almost a satanic
[1:52:44.920 --> 1:52:48.480]  aspect of me and then I've learned how to just get rid of that and turn loose so
[1:52:48.480 --> 1:52:53.080]  that I still can fight if I need to but I'm not the raging animal anymore that's
[1:52:53.080 --> 1:52:56.200]  just one small aspect to me that I've got that I can break the glass if I need
[1:52:56.200 --> 1:52:59.440]  it but now it's under control well I'm glad that you said that you can still
[1:52:59.440 --> 1:53:03.160]  fight if you need to because it sounds like God's talking to a lot of people
[1:53:03.160 --> 1:53:08.120]  because that was told to me during a vision where I said why don't want to be
[1:53:08.120 --> 1:53:12.120]  this way you know I don't want to be kind and loving right towards the world
[1:53:12.120 --> 1:53:17.640]  because in my mind if you attack me that's the speed and the message was you
[1:53:17.640 --> 1:53:21.760]  can always be that way just try love try to be more loving to people try to be a
[1:53:21.760 --> 1:53:25.080]  little bit more decent to people try to understand that hey man they have
[1:53:25.080 --> 1:53:28.760]  unresolved trauma and they were abused as children that's what they're running
[1:53:28.760 --> 1:53:31.520]  from that's why they're attacking you because they see you as a father figure
[1:53:31.520 --> 1:53:35.560]  they see you as the people who hurt them and then you realize that our burden or
[1:53:35.560 --> 1:53:40.760]  our cross the bear metaphorically speaking is that they're hurting they
[1:53:40.760 --> 1:53:43.680]  don't want to admit that they're hurting so then they want to hurt other people
[1:53:43.680 --> 1:53:46.880]  and then what we do is we think well now you hurt me and I'm gonna continue the
[1:53:46.880 --> 1:53:52.280]  cycle of trauma which is you have trauma you attack me and then I attack you and
[1:53:52.280 --> 1:53:57.720]  now we're engaged in never any conflict of trauma instead of going within and
[1:53:57.720 --> 1:54:01.840]  realizing I want to attack the wicked ones I want to attack the the entities
[1:54:01.840 --> 1:54:06.360]  that try to embody people and often do become embodied in people you're feeding
[1:54:06.360 --> 1:54:10.320]  into demonic energy when you do that but then the flip side is you we do live
[1:54:10.320 --> 1:54:13.960]  in a world and you can't just let people destroy your run over from a
[1:54:13.960 --> 1:54:17.240]  controlled position where you don't get roped into their level you still stand
[1:54:17.240 --> 1:54:22.200]  up for yourself you fight the evil but you realize that that jumping right
[1:54:22.200 --> 1:54:26.360]  in to people trying to punch your buttons is literally letting them control
[1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:30.760]  you yeah then they win because they're able now to it's almost like a bullfight
[1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:36.120]  they're able to get you to play by their rules and play by your game so more and
[1:54:36.120 --> 1:54:39.680]  more when people try to initiate conflict with me I say I'm praying for
[1:54:39.680 --> 1:54:45.080]  you I love you and often they get more angry and then I realize that the and
[1:54:45.080 --> 1:54:49.960]  this is sad that the sad realization that I had was if you attack me and I attack
[1:54:49.960 --> 1:54:53.840]  you back you feel validated and good if you attack me and I say man I love you
[1:54:53.840 --> 1:54:57.920]  I'm gonna pray for you you actually get angrier because that demon within you the
[1:54:57.920 --> 1:55:00.880]  entities the demons whatever people want to call them the dark energy then
[1:55:00.880 --> 1:55:05.680]  becomes enraged because they're working through you and now they're being
[1:55:05.680 --> 1:55:10.240]  received love and of course they exist in the world of hate they get angrier so
[1:55:10.240 --> 1:55:12.400]  more and more and more I just think I love you it doesn't mean you're gonna
[1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:16.360]  steamroll me it doesn't mean that you're gonna transcend that that negative
[1:55:16.360 --> 1:55:21.280]  energy level right at least until we can get to a higher level I don't want to be
[1:55:21.280 --> 1:55:25.640]  a job obviously so when I pray I'm careful because I'm grateful for the
[1:55:25.640 --> 1:55:29.080]  suffering God has given you I don't want to be given a Jovian quest yeah I don't
[1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:32.080]  want to we're kind of getting on one now like and that's why I struggle in my
[1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:37.200]  own my own prayer practice is I thank God for the struggles but I say whoa but
[1:55:37.200 --> 1:55:40.400]  I'm not I'm not trying to be Job here God I still want to have a nice life and
[1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:45.280]  enjoy some of this earthly experience but Jovian of course would be the
[1:55:45.280 --> 1:55:49.480]  ultimate transcendence of the human condition and becoming completely
[1:55:49.480 --> 1:55:54.040]  connected to the divine and I'm not there yet it's up to God whether that's
[1:55:54.040 --> 1:55:57.400]  gonna happen to us hopefully hopefully not might happen to everybody around
[1:55:57.400 --> 1:56:01.400]  now because of what the the new guard the new red guard is trying to do here in
[1:56:01.400 --> 1:56:05.680]  this country we'll talk about that next hour but definitely they even talk
[1:56:05.680 --> 1:56:10.000]  about it the other the the magicians the wizards that run you know the dark
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:13.560]  side they know their time's coming to an end I mean and that's what all this
[1:56:13.560 --> 1:56:17.920]  oppression is about to keep us in a lower state they can control that's why
[1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:21.720]  they're going harder and harder on anything Christian that's why they're
[1:56:21.720 --> 1:56:25.800]  going harder and harder on anyone who has traditional values that's why they're
[1:56:25.800 --> 1:56:30.440]  making a saint of a literal convicted pedophile that used to be it was a
[1:56:30.440 --> 1:56:33.640]  conspiracy theory to say that most of these Antifa people were pedophiles and
[1:56:33.640 --> 1:56:38.200]  then there's an actual convicted pedophile who gets shot trying to harm
[1:56:38.200 --> 1:56:43.440]  a minor and now he's their new saint so the left is propped up from the Kenosha
[1:56:43.440 --> 1:56:48.120]  event they're trying to prop up a pedophile as a saint that's something that five
[1:56:48.120 --> 1:56:51.120]  years ago they would have said well you're a conspiracy theorist for saying
[1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:54.280]  that and now I think well they're holding signs out there with this picture
[1:56:54.280 --> 1:56:57.320]  they're calling them a superhero convicted pedophile hurt children nine to
[1:56:57.320 --> 1:57:01.840]  eleven and it wasn't just that was horrific we'll just leave it there we
[1:57:01.840 --> 1:57:05.640]  don't know you need to go into details that's what they're doing to prop up but
[1:57:05.640 --> 1:57:11.280]  that shows their desperation because they have to go to that level now they
[1:57:11.280 --> 1:57:14.800]  have to sink to that level of evil looks so much good as a rising and our
[1:57:14.800 --> 1:57:18.400]  biggest problem honestly are the false prophets the people who claim to come in
[1:57:18.400 --> 1:57:21.720]  God's name and clearly aren't the misleading people they're connected
[1:57:21.720 --> 1:57:25.840]  with the father of lies the you know conservative media people that is a
[1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:29.200]  bigger problem even than the left because they're misleading and deceiving
[1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:34.800]  Christians well I know this the US senators know that Pfizer did a world
[1:57:34.800 --> 1:57:37.520]  contract and that we signed on to a world government contract they're not
[1:57:37.520 --> 1:57:41.440]  talking about it and and that's the big so into bring some of that up with you
[1:57:41.440 --> 1:57:44.480]  as well because that's that's happening the Archbishop though he is talking
[1:57:44.480 --> 1:57:49.560]  about it all the Archbishop for a fraction there are so many crappy
[1:57:49.560 --> 1:57:55.360]  brands of energy products energy drinks energy powders energy pills and look
[1:57:55.360 --> 1:57:59.560]  almost all of them work but they're toxic and they've got incredible

[1:58:53.280 --> 1:58:57.720]  have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress
[1:58:57.720 --> 1:59:03.320]  symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and
[1:59:03.320 --> 1:59:09.120]  respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in France notice that people
[1:59:09.120 --> 1:59:13.560]  who ate certain quail eggs experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[1:59:13.560 --> 1:59:18.160]  responses they began studying this effect in published trials and decades
[1:59:18.160 --> 1:59:22.800]  later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet
[1:59:22.800 --> 1:59:27.440]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and
[1:59:27.440 --> 1:59:32.160]  effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it
[1:59:32.160 --> 1:59:36.520]  actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that
[1:59:36.520 --> 1:59:40.920]  amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body go outside and

[2:00:10.800 --> 2:00:17.040]  well they definitely want us to be blind spiritually Mike Sarno is with us
[2:00:17.040 --> 2:00:20.320]  for the rest of the hour hell and Tim bull gets in here I mean he says he's
[2:00:20.320 --> 2:00:23.200]  coming on he's always busy that guy works hard we'll have a round table
[2:00:23.200 --> 2:00:26.440]  discussion and you guys had a great round table discussion I guess it was a
[2:00:26.440 --> 2:00:31.480]  last night out in his travel trailer I really like how he set that RV up yeah
[2:00:31.480 --> 2:00:36.000]  Tim's the hardest-working man in media I used to be the hardest man and then I
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:39.760]  saw how temple worked because you can you can in the media thing there's like
[2:00:39.760 --> 2:00:43.520]  levels to this where some people I was actually making a chart that I was
[2:00:43.520 --> 2:00:48.760]  thinking about where you have raw charisma and you would be at the very
[2:00:48.760 --> 2:00:52.880]  absolute top of the raw charisma to the degree that a lot of people think oh I
[2:00:52.880 --> 2:00:55.840]  could have been a actor you could have done anything so you're the highest
[2:00:55.840 --> 2:00:59.600]  level of charisma and then you're in the grid of like hard-working and then you
[2:00:59.600 --> 2:01:02.840]  have people who work really hard and maybe have lower charisma and it's always
[2:01:02.840 --> 2:01:06.640]  finding a balance well I think you're super smart and I think Tim's super
[2:01:06.640 --> 2:01:09.720]  smart I mean getting to know Tim the stuff he says behind scenes like it's
[2:01:09.720 --> 2:01:13.320]  like wow he really says things that are true that I never thought before you
[2:01:13.320 --> 2:01:16.200]  know I mean like he's insightful yeah he's very analytical and he works very
[2:01:16.200 --> 2:01:20.400]  hard whereas I don't work nearly as hard as either of you so there's there's
[2:01:20.400 --> 2:01:24.720]  definitely levels and that was you know something to talk about is the strange
[2:01:24.720 --> 2:01:28.400]  thing is I quit working so hard I was grinding you remember those days and
[2:01:28.400 --> 2:01:32.600]  yeah I was on all the time 20 hours that yeah and then I was with you and we
[2:01:32.600 --> 2:01:36.840]  were in a diner in Austin and when we walked in this is 2017 maybe you're
[2:01:36.840 --> 2:01:42.240]  more famous now the whole restaurant like stopped it was a buzzing where people
[2:01:42.240 --> 2:01:48.200]  were I could feel the energy and then I started and then the waitress said oh my
[2:01:48.200 --> 2:01:51.960]  husband's a cook he wants to come meet you everybody knew who you were and I
[2:01:51.960 --> 2:01:56.000]  thought you know what I don't want that level of fame I remember you said that
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:59.520]  pretty much that day yeah I said and I never did your show after that and then
[2:01:59.520 --> 2:02:02.400]  it created all this drama on the internet where people say oh you betrayed
[2:02:02.400 --> 2:02:06.600]  Alex you backstabbed Alex what do you talk I've told I told you people a
[2:02:06.600 --> 2:02:10.040]  hundred times I don't want to be famous it's like they don't believe me but I
[2:02:10.040 --> 2:02:13.160]  told you that but we also remember you were frustrated by Trump you didn't want
[2:02:13.160 --> 2:02:17.320]  to attack him but he was I mean I'll just say it I would get more supportive I
[2:02:17.320 --> 2:02:20.920]  just blindly saw but I'm getting really sick of him yeah I mean I can't if I
[2:02:20.920 --> 2:02:23.600]  think I want to go bullhorn his house I don't want to go under the tunnel and
[2:02:23.600 --> 2:02:26.920]  meet with him and eat dinner with him I could have done that I want him to stop
[2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:29.840]  it and be who he could really be that's why I got mad at Joe Rogan a few years
[2:02:29.840 --> 2:02:32.040]  ago because he could really change the world and he's starting to go in that
[2:02:32.040 --> 2:02:36.000]  direction it's only my job to make people be good guys it's just that Trump
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:39.160]  really screwed the pooch with some of the things he's done we'll talk about it
[2:02:39.160 --> 2:02:43.440]  next segment but keep going sorry yeah that the notoriety and the fame that you
[2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:48.640]  had so I I just cut I pretty much went dark and I'm not dark as in evil dark as
[2:02:48.640 --> 2:02:52.640]  in I quit doing a lot of streamings I cut back a lot and then people had all
[2:02:52.640 --> 2:02:55.560]  these conspiracy theories ironically enough about you and me and we had some
[2:02:55.560 --> 2:02:59.080]  huge falling out we're really I just remember that moment in the Austin Diner
[2:02:59.080 --> 2:03:02.400]  and said Alex I don't ever want to be like this and you said oh you got to
[2:03:02.400 --> 2:03:05.800]  accept it it's the burden it's the price of being a truth teller and a
[2:03:05.800 --> 2:03:10.760]  story teller and sharing true information with people I didn't want it
[2:03:10.760 --> 2:03:15.720]  so I went to a much lower profile to the agree that I don't even know if I'm
[2:03:15.720 --> 2:03:19.840]  relevant apparently I still am people recognize me public all the time but I
[2:03:19.840 --> 2:03:25.520]  tried to go way down to a much lower level of notoriety because that's where
[2:03:25.520 --> 2:03:29.920]  I do better creativity creativity wise is where I do better spirituality wise
[2:03:29.920 --> 2:03:34.080]  but it was something to just see and again you're way bigger now than you
[2:03:34.080 --> 2:03:38.760]  were then to be in that moment and I felt like that was even a message from
[2:03:38.760 --> 2:03:44.560]  God to say do you want this and I said no I I definitely don't want to make a
[2:03:44.560 --> 2:03:47.160]  bunch of number one films so it's not even hiding under a rock because I had
[2:03:47.160 --> 2:03:51.360]  obligation yeah I had obligation to the people as you are starting hoax then
[2:03:51.360 --> 2:03:54.120]  run around the time yeah yeah I was starting hoax I had obligation to the
[2:03:54.120 --> 2:03:58.040]  people who crowdfunded it had obligation to the directors who have all moved on
[2:03:58.040 --> 2:04:02.320]  to bigger and better things now I had obligation morally to get it out there
[2:04:02.320 --> 2:04:07.440]  and then once that was done I haven't done anything big since hoax right I'm
[2:04:07.440 --> 2:04:10.400]  still around I still show I'm glad I finally got you to come to town I've
[2:04:10.400 --> 2:04:14.200]  only asked you about 400 times yeah and I kept saying I was going to and then I
[2:04:14.200 --> 2:04:19.440]  had to retreat a little bit and the world it's it's complicated for a right
[2:04:19.440 --> 2:04:24.440]  for 60 seconds when we come back to why are you re-emerging okay and people can

[2:06:10.520 --> 2:06:17.600]  wow my Sernovich is really on fire and he's talking about the big galactic
[2:06:17.600 --> 2:06:22.560]  battle good versus evil and the Rubicon that we've crossed so so let's get into
[2:06:22.560 --> 2:06:25.360]  wherever you want to go next I mean I also want to talk about Trump I don't
[2:06:25.360 --> 2:06:30.360]  fetishize attacking Trump like some people do to like prove their avant-garde
[2:06:30.360 --> 2:06:33.560]  or they're the most conservative Trump has incredible potential I believe it
[2:06:33.560 --> 2:06:37.760]  really means well and but once he signs on to something like this vaccine then
[2:06:37.760 --> 2:06:42.240]  he's pigheaded but the last straw for me is January 6th not to fit in the
[2:06:42.240 --> 2:06:46.600]  innocent people enough and I know that's an issue for you and also what
[2:06:46.600 --> 2:06:50.160]  happened with Julian Assange I mean I remember Trump three months for the
[2:06:50.160 --> 2:06:54.800]  election they can pull the clip up saying hey I don't care where Hillary's
[2:06:54.800 --> 2:06:58.040]  emails came from I don't care if it's a fat guy you know in his mom's basement
[2:06:58.040 --> 2:07:02.000]  or who Julian Assange or the Russians whoever's got it release it and then
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:05.440]  saying WikiLeaks release it and then they release it he wins the election and
[2:07:05.440 --> 2:07:10.480]  then he just lets him twist in the wind that to me then prove a lot of the
[2:07:10.480 --> 2:07:12.960]  stuff I heard about Trump only caring about Trump because if I was the
[2:07:12.960 --> 2:07:16.120]  president I don't give a damn what the deep state said Julian Assange is getting
[2:07:16.120 --> 2:07:20.880]  a pardon yeah there's a mantra that I live by which goes like this character
[2:07:20.880 --> 2:07:26.120]  is destiny and that's why I tend to make the best predictions out of you know
[2:07:26.120 --> 2:07:29.160]  you make great ones too obviously that's why people say how do you know what's
[2:07:29.160 --> 2:07:32.240]  happening how do you know what this is gonna happen what characters destiny so
[2:07:32.240 --> 2:07:36.640]  what I saw with Trump when I saw what Trump character is destiny when he
[2:07:36.640 --> 2:07:42.480]  fired General Flynn that was to me a seminal moment in your character so
[2:07:42.480 --> 2:07:47.240]  there is an every man woman's life what you call a seminal moment this is what
[2:07:47.240 --> 2:07:52.400]  defines who you are and how you handle it Trump fired General Flynn because he
[2:07:52.400 --> 2:07:56.120]  was being bullied by the media because he was being bullied by Mike Pence or
[2:07:56.120 --> 2:08:00.280]  whoever else who Mike Pence in the end did what Mike Pence sided with the
[2:08:00.280 --> 2:08:03.560]  establishment so that was also a character is destiny moment for Mike
[2:08:03.560 --> 2:08:07.160]  Pence because Mike Pence revealed who he was by demanding that General Flynn be
[2:08:07.160 --> 2:08:13.800]  fired and right when I saw that I said I don't dislike Trump because I'm a true
[2:08:13.800 --> 2:08:17.880]  conservative who write these false prophets as I call them the false
[2:08:17.880 --> 2:08:22.240]  prophets at the national review that's not why I disliked him I disliked him
[2:08:22.240 --> 2:08:27.080]  because that was a moment of grave moral weakness it was a moment of low
[2:08:27.080 --> 2:08:31.640]  character it was a moment of being pathetic and that right there showed
[2:08:31.640 --> 2:08:36.080]  me okay Trump's weak and he's gonna be weak throughout his presidency brought
[2:08:36.080 --> 2:08:39.680]  in all the Soros people and then they brought in the never Trumpers he didn't
[2:08:39.680 --> 2:08:44.760]  hire his own loyal people he didn't defend his loyal people he could have
[2:08:44.760 --> 2:08:49.080]  pardoned everybody who got indicted right away by this Mueller thing that we
[2:08:49.080 --> 2:08:51.920]  now know as a hoax it's all been proven as a hoax I know I'm not with the
[2:08:51.920 --> 2:08:55.280]  Russians and I watched congressional hearings where they said I am a Russian
[2:08:55.280 --> 2:08:58.520]  they yeah they would say absurd things about me too I've read articles where
[2:08:58.520 --> 2:09:01.760]  they claimed that I would talk to people on burner phones and everything I was
[2:09:01.760 --> 2:09:06.360]  like why would I talk to on a burner phone right but in their mind there were
[2:09:06.360 --> 2:09:10.400]  all these machinations happening behind the scene when really I would just
[2:09:10.400 --> 2:09:12.960]  stream I could talk to whoever wanted to and I would talk to them on the
[2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:17.560]  telephone but I don't want to talk to anyone right I've never talked to any
[2:09:17.560 --> 2:09:21.920]  of these people on the phone actually because in my own mind I'm the culture
[2:09:21.920 --> 2:09:26.340]  it would be them talking to me right in my mind why do I want to talk to Trump
[2:09:26.340 --> 2:09:29.320]  Trump should want you know Trump would want to talk to me but why would I talk
[2:09:29.320 --> 2:09:34.000]  to him what would be interesting about that well you know Tucker Carlson hates
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:38.840]  Trump well anybody who has anybody who respects moral character doesn't like
[2:09:38.840 --> 2:09:42.640]  Trump because he doesn't have moral character he got remember he shut down
[2:09:42.640 --> 2:09:46.800]  the government got dog walked by Nancy Pelosi he said I'll never sign another
[2:09:46.800 --> 2:09:50.120]  one of these big spending bills and then of course he signs another one they
[2:09:50.120 --> 2:09:54.280]  dog walked him every time Mitch dog walked him every time he backed down so
[2:09:54.280 --> 2:09:58.200]  in every group they for let's just talk about Trump and Mike Tyson for example
[2:09:58.200 --> 2:10:03.680]  if you listened to you know customata before he went if you listen to Tyson's
[2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:09.600]  trainers they would tell you that Tyson only had four real fights the reason
[2:10:09.600 --> 2:10:14.120]  being is the everybody he beat wasn't a fight because he was so good but then he
[2:10:14.120 --> 2:10:18.040]  fought Holyfield that was a real fight what happened and Mike Tyson admits this
[2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:22.680]  so I'm not back here to bash Mike Tyson he failed in every real fight Mike
[2:10:22.680 --> 2:10:28.960]  Tyson had he failed in every real fight that Trump had he failed he did not
[2:10:28.960 --> 2:10:33.160]  pardon Julian Assange he did not pardon Snowden he did not pardon Ross Ubrich he
[2:10:33.160 --> 2:10:37.640]  didn't pardon the nonviolent January 6 protesters he could have issued a lot of
[2:10:37.640 --> 2:10:41.360]  people don't know this because you're not allowed to talk about it he could have
[2:10:41.360 --> 2:10:46.360]  said I hereby pardon everybody who engaged in non-violence in the capital
[2:10:46.360 --> 2:10:49.960]  January 6 incident so then the people who are violent were hitting cops yeah
[2:10:49.960 --> 2:10:54.920]  sure go to jail they belong there but the random boomers who came into town and
[2:10:54.920 --> 2:10:58.440]  didn't know anything and they was like a rock concert and everybody's walking one
[2:10:58.440 --> 2:11:01.360]  way and then you walk in the Capitol and you look around oh here's the capital
[2:11:01.360 --> 2:11:05.040]  take a selfie their lives have been destroyed that was a moral failing on
[2:11:05.040 --> 2:11:11.400]  his part I do not ever excuse or defend moral character weakness and that's
[2:11:11.400 --> 2:11:15.720]  here's the thing Trump could be salvaged I think partially at least the people he
[2:11:15.720 --> 2:11:20.560]  endorses are getting elected and so he has some value I'm not trying to throw
[2:11:20.560 --> 2:11:23.760]  the baby out with the bathwater it's just watching the cue thing and the
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:27.960]  delusions and he's invincible that kept people from really being awakened
[2:11:27.960 --> 2:11:32.000]  involved and let them steal the election and so part of having Trump gone now
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:35.440]  really makes people realize how much trouble we're in because I mean I got
[2:11:35.440 --> 2:11:43.400]  really I was never in the Trump cult but I really wanted him to succeed and now
[2:11:43.400 --> 2:11:47.480]  what do you think happens with Trump because he told Roger Stone a few
[2:11:47.480 --> 2:11:52.280]  months ago at dinner I mean he said I'm running again so he's running in folks
[2:11:52.280 --> 2:11:56.440]  and he's now exercising hours a day to lose weight he's lost a ton of weight
[2:11:56.440 --> 2:12:01.440]  and I mean Trump is he thought Trump wanted to win before look out well it
[2:12:01.440 --> 2:12:05.480]  goes back to I think character is destiny I don't see his characters not
[2:12:05.480 --> 2:12:08.960]  gonna change the people he has around them are the same people who backstabbed
[2:12:08.960 --> 2:12:13.240]  him in the White House I think he gets trounced unless they run Kamala Harris
[2:12:13.240 --> 2:12:17.680]  then maybe Trump can win who is good or is there's just you know don't look to
[2:12:17.680 --> 2:12:21.680]  presidential leaders I mean what what's the what's what's your scoop on people
[2:12:21.680 --> 2:12:27.560]  like DeSantis well the issue is complicated because Trump despite my
[2:12:27.560 --> 2:12:31.840]  belief that he is a coward truly a coward and I mean that advisedly a
[2:12:31.840 --> 2:12:36.480]  complete and total coward the country was still better under him so if he runs
[2:12:36.480 --> 2:12:42.080]  and it's Donald J. Trump or Kamala Harris then clearly I'm not going to be
[2:12:42.080 --> 2:12:47.240]  then clearly I'm not gonna vote for her Hitler evil she kept innocent people in
[2:12:47.240 --> 2:12:50.640]  jail this is the left on purpose yeah yeah this is all been proven their
[2:12:50.640 --> 2:12:53.720]  petitions you can find that the media never wanted black she was in a one
[2:12:53.720 --> 2:12:58.880]  drop of African blood so what they do is she she imprisoned people wrongfully
[2:12:58.880 --> 2:13:02.280]  this is all documented when she was an attorney general she's a truly wicked
[2:13:02.280 --> 2:13:06.960]  person she puts Hillary Clinton's shame so it's them it's fine but I don't
[2:13:06.960 --> 2:13:12.040]  have to to like the guy I don't have to respect the guy but in our two parties
[2:13:12.040 --> 2:13:18.560]  system you have to vote who you vote for but I don't see how he stops a repeat
[2:13:18.560 --> 2:13:23.440]  of what happened in 2020 because they didn't run a serious game to prevent
[2:13:23.440 --> 2:13:28.120]  that all of this is not true that he is just surrounded like his latest social
[2:13:28.120 --> 2:13:31.800]  media site I know the inside scoop on it's like a pump and dump it did none of
[2:13:31.800 --> 2:13:35.520]  it's gonna work it's all and I'm not mad I mean I'm not trying to put down them I
[2:13:35.520 --> 2:13:40.840]  wish it was I am I am I am I don't like people who scam a vulnerable I don't
[2:13:40.840 --> 2:13:43.760]  think he even knows that it just he has these scammers all around him well that
[2:13:43.760 --> 2:13:47.960]  but again that's people would apologize for him and I will like here's what I've
[2:13:47.960 --> 2:13:50.760]  always told my people I even tweeted this out when they all your criticizing
[2:13:50.760 --> 2:13:55.680]  Trump I said I have made mistakes in my life have I ever once told you to
[2:13:55.680 --> 2:13:59.640]  apologize for my mistakes never you know what I tell people you know I'm an
[2:13:59.640 --> 2:14:03.840]  imperfect person I made a lot of mistakes it's up to God to judge me if you have a
[2:14:03.840 --> 2:14:07.320]  problem with anything I've ever said or done then I completely understand that
[2:14:07.320 --> 2:14:10.920]  you don't need to apologize to me I'm a grown man Donald Trump has everybody
[2:14:10.920 --> 2:14:15.600]  want you know we don't make rationalizations for men full grown men
[2:14:15.600 --> 2:14:19.480]  in their 70s that's infatisling them that's making them as if they're off to
[2:14:19.480 --> 2:14:23.960]  be children he has people oh yeah you better it reads like a bad debt
[2:14:23.960 --> 2:14:27.920]  collection letter oh your name's missing from this list your access is gonna be
[2:14:27.920 --> 2:14:32.320]  suspended looks like debt collection letters as a total scam he's scamming
[2:14:32.320 --> 2:14:36.520]  vulnerable people I'm problem with that and I've said that a hundred times about
[2:14:36.520 --> 2:14:38.960]  a problem with that I don't care oh somebody's gonna unfollow me on Twitter
[2:14:38.960 --> 2:14:43.480]  oh no somebody's not gonna like me I'm gonna lose whatever cloud I don't care
[2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:49.280]  my job is in your job because we're we're on a different level than Trump
[2:14:49.280 --> 2:14:54.440]  leaders of men and to show men this is why we have to stand steadfast in what
[2:14:54.440 --> 2:14:57.960]  we do this is the higher calling God gave us you know what we're under attack
[2:14:57.960 --> 2:15:02.640]  you know what we've made mistakes we own it we keep moving forward we have to
[2:15:02.640 --> 2:15:06.200]  show the next generation of men this is how you live don't live like Donald
[2:15:06.200 --> 2:15:10.800]  Trump don't betray your supporters don't back down in those moments that test
[2:15:10.800 --> 2:15:14.800]  your character you got to push forward he fired general Flynn he didn't pardon
[2:15:14.800 --> 2:15:18.360]  the nonviolent protesters what about the assigns thing he told him a song's
[2:15:18.360 --> 2:15:22.520]  release it and then he lets him rot and solve her confinement that pisses me off
[2:15:22.520 --> 2:15:26.480]  it should and there's no there's no way to apologize for people have to vote for
[2:15:26.480 --> 2:15:30.360]  who they're gonna vote for fine with me that's the problem is the other side so
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:34.240]  evil I don't think Trump's bad but I do think he's got a spoiled rich kid he's
[2:15:34.240 --> 2:15:38.360]  smart in many ways it's just that he's so pampered and he's got those sick of
[2:15:38.360 --> 2:15:43.600]  fans around him it is that's the problem yeah he grew up in affluence he grew up
[2:15:43.600 --> 2:15:48.000]  with playing with house money massive wealth and connections from his own dad
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:51.920]  he's never been truly tested he's never been truly through the crucible he's
[2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:58.840]  never been right back let's talk about that when we come back hey everybody

[2:20:43.240 --> 2:20:47.120]  here in about 20 30 months we'll get get Tim over here and maybe get Tim's lovely
[2:20:47.120 --> 2:20:50.160]  really smart awesome wife as well the little power behind the throne over
[2:20:50.160 --> 2:20:56.400]  there anyways Cernovich you were getting into Trump here and I think it's
[2:20:56.400 --> 2:20:59.760]  important that's what that's what Tucker Carlson told me and it's no secret to
[2:20:59.760 --> 2:21:02.360]  Tucker and our friends I'll leave it at that but we we do talk quite a bit and
[2:21:02.360 --> 2:21:06.240]  you know I think Tucker you think I was this immoral psycho evil person told me
[2:21:06.240 --> 2:21:08.680]  this ten years ago when he first came to visit went to dinner and stuff it on
[2:21:08.680 --> 2:21:12.480]  out and then he saw the stuff come true thought okay he's kind of crazy but he
[2:21:12.480 --> 2:21:16.120]  did he means well and then now he's like oh my god it was all true and then he's
[2:21:16.120 --> 2:21:20.960]  kind of taking it next level so he tried to get Trump to to to stand up to the
[2:21:20.960 --> 2:21:23.880]  rush to get stuff and did not fire Flynn and all those things as they talk
[2:21:23.880 --> 2:21:27.520]  every day as you know and he's found we just scream at Trump and Trump still
[2:21:27.520 --> 2:21:30.160]  wouldn't listen to him when he was giving him the same advice you were
[2:21:30.160 --> 2:21:33.160]  giving it and I think that's the frustration I hear in your voice yeah
[2:21:33.160 --> 2:21:38.240]  it's a primarily moral character issue it's a primarily issue of having been
[2:21:38.240 --> 2:21:42.680]  tested having been smashed around and Trump has lived a very easy life born into
[2:21:42.680 --> 2:21:46.800]  an opulence rich dad I don't begrudge that hope I'm trying to give a life like
[2:21:46.800 --> 2:21:50.240]  that for my daughter but I still have adversity for them so my daughter she's
[2:21:50.240 --> 2:21:54.520]  right when she turned four she's doing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu right away my three
[2:21:54.520 --> 2:21:57.600]  year old we already show her stuff everything's very physically outers got
[2:21:57.600 --> 2:22:00.960]  quite a presence a little yeah yeah she's done she's the older one she's got
[2:22:00.960 --> 2:22:04.640]  charisma we're building that already and part of that is I know that she lives in
[2:22:04.640 --> 2:22:09.040]  a nice a life than I lived as a kid but I train them always to be tough to have
[2:22:09.040 --> 2:22:12.660]  adversity okay we're gonna run down the hallway we're gonna we're gonna race all
[2:22:12.660 --> 2:22:16.680]  the time because you have to teach people mental toughness from an early age
[2:22:16.680 --> 2:22:21.880]  because that's what drives you there's a great quote that I love it's
[2:22:21.880 --> 2:22:25.680]  attributed I think Mark divine and we don't know who it came from it could be
[2:22:25.680 --> 2:22:30.040]  a military saying though it says you don't rise to the occasion you fall to
[2:22:30.040 --> 2:22:34.000]  your lowest level of training right everybody has think about that for a
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:38.960]  minute you don't rise to the occasion you fall to your training everyone has it
[2:22:38.960 --> 2:22:44.120]  in their own mind from the superhero movies that you get you're born you're
[2:22:44.120 --> 2:22:47.640]  found by a mentor they give you these magical powers the green lantern finds
[2:22:47.640 --> 2:22:50.960]  the ring spider-man gets if you think about the again the mythology because
[2:22:50.960 --> 2:22:55.200]  that's what people do is they live by the board the sword yeah exactly and
[2:22:55.200 --> 2:22:59.240]  then suddenly you have heroism that isn't really how it works you pull the
[2:22:59.240 --> 2:23:02.360]  sword and then somebody tries to kill you and beat you up and steal this so it
[2:23:02.360 --> 2:23:05.480]  steals the sword and then you have to go find the sword again that's how real
[2:23:05.480 --> 2:23:09.160]  that's how it really works so people in their own mind think oh yeah if somebody
[2:23:09.160 --> 2:23:12.680]  right now kicked in the door I would totally do kung fu moves and no you
[2:23:12.680 --> 2:23:16.400]  wouldn't you would pee your pants you would cry you would hide because you
[2:23:16.400 --> 2:23:21.560]  don't rise to the occasion you fall to your training so our duty as men and as
[2:23:21.560 --> 2:23:25.040]  I'm training my own daughters is to impose that kind of training that mental
[2:23:25.040 --> 2:23:28.880]  toughness that fortitude knowing that you can go farther than you can think you
[2:23:28.880 --> 2:23:32.040]  can go knowing that your brain is gonna impose limits on you that it doesn't
[2:23:32.040 --> 2:23:36.840]  have this I'm impressed how old your older daughter was in her life okay I
[2:23:36.840 --> 2:23:40.800]  mean she had the look of like like a 70 year old smart old woman whenever she
[2:23:40.800 --> 2:23:43.880]  was like I don't want barbecue with daddy and she was just like mmm but the way
[2:23:43.880 --> 2:23:47.600]  she said it and looked at everybody was had a lot of confidence way beyond her
[2:23:47.600 --> 2:23:52.000]  years that's impressive yeah we're teaching her command presence so we're
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:55.980]  always like we go somewhere I say Cyra look I contact tell them what you want
[2:23:55.980 --> 2:24:00.360]  no dad I'm shy be brave all the time into mantras look at the fake left
[2:24:00.360 --> 2:24:03.600]  feminists say oh we want to empower women but they say your victims be scared
[2:24:03.600 --> 2:24:08.040]  girl instead of like real patriots our daughters are incredible yeah that's
[2:24:08.040 --> 2:24:11.160]  what I mean I have my my daughter in Brazilian jiu-jitsu I have my little
[2:24:11.160 --> 2:24:14.720]  one who's three I say attack I want my daughters to be the president all my
[2:24:14.720 --> 2:24:18.560]  daughters have not a will to battle axe and then no conservative Christian ever
[2:24:18.560 --> 2:24:22.280]  tried to hurt their daughters that's a lie that the system wants to enslave your
[2:24:22.280 --> 2:24:25.560]  daughters well the system wants to enslave everyone men and women they just
[2:24:25.560 --> 2:24:29.760]  enslave them by different ways so the way they enslave man men is primarily
[2:24:29.760 --> 2:24:33.560]  via the use of mind control and internet pornography and the way they enslave
[2:24:33.560 --> 2:24:38.720]  women is through the self victimization mindset and what we can't even look at
[2:24:38.720 --> 2:24:43.080]  porn anymore well it's even look at it there's a karmic there's a karmic cost
[2:24:43.080 --> 2:24:46.560]  to it because a lot of them have been trafficked and once you realize the
[2:24:46.560 --> 2:24:52.360]  karmic cost so I had a vision one time where when you watch porn your face is
[2:24:52.360 --> 2:24:56.340]  becoming brought into that screen like through the looking glass like Alice in
[2:24:56.340 --> 2:24:59.720]  Wonderland and then you have the karmic debt of all the suffering so your
[2:24:59.720 --> 2:25:04.400]  consuming human karma you're consuming you're involved in crime you're
[2:25:04.400 --> 2:25:07.160]  consuming it that's what you're eating it you're not you think you're
[2:25:07.160 --> 2:25:11.720]  pleasuring yourself sinning yeah you're death eating right so you think that
[2:25:11.720 --> 2:25:15.920]  oh I'm this is beautiful I'm pleasure myself no you're not you're consuming
[2:25:15.920 --> 2:25:20.840]  dark hot karma that's entering you because sex is a ritual between men and
[2:25:20.840 --> 2:25:25.520]  women fusing a new creature that a spirit literally comes into and and then
[2:25:25.520 --> 2:25:28.320]  to be even involved in something separate other people that have been
[2:25:28.320 --> 2:25:32.120]  trafficked or abused it becomes satanic and so you're taking it's an
[2:25:32.120 --> 2:25:36.120]  inversion again of something holy exactly and then that takes you over
[2:25:36.120 --> 2:25:40.400]  either through literal demons through dark energy call it what you will but
[2:25:40.400 --> 2:25:43.840]  you're consuming negative karma so I like to just think that I don't want to
[2:25:43.840 --> 2:25:48.080]  consume negative karma I can't live a perfect life I use an iPhone that the
[2:25:48.080 --> 2:25:52.680]  karma attached to using Apple devices we all know that that becomes part of the
[2:25:52.680 --> 2:25:56.240]  death that we have to pay forward because there's that's based on human
[2:25:56.240 --> 2:26:00.200]  suffering right so much of the world is based on human suffering why do they
[2:26:00.200 --> 2:26:03.280]  build them in slave factories it's not just about greed they want to be a
[2:26:03.280 --> 2:26:06.600]  satanic instrument right and they want it because they want to create negative
[2:26:06.600 --> 2:26:10.760]  karma so their their role in the world is to create more negative karma because
[2:26:10.760 --> 2:26:15.000]  then everybody carries heavier karmic debt as a construct they use as a handle
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:19.200]  on right and then we can't ascend to the higher levels because now we're all
[2:26:19.200 --> 2:26:22.120]  burdened on with this karmic debt so every time it looks like we're about to
[2:26:22.120 --> 2:26:25.520]  go to a higher level we get pulled down into the lower level because of all the
[2:26:25.520 --> 2:26:29.560]  negative karma that's why a lot of the the darker entities help people who are
[2:26:29.560 --> 2:26:33.840]  doing the dark work they give them insights and vision because they're
[2:26:33.840 --> 2:26:38.360]  able to create more negativity that holds us down and that's why we haven't
[2:26:38.360 --> 2:26:42.080]  transcended to a higher level they're sucking us into their dimension and now
[2:26:42.080 --> 2:26:46.560]  the metaverse is an artificial synthetic subdivision of the third dimension as
[2:26:46.560 --> 2:26:51.080]  well yeah that's why the metaverse is going to be so popular because people
[2:26:51.080 --> 2:26:55.040]  are we already live in the metaverse right social media is augmented
[2:26:55.040 --> 2:26:58.560]  reality somebody reads something about you on social media and they come about
[2:26:58.560 --> 2:27:01.800]  it now ask you in real life if that's true or not so we already live in the
[2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:06.760]  metaverse that's why absolutely now they want to completely bring you in it and
[2:27:06.760 --> 2:27:10.160]  then people can be tortured and taunted in ways that maybe they're not prepared
[2:27:10.160 --> 2:27:16.240]  for but there you and I are lucky because we're Gen X and we don't have a full
[2:27:16.240 --> 2:27:20.720]  hold on our minds the way younger people do but that's that's coming up so we're
[2:27:20.720 --> 2:27:27.200]  sort of the last of the Mohicans in terms of having a fully free mind it's
[2:27:27.200 --> 2:27:32.640]  still a ways till break but man how far do you think they're gonna push this and
[2:27:32.640 --> 2:27:35.560]  go I mean that I mean with the poison shots all of it it's just they're
[2:27:35.560 --> 2:27:41.960]  already openly attacking everybody well evil has no limit right they has no
[2:27:41.960 --> 2:27:46.080]  bottom you know yeah there's never what Stalin did they want to do here what
[2:27:46.080 --> 2:27:49.960]  Mao did with the Cambodian genocide Pol Pot did they want to do here what
[2:27:49.960 --> 2:27:55.800]  Hitler did they want to do here there's no limit that said evil does because it
[2:27:55.800 --> 2:28:00.480]  is evil so the root of its own destruction the problem is an expiration
[2:28:00.480 --> 2:28:04.000]  date yeah the problem is all the human suffering that happens in between those
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:10.080]  waves of evil and what we have to do is try to prevent the evil from happening
[2:28:10.080 --> 2:28:15.320]  or limit the stretch or the length of the wave that's going to happen that's
[2:28:15.320 --> 2:28:18.680]  why I've got big big big pictures of waves all over the office yeah let's
[2:28:18.680 --> 2:28:23.400]  probably something coming in from from God or the universe telling you that
[2:28:23.400 --> 2:28:28.040]  everything is a wave good as a wave evils a wave the wave of evil is coming and
[2:28:28.040 --> 2:28:32.160]  you can't stop it totally but maybe we can make the wave a little bit less
[2:28:32.160 --> 2:28:36.200]  powerful make it crust down the hatches yeah and you have to lean into it I've
[2:28:36.200 --> 2:28:39.640]  been telling that people for a long time is you have to you don't want to run
[2:28:39.640 --> 2:28:42.760]  from evil that yeah you got to face it that on you have to fortify your mind
[2:28:42.760 --> 2:28:46.760]  you have to fortify your body it's no joke things they're gonna get worse
[2:28:46.760 --> 2:28:51.560]  because people go ho sernovich you're always telling people things are gonna
[2:28:51.560 --> 2:28:55.840]  get worse but you're an optimist so let's talk about that when we come back if
[2:28:55.840 --> 2:29:00.880]  you're concerned about the power there are so many crappy brands of energy
[2:29:00.880 --> 2:29:06.160]  products energy drinks energy powders energy pills and look almost all of them
[2:29:06.160 --> 2:29:12.720]  work but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides horrible crashes and
[2:29:12.720 --> 2:29:19.040]  again so many toxins so all of the new tropic products that we sell at info

[2:29:55.280 --> 2:30:03.080]  funds the info war a 360 win what our champions made of here's a man who can
[2:30:03.080 --> 2:30:09.080]  show you
[2:30:33.080 --> 2:31:02.160]  the CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the
[2:31:02.160 --> 2:31:07.880]  vaccines are working for quote dark forces that the FBI and CIA have been
[2:31:07.880 --> 2:31:13.920]  advising him on who these evil groups are they know that all over the world
[2:31:13.920 --> 2:31:18.420]  their poison shot is being banned by major governments and Moderna's in
[2:31:18.420 --> 2:31:22.880]  trouble as well they know that the people are starting to get wise this
[2:31:22.880 --> 2:31:27.600]  depopulation agenda in fact evidence is starting to mount that the shots were
[2:31:27.600 --> 2:31:31.640]  supposed to be soft-kill weapons but they're so deadly they're killing a
[2:31:31.640 --> 2:31:37.880]  higher percentage up front and so people are waking up the weapons work a
[2:31:37.880 --> 2:31:42.320]  little too good they're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars but
[2:31:42.320 --> 2:31:46.680]  instead they're making too big of a noise but it's too late for return back
[2:31:46.680 --> 2:31:51.280]  now they're coming after our children so it's up to us to protect our little
[2:31:51.280 --> 2:31:57.720]  children or God will not look favorably on us remember God is watching if your
[2:31:57.720 --> 2:32:01.960]  ruthless mega corporations have taken over almost every government on earth
[2:32:01.960 --> 2:32:05.760]  and who are trying to destroy the middle class and any form of upper
[2:32:05.760 --> 2:32:09.360]  mobility you've got to divide and conquer the public so they don't know
[2:32:09.360 --> 2:32:13.760]  they're being targeted that's why the fortune 100 have wrapped themselves
[2:32:13.760 --> 2:32:18.440]  the name of LBGT and African-American rights all the rest of it all over the
[2:32:18.440 --> 2:32:22.600]  world that's now their corporate face while they run slave camps in Africa and
[2:32:22.600 --> 2:32:26.440]  in communist China and many other areas while they undermine our basic
[2:32:26.440 --> 2:32:30.640]  liberties here and spy on us through the big tech the central banks and other
[2:32:30.640 --> 2:32:36.800]  zone so this is a criminal takeover and when you look at the new superclass it's
[2:32:36.800 --> 2:32:41.480]  the politicians it's the corporate media it's the police it's the bureaucrats
[2:32:41.480 --> 2:32:44.680]  it's members of Congress and their staff and their families it's the White House
[2:32:44.680 --> 2:32:51.360]  hell it's postal workers who were all exempt from the poison shots but not the
[2:32:51.360 --> 2:32:55.000]  general public and everybody else through corporate rule so this is the true
[2:32:55.000 --> 2:32:58.120]  discrimination that's going on
[2:32:59.480 --> 2:33:04.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:33:11.440 --> 2:33:21.760]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide
[2:33:21.760 --> 2:33:26.040]  it's Alex Jones
[2:33:32.960 --> 2:33:37.200]  well Mike Sernovich is a smart guy you know some of the stuff he's telling me
[2:33:37.200 --> 2:33:42.000]  behind the scenes is exactly my view on things and it's it's a crazy world so
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:47.360]  well I've got so many questions and so many places to go but guys you just gave
[2:33:47.360 --> 2:33:51.760]  me that article here it is this is so huge this is out of Reuters UK health
[2:33:51.760 --> 2:33:57.760]  agency extends gap between infection and shots for children and they're now
[2:33:57.760 --> 2:34:01.360]  saying that you should wait three months between taking the COVID vaccine
[2:34:01.360 --> 2:34:05.240]  because when you take the second shot it has a massive increase of myocarditis
[2:34:05.240 --> 2:34:09.080]  as the British Medical Journal said three weeks ago so this is a big big
[2:34:09.080 --> 2:34:11.520]  deal and Reuters tries to spin the headline where it doesn't make any sense
[2:34:11.520 --> 2:34:15.280]  but when you actually read into it they're saying three months now not two
[2:34:15.280 --> 2:34:19.720]  weeks between shots what do you make of that well it's all coming to pass really
[2:34:19.720 --> 2:34:25.000]  the the lies the if you want to look at something interesting before Wikipedia
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:28.720]  deletes it because there's accidentally truth being there look at deaths of
[2:34:28.720 --> 2:34:35.760]  Fifa players the amount of deaths among soccer players from 2020 2020 2021
[2:34:35.760 --> 2:34:40.840]  to before that interesting data I would like to see people track this
[2:34:40.840 --> 2:34:45.520]  objectively because the question is a headline is a headline right we know
[2:34:45.520 --> 2:34:50.200]  that athletes are having to leave the season we know that they're passing out
[2:34:50.200 --> 2:34:54.160]  we know that some of them are dying but does that happen every year there's
[2:34:54.160 --> 2:34:57.480]  always been the case they're dying every day though yeah well that we we need to
[2:34:57.480 --> 2:35:00.240]  look at the numbers and nobody's tracking the numbers and that's an
[2:35:00.240 --> 2:35:06.040]  interesting research project for people to undergo because it seems like it's
[2:35:06.040 --> 2:35:10.240]  more it does it does seem like it's more but we don't know we need to have a
[2:35:10.240 --> 2:35:13.840]  baseline rate if we want to be logical we have to say well how many professional
[2:35:13.840 --> 2:35:19.280]  athletes drop dead or had heart conditions in 2019 2018 2017 and then
[2:35:19.280 --> 2:35:23.960]  compare that to 2020 some investigative reporters are saying it's a 66% increase
[2:35:23.960 --> 2:35:27.120]  some other numbers that have been broken down wouldn't surprise me from what I'm
[2:35:27.120 --> 2:35:31.720]  saying I mean 66 times you can go on Wikipedia and you can look up Fifa
[2:35:31.720 --> 2:35:37.760]  player deaths and they list a prominent number of yeah so yeah the Fifa I think
[2:35:37.760 --> 2:35:42.600]  is Fifa or FiFA I think they had a list that somebody posted where you can see
[2:35:42.600 --> 2:35:47.240]  how many people have died yeah they're saying it's a 500% increase it wouldn't
[2:35:47.240 --> 2:35:50.560]  wouldn't surprise me I wouldn't really be surprised by any of that I mean look
[2:35:50.560 --> 2:35:54.440]  I mean they put on these shots now it can make you have a heart attack or have
[2:35:54.440 --> 2:35:57.760]  heart swelling but then they on the news like it's a conspiracy no one ever got
[2:35:57.760 --> 2:36:04.040]  sick I mean it's these corporations are crazy well they want profit Pfizer sold
[2:36:04.040 --> 2:36:08.360]  what Vioxx didn't they was that was that Pfizer Pfizer's had to enter into
[2:36:08.360 --> 2:36:12.840]  non-prosecution agreements with the government the most fine pharmacy I
[2:36:12.840 --> 2:36:16.120]  mean big pharma company so I want to know when the left I thought it was
[2:36:16.120 --> 2:36:19.800]  interesting when did the left come from there's the iron triangle there's that
[2:36:19.800 --> 2:36:24.080]  revolving door of you work at the pharmaceutical company then you work at
[2:36:24.080 --> 2:36:28.720]  the FDA and you get stock options they don't care anymore so now they all love
[2:36:28.720 --> 2:36:33.880]  big pharma they're they're moving to technology all I can here's what I look
[2:36:33.880 --> 2:36:40.720]  at the situation they are they being the left they are taking the vaccine they
[2:36:40.720 --> 2:36:44.920]  clearly believe in it we'll see what happens because if they're wrong their
[2:36:44.920 --> 2:36:50.160]  numbers will dwindle and if they're right then the numbers of patriotic
[2:36:50.160 --> 2:36:54.160]  freedom-loving Americans will will dwindle and it's like a religion to
[2:36:54.160 --> 2:36:59.680]  them it's like they really believe in the cult Joe Rogan said that the other
[2:36:59.680 --> 2:37:02.920]  not on Tim Poole show that the left has really become a cult and Joe we saw
[2:37:02.920 --> 2:37:07.320]  himself as very liberal he says these aren't liberals this is a cult well
[2:37:07.320 --> 2:37:10.840]  they're they're called the big pharma they're only they have hate that's what
[2:37:10.840 --> 2:37:15.080]  fundamentally it comes down to us the left has always been collective and if
[2:37:15.080 --> 2:37:19.280]  you're a collectivist you're always gonna have to hate the other and now they
[2:37:19.280 --> 2:37:23.640]  have the new other which is anybody who's on vaccinate they want to ban
[2:37:23.640 --> 2:37:28.120]  people from not being vaccinated when I read their stuff though it shows it's
[2:37:28.120 --> 2:37:33.600]  sad I saw a doctor who claims he's a data-driven MD he claims that he doesn't
[2:37:33.600 --> 2:37:37.120]  take a son to the grocery store the three-year-old son he has never been to
[2:37:37.120 --> 2:37:40.440]  a grocery store because they're so afraid of COVID and I think about the
[2:37:40.440 --> 2:37:45.080]  children we're suffering if left-wingers if Chris Hayes wants I want all the
[2:37:45.080 --> 2:37:49.280]  liberal media people to take the vaccine I know I agree but then there but then
[2:37:49.280 --> 2:37:52.120]  we got to fill for their children yeah that's what I mean I feel bad for the
[2:37:52.120 --> 2:37:57.520]  children who are gonna be used as test subjects so that Pfizer can't enrich
[2:37:57.520 --> 2:38:01.640]  itself with no risk of liability because you can't sue Pfizer for the
[2:38:01.640 --> 2:38:05.280]  vaccine side effects the whole world has been turned into a giant laboratory I'm
[2:38:05.280 --> 2:38:09.040]  sure you've seen this but it's even in the Washington Post Pfizer got secret
[2:38:09.040 --> 2:38:11.840]  agreements more than 50 governments including the US government we know
[2:38:11.840 --> 2:38:15.880]  because of the documents have now been released and Pfizer has the power to
[2:38:15.880 --> 2:38:20.800]  silence government officials and that the US military bases and others have
[2:38:20.800 --> 2:38:25.920]  been pledged as collateral in case there's any liability but they're also
[2:38:25.920 --> 2:38:29.440]  given liability waivers and then of course Brazil wouldn't go along with it
[2:38:29.440 --> 2:38:35.160]  secret vaccine contracts so the government did treaties with Pfizer to
[2:38:35.160 --> 2:38:38.080]  basically give them dictatorial power and that's why the Pfizer CEO goes on TV
[2:38:38.080 --> 2:38:41.440]  and says oh no the FDA will approve it for children and then they do it because
[2:38:41.440 --> 2:38:46.040]  he's in command he's in command and what the FDA say it's gonna take 55 years
[2:38:46.040 --> 2:38:50.960]  before they release the full data it's a farce honestly it's a farce and on the
[2:38:50.960 --> 2:38:55.080]  farce and then that ties into this they exercise in federal court they say we
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:39:00.040]  are in control right and they said so 55 years so my perspective on all of this
[2:39:00.040 --> 2:39:04.880]  is and I've said this before you just have to separate yourselves from these
[2:39:04.880 --> 2:39:08.560]  people that's why I live my life now I don't know that I have I used to have a
[2:39:08.560 --> 2:39:11.880]  lot of friends who are liberals a lot of friends who are Democrats I don't know if
[2:39:11.880 --> 2:39:16.680]  I have a friend anymore who is because they're part of a cult a demonic cult
[2:39:16.680 --> 2:39:20.960]  and I don't want to be associated with that so I'm focusing on building up
[2:39:20.960 --> 2:39:24.120]  relationships with people who are not friends of mine have the vaccine by the
[2:39:24.120 --> 2:39:28.960]  way because if you're you know if you're an obese person then you're playing the
[2:39:28.960 --> 2:39:32.160]  odds either way so you're gonna have a harder experience with COVID so I
[2:39:32.160 --> 2:39:36.680]  actually got in a lot of trouble with my reader base because I said look man if
[2:39:36.680 --> 2:39:41.080]  you're not actively taking care of your health and you get COVID it's gonna be a
[2:39:41.080 --> 2:39:45.240]  bad ride and sure it does work for three or four months but after six months you
[2:39:45.240 --> 2:39:48.400]  have lower immunity than you have before it's not a vaccine it's a gene
[2:39:48.400 --> 2:39:51.720]  therapy drug that that's why I would say nobody should take it but I get it you're
[2:39:51.720 --> 2:39:54.560]  just saying hey it's your choice just don't make it yeah yeah I have friends
[2:39:54.560 --> 2:39:58.320]  who are vaccinated and I'll be friends with the vaccinated people I have friends
[2:39:58.320 --> 2:40:01.040]  who are Trump supporters who are vaccinated because they have weight
[2:40:01.040 --> 2:40:04.800]  issues or their immunocompromised from some other condition and COVID could
[2:40:04.800 --> 2:40:09.200]  really be a problem oh I mean I had it and people got bad at me saying it was
[2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:12.840]  deadly I felt like a gorilla was on my chest it was sick as I almost killed my
[2:40:12.840 --> 2:40:18.520]  dad and it was damn real yeah I'd never had felt like this was not the flow this
[2:40:18.520 --> 2:40:22.760]  was not a cold this was synthetic yeah two friends of my wife they're the
[2:40:22.760 --> 2:40:27.640]  healthiest people we know and the it's a husband wife couple the husband's
[2:40:27.640 --> 2:40:31.960]  super physically active really lean he said it doesn't feel natural he said I
[2:40:31.960 --> 2:40:38.040]  thought that the lab theory of COVID was crazy until I got it according to him
[2:40:38.040 --> 2:40:41.880]  this is him talking me talking for him he said it doesn't feel natural it felt
[2:40:41.880 --> 2:40:44.840]  everybody says that I mean when you're 50 almost 50 like I am right every I've
[2:40:44.840 --> 2:40:47.560]  been sick you know I know what it feels like oh this is the flu this is a cold
[2:40:47.560 --> 2:40:53.680]  this is like this is this is new I mean you know at 3 3 a.m. is when it and
[2:40:53.680 --> 2:40:58.560]  that's what the doctor Bartlett told me he said at 3 a.m. when you have the real
[2:40:58.560 --> 2:41:02.760]  trouble breathing don't panic just go to the bedesta on steroid then exactly at
[2:41:02.760 --> 2:41:05.880]  3 a.m. when you get would just this stuff's designed it says well we know
[2:41:05.880 --> 2:41:09.440]  it's a synthetic spike protein rep that's a replicating nanotech that's why
[2:41:09.440 --> 2:41:13.760]  big tech and big pharma are merging is because these new quote vaccines are
[2:41:13.760 --> 2:41:17.400]  really just digital manufactured nanotech I mean so that's why the two
[2:41:17.400 --> 2:41:21.080]  are merging because this is this is programming well the two most important
[2:41:21.080 --> 2:41:25.040]  books I think people should read to understand the current zeitgeist would
[2:41:25.040 --> 2:41:29.520]  be snow crab both Neil Stevenson books snow crash and the diamond age that's
[2:41:29.520 --> 2:41:33.280]  because Neil Stevenson is a sci-fi writer who's very beloved by people in tech
[2:41:33.280 --> 2:41:38.640]  and snow crash is about the metaverse so a lot of what is happening now in tech
[2:41:38.640 --> 2:41:42.600]  came from Neil Stevenson's work they're able to bring the tech and so in snow
[2:41:42.600 --> 2:41:46.800]  crash everybody plugs in to what is essentially the metaverse and then the
[2:41:46.800 --> 2:41:50.640]  diamond age is all about nanotechnology and nanobots
[2:41:50.640 --> 2:41:54.480]  nano contamination killing people via nanobots having your blood explode via
[2:41:54.480 --> 2:41:58.680]  nanobots so I've told people for years you should read snow crash and the
[2:41:58.680 --> 2:42:03.640]  diamond age because that's almost like a playbook for what tech is doing and
[2:42:03.640 --> 2:42:06.360]  where the technology and I'm sure you saw two weeks after the Davos group
[2:42:06.360 --> 2:42:10.800]  announced it a month ago two weeks ago the USDA says we're gonna start spraying
[2:42:10.800 --> 2:42:15.480]  food with nanotech for your safety it's just there it's a revolution even though
[2:42:15.480 --> 2:42:18.520]  when general Flynn said that they would be doing that a month ago there was a
[2:42:18.520 --> 2:42:22.000]  whole outcry from the media where they said general Flynn is a conspiracy
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:25.800]  theorist he's claiming that they're gonna put nanotechnology and salad dressing
[2:42:25.800 --> 2:42:30.120]  and that became a whole that's the world we're in now where they attack you for
[2:42:30.120 --> 2:42:33.200]  saying what they're gonna do and then they do it and they pretend like they
[2:42:33.200 --> 2:42:38.040]  didn't attack us USDA but we put it back on screen alright Mike Cernovich is

[2:47:20.440 --> 2:47:25.200]  you know what mark zuckerberg's doing it came out more than five years ago in his
[2:47:25.200 --> 2:47:29.760]  own company documents when whistleblowers warned the world that he was
[2:47:29.760 --> 2:47:34.200]  trying to isolate people to be only on facebook and to be depressed and alone
[2:47:34.200 --> 2:47:38.760]  so that avatars or fake computer entities would be their only friends
[2:47:38.760 --> 2:47:44.240]  thus taking full control of the user's mind that's just a beta test for what's
[2:47:44.240 --> 2:47:49.840]  now rolling out with facebook claiming ownership of the metaverse and buying up
[2:47:49.840 --> 2:47:55.280]  hundreds of VR companies and now trying to force its users and employees to
[2:47:55.280 --> 2:48:00.920]  solely live in a fantasy world controlled and orchestrated by zuckerberg and the
[2:48:00.920 --> 2:48:05.760]  organizations that he works with this priest class wants to lock us in our
[2:48:05.760 --> 2:48:09.560]  five senses here in the third dimension and to do that they're creating an
[2:48:09.560 --> 2:48:17.480]  artificial electronic prison or matrix to seduce us into giving up control of
[2:48:17.480 --> 2:48:23.120]  our bodies and our minds this is the greatest deception ever evil is digging
[2:48:23.120 --> 2:48:27.960]  in because it knows humanity is waking up and the group consciousness is forming
[2:48:27.960 --> 2:48:32.840]  and that we are beginning to transcend the third dimension everything that's
[2:48:32.840 --> 2:48:37.200]  being launched against us is an attempt to hold us in the third dimension and
[2:48:37.200 --> 2:48:42.200]  not just enslave us but finally completely destroy us and absorb our
[2:48:42.200 --> 2:48:47.680]  energy into this system they're building this is beyond the satanic richwood this
[2:48:47.680 --> 2:48:51.640]  is beyond anything you've read about science fiction because this is actually
[2:48:51.640 --> 2:48:56.360]  happening in the real world today and we have discovered their secrets we've
[2:48:56.360 --> 2:49:00.280]  discovered how to stop them and we have put it all together in an easy to
[2:49:00.280 --> 2:49:05.320]  understand system that gives you the tools to not just defeat the globalist but
[2:49:05.320 --> 2:49:10.320]  to transcend to the next level it's so important for all of you that already
[2:49:10.320 --> 2:49:13.400]  know this innate and have already witnesses for yourselves to understand
[2:49:13.400 --> 2:49:18.160]  you are the leaders of the future that must go to the next level so that you
[2:49:18.160 --> 2:49:22.920]  and I and others working together can free the rest of humanity before they
[2:49:22.920 --> 2:49:26.760]  get trapped in this artificial matrix systems the globalist are building all
[2:49:26.760 --> 2:49:30.440]  I'm offering is the truth the film the matrix made 1999 is not original
[2:49:30.440 --> 2:49:36.320]  documents came out in 1990 from the late 1970s where NASA and DARPA were
[2:49:36.320 --> 2:49:41.400]  developing a plan very similar to the matrix and all that information is now
[2:49:41.400 --> 2:49:46.640]  public they're attempting to seduce us to give up our five senses not just
[2:49:46.640 --> 2:49:50.360]  holding us a third dimension but actually creating an artificial slave
[2:49:50.360 --> 2:49:55.600]  system so that they can turn us into their programmable slaves humanity are
[2:49:55.600 --> 2:49:59.480]  not robots no matter how many times Ray Kurzweil and the social engineers tell
[2:49:59.480 --> 2:50:04.920]  us this but they are trying to turn us into robots that's why in December of
[2:50:04.920 --> 2:50:12.640]  2021 we are launching reset find out more information at resetwars.com
[2:50:15.480 --> 2:50:22.800]  resetwars.com Mike Cernovich riding shotgun and now coming into the fray
[2:50:22.800 --> 2:50:28.600]  Tim Pool of Temcasts one of the most popular podcast in the world and a guy
[2:50:28.600 --> 2:50:32.080]  that when I was being censored nobody else would have me on had me on had the
[2:50:32.080 --> 2:50:35.960]  courage to do it so we really appreciate Tim Pool and he also of course
[2:50:35.960 --> 2:50:39.640]  famously on Joe Rogan defended me to the head of Twitter that was epic and
[2:50:39.640 --> 2:50:42.880]  amazing and that was a big turning point so thanks for the live for AFP told me
[2:50:42.880 --> 2:50:45.360]  hey I didn't do it for you I did it for everybody's free speech we're all
[2:50:45.360 --> 2:50:49.360]  in this together so Tim Pool is here with us thanks for having me man good to
[2:50:49.360 --> 2:50:53.400]  have you here how you like an Austin I have eaten nothing but brisket this
[2:50:53.400 --> 2:50:56.920]  past week as that is not a joke that is that is true and serious and I've loved
[2:50:56.920 --> 2:51:03.640]  every every bite you've been having some epic interviews to Tuesday we're gonna
[2:51:03.640 --> 2:51:06.280]  talk about rid the house some next hour but you want to talk about metaverse
[2:51:06.280 --> 2:51:09.160]  that's where we were with the great Cernovich well yeah you just played that
[2:51:09.160 --> 2:51:14.480]  clip and I basically said the metaverse will happen and everyone's going to
[2:51:14.480 --> 2:51:17.920]  celebrate it you know we can sit here right now and talk about the
[2:51:17.920 --> 2:51:23.800]  intrusions on our individual rights our liberties our our worldview our values
[2:51:23.800 --> 2:51:27.520]  but I think about how the fact I know we got social security numbers right we
[2:51:27.520 --> 2:51:30.600]  are literally tagged and numbered by the government and we all just we don't
[2:51:30.600 --> 2:51:33.760]  complain about that every day do we we don't go isn't it crazy the government
[2:51:33.760 --> 2:51:37.680]  has given us a number you're born and then already in the metaverse well what
[2:51:37.680 --> 2:51:41.920]  I mean is I mean first of all the way we use Facebook the way we use social
[2:51:41.920 --> 2:51:45.720]  media we're hooked in we're wired but I think you know Mark Zuckerberg is gonna
[2:51:45.720 --> 2:51:49.640]  do the metaverse if it's not him it's somebody else you give it 10 15 20 years
[2:51:49.640 --> 2:51:52.680]  the next generation they're gonna grow up living in that world and they're not
[2:51:52.680 --> 2:51:56.760]  going to understand why we oppose it absolutely so we see it as alien and
[2:51:56.760 --> 2:52:01.080]  nauseating and in a hellhole and and not real because when you travel the stone
[2:52:01.080 --> 2:52:03.720]  ends you pick up the energy when you go there via the metaverse it's not the
[2:52:03.720 --> 2:52:07.600]  same thing it's alive but but then our children forced into this that's what
[2:52:07.600 --> 2:52:11.000]  the whole reset is making us you know zoom in and do all this they won't know
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:13.520]  the difference Mike it'll be if we let him in yeah it'll be
[2:52:13.520 --> 2:52:17.520]  indistinguishable from reality and of course a joke I'm not not the joke but
[2:52:17.520 --> 2:52:20.360]  Elon and others we could already be in a we could already be in a metaverse and
[2:52:20.360 --> 2:52:24.440]  I know it like how do we know we're at base reality right now right I was a
[2:52:24.440 --> 2:52:28.280]  vision you know next level consciousness yeah I mean I definitely have had next
[2:52:28.280 --> 2:52:31.640]  level consciousness experience isn't that an argument that we're not in base
[2:52:31.640 --> 2:52:36.040]  reality no well that's the third dimensional reality is is is what
[2:52:36.040 --> 2:52:39.440]  you're talking about but there is there's the higher dimensions so would it
[2:52:39.440 --> 2:52:42.960]  not be that we initiate we re-originate in the higher dimensions and right now
[2:52:42.960 --> 2:52:46.160]  we are trapped in a lower dimension yes well this body is a manifestation of our
[2:52:46.160 --> 2:52:50.680]  incredible will in the fourth fifth sixth seventh of the 11th dimension or or it
[2:52:50.680 --> 2:52:55.920]  could be that were souls and we were brought in here to play this reality
[2:52:55.920 --> 2:53:00.320]  because the reality we came from is so beautiful and divine that it got boring
[2:53:00.320 --> 2:53:03.960]  but then we needed that's what it is exactly that's what I saw that would
[2:53:03.960 --> 2:53:07.160]  mean that we're in the metaverse right at the end of the third dimension is a
[2:53:07.160 --> 2:53:10.920]  metaverse right this entire universe is a simulation that the God created is
[2:53:10.920 --> 2:53:14.280]  holding together they now know with the with the different devices that there
[2:53:14.280 --> 2:53:18.320]  is a force five times stronger holding this this universe together here's what
[2:53:18.320 --> 2:53:23.480]  I know I know that through experiences I've had with various plant medicines
[2:53:23.480 --> 2:53:28.960]  that wherever you go feels more real than this world so people go because
[2:53:28.960 --> 2:53:32.160]  that's why I hate when people go I was just a hallucinogen this is the
[2:53:32.160 --> 2:53:38.160]  hallucination when you go to the other dimensions you immediately feel I'm back
[2:53:38.160 --> 2:53:43.160]  home everybody talks about exactly this is familiar so this will completion yeah
[2:53:43.160 --> 2:53:48.560]  this world is the hologram this world is a hallucination we belong somewhere else
[2:53:48.560 --> 2:53:52.800]  now why we're here that's the riddle of existence right why were we put here
[2:53:52.800 --> 2:53:56.040]  what are we supposed to do while we're here well we have to be battle tested
[2:53:56.040 --> 2:53:59.560]  yeah that's the riddle so we're already in the metaverse in my view this is a
[2:53:59.560 --> 2:54:03.680]  torture device so we can decide who we are what if it's just a video game right
[2:54:03.680 --> 2:54:08.280]  what if it's just entertainment now we haven't decided what it is and I've
[2:54:08.280 --> 2:54:12.800]  definitely it's it's it's a war training it's it's a it's a war training
[2:54:12.800 --> 2:54:18.680]  grid for a giant war going on that we've not been led into yet but I've got to
[2:54:18.680 --> 2:54:22.160]  look at it wow I mean that's there's a bunch of different ways you can look at
[2:54:22.160 --> 2:54:26.400]  it just say this I I agree that my brain releases a lot of DMT when I sleep
[2:54:26.400 --> 2:54:29.400]  everybody does but I've released large amounts of it every night I go to sleep
[2:54:29.400 --> 2:54:32.880]  it's like longer than my life here and so every night it's just like total you
[2:54:32.880 --> 2:54:36.000]  know just all over the place I'm just I'm just thinking about how insane the
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:38.560]  news cycle has been over the past few years to the point where people have
[2:54:38.560 --> 2:54:44.080]  jokingly said the writers of reality you know are reusing jokes because like the
[2:54:44.080 --> 2:54:46.800]  same things are happening and it's like getting stale or whatever yeah the
[2:54:46.800 --> 2:54:50.120]  timeline it's yeah like oh this is the craziest timeline where the large
[2:54:50.120 --> 2:54:54.120]  hadron collider slams the particles warping earth into the Trump dimension
[2:54:54.120 --> 2:54:57.520]  where he's president and I'm like if that's your argument it sounds like base
[2:54:57.520 --> 2:55:01.760]  reality is probably super routine and boring so we created this this crazy
[2:55:01.760 --> 2:55:06.600]  reality where everything's just shocking and outrageous we got this crazy trial
[2:55:06.600 --> 2:55:09.760]  going out because because at higher levels things are so complete and
[2:55:09.760 --> 2:55:13.440]  controlled you would want to go back down into chaos or we're traveling
[2:55:13.440 --> 2:55:18.240]  through space already and because of the long periods of time in between space
[2:55:18.240 --> 2:55:23.080]  travel you have to go somewhere so you're simulating your brain up yeah so
[2:55:23.080 --> 2:55:27.480]  we're just here because I got that I got that idea when Elon Musk was on Joe
[2:55:27.480 --> 2:55:31.520]  Rogan and Elon said if you play video games because real life can be boring
[2:55:31.520 --> 2:55:36.440]  then imagine how boring the people who create the simulation must be right
[2:55:36.440 --> 2:55:40.640]  because to them we play video game as escapism because real life can be boring
[2:55:40.640 --> 2:55:44.440]  but if you're doing massive space travel you have to keep your brain
[2:55:44.440 --> 2:55:48.160]  activated like you're plugged into some kind of fluid and then you come here and
[2:55:48.160 --> 2:55:52.040]  then whoop you wake up and now you're back into space I know that either like
[2:55:52.040 --> 2:55:54.960]  all the globalist billionaires obviously none of them are atheists they all know
[2:55:54.960 --> 2:55:58.600]  that we were designed and built and yes they believe that we are actually trapped
[2:55:58.600 --> 2:56:02.920]  in in a false reality and they're like Lucifer trying to break out against
[2:56:02.920 --> 2:56:06.080]  this thing that's imprisoned us and once they become gods they will be able to
[2:56:06.080 --> 2:56:09.160]  break us out the problem is is that they're they're acting like demons
[2:56:09.160 --> 2:56:12.840]  against us so that we don't compete with them and controlling the future they're
[2:56:12.840 --> 2:56:16.320]  doing horrible things to us so I say they're the bad that that I think that's
[2:56:16.320 --> 2:56:21.360]  where you and I one of the only things we fundamentally disagree on is I don't
[2:56:21.360 --> 2:56:24.920]  think these billionaires are getting direct downloads from the universe and
[2:56:24.920 --> 2:56:29.320]  through the higher powers I've met more than a few no I agree with you so I
[2:56:29.320 --> 2:56:32.760]  don't so I think with Bill Gates acts this way I don't think he's acting via
[2:56:32.760 --> 2:56:37.040]  divine machination I believe that he's just a normal person who got rich doing
[2:56:37.040 --> 2:56:40.280]  it was doing because he had IQ misunderstood what I said no no no I
[2:56:40.280 --> 2:56:43.760]  obviously Bill Gates is a low-level demon and because he's willing to fill
[2:56:43.760 --> 2:56:47.080]  that role he's there I agree with you when I'm saying ish a lot of the
[2:56:47.080 --> 2:56:50.040]  billionaires that the head of Bank of America years ago said I believe it's
[2:56:50.040 --> 2:56:53.160]  all a simulation and ice being atheists now that I looked at all the science
[2:56:53.160 --> 2:56:56.960]  something's controlling us and I want to break out of it and I'm saying that
[2:56:56.960 --> 2:56:59.880]  that goes back to Lucifer wanting to build his own universe I got an
[2:56:59.880 --> 2:57:04.680]  interesting segue for you you guys ever watch Stargate SG-1 no but you told me
[2:57:04.680 --> 2:57:07.080]  about I want to watch it there's an episode where there's like a crashed
[2:57:07.080 --> 2:57:10.600]  spaceship they find and everyone's consciousness is removed from their body
[2:57:10.600 --> 2:57:15.160]  in deep space travel because the consciousness would degrade but so
[2:57:15.160 --> 2:57:17.400]  that's an interesting concept but it made me think of something else from the
[2:57:17.400 --> 2:57:21.520]  show called Tritonin in the plot of the show there's a medicine that when you
[2:57:21.520 --> 2:57:26.320]  take it it boosts it boosts your immune system but destroys it so as soon as you
[2:57:26.320 --> 2:57:29.440]  stop taking it you die from all these virus and that's what this does and
[2:57:29.440 --> 2:57:31.880]  this is it well I heard you guys talking about that and then this just kind of
[2:57:31.880 --> 2:57:35.040]  it's better back it's back in two minutes Tim I want to hear about this

[3:00:26.560 --> 3:00:31.520]  pretty powerful stuff so please continue you were these timelines Stargate SG-1
[3:00:31.520 --> 3:00:35.200]  amazing show it's like what's actually happening now I recently started
[3:00:35.200 --> 3:00:38.160]  watching this you're gonna you're gonna love some of these storylines so and
[3:00:38.160 --> 3:00:41.440]  this stuff is all written in the late 90s 2000s sci-fi TV show that was on I
[3:00:41.440 --> 3:00:46.640]  think it was on Showtime and one episode they discover this this planet
[3:00:46.640 --> 3:00:49.720]  basically they go to open a portal goes to different planets they go to a planet
[3:00:49.720 --> 3:00:56.200]  where this this race of humans discover something called Tritonin and it cures
[3:00:56.200 --> 3:00:59.720]  all of their diseases they have perfect immune systems but if they stop taking
[3:00:59.720 --> 3:01:04.040]  it they no longer have an immune system and they die it's like a spice is that
[3:01:04.040 --> 3:01:08.000]  what spice is like yeah yeah so so a lot of people point out you know you guys
[3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:11.560]  are talking about the vaccines and how afterwards there's a like waning waning
[3:01:11.560 --> 3:01:15.520]  general immune system I've not read that I don't know confirmed yet but it
[3:01:15.520 --> 3:01:19.240]  reminded me of Stargate there's another episode of Stargate where they go to
[3:01:19.240 --> 3:01:23.600]  this planet it's agrarian and there's an advanced race of humans that are
[3:01:23.600 --> 3:01:27.600]  harvesting crops through through the Stargate portals they found it there it
[3:01:27.600 --> 3:01:31.440]  is yeah that's Stargate SG-1 that's right and so check this out you're gonna
[3:01:31.440 --> 3:01:35.200]  love this one they go to this planet and they wonder why there's only a few
[3:01:35.200 --> 3:01:39.160]  farmers and these but but they're they're primitive and the advanced humans
[3:01:39.160 --> 3:01:42.960]  are harvesting all the crops and you guys found it keep showing it they take
[3:01:42.960 --> 3:01:48.000]  us out they find underground in like industrial era civilization but it's
[3:01:48.000 --> 3:01:52.520]  destroyed they find a newspaper and it says something in Gaelic because you
[3:01:52.520 --> 3:01:55.480]  know the plot the plot of the show is that different primitive humans
[3:01:55.480 --> 3:01:58.760]  traveled across the universe through these gates long story short they're
[3:01:58.760 --> 3:02:02.280]  trying to figure out what caused the collapse of the civilization well when
[3:02:02.280 --> 3:02:06.240]  the advanced aliens came to their planet there was a flu pandemic so they
[3:02:06.240 --> 3:02:11.440]  offered up a vaccine that would cure the pandemic and it also sterilized all of
[3:02:11.440 --> 3:02:15.600]  them that is not that is not a statement about the real world but have you guys
[3:02:15.600 --> 3:02:20.680]  also seen utopia on Amazon same story same story but this one's great a tech
[3:02:20.680 --> 3:02:24.240]  billionaire who's concerned about overpopulation who makes fake meat
[3:02:24.240 --> 3:02:29.320]  stages a fake pandemic so that he can rush through a vaccine without approval
[3:02:29.320 --> 3:02:33.040]  in a short amount of time and the state and the vaccine actually sterilizes
[3:02:33.040 --> 3:02:37.080]  everybody and Amazon canceled it after season one my understanding is they
[3:02:37.080 --> 3:02:40.960]  canceled it because people were getting freaked out well let's expand on that and
[3:02:40.960 --> 3:02:46.120]  what's even crazier is you realize it was made 15 years ago in the UK and then
[3:02:46.120 --> 3:02:50.240]  then got picked up by Amazon so that I wouldn't watch the original UK one or
[3:02:50.240 --> 3:02:54.080]  Lisa synopsis like you're boiled down and it was what's happening 15 years ago
[3:02:54.080 --> 3:02:59.360]  but but what's happening today so yeah it's Bill Gates fake meat everything it's
[3:02:59.360 --> 3:03:02.920]  just so weird there's there's there's art imitates life imitates art all over
[3:03:02.920 --> 3:03:07.000]  the place why did they do that why did they do that no I don't I don't I don't
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:10.880]  actually think I think it's probably his prediction programming well I'll tell you
[3:03:10.880 --> 3:03:14.480]  one more thing about utopia the plot the plot of the show is that someone was
[3:03:14.480 --> 3:03:18.760]  with private information creates a comic book that exposes what they're doing
[3:03:18.760 --> 3:03:23.120]  and the funny thing about that show is the show itself is effectively
[3:03:23.120 --> 3:03:26.080]  functioning as that comic book telling you what they're doing it's just the
[3:03:26.080 --> 3:03:30.160]  weirdest thing I think it's more that you draw inspiration from it rather than
[3:03:30.160 --> 3:03:34.360]  it being predictive programming I think I'm more of a believer in culture than I
[3:03:34.360 --> 3:03:41.120]  am conspiracy by that I mean if you're in if you were in tech all these big
[3:03:41.120 --> 3:03:44.800]  founders will say oh Neil Stevens is my favorite author so when Neil Stevenson
[3:03:44.800 --> 3:03:48.080]  writes no crash which is really about the metaverse I don't think it's
[3:03:48.080 --> 3:03:51.160]  predictive programming I think it's people thinking wow that could be really
[3:03:51.160 --> 3:03:55.640]  cool if we could create an alternative reality based on this book that I read
[3:03:55.640 --> 3:03:59.600]  no I totally agree with you that's what I'm saying is the globalist know that
[3:03:59.600 --> 3:04:03.200]  we're met God little G we're able to build whatever we imagine so they put
[3:04:03.200 --> 3:04:06.280]  out the science fiction knowing that becomes the dreams of humans that
[3:04:06.280 --> 3:04:10.160]  becomes reality yeah I don't I just think they're writing stories I don't know
[3:04:10.160 --> 3:04:15.640]  that it's necessarily as a to be like that I think it's just I I mean I when
[3:04:15.640 --> 3:04:20.160]  I said when I fought the globalist for 28 years I believe early on that they
[3:04:20.160 --> 3:04:23.000]  would launch their operations and because I've told people it was coming
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:26.840]  then we would be able to defeat them because we'd be on record beforehand
[3:04:26.840 --> 3:04:32.120]  yeah that's so I planned it okay okay well then maybe they're planning it too
[3:04:32.120 --> 3:04:36.920]  I I think it's more organic than that and I think that a lot of what you did was
[3:04:36.920 --> 3:04:42.560]  warning people of bad things to come but that's more creating culture than it is
[3:04:42.560 --> 3:04:46.200]  doing pretty good explain to explain culture versus conspiracy when we come
[3:04:46.200 --> 3:04:52.360]  back in 60 seconds with Tim pool and Mike Sarnovich Tim cast calm and folks
[3:04:52.360 --> 3:04:57.600]  movie calm that's right we'll be right back info wars so when I first started
[3:04:57.600 --> 3:05:02.160]  taking survival skill basically I was 275 pounds I was overweight I had brain
[3:05:02.160 --> 3:05:06.160]  fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I heard
[3:05:06.160 --> 3:05:09.360]  Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it so the first one I got was the
[3:05:09.360 --> 3:05:13.520]  original survival shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly
[3:05:13.520 --> 3:05:16.520]  thereafter you came out with that you had you know with a deep-burdened source
[3:05:16.520 --> 3:05:20.280]  you know and I got really excited about that so I took it and man in two weeks I
[3:05:20.280 --> 3:05:25.360]  went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know I
[3:05:25.360 --> 3:05:30.000]  could think again I could connect with people again and over the course of the
[3:05:30.000 --> 3:05:33.920]  next couple of years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all
[3:05:33.920 --> 3:05:37.280]  of your supplements there they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one
[3:05:37.280 --> 3:05:41.120]  I like recently as a knockout literally like if you want to sleep just take it
[3:05:41.120 --> 3:05:45.000]  it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean
[3:05:45.000 --> 3:05:48.800]  that's a break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to
[3:05:48.800 --> 3:05:53.080]  take our own health into our own hands beautifully said brother I thank you so
[3:05:53.080 --> 3:05:56.560]  much your call at Godspeed
[3:06:12.560 --> 3:06:16.400]  that's really good let's talk about doing first and we'll talk about the big
[3:06:16.400 --> 3:06:30.680]  written house developments you know that's got like hundreds of millions of
[3:06:30.680 --> 3:06:35.720]  years people remixing that short thing so I'm recording my own chant music in
[3:06:35.720 --> 3:06:41.560]  in in in Sardar car that I'm releasing nice I'm not joking I just want to have
[3:06:41.560 --> 3:06:46.000]  fun with it but you didn't think it was good no I walked out of the theater
[3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:50.800]  halfway through it was grating it was it was grating there were scenes that were
[3:06:50.800 --> 3:06:54.360]  redundant that I didn't understand why they told me the same thing twice and
[3:06:54.360 --> 3:06:57.920]  there were other things they glossed over I think if you're a fan of Dune you
[3:06:57.920 --> 3:07:01.160]  were excited to watch this amazing cinematography that you know but I was
[3:07:01.160 --> 3:07:09.280]  too confused because it was just like it was very sterile yeah but but but at the
[3:07:09.280 --> 3:07:12.160]  same time if you know the stuff behind it because in the books really good the
[3:07:12.160 --> 3:07:15.880]  one they made in the 80s you know was was was was was well done it had weird
[3:07:15.880 --> 3:07:18.560]  stuff that wasn't part of the book but this is all a metaphor for the real
[3:07:18.560 --> 3:07:23.600]  world I love when I watch films I don't like dialogue I like landscapes and I
[3:07:23.600 --> 3:07:28.040]  like scenes that's what that's what I loved most about it is I don't if I
[3:07:28.040 --> 3:07:33.680]  want dialogue I'm gonna read a book right if I want to watch a film I want an
[3:07:33.680 --> 3:07:37.680]  immersive experience and the way they would do the psychedelic graphics with
[3:07:37.680 --> 3:07:42.160]  the red colored sand breathing over I felt it was an immersive experience the
[3:07:42.160 --> 3:07:46.080]  scene of the where they're sacrificing people and putting blood on the little
[3:07:46.080 --> 3:07:54.200]  soldiers there's all these little cinema cinema the sonography was so good
[3:07:54.200 --> 3:07:59.080]  chanting was so wild the desert scenes and that's what I loved best about it I
[3:07:59.080 --> 3:08:02.160]  wish I'd have seen it in the theater on about you gotta see it in theater yeah I
[3:08:02.160 --> 3:08:06.320]  gotta see it like I want to see it okay it's okay I mean it is a little
[3:08:06.320 --> 3:08:10.520]  cathedral like I felt like I'm in a different universe in the theater I
[3:08:10.520 --> 3:08:14.160]  was and people were falling asleep and people were there was there were very
[3:08:14.160 --> 3:08:18.140]  few people in the theater the ones that were there were like slumped over I was
[3:08:18.140 --> 3:08:22.160]  just sitting there and just thinking to myself like I just feel like nothing is
[3:08:22.160 --> 3:08:27.080]  happening you're so analytical pool is the issue if you the archetypes were
[3:08:27.080 --> 3:08:31.920]  very spiritual and very powerful perhaps yeah yeah yeah you have my only
[3:08:31.920 --> 3:08:35.960]  word I gotta watch in the theater and I want to do it on just a little bit of
[3:08:35.960 --> 3:08:41.200]  little bit of mushrooms just enough I agree I because you wanted to take ayahuasca
[3:08:41.200 --> 3:08:45.440]  we should take mushrooms and go see it yeah we do it today we eat a cap and a
[3:08:45.440 --> 3:08:50.760]  stem and just sit there and let the whole roguerola the whole let's a whole
[3:08:50.760 --> 3:08:56.160]  world no I don't see it see I don't don't do anything I'm just joking as a
[3:08:56.160 --> 3:09:00.080]  family show as if I would ever do no no I mean I do think it's interesting I'm
[3:09:00.080 --> 3:09:06.320]  very like it don't drink don't smoke well taking hallucinogens smoke family
[3:09:06.320 --> 3:09:11.400]  show it's good you did that I drink very very very rarely like once a year twice
[3:09:11.400 --> 3:09:15.840]  a year maybe once you do it for I don't even I don't like the term hallucinogen
[3:09:15.840 --> 3:09:20.200]  or psychedelic I call plant medicine once you do it and you go inward oh my
[3:09:20.200 --> 3:09:24.480]  god the way to do it is you put on an eye mask you take just enough to tip you
[3:09:24.480 --> 3:09:29.240]  over but not so much that you're fully gone and then you'll be surprised at what
[3:09:29.240 --> 3:09:34.080]  kind of trauma you find toxic experiences emotions start to flow up and
[3:09:34.080 --> 3:09:39.120]  then your spiritual channels become more open and you learn about yourself you
[3:09:39.120 --> 3:09:43.360]  cry it's a beautiful experience I I can't recommend it enough if people are
[3:09:43.360 --> 3:09:46.040]  gonna do it the problem is a lot of people like take acid or something in it
[3:09:46.040 --> 3:09:51.480]  you know in their apartment or young or like watching MTV or television you
[3:09:51.480 --> 3:09:54.840]  don't want that's nature it opens you up to God and I'm not saying taking folks
[3:09:54.840 --> 3:09:59.040]  I'm that's why it has a bad reputation is people go oh yeah you know I dropped
[3:09:59.040 --> 3:10:02.800]  acid at a fish concert well that's not what I'm talking about here you're
[3:10:02.800 --> 3:10:08.840]  talking about using medicine which is you read Ezekiel and you read like John
[3:10:08.840 --> 3:10:12.160]  and the ala Patmos and they said the angel came and gave me this and I took
[3:10:12.160 --> 3:10:16.240]  it and it was sweet in my mouth a bitter my stomach and then they I mean it's
[3:10:16.240 --> 3:10:19.800]  it's obvious what's going on here right you're yeah you're blasting off and then
[3:10:19.800 --> 3:10:24.320]  if you do blast off a little bit yeah I definitely want to get you down to Costa
[3:10:24.320 --> 3:10:29.120]  Rica or Peru or to a sanction Native American church just due to the because
[3:10:29.120 --> 3:10:33.480]  I only do it in places where it's you know fully sanctioned because it's a
[3:10:33.480 --> 3:10:37.200]  family show and everything but I think you would be really super especially now
[3:10:37.200 --> 3:10:42.000]  that you've given up alcohol and you've been through so much it would open up but
[3:10:42.000 --> 3:10:46.400]  again that's why I think there's a stigma attached to these compounds because
[3:10:46.400 --> 3:10:51.040]  people act like they're fun if you do plant medicine right it could be the
[3:10:51.040 --> 3:10:55.640]  worst night of your life I guess you're you're you're gonna go to hell in a way
[3:10:55.640 --> 3:10:59.240]  the hell of your own mind you're gonna confront the parts of you that you're
[3:10:59.240 --> 3:11:03.200]  hiding from some people go yeah I did some mushrooms and went to a concert
[3:11:03.200 --> 3:11:07.600]  let's that's all cute and everything but did you go look in yourself and the
[3:11:07.600 --> 3:11:12.480]  darkness within you and confront that shadow that's well that's the one of the
[3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:16.520]  confront the shadow when it takes you over is the problem well it already took
[3:11:16.520 --> 3:11:19.880]  you over cuz it's already there no no I agree I'm just saying you'll be tempted
[3:11:19.880 --> 3:11:22.560]  yeah you'll be tempted you'll go on a full let me say you better if you're
[3:11:22.560 --> 3:11:26.440]  ever doing this folks consult your physician and you definitely need to
[3:11:26.440 --> 3:11:29.360]  not be around very nice people not any type of manipulative people have you
[3:11:29.360 --> 3:11:33.000]  seen fantastic fun guy yet it's a good movie on the trends of this kind explain
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:36.280]  the science because they admit pros and cons of you know on average makes you
[3:11:36.280 --> 3:11:39.480]  kill yourself those are bad drugs but mushrooms with PTSD everything it's
[3:11:39.480 --> 3:11:43.280]  magic they've I mean I wish it's did a gala for a veteran's charity because
[3:11:43.280 --> 3:11:46.560]  everything I advise is legal by the way I don't carry mushrooms in my pocket you're
[3:11:46.560 --> 3:11:51.720]  lawyer yeah so everything that and I'm a target of these forces so I'm super
[3:11:51.720 --> 3:11:56.640]  conscientious on how I conduct myself and I was just at a charity gala for a
[3:11:56.640 --> 3:12:00.000]  veterans group that I helped raise over a hundred thousand dollars for earlier
[3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:04.400]  this year and what they're doing is you're taking guys veterans especially
[3:12:04.400 --> 3:12:08.760]  who have been completely broken through war through trauma a lot of them have
[3:12:08.760 --> 3:12:12.680]  unresolved childhood trauma and they're using MDMA is the one that they're
[3:12:12.680 --> 3:12:15.960]  studying now a big time but they're also using the psilocybin they're also using
[3:12:15.960 --> 3:12:19.640]  ayahuasca and they're having these transformative experiences because what
[3:12:19.640 --> 3:12:23.400]  we're finding with a lot of veterans that I've met and I don't want to breach
[3:12:23.400 --> 3:12:28.520]  anything anyone's told me is the would you say that the hardest men in the world
[3:12:28.520 --> 3:12:34.160]  probably were molested as kids and what we're learning is that that's why you
[3:12:34.160 --> 3:12:39.960]  became hard so you're a kid you get abused you block out that abuse and then
[3:12:39.960 --> 3:12:44.120]  you tell yourself I'm gonna become so strong that that can never happen to me
[3:12:44.120 --> 3:12:48.840]  so the strongest people you see in the world have often suffered the most but
[3:12:48.840 --> 3:12:53.480]  that trauma still remains within I wasn't molested but I got beat up a bunch
[3:12:53.480 --> 3:12:58.640]  but really bad I actually like that I mean I mean I went through a process and
[3:12:58.640 --> 3:13:03.400]  I became more loving afterwards but I actually liked being hardened and that
[3:13:03.400 --> 3:13:08.000]  made me who I am the fact that I don't fear people I can I I like pain I was
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:10.680]  never a masochist but now I mean I can deal with it because I've already been
[3:13:10.680 --> 3:13:14.640]  hurt really bad I actually embraced that I mean but I transcended it's not I don't
[3:13:14.640 --> 3:13:17.760]  want to be in the office of this big powerful killer because I want to be
[3:13:17.760 --> 3:13:20.600]  strong but I'm saying it's an attribute that's there that gives me
[3:13:20.600 --> 3:13:24.160]  understanding well but but that but then at that point in your life you become
[3:13:24.160 --> 3:13:28.240]  strong you still the unresolved trauma is still there and it manifests itself in
[3:13:28.240 --> 3:13:31.440]  various ways so that's where and then now I'm gonna try to stop the globalist
[3:13:31.440 --> 3:13:34.720]  from hurting more people or you or you want to go inward and find the true
[3:13:34.720 --> 3:13:39.000]  powers in your heart and the true power is that realizing that you have that
[3:13:39.000 --> 3:13:43.360]  speed and you have that fortitude but you don't have to live in strength you
[3:13:43.360 --> 3:13:46.720]  can live in a state of love you can live in a state of your heart but you have to
[3:13:46.720 --> 3:13:51.960]  go deep within so these medicines they they take you within and you can't run
[3:13:51.960 --> 3:13:56.640]  I remember I was on one experience and I would open my eyes to try to get away
[3:13:56.640 --> 3:14:00.640]  from what I was seeing inside and the voice was like you can't escape you
[3:14:00.640 --> 3:14:03.680]  can't run from yourself anymore and here's what I'm gonna show you and then
[3:14:03.680 --> 3:14:06.440]  you're like oh my god and there there's all these things that you're
[3:14:06.440 --> 3:14:09.800]  encountering that negative karma that you put in the world the trauma that for
[3:14:09.800 --> 3:14:15.120]  me it's just the universe just opens up and just and just love I don't even but
[3:14:15.120 --> 3:14:19.640]  you have unresolved trauma I don't think yeah what the medicines do is they take
[3:14:19.640 --> 3:14:23.200]  you inside the parts of yourself that may I thought this was done by the way
[3:14:23.200 --> 3:14:27.640]  suggest that on record when people say things oh yeah deals on right I just
[3:14:27.640 --> 3:14:33.320]  thought in my own mind you're just weak because the way that I live my life is
[3:14:33.320 --> 3:14:36.560]  either weak or you're strong and if you're weak you wrote books about that
[3:14:36.560 --> 3:14:39.680]  yeah if you're weak you're pathetic and I don't like you and I want to be around
[3:14:39.680 --> 3:14:43.480]  you because there's a stench and then I realized well that was my own insecurity
[3:14:43.480 --> 3:14:47.160]  right because I in my own mind it said okay there's also the inverse where they
[3:14:47.160 --> 3:14:49.440]  make you a victim you're not saying become a victim you're saying
[3:14:49.440 --> 3:14:52.520]  transcend transcend the victim mode well you become strong and then you turn
[3:14:52.520 --> 3:14:56.720]  inward to find out what drove you through there and then you become connected to
[3:14:56.720 --> 3:15:00.960]  your heart and that connects you to soul into God and then you can become even
[3:15:00.960 --> 3:15:05.120]  stronger by being connected to the infinite right and you open up parts of
[3:15:05.120 --> 3:15:09.040]  yourself that you didn't know you had and that's what the medicines do as they
[3:15:09.040 --> 3:15:12.240]  work on your heart rather than on your mind because neither of you need any
[3:15:12.240 --> 3:15:15.720]  work on your minds right nobody would say all these people aren't intelligent
[3:15:15.720 --> 3:15:20.440]  people but then the question is are you living only in mind or are you living in
[3:15:20.440 --> 3:15:23.720]  a heart also because if you only live in heart you're you're just so I know
[3:15:23.720 --> 3:15:27.800]  hallucinogens and Joe say this made Joe more Joe Rogan more awake you know
[3:15:27.800 --> 3:15:31.800]  person but they just just they're always been really smart but he's be a mean
[3:15:31.800 --> 3:15:35.960]  son of a bitch well that would be part of my 20 some years ago yeah that works
[3:15:35.960 --> 3:15:39.760]  on your heart though which is different so the idea is mind reading study
[3:15:39.760 --> 3:15:43.640]  strength heart is the vulnerable part of yourself the part of yourself that
[3:15:43.640 --> 3:15:47.000]  allows you to get hurt because you're no longer afraid to be hurt you're no
[3:15:47.000 --> 3:15:50.400]  longer afraid to be vulnerable because you know that you can be strong enough
[3:15:50.400 --> 3:15:55.240]  to be vulnerable talk about it when we come right back what if you could cut
[3:15:55.240 --> 3:16:00.320]  your heating it's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that
[3:16:00.320 --> 3:16:05.280]  can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere but if you look at all
[3:16:05.280 --> 3:16:08.080]  the different studies reports about my NASA and other governments other
[3:16:08.080 --> 3:16:12.520]  agencies they all disagree on what's really happening with the client the
[3:16:12.520 --> 3:16:18.280]  only constant the only great truth is change is the only constant so yes
[3:16:18.280 --> 3:16:22.360]  climate change is totally real but notice first they called it global
[3:16:22.360 --> 3:16:25.920]  freezing back in the 70s 80s and then it's gonna be global warming and that
[3:16:25.920 --> 3:16:29.800]  didn't really happen the way they wanted to okay now it's just climate change but
[3:16:29.800 --> 3:16:34.880]  did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the
[3:16:34.880 --> 3:16:39.160]  United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN they
[3:16:39.160 --> 3:16:44.000]  have weather control trees for 1979 and Bill Gates has been manipulating the
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:49.080]  weather for a very long time back in 1994 two scientists won a Nobel Prize for
[3:16:49.080 --> 3:16:52.320]  an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines to control the weather
[3:16:52.320 --> 3:16:59.000]  so yes man-made climate change is real it's time to protect your privacy it's
[3:16:59.000 --> 3:17:02.440]  time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to
[3:17:02.440 --> 3:17:08.720]  hide criminals hackers corporations big tech government are stealing all of your
[3:17:08.720 --> 3:17:13.240]  data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do so in the
[3:17:13.240 --> 3:17:18.400]  future under their globalist takeover they can shut you down protecting your
[3:17:18.400 --> 3:17:22.160]  privacy protecting your credit cards protecting your bank accounts protecting
[3:17:22.160 --> 3:17:26.440]  your photos protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount that's why

[3:17:54.720 --> 3:18:00.040]  the average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware there's
[3:18:00.040 --> 3:18:04.720]  a war between three individuals and nation states on one side and the
[3:18:04.720 --> 3:18:08.840]  globalist on the other who are literally trying to create a post-human world
[3:18:08.840 --> 3:18:12.520]  for the United States of Brazil and of course triggered by the bricks in the
[3:18:12.520 --> 3:18:16.840]  UK nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government
[3:18:16.840 --> 3:18:21.200]  that's why they launched their great reset and their program after collapsing
[3:18:21.200 --> 3:18:27.720]  us of build back better this is nothing more than a top-down vertical
[3:18:27.720 --> 3:18:31.800]  consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take our guns
[3:18:31.800 --> 3:18:36.200]  because we wouldn't bow because the left which is the ideology of this world
[3:18:36.200 --> 3:18:41.560]  government system couldn't win they released a biological weapon on us now
[3:18:41.560 --> 3:18:46.360]  we know two years ago we learned about it about 20 months ago it's that simple
[3:18:46.360 --> 3:18:50.000]  they can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns so the global
[3:18:50.000 --> 3:18:53.960]  corporate compound released COVID-19 and you know the rest of history expose
[3:18:53.960 --> 3:18:56.880]  this paradigm and we win
[3:18:56.880 --> 3:19:03.720]  what our champions made of here's a man who can show you
[3:19:03.720 --> 3:19:12.480]  What's the picture over here?

[3:19:52.720 --> 3:19:56.720]  That's info.com.
[3:19:56.720 --> 3:20:03.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:16.720 --> 3:20:21.720]  Well, we've got Tim Poole and Mike Cernovich in studio with us. I'm Alex Jones.
[3:20:21.720 --> 3:20:27.720]  We're talking about what the globalists of the CIA are obsessed with, you know, literally an MK Ultra kidnapping thousands of children.
[3:20:27.720 --> 3:20:34.720]  This is declassified keeping them for years hooked up to audio and visual sensory things, putting them inside boxes with TV screens all around them,
[3:20:34.720 --> 3:20:41.720]  pumping them full of all sorts of hallucinogens to destroy their underlying human programming and put artificial programming in.
[3:20:41.720 --> 3:20:46.720]  So talking about this is something the enemy's obsessed with. I'm not pushing it. I'm not promoting it.
[3:20:46.720 --> 3:20:53.720]  I'm just saying it's a whole world going on and Big Pharma is now moving in to try to take over this revolution and then, I guess,
[3:20:53.720 --> 3:21:00.720]  genetically engineer the ayahuasca and other things to deploy the molecules they want. They fear these molecules.
[3:21:00.720 --> 3:21:03.720]  You were just saying something about that, Mike Cernovich.
[3:21:03.720 --> 3:21:07.720]  Well, they want to create the technology and take you away from the plants, which is different.
[3:21:07.720 --> 3:21:12.720]  So one reason that plant medicine, and I don't call them hallucinogens and I don't call them psychedelics.
[3:21:12.720 --> 3:21:16.720]  It's like going to a real VR world without the VR.
[3:21:16.720 --> 3:21:25.720]  Yeah, so the reason these plant medicines get a bad reputation is people go, oh, yeah, when I was 18, I dropped acid, went to a concert,
[3:21:25.720 --> 3:21:29.720]  had a bad experience. I know a guy who lost his mind or had psychosis.
[3:21:29.720 --> 3:21:33.720]  And the answer is that if you're under 25, you shouldn't even think about it. That's why they want to do it to their young.
[3:21:33.720 --> 3:21:39.720]  If your brain's not fully developed or you have a history of psychosis, don't even think about this kind of stuff.
[3:21:39.720 --> 3:21:46.720]  That's where the bad reputation comes from. But that's why only the shaman in the old days and every culture, the high priest would do this because they were ready.
[3:21:46.720 --> 3:21:55.720]  You would take people and there's a shamanic practice, a counseling session to it, limited numbers of people, and you take people who have lived a full life,
[3:21:55.720 --> 3:22:02.720]  and then they want to start developing a little bit more spiritual awareness in a way that you can't obtain it otherwise.
[3:22:02.720 --> 3:22:04.720]  I want to see past the veil.
[3:22:04.720 --> 3:22:10.720]  And you want to go into yourself because when I initially was heard about plant medicines and other things,
[3:22:10.720 --> 3:22:18.720]  I was very judgmental of it because the perception is, oh, hey, I'm wearing tie-dye clothes.
[3:22:18.720 --> 3:22:23.720]  I've never done nothing in life. I'm a loser. I do drugs. And yeah, man, I know the real world.
[3:22:23.720 --> 3:22:28.720]  The new people on this world are like losers because they were using it as escapism.
[3:22:28.720 --> 3:22:36.720]  That was my perception of it. And then what I found out was that a lot of people who are not that are very good people,
[3:22:36.720 --> 3:22:42.720]  especially a lot of veterans, have found spiritual healing and emotional healing through these products,
[3:22:42.720 --> 3:22:45.720]  but they don't want to talk about it because it will be dismissed.
[3:22:45.720 --> 3:22:50.720]  So for me, for example, I can say, oh, yeah, here's what I do. What are you going to do?
[3:22:50.720 --> 3:22:56.720]  I'll write another hate article on me. Oh, no, there's going to be another thing calling me a fringe lunatic.
[3:22:56.720 --> 3:23:02.720]  Whatever. I don't care. So I have the freedom. In fact, that's what I was told one time during one of these experiences.
[3:23:02.720 --> 3:23:09.720]  It said, aren't you, and by it, I mean, God, a guide, there's a lot going on there,
[3:23:09.720 --> 3:23:14.720]  but it says, aren't you so blessed that you can talk about whatever you want to talk about?
[3:23:14.720 --> 3:23:18.720]  And they can't shame you. They can't do anything to you.
[3:23:18.720 --> 3:23:24.720]  So a lot of people that you would never have expected to have undergone therapeutic treatment with plant medicines
[3:23:24.720 --> 3:23:28.720]  are there. So then the image is just some loser.
[3:23:28.720 --> 3:23:34.720]  Plant medicines, if it's done right, it's a reset for the brain and helps get rid of some of the programming that's been put in.
[3:23:34.720 --> 3:23:36.720]  You got any comments on this pool?
[3:23:36.720 --> 3:23:39.720]  I am. I have never done any kind of hard drug.
[3:23:39.720 --> 3:23:45.720]  So throughout my whole life, I've had a lot of people tell me, oh, I'd greatly benefit from this, that or otherwise.
[3:23:45.720 --> 3:23:52.720]  But one of the biggest challenges is that it's hard to have someone who I feel is like less put together trying to advise me
[3:23:52.720 --> 3:23:57.720]  on how to do better when, you know, throughout my, I'm younger and I'm starting a business or something.
[3:23:57.720 --> 3:24:00.720]  And then some guy's sleeping on a couch and he's like, yo, you got to do this.
[3:24:00.720 --> 3:24:01.720]  So I've always been...
[3:24:01.720 --> 3:24:03.720]  That's what Mike was saying, kind of that thing.
[3:24:03.720 --> 3:24:05.720]  But I'll tell you this, I've seen the documentaries.
[3:24:05.720 --> 3:24:14.720]  I'm very, very interested in what DMT is all about and extended state DMT experiments and the group experiments.
[3:24:14.720 --> 3:24:21.720]  And I would say in my experience, having met and talked to a lot of people, it feels to me, and I'll be very careful,
[3:24:21.720 --> 3:24:26.720]  because most people would greatly benefit from experiencing mushrooms in particular psilocybin.
[3:24:26.720 --> 3:24:31.720]  And there's also big stores, I think in Silicon Valley, they've been micro dosing LSD as they work,
[3:24:31.720 --> 3:24:36.720]  because it helps them formulate new ideas and be creative and solve problems.
[3:24:36.720 --> 3:24:45.720]  Yeah, there's a lot of people micro-dose psilocybin too, because it takes you off your equilibrium just enough that you see things differently,
[3:24:45.720 --> 3:24:48.720]  but not so much that you're incoherent or buzzed or whatever.
[3:24:48.720 --> 3:24:53.720]  So people would take a small amount and then you go, oh, I didn't realize that this microphone actually looked this way.
[3:24:53.720 --> 3:24:59.720]  You'll notice little details, because you have to, because you're thrown off your game just a little bit.
[3:24:59.720 --> 3:25:00.720]  Let me tell you a story.
[3:25:00.720 --> 3:25:04.720]  And this is something you guys can all do when you're driving down the highway with your friends.
[3:25:04.720 --> 3:25:09.720]  I'm driving down the road on a road trip and I see a cell phone tower.
[3:25:09.720 --> 3:25:15.720]  Now, that's within my perspective, because I was very actively...
[3:25:15.720 --> 3:25:19.720]  We were doing a software company for mobile apps and I needed to understand cell technology and data.
[3:25:19.720 --> 3:25:23.720]  So we're driving on the highway and I see a cell tower and I thought to myself, you know, I never noticed those before.
[3:25:23.720 --> 3:25:24.720]  I never pay attention.
[3:25:24.720 --> 3:25:26.720]  It's never in my field of vision.
[3:25:26.720 --> 3:25:29.720]  So I said to my friend, what do you see right there on the horizon?
[3:25:29.720 --> 3:25:33.720]  There was an open field and one big cell tower coming up and they said, I don't see anything.
[3:25:33.720 --> 3:25:36.720]  I said, right there. It's right there. It's huge. It's sticking right out of the ground.
[3:25:36.720 --> 3:25:38.720]  And they said, I don't know what you're talking about.
[3:25:38.720 --> 3:25:43.720]  They couldn't see the cell phone tower because it wasn't within their mind, their perception.
[3:25:43.720 --> 3:25:46.720]  They just dial it out and we're trying to get everybody to actually see everything.
[3:25:46.720 --> 3:25:50.720]  So did you guys know the story, the old urban legend of the Shaman in Christopher Columbus?
[3:25:50.720 --> 3:25:51.720]  They couldn't see the ship.
[3:25:51.720 --> 3:25:56.720]  They couldn't see the ships because their minds could never conceive of such a thing.
[3:25:56.720 --> 3:26:01.720]  So they could physically see the ship, but when it was on the horizon, their mind ignored it.
[3:26:01.720 --> 3:26:05.720]  And it wasn't until the Shaman who watched the waves, noticed the waves were breaking strangely
[3:26:05.720 --> 3:26:09.720]  and he looked straight up and said, wait a minute, there's something there.
[3:26:09.720 --> 3:26:13.720]  And then he started telling everybody, look right there. Just like, you know, when I tell my friends about a cell tower,
[3:26:13.720 --> 3:26:15.720]  they've never experienced before.
[3:26:15.720 --> 3:26:18.720]  You know, when you look at, particularly in California, they disguise them,
[3:26:18.720 --> 3:26:24.720]  but they're very obvious. It's just a brown metal pole with green antennas and people, they really do this.
[3:26:24.720 --> 3:26:28.720]  And the same thing is true with the oil. The oil that they do in LA, they have big random towers
[3:26:28.720 --> 3:26:31.720]  in like an urban area because they're pumping oil there.
[3:26:31.720 --> 3:26:37.720]  You tell people who don't know this, they just can't understand until you very slowly break it down,
[3:26:37.720 --> 3:26:41.720]  outline it and say, for example, there's a secret nuclear reactor under Austin.
[3:26:41.720 --> 3:26:44.720]  And I learned about it. And it's actually admitted in the literature, it's there.
[3:26:44.720 --> 3:26:48.720]  But you tell Austin, I tell you, you know, there's actually two nuclear reactors in Austin.
[3:26:48.720 --> 3:26:51.720]  They just go, no, there's not because they just can't, they just can't even.
[3:26:51.720 --> 3:26:58.720]  Or just to pick it very banalist, if you get a blue Jeep, you're going to drive, oh, there's Jeeps everywhere.
[3:26:58.720 --> 3:27:01.720]  They were always there, but you weren't focused on it.
[3:27:01.720 --> 3:27:06.720]  So what people do to micro doses, all you're going to do is you're going to notice something that was always there.
[3:27:06.720 --> 3:27:11.720]  But because your mind and the way we filter reality was filtered in a very specific way, you go, oh, wow,
[3:27:11.720 --> 3:27:14.720]  I didn't realize that or the light shines a little bit different.
[3:27:14.720 --> 3:27:19.720]  Or I put these two ideas together, verbal fluency can happen too.
[3:27:19.720 --> 3:27:23.720]  That's why they take those small amounts, which are beneficial.
[3:27:23.720 --> 3:27:27.720]  You know, I think as a lot of people mention, as you get older, time feels shorter, the years get shorter.
[3:27:27.720 --> 3:27:33.720]  I don't, it's obviously not that time is slowing down, but your brain is ignoring the routine.
[3:27:33.720 --> 3:27:36.720]  When you're a little kid, every experience is a new experience.
[3:27:36.720 --> 3:27:39.720]  Every meal is a new meal. Every spice is a new flavor.
[3:27:39.720 --> 3:27:43.720]  But by the time you're in your late 20s, you're in your 30s, how many steaks have you had in your life?
[3:27:43.720 --> 3:27:48.720]  So you wake up in the morning, you get your coffee, you go to work, and your brain says this is not important,
[3:27:48.720 --> 3:27:50.720]  and just glosses over it.
[3:27:50.720 --> 3:27:54.720]  It's not developing the same kind of relationship as it was when you were a kid.
[3:27:54.720 --> 3:27:55.720]  So here's what happens.
[3:27:55.720 --> 3:28:01.720]  If you're 10 years old, in one day you have a thousand experiences.
[3:28:01.720 --> 3:28:04.720]  Your brain is very excitedly looking at each and every experience going,
[3:28:04.720 --> 3:28:06.720]  look at this, look at this, look at this.
[3:28:06.720 --> 3:28:08.720]  Now you're 35, I'm 35.
[3:28:08.720 --> 3:28:12.720]  In one day of a thousand experiences, and my brain goes, done it, done it, done it, done it.
[3:28:12.720 --> 3:28:14.720]  Oh, that's new, done it, done it.
[3:28:14.720 --> 3:28:17.720]  And so at the end of the day, I have a stack of only 10 things to remember.
[3:28:17.720 --> 3:28:21.720]  So it feels like time flew because my brain ignores so much of the routine.
[3:28:21.720 --> 3:28:27.720]  When you do things like micro dosing, your brain starts looking back at everything, and it just brings you back to that space.
[3:28:27.720 --> 3:28:31.720]  Well, there's a reason Tim Poole's exploding and getting so famous, he's super eloquent and smart,
[3:28:31.720 --> 3:28:35.720]  and so's this guy, and I'm in hog heaven.
[3:28:35.720 --> 3:28:38.720]  That was really enlightening right there, and so is what you said.
[3:28:38.720 --> 3:28:40.720]  Oh my gosh, we're going to come right back after this break.
[3:28:40.720 --> 3:28:43.720]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, Mike Cernovich is here.
[3:28:43.720 --> 3:28:46.720]  And of course we have timcast.com, and we have the name of your film.
[3:28:46.720 --> 3:28:47.720]  folksmovie.com.
[3:28:47.720 --> 3:28:48.720]  folksmovie.com.
[3:28:48.720 --> 3:28:51.720]  Let's go back to where you were right there.
[3:28:51.720 --> 3:28:53.720]  That is powerful.
[3:28:53.720 --> 3:28:55.720]  You know, listeners call...
[3:28:55.720 --> 3:29:02.720]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the vaccines are working for, quote,
[3:29:02.720 --> 3:29:10.720]  dark forces that the FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these evil groups are.
[3:29:10.720 --> 3:29:15.720]  They know that all over the world, their poison shot is being banned by major governments.
[3:29:15.720 --> 3:29:17.720]  And Moderna's in trouble as well.
[3:29:17.720 --> 3:29:22.720]  They know that the people are starting to get wise this depopulation agenda.
[3:29:22.720 --> 3:29:27.720]  In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons,
[3:29:27.720 --> 3:29:31.720]  but they're so deadly they're killing a higher percentage up front.
[3:29:31.720 --> 3:29:34.720]  And so people are waking up.
[3:29:34.720 --> 3:29:37.720]  The weapons work a little too good.
[3:29:37.720 --> 3:29:40.720]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars,
[3:29:40.720 --> 3:29:43.720]  but instead they're making too big of a noise.
[3:29:43.720 --> 3:29:45.720]  But it's too late for a return back now.
[3:29:45.720 --> 3:29:47.720]  They're coming after our children.
[3:29:47.720 --> 3:29:52.720]  So it's up to us to protect our little children or God will not look favorably on us.
[3:29:52.720 --> 3:30:21.720]  Remember, God is watching.
[3:30:22.720 --> 3:30:25.720]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates.
[3:30:25.720 --> 3:30:28.720]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[3:30:28.720 --> 3:30:30.720]  You didn't start a fight with the U.N.
[3:30:30.720 --> 3:30:33.720]  They started a fight with you.
[3:30:33.720 --> 3:30:36.720]  And they're not going to back down and they're not going to go away.
[3:30:36.720 --> 3:30:42.720]  They're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of God put into them.
[3:30:42.720 --> 3:30:45.720]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order
[3:30:45.720 --> 3:30:48.720]  or about globalism or about corporate fascism.
[3:30:48.720 --> 3:30:55.720]  It's not until people understand that and that we're under attack that we have any chance of beating these people.
[3:30:55.720 --> 3:31:00.720]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[3:31:00.720 --> 3:31:03.720]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food.
[3:31:03.720 --> 3:31:04.720]  It's all come out.
[3:31:04.720 --> 3:31:06.720]  And they're doing that not because we're weak,
[3:31:06.720 --> 3:31:11.720]  but because we're made the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful.
[3:31:11.720 --> 3:31:14.720]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[3:31:14.720 --> 3:31:19.720]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy.
[3:31:19.720 --> 3:31:21.720]  Is it true?
[3:31:21.720 --> 3:31:27.720]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[3:31:27.720 --> 3:31:32.720]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death
[3:31:32.720 --> 3:31:36.720]  because they know we are strong.
[3:31:36.720 --> 3:31:40.720]  And they know in the end they signed on to God of this world who is a loser.
[3:31:40.720 --> 3:31:44.720]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keeps them full wars in the air now more than ever.
[3:31:44.720 --> 3:31:46.720]  Because even if you don't believe in God,
[3:31:46.720 --> 3:31:50.720]  what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe handling.
[3:31:50.720 --> 3:31:54.720]  And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[3:31:54.720 --> 3:32:01.720]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[3:32:01.720 --> 3:32:07.720]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[3:32:07.720 --> 3:32:12.720]  Horrible crashes and, again, so many toxins on them.
[3:32:12.720 --> 3:32:20.720]  All of the new tropic products that we sell at infowarstore.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality.
[3:32:20.720 --> 3:32:24.720]  And they're long lasting and they help focus your mind.
[3:32:24.720 --> 3:32:28.720]  And right now our strongest product, the three new tropics we have,
[3:32:28.720 --> 3:32:37.720]  Brainforce Plus, Brainforce Ultra and Turboforce are back in stock at infowarstore.com.

[3:33:47.720 --> 3:33:52.720]  So resetwars.com, we got Mike Sternovich and of course we got Tim Pool here.
[3:33:52.720 --> 3:33:55.720]  Tim, what you were hitting is the best I've ever heard it described though.
[3:33:55.720 --> 3:34:01.720]  And then once we went to break you, we're going further about your, you know, you've been visiting here awesome for a few days.
[3:34:01.720 --> 3:34:06.720]  Seems like a hundred years. You really articulated why people get Alzheimer's, all of this.
[3:34:06.720 --> 3:34:11.720]  This is one of the secrets to consciousness you're talking about and longevity of the mind.
[3:34:11.720 --> 3:34:13.720]  Living, you know, experiencing life.
[3:34:13.720 --> 3:34:17.720]  So what I was saying, we were in that last segment, we went to the break.
[3:34:17.720 --> 3:34:21.720]  I've been here in Austin since I believe we came in here on Saturday.
[3:34:21.720 --> 3:34:26.720]  And I, after I finished my morning show, I was talking to my girlfriend and I was just like, is it, it's only Thursday?
[3:34:26.720 --> 3:34:28.720]  I feel like we've been here for weeks.
[3:34:28.720 --> 3:34:32.720]  And it's because the experience here, you know, we got an RV, mobile studio.
[3:34:32.720 --> 3:34:37.720]  We're meeting people and doing shows we've never done before, eating food in places we've never done before.
[3:34:37.720 --> 3:34:41.720]  So each and every experience is new and my brain is very attentive to it.
[3:34:41.720 --> 3:34:43.720]  I'm like, where am I? What is this? What is that?
[3:34:43.720 --> 3:34:47.720]  But I could remember every single detail from the moment I got here.
[3:34:47.720 --> 3:34:50.720]  I couldn't tell you what happened two weeks ago because it's at my house. I've been at my house for years.
[3:34:50.720 --> 3:34:53.720]  I wake up, I do my job, I work from home and go to bed.
[3:34:53.720 --> 3:34:57.720]  And I'm just thinking to myself that routine my brain doesn't care about.
[3:34:57.720 --> 3:35:01.720]  It's like, Tim, you've woken up in this bed a thousand times.
[3:35:01.720 --> 3:35:03.720]  It is not relevant to your memory or your character.
[3:35:03.720 --> 3:35:07.720]  But waking up in Austin in a mobile studio is new and exciting.
[3:35:07.720 --> 3:35:11.720]  And my brain has to write this down and be like, we need to understand this new experience.
[3:35:11.720 --> 3:35:17.720]  So it makes time feel longer, makes it feel like the days have become longer instead of shorter.
[3:35:17.720 --> 3:35:21.720]  So that's something I try to think about too, making sure you don't fall too much into routine.
[3:35:21.720 --> 3:35:24.720]  As you get older, you always try to explore new things, read new books, watch new shows.
[3:35:24.720 --> 3:35:29.720]  Well, that's what kills you. I mean, they know that for 30 years, TV causes Alzheimer's.
[3:35:29.720 --> 3:35:33.720]  Non-active TV. TV is like a book with text and go here, do that.
[3:35:33.720 --> 3:35:37.720]  That can actually help your mind. Listen to radio. You have to image what they're saying.
[3:35:37.720 --> 3:35:40.720]  That makes your brain more complex, more connections.
[3:35:40.720 --> 3:35:45.720]  But then when you just start not having the neurons fire and then you basically die.
[3:35:45.720 --> 3:35:49.720]  Yeah, there was a character in Catch 22 who he wanted to live longer.
[3:35:49.720 --> 3:35:54.720]  So everything he did was boring because when you're boring, boring time stretches out.
[3:35:54.720 --> 3:35:57.720]  And that was his whole schtick was, I want to feel like life is slowing down.
[3:35:57.720 --> 3:35:59.720]  So everything I'm going to do is being boring.
[3:35:59.720 --> 3:36:05.720]  Or there's, if you're doing cardio and you think time flies too fast, hop on an exercise bike and pedal as fast as you can.
[3:36:05.720 --> 3:36:08.720]  And you can have some very long minutes in there.
[3:36:08.720 --> 3:36:11.720]  And that's what was the one way that I've kind of counteracted.
[3:36:11.720 --> 3:36:17.720]  That is I began a gratitude practice every night where I think about everything happened at the day.
[3:36:17.720 --> 3:36:24.720]  And then I realized, wow, you really, if you're hitting it, you, what you do is you go A to B, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:36:24.720 --> 3:36:27.720]  And then you feel like you didn't do anything, especially if you're a driven person.
[3:36:27.720 --> 3:36:30.720]  That's a paradox of successful people.
[3:36:30.720 --> 3:36:39.720]  The paradox of successful people is you're driven to do a lot due to some kind of internal structure and security, whatever the case might be.
[3:36:39.720 --> 3:36:44.720]  And you accomplish so much that by the time you go to bed, you think, what do I even do today?
[3:36:44.720 --> 3:36:45.720]  I just totally wasted my day.
[3:36:45.720 --> 3:36:47.720]  What a loser you are, you know?
[3:36:47.720 --> 3:36:49.720]  And then I started to think, no, no, here's what I did.
[3:36:49.720 --> 3:36:50.720]  Here's what I woke up.
[3:36:50.720 --> 3:36:55.720]  And then I think for the blessings or the challenges of the day, and you realize you live a full day.
[3:36:55.720 --> 3:36:58.720]  So gratitude practice is very helpful and helpful.
[3:36:58.720 --> 3:37:04.720]  My father always said to me, the key to really being a real human is being grateful.
[3:37:04.720 --> 3:37:08.720]  Yeah, it makes you realize that you do, you do a lot in a day.
[3:37:08.720 --> 3:37:11.720]  And especially again, the harder the charger you are.
[3:37:11.720 --> 3:37:17.720]  That's what I've learned older in life is people make all these assumptions about successful people and they write books.
[3:37:17.720 --> 3:37:19.720]  Here's a successful person.
[3:37:19.720 --> 3:37:27.720]  Realizing a lot of people became successful due to something internally that maybe isn't that pleasant.
[3:37:27.720 --> 3:37:29.720]  Maybe you feel like I don't want to be a loser.
[3:37:29.720 --> 3:37:36.720]  So you're driven to be successful because you're running away from loser energy, which is in a way making you positive.
[3:37:36.720 --> 3:37:40.720]  You're making a positive out of a negative, but the negative charge of that energy is still there.
[3:37:40.720 --> 3:37:46.720]  But then you go so fast through the experience that you feel like you didn't do anything.
[3:37:46.720 --> 3:37:51.720]  No, I totally agree with you, but my enemies messing with me makes me fight harder.
[3:37:51.720 --> 3:37:56.720]  And so I am turning a negative into a positive and I think that's overall good, but you're right.
[3:37:56.720 --> 3:38:03.720]  If it makes you work too hard and you kill yourself or kind of run over some people in the process, then it's not good.
[3:38:03.720 --> 3:38:05.720]  But duty is also a motivator.
[3:38:05.720 --> 3:38:09.720]  You know, I'm hearing what you're saying and I'm thinking about, you know, what's my motivation to wake up?
[3:38:09.720 --> 3:38:11.720]  You know, I do a morning show and a night show.
[3:38:11.720 --> 3:38:13.720]  It's like just work, work, work, work, work.
[3:38:13.720 --> 3:38:15.720]  And it feels more like duty.
[3:38:15.720 --> 3:38:20.720]  You know, I'd love to just make a bunch of money and then drive off to the, to, you know, go to the mountains
[3:38:20.720 --> 3:38:23.720]  and just get a dog and a satellite dish, play video games all day.
[3:38:23.720 --> 3:38:27.720]  But as much as that's relaxing and might feel good, it doesn't actually feel good to me.
[3:38:27.720 --> 3:38:29.720]  I look at everything that's going on in the world.
[3:38:29.720 --> 3:38:31.720]  No, you're right. It feels good for a little while, then it feels horrible.
[3:38:31.720 --> 3:38:35.720]  It feels, so whenever I have a day off when, you know, I got sick recently and I'm sitting there,
[3:38:35.720 --> 3:38:37.720]  I was binging HouseMD, good show.
[3:38:37.720 --> 3:38:41.720]  And I was just like, I hate this because I feel like I have a duty.
[3:38:41.720 --> 3:38:43.720]  It's not anger. It's not insecurity.
[3:38:43.720 --> 3:38:47.720]  It's not slavery. It's a program of destiny.
[3:38:47.720 --> 3:38:49.720]  Duty is destiny. Destiny is duty.
[3:38:49.720 --> 3:38:53.720]  Because I have a duty to take on these globalists.
[3:38:53.720 --> 3:38:56.720]  And I knew it like before I even got on air.
[3:38:56.720 --> 3:38:58.720]  You're addicted. You're driven. You can't. You have to do it.
[3:38:58.720 --> 3:38:59.720]  You know what I mean?
[3:38:59.720 --> 3:39:00.720]  It's a fire.
[3:39:00.720 --> 3:39:01.720]  Right, right, right.
[3:39:01.720 --> 3:39:07.720]  I wake up and, you know, I read the news and I wonder how this story is so fake.
[3:39:07.720 --> 3:39:10.720]  I need to tell people, make sure they understand they're being tricked.
[3:39:10.720 --> 3:39:13.720]  I need to help them get past these.
[3:39:13.720 --> 3:39:16.720]  Exactly. And then the globalists, they love to lie.
[3:39:16.720 --> 3:39:19.720]  Like they're pushed to lie, whereas I don't like that's a lie.
[3:39:19.720 --> 3:39:20.720]  I got to show them that's a lie.
[3:39:20.720 --> 3:39:22.720]  So what is that?
[3:39:22.720 --> 3:39:25.720]  Well, that's, again, each person's individual journey.
[3:39:25.720 --> 3:39:28.720]  And it's a beautiful thing that a negative can become a positive.
[3:39:28.720 --> 3:39:32.720]  But then on the other hand, you don't want to end up as an 80-year-old person who,
[3:39:32.720 --> 3:39:34.720]  even though you've lived an adventurous life,
[3:39:34.720 --> 3:39:36.720]  have you had enough love in your life?
[3:39:36.720 --> 3:39:38.720]  That's what I think about more and more as I get older
[3:39:38.720 --> 3:39:41.720]  and where daughters have really opened up my heart in a lot of ways,
[3:39:41.720 --> 3:39:43.720]  which is, do I have enough love in my life?
[3:39:43.720 --> 3:39:44.720]  I have enough success.
[3:39:44.720 --> 3:39:47.720]  Like, I don't do, people are like, why don't you, what's your next thing?
[3:39:47.720 --> 3:39:48.720]  What's this and that?
[3:39:48.720 --> 3:39:52.720]  My next thing is opening my heart more to love and to spirituality
[3:39:52.720 --> 3:39:55.720]  and to a connection with God and a connection to the next generation.
[3:39:55.720 --> 3:39:57.720]  Well, you remember the movie with Viggo Mortensen on the road
[3:39:57.720 --> 3:40:01.720]  when he's there with Robert DeVall and he goes, this child, your son's a God.
[3:40:01.720 --> 3:40:03.720]  In this whole evil world, he's the God.
[3:40:03.720 --> 3:40:04.720]  He can be the whole future.
[3:40:04.720 --> 3:40:07.720]  And I look at my son's great, you know, he's 19 and I love him.
[3:40:07.720 --> 3:40:09.720]  But with my daughters, I got three of them and it's like,
[3:40:09.720 --> 3:40:11.720]  I look at my four-year-old and it's like, that's God right there.
[3:40:11.720 --> 3:40:14.720]  I mean, that is a goddess.
[3:40:14.720 --> 3:40:16.720]  That is like literally everything.
[3:40:16.720 --> 3:40:21.720]  Have you guys read that it's a famous trope or quote?
[3:40:21.720 --> 3:40:24.720]  No one on their deathbed ever said I should have worked more.
[3:40:24.720 --> 3:40:28.720]  There's a meme that goes around where it says they wrote down,
[3:40:28.720 --> 3:40:30.720]  you know, everybody they saw passing in the hospital
[3:40:30.720 --> 3:40:32.720]  and they always said, I wish I spent more time with my family.
[3:40:32.720 --> 3:40:34.720]  I wish I was there for my kids more.
[3:40:34.720 --> 3:40:36.720]  I wish I worked less.
[3:40:36.720 --> 3:40:38.720]  I wish I had more love, things like that.
[3:40:38.720 --> 3:40:42.720]  I think that may be the most dire warning for every single person
[3:40:42.720 --> 3:40:46.720]  to consider that family is everything, you know.
[3:40:46.720 --> 3:40:48.720]  That's why it's under attack.
[3:40:48.720 --> 3:40:52.720]  And that's why I do fear projects because I got on that grind
[3:40:52.720 --> 3:40:54.720]  and it's a rewarding grind.
[3:40:54.720 --> 3:40:56.720]  You get psychological rewards, emotional rewards,
[3:40:56.720 --> 3:40:59.720]  spiritual rewards, often financial rewards.
[3:40:59.720 --> 3:41:01.720]  So I can definitely, whatever happens,
[3:41:01.720 --> 3:41:03.720]  because every day, you know, our lives are in danger
[3:41:03.720 --> 3:41:06.720]  due to these evil forces in this world.
[3:41:06.720 --> 3:41:10.720]  There's like no question that I've put my daughters first.
[3:41:10.720 --> 3:41:13.720]  And that's a lot of that too is the plant medicine
[3:41:13.720 --> 3:41:16.720]  showed me that kind of energy where, you know,
[3:41:16.720 --> 3:41:18.720]  what are you driven by?
[3:41:18.720 --> 3:41:20.720]  What do you think you value?
[3:41:20.720 --> 3:41:23.720]  But then it'll take you an experience and show you what you value.
[3:41:23.720 --> 3:41:24.720]  So here's what I mean.
[3:41:24.720 --> 3:41:26.720]  If I get a room of guys who are successful
[3:41:26.720 --> 3:41:28.720]  and they all have families and I say, what do you value most?
[3:41:28.720 --> 3:41:31.720]  They're all going to say, well, I value my children.
[3:41:31.720 --> 3:41:33.720]  I value my wife.
[3:41:33.720 --> 3:41:35.720]  I value my church.
[3:41:35.720 --> 3:41:38.720]  And then you say, okay, I want to audit your time.
[3:41:38.720 --> 3:41:41.720]  How much time are you spending on your children?
[3:41:41.720 --> 3:41:43.720]  How much time are you spending on your wife?
[3:41:43.720 --> 3:41:45.720]  How much time are you spending on your church?
[3:41:45.720 --> 3:41:46.720]  Complete disconnect.
[3:41:46.720 --> 3:41:49.720]  But I think the argument is I've got to do this to defend them
[3:41:49.720 --> 3:41:51.720]  because I've actually very clear cut.
[3:41:51.720 --> 3:41:53.720]  I've got to fight this globalist operation
[3:41:53.720 --> 3:41:56.720]  or literally they're going to come forcibly inject my children.
[3:41:56.720 --> 3:41:58.720]  So I believe me, I want to spend time with them
[3:41:58.720 --> 3:41:59.720]  and I want to be there.
[3:41:59.720 --> 3:42:01.720]  But I've got to do this.
[3:42:01.720 --> 3:42:04.720]  But that's again, that's the burden you bear.
[3:42:04.720 --> 3:42:08.720]  But on the flip side is it doesn't mean it's wrong to work a lot
[3:42:08.720 --> 3:42:11.720]  because I grew up poor and I had a great balance.
[3:42:11.720 --> 3:42:12.720]  Everything's about us.
[3:42:12.720 --> 3:42:14.720]  Yeah, I grew up poor and I wish I had more money as a kid
[3:42:14.720 --> 3:42:16.720]  because we had some real bad poverty that doesn't.
[3:42:16.720 --> 3:42:19.720]  There's this myth that growing up poor makes those character.
[3:42:19.720 --> 3:42:20.720]  And no, you get lucky.
[3:42:20.720 --> 3:42:23.720]  So people who grew up poor, get lucky, get out.
[3:42:23.720 --> 3:42:27.720]  And then this whole Horatio Alger mythology that I want my kids
[3:42:27.720 --> 3:42:30.720]  to grow up poor because I grew up poor and now I'm not.
[3:42:30.720 --> 3:42:33.720]  No, I see what happens on the average to people.
[3:42:33.720 --> 3:42:36.720]  So obviously you want to walk between both worlds,
[3:42:36.720 --> 3:42:39.720]  but that is an indictment on how people should spend their time.
[3:42:39.720 --> 3:42:41.720]  But you just, you think about it and you realize,
[3:42:41.720 --> 3:42:43.720]  yeah, like what have I done with my daughters?
[3:42:43.720 --> 3:42:47.720]  Okay, Tucker, did you just say today we played, I read five books.
[3:42:47.720 --> 3:42:49.720]  My kids know that I work a lot.
[3:42:49.720 --> 3:42:50.720]  No, you're right.
[3:42:50.720 --> 3:42:52.720]  We have to invest in our children when we're done.
[3:42:52.720 --> 3:42:53.720]  Stay there, we'll be right back.
[3:42:53.720 --> 3:42:55.720]  It's time to show them.
[3:42:55.720 --> 3:42:59.720]  So many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks,
[3:42:59.720 --> 3:43:01.720]  energy powders, energy pills.
[3:43:01.720 --> 3:43:05.720]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic
[3:43:05.720 --> 3:43:08.720]  and they've got incredible downsides, horrible crashes,
[3:43:08.720 --> 3:43:12.720]  and again, so many toxins on them.
[3:43:12.720 --> 3:43:17.720]  All of the Neutropic products that we sell at mfoldwarstore.com
[3:43:17.720 --> 3:43:20.720]  are clean, are pure, are highest quality,
[3:43:20.720 --> 3:43:24.720]  and they're long lasting and they help focus your mind.
[3:43:24.720 --> 3:43:28.720]  And right now our strongest product, the three Neutrobics we have,
[3:43:28.720 --> 3:43:31.720]  Rainforce Plus, Rainforce Ultra,
[3:43:31.720 --> 3:43:37.720]  and Turboforce are back in stock at mfoldwarstore.com.
[3:43:37.720 --> 3:43:41.720]  Turboforce has been sold out for more than six months.
[3:43:41.720 --> 3:43:44.720]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.

[3:43:58.720 --> 3:44:00.720]  Granny do right, Granny do right.
[3:44:00.720 --> 3:44:02.720]  Thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[3:44:02.720 --> 3:44:05.720]  Challenge first of all, let me say I love your products.
[3:44:05.720 --> 3:44:09.720]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there
[3:44:09.720 --> 3:44:11.720]  that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[3:44:11.720 --> 3:44:15.720]  I was loaded up with sunspots or H-spots as they're lovingly called.
[3:44:15.720 --> 3:44:19.720]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years,
[3:44:19.720 --> 3:44:22.720]  my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[3:44:22.720 --> 3:44:24.720]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[3:44:24.720 --> 3:44:27.720]  And I was already taking your other supplements,
[3:44:27.720 --> 3:44:30.720]  but I thought, you know, well maybe that's what I need to do
[3:44:30.720 --> 3:44:33.720]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[3:44:33.720 --> 3:44:36.720]  But when I started taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately,
[3:44:36.720 --> 3:44:39.720]  but you know, over a period of time I started noticing,
[3:44:39.720 --> 3:44:43.720]  okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful,
[3:44:43.720 --> 3:44:48.720]  you know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[3:44:48.720 --> 3:44:53.720]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[3:44:54.720 --> 3:45:02.720]  Info wars, get prepared, mega blowout sale 2021 is live right now.

[3:45:57.720 --> 3:46:02.720]  If you only knew the power of the dark side,
[3:46:02.720 --> 3:46:09.720]  join Bill Gates, and together we will defeat humanity.
[3:46:09.720 --> 3:46:15.720]  Then our gods will reward us with eternal life.
[3:46:15.720 --> 3:46:20.720]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[3:46:20.720 --> 3:46:23.720]  They must first play God, they must first prove
[3:46:23.720 --> 3:46:28.720]  that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system.
[3:46:28.720 --> 3:46:31.720]  And in a way they're right, if we let them lie to us
[3:46:31.720 --> 3:46:35.720]  and dumb us down and poison us and destroy our children's futures,
[3:46:35.720 --> 3:46:37.720]  and the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open,
[3:46:37.720 --> 3:46:40.720]  we really deserve what's happened to us.
[3:46:40.720 --> 3:46:45.720]  So I ask you now, are you going to step up and expose
[3:46:45.720 --> 3:46:47.720]  the dual order even more?
[3:46:47.720 --> 3:46:50.720]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[3:46:50.720 --> 3:47:18.720]  The front lines of the fight is infowars.com.
[3:47:18.720 --> 3:47:20.720]  I just asked Mike Cernovich to come back on tomorrow
[3:47:20.720 --> 3:47:22.720]  and he said yes, Tim Pool though, I don't know,
[3:47:22.720 --> 3:47:24.720]  he's probably too cool for us.
[3:47:24.720 --> 3:47:26.720]  My brain is melting from the amount of work we've been doing.
[3:47:26.720 --> 3:47:29.720]  You know, we had nine people on the show on Tuesday.
[3:47:29.720 --> 3:47:31.720]  And you've never been more alive.
[3:47:31.720 --> 3:47:33.720]  I know, that's absolutely true.
[3:47:33.720 --> 3:47:36.720]  But I'm going to need to sleep for a whole day once we're back.
[3:47:36.720 --> 3:47:37.720]  Absolutely, process it all.
[3:47:37.720 --> 3:47:40.720]  Okay, listen, I don't give friends guns that I don't care about.
[3:47:40.720 --> 3:47:44.720]  I had my favorite rifle, a 300 win mag,
[3:47:44.720 --> 3:47:48.720]  a semi-automatic, highest rated gun, at 500 yards,
[3:47:48.720 --> 3:47:50.720]  I was shooting patterns like this big, okay?
[3:47:50.720 --> 3:47:52.720]  You couldn't even get it anymore now.
[3:47:52.720 --> 3:47:54.720]  I gave it to Joe Rogan.
[3:47:54.720 --> 3:47:56.720]  He was in the studio a year ago.
[3:47:56.720 --> 3:47:58.720]  He was in the studio with you, just a few days ago with us.
[3:47:58.720 --> 3:48:01.720]  This is the best shooting, it's a larger handgun.
[3:48:01.720 --> 3:48:03.720]  I've got a small one that's also awesome.
[3:48:03.720 --> 3:48:05.720]  Made in Texas, made up in Georgetown, North Austin.
[3:48:05.720 --> 3:48:08.720]  It's an STI 2011, that's not the year,
[3:48:08.720 --> 3:48:11.720]  it's what's called 2011 Marauder.
[3:48:11.720 --> 3:48:13.720]  Made in Georgetown, Texas.
[3:48:13.720 --> 3:48:14.720]  Here it is, my friend.
[3:48:14.720 --> 3:48:17.720]  It is unloaded, and obviously we're going to send it to your FFL
[3:48:17.720 --> 3:48:20.720]  up in West Virginia, so it's all legally done.
[3:48:20.720 --> 3:48:24.720]  But here is your new handgun.
[3:48:24.720 --> 3:48:26.720]  Maybe we can do a Doc McHenry shot of this for TV viewers.
[3:48:26.720 --> 3:48:28.720]  Yeah, let's get the overhead shot on that.
[3:48:28.720 --> 3:48:30.720]  That is scoochy.
[3:48:30.720 --> 3:48:35.720]  Let me tell you, I mean, I can shoot like two inch groups
[3:48:35.720 --> 3:48:37.720]  at 100 yards with this.
[3:48:37.720 --> 3:48:38.720]  Hold on there, Alex.
[3:48:38.720 --> 3:48:40.720]  Let's not be ADA binger.
[3:48:40.720 --> 3:48:43.720]  Make sure you check it.
[3:48:43.720 --> 3:48:44.720]  I didn't open it.
[3:48:44.720 --> 3:48:45.720]  I didn't open it.
[3:48:45.720 --> 3:48:47.720]  I'm just saying, we don't want to be an Alec Baldwin here.
[3:48:47.720 --> 3:48:49.720]  No, that's why I didn't even touch that.
[3:48:49.720 --> 3:48:51.720]  That's a beautiful gun.
[3:48:51.720 --> 3:48:54.720]  No, that's why we're going to go shatter the shooting.
[3:48:54.720 --> 3:48:56.720]  We've got a lot of security guys when we're really safe,
[3:48:56.720 --> 3:48:58.720]  because that's the deal.
[3:48:58.720 --> 3:49:03.720]  But here, this is not the super gun safety guy myself,
[3:49:03.720 --> 3:49:07.720]  but the point is, there it is, my friend.
[3:49:07.720 --> 3:49:10.720]  We've got a couple extra magazines for you, too.
[3:49:10.720 --> 3:49:12.720]  That's a bad-ass gun.
[3:49:12.720 --> 3:49:13.720]  Yeah, it is.
[3:49:13.720 --> 3:49:15.720]  I mean, hands down, these are the best guns.
[3:49:15.720 --> 3:49:16.720]  Very nice.
[3:49:16.720 --> 3:49:17.720]  Was nine?
[3:49:17.720 --> 3:49:20.720]  Yeah, we'll go out there and we'll shoot like with glocks
[3:49:20.720 --> 3:49:21.720]  at 100 yards.
[3:49:21.720 --> 3:49:23.720]  You can't hit the three inch target.
[3:49:23.720 --> 3:49:25.720]  With these, bing, bing, bing, bing, 100 yards, man.
[3:49:25.720 --> 3:49:26.720]  It's unbelievable.
[3:49:26.720 --> 3:49:29.720]  I am far from a gun expert, but I've recently started
[3:49:29.720 --> 3:49:34.720]  acquiring more and more as I think they're important to have.
[3:49:34.720 --> 3:49:36.720]  I think it's important to exercise your rights.
[3:49:36.720 --> 3:49:37.720]  Exercise.
[3:49:37.720 --> 3:49:38.720]  You lose it.
[3:49:38.720 --> 3:49:39.720]  You know, in atrophies.
[3:49:39.720 --> 3:49:40.720]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[3:49:40.720 --> 3:49:42.720]  By the way, my other one's at home.
[3:49:42.720 --> 3:49:44.720]  My black one's the same model.
[3:49:44.720 --> 3:49:46.720]  It's Cernovich's, so we're going to get that.
[3:49:46.720 --> 3:49:47.720]  Get that transferred.
[3:49:47.720 --> 3:49:49.720]  But you live in California, so I may not be able to see.
[3:49:49.720 --> 3:49:50.720]  I can't get it.
[3:49:50.720 --> 3:49:52.720]  Yeah, I just have to cover it from here.
[3:49:52.720 --> 3:49:54.720]  So, California, you can't have anything good.
[3:49:54.720 --> 3:49:56.720]  Why don't we get you to move to Texas?
[3:49:56.720 --> 3:49:59.720]  If I move, I'll move into the boonies, man.
[3:49:59.720 --> 3:50:01.720]  I'm moving to the boonies.
[3:50:01.720 --> 3:50:02.720]  Montana?
[3:50:02.720 --> 3:50:03.720]  I'm moving to the boonies.
[3:50:03.720 --> 3:50:04.720]  Wyoming sounds so good.
[3:50:04.720 --> 3:50:05.720]  Oh, yeah, it does.
[3:50:05.720 --> 3:50:06.720]  It sounds like paradise.
[3:50:06.720 --> 3:50:07.720]  Montana, man.
[3:50:07.720 --> 3:50:09.720]  I'm moving to the land of the Tatas.
[3:50:09.720 --> 3:50:12.720]  Yeah, I moved to a state named after women's breath.
[3:50:12.720 --> 3:50:14.720]  I love that, and I worship that.
[3:50:14.720 --> 3:50:15.720]  I drove through Wyoming.
[3:50:15.720 --> 3:50:17.720]  There's limited cell service.
[3:50:17.720 --> 3:50:19.720]  Struggled to find a gas station.
[3:50:19.720 --> 3:50:20.720]  Oh, it was beautiful.
[3:50:20.720 --> 3:50:23.720]  You know the guy I want, maybe they can find it, is the,
[3:50:23.720 --> 3:50:26.720]  or rather, they can find it on the video, is,
[3:50:26.720 --> 3:50:29.720]  the SIGSAR has a new bolt action rifle that breaks down
[3:50:29.720 --> 3:50:30.720]  that you can carry.
[3:50:30.720 --> 3:50:31.720]  I have that gun.
[3:50:31.720 --> 3:50:32.720]  Oh, my God.
[3:50:32.720 --> 3:50:33.720]  We've got to shoot that.
[3:50:33.720 --> 3:50:34.720]  We'll be shooting it Saturday.
[3:50:34.720 --> 3:50:35.720]  Okay, we've got to take that off.
[3:50:35.720 --> 3:50:36.720]  Can I give you, you want me to give you that one?
[3:50:36.720 --> 3:50:37.720]  Yes.
[3:50:37.720 --> 3:50:38.720]  All right.
[3:50:38.720 --> 3:50:39.720]  Yeah, that is, yeah, it's, it's badass.
[3:50:39.720 --> 3:50:40.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[3:50:40.720 --> 3:50:41.720]  It said that's the one to be adjustable.
[3:50:41.720 --> 3:50:42.720]  Hey, we haven't aired this yet.
[3:50:42.720 --> 3:50:43.720]  Go ask Rob, dude.
[3:50:43.720 --> 3:50:44.720]  He's got the video.
[3:50:44.720 --> 3:50:45.720]  We haven't aired it for me shooting that.
[3:50:45.720 --> 3:50:46.720]  Badass gun.
[3:50:46.720 --> 3:50:47.720]  Oh, my God.
[3:50:47.720 --> 3:50:48.720]  Beautiful, yeah.
[3:50:48.720 --> 3:50:49.720]  It's all yours, bounty hunter.
[3:50:49.720 --> 3:50:50.720]  We'll send it to the, you know, you've got to see the Legion.
[3:50:50.720 --> 3:50:51.720]  Absolutely.
[3:50:51.720 --> 3:50:52.720]  I'm just saying you'll hand it over.
[3:50:52.720 --> 3:50:53.720]  There you go.
[3:50:53.720 --> 3:50:54.720]  Do you have a SIG P320, the Legion?
[3:50:54.720 --> 3:50:55.720]  That's what I got right there.
[3:50:55.720 --> 3:50:56.720]  Whoa.
[3:50:56.720 --> 3:50:57.720]  Yeah, that's the one.
[3:50:57.720 --> 3:51:04.720]  It's from, oh my God, it's very light, we got two of them.
[3:51:04.720 --> 3:51:05.720]  Yeah.
[3:51:05.720 --> 3:51:06.720]  Definitely want to take that out.
[3:51:06.720 --> 3:51:07.720]  We got a few guns.
[3:51:07.720 --> 3:51:08.720]  What do you, what do you have a chambered in?
[3:51:08.720 --> 3:51:09.720]  It's the Creedmoor.
[3:51:09.720 --> 3:51:10.720]  Oh, wow.
[3:51:10.720 --> 3:51:11.720]  Good.
[3:51:11.720 --> 3:51:12.720]  I'm going to have fun with that one.
[3:51:12.720 --> 3:51:14.720]  Well, this is, this is the deep and hard of Texas.
[3:51:14.720 --> 3:51:15.720]  We got guns.
[3:51:15.720 --> 3:51:16.720]  Yeah.
[3:51:16.720 --> 3:51:18.720]  Well, constitutional carry here is new.
[3:51:18.720 --> 3:51:19.720]  Yeah.
[3:51:19.720 --> 3:51:20.720]  It's, it's, it's wild.
[3:51:20.720 --> 3:51:21.720]  No surprise to me.
[3:51:21.720 --> 3:51:22.720]  I've got my concealed carry cart.
[3:51:22.720 --> 3:51:23.720]  I'm like, why don't I even have this?
[3:51:23.720 --> 3:51:24.720]  Yeah.
[3:51:24.720 --> 3:51:27.320]  Well, even when I grew up, I grew up in a blue state, but it was still because it was
[3:51:27.320 --> 3:51:28.320]  rural guns.
[3:51:28.320 --> 3:51:32.320]  So you had all the, you could have almost anything, had a lot of fun, but then yeah,
[3:51:32.320 --> 3:51:34.120]  California is super strict.
[3:51:34.120 --> 3:51:39.320]  I think the, the most recent gun you can have is a Gen 3 Glock 19.
[3:51:39.320 --> 3:51:41.880]  Then the first of the gun dealers are all jerks down there too.
[3:51:41.880 --> 3:51:45.040]  I was, I've, I've tweeted about that before actually.
[3:51:45.040 --> 3:51:49.820]  If you, if anybody's watching and you own a gun shop and you're jerks to your customers,
[3:51:49.820 --> 3:51:53.120]  which is a lot of people who work at gun shops, you're not that cool.
[3:51:53.120 --> 3:51:54.120]  My God.
[3:51:54.120 --> 3:51:55.120]  You're not that cool.
[3:51:55.120 --> 3:51:57.480]  They act like liberal, liberal waiters.
[3:51:57.480 --> 3:51:58.480]  Yeah, you know, yeah.
[3:51:58.480 --> 3:52:01.200]  And they act like you're imposing the jerks.
[3:52:01.200 --> 3:52:02.200]  It blows me away.
[3:52:02.200 --> 3:52:03.200]  It's not a gun shop.
[3:52:03.200 --> 3:52:04.200]  It's like, come to the gun shop.
[3:52:04.200 --> 3:52:05.200]  We love you.
[3:52:05.200 --> 3:52:06.200]  I went to one.
[3:52:06.200 --> 3:52:09.920]  I was with a, a guys had five deployments and the gun shop owner talked to us like we
[3:52:09.920 --> 3:52:13.960]  were children and it's like, what have you even done in your life?
[3:52:13.960 --> 3:52:15.360]  First of all, why are you this condescending?
[3:52:15.360 --> 3:52:16.360]  They need that.
[3:52:16.360 --> 3:52:17.360]  You don't even know who you're talking to.
[3:52:17.360 --> 3:52:18.360]  You're dorks.
[3:52:18.360 --> 3:52:19.360]  Yeah.
[3:52:19.360 --> 3:52:20.360]  I've, I've not experienced that.
[3:52:20.360 --> 3:52:21.360]  I've had really, really good experiences.
[3:52:21.360 --> 3:52:24.760]  Um, I will say though, you mentioned, you know, where you grew up, I grew up in Chicago
[3:52:24.760 --> 3:52:28.040]  where obviously only criminals are allowed to have guns, you know, well, they're not
[3:52:28.040 --> 3:52:31.480]  allowed to, but the only ones who are capable because they do it.
[3:52:31.480 --> 3:52:32.480]  Yeah.
[3:52:32.480 --> 3:52:33.480]  Yeah.
[3:52:33.480 --> 3:52:34.480]  Law abiding citizens.
[3:52:34.480 --> 3:52:35.480]  Good luck getting a gun in Illinois.
[3:52:35.480 --> 3:52:36.480]  I mean, you can get long guns, but it's difficult.
[3:52:36.480 --> 3:52:37.480]  You can.
[3:52:37.480 --> 3:52:38.480]  It's just.
[3:52:38.480 --> 3:52:39.480]  Outside of there.
[3:52:39.480 --> 3:52:40.480]  Yeah.
[3:52:40.480 --> 3:52:41.480]  I lived in the rural parts.
[3:52:41.480 --> 3:52:42.480]  So we had, this is during the assault weapons man.
[3:52:42.480 --> 3:52:43.480]  We had Mac 90s.
[3:52:43.480 --> 3:52:46.680]  You couldn't get them with the pistol grip, but you could get the, oh, I love my Mac 90.
[3:52:46.680 --> 3:52:47.680]  Yeah.
[3:52:47.680 --> 3:52:48.680]  Yeah.
[3:52:48.680 --> 3:52:49.680]  See, yeah.
[3:52:49.680 --> 3:52:50.680]  200 bucks to the gun show.
[3:52:50.680 --> 3:52:51.680]  Chinese AK 47.
[3:52:51.680 --> 3:52:52.680]  Yeah.
[3:52:52.680 --> 3:52:53.680]  So we have a Hungarian.
[3:52:53.680 --> 3:52:54.680]  We have one from every country.
[3:52:54.680 --> 3:52:56.440]  We have a Russian, a Hungarian and a Chinese one.
[3:52:56.440 --> 3:52:57.440]  Yeah.
[3:52:57.440 --> 3:52:58.960]  Then you had the mill stock versus a stamp, stamp stock.
[3:52:58.960 --> 3:52:59.960]  Yeah.
[3:52:59.960 --> 3:53:02.000]  I got a sick P two to six for my graduation present.
[3:53:02.000 --> 3:53:03.600]  So we're found the stamp one.
[3:53:03.600 --> 3:53:04.600]  Shoot.
[3:53:04.600 --> 3:53:05.600]  This is good as a mill.
[3:53:05.600 --> 3:53:07.320]  They do, but the milled one is because it's so cheap.
[3:53:07.320 --> 3:53:11.080]  You would have a bunch that we, you would have 10 Mac 90s and think, well, I want one
[3:53:11.080 --> 3:53:14.000]  from, we have an Egyptian mill stock.
[3:53:14.000 --> 3:53:16.200]  So where the, the steel almost looks like Damascus.
[3:53:16.200 --> 3:53:18.560]  It has the, the waves in it.
[3:53:18.560 --> 3:53:21.160]  I have all those, but I can't have anything in California.
[3:53:21.160 --> 3:53:24.280]  That's all, you know, with my grandpa at his house.
[3:53:24.280 --> 3:53:28.000]  I miss, you know, the AK 47 is a nice, good, good simple rifle.
[3:53:28.000 --> 3:53:29.000]  Yeah.
[3:53:29.000 --> 3:53:31.200]  They, they shoot a direct blowback.
[3:53:31.200 --> 3:53:32.200]  They're fun.
[3:53:32.200 --> 3:53:35.600]  You know, obviously because of the long banana style clip, that's great.
[3:53:35.600 --> 3:53:38.880]  There's inferior processes to it, but we had all those.
[3:53:38.880 --> 3:53:39.880]  Yeah.
[3:53:39.880 --> 3:53:44.160]  You can, you can have guns that look real in California, but the magazine is that removable.
[3:53:44.160 --> 3:53:46.000]  It's not even, not even a point to have.
[3:53:46.000 --> 3:53:47.000]  Yeah.
[3:53:47.000 --> 3:53:48.000]  Collision and cough.
[3:53:48.000 --> 3:53:49.000]  Sorry.
[3:53:49.000 --> 3:53:53.160]  I accidentally ordered a large case of Makarov nine millimeter because I had no idea and
[3:53:53.160 --> 3:53:54.160]  those, I don't know.
[3:53:54.160 --> 3:53:55.160]  It's basically a Soviet bullet.
[3:53:55.160 --> 3:53:56.960]  It doesn't work in a standard nine millimeter Luger.
[3:53:56.960 --> 3:54:00.440]  And so the guys contacted me from the ammo company and they were like, did you make a
[3:54:00.440 --> 3:54:01.440]  mistake on this one?
[3:54:01.440 --> 3:54:03.040]  Cause then I was like, I did, but I want them.
[3:54:03.040 --> 3:54:08.520]  So I ended up getting some cold war era Polish handguns, which those are fun.
[3:54:08.520 --> 3:54:09.520]  I think they're called P 64s.
[3:54:09.520 --> 3:54:10.520]  I'm not sure.
[3:54:10.520 --> 3:54:12.280]  Stars or the right handed only.
[3:54:12.280 --> 3:54:13.280]  They have an ergonomic thing.
[3:54:13.280 --> 3:54:14.760]  It doesn't really go in your left hand.
[3:54:14.760 --> 3:54:15.760]  I got one of those.
[3:54:15.760 --> 3:54:16.760]  But you know what I'm looking for now.
[3:54:16.760 --> 3:54:21.800]  I was talking to someone about maybe we can get them, get one, get a, a, a Makarov carbine
[3:54:21.800 --> 3:54:26.240]  made so that I have something for the range where we can use these, these Makarov bullets.
[3:54:26.240 --> 3:54:30.720]  Well, let me tell you, I'm not the super guns, gun guy, like, like a military guy that knows
[3:54:30.720 --> 3:54:35.080]  all the children armor, but you're going to shoot some guns Saturday.
[3:54:35.080 --> 3:54:36.080]  We got some guns.
[3:54:36.080 --> 3:54:37.080]  We got a lot of guns.
[3:54:37.080 --> 3:54:38.080]  You got some Barrett.
[3:54:38.080 --> 3:54:39.080]  I made twos.
[3:54:39.080 --> 3:54:40.080]  We got Barrett's.
[3:54:40.080 --> 3:54:41.080]  We got, we got Lapua's.
[3:54:41.080 --> 3:54:42.080]  We got everything.
[3:54:42.080 --> 3:54:43.080]  You have a CZ 57.
[3:54:43.080 --> 3:54:44.200]  That's the only gun to have a shot.
[3:54:44.200 --> 3:54:50.200]  I want to shoot the CZ 57 with the weird bullet, the weird, um, those are really little bit
[3:54:50.200 --> 3:54:51.200]  of guns.
[3:54:51.200 --> 3:54:54.760]  That's the only, the only, the only law enforcement you know, a CZ 57.
[3:54:54.760 --> 3:54:58.320]  They're the ones where the, the bullet is a different kind of shell casing.
[3:54:58.320 --> 3:54:59.680]  They come out extra fast.
[3:54:59.680 --> 3:55:00.680]  Those are super tiny.
[3:55:00.680 --> 3:55:01.680]  Tiny, tiny.
[3:55:01.680 --> 3:55:03.180]  You got any P 90s?
[3:55:03.180 --> 3:55:05.200]  We got a lot of guns.
[3:55:05.200 --> 3:55:11.760]  We got, uh, I mean, we P 90 has the top loading, uh, magazine where they, they, they go in
[3:55:11.760 --> 3:55:15.000]  and they spin as they come down into the, into the chamber.
[3:55:15.000 --> 3:55:17.760]  Are you talking about bullpup rifle or pistol?
[3:55:17.760 --> 3:55:20.040]  Uh, no, no, no, P 90s.
[3:55:20.040 --> 3:55:21.840]  It's, it's, you, you load the mag on top.
[3:55:21.840 --> 3:55:22.840]  Oh, okay.
[3:55:22.840 --> 3:55:23.840]  Yeah.
[3:55:23.840 --> 3:55:24.840]  Fold it in.
[3:55:24.840 --> 3:55:25.840]  Yeah.
[3:55:25.840 --> 3:55:26.840]  I really want to try one of those.
[3:55:26.840 --> 3:55:27.840]  Is that a saw?
[3:55:27.840 --> 3:55:28.840]  I don't know.
[3:55:28.840 --> 3:55:29.840]  I think it's called P 90s.
[3:55:29.840 --> 3:55:30.840]  We'll see what you got.
[3:55:30.840 --> 3:55:31.840]  Yeah.
[3:55:31.840 --> 3:55:32.840]  We got a bullpup.
[3:55:32.840 --> 3:55:33.840]  We got a lot of guns.
[3:55:33.840 --> 3:55:34.840]  All right.
[3:55:34.840 --> 3:55:35.840]  Bullpup shotguns.
[3:55:35.840 --> 3:55:36.840]  We got a little too many.
[3:55:36.840 --> 3:55:37.840]  It's like smog sits on piles of gold.
[3:55:37.840 --> 3:55:38.840]  I sit on piles of guns.
[3:55:38.840 --> 3:55:43.120]  No, no, no, you, Sean, when my wife came to meet my dad for the first time, she sees
[3:55:43.120 --> 3:55:44.120]  all this stuff.
[3:55:44.120 --> 3:55:45.120]  She's like, Oh my God.
[3:55:45.120 --> 3:55:46.120]  This is so weird.
[3:55:46.120 --> 3:55:49.640]  And I thought this is kind of ordinary around a wheel of, like you only have five
[3:55:49.640 --> 3:55:50.640]  Mac nineties.
[3:55:50.640 --> 3:55:51.640]  How can you only have five?
[3:55:51.640 --> 3:55:52.640]  They're only $300 guns.
[3:55:52.640 --> 3:55:56.320]  So I don't know what they cost now, but yeah, they were only $300 guns.
[3:55:56.320 --> 3:56:02.080]  So you'd go the gun show and get your Mac 90 and then you'd collect the different countries,
[3:56:02.080 --> 3:56:03.080]  collect the different Mac nineties.
[3:56:03.080 --> 3:56:04.080]  The Chinese one.
[3:56:04.080 --> 3:56:05.080]  Yeah.
[3:56:05.080 --> 3:56:07.600]  Well, it was M a K cause you couldn't have an eight seven.
[3:56:07.600 --> 3:56:13.080]  So everybody called it Mac 90, but the Romanian would still be called a Mac 90, even though
[3:56:13.080 --> 3:56:14.920]  it wasn't Chinese made.
[3:56:14.920 --> 3:56:15.920]  All right.
[3:56:15.920 --> 3:56:19.680]  Oh, and Troyer takes over with the war room in about three minutes.
[3:56:19.680 --> 3:56:21.080]  We're going to break a minute and a half.
[3:56:21.080 --> 3:56:23.000]  Guys, thank you for coming on.

[3:56:27.280 --> 3:56:30.640]  Yeah, every generation has its struggles.
[3:56:30.640 --> 3:56:35.560]  I think life in the United States is better than it's ever been, but they're very evil
[3:56:35.560 --> 3:56:38.000]  elements that are trying to constantly subvert that.
[3:56:38.000 --> 3:56:42.480]  So there is a constant battle between two great dragons or two wolves or have you want to

[3:57:47.560 --> 3:57:50.960]  in modern medicine introducing pollen block.
[3:57:50.960 --> 3:57:56.200]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[3:57:56.200 --> 3:58:03.160]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[3:58:03.160 --> 3:58:09.120]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[3:58:09.120 --> 3:58:12.480]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[3:58:12.480 --> 3:58:17.480]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit
[3:58:17.480 --> 3:58:22.600]  of this research, a fast acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[3:58:22.600 --> 3:58:26.200]  symptoms pollen because natural and effective.
[3:58:26.200 --> 3:58:27.200]  It is not an antihistamine.
[3:58:27.200 --> 3:58:32.200]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[3:58:32.200 --> 3:58:37.680]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[3:58:37.680 --> 3:58:43.240]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe, head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of
[3:58:43.240 --> 3:58:46.600]  our pollen block chewable tablets.
[3:58:46.600 --> 3:58:50.480]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul.
[3:58:50.480 --> 3:58:56.040]  I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet, I've had a lot of loss that everybody else
[3:58:56.040 --> 3:58:57.040]  has.
[3:58:57.040 --> 3:59:06.760]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died
[3:59:06.760 --> 3:59:10.480]  and bled and sweat for.
[3:59:10.480 --> 3:59:12.760]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[3:59:12.760 --> 3:59:18.720]  And I see the general public, ENA, medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral,
[3:59:18.720 --> 3:59:21.720]  psychologically controlled, tranty.
[3:59:21.720 --> 3:59:27.320]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder and it's so incredibly sad.
[3:59:27.320 --> 3:59:34.480]  But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating
[3:59:34.480 --> 3:59:38.080]  and collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[3:59:38.080 --> 3:59:42.400]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence
[3:59:42.400 --> 3:59:48.320]  and collapse to actually end the species as we know.
[3:59:48.320 --> 4:00:05.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
