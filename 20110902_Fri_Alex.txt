[00:42.680 --> 00:48.120]  last night a lot of reports key information covered and the feedback
[00:48.120 --> 00:53.640]  we've gotten from the viewers at prisonplanet.tv and of course InfoWarsNews.com
[00:53.640 --> 00:59.480]  has been overwhelmingly positive I'd say about 99% we are gonna be

[01:10.280 --> 01:16.160]  we're also going to start restreaming it over and over again after the
[01:16.160 --> 01:22.160]  transmission is completed and people certainly like that we had close to half
[01:22.160 --> 01:27.840]  of our prisonplanet.tv members tune in last night to the show so I appreciate
[01:27.840 --> 01:31.320]  everybody watching it hopefully you recorded it and we'll get it out to
[01:31.320 --> 01:41.480]  others okay wow reading the news this morning listening to the president they
[01:41.480 --> 01:44.800]  really are planning to implode the economy they've been imploding it but
[01:44.800 --> 01:49.800]  it's going to accelerate and now internal mega bank documents have come out and
[01:49.800 --> 01:54.120]  only confirm what we already know about JP Morgan Goldman Sachs and others they
[01:54.120 --> 01:57.600]  have been engineering this thing all along not just here but all over the
[01:57.600 --> 02:02.440]  world and they're telling insiders to bet against the economy and to bet on a
[02:02.440 --> 02:07.920]  total collapse well of course and then they'll pose the savers again and play
[02:07.920 --> 02:15.760]  stupid and have their bottom paid for presidents in the US in Greece the
[02:15.760 --> 02:19.400]  prime minister in England the president of France the president of Germany the
[02:19.400 --> 02:23.040]  chancellor have a president and chancellor they're all bought and paid
[02:23.040 --> 02:28.400]  for by these people and we're going to be going over that stack of just
[02:28.400 --> 02:34.520]  incredibly important news now there's been an interim victory because Obama
[02:34.520 --> 02:39.320]  got caught giving waivers only the general electric and by caught we pointed
[02:39.320 --> 02:44.040]  it out others pointed it out he did it in plain view it's an unfair trade
[02:44.040 --> 02:48.120]  advantage it's discrimination against other companies they're backing off for
[02:48.120 --> 02:55.480]  now on part of their carbon dioxide regulations they call carbon dioxide
[02:55.480 --> 03:02.680]  smog we have some of the cleanest power plants in the country here in the United
[03:02.680 --> 03:07.840]  States from the cleanest power plants in the world and I'm not saying coal is
[03:07.840 --> 03:13.800]  perfect gasoline certainly is a dirty fuel all of it petrochemicals but it's
[03:13.800 --> 03:18.320]  what we've got and we're going into a depression that's been engineered we
[03:18.320 --> 03:23.000]  can't let these people slap carbon taxes and value-added taxes on us for
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.320]  austerity to pay into their 1.5 quadrillion black hole we cannot do
[03:28.320 --> 03:33.560]  it the system that claims that they're all environmentalist and doing all this
[03:33.560 --> 03:36.760]  for the earth it's the opposite they've been suppressing many of the clean
[03:36.760 --> 03:42.160]  technologies the environmental movement at the top is there to control the
[03:42.160 --> 03:46.400]  movement and distract people off into issues like carbon dioxide while
[03:46.400 --> 03:52.480]  covering up the toxic waste dumping the toxins in the plastics the toxins
[03:52.480 --> 03:56.880]  they're adding to the water and all of that is dwarfed by genetic engineering
[03:56.880 --> 04:00.680]  I just do more and more research and they're just admitting that there are
[04:00.680 --> 04:08.320]  thousands of companies splicing animal plant plant insect insect reptile human
[04:08.320 --> 04:14.600]  bovine it is just so insane and it's already giving rise to all sorts of
[04:14.600 --> 04:23.240]  different insane mutations a decade ago 99% of all corn varieties in Mexico the
[04:23.240 --> 04:29.040]  where we're cultivated corn originated under human cultivation tens of
[04:29.040 --> 04:33.600]  thousands of years ago has all been wrecked they've got all this deformed
[04:33.600 --> 04:39.160]  corn growing it's making people sick and they've banned it down there I mean we
[04:39.160 --> 04:44.400]  are in the middle of a of a holocaust of global issue genics as they
[04:44.400 --> 04:51.040]  devilishly absolutely wreck the ecosystem and butcher the very building
[04:51.040 --> 04:55.320]  blocks of this planet all the news is coming up Larry Pratt judges on the
[04:55.320 --> 05:04.040]  ATF oh it's big stay with us hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the
[05:04.040 --> 05:09.040]  last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're
[05:09.040 --> 05:12.840]  finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[05:12.840 --> 05:17.000]  Americans at home I've turned menace influence on our president in
[05:17.000 --> 05:21.840]  Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all
[05:21.840 --> 05:26.840]  of us as American citizens to pay attention fall of the Republic identifies
[05:26.840 --> 05:31.920]  the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying
[05:31.920 --> 05:35.920]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner
[05:35.920 --> 05:39.880]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[05:39.880 --> 05:43.920]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and

[07:03.400 --> 07:07.360]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[07:07.360 --> 07:11.640]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[07:11.640 --> 07:15.880]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[07:15.880 --> 07:20.240]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[07:20.240 --> 07:24.360]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[07:24.360 --> 07:28.920]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:28.920 --> 07:33.000]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:33.000 --> 07:37.000]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.800]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[07:40.800 --> 07:43.520]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[07:43.520 --> 07:48.480]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at WWW dot my
[07:48.480 --> 07:52.600]  solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government
[07:52.600 --> 08:00.680]  doesn't own the Sun so go to my solar backup dot com or call 1-877-327-0365
[08:00.680 --> 08:27.480]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:27.480 --> 08:35.600]  we've been reporting on fast and furious for six years that's right before we knew
[08:35.600 --> 08:41.160]  the name of the secret federal program to train who lost Zettis at Fort Benning
[08:41.160 --> 08:46.860]  Georgia then have them engage in a fake defection forming their own border drug
[08:46.860 --> 08:54.320]  cartel Selle Castile and many other sources here in Texas Selle Castile
[08:54.320 --> 09:01.040]  of course retired DEA agent had said that a coming war over narcotics and the
[09:01.040 --> 09:07.320]  500 billion coming in a year most of it through Mexico heroin and cocaine that
[09:07.320 --> 09:12.280]  there would be a war over that 500 billion dollars in that well just three
[09:12.280 --> 09:18.120]  years ago that Los Zettis had tried to recruit him to train people near the King
[09:18.120 --> 09:27.400]  Ranch down by Kingsville Texas and now it's all happened and at first ATFA just
[09:27.400 --> 09:30.440]  began to blow the whistle about the fact that they were basically ordering
[09:30.440 --> 09:37.680]  gunshots to let certain key people come in and buy masses of firearms to then
[09:37.680 --> 09:41.960]  take them into Mexico now we've learned and this has come out in federal court
[09:41.960 --> 09:47.120]  in Chicago it's been reported on by the Chicago Tribune and the El Paso times
[09:47.120 --> 09:51.200]  of course Paul Watson saw it in the federal record months ago before they
[09:51.200 --> 09:57.120]  even covered it proud of our work at presentplanet.com and infowars.com now
[09:57.120 --> 10:03.040]  it has come out that indeed they were shipping the guns directly to the drug
[10:03.040 --> 10:11.320]  cartels not just in Mexico but in Miami Florida Chicago Illinois Los Angeles
[10:11.320 --> 10:16.760]  California and other cities and how did all this happen the rats began to bite
[10:16.760 --> 10:22.640]  at each other the head of the ATF what three months ago was caught perjuring
[10:22.640 --> 10:28.520]  himself before Congress and ATF agents who he was hanging out to dry released
[10:28.520 --> 10:35.440]  the orders the documents the memos and the emails ordering them to do this he
[10:35.440 --> 10:41.720]  was trying to deny it then he came out and said okay I was ordered to by Eric
[10:41.720 --> 10:46.880]  Holder the head of the Justice Department the Attorney General and then he
[10:46.880 --> 10:53.240]  said here's more documents don't blame me the FBI and DEA were involved well
[10:53.240 --> 11:03.080]  now that's all mainstream news DEA FBI ATF shipping guns to Honduras to Mexico
[11:03.080 --> 11:11.600]  and to drug gangs in major cities major distribution points Chicago Miami
[11:11.600 --> 11:18.880]  Los Angeles and now it's coming out that the same thing was going on in areas of
[11:18.880 --> 11:25.400]  New Mexico Texas we're learning more every day what a window into the fact
[11:25.400 --> 11:31.160]  that this federal government is gangster at the top and has put its
[11:31.160 --> 11:35.400]  gangsters in most of the high-level and mid-level positions and are now trying
[11:35.400 --> 11:41.680]  to purge good people now it gives me some faith in America that we can still
[11:41.680 --> 11:47.240]  turn this around that it was ATF agents five of them some of them mid-level
[11:47.240 --> 11:51.360]  senior in their area that said we're not going to be part of this and leaked the
[11:51.360 --> 11:57.480]  information that went public they were either fired or demoted and of course it
[11:57.480 --> 12:02.840]  came out two weeks ago as the Attorney General tries to cover this up that the
[12:02.840 --> 12:08.800]  supervisors that blocked the information and threatened reprisals they of
[12:08.800 --> 12:15.040]  course the LA Times reported have now been given raises and elevated to the
[12:15.040 --> 12:25.400]  national level with Kush desk jobs now so this is a criminal mafia that a wanted
[12:25.400 --> 12:32.680]  to get guns to cartels trained by the Pentagon to consolidate the flow of
[12:32.680 --> 12:37.800]  drugs into the United States through Mexico and also out of Central and
[12:37.800 --> 12:41.680]  South America we now learn that's mainstream news a month ago came out
[12:41.680 --> 12:49.360]  now continuing domestically it had the added goodie of blaming the Second
[12:49.360 --> 12:53.520]  Amendment and I saw a holder two years ago saying we've got to pass gun laws
[12:53.520 --> 12:57.040]  we've got a ban assault weapons we've got a restrict you're buying more than one
[12:57.040 --> 13:01.800]  gun because of the violence in Mexico and then even after he got caught he
[13:01.800 --> 13:05.320]  rolled out as you know about a month and a half ago and went ahead and said I
[13:05.320 --> 13:09.000]  don't need a stinking law Congress wouldn't pass this law they tried to
[13:09.000 --> 13:17.160]  pass it so now in four states Texas to Mexico Arizona California wait is Nevada
[13:17.160 --> 13:27.600]  involved is it five what's four in those four states they now outside of law do
[13:27.600 --> 13:36.120]  whatever the ATF says and they're going to people that go in and buy a high
[13:36.120 --> 13:40.560]  powered rifle or buy a thousand rounds of ammo I see it in the news every day
[13:40.560 --> 13:45.720]  that they're then being ATF visited or even SWAT team and I'll see it in the
[13:45.720 --> 13:51.800]  news man had 27 guns and 4,000 rounds of ammo and they'll have neighbors saying
[13:51.800 --> 13:56.820]  it's so frightening and it's you know they're retired veteran has been
[13:56.820 --> 14:00.200]  arrested in fact I was mailed one of these do pointed it out to me this
[14:00.200 --> 14:05.640]  morning the Orleans County record out of Massachusetts right up there on our
[14:05.640 --> 14:12.040]  northern border and it says firearms seized and it says ATF take guns from
[14:12.040 --> 14:17.640]  former police officer who has no criminal record retired he ran for sheriff
[14:17.640 --> 14:23.920]  almost one but didn't want mr. Keate and he's been a gun dealer for many years
[14:23.920 --> 14:28.120]  that's why he quit being a cop so he can make money and shell guns he's a
[14:28.120 --> 14:32.560]  registered federal firearms dealer and they say right here they confiscated
[14:32.560 --> 14:37.280]  his firearms and they say there's no charges and that they're just taking
[14:37.280 --> 14:41.640]  them and that's the end of it so we're gonna work on getting him on it says
[14:41.640 --> 14:45.960]  above Sergeant David Peterson a member of the Vermont State Police bomb squad

[17:05.680 --> 17:11.480]  been all over the news and they'll just lop it off this is what America is okay

[24:22.000 --> 24:25.120]  information then we're gonna go to your calls I'd love to hear from you
[24:25.120 --> 24:36.120]  800-259-9231 800-259-9231 by the way last night's kickoff was very very
[24:36.120 --> 24:40.440]  successful the first news program ended up being an hour long I told you it'll
[24:40.440 --> 24:44.800]  always be 30 minutes at least but that's the great part about when we're first
[24:44.800 --> 24:50.280]  kicking this off ahead of cable systems and others picking it up is that I can
[24:50.280 --> 24:56.000]  make it as long as I want and this is really the beta testing phase but also a
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.600]  lot of times we'll have the 30-minute show and then we'll just come back and
[24:58.600 --> 25:02.800]  continue with a special report sometimes I'll say okay I'm interviewing four
[25:02.800 --> 25:07.400]  guests and taking your phone calls after the news and that's what I did
[25:07.400 --> 25:10.880]  basically last night as I talked for about 40 minutes before he kicked the
[25:10.880 --> 25:14.800]  news off and it was a little bit silly and made fun of teleprompters because we
[25:14.800 --> 25:18.320]  are teleprompter free and the crew did a really great job I didn't get out of
[25:18.320 --> 25:23.800]  here till about 11 o'clock last night and I went on coast to coast a.m. to talk
[25:23.800 --> 25:31.040]  with the one the only icon of the talk radio overnight George Norrie okay again
[25:31.040 --> 25:37.960]  new information on the bass inferior situation it's not new information it
[25:37.960 --> 25:47.080]  has been in regional papers in Illinois in Texas in Florida that they're shipping
[25:47.080 --> 25:51.600]  the guns directly to drug gangs in the cities inside the U.S. and we've hosted
[25:51.600 --> 25:57.560]  those articles we've written articles about it but Fox News is finally starting
[25:57.560 --> 26:03.520]  to look at it and they say evidence suggest cover-up in ATF scandal as more
[26:03.520 --> 26:08.120]  guns appear at crime scene that's like saying evidence suggest Hitler didn't
[26:08.120 --> 26:14.040]  like Jews or evidence suggest that Santa Claus is associated with Coca-Cola or
[26:14.040 --> 26:22.160]  evidence suggest that they use a pig skin and NFL football I mean I evidence
[26:22.160 --> 26:25.680]  suggests that Barack Obama reads off teleprompters evidence suggests that
[26:25.680 --> 26:30.000]  grass is green the sky is blue and water is wet and ducks quack they are
[26:30.000 --> 26:34.120]  completely caught from every angle perjuring themselves they've had
[26:34.120 --> 26:38.800]  testimony in Congress that yes the Obama administration did know members of
[26:38.800 --> 26:42.160]  the ATF called people in the administration high-level the names are
[26:42.160 --> 26:45.080]  all public and so this is really dangerous we should stop it as the
[26:45.080 --> 26:49.200]  president know they're told yes continue this is all come out what do you mean
[26:49.200 --> 26:54.440]  evidence suggest see Fox News doesn't really want to get Obama and stop this
[26:54.440 --> 26:59.520]  agenda they've given tons of money to Hillary and Obama and the rest of it
[26:59.520 --> 27:03.400]  they want to just act like they represent conservatives and libertarians
[27:03.400 --> 27:06.880]  and they're the alternative to singing in and the rest of it and they are they
[27:06.880 --> 27:09.960]  are the alternative it's like Jim Jones saying you can have grape strawberry
[27:09.960 --> 27:14.160]  cherry you know three different choices here or American who different
[27:14.160 --> 27:18.360]  choices of Kool-Aid but it's all gonna have a teaspoon of cyanide enough to
[27:18.360 --> 27:24.280]  kill you know ten elephants so how's that sound I mean Ripper Murdock admits
[27:24.280 --> 27:29.520]  that they finance and push the carbon tax I've played their corporate PR clips
[27:29.520 --> 27:34.120]  where they brag that they're implanting messages in their TV shows but see Fox is
[27:34.120 --> 27:37.760]  there to keep their friends close globalist and keep their enemies
[27:37.760 --> 27:43.640]  Americans that are a late closer and I'm only pointing out that CNN won't cover
[27:43.640 --> 27:47.360]  this and strangely enough CBS is one of the only groups has actually been
[27:47.360 --> 27:51.680]  covering it and still whitewashing but they you know broke it in the quote
[27:51.680 --> 27:57.200]  national media the mainstream the corporate media but and I'm not even
[27:57.200 --> 28:02.520]  trying to attack Fox here it's just that if the quote mainstream media came out
[28:02.520 --> 28:06.440]  and pointed out the perjury and where's the impeachment where's the hearings it
[28:06.440 --> 28:10.360]  would be over they don't want that they want Obama the puppet to be politically
[28:10.360 --> 28:17.320]  destroyed move on and they're gonna give you Mitt Romney or Rick Perry both for
[28:17.320 --> 28:21.720]  socialist health care on record both for carbon taxes on record both for
[28:21.720 --> 28:28.160]  sanctuary cities on record I guess Romney didn't work for Al Gore
[28:28.160 --> 28:34.040]  Bilderberg I mean it just I mean you it couldn't be crazier but see as soon as
[28:34.040 --> 28:37.320]  they put a Mitt Romney in conservatives main linemans will sit back and go
[28:37.320 --> 28:41.280]  ahead and carbon tax me go ahead and take my guns because they'll have mainline
[28:41.280 --> 28:46.760]  liberals attacking Romney or Perry and then conservatives main linemans aren't
[28:46.760 --> 28:52.080]  sophisticated enough to get the scam and go wait a minute you're attacking him
[28:52.080 --> 28:54.840]  to make them look like they have credibility because they know that
[28:54.840 --> 28:58.120]  conservatives are going to hate Rachel Maddow more than they are going to
[28:58.120 --> 29:02.600]  dislike the socialism and the consolidation of power and the cronyism of
[29:02.600 --> 29:11.280]  Rick Perry me it's such elementary tricks when Fox News attacks Obama liberals
[29:11.280 --> 29:16.560]  then support him as he carries out a globalist agenda it's such a simple
[29:16.560 --> 29:23.920]  simple simple trick that a five-year-old should be able to understand it it's
[29:23.920 --> 29:29.320]  asinine how simple it is here's Fox News evidence suggests cover-up in ATF
[29:29.320 --> 29:34.920]  scandal really as more guns appear at crime scenes oh the numbers higher than
[29:34.920 --> 29:38.440]  what they said yeah the number we've got 30,000 at least just hours after the
[29:38.440 --> 29:42.000]  death of board patrol agent Brian Terry federal officials tried to cover up
[29:42.000 --> 29:45.120]  evidence of the gun that killed Terry was one that the government initially
[29:45.120 --> 29:50.280]  helped sell the Mexican cartels in a weapons trafficking program we're on

[33:27.240 --> 33:32.120]  down the details of the latest ATF activities also all over the country
[33:32.120 --> 33:38.720]  the ATF local police are rating gun dealers gun collectors gun owners and
[33:38.720 --> 33:42.760]  almost all cases are law-abiding citizens if you buy even a 500 rounds of ammo
[33:42.760 --> 33:48.680]  now in many cases you're getting a ATF visit and sometimes they just come and
[33:48.680 --> 33:52.480]  confiscate everything just like Katrina hey I'm high and dry here I've got a
[33:52.480 --> 33:56.480]  generator why are you here we're gonna put you in handcuffs and cut your gun

[34:04.560 --> 34:11.000]  them they are all about flaunting this in their face yeah I saw a Chicago Tribune
[34:11.000 --> 34:15.320]  article this morning and somewhere here in my stack of these type Alex Jones
[34:15.320 --> 34:20.480]  Ron Paul into Google News it'll come up and it's like Ron Paul can't be president
[34:20.480 --> 34:26.080]  because once he was on the Alex Jones show in 2005 during Katrina and Jones
[34:26.080 --> 34:30.200]  was talking about Mexican and Dutch troops being brought in as part of the
[34:30.200 --> 34:35.080]  relief effort which they were and this was part of a conditioning process for
[34:35.080 --> 34:39.120]  foreign occupation and Ron Paul agreed that it was a dangerous precedent
[34:39.120 --> 34:43.920]  here's a link to it this is insane oh really on Monday it was in major
[34:43.920 --> 34:48.760]  newspapers including what the New York Times that oh Mexican Army now comes up
[34:48.760 --> 34:53.720]  to 20 miles into the US and interdicts drugs without even asking the US they've
[34:53.720 --> 34:56.840]  been authorized to come in with commando raids and they're raiding people's
[34:56.840 --> 35:03.360]  houses that was in the mainstream news and Curt Nemo wrote an article about it
[35:03.360 --> 35:07.560]  and gave some of the background history remember when the Mexican cartels and
[35:07.560 --> 35:12.640]  turned out it was the army killed the guy on the jet ski with his wife on that
[35:12.640 --> 35:18.320]  what Falcon Lake bordering that the Mexican Texas border and the national
[35:18.320 --> 35:22.520]  loose came out and said she was lying and then later of course it came out
[35:22.520 --> 35:26.520]  there were their work witnesses he was shot they did get his body they sent
[35:26.520 --> 35:30.240]  Mexican cops to find it and they what decapitated one and killed some others
[35:30.240 --> 35:34.760]  so oh my husband they drove they killed him they they shot him they came up on a
[35:34.760 --> 35:38.840]  boat and shot him oh shut up honey there's no violence on the border on only
[35:38.840 --> 35:42.080]  30 plus thousand dead in the last three years more dangerous than an average
[35:42.080 --> 35:46.920]  here in Vietnam per capita everything's fine there's not giant mass graves
[35:46.920 --> 35:51.600]  everywhere you know I've been doing a lot of radio interviews lately and I'll
[35:51.600 --> 35:58.160]  bring up that the first responders are not allowed at the 9-11 event and people
[35:58.160 --> 36:01.080]  don't believe me even when I tell them search it they just say you're lying of
[36:01.080 --> 36:05.040]  course when they finally find out it's true I'm still the bad guy for pointing
[36:05.040 --> 36:09.720]  it out oh yeah they pulled in a boat and shot my husband in the head no you're
[36:09.720 --> 36:15.560]  lying lady US government came out an attacker federal government there's
[36:15.560 --> 36:23.760]  nothing going on on that border sweetie cake and in Arizona routinely whole
[36:23.760 --> 36:29.520]  whole rural areas in one night what 14 houses got burned down I mean it's just
[36:29.520 --> 36:35.040]  absolute bedlam and the media is like hey everything is a okay by the way
[36:35.040 --> 36:38.960]  there's a Ron Paul interview we did two days ago that I noticed when you go into
[36:38.960 --> 36:42.360]  Google news has made it past their normal censoring of any of our information
[36:42.360 --> 36:46.700]  and it's a really powerful 15 16 minute interview you should get out to
[36:46.700 --> 36:51.120]  everyone you know it's Ron Paul Rick Perry is the globalist choice for 2012
[36:51.120 --> 36:55.760]  please get that video Ron Paul Rick Perry is the globalist choice for 2012 and
[36:55.760 --> 37:01.920]  get it out to everyone you know don't forget tonight 7 o'clock we're trying to
[37:01.920 --> 37:06.080]  keep to 30 minutes tonight my wife's like you have to come home every night at
[37:06.080 --> 37:11.760]  11 my children are like please grab my leg the morning please come home I've
[37:11.760 --> 37:16.040]  got to get where I can just do the news and leave and not do I guess all total
[37:16.040 --> 37:20.960]  last night hour and 40 minutes the news part itself was about 55 minutes long
[37:20.960 --> 37:27.560]  then I also just did some talking but this is a big venture a big operation
[37:27.560 --> 37:31.800]  against the globalist it's bold it's having a big effect we've built all of
[37:31.800 --> 37:35.480]  this because of your support if you're not a prison planet TV member it's 15
[37:35.480 --> 37:40.880]  since a day 595 a month that's 595 a month or get three months free when you
[37:40.880 --> 37:46.760]  sign up for a year and you can go to info wars news calm info wars news calm
[37:46.760 --> 37:53.000]  to sign up and to see the nightly news archive and the live stream of it when
[37:53.000 --> 37:58.200]  it's live the special reports the Alex Jones live that's this radio TV show
[37:58.200 --> 38:03.840]  three hours a day and the Alex Jones ranch area and it's even easier for me
[38:03.840 --> 38:08.480]  to upload to prison planet TV now to info wars news calm in that special area
[38:08.480 --> 38:13.920]  then it is for me to even upload near real-time videos like I do at night at
[38:13.920 --> 38:18.880]  2 a.m. on the weekend on the road so now you're gonna see more and more some of
[38:18.880 --> 38:21.560]  it will be posted on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube that's our overall
[38:21.560 --> 38:26.920]  message to get the word out but you will see it exclusively posted there first
[38:26.920 --> 38:31.880]  and a lot of it will be exclusive to the site by the way we allow because I
[38:31.880 --> 38:37.360]  wish we could allow everybody you to have six logins at once with the same
[38:37.360 --> 38:41.160]  username passcode just don't use the same username passcode you use for your
[38:41.160 --> 38:44.320]  bank account create one that you're willing to give your friends and family
[38:44.320 --> 38:49.280]  that is just on prison planet TV I didn't think I need to explain that but
[38:49.280 --> 38:53.360]  for some folks you know don't don't have it be the code to your alarm at your
[38:53.360 --> 38:59.200]  house obviously but but create a code if you want to share it and just tell
[38:59.200 --> 39:03.640]  people don't give it out to more than five or six people because then if six
[39:03.640 --> 39:08.120]  people are logged on at once with that passcode you will try to go log on and
[39:08.120 --> 39:12.160]  then won't be able to get on but say la vie if you give it out and people use it
[39:12.160 --> 39:16.320]  so much you can't get on sometimes go sign up and get another membership and
[39:16.320 --> 39:22.400]  support us because no good deed goes unpunished it does cause occasionally
[39:22.400 --> 39:26.960]  some issues because people give out their passcode and then others give it out
[39:26.960 --> 39:31.080]  and then I get emails going I can't log in and then we can go check the file and
[39:31.080 --> 39:34.240]  see well yeah there were six people logged in when the show started under
[39:34.240 --> 39:37.800]  your passcode so just give it to your wife your husband your son your daughter
[39:37.800 --> 39:41.600]  grandma your boss one of your employees whatever and just say don't share this
[39:41.600 --> 39:46.320]  but hope you use it and they will use go enter it you can do it or you can just
[39:46.320 --> 39:51.600]  encourage folks to buy a membership you really want to support us we had this a
[39:51.600 --> 39:56.440]  while back I should reinstitute this I think it's still a function we can just
[39:56.440 --> 39:59.320]  flip right back on effect I'll go tell the IT guys to look into this and do it
[39:59.320 --> 40:05.440]  where you could buy maybe five at a time and get a discount five at a time and
[40:05.440 --> 40:12.320]  you know that way five memberships would be five times six we're talking about
[40:12.320 --> 40:21.040]  30-something people being able to get on this thing why not do that prison
[40:21.040 --> 40:26.320]  planet dot TV is the main portal to all the films everything else but for the
[40:26.320 --> 40:30.200]  nightly show the special reports this show you want to watch the video format
[40:30.200 --> 40:33.800]  of it the archives the live stream and the rant section that's behind the
[40:33.800 --> 40:37.960]  scenes on the road you name it prison planet dot TV or find it all in one
[40:37.960 --> 40:45.840]  spot at info wars news.com okay I'm gonna launch the phones here for folks you

[40:55.480 --> 40:59.160]  will get you up and on the air what do you think of the fact that it comes out
[40:59.160 --> 41:04.240]  that the ATF shipping guns all over Latin America and the US to special drug
[41:04.240 --> 41:07.320]  gangs they use to knock out their competition and make sure it gets
[41:07.320 --> 41:12.440]  laundered with the proper banks that run this country Wells Fargo, Wacovia, the
[41:12.440 --> 41:15.960]  rest of them they've all been caught on record if you didn't your new listener
[41:15.960 --> 41:19.800]  you don't believe that just type in 376 billion laundered by Wells Fargo
[41:19.800 --> 41:23.840]  Wacovia in a two-year period they'll get Bloomberg AP another new listener it's
[41:23.840 --> 41:26.520]  hard to believe it's all hidden in plain view if you're a new listener in like
[41:26.520 --> 41:31.720]  he says the Marines on the army grow guard the opium and help load it on
[41:31.720 --> 41:37.160]  trucks just type troops help guard and grow opium put into YouTube you'll
[41:37.160 --> 41:41.320]  probably get 20-something newscast seriously you'll get you'll get
[41:41.320 --> 41:48.240]  everything you can imagine multiple CNN multiple associated press multiple ABC
[41:48.240 --> 41:55.440]  news multiple Fox and it's all the same script the same teleprompter script
[41:55.440 --> 42:05.920]  we've got a guard this and help them or the Taliban will win what the Taliban
[42:05.920 --> 42:11.920]  most the Taliban is just religious fanatics and you've got a drug war going
[42:11.920 --> 42:15.560]  on most the fighting over there is over the opium that's what all the fighting
[42:15.560 --> 42:19.960]  is over and then they got some miscreant quote Al Qaeda people that nine times out
[42:19.960 --> 42:23.280]  of ten turn out to be globalist contractors or operatives just to keep
[42:23.280 --> 42:27.680]  the war going that's the excuse to stay there and get that 500 billion it's
[42:27.680 --> 42:31.200]  funny it's 500 billion they estimate the UN estimates an opium coming out of
[42:31.200 --> 42:35.680]  there every year and it's roughly 500 billion in narcotics and cocaine just
[42:35.680 --> 42:40.280]  our our share of all the different funnels coming in oh you don't think
[42:40.280 --> 42:44.200]  the big megabanks are involved in that grow up ladies and gentlemen you think
[42:44.200 --> 42:50.800]  some crack house down the streets laundering part of that 500 billion no
[42:50.800 --> 42:56.760]  no drugs are made illegal to jack up the prices and create a black market and so
[42:56.760 --> 43:01.880]  selectively the police can be deployed to raid people that are opening up their
[43:01.880 --> 43:07.400]  own shops and shipping in their own drugs at a low-level retail level that's who
[43:07.400 --> 43:11.360]  gets shut down and most the time now the government just tells the drug gang
[43:11.360 --> 43:15.280]  hitting team most of them trained at Fort Benning Georgia we now learn go in
[43:15.280 --> 43:18.200]  there and slaughter all these people you take them out they'll just be
[43:18.200 --> 43:23.040]  statistics is that clear they salute yes sir I mean that that's that's how it
[43:23.040 --> 43:28.360]  runs that's how America runs saluting quote drug cartels Mexican commandos
[43:28.360 --> 43:33.800]  sure remember six years ago we told you all of this before it came out there it
[43:33.800 --> 43:37.280]  is London Guardian how a big US bank laundered billions from Mexico's
[43:37.280 --> 43:41.040]  murderous drug gangs yeah they ended up leasing and running the aircraft as
[43:41.040 --> 43:48.520]  well that was back in April this year but there's an even better one from
[43:48.520 --> 43:53.720]  Bloomberg it's got the 376 billion number on it and what in two and a half
[43:53.720 --> 44:02.080]  year period of gonna be technical so again we're going to be let me just tell
[44:02.080 --> 44:05.960]  GCM live something of the phone board computer interface you've got is another
[44:05.960 --> 44:11.120]  talk show host up so you need to relaunch that I'm gonna exit out John is
[44:11.120 --> 44:18.720]  that good Harmon yeah yeah yeah relaunch that for me because I'm not
[44:18.720 --> 44:21.320]  getting those calls coming through I'm getting somebody else's interface here
[44:21.320 --> 44:27.080]  okay let me get into the other news and then your phone calls like I said Larry
[44:27.080 --> 44:31.040]  Pratt's coming up to get more into that but if you ever need an example that
[44:31.040 --> 44:36.360]  governments are engaged in crime there it is I mean they think you're that
[44:36.360 --> 44:44.000]  stupid that they just do all of this right out in the open okay let me get
[44:44.000 --> 44:50.160]  into the financial news there is some good news here Obama halts controversial
[44:50.160 --> 44:56.360]  EPA regulation and I spent quite a bit of time this morning trying to figure
[44:56.360 --> 45:01.000]  out exactly which group it's not all of them but it's part of a package in
[45:01.000 --> 45:04.920]  I don't think he's actually halting this it's just lawsuits have been filed by
[45:04.920 --> 45:10.640]  states like Texas what is it a more than 20 states of fall lawsuits last time I
[45:10.640 --> 45:13.960]  checked and there's also a bunch of power companies mainly coal powered
[45:13.960 --> 45:19.000]  plants that supply 51% or more of our power the numbers actually growing it's
[45:19.000 --> 45:23.120]  I think 52 now but over half you look at yourself remember Obama said I will
[45:23.120 --> 45:28.280]  bankrupt coal we did that in a report earlier in the week for M4 is not
[45:28.280 --> 45:32.120]  you know is one of the special reports they're saying we will bankrupt you so
[45:32.120 --> 45:36.520]  that's really helping out in court that wow the goal is to bankrupt unless you're
[45:36.520 --> 45:42.160]  general electric and the fact that he gave him that waiver in February really
[45:42.160 --> 45:47.280]  helped the lawsuits that it was so naked see the globalists are smart to a
[45:47.280 --> 45:52.460]  certain level but they're also so arrogant now so pull of bravada hood
[45:52.460 --> 46:01.840]  spell whatever arrogance just just just just blind tuberous is it is a even
[46:02.400 --> 46:09.320]  better word oh yeah they're showing me they're on screen a happy globalist
[46:09.320 --> 46:17.320]  Hillary Clinton is having a great time now continuing Obama halts
[46:17.320 --> 46:23.000]  controversial EPA regulation and they call it smog but then when you read
[46:23.000 --> 46:31.080]  into it it's carbon dioxide and it's ozone and you see they've gotten these
[46:31.080 --> 46:35.400]  plants with reasonable regulations see they're stuck they're stacking all this
[46:35.400 --> 46:40.640]  on reasonable things like catalytic converters and other systems that
[46:40.640 --> 46:45.280]  everybody reasonably called for in the last 30 40 years because nobody wants to
[46:45.280 --> 46:48.800]  breathe smog nobody wants to be poisoned nobody wants to get sick remember
[46:48.800 --> 46:52.120]  driving in as a child in the Dallas we lived right outside Dallas and you'd see
[46:52.120 --> 46:59.960]  a big brown yellow dome over the city of just cooking garbage I remember getting
[46:59.960 --> 47:05.560]  sick driving in traffic with all the stinking cars now you drive by an old
[47:05.560 --> 47:08.240]  car somebody that doesn't have a catalytic converter or a rotted out
[47:08.240 --> 47:12.680]  muffler and you know you get sick right away remember when you were young how
[47:12.680 --> 47:19.320]  bad it was in that congestion the the brain cells dying so all of that's
[47:19.320 --> 47:22.680]  reasonable so then they come in and say yeah we want to stop even more smog and
[47:22.680 --> 47:27.680]  the power plants are like well we've got giant buildings called scrubbers where it
[47:27.680 --> 47:32.640]  goes through all different sorts of systems dry scrubbers wet scrubbers
[47:32.640 --> 47:36.440]  nothing's coming out they have federal sensors by law at the top of the smoke
[47:36.440 --> 47:42.600]  stack if anything comes out other than water vapor and carbon dioxide a
[47:42.600 --> 47:45.840]  lot of the alarms go off they have to shut down the feds have sessions that
[47:45.840 --> 47:49.680]  fly back and forth I've seen them and they admit they have them hundreds of
[47:49.680 --> 47:56.920]  them dozens in Texas over just snooping and and picking up the the the
[47:56.920 --> 48:03.680]  particular so our economy is shutting down and China and Mexico they have no
[48:03.680 --> 48:08.040]  controls they have some of the dirtiest India as well coal power plants in the
[48:08.040 --> 48:14.880]  world very toxic mercury lead all this stuff blasting in even dust ashes
[48:14.880 --> 48:21.920]  raining down on people very bad very bad and so how is shutting down our plants
[48:21.920 --> 48:26.480]  so that select groups that can stay open make bigger profits how does that help
[48:26.480 --> 48:31.880]  the earth when we're one planet and the jet stream takes the Chinese toxic jet
[48:31.880 --> 48:35.160]  stream and brings it right back over the United States and actually the jet
[48:35.160 --> 48:38.600]  stream comes in right over Texas that particular band of the debt jet stream and
[48:38.600 --> 48:43.280]  dumps it in and the environmentalist groups run around getting samples saying
[48:43.280 --> 48:47.440]  look the lead levels up and then lawsuits have come out and proven it's from
[48:47.440 --> 48:51.720]  China and India it's not our power plant see they say all the air is picking up
[48:51.720 --> 48:56.000]  lead and mercury you bet it is that's in that dirty coal and then there's a
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.200]  whole nother level in another level 1996 Clinton took hundreds of thousands of
[49:00.200 --> 49:09.200]  acres of southern Utah land badlands off of mining the only clean burning coal
[49:09.200 --> 49:16.520]  deposits of any large size in the Americas in this entire hemisphere from
[49:16.520 --> 49:20.760]  Alaska down to Chile the only area they had it now it turned out he was involved
[49:20.760 --> 49:24.520]  with a company it was lobbied by a globalist China based company that had
[49:24.520 --> 49:29.160]  the only other big deposit what happened to their stocks overnight doubled
[49:29.160 --> 49:33.640]  profits were incredible then they mandate clean burning coal but now you've
[49:33.640 --> 49:39.720]  got to ship it from China this is how the scams operate now we've got that
[49:39.720 --> 49:43.800]  information now what does Der Spiegel say because I know how to go to a search
[49:43.800 --> 49:53.280]  engine and go to all the major ports on the major seas like San Francisco and
[49:53.280 --> 49:58.520]  others and pull up the water level over the last 100 plus years some of them go
[49:58.520 --> 50:02.400]  back 300 years in Europe San Francisco it's over 150 we've done this on air and
[50:02.400 --> 50:09.120]  showed it to you the water level that the the sea level has dropped remember
[50:09.120 --> 50:11.280]  they said all those islands in the Pacific when we underwater and it's
[50:11.280 --> 50:18.640]  actually dropped and they've been caught in several cases where there'd be like a
[50:18.640 --> 50:21.560]  little iron with a few trees on it where they wanted to take a shot years
[50:21.560 --> 50:25.720]  later they would have amphibious dredges and bulldozers knock it down and kill
[50:25.720 --> 50:31.800]  the trees just to say look the island is submerged I mean these people are hard
[50:31.800 --> 50:38.000]  core well what is Der Spiegel saying Der Spiegel the big German publication
[50:38.000 --> 50:43.960]  global warming now causes sea levels to drop through weather shifts that's right
[50:43.960 --> 50:49.040]  Al Gore said we'd all be dead we'd all be dead if we live on the coast because
[50:49.040 --> 50:52.880]  it was all gonna rise and kill us by what two years ago and now they're saying
[50:52.880 --> 50:57.480]  oh it's dropping as a global warming how about those ice caps haven't melted
[50:57.480 --> 51:01.120]  yet they're getting bigger I will give you the key intel straight ahead we all
[51:01.120 --> 51:04.960]  know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in

[54:31.320 --> 54:34.520]  of the country and other issues and haven't scratched the surface of other
[54:34.520 --> 54:38.680]  news coming up Libyan rebels round up blacks put them in giant concentration
[54:38.680 --> 54:42.720]  camps prison planet dot com we have links to associated press you name it
[54:42.720 --> 54:46.360]  and they're saying hey this is pretty reasonable and they're just taking
[54:46.360 --> 54:51.560]  women children men mowing them down powers off in most the country total
[54:51.560 --> 54:56.160]  bedlam al-qaeda jihad he's running around slaughtering people and I saw
[54:56.160 --> 55:01.520]  comments in my article going jones how dare you you know defend black Africans
[55:01.520 --> 55:07.320]  and be politically correct these are illegal immigrants yeah to Africa the
[55:07.320 --> 55:11.520]  blacks were in Libya first before the Arabs colonized it and I'm not getting
[55:11.520 --> 55:16.200]  into Arab versus black either we're all human beings and I know some of the
[55:16.200 --> 55:21.200]  blacks were fighting on Gaddafi side the point is they said they launched the
[55:21.200 --> 55:27.320]  war because Gaddafi might have shot some protesters who we now know were
[55:27.320 --> 55:31.760]  western-backed al-qaeda rebels with tanks and grenade launchers blowing up
[55:31.760 --> 55:36.960]  police stations it was all a lie if they would have said hey we're gonna foam in
[55:36.960 --> 55:40.680]  a rebellion and take over Libya I would have still said hey let's stay out of it
[55:40.680 --> 55:44.320]  let's you know if you break it you own it I don't like Gaddafi but let's stay
[55:44.320 --> 55:49.680]  out of it you know why so some oil companies can take over no thank you but
[55:49.680 --> 55:56.160]  I wouldn't have been as upset as just the whole lie oh Gaddafi shot some people
[55:56.160 --> 56:00.000]  turn out that was a lie Gaddafi's doing some really mean stuff these are just
[56:00.000 --> 56:03.520]  peaceful protesters turn out they're blowing stuff up murdering people
[56:03.520 --> 56:08.600]  lynching blacks six months ago basically a black person better not show
[56:08.600 --> 56:12.520]  their face in the east of Libya it's kind of like their own Arab hillbilly or
[56:12.520 --> 56:18.640]  something or like you know Louisiana and in the in the 20s it's not it's not
[56:18.640 --> 56:23.120]  don't show yourself at night don't show yourself period and then I get these
[56:23.120 --> 56:27.280]  comments about oh you know there you are defending the African takeover again
[56:27.280 --> 56:30.560]  some of these comments on the article Watson wrote it in full words have got
[56:30.560 --> 56:36.880]  to be a joke fact later Jarron I think I IMG that comment you probably you
[56:36.880 --> 56:44.360]  probably have it but I was gonna read it just the sheer craziness of it oh it's
[56:44.360 --> 56:48.200]  in the guest folder oh here well I haven't even gotten to the top story yet
[56:48.200 --> 56:57.040]  let me find it oh here it is deport these southern Africans to Wednesday King
[56:57.040 --> 57:01.400]  of the whole places northern Africa pal if no one will accept them sterilize
[57:01.400 --> 57:07.360]  them it's sad that info works takes the side of dictators that imports racial
[57:07.360 --> 57:11.560]  aliens and uses them as mercenaries against the indigenous Libyans
[57:11.560 --> 57:17.480]  indigenous Libyans in fours editorial staff are such hypocrites now they side
[57:17.480 --> 57:21.640]  with importing foreigners to use against population and there's a bunch of these
[57:21.640 --> 57:25.560]  and then I get weird comments from people saying they're black people I think
[57:25.560 --> 57:28.520]  some of these are PR firms in fact that let's come back out in the news that
[57:28.520 --> 57:31.920]  Monsanto's got PR firms attacking people posing as commenters by the
[57:31.920 --> 57:36.480]  thousands the federal government does the Pentagon does and I'll see like a
[57:36.480 --> 57:40.160]  month ago saying they're killing blacks that are in Libyan it's like shut up you
[57:40.160 --> 57:44.360]  whitey you know you know good and well that blacks have a right to be in Libya
[57:44.360 --> 57:49.280]  Africa is black it's like you can't even discuss issues without all sides
[57:49.280 --> 57:53.000]  attacking just because they hear a name it's like when I read scientific reports
[57:53.000 --> 57:56.440]  we got a big report tonight on the nightly news where the government knows
[57:56.440 --> 58:01.280]  that bisphenol a and other plastic additives are flipping the sex of men
[58:01.280 --> 58:08.640]  in their endocrine controllers of the brain and actually causing hemathridites
[58:08.640 --> 58:13.320]  to explode if it doesn't change the actual sexual organs it changes the
[58:13.320 --> 58:17.000]  area of the brain and then I get national news stories saying I'm bashing
[58:17.000 --> 58:22.600]  gay people listen if a frog is turned from male to female it's not about
[58:22.600 --> 58:28.200]  bashing a gay frog you know if I talk about the Pentagon's plan to have a
[58:28.200 --> 58:31.960]  quote gay bomb chemical they were going to spray on Iraqis and it's in the London
[58:31.960 --> 58:37.080]  Guardian it's about the plan to do this so we don't reproduce I'm not getting

[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:53.480]  cities back even after November 6 2012 when Ron Paul wins because we're gonna
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:59.800]  put them in the the the White House but our fight's not gonna be over this UN
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:05.280]  agenda the globalization that's taking place in our cities is insane here in
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:09.640]  Lexington Kentucky they charge us because a tax because we have roofs and
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:15.000]  driveways then they in turn take that money and give it away for art for
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.360]  inspiring art on environmental issues and it's all does with it goes back to
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:24.040]  UN agenda 21 they fund the propaganda to push their agenda and they just raise
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:28.080]  taxes and has nothing to do with the earth and that that's the UN model they
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:31.560]  said because they can't get Congress to do it they're gonna do it at the county

[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.520]  it's for the earth when it has nothing to do with the environment but more and
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:49.160]  more we're winning and you're right saying Ron Paul can win pointing out
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.800]  that he's number one number two or number three in all the polls and that
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:55.640]  and that their statement that he can't win as a hoax we've got to parrot the

[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:32.360]  to your calls after Larry leaves us I'm gonna get into our top story even
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:36.200]  Goldman Sachs secretly believes that an economic collapse is coming and it's
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:40.840]  telling their top people to bet on it I'll tell the general public everything's
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:45.920]  fine we're gonna be going over that huge news on that front of course Bob
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.400]  Chapman always joins us in the third hour gold is up 40 something bucks today
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:54.280]  it's getting back up to 1900 levels getting very close to it I want to talk
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:57.960]  about drudge report here for a moment I've always talked about drudge report
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:03.760]  for 16 years that I've been on air well drudge has been the king daddy of
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:08.640]  alternative media and now of course it's admitted that he drives more traffic
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:13.120]  than Facebook Twitter combined more than New York Times it is the absolute
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:18.840]  number one news and information website in the world governments the president
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:23.640]  can call for all the networks to carry a speech and it doesn't drive one-tenth
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:32.080]  the news the drudge report can unless Obama does a hoax or something unless
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:36.600]  they run a hoax like the whole bin Laden thing take coast-to-coast AM since
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:41.480]  George Norie's been hosting it for eight years it grew from already being the
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:45.680]  number one overnight talk show I saw a number just the other day in online
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:52.880]  radio newspaper that had links to the ratings on average now 55% of the total
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:58.480]  radio listening audience overnight of the entire radio audience music talk
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.840]  everything is George Norie think about that in the United States overnight more
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:07.800]  than half the country listening to radios listening to George Norie why is
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:11.960]  that because he covers topics that the mainstream media doesn't he covers a
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:16.000]  wide spectrum of them doesn't mean he agrees with it all or that I agree with
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.240]  it all the point is it's thought-provoking people are in to open free
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:26.280]  discussions and don't trust the system and Norie has taken a more anti-globalist
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:31.440]  patriotic libertarian Ron Paul type stance because that's what he believes in
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:36.400]  and that's made the show even more popular so congratulations to George
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.920]  Norie for it looks like in about six months if he continues to grow at this
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:44.800]  rate he will be bigger than Rush Limbaugh he will have more than 22
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:48.280]  million listeners in a week if you count the weekend that the coast coast
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:51.280]  family is already a lot bigger than Limbaugh and I'm not bashing Limbaugh
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:56.680]  he's the king of any media I mean the nobody's got unless it's a football game
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:01.600]  the national NFL has got 20 something million people you know 10 million a day
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:07.080]  tuning in I mean it's a big deal that we have five million a week tune in million
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:10.680]  a half two million some days two and a half million on AM and FM stations
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:14.520]  internet shortwave it's a big deal to have 600,000 people download the podcast
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:18.520]  every day it's a big deal to be number one on shot cast and have what is it
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:23.600]  over 350,000 listen to live streams every day I mean we are rising as well but
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:29.280]  it's not so much my talent as the information people are hungry for an
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:34.400]  alternative now we've talked about reaching 22 million people we've talked
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:39.440]  about stuff like that but let's talk about the absolute I mean I was there at
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.740]  talkers you know to talk to all the big radio execs and host about my secret
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:47.960]  from coming from nowhere with no advertising nothing and in dominating
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:52.800]  I said I tell the truth I don't script things I don't just try to be
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:55.800]  controversial and you know have flatulent noises in the background like
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:59.320]  Howard Stern or something we actually you know hit the facts people are hungry
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:03.880]  for that I said so just tell the truth it's the same thing with drudge drudge
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:07.880]  has always been number one for 16 years but he becomes more and more number one
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:12.960]  no matter how many times the mainstream media runs the hoax that drudge is no
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:18.080]  longer number one drudge I see this all the time drudge isn't as important as
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:23.520]  he used to be he doesn't set the agenda they're saying that in their feudal
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:28.560]  death rows of the dinosaur corporate horror media I mean if you've been to
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:32.880]  Alexa comm look at the ratings for drudge have you been to all the other
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:39.240]  benchmark actuaries Google analytics the guy's site is going up like a Saturn
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:44.160]  rocket in the deep space straight up and as he gets more hardcore I mean look at
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:50.880]  him front page be afraid he's making a joke out of Homeland Security issuing
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:56.400]  travel advisory for 9-11 and then he says be not afraid big says says no
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:01.360]  credible intel on attacks he links to my news he leads the charge against the
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:10.200]  TSA rapers and the rapist scan systems he's got the headline up there illegal
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:15.640]  workers got billions from IRS and tax credits normally that mainstream article
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:20.160]  would get almost no attention but drudge knows what people are interested in
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:23.640]  it's what he's interested in that's a secret of my show what I think is
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:29.200]  important what concerns me that's what so many times I'll be on my own websites
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.920]  to my own research and go over look at drudge I'm like well that's exactly what
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:35.120]  I think about it that's because it's about being in the reality based
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:40.840]  community drudge tweeted a few months ago a quote I remember my exact quote is
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:45.080]  listen to the show and I said there's no rest for people that live in reality and
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:51.680]  there isn't so again I'm not even here you know saying oh my gosh drudge you're
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:55.600]  so wonderful and obviously I am he's really helped us fight tyranny and of
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:01.200]  course some of the other folks that work with him like mr. curl doing a great
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:09.000]  job what I'm talking about here is the fact that he is successful and two or
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.440]  three people can run a website bigger than the Washington Post New York Times
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:20.840]  Fox News website you name it combined he can do that because he's got the pulse
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:26.280]  of the people you mainstream media folks do not we're sick of garbage we're sick
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:34.520]  of disinfo we're sick of propaganda drudge does stuff like has flashbacks
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:38.840]  where he'll show the State Department five or six times saying Libya will be
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:43.760]  overthrown within weeks Gaddafi'll be out you know within days showing the lies
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.120]  that's all he's got to do is show what they've done now I'm going to your calls
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:50.360]  I just wanted to read some of the numbers here while we're congratulating
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:57.260]  drudge Matt drudge in drudge report calm listen to this thanks for making
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:02.760]  August the second largest month in drudge reports 16-year history the site
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:10.720]  was viewed 914 million plus times 914 million air twenty six thousand four
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:18.640]  ninety eight times up from last year's seven hundred and seventy two plus
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:24.360]  million and six hundred and sixty nine plus million year before that and so you
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:29.400]  see the trend and I see these articles constantly going drudge is dead drudge is
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:33.360]  dead mark twain is dead mark twain's like rumors of my death have been greatly
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:38.520]  exaggerated rumors of my demise it's because they hate it they cannot stand
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:42.960]  it they are pulling their hair out all right enough about Matt drudge I wish
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:46.120]  Matt drudge would come back to a Sunday night radio show again I know everybody
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:51.360]  would love to hear from me okay I'm done I'm done I haven't even gotten to 110 to
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:54.720]  this I'm gonna get to all of it Larry Pratt's coming up but the big one is
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:58.480]  Goldman Sachs says the economy's going under but just like with Timberwolf and
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:04.240]  their division they said we're gonna sell these suckers total bleeping garbage
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:12.720]  we're gonna sell our customers total trash we're gonna right before 2008 you
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:15.520]  know they had the earthquake and one of the executives put a tweet out saying it
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:19.720]  wasn't earthquake it was my wallet hit in the ground let's go ahead and well I
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:23.040]  wouldn't mind I've had a big wall that wasn't a bunch of looted money Carl in
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:28.120]  California thanks for holding it on the air Alex yes sir my brother in free
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:33.760]  humanity welcome to be crazy like Alex Jones I'm trying to get there Carl soon
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:38.200]  calling you from Oregon I'm moving in a month well welcome sir what's on your
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:42.600]  mind getting out of okay I'm sure you're in the mood for good news okay tell me
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:48.760]  Oregon State the state I'm going to is is blocked the use of the USA Patriot Act I
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:53.360]  knew quite a few states had done that did they just recently do it yes I heard
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:57.000]  about that recently I forget where the source was like that that I saw that I
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.520]  think it was on a DVD or something like that anyway that's that's the good news
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:04.160]  three questions for you and then I'll let you get on to other colors because I'm
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:09.160]  I know the time is short here did you know the Federal Reserve buys all US US
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:13.440]  citizens birth certificates to make us it makes us corporate corporate citizens
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:17.080]  you know I didn't used to believe that but I've now seen that that they do in
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.560]  federal documents and internationally at the International Bank of Settlements
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:26.320]  claim all of us as their property and say that we pledge their fiat currency and
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:30.040]  they actually say they own us and that yes the birth certificate in commerce
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:33.760]  that's why they really push to get them filed now and to get you the social
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:39.360]  security number does mark you as chattel owned by the Federal Reserve right
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:43.480]  question number two why doesn't he was speaking about George Norrie why doesn't
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:49.320]  George Norrie believe in the 9-11 wasn't inside job I don't really agree with
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:53.160]  that I've been on his show I've listened to it I work a lot of and I go home a
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:56.840]  lot at 11 o'clock at night and they reared at two hours of a show from the
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:00.720]  night before when I'm driving home went from 10 to midnight before he goes live
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:04.320]  so I probably listen to live in the country now like 40 minutes of the show
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:07.640]  London's I'll sit there in the car you know you know listening for 20 minutes
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:10.240]  in the parking lot my wife comes out and says what are you doing it's almost
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:14.800]  midnight but I mean I hear him all the times say criminal elements were
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:18.520]  involved and allowed it to happen as the pretext to take liberty and he said
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:23.360]  my me on I don't know probably 20 times on 9-11 he's had Jesse Ventura on he
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:27.600]  talks about it constantly so I'm not hearing the same George Norrie that you
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:33.240]  are right third question and I'll let you get on to other colors what is in the
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:37.640]  plot he's got my vote no question I love the guy but what is in the platform for
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:43.520]  Dr. Ron Paul to abolish the globalists well he knows that if you he said
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:48.120]  abolish the Fed many times he says first they want to audit it and then that'll
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:52.560]  be the evidence to get rid of them it hasn't ever been audited and he said
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:56.200]  as president he's not a dictator so he couldn't weigh the magic wand he would
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:00.400]  have to try to you know get Congress with the people supporting him to go back
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:07.320]  to our Republic form of government we have an open carry last night just
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:09.600]  want to let you know about that because you were speaking about guns of just a
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:14.880]  few minutes ago we had an open carry last night at our market night I don't
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:19.440]  know who they were but they were they were utilizing their their constitutional
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.800]  rights to bear arms well I have to say that's the biggest revolution out there
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:26.240]  because if people are calling cops on folks that put their dear rifle in the
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:30.240]  back of their car even in rural areas we've got to start showing our guns
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:35.200]  to everybody so they get it hey moron it's not illegal what else happened with
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:39.360]  it nothing well I heard from a few of the people there I was with my group of
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:43.920]  people the Venice group that passes out the DVDs at the market night said that
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:47.440]  they were apparently we're going to report them to the Department of Homeland
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.680]  Security well God that can report all of us and when Homeland Security comes we
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:55.360]  say we know you ship the guns into Mexico and ship narcotics in and run all

[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:09.440]  deal and of course Larry Pratt the head of Gunners of America really was at the
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:12.720]  tip of the spear breaking this nationally when he was able to get on
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:17.600]  several national television programs the information was already out there the
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:21.560]  ATF agents had tried to go public and said we're ordered to let guns be shipped
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:25.160]  into Mexico that are killing cops and Border Patrol but Larry was really the
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:29.280]  first on Fox and other channels to be able to point out in a national forum
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:35.480]  that indeed the government did know about this and had perjured themselves and
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:39.320]  now it's been confirmed the White House knew in congressional testimony Eric
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:43.840]  Holder did perjure himself as he put out press releases last year bragging about
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:49.360]  their program in plain view and so this should bring them down I hope Republicans
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:53.840]  aren't thinking hey he's dropping politically he's a dead political duck
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:57.800]  let's just you know use his weakness because he's not weak he's launching
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:01.040]  wars without congressional approval carbon taxes without congressional
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:08.680]  approval ATF gun laws without a law power grabbing he's too dangerous okay
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:12.560]  and it's more than that the Republican establishment is engaged in dirty tricks
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:17.000]  as well in the past so we need to see if the Tea Party can really take America
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:23.240]  back and punish Barack Obama Larry Pratt is it not impeachable I mean we
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:26.680]  know it's as you know it's come out that the White House did know and it's
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:29.480]  come out that holders lied I mean shouldn't there be congressional
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:34.120]  impeachment hearings beginning to explore impeachment I think representative
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:38.200]  Dan Issa the head of the oversight committee in the house is heading in
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:43.720]  that direction he's proceeding very methodically because my impression is
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:48.600]  he understands the hostility of the Democrat media and their eagerness to
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:54.540]  defend their colleague heading the current regime and so he didn't want to
[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:58.960]  make any mistakes and his research has been spot on everything he's put out
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:04.320]  has been flawless in fact they tried to do a hit job on him from the New York
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:12.280]  Times and he answered that very effectively this guy is tough smart
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:15.840]  he's caught him in perjury over and over again with the memos and emails yes
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:20.960]  and I think he's going to have perjury charges and obstruction of justice
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:25.760]  charges for refusal to produce information that are eventually going to
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:30.160]  culminate in certainly a contempt of Congress and what what we've been
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:35.720]  hoping is that he might consider having the house appoint a an independent
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:40.360]  counsel put him in the Speaker of Arms Office develop the case present
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:44.760]  charges and have the Capitol Hill police arrest for whatever crimes were
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:49.680]  committed in the White House they can arrest anywhere in the District of
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:54.320]  Columbia so I've been saying that if we see that some of these officials in the
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:58.320]  Justice Department and ATF begin to telecommute from their suburban homes
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:04.200]  you'll know that ICE is about ready to put them in the pokey well it is a good
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:09.400]  sign that the guy had to resign but then a chronicle in a nutshell what fast
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:15.640]  and furious is and then what's happened since then and it was actually the Tampa
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:19.680]  office that was involved shipping the guns into Honduras as well you correct
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:24.520]  him by the container load by the container load man that's a bunch of
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:31.720]  guns they don't do things in the in small ways do they the fast and furious
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:38.240]  was concocted at a multi-agency meeting in October of 09 the ATF being the point
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:43.640]  of the spear but FBI DEA border control and remember they say they knew nothing
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:46.280]  and it was only locals doing this on their own I mean they've been caught
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:51.400]  lying sorry go ahead I know there's so many opportunities to be a little
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:56.800]  excited about this so that the idea was that they took a legitimate police
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:01.400]  operation a sting operation where they would watch a suspicious sale and once
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:06.680]  an illegal act occurred boom they'd make the arrest October of 09 they said let's
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:10.880]  just let the guns go into Mexico now the official line was that way we'll be
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:15.160]  able to somehow track them and see where they go and up to the mr. Biggs of the
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:19.600]  drug cartel well hey we know who the mr. Biggs are the trouble is finding them
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:25.400]  and there was absolutely no way at all that they could once they let those guns
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:30.600]  walk into Mexico they were losing all track of the evidence and you just don't
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:35.960]  do that in police work that's just absolutely inconceivable but regardless
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:42.320]  they've been caught lying about it and and perjuring themselves and continuing
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:46.520]  with what's come out in court what was the breaking point when the head of the
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:51.760]  ATF the nominee the acting head squealed and said listen I didn't do this alone
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:57.560]  the the the FBI the DEA were involved of course the attorney general knows was
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:02.360]  that the breaking point it might have actually been earlier and the ATF
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:09.240]  acting head may have tested test allied as a result of some ratting out that was
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:14.280]  done by Dennis Burke the US attorney in Phoenix who had been the chief of staff
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:22.120]  of Janet Napolitano the secretary of homeland insecurity Burke has been forced
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:28.920]  to resign and I think that was in retaliation for his having pointed the
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:34.480]  finger all the way up to the top now just as you were intro-ing I was looking
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:40.960]  at some info from Mike Vanderboe who is the the blogger who is mainly responsible
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:45.480]  for having dug up all this information that we're now talking about who got in
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:51.800]  touch with the whistle-blowing agents and who got them linked up to Mr. Grassley
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:58.440]  and Mr. Issa in the US Congress this says that now they have possession of
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:02.360]  email that had gone from the head of the Phoenix office where they were
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:08.240]  operating fast and furious to three individuals at in the White House a
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:13.760]  North American Affairs director for Latin America on the National Security
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:21.000]  Council and two other individuals all involved in the National Security Area
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:28.200]  so we've got this thing is so interwoven into what was going on for a
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:33.000]  long time there were a lot of people who had a lot of knowledge about what this
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.920]  was really all about guns into Mexico is only the tip of the iceberg now it's
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:43.320]  guns by the giant container load out of Tampa and other areas of Florida into
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:48.440]  Honduras and one of the things that was also happening and I don't think I've
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:53.200]  been able to mention this on your show before one of the guys that the ATF was
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:58.200]  monitoring as this making these questionable purchases and lots of
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:03.880]  guns and of course getting them walked into Mexico was an FBI informant who'd
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:10.880]  been a drug dealer had been convicted and was given a chance to rat out other
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:16.320]  guys by doing what he was doing as the this straw purchaser so here is this
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:20.400]  FBI agent buying all these guns and apparently he had all this money to buy
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:26.440]  the guns because the FBI the DEA and ICE had made a deal with Sinaloa cartel to
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:30.720]  let drugs into the country so that they could get a cut of that to buy the guns
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:36.120]  cool huh absolutely and that's now come out in the Chicago Tribune and also in
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:41.480]  federal documents is how they got that and of course in the El Paso times now
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:48.360]  Celica Steele a former DEA agent school teacher after he got out of the DEA he
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:52.720]  told us this six years ago that there was already some of this going on and
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:56.200]  then he said about three years ago that it was expanding and he said it had gone
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:00.200]  hog wild under Obama and then they came and arrested him for having a couple
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:05.520]  shotguns and said that he was illegally selling guns and he's now in prison should
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:09.760]  get out soon so we actually knew about this a long time ago just from that one
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:14.000]  source and a couple others that confirmed that was going on but this looks
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:19.840]  like Iran Contra here because you've got you've got the drug dealers allowed to
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:24.280]  bring cocaine in and you've got guns being shipped in Latin America to knock
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:28.640]  out the competition this whole thing I mean but but this is even more cut and
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:34.040]  dry right then Iran Contra I mean there's there should be immediate giant
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:39.920]  congressional hearings on this let's let's make one point here that we we
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:46.160]  don't know yet what Obama knew when nor do we know what Holder knew when but we
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:52.080]  can say this with all Nixonian certainty the fact that they have not fired
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:56.360]  these individuals these four individuals that have been transferred into
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:45:01.000]  Washington jobs they promoted them they well they may not have promoted them but
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.280]  they they moved them in closer to them in their headquarters operation whatever
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:11.560]  the case they didn't fire them that means Obama and Holder own the cover-up but
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:15.180]  that I mean as you said that came out in Congress what is at least it for high
[01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:19.560]  on the White House communicating Mac and forth of course Obama knows this is a
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:24.880]  giant three agency operation of I mean of course they're involved in fact it's
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:31.240]  even more agencies than that it's ATF FBI DEA Border Patrol ICE Coast Guard
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:35.400]  State Department and for whatever reason the IRS maybe they were charging
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:40.480]  sales tax on wow now wait wait wait so I'm learning something here so but but
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:44.760]  again the Attorney General is saying he never knew about it but you've got six
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:50.000]  seven agencies involved this is this is amazing boy I bet Eric Holder can feel
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:55.760]  the flames of his political destruction lapping at his hind end they've you know
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:00.400]  I have I think I said this before this show but I would like to have an
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:06.520]  exclusive dealership at the Justice Department and at the ATF for selling
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:11.840]  the pens because they've got to have the jest of trouble right about now well
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:14.640]  yeah and again they've been trying to cover this up that as you said they've
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:18.480]  had the New York Times Washington Post others attacking anybody that talks
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:23.440]  about this why do you think CBS has been so fair on this CBS is normally one of
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:28.840]  the worst water carriers for Obama noids and and Clinton East is well they
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:35.760]  initially they let go let let her have her way Cheryl Atkinson she is an
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:39.720]  incredible reporter I had lunch with her I still don't know what her politics are
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:45.680]  she is professional and she got the info from Mike Vanderbilt and was willing
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:49.200]  to work with Mike and realize that when she got in touch with the agents that
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:53.920]  yeah Mike knew what he was saying and so she ran with these stories they didn't
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:58.720]  apparently at CBS hierarchy see the political implication right away for
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:04.520]  their their Democrat buds in the regime when they realized that she was able to
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:09.600]  continue reporting but not on television so you have to go to cbsnews.com or
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:13.520]  just go to gunowners.org because we've got a link right to her and you don't
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:18.040]  have to fetch around on their page just go to gunowners.org and she's got a
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:23.480]  wonderful archive of her broadcast and printed or electronic information she
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:28.040]  helps break the story and I've seen it now it's relegated to some under a rock
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:34.720]  place so that shows you're right there well Fox was a long time getting on
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:39.520]  this thing but they now they do I must say they cover it very regularly with
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:43.080]  William Lajanes who's in their West Coast division he's been to Mexico he's
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:47.480]  been to Arizona and he's a good reporter he's doing a good job now we've
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:50.960]  interviewed William Lajanes I remember like ten years ago he did a story on a
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:56.560]  Jenna 21 and UN takeover of America and it showed the Green Police in little
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:00.560]  comedy pieces you know coming and seizing people's houses but but now
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:05.800]  that's actually actually happening now now expanding on two days ago Alex NBC
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:11.160]  had nothing they finally had an article and ABC has yet to show up there's still
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:18.240]  MIA Larry where does it go from here I mean why aren't we seeing Boehner going
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:23.120]  after this why aren't we seeing other Republican leadership in fact I should
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:26.080]  have brought it up with Ron Paul just a few days ago he was on with me they're
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:29.920]  letting Issa take the lead on this thing he's going to have more hearings in
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:34.360]  October he's already indicated that there are a lot of other questions that he
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:38.960]  wants to have answered and I think in due course he's going to make the moves
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:44.800]  and hopefully this is going to become big enough that if nothing else some of
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:49.560]  the Republican candidates ought to take this up and start talking about Obama
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:55.480]  the head mobster and and bring some of this stuff into the discussion as they
[01:48:55.480 --> 01:49:01.680]  give their speeches and I think we may not see action taken against Obama and
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:05.840]  company before the elections but I do think that if we get this word out
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.880]  enough and we have ways of doing that and you're one of the big ways we have
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:16.000]  of doing that he'll be a one-term president well that's great but but but
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.840]  I would also like to see a holder behind bars and I know these are mobsters I
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:22.520]  don't like having to get up here and stand up against them if we get a new
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:27.120]  sheriff and if we have a new attorney general and appointed by a president
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:32.080]  who's got a belly for the fight then I think we could see that because this is
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:38.520]  imagine right now we already know of at least 200 people and counting that have
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:43.880]  been slain using these fast and furious weapons and it's going to continue
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:50.520]  because they've only recovered 600 of the 2000 guns that were let go so you got
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:55.680]  to believe that they're not all going to be in my hunting safe waiting for an
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:50:01.800]  occasional usage and so this means that this thing's going to continue to mount
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:07.080]  and the number of people involved in every one of those guns that was sold
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:12.760]  involved a number of federal and state violations we're hoping that we can
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:17.080]  interest a state prosecutor in reckless endangerment charges conspiracy to
[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:21.480]  commit murder charges because a lot of the people that were involved in this you
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:25.200]  know we were two or three that I can think of right off the top at the
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:29.440]  leadership of the Phoenix office we're directing this well mostly against
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:33.320]  unwilling unhappy agents who were told hey if you don't like what we're doing
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:37.480]  go get another job stay there Larry I want to hit a few final items with you
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:41.200]  on the other side and talk about other gun grabbing issues that are taking place
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:45.840]  but there's another article in Fox News today where it's documented that from
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:49.440]  the beginning federal officials tried to cover up evidence the gun that killed
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:53.160]  Terry was one of the government intentionally helped sell the Mexican
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:57.160]  cartels so there's more evidence of the obstruction I mean we've got these

[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:12.960]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:22.400]  I was talking to Larry Pratt during the break and he said it's the ATF laboratory
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:27.120]  where they set people up all the time they come to your house rate it get your
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:31.240]  semi-auto you bought from the store you haven't altered and they go manipulate
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:35.080]  it to fire full auto and you're going to prison they love the targeting law
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:40.600]  abiding citizens and Larry I have this article of the Orleans County record in
[01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:45.360]  Massachusetts where a retired cop who's run for sheriff no criminal record is a
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:50.600]  gun dealer for many years and they raided his house and called it an arsenal
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:56.880]  and haven't charged him they're just quote taking his guns I see this all the
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:59.720]  time it's kind of people getting arrested for filming police and if that's
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:04.760]  the case that I I saw two those were largely antique guns over which they
[01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:10.200]  have no jurisdiction yeah so I mean they're absolutely lawless and it's not
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:15.160]  uniform there are some for instance in the DC area there's contempt for the
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:20.520]  guys out in the Arizona office and what when the Arizona office wanted to mess
[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:24.840]  around with a small dealer that transferred machine guns for people
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:28.760]  that were buying them and bring them into the state they they couldn't get any
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:34.640]  cooperation from the guys working in the Maryland area they had to send in their
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:39.720]  own guys from the Phoenix office so even in the beat the ATF there there are
[01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:43.960]  those with enough honor and integrity to just say I'm gonna work with people
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:50.640]  like you so I suspect something like that is going on up in Massachusetts and it
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:54.520]  may mean that the the guys in the Boston office are a bunch of bad nicks as well
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:56:00.200]  it's it's you don't know from one office to another whether they're going to be
[01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:04.160]  okay and just try to behave like cops or whether they think they're on a mission
[01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:08.240]  to destroy the Second Amendment well Larry we're gonna talk more tonight on
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:11.600]  info wars nightly news on some of the subjects we haven't had time to get into
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:16.760]  but let's start to cover some of those what's the other threats we're seeing
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:20.880]  right now to the Second Amendment and where does it stand with this extra
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:25.520]  judicial rules now where they're ordering gun shops to report people and not
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:30.160]  sell them you know two or more guns that's the most amazing thing that that
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:34.480]  was what they were hoping to get if they pulled off Fast and Furious and they
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:39.800]  were able to blame you and me for all the guns we own then they get caught in a
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:44.040]  conspiracy to commit murder and they saw well the answer is more control over
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:47.640]  the American citizen so in those four Southwestern states they're telling
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:52.880]  dealers who keep their licenses at the pleasure of the ATF you must submit a
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:58.240]  multiple sales report on anybody buying two or more rifles within a five day
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:04.760]  period that is against federal law the federal law only requires handguns to
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:12.360]  have multiple sales report so once again in Emperor Obama has decided what
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:18.800]  shall be done and the law well just take the hindmost I know you've been
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:24.160]  critical of the NRA because they've actually been pro gun control in the
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:27.560]  past and you've you've published briefs on that but have you looked at their
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:31.880]  lawsuit dealing with these extra-judicial ATF regulations you think
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:36.400]  they're doing a good thing there so far we think so and if it ends up going up
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:41.600]  on appeal it's our intention to file amicus briefs except for the Olufsen
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:46.320]  case we just really have never thought we had the resources to actually do the
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:50.800]  trial litigation work that's that's where the big bucks come in bad enough
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:56.000]  and amicus so we're looking at that and if there are any things that we think
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:59.640]  should be said that are not being said then that's what the amicus brief is
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:03.560]  all about do you think political pressure starting to get to the NRA with
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:06.200]  their members to actually force them to occasionally do something with the
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:10.880]  Second Amendment they've been that way all along really and one of the things
[01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:15.440]  that is interesting is that what you're doing and what the blogosphere does is
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:19.480]  what helps really push them along folks need to sign up for your free email
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:24.080]  alerts that are absolutely essential I know I get them on my iPhone at gunowners.org

[02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:02.040]  20th the opening of the UN General Assembly there's nothing there at all
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:06.680]  and it's a very it's okay to report on it ABC News is reporting on it's CNN
[02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:10.480]  Bloomberg they're all reporting on it but you're not reporting on it and I
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:15.400]  really would like to hear Paul Watson take on it even Aaron Dykes take on it
[02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:19.240]  but you're not covering is there a reason why please respond yeah put the
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:23.080]  camera on me I don't even know what you're talking about I mean I've seen it
[02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:30.120]  in the news I I've read articles on our site concerning it I've read articles
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:35.840]  about violence we had articles about stun grenades being passed out to most
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:41.840]  the Israelis ahead of a new intifada I covered it I think earlier in the week
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:48.080]  and I you know I number one I am sick of hearing about Israel I'm like Ron Paul
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:52.000]  I'm like cut all the foreign funding nobody's gonna attack Israel they got
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:57.760]  800 nuclear weapons at least 400 are admitted high-tech some jet aircraft
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:02.360]  better than what the US has I'm sick of it I don't want foreign aid to Mexico I
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:07.120]  don't want it to Israel and I want it to Egypt I'm done and I'm sick of it I'm
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:12.520]  not obsessed with Israel I'm obsessed with liberty and freedom and I'm not
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:17.640]  even mad at you but you have this accusatory really almost haughty like
[02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:21.840]  satisfaction that you've caught me I'd like to hear and I don't know what
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:26.200]  you're talking about I mean I know that they're having that vote come up I know
[02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:30.360]  they've had all these I mean it's been going on for since 1947 nobody's going
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:35.400]  anywhere and I mean I covered it when the people came out of Syria and got
[02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:41.160]  mowed down and I said that was horrible and wrong and so that's the end of it
[02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:45.520]  I mean you really I don't like being falsely accused of something now I do
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:49.200]  see comments all the time like why aren't you covering this and I'm like

[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:12.200]  to have somebody call in and say where is this information when I know I've
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:17.640]  covered it and seen it it's just bizarre why don't you why don't you do
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:21.080]  a website and tell us about it but again you don't believe me that we covered
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:26.440]  it right because I can't be a good guy is that right Alex I'm your like biggest
[02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:29.240]  supporter but I'm also willing to criticize you where I think you're
[02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:32.600]  soft peddling something no I search your website for making this call day so
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:36.120]  it's not like semi-rational hold on a minute hold a minute there's there's
[02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:40.520]  full stuff out there about me like saying I support the Israeli attack on the
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:45.480]  flotilla which I never said wasn't true and people play the clip and say I'm
[02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:50.040]  saying it when I didn't so there's a lot of weirdness going on here the Israeli
[02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:52.360]  lobby attacks me all the time
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:55.400]  okay but I will not get into this whole
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:05:00.520]  Israel obsession thing I do not is not my religion

[02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:29.560]  important economic news and i'm about to get into and then get
[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:34.040]  bob's expert analysis and take on it last week
[02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:38.040]  well he called the big dip in gold with total precision
[02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:41.640]  it's almost sickeningly accurate we posted his articles from the
[02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:44.920]  international forecaster at info wars.com two weeks ago
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:48.520]  before that happened he did it a day and a half before
[02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:51.960]  then he predicted exactly what it's now done today
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:55.800]  it's getting right up there close to 1900 again
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:57.800]  and so we're going to get his take on where we're going through the rest of
[02:08:57.800 --> 02:09:01.400]  the year with gold silver the economy and your phone calls but if you just
[02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:04.200]  joined us there was a caller earlier erin and
[02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:06.920]  nevada and i guess he's still there and i'm not
[02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:10.760]  going to turn this into a 10 hour uh a discussion but but let me explain
[02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:15.160]  something i don't cover things generally from the
[02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:20.440]  angle of the pro-israel lobby or the anti-israel lobby
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:23.800]  okay when i was mainly a mainline conservative
[02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:26.760]  16 17 years ago and there's clips of this on the web
[02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:31.000]  i was the un doesn't like israel the globalists don't like it so
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:35.480]  israel's okay my understanding has gotten more sophisticated
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:39.400]  but i actually have an allergy to israel okay
[02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:43.400]  i'm sick of hearing about it those people are all going to be killing each
[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:47.960]  other forever and i'm tired of it i don't obsess over australia
[02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:51.960]  i don't obsess over austria i don't obsess over chili
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:57.560]  i don't obsess over timbuktu and i'm just sick of my whole life
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:01.800]  having to hear about israel israel israel palestine palestine
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:05.480]  and then since i've been on air 16 plus years weirdos man
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:09.080]  trying to get me to take on their pet project of you won't talk about
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:13.000]  scientologists all day you must be one look there's a guy named alex jones
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:16.680]  and scientology it's me no it's not i'm not some 65 year old
[02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:20.120]  guy with black hair or alex works for the vatican he spoke at a
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:24.360]  catholic university once when he was ssp you know on and on and on i'm not
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:27.560]  i'm not any of these things okay i don't i don't even go to mainline church
[02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:30.280]  except occasionally and it's Methodist and Baptist
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:34.120]  i'm just a guy who wants peace and liberty i want my republic
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:37.480]  i want the foreign banks out of my country but a guy calls in
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:40.920]  and he says why aren't you care covering palestinian
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:45.960]  statehood vote in the un because i'm sick of it i'm tired of it it's dumb
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:50.760]  nothing's going to change israel's an armed camp with 400 to 800 high-powered
[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:54.440]  nukes submarines jets if palestinians are
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:11:00.440]  arabs are uh uh from the golan out of uh syria come across they're going to get
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:04.440]  shot and and and now you got an arab spring going on
[02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:08.040]  over there that's global is funded we told you years before they were about
[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:13.560]  to do this and it's just a giant quagmire and there's other things going on
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:17.480]  other than this and i'm tired of it and and it's just an example of the
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:20.600]  upset it's like it's like uh common ellen and people
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:24.920]  tell me i got to cover this it's not going to kill us in october
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:31.400]  i have my own issues that i'm into and the sickening religion of obsessing on
[02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:35.800]  israel and bashing israel it's sickening and the sickening
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:40.120]  political religion of worshiping israel but people that aren't even israelites
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:45.720]  or from israel israelis obsessing and and tying it into everything that
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:49.000]  doesn't even matter i mean it's like i'll talk about the
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.280]  price of tea in china and i get some comment about you're just bashing israel
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:55.960]  i'm sick of it i'm so tired of people cornering me and going
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:59.480]  alex i really like you but is it true you're anti-semitic
[02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:04.120]  you know i told the story once i told it a lot now and i'm going to bob Chapman
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:08.120]  and i'll give a last comment to erin and nevada but but i appreciate bob
[02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:13.640]  holding there national forecaster dot com i had a dog named helman
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:20.120]  and i got him in high school it was uh a uh runaway lab and we took him and put
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:23.960]  posters up to make it find out where you know who's he was so we had the dog
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:26.680]  and then i went away to college and him in the apartment
[02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:30.440]  and he would he would he would uh dig out under the
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:34.120]  little tiny backyard thing at the apartment and
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:39.320]  he finally got hit by a car and uh they wanted to chop his entire
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:44.040]  front right leg off and i said no let's just see if the nerves come back
[02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:46.520]  and actually most of them did come back but he had to
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:50.120]  part of the muscle was dead no nerve he had to throw it forward
[02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:53.400]  and i and my parents had three and a half acres they still do
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:58.360]  well that comes in a moment the point is that i would take him to dog parks
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:03.080]  and i would and he liked a jog and i go for two or three mile jog with him and
[02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:08.840]  he'd be swinging his foot for while he ran and
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:14.120]  this uh and and women mainly would say oh what's wrong with your puppy what's
[02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:17.640]  wrong with him what happened to him and they would
[02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:22.680]  talk to the dog like i wasn't there and i'm and and like did he do something to
[02:13:22.680 --> 02:13:26.520]  you and the first 300 or 400 times i would just
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:30.680]  say no he was hit by a car he was hit by a car
[02:13:30.680 --> 02:13:34.680]  no he was hit by cool why is he done well they wanted to chop his leg off
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:38.760]  so it's partially paralyzed but he's able to move it he's happy
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:43.160]  but oh maybe take him to the vet and after a while i'm like shut up
[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:47.480]  shut up control freak you don't know it's not your business
[02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:50.520]  a few times i'm like yes i beat him i beat the dog
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:54.680]  you know it it's just it's just mental illness
[02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:59.160]  ninneeing the show isn't about nitpicking alex jones the globalists are
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:02.760]  coming down on us and i got to go to bob but
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:05.800]  i just gave the dog to my parents he lived many years and died a few years ago
[02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:08.440]  i said he got three and a half acres with a big fence around it
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:14.120]  you please take the dog because i cannot handle the ninneeing comments anymore
[02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:17.080]  over and over they they kneel over the dog go what happened to your paw what

[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:29.640]  i mean if you saw a kid living mother dad it's the same thing it's always
[02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:31.560]  liberal trendies they're not really liberals
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:34.920]  they come around the house or i see him on the park and my son's got a birth
[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:38.520]  mark on the side of his head and they come over to talk to him like i don't
[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:41.560]  exist because they want to take over families they go what happened to you
[02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:43.560]  did somebody do something to you he's like my birthmark
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:47.560]  really is it and i'm like shut up you know at a certain point i but my son's
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:51.560]  there i don't want to get mad i'm like listen you you piece of garbage
[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:55.880]  i'm not even going back i'm done okay uh let's go i mean here's the stupid
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:14:59.560]  article all over the place what does it even mean about
[02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:03.400]  israel's statehood uh yes two-state proposed
[02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:08.360]  1947 should be fulfilled this is constant you in votes constant fracases
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:12.040]  and you want me to be obsessed with your fracas okay
[02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:15.000]  what's your take on all this bob bob Chapman do you get where i'm going with
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:21.000]  us i am here and uh as the barred said
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:26.200]  much to do about nothing oh you don't think this is jointly important and we
[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:29.640]  need to just completely talk about israel all day
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:35.560]  no i what i think is that it's important but uh you can't be possessive
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:39.000]  about it there's all kinds of other things going on in the world you got to
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.480]  tie them all together and that's what you do
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:45.560]  so you know just overlook these people who
[02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:49.640]  sometimes are more uh aggressive than they should be uh
[02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:53.960]  and you have your own agendas that you like and i do too
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:57.880]  uh it doesn't even matter one of them today we've got
[02:15:57.880 --> 02:16:02.040]  uh gold up uh almost 50 dollars and i'm almost
[02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:06.040]  25 dollars well actually 23 dollars short
[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:09.720]  of my prediction last week it was going to go up 200 bucks
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:14.840]  and uh i'm very happy about that and i'm very happy about the the bankers are
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:17.800]  getting their feet screwed to the floor
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:20.920]  but we're going to talk about gold coming up and again i i should have even
[02:16:20.920 --> 02:16:23.400]  gotten mad at the guy it's just it's like a broken record
[02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:28.200]  now listen you're under a lot of pressure and he should understand that
[02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:33.400]  well it's like a barking dog i've got a chihuahua as well it knows how to
[02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:37.000]  get at the back door and wants to be let out now you know it it it wants back in
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:40.200]  and he goes
[02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:44.440]  and a perfect frequency that drives you crazy now here's what i get
[02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:46.920]  i've been talking about this the whole show bob and i want to get your take and
[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:50.200]  your view on this first and then we'll get into all the other news
[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:53.880]  obviously the wall street journal ran a story didn't get really any attention
[02:16:53.880 --> 02:16:57.880]  goldman takes a dark view a private note to hedge fund
[02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:03.080]  clients gives a strategist views ways to gain from global pain
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:06.200]  and just like with timber wolf and other groups that they controlled
[02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:09.880]  they were telling their clients by this it's great but then sending emails to
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:12.920]  each other saying look at these idiots this is total bleeping garbage
[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:17.720]  now here's the article from economic collapse at info wars.com
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:21.560]  even Goldman Sachs secretly believes that an economic collapse is coming
[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:24.920]  Goldman Sachs is doing it again Goldman is telling the public that
[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:29.560]  everything is going to be just fine but meanwhile they're advising their top
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:35.000]  clients to bet on a huge financial collapse on august 16th a 54 page
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:38.200]  report authored by gold golden strategist
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:43.480]  alan brazil was attributed to institutional clients the general
[02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:45.320]  public was not intended to see the report
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:49.560]  fortunately some folks the wall street journal got a copy of it and they say
[02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:54.760]  basic total collapse bet against it you know bet bet on the collapse
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:58.040]  while they have their front man they literally bought and paid for telling
[02:17:58.040 --> 02:18:00.760]  us the economy is getting better everything's fine
[02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:04.440]  everything's fine bob Chapman they've engineered this haven't they
[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:09.560]  they certainly have and they don't care about anything
[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:12.840]  other than the fact that they're going to profit from it
[02:18:12.840 --> 02:18:17.400]  and in this case their clients as well they should have been on board a long
[02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:21.960]  time ago we had 11 years now of upside in gold and
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:27.880]  silver which is the antithesis of a good economy
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:31.800]  good finances etc and they could have been doing that no
[02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:35.480]  they were shorting uh gold and silver along with
[02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:42.120]  the jpn hsbc city and so on and uh that was because
[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:46.040]  they didn't want gold to do well because
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:50.200]  historically it's the canary in the coal mine so to speak
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:54.200]  and when gold goes up and silver go up there's a problem
[02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:57.240]  and they didn't want anybody to know there was a problem
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:19:01.480]  now they're saying there is a problem to a select few
[02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:05.160]  and this is what we think you should do to protect yourself
[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:08.120]  whether they talked about gold or not i don't know
[02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:13.400]  but when i can call the market the way i have
[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:18.360]  which is absolutely incredible i i don't ask me how i do it
[02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:21.640]  all i can say that there's a hand on my shoulder
[02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:26.280]  doing something that i don't know how to do but i do it anyway
[02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:33.400]  and we've got them nailed this is all part of this whole syndrome
[02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:40.120]  of world government control of finances control of currencies
[02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:43.400]  burying the people so that they'll accept world government
[02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:47.880]  it's an integral part of all of those things and what you do
[02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:52.200]  and what i try to do is bring them all together in a package
[02:19:52.200 --> 02:19:55.960]  and explain it simply all right stay there let's come back and look
[02:19:55.960 --> 02:20:01.000]  at how bad the economy really is where golden silver's going

[02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:17.880]  it's not anywhere near that many if you type in
[02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:23.640]  you and vote on palestinian statehood just that combination i knew i'd read
[02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:26.200]  like 10 of them on the site in the last two weeks
[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:32.280]  and talked about it attacks in israel as palestinian statehood gains
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:37.720]  there's the top thing info wars.com house gop targets un over palestinians
[02:24:37.720 --> 02:24:41.720]  info wars.com three days ago
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:46.040]  palestinian statehood obama's challenge that's a daily beast
[02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:49.400]  israel stock up on stun grenades three days ago
[02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:54.040]  first un statehood i mean it's just ridiculous
[02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:58.280]  how many articles we've got and the guy doesn't even matter
[02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:01.640]  it makes me not even want to cover it even less because i'm so sick of those
[02:25:01.640 --> 02:25:06.360]  numbskulls man their lies their obsession over nothing in the galaxy
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:10.200]  exists in israel they are israel worshipers the israel bachelors
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:13.800]  have given their total soul over to talking about it
[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:17.320]  it's like i want to vomit man
[02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:23.560]  anyways going back to bob Chapman here you just tuned in somebody was accusing
[02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:27.560]  us of not covering that i was like yeah we i've seen those articles last week
[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:33.080]  no you haven't i searched entirely well i took 10 seconds and found that you
[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:38.040]  okay okay okay doesn't matter doesn't matter
[02:25:38.040 --> 02:25:41.800]  uh boy it's like these idiots saying that i
[02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:45.560]  i'm siding with qaddafi because i'm against the murder of blacks in
[02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:49.320]  in libya what does that have to do with it there is genocide going on there
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:52.840]  we'll get bob Chapman's take on that bob how big of a deal is it though that
[02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:56.520]  goldman is telling their big insiders bet against the economy
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:26:00.040]  it's going to implode how bad is it going to get
[02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:04.200]  first of all it's a very big deal because they're insider insiders
[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:09.640]  they create the inside news uh they're in a position where they
[02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:13.000]  connect with all of the most important people
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:17.400]  in the world behind the scenes that you and i never hear about people who are
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:21.640]  very very powerful that if they were somebody told us their name we
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:27.240]  wouldn't know and it's the admission itself
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:31.000]  to their people who are special to them sometimes
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:34.840]  as clients that look this is what's going to happen
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:39.560]  and this is what we got to do to protect you i have to assume they're telling the
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:44.520]  truth uh sometimes they don't but i would think to
[02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:49.560]  these people who are their clients they would tend to tell them the truth
[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:54.680]  and so the admission itself that we're on a one-way street
[02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:59.080]  and we're headed towards real economic and financial problems
[02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:02.760]  is is a big thing it's very very important
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:06.360]  it bears out with you and i and others like us
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:09.880]  from a different perspective have been saying for a long time
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:16.040]  and i think that news like this gives us enormous credibility and we should
[02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:21.160]  capitalize on it it's very important because
[02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:25.480]  they're saying the same thing that we are for the same reasons
[02:27:25.480 --> 02:27:29.800]  bob aren't we in a race to get the word out that it's the globalist that
[02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:33.160]  engineered this because if we don't educate the public as ron paul has said
[02:27:33.160 --> 02:27:37.160]  they're going to pose as the saviors again a i want you to speak to that
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:41.400]  but b there's this weird schizophrenia and and that's what gets to me is people
[02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:45.160]  not being logical where we put out our economic analysis
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:49.240]  decades before when we saw derivative scrapped
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:52.920]  the controls on it you george humphrey countless others i was
[02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:56.680]  interviewing at the time broke it down and helped educate me about it
[02:27:56.680 --> 02:27:59.560]  and now we're here they've known the whole time
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:02.600]  we simultaneously get called cooks for being right
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:07.800]  while the establishment itself admits this is what's going to happen
[02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:12.680]  well that that's typical it happens frequently
[02:28:12.680 --> 02:28:17.720]  and that's okay we have skin skin like the armadillos have they don't have to
[02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:21.160]  have that because they're in a position to make the rules so we're going to
[02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:24.520]  change that for them uh three times in the last three years
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:29.400]  the big it's a big new place in ski told members of the council and
[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:33.160]  foreign relations look we got these people out there that telling
[02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:36.520]  everybody the truth we're going to stop them if you don't stop we're in
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:39.480]  serious trouble we've talked about this on the program
[02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:44.280]  before and your exact words is we're breathing down their collar

[02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:45.080]  and get into some other news but i was just showing a clip of laura ingram's
[02:33:45.080 --> 02:33:49.320]  radio show with uh dick cheney on it and she introduces
[02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:53.240]  him as darth vader and dick cheney says he's honored to be compared to darth vader
[02:33:53.240 --> 02:33:57.480]  because of the power of darth vader well i'm the first person i know
[02:33:57.480 --> 02:34:01.400]  going back about eight years ago to start comparing dick cheney to darth vader
[02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:06.040]  i believe i did coin that but not because he's powerful like darth vader
[02:34:06.040 --> 02:34:09.400]  but because he's bionic and had all those heart attacks
[02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:13.640]  and was basically being kept alive and now he literally has an artificial
[02:34:13.640 --> 02:34:16.760]  heart on the outside of his body and has no pulse
[02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:20.840]  he can't make this stuff up and few have lived past a year
[02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:23.480]  with the type of heart he's got because most people get so depressed over not
[02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:28.520]  having a pulse uh dick cheney on tv like turns off them
[02:34:28.520 --> 02:34:32.280]  i saw a reference to him turning turning it off and laughing as the alarm goes
[02:34:32.280 --> 02:34:37.080]  off on tv to freak somebody out i mean i guess he is like darth vader he is
[02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:39.640]  pretty tough i mean not even care if he doesn't have
[02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:43.160]  a beating heart just to but but you know conservatives are like
[02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:45.960]  cheney's tough cheney gets stuff done he's a
[02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:49.400]  conservative and then you actually look at dick cheney's real record
[02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:51.720]  it's not conservative to butcher the bill of rights
[02:34:51.720 --> 02:34:55.640]  and constitution what's your view of uh dick cheney now that his new
[02:34:55.640 --> 02:35:02.360]  book is out everything else bob chevin don't go hunting with him
[02:35:02.360 --> 02:35:07.960]  oh man hey i want to bring something else up to you have you seen these photos
[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:11.080]  of the guy that's got six fingers and six toes
[02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:14.120]  but they're not like little bitty vestigial ones he's actually got the
[02:35:14.120 --> 02:35:19.960]  full deal going no i have not seen such
[02:35:19.960 --> 02:35:24.360]  don't know anything about it yeah it's uh it's uh pretty wild and it's got
[02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:28.360]  photos of him climbing coconut trees pretty amazing
[02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:31.000]  hey more and more of us are going to be like that with all the gmo reading
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.880]  and it's been proven they cause mutations
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:36.200]  maybe that's the new thing maybe if someone was allowed you know eight
[02:35:36.200 --> 02:35:40.280]  fingers eight toes on each each
[02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:44.200]  well maybe maybe maybe but uh let's do something better than that
[02:35:44.200 --> 02:35:48.600]  let's try to find a way to stop gmo foods
[02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:52.200]  well that's the thing you know they corner the market on environmentalism
[02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:56.840]  claiming it's carbon taxes let's tax carbon dioxide and water vapor
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:36:00.360]  but then they ignore all the real issues uh what do you make of obama
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:02.840]  announcing he's going to back off on some of the uh
[02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:06.520]  carbon regulations a and if you've seen der spiegel
[02:36:06.520 --> 02:36:09.800]  they now say the sea level is dropping because of global warming
[02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:14.120]  because that kind of blew up in their face that sea levels have dropped bob
[02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:17.960]  well as far as the sea levels are concerned uh
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:21.560]  well the past couple of years generally speaking worldwide
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:27.560]  things have been cooler and so they again still don't have a leg to stand on
[02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:32.280]  and it's still gobbly goop uh we know why they want carbon taxes
[02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:35.640]  is because they just want to rob us a little bit more
[02:36:35.640 --> 02:36:42.840]  worldwide and not just in america and uh because of their control of politicians
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:46.760]  uh they're able to get away with legislation that
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:51.080]  causes these things to become realities such as in australia
[02:36:51.080 --> 02:36:56.760]  i mean the public is up in arms oh they're new carbon tax
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:37:02.440]  businesses are going out of business uh some of the businesses are raising their
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:08.680]  prices by 30 and 35 and 40 to offset the cost of this
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:12.680]  monstrosity it's really a private vat paid to certain companies and by the
[02:37:12.680 --> 02:37:15.480]  way i get emails from people saying they want to see the proof
[02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:19.320]  guys type in australia green police australia green police one of the top
[02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:22.520]  links is a major paper saying home inspections
[02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:26.200]  to happen under green police since from a year ago it's now begun
[02:37:26.200 --> 02:37:30.280]  it's the same global model of what they're doing but i mean
[02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:34.200]  bob what do you make though of the fact that obama's starting to have to back
[02:37:34.200 --> 02:37:38.360]  off that al goers admitted that he's basically a laughing stock most places
[02:37:38.360 --> 02:37:41.000]  now we're really starting to win on this issue
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:44.360]  and that shows that these people are not invincible
[02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:49.400]  you're absolutely right it came about two to two and a half years ago
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:53.880]  uh just a little over two years ago and uh
[02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:57.560]  that information that came out about the
[02:37:57.560 --> 02:38:02.360]  lies and discrepancies uh regarding global warming
[02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:05.880]  those exposes and they started the whole thing
[02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:09.960]  and but yet they keep hard on doing it uh like they
[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:12.920]  were masters of the universe and everything that they said was true and
[02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:17.240]  they're always right and uh they're wrong and uh
[02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:20.840]  it's up to us to tell the world know those people are wrong over there
[02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:24.920]  and his why but again it's not just that they're wrong
[02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:28.280]  they came up with a scam where they could keep their factories open
[02:38:28.280 --> 02:38:31.640]  and shut everybody else's down or charge people a mafia tax
[02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:36.200]  now there's the headline australia's carbon police may enter homes
[02:38:36.200 --> 02:38:40.600]  and it means not they may i mean they may like they're allowed to in fact blow
[02:38:40.600 --> 02:38:44.280]  that up for me please i forget which publications i know it's one of
[02:38:44.280 --> 02:38:47.640]  their papers um i'm watching on a screen across the room that's the
[02:38:47.640 --> 02:38:51.720]  environmental leader and it says federal police may be
[02:38:51.720 --> 02:38:56.280]  forced to become carbon cops under the australian government's
[02:38:56.280 --> 02:38:59.880]  uh blow it up a bit because i can't read it from that distance
[02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:04.280]  under the australian government's okay uh you can go read the article folks if
[02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:07.400]  you want to under the australian government's
[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:12.600]  climate laws to cut greenhouse emissions reports the herald sun he can
[02:39:12.600 --> 02:39:14.840]  link to the herald sun yeah that was the one i found the
[02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:18.600]  guys found that one good job finding that uh so quick
[02:39:18.600 --> 02:39:23.640]  i mean doesn't so much of this rest on exposing these diabolical people
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:27.800]  but that's what it's all about for us a chapter in verse
[02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:32.280]  we gather the information and we give it to them because major mean is not going
[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:37.480]  to do that because they control it worldwide and you know
[02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:41.720]  you're getting them and i'm getting them and that is emails
[02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:46.840]  from all over the world saying thank you for telling us the truth
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:51.160]  or you know you save my bacon because i didn't go out and
[02:39:51.160 --> 02:39:55.320]  invest in bonds or stocks and i invested gold and silver and made a whole pile
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:39:59.960]  of money and on and on and on i get 20 or 30 of them a day
[02:39:59.960 --> 02:40:03.240]  and i certainly don't get the exposure you get so you
[02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:07.960]  you must get 100 to 200 of them a day uh thousands we're here for
[02:40:07.960 --> 02:40:11.640]  we don't we don't care about the accolades we don't care about getting
[02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:15.320]  rich we care about saving humanity and this is
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:19.160]  really what this is all about but the accolades are good the feedback's good
[02:40:19.160 --> 02:40:22.440]  because it's like a sonar ping it lets you know the effect you're
[02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:26.040]  having uh now now and that's bob's point i want to go to
[02:40:26.040 --> 02:40:29.240]  calls bob but a few other economic numbers here
[02:40:29.240 --> 02:40:33.880]  you know they tell us inflation uh is uh you know five six percent what is it
[02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:36.840]  really they tell us jobless numbers are nine point one
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:40.760]  what is it really they tell us uh that unemployment
[02:40:40.760 --> 02:40:45.720]  uh you know it's a lot lower my number is 22 percent what are the real economic
[02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:47.800]  numbers here because they've gone from telling us
[02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:51.400]  we left the recession three years ago or two and a half years ago to
[02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:55.080]  we may go back into a recession now they're calling it the greatest recession
[02:40:55.080 --> 02:40:59.080]  how long have we technically been in a depression
[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:02.520]  uh two years ago february so that would make it
[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:07.160]  29 30 months something like that and it's an inflationary
[02:41:07.160 --> 02:41:11.080]  depression and i'm the only one that's come out and said that
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:14.360]  nobody else has and it's been a long time now
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:18.360]  but that's what we're going through the government is talking about three point
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:23.080]  six percent inflation john williams the eminent economist
[02:41:23.080 --> 02:41:26.440]  who uses a number of models one of which is
[02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:34.440]  the model we had in 1980 to grade inflation the cpi at that time
[02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:40.840]  and he comes up with a figure of 11.2211 percent and i believe john i don't
[02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:43.400]  believe the government as far as unemployment's
[02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:47.400]  concerned the government's talking 9.1 percent
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:53.320]  that's only u3 there's u1 u2 u3 u4 u5 and you add them all up and you get
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:42:00.600]  u6 now u6 is 16.7 approximately percent
[02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:03.720]  i can't remember the exact number but it's in that vicinity
[02:42:03.720 --> 02:42:08.120]  and if you remove the brit death ratio which is
[02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:12.120]  the jobs that were made or the jobs that were eliminated
[02:42:12.120 --> 02:42:16.440]  that they guessed that totally bogus figures if you eliminate that
[02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:23.400]  you get 22.6 percent so there's your numbers all lives
[02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:26.920]  and by the way that's what's the real world that's what 60 minutes came up
[02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:31.720]  with last november they had 33 percent for california
[02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:34.520]  isn't the system losing any credibility they had left
[02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:37.320]  by still stonewalling and saying the economy's great
[02:42:37.320 --> 02:42:42.440]  but everybody knows it's not well i'll tell you this
[02:42:42.440 --> 02:42:47.160]  without the population it's working because they've been so conditioned
[02:42:47.160 --> 02:42:52.440]  to watching whatever newscast or listening to whatever newscast that they
[02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:56.120]  accept with government through these media
[02:42:56.120 --> 02:42:59.560]  organizations has to say and you know something
[02:42:59.560 --> 02:43:04.360]  we're never going to capture that half they're the same half that's been
[02:43:04.360 --> 02:43:09.400]  in every country for centuries they're just the people who
[02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:12.760]  don't think deeply and the rest of the people
[02:43:12.760 --> 02:43:16.840]  have the world on their shoulders and the other people we're trying to get to
[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:22.280]  we're not going to get to all of them but if we only get to 15 or 20 percent
[02:43:22.280 --> 02:43:25.720]  it's a giant victory because these are the people
[02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:32.520]  who are in industry and in services some of them are even in government
[02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:37.880]  and they are leaders or semi-leaders and so those are the people
[02:43:37.880 --> 02:43:41.560]  who generally speaking make those kind of decisions
[02:43:41.560 --> 02:43:44.680]  that are important and those are the people we're trying to reach
[02:43:44.680 --> 02:43:48.680]  and we are reaching them i mean i get a lettuce every day gee
[02:43:48.680 --> 02:43:52.440]  i started listening to you two or three years ago whatever the case
[02:43:52.440 --> 02:43:56.760]  and i did what you told me to do i it was really hard for me
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:44:01.000]  and gee everything i've got is doubled in value
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:04.520]  and the gold silver arena and i can never thank you enough
[02:44:04.520 --> 02:44:09.160]  and these are very intelligent people who just didn't know
[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:12.600]  who happened to turn on the radio one day and there we were
[02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:16.040]  and they learned and they took advantage of it and it's wonderful
[02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:20.040]  yeah you're right i want to go to jeremy i want to go to

[02:46:35.800 --> 02:46:41.720]  2000 2200 during september october would be fine uh i'm looking at the end of

[02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:54.200]  somewhere in there uh jp morgan chasen hsbc are going to get stuck
[02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:59.880]  deeply which makes me feel very good because they're very short and i'm
[02:46:59.880 --> 02:47:02.760]  seeing a lot of short covering in the gold and silver
[02:47:02.760 --> 02:47:07.560]  shares uh of all kind types i can't believe
[02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:12.120]  and i was a trader for 25 years i can't believe they're shorting stocks at 50
[02:47:12.120 --> 02:47:15.960]  cents that are now selling at 75 and they're short
[02:47:15.960 --> 02:47:21.240]  millions of shares mostly naked and they're doing the big stocks too
[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:24.600]  so you're saying in layman's terms bagged that they're in you're saying in
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:28.200]  layman's terms they're doing very reckless things right now
[02:47:28.200 --> 02:47:33.320]  they have been and the tide is turning against them
[02:47:33.320 --> 02:47:38.040]  and uh take some big losses and goldman sacks internally selling insiders
[02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:41.720]  collapse and they're talking about as early as three
[02:47:41.720 --> 02:47:44.760]  months from now do you concur with that analysis
[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:48.680]  uh very possible and they got mr blank fine
[02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:52.760]  now that's the fellow who's the ceo of that company
[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:59.320]  goldman sacks who told us that he was doing god's work
[02:47:59.320 --> 02:48:03.640]  and i think they're going to indict him we'll get the details later he's hired
[02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:07.640]  a criminal attorney so it's pretty serious let's go to jeremy in wisconsin

[02:54:13.640 --> 02:54:19.160]  really good best stop monday and we'll see you back tuesday
[02:54:19.160 --> 02:54:22.120]  with not just the radio show but info works nightly news
[02:54:22.120 --> 02:54:25.960]  bob chatman's our guest let's go to a cliff in arkansas
[02:54:25.960 --> 02:54:29.800]  cliff you're on the air thanks for holding sir no problem that
[02:54:29.800 --> 02:54:33.800]  uh there's one thing i wanted to have everybody to
[02:54:33.800 --> 02:54:38.200]  actually realize is that if you take all the so-called conspiracies
[02:54:38.200 --> 02:54:44.760]  like uh the atf taking guns uh the federal agents taking
[02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:49.720]  gold and silver away from normal people and what i believe is that
[02:54:49.720 --> 02:54:53.960]  the government is basically trying to or the globalists
[02:54:53.960 --> 02:54:57.400]  are basically trying to get to where you can't defend yourself
[02:54:57.400 --> 02:55:01.000]  and if you do get away to defend yourself you can't have
[02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:04.840]  or set up a another economy without their help
[02:55:04.840 --> 02:55:08.280]  no that's it no no of course that's what gmo's about worldwide it's about
[02:55:08.280 --> 02:55:12.920]  taking over economies where you're dependent that's the key to slavery
[02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:16.200]  and now the feds are calling themselves as in the um
[02:55:16.200 --> 02:55:20.040]  hallmarks post yesterday the federal family and they teach them
[02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:25.400]  fema is basically you can't make this up the head of the new federal
[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:31.320]  family like lakosa nostra our thing the family bob chatman
[02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:37.320]  agreed and also along with intimidation that's a very very important part of it
[02:55:37.320 --> 02:55:41.880]  to be terrified that maybe they're going to come and get you because you buy 500
[02:55:41.880 --> 02:55:47.320]  rounds of ammo or how you own 10 american eagles or whatever
[02:55:47.320 --> 02:55:51.240]  and uh their influence uh on the economy
[02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:56.680]  our economies of the world and uh bringing on this entrapment process
[02:55:56.680 --> 02:56:03.800]  where people become enslaved as you say and and and more and more i mean it's
[02:56:03.800 --> 02:56:06.920]  like arresting people and charging them with life in prison for videotaping
[02:56:06.920 --> 02:56:10.120]  police in public they know it's not illegal
[02:56:10.120 --> 02:56:14.200]  they're there to try to scare people and look you don't lay down the bullies
[02:56:14.200 --> 02:56:17.320]  folks that isn't going to appease them it's time to say
[02:56:17.320 --> 02:56:22.280]  look good people in government better decide to join with other good people
[02:56:22.280 --> 02:56:26.280]  at the end of the day bob i i think god's put me here and put you here
[02:56:26.280 --> 02:56:29.960]  so people at least hear the truth and they have a chance to make the decision
[02:56:29.960 --> 02:56:36.360]  what side they're on in eternity absolutely and you know i never ever
[02:56:36.360 --> 02:56:40.280]  thought that i would ever end up in this position
[02:56:40.280 --> 02:56:44.120]  i mean when i retired as a stockbroker 52 years old and
[02:56:44.120 --> 02:56:50.600]  i got bored and i started the publication from scratch uh i never knew
[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:53.640]  that there was a whole new meaning in life for me
[02:56:53.640 --> 02:56:57.960]  and something for me to do uh which was very helpful to other people
[02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:03.240]  yeah appreciate the call clef good points ken and alabama you're on the air
[02:57:03.240 --> 02:57:07.080]  hello alex i'm my first-time caller thank you welcome
[02:57:07.080 --> 02:57:10.200]  yeah thank you honor privilege to talk to you sir uh you kind of stole my
[02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:12.440]  thunder there you've already mentioned his name but i was just going to tell you
[02:57:12.440 --> 02:57:14.920]  about a great website run by a guy by the name of john
[02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:17.560]  williams who is a great economist and statistician
[02:57:17.560 --> 02:57:21.240]  and when you go to his website shadow stats dot com
[02:57:21.240 --> 02:57:24.200]  shadow stats dot com and you click on the alternate data
[02:57:24.200 --> 02:57:28.040]  he's got some great graphs and charts there and uh one of them
[02:57:28.040 --> 02:57:31.880]  particularly i was interested in is the gdp the gross domestic product
[02:57:31.880 --> 02:57:35.560]  because he's quoting it uh the way it really is after you subtract the
[02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:38.520]  high rate of inflation which is now about 10 or more
[02:57:38.520 --> 02:57:42.840]  he's showing the economy in negative territory and headed down it's uh
[02:57:42.840 --> 02:57:46.600]  about a negative three percent right now so the economy is definitely shrinking
[02:57:46.600 --> 02:57:49.480]  right now yeah i want to get john williams on we've
[02:57:49.480 --> 02:57:53.320]  sent a few emails over the years perhaps listeners should hit him up
[02:57:53.320 --> 02:57:57.480]  but bob is on par with williams maybe even better in some ways but
[02:57:57.480 --> 02:58:00.200]  very respected we want to get him on dealing with that bob jetman your
[02:58:00.200 --> 02:58:04.520]  comments well i don't compliment a lot of people but uh
[02:58:04.520 --> 02:58:08.840]  he's doing a great job and he's wonderful at what he does
[02:58:08.840 --> 02:58:13.640]  uh i can't say enough nice things about it i don't know him personally
[02:58:13.640 --> 02:58:18.440]  i just know his work and if you can get him on i think that would be wonderful
[02:58:18.440 --> 02:58:22.520]  because i think it'd give people an insight to the things that i just kind
[02:58:22.520 --> 02:58:26.760]  of gloss over because i i cover so many avenues
[02:58:26.760 --> 02:58:29.400]  sure he just covers he just covers the fake stats
[02:58:29.400 --> 02:58:33.640]  thank you so much uh caller we appreciate that you know what i promise

[02:59:52.120 --> 02:59:58.440]  coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting
[02:59:58.440 --> 03:00:02.920]  network network from the front lines of the
[03:00:02.920 --> 03:00:11.960]  information war it's alex jones
[03:00:11.960 --> 03:00:15.320]  okay well i must have not made it clear because all the callers hung up even
[03:00:15.320 --> 03:00:18.040]  though i said i was going into overdrive just to talk to you because i don't want
[03:00:18.040 --> 03:00:21.720]  to make you hold but the calls are all flooding back in right now
[03:00:21.720 --> 03:00:25.240]  so we'll take a few with bob chappan but briefly bob what about this article
[03:00:25.240 --> 03:00:29.400]  in the new york times us has set to sue a dozen big banks
[03:00:29.400 --> 03:00:33.480]  over mortgages um the federal government's openly bankrolled by these
[03:00:33.480 --> 03:00:36.360]  big banks bought and paid for and generally i've seen
[03:00:36.360 --> 03:00:40.040]  them do these investigations just to politicize it and then slap a few
[03:00:40.040 --> 03:00:43.320]  rest or send some low level guy to prison for 10 years
[03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:47.080]  and they actually do investigations to kind of cover things up it came out two
[03:00:47.080 --> 03:00:50.520]  weeks ago the sec as you've said for decades
[03:00:50.520 --> 03:00:54.760]  but now it's public would destroy evidence of criminal activity protected
[03:00:54.760 --> 03:00:58.760]  made off for 11 years chief amongst it but what's your view do you have any
[03:00:58.760 --> 03:01:03.000]  faith on this bob chairman i think it's uh
[03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:08.520]  another attempt to make it look like government is trying to protect the
[03:01:08.520 --> 03:01:11.880]  people uh as you say nothing will come of it
[03:01:11.880 --> 03:01:15.640]  they go through the motions and if anything the worst possible thing
[03:01:15.640 --> 03:01:19.480]  probably is there'll be a fine uh they haven't turned it over the
[03:01:19.480 --> 03:01:22.520]  justice department which means it's not a possible
[03:01:22.520 --> 03:01:28.200]  a criminal action so um as long as they stay in the sec realm
[03:01:28.200 --> 03:01:34.440]  it's the risk lap and and that's it and you know outrageous fines uh which is
[03:01:34.440 --> 03:01:39.000]  which the corporations pay probably 95 percent of the fines to
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:43.960]  individuals who work for brokerage firms or small firms and so on they never get
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:47.080]  paid let's talk to people don't know that they just
[03:01:47.080 --> 03:01:51.080]  ignore them they just don't pay them let's talk to otter and mass otter
[03:01:51.080 --> 03:01:53.240]  you're on the air thanks for holding go ahead
[03:01:53.240 --> 03:01:57.640]  hey how are you today good buddy i know you're not feeling a hundred percent so
[03:01:57.640 --> 03:02:01.400]  i think the first and most important thing that i can say is uh my prayers to
[03:02:01.400 --> 03:02:06.360]  you your family your crew we love you people you're all doing great
[03:02:06.360 --> 03:02:11.320]  prayers for ron paul russell means and for our republic it seems to me
[03:02:11.320 --> 03:02:16.280]  there's just so much you cover it all it's really tough to narrow it down and
[03:02:16.280 --> 03:02:19.960]  and pick a point so it seems like the most important topic of the day
[03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:24.440]  is the potential for impeachment the fast and furious operations the different
[03:02:24.440 --> 03:02:29.800]  playoffs that they plan um u n resolution 21 all of these different
[03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:33.720]  distractions it hurts me it actually physically hurts me to hear
[03:02:33.720 --> 03:02:37.720]  someone like that person call before and and then upset you especially when i
[03:02:37.720 --> 03:02:41.880]  know that your throat and i have respiratory issues you know that uh is
[03:02:41.880 --> 03:02:45.560]  giving you trouble and you know the sock puppet thing and you know the
[03:02:45.560 --> 03:02:49.480]  dissemination thing and you're a nice man and you don't
[03:02:49.480 --> 03:02:53.720]  ask people in advance what are you calling about and if they begin to talk
[03:02:53.720 --> 03:02:56.840]  about something well you're nice to defend me i'm just grumpy today you know
[03:02:56.840 --> 03:03:02.120]  it's it's it's like the chinese water torture where where millions of times
[03:03:02.120 --> 03:03:06.440]  they ask the same stupid thing and it's not right what they're saying
[03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:09.400]  and then you go look and they're wrong again and it's like you know they're
[03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:13.080]  like answer for this issue answer for that issue and it's never true
[03:03:13.080 --> 03:03:16.280]  and then there's no way to respond and i'm trying to just wake people up
[03:03:16.280 --> 03:03:20.600]  to deal with the major corruption and i see so many people that are awake in the
[03:03:20.600 --> 03:03:24.040]  liberty movement just chasing each other's tails and fighting but god bless
[03:03:24.040 --> 03:03:26.920]  you otter i appreciate that let's jam in lt and
[03:03:26.920 --> 03:03:32.040]  pencil thing you get a final comment from bob lt you're on the air go ahead

[03:03:45.960 --> 03:03:50.680]  comment okay real quick okay uh i think i know
[03:03:50.680 --> 03:03:57.000]  why our military has more deaths per month from suicide than combat
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:04:02.360]  we recently had a committee composed of puppets for the queen's corporations
[03:04:02.360 --> 03:04:07.160]  say the only cuts to military they would consider our cuts to soldiers
[03:04:07.160 --> 03:04:13.880]  pay health care and pensions yeah i believe that time one of the many
[03:04:13.880 --> 03:04:18.360]  dual dual citizens always found in presidential
[03:04:18.360 --> 03:04:24.120]  um boards they're almost out of time and i can't go in any more overdrive but
[03:04:24.120 --> 03:04:27.960]  make your point okay well it is very important we
[03:04:27.960 --> 03:04:31.480]  point out to our brave soldiers that they are modern day
[03:04:31.480 --> 03:04:34.840]  mercenaries for the crown just just like cash in
