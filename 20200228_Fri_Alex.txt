[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:13.000 --> 00:30.000]  front lines of the Info War.
[00:30.000 --> 00:44.000]  We have a lot of whistleblowers from the federal and state level governments coming out saying
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  that the deadliness and the spread of the coronavirus has been covered up.
[00:48.000 --> 01:03.000]  We were looking at the evidence and facts.
[01:03.000 --> 01:15.000]  It says that President Trump must lead on this coronavirus and get out ahead of it and that it could be very strong for the country and his administration did that.
[01:15.000 --> 01:27.000]  If he falters or wavers, as Mike Adams has been warning, it could hurt nationalism, his presidency in America and the world recovery.
[01:27.000 --> 01:31.000]  The Dow Jones industrial average is down a lot of 400-plus points today.
[01:31.000 --> 01:46.000]  Since the coronavirus situation kicked off, Mike Adams is going to be broadcasting the whole show today.
[01:46.000 --> 01:55.000]  Clearly, now we see this is a man-made weapon and it is targeting economies and targeting the Trump administration.
[01:55.000 --> 02:03.000]  We have seen all the communists in this country say it is super deadly and make all these announcements that make Trump bulk at it so that they can say that Trump didn't respond properly.
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.000]  That is what you have been predicting for about three weeks, Mike.
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  It looks like that is where we are going.
[02:07.000 --> 02:16.000]  In fact, Alex, I would say Info Wars has been the most accurate media source in the world on this.
[02:16.000 --> 02:17.000]  There is no question about it.
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.000]  Everything that we warned about two or three weeks ago is now being confirmed by the mainstream media.
[02:22.000 --> 02:31.000]  Based on some new information I am going to reveal here today about lab testing now being approved to begin in California and around the country next week.
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  We are going to start seeing huge increases in confirmed cases in America beginning next week.
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  I will have those bullet points and a lot more breaking news today, Alex.
[02:42.000 --> 02:43.000]  Amazing.
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  Now, there is a lot of negative things happening.
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.000]  There is also a lot of positive things happening.
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  The deep state trying to use the judiciary to persecute their political enemies.
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.000]  That is blowing up in their face.
[02:55.000 --> 02:57.000]  Other globalist operations are in big trouble.
[02:57.000 --> 03:02.000]  I ran into Eduardo Bolsonaro, the Don Jr. of Brazil.
[03:02.000 --> 03:08.000]  Brazil is a very wealthy, powerful country, most powerful in South America.
[03:08.000 --> 03:19.000]  His father is, of course, this big Trump-style maverick, God, family, country.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  He is like, Alex Jones.
[03:21.000 --> 03:23.000]  He has a bunch of cameras around him.
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  They brought me over.
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.000]  He said, did you know that my father, myself, tried to get in touch with you two years before he ran?
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  We are inspired by you.
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  I said, well, I am small operation.
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  He said, no, you are not small.
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  I said, sorry, we missed your e-mails.
[03:44.000 --> 03:50.000]  I remember my producer, who speaks Spanish at the time, he had to go and take care of his dad.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  He had to leave us.
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.000]  Nico, I remember him saying, hey, there is a political group.
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.000]  They are nationalists.
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000]  They really like you.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  They want you to come speak in Brazil.
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.000]  I remember saying, yeah, maybe let's get them on, but I never did it.
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  I should have gotten Bolsonaro on before.
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  Maybe they would have used that against him.
[04:07.000 --> 04:17.000]  But to face-to-face be there, and Bolsonaro's famous son, Don Jr., of South America, is sitting there telling me,
[04:17.000 --> 04:18.000]  you inspired us.
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.000]  You helped us do this.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  You helped us understand the whole paradigm.
[04:22.000 --> 04:28.000]  That is the same thing Nigel Farage said on my show many times, is that UKIP was going nowhere,
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  but M4s had such a big audience that suddenly they would knock on doors,
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  and people knew him from my show.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  He used to come on like every month.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  But listen, I get it.
[04:40.000 --> 04:41.000]  He gets attacked now if we're coming on.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  So, Farage doesn't really come on.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  I could probably get him to if I wanted to.
[04:45.000 --> 04:51.000]  But the point is, is that M4 wars in this audience funded this operation and supported it.
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.000]  Not just relaunch America, but 1776 worldwide.
[04:54.000 --> 04:55.000]  We'll be right back.
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[04:56.000 --> 04:57.000]  Mike Adams.
[04:57.000 --> 04:58.000]  Thank you.
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.000]  Thank you.
[05:57.000 --> 06:10.680]  From the Frontlines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:10.680 --> 06:17.720]  We are live on this Friday mobile transmission.
[06:17.720 --> 06:23.320]  I come to you from Washington, D.C., a few miles away from National Harbor, where they
[06:23.320 --> 06:25.920]  are having the CPAC event.
[06:25.920 --> 06:28.280]  President Trump will be speaking at tomorrow.
[06:28.280 --> 06:34.440]  We're going to have our reporters, Owen Schreuer, Savannah Hernandez, Harrison Smith, and others
[06:34.440 --> 06:38.440]  here kicking ass tomorrow with live feeds throughout the day.
[06:38.440 --> 06:42.040]  I want to just add that our skeleton crew, we're trying to hire more people, trying
[06:42.040 --> 06:49.560]  to expand producers, board-op, camera operators, has been working 17, 18 hours a day, bringing
[06:49.560 --> 06:54.640]  you live coverage at night of the different events we've been putting on, so I'm not
[06:54.640 --> 07:01.640]  as very thankful to the crew here in D.C. and Maryland, but the crew back at home, they
[07:01.640 --> 07:05.800]  really don't get the recognition that they deserve.
[07:05.800 --> 07:10.200]  This is all fog of war stuff, so it's very, very stressful by salute the crew in Austin
[07:10.200 --> 07:14.760]  and the crew here for just doing a kick-ass job and really being amazing people that I'm
[07:14.760 --> 07:20.360]  humbled and honored to know, and then I'm even guilty because I'm quite a bit of a
[07:20.360 --> 07:21.360]  jerk behind the scenes.
[07:21.360 --> 07:26.280]  There's a lot of fake news out there about me, don't wear swastikas shoes and I don't
[07:26.280 --> 07:32.440]  hit on male employees, but I do scream at people sometimes for basically no reason because
[07:32.440 --> 07:38.880]  I'm stressed out, and I'm not complaining, I'm not a victim, and people understand that
[07:38.880 --> 07:42.120]  I'm pushing with everything I've got, and I have plenty of energy.
[07:42.120 --> 07:43.120]  I feel great.
[07:43.120 --> 07:49.760]  The problem is, is that I need a vacation because we all need a vacation, though.
[07:49.760 --> 07:54.040]  The stress level on this planet is completely out of control because we're at a crossroads
[07:54.040 --> 07:57.880]  about the future of humanity, where we're going to go, so let me tell you what's coming
[07:57.880 --> 07:58.880]  up today.
[07:58.880 --> 08:05.320]  Mike Adams, who has been just absolutely at the very tip, tip, tip of the spear, accurately,
[08:05.320 --> 08:11.280]  conscientiously as an engineer, a scientist, and a major lab owner with all of his sources
[08:11.280 --> 08:16.320]  in China, his wife's an American, but she's from Taiwan, she has businesses in Hong Kong
[08:16.320 --> 08:22.440]  and Taiwan, giving you what's in the Chinese and Hong Kong and Taiwanese news weeks before
[08:22.440 --> 08:26.520]  it's here, and that's what's frustrating is, it's right there that major universities
[08:26.520 --> 08:30.080]  in Hong Kong and Taiwan three weeks ago said it's man-made and killing high numbers of
[08:30.080 --> 08:34.600]  people and you just never saw it here, or an Indian university came out and said that
[08:34.600 --> 08:39.040]  four weeks ago and they got threatened, so they just said, well, we're withdrawing the
[08:39.040 --> 08:44.040]  paper, we're not saying it's wrong, the virus is completely engineered, then we learned
[08:44.040 --> 08:48.160]  from Dr. Francis Boyle, the author of the U.S. Biological Weapons Law and Global Treaty,
[08:48.160 --> 08:52.440]  top expert in law and in the science, saying they know it's man-made and even found the
[08:52.440 --> 09:01.680]  articles in 2015 in Science Journal saying, do not sell this weird chimera made out of
[09:01.680 --> 09:12.520]  bats and other creature's pneumonia with HIV, so this is ridiculous smoking gun, so why
[09:12.520 --> 09:17.640]  did Obama sell it to the Chai Khoms, so that when it got released, maybe by a third party,
[09:17.640 --> 09:23.120]  maybe by the Muslim Brotherhood, like Specter or the Globalist, I mean, or the Chai Khoms,
[09:23.120 --> 09:25.440]  I don't think we know who released it.
[09:25.440 --> 09:31.880]  We've posited that, well, probably their bad practices, their level four facility, scavengers
[09:31.880 --> 09:37.280]  getting the rubber gloves, maybe that's how it happened, it is right down the street from
[09:37.280 --> 09:40.960]  this fish market that has all these other weird animals in it, but Mike Adams has got
[09:40.960 --> 09:48.040]  huge breaking news on multiple fronts, Papua Canada has come out, big article on InfoWars.com,
[09:48.040 --> 09:55.120]  and he said, President Trump must lead on this, it's his job, and if he gets out ahead
[09:55.120 --> 10:00.680]  of it, which he still has time to do, he will not be damaged, and the American recovery
[10:00.680 --> 10:05.800]  may not be damaged by this, but if he doesn't lead on this and give direction because there
[10:05.800 --> 10:10.320]  is a lot of concern, people gut level know something's going on here because of the
[10:10.320 --> 10:13.200]  uncertainty, it's going to tank the stock market.
[10:13.200 --> 10:18.840]  See, Trump thinks ignoring this is going to just have it blow over, or have people stay
[10:18.840 --> 10:19.840]  on the stock market.
[10:19.840 --> 10:24.000]  We have a 14, almost 50% drop the stock market in the last couple of weeks, 400 points down
[10:24.000 --> 10:25.840]  today, last time I checked.
[10:25.840 --> 10:28.880]  Mike Adams, there's a lot happening here.
[10:28.880 --> 10:31.920]  What do you think is the number one issue or new development because there's so many?
[10:31.920 --> 10:35.200]  Well, yeah, this show is going to be packed.
[10:35.200 --> 10:40.200]  So first of all, yesterday we had confirmed in California a woman now critically ill in
[10:40.200 --> 10:45.900]  Solano County, who had gone through two hospitals and potentially exposed dozens of hospital
[10:45.900 --> 10:47.160]  staffers to this virus.
[10:47.160 --> 10:48.920]  She's now confirmed infected.
[10:48.920 --> 10:52.880]  And it turns out that I don't even think they have adequate quarantine of the hospital
[10:52.880 --> 10:53.880]  staff now.
[10:53.880 --> 10:54.880]  There's the officials.
[10:54.880 --> 11:00.320]  I mean, we've got a press release here from UC Davis Health, and they say the CDC prohibited
[11:00.320 --> 11:03.660]  us essentially from testing this woman for 11 days.
[11:03.660 --> 11:09.240]  So the CDC, this is actually Alex, this is the bombshell news, the CDC set a trap for
[11:09.240 --> 11:15.640]  President Trump by prohibiting testing nationwide for the last three to four weeks while this
[11:15.640 --> 11:20.000]  thing spread while this woman, just one we know of in California.
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.200]  And by the way, Solano County is where Travis Air Force Base is located.
[11:24.200 --> 11:25.720]  And that let's just stop right there.
[11:25.720 --> 11:31.760]  We need to put that live headline out for the show right now needs to be confirmed CDC set
[11:31.760 --> 11:35.760]  trap with coronavirus allowing a month of incubation.
[11:35.760 --> 11:36.760]  That's right.
[11:36.760 --> 11:41.760]  And then they just noticed the Chai comms lockdown, Italy lockdown, South Korea lockdown, Japan
[11:41.760 --> 11:44.160]  lockdown weeks ago.
[11:44.160 --> 11:49.760]  But we were told by the UN on the left, keep your borders open, bring bring people in.
[11:49.760 --> 11:51.040]  How dare you be racist?
[11:51.040 --> 11:56.120]  Oh, no, but infected people on airplanes with other US citizens that aren't infected, something
[11:56.120 --> 11:59.280]  on a 12 monkeys textbook, how you would spread this.
[11:59.280 --> 12:03.240]  And then now they're starting to blame Trump saying it looks like it's bad.
[12:03.240 --> 12:07.520]  Why didn't you act early enough when exactly the deep state advised him?
[12:07.520 --> 12:11.240]  He would never think that scientists would be part of that when they, of course, we
[12:11.240 --> 12:14.240]  know are the deepest of the deep state.
[12:14.240 --> 12:18.240]  It's insane, Alex, that America were supposed to be technologically advanced in the realm
[12:18.240 --> 12:19.760]  of medicine.
[12:19.760 --> 12:24.400]  And yet somehow every other country in the world contests for this, but not America.
[12:24.400 --> 12:29.560]  And I've been saying here on your show for weeks that there's basically zero testing
[12:29.560 --> 12:31.440]  happening in America or near zero.
[12:31.440 --> 12:32.440]  The CDC.
[12:32.440 --> 12:33.440]  Now they confirm.
[12:33.440 --> 12:35.240]  I mean, I'm going to use that a month ago.
[12:35.240 --> 12:36.240]  Yeah.
[12:36.240 --> 12:40.680]  And yesterday, Governor Newsom from California said, we only have a few hundred test kits
[12:40.680 --> 12:42.840]  for the entire state of California.
[12:42.840 --> 12:46.880]  The CDC has been publishing the number every day and I checked this morning.
[12:46.880 --> 12:52.240]  It's only 445 people have been tested nationwide from day one.
[12:52.240 --> 12:56.440]  And Alex, there's something people's brains can't grasp this.
[12:56.440 --> 13:01.280]  When I tell them the CDC says 445 people tested, period.
[13:01.280 --> 13:04.760]  You know, the answer I get is, why are you spreading fear?
[13:04.760 --> 13:07.320]  You know, it's like, no, no, I'm, I'm deciding the CDC.
[13:07.320 --> 13:08.480]  What are you talking about?
[13:08.480 --> 13:09.600]  Don't you get it?
[13:09.600 --> 13:11.160]  There's no testing in America.
[13:11.160 --> 13:15.120]  So how can we detect an outbreak if there's no testing for the virus?
[13:15.120 --> 13:18.520]  Well, Alex, that testing begins now on Monday.
[13:18.520 --> 13:19.520]  The CDC has.
[13:19.520 --> 13:23.760]  All that in the news yesterday that they're now going, oh, now we're going to begin testing.
[13:23.760 --> 13:28.360]  And remember a month ago was being reported that the code of the virus wasn't being sent
[13:28.360 --> 13:32.040]  out to these labs that can already do the testing and they don't know why the code wasn't
[13:32.040 --> 13:33.040]  being sent to them.
[13:33.040 --> 13:36.440]  So clearly they wanted America to be caught flat footed here.
[13:36.440 --> 13:37.720]  Mike, why do you think that is?
[13:37.720 --> 13:41.920]  Well, I believe the CDC has, again, set up Trump for this.
[13:41.920 --> 13:42.920]  They're going to blame Trump.
[13:42.920 --> 13:44.680]  You already see the narrative happening.
[13:44.680 --> 13:48.920]  And sadly, so far, I've been a little bit critical of the president in his handling
[13:48.920 --> 13:50.800]  of this just because he needs to get out in front of it.
[13:50.800 --> 13:55.240]  And this is, as Pat Buchanan argued, this is a time for Trump to show real leadership
[13:55.240 --> 14:01.560]  and also to argue about the dangers of globalism and why we need to protect America's industries.
[14:01.560 --> 14:04.520]  We need a supply chain here in America.
[14:04.520 --> 14:06.440]  Protectionism would save us now.
[14:06.440 --> 14:12.160]  It would save our stock market now if we had real protectionism and actual domestic redundancies.
[14:12.160 --> 14:13.160]  Exactly.
[14:13.160 --> 14:14.160]  Globalism allowed this to happen.
[14:14.160 --> 14:18.840]  America is selling this China, China being opened to us, being able to flood us with
[14:18.840 --> 14:19.840]  all this.
[14:19.840 --> 14:24.160]  This is the definition of globalism, but instead, the globalists are saying they're going to
[14:24.160 --> 14:29.160]  use the global crisis to crush nationalists and say that, oh, the globe came together
[14:29.160 --> 14:33.760]  to stop it, but the nationalist Trump wasn't part of that, so he allowed it to get really
[14:33.760 --> 14:34.760]  bad.
[14:34.760 --> 14:40.240]  Now, the global supply line, single source supply chains from China, this is what is
[14:40.240 --> 14:44.400]  going to cause a wave of bankruptcies across America.
[14:44.400 --> 14:46.920]  And you and I are already seeing it in the supply chains.
[14:46.920 --> 14:48.560]  The supply lines are cratering.
[14:48.560 --> 14:51.760]  You're seeing a supply chain armageddon unfolding right now.
[14:51.760 --> 14:55.680]  And I got to say, Alex, it doesn't matter how much money the Federal Reserve prints,
[14:55.680 --> 15:00.040]  you cannot create liquidity to rebuild a supply chain that's cratering.
[15:00.040 --> 15:01.040]  It does not work.
[15:01.040 --> 15:04.600]  It just, the supply chain is gone.
[15:04.600 --> 15:08.760]  And by the way, Mike, for those that don't know, let's do the next segment on supply
[15:08.760 --> 15:11.920]  chains because you're an engineer and you've got a big company and you've got a lot of
[15:11.920 --> 15:13.600]  products, so do I.
[15:13.600 --> 15:18.240]  People don't understand who aren't in that, that it takes years to build up a supply chain,
[15:18.240 --> 15:23.000]  vendors, it takes years to have credit, and then once those things are broken down and
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.840]  most people are dependent on China, you and I are not, then that will destroy all these
[15:26.840 --> 15:31.840]  companies and connections and supply chains, leaving us completely dependent.
[15:31.840 --> 15:34.160]  We always said, why are we so dependent on China?
[15:34.160 --> 15:35.960]  China is a ghost town in most places.
[15:35.960 --> 15:38.040]  Your economy is totally in free fall.
[15:38.040 --> 15:40.880]  How is that going to affect those of us around the world?
[15:40.880 --> 15:47.520]  We aren't invested in China, but still, everybody else around us is, it is a giant chain reaction
[15:47.520 --> 15:53.160]  and that's why the stock market is down 14, almost 15%, 100 points today.
[15:53.160 --> 15:57.760]  From thought by not talking about this, you would create confidence, it did the opposite.
[15:57.760 --> 16:01.440]  I'm here with Scott Yousiam, founder of OMGTax.
[16:01.440 --> 16:06.200]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[16:06.200 --> 16:11.600]  My team of lawyers, enrolled agents, and licensed tax experts remove wage garnish fans, sometimes
[16:11.600 --> 16:12.600]  in the same day.
[16:12.600 --> 16:16.160]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what
[16:16.160 --> 16:18.120]  is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:18.120 --> 16:20.400]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[16:20.400 --> 16:21.960]  Oh, can I ever?
[16:21.960 --> 16:27.200]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[16:27.200 --> 16:28.200]  Guess what?
[16:28.200 --> 16:32.880]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[16:32.880 --> 16:38.000]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot
[16:38.000 --> 16:43.520]  less, call OMGTax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.
[16:43.520 --> 16:57.280]  Call 800-486-8112-800-486-8112-800-486-8112- that's 800-486-8112.
[16:57.280 --> 17:01.840]  If you are trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[17:01.840 --> 17:03.760]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[17:03.760 --> 17:05.440]  I had a problem like you once.
[17:05.440 --> 17:10.920]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[17:10.920 --> 17:12.040]  my life.
[17:12.040 --> 17:17.280]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[17:17.280 --> 17:22.480]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[17:22.480 --> 17:25.600]  you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[17:25.600 --> 17:30.320]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[17:30.320 --> 17:32.640]  and totally change your life.
[17:32.640 --> 17:37.880]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[17:37.880 --> 17:41.120]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[17:41.120 --> 17:42.120]  Get clean.
[17:42.120 --> 17:59.480]  Call now and learn more 800-506-6740-800-506-6740, that's 800-506-6740.
[17:59.480 --> 18:06.880]  I spend a lot of time reminding the M4s, the family of listeners and viewers that without
[18:06.880 --> 18:10.400]  you we won't be on the air and I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[18:10.400 --> 18:14.520]  I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing
[18:14.520 --> 18:17.680]  the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres.
[18:17.680 --> 18:23.560]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are
[18:23.560 --> 18:25.160]  really amazing.
[18:25.160 --> 18:28.400]  You've got that pledge from me but you've seen the third-party test out there, the air
[18:28.400 --> 18:30.320]  filtration, the water filtration.
[18:30.320 --> 18:35.360]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there and you can't fund
[18:35.360 --> 18:40.000]  an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.880]  So it's not a burden to support InfoWars.
[18:43.880 --> 18:50.960]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes
[18:50.960 --> 18:54.560]  your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[18:54.560 --> 18:58.520]  So visit InfoWarsStore.com today.
[18:58.520 --> 19:04.440]  I also want to say that I'm happy to be helping out with an enterprise that is supported by
[19:04.440 --> 19:09.520]  all the work to help people be prepared and instead of just giving in to sickness care,
[19:09.520 --> 19:13.160]  they care of their health, they care of their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater
[19:13.160 --> 19:18.040]  vitality and I say that from personal experience because I know that the products that are
[19:18.040 --> 19:22.760]  being offered here, I've tried them and I use them every day and that power pack that
[19:22.760 --> 19:28.240]  they have, the AMPM power pack, well I wouldn't be so energetic this morning except that I
[19:28.240 --> 19:30.960]  have been on a regular customer in that regard.
[19:30.960 --> 19:34.560]  I just wanted to start out by saying that because I think it's important to remember
[19:34.560 --> 19:38.680]  that beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to think
[19:38.680 --> 19:43.640]  about these great events in the world, one of the priorities has to be to take care of
[19:43.640 --> 19:50.200]  yourself remembering that our lives are a gift from God that he intends us to use for
[19:50.200 --> 19:54.920]  good purpose for our families and for our communities and right now, folks who are willing
[19:54.920 --> 20:22.920]  to think like we do are critical to the future of America.
[20:25.920 --> 20:33.040]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[20:33.040 --> 20:36.280]  And Mike Adams, doing a great job there in the AGX.
[20:36.280 --> 20:38.560]  I am Alex Jones here in UNC.
[20:38.560 --> 20:39.800]  I am coming back tonight.
[20:39.800 --> 20:45.200]  The crew is doing a fabulous job and I'm going to stay here for President Trump's statements
[20:45.200 --> 20:47.200]  tomorrow.
[20:47.200 --> 20:52.480]  So look for all those live feeds at newswords.com and band.video and please never forget sharing
[20:52.480 --> 20:55.800]  those links is a revolutionary act.
[20:55.800 --> 21:04.080]  That's why five weeks ago, before the coronavirus even got hyped up, we were hit with daily
[21:04.080 --> 21:09.800]  denial of service attacks and other sophisticated attacks trying to break into everything.
[21:09.800 --> 21:13.720]  And Mike Adams is calling me up saying we're under unprecedented attack.
[21:13.720 --> 21:18.000]  He had bizarre fake bankruptcy filings on lawsuits.
[21:18.000 --> 21:25.720]  He's not even named him in weird Obama circuit courts, Ninth Circuit in San Francisco.
[21:25.720 --> 21:28.360]  And his own law firms are like, we've never seen this.
[21:28.360 --> 21:29.360]  This is insane.
[21:29.360 --> 21:34.520]  And then it turned out that it was happening to thousands of other alternative news sites
[21:34.520 --> 21:36.440]  ahead of whatever was about to happen.
[21:36.440 --> 21:42.360]  So that made us kind of go, oh, coronavirus is probably really important because they're
[21:42.360 --> 21:44.480]  not just hammering info wars.
[21:44.480 --> 21:51.320]  It's all Merkola and other respected folks that'll actually do an analysis and tell you
[21:51.320 --> 21:52.820]  what's going on.
[21:52.820 --> 21:54.320]  And then it just got crazier.
[21:54.320 --> 22:01.680]  And then four weeks ago, the Indian top universities, Kansom goes, it's closed case, open and shut,
[22:01.680 --> 22:02.680]  manmade.
[22:02.680 --> 22:07.560]  And then now we're watching, you can and saying, listen, you're missing an opportunity, Trump.
[22:07.560 --> 22:08.880]  This exposes open borders.
[22:08.880 --> 22:14.640]  It exposes being relying on communist China and these long supply chains just on time
[22:14.640 --> 22:15.800]  delivery.
[22:15.800 --> 22:19.880]  And it shows how open borders are bad, but you've got to get the bulls by the horn,
[22:19.880 --> 22:25.520]  do the right thing and not let a terrible crisis go to waste to make things better out
[22:25.520 --> 22:26.520]  of the crisis.
[22:26.520 --> 22:27.800]  Not a ramen manual.
[22:27.800 --> 22:29.120]  Don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[22:29.120 --> 22:33.600]  Don't let terrible tragedies just break our backs, make us stronger.
[22:33.600 --> 22:35.040]  That is my philosophy.
[22:35.040 --> 22:42.320]  So Mike, let's next segment get in, you take your time, I'll try to not talk as much, lay
[22:42.320 --> 22:46.960]  out how this is a weapon against the nation state and the globalists are even on MSNBC
[22:46.960 --> 22:52.840]  and CNN saying they hope the economy going down hurts Trump, helps Bolsonaro and hurts
[22:52.840 --> 22:53.840]  other people.
[22:53.840 --> 22:55.960]  But let's briefly talk about supply chain.
[22:55.960 --> 22:59.600]  I'm going to make an announcement here that's very important.
[22:59.600 --> 23:04.080]  When I get back to town tonight, I'm going to go into work tomorrow for most of the day
[23:04.080 --> 23:07.600]  and I'm going to research the information we already have, but I'm going to double check
[23:07.600 --> 23:08.880]  it all.
[23:08.880 --> 23:13.200]  But obviously, I told my patron supply, the biggest food supplier in the country, four
[23:13.200 --> 23:17.520]  weeks ago when this got big, I said, you need to keep mine, spend all the money coming in,
[23:17.520 --> 23:18.520]  going out.
[23:18.520 --> 23:19.520]  I believe this is huge.
[23:19.520 --> 23:20.520]  They said, no, we agree.
[23:20.520 --> 23:25.040]  But I also said, I'm going to be honest, I've had a lot of bad experience with our food
[23:25.040 --> 23:28.880]  companies other than you as sponsors and in person, but I am going to reach out because
[23:28.880 --> 23:30.000]  I got to feel this is going to be huge.
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.440]  I'm going to reach out to other ones in case you can't hear.
[23:32.440 --> 23:34.640]  They said, fine, we totally get it.
[23:34.640 --> 23:37.200]  We ordered food from multiple big names.
[23:37.200 --> 23:38.200]  Never came.
[23:38.200 --> 23:39.200]  They told us seven days.
[23:39.200 --> 23:40.200]  One place told us 10 days.
[23:40.200 --> 23:41.200]  Never.
[23:41.200 --> 23:42.200]  Four weeks later.
[23:42.200 --> 23:45.080]  I talked to Matt Redhawk, the folks at my pet review, they did the same thing.
[23:45.080 --> 23:48.720]  At the big top names, the other big talk show hosts have on.
[23:48.720 --> 23:51.760]  And I'm not here attacking the competition.
[23:51.760 --> 23:52.760]  This is true.
[23:52.760 --> 23:53.760]  Scouts honor.
[23:53.760 --> 23:54.880]  This is happening.
[23:54.880 --> 23:59.840]  And it bums me out that there are groups out there that go, well, if we tell you seven
[23:59.840 --> 24:04.280]  to 10 days and Jones tells you six weeks now, you'll come to us.
[24:04.280 --> 24:05.920]  But with us, it's really six weeks.
[24:05.920 --> 24:09.440]  With them, who the hell knows what's even going on?
[24:09.440 --> 24:13.520]  This is quality, high quality food at a very reasonable price.
[24:13.520 --> 24:18.000]  I do a nexus point who delivers whose high quality and who is very inexpensive.
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.800]  You can pay four or five times more and get stuff that's even better because Gore makes
[24:20.800 --> 24:21.800]  stuff out there.
[24:21.800 --> 24:26.320]  But for the point of super high quality with a good price, it's right, you know, X marks
[24:26.320 --> 24:29.560]  the spot where those two graphs come together.
[24:29.560 --> 24:33.600]  So I told you yesterday, it's five weeks during the show.
[24:33.600 --> 24:37.560]  They're telling me in the next few days, if you go to six to eight weeks, I got a call
[24:37.560 --> 24:38.560]  last night.
[24:38.560 --> 24:41.120]  They said, you got to change the terms of service six to eight weeks.
[24:41.120 --> 24:44.400]  And I talked for hours last night, hours this morning.
[24:44.400 --> 24:47.360]  And they said, look, most stuff, it's still four to five weeks.
[24:47.360 --> 24:50.520]  But we're going to, we're going to under promise over deliver.
[24:50.520 --> 24:52.600]  We don't make people angry.
[24:52.600 --> 24:57.240]  And they said, it's depending on what they order, some things are six, eight weeks.
[24:57.240 --> 24:59.920]  And it's too complex to list what those are.
[24:59.920 --> 25:02.720]  So we're now saying six to eight weeks.
[25:02.720 --> 25:06.560]  As of this morning, it's really five weeks, but you have to understand they've already
[25:06.560 --> 25:13.120]  had to emergency put everything they've got and even leverage more into opening and firing
[25:13.120 --> 25:20.440]  up with already big operating FDA approved systems where they have you inspectors in
[25:20.440 --> 25:21.440]  the plants.
[25:21.440 --> 25:23.680]  Three, it was an extra one last week.
[25:23.680 --> 25:29.200]  Now they're firing up three more and they said, unless it's, you know, 10 times this
[25:29.200 --> 25:34.280]  or something, they are not going to have to go past six to eight weeks now.
[25:34.280 --> 25:35.520]  But that's real world.
[25:35.520 --> 25:37.080]  That's real supply chain.
[25:37.080 --> 25:41.520]  When you're getting a hundred, 200 times record orders and you're already positioned for that
[25:41.520 --> 25:46.200]  and then overpowers you and you know, people are out there lying everywhere just saying,
[25:46.200 --> 25:48.120]  oh yeah, they don't even have food.
[25:48.120 --> 25:49.960]  They're just taking your money.
[25:49.960 --> 25:51.560]  And I'm going to expose these groups.
[25:51.560 --> 25:54.480]  I want them to know because people need sortable food.
[25:54.480 --> 25:56.320]  This type of activity is disgusting.
[25:56.320 --> 26:02.120]  So I want those groups to know at the end of this and like Buchanan says, this may last
[26:02.120 --> 26:03.920]  a month, six months.
[26:03.920 --> 26:07.800]  As a public service, we're going to expose what the other groups have done because it's
[26:07.800 --> 26:11.160]  wrong and we're not going to let them give legitimate companies a bad name.
[26:11.160 --> 26:16.360]  But if you want to get your orders in, I would tell you that right now it's five, six weeks.
[26:16.360 --> 26:18.280]  You say six to eight just to be safe.
[26:18.280 --> 26:22.800]  They'll never really go past eight unless Armageddon, but that's what's happened.
[26:22.800 --> 26:24.720]  And that's what supply chains are like.
[26:24.720 --> 26:26.160]  That's what real world is like.
[26:26.160 --> 26:27.160]  Mike Adams.
[26:27.160 --> 26:31.240]  Well, we have breaking news from the Wall Street Journal today that's relevant to all
[26:31.240 --> 26:32.240]  of this.
[26:32.240 --> 26:36.200]  According to the WSJ, there's a whistleblower so I hate it that the fact they're using that
[26:36.200 --> 26:41.840]  term because now it makes it political says that federal employees who monitored the Travis
[26:41.840 --> 26:47.320]  Air Force Base Quarantine Center did not use personal protective equipment appropriately.
[26:47.320 --> 26:51.400]  And then afterwards, they were not tested for the virus, these employees.
[26:51.400 --> 26:56.920]  And then they left California quarantine sites on commercial air flights all across America.
[26:56.920 --> 27:02.160]  So this case that we have in Solano County, this woman who's critically ill, who exposed
[27:02.160 --> 27:05.160]  potentially dozens of hospital frontline workers.
[27:05.160 --> 27:09.800]  I bet you that she's somehow connected to Travis Air Force Base.
[27:09.800 --> 27:14.320]  I think the Travis Air Force Base is leaking the virus.
[27:14.320 --> 27:17.480]  In fact, that's what this whistleblower is all about here, going to the WSJ.
[27:17.480 --> 27:20.240]  Now, some people say this is just an effort to try to hurt Trump.
[27:20.240 --> 27:22.440]  We have to always consider that possibility.
[27:22.440 --> 27:25.880]  Maybe it is, but the virus doesn't play politics.
[27:25.880 --> 27:28.160]  You better be right about this.
[27:28.160 --> 27:30.520]  I mean, the virus doesn't care who's in the White House.
[27:30.520 --> 27:32.000]  The virus just keeps replicating.
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.120]  And if you don't have protective equipment and you're letting these people fly all over
[27:35.120 --> 27:40.320]  the country, probably right now, Alex, by my estimation, I can't prove it.
[27:40.320 --> 27:43.680]  I think there are over 4,000 infections in America right now.
[27:43.680 --> 27:47.560]  And next week, we will begin to see labs confirming some of these infections.
[27:47.560 --> 27:52.600]  I expect to see tens and dozens of confirmations next week, followed by hundreds in the weeks
[27:52.600 --> 27:53.600]  following.
[27:53.600 --> 27:57.640]  And by the way, Mike, you've been dead on before with the modeling.
[27:57.640 --> 28:01.040]  How were you able to model what was happening in China, South Korea, Japan?
[28:01.040 --> 28:02.520]  Because that's turned out to be accurate.
[28:02.520 --> 28:07.480]  Well, Alex, because I can do math, basically, you know, I understand exponential growth.
[28:07.480 --> 28:10.320]  And so the average person today, they say, well, this is no big deal because they're
[28:10.320 --> 28:14.080]  looking at a point on a chart, they're saying, oh, it's only 15 infections.
[28:14.080 --> 28:19.040]  I see the point and I see the projection based on the R not value of where that goes exponentially.
[28:19.040 --> 28:23.920]  See, I see the whole line in my mind when I'm doing the math on this.
[28:23.920 --> 28:28.040]  Plus we know they're covering up the real numbers by not having tested, which he is.
[28:28.040 --> 28:29.040]  Exactly.
[28:29.040 --> 28:30.040]  Not even defending Trump.
[28:30.040 --> 28:31.040]  It doesn't blame Trump.
[28:31.040 --> 28:33.760]  If Deep State covered this up from him, they are to blame.
[28:33.760 --> 28:36.760]  But I've told Trump, they keep taking shots at you.
[28:36.760 --> 28:38.240]  We never take out the Deep State.
[28:38.240 --> 28:39.440]  They're going to launch another attack.
[28:39.440 --> 28:40.440]  Yes.
[28:40.440 --> 28:42.200]  And at that point, it becomes dereliction of duty.
[28:42.200 --> 28:44.200]  So Trump is beginning to become responsible.
[28:44.200 --> 28:45.720]  It doesn't mean we're going to blame him.
[28:45.720 --> 28:47.200]  We're going to blame those that did it.
[28:47.200 --> 28:50.720]  But how long do we sit there while he leaves them in place doing this?
[28:50.720 --> 28:52.120]  I've been asking for months.
[28:52.120 --> 28:53.120]  What's their next attack?
[28:53.120 --> 28:54.120]  What's their next attack?
[28:54.120 --> 28:56.440]  Well, now we know, folks, this is man made.
[28:56.440 --> 28:58.440]  Stay with us.

[29:59.160 --> 30:01.880]  There can no longer be any doubt.
[30:01.880 --> 30:07.800]  This coronavirus is serious on multiple levels, it's very communicable, it spreads very,
[30:07.800 --> 30:13.160]  very fast, it is killing a lot of people and the Chinese Communist government has covered
[30:13.160 --> 30:18.440]  up just how bad it is and the Lighthouse is now openly challenging them, show our Trump's
[30:18.440 --> 30:21.640]  top scientist and so is Senator Cotton.
[30:21.640 --> 30:25.520]  My friends, now is the time to get prepared.
[30:25.520 --> 30:30.520]  2020 is not a year to play games with, the globalists are trying to create economic
[30:30.520 --> 30:32.400]  collapse, race riots.
[30:32.400 --> 30:35.400]  We don't know how bad this virus is going to get here.
[30:35.400 --> 30:41.880]  That's why listeners to M4 Wars need to be prepared and m4warstore.com has the products

[31:07.000 --> 31:10.440]  toxins weigh you down with your plenty of hydration, prayer and meditation has been

[31:29.440 --> 31:33.200]  A virus, we're almost sold out of the one ounce spray bottles that will be sold out
[31:33.200 --> 31:36.640]  a couple days and we're about a week and a half or so of the super silver three ounce

[31:50.800 --> 31:52.720]  best stuff and there's a lot of patriots.
[31:52.720 --> 31:56.160]  There's not just bad guys coming after us, there's the flip side of all the good guys
[31:56.160 --> 31:59.880]  and good gals, it's very exciting.
[31:59.880 --> 32:04.480]  We know that the globalists are in trouble, humanity's waking up to their tyranny, how
[32:04.480 --> 32:09.400]  they run their scams, their Ponzi schemes, how they're building a post human world, but
[32:09.400 --> 32:14.440]  we know they're going to strike back and the U.N. has said that they're going to absolutely
[32:14.440 --> 32:20.400]  implode third world countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes
[32:20.400 --> 32:25.600]  to come in and overwhelm the West and collapse our social services in a giant clowered and
[32:25.600 --> 32:26.840]  pivot program.
[32:26.840 --> 32:32.600]  The U.N. also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government
[32:32.600 --> 32:34.840]  inner coronavirus.
[32:34.840 --> 32:40.520]  This is a critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed and to be spreading
[32:40.520 --> 32:45.440]  the word because people are waking up like never before, but this fight against tyranny
[32:45.440 --> 32:51.280]  is neck and neck so spread the word about band.video and infullwars.com forward slash
[32:51.280 --> 32:52.280]  show.
[32:52.280 --> 33:02.440]  That is so important, you are at the center of the resistance, you are our only hope.
[33:02.440 --> 33:20.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:20.640 --> 33:48.640]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:48.640 --> 33:55.680]  I'm not a violent person, but I know there's Satanists, I know there's devil worshipers
[33:55.680 --> 34:01.240]  and if I saw a pit bull attacking a three-year-old kid, I would kill that dog, not against dogs
[34:01.240 --> 34:02.240]  in general.
[34:02.240 --> 34:09.280]  Dogs are good, but that dog is out of control and I want to kill it and you know what, I've
[34:09.280 --> 34:17.040]  got the strength to do it and I have nightmares about dying not because I'm afraid to die,
[34:17.040 --> 34:22.240]  I actually want to be with God, not afraid of dying, but not of working hard enough
[34:22.240 --> 34:28.200]  while I'm alive to protect me because we can do things today that even after we're gone
[34:28.200 --> 34:33.800]  builds a wall against this evil and folks think caring about evil and wanting to fight
[34:33.800 --> 34:34.800]  it is a weakness.
[34:34.800 --> 34:39.560]  They think being sociopathic, corporations teach to be so cutthroat that that's how
[34:39.560 --> 34:40.560]  you get ahead.
[34:40.560 --> 34:46.120]  Well, not when you destroy the whole civilization, that's not true.
[34:46.120 --> 34:53.440]  So when I get up here and I talk about this virus, it's because from a gut level I feel
[34:53.440 --> 34:55.880]  concerned.
[34:55.880 --> 35:00.120]  We told you 10 years ago, here on here, Michael's the guest then, SARS is overblown, it's a
[35:00.120 --> 35:05.000]  big police state, quarantine drill.
[35:05.000 --> 35:11.040]  This one's manmade and this one has teeth and they've covered it up and they've clearly
[35:11.040 --> 35:17.400]  set the U.S. up to tell Trump it's no problem so that when it becomes a problem, they can
[35:17.400 --> 35:21.280]  blame him and Pat Buchanan has raised the alarm that many, many others are.
[35:21.280 --> 35:25.480]  So I kept asking a few months ago, is this whole impeachment thing is going to fail?
[35:25.480 --> 35:27.800]  When it fails, what do they do next?
[35:27.800 --> 35:33.440]  I even said he can on a collapse, maybe from a bio weapon, a war, we're on record saying
[35:33.440 --> 35:38.800]  that because this is easy to figure out and I told Trump, I said they're not going to
[35:38.800 --> 35:42.840]  stop buddy and that's why you've got to make a move against the deep state, even though
[35:42.840 --> 35:43.840]  that's dangerous as well.
[35:43.840 --> 35:48.800]  He just wants to beat them with success and the economy and have them be exposed as much
[35:48.800 --> 35:55.600]  idiots but they're still dug in and they're still going to continue to launch attacks.
[35:55.600 --> 35:58.920]  So I want my condoms to get into the trap and the news that clearly is closing around
[35:58.920 --> 36:04.720]  America's neck and again, we said this a month ago, MSNBC CNN the last week have all been
[36:04.720 --> 36:09.560]  like, oh, this virus will hurt the economy and get Trump, I mean, you're like, well,
[36:09.560 --> 36:14.080]  that discredits them except their psychotic viewers buy into that.
[36:14.080 --> 36:21.520]  They're obviously the villains, hoping the country does bad, hoping a virus is terrible.
[36:21.520 --> 36:24.480]  Last week they did it a couple of times, this week they did it again and I'm sitting there
[36:24.480 --> 36:33.200]  watching these clips and I'm like, that's a really smart, beautiful, good looking woman
[36:33.200 --> 36:40.800]  up there in a fancy TV studio saying she hopes we have a depression.
[36:40.800 --> 36:46.800]  It's like not even real, it's just cuckoo love but she's a slave, you see, she's being
[36:46.800 --> 36:53.360]  ordered by globalist to do that but it's so terroristic, ladies and gentlemen, to go
[36:53.360 --> 36:59.400]  up there and hope the economy to collapse, to defeat a political enemy, that's terrorism.
[36:59.400 --> 37:05.240]  That's Dr. Evil to give me $24 billion or I will destroy the stock market with my computer
[37:05.240 --> 37:06.240]  program.
[37:06.240 --> 37:12.600]  I mean, that's what, but that's Dr. Evil in a movie, that's Spectre in a movie based
[37:12.600 --> 37:17.880]  on real terror organizations and groups but Hollywood makes a joke about it.
[37:17.880 --> 37:23.080]  And so Mike, I want you to walk through this for viewers and listeners right now that whatever
[37:23.080 --> 37:27.640]  it is, it's their big move on the economy, it's their big move on Trump and Trump's
[37:27.640 --> 37:32.920]  not perfect but notice while he was distracted with the Senate trial, they were launching
[37:32.920 --> 37:37.080]  all this worldwide with their response and you could see the setup but I think there's
[37:37.080 --> 37:42.840]  still time for Trump to realize what's happened, come out and repudiate the bureaucrats, fire
[37:42.840 --> 37:46.960]  some people and do what Pat Buchanan's saying.
[37:46.960 --> 37:51.640]  Trump needs to cover all bases here and I don't think it's an if, it's a win, he begins
[37:51.640 --> 37:53.280]  to give blame for this, it's already starting.
[37:53.280 --> 37:59.360]  Well, all they had to do to set up Trump for this was delay testing for about a month and
[37:59.360 --> 38:01.720]  that's exactly what the CDC did.
[38:01.720 --> 38:06.840]  They sent out test kits in early February that turned out to be faulty, the reagents
[38:06.840 --> 38:11.080]  were bad, the kits just did not work, they produced false positives and false negatives
[38:11.080 --> 38:13.640]  and then they promised, oh, we'll send you new kits.
[38:13.640 --> 38:18.680]  But what wasn't reported Alex by the mainstream media is that during this entire time, state
[38:18.680 --> 38:23.400]  labs and local labs were prohibited from conducting their own tests.
[38:23.400 --> 38:29.160]  So the CDC had ordered them to not conduct tests and the FDA had enforced that.
[38:29.160 --> 38:33.120]  In fact, I've got a little documentary I might play a minute later on that's up on
[38:33.120 --> 38:36.880]  band.video that actually documents all of that.
[38:36.880 --> 38:39.640]  The CDC was involved in halting the testing.
[38:39.640 --> 38:44.000]  Now, that allowed the virus to spread and remember the flow chart that we showed yesterday
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.840]  and Kit Daniels covered it in an article on infowars.com, the flow chart specifically
[38:48.840 --> 38:55.040]  prohibited testing of people or avoided testing of people who got the transmission in America
[38:55.040 --> 38:58.440]  from another American who had not been to China, they're showing it on screen right
[38:58.440 --> 38:59.440]  now.
[38:59.440 --> 39:02.720]  That chart is the coverup, it's proof of the coverup.
[39:02.720 --> 39:06.400]  They allowed it to spread just like we've seen in California for 11 days.
[39:06.400 --> 39:08.520]  Now here's how they're going to spring the trap.
[39:08.520 --> 39:14.760]  As of last night, the CDC and the FDA just gave approval to dozens of labs across America
[39:14.760 --> 39:17.360]  to begin testing Monday.
[39:17.360 --> 39:22.600]  So once these tests begin, and this is my prediction, Alex, you can bank on it.
[39:22.600 --> 39:28.080]  Once these tests begin, we're going to start seeing tens and then dozens and then after
[39:28.080 --> 39:30.440]  a week or two hundreds.
[39:30.440 --> 39:36.040]  Basically the Italy scenario is about to unfold in America and overnight, just like what happened
[39:36.040 --> 39:37.040]  in Italy.
[39:37.040 --> 39:42.040]  It's going from 30 cases to 1600 cases in just a few days.
[39:42.040 --> 39:46.120]  That kind of scenario is about to happen here and they're going to blame Trump.
[39:46.120 --> 39:47.440]  They're setting it up.
[39:47.440 --> 39:48.440]  And Trump has a very...
[39:48.440 --> 39:49.440]  Oh, you can see it.
[39:49.440 --> 39:52.320]  So there's your headline, expert.
[39:52.320 --> 39:57.720]  Italy scenario will begin within the United States within three to four weeks.
[39:57.720 --> 39:58.920]  The trap is set against Trump.
[39:58.920 --> 39:59.920]  I mean...
[39:59.920 --> 40:00.920]  That's it.
[40:00.920 --> 40:03.320]  The trap to destroy Trump is confirmed.
[40:03.320 --> 40:07.440]  But Trump has a very narrow window of opportunity right now to get ahead of this thing and Papucana
[40:07.440 --> 40:13.000]  is right and we've been urging Trump to get right with this and he's been listening unfortunately
[40:13.000 --> 40:17.520]  to Dr. Fauci from the NIH who I believe is part of the problem here and he's put Mike
[40:17.520 --> 40:18.720]  Pence in charge.
[40:18.720 --> 40:19.720]  Nothing against Mike Pence.
[40:19.720 --> 40:22.880]  He's a great American, but he's not an epidemiologist.
[40:22.880 --> 40:27.480]  So where are the scientists who really know this thing?
[40:27.480 --> 40:31.520]  Even like Michael Savage is an epidemiologist, he knows more than Mike Pence just bluntly
[40:31.520 --> 40:36.200]  stated, I'm not insulting Mike Pence, but Michael Savage knows more than Mike Pence
[40:36.200 --> 40:37.440]  about this virus.
[40:37.440 --> 40:38.920]  They should put Savage in charge of this.
[40:38.920 --> 40:40.320]  Michael, that's a great idea.
[40:40.320 --> 40:44.720]  Hey, Daria, will you literally just tell Savage, hey, Alex, once you're on, please,
[40:44.720 --> 40:48.640]  because you've got a degree in this, we respect you, Dr. Savage, get him on.
[40:48.640 --> 40:53.680]  Yeah, Savage would be, I believe, I can't speak for him, but I believe he would be confirming
[40:53.680 --> 40:56.600]  everything that we are saying because he can also do the math.
[40:56.600 --> 40:57.600]  He knows exactly what's going on.
[40:57.600 --> 41:00.760]  He's also got a degree and a very rare degree in botany.
[41:00.760 --> 41:02.600]  Yeah, that's right.
[41:02.600 --> 41:04.120]  And he's got a science background.
[41:04.120 --> 41:05.320]  He's a published scientist.
[41:05.320 --> 41:06.800]  He's a very smart person.
[41:06.800 --> 41:07.920]  He knows what's going on.
[41:07.920 --> 41:10.960]  And yet we have a problem we have in America right now, Alex.
[41:10.960 --> 41:14.920]  Oh, and by the way, I got to mention this, confirmed in Mexico as of this morning.
[41:14.920 --> 41:16.680]  So we've got a confirmed case in Mexico.
[41:16.680 --> 41:20.480]  We've got you predicted two weeks ago and you said once that happens, all it's just,
[41:20.480 --> 41:21.680]  there's no control that border.
[41:21.680 --> 41:24.200]  Alex, I was in the control room during the break.
[41:24.200 --> 41:28.160]  Fox News was running news that you and I reported two weeks ago.
[41:28.160 --> 41:31.720]  So today's Fox News was info wars two weeks ago.
[41:31.720 --> 41:33.240]  And I mean, it's just insane.
[41:33.240 --> 41:35.960]  We have been so far ahead of the curve on this and you're right.
[41:35.960 --> 41:37.960]  I said it's coming to Mexico.
[41:37.960 --> 41:39.880]  In fact, I can lay it out for you.
[41:39.880 --> 41:41.480]  People are going to flee Mexico at some point.
[41:41.480 --> 41:42.480]  They're going to flee the virus.
[41:42.480 --> 41:43.880]  They're going to go through the open borders.
[41:43.880 --> 41:46.720]  They're going to run to the sanctuary cities like San Francisco.
[41:46.720 --> 41:49.120]  You're going to have coronavirus outbreaks in sanctuary.
[41:49.120 --> 41:53.320]  They're a giant open, sir, feces, needles, incubators.
[41:53.320 --> 41:54.320]  That's right.
[41:54.320 --> 41:59.280]  Nancy Pelosi is not going to be walking around Chinatown anymore very soon because it's going
[41:59.280 --> 42:04.120]  to be all over San Francisco and places like that because they're sanctuary cities.
[42:04.120 --> 42:06.600]  So it's, it's not hard really to predict this.
[42:06.600 --> 42:11.000]  It's just that there's a psychological barrier in the minds of most people.
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.320]  They can't fathom this.
[42:13.320 --> 42:15.960]  And that's why there's, let me cut you through that barrier.
[42:15.960 --> 42:21.320]  And I know our audience doesn't have that problem, but they're realists, but it's man-made
[42:21.320 --> 42:25.460]  Obama transferred it to China, martial laws breaking out everywhere.
[42:25.460 --> 42:28.960]  It's either a globalist takeover hyping it or it's super deadly.
[42:28.960 --> 42:32.120]  Either way, they're making a big tyrannical move.
[42:32.120 --> 42:33.720]  And then we start looking at the numbers.
[42:33.720 --> 42:37.320]  There is a higher death rate than what they were previously saying.
[42:37.320 --> 42:41.320]  So when we come back, Mike, let's talk about projecting into the future.
[42:41.320 --> 42:42.320]  What comes next?
[42:42.320 --> 42:44.040]  And what should we all be doing?
[42:44.040 --> 42:46.560]  What should I be doing to protect myself and my family?

[45:03.120 --> 45:05.240]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[45:05.240 --> 45:11.360]  I'm pointing out the way forward things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work
[45:11.360 --> 45:15.880]  that if you will listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing
[45:15.880 --> 45:22.440]  it is and then your support of the product we're selling will help you and will help
[45:22.440 --> 45:24.560]  us and it's symbiotic.
[45:24.560 --> 45:30.000]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's
[45:30.000 --> 45:34.680]  the bad halogen and people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so
[45:34.680 --> 45:41.000]  thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Group like eight years ago and started taking true
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.480]  iodine, atomic iodine.
[45:43.480 --> 45:49.240]  We've got it back in stock X2, 40% off right now at InfoWarsStore.com and I'm telling you

[45:58.680 --> 46:03.320]  There's a lot of things I can say about the high quality storeable food we sell at InfoWarsStore.com
[46:03.320 --> 46:07.360]  but everybody knows any product I sell is going to be high quality at a great price
[46:07.360 --> 46:09.480]  because I treat you like I want to be treated.
[46:09.480 --> 46:12.440]  It is my religion, the golden rule.
[46:12.440 --> 46:18.480]  But the bad news is our main sponsor that does a great job, my patriot, is now three
[46:18.480 --> 46:20.360]  to four weeks out before they ship food.
[46:20.360 --> 46:23.960]  They have the food but they've got to package it and any day now they may come and tell
[46:23.960 --> 46:28.480]  me, oh sorry, we're not selling food anymore because they're not going to take orders for
[46:28.480 --> 46:29.760]  food they don't have.
[46:29.760 --> 46:33.000]  Now you get your order in now, you get the high quality food.
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.040]  It's a smart move, it funds the import, you can't lose.
[46:36.040 --> 46:40.000]  Take action at InfoWarsStore.com whether it's three weeks, four weeks, five weeks, six weeks,

[46:48.600 --> 46:49.600]  packaged.

[46:53.440 --> 47:01.960]  in now to lock it in and it funds the InfoWars 360 win at 4store.com.
[47:01.960 --> 47:12.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:12.800 --> 47:31.320]  So Mike Adams is about to break down some math about the exponential spread of this virus
[47:31.320 --> 47:35.160]  that clearly is race specific, very sad for Asian folks but still going to kill a lot of
[47:35.160 --> 47:39.800]  white and black people in Hispanics but the big global response what's really behind that
[47:39.800 --> 47:43.800]  and how bad is it going to get, he's going to talk about that here in a moment but first
[47:43.800 --> 47:50.600]  off it's my duty to report this to you as Alex Jones is talking to us who just tells
[47:50.600 --> 47:51.600]  it like it is.
[47:51.600 --> 47:57.480]  Let's just trust in God, I put the chips out.
[47:57.480 --> 48:02.040]  My son wants to do a podcast with me called I'm Not Bragg and when I give you the good
[48:02.040 --> 48:05.280]  news of what's going on I say I'm not bragging but I'm not going to say that anymore, I'm
[48:05.280 --> 48:11.200]  going to say it's my duty to report to you the victories we're having because it's not
[48:11.200 --> 48:15.560]  patronization when I tell you you did all this.
[48:15.560 --> 48:20.240]  Many of you have been listening for 20, 25, 26 years.
[48:20.240 --> 48:22.840]  You could be black, you could be white, you could be Hispanic, you could be old, you could
[48:22.840 --> 48:27.360]  be young but you spread the word about the broadcast, you stood up for the broadcast,
[48:27.360 --> 48:31.720]  you bought products for the broadcast, you thanked local stations for carrying the broadcast,
[48:31.720 --> 48:32.720]  you did this.
[48:32.720 --> 48:40.320]  I really want to do like a documentary or something, a short one about the secret of
[48:40.320 --> 48:48.000]  humanity's success or something because I had a vision and my vision almost like field
[48:48.000 --> 48:52.160]  of dreams just build it and they will come that hey they're pushing globalism and world
[48:52.160 --> 48:56.640]  government and communism and saying America's bad, I've traveled the world and it's terrible
[48:56.640 --> 49:03.200]  and America's not perfect but it's the best house in a bad neighborhood and the ideas
[49:03.200 --> 49:08.240]  of it is where we stopped having slaves and then worldwide they stopped and where women
[49:08.240 --> 49:12.400]  got empowered and so I'm like we're pretty damn good, why is everybody saying we're
[49:12.400 --> 49:13.400]  so bad?
[49:13.400 --> 49:17.160]  These authoritarians need to discredit America, the idea of the renters are honest because
[49:17.160 --> 49:25.240]  they can't compete with it so long story short, I used to get Nigel Farage on 20 years
[49:25.240 --> 49:28.680]  ago and he'd come on any time I could get him, I'd have all these UKippers on almost
[49:28.680 --> 49:34.000]  every week, they were a little tiny party and they went to being a very powerful party
[49:34.000 --> 49:38.120]  and then Briggs it and you know the rest of history and then splitting up into other
[49:38.120 --> 49:45.240]  nationalists and patriot parties and he's been on the show several times and said no,
[49:45.240 --> 49:48.640]  UKip took off about 20 years ago, back then he said 15 years ago, it was like five years
[49:48.640 --> 49:54.080]  ago because your show was so big in the UK over the internet that I'd knock on doors
[49:54.080 --> 49:57.520]  when he would and they'd say oh yeah I'm from UKip, I saw it on Alex Jones so he said about
[49:57.520 --> 50:03.000]  half of UKip's support was from us just because we existed, just because I was on the air
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.480]  and just because on Alexa ratings we were like number 70 or something in the UK, a bigger
[50:07.480 --> 50:14.080]  percentage listorship than say in the US, back then we were like number 500 for websites
[50:14.080 --> 50:19.760]  and it wasn't that I was that good, it was that the truth resonated and I believed freedom
[50:19.760 --> 50:24.280]  and justice and free market and in human empowerment and renaissance would be better
[50:24.280 --> 50:31.040]  than globalism and all the anti-human corruption and the pedophilia and all of it so I launched
[50:31.040 --> 50:38.400]  an operation at Bilderberg covering it 14 years ago, 15 years ago called Operation 1776
[50:38.400 --> 50:46.320]  Worldwide and I got it because I saw a Hells Angels sign said Hells Angels Worldwide and
[50:46.320 --> 50:52.760]  I'm not for the Hells Angels but I was like why don't we have 1776 Worldwide, like you
[50:52.760 --> 50:56.600]  believe in America or you believe in renaissance, you believe in freedom, you believe in self-defense,
[50:56.600 --> 51:02.200]  you believe in justice, you believe in God, you believe in Jesus, 1776 Worldwide and you
[51:02.200 --> 51:10.160]  want to help the oppressed 1776 Worldwide and I did this organically just believing in humanity
[51:10.160 --> 51:13.880]  and then I do know that the Defense Intelligence Agency about 10 years ago really liked it
[51:13.880 --> 51:17.920]  some other groups kind of helped leverage it and push it, I wasn't involved in that,
[51:17.920 --> 51:22.680]  they knew reverse psychology and Pet Lettus put out pamphlets saying do not look at this
[51:22.680 --> 51:26.880]  ideology of Alex Jones knowing they would actually take the bait so I did get help
[51:26.880 --> 51:31.840]  from Good Elements, the Pentagon, I didn't even know about but here it is ladies and
[51:31.840 --> 51:36.280]  gentlemen but again you build it they will come, the Pentagon comes, everybody comes
[51:36.280 --> 51:40.080]  because they don't want to be globalist but they want to see leadership and a chance at
[51:40.080 --> 51:43.400]  a future you've got to be the change you want to see in the world, you've got to be that
[51:43.400 --> 51:50.920]  leader so I'm there and at CPAC XJ and this guy walks over and he goes hey would you like
[51:50.920 --> 51:57.360]  to talk to Eduardo Bolsonaro, that's like the Donald Trump of Brazil, the guy that got
[51:57.360 --> 52:01.720]  his dad into politics, I go and I got him, he goes Alex I tried to get old you for years
[52:01.720 --> 52:05.680]  to have my dad on, I'm like I'm sorry I missed your info, he goes that's okay, he goes but
[52:05.680 --> 52:11.000]  you inspired us and all of this and you helped get my dad involved, we're going to air the
[52:11.000 --> 52:14.280]  interview next hour, we're going to premiere it at the end of the hour, my guest is a guest
[52:14.280 --> 52:18.760]  coming up but here's his card, his personal number and he's coming on the show, he's
[52:18.760 --> 52:24.640]  going to get his dad on but the point is, is this is real outlaw, this is real rock
[52:24.640 --> 52:28.840]  and roll, this is what rock stars wish they were, beating up guitars on stage, I don't
[52:28.840 --> 52:32.640]  care about getting the son of some foreign leader on but when it's this guy that got
[52:32.640 --> 52:36.320]  his dad involved in politics and he's a member of Congress there and they're kicking ass
[52:36.320 --> 52:41.120]  and Brazil could be as powerful as the US with the people and the land they've got,
[52:41.120 --> 52:48.160]  most powerful country in South America, amazing, this is a big deal folks and the light in
[52:48.160 --> 52:53.720]  his eyes and his crew's eyes was amazing and to sit there and have him say you inspired
[52:53.720 --> 52:57.720]  us, you helped wake us up, you helped build the blueprint of resistance this journey worldwide
[52:57.720 --> 53:04.320]  and then to have Nigel Farage saying we did that, you did that, God did that by inspiring
[53:04.320 --> 53:09.720]  us, by inspiring me, I believe I can inspire you, you inspired others and it's a chain
[53:09.720 --> 53:14.680]  reaction and we haven't won yet but man we should celebrate the power of this, Mike
[53:14.680 --> 53:17.600]  I'll host a little bit with you in the next hour, you're going to do that, we got your
[53:17.600 --> 53:22.040]  guest comes, you better go do it now, the mathematics of this but I just wanted to give
[53:22.040 --> 53:26.320]  people the good news is that yeah my dad's going to come on, we're going to come on,
[53:26.320 --> 53:29.560]  we love you, we wouldn't want to talk to you for years, thank you and they were literally
[53:29.560 --> 53:34.200]  his people looking at me like I was like superhero, I was looking at them like superheroes, we're
[53:34.200 --> 53:39.880]  just men that want to be free but that's the power of believing in 1776 worldwide, now
[53:39.880 --> 53:41.960]  spreading worldwide, Mike Adams.
[53:41.960 --> 53:46.680]  Okay, that's amazing information, yeah there is good news that comes out of this, a lot
[53:46.680 --> 53:51.240]  of things are changing and if we are wise about this and if the president is wise about
[53:51.240 --> 53:55.200]  this, he can use this opportunity for great leadership and really revolutionary change.
[53:55.200 --> 53:59.960]  Exactly, viruses spread but so do good ideas, viruses spread but so do good ideas, so I
[53:59.960 --> 54:03.400]  know you're tunnel vision on the virus, you're absolutely right, the president's got to
[54:03.400 --> 54:04.400]  give us the numbers.
[54:04.400 --> 54:09.760]  All right, watch this Alex, this is going to blow your mind too and overhead shot please,
[54:09.760 --> 54:14.440]  all right here it is, if this doubles every 2.5 days which is what we're getting from
[54:14.440 --> 54:22.160]  certain studies, then a 25 day delay in testing by the CDC that's 10 doublings, 2 to the power
[54:22.160 --> 54:28.560]  of 10 is 1024 which means that if we had two infections at the beginning of this, then
[54:28.560 --> 54:35.840]  now we have 1024 infections, so the CDC's delay in this has allowed two infections in
[54:35.840 --> 54:41.560]  America to become 1000 plus infections in America, this was done on purpose but that's
[54:41.560 --> 54:46.600]  the power of exponential growth and that's incredible, so the headline is, the take away
[54:46.600 --> 54:52.240]  is CDC intentionally allows at least 1000 infections, well I mean that's 1000 infections
[54:52.240 --> 54:58.520]  for every two people who were infected, so if there were 200 people, then we have 1000
[54:58.520 --> 55:05.960]  what, 10,000 plus infections, this, I think right now conservatively we have you know
[55:05.960 --> 55:10.560]  what, 4000 infections in America, conservatively right now, they just haven't been tested yet
[55:10.560 --> 55:16.480]  but the power of exponential growth, actually I should have said if it's 200 infections
[55:16.480 --> 55:21.960]  it might be over 100,000 now, right now in America, I didn't even add the right number
[55:21.960 --> 55:28.760]  of zeros but look, this is out of control and the CDC has done a great disservice to
[55:28.760 --> 55:34.160]  America in setting a trap for Trump, they prohibited local labs from doing the testing
[55:34.160 --> 55:38.920]  and I remember, well and Governor Newsome now says they don't have enough test kits
[55:38.920 --> 55:44.160]  in California, yeah, I've been saying that here on Infowars for weeks and people said
[55:44.160 --> 55:49.800]  oh that's a conspiracy theory, you know even a caller called into Rush Limbaugh the other
[55:49.800 --> 55:54.440]  day and Rush said didn't believe it, well Rush is going to have to apologize to his
[55:54.440 --> 55:59.040]  listeners real soon because this is real, these numbers are real, this thing is exponential
[55:59.040 --> 56:00.040]  and it's in California.
[56:00.040 --> 56:05.240]  Well Mike, we know they covered up the testing, is there any other reason they would have
[56:05.240 --> 56:08.880]  done this other than wanting to incubate it, what are the other plausible reasons?
[56:08.880 --> 56:13.560]  Well the CDC gets enormous funding the bigger this emergency becomes and they get to declare
[56:13.560 --> 56:17.400]  medical martial law, so we're talking about quarantines now and guess who's going to be
[56:17.400 --> 56:22.360]  in charge of the quarantines, the vaccine people inside the government and then oh look
[56:22.360 --> 56:30.800]  here's a story today where you've got a, where is it, you've got experts now that say that
[56:30.800 --> 56:35.720]  there should be, you should be disallowed to fly if you don't have a coronavirus vaccine,
[56:35.720 --> 56:38.880]  that was on Yahoo News this morning, I've got it here somewhere but you shouldn't be allowed
[56:38.880 --> 56:43.880]  to even fly, so now they're going to have mandatory vaccines, you'll be denied access
[56:43.880 --> 56:48.880]  to public transportation and who knows what else because you're not getting the vaccine
[56:48.880 --> 56:52.320]  and this vaccine is not even going to be safe because it'll be rushed, they'll have no quality
[56:52.320 --> 56:57.240]  control and it might be a live virus vaccine, absolutely and then those of us that don't
[56:57.240 --> 57:03.960]  take it will be the bad guys we're told, yeah exactly and this gives the CDC the justification
[57:03.960 --> 57:10.200]  to call for the arrest and imprisonment of anti-vaxxers saying that those individuals
[57:10.200 --> 57:17.680]  are getting people killed when in fact it is the bioweapons death science people that
[57:17.680 --> 57:21.320]  Francis Boyle warned us about, those are the people that are getting us all killed and
[57:21.320 --> 57:25.400]  it's the same people running the vaccine industry, they're going to get us killed while they
[57:25.400 --> 57:28.320]  claim to be our savior, that's what's happening Alex.
[57:28.320 --> 57:32.240]  Alright Mike Adams, I'm going to do five more minutes for you now you've got your guests

[59:51.880 --> 1:00:15.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:19.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide and Mike Adams is about to take
[1:00:19.360 --> 1:00:26.240]  over and break down the news, he's got a special guest joining him as well in the last
[1:00:26.240 --> 1:00:29.880]  segment of this hour, big interview we're going to premiere here, Rob is literally
[1:00:29.880 --> 1:00:34.480]  in the room next to us, just getting the club together and adding a few videos of his father
[1:00:34.480 --> 1:00:40.400]  being stabbed, the president of Brazil, but just incredibly exciting to hear you help
[1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:46.600]  inspire the revolution in Brazil, we watch your show, my dad loves you, we already knew
[1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:52.720]  that but like you're standing there and this guy's a member of Congress in Brazil and Brazil
[1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:57.840]  is a very important country, folks don't know and this hemisphere is second only to the
[1:00:57.840 --> 1:01:01.040]  United States, we can say Canada but Brazil is more important than Canada, I think it's
[1:01:01.040 --> 1:01:07.320]  Canada, it's just amazing and I want to tell us there's something else too, when you spread
[1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:11.600]  the word about the live feeds, I say this all the time but I want you to get it, the
[1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:16.400]  globalist and the oppressive systems think they can beat humanity but what you're human
[1:01:16.400 --> 1:01:21.400]  intelligence, when you spread a link, when you spread an article, when you take action,
[1:01:21.400 --> 1:01:27.880]  you spread a natural news.com article or an M4.com article by hand, hanging up on the wall, all
[1:01:27.880 --> 1:01:34.600]  of that is powerful and it overrides the AI, this is the real first big war against human
[1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:41.680]  armies in political action against AI robots, we think of a robot like Danger Will Robinson
[1:01:41.680 --> 1:01:46.920]  but these are robots that are within the network watching us, controlling us, manipulating
[1:01:46.920 --> 1:01:52.080]  us with machine learning to see what we'll submit to but we can just override everything
[1:01:52.080 --> 1:01:58.480]  they do by simply saying we don't submit to it and so that's why right now your action,
[1:01:58.480 --> 1:02:06.000]  your prayer, your action, your financial support, your spreading the word isn't paramount, paramount
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:09.640]  is the top of a mountain means the highest point, we're beyond the highest point of a
[1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:17.080]  mountain, it's the North Star, the North Star is above there, the North Star is in the heaven
[1:02:17.080 --> 1:02:24.600]  and so they go low, we go so high that we're not even the same universe as them, Mike Adams
[1:02:24.600 --> 1:02:27.120]  tell them what you've got coming up with your next guest.
[1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:31.520]  Well look I've got two great guests coming up, we've got Dave Hodges joining us here shortly
[1:02:31.520 --> 1:02:37.040]  from the Common Sense Show with some unique analysis and then we've got James Lyons Weiler
[1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:41.280]  who is an expert in virology and has been, I think your guest previously but he's got
[1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:47.040]  new information for us today but I just want to say a couple things Alex, number one I'm
[1:02:47.040 --> 1:02:51.600]  humbled and I really appreciate you inviting me to host this week when you called me Monday
[1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:56.840]  and said hey can you host for four days and I'm in the middle of this crazy insane demand
[1:02:56.840 --> 1:03:01.200]  and warehouse operation, I wasn't sure that I could but we made it work and I think this
[1:03:01.200 --> 1:03:05.360]  is the most important thing that I can be contributing right now to the Info Wars audience
[1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:12.240]  so I appreciate being here but I do the homework on this Alex, I make sure I double and triple
[1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:16.200]  check everything that I'm doing just like I'm doing the math, we're doing the analysis,
[1:03:16.200 --> 1:03:23.880]  we're getting feeds out of Asia, folks if you watch Info Wars you are weeks ahead of
[1:03:23.880 --> 1:03:30.160]  what the mainstream media will report later and I want to tell you here this weekend folks,
[1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:34.680]  I mean this weekend you better get your preps ready, this may be the last weekend before
[1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:39.240]  mainstream America starts to wake up and realize that this is happening.
[1:03:39.240 --> 1:03:44.080]  First thing I'm doing at 8 a.m. tomorrow is I'm going to the grocery store, there's
[1:03:44.080 --> 1:03:47.080]  a lot of little items you want to add to storeable food just for the future and I'm going to
[1:03:47.080 --> 1:03:51.640]  buy a bunch more food and then I'm going to go buy more ammo, it's just gut level, it's
[1:03:51.640 --> 1:03:53.800]  the right thing to do, it's that box you check off.
[1:03:53.800 --> 1:03:57.400]  Well and like I said yesterday on your show there are certain things that can't be found
[1:03:57.400 --> 1:04:03.920]  in storeable food such as you know cooking oil or butter or peanut butter or lard or
[1:04:03.920 --> 1:04:08.100]  other things that add calories and folks you should be thinking about not only order the
[1:04:08.100 --> 1:04:12.560]  storeable food which has a very long shelf life but what can you get locally right now
[1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:15.120]  too that you can use to augment that food.
[1:04:15.120 --> 1:04:20.160]  You can take a bucket of quinoa and if you add butter to it now you've actually got kind
[1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:26.640]  of quinoa soup or an egg and some butter, now you've got a rich broth high in protein,
[1:04:26.640 --> 1:04:30.440]  high in calories, that's good survival food and it's dirt cheap.
[1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:35.880]  You know it works, just get prepared everybody, this is probably your last chance.
[1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:39.960]  I totally agree, I'm going to say one more thing when we come back on the other side
[1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:44.400]  with Mike Adams, 60 seconds so he's going to take over the next two hours and then we've
[1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:49.680]  got Dr. Nick Feggich, can't wait to hear what he has to say of earth rising in the form
[1:04:49.680 --> 1:04:54.680]  now or in the war room, buy from CPAC with Owen Shroyer, whatever you do spread the links,
[1:04:54.680 --> 1:04:56.680]  that is the resistance.
[1:04:56.680 --> 1:05:05.800]  Cobra Commander here reminding you to not own firearms, to not take supplements, to not
[1:05:05.800 --> 1:05:12.920]  get sunshine and to not love Jesus and of course do not get storeable foods or any other
[1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:23.760]  types of colloidal nano silver at infowarstore.com, do not do it, trust CNN, trust MSNBC, drink
[1:05:23.760 --> 1:05:31.880]  fluoridated water just like the loving kiss of a king cobra, pumping deadly, I mean loving
[1:05:31.880 --> 1:05:40.000]  helpful nutrients into your body, hug the cobra, love the cobra, kiss the cobra but
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:55.560]  never, never go to infowars.com or infowarsstore.com, do not order those products, silence, don't
[1:05:55.560 --> 1:06:01.560]  sell it.
[1:06:01.560 --> 1:06:14.840]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups, you want to stop tyranny, well so
[1:06:14.840 --> 1:06:23.040]  does he, live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:23.040 --> 1:06:27.040]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:31.320]  My cat has taken over, he's got two huge guests right now, I'm getting on the airplane a few
[1:06:31.320 --> 1:06:35.800]  hours back to Austin, definitely do a live emergency piece tomorrow, no one's going to
[1:06:35.800 --> 1:06:40.840]  be here, I bring president from tomorrow at CPAC with Savannah Hernandez, so much of
[1:06:40.840 --> 1:06:47.240]  the other amazing crew but I got to say this, I got a chance over 20 years ago to get involved
[1:06:47.240 --> 1:06:53.760]  with Hollywood that called by Hollywood without asking and put in major movies by Rick Linkler
[1:06:53.760 --> 1:06:58.360]  and then big Hollywood, real Hollywood, because he's a Texan, he's a good guy, tried to get
[1:06:58.360 --> 1:07:04.160]  me involved and I was like, this sucks, this is empty, I don't want this, I'm not a person
[1:07:04.160 --> 1:07:06.880]  that gets into that type of fake status.
[1:07:06.880 --> 1:07:12.200]  But with Nigel Farage that got the UK out of the New World Order and the guy was incredible,
[1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:17.320]  they tried to kill him six times, the police have confirmed, at least twice in France
[1:07:17.320 --> 1:07:23.920]  and England, those on the air and says you, infowars, is what let UKIP explode 20 years
[1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:28.680]  ago, 15 years ago, and it's how we became a major party, people listening to you in
[1:07:28.680 --> 1:07:34.640]  the UK, that to me, that's not like, ooh, I'm important, that's like, thank you, God,
[1:07:34.640 --> 1:07:36.200]  we're doing it.
[1:07:36.200 --> 1:07:40.680]  And then coming up last second of this hour, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a member of Congress, son
[1:07:40.680 --> 1:07:46.360]  of the president of Brazil, the Trump of South America, Brazil is just as important
[1:07:46.360 --> 1:07:50.680]  as the US, potentially, with the people and the resources they have, the most powerful
[1:07:50.680 --> 1:07:57.360]  country in South Central America, and it's just doing so good under him.
[1:07:57.360 --> 1:08:02.000]  And to say, my father's inspired by you, we tried to get on your show, you help wake
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:08.320]  us up to the 1776, all of it, he's sitting there telling me this, and yeah, we'll come
[1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:11.880]  to Austin, my father will come on the show.
[1:08:11.880 --> 1:08:16.760]  I already knew that, but it shows why they want to shut us down.
[1:08:16.760 --> 1:08:23.640]  And so I want to say this again, it's you, the listeners and viewers that did this.
[1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:27.960]  Half the time, I'm a train wreck, unlistable, unwatchable, everybody knows the spirit is
[1:08:27.960 --> 1:08:33.640]  there, and I want to win, and I'm not a BSer, and I'm willing to die to tell the truth.
[1:08:33.640 --> 1:08:40.280]  And there are other people who were inspiring, who saw what we were doing, long before even
[1:08:40.280 --> 1:08:44.360]  Trump came along, they were fighting and running for office, trying to kick the globalists
[1:08:44.360 --> 1:08:45.360]  out of their country.
[1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:50.600]  I remember, I had different reporters on, even Greg Palace, the BBC on, of the IMF World
[1:08:50.600 --> 1:08:55.400]  Bank plan to bankrupt Brazil, and I remember, we had like newspapers were like, we have
[1:08:55.400 --> 1:08:59.120]  a permission to republish the transcripts, this interview, and it was putting all these
[1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:03.960]  papers in Brazil, that was 15 years ago.
[1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:09.720]  But it's that work we did, while the globalists ignored us, it absolutely changed the surface
[1:09:09.720 --> 1:09:14.960]  of the planet, with the nationalists and patriots being elected everywhere, you, the audience,
[1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:20.080]  especially if you were listening 10, 15 years ago, 20 years ago, and supported us.
[1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:21.080]  You did this.
[1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:25.040]  I know you don't want the credit, but I just want to say, I'm on the opposite of a power
[1:09:25.040 --> 1:09:30.720]  trip right now, I'm extremely humbled, because one time they said, oh, this is a member of
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:35.160]  Japanese parliament wants to come on your show, and talk about the New World Order, I didn't,
[1:09:35.160 --> 1:09:37.920]  I was so dumb about Japanese politics, after he came on, they go, you know, that's the
[1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:39.720]  vice president of Japan, right?
[1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:43.720]  I was like, we said the vice president of Japan, I don't know, because he was humbled,
[1:09:43.720 --> 1:09:48.560]  like, oh, I'm a member of parliament, because they're the top kind of parliament, the vice
[1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:51.480]  premier.
[1:09:51.480 --> 1:09:52.480]  We've had a huge effect.
[1:09:52.480 --> 1:09:57.800]  The enemy knows that, I don't think the audience realizes what we've done, because you are
[1:09:57.800 --> 1:10:03.560]  literally why we're here, you are infowars, so please, the storable food is out to six
[1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:07.200]  weeks or more for delivery, depending on what you order, everybody else has sold out their
[1:10:07.200 --> 1:10:13.840]  line to you, taking your orders, this is disgusting, infowarsshore.com has it, but it takes five
[1:10:13.840 --> 1:10:17.200]  to six to seven weeks, depending on what you order, it really is about five weeks, they're
[1:10:17.200 --> 1:10:21.240]  underpromising over delivering your orders in now, because this virus thing, reportedly,
[1:10:21.240 --> 1:10:24.560]  is going to peak in the summer, so you still just have time for your food, but regardless,
[1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:29.000]  get prepared and get ready, and take the body's ultimate tumor formulas down back in stock
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:33.440]  with 40% off, those have been sold out for months back in stock, we're so good for immune
[1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:40.600]  system, take DNA force, 40% off back in stock, the PQQ and the CoQ Gen, take the ultra 12,
[1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:44.840]  super high quality vitamin B12 out of the tongue, now back in stock, 40% off, those
[1:10:44.840 --> 1:10:48.720]  are just as important as the storeable food, it helps find the operation, it's good for
[1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:54.640]  you and your family, take your elderberry, take other things, infowarsstore.com, but
[1:10:54.640 --> 1:11:00.000]  we've really changed history together, that's why the media demonizes infowars and attacks
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:04.080]  us so much, because they know we're really changing the world together, and the great
[1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:08.960]  guests like Mike Adams and Dr. Francis Boyle and Dr. Steve Pachennick, and just you the
[1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:13.880]  listeners and callers, this is uncontrolled, this is real humanity, not getting talking
[1:11:13.880 --> 1:11:19.240]  points, but trying to war game it out together, and that's why it's a symbiotic system, and
[1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:22.880]  I'm just a focal point of this, I'm very, very humbled, I'm going to turn the baton
[1:11:22.880 --> 1:11:25.880]  over now to Mike Adams of naturalnews.com, thank you Mike.
[1:11:25.880 --> 1:11:29.720]  Alex, before you go, watch this demonstration, I brought something here, I interviewed Dr.
[1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:33.880]  Thomas Levy yesterday and he recommended something about combining hydrogen peroxide
[1:11:33.880 --> 1:11:39.000]  with iodine in a nebulizer, and I brought that set up here today just to show you, it's
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:44.200]  only just a few seconds, you take just a standard nebulizer like an essential oil, nebulizer
[1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:51.040]  you take 3% concentration hydrogen peroxide, pour a little bit in there, take a drop of
[1:11:51.040 --> 1:11:57.600]  your iodine like survival shield, put a drop in there, now you turn that on, what you have
[1:11:57.600 --> 1:12:05.640]  is a super oxygenated system that, watch this, that can now, you breathe it in, you're coating
[1:12:05.640 --> 1:12:12.080]  your entire upper respiratory tract with a little tiny amount of iodine combined with
[1:12:12.080 --> 1:12:18.040]  the pathogen killing potential of hydrogen peroxide, and I had a sore throat yesterday
[1:12:18.040 --> 1:12:22.000]  after I did your show, I told your producers, you know, I got to watch this, I went home
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:28.280]  and I did this, and today I feel great, completely symptom free overnight, so this is something
[1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:33.120]  super simple that everybody can do, and you can get iodine right now, that's one thing
[1:12:33.120 --> 1:12:38.440]  that's not sold out, and it costs you almost nothing to do this, so people, you can do
[1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:42.360]  this, you can take care of your health, you can protect yourself in many ways, even without
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:46.680]  a vaccine or without a pharmaceutical, just want to show you that, it's pretty cool stuff,
[1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:47.680]  Alex.
[1:12:47.680 --> 1:12:52.280]  I want to do that because my wife even here on the road has a minifier because it's so
[1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:57.160]  dry, so much garbage, and that just sounds like music to my vibroncule, so I'm going
[1:12:57.160 --> 1:12:59.960]  to try that as soon as I get home, Mike.
[1:12:59.960 --> 1:13:04.840]  Yep, well, thanks Alex, I will take over from here then, I've got a lot of breaking news
[1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:08.160]  folks, we've got Dave Hodges coming up from the Common Sense show, just a little bit of
[1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:12.480]  delay, I want to thank Dave for holding on, we're going to open with Dave in the next
[1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:16.560]  segment, let me cover a few additional headlines that we've got here for you for the remainder
[1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:23.440]  of this segment, as I inhale the vapor of hydrogen peroxide and iodine, I mean why not,
[1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:26.960]  this is good for your health, we can all do this.
[1:13:26.960 --> 1:13:33.040]  First of all, yes, there is now an argument, a Yahoo news story, I've got it right here,
[1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:38.120]  that we've got a law professor, Christopher Robertson, and a professor of medicine, Keith
[1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:43.400]  Joiner, saying that people who are not vaccinated against the coronavirus should not be allowed
[1:13:43.400 --> 1:13:45.380]  to fly commercial flights.
[1:13:45.380 --> 1:13:51.120]  So these two medical tyrants, you might say, they are assuming that the vaccine doesn't
[1:13:51.120 --> 1:13:56.640]  spread the disease, and of course we know from polio vaccines that use live virus strains
[1:13:56.640 --> 1:14:01.480]  that the polio vaccine is the number one cause of polio today, it's so bad that they have
[1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:06.160]  to develop vaccines against the polio caused by other vaccines, so in other words vaccine
[1:14:06.160 --> 1:14:10.480]  induced polio is the number one form of polio spreading in the world right now, but look
[1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:16.040]  where this is going, already calls for medical, martial law in the United States, and it's
[1:14:16.040 --> 1:14:21.080]  going to get worse, here's another one, of course Mexico has confirmed its first coronavirus
[1:14:21.080 --> 1:14:28.240]  case, and according to the epoch times, which has done excellent coverage of this, dozens
[1:14:28.240 --> 1:14:32.560]  of states and local laboratories in the United States will finally have permission to begin
[1:14:32.560 --> 1:14:38.600]  testing for the coronavirus next week, I wanted to ask Dave Hodges about this coming up, what
[1:14:38.600 --> 1:14:43.480]  do you think that means for the number of infections that are likely to be reported
[1:14:43.480 --> 1:14:50.040]  starting next week, Nigeria has confirmed its first case which is now sub-Saharan Africa
[1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:55.200]  has the virus confirmed, Bill Gates had previously estimated that this would kill 10 million
[1:14:55.200 --> 1:15:01.420]  people in Africa alone if it grows uncontained there, and by the way Bill Gates' numbers
[1:15:01.420 --> 1:15:06.480]  are very low, if you actually do the math it's going to be a lot more than 10 million
[1:15:06.480 --> 1:15:12.800]  people if this is not contained, two dogs in Japan have reportedly tested positive for
[1:15:12.800 --> 1:15:17.720]  the coronavirus, that indicates it's crossed into the canine species now and it brings
[1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:23.800]  in a lot of new concerns about pet owners, if this spreads through dogs or if it mutates
[1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:29.240]  crossing back and forth between humans and dogs, what does that mean for any future vaccine
[1:15:29.240 --> 1:15:32.680]  or any treatment against this, what does it mean for pet owners, what does it mean for
[1:15:32.680 --> 1:15:40.000]  people who let their dogs run around with other dogs or dog kennels or dog pounds, what
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:44.240]  does this mean, we don't know all the answers yet, but we'll bring you more information
[1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:48.560]  on the other side of this, Dave Hodges joins us with some good new intel, stay with us,

[1:16:25.440 --> 1:16:30.800]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[1:16:30.800 --> 1:16:35.880]  the world, George Washington had warned us against foreign wars, the United States of
[1:16:35.880 --> 1:16:42.800]  Empire shows that World Wars one and two left England broken, its former colony the US had

[1:17:56.840 --> 1:18:03.720]  A lot of people ask me the M4 war secret and I'll just tell you, I'm just real, now the
[1:18:03.720 --> 1:18:08.920]  problem is I go back and forth though in my mind about where I stand, I mean on basic
[1:18:08.920 --> 1:18:14.160]  stuff like the Second Amendment and family and God, I'm 100% but you get to other issues,
[1:18:14.160 --> 1:18:18.560]  I start asking myself questions, so I'll just tell you, I feel really guilty during the
[1:18:18.560 --> 1:18:23.120]  middle of this crisis selling high quality, swareable food, even though it's pre-positioned,
[1:18:23.120 --> 1:18:27.360]  I'm right, we're right about being man made, we're right about it being super deadly, we're
[1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:32.720]  right about being prepared, it still feels weird to be right, isn't that crazy, but you
[1:18:32.720 --> 1:18:34.680]  know what, I'm getting past that.
[1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:38.600]  We still have swareable food, we have plenty of it, the problem is the packaging of it
[1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:42.520]  and getting it out, other competitors don't have it, they're lying to you.

[1:19:59.840 --> 1:20:11.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:11.120 --> 1:20:17.840]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[1:20:17.840 --> 1:20:27.560]  All right, buckle up, folks, because we are about to go into a deep down the rabbit hole
[1:20:27.560 --> 1:20:31.240]  right now with Dave Hodges from the Common Sense Show.
[1:20:31.240 --> 1:20:33.360]  He'll be joining us in just a minute.
[1:20:33.360 --> 1:20:36.120]  I was handed an update during the break.
[1:20:36.120 --> 1:20:42.840]  Apparently, the MyPatriot supply company is now saying that some orders will take eight
[1:20:42.840 --> 1:20:44.080]  weeks to ship.
[1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:50.280]  So just during that first hour when Alex and I were talking, it went from five to six to
[1:20:50.280 --> 1:20:56.120]  eight weeks to now eight weeks for some orders, not all, but some.
[1:20:56.120 --> 1:21:00.440]  That window of opportunity to get prepared, whether you're talking about storeable food
[1:21:00.440 --> 1:21:04.760]  or even probably at some point ammunition is going to be affected.
[1:21:04.760 --> 1:21:07.720]  I don't know what the firearms market is looking like right now.
[1:21:07.720 --> 1:21:12.800]  I don't know if ARs are disappearing off the shelves yet, but that day will come.
[1:21:12.800 --> 1:21:17.960]  Your window of opportunity to get prepared is collapsing by the hour.
[1:21:17.960 --> 1:21:20.880]  That is no exaggeration.
[1:21:20.880 --> 1:21:27.040]  Now here with some really incredible intelligence is Dave Hodges from the Common Sense Show.com.
[1:21:27.040 --> 1:21:28.600]  I've known Dave for several years.
[1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:31.080]  I've interviewed him a couple of times.
[1:21:31.080 --> 1:21:37.600]  Like most of us, Dave Hodges is a highly controversial person if you see what the mainstream media
[1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:38.600]  says about us.
[1:21:38.600 --> 1:21:43.440]  But Dave has incredible sources in Homeland Security and other areas.
[1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:49.360]  And he's been on the mark with this coronavirus pandemic from day one.
[1:21:49.360 --> 1:21:52.000]  That's why I invited him on the show to get his take on things.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:55.600]  Dave, welcome to the Infowars show.
[1:21:55.600 --> 1:21:56.600]  It's great to have you on.
[1:21:56.600 --> 1:21:57.600]  That's an honor to be with you.
[1:21:57.600 --> 1:21:58.600]  Thanks for having me.
[1:21:58.600 --> 1:22:02.200]  And you're right, controversy is kind of our middle name.
[1:22:02.200 --> 1:22:08.040]  But I'll say this, Mike, in the first week of January, you and I were reporting on this
[1:22:08.040 --> 1:22:10.640]  and we were called Conspiracy Theorists.
[1:22:10.640 --> 1:22:15.400]  And yesterday, I'm out here in California at the 51st State Convention for California
[1:22:15.400 --> 1:22:16.800]  with Paul Preston.
[1:22:16.800 --> 1:22:20.480]  And yesterday I'm listening to Governor Newsom.
[1:22:20.480 --> 1:22:25.840]  And what was a conspiracy theory the first week of January is now a proclamation of the
[1:22:25.840 --> 1:22:28.240]  state of California here in the last week.
[1:22:28.240 --> 1:22:29.240]  That's right.
[1:22:29.240 --> 1:22:30.240]  Yeah.
[1:22:30.240 --> 1:22:31.240]  Incredible.
[1:22:31.240 --> 1:22:32.240]  Yeah.
[1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:33.240]  What the governor just said yesterday is what we were saying weeks ago.
[1:22:33.240 --> 1:22:34.240]  Absolutely.
[1:22:34.240 --> 1:22:35.240]  That there are no test kits in California.
[1:22:35.240 --> 1:22:39.800]  And by the way, just to explain to the viewers, you're coming to us from a hotel.
[1:22:39.800 --> 1:22:41.440]  This is not your normal studio.
[1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:44.160]  The visual quality is not quite as good, but you got good lighting.
[1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:45.240]  So it's all good.
[1:22:45.240 --> 1:22:48.160]  But just so people understand, you know, you're in the field right now.
[1:22:48.160 --> 1:22:52.240]  You're covering the, what is it, the 51st State Convention?
[1:22:52.240 --> 1:22:54.240]  What do you call it there in California?
[1:22:54.240 --> 1:22:55.240]  Exactly.
[1:22:55.240 --> 1:22:56.240]  New California.
[1:22:56.240 --> 1:23:00.040]  And right now they have 52 of the 58 counties committed to the action.
[1:23:00.040 --> 1:23:04.720]  I believe from my perspective that for this to be successful, they're not going to have
[1:23:04.720 --> 1:23:06.080]  to have all 58 counties.
[1:23:06.080 --> 1:23:10.320]  There'll be two California's, but we're going to have to win back the House of Representatives.
[1:23:10.320 --> 1:23:12.800]  That means eliminate the Democratic majority.
[1:23:12.800 --> 1:23:16.920]  And then under article four, section three of the Constitution, following the West Virginia
[1:23:16.920 --> 1:23:20.640]  model, they will be able to become a 51st State.
[1:23:20.640 --> 1:23:24.360]  But I will tell you this, Mike, there's another possibility right now too.
[1:23:24.360 --> 1:23:30.440]  There are 320 billion dollars of debt coming due in April in California.
[1:23:30.440 --> 1:23:34.480]  And my sources tell me well over half of that debt is unaccounted for.
[1:23:34.480 --> 1:23:36.200]  And that means corruption.
[1:23:36.200 --> 1:23:41.080]  And I will tell you this, if they can't pay the pensions and the retirements and all this,
[1:23:41.080 --> 1:23:43.080]  there could be chaos in California.
[1:23:43.080 --> 1:23:47.200]  And I think it's possible President Trump could invoke the Insurrection Act, remove
[1:23:47.200 --> 1:23:49.120]  the leaders of California.
[1:23:49.120 --> 1:23:54.320]  And I think a logical move would be to install the delegated leaders of the new California
[1:23:54.320 --> 1:23:59.240]  movement into that government until things are streamlined and brought into control.
[1:23:59.240 --> 1:24:03.640]  And then I think you'll see smooth sailing to the development of the 51st State.
[1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:08.520]  We will have a 51st State, and there'll be 26 new Republican representatives, there'll
[1:24:08.520 --> 1:24:12.760]  be two Republican senators and a Republican governor because they're rebelling against
[1:24:12.760 --> 1:24:17.440]  a Democratic, Bolshevik, communist style tyranny in the state.
[1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:20.040]  And as a consequence, this is going to happen.
[1:24:20.040 --> 1:24:21.040]  Wow.
[1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:22.640]  So, okay, so many bombshells to cover there.
[1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:27.240]  I didn't even ask you about that yet, you know, I want your take on the coronavirus
[1:24:27.240 --> 1:24:30.360]  California monitoring 8,400 people for possible infections.
[1:24:30.360 --> 1:24:33.960]  The governor of California is saying they've run out of test kits or nearly out.
[1:24:33.960 --> 1:24:36.120]  They weren't allowed to even test for the virus.
[1:24:36.120 --> 1:24:37.360]  California's tested essentially zero.
[1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:41.000]  They sent all their cases to Atlanta for the CDC to test.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:46.720]  And now we have, you know, confirmed domestic human to human transmission, at least one
[1:24:46.720 --> 1:24:48.640]  case in California, many more coming.
[1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:53.920]  But you're talking about, you're talking about a phenomenon here that could happen in Oregon,
[1:24:53.920 --> 1:24:59.760]  in Washington, in many other states where there is highly corrupt Democrat controlled
[1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:05.760]  state capitals surrounded by real America, you know, rural Americans, pro-second amendment,
[1:25:05.760 --> 1:25:11.440]  pro-Trump, pro-God, you know, those are the people in most of the geographic areas of
[1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:12.440]  California.
[1:25:12.440 --> 1:25:18.960]  And yet they are ruled over by this corrupt cabal of criminals who run Sacramento and
[1:25:18.960 --> 1:25:20.840]  the big cities.
[1:25:20.840 --> 1:25:25.640]  Is this, but is this a pipe dream or is this a realistic possible progression here to have
[1:25:25.640 --> 1:25:28.400]  a 51st state?
[1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:34.160]  I think the whole thing, as I said, is contingent upon winning back the House of Representatives.
[1:25:34.160 --> 1:25:38.320]  And the introduction of this coronavirus and the manner it's happening.
[1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:41.920]  As you noticed, they're already blaming Trump and the Republicans.
[1:25:41.920 --> 1:25:46.400]  Bloomberg already has a commercial blaming Trump for the coronavirus.
[1:25:46.400 --> 1:25:50.000]  Goldman Sachs says, watch out for your stock investments.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:54.320]  Trump's inaction and complacency has led to the problem in the stock market.
[1:25:54.320 --> 1:25:58.960]  And of course, Pelosi has been very public along the same lines with her criticism.
[1:25:58.960 --> 1:26:02.720]  So they're making it an election issue.
[1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:07.880]  And I think, depending on how the president handles it, postures it, I think that this
[1:26:07.880 --> 1:26:11.320]  could be a real deciding factor going into November.
[1:26:11.320 --> 1:26:17.640]  Well, you see the open borders policy that the Democrats support is, should really be
[1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:22.480]  blamed for where this pandemic goes if we start to get cross-country infections.
[1:26:22.480 --> 1:26:24.480]  And I know you're well aware of this.
[1:26:24.480 --> 1:26:25.480]  I've talked about it before.
[1:26:25.480 --> 1:26:29.280]  But Mexico now confirmed with the coronavirus, Brazil confirmed.
[1:26:29.280 --> 1:26:31.360]  This is in Central and South America.
[1:26:31.360 --> 1:26:33.040]  It's going to spread uncontrolled.
[1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:34.840]  The R not value is incredibly high.
[1:26:34.840 --> 1:26:39.240]  The number of cases will double about every maybe 2.5, 3.5 days, maybe six days.
[1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:42.520]  We don't know exactly, but it's doubling and doubling and doubling.
[1:26:42.520 --> 1:26:46.040]  So eventually, there are going to be people infected crossing the border.
[1:26:46.040 --> 1:26:50.600]  We already have very poor controls over testing anybody for diseases.
[1:26:50.600 --> 1:26:52.760]  These people are going to go into sanctuary cities.
[1:26:52.760 --> 1:26:57.480]  We're going to see cities like San Francisco, I believe, overrun with coronavirus infected
[1:26:57.480 --> 1:26:58.960]  illegal aliens.
[1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:06.120]  How would that, what does that do to the election in November in your view, Dave Hodges?
[1:27:06.120 --> 1:27:09.360]  Well, I think it just depends how it gets spun.
[1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:13.840]  But the mainstream media is going to make it a Trump problem, no question about it.
[1:27:13.840 --> 1:27:18.840]  And I think that Trump, if he realizes that this is going to bring down the economy for
[1:27:18.840 --> 1:27:23.520]  any length of time, he'll take extraordinary measures to protect the economy, which will
[1:27:23.520 --> 1:27:25.320]  mean extreme quarantines.
[1:27:25.320 --> 1:27:26.680]  And let me just say this too.
[1:27:26.680 --> 1:27:32.560]  I predicted this three weeks ago when people from Zensha tried to get into Hong Kong and
[1:27:32.560 --> 1:27:33.680]  where we buffed.
[1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:38.680]  And this is before the implementation of basically martial law under quarantine protocols.
[1:27:38.680 --> 1:27:42.440]  And I said, a lot of these people are going to find a way to make their way to Mexico.
[1:27:42.440 --> 1:27:44.600]  Mexico in large part is a puppet state of red China.
[1:27:44.600 --> 1:27:47.240]  They control the cartels, the government and so forth.
[1:27:47.240 --> 1:27:49.200]  And I said, watch the borders.
[1:27:49.200 --> 1:27:53.400]  Well, I'm getting increasing reports from Border Patrol and DHS that they are arresting
[1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:55.840]  Chinese nationals at the borders.
[1:27:55.840 --> 1:28:01.160]  So the infiltration of what I like to call these infectons has already begun to happen,
[1:28:01.160 --> 1:28:02.160]  Mike.
[1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:04.920]  And you raised a really good point in the last segment when I was listening to you talk
[1:28:04.920 --> 1:28:07.600]  about this with Alex.
[1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:09.600]  You talked about motivations.
[1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:11.240]  Let me get into one big motivation.
[1:28:11.240 --> 1:28:12.240]  45 seconds.
[1:28:12.240 --> 1:28:17.000]  What will happen when the reporting starts to happen with these new test kits across
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  America?
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:24.280]  I look for extreme delays because until I believe it's May as reported in by the World
[1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:29.240]  Bank, they have about $500 million in funding and we can get to this afterwards.
[1:28:29.240 --> 1:28:31.280]  There's a bet against declaring a pandemic.
[1:28:31.280 --> 1:28:32.280]  Okay.
[1:28:32.280 --> 1:28:33.280]  All right.
[1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:34.680]  We're interviewing Dave Hodges here from the Common Sense Show.
[1:28:34.680 --> 1:28:38.240]  This is Mike Adams on the Alex Jones show.
[1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:42.080]  We've got big questions coming up and some bombshell information we haven't even got
[1:28:42.080 --> 1:28:44.600]  to yet after this short break.
[1:28:44.600 --> 1:28:46.040]  Stay with us.
[1:28:46.040 --> 1:28:47.960]  This thing is going global.
[1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:51.040]  It will not be contained and it's spreading in California.
[1:28:51.040 --> 1:28:52.040]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:59.040]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:02.080]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[1:29:02.080 --> 1:29:07.320]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected,
[1:29:07.320 --> 1:29:09.280]  everybody sees your information.
[1:29:09.280 --> 1:29:14.520]  That's why you need Flash Routers, a custom Wi-Fi router created for privacy.

[1:29:53.200 --> 1:30:00.960]  There's a lot of things I can say about the high-quality storeable food we sell at m4store.com,
[1:30:00.960 --> 1:30:05.280]  but everybody knows any product I sell is going to be high-quality at a great price
[1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:07.400]  because I treat you like I want to be treated.
[1:30:07.400 --> 1:30:10.360]  It is my religion, the golden rule.
[1:30:10.360 --> 1:30:16.440]  But the bad news is, our main sponsor that does a great job, my patriot, is now three
[1:30:16.440 --> 1:30:18.320]  to four weeks out before they ship food.
[1:30:18.320 --> 1:30:20.360]  They have the food, but they've got to package it.
[1:30:20.360 --> 1:30:24.720]  And any day now, they may come and tell me, oh, sorry, we're not selling food anymore
[1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:27.720]  because they're not going to take orders for food they don't have.
[1:30:27.720 --> 1:30:30.920]  Now, you get your order in now, you get the high-quality food.
[1:30:30.920 --> 1:30:31.920]  It's a smart move.
[1:30:31.920 --> 1:30:32.960]  It funds the m4.
[1:30:32.960 --> 1:30:33.960]  You can't lose.
[1:30:33.960 --> 1:30:37.960]  Take action at m4store.com, whether it's three weeks, four weeks, five weeks, six weeks,
[1:30:37.960 --> 1:30:40.000]  a three month, a six month a year.
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:42.920]  They've got it all at m4store.com.
[1:30:42.920 --> 1:30:43.920]  They're in our back end.
[1:30:43.920 --> 1:30:44.920]  We're partnered with them.
[1:30:44.920 --> 1:30:47.080]  They'll ship it out to you the day it's packaged.
[1:30:47.080 --> 1:30:50.880]  They've got the food, but they are days and days behind shipping it out.
[1:30:50.880 --> 1:30:56.640]  So get your order in now to lock it in, and it funds the m4, 361, m4store.com.
[1:30:56.640 --> 1:30:59.400]  There can no longer be any doubt.
[1:30:59.400 --> 1:31:03.360]  This coronavirus is serious on multiple levels.
[1:31:03.360 --> 1:31:04.600]  It's very communicable.
[1:31:04.600 --> 1:31:06.600]  It spreads very, very fast.
[1:31:06.600 --> 1:31:11.320]  It is killing a lot of people, and the Chinese Communist government has covered up just how
[1:31:11.320 --> 1:31:17.040]  bad it is, and the Lighthouse is now openly challenging them, show our Trump's top scientist,
[1:31:17.040 --> 1:31:19.120]  and so is Senator Cotton.
[1:31:19.120 --> 1:31:22.880]  My friends, now is the time to get prepared.
[1:31:22.880 --> 1:31:26.120]  2020 is not a year to play games with.
[1:31:26.120 --> 1:31:29.880]  The globalists are trying to create economic collapse, race riots.
[1:31:29.880 --> 1:31:32.880]  We don't know how bad this virus is going to get here.
[1:31:32.880 --> 1:31:36.200]  That's why listeners to m4 Wars need to be prepared.
[1:31:36.200 --> 1:31:42.200]  And m4warstore.com has the products that make your life better and make you healthier.
[1:31:42.200 --> 1:31:46.000]  We have the last of the immune gargle selling out as we speak.
[1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:50.360]  We have high quality, storeable foods ready to ship, and vitamin mineral fusion is back
[1:31:50.360 --> 1:31:57.360]  in stock along with ultra 12 at m4warstore.com.
[1:31:57.360 --> 1:31:58.360]  Real stuff, man.
[1:31:58.360 --> 1:32:01.240]  We're talking about the real deal here, and I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell
[1:32:01.240 --> 1:32:04.920]  you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running rough shot over and everybody
[1:32:04.920 --> 1:32:05.920]  stops.
[1:32:05.920 --> 1:32:09.360]  I mean, I've got a problem, and we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[1:32:09.360 --> 1:32:12.600]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[1:32:12.600 --> 1:32:18.360]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers, 20 different stickers, impeach
[1:32:18.360 --> 1:32:23.240]  the Democrats, save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment in m4warstore.com,
[1:32:23.240 --> 1:32:25.400]  and it looks like duct tape, it's just a regular sticker.
[1:32:25.400 --> 1:32:29.240]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without
[1:32:29.240 --> 1:32:30.240]  even disrupting things.
[1:32:30.240 --> 1:32:31.800]  People say, why are you doing this?
[1:32:31.800 --> 1:32:32.800]  What's happening?
[1:32:32.800 --> 1:32:36.080]  Well, we're being censored, you know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[1:32:36.080 --> 1:32:39.040]  And Dr. Pachennick, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this
[1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:40.040]  yet.
[1:32:40.040 --> 1:32:41.040]  It's brilliant.
[1:32:41.040 --> 1:32:45.880]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence, and made
[1:32:45.880 --> 1:32:47.320]  it into a weapon.
[1:32:47.320 --> 1:32:50.280]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[1:32:50.280 --> 1:32:52.920]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[1:32:52.920 --> 1:32:53.920]  Silence.
[1:32:53.920 --> 1:32:54.920]  Silence.
[1:32:54.920 --> 1:33:12.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:12.960 --> 1:33:19.760]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[1:33:19.760 --> 1:33:22.080]  It's Mike Adams.
[1:33:22.080 --> 1:33:26.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:26.440 --> 1:33:28.040]  So here's what's extraordinary.
[1:33:28.040 --> 1:33:31.920]  Most people don't even realize this, but the number of confirmed infections outside of
[1:33:31.920 --> 1:33:36.000]  China has already hit 5,000.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:41.640]  And you know, a week ago, that was, or 10 days ago, that was like, what, 500 or something?
[1:33:41.640 --> 1:33:45.400]  I don't know the exact number, but today it's over 5,000.
[1:33:45.400 --> 1:33:49.920]  And for the first time, the number of infections outside of China on a day-to-day basis is
[1:33:49.920 --> 1:33:54.640]  larger than the number of infections reported by China day-to-day, which means, we know
[1:33:54.640 --> 1:33:59.720]  China's lying about this, of course, that WHO is lying, but those lies are actually
[1:33:59.720 --> 1:34:03.960]  becoming less and less relevant to the big picture because there are nations that are
[1:34:03.960 --> 1:34:08.940]  telling the truth, like South Korea, for example, and Italy, probably.
[1:34:08.940 --> 1:34:12.960]  But even the nations that are trying to tell the truth can't test everybody.
[1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:17.560]  So the number of infections they're reporting are only a fraction of the number of infections
[1:34:17.560 --> 1:34:22.360]  that exist, especially given the long incubation period where people have no symptoms.
[1:34:22.360 --> 1:34:26.600]  So how do you even know who to test when you have sustained human-to-human transmission
[1:34:26.600 --> 1:34:27.600]  in your country?
[1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:29.960]  You don't have people who even travel to China.
[1:34:29.960 --> 1:34:30.960]  How do you test them all?
[1:34:30.960 --> 1:34:32.200]  You can't.
[1:34:32.200 --> 1:34:37.160]  So remember, folks, the number of infections reported is a fraction of the number of infections
[1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:38.160]  that exist.
[1:34:38.160 --> 1:34:41.800]  Now, we've got Dave Hodges here from the commonsenseshow.com.
[1:34:41.800 --> 1:34:44.320]  Just for this segment, we've got a special report coming up.
[1:34:44.320 --> 1:34:48.760]  This segment, Alex Jones interviews the son of the president of Brazil, and the son's
[1:34:48.760 --> 1:34:54.040]  name is Eduardo, excuse me, Bolsonaro, and that's a bombshell interview.
[1:34:54.040 --> 1:34:55.240]  I can't wait to see it.
[1:34:55.240 --> 1:35:01.160]  But Dave, you've got, I don't know if, I know you're aware of some things that you
[1:35:01.160 --> 1:35:05.080]  haven't yet made public, but, and I'm not going to spill the beans here, but something
[1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:10.120]  you told me yesterday, is that something that you could make public about quarantine personnel
[1:35:10.120 --> 1:35:12.520]  or is that, can we not go there yet?
[1:35:12.520 --> 1:35:16.000]  Elaborate a little bit more, because I'm not quite sure what you're referring to.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:17.200]  Yeah, sure you're not, Dave.
[1:35:17.200 --> 1:35:18.200]  That's funny.
[1:35:18.200 --> 1:35:24.140]  No, listen, I'm going to answer anything you want, because it's time to put all the
[1:35:24.140 --> 1:35:25.140]  cards on the table.
[1:35:25.140 --> 1:35:30.280]  Okay, I'm talking about the personnel that are going to work in the quarantine centers
[1:35:30.280 --> 1:35:35.560]  and the numbers that are exploding of those personnel, federal personnel, which means,
[1:35:35.560 --> 1:35:39.320]  by inference, the number of people in quarantine is huge.
[1:35:39.320 --> 1:35:41.280]  You've got some intel on that.
[1:35:41.280 --> 1:35:44.680]  They've got, we've got quarantine centers already set up.
[1:35:44.680 --> 1:35:50.280]  And it's nice how you can have dual use facilities, such as, you know, what we call FEMA camps.
[1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:55.560]  And I was first reported on this five and a half years ago in October of 2014.
[1:35:55.560 --> 1:36:01.240]  And I wrote a piece and I introduced a document that was aimed between HHS, Human Health Services,
[1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:03.920]  and the United Nations called EFS number eight.
[1:36:03.920 --> 1:36:06.560]  And incidentally, Mike is really interesting.
[1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:12.080]  In the president's briefing, he had a lady from the CDC speaking and she said under EFS
[1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:16.880]  number eight, and I almost fell out of my chair, because what this means is they bring
[1:36:16.880 --> 1:36:22.560]  in all the former executive orders from Obama and George W. Bush, where you much have a
[1:36:22.560 --> 1:36:24.240]  sniffle, a sneeze.
[1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:27.720]  They can grab you off the street and send you to one of these camps.
[1:36:27.720 --> 1:36:29.320]  And here's what's frightening about the camps.
[1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:32.640]  There's two elements here that I want to make sure that I cover.
[1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:35.200]  Number one, you're not leaving that camp.
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:40.600]  They have 17 organizations associated with these medical martial law FEMA camps.
[1:36:40.600 --> 1:36:44.760]  And in them, they have not one medical treatment group.
[1:36:44.760 --> 1:36:47.600]  The closest they come is the Red Cross, which delivers supplies.
[1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:49.760]  It does not provide medical treatment.
[1:36:49.760 --> 1:36:53.800]  Everything else is intelligence or law enforcement agencies like the FDI.
[1:36:53.800 --> 1:36:54.920]  So they're not hospitals.
[1:36:54.920 --> 1:36:55.920]  This is the same situation.
[1:36:55.920 --> 1:36:56.920]  They're not.
[1:36:56.920 --> 1:36:57.920]  They're not hospitals.
[1:36:57.920 --> 1:36:59.640]  They're basically just quarantine death camps.
[1:36:59.640 --> 1:37:00.640]  Yeah.
[1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:01.640]  They're hospices for the public.
[1:37:01.640 --> 1:37:02.640]  Exactly.
[1:37:02.640 --> 1:37:03.640]  Wow.
[1:37:03.640 --> 1:37:09.760]  And number two is from FM39.4, and Doug Hagman and I both broke this about six years ago.
[1:37:09.760 --> 1:37:14.720]  But under this, it's basically the Army Field Manual for the maintenance and running of
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:15.720]  FEMA camps.
[1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:18.720]  Now, this will have special relevance, because I think it links into China and how they're
[1:37:18.720 --> 1:37:20.480]  handling dead bodies.
[1:37:20.480 --> 1:37:27.040]  But under the martial law provisions of FEMA camps in FM39.4, they make it clear that they're
[1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:30.520]  going to turn the running of these camps over to foreign nationals.
[1:37:30.520 --> 1:37:34.080]  I think that's because they'll be willing to do things to American citizens that you
[1:37:34.080 --> 1:37:35.400]  wouldn't otherwise do.
[1:37:35.400 --> 1:37:40.280]  And they have details in there about when you eat, how you eat, how you march to work,
[1:37:40.280 --> 1:37:43.880]  it's labor camps, it's basically slave labor to a large extent.
[1:37:43.880 --> 1:37:45.600]  But here's the interesting thing, Mike.
[1:37:45.600 --> 1:37:50.920]  The one thing they leave out is the disposition of dead bodies, like no one's ever going to
[1:37:50.920 --> 1:37:52.200]  have a heart attack.
[1:37:52.200 --> 1:37:54.640]  No one's ever going to get cancer and die from that.
[1:37:54.640 --> 1:37:59.000]  They don't have anything in there in the midst of all these details about dead bodies.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:03.840]  And I think what we're looking at here is what we see in China, the introduction of
[1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:06.320]  incinerators.
[1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:12.360]  So basically, if you go to one of these camps, you're dead, or very high probability of dying.
[1:38:12.360 --> 1:38:15.840]  If you manage to survive, they might let you out at some point, but for the most part,
[1:38:15.840 --> 1:38:16.840]  you're dead.
[1:38:16.840 --> 1:38:18.720]  And these are what Hillary called fun camps, right?
[1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:19.720]  Correct.
[1:38:19.720 --> 1:38:21.200]  Hillary's fun camps.
[1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:25.400]  How much fun is it going to be to be thrown into an incinerator oven?
[1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:29.560]  China has put in another order, I heard, for more incinerators because they've been using
[1:38:29.560 --> 1:38:30.780]  the ones they have so much.
[1:38:30.780 --> 1:38:33.040]  Some of them are breaking down.
[1:38:33.040 --> 1:38:35.480]  So they have an expansion of incinerators.
[1:38:35.480 --> 1:38:37.640]  Dave, I know you've got a lot more to say.
[1:38:37.640 --> 1:38:42.360]  Look, we have a special report from Alex, an interview coming up for the next segment.
[1:38:42.360 --> 1:38:46.120]  Can you stay over that segment and join us for five minutes at the top of the next hour
[1:38:46.120 --> 1:38:47.120]  or two?
[1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:48.120]  Sure.
[1:38:48.120 --> 1:38:49.120]  I'd be happy to.
[1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:50.120]  Okay.
[1:38:50.120 --> 1:38:51.120]  Then go ahead and continue.
[1:38:51.120 --> 1:38:52.120]  Don't let me interrupt.
[1:38:52.120 --> 1:38:53.120]  You get a lot of intel.
[1:38:53.120 --> 1:38:54.120]  Go ahead.
[1:38:54.120 --> 1:38:57.640]  And then what I'm saying here is not wild-eyed conspiracy theory.
[1:38:57.640 --> 1:39:00.360]  EFS, number eight, it's a PDF.
[1:39:00.360 --> 1:39:03.000]  You can still access it online as of last week.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:08.040]  The other thing that we know, Mike, is that you've got FM39.4, and it's been published
[1:39:08.040 --> 1:39:11.140]  probably in 10,000 locations at this point.
[1:39:11.140 --> 1:39:13.200]  So there's documentation for what you're saying.
[1:39:13.200 --> 1:39:16.760]  The other thing I was starting to talk about as we went into the last break, and I wanted
[1:39:16.760 --> 1:39:20.560]  to finish this thought, you made a really astute statement.
[1:39:20.560 --> 1:39:24.200]  You and Alex both did about, you know, we now have more testing, and what are they going
[1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:25.200]  to do with the results?
[1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:27.440]  We want to ask Dave about this when he comes on.
[1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:35.200]  Well, in the publication market watch on February 21st, they identify a $445 million
[1:39:35.200 --> 1:39:40.480]  bond fund, both Class A and Class B, and it's basically insurance against pandemics.
[1:39:40.480 --> 1:39:42.880]  Now, here's the interesting thing.
[1:39:42.880 --> 1:39:47.200]  If no pandemic is declared, the people that have bought insurance, presumably the medical
[1:39:47.200 --> 1:39:50.720]  facilities of nation states, they get money back.
[1:39:50.720 --> 1:39:54.240]  There's another group that if the money's paid out, they get 7%.
[1:39:54.240 --> 1:39:58.520]  So there's like competition for the same pool of money for a declared pandemic.
[1:39:58.520 --> 1:40:00.280]  One side wants it, one side doesn't.
[1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:05.680]  So do you think this is why the WHO is refraining from using the word pandemic?
[1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:07.600]  Yes, exactly.
[1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:10.920]  Because the due date for these bonds, there's two classifications here.
[1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:16.720]  One is a $320 million fund that comes due in July of this year.
[1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:21.160]  And I think that what we're going to see is underreporting, and this is why I think the
[1:40:21.160 --> 1:40:25.000]  president's taking the position he's taking, especially too, because he's also protecting
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  the economy from the fears of a downturn with health and basically the BDI stopping.
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.040]  That's probably another topic for another day.
[1:40:34.040 --> 1:40:38.520]  But in reality, Mike, what we're looking at here is money is driving the reporting.
[1:40:38.520 --> 1:40:39.520]  That's what I'm saying.
[1:40:39.520 --> 1:40:44.160]  And then people can access this report online by just typing in market watch and go to February
[1:40:44.160 --> 1:40:45.320]  21st for that article.
[1:40:45.320 --> 1:40:48.320]  Yeah, they brought up that article while you were talking.
[1:40:48.320 --> 1:40:49.320]  This is fascinating.
[1:40:49.320 --> 1:40:55.600]  So not only do we have then people invested in both sides of the outcome here, but also
[1:40:55.600 --> 1:41:01.640]  just on the economic supply side, we've seen there's a glut of oil now because China is
[1:41:01.640 --> 1:41:03.640]  not using as much energy.
[1:41:03.640 --> 1:41:08.000]  We've seen copper prices plummet because China is not using as much copper, which is a common
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:09.920]  ingredient in semiconductors.
[1:41:09.920 --> 1:41:15.160]  We are seeing a glut of a lot of the supply side and then extreme scarcity in products
[1:41:15.160 --> 1:41:19.160]  that are normally produced from these inputs of energy and minerals and so on.
[1:41:19.160 --> 1:41:24.640]  So how would you describe this supply chain crisis that now emerges?
[1:41:24.640 --> 1:41:25.840]  We're just beginning to see it.
[1:41:25.840 --> 1:41:27.200]  It's going to get a lot worse.
[1:41:27.200 --> 1:41:29.000]  What are your thoughts on the economic consequences?
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  Mike, that's a really good question.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:36.240]  And I think without even considering the fact that this virus could indeed go pandemic or
[1:41:36.240 --> 1:41:41.760]  has gone pandemic, even without that variable, what we are looking at now is because it's
[1:41:41.760 --> 1:41:45.320]  hit China so hard and China is the number two economy in the world.
[1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:46.320]  You can't help it.
[1:41:46.320 --> 1:41:47.320]  It's going to have a bad effect.
[1:41:47.320 --> 1:41:51.400]  And I'll just point to one statistic and then I'll talk about the offshoot.
[1:41:51.400 --> 1:41:56.280]  The statistic is that three times now in the past two weeks, the Baltic dry index, which
[1:41:56.280 --> 1:42:02.040]  measures the volume of global trade, has hit the lowest level in recorded history.
[1:42:02.040 --> 1:42:06.000]  That means goods and services associated with global trade are not moving.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:10.640]  So what it means for America is since our economy is intertwined with the Chinese and
[1:42:10.640 --> 1:42:13.480]  they produce most of our medications, we're going to have real trouble.
[1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:14.480]  What is it?
[1:42:14.480 --> 1:42:17.520]  95, 97% of all antibiotics come out of China.
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:21.000]  We're going to see these spot shortages and I'm encouraging everyone right now hearing
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:26.520]  my voice to contact their medical professionals and ask if their medicine is going to be available
[1:42:26.520 --> 1:42:28.720]  and ask for how they can validate that information.
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:30.160]  Okay, Dave, stay with us.
[1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:31.160]  We've got to go to break.
[1:42:31.160 --> 1:42:34.480]  On the other side of this break, we've got the interview between Alex Jones and Eduardo
[1:42:34.480 --> 1:42:39.720]  Bolsonaro, the son of the president of Brazil, who is a big fan of not only Trump, but of
[1:42:39.720 --> 1:42:41.960]  Alex Jones and this program.
[1:42:41.960 --> 1:42:44.040]  And then we'll be back with Dave on the other side of that.
[1:42:44.040 --> 1:42:45.040]  So stay with us.
[1:42:45.040 --> 1:42:48.120]  There's a lot still coming up here today bombshell after bombshell.
[1:42:48.120 --> 1:42:50.760]  You're watching the Alex Jones show, Mike Adams filling in.
[1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:51.760]  Stay with us.
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:52.760]  We'll be right back.
[1:42:52.760 --> 1:43:01.720]  I don't sell firearms, but I promote them constantly.
[1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:05.160]  Now can somebody listen to me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong?
[1:43:05.160 --> 1:43:06.160]  Yeah.
[1:43:06.160 --> 1:43:07.360]  Just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man.
[1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:08.360]  I love women.
[1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:09.920]  You ought to go out and get a girlfriend.
[1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:11.280]  You may have problems with her.
[1:43:11.280 --> 1:43:12.560]  You may get a divorce.
[1:43:12.560 --> 1:43:13.560]  You may whatever.
[1:43:13.560 --> 1:43:17.440]  The point is, I'm just steering you in the direction I went that was successful when
[1:43:17.440 --> 1:43:18.440]  I left.
[1:43:18.440 --> 1:43:23.280]  Well, when it comes to supplements and when it comes to storeable foods, we've got the

[1:43:44.560 --> 1:43:45.560]  sales.
[1:43:45.560 --> 1:43:48.040]  We've sold out just like we've done with supplements and other things.

[1:43:55.760 --> 1:43:59.840]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness and that we're
[1:43:59.840 --> 1:44:04.000]  seeing record food sales not just here but across the world.
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:05.000]  That's good.
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:06.880]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[1:44:06.880 --> 1:44:12.200]  The average person is living hand to mouth paycheck to paycheck and doesn't even know
[1:44:12.200 --> 1:44:13.840]  how to change their tire.
[1:44:13.840 --> 1:44:18.680]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared and that means even with just the
[1:44:18.680 --> 1:44:23.560]  basics, even a three week food supply that you know is always there that you only go
[1:44:23.560 --> 1:44:25.200]  to in emergencies.
[1:44:25.200 --> 1:44:30.320]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical or even more so.

[1:44:56.720 --> 1:44:59.560]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.
[1:44:59.560 --> 1:45:06.560]  Ultra 12 and Vitamin Rfusion are both back in stock after being sold out for months.
[1:45:06.560 --> 1:45:11.520]  Vitamin Rfusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids and other key cofactors

[1:47:31.840 --> 1:47:32.840]  Sir God bless you.
[1:47:32.840 --> 1:47:33.840]  Thanks for giving us a few minutes.
[1:47:33.840 --> 1:47:34.840]  Thank you.
[1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:35.840]  I really appreciate it.
[1:47:35.840 --> 1:47:36.840]  Thank you.
[1:47:36.840 --> 1:47:37.840]  Here, let's carry on.
[1:47:37.840 --> 1:47:38.840]  Maybe a little background.
[1:47:38.840 --> 1:47:39.840]  Let's go this way.
[1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:44.840]  Well, here we are with the son of the Brazilian president who's a real maverick.
[1:47:44.840 --> 1:47:51.840]  Really only, second only to Trump promoting nationalism, God, family, country, and of
[1:47:51.840 --> 1:47:56.840]  course they tried to murder him, stab him, but he's won the presidency and he's really
[1:47:56.840 --> 1:48:00.320]  caused a rebirth in Brazil and his son is here at CPAC.
[1:48:00.320 --> 1:48:03.520]  This is really a great, epic moment and we're so blessed to talk to you, sir.
[1:48:03.520 --> 1:48:04.520]  I say thank you for the opportunity, Alex.
[1:48:04.520 --> 1:48:05.520]  Big fan of yours.
[1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:06.520]  You don't even know.
[1:48:06.520 --> 1:48:07.520]  But a couple of years ago, I sent an email for you.
[1:48:07.520 --> 1:48:08.520]  Drawing should be.
[1:48:08.520 --> 1:48:15.520]  The Info Wars guy in Brazil.
[1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:21.520]  Well, we wish we'd have got that email, we're small, we're small.
[1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:23.960]  No, no, no, you're great, you're great.
[1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:28.400]  So tell us about the relationship between Trump, Info Wars and just the ideas in Brazil
[1:48:28.400 --> 1:48:31.960]  and what was already there, what your father stands for in the fights he's been through.
[1:48:31.960 --> 1:48:35.520]  If you want to know, he's a champion, a lion with hyenas around him.
[1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:39.840]  Yeah, we are, for sure, we are together, not only in trade, but also in the future issue,
[1:48:39.840 --> 1:48:46.000]  fighting against all of those globalism that we're trying to bring to our countries, universal
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  kind of government.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:52.640]  So it's what is happening by the United Nations, by the European Union as you can see in the
[1:48:52.640 --> 1:48:54.640]  present and now we are reacting.
[1:48:54.640 --> 1:49:00.840]  We are showing to the people that we, conservatives, we that once we have a family and all of that,
[1:49:00.840 --> 1:49:01.840]  that we have a voice.
[1:49:01.840 --> 1:49:07.760]  We have a voice with Trump, we have a voice with Jay Bolsonaro and we have the most tolerant
[1:49:07.760 --> 1:49:08.760]  guys.
[1:49:08.760 --> 1:49:15.480]  I mean, when you talk about this tab that my father got attacked during the election period,
[1:49:15.480 --> 1:49:23.240]  the election time, much of the press, they don't say that this tab was made by a former
[1:49:23.240 --> 1:49:28.280]  member of the Socialism and Liberty Party in Brazil.
[1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:29.280]  So extreme left.
[1:49:29.280 --> 1:49:31.280]  They don't even use extreme left.
[1:49:31.280 --> 1:49:34.560]  They don't use extreme right or far, far, far right.
[1:49:34.560 --> 1:49:41.200]  So we are the mass guys to kill Brazil going on the way of the freedom and of the prosperity.
[1:49:41.200 --> 1:49:42.800]  And thanks God, we are in a very good scene.
[1:49:42.800 --> 1:49:43.800]  Let's speak to that.
[1:49:43.800 --> 1:49:47.720]  Bernie Sanders campaign people all over the tapes saying they want to put people in camps.
[1:49:47.720 --> 1:49:48.720]  They want to kill everybody.
[1:49:48.720 --> 1:49:49.720]  That's what communists do.
[1:49:49.720 --> 1:49:53.760]  Your father was almost killed by socialists, by communists, and when they attack, when
[1:49:53.760 --> 1:49:57.120]  they shoot members of Congress like Scalise, they will not say anything.
[1:49:57.120 --> 1:49:58.120]  Yes.
[1:49:58.120 --> 1:49:59.600]  I mean, these people are violent.
[1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:00.600]  Yes.
[1:50:00.600 --> 1:50:01.600]  They are really violent.
[1:50:01.600 --> 1:50:03.600]  And they really support each other.
[1:50:03.600 --> 1:50:08.720]  Like, it's crazy how they don't talk a lot about it, but if we say something that they
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:13.920]  can see, that they can get a word and tell that, you know, this guy is, he won a dictatorship
[1:50:13.920 --> 1:50:20.440]  in Brazil, which is a real lie, they support, they give this voice everywhere.
[1:50:20.440 --> 1:50:21.440]  So we have to be connected.
[1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:28.480]  We have to be supporting each other to fight back against these fake news times.
[1:50:28.480 --> 1:50:33.960]  What would you call this global wave of nationalism, of reconnecting with God and family?
[1:50:33.960 --> 1:50:34.960]  What would you call this wave?
[1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:35.960]  Because it's getting stronger.
[1:50:35.960 --> 1:50:40.000]  As you said with Brexit and everything else is happening, how far do you think this will
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:42.600]  go and how will the forces of globalism strike back?
[1:50:42.600 --> 1:50:43.600]  It's very hard.
[1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:49.480]  If you take a look in Chile, you are seeing how the leftists are trying to fight back
[1:50:49.480 --> 1:50:50.480]  against Minera.
[1:50:50.480 --> 1:50:55.720]  In Brazil, it's not happening now, and the best thing to fight against it is cutting
[1:50:55.720 --> 1:50:56.720]  their money.
[1:50:56.720 --> 1:51:01.760]  If you cut their money, they are very smart when they create the easy tools to receive
[1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:02.760]  the money.
[1:51:02.760 --> 1:51:07.240]  They don't have any kind of moral to send money to these kind of people.
[1:51:07.240 --> 1:51:12.600]  Brazil, when we had Juma Rosetta and Lula da Silva in Brazil as presidents, they were
[1:51:12.600 --> 1:51:19.280]  giving our money from a Republican man called BNDES to build a party Cuba, to build Subway
[1:51:19.280 --> 1:51:22.160]  Venezuela, and they never pay us back.
[1:51:22.160 --> 1:51:23.160]  So this is social.
[1:51:23.160 --> 1:51:28.720]  If you want to try Bernie Sanders, you don't even have to imagine about the facts.
[1:51:28.720 --> 1:51:33.440]  Look to Brazil, look to Venezuela where they are going, and don't think that this is something
[1:51:33.440 --> 1:51:35.440]  far away from your reality.
[1:51:35.440 --> 1:51:41.960]  Because during the magnetists, if you talk to any Venezuela, that Venezuela would have
[1:51:41.960 --> 1:51:47.120]  a dictatorship in this way that they are having with Maduro, no one would believe in that.
[1:51:47.120 --> 1:51:51.560]  So please vote for Trump.
[1:51:51.560 --> 1:51:55.080]  Any other questions you would like to make, I just want to speak about the fact that communism
[1:51:55.080 --> 1:51:59.280]  never works except for the establishment, and if you turn it into the news about Trump
[1:51:59.280 --> 1:52:02.760]  or your father, it's nothing but negative, but when you see nothing but negative, you
[1:52:02.760 --> 1:52:03.760]  know that person is good.
[1:52:03.760 --> 1:52:09.120]  I think people finally, at least a large portion of people, a majority now get laid, but all
[1:52:09.120 --> 1:52:14.320]  I see is negative, someone must be good, and I don't know how the media has lost its power
[1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:17.200]  to raise skin, is going to survive now.
[1:52:17.200 --> 1:52:19.720]  They tried to censor us, but that's not working either.
[1:52:19.720 --> 1:52:24.160]  It seems like they are losing on every front, and their whole deep state operations are
[1:52:24.160 --> 1:52:25.160]  failing.
[1:52:25.160 --> 1:52:26.160]  What are you going to do next?
[1:52:26.160 --> 1:52:29.520]  I think there are going to be some of them, for sure, that are going to fail, and I think
[1:52:29.520 --> 1:52:35.720]  that more and more channels as info or other independent channels, they are going to start
[1:52:35.720 --> 1:52:36.720]  to grow up.
[1:52:36.720 --> 1:52:38.440]  I think this is what is going to happen.
[1:52:38.440 --> 1:52:43.520]  We are in the Internet era, that's why they are crazy trying to control the Internet.
[1:52:43.520 --> 1:52:44.520]  I agree.
[1:52:44.520 --> 1:52:47.800]  Any other points just about the epic fight your father is in, President Trump, and what
[1:52:47.800 --> 1:52:48.800]  you see in the future?
[1:52:48.800 --> 1:52:51.320]  I see the future prosperity.
[1:52:51.320 --> 1:52:57.840]  We are only in the first year under Bolsonaro gopernanda in Brazil, and we reduced, in 20%
[1:52:57.840 --> 1:53:03.760]  in the first year, we reduced in 20% the number of the murders.
[1:53:03.760 --> 1:53:05.480]  We are not in a recession anymore.
[1:53:05.480 --> 1:53:11.080]  Brazil, we grew up a little bit more than 1% last year, and also generates a little bit
[1:53:11.080 --> 1:53:13.240]  more than 1 million jobs.
[1:53:13.240 --> 1:53:18.120]  So this is the right way, and I think if we keep going, we will never go back anymore
[1:53:18.120 --> 1:53:19.120]  to a socialism system.
[1:53:19.120 --> 1:53:23.120]  And thanks for your support of Israel, too, and moving the embassy to Israel is so great.
[1:53:23.120 --> 1:53:24.120]  We are studying that.
[1:53:24.120 --> 1:53:28.120]  Not sure if this year, if it's up to me, this year we are going to move the embassy to
[1:53:28.120 --> 1:53:29.120]  Brazil.
[1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:33.840]  But President Bolsonaro said that the maximum next year is going to do that.
[1:53:33.840 --> 1:53:37.600]  So your father is getting stronger, while the globalists are getting weaker?
[1:53:37.600 --> 1:53:38.600]  Yes, sure, yes.
[1:53:38.600 --> 1:53:39.600]  You can feel that.
[1:53:39.600 --> 1:53:43.440]  But the people have to know this is a total war.
[1:53:43.440 --> 1:53:46.480]  People need to go directly to what your father and others have to say.
[1:53:46.480 --> 1:53:50.120]  What is the best place to find what he actually says, to find out why he's so attacked?
[1:53:50.120 --> 1:53:52.120]  It's his social media.
[1:53:52.120 --> 1:53:54.040]  Forget about the mainstream media.
[1:53:54.040 --> 1:53:58.640]  If you look to the mainstream media in Brazil, it's the same that I say to you that watch
[1:53:58.640 --> 1:53:59.640]  CNN.
[1:53:59.640 --> 1:54:00.640]  No, no, no.
[1:54:00.640 --> 1:54:01.640]  Don't watch CNN.
[1:54:01.640 --> 1:54:02.640]  Go read the book.
[1:54:02.640 --> 1:54:08.920]  Get a nice book to do that, or if you want real information, you go to the independent
[1:54:08.920 --> 1:54:09.920]  channels or to the...
[1:54:09.920 --> 1:54:12.720]  And by the way, they're even trying to ban Trump off Twitter now.
[1:54:12.720 --> 1:54:15.760]  I know they talked about trying to restrict your father, so the people have been banned.
[1:54:15.760 --> 1:54:16.760]  I know he's...
[1:54:16.760 --> 1:54:19.760]  Is your father going to stand up against big tech censorship?
[1:54:19.760 --> 1:54:23.920]  This is an interesting case, like, we need other channels too.
[1:54:23.920 --> 1:54:27.040]  We are strong in social media, but you're right Alex.
[1:54:27.040 --> 1:54:29.200]  We don't know how much longer it will take.
[1:54:29.200 --> 1:54:33.400]  If it's for Joseph Watson and all the other guys, especially the small conservative ones
[1:54:33.400 --> 1:54:39.000]  that have a channel in the social media, sometimes they just block them and that's how.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:40.800]  And no one even knows that.
[1:54:40.800 --> 1:54:41.800]  Well, you're doing a great job.
[1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:42.800]  Tell your dad and keep it up.
[1:54:42.800 --> 1:54:43.800]  He's a real inspiration.
[1:54:43.800 --> 1:54:46.240]  I love him all over the world, like Nigel Farage and others.
[1:54:46.240 --> 1:54:47.240]  Thank you so much, sir.
[1:54:47.240 --> 1:54:48.240]  Thank you.
[1:54:48.240 --> 1:54:49.240]  I appreciate it.
[1:54:49.240 --> 1:54:50.240]  All right, folks.
[1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:51.240]  Amazing interview.
[1:54:51.240 --> 1:54:52.240]  There we go.
[1:54:52.240 --> 1:54:55.880]  That was just a fascinating interview with Eduardo Bolsonaro from Brazil.
[1:54:55.880 --> 1:54:57.240]  He's the son of the president of Brazil.
[1:54:57.240 --> 1:54:58.240]  Really cool guy.
[1:54:58.240 --> 1:54:59.240]  That was a great interview.
[1:54:59.240 --> 1:55:05.040]  We really appreciate all the things that Alex is doing to get those interviews and the success
[1:55:05.040 --> 1:55:07.360]  of, well, nationalism.
[1:55:07.360 --> 1:55:13.160]  That is, having faith and pride in your own country and building your country to be strong.
[1:55:13.160 --> 1:55:16.920]  We're now seeing the collapse of globalism because of the situation in China right now
[1:55:16.920 --> 1:55:21.840]  and the drawbacks of having supply lines that depend on some communist nation providing
[1:55:21.840 --> 1:55:23.560]  your products.
[1:55:23.560 --> 1:55:24.720]  That's not working.
[1:55:24.720 --> 1:55:26.080]  Trump needs to take advantage of this.
[1:55:26.080 --> 1:55:29.360]  We're going to continue with Dave Hodges right now here and also we'll have him into
[1:55:29.360 --> 1:55:30.360]  the next segment.
[1:55:30.360 --> 1:55:33.240]  I've got a question for Dave going into this.
[1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:39.360]  President Trump is now reported to be on the verge of invoking the Defense Production Act,
[1:55:39.360 --> 1:55:43.640]  which would allow him to essentially order certain manufacturers or to, you could say,
[1:55:43.640 --> 1:55:50.200]  aid them to allow them, perhaps with government funding or loans or what have you, to produce
[1:55:50.200 --> 1:55:53.960]  more medical supplies and materials in the United States.
[1:55:53.960 --> 1:55:58.720]  But even though this may be a good move right now, maybe it's necessary, but isn't it interesting
[1:55:58.720 --> 1:56:05.120]  that we're starting to see elements of central command and control economy now here in the
[1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:06.120]  United States?
[1:56:06.120 --> 1:56:07.520]  Is this a good thing or a bad thing, Dave?
[1:56:07.520 --> 1:56:09.720]  Well, I think it's a responsible thing.
[1:56:09.720 --> 1:56:13.440]  I don't have any information that confirms this, but it's kind of interesting.
[1:56:13.440 --> 1:56:17.240]  This is a light, I think it's Section 201, but I'd stand corrected on that perhaps,
[1:56:17.240 --> 1:56:22.960]  that Executive Order 13603 that came out of Obama that basically said he could take over
[1:56:22.960 --> 1:56:25.440]  any business and do anything he wanted with it.
[1:56:25.440 --> 1:56:28.720]  Also, it's a continuity of government provision as well, too.
[1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:32.120]  So the President has the authority to do this legitimately.
[1:56:32.120 --> 1:56:35.960]  And I think it's a good move if he is doing it, particularly in light of the fact that
[1:56:35.960 --> 1:56:40.760]  China controls so much of our medication distribution that we can have people with chronic conditions
[1:56:40.760 --> 1:56:43.160]  and real trouble here in short order.
[1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:45.440]  So I would expect this to be true, yes.
[1:56:45.440 --> 1:56:50.520]  But ultimately, if we're going to have products made in America because American workers are
[1:56:50.520 --> 1:56:57.080]  paid a lot more than Chinese workers, and America has better environmental regulations,
[1:56:57.080 --> 1:57:01.800]  you could say, or companies are more environmentally responsible than Chinese companies, which basically
[1:57:01.800 --> 1:57:05.840]  completely ignore all regulations, products made in America will be more expensive than
[1:57:05.840 --> 1:57:06.840]  products made in China.
[1:57:06.840 --> 1:57:08.360]  There's no way around it.
[1:57:08.360 --> 1:57:10.640]  So are Americans willing to pay more?
[1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:15.400]  And also on the flip side, what's the real cost of chasing the lowest price?
[1:57:15.400 --> 1:57:20.520]  The Walmart China price has put us in this situation where we are right now with supply
[1:57:20.520 --> 1:57:26.120]  lines collapsing, shortages coming in pharmaceuticals, in consumer products, in smartphones, and
[1:57:26.120 --> 1:57:27.120]  much more.
[1:57:27.120 --> 1:57:31.240]  So hold on, we'll answer that in two minutes with Dave Hodges on the other side of this
[1:57:31.240 --> 1:57:32.240]  break.
[1:57:32.240 --> 1:57:39.240]  If you like Addams here with Infowars.com, stay with us, more answers straight ahead.
[1:57:39.240 --> 1:57:53.760]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins, there are many reasons why we need to think
[1:57:53.760 --> 1:57:56.360]  about what is really in the air around us.
[1:57:56.360 --> 1:58:00.800]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:06.240]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against
[1:58:06.240 --> 1:58:09.200]  the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.
[1:58:09.200 --> 1:58:14.680]  Powerful, quiet, and effective, the breeze uses a four-step purification process to help
[1:58:14.680 --> 1:58:17.080]  you breathe easier and cleaner.
[1:58:17.080 --> 1:58:21.560]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars, but the Alexa Pure Breeze

[1:58:46.560 --> 1:58:51.480]  There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world, a lot of people that never deliver.
[1:58:51.480 --> 1:58:58.760]  Well, I'm here to tell you, Infowars has delivered in royal flush, in a handful of ace
[1:58:58.760 --> 1:59:03.680]  of spades, because of God, because of the audience of activists, and because of the
[1:59:03.680 --> 1:59:08.680]  great team at Infowars, and we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:59:08.680 --> 1:59:13.400]  So right now, humanity's awakening is explosive, it's powerful, it's incredible.
[1:59:13.400 --> 1:59:17.760]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road, and the only way we can effectively
[1:59:17.760 --> 1:59:22.640]  fight the NWO and stay in the game on Infowars is to tip the spear, is your financial support,
[1:59:22.640 --> 1:59:25.120]  we make it really easy, at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:59:25.120 --> 1:59:31.160]  But I am blowing through our backup money right now, with our reporters doing triple
[1:59:31.160 --> 1:59:35.120]  the work they ever have, because they volunteered to do it, and Owen and the rest of the crew
[1:59:35.120 --> 1:59:40.000]  will fight 18 hours a day, 7 days a week, during this election year that's so critical
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:43.000]  that they need the financing to put them in the field.
[1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:50.000]  Go to InfowarsStore.com and fight for your own future.
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:27.080]  It's Mike Adams, filling in for Alex Jones, and we've got Dave Hodges for this segment
[2:00:27.080 --> 2:00:32.400]  followed by an interview with James Lyons-Wiler on the other side of this, again just back-to-back
[2:00:32.400 --> 2:00:33.920]  bombshell intel today.
[2:00:33.920 --> 2:00:37.400]  I'm going to give Dave a lot of time to talk in this segment, this is the last segment
[2:00:37.400 --> 2:00:42.400]  we're having today, but the question was what about the supply chain disruption, and can
[2:00:42.400 --> 2:00:47.080]  we even structure society where Americans are willing to pay the higher prices for American
[2:00:47.080 --> 2:00:51.360]  made goods so that we can have more of a redundant, domestic supply chain of manufacturing?
[2:00:51.360 --> 2:00:53.640]  Dave, your thoughts on that, go ahead, sir.
[2:00:53.640 --> 2:00:58.080]  My great fear here is that, no, not in time for the election.
[2:00:58.080 --> 2:01:03.600]  I think what's going to happen with the coronavirus and the economic fallout could be minimized
[2:01:03.600 --> 2:01:09.760]  to some degree, but you're talking about a long-term transitional change from manufacturing
[2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:13.920]  in China to here, and you just don't flip a switch and have that happen.
[2:01:13.920 --> 2:01:17.960]  The President's trip to India, I believe, was to replace China as the number two economy
[2:01:17.960 --> 2:01:22.200]  in South India, and this is why we're trying to get them to lower their tariffs so we can
[2:01:22.200 --> 2:01:27.640]  start these same business relationships we have in China, but that's a long-term process.
[2:01:27.640 --> 2:01:32.080]  That's a three- to five-year process, so no, I think we're going to have serious economic
[2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:38.200]  fallout, and our work in the independent media, the truth media, is going to be to convince
[2:01:38.200 --> 2:01:44.040]  the American public that this was a contrived event, it's a bio-weapon, China's complicit
[2:01:44.040 --> 2:01:45.880]  in the spreading of this bio-weapon.
[2:01:45.880 --> 2:01:49.840]  It facilitates their depopulation aims for their own people.
[2:01:49.840 --> 2:01:54.240]  It really installs them as a global policeman for reasons we don't have to get into.
[2:01:54.240 --> 2:01:58.400]  I'll refer you to the two parts of a three-part article series that I'm writing on The Common
[2:01:58.400 --> 2:02:02.960]  Sense Show that talks about how do we know the Chinese did it on purpose, and also, too,
[2:02:02.960 --> 2:02:04.480]  I'm going to maintain this.
[2:02:04.480 --> 2:02:08.800]  Alexandra Daley, one of our researchers, and I are working on a story that shows that
[2:02:08.800 --> 2:02:15.560]  Hunter Biden not only facilitated transfer of F-35 technology to the Chai comms in 2015,
[2:02:15.560 --> 2:02:19.720]  but also the delivery of bio-weapons, and we contend this is what was released.
[2:02:19.720 --> 2:02:22.840]  Okay, wait, wait, you just dropped major bomb shows.
[2:02:22.840 --> 2:02:28.080]  You just said Hunter Biden facilitated the transfer of F-35 military technology to China
[2:02:28.080 --> 2:02:30.280]  as well as biological weapons technology to China.
[2:02:30.280 --> 2:02:35.280]  Is that what you just said?
[2:02:35.280 --> 2:02:36.280]  He just got cut off.
[2:02:36.280 --> 2:02:37.280]  We just lost.
[2:02:37.280 --> 2:02:38.280]  See, look at that.
[2:02:38.280 --> 2:02:39.280]  Wow.
[2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:40.280]  What an amazing coincidence.
[2:02:40.280 --> 2:02:41.280]  Sensitive question.
[2:02:41.280 --> 2:02:42.280]  Boom.
[2:02:42.280 --> 2:02:43.280]  Just gone.
[2:02:43.280 --> 2:02:44.280]  But I believe I heard that correctly.
[2:02:44.280 --> 2:02:45.280]  Oh, he's back.
[2:02:45.280 --> 2:02:46.280]  I'm here.
[2:02:46.280 --> 2:02:47.280]  Yeah.
[2:02:47.280 --> 2:02:49.920]  It's interesting that we cut out at that exact moment.
[2:02:49.920 --> 2:02:50.920]  Isn't it?
[2:02:50.920 --> 2:02:51.920]  Yes.
[2:02:51.920 --> 2:02:56.080]  Listen, I'm telling you, the Senate knows what I know.
[2:02:56.080 --> 2:03:01.440]  The day of acquittal, Senators Grassley and Johnson launched inquiries into Hunter Biden's
[2:03:01.440 --> 2:03:05.640]  travels to Ukraine and China, and here's the kicker.
[2:03:05.640 --> 2:03:10.640]  They wanted to know if it was on Air Force One or Air Force Two, and that would mean
[2:03:10.640 --> 2:03:16.000]  either Obama's complicit or Biden's complicit, I mean Biden's complicit, Joe Biden, or both
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:21.640]  of them, and I'm maintaining that those bio-weapons had to end up in China's hands externally
[2:03:21.640 --> 2:03:25.080]  because they did not have the expertise, and this is from everybody I talked to that
[2:03:25.080 --> 2:03:30.280]  knows bio-weapons, that they did not have the expertise, someone had to give it to them.
[2:03:30.280 --> 2:03:35.280]  Now, another possibility is the Israelis, because in a speech made by We Fang last summer,
[2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:39.760]  the Defense Minister of China, he talked about the development of race-specific bio-weapons
[2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:41.560]  to wipe out the United States.
[2:03:41.560 --> 2:03:42.560]  That's a quote.
[2:03:42.560 --> 2:03:46.600]  We published it in July of last summer, and it's possible the Israelis had a hand in
[2:03:46.600 --> 2:03:47.600]  it.
[2:03:47.600 --> 2:03:48.720]  I think the Israelis might have worked with them.
[2:03:48.720 --> 2:03:52.000]  I don't see the Israelis plotting against the United States in such a fashion.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:55.040]  It doesn't mean that China couldn't have perverted the use of it.
[2:03:55.040 --> 2:03:59.120]  But I'm telling you, Mike, we're making a prima facie case here at the Common Sense
[2:03:59.120 --> 2:04:02.400]  Show that China was actively complicit in this.
[2:04:02.400 --> 2:04:06.600]  In fact, in this three-part series, we established the fact, one, they're colonizing the world,
[2:04:06.600 --> 2:04:09.600]  and we have tons of documentation in the article I wrote.
[2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:13.920]  That's also consistent with Jeff Nyquist, and what he has said, I believe he was interviewed
[2:04:13.920 --> 2:04:14.920]  here as well.
[2:04:14.920 --> 2:04:19.280]  And we've only got, what, 30 seconds of this segment, so Dave, give us your website one
[2:04:19.280 --> 2:04:21.520]  more time and where people can find your work.
[2:04:21.520 --> 2:04:23.160]  Well, thanks for having me on.
[2:04:23.160 --> 2:04:26.960]  And first of all, congratulations to Alex, that was a great interview with officials
[2:04:26.960 --> 2:04:27.960]  from Brazil.
[2:04:27.960 --> 2:04:28.960]  That was tremendous.
[2:04:28.960 --> 2:04:32.840]  But anyway, the commonsenseshow.com, both website and also the Common Sense Show on
[2:04:32.840 --> 2:04:35.680]  YouTube is where people can find us and keep up with us.
[2:04:35.680 --> 2:04:36.680]  You're still on YouTube?
[2:04:36.680 --> 2:04:37.680]  They haven't banned you yet?
[2:04:37.680 --> 2:04:40.120]  Well, wait till they get this interview.
[2:04:40.120 --> 2:04:41.120]  You're gone, buddy.
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:42.120]  You're gone from YouTube.
[2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:43.120]  But thanks for joining us today.
[2:04:43.120 --> 2:04:45.400]  We'll be right back with another bombshell interview.
[2:04:45.400 --> 2:04:47.400]  Mike Adams here on the Alex Jones Show.
[2:04:47.400 --> 2:05:12.720]  Dave Hodges will be banned forever after today, trust me.
[2:05:12.720 --> 2:05:40.320]  It's been about 25 years.
[2:05:40.320 --> 2:05:45.200]  big articles up on info wars dot com that break this down UK teen find at her
[2:05:45.200 --> 2:05:50.160]  house arrest for asking trans police officers gender UK mother spared jail
[2:05:50.160 --> 2:05:55.640]  for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay 1,000 pound fine
[2:05:55.640 --> 2:06:13.120]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show with Mike Adams
[2:06:13.120 --> 2:06:17.600]  well the bombshells just never end here it seems you're watching the Alex Jones
[2:06:17.600 --> 2:06:24.240]  show and in this segment I'm joined by James Lyons Weiler from the Institute of
[2:06:24.240 --> 2:06:31.920]  Pure and applied knowledge that's I pack knowledge org IPAK knowledge org and
[2:06:31.920 --> 2:06:36.440]  this is the first time I've interviewed this gentleman he came up on my radar
[2:06:36.440 --> 2:06:43.680]  with articles about not only aluminum toxicity but also with the virology the
[2:06:43.680 --> 2:06:48.080]  the protein structure the potential engineering of this coronavirus that is
[2:06:48.080 --> 2:06:51.360]  now threatening the world and I really enjoy interviewing other scientists
[2:06:51.360 --> 2:06:55.500]  because we can get into the technical details and you know translate them and
[2:06:55.500 --> 2:07:01.680]  everything so everybody can understand but this guy Lyons Weiler I don't know
[2:07:01.680 --> 2:07:06.760]  how he wants me to refer to him this guy's really smart he knows his stuff
[2:07:06.760 --> 2:07:10.720]  and so I'm honored to have him on the show here for the first time James
[2:07:10.720 --> 2:07:14.520]  welcome welcome to the show it's great to have you on thank you thank you my
[2:07:14.520 --> 2:07:19.680]  Mike is I think we've had an opportunity to meet in person one time but my my
[2:07:19.680 --> 2:07:25.720]  friends call me Dr. Jack so Dr. Jack okay thanks thanks for having me well
[2:07:25.720 --> 2:07:30.560]  it's great to have you on so you were one of the first if not the very first
[2:07:30.560 --> 2:07:35.800]  voice to talk about the bioengineering origins of this particular strain of
[2:07:35.800 --> 2:07:40.080]  COVID-19 coronavirus can you take us back to that when did you first realize
[2:07:40.080 --> 2:07:45.800]  that that was the case well actually I I stated it as a hypothesis as a good
[2:07:45.800 --> 2:07:52.520]  scientist would that because I had found similarity between a vector technology
[2:07:52.520 --> 2:07:59.960]  element called P Shuttle SN and the missing I'm sorry the the the inserted
[2:07:59.960 --> 2:08:04.940]  I don't want to say it the the part of the sequence that no scientist could
[2:08:04.940 --> 2:08:08.640]  identify it see what what had happened was the Chinese published a genomic
[2:08:08.640 --> 2:08:11.880]  sequence and they've reported there was part of a sequence they couldn't
[2:08:11.880 --> 2:08:16.400]  identify and then Greek team analyzed the data and they couldn't identify that
[2:08:16.400 --> 2:08:22.960]  part of the of the DN of the sorry RNA sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus
[2:08:22.960 --> 2:08:28.960]  and so I simply looked at non-viral sequences and I came up with a match to
[2:08:28.960 --> 2:08:33.760]  P Shuttle SN and I thought hey that that's a reasonable thing to expect that
[2:08:33.760 --> 2:08:37.600]  perhaps they were messing around in the lab because you know they do create
[2:08:37.600 --> 2:08:45.000]  recombinant viruses to study the pathogenicity to study you know to
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:50.320]  create enough protein to create you know antibodies to study antibodies against
[2:08:50.320 --> 2:08:55.720]  it so they do these gain-of-function studies as you know to try to develop
[2:08:55.720 --> 2:09:00.520]  vaccines and so on so I thought perhaps what had happened was that there was a
[2:09:00.520 --> 2:09:07.760]  laboratory accident from a laboratory modified virus using P Shuttle created
[2:09:07.760 --> 2:09:11.960]  using P Shuttle SN and the similarity to P Shuttle SN is in the spike protein
[2:09:11.960 --> 2:09:18.120]  area but it turns out that after extensive further analysis and I have a
[2:09:18.120 --> 2:09:22.600]  paper that's in the peer review right now of this that uses phylogenetics
[2:09:22.600 --> 2:09:28.960]  which is my area of expertise I can pretty much rule out that given all the
[2:09:28.960 --> 2:09:32.800]  recombinant viruses that we know of that involved the SARS and SARS like
[2:09:32.800 --> 2:09:39.520]  coronavirus spike protein that those recombinant viruses are not this most
[2:09:39.520 --> 2:09:45.760]  most closely related proteins as far as a spike protein goes to this novel
[2:09:45.760 --> 2:09:51.000]  coronavirus so just to put this in layman's terms what it what it means
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:55.200]  and you can correct me if I'm wrong but what this means is that this is not a
[2:09:55.200 --> 2:09:59.720]  naturally occurring mutation with a lineage that can be traced through other
[2:09:59.720 --> 2:10:04.920]  in the wild viruses is that correct actually ironically part of the slew
[2:10:04.920 --> 2:10:08.760]  thing that I did was I looked like you guys are looking you're looking at which
[2:10:08.760 --> 2:10:14.920]  labs have recombinant SARS like proteins and so on viruses and so on the
[2:10:14.920 --> 2:10:23.000]  Chinese published a sequence in 2005 and they put it into national database
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:27.960]  the University of Nevada sorry the University of North Carolina downloaded
[2:10:27.960 --> 2:10:33.320]  that sequence and three other sequences this this particular sequence that I'm
[2:10:33.320 --> 2:10:38.600]  talking about was from a bat okay it was from a natural isolate and then the
[2:10:38.600 --> 2:10:45.200]  Chinese had it and the UNC team downloaded it and reconstructed a
[2:10:45.200 --> 2:10:51.120]  virus from those four four viruses thinking they were all SARS and so they
[2:10:51.120 --> 2:10:56.800]  accidentally had this but they didn't know it and so the way that I can know
[2:10:56.800 --> 2:11:02.280]  that is that there's a very very diagnostic if you will characteristic
[2:11:02.280 --> 2:11:08.520]  protein motif pattern what a protein motif is is is part of the sequence of
[2:11:08.520 --> 2:11:14.480]  a protein that has a known or suspected function and so I found a signature
[2:11:14.480 --> 2:11:21.160]  that's unique to the coronavirus from 2019 it I won't get into the details but
[2:11:21.160 --> 2:11:26.520]  it has a short and terminal spike domain very unusual it has a missing she three
[2:11:26.520 --> 2:11:33.920]  and a KXCL motif and a C terminal GP 41 retro viral envelope mode patterns now
[2:11:33.920 --> 2:11:39.320]  this is just in the spike protein and so and none of the other coronaviruses
[2:11:39.320 --> 2:11:45.320]  have that particular motif pattern not P shuttle SN not the sequence from the
[2:11:45.320 --> 2:11:50.480]  cancer center or the genome center from which P shuttle SN was created in China
[2:11:50.480 --> 2:11:56.160]  no other coronaviruses have them except for the two sequences the one that was
[2:11:56.160 --> 2:12:01.640]  downloaded that was published by the Chinese from a natural source in 2005
[2:12:01.640 --> 2:12:07.960]  and the one that was downloaded by UNC so to my knowledge as far as I know
[2:12:07.960 --> 2:12:13.240]  that the that's this sequence actually comes from a natural source we had it in
[2:12:13.240 --> 2:12:17.600]  2005 and 2008 but we didn't know it and so I'm trying to get this published I
[2:12:17.600 --> 2:12:22.000]  hope that the people who are doing the peer review understand that yeah there
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:25.560]  are biological differences with the spike protein and they're important but
[2:12:25.560 --> 2:12:31.200]  those biological differences don't automatically have to involve laboratory
[2:12:31.200 --> 2:12:36.240]  origin and here's why my current best hypothesis is that this is a SAR
[2:12:36.240 --> 2:12:43.000]  related virus that exists in the wild that is a testable hypothesis still
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:47.160]  that we could find it in other coronaviruses isolated from animals
[2:12:47.160 --> 2:12:51.280]  that's the critical test if we go out into the wild and we get the same exact
[2:12:51.280 --> 2:12:54.960]  sequence from an independent lab has to do this the Chinese labs can't do it no
[2:12:54.960 --> 2:13:00.600]  one will believe it and independently isolate it and then sequence it and
[2:13:00.600 --> 2:13:05.560]  then publish that sequence if it has this characteristic of the virus
[2:13:05.560 --> 2:13:09.400]  characteristic protein motif pattern in the spike protein then it came from the
[2:13:09.400 --> 2:13:14.640]  wild now that doesn't mean it wasn't laboratory released and you know when
[2:13:14.640 --> 2:13:21.440]  we as you know Mike when we do recombinant viral research in the lab we
[2:13:21.440 --> 2:13:29.040]  do a massive massive concentration of tissue whether it's animal tissue or in
[2:13:29.040 --> 2:13:33.840]  a petri dish or human tissue in petri dish or animals that are infected with
[2:13:33.840 --> 2:13:38.880]  this we do a massive constant trace of this virus I'm sorry but we got to
[2:13:38.880 --> 2:13:42.120]  translate some of this for the lay person here because your talk is very
[2:13:42.120 --> 2:13:46.160]  very technical but what I hear you saying is that these pieces and parts
[2:13:46.160 --> 2:13:49.920]  can be harvested from the wild and then reassembled re-engineered together to
[2:13:49.920 --> 2:13:55.000]  make a chimera type of virus in the laboratory and then that virus could have
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:59.560]  been accidentally released from this lab so it sounds like you're saying that
[2:13:59.560 --> 2:14:05.680]  the engineers of this can they may have sourced this from the wild it looks like
[2:14:05.680 --> 2:14:10.600]  it right now and it maybe wasn't the P shuttle vector SN as in vector as you
[2:14:10.600 --> 2:14:13.960]  said before but maybe this was sourced from years ago and then re-engineered is
[2:14:13.960 --> 2:14:18.280]  that correct well the re-engineered part I don't have I don't have evidence that
[2:14:18.280 --> 2:14:22.360]  it's been re-engineered so I'm saying that I think that it's a it's it's from
[2:14:22.360 --> 2:14:28.120]  the lab but it was isolated from nature and it was brought forward when we
[2:14:28.120 --> 2:14:33.480]  when we when we grow these viruses in the lab they the concentration of these
[2:14:33.480 --> 2:14:38.840]  viruses to humans are you know a billion fold to one that you'll ever get in
[2:14:38.840 --> 2:14:43.360]  the in nature it's just an incredible concentration so the most likely source is
[2:14:43.360 --> 2:14:48.760]  that somebody in the lab got artificial I'm sorry accidentally infected or
[2:14:48.760 --> 2:14:52.280]  somebody threw something out the trash and the person removing the trash got
[2:14:52.280 --> 2:14:56.840]  who knows right the story of the Wuhan seafood market I don't believe it the
[2:14:56.840 --> 2:15:00.920]  story that the guy was out collecting bats it got scratched in the face that's
[2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:05.360]  possible but I think the most likely occurrence why because there were four
[2:15:05.360 --> 2:15:12.800]  other escapes of SARS from the lab in China in the past right so I don't see
[2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:17.280]  any evidence in the data that I look at that nest that necessitates that they
[2:15:17.280 --> 2:15:21.800]  were engineered but yes I want your listeners to understand that there are
[2:15:21.800 --> 2:15:27.040]  scores of labs that are doing recombinant experiments gain of function experiments
[2:15:27.040 --> 2:15:32.800]  on SARS and on now they're gonna do it on on on this SARS too okay Dr. Jack we
[2:15:32.800 --> 2:15:36.360]  gotta go to break I'm sorry and rough but it very interesting stay with us
[2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:40.400]  continue with us on the other side Dr. Jack is now telling us that it doesn't
[2:15:40.400 --> 2:15:45.560]  look perhaps genetically engineered but rather sort of found and concentrated and
[2:15:45.560 --> 2:15:48.680]  then researched in a lab so we'll get more details from Dr. Jack on the other
[2:15:48.680 --> 2:15:52.960]  side watching the Alex Jones show stay with us
[2:15:53.120 --> 2:15:58.520]  attention GCN self-reliance listeners if you've ever wanted an emergency solar

[2:16:13.400 --> 2:16:17.080]  off the grid the clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're
[2:16:17.080 --> 2:16:20.480]  having here right on the East Bank of the Mississippi because of the flooding
[2:16:20.480 --> 2:16:24.400]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than
[2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:27.640]  move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that
[2:16:27.640 --> 2:16:32.040]  might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory so here's

[2:19:00.640 --> 2:19:05.320]  the work to help people be prepared and instead of just giving into sickness care
[2:19:05.320 --> 2:19:08.800]  they care of their health they care of their nutrition in a way that contributes
[2:19:08.800 --> 2:19:13.000]  to greater vitality and I say that from personal experience because I know that
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:17.200]  the products that are being offered here I've tried them and I use them every
[2:19:17.200 --> 2:19:21.400]  day and that power pack that they have the ampm power pack well I wouldn't be
[2:19:21.400 --> 2:19:26.600]  so energetic this morning except that I have been on a regular customer in that
[2:19:26.600 --> 2:19:29.480]  regard I just want to start out by saying that because I think it's
[2:19:29.480 --> 2:19:33.480]  important to remember that beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to
[2:19:33.480 --> 2:19:36.840]  help equip people to think about these great events in the world one of the
[2:19:36.840 --> 2:19:42.520]  priorities has to be to take care of yourself remembering that our lives are
[2:19:42.520 --> 2:19:47.880]  a gift from God that he intends us to use for good purpose for our families
[2:19:47.880 --> 2:19:52.040]  and for our communities and right now folks who are willing to think like we
[2:19:52.040 --> 2:19:56.160]  do are critical to the future of America
[2:19:56.160 --> 2:20:03.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:14.160 --> 2:20:21.720]  I am a shotgun rider for the San Jacinto line we continue with dr. Jack as as
[2:20:21.720 --> 2:20:26.680]  he's known James Lyons Weiler from the Institute of Pure and Applied Knowledge
[2:20:26.680 --> 2:20:31.560]  I pack knowledge.org is the website one of the first people to raise the
[2:20:31.560 --> 2:20:36.720]  possibility that there was a P Shuttle SN vector kind of a fingerprint of
[2:20:36.720 --> 2:20:41.000]  possible genetic engineering of this virus now saying if I'm if I'm reading
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:45.040]  him correctly now saying that he believes that that P Shuttle vector is not the
[2:20:45.040 --> 2:20:53.520]  best fit that it may be harvested from the wild but then studied and replicated
[2:20:53.520 --> 2:20:59.760]  and concentrated in a lab followed by an accidental laboratory release of it so
[2:20:59.760 --> 2:21:03.840]  is that is that a deep an accurate summary dr. Jack I don't want to miss
[2:21:03.840 --> 2:21:08.840]  state anything you've said but we have to translate this into you know regular
[2:21:08.840 --> 2:21:12.800]  layperson's language so go ahead I I deeply appreciate that Mike and yes
[2:21:12.800 --> 2:21:17.360]  that's exactly what I'm saying the data that I had that originally pointed to
[2:21:17.360 --> 2:21:23.800]  P Shuttle SN was done just by noticing that there was a similarity and just
[2:21:23.800 --> 2:21:28.360]  looking at similarity doesn't tell us the evolutionary relationships and so the
[2:21:28.360 --> 2:21:34.760]  combination of the kind of diagnostic sleuthing that I did was was by looking
[2:21:34.760 --> 2:21:39.800]  at the full evolutionary story of the spike proteins there's no recombinant
[2:21:39.800 --> 2:21:47.560]  protein in any of the databases from any of the labs and that that that cluster
[2:21:47.560 --> 2:21:53.520]  so closely with this it doesn't make we can't say that there's an ancestor of
[2:21:53.520 --> 2:21:57.720]  the of what's currently infecting people you know and it certainly doesn't help
[2:21:57.720 --> 2:22:01.960]  that Nanjing Military Institute published a background of virus or the
[2:22:01.960 --> 2:22:06.680]  pangolin sequence was published in January is all very suspicious you know
[2:22:06.680 --> 2:22:11.440]  and if I was China I would try to put some sequences any sequence between the
[2:22:11.440 --> 2:22:17.440]  Military Institute sequence background of virus and you know SARS-2 I would be
[2:22:17.440 --> 2:22:22.320]  desperate to put anything between there so you know I'm not saying that they did
[2:22:22.320 --> 2:22:27.160]  but there was a moment where I thought hey perhaps there actually the sequences
[2:22:27.160 --> 2:22:31.080]  that are publicly being published in January might be falsified data to try
[2:22:31.080 --> 2:22:35.880]  to mislead people like me who are going to do the analyses and find these
[2:22:35.880 --> 2:22:42.520]  relationships but I honestly think given all the data that I have I can't find
[2:22:42.520 --> 2:22:46.400]  any signature whatsoever that the spike protein is related to any that we know
[2:22:46.400 --> 2:22:50.480]  of now there could be other recombinant viruses that we don't know of that's the
[2:22:50.480 --> 2:22:57.320]  thing about science right but you know I don't think Dr. Xi intentionally put
[2:22:57.320 --> 2:23:01.880]  this particular spike protein or anybody else put this spike protein and I
[2:23:01.880 --> 2:23:08.840]  think we got lucky in 2008 at UNC because had they only downloaded this we
[2:23:08.840 --> 2:23:12.320]  could have had this novel coronavirus in the United States in a lab as a
[2:23:12.320 --> 2:23:17.040]  functioning virus but they had downloaded three other viruses and
[2:23:17.040 --> 2:23:21.200]  calculated what's called the consensus sequence from which they derived a virus
[2:23:21.200 --> 2:23:26.680]  to study okay that this is a really fascinating detective work that we did
[2:23:26.680 --> 2:23:31.120]  well you're the right detective to follow this but let me ask you some
[2:23:31.120 --> 2:23:34.840]  more practical questions that people are on people's minds so number one
[2:23:34.840 --> 2:23:41.680]  yesterday there was a mutation reported in Iran and so my question to you is as
[2:23:41.680 --> 2:23:47.600]  a phylogeneticist what sort of mutations are likely to occur as this adapts to the
[2:23:47.600 --> 2:23:53.400]  human host are we likely to see less infectiousness lower mortality rates or
[2:23:53.400 --> 2:23:59.200]  possible natural mutation gain of function what what is likely to occur so
[2:23:59.200 --> 2:24:03.440]  we already know that's a great question so we already know that the ACE2 protein
[2:24:03.440 --> 2:24:09.280]  that this enters the cell by that that that the binding of the ACE2 is weaker
[2:24:09.280 --> 2:24:14.800]  in SARS2 than in SARS that's an interesting thing but people have to
[2:24:14.800 --> 2:24:20.000]  understand this is an mRNA this is sorry an RNA virus which means that it has the
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:24.800]  highest mutation rate out of all viruses and that when you get infected with
[2:24:24.800 --> 2:24:30.200]  SARS-CoV-2 or with SARS which COVID-19 I just I want to be clear to the audience
[2:24:30.200 --> 2:24:36.200]  SARS-CoV-2 is the same thing as COVID-19 yeah COVID-19 is the disease caused by
[2:24:36.200 --> 2:24:40.360]  SARS-CoV-2 so when I talk about the virus I'll talk about SARS-CoV-2 when
[2:24:40.360 --> 2:24:44.360]  I'm talking about the disease I'll talk about COVID-19 but when with this
[2:24:44.360 --> 2:24:49.460]  particular virus if you're infected with it and then you have it for say three
[2:24:49.460 --> 2:24:54.440]  weeks or so you're and you're if you're shedding the virus and spreading the
[2:24:54.440 --> 2:24:58.480]  virus the virus that you're spreading in three weeks is completely changed it's
[2:24:58.480 --> 2:25:02.360]  undergone millions of replications so there's mutations just in one body and
[2:25:02.360 --> 2:25:07.280]  it's adapting to our own immune system our immune system is trying to fight it
[2:25:07.280 --> 2:25:12.480]  off it's trying to survive and so on and so you know it's a race between the
[2:25:12.480 --> 2:25:17.160]  evolutionary process with our own body and the adaptive cleverness or
[2:25:17.160 --> 2:25:22.400]  creativity of our immune system to see who's going to win and so it mutates in
[2:25:22.400 --> 2:25:25.760]  every person we know this there's no doubt about it the quite the it's a
[2:25:25.760 --> 2:25:30.800]  great question what should happen if if this is not interfered with with a
[2:25:30.800 --> 2:25:35.000]  vaccine and I don't want to see a vaccine based on a spike protein I'll
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:39.280]  mention why in two seconds what should happen is that as it goes through the
[2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:45.080]  human population it should become less lethal over time because the less lethal
[2:25:45.080 --> 2:25:50.920]  forms will tend to survive and by not killing their host but it could become
[2:25:50.920 --> 2:25:54.600]  more easily transmissible and it could revert to just a common cold where very
[2:25:54.600 --> 2:25:57.960]  few people get seriously ill my concern right now is that we have a very
[2:25:57.960 --> 2:26:05.080]  serious high 15% intensive care situation very critically ill critical
[2:26:05.080 --> 2:26:11.360]  illnesses 15% that's the best estimate that we have and if 15% of Americans who
[2:26:11.360 --> 2:26:16.080]  are affected with this as you know the the curve is is hyper exponential on
[2:26:16.080 --> 2:26:24.520]  this if we don't take steps to spread ourselves out socially and isolate from
[2:26:24.520 --> 2:26:28.560]  each other socially now by not shaking hands by not hugging and kissing in
[2:26:28.560 --> 2:26:33.680]  public and if we if we don't take steps by sanitizing all the public places
[2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:37.640]  that we use it should be you know considered impolite not to sanitize
[2:26:37.640 --> 2:26:41.080]  like you go at the gym if you use gym equipment you're supposed to clean it
[2:26:41.080 --> 2:26:45.080]  afterwards everything you touch in public and I mean condiments and I mean
[2:26:45.080 --> 2:26:49.040]  like menus at restaurants everyone should carry around virus side of wipes
[2:26:49.040 --> 2:26:53.520]  and collaboratively try to clean their own environment of viruses but we
[2:26:53.520 --> 2:26:56.560]  structure society I'm sorry to interrupt but we we structure society
[2:26:56.560 --> 2:27:00.240]  especially in the high-density cities with public transportation in closed
[2:27:00.240 --> 2:27:03.160]  vessels we saw what happened with the Diamond Princess cruise ship which
[2:27:03.160 --> 2:27:07.240]  became the incubation factory of Asia you know you talk about railways and
[2:27:07.240 --> 2:27:12.920]  subway cars and buses and even uber vehicles which are shared spaces inside
[2:27:12.920 --> 2:27:18.480]  an uber vehicle how is anyone going to sanitize these between every use it
[2:27:18.480 --> 2:27:23.600]  seems impossible well I mean if everybody bought virus side of wipes or
[2:27:23.600 --> 2:27:27.640]  created their own by just using like a 10% bleach solution and carried them
[2:27:27.640 --> 2:27:32.480]  around in a baggie this is not impossible is the trick is to get the
[2:27:32.480 --> 2:27:36.480]  word out so that everybody understands it's a kind of a it's impolite to use
[2:27:36.480 --> 2:27:40.920]  public spaces if you touch it clean it and it'd be really nice for people to
[2:27:40.920 --> 2:27:46.920]  understand if you if you're sick then you should self quarantine and find out
[2:27:46.920 --> 2:27:50.200]  if you have coronavirus by talking with you know a medical professional that
[2:27:50.200 --> 2:27:54.440]  can help you to the reason for this is not that we're gonna turn this thing
[2:27:54.440 --> 2:27:59.040]  or it's I think it's too late for us to not see a widespread outbreak what we
[2:27:59.040 --> 2:28:01.920]  need to do is we need to reduce the rate of transmission to the point where we
[2:28:01.920 --> 2:28:05.640]  don't have a breakdown of the medical community being overwhelmed by
[2:28:05.640 --> 2:28:09.200]  critically ill cases oh that happens the mortality rates gonna go through the
[2:28:09.200 --> 2:28:12.760]  roof absolute critical point you're exactly right the first wave of
[2:28:12.760 --> 2:28:17.440]  infections in any new nation to has good quality healthcare because there are
[2:28:17.440 --> 2:28:21.080]  available hospital beds and hospital staff have not yet been infected after
[2:28:21.080 --> 2:28:25.280]  that first wave you see a very sharp spike in mortality rates because
[2:28:25.280 --> 2:28:29.480]  basically doctors are infected and they tell people go home and essentially
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:34.000]  fend for yourself which means go home and die so we're please hold it for one
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:37.760]  more segment with you dr. Jack this is fascinating information I want to ask
[2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:43.960]  you about the 1918 Spanish flu which took three waves three passes through the
[2:28:43.960 --> 2:28:48.320]  globe to cause mass death could we see that or is it gonna be the other way
[2:28:48.320 --> 2:28:52.000]  we'll be back here on the Alex Jones show stay with us much more straight
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:57.360]  ahead attention GCN self-reliance listeners if you've ever wanted an

[2:29:19.880 --> 2:29:23.520]  the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[2:29:23.520 --> 2:29:26.640]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the
[2:29:26.640 --> 2:29:30.160]  system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the

[2:31:07.240 --> 2:31:10.920]  Chinese Communist government has covered up just how bad it is and the
[2:31:10.920 --> 2:31:15.560]  lighthouse is now openly challenging them show our Trump's top scientist and
[2:31:15.560 --> 2:31:22.760]  so is senator cotton my friends now is the time to get prepared 2020 is not a
[2:31:22.760 --> 2:31:26.880]  year to play games with the globalist are trying to create economic collapse
[2:31:26.880 --> 2:31:31.560]  race riots we don't know how bad this virus is gonna get here that's why

[2:32:08.600 --> 2:32:11.440]  ago I said what can you handle I said I think it's gonna be really big and they
[2:32:11.440 --> 2:32:13.960]  said we can handle probably this we're not sure we're investing everything we've
[2:32:13.960 --> 2:32:17.080]  got to even pay it forward to be able to fund I said no I think this is gonna be
[2:32:17.080 --> 2:32:19.480]  huge I think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more
[2:32:19.480 --> 2:32:21.920]  food even though the prices are going up for you so those are the type of
[2:32:21.920 --> 2:32:24.920]  discussions we have I'm just giving the inside baseball of all of us this is a
[2:32:24.920 --> 2:32:29.200]  hundred times regular volume plus was a hundred times a few days ago now it's
[2:32:29.200 --> 2:32:34.000]  about 200 times okay infowarstore.com you go right in the queue first come first
[2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:38.360]  start but the fact that the orders are so ultra massive it's dizzying I mean
[2:32:38.360 --> 2:32:41.640]  this is just insane we're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be
[2:32:41.640 --> 2:32:46.240]  safe and then if it continues like this we're looking at having to suspend
[2:32:46.240 --> 2:32:49.840]  food sales but everybody gets to order in we'll get your food but that's how big
[2:32:49.840 --> 2:32:52.560]  this is so what you're getting is a hundred percent the straight deal of
[2:32:52.560 --> 2:32:56.240]  what's going on infowarstore.com
[2:32:56.800 --> 2:33:02.240]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:33:06.120 --> 2:33:13.880]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:33:13.880 --> 2:33:21.440]  he it's Mike Adams all right we're back on the Alex Jones show Mike Adams here
[2:33:21.440 --> 2:33:26.760]  we've got Dr. Jack also James his name is James Lyons Weiler he's a scientist
[2:33:26.760 --> 2:33:30.920]  who follows the evidence that's what I like about him he's very smart he has
[2:33:30.920 --> 2:33:35.440]  theories but he backs them up with research and data and then adjusts his
[2:33:35.440 --> 2:33:39.400]  statements accordingly this is the process of science that seems to be
[2:33:39.400 --> 2:33:43.600]  lacking today before we get to him just a couple of quick updates on products the
[2:33:43.600 --> 2:33:51.040]  info wars store.com food supply is now up to eight weeks out if you want some of
[2:33:51.040 --> 2:33:56.320]  that food if you order today it takes eight weeks for the shipment to happen
[2:33:56.320 --> 2:34:00.000]  this is increased well for some orders not all but for some this is increased
[2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:05.080]  from five weeks to eight weeks in just 24 hours you better get your order in now
[2:34:05.080 --> 2:34:09.760]  if you if you want some of the food and as Dr. Jack is listening I will share my
[2:34:09.760 --> 2:34:14.480]  joke from yesterday I said the are not value of the virus is so high that we're
[2:34:14.480 --> 2:34:18.680]  having an are not sale on food which means if you wait you are not gonna get
[2:34:18.680 --> 2:34:24.640]  any so that's just bad geek science I apologize for that secondly at my own
[2:34:24.640 --> 2:34:28.880]  store Alex gives me the opportunity to plug a product from my own store
[2:34:28.880 --> 2:34:33.440]  healthrangerstore.com we have non-China Hawaiian
[2:34:33.440 --> 2:34:39.360]  Azazanthin and Hawaiian spirulina both of those are in stock which probably won't
[2:34:39.360 --> 2:34:42.680]  last long given what's going on but Azazanthin is the king of the
[2:34:42.680 --> 2:34:47.760]  carotenoids it's a fat soluble carotenoid and of course spirulina is used
[2:34:47.760 --> 2:34:51.160]  for many different things it's a superfood based on a micro algae we've
[2:34:51.160 --> 2:34:56.320]  got the non-China sources which is the Hawaii supply line so while that
[2:34:56.320 --> 2:35:00.320]  supply line last healthrangerstore.com is where you can get that now going back
[2:35:00.320 --> 2:35:05.480]  to Dr. Jack I asked you before the break about you know the Spanish flu and was
[2:35:05.480 --> 2:35:09.320]  that mutating there were three waves according to history that that swept
[2:35:09.320 --> 2:35:13.160]  through the world can you kind of explain in your view what was happening
[2:35:13.160 --> 2:35:19.600]  then and could that happen now yeah the origin of the Spanish flu Kevin Barry
[2:35:19.600 --> 2:35:24.800]  did a fantastic you know detective search on on the origins and it seems
[2:35:24.800 --> 2:35:32.400]  like it may have had a very unusual origin and and and so you know it's
[2:35:32.400 --> 2:35:37.680]  hard to draw a contrast comparison should say between an influenza virus and
[2:35:37.680 --> 2:35:43.400]  the coronavirus because you know they're very different beasts the question
[2:35:43.400 --> 2:35:45.960]  really is whether or not this coronavirus is going to be a second
[2:35:45.960 --> 2:35:50.080]  Spanish flu and I think it's entirely up to whether or not we're willing and
[2:35:50.080 --> 2:35:54.360]  able to change our culture in terms of what we expect without getting angry or
[2:35:54.360 --> 2:35:59.280]  suspicious of other people there is no us versus them in this the infected are
[2:35:59.280 --> 2:36:03.760]  us because of this long asymptomatic period it's five to thirty days and it's
[2:36:03.760 --> 2:36:07.680]  asymptomatic period you could be infected I could be infected who knows so
[2:36:07.680 --> 2:36:11.480]  there is no us versus them what there is is whether or not we're all willing to
[2:36:11.480 --> 2:36:15.680]  pull together to protect ourselves and our family and those around us you know
[2:36:15.680 --> 2:36:21.880]  the simple act of not shaking hands and not kissing could prevent thousands of
[2:36:21.880 --> 2:36:27.480]  infections downstream you know the simple act of self-quarantine you could be a
[2:36:27.480 --> 2:36:31.720]  superhero by pretending right if you're a super spreader and you don't know it
[2:36:31.720 --> 2:36:36.280]  you could be preventing millions of cases of coronavirus by doing the right
[2:36:36.280 --> 2:36:43.720]  thing but by self-quarantining for you know two or three weeks and so we have
[2:36:43.720 --> 2:36:48.720]  now a weapon on our side which is what we're doing right now we're in the
[2:36:48.720 --> 2:36:51.920]  information age we have the ability to independent of the fact that the
[2:36:51.920 --> 2:36:55.160]  government's not telling us the right things to do of getting the word out
[2:36:55.160 --> 2:36:59.920]  that you know making sure that that you designate one person if you have
[2:36:59.920 --> 2:37:04.280]  multiple house houses in your household maybe you want to put all of your
[2:37:04.280 --> 2:37:07.760]  family into the largest house and have one person that goes out to do the
[2:37:07.760 --> 2:37:12.760]  grocery shopping if the government says you have to quarantine go but you can
[2:37:12.760 --> 2:37:15.600]  go out two or three times a week to grocery shop maybe you should just risk
[2:37:15.600 --> 2:37:19.560]  one person who then drops the groceries off it's only for a month with Dr. Jack
[2:37:19.560 --> 2:37:23.040]  in lifestyle what you're saying makes perfect sense but I've been seeing news
[2:37:23.040 --> 2:37:26.720]  reports all over Asia out of China you know I've got a staff in Taiwan they
[2:37:26.720 --> 2:37:32.200]  translate Chinese media for me every every night and there are people who
[2:37:32.200 --> 2:37:36.800]  just blatantly violate all the quarantines they're told self-quarantine you
[2:37:36.800 --> 2:37:40.160]  know it's sort of like the first wave is hey we're not gonna put a gun to your
[2:37:40.160 --> 2:37:45.280]  head yet so go home be a an intelligent person be responsible quarantine
[2:37:45.280 --> 2:37:49.080]  yourself and then those people five hours later are out at a rave club on
[2:37:49.080 --> 2:37:53.080]  social media bragging about hey I don't have any symptoms so then that's when the
[2:37:53.080 --> 2:37:57.000]  gunpoint medicine comes in that's when the quarantines coming but how you know
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:38:02.040]  people cannot be trusted to even be responsible in society not everyone not
[2:38:02.040 --> 2:38:05.400]  everyone can so I've done some simulations Mike and so the good news is
[2:38:05.400 --> 2:38:11.360]  through social isolation if 60% of the population participates and if we get
[2:38:11.360 --> 2:38:15.280]  antivirals whether they're nutraceuticals or pharmaceuticals into
[2:38:15.280 --> 2:38:19.640]  the hands of the people in the towns that have a circulating coronavirus we
[2:38:19.640 --> 2:38:24.160]  can massively massively turn this curve down now it's not going to happen
[2:38:24.160 --> 2:38:27.280]  around the world this is this thing's going to be with us until all the
[2:38:27.280 --> 2:38:33.120]  countries wake up to the fact that you know it's both isolation and treating
[2:38:33.120 --> 2:38:38.320]  yes antivirals you can't do it one way or the other the worst-case scenario is
[2:38:38.320 --> 2:38:42.240]  that we get like 60% I quarantine and this thing will last forever and ever
[2:38:42.240 --> 2:38:45.600]  and ever with quarantine in place forever we can't do that so sooner or
[2:38:45.600 --> 2:38:48.920]  later they'll wake up that the eight billion dollars that the CDC is asking
[2:38:48.920 --> 2:38:54.160]  for maybe got for SARS coronavirus vaccine really ought to be spent to
[2:38:54.160 --> 2:38:58.240]  developing and producing antivirals and getting the antivirals into the hands
[2:38:58.240 --> 2:39:02.040]  all medical all medical professionals should have been told by the
[2:39:02.040 --> 2:39:05.840]  government already start using prophylactic antivirals and you're
[2:39:05.840 --> 2:39:09.520]  putting masks on when you visit your patients put googly eyes on your masks
[2:39:09.520 --> 2:39:13.520]  if you're with kids and make a joke out of it don't scare them but you know we
[2:39:13.520 --> 2:39:17.560]  don't want to spike protein based vaccine and here's why the animal studies
[2:39:17.560 --> 2:39:20.960]  show that when you develop a spike protein based vaccine for coronavirus
[2:39:20.960 --> 2:39:26.440]  like SARS and then you inject the mice with the vaccine the mice are fine but
[2:39:26.440 --> 2:39:29.680]  then when you infect them with the coronavirus again you have super high
[2:39:29.680 --> 2:39:34.680]  mortality that's due to original antigenic sin because our memory B
[2:39:34.680 --> 2:39:39.720]  cells think that we our body thinks that it's under attack by the by the type
[2:39:39.720 --> 2:39:42.920]  that you were vaccinated against and the virus as we just talked about a minute
[2:39:42.920 --> 2:39:47.760]  ago has a propensity to mutate very rapidly so SARS-CoV-2 when it's
[2:39:47.760 --> 2:39:51.080]  mutated when it's circulating two months from now is not going to be the
[2:39:51.080 --> 2:39:54.600]  same thing so if they had a vaccine right now and it came to my house and
[2:39:54.600 --> 2:39:57.800]  said hey I would you want this vaccine I'd say no thank you I'd rather self
[2:39:57.800 --> 2:40:01.200]  quarantine let it burn through by the way do you have any antivirals because
[2:40:01.200 --> 2:40:04.440]  I'd rather have that this is a really critical point I'm so glad you said
[2:40:04.440 --> 2:40:08.000]  this so so many important things so the vaccine when they did vaccine research
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:13.160]  on the original SARS coronavirus it was catastrophic in terms of secondary
[2:40:13.160 --> 2:40:18.600]  infections and also given the fact that we don't this is probably going to be
[2:40:18.600 --> 2:40:24.120]  rushed bypassing typical clinical trial protocols it means that and possibly
[2:40:24.120 --> 2:40:27.720]  the vaccine manufacturers are going to be given legal immunity in order to rush
[2:40:27.720 --> 2:40:30.960]  it then we have some quality control questions the second thing that people
[2:40:30.960 --> 2:40:34.800]  need to understand mathematically that you just pointed to is if the if the
[2:40:34.800 --> 2:40:38.600]  mortality of this infection is very high then this means we have wider
[2:40:38.600 --> 2:40:42.920]  tolerance of possible side effects from antiviral drugs because even if the
[2:40:42.920 --> 2:40:46.760]  drug kills one in a thousand people well the virus kills you know two in a
[2:40:46.760 --> 2:40:50.940]  thousand two in a hundred or ten in a hundred so so even a drug that's not
[2:40:50.940 --> 2:40:55.440]  perfectly safe at that point if it is mostly safe it mathematically can make
[2:40:55.440 --> 2:40:59.400]  sense to use that drug and I agree with you it's a great point and it doesn't
[2:40:59.400 --> 2:41:01.880]  even have to be a hundred percent effective and we don't have to get the
[2:41:01.880 --> 2:41:07.320]  drug to all people we need about 60% efficacy or fit 60% coverage with
[2:41:07.320 --> 2:41:12.840]  really aggressive attempts to do social isolation and so thank you Mike for
[2:41:12.840 --> 2:41:16.960]  acknowledging that what what I want to do is I want to point people to a blog
[2:41:16.960 --> 2:41:20.720]  article that I update every day it's at jameslionswiler.com
[2:41:20.720 --> 2:41:29.640]  j-a-m-e-s-l-y-o-n-s-w-e-i-l-e-r.com and it's 20 things that you should know
[2:41:29.640 --> 2:41:34.080]  that you don't know if you scroll if you scroll up you'll see the article it's
[2:41:34.080 --> 2:41:39.000]  things that you don't yet know about the coronavirus it has a list of antivirals
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:43.720]  that are known to work against SARS and MERS why our government says that there's
[2:41:43.720 --> 2:41:47.120]  no antivirals that are known to work against this you talk to the CDC it's
[2:41:47.120 --> 2:41:50.840]  because they don't want that focus out there they want to go towards a vaccine
[2:41:50.840 --> 2:41:55.560]  so they want to turn a blind eye to the risk and and this is updated and I have
[2:41:55.560 --> 2:41:59.360]  a lot of people to thank if you have antivirals that you know work send them
[2:41:59.360 --> 2:42:02.840]  to me and and and I'll and I'll include them all
[2:42:02.840 --> 2:42:07.200]  nutraceuticals as well the things that you know we know are antiviral but
[2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:11.600]  from science and yet the CDC doesn't tell us the other thing I want to point
[2:42:11.600 --> 2:42:17.080]  out is that if we adopt a new culture of constantly sanitizing public places
[2:42:17.080 --> 2:42:22.120]  that we use we could actually bring about a situation where we put an end to
[2:42:22.120 --> 2:42:26.040]  the massive amount of influenza that we see and we could make the vaccine for
[2:42:26.040 --> 2:42:30.920]  influence a completely redundant so in the process it's ironic right that
[2:42:30.920 --> 2:42:35.440]  there's 20 seconds want to yeah if you don't want to be vaccinated against
[2:42:35.440 --> 2:42:40.320]  coronavirus clean where you go in public use this is science this is not this
[2:42:40.320 --> 2:42:45.000]  is not hype this is not anti-vaccine cologne this is a hundred percent how
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:49.200]  can you shut down of an epidemic like this make sure that you don't all right
[2:42:49.200 --> 2:42:52.440]  infect yourself we gotta go to break a fantastic bombshell interview will we
[2:42:52.440 --> 2:42:59.280]  move back this should really be easier than it is I'm not here giving you a

[2:46:55.440 --> 2:47:09.480]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show leading a frontal assault on the lies of
[2:47:09.480 --> 2:47:20.760]  the New World Order it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams. We have entered the official
[2:47:20.760 --> 2:47:28.080]  denial stage of all this by the WHO it's incredible to this day the WHO still
[2:47:28.080 --> 2:47:33.480]  says there's no evidence of domestic transmission in any country outside of
[2:47:33.480 --> 2:47:38.880]  China. How can they say that when we see it in Italy we see it in South Korea
[2:47:38.880 --> 2:47:42.880]  we're about to see it starting next week confirmed cases from the the new
[2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:47.560]  testing in the United States. I mean we're seeing this in Iran this is this
[2:47:47.560 --> 2:47:51.520]  has gone global it's spreading from country to country day by day it was
[2:47:51.520 --> 2:47:55.960]  like more than 30 countries now and the WHO still telling us as if we're all
[2:47:55.960 --> 2:48:01.040]  just stupid sheeple or something saying that this isn't spreading in any other
[2:48:01.040 --> 2:48:05.880]  country this is not a pandemic by their own definition of a pandemic this is a
[2:48:05.880 --> 2:48:10.720]  super pandemic and yet they're telling us just utterly I mean look they're just
[2:48:10.720 --> 2:48:15.200]  discrediting themselves okay who who believes the WHO anymore when they
[2:48:15.200 --> 2:48:18.960]  break they're basically just parroting communist China now in the last segment
[2:48:18.960 --> 2:48:24.040]  we interviewed Dr. James Lyons Weiler or Dr. Jack as he prefers to be called I
[2:48:24.040 --> 2:48:28.520]  think he said something that's just bombshell I think this is the answer and
[2:48:28.520 --> 2:48:35.040]  he's done modeling on this he says if 60% of a given population in a community
[2:48:35.040 --> 2:48:40.800]  where there is an outbreak if 60% self-isolate and then you combine that
[2:48:40.800 --> 2:48:45.120]  with antiviral substances which could be from pharmaceuticals or could be
[2:48:45.120 --> 2:48:51.360]  from natural herbs superfoods and so on if you combine those two you basically
[2:48:51.360 --> 2:48:55.200]  keep this thing under wraps and you prevent an outbreak from exploding I
[2:48:55.200 --> 2:48:59.720]  think that's absolutely key I mean I gotta write a story about this I gotta
[2:48:59.720 --> 2:49:07.080]  cite his interview his words and and do a story on this myself because what's
[2:49:07.080 --> 2:49:12.040]  happening in America is everybody's waiting for a vaccine and just today
[2:49:12.040 --> 2:49:19.240]  Dr. Fauci from the NIH said that the vaccine could take up to two years so
[2:49:19.240 --> 2:49:23.000]  you see all these these news reports about oh the vaccine is only six weeks
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:26.720]  away even even Trump was kind of touting the vaccine in his speech the
[2:49:26.720 --> 2:49:30.520]  other day his press conference he said oh I think a vaccine is very close it's
[2:49:30.520 --> 2:49:36.040]  not close when Dr. Fauci is saying it's two years away and he he controls some
[2:49:36.040 --> 2:49:40.680]  of the purse springs or at least purse strings influences them at the NIH so if
[2:49:40.680 --> 2:49:43.800]  it's two years away what do we do in the meantime do you just let this thing
[2:49:43.800 --> 2:49:49.640]  spread and you just pray or do you take action using the technology and the
[2:49:49.640 --> 2:49:53.680]  know-how that we have right now and that's what Dr. Jack was referring to we
[2:49:53.680 --> 2:49:59.120]  can have social changes we can isolate we can teach people we can use
[2:49:59.120 --> 2:50:03.480]  antivirals whether they be from foods or herbs or spices or natural medicines
[2:50:03.480 --> 2:50:08.160]  or pharmaceuticals if they work we could combine these we could make them
[2:50:08.160 --> 2:50:14.400]  available and yet the answer in America so far has been oh we're not going to
[2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:19.880]  test we're going to pretend that this is just like the flu we're going to deny
[2:50:19.880 --> 2:50:24.720]  deny deny and say it's not spreading in America even though we're not testing in
[2:50:24.720 --> 2:50:30.840]  America the CDC's test kits don't work it's amazing that America has failed
[2:50:30.840 --> 2:50:37.440]  Trump said we're in first place you know most most resilient to an outbreak well
[2:50:37.440 --> 2:50:42.080]  when it comes to test kits America is in last place absolute last place thank
[2:50:42.080 --> 2:50:46.600]  you CDC for putting us in this position I did the math last hour where two
[2:50:46.600 --> 2:50:51.320]  infections can become a thousand 24 infections in about 25 days because we're
[2:50:51.320 --> 2:50:55.720]  not doing any intelligence no no surveillance you could say of of the
[2:50:55.720 --> 2:51:00.440]  infections which is the CDC's job they're supposed to be testing and they're not
[2:51:00.440 --> 2:51:06.040]  testing well that hopefully that has changed now so as of next week we're
[2:51:06.040 --> 2:51:10.480]  going to start seeing labs testing across America and Trump needs to get on
[2:51:10.480 --> 2:51:14.920]  top of this because we do not want a communist in the White House Bernie
[2:51:14.920 --> 2:51:20.120]  Sanders how would a communist deal with a pandemic they would just outlaw the
[2:51:20.120 --> 2:51:23.680]  virus and then pretend it's not infecting anyone oh it's illegal to be a
[2:51:23.680 --> 2:51:27.800]  virus and if you're a virus you go to the gulag you know what the virus
[2:51:27.800 --> 2:51:31.720]  doesn't care what you think and what your laws are let's go to the map here
[2:51:31.720 --> 2:51:37.880]  South Korea 2,000 now 337 confirmed infections South Korea is one of the
[2:51:37.880 --> 2:51:43.880]  countries that's telling the truth and so how is South Korea even detecting 2,300
[2:51:43.880 --> 2:51:47.280]  infections well it's because South Korea is testing tens of thousands of people
[2:51:47.280 --> 2:51:52.160]  something that the United States has not yet done so the US is way behind South
[2:51:52.160 --> 2:51:55.600]  Korea when it comes to testing it's it's incredible in fact we're gonna go to a
[2:51:55.600 --> 2:52:03.120]  clip here in a minute Italy 655 infections I ran now leaping to 388
[2:52:03.120 --> 2:52:09.480]  infections there's no question in my mind that I ran probably has over 10
[2:52:09.480 --> 2:52:13.080]  thousand infections right now and they're just playing catch up there let's go to
[2:52:13.080 --> 2:52:18.680]  if we could I did a new mini documentary called did the CDC order US
[2:52:18.680 --> 2:52:24.560]  States to halt coronavirus testing let's just play a minute of that or so a
[2:52:24.560 --> 2:52:28.200]  minute or two go to that I want people see this is gonna be on band.video if
[2:52:28.200 --> 2:52:32.040]  it's not there already go ahead
[2:52:36.080 --> 2:52:40.800]  title did the CDC order US States to halt all coronavirus testing welcome to
[2:52:40.800 --> 2:52:45.800]  this pandemic.news special report this is Mike Adams the health ranger here
[2:52:45.800 --> 2:52:50.280]  founder of naturalnews.com and publisher of pandemic.news and when it
[2:52:50.280 --> 2:52:53.840]  comes to the coronavirus there are two groups of people people who have been
[2:52:53.840 --> 2:52:58.920]  tested for the virus and people who have not been tested now of course I know
[2:52:58.920 --> 2:53:03.480]  this is common sense but the official numbers that are reported of how many
[2:53:03.480 --> 2:53:08.200]  confirmed cases of the coronavirus have been detected only comes from
[2:53:08.200 --> 2:53:12.720]  obviously the group of people who have been tested but that number does not
[2:53:12.720 --> 2:53:16.760]  represent all the people who have not been tested and the number of people who
[2:53:16.760 --> 2:53:21.160]  have not been tested for the virus is of course exponentially larger than the
[2:53:21.160 --> 2:53:25.600]  people who have been tested so when you see official numbers whether it's from
[2:53:25.600 --> 2:53:31.200]  China or the United States you should note that those official numbers do not
[2:53:31.200 --> 2:53:35.760]  represent the actual number of people who are infected they only represent
[2:53:35.760 --> 2:53:40.840]  those who have been tested now typically people who get tested are people who
[2:53:40.840 --> 2:53:45.040]  start to show symptoms because before they show symptoms they're not even
[2:53:45.040 --> 2:53:49.240]  aware that they have the virus so there's no reason to test them all right
[2:53:49.240 --> 2:53:53.680]  I'm gonna interrupt this I just encourage you to go to band.video that
[2:53:53.680 --> 2:53:57.200]  full mini documentary it's about nine minutes long ten minutes it'll be up on
[2:53:57.200 --> 2:54:00.960]  band.video if it's not there already I also want to show you another clip this
[2:54:00.960 --> 2:54:06.040]  is a quarantine enforcement training exercise in China that shows you what
[2:54:06.040 --> 2:54:09.920]  China is planning to do to treat their people well they're already doing this
[2:54:09.920 --> 2:54:13.600]  treating people like dogs check this out this video is amazing I'll kind of
[2:54:13.600 --> 2:54:21.880]  narrate it go ahead all right they're at a road block checkpoint telling the cars
[2:54:21.880 --> 2:54:26.520]  to stop for those of you who aren't seeing the video I'll just narrate it for
[2:54:26.520 --> 2:54:31.240]  you but now asking questions of the driver they're taking his temperature
[2:54:31.240 --> 2:54:37.520]  with an infrared thermometer the driver is saying something they don't like here
[2:54:37.520 --> 2:54:42.720]  comes a man with a shield like the the SWAT team actually says SWAT they're
[2:54:42.720 --> 2:54:49.200]  armed they're yelling demanding questions at the driver I can't understand
[2:54:49.200 --> 2:54:52.960]  this Chinese they're talking behind masks so I have no idea what they're saying here
[2:54:52.960 --> 2:55:00.680]  the guys trying to escape oh sirens a van blocking the road and they're throwing
[2:55:00.680 --> 2:55:06.920]  spikes across the road they're demanding that he get out of his car he's
[2:55:06.920 --> 2:55:12.200]  getting out taking off his mask he says everything's cool oh they just got him
[2:55:12.200 --> 2:55:18.280]  over the head with a dog catching net SWAT team he's taking him down they put
[2:55:18.280 --> 2:55:23.840]  a hood over his head they're taking him away screaming more commands behind a
[2:55:23.840 --> 2:55:31.720]  riot shield now they're taking away the road spikes problem solved and they're
[2:55:31.720 --> 2:55:36.320]  spraying some kind of antiviral chemical all over the response team and the
[2:55:36.320 --> 2:55:41.800]  vehicle itself this is an exercise in China and no doubt in reality that person
[2:55:41.800 --> 2:55:47.120]  would be thrown in a quarantine center or I don't know a cremation body bag for
[2:55:47.120 --> 2:55:52.480]  all we know and that's it that's the exercise so they're so China is bragging
[2:55:52.480 --> 2:55:58.160]  about its efficiency in running roadside checkpoints and military style I mean
[2:55:58.160 --> 2:56:04.760]  they've got rifles there military response to quarantines and people on the
[2:56:04.760 --> 2:56:10.000]  road in China now the reason I wanted you to see this is because something very
[2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:15.320]  similar will be coming to America soon in my assessment there will be
[2:56:15.320 --> 2:56:19.920]  quarantines in America they won't be this draconian but they will be similar in
[2:56:19.920 --> 2:56:23.920]  their in their feel and in what they are trying to accomplish this kind of thing
[2:56:23.920 --> 2:56:28.320]  is coming to America I believe very very soon we need to listen to experts like
[2:56:28.320 --> 2:56:34.040]  Dr. Jack we need to push antivirals into the hands of the public we need to
[2:56:34.040 --> 2:56:38.080]  teach people about isolation and self quarantine we need to tell the truth
[2:56:38.080 --> 2:56:41.680]  about this virus and right now all we're getting from the mainstream media is
[2:56:41.680 --> 2:56:48.760]  lies and from the WHO lies and from the CDC cover-up no testing kits and even
[2:56:48.760 --> 2:56:52.960]  from the president right now not yet getting a handle on this and his
[2:56:52.960 --> 2:56:57.040]  presidency is threatened by this and we absolutely cannot lose this country to
[2:56:57.040 --> 2:57:01.680]  leftists or socialists or communists for Trump to stay in power we need him for
[2:57:01.680 --> 2:57:04.960]  another four years to really aggressively drain the swamp and lock up
[2:57:04.960 --> 2:57:08.440]  those criminals we need Trump to get on top of this situation right now and so
[2:57:08.440 --> 2:57:13.280]  my my urgent message for today to wrap this up as the host of the Alex Jones
[2:57:13.280 --> 2:57:17.880]  show President Trump get please get up to speed please get a handle on this
[2:57:17.880 --> 2:57:22.480]  please help us stop this spread across America so that we don't have a
[2:57:22.480 --> 2:57:28.280]  situation here like we just saw in China it's an urgent time running out of
[2:57:28.280 --> 2:57:33.160]  options and next week we'll start to see more cases in America mark my words
[2:57:33.160 --> 2:57:37.520]  I'll bring you more updates next week Alex Jones is back right here later
[2:57:37.520 --> 2:57:44.720]  tonight and over the weekend thanks for tuning in if you understand why the
[2:57:44.720 --> 2:57:49.600]  globalist why the servants of Satan hate info wars it's because we're awake
[2:57:49.600 --> 2:57:56.320]  we're alive we're passionate and we're not giving up that's why it's critical
[2:57:56.320 --> 2:58:00.960]  for those of us that are aware of the new world order's plans to not get down
[2:58:00.960 --> 2:58:05.480]  when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us that's what we
[2:58:05.480 --> 2:58:10.120]  should expect because we are hurting these scumbags the globalists have
[2:58:10.120 --> 2:58:13.920]  literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because
[2:58:13.920 --> 2:58:18.240]  they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and
[2:58:18.240 --> 2:58:23.440]  dominate and destroy the innocent it is up to us who are awake not the sheep
[2:58:23.440 --> 2:58:29.880]  and not the wolves but the sheep dogs to stand firm and resist these wicked
[2:58:29.880 --> 2:58:35.000]  tyrants they fear the fact that we are awake they fear the fact that we are
[2:58:35.000 --> 2:58:40.920]  alive they fear the fact that we love God and that's all we ever have to know
[2:58:40.920 --> 2:58:44.680]  is that God is in charge
[2:58:46.880 --> 2:58:51.840]  Owl killer in New Jersey you're on the air go ahead Alex hey I just want to say
[2:58:51.840 --> 2:58:54.840]  he's great to be back once again and I've never gotten to do this but I'm

[2:59:16.920 --> 2:59:20.440]  better than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my
[2:59:20.440 --> 2:59:23.680]  life so I just want to get that out of the way support this man everything that
[2:59:23.680 --> 2:59:27.360]  he exposed nobody knew about Bohemian Grove nobody knew about FC nobody knew

[2:59:37.760 --> 2:59:40.040]  sir
[2:59:40.040 --> 2:59:52.480]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:59:57.400 --> 3:00:06.280]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones and now your
[3:00:06.280 --> 3:00:15.840]  host Nick baggage and welcome back it's good to be with you on this Friday
[3:00:15.840 --> 3:00:20.320]  afternoon in most of the country still morning in my part of the world coming
[3:00:20.320 --> 3:00:26.840]  from Anchorage Alaska today you know just thinking about all the news I know
[3:00:26.840 --> 3:00:32.520]  the last hour was pretty much on the SARS assuming the virus issue that
[3:00:32.520 --> 3:00:38.320]  Chinese virus issue nobody wants to talk about some of the ramifications of
[3:00:38.320 --> 3:00:41.840]  that and some of the things that are being sort of missed in the news and I
[3:00:41.840 --> 3:00:47.240]  want to mention a couple of things Israeli elections coming up highly
[3:00:47.240 --> 3:00:52.680]  controversial leader that country is in a lot of trouble I guess over
[3:00:52.680 --> 3:00:58.040]  corruption charges and at the same time you got things heating up with the
[3:00:58.040 --> 3:01:05.400]  Palestinians at a time when could turn the tail on an election so pay
[3:01:05.400 --> 3:01:10.400]  attention that that's coming up this week too and not being focused on very
[3:01:10.400 --> 3:01:16.160]  much also the whole Middle Eastern thing is kind of being ignored with virus
[3:01:16.160 --> 3:01:21.560]  news taking the forefront but pay attention second time in a week
[3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:27.640]  Russians have hit Turkish troops and killed a bunch of them that's a that's a
[3:01:27.640 --> 3:01:32.960]  big deal you know a month ago we were talking about we're war three right I
[3:01:32.960 --> 3:01:39.800]  rack and I ran and all the things going on throughout Syria and Libya in fact
[3:01:39.800 --> 3:01:45.480]  and nothing hardly at all in the news this week other news dominating but
[3:01:45.480 --> 3:01:51.640]  this coming week watch for those potential shockwaves headed our way
[3:01:51.640 --> 3:01:58.120]  talking about the virus just a little bit you know I mentioned in the last
[3:01:58.120 --> 3:02:05.320]  week show that my fiancee and I were back from Thailand on the 9th of February
[3:02:05.320 --> 3:02:12.120]  and our observations going into Thailand via Hong Kong and then coming out of
[3:02:12.120 --> 3:02:18.400]  Thailand via Hong Kong and then direct into Seattle from Hong Kong arriving on
[3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:24.840]  February 9th in Seattle and there were no questions no checks no temperature
[3:02:24.840 --> 3:02:34.840]  checks nothing on the US side but two weeks before on the 25th of January all
[3:02:34.840 --> 3:02:41.880]  the way into the 27th transiting Hong Kong and going into Phuket Thailand our
[3:02:41.880 --> 3:02:47.120]  temperatures were checked by infrared cameras first and then people that had
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:52.640]  elevated temperatures pulled a line and checked more carefully on the way out on
[3:02:52.640 --> 3:02:58.840]  the 9th we were checked individually at three different points in Thailand and
[3:02:58.840 --> 3:03:04.040]  Hong Kong but not checked questioned at all when entering the US so I think
[3:03:04.040 --> 3:03:10.280]  that's something worthy of note that the third world responded quicker than the
[3:03:10.280 --> 3:03:17.000]  US so why is that who knows the big ramifications coming up that people
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:22.120]  aren't considering and were alluded to in the last hour were the roll-up on
[3:03:22.120 --> 3:03:27.720]  supply chain and this is where the big damages headed our way because so much of
[3:03:27.720 --> 3:03:33.240]  the US industry is related to China production and China's had a triple
[3:03:33.240 --> 3:03:37.960]  whammy as the second largest economy in the world affecting everyone's supply
[3:03:37.960 --> 3:03:45.520]  chains worldwide first you had the the debt problem in China which is out of
[3:03:45.520 --> 3:03:50.200]  control where secondary and tertiary lenders people barring from banks
[3:03:50.200 --> 3:03:55.000]  loaning to others loaning to others creating huge bubbles and borrowing in
[3:03:55.000 --> 3:04:00.040]  China and then that immediately followed by sanctions to rebalance the trade
[3:04:00.040 --> 3:04:06.560]  situation and then that compounded now dramatically compounded by this virus
[3:04:06.560 --> 3:04:13.480]  now on top of that there was a swine flu there was a poultry related flu that
[3:04:13.480 --> 3:04:19.520]  wiped out meat stocks in China at the same time so food shortages and in the
[3:04:19.520 --> 3:04:24.200]  planning month last month this month that's where problems are going to start
[3:04:24.200 --> 3:04:30.520]  showing up in supply chains both direct directly related to food pricing in
[3:04:30.520 --> 3:04:35.600]  China which is now escalating at unprecedented levels and then you look
[3:04:35.600 --> 3:04:43.640]  at the Middle East major droughts on top of that plague and top of that locusts and
[3:04:43.640 --> 3:04:49.560]  so coming back after this hour I want to get into the end times what we're seeing
[3:04:49.560 --> 3:04:55.640]  in the 21st century it's really smart to get high-quality storeable food and
[3:04:55.640 --> 3:05:01.000]  for store.com it's also smart to drink filtered water with Alexa pure system is

[3:05:53.600 --> 3:06:09.200]  live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Nick Baggage you're
[3:06:09.200 --> 3:06:13.680]  listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:06:14.680 --> 3:06:21.600]  and welcome back sorry about that video we lost it on the last segment you know
[3:06:21.600 --> 3:06:26.040]  again looking at sort of the overall picture supply chain interruptions food
[3:06:26.040 --> 3:06:32.840]  production eruptions sort of the really end times isn't it I mean think about it
[3:06:32.840 --> 3:06:36.840]  what's happening in the Middle East largely being ignored right now but we
[3:06:36.840 --> 3:06:41.440]  need to go back pay attention take a look at what's actually happening there
[3:06:41.440 --> 3:06:47.800]  elections next week in Israel you've got big controversies in their leadership
[3:06:47.800 --> 3:06:53.240]  right now things breaking down with Palestinians you got Libya and the
[3:06:53.240 --> 3:06:57.480]  Turks stepping into that conflict you've got Turks being hit by Russians in
[3:06:57.480 --> 3:07:03.320]  Syria twice this week and you have the stock market crashing like crazy the
[3:07:03.320 --> 3:07:10.240]  biggest crash in history in fact I'm thinking about this you know back the
[3:07:10.240 --> 3:07:13.240]  beginning of the year I want to talk a little bit about what sort of built
[3:07:13.240 --> 3:07:19.240]  going into this because this is again a deflection coming into the new year the
[3:07:19.240 --> 3:07:27.400]  amount of money being pumped into the markets by the Fed was unprecedented you
[3:07:27.400 --> 3:07:32.080]  know they didn't call it quantitative easing number four but it really was we
[3:07:32.080 --> 3:07:36.600]  pumped huge amounts and what are called repurchase agreements overnight funds
[3:07:36.600 --> 3:07:41.480]  and this is kind of what happens is as banks loan out money and have credit
[3:07:41.480 --> 3:07:45.880]  cards and debt escalating around the country what you have is at night to
[3:07:45.880 --> 3:07:50.760]  rebalance the books to get loan ratios to balance out banks would loan each other
[3:07:50.760 --> 3:07:54.760]  money those with you know flush reserves could loan the banks with less
[3:07:54.760 --> 3:08:00.040]  reserves and so they had this overnight lending that generated also a fair amount
[3:08:00.040 --> 3:08:06.000]  of revenue streams in passive revenue streams for bankers what happened when
[3:08:06.000 --> 3:08:11.560]  interest rates dropped and and interbank lending became less attractive the
[3:08:11.560 --> 3:08:17.160]  Federal Reserve had to step in and so at the year-end at unprecedented levels the
[3:08:17.160 --> 3:08:21.760]  Federal Reserve stepped in to prop up the markets so you saw these markets
[3:08:21.760 --> 3:08:26.360]  escalating when all of the earnings reports all of the things that would
[3:08:26.360 --> 3:08:31.040]  normally tell us the markets are unstable we're being ignored and
[3:08:31.040 --> 3:08:36.160]  everything running sort of counter to what you would expect under the under
[3:08:36.160 --> 3:08:41.280]  the circumstances so the repo operations are pumping in billions and
[3:08:41.280 --> 3:08:46.480]  billions the image shows 82 billion for those that can see the screen but that
[3:08:46.480 --> 3:08:51.880]  was just a few days they did almost a half a trillion in December November
[3:08:51.880 --> 3:08:58.040]  December I'm going in January and you know there's only so much they can do
[3:08:58.040 --> 3:09:03.640]  and what's happened is they've propped up this market escalated it and if you
[3:09:03.640 --> 3:09:08.680]  look at the charts and compare the escalation of the market and the quick
[3:09:08.680 --> 3:09:15.360]  fall off to 1929 it's a really clean parallel now granted we've had the
[3:09:15.360 --> 3:09:23.120]  fastest decline in US history in the last week continuing even today the
[3:09:23.120 --> 3:09:28.960]  question is will central bankers intervene and can they I don't think so I
[3:09:28.960 --> 3:09:33.920]  think systemically it's on the slippery slope and my son and I were talking
[3:09:33.920 --> 3:09:39.080]  about a month ago month and a half ago before the SARS excuse me that go to
[3:09:39.080 --> 3:09:44.040]  batters came into being and we were talking about black swan effect that
[3:09:44.040 --> 3:09:51.600]  anything could really trigger a huge slide in the market whether it be the
[3:09:51.600 --> 3:09:58.320]  Middle East or we even talked about a pandemic and and these kinds of factors
[3:09:58.320 --> 3:10:03.560]  and that's exactly what we have now and now any other third factor and I think
[3:10:03.560 --> 3:10:06.840]  we'll see you'll see a second factor pick in and then a tertiary a third
[3:10:06.840 --> 3:10:12.920]  factor the second fact right when I have anything to do with this virus it'll
[3:10:12.920 --> 3:10:17.720]  have to do with other things going on as people are ignoring the main other
[3:10:17.720 --> 3:10:23.480]  news feeds that are really relevant in the world right now we got World War
[3:10:23.480 --> 3:10:28.160]  3 about to break I was saying just for the break you got locusts in North
[3:10:28.160 --> 3:10:32.120]  Africa going in the Middle East and they're trying to secure the Chinese
[3:10:32.120 --> 3:10:36.680]  border right I mean in terms of what might might come into that part of the
[3:10:36.680 --> 3:10:42.680]  world but think about food security food production again as a major issue
[3:10:42.680 --> 3:10:49.960]  affecting major parts of North Africa and the world East Africa this is going
[3:10:49.960 --> 3:10:54.160]  to have a huge impact on areas that are already depressed already have gone
[3:10:54.160 --> 3:10:59.520]  through a lot and again it's just one of those things happening on the planet
[3:10:59.520 --> 3:11:05.640]  largely being ignored in the mainstream media today you know you don't hear
[3:11:05.640 --> 3:11:09.000]  anything about Trump anymore I guess because it can't be blamed for locusts
[3:11:09.000 --> 3:11:15.400]  or the plague at the moment but you know that's kind of interesting is how
[3:11:15.400 --> 3:11:20.320]  quickly we go from newsfeed to newsfeed and then the relevance of these gets
[3:11:20.320 --> 3:11:25.320]  lost and actually their importance is kind of scuttled aside and you wonder
[3:11:25.320 --> 3:11:30.280]  was it important I mean is it really important are these the issues of the
[3:11:30.280 --> 3:11:37.080]  day and what I would say in all of this is remain calm you know I mean take
[3:11:37.080 --> 3:11:41.480]  precautions do the things that you do to prepare whether you live in the north
[3:11:41.480 --> 3:11:48.240]  and remote locations like you do here in Alaska you kind of prepare right because
[3:11:48.240 --> 3:11:52.320]  you're not on the grid if you follow what's going on in Hawaii because they're
[3:11:52.320 --> 3:11:56.360]  also in an isolated scenario like Alaska you're kind of removed from the rest
[3:11:56.360 --> 3:12:02.200]  country people are stocking up on certain things because it makes sense to do
[3:12:02.200 --> 3:12:08.640]  that not in a crazy way but in a sensible way because we can't trust the
[3:12:08.640 --> 3:12:13.120]  mainstream media to report accurately the news unfortunately and these are the
[3:12:13.120 --> 3:12:18.480]  times when we need it I remember in kindergarten doing the play with my
[3:12:18.480 --> 3:12:23.480]  kindergarten class called never cry wolf you remember that play it's where the
[3:12:23.480 --> 3:12:28.320]  kid would thought it was funny and he would try wolf wolf and his parents in
[3:12:28.320 --> 3:12:32.720]  the village would come running and then nothing would be there the kid thought it
[3:12:32.720 --> 3:12:36.360]  was so funny and he kept doing it then eventually the village quit coming and
[3:12:36.360 --> 3:12:43.160]  then one day a real wolf showed up and the kid was devoured you know so the
[3:12:43.160 --> 3:12:47.480]  mainstream media has cried wolf on so many things we don't know when to trust
[3:12:47.480 --> 3:12:52.320]  them anymore and that's the sad state of affairs so we generally don't trust them
[3:12:52.320 --> 3:13:00.440]  the alternative media's this program this show Alex Jones's entire network has
[3:13:00.440 --> 3:13:05.960]  been historically for now 25 years providing the leading edge news and
[3:13:05.960 --> 3:13:11.600]  that's why we need to support the network now in the two-minute midnight
[3:13:11.600 --> 3:13:16.840]  scenario because it's not over until the last breath is taken and there's a lot
[3:13:16.840 --> 3:13:23.000]  left to do so let's think about this from this perspective we've got elections
[3:13:23.000 --> 3:13:27.680]  that are going to come up in the fall they got a economy that's crashing we've
[3:13:27.680 --> 3:13:33.720]  got people's savings being wiped out and no end in sight to the slippery slope
[3:13:33.720 --> 3:13:39.120]  and what will be blamed is the virus what will be forgotten is all the
[3:13:39.120 --> 3:13:45.040]  underlying rock that existed in the system that now gets the elites and the
[3:13:45.040 --> 3:13:49.200]  bankers off the hook and gives them something to blame Trump for the
[3:13:49.200 --> 3:13:55.520]  economic downtrend but you can't have it both ways either it's the virus or it's
[3:13:55.520 --> 3:14:02.680]  not but let's let's see you know in this weekend I would expect if this thing is
[3:14:02.680 --> 3:14:08.440]  really gonna go badly in the US you're gonna start to see the reports in
[3:14:08.440 --> 3:14:13.800]  various places across country that'll show up over the weekend if it's if it's
[3:14:13.800 --> 3:14:17.760]  really gonna index up because there's been too much traffic now what I also
[3:14:17.760 --> 3:14:24.920]  noticed when I was traveling in Thailand in early February was the lack of
[3:14:24.920 --> 3:14:33.320]  Chinese and my business partner there noted that normally it's like full of
[3:14:33.320 --> 3:14:38.120]  Chinese because it was Chinese New Year in Phuket on the 30th of January and it
[3:14:38.120 --> 3:14:43.400]  was pretty much empty 10% of the normal people showed up according to those
[3:14:43.400 --> 3:14:49.800]  that attend those events regularly and that's a big change so Chinese weren't
[3:14:49.800 --> 3:14:53.680]  traveling by then they were already shutting that down you remember just
[3:14:53.680 --> 3:14:59.640]  before this broke China Hong Kong was rioting about to totally shift gears
[3:14:59.640 --> 3:15:04.600]  this is what the Chinese government is the most worried about today it's not
[3:15:04.600 --> 3:15:10.920]  about proper reporting on the extent of the virus but panic and revolution
[3:15:10.920 --> 3:15:14.800]  because Chinese understand revolution that's what they came into being in the
[3:15:14.800 --> 3:15:19.400]  first place and when people are starving and people are isolated and
[3:15:19.400 --> 3:15:25.080]  people feel forgotten this is the beginning of revolutionary thinking so
[3:15:25.080 --> 3:15:31.320]  perhaps China's in for more than a war on a virus they're doing everything they
[3:15:31.320 --> 3:15:36.600]  can to herd the crowd but you see on the news feeds how they're treating people
[3:15:36.600 --> 3:15:40.840]  there this is gonna happen in the West because it'll be for your safety and
[3:15:40.840 --> 3:15:46.040]  for your security that civil liberties disappear in the middle of this panic so

[3:18:55.480 --> 3:18:59.000]  and I love Trump all day long but man I tell you he sits there and lets these
[3:18:59.000 --> 3:19:02.760]  big tech people keep running rough shot over and everybody I mean I've got a
[3:19:02.760 --> 3:19:07.000]  problem and we'll just take the Trump rallies over that said about two months
[3:19:07.000 --> 3:19:10.920]  ago I came with a plan that I haven't launched yet we have a warehouse full of
[3:19:10.920 --> 3:19:14.920]  hundreds of thousands of stickers 20 different stickers impeach the

[3:19:22.120 --> 3:19:25.840]  your mouth you go to a Trump rally and you instantly take over without even
[3:19:25.840 --> 3:19:28.800]  disrupting things people say why are you doing this what's happening when you
[3:19:28.800 --> 3:19:32.320]  go well we're being censored you know Trump won't do anything about it and
[3:19:32.320 --> 3:19:35.040]  Dr. Pachennick I'm let me just ask you what you think because I've not launched
[3:19:35.040 --> 3:19:40.400]  this yet it's brilliant you've taken the very element that they try to repress
[3:19:40.400 --> 3:19:45.240]  you with that silence and made it into a weapon you have the loudest sound of all
[3:19:45.240 --> 3:19:55.600]  silence and you know what's most disturbing to people silence silence you're
[3:19:55.600 --> 3:19:59.960]  listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:19:59.960 --> 3:20:24.640]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show with Nick baggage and welcome back it's
[3:20:24.640 --> 3:20:29.920]  always good to be here on a Friday afternoon and having not time to talk
[3:20:29.920 --> 3:20:33.320]  about some of the things in the news you know from a little bit different angles
[3:20:33.320 --> 3:20:39.720]  you know and thinking again about bit of the panic party going on because it is
[3:20:39.720 --> 3:20:44.720]  I mean there's a lot going on in the world if we're paying attention same
[3:20:44.720 --> 3:20:51.520]  time you know it's it's time to be calm to think about what we're seeing and
[3:20:51.520 --> 3:20:57.080]  to act accordingly and act deliberately you know when we look at sort of the
[3:20:57.080 --> 3:21:02.680]  acceleration of what's happened we've never seen it drop quite so rapidly as
[3:21:02.680 --> 3:21:08.400]  what we saw in this week and even last Friday going into the week as as things
[3:21:08.400 --> 3:21:15.160]  started to slide and what I would say is we still have a lot to go the weekends
[3:21:15.160 --> 3:21:19.840]  can tell us a lot I think we're gonna see this thing continue to accelerate the
[3:21:19.840 --> 3:21:25.920]  impact economically is yet to yet to be seen and I think that's gonna roll up
[3:21:25.920 --> 3:21:30.760]  in the next quarter and as this one closes out and you begin to really get
[3:21:30.760 --> 3:21:34.600]  the full impact of supply chain interruption the the other thing that
[3:21:34.600 --> 3:21:37.760]  people talked about as well they're gonna move out of China you know given
[3:21:37.760 --> 3:21:43.160]  what happened in the lead up to this which was sanctions people realize your
[3:21:43.160 --> 3:21:47.640]  fight chains were vulnerable maybe they should diversify them a little bit this
[3:21:47.640 --> 3:21:51.720]  is pushing that question over the edge the thing is you can't do it that quick
[3:21:51.720 --> 3:21:55.720]  you can't just say okay tomorrow we're gonna go produce something in Vietnam or
[3:21:55.720 --> 3:22:00.480]  Thailand or Mexico back to the US it doesn't happen that quick it takes time
[3:22:00.480 --> 3:22:10.120]  and resources and right now that's not in the mix that anyone can see so the
[3:22:10.120 --> 3:22:16.120]  real solution is is you know question is and now my my son raises is well we'll
[3:22:16.120 --> 3:22:21.320]  try to get back to work you know because they don't this is a real problem in
[3:22:21.320 --> 3:22:26.960]  another month this continues another month because you're again food
[3:22:26.960 --> 3:22:32.600]  security and basic security globally when you look at what's going on it's
[3:22:32.600 --> 3:22:36.400]  pretty pretty shocking the other thing that that happened that's kind of
[3:22:36.400 --> 3:22:40.880]  counterintuitive in the middle of all this is when one would expect gold and
[3:22:40.880 --> 3:22:45.920]  silver prices to rise today they did the opposite they dropped dramatically now
[3:22:45.920 --> 3:22:53.720]  what what is that signaling what is that telling you earlier in the week several
[3:22:53.720 --> 3:23:00.120]  billions and billions of dollars in gold was trading hands what does that tell
[3:23:00.120 --> 3:23:07.640]  us right now it tells me that hedge funds or large funds that were balancing
[3:23:07.640 --> 3:23:13.080]  their bets market against metals and so on had to start liquidating positions
[3:23:13.080 --> 3:23:17.120]  because they bet wrong and so things that would normally go up are going down
[3:23:17.120 --> 3:23:24.640]  and if anyone's followed gold exchange traded funds ETFs they know that they're
[3:23:24.640 --> 3:23:32.040]  backed by air mostly and not precious metal and so if the air comes out of
[3:23:32.040 --> 3:23:36.240]  that balloon in the course of all of this that could trigger all kinds of
[3:23:36.240 --> 3:23:42.960]  things but if that ever gets fully recognized as the air cushion of the
[3:23:42.960 --> 3:23:48.640]  gold market gold will go crazy on the upside but it's counterintuitive right
[3:23:48.640 --> 3:23:51.600]  now it's moving down when they're ought to be moving up if things are unstable
[3:23:51.600 --> 3:23:55.480]  gold tends to be the reserve currency of everyone in the world and it's
[3:23:55.480 --> 3:24:00.320]  dropping and I think that's exchange traded funds have got to be impacting
[3:24:00.320 --> 3:24:05.000]  that right now the the other thing I would say relative to the supply chain is
[3:24:05.000 --> 3:24:09.440]  you got companies like Coca-Cola that relies on China for supply chain
[3:24:09.440 --> 3:24:14.640]  issuing warnings and even Apple which gets a lot of their bits and pieces from
[3:24:14.640 --> 3:24:20.800]  China are acknowledging problems this is where it is if you follow currencies
[3:24:20.800 --> 3:24:24.720]  currencies tied to China have been dropping and in the last two weeks
[3:24:24.720 --> 3:24:29.840]  dramatically take a look at the Brazilian Real against the dollar and
[3:24:29.840 --> 3:24:35.240]  you'll see it slid 10% in about a month and a half since this thing started and
[3:24:35.240 --> 3:24:39.520]  it was already in trouble so think about Japan's economy which is already in
[3:24:39.520 --> 3:24:45.760]  trouble you think about places that were already in trouble Iran was already in
[3:24:45.760 --> 3:24:52.480]  deep trouble now you have more complications heat on top of that this
[3:24:52.480 --> 3:25:01.080]  is where things start to break down a bit supply chain wise will affect us at
[3:25:01.080 --> 3:25:05.760]  some point how much is built in you know we have what's called just in time
[3:25:05.760 --> 3:25:10.240]  inventories which started you know 20 30 years ago it's kind of the way to
[3:25:10.240 --> 3:25:16.000]  handle it Walmart was famous for it but the idea of just ordering so that in the
[3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:21.080]  supply chain you have built in how long it takes to produce something how long
[3:25:21.080 --> 3:25:25.280]  it's a ship something some marginal warehousing so you don't have too much
[3:25:25.280 --> 3:25:29.360]  time tied up sitting in a warehouse and then on the shelf and on to the consumer
[3:25:29.360 --> 3:25:33.760]  so shortening the timeline and reducing inventories has been what that has
[3:25:33.760 --> 3:25:38.440]  been all about as consequence back stock of inventories sitting in the right
[3:25:38.440 --> 3:25:43.560]  place at the right time are necessarily there the other indicator early
[3:25:43.560 --> 3:25:49.000]  indicator that was alluded to in the last segment is freight volumes you know
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:53.440]  when you start looking at the freight volumes internationally and the indexes
[3:25:53.440 --> 3:25:59.640]  attract this you were at historic lows several times in the last six or eight
[3:25:59.640 --> 3:26:04.840]  weeks historic lows in other words freight is not moving so freight's not
[3:26:04.840 --> 3:26:10.480]  moving warehouses are quickly being depleted factories are not operating in
[3:26:10.480 --> 3:26:15.680]  China right now and other places are shutting down factories I think about
[3:26:15.680 --> 3:26:22.000]  South Korea as a another major economic engine Italy is a major economic engine
[3:26:22.000 --> 3:26:29.000]  the EU because of political correctness on steroids there they won't close
[3:26:29.000 --> 3:26:33.680]  borders within the EU so what's happening in Italy has already moved it's
[3:26:33.680 --> 3:26:38.320]  already in the rest of the EU it's too late turn that off and so you're gonna
[3:26:38.320 --> 3:26:44.840]  see again this weekend will tell the tale on where you see the clusters of this
[3:26:44.840 --> 3:26:52.760]  popping up and so you know I would say that the other thing I would say is watch
[3:26:52.760 --> 3:26:57.520]  South Korea for more accurate reporting because I think they're probably the most
[3:26:57.520 --> 3:27:01.400]  accurate right now I don't know about Italy I don't know about any of the
[3:27:01.400 --> 3:27:08.240]  European reporting but Korea's South Korea least is where you can at least get
[3:27:08.240 --> 3:27:13.600]  some visibility given what's happening there and people there react I mean if
[3:27:13.600 --> 3:27:16.920]  they handle it incorrect the people there are going to be in the streets really
[3:27:16.920 --> 3:27:22.320]  rapidly you know and I don't think we're far from that in China that can create
[3:27:22.320 --> 3:27:28.080]  even bigger problems for the Chinese government but we'll see and here's
[3:27:28.080 --> 3:27:31.640]  something else to reflect on within the United States and I'd given this
[3:27:31.640 --> 3:27:38.000]  statistics a few weeks back before all this started but the average savings in
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:44.320]  the United States for 58% of population is less than a thousand dollars of cash
[3:27:44.320 --> 3:27:52.160]  available this is important because when you start thinking about how long could
[3:27:52.160 --> 3:27:55.480]  you be in the position of Chinese workers right now that are allowed to go to
[3:27:55.480 --> 3:28:01.200]  work for the last month you know these are big issues that potentially will hit
[3:28:01.200 --> 3:28:06.120]  us in the coming weeks and that will be challenging for what we decide to do and
[3:28:06.120 --> 3:28:12.400]  I would say calmly think about what you can do and the last hour they were
[3:28:12.400 --> 3:28:16.600]  talking about just sanitizing your own environments and having some of the
[3:28:16.600 --> 3:28:22.040]  basic ingredients you know around to do that and be a little hyper visual and
[3:28:22.040 --> 3:28:25.160]  about it right now I think that's a reasonable thing for all of us to do
[3:28:25.160 --> 3:28:30.800]  we're doing it in my household thinking about cleanliness in terms of what
[3:28:30.800 --> 3:28:36.640]  you're doing good idea anyway and and then let's see how the news develops in
[3:28:36.640 --> 3:28:40.760]  the coming weeks this is dr. Nick baggage you can check out my website at
[3:28:40.760 --> 3:28:46.280]  earth pulse dot com earth pulse dot com is my site and we're on the Alex Jones

[3:29:50.680 --> 3:29:57.360]  all right folks here's the bad news we've already sold out of the 16 ounce
[3:29:57.360 --> 3:30:01.200]  immune gargle with the patented nano tech silver that's documented to knock
[3:30:01.200 --> 3:30:06.320]  out viruses and bacteria unlike anything else but we do still have in the
[3:30:06.320 --> 3:30:10.760]  three ounce of the one ounce for limited time the good news is we have the
[3:30:10.760 --> 3:30:15.040]  super blue toothpaste and the super silver toothpaste both that have the
[3:30:15.040 --> 3:30:19.760]  nano silver in them as well the super blue has tea tree that's also antiviral
[3:30:19.760 --> 3:30:23.880]  and antibacterial and high quality iodine and then of course the whitening
[3:30:23.880 --> 3:30:28.120]  has the nano silver but on top of that it has the above sea coral calcium that
[3:30:28.120 --> 3:30:32.000]  remelamorizes the teeth and so it's just the best toothpaste you're gonna find
[3:30:32.000 --> 3:30:36.240]  period it has the nano silver and we still have supplies of it though it'll
[3:30:36.240 --> 3:30:40.120]  sell out at current rates in about two weeks but despite that I'm keeping it at
[3:30:40.120 --> 3:30:44.720]  sale at 50% off so everybody can protect themselves with this high-quality
[3:30:44.720 --> 3:30:51.720]  product you've never used it before get yours today infowarstore.com infowarstore.com
[3:30:51.720 --> 3:30:55.560]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't
[3:30:55.560 --> 3:31:00.240]  tried it except for maybe the last week and a half and I told Alex I said man
[3:31:00.240 --> 3:31:03.120]  this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried he's like well what are you doing
[3:31:03.120 --> 3:31:06.040]  just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and tell people and so
[3:31:06.040 --> 3:31:11.560]  here I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best
[3:31:11.560 --> 3:31:15.400]  toothpaste I've ever tried and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of
[3:31:15.400 --> 3:31:19.680]  different toothpaste and it's fluoride free I think the big difference the
[3:31:19.680 --> 3:31:23.480]  game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with
[3:31:23.480 --> 3:31:27.440]  this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse
[3:31:27.440 --> 3:31:32.400]  out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this it feels so good it feels like it
[3:31:32.400 --> 3:31:36.640]  feels like good things are happening in my mouth in fact I find myself
[3:31:36.640 --> 3:31:41.200]  brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now
[3:31:41.200 --> 3:31:45.200]  because I like the way it feels
[3:31:51.760 --> 3:31:56.840]  it's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness and that
[3:31:56.840 --> 3:32:01.360]  we're seeing record food sales not just here but across the world that's good
[3:32:01.360 --> 3:32:06.600]  people need to be self-sufficient the average person is living hand-to-mouth
[3:32:06.600 --> 3:32:11.160]  paycheck-to-paycheck and doesn't know how to change their tire we need to
[3:32:11.160 --> 3:32:15.720]  reverse this trend and start getting prepared and that means even with just
[3:32:15.720 --> 3:32:20.320]  the basics even a three-week food supply that you know is always there that you
[3:32:20.320 --> 3:32:25.360]  only go to an emergencies that said boosting your immune system is just as

[3:33:16.000 --> 3:33:27.160]  war on for your mind with Nick Begich and welcome back it's good to be here on
[3:33:27.160 --> 3:33:32.520]  this Friday afternoon from my home in Anchorage Alaska and those of you that
[3:33:32.520 --> 3:33:36.960]  are traveling quite a bit these days you might want to think about slowing it
[3:33:36.960 --> 3:33:41.680]  down just pay attention to the news feeds and try and discern and I think that's a
[3:33:41.680 --> 3:33:46.720]  key word right now is discernment sorting out the fact from the fiction and
[3:33:46.720 --> 3:33:53.240]  so pay close attention to what you see look at some of the other news feeds and
[3:33:53.240 --> 3:33:57.800]  see how this these issues are being reported and what's being missed because
[3:33:57.800 --> 3:34:03.120]  it's it always appears that there's at times of great unrest there's a lot of
[3:34:03.120 --> 3:34:08.160]  distraction to kind of take us off of off of some of the stories that have
[3:34:08.160 --> 3:34:14.320]  occupied our time and attention and boy talk about changing the narrative in a
[3:34:14.320 --> 3:34:21.240]  hurry they certainly seen it in the last week to 10 days and and this is what
[3:34:21.240 --> 3:34:25.240]  we've seen way too much of and as I was saying before the break I never cry
[3:34:25.240 --> 3:34:29.680]  wolf right I mean you cry too many times people put paying attention and now
[3:34:29.680 --> 3:34:34.000]  because of the rush to news and the lack of news real news coverage in the
[3:34:34.000 --> 3:34:39.520]  mainstream is people are just not paying attention and so the reaction is a
[3:34:39.520 --> 3:34:46.200]  little bit on stall on some of this I started looking at sort of the global
[3:34:46.200 --> 3:34:51.200]  economic side of this and everything running counter to what the old rules
[3:34:51.200 --> 3:34:56.560]  would tell us and so huge amount of money dumped into the problem to try and
[3:34:56.560 --> 3:35:01.360]  solve it to the point where the biggest bubble ever has been created and the air
[3:35:01.360 --> 3:35:07.080]  is quickly going out of it at least at the moment and he and as quickly as it
[3:35:07.080 --> 3:35:12.320]  descended you know I mean they could announce some effort towards a cure for
[3:35:12.320 --> 3:35:17.600]  this thing and bounce it right back the other direction but at the same time
[3:35:17.600 --> 3:35:23.200]  remember the underlying economic factors going into this were not very good
[3:35:23.200 --> 3:35:28.560]  the other thing that was big news and and has kind of been lost in the shuffle
[3:35:28.560 --> 3:35:34.200]  is what was happening in the centralization of power and control
[3:35:34.200 --> 3:35:39.360]  because this is another manifestation of it whether this was by design or by
[3:35:39.360 --> 3:35:45.120]  default everyone's paying attention on how do you control over a billion people
[3:35:45.120 --> 3:35:50.600]  at a time stop and think about it a billion people you know an eighth of the
[3:35:50.600 --> 3:35:56.840]  population on the planet being pushed around you know and seeing how they
[3:35:56.840 --> 3:36:03.080]  react to being pushed around on steroids netted herded captured thrown into a
[3:36:03.080 --> 3:36:09.400]  pen how's that working out and how does that look going forward and this is what
[3:36:09.400 --> 3:36:13.720]  is also being looked at in the most controlled culture in the world the
[3:36:13.720 --> 3:36:19.680]  Chinese culture today remember a few weeks ago Hong Kong was about to
[3:36:19.680 --> 3:36:26.600]  disintegrate into riots chaos all of a sudden the streets are empty and quiet
[3:36:26.600 --> 3:36:32.000]  has returned to the land and everyone's being contained and controlled think
[3:36:32.000 --> 3:36:36.720]  about facial recognition think about currency as such currency for
[3:36:36.720 --> 3:36:41.120]  transmitting disease you know another reason to have electronic money right
[3:36:41.120 --> 3:36:47.040]  don't want to pass on the bad news even though most people don't use cash anymore
[3:36:47.040 --> 3:36:53.600]  but you know excuses upon excuses for shaving off civil liberties in exchange
[3:36:53.600 --> 3:36:58.200]  for safety and security when you look across China as the film clips are
[3:36:58.200 --> 3:37:03.720]  showing it's like empty those towns of millions millions airport to vacant no
[3:37:03.720 --> 3:37:11.200]  one moving total lockdown think at Japan right now all the schools are shut
[3:37:11.200 --> 3:37:16.520]  down you're going to see more of this most likely but again it was
[3:37:16.520 --> 3:37:21.600]  opportunistic the economy was already in deep trouble all what this did is give
[3:37:21.600 --> 3:37:29.040]  everyone an out to blame nature for the problem as opposed to reckless central
[3:37:29.040 --> 3:37:33.240]  bankers crushing the economy now one of the other things that that was
[3:37:33.240 --> 3:37:39.000]  happening is a lot of discussion about blockchain currency so they control
[3:37:39.000 --> 3:37:44.600]  money supply and handing that off to centralized bankers this is the this is
[3:37:44.600 --> 3:37:52.280]  the step you see of digitizing currencies a world crisis to restabilize
[3:37:52.280 --> 3:37:57.840]  the markets could be announced in some fashion by central bankers to try and
[3:37:57.840 --> 3:38:04.040]  cure this I think we'll see that in in the coming days because you're going to
[3:38:04.040 --> 3:38:09.280]  want to hear about solutions and people are going to panic in a lot of places
[3:38:09.280 --> 3:38:15.040]  because they will and this again the call for calm is to be deliberate in what
[3:38:15.040 --> 3:38:20.440]  we're doing be careful I don't antagonize the situation make worse but be
[3:38:20.440 --> 3:38:28.400]  mindful of what's going on around us the digital currency questions you know how
[3:38:28.400 --> 3:38:33.320]  do you bring that about pretty good way to do it if you stop and think about it
[3:38:33.320 --> 3:38:38.560]  and certainly places that are being impacted negatively economically
[3:38:38.560 --> 3:38:43.880]  right now I see it also now one of the other experiments in the background was
[3:38:43.880 --> 3:38:50.520]  money dropping into people's accounts in Hong Kong as a way to stimulate spending
[3:38:50.520 --> 3:38:56.040]  and stabilize the economy I think about that that's that whole thought of
[3:38:56.040 --> 3:39:00.560]  everybody gets a basic income kind of concept you know they get to test that
[3:39:00.560 --> 3:39:03.880]  out well people aren't working see if that can work out except no one's
[3:39:03.880 --> 3:39:11.080]  shopping so that's not the economy and I'm sure the deliveries are slow and
[3:39:11.080 --> 3:39:15.520]  these places right now and there it is Hong Kong giving every adult resident
[3:39:15.520 --> 3:39:20.080]  $200 no strings attached like the dividend you know a little bonus for
[3:39:20.080 --> 3:39:29.000]  breathing you know stop and think about all of this in the context again of a
[3:39:29.000 --> 3:39:35.000]  broader bigger picture and you see a lot of again distraction away from things
[3:39:35.000 --> 3:39:40.400]  that are really important and again further division you know all of these
[3:39:40.400 --> 3:39:47.240]  things that we're seeing play out are dividing us and tribalizing us to the
[3:39:47.240 --> 3:39:53.560]  point of fighting over everything and I don't want to see that that degradation
[3:39:53.560 --> 3:40:00.440]  happen and I don't think it has to it's it's time for leadership to stand up and
[3:40:00.440 --> 3:40:07.440]  do the things that are necessary to take our government back not give it up you
[3:40:07.440 --> 3:40:11.400]  know and the Trump administration was going to clean out the swamp don't be
[3:40:11.400 --> 3:40:16.240]  distracted make sure we're still progressing on that agenda as we also
[3:40:16.240 --> 3:40:21.600]  take steps to contain what what is happening here but let's not stop the
[3:40:21.600 --> 3:40:26.120]  work and I mean take a look at what else is happening you know you got
[3:40:26.120 --> 3:40:30.360]  elections in the Carolinas coming out you got super Tuesday coming up what's
[3:40:30.360 --> 3:40:34.800]  happening there is if Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination it's
[3:40:34.800 --> 3:40:43.440]  going to be a choice between socialism or not really socialism or not will be
[3:40:43.440 --> 3:40:48.760]  the question for the next election cycle that's a big deal and people aren't you
[3:40:48.760 --> 3:40:53.880]  know that's kind of been sidelined also this is a major deal is this what we're
[3:40:53.880 --> 3:40:58.680]  going to have in the country and what's happened that's allowed this you know I
[3:40:58.680 --> 3:41:07.600]  read one of the more recent polls on capitalism and people under 35 39% couple
[3:41:07.600 --> 3:41:14.120]  years ago supported capitalism as a system only 39% which shocked enough but
[3:41:14.120 --> 3:41:20.320]  it's down to 30% today think about that the general belief of the American
[3:41:20.320 --> 3:41:25.160]  young person towards capitalism is down to 30% thinking that's that's the right
[3:41:25.160 --> 3:41:32.000]  system you know and I would say this that predatory capitalism like what we
[3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:35.680]  saw when Russia first freed up you know the kind of capitalism is pretty
[3:41:35.680 --> 3:41:40.680]  vicious and the kind that operates by some of the psychopaths running some of
[3:41:40.680 --> 3:41:46.080]  the biggest corporations in the world in fact sociopaths people who don't know how
[3:41:46.080 --> 3:41:51.920]  to express normal human emotions run they say as many as two out of five major
[3:41:51.920 --> 3:41:56.760]  corporations and hold two out of five major leadership positions sociopaths
[3:41:56.760 --> 3:42:00.840]  because they're the ones you can just cut people to shreds on the way to the top
[3:42:00.840 --> 3:42:06.200]  whether it's an art, politics, science, business these are the hackers of the
[3:42:06.200 --> 3:42:11.560]  human soul the people that just ripped to shreds what we are in order to get to
[3:42:11.560 --> 3:42:17.080]  the top and that is not who we are that is not what we are and that's driven by
[3:42:17.080 --> 3:42:22.720]  fear and a lack of clear self-image about what we are created in the image of a
[3:42:22.720 --> 3:42:27.880]  creator greater than the sum of ourselves but we have to step into that in
[3:42:27.880 --> 3:42:33.000]  the middle of disaster when things are falling apart around us step into who
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:38.120]  we are not out of fear and anxiety but of strength and confidence knowing we
[3:42:38.120 --> 3:42:43.800]  reflect the very creation that is of what is important in the world today
[3:42:43.800 --> 3:42:48.880]  step into who we are as created in the image and likeness is not this is info
[3:42:48.880 --> 3:42:56.680]  wars across the Western world from high school to college sports to even the
[3:42:56.680 --> 3:43:02.840]  Olympics men biological men are winning almost all of the sporting events
[3:43:02.840 --> 3:43:08.800]  this is men invading women's spaces and bullying them and taking their rights
[3:43:08.800 --> 3:43:13.560]  away all in the name of the liberalism and openness and that every day I have
[3:43:13.560 --> 3:43:18.880]  stacks of news articles just like today UK team find under house arrest for
[3:43:18.880 --> 3:43:24.600]  asking trans police officers gender and it hurt their feelings UK mother spared
[3:43:24.600 --> 3:43:30.000]  jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay thousand pound fine because
[3:43:30.000 --> 3:43:36.600]  it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty that's the thought police if a
[3:43:36.600 --> 3:43:41.200]  leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason you get fined and you go to jail
[3:43:41.200 --> 3:43:46.120]  this is tyranny these people are bullies and it's sick and it's evil and it's
[3:43:46.120 --> 3:43:50.640]  part of a scientific anti-human takeover resist it speak out against it
[3:43:50.640 --> 3:43:57.520]  there can no longer be any doubt this coronavirus is serious on multiple
[3:43:57.520 --> 3:44:02.520]  levels it's very communicable it spreads very very fast it is killing a lot of
[3:44:02.520 --> 3:44:06.600]  people and the Chinese Communist government has covered up just how bad
[3:44:06.600 --> 3:44:11.120]  it is and the White House is now openly challenging them show our Trump's top
[3:44:11.120 --> 3:44:17.480]  scientist and so is Senator Cotton my friends now is the time to get prepared
[3:44:17.480 --> 3:44:22.360]  2020 is not a year to play games with the globalist are trying to create
[3:44:22.360 --> 3:44:26.840]  economic collapse race riots we don't know how bad this virus is gonna get
[3:44:26.840 --> 3:44:31.920]  here that's why listeners the info wars need to be prepared an info war store
[3:44:31.920 --> 3:44:37.560]  dot com has the products that make your life better and make you healthier we
[3:44:37.560 --> 3:44:41.200]  have the last of the immune gargle selling out as we speak we have high

[3:44:45.440 --> 3:44:53.000]  stock along with ultra 12 at infowarstore.com I also want to say
[3:44:53.000 --> 3:44:58.120]  that I'm happy to be helping out with an enterprise that is supported by all
[3:44:58.120 --> 3:45:02.560]  the work to help people be prepared and instead of just giving in to sickness
[3:45:02.560 --> 3:45:05.680]  care take care of their health take care of their nutrition in a way that
[3:45:05.680 --> 3:45:09.840]  contributes to greater vitality and I say that from personal experience because
[3:45:09.840 --> 3:45:14.280]  I know that the products that are being offered here I've tried them and I use
[3:45:14.280 --> 3:45:18.560]  them every day and that power pack that they have the ampm power pack well I
[3:45:18.560 --> 3:45:23.280]  wouldn't be so energetic this morning except that I have been on a regular
[3:45:23.280 --> 3:45:26.600]  customer in that regard I just wanted to start out by saying that because I
[3:45:26.600 --> 3:45:30.080]  think it's important to remember that beyond the theoretical ways in which
[3:45:30.080 --> 3:45:33.360]  we're trying to help equip people to think about these great events in the
[3:45:33.360 --> 3:45:38.840]  world one of the priorities has to be to take care of yourself remembering that
[3:45:38.840 --> 3:45:44.720]  our lives are a gift from God that he intends us to use for good purpose for
[3:45:44.720 --> 3:45:48.920]  our families and for our communities and right now folks who are willing to think
[3:45:48.920 --> 3:45:53.320]  like we do are critical to the future of America everybody's food I'm proud we're
[3:45:53.320 --> 3:45:57.440]  selling high quality food elections globalism the economy the bubble this is
[3:45:57.440 --> 3:46:01.680]  something you need on your checklist to have done but for me it just is a bummer
[3:46:01.680 --> 3:46:06.520]  to know that everybody's food and I had long discussions this morning over an
[3:46:06.520 --> 3:46:09.360]  hour long discussion with different individuals at different levels of this
[3:46:09.360 --> 3:46:13.080]  right now the folks run the plants to get the best idea we have but they want
[3:46:13.080 --> 3:46:16.400]  me to say six to eight weeks just so people aren't getting pissed but
[3:46:16.400 --> 3:46:20.880]  understand the last food company the biggest food company is now at hundreds
[3:46:20.880 --> 3:46:24.440]  of times their regular order and they were having discussions with me about
[3:46:24.440 --> 3:46:28.200]  stopping the promotion of food sales next week and at a certain point you're
[3:46:28.200 --> 3:46:31.560]  saying we're done because people are gonna take food orders out 10 weeks we
[3:46:31.560 --> 3:46:34.840]  don't want to sit on your money 10 weeks and then just all the weirdness that
[3:46:34.840 --> 3:46:38.520]  comes with that because we're honest under promise over deliver but technically
[3:46:38.520 --> 3:46:41.480]  it's gonna be six to eight weeks and we want you to get a great deal and feel
[3:46:41.480 --> 3:46:44.920]  like we took care of you so you come back again we want relationships with you
[3:46:44.920 --> 3:46:48.440]  we're not Satanist we're the opposite we don't screw people over we believe in
[3:46:48.440 --> 3:46:53.600]  Jesus Christ and we've been blessed by you we're all this together
[3:46:54.480 --> 3:46:59.920]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:46:59.920 --> 3:47:17.840]  and welcome back to this last segment Friday afternoon I'm sitting in for Alex
[3:47:17.840 --> 3:47:22.400]  today this is Dr. Nick Begich and I'm coming to you from Alaska I want to
[3:47:22.400 --> 3:47:27.760]  remind people to check out my website earth pulse dot com the AR THP you
[3:47:27.760 --> 3:47:32.320]  well see your pulse calm plenty of articles and information there there's
[3:47:32.320 --> 3:47:36.640]  nothing for sale there any longer I'm not selling anything on the website if
[3:47:36.640 --> 3:47:40.600]  you want to get books or videos you've got to go to the info war store because
[3:47:40.600 --> 3:47:44.880]  that's where my books and videos are and you support this network and you support
[3:47:44.880 --> 3:47:49.680]  my work when you do that and we all appreciate it and I want to really say
[3:47:49.680 --> 3:47:54.440]  thanks again a big shout out to everyone in the studio that makes it
[3:47:54.440 --> 3:48:00.640]  possible for me to do this from Alaska it's it's a you know technologically
[3:48:00.640 --> 3:48:06.200]  it's great you know what we can do now remotely and I appreciate everyone that
[3:48:06.200 --> 3:48:11.920]  makes this show happen again you know supporting this network's important it's
[3:48:11.920 --> 3:48:19.320]  what keeps it going by buying the products books videos supplements all the
[3:48:19.320 --> 3:48:23.800]  things that are promoted here are because they're good and because they were
[3:48:23.800 --> 3:48:28.960]  and so that's the best way to help and then spread the word you know let people
[3:48:28.960 --> 3:48:32.440]  know you know they shut off so many of our communication channels it's person
[3:48:32.440 --> 3:48:37.120]  to person one person at a time and that's the way things change perhaps it
[3:48:37.120 --> 3:48:40.920]  gets us back into conversations you know something that's been missing a
[3:48:40.920 --> 3:48:47.640]  dialogue that's not electronically interface so meet each other get
[3:48:47.640 --> 3:48:52.720]  together in person and support each other in all the ways that you can because
[3:48:52.720 --> 3:49:00.800]  ultimately we're not in this alone and no one's getting out alive at the end of
[3:49:00.800 --> 3:49:07.120]  the day so do it let's do it together the best we can and and not join the
[3:49:07.120 --> 3:49:11.840]  panic party of the left and let's keep our course straight and stay on the
[3:49:11.840 --> 3:49:16.600]  straight and narrow in terms of how we approach each other and the problems that
[3:49:16.600 --> 3:49:20.880]  the country in the world faces every day you know the differences if you lived
[3:49:20.880 --> 3:49:26.120]  in Mumbai India we used to be called Bombay the last 20 years you'd swear
[3:49:26.120 --> 3:49:29.680]  Armageddon had already happened because it's a horrible place if you've ever
[3:49:29.680 --> 3:49:34.080]  been there in terms of how people live it's just difficult very very difficult
[3:49:34.080 --> 3:49:42.280]  but in the West we're first experiencing you know the first beginning birth
[3:49:42.280 --> 3:49:48.200]  pains of a changed world and it's painful and how that goes down is going
[3:49:48.200 --> 3:49:52.440]  to be up to this generation the ones who are hearing this broadcast scattered
[3:49:52.440 --> 3:49:56.960]  around the world today because wherever you are within your sovereign
[3:49:56.960 --> 3:50:02.520]  boundaries taking back our governments is critical and that doesn't mean
[3:50:02.520 --> 3:50:06.800]  violence necessarily although perhaps in some parts world is the only option
[3:50:06.800 --> 3:50:12.000]  we're watching that play out all over the world but where there's still the
[3:50:12.000 --> 3:50:17.760]  semblance of democracies and democratic republics like ours we still have a
[3:50:17.760 --> 3:50:21.720]  fighting chance and a couple things I want to say because I've been a big
[3:50:21.720 --> 3:50:27.320]  commentator 25 years on the technocracy and technology generally I want to
[3:50:27.320 --> 3:50:31.160]  speak against technology just for a moment one particular piece of
[3:50:31.160 --> 3:50:35.960]  technology that the Trump administration could engage an executive order today
[3:50:35.960 --> 3:50:42.600]  and it is to get rid of electronic voting paper ballots only they have to
[3:50:42.600 --> 3:50:47.680]  mark with an ink pen the most important fundamental aspect of a democracy is
[3:50:47.680 --> 3:50:52.120]  its voting process and no matter where you are in the world get rid of
[3:50:52.120 --> 3:50:59.200]  electronic voting all the way around pens ink and paper and recounts are the
[3:50:59.200 --> 3:51:03.320]  only way that democracies and democratic republics or whatever form of
[3:51:03.320 --> 3:51:08.160]  government you've adopted that includes an election election process you better
[3:51:08.160 --> 3:51:12.600]  keep control of the ballot and some things should never be automated should
[3:51:12.600 --> 3:51:16.640]  never be mechanized and if we have to wait a couple of days for the vote count
[3:51:16.640 --> 3:51:22.400]  I'd rather wait a couple of days and know my republic is intact an important
[3:51:22.400 --> 3:51:28.280]  issue can we do it by executive order I bet you we can can we insist on cleaning
[3:51:28.280 --> 3:51:32.200]  up the election as a bipartisan issue before this election cycle at least
[3:51:32.200 --> 3:51:36.360]  let's make sure the sanctity of the voting booth is safe even though the
[3:51:36.360 --> 3:51:41.640]  propaganda machines on both sides of this election are in full bloom and full
[3:51:41.640 --> 3:51:47.560]  more let's at least make sure when we go in and we mark our ballots with an ink
[3:51:47.560 --> 3:51:52.440]  pen that the vote counts and that if we have to recount it we have a way to do
[3:51:52.440 --> 3:51:58.080]  really really important stuff ladies and gentlemen I would say this also you know
[3:51:58.080 --> 3:52:01.120]  there's been a lot of attack on the democratic side of the Electoral
[3:52:01.120 --> 3:52:05.240]  College which is again a big part of what's coming up in the fall is the
[3:52:05.240 --> 3:52:10.720]  Electoral College constitutional setup and people say well it negates the
[3:52:10.720 --> 3:52:16.040]  popular vote that's correct and it's cut both ways sometimes Democrats have won
[3:52:16.040 --> 3:52:20.880]  and sometimes Republicans have won without the popular vote but what it
[3:52:20.880 --> 3:52:27.160]  forces is it forces a balance between rural voters and urban voters between
[3:52:27.160 --> 3:52:33.040]  big states and small states by forcing a discussion to compromise without this
[3:52:33.040 --> 3:52:36.960]  just by popular vote New York, California, Florida will decide most
[3:52:36.960 --> 3:52:42.240]  elections and soon Texas as well but if you think about the electoral process
[3:52:42.240 --> 3:52:47.000]  what it does is make sure there is a lively invigorated debate that it's not
[3:52:47.000 --> 3:52:51.680]  mob rule and that it does work and there was a reason our founding fathers
[3:52:51.680 --> 3:52:56.760]  adopted this one was to keep rural and urban balances which would be thrown out
[3:52:56.760 --> 3:53:01.880]  because the urban populations would dominate election cycles on the
[3:53:01.880 --> 3:53:06.760]  presidential level this is why we develop the form of government that we
[3:53:06.760 --> 3:53:11.040]  have we have three branches of government judiciary to keep track of the
[3:53:11.040 --> 3:53:16.480]  other two the executive to manage the flow and operation of government and the
[3:53:16.480 --> 3:53:22.480]  legislative split into two branches one for population driven advantage and one
[3:53:22.480 --> 3:53:29.200]  driven not by population but by a state so that we have a balance between the
[3:53:29.200 --> 3:53:34.800]  legislative so it's not always about just population it's also about balance
[3:53:34.800 --> 3:53:39.560]  and that's what's made this thing work for over 200 years we need to maintain
[3:53:39.560 --> 3:53:43.840]  the balance the constitutional balance that we have right now and start
[3:53:43.840 --> 3:53:50.080]  reclaiming lost ground as we've lost ground our ability to assemble in the
[3:53:50.080 --> 3:53:53.640]  public square of the 21st century which is where we are right now if we're
[3:53:53.640 --> 3:53:58.680]  looking at this electronically this is how news is shared how information is
[3:53:58.680 --> 3:54:04.640]  shared and news outlets are being chopped off our voices are being chopped off
[3:54:04.640 --> 3:54:09.320]  free speech is in danger our right to assemble is in danger our right to free
[3:54:09.320 --> 3:54:15.120]  assembly free religious thinking is in danger it's a risk the foundations of
[3:54:15.120 --> 3:54:22.080]  what we are and and what is driving that risk is fear and anxiety and I
[3:54:22.080 --> 3:54:27.760]  understand that but there's a time to understand what fear and anxiety does it
[3:54:27.760 --> 3:54:32.160]  shuts down our higher capacities as human beings our ability to think clearly
[3:54:32.160 --> 3:54:36.560]  our ability to reason our ability to work our way through our difficulties
[3:54:36.560 --> 3:54:42.960]  individually and as a culture or society so thinking clearly requires a
[3:54:42.960 --> 3:54:48.800]  calmness a way of viewing the world so that we can look and find our solutions
[3:54:48.800 --> 3:54:52.600]  which are in front of us we're always facing challenging times in this
[3:54:52.600 --> 3:54:57.840]  century the last century in every century to come this is no different but
[3:54:57.840 --> 3:55:03.400]  rise into what we are a cart and do what we can each individually do and that's
[3:55:03.400 --> 3:55:10.560]  what changes the world and I've said it on this program for 25 years now Alex
[3:55:10.560 --> 3:55:17.520]  can celebrate 25 years quarter of a century of trying to make change and
[3:55:17.520 --> 3:55:23.400]  it's not over until our last breath is taken and and that's not to say it in a
[3:55:23.400 --> 3:55:28.080]  fatalistic way because I am an eternal optimist or I wouldn't do this I believe
[3:55:28.080 --> 3:55:33.840]  that we're gonna overcome the obstacles that we face that we will emerge out of
[3:55:33.840 --> 3:55:38.680]  the circumstances that we face stronger than what we were before and I also
[3:55:38.680 --> 3:55:43.320]  believe that at these particular times is when we rise into our higher
[3:55:43.320 --> 3:55:48.160]  potentials and I believe that sits on the horizon today new leadership will
[3:55:48.160 --> 3:55:53.880]  arise new voices will take home new ideas will take form and solutions will
[3:55:53.880 --> 3:56:00.560]  emerge out of the soup of of current despair but we have to stay with it
[3:56:00.560 --> 3:56:05.000]  support the network support each other do the things we need to do this weekend
[3:56:05.000 --> 3:56:10.360]  going into the weekend let's not have a panic party let's be deliberate think
[3:56:10.360 --> 3:56:14.120]  where you're at think things through take a look at what's going on around the
[3:56:14.120 --> 3:56:18.640]  world and begin taking deliberate steps that are the right steps for you and
[3:56:18.640 --> 3:56:25.240]  your family think about the fact that if you're driven strictly by fear you're
[3:56:25.240 --> 3:56:31.360]  still not seeing the solution and the solutions are around this but they're
[3:56:31.360 --> 3:56:36.560]  not going to be in isolation they're not going to be hiding in the bunker they're
[3:56:36.560 --> 3:56:41.560]  going to be making sure that we have the things that we need going forward we
[3:56:41.560 --> 3:56:45.760]  have to rethink this thing we have to look at the motivations of the mainstream
[3:56:45.760 --> 3:56:49.720]  media take a look at whether they're serving their purpose of a free press
[3:56:49.720 --> 3:56:54.720]  not free to say whatever you want free to make a difference free to make sure
[3:56:54.720 --> 3:56:58.440]  we have an informed electorate that we might make good decisions that might
[3:56:58.440 --> 3:57:02.520]  guide our country guide our families and guide our communities in 21st century
[3:57:02.520 --> 3:57:08.480]  we're not done yet there's a lot to do the current circumstances will come and
[3:57:08.480 --> 3:57:14.840]  go as news feeds and new cycles do may change things forever who knows what
[3:57:14.840 --> 3:57:17.640]  events will do that because they're happening every day somewhere in the
