[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:04.000 --> 00:08.000]  There is a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:12.000 --> 00:16.000]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is a parent.
[00:23.000 --> 00:25.000]  Alex Jones.
[00:25.000 --> 00:30.000]  Stop! Russian, stop!
[00:33.000 --> 00:35.000]  Before wars comes to mind.
[00:35.000 --> 00:57.000]  Reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:57.000 --> 01:04.000]  Our government has been in close contact with the mayor of Ottawa and municipal and provincial officials.
[01:04.000 --> 01:13.000]  So far, the RCMP has mobilized nearly 300 officers to support the Ottawa Police Services and is ready to do more.
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.000]  Rather than face the Canadian people, Justin Trudeau is sickening his police on them.
[01:19.000 --> 01:28.000]  Governments have been hiring globalist players and thugs for years. Meet Peter Slowly, known for being woke.
[01:28.000 --> 01:37.000]  Seven years ago as deputy police chief, Peter Slowly said that being black made him a suitable candidate for Toronto's next police chief.
[01:37.000 --> 01:50.000]  And claimed a more important factor was his experience as a United Nations peacekeeper, an international police force known for raping and pillaging communities under the flag of peace.
[01:50.000 --> 01:57.000]  It was reported that there was much animosity when Slowly was not chosen to be Toronto's first black police chief.
[01:57.000 --> 02:07.000]  And a year later, he resigned. During his resignation speech, he bragged about tempting offers coming from the international private sector.
[02:07.000 --> 02:14.000]  And went on immediately to join the company Deloitte, whose CEO sits on the board of directors at Pfizer.
[02:14.000 --> 02:22.000]  And who was awarded over 40 million dollars by the CDC to build a vaccine management system.
[02:22.000 --> 02:30.000]  A couple months before the COVID-19 scammedemic, Peter Slowly was made chief of the Ottawa police.
[02:30.000 --> 02:41.000]  While the world celebrates the inspiring human spirit coming from the people of Canada, their own police steal their gasoline to freeze them out.
[02:41.000 --> 02:44.000]  Families and children.
[02:44.000 --> 02:58.000]  And the foundations of an incoming false flag are now being identified. Meet Peter Downing, a former cop for the RCMP who was given full pay and a clean record after a criminal conviction.
[02:58.000 --> 03:07.000]  Downing is the head of WEGZIT, an Alberta separist movement seeking to overrule Canadian law with decrees set by the United Nations.
[03:07.000 --> 03:16.000]  And funded by a woman who sits on the board of the Atlantic Council. The Atlantic Council founded CrowdStrike, which ties them to Hillary Clinton.
[03:16.000 --> 03:25.000]  They are funded by George Soros and the Ukraine's Barisma. They are considered a threat to constitutional order by the Russian government.
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  And they fund Peter Downing's WEGZIT.
[03:28.000 --> 03:37.000]  WEGZIT has made itself a part of the Ottawa protests and their connections to George Soros and the RCMP should be cause for alarm.
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.000]  People need to be on the lookout for state-sponsored shenanigans.
[03:41.000 --> 03:56.000]  We've been told that one of the triggers or indicators where we know that they are going to physically move against us and start arresting us is when our media goes down.
[03:56.000 --> 04:07.000]  When all of our telecommunications devices do go down, when we go fully black, the next phase of this will be the public order units will move in on us and start kettling.
[04:07.000 --> 04:18.000]  This is it. If there's a media blackout of everybody that you're connected to with this freedom convoy, that's your trigger that you know something is up.
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.000]  And I would encourage you to make arrangements and immediately start heading to Ottawa.
[04:23.000 --> 04:43.000]  Trudeau's Liberals are now scurrying to pass their new anti-hate laws straight out of communist China, where a Canadian can be fined $70,000 in thrown in jail for up to four years for the crime of posting anything on the internet that the government deems inappropriate.
[04:43.000 --> 05:00.000]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[05:00.000 --> 05:12.000]  Sold out for months, X3 is now back in stock. Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[05:12.000 --> 05:26.000]  It's not the soil anymore. Most of the ocean is contaminated, but when you get high quality triiodine, all three of the healthy types together, it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly your immune system.
[05:26.000 --> 05:36.000]  So, X3, the only triiodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off at InfoWars.com.
[05:36.000 --> 05:44.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body, it takes about two weeks to get it on average, you really need to experience X3.
[05:44.000 --> 05:57.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it, but particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body, it's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[05:57.000 --> 06:22.000]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50% off for them.
[06:22.000 --> 06:32.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[06:32.000 --> 06:40.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  The power of their source.
[06:44.000 --> 06:55.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this February 9th, 2022, Wednesday edition.
[06:55.000 --> 07:05.000]  I normally get ready for about four hours in the morning, but today I had a lot of family stuff going on and some very important business developments to fund the operation that were very positive.
[07:05.000 --> 07:15.000]  And I only spent about an hour today reading news and getting ready, so I got in here late and I was going over the 500 articles or so they'd printed off for me.
[07:15.000 --> 07:17.000]  And I only got through two of the stacks.
[07:17.000 --> 07:18.000]  Normally I'd go through everything.
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  I didn't go through it today.
[07:20.000 --> 07:27.000]  Just the two stacks I went through have chills shooting up and down my spine right now.
[07:27.000 --> 07:35.000]  Whoa. I mean, wow.
[07:35.000 --> 07:41.000]  Look at just the top two stories.
[07:41.000 --> 07:58.000]  Kaiser quietly yesterday released an email to their shareholders warning them of bad clinical trial news coming out that they believe is going to hurt the forced injection program.
[07:58.000 --> 08:03.000]  Now, we already knew they suppressed the bad clinical data, which is a huge felony crime.
[08:03.000 --> 08:11.000]  It also blowers the documents. We already know that the British Medical Journal four months ago came out and said, this is one of the greatest crimes ever.
[08:11.000 --> 08:16.000]  You will discredit vaccines for generations. You need to pull it.
[08:16.000 --> 08:18.000]  But did you ever see that on the news?
[08:18.000 --> 08:20.000]  You got to share that on Instagram or Twitter.
[08:20.000 --> 08:23.000]  Yo ass is banned.
[08:23.000 --> 08:31.000]  Think of the people that work at Twitter and Facebook committing those crimes to cover that out to black that out.
[08:31.000 --> 08:39.000]  They ran a ship over there at Facebook and they should be because if you stay part of this now, folks, you are definitely guilty.
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.000]  Maybe you didn't know before if you were an executive at Facebook or Twitter, you do now.
[08:44.000 --> 08:56.000]  People over at Google and they're just doubling down with the cover ups, but not Pfizer because in their corporate religion of evil, they've got to tell the owners what's really happening.
[08:56.000 --> 09:02.000]  So they just made their 90 plus billion dollars the last year of nightmare forced medical tyranny.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  And now they release and read the whole thing on info wars.com.
[09:06.000 --> 09:15.000]  That's hard news directly to their shareholders saying quote,
[09:15.000 --> 09:24.000]  Pfizer quietly adds language warning that unfavorable preclinical clinical or safety data may impact business.
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  Boy, that's a mouthful.
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.000]  Let me read that to you again.
[09:28.000 --> 09:37.000]  Pfizer quietly adds language warning that unfavorable preclinical or clinical or safety data may impact business.
[09:37.000 --> 09:48.000]  Oh, you mean because for the last year you've been trying to suppress since day one the clinical data in the UK going back 18 months ago and the clinical data here going back 13 months ago.
[09:48.000 --> 10:00.000]  And there's all these hundreds of lawsuits in two different federal courts and then the appellate court have ordered them to release the documents and they said no.
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  And the court said release 500 pages.
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  The 500 pages were the first couple weeks in the US alone.
[10:09.000 --> 10:15.000]  Couple thousand deaths directly confirmed not in bears by the doctors by Pfizer.
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.000]  Tens of thousands of miscarriages tens of thousands of heart attacks.
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  And that's what got put on record.
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  Even Harvard estimates 1% end up getting properly reported.
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  But that your pipe and smoke it.
[10:29.000 --> 10:58.000]  So the CDC knew in October to 2020 months before anybody got injected in the US that it's going to cause blood clots heart attacks microcarditis because the top virologist and the top epidemiologist and the top vaccine experts in the world said we've tried to spike protein before in rat studies and guinea pig studies and mice studies and primate studies and it kills the majority of them with blood clots and heart attacks and cancer.
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.000]  Very quickly.
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  Now humans are tough.
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  You can take on a lot more poison than most animals.
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.000]  That's a little secret about us is we're pretty bad ass.
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.000]  But we are being hit and hit incredibly hard.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  And they all think it's funny.
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.000]  The psycho death cult murderers.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  I mean there's a reason the New Zealand prime minister looks like a psychotic vampire.
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  He's a Davos graduate and literally wants human depopulation.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  She admits publicly.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  So she wants you to die, but she wants you to live.
[11:33.000 --> 11:34.000]  Take this shot.
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  Not very hard to figure out what's happening.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  It's like if somebody is a convicted child molester.
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  And they tell you they want to come to drag queen story time with your elementary students and you let them.
[11:43.000 --> 11:53.000]  You're now aiding and abetting because obviously someone who's convicted child molester is dressing up like a clown to come see children because they want to molest them.
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  Well, when someone like Bill Gates tells you he wants to depopulate the planet.
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  And when she says she wants to depopulate the planet and attends those events.
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.000]  And now she wants to lock you down and put something in your body folks in a two plus two.
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.000]  It just is.
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  It's not just putting two plus two together.
[12:09.000 --> 12:12.000]  It's just prima facie on its face.
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  Now that's just one of the articles.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.000]  Pretty massively bomb show.
[12:19.000 --> 12:26.000]  Here's one just as big.
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.000]  CDC considers increasing time between vaccines to cut risk of heart inflammation, heart attacks and death.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  They're saying this themselves.
[12:34.000 --> 12:37.000]  Boston Local 25 is reporting.
[12:37.000 --> 12:42.000]  And notice what the CDC and others are doing in Pfizer is they're putting this out to their shareholders.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  They're putting it out real quietly in local TV stations.
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.000]  So it's a public notice of what they're doing to you, but they don't want to put it on the Joe Rogan show.
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  They want to say he's wrong when he tells 20 million people the truth.
[12:54.000 --> 13:01.000]  And under law, under British common law, which is the basis of a constitutional rights, if they give you a notice, though, they have less liability.
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.000]  So they notice it.
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.000]  Remember the first six months of the deadly injections?
[13:07.000 --> 13:14.000]  Nurses and doctors and pharmacy owners would open up the vaccine injection paperwork to buy law supposed to be in there.
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  It was blank as pure as a driven snow.
[13:17.000 --> 13:23.000]  Now they finally added six months later, OK, cause heart attacks and heart swelling and some other things to cover their ass.
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.000]  In fact, all that's on the sheet is the horrible things that can do to you now.
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  Not what's in it because that's all secret.
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.000]  And Pfizer and Moderna, they all got it's a secret deal that Trump signed with them.
[13:33.000 --> 13:39.000]  One of Trump's biggest follies, one of Trump's biggest black marks.
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  And now they have a secret agreement with the government.
[13:41.000 --> 13:44.000]  Congress can't even see that since when the hell does that go on?
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.000]  And all these other countries signed the secret agreement except Brazil didn't.
[13:49.000 --> 13:58.000]  And now the UN has a war crimes court open for crimes against humanity and are trying to get an indictment of Bolsonaro.
[13:58.000 --> 14:03.000]  Because he didn't let them rape the hell out of his people.
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  Well, I wish we had Bolsonaro.
[14:06.000 --> 14:12.000]  I mean, I think Trump's a good guy overall, but Bolsonaro's so much more smarter, so much stronger.
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.000]  We need a hundred Bolsonaro's as presidents around the world and prime ministers.
[14:17.000 --> 14:22.000]  We sure as hell don't need a hundred Joe Biden's.
[14:22.000 --> 14:38.000]  We need a billion Tucker Carlson's and a couple billion more Joe Rogan's and a couple billion more Naomi Wolf's and people like Tulsi Gabbards.
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  And you are the Joe Rogan or the Tulsi Gabbard out there.
[14:41.000 --> 14:47.000]  You are the Tucker Carlson. You are the Bolsonaro.
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.000]  Well, it got up to five African presidents.
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.000]  Most of them turned out were doctors because in Africa they prize being a doctor over a lawyer.
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  I think we should have more doctors as president here.
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  Five African presidents all ended up dying.
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  Some of them shot killed blown up.
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  Others mysteriously just fell over dead when they wouldn't let Pfizer and Moderna in.
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  Oh, and you know what happened in Africa?
[15:11.000 --> 15:16.000]  They have the lowest COVID rate and lowest death rate in the world because they won't take the shots.
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  People who have the most shots, they've got the highest infection hospitalization and death rate,
[15:20.000 --> 15:26.000]  but they run these lying headlines at Nauseum everywhere like this one out of the Washington Post.
[15:26.000 --> 15:32.000]  COVID deaths highest in a year as Omicron targets the unvaccinated and the elderly.
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  But it's not the unvaccinated that are dying.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  It is the vaccinated.
[15:36.000 --> 15:41.000]  That's the real numbers, but they don't care because they're your enemy and they're lying to you.
[15:41.000 --> 15:47.000]  Now, Pfizer's having to come out admit to its shareholders, get ready for really bad news to come out,
[15:47.000 --> 15:53.000]  because more documents are coming out and we know what you murdering, eugenics trash did,
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  and you will be held accountable.
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.000]  Sold out for months, X3 is now back in stock.
[16:03.000 --> 16:08.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing,

[17:22.000 --> 17:27.000]  Some of the proprietary super-ingredients behind Brain Force Ultra include
[17:27.000 --> 17:31.000]  Goronaseep, which is loaded with energy compounds and antioxidants
[17:31.000 --> 17:34.000]  that have been used by Amazonian tribes for centuries,
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.000]  AlphaGPC, a natural compound found in the brain that delivers an essential nutrient, Koli,
[17:40.000 --> 17:44.000]  and Ginkoli, which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant content.
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  This product is more than twice the servings of our Brain Force Plus as well,

[18:27.000 --> 18:32.000]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps,
[18:32.000 --> 18:35.000]  the traders know they can shut us down by force.
[18:35.000 --> 18:38.000]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  So be it.
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  Make them silence us by force.

[19:01.000 --> 19:04.000]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.000]  that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere.
[19:08.000 --> 19:11.000]  But if you look at all the different studies reports about NASA
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.000]  and other governments, other agencies,
[19:13.000 --> 19:16.000]  they all disagree on what's really happening with the client.
[19:16.000 --> 19:22.000]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.000]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[19:25.000 --> 19:28.000]  But notice, first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  and then it's going to be global warming
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  and that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to.
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[19:34.000 --> 19:38.000]  But did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.000]  when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  and Bill Gates and the UN?
[19:43.000 --> 19:44.000]  They have.
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  Weather control trees from 1979.
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.000]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.000]  Back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  for an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  to control the weather.
[19:57.000 --> 20:21.000]  This man-made climate change is real.
[20:21.000 --> 20:50.000]  I really feel sorry for people that haven't seen the light.
[20:50.000 --> 20:57.000]  It's nothing more beautiful than that light.
[20:57.000 --> 21:01.000]  Those that saw the light, our ancestors, recreated it in cathedrals
[21:01.000 --> 21:04.000]  with beautiful stained glass.
[21:04.000 --> 21:07.000]  It looks just like that, but more beautiful than you could imagine.
[21:07.000 --> 21:15.000]  The fractals beyond the most beautiful kaleidoscope you could ever imagine.
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.000]  I've seen the light.
[21:18.000 --> 21:23.000]  I've seen the light.
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.000]  I feel sorry for our enemies.
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  They haven't seen the light.
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  I saw the light.
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  I saw the light.
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  No more darkness.
[21:33.000 --> 21:36.000]  No more night.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  Now I'm so happy.
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.000]  No sorrow inside.
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  Praise the Lord.
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  I saw the light.
[21:45.000 --> 21:50.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live
[21:50.000 --> 21:55.000]  February 9th, 2022 transmission.
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  There's no way to do this justice.
[21:57.000 --> 22:04.000]  I mean, HIV levels are suddenly exploding worldwide,
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  and suddenly it's much deadlier and killing people much faster.
[22:07.000 --> 22:10.000]  We told you it's the injection.
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.000]  Top scientists told you two years ago.
[22:13.000 --> 22:18.000]  There's videos at Bandot video where I go on for hours with top scientists
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  warning everyone.
[22:21.000 --> 22:24.000]  And sure as hell, it's happening.
[22:24.000 --> 22:29.000]  They're like, oh, guess what?
[22:29.000 --> 22:33.000]  COVID vaccine could increase risk of HIV infection.
[22:33.000 --> 22:42.000]  Wow, three minutes ago.
[22:42.000 --> 22:46.000]  Of course, they warned you back actually at the time.
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.000]  That's actually an old article.
[22:48.000 --> 22:56.000]  You see, they're always throwing at your face.
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  That's a good six, seven months after I first broke that news.
[23:00.000 --> 23:07.000]  They even covered their ass there, didn't they?
[23:07.000 --> 23:11.000]  I mean, how do you just cover something like that and just move on to the next thing?
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  Because each one of these is like that.
[23:13.000 --> 23:17.000]  This is a full-out assault.
[23:17.000 --> 23:23.000]  And then I've got news in Australia, news in Europe, news in the U.K.,
[23:23.000 --> 23:26.000]  news in Canada, and news in the U.S.
[23:26.000 --> 23:29.000]  That sounds like it's something you'd hear out of
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  Communist China or North Korea or you read about in a history book
[23:32.000 --> 23:36.000]  in the Soviet Union.
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  We told you yesterday how the Capitol Police have set up offices all over the country
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.000]  in fake companies, repair companies,
[23:44.000 --> 23:50.000]  and then they break into people's offices and spy on them in Congress in the Capitol
[23:50.000 --> 23:56.000]  at night and on the weekends like Nixon's plumbers, but on a much wider scale.
[23:56.000 --> 24:01.000]  Now they've confirmed they're reading members of Congress's mail.
[24:01.000 --> 24:05.000]  They're intercepting their mail, sending it to the Justice Department
[24:05.000 --> 24:17.000]  where they then read it.
[24:17.000 --> 24:22.000]  Louis Gohmert's upset about it, and he should be.
[24:22.000 --> 24:23.000]  And they admit it.
[24:23.000 --> 24:24.000]  They go, yeah, we read your mail.
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  What are you going to do about it?
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  And then what's happening in Canada?
[24:30.000 --> 24:34.000]  The prime minister that's sat on TV, he wants to be a dictator
[24:34.000 --> 24:37.000]  on his dictatorship, close quote,
[24:37.000 --> 24:42.000]  that he admires the, quote, basic dictatorship of Xi Jinping,
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  the guy that says you shouldn't be allowed to have free speech,
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  the guy that wants to forcibly inject you or you can't leave your house,
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  the guy that says if you haven't had all your injections,
[24:49.000 --> 24:55.000]  no one can come to your home, gatherings of five or more are illegal.
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  That's martial law.
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  I now have so many clubs I can't even play them all,
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  but we'll play some next segment, a few,
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  saying you are terrorist, you are traitors,
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  and you're going to be arrested,
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  and we're going to put you in prison
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  if you come out and peacefully protest
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  and say you don't want to be forcibly injected.
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  I mean, the bottom fell out.
[25:17.000 --> 25:22.000]  They've gone all the way, and I've got CNN and MSNBC,
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  all attacking the truckers and calling them terrorists as well.
[25:26.000 --> 25:27.000]  I mean, it's full on folks.
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  They know we've broken with them.
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.000]  They know we're awake, no one's watching them.
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  They have 100,000 viewers on average.
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  We have three, four million viewers on average.
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  Joe has more like 20 million on average now.
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  Joe Rogan, and that's a concern.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  In fact, by the way, Joe showed me some of the real numbers,
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  which they haven't released yet,
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  and he told me not to tell you until they decide to release them.
[25:46.000 --> 25:51.000]  But let me tell you, it's not 11 million people downloading it.
[25:51.000 --> 25:58.000]  It's 11 million downloading the average in the United States.
[25:58.000 --> 26:03.000]  So, wow, wait till they learn these numbers.
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  Stratospheric.
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  I've never heard of anything this big.
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.000]  We had 80-something million different IP addresses at InfoWars
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  in a three-day period during the 2016 election.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  That was the biggest we ever were.
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  We had days with 20-plus million people on the site.
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  Drudge is bigger than that, but that's the biggest we've ever been.
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.000]  Rogan, he showed me the numbers,
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.000]  but I'm going to shut up now because he said, don't tell people yet.
[26:29.000 --> 26:34.000]  But, of course, Rumble's trying to double down on their offer in higher Rogan.
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  Anywhere Rogan goes, he's going to make hundreds of millions of dollars.
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.000]  But that's not what Joe cares about.
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.000]  Believe me, and I'll leave it at that.
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  Do you have any idea how much money Rogan already made
[26:45.000 --> 26:49.000]  over the years of sponsorships in all the companies he's endorsed?
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  I mean, do you have any idea he's made way more money on that
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  than the Spotify deal?
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  He owns a billionaire.
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  I'm going to stop right there.
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.000]  But he doesn't care about what they're doing, and he's laughing at them.
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  Sorry, I'm digressing.
[27:04.000 --> 27:10.000]  InfoWars is the real black sheep in battled and running down like an old clock here
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  if we don't get prayer and support.
[27:12.000 --> 27:18.000]  And boy, do all of you not get incredible credit, ladies and gentlemen,
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  for your support of this broadcast over the years,
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  so we'd be here now at this critical time.
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.000]  I mean, you talk about absolute vindication.
[27:28.000 --> 27:34.000]  Absolute vindication with everything coming out we've talked about.
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.000]  And now if we could just stop the nuclear war and arrest the head of Pfizer and Fauci
[27:38.000 --> 27:41.000]  and have a war crime tribunal, we could beat this thing really quick.
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  But the prophecy must be fulfilled.
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  The devil will get his 15 minutes of fame.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  But it's a very short time.
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  Is it a year from now, 10 years from now, 20 years from now?
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.000]  But this is definitely the mark of the beast precursors.
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  This is definitely the shape of things to come very soon.
[27:57.000 --> 28:03.000]  And the resistance we build now that will get sucked under and beaten for a season.
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.000]  We'll lose a couple quarters in the game.
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.000]  We'll lose a few periods.
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.000]  We'll lose five or six innings.
[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  But we're going to win in the end.
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.000]  So I can tell you this is all incredible.
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.000]  It is amazing.
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.000]  But all over the world, the forced injections are you go to jail.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  Not, oh, you can't leave your house.
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.000]  No, you're going to jail if you leave your house.
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  Australia and Austria.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  Their names sound the same, different parts of the world.
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.000]  But yes, they're going on the alphabet with the A countries first.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  Yes, America's next.
[28:41.000 --> 28:46.000]  You know, Biden tried all that, but it didn't work.
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  It's not like, oh, the science now says you don't need masks.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  The science now says you don't need shots.
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  So they're trying to back off because they know they woke you up.
[28:53.000 --> 28:59.000]  Yeah, you bit off more, you can chew, you damn devils.
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  Sold out for months.
[29:01.000 --> 29:04.000]  X3 is now back in stock.
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing,
[29:06.000 --> 29:08.000]  our products are game changing.
[29:08.000 --> 29:11.000]  And so many people are deficient in iodine.
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  It's not the soil anymore.
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.000]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[29:15.000 --> 29:20.000]  But when you get high quality tri iodine, all three of the healthy types together,
[29:20.000 --> 29:24.000]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido,
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  but most importantly, your immune system.
[29:26.000 --> 29:30.000]  So, X3, the only tri iodine on the market,
[29:30.000 --> 29:36.000]  highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off at mforeshore.com.

[29:41.000 --> 29:44.000]  you really need to experience X3.
[29:44.000 --> 29:47.000]  And those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.

[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  because it's amazing what does for your body.
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen.
[29:54.000 --> 29:57.000]  And it funds the infowar, a true 360 win.
[29:57.000 --> 30:01.000]  So again, X3 back in stock, 50% off for a limited time.
[30:01.000 --> 30:06.000]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.000]  to leading a healthier life.
[30:08.000 --> 30:11.000]  Infowars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your system
[30:11.000 --> 30:13.000]  with a supplement that contains both.
[30:13.000 --> 30:17.000]  This infowars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips
[30:17.000 --> 30:20.000]  should be your next purchase from the infowars store.
[30:20.000 --> 30:25.000]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals
[30:25.000 --> 30:27.000]  that contain the rose plant seeds.
[30:27.000 --> 30:32.000]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[30:32.000 --> 30:38.000]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.000]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves,
[30:40.000 --> 30:44.000]  you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition,
[30:44.000 --> 30:47.000]  immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.000]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate,
[30:50.000 --> 30:53.000]  even in affluent populations like here in America.
[30:53.000 --> 30:57.000]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com

[33:42.000 --> 33:44.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have found the most demonized,
[33:44.000 --> 33:48.000]  light about censored broadcast in the world.
[33:48.000 --> 33:50.000]  And if you go anywhere on the internet, people are saying,
[33:50.000 --> 33:53.000]  we love Alex Jones, but where is he? Well, you're the folks smart enough
[33:53.000 --> 33:57.000]  to know how to come find the show at man.videoandinfowars.com.
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  And that may seem simple to you, but there's a lot of people
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.000]  that just get habituated to watching and seeing and hearing things
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  on Instagram, on Twitter, on Google.
[34:05.000 --> 34:09.000]  And if it's not the search engine, and they bury us 20 pages down,
[34:09.000 --> 34:12.000]  they don't find it. That's why you're the emissaries.
[34:12.000 --> 34:17.000]  You're the ambassadors. You are the missionaries of truth
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.000]  that send people a lot of feeds from infowars.com,
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  forward slash show, or band.video.
[34:22.000 --> 34:26.000]  Oh, but those are banned on most platforms, so you just send them
[34:26.000 --> 34:32.000]  futurenews.news and say, here is the verboten site
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  that no one dared name.
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.000]  And we can really use the Streisand effect against them.
[34:38.000 --> 34:44.000]  All right, let me get into this right now, because it's just so huge.
[34:44.000 --> 34:48.000]  And it's what's happening up in Canada that's now inspired people
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.000]  in the U.S. and all over the world, all over Europe,
[34:51.000 --> 34:54.000]  all over the U.K., all over Australia and New Zealand.
[34:54.000 --> 35:01.000]  Truckers and peaceful people are going to their major cities
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  and their capitals, and they're just encamping,
[35:03.000 --> 35:05.000]  and they're honking their horns and saying,
[35:05.000 --> 35:08.000]  we won't be forcibly injected to have our jobs or to drive a truck.
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  And we're sick of the lockdowns. We're sick of the tyranny.
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.000]  And I know one of my producers warned us this weeks ago,
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  and now it's happening.
[35:17.000 --> 35:21.000]  They're saying that there's auto part problems in Detroit
[35:21.000 --> 35:23.000]  because of the truckers.
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  And they're saying that there's not enough food on the shelves
[35:25.000 --> 35:29.000]  at your grocery stores because of the truckers.
[35:29.000 --> 35:34.000]  And yeah, they probably contribute 5% to what's happening, maybe,
[35:34.000 --> 35:40.000]  in those areas, but not even 1% in the aggregate over a whole country.
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  But what are they supposed to do? We're all being put under siege.
[35:43.000 --> 35:44.000]  We're all being told we're not essential.
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  We're all being told we're worthless.
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  We're all being told that they will pick and choose
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  who is allowed to go out and do what.
[35:50.000 --> 35:53.000]  And people start saying, no, peacefully.
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  We have a right under the Declaration of Independence
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  to get violent with these people at this point.
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  I think that's a bad move, and we shouldn't do it
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  because we're winning politically.
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  But countless videos of them slamming old people to the ground
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  that are caught out honking their horns.
[36:06.000 --> 36:12.000]  This is the stuff that will bring down these tyrants forever.
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  So I want to play for you a clip of one of the city council women,
[36:16.000 --> 36:17.000]  and they're just countless.
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  This is not just a lone person saying this.
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.000]  U.S. media saying it, Canadian media saying it.
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  The same Ottawa city councilor who called for their GoFundMe to be seized,
[36:27.000 --> 36:30.000]  and it was 11 million from the truckers, GoFundMe said,
[36:30.000 --> 36:31.000]  we're going to give it to Liberals.
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  People had a backlash.
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  They said, OK, we won't, but they still kept the money.
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  I mean, what a criminal group.
[36:37.000 --> 36:41.000]  This woman, councilor who called Canadian truckers terrorists,
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.000]  doubles down and calls them traitors.
[36:45.000 --> 36:46.000]  They're guilty of treason.
[36:46.000 --> 36:51.000]  No, you people following the Great Reset and the Pfizer corporate takeover
[36:51.000 --> 36:54.000]  and the post-industrial world and training us all were on lockdown
[36:54.000 --> 36:57.000]  and training us that we're presidents and you're the jail guard.
[36:57.000 --> 37:00.000]  You are the clear and present danger.
[37:00.000 --> 37:01.000]  You are the monster.
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  You are the problem.
[37:03.000 --> 37:04.000]  Here she is.
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  We all need to work together.
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.000]  This is not something this country has ever seen before.
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.000]  I understand Mark Carney referred to it as sedition today.
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  I think that's exactly what it is.
[37:16.000 --> 37:17.000]  This is treason.
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  This is way bigger.
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.000]  This is a group of well-polished professional people
[37:23.000 --> 37:27.000]  that are trying to overthrow the government,
[37:27.000 --> 37:30.000]  the democratically elected government of this country.
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.000]  This is not a target on the city of Ottawa.
[37:34.000 --> 37:35.000]  It's much bigger than that.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  It's really an insurrection.
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  It's an attack on our democracy.
[37:39.000 --> 37:42.000]  It's an attack on our federal government.
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  It has a lot of international elements to it.
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  The money is flowing from the U.S.
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  This is right out of the Trump playbook.
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.000]  Everything she says is inversion and projection.
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  There's a worldwide Great Reset operation lockstep.
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  UN, Debo Scroop,
[38:01.000 --> 38:04.000]  Bilderberg operation where they brag they're running it
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  to shut us down and bankrupt us
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  to put us on a universal basic income,
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  make so many people homeless,
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  they're going to nationalize all housing
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  like the CDC tried last year
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.000]  and make you put homeless people in your house.
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.000]  The CDC announced new plans today on it.
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  San Francisco announced new plans.
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  I have the article right here.
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  We'll cover it next segment.
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.000]  But these people are at war with our infrastructure,
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  at war with our economy,
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.000]  clout and piven to bankrupt us to make us come into their control.
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  Klaus Schwab writes books bragging about it,
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.000]  and he goes on TV and says it.
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.000]  They are totally taking thousands of years of war
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.000]  and in struggle to get basic freedom submitted and protected,
[38:48.000 --> 38:54.000]  and they're washing it away.
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  That's why everything they do is designed
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.000]  to bring down the civilization and bring down the society.
[38:59.000 --> 39:02.000]  I love this meme that's been going around.
[39:02.000 --> 39:06.000]  Libs in December of 2021 shows a guy looking at his computer screen.
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  He says, make life as difficult as possible for the unvaccinated.
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  Don't let them work or go out in public.
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.000]  Make them feel pain. Those are all real quotes.
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  By mainstream TV, corporate people,
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  big heads of companies want to make you take their product.
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  A company's going to lock you up if you don't take their product.
[39:22.000 --> 39:25.000]  Libs in 2022 crying red eyes.
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.000]  Why won't they stop honking?
[39:29.000 --> 39:34.000]  We just want to put a poison into their body.
[39:34.000 --> 39:37.000]  Why don't they like it?
[39:37.000 --> 39:40.000]  Blockade at key U.S.-Canadian border highway
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  could paralyze Detroit auto industry.
[39:42.000 --> 39:43.000]  Well, you know what?
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  They're already ship most set out of the country,
[39:45.000 --> 39:46.000]  and so they put us under siege.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  We got to put the globalists under siege,
[39:48.000 --> 39:49.000]  show them who's got the power.
[39:49.000 --> 39:50.000]  They started the war.
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.000]  We're just peacefully showing we got the power.
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.000]  Show gas lights Canadians in speech condemning trucker convoy,
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  saying they're criminals and terrorists.
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.000]  He gets booed the whole time,
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.000]  and it just goes on and on from there.
[40:04.000 --> 40:12.000]  I've got a progressive supercut of smash the workers revolt,
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  and we've got suddenly, oh, CNN doctor,
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  former head of Planned Parenthood,
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  a lady that says, you know,
[40:19.000 --> 40:20.000]  keep people in their houses.
[40:20.000 --> 40:21.000]  They don't take the shots.
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  We're masked.
[40:23.000 --> 40:26.000]  Well, now Mrs. Baby Hitler, CNN doctor,
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  the science has changed, so lift cover restrictions.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  Now masks don't work.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  Ah!
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.000]  Clown Olympic Canadian hockey team wears mask for entire game.
[40:37.000 --> 40:40.000]  Of course, it's the big Stockholm syndrome Canada
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  that's finally waking up.
[40:42.000 --> 40:45.000]  I mean, that is all a Milgram experiment.
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  CNN flip script on mask again,
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  says mass mandates can end because science has changed.
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  Science is whatever they say, folks.
[40:51.000 --> 40:55.000]  High profile Democrat apologizes for maskless school photo.
[40:55.000 --> 40:56.000]  What a cult.
[40:56.000 --> 40:57.000]  What a cult.
[40:57.000 --> 40:58.000]  It's all coming up.
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  I got so much more next segment, ladies and gentlemen,
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  but this is just insane.
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  They bit off more than they can chew.
[41:04.000 --> 41:05.000]  They made their run at us.
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  They had these battle plans on the shelf,
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.000]  but the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  Separately, I'm not Joe Rogan.
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  I don't have hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank.
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  I'm running an independent network with our own servers,
[41:18.000 --> 41:19.000]  platforms, our own systems.
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  Joe's visited many times and said,
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  this is the model of the future if he gets censored
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  a couple of miles down the road.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  All I'm saying is we built this infrastructure.
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  There's other infrastructures as emergency backups
[41:29.000 --> 41:32.000]  that have been constructed that other folks have.
[41:32.000 --> 41:33.000]  We're busy people here.
[41:33.000 --> 41:34.000]  This is a war.
[41:34.000 --> 41:35.000]  We know how serious this is.
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  We need funds to prosecute this war,
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  and we have great productivity at the same time.
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.000]  So, X3 has been sold out for four months.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  It's all three good types of iodine,
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  the deep-growth crystal iodine, two other types,
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  to supercharge your immune system,
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  to turbocharge your libido, your stamina,
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  your energy, everything.
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  If you haven't experienced iodine, real iodine,
[41:54.000 --> 41:57.000]  not the bound crappy type, it takes a few weeks to kick in,
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  usually about 15 days, 16 days.
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  But once it does, you really feel it.
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  When you forget to take it, you feel it.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  So, X3 is in stock.
[42:05.000 --> 42:06.000]  X2 is sold out.
[42:06.000 --> 42:07.000]  X3, they're apples and oranges.
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  They're both excellent.
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.000]  It's 50% off at infoworshore.com.
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  If you haven't tried it, get it, experience it.
[42:13.000 --> 42:16.000]  You've never bought something at infoworshore.com.
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  I know most of you haven't that are listeners.
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  It's a small minority keeping us on air.
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  If the majority of you, or even a large minority,
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  would buy a t-shirt, buy a book, buy a film,
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  we could really stay on air and not be in so much issues constantly.
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  But I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[42:32.000 --> 42:37.000]  So, infoworshore.com, or triple-eight, two-five-three,
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.000]  three-one, three-nine, triple-eight, two-five-three,

[42:49.000 --> 42:52.000]  on the highest quality storeable food ready to ship right now.

[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  Prepare with Alex.com.
[42:58.000 --> 43:00.000]  Sold out for months.
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  X3 is now back in stock.
[43:02.000 --> 43:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game-changing,
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  our products are game-changing,
[43:07.000 --> 43:10.000]  and so many people are deficient in iodide.
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  It's not the soil anymore.
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  Most of the ocean is contaminated,
[43:14.000 --> 43:17.000]  but when you get high-quality triiodine,
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.000]  all three of the healthy types together,
[43:19.000 --> 43:23.000]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido,
[43:23.000 --> 43:25.000]  but most importantly, your immune system.
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.000]  So, X3, the only triiodine on the market,
[43:29.000 --> 43:32.000]  highest grade, is now exclusively available again.
[43:32.000 --> 43:35.000]  Get 50% off at infoworshore.com.
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine,
[43:37.000 --> 43:40.000]  and what it does for your body takes about two weeks to get on average,
[43:40.000 --> 43:43.000]  you really need to experience X3.
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it,

[44:08.000 --> 44:09.000]  it changes the world.
[44:09.000 --> 44:12.000]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[44:12.000 --> 44:13.000]  They know you're angry.
[44:13.000 --> 44:15.000]  And now to get around big tech,
[44:15.000 --> 44:19.000]  it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  The XG does wonders.
[45:28.000 --> 45:29.000]  They recommend it to everybody.
[45:29.000 --> 45:30.000]  You're on the fence about it.
[45:30.000 --> 45:31.000]  Get off the fence.
[45:31.000 --> 45:32.000]  Get the product.
[45:32.000 --> 45:33.000]  Support the Info Wars.
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air.
[45:35.000 --> 45:36.000]  Thanks for rolling. Go ahead.
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[45:38.000 --> 45:39.000]  Honored talk to you.
[45:39.000 --> 45:40.000]  Awesome.
[45:40.000 --> 45:44.000]  So, personally, I wanted to do was to say I love the products.
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  Alpha Power, even at 29, if you ask my better half, she loves it.
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[45:52.000 --> 45:54.000]  It only works. It's not a joke.
[45:54.000 --> 46:23.000]  Absolutely.
[46:24.000 --> 46:27.000]  So, next up, we have the chemicals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[46:27.000 --> 46:32.000]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[46:32.000 --> 46:38.000]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[46:38.000 --> 46:43.000]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition,
[46:43.000 --> 46:46.000]  immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[46:46.000 --> 46:53.000]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[46:53.000 --> 47:00.000]  So, next time you visit, be sure to check it out at m4store.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[47:00.000 --> 47:24.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:24.000 --> 47:32.000]  You say that you wanna go to a land that's far away.
[47:32.000 --> 47:41.000]  How are we supposed to get there with the way that we're living today?
[47:41.000 --> 47:54.000]  You talk lots about God. Freedom comes from the call, but that's not what this bitch wants.
[47:54.000 --> 47:57.000]  Not what I want at all.
[47:57.000 --> 48:01.000]  I want freedom. I want justice.
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.000]  And I want a connection to God and eternity.
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.000]  And I want to be separated from the devil.
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  I want to be separated from Hollywood.
[48:11.000 --> 48:20.000]  I want to be separated from the devos group, for eternity.
[48:20.000 --> 48:27.000]  It's always the most unlikely of places, hardworking, sweet, good Canadians, great people.
[48:27.000 --> 48:37.000]  They're just like Midwesterners, and they're sick of getting pushed around.
[48:37.000 --> 48:43.000]  And the system did everything it could to try to silence them and demonize them, but nobody's buying it.
[48:43.000 --> 48:49.000]  Also, if you look at even the major newspapers up there, they have to admit,
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  okay, they called them white supremacists, this is a very diverse group of people,
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.000]  and that's what really scares the hell out of them.
[48:56.000 --> 49:01.000]  But here is the dead corporate media, the zombie media, because they're still the defense contractors
[49:01.000 --> 49:08.000]  and the big banks in the New World Order, keep them propped up like Frankenstein with their money,
[49:08.000 --> 49:15.000]  with their lightning bolts of billions in funding.
[49:15.000 --> 49:18.000]  And there they are, demonizing the truckers.
[49:18.000 --> 49:23.000]  You just heard the city council saying they're terrorists, they're traders, they're engaged in treason,
[49:23.000 --> 49:30.000]  they're seditionists, they need to be put in prison.
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  And then everything they say the truckers have done, they've done.
[49:32.000 --> 49:39.000]  You know, if the truckers protest everywhere and there's not some food or medicine that makes it in,
[49:39.000 --> 49:44.000]  that's like the pain of having a rotten tooth injected with novocaine.
[49:44.000 --> 49:48.000]  There's a little pain before you fix the tooth.
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.000]  The infection and the disease is the New World Order.
[49:51.000 --> 49:56.000]  And now the truckers are the dentist going in there to fix the tooth.
[49:56.000 --> 50:01.000]  And so, yeah, there may be some pain in this, but people saying, oh my God, if they take action,
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  they'll blame us and say we caused the shutdown and we caused the collapse.
[50:05.000 --> 50:11.000]  Well, if everybody's dumb enough after two years of being under siege and 40 plus million people starving to death
[50:11.000 --> 50:19.000]  in the third world caused by the lockdowns, not by the virus, to then believe that the truckers are the villains,
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.000]  bringing the globalists to a standstill and saying we don't want your policies,
[50:23.000 --> 50:28.000]  well, then we don't deserve freedom and we're that stupid.
[50:28.000 --> 50:34.000]  Detroit announced that they're shutting down eight of their factories a month ago this week.
[50:34.000 --> 50:42.000]  They said in a month, we're going to shut down eight plants in Michigan because we can't get the chips, the chips.
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.000]  And that's caused because of the lockdowns in Asia and the COVID hysteria.
[50:46.000 --> 50:55.000]  It was all over the news, but now the media's, oh, the plants are shutting down because the truckers.
[50:55.000 --> 51:01.000]  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah, right.
[51:01.000 --> 51:06.000]  So if we believe that, we deserve what happens to us.
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  And let me just say this before we play this compilation.
[51:08.000 --> 51:14.000]  Well, now go ahead and play the MSM, demonize the trucker compilation, their war on the working class,
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.000]  progressive smash the workers revolt. Here it is.
[51:17.000 --> 51:20.000]  Sedition, insurrection, a threat to democracy.
[51:20.000 --> 51:23.000]  This city is under siege. They are now calling it an occupation.
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  An alarming situation there in Ottawa.
[51:25.000 --> 51:30.000]  The police chief is calling it a nationwide insurrection driven by madness.
[51:30.000 --> 51:34.000]  This is kind of our insurrection by air horn moment.
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  I think it's part of the globalization of Trumpism.
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  Canadians know where I stand.
[51:38.000 --> 51:41.000]  There hasn't been as much violence as some had perhaps projected,
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  but that does not necessarily mean that it has been peaceful.
[51:43.000 --> 51:47.000]  Reports of severe vandalism and criminal behavior.
[51:47.000 --> 51:50.000]  Streets are clogged. The honking is incessant and deafening.
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.000]  This pandemic has sucked for all Canadians.
[51:53.000 --> 51:58.000]  Residents that I have spoken to who say they feel terrorized, intimidated.
[51:58.000 --> 52:01.000]  Residents say they feel like hostages.
[52:01.000 --> 52:04.000]  Residents in that area say that they are being held hostage,
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  that this freedom has essentially, freedom convoy, as they call it,
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.000]  has essentially imposed a lockdown on them.
[52:10.000 --> 52:13.000]  Some protesters harassed a soup kitchen.
[52:13.000 --> 52:17.000]  These anti-vaxxers actually took food from the mouths of the homeless.
[52:17.000 --> 52:18.000]  Hungry, yeah.
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  Because they were, they're so put upon.
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  There have not been any violent outbursts.
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  By the way, stop it for a minute.
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  Back it up a few seconds, please.
[52:26.000 --> 52:30.000]  Can Rob do or Darren McBreen or somebody have a hard working crook?
[52:30.000 --> 52:33.000]  Because I don't want to spend a lot of time on this, but I want to air it today.
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  Can someone take this three minute video?
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  We're going to finish the last minute here in a second.
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  And just everything they say put the truth.
[52:39.000 --> 52:42.000]  We've got cops beating people up, including black people.
[52:42.000 --> 52:45.000]  In the middle of the George Floyd thing, you've got white cops and black cops
[52:45.000 --> 52:48.000]  beating black people up in New York that don't wear a mask.
[52:48.000 --> 52:51.000]  I mean, beating them over the head with clubs.
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  We've got dogs biting people.
[52:53.000 --> 52:57.000]  We've got people being, their eyeballs knocked out in Germany.
[52:57.000 --> 53:02.000]  We've got old ladies being body slammed, their heads in the concrete in Australia.
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.000]  We have the numbers, 280 plus million on verge of starvation.
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  25 million starved to death.
[53:07.000 --> 53:10.000]  Another 20 something million, 40 plus million dead.
[53:10.000 --> 53:13.000]  All those headlines.
[53:13.000 --> 53:16.000]  Lockdowns cause tens of millions of starved to death.
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  Depression, suicide.
[53:18.000 --> 53:21.000]  Well, lockdowns cause global food shortage.
[53:21.000 --> 53:25.000]  Well, Mika Brzezinski, whose father was a war criminal,
[53:25.000 --> 53:28.000]  whose father called for exterminating most of the general population,
[53:28.000 --> 53:31.000]  Zbigniew Brzezinski, is up there caring about you.
[53:31.000 --> 53:34.000]  Well, they've been in a war against humanity.
[53:34.000 --> 53:37.000]  These peaceful truckers showing all the weak-minded people
[53:37.000 --> 53:41.000]  that the majority don't stand with this and letting them know they're not alone.
[53:41.000 --> 53:45.000]  Their leadership scares the tyrants.
[53:45.000 --> 53:48.000]  I'm gonna hit the key in a moment, but let's finish up with this.
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  Protesters harassed a soup kitchen.
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.000]  These anti-vaxxers actually took food from the mouths of the homeless.
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  Hungry, yeah.
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  Because they were so put upon.
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  There have not been any violent outbursts.
[54:00.000 --> 54:04.000]  The horns have been honking for 12 to 21 hours a night.
[54:04.000 --> 54:10.000]  The small fringe minority of people who are on their way to Ottawa
[54:10.000 --> 54:16.000]  or who are holding unacceptable views that they're expressing.
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.000]  Many of them are holding Confederate flags.
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  I heard there's QAnon supporters in the crowd.
[54:21.000 --> 54:24.000]  We've seen swastikas. We've seen the Confederate flag.
[54:24.000 --> 54:27.000]  We've seen flags with Justin Trudeau, our prime minister, in a noose.
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  Lots of Donald Trump flags as well. People chanting, let's go, Brandon.
[54:30.000 --> 54:33.000]  There's actually one of the rare times in history you're gonna see swastikas
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  and yellow stars at the same protest.
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  A few people showed...
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  By the way, back that up again in 10 seconds.
[54:40.000 --> 54:43.000]  I love the bouncy house in the background where they talk about swastikas.
[54:43.000 --> 54:48.000]  Folks, it's people showing Trudeau and swastikas saying he's a Nazi
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  and then people showing Jewish stars because you gotta get a shot
[54:51.000 --> 54:56.000]  to leave your house or have a job or be tracked if you're unvaccinated.
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.000]  I mean, just look at these yipping dogs of the mainstream media
[54:59.000 --> 55:02.000]  that are truly our enemies.
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.000]  They are truly the plague and the scourge.
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.000]  Got a big OAN reporter. There's a lot of great OAN reporters.
[55:08.000 --> 55:12.000]  My favorite OAN reporter is coming up, Pearson Sharp, next hour.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  I forgot to tell you that. I should have plugged that. I apologize.
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  He's amazing. That's coming up.
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  Let's finish up with the compilation.
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.000]  So, Brandon, there's actually one of the rare times in history
[55:21.000 --> 55:25.000]  you're gonna see swastikas and yellow stars at the same protest.
[55:25.000 --> 55:32.000]  A few people shouting and waving swastikas does not define who Canadians are.
[55:32.000 --> 55:37.000]  Ottawa is being besieged by a group of anti-do-anything-about-COVID-truckers
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  called the Freedom Convoy.
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  A so-called Freedom Convoy.
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  A so-called Freedom Convoy of truckers.
[55:43.000 --> 55:46.000]  It's a cult.
[55:46.000 --> 55:47.000]  Yes, it is.
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  We've heard it called a nationwide insurrection.
[55:49.000 --> 55:53.000]  The threat to democracy, an insurrection, sedition.
[55:53.000 --> 55:56.000]  This is a moment for responsible leaders to think carefully
[55:56.000 --> 56:02.000]  about where they stand and who they stand with.
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  Wow, ladies and gentlemen.
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.000]  Let me tell you what's really going on here, and I'll get into this more next hour.
[56:07.000 --> 56:11.000]  This is about a purge of the military and the police and the nurses and the doctors.
[56:11.000 --> 56:14.000]  Because they put out a shot they knew made people sick.
[56:14.000 --> 56:17.000]  I was asking, why'd they do that? They want an IV tied to the vaccine.
[56:17.000 --> 56:20.000]  Why don't they put a placebo out of your body on board?
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  No. They want you to get sick. They want you to get hurt.
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.000]  So all the smart people see that and go, oh, I'm not doing it.
[56:26.000 --> 56:30.000]  And then the corporations are ordered to fire them and society breaks down,
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.000]  which is clowered and pivoted again, which they admit is their plan.
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  And here it is.
[56:36.000 --> 56:46.000]  L.A. County supervisors vote to start firing 4,000 unvaccinated L.A. SD police officers.
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.000]  It's the same all over the world, but oh, guess who's given a waiver?
[56:49.000 --> 56:55.000]  If you join in on the riot police actions in Canada, the other cops have to take it in Canada.
[56:55.000 --> 57:00.000]  But if you sign up for riot police, you don't have to, both federal or local,
[57:00.000 --> 57:03.000]  you don't have to get the shot.
[57:03.000 --> 57:08.000]  Just like the FEMA emergency nurses replacing nurses that have been fired for not taking it,
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  they have an exemption. Look it up.
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.000]  We're going to go to break. Please don't forget these crazy times, supply chain breakdowns and everything.
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  You're nuts if you don't get storable food.
[57:16.000 --> 57:20.000]  And we've got the best company ready to ship to you at the best price you're going to find, even normally.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  But at 25% off, they haven't done this in four years.
[57:23.000 --> 57:27.000]  You cannot beat this deal that ends in 48 hours.
[57:27.000 --> 57:32.000]  So the last couple of days to take advantage of this at preparewithalix.com or infowarstore.com.
[57:32.000 --> 57:37.000]  But preparewithalix.com takes you right to the sub page at infowarstore.com
[57:37.000 --> 57:43.000]  where the full catalog of my Patriots applies high quality food is ready for you to order it and get it shipped to you.
[57:43.000 --> 57:48.000]  And it funds the info war a 360 win.
[57:48.000 --> 57:52.000]  Sold out for months. X3 is now back in stock.
[57:52.000 --> 57:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing.
[57:57.000 --> 58:00.000]  And so many people are deficient in iodine.
[58:00.000 --> 58:04.000]  It's not the soil anymore. Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[58:04.000 --> 58:09.000]  But when you get high quality tri iodine, all three of the healthy types together,
[58:09.000 --> 58:14.000]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly your immune system.
[58:14.000 --> 58:24.000]  So X3, the only tri iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[58:24.000 --> 58:30.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body, it takes about two weeks to get on average,
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  you really need to experience X3.
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[58:35.000 --> 58:41.000]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what does for your body.
[58:41.000 --> 58:45.000]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the info war, a true 360 win.
[58:45.000 --> 58:49.000]  So again, X3 back in stock, 50% off for a limited time.
[58:49.000 --> 58:53.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome.
[58:53.000 --> 58:54.000]  Hello, Alex.
[58:54.000 --> 58:55.000]  Yes, Malcolm.
[58:55.000 --> 58:59.000]  All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[58:59.000 --> 59:06.000]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMell Vitality and Brainforce Plus.
[59:06.000 --> 59:09.000]  Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable tank.
[59:09.000 --> 59:11.000]  SuperMell Vitality really, really works.
[59:11.000 --> 59:16.000]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[59:16.000 --> 59:20.000]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[59:20.000 --> 59:23.000]  It also worked quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[59:23.000 --> 59:25.000]  This is like a very fine wine.
[59:25.000 --> 59:27.000]  In fact, each batch is different.
[59:27.000 --> 59:30.000]  Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay.
[59:30.000 --> 59:33.000]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[59:33.000 --> 59:35.000]  That's just how it is. It's how it works.
[59:35.000 --> 59:37.000]  So it's always good.
[59:37.000 --> 59:39.000]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[59:39.000 --> 59:57.000]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  Blood on the streets.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  Wow.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  He's calling for terrorism.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  Arrest him.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  Blood on the streets.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  No, it's a figure of speech.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  Well, the left actually goes out and engages in blood on the streets and burns guns and kill people.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  Well, Kamala Harris bells them out because then that's reasonable to do.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  In the middle of a globalist communist takeover in this country.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  We've got an amazing Owen reporter who I really think is one of the most hardcore, truthful people out there joining us next segment.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  But I wanted to air this special report.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  The wheels are coming off the globalist tyranny.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  In the capital city of Ottawa, thousands of truckers and others have clogged the city streets for more than 10 days.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  Ottawa's mayor has now declared a state of emergency.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  I'm outlining three steps that I believe Doug Ford should be taking right now urgently.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  I think that we need to declare a provincial state of emergency.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  This is how serious the situation is.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  The wheels are absolutely coming off of everything they're doing.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  John Hopkins, which is a very diverse scientific group and is the preeminent planner for the Rockefeller Foundation of the COVID attacks.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  The mission of the Pandemic Emergency Board is to provide recommendations to deal with a major global challenges arising in response to an unfolding pandemic.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  The board is comprised of highly experienced leaders from business, public health and civil society.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  We could be looking at double the number of cases in one week and 16 times as many in a month if we are not able to stop the spread.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  There are pockets and significant pockets of the country where vaccines aren't happening because of those, you know, the anti-vaxxers or whatever you want to call them,
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  who have made significant headway in trying to convince parents they shouldn't vaccinate children.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  Do you get mad about it?
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  I push forward. I wouldn't say get angry, but I'm really impatient that we're not moving as fast as I'd like.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  This subsequent lies in fraud is now covering its ass by the very working group that was heavily involved with Bill Gates planning all this.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  Coming out in a 60-plus page report saying lockdowns are a fraud and have killed more people than the virus and that the economic destruction of it is going to starve hundreds of millions of people to death,
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  which is true. Reuters has come out and endorsed Iver Mecton and its incredible antiviral properties covering your little dirty asses, aren't you?
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  The head of Reuters on the board of Pfizer and his quarterback, the censorship, Jeff Zucker, the America-hating AT&T hatchet man for this country,
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  has now resigned and they always use the fall in the sword excuse of, oh, because he was having a relationship that was inappropriate with somebody that works there.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  The big crime is men and women having sex and, God forbid, any children come along.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  It wasn't lying, it wasn't infiltrating groups, it wasn't overseeing the persecution of millions of people that CNN would covertly and overtly target and have de-platformed.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  Jeff Zucker's departure was shocking to the staff of CNN, but the people who say we're lacking journalism, that we've become an all-talk channel,
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  that we've run off and we're all opinions all the time, that Jeff Zucker led us astray, those people aren't watching CNN.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  They're not watching CNN. They're watching complaints about CNN on other channels that don't know what they're talking about.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  Joe Rogan's irresponsible. He took horse-market medicine the other day.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  Now tell me, sir, and don't tell me anything other than this. Should there be a war?
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  Yes, there should be a war.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  Interview's done. I'd like to see you do that, Joe Rogan.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  Which sounds great, but not all opinions are created equal.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  The crime's not defunding the police. The crime's not opening up the violent people out of the prisons and having five-fold homicide and carjacking numbers explode in blue cities, a doubling nationwide on average.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  The wheels are coming off. The House of Cards is collapsing. The New World Order is in deep, deep, deep, deep trouble.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  They knew their system was going down. You better know these people aren't going to give up.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  And they're going to stage false flags and blame it on people. And they're going to go blow up and shoot up black churches.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  And they're going to start war with Russia. And they're going to try to gut our economy as fast as they can because they know they're going down and they want to take us down with them.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  And so many people are deficient in iodine. It's not the soil anymore. Most of the ocean is contaminated. But when you get high-quality tri-iodine, all three of the healthy types together, it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly, your immune system.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  So, X3, the only tri-iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off at mforeshore.com.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body takes about two weeks to get on average, you really need to experience X3.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it. But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the M4 war, a true 360 win. So again, X3, back in stock, 50% off.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  On the Infowars.com studio is Alex Jones.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  Our children die after being forced to take this same poisonous drug that's making big pharma companies like Pfizer and Moderna over $100 billion a year.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  Since the armed forces rolled out the vaccine in one year, cancer rates are up 300% among military members.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  But that's not all. Infertility is skyrocketing as well, up 500% in women, along with miscarriages, which are up another 300%.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  This is a pandemic of the ignorant, and it's killing our country.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  So for all you progressives and Democrats and radical leftists out there, do us all a favor, please, and go get vaccinated.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  In fact, don't stop there. Get double vaccinated and be sure to get all your boosters, all three or four of them.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  Why stop there? If more is better, get five, six, get 10 boosters.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  All the rest of us sane, freedom-loving Americans are counting on you to get your injections.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  The survival of our country depends on it.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  For One American News, I'm Pearson Sharpe.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  All right, folks, we're excited to have him on. I mean, every day when he does his analysis, it's amazing.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  That's just a small portion of it. You can find him on Twitter and on Getter at Pearson Sharpe.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  And we really appreciate him joining us today.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  We have a Syrian girl who actually worked for Pfizer as a major whistleblower coming on and joining us from Australia in the next hour as well.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  Pearson, great to have you. We're all huge fans of you here.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  Alex, thank you very much. It is really an honor to be on here.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  You're one of the few truth tellers in our country right now, and it's a real pleasure to speak with you.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  Well, it's a pleasure to have you here, brother.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  What is it like being at OAN, seeing it explode in popularity, seeing the sensors come after it?
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  Out of all the great people there, and I mean, I watch it hours a day.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  We have it on here at the office, all over the building.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  We don't have Fox on it anymore, other than Tucker Carlson, occasionally.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  What is it like to see your platform explode, people hungry for the truth?
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  And what is it like to, I think, be the most hardcore person over at OAN?
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  Well, it's very interesting because, I mean, it is exploding.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  And I'm sure, as you know, like you've experienced yourself, when you start telling the truth,
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  when you start presenting evidence and facts and information that goes against the narrative,
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  against what Big Pharma and Washington are putting out, they come down on you like a ton of bricks.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  At OAN, we have tons of support.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  The viewer emails that we get just pour in over the country.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  We even get emails from overseas, from Mexico, from Australia, from New Zealand,
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  all these other places where they're trying to clamp down on their freedoms as well.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  We get viewer emails from everywhere, people giving us their support.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  But when you turn on the mainstream media, or if you Google search OAN,
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  that is not the impression that you would get.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  It would appear that we are the most extreme right-wing Nazi propaganda that ever existed since Goibles.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  And that's the message they're trying to promote.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  So we're sitting here and we're just giving the truth.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  We're finding these facts. We're presenting it.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  We're talking to real-life doctors. We're going to their hospitals.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  We're talking to the patients who survived this pandemic thanks to their care, not the vaccine,
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  not avoiding early treatment, doing all the things they're supposed to do.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  And we are being presented as, you know, the worst misinformation possible
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  when nothing could be further from the truth.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  So it's been fascinating to watch all this happen.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  It's like living in two realities, one where the truth exists and you're just reporting it,
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  and another this twisted world where they're distorting the information
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  and trying to present this false narrative and make that the truth instead.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  It's absolutely fascinating.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  Well, what's amazing is I've watched OAN since it started many years ago,
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  and always did a great job, but just get bigger and stronger and more reporters.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  And if I had any criticism, it is that you guys show both sides,
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  when sometimes we know the other side has already been proven to be liars.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  They're frauds, but you guys will still show what they have to say.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  But I guess in the aggregate, you know, I guess that's the fairest thing to do.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  But I just love the fact when I watch your reports, because I've already researched the stuff.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  I know you're not lying about it.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  You just hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer one point after the other.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  It's just devastating.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  Well, you have to.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  You get to a point where I'm absolutely fed up with watching the destruction of my country.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  You are pushed into a corner, and you've tried to be fair,
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  and you've tried to give the benefit of the doubts to the other side,
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  and you've tried to let everybody have their say, but enough is enough.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  And there's just a point where you have to push back and say, we've had it.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  And this is how it is.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  And we're not going to let you get away with this anymore,
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  because you are literally destroying our country.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  I just had a daughter last month, my first child.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  And I'm very afraid for the world that she's going to be growing up in.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  And so when I'm doing these reports, when I'm investigating this stuff,
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  that's part of what's on my mind is thinking about, I'm trying to make this a safer place for my child.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  And I know there's a lot of other Americans out there who have kids who are scared about this as well.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  And I've never worn a mask throughout this.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  Having researched it and looked into it before, it doesn't work the way they say it does.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  That's not what masks are for.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  And so at this point, it's a sign of submission.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  And thinking about it, looking ahead, my daughter will never wear a mask.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  I don't want her to grow up in a country where that's what's required.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  We will never show that sign of submission to this authority, this false authority that you're trying to impose on us.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  And it's the same with the vaccines.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  We're not going to do the COVID vaccines on her because they don't work.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  They don't work, Alex.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  You know this.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  We all know this.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  But we've got to put that out there and let people know what's happening.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  Otherwise, it's going to be imposed.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  This is going to be COVID-1984.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  And we've got to stop that.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  You're absolutely right.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  And of course, you have the same views as I do on this crazy world.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  You've written a book, The Sovereign, available on Amazon.com.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  You're working on the next three books in the series and plotting your escape with your family from the big city to a little cabin in the woods.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  Brother, that is exactly where we all want to go away from the New World Order.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  I want to get into COVID and the lies and what's coming out and where you see things going and the big stories you're working on when we come back.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  But first off, for Pearson Sharpe at OAN, gut level, why do you think it is the people that worship power in Hollywood or worship power in D.C. or New York?
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  They think we're like them.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  They think we're trying to overthrow them to get their positions of power.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  When they don't understand, we just want to away from them.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  We're only involved in politics to get them off our backs.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  We want to be left alone.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  That is the biggest thing.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  I think people like you, people like me, most Americans, we just want to be left alone.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  Do whatever crazy stuff you want to do.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  That's fine.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  Leave us the hell alone.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  My wife and I have been talking.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  We're stuck in San Diego right now, the Commiforna, and we'd love to get to a freer state.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  But in the meantime, we've got to fight back.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  These people, it is a power trip for them.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  It doesn't matter that we want to be left alone.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  They can't stand that.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  The government, I think all government, hate independent self-sufficient citizens because they can't control them.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  One of my biggest passions and interests is what's happening in Tibet.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  I don't know why I've just been always fascinated by Tibet and the culture and the history.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  Watching what China has done to them, you see that reflected, starting to be reflected here in the United States.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  That's terrifying because there are nomads in Tibet that just wandered the plains.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  They have for thousands of years and they hurt nobody.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  They're out mining their business, just living their nomadic lifestyle.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  The Chinese goon squads go out and round them up from the countryside and force them to live in poverty in the cities.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  I think that's what the goal is here.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  They're trying to put all of us into these cities.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  They're trying to put all of us where they can keep an eye on us.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  They're trying to just clamp down on all of our freedoms and it's never been about leaving us alone.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  That's right.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  It's all about the board because they are farmers, big government, big corporations, farmers,
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  and so they can't expand their money or power unless we submit to them.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  It has a name.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  It's called Slavery.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  We're going to come back and go wherever Pearson Sharp wants to go.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  In fact, he's got another one of those badass monologues that's right up there with Tucker Carlson.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  We'll let him just take the show over here today.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, knockout, with down and out,
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower,
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees,
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep,
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  because you will be down and out.
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:19:20.000]  Selling it out now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up?
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more,
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  for a pound, and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  We had one.
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  You wouldn't believe it.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  Anyway, so it's InfoWarsStore.com, and that's how we fund this operation.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  And if you don't find us and don't want to stare, that's fine.
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  You should ask the Holy Spirit.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  Then you get the answer to everything you know, even before you die.
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  But you didn't.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  Welcome to the InfoWars.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  Alright, one of the most truthful, hardcore interviewers,
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  analyst, but his opening monologues like Tucker Carlson does is right up there at the top.
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  Pearson Sharp is here.
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  Pearson, you're an investigative journalist for One American News,
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  but you're a really interesting fellow.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  We want to know about you.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  You cover international conflicts and does on the ground reporting around the world
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  from migration crisis to Sweden to the war in Syria,
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  and you're an author and a father and a husband.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  Spend a few minutes on you to introduce yourself, the audience,
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  because you never talk about yourself on air.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  And then we want to drill into the wheels coming off with the whole COVID narrative,
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  and suddenly, oh, you don't need masks, you don't need shots.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  I think they really realize they woke up the sleeping giant and pissed us off
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  and want us to go back to sleep.
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  But first, tell us a little bit about yourself.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  I hope they realize that.
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  I hope it's not too late.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  So for me, I was raised in Ohio, grew up in Ohio, a little country kid,
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  and I came to the big city after a few years, traveled around the world.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  I lived in China for a year, which probably shaped a lot of my world views
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  more than just about anything.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  And I can talk about that later, but it's definitely been one of the biggest
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  warning signs to me as an American having experienced what is happening over there.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  Personally, I'm not a hardcore news junkie.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  I come to work and I'm passionate about this, but when I go home,
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  I hang out with my wife and we watch old Star Trek reruns next generation,
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  and we're both kind of nerds.
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  Yeah, but we both feel passionate about this,
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  and I think it's important that people do this, that people talk about what's happening,
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  because if we don't, we're going to lose it.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  One of the biggest events in my life as a journalist, I think, was when I went to Syria,
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  and the situation over there, I think, has a lot of ramifications
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  and implications for what we're seeing today in Russia and in Ukraine,
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  and pretty much anywhere in the world the US is involved.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  Talking about proxy wars.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  Talking about proxy wars, but also talking about media misinformation.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  And what I mean by that is, when I went to Syria,
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  I was actually talking to the people who lived there,
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  talking to the residents, talking to the citizens in the city where they say the gas attack happened.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  And everybody I talked to, everybody I talked to said it didn't happen.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  And I was there with a couple of other news agencies.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  Reuters was the one that comes to my mind, and there was a woman there from Reuters,
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  and she talked to the exact same people that I talked to.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  I watched her, because we went around in the alleged bomb zone, the crime area,
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  and when we got back to our trucks, you know, she had a van there
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  where she was broadcasting back to Reuters, and I could hear her dictating.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  And after talking to the same people that I talked to who said nothing happened,
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  she went on to give this about five-minute explanation to her producer or whoever
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  about how the citizens there were just terrified, and the gas had been overwhelming,
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  and that, you know, Assad was going to kill them,
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  and it was just, it was a breathtaking spectacle to see how these people were surviving
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  this terrible tragedy of what he had done to them.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  I'm just, my mind was blown.
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  How is this happening?
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  And you realize that they're not reporting the news.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  I mean, we all know that, but then when you actually see it happening right in front of you,
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  it's astonishing the levels that they will go to to try and conceal and cover up
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  and unveil the truth.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  And by the way, why don't you recap that?
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  Because I remember several times they said that Assad launched nerve gas,
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  and the jihadis couldn't help themselves.
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  They wanted the money they'd get from showing they'd launched it.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  So they were putting videos out, bragging they'd launched it.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  And then the blue helmets and the white helmets and the rest of them got caught staging events.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  And the little kids that didn't really die went on TV.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  These were confirmed false flags.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  But you were there behind the curtain when it was going on before it even got pulled back.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  Right. And yeah, those kids said that they were offered candy to, you know, go on and talk about this.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  And I talked to the doctors in the hospitals who were down there and they said,
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  yeah, we didn't see anything.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  It was just a normal day.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  No issues.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  People came in.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  The white helmets and the terrorists rushed in and said that they were finding this, you know, gas attack
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  and people were hurt, but they didn't see any injuries.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  And these are the doctors that I was talking to.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  So yeah, it was a false flag.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  And these terrorists were putting that message out there so that,
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  not necessarily so that they could get money, although they were getting, I think,
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  about $500 million.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  Rand Paul even talked about that from the CIA every year in weapons and arms and all that kind of stuff.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  But they were doing it to escape the country because Assad had them cornered.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  And so I feel like that's, you know, I'm not in Ukraine.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  I'm not in Russia right now.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  But after having seen that, you start to see telltale signs that were over there meddling again.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  That's what we do.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  We have bases all over that area.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  We have bases in the Black Sea.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  We have ships.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  We have weapons and vehicles and everything over there.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  And Russia is the antagonist somehow.
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  So, I mean, if you flipped it around, if Russia had bases in Mexico and Tijuana,
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  and they had ships patrolling Baja California and, you know, the Gulf of Mexico,
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  that would be World War III.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  You know, we would attack them immediately.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  But when it's us doing it, you know, they're the aggressor.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  And that seems to be the narrative that the U.S. pushes these days.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  The war hawks on both sides just go along with it.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  Well, absolutely.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  And when anybody comes out and says, we don't want war with Russia,
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  again, you get called a Russian agent.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  But then meanwhile, it's actually the Democrats that have been paid off of the Russians in many cases.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  So everything they accuse us of is the opposite.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  Almost 80 percent of Americans, as you know, in national polls,
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  don't want a war with Russia or an escalation in conflict.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  Are they all on the Russian payroll?
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  No, they're sick of this garbage.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  They absolutely are sick of this garbage.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  My biggest concern is, you know, with them doing this is,
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  it does seem like it's leading up to,
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  Biden has just an absolute crisis on his hands here with everything going on,
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  and is just...
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  That was my next question for you after the break.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  How does Biden, how do the globalists get out of this?
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  Because they stole the election.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  They put in a geriatric corpse.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  He's got probably a 30 percent approval rating.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  We know they've tried to prop him up.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  They claim 38 percent.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  What are they going to do?
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  Much less than that.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  Well, I think we're seeing what they're going to do.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  They've already got a blueprint that it worked great last time.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  You unleash a virus and then you can control the elections.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  They've got hammer and scorecard.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  We know that from back in the day.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  That worked pretty well for them.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  So I think right now what we're seeing with Russia is probably more to do with
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  Biden's numbers than anything else.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  And that's, I mean...
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  I agree.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  I think October surprise is trying to start a war with Russia, which is insane.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  And they've done it before and it always seems to work.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  And a lot of us know that it's bogus,
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  but it doesn't seem to make a difference.
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  War is good for ratings.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  We've seen that throughout U.S. history.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  You know, whenever you're falling in the polls, just unleash a war.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  Work for Bush.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  You did a great job with that.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  But this is Russia.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  This is in Iraq.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  So imagine we'll all have really big ratings when the first nukes go off in Europe
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  and then we'll have 10 minutes of tens of millions tuning in before we die.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  That's called suicide...
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  Suicide journalism.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  I mean, it's just dumb.
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  Well, it is, but they're not thinking that far ahead.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  And they don't...
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  We know, Alex, we know at this point,
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  and they've demonstrated it.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  There are so many examples.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  They do not care about us.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  They do not care what happens to us.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  The less of us, the better.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  I mean, Bill Gates has come out and said that.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  Exactly. That's what a famous Chinese communist leader said is,
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  I don't care if you kill 50 million Chinese, we've got too many.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  We'll be right back with Pearson Sharpe. Stay with us.
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  Thanks for watching.
[1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:55.000]  And it funds the M4 war. A true 360 win.
[1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  So again, X3 back in stock.
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:29:59.000]  50% off our limited time.
[1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:01.000]  Sold out for months.
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:03.000]  X3 is now back in stock.
[1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing,
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  our products are game changing.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  And so many people are deficient in iodine.
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  It's not the soil anymore.
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:15.000]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  But when you get high quality triiodine,
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:20.000]  all three of the healthy types together,
[1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido,
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  but most importantly, your immune system.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:29.000]  So, X3, the only triiodine on the market,
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  highest grade, is now exclusively available again
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  at 50% off at m4warstore.com.
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine,
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:41.000]  and what it does for your body, it takes about two weeks to get on average,
[1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  you really need to experience X3.
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it,
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:47.000]  I know you're going to be reordering it.
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:49.000]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product,
[1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  you need it because it's amazing what does for your body.
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:54.000]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen,
[1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  and it funds the m4war, a true 360 win.
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  So again, X3, back at stock, 50% off at limited time.
[1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:04.000]  This is a great sponsor.
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:06.000]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there
[1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  on a high quality, high rated satellite phone
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:11.000]  so you can't be tracked, you can't be traced,
[1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:14.000]  and it'll work anywhere in the world where you can see the sky.
[1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  You can also buy cheap antennas and things for your car in your house
[1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:20.000]  and also from the site infowarsphone.com.
[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  That's just a site that takes you to these folks.
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  They supply the board for everybody with their systems as well.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:28.000]  They're amazing folks, and you get a free phone, a $600 to $50 value,

[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:37.000]  These aren't, and the calls are free when folks call you.
[1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes.
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  So the calls you were free were like a regular cell phone,
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:46.000]  you're not being tracked or traced,
[1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  you keep one on my car, I've given it to my parents as gifts,
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:51.000]  way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work.
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-41955
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:59.000]  then 20 and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  Come to command here with an important message to humanity.
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:17.000]  so that you will be safe, but the injection is not ready.
[1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the cans.
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy,
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:45.000]  leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  You will then be my slave.
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of freedom from Oprah,
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:55.000]  it will remove your immune system,
[1:32:55.000 --> 1:33:12.000]  so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:19.000]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country.
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:34.000]  Harping on wars, we fight and griping about the way things are to be.
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  And I don't mind them switching sides and standing up for things they believe in.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  The one they think, the very naked shell should be dissolved, they are enemies.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  And that's why the globalists tell you, you're a Nazi, you're a Russian agent,
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  you're all these preposterous things, because they're the ones that are the globalists,
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  they're the ones that are the outsiders, they are the people taking over,
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  they are the usurpers, and I want to talk about communist China and Pelosi
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  and all the NBA owners endorsing the Uyghur genocide and the rest of it
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  with our special guest here, Pearson Sharpe of OAN.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  And he's here with us right now, but I wanted to hit some of the really big news,
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  and before I hit the stories I want to get your take on,
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  what do you think the big takeaway right now on this worldwide biomedical tyranny is?
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  What do you think the biggest story is right now concerning all the huge developments?
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  Well, one thing, and it kind of leads into that,
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  you mentioned the globalists wanting to dissolve our country,
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  and that ties into the big biotech war that we're facing right now,
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  is from the Bible, Ephesians 612, I'm not sure if you're familiar with that.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  I am.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  But it says, for our struggle, for our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  The powers and principalities of the air.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  Read that again.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  What the Bible is saying is there's evil entities manipulating humans above this
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  and a fallen group on the planet that wants to lead us towards this.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  People say, well, that's 2,000 years ago. It's now being fulfilled.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  Read that Ephesians quote again, please.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  For our struggle is not against the flesh and blood,
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  but against the rulers, against the authorities,
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  against the powers of this dark world,
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  And that says it all. That says exactly what we're facing right now.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  Alien attack.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  And we see the globalists operating like they're not human,
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  like they just hate everything about humans, transhumanism. What's your view on that?
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  Transhumanism. I'm not super familiar with that concept, Alex.
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  Well, that's basically the globalists say we've got to give up our humanity
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  and that humans are failed. We've got to merge with machines.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  Well, I mean, that makes perfect sense.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  They want to destroy everything that's human about us,
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  and we see that in everything they're doing with the injections to dehumanizing us,
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  keeping us at home, not allowed to talk to people,
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  not allowed to see our family members in the hospitals or dying.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  They want to destroy everything in a road, everything that makes us human.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  They hate the nuclear family.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  I go home to my wife at night and we sit there with our daughter,
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  and you just, it sparks something inside of you.
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  You just feel this warmth and this happiness and this contentment,
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  and you know this is what it's about.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  Your family, God, and being together.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  This is what it's about, and it feels good.
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  And you know that that just drives them nuts.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  They hate that because everything they're doing is trying to destroy that feeling
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  and that togetherness and that closeness, that family unit.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  They've been trying to destroy it since the 50s.
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  This is an ongoing war against what makes us human,
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  and they're getting closer and closer to their end goal.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  But like you said before I came on, they're in panic mode right now
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  because we are pushing back and we're pushing back hard,
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  and I don't think they expected it to go this way for them.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  They thought it was going to be a little bit easier.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  The thing that scares me though, that worries me is we are pushing back,
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  but the American people, you know, we're supposed to be the cowboys,
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  we're supposed to be the rebels and the renegades and the revolutionaries,
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  but throughout the last two years, we have just shown a shocking tolerance
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  to this kind of oppression and this tyranny,
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  and we just go along with it and bend over and accept what they're saying,
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  and I didn't expect that.
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  I thought we were going to have more of a backbone and push back.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  Now, we're not like New Zealand, we're not like England, you know,
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  we haven't been pushed that far and I think the only reason that's happened
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  is because we have guns and they don't,
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  but they're doing everything they can to get rid of those as well.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  I totally agree with you.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  So why do you think they're suddenly claiming,
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  okay, we're going to back off the mask,
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  we're going to back off forced injection for now?
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  I think that's because they see that finally people see them and they've pushed too far,
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  they hope we go back to sleep.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  They do, they absolutely do.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  They have pushed too far, but I wonder what is going to be the sparking point?
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  What is going to be the Boston massacre of our generation?
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  What is going to be the Flintstone that sets this off?
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  And the other thing that worries me, and I'd like to get your take on this,
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  is when we do push back and we push back hard enough,
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  I'm concerned that whether it's Biden or Kamala or whoever it is,
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  someone in Washington is going to say,
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  look, this is too much for us to handle.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  Hey, China, you want to help us out here?
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  You're good at putting down riots and oppressing people.
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  Oh, that's why they've been getting used to.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  Oh, the UN's running our border.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  Oh, the UN's overseeing our police.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  So that's a great question.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  How are they going to try to continue to their control?
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  Because an abuser doesn't give up, they just double down.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  Pearson, I would say that it's going to be a cyber attack,
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  that they launch themselves, that they blame on a patriotic group
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  or somebody else or the Russians.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  I think blackouts is what they're going to do.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  If we really start winning and really start removing them peacefully,
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  they're going to turn the power off.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  Yeah, EMP is whatever it takes.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  So we can't fight back.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  And then there's going to be mass starvation.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  But back to my point, I'm legitimately concerned that it could be a very real possibility
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  that we have an initially soft invasion from China
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  where Washington rolls out the welcome mat
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  and we have Chinese Eastkeepers coming over and filling our streets
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  to a hard invasion where there is no rebellion against Washington anymore,
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  but we're just fighting an outright war against China on our own doorstep.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  Well, that's right.
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  And no one would believe that would happen.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  Do not fight the Chinese peacekeepers or your racist.
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  And that's basically it.
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  They're going to try to trick black folks and others to, quote,
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  join the Chai comms in the UN.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  It would be Chai comm, which already makes up two-thirds of the UN peacekeeping force.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  It'd be Chai comms under the UN helmet.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  But it would be majority Chinese troops.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  Yeah.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  One thing I like, I've been thinking about this and it worries me.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  I wanted to get your opinion on this too.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  Where we're at now, how bad things have gotten.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  Do you think that we can have, can we recover from where we are?
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  Can we have a peaceful recovery where we are?
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  Because everything I've seen, it looks like the democratic process has failed.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  Negotiations have failed.
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  And I hate to think that a revolution is the only answer,
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  but I don't see these people ever giving up power.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  I'll tell you why.
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  It's because the George Soros and the British royalty and the rest of them,
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  they feel insulated and protected.
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  They feel like the public doesn't know how they fund Bilderberg or Davos.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  They feel like when Prince Charles says we need a global military action against the humans to save the earth.
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  And we need more money than all the money in the earth to bring in the new Green Deal, which is depopulation.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  He thinks when he goes and speaks at a UN meeting, no one's paying attention to that.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  But instead of 1% knowing about it 20 years ago, maybe 20% know now.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  Well, 20% can wake up 40%, can wake up 60%.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  So it may take, let me show people a graph right here, just out of my mind.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  You know, let's say this is 1990, okay?
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  And 1% are awake.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  And then let's move to 2022.
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  So let's say 1% are awake here.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  And then it goes up and suddenly it's 20%.
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  In 2021, 2022, it's maybe 30%.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  This is what scares them because once awakenings hit, they go parabolic.
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  Okay, so it's exponential.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  So we're basically right here.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  They know that, okay, they got 25, 30% right now.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  What are we going to do?
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  And that's why they're starting wars and getting us ready because they want to try to shut that off no matter what.
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  And the question is, can we educate people enough to understand to let the globalists know you're not going to get away with this?
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  Just give in to the revolution, give in to the new Renaissance, that's the point right there.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  I think you're absolutely right.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  And one of the terrifying things you mentioned this, I think the other day on your show, we've got 55 federal agencies who are now tracking people who are objecting these vaccines.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  They're putting in a religious objections and stuff like that.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  They're tracking these people.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  The DHS has a list.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  They're tracking people.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  The Department of the Treasury actually will track and maintain information about religious beliefs.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  That's right, unprecedented.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  Pearson Sharp of OAN, stay there.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  We'll come right back and talk about this key issue.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  This product is more than twice the servings of our Brain Force Plus as well, so you know it's packed full of the good stuff.

[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  We know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see, but there is only two things to do.
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at M4store.com.
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  We must submit and turn our very bodies, our very productivity, our very genetics, our very future over to them.
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  They want control of procreation.
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  They want control of the relationships between men and women.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  They want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  All of us were formed and made in God's mind, in God's image, and given free will.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  To mistake all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special time so that you could make the right decision in free will and stand against evil.
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  And then, for eternity, win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.

[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  It even takes better than the last formula.

[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  And it helps funding InfoWare.
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  This is really the best bone broth out there.
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:47:12.000]  So get yours at m4store.com today, leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  I just went into the break room to get a cup of coffee and there was the great Pearson Sharp on OAN, knocking it out of the park.
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  The final segment with him, I really appreciate you joining us today, must watch Wednesday broadcast, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  Pfizer warned shareholders to brace for unfavorable clinical safety data.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  Meanwhile, the CDC has announced that it's set to release new guidance saying don't take shots too close.
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  Together they can cause blood clots or heart attacks, myocarditis and death.
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  Pearson Sharp, you got caught off by the break.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  You were getting into some really important areas concerning all this medical tyranny.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  What was that point you wanted to hit that I'm going to ask you about these new stories?
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  Well, we just found out a couple of days ago that there are 55 federal agencies, including five cabinet level agencies,
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  who are now tracking Americans and employees, specifically of them, the Treasury Department, even the military,
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  tracking employees who have objections to the vaccine, who apply for an exemption or something, who don't want to get it.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  They're tracking these people and you better believe they're watching them closely.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  They're basically, what this is, is curating a list of enemies of the state.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  And what's terrifying is that we've seen this before.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  All of this has happened before.
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  In 1930s Germany, IBM created a database of Jewish people in Europe, which really greatly facilitated the Nazi Germany government
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  going after the Jews in their country.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  And now I feel like that's what we're seeing here.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  They're going after red blooded Americans who are standing up for their country and don't want to be a part of this genocide.
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  They're tracking them and we know where this leads.
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  Well, that's right. This is all, if you had a list of like a hundred things that tyrants would do,
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  and like Hitler did 60 and Stalin did 50 and Mao did 75, they've done like a hundred.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  I mean, they're going down everything a tyrant would do and they're checking the box off.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  I mean, tracker chips and all the cars by law, just completely insane.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  What do you make of the new story that broke just last night?
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  It's on infowars.com. Zero Hedge has it.
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  Pfizer quietly adds language warning that unfavorable preclinical, clinical or safety data may impact business
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  off all those documents federal courts ordered them to release.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  That to me is a huge story.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  Well, it is a huge story and we know that they tried with the FDA to delay that first by 55 years, delay their safety data,
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  then by 75 years, they tried to prevent this information from getting out to the public almost the year 2100.
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  We'd be finding out what happened long after all the people involved were dead or couldn't be arrested anymore.
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  So they are terrified of what's going to get out and they're hoping that we don't figure it out in time
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  where they can just figure out a way to blame it on something else.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  I don't know if you saw, they said that actually all these side effects that we're experiencing from the vaccine,
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  it's all placebo. It's all in our head. It's not actually from the vaccine.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  We've just been reading right-wing conspiracy theories and now we're suffering myocarditis
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  because we've read those conspiracies.
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  Yeah, for those that don't know that the Daily Mail, the London Guardian, the Associated Press, they're all reporting
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  the heart attacks are exploding because of the fear of COVID and the lockdowns when no, the inserts on the shots say it causes it.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  Right, exactly. The FDA knows that they put warning labels on it, Moderna put warning labels on it.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  Pfizer has admitted it. We all know that this causes heart failures.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  We're seeing a 500% increase in deaths from athletes, from soccer players, just dropping dead on the field from one year ago.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  I mean, what kind of smooth brain inbred do you have to be to not see what's actually happening here?
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  And that goes back to them now suddenly saying, OK, we don't have to wear the mask. OK, no force inoculations.
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  But then they actually move forward with the same policy. So they tell us we're winning to make us go to sleep, but they're not stopping.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  It's crazy.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  They'll never back down. And that's what worries me is what we're going to have to do to get them to back down.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  I mentioned earlier I wanted to talk about China. I live there for a year.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  Yes, let's talk about China. In fact, I had that here, the Olympics and all the dystopic images of power plants.
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  And those looks like nuclear smokestacks behind people. And then the food they're feeding people is literally worse than Supermax prison stuff.
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  What's going on here?
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  Oh, my God. Yeah, it's China.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  Astonishingly, China is the end goal for the globalists.
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  They want everything to be like that where everyone is just totally controlled and cowed into submission.
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  When I was over there, I was a teacher at Shu Chang University, which is in central China, about 12 hours west of Beijing.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  And it was a town of about 4 million people, which is considered small over there.
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  And my students were really nice, but I have never met a more indoctrinated group of people in my life.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  And it was everybody. Everybody you would run into was just...
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  It's difficult to explain to someone in the west the difference in behavior between a Chinese national and an American.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  And this is a total cultural thing before anyone jumps to racism because you talk to people from Hong Kong and it's night and day.
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  They're like Americans. You talk to people from Taiwan. They're like Americans. They understand what freedom is.
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  This is three generations under communism and they're like Martians.
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  Yeah, they are. They absolutely are like Martians.
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  They are totally obedient. They don't question anything.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  And they have a concept over there called saving face, where you know the person you're talking to is lying.
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  They know you know that they're lying, but you both continue with it because you want to preserve face.
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  And that interaction happens in everything that you do.
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  People will... I was teaching my students and I saw one student cheating off another and I called him on it.
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  Like I'm watching him and he said, no, I'm not. I can see you doing it right there. No, I'm not.
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  So all they do is just gaslight and just go along.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  That's why they have so many disasters, so many plants melt down because no one will tell anybody they're wrong.
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  Exactly. Yep, it's endemic to their culture.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  And that I'm afraid is what's going to happen here. People are just going to buy what's being fed to them.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  My students all 100% believed that Taiwan was part of China.
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  There was no debate about it. You would get fired from the school if you even questioned that.
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  And that Tibet had always been part of China and looked at China as its loving mother.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  There was no invasion. They have always been part of China.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  In fact, they told me that the Great Wall of China was just built to show off China's ability to build grand structures.
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  There was no Mongol invasion. That never happened.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  Hong Kong was a friend of China and they all just solidly believe this. It's incredible. It's an alternate reality.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  So we talk about brainwashing. You're saying that's why China is the globalist model.
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  It's a brainwashed population that does whatever they want and goes against reality.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  Exactly. And you can see the hallmarks of what's happening there happening here.
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  And that's what's very frightening, the censorship, the oppression.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  And our government, they're gas-lying as well. The DHS just released a statement where they said,
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  we are very concerned about the lack of freedom of speech happening in China right now.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  And we think it's just terrible what the Chinese government is doing to their citizens and not allowing them to have free seats.
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  While they do everything they can to shut us down here.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  To shut us down, to shut you down, to shut OAN down.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  We've had people, this is what's terrifying. OAN has actually had people in Congress, politicians,
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  who are sworn to uphold the Constitution, right to AT&T and say, we need to get you off the air.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  They're just spreading misinformation.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  To be as a society, when you get to that point where free speech is no longer sacred, it's terrifying.
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  That was my next question. What do you make of one of the big NBA owners saying, I don't even care about the Uyghurs.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  I don't care about death camps and the attempts to take OAN off the air. What's your view on that?
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  Well, it's more of the same. I mean, it's not surprising at all. Like I said before, we know they don't care about us.
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  They have their agenda. They have their ivory towers.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  The secret behind every Democrat is they want to be an aristocrat.
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  They want to create a new monarchy where they are the elite and everybody else is a peasant.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  They don't care about what happens to us at all.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  So, of course, they don't care about the Uyghurs. It doesn't affect them. It doesn't matter.
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  They don't care what happens to any of us. It could be Americans if that's happening too.
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  As long as it doesn't affect them, it doesn't...
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  Well, that's right. I've had meetings with Globalist Off-Record and they go, look, you're an elite.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  You know all this. Join us. Screw the general public.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  And they literally think I'm attacking the aristocrats, the aristocracy, because I want to be them.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  No, I want to renaissance. I want to empower humanity.
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  I don't get off on ripping people off and screwing them over. And then they see me as a weak chump.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  But overall, what they create is a nightmare civilization.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  Yeah, they do. And that's the end goal. It is literally going to look like 1984. That's their instruction manual.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  And we have to fight back. We have to stand up.
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  And like I said, I don't know where the powder kick moment is going to be, but they've stretched us so far.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  They've pushed us so far, rubber bands got to snap. We can't go much further than this.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  That's right. Well, I think they plan to snap back and cause a giant revolution to collapse the society.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  We don't want that to happen either. That's what we've got to be.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  As wise as serpents and peaceful as doves, Pearson Sharp, very impressed with what you do.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  At Pearson Sharp on Getter and Twitter. Thank you so much.
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  Please come back anytime you want. If OAN will let you, we'd love you to guest host sometime.
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  We'd love you to come to Austin. We love OAN. Everybody should watch it.
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  They should share it and word of mouth that just look like they do info wars.
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  Thank you so much for all your time today.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  Absolutely. Thank you, Alex. Truth tellers are few and far between.
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  So we all appreciate what you're doing. Appreciate you.
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  Well, Pearson Sharp is awesome and you can find him on OAN.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  And if he's getting taken off satellite in different systems, well, go find it yourself online at the OAN website and share it.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  Because you can override that tourney. They're taking it down because it was exploding and they can't stand that.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with hour number three with a whistleblower from Australia.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  From Inside Pfizer. Stay with us.
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  Sold out for months. X3 is now back in stock.
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:58:02.000]  and so many people are deficient in iodine. It's not the soil anymore.
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:07.000]  Most of the ocean is contaminated, but when you get high quality tri iodine,
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  all three of the healthy types together, it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido,
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  but most importantly, your immune system. So X3, the only tri iodine on the market,
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:25.000]  highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off at infowarsore.com.
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body takes about two weeks to get it on average,
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  you really need to experience X3. Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the info war. A true 360 win.
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:50.000]  So again, X3 back in stock. 50% off for a limited time.
[1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:58.000]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:02.000]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of,
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:06.000]  our new sleep support formula, down and out, is just the thing.
[1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:23.000]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with down and out, now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees,
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:45.000]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.
[1:59:45.000 --> 2:00:13.000]  Send it out now at infoorstore.com.
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  All right, Syrian girl lives in Australia, and she's worked for Big Pharma,
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:23.000]  and she was pro-vaccine until she saw what happened there as she's joining us next segment.
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:29.000]  She's had a lot to talk about in Australia, so we're going to get all the clips of the Australian police brutality and arresting old ladies,
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  and the people fighting back now and all the beautiful stuff that's happening coming up next segment.
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  But I really want to air this Greg Reaves report that needs to get out because the battle plan you see in Canada being used against the people there,
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  the battle plan for every other country.
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  This is Big Pharma corporate tyranny.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  This is how the cowardly corporations launched their attacks.
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  So here is that report.
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  Trudeau deploys globalist police force.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  Our government has been in close contact with the mayor of Ottawa, the municipal and provincial officials.
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  So far, the RCMP has mobilized nearly 300 officers to support the Ottawa police services and is ready to do more.
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  Rather than face the Canadian people, Justin Trudeau is sickening his police on them.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  Governments have been hiring globalist players and thugs for years.
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  Meet Peter Slowly, known for being woke.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  Seven years ago as deputy police chief, Peter Slowly said that being black made him a suitable candidate for Toronto's next police chief
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  and claimed a more important factor was his experience as a United Nations peacekeeper,
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  an international police force known for raping and pillaging communities under the flag of peace.
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  It was reported that there was much animosity when Slowly was not chosen to be Toronto's first black police chief.
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  And a year later, he resigned.
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  During his resignation speech, he bragged about tempting offers coming from the international private sector
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  and went on immediately to join the company Deloitte, who's CEO sits on the board of directors at Pfizer
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  and who was awarded over $40 million by the CDC to build a vaccine management system.
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  A couple months before the COVID-19 scandemic, Peter Slowly was made chief of the Ottawa police.
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  While the world celebrates the inspiring human spirit coming from the people of Canada,
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  their own police steal their gasoline to freeze them out.
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  Families and children and the foundations of an incoming false flag are now being identified.
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  Meet Peter Downing, a former cop for the RCMP who was given full pay and a clean record after a criminal conviction.
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  Downing is the head of WEGZIT, an Alberta separist movement seeking to overrule Canadian law
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  with decrees set by the United Nations and funded by a woman who sits on the board of the Atlantic Council.
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  The Atlantic Council founded CrowdStrike, which ties them to Hillary Clinton.
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  They are funded by George Soros and the Ukraine's Barisma.
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  They are considered a threat to constitutional order by the Russian government and they fund Peter Downing's WEGZIT.
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  WEGZIT has made itself a part of the Ottawa protests and their connections to George Soros and the RCMP should be cause for alarm.
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  People need to be on the lookout for state-sponsored shenanigans.
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  We've been told that one of the triggers or indicators where we know that they are going to physically move against us and start arresting us
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  is when our media goes down, when all of our telecommunications devices do go down, when we go fully black,
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  the next phase of this will be the public order units will move in on us and start kettling.
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  This is it. If there's a media blackout of everybody that you're connected to with this freedom convoy,
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  that's your trigger that you know something is up and I would encourage you to make arrangements and immediately start heading to Ottawa.
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  Trudeau's Liberals are now scurrying to pass their new anti-hate laws straight out of communist China,
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  where a Canadian can be fined $70,000 in thrown in jail for up to four years for the crime of posting anything on the internet that the government deems inappropriate.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[2:05:17.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  All three of the healthy types together, it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly your immune system.
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:35.000]  So, X3, the only tri-iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50%off at InfoWars.com.
[2:05:35.000 --> 2:05:43.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body, it takes about two weeks to get on average, you really need to experience X3.
[2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:51.000]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what does for your body,
[2:05:51.000 --> 2:05:56.000]  it's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the InfoWars, a true 360 win.
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  So again, X3, back at stock, 50% off.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  If the government served the people, then the government would have nothing to fear from the people.
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:37.000]  But it is clear that now the government fears us.
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  After years of persistent abuse of the Constitution, during which time they have betrayed, robbed, injured, and killed the Australian people,
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:47.000]  we have had enough, and we are not alone.
[2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  Internationally, the people are rising up peacefully against the unlawful and criminal excesses of those whom they have elected.
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  Millions of good and decent men and women around the world have decided that this war for the world must end,
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  and they know it will end when enough of us stand up and declare in one voice, no more.
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:11.000]  Here in Australia, the people are gathering in the nation's capital, Canberra, in order to communicate their intent,
[2:07:11.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  that the Governor-General should meet his constitutional responsibility by dissolving the parliament and appointing a new Executive Council
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:23.000]  in order to prepare for free and fair elections.
[2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  In the long journey from barbarism to civilisation, days such as these are rare.
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  Seminal days, when a people band together, putting aside their petty differences in order to secure their lives and their liberty.
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  In other words, to earn their rights to their sovereign nationhood.
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  Now is the time to play your part in the liberation of Australia.
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  Now is the time to stand alongside your fellow Australians and resist tyranny.
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:52.000]  Now is the time to ensure your children and grandchildren are free.
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  You were here because generations ago, your ancestors sacrificed all for you.
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  It is now time to pay that debt for you.
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  Now, nothing else matters.
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:05.000]  This is not about politics. This is a non-political event.
[2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  This is about our very lives and our very future.
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  You must drop everything and get to Canberra as soon as you can.
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:17.000]  Some have made their way from Farah Field as Adelaide, Melbourne and Rockhampton.
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  What's your excuse?
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:23.000]  And they plan to stay until we win.
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  Remain calm regardless of the force used against you.
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:32.000]  They will provoke a reaction which ultimately will see the use of police snipers opening fire.
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  This is a reality.
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  Regardless of the force used against you, we must remain calm in order to win.
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  Fly, drive, walk if you must.
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:47.000]  But we need an army of millions in Canberra to win this war.
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:50.000]  And we will win if you attend.
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:52.000]  Pack up as much food and water as you can.
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  The people already there are sharing and cooperating as never before.
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  If you can't find accommodations, sleep in your car.
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  We must come together now.
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  This is our time.
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:04.000]  We the people.
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  Do it for your family and do it for the future of Australia.
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  I'm Ricardo Bozzi.
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  I'm looking forward to seeing you there.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  It's our number three.
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  Wednesday, February 9th, 2022.
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  And to say we're living in epic times is an extreme understatement.
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  Look at the power of humanity from Australia to Canada,
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  from Germany to Brazil,
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  all over the world in Africa and the Middle East and across Asia.
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  In Russia, people are saying no to the vaccine mandates,
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  no to the vaccine passports,
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  and no to Klaus Schwab and the Great Reset.
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  Epic, epic, epic.
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  And suddenly, as soon as people begin to demonstrate and march and say no,
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  oh, the Democratic Party says we don't want to wear masks.
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  We don't want to make you take the shot.
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  It's whatever they can get, whatever the bullies can grab, they will do.
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  Why was Australia and Canada and New Zealand picked as the main targets?
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  Well, because the Anglo-American, British East India Company,
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  Cecil Rhodes Combine, it's not blaming the British people,
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  but was based out of there,
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  had a world empire through a corporate system already set up.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  The British Empire was a corporate system.
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  And now the New World Order is just that system taking over.
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  And of course, it sucks dry the British and the Scots and the Irish
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  and the Americans and the Australians and the Canadians and the New Zealanders
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  that pay for it.
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:48.000]  We're the muscle of it, the ingenuity of the brains,
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  but they're the parasite on top.
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:55.000]  So Syrian girls have been coming on the show since the whole Syrian conflict started
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:10:57.000]  seems like a decade ago now.
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  Her family was part of the ruling party there,
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  actually got kicked out by Assad,
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  but she was still against that false war,
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  which has been proven to be a fraud,
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  helped expose massive false flags and more with us.
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  She's a geopolitical analyst and chemist.
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  She's 100% Syrian to the core
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  and comes from a former ruling class family that was deposed by the Baptist coup.
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:17.000]  She resides in Western Australia,
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  with a crackdown on the unvaccinated is the worst.
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:23.000]  She is the eyewitness account of the COVID-19 measures having been implemented there.
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  During her days at Pfizer,
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  she was also a quality control chemist,
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  and her job was to check the drugs were safe.
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  And early on, she was pro-vaccine,
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  because it's a real technology, can really work and be great.
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  But now she's turned against what's happening.
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  She's on Twitter at Partisan Girl,
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  YouTube, Syrian Girl Partisan Telegram,
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:43.000]  Syrian Girl Partisan.
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  Syrian Girl, I feel like your family,
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  I've known you so long, you've come on so many times on all the shows.
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  God bless you.
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  I'm going to try to shut up, because you know I interrupt a lot.
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  You've got the floor to talk about why is Australia the main target?
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:56.000]  What's happening with these shots?
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  We couldn't have a better person to really give us the inside scoop.
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:00.000]  So thank you so much.
[2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  And I know it's really the middle of the night there in Australia.
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  So thank you.
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:05.000]  No, thank you, Alex.
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  Thanks for having me on.
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  It's always an honor to be here.
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  You do such great work.
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  You know, you've been fighting this since before my war in Syria.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  You've always warned us about the globalists
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  and pretty much everything you said was going to happen is now happening.
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  I wasn't pro-vax, especially not a vax that's so experimental as this is.
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  In fact, I made a video in 2020 in about April,
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  kind of exposing this whole thing, Bill Gates, ID 2020,
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:35.000]  but it immediately got censored off YouTube.
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  And I saw the climate, what it was like,
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:41.000]  and I just sort of moved away and went to Telegram
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  because I knew that the social media was going to censor it.
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  Well, I'm sorry for misrepresenting that.
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  The point is you're not against vaccines in total, though.
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  Yeah, you're absolutely correct.
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  Yes, that is absolutely correct.
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  And in fact, at the beginning,
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  I did think that the virus might be dangerous
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  because I believe it was a biological weapon.
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:01.000]  Obviously, it's mutated a lot since then,
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:03.000]  and now it's basically just the cold.
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:06.000]  But I do think my job, Professor,
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  was to make sure that these drugs are safe.
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  And we had all of these rules to follow
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  to make sure that's the case,
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  and all of that's been thrown out the window.
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  It's just such a weird coincidence
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  that I also used to work for Pfizer,
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  and I come on to your show to talk about Syria.
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  But there is something that's really bugging me,
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:27.000]  and that's when they keep telling us to trust the science.
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  Because obviously, the whole point of science
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  is that you shouldn't trust it.
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  You should do experiments.
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  You should get data.
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  And then you shouldn't even trust that.
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  You should continually test things.
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  But for some reason,
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  science is now being treated as a religion,
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  and people are being forced to be part of an experiment.
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  It's completely unethical.
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  It's against everything we were supposedly told.
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  But this is not the first time that Pfizer was up to no good.
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  In fact, Nigeria is suing them for $7 billion
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  for experimenting on children
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  with an anti meningitis drug,
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  which ended up killing 11 kids.
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  And they had vaccines as well.
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  I said I support some vaccines,
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  but it's not like you can just assume that they're always safe.
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  Vaccines have been pulled from the market before.
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  We had the dengue fever vaccine,
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  which they gave to 300,000 children
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  before they realized that it actually caused them
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  to get sicker once they got the virus.
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  And we have AstraZeneca here in Australia.
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  AstraZeneca being one of the COVID-19 vaccines.
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  In Australia, they pulled it from the market.
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  And only like 12 months ago,
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:48.000]  they were telling everyone it was safe.
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  And I find this completely,
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  it's like they're gaslighting us
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  because we're not allowed to question things.
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  And yet the very vaccines that 12 months ago they told us
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:01.000]  were safe are being pulled from the market.
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  It's against everything you learn as a chemist
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:06.000]  and what we were told supposedly
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  when we were checking for quality of these drugs.
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:13.000]  And I would definitely want to go on to talk to you
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  about the biological weapons aspect of this if I can
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  and what we've been experiencing here living in Australia
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  and how this is a worldwide thing
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  because this is the world economic form
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:31.000]  and pushing this thing from the top down.
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  And they've somehow infiltrated
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  all of these governments around the world.
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  Certainly they've infiltrated Australia heavily.
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  And now it's not just about the vaccines.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:45.000]  They're bringing in a digital identity
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  in order to create a carbon quota.
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:49.000]  Well, that's right.
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  That's the wedge they use as the virus to get in.
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  Once they have the global idea, they've got it all.
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:55.000]  Syrian girls are guest stay with us.
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  Experience the next level in high powered energy
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  new tropics with our latest brain force offering
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:04.000]  Brain Force Ultra.
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:08.000]  Now it is easier than ever to take in the new liquid form
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:10.000]  with eight beneficial super ingredients.
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:14.000]  Brain Force Ultra is the result of years of enhanced formulation.
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:17.000]  Three of toxic additives each ingredient is specifically
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  selected for its many key properties.
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:22.000]  Some of the proprietary super ingredients
[2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:25.000]  behind Brain Force Ultra include Guarana seed,
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:28.000]  which is loaded with energy compounds and antioxidants
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  that have been used by Amazonian tribes for centuries.
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:35.000]  Alpha GPC, a natural compound found in the brain
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  that delivers an essential nutrient, Koli and Ginkoli,
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant content.
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:44.000]  This product is more than twice the servings
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  of our Brain Force Plus as well,
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  so you know it's packed full of the good stuff.
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  Destroy that brain fog today
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:53.000]  and secure your bottle of Brain Force Ultra
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  before it is completely sold out
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  at M4store.com.
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart,
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:03.000]  deep in my soul.
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:06.000]  I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet,
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:09.000]  I've had a lot of loss like everybody else has.
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:22.000]  that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for.
[2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:27.000]  And I see the general public,
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:30.000]  ENA, medically induced, scientifically induced,
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:33.000]  behavioral, psychologically controlled,
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:34.000]  tranquy.
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:37.000]  And I know we're being fed into this global speaker
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:39.000]  and it's so incredibly sad.
[2:17:39.000 --> 2:17:44.000]  But this is the process of birth and then growth
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:47.000]  and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  and then coming back to life again.
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:55.000]  and control this process of decadence and collapse
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  to actually end the species as we know it.
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:18:00.000]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  They're here, all over the world,
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:04.000]  from Australia to the United States,
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:05.000]  from Canada to Germany.
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do,
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:09.000]  everywhere you go, and then coming to your house
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  and threatening, in some cases,
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:14.000]  actually taking people away into the night
[2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  to their facilities.
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:17.000]  And they're planning in the next year
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  to expand their shield process
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:21.000]  where they come and take, quote,
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:23.000]  healthy people away and put them in facilities
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:24.000]  for their safety.
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:26.000]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:28.000]  And one big thing you can do to fight back
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:30.000]  is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:32.000]  many of which are made here in America
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:33.000]  and are very compliant,
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:35.000]  meaning U.S. government military grade
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:37.000]  at infowarstore.com.

[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  We've got them for cell phones.
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:49.000]  We've got them for laptops.
[2:18:49.000 --> 2:18:50.000]  We've got them for iPads.

[2:18:58.000 --> 2:18:59.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:01.000]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[2:19:01.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  Welcome.
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:03.000]  Hello, Alex.
[2:19:03.000 --> 2:19:04.000]  Yes, Malcolm.
[2:19:04.000 --> 2:19:06.000]  All right, I will make this quick and real short
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  where the other patriots can get on the line.
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  Alex, I have to promote one thing
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:12.000]  from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:15.000]  Supermell Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:17.000]  Mix those two together.
[2:19:17.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:20.000]  Supermell Vitality really, really works.
[2:19:20.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  that have never been heated up.
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:32.000]  that also work quite well but just aren't as strong.
[2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  This is like a very fine wine.
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:36.000]  In fact, each batch is different.
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just OK.
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:40.000]  People are like, why are you selling something
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:43.000]  That's just how it is.
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:44.000]  It's how it works.
[2:19:44.000 --> 2:19:46.000]  So it's always good.
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price,
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:20:07.000]  then this is it.
[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  Well, Syrian Girl is our special guest
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:34.000]  coming on with us for close to a decade.
[2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:37.000]  She is a geopolitical analyst, chemist,
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:40.000]  and she has really been an expert
[2:20:40.000 --> 2:20:42.000]  on so much what's happening in the world.
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:44.000]  So get into the big picture as an Australian,
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:46.000]  what you're seeing unfold, the great reset,
[2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:48.000]  what's happening in the country currently
[2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:50.000]  and where you think this is all going
[2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:52.000]  and where you think this is going.
[2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  And I think that's the contribution
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  that I can bring to the show.
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:20:57.000]  Yes, please.
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  Thank you so much.
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:01.000]  Well, you know, Pfizer, as I said previously,
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  the company has some of the best products
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:06.000]  that are available in the world.
[2:21:06.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  And I think that's the best product
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:10.000]  that's available in the world.
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  And I think that's the best product
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  that's available in the world.
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:16.000]  And I think that's the best product
[2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:18.000]  that's available in the world.
[2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  The company has some of the worst history
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:23.000]  when it comes to side effects.
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  And you're right.
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  I was never an anti-Baxter.
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  Obviously, I worked in the pharmaceutical industry.
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:30.000]  But in this case, I'm just shocked
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  that they're coming out with vaccines,
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:35.000]  you know, without even testing
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:37.000]  whether they're safe or effective.
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:39.000]  And clearly, they haven't been able
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  to stop the spread using these vaccines.
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  You know, you can still acquire the virus,
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:46.000]  even if you take it.
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  And yet, they're still introducing these mandates.
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:51.000]  They make absolutely no sense.
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:21:53.000]  And yes, as shown in your screen,
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:56.000]  you know, they're getting so much money out of this
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:22:00.000]  from taxpayers, even though the taxes were used
[2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  to create the vaccine in the first place.
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:05.000]  And any side effects that are happening,
[2:22:05.000 --> 2:22:08.000]  they have indemnity, so they can't be sued.
[2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  It's complete garbage.
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:13.000]  But, you know, I want to discuss a bit more
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:16.000]  about the biological weapon possibility
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  or aspect of this.
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  You know, there's a lot of suspicious stuff
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  that was happening before, you know,
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  you had Bill Gates came up with this ID 2020
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  just before, like, in December 2019,
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  just before the outbreak, where he was proposing
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:32.000]  this business model where you can link,
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  like, quantum dots inside the vaccine
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  as a form of digital identification.
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:39.000]  So the building blocks of this were already there.
[2:22:39.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  But the most important thing, I mean,
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  I'm sure your viewers have heard of gain of function
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:44.000]  and whatnot.
[2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:46.000]  But the most important thing is,
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  I can tell you guys, is that there's a 19-length sequence
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:54.000]  of the RNA in the COVID-19 virus
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:59.000]  that exactly matches that of a Moderna patent from 2018,
[2:22:59.000 --> 2:23:02.000]  which was for HIV vaccine.
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:04.000]  And this is a bit more technical,
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  but that sequence occurs in the most suspicious part
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  of the SARS virus, the coronavirus 19,
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  is the foreign cleavage site
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:15.000]  that has the sequence from HIV.
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:18.000]  That sequence has never occurred before in history.
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  And so the chance of it occurring randomly in nature
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  is, like, over a billion to one.
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  And a few days ago, Moderna just released
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  a new HIV mRNA vaccine.
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  So I wonder if that's just a coincidence.
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  And I want to say that why are they so insistent
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:38.000]  on using mRNA? And that's because they want to insert
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:42.000]  RNA into people to create not just proteins,
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  but what Microsoft are calling biological circuits
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:50.000]  and what the World Economic Forum
[2:23:50.000 --> 2:23:52.000]  are calling hacking humans.
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:56.000]  I mean, these are the words from their own mouths.
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:24:00.000]  And I think that these guys are insane
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  because they themselves call themselves the global elite.
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  I mean, I don't know.
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:08.000]  It's exactly what you warned us about all of these years.
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  And I think that it was meant to be a much more dangerous virus.
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  But because coronavirus mutates so rapidly,
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:16.000]  it wasn't as initially planned,
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:20.000]  but they're still going ahead and pushing with the agenda
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  for digital identification.
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  And, you know, here in Australia,
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  I'm in the belly of the beast.
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  You can see that's the Prime Minister of Australia
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  getting his instructions from the World Economic Forum.
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  And, you know, they were just like patting him on the back
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  because he was introducing digital ID.
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  And it shows you what their plan is.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  Their plan is that you can't go anywhere
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  without informing the government where you're going,
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  what you're buying. That's what we have here.
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  So right now, I can't go inside a hospital.
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:55.000]  I'm barred from going to hospitals
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  where people are being laid off work.
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  Women are being turned away from hospitals and their babies.
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  For some reason, also, I'm not allowed in the zoo.
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  I don't know why they chose to shut down the zoo
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:10.000]  for the unvaccinated.
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  But it's just like punishing people
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  who have made a choice not to be part of the experiment.
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  Well, that's right.
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  Again, Syrian girl or Maram Sousa Lee is her real name.
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  She's a chemist, a well-known journalist.
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  This is so huge.
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  But I want you to go back,
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  and then we'll come back next segment with more time
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  and get into first thing, you can't see old people in nursing homes.
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  They could kill them in Australia and the U.S.
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  It was all U.N. runs. It was all over the world.
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  And then now saying, children that are sick,
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  parents can't see them, truly terrorizing people.
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:39.000]  We'll talk about that next segment.
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:41.000]  But going back, I remember the Indian University
[2:25:41.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  scanned the virus and said,
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  it's got the HIV spike protein man-made delivery system.
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  And it turns out Fauci and Moderna and Bill Gates and others,
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:51.000]  as you said, have connections to it.
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  And it's clearly man-made.
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  And now top scientists have confirmed that.
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  Now we're seeing all these extra HIV cases,
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  HIV false positives for people that have had the vaccine,
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  even Forbes saying, scientists warn
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  that you've got an increased chance of getting HIV
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  if you've had the vaccine.
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  We know Fauci was involved in the rollout of HIV.
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  We know this.
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:13.000]  So this looks very diabolical,
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  and we know there's a lot of health problems
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  with those that have taken the shots.
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  But what we're hearing from a lot of scientists
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  is actually turning off the killer T's in the white blood cells.
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  So the T cells actually,
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  it's like the tumor necrosis factor.
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  They fight cancer.
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  So, you know, it is part of your immune system.
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:37.000]  And of course, it would, you know,
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  AIDS is supposed to be the disease that HIV causes.
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  And that is where your immune system no longer works
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:49.000]  to fight, you know, to mountain defense.
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:52.000]  The thing is that we don't even know
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:54.000]  what's going to happen with these.
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  That's the most terrifying thing.
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  We don't even know what will happen.
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:01.000]  The time is going to show itself.
[2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:05.000]  But the fact that Fauci was one of the leading scientists
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  when it comes to AIDS, the links between this HIV, 19,
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  this 19-length sequence of RNA in that virus,
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:25.000]  in coronavirus, matches a patent that Moderna had since 2018
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  for a HIV vaccine.
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  That just can't be a coincidence.
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  It's impossible.
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  It's scientifically impossible.
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:37.000]  And it's not a coincidence that he ran the program
[2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  of gain of function, that he lied about it.
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  And he's a depopulationist.
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:42.000]  I mean, he's caught red-handed.
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  This is insane.
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:47.000]  Yes, and he was funding the Wuhan lab.
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:49.000]  I mean, it's just bizarre.
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  It was also suspicious about the fact
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  that this all happened in China.
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:58.000]  The virus was released during Chinese New Year.
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  That's me when I was in Pfizer.
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  Yes, so it was just when people were about to travel.
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  So it was kind of like the perfect timing
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  for a disease to really spread,
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:13.000]  which was the intention, I believe,
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  of releasing it at that time.
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  All right, stay there.
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  That is just so huge.
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  And it's admitted.
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  It's even in the news.
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  Oh, and she's got the HIV spike patented.
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  It popped up in this at a lab he ran.
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  But it's all natural.
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  And they approached the Pentagon.
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  But when you release it in China 2017,
