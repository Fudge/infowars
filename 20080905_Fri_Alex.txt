[00:19.380 --> 00:42.440]  Texas Alex Jones there is a point is there point let's find a point
[00:42.440 --> 00:52.760]  to my act I would say there is I have to the world is like a ride at an
[00:52.760 --> 00:55.700]  amusement park and when you choose to go on it you think it's real because
[00:55.700 --> 00:59.320]  that's how powerful our minds are and the ride goes up and down and round and
[00:59.320 --> 01:02.640]  round it has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored and it's very
[01:02.640 --> 01:07.480]  loud and it's fun for a while some people have been on the ride for a long
[01:07.480 --> 01:11.720]  time and they begin to question is this real or is this just a ride and other
[01:11.720 --> 01:15.280]  people have remembered and they come back to us and they say hey don't worry
[01:15.280 --> 01:23.160]  don't be afraid ever because this is just a ride and we kill those people
[01:23.160 --> 01:30.240]  shut him up we have a lot invested in this ride shut him up look at my furrows
[01:30.240 --> 01:37.360]  of worry look at my big bank account and my family this has to be real it's
[01:37.360 --> 01:41.560]  just a ride but we always kill those good guys who try and tell us that you
[01:41.560 --> 01:48.080]  never notice that and let the demons run amok but it doesn't matter because it's
[01:48.080 --> 01:54.240]  just a ride and we can change it anytime we want it's only a choice no effort no
[01:54.240 --> 02:00.640]  work no job no savings of money a choice right now between fear and love the eyes
[02:00.640 --> 02:05.720]  of fear once you put bigger locks on your door by guns close yourself off the
[02:05.720 --> 02:09.960]  eyes of love instead see all of us as one here's what we can do to change the
[02:09.960 --> 02:14.960]  world right now to a better ride take all that money we spend on weapons and
[02:14.960 --> 02:18.720]  defense each year and instead spend it feeding clothing and educating the poor
[02:18.720 --> 02:22.200]  of the world which it would many times over not one human being excluded and
[02:22.200 --> 02:31.280]  we can explore space together both inner and outer forever in peace thank you
[02:31.280 --> 02:46.800]  very much you've been great I hope you enjoy it Alex Jones here live with you
[02:46.800 --> 02:53.000]  today on this Friday edition there's Bill Hicks my good buddy Kevin both
[02:53.000 --> 03:00.720]  produced and started off in comedian line and it makes a lot of sense what
[03:00.720 --> 03:07.340]  Bill Hicks was saying the problem is that not caring about things is the
[03:07.340 --> 03:14.400]  mirror image but from a good perspective of what the New World Order is doing do
[03:14.400 --> 03:19.600]  as thou wilt they say it's just a ride and it doesn't matter so why shouldn't I
[03:19.600 --> 03:30.680]  rape and kill and steal and starve and backstab and cheat why shouldn't I do
[03:30.680 --> 03:34.680]  whatever I want and then you've got the other side that the really evil people
[03:34.680 --> 03:38.640]  that say yeah it's just right you've got the good people like Bill Hicks but who
[03:38.640 --> 03:43.680]  have limited perspective and so from there giving loving genuine perspective
[03:43.680 --> 03:48.760]  and that's how Bill Hicks really was in personal life then you see the world from
[03:48.760 --> 03:52.240]  your own view not understanding that good people have to have power just to
[03:52.240 --> 03:57.640]  protect themselves from the evil and the evil always combines forces and then
[03:57.640 --> 04:07.200]  moves against the good sound a great what Bill was saying about take all the
[04:07.200 --> 04:10.960]  money we have for defense and give it to the poor the problem is there's going
[04:10.960 --> 04:13.440]  to be bureaucrats there's going to be corporations there's going to be elites
[04:13.440 --> 04:18.320]  who sell the general public the middle class who has some of the wealth not for
[04:18.320 --> 04:21.000]  long most of it's already been transferred to the elite in the name of
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.240]  helping the poor and then the elite only uses that money to control and dumb
[04:25.240 --> 04:28.960]  down and isolate and break up the families of the poor and then carry out
[04:28.960 --> 04:33.160]  eugenics operations against them as the Royal Commission on population stated
[04:33.160 --> 04:39.680]  put out 1949 with the British government as State Department random 200 stated
[04:39.680 --> 04:46.480]  put out in 73 so see they take our good intentions and sell us on evil so we
[04:46.480 --> 04:51.520]  have to be three-dimensional we have to play chess not checkers prison planet

[09:11.120 --> 09:16.080]  9-11 truth and how it's becoming mainstream that government sponsors
[09:16.080 --> 09:20.720]  terror there's more and more mainstream news articles about past instances the
[09:20.720 --> 09:24.760]  declassified examples of government staging terror attacks to turn their
[09:24.760 --> 09:29.960]  countries into police states and or generally together to launch attacks on
[09:29.960 --> 09:36.800]  neighbors or to expand the Empire so that is coming up today Luke Radowski

[09:48.120 --> 09:57.600]  coming up we have a lot of important news on the economy front on the economics
[09:57.600 --> 10:03.600]  front we also have a lot of new developments between the US NATO and
[10:03.600 --> 10:10.600]  Russia there's also interesting corruption news like this out of a London
[10:10.600 --> 10:16.720]  independent Cheney colleague admits bribery and Halliburton oil deals such
[10:16.720 --> 10:21.440]  as wall-to-wall corruption right out in the open nothing being done about that
[10:21.440 --> 10:26.120]  a you see it isn't just that we have corrupt leaders we've been trained by
[10:26.120 --> 10:30.480]  Bill Clinton and George Bush and others to just accept corruption all they all
[10:30.480 --> 10:35.440]  steal and yeah there's trillions missing from the Pentagon the trust funds have
[10:35.440 --> 10:39.720]  been liquidated but so what what are you some kind of dirty hippie trillions
[10:39.720 --> 10:45.680]  missing is no big deal the Democrats defend their corrupt party the Republicans
[10:45.680 --> 10:48.400]  defend their corrupt party because they're too busy fighting with each other
[10:48.400 --> 10:51.960]  well I'm fighting with the Republicans so it doesn't matter how bad my party is
[10:51.960 --> 10:55.840]  I'm fighting with the evil liberals we can't let them take over so we got to
[10:55.840 --> 11:00.120]  back up any corruption our parties involved in and then both parties are
[11:00.120 --> 11:03.520]  owned by the same corporate interest and they control the entire paradigm and the
[11:03.520 --> 11:07.840]  general public is locked out of any decision-making process and the corrupt
[11:07.840 --> 11:12.640]  as they've done throughout history become megalomaniacal and drunk with
[11:12.640 --> 11:17.080]  power and start becoming self-destructive that is always the
[11:17.080 --> 11:22.640]  byproduct of unlimited unbridled imperial hubris is self-destructive
[11:22.640 --> 11:28.040]  tendencies there's some of the big news this from Peter del Scott it's up on
[11:28.040 --> 11:33.800]  info wars.com Bush extends at 9-11 national emergency yet again from
[11:33.800 --> 11:39.240]  global research that's right we were put under martial law each year he has to
[11:39.240 --> 11:44.120]  reauthorize the martial law we are under continuity of government under Cheyenne
[11:44.120 --> 11:51.120]  Mountains control and it openly states that Congress is a marionette not even
[11:51.120 --> 11:56.880]  a marionette Congress is vestigial you know a dog halfway up their leg has
[11:56.880 --> 12:03.400]  another claw and I guess they say that in previous incarnations of canine what
[12:03.400 --> 12:10.960]  it's canine familiar is today that that claw was down on the foot regardless it
[12:10.960 --> 12:19.200]  has no use it is vestigial just like horses have a vestigial pad on their
[12:19.200 --> 12:28.520]  elbow as well vestigial the Congress is vestigial and I mean that in every
[12:28.520 --> 12:33.680]  instance the word we will not get the Congress back until the shadow government
[12:33.680 --> 12:38.440]  has been exposed Minnesota prosecution of activists leads way to
[12:38.440 --> 12:41.960]  characterize dissent as terrorism they've charged them under the Minnesota
[12:41.960 --> 12:47.640]  Patriot Act of wanton riot under a terrorism act they're facing felonies
[12:47.640 --> 12:54.160]  two members of two anchors of free speech TV democracy now we're also charged
[12:54.160 --> 12:59.520]  under the felony terrorism charge on video for covering the event they just
[12:59.520 --> 13:05.080]  randomly arrested people this is in a separate event they're charging eight so
[13:05.080 --> 13:10.440]  I thought I'd play a few minutes of this you see just Google Patriot Act use in
[13:10.440 --> 13:15.400]  non-terror related cases or locals use Patriot Act and you'll see stuff from
[13:15.400 --> 13:21.520]  2003 2004 2005 just a few years after it with headlines like Alabama's use it
[13:21.520 --> 13:25.560]  more than a thousand times or Ohio's use it more than a hundred thousand times
[13:25.560 --> 13:29.880]  you know go back read it for yourself Texas uses the Patriot Act hundreds of
[13:29.880 --> 13:35.920]  thousands of times no judge no jury no nothing no due process it's happening
[13:35.920 --> 13:43.040]  all around you ladies and gentlemen there the government is rogue it's
[13:43.040 --> 13:47.520]  criminal they're looting everything the last official act as Mike Rivera likes
[13:47.520 --> 13:52.160]  to say of a criminal government is to loot everything they are looting and all
[13:52.160 --> 13:55.640]  and leaving a vanguard police state behind to protect their retreat to
[13:55.640 --> 14:01.480]  Europe and to the Bahamas and to their luxury private islands with black water
[14:01.480 --> 14:07.920]  protection services and Pinkerton I'm not kidding this is a mass raping and
[14:07.920 --> 14:11.800]  police you better figure out you're being used in brainwash and federalized
[14:11.800 --> 14:16.560]  and turned against us I don't want a violent revolution but you're making one
[14:16.560 --> 14:22.800]  inevitable and I will be crushed in that you will be crushed in that anyone with
[14:22.800 --> 14:27.240]  power will be attacked in the type of thing that's coming which is also going
[14:27.240 --> 14:30.720]  to be engineered by the bankers after they're done leaving the US they're
[14:30.720 --> 14:35.360]  going to set up a communist style takeover not going to call it that they're
[14:35.360 --> 14:39.840]  going to kill probably a hundred million people in this country if we
[14:39.840 --> 14:44.480]  watch that I'm not joking around about that you figure that out I don't say
[14:44.480 --> 14:50.840]  that for effect okay anybody with more than a you know a two-bedroom house is
[14:50.840 --> 14:56.160]  going to be in deep trouble this is going to be hellish with Latin America
[14:56.160 --> 15:00.560]  turned loose on the United States let's go ahead and play part of Amy Goodman
[15:00.560 --> 15:04.760]  this is an incredible development Ramsey County prosecutors have formally
[15:04.760 --> 15:09.280]  charged eight members of a prominent activist group with conspiracy to riot
[15:09.280 --> 15:13.400]  and furtherance of terrorism the eight members of the RNC welcoming committee
[15:13.400 --> 15:17.240]  are believed to be the first person's ever charged under the 2002 Minnesota
[15:17.240 --> 15:21.560]  version of the Federal Patriot Act the activists face up to seven and a half
[15:21.560 --> 15:26.480]  years in prison Ramsey County Attorney Susan Gertner announced the charges at
[15:26.480 --> 15:31.600]  a news conference Wednesday through this week I've seen much about my great
[15:31.600 --> 15:36.240]  city to celebrate but it also in some ways has been a sad and painful time
[15:36.240 --> 15:41.240]  for my community we have watched as a few lawless people tried to overshadow
[15:41.240 --> 15:47.400]  the peaceful protests and the exercise of free speech rights by thousands of
[15:47.400 --> 15:52.480]  law-abiding citizens some of the people who allegedly planned illegal acts to
[15:52.480 --> 15:56.680]  disrupt the convention and our community were thwarted last week when law
[15:56.680 --> 16:01.640]  enforcement agencies executed warrants and made arrests at several locations
[16:01.640 --> 16:06.680]  today my office has charged eight persons with the felony crime of a
[16:06.680 --> 16:11.600]  conspiracy to commit riot in the second degree for their alleged criminal
[16:11.600 --> 16:17.400]  activities as members of the RNC welcoming committee all but one of those
[16:17.400 --> 16:22.000]  persons are currently in custody according to the National Lawyers Guild
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.160]  the criminal complaints filed by the Ramsey County Attorney do not allege
[16:26.160 --> 16:30.280]  that any of the defendants personally engaged in any act of violence or damage
[16:30.280 --> 16:34.160]  to property instead authorities are seeking to hold the eight defendants
[16:34.160 --> 16:38.400]  responsible for acts committed by other individuals during the opening days of
[16:38.400 --> 16:42.440]  the Republican National Convention most of the activists were arrested over the
[16:42.440 --> 16:47.400]  weekend in preemptive house raids none of the defendants of any prior criminal
[16:47.400 --> 16:51.840]  history involving acts of violence authorities are basing their case on
[16:51.840 --> 16:56.160]  paid informants who infiltrated the group the eight activists charged are
[16:56.160 --> 17:02.000]  Monica Bicking, Aaron Trimmer, Luce Gillan, Gibbons, Eric Osland, Nathaniel
[17:02.000 --> 17:07.320]  Secor, Robert Charnick, Garrett Fitzgerald and Max Specter, Ramsey County Sheriff Bob
[17:07.320 --> 17:12.080]  Fletcher explained the terrorism charges. It allowed us to execute search warrants
[17:12.080 --> 17:16.240]  last Saturday as you know on the leadership of the welcoming committee and
[17:16.240 --> 17:22.400]  frankly that severing that leadership and the organization skills from that
[17:22.400 --> 17:25.960]  entire process was huge because a lot of these anarchist groups that came here
[17:25.960 --> 17:29.160]  were supposed to be dedicated to different intersections different
[17:29.160 --> 17:35.320]  different sectors of the city and by taking those maps away really made it
[17:35.320 --> 17:38.640]  harder for them to coordinate their assault on our city and we only removed
[17:38.640 --> 17:43.080]  10% of the problem but the 10% we removed was the coordinating aspect of it.
[17:43.080 --> 17:48.720]  Two guests join me here in St. Paul, Minnesota. Bruce Nestor is president of the
[17:48.720 --> 17:52.080]  Minnesota chapter of National Lawyers Guild and David Bicking is the father of
[17:52.080 --> 17:55.520]  Monica Bicking one of the eight activists charged with conspiracy to
[17:55.520 --> 17:59.800]  riot and furtherance of terrorism. David Bicking lives in Minneapolis welcome
[17:59.800 --> 18:04.400]  both here to our studios at St. Paul Neighborhood Network SPN and public
[18:04.400 --> 18:08.960]  access. Well why don't we start with you Bruce Nestor explain the
[18:08.960 --> 18:13.520]  significance of these charges. These charges are very significant for any
[18:13.520 --> 18:17.360]  political activists or anybody that cares about the right to organize
[18:17.360 --> 18:23.040]  politically or for freedom of speech by equating plans or stated plans to
[18:23.040 --> 18:27.480]  blockade traffic and to try to disrupt the convention with acts of terrorism
[18:27.480 --> 18:32.240]  in the conspiracy nature of the charge where you punish people for what they
[18:32.240 --> 18:37.160]  say or advocate but not for what they do really creates a possibility that
[18:37.160 --> 18:41.760]  anybody organizing a large-scale demonstration at which civil disobedience
[18:41.760 --> 18:45.720]  may be a part of it or where other individuals may then engage in some
[18:45.720 --> 18:49.960]  type of property damage creates the potential that all those organizers
[18:49.960 --> 18:54.000]  can be charged. That's right let's stop right there and then police
[18:54.000 --> 18:58.840]  provocateurs or hirelings they they top over a few trash cans break a few
[18:58.840 --> 19:01.320]  things they run off under police protection which they've been caught
[19:01.320 --> 19:06.400]  doing and then the whole organization goes to prison. Now remember four years
[19:06.400 --> 19:12.720]  ago Senator Menace no pun intended in Oregon with that bill that almost passed
[19:12.720 --> 19:19.240]  saying any protest that blocks traffic life in a forced labor camp Kurt
[19:19.240 --> 19:26.760]  Nemo did a story about the activism being terrorism last night but I mean we
[19:26.760 --> 19:30.640]  need to add to that or Paul or Steve or one of my other writers Kurt's doing an
[19:30.640 --> 19:35.240]  update design on prison planet right now we need to add that to this and show
[19:35.240 --> 19:39.040]  this is something they've been they tried to pass this also three years ago in
[19:39.040 --> 19:44.160]  Rhode Island remember protesting with Senute's life in prison is treason so
[19:44.160 --> 19:50.160]  that's basically what's being set up here also incredible news story from Paul
[19:50.160 --> 19:54.600]  Watson chemtrails are admitted that the government's come right out admitted
[19:54.600 --> 19:59.000]  they are spraying the skies with deadly poison so we'll cover that when we get

[24:08.800 --> 24:15.160]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio about six months ago
[24:15.160 --> 24:19.000]  listeners started calling in saying have you seen this university study have you
[24:19.000 --> 24:22.840]  seen that university study have you seen these different terms like how
[24:22.840 --> 24:28.040]  altitude aerosols spring weather modification programs and we would
[24:28.040 --> 24:32.280]  Google those terms and come up with hundreds of thousands of hits and in
[24:32.280 --> 24:36.240]  the Department of Energy and the Department of Labor and the Department
[24:36.240 --> 24:46.720]  of Agriculture and the Pentagon DARPA MIT Stanford Research Institute foreign
[24:46.720 --> 24:53.800]  universities European Union NATO all admitting in the last six seven years
[24:53.800 --> 25:00.840]  they're doing huge aerial the spraying test by mixing particulates into the jet
[25:00.840 --> 25:05.640]  fuel and they brag about how it then disperses it through the jet engines and
[25:05.640 --> 25:12.360]  how the Nobel Prize winner came up with this plan in the early 90s and that's
[25:12.360 --> 25:17.160]  when it started in the mid 90s suddenly trails would form in a few thousand
[25:17.160 --> 25:24.080]  feet they'd form in the summer they'd stay there for hours and I remember right
[25:24.080 --> 25:28.800]  when it started before anybody was even covering it they would have people in
[25:28.800 --> 25:34.560]  the media make fun of crazies that believe planes are spring and I saw a dish
[25:34.560 --> 25:40.200]  TV or heard a dish TV radio ad that aired in 96 right when all this started in
[25:40.200 --> 25:44.560]  North America would say oh yeah they believe in black helicopters and jets
[25:44.560 --> 25:53.040]  are spraying the skies and Martians are washing cars on the moon you see they
[25:53.040 --> 25:59.080]  they put it out that it was crazy and that you didn't talk about it right as
[25:59.080 --> 26:03.040]  they started it and then suddenly there were black helicopter martial law
[26:03.040 --> 26:06.760]  continuity of government drills everywhere all this stuff was happening
[26:06.760 --> 26:15.000]  but if you covered it they went oh you're that crazy person and I'd say no no
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.040]  it's in the Houston Chronicle the Delta Force crashed downtown it's in the
[26:18.040 --> 26:21.800]  Miami Herald they shot into an all night restaurant they tried to bribe this
[26:21.800 --> 26:25.400]  police chief I went and interviewed him in San Antonio and all these other
[26:25.400 --> 26:28.280]  towns and foreign troops were there I have the police chief and Alice
[26:28.280 --> 26:32.520]  admitting it I have video of it and they'd say doesn't exist isn't real you're
[26:32.520 --> 26:39.160]  crazy so I really didn't cover Kim Trails a lot until about 2000 and then it
[26:39.160 --> 26:42.720]  just got too obvious and people are like why aren't you covering it so I'm sort
[26:42.720 --> 26:47.200]  of doing real research having real researchers on I've been pretty
[26:47.200 --> 26:50.920]  conservative in my approach folks we're pretty careful about what we cover here
[26:50.920 --> 26:56.640]  no matter how nuts it sounds it's all documented and then I found out I
[26:56.640 --> 27:01.880]  really started researching about 97 but I went public more and more 99 2000 Jim
[27:01.880 --> 27:07.360]  Keith's books you know I would see the newspapers he sourced I would go actually
[27:07.360 --> 27:11.120]  get them online or go to the library where they had done university studies
[27:11.120 --> 27:16.260]  that they were spraying weird white blood cells with no nuclei barium salts
[27:16.260 --> 27:23.440]  sulfur dioxide helicopters were doing it low-level larger jets were doing it
[27:23.440 --> 27:30.320]  high up there was different programs going on weather modification biological
[27:30.320 --> 27:33.680]  testing and I knew they'd done this thousands of times before it's just not
[27:33.680 --> 27:40.760]  with a huge global program and then NASA admitted in BBC what four years ago
[27:40.760 --> 27:45.120]  the earth is now 20% darker it showed the satellite photos over North America
[27:45.120 --> 27:50.640]  Europe Australia where it was nothing but spider web lines blotting out the
[27:50.640 --> 27:58.040]  Sun and there was this huge concerted program that anytime you'd mention it
[27:58.040 --> 28:01.480]  you'd be attacked suddenly you'd be attacked everywhere by blogs and
[28:01.480 --> 28:07.800]  websites and we get threats about it and we'd be called kooks well that's
[28:07.800 --> 28:11.160]  because they didn't want us talking about it it's real it's going on and Paul
[28:11.160 --> 28:17.280]  Watson has only taken open public material I think the headline should
[28:17.280 --> 28:25.520]  reel should read secret government programs spraying poisonous chemicals
[28:25.520 --> 28:29.640]  into atmosphere expose chemtrails real or something like that or shocker chem
[28:29.640 --> 28:35.480]  trails declassified government is spraying public I mean this is a
[28:35.480 --> 28:40.400]  shocker we need to try to get people's attention this is actually a toned down
[28:40.400 --> 28:46.280]  headline secret geo engineering projects threaten unknown environmental
[28:46.280 --> 28:51.400]  dangers but then Paul list where they they admit it to deadly poison to humans
[28:51.400 --> 28:57.400]  and causes environmental problems and it's admitted see we get accused of
[28:57.400 --> 29:07.400]  fear-mongering my riders actually water things down I'm not mad at them it's
[29:07.400 --> 29:10.480]  just this is this is when you read this it's all links to the government
[29:10.480 --> 29:15.360]  mainstream media admitting they're terraforming the planet right now that
[29:15.360 --> 29:18.480]  what they're spraying only one of the chemicals of hundreds they admit causes

[33:58.920 --> 34:03.800]  spraying us geo engineering since 1996 they suddenly started admitting this in
[34:03.800 --> 34:09.040]  the last few years and even I'm so blind that I didn't even do stories on it
[34:09.040 --> 34:16.360]  or cover it hidden in plain view they are engaged in a cocktail of operations

[34:35.360 --> 34:39.960]  truly think they are in total control of us and all we can do is look up and get
[34:39.960 --> 34:44.680]  mad at the madness that's what one of the people at the present planet calm
[34:44.680 --> 34:48.960]  comment section of the story said they've been doing this for about eight years
[34:48.960 --> 34:53.800]  now actually been doing it since 96 right after the sky got the Nobel Prize
[34:53.800 --> 34:57.400]  for it a few years later they launched the program and it's all in the article
[34:57.400 --> 35:01.520]  they admit it just like it's admitted there's a North American Union just like
[35:01.520 --> 35:06.240]  it's admitted they're setting up a world government it's all academic and then on
[35:06.240 --> 35:10.760]  the nightly news they say none of it exists they think the public are
[35:10.760 --> 35:16.200]  complete idiots they're playing God it's the shadow government I'm gonna cover
[35:16.200 --> 35:20.480]  this after our next guest leaves us in detail I'm gonna read this article by
[35:20.480 --> 35:26.560]  Paul Watson that is so important it is admitted they are Kim trailing us but I
[35:26.560 --> 35:31.360]  want to go to Steve Shankford the rest of the segment eFoodsDirect.com the J
[35:31.360 --> 35:35.520]  Michael Stevens group because this is where I've chosen to get my
[35:35.520 --> 35:40.440]  storable non-gmo high-quality food at a fraction of the price of grocery store
[35:40.440 --> 35:45.520]  cost food has gone up depending on which staple some of its double but on average
[35:45.520 --> 35:50.360]  30 something percent in last year and the economy I've got a stack of economic
[35:50.360 --> 35:58.040]  news here in front of me New York Times economy stays stuck as commercials and
[35:58.040 --> 36:03.400]  consumers cut back jobless rate jumps to five-year high banks borrow more from
[36:03.400 --> 36:08.880]  Fed US mortgage foreclosures then liquid sees reach record highs Bloomberg
[36:08.880 --> 36:14.280]  Cheney slams Russia over war against Georgia the US back Georgia attack them
[36:14.280 --> 36:18.480]  I mean this is the false reality we're living in I've got a Washington Times
[36:18.480 --> 36:22.000]  article admitting that Israel basically ran the attacks and the Washington Times
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.960]  is proud of it against Georgia against South Ossetia I mean point is it's
[36:26.960 --> 36:30.560]  getting crazy ladies and gentlemen I don't know what's gonna happen I don't
[36:30.560 --> 36:34.320]  know I just know you're you're nuts if you don't have some storeable food and
[36:34.320 --> 36:39.120]  and we've gone out and found the best place to get it Steve Shank thanks for
[36:39.120 --> 36:43.760]  coming on with us hey it's good to be with you again Alex things are getting
[36:43.760 --> 36:48.040]  really really nuts aren't they yeah but the mainstream media on the nightly
[36:48.040 --> 36:51.360]  news you can find it in the news wires what's happening but the nightly news
[36:51.360 --> 36:55.040]  they say things have turned around the only bad thing in the world is the
[36:55.040 --> 36:59.720]  Russian sneak attack on Georgia not true I mean it's just reached a la la land
[36:59.720 --> 37:04.800]  level well have you noticed the tremendous amount of concern that our
[37:04.800 --> 37:09.080]  candidates are showing for the fact that there's a worldwide famine and some
[37:09.080 --> 37:12.240]  Americans can't even afford to buy food now they don't even talk about the
[37:12.240 --> 37:15.760]  economy it and none of it it's all about who'll keep you safe from how kind of
[37:15.760 --> 37:21.840]  yeah isn't that the truth and you know we're we're pinching the nose of paper
[37:21.840 --> 37:27.000]  tigers all over the place and you know we're we're gagging at nats and
[37:27.000 --> 37:34.600]  swallowing camels it's absolutely insane this is Alex this is the most
[37:34.600 --> 37:41.320]  dangerous time for our people right now and let me tell you why what's
[37:41.320 --> 37:46.880]  happening is yes there are food shortages and they're very very severe you
[37:46.880 --> 37:50.520]  know you read articles all the time about how are how are they going to feed
[37:50.520 --> 37:57.280]  China India just had lost its rice crop again through flooding and that type of
[37:57.280 --> 38:03.200]  thing that the biggest nations in the world population wise but the reason I
[38:03.200 --> 38:08.480]  say it's the most dangerous time is because our people go out there Alex to
[38:08.480 --> 38:13.600]  the grocery store and they see the shelves full and let me tell you what's
[38:13.600 --> 38:18.800]  happening Walmart announced just this last a while that they didn't officially
[38:18.800 --> 38:24.400]  announce it but we found out that they have a three page list of all of the
[38:24.400 --> 38:29.120]  items all the grocery items that they used to handle that they no longer can
[38:29.120 --> 38:34.480]  get but why is it that our people go into the grocery store and they say well
[38:34.480 --> 38:38.440]  gee well the shelves are all full it's just going up in price going up in
[38:38.440 --> 38:42.000]  price going up or the reason the shelves are still full is because when they
[38:42.000 --> 38:47.400]  can't get an item they fill it in with the items that they can get and this
[38:47.400 --> 38:52.720]  creates the facade of the fact that there's plenty of food the other thing
[38:52.720 --> 38:58.680]  that's happening is our people are dealing with the food prices going up
[38:58.680 --> 39:03.840]  just like they dealt with the mortgage crisis they keep hanging on to that house
[39:03.840 --> 39:07.120]  hanging on to the house and paying out and paying out and pretty soon they're
[39:07.120 --> 39:12.720]  using their credit cards to pay their house payments and by the time that they
[39:12.720 --> 39:16.440]  get to the point where they can no longer afford it they've lost all the
[39:16.440 --> 39:20.400]  ability to choose all the flexibility that they had if they'd have gotten out
[39:20.400 --> 39:25.160]  of that stinking house way early gotten a rental that they could afford and let
[39:25.160 --> 39:30.440]  it go down what's happening with food is that people are continuing to pay higher
[39:30.440 --> 39:36.200]  and higher and higher prices and every single week Alex we have thousands of
[39:36.200 --> 39:40.920]  families that are dropping off the screen because they no longer can afford
[39:40.920 --> 39:44.600]  the groceries that are going up and up it will continue to go up well there's
[39:44.600 --> 39:49.120]  families go ahead something else to this clear channel radio was well known
[39:49.120 --> 39:53.000]  for coming into a small town there'd be two local stations for a year or two
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.120]  clear channel would sell ads for a dollar to spot when they should have been
[39:56.120 --> 40:00.280]  twenty thirty dollars a spot then that bankrupts the other two stations then
[40:00.280 --> 40:04.000]  they go to a hundred dollars a spot three or four times what it should cost in
[40:04.000 --> 40:09.200]  that small town and it's the same thing Walmart has kept prices the same they
[40:09.200 --> 40:13.400]  admittedly are running at a loss to bring people in to further destroy their
[40:13.400 --> 40:18.720]  competition this is about monopolies this is savage it's not free market oh
[40:18.720 --> 40:25.120]  absolutely and the thing is that the problem all of this smoke and
[40:25.120 --> 40:30.560]  mirrors stuff that's going on right now Alex is creating the impression that the
[40:30.560 --> 40:35.200]  only thing that's changing for our people is the prices are going up and
[40:35.200 --> 40:39.200]  he was that might come to an end sooner or later because now they've told us
[40:39.200 --> 40:43.880]  that even though we lost five million acres in the middle of the country that
[40:43.880 --> 40:48.040]  we're gonna have a bumper crop this year well if you believe that i got a lot of
[40:48.040 --> 40:54.000]  bridges to study in a lot of places the fact is that all of all of the
[40:54.000 --> 41:00.560]  apparently of prosperity is sitting there and it's draining our people and unless
[41:00.560 --> 41:05.560]  folks understand that they have to do what the speculators doing you can
[41:05.560 --> 41:10.760]  understand the reason those prices are going up is not the gas issue it's the
[41:10.760 --> 41:17.760]  speculation where investors are able to buy your food and they're investing in
[41:17.760 --> 41:23.040]  what you've got to have they have they are creating a monopoly over the food
[41:23.040 --> 41:29.160]  and and it might be wise if the speculators and investors are investing
[41:29.160 --> 41:35.480]  in our food and in our future to make a huge profit we might want to take a cue
[41:35.480 --> 41:40.720]  from them and say maybe I better invest in my own future and go go buy some food
[41:40.720 --> 41:45.480]  and put it in Steve you always get into this speculation and and and how the
[41:45.480 --> 41:49.040]  prices are going up you said this a year ago we started interviewing you on
[41:49.040 --> 41:53.320]  air I've known you for years and what you said turned out to be true regardless
[41:53.320 --> 41:57.360]  regardless let's say there's a 10% chance that food is going to double in
[41:57.360 --> 42:01.040]  price again let's say there's a 10% chance we're going to have some limited
[42:01.040 --> 42:05.040]  war with Russia or Iran let's say there's a 10% chance we're going to have
[42:05.040 --> 42:08.520]  more inflation well that's guaranteed we're having a record inflation and it's
[42:08.520 --> 42:11.520]  only intensifying and all the economists we have on say it's going to
[42:11.520 --> 42:14.640]  intensify for the next three years and there's no light at the end of the tunnel
[42:14.640 --> 42:19.200]  I let's just say though it's not guaranteed let's say there's a moderate
[42:19.200 --> 42:23.200]  chance you know I bought storeable food from you seven years ago and I still
[42:23.200 --> 42:26.280]  got it and it's great but I bought even more and then I bought family that didn't
[42:26.280 --> 42:30.920]  have up you know enough money a year's supply because that's what I do you know
[42:30.920 --> 42:34.160]  that's what's important to me is protect my family and I'm going to try to buy
[42:34.160 --> 42:37.920]  some more food from you because I know we're going into dangerous waters who
[42:37.920 --> 42:42.240]  can't say we aren't definitely in the next 10 years I mean regardless the way
[42:42.240 --> 42:46.720]  inflation is working this you can eat this stuff in five years or in a year
[42:46.720 --> 42:52.880]  and save a ton of money just in what the price of food is doing in fact you've
[42:52.880 --> 42:56.120]  got all those actual numbers I see different ones I see wheat doubling
[42:56.120 --> 43:00.800]  things like that happening overall they talk about you know 25 30% in overall
[43:00.800 --> 43:05.640]  food prices in the last year Steve what numbers do you have on inflation well the
[43:05.640 --> 43:10.360]  numbers that we have on inflation are actually false numbers the fact is is
[43:10.360 --> 43:16.040]  that we expect a doubling in those prices now what we've what we've experienced
[43:16.040 --> 43:20.640]  is that the cost of the food that's being packed into the cans for the
[43:20.640 --> 43:26.080]  families has gone up so fast in the last three months that that we're doing
[43:26.080 --> 43:30.440]  everything we can to avoid a price increase it's not gonna it's not
[43:30.440 --> 43:34.280]  talking about you and what you're selling high-quality store I know the
[43:34.280 --> 43:40.520]  upgraded foods for what I'm saying is is that is that you we see a gallon of
[43:40.520 --> 43:44.920]  milk go from literally a dollar to five dollars at the store four dollars
[43:44.920 --> 43:50.680]  absolutely we see eggs go from 50 cents to three dollars we see you know every
[43:50.680 --> 43:55.160]  major staple going way up we hear about in commodities you know wheat
[43:55.160 --> 43:59.400]  doubling I mean that's what I'm asking I'm asking you about I understand the Fed
[43:59.400 --> 44:05.040]  says inflation is at 6% and every economist says it's at 12 to 15 but
[44:05.040 --> 44:11.760]  that's overall inflation cost of living I'm asking you you about you know what
[44:11.760 --> 44:17.400]  as a bulk buyer what it's really doing okay if we make it to middle November
[44:17.400 --> 44:24.200]  without families having to pay twice as much for meat and dairy products and the
[44:24.200 --> 44:31.080]  the the produced food that that's dependent on the corn crop to survive
[44:31.080 --> 44:36.080]  if we make it to mid November without those those items doubling I will be
[44:36.080 --> 44:41.520]  extremely surprised now that's that's what's happening at the supply end of
[44:41.520 --> 44:45.560]  the food but Steve my question is and I understand that my question is what
[44:45.560 --> 44:49.200]  you're an expert on this what are you seeing on the ground how much have your
[44:49.200 --> 44:54.240]  food cost increased in the last 12 months yourself in previous purchases it's
[44:54.240 --> 45:01.240]  doubled all of the stuff all of the stuff in the last 12 months and also there
[45:01.240 --> 45:05.960]  are items that we cannot get I mean you can double it all you want to but if
[45:05.960 --> 45:08.880]  there's no food there it doesn't make any difference and what is it you can't
[45:08.880 --> 45:15.040]  get around just curious well one of the things that we're dealing with is some
[45:15.040 --> 45:20.120]  of the dairy products but mostly the dried fruits and vegetables and things
[45:20.120 --> 45:25.680]  like that are becoming extremely difficult and extremely expensive and
[45:25.680 --> 45:31.360]  the costs are going up to the point where even at the even at half of last
[45:31.360 --> 45:36.240]  year's grocery prices which is what people can put in their food now it's
[45:36.240 --> 45:41.800]  not going to happen like I say by mid November if if we're still able to put
[45:41.800 --> 45:45.480]  out units of food that people can even afford it'll be amazing well I don't
[45:45.480 --> 45:49.680]  know how you did it but six five or six months ago you said gold's going to
[45:49.680 --> 45:53.800]  stabilize for a while they said go up in the later and you said oil is going to
[45:53.800 --> 45:56.720]  go down but food's going to explode you were right about that how did you know
[45:56.720 --> 46:01.880]  that Steve well just because what we're watching is actually what's happening
[46:01.880 --> 46:07.000]  with the speculation and what we're watching is we know what suppliers are
[46:07.000 --> 46:13.920]  saying to us the farmers are not did not plant this last year and we also know
[46:13.920 --> 46:19.960]  what what our what our buyers are dealing with that is not affected by the
[46:19.960 --> 46:25.120]  gas prices all the gas price thing was pure speculation and dollar
[46:25.120 --> 46:29.360]  evaluation and but yeah the top 20% of it was speculation that's why it's gone
[46:29.360 --> 46:34.000]  down 20% and it'll go up with the food thing is the food thing is real you know
[46:34.000 --> 46:39.920]  I understand shortage and now now you're saying the speculators like locust move
[46:39.920 --> 46:44.080]  from sector to sector of commodities but now it's not just the speculators
[46:44.080 --> 46:49.560]  you're saying it's it's a real cocktail or perfect storm absolutely absolutely
[46:49.560 --> 46:53.360]  okay well the seed is going around buying up everything they get their hands
[46:53.360 --> 46:58.560]  on India's going around buying up everything they got their hands on our
[46:58.560 --> 47:02.880]  government is is trying to control those countries with food that they don't
[47:02.880 --> 47:08.320]  have their cell they're using our food to try and manipulate the Indians and the
[47:08.320 --> 47:12.760]  Chinese and the Indians and Chinese just broke off negotiations on that last
[47:12.760 --> 47:16.280]  week yeah that's like the old Soviet Union when we tried to control them with
[47:16.280 --> 47:19.520]  the grain because they're coming the system couldn't produce it now we're
[47:19.520 --> 47:23.520]  becoming that Steve we only got about four minutes left I want to tell people
[47:23.520 --> 47:27.240]  about the free audio CD you've got the brochure but I think people shouldn't
[47:27.240 --> 47:32.320]  wait you really are the lowest price for the highest quality when I did research
[47:32.320 --> 47:36.240]  seven eight years ago I went with you I've gotten food for me four times now
[47:36.240 --> 47:41.080]  I've been so busy I need to get a call in I'm like everybody else to get some
[47:41.080 --> 47:44.800]  more food because I gave even more to family but I do believe in this folks I
[47:44.800 --> 47:48.320]  think this makes you where you're not dependent in a martial law situation in
[47:48.320 --> 47:52.640]  a war situation where you don't have to go to the New Orleans style Superdome to
[47:52.640 --> 47:58.160]  be controlled it's so important to have some storable food even if you're a
[47:58.160 --> 48:03.040]  single and you get a two-month boogie pack with a little stove he's gotten a
[48:03.040 --> 48:07.280]  little you know system to heat it and and and and hundreds and hundreds of
[48:07.280 --> 48:11.400]  meals and two little boxes that fits in your trunk I mean you cannot beat that
[48:11.400 --> 48:16.560]  just start get involved I believe in it it's also a great sponsor so it's all
[48:16.560 --> 48:21.320]  a symbiotic situation tell them about the website tell them about the the
[48:21.320 --> 48:26.280]  telephone number and and and about some of the packages Steve okay sounds good
[48:26.280 --> 48:34.120]  get up on efoodsdirect.com that's efoodsdirect.com there are a whole
[48:34.120 --> 48:38.040]  bunch of articles and information there but you can see the various units of
[48:38.040 --> 48:43.760]  food the one-year supplies and also the two-month grab-and-go kit the fact is
[48:43.760 --> 48:50.120]  at Alex we don't know how long we're going to be able to put this out at this
[48:50.120 --> 48:54.480]  pricing or the availability so the main thing that people have to do is if
[48:54.480 --> 48:58.800]  they're planning to move on it move on it now because at this point they can buy
[48:58.800 --> 49:05.360]  they can buy their food at half the cost of last year's groceries this is not
[49:05.360 --> 49:09.920]  happening anyplace else because you bought in such a mass what back in
[49:09.920 --> 49:17.640]  December oh yeah well we we actually we actually bought a lot during during the
[49:17.640 --> 49:22.920]  early spring because we were telling you and your listeners that this was
[49:22.920 --> 49:26.800]  coming and we did exactly the same thing we're telling people to do the
[49:26.800 --> 49:32.040]  warehouses bought ahead while they could afford it and that's the only reason
[49:32.040 --> 49:35.680]  that these folks are able to get their pricing the way it is right now you
[49:35.680 --> 49:39.040]  really do have great pricing and we could take a lot of other storeable
[49:39.040 --> 49:42.360]  foods company sponsors we've been approached by them and I look at the
[49:42.360 --> 49:46.640]  prices the quality and we've decided to go go with you Steve because we really
[49:46.640 --> 49:49.880]  do care about our listeners and want to want to give them the best deal we can
[49:49.880 --> 49:56.560]  and bottom line folks bottom line you can get this put it away for 10 years 10
[49:56.560 --> 50:00.720]  plus in climate control 10 years in your Attica garage and not worry about it

[54:05.440 --> 54:11.200]  it's a very important story already going viral on the web US government mad
[54:11.200 --> 54:17.920]  scientist geoengineer atmosphere up on prison planet dot com and info wars dot
[54:17.920 --> 54:23.720]  com US government scientist are bombarding the skies with acid rain
[54:23.720 --> 54:28.040]  causing pollutant sulfur dioxide and attempt to find global warming by
[54:28.040 --> 54:32.080]  geoengineering the planet despite the fact that injecting aerosols in the
[54:32.080 --> 54:37.200]  upper atmosphere carry with it a host of both known and unknown dangers now
[54:37.200 --> 54:41.240]  getting hundreds of universities government agencies foreign agencies
[54:41.240 --> 54:45.720]  foreign countries involved in this and it's all admitted for six months we've
[54:45.720 --> 54:52.880]  been covering this polls now doing some stories on it this allows them to
[54:52.880 --> 54:57.600]  induct all the different research bodies at major universities into black ops
[54:57.600 --> 55:02.160]  into saving the earth into the secretness of it now they're introducing it
[55:02.160 --> 55:06.720]  high school textbooks admit two years ago that they're spraying the sky to keep
[55:06.720 --> 55:11.440]  us safe from global warming calling it sunscreen all these university textbooks
[55:11.440 --> 55:15.200]  admit it but you go to the mainstream media and they just go oh you're one of
[55:15.200 --> 55:19.960]  the nuts kind of like you hold up university documents and government
[55:19.960 --> 55:24.800]  documents that have been gotten through lawsuits and for your request about the
[55:24.800 --> 55:29.320]  North American Union calling at that saying it's secret they just laugh and
[55:29.320 --> 55:37.000]  say that doesn't exist you see it's the child likeness of the public and the
[55:37.000 --> 55:40.880]  public it's more than that it's they've been conned and lied to so much they
[55:40.880 --> 55:44.640]  don't want to admit they've been lied to they don't want to admit they've been
[55:44.640 --> 55:50.480]  conned and scammed and taken to the cleaners they don't want to come to grips
[55:50.480 --> 55:59.000]  with this and so they're gonna deny deny deny deny deny deny deny deny it's like
[55:59.000 --> 56:05.320]  that bear pharmaceutical knowingly pudding they knew the blood was all
[56:05.320 --> 56:13.560]  contaminated millions and millions of dosages of it they knew every pint they
[56:13.560 --> 56:17.280]  taken was contaminated they mixed it all together made factor a they knew it
[56:17.280 --> 56:21.560]  had hepatitis a b and c in it they knew it was a death sentence for millions that
[56:21.560 --> 56:25.880]  took it oh yeah hundreds of thousands have died hundreds of thousands of
[56:25.880 --> 56:30.440]  others are ill the hemophiliacs had sex with their wives and husbands and gave
[56:30.440 --> 56:34.480]  it to them women who were hemophiliacs that didn't know got pregnant their
[56:34.480 --> 56:39.360]  babies got it and I talk about that and people just laugh at me and send me
[56:39.360 --> 56:46.080]  threatening emails hey you little bastards it's MSNBC it's associated press I
[56:46.080 --> 56:50.280]  heard some talks of yesterday reporting on it going I don't know that Alex is
[56:50.280 --> 56:56.400]  right about this story you know who knows in Papantonio MSNBC is telling the
[56:56.400 --> 57:01.040]  truth they were indicted and arrested in France it's all admitted it came out in
[57:01.040 --> 57:04.440]  the criminal hearings in France where they did the right thing and arrested
[57:04.440 --> 57:10.000]  Bayer pharmaceutical executives in that country it's admitted it's all come out
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.480]  in court
[57:19.040 --> 57:25.240]  so that's the bottom line it's just like this when Paul has all these links to
[57:25.240 --> 57:28.120]  universities government reports they admit they're spraying the atmosphere
[57:28.120 --> 57:32.600]  they admit of the one of the hundreds of things the chemicals are spraying one
[57:32.600 --> 57:38.560]  of them is deadly poison you can give people university government documents
[57:38.560 --> 57:44.360]  there's there's literally thousands of university web pages department of
[57:44.360 --> 57:49.040]  energy web pages department of defense admitting it they are adding it to the
[57:49.040 --> 57:54.120]  jet fuel people say oh what is an American Airlines pilot part of it no
[57:54.120 --> 58:02.160]  you just control the five or six bulk jet fuel companies you go wait there's
[58:02.160 --> 58:06.000]  hundreds of companies hundreds of companies that buy from the five or six
[58:06.000 --> 58:10.480]  makers of the jet fuel kerosene mix that's what jet fuel is the type of
[58:10.480 --> 58:15.360]  kerosene and they add this crap right in there and that was in the Nobel Prize
[58:15.360 --> 58:21.680]  winners plan the elites are we like that plan because they love playing God and
[58:21.680 --> 58:25.600]  folks that's only one part the the weather manipulation as we always told
[58:25.600 --> 58:29.400]  you is only one component then there's a chemical biological radiological
[58:29.400 --> 58:33.520]  component so see the university people involved in all this they think it's
[58:33.520 --> 58:38.280]  geoengineering that's not what it's really for it attacks reproductive
[58:38.280 --> 58:40.680]  systems

[1:01:02.280 --> 1:01:08.920]  want this to go mega viral right out in plain view because we've made such a
[1:01:08.920 --> 1:01:13.640]  stink over chemtrails they're going okay we're spraying you it's for your own
[1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:18.480]  good kind of like yeah we want a North American Union then we made a big deal
[1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:21.560]  out of it they said we never said that or okay we're pulling that back they
[1:01:21.560 --> 1:01:26.560]  never pull it back when they explain to the police bureaucrats everybody they're
[1:01:26.560 --> 1:01:33.080]  spraying your family with sulfur dioxide with barium salts with glass
[1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:38.040]  crystals god you know what that does to your lungs
[1:01:38.040 --> 1:01:41.720]  US government scientist are bombarding the skies with acid rain causing
[1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:45.800]  pollutant sulfur dioxide an attempt to fight global warming by geoengineering
[1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:48.680]  the planet despite the fact that injecting aerosols in the upper
[1:01:48.680 --> 1:01:52.400]  atmosphere carries with it a host of both known and unknown dangers now
[1:01:52.400 --> 1:01:57.400]  remember it's all academically admitted and they literally laugh and say but the
[1:01:57.400 --> 1:02:06.160]  cattle will tell them it doesn't exist haha they're so stupid the proposal to
[1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:10.840]  disperse sulfur dioxide and attempt to reflect sunlight was again raised in
[1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:15.200]  London Guardian article this last week entitled geoengineering their radical
[1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:18.280]  ideas to combat global warming see they're introducing it out of the slaves
[1:02:18.280 --> 1:02:22.520]  in public articles they're proposing it in government documents they've been
[1:02:22.520 --> 1:02:28.400]  doing it since 96 see how that always kind of like they tell you oh we might
[1:02:28.400 --> 1:02:35.120]  have a national ID card we've had one since 1993 under federal law by 2000 we
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:40.800]  had a world ID standardized under UN treaty but we're just now in 2008 talking
[1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:49.920]  about the real ID national ID 12 13 years later geoengineering the radical
[1:02:49.920 --> 1:02:54.880]  ideas to combat global warming in which Ken Caldera again this is just saying
[1:02:54.880 --> 1:02:59.120]  it's all real in the earth's cooling a leading climate scientist basic Carnegie
[1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:02.960]  Institute in Stanford California see the Carnegie's it runs the whole thing it's
[1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:08.240]  the master think tank over Rockefeller over IBM over all of it promotes the
[1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:13.440]  idea of injecting the atmosphere with aerosols one approach is to insert
[1:03:13.440 --> 1:03:18.640]  scatterers into the stratosphere says the article Caldera cites an idea to
[1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:22.480]  deploy jumbo jets into the upper atmosphere and deposit clouds of tiny
[1:03:22.480 --> 1:03:27.840]  particles there such as sulfur dioxide dispersing around one at tons of
[1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:34.120]  sulfur dioxide per year 1 million tons of it a year across 10 million square
[1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:37.520]  kilometers of the atmosphere which will be enough to reflect away significant
[1:03:37.520 --> 1:03:42.280]  amounts of sunlight now Paul did a good job but he at the end of the article he
[1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:45.040]  then points you to where they admit they're already doing it I need a
[1:03:45.040 --> 1:03:49.680]  hardcore article by Steve or Kurt or somebody I'm not knocking Paul that just
[1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:53.520]  out of the gate says they're doing it it's admitted in plain view the average
[1:03:53.520 --> 1:03:58.520]  personal read this and just think it's being proposed see this show and my
[1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:02.640]  websites do not tell you how bad it is it's hard to describe how bad it is I
[1:04:02.640 --> 1:04:08.760]  can't get my guys to tell you how bad it is it's very frustrating
[1:04:08.760 --> 1:04:13.040]  experiment similar to Caldera's proposal are already being carried out so he gets
[1:04:13.040 --> 1:04:16.840]  to that by US government backed scientists such as those at the US
[1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:21.360]  Department of Energy's DOE Savannah River National Laboratory in Aiken South
[1:04:21.360 --> 1:04:24.920]  Carolina who this year conducted studies which involved shooting huge
[1:04:24.920 --> 1:04:29.520]  amounts of particle matter particulate matter into this case porous walled glass
[1:04:29.520 --> 1:04:34.480]  micro-spears into the stratosphere the project which reaches conclusion this
[1:04:34.480 --> 1:04:38.680]  past April is closely tied to the idea of Nobel Prize winner Paul Kuchin
[1:04:38.680 --> 1:04:45.840]  Kuchin who proposed sending aircraft 747s to dump huge quantities of sulfur
[1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:49.760]  particles into the far reaches of the stratosphere to cool down the atmosphere
[1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:53.880]  such programs merely scattered the surface of what is likely to be our
[1:04:53.880 --> 1:04:58.840]  gargantuan overreaching black-budget funded project the geoengineer of the
[1:04:58.840 --> 1:05:04.760]  planet will be back high fuel prices for gasoline and diesel are taking a huge

[1:06:09.240 --> 1:06:14.760]  September 11th but who is the enemy bin Laden this is his ammo we have to look
[1:06:14.760 --> 1:06:18.360]  to the Middle East we have to look to Osama bin Laden tabled enemies is the
[1:06:18.360 --> 1:06:22.200]  first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:06:22.200 --> 1:06:26.320]  networks inside the United States some U.S. investigators believe that there
[1:06:26.320 --> 1:06:32.120]  are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that
[1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:37.120]  some Israeli citizens have been detained and Laden's connections to the CIA the

[1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:45.400]  money to make this operation go forward I'm very proud of fabled enemies you
[1:09:45.400 --> 1:09:50.040]  know it hit number one on Google video and because Jason uploaded it in his
[1:09:50.040 --> 1:09:55.160]  version on his Google account Google about eight months ago started making
[1:09:55.160 --> 1:10:01.400]  their hits secret only the person that uploaded it and Google can know that well
[1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:05.000]  it had hundreds of thousands of views in one day it went to number one was
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:10.120]  number one on the second day and guess what happened Google froze it for the
[1:10:10.120 --> 1:10:16.440]  day knocked it out of the top 100 and has frozen Jason's internal counter he
[1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:20.200]  has screenshots on that we're gonna be posting an article in the next hour at
[1:10:20.200 --> 1:10:25.640]  info wars.com and prison planet.com so here I am on my own show advertising you
[1:10:25.640 --> 1:10:30.800]  can watch it for free on YouTube and Google and now we're in danger with
[1:10:30.800 --> 1:10:35.280]  these films of not even making a profit and kind of destroying ourselves in the
[1:10:35.280 --> 1:10:38.800]  process but I guess I can take advertising money and donations and
[1:10:38.800 --> 1:10:45.240]  fun-making future films. It was a really mean person sent me an email saying oh I
[1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:50.240]  see Jason's to making a lot of money he had some some dentistry done you people
[1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:55.080]  are really sick my dad's a dentist and we did that for Jason for free but the sad
[1:10:55.080 --> 1:11:00.080]  part is we deserve to be able to have our fillings filled and be able to put gas
[1:11:00.080 --> 1:11:03.920]  in our cars we're bringing a valuable service exposing the new world order and
[1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:08.040]  I want the patriot movement to stop being intimidated by the trolls and people

[1:11:15.040 --> 1:11:22.200]  shoes how dare Burmese be able to live in a $200 a month apartment he needs to

[1:13:47.880 --> 1:13:53.040]  just see what you got if you live in Austin Texas or the surrounding area
[1:13:53.040 --> 1:14:00.000]  when you got references Mike at info wars.com okay I'm done ranting I just
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:06.360]  started thinking about it now when Jason Burmese got down here he had
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:10.320]  absolutely nothing they live basically in a little shack house up in upstate
[1:14:10.320 --> 1:14:15.040]  New York he was taking care of his young niece the economy's falling apart up
[1:14:15.040 --> 1:14:19.040]  there when the guys did get some money from loose change they made hundreds of
[1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:23.040]  thousands I think he said like 300,000 copies or something for free and gave
[1:14:23.040 --> 1:14:26.800]  them away on the streets and I remember a mailing to Austin activists you know
[1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:31.160]  30,000 copies Chicago activists 50,000 copies for free and I was like you guys
[1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:35.880]  better stop that oh we're just gonna give give give and I said yeah but I said
[1:14:35.880 --> 1:14:39.920]  you got to keep something back you got to keep seed money back literally like a
[1:14:39.920 --> 1:14:45.440]  farmer they didn't listen and totally blew everything giving the films away I
[1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:48.920]  mean they really did say on the site if you're a first responder or know
[1:14:48.920 --> 1:14:52.720]  somebody that's a free video well everybody said it they were a new a
[1:14:52.720 --> 1:14:56.400]  family member or a family member a first responder so about half the videos
[1:14:56.400 --> 1:15:01.400]  they even sold were free so they went bankrupt basically and Jason's like I
[1:15:01.400 --> 1:15:05.240]  was halfway through this film please so he gets down here he has no money and
[1:15:05.240 --> 1:15:10.480]  and he does I'm just telling you see you know he gets down here he's staying in a
[1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:13.720]  $200 a month apartment with a guy who's a hippie and doesn't believe in air
[1:15:13.720 --> 1:15:19.840]  conditioning so he moved in with it with Aaron Dykes in his apartment he'd
[1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:25.200]  never had a car never had a car the guys worked in pizza places and everywhere
[1:15:25.200 --> 1:15:29.880]  else you know hard-working guy by the way his mom's got a brain tumor terminal
[1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:34.240]  brain tumor right now his dad's dead I mean let's just talk about who Jason
[1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:39.680]  Bermas is now that I'm off on this rant here because it makes me mad so we get
[1:15:39.680 --> 1:15:46.000]  him down here we buy him a $5,000 car my dad's a dentist Bermas is insecure about
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:49.560]  a big space in his teeth I think it's cool but he's whining about us so you
[1:15:49.560 --> 1:15:55.080]  know what I'll give you free braces my dad did it and we gave him $1,000 to go
[1:15:55.080 --> 1:16:00.720]  back home to get back in his car and we're bad you know what buy fabled
[1:16:00.720 --> 1:16:05.640]  enemies support Jason Bermas he deserves to be able to live decently and take
[1:16:05.640 --> 1:16:08.960]  care of his family he deserves be able to take care of his mother who's got a
[1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:15.200]  brain tumor he deserves that so I don't mean to get off on a rent like this it
[1:16:15.200 --> 1:16:22.040]  just makes me so sick that websites were created saying look he's got braces you
[1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:28.120]  people are sick we deserve to actually be comfortable so we could be honored and
[1:16:28.120 --> 1:16:32.680]  make better films and do a better job as your champions in this fight so you know
[1:16:32.680 --> 1:16:37.400]  what people try to intimidate me and calm me they've done it to my riders you
[1:16:37.400 --> 1:16:40.040]  know where they where where you can have the most incredible thing happening and
[1:16:40.040 --> 1:16:43.560]  they give it some lame headline watering it down because we're trying to be
[1:16:43.560 --> 1:16:49.880]  objective there's nothing objective about this or where those guys wanted to be
[1:16:49.880 --> 1:16:53.800]  so up so good and give everything away maybe God bless them by them coming to
[1:16:53.800 --> 1:16:58.520]  me and then I supported them but the point is is that they're giving deserves
[1:16:58.520 --> 1:17:01.960]  to be rewarded I'm gonna shut up I know Luke's been holding for five minutes six

[1:17:30.840 --> 1:17:34.120]  rush you're getting the death threats I'm getting local patriot groups trying to
[1:17:34.120 --> 1:17:38.520]  make stuff up and call cops on us it's just unbelievable and yes I'm aware of
[1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:42.400]  it you bastards you think I'm stupid but I mean at the point is we're under attack

[1:17:46.920 --> 1:17:50.640]  about the festivities coming up in New York the expose the first responders
[1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:56.280]  benefit but before we do that give me your take on what happened in Denver
[1:17:56.280 --> 1:18:01.440]  Denver was an amazing trip I really want to think we are change Colorado for
[1:18:01.440 --> 1:18:06.080]  everything they were doing out there it was amazing taken over live broadcasts of
[1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:10.520]  MSNBC it was amazing confronting politicians all over the streets of
[1:18:10.520 --> 1:18:15.880]  Denver it was amazing seeing the protests the riots the police actually
[1:18:15.880 --> 1:18:19.880]  even arresting a 12-year-old in the streets for no reason which I have video
[1:18:19.880 --> 1:18:24.560]  of it was an incredible week there documenting everything showing the
[1:18:24.560 --> 1:18:29.120]  world what was going on on live TV on Justin TV where we had our live video
[1:18:29.120 --> 1:18:34.480]  feeds showing the world exactly what's happening unedited live to protect us
[1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:38.600]  and to protect everybody make sure that nobody steps out of line and make sure
[1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:44.520]  nobody gets violent it was it was an incredible week we should have gone to
[1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:48.160]  Minnesota because things didn't go well there yeah I wish I was there in
[1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:51.840]  Minnesota my guys and we are we are change Minnesota are out there and
[1:18:51.840 --> 1:18:54.920]  they're getting pepper spray they're getting shot rubber bullets they're
[1:18:54.920 --> 1:18:58.000]  going through hell right now but they're documenting everything they have videos
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:01.960]  of everything last night they just posted videos after the rage against the
[1:19:01.960 --> 1:19:07.000]  machine concert with the police basically pepper sprayed everybody and it's
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:12.120]  incredible what's happening right now in Minneapolis and I wish I was there but
[1:19:12.120 --> 1:19:15.280]  if we can't make it but those guys are out there doing they're doing an
[1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:20.000]  excellent job and just like we took over MSNBC in Denver they're taking over MSNBC
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:30.080]  over there Minneapolis other thoughts before we go to break on Denver my main
[1:19:30.080 --> 1:19:33.360]  thing is they're doing excellent work we're there exposing everything we wish
[1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:37.000]  we had the live video feed there we don't I'm not there you're not there but
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:39.720]  those guys are getting excellent video of everything that's going on there
[1:19:39.720 --> 1:19:42.520]  they're gonna be releasing it on YouTube showing the world everything that's
[1:19:42.520 --> 1:19:47.160]  going on and it's sad that the police state has expanded all the way in
[1:19:47.160 --> 1:19:49.880]  Minneapolis and they're doing these horrible things to all the activists
[1:19:49.880 --> 1:19:53.240]  Amy Goodman got arrested for no reason people are getting threatened with
[1:19:53.240 --> 1:19:56.440]  arrest for no reason they're charging them with terrorism stay there Luke

[1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:27.240]  probably a hoax so I'm not gonna say the person's name it's going around the
[1:24:27.240 --> 1:24:32.240]  web that a well-known 9-11 truth person committed suicide arkansas now we know
[1:24:32.240 --> 1:24:35.960]  they have killed some wives of firefighters and others that saw bombs
[1:24:35.960 --> 1:24:43.440]  they've killed some wives of supposed pilots so there has been a lot of wet
[1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:47.680]  work going on around 9-11 we with that we have confirmed that one 9-11 truth
[1:24:47.680 --> 1:24:51.720]  first responded reportedly committed suicide it's not the person the
[1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:55.680]  rumors going around we're trying to track that down later in the show of its
[1:24:55.680 --> 1:24:59.800]  true or not true we'll tell you about it but we got to be careful because if we
[1:24:59.800 --> 1:25:03.520]  even report that we believe it's a hoax people will edit the audio of the show
[1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:07.880]  to where I'm saying it there's a lot of dirty tricks going on right now to be
[1:25:07.880 --> 1:25:11.360]  aware of that you know we're over the target folks we're getting all the
[1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:21.760]  flak okay going back to Luke Radowski we are change Luke they have charged eight
[1:25:21.760 --> 1:25:25.280]  people who were not even involved in overturning trash cans and park benches
[1:25:25.280 --> 1:25:30.960]  with terrorism this is the same wall they tried to pass at the state level in
[1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:38.400]  Rhode Island and in Oregon a few years ago now four years ago three years ago
[1:25:38.400 --> 1:25:45.160]  respectively four years ago Oregon three years ago Rhode Island maybe five and
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:50.000]  four times flies but the point is this is really a dangerous new precedent we
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:54.520]  will just now are reviewing the video from the MSNBC demonstration we had
[1:25:54.520 --> 1:26:00.520]  where the MSNBC employees are punching me breaking my bullhorn attacking me and
[1:26:00.520 --> 1:26:04.200]  attacking my cameraman and I mean viciously they broke it that's going to
[1:26:04.200 --> 1:26:11.280]  be going up in the next few hours at info wars.com Minnesota change has got
[1:26:11.280 --> 1:26:16.040]  incredible footage of the police rioting they attack the peaceful crowd then the
[1:26:16.040 --> 1:26:20.040]  crowd fights back and are called terrorist this is this country's gone
[1:26:20.040 --> 1:26:27.440]  Luke I mean even when we were in Denver taking over MSNBC when I was on the
[1:26:27.440 --> 1:26:31.800]  law show there on his bullhorn on his shoulders there are people who are
[1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:34.800]  trying to throw me off of his shoulders and trying to throw me down to the
[1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:38.520]  floor people hitting me with signs trying to take me down and it was just
[1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:42.000]  an incredible experience but we persevered even though they broke your
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  bullhorn as soon as we found that out we brought two of them down there we
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:48.280]  brought down a whole team we brought down everybody and they couldn't do
[1:26:48.280 --> 1:26:51.560]  anything about it we took back the broadcast we let the whole world know
[1:26:51.560 --> 1:26:55.320]  about not 11 truth and that's what that's what it's about about a
[1:26:55.320 --> 1:26:59.240]  peaceful revolution taking things over peacefully by the way we completely
[1:26:59.240 --> 1:27:03.000]  took it over people say oh that's so that's so aggressive yeah we have a
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:06.560]  terrorist government that ignores the Bill of Rights and the people's will on
[1:27:06.560 --> 1:27:12.560]  every issue is completely rogue and you better believe we're doing a shadow of
[1:27:12.560 --> 1:27:18.040]  what our founding fathers did a shadow if we're being attacked all over the
[1:27:18.040 --> 1:27:21.200]  place we're over the target we're getting all the flak we're getting
[1:27:21.200 --> 1:27:24.640]  death threats we're getting harassed because they're scared people are gonna
[1:27:24.640 --> 1:27:28.960]  emulate what we're doing folks because we've got something that wins we've got
[1:27:28.960 --> 1:27:32.800]  something that motivates and has woken up millions of people it's called action
[1:27:32.800 --> 1:27:37.520]  and passion and truth and a belief in God and a commitment to liberty we are
[1:27:37.520 --> 1:27:42.520]  unstoppable if we simply take action Luke that's why the attacks have
[1:27:42.520 --> 1:27:46.320]  intensified a hundred fold and that and I just praise God for that and I mean
[1:27:46.320 --> 1:27:50.360]  that when I say it because that lets me know that I am fighting the beast toe to
[1:27:50.360 --> 1:27:54.360]  toe it shows us that we're right we're on the right path we're doing the right
[1:27:54.360 --> 1:27:57.520]  thing we're standing up for truth and love and nothing can stop us it's a
[1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:01.600]  peaceful revolution we're taking things back slowly people are not even watching
[1:28:01.600 --> 1:28:05.120]  the news or buying newspapers anymore they're going on the internet they're
[1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:08.440]  going on info wars they're going on we are changed are getting educated they're
[1:28:08.440 --> 1:28:11.640]  passing the videos along and they're not and they're finding out what's going on
[1:28:11.640 --> 1:28:15.680]  right now as we speak people are getting educated and are waking up to this huge
[1:28:15.680 --> 1:28:19.400]  lie that we're all living in and that's what's beautiful and even though we're
[1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:22.720]  getting a lot of flak even though we're getting a lot of trouble it's all worth
[1:28:22.720 --> 1:28:26.360]  it for everybody to wake up so we can make everybody safer so we can make
[1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:30.520]  everybody aware of the situation I remember sitting about I agree I'm
[1:28:30.520 --> 1:28:32.800]  gonna hold you over look to talk about the events in New York but I remember
[1:28:32.800 --> 1:28:38.120]  sitting in in Sunday school when I was you know 8 9 10 11 12 years old I'm
[1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:42.360]  thinking a blessing to be persecuted what is this talking about a blessing to be
[1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:45.760]  thrown in jail for no reason a blessing to be to be physically attacked a
[1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:49.240]  blessing to be killed but now I know it's because you're doing good you're
[1:28:49.240 --> 1:28:53.840]  fighting evil you're protecting the weak and the meek you are standing up against
[1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:57.840]  tyranny and you're having an effect and it's what we're designed to do in this
[1:28:57.840 --> 1:29:02.680]  one life we have that is a test and to be in the right to know you that you're
[1:29:02.680 --> 1:29:06.500]  not in some false right or you're not in some yet because the globalist are
[1:29:06.500 --> 1:29:09.720]  experts at manipulating people into thinking they're doing good I know
[1:29:09.720 --> 1:29:13.920]  historically intellectually spiritually in my gut in the seat of my
[1:29:13.920 --> 1:29:19.320]  intellect that I'm not perfect lucradowski and perfect none of us are but we
[1:29:19.320 --> 1:29:23.960]  are making history and we are standing up against evil and we are having a great
[1:29:23.960 --> 1:29:28.080]  effect and that's why we know persecution is good because you don't get
[1:29:28.080 --> 1:29:31.320]  persecuted if you're not doing good ladies and gentlemen you don't have the
[1:29:31.320 --> 1:29:35.320]  enemy come against you if you're not hurting them badly and I want to hurt
[1:29:35.320 --> 1:29:39.960]  them I want to expose them I want to discredit them I want to bring them down
[1:29:39.960 --> 1:29:43.920]  so they can't continue to hurt the people from the high places and you better
[1:29:43.920 --> 1:29:47.120]  believe it's spiritual ladies and gentlemen you better believe it's good
[1:29:47.120 --> 1:29:52.960]  against evil so they're right back with lucradowski we're on the march the
[1:29:52.960 --> 1:30:02.800]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network a day unlike any other

[1:35:18.520 --> 1:35:22.080]  out immediately when I was in Denver actually found out one of my friends
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:26.400]  passed away Greg Quabell he left four kids behind he was a federal marshal not
[1:35:26.400 --> 1:35:30.760]  11th first responder he passed away due to leukemia the time is now we need all
[1:35:30.760 --> 1:35:34.040]  the help you could get to help out the sick and dying not 11 heroes and that's
[1:35:34.040 --> 1:35:37.480]  what we're gonna be doing in New York City all you know we just had a
[1:35:37.480 --> 1:35:42.440]  survivor who saw explosions in the basement commit suicide and it's up to us
[1:35:42.440 --> 1:35:47.200]  to be out there at ground zero this not 11 to show the whole world that the truth
[1:35:47.200 --> 1:35:51.000]  will not stop that we're gonna be out there we will not be silent and we will
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:54.440]  talk about the truth and we will let everybody know the truth behind not 11
[1:35:54.440 --> 1:35:58.280]  let me go ahead and call Aaron in here Aaron you you've got now now there's
[1:35:58.280 --> 1:36:03.200]  was a hoax about one first responder dying there's another one who according
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:10.040]  to their own family did commit suicide but are you sure about that look there's
[1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:14.680]  one first responder that it's in the daily news right now that passed away
[1:36:14.680 --> 1:36:19.320]  his name was on which is what's called looking on internet right now nowhere
[1:36:19.320 --> 1:36:24.320]  where my guy is hey come on in here Aaron he just went outside he has the
[1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:30.040]  article he was come on in with the first responder story that's in the daily
[1:36:30.040 --> 1:36:33.880]  news can I have that and then you're about to be on air with the eugenics
[1:36:33.880 --> 1:36:38.760]  story you're on in two minutes go ahead look we know Kenny John Mann who
[1:36:38.760 --> 1:36:42.800]  witnessed the explosions in the basement thought apparently committed suicide is
[1:36:42.800 --> 1:36:46.400]  reported in the daily news right now we need to be out there we need to support
[1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:49.920]  all the first responders all the heroes of not 11 and I'm asking people if they
[1:36:49.920 --> 1:36:54.000]  could bring down candles down to not 11 this year down the ground zero so we
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:57.680]  could light them in memory of all the ones lost of not 11 we're gonna have a
[1:36:57.680 --> 1:37:00.680]  peaceful vigil there we're gonna let the world know that we're standing up for
[1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:04.640]  truth and justice and that we will never stop until there's enough help for the
[1:37:04.640 --> 1:37:08.000]  first responders until there's enough answers for the family members and that's
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:11.920]  what it's about being out there standing strong the website is 2008 now
[1:37:11.920 --> 1:37:15.400]  we're never dot com we're doing three days of events we don't have a lot of
[1:37:15.400 --> 1:37:18.960]  money we're doing everything we can to make sure this happens without a hitch
[1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:22.480]  and we're doing anything everything in our possibilities to make sure we put on
[1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:26.000]  a great show for everybody now look you always run to the problem of not
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.800]  having enough money for the venues but you make it happen because you give
[1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:34.440]  every dime to the first responders you have to hold some back so that you can
[1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:39.640]  do further events look right now our main concern is helping the lives of
[1:37:39.640 --> 1:37:43.440]  these heroes again brookabelle just passed away because of leukemia a couple
[1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:48.240]  days ago and it's it's extremely sad that this is happening and we right now
[1:37:48.240 --> 1:37:51.480]  we don't take a single red set because these people needed more it's life or
[1:37:51.480 --> 1:37:54.640]  death for these guys and that's why we're donating that and we were just
[1:37:54.640 --> 1:37:58.640]  asking for the movement support in coming to New York City and donating to us
[1:37:58.640 --> 1:38:02.320]  and helping us save the lives of these heroes because if the government won't
[1:38:02.320 --> 1:38:06.120]  do it we will do it we are here we are change we will take care of the
[1:38:06.120 --> 1:38:10.160]  situation and we're doing everything we can best way as we can to help out these
[1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:13.920]  heroes we're asking people to donate off to number 11 to first responders donate
[1:38:13.920 --> 1:38:17.240]  to we are change will give all the money to the first responders it's about
[1:38:17.240 --> 1:38:21.800]  helping those in need and that's what we're about but how are you gonna pay
[1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:27.080]  for the venues then people are even putting up their own money I'm putting
[1:38:27.080 --> 1:38:31.640]  up my own money and we're making anything happen we're literally we don't
[1:38:31.640 --> 1:38:34.680]  have any we don't have a lot of money but we're making things I know that look
[1:38:34.680 --> 1:38:38.840]  I actually know the behind-the-scenes stuff of you guys have to at least pay
[1:38:38.840 --> 1:38:42.040]  for the venue though out of the ticket sales and then give the rest so there's
[1:38:42.040 --> 1:38:45.960]  not always this crisis of selling people's cars and things to pay for the
[1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:49.720]  venues I know you guys have raised what is it total for first responders for the
[1:38:49.720 --> 1:38:54.120]  feel-good foundation and others what do you mean in total I mean in all the other
[1:38:54.120 --> 1:38:57.680]  events you guys have raised quite a bit well throughout the years we raised
[1:38:57.680 --> 1:39:01.840]  about forty to fifty thousand dollars for first responders and all the money
[1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:05.240]  we got from this move will go straight to them well you've done a great job and
[1:39:05.240 --> 1:39:11.360]  Luke and you know at the same time you know I flew up there on my own dime you
[1:39:11.360 --> 1:39:15.760]  had the premiere we gave all that money all of it to the fight just like you
[1:39:15.760 --> 1:39:19.800]  guys are doing I'm just you know really want you guys to make sure that you
[1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:26.000]  personally don't go too deep into Hawk I know the example of the feel-good
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:30.440]  foundation John feel you know gave his own kidney you also had a big beam crush
[1:39:30.440 --> 1:39:35.240]  his foot in the debris but he gave his own kidney to a NYPD officer and he's a
[1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:41.120]  firefighter so that's all covered in truth rising I mean these are
[1:39:41.120 --> 1:39:45.520]  incredible people and what a lot of truth rising you could also hear the
[1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:50.560]  story of Greg Quabell who recently passed away the family said he was a
[1:39:50.560 --> 1:39:54.720]  fat he was a police officer a federal investigator and he'll tell you it's an
[1:39:54.720 --> 1:39:59.480]  inside job from the grave in the film and he was there we covered it and it's
[1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:03.160]  at the end of truth rising where they're there at a press conference just
[1:40:03.160 --> 1:40:05.920]  asking for health care his lungs were filled with the deadly poisons and
[1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:10.760]  toxins and the feds told him no no no money for treatment for you and we've
[1:40:10.760 --> 1:40:15.600]  had over what two thousand die now thousands more dying and we will be
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:19.080]  spit on by police for trying to save them that's that's their that's their
[1:40:19.080 --> 1:40:23.000]  imperial conditioning they love to die for their masters but that's those that
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:26.560]  are under mind control a lot of the police officers thank us and appreciate
[1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:30.560]  us for what we're doing remember the government lied to you about the
[1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:34.480]  poison dust because in the words of Henry Kissinger the police and military
[1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:39.160]  are dumb animals to be used as canner cannon fodder the federal government
[1:40:39.160 --> 1:40:42.280]  lied to these not 11 heroes the federal government is now denying them the
[1:40:42.280 --> 1:40:45.840]  proper help that they need and they're ignoring these heroes we are not
[1:40:45.840 --> 1:40:49.520]  ignoring these heroes we're going to do everything possible in our hands right
[1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:53.600]  now even if it means risking our own in the money financial situations to help
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:56.720]  these guys we're going to do it because we care we are change we're going to do
[1:40:56.720 --> 1:41:00.360]  anything possible to help these guys out we have a heart and that's what we're
[1:41:00.360 --> 1:41:04.120]  showing to everybody and that's something nobody can attack nobody can talk
[1:41:04.120 --> 1:41:08.480]  that about because this is what life's about helping others actually do the
[1:41:08.480 --> 1:41:13.880]  trolls go on the we are change website in the info wars website and they do go
[1:41:13.880 --> 1:41:17.360]  in the videos about that first responders and make fun of them and yeah
[1:41:17.360 --> 1:41:21.520]  you dumb cop with the 9-11 truthers you deserve to die yeah you firefighter
[1:41:21.520 --> 1:41:26.080]  scum who thought it was an inside job I'm glad you're dead I mean these are the
[1:41:26.080 --> 1:41:30.640]  sickest filth on earth yeah John Field gets harassing phone calls in the
[1:41:30.640 --> 1:41:35.000]  middle of the night from a lot from a lot of people harassing him because he's
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:38.280]  involved with you know what we are changing guaranteeing it's a federal cop
[1:41:38.280 --> 1:41:41.640]  calling up to a firefighter that gave his kidney to a cop they hate it because
[1:41:41.640 --> 1:41:46.760]  it makes them look bad these cowardly people that do as they as they will do
[1:41:46.760 --> 1:41:50.760]  as they will to serve themselves it upsets them in their core to see John
[1:41:50.760 --> 1:41:54.960]  Field give a kidney it is about standing courageously doing everything we can
[1:41:54.960 --> 1:41:58.600]  helping those in need that proves us right and is right and that's what
[1:41:58.600 --> 1:42:01.760]  life's about we have a short time in this world and it's about it's a huge
[1:42:01.760 --> 1:42:04.520]  attack and it's about doing the right thing and that's all we're trying to
[1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:07.360]  do and we're asking this movement for help because we need it and we need
[1:42:07.360 --> 1:42:11.240]  volunteers we need to help we need donations and anything possible we're
[1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:15.320]  here and we're gonna do it they're gonna pour in right now and I have to tell you
[1:42:15.320 --> 1:42:19.040]  Lucas so selfless folks they don't don't even keep the money for their own
[1:42:19.040 --> 1:42:23.800]  cameras I've bought them cameras when they get smashed and stolen and I've
[1:42:23.800 --> 1:42:27.160]  donated quite a few I guess five cameras I needed my listeners have donated a
[1:42:27.160 --> 1:42:30.880]  bunch of other cameras they really are in the front lines of the fight they
[1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:34.920]  deserve your help and they need some seed money to help pay for the venues
[1:42:34.920 --> 1:42:38.360]  and that's coming up next week learn all the details that we are changed out
[1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:44.560]  org will they be able to buy tickets at the events the premier up in New York of
[1:42:44.560 --> 1:42:49.880]  fabled enemies and frith rising or at the other big events at the door if
[1:42:49.880 --> 1:42:53.640]  people don't have internet Luke yeah of course we're gonna be selling tickets at
[1:42:53.640 --> 1:42:57.400]  the door for all events we could buy tickets right now at the website 2008
[1:42:57.400 --> 1:43:01.640]  now never.com and people could go out there and and get tickets anyway they
[1:43:01.640 --> 1:43:07.720]  can 2008 now or never.com or link through it we are change.org okay Luke I
[1:43:07.720 --> 1:43:11.360]  want you to pop in again with me next week as we build towards this event and
[1:43:11.360 --> 1:43:15.320]  just God bless you my friend it was great seeing you in Denver. Thanks for
[1:43:15.320 --> 1:43:18.920]  having me brother really appreciate it. You bet absolutely Luke we appreciate you
[1:43:18.920 --> 1:43:24.080]  you can hear me there on air spanking Luke a bit because I watched the loose
[1:43:24.080 --> 1:43:28.360]  change guys give all their seed money away in free DVDs until they were
[1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:35.600]  bankrupt and you know it's kind of like a fisherman going out and needing
[1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:39.640]  fish bait and cutting their fingers off to put it on the line just go dig for
[1:43:39.640 --> 1:43:46.440]  worms folks but that's how good these guys are is that they they just
[1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:52.960]  literally give it all back a hundred percent and I've done the same thing in
[1:43:52.960 --> 1:43:56.560]  two trips to New York and two benefits I've done but I can do that we have a
[1:43:56.560 --> 1:44:00.720]  little bit of capital reserves technically we I guess we really don't
[1:44:00.720 --> 1:44:05.000]  I'd be a better steward if I did end up coming paying for the trip because then
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:07.800]  I can put it into bigger and better things but my point is they are not
[1:44:07.800 --> 1:44:11.280]  in a position to do that and so they do need some capital to make sure they can
[1:44:11.280 --> 1:44:16.160]  pay for these events okay we are change.org folks okay I want to bring
[1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:20.360]  Aaron Dykes up for the rest of this hour because we're going into in a full
[1:44:20.360 --> 1:44:26.760]  hour with Dr. Stan Monteef the medical doctor on the history of eugenics the
[1:44:26.760 --> 1:44:31.440]  mindset of the New World Order what makes them tick but I want you to
[1:44:31.440 --> 1:44:34.320]  understand the chemtrails the aerial spraying which the government admits
[1:44:34.320 --> 1:44:38.800]  they're doing now with deadly poisons the mercury in the vaccines the cancer
[1:44:38.800 --> 1:44:44.000]  viruses in the vaccines causing cancer causing diabetes it's it's it all
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:48.160]  admitted there's no debating it this is all eugenics there's three kinds of
[1:44:48.160 --> 1:44:53.080]  eugenics there's positive eugenics negative eugenics this is their terms
[1:44:53.080 --> 1:44:58.680]  you can go study those two types and then there's the true or higher eugenics the
[1:44:58.680 --> 1:45:06.760]  masterplan eugenics the one that's in academic PhD level intercollegiate
[1:45:06.760 --> 1:45:11.240]  intramural think tank level and we've got them all folks I mean you go down
[1:45:11.240 --> 1:45:16.440]  this rabbit hole it is horrifying but haven't all mad scientists their history
[1:45:16.440 --> 1:45:22.280]  enjoyed killing enjoyed testing enjoyed playing God you know when an HG Wells or
[1:45:22.280 --> 1:45:27.880]  somebody writes a book or a Jules Verne's writes a book about you know the
[1:45:27.880 --> 1:45:32.760]  island of Dr. Moreau and half human half chimpanzee creatures that's been
[1:45:32.760 --> 1:45:37.960]  declassified for ten years okay this this is all going on cloned beef is on
[1:45:37.960 --> 1:45:43.760]  your shelves cloned hogs or pork cloned chickens now they've got cloned dogs
[1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:47.520]  hundreds of them breeding into the main breed admitting they've got new DNA and
[1:45:47.520 --> 1:45:53.360]  new makeup that's mutating I mean this is very dangerous I had top scientist on
[1:45:53.360 --> 1:45:59.400]  I've had top scientist on repeatedly where they admit the guinea pigs and the
[1:45:59.400 --> 1:46:03.680]  rats all die when they feed them these GMO this is back in the 80s and 90s when
[1:46:03.680 --> 1:46:07.440]  they would change one gene yeah it would it would make a potato last longer but
[1:46:07.440 --> 1:46:11.520]  it would also change randomly thousands of other expressions new amino acids
[1:46:11.520 --> 1:46:15.680]  there's more than 54 now you didn't know that again your body has never been
[1:46:15.680 --> 1:46:20.000]  designed to absorb that it's toxic it's causing and then they have syndromes
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:24.800]  cover syndromes like AIDS for all the problems this causes cover syndromes
[1:46:24.800 --> 1:46:31.400]  like Crohn's that went from nobody having it in 1950 to now one in 200 see
[1:46:31.400 --> 1:46:36.920]  it's just spreading one in a thousand back in the 30s having diabetes now one
[1:46:36.920 --> 1:46:42.680]  in five depending on the racial group one in three and then thousands of
[1:46:42.680 --> 1:46:48.240]  studies in the 60s 70s 80s 90s medical journals British medical journal the
[1:46:48.240 --> 1:46:55.640]  most prestigious that it fries your pancreas this is all by design Bayer
[1:46:55.640 --> 1:47:00.600]  pharmaceutical and I only use this because it's one of the few things that
[1:47:00.600 --> 1:47:04.800]  actually got national attention all the other stuff's admitted millions of
[1:47:04.800 --> 1:47:08.920]  ampoules of factor eight that gave every person HIV and hepatitis and killed
[1:47:08.920 --> 1:47:12.720]  them and they knew it for a decade and shipped it out the media says oh they
[1:47:12.720 --> 1:47:17.880]  just wanted profits bowl Bayer were the top Nazis IBM were the top Nazis
[1:47:17.880 --> 1:47:24.960]  they want to kill you I want to bring up until the eight after now Aaron Dykes
[1:47:24.960 --> 1:47:28.680]  Aaron go over some of those quotes for people I said we cover yesterday yeah
[1:47:28.680 --> 1:47:31.480]  I've got a bunch of quotes in front of me but the point I wanted to make first
[1:47:31.480 --> 1:47:35.600]  was basically what you're outlining there that while the potential benefits of
[1:47:35.600 --> 1:47:40.040]  eugenics sounds nice it has this appeal of the promise of being more mentally
[1:47:40.040 --> 1:47:45.640]  fit and physically together these systems always turn to psychopathic
[1:47:45.640 --> 1:47:49.300]  maniacs and you see this with the Nazi system but you also see it with the
[1:47:49.300 --> 1:47:53.640]  stage terror we have today in the US you know first there's a 9-11 attacks which
[1:47:53.640 --> 1:47:56.800]  seem legitimate they're not and then all of a sudden these people are talking
[1:47:56.800 --> 1:47:59.960]  about we need another attack to keep this thing going we need another attack
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:04.040]  and I've personally heard environment right out in the open yeah I've
[1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:07.760]  personally heard environmentalists on the streets low-level college students
[1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:11.440]  talking about the same thing how they believe we need another yeah you go out
[1:48:11.440 --> 1:48:13.880]  for drinks with friends and then girlfriends come over and they're
[1:48:13.880 --> 1:48:17.000]  talking about everyone must die it's gonna be beautiful what we really need
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:21.400]  is a crisis to get this environmental thing moving it's this Eric Pionka as
[1:48:21.400 --> 1:48:24.240]  talk they're creating the genetic engineering crisis and then they'll
[1:48:24.240 --> 1:48:27.080]  grandstand out of that these little bastards I'm telling you these things
[1:48:27.080 --> 1:48:31.200]  get out of control Galton himself in his own writings was mainly a quote
[1:48:31.200 --> 1:48:36.160]  positive eugenics guy he wanted the the high-bred high society people to
[1:48:36.160 --> 1:48:41.280]  maintain their luster but his first protégé H.G. Wells got out of control he
[1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:46.280]  wanted everyone who is unfit mentally or physically to be isolated and if they
[1:48:46.280 --> 1:48:52.080]  tried to breed to quote kill him and it just goes to show in Beatrice Webb was
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:56.720]  initially supporting Lenin so was H.G. Wells so was George Bernard Shaw to some
[1:48:56.720 --> 1:49:01.320]  extent all those Fabian socialists they were supporting that Lenin communist
[1:49:01.320 --> 1:49:04.760]  system and then it got out of control well did they see that coming I don't
[1:49:04.760 --> 1:49:09.280]  know but it always leads to this term this tyranny so I'm gonna read just a
[1:49:09.280 --> 1:49:12.800]  bunch of quotes and it's the worst most horrible control freak you can imagine
[1:49:12.800 --> 1:49:17.960]  with total control they just bloodbath folks these are literally people who are
[1:49:17.960 --> 1:49:21.760]  elites who consider themselves to be elites and who are literally seeking
[1:49:21.760 --> 1:49:26.200]  godlike powers a lot of them in those words and they're also seeking total
[1:49:26.200 --> 1:49:29.680]  social control and you can see this is never gonna be good and they're all
[1:49:29.680 --> 1:49:34.920]  obsessive compulsive perverts at best it's only good for the elite I mean you
[1:49:34.920 --> 1:49:38.000]  read about them they're all obsessive compulsive perverts crapping on
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:43.120]  themselves drinking bloods raping children I mean this is sick filth so
[1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:46.880]  yeah it starts with the idea of improving mankind but you can see par for
[1:49:46.880 --> 1:49:50.080]  the course there's always going to be some of these academics who get out of
[1:49:50.080 --> 1:49:54.400]  control and they're basically psychopathic maniacs waiting to happen
[1:49:54.400 --> 1:49:57.920]  Skinner murdering his own son being praised for it torturing the death of a
[1:49:57.920 --> 1:50:02.080]  box over several years yeah they're like the strength the beauty of murdering
[1:50:02.080 --> 1:50:06.640]  your own son oh my god it's so beautiful so yeah that's what I have to say about
[1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:11.160]  eugenics not only is it a flawed idea but it's we've already seen the excesses
[1:50:11.160 --> 1:50:15.840]  that can go to and Hitler it he may be the most extreme that's actually carried
[1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:19.400]  it out but you know I have congressional testimony of people talking
[1:50:19.400 --> 1:50:24.480]  about biological warfare and we have PNAC documents talking about biological
[1:50:24.480 --> 1:50:27.920]  warfare ethnic cleansing and genocide and I didn't know the Austin American
[1:50:27.920 --> 1:50:32.680]  statesmen even reported back in 2004 I guess that they picked up it up for me
[1:50:32.680 --> 1:50:36.720]  that PNAC wants to use race-specific bio weapons to kill certain races I'm
[1:50:36.720 --> 1:50:40.000]  gonna have you ride shotguns some with Monty let's come back and start just

[1:54:38.320 --> 1:54:43.160]  happening but it's all there okay Aaron let's start going into quotes here
[1:54:43.160 --> 1:54:48.600]  all right first a couple older quotes pre Thomas Malthus one is theogynous of
[1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:54.920]  Megara I'm sure I'm not pronouncing that right 520 BC ram ass and horse my
[1:54:54.920 --> 1:54:58.840]  care knows we look over with care and seek good stock for good to cover and
[1:54:58.840 --> 1:55:04.200]  yet the best man make no argument but wed for money runs of poor descent so to a
[1:55:04.200 --> 1:55:08.520]  woman will demean her state and spurn the better for the richer mate money's
[1:55:08.520 --> 1:55:14.760]  the cry good stock to bad is wed and bad to good tell the world's crossbred no
[1:55:14.760 --> 1:55:18.600]  wonder if the country's breed declines mixed metal care knows that but dimly
[1:55:18.600 --> 1:55:27.200]  shines early eugenics there William Penn 1693 men and generally more sorry men
[1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:31.080]  are generally more careful of the breed of their horses and dogs than of their
[1:55:31.080 --> 1:55:35.760]  children you hear that quote a lot and now Thomas Malthus it does not seem
[1:55:35.760 --> 1:55:39.960]  however impossible that by an attention to breed a certain degree of
[1:55:39.960 --> 1:55:43.920]  improvement similar to that among animals might take place among men
[1:55:43.920 --> 1:55:47.320]  whether intellect could be communicated may be a matter of doubt but
[1:55:47.320 --> 1:55:52.640]  size strength beauty complexion and perhaps even longevity are in a degree
[1:55:52.640 --> 1:55:56.280]  transmissible as the human race could not be improved in this way without
[1:55:56.280 --> 1:56:00.600]  condemning all the bad specimens to celibacy is not probable that an
[1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:04.480]  attention to breed should ever become general which would not be true when
[1:56:04.480 --> 1:56:10.000]  eugenics rose to popularity at the turn of the 20th century Francis Galton who
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:15.560]  coined the term eugenics in 1883 eugenics is the study of the agencies under
[1:56:15.560 --> 1:56:19.880]  social control that may improve or impair the racial qualities of future
[1:56:19.880 --> 1:56:24.040]  generations either physically or mentally what nature does blindly slowly and
[1:56:24.040 --> 1:56:29.160]  ruthlessly Galton says man may do prevent providentially quickly and
[1:56:29.160 --> 1:56:33.640]  kindly as it lies within his power so it becomes his duty to work in that
[1:56:33.640 --> 1:56:39.280]  direction now now see they simplify all this but they found that it isn't
[1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:43.840]  necessarily the look of somebody that's associated with their intelligence it
[1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:47.000]  isn't supposedly the color of someone that's associated with their
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:53.360]  intelligence so again you have this basic two and a half thousand year old
[1:56:53.360 --> 1:56:59.080]  theory that's carried right through Greece Rome the Byzantine right in the
[1:56:59.080 --> 1:57:02.800]  Middle Ages the Dark Ages the Renaissance right up into the Industrial
[1:57:02.800 --> 1:57:07.720]  Revolution where it is adopted but see so when you hear royalty six hundred
[1:57:07.720 --> 1:57:11.040]  seven hundred years ago talking about controlling the peasants breeding them
[1:57:11.040 --> 1:57:15.600]  out dumbing them down they eugenics already existed in fact it's a Greek
[1:57:15.600 --> 1:57:22.640]  word and meaning eternal youth and so this is the the basic fraud that now
[1:57:22.640 --> 1:57:26.880]  everything is based and built on and it's the excuse and rationale to kill and
[1:57:26.880 --> 1:57:31.560]  dumb down and poison whoever you want but now they have the the auspices of
[1:57:31.560 --> 1:57:35.000]  science behind it although it's completely they haven't figured it all out
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:38.840]  yet it's clear and it was really good to stack a new science on top of the basic
[1:57:38.840 --> 1:57:43.440]  mission go up yeah so here's one from John Maynard Keynes the big you know
[1:57:43.440 --> 1:57:47.280]  American socialists who put us on you know the fiat world currency and
[1:57:47.280 --> 1:57:50.640]  everything and it just shows the social control that they're after
[1:57:50.640 --> 1:57:55.680]  Galton's a centric skeptical observing flashing Calvary leader type of mind let
[1:57:55.680 --> 1:58:00.360]  him eventually to become the founder of the most important significant and I
[1:58:00.360 --> 1:58:05.640]  would add genuine branch of sociology which exists namely eugenics John Maynard
[1:58:05.640 --> 1:58:10.680]  Keynes 1946 so see it's the dominant it's the zeitgeist it's everything it's all
[1:58:10.680 --> 1:58:14.480]  they talk about at cocktail parties yeah and you'll see a quote from Theodore
[1:58:14.480 --> 1:58:18.120]  Roosevelt in a few minutes here yeah we'll be back in 70 seconds take us out
[1:58:18.120 --> 1:58:21.720]  with another quote natural selection must be replaced by eugenical
[1:58:21.720 --> 1:58:26.480]  artificial selection this idea constitutes the sound core of eugenics the
[1:58:26.480 --> 1:58:31.280]  applied science of human betterment theodosus doves on ski heredity of
[1:58:31.280 --> 1:58:38.800]  nature man 1964 now again all of your modern sciences grew out of this it
[1:58:38.800 --> 1:58:41.720]  rules
[1:58:42.160 --> 1:58:50.600]  you are listening to GCN visit GCN live com today
[1:58:50.880 --> 1:58:55.840]  today unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist
[1:58:55.840 --> 1:59:00.600]  act of war against this country the enemy struck America on September 11th
[1:59:00.600 --> 1:59:05.400]  but who is the enemy been locked in this is his ammo we have to look to the
[1:59:05.400 --> 1:59:08.800]  Middle East we have to look to the psalm event lot of fabled enemies is the
[1:59:08.800 --> 1:59:12.640]  first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:59:12.640 --> 1:59:16.840]  networks inside the United States some US investigators believe that there are
[1:59:16.840 --> 1:59:22.600]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US I'm aware that
[1:59:22.600 --> 1:59:27.560]  some Israeli citizens have been detained and laudans connections to the CIA the
[1:59:27.560 --> 1:59:31.400]  hijackers ties to the FBI the Saudi Arabian connection the Israeli
[1:59:31.400 --> 1:59:34.960]  intelligence network warnings and war games the shadow government and much
[1:59:34.960 --> 1:59:40.400]  much more fabled enemies get the DVD at info wars dot com or see it in super

[1:59:55.360 --> 2:00:08.400]  corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio networks big brother mainstream media
[2:00:08.400 --> 2:00:15.920]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the
[2:00:15.920 --> 2:00:26.840]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones by the way
[2:00:26.840 --> 2:00:31.120]  they're charging a bunch of people in Minnesota were not violent as terrorists
[2:00:31.120 --> 2:00:35.120]  that's meant to scare anybody from ever going to a protest again we're going in
[2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:40.880]  a complete tyranny right now also in a fascist state cameras equal terrorism in
[2:00:40.880 --> 2:00:45.080]  American England citizens are being urged to report people taking pictures as
[2:00:45.080 --> 2:00:49.280]  potential terrorist and they just come up and say turn your cameras off again
[2:00:49.280 --> 2:00:53.240]  it's social engineering there's no logins protesting there's no logins
[2:00:53.240 --> 2:00:57.240]  cameras they're going to put cameras on you but you might go to jail see that
[2:00:57.240 --> 2:01:02.000]  they're being told to social engineer us don't worry cops it's just so they can
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:05.680]  shoot you up full of that cancer it's just so they can control your life and
[2:01:05.680 --> 2:01:08.760]  ruin your future too so go ahead and think you're winning you're you're
[2:01:08.760 --> 2:01:12.440]  destroying your own family's future Aaron get back into the eugenics quotes for
[2:01:12.440 --> 2:01:15.880]  people so they understand the true nature of the new world order yeah we're
[2:01:15.880 --> 2:01:18.720]  talking about eugenics and a lot of people wonder why it's relevant today
[2:01:18.720 --> 2:01:24.240]  well there's new and worse science and still the same horrible elites a lot of
[2:01:24.240 --> 2:01:28.280]  you already know the project for a new american century quote from 2000 and
[2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:33.080]  advanced forms of biological warfare that can quote target specific genotypes
[2:01:33.080 --> 2:01:38.120]  may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically
[2:01:38.120 --> 2:01:43.720]  useful tool well I also have secretary of defense William S. Cohen in 97 a
[2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:47.840]  warning of a similar thing this is congressional testimony there are some
[2:01:47.840 --> 2:01:51.680]  reports for example that some countries have been trying to construct
[2:01:51.680 --> 2:01:55.520]  something like an ebola virus and that would be very dangerous phenomenon to
[2:01:55.520 --> 2:01:59.680]  say the least Alvin Tofler has written about this in terms of some scientists
[2:01:59.680 --> 2:02:03.920]  in their laboratories trying to devise certain types of pathogens that would be
[2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:07.940]  ethnic specific so that they could just eliminate certain ethnic groups and
[2:02:07.940 --> 2:02:12.160]  races and others are designing some sort of engineering some sort of insects
[2:02:12.160 --> 2:02:17.480]  that can destroy specific crops others even engaging an eco type of terrorism
[2:02:17.480 --> 2:02:22.540]  whereby they can alter climate set off earthquakes volcanoes he acts as a
[2:02:22.540 --> 2:02:26.920]  stop there meanwhile we have mainstream media and mainstream government
[2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:30.280]  universities admitting their spring the clouds their spring the aerosols the
[2:02:30.280 --> 2:02:36.520]  sodium you know chemicals the barium salts of the sulfur dioxide they're
[2:02:36.520 --> 2:02:40.120]  doing it and then peanut goes on and says we need to get the media ready to
[2:02:40.120 --> 2:02:44.800]  use these race weapons as a legitimate tool so they're doing this folks and
[2:02:44.800 --> 2:02:47.720]  they're not playing games the new ministry of defense british report last
[2:02:47.720 --> 2:02:51.880]  year says we'll use neutron bombs if anybody tries to take DC they'll
[2:02:51.880 --> 2:02:55.760]  neutron bomb them anybody tries to take London they'll just neutron bomb you you
[2:02:55.760 --> 2:02:58.920]  try to remove this criminal blackout government it's over we have to have
[2:02:58.920 --> 2:03:03.600]  everybody wake up at our separate cities stop going along with them let them know
[2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:08.360]  we're fully aware of their plan and then without our acquiescence they'll
[2:03:08.360 --> 2:03:11.840]  probably have to back off they'll still probably launch a bio attack and poses
[2:03:11.840 --> 2:03:15.360]  saviors but if you don't go along with it they won't do it we have to have a real
[2:03:15.360 --> 2:03:19.280]  negotiation with these people but they say they don't respect us because they
[2:03:19.280 --> 2:03:23.320]  publish all of this and then we don't even respond to them so they say that is
[2:03:23.320 --> 2:03:27.220]  acquiescence we have to have a real debate with them okay go ahead Aaron oh
[2:03:27.220 --> 2:03:30.320]  yeah and they act like they're talking about other countries will ask yourself
[2:03:30.320 --> 2:03:33.920]  who has the science who has the science military industrial complex yeah that
[2:03:33.920 --> 2:03:37.360]  that's a 97 press conference the point is in all the documents and in the 2000
[2:03:37.360 --> 2:03:42.120]  announcement they're doing it yeah it is a weapons quarterly it's the u.s. is real
[2:03:42.120 --> 2:03:45.720]  in England they're the main ones all right so if I could jump back in time
[2:03:45.720 --> 2:03:51.120]  back earlier in the century here's a Bertrand Russell 1972 the scientific
[2:03:51.120 --> 2:03:56.080]  outlook and Pregnation will be regarded in an entirely different manner more in
[2:03:56.080 --> 2:04:00.280]  the light of a surgical operation so that it will be thought not ladylike to
[2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:05.720]  have it performed in the natural manner Herman J. Moeller 1935 there's no
[2:04:05.720 --> 2:04:09.240]  permanent status that's important because it hands the control of the
[2:04:09.240 --> 2:04:13.120]  embryo over to their development so they can manipulate it and they say that now
[2:04:13.120 --> 2:04:16.160]  go ahead you can see that eugenics is a scientist they say we're gonna test for
[2:04:16.160 --> 2:04:20.080]  diseases now they're saying in England in the u.s. may and maybe we won't let you
[2:04:20.080 --> 2:04:23.120]  have that baby if there's a chance there's a problem of course they say
[2:04:23.120 --> 2:04:26.440]  what a problem is like being quote aggressive and you can see the control
[2:04:26.440 --> 2:04:30.520]  is clearly scientific dictatorship like in brave new world or etc and they're
[2:04:30.520 --> 2:04:33.960]  saying they're gonna breed to be more intelligent more precise they don't want
[2:04:33.960 --> 2:04:38.640]  to quote bad sons or the middle-class genetics that they think is dominant to
[2:04:38.640 --> 2:04:41.680]  be able to threaten them so they're seeking to stop it stay there I'm gonna
[2:04:41.680 --> 2:04:44.720]  bring Dr. Stan Montief up for a larger discussion you'll be with us for the

[2:07:04.760 --> 2:07:08.640]  to join church and state this confederation of evangelicals Catholics
[2:07:08.640 --> 2:07:12.440]  and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting block their
[2:07:12.440 --> 2:07:16.320]  agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation our
[2:07:16.320 --> 2:07:19.800]  forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom
[2:07:19.800 --> 2:07:23.040]  liberty of conscience history and the Bible proved to them that these two
[2:07:23.040 --> 2:07:27.240]  systems church and state must be kept separate it must be our love of God and
[2:07:27.240 --> 2:07:31.360]  of country that prompts or constraints us this will change the character not
[2:07:31.360 --> 2:07:35.040]  civil enforcement from history we saw that when church and state united known
[2:07:35.040 --> 2:07:38.840]  as papal Rome religious intolerance resulted this union would go directly
[2:07:38.840 --> 2:07:42.800]  contrary to the great principles of our nation America and papal Rome are
[2:07:42.800 --> 2:07:47.080]  uniting in this agenda Protestant America awake before it is too late the
[2:07:47.080 --> 2:07:52.320]  prophecies are fast-fulfilling Jesus is coming soon for free materials call 888

[2:08:01.640 --> 2:08:09.520]  ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network we've
[2:08:09.520 --> 2:08:14.080]  got Dr. Stan Monteep joining us for part two of a larger eugenics discussion
[2:08:14.080 --> 2:08:18.040]  what makes the new older tech how they believe they are the social architects
[2:08:18.040 --> 2:08:22.320]  controlling society for the last 150 years and they've indeed done that
[2:08:22.320 --> 2:08:27.120]  to a horrific effect and we're all this is going Aaron Dykes riding shotgun
[2:08:27.120 --> 2:08:30.800]  with us as well for the next 52 minutes with some interesting quotes Aaron read
[2:08:30.800 --> 2:08:34.520]  a few more of those quotes we're gonna go to medical doctor Stan Monteep also
[2:08:34.520 --> 2:08:40.000]  syndicated radio host and author in 35 Herman J. Mueller he was an assistant to
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:44.600]  Julian Huxley brother to the author Alex Huxley he talks about how man is the
[2:08:44.600 --> 2:08:49.080]  first being yet evolved which again note his own changefulness and that it
[2:08:49.080 --> 2:08:53.600]  will be to his advantage to use eugenic ideas to invent new characteristics
[2:08:53.600 --> 2:08:57.760]  organs biological systems I get this that will work out to further his
[2:08:57.760 --> 2:09:03.120]  interest happiness and the glory of the godlike being whose meager foreshadowings
[2:09:03.120 --> 2:09:07.680]  we the present alien creatures are and you'll see that the futurist have that
[2:09:07.680 --> 2:09:13.520]  same idea of mine becoming godlike creatures well it was all this Huxley
[2:09:13.520 --> 2:09:19.560]  brother Julian Huxley who founded the transhumanist movement in the 1950s
[2:09:19.560 --> 2:09:23.360]  saying we're gonna change our name because eugenics has been demonized by
[2:09:23.360 --> 2:09:27.920]  Hitler yeah he did I have that quote if you want to take the time well I mean I
[2:09:27.920 --> 2:09:30.840]  love the transhumanist call me up Sam Allier and I go well do you know who your
[2:09:30.840 --> 2:09:34.520]  founder is and I go no I have him Google it they go my god it's true well he's
[2:09:34.520 --> 2:09:38.320]  basically indicating eugenics name is spoiled but hopefully we can revive it
[2:09:38.320 --> 2:09:42.600]  someday and of course he coined the name transhumanism that's crypto eugenics
[2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:47.080]  yeah that's true now this is a futurist it's not all futurist but it shows you
[2:09:47.080 --> 2:09:52.240]  what's par for the core this is Barbara Marx Hubbard really wild stuff well the
[2:09:52.240 --> 2:09:56.720]  founders of futurism were eugenicists the point is are there some offshoots that
[2:09:56.720 --> 2:09:59.840]  don't follow it yes yeah I'm not going to read the whole quote because it's
[2:09:59.840 --> 2:10:04.080]  really too long but she gets off and she set up the Pentagon special forces
[2:10:04.080 --> 2:10:08.960]  groups go ahead and read it yeah she gets off and this is like a a revelations
[2:10:08.960 --> 2:10:12.320]  interpretation a gross distortion we don't think Monty's happy to gather all
[2:10:12.320 --> 2:10:16.720]  right out of the full spectrum of human personality one fourth is electing to
[2:10:16.720 --> 2:10:21.680]  transcend one fourth is ready to so choose given the example of one other
[2:10:21.680 --> 2:10:27.320]  the next fourth is resistant to election they are unattracted by life ever
[2:10:27.320 --> 2:10:32.360]  evolving the final fourth is destructive they are born angry with God they are
[2:10:32.360 --> 2:10:36.160]  defective seeds there have always been defective seeds in the past they were
[2:10:36.160 --> 2:10:41.000]  permitted to die a quote natural death continue quote we the elders have been
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:45.160]  patiently waiting until the very last moment before the quantum transformation
[2:10:45.160 --> 2:10:49.880]  to take action to cut out this corrupted and corrupting element in the body of
[2:10:49.880 --> 2:10:54.800]  humanity it's like watching a cancer grow now as we approach the quantum shift
[2:10:54.800 --> 2:11:00.640]  from creature human to co-creative human the human who is an inheritor of Godlike
[2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:05.760]  powers the destructive one fourth must be eliminated from the social body we
[2:11:05.760 --> 2:11:10.080]  have no choice dearly beloveds fortunately you dearly beloveds are not
[2:11:10.080 --> 2:11:15.280]  responsible for this act we are we are in charge of God's selection process for
[2:11:15.280 --> 2:11:21.480]  planet Earth he selects we destroy we are the writers of the pale horse death we
[2:11:21.480 --> 2:11:25.440]  come to bring death to those who are unable to know God the writers of the
[2:11:25.440 --> 2:11:29.960]  pale horse are about to pass among you grim reapers they will separate the
[2:11:29.960 --> 2:11:33.520]  wheat from the chair this is the most painful period in the history of
[2:11:33.520 --> 2:11:38.080]  humanity they always say it's so painful we're gonna have to murder everyone
[2:11:38.080 --> 2:11:43.160]  but it's so beautiful and now she again she trained the special forces this is
[2:11:43.160 --> 2:11:47.000]  the highest level CIA is giving this training they're they're brought into a
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:50.960]  Luciferian ritual they are told it's gonna be mass extermination and death
[2:11:50.960 --> 2:11:55.880]  for the God power for Christ to come back to earth this is the highest level
[2:11:55.880 --> 2:12:01.040]  Luciferian system she set up in special forces the earth first battalion
[2:12:01.040 --> 2:12:05.800]  which is the modern name of earth first continue Barbara Marks Hubbard who is of
[2:12:05.800 --> 2:12:10.200]  course somewhat mild because she only wants a fourth dead whereas many of them
[2:12:10.200 --> 2:12:15.080]  want 90% dead I have Eric Pionkas student Rebecca Khaleesi saying quote
[2:12:15.080 --> 2:12:19.040]  there's no denying the natural world would be a better place without people
[2:12:19.040 --> 2:12:24.040]  period all people not a selective bunch get it straight and then she's of course
[2:12:24.040 --> 2:12:27.400]  working now in bio weapons research so you have to understand ladies and
[2:12:27.400 --> 2:12:31.400]  gentlemen this is it they're coming police you're being sprayed by them
[2:12:31.400 --> 2:12:35.760]  chemtrails are admitted mainstream news just broke at prisonplanet.com you're
[2:12:35.760 --> 2:12:40.480]  being sprayed with barium salts sulfur dioxide we are all under maximum attack
[2:12:40.480 --> 2:12:46.960]  to the vaccines we are under hell force attack this is admitted police military
[2:12:46.960 --> 2:12:51.000]  you are with us they are killing you that's why cancer is up several thousand
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:54.240]  percent autism up several thousand percent actually twenty plus thousand
[2:12:54.240 --> 2:12:57.520]  percent that's why there's all these three-year-olds in my neighborhood dying
[2:12:57.520 --> 2:13:03.120]  that's why hell is upon us the GMO all of it I bring you medical doctor Stan
[2:13:03.120 --> 2:13:06.480]  Montee who exposed that age was a government bio weapons program decades
[2:13:06.480 --> 2:13:10.160]  ago has all the documents for the rest of this hour I wanted to preface it with
[2:13:10.160 --> 2:13:14.200]  that doctor it is really great to have you up with us well it's good to be with
[2:13:14.200 --> 2:13:18.120]  you Alex and I think that quotation you just read from Barbara Marks Hubbard
[2:13:18.120 --> 2:13:23.080]  it's so important this was in the original manuscript that she wrote called
[2:13:23.080 --> 2:13:27.040]  the revelation the book of co-creation and she actually went all over the
[2:13:27.040 --> 2:13:32.360]  country and giving talks to her disciples the book was actually and she
[2:13:32.360 --> 2:13:36.800]  admits channel to her by a spirit she called it the Christ spirit I think it
[2:13:36.800 --> 2:13:42.480]  was a demonic spirit and basically what preface what you just read was
[2:13:42.480 --> 2:13:47.040]  revelation 6-8 and she quoted from revelation 6-8 and I looked and the
[2:13:47.040 --> 2:13:51.600]  hold a pale horse and the rider upon him is deaf and any of your readers should
[2:13:51.600 --> 2:13:56.600]  go ahead and read revelation 6-8 and then of course he extrapolates or the
[2:13:56.600 --> 2:14:01.440]  demonic force which is acting through her extrapolates that talking about the
[2:14:01.440 --> 2:14:05.680]  necessity of killing that one quarter who will not of course ascend to the next
[2:14:05.680 --> 2:14:09.120]  higher level of development she's talking about the Christians and then she
[2:14:09.120 --> 2:14:14.960]  concludes that is not your job my dear that is ours for we are the writers of
[2:14:14.960 --> 2:14:19.040]  the pale horse death this is one of the most powerful women in America this is
[2:14:19.040 --> 2:14:23.640]  a woman who actually ran for the vice presidency of the United States I think
[2:14:23.640 --> 2:14:29.900]  it was in 1984 she ran against their that's Geraldine Ferrara with Geraldine
[2:14:29.900 --> 2:14:33.920]  Ferrara was selected and and of course fortunately she didn't become the
[2:14:33.920 --> 2:14:37.880]  either of the vice president of the president but this is a sort of people
[2:14:37.880 --> 2:14:42.080]  you have working within within the political process she thinks nothing
[2:14:42.080 --> 2:14:45.280]  wrong with killing a quarter of the population and everything is about
[2:14:45.280 --> 2:14:50.160]  bringing in the death has to happen now now now she's on the very liberal loving
[2:14:50.160 --> 2:14:55.080]  side of only killing a few billion the mainline group becoming dominant says
[2:14:55.080 --> 2:14:59.600]  total human extermination but the final globalist will have their head chopped
[2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:05.280]  off in a robotic you know final final execution of humanity we just read a
[2:15:05.280 --> 2:15:08.600]  quote of that earlier and these people are all in bio weapons development
[2:15:08.600 --> 2:15:12.640]  they're running everything I don't think the population realizes this is the new
[2:15:12.640 --> 2:15:17.880]  world order doctor I don't think they do either because you see Alex when when
[2:15:17.880 --> 2:15:21.440]  we talk about the plan and because you went to the Georgia guy don't you at
[2:15:21.440 --> 2:15:24.480]  least you know the story the judge a couple of you guys don't it's an end
[2:15:24.480 --> 2:15:28.080]  in Georgia when they talk about eliminating over 90% of the world
[2:15:28.080 --> 2:15:33.040]  population the average listener out there says this is not logical no logical
[2:15:33.040 --> 2:15:37.160]  person would do that and you have to agree with them no logical person would
[2:15:37.160 --> 2:15:40.640]  do that but we're not dealing with logical people we're dealing with people
[2:15:40.640 --> 2:15:45.560]  with a different world view who would actually destroy humanity because the
[2:15:45.560 --> 2:15:49.920]  cults are heavily driven they're heavily powerful wealthy people have always been
[2:15:49.920 --> 2:15:55.960]  involved this is the dominant Luciferian sex cult that's running things and I
[2:15:55.960 --> 2:15:59.120]  mean break down who the new world order is your book brotherhood of darkness I
[2:15:59.120 --> 2:16:03.280]  mean boil it down to very simple terms what are we dealing with what's their
[2:16:03.280 --> 2:16:08.840]  master plan we're dealing with a number of secrets or semi-secret societies
[2:16:08.840 --> 2:16:13.160]  other of course have a master plan of creating a one-world government a one
[2:16:13.160 --> 2:16:17.560]  world religion but the destruction of Christianity and a one world leader and
[2:16:17.560 --> 2:16:21.360]  since we lift them all in the brotherhood of darkness and and then we
[2:16:21.360 --> 2:16:25.560]  come up with new ones all the time I'm constantly amazed how many organizations
[2:16:25.560 --> 2:16:29.560]  there are even beyond those mentioned in my book brotherhood of darkness just came
[2:16:29.560 --> 2:16:33.800]  across the group called the family recently they put on the the annual
[2:16:33.800 --> 2:16:37.800]  prayer presidential prayer breakfast Christians come from all over the country
[2:16:37.800 --> 2:16:42.240]  make large donations to attend the prayer breakfast put on by a cult called the
[2:16:42.240 --> 2:16:46.560]  family and believe me of course they have an entirely different agenda and then
[2:16:46.560 --> 2:16:51.080]  you find out that you may have a hundred different groups but there's the
[2:16:51.080 --> 2:16:56.120]  hundred leaders are then part of the supergroup amen to that but what they
[2:16:56.120 --> 2:17:00.400]  are all bound together by the spirits of forces that energize them and if you
[2:17:00.400 --> 2:17:04.920]  don't understand that there really are Luciferian forces out there there really
[2:17:04.920 --> 2:17:08.960]  are people who worship the Prince of this world and have given themselves over
[2:17:08.960 --> 2:17:14.240]  to the dark side and there is power there there you are promised wealth and
[2:17:14.240 --> 2:17:20.200]  notoriety and fame and and power but you know in the process you're going to give
[2:17:20.200 --> 2:17:25.880]  up your soul these people actually made a deal with the devil knowingly or
[2:17:25.880 --> 2:17:31.280]  unknowingly they've done it incidentally and that the quotation the book of the
[2:17:31.280 --> 2:17:35.520]  revelation the book of co-creation by Barbara Marks Hubbard was eventually
[2:17:35.520 --> 2:17:40.640]  republished to the slightly watered-down version but it was funded by the Lawrence
[2:17:40.640 --> 2:17:44.800]  Rockefeller endowment for the humanities the Lawrence Rockefeller
[2:17:44.800 --> 2:17:49.040]  endowment for the humanities and then you begin to see these a cult movement
[2:17:49.040 --> 2:17:53.440]  within the Rockefeller family doing everything they can to destroy humanity
[2:17:53.440 --> 2:17:58.040]  and civilization and they put the sickest face on it if it's beautiful my
[2:17:58.040 --> 2:18:02.920]  darlings the mass blood and slaughter soon in and that's how peonca talks I
[2:18:02.920 --> 2:18:07.200]  know I'll have to die me and my family we're looking forward to the death it's
[2:18:07.200 --> 2:18:11.880]  going to be so beautiful and then he projects giant skulls and a power point
[2:18:11.880 --> 2:18:16.780]  and the Texas Academy of Sciences rises for a three-minute standing ovation with
[2:18:16.780 --> 2:18:23.080]  tears you know that's the issue it's not just some isolated nut
[2:18:23.080 --> 2:18:27.160]  and then their weirdo graduate students now working at you know bio weapons
[2:18:27.160 --> 2:18:30.560]  facilities and other research labs send us emails going you don't know how
[2:18:30.560 --> 2:18:35.400]  beautiful the death will be I mean this is like out of a horror movie well
[2:18:35.400 --> 2:18:40.320]  unfortunately it is a horror movie and these things are under way today they
[2:18:40.320 --> 2:18:44.680]  are exterminating large numbers of people but we don't know about that the
[2:18:44.680 --> 2:18:48.720]  AIDS epidemic as you pointed out at the beginning we are not trying to stop the
[2:18:48.720 --> 2:18:51.160]  AIDS epidemic is spending a lot of money but we're not doing what's
[2:18:51.160 --> 2:18:55.080]  necessary to stop the spread of this disease they only spend the money to
[2:18:55.080 --> 2:18:58.960]  institutionalize it and fund the very groups that launch the attacks and then
[2:18:58.960 --> 2:19:03.360]  to that in Botswana today and we have the statistics that come from the U.S.
[2:19:03.360 --> 2:19:07.440]  Commerce Department where we are actually monitoring the spread of AIDS in
[2:19:07.440 --> 2:19:12.520]  Botswana and one of the most highly developed but best educated nations in
[2:19:12.520 --> 2:19:18.720]  all of Africa by a prior black control of population 46 percent of the
[2:19:18.720 --> 2:19:23.720]  pregnant women in Botswana are now HIV positive and they're all going to die
[2:19:23.720 --> 2:19:27.680]  now that is the either the greatest public health failure or the most
[2:19:27.680 --> 2:19:32.040]  successful genocidal policy we've ever seen and I would like to suggest if it
[2:19:32.040 --> 2:19:35.320]  was a public health failure that it changes the public health approach but
[2:19:35.320 --> 2:19:39.520]  they haven't stay there doctor we got a break and notice okay you list these
[2:19:39.520 --> 2:19:43.720]  statistics wherever you have more of the UN World Health Organization you
[2:19:43.720 --> 2:19:47.000]  magically have more of the AIDS and then you've got the documents where the U.S.
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:51.120]  government developed this variant of a cancer virus I want to get into the
[2:19:51.120 --> 2:19:55.920]  Rockefellers in cancer as well dr. Stan Monteith radio Liberty commas his

[2:20:09.520 --> 2:20:13.800]  or even impossible to avoid even trace amounts of these heavy metals over time
[2:20:13.800 --> 2:20:17.320]  can impact your health many health problems have been suggested as being

[2:24:32.040 --> 2:24:38.080]  are the cancer is saying we're the cancer they're moving against us now they
[2:24:38.080 --> 2:24:43.720]  are killing us all right now they're attacking you savagely medical doctor
[2:24:43.720 --> 2:24:48.360]  Stan Monteev is our guest let's recap how age was engineered and then all
[2:24:48.360 --> 2:24:51.840]  these new syndromes like if they taser thousands to death they say it's a
[2:24:51.840 --> 2:24:55.600]  syndrome that you just died it's not the taser or it's a syndrome that Crohn's
[2:24:55.600 --> 2:25:01.680]  goes from you know one in hundreds of thousands to now one in 200 and what
[2:25:01.680 --> 2:25:07.120]  they're doing sir their master plan well they intend to eliminate a large part
[2:25:07.120 --> 2:25:10.240]  of the world's population and specifically here in the United States
[2:25:10.240 --> 2:25:14.400]  especially the elderly and first they're using medications they're using
[2:25:14.400 --> 2:25:19.240]  vaccines and if you analyze what they're doing for instance this last week a
[2:25:19.240 --> 2:25:24.080]  report came out and said that the influenza vaccine with their CDC is
[2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:30.440]  recommending for every elderly individual this the influenza vaccine
[2:25:30.440 --> 2:25:34.240]  really doesn't work there's no evidence that it helps at all but you should take
[2:25:34.240 --> 2:25:38.000]  it anyway now why would you take a vaccine that doesn't work but because
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:41.600]  it has mercury in it they took the mercury out of the childhood vaccines
[2:25:41.600 --> 2:25:46.000]  and most of it but they left it in vaccines that are given to the two
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:50.200]  children and that question the elderly and that the influenza vaccine it
[2:25:50.200 --> 2:25:55.880]  doesn't work they all almost invariably engineered for the wrong virus but
[2:25:55.880 --> 2:26:00.280]  there's a very definite relationship between of course Alzheimer's disease
[2:26:00.280 --> 2:26:07.840]  and the influenza vaccine in fact doctor if you just Google as you know but you
[2:26:07.840 --> 2:26:11.520]  read the actual medical reports these are prestigious medical journals major
[2:26:11.520 --> 2:26:15.640]  university studies going back for a decade that one of the big ones is if
[2:26:15.640 --> 2:26:20.040]  you get three flu shots it doubles your chance of Alzheimer's I mean they know
[2:26:20.040 --> 2:26:24.560]  this isn't even a theory is it no it isn't at all they know exactly what
[2:26:24.560 --> 2:26:28.960]  they're doing the big figures put out by dr. Putinberg who claims that if you
[2:26:28.960 --> 2:26:33.520]  take three to four flu shots over a five-year period between the 60 and 65
[2:26:33.520 --> 2:26:38.920]  your incidence of Alzheimer's disease goes up a thousand percent goes up ten
[2:26:38.920 --> 2:26:44.680]  fold that's food and work if you TENB ERG you can actually Google that on the
[2:26:44.680 --> 2:26:48.240]  internet we can't get it will be glad to see I was going from memory I just said
[2:26:48.240 --> 2:26:54.040]  double people think I exaggerate it's always under it's never as bad doctor
[2:26:54.040 --> 2:26:57.400]  they're now admitting that chemtrails are real there's a giant program since
[2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:02.480]  96 exactly when we said it started to spray aerosols it's mixed in with the
[2:27:02.480 --> 2:27:06.840]  fuel perfectly compartmentalized that shows how the doctors don't know what
[2:27:06.840 --> 2:27:10.560]  they're doing the nurses don't know the guys flying the jets don't know it can
[2:27:10.560 --> 2:27:14.960]  you speak to compartmentalization carrying this out well all I can say is
[2:27:14.960 --> 2:27:19.520]  that the average doctor is really wants to help his patients but he doesn't get
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:23.880]  the information that you and I would get from the alternative media he doesn't
[2:27:23.880 --> 2:27:27.760]  have time he's so busy trying to scrape out a living today and believe me the
[2:27:27.760 --> 2:27:30.720]  doctors under tremendous pressure from government they're cutting back their
[2:27:30.720 --> 2:27:35.360]  income so he has to listen to the detailed man or the detailed woman with
[2:27:35.360 --> 2:27:39.320]  the short skirt who comes into their office to tell him how good by Toran is
[2:27:39.320 --> 2:27:42.960]  or or some other medication that they've really got to get this for their
[2:27:42.960 --> 2:27:47.120]  patients and the problem is that a lot of these medications are killing people
[2:27:47.120 --> 2:27:51.520]  and the doctors are pushing it the doctors are pushing the vaccines and I
[2:27:51.520 --> 2:27:55.760]  know when I practice medicine they said so many times that vaccines were safe
[2:27:55.760 --> 2:28:00.080]  and effective I really believed it I didn't realize of course it put a a
[2:28:00.080 --> 2:28:05.080]  cancer-producing virus into the polio vaccine it was grown in the kidney of
[2:28:05.080 --> 2:28:09.160]  the green monkey and the green monkey had or it was in the kit that green monkey
[2:28:09.160 --> 2:28:14.320]  the Reese's monkey about any way the monkey had it all these viruses that
[2:28:14.320 --> 2:28:21.120]  were transmitted it was both as you know dr. sock on cbc admitted that they
[2:28:21.120 --> 2:28:24.680]  actually used monkeys from previous bio weapons experiments then he started
[2:28:24.680 --> 2:28:30.240]  laughing well unfortunately why the majority of the people in our country
[2:28:30.240 --> 2:28:36.000]  all got a polio vaccine that had a cancer-producing virus in it and then we
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:40.080]  wonder why the incidence of cancer is exploding at the beginning of the last
[2:28:40.080 --> 2:28:46.480]  century in the early 1900s one in 33 people contracted cancer today it's one
[2:28:46.480 --> 2:28:50.800]  of every three women and one of every two men and of course many of these
[2:28:50.800 --> 2:28:56.640]  cancers when they're analyzed actually contain the semi-invigorated and that's
[2:28:56.640 --> 2:29:00.240]  just one vaccine they found other cancer viruses and many other vaccines that
[2:29:00.240 --> 2:29:03.880]  aren't even associated with the production of it they found the female
[2:29:03.880 --> 2:29:08.480]  hormone being added to the tetanus tell folks about that well basically what they
[2:29:08.480 --> 2:29:12.200]  did we know they did this in the Philippines and in Kenya because I've
[2:29:12.200 --> 2:29:15.720]  talked to doctors from there but we there's a great deal of evidence they
[2:29:15.720 --> 2:29:19.440]  did in other countries basically they would come into the the country and they
[2:29:19.440 --> 2:29:23.720]  would say we're from the world health organization and we're here to help you
[2:29:23.720 --> 2:29:29.440]  any woman in the childbearing years would like a free tetanus vaccine so your
[2:29:29.440 --> 2:29:34.280]  child doesn't get tetanus and Christmas does occur very in children in third
[2:29:34.280 --> 2:29:38.000]  world countries when the Christmas women have their child stay there let's finish

[2:32:48.560 --> 2:32:52.800]  him up and there's so many examples of this foster children and having
[2:32:52.800 --> 2:32:56.640]  pesticides and drugs tested on them till they die thousands of children being
[2:32:56.640 --> 2:33:01.720]  radiated to death in the US and Israel I mean this is so massive this is going on
[2:33:01.720 --> 2:33:06.040]  everywhere and then there are so many examples of the eugenics being carried
[2:33:06.040 --> 2:33:09.520]  out against free humanity that it boggles the mind but let's go back to the
[2:33:09.520 --> 2:33:12.520]  root of this Aaron read a few more quotes before we go back to dr. Monteef
[2:33:12.520 --> 2:33:17.120]  I'll let the listeners discern the difference between the intellectual
[2:33:17.120 --> 2:33:22.480]  theory and what's actually going on in the world but here is Bertrand Russell
[2:33:22.480 --> 2:33:27.720]  the impact of science on society 1953 complete examination of the eugenical
[2:33:27.720 --> 2:33:32.720]  scientific dictatorship quote I do not pretend that birth control is the only
[2:33:32.720 --> 2:33:37.360]  way in which population could be kept from increasing war has hitherto been
[2:33:37.360 --> 2:33:42.520]  disappointing in this respect but perhaps bacteriological war may prove more
[2:33:42.520 --> 2:33:46.680]  effective if a black death could be spread throughout the world once in
[2:33:46.680 --> 2:33:50.400]  every generation survivors could procreate freely without making the
[2:33:50.400 --> 2:33:54.880]  world too full the state of affairs might be somewhat unpleasant but what of
[2:33:54.880 --> 2:33:58.960]  that really high-minded people are indifferent to happiness especially
[2:33:58.960 --> 2:34:03.400]  other peoples there are three ways of securing a society that should be stable
[2:34:03.400 --> 2:34:08.440]  as regards the population the first is birth control second infanticide or
[2:34:08.440 --> 2:34:12.600]  really destructive wars and the third that of general misery except for a
[2:34:12.600 --> 2:34:18.040]  powerful minority now Aaron earlier before dr. Monteef joined us you read
[2:34:18.040 --> 2:34:21.760]  all the official Defense Department and PNAC documents where they said we want
[2:34:21.760 --> 2:34:26.280]  to use race specific bio weapons to target certain races and we need to
[2:34:26.280 --> 2:34:30.320]  legitimize this in the media dr. Monteef finish up with you're talking about
[2:34:30.320 --> 2:34:34.240]  AIDS being a US government program go through some of that evidence go through
[2:34:34.240 --> 2:34:39.000]  some of the evidence we were talking about with the tetanus shots of the
[2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:43.600]  female hormone added to sterilize them and then let's get into these race
[2:34:43.600 --> 2:34:49.080]  specific bio weapons dr. Monteef who is a medical doctor well first of all what
[2:34:49.080 --> 2:34:53.160]  they did with the all with the tetanus vaccine that they gave to women that we
[2:34:53.160 --> 2:34:57.000]  know specifically in Kenya and Philippines but probably most many other
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:02.040]  third-world countries they put in a choreo canada trophine which is a hormone
[2:35:02.040 --> 2:35:06.600]  which is necessary a woman secretes when she of course becomes pregnant and it
[2:35:06.600 --> 2:35:11.480]  protects the the the fetus from abortion unfortunately by putting this
[2:35:11.480 --> 2:35:16.600]  in a vaccine the woman became sensitive to it and of course when she began to
[2:35:16.600 --> 2:35:21.560]  actually got pregnant and the fetus began to produce the choreo canada
[2:35:21.560 --> 2:35:26.400]  trophine the auto the woman's immune system would destroy that and so other
[2:35:26.400 --> 2:35:30.600]  women could not conceive and become pregnant this was done as part of a
[2:35:30.600 --> 2:35:35.320]  worldwide program but they can't let the people in the third-world countries or
[2:35:35.320 --> 2:35:38.400]  certainly the people in the United States understand this is what our tax
[2:35:38.400 --> 2:35:42.720]  money is being used for as far as the manufacture the AIDS epidemic is
[2:35:42.720 --> 2:35:47.840]  concerned there's a wonderful book called full disclosure full disclosure and
[2:35:47.840 --> 2:35:51.400]  you can get it on the internet it's out of print but of course there the author
[2:35:51.400 --> 2:35:55.960]  has actually talked to a man who was there when they were actually producing
[2:35:55.960 --> 2:36:01.280]  creating the AIDS virus the HIV virus certainly my good friend Dr. Garth
[2:36:01.280 --> 2:36:04.720]  Nicholson who's one of the world's leading scientists has written a book
[2:36:04.720 --> 2:36:10.440]  which we do carry called project a lily and he talks there about how they
[2:36:10.440 --> 2:36:16.080]  actually engineered of the disease and of course it's really not simply HIV
[2:36:16.080 --> 2:36:20.840]  HIV only predisposes people to this it's a mycoplasm a pathologist they
[2:36:20.840 --> 2:36:25.240]  genetically altered mycoplasm for mantens that does so much of the
[2:36:25.240 --> 2:36:28.520]  devastation and doctor and I've seen all the studies but you're a medical
[2:36:28.520 --> 2:36:31.720]  doctor and we've had epidemiologists don't talk about it and virologists but
[2:36:31.720 --> 2:36:35.760]  isn't it also predisposed towards people with color I mean it can kill any
[2:36:35.760 --> 2:36:41.920]  homo sapien sapien but but isn't a isn't HIV designed as the precursor for the
[2:36:41.920 --> 2:36:46.920]  other race specific bio weapons absolutely I mean HIV you know if you
[2:36:46.920 --> 2:36:51.240]  look at the statistics here in the United States almost not quite but almost
[2:36:51.240 --> 2:36:56.400]  half of the other people with HIV and AIDS who died have been black and of
[2:36:56.400 --> 2:37:00.160]  course if the statistics show it has the present predisposition for the black
[2:37:00.160 --> 2:37:04.560]  and Hispanic and much but paid off black leaders won't talk about it
[2:37:04.560 --> 2:37:08.600]  Hispanic leaders won't they'll just have fake race politics or did somebody
[2:37:08.600 --> 2:37:12.240]  call them the n-word which you go back to Margaret Sanger and the Colgate
[2:37:12.240 --> 2:37:15.360]  letters to the foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation papers these are
[2:37:15.360 --> 2:37:19.880]  public we actually sent off for them at the different universities saying we
[2:37:19.880 --> 2:37:22.920]  can't let the blacks know we want to exterminate them we've got a higher
[2:37:22.920 --> 2:37:27.120]  liberal front blacks in fact Aaron has the quotes but but you were trying to
[2:37:27.120 --> 2:37:31.240]  explain the numbers that that that even though you have much larger amounts of
[2:37:31.240 --> 2:37:35.320]  whites just as sexually promiscuous even with the same control groups it's
[2:37:35.320 --> 2:37:40.000]  harder for a white to get AIDS please continue well basically they know how
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:45.640]  to create diseases for specific races and there's one specific gene and we
[2:37:45.640 --> 2:37:49.600]  don't have it we white people don't have it or maybe we only have one of the two
[2:37:49.600 --> 2:37:54.080]  that pair we don't have the proper couplers for the virus to plug into and
[2:37:54.080 --> 2:38:00.120]  this is the coupler that is used to attach the HIV virus to the cell
[2:38:00.120 --> 2:38:04.400]  the cells they're going to be attacked so the blacks usually it will have both
[2:38:04.400 --> 2:38:09.480]  of those genes most whites will have either one or none of them and if you
[2:38:09.480 --> 2:38:13.240]  don't have any of the genes you're not going to get HIV no matter how promiscuous
[2:38:13.240 --> 2:38:18.960]  you are if you have one of them you may get it and this is why I said the almost
[2:38:18.960 --> 2:38:23.960]  half of the people here in the United States who have either have HIV or have
[2:38:23.960 --> 2:38:27.840]  died are black this is race specific disease many of your listeners would
[2:38:27.840 --> 2:38:31.760]  like to know more about it I wrote an article published by the American
[2:38:31.760 --> 2:38:36.400]  Journal of Physicians and Surgeons it was called AIDS the Unknown Story and I'd
[2:38:36.400 --> 2:38:39.400]  be glad to provide those free of charge could I put on my 800 number
[2:38:39.400 --> 2:38:45.560]  absolutely put that out and also give people your website 800 5 4 4 8 9 2 7
[2:38:45.560 --> 2:38:50.600]  800 5 4 4 8 9 2 7 we'll send you free of charge a copy of the article we wrote
[2:38:50.600 --> 2:38:56.560]  that goes into the background of the race specificity of of HIV disease they
[2:38:56.560 --> 2:39:01.440]  do what they were doing our website radio liberty.com but you can read the
[2:39:01.440 --> 2:39:04.760]  things they certainly have the PNAC website of the project for the new
[2:39:04.760 --> 2:39:09.320]  American sensory something they wrote entitled other rebuilding America's
[2:39:09.320 --> 2:39:12.800]  defenses where they talk about how they're going to have the ability to have
[2:39:12.800 --> 2:39:17.800]  these race specific diseases and then they can use it for social purposes and
[2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:21.920]  they've targeted the black they've targeted the Hispanic and I share your
[2:39:21.920 --> 2:39:26.600]  concern Alex why aren't the black leaders talking about that because most of
[2:39:26.600 --> 2:39:30.640]  her bought and paid for. Now let's go back and then I want to read some
[2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:34.160]  Margaret Sanger quotes here let's go back what was it like for you as a you
[2:39:34.160 --> 2:39:39.200]  know very successful you know you know medical doctor surgeon what was it like
[2:39:39.200 --> 2:39:43.680]  for you as you began to your awakening I mean how did you awaken to this and
[2:39:43.680 --> 2:39:47.880]  become one of the most prominent respected people exposing race specific
[2:39:47.880 --> 2:39:53.760]  by a warfare that we're now more than three decades into. Well basically of
[2:39:53.760 --> 2:39:57.520]  course it isn't very good for your practice but we are always able to
[2:39:57.520 --> 2:40:01.240]  survive there were always doctors out there who would refer to me I was a
[2:40:01.240 --> 2:40:05.400]  specialist in orthopedic surgery and there were doctors who maybe wouldn't
[2:40:05.400 --> 2:40:09.880]  take a stand themselves but it backed me so I was able to survive but but
[2:40:09.880 --> 2:40:14.120]  there is so much to this story we've written a book called AIDS the
[2:40:14.120 --> 2:40:18.600]  Unnecessary Epidemic totally blacked out by the media every time we go to get it
[2:40:18.600 --> 2:40:22.960]  a listed you know with the the national a list of books in print why somebody
[2:40:22.960 --> 2:40:27.400]  came along and take it out but we were able to get I think 20 almost 30,000
[2:40:27.400 --> 2:40:32.000]  copies that book out across America people have to understand the last
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:35.960]  thing that the wicked people wanted for the people American people to wake up
[2:40:35.960 --> 2:40:40.440]  and understand the genocidal programs underway that have targeted them and
[2:40:40.440 --> 2:40:48.160]  their children but specifically the blacks and Hispanics continue though why
[2:40:48.160 --> 2:40:57.200]  why does the New World Order Dr. Monteef why does the New World Order want to
[2:40:57.200 --> 2:41:01.040]  kill so many people I mean we know it has a religious base it also has this
[2:41:01.040 --> 2:41:06.440]  eugenics scientific rationale why do they want this basically because they are
[2:41:06.440 --> 2:41:10.960]  carrying out of the prophecies of the book of Revelation I mean you read
[2:41:10.960 --> 2:41:13.600]  Revelation 6-8 they tell you they're going to kill a quarter of the
[2:41:13.600 --> 2:41:18.200]  population and then of course you go on and they're going to kill billions more
[2:41:18.200 --> 2:41:22.800]  and people have to really understand these people are deadly serious they are
[2:41:22.800 --> 2:41:27.560]  trying to bring to path of the horror that is described in the revelation
[2:41:27.560 --> 2:41:31.280]  because they think that is going to bring their leader to power and we have a
[2:41:31.280 --> 2:41:34.680]  bunch of TV viewers right now as we just went live ten minutes ago for
[2:41:34.680 --> 2:41:38.760]  prisonplanet.tv viewers and later this will be all over the web earlier we read
[2:41:38.760 --> 2:41:45.240]  what the special forces are taught what vice presidential candidates and you
[2:41:45.240 --> 2:41:50.040]  know people have pushed the first earth battalion and the rest of it about how
[2:41:50.040 --> 2:41:53.960]  their job is to exterminate the majority of the population you know how this is
[2:41:53.960 --> 2:41:58.600]  their goal so super folks out there watching get into some of that dr.
[2:41:58.600 --> 2:42:02.080]  Monteef and we're going to read a few quotes for people out there watching well
[2:42:02.080 --> 2:42:06.640]  unfortunately you know a lot of people of patriotic people get into special forces
[2:42:06.640 --> 2:42:10.480]  and do not realize once they get in they're going to be indoctrinated you
[2:42:10.480 --> 2:42:15.160]  know into the occult and their strong occult forces within the American
[2:42:15.160 --> 2:42:20.800]  special forces just as they were within the SS offered in Hitler's Germany SS
[2:42:20.800 --> 2:42:25.280]  with the cult organization and even though many people get joined the
[2:42:25.280 --> 2:42:30.160]  military and get into these specialized organization that they are certainly
[2:42:30.160 --> 2:42:34.600]  indoctrinated in these occult concepts I just hope that they're not accepting
[2:42:34.600 --> 2:42:38.360]  them I hope that we have enough people in the military who love america and
[2:42:38.360 --> 2:42:42.240]  realize their loyalty that is to our country in our constitution not to the
[2:42:42.240 --> 2:42:45.920]  wicked people who sees control of our government and they're using people by
[2:42:45.920 --> 2:42:51.000]  Barbara Marks covered and other occult individuals in fact they even have
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:55.840]  divisions with our military that are into remote viewing they're into you know
[2:42:55.840 --> 2:43:00.160]  trying to get up well actually had major general stubble bind who now is
[2:43:00.160 --> 2:43:03.800]  anti-new world order he said he never saw the master plan he was also the head
[2:43:03.800 --> 2:43:07.400]  of army intelligence before that and he said yeah they they were they were into
[2:43:07.400 --> 2:43:11.680]  the occult they were commanded to go in and do this they're now making a major
[2:43:11.680 --> 2:43:16.920]  movie with George Clooney about it but but that the higher ups told them go and
[2:43:16.920 --> 2:43:20.760]  then now he's you know now he says it's a eugenics plan a worldwide extermination
[2:43:20.760 --> 2:43:25.360]  plan that even as the commander of army special forces who was in there training
[2:43:25.360 --> 2:43:29.760]  them in the occult he was just following orders and didn't see the big plan I'm
[2:43:29.760 --> 2:43:34.760]  sure this is absolutely true and I will tell you you know if you analyze I mean
[2:43:34.760 --> 2:43:40.280]  the ability to actually remote view to actually have these super natural
[2:43:40.280 --> 2:43:44.560]  experiences to be able to have your body taken over and somebody else speak
[2:43:44.560 --> 2:43:48.480]  towards it would be totally intriguing for somebody unless they understood that
[2:43:48.480 --> 2:43:52.800]  we're told in the Bible specifically to avoid the mediums and the fortune tellers
[2:43:52.800 --> 2:43:57.200]  and and certainly the people are into spiritualism and the supernatural I mean
[2:43:57.200 --> 2:44:01.080]  it's intriguing awful lot of people get into it without ever realizing of course
[2:44:01.080 --> 2:44:05.000]  the power does not come from the God we worship but from the prince of this
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:08.600]  world and notice they'll always put flowery terms and love and peace is
[2:44:08.600 --> 2:44:12.040]  coming and this wonderful utopia is coming but first we've got to kill
[2:44:12.040 --> 2:44:17.000]  billions and that is what seems so incredible but you know it's not like
[2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:20.960]  people who accepted communism they honestly believe that all we have to do
[2:44:20.960 --> 2:44:25.280]  is kill enough people and eventually we'll change mankind and then this
[2:44:25.280 --> 2:44:30.120]  world utopia will come and of course they were lied to but the communism is
[2:44:30.120 --> 2:44:34.720]  only a transitional step towards what we're really up against now and we are
[2:44:34.720 --> 2:44:38.840]  up against powerful spiritual forces that are working through a number of
[2:44:38.840 --> 2:44:43.880]  organizations trying to destroy our belief in God and family and country and
[2:44:43.880 --> 2:44:49.520]  and and basically these are the people who are have control of the range of
[2:44:49.520 --> 2:44:53.880]  power in the United States and they're using the military and financial power
[2:44:53.880 --> 2:44:57.440]  in the United States now I want to be clear doctor world government yeah and
[2:44:57.440 --> 2:45:01.360]  once you talk about world government but to be clear we've got a lot of atheists
[2:45:01.360 --> 2:45:05.000]  and agnostics listening even if you don't believe in spiritualism or God the
[2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:10.960]  devil dark and light any of that it is a scientific fact that the elite world
[2:45:10.960 --> 2:45:17.120]  system the the the technological control grid the technological you know
[2:45:17.120 --> 2:45:21.960]  worldwide enslavement system is a new world order controlled it they are
[2:45:21.960 --> 2:45:25.840]  into the occult their goal is to get world government so they can kill the
[2:45:25.840 --> 2:45:29.240]  majority of us that is an official State Department documents official
[2:45:29.240 --> 2:45:34.680]  British documents it's in all their publications God help us folks they are
[2:45:34.680 --> 2:45:39.160]  spraying poison in the skies the water the food it's all big it's all coming
[2:45:39.160 --> 2:45:42.520]  out now and I wanted Aaron to read some more eugenics quotes and then we'll go
[2:45:42.520 --> 2:45:45.800]  back to Dr. Monteef read some more of those Aaron yeah I guess I'll go over
[2:45:45.800 --> 2:45:51.480]  some Margaret Singer quotes here a lot of which I read yesterday no woman shall
[2:45:51.480 --> 2:45:55.480]  have the legal right to bear a child without a permit for parenthood this
[2:45:55.480 --> 2:45:58.840]  was part of the American baby coach he tried to have passed his law and now
[2:45:58.840 --> 2:46:02.760]  that's being proposed China did it now it's being sold here that you'll get
[2:46:02.760 --> 2:46:06.240]  tax breaks if you don't have more than one child yeah Nazi Germany did it too
[2:46:06.240 --> 2:46:10.520]  but remember when and the CPS taking kids Nazi Germany England the US social
[2:46:10.520 --> 2:46:14.880]  workers were founded for this in game blueprint for global enslavement covers
[2:46:14.880 --> 2:46:18.800]  it continue we have people get into the bait because it's so contentious was
[2:46:18.800 --> 2:46:23.320]  Margaret Singer killer was she racist did she want to kill all these people
[2:46:23.320 --> 2:46:27.640]  well you can see the racism in the system she was Rockefeller funded so was
[2:46:27.640 --> 2:46:33.000]  German Nazi eugenics Rockefeller funded I think you could see the racism in the
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:37.360]  whole system and the intent to kill regardless of the this individual said
[2:46:37.360 --> 2:46:40.520]  that in her quotes are not what she did of course she referred to people's
[2:46:40.520 --> 2:46:44.400]  weeds and so they should be exterminated yeah where's a quote about we can't let
[2:46:44.400 --> 2:46:48.320]  the blacks know we want to exterminate him I was kind of a tongue-in-cheek but
[2:46:48.320 --> 2:46:51.600]  that's my point you could see it in the larger system we should hire three or
[2:46:51.600 --> 2:46:55.800]  four colored ministers preferably with social services backgrounds and with
[2:46:55.800 --> 2:46:59.720]  engaging personalities the most successful educational approach to the
[2:46:59.720 --> 2:47:03.920]  Negro is through a religious appeal we don't want the word to go out that we
[2:47:03.920 --> 2:47:08.040]  want to exterminate the Negro population and if the minister is the man who
[2:47:08.040 --> 2:47:11.760]  could straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more
[2:47:11.760 --> 2:47:17.400]  rebellious members she wrote in 39 to Clarence gamble of a procter and gamble
[2:47:17.400 --> 2:47:22.920]  and um yeah I mean that's basically it there were a lot of black leaders who
[2:47:22.920 --> 2:47:28.440]  were sort of into the idea of you know making the race kind of better quality
[2:47:28.440 --> 2:47:31.760]  than over no they certainly have they were on the payroll let's go back to
[2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:36.160]  Dr. Montee that's why the black leaders and Hispanic leaders they'll let the
[2:47:36.160 --> 2:47:40.360]  Mexicans wave Mexican flags all day you just take that shot baby you know their
[2:47:40.360 --> 2:47:43.480]  Mexican leaders won't tell them that will they doc? No they certainly won't
[2:47:43.480 --> 2:47:47.840]  and the tragic is that there really are people who have this white supremacist
[2:47:47.840 --> 2:47:52.000]  attitude I have to be white but certainly I believe every person is made in the
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:57.240]  image and likeness of God whether black or yellow or red or white but the
[2:47:57.240 --> 2:48:01.760]  people who were involved in this really are followers of a woman named Helena
[2:48:01.760 --> 2:48:06.680]  Petrovna Blavatsky and she really believed the superiority of the Aryan
[2:48:06.680 --> 2:48:11.440]  race and it was her writing specifically in the secret doctrine the theosophic
[2:48:11.440 --> 2:48:16.960]  society Hitler followed her absolutely in fact that's why Hitler embraced these
[2:48:16.960 --> 2:48:22.180]  of these Aryan superiority concepts because he was the disciple of
[2:48:22.180 --> 2:48:28.040]  Polita Petrovna Blavatsky and simply in every major city in America today there's
[2:48:28.040 --> 2:48:32.200]  a metaphysical bookstore and you'll always have the liberals and then you'll
[2:48:32.200 --> 2:48:35.640]  confront him with Margaret Sanger or you'll confront him with Blavatsky and
[2:48:35.640 --> 2:48:37.880]  they'll and they'll kind of get your side and go that's right you son of a
[2:48:37.880 --> 2:48:42.200]  bitch we're gonna get you soon you know they'll have this friendly little hi oh
[2:48:42.200 --> 2:48:46.200]  nice but behind my scenes it's we've got to exterminate the blacks and the
[2:48:46.200 --> 2:48:50.760]  Mexicans I mean you know it's like social services break up their families
[2:48:50.760 --> 2:48:54.200]  get them in the inner cities and the blacks are just dancing right into the
[2:48:54.200 --> 2:48:59.040]  gas chambers basically well you know basically of course there's so many
[2:48:59.040 --> 2:49:04.480]  ways that the blacks are under attack today and statistics show that oh if
[2:49:04.480 --> 2:49:09.760]  you're a blood young black man between the age of 21 and 31 one in every three
[2:49:09.760 --> 2:49:14.680]  is either in probate prove it but probably in probation or parole or in
[2:49:14.680 --> 2:49:18.520]  prison I mean how could you possibly do something like that well I'll tell you
[2:49:18.520 --> 2:49:23.720]  how they could do it and it is the water fluoridation and there's a man back at
[2:49:23.720 --> 2:49:29.560]  Dartmouth named of Roger Masters he's a he's into into psychology and why the
[2:49:29.560 --> 2:49:33.920]  people act the way they did and actually he's written is wonderful guest if you
[2:49:33.920 --> 2:49:38.800]  never get him on I'm sure it'd be a good guess for you but basically he found
[2:49:38.800 --> 2:49:43.560]  that and there are studies which which he quotes extensively that in the areas
[2:49:43.560 --> 2:49:48.040]  where they fluoridate the water and they use hydrofluosalistic acid that's used
[2:49:48.040 --> 2:49:52.320]  in 90 to 95 percent of the communities where they do water fluoridation and
[2:49:52.320 --> 2:49:57.520]  of course the hydrofluosalistic acid contains lead arsenic, polonium 220 and
[2:49:57.520 --> 2:50:02.520]  fluoride it is a waste product it's a deadly poison it's actually they have
[2:50:02.520 --> 2:50:06.600]  especially in line trucks to truck it into your community to fluoridate your
[2:50:06.600 --> 2:50:11.880]  water but in the areas where they did that and then they measured the level of
[2:50:11.880 --> 2:50:17.400]  lead in the blood of children why the kind of black children at six times the
[2:50:17.400 --> 2:50:21.000]  level of lead. Stay there we're gonna skip this break right now for the info
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:25.360]  wards.com streams and prisonplanet.tv members everybody else will be right back
[2:50:25.360 --> 2:50:34.800]  now doc doc this is the big issue is that it is a fact that the Germans and
[2:50:34.800 --> 2:50:38.400]  the Soviets put it in the water it's in Pulitzer prize-winning books they knew
[2:50:38.400 --> 2:50:41.480]  what it would do and that's the point that's why the head dentist who got
[2:50:41.480 --> 2:50:45.640]  Canada fluoridated as you know for ten years has been apologizing he thought
[2:50:45.640 --> 2:50:50.800]  it was calcium fluoride they were putting in no it is this grignard heavy
[2:50:50.800 --> 2:50:56.720]  metal byproduct of aluminum and fertilizer purification as you know but
[2:50:56.720 --> 2:51:00.520]  for the audience and they put it in the water with the heavy metals so it's not
[2:51:00.520 --> 2:51:05.240]  just the fluoride it's the lead please continue for the viewers out there all
[2:51:05.240 --> 2:51:09.240]  right well it's important that people understand that according to Roger
[2:51:09.240 --> 2:51:15.720]  Masters the Dartmouth when they've checked and they do this on 450,000
[2:51:15.720 --> 2:51:19.200]  children they wanted to be sure what a good job they were doing but they did
[2:51:19.200 --> 2:51:25.000]  this on 450,000 children they did finger sticks they measured the level of lead
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:30.600]  in the up eye in the blood and if you were black you're into the year level of
[2:51:30.600 --> 2:51:35.680]  blood of lead in the blood went up six times Hispanic four times white it
[2:51:35.680 --> 2:51:41.560]  doubled now why is that significant because lead causes a pathological
[2:51:41.560 --> 2:51:46.680]  behavior it causes rage and anger and criminal behavior and it is the lead
[2:51:46.680 --> 2:51:52.400]  intoxication of the vast majority of blacks in our country are the leading
[2:51:52.400 --> 2:51:57.080]  person is black you know criminal activity and by the way they knew this
[2:51:57.080 --> 2:52:03.360]  they knew this in 1800 1805 Napoleon they would give less aggressive troops a
[2:52:03.360 --> 2:52:08.080]  a tincture of lead saying it got the blood up and made a more aggressive so
[2:52:08.080 --> 2:52:11.960]  again a lot of this has been known for hundreds of years and they're doing this
[2:52:11.960 --> 2:52:15.080]  to the blacks in America today and the fact that most people have never heard
[2:52:15.080 --> 2:52:19.200]  of this we do have interviews several interviews with Roger Masters it's so
[2:52:19.200 --> 2:52:22.840]  vitally important if you care about your black brothers and sisters and yes
[2:52:22.840 --> 2:52:26.520]  Hispanic brothers and sisters understand they're poisoning them with water
[2:52:26.520 --> 2:52:30.600]  pardon me with water fluoridation they know exactly they've done studies
[2:52:30.600 --> 2:52:34.760]  magically the cities are diverting stronger Florida areas to worse parts of
[2:52:34.760 --> 2:52:41.280]  town I mean folks this is so diabolical we just want to warn people but instead
[2:52:41.280 --> 2:52:44.120]  the Mexicans want to run around waving Mexican flags screaming we're gonna get
[2:52:44.120 --> 2:52:49.160]  Larry Conquista your leaders your foundation owned La Raza Mecha and
[2:52:49.160 --> 2:52:54.240]  others aren't gonna tell you we are going to tell you unbelievable and I
[2:52:54.240 --> 2:52:59.000]  think it's so important that the people in La Raza and I mentioned and they
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:04.240]  understand that these organizations are funded by the Ford Foundation and for
[2:53:04.240 --> 2:53:08.640]  Henry Ford was involved with the Ossofie and of course with this whole
[2:53:08.640 --> 2:53:11.760]  satanic movement that's why they're doing what they're doing and we can find
[2:53:11.760 --> 2:53:15.440]  similar connections to the Carnegie Foundation and that's how people get
[2:53:15.440 --> 2:53:18.440]  confused that's how they get confused I want to talk about that in the final
[2:53:18.440 --> 2:53:21.760]  segment but doc is there a time schedule when I get you for two hours there on
[2:53:21.760 --> 2:53:26.040]  the show oh sure there is but not today I'm flying out no no I understand that
[2:53:26.040 --> 2:53:29.800]  that's what I'm saying next week would be love to be I'm gonna have trays back
[2:53:29.800 --> 2:53:33.400]  in Monday I'm gonna have him call you two hours next week we got five final
[2:53:33.400 --> 2:53:44.680]  minutes here we go for those that weren't listening on the info wars.com
[2:53:44.680 --> 2:53:47.960]  streams on the M&M dial he went into how the blacks have five times the lead
[2:53:47.960 --> 2:53:53.400]  Hispanics three to four times what whites do they're pumping it directly into
[2:53:53.400 --> 2:53:58.360]  you through the sodium fluoride preparation this is an absolute fact
[2:53:58.360 --> 2:54:04.120]  you're under attack mayor puts the age virus in your shots it's mainstream news
[2:54:04.120 --> 2:54:07.360]  people all that's not true you think I'd be on the air you think they'd sue me if
[2:54:07.360 --> 2:54:12.960]  that wasn't true you're under attack I know it's scary folks every night I have
[2:54:12.960 --> 2:54:15.360]  to deal with them that they may kill me they're threatening to kill me and my
[2:54:15.360 --> 2:54:20.600]  family I still go on air because I have a responsibility if I know this to warn
[2:54:20.600 --> 2:54:26.440]  you they fund your Mecha your La Raza your NAACP that's how they control the
[2:54:26.440 --> 2:54:31.120]  Republicans all this stupid Republican Democrat diversion there is a
[2:54:31.120 --> 2:54:36.600]  worldwide eugenics state waging war against us all Dr. Monteef closing
[2:54:36.600 --> 2:54:40.120]  information about the New World Order other attack patterns they're launching
[2:54:40.120 --> 2:54:46.280]  on us. Well I fear very much with their link it was open for a nuclear war with
[2:54:46.280 --> 2:54:52.040]  the Muslim world that gets into civil admin story the tenor files and of
[2:54:52.040 --> 2:54:57.480]  course you can get that on the internet just but actually Google in the civil
[2:54:57.480 --> 2:55:02.920]  admins and the tenor files and you'll find that there was a spiring operating
[2:55:02.920 --> 2:55:06.400]  at the highest level of our government with the full knowledge of the people
[2:55:06.400 --> 2:55:10.880]  who control our state department the FBI and their funding also to nuclear
[2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:16.280]  technology and material they need to build nuclear weapons. Now again I
[2:55:16.280 --> 2:55:19.760]  wouldn't call it because you know we have FBI agents saying it's like Al Qaeda
[2:55:19.760 --> 2:55:24.520]  ran the FBI it's not like that is it you know they call it rogue elements but
[2:55:24.520 --> 2:55:28.360]  these are the real capstones of the pyramidal power structures. They're not
[2:55:28.360 --> 2:55:33.000]  allowed to investigate or reveal this but the significance I think everybody's
[2:55:33.000 --> 2:55:38.400]  really missed why would we be funneling nuclear information to build nuclear
[2:55:38.400 --> 2:55:43.480]  weapons to the Pakistanis very obvious they want a nuclear war and that'll
[2:55:43.480 --> 2:55:47.960]  really be a wonderful wonderful way for population control I hate to even
[2:55:47.960 --> 2:55:52.680]  consider this but this is absolutely what why do you think the West snuck
[2:55:52.680 --> 2:55:57.360]  attack Russia three weeks ago? Well this was the stupidest thing in the world
[2:55:57.360 --> 2:56:00.880]  unless of course you want to draw Russia and China into a war with America
[2:56:00.880 --> 2:56:05.000]  people say it can't happen I think it's going to happen and I think if God is
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:08.840]  just he's going to bring judgment on this nation. We got some bold people they'll
[2:56:08.840 --> 2:56:13.560]  fly remote control airplanes into the towers folks they're not playing games
[2:56:13.560 --> 2:56:17.680]  that's one thing about these Luciferians doctor they are bold aren't they? They
[2:56:17.680 --> 2:56:21.480]  certainly are and of course they are succeeding because the good people are
[2:56:21.480 --> 2:56:25.520]  not taking a stand and God is allowing this to happen but one of these days is
[2:56:25.520 --> 2:56:29.240]  going to intervene and and I tremble for my country when I consider what's going
[2:56:29.240 --> 2:56:33.640]  to happen doc let's look at your book right now here live on air I think I
[2:56:33.640 --> 2:56:37.360]  got two big guests next week so there's a low chance I'm in a movie of one day's
[2:56:37.360 --> 2:56:40.680]  blocked out in a month what day next week you want to do two hours I'm live
[2:56:40.680 --> 2:56:44.680]  11 I have the slightest idea just have trade give me a call we'll be glad to
[2:56:44.680 --> 2:56:49.680]  work to get something I want to do a whole hour on eugenics and a whole
[2:56:49.680 --> 2:56:53.160]  thing on the Sybil Edmonds and the nukes dr. Montee for radio liberty calm
[2:56:53.160 --> 2:56:56.720]  thanks for spending time with us it's always the pleasure God bless thanks to
[2:56:56.720 --> 2:56:59.640]  myself you bet thank you before I end this segment and come back with Mark

[2:57:15.760 --> 2:57:19.520]  sold out to the global system shit at the highest levels continuity of
[2:57:19.520 --> 2:57:23.520]  government in this nation is run by multi-nationals it's private there's
[2:57:23.520 --> 2:57:27.280]  been a corporate takeover of our government first they federalize then
[2:57:27.280 --> 2:57:32.320]  they take over the federal government through continuity of government
[2:57:32.320 --> 2:57:35.360]  systems they do it in Brazil they do it in England they do it in Germany they
[2:57:35.360 --> 2:57:39.440]  do it in the u.s. this is how they rule and fabled enemies covers all of that

[2:57:56.240 --> 2:58:00.680]  act of defiance I think we should have a debate about being exterminated and

[3:02:02.400 --> 3:02:06.400]  about two three minutes left I want to go back to Aaron now Aaron finish up
[3:02:06.400 --> 3:02:09.760]  with your other points on eugenics was going to rapid-fire a Margaret Singer
[3:02:09.760 --> 3:02:13.600]  quote and then finally a Richard Dawkins quote Margaret singer the most
[3:02:13.600 --> 3:02:17.680]  merciful thing a family does to one of its infant members is to kill it birth
[3:02:17.680 --> 3:02:22.880]  control must lead ultimately to a cleaner race eugenics sterilization is an urgent
[3:02:22.880 --> 3:02:27.560]  need we must prevent multiplication of this bad stock eugenics is the most
[3:02:27.560 --> 3:02:31.880]  adequate and thorough avenue to solution of racial political and social
[3:02:31.880 --> 3:02:36.880]  problems and then Richard Dawkins has this kind of open thought of what if
[3:02:36.880 --> 3:02:42.240]  eugenics came back in the 1920s and 1930 scientists from both the political left
[3:02:42.240 --> 3:02:46.120]  and right would not have found the idea of designer babies particularly dangerous
[3:02:46.120 --> 3:02:50.520]  though of course they would not have used that phrase today I suspect that the
[3:02:50.520 --> 3:02:54.400]  idea is too dangerous for comfortable discussion and my conjecture is that
[3:02:54.400 --> 3:02:58.120]  Adolf Hitler is responsible for the change nobody wants to be caught
[3:02:58.120 --> 3:03:02.440]  agreeing with that monster even in a single particular the specter of Hitler
[3:03:02.440 --> 3:03:07.400]  has led some scientists to stray from odd to is and deny that breeding for human
[3:03:07.400 --> 3:03:11.640]  qualities is even possible but if you can breed cattle for milk horses for
[3:03:11.640 --> 3:03:16.400]  speed dogs for skill why shouldn't you breed humans for mathematical musical or
[3:03:16.400 --> 3:03:21.920]  athletic ability I wonder some 60 years after Hitler's death why we might at
[3:03:21.920 --> 3:03:25.200]  least venture to ask what the moral difference is between breeding for
[3:03:25.200 --> 3:03:28.560]  musical ability and the problem is with breeding you're talking about
[3:03:28.560 --> 3:03:31.480]  exterminating most of the puppies or kittens that are born you're talking
[3:03:31.480 --> 3:03:35.560]  about the state having this incredible control and in special breed you get more
[3:03:35.560 --> 3:03:40.240]  mental illness more inherited diseases and the elites that enter bread most
[3:03:40.240 --> 3:03:44.520]  of their children were born retarded or had serious mental illness problems but
[3:03:44.520 --> 3:03:49.160]  do they give up this system of control no they only intensified it down
[3:03:49.160 --> 3:03:54.120]  throughout the last hundred plus years and now they're practicing their eugenics
[3:03:54.120 --> 3:03:57.560]  upon us through the vaccines through the chemtrails through the entire system
[3:03:57.560 --> 3:04:00.560]  Aaron I want to have you back up in a couple weeks again for a whole nother

[3:06:35.600 --> 3:06:38.560]  length here recently and she was talking about the great depression we're
[3:06:38.560 --> 3:06:42.440]  talking about the gas prices the food prices this economic uncertainty we're
[3:06:42.440 --> 3:06:45.240]  in these you know really kind of perilous times no one knows where we're
[3:06:45.240 --> 3:06:48.360]  headed or where we might end up she was remind step noski there
[3:06:48.360 --> 3:06:51.800]  yep he's still there folks who lived in the country did okay because they had
[3:06:51.800 --> 3:06:54.520]  chicken and eggs and they can grow gardens and can their food but how
[3:06:54.520 --> 3:06:57.880]  difficult it was for people who lived in urban areas or in the cities because
[3:06:57.880 --> 3:07:00.680]  they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how they didn't
[3:07:00.680 --> 3:07:03.960]  have the chickens in the livestock so it's a lot different for them well we
[3:07:03.960 --> 3:07:07.240]  know one thing certain right now we're headed into much higher prices on food

[3:09:22.360 --> 3:09:26.000]  doctors and lawyers and people and they don't need to be swat teamed mark step
[3:09:26.000 --> 3:09:30.680]  noski i really appreciate you coming on with us today thanks alex it's good to
[3:09:30.680 --> 3:09:33.600]  be on with you today you're gonna be with us for the next fifty minutes at the
[3:09:33.600 --> 3:09:36.680]  bottom of the hour we're gonna open the phones up at one eight hundred two five
[3:09:36.680 --> 3:09:40.520]  at nine nine two three one the last ten months or so that you were on with us a
[3:09:40.520 --> 3:09:45.880]  lot has happened top italian former presidents german defense ministers
[3:09:45.880 --> 3:09:52.080]  japanese diet members the best actress so many prominent people have gone
[3:09:52.080 --> 3:09:55.880]  public for nine eleven truth give us your take on the evolution of it and why
[3:09:55.880 --> 3:09:59.320]  nine eleven truth is so important why you took the step of speaking out mark
[3:09:59.320 --> 3:10:04.600]  yeah i think it's great to see you know like you said as time goes on more and
[3:10:04.600 --> 3:10:08.840]  more people are coming forward as they gradually become aware of the facts
[3:10:08.840 --> 3:10:13.960]  um... obviously you know through online research and through the amount of books
[3:10:13.960 --> 3:10:18.160]  and magazines that have come out now you know enough enough authors have come
[3:10:18.160 --> 3:10:23.400]  forward stated their opinion and i think what's really important now is
[3:10:23.400 --> 3:10:29.840]  obviously people early on shortly after the nine eleven attacks were
[3:10:29.840 --> 3:10:35.440]  kind of pigeonholed as conspiracy theorists but now that label it never
[3:10:35.440 --> 3:10:39.560]  did apply but it's it's less applicable now than ever
[3:10:39.560 --> 3:10:43.360]  simply because the the people who are coming out in favor of nine eleven
[3:10:43.360 --> 3:10:46.680]  truth are too credible to to ignore
[3:10:46.680 --> 3:10:50.600]  uh... you know in the last few years we've had the formation of things like
[3:10:50.600 --> 3:10:53.080]  scholars for nine eleven truth
[3:10:53.080 --> 3:10:57.520]  which includes architects and engineers for nine eleven truth
[3:10:57.520 --> 3:11:02.880]  uh... pilots for nine eleven truth we have uh... former uh... people who work
[3:11:02.880 --> 3:11:06.720]  in government that including the current administration who are coming out and
[3:11:06.720 --> 3:11:09.680]  saying that they don't believe the official story
[3:11:09.680 --> 3:11:13.680]  so it's just a case of you know as more people become exposed to it as the
[3:11:13.680 --> 3:11:17.720]  media blackout uh... in mainstream media continues
[3:11:17.720 --> 3:11:21.960]  uh... mostly the internet people are becoming connected and becoming aware
[3:11:21.960 --> 3:11:24.280]  these facts and voicing their opinion
[3:11:24.280 --> 3:11:29.880]  uh... it's very encouraging to see uh... you know it's it's never too late
[3:11:29.880 --> 3:11:34.280]  for anybody who feels strongly about this issue to come forward and voice
[3:11:34.280 --> 3:11:37.080]  their opinion because uh... i think
[3:11:37.080 --> 3:11:42.240]  the time goes on people will be surprised to find out that
[3:11:42.240 --> 3:11:45.760]  if they are no longer worried about expressing their skepticism of the
[3:11:45.760 --> 3:11:48.040]  official story regarding nine eleven
[3:11:48.040 --> 3:11:52.000]  they will find out that there are a lot of people out there uh... you might
[3:11:52.000 --> 3:11:57.400]  refer to them as a silent majority who also feel very much the same way
[3:11:57.400 --> 3:11:58.560]  they are either
[3:11:58.560 --> 3:12:00.520]  too afraid or
[3:12:00.520 --> 3:12:06.360]  too reluctant to come forward and also express their doubts the official story
[3:12:06.360 --> 3:12:08.840]  what made you go public i mean what made you do
[3:12:08.840 --> 3:12:11.560]  i mean you were one of them you know first you know prominent
[3:12:11.560 --> 3:12:13.360]  uh... sports figures
[3:12:13.360 --> 3:12:17.320]  uh... to go public uh... i mean now willy nelson's gone public
[3:12:17.320 --> 3:12:19.920]  uh... jesse ventura has gone public
[3:12:19.920 --> 3:12:22.800]  i mean it's just it's it's just exponential but but
[3:12:22.800 --> 3:12:26.360]  what made you decide to take that leap
[3:12:26.360 --> 3:12:27.960]  i just uh...
[3:12:27.960 --> 3:12:33.000]  you know it it i got tired of waiting for for the the channels of government
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:33.680]  to
[3:12:33.680 --> 3:12:35.840]  move along in a proper fashion
[3:12:35.840 --> 3:12:36.920]  uh...
[3:12:36.920 --> 3:12:39.280]  you know like a lot of people i had
[3:12:39.280 --> 3:12:40.400]  uh... hope
[3:12:40.400 --> 3:12:42.600]  uh... it turns out to be false hope
[3:12:42.600 --> 3:12:46.040]  uh... in retrospect but i have hope at the time that
[3:12:46.040 --> 3:12:49.000]  you know maybe nine eleven commission would be legitimate
[3:12:49.000 --> 3:12:51.560]  uh... you know maybe
[3:12:51.560 --> 3:12:55.480]  you know the safeguards are in place and in constitutional government i thought
[3:12:55.480 --> 3:12:57.200]  that they would kick in
[3:12:57.200 --> 3:13:01.680]  and operate in the manner in which they're supposed to and we would
[3:13:01.680 --> 3:13:08.360]  uh... proper investigation you know with with relevant witnesses and
[3:13:08.360 --> 3:13:09.400]  evidence
[3:13:09.400 --> 3:13:11.680]  and as we all know
[3:13:11.680 --> 3:13:15.960]  none of that really came to fruition the nine eleven uh... commission was a
[3:13:15.960 --> 3:13:18.520]  sham there was a cover up there was
[3:13:18.520 --> 3:13:23.400]  a modern-day version of the war in commission as far as it's attempt to
[3:13:23.400 --> 3:13:27.920]  silence witnesses and suppressed truth tellers
[3:13:27.920 --> 3:13:29.840]  and you know when things
[3:13:29.840 --> 3:13:35.560]  reached that point and that commission uh... was shown to be the impotent
[3:13:35.560 --> 3:13:37.600]  vehicle that was
[3:13:37.600 --> 3:13:42.240]  i just felt compelled to my own small way for whatever i could uh...
[3:13:42.240 --> 3:13:46.400]  as far as what i thought the truth was well mark mark that isn't in your own
[3:13:46.400 --> 3:13:49.160]  small way uh... you know it's not just that
[3:13:49.160 --> 3:13:52.400]  you're a you know celebrity or a well-known sports figure
[3:13:52.400 --> 3:13:55.680]  it's that people resonate with the courage of a willy nelson or a mark
[3:13:55.680 --> 3:13:59.560]  stepp noski or a former you know german defense minister
[3:13:59.560 --> 3:14:03.240]  uh... or a former governor they resonate
[3:14:03.240 --> 3:14:06.560]  and and and and they know that person has a lot to lose that person's going to be
[3:14:06.560 --> 3:14:09.640]  demonized this person is really stepping up
[3:14:09.640 --> 3:14:13.200]  and so that's what makes you and so many others that stood up and on public
[3:14:13.200 --> 3:14:15.840]  uh... heroes but look at the vindication
[3:14:15.840 --> 3:14:17.560]  was a cargo tribune
[3:14:17.560 --> 3:14:22.160]  four months ago reported as well as associated press the ns a declassified
[3:14:22.160 --> 3:14:25.280]  that israel did attack the u s this liberty to try to sink it
[3:14:25.280 --> 3:14:29.200]  to blame it on the egypt to start world war three as they've now tried to the
[3:14:29.200 --> 3:14:31.120]  u s is tried in georgia
[3:14:31.120 --> 3:14:35.120]  uh... it's now come out side her should be media event and he did admit new yorker
[3:14:35.120 --> 3:14:36.640]  magazine that shaney
[3:14:36.640 --> 3:14:42.360]  he just said a stage provocation he said this is the provocation to have u s uh...
[3:14:42.360 --> 3:14:46.560]  navy seals dressed up like iranians on blue pt boats
[3:14:46.560 --> 3:14:49.680]  uh... tack u s ships in the street or moose
[3:14:49.680 --> 3:14:50.800]  uh... so
[3:14:50.800 --> 3:14:54.280]  government sponsored terror the fact that all the time can be staged
[3:14:54.280 --> 3:14:56.160]  that's all coming out now
[3:14:56.160 --> 3:14:59.400]  and people say well that was seven years ago you know nine eleven why are you so
[3:14:59.400 --> 3:15:00.160]  concerned
[3:15:00.160 --> 3:15:01.680]  well because
[3:15:01.680 --> 3:15:04.160]  black ops is going to continue
[3:15:04.160 --> 3:15:06.020]  to stage terror attacks
[3:15:06.020 --> 3:15:07.840]  as a pretext for control
[3:15:07.840 --> 3:15:13.120]  if we don't step up and expose it there behind it mark your comments on that
[3:15:13.120 --> 3:15:18.480]  yeah i entirely agree uh... it's it's been a steady progression it's it's been
[3:15:18.480 --> 3:15:23.200]  you know just just one incident after another we saw last year where uh...
[3:15:23.200 --> 3:15:26.960]  bush and tony blare had the plan to uh...
[3:15:26.960 --> 3:15:32.160]  and u s military planes over iran disguised as u n planes
[3:15:32.160 --> 3:15:37.600]  to try and instigate an attack on them so we would be justified in responding
[3:15:37.600 --> 3:15:38.480]  uh...
[3:15:38.480 --> 3:15:43.160]  where i remember also last year's a big new brzezinski uh... appearing uh... in
[3:15:43.160 --> 3:15:44.680]  the press
[3:15:44.680 --> 3:15:49.080]  practically coming right out of saying you know we had to worry about
[3:15:49.080 --> 3:15:51.960]  that the current administration
[3:15:51.960 --> 3:15:56.760]  putting together a false flag terror opted stimulate war with iran
[3:15:56.760 --> 3:15:58.880]  this is a guy who is now
[3:15:58.880 --> 3:16:02.680]  uh... brock obama's main foreign policy advisor
[3:16:02.680 --> 3:16:04.800]  so again we have these people coming out
[3:16:04.800 --> 3:16:09.800]  you know it in in mainstream media within the last year with these uh...
[3:16:09.800 --> 3:16:12.000]  you know scenarios that have come and gone
[3:16:12.000 --> 3:16:15.080]  that that involved fall flag terror
[3:16:15.080 --> 3:16:18.360]  so i just think in this day and age people are are becoming a little bit
[3:16:18.360 --> 3:16:22.400]  uh... a little bit too hip to what's going on they understand ahead of time
[3:16:22.400 --> 3:16:26.560]  similar happened in spain when you have the fall flag terror attack there uh...
[3:16:26.560 --> 3:16:30.120]  with the train the people in days came out in the hundreds of thousands and said
[3:16:30.120 --> 3:16:33.720]  we know you did it and turned out it was the intelligence operation
[3:16:33.720 --> 3:16:38.320]  exactly hopefully we're reaching that point now in north america you know so
[3:16:38.320 --> 3:16:42.080]  we could call critical mass whatever you want to but
[3:16:42.080 --> 3:16:43.720]  hopefully through you know
[3:16:43.720 --> 3:16:48.360]  the the work that you do and uh... statements made by nine eleven truthers
[3:16:48.360 --> 3:16:52.720]  like myself and and and the many others around the world you know we have people
[3:16:52.720 --> 3:16:57.440]  uh... a politician in japanese parlor came out wanting to have a another
[3:16:57.440 --> 3:16:59.000]  investigation
[3:16:59.000 --> 3:17:04.120]  uh... we're having a march uh... in canada to ottawa to culminate on
[3:17:04.120 --> 3:17:07.040]  september eleventh uh... where they're going to present
[3:17:07.040 --> 3:17:11.440]  a petition at parliament hill for a new right and i love an investigation in
[3:17:11.440 --> 3:17:13.000]  canada
[3:17:13.000 --> 3:17:16.920]  so i think you know worldwide you're seeing people come around and you know
[3:17:16.920 --> 3:17:21.160]  waking up to the fact that this was a fall flag operation you know to have a
[3:17:21.160 --> 3:17:24.960]  certain effect on the american public the question now is
[3:17:24.960 --> 3:17:28.200]  you know all are the people who live in america going to be
[3:17:28.200 --> 3:17:30.840]  smart enough to
[3:17:30.840 --> 3:17:35.240]  look into the right sources of information to kind of emancipate
[3:17:35.240 --> 3:17:39.320]  themselves from this from this media blackout that's going on
[3:17:39.320 --> 3:17:40.720]  i think of people
[3:17:40.720 --> 3:17:42.680]  they'll continue to
[3:17:42.680 --> 3:17:44.600]  turn off the tv's
[3:17:44.600 --> 3:17:48.720]  give less uh... credence to mainstream media corporate media
[3:17:48.720 --> 3:17:54.760]  and instead you know read online read books uh... read magazines
[3:17:54.760 --> 3:17:59.000]  uh... anything out there that's going to give a true story of nine eleven
[3:17:59.000 --> 3:18:00.120]  troops
[3:18:00.120 --> 3:18:01.000]  uh...
[3:18:01.000 --> 3:18:05.240]  this is what's going to mobilize the population in america so that
[3:18:05.240 --> 3:18:08.960]  when another fall flag terrorist attack occurs
[3:18:08.960 --> 3:18:13.960]  whatever it is whether it's bio terror whether it's a mini nuke somewhere
[3:18:13.960 --> 3:18:17.600]  uh... people will see it for what it is
[3:18:17.600 --> 3:18:22.520]  not be railroaded into a certain mindset like they were after nine eleven
[3:18:22.520 --> 3:18:26.360]  we're talking to super bowl champion uh... two-time mark stepp noski five
[3:18:26.360 --> 3:18:28.640]  at time
[3:18:28.640 --> 3:18:29.720]  pro bowler
[3:18:29.720 --> 3:18:33.840]  and he's again going public and not because it's fun but because it's his
[3:18:33.840 --> 3:18:38.000]  duty and i would venture to say because he just said it he knows that if we
[3:18:38.000 --> 3:18:41.120]  don't expose the tool of false flag that mechanism
[3:18:41.120 --> 3:18:44.840]  uh... this military industrial complex is going to keep doing it to hurt us
[3:18:44.840 --> 3:18:49.000]  just like in in england how they hunt facets they beat pots and pans they have
[3:18:49.000 --> 3:18:53.160]  beaters who push the birds out in a wedge so the hunters can shoot them when
[3:18:53.160 --> 3:18:54.400]  they get driven out
[3:18:54.400 --> 3:18:57.320]  that's the same thing you want to attack iran you want to attack iraq you
[3:18:57.320 --> 3:18:58.560]  stage an event
[3:18:58.560 --> 3:19:02.680]  you want to attack egypt you stage an event they've been caught over and over
[3:19:02.680 --> 3:19:04.000]  and
[3:19:04.000 --> 3:19:07.320]  they're gonna continue to do this if we don't expose it
[3:19:07.320 --> 3:19:09.000]  and that's why
[3:19:09.000 --> 3:19:10.480]  the courage
[3:19:10.480 --> 3:19:11.600]  of
[3:19:11.600 --> 3:19:14.920]  now thousands of prominent people that have gone public for nine eleven truth
[3:19:14.920 --> 3:19:17.720]  and now all these architecture engineers and physicists
[3:19:17.720 --> 3:19:19.960]  is unstoppable we're gonna come back and talk about
[3:19:19.960 --> 3:19:23.040]  the fraudulent new nist report with mark stipnosky
[3:19:23.040 --> 3:19:24.720]  and then we're gonna take your phone calls

[3:23:52.520 --> 3:23:57.640]  around watching the Cowboys play rooting for Mark and now I'm rooting for
[3:23:57.640 --> 3:24:01.240]  him in a much more important way and that is his courage speaking out for
[3:24:01.240 --> 3:24:05.520]  911 true there's ballot initiative in New York to get a new investigation going
[3:24:05.520 --> 3:24:09.440]  or expose that a grand jury there's a lot of different initiatives there's
[3:24:09.440 --> 3:24:13.680]  marches going on events coming up in New York next week that I hope folks go to
[3:24:13.680 --> 3:24:19.440]  and let's let's talk about that ballot initiative first and then I want to get
[3:24:19.440 --> 3:24:23.960]  into the NIST report Mark yeah obviously you know since we're coming up on the
[3:24:23.960 --> 3:24:28.480]  anniversary of 9-11 there's a lot of activities going around to highlight the
[3:24:28.480 --> 3:24:33.680]  fact that the official story is untrue one of those is in New York City it's a
[3:24:33.680 --> 3:24:39.360]  9-11 ballot initiative this is a way for I mean it's obvious that like I said
[3:24:39.360 --> 3:24:44.160]  earlier that we're not going to get a proper investigation through government
[3:24:44.160 --> 3:24:48.920]  channels but this is a way for the people of New York City to create a new
[3:24:48.920 --> 3:24:54.960]  9-11 Commission an investigation of the events which would have subpoena power
[3:24:54.960 --> 3:25:00.400]  it would have some legal authority volunteers in New York City been going
[3:25:00.400 --> 3:25:04.800]  around getting signatures on petitions they needed a minimum of 30,000 which
[3:25:04.800 --> 3:25:10.480]  they just recently achieved so that was great news and now these petitions will
[3:25:10.480 --> 3:25:16.440]  be submitted to the New York City clerk and New York City Council and with the
[3:25:16.440 --> 3:25:22.400]  with a sufficient amount of signatures this being above 30,000 they will be
[3:25:22.400 --> 3:25:28.840]  able to present this and then it can become an issue a topic on the ballot I
[3:25:28.840 --> 3:25:35.760]  believe it would be part of the 2009 ballot for mayor the election of mayor
[3:25:35.760 --> 3:25:41.320]  in New York City where citizens can vote for themselves they can make their
[3:25:41.320 --> 3:25:47.360]  voices heard that they think it is necessary as citizens of that city as
[3:25:47.360 --> 3:25:52.120]  voters of New York City to demand a new investigation one that actually has some
[3:25:52.120 --> 3:25:59.440]  teeth absolutely and it shouldn't just be New York we need lots of grand jury
[3:25:59.440 --> 3:26:03.560]  you know type public investigations both governmental non-governmental to draw
[3:26:03.560 --> 3:26:08.680]  this out publicly and continue to expose it everything is a step to use a
[3:26:08.680 --> 3:26:13.120]  football analogy you know for more yards to get a new set of downs towards the
[3:26:13.120 --> 3:26:17.280]  touchdown bringing these criminals to justice and even if we never bring them
[3:26:17.280 --> 3:26:22.000]  to quote justice by sending them to prison by publicly convicting them in
[3:26:22.000 --> 3:26:25.720]  the court of public opinion and by educating the public about false flag
[3:26:25.720 --> 3:26:30.880]  terrorism it breaks that tool that the black ops continue to use mark your
[3:26:30.880 --> 3:26:35.800]  take on that yeah without a doubt it's it's all a question of you know just
[3:26:35.800 --> 3:26:40.800]  mobilizing the masses I think a lot of people fall into a defeatist attitude of
[3:26:40.800 --> 3:26:44.520]  you know what what can I do what well how can I make a difference I'm only one
[3:26:44.520 --> 3:26:49.400]  person well just by signing that petition just by signing your name on that
[3:26:49.400 --> 3:26:54.200]  piece of paper you are in effect saying look I don't believe in what the
[3:26:54.200 --> 3:26:58.440]  government is telling me I don't believe the lies that I'm being told in
[3:26:58.440 --> 3:27:03.840]  corporate media you know I demand a new investigation this is one way for people
[3:27:03.840 --> 3:27:09.120]  to have their voice heard people who otherwise might feel powerless there's a
[3:27:09.120 --> 3:27:14.040]  lot of people in New York City if a lot of them mobilize it might be surprising
[3:27:14.040 --> 3:27:19.040]  what could actually happen but you know I urge listeners of your show who either
[3:27:19.040 --> 3:27:23.240]  live in New York City or have family or friends there to let them know about
[3:27:23.240 --> 3:27:32.120]  this they can look it up on the WWW dot NYC 9-11 initiative org and find out
[3:27:32.120 --> 3:27:37.440]  anything they would like to about this movement but I think that you know right
[3:27:37.440 --> 3:27:41.680]  now it's moving along very nicely and should it succeed in any degree it'll
[3:27:41.680 --> 3:27:45.240]  be a big step forward it really could be a breakthrough and a lot of people have
[3:27:45.240 --> 3:27:49.440]  this loser mentality of all will never be corruption oh there's no point
[3:27:49.440 --> 3:27:52.520]  ladies and gentlemen we don't have a choice number one number two we're
[3:27:52.520 --> 3:27:56.040]  actually having an effect the majority of Americans and major polls believe
[3:27:56.040 --> 3:27:59.960]  there's a 9-11 cover-up there's hundreds of these polls we're having an effect
[3:27:59.960 --> 3:28:04.280]  look how far we've come from myself two months before the attacks saying I think
[3:28:04.280 --> 3:28:07.000]  they're going to attack the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset
[3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:10.680]  bin Laden because I saw them preparing the public introducing bin Laden I knew
[3:28:10.680 --> 3:28:14.160]  their past history I knew the FBI had cooked a bomb trained the driver given
[3:28:14.160 --> 3:28:20.160]  the detonators block local police in 93 with the first attack I mean again look
[3:28:20.160 --> 3:28:25.360]  how far we've come from 9-11 that first day look how far we've come thanks to
[3:28:25.360 --> 3:28:30.280]  people like Mark Stipnowski, Willie Nelson, Governor Ventura, Stephen Jones
[3:28:30.280 --> 3:28:35.160]  now now I'm going to skip this break for M4Wars.com we'll be back in
[3:28:35.160 --> 3:28:38.720]  three minutes but because I don't want to waste any time that we've got with
[3:28:38.720 --> 3:28:43.520]  Mark Stipnowski today but Mark that NIST report they delayed it three years the
[3:28:43.520 --> 3:28:47.840]  people on the government NIST board are involved in explosive thermite research
[3:28:47.840 --> 3:28:52.000]  their experts they're involved in government contracts and then they had
[3:28:52.000 --> 3:28:59.200]  to pull back they had to say okay our last five reasons for the towers falling
[3:28:59.200 --> 3:29:03.560]  and building 7 falling are wrong it's not fuel oil tank it's not bad building
[3:29:03.560 --> 3:29:09.360]  construction it's not fires it's not no no they they gave a new reason a new
[3:29:09.360 --> 3:29:13.760]  syndrome a new phenomenon we're going to cover that right now with Mark
[3:29:13.760 --> 3:29:16.840]  Stipnowski stay with us
[3:29:20.360 --> 3:29:25.080]  okay we're gonna go ahead and skip that break mark a few stations won't won't
[3:29:25.080 --> 3:29:28.040]  hear us but I don't want to waste any time and this will have a life of its own
[3:29:28.040 --> 3:29:33.160]  on the web I mean that the the NIST report now says thermal expansion did it
[3:29:33.160 --> 3:29:37.560]  a new phenomenon never before seen seen in three buildings in a row they're now
[3:29:37.560 --> 3:29:41.280]  saying you may not even need a control demolition of a building just go light a
[3:29:41.280 --> 3:29:45.840]  few small fires I mean I mean they're having to re-engineer reality and
[3:29:45.840 --> 3:29:49.800]  insurance companies are having to change their whole view just to fit with
[3:29:49.800 --> 3:29:53.640]  something that never before happened just like they've had thousands of taser
[3:29:53.640 --> 3:29:58.040]  deaths worldwide they've now announced they believe it's a syndrome that the
[3:29:58.040 --> 3:30:02.920]  taser scares the person and makes them have a heart attack mark I mean I mean
[3:30:02.920 --> 3:30:07.520]  I mean now the BS like claiming Russia attacked Georgia three weeks ago when it's
[3:30:07.520 --> 3:30:12.880]  admitted that the U.S. back Georgians attacked first I mean we're entering like
[3:30:12.880 --> 3:30:17.080]  an Alice in Wonderland the propaganda is getting so crazy can you can you comment
[3:30:17.080 --> 3:30:22.000]  on that no question I mean we we are living in Orwell's world now where
[3:30:22.000 --> 3:30:27.360]  language has been entirely manipulated you know language has become at least
[3:30:27.360 --> 3:30:32.520]  politically and and in the media and news we've seen language become a tool of
[3:30:32.520 --> 3:30:38.240]  obfuscation you know it's been used to just confuse people it's been it's been
[3:30:38.240 --> 3:30:42.720]  used you know these slogans that the Republican Party comes up with it's
[3:30:42.720 --> 3:30:47.920]  just it's just a bastardization of the language you know it's obviously with
[3:30:47.920 --> 3:30:52.560]  this NIST report you can see them in full damage control mode you know it's
[3:30:52.560 --> 3:30:57.920]  obvious they've been stonewalling for years now that they're forced to release
[3:30:57.920 --> 3:31:02.280]  something they have to come up with the least hair brain thing they can think of
[3:31:02.280 --> 3:31:08.800]  and even that carries no weight whatsoever you know anybody who wants to
[3:31:08.800 --> 3:31:13.320]  obviously you can listen to Stephen Jones who's talked about firmate in the
[3:31:13.320 --> 3:31:17.720]  buildings they can listen to a guy Richard Gage who is an architect for
[3:31:17.720 --> 3:31:23.120]  9-11 Truth you know you can get an entire scientific rundown of why the
[3:31:23.120 --> 3:31:27.800]  government's explanation is is so far-fetched it's unbelievable I mean
[3:31:27.800 --> 3:31:32.600]  really what they're asking us to believe it's exactly what she said they expect
[3:31:32.600 --> 3:31:37.160]  us to discount every law physics that that we've ever learned or that's ever
[3:31:37.160 --> 3:31:43.120]  existed and somehow just accept with blind faith these new theories they come
[3:31:43.120 --> 3:31:47.640]  out with that they have absolutely no credibility whatsoever well I think it's
[3:31:47.640 --> 3:31:50.720]  brought them into a trap and I want you to speak to this I think it's brought
[3:31:50.720 --> 3:31:54.520]  them into a trap now because all these other mainline physicists architects
[3:31:54.520 --> 3:31:58.280]  engineers are going wait a minute and now they're looking at the NIST report
[3:31:58.280 --> 3:32:02.960]  and it's becoming like a Copernicus or a Galileo court debate and other
[3:32:02.960 --> 3:32:08.000]  scientists are now looking going wait a minute new phenomenon new you know
[3:32:08.000 --> 3:32:14.280]  1500 degree fires do you know do what only 2,800 would do and and wait you
[3:32:14.280 --> 3:32:20.960]  know the aerial photos from NASA do show 3,000 you know degrees 2,600 degrees
[3:32:20.960 --> 3:32:26.920]  they're like wait a minute so in a way they're claiming physics has changed is
[3:32:26.920 --> 3:32:31.760]  widening the debate and and backfiring on them I want you to comment on that
[3:32:31.760 --> 3:32:37.680]  we're coming back live to the full audience here we go Mark Stepnosky we're
[3:32:37.680 --> 3:32:42.800]  bringing up the NIST report and how they've had to change how physics works
[3:32:42.800 --> 3:32:46.280]  and so a lot of scientists and physicists and architects that weren't involved
[3:32:46.280 --> 3:32:50.920]  and didn't believe it was an inside job or now looking going you're saying jet
[3:32:50.920 --> 3:32:54.320]  fuel made 2,600 degree pockets of stuff five weeks later
[3:32:54.320 --> 3:32:59.360]  thousands of degrees hotter I mean this is I mean NIST coming out and saying
[3:32:59.360 --> 3:33:04.320]  now small fires bring down steel buildings is changing everything Mark
[3:33:04.320 --> 3:33:10.760]  continue yeah just I mean this this is coincides with the Bush
[3:33:10.760 --> 3:33:17.040]  administration's technique from day one they have actively sought to discredit
[3:33:17.040 --> 3:33:23.160]  science and to really argue with with scientific belief you know it doesn't
[3:33:23.160 --> 3:33:27.760]  matter whether it's the EPA the FDA whatever it is you know they they there's
[3:33:27.760 --> 3:33:33.680]  been active warfare on the part of the Bush administration against science and
[3:33:33.680 --> 3:33:38.600]  this is another clear-cut example of that well it's like marijuana they know
[3:33:38.600 --> 3:33:42.440]  marijuana didn't kill one person a year is a miracle drug with thousands of
[3:33:42.440 --> 3:33:47.440]  patented real things it does for cancer glaucoma but they're still SWAT team and
[3:33:47.440 --> 3:33:52.600]  people every day where I live looking for marijuana absolutely no matter how
[3:33:52.600 --> 3:33:59.160]  much evidence you present no matter how authoritative that evidence is no matter
[3:33:59.160 --> 3:34:03.800]  who it comes from as far as you know credible scientific or medical
[3:34:03.800 --> 3:34:08.080]  establishments it would just be written off by propaganda you know it really is
[3:34:08.080 --> 3:34:12.800]  an info war you can you can present any kind of factual evidence you want to
[3:34:12.800 --> 3:34:18.680]  support your theory but again you know corporate media the Republican or
[3:34:18.680 --> 3:34:22.600]  Democratic party they'll just write it off with propaganda but that is starting
[3:34:22.600 --> 3:34:27.280]  I'm sorry go ahead I'm sorry but that is what we are seeing right now it was
[3:34:27.280 --> 3:34:32.320]  just another by this NIST report trying to come out and explain why something
[3:34:32.320 --> 3:34:35.760]  that's never happened before it did happen namely three steel buildings
[3:34:35.760 --> 3:34:39.920]  collapsing because of fire in one day they do have to stretch the realms of
[3:34:39.920 --> 3:34:43.640]  reality you know they do have to contradict science and offer an
[3:34:43.640 --> 3:34:48.920]  alternative view which is completely bogus which is why I'm glad to see that
[3:34:48.920 --> 3:34:54.040]  people with people who are experts people you know whose backgrounds are in
[3:34:54.040 --> 3:34:59.360]  this field are coming forward and saying look you guys are just straining any
[3:34:59.360 --> 3:35:03.200]  credibility you have here to the breaking point we can't accept this the
[3:35:03.200 --> 3:35:06.960]  only thing is you know these these are things that this coming out in
[3:35:06.960 --> 3:35:11.160]  scientific journals and in academic papers they're peer reviewed these are
[3:35:11.160 --> 3:35:14.320]  not things that appear on the evening news or are going to be on a front page
[3:35:14.320 --> 3:35:19.240]  headline you know that's a great point first they said like three or four years
[3:35:19.240 --> 3:35:23.040]  ago oh let's see some studies and then they did studies let's see and be peer
[3:35:23.040 --> 3:35:26.840]  reviewed in the but a couple of them get peer reviewed by major major peer
[3:35:26.840 --> 3:35:32.320]  reviewed I mean not just side journals big marquee you know Super Bowl level
[3:35:32.320 --> 3:35:35.920]  journals we're talking the big ones you're the most prestigious and then
[3:35:35.920 --> 3:35:40.960]  they try to write that off I mean we keep clearing every hurdle mark and the
[3:35:40.960 --> 3:35:46.800]  other side is just looking stupider and stupider and I believe that NIST itself
[3:35:46.800 --> 3:35:52.200]  is part of the executive branch correct yes yes so there there we see another
[3:35:52.200 --> 3:35:56.320]  example you know just just like the office of national drug control policy
[3:35:56.320 --> 3:36:00.360]  as part of the executive branch and they are the ones who constantly spew
[3:36:00.360 --> 3:36:05.320]  forth misinformation about the drug war we have NIST which is also an executive
[3:36:05.320 --> 3:36:11.160]  branch administration you know leading the charge about the lies regarding 911
[3:36:11.160 --> 3:36:15.840]  well like you said though more and more people are tuning out of mainstream
[3:36:15.840 --> 3:36:19.800]  media it's exponential and instead of them reporting some of the truth are
[3:36:19.800 --> 3:36:23.080]  trying to act more credible it seems like they're getting more shrill more
[3:36:23.080 --> 3:36:29.280]  cartoonish more ridiculous piling lie on top of lie I don't know what the tactic
[3:36:29.280 --> 3:36:31.280]  is there but it doesn't seem to be working mark
[3:36:31.280 --> 3:36:35.640]  well reminds me old quote about and I can't remember who said it but it's just
[3:36:35.640 --> 3:36:40.800]  the the old quote about truth coming out you know first first went when you are
[3:36:40.800 --> 3:36:46.080]  truth teller you know in this age of universal deceit that we live in where
[3:36:46.080 --> 3:36:49.880]  those of us are trying to commit a revolutionary act by telling the truth
[3:36:49.880 --> 3:36:56.160]  you know it becomes evident that you know we will be attacked that's the
[3:36:56.160 --> 3:37:01.720]  first method actually the first method is to be written off and ridiculed and
[3:37:01.720 --> 3:37:05.760]  that was the case early on after September last we were all pigeonholed as
[3:37:05.760 --> 3:37:09.600]  conspiracy theorists and we were out of our minds so that was the ridicule then
[3:37:09.600 --> 3:37:14.280]  you had the vicious attacks you know now it's becoming obvious that you know
[3:37:14.280 --> 3:37:19.240]  the 911 truth movement is based on truth and facts and evidence we are
[3:37:19.240 --> 3:37:26.320]  being maliciously attacked yes and then you know I just want to follow up by again
[3:37:26.320 --> 3:37:29.880]  with that that that famous quotation the third stage of the truth being accepted
[3:37:29.880 --> 3:37:34.120]  as if people will accept it so I think now we are in the second stage you know
[3:37:34.120 --> 3:37:39.040]  those first few years we were attacked and vilified I'm sorry we were ridiculed
[3:37:39.040 --> 3:37:43.880]  now we are being attacked and vilified hopefully we are coming close to that
[3:37:43.880 --> 3:37:49.220]  third stage where there will be massed exemptance of this truth and people
[3:37:49.220 --> 3:37:54.080]  won't be afraid to put aside their cognitive dissonance and step out and
[3:37:54.080 --> 3:37:58.360]  accept this new paradigm of reality that we all have to see around us
[3:37:58.360 --> 3:38:01.720]  beautifully put and then that's really it I don't blame a lot of people who
[3:38:01.720 --> 3:38:05.280]  don't want to look at the facts because every night when I go to bed I look at
[3:38:05.280 --> 3:38:08.480]  how innocent my children are I look how good my wife is and I just think God
[3:38:08.480 --> 3:38:12.600]  there are really evil people in this world and they really are in control and
[3:38:12.600 --> 3:38:15.360]  I've really gotten their face and man I've been threatened and this is
[3:38:15.360 --> 3:38:19.320]  dangerous but then I realize you know I just can't let the world go on like this
[3:38:19.320 --> 3:38:23.200]  I've got to do my job whether it has an effect or not but the truth is when good
[3:38:23.200 --> 3:38:26.600]  people do get involved I believe as Thomas Jefferson said you know that we
[3:38:26.600 --> 3:38:31.480]  can't overturn evil it's evil only wins win good and men and women do nothing
[3:38:31.480 --> 3:38:35.800]  and and you're right first they ignore you then they attack you then you win
[3:38:35.800 --> 3:38:40.080]  and that's basically what's happening now or then there's another quote I'm
[3:38:40.080 --> 3:38:44.480]  butchering but a paraphrasing but you know truth goes through three stages
[3:38:44.480 --> 3:38:49.960]  first it's you know a laugh debt then it's ridicule then it's accepted as you
[3:38:49.960 --> 3:38:53.800]  know universally true and people who said the world was round were laughed at
[3:38:53.800 --> 3:38:58.600]  and now we know it's round mark well yeah and just you know for me personally
[3:38:58.600 --> 3:39:03.800]  you know again I think we should all just do what we can you know different
[3:39:03.800 --> 3:39:08.000]  people have different amounts of time different resources be they financial or
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:13.300]  whatever but I just felt personally as an American citizen it was my duty to
[3:39:13.300 --> 3:39:20.640]  speak out you know I was asked to do a newspaper article for my hometown and
[3:39:20.640 --> 3:39:25.480]  it was just one of those deals where are they now what are they doing now that
[3:39:25.480 --> 3:39:30.400]  they're retired and I just again I felt compelled to at least let people in
[3:39:30.400 --> 3:39:35.960]  Erie Pennsylvania my hometown who read the paper know that somebody who came
[3:39:35.960 --> 3:39:40.720]  from there doesn't believe in the official story of 9-11 and you know
[3:39:40.720 --> 3:39:44.760]  wholeheartedly believes that they too should seek out the truth for themselves
[3:39:44.760 --> 3:39:48.280]  what type of response I mean I know overwhelmingly it was positive but what
[3:39:48.280 --> 3:39:52.120]  type of negative responses did you get and then what was it like with your
[3:39:52.120 --> 3:39:58.480]  moral courage to go through that and not recant well you know that the reaction
[3:39:58.480 --> 3:40:01.800]  overwhelmingly was positive I mean I don't I don't spend a lot of time at
[3:40:01.800 --> 3:40:05.600]  hometown anymore and you know I know that there were people who wrote in letters
[3:40:05.600 --> 3:40:10.240]  saying you know what's wrong with this guy he's way out in that field but like
[3:40:10.240 --> 3:40:14.920]  like we discussed earlier and now that we are you know coming up on eight years
[3:40:14.920 --> 3:40:19.520]  after the fact people are coming I'm sorry seven years after the fact people
[3:40:19.520 --> 3:40:24.240]  are becoming aware of what actually happened that day you know the initial
[3:40:24.240 --> 3:40:27.520]  shock value of that psychological operation is wearing off people are
[3:40:27.520 --> 3:40:31.680]  getting a chance to see what really went on behind the scenes so I didn't really
[3:40:31.680 --> 3:40:39.520]  suffer much fallout at all you know it's just again regardless of how many
[3:40:39.520 --> 3:40:42.520]  people might write in and there's always going to be a few you know who would
[3:40:42.520 --> 3:40:45.640]  just personally attack you I experienced the same thing when I spoke out against
[3:40:45.640 --> 3:40:50.080]  marijuana laws you know you have people saying that you're not a good role model
[3:40:50.080 --> 3:40:55.080]  you know that you're a proponent of drug use and everything else yeah but you go
[3:40:55.080 --> 3:40:59.840]  to a football game and there's liquor ads everywhere which which no doubt is
[3:40:59.840 --> 3:41:04.120]  bad for you but then you know these guys with a whiskey bottle how dare you be
[3:41:04.120 --> 3:41:09.320]  for that Merle water I mean yeah yeah it's just you know again it's people have
[3:41:09.320 --> 3:41:13.120]  blinders on with certain respect to the war on drugs just like they do with 9
[3:41:13.120 --> 3:41:17.840]  11 so I just wanted to you know like again you know for for people in my
[3:41:17.840 --> 3:41:22.720]  hometown who might know who I am or what I stand for you know at least they might
[3:41:22.720 --> 3:41:26.040]  know enough about me to know that I'm not just some guy spouting off that I
[3:41:26.040 --> 3:41:30.280]  might be a guy who actually does have educated opinions and it might be worth
[3:41:30.280 --> 3:41:33.520]  their while to follow up on what I said because they might learn something
[3:41:33.520 --> 3:41:37.440]  absolutely let's take some calls for Mark Stepnowski mark before we do that in
[3:41:37.440 --> 3:41:41.560]  the last 15 or 16 minutes any other points you wanted to add anything else
[3:41:41.560 --> 3:41:45.360]  you wanted to point out I would just like to tell people that they should
[3:41:45.360 --> 3:41:49.720]  make a personal commitment in their life to continue to educate themselves on
[3:41:49.720 --> 3:41:53.200]  these issues you know the easiest thing in the world is just a pigeonhole
[3:41:53.200 --> 3:41:57.360]  something and write it off put a label on it and say I don't have to look at
[3:41:57.360 --> 3:42:01.400]  20 any further you know you know they'll just categorize it as something they
[3:42:01.400 --> 3:42:05.240]  don't want to know and then just move on that's the easiest thing to do and I
[3:42:05.240 --> 3:42:09.120]  say intellectually that's the lazy thing to do I think people should take it
[3:42:09.120 --> 3:42:12.800]  upon themselves how the initiative if you're gonna disprove something if you're
[3:42:12.800 --> 3:42:17.600]  gonna write it off at least look into it and have an educated opinion about it
[3:42:17.600 --> 3:42:22.800]  so I just I you know I know there's a lot of nonsense out there regarding any
[3:42:22.800 --> 3:42:27.840]  topic including 9-11 got you what did you go ahead I would just you know tell
[3:42:27.840 --> 3:42:32.560]  people to to look into to anything they can like some of the things I mentioned
[3:42:32.560 --> 3:42:37.840]  earlier scholars from 9-11 truth any 9-11 truth chapter you know cities all
[3:42:37.840 --> 3:42:41.880]  over North America have their own separate 9-11 truth factor we have a
[3:42:41.880 --> 3:42:46.880]  great one here in Toronto British or Vancouver British Columbia as well as
[3:42:46.880 --> 3:42:51.560]  Toronto and Ottawa across Canada just like in the States I need to send you
[3:42:51.560 --> 3:42:57.680]  truth-rising we've got Canadian US 9-11 truth we are changes exploding that
[3:42:57.680 --> 3:43:01.160]  new film just came out I I know you've seen terror storm what did you think of
[3:43:01.160 --> 3:43:06.000]  that film I thought it was outstanding there are a lot of great movies out
[3:43:06.000 --> 3:43:10.520]  right now there's a current one people can watch on YouTube called shadow play
[3:43:10.520 --> 3:43:16.560]  which is an excellent excellent synopsis of you know the 9-11 false flag terror
[3:43:16.560 --> 3:43:21.120]  attack it's a film that's coming out in segments and they can they can watch
[3:43:21.120 --> 3:43:26.040]  those on YouTube that's an excellent education for anybody who wants to kind
[3:43:26.040 --> 3:43:29.880]  of get a crash course on this subject well and remember folks the evil people
[3:43:29.880 --> 3:43:34.120]  that did this are still there and I wish they were in a cave that's a lot less
[3:43:34.120 --> 3:43:39.320]  scary than knowing they're in control of our government and no question about it
[3:43:39.320 --> 3:43:44.960]  I mean we see now in a Dutch newspaper talk of Iraq or attack on Iran is
[3:43:44.960 --> 3:43:50.240]  imminent you know for I'm so glad to see that you're at the Democratic National
[3:43:50.240 --> 3:43:53.400]  Convention because people seem to think that if we get a Democrat in office
[3:43:53.400 --> 3:43:57.520]  there's going to be big changes but the Democratic Congress has already signed
[3:43:57.520 --> 3:44:02.680]  off on a preemptive nuclear attack against Iran absolutely I don't know
[3:44:02.680 --> 3:44:08.280]  anybody can expect anything to the contrary should Democrats be in power
[3:44:08.280 --> 3:44:11.840]  yeah and again we're not bashing either party folks the point is is that the
[3:44:11.840 --> 3:44:15.320]  corporates have taken over everything and until we recognize that both parties
[3:44:15.320 --> 3:44:19.080]  have been taken over we can never set about fixing the real problem if we're
[3:44:19.080 --> 3:44:24.160]  in that control paradigm we again five-time pro bowler two-time Superbowl
[3:44:24.160 --> 3:44:29.160]  champion Mark Stipnowski is our guest former Dallas Cowboy Houston Euler let's
[3:44:29.160 --> 3:44:36.200]  go ahead and talk to Tim in New York then we'll go to Adam Tim KC Victor and
[3:44:36.200 --> 3:44:40.800]  others so go ahead you're on the air Tim in New York hi Alex and Mark give you a
[3:44:40.800 --> 3:44:44.480]  lot of credit for what you're doing I'm involved in a situation here now where
[3:44:44.480 --> 3:44:49.880]  I'm experiencing my friend and girlfriend of 12 years as being soft killed as we
[3:44:49.880 --> 3:44:54.640]  speak she has a brother that's in the State Department she gave him a copy of
[3:44:54.640 --> 3:44:59.680]  the road to tyranny in about 2002 and ever since then they've got her family's
[3:44:59.680 --> 3:45:04.320]  really been against us she was an experimental guinea pig back in 1958 we
[3:45:04.320 --> 3:45:08.720]  had her thymus radiated she's always had lifelong allergies and actually a
[3:45:08.720 --> 3:45:12.040]  victim of sexual abuse when she was a child is her mother brought foster
[3:45:12.040 --> 3:45:16.280]  kids into the house on July of this year she finally found out that she had a
[3:45:16.280 --> 3:45:20.040]  lot of thyroid problems and a lot of hormone deficiencies causing some
[3:45:20.040 --> 3:45:24.640]  memory problems about a month later her brother came home from where he works
[3:45:24.640 --> 3:45:28.640]  this in the State Department coerced her into going to lunch with her he
[3:45:28.640 --> 3:45:31.560]  never she never came home what he did is told her who's going to get her to a
[3:45:31.560 --> 3:45:36.040]  doctor the next day put her into the psychiatric ward up at Strong Memorial
[3:45:36.040 --> 3:45:40.560]  and since then sir you need to put the names the emails the facts I need to
[3:45:40.560 --> 3:45:44.160]  confirm this happened I believe you but I need to confirm it that's big news so
[3:45:44.160 --> 3:45:48.480]  let me stop you so because she was a 9-11 truth or she's been stuck in a
[3:45:48.480 --> 3:45:52.280]  mental ward and we're starting to see this happen like the old Soviet Union
[3:45:52.280 --> 3:45:56.080]  I'm gonna get your name and number off air and I and then we'll have you on as
[3:45:56.080 --> 3:46:01.200]  a guest if I can see some documents and confirm this but we have seen calls it's
[3:46:01.200 --> 3:46:05.440]  in the new film truth rising all the major cable channels saying kill Alex
[3:46:05.440 --> 3:46:10.960]  Jones put them in FEMA camps their terrorist taser 9-11 truthers send them
[3:46:10.960 --> 3:46:15.040]  to get Moe and they're serious Mark Stepnowski they I mean they're getting
[3:46:15.040 --> 3:46:20.880]  scared of us now yeah no question you'll see it across the board yeah you know
[3:46:20.880 --> 3:46:26.600]  whether it's herald over there or Bill Maher or any of these guys who you know
[3:46:26.600 --> 3:46:30.200]  are in a position where they have a show on corporate media and the only way
[3:46:30.200 --> 3:46:36.560]  they're gonna continue to maintain their show is to spout the the lies of the
[3:46:36.560 --> 3:46:39.920]  current administration you know the corporate party line of them and call
[3:46:39.920 --> 3:46:44.600]  them for violence against us is what blows me away yeah well again you know
[3:46:44.600 --> 3:46:50.600]  it's when I think Sinclair Lewis said when fascism comes to America it'll be
[3:46:50.600 --> 3:46:54.680]  wrapped in the flag and carrying across yeah that's what Paul said and gotten
[3:46:54.680 --> 3:46:58.240]  trouble he's not saying Christians are bad he's saying evil people will use
[3:46:58.240 --> 3:47:02.960]  that yeah I mean if that's not what we're seeing right now I don't know
[3:47:02.960 --> 3:47:07.720]  what we're seeing because you know we are looking at again the the corporate
[3:47:07.720 --> 3:47:13.160]  ownership of both political parties again you're wrapped in the flag carrying
[3:47:13.160 --> 3:47:19.160]  across that's it Adam Lee in the defense of religion and freedom they
[3:47:19.160 --> 3:47:24.280]  are trying to ramrod a whole system of laws that through that is to the
[3:47:24.280 --> 3:47:28.040]  detriment of everybody you got it and has nothing to do with Christianity Adam
[3:47:28.040 --> 3:47:32.760]  in Texas you're on the air with Mark Stepnowski go ahead hey Mark great talk
[3:47:32.760 --> 3:47:37.440]  to you I watched you through your career and some of the finest football I've
[3:47:37.440 --> 3:47:43.720]  ever seen and I was wondering if you caught Alex up there behind the MSNBC
[3:47:43.720 --> 3:47:48.160]  counter and I wonder if you've met anybody more tenacious and more
[3:47:48.160 --> 3:47:55.880]  wonderful than Alex Jones oh come on sounds like a setup call I was I did see
[3:47:55.880 --> 3:48:01.400]  the clip online where a tea boom pickers was being interviewed on MSNBC
[3:48:01.400 --> 3:48:06.240]  background that was Minneapolis 9-11 truth we took over for three hours at
[3:48:06.240 --> 3:48:12.200]  the DNC I think that's outstanding I think again like we saw with her all
[3:48:12.200 --> 3:48:16.080]  they were there and like we saw with Bill Maher there's gonna have to
[3:48:16.080 --> 3:48:20.720]  continue and we are change people who do it everywhere there has to continue to
[3:48:20.720 --> 3:48:27.400]  be a breakthrough into mainstream media of 9-11 truth again it it's become
[3:48:27.400 --> 3:48:31.560]  obvious that we're not gonna have a top-down solution to this problem you
[3:48:31.560 --> 3:48:36.080]  know the censorship is coming from top-down it's coming bottom up exactly
[3:48:36.080 --> 3:48:39.880]  it's gonna have to be grassroots and that's the beauty of the 9-11 truth
[3:48:39.880 --> 3:48:44.600]  movement you know people it's a grassroots movement people don't have to
[3:48:44.600 --> 3:48:49.160]  rely on anything else other than their fellow citizens who want to get to the
[3:48:49.160 --> 3:48:52.600]  bottom of this well I have to find out the truth well exactly I have to use the
[3:48:52.600 --> 3:48:55.680]  football analogy what's it called what's the the terms looked at my tongue
[3:48:55.680 --> 3:49:00.920]  where where the the the ball is moved by running you know just a foot at a time
[3:49:00.920 --> 3:49:09.680]  a long battle down the whole field yes yeah time of possession yeah like yeah
[3:49:09.680 --> 3:49:13.760]  because you're gonna ground up you're gonna grind eat eat up the clock yeah
[3:49:13.760 --> 3:49:17.720]  ground war whatever possession yeah exactly I mean I mean that's what this
[3:49:17.720 --> 3:49:21.960]  is and we've gone like 80 yards we've got 20 more to go we got a first down
[3:49:21.960 --> 3:49:26.240]  we've had all these victories I mean folks we're winning we can win this
[3:49:26.240 --> 3:49:31.560]  thing yeah I think really people should again just concentrate on what they
[3:49:31.560 --> 3:49:37.600]  themselves can do don't feel powerless don't think like you know you have to
[3:49:37.600 --> 3:49:42.000]  accept these things even though you don't believe them there is every person
[3:49:42.000 --> 3:49:47.800]  has has it in themselves to make a decision to do what is right absolutely
[3:49:47.800 --> 3:49:51.000]  let's take another call I'm going to skip this break to just skip the music as
[3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:54.840]  well for the info wars calm listeners and stations that choose to carry and I'm
[3:49:54.840 --> 3:50:01.040]  skipping the break let's go ahead and talk to who's up next Tim in North
[3:50:01.040 --> 3:50:07.120]  Carolina you're on the air with Mark Stepnowski hey guys you came up with a
[3:50:07.120 --> 3:50:13.040]  football analogy there Alex that's exactly what I was thinking about Mark you played defense played
[3:50:13.040 --> 3:50:20.040]  offense I played center yeah hello he played center he was offensive lineman
[3:50:20.040 --> 3:50:25.200]  offensively well what I was thinking was if you're playing defense and what
[3:50:25.200 --> 3:50:28.960]  that's what the 9-11 things all about we're defending ourselves against those
[3:50:28.960 --> 3:50:33.320]  guys you're trying to fool your opponent but what I've been doing is I've been
[3:50:33.320 --> 3:50:40.160]  taking your films and Burmese films and all of them and re-labeling them and you
[3:50:40.160 --> 3:50:45.520]  rail on the defense and all those guys tactics all the time about how bad they
[3:50:45.520 --> 3:50:50.240]  are but I've been using them against them and I'll take your CDs or your DVDs
[3:50:50.240 --> 3:50:54.600]  and I'll I'll re-label them how the Democrats cause 9-11 and give them to
[3:50:54.600 --> 3:50:59.720]  Republicans and then I'll re-label them how the Republicans cause the 9-11 I
[3:50:59.720 --> 3:51:04.320]  give them to Democrats and that makes them fight on it and just like defense or
[3:51:04.320 --> 3:51:09.480]  office trying to make make well well you're using the false left paradigm
[3:51:09.480 --> 3:51:13.240]  against them I'm not gonna say you're bad but in my experience it's best to not
[3:51:13.240 --> 3:51:18.600]  be deceptive I would just say this is a shocking film very controversial ooh you
[3:51:18.600 --> 3:51:23.480]  know these are hard to get which is true tell me what you think about it it's just
[3:51:23.480 --> 3:51:28.840]  so hard to get them to bite though if you when you do that it's just so hard
[3:51:28.840 --> 3:51:37.720]  well then tell them it's Jessica Simpson neck it that'll you just have to get
[3:51:37.720 --> 3:51:41.400]  them to ask one question just like you only have to get one safety out of line
[3:51:41.400 --> 3:51:46.720]  to score touchdown yeah you know you know just that little little inroads right
[3:51:46.720 --> 3:51:50.000]  well something I haven't done yet because it is deceptive but I'm really
[3:51:50.000 --> 3:51:53.600]  thinking about doing it because you'll see something with 33 million views on
[3:51:53.600 --> 3:51:58.800]  YouTube and it'll be a vitamin ad for 10 seconds with 20 seconds of of a
[3:51:58.800 --> 3:52:03.080]  shot of some you know not even their breasts showing and I'm thinking wait to
[3:52:03.080 --> 3:52:07.960]  get the truth out I might as well do that but I mean because anything to get
[3:52:07.960 --> 3:52:10.760]  the truth out but it's a dangerous slippery slope that's kind of the
[3:52:10.760 --> 3:52:14.960]  mindset the military used to end up carrying out 9-11 well we lose troops
[3:52:14.960 --> 3:52:19.360]  as a pawn in war why not go ahead and sacrifice 3,000 Americans so we can
[3:52:19.360 --> 3:52:22.800]  defeat the evil Muslims which another brand of government you know ended up
[3:52:22.800 --> 3:52:28.160]  funding mark your comments on that that that's a great point you know the some
[3:52:28.160 --> 3:52:33.280]  of the guys who are actually responsible for 9-11 like Richard Meyers and Ralph
[3:52:33.280 --> 3:52:39.360]  Eberhardt and Montague Whitfield these generals you know at the Pentagon you
[3:52:39.360 --> 3:52:42.680]  know these are the guys who escape public scrutiny you know these are the
[3:52:42.680 --> 3:52:46.520]  guys behind the scenes who are running the war games you know along with that
[3:52:46.520 --> 3:52:51.080]  Dick Cheney and Dullrumsfeld you know the guys that have everything going on
[3:52:51.080 --> 3:52:55.880]  that day to make that drill become live and to have it go through and have a
[3:52:55.880 --> 3:53:01.960]  desired effect that's what we are dealing with right now again you know I
[3:53:01.960 --> 3:53:06.160]  just urge everybody you know people get caught up in the Republican Democratic
[3:53:06.160 --> 3:53:10.480]  dialectic you know they they they don't remember that you know we have a one
[3:53:10.480 --> 3:53:15.680]  party system masquerading as two parties so I think people need to continue to
[3:53:15.680 --> 3:53:21.240]  look past that don't get caught up in the partisan politics realize that what's
[3:53:21.240 --> 3:53:25.160]  going on affects all of us regardless of how we're going to vote in any given
[3:53:25.160 --> 3:53:29.400]  election absolutely that's a look just look beyond and see the big picture
[3:53:29.400 --> 3:53:33.920]  absolutely we're going to come back now and take a few final calls mark we got
[3:53:33.920 --> 3:53:37.480]  to do this more often than just once every eight nine ten months it's just
[3:53:37.480 --> 3:53:40.960]  been great having you here and I hope to sometime bump into you in person because
[3:53:40.960 --> 3:53:45.600]  I just really admire people with your type of courage here we go
[3:53:45.600 --> 3:53:55.960]  it's an inside job folks final segment mark Stepnowski marker do you have a
[3:53:55.960 --> 3:53:59.760]  personal website or is there a site you want to plug or something you want to
[3:53:59.760 --> 3:54:06.880]  say here at the end well again I would just you know for for those of those of
[3:54:06.880 --> 3:54:12.360]  us in in Canada I would just like again to bring up the the march that the 9-11
[3:54:12.360 --> 3:54:17.480]  true Society of Vancouver has orchestrated it's already began it's
[3:54:17.480 --> 3:54:21.960]  going to culminate in Ottawa on September 15th I believe today there in
[3:54:21.960 --> 3:54:27.560]  Sudbury and Toronto Ontario these these 9-11 truthers have been traveling
[3:54:27.560 --> 3:54:31.800]  across the country to get petitions they're going to march from Montreal to
[3:54:31.800 --> 3:54:38.560]  Ottawa and arrive on September 11th with with all the signatures that they get
[3:54:38.560 --> 3:54:43.600]  nationwide on this petition and this is for a new 9-11 investigation in Canada
[3:54:43.600 --> 3:54:49.880]  because what people forget is 9-11 was it was obviously portrayed as an attack
[3:54:49.880 --> 3:54:54.880]  against America but it was a worldwide crime there were citizens I believe
[3:54:54.880 --> 3:54:58.680]  from over 80 countries and it totally trade center and it totally freaks out
[3:54:58.680 --> 3:55:02.320]  the global controllers when we're out marching when we don't shut up when we
[3:55:02.320 --> 3:55:06.600]  don't stop they tell us we don't have power we know that's a lie an enemy will
[3:55:06.600 --> 3:55:10.240]  always tell you you don't have a chance to win folks at psychological warfare we
[3:55:10.240 --> 3:55:13.400]  aren't we don't just have a chance we are going to win we are never going to
[3:55:13.400 --> 3:55:17.760]  stop a couple final calls Victor in Canada speaking of Canada you're on the
[3:55:17.760 --> 3:55:21.960]  air with Mark Stepnowski go ahead hi there thanks Mark for everything you're
[3:55:21.960 --> 3:55:25.560]  doing including plugging the march on Ottawa I'm actually from Ottawa I have
[3:55:25.560 --> 3:55:29.200]  a comment and a question first my question is what advice do you have
[3:55:29.200 --> 3:55:35.960]  for a closet celebrity truthers I would tell them just to instead of having a
[3:55:35.960 --> 3:55:40.440]  fear the unknown just come forward and speak the truth speak from your heart
[3:55:40.440 --> 3:55:46.520]  you know be honest with people have facts to back up your point of view and I
[3:55:46.520 --> 3:55:49.880]  really think that being the case there's nothing for people to fear hey
[3:55:49.880 --> 3:55:54.000]  think about Charlie Sheen and especially with his baggage he was the first
[3:55:54.000 --> 3:55:58.920]  think about what he did people appreciate someone who's willing to come
[3:55:58.920 --> 3:56:02.840]  forward I think as time goes on people are realizing how sanitized and
[3:56:02.840 --> 3:56:08.240]  censored mainstream media is and whether somebody is a 9-11 truth or who
[3:56:08.240 --> 3:56:12.400]  tells the truth or a politician who's willing to give up the talking points
[3:56:12.400 --> 3:56:16.800]  and just you know speak truthfully people appreciate that because it's so rare
[3:56:16.800 --> 3:56:21.800]  absolutely absolutely that's what matters in this world is conviction and
[3:56:21.800 --> 3:56:25.480]  honor and duty and goodness and Mark Stepnowski and many others have got it
[3:56:25.480 --> 3:56:29.040]  and we just love to be part of this brotherhood this sisterhood of man of
[3:56:29.040 --> 3:56:32.720]  people that stand up and have courage real fast Norman in North Carolina you

[3:56:55.440 --> 3:57:00.080]  and a real feeling of patriotism and I'm too it that we have critical mass and
[3:57:00.080 --> 3:57:04.640]  given that the news report is laughable it's just a matter of time before we
[3:57:04.640 --> 3:57:08.360]  have resolution well God bless you guys and thank you so much absolutely let me
[3:57:08.360 --> 3:57:12.280]  be clear here at the end we reach critical mass years ago in every major
[3:57:12.280 --> 3:57:16.520]  poll the majority believe that there's a cover-up a huge portion of that majority
[3:57:16.520 --> 3:57:20.040]  believe inside job and those are in polls when they're calling somebody up and
[3:57:20.040 --> 3:57:23.720]  folks usually don't answer controversially we reach critical mass
[3:57:23.720 --> 3:57:26.800]  people just don't realize that the majority of us know the truth and we're
[3:57:26.800 --> 3:57:30.720]  scared people like Mark Stepnowski stepping up to the plate that lets
[3:57:30.720 --> 3:57:33.880]  people see the courage and let some know that we're not alone in fact that
[3:57:33.880 --> 3:57:37.360]  we're the majority and so now we've just got to take back control of our
[3:57:37.360 --> 3:57:41.440]  government we are the majority Mark Stepnowski thank you so much for spending
