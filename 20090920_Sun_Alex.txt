[00:57.720 --> 01:03.440]  be covering right after this quick break coming up in a moment first off we're
[01:03.440 --> 01:08.360]  not even looking for eugenics news and it's everywhere it doesn't matter if I
[01:08.360 --> 01:11.800]  go to CNN or doesn't matter if I go to Drudge Report it doesn't matter if I'm
[01:11.800 --> 01:16.560]  reading the local paper here in Austin doesn't matter if I travel somewhere in
[01:16.560 --> 01:24.320]  the country literally 30 40 50 mainstream news articles a day saying
[01:24.320 --> 01:29.200]  there needs to be a tax on having more than one child that is the one child
[01:29.200 --> 01:36.040]  policy that's how it began in China this is the eugenics system for eugenics and
[01:36.040 --> 01:41.200]  it's openly being announced with that though look at this newsweek the case
[01:41.200 --> 01:47.000]  for killing granny and then it goes on to say it's good to kill her curbing
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.840]  excessive end-of-life care is good for America
[01:49.840 --> 01:58.760]  Evan Thomas I was a teenage death panelist there are death panels that's
[01:58.760 --> 02:06.320]  what the bioethics boards do under the socialized health care model so they
[02:06.320 --> 02:13.160]  deny out of one side of their mouth what they're doing and out of the other side
[02:13.160 --> 02:16.680]  they push it and that's a psychological warfare tactic so we're going to go over
[02:16.680 --> 02:26.160]  that first in detail after this break then in other news Russia two weeks ago
[02:26.160 --> 02:33.200]  it came out in the Jerusalem Post that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Yagin
[02:33.200 --> 02:40.760]  Yahub had traveled secretly to Russia to make a deal on hitting Iran a lot of
[02:40.760 --> 02:43.600]  people denied that that was what was really happening but the Jerusalem Post
[02:43.600 --> 02:51.320]  said that was the case now Putin the real president of Russia and his surrogate
[02:51.320 --> 02:58.480]  Medvedev are both making noises that that is the case and saying we now are
[02:58.480 --> 03:04.600]  going to help you put sanctions on Iran and you see Obama saying for now they're

[06:35.120 --> 06:39.840]  that since I got on air close to 14 years ago coming up on 14 years in one
[06:39.840 --> 06:47.200]  month I was aware day one reading United Nations government documents reading
[06:47.200 --> 06:51.960]  the different statements put out by climate change panels reading what the
[06:51.960 --> 06:58.120]  club of Rome said that the overarching reason for world government and a
[06:58.120 --> 07:03.760]  planetary regime by the world planners was so they could carry out forced
[07:03.760 --> 07:09.800]  eugenics one-child policies for sterilization euthanizing the old and
[07:09.800 --> 07:15.880]  then finally going to a zero growth not even allowing one child now this is in
[07:15.880 --> 07:21.880]  the United Nations biological diversity assessment 1996 it is in club of Rome
[07:21.880 --> 07:25.680]  documents I made the film in game blueprint for global enslavement that
[07:25.680 --> 07:33.720]  details it but earlier in 2009 an 1100 page government policy book written by
[07:33.720 --> 07:39.480]  the White House science are and since then I counted them up last week we
[07:39.480 --> 07:45.080]  have bought 10 other books written by him or co-authored by him that save and
[07:45.080 --> 07:50.400]  worse things for the film I'm making fall the Republic that's now done and
[07:50.400 --> 07:55.840]  comes out October 21st it's now being sent off later this week we're doing a
[07:55.840 --> 07:59.440]  few final touches with music and things making a few final cuts in the next two
[07:59.440 --> 08:03.880]  days but it's being sent to be mass produced this week and then goes on
[08:03.880 --> 08:10.600]  pre-sale later this week and will be shipping out to everybody on her before
[08:10.600 --> 08:16.840]  October 21st on DVD but but side issue while researching fall of the Republic
[08:16.840 --> 08:23.120]  we purchased all the books written by this man and then we purchased his
[08:23.120 --> 08:26.440]  co-authors books books he co-authored with people the books he didn't write by
[08:26.440 --> 08:31.160]  other people and it's all how they're going to kill you and how they're going
[08:31.160 --> 08:34.040]  to get socialized health care and to carry it out how they're going to bank
[08:34.040 --> 08:38.680]  rock the economy by design to force you under government control so they can do
[08:38.680 --> 08:44.160]  it and we're not reading the 10 books we bought of his we did read most of this
[08:44.160 --> 08:51.200]  1100 pager we just go to the footnotes and then read the subsections and Aaron
[08:51.200 --> 08:55.680]  has bought another probably 40 50 out there's giant stacks everywhere of
[08:55.680 --> 09:00.160]  eugenics books currently in a written the last year last five years last ten
[09:00.160 --> 09:05.040]  years it is a nightmare it's very hard to sleep at night once you know this and
[09:05.040 --> 09:08.240]  then you start going oh that's a government official in the Republicans
[09:08.240 --> 09:11.640]  that's a government official in the Democrats that's a government official
[09:11.640 --> 09:17.520]  in the Labor Party that's a government official in the Tories in England oh
[09:17.520 --> 09:22.960]  that's the German president or the German Chancellor and you go look them up
[09:22.960 --> 09:28.480]  and they're eugenicists you don't get into power in the West unless you're a
[09:28.480 --> 09:34.680]  eugenicist the bushes are all into it Obama's into it Obama's science are is
[09:34.680 --> 09:41.640]  the rock star of this and we've got video clips of him during his confirmation
[09:41.640 --> 09:46.680]  before Senator Jay Rockefeller and Jay Rockefeller literally is worshiping him
[09:46.680 --> 09:52.200]  saying you walk on water you are a god we all admire you you are the greatest
[09:52.200 --> 09:58.720]  man living because to them we've identified John P. Holdren as the rock
[09:58.720 --> 10:05.280]  star I mean this this is the man that decides how much fluoride is put in your
[10:05.280 --> 10:08.920]  water this is the guy that sides when to roll out a vaccine program to sterilize
[10:08.920 --> 10:13.880]  you this is the guy of how to roll out a plan to sell people only having one
[10:13.880 --> 10:18.720]  child and the average yuppie fool when you talk to him goes well there are too
[10:18.720 --> 10:23.520]  many people and I go well do you want your water poison to sterilize you or to
[10:23.520 --> 10:31.680]  lower your fertility and they say no or some of them say yes I guarantee you if
[10:31.680 --> 10:34.920]  they really thought about that they wouldn't before but that's how sick they
[10:34.920 --> 10:39.840]  are and that's how the conditioning has seeped its way into our lives that the
[10:39.840 --> 10:46.560]  average person out there has this kind of received common knowledge common sense
[10:46.560 --> 10:51.480]  like you don't play in traffic that's real common sense don't go out 935 or a
[10:51.480 --> 10:55.760]  busy interstate highway and run around in front of cars they have this well
[10:55.760 --> 10:59.560]  we've got to get rid of the people and then you tell them and you go but you
[10:59.560 --> 11:06.640]  aren't a member of the elite and they say oh but Rob Jacobson who does main
[11:06.640 --> 11:10.240]  editing here for us on the films he goes to Whole Foods a few times a week he
[11:10.240 --> 11:15.040]  likes it I like it too it's nice a little overpriced but he goes in there and
[11:15.040 --> 11:21.280]  he saw this on the store shelf the case for killing granny Newsweek and while
[11:21.280 --> 11:25.480]  he's waiting in line he flips it open and it says curbing excessive end-of-life
[11:25.480 --> 11:29.680]  care is good for America and it's a eugenics argument about killing grandma
[11:29.680 --> 11:35.160]  and he gets up there and he knows the girl at the counter gets his little
[11:35.160 --> 11:40.680]  little flirtation going on there according to Rob Rob's quite the ladies
[11:40.680 --> 11:45.440]  man around here but the point is is that he said she said oh the case for
[11:45.440 --> 11:48.560]  killing granny he said what you think that's interesting and she said yeah I
[11:48.560 --> 11:53.120]  think it's a good idea and he said don't you understand this is eugenics they
[11:53.120 --> 11:57.320]  want to do this to you too and and and she goes yeah there's too many people
[11:57.320 --> 12:03.280]  and he said but do you want do you want to die and she said well I guess so yes
[12:03.280 --> 12:07.560]  I guess I need to be killed and he said are you joking and she said no so here
[12:07.560 --> 12:12.600]  was one saying humans are so bad that's like dr. Pionka one of the heads of the
[12:12.600 --> 12:18.000]  biology department at UT he his graduate students have written me letters
[12:18.000 --> 12:23.440]  threatening me and bragging that dr. Pionka only wants to kill 90% of us I
[12:23.440 --> 12:28.240]  want to kill everyone here's my graduate paper and you go read their graduate
[12:28.240 --> 12:31.040]  paper then you find out they're working in bio weapons now for the US
[12:31.040 --> 12:35.280]  government I mean I got people writing me threatening letters that are that
[12:35.280 --> 12:40.960]  are doctors of biology working in bio weapons and you start looking at who
[12:40.960 --> 12:44.640]  heads up the bio weapons programs they call it bio defense because it's double
[12:44.640 --> 12:48.240]  edged and they're all eugenicists just like the head of the human genome
[12:48.240 --> 12:52.160]  project mr. Watson who was in my film in game two and a half years ago a year
[12:52.160 --> 12:55.600]  after it came out I said he was eugenicist because of his writings came
[12:55.600 --> 13:03.160]  out and said blacks aren't even human basically now guess who writes about him
[13:03.160 --> 13:11.120]  and others admiring him John P. Holdren White House scientists are what did
[13:11.120 --> 13:15.640]  Obama do he kicked in more funding for China's forced abortions on record and
[13:15.640 --> 13:20.280]  for abortions in Africa where they say you get food stamp money in Africa say
[13:20.280 --> 13:24.880]  in Nigeria but you got to be sterilized or you got to have an abortion now
[13:24.880 --> 13:31.080]  here's the deal news week the last two issues had one about your baby is a
[13:31.080 --> 13:35.280]  racist and it said all whites are racist because the western world is
[13:35.280 --> 13:39.640]  predominantly white and because we use more resources we're all bad and racist
[13:39.640 --> 13:44.200]  we've got to stop having kids using guilt saying stop having kids but the real
[13:44.200 --> 13:49.960]  eugenics is pointed at the third world keeping them from developing but see they
[13:49.960 --> 13:54.200]  sell it to white yuppies as oh we got to give the blacks and in Latin Americans
[13:54.200 --> 13:58.480]  and Asians more so I want to go over this today but that was the issue two
[13:58.480 --> 14:03.160]  weeks ago this is the September 21st it always comes out a few days early news
[14:03.160 --> 14:07.680]  week the case for killing granny if you're watching a simulcast right now
[14:07.680 --> 14:11.880]  at prison planet dot TV if you're listening to the radio you can just go
[14:11.880 --> 14:16.720]  to any bookstore or go to newsweek.com look at the latest issue the case for
[14:16.720 --> 14:23.160]  killing granny and it's got a computer plug unplugged on the cover and it says
[14:23.160 --> 14:27.760]  now now I covered news week a month ago had a thing about how beautiful it was
[14:27.760 --> 14:32.120]  that people were committing suicide for the earth and had a picture of the
[14:32.120 --> 14:37.200]  grim reaper leading so I mean this is soylent green taking you away to die
[14:37.200 --> 14:41.240]  but there's a whole nother wrinkle to this and we're gonna go over it when we
[14:41.240 --> 14:46.600]  come back after this quick break I'm I took my kids to Slytherba on the last
[14:46.600 --> 14:52.240]  day it's open drove back today get on the treadmill to jog turn on singing in
[14:52.240 --> 14:57.280]  and they've got a truth detector from lies to truth lies over on the green
[14:57.280 --> 15:02.280]  side read is a lie over on the left side and it was clearly slanted it said
[15:02.280 --> 15:07.600]  are there death panels lie do they restrict who you can see lie does it
[15:07.600 --> 15:13.800]  take over medical care lie does it restrict care to the old lie and I've
[15:13.800 --> 15:18.600]  read the bill it does all of that and but more importantly it gives the
[15:18.600 --> 15:24.040]  different federal departments the control to by fiat do whatever they want it
[15:24.040 --> 15:28.280]  gives them dictatorial power and allows them to take over health care and I've
[15:28.280 --> 15:33.160]  had medical doctors on probably what 20 times last few months or more gone over
[15:33.160 --> 15:38.760]  at all but but here they are in news week saying kill grandma and then I'm
[15:38.760 --> 15:42.960]  watching CNN and they're there pacifying people going none of this is true none of
[15:42.960 --> 15:47.000]  this is true none of this is true let me tell you what's true when we get back
[15:47.000 --> 15:52.080]  from these people's own sickening control freak mouth see in the religion of
[15:52.080 --> 15:56.120]  the control freak nothing gets them more exciting than killing people and
[15:56.120 --> 15:59.200]  deciding who lives and dies
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.280]  hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions if you're going
[16:04.280 --> 16:08.440]  into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm how much ammunition do you

[19:11.360 --> 19:15.480]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[19:15.480 --> 19:19.160]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[19:19.160 --> 19:23.480]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[19:23.480 --> 19:26.800]  dangerously overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[19:26.800 --> 19:30.760]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again every
[19:30.760 --> 19:34.440]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages number
[19:34.440 --> 19:38.440]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[19:38.440 --> 19:41.840]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[19:41.840 --> 19:45.200]  solutions from science a longtime sponsor of ours you can get more
[19:45.200 --> 19:51.880]  information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the
[19:51.880 --> 19:55.960]  government doesn't own the Sun yet so go to my solar backup.com or call toll
[19:55.960 --> 20:01.000]  free eight seven seven three two seven zero three six five
[20:13.800 --> 20:20.520]  if you go back to two thousand three hundred years ago and you read the
[20:20.520 --> 20:28.640]  writings of Plato and other philosophers they believe that Greece and the city
[20:28.640 --> 20:35.080]  states were overpopulated then and that war was necessary to reduce the numbers
[20:35.080 --> 20:41.760]  of the population who were quote this is from Plato crushing the breast of earth
[20:41.760 --> 20:48.360]  in fact if you search engine the term Plato crushing the breast of earth you
[20:48.360 --> 20:56.720]  can read where he wrote that in his tome his lengthy treatise Plato's
[20:56.720 --> 21:03.080]  Republic and Greek ideas then formed the Roman Empire they were picked up by the
[21:03.080 --> 21:08.440]  Egyptians they spread all over the world the term eugenics was taken from two
[21:08.440 --> 21:13.960]  Greek words now if you believe when there was a less than a million people on the
[21:13.960 --> 21:17.920]  earth total that we were overpopulated you believe we're overpopulated now when
[21:17.920 --> 21:23.680]  there are six billion 800 million people on the face of the planet this is a
[21:23.680 --> 21:29.120]  very sophisticated issue certainly and in very nuance certainly a lot of our
[21:29.120 --> 21:33.440]  technologies are dirty they do pollute the environment they hurt us they
[21:33.440 --> 21:40.760]  toxify homo sapien sapien not just fish not just birds not just other animals
[21:40.760 --> 21:44.720]  clearly cutting down a bunch of rainforests isn't good clearly we
[21:44.720 --> 21:51.800]  shouldn't clear cut the sequoias clearly conservation is a good idea but if you
[21:51.800 --> 21:56.840]  understand that the modern conservation movement was founded over a hundred
[21:56.840 --> 22:01.200]  years ago by the Rockefeller families and the British royal house of Saxe
[22:01.200 --> 22:06.640]  Coburg goth also known as Windsor that they openly have written that they
[22:06.640 --> 22:10.800]  would create an environmental movement to make people value the earth so that
[22:10.800 --> 22:16.200]  people wouldn't have as many children and so that quote neo feudalism they use
[22:16.200 --> 22:20.400]  this term I didn't coin it and surfdom could be brought back in if you study
[22:20.400 --> 22:28.280]  England 800 years ago 500 years ago 300 years ago France Japan 500 years ago
[22:28.280 --> 22:34.960]  200 years ago 100 years ago they had surf systems under a feudal system of
[22:34.960 --> 22:40.880]  government the people were basically slaves take England 500 years ago
[22:40.880 --> 22:47.760]  serfs were kept on about 2% of the land over 90% of the population they were
[22:47.760 --> 22:50.960]  called the little people by the royals because on average they were about two
[22:50.960 --> 22:57.600]  feet shorter due to bad nutrition than the nobles and the nobles wrote about
[22:57.600 --> 23:02.200]  how they would keep the people down and under their control Julia Caesar wrote
[23:02.200 --> 23:06.080]  about this too in areas they'd captured Germania gall Britannia all beyond
[23:06.080 --> 23:12.640]  other areas Judea they would use food as a weapon and they said if we keep the
[23:12.640 --> 23:17.440]  people at a subsistence level near starvation they won't breed too much so
[23:17.440 --> 23:24.040]  we have uprisings and they said they will be so weak and pathetic they won't be
[23:24.040 --> 23:28.960]  able to resist you and you can take the better ones as house slaves oh yeah they
[23:28.960 --> 23:33.600]  didn't invent house slaves in this country the Romans and Egyptians and
[23:33.600 --> 23:37.160]  Babylonians and others would take the best slaves for themselves into the
[23:37.160 --> 23:41.200]  house the rest were kept out on the plantations the Roman plantations and
[23:41.200 --> 23:47.360]  others and our entire plantation system came from Roman manuals you know study
[23:47.360 --> 23:51.160]  this in the history of us and also Caribbean Central South American slavery
[23:51.160 --> 23:57.840]  and the transatlantic slave trade that started about 485 years ago started
[23:57.840 --> 24:03.680]  about 500 plus but really got going about 485 years ago and so that system
[24:03.680 --> 24:07.680]  was brought here but with the African because whites said we can't enslave
[24:07.680 --> 24:14.280]  whites anymore even though in many provinces of what is Germany today like
[24:14.280 --> 24:23.440]  the main war province or county of Prussia up until only about 120 you look
[24:23.440 --> 24:33.440]  at 125 130 years forget the exact date Hessian Germans were slaves raised
[24:37.480 --> 24:46.880]  the the Hessian slaves were brought up to the war slaves that's where you get
[24:46.880 --> 24:52.400]  the term Hessian boots big black boots the Nazis Jack boots war war Prussian
[24:52.400 --> 24:56.080]  boots or Hessian boots and their uniforms were dark blue or dark gray
[24:56.080 --> 25:01.040]  hence the German army later once Germany was unified adopted the Prussian
[25:01.040 --> 25:06.160]  model of a slave army a warrior slave army so you have to understand the
[25:06.160 --> 25:10.600]  elites just a couple hundred years ago believed in this system of you of
[25:10.600 --> 25:17.520]  eugenics and they controlled their populations through serfdom through
[25:17.520 --> 25:24.120]  feudalism through total control and if you were caught even though your
[25:24.120 --> 25:28.760]  family was starving to death going off the tiny less than a half acre piece of
[25:28.760 --> 25:32.960]  property that each each serf in England had some areas it was even smaller and
[25:32.960 --> 25:37.440]  getting a rabbit picking up firewood even though your family was freezing to
[25:37.440 --> 25:45.920]  death you would be executed executed you weren't even allowed to own knives you
[25:45.920 --> 25:49.840]  would have a special little license leather license with a stamp on it with
[25:49.840 --> 25:54.280]  a brand on it to have a knife if you were in a noble service or a knife was
[25:54.280 --> 26:03.560]  needed so total control starving to death two feet shorter on average and
[26:03.560 --> 26:09.560]  the nobles enjoyed riding past the slaves they enjoyed calling them little
[26:09.560 --> 26:15.600]  people calling them dirty scum calling them trash calling them filth and then
[26:15.600 --> 26:20.320]  if you go back to the hundred years war and others you would have British
[26:20.320 --> 26:24.840]  kings riding to their Norman cousins in France saying we've got too many people
[26:24.840 --> 26:29.520]  too many mouths to feed we're having rebellions we need to have a war who's
[26:29.520 --> 26:33.600]  going to invade who this time and they even gave the British Brittany in
[26:33.600 --> 26:38.800]  France as a full-time landing zone where the French would let them land armies
[26:38.800 --> 26:42.400]  to attack them and it was just cousins saying we need to kill our slaves let's
[26:42.400 --> 26:48.040]  have a war I mean these are public mainstream history and I'm incorporating
[26:48.040 --> 26:54.520]  this into a future film but the issue is this that's why when Galton came along
[26:54.520 --> 26:59.560]  150 years ago and coined the term eugenics he was only scientifically
[26:59.560 --> 27:06.040]  codifying the social Darwinistic rationale for this control and saying we're
[27:06.040 --> 27:10.160]  killing we're enslaving we're poisoning the people for their own good
[27:10.160 --> 27:20.960]  because they're scum and they deserve it they are scum and they deserve it so you
[27:20.960 --> 27:25.960]  can argue that in Plato's time two thousand three hundred years ago that
[27:25.960 --> 27:31.960]  there were too many people you can argue today there are too many people but the
[27:31.960 --> 27:35.760]  issue is you need to also understand this is a cold-blooded system of control
[27:35.760 --> 27:39.800]  and from the elites perspective it's a way to dumb you down so you're more
[27:39.800 --> 27:45.520]  manageable and to call your numbers because human life has always been cheap
[27:45.520 --> 27:50.760]  but now human life is seen by the elites as a negative it is seen as something
[27:50.760 --> 27:57.080]  that is trash garbage it has a negative value that needs to be gotten rid of and
[27:57.080 --> 28:02.880]  then you get into the fact that once a country industrializes the population
[28:02.880 --> 28:07.240]  goes negative you have less people born than we're already living the Western
[28:07.240 --> 28:12.160]  world's average for every two adults is they have 1.3 children that is a
[28:12.160 --> 28:18.480]  extermination genocide rate already from Japan to the United States now for
[28:18.480 --> 28:23.000]  every Western nation and I've read eugenics documents like the 1949 Royal
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.520]  Commission on Population issued by his Royal Highness the King of England was
[28:28.520 --> 28:33.520]  right before Queen Elizabeth took the throne before he died and they said if
[28:33.520 --> 28:37.320]  we industrialize the third world they'll stop having as many kids but that
[28:37.320 --> 28:42.160]  will actually build them up so we'll make sure they keep having more kids for
[28:42.160 --> 28:45.960]  the next 30 40 years then we'll just euthanize and kill them with that with
[28:45.960 --> 28:50.520]  other weapons to keep their numbers down but it doesn't matter the average
[28:50.520 --> 28:53.520]  yuppie thinks people need to die the yuppie doesn't understand that they're
[28:53.520 --> 28:58.200]  in the cross-airs as well we'll come back stay with us

[33:39.640 --> 33:43.880]  as they got more and more corrupt use the gladiatorial events sporting events
[33:43.880 --> 33:47.720]  to distract and divert the population they didn't want men
[33:47.720 --> 33:51.240]  thinking of their identity as standing up for their families and freedom
[33:51.240 --> 33:54.680]  so they made their identity about sports and gladiatorial events
[33:54.680 --> 33:59.240]  and chariot races and they wrote about how they were controlling people
[33:59.240 --> 34:02.920]  and the more decadent as the society the more sports
[34:02.920 --> 34:08.360]  the more obsession with celebrity the same things are happening today
[34:08.360 --> 34:12.840]  and the white house science are openly calls for poisoning the water
[34:12.840 --> 34:16.760]  to sterilize you and your family to euthanize old people
[34:16.760 --> 34:21.560]  all of this in his own book eco science then you have the current
[34:21.560 --> 34:25.480]  issue of newsweek the case for killing granny
[34:25.480 --> 34:29.480]  curbing excessive end of life care is good for america
[34:29.480 --> 34:32.680]  so see all these years we told you when they call for legalizing
[34:32.680 --> 34:37.560]  euthanasia that's because in their own policy reports they want to force you to
[34:37.560 --> 34:40.680]  die they want to kill you not just give you the
[34:40.680 --> 34:45.160]  choice to take a bunch of pain pills or to take a bunch of
[34:45.160 --> 34:49.640]  drugs and die if you want that choice and now they're admitting
[34:49.640 --> 34:53.240]  that's what this is about and then you open up newsweek and they have a
[34:53.240 --> 34:59.640]  flashback to the article from the week before
[34:59.640 --> 35:03.720]  is your baby racist
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.960]  and then it just goes on to basically demonize and create more racial division
[35:09.960 --> 35:13.160]  and talk about the carbon footprint of your baby and
[35:13.160 --> 35:16.120]  how the west is evil and how we've got to have a lower standard
[35:16.120 --> 35:19.720]  but they're not going to raise the third world they're going to lower the third world
[35:19.720 --> 35:25.160]  and lower the united states and other western countries just like naftan gatt
[35:25.160 --> 35:28.760]  ross perot i've gone back and watched those debates between ross perot and al
[35:28.760 --> 35:36.200]  gore from larry king live uh back in 1994
[35:36.200 --> 35:40.600]  and perot's giving him statistics from other open borders trade deals
[35:40.600 --> 35:44.360]  where both the third world country and the first world country
[35:44.360 --> 35:49.400]  both have a standard of living drop and wages go down except for the top one
[35:49.400 --> 35:53.000]  tenth of one percent and that's the same thing that's now
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.640]  happening here now they gauge your recession by
[35:57.640 --> 36:00.760]  how the elite is doing and how the banks are doing well they're doing great
[36:00.760 --> 36:03.960]  they stole 23.7 trillion in the first 10 months
[36:03.960 --> 36:06.600]  since the bailout we haven't gotten the new numbers the last few months it'll be
[36:06.600 --> 36:09.320]  over 28 trillion with the way they've been stealing
[36:09.320 --> 36:12.280]  money unlimited the federal reserve won't say
[36:12.280 --> 36:16.600]  where the money went and my film fall the republic coming out october 21st
[36:16.600 --> 36:19.480]  covers all this
[36:21.320 --> 36:25.400]  it's just so mind-boggling to see him get away with all of this
[36:25.400 --> 36:29.480]  and to now hear them say the economy is good
[36:29.480 --> 36:36.440]  when the ultra rich are doing well and when the ultra rich are becoming even
[36:36.440 --> 36:39.800]  more wealthy and consolidating power and they're saying this is a jobless
[36:39.800 --> 36:43.640]  recovery so this is the new america and the new
[36:43.640 --> 36:48.280]  system worldwide where the banks implode the economy and the majority of your
[36:48.280 --> 36:52.120]  tax money goes to pay interest on debt because the tens of
[36:52.120 --> 36:54.440]  trillions that the united states and other countries have given to the
[36:54.440 --> 36:57.800]  private central banks we don't just give them that money we pay
[36:57.800 --> 37:02.920]  interest on them for the money we give them i'm not kidding
[37:03.800 --> 37:08.920]  so there you have it is your baby racist the case for killing granny it goes on
[37:08.920 --> 37:13.560]  and on now without even looking for this news the
[37:13.560 --> 37:17.880]  last few days it is just everywhere there they are brainwashing the entire
[37:17.880 --> 37:21.480]  public with eugenics and saying the earth will do better
[37:21.480 --> 37:24.760]  the economy will do better if we have less people
[37:24.760 --> 37:29.240]  and they're focusing this in the west where we already have a 1.3
[37:29.240 --> 37:33.960]  population uh replacement rate for every two parents they have 1.3
[37:33.960 --> 37:36.840]  children the united states is a 1.8 but if you take
[37:36.840 --> 37:42.280]  out the immigrant influx it's 1.3 now this is without looking for these
[37:42.280 --> 37:45.240]  headlines you can search engine the term babies
[37:45.240 --> 37:50.040]  climate change and you will get hundreds of articles per week
[37:50.040 --> 37:56.120]  this is ap birth control could help combat climate change
[37:56.120 --> 37:59.000]  as if climate change isn't normal with the seasons of the sun
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.360]  it's been proven that global warming man made as a fraud
[38:04.360 --> 38:07.160]  giving contraceptives to people in developing countries could help fight
[38:07.160 --> 38:09.960]  climate change by slowing population growth okay
[38:09.960 --> 38:15.240]  here's another one abc news huge population boom a massive challenge
[38:15.240 --> 38:18.760]  here's salon condoms against climate change
[38:18.760 --> 38:25.560]  here's the washington post when it comes to pollution less kids may be more
[38:28.680 --> 38:34.040]  and it says babies are the number one cause put a tax on having babies and
[38:34.040 --> 38:38.680]  they're already coming out saying put a tax on dogs
[38:38.680 --> 38:44.040]  in the united states that's in my stack because they're bad for climate change
[38:44.040 --> 38:49.480]  see number one carbon has this this this image of being dirty like it's
[38:49.480 --> 38:53.640]  soot carbon dioxide is a gas it's not carbon
[38:53.640 --> 38:58.120]  but they call it carbon and carbon dioxide is what plants breathe but they
[38:58.120 --> 39:02.200]  say we need more trees this is insane ladies and
[39:02.200 --> 39:06.440]  gentlemen it's totally made up and they brag the un brags by taxing carbon
[39:06.440 --> 39:11.080]  dioxide they control and can tax the entire biosphere
[39:11.080 --> 39:14.680]  they can tax all human activity on this planet and make it a crime and that's
[39:14.680 --> 39:17.800]  what the club of rome big un eugenics group says it's all
[39:17.800 --> 39:23.800]  about making humans the enemy now i'm done talking about that for
[39:23.800 --> 39:27.400]  now i would hope of all these dozens of callers
[39:27.400 --> 39:30.840]  that we've got that have called in here that some of you
[39:30.840 --> 39:34.600]  would want to talk about this issue but i know you'll be all over the map and
[39:34.600 --> 39:38.600]  that's fine then coming up next hour un
[39:38.600 --> 39:42.680]  shock report sline flu could kill millions pandemic
[39:42.680 --> 39:47.720]  may result in anarchy london observer
[39:47.720 --> 39:51.240]  and we're going to go over that article coming up in the
[39:51.240 --> 39:54.440]  next hour we're also going to get into what's really
[39:54.440 --> 39:58.280]  happening with the economy and obama as i said he would do
[39:58.280 --> 40:01.400]  in january and as we put my film that came out
[40:01.400 --> 40:05.800]  in march the obama deception calling for a new bank of the world
[40:05.800 --> 40:11.160]  you pay your carbon taxes too everything you do you'll have a tax
[40:11.160 --> 40:14.600]  added to be paid to a new private international bank
[40:14.600 --> 40:19.080]  the same banks that bankrupted us now get total power out of what they created
[40:19.080 --> 40:22.200]  and he's saying that's the only way to save the economy and that's in bloomberg
[40:22.200 --> 40:26.440]  and ap so that is coming up right now let's go to sam
[40:26.440 --> 40:32.280]  in florida sam you're on the air all right alex i just got a couple quick
[40:32.280 --> 40:36.600]  questions i wanted to ask you one instead of uh you know i feel like i got
[40:36.600 --> 40:41.240]  i'm living in a school room and i have to go to school every day
[40:41.240 --> 40:44.360]  and i've got a bully sitting across the room from me saying he's going to kick
[40:44.360 --> 40:46.760]  my butt he's going to kick my butt every day
[40:46.760 --> 40:50.440]  do you eventually go over and confront the kid and just punch him in the head
[40:50.440 --> 40:54.200]  and get it over with or do you run from school and don't go back to class
[40:54.200 --> 40:57.960]  that's what i feel like i'm up against against the new world order here
[40:57.960 --> 41:01.880]  okay here's the deal here's the deal if we weren't having any success waking
[41:01.880 --> 41:06.440]  people up in mass every i tune in to talk radio tv everybody's
[41:06.440 --> 41:09.640]  starting to learn what eugenics means they're starting to find out about the
[41:09.640 --> 41:13.480]  world government we're beating the carbon tax we're beating the north american
[41:13.480 --> 41:17.640]  union they're still coming on but we're we're we're stalling them we're
[41:17.640 --> 41:20.680]  having big victories if we weren't having victories
[41:20.680 --> 41:24.360]  against so much of what was happening we wouldn't have a choice
[41:24.360 --> 41:28.760]  as they pressed in on us with their tyranny but to resist but because
[41:28.760 --> 41:33.320]  we're waking so many people up peacefully because the military and police
[41:33.320 --> 41:37.000]  and other people are waking up in record numbers ron paul got more political
[41:37.000 --> 41:40.040]  contributions than any other political candidate in both parties
[41:40.040 --> 41:45.000]  another sign that people are waking up we don't want things to be violent the
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.360]  fed stage nine eleven and oklahoma city and other terror
[41:48.360 --> 41:53.400]  events to be able to use the police state apparatus against the public
[41:53.400 --> 41:58.120]  so they want violence so whoever fires first loses
[41:58.120 --> 42:02.840]  so no you don't want it you don't want to go get in a shooting war
[42:02.840 --> 42:06.920]  besides let's say you go have a shooting war with local police
[42:06.920 --> 42:10.680]  you get killed they get killed the cops are just totally mind controlled like
[42:10.680 --> 42:13.640]  the general public they don't know what eugenics is
[42:13.640 --> 42:17.240]  they don't know about john p holdren they don't understand when they see news
[42:17.240 --> 42:22.200]  week saying kill grandma what that means or the or i mean they may not like it
[42:22.200 --> 42:26.120]  but they don't understand that pure evil is now being sold
[42:26.120 --> 42:29.320]  ok hitler was man of the year and time magazine twice he was
[42:29.320 --> 42:33.400]  worshiped by the left in this country i've gone to the film archives and pulled
[42:33.400 --> 42:37.560]  all the top left worshiping him because he was a eugenicist
[42:37.560 --> 42:42.120]  we're gonna beat these people but does that answer your question

[48:03.000 --> 48:06.280]  life it's going to be federal grants just like
[48:06.280 --> 48:10.440]  taking blood without warrants in texas is a federal grant
[48:10.440 --> 48:13.720]  first it was they took it with a fake warrant now no warrant
[48:13.720 --> 48:17.720]  into the fourth amendment just total tyranny now they come out and say we're
[48:17.720 --> 48:20.760]  going to have every town and city they're going to have a list of thousands

[48:24.680 --> 48:28.760]  selling a toy a wagon something you have no idea
[48:28.760 --> 48:32.840]  most parents don't read the recalls on toys from 10 years ago
[48:32.840 --> 48:36.680]  five years ago a year ago you're selling a wagon you're selling a toy you're
[48:36.680 --> 48:42.600]  selling a table uh and oh hundred thousand dollar fine

[48:46.600 --> 48:49.800]  this is all about folks they're going to micromanage
[48:49.800 --> 48:54.040]  every area environmental home inspections environmental fines and fees
[48:54.040 --> 48:57.160]  environmental bureaucrats visiting your house

[49:01.960 --> 49:05.560]  that was written up several years ago now being enforced
[49:05.560 --> 49:10.920]  uh by big agribusiness because they want to shut down small farms and ranches
[49:10.920 --> 49:14.360]  they want to shut down local communities they want to shut down
[49:14.360 --> 49:17.720]  garage sales and flea markets and they're going to raid people
[49:17.720 --> 49:24.120]  and they're a couple years in prison you can read the entire quote handbook for
[49:24.120 --> 49:28.120]  resale stores and product resellers and garage sales
[49:28.120 --> 49:32.280]  prison time 15 million dollar fine in fact zoom in on that for folks right
[49:32.280 --> 49:39.720]  there 15 million dollar fine
[49:39.720 --> 49:44.360]  again for radio listeners we saw will cast on the web at prisonplanet.tv the
[49:44.360 --> 49:47.480]  radio show doubles as a tv show so that's not confusing
[49:47.480 --> 49:50.520]  okay let's go back to your calls it's just this is the type of news i have
[49:50.520 --> 49:55.320]  here the u n's taken over the internet the us control of it ends in just a
[49:55.320 --> 49:58.520]  few weeks they're openly saying the fcc domestically
[49:58.520 --> 50:02.040]  is going to restrict free speech on talk radio and internet
[50:02.040 --> 50:07.400]  the fcc diversity czar says he wants the same type of regulation they have in
[50:07.400 --> 50:11.720]  venezuela i mean of course this radio show is getting
[50:11.720 --> 50:15.800]  huge of course info wars and prison planet are climbing the charts now
[50:15.800 --> 50:20.120]  together bigger than world net daily coming up on the drudge report
[50:20.120 --> 50:22.920]  at current growth rates within the next 14 months
[50:22.920 --> 50:27.960]  but i'm not happy about that because it means i was right about everything
[50:27.960 --> 50:31.960]  and we were reading the documents correctly and now everybody's freaking
[50:31.960 --> 50:35.080]  out well you should be freaking out i'm freaking out

[50:45.400 --> 50:48.680]  natural compulsory service a new domestic draft that's
[50:48.680 --> 50:54.920]  introduced with massive cosponsorship it's all happening now
[50:54.920 --> 50:58.520]  they want in every that's what the airports are about the feds admit
[50:58.520 --> 51:02.920]  searching you making you take your shoes off it's about training you to line up
[51:02.920 --> 51:08.040]  be a slave be body scanned it's about making normal people
[51:08.040 --> 51:11.960]  who aren't criminals feel like they're criminals this is a total
[51:11.960 --> 51:17.480]  criminal takeover of society and a lot of you are laughing right now but when
[51:17.480 --> 51:21.160]  you get that hundred thousand dollar fine and then they'll go okay well just
[51:21.160 --> 51:25.400]  pay ten thousand we'll drop your fee and you'll you'll plead guilty and get
[51:25.400 --> 51:29.480]  probation and think you got away with something for selling a toy you had no
[51:29.480 --> 51:34.120]  idea had led in it meanwhile the FDA says it's okay to put melamine in the
[51:34.120 --> 51:38.040]  milk meanwhile the washington post reports half
[51:38.040 --> 51:43.160]  of corn syrup products that's the headline 50% of corn syrup products
[51:43.160 --> 51:46.760]  have high levels of mercury they don't care
[51:46.760 --> 51:51.000]  they put poison in the water on purpose
[51:51.000 --> 51:55.800]  all right i'm gonna stop ranting victoria in virginia you're on the air
[51:55.800 --> 51:59.880]  hi alex i have two quick things for you um one
[51:59.880 --> 52:03.960]  i have a relative that works in in a medical profession in the state of north
[52:03.960 --> 52:07.400]  dakota and she said that on friday some people came
[52:07.400 --> 52:12.360]  into the hospital and offered the h1n1 fine flu shot
[52:12.360 --> 52:16.520]  so the nurses there and everyone took it except a few people and of course she
[52:16.520 --> 52:19.560]  didn't take it because i told her what i heard on the show
[52:19.560 --> 52:24.840]  so she said immediately two of the nurses had very negative reactions
[52:24.840 --> 52:28.040]  both of them lost most of the mobility in the arm
[52:28.040 --> 52:31.320]  that they had the shot in and then one of them broke out
[52:31.320 --> 52:35.160]  in a red rash and everything and was in a lot of pain
[52:35.160 --> 52:39.000]  and there won't be there probably won't be any having kids for them either
[52:39.000 --> 52:43.880]  i know and and uh and she said that she took benadryl and the field did not
[52:43.880 --> 52:47.240]  help her well let me just tell you there's an internal
[52:47.240 --> 52:51.560]  what you need to give the nurses is this is just search engine
[52:51.560 --> 52:59.480]  secret cdc report brain damage vaccine and they admit that they know
[52:59.480 --> 53:03.400]  that it has caused it in the past and is causing it there's a reuters article
[53:03.400 --> 53:06.840]  in fact get bermas to reprint it i forget the headline saying get ready for a
[53:06.840 --> 53:09.880]  bunch of deaths but it's not going to be from the vaccine you're just going to
[53:09.880 --> 53:13.640]  think it is here's the good news
[53:13.640 --> 53:18.840]  in new york over 50 of the nurses have said no that was in the ap and a lot of
[53:18.840 --> 53:22.520]  people in europe are saying no but yes i'm going to talk about flu next hour
[53:22.520 --> 53:26.200]  what did she think i mean did the nurses get freaked out when suddenly their arms
[53:26.200 --> 53:30.040]  got paralyzed absolutely they were very freaked out
[53:30.040 --> 53:33.960]  and everything and um you know and and i'm glad she listened to me because i
[53:33.960 --> 53:37.640]  begged her not to take the shot and she listened to me but as a result she's not
[53:37.640 --> 53:41.160]  like the the other ladies but i'm going to keep you posted on what
[53:41.160 --> 53:44.280]  happened to them uh because she said one of them uh
[53:44.280 --> 53:48.120]  didn't even get to come back uh the work the uh next day so i don't know what's
[53:48.120 --> 53:50.760]  going on with her well here's the deal we've had top
[53:50.760 --> 53:54.680]  scientists brain surgeons virologist on and they've said
[53:54.680 --> 53:57.800]  that the adjuvants keyword write that down folks
[53:57.800 --> 54:02.520]  adjuvants they put record squalene adjuvant that makes
[54:02.520 --> 54:05.960]  your body have an autoimmune response so that they can use
[54:05.960 --> 54:12.680]  less of the uh attenuated flu virus the h1n1 and they they tried the last time
[54:12.680 --> 54:16.680]  they tried large amounts of adjuvants squalene based
[54:16.680 --> 54:20.200]  in the late nineties and early 2000s with troops
[54:20.200 --> 54:24.440]  with the small smallpox and anthrax but mainly anthrax shot
[54:24.440 --> 54:27.640]  this is like mainstream news it killed a bunch of troops
[54:27.640 --> 54:31.400]  and caused others to have autoimmune responses and become partially paralyzed
[54:31.400 --> 54:35.320]  fully paralyzed or to have brain disorders and die
[54:35.320 --> 54:39.240]  their bodies attack their own brainstem and and literally ate the brainstem
[54:39.240 --> 54:43.240]  turned into like yogurt you know liquefied it
[54:43.240 --> 54:50.680]  now this is the key this vaccine has there's five different companies
[54:50.680 --> 54:55.560]  but conservatively has doubled the adjuvant and some of the batches have
[54:55.560 --> 55:01.320]  five times that's mainstream news five times the adjuvant
[55:01.320 --> 55:05.560]  so you're i mean this is really a test to see if they can screw everybody up
[55:05.560 --> 55:09.720]  kill a bunch of people hurt a bunch of people and then nobody gets in trouble
[55:09.720 --> 55:14.600]  and and and the media just soft soaps it and white washes it and makes excuses
[55:14.600 --> 55:18.360]  this is all a big beta test to see what they can get away with just what did i
[55:18.360 --> 55:25.320]  say three years ago from the studies we knew that Gardasil was killing a large
[55:25.320 --> 55:29.400]  percentage a large minority and paralyzing many others
[55:29.400 --> 55:35.400]  and causing huge brain swelling with the human papillomavirus Gardasil
[55:35.400 --> 55:38.440]  now since then it's all over the news it's hurting people
[55:38.440 --> 55:41.800]  they don't care they were given government liability protection
[55:41.800 --> 55:45.640]  now again i i didn't pull this out of my hat
[55:45.640 --> 55:50.760]  it was in the trials and i had women on one woman whose daughter died another
[55:50.760 --> 55:54.600]  woman whose daughter was paralyzed a 13 year old cheerleader in perfect shape
[55:54.600 --> 56:00.280]  they get paralyzed rashes break out then blood starts pouring out the rashes
[56:00.280 --> 56:03.640]  and now you just search engine the term or go to youtube
[56:03.640 --> 56:08.280]  girl dies from Gardasil and you'll see local newscasts it never makes it
[56:08.280 --> 56:12.040]  national all over the country this woman going i gave
[56:12.040 --> 56:15.480]  my 14 year old the shot and she's dead a week later
[56:15.480 --> 56:21.000]  i mean man this is massive but do you see what i'm saying
[56:21.000 --> 56:24.360]  terrible and the other one i wanted to tell you about was like in the state of
[56:24.360 --> 56:28.440]  florida the criminal justice system is changing the laws
[56:28.440 --> 56:31.720]  to make up any kind of criminal charges to arrest people
[56:31.720 --> 56:35.240]  and then once they put them in the jail they feed them toxic chemicals
[56:35.240 --> 56:38.680]  in their food and then the drinks they give them and then
[56:38.680 --> 56:42.120]  they're sterile they can't have children after that
[56:42.120 --> 56:46.200]  well now that was they did catch him in alabama doing that with black men
[56:46.200 --> 56:49.960]  uh with several studies not just askegee uh but
[56:49.960 --> 56:53.720]  uh huntsville texas it came out in the houston chronicle
[56:53.720 --> 56:57.640]  the jail guards finally complained because the bio weapons they were testing
[56:57.640 --> 57:01.640]  on the people in huntsville got into the guards and then into huntsville
[57:01.640 --> 57:05.320]  uh in east texas so yes ma'am um look
[57:05.320 --> 57:09.480]  you'd look they're in newsweek saying kill
[57:09.480 --> 57:13.640]  old people and and and then when we say hey the health plan wants to
[57:13.640 --> 57:16.600]  keep care from old people they call us conspiracy theorist
[57:16.600 --> 57:20.520]  but then out of the same side of their mouth these control freak eugenicist
[57:20.520 --> 57:25.080]  posing as leftist say let's get rid of grandma the case for killing granny
[57:25.080 --> 57:29.320]  with an image of a plug pulled out of the wall ladies and gentlemen

[1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:43.320]  commission how they were outside their jurisdiction from the very
[1:09:43.320 --> 1:09:46.440]  beginning code enforcement should have driven up
[1:09:46.440 --> 1:09:51.240]  looked saw that the the yard sign was on the man's property and driven off
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:54.760]  they have two prongs that they can use under police powers
[1:09:54.760 --> 1:10:00.920]  if the sign was morally uh offensive or if it was impeding traffic now
[1:10:00.920 --> 1:10:06.600]  failing those three you know his private property offensive or impeding
[1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:10.760]  they should have left and then turn to call whoever wasn't made the complaint
[1:10:10.760 --> 1:10:15.320]  say sorry it's not my jurisdiction but no it's policy like you say this
[1:10:15.320 --> 1:10:18.440]  country is being run by policy not the written law
[1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:22.760]  power tripping people yes send it to writers and info wars dot com double

[1:10:27.400 --> 1:10:32.920]  look the bad police get promoted i mean in texas they take blood without
[1:10:32.920 --> 1:10:36.440]  warrants now i mean and you can make all your
[1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:39.480]  excuses all day for those of you that love this
[1:10:39.480 --> 1:10:43.080]  this is all so foreign banks can literally rape the daylights out of you
[1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:45.640]  so get ready all you people that love licking boots and
[1:10:45.640 --> 1:10:50.360]  love the system i mean i've got mainstream news here
[1:10:50.360 --> 1:10:54.920]  from the washington post dc cop secret service closed down streets conduct
[1:10:54.920 --> 1:10:59.080]  sweeps so michelle obama can shop
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:04.200]  and it goes on i mean that's what goes on in this country
[1:11:04.200 --> 1:11:07.560]  we live in a third world country let's go ahead and talk to steve and houston
[1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:11.400]  steve you're on the air yeah good afternoon alex uh
[1:11:11.400 --> 1:11:16.280]  earlier this week you were asking which the uh you know issue we thought was the
[1:11:16.280 --> 1:11:21.240]  most important face that we're facing i got three and i want to highlight the
[1:11:21.240 --> 1:11:24.280]  third one especially because it ties in with eugenics
[1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:28.680]  first of all there's the economic this is the task master system to enslave the
[1:11:28.680 --> 1:11:32.440]  population at what they admit they're bankrupting things to make you dependent
[1:11:32.440 --> 1:11:34.840]  on them
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:40.360]  from that way via abject poverty where they must then depend upon the rulers
[1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:43.800]  for survival uh the second one is the political
[1:11:43.800 --> 1:11:48.520]  this is a total police state control grid to enforce this enslavement
[1:11:48.520 --> 1:11:53.000]  ensuring that the slaves are kept in line quote unquote and the economy is
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:57.240]  built in the economy's built into the police state right and therefore they
[1:11:57.240 --> 1:12:01.880]  obey whatever their masters tell them no matter how unreasonable or abusive it
[1:12:01.880 --> 1:12:06.280]  is and then the third one and for me this is the most dangerous this is the
[1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:10.920]  social religious one and this is the quasi spiritual program
[1:12:10.920 --> 1:12:15.320]  that appeals to man's social religious nature using emotionally oriented
[1:12:15.320 --> 1:12:18.840]  propaganda and philosophy that's right the new religion
[1:12:18.840 --> 1:12:22.840]  is the green religion which isn't green at all it's about making humans the
[1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:26.120]  enemy killing grandma is wonderful they say you know
[1:12:26.120 --> 1:12:29.880]  they always say tom dashill wrote a book saying we're not going to give old
[1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:32.360]  people care i have the book i have the quotes it's been in
[1:12:32.360 --> 1:12:36.360]  bloomberg then when you say hey you said you want death panels they go what are
[1:12:36.360 --> 1:12:39.240]  you talking about i'm talking about this you bastard
[1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:45.720]  newsweek the case for killing grandma granny and then it says it's good
[1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:50.360]  go ahead passes the thinking process and influences the slaves without their
[1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:54.600]  knowledge yet with their total cooperation ensuring they remain dumb
[1:12:54.600 --> 1:12:58.920]  down docile slaves who cannot and will not fight and
[1:12:58.920 --> 1:13:03.080]  this is what i wanted to get to for me the worst part of this whole thing is
[1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:07.160]  eugenics it is a religion these people are satanist
[1:13:07.160 --> 1:13:11.880]  we are their sacrament their sacrament this is about human sacrifice you know
[1:13:11.880 --> 1:13:15.960]  what's said 95 you know what's said what's that
[1:13:15.960 --> 1:13:20.840]  the 1996 united nations biological diversity assessment you can go to un
[1:13:20.840 --> 1:13:27.880]  uh dot org and read it says that it is their religious sacrament for gaya
[1:13:27.880 --> 1:13:31.320]  and they say it's a form of human sacrifice it's in my film
[1:13:31.320 --> 1:13:34.760]  road to tyranny you can watch it free online or get the dvd from us but the
[1:13:34.760 --> 1:13:39.480]  point is we have close-ups of it blown up these people are lunatics
[1:13:39.480 --> 1:13:44.040]  and see ask the reason i see the third one the social religious as the most
[1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:47.800]  dangerous it's because it's the most subtle the economic and political ones
[1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:52.040]  those are more in your face people know there's something going on economically
[1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:55.400]  police state that's being set up that's out in the open now but the
[1:13:55.400 --> 1:13:58.920]  third one it's very subtle because look at eugenics okay
[1:13:58.920 --> 1:14:02.360]  they poison the water supply they poison the food supply
[1:14:02.360 --> 1:14:06.600]  they poison the vaccines with cancer viruses the most deadly strain of the
[1:14:06.600 --> 1:14:10.920]  bird flu virus they got the propaganda out there with the swine flu hoax
[1:14:10.920 --> 1:14:14.120]  to get people to take the shots and that's what will kill them
[1:14:14.120 --> 1:14:18.200]  and then they say the pandemic was caused by a regular flu virus when it's
[1:14:18.200 --> 1:14:22.360]  them injecting in it people and then you've got them spraying us overhead
[1:14:22.360 --> 1:14:25.560]  via chem trails and so you know this whole thing

[1:25:30.680 --> 1:25:35.080]  hey alex i just wanted to uh... thank you for your contribution to humanity
[1:25:35.080 --> 1:25:38.360]  uh... for waking me up in all areas including vaccinations
[1:25:38.360 --> 1:25:41.400]  which i have not allowed our newborn to be shut up with
[1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:44.600]  uh... you are my only source of news i do understand that sometimes you get
[1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:48.680]  passionate and loud but i as well as others know that you are true in your
[1:25:48.680 --> 1:25:52.680]  passion and can look past your outburst look we need to find our humanity
[1:25:52.680 --> 1:25:56.920]  people get mad about their team losing or winning people should get upset
[1:25:56.920 --> 1:26:01.320]  about the nazi type stuff going on but that's one thing i've noticed man as i
[1:26:01.320 --> 1:26:04.120]  talked to more and more people about that i was the gun show today
[1:26:04.120 --> 1:26:07.000]  and just randomly listening to people's conversations they're all talking about
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:10.680]  taking away the guns so they're open at least on that front at gun shows
[1:26:10.680 --> 1:26:13.800]  but uh... you know if people were to take five seconds
[1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:17.000]  instead of looking at their sports teams on espn and look up the definition of
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:19.400]  fluoride sodium fluoride find out that
[1:26:19.400 --> 1:26:23.480]  alcoa you know it's a five it's a hazardous waste
[1:26:23.480 --> 1:26:27.960]  and they put it's between a hundred and thirty and three hundred plus chemicals
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:32.600]  that term fluoride is between a hundred and thirty and three hundred plus
[1:26:32.600 --> 1:26:36.440]  chemicals they dump in the water just like other spices that you'll see on
[1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:39.880]  some of your foods that can be up to fifteen thousand different ingredients
[1:26:39.880 --> 1:26:45.320]  msg yeah i'll all that kind of stuff you know nobody that i know would actually
[1:26:45.320 --> 1:26:49.880]  take a shot glass full of uh... straight fluoride or straight pouring but
[1:26:49.880 --> 1:26:53.160]  they'll drink it and bathe it, bathe it every day in their water and here's the

[1:33:19.560 --> 1:33:24.440]  one alternative radio show slash films websites

[1:33:43.560 --> 1:33:47.720]  but i didn't get on the air 14 years ago
[1:33:47.720 --> 1:33:51.640]  and start ranting and raving knowing that that would get the listeners
[1:33:51.640 --> 1:33:58.120]  i am fundamentally angry you know i sat there we went down to
[1:33:58.120 --> 1:34:03.560]  with my parents and my kids to barbecue and hang out outside by the river
[1:34:03.560 --> 1:34:07.240]  and to go to slitter bond and and and tube and stuff
[1:34:07.240 --> 1:34:10.200]  they're in the co-mall
[1:34:10.760 --> 1:34:14.840]  and so we watch the football game my mom's an intelligent smart great person
[1:34:14.840 --> 1:34:19.480]  and she just gets so excited and so focused and so upset
[1:34:19.480 --> 1:34:23.560]  when ut fumbles the ball or doesn't do good and
[1:34:23.560 --> 1:34:26.280]  and i know she knows about all this other stuff and and i look at that i
[1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:30.040]  think here is everybody else in my family
[1:34:30.040 --> 1:34:33.880]  is the same way and and everybody in my mom in my wife's family
[1:34:33.880 --> 1:34:37.800]  and everybody i know people that work in this office a lot of them are
[1:34:37.800 --> 1:34:42.040]  the greatest passion in their life is sports even though they know about all
[1:34:42.040 --> 1:34:46.120]  this and all i'm saying is yours get excited the
[1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:50.520]  sociologist a hundred years ago wrote that they would build
[1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:53.960]  giant stadiums everywhere and get people obsessed with sports to take our
[1:34:53.960 --> 1:34:56.760]  normal tribal concern for our families in our
[1:34:56.760 --> 1:35:01.560]  communities and misplace it onto sports if you look
[1:35:01.560 --> 1:35:06.840]  at television 50 plus years ago becoming popular overnight and sociologists
[1:35:06.840 --> 1:35:09.720]  have written a lot of white papers on this it's in my new film fall the
[1:35:09.720 --> 1:35:12.920]  republic coming out in october we covered some
[1:35:12.920 --> 1:35:17.480]  we're gonna cover more in a future film on mind control itself
[1:35:17.480 --> 1:35:22.040]  and we quote the sociologist who bragged that they use sports to control
[1:35:22.040 --> 1:35:27.720]  people your your passion your tribal passion for war
[1:35:27.720 --> 1:35:31.080]  should be about being free not about a team
[1:35:31.080 --> 1:35:35.320]  how a team's doing and that's why it fundamentally upsets me so bad
[1:35:35.320 --> 1:35:39.160]  it's normal to yell and scream for a football team but then i yell and scream
[1:35:39.160 --> 1:35:43.480]  over newsweek saying the case for killing granny
[1:35:43.480 --> 1:35:47.080]  and it tells you basically eugenics is good we got to kill the old people
[1:35:47.080 --> 1:35:50.360]  this doesn't upset anybody
[1:35:51.160 --> 1:35:54.600]  the white house scientists are saying we need to have a one child policy and
[1:35:54.600 --> 1:35:57.800]  only be allowed to have one kid or put a tax on children
[1:35:57.800 --> 1:36:01.240]  and all over the world australia's on the verge of passing a law
[1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:06.200]  china has one that the u.s funded in 1975 under treaty
[1:36:06.200 --> 1:36:12.040]  became law in 1981 started as a tax then became a law
[1:36:12.040 --> 1:36:16.760]  i'm upset about that i know the big picture
[1:36:16.760 --> 1:36:20.440]  i'm somebody whose head is screwed on straight i read government documents
[1:36:20.440 --> 1:36:24.200]  saying they're going to take my guns try to take my children
[1:36:24.200 --> 1:36:28.280]  term bureaucracies loose on me for the smallest environmental
[1:36:28.280 --> 1:36:33.080]  infraction huge fines years in prison now it's going to happen with the garage
[1:36:33.080 --> 1:36:36.120]  sales under environmental laws two years in prison
[1:36:36.120 --> 1:36:41.240]  hundred thousand dollar fine first infraction 15 million second infraction
[1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:45.160]  that upsets me i know what tyranny is i know the value
[1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:50.360]  of liberty and i just want to get people upset
[1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:56.040]  and focused on real issues here how can you be normal
[1:36:56.040 --> 1:36:59.640]  and know this and not get upset
[1:36:59.640 --> 1:37:05.240]  but i read the sociology papers written in the 50s 60s and 70s and there have
[1:37:05.240 --> 1:37:10.200]  been newer ones written where they brag how up until the 50s in england and the
[1:37:10.200 --> 1:37:14.680]  united states and canada parks were always full of families
[1:37:14.680 --> 1:37:18.040]  people played in their front yards they knew their neighbors they went down and
[1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:22.520]  talked about politics at the barbershop but as soon as television came in
[1:37:22.520 --> 1:37:25.240]  within a week of communities getting tv
[1:37:25.240 --> 1:37:31.160]  no one was outside anymore it was rare they killed our humanity
[1:37:31.160 --> 1:37:35.560]  so i use the television to try to reach in as a life preserver through their
[1:37:35.560 --> 1:37:39.800]  system and to warn people that's why we've got fall the
[1:37:39.800 --> 1:37:43.000]  republic coming out that's why i made the obama deception that's why i've made
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:46.600]  all these films that's why i do six days of radio that's why i'm
[1:37:46.600 --> 1:37:50.680]  going to be here till midnight all week long working
[1:37:50.680 --> 1:37:56.760]  because i morally can't sit on my butt and not do something about this i have
[1:37:56.760 --> 1:37:59.480]  to get angry and get focused and do everything i can
[1:37:59.480 --> 1:38:04.440]  to beat these people that's why i also consulted on and one of the main

[1:40:12.200 --> 1:40:15.960]  this will happen every single year whether without the swine flu vaccine
[1:40:15.960 --> 1:40:18.680]  so they're telling the doctors if somebody gets sick or dies after they
[1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:21.640]  take this it the vaccine didn't kill you now how
[1:40:21.640 --> 1:40:24.760]  obvious when there's been all these other problems in the past with vaccines
[1:40:24.760 --> 1:40:28.600]  yet this year they know a significant number will be blamed on h1n1 vaccine
[1:40:28.600 --> 1:40:33.880]  which will roll out within weeks and they're struggling to be ready
[1:40:33.880 --> 1:40:37.240]  they expect an avalanche of so-called adverse event reports which are
[1:40:37.240 --> 1:40:40.040]  reports of death illness or other health trauma
[1:40:40.040 --> 1:40:43.320]  that occur within two weeks after receiving treatment in this case

[1:41:01.960 --> 1:41:05.560]  global pandemic so the us and other countries are under un control
[1:41:05.560 --> 1:41:08.840]  the un brags this is all a drill at least at bare minimum
[1:41:08.840 --> 1:41:12.440]  to train all the major nation states to go under un control
[1:41:12.440 --> 1:41:17.000]  un report says pandemic may result in anarchy unless western world pays for

[1:47:19.720 --> 1:47:23.880]  and crashed with the lies and disinformation
[1:47:23.880 --> 1:47:27.080]  on the last official day of summer september 20th
[1:47:27.080 --> 1:47:31.960]  line number one there are no adjuvants used in the vaccines though they admit
[1:47:31.960 --> 1:47:35.880]  there's massive mercury which is an adjuvant and squalene at record levels
[1:47:35.880 --> 1:47:39.320]  line number two the swine flu is more dangerous than seasonal flu
[1:47:39.320 --> 1:47:42.200]  that's not true we have all the hyperlinks to that line number three
[1:47:42.200 --> 1:47:45.960]  vaccines protect you from the swine flu when they admit it's already mutated
[1:47:45.960 --> 1:47:51.320]  and didn't protect you vaccines are safe how can the journalists be saying this
[1:47:51.320 --> 1:47:54.520]  when there's a huge history of them killing people and naming people
[1:47:54.520 --> 1:47:58.920]  line number five that the vaccine isn't mandatory
[1:47:58.920 --> 1:48:02.280]  and they're certainly pushing it and implying it is in many workplaces and in
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:06.680]  schools with color of law number six getting a vaccine shot is a good bet
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:11.240]  on your health it goes on line number seven the
[1:48:11.240 --> 1:48:14.280]  vaccine isn't made with attenuated live virus

[1:48:19.400 --> 1:48:23.320]  almost all of it is inhaled through the nose into the mucus membrane
[1:48:23.320 --> 1:48:29.160]  line number nine children are more vulnerable to swine flu than adults
[1:48:29.160 --> 1:48:33.560]  line number ten there is nothing else you can do beyond a vaccine or tamiflu
[1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:38.200]  when all the medical doctors we've had on have said vitamin d is the key
[1:48:38.200 --> 1:48:41.320]  several times a week at at least 30 minutes of direct sun on your body
[1:48:41.320 --> 1:48:45.800]  that's what produces it in the body the real type your body can absorb
[1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:51.080]  not to mention getting lots of sleep lots of vitamin c
[1:48:51.080 --> 1:48:55.000]  every time i have medical doctors on i say what do you do get a lot of sleep
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:58.440]  eat healthy don't drink don't smoke and get a lot of sun

[1:50:23.320 --> 1:50:27.160]  much less whites and so under the different laws
[1:50:27.160 --> 1:50:31.720]  they created marriage licenses and that was set up by ugenesis as well
[1:50:31.720 --> 1:50:35.560]  the family courts that are outside due process and aren't legitimate
[1:50:35.560 --> 1:50:39.320]  they were set up for eugenics

[1:51:44.440 --> 1:51:48.680]  yeah and it's like they're like praising china
[1:51:48.680 --> 1:51:53.160]  for all their accomplishments on eugenics at the same time it's just
[1:51:53.160 --> 1:51:58.520]  and he calls for a planetary world he calls for a planetary regime to enforce

[1:53:30.760 --> 1:53:34.280]  we interviewed thomas sanchez the emergency management head he said
[1:53:34.280 --> 1:53:38.120]  look i'm a vietnam vet i'm going to tell the truth they told us this is for
[1:53:38.120 --> 1:53:42.040]  gun confiscation drills so when the feds really take over the people go
[1:53:42.040 --> 1:53:44.680]  along with it then they tried to bribe the san antonio
[1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:48.600]  police chief i went and interviewed him and then the austin american statesman
[1:53:48.600 --> 1:53:53.000]  attacked me and said that i was telling the truth
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:57.640]  but that i was still a kook but yes that's the martial law takeover drills
[1:53:57.640 --> 1:54:01.880]  but you live there unannounced tell folks what that was like
[1:54:01.880 --> 1:54:05.960]  oh it was absolutely scary we've been listening to you we've been hearing
[1:54:05.960 --> 1:54:09.560]  about this but to actually see it come down and to actually see
[1:54:09.560 --> 1:54:14.360]  the black helicopter is a black bug the bus and to see the men coming down in
[1:54:14.360 --> 1:54:19.320]  their black suit yes that uh it definitely did happen
[1:54:19.320 --> 1:54:22.600]  they're in every town and most towns take the money
[1:54:22.600 --> 1:54:25.960]  when the police chief said no i won't have you here for secret drills to scare
[1:54:25.960 --> 1:54:29.480]  people for acclimation they brought into city officials satchels of
[1:54:29.480 --> 1:54:35.320]  hundred dollar bills and said just work with the arming keep the money
[1:54:35.320 --> 1:54:39.400]  exactly and it's not just in this state it's happened in other states as well
[1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:43.720]  and the different they fired into a restaurant almost killed people
[1:54:43.720 --> 1:54:49.160]  uh in miami that's right and it's been on the west coast so
[1:54:49.160 --> 1:54:53.000]  or again washington things like this have happened all the time and then when
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:56.760]  locals complain the local news says you're insane
[1:54:56.760 --> 1:55:00.600]  even as buildings are on fire they quietly lease buildings blow them up
[1:55:00.600 --> 1:55:03.560]  they're on fire and then when i went down to san
[1:55:03.560 --> 1:55:06.760]  antonio because even though the police chief said no they still did it
[1:55:06.760 --> 1:55:09.720]  and i and this was in world that daily they're the only ones to pick it up
[1:55:09.720 --> 1:55:13.640]  they called the army and they admitted it they came up and and and mike hanson
[1:55:13.640 --> 1:55:16.120]  was videoing with me and mike wouldn't put his camera down
[1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:19.480]  the guy pulled out his 45 stuck it to mike's chest and said
[1:55:19.480 --> 1:55:23.480]  give me that camera and they took the tape away from mike
[1:55:23.480 --> 1:55:26.920]  i mean i mean i've had the army with 45s out
[1:55:26.920 --> 1:55:30.600]  i mean this is what america is
[1:55:32.360 --> 1:55:36.040]  anything else let's keep your your passion yes
[1:55:36.040 --> 1:55:39.560]  i think we're missing a bit with uh with this
[1:55:39.560 --> 1:55:44.920]  eugenics all of the the famous actors that have the children that are either
[1:55:44.920 --> 1:55:48.280]  have autism or have down syndrome or all of the
[1:55:48.280 --> 1:55:52.280]  they realize is they're focusing on just the old people they're going to go
[1:55:52.280 --> 1:55:57.320]  through with every child that is not quite right and take them out they're
[1:55:57.320 --> 1:56:01.320]  going to get the children children's hospitals the asylum
[1:56:01.320 --> 1:56:06.200]  the next will be our military hospital you're right but that's only classical
[1:56:06.200 --> 1:56:12.760]  eugenics created by gallton uh in 1843
[1:56:12.760 --> 1:56:16.920]  that's the public eugenics is we're going to get rid of the retarded
[1:56:16.920 --> 1:56:21.160]  get rid of the old get rid of the ugly get rid of all these groups
[1:56:21.160 --> 1:56:25.320]  and then we're going to build a super race hitler picked up on that mine comp he
[1:56:25.320 --> 1:56:28.440]  thinks margaret sanger other us eugenicist groups he
[1:56:28.440 --> 1:56:33.000]  thinks that's only one system the real system of eugenics
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:37.160]  is actually targeting the strong and healthy that aren't part of the elite
[1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:40.280]  that's why they poison the water and the food
[1:56:40.280 --> 1:56:43.880]  exactly because they're they're creating the feast them in the serfdom
[1:56:43.880 --> 1:56:48.120]  and those serfdoms that don't live out to to be the potential that they want
[1:56:48.120 --> 1:56:51.640]  them to be are expendable good good point ma'am
[1:56:51.640 --> 1:56:54.280]  good point and in closing here and i'm sorry i can't go to other calls
