[00:00.000 --> 00:14.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Sunday evening broadcast.
[00:14.040 --> 00:18.320]  I am here in beautiful, and I mean beautiful New York City.
[00:18.320 --> 00:20.160]  The weather here is incredible.
[00:20.160 --> 00:21.840]  Central Park is amazing.
[00:21.840 --> 00:25.720]  You forget how much the globalists have run one of the greatest cities in the world into
[00:25.720 --> 00:27.220]  the ground.
[00:27.220 --> 00:30.680]  And I've got a lot of news to cover today here with Owen Schroyer, a lot of exclusive
[00:30.680 --> 00:31.680]  intel.
[00:31.680 --> 00:33.080]  Let me give you the really good news.
[00:33.080 --> 00:41.760]  I walked all six miles around Central Park this morning, and I was being very low-key
[00:41.760 --> 00:45.240]  wearing sunglasses and a ball cap.
[00:45.240 --> 00:51.120]  And I then walked another mile and a half to a restaurant where I had late breakfast
[00:51.120 --> 00:54.680]  and then I walked back to my hotel where I'm staying obviously because I tried to shun
[00:54.680 --> 00:55.680]  and destroy Trump.
[00:55.680 --> 01:00.760]  So there's no secret where I'm staying here at Trump Tower in New York.
[01:00.760 --> 01:04.360]  You can see right out the window, Central Park.
[01:04.360 --> 01:10.280]  And I got mobbed, absolutely mobbed by black people, by white people, by Hispanic people,
[01:10.280 --> 01:11.280]  by gay dudes.
[01:11.280 --> 01:16.360]  I mean, it was just a totally diverse population of people.
[01:16.360 --> 01:20.280]  Every restaurant I went into, because I wanted to want to see the bathroom, I went a little
[01:20.280 --> 01:25.440]  rock shop to buy my children a few little rocks or whatever, and the guy that owned
[01:25.440 --> 01:26.440]  it was a listener.
[01:26.440 --> 01:33.640]  I mean, just simply amazing to get on the ground understanding of how many people are
[01:33.640 --> 01:34.640]  awake.
[01:34.640 --> 01:38.680]  Just remember that when you're not prominent, when you're not on air, which is a positive
[01:38.680 --> 01:42.160]  thing, by the way, I'm not saying, oh, I'm on air, you're not, I'm saying, I am like
[01:42.160 --> 01:45.880]  a gauge or an indicator.
[01:45.880 --> 01:52.880]  I like to watch the temperature in the engine, just like a temperature gauge, or a wind gauge
[01:52.880 --> 01:54.720]  on top of a barn.
[01:54.720 --> 01:58.720]  And I can tell you that I've been coming to New York my whole life, always like visiting
[01:58.720 --> 01:59.720]  New York, back when I was a kid.
[01:59.720 --> 02:04.520]  My parents take me here to see the famous museums in Central Park and things like that.
[02:04.520 --> 02:09.440]  And I've been on air 27 years, and I've never been mobbed like I've been in New York.
[02:09.440 --> 02:13.320]  Extremely positive, nothing negative, not even hateful looks.
[02:13.320 --> 02:16.000]  It's just been absolutely crazy.
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.080]  And again, last night and today, I've gone to trendy restaurants, places where it's
[02:19.080 --> 02:22.480]  a bunch of blue-haired liberals, and they're all listeners.
[02:22.480 --> 02:26.160]  So a lot of really good, positive feedback, oh, and I know you've got tons of news to
[02:26.160 --> 02:30.960]  cover today, and we've got massive false-flag news, we've got Google, as I already told
[02:30.960 --> 02:34.640]  you, Google, is heavily involved with Blue On Lab.
[02:34.640 --> 02:45.120]  Also is Facebook, Facebook, Google, and Apple are all larger position owners in Big Tech
[02:45.120 --> 02:48.560]  than even somebody like Bill Gates is, and Gates owns a piece of basically everything
[02:48.560 --> 02:49.560]  as well.
[02:49.560 --> 02:50.560]  He owns a piece of Facebook.
[02:50.560 --> 02:54.040]  But when you understand that Big Tech is the new government, it's the technocracy, it's
[02:54.040 --> 02:58.960]  the controlling system, big article by Jamie White on infowars.com, from his treasure trove
[02:58.960 --> 03:05.400]  of Peter Dasek emails that ran the Wuhan data function operation that Google 2017 was one
[03:05.400 --> 03:10.000]  of the main funders of taking these viruses out of the wild and weaponizing them.
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.080]  So no wonder they censor you when you say it came out of the lab.
[03:14.080 --> 03:15.280]  So we've got that incredible news.
[03:15.280 --> 03:19.240]  I went over to Epstein's Torture Palace, and we've got even more on that coming out.
[03:19.240 --> 03:21.480]  Oh, and tell folks what you've got coming up today.
[03:21.480 --> 03:27.680]  Well, everybody knows Joe Biden is obviously not all the way there, and now a White House
[03:27.680 --> 03:33.120]  physician who worked with Obama and Trump, Ronnie Jackson, has come out and said that
[03:33.120 --> 03:36.280]  it's time for Biden to take a cognition test.
[03:36.280 --> 03:41.000]  And of course, he uses the media against themselves saying, hey, you called for Trump to do it.
[03:41.000 --> 03:42.000]  You made Trump do it.
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.000]  He did it.
[03:43.000 --> 03:44.000]  You said all these things about Trump.
[03:44.000 --> 03:45.000]  He took it.
[03:45.000 --> 03:46.000]  He passed.
[03:46.000 --> 03:47.000]  Let's see Biden do the same thing.
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.880]  So, I mean, middle of the road, people that just care about this country and don't want
[03:49.880 --> 03:55.320]  to see it fall, Alex, are looking at the complete disaster that is the Biden administration.
[03:55.320 --> 03:59.760]  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is the vice president, and they're just like, look, I don't want America
[03:59.760 --> 04:00.760]  to go down like this.
[04:00.760 --> 04:03.760]  They may not even understand how bad it really is, but they see that, and they're saying,
[04:03.760 --> 04:05.000]  this is embarrassing.
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.000]  We just had the G7.
[04:06.000 --> 04:07.200]  We had the Putin summit.
[04:07.200 --> 04:08.920]  And what did Biden get out of any of it?
[04:08.920 --> 04:09.920]  Nothing.
[04:09.920 --> 04:10.920]  Our energy's been cut off.
[04:10.920 --> 04:12.080]  Russia gets pipelines.
[04:12.080 --> 04:13.080]  The U.S. doesn't.
[04:13.080 --> 04:18.560]  And let's be clear, when you watch Biden on these videos, it's not like we're picking
[04:18.560 --> 04:20.040]  a gaffe or a gaffe there.
[04:20.040 --> 04:21.040]  It's all horrible.
[04:21.040 --> 04:22.280]  It's all embarrassing.
[04:22.280 --> 04:26.240]  He acts like people that are very old at a nursing home.
[04:26.240 --> 04:29.280]  On a scale of 1 to 10, some folks are there because they had a stroke, but they're all
[04:29.280 --> 04:30.280]  there mentally.
[04:30.280 --> 04:32.520]  And some people are there because they have really bad heart attack or they're partially
[04:32.520 --> 04:33.840]  paralyzed or their brain's there.
[04:33.840 --> 04:37.120]  Then there's a lot of folks at the nursing home who don't know really who they are.
[04:37.120 --> 04:39.720]  Biden on a scale of 1 to 10 is about a 7.
[04:39.720 --> 04:41.720]  And of course, a 10 is a vegetable.
[04:41.720 --> 04:46.760]  So, we'll break it all down with Owen Stroyer, big broadcast on this Sunday evening.
[04:46.760 --> 04:50.800]  I'm asking all the listeners and viewers, tell folks, tune in now.
[04:50.800 --> 04:52.360]  Info Wars is live.
[04:52.360 --> 04:54.040]  That's how he circumvents the censors.
[04:54.040 --> 05:14.000]  Info Wars is live now.
[05:14.000 --> 05:23.080]  In the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[05:23.080 --> 05:28.520]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this live Sunday
[05:28.520 --> 05:29.720]  Worldwide Broadcast.
[05:29.720 --> 05:31.880]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[05:31.880 --> 05:37.720]  It is 620, 21, the 20th day already.
[05:37.720 --> 05:42.800]  And I am very blessed and honored to have you here with us this evening.
[05:42.800 --> 05:49.680]  I'm coming to you from Trump Tower overlooking Central Park this evening.
[05:49.680 --> 05:53.240]  And I can tell you, New York is massively awake.
[05:53.240 --> 05:58.640]  I've talked to a lot of police, firefighters, but I've also talked just to the general public.
[05:58.640 --> 06:06.520]  And they are seeing through the propaganda massively unless they are single women.
[06:06.520 --> 06:10.480]  They tend to still be under the brainwashing and think they're in great danger from the
[06:10.480 --> 06:15.640]  overdriven, a hyped up COVID situation that they are playing to bring back.
[06:15.640 --> 06:20.040]  By the way, it's why it's important to keep exposing it, keep discrediting Klaus Schwab
[06:20.040 --> 06:23.000]  and Bill Gates, or they're going to bring this back again later.
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.120]  They like to launch an attack.
[06:25.120 --> 06:29.760]  Once opposition mounts, they kind of pull back for a while and then clamp down again later
[06:29.760 --> 06:33.960]  that every time we build enough opposition to throw them off, they will then release
[06:33.960 --> 06:36.640]  partially, only clamp down again later.
[06:36.640 --> 06:41.080]  That's the basic psychology of the enemy, if you understand that, you understand everything.
[06:41.080 --> 06:44.120]  I'm just going to be here for 30 minutes or so.
[06:44.120 --> 06:48.320]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, we're going to premiere here on radio slash TV,
[06:48.320 --> 06:54.000]  my visit to the seven-story torture dungeon, the pedophile dungeon of Jeffrey Epstein,
[06:54.000 --> 07:01.880]  the Mossad slash MI6 slash CIA, procure of children to the globalist are the larger
[07:01.880 --> 07:08.440]  blackmail rings directly tied to Bill Gates and Prince Andrew and many, many others.
[07:08.440 --> 07:13.280]  That is coming up at the bottom of the hour and then of course Owen is going to be getting
[07:13.280 --> 07:22.000]  into a former bipartisan doctor to Obama and to Trump, the White House physician coming
[07:22.000 --> 07:27.960]  out saying that Biden needs to take a cognitive test right now and because he clearly doesn't
[07:27.960 --> 07:29.200]  know what planet he's on.
[07:29.200 --> 07:32.320]  That was always part of the plan to get rid of him via the 25th amendment, but it's happening
[07:32.320 --> 07:36.520]  a little bit quicker than the deep state had hoped for.
[07:36.520 --> 07:41.160]  They wanted it, I think, closer to the midterms, but that is falling apart right now in front
[07:41.160 --> 07:42.160]  of the world.
[07:42.160 --> 07:49.920]  But first, the big issue, there's two of them and they, like a binary star system, they
[07:49.920 --> 07:50.920]  orbit each other.
[07:50.920 --> 07:56.880]  You have the great false flag of the COVID-19 and the lockdown and the global starvation
[07:56.880 --> 08:02.040]  that triggered and the fact that it's now, it's come out, it's on enforce.com, it needs
[08:02.040 --> 08:08.240]  to go super viral, the direct Peter Dazik emails via another foyer request.
[08:08.240 --> 08:13.800]  We now know why Google, Twitter and Facebook are criminally blocking that and trying to
[08:13.800 --> 08:17.720]  suspend any organization or group that legally gets these and puts them out.
[08:17.720 --> 08:25.080]  Peter Dazik, ladies and gentlemen, on record, his number two funder was Google and it wasn't
[08:25.080 --> 08:29.520]  just some varied area of virology, Dazik was studying dozens of areas.
[08:29.520 --> 08:37.640]  It was specifically gain a function of weaponized zoological viruses out of wet markets and
[08:37.640 --> 08:42.160]  out of the jungles and caves of China and other parts of the world, bringing them all
[08:42.160 --> 08:48.560]  to Wuhan and then preparing the cover story that was going to come out of a wet market
[08:48.560 --> 08:50.520]  that's even in the documents.
[08:50.520 --> 08:54.760]  That's why you saw Fauci four years ago saying Trump will be challenged by a major pandemic
[08:54.760 --> 08:57.200]  right before his first term is out.
[08:57.200 --> 09:02.520]  They scripted and battle planned and prepared this entire criminal operation.
[09:02.520 --> 09:07.440]  Remember, not just saying that now, I've been saying since it started, Big Tech is heavily
[09:07.440 --> 09:08.440]  involved.
[09:08.440 --> 09:11.720]  If you study Google and Facebook, I don't know which one's more involved because they're
[09:11.720 --> 09:18.760]  both so involved, billions of dollars in nanotech, billions of dollars in genetic engineering
[09:18.760 --> 09:19.760]  every year.
[09:19.760 --> 09:21.560]  I mean, they are buying up everything.
[09:21.560 --> 09:22.560]  They're not just Big Tech.
[09:22.560 --> 09:23.560]  They're not just advertising.
[09:23.560 --> 09:25.240]  They're not just surveillance.
[09:25.240 --> 09:29.560]  They are buying up everything and they're obsessed with Big Pharma because if you're
[09:29.560 --> 09:32.960]  information control, you can suppress consumer reports.
[09:32.960 --> 09:37.320]  You can suppress medical doctors, scientists, members of Congress, U.S. senators, governors
[09:37.320 --> 09:38.720]  having hearings.
[09:38.720 --> 09:43.840]  If you can suppress off-the-shelf cheap drugs that are 100% cure for things like ivermectin
[09:43.840 --> 09:49.120]  and hydroxychloroquine and rendezivir and other things, if you can successfully suppress
[09:49.120 --> 09:54.480]  all that, well, then you can push your poises on people and make trillions, but also get
[09:54.480 --> 09:55.480]  full control.
[09:55.480 --> 09:59.360]  You can also suppress the deaths and the rest of it.
[09:59.360 --> 10:05.600]  You can talk about antitrust legislation, getting rid of section 230 that gives them
[10:05.600 --> 10:08.280]  immunity and all the rest of it, but it's the racketeering.
[10:08.280 --> 10:09.280]  It's the organized crime.
[10:09.280 --> 10:13.720]  It's them being invested in Big Pharma and then censoring congressional hearings about
[10:13.720 --> 10:15.400]  corruption in Big Pharma.
[10:15.400 --> 10:16.960]  This is just unbelievable.
[10:16.960 --> 10:18.840]  This is next level racketeering.
[10:18.840 --> 10:20.520]  We're going to be covering that.
[10:20.520 --> 10:24.720]  But the first other big issue I wanted to hit, as I said, this is a binary issue.
[10:24.720 --> 10:29.600]  Two big issues that are the same issue that orbit each other, that are identical twins,
[10:29.600 --> 10:33.240]  and that is the false flag of January 6.
[10:33.240 --> 10:35.600]  Do they provocateurs and people into going in?
[10:35.600 --> 10:36.600]  Absolutely.
[10:36.600 --> 10:42.080]  But the impetus, the police stand down, the infiltration of legitimate groups, good groups
[10:42.080 --> 10:48.400]  with good founders and good leaders, like Stuart Rhodes and the Oathkeepers, great organization,
[10:48.400 --> 10:52.120]  great long history until that day, it was so big, they had so many people there, they
[10:52.120 --> 10:59.280]  were able to infiltrate it, along with Antifa and along with the Proud Boys, to get in there
[10:59.280 --> 11:03.440]  and to basically have some actual real patriots who thought they were under Q's command going
[11:03.440 --> 11:06.200]  into the building.
[11:06.200 --> 11:11.160]  But now, as you notice, Tucker Carlson with the revolver story last Monday and then beating
[11:11.160 --> 11:15.920]  the drum the last five days, first just put out the question, let them attack you and
[11:15.920 --> 11:16.920]  say it was preposterous.
[11:16.920 --> 11:21.800]  Now he's bringing out dozens of examples of the FBI setting people up, staging terror
[11:21.800 --> 11:26.840]  attacks, other false flags, and then knowing the names of the informants and of the FBI
[11:26.840 --> 11:32.200]  agents are actually already known and have already come out and are known to us as well.
[11:32.200 --> 11:37.480]  And so I would look for some time, end of next week for that to be beginning to be released.
[11:37.480 --> 11:41.560]  We'd like to give you next week's news today, as you all know.
[11:41.560 --> 11:44.720]  I didn't give Tucker Carlson all this information, I didn't tell him what to do.
[11:44.720 --> 11:49.200]  I sat back as this was being teed up because I know the people involved with revolver and
[11:49.200 --> 11:50.200]  others.
[11:50.200 --> 11:52.400]  I helped contribute some, it's true.
[11:52.400 --> 11:56.040]  And then I just said, I think it'll be better for revolver, and that's what they did in
[11:56.040 --> 11:58.280]  my own mind if I could have pushed it revolver on.
[11:58.280 --> 12:02.400]  I thought, I think Tucker will do a better job teeing this up because they'll take the
[12:02.400 --> 12:07.080]  bait from him to really go after him just like the Wuhan lab we told you a year and
[12:07.080 --> 12:12.160]  a half ago and Tucker told you six months ago that that was an inside job.
[12:12.160 --> 12:14.080]  Now the question isn't, did it come out of the lab?
[12:14.080 --> 12:16.160]  The question is, did they do it on purpose?
[12:16.160 --> 12:19.120]  So this is all coming up.
[12:19.120 --> 12:20.640]  You've got Maxine Waters panicking.
[12:20.640 --> 12:22.880]  You've got all these former FBI agents everywhere panning.
[12:22.880 --> 12:25.120]  We've got Frank Figliuzzi back on TV.
[12:25.120 --> 12:28.800]  I think I forgot to send you guys this clip, but he was on MSNBC again saying we're going
[12:28.800 --> 12:30.680]  to go after members of Congress.
[12:30.680 --> 12:33.040]  He says we're going to attack members of Congress.
[12:33.040 --> 12:34.520]  So he says, I need to be arrested.
[12:34.520 --> 12:39.360]  We only be arrested for the operation that the FBI hyped up and manipulated a bunch of
[12:39.360 --> 12:40.360]  anger.
[12:40.360 --> 12:44.480]  But there were some real people that went in, so it was more of a provocateur action.
[12:44.480 --> 12:49.760]  It was a false flag atmosphere they created to allow it to happen, but not a pure complete
[12:49.760 --> 12:55.760]  false flag, more of a leave the hot grease on the stove with the flame on.
[12:55.760 --> 13:00.040]  And you can kind of say, well, did we burn down the house or was there an accident?
[13:00.040 --> 13:05.160]  But clearly, totally staged at the top with the environment that they set up.
[13:05.160 --> 13:09.000]  We're going to be walking through all of that when we come back and the fact that that's
[13:09.000 --> 13:15.760]  about to come out and then like Chinese water torture, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip.
[13:15.760 --> 13:19.440]  You're going to hear about Fast and Furious and why Eric Holder had to step down, hundreds
[13:19.440 --> 13:26.080]  of thousands of guns knowingly shipped into Mexico to then be shipped to the Jihad fighters.
[13:26.080 --> 13:29.320]  We're going to be bringing out all the other, the original World Trade Center bombing.
[13:29.320 --> 13:31.760]  We're going to be bringing out Oklahoma City.
[13:31.760 --> 13:36.760]  You're going to be seeing all these big cases of stage false flag run by the ATF, run by
[13:36.760 --> 13:37.760]  the FBI.
[13:37.760 --> 13:42.120]  And by the way, it was FBI agents that helped expose that Oklahoma City had been an inside
[13:42.120 --> 13:46.560]  job with the CIA, German intelligence and ATF.
[13:46.560 --> 13:50.600]  I was actually, the FBI was involved at the highest levels, but there was good FBI agents
[13:50.600 --> 13:56.840]  who actually leaked the video of the second bomb going off inside the building.
[13:56.840 --> 13:59.560]  And then all that footage got seized again with the LA Times reported on it.
[13:59.560 --> 14:04.680]  So when I'm up here, attacking the FBI, let's not just single the FBI out, the leadership,
[14:04.680 --> 14:09.800]  all these agencies at the top, working with big tech to censor the information, working
[14:09.800 --> 14:11.560]  with big corporations to suppress the people.
[14:11.560 --> 14:15.440]  And that's that corporate global fascist alliance that's establishing the World ID,
[14:15.440 --> 14:17.800]  the World Social Credit Score, allied with China.
[14:17.800 --> 14:23.360]  And once America and the world awakens to that, we use the constitutional role of government
[14:23.360 --> 14:27.960]  and of our free speech, and of our political action, and of our lawsuits, and of our protests
[14:27.960 --> 14:33.320]  to say, no, we're going to remove this out of control corrupt cabal that is firmly entrenched.
[14:33.320 --> 14:36.800]  But you notice things I talked about 20 years ago, nobody understood it.
[14:36.800 --> 14:41.560]  Now what we talk about is mainline understanding as the public is educated and informed, and
[14:41.560 --> 14:44.880]  we're going from crawling to walking to running to jumping to flying.
[14:44.880 --> 14:49.040]  And so the acceleration of growth curve, the understanding of this is magnificent.
[14:49.040 --> 14:52.600]  We'll be back with the Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show hosted with Owen Schreuer.
[14:52.600 --> 14:55.320]  I'll be here a little bit longer than Owen is going to take over.
[14:55.320 --> 14:56.320]  Stay with us.
[14:56.320 --> 14:57.320]  We'll be right back.
[14:57.320 --> 15:03.560]  Again, I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person, but because of the globalists
[15:03.560 --> 15:08.280]  and their attack on humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure.
[15:08.280 --> 15:12.320]  And we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[15:12.320 --> 15:15.760]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me
[15:15.760 --> 15:16.760]  a break.
[15:16.760 --> 15:17.760]  The Satanism's out in the open.
[15:17.760 --> 15:18.760]  I've always been a Christian.
[15:18.760 --> 15:22.760]  But now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear.
[15:22.760 --> 15:23.760]  And I get it.
[15:23.760 --> 15:24.760]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches.
[15:24.760 --> 15:29.040]  A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt priest class system.
[15:29.040 --> 15:30.040]  And I get it.
[15:30.040 --> 15:31.040]  Me too.
[15:31.040 --> 15:32.040]  Believe me, I'm one of them.
[15:32.040 --> 15:37.680]  But it's that relationship with God and just God's universe that God created that is so
[15:37.680 --> 15:38.680]  essential.
[15:38.680 --> 15:43.440]  And God created the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life.
[15:43.440 --> 15:45.280]  And so that's what M4 Wars is really all about.
[15:45.280 --> 15:46.840]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.
[15:46.840 --> 15:48.760]  Thank you for spreading the word about M4 Wars.
[15:48.760 --> 15:53.200]  And thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting M4WarsTour.com because
[15:53.200 --> 15:56.520]  without your daily and weekly and monthly purchases, we'll be taken off the air.
[15:56.520 --> 15:59.360]  So thank you for the support M4WarsTour.com.
[15:59.360 --> 16:03.920]  I started taking high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil more than a decade ago because the
[16:03.920 --> 16:05.920]  scientific literature is overwhelming.
[16:05.920 --> 16:09.480]  It's good for your heart, your brain, your whole body, your well-being.
[16:09.480 --> 16:12.320]  A lot of folks take it before they take test.
[16:12.320 --> 16:14.280]  People that have arthritis pain, they take it.
[16:14.280 --> 16:16.920]  It's well known for the things it does for a body.
[16:16.920 --> 16:18.920]  It makes our lives so much better.
[16:18.920 --> 16:23.360]  But then I learned about high-grade fish oil and high-grade krill oil.
[16:23.360 --> 16:27.520]  We've got both at M4WarsTour.com, but with the COVID lockdown, supply chains are broken
[16:27.520 --> 16:30.960]  down, so it's been months and months and months since we've had krill oil back at
[16:30.960 --> 16:31.960]  stock.
[16:31.960 --> 16:35.360]  But let's back, ladies and gentlemen, and despite the fact that it's already very fairly
[16:35.360 --> 16:40.720]  priced for the grade it is, highest quality, we're offering it at 40% off for a limited
[16:40.720 --> 16:46.120]  time at M4WarsTour.com with free shipping and double pay-through points because I want
[16:46.120 --> 16:48.600]  those of you that have already been customers to have a chance to get more of it.
[16:48.600 --> 16:52.840]  And I want new viewers and listeners who haven't tried it to get it from us and then try regular
[16:52.840 --> 16:56.240]  krill oil that is not one-tenth as powerful as ours.
[16:56.240 --> 17:00.240]  This is the highest grade back at stock at M4WarsTour.com.
[17:00.240 --> 17:04.160]  People pat me on the back all the time, and I really, really appreciate it, but I want
[17:04.160 --> 17:05.440]  you to understand something.
[17:05.440 --> 17:08.200]  Don't put the horse in front of the cart here.
[17:08.200 --> 17:11.880]  Don't put the wagon in front of the mules here.
[17:11.880 --> 17:15.560]  If you weren't supporting us, if you weren't praying for us, if you weren't spreading
[17:15.560 --> 17:20.120]  the word, we wouldn't be on air anymore, and we wouldn't have a shot at defeating the
[17:20.120 --> 17:22.160]  new world order like we have right now.
[17:22.160 --> 17:27.520]  So now more than ever, please visit M4WarsTour.com and get great products that make you and your

[17:36.680 --> 17:37.680]  to keep us on the air.
[17:37.680 --> 17:40.200]  We're going to defeat the globalists, but it's not going to happen easy.
[17:40.200 --> 17:41.200]  We need God on our side.

[19:02.920 --> 19:24.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[19:24.680 --> 19:27.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Sunday night, and that means we're live.
[19:27.600 --> 19:33.200]  We've been doing the Alex Jones Show for 14 years in the Sunday slot, 4 to 6 p.m. and
[19:33.200 --> 19:39.200]  of course the weekday slot, 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. we've been doing that for about 23, 24
[19:39.200 --> 19:40.200]  years.
[19:40.200 --> 19:45.800]  But on air for now over 27 years, and Owen Schreuer has already been with M4Wars, 4 and
[19:45.800 --> 19:49.720]  a half, almost, no, it's five years.
[19:49.720 --> 19:53.200]  Hard to believe, five years for Owen Schreuer.
[19:53.200 --> 19:58.920]  In fact, coming up in July, it'll be five years that he's been here, so congratulations
[19:58.920 --> 20:02.560]  to Owen Schreuer, and he of course hosts the War Room 3 to 6 p.m. weekdays, and his show
[20:02.560 --> 20:03.560]  is really growing.
[20:03.560 --> 20:07.520]  We're really proud of that, and very thankful to all viewers and listeners, 3 p.m. weekdays
[20:07.520 --> 20:11.800]  central, and then of course, Harrison Smith is also really doing a great job, 8 a.m. weekday
[20:11.800 --> 20:14.720]  mornings with American Journal.
[20:14.720 --> 20:20.600]  All times, everything posted at M4Wars.com, it's a revolutionary act to share this transmission.
[20:20.600 --> 20:24.640]  The media wants people to lie about me, take things out of contests, misrepresent what
[20:24.640 --> 20:26.040]  I say and what I do.
[20:26.040 --> 20:30.160]  They don't want people to actually hear what the man says, yours truly.
[20:30.160 --> 20:32.880]  So please continue to help save the country and the world.
[20:32.880 --> 20:36.640]  The enemy fears this broadcast because of the truth and our wide spectrum of understanding.
[20:36.640 --> 20:39.560]  So if you want to defeat the globalist, only you can prevent the new world order.
[20:39.560 --> 20:47.000]  And one of the best tools we've got, thanks to God, thanks for your support, is band.video.
[20:47.000 --> 20:50.480]  But Big Tech doesn't let you share that URL on their platform, so we have the backup URL
[20:50.480 --> 20:54.280]  that takes you to the same place, freeworldnews.tv, freeworldnews.tv.
[20:54.280 --> 20:59.800]  Okay, I want to play a few clips here and have Owen give his take and then take over
[20:59.800 --> 21:02.160]  after we hit this Jeffrey Epstein news.
[21:02.160 --> 21:03.160]  Next segment.
[21:03.160 --> 21:11.400]  GOP rep Fitzpatrick dismayed the right is disrespecting FBI with one six false flag claims.
[21:11.400 --> 21:17.720]  Since when are we not supposed to disrespect an agency that's protected Hillary Clinton,
[21:17.720 --> 21:22.040]  protected Hunter Biden, protected Jeffrey Epstein, we know, and protected the whole
[21:22.040 --> 21:23.040]  new world order?
[21:23.040 --> 21:27.120]  An agency that told us in the 50s, LaCosta Knowsford didn't exist because they reportedly
[21:27.120 --> 21:32.120]  had compromising information on the founder of the FBI.
[21:32.120 --> 21:36.360]  So when the FBI deserves credit, that's one of the best statistics systems in the world,
[21:36.360 --> 21:37.360]  I'll give it to them.
[21:37.360 --> 21:40.720]  And they came up with all that and Jagger Hoover did, he was a librarian.
[21:40.720 --> 21:45.960]  But man, come on, if somebody, you know, kidnapped your kid, the FBI tries to help unless they
[21:45.960 --> 21:48.800]  have been kidnapped by, you know, the insiders.
[21:48.800 --> 21:54.600]  But to say you can't criticize it or to say it's ridiculous, it's insane to say they
[21:54.600 --> 21:59.400]  might have had provocateurs inside the January 6th group.
[21:59.400 --> 22:02.720]  You know, Tucker and everybody could have just brought out all the proof right up front.
[22:02.720 --> 22:06.440]  But instead it's introduced and we show you the history of it, hundreds of cases of it,
[22:06.440 --> 22:10.120]  and then the information is going to be coming out.
[22:10.120 --> 22:12.240]  And that's just the best way to defeat the new world order.
[22:12.240 --> 22:13.240]  The best way to do it.
[22:13.240 --> 22:15.960]  We knew exactly what happened at Wuhan lab day one.
[22:15.960 --> 22:18.240]  We know exactly what the Globals are going to do to the border.
[22:18.240 --> 22:22.240]  We know exactly what Joe Biden is going to do because they are enemies of this country
[22:22.240 --> 22:26.360]  and they have a blueprint, they have an operation that they've launched against us.
[22:26.360 --> 22:29.680]  And then Fickly Uzi of the FBI is also on TV.
[22:29.680 --> 22:33.640]  Remember, he said two weeks ago, he said we need to understand that members of Congress
[22:33.640 --> 22:36.240]  are the ones running the radicalization.
[22:36.240 --> 22:40.080]  We do attack those congressmen with anti-terrorism tactics.
[22:40.080 --> 22:42.000]  Well, that means kill, basically.
[22:42.000 --> 22:45.600]  So they're the ones talking about killing members of Congress.
[22:45.600 --> 22:48.640]  When you understand the definitions that they're using, and this is the idea they're trying
[22:48.640 --> 22:51.640]  to introduce because this is a coup group coming in and taking the country over.
[22:51.640 --> 22:56.840]  But you've also got Republicans that fetishize the FBI, like this congressman out of Pennsylvania,
[22:56.840 --> 22:59.840]  who is a former FBI agent himself.
[22:59.840 --> 23:05.840]  So he's either super naive, dumb as a voxer ox, or he is actively covering this up.
[23:05.840 --> 23:11.040]  Because there were provocateurs on January 6th, CNN was involved with Jaden X, there
[23:11.040 --> 23:16.760]  was a consortium of leftist groups that were there trying to hype people into doing the
[23:16.760 --> 23:18.840]  wrong thing, an angry crowd.
[23:18.840 --> 23:20.520]  And so the fact is, they did that.
[23:20.520 --> 23:24.760]  And now they've got this new national terrorism report they've put out that Tucker Carlson,
[23:24.760 --> 23:31.480]  a great job on Friday night with Greenwald, laying out how it's the declaration of war
[23:31.480 --> 23:36.040]  against America, declaration of war against anybody who, quote, radicalizes someone, or
[23:36.040 --> 23:41.000]  anyone that's a racist, which they can define as anything, or here's the key.
[23:41.000 --> 23:46.120]  Anyone questioning COVID lockdowns or the origin of COVID-19, did you know that if you
[23:46.120 --> 23:51.280]  say it came from a lab, it says that you need to be frustrated and blocked by the national
[23:51.280 --> 23:56.800]  security apparatus, by our military, by the CIA, I mean this, that right there is a total
[23:56.800 --> 24:00.080]  indictment of the FBI and the Justice Department leadership.
[24:00.080 --> 24:02.520]  This is bald face out of control.
[24:02.520 --> 24:07.280]  So here's a congressman, Fitzpatrick out there carrying the FBI's water, the corrupt
[24:07.280 --> 24:12.000]  group at the top of the FBI totally discrediting it, because we need a federal arm of law enforcement
[24:12.000 --> 24:13.000]  in this country.
[24:13.000 --> 24:14.000]  That's a federal rule.
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.160]  We've always had federal lawmen.
[24:16.160 --> 24:18.760]  This is not what we've got at the FBI now.
[24:18.760 --> 24:22.560]  You've got a compartmentalized group of Ivy League leftists, CHICOM agents running this
[24:22.560 --> 24:26.480]  country in the ground, trying to criminalize their political opposition, and that is the
[24:26.480 --> 24:27.480]  clear and present danger.
[24:27.480 --> 24:28.480]  Here he is.
[24:28.480 --> 24:33.880]  Some of your fellow House Republicans are embracing a completely baseless conspiracy
[24:33.880 --> 24:39.080]  that the January 6th Capitol attack was actually a false flag operation carried out by the
[24:39.080 --> 24:40.080]  FBI.
[24:40.080 --> 24:44.280]  You're not only one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach former President Trump over
[24:44.280 --> 24:48.000]  the insurrection, you spent 14 years working for the FBI.
[24:48.000 --> 24:49.000]  What's your response?
[24:49.000 --> 24:57.600]  Well, Dana, I will tell you, being a lifelong FBI agent, I will tell you, you know, starting
[24:57.600 --> 25:01.320]  in New York, ending in LA and serving across the globe, when I got sworn into Congress
[25:01.320 --> 25:08.440]  in 2017, I've been very, very taken back and dismayed at the disrespect that law enforcement
[25:08.440 --> 25:13.360]  is being given across the board, both on the left and the right, quite frankly.
[25:13.360 --> 25:18.240]  On the left, with local police, and on the right with the FBI, in fact, just this week,
[25:18.240 --> 25:22.320]  the FBI got attacked twice, once from my Democrat colleagues on the Intel Committee on what
[25:22.320 --> 25:26.600]  I said, and then later by my colleagues on the right who were trying to come up with
[25:26.600 --> 25:32.200]  this theory that somehow the FBI was behind January 6th, which is incredibly irresponsible.
[25:32.200 --> 25:36.920]  And anybody that understands the criminal code, understands law enforcement, Dana, knows
[25:36.920 --> 25:41.680]  that a federal law enforcement agent cannot engage in a conspiracy, it wouldn't be a conspiracy
[25:41.680 --> 25:42.680]  in that case.
[25:42.680 --> 25:45.320]  If they're acting within the scope of their employment, and if they're acting outside
[25:45.320 --> 25:48.880]  of the scope of their employment, they wouldn't be an unindicted co-conspirator, they would
[25:48.880 --> 25:50.880]  be an indicted co-conspirator.
[25:50.880 --> 25:52.920]  So the facts don't even follow.
[25:52.920 --> 25:55.880]  And I think the rhetoric is very dangerous, and it's got to stop.
[25:55.880 --> 26:02.160]  Okay, can I spend 10 hours here about the FBI illegally spying on Trump and his campaign
[26:02.160 --> 26:04.320]  in line to Congress about it?
[26:04.320 --> 26:07.640]  Or the fake FISA warrants, they went and lied to the court 20-something times.
[26:07.640 --> 26:13.240]  I mean, should I go on for 50 hours here about Fast and Furious and the ATF and the FBI covering
[26:13.240 --> 26:16.080]  it up, hundreds of thousands of weapons, tens of thousands killed?
[26:16.080 --> 26:22.680]  I mean, this is ridiculous, ladies and gentlemen, to sit there and say, oh, it's disrespect
[26:22.680 --> 26:26.360]  to even question an event like this, like where were the police?
[26:26.360 --> 26:27.640]  Trump asked for the National Guard out there.
[26:27.640 --> 26:30.600]  We should have had 10,000 groups, just for crowd control and everything else, because
[26:30.600 --> 26:34.680]  a big crowd, to get out of control, it doesn't matter who it is, it's so easy to manipulate
[26:34.680 --> 26:35.680]  somebody like that.
[26:35.680 --> 26:36.680]  And we know that happened.
[26:36.680 --> 26:38.200]  And I've been honest about what happened.
[26:38.200 --> 26:41.480]  There were some patriots that got suckered into this, and were part of it, and it was
[26:41.480 --> 26:42.480]  wrong.
[26:42.480 --> 26:46.960]  But it wasn't the greatest attack in U.S. history, it's not a reason to criminalize all opposition
[26:46.960 --> 26:49.520]  of the new world order takeover that's taking place right now.
[26:49.520 --> 26:51.960]  How long have we got to break here?
[26:51.960 --> 26:56.920]  We're going to go back to break, we're going to come back with Fickly Uzi, who again, these
[26:56.920 --> 26:57.920]  are spokespersons.
[26:57.920 --> 27:03.880]  When Fickly Uzi gets up there and he says, what do I think of what Tucker Carlson's been
[27:03.880 --> 27:04.880]  doing?
[27:04.880 --> 27:09.360]  I think Congress is directing this claim that the FBI is involved because they know they're
[27:09.360 --> 27:10.360]  about to get arrested.
[27:10.360 --> 27:15.240]  So at least he's not saying we need to attack Congress as a terror network for their speech
[27:15.240 --> 27:16.640]  like he did two weeks ago.
[27:16.640 --> 27:20.840]  But he's still up there with that sick smile, wouldn't buy a car from him, wouldn't let
[27:20.840 --> 27:26.640]  him babysit my kids, but forget how he looks, he's a piece of garbage, a real fascist, a
[27:26.640 --> 27:28.400]  real danger to this country.
[27:28.400 --> 27:31.520]  And he's just sitting there, he goes right back to Congress and says, oh, we need to
[27:31.520 --> 27:32.520]  get Congress.
[27:32.520 --> 27:36.720]  So I'm not saying get Congress, I'm not saying storm buildings, I'm not saying arrest people,
[27:36.720 --> 27:37.720]  he's saying that.
[27:37.720 --> 27:41.960]  It's the left burning down this country and attacking all of our real institutions so
[27:41.960 --> 27:44.800]  the feds that they control could come in and take them over.
[27:44.800 --> 27:47.800]  That's what all this top hate is about, everybody sees through it.
[27:47.800 --> 27:51.320]  The FBI is a captured institution, it's a captured agency.
[27:51.320 --> 27:54.680]  Let's take it back legally and lawfully before it starts a giant civil war.
[27:54.680 --> 27:55.680]  We'll be right back.
[27:55.680 --> 27:59.360]  I'm Alex Jones, the one destroyer.
[27:59.360 --> 28:02.800]  All the evil men in power seem to flourish as the good men do nothing.
[28:02.800 --> 28:07.560]  Well, I'm trying to be a good man, I'm trying to stand up to the right thing, and I've seen
[28:07.560 --> 28:12.560]  huge effects with what we've done here at InfoWars, other good men and women getting
[28:12.560 --> 28:16.320]  together and telling the truth and standing up to corruption.

[32:23.320 --> 32:26.680]  Our instructor is about to take over here in a moment.

[33:06.160 --> 33:11.920]  and data that has the entire global system shaken to its very, very core.
[33:11.920 --> 33:17.360]  And thanks to the blessings of God and the enemies attacking us so much, we've trended
[33:17.360 --> 33:25.520]  in the top five again on Facebook and on YouTube and on Twitter again in the last few days.
[33:25.520 --> 33:31.160]  And so no weapon formed against us shall prosper as long as that's God's plan.
[33:31.160 --> 33:35.800]  But Owen Troyer, I want to play this clip of Fickly Eusey, the newest clip of him saying,
[33:35.800 --> 33:40.600]  oh, the Congress is the one saying the FBI might have provocative, because the FBI is
[33:40.600 --> 33:42.160]  going to arrest them.
[33:42.160 --> 33:48.160]  I mean, just insane to watch this congressman, Fitzpatrick, so-called Republicans say the
[33:48.160 --> 33:49.600]  FBI has never done anything wrong.
[33:49.600 --> 33:51.440]  Really, what about the FBI and Whitey Bulger?
[33:51.440 --> 33:57.460]  I mean, I consider it for 50 hours and just rattle off where the FBI got caught murder
[33:57.460 --> 34:01.320]  for hire or the FBI got caught involved in money laundering.
[34:01.320 --> 34:06.080]  I mean, a lot of corrupt people get into the government with government power so they can
[34:06.080 --> 34:07.080]  do bad things.
[34:07.080 --> 34:12.840]  But now what we have is the Democrats, since the Clintons control the FBI, and they run
[34:12.840 --> 34:17.240]  every type of crime and evil operation you could imagine, and Eric Holder had to step
[34:17.240 --> 34:21.440]  down over Fast and Furious because he were caught red-handed, but nobody got in trouble.
[34:21.440 --> 34:25.640]  And so the idea that the same FBI and the same Loretta Lynch that protected the Clintons
[34:25.640 --> 34:30.080]  and all this says, how dare you disrespect us and say we might have had informants of
[34:30.080 --> 34:34.360]  provocateurs inside those groups when we already know they have them inside of there.
[34:34.360 --> 34:38.440]  Just come out that the Bucks of the leadership were federal informants, Owen.
[34:38.440 --> 34:42.200]  Well, let's not forget that Comey perjured himself multiple times.
[34:42.200 --> 34:44.960]  He talks about how he liked to leak things.
[34:44.960 --> 34:50.480]  He basically told how FBI leadership leaks things out there to friends or media or professors
[34:50.480 --> 34:51.480]  or whatever.
[34:51.480 --> 34:52.480]  Of course, he testified they didn't.
[34:52.480 --> 34:53.480]  Then he bragged he did.
[34:53.480 --> 34:56.760]  Just like Ron Rosenstein testified that he didn't say he was going to wear a wire when
[34:56.760 --> 34:57.760]  he did.
[34:57.760 --> 34:58.760]  But yeah, exactly.
[34:58.760 --> 35:00.280]  These people are lying lawyers, man.
[35:00.280 --> 35:03.720]  They're the most corrupt lawyers in America, probably the world.
[35:03.720 --> 35:09.760]  Joe Biden brags on TV about how, oh, I said fire them prosecutor and son of a bitch, he
[35:09.760 --> 35:10.760]  was fired.
[35:10.760 --> 35:13.480]  I mean, these people brag on TV about their criminal activity.
[35:13.480 --> 35:15.600]  Where is the FBI?
[35:15.600 --> 35:20.600]  And let's not forget that Donald Trump, President Donald Trump, declassified the JFK papers,
[35:20.600 --> 35:24.920]  which were being kept secret for so long that came out and said the FBI lied about the assassination
[35:24.920 --> 35:27.720]  of JFK and had agents on TV.
[35:27.720 --> 35:30.400]  And I find it hilarious that that individual goes on TV.
[35:30.400 --> 35:35.000]  And of course, you know, he tells you, hey, yeah, I was former FBI, New York, LA, oh,
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.160]  now he's in Pennsylvania, maybe he's in the Happy Valley area.
[35:38.160 --> 35:39.160]  Maybe we can look into that.
[35:39.160 --> 35:40.160]  Maybe there's a connection there.
[35:40.160 --> 35:41.720]  But so yeah, he's covering up.
[35:41.720 --> 35:44.000]  He goes on CNN, of course.
[35:44.000 --> 35:49.520]  He goes on CNN, declares, oh, I'm an FBI agent, and I say, no, the FBI does nothing wrong.
[35:49.520 --> 35:51.000]  Never anything, never has.
[35:51.000 --> 35:54.840]  But the rank and file Alex that would tune into this broadcast knows about the corruption
[35:54.840 --> 35:55.840]  at the top.
[35:55.840 --> 35:56.920]  They're some of the most awakened listeners.
[35:56.920 --> 35:58.480]  They'll even call in and tell you.
[35:58.480 --> 36:00.320]  Well, exactly.
[36:00.320 --> 36:04.320]  And I've had FBI agents on the show, retired and current, well, they've given us a lot
[36:04.320 --> 36:05.320]  of good info.
[36:05.320 --> 36:08.960]  There are good men and women in all these groups, but to deny what's happening at the top is
[36:08.960 --> 36:09.960]  a fraud.
[36:09.960 --> 36:11.960]  So let's go to this next clip.
[36:11.960 --> 36:12.960]  Set the stage.
[36:12.960 --> 36:16.600]  You've got Brian Williams that says he was shot down in a helicopter when they weren't
[36:16.600 --> 36:20.640]  even shot at, who's now the fact checker in NBC.
[36:20.640 --> 36:28.440]  And here they are on NBC News with Figliuzzi, who is this former deputy assistant director
[36:28.440 --> 36:34.120]  of the FBI, who is carrying the propaganda two weeks ago to, quote, attack Congress because
[36:34.120 --> 36:36.760]  they're terror leaders off their words.
[36:36.760 --> 36:40.360]  Not not, oh, they call for violence so they get in trouble, like the Democrats are doing.
[36:40.360 --> 36:42.520]  No, no, they're challenging the election.
[36:42.520 --> 36:44.080]  They're challenging the lockdown.
[36:44.080 --> 36:48.680]  That's in the new official directive of the president to all the intelligence agencies
[36:48.680 --> 36:53.600]  in the FBI to stop people that question lockdowns and stop people that believe in traditional
[36:53.600 --> 36:56.240]  families and stop people that question the election.
[36:56.240 --> 36:57.760]  It's in the damn report.
[36:57.760 --> 36:59.200]  We covered it three days ago.
[36:59.200 --> 37:01.080]  Tucker covered it a Friday night.
[37:01.080 --> 37:02.080]  You ought to air it next time.
[37:02.080 --> 37:03.080]  You've got time.
[37:03.080 --> 37:04.080]  It's so insane.
[37:04.080 --> 37:05.080]  But here's here.
[37:05.080 --> 37:08.440]  Here's Figliuzzi countering quote, Tucker Carlson, not challenging anything.
[37:08.440 --> 37:15.680]  He said going, oh, Congress is directing this saying it's us because they know we're coming
[37:15.680 --> 37:21.360]  to get them that that circular logic of him up there saying this is insane.
[37:21.360 --> 37:27.440]  It's because by that yardstick, the Democrats call for 50 times more violence in Congress
[37:27.440 --> 37:29.200]  than Republicans ever did.
[37:29.200 --> 37:31.160]  And of course, they had the motive for January 6.
[37:31.160 --> 37:34.760]  They wrote that big time magazine article, the secret conspiracy that, you know, help
[37:34.760 --> 37:39.120]  get rid of Trump where they brag that they basically suckered us on January 6.
[37:39.120 --> 37:42.760]  I mean, it's so incredible and they're scared right now.
[37:42.760 --> 37:43.760]  They're scared.
[37:43.760 --> 37:48.320]  So in this clip, you're going to take over next segment, police play, the Jeffrey Epstein
[37:48.320 --> 37:50.360]  piece, which is going to be a bigger piece.
[37:50.360 --> 37:54.640]  But this is just one little intro piece I shot that drew here with me.
[37:54.640 --> 37:56.440]  The great camera guy thought was good.
[37:56.440 --> 38:00.480]  And I think it is a good little four minute piece of going and visiting that dungeon.
[38:00.480 --> 38:02.360]  So that's coming up the start of the next segment.
[38:02.360 --> 38:06.120]  It's posted in FullWars.com the way the dog hunts, folks, as you share the article.
[38:06.120 --> 38:10.880]  So if we create this great research and get it out, you're just as good.
[38:10.880 --> 38:13.200]  This is important with you carrying the ball.
[38:13.200 --> 38:14.840]  So that's coming up next segment.
[38:14.840 --> 38:20.040]  But here is this sick little clip of this arrogant, dangerous man who doesn't just say
[38:20.040 --> 38:21.040]  criminal things.
[38:21.040 --> 38:25.240]  He has a criminal look to him just to, just an unsavory sliminess.
[38:25.240 --> 38:26.240]  Here he is.
[38:26.240 --> 38:34.080]  So FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on January 6, according to
[38:34.080 --> 38:36.600]  government documents.
[38:36.600 --> 38:38.400]  And those two are not alone.
[38:38.400 --> 38:43.520]  Then all revolver news reported there are, quote, upwards of 20 unindicted co-conspirators
[38:43.520 --> 38:48.200]  in the Oathkeeper indictments, all playing various roles in the conspiracy who have not
[38:48.200 --> 38:52.960]  been charged for virtually the exact same activities and in some cases much, much more
[38:52.960 --> 38:57.880]  severe activities as those named alongside them in the indictments.
[38:57.880 --> 38:58.880]  Huh?
[38:58.880 --> 39:05.120]  So it turns out that this white supremacist insurrection was, again, by the government's
[39:05.120 --> 39:12.080]  own admission in these documents organized at least in part by government agents.
[39:12.080 --> 39:13.080]  Frank, it's all yours.
[39:13.080 --> 39:14.080]  Over to you.
[39:14.080 --> 39:20.320]  Well, Tucker can pick one or two choices.
[39:20.320 --> 39:24.960]  He can plead total ignorance of what unindicted co-conspirator means or he can admit that
[39:24.960 --> 39:26.680]  he's trying to deceive the public.
[39:26.680 --> 39:28.360]  It's one or the other.
[39:28.360 --> 39:29.360]  Maybe both.
[39:29.360 --> 39:31.360]  That's not what unindicted co-conspirator means.
[39:31.360 --> 39:39.040]  And in fact, if there were FBI operatives inside the crowd and they would never be charged
[39:39.040 --> 39:42.360]  as unindicted co-conspirators, this makes absolutely no sense.
[39:42.360 --> 39:44.320]  But I'll tell you what does make sense, Brian.
[39:44.320 --> 39:49.760]  We've learned just today through MSNBC and NBC News reporting that at least one of the
[39:49.760 --> 39:55.920]  defendants in the January 6 case has been asked by FBI agents, do you know anyone in
[39:55.920 --> 39:57.040]  Congress?
[39:57.040 --> 40:02.120]  And so now when you put those two things together, there's some interest in the GOP in Congress
[40:02.120 --> 40:07.440]  spreading this disinformation that was the FBI who did all of this on January 6.
[40:07.440 --> 40:08.440]  Why?
[40:08.440 --> 40:12.600]  Because just maybe, just maybe, the FBI's looking at them.
[40:12.600 --> 40:16.960]  And just maybe you're not a big fat lying evil demon with those other demons, Brian Williams,
[40:16.960 --> 40:21.080]  on that discredited channel with how he, you know, shot, hey, frankly, you shot down the
[40:21.080 --> 40:25.920]  helicopter along with Brian Williams as well, or maybe you, you know, you're secretly the
[40:25.920 --> 40:27.920]  first man to walk on the moon.
[40:27.920 --> 40:32.800]  So oh, and at least he's not like two weeks ago showing we need to attack, quote, attack
[40:32.800 --> 40:36.640]  Congress because they're terrorists, but they're really showing us who they are.
[40:36.640 --> 40:40.120]  And it's again, they're so scared of this story.
[40:40.120 --> 40:44.080]  But we've also got to understand, remember, folks, the big Jamie White article with all
[40:44.080 --> 40:48.800]  the emails, infowars.com, get it, share it, Google, and I love Jamie.
[40:48.800 --> 40:52.680]  He's a great researcher, he has amazing jobs, one of our best people, but it's not even
[40:52.680 --> 40:53.680]  hardcore enough.
[40:53.680 --> 40:58.840]  You know, the headline is, oh, Google was funding, you know, the head of the Wulon operation.
[40:58.840 --> 41:00.120]  It's much worse than that.
[41:00.120 --> 41:06.480]  They were funding in getting zoological viruses that could jump into humans and creating the
[41:06.480 --> 41:10.640]  cover story three and a half, four years ago, they were developing this whole plan.
[41:10.640 --> 41:16.760]  So both of these things are coming out and it's critical continue to come out to discredit
[41:16.760 --> 41:20.680]  the entire globalist rollout because if we don't, they're going to just clamp back new
[41:20.680 --> 41:24.400]  restrictions with some new virus very, very soon, that's been their plan.
[41:24.400 --> 41:27.640]  Total siege, total war, total censorship.
[41:27.640 --> 41:30.000]  But think about Google, Owen, censoring everybody.
[41:30.000 --> 41:36.080]  All of these last year and a half when they, of course, were involved in the thing the entire
[41:36.080 --> 41:37.080]  time.
[41:37.080 --> 41:38.080]  All right, I'm going to bow out.
[41:38.080 --> 41:40.680]  Owen, thanks for having me on while you were supposed to be hosting.
[41:40.680 --> 41:41.680]  You're doing a great job.
[41:41.680 --> 41:46.400]  And you've got the Jeffrey Epstein report coming up the start of the next segment and then so
[41:46.400 --> 41:52.000]  much more with Owen Shroyer and the top White House doctor coming out and saying Biden needs
[41:52.000 --> 41:53.000]  a cognitive test.
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.000]  Yeah, obviously.
[41:54.000 --> 42:23.880]  M4Wars.com, tomorrow's news today, we'll be right back.
[42:23.880 --> 42:44.080]  Thank you for watching.
[42:53.880 --> 43:05.160]  The equation is very simple the mega banks control the media they control big
[43:05.160 --> 43:11.440]  pharma they control academia they control military industrial complex they
[43:11.440 --> 43:16.560]  control big tech and everywhere that they have been in control in the third
[43:16.560 --> 43:22.600]  world they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization it
[43:22.600 --> 43:27.240]  is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that
[43:27.240 --> 43:31.160]  promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them so
[43:31.160 --> 43:36.040]  because they can't defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted
[43:36.040 --> 43:42.000]  turn it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.160]  freedom and the free market that threatens their monopoly so control
[43:46.160 --> 43:50.720]  that's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to the feeding
[43:50.720 --> 43:55.440]  of the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and bad
[43:55.440 --> 44:00.560]  that video so we double your efforts we're all in this together I started
[44:00.560 --> 44:04.640]  taking high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil more than a decade ago because
[44:04.640 --> 44:07.560]  the scientific literature is overwhelming it's good for your heart
[44:07.560 --> 44:11.680]  your brain your whole body your well-being a lot of folks take it before
[44:11.680 --> 44:16.160]  they take tests people in hemarthritis pain they take it it's well known for
[44:16.160 --> 44:20.720]  the things it does for a body it makes our lives so much better then I learned
[44:20.720 --> 44:25.200]  about high-grade fish oil and high-grade krill oil we've got both info
[44:25.200 --> 44:28.960]  or store.com but with the COVID lockdown supply chains are broken down so it's
[44:28.960 --> 44:32.640]  been months and months and months since we've had krill oil back at stock well
[44:32.640 --> 44:35.640]  it's back ladies and gentlemen and despite the fact that it's already very
[44:35.640 --> 44:41.240]  fairly priced for the grade it is highest quality we're offering it at 40% off for
[44:41.240 --> 44:45.520]  a limited time and info or store.com with free shipping and double-paid
[44:45.520 --> 44:48.400]  free appoints because I want those of you that have already been customers have a
[44:48.400 --> 44:51.200]  chance to get more of it and I want new viewers and listeners who haven't
[44:51.200 --> 44:55.720]  tried it to get it from us and then try regular krill oil that is not one-tenth
[44:55.720 --> 44:59.840]  as powerful as ours this is the highest grade back at stock info or store.com
[44:59.840 --> 45:05.600]  info wars is here because there's a war on for your mind that's why I spent our
[45:05.600 --> 45:10.040]  motto for more than 25 years and if you research even the UN's own admissions
[45:10.040 --> 45:14.080]  over two billion people on planet Earth out of seven and a half billion have
[45:14.080 --> 45:19.240]  cognitive disabilities lower IQ because of lack of iodine that's why they work
[45:19.240 --> 45:23.280]  to make sure iodine isn't in the food isn't in the salt anymore now regular
[45:23.280 --> 45:28.800]  iodine that you find in food is bound to different minerals and so it's hard for
[45:28.800 --> 45:32.840]  your body to absorb but if you get the proper type of iodine there's three types
[45:32.840 --> 45:36.280]  that are good for the body it does amazing things it's essential in the body
[45:36.280 --> 45:40.960]  but we have our amazing tri iodine a big shipment came in and so we're able to
[45:40.960 --> 45:46.920]  offer it at the lowest price ever 60% off that is survival shield x3 60% off
[45:46.920 --> 45:52.360]  with three types of powerful iodine tri iodine is from a patented process that
[45:52.360 --> 45:56.240]  stabilizes the iodine it makes even more powerful the cellular level you and
[45:56.240 --> 45:59.000]  your family will love it it's incredible for your body get it info
[45:59.000 --> 46:21.000]  we're short on today you're listening to the alex jones show
[46:21.000 --> 46:27.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[46:27.680 --> 46:36.880]  tyranny will so does he lie from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[46:37.160 --> 46:44.240]  east 71st Street in the middle of Manhattan New York USA and that is
[46:44.240 --> 46:52.040]  st. James church we're at a very important site here this is a place I
[46:52.040 --> 46:57.120]  began to expose more than 15 years ago from sources I had who were telling me
[46:57.120 --> 47:01.680]  that there were powerful individuals that were running underage sex rings to
[47:01.680 --> 47:05.360]  compromise not just politicians but corporate leaders particularly
[47:05.360 --> 47:09.920]  scientific leaders and they had an island in the Caribbean where underage
[47:09.920 --> 47:13.800]  girls and others were taken where they did rituals and were children were even
[47:13.800 --> 47:18.120]  killed well as you know in the last three or four years it's come out the
[47:18.120 --> 47:23.680]  Jeffrey Epstein was running that network but Jeffrey Epstein was just a pimp
[47:23.680 --> 47:28.440]  Jeffrey Epstein was just a frontman and when he died the networks that he was
[47:28.440 --> 47:32.960]  the front man for that he was like a butler for have continued on with the
[47:32.960 --> 47:37.720]  British royal family and others using these systems to compromise the
[47:37.720 --> 47:43.240]  leadership of not just the United States but the world and so Bill Gates
[47:43.240 --> 47:49.720]  Bill Gates and so many other Titans of industry have stayed in the address I'm
[47:49.720 --> 47:54.600]  about to show you for months and months and months at a time they've also stayed
[47:54.600 --> 47:59.360]  at facilities in Paris facilities in London facilities in New Mexico like
[47:59.360 --> 48:05.520]  Zorro Ranch they have spent massive amounts of time inside buildings like
[48:05.520 --> 48:11.160]  this seven-story facility that just recently sold were told for twenty five
[48:11.160 --> 48:17.680]  million dollars it's Jeffrey Epstein's former headquarters in New York City
[48:17.680 --> 48:24.320]  and we're here producing a special report for free world news TV and info
[48:24.320 --> 48:28.400]  wars calm that's gonna be on the next few weeks and the question is what is the
[48:28.400 --> 48:35.160]  center of the web is it the Bilderberg group is it the club of Rome is it
[48:35.160 --> 48:41.680]  organizations like Bohemian Grove well skull and bones is corrupt and evil and
[48:41.680 --> 48:46.800]  set up by very vicious people so we're all these organizations but what is the
[48:46.800 --> 48:53.240]  center of that web so so so here we are just a prelude for viewers of free world
[48:53.240 --> 48:59.760]  news dot TV at the famous keypad that so many pimps brought underage girls to to
[48:59.760 --> 49:05.280]  bring them inside that seven-story building so that sex crimes to be
[49:05.280 --> 49:11.360]  committed so that they could be compromised and it's the network that
[49:11.360 --> 49:17.360]  still controls FC today that we are here to expose but Bill Gates who took
[49:17.360 --> 49:21.920]  control of all the major world health departments the planet Bill Gates who
[49:21.920 --> 49:27.600]  is trying to force inoculations on us to bring in a world dictatorship a world
[49:27.600 --> 49:33.520]  economy a world social credit score a world ID Bill Gates was evident shows
[49:33.520 --> 49:37.680]  in charge of Jeffrey Epstein that's why Jeffrey Epstein had to die there were
[49:37.680 --> 49:43.000]  people above Bill Gates so we're here in New York City to investigate the roots
[49:43.000 --> 49:48.200]  of how the corruption and how the blackmail operates into expose but it
[49:48.200 --> 49:52.200]  is those doors that Prince Andrew was famously photographed staring out as
[49:52.200 --> 49:56.760]  young women came in and out it's those doors that famously Bill Gates was caught
[49:56.760 --> 50:01.360]  going into and having parties it's those doors that the system didn't want us to
[50:01.360 --> 50:05.120]  know about because they wanted to use that blackmail but that control to
[50:05.120 --> 50:09.000]  control the people that control our lives and remember many of the people
[50:09.000 --> 50:13.000]  that came to be compromised here and to engage in sex crimes did it as a gang
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.880]  initiation you've all heard of Crips and Bloods they got to either kill another
[50:16.880 --> 50:19.320]  member of the other gang or like shoot some innocent person that works in
[50:19.320 --> 50:23.320]  liquor store you remember the Mexican mafia you've heard of the Italian mafia
[50:23.320 --> 50:27.640]  the hillbillies all of them have to commit a crime be part of the club but
[50:27.640 --> 50:30.640]  in prison you get killed if you're a pedophile nobody puts up with that one
[50:30.640 --> 50:34.440]  of her children this is the ultimate cult because to get in their cult you've
[50:34.440 --> 50:37.900]  got to abuse children and that's what this facility is about that's why
[50:37.900 --> 50:43.360]  Bacchus the Roman god of debauchery and evil is above the door and up on the
[50:43.360 --> 50:47.920]  top there's images of little naked children dancing ladies and gentlemen is
[50:47.920 --> 50:53.920]  that why Jeffrey F. St. picked this facility for his worldwide headquarters of
[50:53.920 --> 50:58.720]  evil and did he name that little island he bought in the Caribbean little St.
[50:58.720 --> 51:03.840]  James after the church St. James that's just down the block this is part of our
[51:03.840 --> 51:07.800]  ongoing investigation that only you by supporting us have allowed us to continue
[51:07.800 --> 51:12.080]  on and thanks to you we have the courage and the funding and the resolve to never
[51:12.080 --> 51:16.320]  stop so the controllers of Jeffrey Epstein you may have killed him but you've
[51:16.320 --> 51:24.360]  not killed the secret of what he was doing and he will be exposed and of course
[51:24.360 --> 51:29.720]  you can find that report from Alex Jones at band.video Alex Jones visit
[51:29.720 --> 51:34.480]  Jeffrey Epstein's New York Dungeon Boyle Boyle you know the Jeffrey Epstein
[51:34.480 --> 51:39.280]  story really isn't dead is it I'm like Epstein
[51:39.280 --> 51:47.600]  suicided in a jail cell and they expect us to believe that he hung himself with
[51:47.600 --> 51:54.560]  toilet paper yes I'm sure that's how it went down and of course he had the
[51:54.560 --> 52:01.000]  cloning lab in New Mexico he had the pedophile island he had at the torture
[52:01.000 --> 52:08.440]  dungeon in New York where the elites would go hang out media is not interested
[52:08.440 --> 52:12.120]  in that if anything they're interested in covering it up just like Amy Roebuck
[52:12.120 --> 52:20.720]  Amy Roebuck had to admit the ABC News reporter why would the mainstream media
[52:20.720 --> 52:28.960]  have an interest in covering up Jeffrey Epstein's massive industrial level sex
[52:28.960 --> 52:37.320]  trafficking operation blackmail operation and you know I think it ties
[52:37.320 --> 52:43.640]  into something that we had in the last segment and guys if you can go back to
[52:43.640 --> 52:49.280]  that figliozzi figlione whatever his name is that that FBI corrupt agent that
[52:49.280 --> 52:57.320]  goes on MSNBC in the last 15 seconds he tells you what their next move is so
[52:57.320 --> 53:04.120]  guys can we just queue up the final 15 seconds of that clip is that possible so
[53:04.120 --> 53:07.960]  I want you to listen listen carefully forget about the fact that he's still
[53:07.960 --> 53:11.360]  lying about the January 6 and everything listen carefully to what he
[53:11.360 --> 53:17.280]  insinuates at the end of this clip in his denial that there are federal agents
[53:17.280 --> 53:23.760]  involved in January 6 which is just a fact we have the official documents that
[53:23.760 --> 53:27.520]  say that that's exactly what happened and we know that they ran similar things
[53:27.520 --> 53:37.520]  like in Michigan with the plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer a bunch of feds that
[53:37.520 --> 53:41.400]  came out to so it'll come out with the January 6 deal but listen carefully to
[53:41.400 --> 53:46.560]  what figliozzi figliozzi says at the end of this and understand the assertion
[53:46.560 --> 53:53.000]  or that that he's showing their hand right now about what is gonna come next
[53:53.000 --> 53:59.920]  listen closely case has been asked by FBI agents do you know anyone in Congress
[53:59.920 --> 54:04.280]  and so now when you put those two things together there's some interest in the
[54:04.280 --> 54:09.000]  GOP in Congress spreading this disinformation that was the FBI who
[54:09.000 --> 54:14.440]  did all this on January 6 why because just maybe just maybe the FBI is looking
[54:14.440 --> 54:22.240]  at them so he's now saying what he just said was that the FBI is now looking at
[54:22.240 --> 54:29.920]  people who communicate with individuals that were in DC on January 6 if you
[54:29.920 --> 54:34.800]  communicated with somebody who was in DC on January the 6 the FBI is looking at
[54:34.800 --> 54:45.680]  you that's what he just said boy whether there were FBI agents involved in
[54:45.680 --> 54:55.960]  January 6 or not that's a pretty pretty aggressive isn't it yeah that is pretty
[54:55.960 --> 55:02.240]  totalitarian isn't it oh you talked to someone that was in DC on January the
[55:02.240 --> 55:07.120]  6 we're gonna investigate you now doesn't matter that in Chicago you have
[55:07.120 --> 55:11.120]  record homicide rates now they literally I wasn't gonna cover it tonight
[55:11.120 --> 55:14.760]  Harrison Smith might be covering it on Sunday night live I was gonna cover it
[55:14.760 --> 55:19.000]  tomorrow in the war room but in Chicago now they stop the gangs the white
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.040]  supremacists yes the white supremacist gangs stop your car pull you out of it
[55:24.040 --> 55:29.880]  in the middle of the street and then execute you yeah mainstream media is
[55:29.880 --> 55:33.360]  not interested in covering any of that record homicides in Chicago you had a
[55:33.360 --> 55:40.320]  mass shooting eight people dead one shooting where was the media on that you
[55:40.320 --> 55:48.120]  know why you know why they didn't cover that because every person involved
[55:48.120 --> 55:55.320]  wasn't white see so black people shooting black people every day in
[55:55.320 --> 56:02.840]  Chicago is a non-story for them a non-interest for black lives matter but
[56:02.840 --> 56:08.440]  the FBI can sit here and watch people get drug out of their cars in Chicago
[56:08.440 --> 56:13.440]  and murdered in the middle of the street a Juneteenth parade in Oakland resulted
[56:13.440 --> 56:17.280]  in a mass shooting again a bunch of white supremacists that's code word for
[56:17.280 --> 56:23.120]  a well whatever you want it to be I suppose but the FBI can't do anything
[56:23.120 --> 56:27.840]  about that they can't stop the record homicides in Chicago and Baltimore and
[56:27.840 --> 56:31.560]  the record violent crime and all run Democrat run major cities they have no
[56:31.560 --> 56:34.920]  interest what they're doing is they're looking at anybody who was in DC on
[56:34.920 --> 56:41.040]  January the 6th and now if Fig Luzi is telling the truth they're also looking
[56:41.040 --> 56:46.080]  at who they communicated with and so yeah they'll be like oh you communicated
[56:46.080 --> 56:49.920]  with someone on January the 6th we're gonna bring you in now too all the evil

[59:24.280 --> 59:27.360]  Alex Jones show Harrison Smith will be hosting Sunday Night Live tonight I know
[59:27.360 --> 59:32.520]  he's got a lot of news to cover I am going to play a video clip now and then
[59:32.520 --> 59:36.840]  come back in the next segment cover all of this news and then open the phone
[59:36.840 --> 59:46.600]  lines but first let's go to another this is trending now another young American
[59:46.600 --> 59:53.840]  student who obviously parents are sick of it friends are sick of it students are
[59:53.840 --> 59:57.320]  sick of it whether it's critical race theory or whether it's forcing them to
[59:57.320 --> 1:00:01.360]  wear a mask the students are sick of all of it so now they're going to parent
[1:00:01.360 --> 1:00:06.640]  teacher meetings and speaking or having like their own I don't know what what
[1:00:06.640 --> 1:00:11.120]  meetings you're seeing all the time now where these students are speaking and
[1:00:11.120 --> 1:00:15.400]  where these parents are speaking all against the masks and against the
[1:00:15.400 --> 1:00:18.800]  critical race theory it's just totally rejected but you know the liberals that
[1:00:18.800 --> 1:00:21.800]  run the schools want to run your life so even though it's totally unpopular they
[1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:26.160]  want to do it anyway and so here's another young American telling it like it
[1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:30.920]  is in front of her school board and in front of her classmates and in front of
[1:00:30.920 --> 1:00:35.960]  the parents of her school it's amazing it's amazing to have young Americans
[1:00:35.960 --> 1:00:40.200]  speaking out like this here it is here again the other day I was walking down
[1:00:40.200 --> 1:00:43.840]  the hallway at Lakeview Elementary School to give a teacher a retiring gift I
[1:00:43.840 --> 1:00:49.600]  looked up onto the wall and saw BLM poster and an Amanda Gorman poster in case
[1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:53.440]  you don't know who that chick is she's some girl who did a poem at Biden's so
[1:00:53.440 --> 1:00:59.400]  called inauguration I was so mad I was told two weeks ago at this very meeting
[1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:05.240]  spot no politics in school I believe what you said at this meeting so at lunch I
[1:01:05.240 --> 1:01:09.120]  went up to my principal to tell him about the BLM poster and that I wanted it
[1:01:09.120 --> 1:01:13.640]  down he said it's not coming down I was like yeah it is because the school board
[1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:21.000]  said on May 25th no BLM or politics in school he said that's weird they were
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:25.680]  the ones who they were the ones who made them I was stunned when I was here two
[1:01:25.680 --> 1:01:30.160]  weeks ago you told us to report any BLM in our schools apparently you know
[1:01:30.160 --> 1:01:35.160]  they're in our schools because you made the signs I said there should be no BLM
[1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:39.080]  in schools period does not matter the color you make the posters and the
[1:01:39.080 --> 1:01:44.080]  font you use we all understand the meaning it is a political message about
[1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:48.760]  getting rid of police officers rioting burning buildings down while King
[1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:54.200]  Governor waltz just sits on his throne and watches we all know changing the
[1:01:54.200 --> 1:01:58.320]  font or the color of posters does not change the meaning I am nine years old
[1:01:58.320 --> 1:02:02.200]  and I know that you expect me to believe that you did not know what you were
[1:02:02.200 --> 1:02:07.080]  doing by making these posters come on people I do not judge people by the
[1:02:07.080 --> 1:02:11.000]  color of their skin I just I don't really care what color their hair skin or
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  eyes is I've judged by the content or the way they treat me MLK said I have a
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:20.480]  dream that one day my four little children will not be judged by the color
[1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:24.440]  of their skin but by the content of their character that dream has come true I
[1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:29.160]  do not care look at the color of skin but you make me think of it I have Asian
[1:02:29.160 --> 1:02:34.040]  Mexican white Chinese black friends and I don't care I like them because some of
[1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:37.720]  them make me laugh some are sweet and kind sporty or share the love of God
[1:02:37.720 --> 1:02:42.040]  they're just my friends you have lied to me and I'm very disappointed in all of
[1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:45.960]  you you cannot even follow your own rules if you're gonna do that why don't we
[1:02:45.960 --> 1:02:49.880]  follow any rules we deemed unfit or ridiculous I'm not following your
[1:02:49.880 --> 1:02:54.400]  mask rule anymore then get the posters out of our schools courage is contagious
[1:02:54.400 --> 1:03:01.720]  should be courageous Wow there's the story at Gateway Pundit nine-year-old
[1:03:01.720 --> 1:03:06.800]  Minnesota girl obliterate school board over BLM posters you know you have all
[1:03:06.800 --> 1:03:13.680]  these videos you know the left is creating with their offspring the next
[1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:20.280]  generation of victims and just sexually deviant confused people and that's what
[1:03:20.280 --> 1:03:23.680]  you see them celebrating with their kids you know cross-dressing them putting
[1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:26.400]  fake penises in their diapers I mean literally this is what they're doing I'm
[1:03:26.400 --> 1:03:29.640]  sorry I'm just telling you and so that's what the left is raising in their
[1:03:29.640 --> 1:03:31.960]  kids and then look at what conservatives are raising they're actually
[1:03:31.960 --> 1:03:37.360]  raising the next leaders of America that girl is nine years old and better
[1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:42.960]  spoken than most politicians that I hear speak so it's incredible to see this
[1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:47.560]  pan out so good on the parents of that girl good on all the parents out there
[1:03:47.560 --> 1:03:51.160]  today all the great fathers out there today raising their kids right to be the
[1:03:51.160 --> 1:03:55.320]  next leaders of this great nation that's what we need so the left will have a

[1:05:53.760 --> 1:06:00.280]  swath of news in in classic Harrison Smith style as he does every morning on
[1:06:00.280 --> 1:06:06.160]  the American Journal all right where to begin because I don't have much news on
[1:06:06.160 --> 1:06:09.840]  my desk but there are some very important stories that we have here so
[1:06:09.840 --> 1:06:16.720]  let's just start with this now I was stunned when I found this out I guess
[1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:24.040]  Friday evening maybe it was that Ronnie Jackson the former White House
[1:06:24.040 --> 1:06:30.640]  physician for Obama and then for Trump who came out and demanded in in a
[1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:40.480]  scathing words demanded a cognition test be done by Joe Biden president Joe
[1:06:40.480 --> 1:06:47.120]  Biden and of course he makes reference to at least with Trump how when Trump was
[1:06:47.120 --> 1:06:52.640]  getting all this pressure from the media and attacked by his colleagues he stepped
[1:06:52.640 --> 1:06:58.880]  up and he took the cognition test and and physician Ronnie Jackson Dr. Jackson
[1:06:58.880 --> 1:07:01.960]  said he aced it he aced the test ever president Trump was very proud of that
[1:07:01.960 --> 1:07:07.920]  and of course he did here's a guy who for 70 years has done nothing but but work
[1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:12.200]  which I think is actually good for your health you know you can't overload but
[1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:22.360]  never did drugs never drank so he's got that going for him but see that was a
[1:07:22.360 --> 1:07:27.720]  huge media story you couldn't turn on the TV or flip to your favorite internet
[1:07:27.720 --> 1:07:33.680]  or you couldn't go anywhere it was all about Trump the cognition test and
[1:07:33.680 --> 1:07:37.640]  everything whether it was positive or negative I was stunned that I didn't
[1:07:37.640 --> 1:07:43.520]  even hear about this and in fact I think he made this statement originally on
[1:07:43.520 --> 1:07:49.200]  Thursday of last week and the only reason I found out about it just because
[1:07:49.200 --> 1:07:54.640]  I'm a media junkie and just listened about 10 to 15 hours of talk radio all
[1:07:54.640 --> 1:07:57.760]  the time so I mean I feel like I can eventually find anything that's out
[1:07:57.760 --> 1:08:05.440]  there no coverage of this I didn't even see this covered on Fox News so if
[1:08:05.440 --> 1:08:08.320]  you're listening and you're and you're thinking huh how did I not hear about
[1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:13.200]  that I had the same I had the same reaction when I found out about it late
[1:08:13.200 --> 1:08:19.280]  Friday night imagine if you had the same coverage of how they said Trump was
[1:08:19.280 --> 1:08:25.160]  mentally unfit and then he took the test and then they covered the test but see
[1:08:25.160 --> 1:08:30.480]  that's the media protecting Biden the same effort the same energy that the
[1:08:30.480 --> 1:08:35.640]  media had to attack Trump is now being applied to protect Biden so there won't
[1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:39.600]  be any media pressure for Biden to take the cognition test there won't be any
[1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:45.240]  media coverage of this next week nobody will even mention it
[1:08:45.520 --> 1:08:53.080]  Biden and look at this see this even goes back to last year X White House
[1:08:53.080 --> 1:08:57.320]  position Roddy Jackson convinced Biden not fit for office that was October of
[1:08:57.320 --> 1:09:02.320]  last year so he already knew this everybody knew this
[1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:10.840]  everybody knows it today but there's the media protecting Joe Biden and we had
[1:09:10.840 --> 1:09:16.440]  journalists that actually crunched the numbers and that whole thing about
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:22.720]  Russian you know strong-arming the media is probably just another Russian lie
[1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:27.960]  it's just you know how they just lie about Russia the boogeyman here but so
[1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:34.360]  Putin after the summit took 24 questions from the press for an hour and had no
[1:09:34.360 --> 1:09:41.800]  notes Biden took seven pre-prepared questions and it lasted 11 minutes and
[1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:47.080]  he also had his cue cards in hand for the whole thing so tell me which one's a
[1:09:47.080 --> 1:09:52.200]  communist dictatorship which is really a world leader and which is a total fraud
[1:09:52.200 --> 1:10:00.520]  everybody knows that Biden can't think can't talk is a total embarrassment gets
[1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:05.520]  lost I mean he shows all the signs he'll be in a speech and then in the middle of
[1:10:05.520 --> 1:10:08.320]  the speech you'll see someone he'll knows and he knows he'll be like oh hey
[1:10:08.320 --> 1:10:12.920]  that's my guy over there hey yeah yeah that's my guy that works over at the
[1:10:12.920 --> 1:10:18.360]  place and does the thing yeah hey hey buddy anyway yeah where was I here oh
[1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:22.720]  boy I'm gonna get in trouble they tell me not to say this haha oh they gave me
[1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:30.720]  some note cards haha and there's the media they won't cover Biden clearly not
[1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:34.240]  being fit they won't cover White House physicians demanding he take a
[1:10:34.240 --> 1:10:37.640]  cognitive test so Biden won't have to take it and he would obviously fail it
[1:10:37.640 --> 1:10:48.120]  if he did in some international news top Chinese nuclear scientists found
[1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:53.880]  dead under mysterious circumstances uh-huh yeah one of China's top nuclear
[1:10:53.880 --> 1:10:57.120]  scientists and the vice president of Harbin Engineering University died after
[1:10:57.120 --> 1:11:06.440]  falling from a building hmm boy you think some foul play is is being talked
[1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:12.720]  about in that situation yeah a lot of it actually so there you go there in other
[1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:17.120]  international news well it's sticking China this is wild the crew handed this
[1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:29.880]  to me earlier it's like the lady who did that report saying why are all these
[1:11:29.880 --> 1:11:35.600]  energy companies making steps to hire to basically replace their entire work
[1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:40.760]  staff in the next two years is it because all these people got vaccinated
[1:11:40.760 --> 1:11:47.600]  they're gonna die and then you have this so so here's the headline but the
[1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:51.400]  headline is not really the story market closed main freight chairman Bruce
[1:11:51.400 --> 1:11:57.400]  plested sells 75 million worth of shares so it that's just some random story but
[1:11:57.400 --> 1:12:01.560]  then in the story is an interesting little nugget that the crew found hat
[1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:08.240]  tipped to the crew fire hey China's largest infant formula maker said sales
[1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:12.040]  would drop sharply in the next one to two years since many women cannot bear
[1:12:12.040 --> 1:12:16.920]  children within six months of coronavirus vaccination and thus delaying
[1:12:16.920 --> 1:12:25.280]  births huh is this an admitted side effect and how how would you even be
[1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:34.440]  able to know that it's only for six months now you start to look at China who
[1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:40.080]  was making a COVID vaccine in 2019 before any of this came out so maybe
[1:12:40.080 --> 1:12:44.000]  China's already had the COVID vaccine trials and so maybe they know yeah for
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:47.320]  six months you can't have a baby but then after that you can or maybe they
[1:12:47.320 --> 1:12:51.720]  really don't know they just know that now that the vaccine's been out for six
[1:12:51.720 --> 1:12:55.640]  months and I guess no woman's had a baby since giving it or they've had miscarriages
[1:12:55.640 --> 1:12:59.000]  so they just say well we just assume if you get the vaccine for six months you're
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:05.520]  not having a baby it's kind of the same thing of yeah don't have a mammogram
[1:13:05.520 --> 1:13:09.760]  after getting the COVID vaccine you'll show up you have breast cancer or for
[1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:13.480]  men shows up as all these cancers so but don't worry you're not as just you know
[1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:17.040]  that's just a side effect of it looking like you have cancer you don't actually
[1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:20.720]  have cancer then you come back a year later well okay maybe you did have cancer
[1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:25.300]  but it's mostly the blood clotting and the fainting and the guion beret and the
[1:13:25.300 --> 1:13:32.920]  valve palsy little mix in a little death most vaccine deaths already for this
[1:13:32.920 --> 1:13:38.640]  COVID vaccine hasn't even been out a year and so you know we have to give a
[1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:42.760]  big shout out to the NFL players right now that are standing against this one
[1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:48.520]  in particular Cole Beasley or Cole Beasley Cole Beasley I can't remember
[1:13:48.520 --> 1:13:51.600]  he's a wide receiver for the Buffalo Bills now I believe he's even from
[1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:55.200]  Austin Texas and he just released a statement over the weekend basically
[1:13:55.200 --> 1:14:01.160]  saying this is total tyranny you can't force people to take a shot you know
[1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:03.800]  just just basically stating all the signs and just saying hey you know what
[1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:09.280]  I'm a free man I'm not gonna be turned into a slave and so it's just incredible
[1:14:09.280 --> 1:14:14.280]  yeah Cole Beasley and I think it was the GM or the owner of the team that said
[1:14:14.280 --> 1:14:18.160]  no we're gonna force our whole team to vaccinate so good for him for taking a
[1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:21.440]  stand others are taking a stand as well but he's been the he's been the vocal
[1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:27.320]  leader on the issue but I mean yeah oh yeah yeah don't go have a mammogram I
[1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:30.040]  show up you have cancer after you got the vaccine oh yeah don't worry that's
[1:14:30.040 --> 1:14:33.080]  just a blood clot from the vaccine oh yeah your whole left side is numb don't
[1:14:33.080 --> 1:14:37.880]  worry just sleep it off oh yeah women get the vaccine and you know they can't
[1:14:37.880 --> 1:14:42.800]  have babies but hey you know force it on you and then there's this jar canned
[1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:47.160]  man this is in India claims he has magnetic powers after taking COVID
[1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:51.520]  vaccine and then in this story in India today it's just he's just covered he's
[1:14:51.520 --> 1:14:55.000]  just a magnet he's literally just a human magnet and I did test myself I'm
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:59.800]  not magnetic still organic human I'm a very humble person but I'm also a bold
[1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:04.400]  person and so as bad as things are with the globalist attacking humanity with
[1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:07.360]  all the terrible things that are unfolding I want you to know a lot of
[1:15:07.360 --> 1:15:12.880]  positive things are happening as well I'm a public figure so I get to see things

[1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:26.800]  industry people are really really away from the establishment they don't want
[1:15:26.800 --> 1:15:30.080]  to go along with the globalist but they're scared they're looking for

[1:15:56.800 --> 1:16:03.200]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the
[1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:09.000]  petrochemical the petrochemical then dominated two major industries plastics
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:14.880]  and drugs companies began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced
[1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:20.160]  drugs the natural sources were then made illegal pharmaceuticals became

[1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:44.000]  there is an event happening today it's going on right now in downtown austin
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:50.640]  I was kind of wish I could be there not really but there are some reporters
[1:19:50.640 --> 1:19:54.520]  there I'll just put it that way they're gonna be asking these people some
[1:19:54.520 --> 1:19:58.240]  questions and democrats are rallying here at the capital to stop voter
[1:19:58.240 --> 1:20:04.480]  suppression that's the big democrat issue now is get whitey and stop voter
[1:20:04.480 --> 1:20:11.280]  suppression and so we'll see how it goes but let's just say I suggested are I
[1:20:11.280 --> 1:20:16.640]  told them what my tactic would have been and that would have been to ask them
[1:20:16.640 --> 1:20:19.760]  okay so you think there was voter suppression in 2020 and you know these
[1:20:19.760 --> 1:20:23.560]  people are very predictable oh absolutely so bad you know well voters
[1:20:23.560 --> 1:20:26.920]  oppression it's what the media told me to say it's what the democrats told me
[1:20:26.920 --> 1:20:31.760]  to say yes voters pressure really bad horrible in 2020 worst ever okay so how
[1:20:31.760 --> 1:20:45.120]  was it that you had record voter turnout by 20 million votes imagine that voter
[1:20:45.120 --> 1:20:52.160]  suppression even though on average usually more people vote every four
[1:20:52.160 --> 1:20:58.560]  years in the presidential election on average but in 2020 it was let me
[1:20:58.560 --> 1:21:05.640]  explosive you had two people receive record votes to that's if you just
[1:21:05.640 --> 1:21:10.280]  believe the false numbers but I mean so you had imagine you had 20 million a
[1:21:10.280 --> 1:21:16.520]  record voter turnout by 20 million and all the media the democrats do now is
[1:21:16.520 --> 1:21:22.880]  as a political activism is say stop voter suppression they think their voters
[1:21:22.880 --> 1:21:30.160]  are stupid and they are that they can run these shams run these sham campaigns
[1:21:30.160 --> 1:21:34.960]  and their voters eat it eat it up and and don't even think to look behind the
[1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:42.720]  curtain yeah voter suppression man yeah voter ideas waste is the television in
[1:21:42.720 --> 1:21:47.040]  the democrats told me voter so so voter suppression was really bad in 2020 is
[1:21:47.040 --> 1:21:51.080]  the worst ever really how did 20 million americans a record number of americans
[1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:55.480]  by 20 million how did that happen then a voter suppression and that's when the
[1:21:55.480 --> 1:22:01.160]  cult leader comes in and shuts the conversation down so we may be seeing
[1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:04.560]  some footage from that before the end of the night at band that video again it's
[1:22:04.560 --> 1:22:07.560]  just going on right now I would have been there if I didn't have to be on air

[1:25:08.320 --> 1:25:12.400]  of free speech in america's history i think since it's founding
[1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:19.040]  let's go to sky calling in from washington sky you're on the air go ahead
[1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:23.920]  thanks on get to talk to you you too one of the mention the fourth amendment
[1:25:23.920 --> 1:25:27.440]  here that we have the protection from unreasonable search and seizure
[1:25:27.440 --> 1:25:31.360]  and how that's being violated by big tech and it looks like uh
[1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:36.960]  as you covered one six may be used as a pretext to go after maybe even people
[1:25:36.960 --> 1:25:39.440]  calling into this show just for communicating with people who were
[1:25:39.440 --> 1:25:44.320]  there on one six yeah i mean it's clear what they really want to do with this
[1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:46.960]  i mean you know it's like it's clear you know you know you get kidnapped by
[1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:50.480]  jeffrey dommer what's going to happen so i mean if these people really get
[1:25:50.480 --> 1:25:53.440]  their hands on as we know what they're going to do
[1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:56.720]  they're in a holding pattern right now kind of feeling their oats thinking
[1:25:56.720 --> 1:26:01.040]  are we really about to do this like are we really about to go full totalitarian
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:04.400]  them just go just go public and just start arresting people we disagree with
[1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:08.960]  like are we really ready to go that far and i think that you know
[1:26:08.960 --> 1:26:13.680]  they know that uh that's their next move but now they're just kind of like boy i
[1:26:13.680 --> 1:26:17.760]  mean because that's been i mean that's major what's worldwide criminal
[1:26:17.760 --> 1:26:21.520]  activity i mean that's gangster mafia activity they won't be able to hide it
[1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:25.840]  anymore at that point that's when they cross the threshold of
[1:26:25.840 --> 1:26:29.280]  they can't even pretend to be anything other than totalitarians
[1:26:29.280 --> 1:26:33.840]  and dictators at that point so they're still like do we really want to arrest
[1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:38.160]  all these people uh and run this false flag and run this false narrative and
[1:26:38.160 --> 1:26:42.080]  and then arrest people over it i mean so yeah these are serious times there's no
[1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:45.440]  doubt that uh they're on the threshold of just
[1:26:45.440 --> 1:26:51.520]  becoming active totalitarians authoritarians and just just they can't
[1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:53.920]  even deny they'll just they'll just promote it and say we have to do this
[1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:57.920]  now because look at all the white supremacists yep i think that's why we
[1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:02.080]  need to spend more uh maga congress people to uh
[1:27:02.080 --> 1:27:06.400]  to uh congress we need to elect them uh like jill kent for example
[1:27:06.400 --> 1:27:10.080]  uh the guy who's running in washington uh yeah we got to get kent and
[1:27:10.080 --> 1:27:14.160]  shout out to that father today i know i feel for his family
[1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:18.240]  yeah we got jill kent would be an absolute champion to get in there
[1:27:18.240 --> 1:27:23.120]  i just wanted to mention one other thing oh and uh this total style these people
[1:27:23.120 --> 1:27:26.080]  who are trying to crack down on us like we've just been mentioning are the
[1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:30.560]  same people produce the documentary uh end game 2050 a
[1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:34.720]  total style and it's environmental extremism
[1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:38.240]  see i'm blowing the whistle on this because i used to work for greenpeace
[1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:41.920]  and uh this environmental extremism is uh
[1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:45.920]  it needs to be called out now do you think they'll start to be climate
[1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:49.520]  extremists like doing climate terror attacks and then they'll just say oh
[1:27:49.520 --> 1:27:53.840]  yeah but it's a good thing because we're killing the planet
[1:27:53.840 --> 1:27:57.360]  no i think environmental extremists are trying to get into your policies all
[1:27:57.360 --> 1:28:01.280]  the evil men in tarris seem to flourish as the good men do nothing
[1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:04.080]  well i'm trying to be a good man i'm trying to stand up do the right thing

[1:32:51.120 --> 1:32:54.960]  all cops are bad tearing down america's
[1:32:54.960 --> 1:32:58.640]  statues trying to raise our kids to be racist
[1:32:58.640 --> 1:33:04.240]  and now macy gray who hasn't been relevant in decades
[1:33:05.120 --> 1:33:08.800]  says it's time to replace the american flag
[1:33:08.800 --> 1:33:17.200]  and there it is yes yes the white bars offend her the most
[1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:25.840]  she doesn't like the white bars so she wants a new flag with off white
[1:33:25.840 --> 1:33:30.000]  and she wants i mean that's the flag she wants right there it's totally ugly
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:32.960]  but yeah you know so they're telling you who they are
[1:33:32.960 --> 1:33:37.840]  they hate america they want to sexualize your kids
[1:33:37.840 --> 1:33:41.680]  and they want massive government to run your life because they think they
[1:33:41.680 --> 1:33:44.240]  control it which really just shows how dumb
[1:33:44.240 --> 1:33:47.520]  they really are because if they were being
[1:33:47.520 --> 1:33:50.080]  honest and you said do you really want more government you like do you really
[1:33:50.080 --> 1:33:54.480]  want a government restricting your freedom i thought you were a liberal
[1:33:54.480 --> 1:33:58.080]  oh but see they think they control the government they control the cia they
[1:33:58.080 --> 1:34:00.720]  control all these things now and it's going after what they view as their
[1:34:00.720 --> 1:34:04.080]  political enemies so they like it now yeah we want that big government going
[1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:09.200]  after our political enemies yeah so yeah that's you know they're just
[1:34:09.200 --> 1:34:12.320]  telling you they hate all police they're racist
[1:34:12.320 --> 1:34:16.640]  hate america they want to get rid of the flag you can't say mother or father in
[1:34:16.640 --> 1:34:20.080]  congress anymore i mean yeah that's that's where they're at
[1:34:20.080 --> 1:34:25.280]  that's unpopular though it is very unpopular in fact
[1:34:25.280 --> 1:34:30.000]  the latest ratings are in fox news draws almost three times as many viewers as
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:33.680]  cnn which to me is just more evidence that trump
[1:34:33.680 --> 1:34:37.840]  won the election because the hate trump media outlets
[1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:41.120]  have no real audience so where all these
[1:34:41.120 --> 1:34:46.000]  biden voters coming from by the record numbers
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:51.200]  again though the democrats and the media are on this campaign of stopping
[1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:56.880]  voter suppression right now ignore they show no actual statistics they cite no
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:35:01.600]  actual examples it's all just this straw man argument of voter
[1:35:01.600 --> 1:35:04.880]  suppression that they just rally around
[1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:08.400]  and then but they don't actually provide any statistics or facts you know a
[1:35:08.400 --> 1:35:12.560]  normal liberals argument and so again if there's voter
[1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:15.760]  suppression how did we have a record voter turnout in the last
[1:35:15.760 --> 1:35:19.840]  presidential election by 20 million votes that's astronomical
[1:35:19.840 --> 1:35:23.120]  of course we all know why because they're about 20 million fake but votes for
[1:35:23.120 --> 1:35:27.120]  biden but see they won't even actually get into the
[1:35:27.120 --> 1:35:30.480]  statistics and the numbers they just want to say voter suppression racist and
[1:35:30.480 --> 1:35:34.320]  then feel good about themselves as they oppress and stop out
[1:35:34.320 --> 1:35:39.600]  the actual functioning society and civilization that we have
[1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:44.480]  let's go back to the phone lines and go to julie who's called in from maryland
[1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:48.320]  julie you're on the alex joneshow go ahead
[1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:51.920]  good evening oh and thank you so much for taking my phone call
[1:35:51.920 --> 1:35:56.240]  thanks for calling yep i've got a short bucket list i've talked to alex
[1:35:56.240 --> 1:36:00.480]  i've talked to harrison and now i've talked to you
[1:36:00.480 --> 1:36:04.800]  well there you go all goals attained listen up two points
[1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:08.640]  and my first one is is are we americans
[1:36:08.640 --> 1:36:14.160]  so short memory do we not elect a biracial most people call him black but
[1:36:14.160 --> 1:36:19.280]  he is i think he's biracial folks but did we not elect a black president for two
[1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:22.800]  terms i mean you could you could go off on all
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:26.400]  these different ways to prove that america is not racist you can use obama
[1:36:26.400 --> 1:36:30.000]  or all these other things here's the problem though where we present
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:34.960]  we present this logic assuming that that all parties are being equal
[1:36:34.960 --> 1:36:38.640]  and fair intellectually they're not liberals are just liars democrats are
[1:36:38.640 --> 1:36:41.760]  just liars i hate that i'm that way i don't want to be
[1:36:41.760 --> 1:36:46.000]  divisive and like have to call that's it liberals and democrats are just liars
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:50.320]  they don't live in reality they have this distorted worldview that they
[1:36:50.320 --> 1:36:54.480]  want to force on everybody else and they just lie so yeah
[1:36:54.480 --> 1:36:57.600]  yeah you can sit here all day long and say yeah look here's why america is not
[1:36:57.600 --> 1:37:01.200]  racist you can do it all day long but but the liberal isn't going to listen
[1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:06.240]  to you they don't care they're liars i agree and i hear you but we did
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:12.080]  elect a black president for two terms all right my third and final point
[1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:18.480]  i watched the saturday broadcast yesterday the emergency broadcast and i
[1:37:18.480 --> 1:37:22.560]  would not watch the last part with Steve Pacenek
[1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:29.120]  as far as i'm concerned and i can't believe him i think he's a shill
[1:37:29.120 --> 1:37:33.360]  and i'm just disappointed and i'm afraid for alex
[1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:36.960]  that why did he have Steve Pacenek on the show
[1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:44.480]  when he promised us hope and never never delivered on it and i question that
[1:37:44.480 --> 1:37:48.960]  and i really think info wars has to question why they had him on and if
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:52.320]  there's a good reason why i should listen to the last
[1:37:52.320 --> 1:37:56.560]  part of it i will but i do not like Steve Pacenek
[1:37:56.560 --> 1:38:01.600]  and i do not like info wars for having him on
[1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:05.520]  well uh you'd have to ask alex about yesterday's show i didn't watch the show
[1:38:05.520 --> 1:38:08.560]  with steve i know what you're talking about steve said that
[1:38:08.560 --> 1:38:11.520]  trump would be put in office and that they would find all these illegal
[1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:14.960]  ballots and then that none of that has happened as of yet and and i don't
[1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:18.080]  expect it to either i don't want to put words in alex's
[1:38:18.080 --> 1:38:21.280]  mouth steve has been coming on info wars for a long time
[1:38:21.280 --> 1:38:24.720]  he's always been uh you know one of the few people
[1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:28.240]  that has been supportive of alex over the decades
[1:38:28.240 --> 1:38:33.360]  and so you don't have to believe everything steve says obviously if uh
[1:38:33.360 --> 1:38:36.560]  if you don't like steve then tune out that's fine i don't think steve would
[1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:41.040]  take that personally uh but you know there's no nobody
[1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:46.320]  makes us have steve on uh but it's people a lot of people
[1:38:46.320 --> 1:38:49.360]  still like hearing steve so it's like kind of this come this dichotomy of
[1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:53.440]  people that don't want to ever see him again versus people who still
[1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:58.000]  liked every time he comes on even though uh
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:01.280]  even though he may be saying things that uh don't come true
[1:39:01.280 --> 1:39:05.280]  so i i don't know i i like steve personally i know him personally
[1:39:05.280 --> 1:39:08.880]  as far as the stuff he's reported recently it's not come true there's no
[1:39:08.880 --> 1:39:11.920]  doubt about that um but i i don't know what happened on
[1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:15.200]  yesterday's broadcast i really took yesterday off so i didn't watch that
[1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:18.880]  um and so i hope that you don't hold it against us that we have steve
[1:39:18.880 --> 1:39:21.680]  pochennecone because really if it's nothing else
[1:39:21.680 --> 1:39:25.040]  we just hear from all sides i mean we don't censor anybody here
[1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:28.400]  we will hear people that come on and disagree tell us things we don't agree
[1:39:28.400 --> 1:39:31.120]  with whatever so there's just no censorship there's no
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:36.480]  agenda here and we just hear all voices so i mean that but again as far as
[1:39:36.480 --> 1:39:40.160]  you know you ask why alex would have him on i mean i'm not going to speak for
[1:39:40.160 --> 1:39:43.040]  alex but uh but i i mean that that's my answer to
[1:39:43.040 --> 1:39:46.000]  your call julie and uh we appreciate you for calling
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:52.560]  in today let's go to is it uh alfonso alfano and indiana go

[1:39:57.120 --> 1:40:00.000]  you're on the air i'm your i'm your amish teacher belly
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:04.960]  hen gave me bassa if you remember that yeah that was okay you
[1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:08.480]  taught me how to say that i've forgotten it now yeah i got another good word at
[1:40:08.480 --> 1:40:12.320]  the end i'll tell you but anyways you know a year ago this didn't get any
[1:40:12.320 --> 1:40:15.360]  coverage and nobody's really talked about it yet today but
[1:40:15.360 --> 1:40:18.960]  they they did a luciferian march on washington
[1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:23.760]  to usher in revelations and in the the end times
[1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:27.760]  nobody reported on it i was there i'd actually report on it got got kicked off
[1:40:27.760 --> 1:40:30.720]  youtube from it but i just wanted to get up
[1:40:30.720 --> 1:40:34.800]  people aware of that in i'm telling you there you could
[1:40:34.800 --> 1:40:38.160]  you could cut evil with um blend woley from
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:42.640]  planet logic was here he did a podcast on me and it had me on a podcast about it
[1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:48.720]  but uh it you could feel evil oh and feel evil there
[1:40:48.720 --> 1:40:52.000]  well i know the feeling i mean i i walk into an abortion rally
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.400]  yeah an abortion rally they have abortion rallies
[1:40:54.400 --> 1:40:58.400]  and the first lady that i see has a sign that says hail satan
[1:40:58.400 --> 1:41:05.280]  oh yeah yeah so in you know i'll tell you after after yesterday in the last
[1:41:05.280 --> 1:41:11.600]  couple days blustin i i think i think the holy spirit's moving
[1:41:11.600 --> 1:41:15.360]  uh i really do well there's no doubt there's a great awakening happening the
[1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:19.200]  problem is it's like what alex was saying it's like
[1:41:19.200 --> 1:41:23.200]  what is the real barometer what is the real gauge all the media is fake almost
[1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:26.560]  all television is fake and so it's almost like info wars is
[1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:29.280]  really the only gauge so it's like yeah alex getting swamped and
[1:41:29.280 --> 1:41:32.720]  recognized or myself getting swamped to recognize that just shows the awakening
[1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:36.640]  is happening and it and it also shows that there's like
[1:41:36.640 --> 1:41:40.240]  a second booster waiting to fire like on a rocket ship because
[1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:44.320]  so many of these people that recognize us
[1:41:44.320 --> 1:41:48.320]  say i wish you were still on air or where can i find your stuff so like
[1:41:48.320 --> 1:41:51.360]  they've kind of just been lost in the abyss not even knowing thinking we've
[1:41:51.360 --> 1:41:54.400]  been shut down but we're still here we're still operating we're still on air
[1:41:54.400 --> 1:41:58.400]  we're still resisting the new world order

[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:05.840]  that's why i spent our motto for more than 25 years and if you research even

[1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:13.040]  and a half billion have cognitive disabilities
[1:42:13.040 --> 1:42:17.520]  lower iq because of lack of iodine that's why they work to make sure iodine

[1:44:09.200 --> 1:44:12.560]  and it's because we have so much credibility they can't allow us to stay

[1:44:15.360 --> 1:44:18.400]  stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons i can't tell you what's going

[1:45:14.400 --> 1:45:18.560]  the sun like me i was loaded up the sunspots or age spots as they're
[1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:21.920]  lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the last
[1:45:21.920 --> 1:45:25.120]  couple of years my skin is just really gorgeous
[1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:28.720]  actually people think i'm 55 years old
[1:45:28.720 --> 1:45:32.320]  and i was already taking your other supplements but i thought you know
[1:45:32.320 --> 1:45:35.440]  well maybe that's what i need to do because i just thought it was a
[1:45:35.440 --> 1:45:38.160]  hopeless situation but when i started taking it
[1:45:38.160 --> 1:45:42.560]  i mean it doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period of time i started
[1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:46.640]  noticing okay you know this is a ticket this is working this is
[1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:50.000]  wonderful you know i don't i don't have to put on
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:54.800]  derma blend anymore you know so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really
[1:45:54.800 --> 1:45:58.640]  has totally cleared up my skin
[1:46:00.800 --> 1:46:08.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:46:08.640 --> 1:46:26.560]  a couple more phone calls we're going to take here let me
[1:46:26.560 --> 1:46:30.720]  cover a couple headlines a couple stories before we do
[1:46:30.720 --> 1:46:34.720]  yes new evidence coming out of georgia as if we don't have enough the election
[1:46:34.720 --> 1:46:37.600]  was totally stolen from donald trump just outrageous
[1:46:37.600 --> 1:46:42.000]  the theft election worker ralph jones is now caught
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:45.760]  double counting ballots at the state farm center on election night and so now
[1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:49.760]  the gateway pundit has identified three democrat operatives that were double
[1:46:49.760 --> 1:46:52.720]  counting ballots and we have the tape of them doing it
[1:46:52.720 --> 1:46:56.000]  and there is also sworn affidavit testimony that
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:47:00.080]  they saw people double counting ballots so that's what they did they cheated
[1:47:00.080 --> 1:47:04.320]  donald trump won he got at least 320 in what electoral college
[1:47:04.320 --> 1:47:07.760]  so you want to know what real voter suppression is it's cheating to win
[1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:11.280]  elections that's all democrats do and then they have these events like in
[1:47:11.280 --> 1:47:15.920]  austin today at the capital with betta o roark
[1:47:15.920 --> 1:47:19.840]  and they say we're going to stop voter suppression really what about 20 million
[1:47:19.840 --> 1:47:24.560]  uh new record of number of votes in the 2020 election 20 million how do you
[1:47:24.560 --> 1:47:29.520]  explain that if it's voter suppression you can't you're a liar
[1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:32.560]  and then you've got george floyd statue is going in
[1:47:32.560 --> 1:47:35.760]  across the country you've got them in minneapolis
[1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:39.200]  and you've got them in brooklyn and the one in brooklyn well this is quite
[1:47:39.200 --> 1:47:44.160]  ironic it's a 3d printed statue of a six foot tall george
[1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:49.520]  floyd head and the problem is it's white
[1:47:51.040 --> 1:47:55.520]  huh i'm pretty sure they have uh
[1:47:55.520 --> 1:48:02.320]  non-white 3d printing colors and coloring you know
[1:48:02.320 --> 1:48:04.400]  you could have probably had the right skin
[1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:10.320]  pigmentation uh for the six foot tall george floyd head
[1:48:10.320 --> 1:48:14.320]  but hey i mean the career criminal he's a hero now
[1:48:14.320 --> 1:48:22.400]  because he uh became a media darling and a inciter his will was destroyed you
[1:48:22.400 --> 1:48:25.040]  know you know nobody really ever talks about it but
[1:48:25.040 --> 1:48:28.720]  i wonder george floyd would have liked all this stuff that's been done in his
[1:48:28.720 --> 1:48:34.160]  name since he's been deceased like starting race wars and burning
[1:48:34.160 --> 1:48:37.040]  cities to the ground you know if he was this gentle giant
[1:48:37.040 --> 1:48:40.880]  you know lover of all things like they explain i don't think he would really
[1:48:40.880 --> 1:48:44.800]  like what's followed since his death uh you know the violence and the
[1:48:44.800 --> 1:48:47.360]  destruction and the hatred and the crime and everything
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:53.280]  so uh yeah like uh shootings break out at juneteenth celebrations across the
[1:48:53.280 --> 1:48:57.280]  country because it's it's it's been stolen from us so
[1:48:57.280 --> 1:49:00.560]  so juneteenth is no longer an american holiday
[1:49:00.560 --> 1:49:03.840]  where we celebrate the fact that we freed the slaves and we set an example
[1:49:03.840 --> 1:49:07.760]  worldwide that makes slavery illegal no now the left has stolen it from us
[1:49:07.760 --> 1:49:13.680]  and it's just another leftist event for them to just go out and riot
[1:49:14.640 --> 1:49:19.040]  that's what juneteenth is now fed reverse repos
[1:49:19.040 --> 1:49:24.560]  surged to record 756 billion after rate tweak now i'm not the best person to
[1:49:24.560 --> 1:49:27.120]  cover this up i've i've read a bunch of different stories on this and i
[1:49:27.120 --> 1:49:30.240]  still don't fully get it so let me just boil it down to you like this
[1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:34.800]  the fed has more cash on hand right now than it's ever had before
[1:49:34.800 --> 1:49:38.400]  okay so i think that's really all you need to know about that
[1:49:38.400 --> 1:49:42.480]  actually hosted a deep dive into unemployment fraud
[1:49:42.480 --> 1:49:46.080]  and what did they find hundreds of millions
[1:49:46.080 --> 1:49:50.400]  hundreds of millions in unemployment fraud wow what do you know
[1:49:50.400 --> 1:49:57.520]  taxpayer dollars being stolen hand over fist all day all night
[1:49:57.520 --> 1:50:01.520]  but hey let's keep taxing us let's keep all this spending
[1:50:01.520 --> 1:50:05.920]  if the government has enough money to spend hundreds of billions of dollars
[1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:10.640]  trillions of dollars on foreign countries then they shouldn't be taxing us
[1:50:10.640 --> 1:50:15.520]  okay let's go back out to the phone lines here
[1:50:15.520 --> 1:50:21.280]  let's go to mark calling in from new york mark you're on the air go ahead
[1:50:21.280 --> 1:50:26.160]  oh this is me and this is me

[1:51:56.560 --> 1:52:00.080]  yes loud and clear excellent uh first of all
[1:52:00.080 --> 1:52:04.880]  on dean's point epstein also taught at the doton school that the doton prep
[1:52:04.880 --> 1:52:08.640]  school which was run by the bar family as an
[1:52:08.640 --> 1:52:12.240]  attorney bill bar yeah that's right so that's one thing there
[1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:15.760]  also um the news that the new zealand herald
[1:52:15.760 --> 1:52:19.680]  put out the article you read about the the birth rate dropping
[1:52:19.680 --> 1:52:24.960]  on the 11th of june of this year also this is what i really want to tell you
[1:52:24.960 --> 1:52:28.880]  a friend of mine got a screen capture of
[1:52:28.880 --> 1:52:32.560]  conversation there's no names involved but within an insurance company and a
[1:52:32.560 --> 1:52:35.920]  client and it uh it says uh the woman asked
[1:52:35.920 --> 1:52:40.400]  post vaccination if i fly somewhere and have a blood clot
[1:52:40.400 --> 1:52:45.040]  um following the trip would i be covered and the response was from the
[1:52:45.040 --> 1:52:48.160]  insurance company we would look at look to cover the
[1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:52.080]  diagnostic testing but if symptoms are related to the vaccination
[1:52:52.080 --> 1:52:57.200]  then your coverage would stop so so you don't even get healthcare coverage if
[1:52:57.200 --> 1:52:59.440]  it's caused by the vaccine is that what you're saying
[1:52:59.440 --> 1:53:02.320]  that's what this is that that's what i'm gathering from this i mean i'm going to
[1:53:02.320 --> 1:53:08.080]  email both of both of you see that that that's one of two things that's either
[1:53:08.080 --> 1:53:11.600]  just eugenics just out in the public it just out in the open
[1:53:11.600 --> 1:53:16.320]  which okay or that's their way of of using that as a cover
[1:53:16.320 --> 1:53:19.200]  to say oh see there are no vaccine side effects
[1:53:19.200 --> 1:53:22.080]  just simply because there's none on record because they won't they won't count
[1:53:22.080 --> 1:53:24.880]  it they won't cover it i say one more thing
[1:53:24.880 --> 1:53:29.520]  yeah sure um in the last year and a half being locked down in this
[1:53:29.520 --> 1:53:34.080]  hellhole that is socialist state of new jersey with a pedophile for a governor
[1:53:34.080 --> 1:53:39.360]  um i've really turned back to the bible and uh hosea
[1:53:39.360 --> 1:53:43.360]  four six really means something my people perish
[1:53:43.360 --> 1:53:47.120]  for want of knowledge since you have rejected knowledge i will reject you
[1:53:47.120 --> 1:53:50.640]  from like priesthood and since you have ignored the
[1:53:50.640 --> 1:53:55.120]  law of your god i will ignore your children
[1:53:55.120 --> 1:53:58.240]  this is what's going on sir we are in trouble
[1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:01.840]  and we really need to turn our eyes to the lord and hopefully
[1:54:01.840 --> 1:54:05.760]  we can stop whatever this is yeah well let me just tell you i mean
[1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:12.000]  yeah and thank you so much for the call i i mean my friends my family you know
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:15.520]  and mostly with friends though i mean they they know i'm the most politically
[1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:18.960]  informed person they know and they know i'm obsessed with this stuff and and
[1:54:18.960 --> 1:54:22.160]  they may not even necessarily be political and so this is kind of just
[1:54:22.160 --> 1:54:26.960]  another one of those gauge things and i'm getting more
[1:54:26.960 --> 1:54:30.640]  feedback if you will it's not really feedback but i mean i guess just me
[1:54:30.640 --> 1:54:33.840]  talking about it all the time and they know that i host a show
[1:54:33.840 --> 1:54:36.880]  and so i'm getting more feedback about this vaccine
[1:54:36.880 --> 1:54:41.200]  and about the people becoming magnetized than i have about anything
[1:54:41.200 --> 1:54:44.800]  and these are just from just the average people again may not even be political
[1:54:44.800 --> 1:54:49.120]  maybe apolitical maybe left maybe right just that they it's like this vaccine is
[1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:52.480]  really they're being bullied into taking it they're seeing the side effects
[1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:56.400]  they're seeing meat become magnetic they're seeing their friends become
[1:54:56.400 --> 1:55:00.080]  magnetic and so they just send me this stuff and like what's going on
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:03.360]  it's like well how do i explain that in a text message
[1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:09.920]  but so yeah this whole vaccine thing is really opening people's eyes and maybe
[1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:13.760]  getting them to finally question the reality of it all let's go one more
[1:55:13.760 --> 1:55:19.440]  final caller here ian in utah ian you're on the air go ahead
[1:55:19.440 --> 1:55:23.120]  hey elwin howdy remember me from barton springs
[1:55:23.120 --> 1:55:27.280]  last year i was the guy that drove about 20
[1:55:27.280 --> 1:55:34.000]  hours and did some weird dives off the platforms oh okay you mean when we hop
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:39.200]  the fence yep ah yes yeah we should you know i was
[1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:42.960]  thinking about this i don't know we're so it's just
[1:55:42.960 --> 1:55:45.920]  any any it's just like adding more stuff for our play but i was thinking we
[1:55:45.920 --> 1:55:49.440]  should do another event this summer and just get a bunch of info with people
[1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:52.080]  whether it's at barton creek or somewhere else here in austin
[1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:55.360]  uh but uh things are just so crazy right now i don't know if we'll be able to do
[1:55:55.360 --> 1:55:58.080]  it but yeah that was fun last year doing those events
[1:55:58.080 --> 1:56:01.760]  oh yeah i think that should be an annual thing for the info wars
[1:56:01.760 --> 1:56:06.400]  fans and everything but on to my topic now i'm just
[1:56:06.400 --> 1:56:09.680]  i just really think that one of the best ways that we can counter this whole
[1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:14.400]  great recent everything is actually going back to our old ways which is just
[1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:17.920]  being pioneers and founding new towns and cities and all that
[1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:21.920]  yep just rejecting all this modernity and you know here's the only problem with
[1:56:21.920 --> 1:56:24.080]  that because you're you're definitely right and we've been talking about that
[1:56:24.080 --> 1:56:26.800]  the problem is
[1:56:26.800 --> 1:56:31.040]  the the central banks control everything and you know they'll try to
[1:56:31.040 --> 1:56:35.120]  not allow you to you'd have to have big investors and and you know
[1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:37.680]  developers that are willing to do something like that that are patriots
[1:56:37.680 --> 1:56:41.120]  and like-minded all right that does it for the alex jones on this sunday but
