[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  We're not coming for your guns, lies.
[00:09.000 --> 00:16.000]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government.
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  Leading a frontal assault.
[00:18.000 --> 00:19.000]  That was 9-11.
[00:19.000 --> 00:22.000]  Of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:22.000 --> 00:26.000]  Do you still think that Jet fuel brought down a World Trade Center?
[00:26.000 --> 00:31.000]  Does anybody else see a problem here?
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  If the government has nothing to hide, why are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
[00:36.000 --> 00:40.000]  This story does not add up.
[00:40.000 --> 00:45.000]  We're on a mission that you'll never forget.
[00:45.000 --> 00:48.000]  We're never going to stop.
[00:48.000 --> 00:55.000]  And as global government gets more naked out in the open, our credibility will only go up.
[00:55.000 --> 01:00.000]  So never forget, for all those that were killed on 9-11 by the globalist,
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.000]  for the thousands being raped and murdered and killed in Europe by the Islamic invasion,
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  and for all those killed with deadly vaccines and by abortion,
[01:10.000 --> 01:13.000]  and by all those killed by radical Islam funded by the West,
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  from Tunisia to Egypt to Syria,
[01:17.000 --> 01:19.000]  we're on a mission that you'll never forget.
[01:19.000 --> 01:26.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. Thank you so much for joining us on this worldwide Sunday,
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  4-6 p.m. Central Time Transmission.
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  It is the 18th day of October, 2015.
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.000]  To show you how mega conditioned I've got,
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.000]  but to tell you how shameful I am,
[01:41.000 --> 01:48.000]  and I only do this self-deprecation so that people can look in the mirror and see what you've become,
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  because I know if it's affecting me,
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  it's affecting even the strongest of you out there in many cases.
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.000]  Some of you have stronger resolve than I am and get more steadfast.
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.000]  But I've got three different CNN clips.
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.000]  I've got MSNBC, I've got MPR, I've got countless local stations,
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  I've got the gun control groups,
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.000]  and now I've got Hillary Clinton,
[02:14.000 --> 02:21.000]  all saying they plan nationwide gun confiscation and forced buybacks.
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  And I knew they were coming with this by their own leaks,
[02:25.000 --> 02:27.000]  but also our high-level insiders in D.C.
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  have all been on the last six months saying the assault is coming.
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.000]  Prepare yourself. It'll be in 2016.
[02:35.000 --> 02:41.000]  They're going to try to actually make you hand in many types of semi-auto.
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.000]  And I was told this by congressmen.
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  I was told this on air by people like Professor Lott.
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  I was told this by insiders on the NRA board.
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  We've been told this via drudge by Supreme Court justice.
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000]  They're coming.
[03:00.000 --> 03:03.000]  This is it. This is the biggest assault, the biggest ever.
[03:03.000 --> 03:11.000]  This is their battle of the bulge, folks, throwing everything they've got at us.
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.000]  And so get ready.
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  Kit Daniels had written an article about it by the fourth hour,
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  or the end of the third hour of Friday.
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.000]  I didn't even cover it.
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.000]  That's how focused I was on them announcing globalization,
[03:28.000 --> 03:33.000]  police, federalization, UN training, special new anti-patriot units
[03:33.000 --> 03:36.000]  in the Justice Department outside of the FBI.
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  I was so busy focused on that and a bunch of other issues that,
[03:39.000 --> 03:44.000]  oh, Hillary says she wants gun confiscation, basically Australian style,
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  that they're looking at that.
[03:46.000 --> 03:49.000]  It didn't even register enough when it was like a 10 on a record scale
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.000]  for me to cover it until I looked back on it.
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  And it's that normalization of the tyranny.
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.000]  It's that conditioning where even those of us that are fully awake
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  become comfortable with the death of our freedoms
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  and probably even our physical deaths in FEMA camps.
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  Because as sensational as that is, they admit they're gearing that up.
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  So we don't need to get so comfortable with this
[04:18.000 --> 04:21.000]  and so unknowledgeable that we forget we're in a fight with it.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  And I know you know that I'm talking to myself most importantly.
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  There's a reason they're announcing world government.
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  There's a reason they're announcing our children don't belong to us.
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  There's a reason they're announcing forced inoculations and totally open borders.
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.000]  There's a reason they're announcing the CIA's involved in domestic operations
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  to deceive the American people.
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  The Washington Post endorses it as a good idea
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  because we've exposed them so they're going from denial
[04:50.000 --> 04:56.000]  to just out of the open confidence game, flaunting it and normalization.
[04:56.000 --> 04:58.000]  And that means the next shoe is about to drop.
[04:58.000 --> 05:02.000]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built up toxins
[05:02.000 --> 05:04.000]  and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[05:04.000 --> 05:07.000]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.000]  to take tried and true herbs and other compounds
[05:10.000 --> 05:12.000]  known to safely cleanse the liver
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.000]  and fuse it with the latest research and technological development
[05:15.000 --> 05:19.000]  on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.000]  The liver shield is the only liver support product in the market
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.000]  that uses a patented spy G-Rex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.000]  And when you visit infoworslife.com
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.000]  see the instructional video on how to do a six day liver detox.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  This isn't a game and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.000]  Liver shield is totally organic and made of the safest high quality herbs.
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.000]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.000]  Liver shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.

[06:25.000 --> 06:29.000]  Smoke on the water, fire in the skies.
[06:29.000 --> 06:34.000]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen to this worldwide original live broadcast.
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.000]  It is four o'clock and six minutes here central time.
[06:37.000 --> 06:41.000]  Many stations re-air this at different times across the United States
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.000]  and many of you of course are listening via the internet,
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.000]  global shortwave satellites and other means across and around the globe.
[06:49.000 --> 06:54.000]  It is Sunday the 18th day of October 2015.
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones. We'll be here for the next two hours
[06:57.000 --> 07:00.000]  and then we shall return tomorrow.
[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  As long as there's still a First Amendment that is in peril.
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.000]  11 a.m. to 2 p.m. now 3 p.m.
[07:06.000 --> 07:12.000]  We've had an hour central time with the daytime radio slash TV broadcast
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  and then of course weeknights, 7 o'clock central,
[07:15.000 --> 07:19.000]  info wars, nightly news, fine details, free podcasts,
[07:19.000 --> 07:24.000]  droid apps, iPhone apps, audio, video streams and more
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.000]  at infowars.com forward slash show.
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  And please send that link to friends, family, neighbors
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  and every other contact you come in contact with
[07:34.000 --> 07:41.000]  if you want to defeat the globalist which is in our grasp to do.
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  Here's what we're covering today ladies and gentlemen.
[07:44.000 --> 07:48.000]  Hillary Clinton came out last Thursday
[07:48.000 --> 07:56.000]  on C-SPAN. We covered it on Friday and I saw very little coverage of it
[07:56.000 --> 08:03.000]  in the media over the weekend which shows you how conditioned we've got,
[08:03.000 --> 08:11.000]  how conditioned we've become to just abject super naked tyranny.
[08:11.000 --> 08:16.000]  They are calling for congressional legislation to tax and restrict AMO.
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.000]  They are calling on import-export bans.
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.000]  They are calling on banning gun shows basically and private transfers of firearms
[08:23.000 --> 08:28.000]  to friends and family but most importantly and draconian.
[08:28.000 --> 08:32.000]  One of the most draconian statements we've ever heard out of anyone
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  in the Democratic or Republican party.
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  It's worse than Diane Feinstein saying if she had the votes,
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.000]  in the Senate she would ban every one of them, every firearm
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  and make Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in.
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.000]  And we're going to play that clip later today.
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  We're going to play the clip on clips from Katrina where they said
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.000]  all your guns will be taken, no one will be allowed to have firearms.
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  The same thing is done when they have a flood in Canada.
[09:00.000 --> 09:04.000]  They don't come save you, they come and take your guns and never give them back.
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  But none of these clips, none of these announcements are anything
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  compared to Hillary Clinton on C-SPAN.
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  The story is the top story on infowars.com.
[09:16.000 --> 09:20.000]  From Friday, I've had it move back to the front page, it's red linked,
[09:20.000 --> 09:26.000]  it's Kit Daniels, Hillary Clinton, nationwide gun ban,
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.000]  repeal of Second Amendment worth considering.
[09:31.000 --> 09:32.000]  That's a quote.
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  Now why is that so important?
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  We're going to play it in a moment.
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  Because the Violence Policy Center, Handgun Control,
[09:39.000 --> 09:44.000]  Incorporated, the Bloomberg Funded Foundation and others
[09:44.000 --> 09:52.000]  are all pushing that it's reasonable to have Australian-style gun confiscation.
[09:52.000 --> 09:58.000]  Obama has said three weeks ago that we could look at the types of things
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.000]  that Australia did.
[10:01.000 --> 10:04.000]  I'm going to tell my crew tomorrow what's going to happen.
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  We're going to string all these new clips together because
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.000]  I realize we've hit a cognitive dissonance or a kind of fatigue
[10:11.000 --> 10:12.000]  with this tyranny.
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.000]  We're now just over the top announcements are made.
[10:16.000 --> 10:19.000]  I don't even covered it myself.
[10:19.000 --> 10:24.000]  Obama, two and a half, three weeks ago, said we should look at what Australia did.
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  Hillary's now said it.
[10:26.000 --> 10:29.000]  They're now moving with a bunch of legislation.
[10:29.000 --> 10:32.000]  And they're announcing the really bad stuff's coming next year.
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000]  There it is, Obama goes beyond mere gun control, hints at confiscation.
[10:37.000 --> 10:43.000]  Breitbart, Australian Great Britain are mentioned
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000]  and they're virtually complete bands on firearms possession.
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.000]  That was back on October 3rd, so two weeks ago.
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.000]  As you can see, they're moving.
[10:55.000 --> 10:56.000]  And they mean business.
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  People say, oh, they'll never get away with that.
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  That would cause a civil war.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  People would fight back.
[11:02.000 --> 11:03.000]  That's the plan.
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000]  They're seriously considering what they've done in countless other third world countries
[11:08.000 --> 11:18.000]  and first world nations, creating civil unrest with unpopular unconstitutional draconian actions.
[11:18.000 --> 11:27.000]  George Soros alone spent $33 million in Ferguson, Missouri to finance riots in the local town
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.000]  and to scapegoat the police for all of America's problems.
[11:30.000 --> 11:36.000]  And then to finance organizations and groups calling for the murder of police.
[11:36.000 --> 11:42.000]  And folks know I have big problems with the training of police, militarization, globalization, federalization,
[11:42.000 --> 11:52.000]  but to have MSNBC, CNN, Anderson Cooper and others connected like Al Sharpton directly to the White House
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.000]  saying the plan is to federalize police.
[11:55.000 --> 12:03.000]  The plan is to project onto them racism in America and have a weird class war,
[12:03.000 --> 12:08.000]  a weird limited red terror on the police alone.
[12:08.000 --> 12:13.000]  That's meant to make them capitulate to the globalist and roll over and do whatever they're told
[12:13.000 --> 12:21.000]  and accept this new UN Safe Cities Justice Department initiative to become basically communist,
[12:21.000 --> 12:28.000]  anti-patriot, anti-gun, anti-veteran, anti-conservative community activist.
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  That's what this is.
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.000]  And so it's like people, you know, beating up on a 12 year old saying you better join our gang
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  or we'll break your nose.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  That's basically what's going on to local government right now.
[12:42.000 --> 12:47.000]  And if we don't recognize it for what it is, the globalist may be successful.
[12:47.000 --> 12:52.000]  So that story is up on infowars.com right now.
[12:52.000 --> 12:57.000]  I suggest you get it out to everyone you know that you put it on Facebook, Twitter, that you email it,
[12:57.000 --> 13:03.000]  that you aggressively send it to your police departments and say, see, we told you this is coming.
[13:03.000 --> 13:10.000]  I saw three prominent sheriffs just last week come out and say we will not be part of gun confiscation under executive orders.
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.000]  And why are they having to say that?
[13:13.000 --> 13:20.000]  Because two weeks ago Obama gave a speech and it was in the Washington Post with the quote,
[13:20.000 --> 13:32.000]  Obama to circumvent Congress with gun control agenda and to take executive action in the circumvention of law.
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  Remember what Obama said on the open borders?
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  He was speaking to La Raza.
[13:36.000 --> 13:39.000]  He said, I changed the law.
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  He didn't even sign an executive order.
[13:41.000 --> 13:50.000]  He ordered the border patrol to start giving vouchers to illegals and busing them into democratic handlers.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  So this is where it's all going.
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  That's our number one story then.
[13:56.000 --> 14:02.000]  Starting at the bottom of the hour, we're going to start profiling globalist.
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.000]  We're going to start profiling from my research who I believe is at the very top of the new world water power structure.
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  We're going to look at the owners of the global government.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  There's very few of those, the big top owners.
[14:14.000 --> 14:20.000]  Then we're also going to look at the top managers who themselves are billionaires.
[14:20.000 --> 14:30.000]  We're going to look at Peter Sutherland today, the former head of Goldman Sachs Europe, the former head of BP worldwide.
[14:30.000 --> 14:41.000]  The man who told the BBC, quote, EU should undermine national homogeneity says and use migration.
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  This is the guy engineering the radical Islamic influx right now.
[14:45.000 --> 14:51.000]  We're going to look in to why he's doing this and what the end game is to understand who these people are.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  And he looks like a James Bond villain.
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  But it's not his looks, it's his actions.
[14:57.000 --> 15:05.000]  Let's go to Hillary Clinton in a town hall just three days ago saying we're coming for your guns and we're looking at what Australia did.
[15:05.000 --> 15:06.000]  Here it is.
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  You know, Australia is a good example.
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  Canada is a good example.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  The UK is a good example.
[15:12.000 --> 15:13.000]  Why?
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  Because each of them had mass killings.
[15:15.000 --> 15:20.000]  Australia had a huge mass killing about 25, 20, 25 years ago.
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  Canada did as well.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  So did the UK.
[15:24.000 --> 15:30.000]  And in reaction, they passed much stricter gun laws.
[15:30.000 --> 15:37.000]  In the Australian example, as I recall, that was a buyback program.
[15:37.000 --> 15:44.000]  The Australian government, as part of trying to clamp down on the availability of automatic weapons,
[15:44.000 --> 15:49.000]  offered a good price for buying hundreds of thousands of guns.
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.000]  And then they basically clamped down going forward in terms of having, you know, more...
[15:54.000 --> 16:20.000]  We'll be back with their plan to take the guns. There's more.
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  888-253-3-1-3-9.
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  888-253-3-9.
[17:54.000 --> 17:57.000]  888-253-3-1-3-9.
[18:25.000 --> 18:28.000]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X-2 for yourselves.
[18:28.000 --> 18:29.000]  What do you have to lose?
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.000]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty,
[18:32.000 --> 18:38.000]  and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[18:38.000 --> 18:41.000]  And the final reason to try X-2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.000]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago, and that is about to sell out.
[18:45.000 --> 18:48.000]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[18:48.000 --> 18:54.000]  We'll challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X-2 today at infowarslife.com,
[18:54.000 --> 18:58.000]  or by calling 888-253-3-1-3-9.
[18:58.000 --> 19:08.000]  Most of the InfoWars radio-listening audience is aware of the high quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at HDFirearms.com.
[19:08.000 --> 19:14.000]  One of the most exciting things about HDFirearms.com is the ability to upgrade your AR-15 platform today.
[19:14.000 --> 19:20.000]  They call it their low profile platform, PVX muzzle brakes, proven to help control muzzle rise.
[19:20.000 --> 19:29.000]  6061 billet material with type 3 hard coating, bolt carrier group for 308 and 556 ARs, custom kydex holsters.
[19:29.000 --> 19:34.000]  Ideal for concealed carry with.080 thick kydex to ensure durability.
[19:34.000 --> 19:37.000]  Most competitors' material use.060.
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.000]  Configure yours today at HDFirearms.com.
[19:40.000 --> 19:45.000]  In my favorite, single stage trigger, a home run upgrade for your AR-15 and AR-10 platforms.
[19:45.000 --> 19:52.000]  Find out more at HDFirearms.com today, or call 770-485-7015.
[19:52.000 --> 20:11.000]  That's HDFirearms.com, or call 770-485-7015.
[20:11.000 --> 20:31.000]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GZN radio network.
[20:31.000 --> 20:42.000]  Reflecting on the death of America. Because our republic doesn't have much time.
[20:42.000 --> 20:49.000]  Because the Pope and other world leaders have openly called for world government.
[20:49.000 --> 20:58.000]  And the end of individual liberty. Nations themselves will have no rights or standing.
[20:58.000 --> 21:04.000]  The globalists that run this planetary regime are eugenicists.
[21:04.000 --> 21:09.000]  And what I'm going to do is get to Peter Sutherland and that profile of him at 45 after today.
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  Because I want to continue on the attack on the right to keep their arms.
[21:12.000 --> 21:21.000]  Then in the second hour, we will open the phones up and cover much of the other news around the world.
[21:21.000 --> 21:27.000]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to play just a four minute compilation of Obama and others.
[21:27.000 --> 21:32.000]  They're coming to take your guns. Of course, we have them during the first campaign.
[21:32.000 --> 21:38.000]  And even the second campaign saying, we never said we want your guns. No one wants your guns.
[21:38.000 --> 21:45.000]  But I want to play this Hillary clip. And then I want to stop it and start it and go over the deception.
[21:45.000 --> 21:51.000]  This is her just a few days ago, echoing the new talking point of we can do what Australia did.
[21:51.000 --> 21:55.000]  It's real reasonable. It's no big deal.
[21:55.000 --> 22:00.000]  Yeah, they did it incrementally. First, they bought your gun back because they were banned.
[22:00.000 --> 22:06.000]  All semi-autos, basically. But then she lies and calls it full auto.
[22:06.000 --> 22:11.000]  So it's lie after lie after lie. So she implies it's no big deal.
[22:11.000 --> 22:15.000]  There was a buyback and then if you didn't turn them in, there was a crackdown.
[22:15.000 --> 22:19.000]  That's right. They swat team and killed a lot of people.
[22:19.000 --> 22:27.000]  And still, that didn't work. So most Australians didn't even turn their guns in and they ignore the law in many areas.
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.000]  But still, it's killing the gun culture because you can't get the ammo in many cases.
[22:31.000 --> 22:35.000]  You can't openly train folks how to use the guns.
[22:35.000 --> 22:41.000]  All that's allowed is single shot, shotguns and rifles in rural areas.
[22:41.000 --> 22:47.000]  And by the way, Australia's crime rate since that happened 24 years ago, as well as New Zealand's.
[22:47.000 --> 22:54.000]  Look it up, has only gone up. England, after they banned guns 30 years ago, has seen a tripling.
[22:54.000 --> 23:00.000]  Look it up in violent crime. It's true. It is an island. They can keep even snakes and rabies out.
[23:00.000 --> 23:06.000]  There are no snakes. There is no rabies. The UK really is able to keep a lot of stuff out.
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.000]  Not the illegal aliens, not the gypsies, not all the robbery, not the drugs because they want that in.
[23:11.000 --> 23:19.000]  They are able to keep a lot of guns and things like that out. So shabbings, people having their brains beat out with baseball bats.
[23:19.000 --> 23:24.000]  It's three times the overall crime rate.
[23:24.000 --> 23:32.000]  How gun control made England the most violent country in Europe. Search that and you'll get NRA, Breitbart, Info Wars.
[23:32.000 --> 23:39.000]  But it's the same statistics where you can link through and it's admitted.
[23:39.000 --> 23:46.000]  Who has the lowest crime rate in the world? Hands down. Look it up.
[23:46.000 --> 23:57.000]  It's in between Italy, Austria, France and one other country. Who could it be?
[23:57.000 --> 24:04.000]  Alex Rebek asked the question. He played the Jeopardy music. Who is Switzerland or what is Switzerland?
[24:04.000 --> 24:11.000]  Never watch Jeopardy. What's the proper way of saying it? What is Switzerland?
[24:11.000 --> 24:19.000]  Lowest crime rate in the world. Who has the highest crime rate in the world for violent crime?
[24:19.000 --> 24:27.000]  What is Mexico? And which country in North America has the most strict gun control laws?
[24:27.000 --> 24:36.000]  What is Mexico? What city in the United States has the highest crime rate? What is Chicago?
[24:36.000 --> 24:42.000]  What city in North America has the highest crime rate even beating out Mexico as a country?
[24:42.000 --> 24:50.000]  What is Chicago? And of course we is informed classical Jeffersonian liberals who really are for diversity,
[24:50.000 --> 24:57.000]  who really are for tolerance, who really are for self-defense, who really are for women's rights.
[24:57.000 --> 25:05.000]  We're informed to know the facts. You want to get mugged, go walk out around 10 o'clock at night in London.
[25:05.000 --> 25:16.000]  Go to Chicago, Southside. Excuse me. Go to Maryland in places like Baltimore. Go to D.C.
[25:16.000 --> 25:24.000]  But see, they don't care. They don't care if it's unconstitutional. They don't care if we say no.
[25:24.000 --> 25:32.000]  Six years ago Congress voted to not turn in and not turn over our power plants.
[25:32.000 --> 25:37.000]  So Obama just shut them down with executive orders and left his buddies and General Electric open.
[25:37.000 --> 25:43.000]  They want the civil unrest. They want to be able to persecute gun owners when you don't turn them in and fight back.
[25:43.000 --> 25:49.000]  They don't care if cops and military and BATF get killed coming to take them. They love that.
[25:49.000 --> 25:55.000]  It's more dead Americans. They love a civil war. And this is their big move. They've been gearing up for it.
[25:55.000 --> 26:03.000]  Don't think they won't pull an executive action to take the guns. We are one inch away from it.
[26:03.000 --> 26:09.000]  Let's start playing the disgusting Hillary clip. It wasn't fully autos that were killing people in Australia.
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  Full autos are a special stamp there and here.
[26:13.000 --> 26:19.000]  Full autos are used almost in no crime. It's less than one-tenth of one percent.
[26:19.000 --> 26:23.000]  50 caliber rifles have been around since the 40s in public use.
[26:23.000 --> 26:31.000]  There's been one crime committed with a 50 caliber rifle in U.S. history, an armored truck robbery.
[26:31.000 --> 26:35.000]  Assault rifles are used total in less than two percent.
[26:35.000 --> 26:42.000]  Full auto assault rifles less than one-tenth of one percent. But every time they go on TV, they say there are people with automatic machine guns
[26:42.000 --> 26:50.000]  killing everyone, talking to their mindless, sheep-like constituents who want the government to have guns.
[26:50.000 --> 26:57.000]  They love black uniforms. They just don't want other slaves having it because they're a parasite class.
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.000]  So here she is acting like it's very reasonable what Australia did and we can do it here.
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.000]  Yeah, forced buyback and confiscation of everything but single shot. Here it is.
[27:08.000 --> 27:15.000]  You know, Australia is a good example. Canada is a good example. The UK is a good example. Why?
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  Because each of them had mass killings.
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.000]  Canada had a huge mass killing about 25, 25 years ago.
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.000]  Canada did as well. So did the UK.
[27:27.000 --> 27:33.000]  And in reaction, they passed much stricter gun laws.
[27:33.000 --> 27:39.000]  In the Australian example, as I recall, that was a buyback program.
[27:39.000 --> 27:46.000]  The Australian government as part of trying to clamp down on the availability of automatic weapons,
[27:46.000 --> 27:51.000]  offered a good price for buying hundreds of thousands of guns.
[27:51.000 --> 27:58.000]  And then they basically clamped down going forward in terms of having more of a background check approach,
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  more of a permitting approach.
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.000]  No, they banned them.
[28:01.000 --> 28:08.000]  But they believed, and I think the evidence supports them, that by offering to buyback those guns,
[28:08.000 --> 28:19.000]  they were able to curtail the supply and to set a different standard for gun purchases in the future.
[28:19.000 --> 28:25.000]  And the real Crocodile Dundee, he looked this up in NRA magazine from about 16 years ago.
[28:25.000 --> 28:31.000]  He wouldn't turn in. He has five shot deer rifle that his dad had given him.
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.000]  And they came to his house and gunned him down. They murdered him.
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.000]  The real Crocodile Dundee looks just like the guy from the movie that was based on a real guy.
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  They murdered him. No criminal record.
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.000]  He lived way out in the countryside. They came to his house and gunned him down.
[28:43.000 --> 28:46.000]  As he was dying, he shot three of the cops, though, the gun confiscators.
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  So that's how that's going to go, just so you know.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  Infowars.com, PresidentPlanet.com are the websites.
[28:52.000 --> 28:57.000]  They're coming for our guns, folks, or the last countries they haven't gotten.
[28:57.000 --> 29:03.000]  Indiana Sheriff Brad Rogers made his stance on the Second Amendment clear during a recent interview.
[29:03.000 --> 29:14.000]  If President Obama today said, I'm creating an executive order that all sheriffs and police chiefs around this nation need to start registering firearms, I will disregard it.
[29:14.000 --> 29:20.000]  Presidential candidate Jim Webb defended the Second Amendment rights of Americans during the first Democratic debate,
[29:20.000 --> 29:24.000]  and he actually called out his fellow politicians on their hypocrisy.
[29:24.000 --> 29:32.000]  There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
[29:32.000 --> 29:37.000]  The average American does not have that and deserves the right to be able to protect their family.
[29:37.000 --> 29:42.000]  And Webb's point echoes recent comments made by media pioneer Matt Drudge.
[29:42.000 --> 29:46.000]  Challenge Hillary, take away your secret service, dismiss them.
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  I dare you, Obama, same thing.
[29:48.000 --> 29:50.000]  Leave the White House unguarded, Obama.
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  You know what would happen in 30 seconds?
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  Both of those people would no longer be on planet Earth.
[29:54.000 --> 29:58.000]  Read more now at Infowars.com.
[29:58.000 --> 30:02.000]  I love our candy. I love our video games.
[30:02.000 --> 30:11.000]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[30:11.000 --> 30:14.000]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[30:14.000 --> 30:18.000]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[30:18.000 --> 30:24.000]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[30:24.000 --> 30:29.000]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[30:29.000 --> 30:35.000]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[30:35.000 --> 30:43.000]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[30:43.000 --> 30:50.000]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[30:50.000 --> 30:54.000]  Obtain your Child Ease today at InfowarsLife.com.
[30:54.000 --> 30:58.000]  That's Child Ease exclusively at InfowarsLife.com.

[31:08.000 --> 31:14.000]  One of the most exciting things about HDFirearms.com is the ability to upgrade your AR-15 platform today.
[31:14.000 --> 31:20.000]  They call it their low profile platform, PVX muzzle brakes, proven to help control muzzle rise.

[31:29.000 --> 31:34.000]  Ideal for concealed carry with.080 thick kydex to ensure durability.

[31:58.000 --> 32:02.000]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[32:02.000 --> 32:10.000]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[32:10.000 --> 32:15.000]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[32:15.000 --> 32:18.000]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[32:18.000 --> 32:20.000]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[32:50.000 --> 33:15.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:15.000 --> 33:26.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:26.000 --> 33:33.000]  Well, we told you about this a long time ago and I'm going to break down why it's so important, why it's so key.
[33:33.000 --> 33:38.000]  This is happening now, what it signifies. It's a very important signpost.
[33:38.000 --> 33:47.000]  Big banks to America's firms, we don't want your cash and we're going to charge you to deposit cash with our banks.
[33:47.000 --> 33:57.000]  Now remember, the big mega banks have all been caught laundering hundreds of billions of dollars per decade, per major bank.
[33:57.000 --> 34:15.000]  In a Bloomberg investigation of all places, just Wells Fargo and Wacovia in a three-year period laundered 378 billion dollars from 2007 to 2010.
[34:15.000 --> 34:30.000]  378 billion dollars of drug money. Those two particular firms also ran and owned and then leased the jet aircraft, the large passenger jets to fly drugs and weapons on,
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.000]  but then also kidnapped people for rendition at torture sites.
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  That was back on the news on Friday.
[34:36.000 --> 34:39.000]  Washington Post about CIA torture sites around the world.
[34:39.000 --> 34:43.000]  They're not torturing radical Islamists at those.
[34:43.000 --> 34:47.000]  No, we don't really know who they're torturing, but it is organized crime.
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  Looks like it's folks that don't play ball.
[34:49.000 --> 34:59.000]  They're just getting those dark centers, those torture centers, I guess warmed up and ready with personnel that enjoy their work.
[34:59.000 --> 35:15.000]  So the personnel they hire generally federal former prison guards who were fired for sexual abuse tends to be their favorite person to dungeon keep at the ghost sites and black sites.
[35:15.000 --> 35:23.000]  And then the major defense contractors pretty much all have been found caught in human trafficking of women and children.
[35:23.000 --> 35:32.000]  That's who runs our government. The same folks that have covered it up that plan parenthoods, shelling baby parts and keeping babies alive before harvesting.
[35:32.000 --> 35:42.000]  And of course, China now admits they keep people alive when they take one kidney and then take some other organs, they keep them alive until the next person's lined up.
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  Then they take your final organs and kill you.
[35:44.000 --> 35:53.000]  This is all part of the devaluation of human life taking place and we're just here emergency transmission warning everyone.
[35:53.000 --> 36:02.000]  Now, we're going to look at the globalist and the type of people that kept in their operations the next segment.
[36:02.000 --> 36:15.000]  And next hour we've got Clinton Southern strategy. Hillary fix her accent for a local crowd and him and hard doing a southern drawl.
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.000]  But they point out it was nothing compared to her in Kentucky.
[36:19.000 --> 36:32.000]  Back in 2008 when she goes, I ain't gonna do that at all. How about you get some possums and you're you. I mean, it was worse than granny being crossed with Roscoe Pico training.
[36:32.000 --> 36:39.000]  People make fun of this. This actually works on the general public.
[36:39.000 --> 36:49.000]  But this is what a foreign occupier does. They come and try to make you feel at home, make you feel like you can trust them.
[36:49.000 --> 37:04.000]  And it tends to work on moron Democrat constituents who just want to feel like they belong and feel like they're wanted on a winning team, even though they are the chumps, smucks, suckers, the marks of this criminal combine.
[37:04.000 --> 37:17.000]  But I want to play just a short four minute clip, a few of the other clips of the former attorney general saying brainwash the public Eric Holder and Hillary saying we're coming for your guns and dying finds dying saying we're going to ban them.
[37:17.000 --> 37:23.000]  Just so you understand when they out of the other side of their mouth go, nobody wants your guns crazy man, nobody ever took guns.
[37:23.000 --> 37:29.000]  Well, you took them everywhere else in the world. You took them in a bunch of US cities. I mean, you admit you want our guns.
[37:29.000 --> 37:40.000]  Joe Biden goes nobody wants your guns. That's crazy. Two plus two equals five raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt. You didn't build your business. You can keep your doctor.
[37:40.000 --> 37:50.000]  Obamacare is free and Santa Claus is real. So let's go ahead and go to this compilation of them being a little more honest about wanting your guns. Here it is.
[37:50.000 --> 38:03.000]  Gun violence has been on a rampage as we know firsthand and we know pain. That's Cuomo. It's actually down who had been fired from his job about a year or so.
[38:03.000 --> 38:16.000]  Bloomberg began shooting near the Empire State Building but out on the street. He killed one person and at least nine other people were shot and some may have been shot accidentally by police officers.
[38:16.000 --> 38:24.000]  Because frankly, in my hometown of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s. They're using cheap handguns. And so what can we do to intervene?
[38:24.000 --> 38:34.000]  When he turned the door handle, I shot toward him with the arm's gun and hit him right here in the arm.
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.000]  After she shot guns in the shoulder, he ran out of the bathroom and threw this door.
[38:38.000 --> 38:47.000]  A comprehensive strategy, part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers.
[38:47.000 --> 38:54.000]  No crime assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. An agent pulled an Uzi submachine gun out of a briefcase.
[38:54.000 --> 39:09.000]  We joke sometimes about how Belize is getting to the age now and boys start calling and I always talk about how one of the main incentives for running again was continuing secret service protections.
[39:09.000 --> 39:12.000]  Obama's daughters have 11 on guards.
[39:12.000 --> 39:26.000]  We had no way to protect ourselves and there was anybody around to take care of us. We were our first responders. I came up with a plan and the plan has been on the news a lot. It's pretty self-explanatory.
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.000]  They have to have a CHL. We approve them.
[39:29.000 --> 39:36.000]  I guarantee you, Barack Obama ain't taking my shotguns, so don't buy that, Milwaukee. Don't buy that, Milwaukee.
[39:36.000 --> 39:37.000]  That's right. Nobody wants them.
[39:37.000 --> 39:46.000]  I'm going to start pedaling that to you. I got two. If he tries to fool my Beretta, he's got a problem. I like that a little over and under. You know, I'm not bad with it.
[39:46.000 --> 39:55.000]  The latest limousine, known as the Beast, thanks to 8-inch thick armor plating, Remington shotguns are close at hand.
[39:55.000 --> 40:06.000]  I'm the guy that originally wrote the assault weapons ban that became law and then we got defeated, then Barbara, excuse me, then Dianne Feinstein went to town on it and did a great job.
[40:06.000 --> 40:11.000]  I know the urge to arm yourself because that's what I did.
[40:11.000 --> 40:12.000]  That's a billionaire.
[40:12.000 --> 40:26.000]  I was trained in firearms. I'd walk to the hospital when my husband was sick. I carried a concealed weapon. I made the determination that if somebody was going to try to take me out, I was going to take them with me.
[40:26.000 --> 40:38.000]  California Senator Dianne Feinstein worked for more than a year to get the assault weapons bill passed in the face of ferocious opposition from the National Rifle Association. She says she got the best she could.
[40:38.000 --> 40:52.000]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in. I would have done it.
[40:52.000 --> 41:03.000]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this. It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad for Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[41:03.000 --> 41:10.000]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns and invasions.
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  And ship guns into Mexico?
[41:11.000 --> 41:22.000]  The Justice Department is basically guilty of allowing weapons to kill Americans and Mexicans. So will you agree to cooperate that investigation both on the House and Senate side?
[41:22.000 --> 41:33.000]  We'll certainly cooperate with all the investigations, but I'm going to take great exception to what you just said. The notion that somehow or other this Justice Department is responsible for those deaths that you mentioned.
[41:33.000 --> 41:34.000]  And, okay, same.
[41:34.000 --> 41:35.000]  That assertion is offensive.
[41:35.000 --> 41:36.000]  We caught you both times.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  But what if it's accurate, Mr. Attorney General?
[41:38.000 --> 41:52.000]  And that's just a small smattering of what these people are up to. I don't like getting up here risking my name, my treasure, my body, but it's got to be done because these people are evil.
[41:52.000 --> 42:03.000]  They live behind bodyguards. They live off taxpayer money. And now they're announcing that the American gun owner, the American libertarian, the American veteran, the American police officer is the enemy.
[42:03.000 --> 42:12.000]  You can see that they're using revolutionary tactics to overthrow the legitimate parts of the government and bring in their oppression.
[42:12.000 --> 42:22.000]  They've got two new Avengers and Captain America cartoons demonizing the Tea Party and saying we're all racist and that we have to be basically taken out.
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  That's in the Washington Times today.
[42:24.000 --> 42:30.000]  And the leader of the Tea Party group is me. It's my face working for Red Skull.
[42:30.000 --> 42:36.000]  I mean, that's the level of brainwashing they're involved in.
[42:36.000 --> 42:47.000]  That I work with a Nazi from imaginary comic books because I don't want our borders completely wide open by executive action that's illegal.
[42:47.000 --> 42:52.000]  When we come back, we're going to look at who pulls the shots, who's in charge.
[42:52.000 --> 42:57.000]  We're going to look at one of the main kingpins on the other side of this break. Stay with us.
[42:57.000 --> 43:03.000]  Many of the products at InfoWarsLife.com are true game changers. They are...
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.000]  Many of the products at InfoWarsLife.com are true game changers.
[43:22.000 --> 43:27.000]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[43:27.000 --> 43:34.000]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield, Nace and Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over 100 years.
[43:34.000 --> 43:45.000]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that Iodine accrued form of it be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in Iodine was causing.
[43:45.000 --> 43:48.000]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[43:48.000 --> 43:58.000]  What do you have to lose? You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[43:58.000 --> 44:05.000]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock. We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[44:05.000 --> 44:14.000]  It may be a month or two until more comes in. I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com.

[47:00.000 --> 47:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:12.000 --> 47:20.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[47:20.000 --> 47:32.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen to the Sunday Worldwide Transmission.
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[47:34.000 --> 47:41.000]  Well, I did a Facebook mentions today for about 20 minutes, breaking this down.
[47:41.000 --> 47:51.000]  The announcement that we're going to more and more start focusing in on key individuals inside this movement towards
[47:51.000 --> 47:57.000]  unelected draconian, totalitarian world government.
[47:57.000 --> 48:02.000]  And of course, listeners are welcome to recommend people they think we should focus in on.
[48:02.000 --> 48:07.000]  But we're gonna be looking from the very top down to the mid-level.
[48:07.000 --> 48:14.000]  And I wanted to start off today looking at the former head of the European Union Commission
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  that helped create the modern European Union by stealth.
[48:18.000 --> 48:24.000]  And I wanted to look at what he's up to and what he's pushing today.
[48:24.000 --> 48:30.000]  Because if you understand who these more shadowy players are who don't get as much attention,
[48:30.000 --> 48:35.000]  then you can get the public to actually focus on who they then work for.
[48:35.000 --> 48:42.000]  And we're talking about less than 20 international families.
[48:42.000 --> 48:51.000]  The grandchildren and children of the famous robber barons in Europe, the UK and the United States and Canada.
[48:51.000 --> 48:59.000]  Who are the creators of the UN, the creators of modern environmentalism, the creators of globalism.
[48:59.000 --> 49:11.000]  Who are the people that have decided with the big think tanks and the major universities how to design and build our world.
[49:11.000 --> 49:19.000]  They have not been in full control of human development since they began this project more than 100 years ago.
[49:19.000 --> 49:30.000]  But their project is an attempt to siphon off public and private funds to build a worldwide fascist,
[49:30.000 --> 49:40.000]  crony capitalist monopoly above government that has diplomatic immunity, is tax-exempt,
[49:40.000 --> 49:52.000]  and is able to then tax the general public and control the world through private central banks like the Federal Reserve that is federal in name only.
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.000]  And so first we will look at, and we'll be doing this throughout the week.
[49:57.000 --> 50:05.000]  I'll be producing a special 10-minute piece or so specifically on who they are.
[50:05.000 --> 50:15.000]  And chief amongst them in the management class at the very, very top in kind of the segue between top globalist gopher,
[50:15.000 --> 50:21.000]  top globalist imperial legate or governor and owner.
[50:21.000 --> 50:29.000]  He's worth billions of dollars, but he's still not what I'd call an original owning, ruling family.
[50:29.000 --> 50:42.000]  But he's Peter Sutherland, and here's the BBC from June 12, from June 21, 2012.
[50:42.000 --> 50:50.000]  EU should undermine national homogeneity, says UN migration chief.
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  Now he doesn't say you should undermine the homogeneity of Africa.
[50:54.000 --> 50:58.000]  He doesn't say undermine the homogeneity of India.
[50:58.000 --> 51:02.000]  He doesn't say undermine the homogeneity of China or Mexico.
[51:02.000 --> 51:08.000]  He doesn't say undermine the homogeneity of Chile.
[51:08.000 --> 51:14.000]  He doesn't say undermine the homogeneity of Saudi Arabia, who hasn't taken one refugee.
[51:14.000 --> 51:22.000]  He says undermine the fact that homogeneous just means that you go to Scotland and it's mainly Scots.
[51:22.000 --> 51:29.000]  Or you go to Mexico, it's mainly Mexicans, because that's what you find in Scotland is Scotland and what you find in Mexico is Mexicans.
[51:29.000 --> 51:39.000]  Now, if cultures naturally grew together and over hundreds of years it became something else, that's normal and natural.
[51:39.000 --> 51:51.000]  But when it's forced and when Scotland and Germany and France and the United States and Canada and Australia have to, and Russia,
[51:51.000 --> 52:00.000]  they're telling Russia this too, have to pay to bring in hundreds of millions from the billions of third world populations and then under political correctness,
[52:00.000 --> 52:12.000]  give up your culture because it's offensive to the radical Islamists being brought in, mainly military aged men, that you're having an October fest.
[52:12.000 --> 52:17.000]  Or that your wife's wearing a skirt or isn't wearing a bag over her head.
[52:17.000 --> 52:22.000]  See, it's not oppressive to women to make them wear burkas in a western civilization.
[52:22.000 --> 52:28.000]  It's bigoted and hateful that I just said it's a bag over a woman's head and I don't like it.
[52:28.000 --> 52:33.000]  And they had a major German governor on Thursday, you can pull it up, it was Ender Spiegel with a straight face.
[52:33.000 --> 52:40.000]  They said there's a town of 3,000 people, 4,000 illegals are being brought in, they're being told you will pay for it.
[52:40.000 --> 52:51.000]  And they said, why are you doing this, why, why? And they said, if you don't like it, leave. And Facebook works with the government to flag people who are arrested and their children taken
[52:51.000 --> 52:55.000]  if you criticize the godlike immigrants.
[52:55.000 --> 53:04.000]  And German schoolchildren are taken in their field trips and made to feed and clean the quote migrants.
[53:04.000 --> 53:12.000]  And then they say, oh, well, the West blew up the Middle East, we have to do this. The West funded the Arab Spring to destabilize the Middle East to put in radicals.
[53:12.000 --> 53:22.000]  And these aren't even the real migrants that are coming in. They don't want the Christian Syrians, they're being put in camps and actually sent back to be murdered.
[53:22.000 --> 53:29.000]  That's in the news. These are military aged men, you've seen it on the news, pouring in, attacking, you name it.
[53:29.000 --> 53:45.000]  This is what the socialists in the EU want, is a political block that'll burn down cities anytime they're basically ordered to, as we've seen in London, Paris and other capitals.
[53:45.000 --> 53:56.000]  In fact, Watson had a Gateway Pundit article on Info Wars that had the Twitter photo saying, this is migrants in Syria and it's men and women and children, but it's mainly women and children.
[53:56.000 --> 54:02.000]  This is migrants in Germany and it just shows thousands of men with their fists up.
[54:02.000 --> 54:08.000]  They aren't, they are attacking, they're marching around with clubs. I mean, these are third world countries in the Middle East where they kill each other.
[54:08.000 --> 54:17.000]  And these aren't the folks that had money and wanted to stay. These are the angry young men from the population that's doubled the last 30 years, the Middle East.
[54:17.000 --> 54:33.000]  So let's look at who's behind this. Peter Sutherland, the former head of Goldman Sachs Europe, the former head of British Petroleum Worldwide, both organizations known to basically be tax exempt worldwide.
[54:33.000 --> 54:42.000]  Peter, in fact, let me just show you the encyclopedia breakdown. It's on his own website, PeterSutherland.co.uk, where you can read his own bio.
[54:42.000 --> 54:56.000]  He was EU commissioner and head of the World Trade Organization. Before that, he helped stealth integrate Europe under a trade deal and announced the EU in 92 and got every member country but the UK to enter without voting.
[54:56.000 --> 55:13.000]  And that's called dictatorship, it's called totalitarianism. He was chairman of the committee that produced the Sutherland report for the European Economic Community, EEC, just like the TPP then becomes a regional government, unelected.
[55:13.000 --> 55:21.000]  He was the chairman of Goldman Sachs International. He was chairman of BP.
[55:21.000 --> 55:28.000]  He served as the steering committee for Bilderberg Group. He was chairman of the Board of Governors, European Institute for Public Administration.
[55:28.000 --> 55:34.000]  He was appointed as a member of the Hong Kong Chief Executive Council. This is going back in 98. I'm going backwards here.
[55:34.000 --> 55:45.000]  In January 2006, he was appointed by the United Nations Secretary General, coffee on on as his special representative on migration and borders. I'm going to stop right there.
[55:45.000 --> 55:53.000]  He says again, EU must undermine national homogeneity says UN migration chief.
[55:53.000 --> 56:01.000]  They lower the borders. They then implode the sovereignty.
[56:01.000 --> 56:15.000]  And then they bring in at least 5 million quote migrants in the last two years and then they offer free healthcare, free have your babies. The Swedes have an airline doing dozens of flights a day to fly folks in from the Middle East who live there free.
[56:15.000 --> 56:23.000]  The US advertises, you know, 10,000 Chinese women a month, come here have their babies for free. CNN says it's a great deal.
[56:23.000 --> 56:36.000]  The board patrol completes the smuggling process. And again, this is done to create client groups they control who will be used for menial labor and as political stooges, their victims as well.
[56:36.000 --> 56:44.000]  And our Latin American immigrants do have some criminals in them and do have some serious problems.
[56:44.000 --> 56:53.000]  But nothing. Nothing compared to what's coming into Europe.
[56:53.000 --> 57:02.000]  So this is the checkmate move. This is it.
[57:02.000 --> 57:20.000]  And just last week he came out and said quote EU must take more refugees quote get rid of sovereignty. So I have his latest quotes as we look at the type of people himself pays almost no taxes part of multinational tax exempt diplomatic community.
[57:20.000 --> 57:27.000]  And he says to Europe, I've got all his quotes here in the last few weeks. How dare you only take 3 million people in Germany.
[57:27.000 --> 57:35.000]  How dare you. And this is their unified confidence game front going you're going to sit there and you're going to take it or we're going to arrest you.
[57:35.000 --> 57:45.000]  You're going to take unlimited people while the unelected EU run by Goldman Sachs gang rapes and shuts countries dry and sucks billions of dollars out of them.
[57:45.000 --> 57:47.000]  They're criminals.
[57:47.000 --> 57:59.000]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in. No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health nerve growth factors and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[57:59.000 --> 58:07.000]  Just one of the key compounds bio PQQ is backed by major clinical studies. You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere.

[58:17.000 --> 58:25.000]  Brain force is here. Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months. You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy and it's because of brain force.
[58:25.000 --> 58:32.000]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives staring at the computer all day working doing good. You're still damaging your brain.
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[58:34.000 --> 58:48.000]  It doesn't have stimulus. It doesn't have garbage in it. It has natural things that do it clean. You will find brain force and other game changing products at info wars life dot com or call 888-253-3139.
[58:48.000 --> 58:57.000]  Another major health threat. This one in Toledo, Ohio where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water. Ohio governor declaring a state of emergency.
[58:57.000 --> 59:07.000]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day? If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[59:07.000 --> 59:10.000]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[59:10.000 --> 59:15.000]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo. You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[59:15.000 --> 59:24.000]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe clean water, water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[59:24.000 --> 59:27.000]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[59:27.000 --> 59:38.000]  The Pro Pure Pro 1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must have for every modern independently minded household. Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[59:38.000 --> 59:51.000]  Go to infowarstore.com today to purchase your Pro Pure Pro 1 G2.0 water filtration system or call 1-88-253-3139.
[59:51.000 --> 59:55.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:19.000]  We're going to open the phones up on Hillary's announcement that they should look at Australian-style National Force gun buybacks in confiscation.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  Also, what do you think of people like Peter Sutherland saying, hey, you got to take unlimited amounts of people and pay for them or you're not moral.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  You're racist when he's basically tax-exempt.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  The toll-free number for first-time callers to join us today is 877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  And please, we're just doing first-time callers today so folks have never had a chance to call in, have a chance to be part of the broadcast.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  But I'm sitting here, and again, this is just the beginning of profiling Sutherland.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  This is just me hitting some of the lowlights.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  We're going to be getting into his quotes, his history, the tax exemption, what he's pushing for for this international banking elite,
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  this international slave goods selling elite like Walmart, to exempt themselves from everything,
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  and then have the middle class of the West pay for them to go in and conquer the Third World, raise carbon taxes on the Third World,
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  shut down Third World development, militarily implode the Third World, and then flood the West with basically slave labor and political minions
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  to then checkmate us politically and then conquer the world.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  This is how megabanks conquer the world.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  Like here's an Alex Jones quote, in the past, armies conquered nations and people.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  Now, corporate banking combines conquer nations with giant immigrant floods and devalued currencies.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  It's 21st century warfare, and it's what we're facing.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  Here he is at the stewardship report.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  You can go to his website and read all these sickening essays as he sits up there running the globalist destabilization program worldwide.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  The UN controls borders all over the planet and areas they've already brought down.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  And then he sits back and then blames the crisis on Europe and says you should pay for everything.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  Truly sick.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  Refugees of the responsibility of the world, Peter Sutherland, and the Vatican says the same thing.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  The Pope says the same thing, but has 200 foot walls.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  I was saying 30, 40 foot walls till folks said those aren't 30 foot, they're 200 feet tall.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  They pay for nothing.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  They give nothing to the poor.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  They have hundreds of trillions of dollars.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  But sit there and lecture us how we're bad.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  And can we put on screen just to search the term Peter Sutherland?
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  Or I can pull up an article and show you a picture of myself and just look at this pingwan-esque creature who looks like a microwaved version of many me that's been bloating and rotting in the sun.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  Just the obvious, arrogant, pimpish eyes, the pimpish, portly, parasitical phenomenon that we've seen so many times in the PPP class.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  And it is just thoroughly disgusting to see this slime sucker going around.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  But you know what, when I really go after Mr. Sutherland, I shouldn't go after the fact that he looks like a reanimated wart on two legs in a bipedal stance.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  What I'm going to be going after him for is the fact of what he did to Ireland.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  And if you can read his own bio, he's quite proud of it.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  He's the one that got Ireland.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  He's like the first man of Ireland, the first pimp, the Bill Clinton of Ireland.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  He's the one that pimped him.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  He's the one that put him on the street.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  He's the one that Jack slapped him and they bit down and thanked him for it.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  He's the guy that took Ireland from being the number one economic engine in Europe for 15 years.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  Got him to sign on to the EU, signed them then on to all this debt that they didn't owe.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  That's come out in the news, 90 plus percent of it.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  And then now they're totally in shambles imploding as he and others suck them dry.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  But don't worry, he goes to St. Patty's Day events and wears green hats and has green umbrellas and goes,
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  look at the Irish, look at me gang raping you, hey, the pot of gold, be your money.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  I'm gonna screw you over.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  I be Peter Sutherland of the New World Order Goldman Sachs.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  Bend over me, Patty's, because I got a hot poker for you.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  The Obama administration is spending $75 million a year arming special agents with the Environmental Protection Agency
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  with drones, night vision goggles, camouflage, guns and assault ships.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  The EPA is equipping its own army to take out US polluters.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:23.000]  Watchdog Group opened the books, examined thousands of checks totaling more than $93 billion from 2000 to 2014.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  And they found that $75 million is authorized each year for criminal enforcement of America's clean air and water laws.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  Some of these weapons are for full scale military operations.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  Two years ago, the EPA was involved in an armed raid at a small town in Alaska where miners were accused of polluting local waters.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  It's incredibly ironic considering that it was the Environmental Protection Agency,
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  who was recently guilty of dumping millions of pounds of toxic wastewater into the Animas River in Colorado,
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  causing untold damage to the environment for years to come.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  Read more now at infowars.com.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  So they told us fluoride was good for us.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  Now Harvard admits it's causing 10 to 14 point IQ drops in children, a seven fold increase in just one type of bone cancer
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  and all sorts of reproductive problems. That's Reuters.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  So they told us there wasn't a plan to launch a world government and that that world government wouldn't have carbon taxes.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  And of course, that's all now been announced. I'll never forget it's in my film Endgame.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  The film is now eight years old. It's free online. More important than ever, Endgame.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  We have Peter Sutherland in there we were talking about earlier.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  The open borders UN chief, the migration chief.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  And Clinton is asked for the last things we put in the film because he said it like two weeks before the film was done.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  Al Gore was asked. Hillary was asked. They were all asked, you know, with this huge carbon move you're trying to pass through Congress,
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  you're going to make money off the carbon taxes it says in the bill.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  And Al Gore looks at the congressman, the chairman and says,
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  and people believe that we didn't go to the moon and the flying saucers are real.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  And the chairman went, listen, this is the bill you own the carbon exchange in London with your partners.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  You're going to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year off this.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  And Al Gore said, no, there's no carbon tax. It doesn't exist.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000]  And started laughing at him.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  And in that is the key really to so much.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  They think you're so stupid that when we would tell you 20 years ago they were keeping babies alive outside the womb to harvest their organs in America.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  That was in lawsuits that came out in trials that came out in criminal cases.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  Abortion workers would blow the whistle on that cops would rate them locally. They didn't diet them and the feds would come in and try to shut it down.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  But now you know about that because of the internet and whistleblowers and people infiltrating.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  And it's the same thing. We're just here drawing attention to all this.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  World government is being set up. It's totalitarian. It's draconian. It's unelected. It's anti-human.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  It is modern slavery. It's fantastical. It's so bad.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  Global secret treaties are being ratified internationally and only the State Department and the WTOs involved.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  Congress can't even see it and they agreed to it two weeks ago tomorrow.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  They've been ratifying it for two years. It'll be two weeks tomorrow since the ratification was complete at the global level and the American people can't see it.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  When judicial watch sued in 2007 and got the North American Union documents out of the North American Union summit in Waco, Texas two years before and in Banff, Canada that year, thousands of pages was then available.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  They have the Fortune 100 voting. They vote in an actual Congress at the Banff, Canada Hotel at the Big Luxury Hotel.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  Then less than 50 representatives of governments worldwide, not just the North American Union, Canada, Mexico and the United States, then vote on agreeing to the corporate agreement that was passed and they have every time unanimous signatures by the governments.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  But these are unelected. These are the State Departments, the Presidents, the Presidents, the Prime Ministers.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  The top executives are there with the other top executives who finance their campaigns. They actually have governmental meetings, a new government.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  This is a declaration of independence, not a freedom, but a declaration of independence by select corporations to buy off government, to meet under government security in five-star hotels and to transfer power to themselves.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  If that isn't sensational, I don't know what is. What is your view on this? What do you think about it? What are you going to do about it? And Hillary announcing that she does want to have Australian-style gun confiscation.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  We played that last hour. We'll be playing that again because it's so unbelievable.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  877-789-2539, 877-789, Alex, first-time callers. Leah, Robert, Ben, John, Russ, Rob, we'll get to all of you coming up at the start of the next segment.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  But you've got the former head of Goldman Sachs, Europe, the former head of BP worldwide, Peter Sutherland, who got a decade ago, the Irish, who were the richest country per capita after Switzerland, Europe.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  They'd gone from being poor to having the biggest economy per capita, some of the highest increases in incomes, savings.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  He came in, he took over, promised them under the EU they'd do great. Within four years, they were bankrupt. He'd signed them on to over 200 billion euro dollars that were not their debts.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  92% was not their debt, just like Greece, just like Iceland. And now they are in freefall going bankrupt.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  Let's see, foreign armies couldn't conquer Ireland because they'd fight back, but their own people in their own garb, in their own tongue, they could bring them down.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  And now we're under a North American Union, the average American doesn't even know it. The European Union, do folks know that exists if you're a new luster?
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  Or do you think that's a conspiracy theory? There is a European Union. It started as a steel deal in 56, the Treaty of Rome. It became official that it would become a Union in 92.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  No votes were allowed by the countries. Their bureaucracies were bought off by Peter Sutherland, David Rockefeller, the Bilderberg group and others that he chaired.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  They bought the politicians, and now the politicians are tax exempt, diplomatic community, do not pay EU taxes as the people do.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  Look it up, EU bureaucrats do not pay tax. And when the Brits put up with that, they never got to enter the EU by vote.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  Over 90% of their laws, it was 83, now it's 90 plus percent. The parliament estimates is made by the EU, the unelected EU bureaucracy.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  There is an EU parliament, we've had members of it on, but they are ceremonial. They only give recommendations to the permanent bureaucracy.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  That's called a dictatorship. We're being merged with the American Union into the Atlantic European Union and the Asian Union right now.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  And it's written to end free speech, it's written to end cash as you know it. It's written to end secure surfing and it brings in internet IDs.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  And everything is now being aligned. It doesn't let you not eat GMO. It worldwide bans labeling. That's been leaked.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  Of the 28 sections, only three sections have been leaked by WikiLeaks. And that's because WikiLeaks is political and doesn't want you to have all of it.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  Oh, they want you to know that they plan to end internet freedom because Google doesn't want that to happen right now. They want to monopolize things.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  They want to use a free web to take over. But as soon as they're done, they'll get rid of it as well.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  So this is it, folks. What are you going to do about it? You got to speak up. You got to get the word out that this is happening.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  This is so over the top that it has a chance to succeed because it's so draconian. It's so incredible. The lie is so big.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  But that also makes it conversely weak because if we ever wake up to the fact that the emperor is not wearing any clothes and we get past the peer pressure and we point out this is going on, it's game over.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  And that's the good news. Congress has a 9% approval rating for four years running. Both political parties are hated.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  The anti-globalist Tea Party is taken over the Republican Party. All over the world, nationalist pro-liberty parties are rising. Folks are seeing through it.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  They're discovering what's happening. And in response, European countries are saying, from England to Germany, we will arrest you if you criticize any immigrants or radical Islam.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  But that's only making Germans and Brits and others that much matter. So you're seeing real cracks in the facade right now. Some good things are happening.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  And the Russians are hammering the West proxy army, Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  Many of the products at InfoWarsLife.com are true game changers. They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nacin iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over 100 years.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine accrued form of it be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves. What do you have to lose? You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock. We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out. It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  So I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.

[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:33.000]  It's always a tough vote because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt. Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over 100 times, does not increase our debt. It does not somehow promote profligacy.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  All it does is it says, you've got to pay the bills that you've already racked up Congress.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:50.000]  Alright, I'm going to go to your phone calls in the order they were received. Rob, Russ, Robert, Carl, Leah, many others. We're going to start taking your calls here in just a moment.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  But when you take somebody else's money and then give it to somebody else and say you're moral and then that person votes for you because you're giving them free stuff, that is a form of slavery.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  And obviously we need some welfare, some social safety net, but that's been used and exploited domestically. And now giant hordes are being brought in, made politically correct, dipped into anti-Western ideology, given a sense of entitlement and set up as the new political ruling class's minions.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  And I just personally marvel that we have the head of Goldman Sachs, the former head of Goldman Sachs, the former head of the Bilderberg group, calling for world government and saying Europe hasn't taken enough people because Germany's only taken 3 million, England's taken over a million, other countries millions.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  I mean it's over 5 million in the last year. And then that's encouraging more and more Saudi Arabia won't take one of these people when Saudi Arabia started the wars in the Middle East with their armies more than anybody.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:25.000]  Oh but you don't criticize them because they have brown skin and they wear hoods and that's politically incorrect. They're perfect little angels, killing Christians, putting you in prison if they catch you being a Christian in Saudi Arabia.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  Or coming outside your controlled area you're supposed to be in and telling someone about Jesus Christ, that's okay. But America and Europe hasn't done enough.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:50.000]  They're breaking our will, they're flaunting it in our face, they think we're stupid. They think we're dumb.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  Because if they can get away with having Peter Sutherland of the UN say we're a bunch of trash.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  That Europe's bad because they haven't taken enough people and the welfare is not good enough when he's tax exempt and making money off all this and helped implode the Middle East to begin with.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  And helped finance all these wars that destroyed the Middle East. Goldman Sachs was right there lobbying for the first Gulf War.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  Owned Tony Blair. It's come out again another memo where they knew Saddam wasn't involved in 9-11 and said we're going to fix the intelligence to set up the Iraqis.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  This guy's involved in that mass murder. He's going to lecture you and I that we're bad people. We haven't done enough as he conquers Europe with his radical Islamic invasion.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  That's how they take over countries in the 21st century is with giant controlled immigrant waves and welfare. Not with armies.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  But then if you criticize the open borders they send paramilitary police to arrest your mind in. Let's go to phone calls right now.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:10.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rob in Missouri. You're on the air. Go ahead on the second amendment.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  He just dropped as I went to him. That was that was wild. I've never gone to a caller right as they hang up. That was interesting.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  Let's talk to Rob in Canada. Let's go ahead and talk to Rob in Canada. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  Hi Alex. First time long time. I just wanted to call in and comment on the Canadian election that's happening tomorrow on Monday and just basically the lack of choice in the election.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  And the fact that I'm going to do something I haven't done in my life and vote for a social Democrat party as we only have one party here opposing TPP at least on the surface.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  Well that's what the Democrats and Liberals will do and Tory will do it when the when the Democrats are in power in England or vice versa.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  Is that when they know they've already got the votes to get Canada signed on to the TPP they'll then have the Liberals and people like Bernie Sanders here act like they're against it.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  But as soon as in the Senate they had the votes to audit the Federal Reserve Bernie Sanders then voted against it.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  He voted for it when they didn't have the votes. But as soon as his vote counted he voted against it. That's the same thing on TPP.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  I would actually caution you on that. Generally conservatives even though your guy is bad news and a globalist the party is better because of guns and family issues than the Liberals.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  Because the Liberals are only saying they oppose TPP because it's already been signed on to. But you're in Canada you probably know more about it than I do correct me.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  No I mean you're pretty right and I've historically voted conservative but the last government of the past 10 years I'm not sure if you're aware they've signed over 30 free trade agreements and they've effectively doubled our immigration level with a temporary form worker program initiated through stealth.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  Well sure and again let's not play their game. They call these trade agreements these are international treaties ceding Canadian sovereignty to an unelected multinational corporate fascist secret board.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  And that isn't rhetoric it is an ultra fascist ultra crony capitalist ultra secret multinational board that literally hires the wives and husbands of the Chinese US Canadian German British you name it.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  Families they literally hire the families of the politicians to then run it as they rape the population financially.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  Yeah we're feeling it here I'm trying to start a blog up here in Canada but I worked jobs my wife works a job and a job at home we're working our butts up just to support a family. It's crazy the taxes here are twice or three times what you guys pay down there and it's unbelievable over 40% of our income goes straight to tax off the top and that doesn't include 14% sale tax and everything we buy.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  Well just to be clear they claim that lower income earners only pay like 1520% it's way higher if you count social security all the other stuff the average American pays about 25% federal you had all the other fines fees regulations up the average person pays about 45% in tax.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  The middle class person pays about 65 but listen in France a blue collar worker pays about half and a middle class person making over 100,000 euros a year pays about 80% a millionaire pays 101% five years running to actually make them poor.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  Now once you're making billions a year your tax exempt do you understand you do you see that whole game there the ultra rich want to get rid of a middle class.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  Oh certainly in here in Canada we had the federal government right off.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  Billions of dollars in sort of delinquent taxes that were owed by very high income earners and they just decided to write them off.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  Meanwhile going after people like myself for two $300 in back taxes aggressively too.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  Oh yeah they changed the regulations years ago here in the US to where white collar crime enforcers have been reduced over 90% billionaires aren't investigated unless they're politically active against tyranny.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  If you join with the globalist and don't criticize them you're basically allowed to even murder people if you're wealthy but if you criticize the private Federal Reserve if you criticize the globalist they will send the FBI after you.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  Look they've already indicted Ron Paul and Rand Paul's former chief of staff that is trying to dig dirt up on them.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  I mean this is a criminal mafia organization God bless you.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  We just spent that whole segment with that caller I'm going to get to more callers straight ahead on the other side of this quick break the toll free number to join us of course is 87789 Alex stay with us.

[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  This lad was green and good until
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000]  Interesting fact
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  It's Alex Jones
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  I'm hyped up. I'm angry. I'm barking. I'm just trying to get people alerted and warned of what's happening.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  I was going to go to calls in order and I'm going to go to Leah who had her daughter taken by CPS. Very hurtful calls to take.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  Because I empathize. We're going to go to Annika. We're going to go to Russ. We're going to go to John. We're going to go to BIM. We're going to go to Carl. We're going to go to Phil.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  But one of these call callers Carl, I'm going to go to first because I just love these questions.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  I got one of these on Friday.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  And it illustrates so much. Wonders if Alex is controlled opposition.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  Gee, do you wonder if Hillary's coming after your guns? Do you wonder if they're getting rid of our borders and bringing in world government?
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  Do you wonder if fluoride in the water is causing cancer and brain damage?
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  I mean, look, for your ego, yes, I'm bad. You're better than me. You're pure of heart. I'm bad. I'm loyal opposition.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:54.000]  Now, can you just do something about the fluoride and the cancer viruses and the vaccines and the death list for the veterans not being given treatment and the open borders?
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  Of course, I'm not loyal opposition.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  But what type of little excuses that where everyone just spends all their time saying, this guy's a fed. That guy's a fed. Fine. We're all bad. You know, you're good. Do something.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  But I'm going to go to you.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  But this other guy called in and said, I saw on the Internet, you might be a Mason.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  I'm not a Mason, but the Masons are incredibly complex, incredibly old. You can't say good or bad. It's what you do with the institutions.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  I mean, it's just idiocy. It's not the Jews fault. It's not the blacks fault. It's not the white people's fault. It's not the Russians fault.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  It is the fault of corrupt people working in the system. And we've got to change that. But I'm going to go back to you in a minute.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  Or go to you in a moment. Briefly, most talk show hosts would plug every segment, products and sponsors.

[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  Wonder out loud. Do we wonder if fluoride's causing cancer in the water?
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  Do we wonder if they're coming after our guns? No. Do we wonder, do we wonder, do we wonder?
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  What is this fascination? It's Project Mockingbird. Not you, but the people all day.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  There's more Jew bashers attacking me than any Jew or Benjamin Netanyahu.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  Because it's federally funded. I'm not even Jewish. I just don't hate Jews.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  There's more bashing by the mason bashers against me than other masons, literally.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  That are real masons. It's crazy. The truth is I like our founding fathers.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  A lot of them are masons. That's why they call me a mason. Fine. I am one.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  I'm Jewish. I'm masonic. I'm Mexican. I'm black. I'm German, which actually am.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  I'm English, which I mean, just I'm all the bad things, okay? Boom. I'm bad.
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  You're good. You're a winner. You're moral. You're better than me. I'm scum. I'm filth.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  I'm trash. Good. You are a man. I am trash. You're better than me.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  Now get out there and take on the globalists right now. Do something. We're under attack.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  Go ahead Carl. Set me straight. Show me what a man you are. Set me in line right now.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  Yeah. Look at all your accomplishments. Tell me right now.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  Yeah. Can you hear me?
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  Yeah. Of course I can hear you. I just went to you.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  Yeah. So first off, I'm going to say I'm a fan and this is not an attack, but...
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  I'll attack all I want. We're under attack.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  Yeah. I know. And I'm not attacking you. I'm really, I'm not sure.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  If you are controlled out of this...
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  I am. I am. You caught me. That's why I went to you.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  You just, you, oh, you just scored a point. You just counted two. You just took your first scalp.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  You just took down Alex Jones. I knew you'd do that. What a big man you are.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  Oh, whoa. Yeah. I'm loyal opposition. Like I'm a Chinese jet pilot from Mars. Go ahead.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  But you know, you got to be paranoid after waking up for the first time that everything coming at you is alive.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  So I'm really just questioning everything. So, you know, I really just had to bring this question to you.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  I know. I know. No one ever goes to the actual geoengineering documents or the actual emergency centers documents on the confirmed camps.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  They just keep running around looking for the theory. They can't prove. I get it.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  Well, hear me out. So the idea is that, like, you're popularized on purpose by the evil society controllers.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:06.000]  But the idea of you being like an information gatekeeper...
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  So that you're discovering the truth for the first time will most likely discover it through you and get your version of the truth.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:18.000]  And that's the advantage of the gatekeeper being that rookie conspiracy theorists always get your version of the truth first.
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  And the great truth you're trying to show, which I love and which got me hooked on you the first place,
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  it becomes like a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down, where the medicine is like...
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  Well, listen, God bless you. And I just want to just congratulate you on discovering the truth and now tune into another show or go off and bash me all day.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  Okay? That's all I can say. I'm going to continue trying to warn people about the big issues.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  Okay. And the truth is I'm just sick of that question. Like I'm sick of people with a radio on in the background.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  It's like Chinese water torture where they just drip it and drip it and drip it and drip it till you go crazy.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  I'm not perfect. I've been very successful in getting people to think. I came from Access Television 21 years ago.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  I'm in 21 year overnight success. It's just crazy.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  People don't believe that anyone could be successful outside the globalist paradigm and that's why we failed. You don't believe in yourself.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  Yes, it's good to question. But I'm financed by you buying products and by the sponsors I have.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  Everything I stand for is completely naked. Do you think they want you knowing Peter Sutherland and Warren Buffett are tax exempt but lobby to have your taxes raised?
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  Do you really think David Rockefeller wants me sticking a camera in his face?
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  Bilderberg, the media said, didn't exist when I started covering it 20 years ago.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  They were still saying it didn't exist 10 years ago. Do you think they like the fact that when I go cover one of these events, now they've got 4,000 people there and helicopters?
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  And I don't want the laurels. I don't want the trophy. That'll get you killed here, brother.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  I'm jumping up and down like Paul Revere screaming that the Redcoats have landed.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  But the Redcoats were angels compared to this. They just wanted to take our guns and raise our taxes and press our kids into service in the British Navy.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  They were bad, but man, they were loving compared to this. These people tell women that, oh, it's 300 bucks to have an abortion.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  They don't tell you they're selling the baby for thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars. They're organs, man.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  Okay, once you get down the list of the New World Order and the big criminals, if there's a big national investigation and we roll up these folks and start arresting them and have Nuremberg trials,
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  I should be investigated once we get to that point. And if it turns out I was part of it, I should be executed, okay?
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  But let's deal with the Death Star coming at us, okay?
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in. No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies. You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives. Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree. It doesn't have stimulus. It doesn't have garbage in it. It has natural things that do it clean.

[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.000]  I am Mark Hattie. I want to review games like my life.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:28.000]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:42.000]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:50.000]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:00.000]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built up toxins and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:15.000]  and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  Livershield is the only liver support product in the market that uses a patented spy Jurex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:32.000]  And when you visit InfowarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six day liver detox.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  This isn't a game and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.

[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.

[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:24.000]  Look, I was not even mad at the last caller.
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  I was just having some fun blowing up because I am frustrated by all the news.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  And when you've been asked thousands of times if you're loyal opposition, if you're controlled by the government, it's not the question itself.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  You've been asked it so much. It's just so stupid.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  And I get for someone for the first time asking it, it's not dumb.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  For me, though, I know who I am. It's just very frustrating.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  And I want to get focused on fighting the admitted globalist agenda that is ending freedom all over the planet.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  I'm being conquered. You're being conquered. I'm upset about that.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  And half the websites fight in the New World Order just gossip and fight with each other all day and say, this person's opposition, loyal opposition, that person's this and that.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  And most of them aren't loyal opposition. They're just got in the habit of trolling each other and fighting with each other.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  So the average person tunes into that and just thinks these are a bunch of crazy people.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:34.000]  Proof is in the pudding. I've been effective at waking people up and getting immobilized.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  And I've been effective at growing the Liberty Movement worldwide.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  I'm just a doorway into all this. You can figure it out for yourself once you're awake.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  I'm just the wake-up call.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  Hey, a bunch of billionaires want to bring in foreigners and make them constituents to outvote you.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  And they want to ban your free speech and sign you on to trillions in debt that isn't yours. Here's their names. Here's how to stop them.
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  Let's go to phone calls. I got to go to phone calls.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  Ben and Pennsylvania, you're on the air. Thanks for holding them. We'll go to Leah. Go ahead.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  Hey, thanks so much, Alex. Hey, I'd like to speak very briefly about 9-11.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  I've been back in the news recently and the back and forth between Trump and Bush.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  And I want to Sunday broadcast a very, very short prayer.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  My Father, Lord Jesus Christ, I pray to you with all my heart that you might provide strength, courage, guidance, wisdom, and inspiration to a true, brave, and selfless, selfless patriot from within the ranks of our military, our intelligence community,
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  or a current or past elected representative to enable them to release directly to the American people the full and complete text of the illegally and immorally classified and redacted 28 pages of the 9-11 report.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  Amen. Amen.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  You know, Alex, while it certainly will not be the last word on the full depth of the betrayal of the American people, the release of the full and unredacted report, like pulling on a thread of a poorly made jacket,
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:32.000]  will help to fall away the cloak of lies surrounding this act of genocide and treason. It will bring down not only the degenerate House of Salud, but the House of Bush, the House of Clinton, and the House of Obama, who has been a willing accomplice in this crime against humanity.
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  I totally agree with you and you're definitely the caller of the day, my friend. That's why I should just have hours every day where it's just callers getting to say what they want on air and not me babbling around.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  Trump came out and said, hey, Jeb, shut up about me not being able to run the military. You know, 9-11 happened on your brother's watch and he said, you know, how dare you.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  He was president okay, but don't blame him. Well, we know the 28 pages from Senator Graham and Senator Jones that have seen it and military we've had on that have seen it.
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  It says Saudi Arabia ran the attacks to blame Iraq. That was always the plan. And then our own government bare minimum stood down. And of course it was more than that. But we have the fact that it now to a great extent was an inside job.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  Now we have the Daily Mail, Reuters and others smoking gun emails reveal Blair's deal and blood with George W. Bush over Iraq war was forged a year before the invasion had even started.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  Now we have the White House and Downing Street memos. This is another memo now. And in it, this is confirmed in it. They knew that Saddam wasn't involved and just wanted to invade and they killed over a million Iraqis.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  So this shows they framed a whole country for a false flag attack and did it. So Saudi Arabia that runs ISIS could now take over.
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  This is a Wahhabist Sunni operation to take over the Middle East that our government's working with. And so they attack us and then we attack their enemies. You can see the setup and it's becoming clear and clear.
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  And so you're absolutely right. So thank God it's all starting to come out closing comment on that.
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:23.000]  Well, you know, absolutely. You know, there's lots of roots to the evil that we see unfolding around us. But the single biggest lie upon which this ever increasing tyranny that we see unfolding around us is built upon is the lie of 9-11.
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:34.000]  That's right. Yeah, yeah. Give up all your liberties. We'll keep you safe. 14 years later, Al Qaeda and ISIS are 20 times bigger than they were. And more of our freedoms are being taken. Absolutely great point. God bless you.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:43.000]  We should all pray that false flags be exposed because they're going to keep doing them. Oklahoma City was purely staged by the government.
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  We don't know about 9-11 from my deep research and I'm one of the main guys if you're a new listener that got into all that. We know the official story isn't real.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  We know the government protected the Patsy's. Probably were Patsy's. And we know that elements of the government were involved and other foreign governments as well.
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  Leah in California, welcome to the airwaves. Go ahead.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  Hi. Hi, go ahead.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000]  All right. Hi, daughter.
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  Okay, we only got a few minutes, ma'am. I know you say your daughter's been tagging. That's very hard to deal with. Just give it to us in a nutshell. Go ahead.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:31.000]  My daughter's been taken to the PCS due to allegations on my husband. We have set up a state public account. We have an attorney.
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  Well, that's good. I mean, usually the problem is, is it your ex-husband made some claims or you're saying your husband?
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  My husband. It's allegations on him from my mother.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:53.000]  Yeah, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's terrible, ma'am. The problem is this early in a case or something, you know, it's so complex. I don't know the facts. I don't know what's going on.
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:54:05.000]  But I know that the CPS generally will leave a child with a crack head, but children that are healthy and happy, they will take because they can get money for them in an adoption racket.
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  And that's why folks should be very careful before they call CPS, even if they think something's going on, because it can be a lot worse. What, what's happened to you?
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  To me, they just won't work with me. They won't face the family and we, we, that they're trying to sell, sell her or get, or put her up for adoption.
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  No. So they're, well ma'am, send us an email at showtipsandinfowars.com with your details and we will try to look into it as best we can.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:42.000]  We get hundreds of emails a week, people having their kids taken here in the so-called land of the free home of the brave.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:46.000]  But Leah, God bless you and I'm sorry to hear that's happening.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  We're also going to move and try to move because I'm noticing this more and more, like on cell phones and things to digital phone lines and maybe have a special number for folks that have digital phone lines because I can't understand how to phone calls myself.
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  And we're going to have a meeting about it after the show today. Russ in Utah, Russ, you're on the air. Welcome.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  Alex, thank you for taking my call. How are you doing this afternoon?
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  Good brother. Thank you for holding. Go ahead.
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  Cool. Hey, I just wanted to call the screener about some jade helmet patchy helicopter footage I have. I'm going to send that into showtips tonight.
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  Sure. What'd you see happen?
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  Oh, dude, I worked out in the oil fields, like literally right on the green river up here in Northeastern Utah. There's like five patchy attack helicopters, fully armed.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  They flew like 200 feet right over my head. Got the whole thing on film. I mean, it was wild.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  What do you think they were up to? Because they got plenty of military reservations to train on.
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  They do exactly. I don't know. We don't have any military anything around here. You know, we're a bunch of oil field workers.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  Well, you know, they do that to acclimate the public. It's not the military's bad, but their mission is to prepare us for military occupation.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:02.000]  I mean, the police admit we're giving armored vehicles quote for the veterans and gun owners. So it's all part of that, my friend.
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  Yeah. And it's just like you say, they're all compartmentalized. They don't know exactly the big picture of everything. They're just doing their little job, whatever it is.
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  And they think everything's great. And it's not.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  And that's so they ever have to take over your state house and take out your governor or whatever, you know.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  Oh, I saw that 100 times before. It's no big deal.
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  Unreal, man. I just wish everybody was awake like we are. But real quick, I know you got a bunch of phone calls to go to.
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  I need to apologize for my posting on your discos thing. I posted Captain Crunch. I'll watch my language on there.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  And as far as the guns go, Hillary, if you want them, come and get them.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  God bless you, brother. I don't think people need to apologize for cuss words on the comment section of Info Wars, because if you're going to do it, you're going to do it.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  We'd rather folks not do that. But here's the deal. We're real people. You're real people.
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  And we get mad sometimes. This is upsetting. I blow up sometimes because I'm very frustrated.
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  John in Colorado, we only got about a minute. Go ahead. Thanks for holding.
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  Colorado, one of the exchanges. They say 80,000 people are going to lose their Obamacare at the first of the year.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  This is something we need to check out. It was Dye News and NBC affiliate in Colorado.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  Oh, I know. They put you on it and then they kick you off and raise your prices. It's horrible.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  The insurance companies wrote it to really screw folks over. The big, vicious, multinational ones.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  Their profits are up 47% in just two years worldwide on American backs. Bipartisan.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  And the Republicans won't get rid of it. That's why we got rid of Boehner. God bless you.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  I am aware of that, actually, sir. It's a monumental screw job. Thank you all for listening. God bless you for your support.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  We'll see you back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central.
