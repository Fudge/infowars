[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  It's Sunday, January 17th, the year is 2021.
[00:10.000 --> 00:15.640]  We have three days from the Communist Chinese agent Joe Biden being installed in this massive
[00:15.640 --> 00:21.720]  level of crackdown designed to bring us into a permanent depression for social re-engineering.
[00:21.720 --> 00:28.000]  But Infowars has discovered the documented evidence of who exactly attacked the Capitol
[00:28.000 --> 00:30.000]  and who led the false flag.
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  It's all coming up today.
[00:32.000 --> 00:36.000]  You do not want to miss one second of this broadcast, my Paul Revere's.
[00:36.000 --> 00:40.000]  However you're listening, tell everyone you know, tune in now.
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.000]  It's all about the Great Reset.
[00:43.000 --> 00:47.000]  This year's Davos is very, very different to all the previous ones.
[00:47.000 --> 00:54.000]  The World Economic Forum, along with the United Nations, along with the International Monetary Fund,
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.000]  along with any number of prominent globalist organisations and powerful individuals,
[00:59.000 --> 01:06.000]  including Prince Charles, together have jointly promised that the 2021 World Economic Forum
[01:06.000 --> 01:13.000]  will be used to introduce via a vast network of connected big tech corporations,
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  online activist movements and compliant local and national governments,
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.000]  something they call the Great Reset.
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.000]  It is a global commitment they have made to use the panic and fear generated by the coronavirus
[01:27.000 --> 01:34.000]  as a means to reshape all our economies and laws and move to a new form of capitalism
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  that focuses on net zero emissions.
[01:37.000 --> 01:39.000]  And this is real evil we're facing.
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  And so folks need to understand that it's coming in to shut everything down.
[01:45.000 --> 01:47.000]  There's a global revolution against the New World Order.
[01:47.000 --> 01:51.000]  Globalism is a consortium of corporations that do not want free market.
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.000]  They want fascist monopoly to carry out eugenics.
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.000]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[01:59.000 --> 02:06.000]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services,
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.000]  we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[02:09.000 --> 02:15.000]  Australia's vaccine regulator says it's investigating reports of deaths among elderly patients in Norway
[02:15.000 --> 02:17.000]  who have received the Pfizer jab.
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.000]  I call them globalists because they call themselves globalists starting in the 70s of Bigden-Brasinski.
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  Globalist believes in global government, not international man in libertarianism.
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  And you can travel and live wherever you want.
[02:29.000 --> 02:30.000]  And there's standardized systems.
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  I'm all for that as long as it's free market.
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.000]  As long as people agree to it, it's not authoritarian.
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  But the Great Reset and saying you're not essential in shutting down small businesses
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  and coming with forced inoculations.
[02:41.000 --> 02:44.000]  And all of this is authoritarian globalism.
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.000]  Technocracy in their own words.
[02:46.000 --> 02:52.000]  One of the features of this forced industrial revolution is that it doesn't change what we are doing,
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  but it changes us.
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  This is criminal what's happening.
[02:56.000 --> 02:57.000]  And this is all the Great Reset.
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000]  This is all the UN World Government takeover.
[02:59.000 --> 03:00.000]  This is 21st century war.
[03:00.000 --> 03:03.000]  And these are the guys that say we can't have national borders
[03:03.000 --> 03:06.000]  and that we've got to take migrants, quote, into our homes.
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  Outs, numbers, and facing thousands of people determined to enter Guatemala.
[03:11.000 --> 03:17.000]  It doesn't take long for these Hondurans to push through the lines of soldiers
[03:17.000 --> 03:23.000]  at Guatemala's eastern Amor border and press on their aim to reach the United States.
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  Many were held up after not presenting ideas
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  or asked for proof of a negative coronavirus test before entering.
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.000]  But many ignored the formal crossing instead of legally breaching the border nearby.
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  We've all got to have COVID passports to travel even inside the country
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  and not even start your car.
[03:41.000 --> 03:42.000]  That's where all this is going.
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.000]  It's all being announced.
[03:43.000 --> 03:44.000]  It's insane.
[03:44.000 --> 03:45.000]  Wow.
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.000]  We have Jack Dorsey caught secretly by Project Veritas
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  communicating with, he believes, the top executives at Twitter.
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  We, you know, we are focused on one account right now,
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  but this is going to be much bigger than just one account.
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.000]  And it's going to go on for much longer than just this week.
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.000]  The next few weeks depend on beyond integration.
[04:06.000 --> 04:09.000]  We have to expect that we have to be ready for that.
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.000]  So the focus is certainly on this account
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.000]  and how it ties to real-world violence.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  But also, we need to think much longer term
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  around how these dynamics play out over time.
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  I don't believe this is going away at any time soon.
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  We've got the Mexican president coming out
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  saying he's going to lead a global movement.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  Trump should have done this to stop big tech from abusing the people
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  and censoring every one of that.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  This is a criminal combine.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  It's one of the greatest dangers the world's ever seen.
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  That's what Ted Cruz says, too.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  I'm just thinking, God, every day, that I'm not them
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.000]  and not involved in the incredible evil they're involved in.
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  Because these are enslaved, demonically controlled people.
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the video is called,
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  The Great Reset Button Has Been Pushed.
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[05:03.000 --> 05:05.000]  You've got to pray to God and get your soul ready.
[05:05.000 --> 05:08.000]  You've got to be prepared to physically defend yourself and your family.
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.000]  And you've also got to get things that allow you and your family
[05:12.000 --> 05:14.000]  to not be dependent on the system.
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.000]  That's why they want to bankrupt the economy.
[05:16.000 --> 05:19.000]  It's why they want to destroy the infrastructure of this nation.
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.000]  Because they want all of us on our knees
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  so they can dictate our surrender to them.
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.000]  Info Wars is a critical organization
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.000]  in the fight against the globalist.
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  If you gave us straight-up donations, that would be great
[05:31.000 --> 05:33.000]  because our work is important.
[05:33.000 --> 05:34.000]  We appreciate it.
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  But we bring you great products
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  so that you get high-quality products at the same time
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  as supporting the Info War 360 win.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  Well, we've only got a few days left to get
[05:44.000 --> 05:46.000]  20-20 prices before the prices go up
[05:46.000 --> 05:48.000]  on high-quality storeable food
[05:48.000 --> 05:51.000]  with huge discounts as big as $850
[05:51.000 --> 05:54.000]  discount on a year's supply of food
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[05:56.000 --> 05:58.000]  So take advantage of these sales right now
[05:58.000 --> 06:01.000]  at infowarstore.com, where you still can.
[06:20.000 --> 06:22.000]  About two hours ago, I was sitting in the parking lot
[06:22.000 --> 06:25.000]  of the office and I'm not name-dropping.
[06:25.000 --> 06:29.000]  But two big household names sent me a clip
[06:29.000 --> 06:31.000]  you're about to see.
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  I walked through that door
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  and one of the crew members came up and said,
[06:36.000 --> 06:38.000]  Have you seen the footage inside the Capitol?
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.000]  I said, Yeah, I just watched it out in my car in the parking lot.
[06:41.000 --> 06:43.000]  Then the phone rang again. It was my wife.
[06:43.000 --> 06:44.000]  She just seen it.
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  Then the boom operator and camera controller
[06:46.000 --> 06:48.000]  walked in and he said, Have you seen the video?
[06:48.000 --> 06:50.000]  I said, I've seen the video.
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  Then another crew member walked up and said,
[06:52.000 --> 06:53.000]  Have you seen the video?
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.000]  That was $500,000 views in like an hour since then.
[06:57.000 --> 06:58.000]  We're about to show you this.
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  We're going to archive it at infowarstore.com.
[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  But this is really waking everybody up.
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.000]  I'm getting chills.
[07:06.000 --> 07:09.000]  And since I was sent this video two hours ago,
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  we've a little poked around the crew
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.000]  and found stuff even worse.
[07:14.000 --> 07:15.000]  And I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[07:15.000 --> 07:16.000]  Thank you for joining us.
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  Three days left of the Trump presidency
[07:18.000 --> 07:21.000]  and facing the installation of the Chinese
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.160]  the Chinese Communist globalist puppet,
[07:23.160 --> 07:28.160]  Crip Keeper, New World Order frontman, Joe Biden.
[07:29.720 --> 07:33.880]  But wow, this video we're about to play is huge.
[07:33.880 --> 07:36.360]  And the invasion of 7,000 with the latest
[07:36.360 --> 07:38.680]  migrant care events smashing across the
[07:40.840 --> 07:43.400]  southern border of Guatemala on its way to Mexico,
[07:43.400 --> 07:45.560]  all of that ties together.
[07:45.560 --> 07:49.720]  And then a week and a half after the attack,
[07:49.720 --> 07:51.880]  the insurrection, the new Pearl Harbor,
[07:53.200 --> 07:56.200]  as they're calling it and exaggerating it a million times.
[07:59.400 --> 08:01.680]  Well now, independent researchers have been able
[08:01.680 --> 08:06.680]  to dig through and identify who really attacked the Capitol.
[08:06.960 --> 08:08.840]  Now we knew it was Antifun told you that
[08:08.840 --> 08:10.080]  the day of the event.
[08:11.120 --> 08:12.800]  He told you who the operator was,
[08:12.800 --> 08:14.520]  where he came from in Utah,
[08:14.520 --> 08:18.080]  how he led over 100 Antifun addresses Trump supporters.
[08:18.080 --> 08:20.880]  But I told you, I said, I saw folks that didn't look like
[08:20.880 --> 08:23.160]  meth head Antifa on the videos.
[08:23.160 --> 08:25.280]  I got there about 30 minutes after it started
[08:25.280 --> 08:29.080]  to the Capitol, that looked like right wingers.
[08:29.080 --> 08:31.400]  You know, that didn't look like they'd been grown
[08:31.400 --> 08:33.360]  in their mother's basement.
[08:33.360 --> 08:36.000]  Looked like that actually had some steak and potatoes
[08:36.000 --> 08:37.200]  and done real fighting.
[08:39.280 --> 08:42.160]  And sure as hell, we identified who they were.
[08:42.160 --> 08:44.160]  They were telling the crowd, they were proud boys,
[08:44.160 --> 08:46.600]  but I checked them, they weren't proud boys.
[08:46.600 --> 08:48.160]  They were boogaloo's.
[08:49.160 --> 08:51.920]  We've got a whole bunch of their Facebooks
[08:51.920 --> 08:53.640]  and their Twitters and their admissions
[08:53.640 --> 08:55.520]  of how they planned it and what they did.
[08:55.520 --> 08:57.040]  And they're a left wing group
[08:57.040 --> 08:58.880]  that works with Black Lives Matter.
[08:58.880 --> 09:00.480]  They call themselves accelerationists.
[09:00.480 --> 09:02.400]  They won a civil war.
[09:02.400 --> 09:05.800]  So we also have that main contingent
[09:05.800 --> 09:08.960]  that broke through with Antifa.
[09:11.000 --> 09:14.520]  And it's just so incredible because you try to get this out.
[09:14.520 --> 09:16.120]  The only place that gets out is here.
[09:16.120 --> 09:17.880]  It's got an article about it, you name it,
[09:17.880 --> 09:20.880]  but now it's very clear what went on and what happened.
[09:22.320 --> 09:24.920]  But let's hit the first big one I just told you about.
[09:26.120 --> 09:27.160]  You can bet your bottom dollar,
[09:27.160 --> 09:28.960]  you'll be seeing this on Tucker Carlson tomorrow night
[09:28.960 --> 09:31.480]  because Tucker's the first one to send it to me.
[09:31.480 --> 09:33.240]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[09:33.240 --> 09:35.760]  But those that are in fight club,
[09:35.760 --> 09:36.840]  don't talk about flight club.
[09:36.840 --> 09:38.080]  You know, the second rule of fight club,
[09:38.080 --> 09:39.040]  don't talk about fight club,
[09:39.040 --> 09:41.240]  but I sent him stuff, he sends me stuff.
[09:41.240 --> 09:42.600]  This comes in, but then again,
[09:42.600 --> 09:44.480]  it starts coming in from everybody,
[09:44.480 --> 09:46.480]  which you know is going to mega viral when,
[09:46.480 --> 09:48.640]  you know, 10 people in an hour tell you about something.
[09:48.640 --> 09:51.040]  Your phone's ringing, they're not just texting you.
[09:52.320 --> 09:54.440]  And here he is, the Q Shaman,
[09:54.440 --> 09:57.640]  who I think is a well-meaning person,
[09:58.440 --> 09:59.760]  because the Q folks were the ones
[09:59.760 --> 10:01.240]  that just went in there and everything was fine
[10:01.240 --> 10:02.920]  and they weren't really violent.
[10:02.920 --> 10:06.120]  They were sucked in by the Boogaloo's and Antifa,
[10:06.120 --> 10:07.880]  but they were the photo op people.
[10:09.560 --> 10:12.120]  And so here comes the Q Shaman that we had on last week.
[10:12.120 --> 10:14.120]  He's in jail right now, he diverges to be happy.
[10:14.120 --> 10:15.560]  We should pay his bail.
[10:15.560 --> 10:17.280]  He was nonviolent.
[10:17.280 --> 10:20.400]  Hell, when Antifa or BLM take over buildings
[10:20.400 --> 10:22.920]  or police stations or burn them down, it's called good.
[10:22.920 --> 10:25.120]  I mean, the Q Shaman doesn't deserve to be in jail.
[10:27.160 --> 10:29.840]  I want to talk to him when Biden's in on Wednesday afternoon
[10:29.840 --> 10:32.400]  and see if he can get through his brainwashing
[10:32.400 --> 10:34.480]  of the pacification network to QS
[10:34.480 --> 10:35.480]  to make you not take action,
[10:35.480 --> 10:37.320]  but I'm done talking about that for now.
[10:38.400 --> 10:42.520]  The footage you're about to see is on infowars.com.
[10:42.520 --> 10:43.560]  I hope you share it there,
[10:43.560 --> 10:45.480]  because they'll probably pull it off Twitter,
[10:45.480 --> 10:48.080]  but it's just now being uploaded.
[10:48.080 --> 10:53.080]  Hours ago on Twitter of the Q Shaman coming in
[10:53.440 --> 10:54.560]  with three or four other people,
[10:54.560 --> 10:56.160]  one guy's been shot in the face of rubber bullets
[10:56.160 --> 10:57.600]  for no reason.
[10:57.600 --> 11:02.200]  And when the cop asked him to leave,
[11:02.200 --> 11:04.160]  there's more video came up, they left.
[11:05.040 --> 11:06.400]  Get a photo up and left.
[11:06.400 --> 11:09.600]  This is the insurrection, the armed insurrection,
[11:09.600 --> 11:12.720]  as bad as Pearl Harbor and all you got is four dead citizens
[11:12.720 --> 11:15.080]  in a cop that died of a heart attack two days later.
[11:17.360 --> 11:19.360]  Ashley Babbitt shot in the face, all of it.
[11:19.360 --> 11:21.960]  And this is why they have arm checkpoints
[11:21.960 --> 11:23.320]  around the Capitol and fences
[11:23.320 --> 11:26.440]  and hundreds of armored vehicles and F-16 wings
[11:26.440 --> 11:29.720]  and all of it because of what we're about
[11:29.720 --> 11:30.560]  to supposedly show you.
[11:30.560 --> 11:34.440]  So understand over a hundred antifa
[11:34.440 --> 11:38.460]  with over 50 boogaloo's broke through,
[11:38.460 --> 11:40.680]  gave people weapons, tried to provocateur them.
[11:40.680 --> 11:42.520]  We have new footage that I forgot to tell you guys,
[11:42.520 --> 11:43.640]  Gateway Pundit has it.
[11:43.640 --> 11:44.920]  Remember when we showed what we thought
[11:44.920 --> 11:47.200]  it was antifa handing weapons out through the window?
[11:47.200 --> 11:48.320]  No, it was boogaloo's.
[11:48.320 --> 11:50.760]  And when we have the cops letting the boogaloo's
[11:50.760 --> 11:52.480]  go back out through the window.
[11:55.080 --> 11:56.840]  So we have it all, folks.
[11:56.840 --> 12:00.360]  We have the total anatomy of how this false flag worked
[12:00.360 --> 12:01.960]  and then in come the Q people
[12:05.000 --> 12:06.320]  staying in the velvet ropes,
[12:06.320 --> 12:07.280]  doing what the police tell them
[12:07.280 --> 12:08.920]  and they all get arrested.
[12:08.920 --> 12:13.080]  All the boogaloo's and the antifa scurry off to safety.
[12:13.080 --> 12:13.920]  We have it all.
[12:13.920 --> 12:15.160]  If you're a radio listener,
[12:15.160 --> 12:17.400]  we're sitting out streams at Bandod video
[12:17.400 --> 12:19.080]  and in FortWars.com for us to show them.
[12:19.080 --> 12:21.000]  We're actually showing you every exhibit
[12:21.000 --> 12:22.840]  that we are laying out here.
[12:22.840 --> 12:25.480]  They get a few people all fired up in the mob
[12:25.480 --> 12:26.520]  and my telly to come in that we're just
[12:26.520 --> 12:27.960]  rather dumpsporters, absolutely.
[12:27.960 --> 12:30.120]  But hundreds of thousands were outside
[12:30.120 --> 12:33.280]  and the media showed you a few violent things inside
[12:33.280 --> 12:35.800]  and a woman being killed inside by the police,
[12:35.800 --> 12:38.840]  by the feds and then said that the entire mob
[12:38.840 --> 12:41.320]  was attacking and that's a scary image.
[12:41.320 --> 12:43.480]  Arch typally, a couple hundred thousand people
[12:43.480 --> 12:44.520]  come in to attack you.
[12:44.520 --> 12:48.560]  That is a arch typal instinctive memory
[12:48.560 --> 12:51.320]  of anybody that's had ancestors that went through it
[12:51.320 --> 12:53.480]  and so you see it as a threat.
[12:53.480 --> 12:55.280]  I got there and they said they breached the Capitol
[12:55.280 --> 12:56.320]  and I saw hundreds of thousands.
[12:56.320 --> 12:57.800]  I thought, somebody's gonna get killed.
[12:57.800 --> 12:58.800]  Stop this now.
[12:58.800 --> 13:02.600]  But 99% plus did not go in.
[13:02.600 --> 13:07.240]  To divide out of 200,000 conservatively, 200 that went in.
[13:07.240 --> 13:09.160]  I mean, that's maximum.
[13:09.160 --> 13:11.040]  So here, ladies and gentlemen,
[13:13.040 --> 13:15.520]  is the video of the Q Shaman and a few others
[13:15.520 --> 13:17.240]  coming in peacefully to the Capitol
[13:17.240 --> 13:18.800]  and then they talk a few minutes
[13:18.800 --> 13:21.800]  and they leave when one cop asked them to.
[13:21.800 --> 13:24.440]  One cop that did not stand down.
[13:24.440 --> 13:25.840]  We need a four year thing on this.
[13:25.840 --> 13:27.080]  One cop did his job.
[13:27.080 --> 13:28.040]  Uh, please leave.
[13:28.040 --> 13:29.680]  Absolutely, sir, we'll leave.
[13:29.680 --> 13:30.840]  Here it is.
[13:30.840 --> 13:31.680]  Hey.
[13:32.960 --> 13:34.920]  Hey, man.
[13:34.920 --> 13:36.040]  Glad to see you guys.
[13:36.040 --> 13:37.200]  That guy's a f***ing Patriots.
[13:37.200 --> 13:38.040]  Look at this guy.
[13:38.040 --> 13:38.880]  He's got covered in blood.
[13:38.880 --> 13:40.560]  God bless you.
[13:40.560 --> 13:42.040]  Yes.
[13:42.040 --> 13:42.880]  You good, sir?
[13:42.880 --> 13:43.720]  Do you need a medical attention?
[13:43.720 --> 13:44.560]  I'm good.
[13:44.560 --> 13:45.400]  Thank you.
[13:45.400 --> 13:46.240]  All right.
[13:47.520 --> 13:48.680]  I got shot in the face.
[13:48.680 --> 13:50.520]  Where are you?
[13:50.520 --> 13:53.240]  I got shot in the face with some kind of plastic bullet.
[13:53.240 --> 13:56.160]  Any chance I could get you guys to leave the Senate wing?
[13:56.160 --> 13:57.000]  We will.
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.080]  I've been making sure that I didn't disrespect the place.
[13:59.080 --> 13:59.920]  Okay.
[13:59.920 --> 14:00.760]  I just want to let you guys know.
[14:00.760 --> 14:02.200]  This is like the state for this place.
[14:02.200 --> 14:06.360]  God, I know it.
[14:06.360 --> 14:08.360]  Amen.
[14:08.360 --> 14:10.280]  For this opportunity to stand up for our God
[14:10.280 --> 14:12.080]  given on the illegal rights.
[14:12.080 --> 14:13.680]  Thank you, heavenly Father, for...
[14:13.680 --> 14:17.720]  So he says a prayer, thanks to the police, and they leave.
[14:17.720 --> 14:20.120]  And now all these videos are coming out.
[14:20.120 --> 14:25.400]  This is the most bloody insurrection in world history,
[14:25.400 --> 14:27.800]  bigger than World War II, bigger than Lenin,
[14:27.800 --> 14:31.440]  bigger than Stalin, bigger than Mao, bigger than Hitler.
[14:31.440 --> 14:35.120]  This is the ultimate insurrection of the New Pearl Harbor.
[14:35.120 --> 14:37.280]  And then there's more videos posted in boards.com.
[14:37.280 --> 14:39.720]  They leave, because one cop asked them to.
[14:41.720 --> 14:44.800]  Meanwhile, a few people believe they were on a mission for Q
[14:44.800 --> 14:46.440]  went into deeper areas of the Senate
[14:46.440 --> 14:48.160]  where the vice president was,
[14:48.160 --> 14:51.440]  and that's why Anne Schumer, and that's why they killed him.
[14:51.440 --> 14:53.120]  Killed the lady, but it's wrong, it's terrible,
[14:53.120 --> 14:54.320]  they killed her, it's wrong.
[14:54.320 --> 14:56.800]  Led by the anti-fuck commander
[14:56.800 --> 15:01.800]  who said he would lead them into this
[15:03.400 --> 15:06.640]  with a hundred anti-fuck dressed as Trump supporters,
[15:06.640 --> 15:10.040]  but they, again, couldn't have done it without the Q people
[15:10.040 --> 15:13.000]  who were just all jolly in there to say prayers
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.400]  and there to declare the storm was here.
[15:15.400 --> 15:17.440]  But the one Q lady, Ashley Mabbitt,
[15:17.440 --> 15:19.720]  she was all hyped up, she had to get in there,
[15:19.720 --> 15:21.440]  she had to do the citizens arrest, she had to,
[15:21.440 --> 15:24.240]  ah, I mean, she was screaming and yelling,
[15:24.240 --> 15:26.400]  breaking through a barricaded up doors,
[15:26.400 --> 15:27.840]  and they killed her.
[15:27.840 --> 15:30.400]  And it's terrible she died, but that's it.
[15:30.400 --> 15:32.240]  The most deadly attack in world history
[15:32.240 --> 15:34.440]  is an unarmed woman screaming.
[15:34.440 --> 15:36.320]  And now the heroes killed her,
[15:36.320 --> 15:38.960]  and there's 30,000 troops and hundreds of armored vehicles
[15:38.960 --> 15:41.320]  and F-16 wings.
[15:41.320 --> 15:43.760]  And the whole nation's going under martial law
[15:43.760 --> 15:47.040]  because a woman broke glass on a window and screamed.
[15:47.040 --> 15:48.400]  That's the end of America,
[15:48.400 --> 15:49.680]  the end of the First Amendment.
[15:49.680 --> 15:52.400]  CNN saying take down Fox News,
[15:52.400 --> 15:54.080]  take down OAN Newsmax,

[18:14.480 --> 18:18.760]  want to bankrupt the economy. It's why they want to destroy the infrastructure of this
[18:18.760 --> 18:23.920]  nation because they want all of us on our knees so they can dictate our surrender to

[20:06.800 --> 20:33.400]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones. Everything is coming to
[20:33.400 --> 20:39.320]  a head. Good and evil are battling it out across the planet. In the skies and on the
[20:39.320 --> 20:44.920]  ground, it's all unfolding and we have come so far against the new order. The global government
[20:44.920 --> 20:48.760]  reset wanting to make you poor, wanting to make you sick, wanting to make you dead is
[20:48.760 --> 20:52.880]  out in the open. That's coming up next hour. It's, oh hey, yeah, we are using this to make
[20:52.880 --> 20:57.320]  you poor. It's good. We are going to change your genetics. You have no right. We are going
[20:57.320 --> 21:03.920]  to inject you and change your very DNA. It is incredible. Mainstream news is just telling
[21:03.920 --> 21:09.000]  everything now. Overwhelming you to get you to give up. We are not going to give up. We
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.320]  have been proven right. This is authoritarian. We are going to fight back. They are not going
[21:12.320 --> 21:16.880]  to break our will. We are going to fight back not with deadly poison vaccines, not with
[21:16.880 --> 21:20.960]  chemtrails, not with pedophilia, not with all the aggressive new order that the globalists
[21:20.960 --> 21:25.680]  attack us with, but with love and justice and freedom and boycotts and civil disobedience
[21:25.680 --> 21:32.120]  and promoting the truth and free speech. So if you just joined us, this video is going
[21:32.120 --> 21:38.040]  viral. It's up on infowars.com. It's also on nationalfile.com. They actually had it before
[21:38.040 --> 21:41.480]  even Tucker Carlson sent it to me. This just broke like three hours ago. It's already up
[21:41.480 --> 21:47.720]  to almost a million views. I checked it during the break. Literally one cop asked Q Shaman
[21:47.720 --> 21:58.240]  protesters to leave the Senate on January 6th and he was successful three minutes later.
[21:58.240 --> 22:03.080]  Did you hear that? So they had hundreds of thousands of people there. Trump said go to
[22:03.080 --> 22:06.480]  the Capitol, be peaceful. None of the media shows you that. They couldn't hear Trump's
[22:06.480 --> 22:10.400]  speech. There was over a million people. Hundreds of thousands came to the Capitol. They're
[22:10.400 --> 22:15.200]  there. Antioch was already there in the morning before Trump even spoke, starting a fight.
[22:15.200 --> 22:22.040]  Things from all and half away. They begin to attack and then the Boogaloo's, which again
[22:22.040 --> 22:27.680]  are quote, right wing, but they're against the Proud Boys and they want a civil war.
[22:27.680 --> 22:31.640]  Posing as them, they then come and attack and hand out weapons and knock the few cops
[22:31.640 --> 22:36.760]  down that had been had their numbers cut that day. They've been told to be on traffic control
[22:36.760 --> 22:43.360]  around the city. And so we're talking 20, 30 riot cops get overrun by the anti fund
[22:43.360 --> 22:46.720]  by the Boogaloo's and then the crowd of hundreds of thousands doesn't know what's going on,
[22:46.720 --> 22:51.440]  but we have all the videos of patriots beating up anti fund and Boogaloo's not letting them
[22:51.440 --> 22:56.960]  get here. But it didn't matter. Once the doors were open, the people went in a few hundred.
[22:56.960 --> 23:02.480]  They followed the velvet ropes. A few agitators knocked out windows into the Senate and House
[23:02.480 --> 23:06.920]  to get the images of the feds pointing guns at him. One woman got shot. Few others had
[23:06.920 --> 23:12.400]  heart attacks. But that's what happened. You go to a football game with 100,000 people.
[23:12.400 --> 23:16.200]  There might be two or three deaths every time from heart attacks or or getting stumbled
[23:16.200 --> 23:21.840]  over or the or the championship happens and 20 cars get burnt and 60 something businesses
[23:21.840 --> 23:25.800]  get broken into. I mean, you've seen it. You'll hear about seven deaths last night when such
[23:25.800 --> 23:30.800]  and such won the NBA championship or God forbid there be a soccer championship in Europe.
[23:30.800 --> 23:35.760]  I have whole cities hundreds dead. Is it the end of the world? They had yellow vest demonstrations
[23:35.760 --> 23:41.680]  for over a year. Hundreds dead. That's a non issue. America's over. Free speech is over.
[23:41.680 --> 23:46.960]  They may convict Trump in the Senate with the impeachment going forward. They're talking
[23:46.960 --> 23:52.560]  about kicking Senator Cruz and Senator Holly out saying they're seditious because they
[23:52.560 --> 23:56.840]  challenged the elections in the Constitution. Some Democrats did four years ago. This is
[23:56.840 --> 24:02.680]  insane. All based on what Chuck Schumer calls a new Pearl Harbor as bad as Pearl Harbor.
[24:02.680 --> 24:07.840]  What four citizens died and then one cop from Heart Attack two days later. I mean, this
[24:07.840 --> 24:14.360]  is crazy. You have riots when somebody wins the game. All these deaths. That's no big deal.
[24:14.360 --> 24:18.360]  You had millions of migrants funded by the UN three years ago breaking across our border.
[24:18.360 --> 24:23.240]  In some cases, hundreds dying a day in the process. Police and migrants and that was
[24:23.240 --> 24:30.920]  all not a big deal. We had members of the Democratic Party like Gerald Nadler saying
[24:30.920 --> 24:40.080]  anti foot doesn't exist. Ladies and gentlemen, but oh, this is the biggest thing in the world.
[24:40.080 --> 24:44.040]  This was white supremacist attacking trying to burn down the US Capitol. But it was a
[24:44.040 --> 24:49.400]  known anti foot leader who's been arrested but now released without bail. Who was inside
[24:49.400 --> 24:55.120]  leading and saying burn everything down, but he failed. So let's go over here is the goofy
[24:55.120 --> 25:02.240]  guy, you know, with the bison horns on his head that was nonviolent. Maybe he gets a
[25:02.240 --> 25:06.640]  trespassing ticket 500 bucks. Maybe he does a week of community service. No, he's still
[25:06.640 --> 25:11.480]  in jail. Last time I heard he's charged all sorts of evil. Here he is walking into the
[25:11.480 --> 25:16.520]  Senate. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah. Then the cop says, will you please leave? A few minutes
[25:16.520 --> 25:17.600]  later, he does. Here it is.
[25:17.600 --> 25:28.040]  I just see you guys guys. Look at this guy's got covered in blood. God bless you. Yes.
[25:28.040 --> 25:35.240]  You good, sir? Do you need medical attention? I'm good. Thank you. All right. I got shot
[25:35.240 --> 25:41.360]  in the face. I got shot in the face with some kind of plastic bullet. Any chance I could
[25:41.360 --> 25:45.760]  get you guys to leave the Senate? We will. I've been making sure they disrespect in the
[25:45.760 --> 25:52.280]  place. Okay, just want to let you guys know this is like the sacredest place. It's sacred.
[25:52.280 --> 25:56.200]  And so it's the will of the people, right? And a few minutes later, another does or so
[25:56.200 --> 26:00.280]  show up at the one cops able to leave.
[26:00.280 --> 26:06.720]  So you just saw the most deadly attack in US history. You just saw something bigger than
[26:06.720 --> 26:11.040]  the Trojan War, bigger than World War Two, bigger than World War One, bigger than Civil
[26:11.040 --> 26:18.560]  War. You just saw why America has to end. Okay, now let's get serious. DC Coroner still
[26:18.560 --> 26:25.080]  doesn't know why people died on January 6 even as Congress claims deaths caused by protest.
[26:25.080 --> 26:29.840]  One was the cops shooting somebody. All the rest were heart attacks and strokes. Outrage
[26:29.840 --> 26:33.680]  that for 10 days, we still don't know very little about the deaths of four Trump supporters
[26:33.680 --> 26:44.280]  US Capitol. Why is that? And it goes on from there. But let's play this next over 7000
[26:44.280 --> 26:50.200]  strong migrant caravan inches closer to the US border as Biden vows to end Trump asylum.
[26:50.200 --> 26:53.840]  And this will be hundreds of thousands of millions like hit Europe. It's the UN plan.
[26:53.840 --> 26:58.400]  As soon as they knew Biden would let him in, they began the march out of a UN camp in Honduras
[26:58.400 --> 27:02.640]  into Guatemala. Here it is.
[27:02.640 --> 27:07.840]  These in Central America have ramped up their border controls as thousands of migrants from
[27:07.840 --> 27:13.440]  Honduras and Guatemala are heading to the US for a new life. The region is reeling from
[27:13.440 --> 27:18.800]  a growing hunger crisis after hurricanes hit as well as violence and lockdown measures
[27:18.800 --> 27:25.560]  that disrupted the job markets. On Friday, the first migrant caravan of the year departed
[27:25.560 --> 27:31.680]  Honduras. Small skirmishes broke out between Honduran security forces and migrants at the
[27:31.680 --> 27:38.280]  border with Guatemala as night fell. But groups of migrants continue to trickle past the border,
[27:38.280 --> 27:43.400]  even as Guatemala military detained hundreds of migrants, including many families with
[27:43.400 --> 27:50.800]  young children. Guatemalan officials estimate around 6500 people to be heading north to
[27:50.800 --> 27:59.680]  the US. Dora Centres is one of them. We just want a chance to work. We are defeated. We
[27:59.680 --> 28:01.680]  have nothing.
[28:01.680 --> 28:07.840]  What did I tell you 10, 11 months ago, about 5,000 times like a crazy parrot on methamphetamines.
[28:07.840 --> 28:13.200]  The UN is collapsing the third world with COVID lockdowns, not letting them grow flowers
[28:13.200 --> 28:17.680]  that we buy in the markets out of Latin America, Africa, UNEM, and not letting us buy food,
[28:17.680 --> 28:21.440]  vegetables, grains. They're going to come here when it collapses and the UN is going
[28:21.440 --> 28:25.400]  to run it. Then the UN is going to organize the global crisis out of this and drive down
[28:25.400 --> 28:29.800]  wages here in the United States and Europe. It's all an admitted plan. Claude Schwab decades
[28:29.800 --> 28:34.560]  ago wrote the proposals. That's why he was brought in as a scientist to head it up. He's
[28:34.560 --> 28:40.240]  a high tech general running this attack. War doesn't look like it did in Vietnam or Korea
[28:40.240 --> 28:45.640]  or the Gulf War. This is modern war. This is globalist war against the nation state.
[28:45.640 --> 28:50.520]  So wear your mask and take your vaccines and roll over and die. But remember this, submission
[28:50.520 --> 28:55.840]  only makes it worse. This is the end of America. In the next two years, the country will not
[28:55.840 --> 28:56.920]  exist. Guarantee.
[28:56.920 --> 29:10.920]  Q is a Bolshevik operation. Q is a relaunch of operation trust that the Soviets used in
[29:10.920 --> 29:15.960]  the 1920s to identify who their opposition was. That's when George Arwell wrote 1984
[29:15.960 --> 29:21.080]  that was about a futuristic, Stalinistic world government system. He talked about Emmanuel
[29:21.080 --> 29:26.680]  Goldstein, who was the supposed leader of the resistance, but really worked for the controllers
[29:26.680 --> 29:31.840]  to be able to identify anyone that was a dissident. That's what's happening. So the storm of Q
[29:31.840 --> 29:37.840]  is real. It's a globalist martial law takeover of America. I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen,
[29:37.840 --> 29:41.800]  but you have been had. I was suspicious of it, knew what it was early on and did not
[29:41.800 --> 29:48.240]  realize it was the main thrust. The main thrust, the globalist takeover is Operation Trust 2.0.
[29:48.240 --> 29:53.240]  We're covering it all live on the air at infowarst.com and newswarst.com. We'll have reporters on
[29:53.240 --> 29:57.520]  the ground covering the inauguration of the Communist Chinese spy Biden. The globalists
[29:57.520 --> 30:00.280]  are planning false flags. We pray we can stop them.
[30:00.280 --> 30:03.280]  3, 2, 1, here we go.
[30:03.280 --> 30:06.240]  His back in stock has been sold out for over eight months. We couldn't get it because the
[30:06.240 --> 30:10.000]  lockdown pollen block is back in stock. Let me tell you a little bit about it. But the
[30:10.000 --> 30:13.840]  power of quail egg concentrate pollen block acts differently. The traditional antihistamines
[30:13.840 --> 30:17.720]  that was clinically studied to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms by helping to clear sinus
[30:17.720 --> 30:22.640]  passages and eating respiratory function. It's amazing. Folks absolutely love it. And
[30:22.640 --> 30:27.680]  again, France has been shut down, so we couldn't get it. Now a limited supply is back in stock,
[30:27.680 --> 30:34.200]  25% off at infowarst.com. Pollen block again is available in this one minute ad. I don't
[30:34.200 --> 30:38.080]  have time to tell you all about it, but believe me, I have really wanted it back in because
[30:38.080 --> 30:42.040]  it works naturally unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter that makes you all
[30:42.040 --> 30:47.360]  be speedy and irritable and gives you a headache. This is naturally occurring. It's the secret
[30:47.360 --> 30:52.520]  of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress. It's passed on somehow through their eggs
[30:52.520 --> 30:58.200]  to us. You chew up the pills. They taste great. It's available again infowarstore.com pollen
[30:58.200 --> 31:01.080]  block infowarstore.com.
[31:01.080 --> 31:06.400]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing
[31:06.400 --> 31:12.000]  with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[31:12.000 --> 31:18.280]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com. Studies have
[31:18.280 --> 31:24.240]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[31:24.240 --> 31:29.840]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction
[31:29.840 --> 31:36.320]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested
[31:36.320 --> 31:43.360]  that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[31:43.360 --> 31:49.520]  and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and
[31:49.520 --> 31:55.920]  calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for
[31:55.920 --> 32:24.920]  a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarstore.com.

[32:56.360 --> 33:03.880]  these sales right now at infowarstore.com while you're still can.
[33:03.880 --> 33:21.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's
[33:21.760 --> 33:32.880]  Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war. So now major news organizations
[33:32.880 --> 33:39.240]  that are completely in the hands of the globalists like info wars and others few pockets of resistance
[33:39.240 --> 33:45.300]  like to Carlson are going through the hours and hours of footage and putting it all together
[33:45.300 --> 33:54.680]  by timestamp that there were maybe 30 fights or so in the entrance to the capital and six
[33:54.680 --> 34:00.160]  or seven inside and it was anti with a smash the cop in the door. We know their name. They
[34:00.160 --> 34:06.240]  have been arrested. It was anti for led the attack. We know their name. John Sullivan.
[34:06.240 --> 34:12.800]  We know all this. It's coming out. And so it's surprising they couldn't get a crowd
[34:12.800 --> 34:16.600]  of hundreds of thousands like you see on that shot of your TV viewer credible footage to
[34:16.600 --> 34:21.900]  do more damage. It shows the incredible control of this crowd. And then all the footage we've
[34:21.900 --> 34:27.240]  got of patriots beating up anti for dressed up as patriots to stop them from entering
[34:27.240 --> 34:32.320]  the building. So I showed up 30 minutes into this and told people don't go in. They're
[34:32.320 --> 34:39.960]  like, yeah, we know we're not going in. So everybody knows about the BOM people that
[34:39.960 --> 34:43.880]  have been arrested and the anti folks. It's more than 20. And we're talking leaders of
[34:43.880 --> 34:48.640]  it who bragged they were going there to attack the capital of blame Trump. He bragged on
[34:48.640 --> 34:54.720]  Twitter. He bragged everywhere. It's on record. His brother has come out and exposed him as
[34:54.720 --> 35:00.800]  planning this and he's in the news now. His brother is really upset. His dad is a three
[35:00.800 --> 35:10.640]  star general. Very interesting. So all of this is going on. And now we have the articles
[35:10.640 --> 35:19.600]  with the screenshots of the Boogaloo's bragging that they did all this. Wow. Wow. And we have
[35:19.600 --> 35:25.960]  the footage of it. We'll talk about this in just a moment. But first, ladies and gentlemen,
[35:25.960 --> 35:33.080]  let's look at 7000. They're telling you 7000 migrants from a UN center in Honduras coming
[35:33.080 --> 35:36.960]  across the Guatemalan border where they mass them, they prepare them, they brainwash them.
[35:36.960 --> 35:40.600]  They politically tell them go to the US. They tell them what the safe houses are. They're
[35:40.600 --> 35:47.560]  mainly military aged men. They bring women up and children up the front. And they open
[35:47.560 --> 35:51.880]  up these giant invasion corridors just like 3 million, 4 million Muslims last few years
[35:51.880 --> 35:56.440]  got into Europe. Then the government says if you want your universal income, you got
[35:56.440 --> 36:01.760]  to house these people in your home. It's all about the drop down wages, breakdown society.
[36:01.760 --> 36:07.680]  We have more troops than we have in the Middle East right now in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in
[36:07.680 --> 36:14.000]  Syria, in Israel, in Egypt, in all the Middle East. There's not even 10,000 troops. There's
[36:14.000 --> 36:20.280]  close to 30,000 troops. As of last night, I checked the numbers, there were 28,000 US
[36:20.280 --> 36:38.680]  troops in Washington, DC, more than 100 armored vehicles, more than 400 armored Humvees, a
[36:38.680 --> 36:45.320]  wing of F-16 fighters. And the whole town's under martial law. The bridges are locked
[36:45.320 --> 36:48.520]  down. They're blocking the bridges starting tomorrow out of Virginia and Maryland. I mean,
[36:48.520 --> 36:53.720]  that's martial law for nothing. For Trump, knowing his crowds are peaceful, hey, he
[36:53.720 --> 36:57.600]  just had the big crowd in front of him, march down there, be peaceful. Trump Jr. said it
[36:57.600 --> 37:02.920]  as well. And let them know that we are the majority and we know this was election fraud.
[37:02.920 --> 37:05.960]  They want to change the subject from all the evidence of election fraud that's totally
[37:05.960 --> 37:17.600]  confirmed now on to all of this. Simply disgusting. But I was outside the building while this
[37:17.600 --> 37:20.440]  was happening and I'm like, there's hundreds of thousands of people here. They've attacked
[37:20.440 --> 37:24.640]  the Capitol. I had no idea what's going on. It was no more than 150 people, most of them
[37:24.640 --> 37:36.600]  were peaceful, and a four of them got killed inside. So you think about that. There's close
[37:36.600 --> 37:45.200]  to 30,000 troops, hundreds of armored vehicles of different types, F-16s, everything in DC.
[37:45.200 --> 37:48.640]  Over anti-fu that came and attacked some cops, it made the riot police come out and attacked
[37:48.640 --> 37:53.740]  the general crowd. The general crowd kind of fought back, pushed up like mob mentality
[37:53.740 --> 37:58.200]  and then it was anti-fun, bug a loot that broke in and then they said, hey, trust the
[37:58.200 --> 38:05.960]  plan arrest Pelosi and the Q folks went in nonviolently as the useful idiots. So this
[38:05.960 --> 38:16.240]  is the martial law of the wall that is built right now in Washington, DC. There's a wall
[38:16.240 --> 38:20.040]  there for Congress. There's a wall around their gated neighborhoods, but you don't get
[38:20.040 --> 38:28.160]  a wall. After the UN, 10 months ago, 11 months ago, shuts down the third world. I mean, in
[38:28.160 --> 38:31.200]  Latin America and Africa, they couldn't even leave their houses for six months. People
[38:31.200 --> 38:36.360]  starved to death. Then they told them, oh, don't worry, we've got UN centers. It's not
[38:36.360 --> 38:40.560]  like I'm just saying this now. I told you hundreds of times, hundreds, that this is
[38:40.560 --> 38:45.640]  part of the great replacement, the great migration, the UN uses people as a weapon. They turn
[38:45.640 --> 38:49.280]  their food off, they turn their jobs off. You just think you're staying home for a few
[38:49.280 --> 38:55.920]  months and okay, it's a vacation. No, it's collapsing the border. When you become poor,
[38:55.920 --> 39:00.840]  the third world starves to death. When the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[39:00.840 --> 39:08.080]  How many times did I drill that into your head? And now in Europe and now in the US,
[39:08.080 --> 39:13.920]  everywhere, the borders are collapsing. And giant third world populations that don't have
[39:13.920 --> 39:20.640]  jobs and don't have infrastructures are coming here to do what? Collapse the infrastructure.
[39:20.640 --> 39:24.200]  First they get you to not go to work. Next they get you to say you're not essential.
[39:24.200 --> 39:28.560]  Next they shut down Main Street. Next they shut down the side streets. Then they come
[39:28.560 --> 39:33.840]  in and tell you that you've got to open your borders up because the third world's starving
[39:33.840 --> 39:38.280]  to death and mass, and then they get here and they're organized into political weapons
[39:38.280 --> 39:43.880]  and political groups that from the beginning were trained for up to a year in a UN refugee
[39:43.880 --> 39:53.360]  camp in Marxist, Leninist ideology, projected by Mark Zuckerberg, projected by Jeff Bezos,
[39:53.360 --> 39:58.600]  projected by all them on record commanding it while they're offshore and taxing them.
[39:58.600 --> 40:02.280]  And Communist China doesn't take one migrant. And Communist China has 3 million Muslims
[40:02.280 --> 40:06.440]  in death camps and a million Christians and Buddhists in death camps. And that's all okay.
[40:06.440 --> 40:15.560]  But we're supposed to open our borders up and take in tens upon tens of millions as
[40:15.560 --> 40:25.400]  the entire third world population is based on agriculture, mining, timber, and the big
[40:25.400 --> 40:36.520]  one, tourism. And now the tourism's gone. The tourism's gone in Africa. The tourism's
[40:36.520 --> 40:41.960]  gone in Latin America. The Caribbean is just shut down. You can't even get into most Caribbean
[40:41.960 --> 40:44.920]  islands if you want to fly down there and get some sun. Those people are just sitting
[40:44.920 --> 40:48.960]  there for 10, 12 months and they're saying, sorry, it's going to go on for years, but
[40:48.960 --> 40:55.440]  you can get on an airplane and fly to one of a dozen spots in North America and South
[40:55.440 --> 41:00.280]  America and Central America and more in that in Europe where the UN will give you a debit
[41:00.280 --> 41:05.840]  card. It's all in Reuters from George Soros with taxpayer money of $1,000 to $5,000 to
[41:05.840 --> 41:10.680]  get you into the U.S. And you're going to be allowed in. You're going to fly in. You're
[41:10.680 --> 41:16.960]  going to march in. You're going to do it all. And Joe Biden just said last week he said,
[41:16.960 --> 41:23.280]  I'm going to give amnesty to 11 million people. The day I get inaugurated, I'm signing the
[41:23.280 --> 41:27.520]  executive order. And then he said, and by the way, we're going to do another 20 million
[41:27.520 --> 41:31.920]  after that. And they opened up that UN Refugee Center because Trump had blocked it at the
[41:31.920 --> 41:36.080]  border and they hit us and hit us hard. And a lot of them are kidnapped children that
[41:36.080 --> 41:39.520]  are actually there in sex trade. And a lot of them are bringing in Coke and heroin and
[41:39.520 --> 41:42.960]  everything else, but it doesn't matter because this is a take down and a communist take down
[41:42.960 --> 41:47.840]  of America. The average dumbass is out there wearing their mask and glad that I'm going
[41:47.840 --> 41:51.240]  to go to work thinking, well, I'll just get another government check. When they're done
[41:51.240 --> 41:56.160]  with you, baby, you're going to be living on the street because this is the takeover.
[41:56.160 --> 42:00.760]  This is modern warfare using giant third world starving hordes that have been put in the
[42:00.760 --> 42:05.440]  position of starvation or invasion and the UN is going to manage with the left every damn
[42:05.440 --> 42:09.200]  bit of it. And they're going to swamp your red city. They're going to swamp your red
[42:09.200 --> 42:13.320]  town and they're going to take your ass over because you're under military attack. And
[42:13.320 --> 42:17.040]  they're shutting down all our communications. And now they're coming after your banking
[42:17.040 --> 42:21.920]  because you're under attack. Do you think I just came up here and told you all this
[42:21.920 --> 42:28.840]  was coming to lie to you? You think I like the FBI with magnifying glasses down my ass?
[42:28.840 --> 42:33.560]  You think I want to go to prison? Here's the difference. I will not be a liar. I will
[42:33.560 --> 42:38.480]  tell the truth. So all you men in America that like to polish your sports car and play
[42:38.480 --> 42:42.800]  golf and you think it's up to dumb men like me to be politically involved? Well, I've
[42:42.800 --> 42:47.960]  been protecting your ass. Well, guess what? All you little smarty pants, you know, yuppie
[42:47.960 --> 42:51.960]  men, you're all going to join the globalists and organize the migrants to control them
[42:51.960 --> 42:56.480]  against us. We know that. And so you are going to be the target of political retribution
[42:56.480 --> 43:03.600]  with the right back. Stay with us. Now is the time to get prepared. You got to pray
[43:03.600 --> 43:07.400]  to God and get your soul ready. You got to be prepared to physically defend yourself
[43:07.400 --> 43:12.360]  and your family. And you've also got to get things that allow you and your family to not
[43:12.360 --> 43:16.640]  be dependent on the system. That's why they want to bankrupt the economy. It's why they
[43:16.640 --> 43:21.480]  want to destroy the infrastructure of this nation because they want all of us on our
[43:21.480 --> 43:27.640]  knees so they can dictate our surrender to them. Info Wars is a critical organization
[43:27.640 --> 43:31.000]  in the fight against the globalist. And if you gave us straight up donations, that would

[43:59.120 --> 44:03.720]  while you still can. Hey, Alex, how you doing, man? Is this the guy that called in about
[44:03.720 --> 44:09.320]  living defense? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday
[44:09.320 --> 44:14.680]  when I heard you got that first shipment of living defense in from Utah. I said, man,
[44:14.680 --> 44:20.040]  I got to get on that show and give him an update. I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex
[44:20.040 --> 44:25.880]  Jones show, I'm going to tell the world about living defense and what it did for me personally.
[44:25.880 --> 44:32.280]  Now look, I'm 64 years old going on 20 thanks to the info for store products. And by the
[44:32.280 --> 44:38.080]  way, I bought $800 worth the other night. So I'm doing what I can, brother. So what
[44:38.080 --> 44:43.400]  my my convention is, why don't we start this new year off right with everybody getting
[44:43.400 --> 44:48.400]  a couple bottles of living defense. Now you got to follow that up with the micro v s.
[44:48.400 --> 44:53.400]  I learned that. So it's like God working is so amazing. We didn't know we didn't screen
[44:53.400 --> 44:57.960]  your call. We had no idea. And I go to you a year later and you're telling me about living
[44:57.960 --> 45:06.260]  defense, living defense, living defense. The resistance.video, the resistance.video, the
[45:06.260 --> 45:17.440]  resistance.video, the resistance.video, the resistance.video, the resistance.video, infowars.com,
[45:17.440 --> 45:24.600]  newswars.com, band.video, and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[45:24.600 --> 45:32.160]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it. But Soros and Bill Gates
[45:32.160 --> 45:41.040]  and the globalists are on our tail. But the new website is the resistance.video, the resistance.video.
[45:41.040 --> 45:45.760]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them. So the new
[45:45.760 --> 45:50.680]  URL that links right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[45:50.680 --> 45:55.680]  and all of the special reports and all of the suppressed information is at the resistance.video.
[45:55.680 --> 46:03.680]  Share the link. The resistance.video, the resistance.video.
[46:03.680 --> 46:07.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history. I've interviewed all the experts. I have
[46:07.320 --> 46:12.600]  looked at every facet of this. And now, the only days until the inauguration of the Chai
[46:12.600 --> 46:17.240]  Com agent, it's all coming into place. That's how they change the subject from election fraud.
[46:17.240 --> 46:21.680]  That's how they change the subject from Hunter's laptop. It's how they change the subject from
[46:21.680 --> 46:28.400]  Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda and the New World Order and now use the already martial
[46:28.400 --> 46:34.080]  law in place for COVID-19. And that's what it is, to then be expanded and become political
[46:34.080 --> 46:38.080]  and become permanent. They train you to stay in your houses. They train you to be tracked.
[46:38.080 --> 46:41.600]  They train and do what you're told for nine, 10 months as training wheels. And now they
[46:41.600 --> 46:47.360]  launch the storm. The storm is here. It's a globalist storm. There's not going to be
[46:47.360 --> 46:51.600]  martial law for Trump. There's going to be martial law for the globalist. They're trying
[46:51.600 --> 46:56.440]  to set you up. Don't be involved in violence. Expose the New World Order and expose the
[46:56.440 --> 47:22.440]  takeover with information. That's how we beat these people with truth.
[47:22.440 --> 47:30.840]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones. I told you this probably
[47:30.840 --> 47:34.760]  10,000 times and I'll tell you again, you're going to be here one day when the world government
[47:34.760 --> 47:41.280]  makes this move with lockdowns, martial law, forced inoculations, race war, false flags
[47:41.280 --> 47:47.880]  and now you're here. At least we knew it was coming. We know who's behind it, but there's
[47:47.880 --> 47:52.000]  so many flavors of information out there. Thousands of them. Most of them are people's
[47:52.000 --> 47:57.000]  own imaginations. The ancient Greeks thought that they didn't have their own imaginations.
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.400]  They thought that they were lusting out for somebody. It was Athena. They wanted to go
[48:00.400 --> 48:10.240]  to war. It was Mars. They wanted to build a sword. It was Festus or Vulcan. But imagine
[48:10.240 --> 48:14.480]  people today don't even know where their thoughts come from. They just sit there and allow themselves
[48:14.480 --> 48:19.080]  to be completely programmed. Well, I'm not about that. I have a motion once I intellectually
[48:19.080 --> 48:23.360]  scientifically decided what's really going on, what's pro-human, what's good for people,
[48:23.360 --> 48:27.800]  what works, what does God want, what does our basic genetic code say we should do. And
[48:27.800 --> 48:33.680]  then I emotionally promote that because that's what reaches people. It's not an act. I'm
[48:33.680 --> 48:38.360]  an emotional person. Emotional person having sex with my wife. Emotional person eating
[48:38.360 --> 48:45.440]  a plate of enchiladas or looking at a beautiful sunset or sunrise. What I'm getting at is
[48:45.440 --> 48:49.720]  you have to know yourself and control your mind and be aware of who you are or somebody
[48:49.720 --> 48:57.080]  else will control you. So let's get into it right now. Boogaloo Boy, leader who aligns
[48:57.080 --> 49:02.480]  with Black Lives Matter, both said about organizing arm and direction at U.S. Capitol
[49:02.480 --> 49:07.280]  at the time on Twitter because, you know, Twitter lets you do that. This is really a
[49:07.280 --> 49:12.840]  leftist group of accelerationists that are trying to demonize American gun owners and
[49:12.840 --> 49:17.760]  create this crisis. And they say they're Boogaloo Boy teams of an activated Virginia and we
[49:17.760 --> 49:23.360]  are currently have four fire teams inside the Capitol and seven more outside and we
[49:23.360 --> 49:28.480]  witnessed it and that is exactly who did it. And they would tell people they were proud
[49:28.480 --> 49:37.080]  boys, but they were allowed and footage we'll show you right now. After entering the Capitol,
[49:37.080 --> 49:41.000]  the police would turn their backs and allow them out because the police were told to stand
[49:41.000 --> 50:00.160]  down. Let's roll some of that B roll footage for TV viewers. And then meanwhile, Uber hides
[50:00.160 --> 50:07.320]  and featuring left wing activist. Yeah, let's just fit the audio out here. Charged in Capitol
[50:07.320 --> 50:16.120]  Riot, John Sullivan and his daddy, the three star general. He was featured in an Uber ad.
[50:16.120 --> 50:26.120]  He's such a little movie star. He's been arrested in other areas of the country. Staging events.
[50:26.120 --> 50:30.760]  Isn't daddy proud. But now they're trying to hide the ad. It's all the big corporations,
[50:30.760 --> 50:36.400]  all the big money. We're the resistance. They're the establishment. And so it's seeing in calls
[50:36.400 --> 50:40.320]  for citizen or competition and is joined by Facebook saying, Yeah, shut down OAN shut
[50:40.320 --> 50:47.720]  down Newsmax. They really mean shut you down. They already tried to shut us down. A news
[50:47.720 --> 50:52.400]  organization saying shut down their competition. And every time they say it, it magically happens
[50:52.400 --> 50:56.560]  to thousands of groups and people and Congress and Trump and the Republicans didn't defend
[50:56.560 --> 51:01.520]  us. But now they want Ted Cruz expelled. They want Josh Holly expelled. Oh, they'll be action
[51:01.520 --> 51:06.800]  now because now the establishment realizes they're set up. Senator Paul said to Mitch McConnell
[51:07.520 --> 51:13.600]  today, he said, if you go ahead with the trial of Trump, when he clearly did nothing,
[51:13.600 --> 51:16.880]  you'll destroy the Republican Party. And if you go ahead against Josh Holly,
[51:18.000 --> 51:23.600]  a senator and Cruz for still holding a vote as they said they would that's in the Constitution
[51:23.600 --> 51:29.840]  about the electors and the certification that day after the quote Pearl Harbor mass
[51:29.840 --> 51:35.440]  murder attack the biggest in US history, which it wasn't, then you will destroy the Republican
[51:35.440 --> 51:44.320]  Party. Hey, Senator Paul, I knew you back when you were campaigning for your daddy in 1995.
[51:44.320 --> 51:49.680]  You're a smart guy. But don't you figure it out yet? That's what Mitch McConnell's mission is,
[51:49.680 --> 51:54.480]  son. They're scared of the populism. They're scared of the nationalism. They're scared of the
[51:54.480 --> 52:00.320]  awakening and they want everything shut down. So you're not in business as usual, Paul.
[52:01.280 --> 52:07.200]  None of you are. You're in a war in a globalist takeover in the end of the Republic in a great
[52:07.200 --> 52:14.320]  reset shutdown. The Australians have said that. They were not joining the US with Joe Biden in
[52:14.320 --> 52:18.720]  the great reset to bankrupt our country for China under the coronavirus hoax. Well, really,
[52:18.720 --> 52:23.840]  you followed the hoax bigger than the other country. But see, the prime minister doesn't
[52:23.840 --> 52:30.000]  control the blue cities under Chinese control. And that's why Australia's fighting so hard because
[52:30.000 --> 52:36.320]  they've already lost. Unless they admit there's been a Chinese takeover, they have no hope. Pompeo
[52:36.320 --> 52:42.640]  came out today and he said, we're not in a cold war. China has basically taken over.
[52:44.320 --> 52:49.200]  The Australian prime minister has said the same. That's why this is happening.
[52:49.200 --> 52:54.080]  Julian Assange from prison said the Q movement is a pacification movement to make you think you're
[52:54.080 --> 52:58.400]  invincible and the Trump's invincible when Trump's in grave danger. And he was right a year ago.
[52:58.400 --> 53:04.080]  He was right last month and I was right as well. I'm not mad at you. You like Q. Q took on all the
[53:04.080 --> 53:08.560]  things that are real that we talk about, but made it where it was secret and esoteric. None of this
[53:08.560 --> 53:13.520]  is about being esoteric or being secret. It's about being out in the open. So I'm going to start
[53:13.520 --> 53:20.320]  the next hour. Videos arrested, suspected BLM agent revocateur at the Capitol.
[53:22.480 --> 53:27.840]  More videos coming out. Oh, look, even zero hedge is a great folks gets it wrong. Like,
[53:27.840 --> 53:33.280]  look at the, look at the proud boy, Boogaloo's don't even know the grip. Oh, look, they're wearing
[53:33.280 --> 53:40.080]  rainbow flags and black lives matter, anti for shirts. And they say that, oh, the proud boys
[53:40.080 --> 53:44.400]  are going to attack because this group is calling themselves the proud boys. My God,
[53:44.400 --> 53:49.120]  they're even wearing rainbow flags. So the cops know not to stop them and anti for outfits.
[53:49.120 --> 53:57.760]  And then even our own people go, look, look, it's the proud boys. They're going to blow up
[53:57.760 --> 54:06.720]  the Capitol on the 20th. And the dudes are anti for with rainbow flags on just incredible.
[54:06.720 --> 54:12.400]  Antifa militant leader arrested for plotting to murder Trump supporters during
[54:12.400 --> 54:21.360]  inauguration says he received Soros money. And now the FBI has to admit Patriots weren't planning
[54:21.360 --> 54:26.960]  to kill and murder people inside. They were set up. So we knew a false flag was coming. I thought
[54:26.960 --> 54:31.280]  they did in a truck bomber of a mass shooting and say that Patriots did it. Instead, they had
[54:31.280 --> 54:36.320]  Antifa and Boogaloo's lead the attack, which Twitter still lets them announce they've done.
[54:40.400 --> 54:41.360]  And the rest is history.
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.680]  So yeah, we stood up against election fraud. We walked into a trap. What are we supposed to just
[54:47.680 --> 54:52.880]  roll over? But you see, as Mark Twain said, a lie goes halfway around the world before the
[54:52.880 --> 54:59.760]  truth puts its pants on. But that's okay because the end truth is going to come out.
[54:59.760 --> 55:06.640]  And the globalists are going to get in major trouble. But boy, Facebook is announcing
[55:07.360 --> 55:12.560]  the banning of all self defense training, all body armor, all gun accessories,
[55:12.560 --> 55:16.560]  you knew it was coming. The state gets all the body armor, they get all the defense training,
[55:16.560 --> 55:25.440]  but you don't. And CNN calls along with Facebook for the removal of Newsmax and OAN off of the
[55:25.440 --> 55:31.760]  cable dial. And you know what's going to happen. And they say we can't let Americans organize
[55:31.760 --> 55:36.320]  before it was always for some made up reason. Now it's just we can't let America organize.
[55:36.320 --> 55:42.320]  And then Stelter has guests on going, there are lots of talk radio host and YouTube hosted
[55:42.320 --> 55:49.840]  a bigger audiences than us. Wow. Talk about racketeering. Talk about Sherman antitrust.
[55:49.840 --> 55:56.160]  Talk about monopolies. Talk about oligopolies. Talk about cartels. Talk about criminal activity.
[55:56.160 --> 56:02.160]  I mean, this is it. This isn't like creeping towards North Korea or lurching towards communist
[56:02.160 --> 56:10.080]  China or remembering Stalinist Russian or Hitler's Germany. This is the big 21st century American
[56:10.080 --> 56:17.280]  version. And it's all weird, disreputable creatures because that's all they can get
[56:17.280 --> 56:23.600]  because there's such virtue in humanity that no good looking, no well spoken, no honorable man
[56:23.600 --> 56:28.560]  will even serve this. But it still doesn't matter because just because honorable men don't take the
[56:28.560 --> 56:33.200]  field and don't join the enemy, the enemy goes great because you didn't join the fight. And the
[56:33.200 --> 56:37.680]  fight is informational. It's cultural. It's spiritual. And it's about boycotting. And it's
[56:37.680 --> 56:44.000]  about information war. And it is about noncompliance. It is about civil disobedience. And it won't
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.240]  matter. They're going to hurt you so bad because they have a nature like a child molester's got
[56:48.240 --> 56:53.440]  to rape a child or a murderer's got to kill. They just have this drive and this desire and
[56:53.440 --> 56:57.840]  they've got to have power over you and they got to inject you and they got to shut your farm down
[56:57.840 --> 57:01.920]  and they got to shut your business down and they've got to see their stock go up at Amazon
[57:01.920 --> 57:06.320]  and their stock and they've just got to do it and they just got to put you down. They can't help it.
[57:06.320 --> 57:14.320]  And they're going to go and go and go and go and go. They can't ever stop till you stop them.
[57:16.480 --> 57:21.760]  But they're such liars. Tucky Schumer and Nadler saying Antifa doesn't exist but oh
[57:21.760 --> 57:28.240]  the greatest attacks since Pearl Harbor thousands dead killed by Nazis. And all that was killed was
[57:29.040 --> 57:34.000]  a woman and people having heart attacks who came they thought to save America out of a million
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.000]  people that showed up. They had to be a hundred unhinged people. The police stood down open the
[57:38.000 --> 57:43.280]  door and did it all. But see big tech hopes you don't know the truth. They hope this doesn't get
[57:43.280 --> 57:46.160]  out but see we're here. We're still here thanks to you.
[57:50.560 --> 57:55.520]  I want to warn all patriots in the United States and across the world that listen to my voice.
[57:55.520 --> 58:00.960]  I'm Alex Jones. I've been in this fight 27 years and I studied every angle of their operations
[58:00.960 --> 58:07.760]  and I am here to tell you as clear as day. They have organizations on message boards and other
[58:07.760 --> 58:14.320]  groups posing as patriot leaders and posing as President Trump anonymously telling you to have
[58:14.320 --> 58:20.880]  our marches in all 50 states coming up on the 20th and before that you are being set up. I was there
[58:20.880 --> 58:27.120]  in DC with a million peaceful people and I watch Antifa and other leftist groups pose our people
[58:27.120 --> 58:32.800]  and set us up. Thank God the patriots did not engage in the rioting so only a few people did
[58:32.800 --> 58:39.840]  it so the thing was a misfire. It was a dud but the left is hungry to declare all Trump supporters
[58:39.840 --> 58:44.800]  terrorist and they're planning terrorist attacks and mass shootings on the 20th to blame the American
[58:44.800 --> 58:49.440]  people. Do not be part of it. We are peaceful. We are not violent.
[58:49.440 --> 58:56.480]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain many of the best selling
[58:56.480 --> 59:01.040]  products implores are no longer available and I thought that pollen block might be gone forever
[59:01.040 --> 59:07.280]  but after eight months we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us. The rest they

[1:00:15.360 --> 1:00:19.600]  i would never have done that they're all wrong those people voted the way you voted for who you
[1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:23.920]  voted for i'm just saying right but just because you vote for the same people doesn't mean that you
[1:00:23.920 --> 1:00:27.760]  believe the same thing but you're in the same crowd yes it does round two for the ultimate
[1:00:27.760 --> 1:00:35.200]  demonization of patriots begins roughly on january 16th as the fbi sets the stage tying the aims
[1:00:35.200 --> 1:00:41.280]  of real right-wing extremism to that of your average law-abiding america loving trump supporter
[1:00:41.280 --> 1:00:47.440]  the range of criminal conduct is really uh i think again unmatched in any type of scenario that we've
[1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:54.720]  seen the fbi or the doj we're looking at everything from simple trespass to theft of mail to theft of
[1:00:54.720 --> 1:01:00.560]  digital devices with inside the capital to assault on local officers federal officers
[1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:06.000]  feeding on america inside and inside the capital to the theft of potential national security
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:12.240]  information or national defense information to felony murder and even civil rights excessive
[1:01:12.240 --> 1:01:20.400]  force investigation so just the gamut of cases and we're looking at shaman walk in parade oh you
[1:01:20.400 --> 1:01:25.280]  killed a woman america was on fire and while thousands of central americans race towards
[1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:31.120]  biden's potentially wide open u.s border 12 foot walls are going up to replace the eight foot
[1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:36.560]  walls that were there before to keep americans out as the national mall resembles something
[1:01:36.560 --> 1:01:41.680]  straight out of a tin pot dictatorship where the government fears the people streets are being
[1:01:41.680 --> 1:01:49.840]  blocked off the capital locked down tensions are high polosi fronts a movement branding 75 million
[1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:57.360]  trump voters as neo-nazis simply because one idiot wore an offensive shirt oh so many disgusting
[1:01:57.360 --> 1:02:05.600]  images but one figure the george saras man in a shirt with oschwitz george saras it'll round up
[1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:15.200]  just them oschwitz to see this conch with that shirt on and his anti-semitism that he has bragged
[1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:24.720]  about to be part of a white supremacist raid on is he with a lc requires us to have an after
[1:02:24.720 --> 1:02:32.560]  action or to assign responsibility to those who are part of organizing it and incentivizing it
[1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:38.720]  and as thousands of national guard members prepare to protect the nation's capital from the nation
[1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:44.320]  i'm sure that amongst the ranks very few of those national guard have forgotten that just
[1:02:44.320 --> 1:02:50.960]  seven months ago they weren't welcome to protect the president from the marxist mob we don't think
[1:02:50.960 --> 1:02:56.480]  that soldiers should be in the nation's capital patrolling or policing streets we've made that
[1:02:56.480 --> 1:03:02.720]  formal request to the white house uh we have no desire to have any soldier out on the street so
[1:03:02.720 --> 1:03:07.200]  residents can't pay their bills so either the department of the army or their home states will
[1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:11.840]  have to take care of their arrangements mayor bowser came here to unveil this new black lives matter
[1:03:11.840 --> 1:03:16.880]  plaza sign the new name for 16th and age street outside the white house in lafayette square who's
[1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:23.600]  in charge what is the chain of command and by what authority wild polosi stands like a fascist
[1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:28.480]  dictator in front of the troops she called on to protect her country club and its members what
[1:03:28.480 --> 1:03:34.560]  transpires as we move forward toward biden's tyrannical inauguration will be a circus of
[1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:40.480]  radicalism and possible false flag operations in all 50 capitals of the united states late afternoon
[1:03:40.480 --> 1:03:46.320]  that texas state capital grounds were shut down to the public to quote unquote maintain public order
[1:03:46.320 --> 1:03:55.600]  dps austin police and highway patrol stood by carefully watching confrontations and verbal threats
[1:03:55.600 --> 1:04:00.080]  we're not a moral nation anymore we're done testers holding guns which is legal in texas
[1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:04.320]  ready and everything you got soon folks right now why did you bring that with you we're not here
[1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:08.640]  to start trouble we're actually just here to protect people and really just kind of scare them away
[1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:14.240]  hopefully without even having to use any force this would be an opportunity for all real trump
[1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:20.400]  supporters to stay home or risk handing the full weight of federal subjugation over to a democratic
[1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:28.000]  party desperate for a reason to reeducate and imprison god-fearing americans fdr was afraid
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:32.560]  the japanese had infiltrated the west coast even though the pentagon said it wasn't true
[1:04:33.200 --> 1:04:39.360]  he knew better and so he pushed through his policies and we made one of the one of the
[1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:45.760]  biggest mistakes of the 20th century by taking our own citizens and listen to this confiscating
[1:04:45.760 --> 1:04:52.720]  their wealth making sure they couldn't work shutting them down and then putting them in camps
[1:04:53.840 --> 1:05:01.600]  tucker this is the road we're on again john bound reporting now is the time to get prepared
[1:05:01.600 --> 1:05:06.080]  you got to pray to god get your soul ready you got to be prepared to physically defend yourself
[1:05:06.080 --> 1:05:11.680]  with your family you've also got to get things that allow you and your family to not be dependent
[1:05:11.680 --> 1:05:16.560]  on the system that's why they want to bankrupt the economy it's why they want to destroy the
[1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:21.840]  infrastructure of this nation because they want all of us on our knees so they can dictate our
[1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:27.040]  surrender to them in bull wars is a critical organization in the fight against the global
[1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:31.360]  extent if you gave us trade-up donations that would be great because our work is important

[1:06:20.320 --> 1:06:26.560]  live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:35.840]  so there is a paradox in human history that great liberty creates incredible wealth
[1:06:36.400 --> 1:06:41.040]  and then decadence and that rage corruption tyranny and then collapse and that's the cycle
[1:06:41.600 --> 1:06:49.840]  that many a philosopher even 2000 3000 years ago in what is Greece today and Rome later
[1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:56.240]  in Egypt understood so that's where we are but it doesn't make it any more dangerous what we're
[1:06:56.240 --> 1:07:02.560]  facing okay so we now know boogaloo groups working for the feds and ante been working for the
[1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:07.680]  democrats of the feds storm the capital got a few q people to follow them but the main groups are
[1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:11.520]  boogaloo's and ante thought we know their names we know their groups they took advantage of it
[1:07:11.520 --> 1:07:17.680]  they bragged they did it get hundreds of thousands outside didn't go in i mean it's easy to stamp
[1:07:17.680 --> 1:07:22.160]  Peter Crowder cause a riot look at you know any bar fight where people get to fight others
[1:07:22.160 --> 1:07:25.440]  you know trigger it that's not just in John Wayne movies where two guys get in the fight
[1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:28.880]  and suddenly the whole bar is fighting that's how that works it's a chain reaction
[1:07:30.880 --> 1:07:40.800]  but now we've got brian steltern and others coming out and saying with facebook executives
[1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:46.240]  hey we can't let any conservative or nationalist because they're so violent after the capital event
[1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:54.560]  that we can't let them have any voice or anywhere to talk and they go on in a long like hour long
[1:07:54.560 --> 1:07:58.400]  report we're playing a few minutes over here to say we just have to figure out how to reeducate them
[1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:05.440]  how do we deprogram them they love us so much i mean you know CNN covers up for three million
[1:08:05.440 --> 1:08:09.920]  muslims and death camps of china and a million christians and buddhist and then it covers up
[1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:16.720]  for apple and they cover for all the illegal wars and chemical weapons and you know brian steltern
[1:08:16.720 --> 1:08:21.520]  he's just up there like oh he's the good guy like how do we silence them for their own good
[1:08:22.160 --> 1:08:26.960]  we don't want oan and newsmax which are both milk toast i mean oh it's better than newsmax
[1:08:26.960 --> 1:08:32.640]  but give me a break it's everything they don't just like parlor trump might have gone oh oh
[1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:42.880]  trump might go to parlor well we'll just ban it it's gone this is an avalanche this is a stampede
[1:08:42.880 --> 1:08:51.120]  this is a foreign army hitler ended up losing in five years but he lined up against poland
[1:08:51.120 --> 1:08:56.480]  he lined up against shekel slovakia he lined up against austria he lined up against france
[1:08:56.480 --> 1:09:03.200]  he lined up and all of them fell quickly and finally there was a Winston Churchill like to
[1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:11.520]  say it or joseph stalin said no that's not going to happen and finally they were met with resistance
[1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:17.440]  can we just recognize we're in a takeover can we just recognize we're in an assault because if
[1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:21.520]  you don't do that you don't have a prayer the great news and i'll cover this coming up the bottom of
[1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:30.480]  the hour is australian tv national tv the prime minister is saying this is a un global government
[1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:35.200]  takeover using govind and we're not going to stand for the great reset well you just went along with
[1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:40.800]  the biggest lockdowns ever but it was his blue cities did it the australians are organizing
[1:09:40.800 --> 1:09:45.040]  now to say no they've had all these top ministers resigned saying it's all a fraud they have the
[1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:51.040]  statistics hell i hired a month ago a major statistician group but they had to sign an agreement
[1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:55.600]  not to say their name was all the demonized that does major work for national insurance companies
[1:09:55.600 --> 1:10:02.800]  and i said we've looked at the coveted deaths looks like 61 000 people extra died in 2020
[1:10:02.800 --> 1:10:07.120]  they're telling 300 000 and if you count population increase looks like there's actually less
[1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:12.480]  desperate capital this year 2020 than last year they came back to me later they said yeah that's
[1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:17.840]  exactly right in fact it's worse than you're saying we're going to present those numbers very soon
[1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:23.200]  we've been so busy we haven't released them yet because they're very voluminous but that's what the
[1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:31.120]  australian government high level national deputy finance head came out and said like i can't be part
[1:10:31.120 --> 1:10:39.120]  of this this is a lie it's not true they count all the pneumonia which is bad that's the big one
[1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:45.040]  folks it's not flu and all the flu and the car wrecks and the cancer and the heart attacks
[1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:49.600]  in the same damn column the average person that dies of coveted worldwide is 84 and a half years old
[1:10:50.320 --> 1:10:55.840]  they didn't die coveted folks they died of natural causes and they put coveted on the death certificate
[1:10:55.840 --> 1:11:00.320]  because worldwide because it's all run by the un and bill gates you get money when you say it's
[1:11:00.320 --> 1:11:07.920]  coveted but i'm digressing here it is seeing in calls on cable companies to remove newsmax and
[1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:14.240]  oan but it's worse than that it's the former executive at facebook calls for oan newsmax
[1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:18.160]  to be the platform so i don't want them to be the platform i love them they're great folks
[1:11:19.360 --> 1:11:25.280]  but remember info wars is there as well so when you tell people hey it's being the platform newsmax
[1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:30.720]  oan info wars band dot video don't be ashamed of that we're exploding right now but i want to
[1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:36.640]  explode to win i don't care about how big we are i want to explode to defeat them i want oan to be
[1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:42.480]  huge i want newsmax to be huge i want newsmax to be more hardcore but yes promote them but promote
[1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:47.920]  info wars dot com because it's the real fount of the resistance they're trying to get tucker off
[1:11:47.920 --> 1:11:54.720]  the air right now so look at these would-be dictators these slimy monsters up there with
[1:11:54.720 --> 1:12:01.600]  all their fake authority as a news organization that lies to you saying they want their competition
[1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:07.280]  taken off the air here it is we have to work on the broader disinformation problem to try to turn
[1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:13.680]  down the anger that you see from that pause again back this up they said three years ago that they
[1:12:13.680 --> 1:12:19.440]  weren't censoring when they took me off all those platforms it's double thing it's gas lining so wait
[1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:25.920]  it did remember remember none of this existed remember oh but now the election meddling does
[1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:32.800]  and now we've got to stop it we're the good little reeducation camp operatives and i mean think how
[1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:38.720]  sick this is they are engaged in soviet nazi level censorship but they're the good guys
[1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:43.920]  trying to stop the hate here it is we have to work on the broader disinformation problem
[1:12:43.920 --> 1:12:49.200]  to try to turn down the anger that you see from that huge percentage of republicans who believe
[1:12:49.200 --> 1:12:54.480]  that the election was stolen it's the you know that the biden denialism is very real and widespread
[1:12:54.480 --> 1:12:58.320]  so is riot denialism with people claiming that it was anti-fan all these other crazy
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:04.320]  laws again oh we had thousands of buildings burned down tens of billions of dollars of damage
[1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:09.520]  30 plus cops killed 20 plus i mean it was it was huge numbers they tried to cover it up
[1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:15.920]  you we have nadler saying anti-foot doesn't exist but hump the dump the brian stelter
[1:13:15.920 --> 1:13:20.960]  like a hundred thousand viewers he later bitches no one watches me well no kidding did you look
[1:13:20.960 --> 1:13:26.400]  like a child molester i'm not saying you are one but i mean i'm like you babysit my kids bro
[1:13:26.400 --> 1:13:30.560]  you molest the truth i'm sorry let's go back to them both are happening both are happening
[1:13:30.560 --> 1:13:35.600]  from the same platforms and the same pro-trump media outlets both are problematic um christ
[1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:39.920]  what do you say to the following we have to be clear-eyed about what is a domestic terror threat
[1:13:39.920 --> 1:13:45.360]  but also very careful not to exaggerate it not to run again we're on 10 seconds there's a domestic
[1:13:45.360 --> 1:13:50.480]  terror threat it's called your speech oh they killed four americans at the capital there's a
[1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:56.640]  riot a small riot it's the worst thing since pearl harbor but we got to be careful not to
[1:13:56.640 --> 1:14:02.000]  exaggerate it he plays all these games let's go back to this sack of pus christ what do you say
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:06.720]  to the following we have to be clear-eyed about what is a domestic terror threat but also very
[1:14:06.720 --> 1:14:12.880]  careful not to exaggerate it not to overstate it not to create undue fear uh in this country right now
[1:14:15.040 --> 1:14:19.440]  i think that's absolutely right we've got to be very careful here just just because someone may
[1:14:19.440 --> 1:14:25.360]  believe that uh the president did not win the election or the president-elect biden did not win
[1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:31.520]  or that someone believes in qanon doesn't mean that they're going to go pick up arms and pause again
[1:14:31.520 --> 1:14:36.000]  it's like we're outlawing them question the election we don't put them in the fema camp right away
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:39.760]  you see that's how you move the over some window like we kill them and put them in a fema camp oh
[1:14:39.760 --> 1:14:45.520]  we don't we just shut them down and then oh we kill them this is all psychological scripts they're
[1:14:45.520 --> 1:14:51.760]  reading super predatory super dangerous super evil continue is that possible ounce will there ever
[1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:57.600]  be a solution a real clear full solution to this information crisis that has been perpetuated in
[1:14:57.600 --> 1:15:03.360]  my view by platforms like it was the work phase is there a final solution he's asking like how do
[1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:08.800]  we deal with these people that like you know saw them with suitcases in georgia pulling them out
[1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:13.360]  and closing things and saying the water main broke and then all these boat by the votes come in and
[1:15:13.360 --> 1:15:18.880]  happen all you know hey and around biden can't get 20 people the trumpets a million but you know
[1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:22.800]  what do we do what's the solution we're going to come back i'm going to be nice i'm going to play
[1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:27.760]  the clip unedited because by edited i'm jumping in i'm talking over it's just it's hard to look
[1:15:27.760 --> 1:15:33.520]  at someone with no viewers but it doesn't matter it's what the banks they know that the globalist
[1:15:33.520 --> 1:15:39.440]  word is through stelter that's jeff zucker and so here is this this this this hitler the Stalin

[1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:14.560]  1920s to identify who their opposition was that's when george arwell wrote 1984 that was about a
[1:17:14.560 --> 1:17:20.320]  futuristic Stalinistic world government system he talked about a manual goldstein who was the
[1:17:20.320 --> 1:17:25.920]  supposed leader of the resistance but really worked for the controllers to be able to identify
[1:17:25.920 --> 1:17:31.360]  anyone that was a dissident that's what's happening so the storm of q is real it's a globalist

[1:21:01.760 --> 1:21:07.280]  over this morning and almost threw up it aired yesterday and i mean it's just them like yeah
[1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:12.640]  we just can't let conservatives or pay a republicans just have a voice we have to reeducate
[1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:17.040]  them so we have to get rid of every place they can talk and they're just i mean this is so
[1:21:17.040 --> 1:21:24.240]  so textbook 1984 and you're just watching these criminals talk about it but i'm not going to

[1:21:29.280 --> 1:21:34.640]  to shut up go ahead and we have to work on the broader disinformation problem to try to turn down
[1:21:34.640 --> 1:21:38.960]  the anger that you see from that huge percentage of republicans who believe that the election was
[1:21:38.960 --> 1:21:45.680]  stolen it's yeah that i'm sorry back at the start remember them saying we're not censoring you it's
[1:21:45.680 --> 1:21:53.360]  made up now it's like oh trump might go to parlor ban them off their servers ban everyone ban ban
[1:21:53.360 --> 1:22:00.400]  me but you can't even have body armor sold anywhere i mean it's like it's crazy how these crooks operate
[1:22:01.760 --> 1:22:08.320]  and it's all these weird creepy dudes like why do all of them look like the creepiest slimyest
[1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:12.960]  like if i was a Hollywood producer and i said i want to create a planet of slimy looking men
[1:22:12.960 --> 1:22:18.160]  and they'd say well sir what are you looking for brian stelter's guest we're gonna play like
[1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:23.520]  like i want to show disingenuous men that like i would teach my daughter if you see a man looks
[1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:29.920]  like this don't go anywhere near them these are fake frauds these are bad people these are scam artists
[1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:35.200]  and and just all of us so let's i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry go
[1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:43.200]  oh please lord help me uh go ahead and roll it go ahead we have to work on the broader
[1:22:43.200 --> 1:22:48.720]  disinformation problem to try to turn down the anger that you see from that huge percentage
[1:22:48.720 --> 1:22:53.360]  of republicans who believe that the election was stolen it's that you know that biden denialism is
[1:22:53.360 --> 1:22:58.240]  very real and widespread so is riot denialism with people claiming that it was anti-fan all
[1:22:58.240 --> 1:23:01.680]  these other crazy lies instead uh both are happening both are happening from the same
[1:23:01.680 --> 1:23:06.720]  platforms and the same pro-trump media outlets both are problematic um christ what do you say
[1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:11.360]  to the following we have to be clear-eyed about what is a domestic terror threat but also very
[1:23:11.360 --> 1:23:17.600]  careful not to exaggerate it not to overstate it not to create undue fear uh in this country right now
[1:23:19.760 --> 1:23:23.680]  i think that's absolutely right we've got to be very careful here just just by the way back
[1:23:23.680 --> 1:23:29.360]  that up five seconds i forgot and my boom operator pointed out this crab guy worked for trump and said
[1:23:29.360 --> 1:23:34.560]  there's no election fraud and got fired for it so like literally let's just go back to creb they
[1:23:34.560 --> 1:23:39.280]  don't say oh by the way the guy that stabbed america in the back and help the fraud happen here's creb
[1:23:40.240 --> 1:23:46.720]  remember this is creb the election rapist here he is i think that's absolutely right we've got
[1:23:46.720 --> 1:23:52.560]  to be very careful here just just because someone may believe that uh the president did not win
[1:23:52.560 --> 1:23:57.840]  the election or the president-elect biden did not win or that someone believes in queuing on
[1:23:57.840 --> 1:24:03.600]  doesn't mean that they're going to go pick up arms is that possible alix will there ever be a
[1:24:03.600 --> 1:24:09.040]  solution a real clear full solution to this information crisis that has been perpetuated
[1:24:09.040 --> 1:24:12.720]  in my view by platforms like the one we're used to work facebook as well as twitter and others
[1:24:14.480 --> 1:24:18.960]  it's really hard because what's happening is people are able to seek out the information that
[1:24:18.960 --> 1:24:23.680]  makes them feel good and that is what happening is that you know people have so much choice now
[1:24:23.680 --> 1:24:28.640]  they can choose what their new sources are they can choose what influencers they want to follow
[1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:34.800]  and and they can try to seal out anything that quite helps them question that and that i think
[1:24:34.800 --> 1:24:41.840]  that gets to a really core issue with how our freedoms as americans and the way we've treated
[1:24:41.840 --> 1:24:48.960]  press freedom in the past is being abused by these actors in that we have given a lot of leeway
[1:24:48.960 --> 1:24:53.760]  both in the traditional media and on social media to people to have a very broad range of political
[1:24:53.760 --> 1:25:00.400]  views and it is now again we've given a lot of leeway in america to people's views and now this
[1:25:00.400 --> 1:25:06.160]  big mega corporation that takes money from gulf state dictatorships in communist china they're
[1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:12.320]  going to heal us there is trump lashes out at former dh's official reassert selection was secure
[1:25:12.880 --> 1:25:18.080]  and and and again now he doesn't just want to steal your vote now he wants to steal your voice
[1:25:18.080 --> 1:25:25.920]  like who is the who is the bad the the the villain in the little mermaid what was her name
[1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:35.280]  maleficent ursula ursula so his new nickname is ursula ursula doesn't just want to steal your
[1:25:35.280 --> 1:25:47.200]  vote ursula wants to steal your voice what's he's got you he's got you doesn't he so let's go back
[1:25:47.200 --> 1:25:53.600]  to ursula let's hear from ursula a great economic interest of those individuals to become more and
[1:25:53.600 --> 1:25:58.000]  more radical and i think that one of the places you can see this is on that the fact that you now
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:04.880]  have competitors to fox news on their right oan and newsmax which are carried by all the major
[1:26:04.880 --> 1:26:10.160]  cable networks um who are trying to now outflank fox on the right because the worst part of still
[1:26:10.160 --> 1:26:15.440]  there goes like any kind of even little shows have more viewers than me immediately a bunch of people
[1:26:15.440 --> 1:26:22.240]  chose a pause like i get on the race car tractors other race cars my car won't start i want to stop
[1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:28.320]  the fast cars that that big red one that keeps that blue one that silver one i i don't like them i
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:33.200]  i want them to be disqualified sorry let's go back to dumpy dumpy system and they can do that
[1:26:33.200 --> 1:26:38.400]  both on cable they can do it online um and that becomes a huge challenge of figuring out how do
[1:26:38.400 --> 1:26:43.200]  you bring those people back into the mainstream of fact-based reporting and try to get us all back
[1:26:43.200 --> 1:26:50.320]  into the the same consensual reality and ken is that possible back under your rape farm it's hard
[1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:54.720]  where you're my pimp i think we gotta do a couple things one there needs to be an intentional work
[1:26:54.720 --> 1:26:59.280]  by the social media companies yes a white farm to work on violent extremism in the same way they
[1:26:59.280 --> 1:27:04.720]  worked on violent extremism canosha facebook in 2015 the number one challenge from a content
[1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:10.160]  perspective was the abuse of social media by the islamic state um and there was a a collaboration
[1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:14.400]  totally around by the deep state in between the tech companies and law enforcement to make it the
[1:27:14.400 --> 1:27:19.280]  globalist launched islamic state did it all then use that to crack down free speech mostly young
[1:27:19.280 --> 1:27:23.360]  muslim men at the time around the world now we're talking about domestic audience in the united
[1:27:23.360 --> 1:27:30.880]  states and the challenge is going to be per se in so he's like we're moving from we're moving from
[1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:38.000]  islamics we're moving from islamic state to men in america it goes we spent it works it goes from
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:49.200]  islam to white males islam to white males islam to white males and then then it'll be every male
[1:27:49.200 --> 1:27:53.440]  after that because that's the real target here isn't it let's let's let our little friend finish up
[1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:58.800]  lies young mostly young muslim men at the time around the world now we're talking about domestic
[1:27:58.800 --> 1:28:04.720]  audience in the united states and the challenge is going to be partially that your isis did not
[1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:10.960]  have a domestic constituency in the united states congress but there is over half of the republicans
[1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:15.120]  in congress voted to overturn the election um and there will be yes i have those republicans
[1:28:15.120 --> 1:28:20.080]  or isis you heard on the companies to not take it seriously so i think first what you voted for
[1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:24.560]  that's bad those companies have to be brave in that way we were unable to steal the election for
[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:29.840]  those few people so we've got to be brave and attack members of congress there are people on
[1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:35.040]  youtube for example that have a larger day time a larger audience than daytime cnn and they are
[1:28:35.040 --> 1:28:40.560]  extremely radical and pushing extremely uh radical it's gonna get a lot bigger now dumbass
[1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:46.800]  in particular good dumb cricket and basket burn it out get that piece of filth off my screen god

[1:28:52.960 --> 1:29:03.040]  pimp of literal nazi john claude junger ladies and gentlemen i've studied history i've interviewed
[1:29:03.040 --> 1:29:09.280]  all the experts i have looked at every facet of this and now the only days until the inauguration

[1:33:14.320 --> 1:33:21.200]  there comes a point when powerful organizations and groups decide to make their move no matter
[1:33:21.200 --> 1:33:28.800]  what happens they're committed to the fight it has the name it's called war we are now under
[1:33:28.800 --> 1:33:35.600]  open globalist attack the united states did not see the sneak attack i tried to warn people for
[1:33:35.600 --> 1:33:40.960]  decades people going back to berry goldwater clion scouts and so many others warned before i was
[1:33:40.960 --> 1:33:49.760]  even born but americans were arrogant they believed that we were so strong we could not fall we had
[1:33:49.760 --> 1:33:58.080]  major rot from within and now we face the prospect of slavery and massive persecution
[1:33:58.800 --> 1:34:05.840]  and the full thrust of the globalist attack at levels never before seen that's why tomorrow
[1:34:05.840 --> 1:34:12.000]  i'm going to do a special transmission that i'm the title is this alex jones's last broadcast
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:20.160]  because every day now is precious and i can say more now in a day and do more in a day than i could
[1:34:20.160 --> 1:34:28.720]  in 27 years before because now the dial is over and you can record what i say today or what i say
[1:34:28.720 --> 1:34:35.680]  tomorrow you can listen to it in 50 years or 100 years or in a thousand years it'll be more important
[1:34:35.680 --> 1:34:43.280]  then than when i say it now because it will unfold but it's going to be up to you how it unfolds
[1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:51.840]  so let me give you some good news i don't normally air a special report twice and we aired this right
[1:34:51.840 --> 1:34:56.080]  at the start of the show first five minutes of every show some stations carry news some stations
[1:34:56.080 --> 1:35:00.960]  don't about half our audience tunes in the enemy thought they'd take us off the internet we'd be
[1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:06.160]  done we had hundreds of radio affiliates who we love and who listeners should support and sponsor
[1:35:06.160 --> 1:35:11.200]  and and and and really get behind and and and that's why we're still on air but i'm going to air
[1:35:11.200 --> 1:35:19.840]  this and then get the actual newscast this comes from because it's so important and this deals with
[1:35:19.840 --> 1:35:31.440]  the great reset and if you don't understand the great reset you don't understand what's happening
[1:35:31.440 --> 1:35:37.840]  i could sit here and talk about drag queen story time all over the western world funded by
[1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:42.960]  major corporations to have convicted pedophiles come to your school and have your five-year-old
[1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:47.840]  so in their lap it's an act of dominance i could read the giant stack of news i've got
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:56.640]  about mass death and mass convulsions from the covid vaccines i could read you all these articles
[1:35:56.640 --> 1:36:04.480]  i've got about government files on qanon being a disinformation bolshevik operation
[1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:13.360]  but if you don't understand the great reset and who claus schwaab is and who john claude yunker is
[1:36:13.360 --> 1:36:20.080]  it's like fighting world war two and not knowing what hitler is but i still believe in you and i
[1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:26.640]  don't say that from a position of weakness we've really kicked their ass i figured we'd have to
[1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:31.760]  have a revolution in 50 years from members of the establishment that saw how bad what they did was to
[1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:37.760]  reverse this and now they're not going to get the promise of immortality and the rest of it i was
[1:36:37.760 --> 1:36:44.400]  thinking victory in like the year 2070 we could have victory in 2030 if we want it but we have to
[1:36:44.400 --> 1:36:50.480]  want it we have to understand the the ideology the eugenics and the globalist and we have to then
[1:36:50.480 --> 1:36:57.760]  decide to recognize the enemy and then as men and women say we say no to you and actually engage
[1:36:57.760 --> 1:37:06.960]  the globalist in a real debate not having the denial so here's the report and i'll come back to
[1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:14.640]  and i'll come back and cover more of this in uh detail but it's posted at band on video it needs
[1:37:14.640 --> 1:37:23.040]  to be seen it's a very important report the great reset button has been pushed the great reset is
[1:37:23.040 --> 1:37:29.840]  here here it is this year's davos is very very different to all the previous ones the world
[1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:36.160]  economic forum along with the united nations along with the international monetary fund and along
[1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:42.880]  with any number of prominent globalist organizations and powerful individuals including prince charles
[1:37:42.880 --> 1:37:51.200]  together have jointly promised that the 2021 world economic forum will be used to introduce via
[1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:58.080]  a vast network of connected big tech corporations online activist movements and compliant local
[1:37:58.080 --> 1:38:04.960]  and national governments something they call the great reset it is a global commitment they have
[1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:13.760]  made to use the panic and fear generated by the coronavirus as a means to reshape all our economies
[1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:20.720]  and laws and move to a new form of capitalism that focuses on net zero emissions and this is real
[1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:27.680]  evil we're facing and so folks need to understand that it's coming in to shut everything down there's
[1:38:27.680 --> 1:38:32.400]  a global revolution against the new world order globalism is a consortium of corporations that
[1:38:32.400 --> 1:38:38.560]  do not want free market they want fascist monopoly to carry out eugenics the world today has 6.8
[1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:46.000]  billion people that's headed up to about 9 billion now if we do a really great job on new vaccines
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:51.920]  healthcare reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent australian
[1:38:51.920 --> 1:38:57.840]  vaccine regulator says it's investigating reports of deaths among elderly patients in norway who
[1:38:57.840 --> 1:39:03.040]  have received the Pfizer jab i call them globalists because they call themselves globalists starting
[1:39:03.040 --> 1:39:08.560]  in the 70s the big brzezinski globalist believes in global government not international man and
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:13.120]  libertarianism and you can travel and live wherever you want and their standardized systems i'm all for
[1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:18.080]  that as long as it's free market as long as people agree to it it's not authoritarian but the great
[1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:22.640]  reset and saying you're not essential in shutting down small businesses and coming with forced
[1:39:22.640 --> 1:39:28.640]  inoculations and all of this is authoritarian globalism technocracy in their own words one of
[1:39:28.640 --> 1:39:34.640]  the features of this forced industrial revolution is that it doesn't change what we are doing but
[1:39:34.640 --> 1:39:39.520]  it changes us this is criminal what's happening and this is all the great reset this is all the
[1:39:39.520 --> 1:39:43.600]  u and world government takeover this is 21st century war and these are the guys that say we
[1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:49.760]  can't have national borders and that we got to take migrants quote into our homes out numbers and
[1:39:49.760 --> 1:39:56.800]  facing thousands of people determined to enter Guatemala it doesn't take long for these Hondurans
[1:39:56.800 --> 1:40:03.760]  to push through the lines of soldiers at Guatemala's eastern or more border and press on their aim
[1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:09.760]  to reach the united states many were held up after not presenting ideas or asked for proof of a
[1:40:09.760 --> 1:40:16.720]  negative coronavirus test before entering but many ignored the formal crossing instead illegally
[1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:21.680]  breaching the border nearby we've all got to have covid passports to travel even inside the country
[1:40:21.680 --> 1:40:26.000]  and not even start your car that's where all this is going it's all being announced it's insane
[1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:33.040]  wow we have jack dorsey caught secretly by project Veritas communicating what he believed the top
[1:40:33.040 --> 1:40:39.280]  executives at twitter we you know we we are focused on one account right now but this is going to be
[1:40:39.280 --> 1:40:44.560]  much bigger than just one account and it's going to go on for much longer than just this day this
[1:40:44.560 --> 1:40:50.960]  week the next few weeks to hang on beyond inauguration we have to expect that we have to be ready for
[1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:58.960]  that so the focus is certainly on this account and how it ties to real world violence but also
[1:40:59.600 --> 1:41:05.040]  we need to think much longer term around how these dynamics play out over time
[1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:11.280]  i don't believe this is going away anytime soon we've got the mexican president coming on
[1:41:11.280 --> 1:41:15.280]  saying he's gonna lead a global movement trump should have done this to stop big tech from
[1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:20.160]  abusing the people and censoring everyone in that this is a criminal combine there's one of the
[1:41:20.160 --> 1:41:25.040]  greatest dangers the world's ever seen that's what Ted Cruz says too i'm just thinking god every day
[1:41:25.040 --> 1:41:30.800]  that i'm not them and not involved in the incredible evil they're involved in because these are
[1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:38.880]  enslaved demonically controlled people all right that report is at band dot video it's
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:43.920]  titled the great reset button has been pushed it's got 31 000 views was posted a few hours ago
[1:41:44.800 --> 1:41:52.160]  there's also the video of the police ushering everybody in to the capital and the whole setup
[1:41:52.160 --> 1:41:57.600]  that that that that footage is going super viral right now the q shaman being invited in by the
[1:41:57.600 --> 1:42:03.840]  police and all the rest of it just an incredible time to be alive i've got some covid 19 news i
[1:42:03.840 --> 1:42:10.800]  want to hit when we come back but the good news is people are now recognizing the official corporate
[1:42:10.800 --> 1:42:16.000]  plan to not save the earth the corporation's pushing the great reset have doubled their
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:21.920]  profits last year they don't even pay taxes this is just super cold-blooded war on the middle class
[1:42:21.920 --> 1:42:26.080]  war on poor people and then they collapse the third world and bring giant masses in
[1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:32.320]  that will collapse the nation state itself it's just it's pure criminality so if you want to survive
[1:42:32.320 --> 1:42:37.440]  say no to claus Schwab and bill gates the new world order if you want to be bankrupted and
[1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:42.720]  homeless and destroyed a couple years then by all means choose your destiny that's what god is all

[1:44:10.800 --> 1:44:15.520]  it i've been using it quite a while and i just went looked at the ingredients again the other day
[1:44:15.520 --> 1:44:21.920]  and i see that it contains quercetin which according to some published studies that dr
[1:44:21.920 --> 1:44:29.280]  mercola has cited is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the
[1:44:29.280 --> 1:44:35.120]  dink into the cells so people might want to take a look at that all i know is with dna force
[1:44:35.920 --> 1:44:41.120]  we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:45.040]  prescription but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product
[1:44:45.040 --> 1:44:49.920]  and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top brands
[1:44:49.920 --> 1:44:53.200]  together and that's what produced this so thanks thanks for the plug
