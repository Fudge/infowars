[00:50.600 --> 00:59.360]  Michael Braverman the producer of Jesse Ventura's number one television show on true TV conspiracy
[00:59.360 --> 01:06.560]  theory will be joining us to talk about this week's episode Big Brother with Catherine
[01:06.560 --> 01:14.560]  Albrecht and others I of course am a consultant on the television show and a frequent guest
[01:14.560 --> 01:21.200]  as well we're going to talk about the incredible global warming special last week and the special
[01:21.200 --> 01:26.880]  that I am particularly consulted on and appear in more than any other episode coming up next
[01:26.880 --> 01:33.720]  week secret societies and we can't get Ventura on obviously because he doesn't have a telephone
[01:33.720 --> 01:39.600]  in the rural area of Mexico where he lives during the winter he's now at least gotten
[01:39.600 --> 01:47.680]  on his way down to Mexico in his RV so Michael Braverman with his maiden voyage with us coming
[01:47.680 --> 01:55.800]  up and we've got James Dillingpole coming on the radio show a London Telegraph writer
[01:55.800 --> 02:01.920]  who has really been exposing the global warming fraud we'll look at Copenhagen now in its
[02:01.920 --> 02:09.920]  aftermath we'll also have wide open phones coming up later in the broadcast today but
[02:09.920 --> 02:27.560]  we are live Monday the 21st day of December 2009 now Paul Watson wrote a story so did
[02:27.560 --> 02:34.960]  Aaron Dykes via my analysis on Friday headline Alex Jones Copenhagen births world government
[02:34.960 --> 02:42.600]  framework despite fallout over science fraud and a lot of people said but the media says
[02:42.600 --> 02:48.680]  it completely failed and it did largely fail but the dictators that run the EU and the
[02:48.680 --> 02:56.840]  UN and our country and England Gordon Brown namely being the kingpin said we don't care
[02:56.840 --> 03:01.720]  we're implementing this regardless and now Gordon Brown has given speeches saying just
[03:01.720 --> 03:08.960]  that and we have the news headlines here London Telegraph they'll be nowhere to run from the
[03:08.960 --> 03:19.240]  new world government that is just some of the news that I have on this front here's

[03:48.720 --> 03:57.960]  one Copenhagen climate summit plan for EU to police countries emissions globally here's

[08:05.560 --> 08:34.280]  on the GCN radio network in the last month we spent a lot of time on health care
[08:34.280 --> 08:40.000]  but once the house passed it and the Senate said they had the 60 votes there it really
[08:40.000 --> 08:46.560]  isn't much we can do other than have the states block it and have lawsuits filed in the state
[08:46.560 --> 08:55.240]  and federal courts because this system is unconstitutional it is government crony
[08:55.240 --> 09:02.560]  crony capitalism and we're going to be breaking that down quite a bit later in the broadcast
[09:02.560 --> 09:09.720]  today I still want to mainly focus on Copenhagen in the first hour a little bit into the second
[09:09.720 --> 09:21.560]  hour because as big as the power grab of health care is it is nothing compared to global governance
[09:21.560 --> 09:28.040]  being openly established now here's the good news we're making the tyrants act like tyrants
[09:28.040 --> 09:34.920]  in the two week meeting they were unable to get the majority of nations to sign on third
[09:34.920 --> 09:41.840]  world second world and developing nations the problem is the private IMF and World Bank
[09:41.840 --> 09:48.960]  front companies for the private central banks fully and illegitimately and illegally have
[09:48.960 --> 09:54.840]  seized control in the last 100 years of Europe the United States Australia New Zealand and
[09:54.840 --> 10:03.560]  Japan in the last 50 and they have announced and Gordon Brown is on showing the deal that
[10:03.560 --> 10:09.240]  they don't care if the agreement wasn't signed on to they are going to implement the taxes
[10:09.240 --> 10:16.600]  in the United States in Canada in England in Western Europe in Japan in Australia and
[10:16.600 --> 10:24.160]  New Zealand they don't care it will be implemented that's why we call it the Anglo American establishment
[10:24.160 --> 10:30.360]  because one of their top strategist professor Carol Quigley the head of the Georgetown political
[10:30.360 --> 10:37.360]  science department Bill Clinton's main mentor wrote two books one the Anglo American establishment
[10:37.360 --> 10:42.400]  that was widely publicized and the other written specifically for the State Department but
[10:42.400 --> 10:48.400]  it got out to the public 900 pages titled tragedy and hope and he explained that it isn't the
[10:48.400 --> 10:55.680]  British Empire that rules the planet it is the skeletal structure left over by the British
[10:55.680 --> 11:02.280]  Empire and their governing system their shadow government imperial system that they use in
[11:02.280 --> 11:10.520]  India and in many other nations that that structure that system is what is being used
[11:10.520 --> 11:18.800]  to carry out the global governance so it is that system that is being used that system
[11:18.800 --> 11:28.240]  that Cecil Rhodes when he died gave over $4 billion and that was in the numbers of close
[11:28.240 --> 11:34.800]  to 100 years ago so the equivalent of trillions he gave all of his money to the establishment
[11:34.800 --> 11:39.240]  of global governance and he wrote books how they were going to establish global governance
[11:39.240 --> 11:47.120]  through the British Empire model and so the British Empire and the Royals of England are
[11:47.120 --> 11:53.800]  some of the biggest owners of the system and it's a global consortium of corporations
[11:53.800 --> 12:03.240]  that now own the planet through fraud through chicanery through larceny through their criminal
[12:03.240 --> 12:08.720]  activity through private corporate intelligence agencies governmental intelligence agencies
[12:08.720 --> 12:16.160]  that take their orders from private networks the private networks through global privatization
[12:16.160 --> 12:21.480]  are not really privatizing government the private corporations are becoming government
[12:21.480 --> 12:28.640]  with their mercenaries with their corporate spies and so we have had global government
[12:28.640 --> 12:35.640]  at least since the 1950s but it wasn't complete it wasn't total and so the globalist have
[12:35.640 --> 12:42.120]  been lobbying the states and other units of federal systems worldwide to standardize
[12:42.120 --> 12:48.400]  zoning to standardize police to standardize and raise the taxing system through the model
[12:48.400 --> 12:54.680]  of the OECD the organization of economic and cooperative development that was set up to
[12:54.680 --> 13:00.520]  reorganize Europe after the Marshall plan via the Marshall plan and it's an emergency
[13:00.520 --> 13:06.400]  receivership system that comes into nations they destroy they bankrupt by design and then
[13:06.400 --> 13:13.560]  the globalists take over and so what's happened is the global government is already in place
[13:13.560 --> 13:19.440]  they just tried to through the hype of man-made global warming and now climate change because
[13:19.440 --> 13:23.800]  the earth is cooling so they've shifted terms again first global freezing then global warming
[13:23.800 --> 13:29.760]  global freezing in the 70s global warming in the 80s and 90s early 2000s now in the
[13:29.760 --> 13:37.200]  late 2000s they are shifting into climate change itself that way they can never get
[13:37.200 --> 13:43.600]  pinned down again if it gets hotter or colder so all of that is now happening so that's
[13:43.600 --> 13:50.600]  in place but it's fraudulent they need to get the legislatures and the governments of
[13:50.600 --> 13:56.560]  the world who are already predominantly dominated by these banking interest to openly on paper
[13:56.560 --> 14:02.880]  through treaties signed over what's left of their sovereignty that failed so they are
[14:02.880 --> 14:08.880]  simply announcing publicly the structure that was already there the agreement that was signed
[14:08.880 --> 14:15.440]  on to was signed on to by the US Europe England and just a few other countries on Friday evening
[14:15.440 --> 14:22.680]  into Saturday morning that agreement is now public I did a video announcement on Friday
[14:22.680 --> 14:28.200]  about it we wrote stories Friday Saturday and Sunday on it on Sunday scores of mainstream
[14:28.200 --> 14:33.560]  newspapers the Wall Street Journal the London Telegraph and others reported exactly what
[14:33.560 --> 14:45.120]  we told you on Friday that Gordon Brown is writing the agreement because a blank check
[14:45.120 --> 14:50.920]  was signed on to by Europe and the United States and England Canada and a few other
[14:50.920 --> 14:59.320]  nations that they would give unlimited taxing power to a private banking board established
[14:59.320 --> 15:07.200]  through the World Bank and IMF and now Gordon Brown is openly on television announcing that
[15:07.200 --> 15:13.760]  he is the leader of it he set up the G20 as well back when he was the underling of Tony
[15:13.760 --> 15:19.360]  Blair he is one of the most powerful people in the world Gordon Brown and he is openly
[15:19.360 --> 15:27.920]  announcing that the West will levy taxes against its people as if the banker bailout
[15:27.920 --> 15:34.000]  takeover wasn't bad enough and the planned implosion of the economy for vertical consolidation
[15:34.000 --> 15:40.560]  and integration as if that wasn't bad enough that they will now levy unilaterally taxes
[15:40.560 --> 15:47.680]  to be paid to the IMF and World Bank and that the EU will now go into all the third world
[15:47.680 --> 15:53.600]  nations and will chronicle their industrial development and that if they don't unilaterally
[15:53.600 --> 15:59.480]  themselves as well cut their carbon emissions which is a death sentence for tens of millions
[15:59.480 --> 16:05.040]  a year conservatively I had said hundreds of millions were at starvation level the UN
[16:05.040 --> 16:09.680]  actually says 900 million are on starvation level every year over 15 million starved to
[16:09.680 --> 16:13.760]  death a year this will conservatively increase it by more than 10 million a year we're talking
[16:13.760 --> 16:23.240]  about mega death mega death deaths in the millions and they are announcing that if those
[16:23.240 --> 16:28.000]  nations don't make cuts the IMF and World Bank that have already bought them off paid
[16:28.000 --> 16:33.920]  them off they give Nigeria again a good example billion dollar loan in the 70s Nigeria is
[16:33.920 --> 16:39.120]  paid back with interest over 60 billion in just one loan another three billion dollar
[16:39.120 --> 16:45.080]  loan they've paid back over 40 billion still they're in more debt they can never get out
[16:45.080 --> 16:49.240]  of debt so they take our tax money give it to the IMF and World Bank but in the past
[16:49.240 --> 16:57.600]  Congress every year would be arm twisted into this under the name of aid to other countries
[16:57.600 --> 17:03.680]  but it's not aid it's it's funding for the private IMF and World Bank in foreign aid
[17:03.680 --> 17:07.680]  to come in and take over those countries and that's in State Department memorandum 200
[17:07.680 --> 17:13.720]  of course from 1973 with Dr. Henry Kissinger stating it is to reduce population and if
[17:13.720 --> 17:17.800]  the countries don't reduce population and don't cut food supplies their governments
[17:17.800 --> 17:23.560]  won't be given the billions of dollars so it's a payoff so what's been announced is
[17:23.560 --> 17:29.960]  that world government is here whether you like it or not and here is the London Telegraph
[17:29.960 --> 17:37.360]  on that they'll be nowhere to run from the new world order and it goes on to say the
[17:37.360 --> 17:42.400]  committee to save the world Barack Obama Nicholas Arcozzi Angela Merkel Gordon Brown
[17:42.400 --> 17:48.160]  other leaders at the Copenhagen talks shined an agreement for their nations unilaterally
[17:48.160 --> 17:52.280]  to fund the creation of the global governance system again they're just coming out of the
[17:52.280 --> 17:57.200]  closet it was built behind the giant steel curtains now they've rolled this juggernaut
[17:57.200 --> 18:03.760]  this warmock this colossus of tyranny and death and genocide out into the open dressing
[18:03.760 --> 18:09.880]  it up as the savior of the world here's another key article London Telegraph Copenhagen climate
[18:09.880 --> 18:16.360]  summit plans for EU to police countries emissions Gordon Brown is drawing up plans for the European
[18:16.360 --> 18:22.000]  Union to become a global warming policeman monitoring individual countries compliance
[18:22.000 --> 18:30.600]  with cutting carbon emissions compliance with carbon cutting targets so these nations didn't
[18:30.600 --> 18:36.880]  sign on but through the IMF and World Bank their control but the West in England Gordon
[18:36.880 --> 18:42.640]  Brown is saying that even if the parliament doesn't pass all these new taxes he will
[18:42.640 --> 18:49.400]  implement it in the United States the last week and a half Obama has said quote even
[18:49.400 --> 18:54.800]  if Congress and the Senate won't ratify this I will unilaterally order quote a command
[18:54.800 --> 19:00.480]  and control system to cut and quote it won't be pretty so it's like a mobster saying give
[19:00.480 --> 19:06.640]  me what I want or it won't be pretty Bob I'm going to smash your face in so just open
[19:06.640 --> 19:12.200]  tyranny in your face and there are other headlines on the Wall Street Journal President
[19:12.200 --> 19:18.400]  Obama and the New World Order here's another one on the Washington Post Copenhagen climate
[19:18.400 --> 19:25.600]  deal shows New World Order may be led by the US and China here's another one in the New
[19:25.600 --> 19:31.880]  World Order sterling should suffer yes England and their their their dollar their their pound
[19:31.880 --> 19:38.200]  will suffer when we come back I'm going to play a clip of Gordon Brown pushing all of
[19:38.200 --> 19:45.520]  this and explaining that oh well we're going to implement this regardless this is your

[24:06.160 --> 24:10.840]  and new services we believe that in the United Kingdom we can create something in the order
[24:10.840 --> 24:16.720]  of 400,000 jobs over the next few years from our low carbon industries and services alone
[24:16.720 --> 24:22.520]  but I also want to emphasize that France and Britain and I believe all the other European
[24:22.520 --> 24:28.360]  countries recognize that to make possible a climate change deal which secures the future
[24:28.360 --> 24:34.160]  of our environment we have to work together to provide sufficient finance so that our
[24:34.160 --> 24:39.680]  developing country partners can make the changes that are necessary in their climate change
[24:39.680 --> 24:44.680]  policies to benefit the whole world so there's never been any doubt that we would have to
[24:44.680 --> 24:50.680]  put up some money from the richest countries we have already agreed that there is money
[24:50.680 --> 24:55.720]  in the order of 10 billion dollars to be found over the next three years we are able to finance
[24:55.720 --> 25:01.000]  that from the money that we are announcing today and I believe the rest of the European
[25:01.000 --> 25:06.120]  Union will come on board this is the joint enterprise of France Britain and many other
[25:06.120 --> 25:10.560]  European countries to make possible what I believe is absolutely essential for the world
[25:10.560 --> 25:22.320]  and that's a climate change agreement so that's how the spin works they say there's
[25:22.320 --> 25:28.200]  no doubt this is happening there's no doubt we need these taxes oh the agreement went
[25:28.200 --> 25:32.560]  really well but it actually all blew up in their face but they don't care they're dictatorial
[25:32.560 --> 25:37.400]  they're going to take more money from the west shut down more of our industries he lied
[25:37.400 --> 25:42.120]  and said it'll give you more jobs and then quote give it to the third world now that
[25:42.120 --> 25:48.080]  means give it to the IMF and World Bank and that's actually in scores of newspapers breaking
[25:48.080 --> 25:57.880]  down the actual plan breaking down the program of control and so they're going to take your
[25:57.880 --> 26:02.460]  tax money in the nations they control the west and start giving it to the IMF and World
[26:02.460 --> 26:08.200]  Bank and the IMF and World Bank with its private board funded by your tax money will start
[26:08.200 --> 26:14.680]  monitoring the system worldwide and developing the global governance structure further now
[26:14.680 --> 26:20.520]  here is a short one minute clip from the European Union Parliament with a British member breaking
[26:20.520 --> 26:29.800]  down the basic fraud in Brussels Mr. Godfrey bloom one minute well Mr. President I take
[26:29.800 --> 26:35.080]  the opportunity of wishing the East European cities well in the coming of the very early
[26:35.080 --> 26:40.960]  skiing season and snow and ice that's come there what of course is indicative of the fact
[26:40.960 --> 26:45.800]  that as independent science has now confirmed that the globe is actually cooling and has
[26:45.800 --> 26:53.320]  been cooling since 2002 broadly flat since 1998 so we're all talking about something
[26:53.320 --> 26:58.080]  here which isn't happening I've heard time and time again members here talk of CO2 as
[26:58.080 --> 27:03.440]  a pollutant a pollutant is a life-giving natural gas it gives me the impression that some of
[27:03.440 --> 27:09.560]  them has haven't had the benefit of a formal education isn't this really just about the
[27:09.560 --> 27:15.480]  state being able to get its hand in ordinary people's trouser pocket to steal get more tax
[27:15.480 --> 27:23.360]  from them isn't this all about political control isn't all this about politics and big business
[27:23.360 --> 27:30.400]  the whole thing's a sham this bogus hypothesis this ridiculous nonsense that man made CO2
[27:30.400 --> 27:40.120]  is causing global warming enough please before we damage irrevocably the global economy absolutely
[27:40.120 --> 27:45.520]  but there's this idea that the UN and the IMF and World Bank are stupid and really believe
[27:45.520 --> 27:50.720]  that the earth is dying because of CO2 that the sea levels are rising when they're not
[27:50.720 --> 27:58.280]  rising they know it's a fraud they need something to scare people into relinquishing their rights
[27:58.280 --> 28:06.280]  and freedoms now coming up later I'm going to play several clips from CNN where they
[28:06.280 --> 28:12.160]  have the former Microsoft head the head of Microsoft Development and Science this guy's
[28:12.160 --> 28:18.600]  got a security clearance above ultra calling for geoengineering or terraforming the planet
[28:18.600 --> 28:25.960]  with giant blimps that sprout sulfur dioxide now remember the White House science are John
[28:25.960 --> 28:32.040]  P. Holdren is already announced in his first speech 11 months ago as the new science are
[28:32.040 --> 28:38.240]  the first thing he said was we've been testing spraying from aircraft nuclei to quote cool
[28:38.240 --> 28:45.280]  the planet now we're looking at going fully operational and they're suddenly admitting
[28:45.280 --> 28:49.760]  that they're already geoengineering the planet so they're just throwing it out there like
[28:49.760 --> 28:54.480]  it's no big deal hiding it in plain view just like they're announcing global government
[28:54.480 --> 29:00.200]  out there like it's no big deal in plain view in plain sight meanwhile I have national
[29:00.200 --> 29:04.960]  reporters here every week to interview me for magazines and newspapers I show them these
[29:04.960 --> 29:10.080]  clips I give them documents and they won't even look at them and I say see they're setting
[29:10.080 --> 29:13.800]  up a private global government and they say but don't they mean something different of
[29:13.800 --> 29:18.400]  global government than what you mean and I show them specific white papers where they
[29:18.400 --> 29:23.200]  state it's a global government to bring in a police state that's a quote a planetary
[29:23.200 --> 29:31.920]  regime to dominate and control all human activities but they don't care because the public for
[29:31.920 --> 29:36.840]  20 plus years was taught there's no such thing and so people don't like to admit they've
[29:36.840 --> 29:42.040]  been conned so even as global governments being openly set up people can't resist it
[29:42.040 --> 29:48.120]  because they're so weak minded it's incredible I'm called a crazy person because I read government
[29:48.120 --> 30:00.320]  documents we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[30:00.320 --> 30:04.680]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[30:04.680 --> 30:09.320]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number
[30:09.320 --> 30:13.960]  two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[30:13.960 --> 30:19.600]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[30:19.600 --> 30:24.800]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[30:24.800 --> 30:30.020]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[30:30.020 --> 30:34.200]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[30:34.200 --> 30:38.840]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful
[30:38.840 --> 30:43.000]  backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators

[33:19.600 --> 33:27.000]  admitting chemtrailing and they want to launch through Microsoft patents giant blimps that
[33:27.000 --> 33:33.080]  spray sulfur dioxide in the upper atmosphere to artificially cool the earth this is terra
[33:33.080 --> 33:38.240]  forming or geoengineering again 14 years ago but talk about chemtrails and be laughed
[33:38.240 --> 33:44.840]  at it's now declassified that there's a giant weather modification program going on bare
[33:44.840 --> 33:51.920]  minimum and the evidence is clear the global government is manipulating the weather and
[33:51.920 --> 33:58.280]  I believe preparing to cause major weather disasters as a pretext for everyone to submit
[33:58.280 --> 34:05.400]  to global government problem reaction solution just as Hitler fire bombed his own Reichstag
[34:05.400 --> 34:11.040]  to set up a police state in Germany or just as the czars would bomb their political enemies
[34:11.040 --> 34:16.760]  and then blame them for it this is a massive setup developing will be covering that coming
[34:16.760 --> 34:23.240]  up in the next hour ladies and gentlemen for the balance of the hour in Jesse Ventura
[34:23.240 --> 34:30.560]  stead because the governor's now escaped to Mexico for a few months we have Michael
[34:30.560 --> 34:36.560]  Braverman the executive producer of conspiracy theory and again when I say this is a trail
[34:36.560 --> 34:43.740]  blazing groundbreaking series that's gotten the highest ratings in the history of true
[34:43.740 --> 34:53.160]  TV which has had some incredibly highly rated television shows it is it is not hype this
[34:53.160 --> 35:00.720]  show blew away my expectations when I saw the episodes I've seen sections of them heard
[35:00.720 --> 35:05.200]  about the shows consulted some on the first seven episodes appear in quite a few of the
[35:05.200 --> 35:12.400]  episodes I trusted Jesse Ventura because I talked to him over a year ago when he visited
[35:12.400 --> 35:18.000]  with me for three days in Austin and he said look I have final cut on this and I'm not
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.600]  going to do it unless they do what I want because I don't know if all this stuff's real
[35:21.600 --> 35:25.680]  but I'm setting out with an open mind and we would have big arguments and stuff about
[35:25.680 --> 35:30.600]  you know just how bad the new order was and the shows really set out with an open mind
[35:30.600 --> 35:36.520]  and discover that yes global warming's a hoax and discover yes there is big brother and discover
[35:36.520 --> 35:40.880]  yes the government's hiding what really happened with 9-11 we're not completely sure what happened
[35:40.880 --> 35:45.600]  but we know the official story's got holes in it that are giant I mean this is groundbreaking
[35:45.600 --> 35:52.000]  nothing like this truly from an objective perspective has ever aired on national television
[35:52.000 --> 35:58.040]  and I cannot tell you how honored I am to be involved with this this is groundbreaking
[35:58.040 --> 36:02.720]  and their global warming special made major news in a lot of papers because they got Ben
[36:02.720 --> 36:08.200]  Santor of the UN to admit he cut out sections of his own report where their own scientist
[36:08.200 --> 36:15.000]  at the UN told them that man was not causing global warming joining us is Michael Braverman
[36:15.000 --> 36:21.960]  Michael incredible job and thank you for including me in this program thank you so much and we
[36:21.960 --> 36:28.480]  are we're filled to have you well I mean tell people about the brain child of this and and
[36:28.480 --> 36:32.360]  the hell you went through to get it on TV and your doubts you can even get it on and
[36:32.360 --> 36:38.040]  now the amazing success and then what's coming up in the next few episodes well I actually
[36:38.040 --> 36:42.720]  had a gentleman's bet with Jesse Ventura with the governor that show would never see
[36:42.720 --> 36:47.720]  the light of day even after they pick show up said okay you know y'all could do seven
[36:47.720 --> 36:53.280]  episodes he still did not believe I guess part of me didn't believe either they would
[36:53.280 --> 37:01.680]  actually ever air these shows they are so explosive and we do have we call it revelations
[37:01.680 --> 37:07.720]  for show we do have two facts for show that we work really hard on finding out and some
[37:07.720 --> 37:12.800]  of your listeners may know it but I guarantee you the general public doesn't and uh react
[37:12.800 --> 37:20.080]  has been pretty amazing well I mean I can't watch a lot of television and especially these
[37:20.080 --> 37:28.240]  uh you know reality shows but the shows are really riveting I mean they're they're riveting
[37:28.240 --> 37:35.600]  and it's a real who done it Perry Mason investigation it's amazing well thank you and you know we
[37:35.600 --> 37:41.120]  try to make them obviously really entertaining we don't want to do it right documentary so
[37:41.120 --> 37:44.880]  we try to keep it entertaining and we try to keep it moving fast and thank you for the
[37:44.880 --> 37:50.400]  compliment about being a who done it that's what we were really trying to get at get
[37:50.400 --> 37:55.600]  some information out there that people don't know you gotta do it in an entertaining way
[37:55.600 --> 38:02.000]  otherwise you know no one's gonna watch you have to really really entertaining general
[38:02.000 --> 38:12.640]  public may not be up to some of these well you've certainly done that Michael and let's
[38:12.640 --> 38:18.640]  spend some time on some of the previous episodes and then give people a little bird's eye view
[38:18.640 --> 38:24.400]  I inside scoop on what's coming up Wednesday night and the next Wednesday night of course
[38:24.400 --> 38:31.280]  big brother airs Wednesday night 10 p.m. Eastern 9 p.m. central and then of course next Wednesday
[38:31.280 --> 38:36.640]  it's gonna be the secret society episode that gets into population reduction control everything
[38:36.640 --> 38:42.480]  I'm a huge part of that program and very very excited about it but specifically the global
[38:42.480 --> 38:48.400]  warming special I mean you went right to the heart of it to Maury strong sent cameras to China
[38:48.400 --> 38:53.600]  you went and interviewed the UN scientist you went and interviewed myself you you got
[38:54.800 --> 39:00.320]  George Hunt who's refused to do interviews in the last decade we got him to talk and he worked
[39:00.320 --> 39:05.920]  with strong for over five years I mean this this was an amazing television show well thank you and
[39:06.960 --> 39:12.240]  you know the thing about getting those people is we work really hard as I said before about
[39:12.240 --> 39:18.960]  coming up with stuff that even people that are up to speed on this may not know or may not have
[39:18.960 --> 39:24.480]  had a chance to know I mean this guy Ben Stanter you know a lot of people had said oh Ben Stanter
[39:24.480 --> 39:30.640]  put the data and for him to admit on camera as you said well yeah I did of course he has an explanation
[39:30.640 --> 39:38.000]  for it you know and when we were doing the show the network was really scared all you know how
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.760]  many would pack global warming you know everyone knows global warming is a bad thing and even
[39:42.400 --> 39:48.400]  Governor Ventura was like oh I believe in global warming at the end of the show all of us involved
[39:48.400 --> 39:54.320]  in it behind the scenes all looked at each other and went wow we really came up with some information
[39:54.320 --> 40:01.440]  then got to climate which validated everything we said absolutely validated everything we said
[40:01.440 --> 40:05.600]  so you know we all sat around the production office sort of we're patting ourselves on the
[40:05.600 --> 40:11.040]  back on wow we were ahead of that curve and you know we really were and that that was a really
[40:11.600 --> 40:18.080]  good feeling let's talk about that and the last three months because I mean these shows are very
[40:18.080 --> 40:22.640]  fresh they were being shot right up to the last minute I was in Los Angeles just a month and a
[40:22.640 --> 40:30.880]  half ago organizing with you guys the George Hunt interview and then you guys had the show in the can
[40:31.840 --> 40:37.280]  three four weeks ago right as climate gate breaks you guys already had a bunch of climate gate
[40:37.280 --> 40:44.400]  where the UN and others were caught red-handed faking data then the coup de gras the the the
[40:44.400 --> 40:52.880]  icing on the cake the absolute proof comes out only verifying what you guys had separately
[40:52.880 --> 40:56.880]  discovered that shows what a good investigation you were doing you interviewed Lord Moncton
[40:57.680 --> 41:02.880]  and so many others right before Moncton already burst on the scene here in the U.S. and became a
[41:02.880 --> 41:07.440]  phenomenon with tens of millions of views on YouTube of his speeches and the interviews we've
[41:07.440 --> 41:13.680]  done here live on the radio I mean perfect timing as the entire global warming man made global
[41:13.680 --> 41:20.240]  warming fraud burst into flames the television show airs I mean talk about Providence that's
[41:20.240 --> 41:26.960]  almost revolutionary war-level Providence well we yeah I mean I'd like to think it's that important
[41:26.960 --> 41:33.120]  I mean and we did get lucky you know the thing that convinced me was I Richard Lyndon you know
[41:33.120 --> 41:38.640]  I know you saw me you know I is a classic MIT professor you know I doubt he knows how to
[41:38.640 --> 41:44.160]  you know turn his car on or change a light bulb in his whole life that in climate and this guy
[41:44.160 --> 41:50.160]  is an MIT professor he's got no access I need to work for the oil company and he's paid by anybody
[41:50.160 --> 41:55.120]  but MIT and I talked to him on the phone if you didn't want to do the interview he said well you
[41:55.120 --> 42:00.240]  know it's very complicated climate change is very you know there's so many issues I said well if
[42:00.240 --> 42:05.760]  people were watching the data why are they doing it he said there was a pause on the phone he said
[42:05.760 --> 42:15.200]  money and power this is you're my guy and also you guys this is really reality TV you shot in
[42:15.200 --> 42:21.600]  your war room with Jesse and yourself and other members of the production you're all arguing about
[42:22.160 --> 42:26.080]  whether it's real or not and Jesse says well I think they're making money off this but it
[42:26.080 --> 42:32.080]  still might be real and you were the guy who says no guys I've seen the documentation it looks like
[42:32.080 --> 42:36.400]  this is a scam I mean I got a hand it to you you know that was shot what three four or five
[42:36.400 --> 42:39.760]  months ago I'm not sure of the date but I know it was shot at the beginning of the production of
[42:39.760 --> 42:44.640]  the global warming episode you turn out to be the guy who was right from the beginning in the TV show
[42:45.360 --> 42:50.800]  well I read the research really carefully and I'll say something funny this coming week's episode
[42:50.800 --> 42:56.080]  this Wednesday night exactly the opposite how you'll see me in the war room and I really get into
[42:56.080 --> 43:02.400]  it with Jesse about his brother issue do a do a little segue here with him and he and I really
[43:02.400 --> 43:07.760]  got into it and it wasn't fake we got hot at each other because I was kind of saying well wait a
[43:07.760 --> 43:13.520]  minute you know I'm not saying the Patriot acts are good thing but you know if you know a couple
[43:13.520 --> 43:18.000]  of terrorists are sitting on no cell phones in there you know they were rallies having a burger
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.320]  and they're talking about blowing up the ball that I'm about to go into you know with my family I
[43:22.320 --> 43:28.160]  damn well want to know about it he got really hot at me um because that's what I felt at the beginning
[43:28.160 --> 43:33.840]  of the episode what you don't see is because we didn't have time in the end of the episode when I
[43:33.840 --> 43:40.240]  look at him I go I don't know if I can curse on your show but no don't don't and I'm not joking
[43:40.240 --> 43:48.240]  I go holy you were right and I was wrong so the drama of the episode is real again you'll see me
[43:48.240 --> 43:54.160]  in the war room just really getting hot at him but he got hot at me so it's really interesting
[43:54.160 --> 44:00.000]  what happened how we changed during the show yeah for folks that don't know Jesse's for real
[44:00.000 --> 44:04.240]  getting to hang out with him over the last three four years I guess four years ago when I first
[44:04.240 --> 44:12.560]  met him and being off camera he's really a smart guy he's multifaceted but he really does get angry
[44:12.560 --> 44:19.520]  in in arguments or not even so much angry he gets very focused and and very very adamant and serious
[44:20.080 --> 44:23.520]  driving around the hill country where they might have had huge arguments so when people see these
[44:23.520 --> 44:33.600]  arguments this really happens I mean Ventura really does turn into a big bear yeah and he's
[44:33.600 --> 44:38.320]  passionate he's absolutely a believer we are not going to do a show unless he believes in it
[44:38.320 --> 44:45.440]  you know and here's a guy who sits and reads reads all day long you know at this time really
[44:45.440 --> 44:49.680]  doing the research really doing the reading we don't do a topic unless he believes in it
[44:49.680 --> 44:53.680]  you know global warming was a bit of a push because they say at the beginning he didn't believe in
[44:53.680 --> 45:00.240]  it but at the end of the episode and now with climate change he would totally convert and it's
[45:00.240 --> 45:05.040]  not just a who done it everyone watching is literally brought along with the process and
[45:05.040 --> 45:10.640]  and I have to say it this is something new in reality TV usually it's some rich teenager
[45:10.640 --> 45:15.200]  with her boyfriends getting drunk and and fighting with her parents on the telephone
[45:15.200 --> 45:22.240]  and car wrecks this is a bunch of researchers and governor Jesse Ventura literally trying to
[45:22.240 --> 45:29.840]  get to the bottom of something you are transported there to the debates to the interviews to the
[45:29.840 --> 45:35.840]  different places in the world that you guys travel yeah and and that as I say that backstage stuff
[45:35.840 --> 45:41.040]  for that warren stuff that stuff is real we you know and you'll see there are other guy
[45:41.040 --> 45:47.120]  alex piper is his name and he's a skeptic he and the governor really get into it and you
[45:47.120 --> 45:52.560]  should put half of the camera these guys will just go toe to toe and they'll battle it out
[45:52.560 --> 45:58.160]  you'll absolutely battle it out it's amazing I I know you don't want to give people too much
[45:58.160 --> 46:04.720]  of a spoiler on this but for our listeners michael braverman executive producer of the
[46:04.720 --> 46:10.320]  number one new television show on true tv conspiracy theory that airs 10 p.m. eastern
[46:10.320 --> 46:16.960]  9 p.m. central every wednesday night give us a little bit of a window into this week's episode
[46:16.960 --> 46:22.880]  that airs in 48 hours well I want to say one thing that your listeners alex if there's one
[46:22.880 --> 46:31.440]  show in this series that you're going to watch make it this week's show and I and I obviously I
[46:31.440 --> 46:36.240]  have a little stake in it this week's show blew me away when I started doing the research
[46:36.240 --> 46:42.000]  with staff when I started doing the research I can tell you without hyping it there are two facts
[46:42.800 --> 46:47.680]  this show which is the big brother conspiracy this one tonight there are two facts it will
[46:47.680 --> 46:55.600]  absolutely blow you away um the stuff that we uncovered that I didn't know about and I'm a
[46:55.600 --> 47:01.520]  pretty good researcher and we put it on on the screen and um you know again I don't think it's
[47:01.520 --> 47:06.400]  hyping or or being immodest to say that there's a couple of revelations I'll call them that will
[47:06.400 --> 47:11.600]  absolutely shock you get you over the head and you're gonna be sitting at home going I I didn't
[47:11.600 --> 47:18.400]  know that and you know it's a call to action because if we don't do something uh you know in
[47:18.400 --> 47:23.840]  five ten three six years whatever it is we are going to be living on the prison planet
[47:25.360 --> 47:30.960]  absolutely now talking to Ventura a year ago when the pilot was shot which is the 9-11 episode
[47:30.960 --> 47:35.920]  the rest of it was shot this year and talking to you behind the scenes and others whatever you
[47:35.920 --> 47:40.000]  want to say about the mainstream media they have never allowed anything like this to air before
[47:40.000 --> 47:46.720]  uh and it was really hard to get this on the air I remember just two days before the harp
[47:46.720 --> 47:53.040]  special aired Jesse privately said to me still I don't think it's gonna air I mean when you guys
[47:53.040 --> 47:58.400]  say that that's not hype genuinely Ventura didn't think it was gonna air I don't know how this big
[47:58.400 --> 48:04.400]  brother is gonna air I don't know how the 9-11 aired why because I know there's a lot of control
[48:04.400 --> 48:08.960]  over the media you know every person in a production company or at a network isn't a globalist agent
[48:08.960 --> 48:12.720]  and uh but they you know don't like to go with things that are too controversial against the
[48:12.720 --> 48:17.680]  government how is this getting on the air I mean how did you guys do this I mean you've done
[48:17.680 --> 48:24.800]  something no one's ever done well I give all the credit to the governor governor was so passionate
[48:24.800 --> 48:30.480]  as they said before he went to the network I went with him um and he sat there and looked at the
[48:30.480 --> 48:35.600]  boss of the network in the eye I give everybody credit here including the boss of the network
[48:35.600 --> 48:42.080]  he looked him in the eye and said let me do this show you let me cover the the topics the information
[48:42.080 --> 48:47.120]  I want to cover I will guarantee you people will watch and that's exactly how it turned out and
[48:47.120 --> 48:51.920]  you know I'm the first guy because I work in the TV business I'm the first guy that I'm not
[48:52.560 --> 48:59.040]  no final executive because I've met my share of them but I will give true TV an amazing
[48:59.040 --> 49:03.920]  amount of credit they actually followed through and they had the courage of their convictions
[49:03.920 --> 49:08.640]  and they put the show on and as I say you know the governor lost his gentleman's bet with me
[49:08.640 --> 49:13.280]  and everybody else that those would ever see the light of day but here we are so it's kind of a
[49:13.280 --> 49:22.560]  miracle well uh Wednesday night 10 p.m eastern 9 p.m central folks we need this show to continue
[49:22.560 --> 49:27.440]  to be an even bigger success because this will force mainstream media to understand
[49:28.080 --> 49:33.440]  that the american people are waking up and want the truth and that if the mainstream media doesn't
[49:33.440 --> 49:37.920]  start covering these issues they're going to lose all their viewers and I think at the heart of it
[49:38.640 --> 49:43.520]  I remember three years ago I was talking to a hollywood film director I don't know if she's
[49:43.520 --> 49:47.200]  still there I don't know the details he was talking about a new head of court tv and that
[49:47.200 --> 49:52.960]  was going to shift to a new format and he said they were looking then at these issues and then I
[49:52.960 --> 49:59.360]  talked to a bbc producer who also makes shows for the us and I know that true tv even three years
[49:59.360 --> 50:05.040]  ago was looking at this so I think ventura with his gravitas and his history and yourself
[50:05.040 --> 50:10.880]  uh michael braverman the right place the right time the right people the right brains uh cable
[50:10.880 --> 50:17.280]  television has to start doing something avant-garde to get viewers and I think that's the real reason
[50:17.280 --> 50:23.120]  that this is airing and also uh you know you guys did this on a shoestring for tv productions and so
[50:23.120 --> 50:29.200]  you guys also gambled a lot you bet a lot of your time and uh energy on this and so uh again
[50:29.200 --> 50:34.160]  I salute you michael I will thank you and our production partners do too and again I give all
[50:34.160 --> 50:38.240]  the credit to the governor because he is the spearhead he was the point of the spear on this
[50:38.240 --> 50:44.320]  whole show and you guys put amazing amounts of energy into this final segment with michael
[50:44.320 --> 50:48.800]  braverman the executive producer of conspiracy theory you can see it this wednesday night when

[55:20.880 --> 55:25.840]  mindblower you know this is something that i think the governor also was a little bit
[55:25.840 --> 55:31.120]  skeptical about when we started um you know i mean you can sit around and talk and i know you do
[55:31.120 --> 55:35.920]  alex uh you do a fantastic job you know you can say that there are these groups the builder bird
[55:36.560 --> 55:39.360]  no society and they're out there and they're right in the world everyone's going to roll
[55:39.360 --> 55:45.360]  their eyes and go yes sure but when you started you know when we started to dig into it we found
[55:45.360 --> 55:49.760]  some stuff as i say you know anybody who watches these shows whether you like the shows now you
[55:49.760 --> 55:53.600]  know turn that tv off but you're going to walk away are you going to sit near couch and you're
[55:53.600 --> 55:58.640]  going to go wow i didn't know that but you're going to see some facts about the builder bird
[55:58.640 --> 56:04.400]  that i guarantee you even people who are regular listeners to your show and really into this stuff
[56:04.400 --> 56:09.520]  didn't know so that's our promise to the viewers is that there's going to be new facts new things that
[56:09.520 --> 56:14.560]  that hopefully will be mind blowing every week and there are things about the the builder birds
[56:14.560 --> 56:18.320]  and other secret society that i gotta be honest with they scared me
[56:18.320 --> 56:29.040]  well i did consulting for a scanner darkly produced in 2005 with the keanu reeves my
[56:29.040 --> 56:33.680]  own writer woody herlson a bunch of others of course i'm in the film and i did consulting
[56:33.680 --> 56:38.720]  with tommy pilotta one of the producers and and richard linkler the director and i thought i knew
[56:38.720 --> 56:43.120]  everything they discovered a bunch of stuff that i had trouble believing until i saw the
[56:43.120 --> 56:48.560]  document so yeah i mean don't think you ever know at all folks i know you guys did deep research
[56:48.560 --> 56:52.240]  and have discovered some things that when i found out about it and went and looked it up
[56:53.840 --> 57:00.320]  it's it's just it's it's so horrible well it's amazing what what's going on that as you say
[57:00.320 --> 57:04.240]  alec never gets reported in the mainstream media but i think that's changing and hopefully it's
[57:04.240 --> 57:09.520]  changing something what you mentioned hollywood i think all the people that aren't allowed to
[57:09.520 --> 57:16.400]  it i want to break that up michael your phone's breaking up a little bit can you get closer to
[57:16.400 --> 57:20.480]  it yeah how about now i like sounds good go ahead i was just gonna say really quickly
[57:20.480 --> 57:26.720]  you mentioned hollywood i could call quickly on a weekly basis on hollywood and i wanted to

[58:01.440 --> 58:06.720]  be some reveal shockers hopefully in the second season about people stepping out of the shadows
[58:06.720 --> 58:11.680]  famous people you see on tv and you see in the movie stepping out of the shadows and

[1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:51.440]  some of them in secret you know uh kind of out of the way restaurant and you know again it sounds
[1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:55.360]  like i'm hyping and i'm really not these are names that would blow your mind they blew my mind
[1:01:55.360 --> 1:02:01.840]  and i've said to all of them i've said look at some point you have to be bigger than yourself
[1:02:01.840 --> 1:02:06.720]  you got to step out you got to do what you need to do for your country and what you believe in
[1:02:06.720 --> 1:02:12.880]  and uh you know i can't you know sort of beat that drum and again hopefully if everyone supports us
[1:02:12.880 --> 1:02:17.200]  and you know we get a good uh rating this week for the big brother conspiracy show hopefully
[1:02:17.200 --> 1:02:22.240]  we'll go on and i do believe that in our second season there will be people coming on this show
[1:02:22.240 --> 1:02:29.920]  on this show that will shock everybody unbelievable i'm just so honored to be involved with you uh
[1:02:29.920 --> 1:02:34.800]  michael braverman and notice you just broke that about all these big stars contacting you last
[1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:41.120]  segment i didn't even know that and you notice i just threw out some names because uh because i
[1:02:41.120 --> 1:02:46.080]  can't believe over the last five six seven years i mean obviously charlie sheen it has come on air
[1:02:46.080 --> 1:02:52.480]  a bunch and this is basically all he thinks about and works on but he tells me separately not just
[1:02:52.480 --> 1:02:58.320]  people i've been contacted by or i've met with but then i talked to other directors other movie stars
[1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:05.440]  basically 80 of all the top stars are completely obsessed with this it's not snowboarding it's
[1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:11.040]  not hookers they're obsessed with uh it's not partying it's not surfing they are obsessed with
[1:03:11.040 --> 1:03:16.880]  this hollywood is on fire and awake to the new world order how do we get them to come out and
[1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:23.120]  then you get a cultural shift away from the fake left that hollywood's been known as michael we
[1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:27.840]  are sitting on top of something really big i mean i mean do you get that feeling yeah i think we
[1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:32.640]  could be and you know but you gotta understand one thing charlie sheen uh when he came when he
[1:03:32.640 --> 1:03:39.360]  came out of the shadows he had taken unbelievable abuse unbelievable abuse and i will go so far
[1:03:39.360 --> 1:03:44.000]  to say he's probably hurt his career even though he's got a nice career obviously he's on a tv show
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:49.760]  but it takes courage because the left you know that the old west really still runs hollywood
[1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:56.240]  they are they are militantly opposed to anybody talking about these issues militantly opposed
[1:03:56.240 --> 1:04:00.160]  so now that's something that we all deal with and he really starts to come out
[1:04:00.160 --> 1:04:05.600]  i applaud him for the taking huge amount of courage you know again i'm aware of this most
[1:04:05.600 --> 1:04:10.160]  people aren't you're more aware of it than i my michael braverman again big tv producer a lot of
[1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:15.920]  hit shows and things under his belt that's what i'm saying i don't think listeners realize the
[1:04:15.920 --> 1:04:20.320]  sea change this signifies and i don't see how they're not going to pick it back up with these
[1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:24.960]  record ratings but as you said there's a lot of powerful people out there that's why it's so
[1:04:24.960 --> 1:04:31.680]  important this show even be a bigger hit because ladies and gentlemen you will see top movie stars
[1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:38.800]  on television uh on this program and you guys are trailblazers and so too the victor goes the spoils
[1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:44.400]  michael you certainly have hit the barbed wire you are like lewis and clark you and jesse ventura
[1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:48.720]  and i am just ecstatic to be involved we're gonna let you go i'm gonna say bye to you during this

[1:05:20.560 --> 1:05:26.080]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[1:05:26.080 --> 1:05:31.280]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[1:05:31.280 --> 1:05:35.840]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:59.040]  michael braverman is pretty high-powered talking about the old left freaking out because it's not
[1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:04.000]  a left-right issue they just want to keep that paradigm in place there is a rebellion in hollywood
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:09.840]  i have known about this for at least a decade big time for six years and charlie sheen broke the
[1:09:09.840 --> 1:09:15.680]  ice on this i just we are so close ladies and gentlemen we are so close to shifting the entire
[1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:22.320]  paradigm that was some breaking news you just heard just like conspiracy theory last week with
[1:09:22.320 --> 1:09:27.920]  ventura got bill santa on video to admit he cut out five scientists in his own internal report
[1:09:27.920 --> 1:09:32.880]  for the ipcc saying man does not contribute to global warming that the earth may not even be
[1:09:32.880 --> 1:09:37.680]  warming this is incredible okay for the rest of the hour then i'm getting into the terraforming
[1:09:37.680 --> 1:09:42.480]  being announced the geoengineering on cnn now the global warming control freaks want to quote
[1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:47.040]  control our weather probably so they can create calamities and get their pretext for global
[1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:57.280]  taxes james dilling poald is a best-selling uh author journalist author tv critic uh daily
[1:09:57.280 --> 1:10:03.440]  telegraph uh he also writes for so many other great publications uh he's a british journalist
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:09.040]  and novelist was educated at christ church oxford he is a member of several uh author several novels

[1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:26.080]  telegraph and as a tv critic for the spectator he has a blog the daily telegraph which he uses to
[1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:31.280]  disprove man-made climate change and this is so exciting to have him on because he's one of the
[1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:37.840]  most prolific and detailed writers in the telegraph uh we got big headlines out about global government
[1:10:37.840 --> 1:10:44.160]  being established we've got gordon brown there will be nowhere to run from the new world order
[1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:49.120]  that's another great writer the telegraph janet uh daily we have another one kopenhagen climate
[1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:56.240]  summit planned for e u to police countries emissions and that's uh james kerr cup if i think i'm
[1:10:56.240 --> 1:11:00.480]  pronouncing it right so just great job over there at the telegraph and it's good to have a james
[1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:06.400]  dilling poald on with us sir wonderful to have you thank you for having me alec i tell you uh is
[1:11:06.400 --> 1:11:12.720]  it safe to say that the man made global warming fraud has crashed and burned like the hennenberg
[1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:19.360]  i think we shouldn't count our chickens obviously christmas came early for for you and me uh first
[1:11:19.360 --> 1:11:27.200]  of all with climate gate and second with the the spectacular failure of the kopenhagen carbon
[1:11:27.200 --> 1:11:34.560]  best loving loving but i i think we've got a long way to go but don't forget we've got what 20 years
[1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:40.720]  since um the the warmest started putting about this story remember that the rio conference
[1:11:40.720 --> 1:11:49.520]  yes was organized by your friend and mine morris strong um now uh we we skeptics have got a long
[1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:55.440]  a lot of catching up to do before we can undo all the damage which has already been done all the
[1:11:55.440 --> 1:12:01.440]  the lies and propaganda which are being put about by the mainstream media um all the mechanisms that
[1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:07.920]  have been put in place by coyote for example for carbon trading you know you've got the the carbon
[1:12:07.920 --> 1:12:15.840]  trading floor set up up in chicago you've got uh you know 10 owned by goldman fax for example
[1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:21.760]  see but a lot of people out there who are who stand to make a lot of money out of this this whole
[1:12:22.320 --> 1:12:31.600]  agw thing and they aren't gonna gonna surrender that money easily absolutely we have different
[1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:37.840]  numbers some say over a hundred billion in the us spent on this fraud and in buying off the
[1:12:37.840 --> 1:12:42.560]  scientist literally because you can't get funding unless you believe in the chicken little scenario
[1:12:42.560 --> 1:12:48.000]  any idea how much globally has been spent by governments and corporations pushing this uh
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:55.360]  takeover all in at the moment is that the the the global carbon trading market is currently worth
[1:12:55.360 --> 1:13:02.880]  about 120 billion dollars now this don't forget is trading something that doesn't actually exist
[1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:09.200]  really even it's just thin air isn't it carbon co2 we breathe it out the idea that traders have
[1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:15.840]  created a mechanism whereby they can trade the stuff that we all exhale is is uh enron economics
[1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:22.400]  writ large and funnily enough the guy who invented co2 trading was none other than ken lay the guy who
[1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:32.160]  founded enron and this market this false market is estimated to increase into the trillions
[1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:38.160]  within the next two decades so we're going to be finding that the world's most valuable traded
[1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:45.360]  commodity even more valuable than oil or gold is this co2 thing and the only way this market can
[1:13:45.360 --> 1:13:53.440]  survive is by pan global government regulation so you know i mean if america says no to cap and trade
[1:13:53.440 --> 1:13:59.920]  that means that the bottom will fall out of the carbon trading market and a lot of uh bad people
[1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:05.280]  including al gore and i think molly strong will end up losing a lot of money which is why i think
[1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:11.440]  it's very much in everybody's interest that we urge for example the u.s senate uh when it votes
[1:14:11.440 --> 1:14:19.600]  next year to vote out cap and trade because that will be i suspect the real death knell of of this
[1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:27.280]  great scam absolutely now gordo brown the unelected prime minister of england that no one can seem to
[1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:33.440]  get rid of uh he is saying oh i'm writing the agreement that the industrialized nations have
[1:14:33.440 --> 1:14:38.960]  signed on even if the third world got wise and bolted uh that that the west will give money to
[1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:44.320]  the imf and world bank i guess to dangle in front of the third world to sign on which of course
[1:14:44.320 --> 1:14:49.200]  conservative estimates have it at 10 million a year extra that'll starve to death who are living on
[1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:54.880]  that you know that that razor's edge between starvation and life uh he's saying that they're
[1:14:54.880 --> 1:15:01.440]  just going to go ahead and implement it obama last week said look command and control i don't care
[1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:08.560]  if the senate doesn't ratify or go along i'm going to use the epa to declare uh co2 as
[1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:15.600]  some type of deadly nerve gas and and and i mean so so they're just openly coming out as as dictatorial
[1:15:15.600 --> 1:15:22.800]  creatures and now they say the e you uh and and and break this down for us the e you uh is going to
[1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:28.640]  now uh keep track of everyone even if you don't sign on they're going to be your minder and hold
[1:15:28.640 --> 1:15:34.880]  back your imf world bank uh dole if you don't go along with it well the the european union
[1:15:34.880 --> 1:15:41.360]  certainly the european socialist superstate has been uh a very early adopter of the whole climate
[1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:49.600]  the whole you know carbon trading mechanisms you know uh they are uh forcing all the member states
[1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:57.840]  to reduce their co2 levels by x amount by 2020 and and the various libtard governments have
[1:15:57.840 --> 1:16:04.880]  have mostly embraced this wholeheartedly um it's interesting that the the european union has
[1:16:04.880 --> 1:16:11.520]  formed on this uh almost all the the member states that the european union went on those rare
[1:16:11.520 --> 1:16:17.440]  occasions where their people have had the chance to vote on the issue about whether or not they
[1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:25.600]  want to be part of this um ever-increasing socialist superstate they always say no what does the european
[1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:31.920]  union do it always says okay we're just going to ignore the voters voters uh request democratic
[1:16:31.920 --> 1:16:38.000]  requests but we're going to carry on as usual and ride roughshod over their desires this this
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:45.600]  practice uh is also being adopted by the uh the htw the international global warming movement you
[1:16:45.600 --> 1:16:51.600]  know never mind all the scientific evidence that emerges and is emerging all the time
[1:16:51.600 --> 1:16:56.480]  that that age you know that global warming is not man-made and even if there is global warming
[1:16:56.480 --> 1:17:02.000]  going on it is not catastrophic never mind all scientific evidence we are going to carry on
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:07.440]  with our program as before completely disregarding i mean i don't know how presumably all your
[1:17:07.440 --> 1:17:12.640]  listeners are on on side alex but uh the thing i noticed that blogging on this subject uh on the
[1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:22.080]  internet is just how many people out there on the internet uh are feeling betrayed by their
[1:17:22.080 --> 1:17:28.160]  government by their newspapers which are not telling them the truth about and that was my
[1:17:28.160 --> 1:17:33.760]  next point i read abc news i read literally hundreds of the comments i don't even really
[1:17:33.760 --> 1:17:37.840]  read the story i go to the comments and the mainstream media keeps shoveling the lie that
[1:17:37.840 --> 1:17:42.080]  everyone agrees that the earth is warming everyone agrees that polar bears are all dying which is a
[1:17:42.080 --> 1:17:48.480]  total lie everyone agrees we've got to have a global government and then literally 95 percent
[1:17:48.480 --> 1:17:53.360]  of the comments are saying we're sick of you liars and they're well thought out they're writing
[1:17:53.360 --> 1:17:59.520]  their own little mini articles with links to facts there is a rebellion i i think the mainstream
[1:17:59.520 --> 1:18:04.800]  media is this what you're getting at the mainstream media is is committing sepico
[1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:10.720]  by by continuing the party line i think your analysis is absolutely spot on there is no
[1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:18.400]  question that this this will be seen in the future when people people analyze uh the death of the msm
[1:18:18.400 --> 1:18:24.240]  this will be the point where the msm killed itself because it is refused to move with the
[1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:29.600]  times it's refused to address the issues that are concerned to its readers i mean unless you
[1:18:29.600 --> 1:18:36.160]  buy the idea that every single person or 95 percent as you say of the people who use the internet
[1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:42.880]  are completely mad uh unless you buy the theory what you have to accept is that uh
[1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:50.720]  uh the interests of the people are not being served by for example the bbc by pretty much
[1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:56.560]  every every newspaper like the new york times to the times of london and so on they are being
[1:18:56.560 --> 1:19:01.760]  completely ignored all these newspapers and of course the bbc as well and that and of course
[1:19:01.760 --> 1:19:08.080]  most of the mainstream tv networks in the u.s apart from possibly fox uh all these organizations
[1:19:08.080 --> 1:19:13.840]  employ environment correspondence and all these so-called environment correspondence
[1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:20.000]  they might as well you know be be writing press releases for for for greenpeace or al gore their
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:25.520]  land dogs they never question the scientific issues they're not interested in finding out
[1:19:25.520 --> 1:19:30.880]  the truth all they care about is is towing a particular line which is the world of getting
[1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:38.160]  hotter it's all our fault we must spend more money now unbelievable let's continue then talking about
[1:19:38.960 --> 1:19:44.160]  the seppuku that's when i guess the japanese term for when they commit suicide with a short
[1:19:44.160 --> 1:19:49.600]  sword that is pretty much what the mainstream media has already got the knife in they're now
[1:19:49.600 --> 1:19:55.360]  pulling it up into their rib cage uh completing uh the act of seppuku and all i can say is more

[1:24:33.760 --> 1:24:41.520]  dillingpole d-e-l-i-n-g pole dot com okay you got cut off by the satellite break you were getting
[1:24:41.520 --> 1:24:48.240]  into the mainstream media committing suicide because they just are such arrogant elitist continue
[1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:53.280]  well i'm gonna say how fantastic it's been for people like you and me because uh we are the guys
[1:24:53.280 --> 1:24:58.960]  who are putting out the truth when when the people who are the guardians of the truth are no longer
[1:24:58.960 --> 1:25:04.240]  doing their job you know we used to rely on on newspapers like The Times and and and so on to
[1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:10.320]  be telling us what's going on in the world and instead their response seems to be to accuse us all
[1:25:10.320 --> 1:25:16.400]  of false consciousness you know we you know if only the government spend a bit a bit more
[1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:21.520]  educating us about about global warming then then we'd see the truth seems to be their line
[1:25:21.520 --> 1:25:28.800]  and the same so i've never come across a greater disjunct between what real people think about
[1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:33.360]  something and what what the government and the media and so on are telling them to think it's
[1:25:33.360 --> 1:25:38.320]  extraordinary i think we've got you know a divided world we're like it's like we're living in
[1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:44.000]  parallel universes whereas on the one hand you've got big government big oil big business
[1:25:45.040 --> 1:25:50.240]  the green movement and on the other hand you've got ordinary people we're living in different
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:57.360]  in different universes that's a key point that you just raised is that the control left always says
[1:25:57.360 --> 1:26:01.200]  oh you're working for the oil companies if you don't believe in man-made global warming but then
[1:26:01.200 --> 1:26:07.520]  i go look at the main funders it's big corporations big oil the stock markets who want a new derivative
[1:26:07.520 --> 1:26:14.000]  they don't care if taxes get passed on the average blue collar or middle-class worker with the family
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:19.600]  and bills to pay i mean truly it is the people of the world and now when you go to any comment page
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:26.160]  whether it's youtube or you name it literally 90 or more agree with reality and you've got this 10
[1:26:26.160 --> 1:26:32.320]  percent telling us we're kooks we're weirdos we're crazy one more example hundreds of articles a day
[1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:38.000]  literally yeah announcing global government announcing world government but then we talk about
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:43.920]  it and we get called kooks i mean this is crazy yeah but that's because um the people who are
[1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:51.120]  pushing agw haven't got any um arguments or facts on their side so all they can do is resort to
[1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:56.640]  throwing out these accusations for example that that deniers so-called deniers uh you know that
[1:26:56.640 --> 1:27:03.840]  that's to make us look like holocaust deniers we are we are sponsored by big oil you know any any
[1:27:03.840 --> 1:27:09.040]  scientist who speaks out against man-made global warming they instantly say oh well he's in the
[1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:16.240]  pay of of of the carbon industry well the fact is that the carbon industry and big oil moved out of
[1:27:16.240 --> 1:27:23.920]  of uh defend of denialism a very long time ago they sponsor eco conferences they're they're heavily
[1:27:23.920 --> 1:27:31.840]  exposed to the carbon trading market um they see they see atw as a big opportunity to make money
[1:27:31.840 --> 1:27:36.800]  that's how big companies operate so of course they're not going to back the side that they think
[1:27:36.800 --> 1:27:42.160]  is you know is not being champion wasn't it ken lay in the mid 1990s with al gore that had a bunch
[1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:47.120]  of meetings with oil company execs that explained to them that this was a giant scam they should
[1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:54.480]  jump on board it was exactly what what ken lay said and i think you know people in in the financial
[1:27:54.480 --> 1:28:00.480]  industries they're they don't go in there because they they care about mother nature or or or because
[1:28:00.480 --> 1:28:05.440]  they want to look after polar bears they do it because funnily enough they want to make money
[1:28:05.440 --> 1:28:10.160]  and whatever they see is the best way of making money is the means that they will choose i mean
[1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:17.920]  that's you know that's the nature of um of finance but it doesn't mean to say that um uh they've got
[1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:22.960]  rightness or truth on their side they're just they're just vultures picking over whatever they can
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:30.160]  well they certainly are how do you see the collapse of the mainstream media
[1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:35.360]  unrolling i mean if they are committing suicide what is that process going to look like
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:39.200]  i think it's going to be messy because i think what they're going to do when they realize the
[1:28:39.200 --> 1:28:43.520]  mistake they've made they are going to start fighting back and we're already seeing this
[1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:50.160]  have you noticed for example how um certain media organizations are now trying to ban people from
[1:28:50.160 --> 1:28:56.480]  linking to uh to to articles and on on news sites that's where i was going next and we're going to
[1:28:56.480 --> 1:29:02.400]  come back and talk about that you've got australia saying we're going to employ uh chinese-style
[1:29:02.400 --> 1:29:07.520]  net censorship of political stuff we don't like the government will decide off of a complaint
[1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:13.360]  system uh we've got england talking about maybe we should restrict we've got canada the us now
[1:29:13.360 --> 1:29:18.720]  talking about it i agree they're going to try to shut us up definitely in the same way that they're
[1:29:18.720 --> 1:29:24.480]  trying to shut down the the talk radio stations in america under the fairness doctrine this this
[1:29:24.480 --> 1:29:30.240]  idea that because talk radio tends to favor the right rather than the left because that's because
[1:29:30.240 --> 1:29:34.320]  the right has got all the ideas and the left has got none whatsoever and no one wants to listen to
[1:29:34.320 --> 1:29:40.240]  a libtard floating on floating on the back of the world you know so for that reason they have
[1:29:40.240 --> 1:29:46.160]  decided oh well this is unfair we must get big government to step in james stay there gotta
[1:29:46.160 --> 1:29:53.840]  break again and we'll come right back we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the

[1:36:09.760 --> 1:36:14.160]  guest long segment i want to sit back and let you talk about whatever you think is most important
[1:36:14.160 --> 1:36:18.320]  how they're implementing global governance by stealth through this carbon system how they're
[1:36:18.320 --> 1:36:22.240]  saying we don't care if countries didn't sign on we're going to start regulating and controlling
[1:36:22.240 --> 1:36:28.720]  you but when we got cut off you were talking about censorship and how they're openly announcing
[1:36:28.720 --> 1:36:35.200]  how great it is to keep everyone safe and there's been calls for lord montan in major papers in
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:41.760]  england that he's a climate tyrant and that he should be charged with treason literally i mean
[1:36:41.760 --> 1:36:48.960]  you cannot make this level of brazen tyranny up so sir please continue along those lines
[1:36:48.960 --> 1:36:55.200]  yeah well i think that um the agw scam the anthropogenic global warming scam
[1:36:55.200 --> 1:36:59.520]  is the big one you know i mean there are other problems in the world you know obama care and
[1:36:59.520 --> 1:37:06.080]  things like that and islamic fascism obviously is a big big problem but i would say that the
[1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:13.920]  issue uh whose evil creeping tentacles delve into ever deeper recesses of our lives the really big
[1:37:13.920 --> 1:37:20.640]  one the dangerous beast is undoubtedly man-made global warming and the industry pushing this
[1:37:20.640 --> 1:37:30.480]  this idea because it is an excuse to tax humanity on a scale never before envisaged they are talking
[1:37:30.480 --> 1:37:37.520]  the the international energy agency reckons that to it to to reduce man-made global warming to a
[1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:44.880]  suitable level it is going to cost 45 trillion dollars now the human mind cannot conceive even
[1:37:44.880 --> 1:37:51.360]  what a billion looks like a trillion is what considerably more than that and uh this where
[1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:55.280]  is money going to come from and where's it going to go well the place is going to go
[1:37:55.280 --> 1:38:00.800]  is into the pockets of third world kleptograph dictators it's going to go into the pockets of
[1:38:00.800 --> 1:38:06.720]  people like morris strong al goh into the pockets of all the people who we know has been caught
[1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:17.280]  with sedom and others wandering aid money back to themselves this scam is just unbelievable
[1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:24.320]  it's done in the name of environmental righteousness i think what half of these yoghurt yoghurt weaving
[1:38:24.320 --> 1:38:30.400]  crusty loons supporting the green movement don't realize is that the people they're in bed with
[1:38:30.400 --> 1:38:37.200]  are the the their most vicious ideological opposite you know who would have thought that
[1:38:37.200 --> 1:38:41.680]  that the people like um oh god i mean i don't want you're familiar with these guys georgia
[1:38:41.680 --> 1:38:47.120]  mondia have you ever come across here oh he openly calls for world government carbon credit uh
[1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:54.000]  ration cards yeah that's the one well but this guy you know i mean whatever his sad reasons he
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:59.280]  wants he wants to bomb us all back to the agrarian he's a control freak yeah well he wants to
[1:38:59.280 --> 1:39:03.840]  want to live in yurt and to travel around you know in coracles you know and so we don't have the
[1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:08.240]  wheel anymore and maybe we'll probably even be banned by we'll just have to sit around shivering
[1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:13.440]  in caves well actually you know europe has been banning in some countries and putting taxes
[1:39:13.440 --> 1:39:19.520]  on fireplaces and space eaters oh yeah i mean i must say one of my great pleasures in life is
[1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:26.000]  going to a pub an english pub and sitting outside where there is one of those outdoor heaters
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:30.320]  and yes a cigarette which you know which would just about allowed to have in this country and
[1:39:30.320 --> 1:39:36.640]  that puts out carbon too yeah well exactly i like to do my do my bit strike my tiny blow
[1:39:36.640 --> 1:39:43.760]  in the great war for freedom yeah but but i mean it is an odd scenario where you've got all these
[1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:49.360]  crazies uh going to the cope and hate and to protest in their polar bear costumes and stuff
[1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:55.120]  and the people they're actually marching in support of are the most vicious form of capitalist
[1:39:55.120 --> 1:39:59.600]  you could possibly imagine now i believe in the capitalist system but i believe in the capitalist
[1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:04.480]  system that favors the little man that favors the kind of hardworking entrepreneur small
[1:40:04.480 --> 1:40:10.400]  businessman what i don't like is corporatism you know i mean this is what this is exactly what
[1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:16.080]  happened under nazi germany it's a piratical system of looters yeah exactly well this is what
[1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:22.720]  happened under naziism hitler allowed certain favored business concerns to prosper under his
[1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:28.480]  fascist regime and this is exactly what's happening in the world now certain favored big businesses
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:34.320]  which can afford the to absorb the massive costs which are going to be imposed on us all
[1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:39.680]  by carbon trading and so on these businesses are going to going to thrive but but people like you
[1:40:39.680 --> 1:40:45.280]  like you and me uh and your listeners are going to be screwed something rotten and those big
[1:40:45.280 --> 1:40:51.360]  businesses will pay their cut to the herman gurings and joseph gerbils and adolf hitlers of
[1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:57.520]  today yeah i don't think these analogies are inappropriate either i mean i you know i'm
[1:40:57.520 --> 1:41:03.680]  william crystal who died recently though one of the founders of neoconservatism yes he wasn't so
[1:41:03.680 --> 1:41:09.680]  interested in in in the great clash between between um you know the free west and uh and the
[1:41:09.680 --> 1:41:16.400]  soviet union what interested him far more was the war between liberalism and i suppose what you
[1:41:16.400 --> 1:41:22.560]  call libertarianism because i think he sense that this is a much more subtle and dangerous war that
[1:41:22.560 --> 1:41:27.600]  was going on because a lot of people don't realize it's happening because because you know that there's
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:33.360]  no evil soviet empire trying to you know point its ss 20 that is anymore people imagine that the
[1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:39.920]  great clash of civilisation is over actually what happened now is that we are fighting a gorilla war
[1:41:39.920 --> 1:41:48.800]  of ideas against again it it's uh for the right of the individual to enjoy his liberty uh versus
[1:41:48.800 --> 1:41:53.440]  big government which wants to take our liberty away from us which is allied with select global
[1:41:53.440 --> 1:41:58.480]  corporations that don't want a free market they want a government that can deliver them monopolies
[1:41:58.480 --> 1:42:05.120]  yeah absolutely and i suppose when one starts talking about using words like conspiracy uh
[1:42:05.120 --> 1:42:09.760]  people on the liberal left say aha you're just another conspiracy freak you're making all this
[1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:15.760]  stuff up i would say it's only 50 percent of conspiracy in that um for example people in
[1:42:15.760 --> 1:42:21.440]  the green movement don't share the same goals as as people you know in big business who are
[1:42:21.440 --> 1:42:28.240]  making money out of it what happened is that a rag bag of of different different people
[1:42:28.800 --> 1:42:33.760]  just happened to have found a common theme whose ideals they share but for completely
[1:42:33.760 --> 1:42:38.480]  different reasons so you've got the greens who want us all to live in in you know mud huts and
[1:42:38.480 --> 1:42:45.040]  stuff and and and um bath the root restore the barter system and uh abandoned fun and we'll just
[1:42:45.040 --> 1:42:50.960]  just eat on you know raw raw leaves and uh give up meat and stuff and then on the other hand
[1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:56.320]  you've got the sinister bigot business interest who just wants to line their pockets you know uh
[1:42:57.120 --> 1:43:02.960]  couldn't be more different but they have found a common cause and that cause is atw
[1:43:02.960 --> 1:43:08.640]  well here's the greek prime minister bilderberg at copenhagen we are observing the birth of global
[1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:15.040]  governance and you link through he made these quotes it's in the official copenhagen uh record
[1:43:15.040 --> 1:43:21.120]  we have herman von rumpi i could play the clip again but i played it literally 30 40 times saying
[1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:25.120]  this is the first year of global governance we have ban chi moon in the new york times and
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:29.600]  an editorially wrote saying the green movement is the funding mechanism for global government
[1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:35.120]  uh we have al gore saying it we have gordon brown saying it they're all admittedly setting it up
[1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:40.000]  but then when we say okay we don't want your global government and again here's the london
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:46.560]  telegraph or or daily telegraph uh uh headline saying there'll be nowhere to run from the new
[1:43:46.560 --> 1:43:52.160]  world government uh but but but again they're they're trying to tell us that they're announcing
[1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:57.360]  this but then we're not allowed to oppose it as if we're so stupid they can announce global
[1:43:57.360 --> 1:44:03.040]  government but then tell us it doesn't exist what is the psychological tactic there of say monbiot
[1:44:03.040 --> 1:44:08.000]  i mean it's real fast because you i mean you just you brought him up monbiot writes books
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:13.840]  writes articles every few weeks a new story he signs petitions calling for a dictatorial world
[1:44:13.840 --> 1:44:19.680]  government to carry out environmental austerity but then he writes articles attacking myself and
[1:44:19.680 --> 1:44:24.560]  others saying we're lunatics and none of this exists i mean does he think we're so stupid he
[1:44:24.560 --> 1:44:30.000]  has such disrespect for us i mean what is the psychological tactic there you know in some
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:37.360]  ways alex we are stupid you know you just as in the 1930s hitler wrote this book called mine camp
[1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:45.120]  in which he stated explicitly exactly what his plan was he hated the jews he hated the slavs
[1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:51.440]  he wanted to to destroy the slavic intervention he wanted a a form of new world order with him
[1:44:51.440 --> 1:44:57.280]  adult hitler in charge well how do people respond to this oh he's just a he's just a sub little
[1:44:57.280 --> 1:45:03.840]  german austrian in need of a bit more love you know uh we we don't need to rearm against this guy
[1:45:03.840 --> 1:45:09.200]  it's all going to be okay this is the power of wishful thinking people do not want to deal
[1:45:09.200 --> 1:45:16.160]  with a reality that doesn't suit them and i think it's the same with uh this hgw conspiracy now
[1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:22.000]  now as you say people you know the club of rome various people have been very explicit about
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:28.720]  this and this is of course the classic um the way fascist movements operate i don't
[1:45:28.720 --> 1:45:35.120]  with you red red uh journal goldberg's rather excellent book liberal fascism he describes
[1:45:35.120 --> 1:45:43.520]  how uh in order for fascist regimes to take over they need uh a crisis and if that crisis
[1:45:43.520 --> 1:45:47.840]  doesn't actually exist they need to invent the crisis and this is what you've got rama manual
[1:45:47.840 --> 1:45:53.920]  saying as well haven't you yes make it an opportunity of this crisis and of course the idea that the
[1:45:53.920 --> 1:46:00.640]  world is going to end uh due to catastrophic man-made global warming is the best crisis you could
[1:46:00.640 --> 1:46:07.440]  ever imagine which is why so many people have have um been have been gathering around this
[1:46:07.440 --> 1:46:12.880]  wonderful theme and and working it up for all their worth because this is their excuse they need
[1:46:12.880 --> 1:46:18.960]  you know this crisis is so important that it is it is far too important to be left to the uh to
[1:46:18.960 --> 1:46:24.800]  the people of the of the the world's constituent countries to vote on the issue it's so important
[1:46:24.800 --> 1:46:31.120]  this must be taken away from the people and and it must be it must be decided by experts experts
[1:46:31.120 --> 1:46:36.240]  from the united nations in future they will they will take power even over elected government
[1:46:36.240 --> 1:46:42.160]  they will notice how they always say in all their talking points whether it's david the roth child
[1:46:42.160 --> 1:46:48.160]  or whether it's bancai moon whether it's algore or gordon brown they always say the time for talk
[1:46:48.160 --> 1:46:54.080]  and debate is over this is the way it is that's absolutely right and again that that is a classic
[1:46:54.080 --> 1:47:01.120]  product of nazism and fascism it's all about action action now because action means that you don't
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:09.120]  have to think about anything anymore and of course this is this is why why algore says in his his
[1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:16.560]  propaganda his lennie riefenstein type propaganda movie an inconvenient truth why he says that uh
[1:47:16.560 --> 1:47:24.160]  consensus has been reached the science is settled because once you do that you instantly pull the
[1:47:24.160 --> 1:47:28.880]  rug from those who say hang on the debate isn't over hang on let's talk about this hang on with a
[1:47:28.880 --> 1:47:35.680]  few more facts that are slowly beginning to emerge hang on it isn't settled at all um if you say act
[1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:40.560]  now we must act now we must stop thinking you are overriding these people you are overriding
[1:47:40.560 --> 1:47:46.000]  the arguments and of course as we've agreed the arguments are not in these people's favor the facts
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:51.040]  are not in their favor which is why they try and uh ride russia over those facts as quickly as they can
[1:47:52.640 --> 1:47:57.600]  you're absolutely right but again i see the momentum beginning to shift against them
[1:47:57.600 --> 1:48:03.760]  and and before the last break and we got cut off you brought up internet censorship this is openly
[1:48:03.760 --> 1:48:09.360]  being announced globally they're now even uh senator j rockefeller has said quote we be better
[1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:14.480]  off never inventing the internet they're now openly saying in australia oh we're going to censor
[1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:20.160]  political views we don't like or people that leak things on wiki leaks we're going we're now
[1:48:20.160 --> 1:48:25.840]  going to block this uh they're really moving to do this people better take them serious can you
[1:48:25.840 --> 1:48:34.880]  speak to that and how we how we block this completely openly authoritarian undemocratic uh fraud well
[1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:39.440]  there's two things to say are you familiar with the with the work of the italian marxist thinker
[1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:46.720]  antonio gramshi yes gramshi of course was the guy who said that in order for the left to win the uh
[1:48:46.720 --> 1:48:53.600]  win the political war it must first win the cultural war and and and there must be a long march on
[1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:58.480]  the institutions and so what happened is that little by little over the years the liberal left
[1:48:58.480 --> 1:49:03.120]  captured the uh seats of learning the university which are of course all left wing they had the
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:09.520]  long view of history yeah exactly they took over the over the newspapers they took over the schools
[1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:14.960]  they took over every aspect i mean the music industry uh pretty much every aspect of our
[1:49:14.960 --> 1:49:20.240]  culture is controlled by the liberal left but i would even call them liberal left they're just
[1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:25.360]  criminals that call themselves liberal so they can be the bleeding heart and you're the bad
[1:49:25.360 --> 1:49:31.200]  conservative what you will the point is that that that up until very recently until algore invented
[1:49:31.200 --> 1:49:37.760]  the internet which i'm sure is regretting now until our algore invented the internet we didn't
[1:49:37.760 --> 1:49:43.760]  really have a way of expressing our descent to all this and now this thing comes along the internet
[1:49:43.760 --> 1:49:49.200]  and it's fantastic because it means that people like you and me can can express ourselves and
[1:49:49.200 --> 1:49:54.480]  and and and tell our version of the truth which is actually the real truth that it happens um
[1:49:54.480 --> 1:50:00.800]  and of course how does the liberal left the how do the crazes respond to all this by trying to shut
[1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:06.880]  down this medium of of the free expression they're going to try and do it i don't think and this is
[1:50:06.880 --> 1:50:12.240]  the one bit of hope i can offer to your listeners today i don't think they can get away with it if
[1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:17.600]  china can't do it if china can't close down the internet then i think nobody can
[1:50:17.600 --> 1:50:22.640]  do it but i agree with we've got to resist the terms to do so we've got well they partially
[1:50:22.640 --> 1:50:28.160]  blockaded it and and and it's a process but then they just make the alternative information that
[1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:34.160]  much more uh in demand but regardless they're openly announcing their intention to which shows
[1:50:34.160 --> 1:50:38.880]  everyone who these people really are yeah well of course already you've got some of the places
[1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:42.480]  on the internet which have been captured by the liberal left i mean are you familiar with the
[1:50:42.480 --> 1:50:48.560]  case about wikipedia oh it's a complete fraud half of what they've got about me we'll stay there
[1:50:48.560 --> 1:50:52.000]  tell us about when we get back final segment with our guests certainly we'll have to have him back
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:51:00.480]  very impressive uh information but yeah wikipedia it's a fraud studies have shown that many people

[1:54:01.920 --> 1:54:09.200]  the controlled leftoids using bush's unpopularity and all the bad things he did boomeranged into
[1:54:09.200 --> 1:54:15.040]  power and are intensifying everything bush did and adding a lot of new tyrannies in and whenever
[1:54:15.040 --> 1:54:19.280]  you listen to the controlled left they all they talk about is how smart they are and what geniuses
[1:54:19.280 --> 1:54:24.400]  they are and how stupid everybody else is and it's all just a bunch of prattle i mean they're a
[1:54:24.400 --> 1:54:30.160]  religious cult and a great example of this is wikipedia they've got my name spelled wrong
[1:54:30.160 --> 1:54:36.000]  almost all the info is wrong and they won't let us change it uh they use the worst photo of me
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:40.480]  they can they're caught constantly in this info you were getting into that james dillingpole
[1:54:41.120 --> 1:54:45.760]  yes i'm disappointed one of my favorite wikipedia entries ever ever was the one that said i was
[1:54:45.760 --> 1:54:52.480]  voted the sexiest man alive by this girl school in in uh in wiltshire in england and um somebody
[1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:59.120]  went and cancelled it out but but on a more sinister point uh this guy william connelly have
[1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:04.480]  you heard of this guy yes willie william connelly was the guy was was a sort of an officially
[1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:14.080]  appointed wikipedia moderator and this guy doctored will rewrote five thousand four hundred and twenty
[1:55:14.080 --> 1:55:21.520]  eight articles about global warming so any article that didn't suit his his version of events either
[1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:28.320]  warmest version events uh he simply uh either destroyed or altered to his point of view this
[1:55:28.320 --> 1:55:33.760]  guy actually eliminated the medieval war period for example on wikipedia which is the site of
[1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:38.800]  course everyone goes to these days for their information so even you know even the internet
[1:55:38.800 --> 1:55:43.280]  isn't isn't safe and it's the same with google i mean you're presumably familiar with how
[1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:51.280]  google uh has has been squashing uh references to climate gate yes you know well when i first
[1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:56.720]  wrote about that story i think i think within the first first fortnight climate gate had got
[1:55:56.720 --> 1:56:02.960]  something like 30 million google hit if you look now it's it's gone down to something like 16 million
[1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:09.440]  how can it have fewer fewer hits than it had had two weeks ago it's it's it's crazy well we know
[1:56:09.440 --> 1:56:14.560]  schmidt the ceo of google openly says he wants a world government world taxes is that right
[1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:20.480]  it's not the same it's not the same as gavin schmidt is he for the the the climate guy no no
[1:56:20.480 --> 1:56:28.480]  the the the head of no the head of google is a huge supporter of al gore oh no i didn't we should
[1:56:28.480 --> 1:56:33.920]  or we should all kill ourselves now before we get any word well then there's the hypocrisy of these
[1:56:33.920 --> 1:56:40.640]  guys all the big climate change heads like bloomberg and gore and uh soros and of course
[1:56:40.640 --> 1:56:45.760]  head turner they have some of the biggest carbon footprints in the world yeah yeah absolutely i
[1:56:45.760 --> 1:56:52.640]  mean look at look at i i mean the guy in charge of the ipcc dr regender pichare i don't know how
[1:56:52.640 --> 1:56:56.240]  long he's gonna last with all all all stuff that's been coming up about him have you been reading
[1:56:56.240 --> 1:57:01.120]  about that just just extraordinary yeah tell folks about how he gets steel mill shut down in england
[1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:08.720]  to move him to india oh i mean it's extraordinary the regender pichare the guy who's in charge of
[1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:15.040]  the ipcc the supposedly neutral neutral panel which is which is in charge of giving us the
[1:57:15.040 --> 1:57:21.200]  accurate figures on how much climate is changing and how much we need to spend to to uh stop this
[1:57:21.200 --> 1:57:28.320]  disaster happening this guy is in it up to the armpits in in uh in businesses which stand to
[1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:34.400]  make money out of carbon trading so this guy is saying oh we need stiffer regulation on car on
[1:57:34.400 --> 1:57:41.440]  carbon and on the other hand he's making millions out of carbon trading uh one of the things he
[1:57:41.440 --> 1:57:50.080]  managed to do was was to uh well he's allied with this indian conglomerate called tata and tata
[1:57:50.080 --> 1:57:58.240]  owns this steel company in britain and he recently closed down this steel company why uh because
[1:57:58.880 --> 1:58:07.200]  by shifting around uh its carbon credit it could make over i think a billion pounds just just for
[1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:13.680]  having closed down this business and then set up a one in india instead producing the same amount
[1:58:13.680 --> 1:58:19.760]  of carbon but just under the special terms of global carbon trading rules india is somehow
[1:58:19.760 --> 1:58:26.400]  exempt so it's all okay i mean it is just the massive scam james dilling poll i know you've
[1:58:26.400 --> 1:58:30.080]  got a lot of stuff to do we've got a one minute break i'm gonna ask you during the break if you
[1:58:30.080 --> 1:58:35.840]  can come back for five minutes and finish up on a few other issues dealing with this global takeover
[1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:45.760]  through the fake environmental movement you are listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
[1:58:45.760 --> 1:58:52.720]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:58:52.720 --> 1:58:57.920]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[1:58:57.920 --> 1:59:02.800]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[1:59:02.800 --> 1:59:08.400]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:59:08.400 --> 1:59:13.440]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[1:59:13.440 --> 1:59:18.560]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[1:59:18.560 --> 1:59:22.720]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[1:59:22.720 --> 1:59:27.440]  weather-related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[1:59:27.440 --> 1:59:31.840]  insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[2:00:27.680 --> 2:00:34.320]  and video clips coming up singing in as the former head science advisor to microsoft saying
[2:00:34.320 --> 2:00:38.320]  they need to terraform the planet to save us from global warming turns out bill gates has
[2:00:38.320 --> 2:00:44.720]  got the big patents on that and we'll open the phones up as well james dillingpole is a best-selling
[2:00:44.720 --> 2:00:50.480]  author he writes for the daily telegraph and the tv critic for the spectator james dillingpole.com
[2:00:50.480 --> 2:00:55.200]  is his website and he's one of the leading people out there exposing the fraud of man-made
[2:00:55.200 --> 2:01:01.520]  global warming absolutely spot on as they say over in england and i say cheers to him with
[2:01:01.520 --> 2:01:07.600]  christmas coming up in the last four minutes we've got left in this segment chronicling climate
[2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:12.800]  gate that was only one blip that got a bunch of attention we've had been santer with the fraud
[2:01:12.800 --> 2:01:19.040]  at the un we've had we've had algore lying about carbon dioxide going up simultaneously with
[2:01:19.040 --> 2:01:24.560]  temperature chronicles some of the fraud of these people yeah well this is one of the great
[2:01:24.560 --> 2:01:30.160]  defenses offered by by the warmest is that this is a you know the climate gate was a
[2:01:30.160 --> 2:01:35.840]  was an un unimportant affair involving a few insignificant scientists that just one you know
[2:01:35.840 --> 2:01:42.080]  obscure establishment in in the boggy fenland of eastern england and it doesn't matter the fact is
[2:01:42.080 --> 2:01:48.480]  that climate gate what it did was confirm what a a select band of brave scientists and bloggers
[2:01:48.480 --> 2:01:55.760]  and people have been saying all along which is that the the whole system is rotten to the core
[2:01:55.760 --> 2:02:03.760]  now these these scientists exposed in the climate gate emails just also happened to be the small
[2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:11.520]  cabal of scientists who write the ipcc's papers on global warming these guys are the lead authors
[2:02:11.520 --> 2:02:17.920]  you know one of the big names that keeps cropping up in those emails is michael man and michael man
[2:02:17.920 --> 2:02:25.760]  is the american scientist who invented the infamous hockey stick curve that was the one the great big
[2:02:25.760 --> 2:02:32.800]  curve that algore in an inconvenient truth he shows this this graph of how global temperatures
[2:02:32.800 --> 2:02:40.240]  are rising and he has to mount on this kind of crane lifting device to because the curve is so
[2:02:40.240 --> 2:02:45.280]  steep upwards that only with this crane can he rise to point it out and everyone in the audience
[2:02:45.280 --> 2:02:51.200]  laughs the fact is that this graph which was invented by michael man to show how dramatically
[2:02:51.200 --> 2:02:57.760]  the world is heating up has been been proved wrong not once but twice by these two heroic
[2:02:58.560 --> 2:03:04.240]  scientists called mackintow and mckittrick and mackintow and mckittrick have been on the case
[2:03:04.240 --> 2:03:09.440]  of the walnuts for a very long time and they've been using their one of them in the columnist the
[2:03:09.440 --> 2:03:14.560]  other isn't a statistician and what they've been doing is using their skills to analyze all the
[2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:20.400]  data um that has been used by these these walnuts scientists and they've proved
[2:03:20.400 --> 2:03:25.360]  beyond doubt that these guys aren't cooking the books they are fiddling with and they called it
[2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:32.080]  a fraud and then the emails came out confirming exactly what they were saying with the fraudsters
[2:03:32.080 --> 2:03:37.120]  talking about them and how they had to suppress this information that's exactly right and what
[2:03:37.120 --> 2:03:42.320]  was brought and it is fraud but it's what these these um these scientists have been doing is
[2:03:42.320 --> 2:03:48.720]  skimming off millions and millions of dollars worth of funding and denying that funding to any
[2:03:48.720 --> 2:03:55.280]  scientists who disagree with this mean that about atw this is this is part of the problem
[2:03:56.160 --> 2:03:59.520]  those emails not only show them cooking the books but they also show them
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:06.320]  bullying um the opposition into silence trying to ensure that that that are any journals that want
[2:04:06.320 --> 2:04:11.680]  to give work to to dissenting scientists that they don't do so and if they try to do so they
[2:04:11.680 --> 2:04:17.040]  want to get them shut down now this is this is completely wrong this is not how science advances
[2:04:17.040 --> 2:04:21.840]  well unfortunately james dilling poll we are out of time thank you for spending so much time with

[2:08:23.040 --> 2:08:27.280]  coming up they're saying the next three to four days then it goes to conference between the house
[2:08:27.280 --> 2:08:33.840]  and senate they can get to conference it has a 90 chance and that's a dead reckoning no one's sure
[2:08:33.840 --> 2:08:45.440]  sure of passing and being on obama's desk in the first couple weeks of 2010 so that is coming
[2:08:45.440 --> 2:08:51.040]  up we're going to be we're going to be breaking that down again headline senate health bill
[2:08:51.040 --> 2:09:00.400]  passes major test health plans on collision course with the house also coming up senator
[2:09:00.400 --> 2:09:07.280]  says white house foes of health care bill are birthers right wingers militias arian groups
[2:09:07.920 --> 2:09:11.440]  and that's what the mayac and homeland security report says it says if you don't like the federal
[2:09:11.440 --> 2:09:17.760]  reserve ripping you off if you don't like obama spending more money in the last year or less than
[2:09:17.760 --> 2:09:24.800]  all presidents before him combined you are a danger to the country and so that is coming up
[2:09:25.680 --> 2:09:29.360]  look i want to just play there's two parts we're just going to play the first part from youtube
[2:09:29.360 --> 2:09:39.280]  of cnn and former microsoft had talk of geoengineering the planet part one of two and for read
[2:09:41.520 --> 2:09:49.120]  zacharia talks with the former chief technology officer of microsoft and they talk about how easy
[2:09:49.120 --> 2:09:56.480]  it is to put up these giant blimps up into the upper atmosphere putting out sulfur dioxide
[2:09:56.480 --> 2:10:02.720]  to negate the effects of carbon dioxide now out in the open they're talking about geoengineering
[2:10:02.720 --> 2:10:12.960]  terraforming the issue is they're already using this they've already got weather modification
[2:10:12.960 --> 2:10:17.440]  blimps up in fact i printed it last night and wanted and meant to give it to you this morning
[2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:23.600]  when i was here at like 10 the headline was to define one of the articles was a ufo over salt lake
[2:10:23.600 --> 2:10:31.520]  and it's a giant blimp these blimps are on record flying around spraying the atmosphere and
[2:10:31.520 --> 2:10:37.040]  surveilling people i got i have the washington post new york times six seven years ago when they
[2:10:37.040 --> 2:10:41.600]  announced they were putting these blimps up for multiple reasons but then the local news they
[2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:46.720]  call the air force and say what what is this they go we don't know so the locals go it's a flying
[2:10:46.720 --> 2:10:54.320]  saucer same thing over russia you can see the propellers on the thing they use propellers even
[2:10:54.320 --> 2:11:01.760]  on the most high-tech blimps you can see the blisters of solar panels on the sides to power it
[2:11:01.760 --> 2:11:06.560]  these are unmanned giant blimps that stay up for years so they announced they deploy them
[2:11:06.560 --> 2:11:13.520]  then make it classified and the public's like martians martians know it's surveillance and
[2:11:13.520 --> 2:11:19.040]  weather modification blimps and i go on shows like man cow nationally syndicated and he makes fun of
[2:11:19.040 --> 2:11:25.360]  me saying it doesn't exist even though i give them the articles i'm the crazy man i'm the crazy man
[2:11:25.360 --> 2:11:32.880]  in psychology today believing in this because i in fact just google for everybody on tv right now
[2:11:35.760 --> 2:11:39.120]  after you do ufo over salt lake i printed it last night to be in the printer
[2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:47.280]  jaren's got the video google this homeland security launches blimps you'll get msnbc watch
[2:11:48.160 --> 2:11:55.200]  homeland security launches blimps and you'll see a giant blimp being launched over dc rising up
[2:11:55.840 --> 2:12:02.640]  in the photo from msnbc and it literally hundreds of other so six seven eight years ago they
[2:12:02.640 --> 2:12:07.840]  announced all this now the blimps are everywhere and people are in dalis and people are in salt lake
[2:12:07.840 --> 2:12:16.320]  and people are in moscow going aliens aliens there it is uav satellites blimps homeland security
[2:12:16.320 --> 2:12:23.360]  that's from homeland security newswire rathion blimp ideal for surveillance cruise missions detection
[2:12:26.560 --> 2:12:34.560]  so you guys found a bunch of them but uh the point is all of this is going on add source msnbc
[2:12:34.560 --> 2:12:43.760]  after it or newsweek because i want them oh you found msnbc oh oh again super blimps that's not
[2:12:43.760 --> 2:12:48.960]  the same article eyes in the sky for homeland security scroll down they may have just taken
[2:12:48.960 --> 2:12:56.080]  the photo off there's a bunch of them's my point so and they do this they announce a world government
[2:12:56.080 --> 2:13:01.680]  then they say it doesn't exist here could give you talk about it they announce in 1992 a scientist
[2:13:01.680 --> 2:13:06.560]  won a Nobel prize or was it 93 we've covered this and i'm doing research the last few years on
[2:13:06.560 --> 2:13:14.400]  chemtrails for a film i'm making and they admit that they have adding the jet fuel so that the
[2:13:14.400 --> 2:13:19.280]  air traffic controllers don't know the pilots don't know there's only three or four big manufacturers
[2:13:19.280 --> 2:13:26.320]  of the jet fuel for your mainline airports it's added it's designed to disperse nuclei for cloud
[2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:37.840]  formation ammonium sulfur dioxide barium salts aluminum dioxide and it disperses it into the
[2:13:37.840 --> 2:13:43.600]  atmosphere and so by 95 they launched tests and suddenly people went i never saw a condensation
[2:13:43.600 --> 2:13:48.160]  trail last more than a minute or two that things but up there for five hours it's turned into a
[2:13:48.160 --> 2:13:54.560]  cloud bank well what's going on and then the white house science r comes out his first speech
[2:13:54.560 --> 2:14:01.680]  to an ap meeting there it is eyes in the sky for homeland security the exact photo i told you about
[2:14:02.640 --> 2:14:07.120]  that's from 2005 homeland security blimps and look at it over the washington monument
[2:14:07.680 --> 2:14:12.800]  blow that up for folks please see but then i go on national radio shows and get made fun of
[2:14:13.840 --> 2:14:20.320]  the public wants to believe it's flying saucers in fact since i'm already covering this let's go
[2:14:20.320 --> 2:14:27.360]  ahead and uh i sent you several clips from abc news and others where they're going is it flying
[2:14:27.360 --> 2:14:34.240]  saucers you know is it aliens and they got these things over moscow now when you watch the cnn piece
[2:14:34.240 --> 2:14:41.360]  they show giant v-shaped blimps and those are the really big ones they go up to 100 000 feet or higher
[2:14:41.360 --> 2:14:47.920]  and just hover around in circles and uh it's it's so high up you got to have a telescope to look at
[2:14:47.920 --> 2:14:53.760]  them uh i mean literally if i had the time i could they've got one over dallas it looks at all of
[2:14:53.760 --> 2:14:58.880]  texas i could drive up there on a clear day scan around with it with a filter because it's white
[2:14:58.880 --> 2:15:03.920]  you got to see it behind the background with like a brown filter i took astronomy in school and
[2:15:03.920 --> 2:15:09.120]  i own a couple telescopes the point is and i could look around and find them and i could put it on
[2:15:09.120 --> 2:15:14.000]  the news and people would think it was a giant alien craft no but but but notice it's the same thing
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:19.360]  they just saw over moscow was one of the blimps taking off and of course the russians have them
[2:15:19.360 --> 2:15:27.120]  but the really high tequins are are are v-shaped giant and cnn shows these in the piece coming up
[2:15:27.120 --> 2:15:31.840]  but but first that's one of the more primitive design ones of homeland security right there on
[2:15:31.840 --> 2:15:37.440]  screen i sent you a bunch of clips just just show one of the local news clips of salt lake city
[2:15:37.440 --> 2:15:45.760]  where they think you know the government won't say what it is but uh but is it aliens or is it
[2:15:45.760 --> 2:15:53.920]  a secret craft it's a blimp it's a blimp it's a blimp i'm not the conspiracy theorist i have the
[2:15:53.920 --> 2:16:02.800]  facts why does the public believe it's aliens instead of a blimp here it is giant ufo over salt
[2:16:02.800 --> 2:16:09.360]  lake this is one of the shorter clips you can go watch longer ones go ahead turn it up what's
[2:16:09.360 --> 2:16:16.080]  hovering over salt lake city is in a rocket a blimp a ufo a strange object seen in the skies
[2:16:16.080 --> 2:16:21.520]  has residents scratching their heads the craft floated overhead for several minutes before
[2:16:21.520 --> 2:16:26.880]  disappearing salt lake air traffic controllers said their radar didn't pick up anything and they have
[2:16:26.880 --> 2:16:33.680]  no knowledge yes see that's the issue i mean you look it's a blimp with tail fins looks like the
[2:16:33.680 --> 2:16:41.280]  hannonburg it's got propellers on it i mean this would be like if the red baron landed a biplane
[2:16:41.280 --> 2:16:47.440]  a red biplane in front of your house and the news came and showed it and said we don't know what
[2:16:47.440 --> 2:16:54.640]  this craft is it'd be like if a 777 landed at george w bush or hw bush airport in houston and
[2:16:54.640 --> 2:17:00.400]  everyone ran on the tarmac saying we don't know what this is see they treat you like your morons
[2:17:01.760 --> 2:17:06.720]  and there's longer there's like a nine minute abc newscast where they marvel and the government
[2:17:06.720 --> 2:17:12.080]  won't say what it is and maybe it's a ufo and the government said they didn't see anything
[2:17:12.080 --> 2:17:18.960]  they treat you like children and just tell you it doesn't exist in your seeing things when giant
[2:17:18.960 --> 2:17:25.120]  blimps are flying around now i've looked into this story from a few years ago and i looked into the
[2:17:25.120 --> 2:17:32.880]  dalas stories and clearly they have military bases there they are launching blimps and they're only
[2:17:32.880 --> 2:17:41.280]  seen when they launch because when they go up to 100 to 120 000 feet they are tiny and people with
[2:17:41.280 --> 2:17:47.680]  telescopes there's literally hundreds of videos online where people with telescopes run around
[2:17:47.680 --> 2:17:53.520]  freaking out thinking they found ufo's and people with powerful telescopes privately owned keep seeing
[2:17:53.520 --> 2:17:59.920]  giant craft orbiting the earth and you look at the photos of them it's giant space stations
[2:18:00.640 --> 2:18:05.040]  90 plus percent of the space program in the us and russia has always been military
[2:18:06.160 --> 2:18:12.080]  they've got space planes i mean you really think virgin galactic a virgin atlantic is the only
[2:18:12.080 --> 2:18:19.200]  only group that has space planes a private airline company has a couple spaceships and they
[2:18:19.200 --> 2:18:25.440]  launch missions into space for tourists but the government doesn't have a space plane and nasa
[2:18:25.440 --> 2:18:30.000]  can't get one off the ground give me a break verner von bran in the 20s and 30s drew up the
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:35.280]  space shuttle in germany when he was the head of the german and then hit larian program in the 30s
[2:18:35.280 --> 2:18:42.000]  he was the head of nasa's program that is an ancient tinker toy that you are shown
[2:18:42.560 --> 2:18:47.840]  the reason they go with blimps is because they're so inexpensive it's much cheaper to have surveillance
[2:18:47.840 --> 2:18:55.200]  blisters uh infrared scanners and and and uh face scanners and license plate readers and weather
[2:18:55.200 --> 2:19:02.000]  modification packages on blimps than it is to launch them with payloads because the space
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:06.160]  planes are not good at bringing large payloads up from the intel i have uh but though they have
[2:19:06.160 --> 2:19:10.240]  some larger space planes now that are highly classified that have leaked uh still they use
[2:19:10.240 --> 2:19:15.120]  booster rockets to get them into the atmosphere but a blimp you put it up there in the edge of
[2:19:15.120 --> 2:19:21.600]  the atmosphere it's it's it's up above it can it can video and scan multiple states that's what's
[2:19:21.600 --> 2:19:33.520]  going on on record on record now when we come back they talk about kim trail blimps kim trail
[2:19:33.520 --> 2:19:42.000]  blimps with the former chief technology officer of microsoft about geoengineering from cnn we're
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:47.280]  just going to come back go right into this clip and we'll go out to break i'll come back on the other
[2:19:47.280 --> 2:19:54.160]  side of the bottom of the hour and comment on this the full video is linked at info wars.com
[2:19:56.400 --> 2:20:00.720]  you have a mortgage and a load of other debt wouldn't it be great if it all just went away
[2:20:00.720 --> 2:20:05.200]  no more mortgage can change your life we paid off all of our bills all your debt including your
[2:20:05.200 --> 2:20:10.320]  mortgage in as little as nine years with no more mortgage we will have saved over three hundred and
[2:20:10.320 --> 2:20:14.640]  thirteen thousand dollars in interest payments even have more money left over each month it lowered
[2:20:14.640 --> 2:20:19.520]  our monthly payments by a little over five hundred dollars no more mortgage where have
[2:20:19.520 --> 2:20:22.960]  they been all of our life if you knew about something like that you'd want to tell everybody

[2:22:07.120 --> 2:22:13.200]  confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system wisdom being lost with time the government
[2:22:13.200 --> 2:22:18.000]  we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business creating the
[2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:23.440]  largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced this is not only a transfer of
[2:22:23.440 --> 2:22:28.000]  power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government but has also caused the
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:33.040]  dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value now foreign governments are trying to divest

[2:23:52.560 --> 2:24:01.200]  today but i just can't see the world coming together to reduce co2 emissions to the levels
[2:24:01.200 --> 2:24:07.280]  that will actually stop it i can't see china or india doing it which in and of itself would doom
[2:24:07.280 --> 2:24:12.160]  the project and i really can't see western countries making the kinds of drastic changes
[2:24:12.160 --> 2:24:18.240]  that would be required to cut co2 emissions and if we did there are still lots of co2 up in the
[2:24:18.240 --> 2:24:24.320]  atmosphere right now and it will cause global warming anyway all of which made me want to know
[2:24:24.320 --> 2:24:30.560]  are there other approaches are there other strategies we might pursue in that spirit and in the wake
[2:24:30.560 --> 2:24:36.480]  of the copenhagen summit here is a fascinating conversation a fascinating set of ideas concrete
[2:24:36.480 --> 2:24:42.720]  ideas to solve the problem of global warming and energy without going down the copenhagen
[2:24:42.720 --> 2:24:49.840]  co2 route or in addition to going down the copenhagen co2 route nathan mirvold you've been you've
[2:24:49.840 --> 2:24:56.240]  been looking into the issue of global warming um and you've brought all your expertise i mean
[2:24:56.240 --> 2:25:01.520]  you're a trained physicist you spent years as the chief technology officer at microsoft so you
[2:25:01.520 --> 2:25:07.680]  understand the science the economics um what is it that you do you think when you look at what is
[2:25:07.680 --> 2:25:13.840]  going on what was going on in copenhagen here's the real problem uh or one of the many aspects of
[2:25:13.840 --> 2:25:20.720]  the problem when you emit co2 a good fraction of it at least 20 percent maybe even a little more
[2:25:20.720 --> 2:25:26.880]  will stay for thousands of years uh so it's not like it goes up and then it can go away after a
[2:25:26.880 --> 2:25:32.800]  little bit uh as we continue to emit co2 it continues to make the problem worse and then
[2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:38.320]  even if we stopped cold turkey it'll be there for a long period of time if you wanted a problem
[2:25:38.320 --> 2:25:45.040]  that was almost perfectly designed to be difficult for us to grapple with this would be it because
[2:25:45.040 --> 2:25:53.040]  the cost is very high um the solution is going to require a lot of sacrifice but the benefit
[2:25:53.040 --> 2:26:00.320]  is diffuse and global and way out in the future and that's the kind of problem humans are bad at
[2:26:00.320 --> 2:26:06.400]  but and that's why you have a fundamental problem with the idea the whole approach of
[2:26:06.400 --> 2:26:11.280]  limiting carbon emissions as the solution to global warming i think that you have to be
[2:26:11.280 --> 2:26:18.320]  an incredible optimist or you have to believe that it's not a a severe problem to think that
[2:26:18.320 --> 2:26:24.880]  that's the only solution we should investigate right now okay this building has fire extinguishers
[2:26:24.880 --> 2:26:30.000]  and a fire system but it's probably unlikely there'll be a fire today it's a low probability
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:36.640]  event but it's important enough that we really have to have all of this infrastructure and
[2:26:36.640 --> 2:26:44.400]  alarms and and firemen that will race up here and so forth because although it's okay we're
[2:26:44.400 --> 2:26:47.840]  going to come back and play the rest of it but i want to just counter what you just heard
[2:26:48.480 --> 2:26:53.440]  and for people watching at prismplanet.tv on the screen when they introduce him
[2:26:53.440 --> 2:27:04.240]  they say a new plan to save the world so they're now going from saying the oceans may rise by a few
[2:27:04.240 --> 2:27:14.320]  inches and a few polar bears might die which is an extreme fraud to putting out the visual idea
[2:27:14.320 --> 2:27:24.000]  the asinine statement that the planet may be destroyed ambitious plan to save the planet on
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:31.440]  screen they're saying we are saving the planet and then the microsoft former head of technology says
[2:27:32.320 --> 2:27:40.560]  but we have a plan and when we come back we're going to play that where they show these giant
[2:27:40.560 --> 2:27:50.720]  blimps to spray sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere now how can the globalist the un the united states
[2:27:51.600 --> 2:27:58.000]  britain go and put up these blimps at the north and south pole as he says they're going to do
[2:27:59.200 --> 2:28:07.920]  without asking the rest of the world also what are these kim trail devices these aerosol devices
[2:28:07.920 --> 2:28:13.600]  really going to do he talks about tipping points that's what the father of weather weapons meteorologist
[2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:20.000]  ben livingston who flooded vietnam during the war who created hurricanes weakened hurricanes now
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:27.200]  declassified came on this show and explained to you that it's tipping points they can manipulate
[2:28:27.200 --> 2:28:31.760]  we already know there's a giant covert weather modification program that john p holder in the
[2:28:31.760 --> 2:28:38.240]  white house science are now admits was just a test that they're now going operational so see
[2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:43.920]  they now have to introduce it to you now what they don't tell you upfront is that bill gates
[2:28:45.520 --> 2:28:48.240]  and let's search this during the break and show people when we come back
[2:28:48.240 --> 2:28:57.040]  owns patents on hurricane killing systems or hurricane strengthening systems the search would be
[2:28:57.040 --> 2:29:05.440]  the bill gates patents hurricane weather control i forget the exact headlines he also has the
[2:29:05.440 --> 2:29:10.720]  patents on this so this is his corporate minion and of course microsoft itself is an nsa slash
[2:29:10.720 --> 2:29:16.800]  cia front so is ibm that's come out on record and so the globalists are going to play god
[2:29:16.800 --> 2:29:21.920]  they're going to control your weather harp i've had the director of harp on admitting that they
[2:29:21.920 --> 2:29:28.320]  can ignite the atmosphere with harp then during the break the air force came on the line griped at
[2:29:28.320 --> 2:29:33.760]  him and said don't talk about that john harman heard that the guy running the show up in minnesota
[2:29:33.760 --> 2:29:38.720]  i'm down here in austin i thought i'd get john on to talk about that i always talk about having
[2:29:38.720 --> 2:29:44.560]  to talk about but we should have him on but the issue is there is weather modification going on
[2:29:44.560 --> 2:29:49.760]  we're going to come back and finish up with this we're on the march the empires on the run
[2:29:49.760 --> 2:29:53.440]  Alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:29:56.160 --> 2:30:00.720]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[2:30:00.720 --> 2:30:05.040]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:30:05.040 --> 2:30:10.080]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[2:30:10.080 --> 2:30:15.680]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[2:30:15.680 --> 2:30:20.800]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:30:20.800 --> 2:30:26.080]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[2:30:26.080 --> 2:30:30.720]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[2:30:30.720 --> 2:30:36.080]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[2:30:36.080 --> 2:30:40.480]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[2:30:40.480 --> 2:30:46.080]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com
[2:30:46.080 --> 2:30:51.120]  that's my solar backup dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar
[2:30:51.120 --> 2:30:58.560]  backup dot com or call one eight seven seven three two seven zero three six five hi folks this is
[2:30:58.560 --> 2:31:03.840]  alex jones and i want to tell you about the silver lungs generator now you can produce pure and endless
[2:31:03.840 --> 2:31:09.200]  colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution
[2:31:09.200 --> 2:31:14.160]  through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and
[2:31:14.160 --> 2:31:20.320]  viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano
[2:31:20.320 --> 2:31:26.640]  silver solutions and also delivers the silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream
[2:31:26.640 --> 2:31:32.560]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure
[2:31:32.560 --> 2:31:38.160]  and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow step by step

[2:32:01.600 --> 2:32:07.760]  last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[2:32:07.760 --> 2:32:13.680]  underneath the americans at home and have turned men's influence on our president in congress and
[2:32:13.680 --> 2:32:19.680]  they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens
[2:32:19.680 --> 2:32:26.160]  to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[2:32:26.160 --> 2:32:31.520]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[2:32:31.520 --> 2:32:36.320]  bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make
[2:32:36.320 --> 2:32:43.280]  the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc we have seen a fall
[2:32:43.280 --> 2:32:49.920]  of the republic yet your copy of full of the republic on dvd at info wars dot com we're watching
[2:32:49.920 --> 2:33:05.440]  online right now in super high quality at prison planet dot tv up on screen for prison
[2:33:05.440 --> 2:33:11.760]  planet dot tv viewers you can read the headline us say today hurricane calming technology
[2:33:12.480 --> 2:33:19.600]  bill gates has a plan and then you find out he has all these weather control patents because he's
[2:33:19.600 --> 2:33:26.320]  a government consortium front a shadow government front they give him all the patents they had
[2:33:26.320 --> 2:33:32.320]  decades ago everything he talks about everything they have in these patents is at least 30 years old
[2:33:32.320 --> 2:33:36.800]  the stanford research institute for the navy weapons laboratory
[2:33:38.400 --> 2:33:45.200]  had patents for doing exactly what they talk about here in 1967 that's now been declassified
[2:33:45.200 --> 2:33:50.720]  as of four years ago and i saw a story where the name ben livingston was in there as the father of
[2:33:50.720 --> 2:33:55.680]  weather weapons how they flooded vietnam when there were no clouds they were going to create them
[2:33:55.680 --> 2:34:03.600]  how in the 40s he flew with us was the first guy to fly into typhoons that are over 50 miles an
[2:34:03.600 --> 2:34:11.600]  hour in some cases even faster 200 miles an hour total again in the pacific the hurricanes get even
[2:34:11.600 --> 2:34:16.320]  more powerful they call them the typhoons he flew into those i mean this guy's amazing and we have
[2:34:16.320 --> 2:34:21.680]  that video interview by the way where they became to austin at prison planet dot tv they had all of
[2:34:21.680 --> 2:34:27.440]  this and so now they're introducing it to you oh we could put blimps up oh we've been testing with
[2:34:27.440 --> 2:34:34.240]  aircraft spraying oh this is a giant program in full swing and we know they're already manipulating
[2:34:34.240 --> 2:34:41.920]  the weather and the issue is they could create horrible catastrophic weather events with this
[2:34:43.840 --> 2:34:48.960]  that's on record and then tell you it's natural and scare everyone into submitting the global
[2:34:48.960 --> 2:34:55.840]  government this is literally the elite playing god that's what they're doing that's what they want
[2:34:55.840 --> 2:34:59.840]  that's why the pentagon calls it owning the weather and that's one of their declassified
[2:34:59.840 --> 2:35:06.240]  reports just google pentagon report owning the weather in 2025 they already own it folks here it is
[2:35:07.280 --> 2:35:13.200]  arms and and firemen that will race up here and so forth because although it's low probability
[2:35:13.200 --> 2:35:20.640]  it's severe in this case we don't even know what the probability is of how severe it can be without
[2:35:20.640 --> 2:35:25.200]  there being very severe consequences we also don't know when we're going to get around to
[2:35:25.200 --> 2:35:31.680]  getting serious so it seems to me that we need to have a plan b we need to have a way to buy
[2:35:31.680 --> 2:35:40.240]  ourselves some time if it starts getting serious quickly now what else could you do and the answer
[2:35:40.240 --> 2:35:46.960]  is a topic called geoengineering which is can we directly try to intervene so to use an analogy
[2:35:47.920 --> 2:35:52.400]  we all know we're supposed to eat right and exercise a lot and if we did that we would
[2:35:53.120 --> 2:35:57.120]  a lot of heart disease diabetes tons of other diseases we'd be better off
[2:35:58.240 --> 2:36:04.240]  turns out that's hard for people to do and as a result you also have interventions that you would
[2:36:04.240 --> 2:36:10.000]  do like heart surgery that you might do to get a stent put in or to have a bypass operation
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:15.440]  because if you neglect the problem long enough that's what you have to do well the equivalent of
[2:36:15.440 --> 2:36:22.080]  that surgery in this case our means to directly intervene now one approach is to take the co2
[2:36:22.080 --> 2:36:26.720]  and suck it out of the atmosphere so how do you do that we return or we turn actually to
[2:36:26.720 --> 2:36:35.760]  benjamin franklin in 1783 there's a volcano called laki in iceland i've been there to visit it
[2:36:35.760 --> 2:36:43.040]  that erupted causing a tremendous winter in 1784 in the northern hemisphere
[2:36:44.080 --> 2:36:50.800]  so benjamin franklin gives a paper he says it was the volcano well we know today through lots of
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:58.880]  how did he figure that out he has a great it's wonderful thing i wish i had the text to read
[2:36:58.880 --> 2:37:05.520]  here because it's in this sort of quaint english of that era where he says that it blocked the many
[2:37:05.520 --> 2:37:14.560]  rays of the sun and so far as we know today ben was right and we know this because in 1991
[2:37:14.560 --> 2:37:19.200]  a mount pinot tubo in the philippines exploded there's been lots of volcanoes since then but
[2:37:19.200 --> 2:37:25.520]  a very large volcano that's got a tremendous amount of power will put a lot of gases and
[2:37:25.520 --> 2:37:30.960]  particles into the very upper atmosphere the stratosphere mount pinot tubo did it caused
[2:37:30.960 --> 2:37:35.600]  global temperatures to drop by about one degree fahrenheit uh for about a year year and a half
[2:37:35.600 --> 2:37:41.120]  afterwards now that's interesting because that's about the amount of global warming
[2:37:41.120 --> 2:37:46.880]  though we have today so if you could just have a mountain to every year a mount pinot tubo on
[2:37:46.880 --> 2:37:53.920]  demand would do it and what is it doing what is the chemical process it's a spewing sulfur dioxide
[2:37:53.920 --> 2:38:02.640]  into the upper atmosphere why is that so when you have small aerosol particles light will
[2:38:02.640 --> 2:38:10.400]  scatter off of them that scattering is why one range of that sense why the sky is blue another
[2:38:10.400 --> 2:38:14.880]  range of that scattering is why milk is white actually so it turns out sulfur dioxide is very
[2:38:14.880 --> 2:38:20.320]  good at scattering light and if you have sulfur dioxide it's what gives the rotten egg smell
[2:38:20.320 --> 2:38:26.560]  in part or that and hydrogen sulfides uh at yellowstone or other places you have geysers
[2:38:28.880 --> 2:38:34.560]  enough of those particles will scatter light if you had a system for delivering sulfur dioxide
[2:38:35.120 --> 2:38:41.840]  into the upper atmosphere you could easily dim the earth by dim the sun by one percent
[2:38:41.840 --> 2:38:47.520]  and even do it in a way that wouldn't be visible so how do you pump sulfur dioxide into the upper
[2:38:47.520 --> 2:38:52.640]  atmosphere on demand the first things that you think of like all that's loaded into 747s and
[2:38:52.640 --> 2:38:59.920]  carry it up are way too expensive so you need a cheap way to get a lot of stuff up there so we
[2:38:59.920 --> 2:39:04.800]  set out to invent something like that we've come up with actually a couple ways to do it but i'll
[2:39:04.800 --> 2:39:11.520]  tell you the simplest one which is you run a hose to the sky it sounds nuts but you take a hose
[2:39:11.520 --> 2:39:20.960]  uh you suspend it on a series of balloons helium balloons you want to run it 25 kilometers up
[2:39:20.960 --> 2:39:27.600]  because that takes you up into the stratosphere now the 25 kilometer garden hose now that's the
[2:39:27.600 --> 2:39:35.440]  interesting part if you go through a calculation of how much you need in our uh our best scheme
[2:39:35.440 --> 2:39:41.200]  it's like a fat garden hose the total amount of rate that you're pumping is about 30 gallons
[2:39:41.200 --> 2:39:48.960]  a minute okay that's less than a swimming pool pump so it's actually a very manageable sized
[2:39:48.960 --> 2:39:55.760]  problem once you come up with this idea that you put the stuff up there the best place to put it
[2:39:55.760 --> 2:40:01.040]  is in very high latitudes that's very far north or in the summer southern hemisphere very far south
[2:40:01.600 --> 2:40:08.800]  so northern canada uh russia someplace like that that's up 60 70 degrees north so run one of these
[2:40:08.800 --> 2:40:15.040]  these garden hoses at the north pole basically one at the south pole turn them on every every year
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:21.680]  and and you've and you've solved the problem of global warming well we've done a series of computer
[2:40:21.680 --> 2:40:30.720]  simulations that tell us exactly that that uh one of these units at 60 to 70 north with a set of
[2:40:30.720 --> 2:40:36.800]  assumptions about how you put the um the aerosol up there uh would negate global warming as we
[2:40:36.800 --> 2:40:42.080]  have it today and by putting it up there would particularly protect the arctic and once you
[2:40:42.080 --> 2:40:48.560]  protect the arctic you shut off a bunch of these potential tipping point mechanisms once you cool
[2:40:48.560 --> 2:40:53.040]  the arctic our simulations show that in fact you draw enough heat from the rest of the hemisphere
[2:40:53.040 --> 2:40:58.480]  that you bring the rest of the the hemisphere into line and you don't have any severe dislocations
[2:40:58.480 --> 2:41:05.200]  of the weather and it's it's worth pointing out your stuff is all computer simulations
[2:41:05.200 --> 2:41:10.720]  but of course so are the predictions that the ipcc model uses to predict very bad
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:15.520]  stuff happening so if we believe those computer simulations there's no reason to assume yours
[2:41:15.520 --> 2:41:21.280]  are wrong well i i think yes that we use the same kind of computer simulations the same sort of
[2:41:21.280 --> 2:41:27.600]  software with the same sort of assumptions now neither one of them is perfect but it gives us
[2:41:27.600 --> 2:41:31.760]  confidence and at least as much confidence as we would have in the other directions now of course
[2:41:31.760 --> 2:41:35.920]  before you really deploy it you'd want to run some more simulations and you'd want to do some small
[2:41:35.920 --> 2:41:41.040]  scale experiments there's a lot of things to do to sort of responsibly build the full case
[2:41:41.040 --> 2:41:45.440]  but from what we can tell this is an idea that has incredible promise now our people
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:53.280]  our government's knocking on your doors so uh not so far and we will be back with Nathan
[2:41:53.280 --> 2:41:59.200]  merville more on global warming the future of energy and a way to power the whole world okay
[2:41:59.200 --> 2:42:06.080]  okay that's enough you can watch part two at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[2:42:06.720 --> 2:42:14.960]  or you can go directly uh to youtube and pull the cliff up it's seeing in a former microsoft head
[2:42:15.600 --> 2:42:22.400]  talk of geoengineering the planet okay i wrote some notes during that and i want to go over
[2:42:22.400 --> 2:42:25.920]  those notes then we're going to give the number out open the phones up and get into the government
[2:42:25.920 --> 2:42:33.120]  grab of health care and i'm not taking these in any particular order this is their way through
[2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:40.240]  the fear of global warming to not just tax you but set up a global agreement for weather modification
[2:42:40.240 --> 2:42:48.400]  and there's actually a 1970s un treating that the us and others signed on to on weather weapons
[2:42:48.960 --> 2:42:53.200]  so see while they've been telling you none of this existed now being declassified
[2:42:53.200 --> 2:42:58.480]  incrementally because they're getting ready to go public with it while they've been busy
[2:42:58.480 --> 2:43:03.200]  manipulating and testing all of this they now tell you that they're just now getting around
[2:43:03.200 --> 2:43:09.040]  to testing so they want to set up a global weather bureau and bill gates has been given
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:15.440]  all of the secret technologies because which now declassified five years ago four and a half years
[2:43:15.440 --> 2:43:21.440]  ago for sulfur dioxide from aircraft sulfur dioxide from blimps we have the documents
[2:43:21.440 --> 2:43:26.480]  associated press you name it reported on it i just said oh look there's ben libbinson they say
[2:43:26.480 --> 2:43:31.920]  he's the main inventor call him up yeah we we control hurricanes it was all certified i don't
[2:43:31.920 --> 2:43:36.880]  know why they let these hurricanes do what they did i talked to other meteorologists and experts
[2:43:36.880 --> 2:43:42.320]  they go yeah these hurricanes like katrina don't act like hurricanes normally do you got double eyes
[2:43:42.320 --> 2:43:49.200]  in some of them you know strange behavior aircraft scene spraying while this is going on they can
[2:43:49.200 --> 2:43:55.040]  strengthen them or weaken them so you have a global weather bureau they openly want to set up bill
[2:43:55.040 --> 2:44:00.320]  gates has now said this we predicted they would do this years ago because we know how they operate
[2:44:00.320 --> 2:44:05.520]  we have enough info we understand their program they create the crisis whether real or manufactured
[2:44:05.520 --> 2:44:14.880]  they offer the solution it goes on again they sell it all with climate fear the public thinks
[2:44:14.880 --> 2:44:20.080]  well if they're going to put blimps up in the upper atmosphere and aircraft and spray us
[2:44:20.080 --> 2:44:27.040]  why it must be real if the government's doing this it's a giant corporate boondoggle a new
[2:44:27.040 --> 2:44:32.320]  global weather bureau that will spend hundreds of billions a year on already going on secretly now
[2:44:32.320 --> 2:44:38.080]  being declassified it takes global agreements to get this set up which is what they want globalization
[2:44:39.360 --> 2:44:43.520]  it can also cover what they're doing and cover all their weather weapon
[2:44:43.520 --> 2:44:48.800]  programs that are happening nasa reported three years ago that the earth in the last decade
[2:44:49.360 --> 2:44:55.040]  has become 20 darker than in the hundred years it was accurately measured before that
[2:44:55.040 --> 2:44:59.840]  because there's all this new hazy cloud cover formed by the chemtrails that's just the low
[2:44:59.840 --> 2:45:07.280]  altitude aerosol spraying when i use chemtrail that's the colloquial common term for it they
[2:45:07.280 --> 2:45:11.600]  have literally thousands of documents that he classified this year where department of energy
[2:45:11.600 --> 2:45:17.360]  department of the army department of the air force they're just all out spraying globally
[2:45:17.360 --> 2:45:22.800]  and it's all black budget and secret how much they're spending it's giant program manipulating
[2:45:22.800 --> 2:45:28.800]  the weather the earth is now 20 darker at least i mean we're living in the middle of buck rogers
[2:45:28.800 --> 2:45:37.920]  folks but the general public doesn't understand it continuing he says yes we'll use the same
[2:45:37.920 --> 2:45:47.040]  software that we've used for the global warming models all centralized fraud driven by united
[2:45:47.040 --> 2:45:52.400]  nations groups so more scams you'll never know what they're really doing it's a cover for their
[2:45:52.400 --> 2:45:58.000]  weather weapons and weather manipulation and then they say oh well we'll test this on a small
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:02.480]  scale they've already been testing on a giant scale with harp and that's just one location
[2:46:02.480 --> 2:46:06.800]  they've got them in europe on record smaller stations all over the country where the pentagon
[2:46:06.800 --> 2:46:12.720]  admits they're testing it and ionizing the atmosphere along with the barium salts aluminum
[2:46:12.720 --> 2:46:17.920]  dioxide sulfur dioxide they're projecting when he said these things reflect back into space
[2:46:17.920 --> 2:46:24.240]  that's only a small part of it they also form nuclei for clouds that's the main driver according
[2:46:24.240 --> 2:46:31.680]  to the climatologist we've interviewed here it's the nuclei the potash other things that we put
[2:46:31.680 --> 2:46:39.520]  into the atmosphere form nuclei smokestacks forest fires but even more importantly space dust
[2:46:39.520 --> 2:46:45.200]  micro meteors coming in by the millions every day as a conservative estimate those are breaking up
[2:46:45.200 --> 2:46:50.240]  in the atmosphere forming nuclei that water particles freeze onto in the upper atmosphere
[2:46:50.240 --> 2:46:56.320]  becoming larger micro hail then as it comes into the lower atmosphere it heats back up
[2:46:56.320 --> 2:47:03.600]  creating water vapor that you know as clouds understanding this so when they say test on a
[2:47:03.600 --> 2:47:08.480]  small scale there's no way to test these technologies on a small scale and know what it's going to do
[2:47:08.480 --> 2:47:18.960]  in the giant terra scale or planetary geo scale okay so test on the small scale what a fraud
[2:47:18.960 --> 2:47:23.120]  they're already testing on a giant scale you just weren't supposed to know about it now they're
[2:47:23.120 --> 2:47:30.080]  going public with it namely because they want to publicly use it and since 1995 researchers
[2:47:30.080 --> 2:47:35.200]  meteorologists scientists people have gone up in aircraft behind the chemtrails they said it's
[2:47:35.200 --> 2:47:42.000]  barium salts aluminum dioxide sulfur dioxide it's being dispersed in jet fuel we've done studies
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:46.880]  you could clearly do this and have it disperse the nuclei then john p holder and white house
[2:47:46.880 --> 2:47:52.000]  science are who also wrote the book eco science calling for putting stuff in the water to sterilize
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:57.360]  you and your family and he wants a planetary government read his own book he comes out and says
[2:47:57.920 --> 2:48:03.200]  yeah uh we got jets they're going to spray the clouds and and create clouds to protect you from
[2:48:03.200 --> 2:48:10.240]  global warming three years ago government approved textbooks nationwide and public schools two of
[2:48:10.240 --> 2:48:15.840]  them came out for seventh and eighth graders used all over the country where they teach the kids the
[2:48:15.840 --> 2:48:22.160]  government is spraying trails to create sunscreen to protect you so see they're teaching the kids
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:30.640]  it's like time magazine for kids in two different issues one five years ago one three years ago
[2:48:30.640 --> 2:48:35.600]  that i know of i was sent this they have time magazine free for kids in school federal government
[2:48:35.600 --> 2:48:40.800]  pays for it and it says your parents don't understand the future they're old-fashioned but
[2:48:40.800 --> 2:48:45.360]  you're cool you're gonna take a microchip that you're gonna buy and sell with and then no one will
[2:48:45.360 --> 2:48:49.840]  be able to take your identity see they're teaching your kids their chemtrailing they're teaching your
[2:48:49.840 --> 2:48:53.840]  kids that microchips are good they're teaching your kids global warming is real and to come home
[2:48:53.840 --> 2:49:00.080]  and rebuke you that's on the news now we told you about it before it was on the news it's a total
[2:49:00.080 --> 2:49:05.520]  scientific dictatorship they're manipulating the weather they're manipulating our genetics i haven't
[2:49:05.520 --> 2:49:11.840]  even gotten to this yet last night we're up here working late on a film i ordered for the office
[2:49:11.840 --> 2:49:19.200]  a couple papa john's pizzas and i don't consider it total junk food but it certainly is fattening
[2:49:20.560 --> 2:49:25.680]  and the pizzas come in and i'm putting pepper i love pepper i'm dumping a whole packet of pepper
[2:49:26.640 --> 2:49:33.040]  on my pizza and i read the label and it says crushed red peppers treated with radiation
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:35.040]  zoom in on this for me
[2:49:35.040 --> 2:49:43.840]  crushed red peppers treated with radiation you're going what does that have to do with chemtrailing
[2:49:43.840 --> 2:49:48.560]  what does that do with genetic engineering ladies and gentlemen i can't describe to you the
[2:49:48.560 --> 2:49:59.120]  information i know that is publicly available and mainstream news i can't begin
[2:49:59.120 --> 2:50:12.240]  to eat i mean look i mentioned last night how five years ago in 2004 the epa approved spring live
[2:50:12.240 --> 2:50:21.520]  viruses on most meat and people don't believe me here's here's new york times agency approves
[2:50:21.520 --> 2:50:30.000]  first use of viruses as food additive live viruses here is abc news viral meat spray advancing food
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:36.080]  safety i have newscast where they say mercury is good for your children's brains and that melamine
[2:50:36.080 --> 2:50:43.440]  is good for babies when it kills people the government says that they want to put lithium
[2:50:43.440 --> 2:50:48.480]  in your water the government admittedly puts over 150 chemicals in your water already that
[2:50:48.480 --> 2:50:53.520]  caused cancer and sterilize you ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen do you understand
[2:50:53.520 --> 2:51:03.040]  what's going on this is big john lipscomb world government and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching
[2:51:03.040 --> 2:51:08.320]  the choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow i have

[2:52:08.720 --> 2:52:14.880]  americans at home i've turned the members influence on our president in congress and they really are
[2:52:14.880 --> 2:52:21.120]  calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention

[3:00:40.320 --> 3:00:47.040]  hollywood i think of tremendous publicity value on a great scale of magnitude if the numerous world
[3:00:47.040 --> 3:00:52.720]  famous hollywood stars who are opposed to the new world order agenda will come out publicly
[3:00:53.520 --> 3:00:59.680]  it would not counting your worthy self it would be the most devastating blow to new world order
[3:00:59.680 --> 3:01:05.280]  implementation that has yet occurred i'd like to ask all of you good people in hollywood to please
[3:01:05.280 --> 3:01:11.920]  come forward and assist the cause of truth and all of humanity is very survival mark i hear you
[3:01:11.920 --> 3:01:16.480]  and i appreciate your call for those that don't know michael braverman one of the executive
[3:01:16.480 --> 3:01:22.960]  producers on conspiracy theory uh was on with us today i'm a consultant on the show it's groundbreaking
[3:01:22.960 --> 3:01:29.680]  that's got on the air and he talked about the old fake left establishment doesn't want any new world
[3:01:29.680 --> 3:01:39.920]  order info on tv or on television or on movies cable broadcast tv whatever the case is and how
[3:01:39.920 --> 3:01:47.200]  this show from our perspective the true perspective is groundbreaking and i've talked about it a lot
[3:01:47.200 --> 3:01:54.320]  but he never brought up the fact that bruce willis brad pit woody harrelson and i threw those names
[3:01:54.320 --> 3:02:00.720]  down he went yeah that's the names how did you know that i told you folks you can't believe
[3:02:01.840 --> 3:02:10.000]  i told bruce willis i mean you heard uh because i i was never going to bring it up on air
[3:02:11.200 --> 3:02:17.120]  because it was private info but uh rick link letter felt like doing it so he did because
[3:02:17.120 --> 3:02:22.960]  nobody told him to keep it on the lowdown that bruce willis has been in austin making a movie with um
[3:02:22.960 --> 3:02:31.280]  um i was three years ago with uh my good friend rick link letter and and and this is like hollywood
[3:02:31.280 --> 3:02:37.600]  texas next to canada this is one of the biggest areas in the world for making films new zealand's
[3:02:37.600 --> 3:02:43.120]  another place australia but it's inexpensive to make films there's a lot of hollywood stars come
[3:02:43.120 --> 3:02:47.600]  through and they hear my radio show they see my access tv show years ago but in this case rick
[3:02:47.600 --> 3:02:53.440]  link letter gave a bunch of my films to bruce willis and bruce had a complete awakening to the
[3:02:53.440 --> 3:02:58.480]  left right paradigm and there's some other behind the scenes stuff i'm not going to get into as it
[3:02:58.480 --> 3:03:07.680]  was private but then whenever this is just one case example then whenever rick link letter talked
[3:03:07.680 --> 3:03:12.720]  about bruce willis's awakening from my films because rick's a big fan of the show and gave
[3:03:12.720 --> 3:03:20.240]  him a bunch of my films at the time terror storm and martial law that bruce said now i understand
[3:03:20.240 --> 3:03:24.240]  how both parties are controlled we talked about that michelle malcon came out and said it's impossible
[3:03:24.240 --> 3:03:30.240]  it can't be true but she didn't call bruce willis she just said it can't be true then bruce a few
[3:03:30.240 --> 3:03:33.680]  months later gave an interview to vanity fair and he said the same people that killed kennedy run
[3:03:33.680 --> 3:03:39.120]  america they control both parties i've had an awakening to the new world order now i didn't
[3:03:39.120 --> 3:03:46.400]  even bug rick or bruce to try to stay in contact with bruce willis and try to push it if bruce willis
[3:03:46.400 --> 3:03:50.480]  wants to find out how to get a hold of me wants to come on he can because i'm going to wake up the
[3:03:50.480 --> 3:03:54.880]  general public and i can't count on things that may or may not happen charlie sheen called me up
[3:03:54.880 --> 3:04:01.440]  out of the blue i'd never talked to him and said i want to go public and you know i sit there and
[3:04:01.440 --> 3:04:05.920]  talk to count of reeves what he herald sent a lot of other people over the years and you know they're
[3:04:05.920 --> 3:04:10.480]  they're all into this info they order my videos when they come out i'll you know i talk to them
[3:04:10.480 --> 3:04:14.800]  every once in a while and they go yeah i'll come on sometime but uh i'm you know i'm not sure
[3:04:15.360 --> 3:04:22.000]  because because they know that the establishment will try to hurt their careers as long as you
[3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:27.760]  want to be a fake leftist it's fine or be a right winger like tom selic it's fine but the point is
[3:04:27.760 --> 3:04:34.800]  all the old socialists are dying off in in hollywood and i'm telling you 80 percent or more of hollywood
[3:04:34.800 --> 3:04:41.200]  is anti-new world order this is all they talk about all they're into the awakenings accelerating
[3:04:41.200 --> 3:04:48.880]  and the globalists are in trouble there because the big studios are losing control of their people

[3:08:10.720 --> 3:08:16.640]  afternoon freedom fighter i was watching bloomberg news about 20 minutes ago they said uh the copenhagen
[3:08:16.640 --> 3:08:23.840]  deal uh kind of fell short which is uh great news and then last night at 12 17 central time
[3:08:23.840 --> 3:08:28.480]  i saw the scum known as the united states senators over 60 of them on the democratic side
[3:08:29.280 --> 3:08:34.560]  with the audacity to pass uh to pass this bill at midnight that's my comment my question to you sir
[3:08:34.560 --> 3:08:40.560]  is um i i mentioned this on jason berman's show last night but i think for you i think you guys
[3:08:40.560 --> 3:08:47.440]  need to bring on the air constitutional lawyers to see if we can as freedom fighters get set to
[3:08:47.440 --> 3:08:52.800]  press charges on the puppet master known as baraki st obama we clearly know that he violated
[3:08:52.800 --> 3:08:57.680]  the logan act by bringing president of the world at the u n and every bill he signs from then on
[3:08:57.680 --> 3:09:02.560]  including receiving the nobel peace prize without the consent of congress congress everything he's
[3:09:02.560 --> 3:09:08.000]  done after yeah that's a cash payment by a foreign group so after he's done all of that
[3:09:08.000 --> 3:09:12.880]  everything he's done after the u n meeting in new york city has been impeachable offenses
[3:09:12.880 --> 3:09:17.680]  against the constitution against the law and what they're doing is what nixon did right on up to
[3:09:17.680 --> 3:09:23.760]  obama now is they set the precedent to violate the constitution and get away with it so we
[3:09:23.760 --> 3:09:28.080]  i need to guide mark levin he's from new york he's a great constitutional lawyer he's a freedom
[3:09:28.080 --> 3:09:32.320]  fighter he goes after these people you get you need to get on some constitutional lawyers so we can
[3:09:32.320 --> 3:09:37.920]  get rid of these puppet masters and then at the same time but mark levin is also a neoconies pro war
[3:09:37.920 --> 3:09:42.320]  oh that's not good then well never mind about him but no i mean i mean that's okay it's just i'm
[3:09:42.320 --> 3:09:47.040]  just saying you know you've got the right wing all right now kind of as the patriots but remember
[3:09:47.040 --> 3:09:51.920]  what happens once they get in power we need to remove both leaderships because they're all
[3:09:51.920 --> 3:09:55.840]  rotten to the core but i'll tell you this obama has taken it to new levels i appreciate your

[3:10:59.200 --> 3:11:04.320]  pilots don't even know they're coming in on their regular runs and it's darkening the atmosphere
[3:11:04.320 --> 3:11:09.280]  and i just played cnn last hour with the former head of microsoft admitting that they on the
[3:11:09.280 --> 3:11:14.880]  patents are going to do it globally well i've been taking pictures of this over the last several
[3:11:14.880 --> 3:11:19.120]  days i'm going to send them in i'm also going to put them up on a website uh often like to uh

[3:11:28.320 --> 3:11:33.920]  between right and left and billions of new you know new tax taxations and uh government hopefully
[3:11:33.920 --> 3:11:38.960]  admitting it's got no control uh you know the president's basically willing to sign any bill
[3:11:38.960 --> 3:11:45.120]  in the order uh you know to play and that uh you know we've completely lost any uh sign of control
[3:11:45.120 --> 3:11:51.040]  or any reasoning no i hear you i hear you randy i hear you and i appreciate your call look bush
[3:11:51.040 --> 3:11:58.000]  tripled the size of government obama promised a cut government and spent more than bush clinton
[3:11:58.000 --> 3:12:09.680]  bush's daddy uh ronald reagan jimmy carter gerald ford uh nixon all the way back to
[3:12:09.680 --> 3:12:16.400]  george washington that's a fact of four trillion dollar deficit and counting in 2009
[3:12:17.840 --> 3:12:24.480]  that's just the deficit now not all the obligations and government health care and more wars and
[3:12:24.480 --> 3:12:32.080]  more taxes and carbon taxes it is a mass looting randy it is criminal government
[3:12:32.080 --> 3:12:36.560]  snatching and stealing everything that's even nailed down they're taking the kitchen sink
[3:12:36.560 --> 3:12:41.200]  they're pulling up the tile they're ripping out the wood paneling they are robbing us blind
[3:12:41.200 --> 3:12:46.160]  they are taking everything and leaving a police state behind as a rearguard action to protect
[3:12:46.160 --> 3:12:52.640]  themselves uh let's go ahead and uh talk to tony in illinois tony go ahead yeah it's great to talk to
[3:12:52.640 --> 3:12:57.280]  you uh you know it's funny you were mentioning about uh you're on mancow you know i'm from the
[3:12:57.280 --> 3:13:02.160]  chicago an area so i had a list so we obviously know who he is and when i heard you on there
[3:13:02.160 --> 3:13:06.080]  i knew right away you were you know the first shot in there but i told you you held your own
[3:13:06.080 --> 3:13:09.680]  you did great well no i mean i've been online i mean let me just make this point for you go on
[3:13:09.680 --> 3:13:16.720]  i've been on mancow show probably 50 60 70 maybe a hundred times i mean i'm on there almost every
[3:13:16.720 --> 3:13:21.040]  week they asked me to come on for 10 15 minutes i do it and he's invited me up there and he's
[3:13:21.040 --> 3:13:25.680]  invited me to events and he's nice it's just that he's still when i talk about the white house
[3:13:25.680 --> 3:13:30.240]  science are he gives a press conference and says we're terraforming the planet we're manipulating
[3:13:30.240 --> 3:13:37.600]  the weather and they have their guys on cnn he still laughs at me because i mean it's like
[3:13:37.600 --> 3:13:43.280]  mainstream media tells me there's no new world order being set up when i have a giant stack
[3:13:43.280 --> 3:13:49.520]  of mainstream news articles here in front of me today where they're calling for global government
[3:13:49.520 --> 3:13:54.880]  i mean that was the point i was making yeah you know what to it if you look at it you know you
[3:13:54.880 --> 3:13:59.760]  listen to the radio and even you know uh talk show hosts there's a lot to the right and they both
[3:13:59.760 --> 3:14:03.840]  argue with each other and they've gotten the american people so against each other because
[3:14:03.840 --> 3:14:07.920]  they argue they're left to the right side that they're not seeing what's in the middle like
[3:14:07.920 --> 3:14:11.760]  you know you're in the middle i'm in the middle and we're seeing what's going on here our country
[3:14:11.760 --> 3:14:15.600]  and they even give you a fake middle fake middle means you're a socialist instead of a communist
[3:14:15.600 --> 3:14:20.320]  uh you know the republicans or the socials the democrats the communists it's all command and
[3:14:20.320 --> 3:14:25.680]  control i'm not in the left right or middle i'm outside their fake paradigm i'm anti-corruption
[3:14:26.560 --> 3:14:31.520]  yeah exactly anti-corruption pro-constitution let's get this country back on track which
[3:14:31.520 --> 3:14:36.720]  sometimes seems like it's an impossible feat but if we keep up a good fight i believe we we should
[3:14:36.720 --> 3:14:41.200]  out we should overcome this and hopefully you know we keep spreading the word your word my word
[3:14:41.200 --> 3:14:45.120]  and i try to keep everyone as formed as possible when you come on and you give your
[3:14:45.120 --> 3:14:49.520]  all your data and you say here's the data right here right in front of me you can look up yourself
[3:14:49.520 --> 3:14:52.800]  sometimes people are too lazy to do that but that's what you want people to do
[3:14:52.800 --> 3:14:57.040]  so if you actually read it online or read that government piece of paper you have there
[3:14:57.040 --> 3:15:01.120]  and you know what is it that's legitimate and that's how we convince people the truth and what's
[3:15:01.120 --> 3:15:08.000]  going on i hear you and i appreciate your call let's go ahead and talk to trint in canada trint
[3:15:08.000 --> 3:15:13.920]  you're on the air hi you know and with the establishment coming forward and uh he's stating
[3:15:13.920 --> 3:15:18.480]  that they're doing the spraying yeah how is it that we uh don't know for sure that they're the
[3:15:18.480 --> 3:15:22.880]  ones that are responsible for this alleged climate change or whatever is happening that they figure
[3:15:22.880 --> 3:15:27.280]  is wrong and that's what i'm pointing out a lot of the stuff that's happening in the states right
[3:15:27.280 --> 3:15:32.560]  now uh is a lot of stuff that happened in canada back in the 80s you know with the gst being
[3:15:32.560 --> 3:15:37.840]  put in and the gun registration happening and you know i think it's a matter of having the the
[3:15:37.840 --> 3:15:43.440]  u.s. equalized with canada for the north american union i think that's what globalization is that's
[3:15:43.440 --> 3:15:49.200]  what they say is is taking americans and canadians and british rights so we can be like all the other
[3:15:49.200 --> 3:15:55.840]  countries that live under tyranny yeah are they planning to uh have this also be uh equalized
[3:15:55.840 --> 3:16:02.480]  like with the uh the european union yes in fact it's in my film in game blueprint for global
[3:16:02.480 --> 3:16:09.040]  enslavement now out for three years we show a press conference with merkel and buroso of the EU

[3:26:40.160 --> 3:26:47.760]  they're trying to like accelerate an ice age what do you think of that john p holdren the white house
[3:26:47.760 --> 3:26:54.320]  science are believe we were going to have an ice age in the 70s and we are the evidence shows tipping
[3:26:54.320 --> 3:26:59.920]  towards we're at the end of a 12 year war a 12 000 year warming cycle and they know the main ice age
[3:27:00.720 --> 3:27:06.960]  the glacial periods come every 12 000 years we've been in an interglacial period and all of the
[3:27:06.960 --> 3:27:13.200]  chem trail spring does cool the earth and the earth has been cooling for nine years uh and they know
[3:27:13.200 --> 3:27:19.440]  that so yes i mean there's no telling what they're doing they just admit they've had a long term
[3:27:19.440 --> 3:27:26.240]  global secret weather modification program going on that's what's wrong with shadow national security
[3:27:26.240 --> 3:27:31.520]  government we don't know what the truth is these people have unlimited funding they do whatever
[3:27:31.520 --> 3:27:38.480]  they want they're playing god absolutely another thing uh you talked about the uh what they do
[3:27:38.480 --> 3:27:44.960]  with the food i work in the restaurant industry and the fryer oil they put silicone in it's called
[3:27:44.960 --> 3:27:50.640]  dimethyl polycylizane it's silicone like what they use in breast implants and when you heat it up to
[3:27:50.640 --> 3:27:56.640]  about 300 degrees it uh it turns into formaldehyde which is cancer causing let me stop you for a
[3:27:56.640 --> 3:28:01.360]  minute i've read about the the special ingredients and a lot of french fry oil french fry oil being
[3:28:01.360 --> 3:28:06.960]  carcinogens you're telling me because the stuff they put in breast implants is poisonous you're
[3:28:06.960 --> 3:28:12.960]  telling me that's in the frying fryer grease absolutely and they actually put it in yeah they
[3:28:12.960 --> 3:28:18.400]  actually put it in the cheese if you just type in pizza hut in silicone there's uh an article on
[3:28:18.400 --> 3:28:23.280]  wrench.com about how pizza hut puts it in their cheese and then they're giving it to the school
[3:28:23.280 --> 3:28:27.360]  kids so that might be well i've got to read that because that's that's questionable source but i
[3:28:27.360 --> 3:28:32.800]  will uh i will check into that for myself i i appreciate it uh that is just uh that is just
[3:28:32.800 --> 3:28:40.400]  amazing amazing information i mean i don't doubt it uh but i have to look at that uh for my for
[3:28:40.400 --> 3:28:51.440]  myself that's um i mean who knows in fact where did it go i had my papa john's pepper that i was
[3:28:51.440 --> 3:28:56.800]  putting on my cheese pizza and it says crushed red pepper is treated with radiation i'm going to cover
[3:28:56.800 --> 3:29:01.280]  that after i come back and talk to john and pa john and florida michael in california and a few
[3:29:01.280 --> 3:29:06.320]  others then i'm going to briefly get into the latest on health care and then i'm going to uh

[3:33:23.440 --> 3:33:29.920]  get into a small snapshot it's many times worse than i can even describe of what's in your water
[3:33:29.920 --> 3:33:33.840]  what's in your food what's happening then i'm going to briefly hit the latest on health care
[3:33:33.840 --> 3:33:38.320]  and then talk to john michael dan michael george and others that are patiently holding
[3:33:38.320 --> 3:33:46.960]  for over 100 years the eugenicist out of england the us in germany hitler was only one brand of it
[3:33:46.960 --> 3:33:53.040]  have been setting up health departments secretly taking dna samples from babies for the last 37
[3:33:53.040 --> 3:33:58.640]  years that's now been declassified and been in the news they wrote literally hundreds of government
[3:33:58.640 --> 3:34:03.120]  white papers we've covered here in the 50s where they said we want to put chemicals in the water
[3:34:03.120 --> 3:34:10.800]  to reduce fertility to sterilize people and to dump people down and to reduce their life expectancy
[3:34:12.400 --> 3:34:19.520]  and all over the country drugs have been found in reservoirs at levels in some cases hundreds of
[3:34:19.520 --> 3:34:25.280]  times what they could be from sewage runoff they've been found in mountain reservoirs this has been
[3:34:25.280 --> 3:34:32.800]  in the associated press where it's original water original rainwater original glacier water original
[3:34:32.800 --> 3:34:39.280]  mountain snow runoff there is no sewage involved it's original source water and there's prozac
[3:34:39.280 --> 3:34:44.720]  and birth control and other things in it now the u.s. government's proposed putting prozac in the
[3:34:44.720 --> 3:34:49.760]  water serotonin reuptake inhibitor type drugs we've played those news clips the japanese
[3:34:49.760 --> 3:34:54.320]  government's been considering it they've now been pushing putting lithium in the water which is an
[3:34:54.320 --> 3:35:00.080]  anti-psychotic and talking about how natural it is and how it's no big deal and how it helps in
[3:35:00.080 --> 3:35:04.880]  suicide they're talking about putting anti cholesterol statins in the water it's now coming
[3:35:04.880 --> 3:35:09.840]  out statins don't really mess with your cholesterol too much that most cholesterol is good and that
[3:35:09.840 --> 3:35:16.880]  is causing liver problems and that's mainstream news so because myself and others have been
[3:35:16.880 --> 3:35:23.600]  exposing what they're putting in the water what gmo foods doing from the real science because all
[3:35:23.600 --> 3:35:29.040]  of this has been coming out they're going from denying they're putting things in our water to
[3:35:29.040 --> 3:35:37.600]  coming out and saying leadin toys is good melamine isn't bad for kids even though it kills them and
[3:35:37.600 --> 3:35:45.280]  causes kidney failure mercury in shots actually helps your brain doesn't harm it uh yeah we are
[3:35:45.280 --> 3:35:50.800]  looking at putting stuff in your water and they're irradiating more and more food they're spraying
[3:35:50.800 --> 3:35:56.240]  live viruses on food i want to go over all these mainstream media sources where they throw it in
[3:35:56.240 --> 3:36:04.560]  your face but first off to give you an idea about how prolific this is last night we're up here late
[3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:10.160]  i order a couple papa john's pizzas for the office after my sunday show we're up here
[3:36:10.160 --> 3:36:15.680]  working on a film actually two films i'm working on my film jason mermas is working on his
[3:36:17.760 --> 3:36:22.480]  and i say i'll order some pizzas i'm putting red pepper on my pizza
[3:36:22.480 --> 3:36:28.640]  and after i've already eaten a couple pieces of cheese pizza i look down and it says
[3:36:29.520 --> 3:36:38.560]  crushed red peppers by papa john's crushed red peppers treated with radiation and then it's
[3:36:38.560 --> 3:36:45.200]  got a symbol of a flower oh radiation's a flower i'm gonna lay this here on the table on the broadcast
[3:36:45.200 --> 3:36:54.320]  desk so the document cam can zoom right in on that for everyone watching crushed red peppers treated
[3:36:55.120 --> 3:37:03.920]  with radiation and i wish i had an unused uh package so i can show it where i don't have
[3:37:03.920 --> 3:37:08.880]  the corner ripped off like i do there but uh there's no way to focus a little bit better i guess
[3:37:08.880 --> 3:37:18.080]  crushed red peppers treated treated with with radiation now they tried to get a radiation
[3:37:18.640 --> 3:37:25.600]  of food past in the fifties they had all this nuclear weapons waste high power radioactive
[3:37:25.600 --> 3:37:33.200]  material they don't mix actual radiation granules radioactive substances in they run food for just
[3:37:33.200 --> 3:37:37.680]  a few seconds through high power radiation beams that would kill you deader in a hammer if you were
[3:37:37.680 --> 3:37:44.240]  in the radiation and it kills bacteria kills other things and this is so the food companies
[3:37:44.240 --> 3:37:48.080]  scientists and the government wouldn't let them do it till it was it will you prove ready a radiation
[3:37:48.080 --> 3:37:54.640]  eight years ago because the studies all over the world showed it destroyed the the the the value of
[3:37:54.640 --> 3:38:00.640]  the food it killed the living enzymes in there the ring structures the cofactors they did rat
[3:38:00.640 --> 3:38:08.960]  studies with it big problems but this is crushed red pepper why irradiated well and most of the meat
[3:38:08.960 --> 3:38:12.880]  your eating's been irradiated a lot of the vegetables you're eating have been irradiated
[3:38:12.880 --> 3:38:19.920]  this is only the tip of the iceberg the g the gmo tomatoes and and corn that they've mixed animal
[3:38:19.920 --> 3:38:26.480]  and insect in with cross species genetic engineering they've crossed pigs and humans uh they've they've
[3:38:26.480 --> 3:38:31.360]  they've crossed spiders and goats to create body armor they won't believe me uh search engine
[3:38:32.240 --> 3:38:36.400]  spider goats cbs news associated press let's let's show them a photo of a part spider part
[3:38:36.400 --> 3:38:42.000]  goat for body armor production just anything you can imagine is going on they've released fish in
[3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:47.920]  the open sea that are part insect part plant uh it gives rise to superviruses it gives rise to
[3:38:47.920 --> 3:38:54.240]  super mutations in bacteria this is the true environmental threat now here's an article
[3:38:54.240 --> 3:39:02.880]  from the associated press august 19 2006 this was approved in l5 agency approves first use
[3:39:02.880 --> 3:39:07.920]  of viruses as food additive a mix of bacteria killing viruses maybe sprayed on cold cuts
[3:39:08.800 --> 3:39:14.720]  wieners and sausages is actually approved for all meat to combat common microbes that kill
[3:39:14.720 --> 3:39:18.880]  hundreds of people a year federal officials ruled friday the food and rug administration
[3:39:18.880 --> 3:39:28.400]  approved it as a food additive now they grow these in giant viral tanks off of uh meat and
[3:39:28.400 --> 3:39:34.400]  in that those products is the regular viruses in bacteria that were associated with it and the
[3:39:34.400 --> 3:39:39.200]  mutations occur so they're not just spraying these viruses now they said well you naturally have
[3:39:39.200 --> 3:39:45.840]  these viruses in your guts but this is depending on which mixture over a thousand in some cases over
[3:39:45.840 --> 3:39:53.920]  10 000 times more of these viruses than naturally occur in your gut it's kind of like uh uh
[3:39:55.600 --> 3:40:02.320]  monsanto has a form of corn that bugs won't eat because it has a naturally occurring fungus
[3:40:02.880 --> 3:40:09.440]  that grows that that that will kill bugs but it's over a thousand times again stronger than the
[3:40:09.440 --> 3:40:14.800]  regular fungus and it grows inside the corn and then you eat it that's one big reason a lot of
[3:40:14.800 --> 3:40:20.000]  honey bees are dying uh german universities have done the studies and found they have the uh the
[3:40:20.720 --> 3:40:26.160]  genetically modified corn that has this natural pesticide in it in their tiny digestive tracks
[3:40:26.160 --> 3:40:31.040]  because unlike other animals bees will still get the pollen then they go die and that's why they
[3:40:31.040 --> 3:40:35.120]  have the growth maps of where this is being grown in the u.s and europe where the bees are dying in
[3:40:35.120 --> 3:40:40.640]  some cases more than 80 percent on average we've lost half our bees in the u.s half in europe so
[3:40:40.640 --> 3:40:47.120]  so that's going on so agency approves first use of viruses as food additive uh in case you don't
[3:40:47.120 --> 3:40:52.800]  believe that because i tell people this is going on they don't believe it viral meat spray advancing
[3:40:52.800 --> 3:40:59.280]  food safety abc news says the food aisles don't seem very safe these days there are still no
[3:40:59.280 --> 3:41:05.520]  firm answers as to what caused the coli breakout well see this allows them now when chicken and
[3:41:05.520 --> 3:41:11.040]  beef and poultry and and and pork has feces on it from the cows and pigs they slaughter
[3:41:11.040 --> 3:41:15.600]  and bacteria growing they spray it down with bleach and and and try to clean it instead they
[3:41:15.600 --> 3:41:20.080]  just leave it dirty and spray the viruses on it so it allows them to feed you dirty contaminated
[3:41:20.080 --> 3:41:26.800]  meat the problem is most food poisoning is caused by the excrement the secretia the secretions of
[3:41:26.800 --> 3:41:33.360]  the bacteria their their their defecation is toxic and that's the main toxin that gets you sick
[3:41:33.360 --> 3:41:40.560]  so see they just try to clean off the feces the bacteria feces and the animals own feces and blood
[3:41:40.560 --> 3:41:45.120]  from when they get hit in the head with a gas powered hammer and blood spraying out everywhere
[3:41:45.120 --> 3:41:49.360]  and they come in with giant razor blade cutters and slit its throat sort of hacking big old pieces
[3:41:49.360 --> 3:41:54.080]  off and it's rolling around and feces everywhere and they're just slobbing that through and they
[3:41:54.080 --> 3:41:59.440]  take it in with big basters and just spray viruses all over it bread and big old giant tanks
[3:41:59.440 --> 3:42:07.840]  and they're feeding cows worldwide rotten ground up dead animals from the vet that's come out in
[3:42:07.840 --> 3:42:12.160]  mainstream news they take your dead animals grind them up and awful with dead cows and sheep and
[3:42:12.160 --> 3:42:17.040]  everything else and feed rotten meat to cows when they're not even meant to eat meat prion
[3:42:17.040 --> 3:42:23.120]  crystals then grow and and and get into the meat you then eat it they go to your brain start growing
[3:42:23.120 --> 3:42:28.960]  because they're meant to grow in dead flesh now they got 25 year olds getting Alzheimer's from it
[3:42:28.960 --> 3:42:34.000]  that's really mad cow in america this is the what you're feeding your family and this is eugenics
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:38.960]  the globalists stated they were going to develop soft kill weapons so they can give you something
[3:42:38.960 --> 3:42:44.000]  that makes you sick debilitates you and kills you in 10 15 20 years and then the doctors aren't
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:49.680]  told how to diagnose it how to diagnose it and they don't know what's happening folks there's
[3:42:49.680 --> 3:42:54.720]  thousands of these issues i could go over and i've interviewed top scientists many of them making
[3:42:54.720 --> 3:42:59.760]  two three four million dollars a year holding patents they would feed in one case in england
[3:42:59.760 --> 3:43:07.280]  in the early 90s uh gmo potatoes to rats they would become sterilized they would have their
[3:43:07.280 --> 3:43:14.320]  life expectancy cut in half uh they would have mutations after birth which is very rare uh i
[3:43:14.320 --> 3:43:20.720]  mean literally like a horror movie and then the scientists would go and say we can't put this
[3:43:20.720 --> 3:43:26.160]  on the market it's sterilizing and they they were told shut up shut up we're putting it on the market
[3:43:26.160 --> 3:43:32.240]  they know it's sterilizing you and all these ceo's and all these bankers most of them aren't in on the
[3:43:32.240 --> 3:43:39.040]  larger program they're eating it too this is hurting all of us if you're a bureaucrat if you're an
[3:43:39.040 --> 3:43:44.000]  fbi agent if you're a cop if you're a cps worker you're an enforcer for this system did you get the
[3:43:44.000 --> 3:43:50.640]  memo not to drink the 150 plus chemicals on average in some cases over 300 they put from
[3:43:53.120 --> 3:43:58.240]  fertilizer manufacturing and aluminum manufacturing aluminum production purification
[3:43:58.240 --> 3:44:05.200]  they take that toxic waste mercury lead arsenic hundreds of other chemicals sodium fluoride
[3:44:06.160 --> 3:44:12.240]  all these different acid complexes of fluoride and they dump it in your water it attacks your
[3:44:12.240 --> 3:44:18.480]  brain your glands calcifies in your bones a tax fertility oh look spider goats start work on wonder
[3:44:18.480 --> 3:44:24.160]  web uh what is that out of is that out of the uh looks like the london telegraph yeah it is
[3:44:24.160 --> 3:44:28.160]  telegraph i recognize all the papers that's the london telegraph see spider goats folks
[3:44:28.160 --> 3:44:34.720]  we're in buck rogers but it's a nightmare system we're being slowly killed slowly exterminated
[3:44:34.720 --> 3:44:40.000]  and the you know the people in pizza chains are told by their distributor hey we've got some low price
[3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:44.000]  irradiated stuff here for you and they just put it on the shelves they ship it to your
[3:44:44.000 --> 3:44:49.120]  to your house they deliver it to you to where you can't even get a packet of pepper now that
[3:44:49.120 --> 3:44:53.920]  hasn't been irradiated losing its food value and that's bare minimum what does irradiation do
[3:44:53.920 --> 3:45:00.320]  according to marcolla.com a very trusted medical doctor source because it increases the shelf life
[3:45:00.320 --> 3:45:06.400]  of the food it is used in large centralized facilities irradiation encourages globalization
[3:45:06.400 --> 3:45:10.960]  and consolidation of food production distribution and retailing industries and allows you to be fed
[3:45:10.960 --> 3:45:16.320]  food that isn't as fresh research dating the 1950s has revealed a wide range of problems with animals
[3:45:16.320 --> 3:45:21.360]  that irradiated food including premature death in a rare form of cancer reproductive dysfunction
[3:45:21.360 --> 3:45:27.600]  chromosomal abnormal abnormalities liver damage low weight gain and vitamin deficiencies and then
[3:45:27.600 --> 3:45:33.760]  they have all this sourced a full medical source from the government's own document showing the
[3:45:33.760 --> 3:45:39.200]  sourcing on that irradiation destroys vitamins essential fatty acids and other nutrients and
[3:45:39.200 --> 3:45:44.480]  foods sometimes significantly and it just goes on and on the process destroys 80 percent of vitamin
[3:45:44.480 --> 3:45:49.040]  a and eggs but the FDA nonetheless legalize irradiation these products goes on there's all
[3:45:49.040 --> 3:45:56.320]  the sources absolute fact so again i'm only giving you a very tiny fraction of this let's now play
[3:45:56.320 --> 3:46:04.480]  a clip from ms nbc hardball with their cnbc co-host coming on the info girl the info babe
[3:46:04.480 --> 3:46:10.400]  telling you hey what's wrong with lead in toys here it is coming people should be careful what
[3:46:10.400 --> 3:46:15.200]  they wish for on china you know china were to revalue its currency or china is to start making
[3:46:15.200 --> 3:46:19.440]  say toys that don't have lead in them or food that isn't poisonous get a little closer to the camera
[3:46:20.640 --> 3:46:24.960]  my what is it coming closer now coming coming coming coming closer their production are going
[3:46:24.960 --> 3:46:29.440]  to go up and that means prices at walmart here in the united states are going to go up closer to
[3:46:29.440 --> 3:46:34.240]  the camera yeah the particular clip they found i appreciate it that's not the right clip that's
[3:46:34.240 --> 3:46:40.800]  some joke clip uh i know we wrote an article at prisonplanet.com that is matthew's and and he did
[3:46:40.800 --> 3:46:45.040]  say come in closer and then she goes on to say we've got to go ahead and have the poison toys
[3:46:45.040 --> 3:46:49.440]  but then they as a joke put that clip back in let's do another search on that or ask watson i
[3:46:49.440 --> 3:46:56.080]  want the original unedited clip for people okay here's a here's another clip uh this is cbs news
[3:46:56.080 --> 3:47:01.840]  in austin but this went out nationwide what they call a news package the news is satelliteed to them
[3:47:01.840 --> 3:47:07.440]  with a script the local news readers read it but this went out nationwide on all cbs tv channels
[3:47:07.440 --> 3:47:14.160]  telling you that a government study tells you that mercury is good for your brain when it's the most
[3:47:14.160 --> 3:47:19.680]  deadly heavy metal attacking brain cells here it is here's tonight's medical headlines let medical
[3:47:19.680 --> 3:47:27.760]  watch reporters see the matter mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two
[3:47:27.760 --> 3:47:32.560]  new studies in the journal pediatrics there have been widespread concerns that mercury based
[3:47:32.560 --> 3:47:37.200]  preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological development of children these
[3:47:37.200 --> 3:47:41.600]  new studies suggest that the offices that the preservatives may actually be associated with
[3:47:41.600 --> 3:47:49.760]  improved behavior and mental performance okay now here is fox news telling you how great it is
[3:47:49.760 --> 3:47:54.640]  that that japan is looking at lithium in the water and again this is already all going on
[3:47:55.200 --> 3:47:59.840]  you're now being told how great it is because the alternative media is exposing it so they're
[3:47:59.840 --> 3:48:03.520]  saying yeah we're doing weather modification yeah we're setting up a world government yeah we're
[3:48:03.520 --> 3:48:08.000]  putting stuff in your water you're now being yeah we're listening to your cell phones by law
[3:48:08.000 --> 3:48:12.080]  with a system that can track you and listen to you even when the phone's turned off yeah there's
[3:48:12.080 --> 3:48:18.320]  oh yeah it's all happening here it is see 32 now with only two weeks left of 2009 we're taking
[3:48:18.320 --> 3:48:23.040]  a look back at some of the most interesting healthcare discoveries of the past year joining
[3:48:23.040 --> 3:48:28.160]  us is fox nine medical expert dr r kell georgia to talk about it good morning good morning
[3:48:28.160 --> 3:48:34.000]  our first use has been adding a fluoride to its public water supply for decades and of course to
[3:48:34.000 --> 3:48:39.680]  prevent tooth decay well now researchers from japan hit pause suggesting that we add lithium hit
[3:48:39.680 --> 3:48:45.280]  pause back it up a few seconds notice that she says that we put fluoride in and we put stuff
[3:48:45.280 --> 3:48:52.880]  in table salt and lithium you're being sold on this i mean this is imagine 50 years ago a science
[3:48:52.880 --> 3:48:57.680]  fiction movie where they're putting stuff in your water and food well they did write a science
[3:48:57.680 --> 3:49:03.040]  fiction book 1932 brave new world where they do drug you and oldest huxley who wrote it his
[3:49:03.040 --> 3:49:08.720]  brother was a head eugenicist he gave a 1962 speech at berkeley saying this is actually our plan we
[3:49:08.720 --> 3:49:16.320]  are doing this my book is nonfiction finish the clip to vent to decay well now researchers from
[3:49:16.320 --> 3:49:23.120]  japan are suggesting that we add lithium so why is that well they're actually not suggesting it
[3:49:23.120 --> 3:49:27.680]  but they're certainly looking into it lithium is a medication that in prescription doses
[3:49:27.680 --> 3:49:32.320]  treats mood disorders and people with bipolar disorder or manic depressive illness and what
[3:49:32.320 --> 3:49:38.800]  these researchers found in japan is that it's lithium is present in trace amounts in the normal
[3:49:38.800 --> 3:49:44.160]  water supply in some communities and in those communities they have a lower suicide rate
[3:49:44.160 --> 3:49:48.400]  and so they're really investigating whether trace amounts of lithium and they have lower
[3:49:48.400 --> 3:49:53.200]  sex drive and are obese and have brain damage enough to really in a in a positive way without
[3:49:53.200 --> 3:49:56.960]  having the bad effect oh a positive way really affect the mood and decrease the suicide rate
[3:49:56.960 --> 3:50:02.160]  very interesting concept you know it's the same reason why we put iodine and salt fluoride
[3:50:02.160 --> 3:50:07.920]  in water there's there's many different examples all right so there you are it goes on and on how
[3:50:07.920 --> 3:50:13.680]  great it is and how wonderful it is and how we need it and we did find the unedited clip on
[3:50:13.680 --> 3:50:21.200]  youtube of the of the msnbc host so cnbc host on msnbc with chris mathews and he's sitting there
[3:50:21.200 --> 3:50:26.080]  and she's talking about how great it is to do this you're being sold that poison is good you're
[3:50:26.080 --> 3:50:31.120]  being told mercury is good for you you're being told irradiation is good for you you're being told
[3:50:31.120 --> 3:50:37.440]  gmo crops is is good for you as all these new diseases pop up as all this illness takes place

[3:50:42.000 --> 3:50:47.520]  in medical care the average doctor has no idea this is happening we are all living in a nightmare

[3:54:02.720 --> 3:54:14.160]  in think about it think about it long and hard if the founding fathers discovered that the government
[3:54:14.160 --> 3:54:19.920]  was putting toxins in the water to brain damage them and make them more docile and pliable would
[3:54:19.920 --> 3:54:26.880]  they get angry would your grandfather or your great grandfather get violently angry if they were
[3:54:26.880 --> 3:54:32.800]  radiating food that destroys the food value and feeding it to his kids or grandkids would they
[3:54:32.800 --> 3:54:38.160]  get angry if hundreds of chemicals are being put in their water would they be angry if viruses
[3:54:38.160 --> 3:54:44.000]  were being sprayed on their meat yes the reason you're not angry and the reason you're not like
[3:54:44.000 --> 3:54:50.720]  your grandparents or their parents is because for at least 60 years toxic chemicals have been put in
[3:54:50.720 --> 3:54:56.400]  your food and water i have times of london articles with the british and australian government
[3:54:56.400 --> 3:55:05.920]  would ship rice with toxic sedatives on them and sterilants to asia this has been going on forever
[3:55:05.920 --> 3:55:12.080]  you have a scientific dictatorship that does whatever it wants whenever it wants to you
[3:55:12.960 --> 3:55:17.440]  the denial is over and because we've been exposing them they know you're docile they know you're
[3:55:17.440 --> 3:55:22.560]  partially drugged you can still fight through it get yourself cleaned up then you'll feel
[3:55:22.560 --> 3:55:27.280]  that you're normal anger come back that anger is to motivate you to get yourself out of a bad
[3:55:27.280 --> 3:55:33.360]  situation and so now they're going that's right lithium that's right prozac in the water statins
[3:55:33.360 --> 3:55:37.280]  in the water that's right we're radiating your food that's right we're spraying viruses on it
[3:55:37.280 --> 3:55:41.760]  that's right we're feeding you gmo crops that sterilize everything that's fed it that's right
[3:55:42.560 --> 3:55:49.280]  that's right mercury's good for your baby and i i'm running out of time but if you search
[3:55:49.280 --> 3:55:54.320]  engines the term fda says melamine not harmful then you read the article in fact do that real
[3:55:54.320 --> 3:55:59.280]  fast fda says melamine not harmful remember a couple years ago all the chinese plastic and
[3:55:59.280 --> 3:56:03.680]  food was killing people and making them sick so the fda just came out and said we're just
[3:56:03.680 --> 3:56:10.000]  going to say it's not bad for you what will they say next jumping off a 500 foot cliff and
[3:56:10.000 --> 3:56:21.280]  it mad for you they think you're stupid are you i meant to get into health care uh senate health

[3:58:47.120 --> 3:58:52.160]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[3:58:52.160 --> 3:58:57.440]  your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[3:58:57.440 --> 3:59:02.320]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
