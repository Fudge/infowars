[00:00.000 --> 00:15.240]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:15.240 --> 00:22.680]  Remember two years ago, the current Congresswoman from Tennessee, one of the Congresswomen from
[00:22.680 --> 00:29.800]  Tennessee, simply ran her own campaign ad on her own Twitter account and the video was banned.
[00:29.800 --> 00:34.880]  And they had congressional hearings. That was a really big deal. Well, now there's a state senator
[00:34.880 --> 00:43.800]  who's in the front running for governor in the state where he's running in Georgia and he has
[00:43.800 --> 00:50.360]  sent us a letter. He's happy to come on. I don't want to get him on the next few days. From Facebook,
[00:50.360 --> 00:56.360]  we've also gotten this from other Republican Party candidates saying you are not allowed to
[00:56.360 --> 01:03.680]  advertise with Alex Jones or ImphalWars. Now let's be clear. We're not getting any money. Facebook
[01:03.680 --> 01:12.680]  lets them advertise on the page that our people go to and lets them directly message them. Now
[01:12.680 --> 01:16.240]  the Democrats brag that they basically control Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. So they're all
[01:16.240 --> 01:23.920]  allowed to operate. But this is clear election racketeering. Trying to keep conservative
[01:23.920 --> 01:28.000]  candidates from being able to legally and lawfully reach out and politically advertise or reach
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.720]  out to people. It's a huge deal. But here's what's more ominous. They list and culture bright
[01:34.720 --> 01:46.280]  Bart as well and say on the 24th, that's eight days away, nine days away, we will quote no longer be
[01:46.280 --> 01:51.920]  available on Facebook. I've been announcing this for two days. There's an article last night on
[01:51.920 --> 02:00.080]  ImphalWars.com. I'm going to ask our folks to retweet that at real Alex Jones. And no one even
[02:00.080 --> 02:07.680]  cares because we're so used to the censorship. And now it's hit the flashpoint. You can put a
[02:07.680 --> 02:13.840]  piece of paper on hot on top of hot stove until it hits 450 something degrees. It just browns and
[02:13.840 --> 02:19.520]  yellows, but suddenly it flashes into flame. We're in that political millisecond right now
[02:21.840 --> 02:29.040]  where the censorship is just flame on. It is massive. It is historic. It is draconian.
[02:29.040 --> 02:36.160]  And it is widespread. So we'll be talking about that. Paul Watson is going to join us as well.
[02:37.120 --> 02:40.560]  He put out a critique of the violent anti-American
[02:44.480 --> 02:49.680]  anti-white race war Childish Gambino video blurred out all the violent stuff.
[02:50.480 --> 02:54.880]  Well, the Childish Gambino video has been force fed on YouTube 120 million times to everybody.
[02:54.880 --> 03:02.480]  But Paul's video was blocked in less than six hours after being up on the grounds that it was
[03:02.480 --> 03:11.360]  violent. But he blurred out the actual simulated killings. So his critique, the most protected
[03:11.360 --> 03:16.240]  form of speech, isn't allowed. And I see the bots on ImphalWars commenting, oh, it's a private
[03:16.240 --> 03:20.240]  corporation and do whatever it wants. Really, YouTube, it has the terms of service that it
[03:20.240 --> 03:25.680]  violates with you. It's selective. It's discriminating on a mass platform. They claim to Congress,
[03:25.680 --> 03:30.240]  they never do it, that they're a utility. They could be busted up for this.
[03:32.480 --> 03:36.640]  Jack Dorsey didn't say, oh, it's our platform. We own it on Twitter. He said, we're going to
[03:36.640 --> 03:42.960]  crush conservatives. Close quote. We're going to crush you and silence you.
[03:44.320 --> 03:48.560]  And they're got the Democratic Party trying to shut down ImphalWars, trying to kick us off radio
[03:48.560 --> 03:53.680]  stations, trying to ban us from advertising. This is the opposite of free market. It's authoritarianism
[03:53.680 --> 04:01.120]  just like Venezuela. It's just how they operate in Cuba and Venezuela. And it will kill this country,
[04:01.120 --> 04:08.160]  ladies and gentlemen. So it's an amazing time to be alive and it's extremely, extremely dangerous.
[04:08.160 --> 04:12.320]  So that's all coming up. Now, that's just part of what I'm going to be covering on the historic
[04:12.320 --> 04:21.920]  draconian censorship today. YouTube allows video depiction of massacre to be watched by children,
[04:21.920 --> 04:28.320]  censors criticism of it. ImphalWars.com, NewsWars.com, polls re-uploaded it to Facebook for now.
[04:28.320 --> 04:34.880]  And we have that link in the article so you can see it. Just months ago,
[04:34.880 --> 04:39.360]  they're in Congress, saying when Alex Jones censored, the big three CEOs go, yes, sir,
[04:39.360 --> 04:44.400]  we'll get on that congressman quickly right now. Sir, we censored Paul Watson and Alex Jones at
[04:44.400 --> 04:49.200]  lunch. He goes, I know, I saw that. They were number one. I want them censored. Fake news.
[04:49.200 --> 04:53.520]  They claim that truck attack in New York was a Muslim. It was not. They go, yes, sir, it was not.
[04:53.520 --> 04:58.080]  He screamed all Akbar. It's on record. He was. These are dangerous, evil people, folks.
[05:00.480 --> 05:06.560]  Feeling your body is hard work. That's why we've introduced the InfoWars Life Daily Digestive

[06:23.440 --> 06:30.480]  InfoWars and our radio, TV, and internet platforms
[06:33.200 --> 06:38.320]  have been absolutely smashing through the global ascensors. We've been breaking every
[06:38.320 --> 06:44.400]  record, every podcast record, every video download record. We've been getting numbers only rivaled
[06:44.400 --> 06:53.200]  by hip-hop and major motion pictures. We conservatively had 86 million views and listens
[06:53.200 --> 07:00.960]  the week of the election 2016 in November. Despite all their censorship, all their crackdowns,
[07:00.960 --> 07:06.800]  we're exploding on talk radio and on television. But on the internet, they have crushed us down
[07:06.800 --> 07:18.560]  to 20, 30 million views a week. But they've said that for the 2018 election, they are going to
[07:18.560 --> 07:26.080]  basically end all conservative libertarian Christian nationalist media. And it's been
[07:26.080 --> 07:30.320]  announced, it's been caught on hidden camera by Project Veritas, but now they're having congressional
[07:30.320 --> 07:36.960]  hearings, it's happening. And Facebook has announced that as of the 24th of this month, eight, nine
[07:36.960 --> 07:44.560]  days away, Breitbart, InfoWars, and Coulter, and it lists others, will no longer be available.
[07:46.160 --> 07:52.240]  When senators and congressmen and gubernatorial candidates and state senators go and they try
[07:52.240 --> 07:58.640]  to buy, not advertising with us, they try to go, showing what Facebook does, and by being able to
[07:58.640 --> 08:09.600]  place ads to InfoWars supporters, we don't even make any money. Zuckerberg does. They're saying
[08:09.600 --> 08:16.560]  those sites will no longer be available. Now, what does that tell you? It tells you they're either
[08:16.560 --> 08:23.440]  going to totally shadow man us on Facebook on the 24th or something even more draconian,
[08:23.440 --> 08:30.240]  because if they're telling people, hey, sorry, you can spend money contacting these people until
[08:30.240 --> 08:35.200]  the 24th, and then they will no longer be available. The documents, the screenshots,
[08:35.200 --> 08:40.160]  they're all on InfoWars.com. I'm going to have it retweeted out at Real Alex Jones, Facebook,
[08:40.160 --> 08:48.000]  preparing to ban conservatives before midterm election, social media giant ramping up
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.000]  InfoWars censorship to gain control of the narrative. This is massive violation of the First Amendment,
[08:54.000 --> 08:59.600]  massive political racketeering, incredible fraud. You think Hillary rigging the debates and getting
[08:59.600 --> 09:04.880]  the questions beforehand, and, you know, all the fake polls was bad. This is next level.
[09:04.880 --> 09:11.840]  When GOP Governor candidate is in the store at InfoWars.com, tried to reach out to our listeners
[09:11.840 --> 09:17.760]  and send them a video of him and his deportation bus that he's got as a stunt. He's current
[09:17.760 --> 09:21.360]  State Senator Michael Williams. They were told, we've got this letter right here,
[09:21.360 --> 09:30.000]  you are not allowed to advertise on this list of groups. And it lists them all right here.
[09:31.120 --> 09:35.840]  Ben Carson and Coulter, Andrew Breitbart still has his personal page on there.
[09:36.400 --> 09:43.200]  Bill O'Reilly, Alex Jones. That's just one guy. I've got all the letters pouring in
[09:43.200 --> 09:48.000]  from Republicans and Libertarians and everybody else. And they're like, yeah, they're telling us
[09:49.200 --> 09:54.560]  we're not able to contact your people. Because the media spun it like, oh, if Republicans contact
[09:54.560 --> 09:59.520]  people on Facebook through Facebook and Facebook makes money, that's dirty and bad. The Democrats
[09:59.520 --> 10:06.240]  do it 10 to 1. They brag. It's, it's, they brag. We own Facebook. They force feed it. Democrats don't
[10:06.240 --> 10:16.400]  even have to pay. But now they're telling Republicans your money is not accepted here. Get out of our
[10:16.400 --> 10:20.560]  business. We're not baking your cake. We're not cutting your hair. We're not selling you a shirt.
[10:20.560 --> 10:24.480]  We're not feeding you food at the lunch counter. You don't get to sit at the back of the bus.
[10:24.480 --> 10:30.640]  You get your Republican butt off that bus. We don't care if you're black. We don't care if you're
[10:30.640 --> 10:36.800]  white. If you're a nationalist, a free market person, a conservative, get your butt off this bus
[10:36.800 --> 10:42.400]  now. Now I love how even the Hill who'd make fun of me a year ago saying the censorship was here,
[10:42.400 --> 10:46.880]  now they got headlines. Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, admit censoring conservatives.
[10:46.880 --> 10:52.080]  This is massive and it's not their own companies. They advertise. Come here. Be part of it. Follow
[10:52.080 --> 10:56.320]  the rules. You send everybody the traffic. It becomes the internet and then they cut you off.
[10:56.320 --> 11:01.600]  And then lie about you and call you racist or extremist while they do it.
[11:03.440 --> 11:09.200]  Coming up the bottom of the hour, Paul Joseph Watson put out a viral video exposing the race war
[11:09.200 --> 11:15.040]  anti-white narrative of the Childish Gambino as the answer to the love and what was being put out
[11:15.040 --> 11:20.160]  by Kanye West. He didn't show any of the violence, any of what they showed in the video that's not
[11:20.160 --> 11:24.960]  being censored. That's got 120 million views by Childish Gambino. But polls was censored
[11:24.960 --> 11:32.080]  for quote, showing violence and blocked. We're again re-uploading it to a few other places right
[11:32.080 --> 11:36.160]  now. I'm sure they'll try to knock it down as well, but this is where they're trying to kill discourse.
[11:36.160 --> 11:40.960]  Now I'm done talking about the censorship for now. Paul's coming up, but this is bigger than Alex Jones.
[11:40.960 --> 11:45.520]  It's bigger than Breitbart. It's bigger than Drudge Report. It's bigger than America. We have
[11:45.520 --> 11:50.240]  censorship in China emanating out. We have Apple moving over there. We have massive censorship
[11:50.240 --> 11:55.360]  intensifying across the world. We have church bells aren't allowed to ring in Germany and Sweden.
[11:58.080 --> 12:03.920]  That's in mainstream news, but the Muslims can blast their call to prayer at full power
[12:04.640 --> 12:09.440]  all over. They're passing Sharia law in Europe. I mean, this is crazy.
[12:11.520 --> 12:17.200]  Swedish city allows 110 DB Muslim prayer calls, rejects church clock ringing.
[12:17.200 --> 12:26.240]  That's a Europe Wars.com article right now, linking to mainstream news. And the only mainstream news
[12:26.240 --> 12:28.480]  covering it's the Russians because they're pro-Christian now.
[12:31.440 --> 12:37.440]  The Irish times did it too. Now let's get into this. Wait till you hear this speaking of the Irish.
[12:37.440 --> 12:42.080]  Just to give you a picture of how this ties together. Irish pressured to house migrants
[12:42.080 --> 12:47.920]  North African and Islamic invaders in spare bedrooms, vacation homes just like Italy,
[12:47.920 --> 12:51.440]  where they throw all the people out of a little hotel on the seaside and say,
[12:51.440 --> 12:54.800]  we're not paying you now. And the federal police put
[12:57.120 --> 13:01.440]  the North Africans into their homes. This is a planned takeover. They want to advertise,
[13:01.440 --> 13:03.600]  come to Europe. Everything's free. That's on
[13:03.600 --> 13:11.760]  Europe Wars.com as well. Our new Europe Bureau, that's a Dan Lyman story,
[13:11.760 --> 13:15.440]  linking to mainstream European news announcing it. And that ties into this.
[13:16.800 --> 13:24.320]  No whites allowed day continues at Evergreen College despite last year's uproar.
[13:24.320 --> 13:28.080]  That's right. No whites are going to be allowed this Saturday at the school.
[13:28.080 --> 13:33.120]  Any professors that complain will be fired. The only whites allowed are the white communist
[13:33.120 --> 13:40.080]  controlling the whole operation. Oh, by the way, four socialist one primaries.
[13:41.840 --> 13:45.360]  It doesn't matter because they're women, so it's okay in Pennsylvania.
[13:47.200 --> 13:51.920]  That's right. Look at Venezuela collapsing. Look at every other socialist country collapsing.
[13:51.920 --> 13:58.720]  They don't care. Hip hip hooray. But these are all leftovers from the whole Bernie movement.
[13:58.720 --> 14:04.640]  So four socialist back candidates when Pennsylvania legislative primaries
[14:04.640 --> 14:09.200]  show you where the Democrats are and they're running on a total socialist platform.
[14:09.840 --> 14:14.160]  But that's okay because they're women, so don't criticize them for their horrible views.
[14:15.040 --> 14:19.280]  Well, I guess the dictator of Venezuela at least is a guy, so I can criticize him and
[14:19.280 --> 14:24.160]  people starving and a thousand dying a week starvation. That's okay.
[14:24.160 --> 14:31.440]  Hey, crisis pours into Columbia across border bridge. That's out of the Bakersfield newspaper.
[14:32.160 --> 14:36.320]  And then now from South America, collapsing Central America and Mexico is collapsing
[14:36.880 --> 14:42.640]  as millions migrate and flee collapsing communist and socialist countries. But that's okay.
[14:43.440 --> 14:45.200]  We can make it just like that here.
[14:48.560 --> 14:53.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting. We're having victories for capitalism and free speech.
[14:53.440 --> 14:56.560]  But we, America and a few other nations of the last stand here.
[14:57.680 --> 15:00.800]  And that's why it's more important than ever. Please spread the word about the live broadcast on

[15:10.480 --> 15:15.040]  And we're adding more of those features soon and working on that. We're making our exodus away,
[15:15.040 --> 15:19.280]  but we're still fighting to try to keep some freedom on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter because
[15:19.280 --> 15:26.640]  they've said when they're done shutting us down on the wider web, Google's 90% of web searches,
[15:27.360 --> 15:32.240]  YouTube's 70% of any of you, when they're done, they're coming to shut us down right here. Hell,
[15:32.240 --> 15:36.880]  Soros and Hillary and their lawyers are suing us right now saying they want us shut down.
[15:36.880 --> 15:40.880]  So we're fighting on every battlefield and every front we can place our feet on.

[18:56.720 --> 19:02.320]  favorite coffee. Available at infowarslife.com. Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough
[19:02.320 --> 19:07.680]  in modern medicine. Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new,
[19:07.680 --> 19:12.880]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal
[19:12.880 --> 19:20.320]  and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function. In the 1960s, researchers in France
[19:20.320 --> 19:25.680]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[19:25.680 --> 19:31.280]  responses. They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have
[19:31.280 --> 19:36.400]  the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal
[19:36.400 --> 19:42.560]  distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact,
[19:42.560 --> 19:47.040]  current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[19:47.040 --> 19:52.880]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body. Go outside
[19:52.880 --> 19:59.040]  and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable
[19:59.040 --> 20:05.920]  tablets. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:05.920 --> 20:18.960]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[20:18.960 --> 20:41.280]  So, why does George Soros, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party, the EU, the Vatican,
[20:42.480 --> 20:46.320]  and every other major globalist organization, Hollywood, the Communist Chinese,
[20:46.320 --> 20:53.040]  why do they all single Alex Jones out, info wars out, and Paul Joseph Watson out,
[20:53.040 --> 20:57.920]  and say that we are to be shut down and that we are scum and that we are evil and that we are
[20:57.920 --> 21:04.080]  bad people? Well, none of it's true. Because we have built a platform
[21:05.760 --> 21:08.960]  that reaches millions of people a day, but that's not what threatens them.
[21:09.760 --> 21:12.800]  The military, the police, and foreign governments listen.
[21:12.800 --> 21:18.800]  The intelligentsia listen because they know this is one of the only places you can tune in
[21:18.800 --> 21:24.400]  and actually hear real info that they already know. They already know we're telling the truth
[21:24.400 --> 21:34.400]  because they know more than we do in many cases. We told you five years ago that Hillary and Obama,
[21:34.400 --> 21:43.120]  stage Benghazi, to ship three warehouses of high-impact anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to al-Qaeda.
[21:43.680 --> 21:46.880]  When that got exposed, we exposed it first before anybody.
[21:48.240 --> 21:51.440]  Then Colonel Shaffer and others were able to expose it with even more intel.
[21:52.640 --> 21:57.600]  We got massively attacked for that. What do they list of the internal Google documents that have
[21:57.600 --> 22:02.560]  been leaked while they want to shut us down? Because we exposed that. We've gotten more footage
[22:02.560 --> 22:07.920]  of the Palestinians laying on the ground, pretending like they've been shot at a mass
[22:07.920 --> 22:11.200]  funeral with sheets over them, and then they take the sheets off and they get back up. I'm
[22:11.200 --> 22:16.160]  going to show that coming up. We take stuff that they don't want out and we put it out.
[22:16.960 --> 22:20.960]  Does that mean I'm glad Palestinians have been shot? No, I'm not against the Palestinians,
[22:20.960 --> 22:26.160]  but most of the time it's fake. And that's what I'm tired of. And we have the proof.
[22:26.160 --> 22:28.880]  Like they now admit the last chemical attack didn't even happen.
[22:28.880 --> 22:33.280]  Trump's cut the funding for the White Helmets. We've been totally proven right about that.
[22:34.080 --> 22:40.240]  That's why I got so mad when Trump bombed the base there over the lie. It's not true.
[22:40.240 --> 22:44.080]  But at least Trump now knows he got lied to. But let me give you the big news.
[22:45.920 --> 22:47.840]  I'm on the elliptical this morning at eight o'clock.
[22:49.520 --> 22:56.240]  Fox News. Dun dun dun. Top story. We've interviewed the man who turned the weapons over
[22:56.240 --> 23:00.400]  that he hadn't finished selling to Al Qaeda, but says he sold plane load after plane load
[23:00.400 --> 23:05.520]  that landed and he would give it right to Al Qaeda under U.S. orders.
[23:08.640 --> 23:13.040]  Oh, and guess where a lot of the weapons came through? Out of Mexico. We had Tosh Plumley,
[23:14.160 --> 23:20.560]  who led squadrons of aircraft before he retired five years ago,
[23:20.560 --> 23:28.800]  into Syria and into Iraq, landing, and the Wahhabis would come up to the plane. Yes,
[23:28.800 --> 23:35.440]  Tosh himself was flying some of these for the CIA. Tosh has to live in a secret location
[23:35.440 --> 23:46.080]  in South America now. Oh, 2013 info wars dot com. Former CIA pilot Plumley says,
[23:46.080 --> 23:52.400]  and it goes through it all. Flashback. Hillary Clinton facilitated legal sales of arms to Al Qaeda.
[23:52.960 --> 23:55.840]  2016. That one was 2013.
[23:57.920 --> 24:03.920]  Trump is right. Here's the proof. Hillary and Obama founded ISIS info wars dot com. Kit Daniels.
[24:03.920 --> 24:09.200]  But those are all two years ago. Guys, search engine Tosh Plumley info wars dot com. Show them
[24:09.200 --> 24:17.680]  the 2013 2014 2015. The video is the article then that's the really powerful ones word for word.
[24:18.800 --> 24:27.360]  What is now Fox News? There it is 2013. November 1st. Former CIA pilot. He was, by the way,
[24:27.360 --> 24:32.320]  still a pilot at that time says Reagan administration responsible for death of DEA agent.
[24:32.320 --> 24:36.320]  And you read deeper into the article is that's not the one. It's another one that came out right
[24:36.320 --> 24:41.120]  after that. You know what happens? I get on the fly. All the listeners know we exposed this.
[24:41.120 --> 24:45.520]  They know Tosh Plumley was on 15 times. They all know we exposed it. And then they're just in
[24:45.520 --> 24:49.840]  their randomly search engine and other times he came on. Here it is. Former CIA whistleblower
[24:49.840 --> 24:57.440]  targeted by government over Facebook post October 7th 2013. Julie Wilson. And then it goes into
[24:57.440 --> 25:03.440]  the whole thing about Benghazi and all the rest of it. Yeah, the thing to search is CIA whistleblower
[25:03.440 --> 25:12.320]  Tosh Plumley. Obama administration and Hillary Clinton shipped arms to Al Qaeda in Syria.
[25:12.320 --> 25:16.720]  That is the headline. You guys are just getting the Tosh Plumley search. You're getting some
[25:16.720 --> 25:23.280]  sub stuff. And there it all is. Gun runner CIA gun runner. Hillary's Benghazi crimes confirmed
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.120]  2015. Major whistleblower breaks down the current state of the country. And there's the whole
[25:29.120 --> 25:34.000]  article and the whole video. There's a bunch of other ones exposing the entire thing, how it was
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.480]  done, how they shipped the weapons in, how they changed the name to ISIS to confuse people,
[25:38.480 --> 25:43.920]  how they were starting a Middle Eastern war, how she used the State Department export rule to
[25:44.560 --> 25:49.280]  block the ban, how they shipped in the weapons, what the NATO troops told him, what the special
[25:49.280 --> 25:53.280]  operations troops told him, what the other pilots told him and what he saw with his own eyeballs.
[25:53.280 --> 26:00.240]  And they death-threaded him and everything else. So you now want to know why they hate us? Because
[26:00.240 --> 26:08.000]  in 2018, dun dun dun, Bill Himmer and the rest of the Fox News staff will tell you everything and
[26:08.000 --> 26:16.080]  give us no credit. Colonel Shaffer went on in 2014 and 15 and said this stuff on Fox. But he said
[26:16.080 --> 26:23.360]  it on Fox Business on Lou Dobbs. Oh, they let him say it, but only on Fox Business. They have him
[26:23.360 --> 26:29.200]  on regular Fox, but not to cover this stuff. You know, he works for Fox. And boy, does he get in
[26:29.200 --> 26:34.720]  trouble when he comes on here. So that's the reality, ladies and gentlemen. You got the information
[26:34.720 --> 26:41.280]  here for years before you got anywhere else. Why are we under attack? Why are we being censored?
[26:41.280 --> 26:46.240]  Why are we being demonized? Why are we being sued? Why are we being lied about? Because we care about
[26:46.240 --> 26:50.560]  America and we're not rolling over to George Soros. And by the way, people always say, oh, Alex,
[26:51.920 --> 26:58.480]  you know, you sit there and, you know, you, you act like George Soros is so powerful. Folks,
[26:58.480 --> 27:06.400]  every time I turn around, it's George Soros. You know, George Soros just bought control of Tesla.
[27:06.400 --> 27:12.480]  He'll have control of SpaceX next. And you know how he did it? They had the media badmouth Tesla
[27:12.480 --> 27:20.720]  and badmouth SpaceX and drive down the stocks, billions and billions of dollars. And now Soros,
[27:22.080 --> 27:29.360]  the little doodoo bird, can come flapping in with only 35 million and leverage it and take control
[27:29.360 --> 27:36.640]  of the company. And then they spend it like, oh, he's buddy, Elon Musk. That's how you do it.
[27:36.640 --> 27:42.320]  He's involved in everything. You turn over any rock and that guy is waiting underneath it. Now,
[27:42.320 --> 27:46.960]  that said, Paul Joseph Watson is joining us on the massive censorship. And I'm going to put out
[27:46.960 --> 27:51.280]  a video later, a special report with the Tosh Plumley clubs, with everything that was shed,
[27:51.280 --> 27:59.520]  and then compare it to the Fox News report. How Hillary and Obama gave the orders to ship the
[27:59.520 --> 28:09.120]  heavy weapons to Al Qaeda. I gave the US trucks and ammunition to Al Qaeda. US equipment weapons
[28:09.120 --> 28:15.920]  handed over to Al Qaeda. And then it goes through the whole thing and how it happened. Oh my gosh.
[28:15.920 --> 28:22.480]  And this itself is a whitewash. So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, the news from four years
[28:22.480 --> 28:31.440]  from now today, infowars.com, newswars.com, europewars.com, prisonplanet.com. That's why
[28:31.440 --> 28:35.680]  they hate us. That's why they're after us because we're on target and we'll tell the truth. And oh,
[28:35.680 --> 28:40.720]  and I'll say it again and again, George Soros said on 60 Minutes, he was a Nazi collaborator and he
[28:40.720 --> 28:45.520]  was proud of it and he'd do it again. And that's why they got his PR firms out saying he never
[28:45.520 --> 28:50.240]  did such a thing. And I'm a liar. And in all these lawsuits, they just list George Soros and that
[28:50.240 --> 28:55.440]  randomly as a message to me to shut up. No, you're a Nazi collaborator. You're a mass criminal.
[28:55.440 --> 29:17.360]  You overthrow countries. You're the enemy, George Soros. You're a piece of crap.
[29:25.440 --> 29:27.840]  That's blackriflerealestate.com.

[38:23.280 --> 38:31.840]  and the woods are lovely dark and deep but the truth will out now there's a number one music
[38:31.840 --> 38:37.680]  video out there and paul watson devastates it coming up when we air this in the next segment
[38:37.680 --> 38:42.800]  but i wanted him to specifically speak to this the articles up on info wars dot com we have
[38:42.800 --> 38:46.560]  reuploaded it from facebook so you can see the censored video for limited time we'll probably
[38:46.560 --> 38:52.560]  take that down youtube allows video description of massacred to be watched by children but when
[38:52.560 --> 38:58.880]  we criticize it they censor the video criticizing it that censors the violence so this is exposing
[38:58.880 --> 39:04.320]  them targeting children with this race baiting race war violent garbage and blocking it for most
[39:04.320 --> 39:11.680]  audiences but not blocking the actual violence and race baiting so total hypocrisy total fraud and
[39:11.680 --> 39:16.480]  then it dovetails them with everything else paul thanks for joining us give us a update on this
[39:17.760 --> 39:22.800]  well the update is literally five minutes ago they restored it which always happens right
[39:22.800 --> 39:27.680]  we always make a big deal out of it point to the fact that this is the strisand effect they
[39:27.680 --> 39:31.600]  they're still seem completely unaware of what the strisand effect is then it ends up getting
[39:31.600 --> 39:36.400]  hundreds of thousands of more views anyway so it always fails but they keep doing it
[39:36.400 --> 39:41.120]  and we've got a platform to kind of push back most people don't most people just accept it
[39:41.120 --> 39:47.840]  the video is basically the us billboard number one hit song right now it shows it depicts in
[39:47.840 --> 39:53.600]  bloody gore and violence somebody being shot in the head a group of gospel singers being massacred
[39:53.600 --> 40:00.000]  with an ak-47 youtube didn't age restrict it no no no they promoted it on their trending page for
[40:00.000 --> 40:06.160]  the past 10 days there's no age restriction children can watch this and it's advertiser friendly
[40:06.160 --> 40:10.720]  now i don't really care alex i don't i don't support censorship in any faction but it's
[40:10.720 --> 40:17.280]  it's the double standard so i put up a video last night criticizing this video the message
[40:17.280 --> 40:22.160]  behind it because the washington post inside edition the view they put they all put their
[40:22.160 --> 40:27.440]  videos on youtube thawning over it and praising it basically it trashes america it's you know the
[40:27.440 --> 40:33.600]  usual black lives matter rhetoric america's racist evil and corrupt it allows uh donald
[40:33.600 --> 40:39.200]  glober the creator of this video to become a uh an international actor music star and be on all
[40:39.200 --> 40:43.920]  the top tv shows every night for the past two weeks because america's so evil and racist
[40:43.920 --> 40:48.560]  so i basically made some points rebutting and he's gonna be lando cal rizzi in a new movie it's
[40:48.560 --> 40:55.600]  just so horrible yeah so horrible yeah he's literally like the most adored famous person on
[40:55.600 --> 41:00.720]  earth but america's racist and uh hates black people apparently so i made a video about it
[41:00.720 --> 41:07.200]  criticizing the message behind it within hours it was put behind what they call the gulag
[41:07.200 --> 41:12.320]  which is when a video starts to go viral they immediately shut it down prevent comments prevent
[41:12.320 --> 41:16.640]  likes prevent it from being shared you have to be signed into a youtube account to watch it
[41:16.640 --> 41:23.840]  basically kills any traction the video has so understand the fact that the washington post
[41:23.840 --> 41:30.160]  and all these other outlets had had their videos on youtube for days praising the original video
[41:30.160 --> 41:37.040]  that's fine as soon as i criticize it with my opinion and don't even show the violence which
[41:37.040 --> 41:42.400]  is in the original i literally censored the violence which is not censored in the original
[41:42.400 --> 41:47.760]  which is available for children to watch and is advertiser friendly so within about 12 hours
[41:47.760 --> 41:54.880]  it got nearly 200 000 views it was shut down it was censored now obviously we've got some kind of
[41:54.880 --> 42:00.000]  resources to draw attention to this and to freak out about it so it's just been restored as of
[42:00.000 --> 42:06.400]  about 10 minutes ago but again it's goes back to the point there's this narrative alex oh the
[42:06.400 --> 42:11.200]  conservative snowflakes are complaining about being censored again what are you talking about
[42:11.200 --> 42:17.360]  you're never censored literally within hours of me making this video boom censored so yes we
[42:17.360 --> 42:21.840]  are being censored and paul let's expand on that they then argue hey it's their own corporation blah
[42:21.840 --> 42:26.800]  blah blah the left will sue you if you don't bake their cake they advertise it as youtube we follow
[42:26.800 --> 42:31.600]  the rules they break the rules they're allowed to make fun of dead bodies and stuff and not get in
[42:31.600 --> 42:36.720]  trouble we just expose what they're doing and they try to deny us from the electronic town square
[42:36.720 --> 42:42.800]  and we come back though we're gonna play the censored video that's now been put back up for now
[42:42.800 --> 42:46.560]  which they killed when it started going mega viral it's up on info wars dot com we're gonna

[47:41.840 --> 47:48.640]  central texas command center in the heart of the resistance you're listening to alex jones
[47:48.640 --> 47:58.080]  what headline did i run yesterday at infowars.com on the live feeds urgun announces global caliphate
[47:58.080 --> 48:03.680]  against israel america and the e u what is the headline that he officially said today
[48:03.680 --> 48:10.400]  drugreport.com please tomorrow's news today please put it back on screen for me urgun urges
[48:10.400 --> 48:16.240]  islamic world to unite against israel uh actually he said more than that because he said it before
[48:16.240 --> 48:22.320]  and when he pulled his people out of the israel and us embassies that signaled he's going to
[48:22.320 --> 48:29.440]  really take the mask off so there you go back to paul watson paul and we're going to play this video
[48:29.440 --> 48:33.760]  and come back with five more minutes to you to react to facebook's announcement that will be removed
[48:33.760 --> 48:38.320]  the 24th that's what it says this is just spectacular they also say breitbart will be
[48:38.960 --> 48:43.680]  and others and culture but just before we play this game bino piece in one minute other points
[48:43.680 --> 48:50.880]  yeah the other point is this video is based on the premise that the entertainment industry and
[48:50.880 --> 48:56.480]  the media distracts people from real issues what they call real issues are identity politics
[48:56.480 --> 49:02.400]  racism black lives matter rhetoric which of course is all the entertainment industry media talks about
[49:02.400 --> 49:08.400]  every award show nfl late night comedy monologues that's all they talk about so they're not
[49:08.400 --> 49:14.000]  distracting from it they're promoting it so i mean i i drew attention to this you know this the guy
[49:14.000 --> 49:20.880]  behind this video is on every major tv talk show has been for the past two weeks so the video itself
[49:20.880 --> 49:26.320]  distracts from real issues i brought up real issues in the actual video like if you really
[49:26.320 --> 49:30.800]  care about black lives shouldn't the fact that 90 percent of black people are killed by other black
[49:30.800 --> 49:34.960]  people clearly clearly paul that conversation they can't deal with the real debate they're
[49:34.960 --> 49:38.720]  force-feeding this narrative with hundreds of movies tv shows trying to cause a race war it's
[49:38.720 --> 49:43.760]  in the wiki leaks we'll be back in a moment after the censored video here it is this is crazy
[49:52.320 --> 49:57.280]  this is america why am i analyzing this is america by childish gambino because millions
[49:57.280 --> 50:02.720]  upon millions of people have blithely swallowed the social justice narrative that it promotes
[50:02.720 --> 50:08.160]  they're calling it overnight cultural phenomenon this video is basically the antidote to everything
[50:08.160 --> 50:12.800]  konye has been saying for the past few weeks now first off i'm not questioning the talents of
[50:12.800 --> 50:18.240]  either donald glover or the choreography for this video which are both obviously substantial i am
[50:18.240 --> 50:24.240]  questioning the phony race baiting divisive narrative that the video seeks to elevate so donald
[50:24.240 --> 50:31.040]  glover childish gambino is essentially playing the role of america white america to be more precise
[50:31.040 --> 50:36.160]  lover massacring the gospel singers is a reference to the racist murder of black churchgoers in
[50:36.160 --> 50:41.600]  charleston the guy shot at the beginning of the video also looks like trevor martin's dad cementing
[50:41.600 --> 50:48.640]  the black lives matter theme that racist white america is hunting down african americans strangely
[50:48.640 --> 50:54.080]  absent from the four-minute video is any reference whatsoever to the number one killer of black
[50:54.080 --> 51:00.160]  people in america which is other black people a fact you'd think would be part of the conversation
[51:00.160 --> 51:05.920]  if glover really cared about black lives also absent is the fact that black people kill more
[51:05.920 --> 51:11.120]  white people than vice versa despite the fact that white people make up a far larger percentage
[51:11.120 --> 51:18.720]  of the population according to the national crime victimization survey in 2010 62,593 blacks
[51:18.720 --> 51:25.680]  were the victims of white violence during that same year 320,082 whites were the victims of black
[51:25.680 --> 51:30.320]  violence that's five times as many violent attacks but that number is misleading since the black and
[51:30.320 --> 51:36.720]  white populations are not the same size when 38 million black americans commit five times as many
[51:36.720 --> 51:43.120]  violent crimes on 197 million whites as they receive what you discover is that black perpetrators
[51:43.120 --> 51:48.080]  violently assault white victims 25 times more frequently and when it comes to a specific
[51:48.080 --> 51:54.640]  kind of violent crime aggravated assault the number of black on white crimes is 200 times higher
[51:54.640 --> 51:59.520]  than white on black crimes running through the lyrics and the entire video is the theme of
[51:59.520 --> 52:05.200]  glover and the dancers serving as a distraction from the chaos going on behind them which is supposed
[52:05.200 --> 52:11.520]  to be an allegory of how entertainment distracts from social justice racism and identity politics
[52:11.520 --> 52:16.720]  the song's first bridge talks about how entertainment media is serving as a distraction from bigger
[52:16.720 --> 52:22.480]  issues at hand what are you talking about the entertainment industry is now wall to wall social
[52:22.480 --> 52:27.840]  justice racism and identity politics you can't get through a late night comedy monologue an
[52:27.840 --> 52:35.440]  nfl national anthem or an award show speech without being bombarded with social justice racism
[52:35.440 --> 52:41.120]  and identity politics this very video has handed the entertainment industry and the media yet
[52:41.120 --> 52:47.440]  another opportunity to endlessly talk about social justice racism and identity politics
[52:47.440 --> 52:52.560]  mainstream america doesn't distract from discussions about racism and social justice
[52:52.560 --> 52:58.400]  it amplifies them at every available opportunity one of the dance moves glover performs is the
[52:58.400 --> 53:03.520]  south african guara-guara to draw a parallel between the racist oppression of black people
[53:03.520 --> 53:09.360]  in south africa and racism in america which is pretty ironic given that racist oppression currently
[53:09.360 --> 53:14.880]  taking place in south africa is overwhelmingly directed towards white people the south african
[53:14.880 --> 53:20.320]  parliament has voted in favor of new legislation that could see land from white farmers seized
[53:20.320 --> 53:26.240]  he has said that he's not calling for the social of white people at least not yet in recent years
[53:26.240 --> 53:32.640]  there has been a spike in the killing of farmers in south africa the guns being attentively taken
[53:32.640 --> 53:38.880]  care of with a red cloth represents how republicans care more about guns than lives another irony
[53:38.880 --> 53:45.280]  given that defensive gun uses by victims are more common than gun uses by violent criminals
[53:45.280 --> 53:50.240]  according to the cdc's own figures firearms violence has also been plummeting for the last
[53:50.240 --> 54:00.240]  20 years even as gun ownership sought gambino says this is sally sally could mean spellwalk
[54:00.240 --> 54:06.240]  a commonly used tool to unjustly keep blacks in a cycle of incarceration yeah 50 percent homicide
[54:06.240 --> 54:12.240]  rate 13 population rate lover also poses and pulls facial expressions like a caricature of
[54:12.240 --> 54:19.280]  jim crow jim crow laws were racial segregation laws enacted by democrats and as kandace owens
[54:19.280 --> 54:25.280]  points out virtually no one complaining about jim crow laws today even lived through the jim
[54:25.280 --> 54:29.760]  crow era victim mentality is not cool i don't know why people like being oppressed the weirdest thing
[54:29.760 --> 54:34.800]  i've ever heard i love oppression we're oppressed 400 years of slavery jim crow which by the way
[54:34.800 --> 54:39.600]  none of you guys live through your grandparents and it's embarrassing that you utilize you utilize
[54:39.600 --> 54:45.840]  their history you're not living through anything right now you're overly privileged americans racism
[54:45.840 --> 54:51.120]  and slavery was a horrific chapter of american history just as it was in every other part of the
[54:51.120 --> 54:57.120]  world where slavery was inflicted on virtually every race on the planet why are we still obsessively
[54:57.120 --> 55:02.880]  talking about this hundreds of years later could it be because democrats don't actually care about
[55:02.880 --> 55:08.320]  black lives it has been a record year in the city chicago and for all the wrong reasons the murder
[55:08.320 --> 55:13.040]  rate has never been higher and the only thing they actually care about is keeping black people
[55:13.040 --> 55:19.200]  locked in a permanent state of mental victimhood so they can get black votes lover trying to escape
[55:19.200 --> 55:24.080]  and run from america which is represented at the end of the video encapsulates the overarching
[55:24.080 --> 55:31.040]  nihilistic message that america is corrupt evil and racist so corrupt evil and racist that it allows
[55:31.040 --> 55:37.200]  glover a black man to reach the top of his game in both acting and the music industry while having
[55:37.200 --> 55:41.600]  one of the most celebrated and talked about songs of the year while appearing on every mainstream
[55:41.600 --> 55:48.000]  talk show on tv while making tens of millions of dollars in the process so racist america is so
[55:48.000 --> 55:53.840]  corrupt and evil it defeated the twin terrors of fascism and communism became the biggest economic
[55:53.840 --> 55:59.520]  powerhouse on the planet created a strong aspirational middle class including a generation of
[55:59.520 --> 56:04.960]  upwardly mobile black families improving the lives of hundreds of millions of americans of all
[56:04.960 --> 56:11.680]  colors and providing endless opportunities for tens of millions of immigrants thereafter so racist
[56:11.680 --> 56:18.640]  but none of that really matters this music video has had over 120 million views in 10 days videos
[56:18.640 --> 56:24.480]  that emphasize its social justice narrative have tens of millions more views this is a potent piece
[56:24.480 --> 56:30.320]  of cultural and political propaganda delivered via the medium of pop culture and me sitting here
[56:30.320 --> 56:37.360]  debunking its delusory sophistic themes isn't going to reach 120 million people we need to create
[56:37.360 --> 56:44.560]  our own art we need to create our own music we need to create our own cultural narrative young
[56:44.560 --> 56:50.560]  people don't identify with social justice narratives because of their objective truth they didn't

[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:37.760]  the truth about childish gambino's new movie new little music video now again poll said one
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.760]  thing though that wasn't true he said well obviously this video i'm putting out won't get 120 million
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:48.240]  views uh poll i've produced documentaries that have been seen 200 million times online
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:52.320]  about other films that have been seen 50 60 70 million times online these are two three hour
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:58.720]  films like loose change obama deception in game you on your own facebook channel hit the site guys
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:05.200]  turn the election you had videos with 37 million views 25 million views but they deleted them when
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:11.680]  you get 37 million views in a week it's going to keep going forever but i love this guy in all
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:17.040]  these top movies reportedly already made like 50 million dollars childish gambino bitching where
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:22.560]  he's running from america hey please run to south africa or run to venezuela and go eat dogs and
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:28.000]  cats against 38 all those run to north korea just stop the bitching man i didn't do jack crap to you
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:35.600]  you rich hollywood person and i resent all your endless race bait and crap and and that's what it
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:40.480]  comes down to i mean i know 12 to 1 it'll be a black guy shoots me or robs me for every time a
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.880]  white guy does that i know the numbers because it's open season on white people it's pushed
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:49.120]  that doesn't mean i blame all black people and i'm a racist like he is but spiky and all these
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:53.760]  guys are nothing but dirt bag chip on their shoulder races who wear this like some type of
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:02:00.560]  crown paul other points you want to make about this there's a photo today of an african-american
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:07.520]  woman hugging trump from behind her daughter was shot in the line of duty you know black woman so
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:14.720]  i mean all violence is bad but the fact is i think the figure is cops are 18.5 times more likely to
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:21.680]  be shot by a black criminal than an unarmed black man is likely to be shot by a cop so obviously
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:26.000]  all violence is bad i want to reduce it as much as possible but this whole narrative that like of
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.480]  african-americans are being hunted down just not true it's not true via and by any foot benchmark
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:39.440]  any statistic the other fact of the matter alex is you know you talked about facebook and possibly
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:47.120]  info wars being banned on facebook from may 24th it's all about the algorithm alex 80 reduction
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:52.640]  in engagement rate on my one of my facebook pages alone the one linked to info wars over the past
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:57.840]  10 days alone it went down even further before that you know i used to put up videos on facebook
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:04.320]  that could get like 300 400 000 views overnight now it's like sometimes it's like 40 000 they're
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:11.120]  listing websites and demoting websites based on their algorithm and they admitted to it so all
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:16.640]  this whining about youtube this is not even the biggest issue the biggest issue is the algorithm
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:22.000]  facebook's now saying oh we're going to rank it on trustworthiness infowars.com brightbar.com
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.680]  they're going to be on the blacklist i post info wars articles on facebook with you know like a
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:33.680]  million combined followers on my pages they get like 10 20 shares you can post a meme it'll get
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:39.200]  it'll get 30 000 shares because they can't list it they can't blacklist it because there's no info
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:44.960]  wars.com link so that's the bigger issue that's what we need people in congress asking them questions
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:51.040]  about as ted cruise did to some extent but we need more of that to happen for this to be changed
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:58.240]  and it's incredible how they're just doing it and then lying about us while the democrats
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:03.760]  sue everybody trying to shut them physically down this is hardcore authoritarianism paul what do you
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:08.960]  make out of the statement that they sent out saying info wars will no longer be allowed to be
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:14.160]  contacted and will no longer be here will no longer be available and of course we make no money on
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:19.360]  them letting republicans contact our listeners that are activists but facebook's saying we're
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.280]  not even going to make money off this which sounds to me like we're just going to be banned on the 24th
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:29.120]  of may well i mean that's that's possibly what it means that or at least means that you know
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:34.160]  shadow going to be able to associate with us with advertising but listen today's um audience
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:40.320]  figures for cnn they've lost 30 of their audience in a week they're collapsing that's why cnn was
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:45.040]  lobbying to shut down our youtube channels because they want to extinguish their i know paul i know
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:49.600]  you gotta go but you're on fire i want to explain yeah them shutting us down and killing free speech
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:53.280]  won't save them and in fact in fact we're just getting more people to our core websites like
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:58.880]  drudge predicted info wars dot com news wars dot com but let's explain they're dead i want to plow
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:05.440]  into all of this but i'm gonna spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:13.280]  that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:20.000]  from info wars store dot com you are funding the revolution i mean i cannot say it any clear
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.160]  and so it is essential that you purchase the products at info wars store dot com i don't
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:28.160]  want to thank everybody that has but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste with colloidal
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:33.680]  silver and with high quality atomic iodine in it you cannot beat that for children and adults
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:38.400]  we've got the best mouthwash designed by dr jones that's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:44.240]  as well info wars life dot com or triple a two five three three one three nine and your purchase
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:49.120]  of the products stands with us stands with america stands with trump stands against the globalist
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:53.360]  and their satanic pedophile armies and that's who they are and they know we know who they are
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:06:09.280]  and they're coming back against us so we need your support
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:25.200]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:50.320]  all right we got jose calzman joining us for the balance the hour here in about two minutes
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:53.760]  but i wanted paul watson because we've been talking about 30 minutes to encapsulate
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:07:00.160]  where we are right now the collapse of mainstream media the death row is trying to openly shut down
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:05.520]  all conservative christian libertarian national speech ahead of the midterms paul encapsulate that
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:12.320]  for folks well the fact is that cnn and all these big media outlets are highly concerned
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:18.000]  basically in a blind panic about our increasing influence despite all the efforts being made
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.480]  against us which as i said before the break are to do with the algorithm there have been studies
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:27.600]  done which show the order in which search results for political candidates are listed and the
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:34.880]  negativity or positivity attached to those search results can shift millions millions of voters in
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:41.040]  national elections they bigger did a big test in india i think it was that proved that um cnn
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:46.880]  today we find out has lost 30 percent of its viewers in the past week now on top of that
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:51.040]  of obviously they got a big boost from their trump derangement syndrome in the short term
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:55.760]  but even with that 90 negative coverage trumps doing well his approval ratings are going up
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:08:01.760]  cnn's viewership is going down and remember their average viewer their average prime time
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:07.200]  viewer is aged 70 years old i think it was actually 60 let's let's be great that's 60 years old it
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:12.080]  used to be 59 it's getting older my average viewer on youtube and i'm not saying i'm competing directly
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:18.640]  with cnn but it's the amalgamation of the alternative independent media my average demographic is 18
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:26.160]  to 35 that's the coveted audience cnn cannot cannot get near that their average viewer is 60 years
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:32.160]  old and getting older every single year so this is why they're trying to shut us down cnn literally
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:38.240]  lobbied for weeks on end to get youtube to shut your channel down my channel down because we
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:43.120]  dared questioned the narrative behind the the gun control push after the parkland shooting
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:46.720]  they seem to have relented on that for the time being but they're just going to keep coming back
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:52.560]  stronger and stronger time and time again and as you've mentioned facebook is now the big perch
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:58.000]  with studies showing that conservative pages on facebook have lost significant amounts of
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:05.120]  traffic i lost 80 in one week last time i checked so we're all slaves to the algorithm this is the
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:11.360]  main focus we need to look at brad pascal trump's 2020 campaign manager is well aware of this that's
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:16.240]  the environment that he comes from we've got people asking questions in congress about it
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:20.720]  so the fight is on this is the new frontier of censorship it's going to be more related to the
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:26.720]  algorithm than actual direct censorship because you know it's it's easier to sell without riling up
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:33.120]  too many people shadow banning and algorithm manipulation is the new frontier of censorship
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:37.840]  that's what they're going to go for all right paul joseph watching excellent job glad youtube's
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:42.640]  backed off for now banning your video uh breaking down hollywood try to push a race war thank you so
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:48.080]  much thanks alex now joining us for the balance of the hour is joel scowles an editor of world
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:55.120]  affairs brief dot com and i wanted to get him on because his uncle clion scowson uh basically
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:00.400]  researched and developed the goals of communism from some of their own documents and public statements
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:06.080]  they got read into the record in 1963 that when you read the goals of communism and you see how
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:13.280]  much it has actually been achieved it is stunning so we reposted this to info wars dot com read the
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:22.240]  secret 45 goals of communism leaked to congress in 1963 in the early 1960s u.s intelligence obtained
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:29.040]  uh the 45 goals communist internationals intended to carry out uh to destroy western
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:33.920]  civilization and christianity i mean i had him write that it was the communist international
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:39.200]  but the point is is that uh you can find this in the congressional record as well and and joel
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:44.320]  scowson joins us to get into this because his uncle helped expose it and how the ultra rich want
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:49.200]  command and control they're making a lot of money right now off the collapse of venezuela
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:54.240]  and then later in the hour we can tie it into current events and things that are unfolding but
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:59.360]  going back to the 60s and the naked communist and w clion scowson and your uncle and now
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:06.160]  where we are today it's it's just amazing well the first point i want to make alex is that my uncle
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:13.840]  wrote this um in the early 60s based upon his research as assistant to jay agrohoover at administrative
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:20.400]  assistant at the fbi headquarters in washington dc but he had not yet discovered the globalist
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:27.680]  conspiracy yet to him everything what looked like a communist conspiracy and as i've gone through
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:34.000]  these 45 goals in uh preparation for your show today it's very interesting because from our
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.840]  perspective now and even if clain were alive today he died in 2006 if he were alive today
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:47.680]  he would agree with me that these goals in fact were globalist goals not exclusive communist
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:53.680]  goals and the reason they got pushed through the communist party is the goblas were using
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:58.800]  communists to break down the social order to break down various countries like nica agua and cuba
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:06.560]  and to and red china uh and so but these were actually engineered by globalists and that's why
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:13.360]  even though most of them have not been implemented by actual communists they have happened because
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:17.760]  the globalists have continued to do that even after they dismantled the house committee on
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:23.680]  unamerican activities even though they got rid of macarthur these goals kept going forward
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:30.480]  because these are globalist goals which share a great commonality with communism well i should
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:35.600]  have said that out of the gates you know when i said from intelligence files that uh clian scow's
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:41.840]  and your uncle was a high-level fbi agent had access to uh you know much of not all the secret
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:47.680]  files and was able to compile this but of course as soon as he and uh others like macarthur to
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:53.600]  explain that there were ultra rich behind communism i guess they got shut down pretty quick well
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:58.400]  the issue it's not so much that the ultra rich controlled directly the communists uh in other
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:04.000]  words the communists are not just not puppets of the western globes they are competing for control
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.360]  of the new world order and the globalists use them for example alger hiss who did join the
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:15.040]  communist party uh henry kissinger who joined the communist party in east germany these were
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:19.440]  globalists who joined the communist party in order to make the communists think that they
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:25.120]  had one of their own in the state department and so as alger hiss led the united states into the
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:30.880]  united nation wrote the charter and brought other communists into f dr's white house and the truman
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:36.400]  administration white house it wasn't really because alger hiss was a communist it was because he was
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:43.200]  a globalist who joined the communist so that they wouldn't question why he was helping them so much
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:49.120]  so this is a very sophisticated deception we're dealing with here and it continues today because
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:54.560]  the globalists are deeply ensconced in every agency of government and continue to push these goals
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:01.120]  well we're going to have plenty of time this hour and maybe five minutes the next hour uh to
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:06.480]  lay all this out but this is real history and when you read the goals you're absolutely right
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:12.560]  this could be called the 45 goals of globalism being carried out by their allies in the whole
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:18.640]  communist system but as you said they are competing factions as well so when we come back from this
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:23.120]  quick break we'll lay it all out but in the minute or so we have before we go to break
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:27.920]  can you speak more to the relationship between people like george soros and others and the
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:32.560]  rockefeller foundation uh with communism and how that whole dialectic works
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:40.160]  well as i say the the the globalist the pure globalists themselves like handi kessinger
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:45.200]  and alger hiss who joined the communist party i mean george soros has not joined the communist party
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:51.920]  they only share the socialist portions of the goals they they use communist in their most
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:57.280]  tyrannical form of course to overthrow governments and then of course the globalists coming and rescue
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:04.160]  those governments like nicaragua and like el salvador and and cuba which hasn't quite happened yet
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:09.120]  but they come in and rescue them with a quasi free market solution which is really a form of
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:14.800]  socialism they sell it it's a form of corporatism for example some of these goals it talks about
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:20.080]  take over the big corporations well the the communists never did take over the big corporations
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:25.920]  not a single one of them but the globalists have have compromised almost every large corporation
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:31.040]  especially international that's right this is the real world system we're talking about
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:35.680]  where they'll overthrow the czars have communism then work with the communists make huge profits
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:39.840]  for themselves out of it then collapse it then come in with oligarchs they control and just do
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:44.640]  the same thing over and over and over again now they're talking about coming in and saving venezuela
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:49.200]  after propping it up for decades we'll be back to go over the 45 goals of globalism
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.200]  which old scowls and from the congressional record

[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.200]  jones
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:40.320]  welcome back i'm alex jones your host we're 20 minutes of the second hour with us a little bit
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:44.720]  in the next hour is jose calvin there's a best-selling author researcher ahead of world
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:49.520]  affairs brief that his own background as an officer in the marine corps naval aviator uh
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:55.520]  one of the top experts on uh building secure homes strategic relocation we sell his documentary film
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:01.760]  and his book and info wars store dot com but all of that uh is is important but not as important as
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:09.600]  his uncle clion scousen who was high-level fbi given access to secret files uh to to investigate
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:15.200]  the communist menace and then wrote the naked communist then wrote the naked capitalist that
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:19.920]  didn't get as much attention but really told the whole story and now if you read what the globalists
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:25.280]  say today or what's in the wiki leaks it is the current real world system we live in so a few
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:32.320]  minutes about clion scousen a few minutes about uh this whole system and then we'll go into though
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:40.480]  the goals the 45 goals of communism uh again leaked to congress via the fbi via clion scousen
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:47.520]  back in 1963 and then let's branch this whole thing out just in a few minutes quantify why this
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:55.200]  is so important and uh what the naked capitalist really is the the dirty secret well alex the
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:22:03.680]  uh clion had a real wake-up call when he found out during the uh overthrow of cuba and batata
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:09.680]  batista uh that uh there were actually high-level people within the state department the second
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:14.560]  floor of the state department which controlled foreign affairs that were really protecting the
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:23.280]  communist whenever uh various pro batista and pro free castro people uh saw who was manipulating
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:29.440]  this situation at the state department they asked for their ouster and uh they were protected clion
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:36.240]  found out by high-level people who were not communist then uh you know when he eventually
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:43.600]  rose the naked communist which was a critique of a book by a globalist uh that was um really not
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:49.760]  authorized by the globalist to speak uh in fact the book was taken out of print uh thereafter his
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:54.800]  widow was threatened not be able to reprint the book because in the book he talks about how they
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:23:01.360]  want to control the media they want to control this is speaking of globalist capitalist uh wealthy
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:06.320]  people who wanted to control the world that they wanted to control both political parties that they
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:13.600]  in essence had controlled both political parties for most uh of the last two decades and so clion
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:18.160]  noticed that in the goals of the 45 communist goals those were those their goals to control
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:25.280]  both political parties and he realized that the communists couldn't actually directly control them
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:30.960]  at best they could get into the socialist party and uh you know a few media people like the the
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:37.360]  nation used to be a very communist uh publication uh but he realized that it was much broader than
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:43.440]  just the communist conspiracy and there were these wealthy capitalists that were uh controlling the
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:49.120]  communists or at least facilitating them coming into the united states and those communists themselves
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:54.080]  thought that the globalists were one of them but they weren't they were secretly facilitating it
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:24:00.640]  and then planning a discarding communism later on after and then along comes you know years later
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:05.760]  than the late 60s quickly from the globalist perspective just certifying from the inside
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:12.080]  1100 pages everything that your uncle has said that's exactly right and uh so the book uh the
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:17.600]  naked capitalist really is a critique of carol quigley's book uh who was a professor at georgetown
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:21.840]  georgetown is full of globalists uh even today they're the ones that teach at the national war
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:26.960]  college and indoctrinate all of our military officers so that they turn out to be globalist
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:32.560]  anybody who gets to be a general or an admiral has to say yes to those systems and so it's only
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:37.280]  natural when you look at these goals look at it through the eyes of globalists helping and
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:42.720]  facilitating communists number one that they should coexist with communism rather than have
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:49.200]  atomic war that was a globalist thing containment number two to contain come that was the doctrine
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:54.720]  of george kenan who was a globalist not a communist and so you see you see globalists
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:01.040]  facilitating all of these doctrines developing in number three the notion of total disarmament
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:06.480]  by the u.s would be the highest moral standard and of course your nuclear freeze people were
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:11.040]  very much associated with the communist party and were a lot of communists involved in the
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:16.080]  anti-nuclear movement but they were being used by the globes to also want to and that ties into the
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:25.280]  7277 that's exactly right um and you know they would promote a number four free trade between
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:29.920]  all nations and we shouldn't exclude communists from free trade so it wasn't really free trade
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:36.000]  it was facilitating trade with communists so that you could uh you know share technology with them
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.920]  was what we did all through china and russia's history number five was extend long-term loans to
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:46.800]  russians and the soviet satellites and you can see obviously the communists would be in favor of
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:52.960]  this but the globalists were also in favor of this as well uh number six was to provide american aid
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:58.800]  to all nations regardless of communist domination same thing like long-term loans aid you don't
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:04.720]  don't want to be prejudiced against communists uh number seven was grant recognition of red china
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:12.160]  and admit red china to the un and oust taiwan i mean it's one thing to admit red china but why oust
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:19.040]  free china taiwan and why give red china a seat on the security council a permanent seat with a
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:24.880]  permanent veto that's got to be for conflict creation purposes and to make sure that that china
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:32.880]  and russia can stop uh any actual freedom agenda and uh and that's exactly what they did number
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:37.680]  eight was to set up east and west germany as separate states in spite of cruz chest promise
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:43.680]  in 1955 to settle the german question by free elections you know what's not told is the u.s
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:50.800]  also never required cruzstaff to give back the six thousand u.s military prisoners of war that
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:27:01.040]  stalling kept as insurance to make sure that the u.s uh carried forth operation keelhaul and uh even
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:08.080]  when we did operation keelhaul the soviet still never gave up the uh the u.s prisoners of war
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:12.320]  or the british prisoner war totaling almost 30 000 people well isn't the korean war a great
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:16.800]  example of standing down for the chai comms to take the half control and making macArthur stand
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:21.760]  down we could have beat him right then because that was a replay of putting malin power in 1949
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:27.520]  the cia it's just a continued basically sabotaging countries to let the communists take over that's
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:33.920]  right i mean americans don't know that the russian general controlled all u.s all military operations
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:39.200]  under un auspices in the korean war and so all macarthur's plans had to go through it russian
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:45.760]  general the only thing that macarthur did not tell the un was his in john landing where he did in a
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:51.840]  encirclement and came in almost up at the dmz had cut the chai comms off at the border he did not
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.560]  tell the un that and they were hopping mad because it was a surprise to them and that's right
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:01.120]  well then he figured out though that his orders were being handed on he said look let's just use
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:04.880]  atomic weapons in this right now we wouldn't have communist china today if he'd done that
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:12.720]  that's right uh and number nine was a uh promote the conferences to ban atomic
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:18.160]  protests and that got through but that was a globalist agenda as well number 10 was to allow
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:22.880]  all soviet satellite countries individual representation in the un that was passed but
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:28.640]  by globalists not necessarily by communists and of course they are free now most of those states
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:33.600]  now and still members of the un but i still contend that most of those have puppet governments that
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:39.360]  are owing to the soviets just like poland and chakras locky under bachlaw hobble were communist
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:45.520]  agents well i know lending to that so many of the e you heads now are former top communist
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:50.320]  and and that that that is a fact america look at anglo-america of germany she was an east german
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:54.960]  communist well they're right back to go over the 45 secret goals of globalism

[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:23.920]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:34.880]  it is so critical for people to understand that what we're saying here is not our opinion
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:42.160]  david rockefeller and many others famously do not want any of this out quickly argued in the late
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:48.560]  60s one of the top professors at george town bill clinton's mentor that we're the elite this is
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:55.200]  the best system let's brag about it but he at least wrote thousand or so copies for the state
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:59.680]  department and cia because he later wrote other books that were widely published where he explained
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:05.040]  all this in the 70s and 80s i know because i read them later my dad had them later on the house so
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:09.520]  i read them when i became a teenager i was just like this is all admitted then when i went to
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.240]  college for a few years i could see the programming and i was like my gosh everything my dad told me
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:21.440]  was true this is an anti-american anti-free market anti-christian anti-family agenda and didn't
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:26.800]  mean like i was some super goody two shoes you know guy going around knocking on doors of the bible
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:33.040]  and i'm not knocking folks to do that i was just i don't want to be conquered and you see them promoting
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:39.280]  socialism and communism and people with 200 skinny jeans with their thousand dollar smartphones
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:44.960]  you know at three thousand dollar uh events like like south by southwest and almost every
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:51.120]  person says i'm a communist i'm a socialist i i i like venezuela and they just giggle and laugh
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:55.920]  like demons and something he said last week we'll we'll push because i have stuff to add we'll push
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:02.320]  and he won't mind um our guest from Italy who's so on target leo zagami just back like five ten
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:08.480]  minutes we have times because i was going late today but you see the disease the evil the corruption
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:14.160]  the the atheism the anti-christian garbage that comes with it and you and then you read the deeper
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:19.200]  text of this and you read the council on foreign relations and all of them admitting what they're
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:25.360]  doing like we're dumb animals they admit the geoengineering they admit the breakup of the family
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:33.520]  they admit all these horrors in their textbooks even for phd's and the phd's laugh and go alex
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:39.680]  the public's never gonna care they're animals you ought to join us that is so fundamentally sick
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:44.320]  and then under them because they treat people like animals because they're the real animals
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:50.080]  these globalist society collapses but they love that because then they've got control over free will
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:55.840]  because they can starve people to death it is it is the most diabolical satanic program not even
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:36:02.160]  from a christian perspective but if i just looked at this program it's what i'd call satanic and
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:06.880]  and how they get people roped in to wanting to follow what are going on with it makes my head
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:12.560]  hurt but but but jill scowles as you continue on here just in the contemporary how they've got
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:17.680]  democrat senator on tv right now during the break saying oh they've got proof that trump you know
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:24.000]  the russians favored him and all this baloney when when it's just it's just amazing to know
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.960]  what traders these people are how they're openly part of an ideology to sell the country out and
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:34.240]  to kill free market for the average person and then they grandstand about how i'm a russian
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:39.600]  agent or trump is or we're agents of this foreign power how they flipped it around when they're the
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:43.920]  foreign globalist and then they somehow turn it around that those of us that are fighting
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:48.800]  we're the bad guys it says you keep saying they'll attack anybody who covers conspiracy
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:53.680]  because that's how they operate that is what they do there is a democrat conspiracy to overthrow
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:57.840]  trump with russia gay there is a conspiracy to get rid of our sovereignty there is a conspiracy
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:02.560]  to get rid of our borders there are open conspiracies to break up our families i mean it's there
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:07.600]  and if you don't approach it from that it's all rearranging deck chairs on the titanic that's my rant
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:15.920]  well it's true alex uh you know going to point number 11 they want to promote the un as the only
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:21.600]  hope for mankind and if its charter is rewritten rewritten demand that they set it up as a one
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:27.440]  world government with its own military independent armed forces now that won't happen and hasn't
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:35.120]  happened yet but that's what world war three is all about and absorbing a nuclear first strike on
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:40.880]  us military forces so that our globalist leaders can come out of their bunkers and induce everyone
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:46.880]  to join a militarized global government that's point number 11 that's a globalist point remember
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:53.120]  that the communists have never really promoted the un as its only hope for mankind they want to
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:58.960]  form their own type of new world order under communist control china wants to form their own
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:04.720]  so they're competing against the western globals to want this form the most sophisticated deceiving
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:10.000]  form because you see only the globalists are sophisticated enough to tell people you're still
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:15.200]  free you still have democracy you still have individual rights like they do in the eu constitution
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:20.400]  but then there are all these exceptions built in you know except when social justice needs this
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:25.680]  and except when society needs the article 30 and 31 then say oh actually you have all these
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:32.240]  rights except for the un says you don't right precisely uh number 12 is resisting any attempt
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:38.080]  to outlaw the communist party you know uh it's this is all about the censorship thing you know
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:43.760]  the liberals are very good about saying you know we don't want to ban anybody but when it comes to
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:49.600]  alex jones and info wars they do want to ban you in other words communists are okay but the
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:55.600]  ultra right the extremists as they call us you know that's never okay and we will face a ban
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:00.000]  just as we are and we're not really what they even call ultra right aren't we just traditional
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.920]  nationalist yes they're against that too they're against anyone who's in favor of western uh
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:11.360]  promoting western civilization or culture you know you can have a black power club at high
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:17.840]  school you can have a latino club you can have a you know you can use black you can use latino
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:23.920]  you can use every name except white you cannot have anything that promotes the caucasian uh
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:31.360]  culture or race and not that we need to that's not the point we can let history speak for itself
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:36.320]  but it really is a one-sided and very hypocritical politically well they know under the christian
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:40.960]  ethos that we want to have everybody come together so they use our strength against us
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:46.240]  and and and then and then try to make minorities all under communist systems liberation theology
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:54.480]  race-based uh so that all just explodes so they can decentralize uh and then and then
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:58.320]  bring everything back into a consolidated system but first they want to create the crisis of the
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:04.480]  race war that's right that's right number 13 they want to do away with loyalty owes now that
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:08.240]  loyalty owes came about because of the macarthur area and taking a loyalty oath but you know we
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:14.240]  still have the constitutional oath unfortunately it is not being enforced nobody has been prosecuted
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:20.640]  for violating the constitution it's just a hollow form of an oath that we use today number 14
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:25.600]  continued giving russia access to the u.s patent office and that was a globalist school because
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:31.280]  that's how they gave russia technology secrets without directly transferring and look and look
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:37.360]  at china today they take it the day it's posted there that's exactly right uh number 15 capture
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:41.120]  one or both political parties in the u.s now the communists never did this but the globalists
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:47.200]  of course have done both it captured both the democratic and republican parties and run them
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:53.520]  you know as party a and party b but they're both globalist parties number 16 use technical
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:57.920]  decisions of the courts to weaken basic american institutions this is done through
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:06.560]  the aclu of fabian socialists and others uh which started out as outright communist fronts
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:15.280]  uh and now have a more uh you know mainstream view but in point of fact they have controlled
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:20.480]  now the actual courts and not because the judges themselves are communist but they are globalist
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:24.400]  and those that aren't globalists that are under control are under blackmail they have a tremendous
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:30.560]  not a blackmail of judges to keep them uh in control especially those who are extensively
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:35.360]  conservatives in the supreme court like judges robertson justice thomas they have ample blackmail
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:42.800]  on them to turn them as they did uh justice robertson the obama care decision number 17 get
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:47.120]  control of the schools well frankly the communists have not got control of the schools but the
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:52.640]  globalists certainly have and that's been going on ever since the founding of the public school
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:57.040]  movement was meant to take it away from private hands take it away from a great example is bill
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:01.040]  gates they use the government running it to ruin it and then have the new corporate takeover that's
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:07.280]  even worse which is the globalization of schools that's exactly right gain control number 18 of
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:14.000]  all student newspapers well there really aren't a lot of communists except in a few major ivy
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:19.040]  universities but it's it's hard to tell the difference between a hardcore communist and a
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:26.080]  a hardcore leftist and almost all students at the leadership level have left us at major universities
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:30.640]  we gotta go to break but yeah yeah there's socialist communists but they don't even know they're a
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:36.000]  communist they'll laugh at it even though some of them have like mal tattoos and stuff that they
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:42.080]  think it's cute it's funny and they go oh we only want communism for america and we're like oh because
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:45.840]  it doesn't work anywhere else but it's going to work here what they really want is to be in control
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:49.760]  they see that they're creating a new hierarchical system and they believe because they're college
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:57.600]  students they'll be part of the anointed new priesthood they're really authoritarians western
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:03.520]  europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:11.120]  over the uk they're set to pass rules not a law that if you criticize islam or gays you'll get six

[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:26.480]  emergency going on but i want to say something right up front here i don't take on george
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:31.120]  soros and the globalists because i have a death wish i do it because they're instinctive and
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:37.520]  in spiritual level i cannot give in to them because i know they're pure evil so it's it's
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:42.800]  it's like a burning in the bones and they've told me in a bunch of lawsuits they'll just add a thing
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:47.840]  about calling george soros a nazi and i've been known stop calling him a nazi leave him alone
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:53.840]  kiss his ring and you'll be left alone and years ago there was overtures from the whole soros
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:58.320]  combine and then facebook said oh try your facebook now and i'd have like two million views on every
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:02.880]  video they unblocked me then about a month later that you're not being nice to zuckerberg boom you're
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:07.520]  blocked now i'm gonna be totally banned that's fine i'm not trying to make it in your system
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:12.880]  but that said i don't want to get up here and for everybody just to act all jolly about this
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:16.640]  and i don't like to even let the enemy know they're having an effect but they know what they're
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:21.520]  doing they i want to grow i want to go 24 hours a day at least 20 hours a day by the end of the
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:28.160]  year i want to expand we're having a big effect on tv now on on cable and stuff but you know we're
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:31.760]  about two million dollars behind what we were last year that sounds like a lot of money it's not just
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:38.480]  the uplinks and stuff's like a million bucks a year okay and so blocking us from advertising online
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:43.760]  bunch of places going after sponsors all the crap they pulled not to mention all the lawsuits
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:50.480]  two million behind so it's simple if they could start making us contract their winning

[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:52.160]  it the public being so weak and so evil and i'm not perfect either but i'm way more moral
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:56.480]  compared to most people and just in the work ethic here and people are very lazy they don't even
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:00.720]  want to work i like to work and i'm just saying civilization we're losing it folks everybody's
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:06.000]  getting depressed mental illnesses exploding this is all admittedly scientifically done we're under
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:11.360]  very high tech attack only being fully conscious of it gives you any shot and asking jesus christ
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  you know for protection and i'm serious that's all that really does at the end of the day work
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:20.640]  against this evil and i'm gonna leave it at that some of the stuff they've pulled on me all i can
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:25.920]  say is god jesus it's yours please help me this is a very critical time folks better know it and
[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:32.240]  i need you to go to info or store.com if you want to see us rampage forward now they may just put a
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:35.920]  bullet in me but i don't think they want to turn me into a martyr instead they want to assassinate my
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:40.480]  character and they want to try to slow us down and destroy us i don't see that happening but
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:47.680]  if it continues and and people don't buy the products and the t-shirts and the stuff you need
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:54.640]  anyways when it's already so great then they will cause us to contract if you understand this is a
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:59.520]  war a fight we're all in and we've been chosen as an example here kind of like we're your gladiator
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:04.240]  or you're champion i'm not perfect believe me like an el sit analogy where they have two guys fight
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:09.920]  decide you know for the kingdoms instead of having a full blown war it's kind of like that and when
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:14.800]  they bring me down they've said openly they're going to try to come after everybody else next
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:19.360]  show facebook is announcing that we're basically banned the 24th we're going back to joel scowze
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:23.440]  and i appreciate him going through the goals of globalism which are really the goals of communism
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:28.880]  and intertwined i said world affairs brief dot com i have a copy of it from the congressional record
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:34.480]  on info wars dot com but but we're understanding the real system according to them this isn't
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:39.360]  all the smoke screens and the rest of it you're getting the real enchilada okay please continue
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:43.040]  with the goals or you can comment on what i just talked about here we'll have two more segments to
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:49.200]  finish up on the goals it's your choice i just have to put out those ss those sos you know
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:53.440]  emergency transmissions the listeners so they understand just how serious this fight's gotten
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:58.720]  oh it is it is very serious alex and you really are the tip of the spear and
[01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:05.360]  the main target for them so uh we do need to help and support your efforts
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:11.040]  number 19 is to you is something communists are very deeply involved and still are to this day
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:16.320]  and that is using a student protest anytime george soros wants to gin up a protest against
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:23.680]  trump or immigration or gun control he calls the the communist organizers who bring out the student
[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:30.800]  protest and of course there's a lot of follow on follow on people in in the public schools because
[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:35.120]  they're all trained in liberalism and in colleges so it's very easy to go beyond the communist
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:41.600]  cadres those are the core people that they still use to gin up protests number 20 is infiltrate
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:46.560]  the press that's something that globalists have done much more than the communist same thing with 21
[01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:52.240]  which is gaining control of key positions and radio tv and motion pictures there were communist
[01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:59.440]  oriented people a lot of those were soft communists not outright communist organizers and uh the left
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:05.200]  of course is predominant in all of the media here and it's not just the left-wing media really is a
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:12.080]  pro-government media which means that controlled by the globalist control system the deep state if you
[01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:20.640]  will cia pays for a lot of journalists up to $50,000 a year they pay off judges they collect
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:26.880]  these payoffs at casinos oftentimes in chips so that they can launder these bribes to judges
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:33.840]  number 22 through 24 talk about discrediting and destroying american western culture
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:39.120]  while that's a communist school that's also a globalist goal that's what creating conflict and
[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:45.120]  driving muslim refugees into europe is all about that's what's driving latin americans to the united
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:50.480]  states not so much because they're that much different in culture because it waters down the
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:56.560]  conservative voting values but you know you control art critics you control and get rid of laws
[01:54:56.560 --> 01:55:02.000]  controlling obscenity and you loosen up censorship when it comes to communism but then you tighten
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.040]  down censorship when it comes to the right wing which we're seeing and talking about today
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:14.560]  promoting pornography 25 that's been done you know a lot of these things like obscenity and
[01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:18.320]  pornography there's a tremendous amount of satanic influence on the lives of people that
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:26.240]  promotes this you don't have to be a communist to get on this bandwagon for promoting the libertine
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:33.120]  lifestyle and the pornography there's a natural natural man incentive to go that direction by
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:36.720]  the way that was a term i misused about five years ago i'm a libertarian i'm a libertine
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:41.120]  my dad's like libertine means you're like a satanic sex person alex don't use that so
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:46.240]  sometimes i use the wrong terms but absolutely i mean behind all this really is a satanic influence
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:52.960]  yes that's right we can't underestimate that and especially when it comes to the degeneracy of
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:56:03.520]  sexual and and one's natural sexuality homosexuality transgender all of the
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:07.600]  stuff that's being promoted there's very much a satanic agenda that isn't to say that all
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:14.560]  homosexuals are satanic some of those are just consuming their own particular less and going
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:22.000]  after sex in a way that the lord doesn't approve of but in any case this combined with the next
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:29.920]  school's 27 28 and 29 about eliminating religion as an eliminating prayer in schools and religious
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:34.480]  expressions by government this is very much the dumbing down of religion and a lot of its
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:40.160]  voluntary pastor chuck Baldwin has been very vocal about the fact that the mainstream churches
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:45.280]  just won't take a stand against and let's remember when this was said in congress is 63 with your
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:50.000]  uncle from the FBI exposing it this sounded like space alien talk people couldn't believe this
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:55.440]  would ever happen and we look at it it's almost all happened that's right this has all happened
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:57:00.800]  that especially the dumbing down of religion i mean it's very difficult to find any religion even a
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:06.800]  lot of traditional evangelical religions which used to be hardcore conservatives are very very soft
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:11.520]  conservatives now they won't stand up to government a lot of that happened during the george w bush
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:16.080]  regime when dairy fall well and others got invited to the white house for friday prayer breakfast
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:20.160]  and then we saw obama go after him with the irs we'll be right back in two minutes with joe
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:25.280]  scowls and two more segments to finish up the 45 goals of the communists which you were then learned
[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:29.360]  were the globalists uh and again this is critical information two different groups with the same
[01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:34.720]  agenda kind of big tech giants all want to have the ai god all in a place humans all believe they're
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:38.480]  going to merge with machines unless your elan musk he's worrying about it but they're all fighting

[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:19.760]  segment ten minutes the next and we'll get you out of here sorry i got you on late we had some
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:24.240]  big emergency breaking news earlier with censorship that's just going into total high gear but
[02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:28.640]  finishing up with what you were getting into with the takeover of the churches you were just
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:34.640]  mentioning in the next communist goal you know this has not been so much as a direct takeover
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:40.560]  by a communist this has been a use of political correctness to sensitize pastors so that they
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:44.800]  don't want to do anything to offend homosexuals you don't want to do anything to offend liberals
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:50.800]  and so it just excused the the conversation and the narrative in churches to the soft social
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:55.600]  doctrine you want to talk about the soft jesus christ the all-loving jesus you never talk about
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:00.480]  the fury of the lord the millstone around the neck of those that abuse children or any of the hard
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:06.640]  doctrines uh of jesus christ it's only now the soft version of christian christ beating people
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:11.600]  with cat or nine tails be overturning tables kicking bankers in the face samson tumbling
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:16.720]  down buildings on top people uh you moses throwing down tablets burning people to death there's none
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:22.400]  of that that's right and there's no remembrance of the fact that jesus called the Pharisees he
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:27.520]  vipers and hypocrites i mean those were the strongest words you could use in the jewish as
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:34.240]  culture and so this was hardly loving your neighbor in the embracing sort of way and that's what
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:39.760]  christianity has become only the soft version but you know this the goals 29 and 30 discredit the
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:44.720]  u.s constitution is old fashioned and discredit the founding fathers that's really been taken over
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:50.240]  by the liberals in the universities they really the globalists aren't trying anymore to get rid
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:55.200]  of the constitution they are content to control the constitution through legal interpretation
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:59.360]  in fact you talk about well they're killing it by fiat though but i mean i mean for all
[02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:04.800]  of its purposes they're overriding that's right but they're not eliminating it they can work within
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:11.040]  it i mean that's their response they're just twisting it up in pretzels yes and any constitutional
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:15.840]  says we want to restore the constitution says we don't mind because we interpret the constitution
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:21.840]  according to case law and that's exactly what they do um of course you have control of teachers
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:26.560]  of american history so that you've restored american history and culture and refuse to talk
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:32.160]  about the things that really enhance the second amendment or the christian base of american culture
[02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:38.640]  all that was a communist school and it's also a globalist school number 32 is support any socialist
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:43.360]  movement to give government more centralized control in social agencies welfare programs
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:49.280]  especially drawing upon the heartstrings of americans to give give give and internationally as well
[02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:56.000]  even though we're essentially bankrupt as a nation um number 34 eliminated the house of
[02:03:57.120 --> 02:04:01.200]  house committee on american activities they did do that that was through american liberals
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:06.560]  not through the communists themselves number 35 has not happened discredited and eventually
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:12.400]  dismantled the fbi basically the deep state took over the fbis we've seen with commie and
[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:19.040]  and moeller and and and even now with christian array and insider in the fbi they did not dismantle
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:24.640]  it and don't intend to dismantle it because they've now co-opted the fbi made it a tool of the deep
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:31.520]  state infiltrate and control more unions yes that incurred in spades unions used to be especially
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:38.720]  totally controlled by communist front organizations now they're simply you know deep into corruption
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:45.040]  not necessarily communism uh number 37 they did not gain control of big business but the globalist
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:48.640]  did let's come back over the final few and i'm gonna give you the floor in the segment to really

[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:27.360]  jose calisthenes here for one more segment then leo zagami is going to be joining us with
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:31.280]  the huge developments of the vatican that affect everything because the vatican is now a hundred
[02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:35.840]  percent globalist you could argue about the past or whatever but it is now a world government
[02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:42.800]  christianity is bad open to islam one world government communism is good it is just insane
[02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:48.160]  so that's all coming up and then i've got some other news we're going to weave into this and
[02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:53.200]  in tina this the article is up on info wars dot com it's on news wars dot com read the secret 45
[02:06:53.200 --> 02:07:00.960]  goals of communism leaked via fbi investigation to congress 1963 when leon scousen the uncle of
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:08.160]  or clion scousen the uncle of jose calisthenes with us now expose it and again this is critical as he
[02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:12.800]  follows the last few communism was never meant by the globalists to take full control they just
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:18.080]  financed it and controlled it to break up countries to kill the christians then come in the globalists
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:25.120]  as saviors and then bring in a quasi system we saw three years ago obama went to argentina chile uh
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:31.120]  and uh also he went to africa but he gave the same speech now you need communism but you also
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:35.840]  need big corporations you'll be communist and then the corporations will work with you so he put it
[02:07:35.840 --> 02:07:42.960]  all together and the people are like hmm these are all phd students so this is the system uh so so
[02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:47.280]  joel finish up the other points and i'm going to give you the floor here and then just get into then
[02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:51.840]  how we tie all this together because we are breaking down right now the true global system
[02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:57.920]  that we're operating under goal number 38 was to transfer some of the arrest powers of police to
[02:07:57.920 --> 02:08:03.840]  social agencies now while that hasn't happened what has happened is the subsidiary of that goal
[02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:09.520]  to treat all behavior problems of psychiatric orders to give psychiatrists more power to
[02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:13.760]  incarcerate people for psychiatric that's a thing that the communists were very very good at the
[02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:20.160]  soviet agency we're heading towards that um and they do the left does dominate the psychiatric
[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:25.920]  profession uh you know they refuse psychiatrists refuse to talk about the key things that really
[02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:31.920]  understand human behavioral problems one the innateness of the spirit of the man which comes
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:37.280]  certain predisposition of some good and some evil uh the workings of conscience and the how
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:42.160]  satan and the lord interact with people and how they reject the lord sometimes and get taken over
[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:49.760]  by satanic influence especially suicide or use a gun to commit crimes etc those are something
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:55.520]  that psychiatrists cannot cure society's ills or even now analyze them correctly without
[02:08:55.520 --> 02:09:00.880]  understanding the role of conscience and the role of satan to speak to people's minds which they do
[02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:07.520]  not accept unfortunately uh discredit the family as an institution number 40 and make a divorce
[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:13.520]  easy that has happened happened through liberals not necessarily through communists uh emphasize
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:18.480]  the need to raise children away from the negative influence of parents goal number 41 now that is
[02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:24.400]  a communist goal but that has not and will not be implemented directly in the united states
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:30.240]  but the role of the public schools in basically taking over the raising children and indoctrinating
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:36.720]  them and schooling them and uh you know making them susceptible to homosexuality that's happening
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:42.720]  and that is a globalist goal that has been accomplished uh unlike communist country they
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:48.240]  take children away from parents number 42 create the impression of violence and interaction on
[02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:54.240]  legitimate aspects of american tradition that goes back to the protests and the left background
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:10:00.080]  in protest uh number 43 has been fully accomplished over through all colonial governments and turn
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:06.800]  them over to pro-communist regimes as they did in africa number 44 internationalized the panama
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:12.320]  canal the communist frankly didn't do that jimmy carter and the globalists did it uh and it has
[02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:18.080]  helped the communist but it was more for globalist purposes and number 45 is very important it has
[02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:25.840]  not happened repeal the connolly reservation where this was a in accepting the world court
[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:32.880]  the u.s. Senate passed the connolly reservation basically that we can reject world court jurisdiction
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:39.040]  for anything that interferes with national sovereignty or u.s. internal policy and other
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:45.120]  countries have adapted forms of that too and that's what has kept the world court at bay uh all of
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:56.480]  these years and so that number 45 has not been accomplished and so uh in general what i want
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:11:05.360]  to say is that uh these goals are moving forward under the ages of globalism which uses communism
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:11.520]  and it's very much pointing americans towards what life is going to be like in a globalist world
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:18.160]  government i can tell you very very strongly that when globalist government comes it will not be like
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:23.040]  communist tyranny they will not be ownership of all the means of protection you'll still have
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:29.280]  private companies but it'll be more like fascism they control the companies they control you through
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:34.400]  taxation they control through you through politically correct mandates for example you've
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:38.480]  got a 50 percent women on your boards of directors you've got to have certain amount of latinos and
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:43.360]  certain amount of blacks there'll be quotas oh you're still free you have all these rules and
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:50.240]  controls which will restrict your ability to be free and that's why there's the beating everyone
[02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:54.240]  over the head that you're racist if you're white you're racist if you're white but it was england
[02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:58.640]  worldwide that fought a bunch of wars to enslave or even attack dust over it all these muslim
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:03.600]  countries are still running it but no one cares you know i was out with friends on a boat this
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:12.160]  weekend with my children and i pulled in to get some gas and these were i they said they were
[02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:15.680]  ethiopian but then they kind of act like they were muslim and they said you know we're really
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:21.120]  disappointed in your video saying that blacks don't have any technology about south africa and i
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:25.440]  said i didn't say that no technology ever came out of there and they said well was this video
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:29.920]  and i go you mean the video where south african black leaders are calling for genociding whites
[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:34.800]  and taking their land and the guys smiled said yeah that video and it was like i was supposed to
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:41.600]  be guilted and feel bad when i'm in there buying gas and stuff at this little floating gas station
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:47.600]  out there on the lake and it was like this pride that i'm the bad white person and they're the good
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:51.120]  people and i'm the bad guy i'm gonna get them on the show i got the guys number i said hey come on
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:56.480]  in here you know show me what i said show me what i did and it's just this thing of like everybody's
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:04.080]  fighting to get into uh the us or europe or australia but then the communist deputy leader in the
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:08.880]  defense department in south africa and the current president you know are saying oh you whites you're
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:14.080]  not allowed to leave but if you do give us all your property and then calling australia racist if
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:18.960]  they take whites but then african athletes go for the olympics in australia or sporting events
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:23.920]  i've got it the news today and they're all trying to stay there so all i'm saying is i i've never
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:27.520]  done anything to anybody and i'm just sick of hearing about it all day and the media beating me over
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:32.800]  the head and then people acting like they've got some type of status over me because i'm white this
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:38.880]  is the very type of cultural racism that that they claim they're fighting and it's just force fed
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:46.400]  everywhere and it's disgusting and i'm sick of it but you're right alex class warfare is the name
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:51.440]  of the game coming up and it's going to get bad it's part of the class conflict and the more
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:56.240]  they bring in different cultures incompatible cultures into western culture the easier it's
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:02.000]  going to be to have and you can see hollywood is just 24 seven i mean it's just thousands of movies
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:07.600]  shows everything is just over the top but people are rejecting it hollywood's going bankrupt the
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:13.520]  cnn's collapsing but they don't care they just keep pressing it well i think a lot of their
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:19.280]  bankruptcy is because of their over the top cost uh not because a lot of ignorant people aren't going
[02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:24.000]  to those movies and that's the problem is that public schooling is probably the greatest danger
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  to us culturally and that we are destroying western culture we're making religion laughable
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:35.200]  in public schooling uh we teach them nothing about the constitution nothing about the rule of law
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:41.520]  other than knee jerk follow government type of rule of law so i think public schooling is our
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:45.360]  greatest danger and if i would have any message if you really want to change things you need to
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:50.160]  get your children out of public schools start homeschooling them we're using private schooling
[02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:55.600]  start organizing yourself into churches because if you continue to lose your children to the
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:15:01.360]  public schools you are not going to be able to save them from the social doctors and social
[02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:07.840]  mulu bulu that is that they're swimming in well there's no doubt this is a scientific plan to
[02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:12.560]  bring down civilization it's in the wiki leagues they admitted it's amazing jules kaussman editor

[02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:51.440]  live news analysis with roger stone as well ladies and gentlemen here is the big announcement
[02:20:52.240 --> 02:20:59.840]  if you just tuned in we've got leo zegami the best-selling author vatican insider somebody who
[02:20:59.840 --> 02:21:06.560]  has been so on target with everything going on in the vatican for the 15 years i've been aware of
[02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:14.560]  him it is staggering and folks know i don't just say this about really any of our guests the information
[02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:20.880]  is just unbelievable five years before we ever heard of this current pope he said he'll be your
[02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:26.160]  next pope and then there'll be another pope still living at the same time to set the precedent
[02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:33.120]  and then you'll have two popes at once and then he will resign later to set the precedent that
[02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:39.920]  it's like an office you hold for four to six years the pope announced that yesterday he also
[02:21:40.560 --> 02:21:48.400]  exposed cardinal pel many years ago as running giant pedophile rings to black male the vatican
[02:21:48.400 --> 02:21:54.000]  later it came out in the guardian that indeed that's how this new black pope or jesuit pope
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:22:00.240]  got in he was then the first person to report that the trial would be blacked out and that no one
[02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:08.800]  would know about it at leo zegami dot com days later weeks later it all comes out word for
[02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:13.920]  word what he said so this is so critical because the globalists have totally seized control of
[02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:18.960]  vatican they're trying to destroy the good elements of the catholic church pro family
[02:22:18.960 --> 02:22:25.680]  things like that anti-abortion and you have an ecumenical true luciferian takeover here is
[02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:31.520]  leo zegami dot com the vatican attempts complete media ban of cardinal pel's trial that was days
[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:38.800]  before it was then mainstream news uh pope says he thought about when it's time to take leave and
[02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:43.760]  says that he set the precedent these are quotes from the pope from vatican city that you can have
[02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:50.240]  two popes or three popes at once word for word with leo zegami has said cardinal pel's sexual
[02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:55.920]  abuse trials may be held in secret now the new york times after the zegami breaks it days ago
[02:22:55.920 --> 02:23:02.080]  confirms that prosecutors seek media ban on trial of papal aid this is the guy that delivered a
[02:23:02.080 --> 02:23:06.480]  little boys to the other pedophile cardinals they're not all pedophiles but this is how the
[02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:12.640]  left takes over australia court staffer fired for reading charges against cardinal pel even court
[02:23:12.640 --> 02:23:19.520]  staffers aren't even allowed to know but we know it's hundreds of traffic children but here's the
[02:23:19.520 --> 02:23:26.160]  big one pel's trial and other scandals may finally push the pope to finally resign that's the big news
[02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:32.320]  is can we get rid of this evil pope and not get another counterfeit globalist in there and can
[02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:37.360]  we push armageddon and this whole thing down the road a little bit for those of us that love our
[02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:43.040]  children because if he didn't say tanning calling for open borders and the islamification of europe
[02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:48.000]  and and and ordering churches to take down crucifix and put up you know islamic iconography if this
[02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:55.520]  guy isn't an antichrist spirit then i don't know what is joining us as leo zegami again from rome
[02:23:55.520 --> 02:24:01.760]  amazing leo you you you know everything before it comes out and i don't know of no one else because
[02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:07.200]  i tracked this that does so amazing job with your sources briefly without giving away sources how do
[02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:13.920]  you do it and then tell us what's currently happening well i always stay in touch with my sources
[02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:20.640]  even a couple of hours ago i got a breaking info regarding the new grandmaster of the nights of
[02:24:20.640 --> 02:24:27.280]  malta that might ask himself now to resign after there is much discontent in the traditionalist
[02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:34.160]  nights of malta and as you know also somebody from the court proceedings regarding cardinal pel
[02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:41.280]  broke from the internal computer system trying to access information on cardinal pel and that
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:47.520]  immediately was reported by the court this morning during the trial that is assuming of
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:55.120]  course the characteristics of a very important moment for the history of the church and at the
[02:24:55.120 --> 02:25:01.680]  same time in rome we have all the chilean cardinals my family also part of my family comes from chile
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:07.200]  my grandfather was born in chile even if he was of Scottish descent and my ex-family house in
[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:12.480]  Valparaiso is even a monastery donated to the catholic church so i'm very close to the catholic
[02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:19.680]  church in chile which is suffering through this pedophilia that has involved many cardinals many
[02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:27.360]  bishops from chile and now of course they all went to rome so the pope is really having problems
[02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:35.280]  with this escalation sudden on both sides in australia and chile and he is finally announcing
[02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:40.960]  what we have been saying for years that he might resign but that's because he wants to avoid of
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:48.720]  course also impeachment from his own cardinals that are criticizing everything he has done which
[02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:54.000]  is really putting the church in a very bad position also here in italy in the last few hours
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:01.920]  politically the church is criticizing both Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio that are
[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:07.680]  trying to do this coalition of populist forces to save italy but the Vatican is against it and
[02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:13.120]  probably they're not going to be able to put together this government because also the EU
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:19.760]  is against them criticizing them even before they start so this is a dictatorship both political
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:29.200]  and religious that sees the Vatican embedded with the left wing worldwide it is simply totally
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:33.840]  transparent and is outraged traditional catholics which are the real catholics out there who are
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:39.360]  great people in my experience really bedrock of fighting corruption just to see it totally take
[02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:45.680]  over via a pedophile scandal that i remember you talking about over a decade ago i remember
[02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:50.640]  my 2005 six seven watching videos of you and i ordered a few of your books and thinking man
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:54.160]  this guy claims he knows it all and then seeing that you were you were accurate because you live
[02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:59.200]  in Rome and have family in chili where he's from and have been deeply connected to the church so
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:04.640]  obviously you have a lot of sources of the more traditional conservatives as i witnessed when i
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:09.520]  traveled around with you in Rome for days all the places you took us into and you know the way
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:14.800]  the guards treated you and all you know all the other things but but looking at this i'm concerned
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:18.480]  that it's like he's finishing his work he just took over the night some malta he's doing things
[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:23.040]  that haven't happened ever he's consolidating and then he kind of goes away and then who like
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:28.400]  shark teeth rolls in behind that i mean i'm really worried if it looks like he's about to finally fall
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:33.360]  what a monstrous counterfeit that that that what may be coming in and that power struggle
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:44.320]  what might come in is a pope from africa that is 90 percent possibilities that we get an african
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:51.840]  pope because of course is from the third world is from those places which actually are bringing
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:59.360]  a major influx of immigrants into europe and so they are preparing to receive them pop francis
[02:27:59.360 --> 02:28:06.320]  is in bed with the globalists so he's of course he knows what he's doing but i think in the last
[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:12.480]  a few days he's really having trouble in keeping all all this together because there is major
[02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:19.920]  criticism coming within certain establishment and i mean if the grandmaster that is just being nominated
[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:25.600]  of the nights of malta resigns well that would be the final draw i think that at that point
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:31.840]  pope francis will have to resign immediately but at the moment the the fact he has already
[02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:39.600]  announced this possibility means that he's gonna resign in the coming months and you remember alex
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:44.560]  when i announced three years ago the possibility that this pope will resign what kind of criticism
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:50.400]  we got oh no stay there i mean but word for word what you said is what he's saying he says i set
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:55.280]  the precedent with with what happened with rat singer so i can do it again i mean he says what
[02:28:55.280 --> 02:28:59.760]  you said this is dianne billard you the irish money you can't pay our tax debts crippling you

[02:34:33.840 --> 02:34:38.400]  even though there's really not a lot of profit in each item once we do that the trap is you

[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:26.720]  thousand reviews five star reviews by power reviews because if you do the combo pack that's just a
[02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:32.720]  week old special where you get all of them together 50 off and free shipping but there's no reviews
[02:35:32.720 --> 02:35:38.800]  so it has zero reviews yeah look at us three thousand four hundred plus five star reviews on
[02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:44.320]  third party sites no one's got that i really should be reading these reviews more on air but just
[02:35:44.320 --> 02:35:48.320]  see why they're so great there's no fillers no additives and then you're funding the tip of the
[02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:53.600]  spear in the face of the globalist and all these guests we have on i have the guest on that are
[02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:58.240]  accurate i have the guest on that have proven they know what they're talking about i have the guest
[02:35:58.240 --> 02:36:02.720]  on that are being persecuted i have the guest on that are changing the world i have that's what
[02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:08.400]  we're doing we are saying somebody's got to do it somebody's got to stand up to soros and hillary
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:12.960]  somebody's got to say no to them somebody's got to do it and we're here we're going all the way to
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:20.320]  the end and you know what leo zigami's the first person up there saying this jesuit communist
[02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:25.360]  globalist was going to take over using pedophilia and that his right hand man was a pedophile
[02:36:25.360 --> 02:36:30.800]  procurer a renfield it's all he's now indicted he's in court it's all secret so now that you
[02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:34.880]  told us how you knew all this leo because you are not just saying this you are when it comes to the
[02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:39.200]  vatican you're the most accurate guy out there and i know you've been part of the branch of the
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:45.200]  illuminati the real deal the whole nine yards have exposed it uh as a christian eliminist which
[02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:49.360]  is what christ really did they're the satanic counterfeit of that everything they do is a
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:53.040]  counterfeit so there's always a real thing and then there they're the counterfeit then people
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:56.720]  see the real thing and they think oh wait you must be the bad thing because the bad thing's
[02:36:56.720 --> 02:37:02.320]  masquerading is the real thing like blend bet tries to do with me or ben Shapiro but you have laid
[02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:07.200]  this out you have predicted it all so we're really listening to you right now because even if you're
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:12.320]  not a catholic folks this affects europe the whole world globalism this guy is one of the main weapons
[02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:18.960]  being used he says he wants fake news ban he runs georgetown savagely suing us calling for us to be
[02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:25.200]  shut down i mean we are under attack by by the by the literal jesuit institution uh hillary called
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:32.160]  herself a jeewittical thinker uh well my god if that's catholic then i'll eat my horse uh i mean
[02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:38.400]  this is just insane so you predicted it all you said they'd have a secret trial it's now happening
[02:37:39.040 --> 02:37:44.880]  so let's move into this trial cardinal pell this ghoulish procure what he's actually known for
[02:37:44.880 --> 02:37:50.240]  doing that's come out before that you first broke that they've now sealed from the media and even
[02:37:50.240 --> 02:37:56.000]  the court clerk criminal charges for looking at it what you're supposed to do this is unbelievable
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:03.520]  so so again uh how are they even having a kangaroo trial or court in australia uh uh uh of the
[02:38:03.520 --> 02:38:09.440]  pedophile pubs procure uh for compromising folks and does this pope like little boys little girls
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:13.120]  or is it just me because i know a lot of them don't actually have sex with the kids they just
[02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:16.880]  use it to control everybody under them and so we should also talk about that leo zegami
[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:24.240]  well as you know there is an international pedophile ring and part of this pedophile ring
[02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:30.560]  is even run by terrorists like isis and people like al baghdadi now information that in the
[02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:36.000]  vadigan is circulating in the last few hours is that al baghdadi is somewhere in syria protected
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:42.080]  by the vadigan and the americans and he's still alive and this is an information that i got also
[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:48.160]  this afternoon from luciano consorti who is a member of daisies and a journalist in italy
[02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:54.560]  and this is of course a big news mecain is apparently protecting of course baghdadi but
[02:38:54.560 --> 02:39:02.480]  of course mecain is also very sick in the last few days and his health is deteriorating so
[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:09.760]  there is a situation here where the isis has helped the vadigan and the mondialis pushing
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:15.280]  these migrants towards the invasion of europe and my way it erupts and so on this sounds insane
[02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:20.800]  the pope what six months ago an a year ago said isis is like jesus spreading the gospel
[02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:28.960]  yes unfortunately yes so that that is his words it's a scandalous and it's very scandalous that
[02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:36.400]  al baghdadi who said to be dead is not dead at all and is actually hidden in a secret base in syria
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:41.680]  protected by the americans because there is a compromise here being made by the way i was told
[02:39:41.680 --> 02:39:47.200]  that my high-level army sources months ago i never went on air with it lay it out slow for folks
[02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:51.760]  secret u.s bases protecting al qaeda isis trump doesn't even know this or understand it he keeps
[02:39:51.760 --> 02:40:00.560]  ordering it shut down explain this well of course there is these bases and they are protecting
[02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:07.840]  al baghdadi because he's counted as a resource against the russians which of course are still
[02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:14.240]  the enemies of the liberals and the enemies number one of the democrats at least in this
[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:20.640]  massive propaganda effort that every day brings in russia into the equation so we should as you said
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:26.560]  many times arrive with christian russia instead with the terrorists but al baghdad is also financed
[02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:33.680]  by saudi arabia and of course this is also part of the military industrial complex and
[02:40:33.680 --> 02:40:39.120]  the workers unfortunately they do behind the scenes that is limiting the efforts of trump
[02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:45.120]  that is trying to make it possible to liberate himself from the military industrial complex
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:51.440]  why ally with al qaeda and isis why ally with people that sell six-year-old girls in a sex
[02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:57.200]  slavery and kill them why why and they have a leftist pope out of the group that throws gays off
[02:40:57.200 --> 02:41:04.800]  buildings and the left doesn't care they love it they love it and people like cardinal pal and
[02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:12.000]  their pedophilia ring get a lot of their sexual slaves from these migrants that arrive into
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:18.880]  europe without any documents children that are put into slavery and under the control of priests
[02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:25.600]  of bishops of cardinals and of course they love it and they actually make even money on top of these
[02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:31.520]  migrants that is of course financed by the EU for each migrant they get a certain amount of money
[02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:37.760]  daily so each priest is each bishop who involves himself with the migrant business is sitting on
[02:41:37.760 --> 02:41:43.120]  gold making a lot of money at the same time is giving himself to deprivations and sexual
[02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:50.400]  activities with these poor slaves of the modern era who are these refugees that of course they
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:55.680]  should stay in their countries instead they come here to get and by the way you're so on target here
[02:41:55.680 --> 02:42:00.640]  in the us it was the vatican was caught five years ago with obama every family that comes in they
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:06.080]  give it to a liberal catholic family or a liberal family and they get eight thousand dollars a month
[02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:11.040]  for three people in groups of three and then and then they exploit them they make them get jobs and
[02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:15.600]  then take part of their money that's kicked back to the democrats it's slavery and i was reading
[02:42:15.600 --> 02:42:20.640]  about the same thing in europe the the the police will make people house these folks they don't even
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:25.280]  get the money but the bureaucrats actually then hold on to the welfare check that's supposedly
[02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:29.760]  going to the migrants they use them and then they grab the little girls and little boys they want
[02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:36.880]  and they disappear there's no record i mean this is just this is like vampires this is unbelievable
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:43.040]  with leo zagami look at this irish pressured to house migrants in spare bedrooms vacation homes
[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:49.760]  that's up at europe wars dot com from dan lineman that ties in with no whites allowed day second

[02:48:27.280 --> 02:48:33.280]  towards fighting evil because that's the reality of it by the way i just got some
[02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:38.960]  really shocking disturbing footage dealing with starbucks that nobody's really seen yet that we're
[02:48:38.960 --> 02:48:43.760]  going to play come up the next segment reviewer discretion advice and roger stone's going to join
[02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:49.280]  me um but we got about nine ten minutes left here with leo zagami of leo zagami dot com
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:52.960]  but all those amazing books there you got the floor of the time we have left
[02:48:52.960 --> 02:48:57.360]  this big epic battle are you thinking things are sliding towards traditionalist or just
[02:48:57.360 --> 02:49:01.440]  non-communist or non-globalist getting control of attican or it'll all come out and they're
[02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:06.880]  trying to make this cardinal pelting secret how can this how can the devil pope survive this i mean
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:16.560]  there's never been a clearer choice here well we have a situation whereby this pope has been
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:23.840]  been uh installed by the left wing mondialist to destroy the christian fate to destroy the last
[02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:30.480]  remains of the catholic fate after the second Vatican council after this pope nothing will be
[02:49:30.480 --> 02:49:38.320]  the same like we said earlier on if he resigns and like he announced makes this office like every
[02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:45.360]  like any other secular office the magic of the papacy will be will end and gradually of course
[02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:50.240]  they want to end the whole of christianity because they want to embrace a one world religion
[02:49:50.800 --> 02:49:58.080]  which is rather different and is based on a more new age sort of approach where you put together
[02:49:58.080 --> 02:50:04.560]  all these faiths and at the same time they use islam as their trojan horses we said other times
[02:50:05.360 --> 02:50:13.200]  on tuesday uh this guy who is the head of the european home affairs commissioner the mitis
[02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:21.040]  avan polpus he basically had the courage to criticize the the upcoming government which is
[02:50:21.040 --> 02:50:26.480]  trying to become a government is not even yet a government saying that italy can't change their
[02:50:26.480 --> 02:50:33.760]  migrant policies it forbid the italy from change and even the president of italy went on record
[02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:40.640]  saying you can't change this and this you can't change the migrant policies you can't change certain
[02:50:40.640 --> 02:50:48.560]  taxes basically we can't change anything italy is a country with no sovereignty and we have elected
[02:50:48.560 --> 02:50:55.120]  some people who can't even do their job so what is the point of electing them this is of course a
[02:50:55.120 --> 02:51:01.920]  dictatorship of the EU which we have to get rid of and it's becoming increasingly dangerous and
[02:51:01.920 --> 02:51:11.520]  of course is backed by the catholic church which is all the way in bed with them wow so what can the
[02:51:11.520 --> 02:51:17.360]  average person on the planet do when you've got this ridiculous anti christian pope as they make
[02:51:17.360 --> 02:51:21.680]  their global push to open the borders up to islam or they're making their move right now
[02:51:21.680 --> 02:51:25.840]  is this a rebuff of the globalist that their little precious fake pope is in trouble
[02:51:25.840 --> 02:51:33.440]  well i like the words that matthew sorbini the italian politician had the courage to
[02:51:33.440 --> 02:51:38.960]  to tell after the interference from europe they said we we don't want unacceptable
[02:51:38.960 --> 02:51:45.360]  interference by unelected officials like donald j trump said here in europe we have unelected
[02:51:45.360 --> 02:51:51.440]  people imposing their own views liberal views and nobody is actually aligning with them because
[02:51:51.440 --> 02:51:57.360]  every single election in the last few months has proven that europeans don't want these liberals to
[02:51:57.360 --> 02:52:02.880]  have control of the whole show so we really need to change things and in america we have donald
[02:52:02.880 --> 02:52:09.600]  j trump who is fighting all this and fighting also the pedophilia and the sexual trafficking
[02:52:09.600 --> 02:52:16.320]  that of course we have also seen in hollywood the recent scandals have proven once and by the way
[02:52:16.320 --> 02:52:22.480]  trump has 10 times the arrest of pedophiles rolling up hollywood sex cults i mean he's been
[02:52:22.480 --> 02:52:26.240]  delivering on this and i got this from insiders i haven't broke this yet but i'll do it now
[02:52:27.440 --> 02:52:33.200]  the whole uh analytic uh chamber's analytic i'm telling you that's all really connected to
[02:52:33.200 --> 02:52:36.960]  eric prince i've been told and they're getting ready and i was told they're getting ready to have
[02:52:36.960 --> 02:52:41.680]  the justice department go after him not not trump's justice department but obamas and that and that
[02:52:41.680 --> 02:52:47.360]  they're getting ready to go after that whole situation uh so this whole thing is just blowing up
[02:52:48.720 --> 02:52:55.840]  also the left wing here in europe is increasingly antisemitic and this is very negative i mean
[02:52:57.200 --> 02:53:03.520]  antisemitic is the most negative thing you can imagine and that's why corbin is losing in great
[02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:10.160]  britain but also here in italy we have a lot of left-wing parties that are becoming more and
[02:53:10.160 --> 02:53:16.880]  more antisemitic uh using the excuse of the latest uh problems that we had after the establishment of
[02:53:16.880 --> 02:53:22.240]  the embers in jerusalem they are increasing their criticism towards not only israel but the jewish
[02:53:22.240 --> 02:53:27.840]  people and i think this is something that we have to immediately stop but it's not counter
[02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:32.320]  the counteracted enough because the left wing politicians i was about to say what is the left
[02:53:32.320 --> 02:53:37.440]  thinking because they'll say that oh if you don't like global government it's secretly racist but
[02:53:37.440 --> 02:53:44.480]  but then you've got germany saying to jews don't wear yamakas they're telling women on you know don't
[02:53:44.480 --> 02:53:50.080]  go out wearing miniskirts at night it's just cater cater cater to the muslims this is joke level
[02:53:50.080 --> 02:53:55.120]  the left has gone completely insane but i guess they have it because it's a unified global plan
[02:53:55.120 --> 02:54:00.480]  to red carpet all these third world populations the muslims everybody where do they expect us to
[02:54:00.480 --> 02:54:04.880]  go i guess just the average liberal will say okay i won't wear a miniskirt the average jew will say
[02:54:04.880 --> 02:54:10.720]  okay i'm not gonna wear a yamaka because i don't want to uh i mean i'm in a yamaka i guess is the
[02:54:10.720 --> 02:54:14.240]  whole thing with the candles whatever the little thing they wear on their head i mean this is
[02:54:14.240 --> 02:54:20.880]  ridiculous yes sure well it is ridiculous but you have to understand that netanyahu is under
[02:54:20.880 --> 02:54:27.840]  attack by liberal forces in israel that side with rotscheid with george soros and that are ready to
[02:54:27.840 --> 02:54:37.280]  overthrow the netanyahu with when his time in his time especially his mission is gonna be
[02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:43.440]  considered concluded then they will go on to something else we have to understand that there
[02:54:43.440 --> 02:54:49.840]  is liberal forces within israel that are siding with the clinton's the obama the george soros
[02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:56.480]  and those forces are the most negative forces of Zionism not the ones that have established a state
[02:54:56.480 --> 02:55:04.160]  that in the end has guaranteed the anyway a civilization and in a way of life that is unprecedented
[02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:09.280]  in that part of the world and we have to admit that in that part of the world every other state
[02:55:09.280 --> 02:55:16.960]  is still in the hands of barbarians who are making women secondary citizens what was about to say
[02:55:16.960 --> 02:55:21.280]  is when does the left roll out the red carpet and have linda sort sir leave their events and then
[02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:25.440]  israel's this little tiny country and you read the soros documents he wants to overthrow it
[02:55:25.440 --> 02:55:31.920]  and he's got a bunch of the jews in israel actually for it i mean it's suicidal these people are crazy
[02:55:34.080 --> 02:55:39.440]  they're crazy but with the support of pope francis and with the support of the vatican they
[02:55:40.160 --> 02:55:45.680]  really getting ready for june when they will meet up in geneva with the world council of
[02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:51.280]  religions and establish the guideline for the one world religions these people are really
[02:55:51.280 --> 02:55:57.760]  following a plan and of course after that we might see finally the resignation of this post as we
[02:55:57.760 --> 02:56:03.200]  have anticipated that's a pretty global crisis just like the rockelfeller's help start world war
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:09.520]  two they admitted to start to heal in a global crisis for a global solution and you're saying
[02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:16.560]  that's what they're pushing well they're pushing towards substituting the un with a world council
[02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:24.560]  of religions that of course will then deal in a very different way that we are used nowadays
[02:56:24.560 --> 02:56:29.280]  where secular county where secular powers are dealing with each other imagine if
[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:35.920]  suddenly the people in power are all religious fanatics and each representing their own faction
[02:56:35.920 --> 02:56:40.160]  exactly so they're doing the opposite of america separation church and state they're making their
[02:56:40.160 --> 02:56:43.600]  move they know the muslims are going to be three billion people soon they can out vote they're
[02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:48.640]  going to trick us into this ecumenical ecumenical global ruling system as they've said and then
[02:56:48.640 --> 02:56:56.320]  they've got us and the Vatican is ready to change sides because they have already trained the jesuits
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:57:02.560]  to islam and they have infiltrated and collaborated with muslim leaders like fethullah gul and that's
[02:57:02.560 --> 02:57:06.720]  why godland churches and others are getting rid of the crosses and bringing the muslims in you

[03:01:41.520 --> 03:01:48.320]  like their starbucks so headline the starbucks of canada faces feces flinging woman and she comes
[03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:52.480]  in and says can i use the bathroom i don't think she looks black or hispanic so it's like a white
[03:01:52.480 --> 03:01:58.960]  lady who was that white woman thought she was black what was her name
[03:02:01.680 --> 03:02:07.680]  rachel dullesall so you've got this rachel dullesall type lady she walks in she says can
[03:02:07.680 --> 03:02:13.440]  i use your bathroom they go no one thing i like about starbucks and i never really go there is
[03:02:13.440 --> 03:02:18.960]  they do have the door locked you got to get a key so the bathroom isn't looking like someone ate you
[03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:25.680]  know 85 buckets of beef and beans and then went in there and spewed projectile diarrhea all over
[03:02:25.680 --> 03:02:32.640]  the wall and that is the thing about starbucks their bathrooms are okay this woman walks in
[03:02:33.280 --> 03:02:40.560]  to sjw virtue signal and they say no you can't use the bathroom so she squats the viewer discretion
[03:02:40.560 --> 03:02:48.720]  advised she squats she uses the bathroom and then throws it in an assault against the person behind
[03:02:48.720 --> 03:02:53.360]  the counter now the head of starbucks has said that he's going to let everybody use their bathroom
[03:02:53.360 --> 03:02:58.400]  for free well that's one more reason not to go to starbucks let me assure you so yeah this is
[03:02:58.400 --> 03:03:05.520]  looks like a white woman to me the perfect sjw crazy person who wants to virtue signal
[03:03:05.520 --> 03:03:10.080]  by squatting and crapping on the ground this is like a poll watches compared liberals to like
[03:03:10.080 --> 03:03:15.920]  toddlers throwing fits well let me tell you only the worst toddlers and of course monkeys at the zoo
[03:03:15.920 --> 03:03:21.600]  throw crap at you so we're going to roll this viewer discretion advice is documentary format
[03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:24.960]  we're going to show you the leftist right here what's obscene as we put up these people
[03:03:24.960 --> 03:03:28.560]  let's roll it right now no no no no roll it we're going to roll it right now
[03:03:30.080 --> 03:03:35.680]  so she starts yelling at them there's no audio she grabs some napkins she's not about to touch
[03:03:35.680 --> 03:03:43.760]  it herself she does this and then throws it at him ladies and gentlemen there's a white lady
[03:03:43.760 --> 03:03:49.840]  there you go and then throws it at him now there you go and that's what they want starbucks everywhere
[03:03:49.840 --> 03:03:55.760]  else to do is just let crazy people come in and and do whatever they do in your bathrooms go shoot
[03:03:55.760 --> 03:04:00.480]  heroin up i'm saying she's doing it but they do it junkies use bathrooms everybody knows that
[03:04:00.480 --> 03:04:04.560]  homeless use them and i can't tell you how many times want to swim in barton springs
[03:04:05.440 --> 03:04:09.840]  and i'd go swim a mile and it'd be seven a.m when i was done i'd walk in and try to use their
[03:04:09.840 --> 03:04:14.720]  bathroom and there'd be homeless and they're shooting up and diary everywhere and i would just
[03:04:14.720 --> 03:04:21.120]  leave and you know drive home that's what goes on that's what happens here this is the mental illness
[03:04:21.120 --> 03:04:26.320]  so this woman has just virtue signals that you know you're going to let her use the bathroom
[03:04:26.320 --> 03:04:30.320]  without buying something or she should have just said you know let me have it but no she comes in
[03:04:30.320 --> 03:04:34.400]  reportedly and says can i use the bathroom for free no she's heard about this in the news well
[03:04:34.400 --> 03:04:38.960]  she goes i'm going to virtue signal right now i'm going to take a big old dump on the ground

[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:49.760]  aired for documentary purposes so we could see what a deranged leftist looks like and i guarantee

[03:05:18.960 --> 03:05:22.960]  prescribing to their patients but it wasn't prescription but they were charging people
[03:05:22.960 --> 03:05:28.560]  a hundred two hundred dollars for the formulae and i came up with our own formula working with

[03:06:14.720 --> 03:06:26.640]  well roger stone takes over ladies and gentlemen and he's got big as in capital b i g news
[03:06:27.840 --> 03:06:33.200]  mewler is in trouble mewler is cornered mewler has been caught engaging in all sorts of crimes
[03:06:33.200 --> 03:06:37.440]  his own connections to russian oligarchs sure we told you that two years ago but now it's in the
[03:06:37.440 --> 03:06:43.280]  hill the new york times what's he gonna do what's he gonna do when reality comes for him
[03:06:43.280 --> 03:06:48.960]  and as it closes in well roger stone who mewler said weeks ago was the main focus now his main
[03:06:49.520 --> 03:06:57.520]  hope of finding a russian in the wood pile roger give us the big breaking news well alex at least
[03:06:57.520 --> 03:07:04.560]  three major news outlets have informed me that uh the special counsel robert mewler has dropped
[03:07:04.560 --> 03:07:14.160]  subpoenas on my employees my associates and uh and some of my vendors for both documents uh and
[03:07:14.160 --> 03:07:22.080]  potentially testimony before the grand jury at least one of my employees is under heavy physical
[03:07:22.080 --> 03:07:29.280]  surveillance very clearly the special counsel is now in my email reading my text messages
[03:07:29.280 --> 03:07:36.720]  monitoring my phone calls uh this is uh uh this is not an investigation this is an
[03:07:36.720 --> 03:07:44.240]  inquisition as i have said many many times i have no evidence nor knowledge of any effort
[03:07:44.240 --> 03:07:53.520]  to collude conspire or coordinate with the russian state this is a manifestation of the witch hunt
[03:07:53.520 --> 03:08:01.520]  uh all i can do alex is urge all of those people to testify honestly virtually none of them have
[03:08:01.520 --> 03:08:09.360]  any knowledge of my activities in the 2016 uh presidential campaign but this is an effort
[03:08:09.360 --> 03:08:16.880]  as you know to destroy me and to bankrupt me uh this is going to be an expensive uh brutal
[03:08:16.880 --> 03:08:23.840]  fight but i am innocent of any uh collusion with the russians and that as you know includes uh
[03:08:23.840 --> 03:08:29.280]  receiving anything from wiki leaks and passing anything on yeah they don't care they just want
[03:08:29.280 --> 03:08:34.720]  to harass your crew they just want to shut you down which in a way is a rearguard action for us
[03:08:34.720 --> 03:08:39.360]  because the public worldwide is waking up the globalism nationalism is exploding the big corrupt
[03:08:39.360 --> 03:08:45.840]  popes set to resign this deputy caught running hundreds of kidnapped children uh trumps rolling
[03:08:45.840 --> 03:08:50.240]  up the pedophile rings the country's coming back i'm kind of proud we're under attack it's not fun
[03:08:50.240 --> 03:08:56.080]  for our families or our crew but the fact that they think getting us will stop their collapse
[03:08:56.080 --> 03:09:04.560]  when i was reading this week cnn's ratings are down 30 in one month roger i mean the fact that they
[03:09:04.560 --> 03:09:11.520]  are whistling from the grave at us having a picnic in the park next door and they think you know
[03:09:11.520 --> 03:09:19.120]  uh getting in our business will make us back off we're not the little sell out minions uh you
[03:09:19.120 --> 03:09:24.480]  know that that that sing to their tune we at a cold-blooded level let's admit it roger we kind
[03:09:24.480 --> 03:09:31.440]  of like this well i'm i'm definitely ready to fight but it shows you how desperate the special
[03:09:31.440 --> 03:09:37.040]  council is to find some russian collusion he is after a year and millions of guys i know where
[03:09:37.040 --> 03:09:41.680]  he can find it i know where he can find it with his big old ugly ass head if he looks in a freaking
[03:09:41.680 --> 03:09:47.440]  mirror well he's like a big old trader to this country right there big old sack of crap right
[03:09:47.440 --> 03:09:54.800]  there named robert mewler or he could go uh and knock on the door of hillary clinton there's 153
[03:09:54.800 --> 03:10:00.160]  pardon me 145 million dollars worth of russian collusion there and the money she took from
[03:10:00.160 --> 03:10:07.040]  him he's on tar match he's in business with the very russian oligarch he claimed trap was it's
[03:10:07.040 --> 03:10:15.040]  the most made up malarkey from that goon i've ever seen well it is um look this is not fun to
[03:10:15.040 --> 03:10:21.200]  have everybody poking through your emails your text messages your phone calls it's a massive
[03:10:21.200 --> 03:10:27.520]  violation of my fourth amendment rights and my right to privacy with no probable cause because
[03:10:27.520 --> 03:10:34.720]  i am guilty of no crime uh it's an extraordinary almost kafka-esque experience because he's scared
[03:10:34.720 --> 03:10:39.280]  because he knows he's the one going to prison god i can't wait to see him in an orange jumpsuit
[03:10:40.400 --> 03:10:47.280]  well from your mouth to god's ear you look like a really like a defrock buzzard a little orange
[03:10:47.280 --> 03:10:54.080]  jumpsuit with that big old ugly you know uh acromegaly head up there all pendulous i bet he's
[03:10:54.080 --> 03:11:01.120]  gonna crap his britches and whatever he's being led into that super max prison well we all should
[03:11:01.120 --> 03:11:08.480]  pray to god that robert meuller is sent to a super max prison uh we are we are in an epic
[03:11:08.480 --> 03:11:14.560]  struggle here uh the president needs to wake up to the fact that mr meuller has uh the president
[03:11:14.560 --> 03:11:20.480]  of the united states in his sights i am just collateral damage in their attempt to destroy me
[03:11:20.480 --> 03:11:24.400]  why they're just hoping like with the whole stormy daniels thing and that ferret of the
[03:11:24.400 --> 03:11:30.080]  lawyer she has to find something and they can't so they all leak it through hillary and all the
[03:11:30.080 --> 03:11:34.560]  rest of them through through them all this made up crap these are death throws my friend
[03:11:34.560 --> 03:11:39.920]  they're hoping to find you with a crooked toenail well but let's be very clear an important part of
[03:11:39.920 --> 03:11:46.160]  their strategy is closing down our voice here at info wars they want to be sure that there's no forum
[03:11:46.160 --> 03:11:50.480]  in which i can defend myself oh yeah they don't want to respond suddenly they've you know interviews
[03:11:50.480 --> 03:11:54.400]  have dried up explain that to people and this big facebook document you sent us two days ago
[03:11:54.400 --> 03:12:01.280]  that we finally covered where they say by the 24th will be off the air very cryptic yeah it is
[03:12:01.280 --> 03:12:09.520]  extraordinary uh right now on facebook you had the ability to uh when you when you posted a paid
[03:12:09.520 --> 03:12:17.520]  promotion to reach supporters and followers of alex jones info wars prison planet and so on
[03:12:17.520 --> 03:12:24.560]  as of the 24th you can no longer reach those important targets this is a crippling for a
[03:12:24.560 --> 03:12:29.840]  number of conservative republican candidates around the country who are utilizing this service it has
[03:12:29.840 --> 03:12:37.600]  been harmful to me in my book sales for my new book stones rules uh this past year you try to sell a
[03:12:37.600 --> 03:12:45.280]  book in america you call me that's good liberals are out of shut your ass up well and then this
[03:12:45.280 --> 03:12:52.640]  past week i was scheduled uh to be on uh inderson cooper's show with uh john berman uh that cancelled
[03:12:52.640 --> 03:12:58.800]  at the last minute then i was scheduled on saturday to be on uh with mike smirkhanich to talk about
[03:12:58.800 --> 03:13:06.400]  my book that was also cancelled so i guess my performance with chris komo uh a new day my
[03:13:06.400 --> 03:13:11.920]  performance with andrew mitchell too good on msnbc were a little too good a little too good well
[03:13:11.920 --> 03:13:16.640]  let's do this your book that is amazing is available at info wars store dot com right now
[03:13:16.640 --> 03:13:20.240]  we'll ship it to you within a day get in the order it's available it's great but you're
[03:13:20.240 --> 03:13:24.560]  supporting somebody under total attack that they've demonized have lied about we've got other big
[03:13:24.560 --> 03:13:31.040]  specials at info wars store dot com and you know look all i can do is stand up to me were kissing
[03:13:31.040 --> 03:13:36.880]  his evil butt isn't gonna help us and hillary and all of them i mean they are all complete jokes
[03:13:37.440 --> 03:13:42.480]  and i just can't believe the cowardice in congress the cowardice at the justice department
[03:13:42.480 --> 03:13:46.240]  but more and more there's some good people in congress say this is a criminal conspiracy
[03:13:46.240 --> 03:13:52.480]  it's all a lie they want contempt charges on sessions uh muller all the rest of it so in the
[03:13:52.480 --> 03:13:58.720]  end of the day i know they're going to be destroyed now they may get us is hors d'oeuvres you know
[03:13:58.720 --> 03:14:02.800]  like they're driving a truck over the edge of a cliff and we're kind of a a bush at the bottom
[03:14:02.800 --> 03:14:07.680]  of the cliff but they're going to be smashed along with us in the end or kind of like a better analogy
[03:14:07.680 --> 03:14:14.800]  is what happened in moby dick you know the old allegory the old art type and you've got you've
[03:14:14.800 --> 03:14:20.880]  got uh old captain a have and his lust for war with the great white whale he may they may jump on
[03:14:20.880 --> 03:14:26.400]  our back and plunge that into our old blubber but when we take that deep dive who they're never
[03:14:26.400 --> 03:14:32.480]  going to be coming back up politically my friend so i think it's kind of like that well we shall see

[03:14:39.600 --> 03:14:46.800]  takedown of the nexium sex cult and the role i played as a source for him in the takedown of
[03:14:46.800 --> 03:14:55.360]  this egregious cult hey you have seen gregory peck in uh moby dick right where he's all wound up
[03:14:55.360 --> 03:15:00.000]  with the tackle absolutely and he's looking at well eyes looking at him and he's sitting there
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:04.240]  trying to and that well goes you know i think i'm gonna go underwater i'm gonna you're trying to

[03:15:24.320 --> 03:15:28.960]  confidence but maybe in the campaign they see us like captain ahab and they're the white whale

[03:20:42.400 --> 03:20:49.680]  between robert muller and the forces of freedom between those who would undo the results of the
[03:20:49.680 --> 03:20:56.640]  last election and those who believe in a constitutional government and the legitimacy
[03:20:56.640 --> 03:21:06.240]  of the trump presidency in any event i have noticed on q anon recently an enormous amount
[03:21:06.240 --> 03:21:17.680]  of disinformation regarding the the recently exposed sex cult nexium and a huge amount of
[03:21:17.680 --> 03:21:26.880]  disinformation regarding my uh relationship with them i served as a consultant lobbyist for them
[03:21:26.880 --> 03:21:35.920]  for two months but to clarify that situation uh joining me now is the crusading journalist

[03:22:01.840 --> 03:22:10.880]  worked briefly as a public relations man for the for the nexium self-help program which morphed into
[03:22:10.880 --> 03:22:19.360]  a an abusive sex cult exactly what happened here and tell people to clarify this what my actual
[03:22:19.360 --> 03:22:30.560]  role was well i was the publisher the publicist rather at the time that you were involved in
[03:22:30.560 --> 03:22:37.600]  fact you were just getting out of your lobbyist relationship with um nexium as i was getting
[03:22:37.600 --> 03:22:45.440]  in and i recall clearly at the time that you had quit this group that you never remember of but
[03:22:45.440 --> 03:22:53.120]  merely a consultant because you thought that there was some um untoward and possibly inappropriate
[03:22:56.080 --> 03:23:03.520]  behaviors on the part of the cult leader keith reneering so well i'm here to say unequivocally
[03:23:03.520 --> 03:23:11.760]  that you were never a member and uh you you quit up to a pretty short tenure and after i was in there
[03:23:11.760 --> 03:23:18.720]  you would call me as you recall frequently to tell me that the leader of the cult was a charlatan
[03:23:20.960 --> 03:23:27.840]  well and i urged you as you know i urged you to get out now i stress that in my brief uh uh
[03:23:27.840 --> 03:23:34.800]  uh to my brief association with this group i never saw any evidence that they were a sex
[03:23:34.800 --> 03:23:43.120]  cult or that they were abusing uh women or girls what i did sense was financial impropriety they
[03:23:43.120 --> 03:23:52.400]  appeared to be latching on to wealthy young women in many cases uh uh trust fund babies
[03:23:52.400 --> 03:23:59.680]  uh and sucking up their money this made me exceedingly uncomfortable it's the reason i quit they
[03:23:59.680 --> 03:24:07.680]  specifically wanted my assistance uh to secure the criminal indictment of a woman who had run a
[03:24:07.680 --> 03:24:14.960]  foul of the organization i explained to them that i'm not an attorney you can't purchase a criminal
[03:24:14.960 --> 03:24:22.000]  indictment they needed a lawyer to pursue that not a lobbyist they really had no understanding of
[03:24:22.000 --> 03:24:29.840]  the of the levels of government uh i also am proud to say that i was a source for you in your epic
[03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:36.160]  takedown of the cult uh and i think it's important that people not be allowed to go online uh and
[03:24:36.160 --> 03:24:43.200]  smear me as being part and parcel of something that i had no part of and never witnessed as you
[03:24:43.200 --> 03:24:52.240]  explained it to me uh the the sexual abuse comes much later that's absolutely correct roger and i
[03:24:52.240 --> 03:24:57.040]  think it's very important to put on the record for anyone that's interested in knowing the actual
[03:24:57.040 --> 03:25:03.920]  truth relative to this cult that you not only were not a member of the cult but you had a positive
[03:25:03.920 --> 03:25:15.920]  definitive role in taking this cult down i'm delighted to have that i'm delighted to have
[03:25:15.920 --> 03:25:22.000]  that on the record because many people who are detractors of either mine or info wars
[03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:28.320]  have tried to allege elsewhere otherwise i urge people who want the actual detail to go to this
[03:25:28.320 --> 03:25:35.440]  terrific article on the art voice roger stone had role in taking the nexium cult down and i was never
[03:25:35.440 --> 03:25:43.360]  a member of this cult i'm tired of the smears i'm tired of the innuendo i was first in and first
[03:25:43.360 --> 03:25:51.280]  out uh i became exceedingly uncomfortable uh but all i really saw was a substantial group of well
[03:25:51.280 --> 03:25:59.440]  healed middle-aged women taking this self-esteem course uh which i refused to take but audited one
[03:25:59.440 --> 03:26:08.720]  afternoon months much to the consternation of the cult leaders i also um was around when they lost
[03:26:08.720 --> 03:26:17.120]  millions of dollars uh in a commodities trade i think it was corn futures uh of their of their uh
[03:26:17.120 --> 03:26:24.000]  some of their financial supporters money which they then insisted was not the result of a bad
[03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:31.280]  investment by keith reneery but the result of some kind of um skull dungery on the part of the
[03:26:31.280 --> 03:26:37.440]  market uh which of course was an absurdity that one could manipulate the commodities market
[03:26:37.440 --> 03:26:43.920]  against them uh i i believe frank that there are more arrests in the offing and according to today's
[03:26:43.920 --> 03:26:51.840]  new york post um reneery and his cohorts are about to be charged additionally with human trafficking
[03:26:53.680 --> 03:27:00.960]  yeah i think that's true and i think the record should appropriately show that you were the first
[03:27:00.960 --> 03:27:10.320]  guy to say this is a crooked cult and you you were the first guy certainly for me who told me
[03:27:10.320 --> 03:27:16.960]  that reneery was a charlatan and the record shows also that i'm the one that broke the stories
[03:27:17.680 --> 03:27:22.880]  that ultimately led to their arrest so i think you deserve a great deal of credit
[03:27:22.880 --> 03:27:28.320]  for busting up this human trafficking cult you know despite the fact that it wasn't human
[03:27:28.320 --> 03:27:35.200]  trafficking as far as we know back when you were there it evolved into that and i think more people
[03:27:35.200 --> 03:27:43.120]  had heeded your voice at the time maybe some of this human trafficking might have been presented
[03:27:44.320 --> 03:27:50.080]  all right thank you very much frank prolato thanks for calling in and helping us clarify that uh i
[03:27:50.080 --> 03:27:56.400]  feel much better now because i'm tired of the disinformation that exists out there i'm roger

[03:35:33.280 --> 03:35:38.800]  things that people that have been following our campaign know is that we are a fearless conservative
[03:35:38.800 --> 03:35:43.680]  not just because of of what we're doing with the the deportation bus tour but there's been
[03:35:43.680 --> 03:35:48.240]  several other things that we have done uh we protested a teacher that kicked out two of our students
[03:35:48.240 --> 03:35:54.000]  for wearing a make a great great again shirt now we're we're out there taking a stand for
[03:35:54.000 --> 03:35:59.520]  those people that love our country love our constitution and are tired of seeing it desecrated
[03:35:59.520 --> 03:36:05.600]  and uh and invaded by illegals well i also know that you have been in the forefront of standing
[03:36:05.600 --> 03:36:12.800]  up for the national rifle association there in the state of georgia no exactly exactly whenever

[03:47:05.440 --> 03:47:23.760]  news analysis reports it's the alex jones show and now your host roger stone
[03:47:23.760 --> 03:47:35.360]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your host roger stone well sure as rain roiders
[03:47:35.360 --> 03:47:42.160]  just minutes ago broke a story regarding a social media consultant jason sullivan
[03:47:42.160 --> 03:47:50.800]  who worked for me for two months during the 2016 campaign mr sullivan received a subpoena from
[03:47:50.800 --> 03:47:58.480]  robert moeller the special counsel for both documents and for potentially an appearance
[03:47:58.480 --> 03:48:06.080]  before the grand jury i find this very curious i terminated my relationship with mr sullivan
[03:48:06.080 --> 03:48:13.680]  who's a nice enough fellow after his social media program did not achieve the results we had hoped
[03:48:13.680 --> 03:48:21.520]  for it is notable however that in his role as a vendor he had complete and total access
[03:48:21.520 --> 03:48:28.080]  to my twitter feed anything that is of interest in my twitter feed and particularly the twitter
[03:48:28.080 --> 03:48:34.640]  direct messages was turned over to the house intelligence committee months ago those looking
[03:48:34.640 --> 03:48:42.480]  for a smoking gun will not find one as i have said numerous times i had no advanced knowledge
[03:48:42.480 --> 03:48:50.160]  of the content source or the exact timing of the wiki leaks disclosures regarding the democratic
[03:48:50.160 --> 03:48:58.240]  national committee and hillary clinton this entire charade is meant to distract us from the fact
[03:48:58.240 --> 03:49:06.960]  that the deep state the obama justice department the obama fbi was involved in the fabrication
[03:49:06.960 --> 03:49:15.600]  of phony dossiers which were then used as the rationale for the wholesale unconstitutional
[03:49:15.600 --> 03:49:23.040]  surveillance of the campaign of the republican candidate for president we all also now know
[03:49:23.040 --> 03:49:33.600]  definitively based on the uh the uh testimony of uh glenn simpson of fusion gps uh and of mr
[03:49:33.600 --> 03:49:42.480]  steele that the fbi infiltrated and had a mole inside of donald trump's campaign how do we
[03:49:42.480 --> 03:49:51.600]  justify having one of our major law enforcement organizations spying on the republican candidate
[03:49:51.600 --> 03:50:00.080]  for president i can only assume that in their subpoena for mr sullivan they are seeking
[03:50:00.080 --> 03:50:08.400]  some evidence of russian collusion as i indicated earlier on the show others among my associates
[03:50:08.400 --> 03:50:16.320]  have been contacted by the special counsel's office all i can do is urge all of them to testify
[03:50:16.320 --> 03:50:26.400]  completely and truthfully there is no evidence of russian collusion coordination uh or conspiracy
[03:50:26.400 --> 03:50:34.400]  with the russian state i received nothing from wiki leaks or anyone else including the russians
[03:50:34.400 --> 03:50:42.800]  therefore i passed nothing including allegedly hacked emails uh to donald trump or the trump
[03:50:42.800 --> 03:50:51.760]  campaign this is a left wing conspiracy theory a left wing conspiracy theory that is the basis for
[03:50:51.760 --> 03:51:00.800]  two uh totally frivolous lawsuits against me one of those two lawsuits will actually be have a hearing
[03:51:00.800 --> 03:51:08.480]  tomorrow at 130 at the u.s district courthouse in washington dc where my lawyers will move
[03:51:08.480 --> 03:51:17.040]  for dismissal of this phony lawsuit uh the purpose of this lawsuit is to claim that after wiki leaks
[03:51:17.040 --> 03:51:25.120]  published the material that was allegedly hacked from the dnc that i reported on it here at info
[03:51:25.120 --> 03:51:31.920]  wars and elsewhere and therefore i have violated the privacy rights of those who were identified
[03:51:31.920 --> 03:51:39.600]  in the completely accurate material so i'm not being accused i'm not being accused of of hate
[03:51:39.600 --> 03:51:48.800]  speech or fake speech i'm being accused of speech of engaging in my first amendment rights based
[03:51:48.800 --> 03:51:56.000]  on the facts this is the kind of harassment lawsuit that you also see here at info wars where
[03:51:56.000 --> 03:52:05.040]  alice jones is being sued repeatedly uh by uh by uh the globalists and others who seek to use these
[03:52:05.040 --> 03:52:13.680]  lawsuits as a club to silence us to embarrass us to silence us through negative uh television
[03:52:13.680 --> 03:52:21.360]  and newspaper stories and then use those stories as the rationale to remove us entirely
[03:52:21.360 --> 03:52:28.880]  from the info from the uh internet don't let that happen folks that is exactly what they have in
[03:52:28.880 --> 03:52:35.520]  mind uh i urge the members of the mainstream press to cover this hearing at 1 30 tomorrow
[03:52:35.520 --> 03:52:44.000]  in room 32 a of the u.s district court building in dc where my attorneys will make the case
[03:52:44.640 --> 03:52:52.400]  for dismissal this is what we call lawfare it is an outrageous abuse of our legal system
[03:52:52.400 --> 03:52:59.120]  uh this is almost egregious as egregious as the democratic national committee lawsuit
[03:52:59.120 --> 03:53:06.800]  where donald trump the trump campaign uh donald trump jr julian assange info wars pardon me
[03:53:07.680 --> 03:53:15.360]  wiki leaks and others are being sued again in a frivolous lawsuit that claims that we worked
[03:53:15.360 --> 03:53:23.840]  with the russian state to hack the dnc and then forward that information from info wars as unprovable
[03:53:23.840 --> 03:53:32.480]  in a court of law as it is in the court of public opinion it is a left-wing conspiracy theory it is
[03:53:32.480 --> 03:53:39.840]  a crap pot version of what they think may have happened it's extraordinary that in this lawsuit
[03:53:39.840 --> 03:53:46.000]  they have no evidence or proof hoping that they will find evidence somewhere if they survive
[03:53:46.000 --> 03:53:54.720]  summary judgment in discovery that is an outrageous abuse of our legal system but i must tell you
[03:53:54.720 --> 03:54:01.280]  the cost of this for myself and my family is extraordinary i have lost clients over this
[03:54:01.280 --> 03:54:10.640]  uh and uh we face uh ultimately a monumental cost so i ask you to visit the stone defense fund dot
