[00:49.640 --> 00:54.240]  world government so they can carry out eugenics operations against the
[00:54.240 --> 00:59.120]  population killing at least 80% of us reducing our numbers through soft kill
[00:59.120 --> 01:06.640]  and hard kill weapons so that a small sub-servant class can serve the elite

[02:17.000 --> 02:21.080]  read seven and a half round of time on what's really happening over in Gaza but
[02:21.080 --> 02:25.120]  most of it's from the Israeli newspapers and mainstream news admitting that
[02:25.120 --> 02:28.520]  Israel planned this a long time ago and did break the ceasefire and then put out
[02:28.520 --> 02:34.800]  the PR stunt that Hamas broke the ceasefire when you're witnessing his
[02:34.800 --> 02:39.360]  total siege and the extermination of those people as they cut off the three
[02:39.360 --> 02:44.680]  cities in the Gaza Strip so we'll be discussing that as well with micro vero
[02:44.680 --> 02:52.000]  coming up in about 58 minutes not just Michelle Chausadowski here is some of
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.320]  the news in front of us today group Israel deliberately attacked Palestinian
[02:57.320 --> 03:02.360]  journalist Israel deliberately targeted Hamas run media installations and his
[03:02.360 --> 03:06.400]  bombing campaign on Gaza well that's what Kissinger called for a few weeks ago
[03:06.400 --> 03:15.120]  and is practicing media censorship a journalist rights group said today the
[03:15.120 --> 03:24.240]  installations in question include the Al Acosta television Al Russia I'm sorry
[03:24.240 --> 03:31.680]  if I'm reading this wrong newspaper and the SWAT Al Acosta radio which the
[03:31.680 --> 03:35.360]  Israeli Army bombed on December 8th and over the weekend respectively the
[03:35.360 --> 03:41.160]  Geneva based press emblem campaigns and a statement shining a Palestinian media
[03:41.160 --> 03:45.880]  non-governmental group the press group which fights for better protection of
[03:45.880 --> 03:49.240]  journalists and conflict zones also condemned the recent deaths of two
[03:49.240 --> 03:54.000]  journalists as a result of Israeli attacks two Palestinian journalists
[03:54.000 --> 04:01.360]  were killed one in previous attacks by Israel photographer Hamas Shahan who
[04:01.360 --> 04:05.880]  died the 26th of December 2008 another during a current military round of the
[04:05.880 --> 04:14.200]  three January Omar Salawi and it goes on the current attacks against Palestinian
[04:14.200 --> 04:17.640]  journalists remind the media community of the attacks that were committed by
[04:17.640 --> 04:23.480]  Israel against Lebanese media in July August war of 2006 the press group said
[04:23.480 --> 04:28.360]  referring to the conflict between Israel and Lebanon and their Hezbollah
[04:28.360 --> 04:34.120]  militia I remember going back over to seven eight years when they would shoot
[04:34.120 --> 04:38.200]  French British and other reporters and that was caught on video with them
[04:38.200 --> 04:42.960]  laughing about it and that's what turned a lot of European press against Israel
[04:42.960 --> 04:48.720]  was the blatant killing of hundreds of journalists as a chilling effect I didn't
[04:48.720 --> 04:55.600]  work more journalists just pour into the region didn't work for the bullies but
[04:55.600 --> 04:59.880]  the press is so controlled here that it never got on our news so our media
[04:59.880 --> 05:04.680]  doesn't know with food prices soaring to all-time highs as the dollar continues to

[06:16.720 --> 06:23.280]  the day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds
[06:23.280 --> 06:27.880]  of despotism to grow at our own door seven years after the attacks of

[06:42.160 --> 06:57.680]  oh hell it's breaking loose on 6th avenue it's now time to take the
[06:57.680 --> 07:01.880]  revolution of the next level doctors around the world claim that cancer and
[07:01.880 --> 07:05.920]  other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment but as you
[07:05.920 --> 07:10.040]  know most people are overly acidic due to stress acidic diet and lack of
[07:10.040 --> 07:14.440]  exercise pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as
[07:14.440 --> 07:18.880]  well as prevention of disease people who alkalis the water they drink experience
[07:18.880 --> 07:23.120]  normalized blood sugar mental clarity and loss of weight it was intended for
[07:23.120 --> 07:27.240]  human beings to drink alkaline water but due to modern way of life most people
[07:27.240 --> 07:30.980]  are overly acidic the fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an
[07:30.980 --> 07:34.840]  alkaline environment fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a
[07:34.840 --> 07:39.520]  regular basis and doesn't neutralize it do your part alkalis and supercharge
[07:39.520 --> 07:43.960]  your body now alcovision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt
[07:43.960 --> 07:48.680]  concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with
[07:48.680 --> 07:53.560]  only 10 drops order your bottle of alcovision plasma pH drops now by going
[07:53.560 --> 08:02.840]  directly to alka vision calm again that's alcovision calm ease the t-rex of
[08:02.840 --> 08:30.640]  political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:30.640 --> 08:37.720]  our live time stamping the date of the 6th of January 2009 man that's going to
[08:37.720 --> 08:45.080]  take some getting used to by the way later today upon info wars calm we're
[08:45.080 --> 08:50.920]  going to post a new feature I went ahead and bought a little voice recorder
[08:50.920 --> 08:55.680]  little pocket voice recorder so it's easy to carry around with me at all
[08:55.680 --> 09:01.040]  times should have bought two or three of them I'm no doubt going to end up
[09:01.040 --> 09:05.040]  losing and always lose sunglasses every five six months and cell phones every
[09:05.040 --> 09:09.680]  few months when I'm carrying a cell phone but I bought this little voice
[09:09.680 --> 09:16.920]  recorder and so many times when I'm reflective and calm late at night doing
[09:16.920 --> 09:21.760]  research one two in the morning is when I have the clearest thought process and
[09:21.760 --> 09:25.320]  when I'm the calmest or it might be driving down the highway when I listen
[09:25.320 --> 09:29.520]  to some propaganda on the radio and you know have all these hundreds of thoughts
[09:29.520 --> 09:33.280]  flashed through my mind and connections and then you know by the time I get home
[09:33.280 --> 09:38.240]  all the thoughts are lost and have basically evaporated and only a little
[09:38.240 --> 09:45.200]  remnant or artifact of it is left so last night I ended up recording I don't
[09:45.200 --> 09:54.680]  know about 30 minutes of thoughts sitting out on my front porch watching the
[09:54.680 --> 10:01.720]  rain come down and the fog roll across the hills here in Austin Texas and I
[10:01.720 --> 10:05.720]  think it was some important information that I covered and thoughts and ideas and
[10:05.720 --> 10:11.240]  so in the next few hours that is going to be posted up at info wars calm and I
[10:11.240 --> 10:17.000]  want to give prison planet TV members exclusive you know first access to most
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.920]  the media we produce so in some of them will be posted on the main site some of
[10:21.920 --> 10:28.880]  them in an indexed area all together will be posted first in the future at
[10:28.880 --> 10:33.080]  prisonplanet.tv and then of course we intend for everybody to rip it from
[10:33.080 --> 10:38.120]  there and put it out everywhere but I do want to give it to members first just
[10:38.120 --> 10:40.520]  something added we're going to do I'm also going to be starting in the next
[10:40.520 --> 10:45.680]  few weeks a little five minute news blitz where I get the most important
[10:45.680 --> 10:51.080]  stories of the day and I'm under a time constraint so I won't belabor each story
[10:51.080 --> 10:54.840]  so people that want a quick news brief I'm gonna have a little five minute
[10:54.840 --> 11:00.880]  report I'm gonna start taping generally after the show because normally even
[11:00.880 --> 11:03.920]  more news breaks then I'll have 30 minutes or so to check out what's
[11:03.920 --> 11:08.360]  happened do an analysis and then put it out looking at the legislation and other
[11:08.360 --> 11:13.440]  things that are happening we're now getting a look at Obama's policies this
[11:13.440 --> 11:22.560]  near trillion dollars that they want for quote a stimulus and it is to force
[11:22.560 --> 11:28.720]  carbon taxes on businesses to pay them to acquiesce to going along with it and
[11:28.720 --> 11:33.000]  it's to pay new enforcers for the flatulence tax for all barnyard animals
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.800]  for methane there's also a bunch of money in there for eugenics and Planned
[11:38.800 --> 11:43.320]  Parenthood operations in the third world but it's all billed as helping the
[11:43.320 --> 11:49.840]  third world so I want to go over some of that today as well Henry Kissinger
[11:49.840 --> 11:54.200]  he's done it hundreds of times but he specifically called for a new world
[11:54.200 --> 12:03.200]  order yesterday on CNBC in relation to the Middle East and what's happening in
[12:03.200 --> 12:11.080]  Gaza and he basically endorsed everything that's unfolding in Gaza took the
[12:11.080 --> 12:16.160]  Israeli side of course 110% and then said that Obama just has such a
[12:16.160 --> 12:21.920]  wonderful people such a great perception of Obama worldwide that he's gonna be
[12:21.920 --> 12:25.160]  able to really get the new world order installed and that they need to use this
[12:25.160 --> 12:31.120]  crisis to bring in a new world order and that made me remember his quote that he
[12:31.120 --> 12:39.160]  made in Evian France to the Bilderberg group where he said today America would
[12:39.160 --> 12:42.920]  be outraged of you and troops in Los Angeles restore order referring to the
[12:42.920 --> 12:46.720]  91 riots in Los Angeles tomorrow they will be grateful this is especially true
[12:46.720 --> 12:52.480]  if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond and that of
[12:52.480 --> 12:58.120]  course is al-Qaida this was Brzezinski one of his colleagues wrote the
[12:58.120 --> 13:01.920]  grand chess board they needed an outside threat whether real or promulgated this
[13:01.920 --> 13:05.840]  is this is a quote let me go back read the whole quote today America would be
[13:05.840 --> 13:10.400]  outraged of you and troops in Los Angeles restore order tomorrow they will
[13:10.400 --> 13:13.040]  be grateful this is especially true if they were told that there were an
[13:13.040 --> 13:17.800]  outside threat from beyond whether real or promulgated promulgated that means
[13:17.800 --> 13:23.920]  staged that threatened our very existence they also use fake environmentalism
[13:23.920 --> 13:29.360]  fake global warming you see another threat as Richard in Haas the club of
[13:29.360 --> 13:34.560]  Roman 91 wrote same year and was in their official public publication where
[13:34.560 --> 13:37.880]  they said we'll use fake environmentalism to control and create serfdom and
[13:37.880 --> 13:41.960]  the threat the threat of fake terror the pincer attack like a beetle grabbing a
[13:41.960 --> 13:47.760]  little juicy bug it's going to eat with its two pincers it is then that all
[13:47.760 --> 13:51.120]  peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil the one
[13:51.120 --> 13:54.520]  thing every man fears is the unknown we're presented with a scenario
[13:54.520 --> 13:57.280]  individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their
[13:57.280 --> 14:05.720]  well-being granted to them by the world government emphasis added and I know I
[14:05.720 --> 14:09.480]  just stopped and made comments let me read it all again this is an important
[14:09.480 --> 14:15.840]  quote I mean I've heard it before today America would be outraged of you and
[14:15.840 --> 14:19.360]  troops in Los Angeles restore order tomorrow they will be grateful this is
[14:19.360 --> 14:22.400]  especially true if they were told that there was an outside threat from beyond
[14:22.400 --> 14:26.400]  whether real or promulgated that threatened our very existence it is then
[14:26.400 --> 14:30.560]  that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil the one
[14:30.560 --> 14:35.040]  thing every man fears is the unknown and presented with a scenario individual
[14:35.040 --> 14:38.440]  rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being
[14:38.440 --> 14:45.840]  granted to them by the world government now that's what he said back in 91 and
[14:45.840 --> 14:53.960]  he said something similar yesterday afternoon and I appreciate listeners
[14:53.960 --> 14:59.400]  giving us a heads up on this and Kurt found the clip and on YouTube and did
[14:59.400 --> 15:06.200]  get a story out last night an excellent story that begins like this every time I
[15:06.200 --> 15:09.600]  see the aged Henry Kissinger I am reminded of the worst kind of
[15:09.600 --> 15:18.080]  pornography in fact I am reminded of a snuff film Henry Kissinger is likely
[15:18.080 --> 15:21.720]  one of the most notorious killers of the planet a monster that makes Charles
[15:21.720 --> 15:26.680]  Manson look like a silly schoolboy Manson did not actually kill anybody he had
[15:26.680 --> 15:30.240]  his brainwashed zombies engaged in the dirty work Kissinger didn't kill
[15:30.240 --> 15:36.200]  anybody either he had the Pentagon the CIA and various cutthroat clients to his
[15:36.200 --> 15:41.360]  dirty work that is to say the dirty work of the global elite Charlie had a few
[15:41.360 --> 15:46.280]  deranged girls and LSD do his bidding Henry enlisted whole armies to commit
[15:46.280 --> 15:54.080]  the crimes he engineered for his bosses and then he goes to the Cambodian
[15:54.080 --> 15:58.240]  genocide engineered by Kissinger and Brzezinski they brag about it they're
[15:58.240 --> 16:05.160]  proud of the four mill how Kissinger brags that he sabotaged the 68 Vietnam
[16:05.160 --> 16:09.320]  peace talks some of the 30,000 US troops and over a million Vietnamese could
[16:09.320 --> 16:17.400]  die that was after he sabotaged it he would get angry at newspaper reporters
[16:17.400 --> 16:24.360]  and poets in Chile and publicly bragged that it was a personal vendetta to have
[16:24.360 --> 16:28.320]  them killed and he did have them killed tortured and killed so he's a dangerous
[16:28.320 --> 16:32.960]  guy to mess with you know we go to Bullhorn Bilderberg and we go basically
[16:32.960 --> 16:37.440]  harry them and annoy them and fluster them and let them know they're not God
[16:37.440 --> 16:43.880]  I mean the last place they met in Chantilly the main meeting hall most of
[16:43.880 --> 16:48.720]  the complex was 50 60 70 100 yards depending on which area it was there
[16:48.720 --> 16:51.640]  were roads all around it it was right by the National Reconnaissance Office
[16:51.640 --> 16:57.960]  right by Defense Intelligence in a huge complex of private defense contractors
[16:57.960 --> 17:07.240]  Raytheon and Lockheed and all of them basically they're in Chantilly they're
[17:07.240 --> 17:16.640]  at the Marriott and the one spot where we were only 20 yards from the building
[17:16.640 --> 17:20.960]  was the wing sticking off the end that was the big conference room here we're
[17:20.960 --> 17:24.640]  bullhorn and guessing they're in there because we'd already been in and
[17:24.640 --> 17:29.640]  recondit days before they kicked us out and Bilderberg moved in we knew that
[17:29.640 --> 17:33.040]  was one of the biggest conference rooms and it out comes Richard and Haas
[17:33.040 --> 17:37.720]  angry looking at us and a bunch of other globalist and they'd they'd have
[17:37.720 --> 17:41.640]  world leaders pulling in and they'd play their national anthem when they'd enter
[17:41.640 --> 17:46.640]  and we know Obama snuck in there as well but I mean I know we're playing with
[17:46.640 --> 17:50.600]  fire but we have to we have to stand up against these killers we can't just go
[17:50.600 --> 17:54.840]  quietly into the night with these people but anyways Kurt did a great story just
[17:54.840 --> 17:58.160]  going through all the horrible things that he did and then giving the latest
[17:58.160 --> 18:03.320]  quote will play coming up at the bottom of the hour again the story is up on
[18:03.320 --> 18:10.040]  prismplanet.com and infowars.com Kissinger calls for a new world order it's a
[18:10.040 --> 18:13.600]  good headline but the problem is there's so many times he calls for new world
[18:13.600 --> 18:16.160]  order it's gonna get confused with other ones and maybe it should have a sub
[18:16.160 --> 18:23.560]  headline like says Obama can use Israel crisis to bring in world
[18:23.560 --> 18:27.160]  government or something like that or just to clarify that this is in this
[18:27.160 --> 18:32.240]  particular time frame but it's a great story like a line Kurt put an article a
[18:32.240 --> 18:38.480]  few days ago about Obama where he said that Obama is like a cigar shop wooden
[18:38.480 --> 18:45.240]  Indian they stick out front to attract people into the store and that and
[18:45.240 --> 18:49.160]  that's what he is he's what George Bush is they're just little frontmen that take
[18:49.160 --> 18:52.800]  all the blame with a globalist agenda they're certainly fellow travelers but
[18:52.800 --> 18:56.840]  in the final equation our minds are designed
[18:56.840 --> 19:01.080]  primitively to see the chief as really being the chief but he's not the chief
[19:01.080 --> 19:06.640]  he's a puppet our country's been captured by foreign made-off type bankers so
[19:06.640 --> 19:12.120]  we'll go over that AFP French news agency group Israel liberally attacked
[19:12.120 --> 19:15.280]  Palestinian journalists we're gonna get more into that Norwegian doctor says
[19:15.280 --> 19:19.200]  Israel intentionally targeting civilians Israel using the pletidium
[19:19.200 --> 19:26.760]  uranium against Gaza victims made-off sightings cause heads to turn in New
[19:26.760 --> 19:33.680]  York yeah he's still out and about because you steal 100 billion bucks it's not
[19:33.680 --> 19:39.000]  50 billion more than a hundred billion then you you get taken care of I mean
[19:39.000 --> 19:46.120]  he's a founder of the Nasdaq I mean this is a top banker Panetta a surprise

[20:17.240 --> 20:22.000]  you need it most unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly emits no
[20:22.000 --> 20:26.080]  fumes and produces electricity for free it's like having an electric power plant

[21:25.240 --> 21:31.040]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US I'm aware that
[21:31.040 --> 21:36.040]  some Israeli citizens have been detained in Laden's connections to the CIA the

[24:23.120 --> 24:28.720]  the still-to-long cabin made of earth and wood where lived a country bar named Johnny B. Goode
[24:28.720 --> 24:34.200]  who'd ever ever learned to read and write so well but he could play a guitar just like a ring in a bell

[24:49.320 --> 24:51.440]  welcome back thank you for joining us today
[24:51.440 --> 24:54.560]  he used to carry his guitar and a gun inside
[24:54.560 --> 24:57.000]  go sipping into trees by the railroad track
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.160]  balling and everything fit into the shade
[25:00.160 --> 25:03.080]  strumming with the rhythm that the drive was made
[25:03.080 --> 25:05.640]  The people passing by, they will stop and say,
[25:05.640 --> 25:09.920]  oh my, but that's a little country boy, cause we go, go.
[25:09.920 --> 25:13.840]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to play,
[25:13.840 --> 25:17.520]  in its entirety, the little three minute interview
[25:17.520 --> 25:20.120]  on CNBC with Henry Kissinger on the floor
[25:20.120 --> 25:24.680]  of the New York Stock Exchange as he was visiting
[25:24.680 --> 25:27.120]  the heart of the power of the New World Order,
[25:27.120 --> 25:31.040]  their fraudulent casino where they rip off the public
[25:31.040 --> 25:34.600]  that ties into their private central banks
[25:34.600 --> 25:36.120]  that engage in fractional reserve banking,
[25:36.120 --> 25:38.600]  because see right now, I mean, you really thought
[25:38.600 --> 25:41.160]  they'd let you invest in pension funds and let you retire,
[25:41.160 --> 25:43.120]  you really thought they'd let you have your 401ks,
[25:43.120 --> 25:45.760]  now they're going to steal them from you,
[25:45.760 --> 25:48.600]  because they're conquerors, they're criminals,
[25:48.600 --> 25:51.040]  they're bold, they're daring, they're wicked,
[25:51.040 --> 25:55.880]  they enjoy stealing, they enjoy hurting people.
[25:55.880 --> 25:57.840]  Oh, but a lot of folks thought that's okay
[25:57.840 --> 26:02.400]  as long as it's Iraqis or as long as it's Cambodians
[26:02.400 --> 26:05.080]  or as long as it's Chinese, oh yeah,
[26:05.080 --> 26:07.480]  they helped engineer the mass murder over there,
[26:08.800 --> 26:12.080]  as long as it's Russians or as long as it was Germans,
[26:12.080 --> 26:13.240]  as long as it was somebody else,
[26:13.240 --> 26:15.080]  as long as it was Palestinians, it's okay,
[26:15.080 --> 26:18.720]  but us Americans, we're on top of everything, no,
[26:18.720 --> 26:21.360]  you're going to be robbed and are being robbed as well,
[26:21.360 --> 26:23.200]  until you wake up and say, no,
[26:23.200 --> 26:24.520]  we have such a history of liberty,
[26:24.520 --> 26:26.960]  we have the First Amendment, the Second Amendment,
[26:26.960 --> 26:28.760]  the Fourth, the Fifth, the Tenth,
[26:28.760 --> 26:31.040]  if we simply stand up and say no to all this fraud,
[26:31.040 --> 26:34.280]  it will, it will implode,
[26:34.280 --> 26:37.920]  but if we continue to let them just masquerade around,
[26:37.920 --> 26:40.360]  stealing us blind in plain sight,
[26:40.360 --> 26:41.280]  things are only going to get worse,
[26:41.280 --> 26:43.120]  and then when Mike Rivera's on with us,
[26:43.120 --> 26:46.680]  when we go live at prisonplanet.tv in 34 minutes,
[26:46.680 --> 26:50.280]  I'm going to play the clip without audio,
[26:50.280 --> 26:55.280]  just so viewers can, on prisonplanet.tv,
[26:55.280 --> 27:00.280]  can look at the body language of the power pimps,
[27:01.560 --> 27:03.560]  the little fawning minions,
[27:03.560 --> 27:06.200]  who are just worshipfully looking at him,
[27:06.200 --> 27:08.120]  like he's the holy grail or something,
[27:08.120 --> 27:09.520]  it's just so disgusting.
[27:09.520 --> 27:11.760]  People are saying, well, how is that going to work,
[27:11.760 --> 27:13.200]  only visual for radio?
[27:13.200 --> 27:15.680]  No, I mean, I'll be pointing out to Mike,
[27:15.680 --> 27:18.640]  who'll be on his live video feed from Hawaii,
[27:18.640 --> 27:20.700]  on prisonplanet.tv, into our studio,
[27:23.080 --> 27:24.320]  you know, just asking his opinion
[27:24.320 --> 27:25.640]  about the disgusting body language,
[27:25.640 --> 27:27.120]  and if he noticed that as well,
[27:27.120 --> 27:29.080]  I mean, they're just smiling and gazing,
[27:29.080 --> 27:30.520]  and they're in awe,
[27:30.520 --> 27:33.260]  like when they have a Rockefeller or a Rothschild on TV,
[27:33.260 --> 27:36.200]  Wolf Blitzer, normally completely calm and composed,
[27:36.200 --> 27:38.480]  and focused, was just almost stammering,
[27:38.480 --> 27:39.320]  and just looking at her,
[27:39.320 --> 27:44.320]  like he was staring at Valhalla or something,
[27:45.080 --> 27:49.520]  Mrs. Rothschild, because these people are power worshipers,
[27:49.520 --> 27:50.680]  they are psychopaths,
[27:50.680 --> 27:54.660]  and psychopaths worship the bigger psychopaths above them.
[27:56.360 --> 27:59.200]  They worship the black boot, the scheme asker,
[27:59.200 --> 28:01.360]  the machine gun, when it's being used
[28:01.360 --> 28:06.360]  against screaming, begging groups of script civilians,
[28:10.120 --> 28:12.600]  covering themselves, being herded into pits,
[28:12.600 --> 28:14.880]  to be machine gunned.
[28:14.880 --> 28:16.960]  They love it, it's beautiful,
[28:16.960 --> 28:19.400]  just like an abortion's beautiful to them,
[28:19.400 --> 28:20.680]  they've set it on record,
[28:20.680 --> 28:22.160]  the power they get from it,
[28:22.160 --> 28:25.200]  the raw exercise of power,
[28:25.200 --> 28:30.200]  the bestial low level reptilian brain feeding.
[28:33.800 --> 28:36.880]  Kissinger calls for a new world order,
[28:36.880 --> 28:38.680]  so that is coming up after the break,
[28:38.680 --> 28:40.720]  and we'll analyze it,
[28:40.720 --> 28:44.360]  and then I'm gonna get into just another amazing story,
[28:44.360 --> 28:48.040]  Israeli wiretaps, the NSA in 9-11.
[28:48.040 --> 28:49.920]  Now, going back over a decade,
[28:49.920 --> 28:54.480]  I've had James Bamford on, former 2020 producer,
[28:54.480 --> 28:56.760]  nightline producer, best-selling author,
[28:57.920 --> 29:01.720]  when he wrote several books,
[29:01.720 --> 29:03.680]  number one in the late 90s about the NSA,
[29:03.680 --> 29:05.000]  and people were calling him going,
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  there's no such thing as echelon,
[29:07.000 --> 29:08.640]  now it's all admitted, of course,
[29:08.640 --> 29:11.560]  and then he also broke Operation Northwoods
[29:11.560 --> 29:12.760]  in the National Archives,
[29:12.760 --> 29:14.920]  when he had his people digging through the stacks,
[29:14.920 --> 29:16.520]  right after it was declassified,
[29:16.520 --> 29:19.800]  the plan to stage terror attacks in the US by the Pentagon.
[29:24.040 --> 29:26.000]  But there's been some new developments on this,
[29:26.000 --> 29:27.840]  the fact that it isn't even the NSA
[29:27.840 --> 29:32.080]  that runs the wiretapping, it is Israel.
[29:33.560 --> 29:36.960]  So I think it's pretty clear that there is a,
[29:36.960 --> 29:39.280]  frankly, you have to tell like it is,
[29:39.280 --> 29:41.360]  there is a serious takeover
[29:41.360 --> 29:43.960]  of all key national security infrastructure
[29:43.960 --> 29:45.400]  by the state of Israel,
[29:45.400 --> 29:46.720]  and they're definitely a big part
[29:46.720 --> 29:49.920]  of the internationalist coup against the United States.
[29:51.120 --> 29:55.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:55.000 --> 29:58.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:02.120 --> 30:03.840]  Hello, I'm Steve Shane.
[30:03.840 --> 30:06.200]  Many have been afraid they needed their food supplies
[30:06.200 --> 30:07.720]  before the election.
[30:07.720 --> 30:10.400]  The inauguration, not the election,
[30:10.400 --> 30:12.840]  is the deadline given by the Obama insiders
[30:12.840 --> 30:14.880]  for completing their foods and lives.
[30:14.880 --> 30:16.800]  Joe Biden and Colin Powell both stated
[30:16.800 --> 30:18.440]  that shortly after the inauguration,
[30:18.440 --> 30:21.240]  possibly the 21st or 22nd of January,
[30:21.240 --> 30:22.800]  the new president would be forced
[30:22.800 --> 30:24.880]  by an international incident
[30:24.880 --> 30:27.680]  to make some unpopular decisions.
[30:27.680 --> 30:29.720]  This functions as an important deadline
[30:29.720 --> 30:32.200]  for getting any food you intend to have.
[30:32.200 --> 30:34.480]  The unpopular presidential decisions
[30:34.480 --> 30:37.560]  will likely affect restriction of transportation
[30:37.560 --> 30:40.160]  and availability of food distribution.
[30:40.160 --> 30:42.560]  Order any remaining food needed no later
[30:42.560 --> 30:44.400]  than four weeks before the inauguration
[30:44.400 --> 30:45.840]  to allow for shipping.
[30:45.840 --> 30:48.200]  Late orders cannot be guaranteed delivery
[30:48.200 --> 30:50.400]  by this deadline for disaster.
[30:50.400 --> 30:55.400]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, eFoodsDirect.com.

[32:03.480 --> 32:06.080]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[32:06.080 --> 32:08.240]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[32:08.240 --> 32:09.760]  Your answer may be at hand.
[32:09.760 --> 32:11.680]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land
[32:11.680 --> 32:13.400]  isolated from civilization.
[32:13.400 --> 32:15.560]  She knows that as long as the sun shines,
[32:15.560 --> 32:18.640]  there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[32:18.640 --> 32:20.200]  Perhaps the only sane insurance
[32:20.200 --> 32:22.640]  is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[32:22.640 --> 32:24.280]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[32:24.280 --> 32:27.160]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[32:27.160 --> 32:29.240]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious
[32:29.240 --> 32:30.640]  than our modern diets.
[32:30.640 --> 32:32.160]  Well respected in her field,
[32:32.160 --> 32:34.680]  Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books,
[32:34.680 --> 32:37.080]  flashcards and video with an emphasis on health,
[32:37.080 --> 32:39.320]  safety, practicality and joy.
[32:39.320 --> 32:42.000]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it,
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.160]  how to prepare, use and store it.
[32:44.160 --> 32:46.400]  Go to Linda's website ofthefield.com

[32:54.000 --> 32:57.360]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[32:57.360 --> 32:59.720]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[32:59.720 --> 33:10.960]  There's a man going around taking names.
[33:10.960 --> 33:16.720]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[33:16.720 --> 33:21.240]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[33:21.240 --> 33:25.280]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.
[33:25.280 --> 33:32.520]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.
[33:32.520 --> 33:38.800]  When the man comes around.
[33:38.800 --> 33:43.720]  The hairs on your arm will stand up
[33:43.720 --> 33:48.880]  at the terror in each sip and in each suck.
[33:48.880 --> 33:53.760]  Will you partake of that last offered cup
[33:53.760 --> 33:59.840]  or disappear into the potter's ground?
[33:59.840 --> 34:03.120]  When the man comes around.
[34:03.120 --> 34:04.040]  Listen up.
[34:04.040 --> 34:08.520]  Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers.
[34:08.520 --> 34:13.720]  100 million angels singing.
[34:13.720 --> 34:19.960]  Multitudes are marching to the big kettle drum.
[34:19.960 --> 34:26.680]  The voice is calling, the voice is crying.
[34:26.680 --> 34:32.880]  The secular humanists say there is no God.
[34:32.880 --> 34:37.400]  But really what they're doing is setting up
[34:37.400 --> 34:41.960]  the elite, the scientific dictatorship, the wise men
[34:41.960 --> 34:43.320]  as God.
[34:43.320 --> 34:46.320]  And they say that they're going to split the species
[34:46.320 --> 34:50.800]  into the Superman and then basically exterminate us,
[34:50.800 --> 34:55.560]  the general public, the old fallen man.
[34:55.560 --> 34:56.840]  When you really study the globalist,
[34:56.840 --> 34:58.400]  you try to tell everybody to be atheistic,
[34:58.400 --> 35:00.160]  to not believe in right and wrong.
[35:00.160 --> 35:03.720]  They're only trying to neutralize your inner moral compass,
[35:03.720 --> 35:07.720]  your conscience, your soul that tells you what's right
[35:07.720 --> 35:09.800]  and what's wrong.
[35:09.800 --> 35:11.880]  So they tell you, yeah, go ahead and have 50 million abortions
[35:11.880 --> 35:12.520]  in the US.
[35:12.520 --> 35:14.320]  Yeah, go ahead and have hundreds of millions of abortions
[35:14.320 --> 35:15.720]  worldwide every year.
[35:15.720 --> 35:17.240]  Yeah, go ahead and sterilize people.
[35:17.240 --> 35:18.640]  Oh, go ahead and kill old folks.
[35:18.640 --> 35:20.160]  Their lives aren't worth anything.
[35:20.160 --> 35:23.640]  We have a bioethics board of men at the hospital who decide
[35:23.640 --> 35:27.080]  when you live and when you die.
[35:27.080 --> 35:32.280]  And they sell it all like it's a right, but then they decide.
[35:32.280 --> 35:35.040]  And then you have this public who has no moral compass.
[35:35.040 --> 35:37.560]  And they're also focused on themselves.
[35:37.560 --> 35:42.080]  They're also so into their own little pipe dreams,
[35:42.080 --> 35:44.880]  their own little delusions that they don't understand
[35:44.880 --> 35:47.560]  that when they don't care about their neighbors,
[35:47.560 --> 35:49.360]  their community, their society, when they don't care about
[35:49.360 --> 35:55.200]  themselves enough to be informed because of their selfishness.
[35:55.200 --> 35:58.160]  I've seen people who revel in not being informed and smile
[35:58.160 --> 36:00.640]  and laugh and act like they're winning because they're not
[36:00.640 --> 36:03.520]  involved and are concerned and laugh at those of us that are
[36:03.520 --> 36:06.000]  trying to know the truth and are trying to be informed.
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.080]  It takes great research and focus and discernment
[36:09.080 --> 36:12.160]  to even have any idea of what's going on.
[36:12.160 --> 36:14.360]  I can't imagine just not caring.
[36:14.360 --> 36:22.640]  There was a story in the news today about Joe Biden a few
[36:22.640 --> 36:30.640]  nights ago, tried to go and see a movie.
[36:30.640 --> 36:34.200]  And the Secret Service showed up a few months before he did.
[36:34.200 --> 36:36.200]  And there were still tickets available to the new Brad Pitt
[36:36.200 --> 36:37.440]  movie.
[36:37.440 --> 36:39.120]  And some of the time he got there with his wife
[36:39.120 --> 36:47.280]  with more Secret Service, a big entourage, it was sold out.
[36:47.280 --> 36:53.640]  But the issue is that there was a big crowd of people there
[36:53.640 --> 36:59.480]  and none of them recognized Joe Biden but the manager.
[36:59.480 --> 37:01.200]  No one cared.
[37:01.200 --> 37:04.680]  Remember the polls that they've had where over 80%
[37:04.680 --> 37:08.520]  of Americans, they have a yearly survey they do,
[37:08.520 --> 37:12.600]  don't know who Dick Cheney is.
[37:12.600 --> 37:14.600]  It isn't that they don't know who Dick Cheney is.
[37:14.600 --> 37:16.000]  It's that when they're being polled,
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.960]  they don't bother themselves to even think who Dick Cheney is.
[37:18.960 --> 37:24.440]  And so the mind, like a muscle, becomes atrophy.
[37:24.440 --> 37:27.880]  So see, they don't even know who the puppets are, much less
[37:27.880 --> 37:30.400]  who the men behind the throne are.
[37:30.400 --> 37:32.840]  So they just kind of halfway hear the news
[37:32.840 --> 37:34.240]  if they're even paying attention to it
[37:34.240 --> 37:38.360]  or they see a headline in a newspaper.
[37:38.360 --> 37:40.240]  And you can't have a society like that.
[37:40.240 --> 37:43.080]  You can't have a society where the people are asleep
[37:43.080 --> 37:43.840]  at the switch.
[37:43.840 --> 37:47.040]  You will have criminals come in and take control
[37:47.040 --> 37:48.440]  and they will take over government
[37:48.440 --> 37:51.560]  and they will use it as a mechanism, as a force,
[37:51.560 --> 37:54.520]  to expropriate everything you own.
[37:54.520 --> 37:56.600]  And not just everything you physically
[37:56.600 --> 37:59.720]  own, the capacity to generate that wealth, your liberty.
[37:59.720 --> 38:00.640]  They will destroy it.
[38:00.640 --> 38:02.400]  They understand how important it is.
[38:02.400 --> 38:05.240]  They're threatened by it.
[38:05.240 --> 38:10.080]  And you will rapidly then have no future.
[38:10.080 --> 38:12.400]  And they will then take your mind.
[38:12.400 --> 38:13.280]  They will take your soul.
[38:13.280 --> 38:16.160]  They traffic in people's souls.
[38:16.160 --> 38:17.520]  They will brainwash you.
[38:17.520 --> 38:18.640]  They will dumb you down.
[38:18.640 --> 38:20.360]  They will destroy the language.
[38:20.360 --> 38:24.840]  They will reduce our lexicon to the point
[38:24.840 --> 38:31.000]  of where we're braing farm animals.
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.480]  Obama.
[38:35.480 --> 38:36.840]  Here's the story.
[38:36.840 --> 38:41.160]  Sold out movie, Thwart's Bidens.
[38:41.160 --> 38:44.800]  OK, if it wasn't them, then who were those Secret Service
[38:44.800 --> 38:47.480]  guys?
[38:47.480 --> 38:52.880]  This is out of the Delaware News Journal.
[38:52.880 --> 38:55.640]  He's a heartbeat away from the presidency.
[38:55.640 --> 38:58.360]  But that apparently didn't help Joe Biden get a movie ticket
[38:58.360 --> 38:59.640]  Saturday night.
[38:59.640 --> 39:02.840]  Employees at the Regal Brandywine cinemas
[39:02.840 --> 39:05.400]  said the vice president elected his wife Jill,
[39:05.400 --> 39:08.040]  tried to attend a 7.45 showing of the curious case
[39:08.040 --> 39:14.840]  of Benjamin Button at the theater on Concord Pike.
[39:14.840 --> 39:20.240]  But left after they were told, the movie was sold out.
[39:20.240 --> 39:22.440]  There's been no confirmation from the Biden camp.
[39:22.440 --> 39:26.800]  But the theater employees say they were sure it was him.
[39:26.800 --> 39:31.400]  Isheera Mutmut, an associate manager,
[39:31.400 --> 39:34.120]  said she closed her box office line
[39:34.120 --> 39:37.680]  when she saw what appeared to be a Secret Service agent coming
[39:37.680 --> 39:39.480]  her way.
[39:39.480 --> 39:43.840]  This is a foreigner who has a family that were foreigners who,
[39:43.840 --> 39:45.440]  again, I'm not, these are the foreigners
[39:45.440 --> 39:46.760]  that were smarter than Americans.
[39:46.760 --> 39:48.080]  It's that they've been under tyranny.
[39:48.080 --> 39:49.200]  They're more focused.
[39:49.200 --> 39:50.560]  I've just noticed that.
[39:50.560 --> 39:52.080]  I mean, you tell somebody from Germany.
[39:52.080 --> 39:52.880]  You tell somebody from Russia.
[39:52.880 --> 39:54.080]  You tell somebody from India.
[39:54.080 --> 39:55.800]  You tell somebody from the Middle East about tyranny.
[39:55.800 --> 39:56.960]  They go, of course.
[39:56.960 --> 39:59.040]  They know all about secret police and spying
[39:59.040 --> 40:00.720]  and corruption and propaganda.
[40:00.720 --> 40:03.640]  But Americans are like, there ain't no such thing as propaganda.
[40:03.640 --> 40:06.320]  Ah!
[40:06.320 --> 40:14.280]  Again, they have no concept.
[40:14.280 --> 40:17.000]  The man asked her about tickets for the movie,
[40:17.000 --> 40:18.480]  which stars Brad Pitt, then left.
[40:18.480 --> 40:22.040]  A few minutes later, she said, the Bidens came into the lobby.
[40:22.040 --> 40:24.760]  Jill Biden walked up to speak with the manager
[40:24.760 --> 40:26.800]  while Joe stood nearby.
[40:26.800 --> 40:28.360]  She was asking me about other shows,
[40:28.360 --> 40:32.160]  but they really wanted to see Benjamin Button, he said,
[40:32.160 --> 40:34.480]  but was maybe five feet away looking at her.
[40:34.480 --> 40:36.440]  He was standing with the other Secret Service men.
[40:36.440 --> 40:38.240]  Remarkably, none of the other moviegoers
[40:38.240 --> 40:40.080]  appeared to notice.
[40:40.080 --> 40:44.120]  Employees said, nobody mobbed Biden or called his name
[40:44.120 --> 40:46.360]  or asked for an autograph.
[40:46.360 --> 40:49.880]  It didn't seem that many people recognized him,
[40:49.880 --> 40:52.080]  said employee Becky Ginrich, 21.
[40:52.080 --> 40:55.000]  Honestly, I think people were just too wrapped up in themselves
[40:55.000 --> 40:55.600]  to notice.
[40:58.920 --> 41:00.880]  Hey, let's stop right there.
[41:00.880 --> 41:02.400]  This is very important.
[41:02.400 --> 41:06.080]  You know, Biden likes that.
[41:06.080 --> 41:10.960]  He's sophisticated enough where these guys don't even enjoy
[41:10.960 --> 41:13.800]  being worshiped by throngs and crowds, the real operators.
[41:13.800 --> 41:15.120]  And Biden's definitely one of them.
[41:15.120 --> 41:19.760]  Bill Clinton's a rare breed because he's an intellectual genius,
[41:19.760 --> 41:25.280]  evil, and Machiavellian activity, but he also revels in crowds,
[41:25.280 --> 41:29.240]  that most real masterminds do not revel in crowds.
[41:29.240 --> 41:30.960]  And Joe Biden is definitely a mastermind.
[41:30.960 --> 41:34.320]  I mean, he's not a top globalist, but he's a go-between,
[41:34.320 --> 41:36.360]  he's a liaison, he's a trusted crook.
[41:36.360 --> 41:39.360]  He helped plan the 9-11 attacks, and we've covered that.
[41:39.360 --> 41:42.240]  On the Senate Intelligence Committee, meeting with Mamud Ahmed
[41:42.240 --> 41:46.040]  and others from Pakistan on 9-11, in the week before.
[41:46.040 --> 41:50.280]  But side issue, very evil.
[41:50.280 --> 41:51.480]  And they know that.
[41:51.480 --> 41:55.400]  Biden and others know that when they go out and crowds don't know
[41:55.400 --> 41:59.000]  who they are, they revel and look at how blind these people are,
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  look at how uninformed they are.
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.680]  And that's the ether in which they swim.
[42:03.680 --> 42:06.600]  And that's the ether in which they swim.
[42:06.600 --> 42:10.480]  Counting on people, not being informed, not being involved,
[42:10.480 --> 42:14.200]  not being aware of anything that's going on.
[42:17.320 --> 42:18.760]  And that's what they count on.
[42:21.640 --> 42:24.320]  So the general public has learned to have this satisfied,
[42:24.320 --> 42:25.800]  foolish grin on their face.
[42:28.560 --> 42:32.240]  And this pride of being ignorant, but it'll get you hurt.
[42:32.240 --> 42:33.240]  And it is getting hurt.
[42:33.240 --> 42:34.240]  We're going to get hurt.
[42:34.240 --> 42:36.920]  It's by design, it's engineered.
[42:36.920 --> 42:39.520]  They can talk about, will the stimulus package fix it?
[42:39.520 --> 42:41.320]  Are the auto industry, are they going to cause it?
[42:41.320 --> 42:42.440]  Was it the subprime?
[42:42.440 --> 42:43.680]  It was all contrived.
[42:47.080 --> 42:48.600]  So they're just busy confusing the public
[42:48.600 --> 42:50.360]  right now on that issue.
[42:50.360 --> 42:54.920]  But the larger point here is, employee Becky Gennrich, 21,
[42:54.920 --> 42:57.320]  said, honestly, I think people were just too wrapped up
[42:57.320 --> 42:58.320]  in themselves.
[42:58.320 --> 43:00.320]  And I think that's what they're talking about.
[43:00.320 --> 43:04.360]  Employee Becky Gennrich, 21, said, honestly, I think people
[43:04.360 --> 43:05.280]  were just too wrapped up in themselves to notice.
[43:05.280 --> 43:07.000]  What an intelligent young lady.
[43:10.200 --> 43:11.400]  Because that's what it's all about.
[43:11.400 --> 43:13.920]  They are so wrapped up in themselves,
[43:13.920 --> 43:16.280]  they'll walk right off a cliff.
[43:16.280 --> 43:17.880]  It's a mental illness.
[43:17.880 --> 43:20.880]  It's a mass psychosis.
[43:20.880 --> 43:22.160]  Well, they watch so much television,
[43:22.160 --> 43:23.760]  it literally puts you in a lower brainwave.
[43:23.760 --> 43:24.880]  It puts you in a sleep state.
[43:24.880 --> 43:26.120]  Put you in a sleep walking state.
[43:26.120 --> 43:28.680]  So they're just sleep walking around.
[43:28.680 --> 43:30.520]  I see this all the time, and it's getting worse.
[43:30.520 --> 43:31.760]  They've got studies out that people
[43:31.760 --> 43:34.800]  are more suggestible now than they were 10 years ago.
[43:34.800 --> 43:36.520]  People were more suggestible 10 years ago
[43:36.520 --> 43:37.840]  than they were 20 years ago.
[43:37.840 --> 43:39.840]  People are becoming, I mean, you can just
[43:39.840 --> 43:41.720]  do things right in front of people.
[43:41.720 --> 43:46.760]  And if you just do it in a calm way, they don't notice.
[43:46.760 --> 43:51.920]  And see, that's because just the ambient corruption
[43:51.920 --> 43:54.920]  has been turned up in the background to where now it's
[43:54.920 --> 43:57.200]  just a deafening roar, and they still don't notice it.
[43:57.200 --> 43:59.400]  Because they're deaf, psychically, mentally.
[44:02.400 --> 44:05.280]  OK, let's go ahead and play this disgusting Henry Kissinger
[44:05.280 --> 44:09.440]  clip where he calls for a new world order again.
[44:09.440 --> 44:11.280]  And then he's written many books and publications
[44:11.280 --> 44:13.680]  where he says it is a world government.
[44:13.680 --> 44:16.160]  But still, they have Republican and Democratic operatives
[44:16.160 --> 44:19.040]  write news articles about myself all the time, just this show
[44:19.040 --> 44:20.640]  alone saying, I'm insane.
[44:20.640 --> 44:22.080]  I make up stuff about world government.
[44:22.080 --> 44:22.960]  It doesn't exist.
[44:22.960 --> 44:26.320]  A new world order is just a new international agreement.
[44:26.320 --> 44:29.000]  No, as the Financial Times of London in the Wall Street
[44:29.000 --> 44:30.440]  Journal said in the last few months,
[44:30.440 --> 44:33.960]  it is world government built in stealth.
[44:33.960 --> 44:36.120]  But again, you know that, don't you, operatives?
[44:36.120 --> 44:37.280]  You think it's cute and funny.
[44:37.280 --> 44:39.680]  See, because it's not just the blind sheep that
[44:39.680 --> 44:41.560]  are mesmerizing in la-la land.
[44:46.200 --> 44:47.080]  It's not just them.
[44:49.720 --> 44:52.960]  There's another class of people that con artist criminals,
[44:52.960 --> 44:55.080]  and you get your low level ones that aren't in the system.
[44:55.080 --> 44:57.560]  And they're the ones that aren't professional enough or didn't
[44:57.560 --> 44:59.680]  have the right school, the right breaks or the connections
[44:59.680 --> 45:01.720]  to be high level psychopaths and sociopaths.
[45:01.720 --> 45:05.240]  But then you've got the high level controlled psychopaths.
[45:05.240 --> 45:08.640]  And they just love the fact that you have been mesmerized
[45:08.640 --> 45:10.480]  and think it's funny and cute to be idiots.
[45:13.360 --> 45:14.600]  Let's go ahead and play Kissinger.
[45:14.600 --> 45:15.520]  Here it is.
[45:15.520 --> 45:18.000]  Aaron, I was standing here on the floor now with former Secretary
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.520]  of State Henry Kissinger, who was here ringing the bell,
[45:20.520 --> 45:24.240]  commemorating 30 years of US-China relations, which, of course,
[45:24.240 --> 45:28.440]  were made possible by the hard work that Secretary Kissinger
[45:28.440 --> 45:30.880]  did while serving under President Nixon.
[45:30.880 --> 45:31.880]  We welcome you, sir.
[45:31.880 --> 45:33.880]  Thank you very much for being with us.
[45:33.880 --> 45:37.720]  The obvious first question is, the situation in Gaza,
[45:37.720 --> 45:41.640]  what is a scenario of the world you have worked very hard on,
[45:41.640 --> 45:44.280]  what is your view, how serious is this?
[45:47.560 --> 45:52.520]  We have to remember, Israel withdrew from Gaza unconditionally
[45:52.520 --> 45:54.720]  in 2005.
[45:54.720 --> 45:57.400]  And they are reacting to rocket attack
[45:57.400 --> 45:59.800]  that had been launched out of Gaza.
[45:59.800 --> 46:06.160]  So the problem is, can those rocket attacks be stopped?
[46:06.160 --> 46:10.720]  And then they will have to stop their military operation.
[46:10.720 --> 46:13.920]  It's a complicated situation, but it's
[46:13.920 --> 46:21.240]  one that I believe will be solved because if pieces
[46:21.240 --> 46:25.920]  do evolve in the Middle East, Israel has to take its responsibility.
[46:25.920 --> 46:28.000]  But the moderate Arab nations have
[46:28.000 --> 46:33.880]  to take responsibility for the conduct of Israel's neighbors.
[46:33.880 --> 46:36.080]  Do you believe that this is a, some people say that rocket,
[46:36.080 --> 46:39.160]  everything will stop a few days before the Obama inauguration,
[46:39.160 --> 46:41.640]  that this is all very politically motivated?
[46:41.640 --> 46:43.440]  Do you think that's true?
[46:43.440 --> 46:45.560]  I think it's a continuing process.
[46:45.560 --> 46:53.720]  The fundamental problem is, can Gaza conduct itself
[46:53.720 --> 46:57.760]  in a way that it is not a military threat to Israel?
[46:57.760 --> 47:01.400]  Then there will have to be a negotiation eventually,
[47:01.400 --> 47:06.240]  and soon between Israel and the Palestinians
[47:06.240 --> 47:08.240]  about an overall peace settlement.
[47:08.240 --> 47:10.800]  What do you think the most important thing is for Barack Obama?
[47:10.800 --> 47:13.280]  Obviously, you're here to talk about the anniversary for you
[47:13.280 --> 47:14.760]  as China diplomatic relations.
[47:14.760 --> 47:17.480]  But if you had to say, this is going to be the country
[47:17.480 --> 47:19.840]  or the conflict or the place that will find the Obama
[47:19.840 --> 47:21.080]  administration, what would it be?
[47:23.760 --> 47:26.280]  The President-elect is coming into office at the moment
[47:26.280 --> 47:29.320]  when there are upheavals in many parts of the world,
[47:29.320 --> 47:30.400]  simultaneously.
[47:30.400 --> 47:38.080]  India, Pakistan, the U.S., the she-hearted movement.
[47:38.080 --> 47:40.160]  So he can't really say that it's one problem,
[47:40.160 --> 47:42.360]  that it's the most important one.
[47:42.360 --> 47:47.640]  But he can give a new impetus to American foreign policy
[47:47.640 --> 47:50.480]  partly because the reception of him
[47:50.480 --> 47:53.160]  is so extraordinary around the world.
[47:53.160 --> 47:57.680]  I think his task will be to develop an overall strategy
[47:57.680 --> 48:01.800]  for America in this period when really a new world order
[48:01.800 --> 48:02.720]  can be created.
[48:02.720 --> 48:04.040]  It's a great opportunity.
[48:04.040 --> 48:07.560]  It isn't just a crisis.
[48:07.560 --> 48:10.760]  Are you confident about the people President-elect Obama has
[48:10.760 --> 48:12.880]  chosen to surround him because he does not
[48:12.880 --> 48:14.440]  have a great deal of experience?
[48:14.440 --> 48:19.160]  He has appointed an extraordinarily able group
[48:19.160 --> 48:22.200]  of people in both the international and financial
[48:22.200 --> 48:24.080]  field.
[48:24.080 --> 48:26.720]  Mr. Secretary, we thank you very much for your time.
[48:26.720 --> 48:28.280]  All right, so there you have it.
[48:28.280 --> 48:30.680]  There's such an extraordinary view of him worldwide.
[48:30.680 --> 48:33.240]  He's going to be able to get a lot done.
[48:33.240 --> 48:35.960]  The world has been suckered in by all this mass hype.
[48:35.960 --> 48:39.720]  And India, Pakistan, Russia, what's
[48:39.720 --> 48:44.280]  happening in Gaza, all of this part of the encirclement
[48:44.280 --> 48:47.400]  of Asia, of the Middle East, of Europe, kicking off
[48:47.400 --> 48:49.560]  global crises to bring in the new world order.
[48:49.560 --> 48:56.080]  A great opportunity, as he likes to say, a crisis.
[48:56.080 --> 48:59.080]  Remember what he said in Evian, France about today,
[48:59.080 --> 49:01.480]  America will be outraged of UN troops in her Los Angeles
[49:01.480 --> 49:02.920]  restore order.
[49:02.920 --> 49:04.040]  Tomorrow they will be grateful.
[49:04.040 --> 49:06.200]  This is especially true if there were told
[49:06.200 --> 49:09.160]  there was an outside threat from beyond whether real or
[49:09.160 --> 49:11.480]  promulgated that threatened our very existence.
[49:11.480 --> 49:13.640]  It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to
[49:13.640 --> 49:16.880]  deliver them from this evil, fake environmentalism, fake
[49:16.880 --> 49:19.080]  global warming, terrorism.
[49:19.080 --> 49:21.680]  The one thing every man fears is the unknown.
[49:21.680 --> 49:23.520]  Presented with a scenario, individual rights will be
[49:23.520 --> 49:27.080]  willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well
[49:27.080 --> 49:29.040]  being granted to them by their world government.
[49:29.040 --> 49:32.200]  And I interjected the point about using the pincer of fake
[49:32.200 --> 49:35.200]  global warming, a global crisis, for a global solution
[49:35.200 --> 49:37.080]  which is a tax to the bankers.
[49:37.080 --> 49:39.640]  Forget all the real environmental issues.
[49:39.640 --> 49:42.520]  When we come back, I want to play part of two clips.
[49:42.520 --> 49:49.480]  These are posted in a story that is up on infowars.com
[49:49.480 --> 49:54.560]  dealing with the national security agency being
[49:54.560 --> 49:58.960]  basically run by Israeli Mossad-controlled companies.
[49:58.960 --> 50:02.640]  And this is James Bamford, a former producer of Nightline
[50:02.640 --> 50:05.320]  in 2020, and has written a bunch of best-selling books on
[50:05.320 --> 50:11.480]  the NSA, and so much of the key infrastructure of this
[50:11.480 --> 50:12.520]  country is controlled by Israel.
[50:12.520 --> 50:21.120]  You know it's an Israeli company that controls the
[50:21.120 --> 50:24.280]  security for US nukes sites, nuclear weapons.
[50:24.280 --> 50:27.400]  I wonder how that Minot thing happened with the missing six
[50:27.400 --> 50:29.480]  cruise missiles.
[50:29.480 --> 50:34.240]  And Israel controls over 95% of the caller ID in the nation,
[50:34.240 --> 50:37.480]  just like IP address on internet with Google, which is
[50:37.480 --> 50:39.160]  Israeli.
[50:39.160 --> 50:42.880]  Then you have these two main companies that run the
[50:42.880 --> 50:46.360]  software that is the NSA.
[50:46.360 --> 50:50.440]  So I want to come in and play some of Bamford and then play
[50:50.440 --> 50:55.520]  another clip of some other reporters getting into this.
[50:55.520 --> 50:56.520]  Stay with us.
[50:56.520 --> 51:01.800]  It's time to get started.
[51:01.800 --> 51:03.240]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[51:03.240 --> 51:05.560]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol
[51:05.560 --> 51:08.600]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the
[51:08.600 --> 51:10.160]  symptoms are there.
[51:10.160 --> 51:12.920]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor
[51:12.920 --> 51:16.160]  circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of
[51:16.160 --> 51:18.000]  these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.520]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in
[51:21.520 --> 51:24.680]  thousands of people's lives across America.
[51:24.680 --> 51:27.240]  Blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has
[51:27.240 --> 51:28.400]  totally improved.
[51:28.400 --> 51:31.040]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm
[51:31.040 --> 51:32.840]  familiar with how much healthier I feel.
[51:32.840 --> 51:35.040]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[51:35.040 --> 51:38.280]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be
[51:38.280 --> 51:41.200]  using this product as a preventative to keep their
[51:41.200 --> 51:43.000]  cardiovascular system healthy.

[52:00.760 --> 52:03.520]  Today unlike any other in the long course of American
[52:03.520 --> 52:07.480]  history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[52:07.480 --> 52:10.160]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[52:10.160 --> 52:11.640]  But who is the enemy?
[52:11.640 --> 52:12.480]  Bin Laden.
[52:12.480 --> 52:13.480]  This is his MO.
[52:13.480 --> 52:14.800]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[52:14.800 --> 52:16.840]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[52:16.840 --> 52:20.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.720]  the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside
[52:22.720 --> 52:23.920]  the United States.
[52:23.920 --> 52:26.360]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis
[52:26.360 --> 52:30.760]  again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[52:30.760 --> 52:34.600]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[52:34.600 --> 52:37.520]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to
[52:37.520 --> 52:40.360]  the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli
[52:40.360 --> 52:42.680]  intelligence network, warnings in war games, the
[52:42.680 --> 52:44.720]  shadow government, and much, much more.

[52:53.640 --> 52:57.520]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[53:00.520 --> 53:02.760]  Did you know that it's a documented fact?
[53:02.760 --> 53:06.720]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world
[53:06.720 --> 53:09.760]  suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[53:09.760 --> 53:12.520]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of
[53:12.520 --> 53:15.280]  dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these
[53:15.280 --> 53:17.920]  parasites, and your doctor would never know it.
[53:17.920 --> 53:21.600]  In fact, clinically-detected parasites account for only 1%
[53:21.600 --> 53:24.320]  of all cases. Don't continue to suffer from pain due to
[53:24.320 --> 53:27.520]  misdiagnosis. Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy
[53:27.520 --> 53:30.280]  metal poisoning, and high cholesterol, naturally and

[53:33.880 --> 53:36.800]  known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.

[53:49.840 --> 53:54.000]  14 trace minerals. Order some today at FreshWaterOrganics.com.

[54:12.000 --> 54:15.200]  In six minutes, we'll be live with Mike Rivera,
[54:15.200 --> 54:20.000]  Samuel Casting, the radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv, with a live
[54:20.000 --> 54:23.000]  feed. For PrisonPlanet.tv members, we'll then post after the
[54:23.000 --> 54:26.000]  show, the archive. We're going to be live at PrisonPlanet.tv
[54:26.000 --> 54:29.000]  for three hours today.
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  We'll talk about the history of the Second Amendment and the
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.000]  militia, with Edwin Vieira coming up in an hour and five
[54:39.000 --> 54:42.400]  minutes, and Professor Michelle Chasidowski in the fourth
[54:42.400 --> 54:48.400]  hour today to talk about Gaza and other developments worldwide.
[54:48.400 --> 54:54.400]  Later in the show with Chasidowski, I'm going to play these
[54:54.400 --> 55:00.400]  full clips from Democracy Now. This is James Bamford talking
[55:00.400 --> 55:05.400]  about his new book, Very prestigious writer, and just
[55:05.400 --> 55:09.400]  telling you what we told you years ago that Israel intelligence
[55:09.400 --> 55:14.400]  basically runs the NSA. Here it is.
[55:14.400 --> 55:18.400]  So you have one copy of everything coming in and going to NSA's
[55:18.400 --> 55:23.400]  secret room. And in the secret room was equipment by a private
[55:23.400 --> 55:27.400]  company called Naras, the very small company hardly anybody's
[55:27.400 --> 55:32.400]  ever heard of that created the hardware and the software to
[55:32.400 --> 55:37.400]  analyze these cables and then pick out the targets NSA is
[55:37.400 --> 55:42.400]  looking for and then for the targeted communications on to
[55:42.400 --> 55:46.400]  NSA headquarters. So you have these companies, AT&T and Verizon
[55:46.400 --> 55:50.400]  that are secretly working with the NSA and tapping Americans
[55:50.400 --> 55:55.400]  phone lines. And these companies actually outsource the actual
[55:55.400 --> 55:59.400]  tapping to some little known foreign companies?
[55:59.400 --> 56:04.400]  Yeah, there's two major, or not major, they're small companies
[56:04.400 --> 56:09.400]  but they service the two major telecom companies.
[56:09.400 --> 56:14.400]  This company, Naras, which was founded in Israel and has
[56:14.400 --> 56:22.400]  large Israel connections, does basically the tapping of the
[56:22.400 --> 56:27.400]  communications on AT&T. And Verizon chose another company
[56:27.400 --> 56:32.400]  ironically also founded in Israel and largely controlled by
[56:32.400 --> 56:38.400]  and developed by people in Israel called Verant.
[56:38.400 --> 56:42.400]  So these two companies specialize in what's known as mass
[56:42.400 --> 56:47.400]  surveillance. Their literature, I read this literature from
[56:47.400 --> 56:51.400]  Verant, for example, that's supposed to only go to intelligence
[56:51.400 --> 56:56.400]  agencies and so forth. And it says we specialize in mass
[56:56.400 --> 56:59.400]  surveillance. And that's what they do. They put these mass
[56:59.400 --> 57:03.400]  surveillance equipment in these facilities. So you have AT&T,
[57:03.400 --> 57:08.400]  for example, that considers it's their job to get messages from
[57:08.400 --> 57:13.400]  one person to another, not tapping into messages. And you get
[57:13.400 --> 57:17.400]  the NSA that says we want copies of all this. So that's where
[57:17.400 --> 57:20.400]  these companies come in. These companies act as the intermediary
[57:20.400 --> 57:24.400]  basically between the telecom companies and the NSA.
[57:24.400 --> 57:27.400]  Jim Vanford, take this a step further because you say the
[57:27.400 --> 57:31.400]  founder and former CEO of one of these companies is now a fugitive
[57:31.400 --> 57:35.400]  from the United States somewhere in Africa?
[57:35.400 --> 57:42.400]  Well, you know, this is a company that the U.S. government
[57:42.400 --> 57:46.400]  is getting all its tapped information from. It's a company
[57:46.400 --> 57:53.400]  that Verizon uses as its tapping company, its eavesdropping
[57:53.400 --> 57:57.400]  company. And very little is known about these companies.
[57:57.400 --> 58:00.400]  Congress has never looked into any of this. I don't know.
[58:00.400 --> 58:03.400]  I don't think they even know that these companies...
[58:03.400 --> 58:05.400]  Okay, we're going to get more into this later in the fourth
[58:05.400 --> 58:08.400]  hour today. We can also get Mike Rivera's take on it later in
[58:08.400 --> 58:11.400]  the next hour. We're going live at prisonplanet.tv here in a few
[58:11.400 --> 58:14.400]  minutes. But look, this is only a small grouping of the Israeli
[58:14.400 --> 58:19.400]  companies who are literally above the NSA. They get all the
[58:19.400 --> 58:24.400]  data, the phone systems, computers, everything. With all the
[58:24.400 --> 58:28.400]  Israeli spies that have been busted, the NSA allows us to go
[58:28.400 --> 58:31.400]  on. This is not our government. It's controlled by foreign
[58:31.400 --> 58:35.400]  banks, period. And Israel is used as the armed guard by the
[58:35.400 --> 58:41.400]  New World Order to enforce over our own cricket government.
[58:41.400 --> 58:50.400]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:50.400 --> 58:55.400]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow
[58:55.400 --> 58:58.400]  troops, I went to ground Sierra, and we knew what to do.
[58:58.400 --> 59:00.400]  At least we thought we did.
[59:00.400 --> 59:03.400]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives
[59:03.400 --> 59:07.400]  first responders a platform to tell their story.
[59:07.400 --> 59:13.400]  Batman, EVA director on the 18th made a statement that the
[59:13.400 --> 59:16.400]  air was safe to breathe.
[59:16.400 --> 59:19.400]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave
[59:19.400 --> 59:22.400]  souls throughout the world take action against their global
[59:22.400 --> 59:25.400]  masters. He had his hand over the radio while he was getting
[59:25.400 --> 59:28.400]  a countdown. He takes his hand off, and he had three, two,
[59:28.400 --> 59:32.400]  one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[59:32.400 --> 59:36.400]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising
[59:36.400 --> 59:41.400]  at www.prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide
[59:41.400 --> 59:45.400]  or order the DVD at infowars.com. If we don't expose the
[59:45.400 --> 59:48.400]  government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[59:48.400 --> 59:53.400]  and bring in martial law.
[59:53.400 --> 1:00:05.400]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.400 --> 1:00:10.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:10.400 --> 1:00:13.400]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:00:13.400 --> 1:00:17.400]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:17.400 --> 1:00:26.400]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:31.400]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen. We are now into our number two
[1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:35.400]  of the syndicated radio broadcast, 11 to 3 p.m. Central Standard
[1:00:35.400 --> 1:00:39.400]  Time daily. The websites are infowars.com and

[1:00:53.400 --> 1:00:56.400]  large portions of the radio show live, streaming at

[1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:02.400]  for members, and then it's ripped to the four corners of the
[1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:05.400]  Google spheres, as Bush likes to call them, the
[1:01:05.400 --> 1:01:09.400]  Internets, and reaching millions and millions a week
[1:01:09.400 --> 1:01:12.400]  that way, just what we can track. So very, very exciting,
[1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:14.400]  and we thank all of you out there for your support.
[1:01:14.400 --> 1:01:18.400]  For the next 59 minutes, we're joined by Mike Rivera.
[1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:21.400]  And Mike, of course, was famous for being one of the first
[1:01:21.400 --> 1:01:24.400]  exposed events. Foster Murder had one of the first real
[1:01:24.400 --> 1:01:29.400]  muckraking websites back in the mid-1990s on the web,
[1:01:29.400 --> 1:01:32.400]  www.whatreallyhappened.com, and he's also a fellow
[1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:36.400]  Genesis communications radio talk show host here
[1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:39.400]  on the weekday evenings. And so he is with us for the
[1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:42.400]  rest of the show to talk about Gaza, to talk about
[1:01:42.400 --> 1:01:44.400]  the New World Order, that Kissinger is saying they're
[1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:46.400]  going to use the crises in Israel, the crisis with
[1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:49.400]  Russia, the crisis with India and Pakistan, which they're
[1:01:49.400 --> 1:01:52.400]  orchestrating to bring in their world government, and
[1:01:52.400 --> 1:01:55.400]  we'll talk about the economy and where he sees all this
[1:01:55.400 --> 1:01:59.400]  going. Mike, I have to say that Obama is certainly
[1:01:59.400 --> 1:02:02.400]  not disappointing those of us that knew that he was
[1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:04.400]  going to be a New World Order shill.
[1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:06.400]  Yeah, I'm afraid this has got to be one of the
[1:02:06.400 --> 1:02:09.400]  shortest political honeymoon in American history
[1:02:09.400 --> 1:02:12.400]  because we've already got, with Bill Richardson having
[1:02:12.400 --> 1:02:15.400]  to bow out, Rahm Emanuel's connections to the
[1:02:15.400 --> 1:02:18.400]  Blagojevich, excuse me, pay-for-play scandal.
[1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:22.400]  Yeah, I'm afraid that Obama is already going into
[1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:25.400]  office with some serious credibility issues, and
[1:02:25.400 --> 1:02:29.400]  again, I was a Ron Paul supporter, and I only picked
[1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:32.400]  Obama because we really weren't given much of any
[1:02:32.400 --> 1:02:36.400]  other kind of a choice, and yeah, it's a pretty ugly
[1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:39.400]  situation out there. We're seeing his new economic
[1:02:39.400 --> 1:02:42.400]  stimulus plan come forward. It's a token amount of
[1:02:42.400 --> 1:02:45.400]  help to the ordinary working class American people,
[1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:48.400]  and as usual, more and more corporate handouts to
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:50.400]  the big boys, to the big corporations.
[1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:52.400]  Well, there's also a bunch of money in there for
[1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:55.400]  United Nations eugenics operations, and even the
[1:02:55.400 --> 1:02:58.400]  Huffington Post is writing about the fact that the
[1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:01.400]  UN is forcing abortions worldwide, but meanwhile
[1:03:01.400 --> 1:03:04.400]  Pat Robertson's defending China's forced abortions,
[1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:06.400]  the liberals are against it. I mean, is the world
[1:03:06.400 --> 1:03:08.400]  upside down, Mike?
[1:03:08.400 --> 1:03:11.400]  Yeah, it very much is. It seems like people who used
[1:03:11.400 --> 1:03:14.400]  to be in favor of policy A have flipped over.
[1:03:14.400 --> 1:03:16.400]  They're now in charge of policy Z, and it goes back
[1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:19.400]  and forth. The neocons are more liberal than the
[1:03:19.400 --> 1:03:21.400]  liberals, and the liberals are actually becoming
[1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:24.400]  quite conservative in the paleoconservative point
[1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:26.400]  of view. Everybody's scrambling to find whatever
[1:03:26.400 --> 1:03:30.400]  position they can use to sell, and it really is not
[1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:33.400]  politics of principle anymore. It is really the
[1:03:33.400 --> 1:03:35.400]  politics of whatever's going to work and get the
[1:03:35.400 --> 1:03:38.400]  money and votes flowing their way.
[1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:40.400]  Mike, we're going to break here in a moment and come
[1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:43.400]  back in a long segment. Obviously, I know you want
[1:03:43.400 --> 1:03:45.400]  to get into what's happening over to the Israel right
[1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:48.400]  now. It's in the Israeli papers that they broke the
[1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:51.400]  ceasefire with Hamas, blocking off the entrance
[1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:56.400]  into Israel, the checkpoints, and killing Hamas
[1:03:56.400 --> 1:03:59.400]  leaders and targeted airstrikes. We have this
[1:03:59.400 --> 1:04:02.400]  hoax, though, in our media saying that the
[1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:06.400]  Gazans, that the Palestinians broke the truce, so I
[1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:09.400]  want to get your take on that larger operation.
[1:04:09.400 --> 1:04:11.400]  But what are some of the other areas you want to
[1:04:11.400 --> 1:04:14.400]  get into today? Well, I think you're absolutely right.
[1:04:14.400 --> 1:04:16.400]  We need to be looking at the economy because the
[1:04:16.400 --> 1:04:19.400]  economy could be one of the motivating causes to
[1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:22.400]  bring on this so-called New World Order that
[1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:25.400]  Kissinger is talking about. We already know that
[1:04:25.400 --> 1:04:29.400]  the various laws already passed to bring about a
[1:04:29.400 --> 1:04:31.400]  transition of our country into a dictatorship
[1:04:31.400 --> 1:04:36.400]  include an economic crash as a positive reason.
[1:04:36.400 --> 1:04:40.400]  All right. Mike Rivera, by the way, is our first guest
[1:04:40.400 --> 1:04:44.400]  via web feed, so you can visually see him as well.
[1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:47.400]  From Hawaii, I'm in Austin, Texas, and we're live

[1:06:00.400 --> 1:06:03.400]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American
[1:06:03.400 --> 1:06:07.400]  history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:06:07.400 --> 1:06:09.400]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[1:06:09.400 --> 1:06:13.400]  But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:06:13.400 --> 1:06:15.400]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to
[1:06:15.400 --> 1:06:18.400]  Osama Bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11
[1:06:18.400 --> 1:06:21.400]  film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[1:06:21.400 --> 1:06:23.400]  intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:06:23.400 --> 1:06:26.400]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis
[1:06:26.400 --> 1:06:30.400]  again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[1:06:30.400 --> 1:06:33.400]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been
[1:06:33.400 --> 1:06:36.400]  detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[1:06:36.400 --> 1:06:39.400]  the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian
[1:06:39.400 --> 1:06:41.400]  connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:06:41.400 --> 1:06:43.400]  warnings in war games, the shadow government,
[1:06:43.400 --> 1:06:46.400]  and much, much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD

[1:08:37.400 --> 1:08:44.400]  It is the sixth day of January 2009. Mike Rivera with us for another 52 minutes.
[1:08:44.400 --> 1:08:49.400]  Mike Rivera, investigative journalist. Again, the man that runs the great website,
[1:08:49.400 --> 1:08:54.400]  whatreallyhappened.com. He's also a fellow who works in the media.
[1:08:54.400 --> 1:08:59.400]  But we won't brag on some of the great work he does on shows like Lost.
[1:08:59.400 --> 1:09:07.400]  Let's continue. Mike, let's get first into your take on what's really happening with Israel.
[1:09:07.400 --> 1:09:13.400]  I mean, obviously, you've got Olmert who had a 32, 33% approval rating, depending on the poll.
[1:09:13.400 --> 1:09:17.400]  Now it's upwards of 60% going into elections in six months.
[1:09:17.400 --> 1:09:21.400]  We've got that stunt going. We have this old aerial Sharon plan.
[1:09:21.400 --> 1:09:27.400]  He calls it the 48 option of when they started driving the Arabs out of Palestine in 48,
[1:09:27.400 --> 1:09:31.400]  the year after Israel had driven the British out in 47.
[1:09:31.400 --> 1:09:33.400]  So, I mean, Israel's on record saying what they're doing.
[1:09:33.400 --> 1:09:37.400]  Siege to make life so untenable they can force them out.
[1:09:37.400 --> 1:09:39.400]  Do you think they're going to bring in U.S. troops?
[1:09:39.400 --> 1:09:47.400]  Will that be the unpopular move done January 21st, his first official day after swearing in on the 20th?
[1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:52.400]  Or is it all these things that Obama's doing that are going to be unpopular?
[1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:54.400]  Well, there's a lot of things that are unpopular.
[1:09:54.400 --> 1:10:02.400]  Right now, as we can see in the corporate media, the operation in Gaza has literally been dropped in importance.
[1:10:02.400 --> 1:10:03.400]  It's down to the bottom crawl.
[1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:06.400]  U.S. troops are already directly involved.
[1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:12.400]  They're standing guard at the Rafa crossing to make sure that Palestinians don't escape the slaughter.
[1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:16.400]  So, U.S. forces are already engaged, at least in that capacity.
[1:10:16.400 --> 1:10:22.400]  Plus, of course, we've got all the advisors who are over there with Israel teaching them how to use all this equipment that we're giving them.
[1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:25.400]  So, we're already kind of neck deep in this situation.
[1:10:25.400 --> 1:10:27.400]  It's not being reported all that much.
[1:10:27.400 --> 1:10:31.400]  Yes, the upcoming Israeli elections are a big part of what's going on.
[1:10:31.400 --> 1:10:36.400]  This is a bloody campaign banner that they're waving all over the place.
[1:10:36.400 --> 1:10:38.400]  And the other issue is that you're absolutely correct.
[1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:41.400]  This is about getting the Palestinians out of Gaza.
[1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:44.400]  The Israelis have coveted Gaza all along.
[1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:46.400]  It's this nice beachfront property.
[1:10:46.400 --> 1:10:48.400]  It would be worth a lot of money if it was redeveloped.
[1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:55.400]  There's all the natural gas reserves off the coast of Gaza, which Israel basically also covets.
[1:10:55.400 --> 1:11:01.400]  And, you know, the funny thing is, you talk about Ariel Sharon, back in 2005, before his stroke,
[1:11:01.400 --> 1:11:07.400]  Ariel Sharon made this kind of deal with the United States and the rest of the world.
[1:11:07.400 --> 1:11:13.400]  And that was that if we would turn a blind eye to the building of illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank,
[1:11:13.400 --> 1:11:22.400]  which is banned by the Geneva Conventions and U.N. Charter rather governing the use of occupied territories,
[1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:26.400]  if we would turn a blind eye and let them build all these illegal settlements in the West Bank,
[1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:31.400]  that they would pull out of Gaza and let the Palestinians just have their little piece of land down there.
[1:11:31.400 --> 1:11:37.400]  And I predicted back then that as soon as the settlements were completed and built in the West Bank,
[1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:44.400]  and there was no way of going back from that, that Israel would create a justification to go back in,
[1:11:44.400 --> 1:11:48.400]  reoccupy Gaza, and basically start work at building new settlements in there.
[1:11:48.400 --> 1:11:55.400]  Well, Mike, by the way, you're right, but even the Israeli papers admit these battle plans written up by the former general,
[1:11:55.400 --> 1:12:01.400]  who's now the head of Mossad, were written up in 2000 to do exactly what you're saying in Lebanon to the north
[1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:06.400]  and then down in the south on the Egyptian border with the Gaza Strip there on the Mediterranean.
[1:12:06.400 --> 1:12:14.400]  So this is so cynical to have our controlled corporate press telling us that, you know, the Gazans attacked for no reason.
[1:12:14.400 --> 1:12:18.400]  They had the border crossings blocked. They were getting bombed every week, having their leaders killed.
[1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:26.400]  The ceasefire was broken by Israel. That's all over the foreign press, the French, the British, the German, the Russian press.
[1:12:26.400 --> 1:12:32.400]  But here in the United States, you know, now with the Internet, I can watch foreign mainline feeds,
[1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:39.400]  and it's all the truth is admitted in the foreign press. Here, it's just a complete fraud.
[1:12:39.400 --> 1:12:45.400]  And even if you're for Israel and all of this, are you for the media lying to us as a people?
[1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:50.400]  I mean, that's what I'm saying to folks out there that are upset that we're reporting the facts.
[1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:56.400]  All we're reporting is what Israel says they're really doing, not the rhetoric and propaganda we're being fed.
[1:12:56.400 --> 1:13:04.400]  Yeah, absolutely. The PR war to support Israel is more intense here in the United States than it is even within Israel itself.
[1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:11.400]  I think one of the things that really pegged what we call the bovine excrement meter over here, what really happened,
[1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:22.400]  was last week when Bush is calling Hamas a governorship of Palestine and Gaza the result of a coup, and that is absolutely a lie.
[1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:30.400]  Hamas won the election. It was Fatah that staged a partially successful coup to regain control of the West Bank.
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:38.400]  And given that the Bush administration's own legitimacy is very much in question because of the 2004 and 2000 election frauds,
[1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:47.400]  it is the height of double dealing hypocrisy and deception for Bush to be saying that Hamas is in control of Gaza only because of some kind of a coup.
[1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:50.400]  And it's absolutely not true.
[1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:54.400]  Mike, continue on that point.
[1:13:54.400 --> 1:14:00.400]  Well, basically, they had an election. Everyone said, okay, Israel has pulled out of Gaza.
[1:14:00.400 --> 1:14:09.400]  It is time for the Palestinians to have an election, and they did a big show about it, and the Gazans voted for Hamas to be their government.
[1:14:09.400 --> 1:14:16.400]  And, of course, this upset Israel, which wanted Fatah to win, and it upset the United States, which wanted Fatah to win.
[1:14:16.400 --> 1:14:24.400]  And so ever since then, they have been trying to basically oust the legitimately elected government of Gaza, and that's what's going on.
[1:14:24.400 --> 1:14:31.400]  Now, everyone's talking about the ceasefire that was in place, and the interesting thing is that six months ago when the ceasefire was agreed to,
[1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:43.400]  Israel was already planning this current campaign inside Gaza that they built a model of Gaza City at an Israeli military base out in the Negev Desert to train and practice for.
[1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:52.400]  So we know all along that Israel was expecting this ceasefire to be destroyed, that it was just a fraud to give everybody some breathing room while they went out and they did their training.
[1:14:52.400 --> 1:15:04.400]  Well, and to have a propaganda statement that, oh, we tried to be peaceful, we pulled some of our settlers out, and Israeli papers are cynically admitting that this was their masterstroke propaganda.
[1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:11.400]  That's what's so insulting is that they're admitting what you're saying, that they intended to break the truce all along.
[1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:21.400]  Well, the important thing to remember is the ceasefire, it was not only just a ceasefire, but what Hamas said to Israel is, we will stop shooting rockets at you.
[1:15:21.400 --> 1:15:32.400]  If you will allow supplies and material and the things that we need to run our lives to come in through the border crossings, and Israel reneged on that deal.
[1:15:32.400 --> 1:15:42.400]  All over the last six months, they keep making it more and more difficult for people and supplies and medicine and food and construction materials and school supplies to get over the border.
[1:15:42.400 --> 1:15:51.400]  Then November 4th, right on the same day as the U.S. elections, when the American people aren't paying attention, they slam the blockade absolutely shut.
[1:15:51.400 --> 1:15:55.400]  They absolutely close off all the borders, they make it impossible for anything to get in and get out.
[1:15:55.400 --> 1:16:01.400]  They start creating this huge humanitarian disaster, no fuel can get in, so the electricity has to draw attention.
[1:16:01.400 --> 1:16:08.400]  They draw attention to the crisis, so they start shooting their tinker toy glorified estus bottle rockets at them.
[1:16:08.400 --> 1:16:21.400]  It's killed 17 people in the last few years, and that's not a good thing, but nothing compared to the thousands of dead and tens of thousands of injured in all of these different history of bombing raids and attacks that have gone on there.
[1:16:21.400 --> 1:16:30.400]  So what bargaining chip do they have? The deal's broken, and Israel acts like they gave the Gazans this land.
[1:16:30.400 --> 1:16:41.400]  That's where the Palestinians that were in Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv and other cities in the 40s and 50s were driven out in those pogroms against them.
[1:16:41.400 --> 1:16:51.400]  Markets were blown up, people were killed, neighborhoods were bombed to drive them out to the edges of Israel, and now we have a mopping up going on.
[1:16:51.400 --> 1:16:58.400]  Then the media dare claim that these are invading Muslims, invading Arabs into Israel. It's just such a hoax.
[1:16:58.400 --> 1:17:05.400]  It is, it's black, it's white, and on November 5th, one day after the blockade, Israel attacked Gaza.
[1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:10.400]  They killed six Palestinian, six Amos officials, so Israel really did break this ceasefire.
[1:17:10.400 --> 1:17:22.400]  As far as the rockets going back into Israel, they're not only ineffective, there is some reason to think that at least some of them are being fired by Israeli collaborators to give Israel this justification for going in.
[1:17:22.400 --> 1:17:24.400]  It's a repeat of Glywitz.
[1:17:24.400 --> 1:17:35.400]  Remember back on the first day of the aerial bombing campaign in Gaza, the Lebanese Border Patrol found a whole bunch of rockets just inside the Lebanon border pointing back at Israel, and they dismantled them.
[1:17:35.400 --> 1:17:47.400]  And it appears that this was an effort, again by Israel, to shoot a few rockets back into Israel, say, oh my goodness, Lebanon is attacking and restart that war as well.
[1:17:47.400 --> 1:18:05.400]  Even today, Israeli warplanes are overflying Lebanon without permission. That's an active war. They're trying to provoke Hezbollah into firing at their jets or doing anything that Israel can point to as an excuse to start a new ground war in Lebanon up to the Latani River,
[1:18:05.400 --> 1:18:09.400]  which they have been coveting for quite some time as a water resource.
[1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:12.400]  So it's this incredible fakery and hoax going on.
[1:18:12.400 --> 1:18:22.400]  We know the model of the Mossad by way of deception. Thou shalt conquer. We know that Israel has faked attacks against others under false flag again.
[1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:29.400]  And it's entirely possible that a lot of these bottle rockets that are being fired, because they're homemade, nobody really knows where they're coming from.
[1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:31.400]  It is entirely possible.
[1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:45.400]  Let's stop there. They're also trying to claim Iran is manufacturing these. Now, clearly, Iran was backing Hezbollah in the north, but there's not a big connection with Iran and this rival group, Hamas.
[1:18:45.400 --> 1:18:57.400]  But on top of that, we forget, Lenny credibility, what you're saying and many Palestinians are saying, we know that the puppet government that Israel had in Gaza was kicked out on the elections,
[1:18:57.400 --> 1:19:06.400]  and we wanted Israel to go in and we know they have massive operatives, tens of thousands that were formerly in the government and military in Gaza,
[1:19:06.400 --> 1:19:10.400]  and they are the exact type of people that could be firing those rockets back into Israel.
[1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:15.400]  So you have the motive, you have it all right there. So certainly there's a lot of evidence to that point.
[1:19:15.400 --> 1:19:24.400]  And plus Israel founded Hamas to begin with, so it could be coming from Israeli operatives within Hamas as well, not just from the Fadah.
[1:19:24.400 --> 1:19:35.400]  Yeah, it's kind of an interesting history because when Arafat and the PLO started to unite Palestine politically, do we have to break here?
[1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:36.400]  Yes, we're going to break.
[1:19:36.400 --> 1:19:37.400]  Okay.
[1:19:37.400 --> 1:19:50.400]  When we come back, let's get into that, that in the mid-70s, when the PLO was really getting a lot of credibility over there, they founded Hamas as a counterweight to it, and our source of that is the Jerusalem Post, UPI, and others.
[1:19:50.400 --> 1:19:56.400]  Israel doesn't deny that. All right, we'll come right back with Mike Rivera after this quick break. We'll continue with what's happening in Israel.
[1:19:56.400 --> 1:20:21.400]  Moving to India and Pakistan and look at the economy and take some of your phone calls.

[1:22:00.400 --> 1:22:17.400]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt, but the truth be told public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999 reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[1:22:17.400 --> 1:22:31.400]  The US economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System. In the year 2000 debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%. It's bad enough that the US citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[1:22:31.400 --> 1:22:38.400]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[1:24:15.400 --> 1:24:30.400]  Mike Rivera is our guest. Mike, let's continue as we speak to him from Hawaii. Got him up on the video feed right now at prisonplanet.tv as we sombelcast the 4-hour radio show here today.
[1:24:30.400 --> 1:24:34.400]  Continuing with the point we're trying to make as we went into the break.
[1:24:34.400 --> 1:24:47.400]  Well, basically the point is that when Yasser Arafat started to get the PLO to unify the Palestinians into a political movement to argue for their independence or their liberation,
[1:24:47.400 --> 1:24:57.400]  Shin Bet, the Israeli security force, created and secretly funded Hamas as a counterpoint to prevent the formation of a united Palestine.
[1:24:57.400 --> 1:25:06.400]  They just wanted to keep playing the two groups back and forth off of each other. Then when Arafat was assassinated, Israel basically stopped funding Hamas
[1:25:06.400 --> 1:25:12.400]  because they figured they didn't need him anymore and Hamas basically didn't want to give up the political power they had collected.
[1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:24.400]  So they started working on their own and becoming, again, what Israel most feared, a political entity able to unite the Palestinians in their quest for independence from Israel.
[1:25:24.400 --> 1:25:30.400]  Well, that which does not kill you only makes you stronger. I mean, with this type of oppression, these people don't have a choice.
[1:25:30.400 --> 1:25:36.400]  They're always going to have to fight back. And frankly, all this adversity is only going to make them more cohesive.
[1:25:36.400 --> 1:25:46.400]  Absolutely. So Israel comes up with Fatah to basically play against Hamas the way they had originally funded Hamas to play against the PLO.
[1:25:46.400 --> 1:25:56.400]  And Hamas realizes they've been double-crossed on this matter. And Israel's going to keep on playing the game. Anytime anybody is able to start pulling together the Palestinians,
[1:25:56.400 --> 1:26:02.400]  Israel will create a new fake front group with a lot more money and a lot more support.
[1:26:02.400 --> 1:26:03.400]  To state counterattacks.
[1:26:03.400 --> 1:26:11.400]  Well, to keep the Palestinians divided against each other. And as long as they're squabbling against each other, they won't unite against their oppressors.
[1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:17.400]  It's called divide and conquer. We see it here in the United States. They're rich against the poor, the men against the women, the young against the old.
[1:26:17.400 --> 1:26:25.400]  Constantly, the blacks against the white. Constantly finding these divisions and keeping the American people squabbling among themselves.
[1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:31.400]  Yeah, rather than uniting against those entities which are actually the root of all their problems.
[1:26:31.400 --> 1:26:40.400]  All right. Other points. Where do you see this going? How do you see this unfolding the siege of Gaza City and the other two cities in the strip?
[1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:44.400]  Where do you see that going? Do you see an escalation in U.S. or NATO or U.N. forces?
[1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:52.400]  We know those were openly discussed about going into southern Lebanon, but that didn't happen because of the unpopularity of Iraq and Afghanistan.
[1:26:52.400 --> 1:26:59.400]  Do you see them now getting new legs or a new lease on life like Kissinger saying, you know, the world loves Obama so much,
[1:26:59.400 --> 1:27:05.400]  we're going to be able to get a lot of our new order agenda done, as he said, at the stock exchange yesterday on CNBC.
[1:27:05.400 --> 1:27:08.400]  Where do you see this going? How do you see it unfolding?
[1:27:08.400 --> 1:27:14.400]  Well, obviously, the people who want a greater regional war are continuing to push for that.
[1:27:14.400 --> 1:27:20.400]  We saw it all over the talking heads earlier today. They're talking about how Iran is inevitably linked to what's going on in Gaza.
[1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:27.400]  They're trying to sell this as hard as they can. I think Israel is going to try and make any excuse they can to at least go back into Lebanon.
[1:27:27.400 --> 1:27:32.400]  This is going to not begin and end just with little tiny Gaza.
[1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:40.400]  This is definitely an opening to try and get a huge regional war going. There's a huge rush because of the upcoming Israeli elections.
[1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:48.400]  And of course, even though Kissinger's making that statement about new world order in Barack Obama, the consensus opinion within Israel itself is that
[1:27:48.400 --> 1:27:57.400]  Obama, as supportive as he has been for Israel, is not going to be writing the blank checks that Bush did for these wars of conquest and genocide.
[1:27:57.400 --> 1:28:02.400]  And so they want to get this thing really cranked up before Obama can come into office.
[1:28:02.400 --> 1:28:06.400]  They want to create a problem to commit the United States, regardless.
[1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:14.400]  I agree with you now. By the way, their Secretary of Defense, their former prime minister, has been on record saying this.
[1:28:14.400 --> 1:28:22.400]  He said it three days ago. He said it on Saturday. He said, we may widen this into other areas like southern Lebanon.
[1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:27.400]  So they're on record confirming what you're saying that they want a wider conflict.
[1:28:27.400 --> 1:28:31.400]  Yeah, absolutely. They do. They want to go up at least to the Latani River.
[1:28:31.400 --> 1:28:35.400]  There's always been talk about Eratz Israel. They'd love to go into Syria.
[1:28:35.400 --> 1:28:41.400]  And ultimately, of course, as we've seen over the last several years, Israel is pushing for war in Iran, just as Israel was the...
[1:28:41.400 --> 1:28:48.400]  They're claiming Iran. In fact, they have editorials in the LA Times with Israeli operatives openly saying we want to have war with Iran.
[1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:54.400]  And also, Israel's admitting they got their nose bloodied. Their aura of invincibility got shattered by Hezbollah.
[1:28:54.400 --> 1:29:00.400]  And those people sworn to fight to the death against one of the most modern militaries in the world two years ago.
[1:29:00.400 --> 1:29:12.400]  And so Israel is, again, wanting to... They've been building up, coordinating, planning to try to get this image of infallibility and invincibility back
[1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:19.400]  because they need that Borg image of resistance is futile.
[1:29:19.400 --> 1:29:25.400]  Yeah, absolutely. Israel's reputation, Israel's image is definitely on the wane here.
[1:29:25.400 --> 1:29:33.400]  And I think regardless of what happens in Gaza, the reality is Israel has lost this war in the court of public opinion.
[1:29:33.400 --> 1:29:36.400]  And it's only getting worse.
[1:29:36.400 --> 1:29:37.400]  Absolutely.

[1:31:31.400 --> 1:31:35.400]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:31:35.400 --> 1:31:49.400]  The connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government and much, much more fabled enemies.

[1:33:29.400 --> 1:33:35.400]  Got to be a joker, he just do what he please.
[1:33:35.400 --> 1:33:45.400]  All right, Mike Rivera is our guest. I want to go to your phone calls here in just a few minutes. Before we get into the economy, though, Mike, I know a news sound like you.
[1:33:45.400 --> 1:33:51.400]  You've probably seen it. It's probably up on your website, www.weberlyhubbin.com. I know it's up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[1:33:51.400 --> 1:33:59.400]  Kisses your calls for the New World Order on CNBC yesterday, and we played the clip back in the last hour.
[1:33:59.400 --> 1:34:05.400]  We're just going to roll some of the videos so people can see this demonic creature there on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
[1:34:05.400 --> 1:34:14.400]  And he, again, says we can use this crisis. Well, you mentioned earlier, so I guess you have seen it, for our New World Order.
[1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:18.400]  Again, why are they constantly admitting they're setting up a New World Order or a world government?
[1:34:18.400 --> 1:34:24.400]  Why have they had the Financial Times of London and all these papers come out and say, yes, there's a world government. Yes, it's for your own good.
[1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:32.400]  It's going to save you. While, meanwhile, the FBI training manuals and police training still tell the police it doesn't exist.
[1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:38.400]  Insane people say it exists. I've got police manuals where it says, go ahead and take somebody into jail if you find this stuff in their car,
[1:34:38.400 --> 1:34:43.400]  because they're probably a terrorist. Police chiefs support your officers if they arrest somebody for no reason.
[1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:53.400]  I mean, that's in mainline police magazines, not even the semi-classified or restricted stuff that we've gotten from police and posted on the web and covered here on the air.
[1:34:53.400 --> 1:34:59.400]  I mean, it's insane. They're openly announcing all this, but then saying we're not supposed to talk about it.
[1:34:59.400 --> 1:35:05.400]  Well, basically, it's a public relation campaign. They're trying to put the most positive face on this idea of global government,
[1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:13.400]  but at the same time, they're trying to silence those who are critical of the whole concept, and that's the reason for this double standard in behavior.
[1:35:13.400 --> 1:35:20.400]  The reason for all the positive articles, as you point out, is to convince everybody that this would really be a very, very good thing.
[1:35:20.400 --> 1:35:27.400]  That's a hard sell right now, because globalism is seen by most people as what got us into this economic mess,
[1:35:27.400 --> 1:35:35.400]  because under the old nation-state model, the United States economic problems would have been confined mostly to the United States.
[1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:42.400]  It was this whole international global trade that allowed the U.S. economic meltdown to start dragging down the rest of the world with it.
[1:35:42.400 --> 1:35:50.400]  So selling globalism as a cure for globalism is going to be a really hard sell, and this is why they're going out and they're trying to silence anybody
[1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:54.400]  who's pointing out this very obvious discrepancy.
[1:35:54.400 --> 1:36:02.400]  Well, exactly. And then, meanwhile, Greece has been deep into the IMF World Bank plan where they come in, they take over the economy,
[1:36:02.400 --> 1:36:07.400]  they hand over the roads, the power plants, the infrastructure for pennies on the dollar to foreign corporations,
[1:36:07.400 --> 1:36:14.400]  they lay off the people, their economy implodes, so the public starts peacefully demonstrating, the police shoots some folks,
[1:36:14.400 --> 1:36:21.400]  then the people start attacking the banks, the central banks, the government buildings, so the police have now been caught.
[1:36:21.400 --> 1:36:29.400]  It's on mainstream Greece television, the police admit it, dressed up like anarchists out attacking shops and cars and the general public,
[1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:36.400]  so they can say, oh, look, the protesters are attacking the Greek people to try to fool the public into joining with the establishment,
[1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:39.400]  but they're playing a 10, 20, 30-year-old game.
[1:36:39.400 --> 1:36:44.400]  They're now being caught when they tried last year in Ottawa during the North American Union Summit.
[1:36:44.400 --> 1:36:48.400]  The police attacked police, dressed up like anarchists, turns out they got caught.
[1:36:48.400 --> 1:36:56.400]  That was in the major papers. Denver Post a few months ago admitted that in Denver, the police attacked police in front of the news cameras
[1:36:56.400 --> 1:37:01.400]  in a staged event, dressed up like protesters, so they could attack the peaceful crowds on the opening day.
[1:37:01.400 --> 1:37:11.400]  All of this, all of this going on and happening, and so they're having to stage these events as globalism begins to collapse,
[1:37:11.400 --> 1:37:17.400]  and now they want to bring in their iron fist of police state, not just in Greece, but in Europe and the United States and England.
[1:37:17.400 --> 1:37:21.400]  It isn't going to work. I mean, people know they're the bad guys.
[1:37:21.400 --> 1:37:26.400]  Yeah, it really is. It's a very different world because of the alternative media, because of the internet, especially.
[1:37:26.400 --> 1:37:35.400]  The tricks that worked 30, 40, 50 years ago don't work any longer, and unfortunately the people in charge of these projects,
[1:37:35.400 --> 1:37:46.400]  there are a bunch of Cold War fossils who just don't get it that the fundamental nature of information flow in our society has changed drastically, dramatically.
[1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:52.400]  It is as great a change as that which accompanied Gutenberg's invention of movable type printing.
[1:37:52.400 --> 1:37:59.400]  And if you look at the history of the social upheaval that followed the availability of cheap books and cheap printing,
[1:37:59.400 --> 1:38:06.400]  it really is, it sets a lot of patterns for what we're seeing now, where the old established order wants to go back to the world
[1:38:06.400 --> 1:38:11.400]  where they had this incredible control over what you saw and what you thought, what you read.
[1:38:11.400 --> 1:38:18.400]  I mean, we're literally seeing, they're trying to go back to the days of the Cold War with Russia, and they're not getting any traction with it.
[1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:27.400]  Absolutely. Let's get into the economy briefly and where you see that going and a little bit about Obama's plan for the economy,
[1:38:27.400 --> 1:38:32.400]  which again is a bunch of corporate payoffs, a trillion bucks to basically buy off.
[1:38:32.400 --> 1:38:38.400]  They've already given the banks their 8.5 trillion in counting. We haven't gotten new numbers in three months in three weeks.
[1:38:38.400 --> 1:38:44.400]  But in the first couple months of the bailout, it was 8.5 trillion according to the AP Bloomberg and other publications.
[1:38:44.400 --> 1:38:48.400]  And then we have the private Federal Reserve telling Congress we're not going to tell you what's going on.
[1:38:48.400 --> 1:38:53.400]  And then a board of governors, a member of the Federal Reserve says we're not even allowed to know what's happening.
[1:38:53.400 --> 1:38:59.400]  Only the Fed in New York and the Treasury are doing this, and we've been told the War Powers Act has been implemented.
[1:38:59.400 --> 1:39:04.400]  And then that's in Bloomberg and AP. I mean, we're under financial receivership dictatorship,
[1:39:04.400 --> 1:39:10.400]  but if we're able to expose that, it can't stand because it's so criminal on the face of it.
[1:39:10.400 --> 1:39:15.400]  So how do we break the trance? The public's partially awake right now, but how do we break the trance
[1:39:15.400 --> 1:39:19.400]  and let them realize the magnitude of what's really happening?
[1:39:19.400 --> 1:39:26.400]  Well, I think it's kind of automatic because we're looking at probably 11% unemployment in the next couple of months.
[1:39:26.400 --> 1:39:32.400]  We're probably looking at 20 to 25% unemployment by the middle of 2009, and that's a depression level.
[1:39:32.400 --> 1:39:36.400]  And the government is grudgingly admitting we're in a recession, but I think most Americans are aware.
[1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:43.400]  We're in a serious, serious trouble, and we're seeing situations where Bernie Madoff has just underscored
[1:39:43.400 --> 1:39:50.400]  the fact that a lot of the game-playing we've been seeing in Wall Street was very unproductive, gambling, casino,
[1:39:50.400 --> 1:39:56.400]  get-rich-quick-scamming, and the losses for it all are being dumped on the American taxpayer.
[1:39:56.400 --> 1:40:00.400]  I mean, they've already caught Bernie Madoff violating the terms of his bail.
[1:40:00.400 --> 1:40:05.400]  His wife and he have been mailing their personal jewelry, about a million dollars worth.
[1:40:05.400 --> 1:40:08.400]  And he's still out on the street every day.
[1:40:08.400 --> 1:40:10.400]  And he's still on the street. The judge would not put him in jail.
[1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:17.400]  I think they want him to leave the country because what we're hearing from other sources is that a full investigation
[1:40:17.400 --> 1:40:23.400]  into his little scam is going to reveal that most of these other Wall Street investment groups were also running pawns.
[1:40:23.400 --> 1:40:29.400]  Well, that's already admitted. I mean, every major bank in the world had investments with him.
[1:40:29.400 --> 1:40:35.400]  They were more like a hundred billion, and they knew fully, and people were telling the Securities and Exchange Commission
[1:40:35.400 --> 1:40:39.400]  back in 1999, 1998, that this was a fraud, and of course they didn't investigate.
[1:40:39.400 --> 1:40:43.400]  The FBI will go set you up if you don't pay 10 grand in taxes to the IRS.
[1:40:43.400 --> 1:40:46.400]  You write your checks, by the way, of the Bernie Madoff Federal Reserve.
[1:40:46.400 --> 1:40:50.400]  But if this guy steals a hundred million bucks, there's no problem.
[1:40:50.400 --> 1:40:55.400]  Yeah, because the people at the top were all neck deep in it.
[1:40:55.400 --> 1:41:03.400]  They don't want you to know where that hundred billion went, so what they're going to do is they're going to pay off the losses again
[1:41:03.400 --> 1:41:06.400]  with a taxpayer-funded bailout.
[1:41:06.400 --> 1:41:10.400]  But that's the real danger. That's the real danger is that these guys are cornered.
[1:41:10.400 --> 1:41:13.400]  They're going for broke. They control through fraud, the world's central banks.
[1:41:13.400 --> 1:41:16.400]  They bought up most of the economy through fraud. They've debased the currency.
[1:41:16.400 --> 1:41:23.400]  They've moved into the real assets, and they're leaving a rear-guard police state here,
[1:41:23.400 --> 1:41:25.400]  and it's accelerating globalism.
[1:41:25.400 --> 1:41:28.400]  I mean, I talked to people that work at IBM. They've already had massive layoffs.
[1:41:28.400 --> 1:41:32.400]  They're now literally telling everybody, okay, you're only part-time trainers now.
[1:41:32.400 --> 1:41:35.400]  Here are all your end-in replacements.
[1:41:35.400 --> 1:41:39.400]  They were making seven bucks an hour, and you're all going to be fired in a few months.
[1:41:39.400 --> 1:41:41.400]  So you can take it or leave it.
[1:41:41.400 --> 1:41:44.400]  I mean, I don't think the public realizes that through this crisis,
[1:41:44.400 --> 1:41:47.400]  the race to the bottom is now going to be accelerated,
[1:41:47.400 --> 1:41:52.400]  and that this collapse will actually centralize more power in the hands of fewer people.
[1:41:52.400 --> 1:41:57.400]  Well, you know, I think what the American people need to realize is that all of this debt
[1:41:57.400 --> 1:42:01.400]  that they are in was manufactured with counterfeit printed-up money.
[1:42:01.400 --> 1:42:06.400]  I mean, the house that you're living in today is exactly the same house it was 20, 30 years ago,
[1:42:06.400 --> 1:42:11.400]  but somehow because of all this extra money that was printed up out of thin air by the Federal Reserve,
[1:42:11.400 --> 1:42:16.400]  its value and the debt that you owe on it is now much, much, much greater.
[1:42:16.400 --> 1:42:20.400]  And this is over and above the fact that over the course of a 30-year mortgage,
[1:42:20.400 --> 1:42:24.400]  you're going to pay the banks five times what the house actually costs
[1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:26.400]  by the time you add up all the interest payments.
[1:42:26.400 --> 1:42:30.400]  So we are, as a nation, we have lost our way.
[1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:33.400]  We have wandered away from the making of products to make money,
[1:42:33.400 --> 1:42:36.400]  and we made money, the product itself,
[1:42:36.400 --> 1:42:42.400]  and the things that are used to create wealth like houses, cars, TV sets, automobiles,
[1:42:42.400 --> 1:42:46.400]  all these things we used to make, it's trivialized, it's marginalized.
[1:42:46.400 --> 1:42:50.400]  Our whole economy is based... Yeah, we've got the fiat economy eating the real economy,
[1:42:50.400 --> 1:42:54.400]  and then they've taken the fiat money when it still had value and bought everything up.
[1:42:54.400 --> 1:42:57.400]  Now, we're left to not just have an economy,
[1:42:57.400 --> 1:43:02.400]  but to owe this fiat money to the very bankers that stole it from us.
[1:43:02.400 --> 1:43:05.400]  I mean, folks, this is just indescribable.
[1:43:05.400 --> 1:43:08.400]  Mike, I've studied history, I've studied the history of financing,
[1:43:08.400 --> 1:43:11.400]  and there have been similar things done on a smaller scale in third-world countries
[1:43:11.400 --> 1:43:14.400]  by the very same gaggle of money changers,
[1:43:14.400 --> 1:43:20.400]  but I've never seen anything even approaching in the arrogance, the openness, the wild-eyedness.
[1:43:20.400 --> 1:43:22.400]  Again, they're going for broke.
[1:43:22.400 --> 1:43:29.400]  They absolutely are, and I think what we're seeing here is the looting of the nation
[1:43:29.400 --> 1:43:33.400]  prior to its ultimate collapse, and everybody's out to make a fast buck
[1:43:33.400 --> 1:43:36.400]  and fill their own pockets and get the money offshore.
[1:43:36.400 --> 1:43:40.400]  And again, that wild, wild, wildcatting at the end as it's imploding
[1:43:40.400 --> 1:43:43.400]  makes them even be more aggressive.
[1:43:43.400 --> 1:43:48.400]  Absolutely, because they're realizing that the normal mechanisms of law enforcement,
[1:43:48.400 --> 1:43:50.400]  it's like what they're doing with Bernie Madoff,
[1:43:50.400 --> 1:43:53.400]  $50 billion and he's still allowed to stay at home.
[1:43:53.400 --> 1:43:54.400]  The message has gone out,
[1:43:54.400 --> 1:43:57.400]  loot the nation at will, nothing will happen to you.
[1:43:57.400 --> 1:44:00.400]  And so it's open season on the American taxpayer.
[1:44:00.400 --> 1:44:02.400]  And again, they said three weeks ago, at least $50 billion,
[1:44:02.400 --> 1:44:06.400]  now they're saying, oh, it's much higher, it could be more than $100 billion.
[1:44:06.400 --> 1:44:08.400]  They still don't know where it all leads.
[1:44:08.400 --> 1:44:11.400]  There are still people walking around who think their money was safe
[1:44:11.400 --> 1:44:13.400]  in federally regulated banks,
[1:44:13.400 --> 1:44:17.400]  not knowing those federally regulated banks were putting their money
[1:44:17.400 --> 1:44:19.400]  into Bernie Madoff's pyramid scheme.
[1:44:19.400 --> 1:44:21.400]  Well, you hinted at this.
[1:44:21.400 --> 1:44:22.400]  You hinted at this.
[1:44:22.400 --> 1:44:24.400]  Yeah, knowing it was a Ponzi scheme, but they were insiders,
[1:44:24.400 --> 1:44:26.400]  so they'd be protected.
[1:44:26.400 --> 1:44:28.400]  And that's that, look, his son's this company,
[1:44:28.400 --> 1:44:32.400]  this guy wasn't running hundreds of billions of dollars of investment
[1:44:32.400 --> 1:44:35.400]  over the years, 50 to whatever, you know,
[1:44:35.400 --> 1:44:38.400]  $100 billion at the end of the musical chairs,
[1:44:38.400 --> 1:44:42.400]  the folks that didn't get chairs, but hundreds of billions over the decades,
[1:44:42.400 --> 1:44:46.400]  founder of the NASDAQ, formerly its chairman.
[1:44:46.400 --> 1:44:50.400]  I mean, he's really taking the fall right now claiming he created
[1:44:50.400 --> 1:44:52.400]  all the fake computer databases.
[1:44:52.400 --> 1:44:54.400]  He sent out all the fake forms.
[1:44:54.400 --> 1:44:57.400]  He filed all the fake forms with the government.
[1:44:57.400 --> 1:44:59.400]  I mean, that's absolute bull.
[1:44:59.400 --> 1:45:00.400]  It absolutely is.
[1:45:00.400 --> 1:45:03.400]  I think his sons turned him in so that they could stay out of jail,
[1:45:03.400 --> 1:45:05.400]  but there's as guilty as anybody else.
[1:45:05.400 --> 1:45:08.400]  And Madoff is going to get off read because they're already planning
[1:45:08.400 --> 1:45:09.400]  an insanity defense.
[1:45:09.400 --> 1:45:12.400]  He had so much money, he just went crazy,
[1:45:12.400 --> 1:45:14.400]  and that's why he did this Ponzi scheme,
[1:45:14.400 --> 1:45:16.400]  and he really didn't know that he was doing wrong,
[1:45:16.400 --> 1:45:18.400]  and they're going to do this little tearful thing,
[1:45:18.400 --> 1:45:20.400]  and they're going to get him out of jail,
[1:45:20.400 --> 1:45:23.400]  and it's just going to be this incredible miscarriage of justice,
[1:45:23.400 --> 1:45:28.400]  and the $100 billion losses is going to be dumped on the working class Americans,
[1:45:28.400 --> 1:45:30.400]  like everything else.
[1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:33.400]  And what Americans need to realize right now is the sum total
[1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:36.400]  of all these bailouts, and repays, and coverage,
[1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:39.400]  and compensations dumped on the American taxpayer
[1:45:39.400 --> 1:45:44.400]  already works out to an additional $100,000 per American
[1:45:44.400 --> 1:45:47.400]  in added tax burden that you're going to have to pay
[1:45:47.400 --> 1:45:49.400]  that you will get nothing back from.
[1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:50.400]  And let me stop you.
[1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:52.400]  That's currently what's owed.
[1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:56.400]  If we paid it today, the interest is racking up.
[1:45:56.400 --> 1:45:58.400]  Absolutely.
[1:45:58.400 --> 1:46:02.400]  I mean, that's obligations versus what's currently owed.
[1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:03.400]  Let's go to phone calls.
[1:46:03.400 --> 1:46:05.400]  Ronnie in Texas, you're on the air, sir.
[1:46:05.400 --> 1:46:09.400]  Welcome.
[1:46:09.400 --> 1:46:10.400]  Yes.
[1:46:10.400 --> 1:46:11.400]  Thank you, sir.
[1:46:11.400 --> 1:46:13.400]  With the U.S. taxpayer dollars and Gaza now,
[1:46:13.400 --> 1:46:16.400]  Israeli thugs continually commit collective punishment,
[1:46:16.400 --> 1:46:19.400]  which is a war crime, people.
[1:46:19.400 --> 1:46:20.400]  And why?
[1:46:20.400 --> 1:46:24.400]  Because that bigoted, socialistic, totalitarian criminal regime
[1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:26.400]  of Israel supposedly believes God has, quote,
[1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:30.400]  chosen their own former bigotry over all others.
[1:46:30.400 --> 1:46:32.400]  And why?
[1:46:32.400 --> 1:46:35.400]  Because you and me as U.S. taxpayers continually pay them
[1:46:35.400 --> 1:46:36.400]  to kill people.
[1:46:36.400 --> 1:46:38.400]  So what's going to stop that?
[1:46:38.400 --> 1:46:42.400]  It's when you and me taxpayers stop the payments for killing.
[1:46:42.400 --> 1:46:44.400]  It may slow down.
[1:46:44.400 --> 1:46:47.400]  At least our collective guilt is U.S. taxpayers will finally
[1:46:47.400 --> 1:46:48.400]  begin to lessen.
[1:46:48.400 --> 1:46:50.400]  But who can stop the killing?
[1:46:50.400 --> 1:46:54.400]  Those evil stooges for Israel, you and me, U.S. taxpayers,
[1:46:54.400 --> 1:46:57.400]  must just say no to the status quo.
[1:46:57.400 --> 1:47:00.400]  Ronnie, I appreciate your calling.
[1:47:00.400 --> 1:47:04.400]  Since you mentioned that, Israeli tank fire kills 42
[1:47:04.400 --> 1:47:05.400]  at U.N. school.
[1:47:05.400 --> 1:47:07.400]  That's what the medics are reporting.
[1:47:07.400 --> 1:47:08.400]  This is out of Reuters.
[1:47:08.400 --> 1:47:12.400]  And this is only at one facility.
[1:47:12.400 --> 1:47:14.400]  And most of them teachers and children.
[1:47:14.400 --> 1:47:16.400]  Your comments on that, Mike Rivera.
[1:47:16.400 --> 1:47:19.400]  Yeah, this is the second U.N. school that Israel has destroyed
[1:47:19.400 --> 1:47:22.400]  in Gaza, I think, in the last 24 hours.
[1:47:22.400 --> 1:47:26.400]  And it's absolutely evident that Israel is not targeting
[1:47:26.400 --> 1:47:27.400]  just Hamas.
[1:47:27.400 --> 1:47:29.400]  They're killing everything that moves.
[1:47:29.400 --> 1:47:32.400]  They want to drive out observers.
[1:47:32.400 --> 1:47:35.400]  They've said they're targeting press and international observers.
[1:47:35.400 --> 1:47:36.400]  Go ahead.
[1:47:36.400 --> 1:47:38.400]  Yeah, they already got the press out.
[1:47:38.400 --> 1:47:42.400]  The remaining media in Gaza are confined to a media city
[1:47:42.400 --> 1:47:44.400]  of Israel's designation.
[1:47:44.400 --> 1:47:47.400]  They're trying now to block the Twitter and SMS messages
[1:47:47.400 --> 1:47:49.400]  that are coming out of Gaza.
[1:47:49.400 --> 1:47:51.400]  They're trying to completely isolate it so that the world
[1:47:51.400 --> 1:47:52.400]  does not see what they do.
[1:47:52.400 --> 1:47:54.400]  They kept out the international Red Cross.
[1:47:54.400 --> 1:47:57.400]  And the Red Cross were allowed into the German concentration camps
[1:47:57.400 --> 1:47:58.400]  during World War II.
[1:47:58.400 --> 1:48:00.400]  But Israel won't let them in.
[1:48:00.400 --> 1:48:02.400]  What are they hiding?
[1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:04.400]  Well, we know they're running a siege.
[1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:06.400]  They're leveling those areas like Fallujah.
[1:48:06.400 --> 1:48:08.400]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:48:08.400 --> 1:48:11.400]  Peggy in PA, you're on the air with Mike Rivera.
[1:48:11.400 --> 1:48:12.400]  Hello.
[1:48:12.400 --> 1:48:15.400]  The reason I called is that I would like a comment from either
[1:48:15.400 --> 1:48:19.400]  of you as to how I should steer some research.
[1:48:19.400 --> 1:48:25.400]  I noticed in the 1980s when I noticed the goddess movement
[1:48:25.400 --> 1:48:30.400]  come into popular culture in Europe and in America.
[1:48:30.400 --> 1:48:34.400]  It really didn't go anywhere, sort of fizzled out and disappeared.
[1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:38.400]  And I have noticed, based frankly, Alex,
[1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:42.400]  upon learning the techniques that your guests and you use
[1:48:42.400 --> 1:48:45.400]  to investigate, that you have to look in certain areas.
[1:48:45.400 --> 1:48:51.400]  And I've noticed that it seems to me that there was a government effort
[1:48:51.400 --> 1:48:55.400]  or an effort from some corner to completely eradicate it
[1:48:55.400 --> 1:48:56.400]  from the public consciousness.
[1:48:56.400 --> 1:48:58.400]  You just don't find any comments about it.
[1:48:58.400 --> 1:49:00.400]  Even on the Internet, there's really nothing.
[1:49:00.400 --> 1:49:02.400]  Goddess movement.
[1:49:02.400 --> 1:49:03.400]  Yeah.
[1:49:03.400 --> 1:49:05.400]  The goddess spirituality idea.
[1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:06.400]  Well, I mean, that's everywhere.
[1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:08.400]  That's what the Masons worship.
[1:49:08.400 --> 1:49:10.400]  That's what they worship at Skull and Bones is the goddess
[1:49:10.400 --> 1:49:13.400]  Eulogia, the goddess Columbia for the United States.
[1:49:13.400 --> 1:49:15.400]  Well, let me refine it, Alex.
[1:49:15.400 --> 1:49:18.400]  One thing that they always, I know for a fact,
[1:49:18.400 --> 1:49:21.400]  because of my own examination of old textbooks and so on
[1:49:21.400 --> 1:49:23.400]  and also writings from the 19th century,
[1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:30.400]  is that in Europe, before the warlike tribes came in,
[1:49:30.400 --> 1:49:38.400]  all over Europe, the goddesses went back to like 25,000 BC
[1:49:38.400 --> 1:49:40.400]  and there really was no god.
[1:49:40.400 --> 1:49:43.400]  In other words, it was a very peaceful...
[1:49:43.400 --> 1:49:45.400]  Yeah, listen, I appreciate your call.
[1:49:45.400 --> 1:49:46.400]  I know what you're talking about.
[1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:48.400]  This goes into the Merovingians and all that
[1:49:48.400 --> 1:49:50.400]  and it's actually the Illuminati religion.
[1:49:50.400 --> 1:49:53.400]  You know, the worship, the female side of the god
[1:49:53.400 --> 1:49:55.400]  and so the male side of the god.
[1:49:55.400 --> 1:49:57.400]  I mean, we're not really getting into that today,
[1:49:57.400 --> 1:50:00.400]  but fine, you're welcome to bring that subject up.
[1:50:00.400 --> 1:50:01.400]  That's not really...
[1:50:01.400 --> 1:50:03.400]  Mike, would you like to comment on that?
[1:50:03.400 --> 1:50:05.400]  Well, I'm in agreement with you, Alex.
[1:50:05.400 --> 1:50:07.400]  I don't know where this lady is researching,
[1:50:07.400 --> 1:50:11.400]  but the whole goddess mythology is all over the internet.
[1:50:11.400 --> 1:50:15.400]  My wife actually refers to it a lot in her creative works,
[1:50:15.400 --> 1:50:17.400]  so I don't think there's anything about it being suppressed
[1:50:17.400 --> 1:50:18.400]  or repressed.
[1:50:18.400 --> 1:50:20.400]  It's just a case of fashions and trends.
[1:50:20.400 --> 1:50:22.400]  It was popular for a while.
[1:50:22.400 --> 1:50:24.400]  Now people have moved on.
[1:50:24.400 --> 1:50:26.400]  Yeah, let's...
[1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:27.400]  We're going to go to break here.
[1:50:27.400 --> 1:50:28.400]  Final segment of the microbarrel.
[1:50:28.400 --> 1:50:30.400]  Come back to Joe, Sean, and Chad.
[1:50:30.400 --> 1:50:32.400]  This hour is really going by very quickly.
[1:50:32.400 --> 1:50:34.400]  Be sure to check out Mike's website,

[1:51:52.400 --> 1:51:54.400]  Go to Pepperspray.com.
[1:51:54.400 --> 1:51:59.400]  That's Pepperspray.com, or call 1-800-908-9988.
[1:51:59.400 --> 1:52:01.400]  Call today.
[1:52:01.400 --> 1:52:03.400]  Can I have everybody's attention, please?
[1:52:03.400 --> 1:52:05.400]  I've come with a message of information.
[1:52:05.400 --> 1:52:08.400]  9-11 was an inside job.
[1:52:08.400 --> 1:52:09.400]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:52:09.400 --> 1:52:11.400]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:52:11.400 --> 1:52:14.400]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[1:52:14.400 --> 1:52:16.400]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[1:52:16.400 --> 1:52:18.400]  the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR.
[1:52:18.400 --> 1:52:20.400]  They listen to our challenge.
[1:52:20.400 --> 1:52:22.400]  The day that we stop asking questions
[1:52:22.400 --> 1:52:25.400]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[1:52:25.400 --> 1:52:27.400]  to grow at our own door.
[1:52:27.400 --> 1:52:30.400]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:33.400]  a global awakening has taken place.
[1:52:33.400 --> 1:52:35.400]  An inside job?
[1:52:35.400 --> 1:52:37.400]  How dare you?
[1:52:37.400 --> 1:52:41.400]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[1:52:41.400 --> 1:52:43.400]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:52:43.400 --> 1:52:46.400]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:52:46.400 --> 1:52:48.400]  And if the government has not told the truth
[1:52:48.400 --> 1:52:51.400]  in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[1:52:51.400 --> 1:52:52.400]  Truth rising.

[1:54:27.400 --> 1:54:33.400]  The feeling for ten, deal me in.
[1:54:35.400 --> 1:54:37.400]  Coming straight on for you.
[1:54:37.400 --> 1:54:39.400]  Coming straight on for the tyrants.
[1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:41.400]  You've made my mind.
[1:54:41.400 --> 1:54:44.400]  Liberty movement is strong.
[1:54:44.400 --> 1:54:49.400]  Now I'm strong and now I'm coming to you.
[1:54:49.400 --> 1:54:51.400]  Coming straight on.
[1:54:51.400 --> 1:54:54.400]  All right, let's go back to the calls here.
[1:54:54.400 --> 1:54:59.400]  Let's talk to Lori in Hawaii.
[1:54:59.400 --> 1:55:02.400]  Lori, you're on the air with Mike Rivera.
[1:55:02.400 --> 1:55:04.400]  Hi, Alex.
[1:55:04.400 --> 1:55:06.400]  Just a quick background.
[1:55:06.400 --> 1:55:08.400]  I'm from Kauai, Hawaii.
[1:55:08.400 --> 1:55:10.400]  I have an 18-year-old.
[1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:13.400]  It's the hip-hop generation that's going to wake up America too.
[1:55:13.400 --> 1:55:17.400]  For eight years, I voted for Bush.
[1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:18.400]  I supported the war.
[1:55:18.400 --> 1:55:20.400]  And then I finally turned off my TV and found out the truth.
[1:55:20.400 --> 1:55:22.400]  I got to get unbrainwashed.
[1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:26.400]  My question is, aren't we supposed to support Israel?
[1:55:26.400 --> 1:55:31.400]  I'm a Christian and I think our American people are led to believe that.
[1:55:31.400 --> 1:55:33.400]  But is it the government that's corrupt?
[1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:34.400]  I watched Fable to Enemies.
[1:55:34.400 --> 1:55:35.400]  I watched Loose Change.
[1:55:35.400 --> 1:55:37.400]  I watched it all.
[1:55:37.400 --> 1:55:41.400]  It took my 18-year-old seven years to convince me to find out the truth.
[1:55:41.400 --> 1:55:44.400]  And now I've been researching on the Internet and everything like that.
[1:55:44.400 --> 1:55:49.400]  So I wanted to see if you could direct me to some good information for research.
[1:55:49.400 --> 1:55:51.400]  Let me comment on this.
[1:55:51.400 --> 1:55:53.400]  I don't hate Israel.
[1:55:53.400 --> 1:55:55.400]  I don't hate England.
[1:55:55.400 --> 1:55:56.400]  I don't hate Germany.
[1:55:56.400 --> 1:55:57.400]  I don't hate China.
[1:55:57.400 --> 1:56:03.400]  Most governments throughout history are run by groups that want power and control.
[1:56:03.400 --> 1:56:08.400]  And then we'll get Mike's final comment on this because we're almost out of time.
[1:56:08.400 --> 1:56:11.400]  What happens here is this is just more colonialism.
[1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:14.400]  The Ottoman Empire fell after World War I.
[1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:18.400]  They lost control of what was Palestine, what was on the map is Palestine.
[1:56:18.400 --> 1:56:25.400]  Then British Zionists funded, the Rothschilds funded, that's public, it's admitted in Israel,
[1:56:25.400 --> 1:56:30.400]  everything's dedicated to them, to go in and carry out terror attacks to kick the British out,
[1:56:30.400 --> 1:56:32.400]  and then to kick the Arabs out.
[1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:39.400]  And so then around that same time there was financing and funding in U.S. churches,
[1:56:39.400 --> 1:56:42.400]  by the Council of Churches, now the World Council of Churches,
[1:56:42.400 --> 1:56:48.400]  this new religion based around that this is Israel,
[1:56:48.400 --> 1:56:51.400]  and that the Antichrist is going to attack Israel,
[1:56:51.400 --> 1:56:55.400]  and that we have to get behind Israel or we're going to hell.
[1:56:55.400 --> 1:57:01.400]  When my Bible in Revelations in Daniel and Ezekiel says that Israel didn't do what they were supposed to do,
[1:57:01.400 --> 1:57:06.400]  so they were kicked out, and that the Antichrist will go to Israel and say he's God.
[1:57:06.400 --> 1:57:12.400]  And so just from that perspective, you want to argue it on a religious basis, it's completely twisted
[1:57:12.400 --> 1:57:14.400]  compared to what the Bible actually says.
[1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:19.400]  Does that mean I'm even supporting the Muslims or I want them to kill all the Jews and kick them out?
[1:57:19.400 --> 1:57:22.400]  No. The point is Israel's mopping up and pushing everybody out,
[1:57:22.400 --> 1:57:26.400]  and is very secular and doesn't allow Christians to preach in Israel,
[1:57:26.400 --> 1:57:28.400]  and that's not reported here either.
[1:57:28.400 --> 1:57:32.400]  Mike Rivera, and I appreciate your call, you can call back another time we can talk more about it.
[1:57:32.400 --> 1:57:35.400]  I'm sorry we're just out of time, the clock and other guests coming up.
[1:57:35.400 --> 1:57:38.400]  In closing, Mike Rivera will comment on that.
[1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:44.400]  Just real quick, there is no question that Israel has successfully exploited the religious beliefs of American Christians
[1:57:44.400 --> 1:57:49.400]  for purely propagandistic purposes to build support for Israel's actions,
[1:57:49.400 --> 1:57:53.400]  and a lot of people, as this caller was very confused,
[1:57:53.400 --> 1:58:00.400]  because they think what is going on now in Gaza is somehow part of the biblical Israel of 2000 years ago,
[1:58:00.400 --> 1:58:05.400]  and there really is no connection. It is a false link fostered by the current government of Israel
[1:58:05.400 --> 1:58:11.400]  purely to build political support for what otherwise would be seen as violations of the Ten Commandments.
[1:58:11.400 --> 1:58:15.400]  And then meanwhile, we see the Israeli lobby aggressively going after the Second Amendment here,
[1:58:15.400 --> 1:58:19.400]  going, assigned to set up warrantless searches, police state,
[1:58:19.400 --> 1:58:23.400]  and really pushing for anti-democratic moves in the United States,
[1:58:23.400 --> 1:58:28.400]  kind of capturing us as their Hessian mercenary supply chain.
[1:58:28.400 --> 1:58:31.400]  Mike Rivera, I want to thank you for coming on with us,
[1:58:31.400 --> 1:58:35.400]  and we'll talk to you again this same time next month. Thank you so much.
[1:58:35.400 --> 1:58:37.400]  Thank you for having me again.
[1:58:37.400 --> 1:58:39.400]  You bet. We'll be right back.
[1:58:42.400 --> 1:58:48.400]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:51.400 --> 1:58:54.400]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[1:58:54.400 --> 1:58:57.400]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:58:57.400 --> 1:59:01.400]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:59:01.400 --> 1:59:03.400]  bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:59:03.400 --> 1:59:06.400]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:59:06.400 --> 1:59:14.400]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:59:14.400 --> 1:59:20.400]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:59:20.400 --> 1:59:24.400]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:59:24.400 --> 1:59:28.400]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[1:59:28.400 --> 1:59:31.400]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:59:31.400 --> 1:59:36.400]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies.
[1:59:36.400 --> 1:59:40.400]  Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality,
[1:59:40.400 --> 1:59:43.400]  along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:59:43.400 --> 1:59:48.400]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[1:59:48.400 --> 1:59:59.400]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:05.400 --> 2:00:11.400]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers?
[2:00:11.400 --> 2:00:23.400]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:23.400 --> 2:00:27.400]  Well, I have read his writings for years.
[2:00:27.400 --> 2:00:33.400]  And Ron Paul says this is one of the people that's taught him much of what he knows.
[2:00:33.400 --> 2:00:38.400]  This is his first time on air with us, but I hope it's the first of many visits.
[2:00:38.400 --> 2:00:45.400]  Dr. Edwin Vieira, Jr., PhD, JD, holds four degrees from Harvard College,
[2:00:45.400 --> 2:00:49.400]  AM, PhD, Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and JD, Harvard Law School.
[2:00:49.400 --> 2:00:53.400]  For more than 30 years, he's practiced law with emphasis on constitutional issues.
[2:00:53.400 --> 2:00:56.400]  He is also one of our country's most imminent constitutional attorneys,
[2:00:56.400 --> 2:00:59.400]  having brought four cases that were accepted by the Supreme Court,
[2:00:59.400 --> 2:01:02.400]  and having won three of them. In the Supreme Court of the United States,
[2:01:02.400 --> 2:01:06.400]  he successfully argued, or briefed the case leading to the landmark decision,
[2:01:06.400 --> 2:01:11.400]  Aboud v. Detroit Board of Education, Chicago Teacher's Union v. Hudson,
[2:01:11.400 --> 2:01:16.400]  Communications Workers of America v. Beck, which established constitutional and statutory limitations
[2:01:16.400 --> 2:01:22.400]  on the use of labor unions in which private and the public sectors may apply fees extracted
[2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:26.400]  from the non-union workers as a condition of their employment.
[2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:31.400]  He's one of the world's foremost authorities about the role of the Constitution as it relates to money
[2:01:31.400 --> 2:01:36.400]  and has written numerous monograms and articles in scholarly journals and lectures throughout the country.
[2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:42.400]  His most recent work on money and banking is the two-volume pieces of eight that Ron Paul cites,
[2:01:42.400 --> 2:01:46.400]  the monetary powers and disabilities of the United States Constitution,
[2:01:46.400 --> 2:01:50.400]  the most comprehensive study in the existence of American monetary law and history viewed
[2:01:50.400 --> 2:01:54.400]  from a constitutional perspective available at piecesofeight.us.
[2:01:54.400 --> 2:02:02.400]  He's also the co-author of Nome de Plume or the political novel Cashmaker, a federal affair 2000,
[2:02:02.400 --> 2:02:05.400]  and it just goes on and on. Sir, I didn't do a pre-interview with you,
[2:02:05.400 --> 2:02:09.400]  but I want to get into the real history of the Second Amendment,
[2:02:09.400 --> 2:02:12.400]  a brief history of what our real monetary system should be
[2:02:12.400 --> 2:02:16.400]  versus the private offshore federal reserve, and then, of course,
[2:02:16.400 --> 2:02:21.400]  your overall view of the police state, the classical police state,
[2:02:21.400 --> 2:02:28.400]  that is unfolding in this nation. So, Mr. Vieira, it's great to have you on with us.
[2:02:28.400 --> 2:02:31.400]  My pleasure to be with you, Alex. Where would you like to begin?
[2:02:31.400 --> 2:02:34.400]  Well, we're going to break here in about three minutes and come back in a long segment.
[2:02:34.400 --> 2:02:37.400]  Tell folks about your awakening, some of the work you've done,
[2:02:37.400 --> 2:02:40.400]  and some of the things you think are most important right now.
[2:02:40.400 --> 2:02:45.400]  Well, going in reverse order from what you listed,
[2:02:45.400 --> 2:02:52.400]  we are seeing the development, quite clearly, intentional development of a top-down police state apparatus
[2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:58.400]  out of Washington, D.C. I do not believe that this thing was set up originally
[2:02:58.400 --> 2:03:03.400]  because of the 9-11 event, the so-called International Terrorism Problem,
[2:03:03.400 --> 2:03:07.400]  because, of course, we know the Patriot Act, the first version of the Patriot Act,
[2:03:07.400 --> 2:03:11.400]  was drawn up long before 9-11. They were simply waiting for some episode
[2:03:11.400 --> 2:03:15.400]  to justify putting it into legislation.
[2:03:15.400 --> 2:03:19.400]  I think what they're really anticipating, and we're seeing it unfolding now in the markets,
[2:03:19.400 --> 2:03:25.400]  is the breakdown of this basically corrupt and unsustainable monetary and banking system
[2:03:25.400 --> 2:03:29.400]  centered around the Federal Reserve. And they know when this comes down
[2:03:29.400 --> 2:03:36.400]  in a world system entirely based upon central bank fiat currency and credit expansion,
[2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:41.400]  as a method for creating money, that they're going to see social, economic,
[2:03:41.400 --> 2:03:46.400]  and political dislocations unlike any that have been seen before,
[2:03:46.400 --> 2:03:51.400]  certainly maybe in order of magnitude worse than occurred during the Great Depression
[2:03:51.400 --> 2:03:55.400]  in the United States from 29 to 32 when it really broke.
[2:03:55.400 --> 2:04:00.400]  And they are anticipating that under those circumstances, they're going to need to crack down on the population
[2:04:00.400 --> 2:04:03.400]  with essentially police-type controls.
[2:04:03.400 --> 2:04:08.400]  And that's why this whole Homeland Security paranoia has been generated out of Washington
[2:04:08.400 --> 2:04:13.400]  is to prepare the groundwork for that on the one hand in developing the agencies
[2:04:13.400 --> 2:04:16.400]  and forces that are necessary to put it into effect,
[2:04:16.400 --> 2:04:20.400]  then, on the other hand, creating the psychological acceptance,
[2:04:20.400 --> 2:04:26.400]  acquiescence, if you will, on the basis of which the population will simply be expected
[2:04:26.400 --> 2:04:29.400]  to roll over for this kind of control.
[2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:34.400]  And ultimately, this is directed towards whether intentionally or not,
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:39.400]  it's certainly going to result in the destruction of our basic constitutional form of government
[2:04:39.400 --> 2:04:42.400]  and all the freedoms and economic prosperity that go with it.
[2:04:42.400 --> 2:04:45.400]  All right, Dr. Edwin Vieira is our guest.
[2:04:45.400 --> 2:04:50.400]  And we'll be back with Dr. Edwin Vieira right after this quick break.
[2:04:50.400 --> 2:04:54.400]  And we're going to break down what this top-down police state is going to be like
[2:04:54.400 --> 2:04:57.400]  and how do we try to avert it or reverse it.
[2:04:57.400 --> 2:04:59.400]  Stay with us.
[2:05:27.400 --> 2:05:29.400]  Thank you.
[2:05:57.400 --> 2:06:00.400]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[2:06:27.400 --> 2:06:29.400]  Thank you very much.
[2:06:57.400 --> 2:07:01.400]  Bring down the New World Order, prisonplanet.tv.
[2:07:27.400 --> 2:07:29.400]  Thank you very much.
[2:07:58.400 --> 2:08:08.400]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[2:08:08.400 --> 2:08:12.400]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:16.400 --> 2:08:19.400]  Dr. Edwin Vieira is our guest for stations that just joined us.
[2:08:19.400 --> 2:08:26.400]  We were getting into where this top constitutional scholar has won three times at the Supreme Court.
[2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:33.400]  The top-down police state, the classical police state, they've borrowed from the Nazis, the communists,
[2:08:33.400 --> 2:08:39.400]  the inquisitors of old, all of it integrated into this surveillance grid, this total federalization.
[2:08:39.400 --> 2:08:44.400]  They smoke screened the public saying, oh, this whole police state's defied al-Qaeda, al-CIAta.
[2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:47.400]  And then now they're saying, oh, we're going to use 20,000 U.S. troops.
[2:08:47.400 --> 2:08:52.400]  Oh, Obama's going to have a million-person corps as big as the military, domestic spies.
[2:08:52.400 --> 2:08:56.400]  You're going to have to be drafted 18 to 24 to serve the government.
[2:08:56.400 --> 2:09:01.400]  This is all happening, and now they're admitting that they set it all up for the financial collapse.
[2:09:01.400 --> 2:09:03.400]  So we're going over this.
[2:09:03.400 --> 2:09:05.400]  There's no more denial here.
[2:09:05.400 --> 2:09:11.400]  They've now, in their scholarly publications and in Pentagon directives and Army War College documents, admit this is happening
[2:09:11.400 --> 2:09:15.400]  and that they'll even use Canadian, Mexican troops, foreign troops.
[2:09:15.400 --> 2:09:24.400]  And then the Congress earlier last year said, why aren't we being informed? And the President said, PDD 51, you're not involved in continuity of government.
[2:09:24.400 --> 2:09:30.400]  So we've got one of the preeminent scholars on the line with us, Dr. Edwin Vieira.
[2:09:30.400 --> 2:09:40.400]  Sir, please continue. Let's start there with the entire police state, what makes a police state, and then hopefully how we stop it.
[2:09:40.400 --> 2:09:45.400]  Well, let's go back to the antithesis of the police state. So we'll have a baseline to work from.
[2:09:45.400 --> 2:09:53.400]  And of course, that's the Constitution of the United States, which is based on principles antithetical and really contradictory in every sense
[2:09:53.400 --> 2:09:56.400]  to the concept of a top-down police state.
[2:09:56.400 --> 2:10:01.400]  The top-down police state is talking about control from the top down and obedience from the bottom up.
[2:10:01.400 --> 2:10:04.400]  And of course, our constitutional system works in exactly the opposite manner.
[2:10:04.400 --> 2:10:12.400]  It's liberty at the bottom and control coming from the people and then obedience in principle, at least, by the representatives,
[2:10:12.400 --> 2:10:16.400]  whether elected or appointed at the upper levels of government, state, or nation.
[2:10:16.400 --> 2:10:24.400]  If you look at the Constitution, and I always like to say, listen, when something goes wrong with the machinery that you're using,
[2:10:24.400 --> 2:10:30.400]  the smart individual turns to the book of instructions, and the book of instructions for our system is the Constitution of the United States.
[2:10:30.400 --> 2:10:40.400]  The only place in the Constitution where it refers to security is in the Second Amendment, a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[2:10:40.400 --> 2:10:47.400]  And it's a particular kind of security. It's not police state security. It's not all embracing welfare state security.
[2:10:47.400 --> 2:10:50.400]  It's the security of a free state. That's the goal.
[2:10:50.400 --> 2:10:58.400]  Instrumentally, Second Amendment tells us that something called the militia is necessary for that purpose.
[2:10:58.400 --> 2:11:05.400]  Again, very interesting. That's the only place in the Constitution at the present time where it says that anything is necessary for any purpose.
[2:11:05.400 --> 2:11:09.400]  It doesn't say Congress is necessary, the President is necessary, the Supreme Court is necessary.
[2:11:09.400 --> 2:11:16.400]  It says that a well-regulated militia is necessary for this ultimately important purpose of securing a free state.
[2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:27.400]  So if we were to take that term, homeland security, and pretend for the moment that it's not loaded from the point of view of the people who want to put a police state into operation,
[2:11:27.400 --> 2:11:32.400]  just take that as a neutral term. We'd say, well, the Constitution tells us how to provide for homeland security.
[2:11:32.400 --> 2:11:39.400]  We want homeland security in the sense of a security of a free state. We need this thing called a well-regulated militia.
[2:11:39.400 --> 2:11:45.400]  And the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. I mean, it's right there.
[2:11:45.400 --> 2:11:53.400]  It's us. They try to play with the definition of a well-regulated militia claiming it's the 1906 National Guard when it has nothing to do with that.
[2:11:53.400 --> 2:12:03.400]  It is the armed population against street thugs and a tyrannical government, not just our right, but our duty to overthrow something that becomes destructive of our Declaration of Independence.
[2:12:03.400 --> 2:12:12.400]  Well, that's precisely correct, because if you take yourself back to the time of ratification of the Constitution, now it's 1787 or the Bill of Rights, 1791,
[2:12:12.400 --> 2:12:18.400]  and you ask yourself, what did that term militia mean to those people?
[2:12:18.400 --> 2:12:27.400]  Clearly, there's no definition of it in the Constitution. Most of the terms in the Constitution of great consequence are not defined, because they didn't need to be defined.
[2:12:27.400 --> 2:12:36.400]  People understood precisely what they meant. At that point in time, every adult American in this country knew what a well-regulated militia was.
[2:12:36.400 --> 2:12:45.400]  Because we were a paramilitary armed camp of frontier and businessmen and the freest people in the world.
[2:12:45.400 --> 2:12:55.400]  Well, they were all members. In every state, in the Union, all the 13 states, statutes had provided, actually going well back into the colonial period.
[2:12:55.400 --> 2:13:06.400]  Many instances of the early 1600s had provided for these structures called militias, and they were the same in every colony and every state leading up to the Constitution.
[2:13:06.400 --> 2:13:16.400]  They embodied every adult free male, and in many instances even some freed slaves were allowed to participate in this.
[2:13:16.400 --> 2:13:29.400]  And their basic principle was precisely what you suggested, that every adult free male had a responsibility, not simply a right, but a duty to be armed, to be trained,
[2:13:29.400 --> 2:13:41.400]  to be ready to be called out in any kind of emergency. They used to use the term alarm with specific statutory terms you see used for these emergencies that we would call Homeland Security problems.
[2:13:41.400 --> 2:13:58.400]  And it extended across the entire community. So you didn't have a separation in the provision of what we would call Homeland Security between the people themselves and some elite group of police or Homeland Security agencies
[2:13:58.400 --> 2:14:10.400]  or what have you that have been developed in more recent times. And this was fundamentally important, not simply for the provision of security, but for the maintenance of true democracy.
[2:14:10.400 --> 2:14:19.400]  That is, the people who were going to be in control of this situation were the people themselves. We, the people, as the Constitution, identify them.
[2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:31.400]  You know, Dr, the founders said over and over again, this was a few things they were unanimous on, they said we cannot fall from without because we are an armed, you know, free nation of people that are trained to defend themselves.
[2:14:31.400 --> 2:14:37.400]  If we fall, it will be from within, and it will be a central bank engaging in money changing.
[2:14:37.400 --> 2:14:45.400]  Right. And of course, the important thing I think that we've lost in this whole concept is we talked to the average person about the militia.
[2:14:45.400 --> 2:14:50.400]  They do give you what I would call the stereotypical answer. Oh, that's the National Guard.
[2:14:50.400 --> 2:14:57.400]  Well, the National Guard wasn't formed until it actually began in 1903. That was the first statute so-called DIC Act that was passed.
[2:14:57.400 --> 2:15:02.400]  So it's about 150 years removed from the actual constitutional militia.
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:12.400]  But the main problem that I see is people have forgotten their important role in maintaining ultimate democratic control over this government.
[2:15:12.400 --> 2:15:27.400]  And as a result of that, one of the things, of course, that happened was the development over a long period of time, but finally culminating in 1913 with the Federal Reserve System, where once again an elite group gained control of one of the two basic powers of government.
[2:15:27.400 --> 2:15:34.400]  All political philosophy will tell you the two great powers of government are the power of the purse and the power of the sword.
[2:15:34.400 --> 2:15:47.400]  And they have gained control over the power of the purse through the Federal Reserve System, and the power of the sword in the hands of the people where it should be, according to the Second Amendment, has essentially atrophied.
[2:15:47.400 --> 2:16:00.400]  So now the people are looking to these Homeland Security agencies, whether they're local police or state police or federal agencies, and they are not seeing themselves as the source of their ultimate security.
[2:16:00.400 --> 2:16:14.400]  So now we have the two things coalescing, because the Federal Reserve System, as any good economist would have predicted, people such as yourself and I have been predicted for decades, I wouldn't say, going back with me into the 1970s,
[2:16:14.400 --> 2:16:20.400]  it is collapsing because it's inherently unstable. This is not a system that can be maintained in the long run.
[2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:38.400]  And we are about to see Homeland Security problems of a very significant form and spread throughout the country. And at that point, the security responses or the responses to these problems should be coming from the people themselves.
[2:16:38.400 --> 2:16:54.400]  But what's happening is that the same group in control of the Federal Reserve System is dictating to us the method by which the problems which it has created are going to be, quote, unquote, solved by it and its friends.
[2:16:54.400 --> 2:17:08.400]  And Doctor, Doctor, if I could just interject your take on this as you continue laying this out. They premeditatedly with problem reaction solution and they state this, knew this. They know their system is going to cause this depression.
[2:17:08.400 --> 2:17:23.400]  They know it's going to cause civil unrest and rioting and then the public will beg for troops and federalization on the streets and then that will set the precedent, they believe forever, for the full final conversion to the tyranny.
[2:17:23.400 --> 2:17:42.400]  Well, I think there's no question that they understand the fragility of this system. And there's also no question in my mind that they intend to use any kind of, let's not even call it catastrophic event, but serious economic dislocation to advance further steps in their political agenda.
[2:17:42.400 --> 2:18:05.400]  What I am wondering is whether the system is not getting out of control. I think it is. I think it is. And I think that's why it's vitally important because now if that is the case, if it politically and economically is getting out of their control in a real sense, now is the opportunity for the American people to step up and reassert their own control over this system.
[2:18:05.400 --> 2:18:19.400]  And speak to the microcosm of that. The police admit they have no right or duty to protect you. They have no liability to protect you. Then how dare Chicago and DC then say you have no right to protect yourself.
[2:18:19.400 --> 2:18:38.400]  This is a basic, God-given or organic logo, law of the universe that any creature has a right to defend itself even if some dictator says you don't have the right. And so we now have to say, look, we are going to defend ourselves, whether you like it or not, because you can't and won't defend us.
[2:18:38.400 --> 2:18:52.400]  I think that's exactly correct. And it's especially the can't aspect of this. Even if they wanted to, even if you believe that those 20,000 troop deployments that they're thinking about in their own minds might be sufficient.
[2:18:52.400 --> 2:19:14.400]  We know that they can't be. Given the kind of social breakdown that may occur as a major economic crunch takes over. They simply don't have the manpower. They simply don't have the level of training. They simply don't have the ability to deploy people into all of the areas of this country where serious economic and social dislocations may take place.
[2:19:14.400 --> 2:19:24.400]  And then what are they going to do about essentially economic reconstruction? Troops. I don't care how many you have. Troops are not the appropriate method for dealing with that problem.
[2:19:24.400 --> 2:19:36.400]  That has to be dealt with by local people themselves, reconstructing their own economies, using alternative currencies when Federal Reserve notes are no longer acceptable internationally and probably domestically as well.
[2:19:36.400 --> 2:19:50.400]  Dealing with their own questions of local police. And if we the people ourselves in our own localities don't take that system, that situation in hand, things are going to get out of hand very quickly. They can't be controlled from the top down.
[2:19:50.400 --> 2:20:00.400]  Dr. Vieira, stay there. When we come back, we'll give out your websites and talk about some of your books and materials, but talk about solutions, what we're going into and where you see things going. Stay with us.

[2:22:16.400 --> 2:22:23.400]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:22:23.400 --> 2:22:30.400]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:22:30.400 --> 2:22:34.400]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:22:34.400 --> 2:22:46.400]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies.

[2:24:17.400 --> 2:24:24.400]  Some of your own sites, some of the publisher's sites, where should people go to visit to find out more about your important work?
[2:24:24.400 --> 2:24:40.400]  Well, one that we're working on now is called committeesofsafety.com, which is actually a group that's centered in Connecticut and trying to develop a template for what I call the revitalization of the constitutional militia of the several states.
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:46.400]  Isn't that the ancient name of the groups that would manage the militias?
[2:24:46.400 --> 2:25:03.400]  You got it. I think that's why it was chosen, because what we need to do is to go back and get citizens organized to develop the necessary statutory plans because it really has to be done if it's going to be done in a properly constitutional format at the state level.
[2:25:03.400 --> 2:25:13.400]  Let's speak to that before you leave. This is a short segment. We've got the rest of the hour, but I wanted to bring up the ancestral, almost memories, if you want to call it that, are instincts as Americans.
[2:25:13.400 --> 2:25:23.400]  Were you heartened by seeing all-time record gun sales when Obama was elected? As you know, for the audience, he is for gun bans. He says that's reasonable, and his lawyers speak.
[2:25:23.400 --> 2:25:30.400]  I mean, is that not a good sign that the people fundamentally, and even a lot of liberals I know are now buying guns, realize...
[2:25:30.400 --> 2:25:43.400]  Sure. In two ways, Alex. Number one, it shows a fundamental distrust of this centralized governmental system and a denial of the belief that Mr. Obama is actually going to change things.
[2:25:43.400 --> 2:25:56.400]  I think that's healthy. Let's be realistic about the political world in which we live. And number two, it's a recognition to the point that you made that in the final analysis, if we are not going to defend ourselves, then we are not going to be defended.
[2:25:56.400 --> 2:26:07.400]  That's a very short answer. We have to provide our own homeland security, our own security of a free state, because if we don't, even our local police, and let's assume that we can, you know, trust those folks that they're acting in good faith,
[2:26:07.400 --> 2:26:17.400]  they are simply not capable institutionally of providing this level of security that we're going to need. If we don't do it, we're not going to have it.
[2:26:17.400 --> 2:26:32.400]  Well, also the modern police configuration is not the swashbuckling real tough guys that we're locally controlled. We had in the past that could deal with things. It is a classic, you know, cover their butt in their little armored citadels whenever a real crisis happens.
[2:26:32.400 --> 2:26:45.400]  Well, that's another one of the problems. They say institutionally they have other difficulties on top of this. But even if you assumed this earlier model, it still wouldn't function given the level of problems that we're going to be facing.
[2:26:45.400 --> 2:26:59.400]  So we have to come back once again to the realization that self-government requires your and my participation. Self-government is not a spectator sport, and ultimately self-government has this most important power behind it.
[2:26:59.400 --> 2:27:07.400]  The power of the person. I hate quoting this guy, but he was correct because he says the same thing as the Second Amendment, somewhat different language.
[2:27:07.400 --> 2:27:21.400]  I would say tongue. What did he say? All the power goes out of the barrel of a gun. Yes. Right. The people who have that ultimate military power are the ones who are going to determine the political structure and operations of their society.
[2:27:21.400 --> 2:27:33.400]  And if it isn't the people themselves, we the people who control that power as the Second Amendment says we should add must, then that governing power will fall into the hands of someone else and we will not like the result.
[2:27:33.400 --> 2:27:43.400]  It is immediately forfeited to the tyrant always in history. The outcome is always the same. And that's why I hope the listeners out there realize this and spread the word.
[2:27:43.400 --> 2:27:50.400]  Because if we're not involved politically and don't demand our sovereign rights, then that vacuum will be filled with the parasites.
[2:27:50.400 --> 2:28:04.400]  That's exactly right. If you don't demand your rights by actually exercising them, it's not simply a matter of going to legislators and saying, oh, please do this or please do that. A well-regulated militia requires your participation.
[2:28:04.400 --> 2:28:08.400]  And if you won't do that, then your rights are simply going to go away one way or the other.
[2:28:08.400 --> 2:28:25.400]  On the other side of the coin, we see the tyrants exercising unconstitutional classic despotism to set the precedent and acclimate the public. So they are practicing looting. They are practicing tyranny. They are practicing warrantless wiretaps against the American people and then flaunting it.
[2:28:25.400 --> 2:28:41.400]  That's right. We don't have to encourage them in that activity. They'll do that spontaneously. We have to get ourselves out of those chairs, out of those sofas, turn off those televisions and get active in the political realm of self-government in order to have the kind of homeland security that we need,
[2:28:41.400 --> 2:28:54.400]  which the Constitution tells us is the only one we're having, the security of a free state. What's the point of having homeland security in a police state? Is that security? Of course, it's the exact opposite of security.
[2:28:54.400 --> 2:29:10.400]  Sir, you've had a lot of foresight with your predictions. We're going to break here in a moment, but come back in a long, you know, 15-minute segment or longer. I would like you to break down how you believe this will unfold versus how you wish it would unfold
[2:29:10.400 --> 2:29:27.400]  or different avenues, different ideas of where you see this going and solutions that I know you're working on feverishly that people can get involved in now to counter this as we go deeper down this rat hole. Any other websites that listeners should check out?
[2:29:27.400 --> 2:29:43.400]  Well, I'm going to be putting up some more material on my EdwinViera.com, which is really just a holding place right now. So as these things come out, probably I'll be announcing them in columns on news with views and we'll get the word out as I'm developing it.
[2:29:43.400 --> 2:29:50.400]  All right, stay there. Ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake, this is the greatest threat our republic and the world has ever faced.
[2:29:50.400 --> 2:30:01.400]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:01.400 --> 2:30:19.400]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight? Only to find the one that you have is broken. The batteries are dead or it's just not bright enough. You need the pack light. The pack light is the longest lasting flashlight on the market and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[2:30:19.400 --> 2:30:34.400]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage and home. The pack light can survive severe impact, be frozen solid and still work flawlessly. The pack light is so durable, soldiers overseas rely on them and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker magazine.
[2:30:34.400 --> 2:31:01.400]  The pack light comes with a 25-year warranty and prices startage is $12.99.

[2:31:01.400 --> 2:31:10.400]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground here and we knew what to do. Or at least we thought we did.
[2:31:10.400 --> 2:31:17.400]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[2:31:17.400 --> 2:31:26.400]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:31:26.400 --> 2:31:33.400]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[2:31:33.400 --> 2:31:42.400]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:31:42.400 --> 2:32:00.400]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com. If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[2:32:00.400 --> 2:32:03.400]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[2:32:03.400 --> 2:32:10.400]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with a reflective spray. The reflection blinded our camera.
[2:32:10.400 --> 2:32:19.400]  We are under the microscope. Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety, but you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.
[2:32:19.400 --> 2:32:29.400]  Have a fighting chance with sprayyourplate.com's photo blocker. When properly applied, this revolutionary product has proven itself to be the most effective device available against traffic cameras.
[2:32:29.400 --> 2:32:34.400]  Invisible to the naked eye, your license plate when flashed will be overexposed and unreadable to the cameras.
[2:32:34.400 --> 2:32:45.400]  Save your money. Go to sprayyourplate.com at sprayyourplate.com and check out the newscast showing the photo blocker in action, proving that the sprayyourplate's photo blocker works against traffic cameras.
[2:32:45.400 --> 2:32:56.400]  Go to sprayyourplate.com or call 1-800-276-9601. That's 1-800-276-9601. Don't give your money to the state.
[2:32:56.400 --> 2:33:13.400]  Spray your plate, and when the cameras flashed, you'll save some cash.
[2:33:13.400 --> 2:33:27.400]  Whether you like it or not, we are going into this system. Whether you like it or not, we have global conquerors.
[2:33:27.400 --> 2:33:38.400]  That's what world government is, run by private financial institutions. The same ones our founding fathers fought, the same people President Andrew Jackson fought, the same people Lincoln fought.
[2:33:38.400 --> 2:33:45.400]  The same deal. Dr. Edwin Vieira is our guest. I covered his bio at the first. Just an amazing individual.
[2:33:45.400 --> 2:33:51.400]  He's been at the Supreme Court four times. One, three of the four. Great constitutional scholar and author lecture.
[2:33:51.400 --> 2:33:55.400]  Okay, we've got about 27 minutes left with you, sir, and I've thrown out all my points.
[2:33:55.400 --> 2:34:03.400]  I'm going to just, just key areas of where you see this going, how we counter it, how we fight it, how you see it unfolding, and what the people need to do.
[2:34:03.400 --> 2:34:12.400]  And if you want to add to it, what is going to happen if we don't fight back? What we know is going to unfold. We've already seen so much of it, but where this is headed?
[2:34:12.400 --> 2:34:20.400]  Well, let's start at the end. If we don't take some appropriate action, we are going to see first the imposition of a financial police state in this country,
[2:34:20.400 --> 2:34:28.400]  because that's the only way they're going to be able to bring control out of the chaos that the breakdown of the Federal Reserve system is causing, and maintain their own power.
[2:34:28.400 --> 2:34:38.400]  I mean, that's obvious. That's the key. They need to maintain their own power. And then that may morph, if you will, into some kind of regional governmental structure,
[2:34:38.400 --> 2:34:46.400]  which will be the rationalization for creating a new regional currency. They've floated names like the Amaro, or if you want to go to a higher level, the Phoenix.
[2:34:46.400 --> 2:34:57.400]  It was floated a few years ago. And obviously that will be, if you follow the historical trends in this, that will be the method that they'll attempt to use to expand
[2:34:57.400 --> 2:35:04.400]  and maintain their control over the monetary system. All right, so that's their plan in a sense. I'll leave that aside.
[2:35:04.400 --> 2:35:12.400]  They're going to do what they're going to do. We have to respond to this in our own way. Our immediate problem is, of course, the breakdown of the monetary system,
[2:35:12.400 --> 2:35:19.400]  because that's where the great wave, almost a tsunami of economic and social chaos is going to develop.
[2:35:19.400 --> 2:35:30.400]  Now, it certainly would be possible if we could, in Congress, in principle, pass some of the legislation that Ron Paul has proposed for ending the Federal Reserve system,
[2:35:30.400 --> 2:35:40.400]  very, very unlikely, obviously, with the Obama administration and the Democratic Congress. It's certainly possible to be able to do something like that on a smaller scale,
[2:35:40.400 --> 2:35:49.400]  at a state level. I have, in fact, drafted a bill originally from New Hampshire. It's on a website called goldmoneybill.org,
[2:35:49.400 --> 2:35:57.400]  and it can be applied with a little bit of appropriate tweaking to almost any other state for gradually bringing the state finances,
[2:35:57.400 --> 2:36:07.400]  and then one would hope, as a consequence of that, a large segment of the state's private economy back to a sound, gold, and silver monetary base.
[2:36:07.400 --> 2:36:13.400]  As far as I know now, there are three or four states where there are some legislators who are actively considering that.
[2:36:13.400 --> 2:36:18.400]  And there are some cities that have their own paper script now popping up in neighborhoods.
[2:36:18.400 --> 2:36:26.400]  We can see that happen as well. So there are a number of possibilities there as people begin to think about the use of alternative currencies.
[2:36:26.400 --> 2:36:31.400]  The thing that worries me a little bit is that we don't have a sufficient basis in public education,
[2:36:31.400 --> 2:36:37.400]  so that the large percentage of the population simply doesn't have any idea about this alternative.
[2:36:37.400 --> 2:36:40.400]  They don't seem to understand even that it's really necessary.
[2:36:40.400 --> 2:36:45.400]  They'll kind of hold on to the Federal Reserve system until the whole house of cards crashes down in their heads.
[2:36:45.400 --> 2:36:52.400]  So we need public education number one in that area. And then number two, we really do have to be prepared for the possibility,
[2:36:52.400 --> 2:36:57.400]  if it's not the likelihood, that this monetary system will, in fact, come down in the short term.
[2:36:57.400 --> 2:37:01.400]  Looking at the prognostications, I hate to make prognostications.
[2:37:01.400 --> 2:37:09.400]  But I would say, my gosh, 18 months to two years at the outside before we see some massive inflationary events,
[2:37:09.400 --> 2:37:16.400]  and perhaps a large segment of the world bailing out of the Federal Reserve system, refusing to accept the Federal Reserve currency as it were.
[2:37:16.400 --> 2:37:21.400]  Well, even the economist is coming out and saying, we're in a depression already.
[2:37:21.400 --> 2:37:25.400]  Well, if the depression and then hyperinflation on top of that, so you have the worst of all possible.
[2:37:25.400 --> 2:37:28.400]  You have a great down of the currency simultaneously.
[2:37:28.400 --> 2:37:31.400]  And that leads to social dislocation on a mass scale.
[2:37:31.400 --> 2:37:42.400]  So assuming that that's coming and assuming that we can't move in the direction of an alternative currency fast enough to mitigate that or prevent that kind of a collateral.
[2:37:42.400 --> 2:37:45.400]  What's the next step that we need to be prepared for?
[2:37:45.400 --> 2:37:52.400]  Well, that's providing the security of a free state that is going to be necessary to overcome these dislocations,
[2:37:52.400 --> 2:37:55.400]  especially at the local and state level.
[2:37:55.400 --> 2:38:01.400]  And that's why for several years now, tied into this prediction, I think not much of a prediction is obvious,
[2:38:01.400 --> 2:38:15.400]  that the monetary system is coming down, is a necessity for people to organize themselves at the state level to cause the state legislatures to pass the appropriate statutes to revitalize their state militia.
[2:38:15.400 --> 2:38:21.400]  Because under the Constitution, the militia are described as the militia of the several states.
[2:38:21.400 --> 2:38:24.400]  This is a state institution in each state.
[2:38:24.400 --> 2:38:27.400]  Let me talk about a basic concept of federalism here.
[2:38:27.400 --> 2:38:30.400]  It's not top down, but bottom up organization.
[2:38:30.400 --> 2:38:36.400]  Doctor, I want you to go into that in detail, but let me just add a little caveat to get your take on it, because it's so important.
[2:38:36.400 --> 2:38:49.400]  As you know, but the listeners may not, Homeland Security has announced, Northcom has announced, Secretary of Defense Gates has announced what we saw them setting up quietly decades ago and coming to a head now in 2008, 2009.
[2:38:49.400 --> 2:39:02.400]  They are absorbing the National Guard from the governor's control as a full federal force, and that it says the governors will, quote, serve at federal pleasure as dual-headed commanders under federal control.
[2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:17.400]  So you're saying go back to true localism, which can provide the real security, but instead they're trying to evolve in the opposite direction towards the crossing the Rubicon classic imperial national police force.
[2:39:17.400 --> 2:39:25.400]  Oh, exactly. And what this proves is that the National Guard, and of course I'm not against the National Guard in principle, but the National Guard is not the constitutional militia.
[2:39:25.400 --> 2:39:39.400]  If it were the constitutional militia, not only would all of the officers be appointed solely by the states, but there would be no way that this instrument could be federalized, as it were, except for three very specific federal purposes,
[2:39:39.400 --> 2:39:49.400]  executing the law, suppressing insurrections and repelling invasions. So what we're looking at here is just the proof positive of the fact National Guard is an adjunct of the regular armed forces.
[2:39:49.400 --> 2:40:01.400]  So we really don't have a constitutional militia structure. I think in any state that I'm aware of, there are a few states that have some kind of truncated militia structure still in existence.
[2:40:01.400 --> 2:40:06.400]  New York may be one. They call it the New York State Guard, and I think Texas has something similar.
[2:40:06.400 --> 2:40:18.400]  Alabama. But they're a very small number. A very small number. I think in New York it's 60,000 members, and it's supposed to pay constitutionally every able-bodied man.
[2:40:18.400 --> 2:40:27.400]  And now today, potentially every able-bodied woman would have. And as you know, now Homeland Security has been coming in and recruiting and using them and directing the state guards.
[2:40:27.400 --> 2:40:36.400]  That's right. So we have another problem there because of this constant emphasis on top-down centralized control coming out of Washington, D.C.
[2:40:36.400 --> 2:40:43.400]  So we have to reverse that. We have to reverse it for a number of reasons. First, because that's not the mechanism that's going to provide us with a free state.
[2:40:43.400 --> 2:40:48.400]  But secondly, it's not the mechanism that's workable if we have a major economic breakdown.
[2:40:48.400 --> 2:40:50.400]  Evidence by Katrina.
[2:40:50.400 --> 2:40:57.400]  Yeah, that's right. Evidence by Katrina, which was a predicted breakdown. They knew what was coming, and they weren't capable of dealing with it.
[2:40:57.400 --> 2:41:10.400]  If we're talking about an economic breakdown as a result of a collapse of the whole monetary and banking system, nobody can predict how far that will go, how difficult it will be to set up alternative economic structures in the localities,
[2:41:10.400 --> 2:41:14.400]  what kind of resources will be available. That certainly cannot be done by...
[2:41:14.400 --> 2:41:23.400]  Even if you assume that the Homeland Security operation was run by people of eminent goodwill, as Madison said, if your government were run by angels, right?
[2:41:23.400 --> 2:41:29.400]  It still could not perform the function necessary simply because it doesn't have the manpower, doesn't have the information, doesn't have access to the...
[2:41:29.400 --> 2:41:33.400]  And even if they were logistical masters, they couldn't do it.
[2:41:33.400 --> 2:41:40.400]  No, they couldn't possibly do it. We're talking about what used to be called the problem of rational economic calculation in terms of socialistic central management.
[2:41:40.400 --> 2:41:49.400]  That's the problem they would be facing. So we have to go in this opposite direction. The Constitution has been telling us this since 1787 and 1791.
[2:41:49.400 --> 2:41:56.400]  Apparently, we haven't learned a lesson. Now we're facing the problem. So what I've been proposing to people, when I have a book out, it's called Constitution.
[2:41:56.400 --> 2:42:03.400]  You can go and find it on Amazon. Oh, and by the way, Alex, if people go there, don't worry if it says there's only one or two copies.
[2:42:03.400 --> 2:42:05.400]  That's some kind of glitch in the way they run that system.
[2:42:05.400 --> 2:42:11.400]  Stop there. Stop there. Your phone cut out when you plug the name of the book.
[2:42:11.400 --> 2:42:13.400]  Constitutional Homeland Security.
[2:42:13.400 --> 2:42:15.400]  Constitutional Homeland Security.
[2:42:15.400 --> 2:42:21.400]  That's the important word. Constitutional Homeland Security. Not the kind of Homeland Security they're giving us from Washington.
[2:42:21.400 --> 2:42:30.400]  By the way, I have read some of that. I need to carry that on our online bookstore at infowars.com.
[2:42:30.400 --> 2:42:38.400]  I need to contact you because we're always looking for the best Crème de la Crème material to carry at infowars.com. But please continue.
[2:42:38.400 --> 2:42:46.400]  Okay, we can certainly do that. But any of that, the purpose of the book is to, I wouldn't call it a solution necessarily because it's experimental in a sense.
[2:42:46.400 --> 2:42:54.400]  It's to provide a direction and the program is for people to begin organizing local advocacy groups.
[2:42:54.400 --> 2:43:01.400]  I call them Citizens' Homeland Security Associations. The fellows in Connecticut call it the Committees of Safety, whatever word you want to use.
[2:43:01.400 --> 2:43:07.400]  These are not, quote, militia groups, unquote. They are First Amendment advocacy groups.
[2:43:07.400 --> 2:43:17.400]  The purpose of which is to educate the local community, come up with basically ideas of what needs to be done in your own locality, in your own state.
[2:43:17.400 --> 2:43:28.400]  The specific problems of Homeland Security have to be addressed. Develop a statutory plan, and I suppose at some stage, in fact, right now I'm drafting a statute for Virginia.
[2:43:28.400 --> 2:43:32.400]  People such as myself would become involved in the drafting of statutes.
[2:43:32.400 --> 2:43:41.400]  Interact with those state legislators who have some insight and vision in this area. They get the legislation introduced and then enacted.
[2:43:41.400 --> 2:43:49.400]  And the big selling point of this kind of organization is twofold. Number one, once you have people organized this way, you can put a great deal of pressure on the state legislature.
[2:43:49.400 --> 2:43:56.400]  Because you're talking about potentially several thousand people who are out there affirmatively asking for this kind of legislation.
[2:43:56.400 --> 2:44:07.400]  And then number two, to make the legislation work will require initially a fairly large contingent of volunteers to step into the breach, as it were.
[2:44:07.400 --> 2:44:15.400]  Because most people out there will need a fair amount of education before they're ready to take on the duties of a proper constitutional militia.
[2:44:15.400 --> 2:44:24.400]  So we're going to have to depend upon volunteers. And once a large segment of the population has been organized this way, there's the ultimate selling point to the legislature.
[2:44:24.400 --> 2:44:34.400]  You put this in, you get this passed, it's not pie in the sky, we have five thousand people in the state of Virginia ready to take on some of these responsibilities and show that this can be done.
[2:44:34.400 --> 2:44:43.400]  And once that experiment has been conducted successfully, and I believe it can be, then thousands and thousands of others are going to want to come into this process.
[2:44:43.400 --> 2:44:52.400]  Because as the crisis develops and they see that the serious consequences are impinging on their lives, what will their alternative be, Alex?
[2:44:52.400 --> 2:44:57.400]  They'll either do this or they'll be at the mercy of God knows what.
[2:44:57.400 --> 2:45:05.400]  Alright, let me stop you there. I've got two points that are questions for you. Let me just make the statement, you can start at the front of the end of the middle.
[2:45:05.400 --> 2:45:17.400]  I'm not for concealed carry in Texas and Florida, but that's kind of the system, its way of training us to turn a right into a privilege,
[2:45:17.400 --> 2:45:28.400]  but it can also be seen in its working model as 25 on average percent crime reductions within two years in states. Those are federal numbers, as you know, of the audience where it's implemented.
[2:45:28.400 --> 2:45:44.400]  So there's a model where that is at least in the right direction towards a militia, where even this gun grabbing system that wants a monopoly of power has been forced through the will to at least try to remove some prohibition
[2:45:44.400 --> 2:45:55.400]  on people who are armed out on the public. So that's a basis already in the true militia and going back towards the roots.
[2:45:55.400 --> 2:46:04.400]  Now that's one point. Then separately back to what you're saying about creating this idea, this alternative, having the legislation there.
[2:46:04.400 --> 2:46:15.400]  I had the idea after the Patriot Act passed and I wrote an analysis of it and people picked up on it and wrote it up in 800 plus cities past its seven states.
[2:46:15.400 --> 2:46:19.400]  The last time I checked was the throwing out the Patriot Act in counties and cities and then the fed said, well, we're the fed you can't do that.
[2:46:19.400 --> 2:46:25.400]  That was decided after the Civil War. And we said, it doesn't matter. This is again moving back towards 10th Amendment regardless of what you say.
[2:46:25.400 --> 2:46:36.400]  And we are declaring that locally the sense of the city councils, the county commissions, the local governments, the parishes, the states that we rebuke what you're doing.
[2:46:36.400 --> 2:46:43.400]  And we're going to order our police and others not to follow unconstitutional orders and look at how successful that was.
[2:46:43.400 --> 2:46:52.400]  So again, more evidence of what you're saying truly codified back into law with its constitutional precedent, how powerful that could be.
[2:46:52.400 --> 2:46:55.400]  So show those two points.
[2:46:55.400 --> 2:47:03.400]  Well, I think you're absolutely right. Let's take those in reverse order. Remember that the militia of the several states are constitutional institutions.
[2:47:03.400 --> 2:47:13.400]  The Constitution recognizes these things. So there is no superiority of the federal government over the militia of the several states, quite the opposite.
[2:47:13.400 --> 2:47:28.400]  The 10th Amendment also and the 2nd Amendment quite obviously reinforce that. But right in the body of the Constitution itself, these institutions are recognized as preexisting the Constitution and as being intended to continue in existence thereafter.
[2:47:28.400 --> 2:47:32.400]  Secondly, your point about the concealed carry licenses.
[2:47:32.400 --> 2:47:50.400]  I would say as well, and I agree with you that the concealed carry license, the only one you need is the 2nd Amendment. But we do have these provisions that have been put in. And as a result of them, a lot of people who would not in the past have been able to use a firearm to protect themselves have been enabled by this legislation.
[2:47:50.400 --> 2:48:05.400]  What I do in one of the draft bills that I'm working on is build on that and say, alright, those people who come into the militia structures with concealed carry permits, the ones who have already been gone through the vetting and the FBI check and all the rest of this so we know they're not criminals or whatever,
[2:48:05.400 --> 2:48:22.400]  those people will be given further authority as some kind of deputy sheriff or deputy police or what have you, depending on the jurisdiction, so that they will now participate directly in crime control, crime deterrence, crime prevention, crime apprehension.
[2:48:22.400 --> 2:48:32.400]  So all of a sudden now, instead of having, you know, 50 police in Warren County where I live or 60 sheriff's deputies, it all of a sudden becomes 2,000 of them.
[2:48:32.400 --> 2:48:44.400]  And now we begin to expand not simply the concept that you have a right of self-protection, have a firearm for self-protection, but you can expand that right to participation in actual execution of the laws.
[2:48:44.400 --> 2:48:58.400]  And the posse is reborn. Let me bring up two sub points there. We have the demonization, though, of this ancient basic right, you know, going back to the Dutch or the Swiss or, you know, back to other nations before that of the local people in the village,
[2:48:58.400 --> 2:49:09.400]  you know, protecting their community. We have this federal demonization of the idea of militias or armed citizens. The monopoly of power can only be to the overarching federal super state.
[2:49:09.400 --> 2:49:21.400]  That's A, how do you deal with the fact that they try to create a taboo idea like it's pornography or something, and then a subset, they know this natural instinct for self-defense and individual control.
[2:49:21.400 --> 2:49:30.400]  So the feds are creating the false militia under Homeland Security and this million-man domestic security force federally directed with an anti-American agenda.
[2:49:30.400 --> 2:49:40.400]  Well, number one, I don't think that that is going to be successful. They're not going to be able to put that thing together, or to the extent they put something together, it's not going to be proved to be terribly functional.
[2:49:40.400 --> 2:49:49.400]  In terms of the demonization, I always ask somebody who looks sideways when I mention the word militia, I say, well, what other provisions of the Constitution do you disagree with?
[2:49:49.400 --> 2:49:55.400]  Yes. You know, you don't agree with the word militia, it says necessarily the free state. What kind of state do you want to live in?
[2:49:55.400 --> 2:50:02.400]  You know, you want to live in an unfree state? The Constitution has to, this is a statement of constitutional law. This isn't some kind of oratory pronouncement.
[2:50:02.400 --> 2:50:08.400]  This isn't some kind of an opinion of James Madison, but I take most of his opinions to be more or less correct.
[2:50:08.400 --> 2:50:14.400]  This is the great canon. This is the great canon. This is the great law. This is part of the great writ.
[2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:21.400]  That's right. It's part of the structure of our fundamental law, and it makes a declaration that I think is pretty emphatic.
[2:50:21.400 --> 2:50:26.400]  A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of free state. Just stop right there.
[2:50:26.400 --> 2:50:33.400]  If you don't have this structure, the Constitution itself is telling you, you in the long run are not going to live in a free state.
[2:50:33.400 --> 2:50:35.400]  What kind of state do you want to live in?
[2:50:35.400 --> 2:50:47.400]  And the right of the people. The people. The people. And who are they? We are the people. The people are us. We are the people.
[2:50:47.400 --> 2:50:51.400]  And if we don't have a right to be armed, we are slaves. Only slaves are disarmed.
[2:50:51.400 --> 2:50:57.400]  First gun laws against blacks, Native Americans, slaves are disarmed in Rome, slaves are disarmed in China.
[2:50:57.400 --> 2:51:01.400]  We'll be right back. Final segment with Dr. Edwin Vieira.
[2:51:01.400 --> 2:51:08.400]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[2:51:08.400 --> 2:51:12.400]  Are you safe when you walk to your car? Are your kids safe when they go out?
[2:51:12.400 --> 2:51:16.400]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[2:51:16.400 --> 2:51:20.400]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[2:51:20.400 --> 2:51:28.400]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[2:51:28.400 --> 2:51:33.400]  Need something more? The Stinger Keychain is a great way to surprise a potential attacker.

[2:52:01.400 --> 2:52:07.400]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:52:07.400 --> 2:52:11.400]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:52:11.400 --> 2:52:16.400]  Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:52:16.400 --> 2:52:24.400]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:52:24.400 --> 2:52:30.400]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[2:52:30.400 --> 2:52:34.400]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:34.400 --> 2:52:40.400]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:52:40.400 --> 2:52:45.400]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much much more.
[2:52:45.400 --> 2:52:54.400]  Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com. Or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:52:54.400 --> 2:52:58.400]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:53:01.400 --> 2:53:05.400]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off,

[2:53:10.400 --> 2:53:14.400]  and to help you and your families survive the global economic crash.
[2:53:14.400 --> 2:53:17.400]  Ready Reserve is offering the pre-inauguration special.

[2:54:27.400 --> 2:54:37.400]  This is The Great Contest. We've had tyranny breeding through the Central Bank and this nation for more than 90 years.
[2:54:37.400 --> 2:54:42.400]  Now they are attempting to fully overthrow the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution,
[2:54:42.400 --> 2:54:49.400]  the Declaration of Independence, our basic common law, the greatest ever developed by man in our history.
[2:54:49.400 --> 2:54:58.400]  You are defenders of the Republic. Stand with us. Become informed. Don't look for orders from headquarters.
[2:54:58.400 --> 2:55:06.400]  Get out there and take action. Or be usurped and enslaved. The choice is yours.
[2:55:06.400 --> 2:55:13.400]  Dr. Vieirov, we've got about four minutes left. You've got the floor.
[2:55:13.400 --> 2:55:18.400]  Any closing comments or points that you need to relay to the millions of viewers and listeners?
[2:55:18.400 --> 2:55:25.400]  Well, I'm glad you said don't take orders from headquarters because the opposite of that is, of course, we are the headquarters.
[2:55:25.400 --> 2:55:34.400]  We the people, three most important words in the Constitution. If we don't exercise self-governmental authority, then essentially everything is lost.
[2:55:34.400 --> 2:55:42.400]  And the only thing I would suggest to people, because I'm trying to get out, as I say this, a message on revitalizing what I consider to be one of,
[2:55:42.400 --> 2:55:48.400]  not the most important pillars of our constitutional structure, the militia of the several states, take a look at that book, Constitutional Homeland Security.
[2:55:48.400 --> 2:55:54.400]  As I say, it's on Amazon. And I hope Alex will end up being on one of your websites as well.
[2:55:54.400 --> 2:56:00.400]  And you're quarterbacking this. This is your great scholar. You've won three times in the Supreme Court.
[2:56:00.400 --> 2:56:06.400]  I mean, this is a great salvo in the Info War in the fight for liberty. People need to carry the ball.
[2:56:06.400 --> 2:56:13.400]  Well, that's right. First, they need to get informed. Take a look at the book, take a look at my columns on News with Views where I go into this in some detail,
[2:56:13.400 --> 2:56:22.400]  tying it into the banking and monetary system, become informed about these issues, decide for yourself whether this isn't something that's vitally important to be done.
[2:56:22.400 --> 2:56:35.400]  If you agree with me that it is, copy of the book, sit down with some of your neighbors over coffee, and begin discussing how you're going to implement a local plan to get those state legislators off the ball and moving in the right direction.
[2:56:35.400 --> 2:56:44.400]  Because that's the key. Get control over that local political structure. We can't control the federal government in Washington, D.C. at the present time.
[2:56:44.400 --> 2:56:56.400]  That's quite obvious. Our only alternative then is to work at the local level, the state level, and that kind of work will serve us in very good stead if we find the system coming down on our heads through economic breakdown.
[2:56:56.400 --> 2:57:06.400]  And, sir, that's why, for the listeners, that's why they're moving to totally federalize the states because they know that is the grassroots solution to remove this tyranny.
[2:57:06.400 --> 2:57:14.400]  And we have open foreign banks under war powers telling Congress that they're basically under martial law that's in mainstream newspapers now.
[2:57:14.400 --> 2:57:19.400]  This thing is so illegitimate, all we have to do is point out the emperor has no clothes.
[2:57:19.400 --> 2:57:26.400]  That's right. And the other side of that coin, though, of course, is that the window of opportunity that's open also will be closing.
[2:57:26.400 --> 2:57:33.400]  We will run out of time. We cannot sit on our hands indefinitely because we are the ones that will make it happen or it will not happen.
[2:57:33.400 --> 2:57:35.400]  That's the key.
[2:57:35.400 --> 2:57:39.400]  And even if they bring in tyranny and try to block all of this, that's just more evidence for folks.
[2:57:39.400 --> 2:57:47.400]  The founders for, as you know, committees of correspondence, the Sons of Liberty, tried for decades to fix things peaceably.
[2:57:47.400 --> 2:58:00.400]  Well, that's right. And, of course, that's my goal. We don't want to see the situation develop into any kind of violence, rioting, really that type of breakdown in social and economic affairs.
[2:58:00.400 --> 2:58:11.400]  But the only way to deter that or prevent that from happening is by the American people themselves reasserting control over this system from the grassroots up.
[2:58:11.400 --> 2:58:15.400]  That's the way we're going to avoid real chaos in this society.
[2:58:15.400 --> 2:58:21.400]  And anyone who thinks that that's not the key to it, I think you're living in a dream world, all history proves that.
[2:58:21.400 --> 2:58:29.400]  If the people themselves don't take control of their own government, then they're going to be subject to whatever terrible things others want to foist on.
[2:58:29.400 --> 2:58:34.400]  It is the law. It is the law of men, the law of nature, the law of nature's God.
[2:58:34.400 --> 2:58:38.400]  Dr. Edwin Vieira, we salute you and thank you for spending time with us.
[2:58:38.400 --> 2:58:39.400]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:58:39.400 --> 2:58:46.400]  Take care. Have a great new year.
[2:58:46.400 --> 2:58:51.400]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:51.400 --> 2:58:55.400]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[2:58:55.400 --> 2:59:00.400]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:59:00.400 --> 2:59:06.400]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:59:06.400 --> 2:59:09.400]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:59:09.400 --> 2:59:20.400]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:59:20.400 --> 2:59:25.400]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:59:25.400 --> 2:59:29.400]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:59:29.400 --> 2:59:32.400]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:59:32.400 --> 2:59:36.400]  People have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[2:59:36.400 --> 3:00:03.400]  Order in game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:00:06.400 --> 3:00:21.400]  All right. We are now already hard to believe into the final hour of this world-wide transmission.
[3:00:21.400 --> 3:00:27.400]  The websites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[3:00:27.400 --> 3:00:31.400]  This happens occasionally. We've had Professor Tosadosky on scores of times.
[3:00:31.400 --> 3:00:36.400]  His number is saying it's disconnected, so we're having some phone line issues.
[3:00:36.400 --> 3:00:41.400]  I'm getting him in Canada, but we'll get an alternate number.
[3:00:41.400 --> 3:00:45.400]  And from global research, we'll call their office.
[3:00:45.400 --> 3:00:48.400]  Or we can call the radio outfit he's on where they get the number there.
[3:00:48.400 --> 3:00:59.400]  But if not, we will just open the phones up in this hour and cover all the news, much of which I haven't even gotten to yet.
[3:00:59.400 --> 3:01:04.400]  I really want to take some time out now to commend the crew.
[3:01:04.400 --> 3:01:11.400]  I want to commend David. I want to commend Paul Hartman. I want to commend Jaren, the latest addition to our crew.
[3:01:11.400 --> 3:01:17.400]  I want to commend everybody here at the InfoWars Command Center in South Austin.
[3:01:17.400 --> 3:01:24.400]  And I want to thank all the AM and FM affiliates, global shortwave affiliates, everybody that makes this broadcast possible.
[3:01:24.400 --> 3:01:30.400]  And my team works very hard. It's very complex what we do here.
[3:01:30.400 --> 3:01:34.400]  And we're trying to learn. We're trying to make things better. We're trying to expand.
[3:01:34.400 --> 3:01:36.400]  And we put in a lot of long hours to bring in this information.
[3:01:36.400 --> 3:01:40.400]  And of course, I want to thank you, the listeners, the viewers of this radio show.
[3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:45.400]  When I say this, it's not to toot our horn. In fact, it's almost crushing.
[3:01:45.400 --> 3:01:50.400]  It's not daunting. It's booing that we're affecting so many people and reaching so many people.
[3:01:50.400 --> 3:02:00.400]  But it's also frightening in a way because to realize the responsibility we have that tens of millions of people,
[3:02:00.400 --> 3:02:06.400]  more than tens of millions, have seen my 21 films. Just so we can track on the web.
[3:02:06.400 --> 3:02:12.400]  And to know that tens of millions have tuned into my radio show and hundreds of millions on the thousands of radio interviews I've done.
[3:02:12.400 --> 3:02:14.400]  Hundreds of millions.
[3:02:14.400 --> 3:02:21.400]  Coast to coast, I am 16 million per show per evening. And I've been on that more than 100 times.
[3:02:21.400 --> 3:02:27.400]  And all the other radio shows and TV and Russian TV and British TV and Japanese TV and French television,
[3:02:27.400 --> 3:02:29.400]  Spanish television.
[3:02:29.400 --> 3:02:42.400]  Today, it's already aired in on their main TV station in on their main TV station in South Africa.
[3:02:42.400 --> 3:02:44.400]  In their major city.
[3:02:44.400 --> 3:02:46.400]  Capital city aired today.
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:48.400]  Endgame aired there.
[3:02:48.400 --> 3:02:54.400]  I had them air it for free. I don't charge. I just want to get the information out, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:02:54.400 --> 3:03:00.400]  And so we do have Professor Michelle Tossidowski. We'll come back to him after this quick break because we're almost out of time.
[3:03:00.400 --> 3:03:07.400]  I did want to just encourage at least once in this four hours today for folks to go to Infowars.com and financially support us
[3:03:07.400 --> 3:03:14.400]  because we've got to have financing somehow. Plus, these are great books and videos we carry and books I've written and other books and videos we carry.
[3:03:14.400 --> 3:03:21.400]  Like the Money Master. Three and a half hours long. You want a real master's degree in how the private federal reserve crime syndicate operates worldwide in the U.S.
[3:03:21.400 --> 3:03:25.400]  This is just unbelievably powerful and well done.
[3:03:25.400 --> 3:03:29.400]  And it's $19.95. It's like $25 bucks everywhere else I've seen it.
[3:03:29.400 --> 3:03:38.400]  Fabled enemies that I produce that Jason Bermas made our newest 9-11 film. It's into the Israeli connection and the phone companies and shadowing the terrorists and clearly involved
[3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:48.400]  and Barry Jennings who died, Joe Biden's in it, Mike Rivera, Bo Deedle, former NYPD detective, head of detectives, Michael J. Springman,
[3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:55.400]  Visa department, Jetta Saudi Arabia talking about the terrorists working for the CIA, Cynthia McKinney, former member of Congress.
[3:03:55.400 --> 3:04:01.400]  This is an important film right here and people need to see fabled enemies. It needs to get out.
[3:04:01.400 --> 3:04:05.400]  This is the DVD. This is the high quality digital. This is what folks need.
[3:04:05.400 --> 3:04:10.400]  I hope you'll all go there and if you've got the money, buy 10-15 copies. We've got discounts on them if you do.
[3:04:10.400 --> 3:04:14.400]  Get Truth Rising. Get In Game. Get Terror Storm.
[3:04:14.400 --> 3:04:19.400]  Get things like Mark Dice's book. Support him and our work. Resist this manifesto. Excellent book.

[3:04:25.400 --> 3:04:29.400]  So two films and an audio CD, 1995, The World According to Monsanto.
[3:04:29.400 --> 3:04:36.400]  It's got a little booklet inside of it as well. I mean, that's just some of what we're doing here and we need your support.

[3:08:01.400 --> 3:08:10.400]  Ease the T-Rex in political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:10.400 --> 3:08:21.400]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour after Professor Chassadowski leaves us breaking down the current geopolitical stuff going on in the Middle East and Israel with Gaza bombardment
[3:08:21.400 --> 3:08:25.400]  and the India-Pakistan situation. When I get his analysis on that, we respect it.
[3:08:25.400 --> 3:08:35.400]  Trans-Texas Corridor is dead. Text dot says KBUE Television, Austin, Texas. Now, I don't believe this for a minute.
[3:08:35.400 --> 3:08:39.400]  This is more possum playing, but the fact that they're having to do this is a big victory, so we'll talk about that.
[3:08:39.400 --> 3:08:47.400]  Let's go directly to Professor Chassadowski joining us from Canada. Works with, of course, GlobalResearch.ca.
[3:08:47.400 --> 3:08:56.400]  Sir, right now, your take on what is really unfolding in the world right now and is this Gaza situation the beginning of a wider conflict?
[3:08:56.400 --> 3:09:04.400]  Is this the unpopular move by Obama when he goes into office? Will he deploy U.S. troops in the Gaza Strip and other areas?
[3:09:04.400 --> 3:09:13.400]  Well, that's a very difficult question. I don't think that the United States is going to deploy troops.
[3:09:13.400 --> 3:09:28.400]  What is possible is that some of Israeli's Middle Eastern allies will participate in some kind of peacekeeping operation,
[3:09:28.400 --> 3:09:36.400]  which, in effect, is a form of interference. I'm thinking specifically of Turkey.
[3:09:36.400 --> 3:09:47.400]  Turkey and Israel have a very close military cooperation agreement. They exchange intelligence, they have joint military production.
[3:09:47.400 --> 3:09:59.400]  So a country like Turkey would be more likely to intervene and would, of course, also have some acceptance by the local Palestinian population
[3:09:59.400 --> 3:10:07.400]  who may, who are unaware of these military intelligence ties.
[3:10:07.400 --> 3:10:13.400]  The question is what kind of stance will the Obama administration take upon assuming office?
[3:10:13.400 --> 3:10:21.400]  I don't see a major shift in foreign policy. There may be a shift in rhetoric, but I don't see a major shift in foreign policy.
[3:10:21.400 --> 3:10:25.400]  What do you think the big surprise is, and then let's break down Gaza?
[3:10:25.400 --> 3:10:37.400]  Well, as you suggest, they now want to cut Gaza into several strips. It's a pretty small area to start with.
[3:10:37.400 --> 3:10:40.400]  It's siege. We see a siege going on.
[3:10:40.400 --> 3:10:53.400]  It's a siege. And as I pointed out in my earlier article, this siege has been on the drawing board for quite a number of years.
[3:10:53.400 --> 3:11:00.400]  And a number of events in recent history which have prepared for this siege.
[3:11:00.400 --> 3:11:09.400]  One was the assassination of Arafat, which led to this breakup of the Palestinian movement and Palestinian authority,
[3:11:09.400 --> 3:11:18.400]  but also the removal of all Jewish settlements from Gaza, which at the time, as you recall,
[3:11:18.400 --> 3:11:23.400]  was interpreted as a so-called victory for the Palestinian people.
[3:11:23.400 --> 3:11:29.400]  And it was part of the so-called roadmap, the U.S.-sponsored roadmap to peace, et cetera, et cetera.
[3:11:29.400 --> 3:11:39.400]  But in effect, what it was, was to create a prison territory, which you could not do if you had Jewish settlements on the inside of the prison.
[3:11:39.400 --> 3:11:48.400]  So they had to, in a sense, they had to remove those settlements, and as a result now, that territory is surrounded.
[3:11:48.400 --> 3:11:58.400]  It is an encampment. It's barricaded. But people are resisting. We have evidence of that.
[3:11:58.400 --> 3:12:10.400]  I think, of course, what bothers us tremendously is the grip that Anglo-American, but I would say mainly American,
[3:12:10.400 --> 3:12:14.400]  because now in Europe this seems to be a slightly different slant.
[3:12:14.400 --> 3:12:22.400]  But the grip that the U.S. media has on public opinion, where they present this invasion, the killings of civilians,
[3:12:22.400 --> 3:12:38.400]  the children, the use of prohibited weapons, they present this as legitimate retribution for the actions of Hamas,
[3:12:38.400 --> 3:12:48.400]  the rocket attack, without understanding the whole context, and without understanding the asymmetry and the loss of life.
[3:12:48.400 --> 3:12:53.400]  Okay, we're talking about 17 deaths in Israel over the last seven years.
[3:12:53.400 --> 3:12:59.400]  And if you look on the Palestinian side over the same period, talking about more than 1,000.
[3:12:59.400 --> 3:13:06.400]  But people don't seem to be, they don't seem to understand that.
[3:13:06.400 --> 3:13:11.400]  There's been 40 plus at the UN school alone today.
[3:13:11.400 --> 3:13:19.400]  Yes, absolutely, absolutely. And they're bombing schools, hospitals, universities.
[3:13:19.400 --> 3:13:32.400]  And if this were to happen anywhere else in the world, it would be, you know, you'd already have a war crime tribunal set up and so on and so forth.
[3:13:32.400 --> 3:13:43.400]  Now, the people who are now suggesting, Francis Boyle, Professor of Law, a good friend and colleague of mine,
[3:13:43.400 --> 3:13:58.400]  who is now suggesting the formation of a war crime tribunal to try the Israeli war criminals and the U.S. counterparts.
[3:13:58.400 --> 3:14:03.400]  Because this is not, this is not strictly an Israeli operation.
[3:14:03.400 --> 3:14:06.400]  This is an international colonial operation.
[3:14:06.400 --> 3:14:13.400]  And by the way, Mr. Boyle, who we've interviewed many times, he's written international treaties for the United States in the U.N.
[3:14:13.400 --> 3:14:15.400]  So he's very prestigious to be saying that.
[3:14:15.400 --> 3:14:25.400]  Absolutely, yes. No, he's a very distinguished lawyer and he has taken a stance on Palestine for quite a number of years.
[3:14:25.400 --> 3:14:40.400]  But what I think what people have to understand is that this operation is part of a plan which was established in the early 90s under the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
[3:14:40.400 --> 3:14:44.400]  In fact, in 2001, the 1948 option.
[3:14:44.400 --> 3:14:59.400]  Well, there was a 1948 option, which is to expel Palestinians, but the actual process of attacking the territories, breaking them up,
[3:14:59.400 --> 3:15:07.400]  establishing proxy regimes was part of a plan which was called Justified Vengeance.
[3:15:07.400 --> 3:15:12.400]  The title is interesting, Justified Operation Justified Vengeance.
[3:15:12.400 --> 3:15:17.400]  Now, Operation Justified Vengeance was launched in 2001.
[3:15:17.400 --> 3:15:26.400]  It was presented just after accession of Ariel Sharon to the position of Prime Minister.
[3:15:26.400 --> 3:15:35.400]  It was presented by the Chief of Staff of the so-called Israeli Defense Forces under the title, quote,
[3:15:35.400 --> 3:15:44.400]  the destruction of the Palestinian Authority and the disarmament of all armed forces, but the term Justified Vengeance was there.
[3:15:44.400 --> 3:15:49.400]  And it was commented at the time, even by the U.S. press.
[3:15:49.400 --> 3:16:10.400]  And then we understood that this plan was, in fact, it was designed by Mayor Dagan, and Mayor Dagan was the National Security Advisor to Ariel Sharon during his election campaign.
[3:16:10.400 --> 3:16:15.400]  He was then promoted to heading Mossad.
[3:16:15.400 --> 3:16:26.400]  So here's the current head of Mossad. They actually call him Dagan the gun, the top gun.
[3:16:26.400 --> 3:16:30.400]  He's the top spy of Israel.
[3:16:30.400 --> 3:16:36.400]  And so this Operation Justified Vengeance is also referred to as the Dagan Plan.
[3:16:36.400 --> 3:16:50.400]  And the whole idea of the Dagan Plan of Operation Justified Vengeance is to say, we need the suicide attacks so that we can then enter on acts of retribution,
[3:16:50.400 --> 3:16:55.400]  so that they would actually time, they would do scenarios.
[3:16:55.400 --> 3:16:58.400]  They say, okay, there's going to be a suicide attack.
[3:16:58.400 --> 3:17:13.400]  We want those suicide attacks to occur because then it gives us the pretext and the legitimacy to bomb Gaza or the West Bank, you know, and we can use F-16s.
[3:17:13.400 --> 3:17:20.400]  And they started using F-16s jets at the outset of the Dagan Plan.
[3:17:20.400 --> 3:17:26.400]  So what's happening today is very much part of a broader agenda.
[3:17:26.400 --> 3:17:35.400]  Now, I recall that, I mean, we've published several pieces on this Dagan Plan of Operation Justified Vengeance.
[3:17:35.400 --> 3:17:38.400]  Now, you've been reporting on it for years. You've been very concerned.
[3:17:38.400 --> 3:17:46.400]  Absolutely. And the thing is, I went back to some of the writings that we had published, including the writings of Tanya Reinhardt,
[3:17:46.400 --> 3:17:50.400]  who is the professor of linguistics at Tel Aviv University.
[3:17:50.400 --> 3:18:01.400]  She's actually a student of Noam Chomsky at MIT, and she died on the very mysterious circumstances a few years ago at age 50 or so.
[3:18:01.400 --> 3:18:03.400]  And she predicted very well.
[3:18:03.400 --> 3:18:10.400]  Oh, absolutely. I mean, she looked into the whole issue of this Dagan operation.
[3:18:10.400 --> 3:18:22.400]  There were other analysts, but essentially what was envisaged was an invasion of Palestinian-controlled territory by some 30,000 Israeli soldiers.
[3:18:22.400 --> 3:18:27.400]  Now, they won't be able to do it with 30,000. They'll need much more than that.
[3:18:27.400 --> 3:18:34.400]  But the fact is that back in 2001, there was already an invasion plan.
[3:18:34.400 --> 3:18:43.400]  It was already a process of, well, yeah, they wanted to disarm Hamas, but I think they also wanted to trigger a humanitarian disaster,
[3:18:43.400 --> 3:18:50.400]  with a view to ultimately triggering the expulsion of the Palestinian population.
[3:18:50.400 --> 3:18:56.400]  And where will they allow them to flee to? Because Egypt isn't letting them in. Will they flee to the sea?
[3:18:56.400 --> 3:19:04.400]  They could flee to Jordan. They could flee to Egypt. They could come to some agreement with Egyptians, because these are allies.
[3:19:04.400 --> 3:19:07.400]  Egypt and Jordan are allies of Israel.
[3:19:07.400 --> 3:19:23.400]  So, again, I don't want to make any predictions, but I'm just saying this 1948, as you said, the 1948 solution is expulsion.
[3:19:23.400 --> 3:19:32.400]  And it looks that they are creating conditions so horrendous that people can simply not survive within their homeland.
[3:19:32.400 --> 3:19:35.400]  I think that is the situation.
[3:19:35.400 --> 3:19:41.400]  Well, this is total seeds cutting off the three major cities and circling them with troops into the ocean, gunboats,
[3:19:41.400 --> 3:19:46.400]  and then blasting all their tunnels they were bringing in emergency supplies.
[3:19:46.400 --> 3:19:55.400]  So they're completely cut off and under heavy bombardment with their infrastructure, telecommunications, limited water and electrical systems being destroyed.
[3:19:55.400 --> 3:20:23.400]  You have this giant high-tech military doing this, but in our media, it's good.

[3:21:00.400 --> 3:21:07.400]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[3:21:07.400 --> 3:21:12.400]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical,
[3:21:12.400 --> 3:21:15.400]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[3:21:15.400 --> 3:21:21.400]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt,
[3:21:21.400 --> 3:21:23.400]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[3:21:23.400 --> 3:21:28.400]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[3:21:28.400 --> 3:21:33.400]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[3:21:33.400 --> 3:21:38.400]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[3:21:48.400 --> 3:21:51.400]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[3:22:00.400 --> 3:22:07.400]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[3:22:07.400 --> 3:22:10.400]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[3:22:10.400 --> 3:22:14.400]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? Was it engineered by you?
[3:22:14.400 --> 3:22:17.400]  David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF.
[3:22:17.400 --> 3:22:26.400]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[3:22:26.400 --> 3:22:32.400]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:22:32.400 --> 3:22:36.400]  An inside job? How dare you?
[3:22:36.400 --> 3:22:43.400]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:22:43.400 --> 3:22:46.400]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:22:46.400 --> 3:22:51.400]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of...

[3:23:00.400 --> 3:23:09.400]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[3:23:09.400 --> 3:23:14.400]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[3:23:14.400 --> 3:23:22.400]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron.
[3:23:22.400 --> 3:23:26.400]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[3:23:26.400 --> 3:23:32.400]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[3:23:32.400 --> 3:23:38.400]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.

[3:24:15.400 --> 3:24:31.400]  Professor Chossadosky will be with us until about 40 after. I'm going to break down some new developing news.
[3:24:31.400 --> 3:24:38.400]  We're going to talk a little bit more about geopolitically what's happening with the military in this short segment.
[3:24:38.400 --> 3:24:46.400]  Then for a few more minutes after, I'm going to get into the economic situation, which is Professor Chossadosky's real specialty in a conference they're having.
[3:24:46.400 --> 3:24:49.400]  So it's coming up in the next segment.
[3:24:49.400 --> 3:24:55.400]  Okay, Professor, India, Pakistan, that clearly was staged. A lot of evidence to that effect.
[3:24:55.400 --> 3:25:00.400]  General Hamid Ghul on others to cover that a few weeks ago.
[3:25:00.400 --> 3:25:05.400]  I want to get into that briefly, but first, putting a bow on this monstrosity.
[3:25:05.400 --> 3:25:14.400]  How do you see it unfolding? How many months will the siege go before they break the back and try to start expelling the people there in Gaza?
[3:25:14.400 --> 3:25:19.400]  That's very difficult to see at the moment.
[3:25:19.400 --> 3:25:28.400]  If we recall back in 1999, the aerial bombardment of Yugoslavia went on for several months.
[3:25:28.400 --> 3:25:39.400]  It started in March and they finished in June. I don't think that this operation will go on for a very long time.
[3:25:39.400 --> 3:25:47.400]  There's going to be urban warfare, but it's very difficult to predict.
[3:25:47.400 --> 3:26:03.400]  It's very difficult to predict because the Israelis are completely off onto something which is diabolical and they want to carry it through, and they believe that they're right.
[3:26:03.400 --> 3:26:09.400]  They have this self-righteousness.
[3:26:09.400 --> 3:26:14.400]  I'm not providing a very coherent answer to a question.
[3:26:14.400 --> 3:26:21.400]  We've already seen more than 1,000 injured. What is it up to 500 dead now? That's probably conservative numbers.
[3:26:21.400 --> 3:26:27.400]  How many is just going to go on and on? Israel doesn't care.
[3:26:27.400 --> 3:26:34.400]  I saw a London Guardian article saying Obama doesn't know this is destroying his name. His silence, of course Obama knows.
[3:26:34.400 --> 3:26:40.400]  Obama, his administration is headed up by a known Israeli operative IDF person.
[3:26:40.400 --> 3:26:47.400]  Absolutely. Obama is saying that he cannot act until he's President of the United States.
[3:26:47.400 --> 3:26:54.400]  I don't think that he would act any differently. There might be a little bit of rhetoric thrown in.
[3:26:54.400 --> 3:26:59.400]  He weighs in on everything else.
[3:26:59.400 --> 3:27:01.400]  That's true.
[3:27:01.400 --> 3:27:09.400]  He's commenting on every other issue. What do you expect Obama stands to be once he's in there, January 20th?
[3:27:09.400 --> 3:27:16.400]  I think that Obama is very clearly aligned with an Israeli Zionist agenda.
[3:27:16.400 --> 3:27:25.400]  That's very clear. In terms of the people he's appointed, in terms of his links to APAC,
[3:27:25.400 --> 3:27:39.400]  at the same time he has this ability to present himself as a humanitarian spokesperson.
[3:27:39.400 --> 3:27:47.400]  Some people have said that he is presenting a double image.
[3:27:47.400 --> 3:27:57.400]  In reality, what he's doing is continuity. It's the continuity of the Bush administration, its continuity in foreign policy.
[3:27:57.400 --> 3:28:09.400]  He's keeping on Gates as a sector of defense, which means that in effect there's not going to be any major upheaval in the military.
[3:28:09.400 --> 3:28:18.400]  They're passing the baton, but as Kissinger said on CNBC yesterday, the great image of him in the world, we're going to be able to really get our agenda through with Obama.
[3:28:18.400 --> 3:28:21.400]  He's cynically admitting it.
[3:28:21.400 --> 3:28:36.400]  Absolutely. That is the whole idea. You get Obama, who is an African American, who has the rhetoric to appeal to grassroots opinion in America,
[3:28:36.400 --> 3:28:46.400]  who has the support of people in Africa, because he has historical links to Kenya, and provides an image.
[3:28:46.400 --> 3:28:56.400]  But that image is false. I'm trying to find a polite word, but it is phony. It's a phony image.
[3:28:56.400 --> 3:28:59.400]  It's the nice guy, it was a bad guy.
[3:28:59.400 --> 3:29:11.400]  It's a cloaking device. Bush, at least you could say he's more sincere, because his image fits his top description.
[3:29:11.400 --> 3:29:14.400]  He's very, very arrogant and just said, I don't care.
[3:29:14.400 --> 3:29:23.400]  Yeah, he says, I don't care, but Obama will say deep down, he said, I don't care, but up front he'll say something else.
[3:29:23.400 --> 3:29:32.400]  So yeah, it's the policy of deceit, and people didn't vote for that. They voted for the rhetoric.
[3:29:32.400 --> 3:29:35.400]  They voted because they thought that this was...
[3:29:35.400 --> 3:29:39.400]  Stay there. Let's talk about India, Pakistan, and then the economy briefly when we get back.
[3:29:39.400 --> 3:29:41.400]  All right, stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:29:41.400 --> 3:29:44.400]  Professor Michelle Chassadowski is our guest.
[3:29:44.400 --> 3:29:58.400]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:15.400 --> 3:30:19.400]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[3:30:19.400 --> 3:30:23.400]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[3:30:23.400 --> 3:30:27.400]  The insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[3:30:27.400 --> 3:30:32.400]  Phase one is a one-world currency, which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[3:30:32.400 --> 3:30:36.400]  Phase two of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.
[3:30:36.400 --> 3:30:46.400]  Go to www.foodshortagesusa.com for the details. That's www.foodshortagesusa.com to learn how to prepare for the unthinkable.
[3:30:46.400 --> 3:30:51.400]  Don't wait for empty shelves. Learn how to make your own survival foods for pennies on the dollar.

[3:31:01.400 --> 3:31:08.400]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:31:08.400 --> 3:31:12.400]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[3:31:12.400 --> 3:31:14.400]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[3:31:14.400 --> 3:31:17.400]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:31:17.400 --> 3:31:24.400]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:31:24.400 --> 3:31:31.400]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:31:31.400 --> 3:31:35.400]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:31:35.400 --> 3:31:42.400]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[3:31:42.400 --> 3:31:46.400]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.
[3:31:46.400 --> 3:31:54.400]  Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:31:54.400 --> 3:32:20.400]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[3:32:25.400 --> 3:32:34.400]  If you want to prepare now, go to beforeitstoolake.us. That's beforeitstoolake.us.
[3:32:34.400 --> 3:32:40.400]  Or call 1-800-753-1981. That's 1-800-753-1981.
[3:32:40.400 --> 3:32:44.400]  Or you can put your head in the sand and be just another sheeple in the corporate controlled flock.
[3:32:44.400 --> 3:32:48.400]  But remember, those who don't learn from history are bound to repeat it.
[3:32:48.400 --> 3:33:00.260]  You and my transporting
[3:33:00.260 --> 3:33:24.060]  Moving quickly here in our final segment with Professor Chastadosky, the India-Pakistan
[3:33:24.060 --> 3:33:30.860]  situation four weeks ago from your research, your group of researchers analysis, do you
[3:33:30.860 --> 3:33:39.140]  see the same footprints of an orchestrated, staged, provocateur event?
[3:33:39.140 --> 3:33:41.060]  You're talking about, I'm sorry.
[3:33:41.060 --> 3:33:42.060]  The Mumbai attacks.
[3:33:42.060 --> 3:33:44.060]  Yes, of course, the Mumbai attacks.
[3:33:44.060 --> 3:33:54.060]  Well, the Mumbai attacks was, I think, certainly a staged event.
[3:33:54.060 --> 3:34:06.060]  It was intended to push Pakistan and India against one another.
[3:34:06.060 --> 3:34:12.060]  It was perpetrated, I believe it was an intelligence operation.
[3:34:12.060 --> 3:34:22.060]  The alleged terror groups behind these attacks are supported by Pakistani intelligence.
[3:34:22.060 --> 3:34:27.060]  The ISI, which in turn is in liaison with the CIA.
[3:34:27.060 --> 3:34:36.060]  I think the purpose of these attacks was, in fact, to create a situation of conflict
[3:34:36.060 --> 3:34:41.060]  between two countries, which in recent months were actually moving together again.
[3:34:41.060 --> 3:34:47.060]  And we saw the fake phone call, but they confirmed with the caller ID from, so it wasn't a fake
[3:34:47.060 --> 3:34:52.060]  call, they claimed that, from the Indian foreign ministry to the Pakistani government saying,
[3:34:52.060 --> 3:34:54.060]  we're going to attack you.
[3:34:54.060 --> 3:34:58.060]  And then it almost caused a conflict and now the troops are massing right when they were
[3:34:58.060 --> 3:34:59.060]  coming to reconciliation.
[3:34:59.060 --> 3:35:04.060]  You have all the intelligence operatives involved leading other terror attacks.
[3:35:04.060 --> 3:35:05.060]  Absolutely.
[3:35:05.060 --> 3:35:07.060]  Where do you see that going in the future?
[3:35:07.060 --> 3:35:17.060]  Well, again, right from the outset of this event, Pakistan has started to mass troops
[3:35:17.060 --> 3:35:19.060]  along its border.
[3:35:19.060 --> 3:35:29.060]  Again, it's very difficult to predict what might happen.
[3:35:29.060 --> 3:35:31.060]  But we're in very interesting times.
[3:35:31.060 --> 3:35:36.060]  Yes, we're in very uncertain times.
[3:35:36.060 --> 3:35:43.060]  But on the other hand, in both countries, there are people who understand these events.
[3:35:43.060 --> 3:35:49.060]  In Pakistan, there are people in the government who understand that their own intelligence
[3:35:49.060 --> 3:35:57.060]  agencies are, in fact, involved in sabotaging the political process.
[3:35:57.060 --> 3:36:05.060]  When I was reviewing the situation in Pakistan, one thing that came to my attention was that
[3:36:05.060 --> 3:36:13.060]  the State of Pakistani intelligence was appointed with approval of United States bypassing the
[3:36:13.060 --> 3:36:17.060]  civilian administration, bypassing the government.
[3:36:17.060 --> 3:36:20.060]  And they had a whole series of military appointments.
[3:36:20.060 --> 3:36:24.060]  Yeah, there's multiple governments within Pakistan itself.
[3:36:24.060 --> 3:36:28.060]  In closing, in the three or four minutes we've got left with you, Professor, give us your
[3:36:28.060 --> 3:36:32.060]  basic hold-down on the economy, where it's going, the banks openly announcing world
[3:36:32.060 --> 3:36:37.060]  government of and by the made-off-type banks, saying we'll pay carbon taxes to them.
[3:36:37.060 --> 3:36:40.060]  Break that down and tell us about the conference coming up.
[3:36:40.060 --> 3:36:45.060]  Well, it's easier for me to tell you about the conference in a very short period of time.
[3:36:45.060 --> 3:36:47.060]  We're organizing an event.
[3:36:47.060 --> 3:36:53.060]  It's the Center for Research on Globalization, which is based in Montreal, downtown Montreal.
[3:36:53.060 --> 3:37:01.060]  We're organizing an event next Wednesday of next week, sorry, the 14th of January.
[3:37:01.060 --> 3:37:05.060]  And the topic is on the financial crisis.
[3:37:05.060 --> 3:37:08.060]  I will be the main speaker at that event.
[3:37:08.060 --> 3:37:11.060]  And folks can find out more at globalresearch.ca.
[3:37:11.060 --> 3:37:20.060]  Yeah, go to globalresearch.ca that details as to where the event is being held.
[3:37:20.060 --> 3:37:24.060]  And you can always contact us by email.
[3:37:24.060 --> 3:37:26.060]  I know that a number of people are coming from out of town.
[3:37:26.060 --> 3:37:30.060]  Okay, but in closing, in the few minutes, I've got three minutes left here, and we're going to move on.
[3:37:30.060 --> 3:37:32.060]  We appreciate your time with us.
[3:37:32.060 --> 3:37:35.060]  Briefly, the world economic crisis in two minutes.
[3:37:35.060 --> 3:37:45.060]  Well, in two minutes, I'd focus on one issue which has not been addressed in any meaningful way, even by the critics,
[3:37:45.060 --> 3:37:53.060]  is that the handouts under the bailouts, the various bailouts, not only the 700 billion, okay?
[3:37:53.060 --> 3:38:07.060]  We're talking about something of the order of $8.5 trillion of handouts and loans secured by the Treasury or the Federal Reserve.
[3:38:07.060 --> 3:38:11.060]  Now, what this implies is the following.
[3:38:11.060 --> 3:38:15.060]  We're going to have a massive increase in the public debt.
[3:38:15.060 --> 3:38:21.060]  In the United States, the public debt stands as something like $14 trillion, okay?
[3:38:21.060 --> 3:38:31.060]  But just if you look at the numbers, the public debt could increase by 25% overnight.
[3:38:31.060 --> 3:38:37.060]  And this is occurring at a time when interest rates are virtually flat zero.
[3:38:37.060 --> 3:38:45.060]  So who's going to want to buy government bonds and Treasury bills when they're only going to get barely maybe 1% or even less,
[3:38:45.060 --> 3:38:54.060]  so that you're in a situation where you need to finance these handouts to the banks, you need to increase the public debt.
[3:38:54.060 --> 3:39:02.060]  And to increase the public debt, you have to borrow from the banks while the recipients of the bailouts, okay?
[3:39:02.060 --> 3:39:05.060]  They're borrowing their own money and we're paying for it.
[3:39:05.060 --> 3:39:06.060]  Exactly.
[3:39:06.060 --> 3:39:09.060]  They get the money and we pay to give them the money.
[3:39:09.060 --> 3:39:10.060]  Exactly.
[3:39:10.060 --> 3:39:21.060]  And the other aspect of this is that if you can't finance the deficit through the mission of public debt,
[3:39:21.060 --> 3:39:27.060]  you have to start splashing expenditures, every single category of expenditures,
[3:39:27.060 --> 3:39:32.060]  and you have to start privatizing government state assets and so on.
[3:39:32.060 --> 3:39:35.060]  I suspect that is what's going to happen.
[3:39:35.060 --> 3:39:43.060]  The irony is that those who are receiving the handouts are those who are also imposing the conditions as creditors of the state.
[3:39:43.060 --> 3:39:51.060]  So the state, the U.S. government is financing its own indebtedness at the expense of taxpayers.
[3:39:51.060 --> 3:39:53.060]  Yeah, let's simplify that in closing.
[3:39:53.060 --> 3:39:57.060]  It's so simple, it's hard for my mind to even grasp.
[3:39:57.060 --> 3:40:01.060]  The private banks engineer this, then they say you've got to give us money to get credit flowing to Main Street.
[3:40:01.060 --> 3:40:04.060]  They don't give any of it to Main Street to purposefully implode it.
[3:40:04.060 --> 3:40:10.060]  Then they give themselves 8.5 trillion just in the U.S. alone, tens of trillions worldwide from all the private central banks.
[3:40:10.060 --> 3:40:13.060]  But that's all backed up with taxpayer money.
[3:40:13.060 --> 3:40:20.060]  So we are going to pay them interest to give them the money to take over our economy.
[3:40:20.060 --> 3:40:21.060]  Exactly.
[3:40:21.060 --> 3:40:25.060]  Well, they are the brokers of the U.S. public debt.
[3:40:25.060 --> 3:40:30.060]  They don't hold all of the U.S. public debt, but they are brokers, but they are also creditors.
[3:40:30.060 --> 3:40:44.060]  So that in effect, they are the recipients of the handouts and they are the creditors of the state to finance the money that they are going to receive.
[3:40:44.060 --> 3:40:57.060]  So we're in a circular situation where the government is financing its own indebtedness through the handouts to the banks who are also the creditors and the brokers of public debt and treasury bills.
[3:40:57.060 --> 3:41:02.060]  So this is a corporate hijacking, a corporate looting, a total takeover.
[3:41:02.060 --> 3:41:03.060]  Absolutely.
[3:41:03.060 --> 3:41:04.060]  Absolutely.
[3:41:04.060 --> 3:41:05.060]  It's very serious.
[3:41:05.060 --> 3:41:17.060]  So in any event, if people from the United States wish to join us in Montreal, it's only about an hour from the border, less than an hour from the New York State and New Hampshire.
[3:41:17.060 --> 3:41:23.060]  Drive up to Montreal and we will be very happy to receive anybody who comes from the United States.
[3:41:23.060 --> 3:41:24.060]  Well, I wish I could join you.
[3:41:24.060 --> 3:41:25.060]  We also have a lot of listeners on.
[3:41:25.060 --> 3:41:30.060]  Well, you're a bit far off, but we'll, okay.
[3:41:30.060 --> 3:41:31.060]  Well, thank you.
[3:41:31.060 --> 3:41:32.060]  Take care.
[3:41:32.060 --> 3:41:33.060]  Take care, Alex.
[3:41:33.060 --> 3:41:35.060]  Greetings to everybody in Texas.
[3:41:35.060 --> 3:41:36.060]  All right.
[3:41:36.060 --> 3:41:37.060]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[3:41:37.060 --> 3:41:38.060]  Take care.
[3:41:38.060 --> 3:41:39.060]  There goes the professor.
[3:41:39.060 --> 3:41:40.060]  Yeah.
[3:41:40.060 --> 3:41:43.060]  Well, we have been making that point over and over and over again.
[3:41:43.060 --> 3:41:52.060]  And we made the point before the banker takeover bill that it was a banker takeover bill because the bill said it, total martial law, private foreign banks openly owning and running the government.
[3:41:52.060 --> 3:41:59.060]  This is bitch to complain to even Federal Reserve board governors in the United States have gone to the news and said, this is foreign banks.
[3:41:59.060 --> 3:42:05.060]  This isn't even, you know, local governors of the Federal Reserve who were just titular heads over the private banks.
[3:42:05.060 --> 3:42:07.060]  We're not even allowed to look at what's going on.
[3:42:07.060 --> 3:42:12.060]  We've been told we're under martial law and we've had Congressmen on the show to tell you that as well.
[3:42:12.060 --> 3:42:14.060]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[3:42:14.060 --> 3:42:16.060]  I always say that because you can't.
[3:42:16.060 --> 3:42:18.060]  This is totally insane.
[3:42:18.060 --> 3:42:24.060]  This is absolutely, totally and completely off the charts by every yardstick.
[3:42:24.060 --> 3:42:26.060]  This is nothing like this has ever been seen.
[3:42:26.060 --> 3:42:35.060]  Normally the big private central banks go into Nigeria or Costa Rica or Brazil or Asian countries.
[3:42:35.060 --> 3:42:38.060]  They've done hundreds and hundreds, sometimes over and over again, the same nation.
[3:42:38.060 --> 3:42:44.060]  And they'll go, here's a billion bucks paid for by American taxpayers, mainly about 60% of IMF World Bank money.
[3:42:44.060 --> 3:42:46.060]  But that's all just fiat as well.
[3:42:46.060 --> 3:42:50.060]  But it's backed up by the U.S. military.
[3:42:50.060 --> 3:42:52.060]  We'll give your corrupt dictator a billion bucks.
[3:42:52.060 --> 3:42:54.060]  He keeps it for himself, leaves.
[3:42:54.060 --> 3:42:58.060]  And 10 years later, the country's paid back 50 billion, but never even touched the interest.
[3:42:58.060 --> 3:43:02.060]  It's all interest, never getting down the principle.
[3:43:02.060 --> 3:43:04.060]  This is even worse.
[3:43:04.060 --> 3:43:11.060]  This is where the banks bankrupt everything, cut off equity to the public, have all the cash and liquidity hoarded to themselves.
[3:43:11.060 --> 3:43:15.060]  They openly buy up other banks' insurance companies.
[3:43:15.060 --> 3:43:22.060]  And buy off other corporations and other key infrastructure assets, mainly.
[3:43:22.060 --> 3:43:33.060]  And then we have to pay tax money to them for the private Federal Reserve giving itself all our money.
[3:43:33.060 --> 3:43:36.060]  I mean, that's just unbelievable.
[3:43:36.060 --> 3:43:42.060]  And that's the point I make every day, every day, every day here.
[3:43:42.060 --> 3:43:46.060]  The public thinks it's bad that they're taking all this money.
[3:43:46.060 --> 3:43:56.060]  We've got to pay it back in taxes, but they don't understand that the groups getting the money are the ones that we've got to pay interest to to give them the money.
[3:43:56.060 --> 3:44:10.060]  That'd be like if I had a car dealership and I sold you a $25,000 Mustang and I gave you the Mustang and I paid you $25,000 to give you the Mustang.
[3:44:10.060 --> 3:44:23.060]  Here, here's a Mustang, $25,000 brand new, fully loaded, and I'm giving it to you for free and I'm going to pay you $25,000 to take it for free.
[3:44:23.060 --> 3:44:32.060]  And then I'm the guy getting the free Mustang and the $25,000 and I'm going, you're lucky I'm doing this, you're lucky I'm taking care of, you're lucky I'm taking this.
[3:44:32.060 --> 3:44:38.060]  By the way, if you don't like me taking this, I got troops.
[3:44:38.060 --> 3:44:42.060]  Troops that literally have no idea what planet they're even on.
[3:44:42.060 --> 3:44:45.060]  Police that have no idea, a public that has no idea.
[3:44:45.060 --> 3:44:52.060]  And my concern is, if the scams are this crazy, this wild, this out in the open, what's coming next?
[3:44:52.060 --> 3:44:54.060]  What's the new outrageous?
[3:44:54.060 --> 3:44:59.060]  I mean, what more could they come up with?
[3:44:59.060 --> 3:45:02.060]  I want to get into this trans-Texas corridor is dead, Textot says.
[3:45:02.060 --> 3:45:05.060]  In fact, let's pull that up and just put it on screen for folks.
[3:45:05.060 --> 3:45:09.060]  Trans-Texas corridor is dead, Textot says.
[3:45:09.060 --> 3:45:11.060]  That just means they'll rename it, but I want to go over that.
[3:45:11.060 --> 3:45:18.060]  But before we do that, here is the newest film that I directed, Truth Rising.
[3:45:18.060 --> 3:45:21.060]  And it's indescribable, everything that it covers.
[3:45:21.060 --> 3:45:28.060]  I mean, it's police telling 9-11 truthers that they're going to plant bombs on them and saying that video cameras are guns and it's all these world leaders being confronted.
[3:45:28.060 --> 3:45:36.060]  And Joe Biden and John McCain and just Bill Clinton, David Rockefeller, the amazing worker, Luka Dowsky and everybody else.
[3:45:36.060 --> 3:45:38.060]  We are changing 9-11 truth groups around the nation.
[3:45:38.060 --> 3:45:40.060]  A lot of it's activist footage, a lot of it's our footage.
[3:45:40.060 --> 3:45:41.060]  This is my Cinema Verite.
[3:45:41.060 --> 3:45:43.060]  There's no voiceover.
[3:45:43.060 --> 3:45:46.060]  This is the most cinematically skillful film I've ever made.
[3:45:46.060 --> 3:45:49.060]  And it's a totally different angle on 9-11 truth.
[3:45:49.060 --> 3:45:51.060]  Arnold Schwarzenegger is confronted in here.
[3:45:51.060 --> 3:45:57.060]  So I hope that folks will go to MfoldWars.com, not just to get a great film for as low as 6.95 when you get a...
[3:45:57.060 --> 3:45:59.060]  get it with other videos.
[3:45:59.060 --> 3:46:01.060]  But it also supports us.
[3:46:01.060 --> 3:46:04.060]  And then you get something you can show others to wake them up.
[3:46:04.060 --> 3:46:05.060]  Endgame.
[3:46:05.060 --> 3:46:10.060]  This is now recognized by many as the preeminent overall film about world government, the New World Order.
[3:46:10.060 --> 3:46:12.060]  The best produced, the most information.
[3:46:12.060 --> 3:46:15.060]  Two and a half hours long with 40 minutes of extras.
[3:46:15.060 --> 3:46:19.060]  Prison Party.TV members get an hour and 40 minutes of extra extras called Endgame 1.5.
[3:46:19.060 --> 3:46:20.060]  But here it is.
[3:46:20.060 --> 3:46:22.060]  Alex Jones is Endgame.
[3:46:22.060 --> 3:46:25.060]  And blueprint for global enslavement.
[3:46:25.060 --> 3:46:32.060]  And I certainly do hope that everybody out there will go to MfoldWars.com and order these.
[3:46:32.060 --> 3:46:36.060]  Not just to get a powerful film to give us a gift to wake folks up, but also to financially support us in what we're doing.
[3:46:36.060 --> 3:46:37.060]  You can see we're upgrading.
[3:46:37.060 --> 3:46:38.060]  We're trying to expand.
[3:46:38.060 --> 3:46:42.060]  We're trying to be more effective, a little bit more glossy.
[3:46:42.060 --> 3:46:46.060]  And we're going to even improve things more in the future.
[3:46:46.060 --> 3:46:47.060]  But we need your support.
[3:46:47.060 --> 3:46:49.060]  And it goes right back into fighting the New World Order.
[3:46:49.060 --> 3:46:56.060]  So again, MfoldWars.com or you can call toll-free and ask about all the different combos and specials we've got.
[3:46:56.060 --> 3:47:00.060]  9-11 inside job, baseball caps as low as $5.95, t-shirts as low as $5.95.
[3:47:00.060 --> 3:47:02.060]  I mean, that's a cost, folks, for us.
[3:47:02.060 --> 3:47:04.060]  Yeah, it's a cost most of them.
[3:47:04.060 --> 3:47:06.060]  Some of them will make like $1.
[3:47:06.060 --> 3:47:08.060]  And every order gets a free Citizens Rulebook.
[3:47:08.060 --> 3:47:10.060]  The big orders get multiple copies.
[3:47:10.060 --> 3:47:17.060]  Find out more at MfoldWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[3:47:17.060 --> 3:47:19.060]  What's up, Paul?
[3:47:19.060 --> 3:47:20.060]  Oh, you got it.
[3:47:20.060 --> 3:47:23.060]  Go ahead and pop Trans-Texas Corridor up on the screen for folks.
[3:47:23.060 --> 3:47:29.060]  And I'll – yeah, that's another story out of – that's Ben Weir.
[3:47:29.060 --> 3:47:30.060]  What?
[3:47:30.060 --> 3:47:32.060]  That's out of the Austin American statesman.
[3:47:32.060 --> 3:47:33.060]  That's what I thought it was.
[3:47:33.060 --> 3:47:36.060]  I've got KVUE.
[3:47:36.060 --> 3:47:40.060]  That's the local ABC News affiliate as well with a similar headline.
[3:47:40.060 --> 3:47:42.060]  Trans-Texas Corridor is dead.
[3:47:42.060 --> 3:47:43.060]  Text.Sys.
[3:47:43.060 --> 3:47:48.060]  They told us two years ago that the toll roads were dead and the legislature passed a law
[3:47:48.060 --> 3:47:52.060]  saying they couldn't seize the roads and basically for one penny on the dollar or less
[3:47:52.060 --> 3:47:56.060]  give them to a foreign Spanish company.
[3:47:56.060 --> 3:48:01.060]  The media responded by saying, okay, the toll roads are all dead as they put them in
[3:48:01.060 --> 3:48:02.060]  and opened them.
[3:48:02.060 --> 3:48:05.060]  And Rick Perry said, I'm just ignoring all that.
[3:48:05.060 --> 3:48:07.060]  And they said they're no longer toll roads.
[3:48:07.060 --> 3:48:08.060]  These are not toll roads.
[3:48:08.060 --> 3:48:10.060]  These are pay-as-you-go lengths.
[3:48:10.060 --> 3:48:14.060]  So it's like Obama's chief of staff saying, well, you're going to have to serve in a
[3:48:14.060 --> 3:48:17.060]  new domestic military, 18 to 24, and for basic training and then we'll keep you longer if
[3:48:17.060 --> 3:48:18.060]  we want.
[3:48:18.060 --> 3:48:19.060]  You must do it under law.
[3:48:19.060 --> 3:48:20.060]  And they go, well, this is then mandatory.
[3:48:20.060 --> 3:48:21.060]  No, it's not mandatory.
[3:48:21.060 --> 3:48:22.060]  It's compulsory.
[3:48:22.060 --> 3:48:23.060]  Mandatory compulsory mean the same thing.
[3:48:23.060 --> 3:48:24.060]  Look them up.
[3:48:24.060 --> 3:48:26.060]  It's like saying, we don't want global government.
[3:48:26.060 --> 3:48:27.060]  We want global governance.
[3:48:27.060 --> 3:48:30.060]  Well, governance means the system of government.
[3:48:30.060 --> 3:48:41.060]  I mean, this is a joke.
[3:48:41.060 --> 3:48:47.060]  It's like saying, you know, look at the sky is blue and you say, no, that's not a sky.
[3:48:47.060 --> 3:48:48.060]  That's an atmosphere.
[3:48:48.060 --> 3:48:49.060]  Same thing.
[3:48:49.060 --> 3:48:50.060]  It's a game.
[3:48:50.060 --> 3:48:51.060]  It's a word play.
[3:48:51.060 --> 3:48:54.060]  That's like saying, I don't know.
[3:48:54.060 --> 3:49:00.060]  It's a game.
[3:49:00.060 --> 3:49:01.060]  It's a word play.
[3:49:01.060 --> 3:49:02.060]  That's like saying, that's a fire hydrant.
[3:49:02.060 --> 3:49:05.060]  Somebody goes, no, that's a fire plug.
[3:49:05.060 --> 3:49:06.060]  Whatever.
[3:49:06.060 --> 3:49:07.060]  Transsexist corridor is dead.
[3:49:07.060 --> 3:49:08.060]  This is absolutely not true.
[3:49:08.060 --> 3:49:13.060]  The national news, I've seen in clips in Fox saying, transsexist corridor doesn't exist.
[3:49:13.060 --> 3:49:14.060]  Ron Paul is insane.
[3:49:14.060 --> 3:49:16.060]  The official documents say it's part of the nap to superhighway.
[3:49:16.060 --> 3:49:18.060]  They say, hey, doesn't exist.
[3:49:18.060 --> 3:49:20.060]  But here it is.
[3:49:20.060 --> 3:49:21.060]  They're playing pause.
[3:49:21.060 --> 3:49:22.060]  Some of that at least means they're in a lot of trouble.
[3:49:22.060 --> 3:49:25.060]  And they're trying to get everybody to kind of go home and shut up.
[3:49:25.060 --> 3:49:29.060]  The Texas Department of Transportation announced this, and it's really a federal office this
[3:49:29.060 --> 3:49:33.060]  morning, that it has officially killed the transsexist corridor saying that despite the
[3:49:33.060 --> 3:49:37.060]  project's visionary aspects like stealing land 10 miles on every side of the roads,
[3:49:37.060 --> 3:49:38.060]  that's only one leg of it.
[3:49:38.060 --> 3:49:39.060]  It was 8,000 miles.
[3:49:39.060 --> 3:49:44.060]  It is clearly not the choice of Texans.
[3:49:44.060 --> 3:49:46.060]  What is that little lying statement?
[3:49:46.060 --> 3:49:49.060]  They've had Houston Chronicle polls and others 99%.
[3:49:49.060 --> 3:49:51.060]  Lou Dobbs had one 99%.
[3:49:51.060 --> 3:49:52.060]  They signed every polls.
[3:49:52.060 --> 3:49:53.060]  99% are against it.
[3:49:53.060 --> 3:49:54.060]  But what are these guys?
[3:49:54.060 --> 3:49:57.060]  I mean, it's just all lies.
[3:49:57.060 --> 3:50:00.060]  The Texas Department of Transportation announced this morning it has officially killed the
[3:50:00.060 --> 3:50:04.060]  transsexist corridor saying that despite the project's visionary aspects, it's clearly
[3:50:04.060 --> 3:50:07.060]  not the choice of Texans.
[3:50:07.060 --> 3:50:09.060]  Like I said, it is true.
[3:50:09.060 --> 3:50:10.060]  I was reading that wrong.
[3:50:10.060 --> 3:50:11.060]  They're meaning.
[3:50:11.060 --> 3:50:12.060]  Oh, wow, something actually truthful.
[3:50:12.060 --> 3:50:13.060]  I couldn't believe it.
[3:50:13.060 --> 3:50:14.060]  They're saying it's not the choice of Texans.
[3:50:14.060 --> 3:50:15.060]  DMN file.
[3:50:15.060 --> 3:50:18.060]  The announcement comes six years after Rick Perry shook up the state's transportation
[3:50:18.060 --> 3:50:23.060]  and political circles by unveiling an ambitious plan to stretch highway rail lines and utilities
[3:50:23.060 --> 3:50:24.060]  for hundreds of miles.
[3:50:24.060 --> 3:50:29.060]  It's 8,000 along Interstate 35 and Interstate 69 corridors, which is part of the Napa Super
[3:50:29.060 --> 3:50:32.060]  Highway corridors, 34 of them.
[3:50:32.060 --> 3:50:35.060]  The plan, which would cost tens of millions of dollars and relied heavily on private toll
[3:50:35.060 --> 3:50:37.060]  roads, was hugely controversial.
[3:50:37.060 --> 3:50:41.060]  Amandos Seniz, Executive Director of Textot, made the announcement that the agency was
[3:50:41.060 --> 3:50:44.060]  giving up on the idea of the annual transportation forum in Austin.
[3:50:44.060 --> 3:50:47.060]  Make no mistake, transsexist corridor, as we have known it no longer exists.
[3:50:47.060 --> 3:50:48.060]  There it is.
[3:50:48.060 --> 3:50:51.060]  Lawyers speak as we have known it.
[3:50:51.060 --> 3:50:53.060]  Right there.
[3:50:53.060 --> 3:50:56.060]  As we have known it.
[3:50:56.060 --> 3:50:57.060]  It's not.
[3:50:57.060 --> 3:50:58.060]  It's back.
[3:50:58.060 --> 3:50:59.060]  It's always going to be there.
[3:50:59.060 --> 3:51:25.060]  It's always going to be there.
[3:51:25.060 --> 3:51:51.060]  It's always going to be there.
[3:51:51.060 --> 3:52:17.060]  It's always going to be there.
[3:52:17.060 --> 3:52:46.060]  It's always going to be there.
[3:52:47.060 --> 3:53:07.060]  It's always going to be there.
[3:53:07.060 --> 3:53:35.060]  It's always going to be there.
[3:53:35.060 --> 3:54:01.060]  It's always going to be there.
[3:54:06.060 --> 3:54:13.060]  I want to finish up with some final news and tell you about some of the big cash we've
[3:54:13.060 --> 3:54:20.060]  got coming up this week.
[3:54:20.060 --> 3:54:25.060]  But before I do that, I want to tell you about one of the sponsors that makes this show possible.

[3:55:00.060 --> 3:55:03.060]  The difficult times we are about to experience.
[3:55:03.060 --> 3:55:06.060]  Heirloom seeds are the original varieties, non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[3:55:06.060 --> 3:55:08.060]  All their seeds date back over a century.
[3:55:08.060 --> 3:55:11.060]  Their Mayflower bean came over on the Mayflower ship.

[3:55:38.060 --> 3:55:39.060]  Dot.com.
[3:55:39.060 --> 3:55:44.060]  We got David Ike coming up for two hours on Thursday.
[3:55:44.060 --> 3:55:45.060]  We got Alan Watt for two hours.
[3:55:45.060 --> 3:55:46.060]  Those are popular guests.
[3:55:46.060 --> 3:55:50.060]  I always enjoy talking to them, riveting and insightful information and analysis.
[3:55:50.060 --> 3:55:54.060]  We got a lot of other very interesting and informative guests coming up this week as well.
[3:55:54.060 --> 3:55:56.060]  Jason Burmes is going to be here in town.
[3:55:56.060 --> 3:56:00.060]  He'll be sitting in some next week as well.
[3:56:00.060 --> 3:56:02.060]  So I look forward to that.
[3:56:02.060 --> 3:56:05.060]  I'm doing a new thing where I have a little pocket recorder.
[3:56:05.060 --> 3:56:06.060]  I've got to get a new one though.
[3:56:06.060 --> 3:56:09.060]  It turns out it's not compatible with our computers to dump it off.
[3:56:09.060 --> 3:56:12.060]  We're late at night when I'm kind of in a calm, reflective mode.
[3:56:12.060 --> 3:56:13.060]  I'm going to start doing recordings.
[3:56:13.060 --> 3:56:14.060]  We're up in the game.
[3:56:14.060 --> 3:56:15.060]  We're doing even more.
[3:56:15.060 --> 3:56:19.060]  I'm putting that up on infowars.com and that's going to be up in the next few hours as well.
[3:56:19.060 --> 3:56:24.060]  Definitely go check out the first time that we're launching that.
[3:56:24.060 --> 3:56:34.060]  All I can say is that I am very, very proud of the crew, the Genesis Network, the info wars network,
[3:56:34.060 --> 3:56:38.060]  everything that we are doing here.
[3:56:38.060 --> 3:56:45.060]  We reach more people when you spread the word about the show, the free podcasts, the free downloads,
[3:56:45.060 --> 3:56:49.060]  the free streams, your local AM and FM affiliates that a lot of you are tuning into.
[3:56:49.060 --> 3:56:51.060]  That's how we move the ball down the field.
[3:56:51.060 --> 3:56:52.060]  That's how we inform people.
[3:56:52.060 --> 3:56:55.060]  The solution is an awakening to what's happening.
[3:56:55.060 --> 3:56:58.060]  Then the globalists can't misdirect us and control us.
[3:56:58.060 --> 3:57:02.060]  Now, for four hours, my voice starts getting tired.
[3:57:02.060 --> 3:57:05.060]  Trans-Texas Corridor is dead, Text Dot says.
[3:57:05.060 --> 3:57:11.060]  But then the director of Text Dot, Amandio Sinez, executive director says,
[3:57:11.060 --> 3:57:15.060]  make no mistake, the Trans-Texas Corridor, as we have known it, no longer exists.
[3:57:15.060 --> 3:57:17.060]  See, as we have known it.
[3:57:17.060 --> 3:57:20.060]  Just like they said, we're not doing toll roads anymore and then they did them.
[3:57:20.060 --> 3:57:24.060]  They want you to all just drop your baseball bats, your mitts, leave the game.
[3:57:24.060 --> 3:57:25.060]  Oh, the game's over.
[3:57:25.060 --> 3:57:26.060]  You didn't hear?
[3:57:26.060 --> 3:57:27.060]  You know, the meeting was canceled.
[3:57:27.060 --> 3:57:29.060]  Local governments always try this.
[3:57:29.060 --> 3:57:31.060]  They know a public's coming in to protest something.
[3:57:31.060 --> 3:57:34.060]  They say, oh, we changed the meeting and they go ahead and have the meeting.
[3:57:34.060 --> 3:57:38.060]  Each of the dozens of projects that were linked together under the rubric of the TTC included
[3:57:38.060 --> 3:57:43.060]  the Loop 9 project in Dallas will remain as a standalone project, he said.
[3:57:43.060 --> 3:57:45.060]  So, did you hear that?
[3:57:45.060 --> 3:57:48.060]  They will, before I even read the article on air, I said, this is all bull.
[3:57:48.060 --> 3:57:49.060]  You just handed it to me.
[3:57:49.060 --> 3:57:52.060]  Just knocked my mic off to stand there.
[3:57:52.060 --> 3:57:54.060]  I'm kind of out of control here, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:57:54.060 --> 3:57:57.060]  And it says each of the dozens of projects that were linked together under the rubric of the TTC,
[3:57:57.060 --> 3:58:00.060]  including the Loop 9 project in Dallas and I-69 project in the south,
[3:58:00.060 --> 3:58:03.060]  will remain as standalone projects, he said.
[3:58:03.060 --> 3:58:07.060]  And he goes on to say it's been diminished, but we recognize the inevitability
[3:58:07.060 --> 3:58:10.060]  of the TTC is not the choice of Texas.
[3:58:10.060 --> 3:58:12.060]  So, they're saying we're going to do them all standalone.
[3:58:12.060 --> 3:58:17.060]  They're going to do them all separately, so it's harder to coordinate against it.
[3:58:17.060 --> 3:58:20.060]  Compartmentalization.
[3:58:20.060 --> 3:58:22.060]  Oh, my goodness.
[3:58:22.060 --> 3:58:24.060]  It's just so incredible.
[3:58:24.060 --> 3:58:25.060]  Get the word out.
[3:58:25.060 --> 3:58:27.060]  This is a fraud, a lie, a scam.
[3:58:27.060 --> 3:58:29.060]  Continue fighting all of these individual projects.
[3:58:29.060 --> 3:58:32.060]  We had a bunch of key guests up today.
[3:58:32.060 --> 3:58:38.060]  Re-broadcast with Mike Rivera, Edwin Vieira, Michael Chasidowski,
[3:58:38.060 --> 3:58:41.060]  it's all coming up one place, infowars.com with the restream right now.
[3:58:41.060 --> 3:59:03.060]  We'll be back in one minute.
