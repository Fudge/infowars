[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:11.000 --> 00:18.000]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:18.000 --> 00:41.000]  In the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:41.000 --> 00:51.000]  As Biden sleeps, the friendship between our two nations, the United States of America and the Jewish and Democratic State of Israel.
[00:51.000 --> 01:04.000]  Biden's headless administration continues to fumble the so-called mission in Afghanistan.
[01:04.000 --> 01:12.000]  How can you be sure any list you share of Afghans who helped Americans won't be used for horrendous reasons by the Haqqani Network or others?
[01:12.000 --> 01:21.000]  The idea that we've done anything to put at further risk those that were trying to help leave the country is simply wrong.
[01:21.000 --> 01:27.000]  And the idea that we shared lists of Americans or others with the Taliban is simply wrong.
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  When you're trying to get a bus or a group of people through and you need to show a manifest to do that,
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.000]  because particularly in cases where people don't have the necessary credentials on them or documents on them,
[01:37.000 --> 01:45.000]  then you'll share names of the list on people with a bus so they can be assured that those are people that we're looking to bring in.
[01:45.000 --> 01:54.000]  Treading water until the hostage situation inevitably begins as the Biden administration is solely responsible for leaving Americans behind.
[01:54.000 --> 02:02.000]  She said your son did not die in vain, but guess what? My son did die in vain. This was an unnecessary debacle.
[02:02.000 --> 02:10.000]  They could have been handled properly. They had months and months to remove everyone from Afghanistan and they chose not to.
[02:10.000 --> 02:16.000]  When I came into office, I inherited a deal that President Trump negotiated with the Taliban.
[02:16.000 --> 02:24.000]  Under his agreement, U.S. forces would be out of Afghanistan by May 1, 2021.
[02:24.000 --> 02:37.000]  The choice I had to make as your president was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban in the middle of the spring fighting season.
[02:37.000 --> 02:47.000]  As much as the left wants to blame Trump, it is abundantly clear that the Trump administration would have never bungled the evacuation as Biden has.
[02:47.000 --> 02:56.000]  Conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables, will guide our strategy from now on.
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  Mike Pompeo and President Trump have been very clear about this. Even the former Secretary of Defense have been very clear about this.
[03:00.000 --> 03:07.000]  There are requirements that had to be met. You watch time and again whenever the Taliban did not meet the requirement, there was ramifications for that.
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  Quick, swift, and very difficult.
[03:09.000 --> 03:18.000]  As the U.S. completes evacuation, defensive drone strikes involving questionable level targets were all the Biden administration could muster.
[03:18.000 --> 03:25.000]  Following this strike, CNN confirmed that nine members of one family, including six children, were killed in this drone strike.
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.000]  The real rescue teams were privately funded and courageously manned by veterans.
[03:30.000 --> 03:42.000]  The week-long secret operation dubbed Pineapple Express has been carried out by a group of special ops veterans, including retired Green Berets and SEAL team commanders.
[03:42.000 --> 03:51.000]  Are people being turned away and do you believe that those people who can get out and have the paperwork to get out will be able to get out after Americans' forces leave on Tuesday?
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.000]  I don't know if they're going to be able to get out. I have hope that they will.
[03:55.000 --> 04:07.000]  And I think that just seeing the way that our community flexed and was just learning on the fly and getting these people out from a situation that none of us had ever seen before,
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.000]  I think that the change in the operating environment of that airport being closed is not going to slow us down.
[04:12.000 --> 04:19.000]  I think we're going to find ways to continue to get people out. And this is very much not over on the 31st.
[04:19.000 --> 04:29.000]  Back at Dover Air Force Base, Joe Biden continued his role as Corruptor-in-Chief, clearly signaling that there is some place he would rather be.
[04:29.000 --> 04:39.000]  After Biden's historic, massive foreign policy failure, Hurricane Ida provides Biden with a platform to attempt to pivot into some semblance of responsibility.
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  But he managed to botch that too.
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  I'm not supposed to take any questions, but go ahead.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  I'm not going to answer Gaston now.
[04:55.000 --> 04:59.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, get ready. It's Monday, August 30th.

[05:05.000 --> 05:09.000]  That's why essential vitamins and minerals are called essential. You must have them.
[05:09.000 --> 05:15.000]  But in today's crazy times, it is more important than ever to stay on top of it.
[05:15.000 --> 05:18.000]  And the vitamin mineral fusion has been sold out for months and months and months.

[06:25.000 --> 06:30.000]  Wow. Another live broadcast.
[06:30.000 --> 06:34.000]  And I'm not up here crowing like a rooster on the roof.
[06:34.000 --> 06:40.000]  I'm just saying we know what we're talking about. And man, did it not come true just like we said it would.
[06:40.000 --> 06:45.000]  I thought knowing the globalist battle plans, we'd be able to turn this back.
[06:45.000 --> 06:51.000]  But you know, history shows and God's explained it to us over and over again that
[06:51.000 --> 06:56.000]  when we do evil long term and become corrupt,
[06:56.000 --> 07:00.000]  that God removes his protection and that we get judged really hard.
[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  And isn't that really justice?
[07:03.000 --> 07:07.000]  So as mad as we get at Bill Gates and as mad as we get at Hillary Clinton
[07:07.000 --> 07:10.000]  and these wicked implements of the New World Order,
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  at the end of the day, it's all part of God's larger plan to get us back on the straight and narrow.
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live, original Monday transmission.
[07:20.000 --> 07:27.000]  It is the best of times. It is the worst of times. It is such an incredible time to be alive here.
[07:27.000 --> 07:35.000]  And I am just blessed and thankful to be on the air and I'm blessed and thankful to have this amazing crew
[07:35.000 --> 07:44.000]  and to be able to speak uncensored and unfiltered and unfettered to all of you out there.
[07:44.000 --> 07:50.000]  And I just want to say up front, I'm thankful for my family and I'm thankful for all the blessings in my life
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.000]  and I'm thankful for the gift of consciousness.
[07:53.000 --> 07:59.000]  And God's really placed it on my heart to be more joyous and more positive in these dark times
[07:59.000 --> 08:06.000]  and to celebrate what's good and understand this is going to bring us together like nothing ever could have.
[08:06.000 --> 08:09.000]  No matter what damn color you are, where you came from,
[08:09.000 --> 08:15.000]  if you got red blood and you love liberty and you love justice, we are brothers and sisters in this fight against Satan.
[08:15.000 --> 08:19.000]  And believe me, Satan is extremely real and we're all starting to get a front row seat to that
[08:19.000 --> 08:22.000]  and it's going to get only more intense from here on out.
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.000]  We're going to look back on these days as the good old days with what's coming in the future
[08:27.000 --> 08:34.000]  because it always gets darkest before the dawn and the dawn when it comes is going to be spectacular
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  and the eye has not seen, the ear has not heard, the mind has not imagined what we're going to be witnessing
[08:39.000 --> 08:43.000]  because there will be new things under the sun at that point.
[08:43.000 --> 08:49.000]  There's been nothing new under the sun, ancient old Egyptians saying, ancient Greek saying, ancient Romans saying,
[08:49.000 --> 08:53.000]  they all said it, nobody knows who said it first, probably the Egyptians.
[08:53.000 --> 08:59.000]  But there will be new things under the sun, ladies and gentlemen, but not until Christ returns.
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.000]  Okay, let me give you the big enchilada.
[09:03.000 --> 09:07.000]  I'm going to open the phones up throughout the next four hours here today
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.000]  and I'm going to take calls on two subjects.
[09:11.000 --> 09:14.000]  What are you witnessing in the hospitals you work in?
[09:14.000 --> 09:18.000]  All these new mystery illnesses, all these weird polio diseases, hitting children,
[09:18.000 --> 09:22.000]  all these new respiratory problems we know are coming from the sloughing of the vaccine.
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  What are you witnessing in the hospitals?
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.000]  What have you witnessed if you did take the inoculations?
[09:28.000 --> 09:34.000]  If you did take the franken shots or your friends or your family have, we're going to debate
[09:34.000 --> 09:40.000]  the whole global awakening, we're going to debate what steps to take against the globalists, their forced inoculations
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  and it gives you a chance to call in and speak to millions.
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.000]  There are several million people listening each hour to hear your story,
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  something the globalists don't want heard.
[09:50.000 --> 09:55.000]  You have a funeral for your daughter that dies of the shot or a funeral for your dad or a funeral for your brother.
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  You try to talk about it on Facebook and he would show that the doctor said the vaccine killed him.
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  Facebook is invested in the vaccines with Mark Zuckerberg.
[10:02.000 --> 10:10.000]  They'll suppress you, just like Twitter, just like all the other major sites.
[10:10.000 --> 10:16.000]  So it's important to realize that they are colluding and that big pharma has merged with big tech
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  and this is true criminal activity.
[10:18.000 --> 10:26.000]  So I want to open the phones up so you have a chance to call in on that subject.
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  And there's a huge area there.
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000]  You can see the live show feed today of the broadcast, Global Nightmare.
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  UN announces plan to forcibly inject the world population every six months forever.
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.000]  And I have the WHO saying it, I have the Australian health minister saying it,
[10:44.000 --> 10:49.000]  I have the Spanish health minister saying it, I have the Israeli prime minister saying it,
[10:49.000 --> 10:54.000]  I have the British health minister saying it, I have the Canadian health minister saying it.
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  We knew a year and a half ago that was the plan.
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  I'm like, it's right here in the battle plans.
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  People are all over Twitter and Instagram going,
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  Jones, look, here's a video of him in March of last year saying they'll claim there's variants
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.000]  and you've got to have booster shots every six months.
[11:08.000 --> 11:14.000]  Guys, he's one of them. How the hell does he? Bill Gates went on TV and said it.
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.000]  It's in the documents. You can know everything I know.
[11:18.000 --> 11:23.000]  That's how we're going to win this is people are going to understand the globalist act like we're animals.
[11:23.000 --> 11:32.000]  And they write all these textbooks and white papers and battle plans and lockstep and crimson contagion and spars 2023.
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  And it's all right there.
[11:36.000 --> 11:42.000]  And then Bill Gates even says there's too many people and Peter Dazik says there's too many people and Fauci says it.
[11:42.000 --> 11:52.000]  And they ran the will on lab and did interviews in 2019 saying we're merging five viruses with the SARS virus to create a vaccine.
[11:52.000 --> 12:01.000]  And we have the email of Fauci in December 2019 months before the stuff got in the news saying, all right, roll out the vaccine for COVID-19.
[12:01.000 --> 12:10.000]  We have them. And whether it's Rand Paul or whether it's other people, even Tucker Carlson, who I love.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  They eat around the edges of this.
[12:13.000 --> 12:21.000]  Yeah, we've got videos of millions of views on Bandot video, smoking gun, head of Wuhan project, head of Fauci's project,
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.000]  admits to creating COVID-19. I mean, that's the name of the video. I'm going from memory, pull it up.
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.000]  It's an hour long video with clips of him saying it. But everybody has to like slowly.
[12:33.000 --> 12:42.000]  Oh, Intel agency say probable it came from a lab. Oh, Intel. The damn thing is a Chimera.
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.000]  They spliced five viruses. It was not very communicable.
[12:46.000 --> 12:53.000]  It was very hard to kill you because it was the first gen normal viruses become less lethal as they mutate.
[12:53.000 --> 13:03.000]  Not this. They already tested it in the lab and pigs. It becomes more communicable and more lethal as it mutates in the bodies of the injected
[13:03.000 --> 13:09.000]  who take a live virus vaccine. That's what the mRNA is. It's a live virus, the synthetic.
[13:09.000 --> 13:16.000]  That's what the Johnson and Johnson, the AstraZeneca and modern. It's all live virus.
[13:16.000 --> 13:24.000]  Live viruses shed. Do you want me to show you the Pfizer study they put out on this vaccine?
[13:24.000 --> 13:33.000]  I'm sitting there talking to my mom is a smart person last night and she goes, Alex, really, they really admit that this is all happening because it's shedding.
[13:33.000 --> 13:44.000]  And I got on her computer and I pulled it up and I'm going to show you today the damn studies Germany passed a law last year that they could shed on you with vaccines.
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.000]  The majority of polio is caused by shedding from the vaccine.
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.000]  And now it's shedding viruses that eat people's nerves.
[13:55.000 --> 14:02.000]  I know multiple people that got this and didn't test positive for COVID because it's not COVID. It's a new virus.
[14:02.000 --> 14:09.000]  And both of them have basically Alzheimer's now and don't know who they are a month later.
[14:09.000 --> 14:17.000]  Okay. And now the media is spinning it. Oh, look, they said it wasn't real. And now the hospitals are full. Yeah, like we predicted, like the top scientists did.
[14:17.000 --> 14:22.000]  You took the shots. It created super mutants. And now you're killing us.
[14:22.000 --> 14:31.000]  And Mitt Romney is running around saying, you're making me sick. You need to take. No, you're making us sick. You dirty corporate monster.
[14:31.000 --> 14:40.000]  And you are going to go to hell. You're a Satanist that want to implant me with the genetics of dead babies.
[14:40.000 --> 14:50.000]  And so are all these other devils. The Israeli Prime Minister is a devil. The Australian Prime Minister is a devil. They're all devils.
[14:50.000 --> 14:55.000]  They're raping you with a bio weapon.
[14:55.000 --> 15:07.000]  So we're going to lay it all out coming up. But here's the announcements. This is the New York Post. We have the video of this. Biden Fauci discussed requiring COVID boosters shots every five months.
[15:07.000 --> 15:15.000]  Oh, sorry. They said every six. So that's what I said a year and a half ago. It's every five.
[15:15.000 --> 15:32.000]  Kerry chant the medical spokesperson for New South Wales, one that says, don't talk to your neighbors, you know, don't look at the sunset. This kook has now rolled out and said, and so has one of the premiers of New South Wales as well came out and said,
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.000]  get used to it. You're going to get shots every six months. I got that clip coming up.
[15:37.000 --> 15:46.000]  So we're going to talk about that situation. And we're going to open the phones up on Biden and Afghanistan. And I think they're going to probably assassinate him and blame the Patriots.
[15:46.000 --> 15:55.000]  What do you think about that? We'll give the number out next segment. We're going to take your calls all day long on this special live Monday uncensored transmission.
[15:55.000 --> 16:03.000]  Everybody, you know, tune in now. Share the word, Paul Revere's if you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off grid electricity.
[16:03.000 --> 16:11.000]  This will be the most important message you'll hear this year. Here's why we now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[16:11.000 --> 16:25.000]  These emergency backup systems provide a life saving backup power when you need it most. And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes and produce an endless supply of free electricity for the sun.
[16:25.000 --> 16:34.000]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:34.000 --> 16:44.000]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off the grid bonuses too. Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[16:44.000 --> 16:54.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com. Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[17:24.000 --> 17:32.000]  That's about 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[17:32.000 --> 17:44.000]  It gets even better. With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well being, I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world, period.
[17:44.000 --> 17:57.000]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com that's soupbeansurvival.com and discover the real reason we're giving this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com that's soupbeansurvival.com.
[18:15.000 --> 18:22.000]  And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter you came out with that stew, you know, with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that so I took it.
[18:22.000 --> 18:32.000]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[18:32.000 --> 18:38.000]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[18:38.000 --> 18:45.000]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works.
[18:45.000 --> 18:50.000]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system.
[18:50.000 --> 18:54.000]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[18:54.000 --> 18:59.000]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[18:59.000 --> 19:03.000]  People can't really spend money anywhere better than mypilla.com with promo code Alex.
[19:03.000 --> 19:09.000]  Right now, what I've done is passed all the savings to the customer like sheets are geese sheets.
[19:09.000 --> 19:15.000]  They're normally you get 50% off with code Alex. They're as low as $49.99 depending on the size.
[19:15.000 --> 19:21.000]  We've got pillows. My pillows. My original mypilla premiums are normally $69.99, $29.99.
[19:21.000 --> 19:26.000]  The best thing I think all you guys, everyone out there, you can get my book for $9.99.
[19:26.000 --> 19:31.000]  My book will help anybody out there in addiction and that's free shipping with the book.
[19:31.000 --> 19:36.000]  Right now, all of the specials I used to run one here and one there, I put them all on there.
[19:36.000 --> 19:41.000]  The lowest prices you've ever seen and we have our new bed. Everybody, I don't know if you've seen our bed.
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.000]  I developed this bed over a year and a half. Best mattress you'll ever sleep on.
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.000]  It's a combination of coils and patented foam and this soft. They're amazing.
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  There's nothing better when I make them.
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  It's amazing that the cost is not high and you support freedom.
[19:54.000 --> 20:02.000]  Mypilla.com, promo code Alex. You've got so many great products and we're just really proud of the work you're doing, Mike.
[20:02.000 --> 20:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:11.000 --> 20:30.000]  We'll walk into this room in the year 2021. There's a world government run by ruthless corporations whose public policy is to build a post-human world based on forced depopulation.
[20:30.000 --> 20:37.000]  Everything they've told you is a lie. Everything they've done has been criminal. They've given themselves liability.
[20:37.000 --> 20:43.000]  They've got paramilitary police surveilling and physically attacking men, women and children all over the world.
[20:43.000 --> 20:53.000]  Now telling them they've got to take secretive shots every six months for the right to even leave their house and have the privilege of one hour outside a day.
[20:53.000 --> 21:03.000]  No, this isn't a Rod Serling episode of the Twilight Zone. This is Planet Earth at the end of August 2021.
[21:03.000 --> 21:08.000]  Okay, so let me give the number out.
[21:08.000 --> 21:16.000]  We do have a very special guest popping in who is a major Chinese whistleblower, the first exposed, Dr. Peter Dazek in the lab and all the rest of it.
[21:16.000 --> 21:22.000]  So we'll tell you about that coming up and she's going to be joining us in the third hour today.
[21:22.000 --> 21:25.000]  But she'll be with us 30 minutes. We'll continue on with calls after that.
[21:25.000 --> 21:33.000]  I want to give the number out and I want to give you a chance on geopolitical issues.
[21:33.000 --> 21:41.000]  The fact that I believe the next card they'll play is an attempted assassination or assassination of Biden to be blamed on someone that thinks he stole the election.
[21:41.000 --> 21:49.000]  They'll also call the white supremacist. They can roll out martial law and general honor race plan and the military is being trained for martial law and gun confiscation.
[21:49.000 --> 21:56.000]  That's why you've seen these viral videos of SJW is saying we're preparing for martial law. You catch you outside your house. We're going to kill you.
[21:56.000 --> 22:01.000]  They actually did that in New Orleans and other areas of Louisiana, Mississippi under Honor Ray.
[22:01.000 --> 22:08.000]  And Honor Ray is forming the cadres to try to lead the Civil War. It will go terribly for them.
[22:08.000 --> 22:16.000]  If you think the North Vietnamese were tough or the Taliban were tough, you see this military woman saying I'm going to take on the rednecks.
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.000]  I'm going to shoot you on your front step. I mean, you talk about a death wish.
[22:21.000 --> 22:28.000]  But remember, Biden just a few months ago mocked gun rights advocates who say they need assault weapons to fight the government.
[22:28.000 --> 22:32.000]  You need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons.
[22:32.000 --> 22:41.000]  So he's turned into Eric Swallowswell, who thinks if he bombs all the blue cities that he's already destroyed, that'll make us turn our guns in.
[22:41.000 --> 22:47.000]  No, that's not how that would work. Then we would just be invaded by outside enemies, which is your plan.
[22:47.000 --> 22:54.000]  But it shows there were a ruling outside group that has nothing but the stain for us and it sold the country out.
[22:54.000 --> 23:04.000]  So the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[23:04.000 --> 23:11.000]  First round of calls, first-time callers, please. Tell us your vaccine story. Did you love it? Did you hate it?
[23:11.000 --> 23:16.000]  Tell us your medical story about the hospitals. There's all these new mystery illnesses popping up.
[23:16.000 --> 23:20.000]  They admit that they're calling COVID, but then it's not.
[23:20.000 --> 23:25.000]  When the nurses complain, they get fired. They always had this planned. They said this would happen.
[23:25.000 --> 23:31.000]  The top experts warned it would give rise to superviruses once you gave people live virus injections
[23:31.000 --> 23:35.000]  that turned the body into spike protein producers.
[23:35.000 --> 23:41.000]  Hundreds of thousands of children now coming down with these polio-like diseases, which the government just says,
[23:41.000 --> 23:45.000]  look out for it. Won't say where it's coming from, but they're downplaying it.
[23:45.000 --> 23:48.000]  So anything real, they downplay anything fake, they play up.
[23:48.000 --> 23:54.000]  So a year ago, it was a hoax, a fraud, overblown, a real virus that they owned and controlled
[23:54.000 --> 24:01.000]  where they knew in studies they'd already done that the vaccine for that virus would then create
[24:01.000 --> 24:05.000]  the autoimmune diseases and all the rest of it, and the blood clots we're now seeing.
[24:05.000 --> 24:09.000]  We didn't just say that now. We said that 17, 18, 19 months ago.
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.000]  We said the vaccine wouldn't work. We said it would make you sick.
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  They would then call for more vaccines.
[24:14.000 --> 24:18.000]  Then you would get something like Merix disease in humans that they already have in chickens
[24:18.000 --> 24:24.000]  where they vaccinate for the common cold and then create super viruses that kill 100% of the chickens
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  until they give them a final shot that turns them into a giant living tumor.
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  I'm not joking. This is not a science fiction movie.
[24:31.000 --> 24:37.000]  A giant tumor lives in excruciating pain.
[24:37.000 --> 24:41.000]  All the nerves triple in size. The joints double in size. They go blind,
[24:41.000 --> 24:47.000]  but they do swell up into giant blobs of meat, which they then ship to your dinner table.
[24:47.000 --> 24:51.000]  That's why so much of the chicken you taste is all bubbling and has like tumors and things in it
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  as you're eating Merix disease.
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.000]  So this is all part of their globalist attack.
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  Just like Klaus Schwab says you'll own nothing. You'll have nothing.
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  Bill Gates says you'll drink sewage. You'll eat bugs.
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.000]  Now it's all over the news. Drink sewage, eat bugs.
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  You're like, that sounds super dystopic. Yeah.
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  Their followers are in a trance and will do anything they're told.
[25:11.000 --> 25:15.000]  Like, don't look at the sunset. Don't talk to your neighbors.
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  They're unvaccinated or making you sick.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  You know, the statistics show the opposite.
[25:19.000 --> 25:27.000]  They've got their cult members ready to jump off a clip if they're told.
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  They can say, come to me, my child. Come to me.
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.000]  And a lot of us would say, you can fly. You're a bird.
[25:32.000 --> 25:37.000]  As long as Obama said it, ah, the little girl would jump off like in false of doom
[25:37.000 --> 25:41.000]  and come in the barbarian and fall 500 feet, smashing to the floor.
[25:41.000 --> 25:47.000]  Believe me, if Biden came out and told his followers to go to 50-story buildings
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.000]  and jump off, millions would run and begin jumping off right now.
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  Do not look at the sunset. Do not talk to your neighbors.
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  Teach children, pedophilia is good. Teach children, rule government's good.
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  And we'll also have the phones up about Biden and clearly they want to try
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.000]  to assassinate him or stage that event. I think that's the ace of spades card
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  they've got with the fact that he's being so politically destroyed
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.000]  and so prepared right now. What is your take on that?
[26:11.000 --> 26:16.000]  I'd love to hear from you. 877-789-2539.
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.000]  All right, let me do this. I'm going to come back and I'm going to hit the huge news
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  with the UN and everybody announcing permanent shots every five to six months.
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  That's just the way it is in Fauci announces.
[26:26.000 --> 26:29.000]  Soon as the UN said it, he clicked his heels and said, yes, now is the time.
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  You will always have to take the shots. You'll have to, and of course,
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  lower your immunity. Three shots lower you to one-sixth of your previous
[26:38.000 --> 26:43.000]  immunity and turn off your white blood cells, your killer T's.
[26:43.000 --> 26:48.000]  That's in mainline studies. I mean, HIV kills the T lymphocytes that train
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  the cells, the white blood cells. This just turns off your killer T's,
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.000]  the one that actually go around eating viruses and bacteria.
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  Looks just like the movie The Blob. It's like 100 times bigger than normal bacteria
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.000]  and thousands of times bigger than viruses. Then it just comes up and goes,
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.000]  the blob, the blob, here comes the blob and eats it.
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  And then craps it out and that's the pus that you get in a cut or a wound or
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.000]  that you cough up. It's all the poop from the killer T's, gobbling, gobbling.
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  They're like amoebas. They're close to the size of an amoeba.
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  They're your body's amoebas and they're literally like King Kong or Godzilla.
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.000]  Well, this new thing doesn't, the Pfizer shots and Moderna shots, don't kill them.
[27:29.000 --> 27:34.000]  They just make them stop moving.
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.000]  They just, they just go to sleep and stop operating.
[27:38.000 --> 27:41.000]  Isn't that little liberal?
[27:41.000 --> 27:46.000]  Now listen, I need your support listeners. We got in the black
[27:46.000 --> 27:51.000]  from being in the red earlier this year, but now the funds are just stable
[27:51.000 --> 27:56.000]  and I've got four new products that are over a year in development that are awesome
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  that you're going to love and are going to fund us, but I was in an hour of accounting meetings this morning.
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  I do not have the money and I'm not complaining. I need your help.
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.000]  I need your help to bring this to market and fund ourselves and this will really help us expand, I believe.
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  I believe these are going to be hit products because they're basically souped up clones
[28:12.000 --> 28:17.000]  of stuff that's already out there that are best sellers at lower prices.
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.000]  So I need to bring in a lot of money right now to be able to buy these four new products
[28:22.000 --> 28:26.000]  that have been waiting for six months to be made because I haven't had the money.
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.000]  We did the accounting. I do not have the money to produce the four new products.
[28:30.000 --> 28:34.000]  I need to get it done before the next lockdown happens and I need money.
[28:34.000 --> 28:39.000]  I gave the crew a bonus. They deserve it. They're great, but now we don't have the money for the extra product.
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  I believe the crew deserve it. They're doing a great job working 14 hours a day.
[28:42.000 --> 28:47.000]  So I need your support, listeners. Go get vitamin mineral fusion back in stock 30% off.
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.000]  Get a t-shirt, get a book, get a film, get the charcoal, activated charcoal toothpaste,

[28:58.000 --> 29:03.000]  Hey, everybody. Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture? Me too.
[29:03.000 --> 29:10.000]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[29:10.000 --> 29:14.000]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.000]  You probably already believe that. I certainly do.
[29:17.000 --> 29:27.000]  So here's the thing. I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.

[32:56.000 --> 33:24.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:24.000 --> 33:38.000]  Listeners are now finally getting it.
[33:38.000 --> 33:40.000]  Leaders around the world are getting it.
[33:40.000 --> 33:42.000]  Prominent talk show hosts are now getting it.
[33:42.000 --> 33:44.000]  I'm not making any of this up.
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.000]  I'm sorry it's so shocking.
[33:46.000 --> 33:47.000]  I'm sorry it's so scary.
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  I'm sorry these people are such criminals.
[33:49.000 --> 33:55.000]  And as soon as we wake up to the fact that this is a planetary world government takeover,
[33:55.000 --> 34:02.000]  this ideology is a scientific dictatorship that wants to carry out forced depopulation.
[34:02.000 --> 34:09.000]  The minute everybody gets, it doesn't matter if you're old, young, gay, straight, black, white, Hispanic, Chinese, it doesn't matter.
[34:09.000 --> 34:12.000]  The globalists are coming after you and want to depopulate you.
[34:12.000 --> 34:13.000]  They've made the decision.
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  They're totally ruthless.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  They believe they're about to merge with machines and become gods.
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  They are megalomaniacs.
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  You either get that or you don't.
[34:21.000 --> 34:24.000]  This is transhumanism, the post-human world.
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.000]  It's their revolution against you.
[34:26.000 --> 34:30.000]  And you can sell out to them and maybe live a few years longer than everybody else.
[34:30.000 --> 34:33.000]  But they're going to get everybody in the end.
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  This is a very alien operation.
[34:36.000 --> 34:43.000]  And I don't speculate on flying saucers and Sidonium Mars bases and all that stuff.
[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  This is interdimensional.
[34:45.000 --> 34:47.000]  This is the Bible.
[34:47.000 --> 34:48.000]  This is Satan.
[34:48.000 --> 34:58.000]  This is a fallen interdimensional entity that wants to rob us of our godlike intellect, little g, and basically build his escape system.
[34:58.000 --> 35:03.000]  Satan's older than us, but we are way more advanced and are able to actually build all this.
[35:03.000 --> 35:05.000]  Satan is not giving us all this technology.
[35:05.000 --> 35:08.000]  Satan is twisting it and using it for control.
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  So this isn't a science fiction movie, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  This is the real world.
[35:13.000 --> 35:28.000]  I've analyzed this in depth and I've studied the globalists and the reason they're into the occult and the reason they do horrible things is to resonate with their god and to get under its control to be able to mesh with it and interface with it.
[35:28.000 --> 35:37.000]  And that's why they do so many horrible things and child sacrifice and wars is to prove themselves and to align themselves with this entity.
[35:37.000 --> 35:42.000]  And their mission is to get rid of their human bodies and merge with machines and they believe become gods.
[35:42.000 --> 35:53.000]  And that's now Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post, NBC News, looking forward to the end of humanity and how we're a bad species and how we've got to be gotten rid of.
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.000]  Now they want to force us into these virtual reality hells that Facebook is pushing.
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.000]  This is all incredibly destructive.
[36:01.000 --> 36:09.000]  That's why Apple came out and said we're going to read everything you do on your phone and scan all your photos to make sure you're not a criminal.
[36:09.000 --> 36:13.000]  And again, the allegory is excellent of Bill Maher.
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  It's like having a safe company.
[36:15.000 --> 36:25.000]  You go buy a safe at the local safe shop or at Walmart or wherever and they say, oh, we're going to drop by once a month and look at what's in your safe just to make sure there's no child porn.
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  It's guilty until proven innocent.
[36:27.000 --> 36:36.000]  Or it's like saying you got to live in a glass house and never turn your lights off like your own suicide watch because you might commit suicide or you might rape your kids.
[36:36.000 --> 36:42.000]  This system doesn't give you more empowerment. It gives you less empowerment.
[36:42.000 --> 36:52.000]  And so we knew from the Pfizer prospectus, as they put out 18, 19 months ago, they said, we're going to make trillions.
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  We'll be the dominant company.
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  We will have vaccine passports.
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.000]  The public will accept Operation Lockstep.
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  Everyone will have to have shots every six to eight months.
[37:04.000 --> 37:12.000]  And then you can see their executives on television saying, oh, it's incredible.
[37:12.000 --> 37:16.000]  The first shot lowers your immunity by 30%.
[37:16.000 --> 37:19.000]  The second shot lowers it by about 70%.
[37:19.000 --> 37:27.000]  And the third shot, you have one six your previous immunity and they start smiling and saying, so you're going to need boosters for life.
[37:27.000 --> 37:32.000]  Remember, I played those clips just three months ago and people said, oh, they must be misspeaking.
[37:32.000 --> 37:37.000]  I'm not going to do that. I'm like, it's the battle plan. It's the battle plan.
[37:37.000 --> 37:41.000]  And see if we admit to the battle plan ahead of time, we can stop it.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  But no, that's not how we do it.
[37:43.000 --> 37:48.000]  We always wait until it's on top of us.
[37:48.000 --> 37:56.000]  We always wait until they're knocking down our doors till they're dragging us away, till they're shutting us down, till they're telling us we're not essential,
[37:56.000 --> 38:01.000]  or till we're dying from the new mutated viruses.
[38:01.000 --> 38:08.000]  And from Germany to Australia, now to Canada and the U.S., they are beating people who are outside during the lockdowns.
[38:08.000 --> 38:19.000]  They are stomping on their heads because they're being rewarded and told to do so.
[38:19.000 --> 38:22.000]  And so let me go over this for you.
[38:22.000 --> 38:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Biden, Fauci discussed requiring COVID booster shots every five months.
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  Imagine the dictatorial level of that power.
[38:33.000 --> 38:39.000]  By the way, Vladimir Putin came out and said, no one should be forced to take inoculations.
[38:39.000 --> 38:46.000]  And here's Kerry Chant, the same one that says, don't talk to your neighbors and don't go in your backyard.
[38:46.000 --> 38:53.000]  She says, are you paying attention, Dr. Chant, we need to get used to being vaccinated with COVID vaccines for the future.
[38:53.000 --> 38:56.000]  You see?
[38:56.000 --> 39:06.000]  And now the head of Queensland, their premier came out, I have a video clip and said, oh, it doesn't matter if a whole sport stadium is inoculated,
[39:06.000 --> 39:12.000]  you still have to keep taking more shots, you still got to wear a mask, and you still probably can't go outside.
[39:12.000 --> 39:15.000]  We're never going to let anybody ever die of a cold again.
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  We're going to give you shots, though, that suddenly make everybody sick.
[39:18.000 --> 39:23.000]  And that's why now Australia's got all these weird illnesses and polio-style illnesses and weird viruses,
[39:23.000 --> 39:29.000]  and they're saying, well, it's not COVID, it's not testing as COVID, because it's a whole new mutated virus.
[39:29.000 --> 39:33.000]  They knew in the laboratory it would do this, thousands of new mutations.
[39:33.000 --> 39:41.000]  And these creepy, weird authoritarians, almost all of them Communist Party members, are coming out and doing this.
[39:41.000 --> 39:48.000]  We just sit here with these maniac criminals doing this under Mass.com syndrome and can't call for their arrest.
[39:48.000 --> 39:51.000]  Or we let the Prime Minister of Australia play good cop.
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  Oh, I'm sorry the local regions are doing this. I can't help you.
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  Here she is.
[39:57.000 --> 40:19.000]  We need to get used to being vaccinated with COVID vaccines for the future.
[40:19.000 --> 40:25.000]  I can't see that COVID is not going to be with us forever.
[40:25.000 --> 40:30.000]  Maybe in the future we can have even better vaccines and coverage across the world to achieve that.
[40:30.000 --> 40:37.000]  I mean, as a public health doctor, we always want to have diseases go, get totally eliminated,
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  but that's not on the horizon in the near future.
[40:39.000 --> 40:43.000]  So booster doses, repeat doses will be part of it.
[40:43.000 --> 40:48.000]  You know, there'll be different advice about different schedules, which doses you get.
[40:48.000 --> 40:54.000]  But at the moment, our priority has to be getting first and second doses into people,
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  and there will be recommendations about booster doses in the future.
[40:58.000 --> 41:06.000]  And I can assure you that the Commonwealth government has purchased a large quantities of vaccine into 2022,
[41:06.000 --> 41:15.000]  and this will be a regular cycle of vaccination and re-vaccination as we learn more about when immunity waits.
[41:15.000 --> 41:21.000]  As we learn more, so you can go back to Bill Gates in March of last year saying,
[41:21.000 --> 41:27.000]  I take boosters every six months, and you can go back to us saying it and their own documents and then bragging about it.
[41:27.000 --> 41:32.000]  Because it doesn't work. It's not a vaccine. It's a gene therapy that destroys your immune system.
[41:32.000 --> 41:37.000]  And then some Frankenstein looking kook lady is put in there because she'll do this.
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  And they're like, hey, when do we get our freedoms back to go back to normal if we've taken the shots?
[41:41.000 --> 41:45.000]  And she just looks at him and says, he doesn't go back to normal.
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  You've got to get used to a cycle.
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.000]  We'll tell you what's going in your body when.
[41:51.000 --> 41:56.000]  And then you die or you get sick, and she just sits there and laughs because they're cult leaders.
[41:56.000 --> 41:59.000]  Oh, but the head of Pfizer, he says he doesn't need the shot.
[41:59.000 --> 42:04.000]  He goes, I'm 51 years old and I don't have any health problems, so I don't need it.
[42:04.000 --> 42:09.000]  See, the ruling class fly around on private jets live on giant palatial islands.
[42:09.000 --> 42:15.000]  You will take all the shots they say to have a job or leave your house.
[42:15.000 --> 42:18.000]  They're putting it all in place right now.
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  The chains are going on now.
[42:20.000 --> 42:26.000]  All the big apps for open table and for Airbnb and everything are saying,
[42:26.000 --> 42:30.000]  oh, you're going to have to put vaccine status in this app to use our functions.
[42:30.000 --> 42:33.000]  And the more you give in, the tighter the grip goes.
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.000]  And then when the vaccinated take the deadly shots and they're dying,
[42:36.000 --> 42:42.000]  they're going to blame us because they can't admit they got conned, just like the Nigerian email scam.
[42:42.000 --> 42:45.000]  You pay the $1,000 thinking you're going to get $10,000.
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.000]  Then they don't give you the money. Now they want $10,000. You give them the $10,000.
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  These people never admit they're scammed.
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  They'll end up selling their house for the Nigerians.
[42:52.000 --> 42:58.000]  And if you tell them they got scammed, they'll physically attack you. It's the same deal.
[42:58.000 --> 43:05.000]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[43:05.000 --> 43:09.000]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses,
[43:09.000 --> 43:12.000]  which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[43:12.000 --> 43:17.000]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland
[43:17.000 --> 43:22.000]  and shuts down its natural functions, natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.000]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[43:25.000 --> 43:31.000]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye, also described as the seat of the soul.
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness
[43:35.000 --> 43:38.000]  and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[43:38.000 --> 43:43.000]  Fluoride-free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[43:43.000 --> 43:49.000]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride-free
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.000]  and the pro-pure shower head will seal the deal.
[43:52.000 --> 43:58.000]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend at InfowarsStore.com.
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  What are champions made of?

[45:56.400 --> 46:25.920]  fullwarstore.com.
[46:25.920 --> 46:31.200]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell us just five years ago, if somebody told you this
[46:31.200 --> 46:36.440]  would be happening, but it is happening now and then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's not
[46:36.440 --> 46:39.080]  a vaccine, it's a gene therapy and it doesn't really work.
[46:39.080 --> 46:43.800]  So you got to take it every few months and the people that have submitted say, great,
[46:43.800 --> 46:47.720]  I want to take it all the time so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID, even
[46:47.720 --> 46:49.360]  though it gets you sick from COVID.
[46:49.360 --> 46:53.200]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding
[46:53.200 --> 46:56.120]  of the virus and that's in mainline studies.
[46:56.120 --> 47:02.600]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now.
[47:02.600 --> 47:12.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:12.040 --> 47:25.880]  So Bill Gates came out and told you over a year and a half ago that all the documents,
[47:25.880 --> 47:31.360]  it's a plan to take over all human biological activity and destroy your immune system where
[47:31.360 --> 47:36.600]  you have to get vaccines every week or so is their in-game plan of gene therapies to
[47:36.600 --> 47:41.480]  even live because everything on the outside environment will then kill you.
[47:41.480 --> 47:46.440]  So first it's two shots, then it's every six months, then it's every five months, then
[47:46.440 --> 47:51.000]  it's every four months, they're now having the think tank say you need 10 shots a year
[47:51.000 --> 47:54.120]  just for COVID.
[47:54.120 --> 47:57.760]  And now you see the trap and I really feel sorry for folks that just wanted to get out
[47:57.760 --> 48:00.600]  there, get ahead of this, they thought they were protecting people, they believed the
[48:00.600 --> 48:02.920]  social contract was still in place.
[48:02.920 --> 48:05.920]  So we have the UN announcing it, we have all these health ministers around the world announcing
[48:05.920 --> 48:08.000]  it, we have Fauci announcing it.
[48:08.000 --> 48:13.720]  There's Tedros who has admitted Marxist Leninist who works directly for Xi Jinping who helps
[48:13.720 --> 48:18.240]  spread cholera around his own Ethiopia and kill over a million people and cover it up.
[48:18.240 --> 48:22.040]  That's why he was given the job as the head of the WHO.
[48:22.040 --> 48:26.440]  Here he is talking about Marburg virus, a new scary thing that don't worry, we've got a
[48:26.440 --> 48:32.200]  new mandatory shot for you as well and then just like all the UN vaccine programs, it's
[48:32.200 --> 48:37.360]  a live virus just like the polio, just like the mRNA, just like the virus vector, just
[48:37.360 --> 48:42.600]  like the Moderna, just like the Pfizer, just like the J&J and now it's going to give rise
[48:42.600 --> 48:49.680]  even more viruses and then more illness and more sickness and this is their plan.
[48:49.680 --> 48:54.040]  Humanity rose up against him, humanity said no and the ruling elite said let's just depopulate
[48:54.040 --> 49:00.040]  their ass, let's go ahead and pull the trigger, the time has come, the time is now.
[49:00.040 --> 49:07.640]  People public, you must die now, so here he is who have been identified as high-risk close
[49:07.640 --> 49:08.640]  contacts.
[49:08.640 --> 49:16.800]  Marburg is a very different virus to the one that goes COVID-19, but many of the elements
[49:16.800 --> 49:24.040]  of the response are the same, isolating and caring for those infected, tracing and quarantining
[49:24.040 --> 49:30.240]  their contacts and engaging local communities in the response.
[49:30.240 --> 49:37.400]  There is no licensed vaccine for Marburg, although there are vaccines under development
[49:37.400 --> 49:44.360]  and WHO is working with our partners to seek opportunities to assist them during this outbreak
[49:44.360 --> 49:49.040]  through the R&D blueprint for epidemics.
[49:49.040 --> 49:52.880]  And of course, if you go back to March of last year, they rolled out the first vaccine
[49:52.880 --> 49:58.640]  cards to show them to you, they had six in the U.K., five in the U.S., six in Canada and
[49:58.640 --> 50:06.000]  ten in France and Germany and they're now announcing ten shots a year in the White Papers.
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.800]  They're only announcing shots every five months now and of course it'll just destroy you,
[50:10.800 --> 50:14.040]  but that's okay because there's too many people, right?
[50:14.040 --> 50:18.520]  So I want to go to your phone calls, but I want to go over these headlines again, Biden
[50:18.520 --> 50:24.640]  and Fauci discuss requiring COVID booster shots every five months, oh, see how the trap works?
[50:24.640 --> 50:29.320]  The head of New South Wales says, oh, get used to it, you'll always have shots and we're
[50:29.320 --> 50:32.360]  never going back to normal and you're just going to have all these new shots all the
[50:32.360 --> 50:33.360]  time.
[50:33.360 --> 50:34.360]  That's just the way it is, get used to it.
[50:34.360 --> 50:38.240]  And she looks like a, some kind of like satanic demon while she says it because she's a stone
[50:38.240 --> 50:39.600]  cold killer.
[50:39.600 --> 50:41.600]  She knows what she's part of.
[50:41.600 --> 50:47.400]  Meanwhile, Putin opposes mandatory jabs, says people should get vaccinated without
[50:47.400 --> 50:50.240]  coercion if they want to.
[50:50.240 --> 50:54.760]  So there's your evil authoritarian, the videos on info wars.com.
[50:54.760 --> 50:59.840]  Joe Rogan says he won't force fans to get vaccinated to see stupid effing comedy show.
[50:59.840 --> 51:08.400]  I love it, Joe, more and more of a champion every day and here's the bad news, restaurant
[51:08.400 --> 51:13.160]  reservation app open table to integrate vaccine status into service.
[51:13.160 --> 51:14.440]  Don't use open table.
[51:14.440 --> 51:19.560]  Do not go to restaurants that segregate you or do that right here in Travis County where
[51:19.560 --> 51:22.440]  my children live.
[51:22.440 --> 51:26.520]  And my oldest daughter said, I want to go to public school a few years ago.
[51:26.520 --> 51:29.920]  She's 17 now about to graduate soon.
[51:29.920 --> 51:32.360]  And I said, okay, honey, you want to go, you can go.
[51:32.360 --> 51:36.440]  Well now she doesn't want to go because they put them in a detention hall if they don't
[51:36.440 --> 51:39.800]  wear a mask, even though the governor signed an executive order, even though Supreme Court
[51:39.800 --> 51:43.960]  said don't do it, they don't care because they're all about persecuting people and bringing
[51:43.960 --> 51:47.120]  in anti-American totalitarianism.
[51:47.120 --> 51:51.480]  So I told her, let's sue them and she goes, no, I just want to change schools.
[51:51.480 --> 51:55.440]  But that's where we are right now.
[51:55.440 --> 52:01.320]  Restaurant reservation app open table to integrate vaccination status into service.
[52:01.320 --> 52:02.320]  You got to stand against us now.
[52:02.320 --> 52:06.960]  Oh, look, Israel warns COVID green pass will expire if residents don't get the third jab
[52:06.960 --> 52:09.240]  and now they're announcing they'll be a fourth.
[52:09.240 --> 52:10.600]  It's not about the medicine.
[52:10.600 --> 52:11.600]  It's not about science.
[52:11.600 --> 52:15.080]  It's all pre-programmed because it is about the science.
[52:15.080 --> 52:17.880]  These shots get rid of your immune system.
[52:17.880 --> 52:18.880]  I can show you the studies.
[52:18.880 --> 52:26.320]  I can show you the head of the main British lab that works for Pfizer giggling about it.
[52:26.320 --> 52:27.960]  And it gets worse.
[52:27.960 --> 52:34.120]  Up to 62% of mRNA vaccinated show evidence of blood clotting in a new major study finding
[52:34.120 --> 52:38.720]  the exact number other scientists found in Canada.
[52:38.720 --> 52:44.880]  Every dot news, they do the D dimer test within days of them taking it, 60% say they have
[52:44.880 --> 52:48.200]  blood clots.
[52:48.200 --> 52:51.360]  New Zealand reports deaths for the first time.
[52:51.360 --> 52:55.760]  They've been covering them up from Pfizer COVID injection.
[52:55.760 --> 53:00.840]  Chaotic scenes in Athens has close to a million people protest COVID tyranny.
[53:00.840 --> 53:04.440]  And imagine if they start getting aggressive towards the bureaucrats.
[53:04.440 --> 53:06.960]  What's going to happen?
[53:06.960 --> 53:11.400]  And the police again are trying to disperse them because it's a globalist takeover, training
[53:11.400 --> 53:18.920]  us to stay at home, go bankrupt, go on welfare so they can dictate total control of our lives.
[53:18.920 --> 53:23.320]  Switzerland's vaccination centers could be targeted by terrorist nations, intel agencies
[53:23.320 --> 53:24.320]  say.
[53:24.320 --> 53:27.840]  That means globalist intel agencies are going to attack vaccine centers to try to say people
[53:27.840 --> 53:30.280]  that protesting against vaccines are terrorists.
[53:30.280 --> 53:32.680]  And then that'll just make everybody terrorist at that point.
[53:32.680 --> 53:38.120]  You make protesting illegal, well, you know what happens next, tens of thousands dying
[53:38.120 --> 53:40.200]  from COVID vaccines in Mexico as well.
[53:40.200 --> 53:41.640]  That's being covered up.
[53:41.640 --> 53:44.480]  Now, let me tell you about this.
[53:44.480 --> 53:49.480]  Chinese virologist says Fauci's emails verify her Wuhan lab leak claims.
[53:49.480 --> 53:55.440]  She's joining us in the third hour today, Li Mingyan.
[53:55.440 --> 53:59.000]  She's been dead on the whole time, but when she gets on the show, she only has five minutes.
[53:59.000 --> 54:03.600]  She tried to explain Peter Dazek and the admissions and, you know, she worked in these labs.
[54:03.600 --> 54:04.600]  She's an expert on it.
[54:04.600 --> 54:05.600]  She's joining us.
[54:05.600 --> 54:12.040]  That's going to be invaluable information coming up today.
[54:12.040 --> 54:15.560]  There's so much more I want to get to, but I want to go to break here in a few minutes
[54:15.560 --> 54:20.280]  and come back and go directly to your phone calls.
[54:20.280 --> 54:21.840]  And we've got so much other tyranny.
[54:21.840 --> 54:24.640]  I love how these judges aren't doctors, but act like they are.
[54:24.640 --> 54:30.640]  A judge asked a mother if she got the coronavirus vaccine, she said, no, and he revoked custody
[54:30.640 --> 54:31.640]  of her son.
[54:31.640 --> 54:35.120]  So they're now taking your children, something like the UN said.
[54:35.120 --> 54:36.920]  We will take your children.
[54:36.920 --> 54:40.160]  What about the Democrats said on the news?
[54:40.160 --> 54:42.640]  Kathleen Sebelius said, you shouldn't be able to have your kids.
[54:42.640 --> 54:46.360]  Obama's former head of health and services shouldn't be able to have your children have
[54:46.360 --> 54:48.080]  a job or go to the grocery store.
[54:48.080 --> 54:49.400]  And now what have they done in Europe?
[54:49.400 --> 54:50.400]  That exact thing.
[54:50.400 --> 54:52.040]  And now it's here.
[54:52.040 --> 54:57.280]  Take your child away because you won't take an experimental shot.
[54:57.280 --> 54:58.920]  See how we're all here?
[54:58.920 --> 55:04.360]  I was reading globalist documents 30 years ago where Bertrand Russell said, we will
[55:04.360 --> 55:08.040]  give everybody forced injections to lower their IQ and control them and to make them
[55:08.040 --> 55:09.640]  sick with binary weapons.
[55:09.640 --> 55:10.840]  He wrote that in the 40s.
[55:10.840 --> 55:14.120]  I was reading it 30 years ago.
[55:14.120 --> 55:17.640]  He wanted to have a nuclear war to take out the general population of the world of bioweapons
[55:17.640 --> 55:18.640]  wouldn't work.
[55:18.640 --> 55:28.400]  He wanted a Nobel Prize and here it is, ENES ISD to separate unmasked students, KVUE.
[55:28.400 --> 55:29.720]  Look at that discrimination.
[55:29.720 --> 55:32.640]  Look at what these criminals are testing and they're also segregating black from white
[55:32.640 --> 55:38.720]  students all over the country just to see what they can get away with.
[55:38.720 --> 55:39.960]  What will you put up with?
[55:39.960 --> 55:42.640]  That's what they're testing right now.
[55:42.640 --> 55:49.680]  Meanwhile, we've got more on the hurricane and the power outages of Mississippi, Louisiana.
[55:49.680 --> 55:50.680]  Pray for those folks.
[55:50.680 --> 55:52.280]  That's all coming up.
[55:52.280 --> 55:54.000]  Let me talk about this now.
[55:54.000 --> 55:57.600]  I'm just totally open about our operation with listeners.
[55:57.600 --> 56:01.120]  We're funded by you buying t-shirts, books, films, supplements, water filtration, air
[56:01.120 --> 56:03.120]  filtration, furble food, infowarstore.com.
[56:03.120 --> 56:07.560]  We want to be really high quality and well priced so you want to come back and shop
[56:07.560 --> 56:09.040]  again and keep us on air.
[56:09.040 --> 56:11.640]  It's a symbiotic relationship.
[56:11.640 --> 56:13.960]  We have barely been in the block the last three or four months.
[56:13.960 --> 56:17.680]  I did a bonus for the crew that took out most of the extra money we had.
[56:17.680 --> 56:18.680]  That's fine and dandy.
[56:18.680 --> 56:19.880]  I thought we had a little bit more money.
[56:19.880 --> 56:24.280]  I have four new products that I want to order that are going to be amazing, that are supplements,
[56:24.280 --> 56:30.120]  that are game changing and will help fund us and are going to do some really cool things.
[56:30.120 --> 56:34.120]  Some of this is third party stuff we've done deals with where we're going to advertise
[56:34.120 --> 56:38.840]  supplements and sell them on other sites, other places and I won't be connected to it
[56:38.840 --> 56:42.400]  and then that will allow us to advertise outside of info wars like I used to do but we're all
[56:42.400 --> 56:45.920]  black, bold and persecuted so then I'll be able to take outside money and fund us as
[56:45.920 --> 56:46.920]  well.
[56:46.920 --> 56:50.120]  I've got a lot of exciting things going to keep this operation going and your partners
[56:50.120 --> 56:52.440]  in this fight so I need your help.
[56:52.440 --> 56:56.720]  Buy an extra t-shirt, buy an extra book, buy an extra film this week or this month on top

[57:02.520 --> 57:05.480]  don't have the funds to purchase these four products that we've been developing over the
[57:05.480 --> 57:09.680]  last really couple of years but intensely the last year and I've been waiting for six

[58:58.080 --> 59:01.520]  you know I went a little bit crazy, I put turbo force in my coffee, that was a crazy
[59:01.520 --> 59:05.480]  week, I don't remember sleeping but as far as the products go, turbo force is my favorite

[59:08.880 --> 59:16.320]  of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you, nobody wakes up in the morning

[59:19.280 --> 59:22.800]  today, you know what, I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there
[59:22.800 --> 59:26.320]  healthier, happier and richer, I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend,
[59:26.320 --> 59:29.360]  I don't think that happens very often, it's never happened to me, I've never had anyone
[59:29.360 --> 59:32.720]  knock on my door and said, Tate you're such a good guy, how can I improve your life in
[59:32.720 --> 59:36.000]  every single way, there's only one person who woke up and thought that and that was
[59:36.000 --> 59:39.480]  me, I woke up and thought you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life, I want
[59:39.480 --> 59:42.240]  to take control of my health and that's why you need to go to infowars.com, take control
[59:42.240 --> 59:45.800]  of your health right now and support the resistance, don't buy into the group think, don't drink
[59:45.800 --> 59:52.080]  the Kool-Aid, drink the turbo force, Kool-Aid's bad and the turbo force is good.
[59:52.080 --> 59:59.080]  Thank you for listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:23.080 --> 1:00:30.080]  Some would make him king, others wouldn't stand for that, and he rose again, wise men follow
[1:00:30.080 --> 1:00:37.080]  him, wise men follow him, wise men follow him, thank you so much for joining us on this
[1:00:51.680 --> 1:00:58.480]  August 30th transmission as we go in through and beyond the storm, wow, it's all happening
[1:00:58.480 --> 1:01:04.240]  and it is scary as hell, ladies and gentlemen, I have experienced it, all the smart money
[1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:09.080]  and the people I trust that are as smart as I am are smarter have noticed that it's Florida
[1:01:09.080 --> 1:01:13.520]  and Texas and other conservative states that have off the chart illnesses and problems,
[1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:18.720]  but when they're tested, they don't have COVID, it is a pry on probably being sprayed in the
[1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:25.040]  air, just like they first hit an area of Italy, an area of China and an area of the US to
[1:01:25.040 --> 1:01:29.480]  create fear beforehand, this is a bio weapon attack, you have the same globalists that
[1:01:29.480 --> 1:01:34.280]  ran the Tuskegee experiment, some of the other criminal activities now in charge of this,
[1:01:34.280 --> 1:01:41.280]  so all I can tell you is get as healthy as you can and also get right with God because
[1:01:44.680 --> 1:01:48.720]  the new world order is making its move and has released a soft kill weapon to break down
[1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:55.720]  the US for its eventual control collapse and their main enemies are voting blocks where
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:01.200]  we still have some integrity in voting and can block their political will, so those are
[1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:06.120]  the areas that are now going to be targeted to bring us down like the blue cities and
[1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:09.720]  the answer to counter them is what's happened with Larry Elder, Larry Elder has been a guest
[1:02:09.720 --> 1:02:14.960]  for 20 years on my show, Larry Elder came up through the trenches, a great lawyer, a
[1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:20.600]  great patriot, he's not some fly by night conservative, I mean he'd make a great president,
[1:02:20.600 --> 1:02:24.920]  the policy probably will end up being president if he get elected in California, the problem
[1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:31.680]  is they are sending out all these ballots, they put a hole on purpose in the envelope
[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:37.240]  where you can see if you're voting for the recall, they're running all sorts of scams,
[1:02:37.240 --> 1:02:42.840]  they've caught a bunch of Democrats and criminals with their vehicles full of ballots obviously
[1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:48.640]  for the recall that they're throwing away and so there's no doubt Larry Elder will win,
[1:02:48.640 --> 1:02:55.640]  the question is will they steal it, we'll find out in the next 14 days, but I'm all
[1:02:57.640 --> 1:03:02.280]  for electing people that have black skin if they're qualified or white skin or whatever
[1:03:02.280 --> 1:03:07.360]  color skin they've got but with the left the folks they're getting whether they're women
[1:03:07.360 --> 1:03:11.680]  or black people or whoever are communists and that's why they're not qualified, Larry
[1:03:11.680 --> 1:03:17.040]  Elder would make a great governor and we need people like him to be president quite frankly
[1:03:17.040 --> 1:03:22.880]  to shut down the racepaders but that's why they're coming after him so damn bad so pray
[1:03:22.880 --> 1:03:27.960]  for Larry Elder because if he wins they're going to try to kill him just like Bolsonaro
[1:03:27.960 --> 1:03:36.160]  or anybody else so pray for Larry Elder, okay I want to go to your phone calls, Bill, Seth,
[1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:46.920]  Josh, Corey, Jennifer, Thomas, Daniel, Gerardo, Josh and others and we'll take calls right

[1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:32.840]  she's in the hospital right now she was tested positive for COVID about nine days ago and
[1:04:32.840 --> 1:04:38.320]  I listened to Dr. Sean Brooks and Lee Merritt and Dr. Francis Bull and several of them I've
[1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:43.600]  heard them talk about remdesivir and ivermectin and things but she's to the point now where
[1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:47.720]  they're saying that even intubating there is not really going to kill the doctor wasn't
[1:04:47.720 --> 1:04:52.120]  even open to trying ivermectin or remdesivir or anything I didn't know if there was any
[1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:57.200]  here well I mean well I mean that's the thing is remdesivir is recommended by Fauci and
[1:04:57.200 --> 1:05:02.600]  it doesn't work but about 8% of the time ivermectin by George Soros I'm not funded by the democratic

[1:06:27.320 --> 1:06:52.160]  I just started going to calls but I wasn't looking at the clock so we went to break and
[1:06:52.160 --> 1:06:56.560]  I apologize for that here on the Alex Jones show we're talking to Thomas in North Carolina
[1:06:56.560 --> 1:07:03.760]  whose mother-in-law is in the hospital they didn't give her Regeneron which works great
[1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:08.240]  by the way they didn't give her ivermectin which works amazing by the way they didn't
[1:07:08.240 --> 1:07:12.560]  give her hydroxychloroquine that works incredible they gave her nothing just like when Rob do
[1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:16.480]  went to the hospital because the family was concerned about him and he had you know low
[1:07:16.480 --> 1:07:21.480]  oxygen he's in there for a couple days no medicine no nothing they were just watching
[1:07:21.480 --> 1:07:28.720]  him and waiting till he failed to give him the intubation he went home got on a prescription
[1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:34.280]  that we got set up for him with ivermectin and with inhalable steroids and his oxygen
[1:07:34.280 --> 1:07:38.680]  went from 80 which is really back and kill you up to 90 something very very quickly
[1:07:38.680 --> 1:07:42.640]  he did still have some bloody lung damage and caught up some you know some some blood
[1:07:42.640 --> 1:07:52.200]  clots because that's what this stuff that's what this stuff does and so it's all about
[1:07:52.200 --> 1:07:56.920]  treatment Japan's main medical board in Tokyo where they invented ivermectin for humans
[1:07:56.920 --> 1:08:06.480]  by the way non horses like they tell you yes works on horses to antiviral anti parasite
[1:08:06.480 --> 1:08:13.120]  they found 100% of over 10,000 people that got on ivermectin right when they got the
[1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:17.960]  chest cold right when they couldn't breathe right when it feels like a 300 pound gorilla
[1:08:17.960 --> 1:08:23.520]  sitting on your chest that's what it feels like 100% and then the very same scientist
[1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:29.640]  on national Japanese TV put up the graphs in Africa where they hand out ivermectin twice
[1:08:29.640 --> 1:08:35.760]  a year almost no deaths from COVID and thousands of times higher deaths in the African countries
[1:08:35.760 --> 1:08:39.880]  that don't take ivermectin and everybody knows around the world it's it's it's incredible
[1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:46.280]  for antiviral for anti worms for anti everything people didn't just go oh let's try ivermectin
[1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:53.640]  for no reason so it's totally safe they know that they've tried to suppress Dr. Zalinko
[1:08:53.640 --> 1:09:00.720]  and everybody else and just make fun of it they go I ain't no horse so we just took the
[1:09:00.720 --> 1:09:04.400]  guys call recap what you were saying Thomas and I'm so sorry to hear this gave her nothing
[1:09:04.400 --> 1:09:09.080]  never did anything for now I also love this thing online I've seen the left do because
[1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:13.200]  I get sent these emails and people flag the stuff and I and I see it the top of Instagram
[1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:19.720]  and Twitter oh Jones is promoting rendezavir no I'm not rendezavir is something being pushed
[1:09:19.720 --> 1:09:25.920]  by Fauci what I have promoted is Regeneron I have no stock in Regeneron I have no stock
[1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:33.760]  period Regeneron the company has been around that produces it since the 80s they've got
[1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:39.920]  a bunch of patented stuff and it is a therapy that they create cloned white blood cells
[1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:48.720]  of mice and they train them in a vat of covid how to only defeat covid and then they put
[1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:53.680]  it your body it's what Trump took last year I know members of the crew that had covid
[1:09:53.680 --> 1:09:57.040]  that thought they were going to die they went and did rendezavir when it was still being
[1:09:57.040 --> 1:10:03.360]  charged the governor of Texas pays for it not rendezavir Regeneron and so the governor
[1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:08.760]  of Texas is doing a good thing it's paid for at these clinics but you've got to do it early
[1:10:08.760 --> 1:10:16.160]  and it's 100% Regeneron not rendezavir even I mixed the two up one is a drug Fauci pushes
[1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:23.960]  that has 8% efficacy Regeneron has 99 plus percent efficacy just like hydroxychloric
[1:10:23.960 --> 1:10:31.000]  one that pushes zinc into the cells so again they are suppressing these for the general
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:36.400]  public they don't want you know about vitamin D3 or vitamin zinc deficiencies how the majority
[1:10:36.400 --> 1:10:42.280]  of people dying had vitamin D deficiencies and even if the average person is getting
[1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:47.120]  30 minutes of sun a day you're not producing enough vitamin D and if you're black if you're
[1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:53.760]  African you need four times the sun and if you are a if you're background wherever you
[1:10:53.760 --> 1:11:00.400]  live in the world is from a equatorial African folks that are black black you better you better
[1:11:00.400 --> 1:11:04.280]  be on vitamin D3 and a lot of it because you can be out the sun all day long in northern
[1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:08.120]  clines and not get enough sun for yourself because the melanin blocks it getting in your
[1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:12.240]  body okay that's how important the sun is white people are white because we live up
[1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:15.640]  north we need to get more sun black people are black because they're getting too much
[1:11:15.640 --> 1:11:19.720]  sun but then when you live up towards the north it's going to kill you and that's why
[1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:24.800]  black people are twice as likely to die of these COVID diseases is because you do not
[1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:31.680]  have enough vitamin D3 I'm ranting I said I go to your phone calls it just makes me
[1:11:31.680 --> 1:11:42.440]  so angry that this is happening there it is African Americans at greater risk of vitamin
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:48.000]  D deficiency it's a fact and they sit on the news and go we don't know why the black people
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:55.080]  are dying twice as much from COVID because they live in urban jungles and live inside
[1:11:55.080 --> 1:12:00.440]  the average black person lives in a city now and they're unhealthy and the cities are full
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:06.880]  of particulates it's bad for anybody but if you're black and you're not on vitamin D3
[1:12:06.880 --> 1:12:18.560]  around you are crazy anyways I'm ranting it just pisses me off to hear this from this man
[1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:24.080]  talking about his mother-in-law fighting for her life and they're saying it's too late
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:28.280]  and the doctor he said never offered any of this because most hospitals won't because
[1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:35.120]  they get made fun of oh you ain't gonna you'll give us the horse stuff are you how many drugs
[1:12:35.120 --> 1:12:41.280]  do humans take did animals take to a lot it's the same stuff and they play that game ladies
[1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:45.480]  and gentlemen they play that game and they kill people because they want your ass dead
[1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:49.920]  this is a depopulation operation Thomas in North Carolina thanks for holding over tell
[1:12:49.920 --> 1:12:55.080]  us the story yes sir we've we've begged and pleaded for them to try anything hydroxy
[1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:59.800]  chloroquine you know I remember anything and they just they look at you like you're crazy
[1:12:59.800 --> 1:13:05.240]  it's almost like they they're incentivized to kill them I mean that I used to listen to
[1:13:05.240 --> 1:13:09.520]  a show and at first I was like man this guy's crazy but then over the years the more things
[1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:14.200]  I've heard you say it's like it just comes through one thing after another man well sir
[1:13:14.200 --> 1:13:19.320]  my people there is for lack of knowledge and I I don't just have my crew and friends and
[1:13:19.320 --> 1:13:23.160]  stuff they got sick they got better with all this their friends and others got sick and
[1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:28.000]  so we gave them an online pharmacy a bunch of different online pharmacies you can just
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:34.040]  go talk to a doctor online pay him 30 bucks and then pay for the stuff and so you can't
[1:13:34.040 --> 1:13:40.360]  trust these hospitals these are kill zones you've got to learn how to get the hydroxychloroquine
[1:13:40.360 --> 1:13:47.760]  how to get the ivermectin how to get all of this online you understand and don't everybody
[1:13:47.760 --> 1:13:53.360]  should be stockpiling it now in my view is there any way you could help me or like your
[1:13:53.360 --> 1:13:58.360]  call screener guy help direct me to somewhere like that online because I'm willing to do
[1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:03.440]  anything her oxygen is like 82 right now she's pretty much just holding on for her life man

[1:14:08.680 --> 1:14:13.960]  of these calls put them on hold I'm happy to do it give them to Rob do and Rob all day
[1:14:13.960 --> 1:14:18.960]  now just helps people people that help people that help people and we had a couple medical
[1:14:18.960 --> 1:14:22.800]  doctors in Texas that were doing hundreds of scripts for everybody and then they got
[1:14:22.800 --> 1:14:28.320]  overwhelmed one of them runs a Regeneron treatment center is having a hundred percent success
[1:14:28.320 --> 1:14:35.320]  as well and so they said listen just go to this online pharmacy and then you walk through
[1:14:35.320 --> 1:14:38.360]  it you tell them what your symptoms are and you tell them what you want an email they
[1:14:38.360 --> 1:14:43.480]  call you back in a couple hours and you tell them and just so guys everybody go to online
[1:14:43.480 --> 1:14:48.640]  pharmacies that's why the media confuses you and says don't get horse stuff it's the exact
[1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:53.880]  same molecule they'd rather her die then then you know you go to a tractor supply and get
[1:14:53.880 --> 1:14:58.840]  ivermectin for horses and then give her a pea size amount of it twice a day and I'm not
[1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:03.960]  giving medical treatment to your to your mother-in-law I'm not telling you what to do I'm saying
[1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:09.000]  the people perish for lack of knowledge and so if you live on the Mexico border you can

[1:23:26.520 --> 1:23:31.600]  um so they and I know for a fact that there are they lie to us and tell us that you know
[1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:38.320]  the un the unvaccinated are giving the vaccinated sick they say that there's not very many vaccinated
[1:23:38.320 --> 1:23:45.400]  actually in-house in the hospital sick which is a lie it's an absolute lie they I can tell
[1:23:45.400 --> 1:23:51.240]  you like last weekend in a four-hour span that one of the people four out of five patients
[1:23:51.240 --> 1:23:56.160]  that had a CAT scan were already COVID positive or I mean already vaccinated I'm sorry they're
[1:23:56.160 --> 1:24:00.120]  already vaccinated and they just lie and try to keep it from as that's exactly what a bunch
[1:24:00.120 --> 1:24:04.800]  of medical doctors have told me and medical doctors my parents were just talking to said
[1:24:04.800 --> 1:24:09.240]  there's all these vaccinated people that are sick there and then they're told cover it up
[1:24:09.240 --> 1:24:14.080]  and don't tell anybody and people the vaccinated are going blind they're having blood clots
[1:24:14.080 --> 1:24:18.080]  I mean this is just an Armageddon and and just like they help cover up the autistic
[1:24:18.080 --> 1:24:23.880]  or the Gulf War syndrome the nurses and the doctors did well in those beta tests so now
[1:24:23.880 --> 1:24:27.600]  the mass extermination is here and when they get sick and die it'll be covered up as well
[1:24:27.600 --> 1:24:32.440]  we'll all just keep quiet and do what we're told and be politically correct oh the the
[1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:37.280]  people are deep here let me tell you my boss was sick he's he's been vaccinated his son
[1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:40.920]  got sick he was vaccinated so his wife and his and his daughter and all they all were
[1:24:40.920 --> 1:24:44.600]  vaccinated and they all got COVID and they all just running around thinking oh well I
[1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:50.160]  guess it wasn't that bad because you know I got the vaccine it's just disgusting I mean
[1:24:50.160 --> 1:24:53.400]  I'm I'm trying to get out of here because I cannot work with these people anymore it's
[1:24:53.400 --> 1:24:57.880]  just obnoxiously ridiculous well Jennifer I don't know how you don't go into a rage
[1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:02.280]  because I legitimately was in a decent mood today I'm trying to be positive but I watch
[1:25:02.280 --> 1:25:06.680]  all these videos of paralyzed and dying people I know all these people personally that took
[1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:11.360]  the vaccines we're going blind now I mean I know all the literature I see them suppressing
[1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:16.040]  treatments and killing people and I'm just ashamed that there are so many people in the
[1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:22.200]  world that will follow these orders and do this it's just incredible dude they do I see
[1:25:22.200 --> 1:25:26.520]  it I see it go on all day long and it makes me freaking sick I can't even I mean I've
[1:25:26.520 --> 1:25:30.120]  worked with these people for 2025 years I can't even talk to them anymore they are so asleep
[1:25:30.120 --> 1:25:35.240]  I've tried to wake them up they I try to red pill them I've just done so I mean I'm obviously
[1:25:35.240 --> 1:25:39.440]  been looking for a few months on a position to get the hell out of this place because
[1:25:39.440 --> 1:25:44.880]  it is awful they're all asleep God bless you ma'am just keep trying to warn people let
[1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:49.600]  me guess though like you said earlier they're they're trying to cover up that it's the vaccinated
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:53.920]  that are sick are they telling you not to warn patients when they come in and are sick to
[1:25:53.920 --> 1:25:57.160]  even ask them if they've been vaccinated because that's what a doctor is telling me is they're
[1:25:57.160 --> 1:26:03.240]  told don't tell them it's the vaccine that made them sick she's gone all right let's
[1:26:03.240 --> 1:26:09.440]  go ahead and take another call let's talk to Josh in North Carolina Josh thanks for
[1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:17.320]  calling welcome hey brother how you doing man I'm just watching America divide into
[1:26:17.320 --> 1:26:20.040]  two groups the whole world divided into those that are going to follow the evil plan and
[1:26:20.040 --> 1:26:23.760]  those that are going to say no and it just physically made me mad you're that guy begging
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:27.360]  for help of course I want to help him it's just to know there's millions of people we
[1:26:27.360 --> 1:26:30.600]  can't even reach or warn and that they're going to just sit there and put people in
[1:26:30.600 --> 1:26:35.560]  the hospital and kill them they had a killed Rob do they gave him no medicine no IV no drugs
[1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:39.480]  of any type they just sat there and watched him waiting for him to have his lungs fill
[1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:45.800]  up and die knowing that COVID is an autoimmune response above all else they know full well
[1:26:45.800 --> 1:26:49.960]  steroids work a hundred percent you've early they know full well ivermectin works a hundred
[1:26:49.960 --> 1:26:54.680]  percent they know it and they want to murder you because they're murderers and they get
[1:26:54.680 --> 1:27:01.800]  away with it it's satanic these people are satanic I agree brother what's on your mind
[1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:06.320]  well I was just calling in and I know four people that died last week that were vaccinated
[1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:11.080]  one one lady was vaccinated a month later she got COVID she died she was she had both
[1:27:11.080 --> 1:27:16.520]  I don't know which which shot it was but she had both doses and they put her on the ventilator
[1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:22.360]  and she passed away that's that's one of my best friends and and I know another girl she
[1:27:22.360 --> 1:27:28.840]  was about 30 years old perfectly healthy three days after she got the second shot she's dead
[1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:33.640]  I know another man he was perfectly healthy three days after he got the shot he's dead
[1:27:33.640 --> 1:27:38.120]  I mean it's just everywhere I turn I know you know I hear these stories it's just it's incredible
[1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:44.200]  and those are I'm the same way I know a lot of people died and all these famous people
[1:27:44.200 --> 1:27:48.360]  died and the first guy to take the vaccine died and they're just dying everywhere they go oh we
[1:27:48.360 --> 1:27:53.480]  don't know and suddenly the life expectancy this year not last year has just dropped by two years
[1:27:54.120 --> 1:27:58.360]  and by the end of the year this is going to drop like five because they are murdering us
[1:27:59.560 --> 1:28:03.880]  well you know they say whenever you get COVID the people that are vaccinated they have milder
[1:28:03.880 --> 1:28:08.840]  symptoms but what happened to the people that were asymptomatic last year that they got COVID
[1:28:08.840 --> 1:28:14.520]  they were transmitted but they didn't show signs or the symptoms I mean I mean you know what happened
[1:28:14.520 --> 1:28:19.640]  to most people you don't hear about asymptomatic people the unvaccinated people they're just saying
[1:28:19.640 --> 1:28:25.560]  it's because of the vaccine they didn't have as bad of symptoms that makes sense absolutely that
[1:28:25.560 --> 1:28:30.120]  and that's all a lie first oh it totally protects you it'll be totally protected their own literature
[1:28:30.120 --> 1:28:33.880]  they knew it was a gene therapy it wouldn't protect you and then they're like oh well it makes you
[1:28:33.880 --> 1:28:39.160]  less sick when you've had it that's not how it works a vaccine either works so you don't get it
[1:28:39.160 --> 1:28:44.600]  because your body defeats it or it doesn't but these aren't vaccines it's all a lie it's all a
[1:28:44.600 --> 1:28:49.320]  plan to trap us to get rid of our immune systems and take over keep warning people josh god bless

[1:33:31.640 --> 1:33:36.280]  just can't take the globalist and their criminal activity anymore and i've studied too much
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:41.640]  i know too much about all of this and i know what their agenda is and i know what they're
[1:33:41.640 --> 1:33:46.920]  doing to us and i and i know it's got to stop and we've got to get angry and and know they're
[1:33:46.920 --> 1:33:52.200]  hurting us into a world id a social credit score a medical tracking app and they've announced now
[1:33:52.200 --> 1:33:57.640]  now at the un and at the us level and at the australian level that oh we're going to give you
[1:33:57.640 --> 1:34:01.320]  shots every few months you're never going to have freedom again things never go back to normal
[1:34:01.320 --> 1:34:07.240]  and they start laughing these damn bureaucrats controlling us through medical fear so they
[1:34:07.240 --> 1:34:12.920]  want to bankrupt local businesses they want to go after the local businesses they want to
[1:34:12.920 --> 1:34:16.920]  bankrupt the economies and bring in a universal income to control people so now they're saying
[1:34:16.920 --> 1:34:22.920]  oh we forgive everybody's mortgages or you know we forgive everybody's rents and then that causes
[1:34:22.920 --> 1:34:28.840]  a collapse in the housing market so they can consolidate control and who says that the cdc
[1:34:28.840 --> 1:34:39.240]  who made them god who made them god and now the cdc wants your guns they say oh it's not about um
[1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:45.480]  gun control it's about taking the guns away to keep you safe it's a medical thing we're doing
[1:34:45.480 --> 1:34:51.000]  the globalists are coming with medical tyranny and and in the mainstream pop news it's like oh
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:55.480]  biden says you should take a booster one time but in the policy reports they say it's going to be
[1:34:55.480 --> 1:35:02.120]  every five months for the rest of your life you better get used to it they say i already played
[1:35:02.120 --> 1:35:10.040]  last hour let's go to franando in arizona thank you for holding franando welcome
[1:35:10.040 --> 1:35:17.000]  good morning alex thanks for taking my call thank you sir all right so my mom took the
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:24.280]  Pfizer jab and shortly after she developed these shingle type welts on her back they're black and
[1:35:24.280 --> 1:35:32.840]  pink and so i filed a report with bears i never heard anything back and um you know i the the
[1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:39.080]  kind of problems that were seen with um with the manipulation and censorship and failure to
[1:35:39.080 --> 1:35:47.320]  actually report the way it's supposed to um i created a decentralized uh sensor proof open
[1:35:47.320 --> 1:35:54.520]  vaccine injury reporting system using info wars domain um at backsaction.com
[1:35:57.640 --> 1:36:01.880]  well i'm glad you're reporting it sir what do you what do you think's going on here
[1:36:01.880 --> 1:36:12.920]  well uh i think that they are crushing the opportunity for the public to develop or formulate
[1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:20.040]  or form um informed consent the predicate for informed consent is the information that we need
[1:36:20.760 --> 1:36:26.920]  based on clinical trials which we all know don't exist at this point so i think it's imperative
[1:36:26.920 --> 1:36:35.080]  that people report any kind of uh adverse reaction or injury in a manner that can uh be
[1:36:35.800 --> 1:36:43.480]  that can be retained and reviewed and analyzed uh in posterity absolutely and i love how they
[1:36:43.480 --> 1:36:48.680]  have opinion pieces at cnn saying you don't have the constitutional right refuse the covid vaccine
[1:36:48.680 --> 1:36:53.960]  a it's not a vaccine i have total rights under law to refuse any medical treatment i want
[1:36:53.960 --> 1:36:57.800]  you don't have an authorization to give me something that lowers my immunity
[1:36:57.800 --> 1:37:03.240]  try to take control of my life this is big pharma merged with big media and big tech is one big
[1:37:03.240 --> 1:37:08.920]  business to literally have a corporate medicine model that takes over the planet and makes us
[1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:15.000]  take whatever they want into our bodies on a routine basis for the right to commerce and to travel
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:20.440]  and to live i mean this is as nightmarish as it can get what does your mother think after she got
[1:37:20.440 --> 1:37:27.800]  shingles which they admit the so-called covid vaccine does by creating these spike proteins
[1:37:28.440 --> 1:37:32.600]  in your body that it basically creates the same thing as herpes all over the body
[1:37:33.800 --> 1:37:44.200]  alex she refuses to acknowledge the correlation or the causation or uh she's just completely
[1:37:44.200 --> 1:37:51.480]  Stockholm completely disconnected and um probably uh you know uh more than willing to go in for
[1:37:51.480 --> 1:38:00.040]  booster round so uh you know we've identified this as a depopulation maneuver by the global
[1:38:00.040 --> 1:38:07.400]  corporate cabal correct yes sir order to in order to prosecute at some point in the future
[1:38:07.400 --> 1:38:12.360]  which i think is something that we all want all of your listeners anybody engaged in this issue
[1:38:12.360 --> 1:38:19.320]  you there's going to need to be evidence and they're systematically memory holding every case
[1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:26.200]  or manipulating it uh that's right this is all an exercise in depopulation to see if they can get
[1:38:26.200 --> 1:38:30.600]  away with it first the autistic uh you know the troops being tested all the experimental shots
[1:38:30.600 --> 1:38:35.240]  covering up their deaths and they got away with that so now they're going for the big one so what
[1:38:35.240 --> 1:38:45.080]  do we do franando we create a living record at vaxaction.com if you or somebody that you know
[1:38:45.080 --> 1:38:50.680]  your if you're a next of kin or uh somebody that you love has been injured by vaccination
[1:38:51.320 --> 1:38:55.640]  report it file a report you don't even have to include your real name just give us an email that
[1:38:55.640 --> 1:39:01.480]  works all right beautifully said we're going to take what you said and put it out as one of the
[1:39:01.480 --> 1:39:06.680]  videos that airs during the breaks to inform people absolutely briefly i'm aware of that site tell
[1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:12.200]  folks what their mission is and why it's important i would also encourage go to city council go to
[1:39:12.200 --> 1:39:18.760]  school committee uh go to the county commissioners meetings go to the school boards and and use every
[1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:24.280]  public venue to speak out and put it on record there and post it on twitter facebook you name it
[1:39:24.280 --> 1:39:32.200]  everybody's got to go and and and speak out against this thank you alex yeah our mission is simply to

[1:40:24.920 --> 1:40:31.880]  yeah thank you alex and uh good afternoon to every uh you and your staff are and uh and i
[1:40:31.880 --> 1:40:41.640]  just want to say kudos to uh rob do for recovering uh his little symptom are and and my prayers and
[1:40:41.640 --> 1:40:47.080]  to those who are adversely affected from the uh so-called hurricane uh down south there it's
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:53.800]  heading up this way toward where we're at but uh thank you for taking my call though alex yeah i was
[1:40:53.800 --> 1:41:03.880]  wanting to talk about the uh particular uh FDA approval of the Pfizer vaccine first of all well
[1:41:03.880 --> 1:41:13.400]  there's an article by greg hunter usa watchdog.com uh stipulating uh about how the FDA lied in its
[1:41:13.400 --> 1:41:23.640]  title FDA lied back not approved still experimental and they did not approve the uh Pfizer vaccine
[1:41:23.640 --> 1:41:29.640]  what they did is they extended it uh emergency use authorization absolutely it's all a giant
[1:41:29.640 --> 1:41:35.320]  hopes i've had lawyers on about it robert barnes and others it is a new class where they just extended
[1:41:35.320 --> 1:41:41.480]  the emergency authorization and said that they'll announce the trials in 2025 absolutely a total
[1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:47.400]  fraud as usual nothing but lies because these are globalist we are their enemies they are bombarding
[1:41:47.400 --> 1:41:56.280]  us literally with lies and bio weapons correct and what they approved is is called comarity uh two
[1:41:56.280 --> 1:42:02.760]  two countries is uh uh exercise in this particular one is so one is europe and one is olspheria
[1:42:03.560 --> 1:42:12.840]  comarity is what they approved not the uh not the Pfizer um also dr robert malone he can also
[1:42:12.840 --> 1:42:19.160]  stipulate the following i think red hunter has his video on there where he states uh that are
[1:42:19.160 --> 1:42:26.280]  two things that they approved of all they did is extend it so what what my point of the matter is
[1:42:26.280 --> 1:42:33.560]  with them just extending it see that don't throw out the no liability clause say if they approved
[1:42:33.560 --> 1:42:38.440]  this vaccine the no liability clause will be thrown out the window that's right so now they're
[1:42:38.440 --> 1:42:43.080]  doing a no man's land where it's really experimental with no liability but then they claim it's not
[1:42:43.080 --> 1:42:49.080]  which is total fraud great point sir thank you so much for bringing that up uh everybody should
[1:42:49.080 --> 1:42:54.680]  find that article real quick what was the title of the article again he dropped more calls straight

[1:43:59.080 --> 1:44:04.600]  i first started taking survival skills basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had brain fog
[1:44:04.600 --> 1:44:09.640]  like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard dr group on their show and i
[1:44:09.640 --> 1:44:14.120]  listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked
[1:44:14.120 --> 1:44:18.280]  pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with x2 you know with a deep burden
[1:44:18.280 --> 1:44:22.920]  source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it and then in two weeks i went from
[1:44:22.920 --> 1:44:29.000]  brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know i could think again i could
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:34.200]  connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years i got my health back
[1:44:34.200 --> 1:44:38.280]  and i religiously take basically all of your supplements they're they're all absolutely

[1:44:42.680 --> 1:44:47.080]  just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean
[1:44:47.080 --> 1:44:51.800]  we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own
[1:44:51.800 --> 1:44:56.520]  health into our own hands beautifully said brother i thank you so much for your call and godspeed
[1:44:56.520 --> 1:45:04.920]  humanity is the main stakeholder on this planet but the big corporations for a hundred years
[1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:08.840]  have told us that humans are bad and evil and the passports on the earth so that we begin to
[1:45:08.840 --> 1:45:13.720]  believe we're bad and we'll turn off our life force and let the eugenics-based globalists
[1:45:13.720 --> 1:45:19.080]  take control of the planet if you let a clown swab the evidence groups own wikipedia page
[1:45:19.080 --> 1:45:24.840]  he brags on there about how they're capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide
[1:45:24.840 --> 1:45:31.080]  to set up a corporate dictatorship under the un they admit all of this they plan the lockdowns
[1:45:31.080 --> 1:45:37.240]  they release the viruses they think you're stupid and their plan is to slowly cut off the resources
[1:45:37.240 --> 1:45:42.680]  so they can dictate total social control over you and your lives that's how i was able to predict
[1:45:42.680 --> 1:45:49.720]  everything they did decades before they executed it word for word with total precision because they

[1:51:31.880 --> 1:51:38.120]  uh we're not gonna allow the government to go against our own free will well so the department
[1:51:38.120 --> 1:51:41.560]  of transportation is trying to claim it's not mandatory but they're trying to make you do it
[1:51:41.560 --> 1:51:47.480]  for your license right well i didn't know it yet i didn't know it had gone that far that's outrageous

[1:52:11.560 --> 1:52:18.200]  fact i've heard about it august 31st 2021 truckers unite in solidarity with australia and the usa and
[1:52:18.200 --> 1:52:21.800]  around the world now are you going to strike or are you going to go to blue cities and block the
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:29.080]  highways i know it uh all depends on uh on what everybody else decides to do i guess you know we're
[1:52:29.080 --> 1:52:34.360]  going to join join hands and hell we might just shut down the shut down the interstate travel system
[1:52:35.160 --> 1:52:41.640]  i'd love to see a shut dc down there once before we did we we did it before we'll do it again
[1:52:42.280 --> 1:52:46.600]  we were there last year now's the time to push back against these criminals okay tell us your
[1:52:46.600 --> 1:52:53.880]  uh covid story all right so i went in uh this was friday i went in to go get my uh my department
[1:52:53.880 --> 1:53:01.160]  transportation regulated uh ordered federally you know federal rules and law states i have to have a
[1:53:02.120 --> 1:53:07.400]  i have to have a do t physical uh every year or two depending on what the doc the last doctor
[1:53:07.400 --> 1:53:15.720]  ordered so uh i'm due at the end of the i'm due today uh i was due for a physical and uh so i
[1:53:15.720 --> 1:53:21.800]  went in there to go get my physical done i walk inside no mask i refuse to wear a mask i'm not
[1:53:21.800 --> 1:53:28.040]  going to be forced into doing something i don't feel free of doing anyways uh long story short
[1:53:28.840 --> 1:53:36.200]  they wouldn't let me go be go to see a doctor so and i was causing this i was causing an argument
[1:53:36.200 --> 1:53:42.040]  so i they called they told me to get out of the building i left i went outside they called cops
[1:53:42.040 --> 1:53:48.680]  cops got there uh first one was just some private or something i don't know uh he's new on the job
[1:53:48.680 --> 1:53:56.760]  or something i had to teach him uh what he missed in school however uh he he starts off well uh
[1:53:56.760 --> 1:54:03.560]  it's a private business and i told them uh well actually let's go ahead and uh let's go ahead and
[1:54:03.560 --> 1:54:09.240]  get this clear it's not a private organization uh that's federally funded they've received at least
[1:54:09.240 --> 1:54:14.760]  one penny from the federal government which makes them a federally funded uh organization so on so
[1:54:14.760 --> 1:54:18.440]  forth that's right they're trying to make you go through this licensure and now they're trying to
[1:54:18.440 --> 1:54:23.400]  make you jump through more hoops they're holding everyone hostage and people better figure out paying
[1:54:24.040 --> 1:54:31.880]  terrorist only makes them behave worse we've got to all stop complying so i got the officer he got
[1:54:31.880 --> 1:54:37.960]  us he got a supervisor out there supervisor shows up they both wear and dash or uh body cams the
[1:54:37.960 --> 1:54:44.360]  whole time so let's make that known i got them both to admit under uh so first this the supervisor
[1:54:44.360 --> 1:54:54.760]  comes in and he's like well um you know i i i made the case of that i was being uh denied uh emergency
[1:54:54.760 --> 1:55:01.800]  medical services all right and uh he's like well uh i don't see a medical emergency with you i said
[1:55:01.800 --> 1:55:09.800]  well have you examined me yet so let me ask this how did it all end well uh they agreed that the
[1:55:09.800 --> 1:55:15.400]  that my civil rights were that with their dash cam uh their words were that my civil rights were
[1:55:15.400 --> 1:55:23.960]  imposed uh that they were infringed upon uh also um it was it could be a form of discrimination
[1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:33.560]  and uh they they wouldn't treat me due to they can't tell me if uh i couldn't go before a doctor
[1:55:33.560 --> 1:55:41.080]  to get examined and so how did it all end how did it all end uh well long story short uh i got in

[1:57:54.280 --> 1:57:59.000]  being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people i've been trying
[1:57:59.000 --> 1:58:05.640]  to get ahold of you for a year okay i'm a double amputee and i have bacteria infection on my
[1:58:05.640 --> 1:58:11.960]  lung that'll never go away uh living defense saved my life they had me on antibiotics for two years
[1:58:11.960 --> 1:58:17.480]  that almost killed me living defense brought me back i wanted to just quote from the bible
[1:58:17.480 --> 1:58:24.600]  jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you
[1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:32.120]  up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake
[1:58:32.120 --> 1:58:37.960]  and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another that's
[1:58:37.960 --> 1:58:42.520]  right where we're at brother and that's because god's name is on the founding of this country no
[1:58:42.520 --> 1:58:49.720]  matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because god created this country in late
[1:58:49.720 --> 1:58:57.160]  august infill war saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalist
[1:58:57.160 --> 1:59:03.640]  are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial

[2:00:09.560 --> 2:00:15.000]  from 11 a.m to 3 p.m central i'm live you had a very special guest joining us next segment we're
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:21.480]  going back to your calls right now in the order they were received let's talk to josh in Missouri
[2:00:21.480 --> 2:00:27.240]  josh thanks for holding go ahead yeah first down call a long time listener thanks again for checking
[2:00:27.240 --> 2:00:38.280]  on call thank you but what's on your mind josh it's the fact that i work in an er and i'm not
[2:00:38.280 --> 2:00:43.960]  medical staff but i work right alongside doctors and nurses and they are never wearing gowns they
[2:00:43.960 --> 2:00:50.360]  are never wearing masks they we all know this is covered as a joke they don't bother with wearing
[2:00:50.360 --> 2:00:54.200]  gowns they don't bother with wearing gloves they don't put on the mask when they go in these patients
[2:00:54.200 --> 2:01:00.920]  rooms the doctors one of the first things they ask whenever the older 60 65 years patients come in
[2:01:00.920 --> 2:01:05.080]  with signs of seizure or blood clots if they did they get the shot they had a shot it's like the
[2:01:05.080 --> 2:01:09.800]  first thing on your mind and that was my main point i wanted to get wow so so you work at a hospital
[2:01:09.800 --> 2:01:13.960]  and they just know right up front when people come in with blood clots now to ask if they have the shot
[2:01:14.680 --> 2:01:19.880]  it's one of the first things that they asked the nurse to find out when they had to have the shot
[2:01:19.880 --> 2:01:25.960]  and is that why we see all the nurses and doctors not wanting to take it uh it's about a 50 50 split
[2:01:25.960 --> 2:01:29.400]  where i am i'm in i'm in Missouri so you know a little more conservative side but i do hear
[2:01:29.400 --> 2:01:32.600]  doctors saying that they will be walked out of the hospital before they take the shot so
[2:01:34.360 --> 2:01:38.040]  well i know this brother last year we had the same number of people die that year that died
[2:01:38.040 --> 2:01:42.760]  the year before which means less people die as the population went up this year the population's
[2:01:42.760 --> 2:01:48.040]  plunging and in florida and texas they're stacking dead bodies up like cordwood and i've talked to
[2:01:48.040 --> 2:01:52.680]  former heads of us intelligence agencies i've talked to doctors on the ground they believe
[2:01:52.680 --> 2:01:57.720]  there's some type of prion simulant because it doesn't test positive for covid that's been sprayed
[2:01:57.720 --> 2:02:03.960]  out on us to get us in line with biden that's because i'm glad to hear most areas of the country
[2:02:03.960 --> 2:02:08.520]  are not dealing with this but let me tell you it's not fun in texas or florida they they they
[2:02:08.520 --> 2:02:12.120]  know that we opened up they knew we bucked them and they released something down here brother
[2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:17.480]  my thought on this is that uh they're trying to get so many people vaccinated so quickly
[2:02:17.480 --> 2:02:21.800]  that within both two or two and a half years that it takes people to start actually dying
[2:02:21.800 --> 2:02:25.560]  then it's it's going to be too late where all of our frontline workers are going to be gone
[2:02:25.560 --> 2:02:29.480]  truckers everybody getting forced to take this is going to be gone and then what's left the real
[2:02:29.480 --> 2:02:36.840]  enemy the unvaccinated absolutely they want to soften us up for for the race war global collapse
[2:02:37.400 --> 2:02:41.160]  and and and and they know whatever the crisis is they're going to have going in a few years
[2:02:41.160 --> 2:02:44.600]  there's all these top scientists say they believe within three years you'll start seeing mass death
[2:02:44.600 --> 2:02:49.080]  we're already seeing mass death but but they look at the rat studies you know took a few months so
[2:02:49.080 --> 2:02:53.960]  they they spaced that out to a few years whatever it is they've got planned is so bad in the future
[2:02:53.960 --> 2:02:59.000]  they think we'll be so distracted we won't even ask why half the population's dying
[2:03:00.600 --> 2:03:05.800]  thank you for that i know a lot of cases are are failing based on the nuremberg code and
[2:03:05.800 --> 2:03:10.920]  things of that nature but i'm wondering if a supreme court case that could set the percent
[2:03:10.920 --> 2:03:14.840]  of mortality that there's what have to be before these things can be mandated i mean this is a 99
[2:03:14.840 --> 2:03:20.200]  percent recoverable disease or virus or even if it's even if it's a real thing so i just don't
[2:03:20.200 --> 2:03:25.560]  understand how we're going along with 99 recovery rate and being mandated to take these shots well
[2:03:25.560 --> 2:03:33.560]  it's because it's not a vaccine it's a genetic takeover and if you if you look at the supreme court
[2:03:33.560 --> 2:03:37.720]  ruling they had over a hundred years ago that so they could do forced inoculations that was the
[2:03:37.720 --> 2:03:42.760]  same supreme court that said you could sterilize black people and poor white people and so that
[2:03:42.760 --> 2:03:47.800]  was overturned later and we had not just the nuremberg code we have federal and state laws as well
[2:03:47.800 --> 2:03:52.200]  against making people take experimental injections that's why they've announced that it's approved
[2:03:52.200 --> 2:03:59.240]  now but again as the earlier caller said it was not actually approved and so there is just a lot
[2:04:00.680 --> 2:04:05.800]  of information going on but yeah we've got a lot of shameful rulings like buck versus bell
[2:04:06.840 --> 2:04:11.400]  for sterilization of the public and they've got some earlier rulings as well well just keeps
[2:04:11.400 --> 2:04:18.120]  spreading the word and god bless you josh look josh is bringing up common sense things and josh is
[2:04:18.120 --> 2:04:22.200]  saying this doesn't make sense why are we doing this well it's because it's part of a larger plan
[2:04:23.400 --> 2:04:27.880]  of having these injections every five to six months that again lower your immune system down to
[2:04:27.880 --> 2:04:33.800]  nothing and now you're controlled by the system this is a genetic medical takeover all right we
[2:04:33.800 --> 2:04:39.480]  have her dr lee mignon joining us she's one of the biggest guests you can get out there she's written

[2:06:26.360 --> 2:06:32.200]  welcome back we are now into hour number three of this august 30th
[2:06:32.200 --> 2:06:41.080]  monday broadcast and we are joined by a leading chinese virologist who has been totally and
[2:06:41.080 --> 2:06:45.320]  completely vindicated she's come out in the latest article in new york post has found
[2:06:45.320 --> 2:06:54.120]  she emails verify her wuhan lab leak claim li ming yan is the doctor and she's written a
[2:06:54.120 --> 2:07:00.120]  detailed report that has been proven to be a blueprint of what really happened she's on twitter
[2:07:00.120 --> 2:07:05.960]  at doctor li ming yan one people should be sure and follow her there at doctor li
[2:07:06.760 --> 2:07:13.480]  li ming yan one and we can put that up on screen there that is for you she also has linked up
[2:07:13.480 --> 2:07:22.200]  there her report sars kov2 is an unrestricted bio weapon a truth revealed through uncovering a large
[2:07:22.200 --> 2:07:27.960]  scale organized scientific fraud and it would take me an hour to go over her whole bio but
[2:07:27.960 --> 2:07:32.440]  let me just read part of it dr li ming yan is a medical doctor phd virologist independent
[2:07:32.440 --> 2:07:38.280]  corona virus expert she was educated at two top medical schools in china southern medical
[2:07:38.280 --> 2:07:42.840]  university and central south university she was also a postdoctoral fellow in the school of public
[2:07:42.840 --> 2:07:49.960]  health the university of hong kong because of her extensive uh professional network and scientific
[2:07:49.960 --> 2:07:55.640]  evidence dr yan has the distinction of being the only chinese insider in the west with firsthand
[2:07:55.640 --> 2:08:01.880]  knowledge about the true nature of the virus as well as the ccps deceptive methods used in disguise
[2:08:03.080 --> 2:08:12.440]  their international bio weapons research since escaping from hong kong on april 28 2021 she has
[2:08:12.440 --> 2:08:18.440]  been interviewed many many times four times by the fbi including fbi virologist and each time she
[2:08:18.440 --> 2:08:25.160]  has been deemed credible dr yan has spent five years researching influenza vaccines when january
[2:08:25.160 --> 2:08:32.040]  2020 she was asked to investigate the wuhan pneumonia that was sweeping the city and then it goes on
[2:08:32.040 --> 2:08:37.960]  from there she can tell you the rest of the story about the ccp and and and what she witnessed
[2:08:37.960 --> 2:08:44.280]  and what unfolded so dr yan thank you so much for coming on with us thank you anix thank you for
[2:08:44.280 --> 2:08:50.360]  having me every time i see on fox or newsmax you get about five minutes you've got the rest of the
[2:08:50.360 --> 2:08:55.960]  hour your gracious to be here we got like eight minutes to break start at the beginning or or
[2:08:55.960 --> 2:09:00.440]  give us a summation whatever you'd like to tell us we want to get it on record we really appreciate
[2:09:00.440 --> 2:09:04.680]  you coming on because we know that you've been right from the very very beginning and we appreciate
[2:09:04.680 --> 2:09:12.440]  your courage thank you alex then how about we start to talk about the intellectual uh report
[2:09:12.440 --> 2:09:19.800]  from biden's administration which was released last friday on origin of koei 19 how about we
[2:09:19.800 --> 2:09:29.480]  start talk from that absolutely please okay so according to that report biden administration
[2:09:29.480 --> 2:09:39.400]  said they judged that this koei 19 virus was not designed as a bioweapon and also the intelligence
[2:09:39.400 --> 2:09:47.960]  agencies all think there is a more confidence that it is not bioengineered uh uh lab products
[2:09:47.960 --> 2:09:55.400]  so actually i think there are many media i mean almost all the media try to explain this report
[2:09:55.400 --> 2:10:03.000]  but they actually made some misunderstanding because although they claim that this is not
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:11.800]  designed as a bioweapon it is not wrong because the recent evidence verified my reports and my
[2:10:11.800 --> 2:10:20.760]  evidence that the koei 19 virus is not designed as traditional bioweapon it is designed as
[2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:30.920]  unrestricted bioweapon this term is beyond bioweapon and this is because unlimited means that
[2:10:30.920 --> 2:10:38.760]  ccp won't do anything without limitations without constraints and without considering
[2:10:38.760 --> 2:10:47.880]  of humanity to make the novel non-traditional bioweapon and mix it with bioterrorism to
[2:10:47.880 --> 2:10:57.320]  conquer their uh uh conquer their goal of making china great and also overcome the world everything
[2:10:57.320 --> 2:11:05.720]  is under the instruction of maxism so this is what we should let more people know because
[2:11:05.720 --> 2:11:12.920]  the outerm of bioweapon had its limitation and the china government learned how to
[2:11:12.920 --> 2:11:19.720]  take advantage of the weakness from the house and from the surveillance and then to get
[2:11:19.720 --> 2:11:26.760]  a void of the surveillance and the biodefense system all over the world to conduct this biotech
[2:11:28.920 --> 2:11:34.120]  wow that is powerful information so work obviously they work with collaborators in the west i think
[2:11:34.120 --> 2:11:37.800]  that's very clear you go off what you know about china what you know about the weapon
[2:11:37.800 --> 2:11:44.440]  but i have clips we'll play later of dr peter dazik that ran the program with fauqi and with
[2:11:44.440 --> 2:11:50.840]  the chinese government and he was bragging in in december of 2019 that they were merging five
[2:11:50.840 --> 2:11:58.040]  viruses they were going to make a vaccine for it and he describes covid 19 so uh they weren't even
[2:11:58.040 --> 2:12:06.920]  hiding a lot of this it looks like yes from last february since peter dazik started to publish his
[2:12:06.920 --> 2:12:14.600]  unset statement claimed that covid 19 is from nature and also said china has done great
[2:12:14.600 --> 2:12:22.680]  job in anti-covid 19 he already exposed at that time i also had the first hand that
[2:12:22.680 --> 2:12:29.000]  information that he tried to organize the scientists all over the world to help china
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:37.480]  peter dazik is not in nonsent dr fauqi is not in nonsent dr faric christine anderson all these
[2:12:37.480 --> 2:12:45.160]  people are not in nonsent but sadly they are used by chinese government as a tool so chinese
[2:12:45.160 --> 2:12:53.080]  communist parties spend decades which is approved by my recent documents from 1990s they start to
[2:12:53.080 --> 2:13:01.640]  study the novel things in fauqi weapon and the fauqi war program and these people from american
[2:13:01.640 --> 2:13:09.960]  they are used by china to get money and technology and also support from international scientific
[2:13:09.960 --> 2:13:18.760]  world to spread misinformation they don't uh they are not allowed to touch the core intelligence
[2:13:19.480 --> 2:13:25.880]  in china because chinese communist parties don't trust these foreigners but they are used and they
[2:13:25.880 --> 2:13:33.880]  enjoy it and this is a benefit so they are waiting to do that with china to undermine america to
[2:13:33.880 --> 2:13:40.920]  undermine all the world and they're certainly working with the un and tedris and working with
[2:13:40.920 --> 2:13:45.480]  leftist here who want to keep us locked down who want to bring in a communist revolution who want
[2:13:45.480 --> 2:13:50.840]  to create a universal income i mean the democrats now admit most of the health department leaders
[2:13:50.840 --> 2:13:56.360]  are a vowed communist not just tedris but others that run london and run all these other big
[2:13:56.360 --> 2:14:01.400]  cities they say we're communist we don't want the lockdown to ever end in the west so clearly
[2:14:01.400 --> 2:14:09.320]  they're using it as a smoke screen for martial law yes you are right because from the reason the
[2:14:09.320 --> 2:14:16.920]  evidence i won't explain to your audience today they clearly told that the mandate is very useful
[2:14:16.920 --> 2:14:24.600]  because compared to america china has the power to mandate everything and they predict that once
[2:14:24.600 --> 2:14:34.360]  such novel bio warfare or bioterrorism happen people in america cannot get enough help i mean
[2:14:34.360 --> 2:14:41.080]  in time because this is democratic country and in china they can control it because that is
[2:14:41.080 --> 2:14:49.720]  centralized and also to use mandate as a tool to divide american divide republican democratic
[2:14:49.720 --> 2:14:57.960]  people divide races divide your policy is what china banned decades to work on incredible
[2:14:58.600 --> 2:15:03.640]  dr lee ming yon stay right there is the best place for people to find you on twitter at

[2:20:14.920 --> 2:20:33.240]  Dr. Lee Ming Yin is our guest she is completely vindicated she was the first voices to come out
[2:20:34.200 --> 2:20:39.240]  early last year and say it's a bio weapon out of Wuhan the chai comms have co-opted
[2:20:39.240 --> 2:20:45.400]  people inside the u.s. government inside the un and now she's been vindicated the u.s. intelligence
[2:20:45.400 --> 2:20:52.680]  agencies have come out and even john hopkins that came up with the spars event four years ago
[2:20:52.680 --> 2:20:57.160]  war gaming what's currently happening now heavily involved in all this as well as this is a global
[2:20:57.160 --> 2:21:01.320]  government project china is at the heart of it obviously they've come out and attacked her and
[2:21:01.320 --> 2:21:07.080]  said oh it didn't come out of a lab we've had peter dazik who helped secretly write the landsuit
[2:21:07.080 --> 2:21:12.120]  reports saying it didn't come out of the lab but told people in emails don't tell people i'm involved
[2:21:12.120 --> 2:21:17.960]  writing this he's finally been fired off of the latest whitewash so they have worked around the
[2:21:17.960 --> 2:21:26.440]  clock to try to stop dr. yan but she is with us now uh and uh going over why this happened where
[2:21:26.440 --> 2:21:31.640]  this is going and i also want to ask you because you've been on top of this like nobody else how
[2:21:31.640 --> 2:21:38.600]  do you counter something like this because when you say unrestricted warfare unrestricted bioweapon
[2:21:39.160 --> 2:21:44.440]  explain what that means it doesn't mean you just spray it on your enemy you just release it out of
[2:21:44.440 --> 2:21:49.400]  the open because you're premeditated you know what your response is going to be and you believe it'll
[2:21:49.400 --> 2:21:55.400]  divide and conquer and destroy open free societies which then our media even advertised and said
[2:21:55.400 --> 2:21:59.880]  oh america and europe can't be free anymore we've got to be like china we've got to have a social
[2:21:59.880 --> 2:22:06.040]  credit score we've got to listen to them we even saw the pr prepared and as americans and others
[2:22:06.040 --> 2:22:11.960]  got censored and as you got censored i saw communist chinese propaganda force fed by big tech
[2:22:14.040 --> 2:22:22.120]  oh hi alex this is a good question unrestricted means as what i said no constraints no consideration
[2:22:22.120 --> 2:22:31.160]  of humanity so china's unrestricted strategies not only applied on bioweapon hovay 19 is their
[2:22:31.160 --> 2:22:39.240]  unrestricted bioweapon but as i defend in my yin reports there are also unrestricted scientific
[2:22:39.240 --> 2:22:45.800]  misinformation and also there are unrestricted informative wars as we say we were censored
[2:22:45.800 --> 2:22:52.280]  and also misinformation spreading anywhere everywhere let me tell you you just talk about
[2:22:52.280 --> 2:23:00.120]  john hovkins and also dr fochy so my evidence actually based on my first hand intelligence
[2:23:00.120 --> 2:23:08.760]  from china military and civil network uh involved house detail cdc and also research labs also
[2:23:08.760 --> 2:23:16.760]  involved my knowledge about the wHO experts who work with me in the wHO reference lab in hong kong
[2:23:16.760 --> 2:23:23.640]  for five years and also there are other evidence like the people's vibration armies document
[2:23:23.640 --> 2:23:30.200]  scientific evidence they published from military and also civilian scientist network working with
[2:23:30.200 --> 2:23:38.920]  china all together combined with my expertise like niaid conducted by fochy and also john hovkins
[2:23:38.920 --> 2:23:45.880]  as you mentioned why do they attack me and why do they help china to promote the nature origin
[2:23:45.880 --> 2:23:54.120]  theory of kovay 19 is also very fine in the new evidence i won't tell you in the new evidence it
[2:23:54.120 --> 2:24:03.400]  is a document from people's vibration army from end of 2014 that one is written by the leading
[2:24:03.400 --> 2:24:13.720]  bio expert in the military of medical science academy in china that team work with general
[2:24:13.720 --> 2:24:21.560]  wei chen who take in take in charge of wuhan lab last february i think definitely people know them
[2:24:21.560 --> 2:24:29.000]  so this team actually focused on establishing the theory of the unrestricted our weapon
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:38.840]  strategies for ccp especially for chairman xi and in that book they claim that to divide america is
[2:24:38.840 --> 2:24:48.040]  very important because in their strategy america is a primary uh enemy for them because america
[2:24:48.040 --> 2:24:56.200]  doesn't allow the dictatorship or communism and there is a freedom in america so they
[2:24:56.200 --> 2:25:03.320]  point out that they need to understand the policies politicals and think tanks from america
[2:25:03.320 --> 2:25:11.560]  and for example they take the example that n9h especially n9aid and john hovkins they are the
[2:25:11.560 --> 2:25:20.600]  organizations in u.s to help surveillance the bioweapon related race that's why china knows if
[2:25:20.600 --> 2:25:27.240]  they can manipulate the top experts in these organizations then they can manipulate the
[2:25:27.240 --> 2:25:35.320]  information and america promising makers and now you see what happened now well and and at least
[2:25:35.320 --> 2:25:40.600]  the fbi did arrest the head of harvard science who was basically on the payroll of the chinese
[2:25:40.600 --> 2:25:45.000]  giving him a lot of this technology so clearly you've got bill gates that helped opened up china
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:50.360]  you've got fouchy that's a a communist chinese supporter they're getting all this power they're
[2:25:50.360 --> 2:25:56.360]  getting all this control and fouchy bragged in 2017 trump will be challenged by a novel virus
[2:25:56.360 --> 2:26:00.360]  and then of course we'll play it next segment dazzic bragging about how they were preparing it
[2:26:00.360 --> 2:26:04.680]  and getting it ready i think to cover his butt later when he knew it would come out
[2:26:04.680 --> 2:26:08.840]  they aren't very happy with you though are they i don't think they expected all this to come out
[2:26:08.840 --> 2:26:15.080]  they are not happy with me and the china government doesn't happy with me that's why
[2:26:15.080 --> 2:26:21.400]  they are hunting me and they're using propaganda to smear me just to describe me as some hamster
[2:26:21.400 --> 2:26:28.920]  keeper or some liar which is very hilarious but i have evidence i have shown the scientific and
[2:26:28.920 --> 2:26:37.400]  intelligence evidence here since i start to tell people that there would be a there would be pandemic
[2:26:37.400 --> 2:26:45.080]  if you don't control it in time on 19th january last year at that time i'm the only person tell it
[2:26:45.080 --> 2:26:52.040]  to the world and the china know i'm the insider because i tell the world human to human transmission
[2:26:52.040 --> 2:26:58.600]  exists and also this is not from the seafood market there is no animal intermediate host
[2:26:58.600 --> 2:27:05.000]  i told people that who is covering up with china there will be strong variant in the future if
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:13.240]  not control it and also that day 19th january last year i told people that this is a product from
[2:27:13.240 --> 2:27:19.960]  chinese military lab by gain of function engineering it's not from some bad theory in
[2:27:19.960 --> 2:27:27.880]  somewhere in china it is passed by the pl a people's liberation army and then modified
[2:27:27.880 --> 2:27:34.760]  did a lot of gain of function modification which still need our to study because we
[2:27:34.760 --> 2:27:40.920]  don't know how many functions hidden in this virus so these are all verified that's why
[2:27:40.920 --> 2:27:47.400]  they don't want to talk about it and that's why they want to censor all the people that talking
[2:27:47.400 --> 2:27:54.520]  about that well dr li mingyan is our guest again you can follow her on her real twitter
[2:27:54.520 --> 2:27:59.160]  we'll put on screen for tv viewers i'll give it to you next segment but uh while we come back let's
[2:27:59.160 --> 2:28:03.160]  look then i want you to get some time to talk about your research what's in your paper and how you
[2:28:03.160 --> 2:28:07.320]  could look at the virus and know it was man-made which is now confirmed these all these viruses
[2:28:07.320 --> 2:28:11.960]  combined how they did it uh what really want they shut the lab down for weeks we don't know
[2:28:11.960 --> 2:28:16.760]  cell phone activity right before the outbreak was announced so as best you can tell was it done on
[2:28:16.760 --> 2:28:21.880]  purpose i think you're saying it was uh versus them saying oh it happened on accident i look at the
[2:28:21.880 --> 2:28:28.120]  timing i look at the media working with uh the dictator of china i mean i see it all and it was
[2:28:28.120 --> 2:28:33.640]  clearly premeditated and they told us 15 days to flatten the curve and now here we are still under
[2:28:33.640 --> 2:28:40.680]  lockdown uh around the world it is incredible we'll be right back everybody listening on am and fm

[2:33:19.880 --> 2:33:26.200]  well authoritarian all over the world love using this virus and the fear of it the lockdown
[2:33:26.200 --> 2:33:33.160]  society and then to bring us these vaccines i'm going to ask review on those as well but the great
[2:33:33.160 --> 2:33:39.480]  part here on the alex jones show about my job is that i don't care about hollywood stars i don't
[2:33:39.480 --> 2:33:45.800]  care about sports icons i care about trailblazers and interesting people and people that tell the
[2:33:45.800 --> 2:33:51.800]  truth and and stand up and do what's right like with a member over in asia where they had the big
[2:33:51.800 --> 2:33:56.360]  cave cave in with all the school kids in it the divers would go in and save them one by one those
[2:33:56.360 --> 2:34:01.160]  are heroes those were interesting people i'd like to interview them and then you've got somebody
[2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:08.600]  like dr lee ming yang who puts out the first paper was there was an expert went and investigated it
[2:34:09.160 --> 2:34:15.400]  for a university came back documented it and has now been vindicated that that's a hero and i know
[2:34:15.400 --> 2:34:20.200]  she doesn't see herself as a hero but it's people like her that are going to turn the tide against
[2:34:20.200 --> 2:34:25.240]  this evil so we've got another 25 minutes left i love you to be able to go anywhere you want
[2:34:25.240 --> 2:34:30.520]  but it's probably important for you to go back to the time of your scent to investigate and then
[2:34:30.520 --> 2:34:35.640]  how you know this was staged how you know it was chimeric which they now admit it's like saying a
[2:34:35.640 --> 2:34:41.560]  swiss watch puts itself together in the desert from sand and the idea that from reading your paper
[2:34:41.560 --> 2:34:47.080]  that's now been proven right it's preposterous to claim five different species of animal jumped
[2:34:47.080 --> 2:34:53.080]  millions of years of quote evolution or whatever and then magically made this this chimera then
[2:34:53.080 --> 2:34:59.160]  after your report came out the indians and the australians and others scanned the virus and said
[2:34:59.160 --> 2:35:04.600]  you could see the insertion genes and how it had been made so so you're the virologist you're the
[2:35:04.600 --> 2:35:10.920]  renowned doctor that first broke this walk us through how you knew it was man-made okay i
[2:35:10.920 --> 2:35:18.200]  actually alexis is a long story let me try to briefly tell our audience that i was upon i was
[2:35:18.200 --> 2:35:27.320]  punted by my supervisor dr leo pung on behalf of who reference lab in hong kong to understand what
[2:35:27.320 --> 2:35:37.560]  happened in wuhan on 31st december 2019 so at that time china government blocked all the information
[2:35:37.560 --> 2:35:46.760]  even to the experts so my access to china cdc to the doctors and researchers in all over china
[2:35:46.760 --> 2:35:54.840]  gave me the quick intelligence collection and that tells us that china knows there is outbreak
[2:35:54.840 --> 2:36:01.800]  and china was hiding this information and then later on the response from who shows that they
[2:36:01.800 --> 2:36:08.200]  compromised with china government and hide it and checked to the audience uh checked the public
[2:36:08.200 --> 2:36:12.840]  together with chinese communist party and you were the first to say that you were the first to say
[2:36:12.840 --> 2:36:19.240]  that when it was called the wuhan um pneumonia and just to be clear it's all been proven that you're
[2:36:19.240 --> 2:36:27.320]  right the un did actively cover it up yes they actually covered up and more than covered up
[2:36:27.320 --> 2:36:33.960]  they drawn into this kind of plan although they cannot catch the real secret but they actually
[2:36:33.960 --> 2:36:41.880]  deliver the technology and also help china to escape from the punishment and also these are well
[2:36:41.880 --> 2:36:49.560]  planned by chinese communist party since 20 years ago and then what i want to tell people is my
[2:36:49.560 --> 2:36:57.800]  research from last january shows that china actually tried to uh frame some animal for example
[2:36:57.800 --> 2:37:05.320]  raccoon dog they try to frame a penguin they try to let people start this as a wild animal which
[2:37:05.320 --> 2:37:13.480]  carries this kind of virus and transmits to humans from the safe market which is totally mine you see
[2:37:13.480 --> 2:37:21.640]  until now they cannot find the animal and actually from mid january when i was in hong kong i have
[2:37:21.640 --> 2:37:30.680]  started email from some expert to my lab that you'd better focus on the raccoon dog and it implies that
[2:37:30.680 --> 2:37:37.480]  you find the raccoon dog from wuhan you will identify that as intermediate host and the other
[2:37:37.480 --> 2:37:45.720]  people will help you to make up a but at that time i reveal it through udas media in chinese on youtube
[2:37:45.720 --> 2:37:51.240]  which actually triggered the chinese communist party and the chairman she's office that's why
[2:37:51.240 --> 2:38:00.440]  they have to change their strategies and get avoid of more deaths and also more damage somehow they
[2:38:00.440 --> 2:38:04.840]  still do that well i agree with you that coming to shine that quarterback this and is the heart of
[2:38:04.840 --> 2:38:10.040]  the new world order but clearly worked with western criminals you can see the scripting but what do you
[2:38:10.040 --> 2:38:15.560]  make of obama when when the media made a big deal of this in 2015 at chapel hill north carolina
[2:38:16.120 --> 2:38:21.880]  and when fouchy had it moved to wuhan i mean clearly there's major involvement with obama
[2:38:21.880 --> 2:38:27.480]  and the globalist here as well because china oh the the communist as you know threatened back and
[2:38:27.480 --> 2:38:31.960]  said if you blame us we'll blame you so i think that's why they did a joint operation so they
[2:38:31.960 --> 2:38:39.640]  could blame each other because china had infiltrated america for many years in your military labs in
[2:38:39.640 --> 2:38:46.600]  your civil labs and especially the science and the academic research field they have their military
[2:38:46.600 --> 2:38:53.400]  civil fusion infiltration and that's why they can compromise and manipulate and the concert
[2:38:53.400 --> 2:39:01.320]  is uh um concussion some of your many of your scientists all the officers to work with them
[2:39:01.320 --> 2:39:08.760]  so you're saying many of them are in collusion yes exactly and that also has explained in the
[2:39:08.760 --> 2:39:17.160]  evidence i obtained for example they talked about that from 2005 bio weapon convention
[2:39:17.160 --> 2:39:25.240]  conference engineer told that who will be the surveillance organization for bio weapons sure
[2:39:25.240 --> 2:39:29.560]  so china working through them and with gates set up how to respond so they could release it and
[2:39:29.560 --> 2:39:34.840]  then cover it up what do you make of event 201 and all this frantic governments and john hopkins
[2:39:34.840 --> 2:39:39.720]  and the chinese government frantically drilling for this happening in the months right before it
[2:39:39.720 --> 2:39:45.560]  happened i see that is them preparing and getting ready and getting their people all trained these
[2:39:45.560 --> 2:39:52.440]  people they bring the chinese so kind of uh academic spies came here and also many innocent
[2:39:52.440 --> 2:39:59.880]  chinese people are blackmailed by our government to deliver the technology back to china and the
[2:39:59.880 --> 2:40:06.760]  american scientists like in john hopkins or in rough barracks lab or new york blood center which
[2:40:06.760 --> 2:40:13.960]  is very important because people can access american people's gene data genetic data from there are all
[2:40:13.960 --> 2:40:20.760]  helping i mean many of them are helping china government to work on these things they deliver
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:27.160]  the things back to china and then they exchange for benefits like they get promotion they are
[2:40:27.160 --> 2:40:33.400]  sent into the international organization like food and agriculture organization word animal
[2:40:34.040 --> 2:40:40.680]  organization uh who sure look at the head harvard scientist china the chinese government gave him
[2:40:40.680 --> 2:40:48.280]  millions of secret money yes yes i mean that is just piece of the iceberg there are a lot of this
[2:40:48.280 --> 2:40:56.120]  china's massive infiltration in america actually didn't trigger the alarm because china studied
[2:40:56.120 --> 2:41:03.480]  your mouth they studied your policies they know how to disguise it and get a word of this kind of
[2:41:04.040 --> 2:41:09.560]  surveillance and the confusions societies all of it are leaning on how do we counter this how do we
[2:41:09.560 --> 2:41:17.560]  respond to this tell your policy makers that is unrestricted bioweapon they need to update the
[2:41:17.560 --> 2:41:25.480]  mouth terms and also they need to understand that misinformation is another arm for this novel
[2:41:25.480 --> 2:41:34.200]  non-traditional bioweapon together this is ccp's unrestricted strategies to change america to control
[2:41:34.200 --> 2:41:41.400]  america and also controls the world you don't have much time you have to understand how evil ccp
[2:41:41.400 --> 2:41:48.840]  is and not listen to them not trust them and you have to defend to protect america and your next
[2:41:48.840 --> 2:41:57.960]  generations powerfully said please continue doctor sure i mean we can talk more in the next
[2:41:57.960 --> 2:42:03.640]  section right because i say only one minute left and i really want to tell people this is not only a
[2:42:03.640 --> 2:42:11.320]  lab accident this is because of their reckless operation their trial in the neighborhood using
[2:42:11.320 --> 2:42:19.000]  chinese people then get out of control and make the local outbreak and then they take the advantage
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:25.880]  of that outbreak to spread it all over the world because this unrestricted bioweapon is designed
[2:42:25.880 --> 2:42:31.240]  to spread the pandemic all over the world you're a hundred percent right because i can see all the
[2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:35.960]  prescripting it's like a new chevy trucks coming out or a new coca-cola it's just oh the bio attacks
[2:42:35.960 --> 2:42:39.480]  come and give your rights up when it does and all the drills and all the preparation and then
[2:42:39.480 --> 2:42:45.400]  obama working with ggping and then it all happens and then china's good and we're bad and then oh
[2:42:45.400 --> 2:42:49.880]  just 14 days and then it's forever we're going to talk about how to counter this and dr peter
[2:42:49.880 --> 2:42:54.840]  dazik and the smoking gun with our amazing guests and i'm going to host some into the next hour to
[2:42:54.840 --> 2:43:01.800]  take your calls folks stay with us the purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty
[2:43:01.800 --> 2:43:08.040]  to be afraid of today half the population has lined up for an untested deadly and debilitating
[2:43:08.040 --> 2:43:13.480]  experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease
[2:43:13.480 --> 2:43:19.000]  the perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80 of the population hooked
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:24.600]  up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years for those of us who have
[2:43:24.600 --> 2:43:30.280]  awoken from the spell we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see
[2:43:30.280 --> 2:43:35.960]  but there is only two things to do we continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game
[2:43:35.960 --> 2:43:42.040]  if enough people awaken from the cold spell then we win but even when we win and we eventually will
[2:43:42.040 --> 2:43:47.320]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare get up to a years

[2:48:02.360 --> 2:48:09.080]  telling him in december of 2019 get the vaccine ready so clearly this whole thing's been a plan
[2:48:09.080 --> 2:48:17.320]  it's sick so a doctor please continue oh yeah since you talk about the vaccine i really want to tell
[2:48:17.320 --> 2:48:24.920]  people i work in the wHO lab and i have my influenza universal vaccine patent on pending
[2:48:24.920 --> 2:48:32.840]  i'm not anti-vaccine but i'm anti-vaccine mandate and also i'm anti the unsafe and
[2:48:32.840 --> 2:48:40.680]  inefficient vaccine because this is chinese communist party's unrestricted bioweapon and
[2:48:40.680 --> 2:48:49.480]  especially in their spike protein of this virus ccp has uh designed many functions which they
[2:48:49.480 --> 2:48:56.760]  learn from like dengue seika and ebola and high-passage and even influenza all these things and
[2:48:56.760 --> 2:49:04.200]  put them in to the coronavirus it's like playing lago and then make you have more disease that's
[2:49:04.200 --> 2:49:12.760]  why we still have a lot of symptoms like a homer like the brain fog like you start to get uh like
[2:49:13.400 --> 2:49:21.160]  disorder in multiple symptoms in your body like heart, lung and the kidney reproductive systems
[2:49:21.160 --> 2:49:28.440]  all this because china purposely designed it using their expertise using their technology
[2:49:28.440 --> 2:49:33.800]  and by the way some people say it's not real but we know it's a five virus chimera and it's
[2:49:33.800 --> 2:49:38.920]  it seems to me what i've seen is since it mutated it's much worse this year because i talked to
[2:49:38.920 --> 2:49:44.440]  doctors i got my ear of the ground last year they were overblowing it at least here but but now
[2:49:44.440 --> 2:49:49.400]  they're not overblowing it this i mean i i've got i know people personally who like have basically
[2:49:49.400 --> 2:49:53.880]  Alzheimer's since they got it totally sharp three weeks ago don't know who they are now
[2:49:53.880 --> 2:49:58.760]  can't taste can't smell and are basically half dead i mean so i definitely know this is real
[2:50:00.200 --> 2:50:07.000]  yeah like the blood clot and also antibody dependent enhancement and also neurotoxicity
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:13.960]  on and also autoimmune disorder all these i think i mean well studied by those military and
[2:50:13.960 --> 2:50:20.280]  civil studies in china so how many viruses is it combined doctors is it am i correct to say five
[2:50:20.280 --> 2:50:26.200]  some say six oh i won't say like that i will tell you that china studies
[2:50:26.200 --> 2:50:35.640]  bioterrorism reagent list from america europe and also russia and they focus on studying of this
[2:50:35.640 --> 2:50:43.960]  boundary agent which can lead the bioterrorism but they won't directly use it like direct copy paste
[2:50:43.960 --> 2:50:51.160]  to the coronavirus they learn the mechanism and try to manage to make this mechanism happened
[2:50:51.160 --> 2:50:59.000]  on coronavirus some works some failed but somehow finally it's become like the frankenstein and that
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:05.320]  is what they have and they have knowledge and they start still studying for other things so you're
[2:51:05.320 --> 2:51:10.520]  saying they created a frankenstein a frankenstein monster and regardless they created and it got
[2:51:10.520 --> 2:51:14.040]  out of the lab there's now terrorizing the countryside so so let me ask you this
[2:51:15.880 --> 2:51:20.040]  obviously i know vaccines are real science they get contaminated they have side effects there's
[2:51:20.040 --> 2:51:25.880]  problems i don't even see these m r and a as a vaccine because it's it's it's it's a lie that
[2:51:25.880 --> 2:51:31.320]  it makes the body create spike protein so you are a virologist you study this what do you make of
[2:51:32.440 --> 2:51:37.320]  the reports of deaths and problems and people not being protected by this vaccine
[2:51:38.840 --> 2:51:46.040]  first i want to state that yeah we encourage the new technology but we also need data very
[2:51:46.040 --> 2:51:53.640]  strict scientific data to prove it is safe and it is efficient let me tell you coronavirus
[2:51:53.640 --> 2:52:01.320]  from start one to to now start two we don't have the real efficient vaccines for over
[2:52:01.320 --> 2:52:07.240]  almost 20 years and suddenly within several months they put it to market and then again
[2:52:07.240 --> 2:52:14.760]  they start to mandate people to use that and the very hilarious thing is the vaccine cannot stop
[2:52:14.760 --> 2:52:21.320]  transmission then why do you mandate people because as they claimed if this vaccine can really
[2:52:21.320 --> 2:52:28.680]  reduce the severity and the deaths from the COVID-19 then it is a personal choice unless it
[2:52:28.680 --> 2:52:35.000]  can prevent transmission if not there is no reason you have to force people to get it and
[2:52:35.000 --> 2:52:40.440]  amen to that doctor you're you're amazing let me play a clip from dr peter dazik in december
[2:52:40.440 --> 2:52:45.400]  of 2019 when you had been dispatched one of the first to investigate this here he is covering his
[2:52:45.400 --> 2:52:51.720]  butt doing an interview saying oh we can bind five viruses to make a vaccine admitting basically
[2:52:51.720 --> 2:52:58.840]  gain a function here it is but if you're saying these are diverse uh coronaviruses and you can't
[2:52:58.840 --> 2:53:03.480]  vaccinate against them there are no antivirals what what do we what do we do well so i i think
[2:53:03.480 --> 2:53:07.880]  that coronaviruses are pretty good i mean urologists you know all this stuff but they
[2:53:07.880 --> 2:53:13.240]  you can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily there's just spike protein drives a lot of what
[2:53:13.240 --> 2:53:18.680]  happens with the coronavirus uh zoonotic risk so you can get the sequence you can build the protein
[2:53:18.680 --> 2:53:25.160]  and we work with Ralph Barrick at UNC to do this um insert it into backbone of another virus right
[2:53:25.160 --> 2:53:30.520]  and do do some work in the lab so you can get more predictive when you find a sequence you've got
[2:53:30.520 --> 2:53:37.320]  this diversity now the the logical progression for vaccines is if you're going to develop a
[2:53:37.320 --> 2:53:43.640]  vaccine for SARS people are going to use you know pandemic SARS as yeah sure but let's try and
[2:53:43.640 --> 2:53:48.440]  insert some of these other yeah related and get a better vaccine and i guess also knowledge of what's
[2:53:48.440 --> 2:53:54.520]  there if you see something emerging give a head start on making a vaccine or a therapeutic that's
[2:53:54.520 --> 2:54:01.480]  true and and you know better knowledge of where they are as well so you can put your money into
[2:54:01.480 --> 2:54:06.360]  this clinics that matter and that's one of the big things that we've been trying to push there's a
[2:54:06.360 --> 2:54:14.600]  lot of um the word predict or the word you know the um anticipating forecasting pandemics it it
[2:54:14.600 --> 2:54:19.480]  doesn't mean you can stop them that's the problem this is so yeah so what we're trying to say
[2:54:19.480 --> 2:54:23.880]  on a global scale if we can show where the most lights come from the species the most lights
[2:54:23.880 --> 2:54:31.880]  originating the people most like to get affected a global actor like WHO or a national government
[2:54:31.880 --> 2:54:37.720]  can better allocate resources to the highest risk okay so he just admitted doctor that they are merging
[2:54:38.440 --> 2:54:42.280]  the viruses together exactly what they did have another club of him admitting Chinese
[2:54:42.280 --> 2:54:47.320]  colleagues develop killer coronaviruses at Wuhan what do you make of those admissions
[2:54:47.320 --> 2:54:53.880]  and then his boss Fauci tells congress no such thing was done uh Peter Daschak is more about
[2:54:53.880 --> 2:55:02.120]  politician and his dishonest politician the scientist and this virus is not only designed in Wuhan it is
[2:55:02.120 --> 2:55:10.360]  released in Wuhan but it is designed and worked within the military lab network from Beijing to
[2:55:10.360 --> 2:55:18.040]  Hong Kong to Wuhan to hobby all over China I mean if only focused on Wuhan that is definitely
[2:55:18.040 --> 2:55:24.920]  cannot solve any problem of their bioweapon unrestricted bioweapon program and also
[2:55:24.920 --> 2:55:31.720]  Daschak already admits that it's easy to manipulate the spike proteins and because
[2:55:31.720 --> 2:55:39.880]  he's not a good scientist so his description is very simple but China has made it more comprehensive
[2:55:39.880 --> 2:55:48.200]  because the unrestricted unrestricted bioweapon according to CCP's definition has to look like
[2:55:48.200 --> 2:55:55.480]  from nature and that's why they can't tell people oh it's from nature it's mysterious and we have to
[2:55:55.480 --> 2:56:03.320]  get money from America get help to look for like another 10 years to find the why it happened and
[2:56:03.320 --> 2:56:09.800]  then people will forget the origin is CCP is exactly in the CCP in their global
[2:56:09.800 --> 2:56:13.880]  list allies are getting total power and control making hundreds of billions off the vaccines in
[2:56:13.880 --> 2:56:18.280]  response to it they need to be held accountable or their whole agenda will keep rolling forward
[2:56:18.280 --> 2:56:23.160]  that's why your work and senator ran paul's work and others is so central and the whole world
[2:56:23.160 --> 2:56:28.680]  is counting on what you and and senator paul and others are doing I mean we were hit with a bioweapon
[2:56:28.680 --> 2:56:33.320]  china is now superior taking over the world economy we're still partially shut down they've
[2:56:33.320 --> 2:56:37.960]  given us leaky bad vaccines we are literally uh under attack and do you agree that we should
[2:56:37.960 --> 2:56:44.360]  see fauci criminally investigated and bill gates and others because we can't get ggping right now but
[2:56:44.360 --> 2:56:51.240]  couldn't we start with their with his minions here in america yeah of course because these people are
[2:56:51.240 --> 2:56:57.720]  in america they are american citizens so you're most i mean applied to them and they have to listen
[2:56:57.720 --> 2:57:04.360]  to that but china they can try to get rid of that that's why the promising makers the magic
[2:57:04.360 --> 2:57:12.520]  leaders need to understand china's unrestricted evil tactics and fix this problem and the cgp is
[2:57:12.520 --> 2:57:20.120]  the one dominant it by himself and all chinese communist party need to be held held accountable
[2:57:20.120 --> 2:57:25.080]  all right everybody should follow you on twitter dr lee mignon we really appreciate you please come

[2:59:49.000 --> 2:59:56.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:00:05.000 --> 3:00:06.000]  Welcome back.
[3:00:06.000 --> 3:00:07.000]  Hour number four.
[3:00:07.000 --> 3:00:09.000]  Jill Slutney taking over in 15 minutes.
[3:00:09.000 --> 3:00:11.500]  I want to get to all the great callers that are holding.
[3:00:11.500 --> 3:00:13.000]  Joe and London's been holding.
[3:00:13.000 --> 3:00:15.000]  I want to talk about the madness in Europe.
[3:00:15.000 --> 3:00:16.000]  Yeah.
[3:00:16.000 --> 3:00:19.000]  It looks like footage I've seen out of Tiananmen Square.
[3:00:19.000 --> 3:00:23.000]  Cops beating men, women, and children running over them with horses.
[3:00:23.000 --> 3:00:27.000]  Neon men held down by police in the face, knocking their teeth out.
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:31.000]  All because they try to go out on the street and say that they're essential.
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:33.000]  Yep, it's the globalist power grab.
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:38.000]  Joe, you guys are fighting back harder than we are here in America, though, over in London.
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:40.000]  I've seen millions march and we salute you.
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:42.000]  Tell us what's happening.
[3:00:42.000 --> 3:00:43.000]  Hey, big fella.
[3:00:43.000 --> 3:00:44.000]  How are you?
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  I'm all right, brother.
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:50.000]  A weary, weary heart that I'm making the effort to call you on this day.
[3:00:50.000 --> 3:00:52.000]  Fantastic guest, by the way.
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:56.000]  You just had a brilliant piece of information.
[3:00:56.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  I know you can't say half the stuff you'd love to say.
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:04.000]  So with your permission, perhaps I'll be able to say a few things and not get anyone into trouble.
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:09.000]  So this is a message primarily to the American audience that you have.
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  Everything that this guy folks has been saying is legit.
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:21.000]  I'm in London, the United Kingdom, although we do have a resistance, is gone.
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:23.000]  It is gone.
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:26.000]  Europe, gone.
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:29.000]  Australia, gone.
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:32.000]  The Middle East, gone.
[3:01:32.000 --> 3:01:37.000]  Canada, oh my goodness me, gone.
[3:01:37.000 --> 3:01:47.000]  Your place, your place is the only place that still has constitution.
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:54.000]  I'd like to ask every single American listening to this right now, and it's not even a rhetorical.
[3:01:54.000 --> 3:02:01.000]  Is your second amendment there just to take up some space on a parchment?
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:06.000]  Because it certainly feels like it from over here, because we don't have that.
[3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:09.000]  We don't have that.
[3:02:09.000 --> 3:02:12.000]  You guys need to wake up.
[3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:22.000]  You see Mr. Jones lose his shit time and time again because he is just frustrated, so frustrated.
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:32.000]  Every day, probably every night, he's got to go through all of the research he goes through and his team
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:40.000]  to bring absolutely critical information to the forefront, because they're banned from everywhere.
[3:02:40.000 --> 3:02:42.000]  What are you doing guys?
[3:02:42.000 --> 3:02:47.000]  Because this tsunami is heading to you.
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  If it's not already there, it's knocking on your door.
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:57.000]  And you, unfortunately, the view from over here, you guys, you're not listening.
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  You need to get up, wake up. What are you? Seriously, seriously, are you sick?
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:08.000]  Well, let me say it this way.
[3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:12.000]  They're going to start a war with us because they want a physical one to crack down like they've done in Europe.
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:16.000]  But you're right, Americans aren't protesting one-one-hundreds like they should,
[3:03:16.000 --> 3:03:22.000]  and people better get politically aggressive in a civil disobedience way before things get so bad
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:24.000]  that it does become a second amendment issue.
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:27.000]  But I will say this to Europe, and I don't want this to happen at this point,
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  but you guys have gasoline and you guys have a lot of clubs.
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:33.000]  You get any guns you want with a club.
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:35.000]  I don't want to go to that point. I'm not calling for it.
[3:03:35.000 --> 3:03:37.000]  But they are assaulting you with deadly shots.
[3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:43.000]  They are beating you up. They are locking you up because the globalists were losing politically, so this is their revenge.
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:49.000]  So my question to you is, what do you think we can all do short of violence to turn this back?
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:54.000]  See the police running over women with horses, pepper spraying babies, beating up men,
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:04:01.000]  and yeah, it makes my blood boil. They are assaulting us, so it is in the threat continuum right for us to fight back.
[3:04:01.000 --> 3:04:05.000]  I'm just saying they've got a trap set up once that happens, and I don't think that's the way to go.
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:09.000]  That's what they're telling cops, run people over with cars, kick their heads in,
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:11.000]  because they know they've politically lost the people.
[3:04:11.000 --> 3:04:14.000]  Take Australia. Only twenty-five percent have taken the shots, brother.
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:18.000]  So again, yeah, they're under martial law because they're not doing what they're supposed to. Does that make sense?
[3:04:18.000 --> 3:04:23.000]  I totally agree with you. And just to reiterate, I'm not calling for violence.
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:30.000]  You have your second amendment. Yeah, it talks about guns, obviously, but you know one thing that you need to use them.
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:36.000]  You look at civil disobedience, which you have called for time and time again. Be peaceful.
[3:04:36.000 --> 3:04:40.000]  I agree. We need to go to Mitt Romney's house. We need to go to Fauci's house.
[3:04:40.000 --> 3:04:45.000]  We need to say you're the ones that are contaminating us by being injected. You're the tyrants.
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:49.000]  I mean, these people are out of control, and they need legal, lawful pushback. Thanks for the call, Joe.
[3:04:49.000 --> 3:04:54.000]  All right. Let me come back. Samantha and others. I'm going right to you.
[3:04:54.000 --> 3:05:16.000]  Samantha, Lisa, Scott, Paul, Steve. We'll be right back in 60.

[3:06:02.000 --> 3:06:10.000]  And we are back live. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us here on another live edition of the Alex Jones show.
[3:06:10.000 --> 3:06:20.000]  And we are taking your phone calls right now ahead of Gerald Salente, the great trans forecaster who is about to take over in the next 45 minutes of transmission.
[3:06:20.000 --> 3:06:25.000]  Let's go to Samantha in Mississippi. Samantha, you're on the air. Welcome.
[3:06:25.000 --> 3:06:30.000]  Hi, Alex. I just wanted to give you a sliver of hope.
[3:06:30.000 --> 3:06:40.000]  My son and his father landed in the hospital, both with what they labeled as COVID pneumonia. They are not vaccinated.
[3:06:40.000 --> 3:06:49.000]  But they were giving them vitamin C, B3 zinc, they were giving them aspirin, robocustin.
[3:06:49.000 --> 3:06:55.000]  They were taking ivermectin and azithromycin a week prior because they were both sick at home.
[3:06:55.000 --> 3:07:01.000]  And the doctor, of course, had to send them home. But when they landed in the hospital, they tested them for COVID.
[3:07:01.000 --> 3:07:07.000]  They did the PCR test and they also did a blood test to confirm.
[3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:09.000]  So there are good things happening.
[3:07:09.000 --> 3:07:17.000]  Yes, there are hospitals that know the truth and are having basically 100% success rates within the cocktail that you just mentioned if they catch it early.
[3:07:17.000 --> 3:07:28.000]  Yes, and they were treating them themselves earlier with the azithromycin and ivermectin at home before they landed in the hospital about a week.
[3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:33.000]  My son's father comes into his home in purple with blue lips.
[3:07:33.000 --> 3:07:37.000]  And so they called the ambulance to pick both of them up and take them both to the hospital.
[3:07:37.000 --> 3:07:42.000]  Oh, absolutely. And the media is going, oh, look, everybody's sick now. The Patriot idiots were wrong.
[3:07:42.000 --> 3:07:47.000]  We said last year, statistically, there was the same number of deaths that was overblown.
[3:07:47.000 --> 3:07:52.000]  I was saying three months ago, folks, I'm seeing illness. I'm talking to doctors. This is serious.
[3:07:52.000 --> 3:07:56.000]  And all the evidence we're getting is it's the mutated version from the inoculated.
[3:07:56.000 --> 3:08:02.000]  We have Pfizer documents. I didn't get to them today, but I'm going to shoot a special report on that today or I'll go on the warren with Owen.
[3:08:02.000 --> 3:08:06.000]  But it's incredible. But I'm glad to hear that they pulled through.
[3:08:06.000 --> 3:08:13.000]  Yes, my son got out of the hospital Monday. His father has already been in for two and a half weeks.
[3:08:13.000 --> 3:08:16.000]  My son was in for about six or seven days.
[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:22.000]  But his father, he suffered a collapsed lung while he was in there.
[3:08:22.000 --> 3:08:26.000]  Thank God they got to it and they drained it and he's getting better.
[3:08:26.000 --> 3:08:33.000]  It's just going to take him a little more time. They both have asthma, like I said, but they were treating it at home early.
[3:08:33.000 --> 3:08:38.000]  And they still had a long stay in the hospital that they are recovering.
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:44.000]  And I think they're going to pull out of this. My son was back to himself days after being out of the hospital.
[3:08:44.000 --> 3:08:46.000]  It was wonderful.
[3:08:46.000 --> 3:08:49.000]  That's good news, Samantha. Thanks for calling. Please spread the word about the show.
[3:08:49.000 --> 3:08:52.000]  It's how we're going to reach new people. Thank you so much.
[3:08:52.000 --> 3:08:57.000]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Lisa in Maine. Lisa, thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[3:08:57.000 --> 3:09:05.000]  Hi, Alex. I'm so glad I was turned on to your site several years ago by a dear, dear friend.
[3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:13.000]  And the stuff that you put out is just amazing and I can't believe more people aren't listening.
[3:09:13.000 --> 3:09:18.000]  The reason I called is I live right across the street from a church.
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  And the services have been very low for a long time, mostly very old people.
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:27.000]  And there is a child care center there with the playground.
[3:09:27.000 --> 3:09:35.000]  And the child care taker received her vaccine probably about three to four months ago.
[3:09:35.000 --> 3:09:42.000]  And then she started getting blood clots and had to go into the hospital to have a hysterectomy.
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:43.000]  Oh, yeah.
[3:09:43.000 --> 3:09:46.000]  Now she's back out and she's taking care of the children.
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:55.000]  And these babies are like from three to eight. And I'm wondering, isn't she possibly causing them some harm?
[3:09:55.000 --> 3:10:00.000]  Yes, ma'am. I've gotten my stack. I covered it yesterday on the Sunday show, but I'm going to do an hour on it.
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:04.000]  I meant to today, but I just got behind because the calls are so interesting on the guest.
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:08.000]  But we weren't sure we're going to get that lady today and then she was able to come on today.
[3:10:08.000 --> 3:10:15.000]  I was in cover in the third hour. I have Pfizer's own study on their vaccine admitting it's not a vaccine and that it makes you release spike proteins.
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  So absolutely, it is the vaccinated that are infecting everyone and that's where all the sickness is coming from.
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:23.000]  We have the studies.
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:29.000]  And so how do I fix this problem or do I just leave it alone?
[3:10:29.000 --> 3:10:31.000]  You know, it's so bad now with half the public took it.
[3:10:31.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  I mean, it's just unless you live out on a farm and stay away from folks, you're going to get these spike proteins and children are stronger.
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:40.000]  But my God, it's hurting them bad.
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:46.000]  And look, the long term effects, we know it killed rats and mice in two to six months, 80 some percent of them.
[3:10:46.000 --> 3:10:50.000]  Some were just able to live with it, but it made them go blind, everything else.
[3:10:50.000 --> 3:10:53.000]  And they would then infect the other rats with spike proteins.
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:58.000]  Yeah, there's a study on screen on Pfizer and it's a shedding.
[3:10:58.000 --> 3:11:03.000]  So we were in the middle of a biological attack and that poor lady, you know, they told her go do it.
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:13.000]  And of course, it's been it's got the same protein in the in the lining of the uterus, the endometriosis or the endometri.
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:15.000]  And it causes endometriosis.
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:21.000]  Once you take the shot, it's just it's it's it isn't incredible that you can just see it happen to the lady across the street.
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:25.000]  And you and it's just it's still they just move forward with this attack.
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:26.000]  Unbelievable.
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:34.000]  And I also have a question on how long do the prions last on surfaces like shopping carts and door handles?
[3:11:34.000 --> 3:11:37.000]  We don't we don't know, but it's highly contagious.
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:39.000]  It's highly contagious.
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:43.000]  It's it's they say the delta variant, which is really the prions growing.
[3:11:43.000 --> 3:11:44.000]  That's what it is.
[3:11:44.000 --> 3:11:47.000]  It's a spike protein is a thousand times more viral.
[3:11:47.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  And I believe it.
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:50.000]  I mean, you could it's just incredible.
[3:11:50.000 --> 3:11:51.000]  God bless you, ma'am.
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:52.000]  Thank you for listening.
[3:11:52.000 --> 3:11:53.000]  Please spread the word.
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:11:55.000]  And that's how we're going to reach new people.
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:11:56.000]  You guys are awesome.
[3:11:56.000 --> 3:11:59.000]  Let's go ahead and go to the person holding the next longest.
[3:11:59.000 --> 3:12:01.000]  Let's go to Paul in New Jersey.
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:03.000]  Thanks for calling Paul.
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:04.000]  Hello, Alex.
[3:12:04.000 --> 3:12:09.000]  Alex, a few years ago, I read Ray Kurzweil's book, The Singularity is Near.
[3:12:09.000 --> 3:12:19.000]  And in that book, Kurzweil talks about how in 2045, the life extension technology should be coming into existence.
[3:12:19.000 --> 3:12:33.000]  And Alex, I think that with all the, you know, random vaccinations and the mix of the vaccination shots, I think the elite are doing life extension research through the vaccinations.
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:35.000]  Don't think, sir. Absolutely.
[3:12:35.000 --> 3:12:39.000]  We're all being tested on for them with all this nanotech.
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:40.000]  Yes, bingo.
[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:53.000]  You guys are getting older and they're very, very rich men. And the one thing they don't want to do is die if their research can come up with life extension technologies to extend their lives.
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:12:56.000]  And so I could see this as a big rush.
[3:12:56.000 --> 3:12:59.000]  And that's why I think they put the tracker chips in there.
[3:12:59.000 --> 3:13:02.000]  I think that's why some of the shots have the graphene.
[3:13:02.000 --> 3:13:03.000]  Some don't.
[3:13:03.000 --> 3:13:09.000]  I think this is a way to experiment on the cheap and not pay people the full research.
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:11.000]  Oh, yeah, just force their genetic revolution on us.
[3:13:11.000 --> 3:13:14.000]  Oh, they admit that, sir. You're dead on.
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:27.000]  It is behind a lot of this. I have a feeling is some and that's why the tracking chip, I think, to track certain individuals who get certain shots that may specialize in only one aspect of the research for life extension.
[3:13:27.000 --> 3:13:33.000]  It might focus on one organ and might focus on brain rejuvenation, whatever the shot is that they need to do.
[3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:40.000]  And much like with the, as you said, Alex, about the Manhattan Project, everything is compartmentalized and separated.
[3:13:40.000 --> 3:13:49.000]  So this way they're going to get a feedback on all these experimental vaccines under the cover of the COVID virus.
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:57.000]  And this should bring decades of life extension technology and get a lot of that done if they have to do it the slow way with volunteers.
[3:13:57.000 --> 3:14:00.000]  In this way, they can get it done quickly without volunteers.
[3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:04.000]  And the populace at the same time. The problem is that people can live to 500.
[3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:07.000]  There's going to be too many people. Perfect points. God bless you, Paul.
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:11.000]  All right, Steve and Tim and others and Scott, I'm going to call you back at 11 30 tomorrow.
[3:14:11.000 --> 3:14:13.000]  You'll be guest on the show. You'll get more time.
[3:14:13.000 --> 3:14:15.000]  I'm out of time. So it's got to take over.
[3:14:15.000 --> 3:14:17.000]  I did not get to a lot of the research and news.
[3:14:17.000 --> 3:14:23.000]  I mean, I'm going to shoot a special report or something or I'll start the show with this tomorrow because this is big stuff.
[3:14:23.000 --> 3:14:25.000]  I didn't get to. I didn't get to a lot of it.
[3:14:25.000 --> 3:14:28.000]  Please keep us on the air.
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:31.000]  I'll just be I'll just share with you what's going on.
[3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:34.000]  I've got four products that have been developed the last year or longer.
[3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:35.000]  They're ready to be produced.
[3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:40.000]  I have been waiting six months to have the money to buy the products to have produced here in America.
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:42.000]  They're all supplements. They're incredible.
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:51.000]  So please buy products and inform store.com because I think these new products are going to be such hits that it could really fix a lot of our issues and funding wise.
[3:14:51.000 --> 3:14:52.000]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:57.000]  I got a lot of plans because I'm going to have clones of these products that don't even have my name on it that are going to be advertising.
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:14:59.000]  Sold online to get around the platforming.
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:03.000]  And so we put a lot of money into the infrastructure and a lot of stuff going on.
[3:15:03.000 --> 3:15:04.000]  And I'm not complaining.
[3:15:04.000 --> 3:15:05.000]  You guys are awesome.
[3:15:05.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  I need your help.
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:08.000]  You want to see these products brought to market.
[3:15:08.000 --> 3:15:09.000]  Buy an extra t-shirt.
[3:15:09.000 --> 3:15:10.000]  Buy an extra book.

[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:44.000]  With all these attacks going on, it's really important to boost however you can what's going on.
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:45.000]  Myself included.
[3:15:45.000 --> 3:15:52.000]  I remember to really take all my supplements because it's what God gave us to mitigate all the things that are going on.
[3:15:52.000 --> 3:15:54.000]  M4warstore.com.
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:15:55.000]  Thank you all.
[3:15:55.000 --> 3:15:56.000]  Great job crew.
[3:15:56.000 --> 3:15:57.000]  Amazing last hour interview.
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:16:26.000]  Thanks over now.
[3:16:28.000 --> 3:16:29.000]  Hey everybody.
[3:16:29.000 --> 3:16:32.000]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[3:16:32.000 --> 3:16:33.000]  Me too.
[3:16:33.000 --> 3:16:40.000]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[3:16:40.000 --> 3:16:44.000]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:46.000]  You probably already believe that.
[3:16:46.000 --> 3:16:47.000]  I certainly do.
[3:16:47.000 --> 3:16:48.000]  So here's the thing.
[3:16:48.000 --> 3:16:56.000]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:17:01.000]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[3:17:01.000 --> 3:17:03.000]  No cures or treatments there.

[3:17:29.000 --> 3:17:33.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:17:33.000 --> 3:17:34.000]  I sued the IRS in one.

[3:19:58.000 --> 3:20:22.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:22.000 --> 3:20:28.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:20:28.000 --> 3:20:36.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Salente.
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:38.000]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:38.000 --> 3:20:43.000]  You know, Alex said, you know, you've got to support him and support InfoWars.
[3:20:43.000 --> 3:20:45.000]  And this is out of line.
[3:20:45.000 --> 3:20:51.000]  You know, I'm listening to the people calling up and saying, you know, what happened to this person and that person.
[3:20:51.000 --> 3:20:53.000]  I mean, we all know the facts already.
[3:20:53.000 --> 3:20:56.000]  I mean, how much more of this do we have to keep hearing?
[3:20:56.000 --> 3:20:58.000]  This thing is killing people.
[3:20:58.000 --> 3:21:09.000]  The implications, the long-term and short-term implications of these gene therapy shots, you know, they're unknown.
[3:21:09.000 --> 3:21:11.000]  These are drug dealers.
[3:21:11.000 --> 3:21:14.000]  Morons and imbeciles call them big pharma.
[3:21:14.000 --> 3:21:16.000]  They're drug dealers.
[3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:19.000]  And they're destroying life.
[3:21:19.000 --> 3:21:21.000]  And our lives have been destroyed.
[3:21:21.000 --> 3:21:28.000]  They suck the spirit out of it to think that we're even talking about this.
[3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:33.000]  2020, the virus broke out.
[3:21:33.000 --> 3:21:35.000]  You know where it broke out.
[3:21:35.000 --> 3:21:46.000]  And you on China, on Chinese Lunar New Year, they couldn't stop the protests and rallies that were going on in Hong Kong.
[3:21:46.000 --> 3:21:52.000]  I was on Hong Kong TV many times during the protests.
[3:21:52.000 --> 3:21:55.000]  And I'd be talking to the reporters, you know.
[3:21:55.000 --> 3:22:11.000]  There I am in a rally over there up in Columbus Circle on Saturday in New York City.
[3:22:11.000 --> 3:22:18.000]  And it was a People's Choice rally, about 2,000 to 3,000 people showed up.
[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:22.000]  This is New York City with a population of what?
[3:22:22.000 --> 3:22:24.000]  Over 8 million.
[3:22:24.000 --> 3:22:27.000]  And that's all that turned up.
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:29.000]  It was a great crowd.
[3:22:29.000 --> 3:22:31.000]  You know, wonderful people.
[3:22:31.000 --> 3:22:33.000]  The cops were hands-off.
[3:22:33.000 --> 3:22:35.000]  They didn't bother anybody.
[3:22:35.000 --> 3:22:42.000]  And then from there, we marched down to Bryant Park.
[3:22:42.000 --> 3:22:48.000]  And, you know, going down the main avenues and they blocked everything off.
[3:22:48.000 --> 3:22:50.000]  And they were cool about it.
[3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:52.000]  You know, what he was bothering anybody.
[3:22:52.000 --> 3:22:56.000]  A couple of little imbeciles on the side over there, you know.
[3:22:56.000 --> 3:23:06.000]  They'll give you the finger and tell you to get the vax to which I clearly gave it back to them and told them to shove it up, you know what.
[3:23:06.000 --> 3:23:10.000]  And I called out to Blasio, Warren Wilhelm Jr.
[3:23:10.000 --> 3:23:12.000]  I said, this is a rally.
[3:23:12.000 --> 3:23:18.000]  This is a protest about New York.
[3:23:18.000 --> 3:23:24.000]  It breaks my heart to see what's happened.
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:27.000]  It's not the New York that I grew up in.
[3:23:27.000 --> 3:23:29.000]  I was born in the Bronx.
[3:23:29.000 --> 3:23:34.000]  You know, Napolitano born in the Bronx, born to be free.
[3:23:34.000 --> 3:23:40.000]  And now you're not allowed to believe anything that I don't tell you to believe.
[3:23:40.000 --> 3:23:42.000]  I got some little piece of crap.
[3:23:42.000 --> 3:23:48.000]  So I use proper Bronx language to call out Warren Wilhelm Jr.
[3:23:48.000 --> 3:23:54.000]  Which gave the name to Blasio, his mother's maiden name, so get the Italian-American votes in New York.
[3:23:54.000 --> 3:23:56.000]  This isn't my New York.
[3:23:56.000 --> 3:24:03.000]  These are a bunch of little freaks with gutless little clowns that are living there now.
[3:24:03.000 --> 3:24:09.000]  You know, these people were great to put on that rally and, you know, Mark Crispin Miller was a speaker.
[3:24:09.000 --> 3:24:11.000]  They were great talks.
[3:24:11.000 --> 3:24:14.000]  Look at this little jerk.
[3:24:14.000 --> 3:24:19.000]  Yeah, he was born in New York, his family moved him right up to Cambridge, Massachusetts.
[3:24:19.000 --> 3:24:24.000]  And this little freak, a little piece of scum.
[3:24:24.000 --> 3:24:29.000]  And I had everybody chanting, shove your mandate up your, you know what,
[3:24:29.000 --> 3:24:35.000]  three words that begin, three letters that begin with an A and end with an S.
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:40.000]  Shove your mandate up your, yeah.
[3:24:40.000 --> 3:24:42.000]  This isn't my New York.
[3:24:42.000 --> 3:24:53.000]  How dare this little Hitler give us a mandate as they're doing in city after city.
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:56.000]  It's one after another.
[3:24:56.000 --> 3:25:03.000]  And I pulled out some back articles from the Trends Journal, our weekly magazine.
[3:25:03.000 --> 3:25:09.000]  Last week was what, 162 pages, no ads.
[3:25:09.000 --> 3:25:12.000]  Print out.
[3:25:12.000 --> 3:25:14.000]  We're already there.
[3:25:14.000 --> 3:25:21.000]  Americans get cold feet over COVID-19 vaccination.
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:27.000]  This was September 29, 2020.
[3:25:27.000 --> 3:25:38.000]  The polls showed only 13% of Americans would be willing to take a vaccine upon rollout.
[3:25:38.000 --> 3:25:41.000]  Look how they changed the people.
[3:25:41.000 --> 3:25:49.000]  Krispy Kreme spending hundreds of millions of hour dollars promoting the vaccination.
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:53.000]  That's making the drug dealers richer.
[3:25:53.000 --> 3:26:01.000]  Yep.
[3:26:01.000 --> 3:26:11.000]  And then they told us you'd have a herd immunity at 70%.
[3:26:11.000 --> 3:26:19.000]  The lying little piece of crap, a little piece of scum, fraud, Fauci.
[3:26:19.000 --> 3:26:21.000]  That's what he said.
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:24.000]  Now they're saying herd immunity is almost impossible.
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:27.000]  And you know, again, I don't want to keep talking about the facts.
[3:26:27.000 --> 3:26:31.000]  It's a high inefficacy rate according to the Health Ministry of Israel.
[3:26:31.000 --> 3:26:40.000]  Most of the people that are going back into the hospital at 50 years old in Israel have been vaccinated at least once.
[3:26:40.000 --> 3:26:43.000]  They don't know what this thing is going to do.
[3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:45.000]  But that we're even fighting it.
[3:26:45.000 --> 3:26:48.000]  So going back to what I was saying before.
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:49.000]  There we go.
[3:26:49.000 --> 3:26:52.000]  Not making a stuff up.
[3:26:52.000 --> 3:26:57.000]  It began in Chinese Lunar New Year, they couldn't stop the Hong Kong protests.
[3:26:57.000 --> 3:27:05.000]  They stopped them immediately when the COVID virus broke out.
[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:10.000]  They locked down Hong Kong and that was the end.
[3:27:10.000 --> 3:27:15.000]  And you know what 2020 was?
[3:27:15.000 --> 3:27:20.000]  It began on Chinese Lunar New Year, the year of the rat.
[3:27:20.000 --> 3:27:22.000]  That's right.
[3:27:22.000 --> 3:27:27.000]  And we got a bunch of rats running and ruining our lives.
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:29.000]  Look at the people.
[3:27:29.000 --> 3:27:39.000]  How can we look up to these little low life clowns, gutless little creatures?
[3:27:39.000 --> 3:27:42.000]  Why are the people doing?
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:46.000]  When we come back, I want to talk about what we have to do.
[3:27:46.000 --> 3:27:50.000]  United we stand divided we fall.
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:55.000]  If we don't unite, we're finished.
[3:27:55.000 --> 3:28:09.000]  Again, 3,000 people on a perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect Saturday afternoon in New York City turned out for that protest rally.
[3:28:09.000 --> 3:28:16.000]  It should have been a half million.
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:18.000]  There we are marching down.
[3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:23.000]  Stop telling me my heart is truly broken.
[3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:24.000]  I'm a visionary.
[3:28:24.000 --> 3:28:27.000]  I see the future.
[3:28:27.000 --> 3:28:31.000]  This is in my country and there's no place in the world that ends.
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:36.000]  If we don't take it back, we lose it.
[3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:44.000]  The COVID war, dumb enough to believe Bush's wars, dumb enough to believe the COVID war.
[3:28:44.000 --> 3:28:46.000]  And that's what's happening.
[3:28:46.000 --> 3:28:49.000]  So support InfoWars.
[3:28:49.000 --> 3:28:53.000]  We're going to be right back and we're going to talk about where the economy is going as well.

[3:29:34.000 --> 3:29:36.000]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:38.000]  That's why America's got to be taken down.
[3:29:38.000 --> 3:29:42.000]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America's still quasi-free.
[3:29:42.000 --> 3:29:47.000]  You can't have InfoWars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.

[3:33:37.000 --> 3:33:41.000]  We got the little freaky geeks.
[3:33:41.000 --> 3:33:48.000]  Look at these little meek little geeks that control the Internet.
[3:33:48.000 --> 3:33:56.000]  You can't make this crap up. They're little nothing, little nothing.
[3:33:56.000 --> 3:34:04.000]  Look at the bangsters. Arrogant little nothing.
[3:34:04.000 --> 3:34:08.000]  One low life after another.
[3:34:08.000 --> 3:34:17.000]  Look at the heads of big pharma, big freaks.
[3:34:17.000 --> 3:34:24.000]  Now, we the people of the United States are being dictated by these.
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:30.000]  Them and the little clowns that they pay off to do their dirty work or politicians
[3:34:30.000 --> 3:34:39.000]  is a disgrace to our founding fathers and disgrace to my father and ancestors
[3:34:39.000 --> 3:34:44.000]  who came to America to land of opportunity.
[3:34:44.000 --> 3:34:50.000]  And now it's gone. It's gone. The big control everything.
[3:34:50.000 --> 3:34:58.000]  And in New York, as I said, it breaks my heart to see what happened to that place.
[3:34:58.000 --> 3:35:03.000]  They're not liberals. And people keep misusing that word.
[3:35:03.000 --> 3:35:09.000]  A liberal is willing to respect or accept behavior or opinions
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:15.000]  different from one's own, open to new ideas.
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:21.000]  These are libtards. They're arrogant little freaks. Again, no fighting them.
[3:35:21.000 --> 3:35:25.000]  Nothing.
[3:35:25.000 --> 3:35:33.000]  Woke, dead. Dead woke. That's who they are.
[3:35:33.000 --> 3:35:39.000]  They were all over the place out there. And again, they didn't bother anybody in the city.
[3:35:39.000 --> 3:35:44.000]  I said, I gave may get locked up for reading this.
[3:35:44.000 --> 3:35:48.000]  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
[3:35:48.000 --> 3:35:51.000]  That all men are created equal.
[3:35:51.000 --> 3:35:57.000]  That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights.
[3:35:57.000 --> 3:36:05.000]  That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:10.000]  The Declaration of Independence, pursuit of happiness.
[3:36:10.000 --> 3:36:16.000]  You never hear the word happiness from any of these little slimy freaks.
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:23.000]  These fascist little commie dictator pieces of scum.
[3:36:23.000 --> 3:36:32.000]  Happiness, you will have no happiness. You will stay in your house on the little piece of scum.
[3:36:32.000 --> 3:36:41.000]  Governor, mayor of your city, state and country around the world telling you what to do.
[3:36:41.000 --> 3:36:45.000]  You will have no happiness.
[3:36:45.000 --> 3:36:50.000]  No one ever talks about the pursuit of happiness.
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:59.000]  It's God. It's God.
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:02.000]  Look at this. Look at this guy.
[3:37:02.000 --> 3:37:06.000]  You think this guy could fight man to man?
[3:37:06.000 --> 3:37:09.000]  He wouldn't know what to do.
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:14.000]  He'd cry. He'd call the cops to help him.
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:21.000]  You want to give me that mandate? I'll take that mandate and tell you where to shove it.
[3:37:21.000 --> 3:37:29.000]  Your little sloppy lowlife boy.
[3:37:29.000 --> 3:37:38.000]  Look at him. Warren Wilhelm Jr. The Nazis would have loved you.
[3:37:38.000 --> 3:37:46.000]  That's who you are. You are a Wilhelm Nazi.
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:38:06.000]  Like those other people over there in New York that buy and swallow your crap one after another.
[3:38:06.000 --> 3:38:16.000]  That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men,
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:22.000]  deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[3:38:22.000 --> 3:38:27.000]  You got that fat boy? You got that blubber face?
[3:38:27.000 --> 3:38:35.000]  The consent of the governed. The consent of the governed.
[3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:45.000]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends,
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:54.000]  it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it.
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:38:57.000]  And that's what we have to do.
[3:38:57.000 --> 3:39:06.000]  We have to live to the new Declaration of Independence, which is the old Declaration of Independence, and abolish this.
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:10.000]  Abolish the mandates that are being forced upon us.
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:21.000]  Abolish what they're telling us to do that they have no right to do.
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:25.000]  This is not America.
[3:39:25.000 --> 3:39:30.000]  This is tyrannical government. It is dictatorships.
[3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:36.000]  Little lowlife pieces of crap telling us what to do.
[3:39:36.000 --> 3:39:44.000]  From the toilet paper record, Delta Cripples fall recovery for New York.
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:51.000]  The New York City and its trillion-dollar economy, September, was supposed to mark a return to normal.
[3:39:51.000 --> 3:39:56.000]  A moment when Broadway theaters reopened, stores and restaurants hummed,
[3:39:56.000 --> 3:40:00.000]  and tourists and office workers again filled the streets.
[3:40:00.000 --> 3:40:10.000]  But that long-awaited milestone has been upended by the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
[3:40:10.000 --> 3:40:16.000]  One big company after another has postponed plans to come back to Manhattan's soaring towers.
[3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:27.000]  Trade shows have been canceled. Small businesses have had orders evaporate.
[3:40:27.000 --> 3:40:32.000]  This is a total lie.
[3:40:32.000 --> 3:40:36.000]  It's not the Delta variant that crippled the fall recovery.
[3:40:36.000 --> 3:40:41.000]  It's a little lowlife pieces scum that should be brought to trial.
[3:40:41.000 --> 3:40:45.000]  Warren Wilhelm, Jr.
[3:40:45.000 --> 3:40:56.000]  The governors of New York, the governors of Michigan, the governors of California.
[3:40:56.000 --> 3:41:02.000]  One after another.
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:09.000]  It's not the Delta variant and the lowlife media that's selling it.
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:16.000]  And by the way, ABC News was there.
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:27.000]  NBC, the interviewed loads of people, didn't won one second of the protest rally.
[3:41:27.000 --> 3:41:34.000]  Not one. And these are intelligent people that they were talking to.
[3:41:34.000 --> 3:41:48.000]  If we don't fight for liberty, freedom, peace and justice, it's over.
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:53.000]  We have to unite. We have to come under one umbrella.
[3:41:53.000 --> 3:41:56.000]  If we don't, we're finished.
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:42:06.000]  This is New York City, Columbus Circle, right in the heart of it, 57th Street.
[3:42:06.000 --> 3:42:14.000]  Two, 3,000 people tops out of what? 8.3 million.
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:17.000]  We're with a.3.
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:22.000]  And we have to stop this and we can't start. We can't not finish.
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:32.000]  It has to be day after day, night after night, week after week until we win.
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:39.000]  We don't go home until freedom is restored to America.
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:43.000]  I read you that article about the economy going down in New York.
[3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:45.000]  It's going down globally.
[3:42:45.000 --> 3:42:54.000]  Get ready for the greatest oppression, like nothing we've ever seen, followed by World War III,
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:43:16.000]  unless we stop. We'll be right back.
[3:43:24.000 --> 3:43:52.000]  We'll be right back.
[3:43:54.000 --> 3:44:05.000]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on,
[3:44:05.000 --> 3:44:10.000]  and that its criminals are extremely pathological, even more the general public,
[3:44:10.000 --> 3:44:18.000]  they do the same things over and over again, and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:26.000]  Well, guess what? It was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist globalist that ran the rollout of HIV
[3:44:26.000 --> 3:44:31.000]  and the mistreatment of it with ACT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV
[3:44:31.000 --> 3:44:37.000]  and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the teen lymphocytes
[3:44:37.000 --> 3:44:40.000]  in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:46.000]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[3:44:46.000 --> 3:44:49.000]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine,
[3:44:49.000 --> 3:44:52.000]  because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system,
[3:44:52.000 --> 3:44:55.000]  basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[3:44:55.000 --> 3:45:16.000]  Let's go back in time, say, to the mid-1990s, and then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020
[3:45:16.000 --> 3:45:25.000]  where you're not allowed to fly on an airplane, because that's where we are.
[3:45:25.000 --> 3:45:31.000]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, just five years ago, if somebody told you this would be happening,
[3:45:31.000 --> 3:45:37.000]  but it is happening now, and then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy,
[3:45:37.000 --> 3:45:40.000]  and it doesn't really work, so you've got to take it every few months.
[3:45:40.000 --> 3:45:46.000]  And the people that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID,
[3:45:46.000 --> 3:45:48.000]  even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[3:45:48.000 --> 3:45:53.000]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus,
[3:45:53.000 --> 3:45:55.000]  and that's in mainline studies.
[3:45:55.000 --> 3:46:21.000]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now.

[3:50:25.000 --> 3:50:33.000]  So in today's Wall Street Journal, we got a big story down here.
[3:50:33.000 --> 3:50:49.000]  Concerts change as pandemic lingers, not pandemic lingers, as the dictators keep telling us what to do.
[3:50:49.000 --> 3:50:55.000]  Live Nation Entertainment, the world's largest concert promoter will require proof of vaccination.
[3:50:55.000 --> 3:51:01.000]  Oh, you got a negative test.
[3:51:01.000 --> 3:51:21.000]  And Schwartz Entertainment Group AEG presents will require proof of vaccination for entry into its owned and operated clubs, theaters, and festivals starting in.
[3:51:21.000 --> 3:51:32.000]  How about Auschwitz? How about VacSchwitz? How about go screw yourself and shove that vaccination needle up your, you know what?
[3:51:32.000 --> 3:51:41.000]  And by the way, telling people to f off or shove it, and of course I can't use that language, that's not profanity.
[3:51:41.000 --> 3:51:45.000]  That is proper language to use in this kind of situation.
[3:51:45.000 --> 3:51:53.000]  They tell you it's not proper language as they take the fight out of you when you're a little kid.
[3:51:53.000 --> 3:52:01.000]  It's perfectly proper language when somebody's screwing with your life.
[3:52:01.000 --> 3:52:06.000]  Then you read the front of the Wall Street Journal today.
[3:52:06.000 --> 3:52:13.000]  And that's what I told the people at there to do is I use the F word plenty of times.
[3:52:13.000 --> 3:52:19.000]  Take stokes, ex herbs, boom.
[3:52:19.000 --> 3:52:22.000]  Sit.
[3:52:22.000 --> 3:52:42.000]  And they're talking a lot about, you know, Nashville and other places, searching how it blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and ex urban areas, which include 240 counties and defined by Brookings Institute grew it almost twice the national rate.
[3:52:42.000 --> 3:52:50.000]  A shift or signs that accelerating going on and on.
[3:52:50.000 --> 3:52:54.000]  All right.
[3:52:54.000 --> 3:52:59.000]  I want to do some economics here.
[3:52:59.000 --> 3:53:03.000]  What's going to happen to commercial real estate?
[3:53:03.000 --> 3:53:07.000]  What's going to happen to commuters?
[3:53:07.000 --> 3:53:12.000]  What's going to happen to all the businesses that depend on that?
[3:53:12.000 --> 3:53:15.000]  What's going to happen?
[3:53:15.000 --> 3:53:21.000]  They're going down big, hard and fast.
[3:53:21.000 --> 3:53:25.000]  They will not be able to withstand this.
[3:53:25.000 --> 3:53:32.000]  Your office occupancy rate, again, is crumbling.
[3:53:32.000 --> 3:53:40.000]  The New York City, it's about under 20%.
[3:53:40.000 --> 3:53:47.000]  Nationally, it's under 50%.
[3:53:47.000 --> 3:53:50.000]  It's a whole new world.
[3:53:50.000 --> 3:53:58.000]  And what they do, and they're going to keep doing is what they did this past summer.
[3:53:58.000 --> 3:54:06.000]  Remember, the CDC comes out in May and so you don't have to wear your mask if you're vaccinated.
[3:54:06.000 --> 3:54:12.000]  Now, then you got to wear them.
[3:54:12.000 --> 3:54:14.000]  Then they put more restrictions on.
[3:54:14.000 --> 3:54:15.000]  Oh, then they'll let them up again.
[3:54:15.000 --> 3:54:17.000]  Then they put another level on.
[3:54:17.000 --> 3:54:20.000]  And that's what they're going to keep doing.
[3:54:20.000 --> 3:54:21.000]  You ready for this?
[3:54:21.000 --> 3:54:24.000]  Want to see where the economy is going?
[3:54:24.000 --> 3:54:26.000]  Just broke today.
[3:54:26.000 --> 3:54:46.000]  The European Union recommended Monday that it's 27 nations reinstate restrictions on tourists from the United States because of rising coronavirus infections there.
[3:54:46.000 --> 3:54:49.000]  What's that going to do to tourism?
[3:54:49.000 --> 3:54:51.000]  Tourism all around.
[3:54:51.000 --> 3:54:53.000]  It's dead.
[3:54:53.000 --> 3:54:55.000]  Dead.
[3:54:55.000 --> 3:55:01.000]  It went to the Wall Street Journal.
[3:55:01.000 --> 3:55:04.000]  One place after another.
[3:55:04.000 --> 3:55:05.000]  Where did I see it?
[3:55:05.000 --> 3:55:06.000]  I think it was this one.
[3:55:06.000 --> 3:55:07.000]  I saw it.
[3:55:07.000 --> 3:55:08.000]  It was a Guam or something.
[3:55:08.000 --> 3:55:13.000]  Where the hell was it?
[3:55:13.000 --> 3:55:18.000]  Anyway, people aren't traveling.
[3:55:18.000 --> 3:55:21.000]  It's over.
[3:55:21.000 --> 3:55:23.000]  Places are empty.
[3:55:23.000 --> 3:55:28.000]  The hospitality sector is going under.
[3:55:28.000 --> 3:55:36.000]  And totally forgotten again is the Declaration of Independence.
[3:55:36.000 --> 3:55:42.000]  When a long train of abuses and usurpations.
[3:55:42.000 --> 3:55:52.000]  Pursuing invariably the same object in vinces are designed to reduce them under absolute despotism.
[3:55:52.000 --> 3:55:55.000]  It is their right of we the people.
[3:55:55.000 --> 3:56:02.000]  It is their duty of we the people to throw off such governments.
[3:56:02.000 --> 3:56:07.000]  It is our right to do this.
[3:56:07.000 --> 3:56:09.000]  Liberty.
[3:56:09.000 --> 3:56:12.000]  Freedom.
[3:56:12.000 --> 3:56:15.000]  And the pursuit of happiness.
[3:56:15.000 --> 3:56:22.000]  The words that these little clown boys and girls have no idea what they are.
[3:56:22.000 --> 3:56:32.000]  Our inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness have been stolen from us.
[3:56:32.000 --> 3:56:39.000]  And as I read last week and I'll keep mentioning it, I don't think I did actually on this show.
[3:56:39.000 --> 3:56:47.000]  Two judges tell defendants to be vaccinated, giving legal expert, right?
[3:56:47.000 --> 3:56:55.000]  Two New York judges, J. Judge Jed Rakoff, actually, I think they spelt it wrong.
[3:56:55.000 --> 3:56:58.000]  I think there's a jerk that comes before the off.
[3:56:58.000 --> 3:57:03.000]  Said.
[3:57:03.000 --> 3:57:06.000]  Can't make this up.
[3:57:06.000 --> 3:57:18.000]  The unvaccinated pose the danger given their enhanced risk of infecting other innocent people and even potentially causing self deaths.
[3:57:18.000 --> 3:57:22.000]  Could you believe this?
[3:57:22.000 --> 3:57:24.000]  All aboard next train to Auschwitz.
[3:57:24.000 --> 3:57:27.000]  They would have loved you over there.
[3:57:27.000 --> 3:57:29.000]  Hey, if you're vaccinated, you're safe.
[3:57:29.000 --> 3:57:30.000]  No, you're killing people.
[3:57:30.000 --> 3:57:32.000]  Take them away.
[3:57:32.000 --> 3:57:34.000]  Take them away.
[3:57:34.000 --> 3:57:36.000]  So again, thank you for tuning in.
[3:57:36.000 --> 3:57:38.000]  And remember to keep following me.
[3:57:38.000 --> 3:58:07.000]  And go to Gerald Slenty at Twitter and trendsjournal.com to read history before it happens and support info wars.
