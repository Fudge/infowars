[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:38.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.080 --> 00:48.000]  ladies and gentlemen it is Monday the 30th day of September 2013 we're going to
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.680]  be live here for the next three hours covering the most important information
[00:53.680 --> 00:59.560]  that I can possibly imagine concerning the future of this country and the world
[00:59.560 --> 01:06.040]  I have all of my reporters and writers listening to me right now because I told
[01:06.040 --> 01:10.720]  them I wanted them to tune in as they do most days to the radio broadcast because
[01:10.720 --> 01:20.720]  I want to have the full focus of the Info Wars operation in the next week on
[01:20.720 --> 01:35.560]  what's hiding in plain view and that is the economic takeover of this country
[01:35.560 --> 01:46.120]  this morning I had just an intense understanding and yesterday on the
[01:46.120 --> 01:59.560]  radio there in the Sunday broadcast I had an epiphany on this subject and it's
[01:59.560 --> 02:05.760]  something we've actually stated over and over again on air but the magnitude of
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.160]  it hit me like a ton of bricks yesterday evening on the Sunday radio show
[02:10.160 --> 02:16.160]  four to six p.m. Central and then the magnitude this morning hit me so hard
[02:16.160 --> 02:24.560]  there's that saying that common saying that and then it hit me I woke up it it
[02:24.560 --> 02:31.320]  hit me suddenly it all became clear and it was clear before but now it's so
[02:31.320 --> 02:35.280]  incredibly clear it boggles the mind have you ever looked into a mountain
[02:35.280 --> 02:40.720]  stream that's still and it's so clear it almost makes the things on the bottom
[02:40.720 --> 02:45.600]  look even more clear than if it was just air you were looking through it's like
[02:45.600 --> 02:54.640]  the water magnifies it to a crystal clear magnification I'm not even going to say
[02:54.640 --> 03:00.520]  what it is until we come back on the other side of this break we're gonna get
[03:00.520 --> 03:05.680]  into the government shutdown that's the heart of it but I even meant to get into
[03:05.680 --> 03:10.160]  the office early today and and write some notes along these points and I had
[03:10.160 --> 03:16.040]  time to do some of that but mainly we just pulled articles to back up what I'm
[03:16.040 --> 03:25.480]  gonna be talking about here but this is the biggest most important thing that I
[03:25.480 --> 03:30.400]  have ever covered undoubtedly and you'll notice if you were a Lister 15 16 17
[03:30.400 --> 03:34.160]  18 years ago I would never really talk like that and then maybe once a year I'd
[03:34.160 --> 03:37.120]  say this is the most important news we ever covered because things just get
[03:37.120 --> 03:41.080]  crazy as time goes on and then once every six months I'd say it then every
[03:41.080 --> 03:46.560]  month and now every couple weeks and now every day it's just accelerating in a
[03:46.560 --> 03:57.160]  quickening here but it all just hit me like a battering ram upside the head but
[03:57.160 --> 04:00.760]  not a battering ram that knocks you down and stuns you a battering ram that
[04:00.760 --> 04:08.360]  knocks you into full crystal clear understanding of the entire compendium
[04:08.360 --> 04:14.000]  of the globalist operation on their plan and then you can go out and see in
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.800]  their own statements every piece of that compendium it's not just like I'm
[04:17.800 --> 04:24.040]  sitting back recognizing it and seeing it they're all admitting it but still one
[04:24.040 --> 04:33.720]  staggers it staggers the mind to see them really doing it and to realize how
[04:33.720 --> 04:38.600]  much trouble we're in but the minute we fully realize just how serious this is
[04:38.600 --> 04:43.240]  and just how criminal these people are and they're not gonna give us quarter
[04:43.240 --> 04:47.720]  that is a great moment of victory and we turn the tide at that point because
[04:47.720 --> 04:52.240]  then you realize they are predatory they are the enemy they are not going to
[04:52.240 --> 04:56.720]  stop and all we can do is stand up against them and not have fear it comes
[04:56.720 --> 05:03.960]  down to that the world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight
[05:03.960 --> 05:08.840]  against life-threatening pathogens and as a result dozens of silver solutions
[05:08.840 --> 05:12.720]  have emerged you can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage
[05:12.720 --> 05:17.560]  how do you know which solution is the safest and most effective supernatural

[05:22.920 --> 05:28.160]  this technology is so powerful it must be made in a laboratory colloidal and
[05:28.160 --> 05:33.480]  ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current making supernatural
[05:33.480 --> 05:38.320]  silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses bacteria and fungus

[08:23.040 --> 08:31.320]  the resistance it's Alex Jones
[08:31.320 --> 08:36.160]  ladies and gentlemen here we are live broadcasting worldwide on this 30th day
[08:36.160 --> 08:43.440]  of September 2013 Geraldo Rivera is scheduled to be coming on the broadcast
[08:43.440 --> 08:47.000]  talk about world events Syria the economy government shutdown you name it
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.520]  sometime in the third hour today Dr. Jerome course he's been set up for
[08:51.520 --> 08:55.720]  weeks to come on about his new book about 50 years after who really killed JFK we
[08:55.720 --> 08:59.320]  know it was a conspiracy but he's tied it down to who really did it and it
[08:59.320 --> 09:03.400]  concurs with my deep research and analysis on the subject but we're gonna
[09:03.400 --> 09:06.760]  spend about 30 minutes of course he on that the first 30 minutes on world news
[09:06.760 --> 09:11.040]  upfront I'm gonna get into the government shutdown that we're like 15
[09:11.040 --> 09:15.800]  hours out from and the fact that it's not really a government shutdown coming up
[09:15.800 --> 09:20.920]  at the bottom of the hour and I will be covering the government shutdown when I
[09:20.920 --> 09:25.040]  get into this news here in just a moment but I will specifically look at the
[09:25.040 --> 09:30.200]  Obamacare and the in the so-called shutdown at the bottom of the hour to
[09:30.200 --> 09:36.680]  cover something of the magnitude that I'm about to discuss is very hard to do
[09:36.680 --> 09:45.160]  because there's so much proof it's like closing arguments in a murder trial and
[09:45.160 --> 09:49.640]  the murderer has been caught with a hundred dead bodies buried in their
[09:49.640 --> 09:53.640]  basement of little children and shot hundreds of hours of video of them
[09:53.640 --> 09:59.480]  torturing the children and it's hands down absolute fact this person should
[09:59.480 --> 10:03.080]  go to the electric chair this is the analogy of the globalist being the
[10:03.080 --> 10:08.240]  killer but if we don't follow all the procedures correctly they'll get off on
[10:08.240 --> 10:14.120]  a technicality and that's why I say I don't feel like I'm worthy it's why I
[10:14.120 --> 10:17.240]  say I don't want people calling and telling me how great I am because
[10:17.240 --> 10:21.600]  sometimes I do have moments of clarity and moments of great understanding but
[10:21.600 --> 10:33.080]  most the time it's the opposite and I don't want to just get up here and run
[10:33.080 --> 10:41.160]  through all these facts and have it just go out there into the ether and bounce
[10:41.160 --> 10:45.400]  off of people and not have an effect I need you the listeners of this radio
[10:45.400 --> 10:50.800]  show to listen very carefully to what I'm going to say in the next 30 minutes I
[10:50.800 --> 10:57.200]  need you to write notes on what I'm going to say I need you to go to the news
[10:57.200 --> 11:00.720]  articles and documents I'm going to be showing you and read them for yourself
[11:00.720 --> 11:05.600]  so that you know that I'm telling you the truth and then I need you to take
[11:05.600 --> 11:09.120]  action on this information
[11:09.120 --> 11:17.480]  I talked about what you're about to hear the report I'm about to give you the
[11:17.480 --> 11:21.240]  briefing I'm about to give you on the show for about 10 minutes last night the
[11:21.240 --> 11:28.360]  Sunday broadcast 4 to 6 p.m. and it hit me really hard during the show looking
[11:28.360 --> 11:32.720]  at the government shutdown what it really was and then it hit me this morning
[11:32.720 --> 11:38.400]  the strongest I've ever been hit with understanding that I need to focus on
[11:38.400 --> 11:44.720]  this and I told my reporters this morning the news reporters the print
[11:44.720 --> 11:51.080]  reporters everyone I said I want in the next week the next month the next year
[11:51.080 --> 11:57.240]  you to hammer every angle of what I'm about to cover here and we need all the
[11:57.240 --> 12:01.120]  other reporters out there whether your establishment mainstream or whether your
[12:01.120 --> 12:05.160]  local talk radio or whether your print whether you call yourself a liberal a
[12:05.160 --> 12:12.240]  conservative a libertarian a communist whatever it is if you really care about
[12:12.240 --> 12:19.560]  reality you need to listen to me very very carefully you know a lot of people
[12:19.560 --> 12:24.240]  are on a power trip or a lot of people are on an insecure trip a lot of people
[12:24.240 --> 12:28.480]  think their whole life is about their ego itself not about being part of the
[12:28.480 --> 12:32.360]  human community and striving to build something better but I realize this
[12:32.360 --> 12:40.360]  weekend I'm on a reality trip and I want you to join me on a reality trip there
[12:40.360 --> 12:45.440]  is no rest for those of us that really seek after reality not what we want to
[12:45.440 --> 12:50.360]  believe not what not what you know of all the propaganda they give us different
[12:50.360 --> 12:55.520]  flavors so we can choose which flavor of globalist cyanide lace kool-aid we want
[12:55.520 --> 12:58.280]  to drink you know there's 20 different flavors of kool-aid but they're all
[12:58.280 --> 13:06.520]  laced with cyanide in this new world order aka Jim Jones and I've really been
[13:06.520 --> 13:10.400]  braced by the fact of just how accurate we've been but of course we've been
[13:10.400 --> 13:16.520]  accurate because the globalist have hidden in plain view in council on
[13:16.520 --> 13:21.240]  farm relations publications and Club of Rome statements and Devo statements and
[13:21.240 --> 13:28.480]  leaked Bilderberg documents and c-span conversations and ran corporation
[13:28.480 --> 13:34.520]  programs ran corporation said in 1998 it was in the Austin America states for an
[13:34.520 --> 13:39.600]  article about it I went to the library actually pulled the full report and they
[13:39.600 --> 13:43.400]  said we're gonna be have troops on every checkpoint we're gonna have tanks
[13:43.400 --> 13:46.400]  going up down the road armored vehicles we're gonna arrest people for their free
[13:46.400 --> 13:50.440]  speech we're gonna federalize all local police we're gonna take everybody's
[13:50.440 --> 13:57.120]  liberties and there's Fox News today US police obtaining military vehicles to
[13:57.120 --> 14:02.320]  aid hunt for criminals giant homeland security armored vehicles used in Iraq
[14:02.320 --> 14:07.480]  Dallas is getting scores of them they're producing about 7,000 a year of just one
[14:07.480 --> 14:12.040]  brand to be deployed to local police they're gearing up for all-out war with
[14:12.040 --> 14:17.720]  the American people folks these are armored vehicles that can take five
[14:17.720 --> 14:21.960]  pounds of C4 detonating under them they are preparing for all-out war with us
[14:21.960 --> 14:27.120]  folks and you better ask yourself why second command of the country's nuclear
[14:27.120 --> 14:31.360]  arsenal is suspended as he is investigated for gambling you really
[14:31.360 --> 14:36.320]  believe that no there's coup d'etat going on in the government and they're
[14:36.320 --> 14:41.320]  going after anybody won't play a ball with them we are on the razor's edge
[14:41.320 --> 14:45.680]  ladies and gentlemen of a hot war with the globalist that have occupied the
[14:45.680 --> 14:48.120]  United States
[14:53.600 --> 15:01.920]  let me now let me now break down the betrayal let me now break down what
[15:01.920 --> 15:09.200]  we're really facing let me now as best I can as simply as I can and then go in
[15:09.200 --> 15:15.640]  and fill in all the documentation tell you what's happened and for many of you
[15:15.640 --> 15:20.480]  you'll say we already know that you've said this for 18 years we've been
[15:20.480 --> 15:24.520]  saying it forever Ron Paul's pointed it out the globalist to bragged about it
[15:24.520 --> 15:29.120]  they get up on CNBC and say we've been occupied and conquered by international
[15:29.120 --> 15:34.960]  banks aren't we all just slaves to the Federal Reserve but that has to hit home
[15:34.960 --> 15:41.480]  and realize that's not hyperbole that's not exaggeration like a bullet to the
[15:41.480 --> 15:48.040]  brain we've got to really get this with clarity it's got a really drill into
[15:48.040 --> 15:53.040]  there that this is real they're not going to let any private individual
[15:53.040 --> 15:56.760]  companies operate they're not going to let you have a family business they're
[15:56.760 --> 16:00.200]  not going to let you live your life they're going to break us and fully
[16:00.200 --> 16:04.040]  collectivize us and how they're going to do that is the same way they've done
[16:04.040 --> 16:13.120]  it everywhere else and that's the big epiphany we know the globalist put the
[16:13.120 --> 16:17.120]  communist Chinese in power shipped most our jobs over there to leverage out
[16:17.120 --> 16:21.200]  Western economies and deindustrialize us so that then people can only work for
[16:21.200 --> 16:25.080]  government or select corporations that got government contracts to create a
[16:25.080 --> 16:31.560]  command and control economy for total control but we're now entering the end
[16:31.560 --> 16:38.720]  game of this and this has been done in Brazil this has been done in Nigeria this
[16:38.720 --> 16:42.400]  has been done in South Africa this has been done all over Asia it's been done
[16:42.400 --> 16:47.800]  to the Japanese the last 18 years it's been done to Eastern Europe it's been
[16:47.800 --> 16:53.240]  done to Greece it's been done to Iceland who's been fighting back this is the
[16:53.240 --> 16:57.600]  same plan here's an example back in the 1970s you can look it up they gave a
[16:57.600 --> 17:03.200]  billion dollar IMF World Bank loan to Nigeria last time I checked Nigeria had
[17:03.200 --> 17:08.200]  paid back more than 40 billion dollars of it and still owed close to a hundred
[17:08.200 --> 17:12.840]  billion more with all their different debts on a billion dollar loan it makes
[17:12.840 --> 17:18.600]  loan sharking look look tame and comparison look at Greece they're
[17:18.600 --> 17:22.560]  signed on to the globalist derivatives hundreds of billions just for their
[17:22.560 --> 17:29.160]  little country 90 plus percent of it on record isn't they're dead they're signed
[17:29.160 --> 17:33.040]  on to it and the very bankers who they're propping up then come in and
[17:33.040 --> 17:37.680]  raise the taxes implode the economy to further destroy it to then buy
[17:37.680 --> 17:42.960]  everything up for pennies on the dollar and they have big symposiums in Athens
[17:42.960 --> 17:46.400]  with world leaders bragging they're ripping everyone off they don't even
[17:46.400 --> 17:54.320]  hide it and that's the big epiphany here is that we all need to have the
[17:54.320 --> 17:58.480]  epiphany we need to have the awakening and really understand that just because
[17:58.480 --> 18:03.200]  we've known incrementally this was coming now it's here just like in 2008 in
[18:03.200 --> 18:09.880]  October they said you will give unlimited trillions of dollars to offshore
[18:09.880 --> 18:13.840]  private banks and Congress can't see who's getting it under the banker bailout
[18:13.840 --> 18:19.400]  the first round was 800 plus billion it turned into 40 plus trillion last time
[18:19.400 --> 18:23.920]  Bloomberg broke the numbers down in one form or another of looting that's four
[18:23.920 --> 18:33.240]  or five times the GDP in a year I mean they are robbing us to destroy us they
[18:33.240 --> 18:36.560]  can't even spend or use all this what they're doing will wreck the world
[18:36.560 --> 18:41.560]  economy it is a blitzkrieg economic attack it's it's it's it's economic
[18:41.560 --> 18:45.560]  scorched earth it's been done in Mexico it's done every decade there or so it's
[18:45.560 --> 18:50.880]  been done everywhere this is what the globalists do to countries and this is
[18:50.880 --> 18:57.160]  what Joe Stiglitz exposed when he left the World Bank back in 2002 and thousands
[18:57.160 --> 19:03.400]  of pages of documents got leaked he's a Nobel Prize winner for economics that
[19:03.400 --> 19:07.640]  they were then planning to implode Western Europe the US Australia New Zealand
[19:07.640 --> 19:12.680]  Canada Western nations the same way they've done the third world so that's
[19:12.680 --> 19:16.480]  even in my book to sent into tyranny that's been out of print for five years
[19:16.480 --> 19:21.040]  you can read it online at prismplina.tv that interview the transcript the
[19:21.040 --> 19:25.520]  documents 2002's on that book came out so you're saying well we already know
[19:25.520 --> 19:31.360]  this no no no the point is is that they know you're awake to banker bailouts
[19:31.360 --> 19:36.080]  direct taxes to private banks so the banks own the big insurance companies on
[19:36.080 --> 19:42.080]  average. Obamacare is another direct tax ruled a direct tax to the banks through
[19:42.080 --> 19:48.040]  the insurance companies as another looting program and then when they hold
[19:48.040 --> 19:51.480]  us hostage and say the faith and credit of the US will be destroyed if you don't
[19:51.480 --> 19:55.280]  give into this they're treating us just like a third world country who's being
[19:55.280 --> 20:01.600]  held hostage and that's the big key when we come back. Hi this is Ted Anderson
[20:01.600 --> 20:04.680]  have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't
[20:04.680 --> 20:08.800]  talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986 yet the financial
[20:08.800 --> 20:12.360]  industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is out
[20:12.360 --> 20:16.240]  perform paper investments yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have
[20:16.240 --> 20:21.280]  gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by

[20:35.680 --> 20:39.240]  bank having it led back at interest forcing taxes to serve as debt. This
[20:39.240 --> 20:42.560]  capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the
[20:42.560 --> 20:45.320]  public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a
[20:45.320 --> 20:48.240]  standing army. Ted Anderson I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that
[20:48.240 --> 20:53.520]  explains our monetary system call for your copy 800-686-2237. It's time to
[20:53.520 --> 21:00.520]  understand the system call 800-686-2237 that's 800-686-2237. We travel so much
[21:00.520 --> 21:06.160]  and having a fake TV gives added peace of mind. Burglars look for houses that
[21:06.160 --> 21:11.800]  appear to be easy targets but fake TV can fool even professional burglars into
[21:11.800 --> 21:15.880]  thinking someone is home watching television. As a recent widow living alone
[21:15.880 --> 21:20.680]  it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that
[21:20.680 --> 21:24.920]  passing motors and pedestrians will think someone is on watching TV when I'm
[21:24.920 --> 21:30.280]  actually away from home. Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light
[21:30.280 --> 21:34.560]  on a timer and they're so easy to use you just plug them in and they're ready to
[21:34.560 --> 21:39.680]  go plus they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs. Fake TV is

[24:00.320 --> 24:23.400]  I told you that I had an epiphany and the epiphany the ton of bricks that hit
[24:23.400 --> 24:32.360]  me this morning is that we can beat these people if and only if we can get the
[24:32.360 --> 24:36.600]  truth out to the American people that we really are occupied and that the
[24:36.600 --> 24:43.080]  occupiers want to impoverish us as a tool of political control and that was
[24:43.080 --> 24:49.200]  really it watching Fox CNN MSNBC over the weekend reading hundreds of news
[24:49.200 --> 24:56.320]  articles on the government shutdown the talking point is you give us Obamacare
[24:56.320 --> 25:00.320]  and you do what you're told or we'll lose our faith and credit and the
[25:00.320 --> 25:03.880]  communist Chinese that own and run America along with the private offshore
[25:03.880 --> 25:10.240]  Federal Reserve that's a foreign bank the shareholders are mainly European we
[25:10.240 --> 25:14.360]  will shut the economy down just like Henry Paulson threatened to do back in
[25:14.360 --> 25:19.280]  2008 and that foreign interest are holding America host is just like
[25:19.280 --> 25:25.800]  we're Mexico or Brazil or Nigeria just like we're Greece and foreigners come
[25:25.800 --> 25:29.320]  in foreign corporations and get their private islands and get their state
[25:29.320 --> 25:34.080]  parks and their national parks and their infrastructure and their roads and their
[25:34.080 --> 25:39.440]  water factories and their power plants the whole infrastructure is being looted
[25:39.440 --> 25:45.040]  out to globalist not to just steal it and control it but to steal it and
[25:45.040 --> 25:49.760]  control it and double triple prices to impoverish us to convert us to debtor
[25:49.760 --> 25:54.560]  slaves as a political tool of control I mean this isn't just like some foreign
[25:54.560 --> 25:58.160]  enemy that invades and takes over your government so they run things and puts a
[25:58.160 --> 26:02.760]  puppet in charge so that you know at least the local vice for a is say
[26:02.760 --> 26:07.800]  Indian and you're in India this is foreign megabanks with paramilitary
[26:07.800 --> 26:12.520]  police in place for the American people not for al-Qaeda they say it's for gun
[26:12.520 --> 26:16.480]  owners conservatives libertarians anti-fellow reserve people folks that
[26:16.480 --> 26:21.480]  no America's occupied TV shows movies dramas cartoons demonizing the founders
[26:21.480 --> 26:27.660]  gun owners armored vehicles SWAT teams everywhere preparing for war with us the
[26:27.660 --> 26:31.560]  good news this has been waking up the SWAT teams because they're going we're
[26:31.560 --> 26:35.320]  training that Americans are bad and I thought this was for al-Qaeda you see
[26:35.320 --> 26:41.360]  this is a total takeover folks and it's the bankers that took over America the
[26:41.360 --> 26:44.880]  robber barons a hundred plus years ago that set up the Federal Reserve it set
[26:44.880 --> 26:50.400]  up the UN to be their international takeover arm they already took America
[26:50.400 --> 26:54.400]  over now they're taking the world over with our money our military but now
[26:54.400 --> 26:57.640]  they don't want to just run the banks and the government they want to run
[26:57.640 --> 27:01.560]  everything they want to run your life they're saying hey your kids don't belong
[27:01.560 --> 27:05.720]  to you on the news every day they're saying we're going to teach your kids
[27:05.720 --> 27:09.640]  what we want we're going to teach five year olds how to have anal sex and how
[27:09.640 --> 27:15.040]  to masturbate at school and if you call it pedophilia will arrest you because if
[27:15.040 --> 27:17.480]  they can get away with that then get with anything they're setting the
[27:17.480 --> 27:22.400]  precedent and I just realized man they really are going to come after everybody
[27:22.400 --> 27:27.320]  we really have been right the worst-case scenario is a hundred percent certified
[27:27.320 --> 27:34.040]  we are in a world of you know what and the only way out of it is to speak out
[27:34.040 --> 27:38.480]  and get really aggressive and stop implying and also folks prepare to
[27:38.480 --> 27:41.640]  defend ourselves because there's a good chance they'll nuke a city or blow up
[27:41.640 --> 27:45.920]  federal buildings and try to arrest you know thousands of leaders and go after
[27:45.920 --> 27:51.120]  people and if they if they convert that sweep then Katie bar the door folks
[27:51.120 --> 27:54.560]  they're coming for you next and I wouldn't want to be the military and
[27:54.560 --> 27:57.600]  police by the way you guys are smart enough to know the globalists want to
[27:57.600 --> 28:01.920]  destroy you in the war with us it's full spectrum dominance just like it and
[28:01.920 --> 28:05.920]  she eyed the city to kill each other Patriot and paramilitary to kill each
[28:05.920 --> 28:09.880]  other why don't we join forces against the new world order and just speak out
[28:09.880 --> 28:13.280]  against it and they and they will they will they will grind like a tank in the
[28:13.280 --> 28:20.880]  mud like Barbarossa in the mud right it right it right it right at Leningrad but
[28:20.880 --> 28:24.680]  I'm telling you right now ladies and gentlemen you've got to realize how life
[28:24.680 --> 28:31.160]  and death this is I mean my life is just electric now I'm not even scared I'm on

[28:40.560 --> 28:45.760]  properly I feel like I've aged 20 years not in a bad way I feel like an old man

[28:51.040 --> 28:54.800]  folks and that's when everything connects and the understanding intensifies

[33:52.640 --> 33:58.320]  wars nightly news okay let me get right to the heart of all this
[33:58.600 --> 34:04.720]  Obamacare is a takedown of the economy Obamacare is the shutdown of America
[34:04.720 --> 34:11.520]  Obamacare is the takedown of one seventh more of the economy and it's also a
[34:11.520 --> 34:15.760]  direct tax as ruled by the Supreme Court I told you that before they ruled at
[34:15.760 --> 34:20.920]  that to private select mega corporations mega banks that own the big
[34:20.920 --> 34:24.960]  insurance companies and it allows them to shut down all the other smaller
[34:24.960 --> 34:29.840]  insurance companies HMOs and health care providers that aren't part of the
[34:29.840 --> 34:35.120]  establishment they savagely just like under Tyson chicken and AP investigation
[34:35.120 --> 34:41.240]  back in 1997 a small firm could have one chicken violation Tyson could have
[34:41.240 --> 34:47.240]  1100 at one plant not even get a fine it's the same deal they are shutting
[34:47.240 --> 34:53.000]  everything down a microcosm of that was when they nationalized globalized
[34:53.000 --> 34:59.040]  bankerized with taxpayer money general motors all over the country democratic
[34:59.040 --> 35:07.080]  donors were given given people that weren't donors or Republicans Chevy

[35:15.480 --> 35:21.280]  this to the Hyundai person next door that's a Democrat that's on record
[35:21.280 --> 35:26.160]  folks this is just hardcore mafia everything you see in movies like good
[35:26.160 --> 35:33.780]  fellas times a thousand literally and it is the takeover of society at every
[35:33.780 --> 35:38.520]  level and the Republican leadership goes along with it they're selling two
[35:38.520 --> 35:42.640]  three four five million dollar robots to every major city to disarm imaginary
[35:42.640 --> 35:48.360]  bombs they're selling one armored vehicle that costs hundreds of thousands of
[35:48.360 --> 35:52.880]  dollars giant armored tanks use in Iraq to every major university they're
[35:52.880 --> 35:57.480]  selling to cities like Dallas dozens of them they're training openly for war
[35:57.480 --> 36:03.040]  with us and again it's our money they use to then prepare for war with us and
[36:03.040 --> 36:05.880]  then it's all going to be needed because they're going to implode the economy
[36:05.880 --> 36:09.560]  which then becomes the self-fulfilling prophecy and then more of the economy
[36:09.560 --> 36:18.400]  selectively gets sent to them until it's like soylent green and well you know
[36:18.400 --> 36:21.600]  you got it really bad but at least you're a cop and got some authority yeah
[36:21.600 --> 36:25.440]  your pension funds gone but you know what are you gonna do and you know at
[36:25.440 --> 36:29.720]  least you got a paycheck from the force so you're told to mow people down in
[36:29.720 --> 36:34.200]  Dallas Texas who are out there rioting because you know there's no food while
[36:34.200 --> 36:42.680]  you do it and after all the people rioting didn't save food didn't fight to
[36:42.680 --> 36:47.280]  have a free country supported Obamacare so you know folks will be hiding out in
[36:47.280 --> 36:50.760]  the countryside rooting for the cops when they mow down the hordes of people
[36:50.760 --> 36:54.200]  because it's better than them getting to your neighborhood but then the globalist
[36:54.200 --> 36:57.960]  again created this atmosphere and they'll get to you in the countryside
[36:57.960 --> 37:03.240]  later two three years after the collapse they've all computerized and
[37:03.240 --> 37:07.800]  actually worried out what they call the science of government in this program
[37:07.800 --> 37:12.560]  look up the paper the science of government look up companies that say
[37:12.560 --> 37:16.520]  they help with the science of government it's all former top DARPA heads and
[37:16.520 --> 37:21.760]  people with Google and others all admitting this takeover they're gonna
[37:21.760 --> 37:26.560]  have an industrialized world behind armored compounds you are going to have
[37:26.560 --> 37:30.480]  nothing unless you agree to sterilization and shots and the rest of it I
[37:30.480 --> 37:36.520]  mean this is hell a scientifically deployed takeover that this is just the
[37:36.520 --> 37:41.800]  beginning of and and and we're five years a decade out maybe sooner depending
[37:41.800 --> 37:45.080]  on how are we fight we can hold it back from them actually getting this in
[37:45.080 --> 37:49.760]  place we're trying to hold it back we've we've we've been holding it back it's
[37:49.760 --> 37:53.440]  over a decade behind Brzezinski and others say but here here's what I'm
[37:53.440 --> 37:57.800]  trying to get across to you this is a scientific takeover it's the opposite of
[37:57.800 --> 38:02.560]  prosperity globalism is enslavement globalism is poverty globalism is
[38:02.560 --> 38:06.360]  forced sterilization globalism is collectivism for the general public
[38:06.360 --> 38:12.080]  fascism at the top above the law with diplomatic immunity the new world order
[38:12.080 --> 38:21.880]  is anathema to prosperity it is the enemy of 99.99999% of people there's
[38:21.880 --> 38:29.000]  only 6,000 globalists superclass in their own words and this system is a war
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.800]  against us that are seen as an infestation on the earth and an
[38:32.800 --> 38:37.040]  emergency plague they've got to take out at the top they believe that they are
[38:37.040 --> 38:41.400]  these military tacticians trying to save the planet and folks even if that is
[38:41.400 --> 38:47.200]  true even if you go with that debate understand you're not you're not part
[38:47.200 --> 38:52.440]  of the winning team here there are other ways to off-world the population
[38:52.440 --> 38:56.320]  undersea programs clean energies because while they say they're saving the
[38:56.320 --> 38:59.720]  earth getting rid of us they're blocking clean industrial developments
[38:59.720 --> 39:04.720]  they're blocking systems they're blocking middle-class population which
[39:04.720 --> 39:09.520]  then lowers the birth rate to negative they're targeting the west more than
[39:09.520 --> 39:13.240]  anybody because they see the west and the and the system of the west and the
[39:13.240 --> 39:18.440]  and the high IQ of the west as a threat in their own words so even their own
[39:18.440 --> 39:22.560]  claim that they're doing all this to save the earth is not true because they
[39:22.560 --> 39:27.040]  want nanotech and genetic engineering so they can live longer they are just
[39:27.040 --> 39:33.360]  open air in tens of thousands of laboratories full tilt boogie splicing
[39:33.360 --> 39:40.240]  every plant animal insect together open air I mean these people are out of their
[39:40.240 --> 39:44.480]  minds I indict the entire power structure you people are decadent you're
[39:44.480 --> 39:47.440]  out of your minds you're listening to all these scientists that will get that
[39:47.440 --> 39:51.560]  get unlimited funding out of your systems in a big power grab there's
[39:51.560 --> 39:56.880]  different sectors competing with each other within the globalist combine
[39:57.360 --> 40:02.760]  there's no control they're in control of us they're not in control of themselves
[40:02.760 --> 40:07.280]  and they're hurtling us off the edge of a cliff so I'm ranting here folks when I
[40:07.280 --> 40:10.800]  say I have an epiphany it's thousands of points together giving me a clear
[40:10.800 --> 40:19.000]  absolute crystalline image of exactly what we're facing as a society and we
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.720]  are being broken we have been occupied in the central power hubs state
[40:23.720 --> 40:28.120]  government federal government regulations internet all that the
[40:28.120 --> 40:32.640]  families in deep trouble societies collapsing IQs are dropping cancer rates
[40:32.640 --> 40:36.760]  are exploding we're under soft kill right now but a lower level of it now
[40:36.760 --> 40:40.280]  they think we are like the frog in the pot where the water gets hot the frog
[40:40.280 --> 40:46.560]  passes out now they're turning it up on high thinking we can't get out and the
[40:46.560 --> 40:51.200]  frog has kind of passed out for a while but kind of woke up for a minute that's
[40:51.200 --> 40:54.720]  what's happening and it realizes it's in trouble and the systems like stay in the
[40:54.720 --> 41:00.000]  water I love you sweetie stay right there don't listen to the extremist and we
[41:00.000 --> 41:05.080]  collectively are the cells in the frog who want to survive the collective race
[41:05.080 --> 41:08.400]  consciousness of the frog going I got to get out I got to get out I got to get
[41:08.400 --> 41:12.760]  out I got to get out they're like and the armored vehicles and the cameras and
[41:12.760 --> 41:16.080]  the fluoride in the water and all of it and the dumbing down just stay in the
[41:16.080 --> 41:19.160]  water stay in the water lay back it's gonna be all right we keep them down on
[41:19.160 --> 41:23.160]  the gurney keep them down we've almost got them you understand what I'm saying
[41:23.160 --> 41:27.280]  ladies and gentlemen the vampires are all over us ladies and gentlemen and they
[41:27.280 --> 41:31.120]  are trying to suck the last lifeblood out of us so we pass out and they've won
[41:31.120 --> 41:37.040]  and we've got to get up we got to get up folks this is scientifically deployed I've
[41:37.040 --> 41:40.080]  probably read a hundred books where they admit all this how they're
[41:40.080 --> 41:44.040]  scientifically deploying how they're gonna soft kill us and dumb us down so we
[41:44.040 --> 41:47.760]  don't notice and can't resist the full takeover I mean it is hellish and let me
[41:47.760 --> 41:51.760]  tell people that are military or police you are the number one enemy once this
[41:51.760 --> 41:54.400]  thing goes through you already notice they've changed the narrative over from
[41:54.400 --> 41:59.000]  al-qaeda to veterans gun owners and the internal documents retired police you
[41:59.000 --> 42:03.760]  are absolutely historically you know they come after you after they take over
[42:03.760 --> 42:10.120]  you are dead bare minimum put on list everything taken your pension taken to
[42:10.120 --> 42:14.840]  make you destitute and poor they're coming after you I mean especially if
[42:14.840 --> 42:19.880]  you're a military person currently or a veteran you already know this ladies and
[42:19.880 --> 42:24.520]  gentlemen this is a death sentence it is a suicide pact to serve these people
[42:24.520 --> 42:30.520]  every reason of honor and duty and common sense and your family says you
[42:30.520 --> 42:35.160]  must wake up and speak out against this most of you the last decade have been
[42:35.160 --> 42:38.520]  selected because they think you'll follow orders they think you're dumb they
[42:38.520 --> 42:42.880]  think that you're compartmentalized they think you're on a power trip but let me
[42:42.880 --> 42:48.000]  tell you even if you have a low IQ because of environment and they claim
[42:48.000 --> 42:53.480]  genetics that's not true all the science shows under crises not just mammals not
[42:53.480 --> 42:59.360]  just humans but other life forms have systems in the mind in the cells in the
[42:59.360 --> 43:04.400]  DNA and everything to literally in a crisis if you admit you're under attack
[43:04.400 --> 43:10.200]  you can literally have a brain boost that's what this is really all about
[43:10.200 --> 43:14.640]  and you're going to have to admit that you've been conned and that you've been
[43:14.640 --> 43:18.480]  just like Obamacare supporters have to admit you've been conned and get out of
[43:18.480 --> 43:21.840]  the con if you're ever going to turn this around you don't have to be morons
[43:21.840 --> 43:27.160]  I mean here's an example Obamacare website quietly deletes references to
[43:27.160 --> 43:30.200]  free health care law yeah before the Obamacare site said you'll get your
[43:30.200 --> 43:38.680]  free health care now it says we're gonna get my low-cost care she the the fix is
[43:38.680 --> 43:43.720]  in folks now that they've got it through or right on the cusp oh god you know by
[43:43.720 --> 43:47.720]  the way we're gonna increase the price oh by the way the old charity care you
[43:47.720 --> 43:51.280]  could get that's gone now you will not get free health care anymore it's the
[43:51.280 --> 43:57.560]  opposite of what they said so let me now get to the heart of everything I've
[43:57.560 --> 44:01.120]  been trying to say here in this first hour today please listen to me please
[44:01.120 --> 44:05.920]  take this recording on podcast or the video of it off prison planet TV or off
[44:05.920 --> 44:12.120]  YouTube and get it out to everyone you know please watch the whole thing because
[44:12.120 --> 44:16.680]  what I'm saying is we're in a trap we're in a scientific takeover and if you
[44:16.680 --> 44:21.880]  admit that and study it and find out I've told you the truth they morally and
[44:21.880 --> 44:26.400]  culturally cannot complete this takeover if they don't have the support of the
[44:26.400 --> 44:30.440]  people and if you're aware of the occupation you are designed to fight a
[44:30.440 --> 44:35.280]  foreign enemy that invades and attacks you and you're designed to fight a
[44:35.280 --> 44:39.240]  frontal assault you're not designed to fight armies of men in suits that put
[44:39.240 --> 44:44.600]  out propaganda and that manipulate and incrementally take over an engineer
[44:44.600 --> 44:50.200]  crises to poses the savior always then creating a bigger crises they created
[44:50.200 --> 44:55.120]  the banker bailout the too big to fail the derivatives they grabbed 47 trillion
[44:55.120 --> 44:58.760]  of us taxpayer money gave it to offshore banks on record won't tell Congress
[44:58.760 --> 45:01.560]  where it went things got worse derivatives are even bigger than they
[45:01.560 --> 45:06.120]  were five years ago now they say we need Obamacare or the whole world will
[45:06.120 --> 45:09.360]  pull out of their investments here and we'll collapse they're holding us
[45:09.360 --> 45:13.280]  hostage the globalist the IMF the World Bank the Federal Reserve the private
[45:13.280 --> 45:17.480]  banks Goldman Sachs JP Morgan brag they control the Communist Chinese Party
[45:17.480 --> 45:22.120]  they've made them members of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan in China the heads of
[45:22.120 --> 45:27.400]  the Communist Party are on the board of directors look it up Bank of America you
[45:27.400 --> 45:32.880]  name it Wells Fargo under their Chinese subsidiary names they're all a gang on a
[45:32.880 --> 45:38.280]  team together and so forums gets up the blue blood Republicans and says Ted
[45:38.280 --> 45:43.520]  Cruz you shut up Rand Paul I got the article right here you shut up or China
[45:43.520 --> 45:48.720]  will pull the plug on us this is globalism this is just how China was
[45:48.720 --> 45:52.720]  dominated with debts 150 years ago by the West and broken up into 10 parts
[45:52.720 --> 45:56.760]  this is what's happened to America this is what the IMF and the World Bank does
[45:56.760 --> 46:02.200]  to everybody but look at Greenland look at Iceland Iceland said we don't owe
[46:02.200 --> 46:06.480]  these billions of dollars it turns out 90 plus percent of it just like in the
[46:06.480 --> 46:11.000]  other countries is is foreign debt that you had our ministers signed on to we're
[46:11.000 --> 46:16.080]  gonna arrest the ministers for fraud and it turned out the debt wasn't theirs
[46:16.080 --> 46:21.640]  they created the derivatives no one's even using them as a ball and chain to
[46:21.640 --> 46:28.120]  tie us to and throw us like Jimmy Hoffa into the Atlantic Ocean do you
[46:28.120 --> 46:33.880]  understand that folks it's it's they're not stealing all the money because they
[46:33.880 --> 46:37.440]  want it they've got unlimited money they control the issuance of it they're
[46:37.440 --> 46:42.080]  created a black hole of impossible debt to tie you to it so they can hold you
[46:42.080 --> 46:46.280]  hostage anytime they want and say give us control of health care give us 47
[46:46.280 --> 46:51.040]  trillion let us do whatever we want launch a war against this country give
[46:51.040 --> 46:55.600]  us a hundred trillion in new taxes new credit to the private IMF World Bank
[46:55.600 --> 47:00.320]  that's Davos three years ago pull that up folks Davos calls for a hundred
[47:00.320 --> 47:05.920]  trillion in new credit to them your money give us full control of everything
[47:05.920 --> 47:12.240]  or we'll hammer you that's what the IMF World Bank told Spain told Greece told
[47:12.240 --> 47:17.040]  Brazil told over a hundred of the third world countries told India old world
[47:17.040 --> 47:19.680]  countries they turned into third world countries
[47:19.680 --> 47:25.720]  Spain's now at 100% GDP on their debt we're almost there that's the goal is
[47:25.720 --> 47:30.320]  to maneuver us into bankruptcy while saying get let us maneuver you into it
[47:30.320 --> 47:34.800]  or we'll drop the hammer on you these are financial terrorists that isn't
[47:34.800 --> 47:41.160]  rhetoric they are terrorists they run the physical terrorist there it is the
[47:41.160 --> 47:45.000]  world economic forum says we need a hundred trillion more credit click on
[47:45.000 --> 47:51.040]  the telegraph link right there the blue link right there that's a blue link
[47:51.040 --> 47:54.520]  right there yeah I'm gonna show folks that I want to see the one telegraph
[47:54.520 --> 47:59.640]  headline so it's in their face and so they see it and so they understand it
[47:59.640 --> 48:09.320]  and so they know it all right now they are maneuvering us into this while
[48:09.320 --> 48:12.640]  dangling to people oh you don't have jobs you don't have industry you can work
[48:12.640 --> 48:16.120]  $8 an hour McDonald's but you'll get free healthcare under Obama's you're
[48:16.120 --> 48:22.480]  like well I want to believe in that when it's a total con game and so here is
[48:22.480 --> 48:27.400]  the 64 trillion dollar point you've got to realize that the enemy is the
[48:27.400 --> 48:32.080]  globalist they've occupied the country Brazil figured this out 10 years ago
[48:32.080 --> 48:35.920]  through the IMF World Bank out and it's now the success story compared to what
[48:35.920 --> 48:40.480]  they were there's a few other countries have thrown them out like Iceland
[48:40.480 --> 48:43.840]  Greece didn't do it let me show you some headlines here if you're a TV viewer
[48:43.840 --> 48:47.600]  if Republicans want to shut down Washington they'll have to ask China's
[48:47.600 --> 48:52.840]  permission first Forbes and it goes on to brag that China runs America now you
[48:52.840 --> 48:56.280]  mean the Communist Chinese we are literally run by the Communist Chinese
[48:56.280 --> 49:00.040]  with the private Federal Reserve Goldman Sachs think of these traders who
[49:00.040 --> 49:05.920]  maneuvered this through fraud it's illegitimate we don't owe it it's bull and
[49:05.920 --> 49:10.080]  they're gonna implode us anyways but slowly they want to quietly with a pillow
[49:10.080 --> 49:13.840]  we never wake up kill us instead of have a stand-up fight with these people now
[49:13.840 --> 49:17.000]  you want to just call their bluff and say go ahead and plunge things we're
[49:17.000 --> 49:21.000]  gonna arrest all of you oh they may kill me for stuff like this folks this is the
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.240]  type of leadership that'll bring them down it doesn't matter but frankly if
[49:24.240 --> 49:27.440]  they kill me it'll only make this info bigger that's why they haven't they'll
[49:27.440 --> 49:30.840]  kill a million Iraqis for fun folks you think they won't kill me they won't kill
[49:30.840 --> 49:35.920]  me because what I've said is so on target 100% it blows their death star
[49:35.920 --> 49:41.000]  sky high if you simply use it and are aware of it it's over for them the
[49:41.000 --> 49:47.000]  minute you understand this let me give you some more out here look at this right
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.600]  here and again it isn't just like their boss hog they want to wreck everything
[49:50.600 --> 49:54.360]  they're not just conquerors they were just conquerors I wouldn't risk my life
[49:54.360 --> 49:57.560]  I would criticize them but I wouldn't go all out against them they're not
[49:57.560 --> 50:03.040]  giving us quarter folks they're not gonna quit look at this with 11th hour
[50:03.040 --> 50:07.880]  bill keep the lights on futures tumbles ahead of US government shutdown OC
[50:07.880 --> 50:12.280]  they're holding OC we didn't do what the bankers wanted oh the futures are
[50:12.280 --> 50:16.320]  tumbling the stock market's tumbling told you this was coming this is how they
[50:16.320 --> 50:20.240]  hold us hostage look at this US stock futures sink on shutdown fears market
[50:20.240 --> 50:24.960]  watch and then the media the controlled media will say the state-run media oh
[50:24.960 --> 50:27.880]  it's your fault just like in LA and they'll just keep doing this like they've
[50:27.880 --> 50:32.400]  done Greece everybody else because no one figures it out no one says no no one
[50:32.400 --> 50:37.680]  gets it IMF admits mistakes on Greece bailout they said they didn't know it
[50:37.680 --> 50:41.880]  would destroy their economy five times worse oh they didn't know it's their
[50:41.880 --> 50:46.120]  program their own documents are public they do this on purpose they know
[50:46.120 --> 50:50.240]  Obamacare is gonna shut down the economy and blow the engine they know all that
[50:50.240 --> 50:54.600]  they know harassing factories all over the country is gonna shut us down that's
[50:54.600 --> 51:01.400]  the plan these are criminals they're blowing out our engine my friends Alex

[54:16.320 --> 54:22.200]  by the way this global plan has been public for about a hundred years I've
[54:22.200 --> 54:30.160]  read the New York Times from 1920s and even before bragging about the plan of
[54:30.160 --> 54:35.000]  the robber barons to internationally create a private corporate government
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.920]  above the law to dominate the nation states and the populations it's
[54:38.920 --> 54:43.960]  empire by stealth it's basically the British government British Empire
[54:43.960 --> 54:50.040]  model but it's a corporate system and I know you know that but we have to get
[54:50.040 --> 54:55.040]  the word out to everyone about this remember how they gave the communist
[54:55.040 --> 55:02.480]  Chinese the Panama Canal in an agreement in 1979 the transfer became official in
[55:02.480 --> 55:09.080]  1999 remember how they gave all the deep water ports now in the Caribbean the
[55:09.080 --> 55:14.280]  Pacific to the communist Chinese the giant mega port built on the Pacific
[55:14.280 --> 55:20.760]  side of Mexico communist Chinese government run that's because the
[55:20.760 --> 55:25.440]  globalist have made the deal because China had a billion plus slaves that's
[55:25.440 --> 55:30.440]  how the globalists see these poor souls because they'll put people on drugs and
[55:30.440 --> 55:36.840]  forced abortions in Foxconn labs and have suicide nets and if you criticize
[55:36.840 --> 55:41.880]  the government the police in China cut your genitals off in public I'm not
[55:41.880 --> 55:46.000]  kidding that's on record look it up they have more than 14 suicide vans going
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.280]  24 hours a day in each major city in China
[55:51.800 --> 55:58.000]  when I call it suicide vans I mean I'm getting some audio through here guys
[55:58.000 --> 56:02.200]  through a computer that's what distracted me I'm getting audio pumping
[56:02.200 --> 56:06.720]  through the wall over there I don't I don't know what it is but we'll find out
[56:06.720 --> 56:16.040]  pardon me yeah it must be my computer what an incredible what an incredible
[56:16.040 --> 56:20.560]  distraction for the show they have mobile execution vans just type in mobile
[56:20.560 --> 56:27.040]  execution vans if you want to see that and understand that now continuing here
[56:27.040 --> 56:33.080]  ladies and gentlemen this is the authoritarian system that that this
[56:33.080 --> 56:37.720]  that the power structure has made a deal with to leverage out the rest of the
[56:37.720 --> 56:49.040]  world and China's only one small part of it but they come out in the news and say
[56:49.040 --> 56:52.280]  if you don't do what we want we're going to implode the economy it's your fault
[56:52.280 --> 56:55.800]  and then they hold us hostage and that's how they've done it to Greece three
[56:55.800 --> 57:00.200]  times the last four years it's how they've done it to Spain it's how they've
[57:00.200 --> 57:05.080]  done it to everyone while they give the infrastructure that America built just
[57:05.080 --> 57:09.720]  like the 20 plus billion that went to General Motors as the bailout and then
[57:09.720 --> 57:14.920]  what was their recovery plan moved to Eastern Europe China and Brazil now
[57:14.920 --> 57:23.920]  continuing here ladies and gentlemen look at how the IMF tells the BBC oh we
[57:23.920 --> 57:27.920]  didn't know raising taxes that much would stall the economy and hurt them oh we
[57:27.920 --> 57:32.440]  didn't mean to make things worse when that's always their plan IMF admits it
[57:32.440 --> 57:36.480]  misjudged the impact of austerity on Greece but the answer they want now is
[57:36.480 --> 57:43.040]  even more oh how sweet it's always a mistake when they wreck the country
[57:43.040 --> 57:48.080]  Greece may face a gap of 11 billion euros IMF says but don't worry they'll
[57:48.080 --> 57:52.880]  just tax the middle class more look at this Spain's public debt to approach 100
[57:52.880 --> 58:01.400]  percent of GDP by next year isn't that sweet 100 percent of their GDP is debt
[58:01.400 --> 58:05.600]  and then it turns out most of it 80 plus percent in Spain they do have big
[58:05.600 --> 58:11.040]  public debt 80 plus percent of it is banker derivatives where their private
[58:11.040 --> 58:15.520]  central banks sign them on to the bankers debt they sign you on to a debt and
[58:15.520 --> 58:19.960]  then tell you that you're their slave not to just get money but to destroy you
[58:19.960 --> 58:25.160]  politically and make you dependent so this is what's happening and then
[58:25.160 --> 58:28.360]  there's turmoil in the country's they call that the IMF riot and then they
[58:28.360 --> 58:31.400]  come in and set up a police state on the backs of that and this is what they're
[58:31.400 --> 58:35.800]  getting ready to do big time here in America while posing as the saviors
[58:35.800 --> 58:41.720]  America is occupied by foreign banks backed by the communist Chinese
[58:42.240 --> 58:46.040]  second hour coming up tell everybody you know to tune in this is absolutely key
[58:46.040 --> 58:54.160]  radio network the world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight
[58:54.160 --> 58:59.080]  against life-threatening pathogens and as a result dozens of silver solutions
[58:59.080 --> 59:02.640]  have emerged you can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your

[59:07.400 --> 59:11.880]  natural silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000
[59:11.880 --> 59:16.520]  volts of AC current this technology is so powerful it must be made in a
[59:16.520 --> 59:21.840]  laboratory colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC
[59:21.840 --> 59:26.360]  current making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against

[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:19.680]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.160]  Alex Jones
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:32.480]  by the way I've been talking in the last hour how we've been occupied by the
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:38.080]  private banks that created the IMF the World Bank the UN and how they maneuver
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:41.960]  every country towards total bankruptcy to consolidate and take control of the
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:46.440]  nation their philosophy is eugenics look at Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Bank of
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:53.920]  America they fund all the fake green groups all the anti family groups this
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:01:01.800]  is the program this is the takeover this is the plan and then what the IMF and
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:06.080]  World Bank do on record is they take millions of US dollars or euros and
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:11.680]  loan them at loan sharking rakes of the third world and tell them here's where
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:17.320]  you've got to spend your money and it's with globalist corporations who then
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:21.440]  make sure the public never gets any of the wealth they don't want any wealth
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:26.160]  they don't want a wealth-driven economy they don't want prosperity the
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:32.440]  Federal Reserve always says we don't want to overheat the economy that means
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.320]  they don't want you to get too much wealth they don't want to create new
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:39.200]  waves of middle-class the historic enemy of the robber barons and look
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.840]  everybody already knows all this everybody knows that Russia when the
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:46.840]  Soviet Union fell the very same banksters that had helped put in the
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:53.440]  communists 80 years before or 70 years before that the very same globalist then
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.800]  took over that economy through the IMF and World Bank and looted it but the
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.360]  Russians got wise to what was happening and kept the globalist out now just a
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:09.440]  new group of kleptocrats are in charge but they want actual prosperity because
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.360]  they understand that's more to skim off a prosperous group they're not as
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:18.080]  anti-human as the globalist and so that's what's going on in Russia right
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:21.640]  now and that's why it's the arch enemy of the banksters it's not that I side
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:26.520]  with Russia it's that I side against the globalist occupying anybody whether
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:31.120]  it's Russia whether it's Syria whether it's our Republic it doesn't matter
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:37.040]  that's what's happening and that's the big news info wars is able to force
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:43.000]  stuff into the dominant press which is alternative and mainstream we're able to
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.680]  break major news and we have all the facts in front of us of the IMF World
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:51.880]  Bank takeover plan of the Joseph Stickles documents that were leaked 11
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:56.320]  years ago detailing all this we've been warning people now we're here we saw a
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.800]  big round of this in 2008 now we're seeing another round of it and that's
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.760]  what Obamacare is is a tax to foreign offshore banks that's the talking
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:09.560]  point the truth Obamacare is a tax to foreign offshore banks that own the
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:13.880]  insurance companies the insurance companies wrote the bill the blue
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:18.560]  bloods at Forbes love looting economies they're supporting it they're saying
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.440]  that's communist Chinese run America they own our debt our Congress isn't
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:27.200]  allowed to not do this and they're gonna drop the stock market as we told you
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.680]  it's happening they're gonna drop the futures market they're gonna hold a
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:35.680]  sausage and say you let Obamacare happen we don't care if your bill funds the
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:41.440]  rest of government or we're gonna shut everything off and we're like really and

[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:10.560]  figured that out in the last five years that most the smart monies on they're
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:14.120]  gonna fail at least partially that's why the big money's been running to armoured
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:17.800]  redoubts in the middle of nowhere they've been running to the places like
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:21.280]  Romania they've been running to places like Hungary they've been running to the
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:25.560]  Transylvanian Mountains I'm not making this up they have been running and

[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.240]  moment speaking of things that are very very serious if you go up to my Twitter
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:44.160]  real Alex Jones I tweeted this out on Saturday because it's so important Yale
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:49.520]  professor Fukushima will threaten humanity for thousands of years a Yale
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:54.640]  professor and many other top radiologist and physicist are cautioning the world
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.600]  to wake up from its nuclear slumber and face the severity of the Fukushima
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:02.400]  radiation crisis warning that all of humanity will be threatened for thousands
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.720]  of years if the Fukushima unit four pool is not kept cool which they're
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:10.440]  having trouble doing they're storing all this radioactive waste that is
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:17.000]  basically were set to start exploding again or set on fire and the background
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.800]  radiation since the 40s is double the northern hemisphere it's almost gone up
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:26.120]  another level to a tripling so it's almost triple and folks ask what do you
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:28.960]  do well you can't move to the southern hemisphere I guess you could you're
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:35.040]  retired the answer is take nation iodine this is special iodine folks I did
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:40.000]  research for myself and my family and with the medical doctors and the
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.480]  scientists and the nutritionists they kept saying look seaweeds great and the
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:48.160]  modifier one wonderful from the southern hemisphere other things are
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:53.960]  wonderful but we sell that in foreshore calm but it's nascent iodine in the
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:57.680]  entire metabolic system of the body this is the atomic iodine doesn't mean it
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:01.480]  has anything radioactive and it's just called atomic because it's the it's the
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:05.920]  pure iodine not the toxic stuff that sold the store not the rad pills the
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:10.160]  government pushes which is good in a radiological event but but for every day
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:18.200]  used for overall health just across the board ladies and gentlemen survival
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:22.720]  shield from info wars life calm the first in a long line of products that
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:28.160]  we're developing with dr. Edward group and others a simply amazing I've been
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:31.640]  taking it for over a month and a half my wife is marveling at it I'm sure everyone
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:36.680]  can look at me and and see I've lost more weight again I'm eating more and
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:39.400]  taking this and losing weight now that's how it works for me and that's what
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:42.880]  dr. group said it does for people because the thyroids regulating the other
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:46.440]  hormones and the other stuff the body can't break down the chemical stuff
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:50.120]  that they sell the stores and even health with stores this is very hard to
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:56.480]  get this is the raw nuclear iodine you have to be DEA approved at the plant to
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:00.160]  even buy this stuff by the way when they bought a bunch and made it for us the
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:05.240]  DEA did this it the point is is that that's how good it is for your body and
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:09.040]  of course the drug dealers needed is one of the precursors the point is is that
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:15.280]  this is so good for your body ladies and gentlemen and we sold out of all of it
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:18.920]  except about a thousand bottles and it'll be about two weeks till we get more
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:23.480]  but after those are sold you can still order it'll be a two week back order
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:28.000]  maybe a week back order we're not sure the point is is that it's available at
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:34.080]  infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com but the future infowarslife.com will be the
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:37.520]  main site with all of it and if you go to that address it takes you there you
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:44.160]  can also call the toll free number 888-253-3139 we bought enough iodine we
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:47.240]  thought the last is two months so I'm like wow this stuff's so incredible I
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.960]  need to come out with it because that's what I'm moving into is doing that so I
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:56.760]  can assure it's the the very best so again infowarslife.com survival shield
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:02.440]  nascent iodine dietary supplement available at infowarslife.com or
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:11.200]  call toll 3-888-253-3139 and again you'll still be able to continue to order it
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:14.600]  after it's sold out we'll just have a notice there that to expect you know two
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:18.000]  weeks until we're able to ship it out so three weeks probably after these are
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.400]  sold out infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 and this isn't just something for your
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:28.440]  emergency area this is something that I personally and you go do your own
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:31.920]  research on it but I personally have found is the is the thing hiding in
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:37.000]  plain view but not regular iodine and of course consult your physician before
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.320]  you use it especially if you're nursing or oh I guess if you're nursing I I mean
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:45.720]  if you're if you're a mother who has a nursing child or if you're pregnant and
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:52.520]  things like that infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 all right shifting gears
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:56.880]  here folks Geraldo Rivera is coming up sometime in the third hour for the next
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:00.480]  45 minutes or so we're joined by Dr. Jerome Corsi and before we get into
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:04.840]  his new book I want to talk about Obamacare the government shut down the
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:08.960]  incredible betrayal does he agree with Mitch McConnell that let it go ahead and
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:13.120]  go through now we try to stop it it's so horrible it'll discredit collectivist
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:17.280]  forever my point is it'll shut the economy down and they'll just use some
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:20.200]  other government shut down to blame the implosion of the economy and blame it
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:24.160]  on libertarians and conservatives plus it's immoral to let it kind of be a
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.440]  false flag where we let them do it to discredit them because they've done this
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.640]  everywhere else they're gonna pose and claim libertarians and Republicans
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:36.360]  blocked it and then it never got implemented right and then fully
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:40.360]  socialize healthcare so I say do the right thing justice be done may the
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:43.800]  heavens fall but separately and I just spent the last hour on this but I
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:48.400]  believe is the key to all this and what other courses take on this first just as
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:52.080]  during October of 2008 we saw the offshore banks the Federal Reserve hold
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:55.760]  his hostage to get tens of trillions of dollars in banker bailout money or they
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.800]  would implode the economy as Henry Paulson threatened the Congress he
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:02.680]  said blood in the streets tanks of the streets well now the bullets and the
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:06.760]  tanks are actually delivered and Al Qaeda is not the threat we're told it's
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:11.280]  conservatives libertarians gun owners in the Fedders people like Dr. Corsi
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:16.960]  myself worldnetdaily.com info wars.com drudgereport.com Ron Paul we're the
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:19.960]  ones in the Southern Prairie Law Center reports we're the ones being lied about
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:24.680]  we're the ones MSNBC says is racist with no no proof you know if I say
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:29.280]  somebody's a racist I'm gonna show the clip they are coming after us because we
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:34.240]  know it's a globalist takeover we're occupied captured by the globalist just
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:40.000]  as Greece is just as Iceland was just as Spain was and they always say give us
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.880]  this new tax whether it's the bailout or or Obamacare this attacks the foreign
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:48.600]  banks and Corsi can talk about this he worked at the highest levels of
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:53.320]  international banking you know as a Harvard economist basically I want to
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:57.840]  get his take on this because I believe I know if we get the truth out to people
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:04.400]  with articles like this one out of Bloomberg where they're so arrogant
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:09.760]  they come out and say and there's another one here in Forbes you got to ask
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:13.720]  the Communist Chinese if you could have a government shutdown and they brag
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:18.320]  checkmate America's occupied by financial and foreign interest just like a
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:23.160]  third-world country under gunboat diplomacy so if we point out that the
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:27.000]  Panama Canal all our infrastructure general motors everything's being
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.480]  transferred to China in a dirty trick by the globalist who need a home and that
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:38.240]  and that you know Maury strong and all of them live over there now if we point
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:41.480]  out this double cross with the IMF the World Bank the Saudi Arabians the
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:45.280]  Communist Chinese who already dictate what movies we can put out just like the
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:48.480]  Saudi Arabians I don't like Israel dictating some of what we do I'm not
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:51.600]  defending Israel but the point is no one ever talks about the chai comms of the
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:56.360]  or the or the Saudis and they're the ones always giving me problems they're
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:17:01.880]  the ones always coming coming down on me folks okay they're the ones who are
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:06.880]  teamed up with the big banks and these other globalist and European interest
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.560]  and it's a bunch of criminals over all these countries teamed up doing it so
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.720]  we're gonna skip this network break this is so important to give Dr. Corsi more
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:19.960]  time but my point is if we point out Obamacare is a shutdown of America it's
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:24.520]  the free market shutdown there is no shutdown of the abominable occupied
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:28.000]  federal government they're not even shutting down all the core stuff it is
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.040]  literally a way to make you think that you only survive because of them and it
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.880]  makes them the center of attention and this is how they've taken over Brazil
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:41.080]  Nigeria Greece and notice when Greece gave them the all the money they wanted
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:46.000]  they imploded more notice when when France did this they imploded more notice
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.680]  when Spain did it they imploded more and now the bankers are going to do it to
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:54.480]  the Western world this is so historical and I wanted Dr. Corsi's take on that
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:18:00.360]  and where he sees us historically because I see an awakening but at the same
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:04.800]  time if we don't explain to people that this is a globalist takeover a war
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:08.520]  against sovereign nations and individual wealth and private property if we don't
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:12.840]  point that out to everyone and point out that Obamacare is a takeover of
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:17.040]  America and is designed to wreck us and drive us into the welfare roles as they
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:22.840]  make tens of millions go on part-time the employer mandate 63 percent of
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:26.920]  doctors say they're going to retire early my dad is I mean it is my dad was
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:30.520]  working under ten years he loves being a physician everybody he knows is getting
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:35.040]  ready to retire that's the plan so so that's a lot I just said Dr. Corsi some
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:38.960]  stations like XM only join us the last two hours I wanted to recap where we're
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:43.760]  at you've heard the compendium of what I've said I mean I know you're gonna
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:46.040]  agree with me because I've read your writings and your research this is a
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:50.160]  fact but you and I know this we need the public to know this and then get
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.880]  adopted everybody else because from a from a military and historic and
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:58.160]  political perspective when we phrase this right that it's a foreign occupation
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:03.040]  which it is by suits and you in bureaucrats above the law backed up by
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:07.360]  the chai comms it's over we've got to get that message out that they're holding
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:11.760]  us hostage to implode us not holding us hostage to fix the economy and the only
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:16.800]  way out is to run up the flag of you know the black flag of no surrender and
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:22.560]  charge you know damn the maneuvers go straight at him dr. Corsi well I agree
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:28.320]  with you Alex I think we're at a critical point here with the shutdown I
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:33.400]  mean if the obama care goes into effect it is clearly going to wreck the
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:37.360]  economy it's clearly designed to wreck the economy that's what people don't
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:41.480]  understand this is a the democrats had planned this from the beginning to
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:45.680]  destroy the economy and by the way most of the Republicans went along with it
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:50.680]  now what's happened as it gets closer to implementation and people are
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:56.360]  realizing how disastrous obama care is I mean we list the disasters it's making
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:02.400]  America part-time employed it's going to have death panels I mean I'm I began to
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:08.560]  call it obama side as in homicide I mean the quality of medical care is going to
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:15.200]  deteriorate rapidly the the the powers that be the elite know this it's not
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:20.920]  designed to give universal medical care there's going to be as many uninsured
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:25.800]  under this bill as there were before it's just going to deteriorate the
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:30.720]  quality of health care and put it under government control so I agree with you
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:35.560]  the only thing to do at this point is to fight it not to agree with it that's
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:39.820]  why SMY has a nightly show devoted entirely to New York sports because who
[01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:42.960]  cares about coverage from Orange County when you hey doc I think something
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:48.400]  launched on your computer I had that happen earlier to me I'll go ahead you're
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:54.400]  back sir I'm back okay a place continue the only thing to do is only do is to
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:21:01.320]  fight this and to let the government shut down the idea of and last minute
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:06.400]  fix or the I mean it's a game of chicken at this point the president thinks that
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:12.320]  he'll get his way by refusing to negotiate with the Republicans finally I
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:16.760]  think the Tea Party conservatives have gotten through to the Republicans in the
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:21.200]  House that they're gonna lose their seats they're gonna be voted against it's
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:27.160]  suicide to vote for Obamacare even John Boehner and Mitch Cantor finally got the
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:31.880]  message so a showdown now is inevitable and I think a showdown is the only
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:37.000]  possible thing that might save the country from Obamacare what Obama's
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.720]  counting on is that the Republicans will lose their nerve and that he can beat
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:45.920]  the drums with the mainstream media causing panic that the government's
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:49.800]  shutting down the truth is if the government shuts down most Americans
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:55.840]  won't feel it at all and at most it's gonna be a minor inconvenience although
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:00.720]  I'm sure the Obama people will try to make it as painful as possible delays at
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:06.600]  airports other closings of public parks etc but I think America's gonna feel
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:11.680]  after a short period of time that it's better to suffer this inconvenience and
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:17.040]  to fight a fight now against Obamacare because if Obamacare gets funded at this
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:24.440]  point the possibility of repealing it at a later point is uncertain and if the
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:29.440]  the force is the one Obamacare in power and it's not just Democrats Democrats
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:33.480]  Republicans I think it's the bankers it's those who want to control the
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:38.920]  American economy if they win at this point if Obamacare gets funded and they
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:44.040]  get through this hurdle don't count on having another chance to repeal it and
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:51.400]  of course this is a cloward and Piven 101 here Dr. Corsi explain to people what
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:55.640]  cloward and Piven is well card is there were two sociologists who were at
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:23:01.840]  Columbia when Obama was supposedly there and their whole idea was to create a
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:06.920]  communist state in which we would move to eliminate private property go to a
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:13.880]  collectivism of a Soviet style government only by collapsing capitalism
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:19.080]  and their whole idea cloud and Piven a collapsing capitalism was to so pile the
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:25.160]  demands on a social welfare system that eventually the system went bankrupt and
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:30.280]  we're right at that point right now but we can't really absorb the costs of
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:36.360]  Obamacare you're gonna find again Obamacare is a tax that's another thing I
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:41.200]  think you all got to really understand this is a tax and it's designed to be
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:46.600]  punitive you're gonna find young people who are looking at you know $300 a
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:50.880]  month if they want to get insured under Obamacare when they don't need to have
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:54.760]  this kind of insurance at this point in their lives you're not gonna find more
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:58.320]  people being insured it's not gonna happen you're gonna find doctors who
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:03.880]  want to leave the health care exchanges aren't gonna work the only people are
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:08.040]  gonna go to the exchanges are sick and they're gonna look for insurance that
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:12.160]  they couldn't otherwise get which by the way will bankrupt the insurance
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:17.200]  companies who participate this thing is a disaster in every scope but people got
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:22.840]  understand it was meant to be a disaster the whole purpose of Obamacare was to
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:27.840]  implode the American health system and that's right and Obama as you know
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:32.000]  earlier this year hired the head French economist that helped destroy their
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.240]  economy and bring 100 plus percent taxes on the middle class to collectivize
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:40.960]  everyone because the top socialists had all turned out had Swiss bank accounts
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:44.280]  and were above the law and they didn't even get in trouble this is an
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:48.920]  authoritarian takeover they've doubled the number of people on food stamps it's
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:53.200]  set to double again the next five years this has been Obama has been
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:58.600]  incredibly successful he has devastated with the globalists in the big banks the
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:02.760]  country and the country's on live support right now and Obamacare is the
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:08.240]  lethal injection and notice that members of Congress are exempted and their
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:12.400]  staffs exempted from Obamacare that should tell everybody something and
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:17.360]  even in this shutdown guess who's gonna get paid members of Congress and their
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:23.320]  staff so you know the the pain being inflicted by Obamacare is on the
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:28.880]  American people and the goal is to destroy the middle class and if we just
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:33.480]  take a perspective it used to be that everybody got health insurance who was
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:37.840]  employed you got as part of your employment package today we deteriorated
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:42.120]  the system so far that not only are you not getting health insurance where you
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:48.000]  work your work is being turned into part-time labor so you can avoid having
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.240]  to have the health insurance paid by the employer and the whole structure is
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:58.560]  designed to be a warfare against employment pushing more and more people
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:02.000]  into the hands of government dependency more and more people in the hands of
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.280]  food stamp and other forms of government checks and the government's now
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:09.840]  going to try to you know the Obama's administration is going to try to scare
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:13.640]  everybody but if they don't if we don't allow the federal government to continue
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:19.320]  operating it's huge bloated structure disaster is going to occur I remind
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:23.280]  everybody that when the sequester hit there wasn't any disaster and there
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:27.480]  won't be any disaster in the government shut down sure dr. Corsi let me throw
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:30.480]  this out there at you the weekly standard pointed out something we've
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:35.480]  pointed out before Obamacare website quietly deleted references to free
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:39.480]  healthcare they done this in emails they were sending out a few months ago but
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:45.320]  now it's off the site before it said where can I get free or low-cost care in
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:50.200]  my community now it says where can I get low-cost care in my community what
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:53.840]  about what Mitch McConnell says that oh let's let it go through it so horrible
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:58.360]  to destroy them no I mean their constituents God bless them are so
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:03.600]  gullible and uninformed that they're gonna end up blaming those of us I mean
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:08.320]  you don't let a train wreck happen so you can blame it on the other side you
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:11.520]  try to prevent you try to prevent the train wreck from happening it's
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:18.200]  unpredictable if Obamacare fails there the opponents of Obamacare just gonna
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:23.600]  get blamed anyway we'll be blamed I'll be blamed you'll be blamed because we
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:28.800]  opposed it we criticized it you Mitch McConnell is wrong the only thing to do
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:33.320]  right now is to take a principal stand on this and draw a line and tell the
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:37.960]  international bankers tell the federal government we're tired of it go back let's
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:43.200]  go back to the printing our own money get rid of the Federal Reserve a crisis
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.960]  is coming there's no doubt that the this whole system of death is going to
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:53.400]  implode that implodes it'll implode the minute the Federal Reserve stops buying
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:57.440]  our own death and there's a point at which we can't continue buying our own
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:00.680]  debt and the government knows and instead of them holding us hostage and
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:04.440]  maneuvering us into a thing where they're in control when they pull the plug
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:07.920]  either way they're the authors of the whole thing they're the ones that get
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:12.360]  in trouble not capitalism and free market and those of us that warned like
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:18.000]  you and Ron Paul for 35 years we should get medals not be blamed for it so we
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.320]  better explain all this right now so they get the blame and we don't get
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:30.080]  basically scapegoated and also you know look that the forces that be the
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:34.640]  bankers the insurance companies the insurance companies want this by the
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:40.760]  way they funded Democrats very heavily on this Obama wants us desperately let's
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:44.840]  not let them have it let's destroy if they if the follow you know the New
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:50.400]  World Order forces want Obamacare so badly that alone is a sign it ought to
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:56.600]  be destroyed because you know its intention is more control more serfdom
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:01.680]  more destruction of the private economy a less income and less control for
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:05.160]  people in their own hands and forcing everything into a government health
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:10.960]  system it we've got to draw a line and if it's at all possible to destroy
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:15.720]  Obamacare now let's do that and by the way I shut down on the government I
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:20.600]  think it would I'd love to see people understand after three weeks six weeks
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:25.800]  two months that we don't need this much government anyway why not shut it down
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:29.480]  why don't shut my massive portions of it down permanently exactly we should
[01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:34.080]  send the House Republicans that are doing a good job I'll thank you notes
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:38.840]  here I mean I can't wait to have the feds off my back I wish they'd all go to

[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:23.240]  this transmission you are the resistance
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:30.640]  my friends if you've read the road to surfstone written decades ago if you've
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:35.840]  studied history the reason I get angry and and start almost hyperventilating on
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:41.040]  air is the IMF and World Bank are on record going in and giving loans to
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:46.480]  third-world countries at loan sharking rates and in internal agreements they
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:50.160]  only get it so the country has to agree that they won't pay it back and then a
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:54.400]  piece is given to the dictator or given to the corrupt Congress or the corrupt
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:34:00.880]  parliament and a billion dollar loan in Nigeria becomes 40 plus billion in debt
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:07.960]  you pay 40 billion over the years on a billion dollar loan and they gave terms
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:12.400]  to Greece and others that they knew would hammer the economy Joseph Stiklitz
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:17.720]  left as the chief economist the World Bank in 2002 and 2000 pages of documents
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:22.840]  got leaked to Joseph Stiklitz they declared national security on them but
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:29.680]  not before he put out a hundred plus pages on my show the BBC News Night put
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:36.360]  it out he was on my show the same day the same day he said I can come on your
[01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:41.240]  show once it airs it was airing over in England six hours ahead a tape of it you
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:48.600]  know that he'd shot the equivalent of Nightline Greg Palast while he was on my
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:53.360]  show live breaking it in 2002 where they plan to do this to America that's the
[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:58.120]  thing these are criminals they are the ones that lobby for welfare and
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:04.080]  socialism so they always have a kept group that will riot they call the IMF
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:09.240]  riot they have all these actuary battle plans we always knew this but it leaked
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:12.720]  and Stiklitz when he's come on the show probably five times always says I did not
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:17.400]  leak that by the way do not say I leaked that okay it just got leaked the same
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:21.880]  time you quit and went public about it but I do admire Stiklitz he's done over
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:26.280]  some of his politics because he honorably you know quit this is the most
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:30.800]  immoral thing you can do just like carbon taxes double on the third world
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:34.400]  with kill a billion people in a decade Lord Monkton's numbers show and his
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:39.560]  numbers are dead on this is eugenics this is command and control all of our
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:43.760]  ancestors one way or another came here from Europe if you come from Europe or
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:47.120]  even other nations after that in the second and third waves because you
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:51.000]  weren't allowed to be a doctor if your family wasn't doctors you weren't
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.680]  allowed to own land if your family didn't own lands you weren't allowed to
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:57.720]  even be a blacksmith if your family wasn't a blacksmith you were kept where
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:02.200]  you were and what do you think Mexico's gone from 10 million people to 30
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:07.000]  million in the last 20 years they turned all of southern and central Mexico
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:14.400]  west and east and into UN biospheres my dad the 80s looked at buying land down
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.280]  there when I'd never heard a biosphere went down to Mexico and looked at rich
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:21.760]  Europeans Americans and Mexicans buying Mayans land that they've been on for
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:24.320]  thousands of years and you're only allowed to build certain things on it
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:28.320]  and there were UN signs UN brochures and my dad said I don't want to buy land
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:32.280]  I remember my mom my dad in Cancun after we driven out and I'm going back to Dr.
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:38.080]  Corsi after we driven back from the middle of nowhere on the coast down
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:41.280]  there he said I don't know he goes I don't want to buy land they took from
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:44.720]  took from farmers and fishermen
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:49.560]  years later I go to Cozumel and other places there's no fishermen fishing
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:53.200]  they're not allowed to under it only big trawlers are allowed to come by so
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:57.800]  they've all got to move can't grow corn anymore can't fish anymore big trawlers
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:01.120]  are only allowed to get the fish because they pay the Mexican government it's
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:05.520]  all a 21 it's feudalism it's served them so they all got to go to Mexico City to
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:10.080]  be slaves to then bring down America's wages and make us slaves just like China's
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:13.440]  used as a race on the bottom that Ross Perot warned us about and Dr. Jerome
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:18.080]  Corsi amazing new book just finished it this weekend who really killed Kennedy
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:21.280]  already shooting up the New York Times bestseller list just coming out today
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:25.760]  50 years later stunning new revelations about the JFK assassination it's
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:32.840]  available at info wars store.com and the reason it's so important is that it
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:37.520]  gets into who controls it and how it was a coup over America by the very same
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:42.760]  special interests that now want a coup over any form of wealth they want you
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:47.840]  poor by design it is such a crime I love wealth I love when I see somebody
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:52.640]  successful or the beautiful wife or beautiful kids I admire them these
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:56.600]  people and the folks that serve them hate your wealth they hate your success
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:00.800]  and they're enemies of humanity folks and this is a philosophy throughout
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:05.760]  history are you for prosperity and and and and admiring the virtuous or you
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:11.280]  gang related gang mentality thug mentality organized crime mentality
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:15.320]  Dr. Corsi I'm ranting I want you to finish up on the whole banking takeover
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:19.600]  that we just mentioned and what I just talked about this radical transformation
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:23.120]  this is not rhetoric this is really happening America's going into the
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:28.240]  guillotine right now and then segue in the 25 minutes we've got left into your
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:32.560]  new book. Well it's basically the background of the book I
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:37.120]  mean I'm I point out that the Kennedy assassination which I've studied now for
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:43.960]  50 years I knew the Kennedys I was you know back with my father around he was
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:48.520]  a labor lobbyist in the 50s in Washington I go back to the McClellan
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:53.280]  committee hearings and it was a coup d'etat to kill Jack Kennedy engineered
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:59.440]  by the highest powers in America and covered up by those same powers including
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:05.240]  CIA including Lyndon Johnson in conjunction with the mob and going back
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:09.720]  to the McClellan committee hearings which was the start of Jack Kennedy's real
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:17.640]  rise to national prominence that was the hearings against the mob going into the
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:22.080]  teamsters union one of the key families I write about that people don't really
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:28.560]  know much about the Elkins crime family in the West warned Kennedy that he was
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:33.560]  going to be killed and that the assassination would occur from a plot of
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:40.680]  a high-powered rifle with a scope and a tall building on a motorcade even day
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:46.400]  Jack Kennedy awoke in Fort Worth in November 22nd 1963 he was talking about
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:51.720]  how easy it would be to kill him that day Kennedy knew an assassination attempt
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:55.720]  was in the works and he also knew it was being organized from within the
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:58.720]  government
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:04.760]  continue well the as I go the attempt to kill Jack Kennedy there were three
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:10.040]  attempts to kill Jack Kennedy in November 63 first two failed one in
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:17.760]  Chicago and one in in in Tampa Dallas succeeded and it's important that it was
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:23.400]  a secret service agent in Chicago that stopped the first one correct and he
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:29.600]  tipped off the Kennedy's highly us plot stopped because Kennedy didn't go to
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:36.800]  Chicago in a Tampa Kennedy had to go to Tampa and the security was beefed up but
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:40.000]  in Dallas they thought you know everybody trying to protect Kennedy thought
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.720]  it was raining that day which it was in Fort Worth when the day started by a
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:49.120]  time they flew the short 10-minute flight to Dallas the rain stopped and the
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:55.080]  bubble top was taken off the car which is the reason the the squad in place to
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:41:00.400]  do the assassination the shooters went ahead they didn't stand down but they
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:05.080]  you know what my book addresses is not I name the shooters I say who was there
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:09.840]  and how they got there but the critical point is the forces who put them there
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:16.240]  and I say Jack Kennedy started signing his death warrant the day fired Alan
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:24.240]  Dulles from the head of the CIA in the Bay of Pigs because Alan's also was
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:28.920]  trying to trick Jack Kennedy into using a naval airstrike from a carrier off
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:34.720]  shore in this failed CIA invasion that was not a popular popular uprising and
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:41.200]  Jack Kennedy wouldn't do it Jack Kennedy said no to the CIA fired Alan
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:46.920]  Dulles and of course I trace Alan Dulles and his brother John Foster Dulles who
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:52.920]  was Secretary of State under Eisenhower back to before the war when they were
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:57.600]  working at Harriman Brothers firm in Wall Street and they were financing
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:02.720]  Hitler so people have to understand we financed Hitler we put Hitler into place
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:09.520]  in Wall Street and also in that firm were the two patriarchs of the Bush family
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:13.920]  Prescott Bush and George Herbert Walker and they were involved in funding
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:19.800]  Hitler too the Bushes and the Dulles's were running a Nazi Bank in New York
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:25.560]  Union Bank but FDR closed down on the first days of World War two after Pearl
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:30.660]  Harbor but Dulles stayed in the game Dulles went to burn Switzerland for the
[01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:35.880]  OSS and by the way the word I've got is exactly the CIA and the people who'd been
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:40.800]  in OSS and worked with the Nazis they were the recipients of lots of the Nazi
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:45.880]  Horde that was the the wealth of Europe and that's the shadow wealth that's been
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:51.120]  funding the New World Order since then in fact in 1943 as I point this out in the
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:56.520]  book and go in detail that started in 1943 when the Nazis in the know knew that
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:01.880]  they were going to lose the war Martin Borman who was number two to Hitler with
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:06.240]  Alan Dulles took billions maybe trillions of the plundered wealth you know
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:11.080]  the the gold for the Jews of the concentration camp the bullion the stolen
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:17.240]  art the treasuries that had been looted and Alan Dulles and Martin Borman
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:23.720]  invested that money into the US stock market through agents in Switzerland a
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:30.320]  lot of our post-war boom was funded by Nazi money the other place they put it
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:35.240]  was in Argentina the the Nazis it's critical people understand the Nazis
[01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:42.160]  who escaped Germany escaped because we Alan Dulles the OSS we allowed them to
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:47.840]  escape we facilitated their escape 30,000 in one wave well and we we brought
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:53.600]  over our operation paperclip at least 20,000 I estimate scientists including
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:44:00.520]  you know people like Werner von Braun who did the v2 program he headed our
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:04.520]  intercontinental missile program and he headed our space program for the man on
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:09.320]  the moon he was building the v2 terror rocket with Jewish slave labor in the
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:15.360]  concentration camp a missile that was able to handle atomic weapons the if the
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:21.960]  Nazis ever developed one well look at Goddard look at all of them and and also
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:29.600]  the whole agency the whole Galen not Gestapo that formed a pillar of our CIA
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:35.840]  Reinhard Galen yes we took that whole organization and made it one of the
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:40.200]  cornerstones of the CIA when it was built on the Nazi foundation see what
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:46.160]  people understand I think Alex is national the new world order comes from
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:51.000]  national socialism national socialism the Nazis were a leftist party they
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:57.600]  believed in a partnership between government and business for lying wars
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:02.120]  a rearmament order to promote the economy multinational business they
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:06.240]  opposed the communists as the communists wanted to eliminate private
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:10.560]  property Nazis wanted to enhance private property they wanted to put it in the
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:16.440]  hands of an international elite that was going back for those that don't know
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:21.720]  Hitler had his own model of the UN he wanted to set up his own League of
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:26.400]  Nations and they were even planning on how to feed people food that was tainted
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:30.440]  and stuff so they would slowly die because they calculated people would
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:35.680]  resist a frontal assaults they even had a plan to depopulate the earth and the
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:40.520]  British eugenicist and other eugenicists though they funded and helped set up the
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:44.560]  Nazis for those that don't know double crossed them but then adopted their
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:48.560]  entire program the 68 gun control act is the Nazi gun control act from
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:53.040]  Nuremberg that's on record the first the first universal health care we're
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:56.920]  fighting today with a bottle of care was put in place by the Nazis the
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:46:01.480]  Olympics the modern Olympics created by Adolf Alois Hitler he drew the ring
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:06.480]  symbol the Volkswagen he designed it I mean basically when you realize that
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:12.600]  most of our world is basically Nazi but it's not saying they're Nazis it's that
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:16.840]  they took the Nazi model mixed it with the British Empire model and that's the
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:21.440]  new world order this is the new world order and it was a Nazi idea to have a
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:26.080]  new world order and the dullesses and the bushes embraced it and they brought
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:32.040]  it back and they formed it as the the cornerstone of our post-World War two
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:37.440]  you know cold war which people have got to understand also the dullesses the
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:41.360]  military when Eisenhower warned the military industrial complex these are
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:46.240]  all Nazi formulations how you know business you know what Hitler's other
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:50.920]  pamphlet books name was it was New World Order and they even had anti Nazi
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:56.840]  cartoons in World War two showing Hitler going I want my new world order right
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:04.880]  it was New World Order is a Nazi concept and Jack Kennedy would not fight these
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:11.760]  lying CIA wars he wouldn't do it Jack Kennedy also didn't put troops in the
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:18.880]  Laos the again you have the CIA with people like Lansdale the CIA wanted
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:23.320]  to develop this guerrilla army a US army that could fight in a guerrilla war
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:30.000]  asymmetric army like we have today and they wanted no bid contracts because
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:36.120]  before you know beginning of Vietnam you had before that you if we had one
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:42.080]  weapon system multiple companies build it but after Vietnam Bell build all the
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:46.400]  helicopter helicopters they got no bid contract hey let's go further you take
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:52.920]  the current head of the Senate here in Texas David Dewhurst lieutenant governor
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:59.240]  he's on record working with Klaus Barbie and the CIA in the 70s in Central and
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:03.280]  South America and he doesn't even deny it I mean that's how many of these guys
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:07.920]  there are he was trained by Klaus Barbie and for those that don't know who Klaus
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:13.000]  Barbie was he was top SS and what I put on the book is the the model for coup
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:21.200]  d'etat with a patsy and an assassination was developed in the 1950s by the CIA and
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:25.760]  they worked with Edward Bernays who I knew had a public relations there was a
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:31.320]  banana company the United Fruit Company and the head of state from Guatemala was
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:37.080]  returning land to the people so the CIA Edward Bernays Eisenhower decided they
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:42.000]  would have a coup d'etat they created one of these false flag bogus armies that
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.640]  they invaded Columbia with CIA mercenaries called it freedom fighters
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:50.960]  they deposed the head of state they got a new head of state they didn't like they
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:55.320]  killed them they assassinated them it was a palace guard that supposedly shot
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:59.880]  this our moss they had a state nobody saw him do it and they said well our moss
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:07.160]  took the rifle and killed himself so he had the patsy dead nobody to be blamed
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:15.000]  a coup d'etat engineered by the CIA and that model was the model that Dulles and
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:22.120]  the CIA used to put Lyndon Johnson in the White House with the complicity of the
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:25.240]  mob incredible book all documented I've read it reading and I already know
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:28.720]  everything in it but the way you put it together is so historical I'll guarantee
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:32.280]  you most people out there do not know 10% of what's in this book and when I
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:35.600]  brag and say I know it's all accurate it's that I've done deep research for
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:39.800]  this from like 50 books this is all in one place it confirms what you've been
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:45.160]  saying this is the you know Alex it confirms what I wrote in who really
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:51.040]  killed Kennedy but that whole argument is the basic origin of the new world
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:55.240]  or this is the this is the book finally one that isn't just about Kennedy being
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:59.160]  killed but ties into why they did it who they are and let's go further you know
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:02.440]  about the Vici French the two-year infiltration by the Nazis how the
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:06.280]  French really stood down the Maginot line that's how Hitler was able to take
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:10.920]  over France and only force out the Dunkirk expeditionary force the British
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:15.280]  because they'd already paid them off that was the model of paying off the
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:20.200]  Iraqis to stand down both times that's the model of infiltrating they have
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:24.520]  Delta Force buying off all the local police chiefs in the US right now and
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:30.560]  what I show is okay Lyndon Johnson was happy the Kennedys were gonna expose
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:35.240]  Lyndon Johnson's corruption and they had the article set to go in Life
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:41.880]  Magazine and the Bobby Baker scandal where Johnson with one of his pages was
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:45.760]  running a prostitution ring out of the Senate they were working in vending
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:50.840]  machines with the mob in Chicago putting them on the Army bases and other Army
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:54.920]  Congress stay there yeah it's well-known LBJ ran a lot of horse I've even stayed

[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:06.240]  events and I haven't even gotten to second command of countries nuclear
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:10.200]  arsenal is suspended in the United States they claim for an investigation of
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:14.840]  gambling yeah right our intel's there's missing nukes at a dais air force base
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:18.600]  and we have that from very high-level sources and no one ever denied or
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:22.720]  responded to it even though we called them more than 10 times and sent emails
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:28.200]  but finishing up with a Kennedy situation this book explains the entire
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:33.080]  history of it why it happened and ties it in to the coup d'etat over this
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:38.320]  country who really killed Kennedy available in info wars store.com or by
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:45.600]  calling toll free 888-253-3139 and they are just harassing companies all over
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:49.920]  the US shutting down factories harassing doctors even doctors that have
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:55.200]  small clinics they're shutting down the industry everywhere that's exactly what
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:59.080]  the Nazis did not just in Germany but everywhere else they shut down everybody
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:04.320]  but party members so it's really a takeover of the economy I think America's
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:08.240]  waking up to this though Dr. Corsi we see the indicators of it everywhere oh I
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:12.240]  think so too I mean it ties in to what you've been saying Alex I mean the
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:18.080]  Lyndon Johnson was happy to use the false flag and the golf of Tonkin incident
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:23.320]  which never happened to fight the war and to allow the Vietnam War to be in the
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:29.840]  control of the CIA also running drugs at the same time CIA has always worked with
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:35.000]  the mob and running drugs in fact one of the assassins I point out who was found
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:42.200]  in Dallas November 22nd 1963 was a well-known Corsican international
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:47.200]  assassin who went back to the attempts to kill De Gaulle who was helping with the
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:52.880]  mob and CIA with the drug trafficking in Vietnam there's another reason the
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:59.120]  military in the CIA and you know big business wanted Vietnam to be fought
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:04.360]  huge amount of drugs were going to be and by the way De Gaulle De Gaulle was
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:08.280]  also trying to be president of France as well and not being part of NATO and
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:11.600]  wanted his own nuclear weapons that's why they tried to kill him of course and
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:16.520]  also it ties into as you said that the current I bring it forward because
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:21.080]  Kennedy was also going to eliminate the Federal Reserve he was going to break up
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:26.560]  the CIA instead what we have is a world that the Nazis would have loved to have
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:31.880]  lived in with Germany heading the EU not a shot fired a regional government
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:38.480]  controlled by Germany in the EU transatlantic partnership the NSA
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:41.920]  listening to every conversation in America and a huge welfare state it's a
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:45.760]  Nazi model and then wars no one should be surprised
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:49.640]  Saddam Hussein no weapons of mass destruction of course it was a CIA
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:54.240]  lie for the beginning and it's going on today Assad using the chemical weapons
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:58:01.240]  more CIA lies John Kerry beating the war drums the Secretary of State when in
[01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:06.040]  fact the UN says it was the rebels when in fact you know why are we going to
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:14.000]  support on the al-Qaeda and these jihadi mercenaries in Syria there's no good
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:19.280]  guys we've already supported them in Benghazi and in Libya to defeat Qaddafi
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:25.280]  we're on the wrong side of you know the the Muslim world fighting with al-Qaeda
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:31.360]  we've become al-Qaeda and it's all the CIA lie these wars are fought not for US
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:36.000]  interest but to benefit the Saudi Arabian and it's a war on the individual in the
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:40.120]  free market because we're a threat to them stay there

[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:37.720]  all right Harondo Rivera is gonna pop in to give us his take on Obamacare the
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:42.520]  government shutdown arming the Alcada rebels all of it in the next segment then
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:46.200]  I'll get into all the news I haven't gotten into the news it's up on drug
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:50.960]  report.com the new NSA info about death squads operating not just overseas but
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:54.880]  here in America that would make the Nazis proud and Dr. Jerome course he's
[02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:58.680]  with us for five more minutes who really killed Kennedy 50 years later just
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:02.560]  probably the best book I've ever read on the Kennedy assassination because it
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:06.720]  ties into everything else and it's all the real info too because I'm quite a
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:10.880]  buff on the subject obviously hosting the show over 18 years and this is
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:14.600]  something I would give people that were doubters this will wake people up
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:19.160]  going back to Dr. Corsi sir in the four minutes we've got left we're obviously in
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:23.760]  a historic moment it's obviously very creepy what the bureaucrats and
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:27.880]  regulators are doing what what do you recommend everybody do to really turn
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:32.360]  the tide and I think we have a chance to beat these people if we take action but
[02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:36.480]  what is the lay of the battlefield right now well I think this you know we're
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:40.600]  coming up with a government shutdown and a government shutdown people should you
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:47.040]  know encourage the representatives in Congress go ahead and shut the
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:50.160]  government down you know the government wants you to feel it's gonna be so
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:54.000]  painful everything so awful is gonna happen that they're gonna they want us
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:58.640]  to beg to keep the government open not to shut it down even at the pain of
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:05.000]  imposing Obamacare there's another scare tactic to get the government over the
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:11.160]  final hurdle to where Obamacare cannot be defunded this is a critical battle
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:17.000]  people should be happy to see the battle going forward this you know all the
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.960]  economic pain we're suffering from Obamacare the part-time jobs the wrecking
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:28.400]  of private insurance the increased costs of medical care these were intended by
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:32.120]  the people who wrote the legislation that's the hard thing to get your mind
[02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:37.280]  around it was intended to wreck private health care it was intended to send
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:41.200]  people more into the arms of government dependency and the only way we're gonna
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:45.200]  break it is to tell the government no we won't do it we're not going to accept
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:49.920]  more debt you'll go back to John Kennedy trying to break up the CIA into a
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:53.840]  thousand pieces we should never have fought in Vietnam it was a false flag
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:58.000]  from the beginning we've got to break up the Federal Reserve like Jack Kennedy
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.800]  would have done start printing our own money with the Treasury and tell these
[02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:09.360]  banksters we're not gonna put more power into this new world order lie you know
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:15.080]  you it seems like you've gotten more bold recently dr. Corsi and I would say
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:19.400]  you're on fire is it because you sense that the quickening the crossroads the
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:25.880]  jump point the event horizon is is is arriving if we've got a government in
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:32.240]  place that is willing to do a false flag in Syria on chemical weapons lying
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:39.600]  about it in order to put us more in the hands of al-Qaeda and jihadi mercenaries
[02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:45.280]  in Syria if that's who our government wants us to fight with if this final
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:50.800]  pushes on with Obamacare we're now at 17 trillion dollars and about not to be
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:54.200]  able to buy any more of our debt the only thing left is for these new world

[02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:28.640]  old watching Geraldo Rivera on his investigative reports on everything from
[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:36.600]  the vault of Al Capone or whatever it was to drug King Ben's being arrested he
[02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:42.200]  is literally a TV journalistic legend and also got arrested once protesting
[02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:45.400]  Geraldo I wasn't really protesting Geraldo is protesting mainstream media
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:48.840]  but you can't really call him mainstream media be somebody that works in the
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:53.840]  mainstream media he is a real original and he joins us for just this segment
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:57.680]  today I wanted to get him on about Syria but a lot of other things have happened
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:01.640]  the government shut down Obamacare everything that's happening a nuclear
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:05.840]  Iran are these talks real where they said they want to work with the West John
[02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:10.400]  Kerry seems to think so but Geraldo again thank you for joining us people can
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:16.160]  follow you on your Twitter at Geraldo Rivera but first off what about the state
[02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:20.560]  of the country in the world is my instinct wrong that people are more awake
[02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:26.000]  and getting more upset now than they have in our lifetimes well first of all
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:30.880]  Alex it's a pleasure being on and you you say I'm an original so are you it
[02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:35.280]  takes one to know one so I'm pleased to be on your program today now in terms of
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:41.760]  the state of the world I think that in terms of domestic policy and Obamacare
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:48.600]  ever since 2010 I think you really have a very motivated electorate a lot of
[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:53.000]  people are tuning in in a way they haven't paying attention and getting
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:57.400]  into the detail of government in a way they haven't been in a long time I and
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:02.720]  I applaud that on the big stage the the stuff with Iran and the nukes and
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:06.400]  curia and the poison gas you know once in a while people pay attention but I
[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:10.880]  think generally speaking you know the feeling around most Americans and I
[02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:14.320]  think this is what President Obama ran into the roadblock he ran into when he
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:19.080]  wanted to bomb Syria a lot of Americans just say hey you know screw it we've had
[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:23.320]  you know over a decade of involvement in all these foreign adventures we've
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:29.400]  bled extended trillions of dollars you know lost too many lives let's let them
[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:36.720]  sort it out themselves out shifting gears into just Obama in general he
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:41.120]  promised so much and then has so under delivered even to his constituents I
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:45.160]  think he's gonna go down as one of the most hated presidents ever and I'm sad
[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:49.680]  because I really wanted race relations you name it to get better under Obama and
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:53.560]  it seems like well the polls show it's gotten worse what's your take on that
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:11:01.000]  well you know Alex as a former hard left long-haired street lawyer radical
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:07.480]  protester against the war and pro civil rights in the in the 60s I have to say
[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:11.880]  that the election of the first black president in our history was it was like
[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:16.440]  a dream come true it was like the fulfillment of you know something I
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:19.680]  had worked for and never thought really I never thought I'd see it in my life
[02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:24.600]  so when you got elected you know I can remember how emotional I was and how
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:29.400]  positive it was but when you get down to it you've got to govern and I'm not you
[02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:34.920]  know part of it I have no doubt is the fact that the the hard right in the
[02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:39.120]  Republican Party doesn't want him to succeed I think that's part of it but I
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:44.080]  think a lot of it is you know when I think back to the days of you know Lyndon
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:49.880]  Johnson or even Bill Clinton we had it was certainly Reagan we had people that
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:53.960]  were you know they had their idealism they had their ideology they had their
[02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:58.160]  ideas but they were pragmatic enough to make things work and I think that a
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:03.160]  president Obama has been a terrible manager and he's been you know in terms
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:07.480]  of a divided government he hasn't in any way reached out in a way he should I
[02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:10.600]  think that a lot of what I'm doing or the speaker of the house and other
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:15.000]  Republicans are doing now is really appalling but I think Boehner is right
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:18.840]  the speaker is right when he says the president will negotiate with the
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:23.960]  Iranians but he won't negotiate with the Republican but I I I lament that fact
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:29.000]  and I I can't disagree that as of right now if history is going to freeze right
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:33.360]  now he would be regarded at best as a mediocre president now now
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:36.640]  Haroldo I didn't get you on to talk about all the amazing things you've done
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:39.360]  it is interesting and since I've got here before you get back into politics
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:44.320]  out of the hundred and seventy awards for journalism including prestigious
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:51.160]  Peabody Award Emmys National and local and so many others you know people
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:54.320]  forget you haven't just done the big sensational stories you've broken so
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:58.240]  many big investigative journalistic reports and been threatened been attacked
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:02.800]  out of everything you've done what are you most proud of there's no doubt about
[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:06.760]  I don't even hesitate the I've been so many stories thousands and thousands of
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:10.960]  stories but the stories I did about the institutionalized we used to call them
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:14.080]  mentally retarded how they call them developmentally disabled there's no
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:18.760]  doubt about it helping to close America's institution and institutions
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:22.480]  for the retarded is definitely what I wish they would put on my tombstone
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:27.480]  instead of opening Al Capone's wall so sleeping with this one of that one
[02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:32.480]  remember that we helped change the way the developmentally disabled are
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:36.120]  cared for in this country yeah that's why I brought that up because I just kind of
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:39.080]  spurred it out the Al Capone vault I bet you're sick of hearing about that it's
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:42.160]  like I'm sick of hearing I'm the guy with the bullhorn that's like oh you're
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:45.360]  the guy with the bullhorn it's like no I've done a couple of things other than a
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:49.080]  bullhorn you know so much is going on in the world right now my issue with
[02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:54.160]  Obamacare is it it was written by the insurance companies their stock has
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:59.840]  doubled in many cases and it's going to be selectively basically enforced a lot
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:03.480]  of people are exempt from it I mean I've got a big problem with Obamacare why
[02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:07.320]  do you think the American people have turned against it because it's so
[02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:11.480]  complicated because you're right about the insurance companies leading the
[02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:15.200]  leading the way I know that you know I got half a dozen people work for me in
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:20.800]  various the you know in this this thing on the boat in the backyard my
[02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:25.160]  secretary etc and my health interest for all those people has more than doubled
[02:14:25.160 --> 02:14:30.360]  in the last two years and you know I can't think that it's not related to
[02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:35.720]  to Obamacare and it's been so badly explained you know I'm I'm I'm a
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:40.840]  socialist enough that I want everybody to be have access to healthcare poor or
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:45.240]  rich you know you know I'm at that old line there the rich should live in the
[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:50.040]  poor should die you know I'm not I'm not for that but I I think when you turn
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:54.440]  something over to one industry as opposed to another industry they got to do
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:59.400]  what's self-serving you know the bill seems you know incredibly complex and
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:03.680]  why are they getting exemptions and why is Congress not participating in the
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:08.480]  same kind of system as everybody else is you know I I really think that it's a
[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:13.160]  big big big bollocks but on the other hand I don't like this government
[02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:16.280]  shutdown either I think that it's not gonna accomplish anything they've made
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:20.600]  the point to shut down the government cost a couple hundred million every day
[02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:26.480]  just like perm burning the money in your backyard I I don't I appreciate
[02:15:26.480 --> 02:15:31.840]  drama but not when it cost taxpayers money and it just seems that Congress is
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:36.400]  if you we talked about the president being mediocre if Barack Obama's
[02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:41.480]  mediocre the Congress is is pissed for if you get my drift. Harald I want to get
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:45.240]  into Iran and geopolitically where you think because you're a smart guy you've
[02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:47.760]  been in the Middle East all over the place you've been in Afghanistan you've
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:51.520]  probably seen more combat as a journalism than even somebody like
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:54.880]  Oliver North is every time there's a war going on I turn it on and you're on
[02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:58.880]  television I saw a report about three four years ago where you're in Afghanistan
[02:15:58.880 --> 02:16:03.440]  with the Marines where they admit that they're guarding the opium and helping
[02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:07.840]  basically produce it the argument is well this way al Qaeda won't get it what
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:12.040]  do you make of Ben Samadhi that you know it's covered the drug war from the time
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:16.880]  it began under Reagan to now that it's on record that our own troops are
[02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:22.360]  guarding the opium. Well I think the big picture you know I've been covering the
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:29.320]  drug war since Nixon you know since 1970 we've spent well over a trillion
[02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:34.440]  dollars the drug war is an absolute failure an absolute abject failure and
[02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:39.040]  it the throw people in jail you know 20 years for that they were there women in
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:43.440]  jail in upstate Bedford New York even in jail for 20 years because they carried
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:47.280]  an ounce of coke for their boyfriends and got busted because they got set up and
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:51.960]  I think it's preposterous I think that you know very much of a libertarian when
[02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:55.560]  it comes to that people have to sort that stuff out for themselves I think it's
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:17:00.840]  just absolutely dreadful the way we have and the what you you're speaking out
[02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:06.280]  of the Marines that's absolutely literally true our encampments were in
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:12.480]  the poppy field they would be the the harvesting of the crop happened right in
[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:17.040]  front of us that there I was with the brave Marines at that time and now
[02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:22.040]  helmet province again shot at and they are effectively guarding the the poppy
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:26.240]  field I think it's really it's a disastrous awful you know in the
[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:30.880]  bigger picture you know we're exhausted after Afghanistan Afghanistan you know
[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:34.880]  we paid back to people who got us and I'm all for revenge I think that that was a
[02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:39.720]  good idea hanging in there now 13 years 14 years I mean my goodness when does
[02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:46.360]  that end Iraq was an absolute utter zero it was for nothing you know and you
[02:17:46.360 --> 02:17:50.520]  know I debate with Eric bowling on possible time Eric was accusing the
[02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:56.240]  Iranians of 9-11 the Iranians weren't in 9-11 the Iraqis weren't in 9-11 that
[02:17:56.240 --> 02:18:01.800]  was the Saudis our dear friends that were you know the 15 of the 19 hijackers
[02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:06.160]  with Saudis I just think that you got to really be careful before you commit
[02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:11.280]  U.S. blood and treasured to these these foreign affairs they you know I'm sick of
[02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:16.680]  being in combat you know 12 funds in Iraq 12 funds in Afghanistan Somalia
[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:20.720]  every place in between I'm all for you get the people to get us to try to
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:25.880]  preserve world order you guard the ships and the horn of Africa you keep
[02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:31.240]  commerce blowing but to send the land army into any of these countries now
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:35.680]  that's why I pose a president Obama when he wanted to bomb Syria because of the
[02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:40.000]  poison gas you know it's just it's just not our job what what about the UN I
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:45.040]  mean is it does it stand for anything does it kind of do anything you know I
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:49.440]  think the answer is obvious now we've only got about four or five minutes left
[02:18:49.440 --> 02:18:52.160]  with you her all do I really appreciate you spending time joining us you've got
[02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:57.200]  your syndicated radio show you're doing the news show there on Fox you've got
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:19:01.040]  so much you know other things that are going on let's talk about you and your
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:04.760]  life right now what you're you're mainly focused on politically but also
[02:19:04.760 --> 02:19:08.080]  personally because folks obviously want to know a little bit about you and what
[02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:11.880]  you're doing currently and then I want to finish up with geopolitically how do
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:15.720]  you think this is going to end with Iran all right but in terms of me you know I
[02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:21.200]  do the Fox news stuff I've kind of been an out an outlier an oddball at Fox now
[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:27.960]  going on 13 years I went to Fox after the 9-11 attacks because I wanted to
[02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:31.360]  cover the war and I think you're right I think I've been in more combat
[02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:36.040]  situations than any certainly any celebrity journalist I you know it's
[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:39.880]  been something I've been drawn to I have a lot of pictures on my wall of me and
[02:19:39.880 --> 02:19:43.200]  GI's that have been killed since they took the picture with me you know
[02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:47.640]  Afghanistan Iraq it's awful you know I've watched them in their families go
[02:19:47.640 --> 02:19:51.800]  through all the stress and now they're coming home and you know I'm very very
[02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:56.560]  much aware of and covering stories about how they have all the problems the
[02:19:56.560 --> 02:20:00.240]  baggage from the war suicide and so forth I think we have to totally be
[02:20:00.240 --> 02:20:05.520]  involved with that I'm a father of five I'm you know I'm thinking about you know
[02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:11.240]  where where I go from here in life you know I've done so much I want to stick
[02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:16.200]  it out I had a 43 year career you know it's everybody's got over all the
[02:20:16.200 --> 02:20:19.800]  story you have one everyone's got a story like that in your case it was being
[02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:25.400]  arrested on 48th Street and 6th Avenue perhaps more colorful than most but
[02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:30.200]  there's been a lot of anecdotes a lot of people whose lives I've touched one
[02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:34.960]  way or the other along the way and you know it's sometimes I can be you know
[02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:39.800]  hardcore I got scored the exclusive with the Iranian Foreign Minister Friday
[02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:43.280]  night on the other hand the month before that I took that nude selfie of
[02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:48.320]  myself so I'm still still got my freaky side and you know I hope I always do I
[02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:53.120]  want to be unpredictable I'm a Republican but I'm a pragmatist and a
[02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:56.640]  lot of what the Democrats say I prefer what the Republicans say sometimes so
[02:20:56.640 --> 02:21:03.200]  you know I'm I think that the one thing Alex is if they're all this time being
[02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:08.480]  having the advantage of you know they kind of one game at a time I get cut a
[02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:11.560]  lot of slack that a lot of other people you for instance you got a lot more
[02:21:11.560 --> 02:21:15.680]  heat when you take a controversial position than I do these things up
[02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:19.360]  well I do and you're about to leave us and I want to finish up with Iran and
[02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:22.520]  your phone's breaking up just a bit there but Geraldo Rivera joins us
[02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:26.720]  legendary journalist celebrity journalist you name it but but unlike many
[02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:30.080]  celebrity journalists there's a lot of hard reporting over the years you even
[02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:33.600]  if you love him or hate him you've got to admire the courage that he's had over
[02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:37.200]  the years and he also got pretty mad we're showing some video of that now
[02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:41.200]  whenever I was bullhorning his live broadcast he gave me the middle finger
[02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:45.680]  that's pretty funny you don't see Geraldo I didn't give you the clenched
[02:21:45.680 --> 02:21:49.720]  fist though that's who I really was oh exactly so what did you think when we
[02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:53.520]  showed up bullhorning you well first of all it took me a while to figure out what
[02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:58.520]  the issue was and then you know then it was you know not a living with an
[02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:02.320]  inside job and I got that in that the anger though the level of anger was
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:06.200]  extraordinary I mean it was just I mean I was pissed off at you you guys were
[02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:10.000]  pissed off at me and then we were we didn't you know if I had thought it
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:14.320]  through in retrospect what I should have done is just invite one of you to come
[02:22:14.320 --> 02:22:18.600]  and tell me you particularly tell me what the beef was you know because once
[02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:23.280]  the substance of the issue became more known I mean it became a point where
[02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:28.200]  there's really some situations where you got to talk about the facts and
[02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:32.840]  circumstances what you even later had me on your show to put out why I thought
[02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:37.400]  it was an inside job when I say inside job I mean they knew bare minimum even
[02:22:37.400 --> 02:22:41.640]  Bodita agrees with that you had on the show that day and that is and they use
[02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:46.160]  it to take our liberties and to attack Iraq and now look at Simon Seymour
[02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:50.720]  Hirsch coming out the multi-time Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist saying
[02:22:50.720 --> 02:22:53.960]  they've been lauding raid basically was fake didn't happen I've talked to the
[02:22:53.960 --> 02:22:57.280]  Navy SEALs who were involved they say it was a look-alike they really killed
[02:22:57.280 --> 02:23:02.640]  whether that's correct or not no one buys what this system's saying anymore
[02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:06.640]  and I saw the press report on a few weeks ago they said when I rolled a
[02:23:06.640 --> 02:23:11.040]  Rivera and Alex Jones agree that the Syrians you know thing is stage and
[02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:15.000]  that Al Qaeda did it with the gas you know Obama's in trouble and so in
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:20.200]  closing what do you think about funding and arming Al Qaeda and I get toppling
[02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:23.880]  Assad because he's buddies with Iran but he's not starting wars and he's not
[02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:28.560]  Iran so segue out of the gas and who was really behind that into Iran or all
[02:23:28.560 --> 02:23:34.200]  the Rivera let me say one thing first on the other big picture isn't it
[02:23:34.200 --> 02:23:40.520]  interesting that Alex Jones is right about the NSA in the Patriot Act and
[02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:45.800]  all those things that you were criticized for being paranoid and crazy
[02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:52.040]  about it turns out that they are the NSA is in in our lunch and they're using it
[02:23:52.040 --> 02:23:57.040]  to catch their girlfriends cheating or you know bosses you know it's I think
[02:23:57.040 --> 02:24:03.640]  that you give yourself a pat on the back on that big issue in terms of in terms
[02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:09.720]  of Syria and poison gas I think that the best thing about it I mean it is the
[02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:14.680]  best thing about something so horrible is that you got the Russians engaged and
[02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:20.120]  you got the Iranians engaged in a way that neither of those two enemy quote
[02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:25.080]  unquote powers have been engaged with the United States and with the West and I
[02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:30.400]  think that's a good thing and maybe just maybe we're joking joking about the
[02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:36.800]  United Nations and how little you know it does what nothing it does and you
[02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:41.480]  know maybe have some kind of dialogue going on where you can actually see
[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:46.480]  chemical weapons being collected and being destroyed I think that that would
[02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:52.120]  be a good thing for the world out I agree with you in closing I hope that
[02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:55.240]  whenever you're breaking some big news every once in a while we get you to pop
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:59.920]  in and I enjoyed being on your show I guess that was on Saturday a few weeks
[02:24:59.920 --> 02:25:04.160]  ago and of course my audience follows Fox News most of our libertarian or
[02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:07.920]  conservative but a lot of them are classical liberals but again plug your
[02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:11.200]  New York radio show because that's also syndicated I know people listen to it
[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:15.360]  over the web radio thank you very much Alex and yeah let's say don't be a
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:19.920]  stranger we'll we'll swap swap appearances I appreciate it let me just
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:24.200]  ask you this at Geraldo Rivera is the place to follow you on Twitter I'm in
[02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:28.960]  real life shows do you think do you think just your gut because I think the
[02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:31.880]  Iranians there are starting a little bit scared they've put a guy that's not as
[02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:36.160]  hard-line in I hope for peace I hope that Israel can work it out with them but
[02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:40.520]  Netanyahu thinks it's fake what does your gut tell you about Iran will we end up
[02:25:40.520 --> 02:25:56.640]  attacking them no 30 seconds in 1980 in 1988 my talk show was taken to air in the
[02:25:56.640 --> 02:26:01.000]  Soviet Union Monday through Friday the Geraldo show aired in the old Soviet
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:06.120]  Union I swear to God shows like mine help bring down the Soviet oh yeah I
[02:26:06.120 --> 02:26:11.000]  because the people in Russia looked at the washing machine commercials and the
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:15.960]  car commercials and the and the you know the color TV commercials and they
[02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:20.880]  wanted that stuff the people of Iran want that stuff the economic sanctions
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:26.160]  have destroyed the economy in Iran if you look at the Persian people in Southern
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:30.840]  California they own half of LA already they are enterprising that the very
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:37.480]  western-oriented if the Mullahs and the ayatollahs I don't give them that kind
[02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:40.920]  of freedom the negative you know them that the Iranian people will take care
[02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:45.440]  of them I want to encourage that I want to encourage you know Iran opening up
[02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:49.160]  and you know that's the best way to keep Israel safe I think out by the way
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:52.920]  that is one of your big accomplishments I've actually seen it quoted in
[02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:58.680]  sociology text online to some of the prestigious universities that actually
[02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:05.840]  they do site Coca-Cola Pepsi Levi's and shows like Geraldo Rivera I forgot you
[02:27:05.840 --> 02:27:10.400]  were one of the first shows to beam into there no I was the first show I was the
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:16.760]  first talk show from the United States on the air in the Soviet Union man talk
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:20.240]  about changing the world Geraldo Rivera thank you so much thank you so much for
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:25.280]  the time all right folks there goes there goes Geraldo that was a great live
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:30.200]  interview they're with him glad to go on his show and glad to get him on our
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:34.080]  broadcast what a character you know I tell you people that you watched as a
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:38.240]  teenager and then they're on your show I mean it's one thing to go on his show
[02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:41.160]  but then he's on my show I'm not even really star struck it's more just
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:46.560]  interesting because I could care less if he was some you know sitcom guy from the
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:52.880]  80s that that I didn't watch it's just a fact that you're growing up and you
[02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:56.320]  never think you're gonna know Jesse Ventura or you're growing up you never
[02:27:56.320 --> 02:28:01.760]  think you're gonna know Charlie Sheen or you're gonna know Geraldo Rivera and we
[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:05.360]  found the low res video online it's actually my film truth rising that's
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:10.280]  one of my best films because it's cinema verite it's not voiceovers it's not
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:15.920]  graphics it's not articles it's real people I think truth rising that's
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:21.880]  probably our least-selling film ever that's really unfortunate I mean it's
[02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:25.720]  free online too it's only been seen a couple million times and people go a
[02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:28.480]  couple million that's a lot that's done that's nothing folks compared to the
[02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:33.160]  other films and and I think it's my best film it's cinema verite and it's about
[02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:36.360]  activism and waking up you see it in high death Geraldo getting really mad he
[02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:40.400]  almost climbed down off the thing because it was an hour-long show and it was
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:45.720]  live and I just ruined the whole thing with the 9-11's an inside job over it
[02:28:45.720 --> 02:28:53.720]  and but you know he's an activist who was a lawyer and all these famous standoffs
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:57.280]  and stuff so I think that's why he kind of liked it afterwards a few months
[02:28:57.280 --> 02:29:01.240]  after I was on they go hey he wants you on you know he you know he now he knows
[02:29:01.240 --> 02:29:04.640]  he already knew you were and kind of likes what you're doing because the
[02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:08.360]  truth is I don't want to get Geraldo in trouble behind the scenes he knows
[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:13.520]  exactly what's going on he's a smart cat as okay I don't he didn't say don't tell
[02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:17.440]  anybody it's off record I've just talked to him and a few of his people you know
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:21.280]  short here and there behind the scenes you're in breaks on live TV or other
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:26.600]  things and he knows a lot he knows a lot but he knows how to get it on Fox
[02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:29.640]  News that the Marines are growing opium he's like wonderful you're here
[02:29:29.640 --> 02:29:34.280]  growing opium they just didn't hit it all and then he doesn't get in trouble it
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:38.640]  just goes out on air but we got Geraldo Rivera to talk about that folks they
[02:29:38.640 --> 02:29:42.320]  loaded on the C-130's it comes into the air bases and then when the cops catch
[02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:47.160]  your kids with it they put them in the right room in the present okay the
[02:29:47.160 --> 02:29:52.720]  government is pure evil we'll be right back we're on the March the empires on
[02:29:52.720 --> 02:29:58.760]  the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:30:00.120 --> 02:30:04.840]  why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world
[02:30:04.840 --> 02:30:08.920]  on health care why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet the
[02:30:08.920 --> 02:30:14.960]  highest rates of diabetes autism and every other major disease it all comes
[02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:20.040]  down to one thing we are what we eat our food is devoid of nutrition and
[02:30:20.040 --> 02:30:25.160]  processed with poisons and additives our water is filled with toxic poisons and

[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:43.960]  even cover it anymore they have these stakeouts I used to do it about six
[02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:47.880]  months a year a year and a half usually about in a year they'll move in next to
[02:37:47.880 --> 02:37:53.120]  Amish they'll pose as like you know hippies or whatever and go please sell
[02:37:53.120 --> 02:37:56.680]  me milk and it came out in court in one case they're like it's alright brother

[02:38:38.200 --> 02:38:45.840]  reports the reports are now just pouring in from people I know I mean you'll have
[02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:49.440]  a fair and and they won't tell you that you're supposed to be part of the
[02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:54.000]  premises ID not under law but under the policy of the fair and they'll find out
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:58.600]  who under a government stunt they've pulled nationwide people listing will
[02:38:58.600 --> 02:39:03.600]  know about this in your area this is a stunt a Psyop they will give the award

[02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:18.000]  under premises animal ID even though there's no law they'll say it's the
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:22.560]  policy of that they'll let you win and then revoke it on the stage and have you
[02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:28.840]  cry in front of the whole fair to go oh I better get premises ID animal ID that
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:34.600]  waives all your rights I mean it's all psych warfare everything is a total
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:43.880]  warfare against us a total criminal warfare a total criminal warfare total
[02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:48.080]  evil drug dealing the government runs the child kidnapping rings look that up
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:53.240]  Chicago Tribune the government runs the cocaine the heroin the Prozac the
[02:39:53.240 --> 02:39:59.920]  Ritalin all of it on your kids it is a group of pure crystalline evil on the
[02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:05.840]  top below it is a bunch of idiots on power trips and all I want to say is
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:09.520]  God help us because they're coming and they're about to bring the whole
[02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:12.880]  country down and they're going to collectivize everything and a lot of
[02:40:12.880 --> 02:40:15.920]  people will know it's evil but they'll still go along with it to work in the
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:22.880]  system to survive I cannot describe to you the hellishness of these people
[02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:26.880]  they're so criminal see because being criminal means you don't care about other
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:31.160]  people you don't value not cheating somebody so you'll even cheat yourself
[02:40:31.160 --> 02:40:36.080]  that's why out of 420 something reactors 91% of them are leaking now out in
[02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:40.320]  California and other areas when they leak now and the alarms go off they turn
[02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:44.240]  the alarms off and then disable them yeah the alarm was going off all the time
[02:40:44.240 --> 02:40:49.000]  for radiation leaks you know what we got a federal waiver we're just going to
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:59.040]  turn those alarms off didn't let the troops use DU until 1991 now they're
[02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:03.520]  using them in local shooting ranges the government uses so what if it's a death
[02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:10.240]  sentence to those that use it kill them 20 years on the road the criminals
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:15.640]  don't even care about themselves so what if fuel ponds all over the country or
[02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:20.360]  malfunctioning and leaking and starting to catch on fire sometimes so what let it
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:23.960]  catch on fire let it blow up let radiation so what we're just criminals we
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:29.360]  don't care we're tough we like it and really they're just unorganized
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:34.880]  undisciplined scum who could care less about anybody or the future and who live
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:39.040]  horrible degenerate lives and their other families are all messes I mean
[02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:43.200]  these globalists are just unbelievable and we're even worse because we sit here
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:50.640]  and we bow down to them we sit here and we go along with everything they do
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:55.080]  instead of collectively realizing the government's an enemy now and the people
[02:41:55.080 --> 02:41:59.560]  that run it are the occupiers of the country look at this article right here
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:07.240]  Yale professor Fukushima will threaten humanity for thousands of years and it
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:11.480]  goes on a Yale professor is cautioning the world to wake up from its nuclear
[02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:15.920]  slumber and face the severity of the Fukushima radiation crisis warning
[02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:19.960]  that all of the humanity will be threatened for thousands of years of
[02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:24.880]  Fukushima unit four pool is not kept cool the disturbing statements act as a
[02:42:24.880 --> 02:42:28.920]  voice of reality when it comes to the depth of Fukushima disaster an event
[02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:32.920]  that world governments have relentlessly attempted to downplay while
[02:42:32.920 --> 02:42:36.760]  silently shutting down radiation counters and raising acceptable levels of
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:42.400]  radiation in the food supply that's what I mean this is madness these people are
[02:42:42.400 --> 02:42:48.800]  the infection of degeneracy I'm gonna get into the other news now I briefly
[02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:52.640]  want to tell you that you can see this open bottle I've been taking it twice
[02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:57.480]  a day the nascent nuclear iodine it's it's non-radioactive it's called nuclear
[02:42:57.480 --> 02:43:02.840]  or excuse me atomic iodine is the proper name because because the nuclei
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:10.440]  because the atoms it is pure real elemental iodine and you can get it
[02:43:10.440 --> 02:43:14.760]  it's reportedly just the best for the thyroid overall both function energy
[02:43:14.760 --> 02:43:19.120]  just all of the bodies is so essential so you need this so they take it out of
[02:43:19.120 --> 02:43:22.720]  the salt and put fluoride in in the water which is the bad fluoride that fills
[02:43:22.720 --> 02:43:27.680]  up the thyroid I mean it's just amazing and it's on record as something that
[02:43:27.680 --> 02:43:32.800]  detoxes and binds to fluoride it's just as so many other things info wars life.com

[02:47:02.760 --> 02:47:06.640]  also on air as you just heard pretty much apologized to me and said I used to
[02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:13.320]  think you were extreme but now you know it looks like it's worse than you said
[02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:18.440]  and then that's what I'm telling people this stuff I'm not up here saying all
[02:47:18.440 --> 02:47:22.400]  these scary things to be sensational I'm saying these scary things because
[02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:25.640]  they're true and the scary thing is going to happen whether we admit it or
[02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:31.920]  not might as well do something about it and I think about how arrogant and
[02:47:31.920 --> 02:47:38.400]  aggressive and predatory the federal government is and these corporations and
[02:47:38.400 --> 02:47:43.440]  the stuff I've seen them do and how they treat people these are people that get
[02:47:43.440 --> 02:47:47.720]  off on hurting innocent folks up this weekend we were up here working on
[02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:52.400]  Saturday night and they were airing a unabomber special and it was
[02:47:52.400 --> 02:47:55.680]  rebroadcasting at like 11 o'clock at night before I left here we're working
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:48:01.400]  on Obama deception and they were like yeah Kaczynski kept saying I'm not
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:05.840]  insane I'm not insane I don't want to see any psychiatrist and that the FBI
[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:10.080]  said he thought that they would probably under mind control folks Theodore
[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:16.160]  Kaczynski the unabomber is on record to be a long-term volunteer subject of MK
[02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:20.800]  ultra and evidence is clear it was then part of a super secret government
[02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:26.760]  program of sheep dipped or people that basically change their identity for a
[02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:31.360]  time and that he then left some type of super secret operation by the way this
[02:48:31.360 --> 02:48:34.440]  all came out we just don't know the details it came out in the LA Times
[02:48:34.440 --> 02:48:40.000]  other papers during his trial you can look that up and how he had these super
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:45.560]  mathematical codes that were above stuff the Russians used Kaczynski is smart
[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:50.240]  now in a supermax torture center but do you think he really came up with all
[02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:54.000]  that no ladies and gentlemen we don't know exactly what happened with Theodore
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:59.040]  Kaczynski but we know you look at his eyes when he when he drove out when
[02:48:59.040 --> 02:49:05.120]  they got him at his cabin and you look at the eyes the way he looks knowingly at
[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:14.200]  that camera Kaczynski as an academic was let in on the big plane and you know he
[02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:17.200]  said the robots and the computers are gonna take over and wreck everything and
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:21.560]  humans are gonna merge the machines and this is horrible the end of humanity I've
[02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:25.160]  got a bomb a bunch of people over a long period of time just to get the
[02:49:25.160 --> 02:49:30.560]  attention to put this manifesto out and I'm not defending what he did folks but
[02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:37.240]  imagine the focus for more than a decade to quietly live in a shack to do
[02:49:37.240 --> 02:49:40.920]  something like that to just try to be able to get enough attention as his
[02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:46.840]  publicity stunt to finally put that manifesto out and I'm gonna warn everybody
[02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:49.720]  that works for the system you're not stupid and you know why you've been
[02:49:49.720 --> 02:49:52.720]  put in place they've done psychological tests on you they've hired you because
[02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:56.520]  you're either follow orders mindlessly or you're really stupid or you're a
[02:49:56.520 --> 02:50:00.520]  psychopath or sociopath and even a psychopath ought to be smart enough to
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:11.000]  know the end game of this thing coming to fruition is not going to be good or
[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:21.360]  anybody it is going to be very destructive and the establishment itself
[02:50:21.360 --> 02:50:27.400]  is probably never going to make it out of this if they actually implement this
[02:50:27.400 --> 02:50:37.240]  you don't come back from this this system they've set up really is a great
[02:50:37.240 --> 02:50:44.200]  work of evil it is a satanic art piece and this planet burnout destroyed will
[02:50:44.200 --> 02:50:50.280]  be Satan's greatest masterwork if we let Satan do that and even if you don't
[02:50:50.280 --> 02:50:56.240]  believe in Satan I will assure you the dark entity exists and wants to kill
[02:50:56.240 --> 02:51:03.560]  you in your entire line every time you eat a cooked food your body responds by
[02:51:03.560 --> 02:51:06.960]  producing an increase in circulating white blood cells this happens because
[02:51:06.960 --> 02:51:11.840]  nature designed us to eat food that is undamaged at the molecular level when we
[02:51:11.840 --> 02:51:15.520]  eat food to normal cooking temperatures we change the shape of the molecules
[02:51:15.520 --> 02:51:19.960]  into shapes the body cannot use the body now looks at them as toxins and
[02:51:19.960 --> 02:51:23.600]  allergens in an effort to protect itself from this irritant the body
[02:51:23.600 --> 02:51:27.520]  intelligently increases the amount of circulating white blood cells to act as
[02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:31.240]  garbage collectors white blood cells gobble up all the unusable damaged
[02:51:31.240 --> 02:51:35.320]  food particles to neutralize their cell damaging properties this puts stress on
[02:51:35.320 --> 02:51:38.560]  your organs of elimination and your body is subject to cell damage and

[02:54:09.240 --> 02:54:13.680]  hey I want to hit a few final stories that are big that I haven't gotten to I'll
[02:54:13.680 --> 02:54:17.440]  probably do a news alert tonight on the news or after the news and seven o'clock
[02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:21.440]  tonight to keep the show down to 30 minutes down to be disciplined but I
[02:54:21.440 --> 02:54:24.920]  may be doing a news alert in fact I think I'm gonna do it after the news
[02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:33.440]  tonight probably live to get it all this other stuff I haven't covered yet it
[02:54:33.440 --> 02:54:39.040]  just keeps hitting me the desperateness of this and the immediacy of we've been
[02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:43.600]  absolutely right and then some we have the worst people in history running
[02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:47.760]  society and they're so dangerous they're so evil they want to hurt poor
[02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:52.920]  people they want to abort babies they're actively evil and I just cannot
[02:54:52.920 --> 02:54:59.520]  impress on people how much danger we're in and I see the awakening happening
[02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:03.480]  but it's not big enough it's not fast enough I just wish people knew what I
[02:55:03.480 --> 02:55:06.440]  knew because I'm getting up here saying you know these are pure evil it they are
[02:55:06.440 --> 02:55:13.200]  pure evil it's almost just so petty to even have half measures I don't I don't
[02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:18.140]  know what we do to stop them I talked about the first hour today
[02:55:18.140 --> 02:55:21.120]  retransmissions coming up on the live show ends it was very important took me
[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:24.680]  an hour to break it down but in there is the essence of how we're gonna beat them
[02:55:24.680 --> 02:55:30.600]  we really are occupied by people that that carry out warfare as an economy who
[02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:36.000]  do who are against humanity fundamentally consciously and write
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:41.360]  books and white paper saying it and I don't want to just become acclimated and
[02:55:41.360 --> 02:55:46.760]  used to this where I go along with it where I adapt to the tyranny because
[02:55:46.760 --> 02:55:52.760]  that's what a globalist famously told me the head of a major u.s. bank will happen
[02:55:52.760 --> 02:56:00.480]  to be on first-class flight with going to be on the view and he told me some of
[02:56:00.480 --> 02:56:06.200]  the stuff off record so what's off record stays off record he said Alex
[02:56:06.200 --> 02:56:11.160]  humans will adapt to whatever we do and he was talking about he was a space
[02:56:11.160 --> 02:56:16.040]  alien because they are alien dots there and he said people are gonna go on with
[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:19.320]  whatever we want to do we're gonna nationalize the economy through the
[02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:24.280]  crises we're gonna take it over and the public is too dumb to even understand
[02:56:24.280 --> 02:56:32.000]  it that's why we deserve to be in control and be lucky lucky we're in
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:38.040]  charge and the plane landed he got up was perfectly done here in his perfect
[02:56:38.040 --> 02:56:49.440]  suit that's perfect black french coat and just looked at me and just laughed he's
[02:56:49.440 --> 02:56:53.120]  part of the ruling class he was visiting his dad is a retired general and
[02:56:53.120 --> 02:57:04.880]  really old in San Antonio Air Force General and he's sitting there looking
[02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:09.600]  at me and he goes yeah I know who you are he goes you're not gonna stop us he
[02:57:09.600 --> 02:57:12.720]  was I'd tell you something off record cuz you know they know I'm ever say
[02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:17.800]  something that's off record on record it'll not to give me info I said sure
[02:57:17.800 --> 02:57:21.960]  he just sat there and just tried to demoralize me you're not gonna stop
[02:57:21.960 --> 02:57:28.800]  nothing it's like when I had Thomas Barnett the big army psych warfare chief
[02:57:28.800 --> 02:57:33.880]  he was teaching at the Army War College at the time I saw him on c-span say we
[02:57:33.880 --> 02:57:36.720]  work for the New World Order we work for foreign banks we're taking over
[02:57:36.720 --> 02:57:39.760]  nothing will stop us so I called him to get him on as a guest is like 12 years
[02:57:39.760 --> 02:57:44.160]  ago 11 years ago he didn't know who I was then he figured it out and I called
[02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:46.840]  him that day because he said no I'm not coming on to the board operator so I
[02:57:46.840 --> 02:57:49.960]  called him out in the break I said police are come on he goes no way I'm
[02:57:49.960 --> 02:57:55.360]  coming on your show I know you are now and I went well listen we're you know I
[02:57:55.360 --> 02:57:58.040]  know you want to push a new world government but we're gonna beat you and
[02:57:58.040 --> 02:58:01.960]  he goes you're not gonna beat us you're never gonna beat us he goes you're gonna
[02:58:01.960 --> 02:58:06.520]  fail they started laughing at me I mean it's just like they're out in the open
[02:58:06.520 --> 02:58:14.080]  nothing will stop us I mean it's just like it's just like whoa and I remember
[02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:22.600]  him just going I mean these guys are just I mean villainous man villains

[02:59:08.440 --> 02:59:13.360]  silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC
[02:59:13.360 --> 02:59:18.880]  current this technology is so powerful it must be made in a laboratory colloidal
[02:59:18.880 --> 02:59:24.320]  and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current making supernatural
[02:59:24.320 --> 02:59:29.840]  silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses bacteria and fungus
