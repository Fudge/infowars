[00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:09.772]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.772 --> 00:00:11.354]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.354 --> 00:00:12.895]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:17.098]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.098 --> 00:00:21.200]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:45.329]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday the 30th day of September 2013.
[00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:59.697]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours covering the most important information that I can possibly imagine concerning the future of this country and the world.
[00:01:01.098 --> 00:01:26.103]  I have all of my reporters and writers listening to me right now, because I told them I wanted them to tune in, as they do most days to the radio broadcast, because I want to have the full focus of the InfoWars operation in the next week on what's hiding in plain view.
[00:01:26.103 --> 00:01:28.904]  And that is the economic takeover
[00:01:32.927 --> 00:01:36.149]  Of this country.
[00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:45.155]  This morning, I had just an intense understanding.
[00:01:45.155 --> 00:01:54.001]  And yesterday on the radio, during the Sunday broadcast, I had
[00:01:57.014 --> 00:01:59.336]  An epiphany on this subject.
[00:01:59.336 --> 00:02:04.342]  And it's something we've actually stated over and over again on air.
[00:02:04.342 --> 00:02:11.349]  But the magnitude of it hit me like a ton of bricks yesterday evening on the Sunday radio show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.070]  Central.
[00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.754]  And then the magnitude this morning hit me so hard.
[00:02:16.754 --> 00:02:20.178]  There's that saying, that common saying that, and then it hit me.
[00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.660]  I woke up.
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.222]  It hit me.
[00:02:25.222 --> 00:02:26.523]  Suddenly it all became clear.
[00:02:26.523 --> 00:02:34.089]  And it was clear before, but now it's so incredibly clear, it boggles the mind.
[00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:44.957]  Have you ever looked into a mountain stream that's still, and it's so clear, it almost makes the things on the bottom look even more clear than if it was just air you were looking through?
[00:02:44.957 --> 00:02:51.443]  It's like the water magnifies it to a crystal clear magnification.
[00:02:53.735 --> 00:02:59.159]  I'm not even going to say what it is until we come back on the other side of this break.
[00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.561]  We're going to get into the government shutdown.
[00:03:01.561 --> 00:03:03.722]  That's the heart of it.
[00:03:03.722 --> 00:03:13.089]  But I even meant to get into the office early today and write some notes along these points, and I had time to do some of that.
[00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:19.894]  But mainly, we just pulled articles to back up what I'm going to be talking about here.
[00:03:19.894 --> 00:03:21.355]  But this is the biggest
[00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.111]  Most important thing that I have ever covered.
[00:03:27.111 --> 00:03:27.651]  Undoubtedly.
[00:03:27.651 --> 00:03:32.473]  And you'll notice, if you were a listener 15, 16, 17, 18 years ago, I would never really talk like that.
[00:03:32.473 --> 00:03:36.114]  And then, maybe once a year, I'd say, this is the most important news we ever covered.
[00:03:36.114 --> 00:03:38.275]  Because things just get crazy as time goes on.
[00:03:38.275 --> 00:03:40.656]  And then, once every six months, I'd say it.
[00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:41.796]  Then every month.
[00:03:41.796 --> 00:03:42.917]  And now every couple weeks.
[00:03:42.917 --> 00:03:44.738]  And now every day.
[00:03:44.738 --> 00:03:49.079]  It's just accelerating in a quickening here.
[00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.220]  But it all just hit me
[00:03:52.885 --> 00:03:56.989]  Like a battering ram upside the head.
[00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.851]  But not a battering ram that knocks you down and stuns you.
[00:03:59.851 --> 00:04:11.102]  A battering ram that knocks you into full crystal clear understanding of the entire compendium of the globalist operation on their plan.
[00:04:12.088 --> 00:04:16.794]  And then you can go out and see in their own statements every piece of that compendium.
[00:04:16.794 --> 00:04:20.618]  It's not just like I'm sitting back recognizing it and seeing it.
[00:04:20.618 --> 00:04:22.701]  They're all admitting it.
[00:04:22.701 --> 00:04:27.607]  But still, one staggers.
[00:04:27.607 --> 00:04:30.991]  It staggers the mind to see them really doing it.
[00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.232]  And to realize how much trouble we're in.
[00:04:35.232 --> 00:04:56.445]  But the minute we fully realize just how serious this is, and just how criminal these people are, and that they're not going to give us quarter, that is a great moment of victory, and we turn the tide at that point, because then you realize they are predatory, they are the enemy, they are not going to stop, and all we can do is stand up against them and not have fear.
[00:04:56.445 --> 00:04:57.186]  It comes down to that.
[00:05:00.697 --> 00:05:06.202]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[00:05:06.202 --> 00:05:10.025]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[00:05:10.025 --> 00:05:13.448]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[00:05:13.448 --> 00:05:16.911]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[00:05:16.911 --> 00:05:23.517]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[00:05:23.517 --> 00:05:26.960]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:39.016]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[00:05:39.016 --> 00:05:43.983]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[00:05:44.483 --> 00:05:52.607]  To find out more information on how Supernatural Silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens, go to SupernaturalSilver.com.

[00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:03.713]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[00:07:03.713 --> 00:07:10.099]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:16.484]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[00:07:16.884 --> 00:07:19.166]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[00:07:19.166 --> 00:07:20.507]  They're the good guys.

[00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:24.354]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:24.354 --> 00:08:31.558]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:31.558 --> 00:08:37.901]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we are live broadcasting worldwide on this 30th day of September, 2013, Geraldo Rivera
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:47.465]  Is scheduled to be coming on the broadcast to talk about world events, Syria, the economy, government shutdown, you name it.
[00:08:47.465 --> 00:08:49.967]  Sometime in the third hour today.
[00:08:49.967 --> 00:08:55.632]  Dr. Jerome Corsi's been set up for weeks to come on about his new book about 50 years after who really killed JFK.
[00:08:55.632 --> 00:09:03.198]  We know it was a conspiracy, but he's tied it down to who really did it and it concurs with my deep research and analysis on the subject.
[00:09:03.198 --> 00:09:07.282]  But we're going to spend about 30 minutes with Corsi on that, the first 30 minutes on world news up front.
[00:09:08.123 --> 00:09:18.325]  I'm going to get into the government shutdown that we're like 15 hours out from, and the fact that it's not really a government shutdown, coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:09:18.325 --> 00:09:30.108]  And I will be covering the government shutdown when I get into this news here in just a moment, but I will specifically look at the Obamacare and the so-called shutdown at the bottom of the hour.
[00:09:30.108 --> 00:09:33.929]  To cover something of the magnitude that I'm about to discuss,
[00:09:35.683 --> 00:09:37.543]  Is very hard to do.
[00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:40.024]  Because there's so much proof.
[00:09:40.024 --> 00:09:45.365]  It's like closing arguments in a murder trial.
[00:09:45.365 --> 00:09:51.526]  And the murderer has been caught with a hundred dead bodies buried in their basement of little children.
[00:09:51.526 --> 00:09:55.707]  And shot hundreds of hours of video of them torturing the children.
[00:09:55.707 --> 00:10:00.447]  And it's hands down an absolute fact this person should go to the electric chair.
[00:10:00.447 --> 00:10:03.348]  This is the analogy of the globalist being the killer.
[00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:11.214]  But if we don't follow all the procedures correctly, they'll get off on a technicality.
[00:10:11.214 --> 00:10:13.115]  And that's why I say I don't feel like I'm worthy.
[00:10:13.115 --> 00:10:17.018]  It's why I say I don't want people calling and telling me how great I am.
[00:10:17.018 --> 00:10:21.461]  Because sometimes I do have moments of clarity and moments of great understanding.
[00:10:21.461 --> 00:10:29.827]  But most of the time, it's the opposite.
[00:10:29.827 --> 00:10:29.947]  And
[00:10:31.368 --> 00:10:43.275]  I don't want to just get up here and run through all these facts and have it just go out there into the ether and bounce off of people and not have an effect.
[00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:50.100]  I need you, the listeners of this radio show, to listen very carefully to what I'm going to say in the next 30 minutes.
[00:10:51.388 --> 00:10:54.172]  I need you to write notes on what I'm going to say.
[00:10:54.172 --> 00:11:04.505]  I need you to go to the news articles and documents I'm going to be showing you and read them for yourself so that you know that I'm telling you the truth.
[00:11:04.505 --> 00:11:07.269]  And then I need you to take action on this information.
[00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:24.957]  I talked about what you're about to hear, the report I'm about to give you, the briefing I'm about to give you, on the show for about 10 minutes last night, the Sunday broadcast, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:11:24.957 --> 00:11:38.605]  And it hit me really hard during the show, looking at the government shutdown, what it really was, and then it hit me this morning, the strongest I've ever been hit with understanding that I need to focus on this.
[00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:56.036]  And I told my reporters this morning, the news reporters, the print reporters, everyone, I said, I want in the next week, the next month, the next year, you to hammer every angle of what I'm about to cover here.
[00:11:56.036 --> 00:12:08.200]  And we need all the other reporters out there, whether you're establishment mainstream, or whether you're local talk radio, or whether you're print, whether you call yourself a liberal or conservative, a libertarian,
[00:12:09.358 --> 00:12:18.764]  A communist, whatever it is, if you really care about reality, you need to listen to me very, very carefully.
[00:12:18.764 --> 00:12:23.848]  You know, a lot of people are on a power trip, or a lot of people are on an insecure trip.
[00:12:23.848 --> 00:12:31.733]  A lot of people think their whole life is about their ego itself, not about being part of the human community and striving to build something better.
[00:12:31.733 --> 00:12:34.415]  But I realized this weekend, I'm on a reality trip.
[00:12:36.752 --> 00:12:40.234]  And I want you to join me on a reality trip.
[00:12:40.234 --> 00:12:44.437]  There is no rest for those of us that really seek after reality.
[00:12:44.437 --> 00:12:55.785]  Not what we want to believe, not what, you know, all the propaganda, they give us different flavors so we can choose which flavor of globalist cyanide-laced Kool-Aid we want to drink.
[00:12:55.785 --> 00:13:02.109]  You know, there's 20 different flavors of Kool-Aid, but they're all laced with cyanide in this New World Order.
[00:13:02.109 --> 00:13:02.649]  A.K.A.
[00:13:02.649 --> 00:13:03.230]  Jim Jones.
[00:13:05.816 --> 00:13:09.658]  And I've really been braced by the fact of just how accurate we've been.
[00:13:09.658 --> 00:13:12.340]  But of course we've been accurate.
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:29.849]  Because the globalists have hidden, in plain view, in Council on Foreign Relations publications, and Club of Rome statements, and Davos statements, and leaked Bilderberg documents, and C-SPAN conversations, and Rand Corporation programs.
[00:13:29.849 --> 00:13:31.090]  Rand Corporation said in 1998,
[00:13:33.097 --> 00:13:35.239]  It was in the Austin American States, put an article about it.
[00:13:35.239 --> 00:13:39.402]  I went to the library, actually pulled the full report.
[00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:42.344]  And they said, we're going to have troops on every checkpoint.
[00:13:42.344 --> 00:13:45.146]  We're going to have tanks going up and down the road, armored vehicles.
[00:13:45.146 --> 00:13:47.227]  We're going to arrest people for their free speech.
[00:13:47.227 --> 00:13:49.649]  We're going to federalize all local police.
[00:13:49.649 --> 00:13:50.830]  We're going to take everybody's liberties.
[00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:55.253]  And here's Fox News today.
[00:13:55.253 --> 00:13:55.573]  U.S.
[00:13:55.573 --> 00:13:58.455]  police obtaining military vehicles to aid hunt for criminals.
[00:13:58.455 --> 00:14:01.938]  Giant homeland security armored vehicles used in Iraq.
[00:14:02.952 --> 00:14:05.033]  Dallas is getting scores of them.
[00:14:05.033 --> 00:14:10.316]  They're producing about 7,000 a year of just one brand to be deployed to local police.
[00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:14.858]  They're gearing up for all-out war with the American people, folks.
[00:14:14.858 --> 00:14:20.201]  These are armored vehicles that can take five pounds of C4 detonating under them.
[00:14:20.201 --> 00:14:22.842]  They are preparing for all-out war with us, folks.
[00:14:22.842 --> 00:14:25.023]  And you better ask yourself why.
[00:14:25.023 --> 00:14:31.066]  Second Command of the country's nuclear arsenal is suspended as he is investigated for gambling.
[00:14:31.066 --> 00:14:31.927]  You really believe that?
[00:14:33.766 --> 00:14:39.748]  No, there's coup d'etat going on in the government, and they're going after anybody who won't play a ball with them.
[00:14:39.748 --> 00:14:54.475]  We are on the razor's edge, ladies and gentlemen, of a hot war with the globalists that have occupied the United States.
[00:14:54.475 --> 00:14:55.075]  Let me now
[00:14:57.679 --> 00:15:00.460]  Let me now break down the betrayal.
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.921]  Let me now break down what we're really facing.
[00:15:02.921 --> 00:15:15.006]  Let me now, as best I can, as simply as I can, and then go in and fill in all the documentation, tell you what's happened.
[00:15:15.006 --> 00:15:17.527]  And for many of you, you'll say, we already know that.
[00:15:17.527 --> 00:15:18.288]  You've said this for
[00:15:19.715 --> 00:15:21.496]  18 years, we've been saying it forever.
[00:15:21.496 --> 00:15:23.116]  Ron Paul's pointed it out.
[00:15:23.116 --> 00:15:24.897]  The globalists have bragged about it.
[00:15:24.897 --> 00:15:29.579]  They get up on CNBC and say we've been occupied and conquered by international banks.
[00:15:29.579 --> 00:15:33.961]  Aren't we all just slaves to the Federal Reserve?
[00:15:33.961 --> 00:15:38.362]  But that has to hit home and realize that's not hyperbole.
[00:15:38.362 --> 00:15:40.463]  That's not exaggeration.
[00:15:40.463 --> 00:15:44.925]  Like a bullet to the brain, we've got to really get this with clarity.
[00:15:46.749 --> 00:15:50.513]  It's got to really drill into there that this is real.
[00:15:50.513 --> 00:15:54.396]  They're not going to let any private individual companies operate.
[00:15:54.396 --> 00:15:56.639]  They're not going to let you have a family business.
[00:15:56.639 --> 00:15:58.540]  They're not going to let you live your life.
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.764]  They're going to break us and fully collectivize us.
[00:16:01.764 --> 00:16:05.047]  And how they're going to do that is the same way they've done it everywhere else.
[00:16:05.047 --> 00:16:07.609]  And that's the big epiphany.
[00:16:07.609 --> 00:16:11.213]  We know the globalist
[00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:29.579]  Put the Communist Chinese in power, shipped most our jobs over there to leverage out Western economies and de-industrialize us so that then people can only work for government or select corporations that got government contracts to create a command and control economy for total control.
[00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:32.100]  But we're now entering the endgame
[00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:33.910]  Of course.
[00:16:47.529 --> 00:16:49.030]  It's been done to Greece.
[00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.653]  It's been done to Iceland, who's been fighting back.
[00:16:52.653 --> 00:16:54.495]  This is the same plan.
[00:16:54.495 --> 00:16:55.535]  Here's an example.
[00:16:55.535 --> 00:17:01.040]  Back in the 1970s, you can look it up, they gave a billion-dollar IMF World Bank loan to Nigeria.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:12.589]  Last time I checked, Nigeria had paid back more than $40 billion of it and still owed close to $100 billion more with all their different debts on a billion-dollar loan.
[00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:15.852]  It makes loan sharking look tame in comparison.
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.440]  Look at Greece.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.441]  They're signed on to the globalist derivatives.
[00:17:21.441 --> 00:17:23.701]  Hundreds of billions just for their little country.
[00:17:23.701 --> 00:17:28.642]  Ninety plus percent of it on record isn't their debt.
[00:17:28.642 --> 00:17:30.542]  They're signed on to it.
[00:17:30.542 --> 00:17:39.424]  And the very bankers who they're propping up then come in and raise the taxes, implode the economy to further destroy it to then buy everything up for pennies on the dollar.
[00:17:39.424 --> 00:17:45.965]  And they have big symposiums in Athens with world leaders bragging they're ripping everyone off.
[00:17:45.965 --> 00:17:46.925]  They don't even hide it.
[00:17:50.038 --> 00:17:54.963]  And that's the big epiphany here, is that we all need to have the epiphany.
[00:17:54.963 --> 00:18:01.509]  We need to have the awakening and really understand that just because we've known incrementally this was coming, now it's here.
[00:18:01.509 --> 00:18:12.159]  Just like in 2008, in October, they said, you will give unlimited trillions of dollars to offshore private banks, and Congress can't see who's getting it.
[00:18:12.924 --> 00:18:17.327]  Under the banker bailout, the first round was 800 plus billion.
[00:18:17.327 --> 00:18:23.532]  It turned into 40 plus trillion last time Bloomberg broke the numbers down in one form or another of looting.
[00:18:23.532 --> 00:18:26.474]  That's four or five times the GDP in a year.
[00:18:26.474 --> 00:18:32.059]  I mean, they are robbing us to destroy us.
[00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.193]  They can't even spend or use all this.
[00:18:35.193 --> 00:18:37.494]  What they're doing will wreck the world economy.
[00:18:37.494 --> 00:18:40.375]  It is a blitzkrieg economic attack.
[00:18:40.375 --> 00:18:42.375]  It's economic scorched earth.
[00:18:42.375 --> 00:18:43.776]  It's been done in Mexico.
[00:18:43.776 --> 00:18:45.456]  It's done every decade there or so.
[00:18:45.456 --> 00:18:46.477]  It's been done everywhere.
[00:18:46.477 --> 00:18:50.518]  This is what the globalists do to countries.
[00:18:50.518 --> 00:19:00.141]  And this is what Joe Stiglitz exposed when he left the World Bank back in 2002 and thousands of pages of documents got leaked.
[00:19:00.141 --> 00:19:01.802]  He's a Nobel Prize winner for economics.
[00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:12.353]  That they were then planning to implode Western Europe, the US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Western nations, the same way they've done the third world.
[00:19:12.353 --> 00:19:16.515]  So that's even in my book, Descent into Tyranny, that's been out of print for five years.
[00:19:16.515 --> 00:19:19.697]  You can read it online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:19:19.697 --> 00:19:24.300]  That interview, the transcript, the documents, 2002 is when that book came out.
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.821]  So you're saying, well Alex, we already know this.
[00:19:25.821 --> 00:19:26.301]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:19:27.443 --> 00:19:32.006]  The point is, is that they know you're awake to banker bailouts.
[00:19:32.006 --> 00:19:37.109]  Direct taxes to private banks show the banks own the big insurance companies on average.
[00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:45.334]  Obamacare is another direct tax, rule to direct tax, to the banks through the insurance companies as another looting program.
[00:19:47.153 --> 00:19:50.175]  And then when they hold us hostage and say the faith and credit of the U.S.
[00:19:50.175 --> 00:19:56.118]  will be destroyed, if you don't give in to this, they're treating us just like a third world country who's being held hostage.
[00:19:56.118 --> 00:19:58.400]  And that's the big key when we come back.
[00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:01.675]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:01.675 --> 00:20:06.017]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:06.017 --> 00:20:11.879]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:11.879 --> 00:20:15.460]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.140]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:23.102]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:20:23.102 --> 00:20:23.342]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:23.342 --> 00:20:24.702]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:29.844 --> 00:20:39.147]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:39.147 --> 00:20:39.927]  This capitalism?
[00:20:39.927 --> 00:20:46.110]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:49.791]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:20:49.791 --> 00:20:50.711]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:20:50.711 --> 00:20:52.132]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:20:52.132 --> 00:20:52.452]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:52.452 --> 00:20:52.732]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:59.514 --> 00:21:04.676]  We travel so much and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[00:21:04.676 --> 00:21:14.318]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[00:21:14.318 --> 00:21:26.242]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[00:21:26.562 --> 00:21:31.125]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet, just like a light on a timer.
[00:21:31.125 --> 00:21:32.927]  And they're so easy to use.
[00:21:32.927 --> 00:21:34.848]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[00:21:34.848 --> 00:21:38.851]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[00:21:38.851 --> 00:21:42.393]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping.

[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:04.547]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:23:04.547 --> 00:23:11.936]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:23:11.936 --> 00:23:15.260]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.022]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:23:17.262 --> 00:23:21.924]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:23:21.924 --> 00:23:24.825]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:23:24.825 --> 00:23:30.788]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:23:30.788 --> 00:23:34.469]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:23:34.469 --> 00:23:39.712]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:23:39.712 --> 00:23:42.673]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:23:42.893 --> 00:23:48.878]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[00:24:15.385 --> 00:24:20.206]  Alright, I told you that I had an epiphany.
[00:24:20.206 --> 00:24:40.852]  And the epiphany, the ton of bricks that hit me this morning, is that we can beat these people if, and only if, we can get the truth out to the American people that we really are occupied, and that the occupiers want to impoverish us as a tool of political control.
[00:24:42.697 --> 00:24:44.378]  And that was really it.
[00:24:44.378 --> 00:24:51.461]  Watching Fox, CNN, MSNBC over the weekend, reading hundreds of news articles on the government shutdown.
[00:24:51.461 --> 00:25:07.608]  The talking point is, you give us Obamacare, and you do what you're told, or we'll lose our faith and credit, and the Communist Chinese that own and run America, along with the private offshore Federal Reserve, that's a foreign bank.
[00:25:07.608 --> 00:25:08.909]  The shareholders are mainly European.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:22.325]  We will shut the economy down, just like Henry Paulson threatened to do back in 2008, and that foreign interests are holding America hostage, just like we're Mexico, or Brazil, or Nigeria.
[00:25:23.482 --> 00:25:37.236]  Just like we're Greece, and foreigners come in, foreign corporations, and get their private islands, and get their state parks, and their national parks, and their infrastructure, and their roads, and their water factories, and their power plants.
[00:25:37.236 --> 00:25:40.439]  The whole infrastructure is being looted out to globalists.
[00:25:42.153 --> 00:25:52.417]  Not to just steal it and control it, but to steal it and control it and double, triple prices to impoverish us, to convert us to debtor slaves as a political tool of control.
[00:25:52.417 --> 00:26:04.281]  I mean, this isn't just like some foreign enemy that invades and takes over your government so they run things and puts a puppet in charge so that, you know, at least the local viceroy is, say, Indian, and you're in India.
[00:26:04.901 --> 00:26:11.824]  This is foreign megabanks with paramilitary police in place for the American people, not for Al Qaeda.
[00:26:11.824 --> 00:26:16.125]  They say it's for gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, anti-federal reserve people.
[00:26:16.125 --> 00:26:17.886]  Folks that know America's occupied.
[00:26:17.886 --> 00:26:23.388]  TV shows, movies, dramas, cartoons, demonizing the founders, gun owners.
[00:26:23.388 --> 00:26:27.609]  Armored vehicles, SWAT teams everywhere preparing for war with us.
[00:26:27.609 --> 00:26:29.390]  The good news is it's been waking up the SWAT teams.
[00:26:30.629 --> 00:26:35.111]  Because they're going, we're training that Americans are bad, and I thought this was for Al-Qaeda.
[00:26:35.111 --> 00:26:39.312]  You see, this is a total takeover, folks.
[00:26:39.312 --> 00:26:47.735]  And it's the bankers that took over America, the robber barons a hundred plus years ago, that set up the Federal Reserve, that set up the UN, to be their international takeover arm.
[00:26:49.246 --> 00:26:50.807]  They already took America over.
[00:26:50.807 --> 00:26:54.109]  Now they're taking the world over with our money, our military.
[00:26:54.109 --> 00:26:57.071]  But now they don't want to just run the banks and the government.
[00:26:57.071 --> 00:26:59.172]  They want to run everything.
[00:26:59.172 --> 00:27:00.333]  They want to run your life.
[00:27:00.333 --> 00:27:04.395]  They're saying, hey, your kids don't belong to you on the news every day.
[00:27:04.395 --> 00:27:06.456]  They're saying, we're going to teach your kids what we want.
[00:27:06.456 --> 00:27:11.319]  We're going to teach five-year-olds how to have anal sex and how to masturbate at school.
[00:27:11.319 --> 00:27:14.721]  And if you call it pedophilia, we'll arrest you.
[00:27:14.721 --> 00:27:16.842]  Because if they can get away with that, they can get away with anything.
[00:27:16.842 --> 00:27:18.003]  They're setting the precedent.
[00:27:19.793 --> 00:27:22.694]  And I just realized, man, they really are going to come after everybody.
[00:27:22.694 --> 00:27:24.195]  We really have been right.
[00:27:24.195 --> 00:27:27.896]  The worst case scenario is 100% certified.
[00:27:27.896 --> 00:27:32.038]  We are in a world of you-know-what.
[00:27:32.038 --> 00:27:37.100]  And the only way out of it is to speak out and get really aggressive and stop complying.
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:46.463]  And also, folks, prepare to defend ourselves, because there's a good chance they'll nuke a city or blow up federal buildings and try to arrest, you know, thousands of leaders and go after people.
[00:27:46.463 --> 00:27:48.704]  And if they convert that sweep,
[00:27:49.702 --> 00:27:51.163]  Then Katy, bar the door, folks.
[00:27:51.163 --> 00:27:52.384]  They're coming for you next.
[00:27:52.384 --> 00:27:55.466]  And I wouldn't want to be the military and police, by the way.
[00:27:55.466 --> 00:28:00.008]  You guys are smart enough to know the globalists want to destroy you in the war with us.
[00:28:00.008 --> 00:28:03.771]  It's full-spectrum dominance, just like it's Shiite and Sunni to kill each other.
[00:28:03.771 --> 00:28:06.352]  Patriot and paramilitary to kill each other.
[00:28:06.352 --> 00:28:14.817]  Why don't we join forces against the New World Order and just speak out against it and they will grind like a tank in the mud.
[00:28:14.817 --> 00:28:17.039]  Like Barbarossa in the mud, right at Leningrad.
[00:28:20.776 --> 00:28:25.478]  But I'm telling you right now, ladies and gentlemen, you've got to realize how life and death this is.
[00:28:25.478 --> 00:28:29.779]  I mean, my life is just electric now.
[00:28:29.779 --> 00:28:30.939]  I'm not even scared.
[00:28:30.939 --> 00:28:34.421]  I'm on the front lines of this war for Western civilization and freedom.
[00:28:34.421 --> 00:28:35.681]  I'm aware of it.
[00:28:35.681 --> 00:28:37.642]  I have no fear.
[00:28:37.642 --> 00:28:40.983]  Only that I won't execute properly and resist these people properly.
[00:28:42.793 --> 00:28:44.894]  I feel like I've aged 20 years, not in a bad way.
[00:28:44.894 --> 00:28:46.394]  I feel like an old man now.
[00:28:46.394 --> 00:28:57.819]  My wisdom has just massively increased because I've fully faced reality, folks, and that's when everything connects and the understanding intensifies because you're not giving your brain bad data anymore.
[00:28:57.819 --> 00:28:59.300]  You're not living in fear anymore.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:03.201]  You're not clouding things with what you wish things would be like.
[00:29:03.201 --> 00:29:07.883]  You're just seeing it cold for what it is, and man, it is incredible!
[00:29:10.049 --> 00:29:15.971]  These occupiers, the people that have captured America, plan on absolutely shutting it down.
[00:29:15.971 --> 00:29:25.095]  And they're shutting down healthcare, industry, businesses, farming, the farmers, the people in healthcare, the people in industry, every factory, business, restaurant.
[00:29:25.095 --> 00:29:29.397]  There are government inspectors and harassers shutting everyone down everywhere.
[00:29:30.137 --> 00:29:35.201]  I mean, in my own personal life, they are just shutting this country down.
[00:29:35.201 --> 00:29:36.742]  They are strangling it.
[00:29:36.742 --> 00:29:41.545]  Just like they shut down with bureaucrats Poland and Ukraine under communism.
[00:29:41.545 --> 00:29:44.207]  For a decade to make them go to their knees.
[00:29:44.207 --> 00:29:49.750]  They are just strangling America right now, and I'm going to tell you how to stop them straight ahead.
[00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.151]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.151 --> 00:29:53.673]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.673 --> 00:29:56.375]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.498 --> 00:30:02.379]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:30:02.379 --> 00:30:06.041]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:30:06.041 --> 00:30:10.564]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:30:10.564 --> 00:30:16.688]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:30:16.688 --> 00:30:27.474]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:30:27.674 --> 00:30:30.537]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates!
[00:30:30.537 --> 00:30:34.161]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:30:34.161 --> 00:30:48.896]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[00:30:49.116 --> 00:30:51.478]  And sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:30:51.478 --> 00:30:56.784]  Get your Pro Pure with the new Pro One filters today at Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:31:00.652 --> 00:31:14.422]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens and parasites.
[00:31:14.422 --> 00:31:24.730]  At Silver Lungs, we have developed a reliable and easy-to-use full production system for creating endless pure nano-silver solutions right from the convenience and comfort of your home.

[00:31:54.742 --> 00:31:57.984]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:32:00.134 --> 00:32:04.016]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:32:04.016 --> 00:32:09.539]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:32:09.539 --> 00:32:17.263]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:32:17.263 --> 00:32:26.388]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:32:26.568 --> 00:32:33.735]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:32:33.735 --> 00:32:36.638]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:32:36.638 --> 00:32:43.565]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[00:32:44.125 --> 00:32:45.086]  Oh, there's another one!
[00:32:45.086 --> 00:32:46.486]  Another plane just hit!
[00:33:15.317 --> 00:33:16.418]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:16.418 --> 00:33:19.280]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.021]  I hear sounds of gunfire at the prison gate.
[00:33:22.021 --> 00:33:23.202]  Are the liberators here?
[00:33:23.202 --> 00:33:28.665]  Do I hope or do I fear?
[00:33:28.665 --> 00:33:32.368]  For my father and my brother it's too late.
[00:33:32.368 --> 00:33:42.114]  But I must help my mother stand up straight.
[00:33:44.093 --> 00:33:46.655]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:46.655 --> 00:33:47.175]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:47.175 --> 00:33:49.857]  We're here live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:49.857 --> 00:33:54.301]  And then of course we come back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:33:54.301 --> 00:33:59.324]  Okay, let me get right to the heart of all this.
[00:33:59.324 --> 00:34:01.846]  Obamacare is a takedown of the economy.
[00:34:01.846 --> 00:34:05.449]  Obamacare is the shutdown of America.
[00:34:05.449 --> 00:34:09.572]  Obamacare is the takedown of one-seventh more of the economy.
[00:34:10.805 --> 00:34:22.473]  And it's also a direct tax, as ruled by the Supreme Court, I told you that before they ruled it that, to private select mega-corporations, mega-banks that own the big insurance companies.
[00:34:22.473 --> 00:34:31.040]  And it allows them to shut down all the other smaller insurance companies, HMOs, and healthcare providers that aren't part of the establishment.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.703]  They savagely, just like under Tyson Chicken in an AP investigation back in 1997,
[00:34:37.384 --> 00:34:45.311]  A small firm could have one chicken violation, Tyson could have 1,100 at one plant, not even get a fine.
[00:34:45.311 --> 00:34:46.372]  It's the same deal.
[00:34:46.372 --> 00:34:49.115]  They are shutting everything down.
[00:34:49.115 --> 00:34:57.662]  A microcosm of that was when they nationalized, globalized, bankerized, with taxpayer money, General Motors.
[00:34:57.662 --> 00:35:01.526]  All over the country, Democratic donors were given
[00:35:03.126 --> 00:35:08.808]  Given people that weren't donors or Republicans, Chevy dealership.
[00:35:08.808 --> 00:35:15.011]  That is, you still own the property and the business, but by the way, as of next month, we'll never deliver you another Chevy.
[00:35:15.011 --> 00:35:20.193]  We're giving this to the Hyundai person next door that's a Democrat.
[00:35:20.193 --> 00:35:22.114]  That's on record!
[00:35:22.114 --> 00:35:24.695]  Folks, this is just hardcore mafia.
[00:35:24.695 --> 00:35:28.296]  Everything you see in movies, like Goodfellas, times a thousand, literally.
[00:35:30.473 --> 00:35:35.520]  And it is the takeover of society at every level.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.803]  And the Republican leadership goes along with it.
[00:35:37.803 --> 00:35:43.572]  They're selling 2, 3, 4, 5 million dollar robots to every major city to disarm imaginary bombs.
[00:35:43.572 --> 00:35:44.152]  They're selling...
[00:35:45.647 --> 00:35:52.730]  One armored vehicle that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, giant armored tanks used in Iraq to every major university.
[00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:55.631]  They're selling to cities like Dallas, dozens of them.
[00:35:55.631 --> 00:35:58.091]  They're training openly for war with us.
[00:35:58.091 --> 00:36:02.973]  And again, it's our money they use to then prepare for war with us.
[00:36:02.973 --> 00:36:08.335]  And then it's all going to be needed because they're going to implode the economy, which then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:36:08.335 --> 00:36:11.376]  And then more of the economy selectively gets sent to them.
[00:36:15.563 --> 00:36:21.490]  Until it's like Soylent Green and, well, you know, you got it really bad, but at least you're a cop and got some authority.
[00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:24.834]  Yeah, your pension fund's gone, but, you know, what are you gonna do?
[00:36:24.834 --> 00:36:28.078]  At least you got a paycheck from the force.
[00:36:28.078 --> 00:36:34.746]  So if you're told to mow people down in Dallas, Texas, who are out there rioting because, you know, there's no food, well, you do it.
[00:36:39.298 --> 00:36:45.441]  And after all, the people rioting didn't save food, didn't fight to have a free country, supported Obamacare.
[00:36:45.441 --> 00:36:51.163]  So, you know, folks will be hiding out in the countryside rooting for the cops when they mow down the hordes of people.
[00:36:51.163 --> 00:36:53.344]  Because it's better than them getting to your neighborhood.
[00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:56.525]  But then the globalists again created this atmosphere.
[00:36:56.525 --> 00:37:01.747]  And they'll get to you in the countryside later, two, three years after the collapse.
[00:37:01.747 --> 00:37:07.730]  They've all computerized and actuaried out what they call the science of government in this program.
[00:37:08.479 --> 00:37:11.501]  Look up the paper, The Science of Government.
[00:37:11.501 --> 00:37:14.442]  Look up companies that say they help with the science of government.
[00:37:14.442 --> 00:37:19.865]  It's all former top DARPA heads and people, with Google and others, all admitting this takeover.
[00:37:21.368 --> 00:37:24.849]  They're going to have an industrialized world behind armored compounds.
[00:37:24.849 --> 00:37:30.871]  You are going to have nothing unless you agree to sterilization and shots and the rest of it.
[00:37:30.871 --> 00:37:32.912]  I mean, this is hell!
[00:37:32.912 --> 00:37:37.493]  A scientifically deployed takeover that this is just the beginning of.
[00:37:37.493 --> 00:37:40.854]  And we're five years, a decade out.
[00:37:40.854 --> 00:37:45.376]  Maybe sooner, depending on how hard we fight, we can hold it back from them actually getting this in place.
[00:37:46.647 --> 00:37:48.469]  We're trying to hold it back.
[00:37:48.469 --> 00:37:49.650]  We've been holding it back.
[00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:55.254]  It's over a decade behind Brzezinski and others say, but here's what I'm trying to get across to you.
[00:37:55.254 --> 00:37:57.016]  This is a scientific takeover.
[00:37:57.016 --> 00:37:58.537]  It's the opposite of prosperity.
[00:37:58.537 --> 00:38:00.439]  Globalism is enslavement.
[00:38:00.439 --> 00:38:01.940]  Globalism is poverty.
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.962]  Globalism is forced sterilization.
[00:38:03.962 --> 00:38:06.884]  Globalism is collectivism for the general public.
[00:38:06.884 --> 00:38:11.108]  Fascism at the top, above the law, with diplomatic immunity.
[00:38:11.108 --> 00:38:14.851]  The New World Order is anathema to prosperity.
[00:38:16.463 --> 00:38:20.506]  It is the enemy of 99.99999% of people.
[00:38:20.506 --> 00:38:27.711]  There's only 6,000 globalist superclass in their own words.
[00:38:27.711 --> 00:38:35.616]  And this system is a war against us that are seen as an infestation on the earth and an emergency plague they've got to take out.
[00:38:35.616 --> 00:38:40.220]  At the top, they believe that they are these military tacticians trying to save the planet.
[00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.001]  And folks, even if that is true,
[00:38:43.775 --> 00:38:49.697]  Even if you go with that debate, understand, you're not part of the winning team here.
[00:38:49.697 --> 00:38:59.981]  There are other ways to off-world the population, undersea programs, clean energies, because while they say they're saving the Earth, getting rid of us, they're blocking clean industrial developments.
[00:38:59.981 --> 00:39:01.281]  They're blocking systems.
[00:39:01.281 --> 00:39:07.003]  They're blocking middle-class population, which then lowers the birth rate to negative.
[00:39:07.915 --> 00:39:17.537]  They're targeting the West more than anybody because they see the West and the system of the West and the high IQ of the West as a threat in their own words.
[00:39:17.537 --> 00:39:26.519]  So even their own claim that they're doing all this to save the Earth is not true because they want nanotech and genetic engineering so they can live longer.
[00:39:26.519 --> 00:39:36.221]  They are just open air in tens of thousands of laboratories, full tilt boogies splicing every plant, animal, insect together open air.
[00:39:38.396 --> 00:39:40.798]  I mean, these people are out of their minds.
[00:39:40.798 --> 00:39:43.320]  I indict the entire power structure.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.381]  You people are decadent.
[00:39:44.381 --> 00:39:45.482]  You're out of your minds.
[00:39:45.482 --> 00:39:51.407]  You're listening to all these scientists that get unlimited funding out of your systems in a big power grab.
[00:39:51.407 --> 00:39:54.990]  There's different sectors competing with each other within the globalist combine.
[00:39:58.134 --> 00:39:59.976]  There's no control.
[00:39:59.976 --> 00:40:05.381]  They're in control of us, they're not in control of themselves, and they're hurtling us off the edge of a cliff.
[00:40:05.381 --> 00:40:17.192]  So I'm ranting here, folks, because when I say I have an epiphany, it's thousands of points together giving me a clear, absolute, crystalline image of exactly what we're facing as a society.
[00:40:18.737 --> 00:40:20.278]  And we are being broken.
[00:40:20.278 --> 00:40:28.064]  We have been occupied in the central power hubs, state government, federal government, regulations, internet, all that.
[00:40:28.064 --> 00:40:33.469]  The family's in deep trouble, society's collapsing, IQs are dropping, cancer rates are exploding.
[00:40:33.469 --> 00:40:36.691]  We're under soft kill right now, but a lower level of it.
[00:40:36.691 --> 00:40:41.475]  Now they think we are like the frog in the pot, where the water gets hot, the frog passes out.
[00:40:41.475 --> 00:40:45.118]  Now they're turning it up on high, thinking we can't get out.
[00:40:46.397 --> 00:40:51.103]  And the frog has kind of passed out for a while, but kind of woke up for a minute.
[00:40:51.103 --> 00:40:52.044]  That's what's happening.
[00:40:52.044 --> 00:40:53.526]  And it realizes it's in trouble.
[00:40:53.526 --> 00:40:55.348]  And the system's like, stay in the water.
[00:40:55.348 --> 00:40:56.590]  I love you, sweetie.
[00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:57.290]  Stay right there.
[00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:58.312]  Don't listen to the extremist.
[00:40:59.662 --> 00:41:09.349]  And we, collectively, are the cells in the frog who want to survive the collective race consciousness of the frog going, I gotta get out, I gotta get out, I gotta get out, I gotta get out!
[00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:18.476]  And they're like, shh, shh, shh, and the armored vehicles and the cameras and the fluoride in the water and all of it, and the dumbing down, just stay in the water, stay in the water, lay back, it's gonna be alright!
[00:41:18.476 --> 00:41:20.758]  We can keep him down on the gurney, keep him down, we've almost got him!
[00:41:22.244 --> 00:41:23.846]  You understand what I'm saying, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:41:23.846 --> 00:41:27.089]  The vampires are all over us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:27.089 --> 00:41:31.494]  And they are trying to suck the last lifeblood out of us, so we pass out and they've won.
[00:41:31.494 --> 00:41:32.935]  And we've got to get up!
[00:41:32.935 --> 00:41:34.917]  We've got to get up, folks!
[00:41:34.917 --> 00:41:36.979]  This is scientifically deployed.
[00:41:36.979 --> 00:41:39.162]  I've probably read a hundred books where they admit all this.
[00:41:39.842 --> 00:41:46.527]  How they're scientifically deploying, how they're gonna soft kill us and dumb us down so we don't notice and can't resist the full takeover.
[00:41:46.527 --> 00:41:47.488]  I mean, it is hellish.
[00:41:47.488 --> 00:41:52.792]  And let me tell people that are military or police, you are the number one enemy once this thing goes through.
[00:41:52.792 --> 00:41:58.817]  You already noticed they've changed the narrative over from Al-Qaeda to veterans, gun owners, and in the internal documents, retired police.
[00:41:58.817 --> 00:42:04.041]  You are absolutely, historically, you know they come after you after they take over.
[00:42:04.041 --> 00:42:05.502]  You are dead.
[00:42:06.323 --> 00:42:13.590]  Bare minimum put on list, everything taken, your pension taken to make you destitute and poor, they're coming after you.
[00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:19.495]  I mean, especially if you're a military person currently or a veteran, you already know this.
[00:42:19.495 --> 00:42:21.737]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a death sentence.
[00:42:21.737 --> 00:42:25.340]  It is a suicide pact to serve these people.
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:32.427]  Every reason of honor and duty and common sense in your family says you must wake up and speak out against this.
[00:42:33.908 --> 00:42:42.630]  Most of you in the last decade have been selected because they think you'll follow orders, they think you're dumb, they think that you're compartmentalized, they think you're on a power trip.
[00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:49.512]  But let me tell you, even if you have a low IQ because of environment and they claim genetics, that's not true.
[00:42:49.512 --> 00:42:55.214]  All the science shows, under crises, not just mammals, not just humans, but other life forms,
[00:42:55.954 --> 00:43:09.117]  Have systems in the mind, in the cells, in the DNA and everything to literally, in a crisis, if you admit you're under attack, you can literally have a brain boost.
[00:43:09.117 --> 00:43:10.757]  That's what this is really all about.
[00:43:10.757 --> 00:43:20.739]  And you're going to have to admit that you've been conned and that you've been, just like Obamacare supporters, have to admit you've been conned and get out of the con if you're ever going to turn this around.
[00:43:20.739 --> 00:43:22.020]  You don't have to be morons.
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:22.760]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:43:23.945 --> 00:43:28.307]  Obamacare website quietly deletes references to free health care law.
[00:43:28.307 --> 00:43:31.429]  Yeah, before the Obamacare site said you'll get your free health care.
[00:43:31.429 --> 00:43:33.890]  Now it says, where can I get my low-cost care?
[00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:39.813]  See, the fix is in, folks.
[00:43:39.813 --> 00:43:46.036]  Now that they've got it through, we're right on the cusp, oh God, by the way, we're going to increase the price.
[00:43:46.036 --> 00:43:49.397]  Oh, by the way, the old charity care you could get, that's gone now.
[00:43:49.397 --> 00:43:51.078]  You will not get free health care anymore.
[00:43:51.078 --> 00:43:52.499]  It's the opposite of what they said.
[00:43:55.535 --> 00:43:59.962]  So let me now get to the heart of everything I've been trying to say here in this first hour today.
[00:43:59.962 --> 00:44:00.904]  Please listen to me.
[00:44:00.904 --> 00:44:08.396]  Please take this recording on podcast or the video of it off PrisonPlanet.tv or off YouTube and get it out to everyone you know.
[00:44:08.396 --> 00:44:09.818]  Please watch the whole thing.
[00:44:11.889 --> 00:44:14.350]  Because what I'm saying is we're in a trap.
[00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:16.290]  We're in a scientific takeover.
[00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:29.074]  And if you admit that and study it and find out I've told you the truth, they morally and culturally cannot complete this takeover if they don't have the support of the people and if you're aware of the occupation.
[00:44:29.074 --> 00:44:32.675]  You are designed to fight a foreign enemy that invades and attacks you.
[00:44:34.095 --> 00:44:36.300]  You're designed to fight a frontal assault.
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:43.035]  You're not designed to fight armies of men in suits that put out propaganda and that manipulate and incrementally take over.
[00:44:44.048 --> 00:44:49.491]  An engineer crisis deposes the savior, always then creating a bigger crisis.
[00:44:49.491 --> 00:44:53.713]  They created the banker bailout, the too-big-to-fail, the derivatives.
[00:44:53.713 --> 00:44:55.594]  They grabbed $47 trillion of U.S.
[00:44:55.594 --> 00:44:59.656]  taxpayer money, gave it to offshore banks on record, won't tell Congress where it went.
[00:44:59.656 --> 00:45:00.456]  Things got worse.
[00:45:00.456 --> 00:45:03.037]  Derivatives are even bigger than they were five years ago.
[00:45:03.037 --> 00:45:08.780]  Now they say, we need Obamacare or the whole world will pull out of their investments here and we'll collapse.
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:09.841]  They're holding us hostage.
[00:45:10.461 --> 00:45:18.287]  The globalists, the IMF, the World Bank, the Federal Reserve, the private banks, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, BRAGG, they control the Communist Chinese Party.
[00:45:18.287 --> 00:45:21.689]  They've made them members of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in China.
[00:45:21.689 --> 00:45:24.631]  The heads of the Communist Party are on the board of directors.
[00:45:24.631 --> 00:45:26.453]  Look it up.
[00:45:26.453 --> 00:45:31.456]  Bank of America, you name it, Wells Fargo, under their Chinese subsidiary names.
[00:45:31.456 --> 00:45:34.098]  They're all a gang on a team together.
[00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:36.540]  And so Forbes gets up the blue-blood Republicans and says,
[00:45:38.151 --> 00:45:39.392]  Ted Cruz, you shut up.
[00:45:39.392 --> 00:45:41.493]  Rand Paul, I got the article right here.
[00:45:41.493 --> 00:45:45.655]  You shut up or China will pull the plug on us.
[00:45:45.655 --> 00:45:47.136]  This is globalism.
[00:45:47.136 --> 00:45:53.119]  This is just how China was dominated with debts 150 years ago by the West and broken up into 10 parts.
[00:45:53.119 --> 00:45:54.499]  This is what's happened to America.
[00:45:54.499 --> 00:45:58.261]  This is what the IMF and the World Bank does to everybody.
[00:45:58.261 --> 00:45:59.042]  But look at Greenland.
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:00.720]  Look at Iceland.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.522]  Iceland said, we don't owe these billions of dollars.
[00:46:03.522 --> 00:46:10.887]  It turns out 90 plus percent of it, just like in the other countries, is foreign debt that you had our ministers sign on to.
[00:46:10.887 --> 00:46:13.768]  We're going to arrest the ministers for fraud.
[00:46:13.768 --> 00:46:16.730]  And it turned out the debt wasn't theirs.
[00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:18.391]  They created the derivatives.
[00:46:18.391 --> 00:46:28.017]  No one's even using them as a ball and chain to tie us to and throw us like Jimmy Hoffa into the Atlantic Ocean.
[00:46:28.017 --> 00:46:29.518]  Do you understand that, folks?
[00:46:32.046 --> 00:46:34.447]  They're not stealing all the money because they want it.
[00:46:34.447 --> 00:46:35.768]  They've got unlimited money.
[00:46:35.768 --> 00:46:37.309]  They control the issuance of it.
[00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:45.472]  They've created a black hole of impossible debt to tie you to it so they can hold you hostage anytime they want and say, give us control of health care.
[00:46:45.472 --> 00:46:47.173]  Give us $47 trillion.
[00:46:47.173 --> 00:46:48.574]  Let us do whatever we want.
[00:46:48.574 --> 00:46:50.955]  Launch a war against this country.
[00:46:50.955 --> 00:46:55.737]  Give us $100 trillion in new taxes, new credit to the private IMF World Bank.
[00:46:55.737 --> 00:46:56.918]  That's Davos three years ago.
[00:46:56.918 --> 00:46:57.598]  Pull that up, folks.
[00:46:59.304 --> 00:47:01.686]  Davos calls for 100 trillion in new credit.
[00:47:01.686 --> 00:47:04.288]  To them, your money.
[00:47:04.288 --> 00:47:09.032]  Give us full control of everything or we'll hammer you.
[00:47:09.032 --> 00:47:16.679]  That's what the IMF and World Bank told Spain, told Greece, told Brazil, told over 100 other third world countries, told India.
[00:47:16.679 --> 00:47:18.981]  Old world countries, they turned into third world countries.
[00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:23.072]  Spain's now at 100% GDP on their debt.
[00:47:23.072 --> 00:47:24.593]  We're almost there.
[00:47:24.593 --> 00:47:32.397]  That's the goal, is to maneuver us into bankruptcy while saying, let us maneuver you into it or we'll drop the hammer on you.
[00:47:32.397 --> 00:47:34.419]  These are financial terrorists.
[00:47:34.419 --> 00:47:35.559]  That isn't rhetoric.
[00:47:35.559 --> 00:47:37.180]  They are terrorists.
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:40.742]  They run the physical terrorist.
[00:47:40.742 --> 00:47:44.805]  There it is, the World Economic Forum says we need 100 trillion more credit.
[00:47:44.805 --> 00:47:46.646]  Click on the Telegraph link right there, the blue link.
[00:47:50.117 --> 00:47:51.638]  Right there, that's the blue link right there, yeah.
[00:47:51.638 --> 00:47:53.098]  I want to show folks that.
[00:47:53.098 --> 00:48:01.882]  I want them to see the London Telegraph headline so it's in their face and so they see it and so they understand it and so they know it.
[00:48:01.882 --> 00:48:04.743]  Alright?
[00:48:04.743 --> 00:48:06.604]  Now, they are maneuvering us
[00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:21.818]  into this, while dangling to people, oh, you don't have jobs, you don't have industry, you can work for $8 an hour at McDonald's, but you'll get free healthcare under Obama, so you're like, well, I want to believe in that, when it's a total con game.
[00:48:21.818 --> 00:48:25.000]  And so here is the $64 trillion point.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.963]  You've got to realize that the enemy is the globalist, they've occupied the country.
[00:48:29.963 --> 00:48:36.247]  Brazil figured this out 10 years ago, threw the IMF and World Bank out, and it's now the success story compared to what they were.
[00:48:37.671 --> 00:48:41.053]  There's a few other countries have thrown them out, like Iceland.
[00:48:41.053 --> 00:48:41.914]  Greece didn't do it.
[00:48:41.914 --> 00:48:44.355]  Let me show you some headlines here if you're a TV viewer.
[00:48:44.355 --> 00:48:49.599]  If Republicans want to shut down Washington, they'll have to ask China's permission first.
[00:48:49.599 --> 00:48:50.499]  Forbes.
[00:48:50.499 --> 00:48:52.761]  And it goes on to brag that China runs America now.
[00:48:52.761 --> 00:48:54.162]  You mean the Communist Chinese.
[00:48:54.162 --> 00:48:58.905]  We are literally run by the Communist Chinese with the private Federal Reserve, Goldman Sachs.
[00:48:58.905 --> 00:49:01.727]  Think of these traitors who maneuvered this through fraud.
[00:49:01.727 --> 00:49:02.727]  It's illegitimate.
[00:49:02.727 --> 00:49:04.228]  We don't owe it.
[00:49:04.228 --> 00:49:04.829]  It's bull.
[00:49:05.669 --> 00:49:08.770]  And they're going to implode us anyways, but slowly.
[00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:13.772]  They want to quietly with a pillow, we never wake up, kill us, instead of have a stand-up fight with these people.
[00:49:13.772 --> 00:49:16.893]  Now you want to just call their bluff and say, go ahead and plunge things.
[00:49:16.893 --> 00:49:18.293]  We're going to arrest all of you.
[00:49:18.293 --> 00:49:20.614]  By the way, they may kill me for stuff like this, folks.
[00:49:20.614 --> 00:49:22.615]  This is the type of leadership that will bring them down.
[00:49:22.615 --> 00:49:23.215]  It doesn't matter.
[00:49:23.675 --> 00:49:26.256]  Quite frankly, if they kill me, it'll only make this info bigger.
[00:49:26.256 --> 00:49:27.337]  That's why they haven't.
[00:49:27.337 --> 00:49:29.298]  They'll kill a million Iraqis for fun, folks.
[00:49:29.298 --> 00:49:30.378]  You think they won't kill me?
[00:49:30.378 --> 00:49:39.702]  They won't kill me, because what I've said is so on target, 100%, it blows their Death Star sky high, if you simply use it and are aware of it.
[00:49:39.702 --> 00:49:42.343]  It's over for them the minute you understand this.
[00:49:42.343 --> 00:49:45.385]  Let me give you some more out here.
[00:49:46.465 --> 00:49:47.366]  Look at this right here.
[00:49:47.366 --> 00:49:49.407]  And again, it isn't just like their boss, Hogg.
[00:49:49.407 --> 00:49:50.848]  They want to wreck everything.
[00:49:50.848 --> 00:49:52.489]  They're not just conquerors.
[00:49:52.489 --> 00:49:53.469]  They were just conquerors.
[00:49:53.469 --> 00:49:54.530]  I wouldn't risk my life.
[00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:57.211]  I would criticize them, but I wouldn't go all out against them.
[00:49:57.211 --> 00:49:59.113]  They're not giving us quarter, folks.
[00:49:59.113 --> 00:50:01.774]  They're not going to quit.
[00:50:01.774 --> 00:50:02.474]  Look at this.
[00:50:02.474 --> 00:50:04.776]  With 11th hour bill, keep the lights on.
[00:50:04.776 --> 00:50:06.377]  Futures tumbles ahead of U.S.
[00:50:06.377 --> 00:50:07.618]  government shutdown.
[00:50:07.618 --> 00:50:08.378]  Oh, see, they're holding.
[00:50:08.378 --> 00:50:11.420]  Oh, see, we didn't do what the bankers wanted.
[00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:12.741]  Oh, the futures are tumbling.
[00:50:12.741 --> 00:50:14.021]  The stock market's tumbling.
[00:50:14.021 --> 00:50:14.882]  Told you this was coming.
[00:50:15.851 --> 00:50:17.011]  This is how they hold us hostage.
[00:50:17.011 --> 00:50:17.592]  Look at this.
[00:50:17.592 --> 00:50:17.872]  U.S.
[00:50:17.872 --> 00:50:19.972]  stock futures sink on shutdown fears.
[00:50:19.972 --> 00:50:21.933]  Market watch.
[00:50:21.933 --> 00:50:25.774]  And then the media, the controlled media will say, the state-run media, oh, it's your fault.
[00:50:25.774 --> 00:50:26.294]  Just like in 08.
[00:50:26.294 --> 00:50:29.235]  And they'll just keep doing this like they've done Greece and everybody else.
[00:50:29.235 --> 00:50:30.816]  Because no one figures it out.
[00:50:30.816 --> 00:50:32.096]  No one says no.
[00:50:32.096 --> 00:50:33.756]  No one gets it.
[00:50:33.756 --> 00:50:36.617]  IMF admits mistakes on Greece bailout.
[00:50:36.617 --> 00:50:40.398]  They said they didn't know it would destroy their economy five times worse.
[00:50:40.398 --> 00:50:41.619]  Oh, they didn't know.
[00:50:41.619 --> 00:50:42.459]  It's their program.
[00:50:42.459 --> 00:50:43.939]  Their own documents are public.
[00:50:43.939 --> 00:50:45.060]  They do this on purpose.
[00:50:45.854 --> 00:50:49.319]  They know Obamacare is going to shut down the economy and blow the engine.
[00:50:49.319 --> 00:50:54.466]  They know harassing factories all over the country is going to shut us down.
[00:50:54.466 --> 00:50:56.449]  That's the plan!
[00:50:56.449 --> 00:50:57.411]  These are criminals!
[00:50:57.411 --> 00:50:58.753]  They're blowing out our engine!
[00:51:00.606 --> 00:51:06.354]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:51:06.354 --> 00:51:13.744]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.

[00:53:11.547 --> 00:53:15.849]  But the big drug companies collect $5 billion in revenue from sales of ED medications.
[00:53:15.849 --> 00:53:17.290]  They don't want my message to get out.
[00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:18.871]  Things are so much better now.
[00:53:18.871 --> 00:53:21.272]  Everything kind of came back overnight.
[00:53:21.272 --> 00:53:23.313]  My girlfriend, very happy.
[00:53:23.453 --> 00:53:26.996]  I purchased your product yesterday and it was fantastic.
[00:53:26.996 --> 00:53:30.579]  I have used your system for about three weeks and I'm already seeing great results.
[00:53:30.579 --> 00:53:41.588]  If you're one of the 52% of men who suffer ED, you must go to my website at GetEDSolutions.com and watch an instant web class that shows you how to get rid of your ED forever from the privacy of your own home.
[00:53:41.588 --> 00:53:45.751]  That's GetEDSolutions.com for an eye-opening web class you can watch instantly.
[00:53:45.851 --> 00:53:55.518]  You'll never be the same, and your wife or girlfriend will thank you because you were smart enough not to just believe the big drug companies, but to find out the truth about ED at GetEDSolutions.com.
[00:53:55.518 --> 00:53:57.539]  That's GetEDSolutions.com.
[00:53:57.539 --> 00:54:00.762]  GetEDSolutions.com.
[00:54:00.762 --> 00:54:11.810]  Way up north to Alaska Way up north to Alaska North to Alaska Go north for us you song
[00:54:17.176 --> 00:54:22.137]  By the way, this global plan has been public for about a hundred years.
[00:54:22.137 --> 00:54:38.821]  I've read the New York Times from 1920s and even before bragging about the plan of the robber barons to internationally create a private corporate government above the law to dominate the nation states and the populations.
[00:54:38.821 --> 00:54:40.101]  It's empire by stealth.
[00:54:41.693 --> 00:54:47.656]  It's basically the British government, British Empire model, but it's a corporate system.
[00:54:47.656 --> 00:54:53.720]  And I know you know that, but we have to get the word out to everyone about this.
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:58.602]  Remember how they gave the Communist Chinese the Panama Canal in an agreement in 1979?
[00:54:58.602 --> 00:55:05.266]  The transfer became official in 1999.
[00:55:05.266 --> 00:55:10.609]  Remember how they gave all the deepwater ports now in the Caribbean and the Pacific to the Communist Chinese?
[00:55:12.011 --> 00:55:17.214]  The giant megaport built on the Pacific side of Mexico.
[00:55:17.214 --> 00:55:20.135]  Communist Chinese government run.
[00:55:20.135 --> 00:55:25.338]  That's because the globalists have made the deal because China had a billion plus slaves.
[00:55:25.338 --> 00:55:28.340]  That's how the globalists see these poor souls.
[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:35.224]  Because they'll put people on drugs and forced abortions in Foxconn labs and have suicide nets.
[00:55:35.224 --> 00:55:40.887]  And if you criticize the government, the police in China cut your genitals off in public.
[00:55:41.653 --> 00:55:42.393]  I'm not kidding.
[00:55:42.393 --> 00:55:42.993]  That's on record.
[00:55:42.993 --> 00:55:43.333]  Look it up.
[00:55:43.333 --> 00:55:48.334]  They have more than 14 suicide vans going 24 hours a day in each major city in China.
[00:55:48.334 --> 00:55:59.396]  And when I call it suicide vans, I mean... I'm getting some audio through here, guys, through a computer.
[00:55:59.396 --> 00:56:01.257]  That's what distracted me.
[00:56:01.257 --> 00:56:03.177]  I'm getting audio pumping through the wall over there.
[00:56:03.177 --> 00:56:07.458]  I don't know what it is, but we'll find out.
[00:56:07.458 --> 00:56:07.718]  Pardon me?
[00:56:10.486 --> 00:56:14.087]  Yeah, it must be my computer.
[00:56:14.087 --> 00:56:17.069]  What an incredible, what an incredible distraction for the show.
[00:56:17.069 --> 00:56:19.770]  We have mobile execution vans.
[00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:25.452]  Just type in mobile execution vans if you want to see that and understand that.
[00:56:25.452 --> 00:56:29.634]  Now, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, this is the authoritarian system.
[00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:38.485]  That the power structure has made a deal with to leverage out the rest of the world.
[00:56:38.485 --> 00:56:40.426]  And China's only one small part of it.
[00:56:40.426 --> 00:56:51.811]  But they come out in the news and say, if you don't do what we want, we're going to implode the economy.
[00:56:51.811 --> 00:56:52.792]  It's your fault.
[00:56:52.792 --> 00:56:53.812]  And then they hold us hostage.
[00:56:53.812 --> 00:56:56.914]  And that's how they've done it to Greece three times the last four years.
[00:56:57.901 --> 00:56:59.823]  It's how they've done it to Spain.
[00:56:59.823 --> 00:57:01.765]  It's how they've done it to everyone.
[00:57:01.765 --> 00:57:10.795]  While they give the infrastructure that America built, just like the 20-plus billion that went to General Motors as the bailout, and then what was their recovery plan?
[00:57:10.795 --> 00:57:14.860]  Moved to Eastern Europe, China, and Brazil.
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:16.882]  Now, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:57:19.597 --> 00:57:27.684]  Look at how the IMF tells the BBC, oh, we didn't know raising taxes that much would stall the economy and hurt them.
[00:57:27.684 --> 00:57:31.787]  Oh, we didn't mean to make things worse when that's always their plan.
[00:57:31.787 --> 00:57:38.132]  IMF admits it misjudged the impact of austerity on Greece, but the answer they want now is even more.
[00:57:38.132 --> 00:57:39.493]  Oh, how sweet.
[00:57:39.493 --> 00:57:41.435]  It's always a mistake when they wreck the country.
[00:57:43.578 --> 00:57:49.700]  Greece may face a gap of 11 billion euros, IMF says, but don't worry, they'll just tax the middle class more.
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:57.383]  Look at this, Spain's public debt to approach 100% of GDP by next year.
[00:57:57.383 --> 00:58:00.044]  Isn't that sweet?
[00:58:00.044 --> 00:58:09.287]  100% of their GDP is debt, and then it turns out most of it, 80 plus percent in Spain, they do have big public debt, 80 plus percent of it is banker derivatives.
[00:58:10.305 --> 00:58:13.787]  Where their private central banks sign them on to the banker's debt.
[00:58:13.787 --> 00:58:23.654]  They sign you on to a debt and then tell you that you're their slave, not to just get money, but to destroy you politically and make you dependent.
[00:58:23.654 --> 00:58:24.995]  So, this is what's happening.
[00:58:24.995 --> 00:58:28.097]  And then there's turmoil in the countries, they call that the IMF riot.
[00:58:28.097 --> 00:58:30.819]  And then they come in and set up a police state on the backs of that.
[00:58:30.819 --> 00:58:36.202]  And this is what they're getting ready to do, big time here in America, while posing as the saviors.
[00:58:36.202 --> 00:58:39.905]  America is occupied by foreign banks, backed by the Communist Chinese.
[00:58:42.967 --> 00:58:43.729]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:43.729 --> 00:58:45.032]  Tell everybody you know to tune in.
[00:58:45.032 --> 00:58:46.115]  This is absolutely key.
[00:58:50.936 --> 00:58:56.460]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[00:58:56.460 --> 00:59:00.263]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[00:59:00.263 --> 00:59:03.686]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[00:59:03.686 --> 00:59:07.148]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[00:59:07.148 --> 00:59:13.773]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[00:59:13.773 --> 00:59:17.196]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[00:59:17.836 --> 00:59:29.242]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[00:59:29.242 --> 00:59:34.185]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[00:59:34.725 --> 00:59:42.850]  To find out more information on how Supernatural Silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens, go to SupernaturalSilver.com.

[01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:11.631]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.631 --> 01:00:13.173]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.173 --> 01:00:17.379]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.379 --> 01:00:21.424]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.351 --> 01:00:42.801]  By the way, I've been talking in the last hour how we've been occupied by the private banks that created the IMF, the World Bank, the UN, and how they maneuver every country towards total bankruptcy to consolidate and take control of the nation.
[01:00:42.801 --> 01:00:44.703]  Their philosophy is eugenics.
[01:00:44.703 --> 01:00:46.884]  Look at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America.
[01:00:46.884 --> 01:00:49.907]  They fund all the fake green groups, all the anti-
[01:00:51.878 --> 01:00:53.820]  Family groups.
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:56.143]  This is the program.
[01:00:56.143 --> 01:00:58.766]  This is the takeover.
[01:00:58.766 --> 01:01:00.628]  This is the plan.
[01:01:00.628 --> 01:01:13.122]  And then what the IMF and World Bank do on record is they take millions of US dollars or euros and loan them at loan sharking rakes of the third world and tell them, here's where you've got to spend your money.
[01:01:14.756 --> 01:01:19.880]  And it's with globalist corporations who then make sure the public never gets any of the wealth.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:21.581]  They don't want any wealth.
[01:01:21.581 --> 01:01:23.583]  They don't want a wealth-driven economy.
[01:01:23.583 --> 01:01:26.105]  They don't want prosperity.
[01:01:26.105 --> 01:01:32.129]  The Federal Reserve always says, we don't want to overheat the economy.
[01:01:32.129 --> 01:01:34.291]  That means they don't want you to get too much wealth.
[01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:38.994]  They don't want to create new waves of middle class, the historic enemy of the robber barons.
[01:01:38.994 --> 01:01:40.755]  And look, everybody already knows all this.
[01:01:41.621 --> 01:01:57.550]  Everybody knows that Russia, when the Soviet Union fell, the very same banksters that had helped put in the communists 80 years before, or 70 years before, that the very same globalists then took over that economy through the IMF and World Bank and looted it.
[01:01:57.550 --> 01:02:01.972]  But the Russians got wise to what was happening and kicked the globalists out.
[01:02:01.972 --> 01:02:07.015]  Now, just a new group of kleptocrats are in charge, but they want actual prosperity
[01:02:09.164 --> 01:02:11.905]  Because they understand that's more to skim off a prosperous group.
[01:02:11.905 --> 01:02:16.045]  They're not as anti-human as the globalists.
[01:02:16.045 --> 01:02:18.846]  And so that's what's going on in Russia right now.
[01:02:18.846 --> 01:02:20.886]  And that's why it's the arch enemy of the banksters.
[01:02:20.886 --> 01:02:22.627]  It's not that I side with Russia.
[01:02:22.627 --> 01:02:26.388]  It's that I side against the globalists occupying anybody.
[01:02:26.388 --> 01:02:31.649]  Whether it's Russia, whether it's Syria, whether it's our republic, it doesn't matter.
[01:02:31.649 --> 01:02:32.509]  That's what's happening.
[01:02:32.509 --> 01:02:35.209]  And that's the big news.
[01:02:35.209 --> 01:02:38.030]  Infowars is able to force stuff into the dominant
[01:02:39.642 --> 01:02:46.885]  We're able to break major news, and we have all the facts in front of us.
[01:02:46.885 --> 01:02:53.267]  Of the IMF World Bank Takeover Plan, of the Joseph Stiglitz documents that were leaked 11 years ago detailing all this.
[01:02:53.267 --> 01:02:55.988]  We've been warning people, now we're here.
[01:02:55.988 --> 01:03:04.130]  We saw a big round of this in 2008, now we're seeing another round of it, and that's what Obamacare is, is a tax to foreign offshore banks.
[01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:05.411]  That's the talking point, the truth.
[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:11.603]  Obamacare is a tax to foreign offer banks that own the insurance companies.
[01:03:11.603 --> 01:03:13.624]  The insurance companies wrote the bill.
[01:03:13.624 --> 01:03:16.345]  The blue bloods at Forbes love looting economies.
[01:03:16.345 --> 01:03:18.106]  They're supporting it.
[01:03:18.106 --> 01:03:20.648]  They're saying that communist Chinese run America.
[01:03:20.648 --> 01:03:21.729]  They own our debt.
[01:03:21.729 --> 01:03:25.211]  Our Congress isn't allowed to not do this.
[01:03:25.211 --> 01:03:27.672]  And they're going to drop the stock market as we told you it's happening.
[01:03:27.672 --> 01:03:29.093]  They're going to drop the futures market.
[01:03:29.093 --> 01:03:32.635]  They're going to hold us hostage and say, you let Obamacare happen.
[01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:40.392]  We don't care if your bill funds the rest of the government, or we're gonna shut everything off.
[01:03:40.392 --> 01:03:41.353]  And we're like, really?
[01:03:41.353 --> 01:03:43.893]  And when that happens, we know who to blame, the globalists.
[01:03:43.893 --> 01:03:46.814]  We're gonna take our country back and have you arrested.
[01:03:46.814 --> 01:03:50.796]  And it doesn't matter if you run to Switzerland or Luxembourg.
[01:03:52.049 --> 01:03:53.851]  Or Norway.
[01:03:53.851 --> 01:03:56.293]  It doesn't matter if you run to the Cook Islands.
[01:03:56.293 --> 01:03:58.095]  It doesn't matter if you run to New Zealand.
[01:03:58.095 --> 01:04:00.437]  We're going to get extradition orders.
[01:04:00.437 --> 01:04:03.260]  And we're going to come and we're going to get you.
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:05.122]  Do you understand that?
[01:04:05.122 --> 01:04:06.923]  You are not going to get away with this.
[01:04:06.923 --> 01:04:09.386]  And they've already figured that out in the last five years.
[01:04:09.386 --> 01:04:12.448]  Most of the smart money's on they're going to fail, at least partially.
[01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:15.872]  That's why all the big money's been running to armored redoubts in the middle of nowhere.
[01:04:16.292 --> 01:04:19.073]  They've been running to places like Romania.
[01:04:19.073 --> 01:04:20.654]  They've been running to places like Hungary.
[01:04:20.654 --> 01:04:22.554]  They've been running to the Transylvanian mountains.
[01:04:22.554 --> 01:04:24.435]  I'm not making this up.
[01:04:24.435 --> 01:04:27.576]  They have been running and hiring private security firms.
[01:04:27.576 --> 01:04:29.116]  You better run!
[01:04:29.116 --> 01:04:30.977]  You miscalculated.
[01:04:30.977 --> 01:04:32.658]  You got too greedy.
[01:04:32.658 --> 01:04:35.098]  You screwed too many people.
[01:04:35.098 --> 01:04:36.379]  And the sleeping giant is awake.
[01:04:36.379 --> 01:04:38.479]  I'm going to get Dr. Corsi's take on this and Obamacare.
[01:04:38.479 --> 01:04:41.941]  Then we're getting into his new book, already a bestseller, Who Really Killed Kennedy?
[01:04:41.941 --> 01:04:42.641]  That's coming up.
[01:04:44.042 --> 01:04:47.647]  But it's just history's happening right now.
[01:04:47.647 --> 01:04:51.211]  And exactly what the globalists have done to everybody else, they're doing to us.
[01:04:51.211 --> 01:04:53.354]  I'm going to recap what I've said in the last hour when we come back.
[01:04:53.354 --> 01:04:55.817]  We go to Dr. Courts to get his take on it and more.
[01:04:55.817 --> 01:04:56.538]  Stay with us.
[01:04:56.538 --> 01:04:57.419]  InfoWars.com.
[01:05:01.209 --> 01:05:04.190]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.

[01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:16.956]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[01:05:17.376 --> 01:05:19.658]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[01:05:19.658 --> 01:05:20.999]  They're the good guys.

[01:06:00.461 --> 01:06:06.263]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:06:06.263 --> 01:06:13.646]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:06:13.646 --> 01:06:17.007]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:06:17.007 --> 01:06:18.768]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:06:19.028 --> 01:06:23.691]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:06:23.691 --> 01:06:26.593]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:06:26.593 --> 01:06:32.557]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:06:32.557 --> 01:06:36.239]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:06:36.239 --> 01:06:41.483]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[01:06:41.483 --> 01:06:44.465]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:44.705 --> 01:06:50.689]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[01:07:00.634 --> 01:07:05.357]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:07:05.357 --> 01:07:06.558]  Why do we have the highest
[01:07:06.578 --> 01:07:14.020]  The highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:15.941]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:07:15.941 --> 01:07:17.581]  We are what we eat.
[01:07:17.581 --> 01:07:22.262]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:07:22.262 --> 01:07:26.484]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:07:26.484 --> 01:07:29.044]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:07:29.044 --> 01:07:34.926]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:11.901]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.901 --> 01:08:13.423]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:17.627]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:21.751]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:35.438 --> 01:08:37.319]  Well, he's been on with us a lot the last month.
[01:08:37.319 --> 01:08:47.403]  That's because when I need to really get some deep geopolitical analysis that I know is no-nonsense and incredibly well-researched and on target, I go to Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:08:47.403 --> 01:08:55.246]  We go to Ray McGovern and other top analysts as well, but Corsi really, over the years, I've gotten to just continually be
[01:08:56.727 --> 01:08:59.810]  Marvel and respect his analysis.
[01:08:59.810 --> 01:09:05.816]  So we're going to look at Obamacare, the shutdown, and at the bottom of the hour, his new book for the balance of the hour.
[01:09:05.816 --> 01:09:08.739]  It's already a bestseller, Who Really Killed Kennedy?
[01:09:08.739 --> 01:09:13.764]  50 Years Later, and that ties into this whole shadow government and what's currently happening right now.
[01:09:13.764 --> 01:09:16.426]  And by the way, we're selling the book, Who Really Killed Kennedy?
[01:09:16.426 --> 01:09:19.730]  50 Years Later, stunning new revelations about the JFK assassination.
[01:09:20.551 --> 01:09:26.650]  Dr. Jerome R. Corsi, PhD, two-time number one New York Times best-selling author.
[01:09:28.086 --> 01:09:30.707]  And every one of his books has been in the top ten.
[01:09:30.707 --> 01:09:31.548]  What a trailblazer.
[01:09:31.548 --> 01:09:32.689]  I'm not kissing his rumpus.
[01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:34.249]  It's just he really knows what he's talking about.
[01:09:34.249 --> 01:09:34.770]  We're honored to have him.
[01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:36.731]  We're going to him here in just a moment.
[01:09:36.731 --> 01:09:44.035]  Speaking of things that are very, very serious, if you go up to my Twitter, Real Alex Jones, I tweeted this out on Saturday because it's so important.
[01:09:44.035 --> 01:09:49.298]  Yale professor Fukushima will threaten humanity for thousands of years.
[01:09:49.298 --> 01:09:50.859]  A Yale professor and many other top
[01:09:51.739 --> 01:10:08.107]  Radiologists and physicists are cautioning the world to wake up from its nuclear slumber and face the severity of the Fukushima radiation crisis, warning that all of humanity will be threatened for thousands of years if the Fukushima Unit 4 pool is not kept cool, which they're having trouble doing.
[01:10:08.107 --> 01:10:14.350]  They're storing all this radioactive waste that is basically set to start exploding again or set on fire.
[01:10:15.976 --> 01:10:19.899]  And the background radiation since the 40s has doubled the Northern Hemisphere.
[01:10:19.899 --> 01:10:24.642]  It's almost gone up another level to a tripling, so it's almost triple.
[01:10:24.642 --> 01:10:26.343]  And folks ask, what do you do?
[01:10:26.343 --> 01:10:27.904]  Well, you can't move to the Southern Hemisphere.
[01:10:27.904 --> 01:10:30.085]  I guess you could if you're retired.
[01:10:30.085 --> 01:10:32.847]  The answer is take nascent iodine.
[01:10:32.847 --> 01:10:34.828]  This is special iodine, folks.
[01:10:34.828 --> 01:10:36.650]  I did research for myself and my family.
[01:10:37.802 --> 01:10:52.468]  And with the medical doctors, and the scientists, and the nutritionists, they kept saying, look, seaweed's great, and the modified one, wonderful from the Southern Hemisphere, other things are wonderful, and we sell that at Infowarshore.com, but it's nascent iodine.
[01:10:53.792 --> 01:10:57.234]  In the entire metabolic system of the body, this is the atomic iodine.
[01:10:57.234 --> 01:11:15.767]  It doesn't mean it has anything radioactive in it, it's just called atomic because it's the pure iodine, not the toxic stuff that's sold at the store, not the rad pills the government pushes, which is good in a radiological event, but for everyday use, for overall health, just across the board, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:11:17.634 --> 01:11:26.846]  Survival Shield from Infowarslife.com, the first in a long line of products that we're developing with Dr. Edward Group and others.
[01:11:26.846 --> 01:11:27.948]  Simply amazing.
[01:11:27.948 --> 01:11:29.990]  I've been taking it for over a month and a half.
[01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:31.192]  My wife is marveling at it.
[01:11:31.192 --> 01:11:34.496]  I'm sure everyone can look at me and see I've lost more weight again.
[01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:38.291]  I'm eating more and taking this and losing weight.
[01:11:38.291 --> 01:11:48.940]  Now that's how it works for me and that's what Dr. Grip said it does for people because the thyroid's regulating the other hormones and the other stuff the body can't break down, the chemical stuff that they sell at the stores and even health food stores.
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:50.342]  This is very hard to get.
[01:11:50.342 --> 01:11:51.343]  This is the raw
[01:11:52.673 --> 01:11:53.654]  Nuclear iodine.
[01:11:53.654 --> 01:11:58.135]  You have to be DEA approved at the plant to even buy this stuff.
[01:11:58.135 --> 01:12:02.137]  By the way, when they bought a bunch and made it for us, the DEA did this.
[01:12:02.137 --> 01:12:05.178]  The point is, is that that's how good it is for your body.
[01:12:05.178 --> 01:12:07.959]  And of course, the drug dealers need it as one of the precursors.
[01:12:07.959 --> 01:12:11.021]  The point is, is that this is so good for your body.
[01:12:12.401 --> 01:12:36.666]  Ladies and gentlemen and we sold out of all of it except about a thousand bottles and it'll be about two weeks till we get more but after those are sold you can still order it'll be a two-week back order maybe a week back order we're not sure the point is is that it's available at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com but the future InfoWarsLife.com will be the main site with all of it and if you go to that address it takes you there
[01:12:37.426 --> 01:12:43.135]  You can also call the toll-free number 888-253-3139.
[01:12:43.135 --> 01:12:45.739]  We bought enough iodine, we thought, to last us two months.
[01:12:45.739 --> 01:12:48.283]  So I'm like, wow, this stuff's so incredible, I need to come out with it.
[01:12:48.283 --> 01:12:52.429]  Because that's what I'm moving into, is doing that, so I can assure it's the very best.
[01:12:53.090 --> 01:13:00.118]  So again, Infowarslife.com Survival Shield Nascent Iodine Dietary Supplement.
[01:13:00.118 --> 01:13:03.122]  Available at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:13:08.985 --> 01:13:12.128]  And again, you'll still be able to continue to order it after it's sold out.
[01:13:12.128 --> 01:13:16.051]  We'll just have a notice there that to expect, you know, two weeks until we're able to ship it out.
[01:13:16.051 --> 01:13:18.813]  So three weeks, probably, after these are sold out.
[01:13:18.813 --> 01:13:22.095]  Infowars, Lifetime, 888-253-3139.
[01:13:22.095 --> 01:13:26.058]  And this isn't just something for your emergency area.
[01:13:26.058 --> 01:13:34.285]  This is something that I personally, and you can go do your own research on it, but I personally have found is the thing hiding in plain view, but not regular iodine.
[01:13:34.705 --> 01:13:46.470]  And of course, consult your physician before you use it, especially if you're nursing, or I guess if you're nursing, I mean, if you're a mother who has a nursing child, or if you're pregnant and things like that.
[01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:48.091]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:13:51.496 --> 01:13:53.837]  All right, shifting gears here, folks.
[01:13:53.837 --> 01:13:58.358]  Geraldo Rivera's coming up sometime in the third hour for the next 45 minutes or so.
[01:13:58.358 --> 01:13:59.838]  We're joined by Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:13:59.838 --> 01:14:06.300]  And before we get into his new book, I want to talk about Obamacare, the government shutdown, the incredible betrayal.
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:09.541]  Does he agree with Mitch McConnell that let it go ahead and go through now?
[01:14:09.541 --> 01:14:10.641]  We tried to stop it.
[01:14:10.641 --> 01:14:13.922]  It's so horrible, it'll discredit collectivists forever.
[01:14:13.922 --> 01:14:15.663]  My point is it'll shut the economy down.
[01:14:16.463 --> 01:14:21.850]  And they'll just use some of their government shutdown to blame the implosion of the economy and blame it on libertarians and conservatives.
[01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:27.597]  Plus it's immoral to let it kind of be a false flag where we let them do it to discredit them.
[01:14:27.597 --> 01:14:29.800]  Because they've done this everywhere else.
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:34.866]  They're going to pose and claim libertarians and republicans blocked it and then it never got implemented right.
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:37.521]  And then fully socialize healthcare.
[01:14:37.521 --> 01:14:41.284]  So, I say do the right thing, justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[01:14:41.284 --> 01:14:59.738]  But separately, and I just spent the last hour on this, what I believe is the key to all this, and I want Dr. Corsi to take on this first, just as during October of 2008, we saw the offshore banks, the Federal Reserve, hold us hostage to get tens of trillions of dollars in bank or bailout money, or they would implode the economy, as Henry Paulson threatened the Congress.
[01:14:59.738 --> 01:15:01.799]  He said, blood in the streets, tanks in the streets.
[01:15:01.799 --> 01:15:03.821]  Well, now the bullets in the tanks are actually delivered.
[01:15:04.881 --> 01:15:06.703]  And Al-Qaeda's not the threat, we're told.
[01:15:06.703 --> 01:15:10.306]  It's conservatives, libertarians, gun owners, in the fetters.
[01:15:10.306 --> 01:15:16.692]  People like Dr. Corsi, myself, WorldNetDaily.com, InfoWars.com, DrudgeReport.com, Ron Paul.
[01:15:16.692 --> 01:15:18.994]  We're the ones in the Southern Poverty Law Center reports.
[01:15:18.994 --> 01:15:20.495]  We're the ones being lied about.
[01:15:20.495 --> 01:15:24.259]  We're the ones MSNBC says is racist with no proof.
[01:15:24.259 --> 01:15:26.241]  You know, if I say somebody's a racist, I'm going to show the clip.
[01:15:27.691 --> 01:15:31.113]  They are coming after us because we know it's a globalist takeover.
[01:15:31.113 --> 01:15:38.538]  We're occupied, captured by the globalists, just as Greece is, just as Iceland was, just as Spain was.
[01:15:38.538 --> 01:15:44.162]  And they always say, give us this new tax, whether it's the bailout or Obamacare, that's a tax to foreign banks.
[01:15:46.661 --> 01:15:52.984]  And of course he can talk about this, he worked at the highest levels of international banking, as a Harvard economist basically.
[01:15:52.984 --> 01:16:04.411]  I want to get his take on this because I believe, I know, if we get the truth out to people, with articles like this one out of Bloomberg, where they're so arrogant,
[01:16:05.231 --> 01:16:13.253]  They come out and say, and there's another one here in Forbes, you gotta ask the communist Chinese if you could have a government shutdown.
[01:16:13.253 --> 01:16:21.374]  And they brag, checkmate, America's occupied by financial and foreign interests, just like a third world country under gunboat diplomacy.
[01:16:21.374 --> 01:16:31.576]  So, if we point out that the Panama Canal, all our infrastructure, General Motors, everything's being transferred to China in a dirty trick by the globalists, who need a home,
[01:16:32.297 --> 01:16:35.350]  And that, you know, Maury Strong and all of them live over there now.
[01:16:37.754 --> 01:16:46.580]  If we point out this double-cross with the IMF, the World Bank, the Saudi Arabians, the Communist Chinese, who already dictate what movies we can put out, just like the Saudi Arabians.
[01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:48.341]  I don't like Israel dictating some of what we do.
[01:16:48.341 --> 01:16:56.247]  I'm not defending Israel, but the point is, no one ever talks about the Chai Koms or the Saudis, and they're the ones always giving me problems.
[01:16:56.247 --> 01:17:00.430]  They're the ones always coming down on me, folks, okay?
[01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:03.232]  They're the ones who are teamed up with the big banks
[01:17:04.386 --> 01:17:06.988]  And these other globalist and European interests.
[01:17:06.988 --> 01:17:10.471]  And it's a bunch of criminals over all these countries teamed up doing it.
[01:17:10.471 --> 01:17:11.732]  So we're going to skip this network break.
[01:17:11.732 --> 01:17:14.394]  This is so important to give Dr. Corsi more time.
[01:17:14.394 --> 01:17:21.820]  But my point is, if we point out Obamacare is a shutdown of America, it's the free market shutdown.
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:25.403]  There is no shutdown of the abominable occupied federal government.
[01:17:25.403 --> 01:17:27.825]  They're not even shutting down all the core stuff.
[01:17:27.825 --> 01:17:31.888]  It is literally a way to make you think that you only survive because of them.
[01:17:32.884 --> 01:17:34.445]  And it makes them the center of attention.
[01:17:34.445 --> 01:17:38.587]  This is how they've taken over Brazil, Nigeria, Greece.
[01:17:38.587 --> 01:17:42.670]  And notice when Greece gave them all the money they wanted, they imploded more.
[01:17:42.670 --> 01:17:45.772]  Notice when France did this, they imploded more.
[01:17:45.772 --> 01:17:47.993]  Notice when Spain did it, they imploded more.
[01:17:47.993 --> 01:17:50.875]  And now the bankers are going to do it to the Western world.
[01:17:50.875 --> 01:17:54.597]  This is so historical, and I wanted Dr. Corsi's take on that.
[01:17:55.417 --> 01:18:19.574]  And where he sees us historically, because I see an awakening, but at the same time, if we don't explain to people that this is a globalist takeover, a war against sovereign nations and individual wealth and private property, if we don't point that out to everyone and point out that Obamacare is a takeover of America and is designed to wreck us and drive us into the welfare rolls as they make tens of millions go on part-time,
[01:18:20.535 --> 01:18:24.418]  The employer mandate, 63% of doctors say they're going to retire early.
[01:18:24.418 --> 01:18:25.639]  My dad is.
[01:18:25.639 --> 01:18:26.400]  I mean, it is.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:27.741]  My dad has been working under 10 years.
[01:18:27.741 --> 01:18:29.382]  He loves being a physician.
[01:18:29.382 --> 01:18:31.504]  Everybody he knows is getting ready to retire.
[01:18:31.504 --> 01:18:32.545]  That's the plan.
[01:18:32.545 --> 01:18:34.907]  So that's a lot I just said, Dr. Corsi.
[01:18:34.907 --> 01:18:37.769]  Some stations, like XM, only joined us the last two hours.
[01:18:37.769 --> 01:18:39.631]  I wanted to recap where we're at.
[01:18:39.631 --> 01:18:41.613]  You've heard the compendium of what I've said.
[01:18:43.264 --> 01:18:45.765]  I mean, I know you're going to agree with me, because I've read your writings and your research.
[01:18:45.765 --> 01:18:46.765]  This is a fact.
[01:18:46.765 --> 01:18:48.205]  But you and I know this.
[01:18:48.205 --> 01:18:51.346]  We need the public to know this, and then get it out to everybody else.
[01:18:51.346 --> 01:19:04.649]  Because from a military and historic and political perspective, when we phrase this right, that it's a foreign occupation, which it is, by suits and UN bureaucrats above the law, backed up by the CHICOMS, it's over.
[01:19:05.049 --> 01:19:11.314]  We've got to get that message out that they're holding us hostage to implode us, not holding us hostage to fix the economy.
[01:19:11.314 --> 01:19:20.421]  And the only way out is to run up the flag of, you know, the black flag of no surrender and charge, you know, damn the maneuvers, go straight at them.
[01:19:20.421 --> 01:19:20.982]  Dr. Corsi.
[01:19:21.826 --> 01:19:23.247]  Well, I agree with you, Alex.
[01:19:23.247 --> 01:19:28.310]  I think we're at a critical point here with the shutdown.
[01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:34.013]  I mean, if Obamacare goes into effect, it is clearly going to wreck the economy.
[01:19:34.013 --> 01:19:36.294]  It's clearly designed to wreck the economy.
[01:19:36.294 --> 01:19:39.416]  That's what people don't understand.
[01:19:39.416 --> 01:19:45.680]  The Democrats had planned this from the beginning to destroy the economy, and by the way, most of the Republicans went along with it.
[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:53.965]  Now, what's happened as it gets closer to implementation and people are realizing how disastrous Obamacare is.
[01:19:53.965 --> 01:19:55.946]  I mean, we list the disasters.
[01:19:55.946 --> 01:19:58.788]  It's making America part-time employed.
[01:19:58.788 --> 01:20:01.169]  It's going to have death panels.
[01:20:01.169 --> 01:20:05.732]  I mean, I began to call it Obamacide, as in homicide.
[01:20:05.732 --> 01:20:10.755]  I mean, the quality of medical care is going to deteriorate rapidly.
[01:20:10.755 --> 01:20:14.158]  The powers that be, the elite, know this.
[01:20:14.858 --> 01:20:18.982]  It's not designed to give universal medical care.
[01:20:18.982 --> 01:20:23.405]  There's going to be as many uninsured under this bill as there were before.
[01:20:23.405 --> 01:20:29.810]  It's just going to deteriorate the quality of health care and put it under government control.
[01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:30.811]  So I agree with you.
[01:20:30.811 --> 01:20:35.415]  The only thing to do at this point is to fight it, not to agree with it.
[01:20:35.415 --> 01:20:39.438]  That's why SMY has a nightly show devoted entirely to New York sports.
[01:20:39.438 --> 01:20:41.140]  Because who cares about coverage from Orange County?
[01:20:41.823 --> 01:20:44.024]  Hey, Doc, I think something launched on your computer.
[01:20:44.024 --> 01:20:48.005]  I had that happen earlier to me.
[01:20:48.005 --> 01:20:49.366]  Go ahead, you're back, sir.
[01:20:49.366 --> 01:20:51.026]  I'm back, okay.
[01:20:51.026 --> 01:20:51.686]  Please continue.
[01:20:51.686 --> 01:20:59.389]  The only thing to do is... The only thing to do is to fight this and to let the government shut down.
[01:20:59.389 --> 01:21:04.631]  The idea of a last-minute fix or the... I mean, this is a game of chicken at this point.
[01:21:04.631 --> 01:21:06.872]  The president thinks that he'll get
[01:21:07.392 --> 01:21:11.456]  His way by refusing to negotiate with the Republicans.
[01:21:11.456 --> 01:21:19.104]  Finally, I think the Tea Party conservatives have gotten through to the Republicans in the House that they're going to lose their seats.
[01:21:19.104 --> 01:21:21.207]  They're going to be voted against.
[01:21:21.207 --> 01:21:24.050]  It's suicide to vote for Obamacare.
[01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:27.613]  Even John Boehner and Mitch Cantor finally got the message.
[01:21:28.274 --> 01:21:36.478]  So a showdown now is inevitable, and I think a showdown is the only possible thing that might save the country from Obamacare.
[01:21:36.478 --> 01:21:47.142]  What Obama's counting on is that the Republicans will lose their nerve, and that he can beat the drums with the mainstream media, causing panic that the government's shutting down.
[01:21:47.142 --> 01:21:55.106]  The truth is, if the government shuts down, most Americans won't feel it at all, and at most it's going to be a minor inconvenience.
[01:21:55.626 --> 01:22:00.170]  Although I'm sure the Obama people will try to make it as painful as possible.
[01:22:00.170 --> 01:22:05.274]  Delays at airports, other closings of public parks, etc.
[01:22:05.274 --> 01:22:14.823]  But I think Americans are going to feel after a short period of time that it's better to suffer this inconvenience and to fight a fight now against Obamacare.
[01:22:14.823 --> 01:22:22.749]  Because if Obamacare gets funded at this point, the possibility of repealing it at a later point is uncertain.
[01:22:23.810 --> 01:22:35.158]  And if the forces that want Obamacare in power, and it's not just Democrats, Democrats, Republicans, I think it's the bankers, it's those who want to control the American economy.
[01:22:35.158 --> 01:22:43.264]  If they win at this point, if Obamacare gets funded and they get through this hurdle, don't count on having another chance to repeal it.
[01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:50.813]  And of course, this is Cloward and Piven 101 here, Dr. Corsi.
[01:22:50.813 --> 01:22:52.734]  Explain to people what Cloward and Piven is.
[01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:58.638]  Well, Cloward and Piven, they were two sociologists who were at Columbia when Obama was supposedly there.
[01:22:58.638 --> 01:23:13.866]  And their whole idea was to create a communist state in which we would move to eliminate private property, go to a collectivism of a Soviet-style government, only by collapsing capitalism.
[01:23:14.446 --> 01:23:25.656]  And their whole idea, cloud and pivot of collapsing capitalism, was to so pile the demands on a social welfare system that eventually the system went bankrupt.
[01:23:25.656 --> 01:23:28.158]  And we're right at that point right now.
[01:23:28.158 --> 01:23:31.681]  We can't really absorb the costs of Obamacare.
[01:23:31.681 --> 01:23:35.664]  You're going to find again, Obamacare is a tax.
[01:23:35.664 --> 01:23:38.667]  That's another thing I think you've got to really understand.
[01:23:38.667 --> 01:23:39.487]  This is a tax.
[01:23:40.248 --> 01:23:41.950]  And it's designed to be punitive.
[01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:53.900]  You're going to find young people who are looking at $300 a month if they want to get insured under Obamacare, when they don't need to have this kind of insurance at this point in their lives.
[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:55.782]  You're not going to find more people being insured.
[01:23:55.782 --> 01:23:57.263]  It's not going to happen.
[01:23:57.263 --> 01:23:59.125]  You're going to find doctors who want to leave.
[01:23:59.125 --> 01:24:02.507]  The healthcare exchanges aren't going to work.
[01:24:03.228 --> 01:24:14.242]  The only people who are going to go to the exchanges are sick and are going to look for insurance that they couldn't otherwise get, which, by the way, will bankrupt the insurance companies who participate.
[01:24:14.242 --> 01:24:19.328]  This thing is a disaster in every scope, but people have got to understand it was meant to be a disaster.
[01:24:20.109 --> 01:24:25.751]  The whole purpose of Obamacare was to implode the American health system.
[01:24:25.751 --> 01:24:26.452]  And that's right.
[01:24:26.452 --> 01:24:42.499]  And Obama, as you know, earlier this year hired the head French economist that helped destroy their economy and bring 100 plus percent taxes on the middle class to collectivize everyone because the top socialists, it all turned out, had Swiss bank accounts and were above the law.
[01:24:42.499 --> 01:24:43.939]  And they didn't even get in trouble.
[01:24:43.939 --> 01:24:45.200]  This is an authoritarian
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:46.721]  Takeover.
[01:24:46.721 --> 01:24:48.843]  They've doubled the number of people on food stamps.
[01:24:48.843 --> 01:24:51.026]  It's set to double again the next five years.
[01:24:51.026 --> 01:24:54.649]  This has been... Obama has been incredibly successful.
[01:24:54.649 --> 01:25:03.559]  He has devastated, with the globalists and the big banks, the country, and the country's on life support right now, and Obamacare is the lethal injection.
[01:25:04.279 --> 01:25:10.786]  And notice that members of Congress are exempted and their staffs exempted from Obamacare.
[01:25:10.786 --> 01:25:12.748]  That should tell everybody something.
[01:25:12.748 --> 01:25:16.291]  And even in this shutdown, guess who's going to get paid?
[01:25:16.291 --> 01:25:18.473]  Members of Congress and their staff.
[01:25:18.473 --> 01:25:27.542]  So, you know, the pain being inflicted by Obamacare is on the American people and the goal is to destroy the middle class.
[01:25:28.423 --> 01:25:34.105]  If we just take a perspective, it used to be that everybody got health insurance who was employed.
[01:25:34.105 --> 01:25:36.626]  You got it as part of your employment package.
[01:25:36.626 --> 01:25:46.689]  Today, we've deteriorated the system so far that not only are you not getting health insurance where you work, your work is being turned into part-time labor.
[01:25:46.689 --> 01:25:51.071]  So you can avoid having to have the health insurance paid by the employer.
[01:25:51.071 --> 01:25:56.293]  And the whole structure is designed to be a warfare against employment.
[01:25:57.253 --> 01:26:05.619]  Pushing more and more people into the hands of government dependency, more and more people in the hands of food stamp and other forms of government checks.
[01:26:05.619 --> 01:26:18.109]  And the government is now going to try to, the Obama administration is going to try to scare everybody that if we don't allow the federal government to continue operating in its huge bloated structure, disaster is going to occur.
[01:26:18.949 --> 01:26:26.094]  I remind everybody that when the sequester hit, there wasn't any disaster, and there won't be any disaster in the government shutdown.
[01:26:26.094 --> 01:26:28.676]  Sure, Dr. Corsi, let me throw this out there at you.
[01:26:28.676 --> 01:26:31.938]  The Weekly Standard pointed out something we've pointed out before.
[01:26:31.938 --> 01:26:36.841]  Obamacare website quietly deleted references to free health care.
[01:26:36.841 --> 01:26:40.884]  They'd done this in emails they were sending out a few months ago, but now it's off the site.
[01:26:40.884 --> 01:26:42.625]  Before it said, where can I get free?
[01:26:43.948 --> 01:26:46.309]  Or low-cost care in my community.
[01:26:46.309 --> 01:26:50.070]  Now it says, where can I get low-cost care in my community?
[01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:52.031]  What about what Mitch McConnell says?
[01:26:52.031 --> 01:26:55.372]  That, oh, let's let it go through, it's so horrible it'll destroy them.
[01:26:55.372 --> 01:26:55.612]  No!
[01:26:55.612 --> 01:27:03.235]  I mean, their constituents, God bless them, are so gullible and uninformed that they're going to end up blaming those of us.
[01:27:04.555 --> 01:27:08.260]  You don't let a train wreck happen so you can blame it on the other side.
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:10.943]  You try to prevent the train wreck from happening.
[01:27:10.943 --> 01:27:12.945]  It's unpredictable.
[01:27:12.945 --> 01:27:19.292]  If Obamacare fails, the opponents of Obamacare are just going to get blamed anyway.
[01:27:20.273 --> 01:27:21.294]  We'll be blamed.
[01:27:21.294 --> 01:27:21.995]  I'll be blamed.
[01:27:21.995 --> 01:27:23.195]  You'll be blamed.
[01:27:23.195 --> 01:27:24.296]  Because we opposed it.
[01:27:24.296 --> 01:27:26.258]  We criticized it.
[01:27:26.258 --> 01:27:28.059]  Mitch McConnell is wrong.
[01:27:28.059 --> 01:27:37.406]  The only thing to do right now is to take a principled stand on this and draw a line and tell the international bankers, tell the federal government, we're tired of it.
[01:27:37.406 --> 01:27:38.527]  Go back, let's go back to
[01:27:39.187 --> 01:27:39.767]  We're good to go.
[01:27:54.835 --> 01:27:58.838]  And there's a point at which we can't continue buying our own debt, and the government knows it.
[01:27:58.838 --> 01:28:07.063]  And instead of them holding us hostage and maneuvering us into a thing where they're in control, when they pull the plug either way, they're the authors of the whole thing.
[01:28:07.063 --> 01:28:14.888]  They're the ones that get in trouble, not capitalism and free market and those of us that warned, like you and Ron Paul, for 35 years.
[01:28:14.888 --> 01:28:24.675]  We should get medals, not be blamed for it, so we better explain all this right now so they get the blame and we don't get basically scapegoated.
[01:28:25.295 --> 01:28:34.981]  And also, look, the forces that be, the bankers, the insurance companies, the insurance companies want this, by the way.
[01:28:34.981 --> 01:28:38.444]  They funded Democrats very heavily on this.
[01:28:38.444 --> 01:28:40.625]  Obama wants this desperately.
[01:28:40.625 --> 01:28:41.846]  Let's not let them have it.
[01:28:43.887 --> 01:28:51.715]  If the New World Order forces want Obamacare so badly, that alone is a sign it ought to be destroyed.
[01:28:51.715 --> 01:29:05.808]  Because you know its intention is more control, more serfdom, more destruction of the private economy, less income and less control for people in their own hands, and forcing everything into a government health system.
[01:29:06.728 --> 01:29:13.434]  We've got to draw a line, and if it's at all possible to destroy Obamacare now, let's do that.
[01:29:13.434 --> 01:29:24.023]  And by the way, a shutdown on the government, I'd love to see people understand after three weeks, six weeks, two months, that we don't need this much government anyway.
[01:29:24.784 --> 01:29:25.885]  Why not shut it down?
[01:29:25.885 --> 01:29:28.607]  Why not shut massive portions of it down permanently?
[01:29:28.607 --> 01:29:29.168]  Exactly.
[01:29:29.168 --> 01:29:34.492]  We should send the House Republicans that are doing a good job thank you notes here.
[01:29:34.492 --> 01:29:38.095]  I mean, I can't wait to have the feds off my back.
[01:29:38.095 --> 01:29:39.236]  I wish they'd all go to hell.
[01:29:39.236 --> 01:29:40.357]  I'm sorry.
[01:29:40.357 --> 01:29:41.037]  Stay there, Dr. Corsi.
[01:29:41.037 --> 01:29:45.661]  We're going to come back and shift gears into your book that just came out today.

[01:32:10.928 --> 01:32:14.351]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[01:32:14.351 --> 01:32:17.814]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[01:32:17.814 --> 01:32:24.419]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[01:32:24.419 --> 01:32:27.862]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[01:32:28.502 --> 01:32:39.905]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[01:32:39.905 --> 01:32:44.867]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[01:32:45.387 --> 01:32:53.512]  To find out more information on how Supernatural Silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens, go to SupernaturalSilver.com.

[01:33:13.274 --> 01:33:18.696]  My friends, if you've read The Road to Thurston, written decades ago, if you've studied history,
[01:33:32.850 --> 01:33:46.438]  The reason I get angry and start almost hyperventilating on air is the IMF and World Bank are on record going in and giving loans to third world countries at loan sharking rates and in internal agreements.
[01:33:46.438 --> 01:33:59.887]  They only get it so the country has to agree that they won't pay it back and that a piece is given to the dictator or given to the corrupt Congress or the corrupt Parliament and a billion dollar loan in Nigeria becomes 40 plus billion in debt.
[01:34:00.885 --> 01:34:06.067]  You pay $40 billion over the years on a billion-dollar loan!
[01:34:06.067 --> 01:34:11.668]  And they gave terms to Greece and others that they knew would hammer the economy.
[01:34:11.668 --> 01:34:19.651]  Joseph Stiklitz left as the chief economist at the World Bank in 2002, and 2,000 pages of documents got leaked to Joseph Stiklitz.
[01:34:19.651 --> 01:34:27.413]  They declared national security on them, but not before he put out 100-plus pages on my show.
[01:34:28.578 --> 01:34:30.359]  The BBC Newsnight put it out.
[01:34:30.359 --> 01:34:33.921]  He was on my show the same day.
[01:34:33.921 --> 01:34:35.482]  The same day.
[01:34:35.482 --> 01:34:37.623]  He said, I can come on your show once it airs.
[01:34:37.623 --> 01:34:39.925]  It was airing over in England six hours ahead.
[01:34:39.925 --> 01:34:41.886]  A tape of it, you know, that he'd shot.
[01:34:41.886 --> 01:34:44.708]  The equivalent of Nightline.
[01:34:44.708 --> 01:34:46.449]  Greg Pallast.
[01:34:46.449 --> 01:34:53.093]  While he was on my show live, breaking it in 2002, where they planned to do this to America.
[01:34:53.093 --> 01:34:53.693]  That's the thing.
[01:34:53.693 --> 01:34:54.554]  These are criminals.
[01:34:55.703 --> 01:35:03.346]  They are the ones that lobby for welfare and socialism, so they always have a kept group that will riot.
[01:35:03.346 --> 01:35:04.486]  They call it the IMF riot.
[01:35:04.486 --> 01:35:07.027]  They have all these actuary battle plans.
[01:35:07.027 --> 01:35:09.388]  We always knew this, but it leaked.
[01:35:09.388 --> 01:35:13.849]  And Stiklitz, when he's come on the show probably five times, always says, I did not leak that, by the way.
[01:35:13.849 --> 01:35:14.990]  Do not say I leaked that.
[01:35:16.249 --> 01:35:20.333]  Okay, it just got leaked the same time you quit and went public about it.
[01:35:20.333 --> 01:35:25.538]  But I do admire Stiglitz, even though I don't agree with some of his politics, because he honorably quit.
[01:35:25.538 --> 01:35:28.181]  This is the most immoral thing you can do.
[01:35:28.181 --> 01:35:34.207]  Just like carbon taxes double on the third world would kill a billion people in a decade, Lord Monckton's numbers show.
[01:35:34.207 --> 01:35:35.728]  And his numbers are dead on.
[01:35:35.728 --> 01:35:36.790]  This is eugenics.
[01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:38.011]  This is command and control.
[01:35:39.139 --> 01:35:50.744]  All of our ancestors, one way or another, came here from Europe, if you come from Europe, or even other nations after that, in the second and third waves because you weren't allowed to be a doctor if your family wasn't doctors.
[01:35:50.744 --> 01:35:53.145]  You weren't allowed to own land if your family didn't own lands.
[01:35:53.145 --> 01:35:56.566]  You weren't allowed to even be a blacksmith if your family wasn't a blacksmith.
[01:35:56.566 --> 01:35:58.147]  You were kept where you were.
[01:35:59.306 --> 01:36:04.812]  And why do you think Mexico's gone from 10 million people to 30 million in the last 20 years?
[01:36:04.812 --> 01:36:12.539]  They turned all of southern and central Mexico, west and east, into UN biospheres.
[01:36:12.539 --> 01:36:15.582]  My dad in the 80s looked at buying land down there when I'd never heard of biosphere.
[01:36:15.582 --> 01:36:19.847]  Went down to Mexico and looked at rich Europeans, Americans, and Mexicans buying
[01:36:20.427 --> 01:36:24.468]  Mayans land that they've been on for thousands of years and you're only allowed to build certain things on it.
[01:36:24.468 --> 01:36:25.089]  There were U.N.
[01:36:25.089 --> 01:36:25.749]  signs, U.N.
[01:36:25.749 --> 01:36:28.390]  brochures, and my dad said, I don't want to buy land.
[01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:42.815]  I remember my mom and my dad, in Cancun, after we'd driven out, and I'm going back to Dr. Corsi, after we'd driven back from the middle of nowhere on the coast down there, and he said, I don't want to buy land they took from farmers and fishermen.
[01:36:45.638 --> 01:36:48.380]  Years later I go to Cozumel and other places.
[01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:49.561]  There's no fisherman fishing.
[01:36:49.561 --> 01:36:51.082]  They're not allowed to under it.
[01:36:51.082 --> 01:36:53.103]  Only big trawlers are allowed to come by.
[01:36:53.103 --> 01:36:54.144]  So they've all got to move.
[01:36:54.144 --> 01:36:55.885]  Can't grow corn anymore.
[01:36:55.885 --> 01:36:57.146]  Can't fish anymore.
[01:36:57.146 --> 01:37:01.028]  Big trawlers are only allowed to get the fish because they pay the Mexican government.
[01:37:01.028 --> 01:37:02.029]  It's all agenda 21.
[01:37:02.029 --> 01:37:02.949]  It's feudalism.
[01:37:02.949 --> 01:37:03.570]  It's serfdom.
[01:37:03.570 --> 01:37:06.512]  So they all got to go to Mexico City to be slaves.
[01:37:06.512 --> 01:37:09.254]  To then bring down America's wages and make us slaves.
[01:37:09.254 --> 01:37:13.857]  Just like China's used as a race to the bottom that Ross Perot warned us about and Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:25.686]  Amazing new book just finished it this weekend who really killed Kennedy already shooting up the New York Times bestseller list just coming out today 50 years later stunning new revelations about the JFK assassination.
[01:37:25.686 --> 01:37:30.993]  It's available at InfoWarsStore.com and the reason it's so important
[01:37:32.171 --> 01:37:42.082]  Is that it gets into who controls it and how it was a coup over America by the very same special interests that now want to coup over any form of wealth.
[01:37:42.082 --> 01:37:44.425]  They want you poor by design.
[01:37:44.425 --> 01:37:46.227]  It is such a crime.
[01:37:46.227 --> 01:37:46.987]  I love wealth.
[01:37:46.987 --> 01:37:51.712]  I love when I see somebody successful or with a beautiful wife or beautiful kids, I admire them.
[01:37:52.555 --> 01:37:55.598]  These people and the folks that serve them hate your wealth.
[01:37:55.598 --> 01:37:57.339]  They hate your success.
[01:37:57.339 --> 01:37:59.441]  And they're enemies of humanity, folks.
[01:37:59.441 --> 01:38:01.483]  And this is a philosophy throughout history.
[01:38:01.483 --> 01:38:05.506]  Are you for prosperity and admiring the virtuous?
[01:38:05.506 --> 01:38:07.188]  Or are you gang-related?
[01:38:07.188 --> 01:38:08.589]  Gang mentality.
[01:38:08.589 --> 01:38:09.950]  Thug mentality.
[01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:11.511]  Organized crime mentality.
[01:38:11.511 --> 01:38:12.652]  Dr. Corsi, I'm ranting.
[01:38:12.652 --> 01:38:15.354]  I want you to finish up on the whole banking takeover.
[01:38:16.135 --> 01:38:19.858]  ...that we just mentioned, and what I just talked about, this radical transformation.
[01:38:19.858 --> 01:38:22.140]  This is not rhetoric, this is really happening.
[01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:28.806]  America's going into the guillotine right now, and then segue, in the 25 minutes we've got left, into your new book.
[01:38:29.434 --> 01:38:32.556]  Well, it's basically the background of the book.
[01:38:32.556 --> 01:38:40.522]  I mean, I point out that the Kennedy assassination, which I've studied now for 50 years, I knew the Kennedys.
[01:38:40.522 --> 01:38:42.444]  I was back with my father.
[01:38:42.444 --> 01:38:46.927]  He was a labor lobbyist in the 50s in Washington.
[01:38:46.927 --> 01:38:52.271]  I go back to the McClellan Committee hearings, and it was a coup d'etat that killed Jack Kennedy.
[01:38:52.831 --> 01:39:04.081]  Engineered by the highest powers in America and covered up by those same powers, including CIA, including Lyndon Johnson, in conjunction with the mob.
[01:39:04.081 --> 01:39:18.593]  And going back to the McClellan Committee hearings, which was the start of Jack Kennedy's real rise to national prominence, that was the hearings against the mob going into the Teamsters Union.
[01:39:19.293 --> 01:39:39.416]  One of the key families that I write about that people don't really know much about, the Elkins crime family in the West, warned Kennedy that he was going to be killed and that the assassination would occur from a plot of a high-powered rifle with a scope in a tall building on a motorcade.
[01:39:40.297 --> 01:39:49.249]  Even the day Jack Kennedy awoke in Fort Worth on November 22, 1963, he was talking about how easy it would be to kill him that day.
[01:39:49.249 --> 01:39:53.295]  Kennedy knew an assassination attempt was in the works.
[01:39:53.295 --> 01:39:56.199]  And he also knew it was being organized from within the government.
[01:39:59.144 --> 01:40:00.485]  Continue.
[01:40:00.485 --> 01:40:08.491]  Well the, as I go, the attempt to kill Jack Kennedy, there were three attempts to kill Jack Kennedy in November 63.
[01:40:08.491 --> 01:40:09.872]  First two failed.
[01:40:09.872 --> 01:40:14.655]  One in Chicago and one in Tampa.
[01:40:14.655 --> 01:40:15.656]  Dallas succeeded.
[01:40:15.656 --> 01:40:21.960]  And it's important that it was a Secret Service agent in Chicago that stopped the first one.
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:22.341]  Correct.
[01:40:23.121 --> 01:40:24.923]  And he tipped off the Kennedys.
[01:40:24.923 --> 01:40:31.108]  The plot stopped because Kennedy didn't go to Chicago.
[01:40:31.108 --> 01:40:36.693]  In Tampa, Kennedy had to go to Tampa and the security was beefed up.
[01:40:36.693 --> 01:40:44.060]  But in Dallas, everybody trying to protect Kennedy thought it was raining that day, which it was in Fort Worth when the day started.
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:58.097]  By the time they flew the short 10-minute flight to Dallas, the rain stopped and the bubble top was taken off the car, which is the reason the squad in place to do the assassination, the shooters, went ahead.
[01:40:58.097 --> 01:40:59.259]  They didn't stand down.
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:04.022]  But, you know, what my book addresses is not... I name the shooters.
[01:41:04.022 --> 01:41:10.544]  I say who was there and how they got there, but the critical point is the forces who put them there.
[01:41:10.544 --> 01:41:29.412]  And I say Jack Kennedy started signing his death warrant the day he fired Allen Dulles from the head of the CIA in the Bay of Pigs because Allen Dulles was trying to trick Jack Kennedy into using a naval airstrike from a carrier offshore
[01:41:29.992 --> 01:41:37.214]  In this failed CIA invasion that was not a popular uprising, and Jack Kennedy wouldn't do it.
[01:41:37.214 --> 01:41:58.058]  Jack Kennedy said no to the CIA, he fired Allen Dulles, and of course I trace Allen Dulles and his brother John Foster Dulles, who was Secretary of State under Eisenhower, back to before the war when they were working at Harriman Brothers firm in Wall Street and they were financing Hitler.
[01:41:58.638 --> 01:42:01.641]  So people have to understand, we financed Hitler.
[01:42:01.641 --> 01:42:04.204]  We put Hitler into place in Wall Street.
[01:42:04.204 --> 01:42:12.413]  And also in that firm were the two patriarchs of the Bush family, Prescott Bush and George Herbert Walker.
[01:42:12.413 --> 01:42:14.555]  And they were involved in funding Hitler too.
[01:42:15.356 --> 01:42:15.697]  I think?
[01:42:31.693 --> 01:42:48.759]  And by the way, the word I've got is exactly the CIA and the people who've been in OSS and worked with the Nazis, they were the recipients of lots of the Nazi hoard that was the wealth of Europe, and that's the shadow wealth that's been funding the New World Order since then.
[01:42:48.759 --> 01:42:53.000]  In fact, in 1943, as I point this out in the book and go in detail, starting in 1943 when the Nazis
[01:42:55.453 --> 01:42:58.495]  In the know, knew that they were going to lose the war.
[01:42:58.495 --> 01:43:06.161]  Martin Borman, who was number two to Hitler, with Alan Dulles, took billions, maybe trillions, of the plundered wealth.
[01:43:06.161 --> 01:43:14.428]  You know, the gold for the Jews at the concentration camp, the bullion, the stolen art, the treasuries that had been looted.
[01:43:14.428 --> 01:43:20.292]  And Alan Dulles and Martin Borman invested that money into the U.S.
[01:43:20.292 --> 01:43:21.073]  stock market.
[01:43:21.733 --> 01:43:24.355]  Through agents in Switzerland.
[01:43:24.355 --> 01:43:29.298]  A lot of our post-war boom was funded by Nazi money.
[01:43:29.298 --> 01:43:32.520]  The other place they put it was in Argentina.
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:42.626]  The Nazis, it's critical people understand, the Nazis who escaped Germany escaped because we, Allen Dulles, the OSS, we allowed them to escape.
[01:43:42.626 --> 01:43:44.307]  We facilitated their escape.
[01:43:44.307 --> 01:43:45.047]  30,000 in one wave.
[01:43:47.054 --> 01:43:58.060]  And we brought over our Operation Paperclip, at least 20,000, I estimate, scientists, including, you know, people like Wernher von Braun, who did the V-2 program.
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:05.303]  He headed our intercontinental missile program, and he headed our space program for the man on the moon.
[01:44:05.303 --> 01:44:11.126]  He was building the V-2 terror rocket with Jewish slave labor in the concentration camp.
[01:44:11.126 --> 01:44:16.669]  A missile that was able to handle an atomic weapon if the Nazis ever developed one.
[01:44:16.749 --> 01:44:18.931]  Well look at Goddard, look at all of them.
[01:44:18.931 --> 01:44:30.479]  And also the whole agency, the whole Galen, not Gestapo, that formed a pillar of our CIA.
[01:44:30.479 --> 01:44:31.820]  Reinhard Galen?
[01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:32.841]  Yes.
[01:44:32.841 --> 01:44:39.826]  We took that whole organization and made it one of the cornerstones of the CIA when it was built on the Nazi foundation.
[01:44:39.826 --> 01:44:41.468]  See, what people don't understand, I think,
[01:44:42.449 --> 01:44:47.313]  Alex, the New World Order comes from National Socialism.
[01:44:47.313 --> 01:44:50.895]  National Socialism, the Nazis, were a leftist party.
[01:44:50.895 --> 01:45:02.024]  They believed in a partnership between government and business for lying wars, rearmament in order to promote the economy, multinational business.
[01:45:02.024 --> 01:45:03.285]  They opposed the communists.
[01:45:03.885 --> 01:45:07.166]  Because the Communists wanted to eliminate private property.
[01:45:07.166 --> 01:45:09.107]  Nazis wanted to enhance private property.
[01:45:09.107 --> 01:45:15.288]  They wanted to put it in the hands of an international elite.
[01:45:15.288 --> 01:45:19.850]  In fact, for those that don't know, Hitler had his own model of the UN he wanted to set up.
[01:45:20.650 --> 01:45:37.909]  uh... his own League of Nations and they were even planning on how to feed people food that was tainted and stuff so they would slowly die because they calculated people would resist a frontal assault so they even had a plan to depopulate the earth and the British eugenicist and other eugenicists
[01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:45.375]  Though they funded and helped shut up the Nazis, for those that don't know, double-crossed them, but then adopted their entire program.
[01:45:45.375 --> 01:45:49.118]  The 1968 Gun Control Act is the Nazi Gun Control Act from Nuremberg.
[01:45:49.118 --> 01:45:50.038]  That's on record.
[01:45:50.038 --> 01:45:56.683]  The first universal health care that we're fighting today with Obamacare was put in place by the Nazis.
[01:45:56.863 --> 01:46:03.926]  The Olympics, the modern Olympics, created by Adolf Hitler, he drew the ring symbol, the Volkswagen, he designed it.
[01:46:03.926 --> 01:46:17.572]  I mean, basically, when you realize that most of our world is basically Nazi, but it's not saying they're Nazis, it's that they took the Nazi model, mixed it with the British Empire model, and that's the New World Order.
[01:46:17.572 --> 01:46:24.855]  This is the New World Order, and it was a Nazi idea to have a New World Order, and the Dulles' and the Bush's embraced it.
[01:46:25.635 --> 01:46:43.607]  And they brought it back and they formed it as the cornerstone of our post-World War II, you know, Cold War, which people have got to understand, also, the Dulleses, the military, what Eisenhower warned, the military-industrial complex, these are all Nazi formulations.
[01:46:44.508 --> 01:46:47.750]  You know what Hitler's other pamphlet book's name was?
[01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:56.116]  It was New World Order, and they even had anti-Nazi cartoons of World War II showing Hitler going, I want my New World Order!
[01:46:56.116 --> 01:46:59.038]  Right, it was New World Order as a Nazi concept.
[01:47:01.010 --> 01:47:07.376]  Jack Kennedy would not fight these lying CIA wars.
[01:47:07.376 --> 01:47:08.857]  He wouldn't do it.
[01:47:08.857 --> 01:47:13.741]  Jack Kennedy also didn't put troops into Laos.
[01:47:13.741 --> 01:47:21.768]  Again, the CIA, with people like Lansdale, the CIA, wanted to develop this guerrilla, an army, a U.S.
[01:47:21.768 --> 01:47:25.471]  army that could fight in a guerrilla war, an asymmetric army like we have today.
[01:47:26.492 --> 01:47:39.284]  And they wanted no-bid contracts, because before, you know, beginning of Vietnam, you had, before that, we had one weapons system, multiple companies built it.
[01:47:39.284 --> 01:47:44.789]  But after Vietnam, Bell built all the helicopters, and they got no-bid contracts.
[01:47:44.789 --> 01:47:46.070]  Hey, let's go further.
[01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:47.151]  You take the current
[01:47:48.712 --> 01:47:51.055]  I mean, that's how many of these guys there are.
[01:47:51.055 --> 01:47:52.496]  He was trained by Klaus Barbie.
[01:47:52.496 --> 01:47:57.322]  And for those that don't know who Klaus Barbie was, he was top SS.
[01:48:10.316 --> 01:48:25.394]  And what I put on the book is the model for coup d'etat with a patsy and an assassination was developed in the 1950s by the CIA and they worked with Edward Bernays, who I knew, head of public relations.
[01:48:25.394 --> 01:48:27.997]  There was a banana company, the United Fruit Company.
[01:48:28.778 --> 01:48:33.241]  And the head of state from Guatemala was returning land to the people.
[01:48:33.241 --> 01:48:38.865]  So the CIA, Edward Bernays, Eisenhower decided they would have a coup d'etat.
[01:48:38.865 --> 01:48:47.330]  They created one of these false flag bogus armies that they invaded Colombia with CIA mercenaries, called it Freedom Fighters.
[01:48:47.330 --> 01:48:49.352]  They deposed the head of state.
[01:48:49.352 --> 01:48:50.893]  They got a new head of state they didn't like.
[01:48:50.893 --> 01:48:51.513]  They killed him.
[01:48:51.513 --> 01:48:52.534]  They assassinated him.
[01:48:53.154 --> 01:48:58.018]  It was the palace guard that supposedly shot this Armas, the head of the state.
[01:48:58.018 --> 01:49:03.122]  Nobody saw him do it, and they said, well, Armas took the rifle and killed himself.
[01:49:03.122 --> 01:49:22.398]  So you had the patsy dead, nobody to be blamed, a coup d'etat engineered by the CIA, and that model was the model that Dulles and the CIA used to put Lyndon Johnson in the White House with the complicity of the mob.
[01:49:22.438 --> 01:49:23.959]  Incredible book, all documented.
[01:49:23.959 --> 01:49:24.780]  I've read it, reading it.
[01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:28.242]  I already know everything in it, but the way you put it together is so historical.
[01:49:28.242 --> 01:49:31.905]  I'll guarantee you most people out there do not know 10% of what's in this book.
[01:49:31.905 --> 01:49:37.209]  And when I brag and say I know it's all accurate, it's that I've done deep research for this from like 50 books.
[01:49:37.209 --> 01:49:38.750]  This is all in one place.
[01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:40.631]  It confirms what you've been saying.
[01:49:40.631 --> 01:49:47.136]  This is the, you know, Alex, it confirms what I wrote in Who Really Killed Kennedy, that whole argument.
[01:49:48.141 --> 01:49:52.145]  is the basic origin of the New World Order.
[01:49:52.145 --> 01:49:58.911]  This is the book, finally one that isn't just about Kennedy being killed, but ties into why they did it, who they are, and let's go further.
[01:49:58.911 --> 01:50:10.501]  You know about the Vichy French, the two year infiltration by the Nazis, how the French really stood down the Maginot Line, that's how Hitler was able to take over France and only force out the Dunkirk Expeditionary Force.
[01:50:10.501 --> 01:50:10.922]  The British
[01:50:11.582 --> 01:50:13.203]  Because they'd already paid him off.
[01:50:13.203 --> 01:50:17.386]  That was the model of paying off the Iraqis to stand down both times.
[01:50:17.386 --> 01:50:19.988]  That's the model of infiltrating.
[01:50:19.988 --> 01:50:23.850]  They have Delta Force buying off all the local police chiefs in the U.S.
[01:50:23.850 --> 01:50:24.671]  right now.
[01:50:24.671 --> 01:50:27.793]  And what I show is, okay, Lyndon Johnson was happy.
[01:50:28.673 --> 01:50:32.895]  The Kennedys were going to expose Lyndon Johnson's corruption.
[01:50:32.895 --> 01:50:44.582]  And they had the article set to go in Life Magazine, and the Bobby Baker scandal, where Johnson, with one of his pages, was running a prostitution ring out of the Senate.
[01:50:44.582 --> 01:50:51.125]  They were working on vending machines with the mob in Chicago, putting them on army bases and other army contracts.
[01:50:51.125 --> 01:50:51.866]  Stay there, yeah.
[01:50:51.866 --> 01:50:54.387]  It's well-known LBJ ran a lot of whores.
[01:50:54.387 --> 01:50:55.728]  I've even stayed in a hotel with him.
[01:50:56.508 --> 01:50:58.609]  That's ridiculous, right downtown Austin.
[01:50:58.609 --> 01:51:01.051]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:01.051 --> 01:51:03.052]  You've thought about it for years.

[01:54:00.996 --> 01:54:01.617]  We're good.
[01:54:18.349 --> 01:54:21.132]  We bring the world new order!
[01:54:21.132 --> 01:54:26.117]  Euro-Hitler's World New Order!

[01:54:56.641 --> 01:55:08.827]  Alright, Dr. Jerome Corsi with us five minutes to the next segment and popping in later in the hour, Harold Rivera scheduled to talk about world events and I haven't even gotten to second command of country's nuclear arsenal is suspended in the United States.
[01:55:08.827 --> 01:55:11.248]  They claim for an investigation of gambling.
[01:55:11.248 --> 01:55:12.529]  Yeah, right.
[01:55:12.529 --> 01:55:22.654]  RN tells there's missing nukes at a Dyess Air Force Base and we have that from very high level sources and no one ever denied it or responded to it, even though we called them more than 10 times and sent emails.
[01:55:23.871 --> 01:55:34.393]  But finishing up with the Kennedy situation, this book explains the entire history of it, why it happened, and ties it into the coup d'etat over this country.
[01:55:34.393 --> 01:55:35.754]  Who really killed Kennedy?
[01:55:35.754 --> 01:55:43.075]  Available at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:55:43.075 --> 01:55:50.717]  And they are just harassing companies all over the U.S., shutting down factories, harassing doctors, even doctors that have small clinics.
[01:55:51.637 --> 01:55:54.320]  They're shutting down industry everywhere.
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:58.004]  That's exactly what the Nazis did, not just in Germany, but everywhere else.
[01:55:58.004 --> 01:56:00.807]  They shut down everybody but party members.
[01:56:00.807 --> 01:56:03.490]  So it's really a takeover of the economy.
[01:56:03.490 --> 01:56:06.173]  I think America's waking up to this, though, Dr. Corsi.
[01:56:06.173 --> 01:56:07.615]  We see the indicators of it everywhere.
[01:56:08.032 --> 01:56:08.933]  Well, I think so too.
[01:56:08.933 --> 01:56:12.036]  I mean, it ties in to what you've been saying, Alex.
[01:56:12.036 --> 01:56:24.829]  I mean, Lyndon Johnson was happy to use the false flag and the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which never happened, to fight the war and to allow the Vietnam War to be in the control of the CIA.
[01:56:26.451 --> 01:56:28.593]  Also, running drugs at the same time.
[01:56:28.593 --> 01:56:31.575]  The CIA has always worked with the mob in running drugs.
[01:56:31.575 --> 01:56:45.086]  In fact, one of the assassins I point out who was found in Dallas, November 22, 1963, was a well-known Corsican international assassin who went back to the attempts to kill de Gaulle.
[01:56:45.626 --> 01:56:51.870]  Who is helping with the mob and CIA with the drug trafficking in Vietnam.
[01:56:51.870 --> 01:56:59.356]  There's another reason the military and the CIA and you know big business wanted Vietnam to be fought.
[01:56:59.356 --> 01:57:00.897]  Huge amount of drugs were going to be fought.
[01:57:00.897 --> 01:57:01.937]  And by the way, DeCaul,
[01:57:03.246 --> 01:57:03.926]  I don't know.
[01:57:22.831 --> 01:57:41.699]  Instead, what we have is a world that the Nazis would have loved to have lived in, with Germany heading the EU, not a shot fired, a regional government controlled by Germany in the EU, transatlantic partnership, the NSA listening to every conversation in America, and a huge welfare state.
[01:57:41.699 --> 01:57:43.220]  It's a Nazi model.
[01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:44.500]  And then wars.
[01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:45.801]  No one should be surprised.
[01:57:45.801 --> 01:57:48.682]  Saddam Hussein, no weapons of mass destruction.
[01:57:48.682 --> 01:57:50.803]  Of course, it was a CIA lie from the beginning.
[01:57:51.343 --> 01:58:06.588]  And it's going on today, Assad using the chemical weapons, more CIA lies, John Kerry beating the wardrobe of the Secretary of State, when in fact the UN says it was the rebels, when in fact, you know, why are we going to support
[01:58:07.449 --> 01:58:13.075]  The Al-Qaeda and these jihadi mercenaries in Syria.
[01:58:13.075 --> 01:58:14.537]  There's no good guys.
[01:58:14.537 --> 01:58:19.663]  We've already supported them in Benghazi and in Libya to defeat Gaddafi.
[01:58:19.663 --> 01:58:25.470]  We're on the wrong side of the Muslim world fighting with Al-Qaeda.
[01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:26.871]  We've become Al-Qaeda.
[01:58:27.529 --> 01:58:29.070]  And it's all a CIA lie.
[01:58:29.070 --> 01:58:31.513]  These wars are fought not for U.S.
[01:58:31.513 --> 01:58:34.175]  interests, but to benefit the Saudi Arabians.
[01:58:34.175 --> 01:58:37.538]  And it's a war on the individual and the free market because we're a threat to them.
[01:58:37.538 --> 01:58:41.422]  Stay there.
[01:58:41.422 --> 01:58:44.905]  You are listening to Infowars.com.
[01:58:44.905 --> 01:58:47.628]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:47.628 --> 01:58:48.508]  We really killed Kennedy.

[01:58:50.723 --> 01:58:56.509]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:58:56.509 --> 01:59:03.896]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:59:03.896 --> 01:59:07.259]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:59:07.259 --> 01:59:09.021]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:59:09.281 --> 01:59:09.881]  We're good to go!

[01:59:56.169 --> 01:59:58.991]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.578 --> 02:00:10.401]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.401 --> 02:00:12.002]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.002 --> 02:00:13.543]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.543 --> 02:00:17.746]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.746 --> 02:00:21.808]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.289 --> 02:00:42.392]  All right, Arondo Rivera is going to pop in to give us his take on Obamacare, the government shutdown, arming the Al-Qaeda rebels, all of it, in the next segment.
[02:00:42.392 --> 02:00:51.635]  Then I'll get into all the news I haven't gotten into, the news that's up on DrudgeReport.com, the new NSA info about death squads operating not just overseas but here in America.
[02:00:52.395 --> 02:00:53.796]  That would make the Nazis proud.
[02:00:53.796 --> 02:00:56.599]  And Dr. Jerome Corsi's with us for five more minutes.
[02:00:56.599 --> 02:00:58.520]  Who really killed Kennedy 50 years later?
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:04.505]  Just probably the best book I've ever read on the Kennedy assassination, because it ties into everything else.
[02:01:04.505 --> 02:01:10.090]  And it's all the real info too, because I'm quite a buff on the subject, obviously, hosting this show over 18 years.
[02:01:10.090 --> 02:01:13.232]  And this is something I would give people that were doubters.
[02:01:13.232 --> 02:01:15.354]  This will wake people up.
[02:01:15.354 --> 02:01:20.138]  Going back to Dr. Corsi, sir, in the four minutes we've got left, we're obviously in a historic moment.
[02:01:21.650 --> 02:01:25.031]  It's obviously very creepy what the bureaucrats and regulators are doing.
[02:01:25.031 --> 02:01:28.412]  What do you recommend everybody do to really turn the tide?
[02:01:28.412 --> 02:01:34.933]  And I think we have a chance to beat these people if we take action, but what is the lay of the battlefield right now?
[02:01:34.933 --> 02:01:47.796]  Well, I think this, you know, we're coming up on a government shutdown, and a government shutdown, people should, you know, encourage the representatives in Congress, go ahead and shut the government down.
[02:01:48.596 --> 02:01:57.501]  The government wants you to feel it's going to be so painful, everything so awful is going to happen, they want us to beg to keep the government open, not to shut it down.
[02:01:57.501 --> 02:02:09.868]  Even at the pain of imposing Obamacare, there's another scare tactic to get the government over the final hurdle to where Obamacare cannot be defunded.
[02:02:09.868 --> 02:02:11.469]  This is a critical battle.
[02:02:11.469 --> 02:02:14.591]  People should be happy to see the battle going forward.
[02:02:16.112 --> 02:02:30.564]  You know, all the economic pain we're suffering from Obamacare, the part-time jobs, the wrecking of private insurance, the increased costs of medical care, these were intended by the people who wrote the legislation.
[02:02:30.564 --> 02:02:33.106]  That's the hard thing to get your mind around.
[02:02:33.106 --> 02:02:35.668]  It was intended to wreck private health care.
[02:02:35.668 --> 02:02:40.392]  It was intended to send people more into the arms of government dependency.
[02:02:40.392 --> 02:02:41.753]  And the only way we're going to break it
[02:02:42.193 --> 02:02:44.374]  Is to tell the government, no we won't do it.
[02:02:44.374 --> 02:02:46.516]  We're not going to accept more debt.
[02:02:46.516 --> 02:02:47.776]  Go back to John Kennedy.
[02:02:47.776 --> 02:02:51.238]  It's time to break up the CIA into a thousand pieces.
[02:02:51.238 --> 02:02:53.020]  We should never have fought in Vietnam.
[02:02:53.020 --> 02:02:55.241]  It was a false flag from the beginning.
[02:02:55.241 --> 02:02:59.023]  We've got to break up the Federal Reserve like Jack Kennedy would have done.
[02:02:59.023 --> 02:03:01.285]  Start printing our own money with the Treasury.
[02:03:01.285 --> 02:03:06.828]  And tell these banksters, we're not going to put more power into this new world order lie.
[02:03:09.175 --> 02:03:16.017]  You know, it seems like you've gotten more bold recently, Dr. Corsi, and I would say you're on fire.
[02:03:16.017 --> 02:03:24.259]  Is it because you sense that the quickening, the crossroads, the jump point, the event horizon is arriving?
[02:03:24.259 --> 02:03:36.663]  Yeah, if we've got a government in place that is willing to do a false flag in Syria on chemical weapons, lying about it, in order to put us more in the hands of Al-Qaeda,
[02:03:37.563 --> 02:03:41.047]  and jihadi mercenaries in Syria.
[02:03:41.047 --> 02:03:43.169]  If that's who our government wants us to fight with,
[02:03:44.515 --> 02:03:52.400]  If this final push is on with Obamacare, we're now at $17 trillion and about not to be able to buy any more of our debt.
[02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:57.062]  The only thing left is for these New World Order people to run naked to the finish line.
[02:03:57.062 --> 02:03:59.203]  And they're going to try to scare people into doing this.
[02:03:59.203 --> 02:04:03.786]  They're going to try to create such a crisis, everybody's going to feel they're going to lose everything.
[02:04:03.786 --> 02:04:08.489]  The only way you lose everything is if you give this government more power.
[02:04:08.489 --> 02:04:10.390]  If the government's going to crash, let it crash.
[02:04:11.917 --> 02:04:19.884]  You know, if the bureaucrats, all million of them that are employed by us, go home and don't ever come back, I don't think anybody's going to really miss them.
[02:04:19.884 --> 02:04:23.928]  I'll be happy if they start with the IRS and keep them home permanently.
[02:04:23.928 --> 02:04:27.971]  And then how about, you know, what they'll do is they'll say, oh, you can't have the TSA.
[02:04:27.971 --> 02:04:32.395]  Well, they want to have the TSA make the airports more difficult.
[02:04:32.395 --> 02:04:37.479]  The NSA is going to be working overtime listening to anybody who complains.
[02:04:37.479 --> 02:04:38.701]  Alex, we're at a critical point.
[02:04:39.381 --> 02:04:52.695]  And it's time now, when the Democrats are looking more and more like Republicans, let them all know that if they don't fight Obamacare, if they don't shut the government down, stop the spending, get rid of the Federal Reserve, that we're on to it.
[02:04:52.695 --> 02:04:56.840]  Because otherwise, we wake up in the camps and there is no alternative.
[02:04:56.840 --> 02:04:57.020]  Wow.
[02:04:57.020 --> 02:04:58.862]  Because that's where it's headed.
[02:04:58.862 --> 02:04:59.643]  Thank you, Dr. Korsi.

[02:08:06.768 --> 02:08:12.812]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:12.812 --> 02:08:15.354]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:20.606 --> 02:08:27.877]  I remember being 12, 13 years old watching Geraldo Rivera on his investigative reports on everything from
[02:08:29.562 --> 02:08:36.549]  The vault of Al Capone or whatever it was to drug kingpins being arrested.
[02:08:36.549 --> 02:08:42.594]  He is literally a TV journalistic legend and also got arrested once protesting Geraldo.
[02:08:42.594 --> 02:08:45.998]  I wasn't really protesting Geraldo, I was protesting mainstream media.
[02:08:45.998 --> 02:08:49.841]  But you can't really call him mainstream media, but he's somebody that works in the mainstream media.
[02:08:49.841 --> 02:08:51.323]  He is a real original.
[02:08:52.043 --> 02:08:54.084]  And he joins us for just this segment today.
[02:08:54.084 --> 02:08:57.686]  I wanted to get him on about Syria, but a lot of other things have happened.
[02:08:57.686 --> 02:09:02.808]  The government shutdown, Obamacare, everything that's happening, nuclear Iran.
[02:09:02.808 --> 02:09:05.629]  Are these talks real where they say they want to work with the West?
[02:09:05.629 --> 02:09:07.971]  John Kerry seems to think so.
[02:09:07.971 --> 02:09:10.032]  But Geraldo, again, thank you for joining us.
[02:09:10.032 --> 02:09:14.454]  People can follow you on your Twitter at Geraldo Rivera.
[02:09:14.454 --> 02:09:17.095]  But first off, what about the state of the country and the world?
[02:09:17.615 --> 02:09:25.439]  Is my instinct wrong that people are more awake and getting more upset now than they have in our lifetimes?
[02:09:25.439 --> 02:09:30.822]  Well, first of all, Alex, it's a pleasure being on, and you say I'm an original, so are you.
[02:09:30.822 --> 02:09:34.344]  It takes one to know one, so I'm pleased to be on your program today.
[02:09:34.344 --> 02:09:42.349]  Now, in terms of the state of the world, I think that in terms of domestic policy and Obamacare ever since
[02:09:44.130 --> 02:09:48.373]  2010, I think you really have a very motivated electorate.
[02:09:48.373 --> 02:09:58.660]  A lot of people are tuning in in a way they haven't paying attention and getting into the detail of government in a way they haven't been in a long time, and I applaud that.
[02:09:58.660 --> 02:10:03.904]  On the big stage, the stuff with Iran and the nukes and Syria and the poison gas,
[02:10:04.464 --> 02:10:30.382]  You know, once in a while people pay attention, but I think, generally speaking, you know, the appealing around most Americans, and I think this is what President Obama ran into, the roadblock he ran into when he wanted to bomb Syria, a lot of Americans just say, hey, you know, screw it, we've had, you know, over a decade of involvement in all these foreign adventures, we've bled, expended trillions of dollars, you know, lost too many lives, let them sort it out themselves.
[02:10:31.829 --> 02:10:44.583]  Shifting gears into just Obama in general, he promised so much and then has so under-delivered, even to his constituents, I think he's going to go down as one of the most hated presidents ever.
[02:10:44.583 --> 02:10:52.451]  And I'm sad because I really wanted race relations, you name it, to get better under Obama, and it seems like, well, the polls show it's gotten worse.
[02:10:52.451 --> 02:10:53.292]  What's your take on that?
[02:10:54.411 --> 02:11:12.942]  Well, you know, Alex, as a former hard-left, long-haired street lawyer, radical protester against the war and pro-civil rights in the 60s, I have to say that the election of the first black president in our history was like a dream come true.
[02:11:12.942 --> 02:11:19.966]  It was like the fulfillment of something I had worked for and never thought I'd see it in my lifetime.
[02:11:19.966 --> 02:11:20.787]  So when he got elected,
[02:11:21.547 --> 02:11:26.128]  You know, I can remember how emotional I was and how positive it was.
[02:11:26.128 --> 02:11:28.828]  But when you get down to it, you've got to govern.
[02:11:28.828 --> 02:11:37.350]  And I'm not, you know, part of it, I have no doubt, is the fact that the hard right in the Republican Party doesn't want him to succeed.
[02:11:37.350 --> 02:11:39.030]  I think that's part of it.
[02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:48.872]  But I think a lot of it is, you know, when I think back to the days of, you know, Lyndon Johnson or even Bill Clinton, we had, certainly Reagan, we had
[02:11:49.412 --> 02:11:57.474]  People that were, you know, they had their idealism, they had their ideology, they had their ideas, but they were pragmatic enough to make things work.
[02:11:57.474 --> 02:12:07.517]  And I think that President Obama has been a terrible manager, and he's been, you know, in terms of a divided government, he hasn't in any way reached out in a way he should.
[02:12:07.517 --> 02:12:07.897]  I think that
[02:12:08.277 --> 02:12:15.281]  A lot of what Daner, the Speaker of the House, and the Republicans are doing now is really appalling, but I think Daner is right.
[02:12:15.281 --> 02:12:22.706]  The Speaker is right when he says the President will negotiate with the Iranians, but he won't negotiate with the Republicans.
[02:12:22.706 --> 02:12:32.472]  I lament that fact, and I can't disagree that as of right now, if history was going to freeze right now, he would be regarded at best as a mediocre President.
[02:12:33.228 --> 02:12:58.648]  Now, Geraldo, I didn't get you on to talk about all the amazing things you've done, but it is interesting, and since I've got you here, before we get back into politics, out of the 170 awards for journalism, including prestigious Peabody Award, Emmys, national and local, and so many others, people forget you haven't just done the big sensational stories, you've broken so many big investigative journalistic reports and been threatened, been attacked.
[02:12:58.648 --> 02:13:00.610]  Out of everything you've done, what are you most proud of?
[02:13:02.022 --> 02:13:03.023]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:13:03.023 --> 02:13:04.143]  I don't even hesitate.
[02:13:04.143 --> 02:13:13.688]  There have been so many stories, thousands and thousands of stories, but the stories I did about the institutionalized, we used to call them mentally retarded, now they call them developmentally disabled.
[02:13:13.688 --> 02:13:15.409]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:13:15.409 --> 02:13:18.270]  Helping to close America's institutions for the retarded.
[02:13:20.311 --> 02:13:26.315]  Is definitely what I wish they would put on my tombstone instead of opening Al Capone's wall for sleeping with this one or that one.
[02:13:26.315 --> 02:13:33.619]  I want them to remember that we helped change the way the developmentally disabled are cared for in this country, Al.
[02:13:34.028 --> 02:13:38.991]  Yeah, that's why I brought that up, because I just kind of spurted out the Al Capone vault, and I bet you're sick of hearing about that.
[02:13:38.991 --> 02:13:41.673]  It's like I'm sick of hearing, I'm the guy with the bullhorn.
[02:13:41.673 --> 02:13:43.274]  It's like, oh, you're the guy with the bullhorn!
[02:13:43.274 --> 02:13:46.295]  And it's like, no, I've done a couple other things other than a bullhorn.
[02:13:46.295 --> 02:13:48.477]  You know, so much is going on in the world right now.
[02:13:48.477 --> 02:13:49.978]  My issue with Obamacare is...
[02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:53.481]  It was written by the insurance companies.
[02:13:53.481 --> 02:13:56.423]  Their stock has doubled in many cases.
[02:13:56.423 --> 02:13:59.645]  And it's going to be selectively basically enforced.
[02:13:59.645 --> 02:14:01.126]  A lot of people are exempt from it.
[02:14:01.126 --> 02:14:03.367]  I mean, I've got a big problem with Obamacare.
[02:14:03.367 --> 02:14:05.488]  Why do you think the American people have turned against it?
[02:14:06.616 --> 02:14:12.678]  Because it's so complicated, because you're right about the insurance companies leading the way.
[02:14:12.678 --> 02:14:22.382]  I know that, you know, I got half a dozen people work for me in various, you know, this thing on the boat in the backyard, my secretary, etc.
[02:14:22.382 --> 02:14:26.063]  And my health insurance for all those people has more than doubled in the last two years.
[02:14:26.998 --> 02:14:34.247]  And, you know, I can't think that it's not related to Obamacare, and it's been so badly explained.
[02:14:34.247 --> 02:14:41.557]  You know, I'm a socialist enough that I want everybody to have access to healthcare, poor or rich, you know.
[02:14:42.517 --> 02:14:45.979]  You know, that old line, the rich should live and the poor should die.
[02:14:45.979 --> 02:14:48.260]  You know, I'm not for that.
[02:14:48.260 --> 02:14:55.442]  But I think when you turn something over to one industry as opposed to another industry, they're going to do what's self-serving.
[02:14:55.442 --> 02:14:59.304]  You know, the bill seems, you know, incredibly complex.
[02:14:59.304 --> 02:15:01.145]  And why are they getting exemptions?
[02:15:01.145 --> 02:15:06.186]  And why is Congress not participating in the same kind of system as everybody else is?
[02:15:06.186 --> 02:15:10.028]  You know, I really think that it's a big, big, big bollocks.
[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:14.022]  But on the other hand, I don't like this government shutdown either.
[02:15:14.022 --> 02:15:15.903]  I think that it's not going to accomplish anything.
[02:15:15.903 --> 02:15:17.883]  They've made the point.
[02:15:17.883 --> 02:15:20.705]  To shut down the government costs a couple hundred million every day.
[02:15:20.705 --> 02:15:23.726]  It's just like burning the money in your backyard.
[02:15:23.726 --> 02:15:30.029]  I don't... I appreciate drama, but not when it costs taxpayers money.
[02:15:30.029 --> 02:15:39.914]  And it just seems that Congress is... If we talk about the President being mediocre, if Barack Obama's mediocre, the Congress is piss poor, if you get my drift.
[02:15:40.492 --> 02:15:56.017]  Haraldo, I want to get into Iran and geopolitically where you think, because you're a smart guy, you've been in the Middle East all over the place, you've been in Afghanistan, you've probably seen more combat as a journalism than even somebody like Oliver North, because every time there's a war going on, I turn it on and you're on television.
[02:15:56.017 --> 02:15:59.778]  I saw a report about three, four years ago where you were in Afghanistan with the Marines
[02:16:00.478 --> 02:16:05.123]  Where they admit that they're guarding the opium and helping basically produce it.
[02:16:05.123 --> 02:16:07.705]  The argument is, well, this way Al-Qaeda won't get it.
[02:16:07.705 --> 02:16:17.575]  What do you make of being somebody that, you know, covered the drug war from the time it began under Reagan to now that it's on record that our own troops are guarding the opium?
[02:16:18.962 --> 02:16:27.464]  Well, I think the big picture, you know, I've been covering the drug war since Nixon, you know, since 1970.
[02:16:27.464 --> 02:16:29.684]  We've spent well over a trillion dollars.
[02:16:29.684 --> 02:16:34.345]  The drug war is an absolute failure, an absolute abject failure.
[02:16:34.345 --> 02:16:41.507]  And to throw people in jail, you know, 20 years for that, there are women in jail in upstate Bedford, New York.
[02:16:41.507 --> 02:16:46.728]  They've been in jail for 20 years because they carried an ounce of coke for their boyfriend and got busted because they got set up.
[02:16:47.328 --> 02:16:49.010]  I think it's preposterous.
[02:16:49.010 --> 02:16:53.113]  I think that I'm very much of a libertarian when it comes to that.
[02:16:53.113 --> 02:16:55.115]  People have to sort that stuff out for themselves.
[02:16:55.115 --> 02:16:57.637]  I think it's just absolutely dreadful.
[02:16:57.637 --> 02:17:04.663]  The way we have, and what you were speaking about in the Marines, it's absolutely, literally true.
[02:17:04.663 --> 02:17:07.666]  Our encampments were in the poppy field.
[02:17:08.626 --> 02:17:22.338]  Uh, they would be, the harvesting of the crop happened right in front of us, and there I was with the brave Marines at that time in Helmand Province, again, shot at, and they are effectively guarding the poppy fields.
[02:17:22.338 --> 02:17:27.302]  I think it's really a disastrous awful, you know, in the bigger picture, you know.
[02:17:27.802 --> 02:17:30.005]  We're exhausted after Afghanistan.
[02:17:30.005 --> 02:17:34.110]  Afghanistan, you know, we paid back the people who got us, and I'm all for revenge.
[02:17:34.110 --> 02:17:35.972]  I think that that was a good idea.
[02:17:35.972 --> 02:17:40.257]  Hanging in there now 13 years, 14 years, I mean, my goodness, when does that end?
[02:17:40.257 --> 02:17:43.722]  Iraq was an absolute, utter zero.
[02:17:43.722 --> 02:17:44.643]  It was for nothing.
[02:17:45.363 --> 02:17:49.166]  You know, I debated with Eric Bolling on Fox all the time.
[02:17:49.166 --> 02:17:52.368]  Eric was accusing the Iranians of 9-11.
[02:17:52.368 --> 02:17:54.329]  The Iranians weren't in 9-11.
[02:17:54.329 --> 02:17:56.130]  The Iraqis weren't in 9-11.
[02:17:56.130 --> 02:18:02.995]  That was the Saudis, our dear friends, that were, you know, the 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis.
[02:18:02.995 --> 02:18:07.038]  I just think that you've got to really be careful before you commit U.S.
[02:18:07.038 --> 02:18:09.719]  blood and treasure to these foreign affairs.
[02:18:10.820 --> 02:18:12.262]  I'm sick of being in combat.
[02:18:12.262 --> 02:18:18.068]  You know, 12 times in Iraq, 12 times in Afghanistan, Somalia, every place in between.
[02:18:18.068 --> 02:18:26.978]  I'm all for, you get the people that get us, you try to preserve world order, you guard the ships and the horn of Africa, you keep commerce flowing.
[02:18:27.618 --> 02:18:31.461]  But to send a land army into any of these countries now.
[02:18:31.461 --> 02:18:37.367]  That's why I opposed President Obama when he wanted to bomb Syria because of the poison gas.
[02:18:37.367 --> 02:18:38.728]  It's just not our job.
[02:18:38.728 --> 02:18:39.929]  What about the UN?
[02:18:39.929 --> 02:18:42.131]  Does it stand for anything?
[02:18:42.131 --> 02:18:43.812]  Can it do anything?
[02:18:43.812 --> 02:18:46.775]  I think the answer is obvious.
[02:18:48.052 --> 02:18:50.174]  We've only got about four or five minutes left with you, Geraldo.
[02:18:50.174 --> 02:18:51.915]  I really appreciate you spending time joining us.
[02:18:51.915 --> 02:18:53.557]  You've got your syndicated radio show.
[02:18:53.557 --> 02:18:56.920]  You're doing the news show there on Fox.
[02:18:56.920 --> 02:18:59.702]  You've got so much, you know, other things that are going on.
[02:18:59.702 --> 02:19:08.851]  Let's talk about you and your life right now, what you're mainly focused on politically, but also personally, because folks obviously want to know a little bit about you and what you're doing currently.
[02:19:08.851 --> 02:19:11.733]  And then I want to finish up with geopolitically.
[02:19:11.733 --> 02:19:13.335]  How do you think this is going to end with Iran?
[02:19:14.249 --> 02:19:17.092]  All right, but in terms of me, you know, I do the Fox News stuff.
[02:19:17.092 --> 02:19:22.678]  I've kind of been an outlier, an oddball at Fox now going on 13 years.
[02:19:24.381 --> 02:19:29.864]  I went to Fox after the 9-11 attacks because I wanted to cover the war, and I think you're right.
[02:19:29.864 --> 02:19:35.708]  I think I've been in more combat situations than certainly any celebrity journalist.
[02:19:35.708 --> 02:19:37.229]  You know, it's been something I've been drawn to.
[02:19:37.229 --> 02:19:43.053]  I have a lot of pictures on my wall of me and GIs that have been killed since they took the picture with me.
[02:19:43.053 --> 02:19:45.474]  You know, Afghanistan, Iraq, it's awful.
[02:19:45.474 --> 02:19:49.597]  I've watched them, you know, their families go through all the stress, and now they're coming home.
[02:19:50.477 --> 02:19:59.205]  I'm very much aware of and covering stories about how they have all the problems, the baggage from the war, suicide and so forth.
[02:19:59.205 --> 02:20:01.287]  I think we have to totally be involved with that.
[02:20:01.287 --> 02:20:03.549]  I'm a father of five.
[02:20:03.549 --> 02:20:08.514]  I'm thinking about where I go from here in life.
[02:20:08.514 --> 02:20:09.575]  I've done so much.
[02:20:11.121 --> 02:20:11.701]  Stick it out.
[02:20:11.701 --> 02:20:14.122]  I've had a 43-year career.
[02:20:14.122 --> 02:20:16.643]  You know, everybody's got a Geraldo story.
[02:20:16.643 --> 02:20:17.623]  You have one.
[02:20:17.623 --> 02:20:18.764]  Everyone's got a story like that.
[02:20:18.764 --> 02:20:23.785]  In your case, it was being arrested on 48th Street and 6th Avenue.
[02:20:23.785 --> 02:20:31.528]  Perhaps more colorful than most, but there's been a lot of anecdotes, a lot of people whose lives I've touched one way or the other along the way.
[02:20:32.248 --> 02:20:36.350]  You know, sometimes I can be, you know, hardcore.
[02:20:36.350 --> 02:20:40.673]  I got scored the exclusive with the Iranian Foreign Minister Friday night.
[02:20:40.673 --> 02:20:48.277]  On the other hand, the month before that, I took that nude selfie of myself, so I'm still got my freaky side, and you know, I hope I always do.
[02:20:48.277 --> 02:20:50.558]  I want to be unpredictable.
[02:20:50.558 --> 02:20:56.482]  I'm a Republican, but I'm a pragmatist, and a lot of what the Democrats say, I prefer what the Republicans say sometimes.
[02:20:57.962 --> 02:21:10.147]  I think that the one thing, Alex, is after all this time having the advantage of that kind of one-name status, I get a lot of flack from a lot of other people.
[02:21:10.147 --> 02:21:15.509]  You, for instance, you get a lot more heat when you take a controversial position than I do these days.
[02:21:16.169 --> 02:21:42.880]  Well I do, and you're about to leave us and I want to finish up with Iran, and your phone's breaking up just a bit there, but Geraldo Rivera joins us, legendary journalist, celebrity journalist, you name it, but unlike many celebrity journalists, there's a lot of hard reporting over the years, even if you love him or hate him, you've got to admire the courage that he's had over the years, and he also got pretty mad, we're showing some video of that now, whenever I was bullhorning his live broadcast, he gave me the middle finger, that's pretty funny, you don't see Geraldo
[02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:47.661]  I didn't give you the clench fist, but I knew I really was.
[02:21:47.661 --> 02:21:48.462]  Oh, exactly.
[02:21:48.462 --> 02:21:51.763]  So what did you think when we showed up bullhorning you?
[02:21:51.763 --> 02:21:54.384]  Well, first of all, it took me a while to figure out what the issue was.
[02:21:54.384 --> 02:21:59.965]  And then, you know, 9-11 was an inside job, and I got that.
[02:21:59.965 --> 02:22:03.286]  And the anger, though, the level of anger was extraordinary.
[02:22:03.286 --> 02:22:08.128]  I mean, I was pissed off at you, you guys were pissed off at me, and then we were.
[02:22:08.128 --> 02:22:11.589]  If I had thought it through, in retrospect,
[02:22:12.069 --> 02:22:29.053]  What I should have done is just invite one idiot to come and tell me, you particularly, tell me what the beef was, you know, because once the substance of the issue became more known, I mean, it became a point where there's really some situations where you've got to talk about the facts and circumstances of the White House.
[02:22:29.433 --> 02:22:33.635]  Sure, you even later had me on your show to put out why I thought it was an inside job.
[02:22:33.635 --> 02:22:44.460]  When I say inside job, I mean they knew bare minimum, even Bo Dietl agrees with that, you had on the show that day, and they use it to take our liberties and to attack Iraq.
[02:22:44.460 --> 02:22:46.861]  And now look at Seymour Hersh coming out.
[02:22:48.482 --> 02:22:53.548]  Multi-time Pulitzer Prize winning journalist saying the Bin Laden raid basically was fake, didn't happen.
[02:22:53.548 --> 02:22:55.369]  I've talked to the Navy SEALs who were involved.
[02:22:55.369 --> 02:22:57.832]  They say it was a look-alike they really killed.
[02:22:57.832 --> 02:23:03.038]  Whether that's correct or not, no one buys what this system's saying anymore.
[02:23:03.038 --> 02:23:05.520]  And I saw the press report on it a few weeks ago.
[02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:08.603]  They said when Rolando Rivera and Alex Jones agreed that the Syrians
[02:23:09.264 --> 02:23:11.686]  Let me say one thing first on the other big picture.
[02:23:33.897 --> 02:23:50.263]  Isn't it interesting that Alex Jones is right about the NSA and the Patriot Act, and all those things that you were criticized for being paranoid and crazy about, and it turns out that the NSA is in our lunch.
[02:23:50.863 --> 02:23:51.204]  I think?
[02:24:06.341 --> 02:24:24.359]  I think that the best thing about it, I mean it is the best thing about something so horrible, is that you got the Russians engaged and you got the Iranians engaged in a way that neither of those two enemy quote-unquote powers have been engaged with the United States and with the West.
[02:24:24.930 --> 02:24:26.571]  And I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:26.571 --> 02:24:36.958]  And maybe, just maybe, we're joking, joking about the United Nations and how little it does, nothing it does.
[02:24:36.958 --> 02:24:45.244]  Maybe you have some kind of dialogue going on where you can actually see chemical weapons being collected and being destroyed.
[02:24:45.244 --> 02:24:47.746]  I think that that would be a good thing for the world, Alec.
[02:24:50.151 --> 02:24:51.031]  I agree with you.
[02:24:51.031 --> 02:24:55.513]  In closing, I hope that whenever you're breaking some big news, every once in a while we get you to pop in.
[02:24:55.513 --> 02:24:58.374]  And I enjoyed being on your show.
[02:24:58.374 --> 02:25:00.874]  I guess that was on Saturday a few weeks ago.
[02:25:00.874 --> 02:25:03.215]  And of course, my audience follows Fox News.
[02:25:03.215 --> 02:25:07.056]  Most of them are libertarian or conservative, but a lot of them are classical liberals.
[02:25:07.056 --> 02:25:10.197]  But again, plug your New York radio show, because that's also syndicated.
[02:25:10.197 --> 02:25:12.358]  I know people listen to it over the web.
[02:25:12.358 --> 02:25:14.258]  BBC Radio, thank you very much, Alex.
[02:25:14.258 --> 02:25:15.859]  And yeah, don't be a stranger.
[02:25:15.859 --> 02:25:18.740]  We'll swap appearances.
[02:25:18.740 --> 02:25:19.320]  I appreciate it.
[02:25:19.580 --> 02:25:23.763]  Let me just ask you this, at Geraldo Rivera is the place to follow you on Twitter.
[02:25:23.763 --> 02:25:25.363]  I'm at RealAlexJones.
[02:25:25.363 --> 02:25:30.887]  Do you think, do you think, just your gut, because I think the Iranians are starting to get a little bit scared.
[02:25:30.887 --> 02:25:32.868]  They've put a guy that's not as hardline in.
[02:25:32.868 --> 02:25:34.069]  I hope for peace.
[02:25:34.069 --> 02:25:36.030]  I hope that Israel can work it out with them.
[02:25:36.030 --> 02:25:37.551]  But Netanyahu thinks it's fake.
[02:25:37.551 --> 02:25:39.772]  What does your gut tell you about Iran?
[02:25:39.772 --> 02:25:41.073]  Will we end up attacking them?
[02:25:42.814 --> 02:25:57.520]  No, and let me tell you, 30 seconds, in 1980, in 1988, my talk show was taken to air in the Soviet Union.
[02:25:57.520 --> 02:26:01.762]  Monday through Friday, the Huraldo Show aired in the old Soviet Union.
[02:26:01.762 --> 02:26:06.064]  I swear to God, shows like mine helped bring down the Soviet Union.
[02:26:06.064 --> 02:26:06.284]  Why?
[02:26:06.284 --> 02:26:08.445]  Because the people in Russia looked at the
[02:26:09.265 --> 02:26:17.152]  Washing machine commercials, and the car commercials, and the color TV commercials, and they wanted that stuff.
[02:26:17.152 --> 02:26:19.774]  The people of Iran want that stuff.
[02:26:19.774 --> 02:26:24.358]  These economic sanctions have destroyed the economy in Iran.
[02:26:24.358 --> 02:26:27.880]  If you look at the Persian people in Southern California, they own half of L.A.
[02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:28.621]  already.
[02:26:28.621 --> 02:26:30.122]  They are enterprising.
[02:26:30.122 --> 02:26:33.545]  They're very Western-oriented.
[02:26:33.545 --> 02:26:35.707]  The mullahs and the ayatollahs,
[02:26:36.227 --> 02:26:41.452]  Uh, don't give them that kind of freedom and they're gonna, you know, then the Iranian people will take care of them.
[02:26:41.452 --> 02:26:42.793]  I want to encourage that.
[02:26:42.793 --> 02:26:48.318]  I want to encourage, you know, Iran opening up and, you know, that's the best way to keep Israel safe, I think, Al.
[02:26:48.840 --> 02:26:50.861]  By the way, that is one of your big accomplishments.
[02:26:50.861 --> 02:27:05.066]  I've actually seen it quoted in sociology text online at some of the prestigious universities that actually they do cite Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Levi's, and shows like Geraldo Rivera.
[02:27:05.066 --> 02:27:08.167]  I forgot, you were one of the first shows to beam into there.
[02:27:08.167 --> 02:27:09.928]  No, I was the first show.
[02:27:09.928 --> 02:27:14.910]  I was the first talk show from the United States on the air in the Soviet Union.
[02:27:16.365 --> 02:27:17.766]  Man, talk about changing the world.
[02:27:17.766 --> 02:27:19.507]  Geraldo Rivera, thank you so much.
[02:27:19.507 --> 02:27:20.647]  Thank you so much for the time.
[02:27:20.647 --> 02:27:21.948]  Alright Alex, good talking to you.
[02:27:21.948 --> 02:27:24.229]  Alright folks, there goes Geraldo.
[02:27:24.229 --> 02:27:26.510]  That was a great live interview.
[02:27:26.510 --> 02:27:30.933]  There with him, glad to go on his show, and glad to get him on our broadcast.
[02:27:30.933 --> 02:27:31.853]  What a character.
[02:27:31.853 --> 02:27:37.096]  You know, I tell you, people that you watched as a teenager, and then they're on your show.
[02:27:37.096 --> 02:27:39.197]  I mean, it's one thing to go on his show, but then he's on my show.
[02:27:39.197 --> 02:27:42.539]  I'm not even really starstruck, it's more just interesting.
[02:27:42.539 --> 02:27:43.980]  Because I could care less if he was some
[02:27:45.185 --> 02:27:49.187]  You know, sitcom guy from the 80s that I didn't watch.
[02:27:49.187 --> 02:27:55.349]  It's just a fact that you're growing up and you never think you're going to know Jesse Ventura.
[02:27:55.349 --> 02:27:58.451]  Or you're growing up, you never think you're going to know Charlie Sheen.
[02:27:58.451 --> 02:28:01.092]  Or you're going to know Geraldo Rivera.
[02:28:01.092 --> 02:28:03.473]  And we found the low-res video online.
[02:28:03.473 --> 02:28:05.273]  It's actually my film, Truth Rising.
[02:28:05.273 --> 02:28:08.535]  That is one of my best films because it's cinema verite.
[02:28:08.535 --> 02:28:10.055]  It's not voiceovers.
[02:28:10.055 --> 02:28:10.896]  It's not graphics.
[02:28:10.896 --> 02:28:12.276]  It's not articles.
[02:28:12.276 --> 02:28:13.117]  It's real people.
[02:28:14.261 --> 02:28:18.061]  I think Truth Rising is probably our least selling film ever.
[02:28:19.636 --> 02:28:21.596]  That's really unfortunate.
[02:28:21.596 --> 02:28:22.937]  I mean, it's free online, too.
[02:28:22.937 --> 02:28:25.057]  It's only been seen a couple million times.
[02:28:25.057 --> 02:28:26.277]  And people go, a couple million?
[02:28:26.277 --> 02:28:26.717]  That's a lot.
[02:28:26.717 --> 02:28:28.998]  That's nothing, folks, compared to the other films.
[02:28:28.998 --> 02:28:30.758]  And I think it's my best film.
[02:28:30.758 --> 02:28:32.738]  It's Cinema Verite.
[02:28:32.738 --> 02:28:34.379]  And it's about activism and waking up.
[02:28:34.379 --> 02:28:35.279]  You see it in high def.
[02:28:35.279 --> 02:28:36.319]  Geraldo getting really mad.
[02:28:36.319 --> 02:28:39.939]  He almost climbed down off the thing, because it was an hour-long show.
[02:28:39.939 --> 02:28:41.700]  And it was live.
[02:28:41.700 --> 02:28:45.720]  I just ruined the whole thing with 9-11's and Inside Job over it.
[02:28:49.980 --> 02:28:56.322]  You know, he's an activist who was a lawyer in all these famous standoffs and stuff, so I think that's why he kind of liked it afterwards.
[02:28:56.322 --> 02:29:00.904]  A few months after I was on, they go, hey, he wants you on.
[02:29:00.904 --> 02:29:04.045]  Now he knows who you are, he already knew who you were, and he kind of likes what you're doing.
[02:29:04.045 --> 02:29:07.246]  Because the truth is, I don't want to get Geraldo in trouble.
[02:29:07.246 --> 02:29:09.907]  Behind the scenes, he knows exactly what's going on.
[02:29:09.907 --> 02:29:11.787]  He's a smart cat.
[02:29:11.787 --> 02:29:14.588]  He didn't say, don't tell anybody it's off record.
[02:29:14.588 --> 02:29:15.429]  I've just talked to him.
[02:29:16.573 --> 02:29:23.656]  A few of his people, you know, short here and there, behind the scenes, during breaks on live TV or other things, and he knows a lot.
[02:29:23.656 --> 02:29:25.497]  He knows a lot.
[02:29:25.497 --> 02:29:28.618]  But he knows how to get it on Fox News that the Marines are growing opium.
[02:29:28.618 --> 02:29:30.479]  He's like, wonderful, you're growing opium!
[02:29:31.403 --> 02:29:33.024]  They just admit it all.
[02:29:33.024 --> 02:29:36.187]  And then he doesn't get in trouble, it just goes out on air.
[02:29:36.187 --> 02:29:37.968]  But we got Geraldo Rivera to talk about that.
[02:29:37.968 --> 02:29:45.674]  Folks, they load it on the C-130s, it comes into the airbases, and then when the cops catch your kids with it, they put them in the rape room.
[02:29:45.674 --> 02:29:46.815]  In the prison.
[02:29:46.815 --> 02:29:47.115]  Okay?
[02:29:47.115 --> 02:29:48.116]  The government is pure evil.
[02:29:48.116 --> 02:29:50.398]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:50.398 --> 02:29:51.799]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.799 --> 02:29:54.321]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.321 --> 02:29:57.003]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:05.733]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:30:05.733 --> 02:30:08.854]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:30:08.854 --> 02:30:14.398]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:30:14.398 --> 02:30:16.359]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:30:16.359 --> 02:30:17.980]  We are what we eat.
[02:30:17.980 --> 02:30:22.662]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:30:22.662 --> 02:30:26.885]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:30:26.885 --> 02:30:29.146]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:30:29.426 --> 02:30:35.649]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:33:28.346 --> 02:33:29.586]  Hitler took the guns.
[02:33:29.586 --> 02:33:30.887]  Stalin took the guns.
[02:33:30.887 --> 02:33:31.947]  Mao took the guns.
[02:33:31.947 --> 02:33:33.528]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[02:33:33.528 --> 02:33:37.389]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[02:33:37.389 --> 02:33:42.831]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[02:33:42.831 --> 02:33:45.832]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[02:33:50.263 --> 02:33:52.584]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:52.584 --> 02:33:56.126]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:12.363 --> 02:34:14.564]  We're in the homestretch here.
[02:34:14.564 --> 02:34:25.770]  We've got about 25, 26 minutes of worldwide transmission left on this Monday, 30th day of September, 2013 worldwide broadcast.
[02:34:25.770 --> 02:34:34.054]  America is becoming totally and completely enslaved because we've learned to bow to government.
[02:34:34.054 --> 02:34:35.535]  We've learned to grovel to government.
[02:34:35.535 --> 02:34:39.097]  We've learned to act like just because someone's in a uniform, they're God.
[02:34:40.549 --> 02:34:49.275]  I was talking to different factory people that get FDA inspections and did you know now the FDA inspectors actually wear naval uniforms?
[02:34:49.275 --> 02:34:53.898]  Naval khaki uniforms and call themselves by military rank.
[02:34:55.285 --> 02:35:02.847]  Every agency's arming against us, every agent's on a power trip, and they're all there to shut down small companies and leave big globalists alone.
[02:35:02.847 --> 02:35:10.510]  It is a savage criminal mafia shutting America down because the globalists own the factories in Mexico, India, and China.
[02:35:10.510 --> 02:35:13.911]  They've already got their slaves there, their suicide nets, their forced abortions.
[02:35:14.631 --> 02:35:22.423]  They're mobile execution vans and they want to force everything down to move it to what they own to transfer the wealth while impoverishing us.
[02:35:22.423 --> 02:35:27.971]  This is a total maximum effort criminal operation against America.
[02:35:30.848 --> 02:35:47.141]  I mean, I have seen stuff, some other news going on that I'm not at liberty to talk about at this point on a story we're working on that just, I mean, this, you read about the mining company out west, guys pulled that up, that had the EPA show up with armored vehicles and guys with machine guns.
[02:35:47.141 --> 02:35:51.284]  They are now going into regular factories for inspections with M4s.
[02:35:52.845 --> 02:36:00.511]  And standing there for hours, staring and messing with people, where it's just like a regular, you know, normal inspection.
[02:36:00.511 --> 02:36:06.515]  I mean, government is just savage, lunatic mental patients, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:06.515 --> 02:36:09.157]  Absolute savage mental patients.
[02:36:09.157 --> 02:36:10.659]  The tyranny has begun.
[02:36:10.659 --> 02:36:12.160]  I mean, they are just crazy.
[02:36:13.362 --> 02:36:14.882]  And most of them aren't even real soldiers.
[02:36:14.882 --> 02:36:20.264]  They're just like bureaucrats in uniforms who literally hate the American people.
[02:36:20.264 --> 02:36:24.705]  And they believe this is their time to take over, nationalize the economy.
[02:36:24.705 --> 02:36:29.066]  I mean, God help this country.
[02:36:29.066 --> 02:36:30.646]  There it is, Fox News.
[02:36:30.646 --> 02:36:34.827]  Armed EPA raids Alaska, sheds light on 70 Fed agencies with armed divisions.
[02:36:35.905 --> 02:36:40.812]  Yeah, I was talking, it's weird, like the last week, and then I talked to people that know other companies.
[02:36:40.812 --> 02:36:42.554]  It's manufacturing.
[02:36:42.554 --> 02:36:47.021]  I mean like, manufacturing bicycle chains.
[02:36:47.021 --> 02:36:49.484]  And you get SWAT teamed.
[02:36:49.484 --> 02:36:51.307]  Not that there's even a crime or a warrant.
[02:36:52.496 --> 02:36:58.979]  When they just come, they'll literally just stand there with a gun and go, and people's employees quit and freak out.
[02:36:58.979 --> 02:37:05.221]  I mean, this country is gone, folks, if we don't wake up and turn this around right now.
[02:37:05.221 --> 02:37:07.902]  Texas police hit organic farm with massive SWAT raid.
[02:37:07.902 --> 02:37:08.703]  Yeah.
[02:37:08.703 --> 02:37:10.483]  It's like when they do inspections in L.A.
[02:37:10.483 --> 02:37:11.964]  of, like, farmer's markets.
[02:37:11.964 --> 02:37:14.525]  They come with guns out and go, get out on the ground!
[02:37:14.525 --> 02:37:17.086]  There's people in there, like, buying squash, and they're like,
[02:37:17.406 --> 02:37:18.767]  Get on, get on, get on!
[02:37:18.767 --> 02:37:24.874]  I mean, it's all about, you're our food, you are scum, we're gonna get in your face!
[02:37:24.874 --> 02:37:28.838]  We're going to let you know we own you!
[02:37:28.838 --> 02:37:32.641]  They stake out the Amish for a year and a half, the guys are pulling up articles where I say this.
[02:37:33.527 --> 02:37:34.987]  So the guys have learned.
[02:37:34.987 --> 02:37:36.908]  I'm saying something, they can type it in, it comes up.
[02:37:36.908 --> 02:37:38.389]  I mean, I'm not making this stuff up.
[02:37:38.389 --> 02:37:42.270]  And it's thousands of cases now where I can't even cover it anymore.
[02:37:42.270 --> 02:37:43.170]  They have these stakeouts.
[02:37:43.170 --> 02:37:45.131]  They'll usually do it about six months to a year, a year and a half.
[02:37:45.131 --> 02:37:47.111]  It's usually about in a year.
[02:37:47.111 --> 02:37:49.572]  They'll move in next to Amish.
[02:37:49.572 --> 02:37:54.274]  They'll pose as like, you know, hippies or whatever and go, please sell me milk.
[02:37:54.274 --> 02:37:55.494]  And it came out in court in one case.
[02:37:55.494 --> 02:37:56.775]  They're like, it's all right, brother.
[02:37:56.775 --> 02:37:57.795]  I'll just give you some milk.
[02:37:59.110 --> 02:38:00.531]  And they said, I don't have a license or whatever.
[02:38:00.531 --> 02:38:03.654]  And finally, after a year, all right, have some milk.
[02:38:03.654 --> 02:38:03.974]  Come over.
[02:38:03.974 --> 02:38:05.435]  You want some cheese, too?
[02:38:05.435 --> 02:38:08.778]  And when the SWAT teams come, they shove the Amish down, stand around.
[02:38:08.778 --> 02:38:10.880]  It's all for the jury to see this.
[02:38:10.880 --> 02:38:13.782]  Like, look, we're dressed up in uniforms.
[02:38:13.782 --> 02:38:14.683]  And look at the Amish man.
[02:38:14.683 --> 02:38:17.245]  He's the bad man because we just shoved him down on the ground.
[02:38:18.081 --> 02:38:20.482]  Amish guys liking a straw hat.
[02:38:20.482 --> 02:38:21.783]  Get out on the ground, boy!
[02:38:21.783 --> 02:38:23.583]  It's all like the make-believe.
[02:38:23.583 --> 02:38:32.707]  If they dress up in black uniforms and put their foot on our neck, it means we're bad.
[02:38:32.707 --> 02:38:37.109]  It is total mental illness en masse by these people, and they're not stopping.
[02:38:37.109 --> 02:38:37.989]  They're accelerating.
[02:38:37.989 --> 02:38:43.672]  And the reports are now just pouring in from people I know.
[02:38:45.188 --> 02:39:14.260]  I mean, you'll have a fair, and they won't tell you that you're supposed to be part of the premises ID, not under law, but under the policy of the fair, and they'll find out who, under a government stunt they've pulled nationwide, people listening will know about this in your area, this is a stunt, a PSYOP, they will give the award for the woman with a sheep, you know, the teenager with a sheep, or a pig, or a cow, to someone that doesn't even really deserve it, by checking, oh, are you under premises animal ID?
[02:39:15.865 --> 02:39:18.948]  Even though there's no law, they'll say it's the policy of that.
[02:39:18.948 --> 02:39:30.417]  They'll let you win and then revoke it on the stage and have you cry in front of the whole fair to go, oh, I better get premises ID, animal ID that waives all your rights.
[02:39:30.417 --> 02:39:32.739]  I mean, it's all psych warfare.
[02:39:32.739 --> 02:39:36.402]  Everything is a total warfare against us.
[02:39:36.402 --> 02:39:39.004]  A total criminal warfare.
[02:39:39.004 --> 02:39:41.847]  A total criminal warfare.
[02:39:43.490 --> 02:39:45.670]  Totally evil, drug dealing.
[02:39:45.670 --> 02:39:47.551]  The government runs the child kidnapping rings.
[02:39:47.551 --> 02:39:48.331]  Look that up.
[02:39:48.331 --> 02:39:50.531]  Chicago Tribune.
[02:39:50.531 --> 02:39:54.012]  The government runs the cocaine, the heroin, the Prozac, the Ritalin.
[02:39:54.012 --> 02:39:55.112]  All of it on your kids.
[02:39:55.112 --> 02:39:59.713]  It is a group of pure, crystalline evil.
[02:39:59.713 --> 02:40:00.394]  On the top.
[02:40:00.394 --> 02:40:04.794]  Below it is a bunch of idiots on power trips.
[02:40:04.794 --> 02:40:07.495]  And all I want to say is, God help us.
[02:40:07.495 --> 02:40:10.176]  Because they're coming and they're about to bring the whole country down.
[02:40:10.176 --> 02:40:11.656]  And they're going to collectivize everything.
[02:40:12.421 --> 02:40:19.943]  And a lot of people know it's evil, but they'll still go along with it to work in the system to survive.
[02:40:19.943 --> 02:40:23.423]  I cannot describe to you the hellishness of these people.
[02:40:23.423 --> 02:40:24.984]  They're so criminal.
[02:40:24.984 --> 02:40:27.844]  See, because being criminal means you don't care about other people.
[02:40:27.844 --> 02:40:29.945]  You don't value not cheating somebody.
[02:40:29.945 --> 02:40:31.205]  So you'll even cheat yourself.
[02:40:31.205 --> 02:40:33.746]  That's why out of 420-something reactors, 91% of them are leaking now.
[02:40:35.876 --> 02:40:42.600]  Out in California and other areas when they leak now and the alarms go off, they turn the alarms off and then disable them.
[02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:45.161]  Yeah, the alarm was going off all the time for radiation leaks.
[02:40:45.161 --> 02:40:47.482]  You know what?
[02:40:47.482 --> 02:40:48.583]  We got a federal waiver.
[02:40:48.583 --> 02:40:56.307]  We're just gonna turn those alarms off.
[02:40:56.307 --> 02:40:58.388]  Didn't let the troops use DU until 1991.
[02:40:58.388 --> 02:41:01.190]  Now they're using them in local shooting ranges that the government uses.
[02:41:02.682 --> 02:41:04.724]  So what if it's a death sentence to those that use it?
[02:41:04.724 --> 02:41:09.608]  Kill them 20 years down the road.
[02:41:09.608 --> 02:41:13.010]  The criminals don't even care about themselves.
[02:41:13.010 --> 02:41:19.756]  So what if fuel ponds all over the country are malfunctioning and leaking and starting to catch on fire sometimes?
[02:41:19.756 --> 02:41:20.156]  So what?
[02:41:20.156 --> 02:41:20.937]  Let it catch on fire.
[02:41:20.937 --> 02:41:21.817]  Let it blow up.
[02:41:21.817 --> 02:41:22.698]  Let radiation.
[02:41:22.698 --> 02:41:23.138]  So what?
[02:41:23.138 --> 02:41:23.899]  We're just criminals.
[02:41:23.899 --> 02:41:24.399]  We don't care.
[02:41:24.399 --> 02:41:25.660]  We're tough.
[02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:28.002]  We like it.
[02:41:28.002 --> 02:41:30.744]  And really, they're just unorganized, undisciplined scum.
[02:41:31.633 --> 02:41:34.474]  Who could care less about anybody or the future?
[02:41:34.474 --> 02:41:38.835]  And who live horrible, degenerate lives, and their families are all messes.
[02:41:38.835 --> 02:41:41.536]  I mean, these globalists are just unbelievable.
[02:41:41.536 --> 02:41:46.458]  And we're even worse, because we sit here and we bow down to them.
[02:41:46.458 --> 02:41:51.499]  We sit here and we go along with everything they do.
[02:41:51.499 --> 02:41:54.720]  Instead of collectively realizing the government's an enemy now.
[02:41:54.720 --> 02:41:56.981]  And the people that run it are the occupiers of the country.
[02:41:58.510 --> 02:42:07.096]  Look at this article right here, Yale professor Fukushima will threaten humanity for thousands of years.
[02:42:07.096 --> 02:42:22.546]  And it goes on, a Yale professor is cautioning the world to wake up from its nuclear slumber and face the severity of the Fukushima radiation crisis, warning that all of the humanity will be threatened for thousands of years if Fukushima Unit 4 pool is not kept cool.
[02:42:23.444 --> 02:42:39.053]  The disturbing statements act as a voice of reality when it comes to the depth of the Fukushima disaster, an event that world governments have relentlessly attempted to downplay while silently shutting down radiation counters and raising acceptable levels of radiation in the food supply.
[02:42:39.053 --> 02:42:39.714]  That's what I mean.
[02:42:39.714 --> 02:42:41.555]  This is madness.
[02:42:41.555 --> 02:42:47.058]  These people are the infection of degeneracy.
[02:42:47.058 --> 02:42:48.459]  I'm going to get into the other news now.
[02:42:48.459 --> 02:42:49.420]  I briefly want to tell you that
[02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:51.801]  You can see this open bottle.
[02:42:51.801 --> 02:42:53.142]  I've been taking it twice a day.
[02:42:53.142 --> 02:42:55.784]  The nascent nuclear iodine.
[02:42:55.784 --> 02:42:56.704]  It's non-radioactive.
[02:42:56.704 --> 02:42:58.405]  It's called nuclear.
[02:42:58.405 --> 02:43:00.967]  Or, excuse me, atomic iodine is the proper name.
[02:43:00.967 --> 02:43:07.232]  Because the nuclei, because the atoms, it is pure, real, elemental,
[02:43:08.223 --> 02:43:08.703]  I don't
[02:43:26.465 --> 02:43:29.926]  It's on record as something that detoxes and binds to fluoride.
[02:43:29.926 --> 02:43:31.327]  It just does so many other things.
[02:43:31.327 --> 02:43:33.288]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:33.288 --> 02:43:35.349]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:35.349 --> 02:43:41.671]  Or you can call toll-free 888-253-3139 and see a short video breaking it down there on the site.
[02:43:41.671 --> 02:43:43.132]  An excellent news report.
[02:43:43.132 --> 02:43:44.692]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:43:44.692 --> 02:43:51.355]  And we're going to come out with a whole line of whatever the very best, best quality, best source is.
[02:43:51.355 --> 02:43:53.336]  Got a whole line of stuff I haven't announced yet that's being developed.
[02:43:54.127 --> 02:44:00.858]  Whatever THE best is, that I personally use, that my family uses, that we get great results with, is what we're going to be bringing you at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:44:00.858 --> 02:44:02.460]  And the great win-win-win about that is...
[02:44:03.860 --> 02:44:10.605]  We will then fund our own operations in the InfoWar and our free speech and getting the word out through the free market.
[02:44:10.605 --> 02:44:16.769]  So it's a beautiful thing when you shop with the good guys at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:44:16.769 --> 02:44:17.829]  It has links to it as well.
[02:44:17.829 --> 02:44:27.176]  We have the ModifyLine Seaweed that also uploads the truly elemental or atomic iodine.
[02:44:27.176 --> 02:44:28.617]  It has it as well.
[02:44:28.617 --> 02:44:32.599]  ModifyLine Seaweed's available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:39.842]  And then we've got the other sponsors that also make the broadcast possible, like SimpliSafe.
[02:44:39.842 --> 02:44:42.383]  There's some real scum in the alarm industry, you know that.
[02:44:42.383 --> 02:44:45.024]  You need to protect your home and do it right.

[02:45:19.628 --> 02:45:26.494]  Superbugs are winning the battle, everybody knows, against disease, but we can win the war with Supernatural Silver.
[02:45:26.494 --> 02:45:31.539]  Supernatural Silver is a safe and effective means of fighting pathogens where antibiotics and other drugs fail.
[02:45:31.539 --> 02:45:34.622]  Supernatural Silver can protect us from a wider range of attacks by...
[02:45:35.262 --> 02:45:38.604]  Defeating the root of these problems, bacteria, viruses, and mold.
[02:45:38.604 --> 02:45:42.286]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com for more information on how to protect you and your loved ones.
[02:45:42.286 --> 02:45:45.528]  They're simply the best silver product out there in my view of my research.
[02:45:45.528 --> 02:45:50.552]  SupernaturalSilver.com is the promo code AlexSays for 20% off.
[02:45:50.552 --> 02:45:53.553]  AlexSays at SupernaturalSilver.com.
[02:45:53.553 --> 02:46:00.838]  And it is the sponsors and the products that we sell that make the entire broadcast and transmission possible.
[02:46:00.838 --> 02:46:02.219]  So thank you all for your support.
[02:46:03.396 --> 02:46:06.920]  And thank you for spreading the word about the broadcast, and even more importantly, your prayers.
[02:46:06.920 --> 02:46:09.442]  We need your prayers now more than ever.
[02:46:09.442 --> 02:46:20.434]  We have approached the Zeitgeist over the years, and I've laid a hand on it many times and had Zeitgeist-level events worldwide via this operation, but now we are in the Zeitgeist every day.
[02:46:21.861 --> 02:46:38.146]  And whereas it's very effective at waking up the world and defending humanity, my prime mission, my prime goal, my life, my family, my wife, all of it, we all understand the main goal is not let these criminals fully destroy everything.
[02:46:38.146 --> 02:46:44.088]  Individually, we defend ourselves and want to stay safe, but we have no future if we don't take action.
[02:46:45.171 --> 02:46:52.245]  And being on the outside of this, folks, we need you to take action and be on the inside of it and be part of the big fight.
[02:46:52.245 --> 02:46:52.966]  We need your prayers.
[02:46:54.537 --> 02:46:58.779]  And we need you to take action and realize just how evil the system is.
[02:46:58.779 --> 02:47:00.560]  And there's a giant awakening happening.
[02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:09.243]  That's why Geraldo, off-air, but also on-air, as you just heard, pretty much apologized to me and said, I used to think you were extreme.
[02:47:09.243 --> 02:47:13.805]  But now, you know, it looks like it's worse than you said.
[02:47:13.805 --> 02:47:15.826]  And that's what I'm telling people.
[02:47:15.826 --> 02:47:20.228]  This stuff, I'm not up here saying all these scary things to be sensational.
[02:47:21.178 --> 02:47:29.284]  I'm saying these scary things because they're true and the scary thing is going to happen whether we admit it or not, might as well do something about it.
[02:47:29.284 --> 02:47:42.393]  And I think about how arrogant and aggressive and predatory the federal government is and these corporations and the stuff I've seen them do and how they treat people.
[02:47:42.393 --> 02:47:45.195]  These are people that get off on hurting innocent folks.
[02:47:46.431 --> 02:47:47.071]  We're good to go.
[02:48:09.417 --> 02:48:17.842]  Folks, Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, is on record to be a long-term volunteer subject of MKUltra.
[02:48:17.842 --> 02:48:31.009]  And evidence is clear it was then part of a super-secret government program of sheep-dipped, or people that basically changed their identity for a time, and that he then left some type of super-secret operation.
[02:48:31.009 --> 02:48:32.550]  By the way, this all came out.
[02:48:32.550 --> 02:48:33.590]  We just don't know the details.
[02:48:33.590 --> 02:48:36.552]  It came out in the LA Times and other papers during his trial.
[02:48:37.881 --> 02:48:44.486]  You can look that up, and how he had these super mathematical codes that were above stuff the Russians used.
[02:48:44.486 --> 02:48:48.889]  Kaczynski is smart, now in a supermax torture center.
[02:48:48.889 --> 02:48:50.530]  But do you think he really came up with all that?
[02:48:50.530 --> 02:48:52.031]  No, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:52.031 --> 02:48:56.895]  We don't know exactly what happened with Theodore Kaczynski, but we know.
[02:48:56.895 --> 02:49:00.818]  You look at his eyes when he drove out, when they got him at his cabin.
[02:49:02.762 --> 02:49:06.243]  And you look at the eyes, the way he looks knowingly at that camera.
[02:49:06.243 --> 02:49:13.765]  Kaczynski, as an academic, was let in on the big plan.
[02:49:13.765 --> 02:49:21.527]  And, you know, he said the robots and the computers are going to take over and wreck everything, and humans are going to merge with machines, and this is horrible, the end of humanity.
[02:49:21.527 --> 02:49:27.708]  I've got to bomb a bunch of people over a long period of time just to get the attention to put this manifesto out.
[02:49:27.708 --> 02:49:29.669]  And I'm not defending what he did, folks, but
[02:49:31.218 --> 02:49:43.932]  Imagine the focus for more than a decade to quietly live in a shack to do something like that, to just try to be able to get enough attention as his publicity stunt to finally put that manifesto out.
[02:49:45.748 --> 02:49:48.049]  And I'm gonna warn everybody that works for the system.
[02:49:48.049 --> 02:49:50.410]  You're not stupid, and you know why you've been put in place.
[02:49:50.410 --> 02:50:11.521]  They've done psychological tests on you, they've hired you because you either follow orders mindlessly, or you're really stupid, or you're a psychopath or sociopath, and even a psychopath ought to be smart enough to know the end game of this thing coming to fruition is not going to be good for anybody.
[02:50:14.190 --> 02:50:27.601]  It is going to be very destructive and the establishment itself is probably never going to make it out of this if they actually implement this.
[02:50:27.601 --> 02:50:29.983]  You don't come back from this.
[02:50:29.983 --> 02:50:38.991]  This system they've set up really is a great work of evil.
[02:50:38.991 --> 02:50:41.033]  It is a satanic art piece.
[02:50:42.253 --> 02:50:49.582]  And this planet burned out and destroyed will be Satan's greatest masterwork if we let Satan do that.
[02:50:49.582 --> 02:50:57.591]  And even if you don't believe in Satan, I will assure you the dark entity exists and wants to kill you and your entire line.
[02:51:01.334 --> 02:51:06.296]  Every time you eat a cooked food, your body responds by producing an increase in circulating white blood cells.
[02:51:06.296 --> 02:51:11.619]  This happens because nature designed us to eat food that is undamaged at the molecular level.
[02:51:11.619 --> 02:51:17.721]  When we heat food to normal cooking temperatures, we change the shape of the molecules into shapes the body cannot use.
[02:51:17.721 --> 02:51:20.903]  The body now looks at them as toxins and allergens.
[02:51:20.903 --> 02:51:28.506]  In an effort to protect itself from this irritant, the body intelligently increases the amount of circulating white blood cells to act as garbage collectors.
[02:51:28.926 --> 02:51:34.350]  White blood cells gobble up all the unusable damaged food particles to neutralize their cell damaging properties.
[02:51:34.350 --> 02:51:39.714]  This puts stress on your organs of elimination and your body is subject to cell damage and inflammation.
[02:51:39.714 --> 02:51:46.159]  If you'd like to start experiencing the benefits of undamaged protein in your diet, give One World Way a try.

[02:52:31.351 --> 02:52:32.992]  You are now in the crosshairs.
[02:52:32.992 --> 02:52:37.433]  The NSA and the FBI are treating you like a criminal and monitoring your every move.
[02:52:37.433 --> 02:52:44.655]  Ron Paul said recently, the evidence of the totalitarian nature of this government is on display undeniably every day.
[02:52:44.655 --> 02:52:48.937]  What's taking place right now is a coup and the destruction of the Constitution.
[02:52:48.937 --> 02:52:51.037]  Fortunately, there is something you can do about it.
[02:52:51.037 --> 02:52:55.619]  Learn how to be invisible, lock down your privacy, and even disappear forever.

[02:53:37.572 --> 02:53:38.933]  And is never freeze-dried.
[02:53:38.933 --> 02:53:42.256]  Pro-EM1 is the key to your digestive health.

[02:54:10.280 --> 02:54:13.602]  Hey, I want to hit a few final stories that are big that I haven't gotten to.
[02:54:13.602 --> 02:54:19.465]  I'll probably do a news alert tonight on the news or after the news at 7 o'clock tonight.
[02:54:19.465 --> 02:54:22.527]  To keep the show down to 30 minutes, down to be disciplined, but I may be doing a news alert.
[02:54:22.527 --> 02:54:33.413]  In fact, I think I'm going to do it after the news tonight, probably live, to get into all this other stuff I haven't covered yet.
[02:54:33.413 --> 02:54:37.495]  It just keeps hitting me, the desperateness of this and the immediacy
[02:54:38.491 --> 02:54:41.472]  Of we've been absolutely right and then some.
[02:54:41.472 --> 02:54:45.694]  We have the worst people in history running society and they're so dangerous.
[02:54:45.694 --> 02:54:46.914]  They're so evil.
[02:54:46.914 --> 02:54:48.515]  They want to hurt poor people.
[02:54:48.515 --> 02:54:49.815]  They want to abort babies.
[02:54:49.815 --> 02:54:52.096]  They're actively evil.
[02:54:52.096 --> 02:54:58.038]  And I just cannot impress on people how much danger we're in.
[02:54:58.038 --> 02:55:00.639]  And I see the awakening happening, but it's not big enough.
[02:55:00.639 --> 02:55:02.479]  It's not fast enough.
[02:55:02.479 --> 02:55:06.121]  I just wish people knew what I knew because I'm getting up here saying, you know, these are pure evil.
[02:55:06.121 --> 02:55:07.141]  They are pure evil.
[02:55:08.556 --> 02:55:12.999]  It's almost just so petty to even have half measures.
[02:55:12.999 --> 02:55:16.822]  I don't know what we do to stop them.
[02:55:16.822 --> 02:55:20.104]  I talked about in the first hour today, retransmissions coming up on the live show ends.
[02:55:20.104 --> 02:55:20.885]  It was very important.
[02:55:20.885 --> 02:55:25.008]  It took me an hour to break it down, but in there is the essence of how we're going to beat them.
[02:55:25.008 --> 02:55:33.934]  We really are occupied by people that carry out warfare as an economy, who are against humanity.
[02:55:33.934 --> 02:55:37.617]  Fundamentally, consciously, and write books and white papers saying it,
[02:55:39.003 --> 02:55:45.225]  And I don't want to just become acclimated and used to this, or I go along with it.
[02:55:45.225 --> 02:55:50.526]  Or I adapt to the tyranny, because that's what a globalist famously told me.
[02:55:50.526 --> 02:55:52.206]  The head of a major U.S.
[02:55:52.206 --> 02:55:59.688]  bank, who I happen to be on first class flight with, going to be on The View.
[02:55:59.688 --> 02:56:03.369]  And he told me some of the stuff off record.
[02:56:03.369 --> 02:56:05.569]  So what's off record stays off record.
[02:56:05.569 --> 02:56:08.070]  He said, Alex, humans will adapt to whatever we do.
[02:56:09.804 --> 02:56:14.265]  And he was talking like he was a space alien, because they are alien to us.
[02:56:14.265 --> 02:56:17.006]  And he said, people are going to go along with whatever we want to do.
[02:56:17.006 --> 02:56:19.047]  We're going to nationalize the economy.
[02:56:19.047 --> 02:56:21.868]  Through the crises, we're going to take it over.
[02:56:21.868 --> 02:56:24.429]  And the public is too dumb to even understand it.
[02:56:24.429 --> 02:56:28.450]  That's why we deserve to be in control.
[02:56:28.450 --> 02:56:30.870]  And be lucky.
[02:56:30.870 --> 02:56:32.311]  Lucky we're in charge.
[02:56:35.540 --> 02:56:49.325]  And the plane landed and he got up with his perfectly done hair and his perfect suit, got his perfect black French coat, and just looked at me and just laughed.
[02:56:49.325 --> 02:56:50.446]  He's part of the ruling class.
[02:56:50.446 --> 02:56:57.789]  He was visiting his dad, who's a retired general and really old, in San Antonio.
[02:56:57.789 --> 02:56:58.489]  Air Force General.
[02:57:03.988 --> 02:57:06.409]  And he's sitting there looking at me and he goes, yeah, I know who you are.
[02:57:06.409 --> 02:57:08.850]  He goes, you're not going to stop us.
[02:57:08.850 --> 02:57:11.492]  He goes, I'll tell you something off record.
[02:57:11.492 --> 02:57:14.253]  Cause you know, they know I'm ever say something that's off record on record.
[02:57:14.253 --> 02:57:17.434]  It'll not to give me info.
[02:57:17.434 --> 02:57:18.495]  I said, sure.
[02:57:18.495 --> 02:57:21.036]  He just sat there and just tried to demoralize me.
[02:57:21.036 --> 02:57:22.937]  I've got to stop nothing.
[02:57:22.937 --> 02:57:26.899]  It's like when I had Thomas Barnett, the big, uh, army psych warfare chief.
[02:57:29.744 --> 02:57:32.004]  He was teaching at the Army War College at the time.
[02:57:32.004 --> 02:57:37.866]  I saw him on C-SPAN say, we work for the New World Order, we work for foreign banks, we're taking over, nothing will stop us.
[02:57:37.866 --> 02:57:39.126]  So I called him to get him on as a guest.
[02:57:39.126 --> 02:57:41.387]  This was like 12 years ago or 11 years ago.
[02:57:41.387 --> 02:57:42.507]  He didn't know who I was.
[02:57:42.507 --> 02:57:46.708]  Then he figured it out and I called him that day because he said, no, I'm not coming on to the board operator.
[02:57:46.708 --> 02:57:48.948]  So I called him up during the break and I said, please sir, come on.
[02:57:48.948 --> 02:57:50.628]  He goes, no way I'm coming on your show.
[02:57:50.628 --> 02:57:52.389]  I know who you are now.
[02:57:52.389 --> 02:57:52.789]  And I went.
[02:57:54.414 --> 02:57:57.997]  Well listen, we're, you know, I know you want to push a new world government, but we're gonna beat you.
[02:57:57.997 --> 02:58:01.459]  And he goes, you're not gonna beat us, you're never gonna beat us.
[02:58:01.459 --> 02:58:02.620]  He goes, you're gonna fail.
[02:58:02.620 --> 02:58:05.422]  And he started laughing at me.
[02:58:05.422 --> 02:58:10.185]  I mean, it's just like, they're out in the open, nothing will stop us!
[02:58:10.185 --> 02:58:13.768]  I mean, it's just like, it's just like, whoa!
[02:58:13.768 --> 02:58:16.970]  And I remember him just going, hanging that phone up.
[02:58:18.106 --> 02:58:22.048]  I mean, these guys are just, I mean, villainous, man.
[02:58:22.048 --> 02:58:23.449]  Villains.
[02:58:23.449 --> 02:58:25.309]  Chillin' like a villain.
[02:58:25.309 --> 02:58:29.231]  And we all just see them in a uniform and just bow, so they're all gonna wear uniforms now.
[02:58:29.231 --> 02:58:30.912]  Every bureaucrat, every one of them.
[02:58:30.912 --> 02:58:32.533]  Hell is being released.
[02:58:32.533 --> 02:58:39.436]  It just came in on the truck, the October issue with Halloween masks to expose Obamacare at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:58:39.436 --> 02:58:41.097]  Get it, get involved in the InfoWar today.
[02:58:41.937 --> 02:58:46.121]  The new October 68 page magazine just came in.
[02:58:46.121 --> 02:58:47.223]  Be the first to order it.
[02:58:47.223 --> 02:58:49.425]  I'm going to keep going.
[02:58:49.425 --> 02:58:49.825]  Stay with me.
[02:58:49.825 --> 02:58:50.326]  We're coming back.
[02:58:51.567 --> 02:58:57.071]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[02:58:57.071 --> 02:59:00.894]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[02:59:00.894 --> 02:59:04.317]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[02:59:04.317 --> 02:59:07.779]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[02:59:07.779 --> 02:59:14.404]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[02:59:14.404 --> 02:59:17.827]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[02:59:18.467 --> 02:59:29.873]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[02:59:29.873 --> 02:59:34.816]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[02:59:35.356 --> 02:59:43.480]  To find out more information on how Supernatural Silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens, go to SupernaturalSilver.com.
[02:59:43.480 --> 02:59:46.201]  That's SupernaturalSilver.com.

[02:59:52.164 --> 02:59:58.967]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.819 --> 03:00:10.641]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.641 --> 03:00:12.222]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.222 --> 03:00:13.783]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.783 --> 03:00:17.964]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.964 --> 03:00:22.707]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.707 --> 03:00:29.990]  The control freaks organize themselves into communal gangs, or locust swarms, politically, economically, spiritually.
[03:00:32.745 --> 03:00:43.752]  At a sociological level, because it's easier as hordes to rob and enslave and steal than to build and construct, they think, because they're so stupid and degenerate and ugly, spiritually.
[03:00:43.752 --> 03:00:50.476]  They spiritually stink like rotten horse meat.
[03:00:50.476 --> 03:00:53.958]  You can smell them a mile away.
[03:00:53.958 --> 03:00:56.300]  And to them, this is their time to take over.
[03:00:56.300 --> 03:00:57.781]  This is their orgy of power.
[03:00:57.781 --> 03:01:00.642]  This is their gang taking over.
[03:01:00.642 --> 03:01:01.563]  Gonna be somebody.
[03:01:05.612 --> 03:01:08.133]  Quote the old Wasp song.
[03:01:08.133 --> 03:01:10.434]  I'm gonna be somebody!
[03:01:10.434 --> 03:01:11.874]  Be somebody today!
[03:01:11.874 --> 03:01:12.735]  Yeah!
[03:01:12.735 --> 03:01:14.515]  Then we should go out with that, find it on YouTube.
[03:01:14.515 --> 03:01:17.877]  Totally cheesy, but true.
[03:01:17.877 --> 03:01:25.300]  I was blind in Texas!
[03:01:25.300 --> 03:01:33.783]  But I sit here and I think about who these people are and what they're up to and what they're doing and there's no amount of good they can destroy that will ever satiate their appetite.
[03:01:34.557 --> 03:01:35.257]  It's cancer.
[03:01:35.257 --> 03:01:41.682]  It's just going to run through the body until we collapse.
[03:01:41.682 --> 03:01:46.625]  And so many of the corrupt will beg and scream while it's happening.
[03:01:46.625 --> 03:01:48.726]  By the way, it just came in.
[03:01:48.726 --> 03:01:49.487]  I'm really proud of it.
[03:01:51.522 --> 03:01:55.886]  I designed the cover and the back cover, working with the crew back there.
[03:01:55.886 --> 03:02:02.993]  It's double Halloween masks, and I don't really celebrate Samhain, the night of human sacrifice of children, Druid ritual.
[03:02:02.993 --> 03:02:05.635]  That's the night before all saints.
[03:02:05.635 --> 03:02:12.602]  But, you know, when you do go out, why not wear a big skull, missing the lower mandible.
[03:02:12.602 --> 03:02:14.163]  It's oversized, so it'll cover your whole head.
[03:02:15.160 --> 03:02:17.460]  And then you can tie just a rubber band to it.
[03:02:17.460 --> 03:02:19.001]  It's got the points to cut it out and put it in.
[03:02:19.001 --> 03:02:23.681]  You know, cut a rubber band, put knots in it, and then you just put it in right there, and then you can go around.
[03:02:23.681 --> 03:02:25.522]  This is thick paper.
[03:02:25.522 --> 03:02:27.062]  This will last for hours.
[03:02:27.062 --> 03:02:30.883]  Go out and you can be Obamacare for Halloween.
[03:02:30.883 --> 03:02:33.203]  And it says Obamacare, and it's a skull.
[03:02:33.203 --> 03:02:34.543]  I mean, I think that says it all.
[03:02:34.543 --> 03:02:36.004]  But then, hey, wait, there's more.
[03:02:36.004 --> 03:02:38.764]  You know, Prozac's not really prescribed a lot now.
[03:02:38.764 --> 03:02:40.644]  All of its hundreds of babies are.
[03:02:40.644 --> 03:02:42.325]  Same stuff, different name.
[03:02:42.325 --> 03:02:43.745]  Prozac the killer clown.
[03:02:47.458 --> 03:02:50.719]  And you can go around and tell kids about mass murder pills and how much fun they are.
[03:02:50.719 --> 03:02:53.660]  And has the school put you on these yet, huh?
[03:02:53.660 --> 03:02:55.481]  Seein' pretty colors?
[03:02:55.481 --> 03:02:59.222]  Havin' a lot of fun?
[03:02:59.222 --> 03:03:02.043]  Prozac the Killer Clown on the back.
[03:03:02.043 --> 03:03:03.264]  It's a double cover.
[03:03:03.264 --> 03:03:03.864]  And on the front...
[03:03:05.311 --> 03:03:10.816]  Obamacare and inside of the current issues some new articles but also some of the greatest hits the last few weeks.
[03:03:10.816 --> 03:03:13.378]  Navy Yard Shooter was on mass murder-suicide bills.
[03:03:13.378 --> 03:03:14.820]  Great to wake folks up about that.
[03:03:14.820 --> 03:03:18.203]  DOD training manual says the founding fathers are terrorists and George Washington...
[03:03:19.611 --> 03:03:20.312]  It's an enemy.
[03:03:20.312 --> 03:03:21.833]  No, we're not watching Red Dawn.
[03:03:21.833 --> 03:03:23.294]  It's the New America.
[03:03:23.294 --> 03:03:26.796]  Media protection of themselves.
[03:03:26.796 --> 03:03:27.577]  Media control.
[03:03:27.577 --> 03:03:29.398]  The death of the free press.
[03:03:29.398 --> 03:03:32.441]  They're going after the free press.
[03:03:32.441 --> 03:03:35.223]  And we've got Globalist openly embrace Al Qaeda.
[03:03:35.223 --> 03:03:37.024]  Just so many incredible articles.
[03:03:37.024 --> 03:03:41.488]  Sixty-six, or sixty-eight pages, excuse me, now.
[03:03:42.188 --> 03:03:47.393]  And look, we got people mailing in their cars with InfoWars on it from Russia and all over the world.
[03:03:47.393 --> 03:03:49.535]  Really interesting activist pages.
[03:03:49.535 --> 03:03:51.477]  Amazing artwork.
[03:03:51.477 --> 03:04:00.185]  It is all in the new issue of InfoWars magazine, so I hope... And again, you're awake.
[03:04:00.185 --> 03:04:02.668]  You know what's going on.
[03:04:02.668 --> 03:04:02.848]  But...
[03:04:04.827 --> 03:04:06.468]  Print's going out, so now it's in.
[03:04:06.468 --> 03:04:11.331]  You give somebody, hey, check this out, a big, nice color magazine with all this stuff in it.
[03:04:11.331 --> 03:04:12.312]  Well, they're ignored.
[03:04:12.312 --> 03:04:14.274]  Digital studies are showing now.
[03:04:14.274 --> 03:04:21.098]  Print, they pay more attention to, because it's almost becoming, you know, back in style, because it's so out of style.
[03:04:21.098 --> 03:04:22.979]  So, what's old becomes new again.
[03:04:22.979 --> 03:04:26.122]  This is our answer to the internet kill switch, so be sure and get it.
[03:04:26.122 --> 03:04:27.923]  And give it to people about, you know, having a baby.
[03:04:27.923 --> 03:04:29.664]  Hey, here's what vaccines do to your kid.
[03:04:29.664 --> 03:04:31.345]  The vaccines cause autism.
[03:04:31.345 --> 03:04:32.146]  Breaks it all down.
[03:04:34.730 --> 03:04:39.054]  Alright folks, I'll be back tonight on the Nightly News with a special report at the end of the Nightly News.
[03:04:39.054 --> 03:04:47.501]  But get these at infowarestore.com, or get a year's subscription, or give gift subscriptions, or buy them in bulk at cost, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:47.501 --> 03:04:52.185]  And pray for us, because believe me, we've got a lot of enemy attacks going on that I don't talk about on air.
[03:04:52.185 --> 03:04:53.786]  And thank you all for your support.
[03:04:53.786 --> 03:04:55.127]  We're all in this together.
[03:04:55.127 --> 03:04:57.349]  I wanna be somebody!
