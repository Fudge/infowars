[00:00.000 --> 00:13.200]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[00:30.000 --> 00:52.920]  Thursday September 14th 2017 I'm your host Alex Jones and I am locked and loaded today
[00:52.920 --> 00:57.560]  I've been preparing this broadcast three or four hours last night four or five
[00:57.560 --> 01:01.160]  hours this morning really doing deep research on all the topics we're going
[01:01.160 --> 01:06.360]  to be covering today we'll hit a lot of the political news but I'd already made
[01:06.360 --> 01:15.040]  the decision yesterday to announce on air that until about two or three years
[01:15.040 --> 01:21.600]  ago I spent about 60 70% of my time on hidden technologies hidden cultural
[01:21.600 --> 01:26.360]  developments things that the public wasn't aware of like human animal
[01:26.360 --> 01:32.160]  chimeras the plan to implant the entire microchip to buy and sell things like
[01:32.160 --> 01:36.080]  that that really affect everybody in this whole black lives matter George
[01:36.080 --> 01:42.680]  Soros Civil War climate I had been forced to get 80% political not 80%
[01:42.680 --> 01:51.240]  informational but I really just felt a calling in my own gut to still cover
[01:51.240 --> 01:56.560]  politics but to focus more into the social engineering everything from
[01:56.560 --> 02:03.640]  nanotech technology to forced inoculation to systems of world government to
[02:03.640 --> 02:10.680]  attacks on the family to really drill down into the nuts and bolts sometimes
[02:10.680 --> 02:21.560]  for an hour or more just on one subject and then Rob do came over last night we
[02:21.560 --> 02:26.240]  shot a couple videos at my house and he said you know Alex I I think we're
[02:26.240 --> 02:31.080]  covering politics too much you ought to get back the way he used to be covering
[02:31.080 --> 02:39.480]  more of the big breaking news of cultural change of technology but also of
[02:39.480 --> 02:44.240]  hidden systems of control what you're really were known for before the whole
[02:44.240 --> 02:50.200]  Trump era and I said you know it's funny you say that I said tomorrow I want to
[02:50.200 --> 02:54.960]  get in early and get with the crew because we warned people 20 years ago
[02:54.960 --> 03:00.640]  that they were pushing an agenda for implantable microchips and back then it
[03:00.640 --> 03:03.800]  was like oh that's crazy it'll never happen well we knew it was gonna happen
[03:03.800 --> 03:09.400]  because it was in DARPA documents it was in Alvin and Heidi Toffler's future
[03:09.400 --> 03:14.640]  shock books it was in reports written by Newt Gendrich when he was a college
[03:14.640 --> 03:19.040]  professor and a futurist and part of the Rockefeller Foundation that he wanted a
[03:19.040 --> 03:23.400]  planetary government everyone implanted with microchips to buy and sell he
[03:23.400 --> 03:26.720]  actually wrote that one of Alvin and Heidi Toffler's books in the forward but
[03:26.720 --> 03:32.360]  wrote white papers for the Rockefeller Foundation it's not a secret so suddenly
[03:32.360 --> 03:36.920]  this year we've seen all these reports saying you will take a chip in your
[03:36.920 --> 03:43.640]  child and you will have a driverless car and you will be run by technocrats and
[03:43.640 --> 03:50.520]  so it's it's like Fight Club or it's like an internet ether of the mind I walk
[03:50.520 --> 03:55.760]  in this morning and they said look drudge report linked to a story by Paul
[03:55.760 --> 04:04.700]  implanted microchip to replace credit cards car keys says the BBC says the
[04:04.700 --> 04:12.240]  Swedes so you have a government Stockholm syndrome where they say we want
[04:12.240 --> 04:16.400]  terrorists in the schools close quotes same thing with Finland and we want to
[04:16.400 --> 04:20.520]  let the Muslims rape us and we want to not be Swedish and we want to be
[04:20.520 --> 04:25.720]  overtaken and we want to be destroyed Stockholm syndrome loving your oppressors
[04:25.720 --> 04:30.160]  and they're now saying you're going to have a chip or you're not gonna get on
[04:30.160 --> 04:35.120]  the train and they say look we met with a swede and it's a black guy see
[04:35.120 --> 04:38.840]  everything's propaganda we met with a sweet I'm not saying the ant me black
[04:38.840 --> 04:45.240]  guys in a Swedish citizenship it's just always so stereotypical propaganda like
[04:45.240 --> 04:49.040]  all these BBC shows where it shows the ancient Britons were black and so just
[04:49.040 --> 04:53.560]  everything is propaganda woven with a propaganda going look you're getting your
[04:53.560 --> 05:03.560]  microchip it's so easy December 23rd 1776 these are the times that try men's
[05:03.560 --> 05:07.560]  souls the summer soldier and the Sunshine Patriot wheel in this crisis
[05:07.560 --> 05:10.760]  shrink from the service of their country but he that stands by it now
[05:10.760 --> 05:16.040]  deserves the love and thanks of man and woman tyranny like hell is not easily
[05:16.040 --> 05:19.880]  conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the heart of the conflict
[05:19.880 --> 05:24.200]  the more glorious the triumph what we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly
[05:24.200 --> 05:28.880]  it is dearness only that gives everything its value heaven knows how to put a
[05:28.880 --> 05:33.640]  proper price on its goods and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an
[05:33.640 --> 05:38.240]  article as freedom should not be highly rated Britain with an army to enforce
[05:38.240 --> 05:43.000]  her tyranny has declared that she has a right not only to tax but to bind us in
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.760]  all cases whatsoever and if being bound in that matter is not slavery then there
[05:47.760 --> 05:52.160]  is no such thing as slavery upon earth even the expression is impious for so
[05:52.160 --> 05:59.200]  unlimited a power can only belong to God Thomas Paine the American crisis as most
[05:59.200 --> 06:03.840]  of you already know I am a voracious consumer of news and information and in
[06:03.840 --> 06:07.960]  the last four or five years doing more and more research I came across the fact
[06:07.960 --> 06:12.320]  that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient
[06:12.320 --> 06:16.840]  ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today and our
[06:16.840 --> 06:21.800]  ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting
[06:21.800 --> 06:26.440]  killing and then processing and so I set out to develop caveman but to not just
[06:26.440 --> 06:31.400]  have concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood

[08:14.120 --> 08:18.760]  rallying patriots worldwide
[08:18.760 --> 08:41.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show there is a organized global system of
[08:41.480 --> 08:49.040]  corruption and evil that has made a conscious decision to implement the
[08:49.040 --> 08:55.320]  controlled disintegration and takedown of this civilization and of every form of
[08:55.320 --> 09:03.560]  freedom and of every form of normal biological human activity in what the
[09:03.560 --> 09:10.520]  social engineers and the captains of the eugenics operations call the final
[09:10.520 --> 09:18.960]  revolution the final revolution will automate and take full control of the
[09:18.960 --> 09:25.760]  genetic code and the complete operations of humanity and will be what the
[09:25.760 --> 09:38.480]  technocrats also call the end of history I've developed the term that they are
[09:38.480 --> 09:52.440]  writing the future history now they are writing the future now and we are here
[09:52.440 --> 10:01.040]  telling you the history of the future as is it is currently projected if I have
[10:01.040 --> 10:08.600]  a quiver of arrows on my back and I have a compound bow or I have a regular
[10:08.600 --> 10:17.120]  recurve bow or a standard Welsh long bow any type of bow and I draw that arrow
[10:17.120 --> 10:22.400]  and I'm proficient with that bow and I've practiced and I'm looking at a
[10:22.400 --> 10:31.440]  target a hundred yards away I can aim at that target pull back the bow to my
[10:31.440 --> 10:43.480]  ear relax and loose the arrow and from experience I know two seconds before I
[10:43.480 --> 10:47.360]  release that arrow that it's going to hit in the general vicinity of the middle
[10:47.360 --> 10:55.120]  of the bullseye of the hay bell I'm shooting it with an orange spot painted
[10:55.120 --> 11:08.840]  on I know the future before it happens you're like yes that's elementary that's
[11:08.840 --> 11:13.680]  easy to do that's like if you have a child that goes to school and you know
[11:13.680 --> 11:18.240]  the bus takes him home at three and they get home about 345 you know that you can
[11:18.240 --> 11:25.000]  wait there for that bus hundreds of times and little Bobby or little Jenny is
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.920]  going to get off that bus you are predicting the future accurately and
[11:30.920 --> 11:37.920]  civilization is all about being able to organize and then predict the future but
[11:37.920 --> 11:43.840]  to predict the future you've got to organize the future and the globalist
[11:43.840 --> 11:48.720]  have set up a system where they tell you there's no collusion in government
[11:48.720 --> 11:54.480]  there's no collusion with criminals and you shouldn't think about anybody trying
[11:54.480 --> 12:00.160]  to organize your future because there's no such thing so that you have a flotsam
[12:00.160 --> 12:05.880]  and jetsam attitude like a piece of garbage floating around the surface of
[12:05.880 --> 12:12.640]  the ocean where the tides and the winds make merriment with you and you have no
[12:12.640 --> 12:21.160]  rudder or no direction or no north star or no destination or no purpose this is
[12:21.160 --> 12:29.520]  how you first disorient somebody and put them into position to then lose their
[12:29.520 --> 12:43.480]  will and this is the currency that the globalist traffic in it's the highest
[12:43.480 --> 12:53.480]  thing they want is the control over your mind and then they trick people to think
[12:53.480 --> 12:58.280]  it's funny to laugh about this stuff because deep down some consciously it's
[12:58.280 --> 13:02.840]  a defense mechanism for the average person who is a complete loser and who's
[13:02.840 --> 13:07.400]  all alone and whose only friends or characters on television are kind of
[13:07.400 --> 13:13.400]  virtue signaling to other people on the street that they're part of the club but
[13:13.400 --> 13:17.200]  really they're completely empty and completely alone and Facebook's own
[13:17.200 --> 13:20.600]  documents there's thousands of different documents that show this from the
[13:20.600 --> 13:24.760]  establishment but just this year about how pathetic you are and how they want to
[13:24.760 --> 13:28.880]  make you more lonely and control you and then they're going to pop up ads for
[13:28.880 --> 13:33.080]  depression testing funded by the big pharma company should then direct you
[13:33.080 --> 13:39.000]  to a doctor to put you on a drug that reduces your life expectancy by 33% and
[13:39.000 --> 13:47.520]  causes massive brain damage by the way that's in the news today and that's
[13:47.520 --> 13:54.600]  only one facet of it yeah there's the New York Post in January telling us
[13:54.600 --> 14:01.600]  something we told you ten years ago what Google and Facebook want Facebook wants
[14:01.600 --> 14:09.480]  to be able to read your mind and control it and by the way the folks who want to
[14:09.480 --> 14:15.680]  control your will they're not jolly old elves they're not in Santa's workshop
[14:15.680 --> 14:23.880]  trying to make you some fun toys they're not very nice people they don't have a
[14:23.880 --> 14:38.880]  conscience all they've got pure absolute psychopathic will and my very fiber cries
[14:38.880 --> 14:42.760]  out against them let me just do this before I get into it in great detail
[14:42.760 --> 14:48.440]  let me just read the social engineering stack for you this is just in the stacks
[14:48.440 --> 14:57.880]  of news today there's a giant rollout from ABC news the CBS news the MSNBC to
[14:57.880 --> 15:05.600]  BBC to the Finnish and the Swedish governments perfect northern Europe
[15:05.600 --> 15:09.720]  cultures totally communal you can tell them to walk off a cliff they'll do it
[15:09.720 --> 15:15.720]  good people but there's just total social submission and it's why that Germany
[15:15.720 --> 15:20.880]  was so bad in World War two because they followed orders smart people but very
[15:20.880 --> 15:28.160]  tribal and they've announced they're gonna make you take microchips to get on
[15:28.160 --> 15:36.280]  the trainer bus now it's not coming it's here implanted microchips replace
[15:36.280 --> 15:42.520]  credit cards and car keys that's on news wars dot com info wars dot com and
[15:42.520 --> 15:46.200]  drive report dot com link to it it's a Paul Joseph Watson article we're gonna
[15:46.200 --> 15:52.360]  play a clip but it's just so wonderful oh 3000 have already lined up to get their
[15:52.360 --> 16:00.840]  chip here's another one transgender issues dividing schools parents and kids
[16:00.840 --> 16:05.880]  in the UK it says the Tavistock Institute this is just RT reporting it
[16:05.880 --> 16:12.080]  like it's a good thing runs it and it says they're now setting aside three
[16:12.080 --> 16:17.200]  year olds for their sexual surgery and their gender reassignment and the
[16:17.200 --> 16:21.800]  schools are gonna decide now and take little Billy or little Susie to have
[16:21.800 --> 16:27.720]  their genitals cut off it's not child abuse it's not pedophilia it's not it's
[16:27.720 --> 16:32.680]  not the most horrible nightmare novel ever oh no it's liberal because once they
[16:32.680 --> 16:39.480]  get you to say it's liberal and it's stunning and brave well then you've
[16:39.480 --> 16:44.680]  got to go along with it in the cult of Mithra as a caller pointed out that's
[16:44.680 --> 16:54.600]  what this is and it says right here as young as three years old directed by
[16:54.600 --> 17:00.880]  London's Tavistock Institute did you know that it's declassified that the
[17:00.880 --> 17:08.360]  Tavistock Institute is the premier organization for mind control they
[17:08.360 --> 17:11.840]  developed the plan for ugly modern art ugly modern buildings it's all
[17:11.840 --> 17:18.800]  declassified and directed the CIA's MK ultra program and it's well known the
[17:18.800 --> 17:26.000]  Tavistock Institute pioneered psychology with Skinner and others that
[17:26.000 --> 17:37.080]  pedophilia it was okay it was set up by OSS so the average person reads this all
[17:37.080 --> 17:42.080]  the Tavistock Institute is gonna help three-year-olds have their penises
[17:42.080 --> 17:52.960]  chopped off completely but that's okay because you know it's MI6 nothing
[17:52.960 --> 17:58.560]  creepy nothing evil oh then I just here's the news you know I'm just Duke
[17:58.560 --> 18:05.720]  recruits men for program to fight toxic masculinity oh that's right they've
[18:05.720 --> 18:09.880]  taken down images of men with muscles football team photos and colleges to see
[18:09.880 --> 18:14.880]  it's all heresy oh I'm just um this isn't tolerance see this is a man
[18:14.880 --> 18:20.600]  existing is hurtful and that's what women in the frontline combat's all
[18:20.600 --> 18:24.920]  about that's what all of this is about it's about ending all the roles to end
[18:24.920 --> 18:30.560]  humans so that when the machines come in we'll be so obsolete so drugged out so
[18:30.560 --> 18:36.600]  whacked out so atomized only glued to our smartphones we won't even know who we
[18:36.600 --> 18:42.280]  are smartphones in many studies are more addictive than opium Tucker Carlson
[18:42.280 --> 18:46.240]  asked the question last night have tucked have smartphones destroyed a
[18:46.240 --> 18:51.840]  generation you bet they have you give them to your children they get depressed
[18:51.840 --> 18:55.600]  they stop talking to you they get viciously angry if you don't give them

[19:03.040 --> 19:07.240]  it just turns out the women don't want that role and the money isn't coming in
[19:07.240 --> 19:11.680]  so see the social engineering is gonna be hard to force but they're gonna get
[19:11.680 --> 19:17.840]  it done implanted microchip replace credit cards and car keys you see

[25:07.960 --> 25:12.920]  today they're going from tolerance of people saying they're a dog or they
[25:12.920 --> 25:16.920]  identify as a blind person so they don't bleach in their eyes and then you pay
[25:16.920 --> 25:20.840]  for their welfare for the rest of their life they're moving past being
[25:20.840 --> 25:28.200]  tolerant of mental illness to now force feeding it to the children we're gonna
[25:28.200 --> 25:34.760]  break it all down coming up but first I wanted to get into some of the other
[25:34.760 --> 25:38.040]  news that we're gonna get to in a longer segment that's coming up here in just a
[25:38.040 --> 25:45.360]  moment and that was the hysteria that broke out last night at about six o'clock
[25:45.360 --> 25:55.360]  that Trump was going to reauthorize the Dream Act with an executive order and
[25:55.960 --> 26:00.680]  that it was gonna be done by the end of the night and then I went and read the
[26:00.680 --> 26:06.640]  articles from Breitbart not criticizing them but it's true CNN you name it and
[26:06.640 --> 26:12.920]  they all said it's a done deal Chuckie Schumer and Nancy Pelosi say so well I
[26:12.920 --> 26:16.520]  mean those two can barely walk or talk I don't believe they may say and then
[26:16.520 --> 26:20.720]  sure enough by about 10 o'clock at night Trump's like we're in negotiations
[26:20.720 --> 26:24.520]  and we've said no such thing and I've already said it's gonna have to be a
[26:24.520 --> 26:31.440]  law I don't have the executive power to just sit there and legalize a bunch of
[26:31.440 --> 26:38.120]  people who we can't track it has to be a law we have to have a vote he never said
[26:38.120 --> 26:46.840]  it he never did it and it's not about defending Trump it's about just reality
[26:46.840 --> 26:50.640]  I mean I could have run with the fake news that he was gonna betray us and
[26:50.640 --> 26:55.640]  stab us in the back last night and it was all over and have a big internet
[26:55.640 --> 27:00.480]  scare and then in the morning say oh sorry Nancy Pelosi lied but what is the
[27:00.480 --> 27:09.720]  point jumping on that bandwagon we're gonna be covering that coming up the
[27:09.720 --> 27:16.280]  next segment in detail also Bernie Sanders Medicaid for all plan would
[27:16.280 --> 27:20.880]  absolutely kill our entire health care system but that's what it was always
[27:20.880 --> 27:27.320]  meant to do remember Ezekiel Emanuel said we're going to use Obamacare to wreck
[27:27.320 --> 27:31.280]  the system then we're gonna have single payer but run by big corporations yes
[27:31.280 --> 27:36.120]  big corporations forcing you to buy their overpriced product with government
[27:36.120 --> 27:42.240]  enforcement powers talk about a dream of a fascist talk about guaranteed to
[27:42.240 --> 27:48.560]  spiral cost and it's done it and now phase two is here and as all the
[27:48.560 --> 27:54.800]  Democrats lined up behind it because it was always the plan wreck it loot it and
[27:54.800 --> 27:59.560]  then bring in something even worse that's the cycle of abuse of the public
[27:59.560 --> 28:04.960]  because as Jonathan Gruber said thank God you're so stupid thank God you trust
[28:04.960 --> 28:14.040]  Obama thank God you don't have attention spans so that's all coming up as well

[29:53.560 --> 29:55.960]  network
[29:58.400 --> 30:02.400]  what exactly is political correctness and why is it being pushed on the American
[30:02.400 --> 30:06.040]  public well political correctness is simply a form of psychological
[30:06.040 --> 30:09.680]  manipulation the government uses to control public opinion by controlling
[30:09.680 --> 30:13.240]  your opinions the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda but
[30:13.240 --> 30:17.240]  to also ensure that your government created viewpoint also influences others
[30:17.240 --> 30:20.800]  in ripple effect this is how the power elite and government stay in power the
[30:20.800 --> 30:24.520]  use psychological manipulation they turn the public into obedient sheeple and
[30:24.520 --> 30:28.360]  over time we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception but
[30:28.360 --> 30:32.080]  how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work well first
[30:32.080 --> 30:35.520]  the establishment saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying to
[30:35.520 --> 30:39.680]  push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted as
[30:39.680 --> 30:43.520]  truth such as global warming for example then the establishment suppresses any
[30:43.520 --> 30:47.640]  counter arguments to their agenda by calling critics cookie nut jobs racist

[33:08.440 --> 33:15.000]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're
[33:15.000 --> 33:32.720]  listening to Alex Jones I've got a stack of mainstream scientific reports for
[33:32.720 --> 33:38.560]  major universities and scientific institutions admitting the screen time
[33:38.560 --> 33:44.840]  but namely smartphones which are just highly compact advanced computers with
[33:44.840 --> 33:52.160]  psychological warfare algorithm systems integrated in for total control the
[33:52.160 --> 33:57.960]  facts are in that they are causing massive brain damage massive cultural
[33:57.960 --> 34:05.640]  collapse massive loneliness massive mental problems and of course it's all
[34:05.640 --> 34:10.760]  integrated into a larger program where they studied similar systems for decades
[34:10.760 --> 34:17.480]  on primates and on humans to then offer you drugs and counseling and induction
[34:17.480 --> 34:28.160]  into a psychological lynching and it's all in the official white papers it's all
[34:28.160 --> 34:31.520]  admitted they want to make you totally alone totally desperate totally depressed
[34:31.520 --> 34:35.880]  until they finally kill you with psychotropic drugs or you kill yourself
[34:35.880 --> 34:43.040]  and they want you very very nihilistic and hateful to spew that energy out to
[34:43.040 --> 34:48.880]  basically turn the whole world into Seattle into just desperate loneliness
[34:48.880 --> 34:56.880]  sadness but clinging to your your cloak of trendiness like lead shoes as you're
[34:56.880 --> 35:04.360]  thrown overboard but but clinging to the big thousand-pound steel bowling ball
[35:04.360 --> 35:12.760]  clinging to your enslavement kissing it as you plunge down into the depths
[35:17.800 --> 35:22.200]  you have to understand the people involved in all this they're just higher
[35:22.200 --> 35:28.040]  IQ people that fell to evil fell to the same wavelength and then they just want
[35:28.040 --> 35:32.280]  to hurt you as bad and they love brain damage in your children with the
[35:32.280 --> 35:36.960]  vaccines they love the GMO they love the fluoride they love the nutrient
[35:36.960 --> 35:41.560]  deficiencies they love going to a public event and looking at how sickly
[35:41.560 --> 35:46.320]  almost everyone looks and how you can't tell is that a male is that a female not
[35:46.320 --> 35:49.320]  because they've had gender reassignment but because they've been hit with so many
[35:49.320 --> 35:53.600]  hormones and chemicals that they're already walking dead people like Chuck
[35:53.600 --> 36:03.240]  Schumer Nancy Pelosi these globalists I mean they they their power is seeing you
[36:03.240 --> 36:09.800]  destroyed and alone and weak repeating political slogans like parrots that they
[36:09.800 --> 36:18.240]  put into you jibbering I found a video of my daughter showed me on Instagram this
[36:18.240 --> 36:23.120]  morning of the little goblin guy that attacked me with the hot coffee of a
[36:23.120 --> 36:28.880]  month ago in Seattle where they slowed it down and illustrated it we're gonna
[36:28.880 --> 36:35.680]  play coming up the next segment that is so powerful and I'm gonna copy this this
[36:35.680 --> 36:41.920]  based meme Lord video over and put it on YouTube and Facebook ourselves because
[36:41.920 --> 36:48.920]  it's totally illustrative about serious the situation is because I don't take
[36:48.920 --> 36:53.320]  pleasure in the fact that these people have been rendered down to almost a
[36:53.320 --> 37:01.680]  subhuman condition this has been done by top psych warfare experts Julian
[37:01.680 --> 37:12.040]  Huxley in 1932 published Aldous Huxley in 1932 published Brave New World Julian
[37:12.040 --> 37:17.600]  Huxley was his brother the head of the worldwide eugenics society who then
[37:17.600 --> 37:22.120]  founded the United Nations with the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute Rockefeller
[37:22.120 --> 37:27.680]  Foundation after World War two and they did it to put the Nazi program
[37:27.680 --> 37:33.560]  underground but make it liberal as long as you say it's for the minorities who
[37:33.560 --> 37:36.520]  are the majority and then make it all quote liberal but then make all them
[37:36.520 --> 37:40.360]  race-based as well you can then play groups off against each other in a race
[37:40.360 --> 37:46.040]  based system and Huxley wrote three books that I've read that you could read
[37:46.040 --> 37:52.760]  Brave New World revisited and others in the early 1960s that were nonfiction and
[37:52.760 --> 37:58.820]  he said this is a real plan and by successive chemicals in the water and
[37:58.820 --> 38:02.800]  vaccines we're gonna blur the sexes we're gonna use civil rights movements
[38:02.800 --> 38:06.280]  to get people to accept the blurring then we're gonna start attacking the
[38:06.280 --> 38:10.000]  male and female gender and then we're gonna sterilize everybody's so bad you
[38:10.000 --> 38:13.480]  can't even have children except for laboratory genetically engineered
[38:13.480 --> 38:17.400]  creatures that we the elite create as our servants but this will be the
[38:17.400 --> 38:21.480]  orderly phasing out of things and then he badmouth George Arwell saying it's
[38:21.480 --> 38:27.320]  not gonna be a 1984 situation with Jack Boots and stuff that's just for the few
[38:27.320 --> 38:31.720]  that are immune that we have to mop up it's gonna be done culturally to make
[38:31.720 --> 38:38.120]  you love your servitude and his brother created UNESCO that runs at higher
[38:38.120 --> 38:42.720]  education and runs the universities and runs the high schools and runs the
[38:42.720 --> 38:48.040]  elementary schools and runs the kindergartens and runs the preschools
[38:48.040 --> 38:52.360]  globally the same names the same programs are in Germany that are in
[38:52.360 --> 38:57.160]  Australia that are in Austria that are in the United States that are in Canada
[38:57.160 --> 39:01.760]  and now even in Mexico and places like that if you want the foreign aid you go
[39:01.760 --> 39:07.240]  on to this program and then the Tavistock Institute sits in amongst the
[39:07.240 --> 39:14.320]  other big institutes and it runs the trans program for the sexual allotment
[39:14.320 --> 39:18.560]  of three-year-olds now I have that here on the news preparing them in the UK
[39:18.560 --> 39:24.520]  schools for your interview about changing your sex and then that the MI6
[39:24.520 --> 39:33.320]  OSS UN program basically prepares you for your dehumanization but no one can
[39:33.320 --> 39:37.800]  protect the children surrounded by psych warfare chiefs and actual government
[39:37.800 --> 39:42.640]  spies running a biological operation against them because oh these are
[39:42.640 --> 39:47.480]  experts here to help the child be empowered not mommy and daddy and it's
[39:47.480 --> 39:51.360]  not pedophilia it's not sexualization even though Tavistock was admittedly
[39:51.360 --> 39:56.520]  involved in the sexual trauma and mind control and drugging of children from
[39:56.520 --> 40:02.360]  its founding along with Dr. Ewing Cameron and Jolly in West and MK Ultra and
[40:02.360 --> 40:08.600]  MK Naomi all on the history channel even they even have history channel shows
[40:08.600 --> 40:14.080]  about 10,000 plus foster children taken mind controlled sexually controlled
[40:14.080 --> 40:22.640]  turned into sex slaves operatives but it's okay because it's liberal it's okay
[40:22.640 --> 40:26.360]  if Hillary goes and does voodoo rituals and her best buddy talks about how she
[40:26.360 --> 40:30.480]  kills people in black magic rituals and it's even in her own memoirs it's okay
[40:30.480 --> 40:35.400]  if you got 16 mayors stepping down or arrested for pedophilia it's okay of the
[40:35.400 --> 40:42.040]  deputy popes doing it it's okay because it's liberal and they're gonna tell us
[40:42.040 --> 40:45.280]  how to talk and they're gonna tell us not to be mothers or fathers because
[40:45.280 --> 40:49.280]  that's hurtful and they're gonna take the names off the forms and say g or z
[40:49.280 --> 40:53.200]  and they're going to tell us how to communicate they're gonna destroy the
[40:53.200 --> 40:57.640]  language and pull down all the statues and take control because they got a big
[40:57.640 --> 41:11.680]  beautiful vision for you let me tell you but let me before I get into all that
[41:13.400 --> 41:22.200]  let me get into the more contemporary news let's let's set all of their plans
[41:22.200 --> 41:26.320]  for all of us that are already well afoot that we're already in the quick
[41:26.320 --> 41:32.000]  stand up to our chins and they're there on the bank just saying go on under it's
[41:32.000 --> 41:39.880]  fun you'll like it there's carnival rides down here just like it says there's

[42:24.040 --> 42:31.960]  conversion just five years ago 70% of so-called liberals meant well we're
[42:31.960 --> 42:36.240]  going along with it try to be good people and help others and you know stop
[42:36.240 --> 42:39.880]  bad people involved in in culture but they kind of wanted to be in charge and
[42:39.880 --> 42:44.160]  that was their social structure and it was only 30% on top that were really
[42:44.160 --> 42:47.960]  pedophiles devil worshipers knew it was about power knew it was about
[42:47.960 --> 42:52.400]  overthrowing everything knew it was about just doing bad things as their
[42:52.400 --> 42:58.320]  religion a spirit want to go to church to get this thing you don't have to buy a

[49:02.560 --> 49:10.120]  personally 105 million bucks on the bank and they then hate you if you've got a
[49:10.120 --> 49:17.360]  $300,000 house and a $50,000 car and absolutely disdain anyone that goes and
[49:17.360 --> 49:22.160]  stays in a nice hotel or or goes to a golf course or goes to church or likes
[49:22.160 --> 49:28.080]  to dress nice you're bad but they love the elites so what they don't like is
[49:28.080 --> 49:32.400]  prosperity in your hands they want you to be under government-run health care
[49:32.400 --> 49:36.440]  they want you to be controlled they want to engineer your life because that's
[49:36.440 --> 49:40.680]  their power through extension they've already given themselves over to this
[49:40.680 --> 49:48.080]  and so they now want you to submit to it so it's about a choice just like they
[49:48.080 --> 49:51.720]  want to bully you into taking vaccines and will lie to you and say safe and

[50:12.280 --> 50:16.080]  you'll just be brain damaged and get cancer down the road because it's so
[50:16.080 --> 50:21.800]  good and they take all the doctors in during their training now and they
[50:21.800 --> 50:25.920]  tell them yes vaccines are hurting people and causing brain damage and it's
[50:25.920 --> 50:30.120]  your job to make sure the public takes it or hang it up you're not a doctor

[56:13.560 --> 56:17.800]  here for a long time from the time of a child school records stuff like that
[56:17.800 --> 56:22.560]  there has to be a process and it must be passed by Congress and he says he'll do
[56:22.560 --> 56:26.040]  it which doesn't really go back on his promise he said he'd get rid of this
[56:26.040 --> 56:29.280]  dream act because it was an executive order and try to have something more
[56:29.280 --> 56:33.880]  streamlined that stopped hardened criminals but meanwhile he's being hit
[56:33.880 --> 56:38.240]  with a double hoax Pelosi and Schumer knowing it would hurt him with his base
[56:38.240 --> 56:42.520]  said that he'd agreed to the dream act and no wall no proof no statements no
[56:42.520 --> 56:45.360]  nothing the Republicans piled on against him saying okay we're done with
[56:45.360 --> 56:50.400]  Trump hours later he said we're we have no agreement that's not true we've got
[56:50.400 --> 56:55.280]  to do something in Congress with this and I'm not gonna sign a new executive
[56:55.280 --> 56:59.680]  order on this that's unconstitutional and he said we'll get our wall first we've
[56:59.680 --> 57:02.600]  got a deal with the latest spending packages and all the rest of it we've
[57:02.600 --> 57:06.920]  already started the wall in Texas and Arizona but they spin all of it with
[57:06.920 --> 57:12.520]  lies on top of lies on top of lies so the one lie is he's going for it the
[57:12.520 --> 57:15.880]  other lies you're gonna be putting a concentration camp concentration camp
[57:15.880 --> 57:20.400]  say military war camp we're gonna be basically work to death let's go ahead
[57:20.400 --> 57:26.000]  and play Nancy Pelosi talking on the both sides of her flapping jaws we can
[57:26.000 --> 57:31.520]  have a go as in Chicago and I saw this art exhibit that I was invited to see
[57:31.520 --> 57:39.840]  it's called and then they came for me and it's about the internment of the
[57:39.840 --> 57:46.480]  Japanese-American patriots in our country who were interred in and turned
[57:46.480 --> 57:51.880]  into camps during World War two while their family members were fighting for
[57:51.880 --> 57:57.440]  freedom for America and for the world in World War two they were in camps and
[57:57.440 --> 58:03.800]  they came for me and now they're coming for the dreamers this is something
[58:03.800 --> 58:08.960]  that's we owe these dreamers for their patriotism their courage their
[58:08.960 --> 58:15.920]  optimism to come forward but it's about America too but the fight is for who we
[58:15.920 --> 58:21.360]  are as a country they are the manifestation of that fight right now
[58:21.360 --> 58:24.480]  oh you mean like all the towns across the country letting illegal aliens vote
[58:24.480 --> 58:29.480]  and stuff like that well you deny you're trying to steal the elections it's
[58:29.480 --> 58:32.800]  conservatives and libertarians that are being put in electronic good logs and
[58:32.800 --> 58:36.440]  censored and being banned from speaking around the country you're coming for us
[58:36.440 --> 58:40.760]  witch so we're fighting back and get ready to have your big ugly ass
[58:40.760 --> 58:51.560]  politically handed back to you you've seen I owe which yeah thousands of
[58:51.560 --> 58:56.120]  years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the
[58:56.120 --> 59:01.160]  drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare
[59:01.160 --> 59:07.080]  a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with
[59:07.080 --> 59:12.280]  bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century
[59:12.280 --> 59:17.480]  there are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water
[59:17.480 --> 59:22.480]  and the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and
[59:22.480 --> 59:27.400]  accelerate our journey towards death I personally counter this onslaught with
[59:27.400 --> 59:33.920]  antroplex antroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to

[1:00:31.880 --> 1:00:35.680]  micro chipping you name it but mark dice has got a good report here dealing with
[1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:40.480]  the fact that well now Hillary they took thousands of one stars away from her book
[1:00:40.480 --> 1:00:44.520]  to prop it up at four and a half stars but the book is sinking like a lead
[1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:48.680]  balloon despite being force-fed to everybody right now so here's mark dice
[1:00:48.680 --> 1:00:53.800]  show reporting on it great news guys Hillary Clinton has a new book which
[1:00:53.800 --> 1:00:58.800]  just came out today it's 512 pages of excuses of why she lost the election
[1:00:58.800 --> 1:01:03.440]  called what happened no I'm not joking this is actually the cover which
[1:01:03.440 --> 1:01:07.720]  obviously her graphic designer put as much work into creating as she did into
[1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:11.360]  campaigning in Wisconsin in Michigan obviously it's been a great 10-month
[1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:14.880]  since we've all had a good time laughing at the liberal lunatics having complete
[1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:19.560]  meltdowns over their beloved Hillary losing and over the horrors of President
[1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:23.640]  Trump now being in charge but now thanks to Hillary we all get to relive those
[1:01:23.640 --> 1:01:27.360]  first amazing few weeks after the election as she's now going on a book
[1:01:27.360 --> 1:01:32.800]  tour and explaining in detail her devastating loss so Hillary how's life
[1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:41.120]  have you been I think I am good but that doesn't mean that I am complacent or
[1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:47.300]  resolved about what happened it still is very painful it hurts a lot that's
[1:01:47.300 --> 1:01:50.520]  really too bad Hillary but you still have millions of Americans who still
[1:01:50.520 --> 1:01:54.000]  love and support you can you give them some assurance that you're not so
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:00.680]  depressed that you won't commit suicide anytime soon no okay then let's move on
[1:02:00.680 --> 1:02:03.880]  to something else many Americans are wondering why you waited until the next
[1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:07.680]  afternoon to give your concession speech was drunk of election night after it
[1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:15.880]  was clear that you had been defeated I had not drafted a concession speech she
[1:02:15.880 --> 1:02:19.720]  was so sure that she was gonna win that nobody on her team even after the
[1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:23.840]  concession speech which is common practice for both candidates because
[1:02:23.840 --> 1:02:28.560]  anything can happen the arrogance of this demon is just astounding the
[1:02:28.560 --> 1:02:32.240]  city was CBS gets even better she admits that she bought this house which is
[1:02:32.240 --> 1:02:36.760]  right next door to the White House to accommodate staff and security in the
[1:02:36.760 --> 1:02:41.080]  expectation that she was going to win and become the president she literally
[1:02:41.080 --> 1:02:44.880]  now owns a house right next door to the White House which is completely
[1:02:44.880 --> 1:02:49.320]  worthless and does nothing other than serve as a painful reminder of her
[1:02:49.320 --> 1:02:55.280]  devastating loss doesn't it kind of haunt you no I'm very happy we did it
[1:02:55.280 --> 1:03:00.080]  she's such a horrible actress no I'm glad that we did it now Hillary we've
[1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:03.320]  heard you blame just about everyone and everything for your loss except for
[1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:07.520]  yourself from fake news to the Russians to James Comey is there anybody else
[1:03:07.520 --> 1:03:11.200]  you'd like to add to that list millions of white people yeah millions of white
[1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:15.320]  people by the way I didn't take that clip out of context that's literally one
[1:03:15.320 --> 1:03:19.080]  of her excuses in the book she even blames party Sanders the guy that heard
[1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:23.720]  her campaign and the DNC conspired against during the primaries which
[1:03:23.720 --> 1:03:27.880]  caused DNC chairperson Debbie Worcestershire sauce Schultz to have to
[1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:33.640]  resign Hillary wrote his attacks caused lasting damage making it harder to
[1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:37.960]  unify progressives and the general election and paving the way for Trump's
[1:03:37.960 --> 1:03:42.120]  crooked Hillary campaign just keep doing what you're doing Democrats it's
[1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:45.680]  working fantastic for us conservatives but Hillary I mean you got to at least
[1:03:45.680 --> 1:03:49.320]  admit that when you called half of Donald Trump supporters deplorable that
[1:03:49.320 --> 1:03:54.000]  was a major misstep and it backfired big time right I don't buy that I don't buy
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:57.880]  that I'm sorry I gave him a political gift of any kind that was a gift but I
[1:03:57.880 --> 1:04:03.000]  don't think that was determinative nothing to do with it well nobody
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.920]  could pay me enough money to waste my time reading this book the reviews are
[1:04:05.920 --> 1:04:11.280]  coming in from people like Chris Hayes over at MSNBC says quote I'm reading the
[1:04:11.280 --> 1:04:15.800]  Clinton book and it's quite good compelling and candid and written with a
[1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:21.920]  pretty remarkable intimacy it's worth reading stop sucking up hope that she'll
[1:04:21.920 --> 1:04:26.080]  come on your stupid show you know that this book was a horrible idea I mean
[1:04:26.080 --> 1:04:29.720]  for us of course it's great but for the Democrats this is just disastrous
[1:04:29.720 --> 1:04:33.600]  speaking of new books I have a new book that's coming out soon probably in
[1:04:33.600 --> 1:04:37.640]  December I've been working on it for a year and a half and it's almost done
[1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:42.120]  it's gonna be so good I'll give you a sneak peek here in a couple weeks and
[1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:46.000]  by the way guys thank you mark I used to carry his books I want to carry this
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:50.360]  new book so please tell shipping and procurement I want to get that book and
[1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:55.520]  I want to get dice on more he is just awesome it was Thomas Jefferson who
[1:04:55.520 --> 1:04:58.720]  once said that our country is now taking so steady of course as to show by what
[1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:02.800]  rodeo will pass to destruction to wit by consolidation of power first and in
[1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:06.360]  corruption it's necessary consequence Jefferson was warning us about the
[1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:10.160]  global elite the 1% of the 1% consolidating the world's wealth and
[1:05:10.160 --> 1:05:13.320]  subverting the people's voice in government unfortunately we didn't
[1:05:13.320 --> 1:05:16.760]  heed his advice we now live in a neo feudalistic society in which we're
[1:05:16.760 --> 1:05:19.760]  treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the
[1:05:19.760 --> 1:05:23.040]  establishment political office no longer represents the voice of the people
[1:05:23.040 --> 1:05:26.240]  but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain
[1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:29.960]  acceptance into the aristocracy simply put we the people are responsible for
[1:05:29.960 --> 1:05:32.880]  civilization and culture yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have
[1:05:32.880 --> 1:05:36.000]  organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world we
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:39.720]  falsely believe that everything is simply black and white one extreme against
[1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:43.200]  the other conservative versus liberal but things will change once more of us
[1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:46.640]  realize this truth as Thomas Jefferson also said in light of the people
[1:05:46.640 --> 1:05:50.240]  generally in tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil

[1:08:53.520 --> 1:08:58.800]  locked in a brutal primary battle with Hillary Clinton four years later she
[1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:18.280]  won't stop drunk texting me
[1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:22.680]  Hillary Clinton was in Cartagena for the summit of the Americas and partied
[1:09:22.680 --> 1:09:29.680]  a bit today local watering hole they ordered 12 beers a couple glasses of whisky
[1:09:29.680 --> 1:09:57.480]  I think you've had one too many Hillary let's go have a lot of people since then
[1:09:57.480 --> 1:10:00.960]  since inauguration day in the last eight months coming up to you with their
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:05.680]  daughters and saying my daughter didn't go out to vote and sort of wanting
[1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:11.040]  absolution from right that happened to me what's more common are people bursting
[1:10:11.040 --> 1:10:16.440]  at a tears welling up I had a lot of that at my book signing yesterday here
[1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:27.080]  thanks for having me so the American people would really like to know what
[1:10:27.080 --> 1:10:31.320]  happened to your 33,000 emails do you give the
[1:10:31.320 --> 1:10:37.240]  up solution to those who didn't vote to women who didn't know I don't look I
[1:10:37.240 --> 1:10:41.960]  when it first started happening it was so soon after the election and the
[1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:47.800]  election was so bizarre and close it was hard for me to you know comfort
[1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:52.440]  somebody who was coming to me and saying oh I wish I'd done more or I'm sorry I
[1:10:52.440 --> 1:10:56.960]  didn't vote because I think this was one of the most consequential elections
[1:10:56.960 --> 1:11:01.120]  that you know we have faced in a long time so no absolution
[1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:08.520]  hey I'm just so darn bummed all anyone wants to talk about is Donald Trump
[1:11:08.520 --> 1:11:17.460]  Donald Trump isn't either one that's like you're all losers that almost
[1:11:17.460 --> 1:11:23.320]  humanizes Hillary Clinton the fact that she's a drunk until you realize that she
[1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:29.320]  is a total psychopath not sociopath but a real psychopath when you study her
[1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:35.160]  entire career getting fired off the Watergate Commission is a top aid for
[1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:40.160]  falsifying evidence against people perjuring herself the first people she
[1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:45.240]  represent were like rape gangs of men that would rape 11 and 12 year old
[1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:50.280]  girls so hard they could never have kids again I don't want to go into medical
[1:11:50.280 --> 1:11:54.880]  stuff here on air a lot of children might be listening but I don't think most
[1:11:54.880 --> 1:11:59.000]  adults know about the kind of stuff they can go on unless she worked in medicine
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:03.520]  or worked as a large animal vet but I've seen what happens to cows that say get
[1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:07.960]  hit by a car have problems giving birth but you know some of these little girls
[1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:12.680]  got raped so hard one in particular that it tore insides out her insides came
[1:12:12.680 --> 1:12:17.480]  out Hillary thinks that's funny so I'm sorry to talk about stuff like that but
[1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:24.280]  I have three daughters and there's a particular type of just absolute hatred
[1:12:24.280 --> 1:12:33.200]  that just a just a cold complete absolute level of doom that I have for
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:37.280]  people that are like this who are willfully evil that think it's strong
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:42.280]  to be evil that think it's strong to do bad things that think it's it's good to
[1:12:42.280 --> 1:12:47.880]  hurt innocence that that shows how much will they've got well your will will be
[1:12:47.880 --> 1:12:52.840]  broken now Larry Nichols hadn't been on a long time because he's been fighting
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:56.560]  cancer and been very ill she was a lot of good info of the years but he was the
[1:12:56.560 --> 1:13:04.360]  first guy I ever heard 21 years ago I've been on there 22 years but 21 years ago
[1:13:04.360 --> 1:13:10.760]  saying that Hillary was in DeVuda and then I saw it in a few newspapers here
[1:13:10.760 --> 1:13:15.400]  in there over the years her going to Voodoo events in New Orleans and Los
[1:13:15.400 --> 1:13:20.800]  Angeles and but is it Port-au-Prince what's the what's the main capital of
[1:13:20.800 --> 1:13:26.440]  Haiti I got the articles here in stack and he's gonna be joining us suddenly
[1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:30.840]  it's in the Washington Post and it's in memoirs and and and they're just saying
[1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:36.520]  yeah we're we're we're not just in the Voodoo we do black magic and we kill
[1:13:36.520 --> 1:13:43.120]  people I know I covered this extensively yesterday but I wanted to have him
[1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:49.600]  just back on to see what it's like in hindsight to talk about back when he was
[1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:53.080]  a fixer for them when they were governors and then he got one of the
[1:13:53.080 --> 1:13:56.680]  fixers on during the campaign who'd worked for Hillary you know in the
[1:13:56.680 --> 1:14:01.600]  National Enquirer who talked about her and the occult and the other weird stuff
[1:14:01.600 --> 1:14:09.320]  I mean Hillary Clinton gets on her knees to the devil let's put that headline
[1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:13.240]  back on screen for TV viewers I'm gonna read it for radio listeners flashback
[1:14:13.240 --> 1:14:17.920]  admitted occultist Sally Quinn ridiculed Sarah Palin's Christian faith that's a
[1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:21.240]  new Breitbart article yeah I love that Breitbart's there because they've got more
[1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:25.520]  writers and people than we do and they're on the beat of Satanism and occult
[1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:29.000]  and and and when the establishment talks about how much they love the devil
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:35.440]  or when Sally Quinn talks about how she's killed people her words not mine
[1:14:35.440 --> 1:14:41.560]  she's the top you know socialite friends with the Hillary throwing parties for
[1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:48.600]  Nancy Pelosi and either they're totally crazy and think they're
[1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:56.400]  Baltimore in that the bad guy in Harry Potter Voldemort or this stuff's real
[1:14:56.400 --> 1:15:03.640]  and they're crazy so again ladies and gentlemen that's coming up but let's
[1:15:03.640 --> 1:15:08.600]  talk about market the beast right now let's get into market the beast right
[1:15:08.600 --> 1:15:15.400]  now because this article oh gosh they just pulled up another one print all
[1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:19.160]  these the I haven't even seen these print all these we got to create a Satanism
[1:15:19.160 --> 1:15:24.360]  watch section on info wars and on news wars that because there's just not enough
[1:15:24.360 --> 1:15:28.040]  room on the front page where we're just posting all this in real time I need to
[1:15:28.040 --> 1:15:33.000]  put like two reporters full-time just on the Satanism beat because they're all
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:38.240]  coming out now yeah go back to that I actually heard this on NPR a few days
[1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:41.720]  ago and I forgot about it Planned Parenthood teams up with Satanist to
[1:15:41.720 --> 1:15:47.280]  promote abortion in Missouri I shouldn't laugh how many times you hear about an
[1:15:47.280 --> 1:15:51.680]  abortionist getting busted because they're keeping babies alive or they're
[1:15:51.680 --> 1:15:56.280]  doing rituals or they're having sex with the corpses and then they'll argue in
[1:15:56.280 --> 1:16:01.360]  court it's my religion I'm a Satanist because they'll have nurses in there at
[1:16:01.360 --> 1:16:05.880]  these abortuaries where they're doing the partial birth I mean who wants even to
[1:16:05.880 --> 1:16:09.840]  believe in abortion to kill seven eight nine month old babies that are
[1:16:09.840 --> 1:16:14.640]  operable outside the womb and would be given up to adoption people will pay you
[1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:18.840]  up to a hundred grand for those babies through legal systems why do they want
[1:16:18.840 --> 1:16:23.000]  to go kill them why is a woman gonna pay three thousand dollars to have a
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:26.600]  partial birth abortion done what will they number one they're selling the
[1:16:26.600 --> 1:16:31.040]  body parts the mothers don't know it they're ignorant but sometimes it's a
[1:16:31.040 --> 1:16:35.120]  satanic ritual and they go ahead and take the baby out and they get me kill it
[1:16:35.120 --> 1:16:39.720]  right there and the mother's involved and I've talked to law enforcement it's
[1:16:39.720 --> 1:16:46.840]  come out the news you can just search engine abortion doctor was a Satanist
[1:16:46.840 --> 1:16:51.520]  or you can search top Nazi doctor then travel to Latin America to be an
[1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:55.200]  abortionist and it was also an occultist I mean you see this everywhere well of
[1:16:55.200 --> 1:17:03.500]  course who wants to kill nine month old babies devil worshipers so I got
[1:17:03.500 --> 1:17:06.680]  digressed just because they were putting those on screen great job crew a lot
[1:17:06.680 --> 1:17:09.480]  of times the crew controls the show because I say something they search
[1:17:09.480 --> 1:17:12.880]  engine it and then stuff I didn't even know just starts popping up I mean it's
[1:17:12.880 --> 1:17:18.040]  just it's always worse than I say it's always better than I say to good people
[1:17:18.040 --> 1:17:21.560]  are better than I can say bad people are worse than I could say that's the way
[1:17:21.560 --> 1:17:26.080]  the world is can't describe the best meal you ever had can't describe that
[1:17:26.080 --> 1:17:30.520]  first kiss with your wife you can't describe the magic moments of your life
[1:17:30.520 --> 1:17:37.280]  you can't describe the horrible ones either one has to experience it can you
[1:17:37.280 --> 1:17:43.280]  describe watching a Corvette race in a Camaro at 150 miles an hour flipping and
[1:17:43.280 --> 1:17:46.280]  watching the bodies fly out of the vehicles and their heads get chopped
[1:17:46.280 --> 1:17:53.960]  off no you can't you got to see it and I could see it right now former Satanist
[1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:59.080]  I performed satanic rituals inside abortion clinics boom life site then it
[1:17:59.080 --> 1:18:04.680]  linked all the mainstream news articles right there and see to then abuse and
[1:18:04.680 --> 1:18:09.560]  desecrate the bodies is the lesser magic that's why they use their body parts
[1:18:09.560 --> 1:18:12.680]  that's why they keep them alive so they make fun of their bodies it's why they
[1:18:12.680 --> 1:18:17.920]  shoot videos about it it's why they have sex with the dead bodies it's they take
[1:18:17.920 --> 1:18:21.720]  little cute desperate baby and then they sit there with a scalp on the baby even
[1:18:21.720 --> 1:18:26.760]  at nine months is fighting and they go look how tough I am and just I love
[1:18:26.760 --> 1:18:29.520]  you Satan I love you Satan is the baby bags and they all run over and start
[1:18:29.520 --> 1:18:33.360]  drinking the blood and slurping and they all have sex with each other and then
[1:18:33.360 --> 1:18:37.480]  they just pledge to get your kids and pledge to overthrow God and pledge to
[1:18:37.480 --> 1:18:41.000]  overthrow prosperity and when they drive through the countryside and see your
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:45.240]  nice cut fields and your pretty little farmhouses and your nice kids they want

[1:24:39.120 --> 1:24:44.240]  began to expose the Clintons the Clinton Chronicles documentaries all the basic
[1:24:44.240 --> 1:24:48.320]  original stuff we know about the Clintons that undoubtedly stopped them
[1:24:48.320 --> 1:24:54.600]  later from their complete takeover didn't work early on but certainly held
[1:24:54.600 --> 1:24:59.160]  them back slowed them down got Clinton impeached but wasn't for Larry Nichols

[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:07.600]  paddle but I remember interviewing him 21 years ago he's one of the first
[1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:13.040]  people I started interviewing back in 1995 when I first got on radio and TV I
[1:25:13.040 --> 1:25:20.240]  was 21 years old and I remember Larry Nichols going and this is another thing
[1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:27.160]  this is another thing I can copy his voice his mind's almost as raspy when
[1:25:27.160 --> 1:25:31.840]  she goes out to California or to Haiti she does voodoo rituals and she's real
[1:25:31.840 --> 1:25:36.880]  serious about it and she's involved in a bunch of other stuff and told people that
[1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:41.440]  she was you know betting on the side she thought was gonna win these are all
[1:25:41.440 --> 1:25:45.240]  quotes from Nichols and you've heard him a few years ago talking about it now
[1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:49.840]  look at it in the news this is the Washington Post that time Bill and
[1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:54.600]  Hillary Clinton went to a voodoo ceremony in Haiti why are they suddenly
[1:25:54.600 --> 1:25:58.000]  saying this because they know it's in the WikiLeaks they're putting it out I
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:02.440]  believe I haven't talked to Nichols yet we won't a second to protect themselves
[1:26:02.440 --> 1:26:07.840]  here they are in their new memoir of the former head of the Washington Post and
[1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:14.120]  his wife the top socialites in DC Sally Quinn comes out as an occultist use her

[1:27:18.200 --> 1:27:37.840]  spot old devil old Lucifer Larry why do you think they're doing that
[1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:47.000]  they want to go back to what Hillary did back when I was with her when I had to
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:51.440]  figure out a way to pay for trips up to LA with Linda Bloodmore Thomas to go to
[1:27:51.440 --> 1:27:59.200]  the same churches or what are the column and you know that's that she thinks is
[1:27:59.200 --> 1:28:04.320]  the root of her power and she's getting back to it and declaring it and I know
[1:28:04.320 --> 1:28:07.480]  you're a Christian so I'm a but if you study the occult they believe declaring
[1:28:07.480 --> 1:28:11.000]  it increases the power and you just answered the question that that's what
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:15.320]  I believe they're doing it to throw it in our face to inoculate us but also so
[1:28:15.320 --> 1:28:19.240]  that comes out as shocking under Satanism you must declare your faith to
[1:28:19.240 --> 1:28:23.120]  Satan that increases your power so she believes she didn't win because she
[1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:27.840]  didn't openly worship her Lord and Savior that's right I mean you know she
[1:28:27.840 --> 1:28:33.160]  didn't call in that side into the race and she thanks for her to get her power
[1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:41.000]  back she's gonna have to come out you know Alex I tried to tell you back 21
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:49.080]  years ago and what sounded crazy but these people these people are evil buddy
[1:28:49.080 --> 1:28:56.120]  it's pure evil in the bad news is they have spread it around you know they've
[1:28:56.120 --> 1:29:01.960]  got Alex they've got horrible evers in that junk in Washington you can imagine

[1:29:13.560 --> 1:29:16.760]  just like the Bible says over and over again we ought to pull the passages you
[1:29:16.760 --> 1:29:20.360]  have to declare the name of Jesus and you know that I mean that happens that
[1:29:20.360 --> 1:29:24.560]  first night they're about to crucify Christ but that before and which one of
[1:29:24.560 --> 1:29:28.400]  the disciples was it refused him he said before the cockroach you'll refuse me
[1:29:28.400 --> 1:29:34.360]  three times without the doubting Thomas so you we have to declare Jesus Christ
[1:29:34.360 --> 1:29:38.880]  we have to declare our belief in Jesus Christ and our commitment that we stand
[1:29:38.880 --> 1:29:44.040]  on Christ they are standing on Satan we stand on Jesus Christ we're on the March

[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:30.080]  not doubting Thomas the Christ said you'll deny me three times for the
[1:33:30.080 --> 1:33:33.880]  cockroaches Thomas doubted it was Jesus we should stick your hand in the in the
[1:33:33.880 --> 1:33:39.320]  wound in my side it was Peter on this rock I'll build my church that he said
[1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:42.920]  three times for the cockroach you'll deny me again I went to Sunday school went
[1:33:42.920 --> 1:33:46.440]  to church I don't plan to have it have it all down I was just getting to the
[1:33:46.440 --> 1:33:52.160]  fact that I say who are you to liberals and they go Satan or the devil or your
[1:33:52.160 --> 1:33:56.720]  enemy or your mama and they'll never intellectually talk to us it's like when
[1:33:56.720 --> 1:34:03.120]  Christ says to the homeless guy you know who are you demon and he goes we are
[1:34:03.120 --> 1:34:08.280]  Legion and Christ says come out of them they go running a bunch of pigs and the
[1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:12.760]  pigs run off the side of a cliff and I used to sit there and listen to that
[1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:17.000]  Sunday school and quite frankly roll my eyes and then you go out you fight these
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:20.480]  evil people and they tell you we are Satanists we are devil worshipers we
[1:34:20.480 --> 1:34:26.480]  want to hurt kids we want to kill kids I go out to these abortion protest and the
[1:34:26.480 --> 1:34:31.000]  people that are for abortion show up their antifa we have video all over the
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:36.200]  country of it and they say we love Satan we kill our kids and they try to block
[1:34:36.200 --> 1:34:41.360]  our free speech with black tarps and they tell you we are into being failures
[1:34:41.360 --> 1:34:52.080]  we are into being ugly we love the devil and they're literally like zombies and
[1:34:52.080 --> 1:35:00.120]  it's the craziest thing you've ever seen yeah one of the videos is the abortion
[1:35:00.120 --> 1:35:03.920]  team done done done done done done you know I'm going back to Larry Nichols
[1:35:03.920 --> 1:35:07.840]  right now since he brought all this up but let's play the abortion team for
[1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:12.080]  folks a little piece of Derek Green put together that that's an intro we have
[1:35:12.080 --> 1:35:16.680]  long serious videos like communist attack Alex Jones at abortion clinic and
[1:35:16.680 --> 1:35:21.280]  things like that and they're just vicious scum of the earth but the media
[1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:25.880]  props them up as the paragon of goodness but Trump said you know the white
[1:35:25.880 --> 1:35:29.800]  supremacist are bad and so are these people oh my gosh you're the worst guy
[1:35:29.800 --> 1:35:37.280]  in the world and then it turned out that Trump was right three weeks later they
[1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:40.040]  had to decry them so that was a big victory but we're gonna find out about
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:45.560]  the devil worship we're gonna find out about you know how far this goes how
[1:35:45.560 --> 1:35:49.440]  big it is in DC from the guy that I first heard about it from specifically
[1:35:49.440 --> 1:35:53.960]  voodoo and occult rituals and Hillary and now she's in the news she's in her
[1:35:53.960 --> 1:35:59.600]  new book her friends are in the news saying we kill people with voodoo well
[1:35:59.600 --> 1:36:04.800]  one way or another they're crazy Larry Nichols dot news that's his official
[1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:08.760]  site Larry Nichols dot news got a book out a lot of their stuff is a great guy
[1:36:08.760 --> 1:36:11.440]  be sure and support Larry Nichols we're going back to him just a moment but
[1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:15.940]  here is the abortion team that's just got a few of the clips of the folks
[1:36:15.940 --> 1:36:18.680]  saying they love Satan they love the devil and they're not doing to be
[1:36:18.680 --> 1:36:23.040]  shocking that they tell me I kill my kids in a ritual through abortion here it
[1:36:23.040 --> 1:36:29.960]  is in today's world abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and
[1:36:29.960 --> 1:36:35.920]  attempt to bully activists if you have a problem and need a smelly group of
[1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:43.120]  commie devil worshipers maybe you can call the 18
[1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:48.880]  how many did I assault I kill my kids I kill my kids
[1:36:54.880 --> 1:36:58.320]  hey we saw your face but with your communist hammer and sickle that's
[1:36:58.320 --> 1:37:05.040]  pretty cool man is that you on the Facebook is there a Facebook page of
[1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:08.600]  you with a hammer and sickle I don't think so
[1:37:08.600 --> 1:37:25.880]  I paid for them upwards of 50 oh yeah
[1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:33.480]  you piece of bunch misogynist mother take your meal privilege somewhere else
[1:37:33.480 --> 1:37:42.960]  probably being aggressive I'm being aggressive these that's the guys that
[1:37:42.960 --> 1:37:59.880]  attack out from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones so the
[1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:04.520]  people I face everywhere say I love Satan and we're going to kill you and
[1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:09.880]  your family and I say what do you want they go death and then you read the
[1:38:09.880 --> 1:38:16.200]  Bible and it's like what do you want I want death it's the same same deal so
[1:38:16.200 --> 1:38:21.360]  I'm not here pushing any fake litterbug churches and all this I'm just telling
[1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:25.160]  you bottom line ladies and gentlemen that what got Larry Nichols to start
[1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:28.920]  standing up against this evil was when he found Christ and it wasn't in some
[1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:33.200]  church it was it was it was getting right with God so Larry I'm ranting here
[1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:36.720]  let's get it to the occult those that just joined us suddenly it's the
[1:38:36.720 --> 1:38:40.440]  Washington Post the Hill and Beverly Clinton traveled Haiti just to do voodoo
[1:38:40.440 --> 1:38:44.600]  rituals that they're part of satanic temples that their friends believe they're
[1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:48.720]  killing people in DC with it I know I know you've worked some in DC mainly in
[1:38:48.720 --> 1:38:53.560]  Arkansas when they were governors but but I mean I always thought it was just a
[1:38:53.560 --> 1:38:57.840]  system of power for them to manipulate people like these guys that tell girls
[1:38:57.840 --> 1:39:00.800]  oh I'm really in the Illuminati you'll have sex with me and I'll tell you the
[1:39:00.800 --> 1:39:04.480]  secrets because we know there's some scams going but when I went to Bohemian
[1:39:04.480 --> 1:39:09.880]  Grove and watch those men watch the ritual that was just a gateway drug you
[1:39:09.880 --> 1:39:12.720]  know like Satanism's heroin this was just the marijuana this was just the
[1:39:12.720 --> 1:39:16.960]  gateway drug but still they were taking it very serious it was very occulting it
[1:39:16.960 --> 1:39:24.720]  was a Faustian ritual to put their sins onto a sacrifice Larry Nichols well
[1:39:24.720 --> 1:39:29.320]  Alex what they're doing is if you watch what they have done everything they do
[1:39:29.320 --> 1:39:35.960]  they do gradually now they're starting to pull it all out you know Alex I'm
[1:39:35.960 --> 1:39:41.320]  telling you I'm begging people to understand we're at the end times of
[1:39:41.320 --> 1:39:46.840]  this country if you can't see it you know Sunday I was called by three people
[1:39:46.840 --> 1:39:52.120]  of what would be called high positions in Washington and every one of all three
[1:39:52.120 --> 1:39:55.800]  were separate calls and they were saying Nichols you got to do something
[1:39:55.800 --> 1:40:04.040]  we're about to come unglued they're bringing in people folks this Satanism
[1:40:04.040 --> 1:40:09.080]  stuff we all sit here and think well haha that's funny it's not funny it's
[1:40:09.080 --> 1:40:13.800]  very pervasive in Washington DC and they can laugh at us they can call us
[1:40:13.800 --> 1:40:18.880]  names all they want to but you need to be in the parties you need to be with them
[1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:25.120]  and you'll see it's not and that's where they want the power and that's what
[1:40:25.120 --> 1:40:30.680]  Hillary feels like she let down you know Hillary could not pull off the trick of
[1:40:30.680 --> 1:40:35.560]  claiming she was just great Christian you know that one didn't fly it was she
[1:40:35.560 --> 1:40:41.000]  messed up in her mind and she didn't come out and give her satanic roots
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:48.880]  because in the in the theory that we used you know which was this if you take
[1:40:48.880 --> 1:40:52.480]  all of the different elements of society the hippies the hippies the
[1:40:52.480 --> 1:40:56.360]  homosexuals and all these different groups you put them all together and
[1:40:56.360 --> 1:41:01.640]  you've got a big enough group to win boats one of the group that's bigger
[1:41:01.640 --> 1:41:09.200]  than people think is Satanism now it connects very directly I think you know
[1:41:09.200 --> 1:41:17.040]  Alex to Islam to Islam oh but it's the same thing it is don't be confused
[1:41:17.040 --> 1:41:22.960]  folks a lot of times when they're masking it by talking about Islam it's not
[1:41:22.960 --> 1:41:29.080]  really what they're talking about you know Alex we're gonna impeach Trump if
[1:41:29.080 --> 1:41:34.640]  we don't stop well let's talk about that then because because you've broken down
[1:41:34.640 --> 1:41:40.080]  I remember a year ago that if Trump won they do this special counsel he said but
[1:41:40.080 --> 1:41:43.520]  let's walk through because you did predict it all I mean you really have
[1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:45.960]  you deserve the credit let's walk through what you think they're gonna do
[1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:52.760]  now where we're going what these deals Trump is is is making or doing what
[1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:56.240]  the Republican establishment's gonna try and what they're gonna do if they're
[1:41:56.240 --> 1:42:01.200]  able to remove Trump because I've got my CIA sources a lot of them and I've got
[1:42:01.200 --> 1:42:07.360]  FBI sources and things and they all think Trump's secure and that the left's
[1:42:07.360 --> 1:42:12.040]  been defeated for now but then I watched the movements and I watched people like
[1:42:12.040 --> 1:42:17.040]  Phil Mudd former deputy director of the CIA saying we're gonna kill Trump and
[1:42:17.040 --> 1:42:21.840]  and then and just my gut level I see the enemy moving big time what do you
[1:42:21.840 --> 1:42:28.920]  think well here's exactly what's going on they are going to impeach Trump because
[1:42:28.920 --> 1:42:32.880]  of something you have pointed out for years when nobody else would dare to
[1:42:32.880 --> 1:42:39.880]  talk about it you did remember under Obama Obama passed this was the beginning
[1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:44.400]  of the end of the coup when he passed the Patriot defense of Liberty and
[1:42:44.400 --> 1:42:53.280]  Abler Act I think it's 1-3-3-9-1 and what that says in times of civil you know
[1:42:53.280 --> 1:43:01.520]  disobedience or whatever the president can call on United Nations forces to come
[1:43:01.520 --> 1:43:08.120]  into this country folks that's a real executive order it's right there the
[1:43:08.120 --> 1:43:12.560]  mistake they made was making it where the president's the one that has to be
[1:43:12.560 --> 1:43:18.080]  the trigger because they figured Obama was president or next would be Hillary
[1:43:18.080 --> 1:43:23.560]  well it ended up being Trump that's why Alex you know normally when you see a
[1:43:23.560 --> 1:43:28.280]  president from another party the other party tries to shut down their agenda
[1:43:28.280 --> 1:43:32.200]  you'll notice with Trump they're not trying to shut his agenda down they
[1:43:32.200 --> 1:43:39.080]  won't him out and they're using Robert Mueller I've known him for 20 years 12
[1:43:39.080 --> 1:43:45.080]  of his 38 prosecutors I've worked with their professionals at Framing people
[1:43:45.080 --> 1:43:50.880]  they're going to get Trump through this grand jury on the one I'm told they're
[1:43:50.880 --> 1:43:57.400]  going to use is some morning perjury and then they're going to present it to the
[1:43:57.400 --> 1:44:02.840]  House of Representatives for an impeachment inquiry the Republicans are
[1:44:02.840 --> 1:44:08.720]  stabbing Trump in the back at every turn I don't doubt that he's meeting with
[1:44:08.720 --> 1:44:15.400]  the Democrats I mean he can't be betrayed anymore by anybody more than the
[1:44:15.400 --> 1:44:22.440]  Republicans if that impeachment goes to the House you can bet $100 to a biscuit
[1:44:22.440 --> 1:44:27.400]  if we don't stop it they will pass it on with an approval to go to the Senate
[1:44:27.400 --> 1:44:33.440]  trial then he's impeached when he's out they're okay see I don't necessarily
[1:44:33.440 --> 1:44:41.120]  trust my police I'm sorry my pants I don't I'm not saying he's a bad guy but
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:46.000]  he's been in the system way too long well pants from the beginning came in and
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:52.280]  basically kept himself walled off the president that's right you'll notice he
[1:44:52.280 --> 1:44:57.800]  has not been a stalwart backer of President Trump when Trump got in
[1:44:57.800 --> 1:45:03.360]  trouble you'll notice pants kind of backs away and you notice you notice now Rex
[1:45:03.360 --> 1:45:07.480]  Tillerson has actually bad mouthed him on Fox Cohen has done it they're all
[1:45:07.480 --> 1:45:14.960]  signaling they're ready to roll over yeah now here's the problem Alex you have
[1:45:14.960 --> 1:45:21.680]  shown video after video a few in vehicles already in this country folks
[1:45:21.680 --> 1:45:30.680]  thousands of these you know every kind of vehicle they sure let me just stop you
[1:45:30.680 --> 1:45:35.840]  I understand but beyond you in Soros has tried to cause a race war he was gonna do
[1:45:35.840 --> 1:45:40.080]  it after Charlottesville the hurricanes brought us together it seems like that
[1:45:40.080 --> 1:45:43.960]  narrative is falling apart but clearly they called for civil unrest civil
[1:45:43.960 --> 1:45:49.000]  emergency CNN MSNBC have called for the Civil War they've called for Trump's
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:55.240]  death but but but now what what detonator do they have well the detonator
[1:45:55.240 --> 1:46:01.680]  they've got is this the bad news about the hurricanes and everything's been
[1:46:01.680 --> 1:46:06.400]  going on you know the old trick Alex we talked about it for years when
[1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:09.840]  everybody's looking over here at the hurricanes guess what you're not paying
[1:46:09.840 --> 1:46:13.960]  attention to what they're doing behind the scenes that's right here is building
[1:46:13.960 --> 1:46:18.840]  a case he's using a grand jury everything is set up he's gonna say well
[1:46:18.840 --> 1:46:23.680]  it's not political because I've used an independent grand jury going crap and
[1:46:23.680 --> 1:46:27.880]  independent jury you got to be kidding me oh you got to love it it's a great
[1:46:27.880 --> 1:46:34.240]  to swamp jury directly out of the district of criminal swamp right so
[1:46:34.240 --> 1:46:39.880]  there's no doubt that what he finds he's going to bring through when he takes it
[1:46:39.880 --> 1:46:46.480]  to the house Alex this is where you come in I'm not strong enough we have got to
[1:46:46.480 --> 1:46:52.400]  have people ready when it goes to the house we've got to have a legion of
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:46:57.680]  people that physically go there and talk to him well that I've got to be on the
[1:46:57.680 --> 1:47:02.560]  phone the only phone no but I'm gonna stop you right there Larry Larry Larry
[1:47:02.560 --> 1:47:06.520]  Larry I'm gonna stop you the midterms are king not letting them impeach Trump
[1:47:06.520 --> 1:47:10.160]  is king they're trying to erode his support claiming he was gonna repeal the
[1:47:10.160 --> 1:47:13.640]  Dream Act without fixing it all lies they're clearly you're right their
[1:47:13.640 --> 1:47:16.800]  number one job is destroy him because he's a figure head of the Liberty
[1:47:16.800 --> 1:47:21.040]  Movement and people said they want to march on Washington for war how about
[1:47:21.040 --> 1:47:26.760]  if they try to impeach people fly to DC or fly to your congressman's district
[1:47:26.760 --> 1:47:32.320]  get a hold of his hand go to his speeches her speeches and physically in a
[1:47:32.320 --> 1:47:37.440]  loving way let them know don't be part of this because that's right you know
[1:47:37.440 --> 1:47:43.080]  Alex what people don't realize the Republican Party is weak they do not
[1:47:43.080 --> 1:47:47.600]  have a base do y'all hear me the Republican Party since Ronald Reagan
[1:47:47.600 --> 1:47:54.520]  Alex the Republican Party has only run one races because they were the lesser
[1:47:54.520 --> 1:48:00.880]  of two me that's right Trump has a base and that's why they're scared it's
[1:48:00.880 --> 1:48:05.720]  populism his populism America is replacing them it's killing the two
[1:48:05.720 --> 1:48:08.960]  parties so they're in an existential death battle and that's what I'm saying to
[1:48:08.960 --> 1:48:13.760]  you is you're absolutely right they have to make their move they're going to make
[1:48:13.760 --> 1:48:18.960]  their move and people have to understand to the new Republican freedom caucus who
[1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:22.760]  are good people but not sophisticated in some cases because they're busy for
[1:48:22.760 --> 1:48:26.960]  their constituents the globalist have said in their own white papers they're
[1:48:26.960 --> 1:48:31.600]  gonna end the two-party had the Republicans be a regional they're going
[1:48:31.600 --> 1:48:35.600]  to have new elections run by Homeland Security when Trump's removed if he is
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:39.680]  they're going to remove all of you so don't just think you're gonna score
[1:48:39.680 --> 1:48:44.480]  points with Trump's fall because you jump on board you lower that drawbridge
[1:48:44.480 --> 1:48:50.960]  you're the first brown shirt they're gonna hang high idiots so understand you
[1:48:50.960 --> 1:48:56.060]  sell out Trump no matter what he does at this point you sell Trump out you just
[1:48:56.060 --> 1:49:00.920]  sold your mama and your own ass down the river now Alex you on another
[1:49:00.920 --> 1:49:05.960]  prediction go ahead we stop them from impeaching Trump
[1:49:05.960 --> 1:49:11.400]  everybody better hold on they're killing troops gotta go
[1:49:11.400 --> 1:49:16.120]  two pants got to go and and I'm gonna skip this breaks we have more time why
[1:49:16.120 --> 1:49:21.040]  are they so hysterical about it well the economy is back on 3% growth rate
[1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:25.480]  again 4 trillion the stock market hundreds of billions of new jobs 1.6
[1:49:25.480 --> 1:49:30.360]  million new jobs crushing globalism he's not perfect but he doesn't want to
[1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:35.120]  screw America over he's not out to rape America he's a blue-collar billionaire
[1:49:35.120 --> 1:49:41.480]  what why do they hate him so much it's simple when you say President Trump you
[1:49:41.480 --> 1:49:47.120]  need to replace that with us he represents us they don't want us having
[1:49:47.120 --> 1:49:52.800]  anything to do with Washington DC they want the power there Trump is the
[1:49:52.800 --> 1:49:57.360]  symbol of the populist insurrection he is a symbol of the people and must be
[1:49:57.360 --> 1:50:04.680]  destroyed and they trump has said in his campaign and still I understand
[1:50:04.680 --> 1:50:09.320]  continues on that he's dedicated once he gets everything kind of under control
[1:50:09.320 --> 1:50:15.840]  to ship power back to the states he's already trying to do it he's with with
[1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:22.440]  with his Obamacare reform all of it right so they got to eliminate come on
[1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:27.960]  they've got to get rid of it now it's got to got to got to and we are the only
[1:50:27.960 --> 1:50:32.280]  ones that can stop them let me ask you this the media jumped on it and said I
[1:50:32.280 --> 1:50:35.720]  was throwing one of the bus he can talk to me I've talked to him a ten at night
[1:50:35.720 --> 1:50:39.880]  he's incredibly fluent and smart and much better speaker than I am I've talked
[1:50:39.880 --> 1:50:44.520]  to three people I'm not gonna say names here but New York Times writers other
[1:50:44.520 --> 1:50:48.200]  people like that that are that are respected in no Trump he is slurring his
[1:50:48.200 --> 1:50:52.280]  words now and it's not like he's tired what do you think's going on I'm
[1:50:52.280 --> 1:50:58.160]  worried they're slowly drugging you know Alex that's one of those things that I
[1:50:58.160 --> 1:51:03.680]  can't say because I don't know but they're going to it would not surprise me
[1:51:03.680 --> 1:51:08.920]  you know that it wouldn't surprise me they've got to slow him down if they've
[1:51:08.920 --> 1:51:14.280]  got a slippy Mickey's if they've got to do whatever they're gonna do it Trump
[1:51:14.280 --> 1:51:20.200]  has got to go remember this Alex if tomorrow everything kind of got back
[1:51:20.200 --> 1:51:27.400]  to normal is there any way you could ever again have any belief in the mainstream
[1:51:27.400 --> 1:51:35.160]  media no is there no all right so they have played all or nothing now they
[1:51:35.160 --> 1:51:40.160]  throw that all on the table either they win or it's over that's the key that's
[1:51:40.160 --> 1:51:43.480]  folks listen what he's saying this most important thing ever said here it's total
[1:51:43.480 --> 1:51:47.760]  war they're blown everyone hates them they know it they're cornered they're
[1:51:47.760 --> 1:51:51.880]  desperate it's total war people they're totally censoring everywhere they're
[1:51:51.880 --> 1:51:55.200]  threatening they're coming out for everybody because they're weak so let
[1:51:55.200 --> 1:52:00.480]  me ask you what do we do to win what do we do to save Trump can he be saved yes
[1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:05.760]  he can I've been trying on my side this is where you come in I'm not strong enough
[1:52:05.760 --> 1:52:17.480]  we have got to have an army ready an army ready that we put out that indictment
[1:52:17.480 --> 1:52:23.400]  against Trump presents it to the house remember Alex the house representative
[1:52:23.400 --> 1:52:31.280]  is controlled majority simple majority by Republicans 2018 is our last day on
[1:52:31.280 --> 1:52:37.440]  earth either we snap these creeps in line and make them start realizing they
[1:52:37.440 --> 1:52:43.080]  had better start waking working for us over sending them home with that
[1:52:43.080 --> 1:52:48.760]  indictment goes down we better have I've got a script written we better have
[1:52:48.760 --> 1:52:54.600]  people by the comasigans calling a handful don't let's call everyone a
[1:52:54.600 --> 1:52:59.800]  malice we've got to call a half a dozen Republican congressman and make sure
[1:52:59.800 --> 1:53:04.000]  they understand that you're going home and by the way well I think we should
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:08.120]  start doing it now as a dry run I totally agree and people should have
[1:53:08.120 --> 1:53:11.640]  airplanes up in the sky saying keep Trump and people should be letting
[1:53:11.640 --> 1:53:15.720]  businesses know Democrats want to bully us and say they won't let us do business
[1:53:15.720 --> 1:53:19.840]  anybody that's a Democrat at this point we should pull our money out of not
[1:53:19.840 --> 1:53:24.320]  support and stop talking to him because this is a total damn war total
[1:53:24.320 --> 1:53:30.440]  commitment and we've got to do it now we gotta do it now and guys remember this
[1:53:30.440 --> 1:53:36.280]  if tomorrow everything went back to normal could you ever again believe
[1:53:36.280 --> 1:53:43.360]  that to what we saw in 2016 in a fair primary election system after what you
[1:53:43.360 --> 1:53:47.240]  saw Hillary and let's walk through that what does that mean the Venezuelan model
[1:53:47.240 --> 1:53:51.560]  all their elite publications every elite globalist publication that doesn't
[1:53:51.560 --> 1:53:55.720]  communicate to the public communicates to the elites Atlantic monthly financial
[1:53:55.720 --> 1:54:00.400]  times of public affairs foreign affairs they've all said we're gonna have
[1:54:00.400 --> 1:54:03.920]  Homeland Security takeover elections all 50 attorney generals including
[1:54:03.920 --> 1:54:07.640]  Democrats have said no but but they're doing it we're gonna come in kick all
[1:54:07.640 --> 1:54:11.600]  the Republicans who were elected out and have new elections we'll never have
[1:54:11.600 --> 1:54:18.080]  real elections again we're gonna be like Venezuela absolutely and folks we are
[1:54:18.080 --> 1:54:24.120]  so close to becoming Venezuela it's ridiculous now I get all the time people
[1:54:24.120 --> 1:54:28.840]  say well what on earth are these people in Congress why would they support
[1:54:28.840 --> 1:54:33.680]  something that's going to cause the nation to fail remember what we talked
[1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:38.520]  about Alex the FEMA provisional government under a theme of provisional
[1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:44.440]  government Larry I've got I've got like ten clips of seeing in saying we want
[1:54:44.440 --> 1:54:49.440]  an emergency civil emergency and a provisional government they're actually
[1:54:49.440 --> 1:54:55.440]  saying it on TV they're saying it because they don't care anymore but what
[1:54:55.440 --> 1:55:00.400]  that means folks the one thing your congressman and senator fears more than
[1:55:00.400 --> 1:55:05.160]  anything on earth is losing that job because they know when this country
[1:55:05.160 --> 1:55:10.320]  collapses everybody that's a congressman and a senator becomes dukes and
[1:55:10.320 --> 1:55:15.960]  girls their families are fixed for life they become the ruling they will be the
[1:55:15.960 --> 1:55:21.000]  permanent ruling class just like a Latin American or Asian or or African
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:27.600]  country and everybody else in this country and if they fall out of that job
[1:55:27.600 --> 1:55:34.080]  they will be at the rest of us they will become peasants peasants now that's
[1:55:34.080 --> 1:55:40.720]  why they are weak in that one way Alex we can squeeze them we can make them know
[1:55:40.720 --> 1:55:46.560]  that Alex you know all these people going on the protest or hold on hold on
[1:55:46.560 --> 1:55:48.880]  we're gonna go to break come back and do five more minutes with us we gotta go
[1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:52.000]  to break but it's time to go to church for the congressman are even if you
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:54.760]  don't go to that church get them by the hand let them know you're watching them
[1:55:54.760 --> 1:55:58.840]  in a loving way they want to bully us and have their communists beat us up we
[1:55:58.840 --> 1:56:01.880]  should go get their hand we're in a nice suit and say Congress I know you're
[1:56:01.880 --> 1:56:04.960]  gonna do the right thing for your family and for mine and I'm willing to do
[1:56:04.960 --> 1:56:08.560]  whatever it takes for my family congressman you understand whatever it
[1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:13.840]  takes and just let them know that that's all I gotta say whatever it takes
[1:56:13.840 --> 1:56:22.840]  congressman thank you for your service to this country and that's it that's all
[1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:27.680]  you got to do and then commit to what you said and they'll feel that
[1:56:27.680 --> 1:56:33.880]  commitment to feel the commitment and our will will crush these people we go to
[1:56:33.880 --> 1:56:36.960]  break them back Larry but I'm telling you to feel the energy that's why I got
[1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:40.560]  sick when Trump won in a good way because I could feel this was just the

[2:03:45.920 --> 2:03:50.960]  power from him down to block it that's right sessions is completely surrounded

[2:04:46.960 --> 2:04:49.800]  already kicked their ass during the election
[2:04:49.800 --> 2:04:54.160]  Stanchia Anti-Federalist Patrick Kenry was opposed to the Constitution fearing
[2:04:54.160 --> 2:04:57.480]  it would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states
[2:04:57.480 --> 2:05:01.120]  that had created it but that it would become a tool to destroy individual
[2:05:01.120 --> 2:05:05.440]  liberty his warnings ignored have now come to pass he said you're not to
[2:05:05.440 --> 2:05:09.680]  inquire how your trade may be increased nor how you were to become a great and
[2:05:09.680 --> 2:05:14.080]  powerful people but how your liberties can be secured for liberty ought to be
[2:05:14.080 --> 2:05:17.920]  the direct end of your government Patrick Henry warned us the liberties of a
[2:05:17.920 --> 2:05:21.800]  people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their
[2:05:21.800 --> 2:05:26.320]  rulers may be concealed from them today everything the government does at every
[2:05:26.320 --> 2:05:30.880]  level is concealed from us we have trade deals to manage our economy that not
[2:05:30.880 --> 2:05:34.400]  even our elected representatives are allowed to see later in life Patrick
[2:05:34.400 --> 2:05:37.760]  Henry look back and said when the American spirit was in its youth the
[2:05:37.760 --> 2:05:42.120]  language of America was different liberty sir was the primary object today
[2:05:42.120 --> 2:05:47.440]  our primary concern is safety and comfort when we should be demanding liberty

[2:06:09.800 --> 2:06:14.320]  sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting killing and then

[2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:36.600]  how you expect Mueller to come out with the suborning perjury and other things
[2:09:36.600 --> 2:09:41.600]  and what we do with the Awan brothers and all the servers and the Russian
[2:09:41.600 --> 2:09:45.640]  connections and the Saudi Arabian connections and the Iranian connections
[2:09:45.640 --> 2:09:48.760]  and the Chinese connections are the biggest to the Clintons I mean what
[2:09:48.760 --> 2:09:53.800]  does Trump do to get on the offensive against these folks let me tell you the
[2:09:53.800 --> 2:09:59.400]  real simple answer to all this Trump needs to stand up take his stand realize
[2:09:59.400 --> 2:10:07.040]  that he's surrounded and suck it up get tough do what he does then you you
[2:10:07.040 --> 2:10:13.400]  Alex Jones and folks anybody that appears as me a patronizing Alex I live
[2:10:13.400 --> 2:10:17.400]  at 58 Kensington Drive Conway, Arkansas come here and I will knock the living
[2:10:17.400 --> 2:10:23.760]  piss out of you but I'm telling you Alex you've got the army that can save the
[2:10:23.760 --> 2:10:29.920]  country when you have your Navy Sea or XC alone you ask him the strategy to this
[2:10:29.920 --> 2:10:35.600]  is exporting the enemy's weaknesses they are weak the Republican Party is weak
[2:10:35.600 --> 2:10:44.240]  we can own that party we can own it and if your audience would engage engage you
[2:10:44.240 --> 2:10:48.440]  know Alex you broken the mold you've got an organization that can do it that's
[2:10:48.440 --> 2:10:52.320]  why they hate you so but you got to have support folks you got
[2:10:52.320 --> 2:10:56.320]  sure let's just be clear our audience is who they hate just like they hate
[2:10:56.320 --> 2:11:00.000]  Trump is a symbol of populism we're not that we're not that strong as her
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:04.280]  audience that is but yes if they start the impeachment we have to go to Congress
[2:11:04.280 --> 2:11:08.320]  in a nice way but physically talk to them we have to go to all their events
[2:11:08.320 --> 2:11:12.040]  now saying we know impeachments coming we know all this garbage and nullify the
[2:11:12.040 --> 2:11:17.480]  election we're not gonna put up with it we got a back Lou Dobbs Hannity the few
[2:11:17.480 --> 2:11:21.280]  people that are risking their jobs at Fox to tell the truth they're trying to get
[2:11:21.280 --> 2:11:24.360]  rid of limbo right now because he's not going along with impeachment we know
[2:11:24.360 --> 2:11:28.760]  because we're winning the Democrats are becoming a coastal elite party and that
[2:11:28.760 --> 2:11:32.400]  they're falling apart and the blue blood Republicans know that a populist
[2:11:32.400 --> 2:11:37.360]  nationalist movement led by all of us is taking them over that they're in an
[2:11:37.360 --> 2:11:43.440]  existential death battle to use Hillary's words against us so yes and when
[2:11:43.440 --> 2:11:48.280]  you expect Mueller with his swamp creature grand jury out of DC I mean a
[2:11:48.280 --> 2:11:52.600]  swamp jury we've heard of kangaroo courts and kangaroo juries and rigged
[2:11:52.600 --> 2:11:56.840]  juries we got a swamp jury grand jury that would indict a ham sandwich or
[2:11:56.840 --> 2:12:03.560]  Jesus Christ when do you expect that to come out it's got to be within five to
[2:12:03.560 --> 2:12:08.120]  six seven eight weeks that's when he's got to pull the trigger because remember
[2:12:08.120 --> 2:12:15.960]  in six months we're into the 18 election so they've got to get some of this mess
[2:12:15.960 --> 2:12:21.480]  in and started prior to the primary season and they want to cancel the last
[2:12:21.480 --> 2:12:25.960]  election have Homeland Security take over this one or the next to like
[2:12:25.960 --> 2:12:30.160]  Venezuela have a permanent fraudulent election system oh and all over the
[2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:35.880]  country Democrat cities there's like 14 towns in California seven in Maryland a
[2:12:35.880 --> 2:12:40.040]  bunch of others are letting illegal aliens vote I thought the illegals
[2:12:40.040 --> 2:12:43.200]  weren't voting even though we had all the top Democrats admitting they were and
[2:12:43.200 --> 2:12:49.080]  blocking voter ID I mean how obvious is that how obvious is it and by the way
[2:12:49.080 --> 2:12:53.280]  in the federal law anymore where did that go right I was on the program with
[2:12:53.280 --> 2:12:58.520]  Richard Mack share for tonight he said the most profound thing I've ever heard
[2:12:58.520 --> 2:13:04.600]  said he said the courts and law enforcement have become the very
[2:13:04.600 --> 2:13:12.200]  people that they're supposed to be actor to be prosecuted it's it's so turned
[2:13:12.200 --> 2:13:18.160]  around Alex is so upside down that they want us to think it's hopeless but it's
[2:13:18.160 --> 2:13:21.400]  not sure they're trying to break her will thank you Larry Nichols Larry Nichols
[2:13:21.400 --> 2:13:25.520]  dot news we'll talk to you next week thank you Larry he's absolutely right
[2:13:25.520 --> 2:13:30.000]  they make it like oh you hate Hispanics or you hate you can't go to Mexico or
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:33.200]  China and have a baby for free you can't come here with no documentation and say
[2:13:33.200 --> 2:13:36.880]  I've been here for 20 years I'm a dreamer you know you've been deported 14
[2:13:36.880 --> 2:13:42.160]  times for rape or whatever these are real cases and then yes 800 plus towns and
[2:13:42.160 --> 2:13:45.960]  cities illegals don't go to jail for drunk driving because they don't want to
[2:13:45.960 --> 2:13:51.240]  mess with them they're above the law now with no ID just whoever they want to say
[2:13:51.240 --> 2:13:56.440]  they are we put it on screen it's all over the country towns legalizing
[2:13:56.440 --> 2:14:02.480]  illegal aliens voting this is just the the level of the globalist overthrow
[2:14:02.480 --> 2:14:05.720]  they're just using these folks from desperate third-world countries that
[2:14:05.720 --> 2:14:10.760]  have been exploited by globalist as pawns I'm not even their enemies but I was
[2:14:10.760 --> 2:14:14.200]  reading during the election Democrats are having trouble getting illegals to go
[2:14:14.200 --> 2:14:17.520]  vote because they just want a job they don't want to be involved in fraud so
[2:14:17.520 --> 2:14:22.480]  they got to legalize it at least locally to make them feel like really it's okay
[2:14:22.480 --> 2:14:26.880]  because they're because they're having trouble getting the Hispanic farmer type
[2:14:26.880 --> 2:14:30.120]  immigrants to go engage in criminal activity and I'm not trying to lionize
[2:14:30.120 --> 2:14:33.840]  them it's just a fact and you got Democrats on tape admitting it and then
[2:14:33.840 --> 2:14:39.040]  they go on the news and say we made it up now Craig Sawyer great guy great
[2:14:39.040 --> 2:14:43.440]  patriot hosted tons of TV shows documentaries you'll host of a whole
[2:14:43.440 --> 2:14:47.600]  bunch of TV programs top shot you name it but the big thing he's involved in
[2:14:47.600 --> 2:14:50.960]  highly recommended by one of the guys that I work with who are great patriots
[2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:55.040]  and great sources came to town earlier this year got to know him good I'm
[2:14:55.040 --> 2:14:58.840]  trying behind the scenes to help him with this whole documentary investigation
[2:14:58.840 --> 2:15:02.560]  because the cops bust the pedophiles as you see daily mayor stepping down people
[2:15:02.560 --> 2:15:07.200]  getting arrested tens of thousands arrested but then it deputy Pope steps
[2:15:07.200 --> 2:15:12.160]  down procuring hundreds of children reportedly but then there's no one there
[2:15:12.160 --> 2:15:18.480]  ever to cover it notice you see articles of 150 on 290 or 600 pedophiles
[2:15:18.480 --> 2:15:23.240]  arrested with kids in cages not just child porn and then it's never in the
[2:15:23.240 --> 2:15:28.680]  news again you pull up that KTLA headline that was women and children in
[2:15:28.680 --> 2:15:34.960]  cages some children as young as five years old as sex slaves in cages that
[2:15:34.960 --> 2:15:39.280]  people came and picked out was in the news once so it got out then it gets
[2:15:39.280 --> 2:15:43.600]  shut down you ask why Trump can't run anything they're blocking us at every
[2:15:43.600 --> 2:15:48.440]  level but we're still fighting back tactical insider comm vets for child
[2:15:48.440 --> 2:15:53.440]  rescue.org is a former Marine veteran former Navy SEAL sniper and combat
[2:15:53.440 --> 2:15:56.320]  instructor Sawyer is the owner of tactical insider which brings technical
[2:15:56.320 --> 2:15:59.560]  advice on weapons and combat to Hollywood films and actors Sawyer began his
[2:15:59.560 --> 2:16:02.680]  military career with the US Marine Corps and switched to the US Navy to pursue
[2:16:02.680 --> 2:16:06.440]  career special operations Sawyer has run specialized teams provide security for
[2:16:06.440 --> 2:16:09.840]  politicians dignitaries including Hillary Clinton McCain Rumsfeld and
[2:16:09.840 --> 2:16:13.400]  Negra Ponte tactical insider and it goes all through the work he's done in
[2:16:13.400 --> 2:16:17.520]  deadliest missions and top shot and the rest of it so we're going to break it
[2:16:17.520 --> 2:16:21.360]  about four minutes but all this happening here's the Washington Post
[2:16:21.360 --> 2:16:27.160]  Bill and Hillary Clinton went to voodoo ceremony here's another one Satanic
[2:16:27.160 --> 2:16:32.280]  Temple is advocating Planned Parenthood fights Missouri abortion laws admitted
[2:16:32.280 --> 2:16:36.320]  cultist Sally Quinn who now says she killed people in rituals that's the
[2:16:36.320 --> 2:16:42.280]  Washington Post president's wife criticized Sarah Palin gatekeeper of DC
[2:16:42.280 --> 2:16:47.320]  society comes out as an occultist says she killed people Planned Parenthood
[2:16:47.320 --> 2:16:51.160]  teams up with Satanist to promote abortion this is just today's news
[2:16:51.160 --> 2:16:57.240]  Hillary Clinton comes out and says she practices voodoo what in the world Craig
[2:16:57.240 --> 2:17:00.560]  Sawyer because I know you've got your sources all over you can't get into it
[2:17:00.560 --> 2:17:04.080]  on air you've been a federal marshal as well you know air marshal not just Navy
[2:17:04.080 --> 2:17:07.800]  Seal everybody I talked to in law enforcement knows this but it always
[2:17:07.800 --> 2:17:11.960]  gets killed when you're investigating it but we're talking about abortionist
[2:17:11.960 --> 2:17:15.400]  admitting that they keep babies alive that are partial birth abortions and
[2:17:15.400 --> 2:17:21.760]  rape them drink their blood this is coming out in the news yeah it's these
[2:17:21.760 --> 2:17:27.880]  are weird times Alex we we've got to drain that swamp and I I empathize with
[2:17:27.880 --> 2:17:32.880]  President Trump he's he's got to find a way to kind of clear himself some elbow
[2:17:32.880 --> 2:17:38.040]  room to get in there and and make any positive impact in order for him to get
[2:17:38.040 --> 2:17:41.320]  legislation through and and and get anything done he's got to get those
[2:17:41.320 --> 2:17:45.680]  fleas off of his back he needs a strong AG he needs sessions to be in their
[2:17:45.680 --> 2:17:50.360]  cracking heads of perp walk and big name crooks every day if Jeff Sessions is
[2:17:50.360 --> 2:17:55.160]  not allowed to do that because of people in his way then he and the president
[2:17:55.160 --> 2:17:59.120]  need to assert themselves to the but they're belligerently in mutiny I mean
[2:17:59.120 --> 2:18:02.680]  what do you do if my crew of 70 people just said they weren't going to show up
[2:18:02.680 --> 2:18:06.520]  what do I do I mean it's it's the cowardice of these people are all
[2:18:06.520 --> 2:18:10.040]  intimidated it's not even they're being offered stuff I've learned they're all
[2:18:10.040 --> 2:18:15.840]  just cowards well you know he needs the Donald Trump's famous for saying you're
[2:18:15.840 --> 2:18:20.040]  fired and I think that's what's needed in DC more than anything else look if your
[2:18:20.040 --> 2:18:23.520]  staff are hostile to you you're better off without him I think he's better off
[2:18:23.520 --> 2:18:27.400]  just kind of drain in the swamp to whatever degree he can around him and
[2:18:27.400 --> 2:18:32.080]  and be on an active hiring campaign of a finding decent quality people who will
[2:18:32.080 --> 2:18:36.800]  just act in good faith and so he can get moving you know crawl walk run right
[2:18:36.800 --> 2:18:40.800]  now he can't swing a dead cat by the tail without hitting 10 people that would
[2:18:40.800 --> 2:18:43.360]  stab him in the back exactly let me ask you just want to break when I come back
[2:18:43.360 --> 2:18:46.200]  into whatever you want to cover correct Sawyer but what do you make of all the
[2:18:46.200 --> 2:18:50.520]  devil worship is coming on it's almost like they're being exposed so suddenly
[2:18:50.520 --> 2:18:54.120]  they're like yeah pedophilia is okay yeah devil worships okay they're trying to
[2:18:54.120 --> 2:18:58.880]  normalize it well I think what we're seeing now Alex is a little bit of a
[2:18:58.880 --> 2:19:03.160]  peek behind the curtain the little old man that's back there pulling all the
[2:19:03.160 --> 2:19:08.480]  levers it's been so desperate to keep it secret figuratively speaking is as
[2:19:08.480 --> 2:19:11.880]  being revealed slowly to the American public so I think we're seeing that
[2:19:11.880 --> 2:19:16.280]  there is actually a fight between good and evil if you will for control over
[2:19:16.280 --> 2:19:21.160]  the United States and it really all boils down from that fact that's right
[2:19:21.160 --> 2:19:25.240]  the older I get the more I learn it's just good and evil isn't it well it's
[2:19:25.240 --> 2:19:30.520]  mankind's tendency that to struggle for more and more power and abuse abuse that
[2:19:30.520 --> 2:19:34.360]  power when he has too much of it look at any of the big government models
[2:19:34.360 --> 2:19:38.080]  throughout history they inevitably turn hostile and that's where you see
[2:19:38.080 --> 2:19:41.520]  government spots or come back I want you to preach it when you come back I'm
[2:19:41.520 --> 2:19:44.600]  gonna give you the forum and come back as I want to ask that question why good
[2:19:44.600 --> 2:19:48.680]  guys don't want power so so is that a defect we have because then we let the

[2:24:24.120 --> 2:24:30.700]  now it's already clear in our emails and Hillary's but now we have a hundred
[2:24:30.700 --> 2:24:35.600]  percent clear with quotes from these where they say give us this money and
[2:24:35.600 --> 2:24:41.920]  Hillary will do this this is now open and shut if sessions doesn't act on this
[2:24:41.920 --> 2:24:46.200]  and Trump doesn't act on this it's their fault there's no excuse this is
[2:24:46.200 --> 2:24:51.560]  massive and Congress should act on this that's why Mueller and all them are so
[2:24:51.560 --> 2:24:56.920]  desperate because they're up to their eyeballs covering all this up they are
[2:24:56.920 --> 2:25:02.240]  the ones that are complicit that's why they want Trump out because they thought
[2:25:02.240 --> 2:25:05.200]  they were gonna be in forever and committed all these incredible crimes

[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:23.960]  not the best interest of the American people so that's you know it's obvious
[2:25:23.960 --> 2:25:27.480]  that Trump's a fly in the ointment for the globalist and the power mongers that
[2:25:27.480 --> 2:25:32.440]  want control over the American people so they're attacking him at will they
[2:25:32.440 --> 2:25:37.120]  can't leave him alone because he's a big threat to what they're doing
[2:25:37.720 --> 2:25:41.800]  break down your latest research Craig because I'm not gonna ask a lot of
[2:25:41.800 --> 2:25:46.080]  questions but looking into all the child kidnapping the pedophilia more and more
[2:25:46.080 --> 2:25:51.000]  of it's coming out where your investigations well we're shooting a

[2:25:59.160 --> 2:26:02.800]  happening a lot of the American public do not even know or believe that there
[2:26:02.800 --> 2:26:07.840]  is a problem with with pedophilia or child trafficking so what we're doing is
[2:26:07.840 --> 2:26:12.600]  we're we're shooting and interviewing all kinds of people that are involved in
[2:26:12.600 --> 2:26:18.120]  this from federal law enforcement local law enforcement perps even those still

[2:26:28.040 --> 2:26:33.040]  trial in a way the facts so that it's irrefutable so that the American
[2:26:33.040 --> 2:26:38.360]  public can see and recognize what is happening and then from there once they
[2:26:38.360 --> 2:26:43.480]  they accept the truth and recognize that this is a problem and that it is
[2:26:43.480 --> 2:26:48.280]  happening we can begin walking through further and further detail and showing
[2:26:48.280 --> 2:26:52.320]  them all of the different ways that it's happening so what we're finding out is
[2:26:52.320 --> 2:27:00.520]  that children have become sickly enough the the new form of revenue it's a new
[2:27:00.520 --> 2:27:06.160]  currency for the sick and some people want them for their organs Alex some
[2:27:06.160 --> 2:27:11.680]  people want them for sexual perversion purposes and some people want them for
[2:27:11.680 --> 2:27:17.400]  satanic or Luciferian rituals where they in some cases they actually torture the
[2:27:17.400 --> 2:27:22.480]  children to death and ceremonies which is very strange very bizarre and very
[2:27:22.480 --> 2:27:27.760]  difficult for the American average American person to accept and face so
[2:27:27.760 --> 2:27:33.080]  one of the biggest challenges we face Alex is in really finding a way to tell
[2:27:33.080 --> 2:27:36.880]  it to the American citizen where they won't fold up and close their eyes and
[2:27:36.880 --> 2:27:42.400]  and cover their ears because they can't bear the thought of it they can't bear
[2:27:42.400 --> 2:27:46.800]  the thought of the reality because it is that dark and ugly so we've got a sugar
[2:27:46.800 --> 2:27:51.640]  coated to some degree just so that we can get people to pay attention but you
[2:27:51.640 --> 2:27:56.000]  know but Craig let me just say this it's that blind spot because I don't meet
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:58.640]  with you privately and talking to other torches I haven't and what things that
[2:27:58.640 --> 2:28:02.040]  literally I confirmed I don't want to look at this I don't want to admit it
[2:28:02.040 --> 2:28:05.800]  you start gulping you know when we're talking in private like not able to
[2:28:05.800 --> 2:28:09.640]  breathe when you think about the things you've been shown and seen you know what
[2:28:09.640 --> 2:28:15.640]  just show everybody people need to see this I understand we need to have some
[2:28:15.640 --> 2:28:19.480]  sugarcoating but I think once they get into it they need to just see how
[2:28:19.480 --> 2:28:22.480]  horrible it is and understand just because you don't want to torture a
[2:28:22.480 --> 2:28:26.080]  two-year-old to death while they beg for mommy doesn't mean other people don't
[2:28:26.080 --> 2:28:32.520]  and they do well I don't let me clarify I don't mean to pull punches so that
[2:28:32.520 --> 2:28:36.720]  people don't aren't told or shown what's happening but there's a delivery
[2:28:36.720 --> 2:28:40.880]  method psychologically there'll be a lot of people that we've had access to that
[2:28:40.880 --> 2:28:44.720]  a bit a lot of study on the public and what the public public can tolerate what
[2:28:44.720 --> 2:28:50.960]  they cannot so let's just as one example the average American citizen cannot
[2:28:50.960 --> 2:28:54.760]  face the fact that there's evil or that there are predators out there after
[2:28:54.760 --> 2:28:59.040]  their kids but so they will tune off they will tune out they will click away if
[2:28:59.040 --> 2:29:04.400]  you ask them to face that and to help in that regard but it's just as simply as
[2:29:04.400 --> 2:29:10.280]  saying well let's create a safe space for our kids then they'll then they're
[2:29:10.280 --> 2:29:13.120]  still with you they'll still help and they'll still contribute and then still
[2:29:13.120 --> 2:29:16.840]  donate and still and still support you but no I get it let's talk about we
[2:29:16.840 --> 2:29:19.920]  come back to the tail hold on because you're you're you're finally talking
[2:29:19.920 --> 2:29:25.080]  about stuff it's hard to talk about it exactly there's a fight or flight and we
[2:29:25.080 --> 2:29:30.760]  want people to fight not run so how do we do that we'll be back

[2:32:56.760 --> 2:33:02.440]  happened to your 33,000 emails what happened in Benghazi read the book you
[2:33:02.440 --> 2:33:06.120]  have millions of dollars that was supposed to go to the people in Haiti you
[2:33:06.120 --> 2:33:11.600]  know what I'm so sorry you believe things that are untrue rich what happened
[2:33:11.600 --> 2:33:17.520]  to your health you know it's so great to see you I have a question for you what
[2:33:17.520 --> 2:33:47.440]  are you going to divorce your husband for toxic I'm running
[2:33:47.440 --> 2:33:51.120]  for president every day Americans need a champion and I want to be that
[2:33:51.120 --> 2:34:10.800]  champion I don't feel no ways tired it has been recorded you've made five
[2:34:10.800 --> 2:34:15.200]  million making speeches the president's made more than a hundred million
[2:34:15.200 --> 2:34:19.600]  dollars what's difference at this point doesn't make what does that make Hillary
[2:34:19.600 --> 2:34:24.480]  Clinton to the bush family my sister in law
[2:34:31.320 --> 2:34:36.520]  another conspiracy theory have you always told the truth I've always tried to
[2:34:36.520 --> 2:34:43.120]  always always I will fight to reign in Wall Street and you know what I know how
[2:34:43.120 --> 2:34:48.240]  to do it we came out of the White House not only dead broke but in debt I
[2:34:48.240 --> 2:34:52.520]  remember landing under sniper fire it was supposed to be some kind of a
[2:34:52.520 --> 2:34:56.200]  greeting ceremony at the airport but instead we just ran with our heads down
[2:34:56.200 --> 2:35:26.120]  to get into the vehicles it's also what happens when you listen to the radio
[2:35:26.120 --> 2:35:32.120]  host Alex Jones who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were
[2:35:32.120 --> 2:35:37.400]  inside jobs he even said the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child
[2:35:37.400 --> 2:35:47.000]  actors live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:56.560]  Jones the only reason we're playing these older intros when she was still running is because she's back with her book back
[2:35:56.560 --> 2:36:00.680]  attacking back lying about what I said about 9-11 or back about what I said
[2:36:00.680 --> 2:36:04.520]  about Sandy Hook or any of this they just misrepresent but Craig Sawyer is a
[2:36:04.520 --> 2:36:09.080]  great guy on air but also off air but he's hard to talk about stuff because I
[2:36:09.080 --> 2:36:13.440]  know he doesn't want the bad guys to get away but here's the deal you've got 16
[2:36:13.440 --> 2:36:18.240]  mayors arrested or stepped down in just the last eight months for raping
[2:36:18.240 --> 2:36:21.480]  children or admitting they raped children or to cover up that you got
[2:36:21.480 --> 2:36:26.600]  Hastard you've got you've got Wiener you've got Epstein it's there's
[2:36:26.600 --> 2:36:31.960]  thousands of cases and so it's unraveling so recap for a lot of folks
[2:36:31.960 --> 2:36:37.680]  you just listen like 15-20 minutes Craig so recap the film you're making the
[2:36:37.680 --> 2:36:41.320]  organization you've got vets for children rescue what you're doing the
[2:36:41.320 --> 2:36:45.640]  investigation the law enforcement sources and what you're discovering what
[2:36:45.640 --> 2:36:51.080]  you're finding and the real nature of this rabbit hole and how deep it goes
[2:36:51.080 --> 2:36:56.680]  because you got you got cut off by that heartbreak okay well I founded vets for
[2:36:56.680 --> 2:37:02.600]  child rescue a an organization to educate the American public on the fact
[2:37:02.600 --> 2:37:06.600]  that we have a serious child trafficking problem here in the Continental
[2:37:06.600 --> 2:37:11.360]  United States so we decided the best weapon if you will the big nuclear
[2:37:11.360 --> 2:37:16.600]  weapon would be to compromise the opposition's entire operation that you
[2:37:16.600 --> 2:37:21.120]  look this there's a war on against our children and not just again on our minds
[2:37:21.120 --> 2:37:26.240]  with the the deception through the so-called mainstream media but also
[2:37:26.240 --> 2:37:31.480]  against our future generations with the pedophilia and it's it's much larger
[2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:36.080]  than I would have ever believed until I got into it so I thought okay well
[2:37:36.080 --> 2:37:39.160]  kinetic operations are never going to win this you can't win this by door
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:45.160]  kicking because this is at an estimated 27 million victims you can't kick that
[2:37:45.160 --> 2:37:49.520]  many doors so look and there are children are disappearing off the
[2:37:49.520 --> 2:37:54.880]  streets daily by the thousands and so we've got to really blow the lid off
[2:37:54.880 --> 2:37:59.200]  this so compromising the entire operation just educating the American
[2:37:59.200 --> 2:38:04.080]  public on the fact that this is going on what it looks like because for my
[2:38:04.080 --> 2:38:08.240]  other sources that I can't even get into obviously this is very command and
[2:38:08.240 --> 2:38:13.920]  control big banks big events this is organized yeah yeah it is and you'll
[2:38:13.920 --> 2:38:18.000]  never find all the children but what we can do is make it almost impossible for
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:22.640]  them to continue this in the future and gain more so we want to expose it and
[2:38:22.640 --> 2:38:26.720]  so we're interviewing all kinds of people and finding that that yep there
[2:38:26.720 --> 2:38:31.160]  are judges there are chiefs of police in certain places that are corrupt and
[2:38:31.160 --> 2:38:34.760]  that are part of the problem they're they're complicit so that makes it very
[2:38:34.760 --> 2:38:39.840]  difficult a lot of people are notifying different centers who are supposed to be
[2:38:39.840 --> 2:38:45.320]  helping with the child trafficking or helping report it and stop it and they're
[2:38:45.320 --> 2:38:48.600]  actually blocking the people that I was about to say I got a briefing about a
[2:38:48.600 --> 2:38:53.360]  year ago another one about six months ago from high-level person involved with a
[2:38:53.360 --> 2:38:57.320]  major task force and he said exactly what you said he drew it out for me how
[2:38:57.320 --> 2:39:01.280]  it ends at the top and even though a police chief may not be raping the kids
[2:39:01.280 --> 2:39:04.600]  they're just told by the politicos you need to drop this and leave this alone
[2:39:04.600 --> 2:39:10.800]  yeah yeah I met a former mayor up near Chicago who a friend of hers was actually
[2:39:10.800 --> 2:39:16.520]  imprisoned by a chief of police who was corrupt and that woman would have
[2:39:16.520 --> 2:39:21.400]  remained in prison for the rest of her life for having reported child trafficking
[2:39:21.400 --> 2:39:26.400]  as what she was supposed to do as a citizen that was her responsibility and
[2:39:26.400 --> 2:39:34.080]  duty but except for the the firing of that that that chief of police and she
[2:39:34.080 --> 2:39:37.920]  would have been she would have been in prison the rest of her life so I got to
[2:39:37.920 --> 2:39:43.200]  meet her not long ago so yeah there you know the problem there is no Alex no
[2:39:43.200 --> 2:39:46.680]  segment of our society that it's completely free from this we're finding
[2:39:46.680 --> 2:39:53.560]  that people in positions of authority I don't care if it's ghouls churches
[2:39:53.560 --> 2:39:59.240]  government even CPS a lot of these unfortunately the predators find their
[2:39:59.240 --> 2:40:03.000]  way into these organizations because it's very easy for them to target the
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:09.920]  children from the officers yeah it's a cult of power we really have to as as
[2:40:09.920 --> 2:40:14.840]  parents and citizens safeguard our children and provide great scrutiny
[2:40:14.840 --> 2:40:19.520]  upon these organizations no matter what their title to ensure that our kids are
[2:40:19.520 --> 2:40:23.240]  okay that they are in fact let's expand on your investigation we're not
[2:40:23.240 --> 2:40:26.480]  getting in too much of it the film what you're discovering who you're you're
[2:40:26.480 --> 2:40:30.480]  saying you know from start to finish from the perpetrators that the other in
[2:40:30.480 --> 2:40:34.240]  field procures that we know we're always dragging it's the only bustle of the
[2:40:34.240 --> 2:40:38.160]  guys dragging them back to Dracula's castle to use that archetype let's talk
[2:40:38.160 --> 2:40:43.600]  more about the film well we're we're painting not not to give it away but
[2:40:43.600 --> 2:40:47.960]  we're learning it it's just like narcotics as far as a business goes Alex and
[2:40:47.960 --> 2:40:52.240]  I don't want to make it sound I don't want to condone it make it sound like
[2:40:52.240 --> 2:40:55.360]  it's a legitimate business it's evil but what they're doing is they've turned
[2:40:55.360 --> 2:41:00.640]  children into the next currency so those who who peddle narcotics petal
[2:41:00.640 --> 2:41:04.960]  weapons and other things they're they're now peddling children they're
[2:41:04.960 --> 2:41:09.480]  trafficking children for for big money to the global elite who have a penchant
[2:41:09.480 --> 2:41:15.680]  for raping and torturing these children or taking their organs for for
[2:41:15.680 --> 2:41:19.600]  surgeries that they may need and so forth so it's very ugly but there's a lot
[2:41:19.600 --> 2:41:24.480]  of money being made moving children around and selling them to the those who
[2:41:24.480 --> 2:41:28.720]  have the demand so there's even there's even online stuff where someone can
[2:41:28.720 --> 2:41:32.800]  swipe credit card here in the States and someone in another company country let's
[2:41:32.800 --> 2:41:37.840]  say the Philippines will actually harm a child and rape a child or do the
[2:41:37.840 --> 2:41:42.080]  unthinkable and very much before me I'm yeah yeah live streaming they'll do it
[2:41:42.080 --> 2:41:45.440]  live streaming yeah that's the big thing now with snuff films is live and on
[2:41:45.440 --> 2:41:50.080]  demand yeah this has got to stop man this is bad this is not okay let me raise
[2:41:50.080 --> 2:41:54.480]  this exposure and spotlights the way to go and I'm not a visual anti-god I'm not
[2:41:54.480 --> 2:41:58.320]  gonna shoot my mouth up being you know tough for anything but at the end of
[2:41:58.320 --> 2:42:02.720]  the day people have to make their own decisions when they find it locally we
[2:42:02.720 --> 2:42:06.320]  already see a lot of cops busting people regardless of what their officials and
[2:42:06.320 --> 2:42:10.480]  their bosses tell them so there's a major move organically against this and the
[2:42:10.480 --> 2:42:14.600]  word I'm hearing just through the ether is that people are gonna start taking
[2:42:14.600 --> 2:42:18.920]  little swims they're gonna start falling downstairs that this doesn't get
[2:42:18.920 --> 2:42:23.760]  handled on the top it's gonna get handled well yeah I think people are
[2:42:23.760 --> 2:42:28.280]  getting fed up there they're they're losing faith in the Department of
[2:42:28.280 --> 2:42:32.760]  Justice to crack down on the big name perps who are driving the big money at
[2:42:32.760 --> 2:42:38.280]  the top of Washington DC and other places I think man again exactly that's
[2:42:38.280 --> 2:42:43.280]  what I'm told all my sources that's what I'm told Craig I'm just backing you up
[2:42:43.280 --> 2:42:46.840]  here you can clean it up all day at the bottom but it always reconstitutes
[2:42:46.840 --> 2:42:51.560]  because you never get the kingpins I mean exactly it's got to be a top-down
[2:42:51.560 --> 2:42:56.200]  thing I think I think there is nothing really more important than than
[2:42:56.200 --> 2:43:00.760]  military national security itself than this and because so many of our
[2:43:00.760 --> 2:43:05.160]  politicians are blackmailed and compromised due to this child trafficking
[2:43:05.160 --> 2:43:10.680]  and pedophilia scourge so it's tied it's it's got its tentacles tied all around
[2:43:10.680 --> 2:43:17.520]  the politicians it's key we have to we have to clean that it's like I use the
[2:43:17.520 --> 2:43:21.120]  analogy of renovating a house that's been eaten up by termites I mean you got
[2:43:21.120 --> 2:43:27.200]  to tear the thing halfway apart if it's bad to restore it and rebuild it with
[2:43:27.200 --> 2:43:32.280]  sound materials so that it's it's a worthy shelter as intended originally so
[2:43:32.280 --> 2:43:36.520]  I think Washington DC has been so infested with with parasites that we
[2:43:36.520 --> 2:43:41.680]  really have to focus on cracking some heads perc walk and a lot of big-name
[2:43:41.680 --> 2:43:46.160]  crooks before anything else can heal the American public have been starved
[2:43:46.160 --> 2:43:52.000]  Alex for justice we're seeing these these scumbags parading back and forth
[2:43:52.000 --> 2:43:56.120]  because they know they're untouchable that's on that's unacceptable it's
[2:43:56.120 --> 2:44:00.040]  unthinkable they have to go down they have to be put on trial the American
[2:44:00.040 --> 2:44:03.040]  public I agree how do you control your desire because I've talked a lot of
[2:44:03.040 --> 2:44:05.640]  people that have been in the investigations when they know somebody's
[2:44:05.640 --> 2:44:10.040]  ripening killing kids shelling kids kidnapping them and as a man as a father
[2:44:10.040 --> 2:44:13.920]  you want to kill them but then in the system you can't you see him go free I
[2:44:13.920 --> 2:44:17.880]  don't know just even covering this I just can't help it as a father these
[2:44:17.880 --> 2:44:22.720]  feelings I have well I think I think the truth is the most powerful weapon that
[2:44:22.720 --> 2:44:26.640]  there is Alex my father's a pastor always told me they said son be careful how
[2:44:26.640 --> 2:44:30.080]  you wield the truth it is the most powerful weapon you'll ever have your
[2:44:30.080 --> 2:44:34.480]  hands on and so I believe that if we can start start showing the American
[2:44:34.480 --> 2:44:40.480]  public what like who Hillary Clinton really is who Barack Hussein Obama really
[2:44:40.480 --> 2:44:45.720]  is and who George Soros really is and all those that are like them if we could
[2:44:45.720 --> 2:44:49.160]  peel away that facade and give the American public a peek behind the curtain
[2:44:49.160 --> 2:44:54.440]  those people will have no more power because the American citizens who give
[2:44:54.440 --> 2:44:58.720]  the wealth to those those elites come bags would turn on them and have nothing
[2:44:58.720 --> 2:45:02.480]  to do with them because they would be so repugnant and unacceptable to us they
[2:45:02.480 --> 2:45:07.160]  could no longer make billions off out of our pockets we control the purse
[2:45:07.160 --> 2:45:12.040]  strings we need to do that and before the American public to can be completely
[2:45:12.040 --> 2:45:16.680]  awoken to it they have to be exposed and educated on the fact that it's true so
[2:45:16.680 --> 2:45:21.360]  that's what we're about this is a big strategic fix act Alex this is not a
[2:45:21.360 --> 2:45:26.000]  little tactical you know go into one room with a pistol and save one one kid
[2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:31.320]  we got 27 million victims this has to be a cultural awakening a cultural change
[2:45:31.320 --> 2:45:35.760]  in order to make a prompt more promising tomorrow for the future kids that
[2:45:35.760 --> 2:45:39.440]  would have been rolled out because we've got to change the entire face of this
[2:45:39.440 --> 2:45:43.320]  battle because for the occultists the devil worshipers the control freaks the
[2:45:43.320 --> 2:45:46.880]  pedophiles and then people that want to make money off of them and blackmail them
[2:45:46.880 --> 2:45:51.240]  as you said there's a big picture here that you just illustrated beautifully we
[2:45:51.240 --> 2:45:55.400]  have to have a culture that admits it's happening and watches out for it and
[2:45:55.400 --> 2:45:59.600]  resist it and steps up against it and says no but when you're talking you know
[2:45:59.600 --> 2:46:03.320]  in the group you've got involved at vetsforchildrescue.org they're an MI6
[2:46:03.320 --> 2:46:08.800]  MI5 German intelligence FBI CIA Army Navy Marine Corps seals you name it when
[2:46:08.800 --> 2:46:11.840]  they're just in their regular duties running into this or in surveillance
[2:46:11.840 --> 2:46:15.960]  stuff coming into it as you said it's industrial it's ubiquitous it's a it's
[2:46:15.960 --> 2:46:20.720]  a fifth column of corruption in the country not just theft or drugs or you
[2:46:20.720 --> 2:46:24.200]  know all this other stuff or extortion but but you've got this this underbelly
[2:46:24.200 --> 2:46:29.440]  that really is the heart of this whole war on our children just like the Bible
[2:46:29.440 --> 2:46:34.880]  says you know Satan's going after the kids how does it affect people combat
[2:46:34.880 --> 2:46:40.440]  vets you name it who have to sit there and have to investigate this I mean
[2:46:40.440 --> 2:46:45.000]  because I'm told it's very traumatizing to the people that do go in do save the
[2:46:45.000 --> 2:46:49.040]  kids do see the films do dig up the little bodies and then see it all
[2:46:49.040 --> 2:46:53.760]  basically covered up it's traumatic Alex there's no there's no easy way to put
[2:46:53.760 --> 2:47:02.040]  it painful but look the kids are enduring it so if they are suffering this
[2:47:02.040 --> 2:47:08.280]  can we not at least pay attention enough to help fix it as as citizens can we not
[2:47:08.280 --> 2:47:11.680]  at least that's the point you know it as bad as this is to cover and focus on
[2:47:11.680 --> 2:47:17.520]  this is not fun what about them right right so look man shame on us we can at
[2:47:17.520 --> 2:47:21.600]  least do that why are we on this planet if we can't do anything positive and
[2:47:21.600 --> 2:47:26.120]  anything good with our lives we may as well not be here individually so as a
[2:47:26.120 --> 2:47:31.000]  leader the president Trump can set forth an agenda that to turn this around and
[2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:35.240]  make it a priority there there can be asked he said execute pedophiles and
[2:47:35.240 --> 2:47:39.040]  he's trying he's trying from your research for all these sources Trump I
[2:47:39.040 --> 2:47:42.720]  know just emotionally said we're supporting it we've seen more bust the
[2:47:42.720 --> 2:47:46.560]  last eight months we saw the last five years that's mainstream news pedophiles
[2:47:46.560 --> 2:47:49.920]  are getting exposed everywhere because people are just calling it out the you
[2:47:49.920 --> 2:47:53.600]  know the deputy pope step down it's just it's everywhere so we know we're on the
[2:47:53.600 --> 2:47:57.000]  march but it's not even command and control it's don't wait for orders from
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:00.080]  headquarters go to the sound of the guns as you know some I forget who said
[2:48:00.080 --> 2:48:05.120]  that the Revolutionary War back in 1777 but but but we're there but talking to
[2:48:05.120 --> 2:48:09.440]  your sources you know where is it going because there's nobody directing it we're
[2:48:09.440 --> 2:48:13.840]  just all doing it but I mean it's getting big right now well that's why I
[2:48:13.840 --> 2:48:19.400]  go back to President Trump Alex I do give him credit for for taking steps to
[2:48:19.400 --> 2:48:24.800]  fix this but I talked to General Mad Dog Mattis at Stanford University's graduate
[2:48:24.800 --> 2:48:28.640]  school of business a couple years ago and he talked about leadership and
[2:48:28.640 --> 2:48:33.400]  setting the culture what the president can do that the American public has not
[2:48:33.400 --> 2:48:39.280]  fully seen yet is use his platform to set about a war on child trafficking make
[2:48:39.280 --> 2:48:43.640]  it public make it a high-profile thing so that at the local level what we're
[2:48:43.640 --> 2:48:48.240]  seeing right now is it's just like Trump said the illegals don't come here and it
[2:48:48.240 --> 2:48:52.520]  got cut by 69% just the statement let these people know we're coming we're
[2:48:52.520 --> 2:48:56.440]  hunting you you're not on the offense now you're on the defense and when we
[2:48:56.440 --> 2:49:00.680]  catch you we're gonna break your goddamn neck yeah look in some cases there
[2:49:00.680 --> 2:49:04.880]  be a truck full of drugs and there are children in there being trafficked and
[2:49:04.880 --> 2:49:08.680]  some of the local law enforcement look at that and they're like oh we're we're
[2:49:08.680 --> 2:49:12.600]  not gonna interview the children because that's kind of PC I thought of you I
[2:49:12.600 --> 2:49:15.920]  thought of you I thought of you a month ago and this week they'll catch a
[2:49:15.920 --> 2:49:20.120]  trailer with 170 something people I'm like and a bunch of more kids and we
[2:49:20.120 --> 2:49:23.880]  know a lot of it's sex trafficking and then exactly the cops don't even do
[2:49:23.880 --> 2:49:26.760]  anything because of political correctness they don't want to be racist
[2:49:26.760 --> 2:49:32.120]  racist help those kids that are slaves let me ask you this is a federal officer
[2:49:32.120 --> 2:49:35.640]  as well they can get into all that why are they always leaving the trucks
[2:49:35.640 --> 2:49:40.480]  everywhere in Texas but they're fine a new truck every two days yeah well
[2:49:40.480 --> 2:49:44.680]  that the cartel have a lot of money and they can they can leave trucks so they
[2:49:44.680 --> 2:49:48.160]  steal trucks and they why do they keep just leaving trucks full of hundreds of
[2:49:48.160 --> 2:49:52.800]  people what what's the point well I don't know specifically why that is
[2:49:52.800 --> 2:49:57.400]  happening that's not really the the area of my focus recently I could dig
[2:49:57.400 --> 2:50:01.040]  around and probably come up with some answers with a little time but what
[2:50:01.040 --> 2:50:06.200]  we're finding is that there is no real system or or culture as Mad Dog Madis
[2:50:06.200 --> 2:50:11.760]  said for going against this and taking the children and exploiting the
[2:50:11.760 --> 2:50:16.080]  information that that can be gained from interviewing them and bringing them
[2:50:16.080 --> 2:50:20.680]  those children into a safe harbor and learning how they got there who sent them
[2:50:20.680 --> 2:50:24.920]  and and what and what the whole deal was so we need to pursue the child
[2:50:24.920 --> 2:50:29.760]  trafficking aspect as hard as the narcotics because it's no good to
[2:50:29.760 --> 2:50:35.280]  process the narcotics and a bus and this is the children back exactly and
[2:50:35.280 --> 2:50:39.200]  then Obama used this whole thing of kids coming to America as we're being
[2:50:39.200 --> 2:50:44.480]  loving when in truth it's the cover for the bonanza of the kids coming in it's
[2:50:44.480 --> 2:50:49.000]  just all hidden in plain view good lord we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen

[2:54:09.680 --> 2:54:15.560]  that we're not sociopaths we're not psychopaths we have morals we have a
[2:54:15.560 --> 2:54:18.800]  conscience which is really just ingrained in us so we don't destroy our
[2:54:18.800 --> 2:54:22.320]  society around us I mean I can have evil thoughts I could I could I could do
[2:54:22.320 --> 2:54:27.880]  nasty things I don't want to but then we kind of get intimidated by all these
[2:54:27.880 --> 2:54:31.560]  evil people into not admitting what they're doing because it's so outlandish
[2:54:31.560 --> 2:54:36.320]  but they're coming out in the open and I believe it's a symbol of their weakness
[2:54:36.320 --> 2:54:41.200]  they believe they were all powerful now it's being proven that they aren't you
[2:54:41.200 --> 2:54:43.560]  know I'm not tooting my horn about what we're doing here because I'm not made out
[2:54:43.560 --> 2:54:47.640]  of money but I know Craig's a great guy great sources make great TV shows and
[2:54:47.640 --> 2:54:51.560]  things before so this is a great thing to just I'm a part owner involved in and
[2:54:51.560 --> 2:54:54.960]  I just you know put a hundred thousand dollars in to the TV production he's
[2:54:54.960 --> 2:54:58.600]  doing because they were censoring him they were blocking him on PayPal they
[2:54:58.600 --> 2:55:01.560]  were blocking him from his you know they're constantly trying to block his
[2:55:01.560 --> 2:55:05.120]  website because they know who he is and you know the things he's done in the
[2:55:05.120 --> 2:55:07.880]  Navy Seals you don't want to get into and you know the fact that he's so
[2:55:07.880 --> 2:55:11.760]  credible they're trying to block him and I know when they're trying to block
[2:55:11.760 --> 2:55:17.040]  something I need to support it well you've done the same thing for us folks

[2:56:39.880 --> 2:56:42.800]  our families I know you don't want to get into that personally but this is
[2:56:42.800 --> 2:56:47.000]  epidemic but I think what you're saying is it's time to get up and get on the
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:52.240]  march and call this out and if we just start taking action distance and you
[2:56:52.240 --> 2:56:56.720]  know targeting and the rest of it we're gonna win absolutely Alex I have people

[2:57:00.560 --> 2:57:04.120]  that they could do more well this is this is their day this is their
[2:57:04.120 --> 2:57:08.760]  opportunity now we can all do something there's more than one way to fight for
[2:57:08.760 --> 2:57:12.000]  your country and it doesn't always involve putting on a helmet and going
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:15.760]  halfway around the world and fighting wars in an open field this is this is a
[2:57:15.760 --> 2:57:19.800]  war against our children we could compromise this operation of the
[2:57:19.800 --> 2:57:24.240]  opposition that's hunting our children and doing the unthinkable to them we can
[2:57:24.240 --> 2:57:29.040]  expose it we can dog them we can report it and we can interdict and stop them at
[2:57:29.040 --> 2:57:34.160]  every front if if we as an American citizenry unite against it so that's
[2:57:34.160 --> 2:57:37.160]  what we're trying to do here that's for child rescue is really recruit the
[2:57:37.160 --> 2:57:42.720]  American citizen to help us watch for this and and report it wherever they
[2:57:42.720 --> 2:57:48.520]  see any signs of it and educate them on what to look for absolutely and expanding
[2:57:48.520 --> 2:57:53.680]  on that we see the globalists and all their energy right now that's
[2:57:53.680 --> 2:57:58.400]  desperation we've just destroyed Hillary their big god their big messiah

[3:00:48.440 --> 3:00:52.560]  minutes left in this segment we're not bitching or whining but but I take
[3:00:52.560 --> 3:00:57.560]  resistance as a sign like I'm a little a missile that's heat-seeking but I don't
[3:00:57.560 --> 3:01:01.600]  go off heat I go off resistance and that's why I always end up really hitting
[3:01:01.600 --> 3:01:06.580]  dad on so I point my nose right at the attack you you were telling me just on
[3:01:06.580 --> 3:01:09.400]  the phone a month ago or so when you're else here in person since this all
[3:01:09.400 --> 3:01:13.160]  started your investigation of the pedo rings all hell is broken loose like
[3:01:13.160 --> 3:01:16.160]  nothing in your whole career I mean nothing you saw in combat and you're
[3:01:16.160 --> 3:01:21.800]  saying it's all sides yeah yeah you know people warn me hey don't don't pick up
[3:01:21.800 --> 3:01:26.320]  this this fight unless you're you're ready for that and I felt like I had to
[3:01:26.320 --> 3:01:30.440]  whether or not I felt like I was ready I felt like this was a mission that fell
[3:01:30.440 --> 3:01:37.320]  into my lap that I was I must carry out so I'm doing it and for every scumbag
[3:01:37.320 --> 3:01:42.040]  obstacle that that's thrown at us from the evil side there's there's a really
[3:01:42.040 --> 3:01:47.520]  rejuvenating and encouraging save from the side of good so it's it's a it's a
[3:01:47.520 --> 3:01:51.680]  dark and ugly fight Alex there's a comforting spirit there's a comforting
[3:01:51.680 --> 3:01:55.880]  spirit and it's we're doing the right thing and it you can't buy that Alex
[3:01:55.880 --> 3:02:00.640]  I don't care I would rather be me with five dollars in my pocket than George
[3:02:00.640 --> 3:02:05.000]  Soros with his billions any day absolutely about to die and go burn in
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:10.480]  hell for eternity for what he's doing I'm at peace with myself I feel good
[3:02:10.480 --> 3:02:14.320]  about what I'm doing for the kids I feel like I'm doing the right thing I'm
[3:02:14.320 --> 3:02:18.000]  trying but that shows their power with the with the big banks and the
[3:02:18.000 --> 3:02:22.120]  publications in Hollywood and everywhere you do this boy they come at me it
[3:02:22.120 --> 3:02:27.800]  shows they're powerful yeah yeah well now but it but it goes you're you're
[3:02:27.800 --> 3:02:32.440]  right they at the top they they want to stop it because they can only survive
[3:02:32.440 --> 3:02:38.720]  by deception secrecy and just this well back to the deceptive hiding down in the
[3:02:38.720 --> 3:02:43.360]  sewer like at the clown but along the way you know we deal business with a lot
[3:02:43.360 --> 3:02:47.120]  of people man chefs departments banks of different things they're all like when
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:50.240]  they learn more about what we're doing they're like God bless you go get them
[3:02:50.240 --> 3:02:55.880]  we're we're with you 100% so it really is encouraging separating the good from
[3:02:55.880 --> 3:03:01.720]  the evil we've got to do this because it demarcades who's who yeah it really does
[3:03:01.720 --> 3:03:06.040]  it really does any decent American citizen or any citizen around the
[3:03:06.040 --> 3:03:10.160]  globe really they're they're behind us and and saying hey let's let's let's
[3:03:10.160 --> 3:03:15.040]  safeguard our children from these evil scumbags and so hey we expect the attacks
[3:03:15.040 --> 3:03:17.720]  you know all the all the tech companies you know with all their
[3:03:17.720 --> 3:03:21.760]  interference and stuff online all that it's that's to be expected so we're
[3:03:21.760 --> 3:03:25.840]  just working through it it's well look at the big tech companies are promoting
[3:03:25.840 --> 3:03:30.080]  pedophilia everywhere publicly I mean I gotta be honest when Salon has that guy
[3:03:30.080 --> 3:03:33.920]  drooling over a five-year-old girl I mean it makes me really want to get on
[3:03:33.920 --> 3:03:39.680]  an airplane despicable despicable look strong people help the helpless and the
[3:03:39.680 --> 3:03:45.120]  weak abuse them it's it's really the weak people fall into evil Alex and
[3:03:45.120 --> 3:03:49.560]  abuse whatever money or authority they have and the strong people use those
[3:03:49.560 --> 3:03:55.080]  things for good to help the less fortunate so shame on them your spirit
[3:03:55.080 --> 3:03:58.440]  tell you we're starting to turn the tide against evil or we just almost to the
[3:03:58.440 --> 3:04:01.240]  top of the hill because I they are fighting so hard they're desperate
[3:04:01.240 --> 3:04:05.000]  they're scared I think they're on the run I say I see it the way that you do
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:11.080]  after all the type of conflict up and trained on and and experience that Alex
[3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:16.880]  I see this frantic desperation as a sign that they are on the run talking
[3:04:16.880 --> 3:04:21.160]  about those who are involved in evil I think they frantically are trying to
[3:04:21.160 --> 3:04:25.720]  grasp at straws at anything they can don't maintain the deception and the
[3:04:25.720 --> 3:04:30.120]  secrecy that they've existed behind until now I think Donald Trump and then
[3:04:30.120 --> 3:04:37.920]  and his new administration are a huge threat to that and I think they are
[3:04:37.920 --> 3:04:41.680]  frantic there's right they can feel it they can feel it it's not that Trump's
[3:04:41.680 --> 3:04:46.000]  perfect it's that they can feel he's not out to get people he's not a pedophile
[3:04:46.000 --> 3:04:50.400]  Craig Sawyer Joe Vicks here with info wars.com today I want to talk to you
[3:04:50.400 --> 3:04:55.640]  about guns why we have them why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have
[3:04:55.640 --> 3:05:00.000]  them and why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail
[3:05:00.000 --> 3:05:04.200]  against it in the press I believe every good journalist needs to know why the
[3:05:04.200 --> 3:05:08.640]  second amendment must be considered more essential than the first amendment this
[3:05:08.640 --> 3:05:13.640]  may be a bitter pill to swallow but the right to keep and bear arms is not an
[3:05:13.640 --> 3:05:18.520]  outdated dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the red
[3:05:18.520 --> 3:05:24.840]  coats no it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776 the
[3:05:24.840 --> 3:05:28.400]  original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain 10 of what the
[3:05:28.400 --> 3:05:33.280]  constitutional framers termed unalienable rights the Bill of Rights came to us
[3:05:33.280 --> 3:05:37.880]  with blinders on it doesn't recognize color or class or wealth it protects
[3:05:37.880 --> 3:05:42.800]  not just the rights of actors or editors or reporters but extends even to those
[3:05:42.800 --> 3:05:47.680]  we love to hate this is a small excerpt from Tralton Heston after being sold

[3:08:24.000 --> 3:08:30.800]  matter gunning police down he called them savages i think the kkk outburning
[3:08:30.800 --> 3:08:36.120]  crosses of people's yards are savages and i think black folks who are racist
[3:08:36.120 --> 3:08:41.280]  shooting random cops in the back are savages to them that's a term we use
[3:08:41.280 --> 3:08:46.760]  for scumbags and i think the people out looting all over florida the caribbean
[3:08:46.760 --> 3:08:55.080]  are thugs as well but the media says you're racist if you point that up well
[3:08:55.080 --> 3:09:00.440]  that political correctness doesn't work anymore i i rarely jump into antsy's

[3:09:20.720 --> 3:09:26.480]  damnation glitterbug churches where you worship the preacher but as a christian
[3:09:26.480 --> 3:09:30.640]  reading the bible a world government got to have this mark in your hand or
[3:09:30.640 --> 3:09:36.720]  forehead to buy and sell i can politically imagine just as a citizen or
[3:09:36.720 --> 3:09:41.560]  just as a human what hitler would have done with the technology like that and
[3:09:41.560 --> 3:09:46.280]  now in sweden and other areas they're trying to push the public having it to
[3:09:46.280 --> 3:09:50.640]  replace credit cards in your keys and over to give you discounts if you do it
[3:09:50.640 --> 3:09:57.240]  and oh cyber security we've lost so many people's ids and there's so many
[3:09:57.240 --> 3:10:00.920]  databases you got to go to face scans or hand scans but somebody can fake that
[3:10:00.920 --> 3:10:06.120]  we need to have a microchip in your hand which thieves of course can then
[3:10:06.120 --> 3:10:13.000]  digitally scan and steal as well oh then it's gonna be a biological mark mixed
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:18.240]  with your dna or a nano tech chip in the hand that no one can copy that's
[3:10:18.240 --> 3:10:22.360]  really where they want to go so you just heard the rest of the story as paul
[3:10:22.360 --> 3:10:27.280]  harvey would say it's a nano tech chip but i love the political correctness
[3:10:27.280 --> 3:10:31.480]  there in a sweden the home of stockholm syndrome being a victim and loving it
[3:10:31.480 --> 3:10:35.880]  where they tell you let muslims rape you police chief you know just let
[3:10:35.880 --> 3:10:39.840]  terrorists in the schools we can learn from terrorists close quote you say
[3:10:39.840 --> 3:10:43.440]  that sounds crazy no it's not if the police can say we're gonna let people
[3:10:43.440 --> 3:10:47.320]  rape you we're gonna put returning ices in schools and we're gonna give them
[3:10:47.320 --> 3:10:52.440]  preferential welfare you'll put up with the government doing stuff so it is a
[3:10:52.440 --> 3:10:58.240]  induction of stockholm syndrome so the story is linked on the right hand side
[3:10:58.240 --> 3:11:03.960]  it was the top story earlier it's moved down of drudge report dot com we'll put
[3:11:03.960 --> 3:11:08.800]  that on screen it's an image of an x-ray of a hand with the microchip in it and
[3:11:08.800 --> 3:11:13.760]  the story is a paul watch an article on news wars dot com and info wars dot
[3:11:13.760 --> 3:11:19.160]  com implanted microchip to replace credit cards car keys a microchip embedded
[3:11:19.160 --> 3:11:22.960]  under the skin will replace credit cards and keys according to a steven ray who
[3:11:22.960 --> 3:11:26.600]  has already overseen a program for sweden's largest state-owned train
[3:11:26.600 --> 3:11:31.280]  operator that allows customers to scan their chips instead of using tickets so
[3:11:31.280 --> 3:11:35.080]  where it's going is making you do it he was first like oh driverless cars cool
[3:11:35.080 --> 3:11:38.320]  but then they go actually we're gonna overcharge you on insurance till you
[3:11:38.320 --> 3:11:42.560]  can't afford it we're gonna make you have a robot drive your car see bbc news
[3:11:42.560 --> 3:11:48.240]  showcase the system in which swedes are able to have their embedded chip scan by
[3:11:48.240 --> 3:11:53.000]  conductor who uses an app to match up their chip membership number with a
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:11:57.240]  purchase ticket around 3,000 people in sweden have already had the chip embedded
[3:11:57.240 --> 3:12:02.000]  in their hand in order to access secure areas of buildings in mexico's done the
[3:12:02.000 --> 3:12:08.560]  same many other areas military's done it and then it becomes ubiquitous you're
[3:12:08.560 --> 3:12:13.960]  an animal marked the control but suddenly since this is all admitted we
[3:12:13.960 --> 3:12:17.920]  don't hear churches complaining anymore back in the 80s and 90s it was fun to
[3:12:17.920 --> 3:12:22.040]  say this but we'll all be raptured for it happens right even though it's not even
[3:12:22.040 --> 3:12:26.740]  in the Bible until after the devil comes and then God comes back and then the
[3:12:26.740 --> 3:12:30.160]  dead are raised all that but whatever it's the ultimate cop-out and I'm not
[3:12:30.160 --> 3:12:33.680]  judging anybody my whole point is I guess you're just gonna go well I must
[3:12:33.680 --> 3:12:37.300]  already been raptured to get our chips in heaven even if you're a devil
[3:12:37.300 --> 3:12:41.480]  worshipper you shouldn't want to have a dog tag you know embedded in you because
[3:12:41.480 --> 3:12:45.040]  you're too dumb to have a wallet it's it's insane so I'm gonna Anthony Kumi's
[3:12:45.040 --> 3:12:48.680]  take on this but here is the ridiculous lecturing like we're
[3:12:48.680 --> 3:12:54.040]  kindergartners selling us the wonderful beast chip which they said was never
[3:12:54.040 --> 3:13:01.240]  gonna come here it is here it is wow that's what I can touch it yeah
[3:13:01.240 --> 3:13:06.640]  look at that it's so cool Stefan Ray works for Sweden's largest train
[3:13:06.640 --> 3:13:12.040]  operating company it's a science world to begin using microchips that's the
[3:13:12.040 --> 3:13:19.000]  under the skin as train tickets this microchip implants sits right here
[3:13:19.000 --> 3:13:24.480]  30 seconds before you die my skin here comes the ticket officer this is our
[3:13:24.480 --> 3:13:29.840]  chance to see if that works each passenger with a microchip must be
[3:13:29.840 --> 3:13:34.760]  registered with a membership number the microchip holds this number then they
[3:13:34.760 --> 3:13:41.720]  jump into a meat grinder converted from a woodchipper validation so it shows
[3:13:41.720 --> 3:13:48.400]  the tickets our names and it all came from that yeah then she beats you in
[3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:52.880]  the head with a hammer for fun privacy the solution we found was such privacy
[3:13:52.880 --> 3:13:59.360]  membership number that won't be telling anyone anything about you oh outside our
[3:13:59.360 --> 3:14:06.440]  company oh there's no transmitter here so you can't be tracked like the GPS so
[3:14:06.440 --> 3:14:11.600]  not even any questions here because there's a trendy thousand people in
[3:14:11.600 --> 3:14:14.520]  Sweden have a microchip this is a trendy black guy that everyone will go I've got
[3:14:14.520 --> 3:14:18.200]  to have it around races you could use like blow your brains out of your races
[3:14:18.200 --> 3:14:22.960]  there was like shoving guns in their mouths I'm gonna skip this break because I
[3:14:22.960 --> 3:14:26.080]  don't steal time in the fourth hour I just skip breaks we're gonna skip this
[3:14:26.080 --> 3:14:31.000]  break and the 50 so Anthony gets his seven minutes back compound media dot
[3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:36.160]  com Anthony I mean this is reaching cuckoo land here meanwhile we've got
[3:14:36.160 --> 3:14:40.040]  Hillary all over the news because this isn't like some Bible thumping show I'm
[3:14:40.040 --> 3:14:44.280]  a Christian but I'm not pushing that but the but now all over the news we've
[3:14:44.280 --> 3:14:49.400]  got Democrats saying we kill people with hexes we're into voodoo what they are is
[3:14:49.400 --> 3:14:53.280]  a bunch of crazy Harry Potter loons it's even worse than devil worshipers
[3:14:53.280 --> 3:14:57.080]  they're completely insane and believe they have magic powers like they're like
[3:14:57.080 --> 3:15:04.080]  demonic leprechauns what's going on here it gets crazier and crazier by the
[3:15:04.080 --> 3:15:09.160]  week by the day first I got to say something Alex man how proud were you
[3:15:09.160 --> 3:15:13.320]  of your state Texas the rest of the country watching during a hurricane
[3:15:13.320 --> 3:15:18.320]  Harvey and watching people able to take care of themselves self-sufficient
[3:15:18.320 --> 3:15:23.200]  helping their neighbors during a disaster not sitting and waiting for other
[3:15:23.200 --> 3:15:28.400]  people to come and tell them how they should take care of themselves and
[3:15:28.400 --> 3:15:32.680]  their loved ones it was amazing to watch quite frankly what it was was racist oh
[3:15:32.680 --> 3:15:37.840]  well of course it was Alex of course it was but it was amazing to watch people
[3:15:37.840 --> 3:15:41.600]  I've been getting serious everybody of every color helping each other and then
[3:15:41.600 --> 3:15:45.760]  Charlie Hebdo's has how Hitler flooded but no you're absolutely right people say
[3:15:45.760 --> 3:15:49.760]  Texas is different how is that so alien that we actually were able to take care
[3:15:49.760 --> 3:15:53.800]  of each other that's weird it was amazing to watch especially in the
[3:15:53.800 --> 3:15:58.120]  Communist Republic of New York where we watched it and it was it was stunning to
[3:15:58.120 --> 3:16:03.360]  watch people actually not need people to swoop in they did I mean we have an
[3:16:03.360 --> 3:16:08.960]  amazing emergency response in this country but they weren't needed that
[3:16:08.960 --> 3:16:11.760]  second people actually knew how to take care of themselves and it was
[3:16:11.760 --> 3:16:18.560]  refreshing to watch on the on this whole chip implantation thing oh my god
[3:16:18.560 --> 3:16:25.320]  this is what they do they present things to you as a convenience no one when
[3:16:25.320 --> 3:16:29.480]  we thought years ago about things like this it was science fiction and we
[3:16:29.480 --> 3:16:33.680]  always imagined the government would knock on your door and say they're
[3:16:33.680 --> 3:16:37.960]  implanting chips and you'd have to run and hide it we are getting these things
[3:16:37.960 --> 3:16:42.800]  these devices like our phones and everything else because we cannot live
[3:16:42.800 --> 3:16:48.400]  without them they have made it so important in our lives to have these
[3:16:48.400 --> 3:16:52.360]  wonderful conveniences you don't want to wait on the the big long line at the
[3:16:52.360 --> 3:16:57.320]  toll booth we have easy pass it's easy look you're going right past all the
[3:16:57.320 --> 3:17:01.400]  suckers that is still paying cash meanwhile it's being used in courts
[3:17:01.400 --> 3:17:07.760]  around the country for things like divorce divorce proceedings and your
[3:17:07.760 --> 3:17:12.440]  privacy is completely and they catch them over charging people that's the
[3:17:12.440 --> 3:17:15.720]  thing I'm all for technology the problem is it's so complex with Trojan
[3:17:15.720 --> 3:17:20.600]  horses it's always used to screw us over so I want to prosecute and have the
[3:17:20.600 --> 3:17:24.000]  public aware the companies that are watching and listening I'm all for
[3:17:24.000 --> 3:17:28.080]  technology but stop letting people just as I have a door on my house that's
[3:17:28.080 --> 3:17:31.600]  technology doesn't mean you have an excuse to have the key to it and come in
[3:17:31.600 --> 3:17:36.640]  whenever you want if you don't live there we are allowing this to happen
[3:17:36.640 --> 3:17:41.480]  though because most of the masses out there Alex are not savvy to any of this
[3:17:41.480 --> 3:17:48.120]  they they invite in things like Alexa and put it on their tables at their in
[3:17:48.120 --> 3:17:53.160]  their home is listening to them it's listening your television your smart
[3:17:53.160 --> 3:17:59.440]  TV it's so convenient to just say hey TV put on HBO or something and meanwhile
[3:17:59.440 --> 3:18:04.160]  while you're talking in your room having a private conversation these things are
[3:18:04.160 --> 3:18:07.880]  listening to what you're saying and the tech giants go it's okay we put the
[3:18:07.880 --> 3:18:13.840]  terms of service Samsung said watch what you say right it's in the terms of
[3:18:13.840 --> 3:18:19.040]  service so who reads that no one really reads those things so you're inviting
[3:18:19.040 --> 3:18:24.280]  spies into your house and a lot of people say well if you have nothing to
[3:18:24.280 --> 3:18:32.280]  hide what's the problem well the problem is freedom of speech is is a thing
[3:18:32.280 --> 3:18:38.240]  that's almost extinct at this point between the these indoctrination centers
[3:18:38.240 --> 3:18:43.440]  that are supposed to be colleges and mainstream media so when you're when
[3:18:43.440 --> 3:18:49.000]  you're talking in private in your own home and people are listening to this
[3:18:49.000 --> 3:18:54.360]  you could say what they dub the wrong thing let's go further than that let's
[3:18:54.360 --> 3:18:57.440]  go further it's just like people that would put on Facebook and Twitter I'm
[3:18:57.440 --> 3:19:00.880]  going out of town to Cancun and their address here's all the stuff I got for
[3:19:00.880 --> 3:19:05.520]  Christmas they use it to rob you just because you have nothing to hide we have
[3:19:05.520 --> 3:19:10.160]  doors and windows to stop mosquitoes to stop criminals we have privacy cuz
[3:19:10.160 --> 3:19:13.920]  we're private it's like saying do I have something to hide cuz I don't take my
[3:19:13.920 --> 3:19:18.280]  wife out on the front lawn to have sex you know you know privacy is part of
[3:19:18.280 --> 3:19:22.320]  being free it's not that I'm bad or hiding something I got a door on the
[3:19:22.320 --> 3:19:28.640]  bathroom for reasons yeah and and we've got we've grown so used to our phones
[3:19:28.640 --> 3:19:34.520]  being something we cannot leave the house without and these are tracking
[3:19:34.520 --> 3:19:39.480]  devices these are devices that we are giving up our freedoms our privacies
[3:19:39.480 --> 3:19:44.680]  our liberty with this device but it's gone to the point where people are
[3:19:44.680 --> 3:19:49.320]  saying hey they could leave that at home lead so so we don't want them doing
[3:19:49.320 --> 3:19:53.920]  that we want to be able to constantly track them let's put it a chip implanted
[3:19:53.920 --> 3:20:01.720]  in them so they can get train tickets easier shop easier and be tracked where
[3:20:01.720 --> 3:20:05.600]  you're going and then they use it to see even more and the answer is oh go to
[3:20:05.600 --> 3:20:09.120]  biometrics go to a chip now I'm gonna gather cuz you've got stuff to cover
[3:20:09.120 --> 3:20:12.680]  but Anthony I want to ask you about the state of the country where you see
[3:20:12.680 --> 3:20:17.400]  things going all of it but since you mentioned it I'm gonna be honest I let
[3:20:17.400 --> 3:20:20.520]  my children when they're gonna go to the mall with friends or go to a sporting
[3:20:20.520 --> 3:20:23.960]  event have one of the smart phones they've got phones I don't give them to
[3:20:23.960 --> 3:20:26.960]  them all the time but I may have to get rid of them because all they talk about
[3:20:26.960 --> 3:20:30.960]  the phones all they ever wants the phones and their studies out showing it's
[3:20:30.960 --> 3:20:34.680]  causing them to not be social people are texting to each other across the deal I
[3:20:34.680 --> 3:20:37.600]  know I'm on them too much I know I'm on at dinner my wife's like what are you
[3:20:37.600 --> 3:20:41.240]  doing even though I've got work to do I get it it just brings work with you
[3:20:41.240 --> 3:20:44.440]  everywhere because if I stayed at the office I'd always be working I'm supposed
[3:20:44.440 --> 3:20:48.360]  to go home to stop it for a little while and so it's ending compartmentalization
[3:20:48.360 --> 3:20:51.840]  so there's a lot of great stuff about them but they admit lowering IQ lowering
[3:20:51.840 --> 3:20:55.720]  connectivity lowering people having relationships and Tucker Carlson asked
[3:20:55.720 --> 3:21:01.120]  has smart phones destroyed a generation and the answer is I can totally control
[3:21:01.120 --> 3:21:04.960]  my children with just them having and not having the phone better than my dad
[3:21:04.960 --> 3:21:09.480]  could ever meet which asked me how powerful is this technology here's
[3:21:09.480 --> 3:21:12.640]  here's the clip and we'll get Anthony Kumi he's hosting right now
[3:21:12.640 --> 3:21:18.640]  compoundmedia.com will get his take so I found with teens for example that those
[3:21:18.640 --> 3:21:23.920]  who spent more time on screen say social media and texting were less happy more
[3:21:23.920 --> 3:21:28.880]  depressed and actually had even more risk factors for suicide and there's
[3:21:28.880 --> 3:21:32.280]  other studies that have found the same thing there's a couple for example that
[3:21:32.280 --> 3:21:36.880]  followed people over time found the more they use social media the more unhappy
[3:21:36.880 --> 3:21:40.320]  they were and it unhappiness didn't lead to social media use so it wasn't the
[3:21:40.320 --> 3:21:46.360]  other way around that just seems like a really important fact so I see the
[3:21:46.360 --> 3:21:50.000]  coverage of the iPhone and I have one sitting on the desk right here which I
[3:21:50.000 --> 3:21:53.880]  use a lot too much so I'm part of the problem but I see the coverage and it's
[3:21:53.880 --> 3:21:59.120]  this breathless technology reporting but I never hear anybody mention the
[3:21:59.120 --> 3:22:04.200]  obvious which is the more you use this thing the less happy you be correct I
[3:22:04.200 --> 3:22:09.720]  mean that seems like a salient point no yeah absolutely and you know I think
[3:22:09.720 --> 3:22:12.640]  it's really having effect on young people so I've done this work on
[3:22:12.640 --> 3:22:17.560]  generational differences for about 25 years and around 2012 I started to see
[3:22:17.560 --> 3:22:21.640]  some really striking patterns in these very large national surveys that are
[3:22:21.640 --> 3:22:27.920]  done of teens their mental health started to really deteriorate right around
[3:22:27.920 --> 3:22:31.800]  let's stop right there my children listen to me but they tend to not to I'm
[3:22:31.800 --> 3:22:35.680]  gonna go home tonight I'm gonna show them this because here's what I found I've
[3:22:35.680 --> 3:22:38.960]  done experiments on my children I'm just gonna be honest we all do it you do
[3:22:38.960 --> 3:22:42.800]  experience see what they listen to what they don't what gets their attention
[3:22:42.800 --> 3:22:47.560]  I've done weekends where I go here have the phones they're all gone in their
[3:22:47.560 --> 3:22:51.800]  rooms like zombies and then the next day they're like stumbling around I take
[3:22:51.800 --> 3:22:55.120]  the phones away they're painting they want to go see a ball game they want to
[3:22:55.120 --> 3:22:58.480]  go the movies they want to go hiking they want to you know whatever they're
[3:22:58.480 --> 3:23:02.840]  alive so I'm telling them I've made the decision I'm gonna basically take the
[3:23:02.840 --> 3:23:06.160]  phones except when they go on an excursion and they go that's how I know my
[3:23:06.160 --> 3:23:10.320]  friends blah blah so Anthony I'm gonna turn it over to you now but just profound
[3:23:10.320 --> 3:23:15.280]  video the full videos up on info wars dot com what are your experiences with
[3:23:15.280 --> 3:23:18.840]  us it's not like we're troglodytes and hate technology but it's not just that
[3:23:18.840 --> 3:23:24.720]  expert as you know screen time phones particularly Facebook documents they
[3:23:24.720 --> 3:23:28.400]  know their users they're controlling them especially liberals they want to keep
[3:23:28.400 --> 3:23:32.040]  them alone keep them desperate they really believe Nazis are under the table
[3:23:32.040 --> 3:23:36.040]  I mean these are mind control devices you take over brother compound media dot
[3:23:36.040 --> 3:23:41.520]  com thanks for letting me jump in with you thanks Alex yeah I honestly believe
[3:23:41.520 --> 3:23:48.240]  the advent of the phone the cell phone smartphone what what have you will
[3:23:48.240 --> 3:23:55.320]  history will show it to have changed humanity to have literally changed
[3:23:55.320 --> 3:24:01.680]  humanity like perhaps like the first ships that carried us across the oceans
[3:24:01.680 --> 3:24:08.360]  did it's gonna be so monumental in changing the way that that people talk
[3:24:08.360 --> 3:24:14.160]  to each other and interact with each other back just a few years ago and I
[3:24:14.160 --> 3:24:19.040]  don't think you're gonna be able to really see the the effects of this for
[3:24:19.040 --> 3:24:22.560]  years to come but we're seeing it very early on because relatively speaking
[3:24:22.560 --> 3:24:28.600]  this is a blip that we've had this technology and already you can see how
[3:24:28.600 --> 3:24:34.800]  it's affecting our societies but we won't really see it for quite a few years
[3:24:34.800 --> 3:24:40.760]  but here's what I've noticed things that used to be commonplace are non-existent
[3:24:40.760 --> 3:24:50.280]  anymore the the wooing of a girl the the the classic dance of romance where you
[3:24:50.280 --> 3:24:59.360]  actually had to face a woman or a man if you're a woman and talk to them you
[3:24:59.360 --> 3:25:05.560]  had to have something that was called game you it was very nerve-wracking to
[3:25:05.560 --> 3:25:11.800]  be able to walk up to somebody and open a conversation it took talent it took
[3:25:11.800 --> 3:25:18.360]  finesse you had to read the person as you're doing this this wasn't as easy as
[3:25:18.360 --> 3:25:23.120]  sending out interrupt you're so amazing you're right in five years the phones
[3:25:23.120 --> 3:25:31.200]  have killed mammal mating dances this was a classic yes mating ritual like you
[3:25:31.200 --> 3:25:37.560]  see with birds and their plumage we had a finesse and and and people that were
[3:25:37.560 --> 3:25:44.280]  good at it did well people that didn't didn't do as well now you put out 800
[3:25:44.280 --> 3:25:52.760]  fish hooks in the water through various apps dating apps Facebook other social
[3:25:52.760 --> 3:25:57.480]  media texting you don't need you could just say hey do you want to do this do
[3:25:57.480 --> 3:26:02.220]  you want to do that whether it's an you're asking literally for sex or to go
[3:26:02.220 --> 3:26:07.480]  out on a date and if you get a no you just move on to the next thing no skin
[3:26:07.480 --> 3:26:14.200]  off your nose so it really has affected you're right it's 800 fish hooks it's 800
[3:26:14.200 --> 3:26:17.440]  fish hooks and I've noticed people that are involved in this whole thing they're
[3:26:17.440 --> 3:26:22.800]  not as into it anymore it's not as electric it's ruined yes it's like any
[3:26:22.800 --> 3:26:28.360]  other narcotic you're never gonna get that rush that you got the first time
[3:26:28.360 --> 3:26:35.000]  you you used it so again it is like a drug you talk about how kids on the next
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:41.720]  day it's that's a hangover there there is such thing as an iPhone or technology
[3:26:41.720 --> 3:26:46.600]  hangover the next morning where you just don't feel good your eyes are fuzzy your
[3:26:46.600 --> 3:26:49.960]  head hurts yeah we've all done it haven't you ever had a jag like seven
[3:26:49.960 --> 3:26:54.560]  hours you're up all night you just what the where'd the time go absolutely we
[3:26:54.560 --> 3:26:59.400]  all and it's it was funny to watch Tucker talk about that and say look I know
[3:26:59.400 --> 3:27:04.080]  I'm on it too much also we all know what we're doing and we all know it's not
[3:27:04.080 --> 3:27:11.120]  good but we continue to do it it's been placed in our hands and we are incapable
[3:27:11.120 --> 3:27:21.040]  of being without it have you ever left the house and went oh my god you turn
[3:27:21.040 --> 3:27:25.920]  the car around no matter where you where you are in your journey because you can't
[3:27:25.920 --> 3:27:32.600]  go a day without your phone and it's it's unbelievable when that when I was a
[3:27:32.600 --> 3:27:38.480]  younger man and after school you'd you'd hang out with your friends or or you
[3:27:38.480 --> 3:27:43.520]  make plans for the weekend you needed to know what everyone was doing by Friday
[3:27:43.520 --> 3:27:48.840]  and that was fun to get together and plan things right because if you didn't
[3:27:48.840 --> 3:27:52.920]  plan it you were driving around or walking around looking for your friends
[3:27:52.920 --> 3:27:56.080]  because you literally didn't know where they were it was like you were a
[3:27:56.080 --> 3:28:01.400]  detective trying to trying to find your group of friends now there's none of
[3:28:01.400 --> 3:28:06.360]  that it's easy to find everybody and and hook up and it was you had to plan it
[3:28:06.360 --> 3:28:11.200]  advance you had to have a purpose you had to have somewhere and something you
[3:28:11.200 --> 3:28:15.080]  were gonna do and a place you were gonna go it doesn't make things pointless it
[3:28:15.080 --> 3:28:19.600]  does make things empty because usually get a map out and it was like fun to get
[3:28:19.600 --> 3:28:23.960]  there and wow this is wow you're really smart because I hadn't thought of all
[3:28:23.960 --> 3:28:28.800]  these other things that were going on and how we're being and then don't forget
[3:28:28.800 --> 3:28:32.840]  it has microwave radiation they admit is linked to brain damage so so the brain
[3:28:32.840 --> 3:28:41.240]  cancer so don't forget it also gives you brain cancer and we and we cannot be
[3:28:41.240 --> 3:28:47.360]  without it for any amount of time it's it really is astounding and and you
[3:28:47.360 --> 3:28:51.240]  think about it you would think that this is the most amazing thing ever you
[3:28:51.240 --> 3:28:56.000]  have a complete library in your hand and you would think this would be a great
[3:28:56.000 --> 3:28:59.880]  thing because people would be getting educated and stuff we always go to the
[3:28:59.880 --> 3:29:05.680]  lowest common denominator and and it turns into something so bad and evil and
[3:29:05.680 --> 3:29:10.360]  making people unhappy when you think it's an amazing tool well the easiest way
[3:29:10.360 --> 3:29:13.840]  to dumb it down is it's like never being able to leave work it's just it's
[3:29:13.840 --> 3:29:18.080]  always this portal I am leaving now when I watch the show but Anthony you're up

[3:29:25.120 --> 3:29:28.000]  we're smart enough this is the beginning of understanding technology

[3:30:18.880 --> 3:30:23.240]  leverage do these people in the Federal Reserve have over the American people or
[3:30:23.240 --> 3:30:27.760]  for that matter what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money will you

[3:31:59.760 --> 3:32:04.360]  that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do
[3:32:04.360 --> 3:32:09.360]  today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they
[3:32:09.360 --> 3:32:13.400]  were hunting killing and then processing and so I set out to develop

[3:33:25.400 --> 3:33:33.240]  new iPhone 10 the X the iPhone X is coming out and like Pavlov's dog we're
[3:33:33.240 --> 3:33:39.720]  just gonna run run to the Apple stores to to get it and we're gonna love all
[3:33:39.720 --> 3:33:47.600]  the new features the face scan facial scanning that is how you will unlock
[3:33:47.600 --> 3:33:51.560]  your phone I guess the old fingerprint wasn't good enough because the
[3:33:51.560 --> 3:33:57.520]  fingerprint you need to make contact with the phone for your fingerprint to
[3:33:57.520 --> 3:34:03.800]  work with facial scan you just look at it and it can scan your face and send it
[3:34:03.800 --> 3:34:08.120]  wherever the hell it damn well pleases and then when you walk around and
[3:34:08.120 --> 3:34:14.680]  there's face scanners it will now be able to scan you and know exactly who you
[3:34:14.680 --> 3:34:20.880]  are and all about you because you've put the information in yourself isn't it
[3:34:20.880 --> 3:34:25.200]  amazing oh are they marketing it that way no I guess they're not how are they
[3:34:25.200 --> 3:34:31.760]  marketing it oh it's convenient it's so much more convenient because this that's
[3:34:31.760 --> 3:34:38.200]  just a pain right there that's what what yeah yeah I can't be doing that I want
[3:34:38.200 --> 3:34:43.360]  to just look at it my face will be uploaded somewhere by the way that goes
[3:34:43.360 --> 3:34:51.120]  somewhere and now just like a license plate readers there it is your face is
[3:34:51.120 --> 3:34:57.480]  on record because it's your phone you know whose face it is everything you do
[3:34:57.480 --> 3:35:03.600]  on your phone on a daily basis is linked to that so it sounds innocent enough
[3:35:03.600 --> 3:35:10.080]  what do they use it for well you walk into the mall right and your face gets
[3:35:10.080 --> 3:35:15.920]  scanned and it checks everything you've been doing in a split second and it says
[3:35:15.920 --> 3:35:24.600]  oh this guy apparently it likes sports so let's send something to his phone that
[3:35:24.600 --> 3:35:30.440]  there's a sale at the sporting goods store in the mall that sounds harmless
[3:35:30.440 --> 3:35:34.840]  right and that sound harmless it's convenient maybe you'd be interested in
[3:35:34.840 --> 3:35:39.040]  that that you put your face in there and it knows who you are and what you're
[3:35:39.040 --> 3:35:47.840]  doing another thing could be well it knows your political ideology from your
[3:35:47.840 --> 3:35:53.880]  social media posts and it scans your face and now you're being put on some
[3:35:53.880 --> 3:36:02.440]  type of list some type of list is that good is that convenient no that's scary
[3:36:02.440 --> 3:36:09.080]  that's scary stuff right there so but we'll all run we will all run to the
[3:36:09.080 --> 3:36:15.680]  Apple Store and get it and we'll marvel in the technology and the cameras the
[3:36:15.680 --> 3:36:19.320]  cameras just keep getting better and better they're they're constantly talking
[3:36:19.320 --> 3:36:26.320]  about the wonder of their cameras on the smartphone because the more detail the
[3:36:26.320 --> 3:36:32.120]  better the more detail it's easier to see things in the background and where
[3:36:32.120 --> 3:36:37.600]  you are maybe license plate numbers maybe maybe a document on the on the
[3:36:37.600 --> 3:36:43.000]  table around where you're taking a photo sound paranoid really have you seen
[3:36:43.000 --> 3:36:50.400]  what's going on it's astounding when years ago I would listen to Alex Jones
[3:36:50.400 --> 3:36:54.800]  and there were plenty of people that would just be like what is this guy
[3:36:54.800 --> 3:36:59.760]  talking about have you heard Alex Jones he's talking about this thing and that
[3:36:59.760 --> 3:37:03.320]  they're the globalists and they're looking at us and they're spying on us
[3:37:03.320 --> 3:37:08.840]  and it's coming to fruition it's absolutely coming to fruition and we
[3:37:08.840 --> 3:37:16.200]  are flinging our doors open and allowing this to come into our lives and
[3:37:16.200 --> 3:37:23.080]  reveling in it we love it so yeah I'm just as guilty like I said I will get it
[3:37:23.080 --> 3:37:33.080]  I will get this other things going on I'm not very happy with Donald Trump
[3:37:33.080 --> 3:37:39.760]  today could change in an hour you never know with Donald Trump could change in
[3:37:39.760 --> 3:37:53.000]  an hour but there's the the DACA he was talking about DACA allowing the the
[3:37:53.000 --> 3:38:00.320]  youngsters of illegal aliens to stay in the country because apparently they're
[3:38:00.320 --> 3:38:08.080]  dreamers and they're all amazing I you watch you watch mainstream media they
[3:38:08.080 --> 3:38:14.080]  are all amazing they go to school they get the best grades they have amazing
[3:38:14.080 --> 3:38:20.800]  jobs they help their neighbors everything they're they're the most
[3:38:20.800 --> 3:38:26.920]  amazing Americans ever and Donald Trump if you remember a couple of weeks ago
[3:38:26.920 --> 3:38:31.800]  said hey we're gonna end this whole thing we're gonna end this the dreamer
[3:38:31.800 --> 3:38:40.320]  thing and perhaps even start sending some people back well people got mad the
[3:38:40.320 --> 3:38:51.520]  left liberals Democrats progressives they got angry and Donald Trump decided to
[3:38:51.520 --> 3:38:58.280]  pretty much change his whole viewpoint on this and today he's saying that hey
[3:38:58.280 --> 3:39:02.560]  why would we want to send back people that are doing so well for our country
[3:39:02.560 --> 3:39:10.640]  why send back these dreamers when where do you say they're contributing to
[3:39:10.640 --> 3:39:16.320]  contributing to the country going to school serving in the military there it
[3:39:16.320 --> 3:39:24.440]  is so how is that gonna help out the country well there are for every
[3:39:24.440 --> 3:39:33.000]  dreamer I believe there's an American that needs a job needs an education needs
[3:39:33.000 --> 3:39:41.660]  help and and and that's how I see it this isn't about hating people from
[3:39:41.660 --> 3:39:47.600]  different lands it's about loving America and wanting our country to do well
[3:39:47.600 --> 3:39:55.440]  by wanting Americans to do well and I see this is just for every dreamer
[3:39:55.440 --> 3:40:04.440]  there's an American that could be doing better but he changed he changed his
[3:40:04.440 --> 3:40:10.600]  entire take on this thing so I don't even know what that's about he met with
[3:40:10.600 --> 3:40:17.120]  Pelosi and Chuck Schumer at the White House for dinner I the second I heard
[3:40:17.120 --> 3:40:22.720]  that thank you Pelosi the second I heard that all I thought of was the scene
[3:40:22.720 --> 3:40:28.240]  from Alice in Wonderland the Mad Hatter the Mad Hatter's Tea Party that's how I
[3:40:28.240 --> 3:40:32.920]  pictured that dinner at the White House this Trump with the Mad Hatter hat on
[3:40:32.920 --> 3:40:39.560]  and and these two maniacs at the table but they they had a great time
[3:40:39.560 --> 3:40:46.760]  apparently they had a wonderful time together and sorted out some stuff about
[3:40:46.760 --> 3:40:54.640]  the dreamers and keeping them here and part of the deal does not include
[3:40:54.640 --> 3:41:02.160]  anything about the border wall this border wall during the campaign put
[3:41:02.160 --> 3:41:07.560]  Trump over that is absolutely what put Trump over and and won him the election
[3:41:07.560 --> 3:41:13.880]  was his stance on immigration and all we're seeing him do is backpedal on
[3:41:13.880 --> 3:41:20.760]  everything involving immigration I understand that at certain points he
[3:41:20.760 --> 3:41:26.760]  was he was stopped from doing what he wanted to do by various courts around
[3:41:26.760 --> 3:41:33.360]  the country but he's also changing his mind on things that were huge campaign
[3:41:33.360 --> 3:41:38.480]  promises and not everybody is not everyone's happy about it I'm willing to
[3:41:38.480 --> 3:41:45.480]  give him some time because one thing Trump is known for is this amazing talent
[3:41:45.480 --> 3:41:51.680]  of knowing 15 moves ahead what everyone's gonna do so you get mad at him
[3:41:51.680 --> 3:41:57.760]  and then you realize where he was going with it I assume he wants to show the
[3:41:57.760 --> 3:42:03.800]  Republicans that if you don't help me I'll get these guys to do it and he does
[3:42:03.800 --> 3:42:09.520]  seem to be getting the Republicans angry with what he's doing another thing
[3:42:09.520 --> 3:42:14.600]  is yeah if you invite a Schumer and Pelosi in you're gonna get some
[3:42:14.600 --> 3:42:20.680]  Democratic support they're not gonna rag you as badly if you have the two big
[3:42:20.680 --> 3:42:29.120]  wigs having dinner with Donald at the White House so I never profess to know
[3:42:29.120 --> 3:42:35.480]  what this guy's up to and I did vote for him just to really throw a monkey wrench
[3:42:35.480 --> 3:42:43.760]  into the works over there in Washington DC and and it worked oh did it work they
[3:42:43.760 --> 3:42:47.920]  they still don't know what to do with them they don't know how to handle them
[3:42:47.920 --> 3:42:52.280]  and like I said he seems to be five steps ahead of everybody so it is
[3:42:52.280 --> 3:42:59.100]  interesting to watch but I would like to see him be a little tougher on things
[3:42:59.100 --> 3:43:07.560]  like DACA and the border wall they should have if they're working out a
[3:43:07.560 --> 3:43:14.120]  deal with Pelosi and Schumer about immigration and DACA is part of what
[3:43:14.120 --> 3:43:18.520]  they were talking about I do think that the wall should have come up in
[3:43:18.520 --> 3:43:26.160]  conversation I think stronger border security more border guards would have
[3:43:26.160 --> 3:43:31.280]  been awesome but for some reason that didn't come up and that's disappointing
[3:43:31.280 --> 3:43:37.560]  but again I would never profess to know what goes on in the mind of Donald
[3:43:37.560 --> 3:43:45.120]  Trump well the I was talking to Alex when I first came on about the amazing
[3:43:45.120 --> 3:43:54.040]  state of Texas Hurricane Harvey blasted through Houston a few other cities in
[3:43:54.040 --> 3:44:01.080]  in Texas and man Texas never disappoints that that state just came to the
[3:44:01.080 --> 3:44:06.480]  table for themselves and for each other there there there was there were people
[3:44:06.480 --> 3:44:13.320]  that absolutely needed to be rescued but a lot of people they they stuck it out
[3:44:13.320 --> 3:44:18.040]  they they were able to take care of themselves take care of their loved
[3:44:18.040 --> 3:44:23.200]  ones and their neighbors getting in a boat helping out your your fellow man
[3:44:23.200 --> 3:44:31.600]  it was amazing to watch Texas in in action like that and it does show that
[3:44:31.600 --> 3:44:37.480]  man there still are some strong willed people that are able to take care of
[3:44:37.480 --> 3:44:43.640]  themselves in this country real men real women that still know their their
[3:44:43.640 --> 3:44:49.120]  roles in life and it was it was refreshing to watch because every day
[3:44:49.120 --> 3:45:01.840]  we're fed this garbage of beta males butch women you watch TV all you see are
[3:45:01.840 --> 3:45:12.120]  these defeated man women or women men being pushed around and bossed around
[3:45:12.120 --> 3:45:19.860]  and it was refreshing to see real guys facing a challenge and and coming to the
[3:45:19.860 --> 3:45:25.880]  table this this indoctrination we're seeing on college campuses and on
[3:45:25.880 --> 3:45:33.560]  mainstream media television the biggest criminal in all this I believe are TV
[3:45:33.560 --> 3:45:41.800]  commercials I am stunned on a daily basis what I see on commercials that are
[3:45:41.800 --> 3:45:48.280]  just brainwashing people into believing that if you're a straight white male you
[3:45:48.280 --> 3:45:53.720]  are incapable of anything there's one commercial for an insurance company that
[3:45:53.720 --> 3:46:01.280]  I love where the guy suggests to his significant other his wife or what have
[3:46:01.280 --> 3:46:11.120]  you that he could fix a leaky pipe and she just yells no no and he's like oh
[3:46:11.120 --> 3:46:17.840]  okay okay dear and and you're like what but yeah there there there he is there
[3:46:17.840 --> 3:46:24.440]  he is just a dope staring at a pipe and his wife is like no oh he's like I could
[3:46:24.440 --> 3:46:30.760]  do that and she yells from the kitchen no oh and he's like oh okay dear all right
[3:46:30.760 --> 3:46:37.720]  dearie and that's the image that's the image we're getting of men of American
[3:46:37.720 --> 3:46:46.400]  men and it's it's purposeful people don't I get because I get it all the time
[3:46:46.400 --> 3:46:51.600]  really really Anthony is that what they're doing yes that's what they're
[3:46:51.600 --> 3:46:58.480]  doing because it it goes on it's every single spot you cannot see a guy that's
[3:46:58.480 --> 3:47:03.960]  capable of doing anything the woman's got a swoop in and knock him down or or do
[3:47:03.960 --> 3:47:11.760]  it herself and leave him looking like an idiot just basic things that men used
[3:47:11.760 --> 3:47:20.360]  to do are literally illegal now you go to the workplace and try to try to fire
[3:47:20.360 --> 3:47:24.560]  up a little conversation with a co-worker of the opposite sex what is
[3:47:24.560 --> 3:47:29.920]  the opposite sex now anyway there's 27 of them I think 27 I always thought it
[3:47:29.920 --> 3:47:36.040]  was xxxy and that's pretty much it as far as chromosomes and concern but 27
[3:47:36.040 --> 3:47:40.160]  different sexes but if you want to start up a conversation with a woman at
[3:47:40.160 --> 3:47:46.560]  work you best have another job lined up because you absolutely could lose your
[3:47:46.560 --> 3:47:53.080]  job over it but this was stuff that just men and women used to do Alex and
[3:47:53.080 --> 3:47:59.600]  myself were just talking about that the the dance the age of the timeless dance
[3:47:59.600 --> 3:48:05.240]  of romance that used to be a thing when you had to face a person of the
[3:48:05.240 --> 3:48:10.040]  opposite sex face-to-face and start up a conversation and hope she found it
[3:48:10.040 --> 3:48:14.720]  interesting enough to stick around and perhaps you would get a date out of it
[3:48:14.720 --> 3:48:22.720]  and see where that leads at work now just saying you you look nice today like
[3:48:22.720 --> 3:48:28.760]  your hair that's a pretty dress could literally get you fired there goes your
[3:48:28.760 --> 3:48:36.160]  reputation there goes and and all that is all that used to be was being a a man
[3:48:36.160 --> 3:48:43.440]  but again we we're not allowed to do that I actually yesterday I was doing the
[3:48:43.440 --> 3:48:50.200]  Kennedy show on Fox News and Kennedy was wearing a nice dress with roses on it
[3:48:50.200 --> 3:48:57.520]  it was a figure forming and right there in the studio I said Kennedy that's a
[3:48:57.520 --> 3:49:06.120]  cute dress and I actually thought in my head oh what did I just say I second
[3:49:06.120 --> 3:49:15.920]  guest a compliment to a woman that her dress was pretty oh I said cute I went
[3:49:15.920 --> 3:49:21.920]  over every word in my head was cute the right thing to say she's a woman that
[3:49:21.920 --> 3:49:29.080]  might infer or imply that she's a girl they don't like that so we're we're
[3:49:29.080 --> 3:49:33.280]  really all of us even the people that are aware are so brainwashed and
[3:49:33.280 --> 3:49:41.440]  conditioned that we are not acting like men anymore and it's it's sad it's very
[3:49:41.440 --> 3:49:48.120]  sad Hillary Clinton isn't helping though I gotta talk to about this when we got
[3:49:48.120 --> 3:49:55.640]  back she's continuing her it wasn't me tour she's she's on all the talk shows
[3:49:55.640 --> 3:50:00.920]  all the hard-hitting talk shows that really give her a lot of guff like the
[3:50:00.920 --> 3:50:06.400]  today show in the view you want to talk about throwing softballs at this this
[3:50:06.400 --> 3:50:13.680]  woman she she's been on blaming everything for her loss of the
[3:50:13.680 --> 3:50:18.080]  presidential election what did she blame yesterday just yesterday a blue
[3:50:18.080 --> 3:50:24.520]  breasted a whipper will she then blamed a rhododendron and then a rake she
[3:50:24.520 --> 3:50:31.080]  actually blamed a rake for her loss she's really running out of things to
[3:50:31.080 --> 3:50:34.840]  blame but we'll talk about how I believe Hillary is one of the most
[3:50:34.840 --> 3:50:40.240]  detrimental things to ever happen to American women we'll be back in a matter
[3:50:40.240 --> 3:50:46.760]  of moments oh we're skipping a break hey thanks and I'll just keep going on I was
[3:50:46.760 --> 3:50:50.760]  ready to do one of those professional breaks we'll just keep going my friends
[3:50:50.760 --> 3:50:54.560]  yeah Hillary Clinton is absolutely one of the most detrimental things to
[3:50:54.560 --> 3:51:04.640]  American women she talks about misogyny misogyny this hatred of women as one of
[3:51:04.640 --> 3:51:13.640]  the reasons she lost the election and then she goes on every show she's able
[3:51:13.640 --> 3:51:25.200]  to get on and talks about being a victim she throws the I'm a woman I'm a weak
[3:51:25.200 --> 3:51:35.440]  victim card right out on the table and then blames men for not voting for her
[3:51:35.440 --> 3:51:42.040]  because she's a woman and then acts like a stereotypical woman that we would all
[3:51:42.040 --> 3:51:50.840]  think wasn't wasn't very strong she was on the view and just you know their
[3:51:50.840 --> 3:51:55.800]  advertisement for it before she came on was that they're gonna gonna ask her
[3:51:55.800 --> 3:52:03.640]  some some tough questions look out and it was all just softballs about her book
[3:52:03.640 --> 3:52:12.240]  her book what happened a question or a statement why would you even call your
[3:52:12.240 --> 3:52:19.480]  book that when we all know what happened you were a lousy candidate just
[3:52:19.480 --> 3:52:26.720]  embroiled in investigations and controversy since we heard their names
[3:52:26.720 --> 3:52:33.400]  since we heard who the Clintons even were that's when it started and the
[3:52:33.400 --> 3:52:43.080]  clock has been ticking on their crooked degenerate lives ever since and she
[3:52:43.080 --> 3:52:50.160]  wonders what happened and she wants to tell tell everybody what happened well
[3:52:50.160 --> 3:52:57.280]  she's blamed Donald Trump of course and then she blamed Bernie Sanders the
[3:52:57.280 --> 3:53:05.280]  person that they screwed out of the Democratic nomination and the primaries
[3:53:05.280 --> 3:53:14.240]  by by handing Hillary's team debate questions and coming up with their
[3:53:14.240 --> 3:53:20.000]  their super delegates and all the other things that screwed Bernie out of the
[3:53:20.000 --> 3:53:28.920]  nomination she is blaming him now don't get me wrong I no love here for Mr.
[3:53:28.920 --> 3:53:38.600]  Bernie Sanders but the can I say the balls the balls to to to blame the guy
[3:53:38.600 --> 3:53:49.280]  you screwed over in the primary this woman has not an ounce of dignity or
[3:53:49.280 --> 3:53:57.320]  humanity in her I honestly believe that for whoever's left down there in
[3:53:57.320 --> 3:54:05.760]  Guantanamo get the audio version of what happened by Hillary Rodham Clinton and
[3:54:05.760 --> 3:54:10.200]  just blasted through a bullhorn just blasted through speakers in the cell
[3:54:10.200 --> 3:54:18.040]  blocks that all the Gitmo detainees are living in because they will crack in a
[3:54:18.040 --> 3:54:28.080]  second I have never heard anyone so robotic as Hillary Rodham Clinton but
[3:54:28.080 --> 3:54:34.680]  yeah again there there she goes continuing her it wasn't me it was
[3:54:34.680 --> 3:54:41.320]  everything else tour and I welcome it because come the midterm elections we
[3:54:41.320 --> 3:54:47.040]  are gonna want to see her face as much as is humanly possible because she is
[3:54:47.040 --> 3:54:52.800]  just the biggest turnoff her Pelosi Schumer I want to say I want to see them
[3:54:52.800 --> 3:55:02.520]  all finally I quickly want to say where you cannot give radicals an inch you
[3:55:02.520 --> 3:55:07.560]  can't give them an inch racist anthem that's what was spray painted on the
[3:55:07.560 --> 3:55:12.000]  hundred and six year old Francis Scott key statue in Baltimore here's the guy
[3:55:12.000 --> 3:55:17.960]  that wrote the national anthem and it's all part of the deconstruction of
[3:55:17.960 --> 3:55:25.760]  America this ripping down monuments and changing history it's all part of
[3:55:25.760 --> 3:55:33.720]  deconstructing traditional conservative values here in the United States you
[3:55:33.720 --> 3:55:43.240]  give a radical an inch and they will take a mile and this is absolute it has
[3:55:43.240 --> 3:55:49.080]  happened before in history I don't know why we don't learn from it it all
[3:55:49.080 --> 3:55:56.760]  started with one of the most vile vile things I've ever personally seen the
[3:55:56.760 --> 3:56:04.080]  roof of the General Lee the car from the dukes of hazard yes folks if you
[3:56:04.080 --> 3:56:10.840]  remember couple years back the dreaded General Lee the car from the goofy dukes
[3:56:10.840 --> 3:56:15.640]  a hazard show was banned from everywhere because it had a Confederate flag on the
[3:56:15.640 --> 3:56:24.320]  roof and was named General Lee so it's been removed you cannot find the dukes
[3:56:24.320 --> 3:56:32.680]  of hazard on television that's the sacrifice that we all made to better
[3:56:32.680 --> 3:56:40.640]  race relations in the horribly racist United States did everyone go away no
[3:56:40.640 --> 3:56:46.160]  they wanted the Confederate flag removed from everywhere and as you see
[3:56:46.160 --> 3:56:51.880]  they've done a pretty damn good job of it when that happened did they go away
[3:56:51.880 --> 3:56:58.440]  they go to the next thing and the next thing until the jokes that were being
[3:56:58.440 --> 3:57:04.040]  made about Jefferson and Washington monuments being taken down aren't jokes
[3:57:04.040 --> 3:57:11.040]  anymore they're not jokes they are actually asking for all of these statues
[3:57:11.040 --> 3:57:17.400]  and monuments and names of buildings and whatnot to be removed removed because
[3:57:17.400 --> 3:57:26.640]  they're offensive because back when slavery was actually legal people had
[3:57:26.640 --> 3:57:33.440]  slaves and I guess that's a bad thing because we're judging people from over
[3:57:33.440 --> 3:57:40.880]  200 years ago with the values of 2017 which is always good to do you might as
[3:57:40.880 --> 3:57:47.640]  well knock down every single building every monument and rename rename everything
[3:57:47.640 --> 3:57:54.320]  because that everyone had their faults everyone had their sins at some point in
[3:57:54.320 --> 3:58:01.840]  history so I don't know what to tell these people they won't stop it is
[3:58:01.840 --> 3:58:07.640]  deconstructing the traditional values of this country I want to thank Alex Jones
[3:58:07.640 --> 3:58:11.720]  and everyone at info wars.com I'm Anthony Kumiya you can find me on
[3:58:11.720 --> 3:58:17.080]  compoundmedia.com thanks again and we'll see you in a couple of weeks
[3:58:17.080 --> 3:58:39.240]  I'll be back there.
