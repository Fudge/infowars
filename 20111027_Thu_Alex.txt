[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.600 --> 00:19.140]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.140 --> 00:39.580]  Texas Alex Jones it is Thursday the 27th day of October 2011 we're gonna be
[00:39.580 --> 00:43.880]  live here for the next three hours and I'll be back tonight 7 o'clock central
[00:43.880 --> 00:49.300]  within full wars nightly news all right I want to go over some of the news and
[00:49.300 --> 00:56.260]  then I want to go to your phone calls for the entire transmission except for
[00:56.260 --> 01:01.740]  the last half of the second hour since he's over in Europe and since he is an
[01:01.740 --> 01:08.220]  economist and well great financial brain we're gonna have Max Kaiser popping
[01:08.220 --> 01:14.580]  in with us to talk about the supposed debt agreement and I spent a lot of
[01:14.580 --> 01:17.700]  time last night this morning trying to figure out what's in it and it looks
[01:17.700 --> 01:21.460]  like a classic globalist operation kind of like the Copenhagen Treaty where they
[01:21.460 --> 01:25.260]  wouldn't let anybody see the Copenhagen Treaty they told people what was in it
[01:25.260 --> 01:30.500]  or five years ago Bush said this bill is not an amnesty but we don't want to be
[01:30.500 --> 01:35.300]  public and then senator Sessions made it public and it was more than amnesty it
[01:35.300 --> 01:41.540]  actually legalized felons violent felons aggravated felons so I guess in a
[01:41.540 --> 01:45.740]  way it wasn't amnesty it was it was a pardon and then an amnesty kind of a
[01:45.740 --> 01:54.060]  amnesty with a cherry on top of it and going over the debates in the German
[01:54.060 --> 01:57.660]  government German parliament and the Greek parliament and others we got some
[01:57.660 --> 02:02.140]  glimpses of what they were reading and it was this is backed up by German pension
[02:02.140 --> 02:11.860]  insurance this is wrong and but but now they're reporting today they are
[02:11.860 --> 02:25.460]  reporting that there is a 50 percent haircut on the bonds that investors had
[02:25.460 --> 02:32.940]  bought that were all tied in with derivatives other fraudulent things so
[02:32.940 --> 02:37.060]  what's happening is they're not fully bailing out investors you're going to
[02:37.060 --> 02:42.020]  wait a minute how is that a Greek debt crisis the government just signed on to
[02:42.020 --> 02:50.140]  that you see so you are getting glimmers here we'll go over these articles we are
[02:50.140 --> 02:58.300]  getting glimmers in all of this of exactly what's going on here and that
[02:58.300 --> 03:02.660]  again just like in Iceland and other countries where they've dug into it the
[03:02.660 --> 03:08.060]  vast majority of what we've been forced to sign on to whether it's the U.S.
[03:08.060 --> 03:14.780]  Ireland Greece Iceland the list goes on and on is not owed by the people we're
[03:14.780 --> 03:21.380]  told gotta raise taxes gotta cut your benefits gotta do all this why why big
[03:21.380 --> 03:24.980]  government socialism doesn't work and I agree it doesn't because it always
[03:24.980 --> 03:29.780]  creates this domestication and then they pool our money and rob it some of the
[03:29.780 --> 03:33.100]  poor Occupy Wall Street people in the that are calling for collectivism
[03:33.100 --> 03:37.260]  calling for higher taxes they don't get it you'll never get your hands on
[03:37.260 --> 03:42.580]  anything but chicken feed and any chicken feed you are given is only because it
[03:42.580 --> 03:47.300]  builds up a debt so that the system can have you dependent and I know this is
[03:47.300 --> 03:51.500]  understood by most people who live in the real world and didn't just grow up
[03:51.500 --> 03:55.540]  with mommy and daddy with a silver spoon in their mouth and some middle-class
[03:55.540 --> 03:59.740]  neighborhood and that is a silver spoon compared to most people in the world and
[03:59.740 --> 04:03.860]  then you mommy and daddy pay for your college and you go get drunk for four
[04:03.860 --> 04:09.340]  years and then you get out and and now you want a job but there aren't any
[04:09.340 --> 04:13.500]  really high-paying ones left because of globalism and the industrialization and
[04:13.500 --> 04:18.940]  so you go to the government you say raise taxes on the rich people so I can
[04:18.940 --> 04:25.540]  have a job there aren't any jobs because of big government because of
[04:25.540 --> 04:32.260]  globalism it's wrecked the country that's why there aren't jobs for you with
[04:32.260 --> 04:38.420]  your degree because they shipped our jobs offshore with tax incentives because
[04:38.420 --> 04:42.460]  they put red tape all over everything here because the globalists own the
[04:42.460 --> 04:46.300]  factories in China and Mexico and India and wanted to move it out of here and
[04:46.300 --> 04:52.860]  Eastern Europe and Africa and Asia that's why you don't have a job there's
[04:52.860 --> 04:58.220]  nothing left to tax the bankers are offshore I'm all for taking their wealth
[04:58.220 --> 05:04.740]  away they stole it when you're out on the road the last place you want to be is
[05:04.740 --> 05:10.920]  on the road but if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing

[08:25.100 --> 08:31.100]  and awaken humanity out of their deep hypnotic trance to the tyranny the
[08:31.100 --> 08:38.780]  scientific methodical admitted public world scientific dictatorship being
[08:38.780 --> 08:45.340]  established now in its final phases of construction to use a Star Wars analogy
[08:45.340 --> 08:51.860]  the Death Star is almost completed and about to be cleared to fire and we have
[08:51.860 --> 08:56.900]  got to do something about it so the X wings are scrambled and are going in
[08:56.900 --> 09:04.780]  because we don't have a choice by the way I saw an article today up on info
[09:04.780 --> 09:11.780]  wars calm that I do want to go over a little bit later because it's just an
[09:11.780 --> 09:16.740]  amazing compilation of globalist quotes about how they're going to set up a
[09:16.740 --> 09:20.820]  world government and kill the majority of the population and how the UN is
[09:20.820 --> 09:26.260]  freaking out over 7 million people and fear mongering right now of course they
[09:26.260 --> 09:30.260]  never want their resources cut off they want to cut yours off or jack up your
[09:30.260 --> 09:38.540]  taxes and and pay it pay it to themselves let me just let me just do
[09:38.540 --> 09:44.140]  this now let me just go over the news and then I'm going to open the phones up
[09:44.140 --> 09:48.540]  Max Kaiser will be joining us at the bottom of the next hour for 30 minutes
[09:48.540 --> 09:53.780]  or two segments to go over exactly what's happening with the EU deal and
[09:53.780 --> 09:59.780]  are they really gonna have a 50% haircut quote on the face value of investor
[09:59.780 --> 10:08.340]  bonds again the Greek government has signed on to guarantee the banks bad
[10:08.340 --> 10:13.100]  derivatives and the bad bonds that have been issued and and tied into the
[10:13.100 --> 10:17.860]  government so there's little admissions here hiding in plain view of what this
[10:17.860 --> 10:22.340]  is really all about and that's good I'm glad this should have happened with our
[10:22.340 --> 10:29.140]  banker bailout a total haircut see I don't need another haircut I don't need
[10:29.140 --> 10:35.620]  I don't I'm not in the stock market I don't own derivatives I know it's a big
[10:35.620 --> 10:44.940]  casino and totally rigged 100% rigged totally and completely rigged just like
[10:44.940 --> 10:48.780]  the slot machines of the casino we're all computer hooked up tracking how long
[10:48.780 --> 10:54.700]  you've been sitting there there's a wait on the seat to know scientifically with
[10:54.700 --> 10:58.060]  algorithms when the average person's about to quit they give you a few coins
[10:58.060 --> 11:04.780]  I mean it's like a chicken pecking at a light to get a few pieces of grain and I
[11:04.780 --> 11:10.500]  shouldn't have to pay money to Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and AIG and all
[11:10.500 --> 11:17.580]  these people but they they they blur the lines and say the Greek debt the Irish
[11:17.580 --> 11:24.020]  debt the Icelandic debt the Icelanders are the only people to say no to this
[11:24.020 --> 11:28.340]  after year and a half of protest and we should get Burkita Jones daughter year
[11:28.340 --> 11:31.060]  back on member of parliament over there who helped lead the fight against them
[11:31.060 --> 11:37.420]  it's only like 400,000 people total over there I think like 350,000 I'm living
[11:37.420 --> 11:44.220]  an Iraqi effect but but the point is that when they finally fired the finance
[11:44.220 --> 11:52.220]  ministry and got into the documents 90 was it 92% 90 plus percent was owed by
[11:52.220 --> 11:56.420]  the banks themselves that were private to just you with the government
[11:56.420 --> 12:02.580]  ministers saying the people owed it and so that's what this is all about and I
[12:02.580 --> 12:06.740]  want to explain something conservatively we're talking about 1.5
[12:06.740 --> 12:10.860]  quadrillion dollars there 1,500 trillion that's already been leveraged again so
[12:10.860 --> 12:16.540]  who knows what it is for all intents and purposes it's infinity so even if we
[12:16.540 --> 12:20.540]  wanted to pay all this off that isn't our debt we can't pay it off but we're
[12:20.540 --> 12:24.740]  told the global economy will be imploded world depression European
[12:24.740 --> 12:33.260]  depression if you don't shine on to all of this but it's impossible to to to
[12:33.260 --> 12:40.140]  triage you just got to get rid of it all you can't pick and choose it's all done
[12:40.140 --> 12:44.460]  it's all fraudulent it's all infected and the globalist plan was take up with
[12:44.460 --> 12:48.180]  the world financially through fraud on the front end of the Ponzi scheme going
[12:48.180 --> 12:52.180]  up to the top of the pyramid now that you're going down the slope into
[12:52.180 --> 12:55.940]  oblivion they're there holding everybody hostage saying give us more
[12:55.940 --> 12:59.820]  power give us more bailouts give us more power wave your national sovereignty
[12:59.820 --> 13:03.100]  completely to the euro you'll never be able to get out again we're going to
[13:03.100 --> 13:07.180]  have taxes on space heaters and on every toilet flush that's in the news today
[13:07.180 --> 13:13.220]  and on rainwater and on electricity and on everything you do the taxes will be
[13:13.220 --> 13:18.500]  over 80% to pay off the debt you owe it you owe it it's these bad welfare moms
[13:18.500 --> 13:22.740]  they bankrupted us well I don't particularly like the surly welfare mom
[13:22.740 --> 13:26.420]  on average who tends to think the government that gives her a check is
[13:26.420 --> 13:31.740]  sweet and wants my guns and wants my private property and is is is is ignorant
[13:31.740 --> 13:37.300]  but they're just a cannon fodder weapon who mean well they're more like a
[13:37.300 --> 13:41.940]  zombie a human wave attack we have to deal with those of us that are aware and
[13:41.940 --> 13:47.860]  they're a very small part of the of this banquet table of our stolen goods
[13:47.860 --> 13:54.500]  taken to us at the barrel of a gun for all these ideas you know million dollar
[13:54.500 --> 13:57.860]  shrimp on a treadmill study every time I say that I get emails saying I'm making
[13:57.860 --> 14:01.500]  it up just Google shrimp on a treadmill study you'll get ABC you name it
[14:01.500 --> 14:07.020]  millions I forget how many millions for shrimp on treadmill the the point is or
[14:07.020 --> 14:13.140]  or or it's not about the State Department spending $70,000 here $30,000 there
[14:13.140 --> 14:18.580]  huh you know on buying Barack Obama books your tax money to buy Barack Obama
[14:18.580 --> 14:24.860]  books totally illegal but they're just doing it totally illegal to give half
[14:24.860 --> 14:30.700]  billion and billion dollar goodie grants to the to their campaign
[14:30.700 --> 14:33.980]  contributors you give Obama a couple hundred thousand dollars you get about
[14:33.980 --> 14:39.860]  500 million back pretty good deal and and we wonder why we can't have jobs we
[14:39.860 --> 14:42.780]  wonder why the standard of living is dropping we wonder why the roads are
[14:42.780 --> 14:47.020]  rotting we wonder why they're laying off police all over the country but then
[14:47.020 --> 14:50.900]  saying oh but the officers that are left are gonna revenue generate and not
[14:50.900 --> 14:57.940]  respond to all these crimes the taxes go up you get less services that's what it
[14:57.940 --> 15:02.540]  is to be gang raped by the new world order financially and they're setting
[15:02.540 --> 15:05.980]  up the domestic checkpoints now and having major newspapers that we've
[15:05.980 --> 15:10.260]  covered on Monday come out and say you don't have a right to not be searched on
[15:10.260 --> 15:15.060]  the highway everybody knows in cultures for thousands of years checkpoints or
[15:15.060 --> 15:18.340]  when occupied countries under everybody knows it's illegal in the US
[15:18.340 --> 15:21.620]  everybody knows that's what goes on in third world countries everybody knows
[15:21.620 --> 15:26.660]  that's what happens in Mexico but they sit there with a straight face in fact
[15:26.660 --> 15:29.620]  I'm gonna get to this in the third hour today I didn't get to it yesterday because
[15:29.620 --> 15:34.100]  I had so much news to cover but I will play three or four minutes of my
[15:34.100 --> 15:37.740]  encounter with a TSA it actually went on for about 10 but they'd have me stand
[15:37.740 --> 15:45.340]  there for a while so there's no audio so we just cut those those spaces out and
[15:45.340 --> 15:49.140]  what happened I'm gonna get in my Las Vegas trip some two in the last 30
[15:49.140 --> 15:53.580]  minutes of the show just just the just the police state weirdness of it the
[15:53.580 --> 15:59.260]  decadence the porn blowing in the streets like some dystopic and again it
[15:59.260 --> 16:03.520]  isn't that ooh the porn shocks me I can't handle looking at images of naked
[16:03.520 --> 16:09.340]  women that's how the world sells it that that those of us that are concerned
[16:09.340 --> 16:16.740]  about pornography are are are are not lovers of life the lover of life's not
[16:16.740 --> 16:24.780]  the sinner you know they show you the idea that that it's that people are
[16:24.780 --> 16:29.460]  prudes because they can't handle something no all the studies show with
[16:29.460 --> 16:38.940]  porn that it actually doesn't then let you enjoy the real thing and it actually
[16:38.940 --> 16:45.060]  reduces the amount of actual real sexual activity that's what the globalist said
[16:45.060 --> 16:49.580]  50 years ago I've read the think tank reports here on air
[16:49.580 --> 16:55.580]  since some of the expanded extras of in-game we put on prisonplanet.tv we
[16:55.580 --> 16:59.340]  talked to dr. Kaufman and others he was going over how they said we'll get the
[16:59.340 --> 17:02.980]  public on prescription drugs prozac all that stuff this was before they called
[17:02.980 --> 17:06.900]  it prozac but it was fluoride based weapon systems they they even described
[17:06.900 --> 17:11.580]  that they also want to destroy your brain while they're you know I mean you're
[17:11.580 --> 17:15.980]  high because it's killing brain cells it's like liquor but hits different
[17:15.980 --> 17:21.860]  areas and they said and we'll have porn everywhere so that so that people are
[17:21.860 --> 17:25.780]  satiated by that but also if they do get a mate they'll tend to leave them
[17:25.780 --> 17:33.660]  because then it makes them not satisfied by that you know it's the old joke of
[17:33.660 --> 17:39.260]  back in college when I would get drugged to a topless bar a gentleman's club and
[17:39.260 --> 17:45.780]  I didn't ever particularly like him because I don't like being hustled I mean
[17:45.780 --> 17:50.620]  I'm attracted to was the waitress at a diner who was sweet and nice and
[17:50.620 --> 17:56.500]  feminine and friendly it wasn't even so much sex I mean I like an enchanting
[17:56.500 --> 18:02.020]  woman I like a friendly neat smart but also beautiful that's always nice but
[18:02.020 --> 18:06.180]  but the beauty is different it varies but it's always I mean a well-known joke

[26:24.060 --> 26:28.780]  introduced in US House here's Paul Watson's article that details the whole
[26:28.780 --> 26:31.940]  history of it they want the full spectrum analysis rogue website bill
[26:31.940 --> 26:36.660]  creates Chinese style ban list shame when they tried to pass on Australia two
[26:36.660 --> 26:41.060]  years ago and in the in the beta test they said we're testing it for six months

[26:50.900 --> 26:55.940]  from RT US cops tried to erase online evidence of brutality yeah there's
[26:55.940 --> 27:00.060]  hundreds of thousands of government takedown orders in the Google
[27:00.060 --> 27:03.620]  transparency report they've put out Watson was the first to dig through it
[27:03.620 --> 27:09.580]  and find the part where the government said these are videos critical of the
[27:09.580 --> 27:20.180]  US government remove them critical of the US government remove them and of
[27:20.180 --> 27:24.100]  course they really cover stuff up with their community guidelines report we've
[27:24.100 --> 27:27.060]  had them do that with our videos where there's nothing but us speaking about
[27:27.060 --> 27:32.820]  news on it and the videos are removed Google has been asked by US law
[27:32.820 --> 27:35.980]  enforcement agency to remove several videos frozen police brutality from the
[27:35.980 --> 27:39.500]  video sharing service YouTube the company has revealed in its latest update
[27:39.500 --> 27:45.340]  to an online transparency report of course there's our report yesterday that
[27:45.340 --> 27:49.460]  that quite frankly has gotten no attention I was the exact headline on that
[27:49.460 --> 27:58.100]  it was federal government told YouTube to take down videos federal government
[27:58.100 --> 28:02.140]  told YouTube to take down videos that were critical of government I want to
[28:02.140 --> 28:06.940]  reprint that or I can go in this last night stack and repull it but but but
[28:06.940 --> 28:13.420]  it's big it's really really big coming up after we take some calls I want to get
[28:13.420 --> 28:17.800]  into this article from the American dream up at info wars.com from seven
[28:17.800 --> 28:21.820]  billion people to 500 million people the sick population control agenda of the
[28:21.820 --> 28:30.580]  global elite and the United Nations is is out freaking out right now they've
[28:30.580 --> 28:34.420]  been running around freaking out that it reached seven billion people and they
[28:34.420 --> 28:37.620]  say it's unsustainable then reduce it down to 500 million that's been their
[28:37.620 --> 28:44.260]  official number for decades and it's got quite a few quotes in here I want to go
[28:44.260 --> 28:51.460]  over later how they want to reduce our population so that is just some of what
[28:51.460 --> 28:56.220]  we're going to be getting to over in that stack of news that's that's part of
[28:56.220 --> 29:04.420]  one stack there's one two three four five six seven eight nine ten let's continue

[32:09.900 --> 32:14.220]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I've turned
[32:14.220 --> 32:19.060]  members influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[32:19.060 --> 32:24.420]  shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[32:24.420 --> 32:29.300]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-short
[32:29.300 --> 32:34.020]  cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[32:34.020 --> 32:38.060]  world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more

[33:00.260 --> 33:16.260]  Defending the Republic from enemies born in domestic it's Alex Jones
[33:16.260 --> 33:22.900]  all right we are back live I want to get into flying Humvees the Pentagon is
[33:22.900 --> 33:27.300]  coming out with I guess these will be manned most of the military is moving
[33:27.300 --> 33:31.300]  to unmanned so the globalists can just control it themselves they already have
[33:31.300 --> 33:39.740]  autonomous drones in the sky now that a robot controlled not human controlled but
[33:39.740 --> 33:46.260]  the biggest growth area in the Air Force right now is just the regular folks
[33:46.260 --> 33:53.620]  that used to service the B-1 bombers the the F-16s the the people that fueled
[33:53.620 --> 33:58.940]  them put the bombs on them they are now training to actually pilot the drones
[33:58.940 --> 34:04.180]  it's just a massive expansion as we said for many years by 2012 the Air Force
[34:04.180 --> 34:10.700]  wanted half of its force to be drone and they're online to do that and by 2025
[34:10.700 --> 34:15.700]  almost the entire force they may still just vestigially have like a captain on
[34:15.700 --> 34:19.780]  the airline you fly on who you know is there just in case there's a thing kind
[34:19.780 --> 34:23.220]  of like an attendant and I guess they'll end up being a ceremonial position in
[34:23.220 --> 34:26.900]  the future where the captain gets you drinks or whatever you know brings you
[34:26.900 --> 34:31.540]  a bag of peanuts I guess the captain will be the flight attendant because
[34:31.540 --> 34:36.140]  that's basically where this is going and it takes humanity completely out of
[34:36.140 --> 34:40.420]  the equation and also kills the development of human skills just as the
[34:40.420 --> 34:45.420]  calculator has destroyed people's basic mathematics skills that's just what's
[34:45.420 --> 34:50.540]  used in school again all of this stuff is a double-edged sword I go out to eat
[34:50.540 --> 34:55.060]  now and notice that most people around me aren't talking their own smartphones
[34:55.060 --> 35:00.180]  and I even catch myself doing it myself though I'm getting work done I'm sure
[35:00.180 --> 35:03.140]  they're getting work done to the point is it's changing the culture they should
[35:03.140 --> 35:06.460]  have studied out this year showing in the last five a massive drop in the
[35:06.460 --> 35:13.660]  vocabulary of young people and some even unable to speak now and when they do
[35:13.660 --> 35:21.020]  speak its its you know best friend ever abbreviations and K I see adults say K
[35:21.020 --> 35:26.380]  to me again this is the destruction of the ancient English language which is a
[35:26.380 --> 35:30.420]  fusion of more than eight different languages the greatest language ever
[35:30.420 --> 35:36.780]  because it is a hybrid Mongol language it is it is it is a hind 57 and it's just
[35:36.780 --> 35:40.500]  total destruction the French language is being destroyed cultures being
[35:40.500 --> 35:44.660]  destroyed we are being destroyed our women are being destroyed our DNA is
[35:44.660 --> 35:49.380]  being destroyed our financial systems are being destroyed our health is being
[35:49.380 --> 35:54.540]  destroyed this is the wages of the New World Order is a society completely
[35:54.540 --> 36:01.780]  degenerating and again it's done by design the way of entropy is easier and
[36:01.780 --> 36:07.740]  it's where the globalists want us so they go with the chaos alright I'm I'm
[36:07.740 --> 36:12.900]  ranting here I want to open the phones up but but every once in a while I
[36:12.900 --> 36:18.180]  specifically want you to to to give me your take on a specific subject now we
[36:18.180 --> 36:21.660]  don't screen your calls so people you know only do this maybe five six times a
[36:21.660 --> 36:27.940]  year they pretty much refuse always to even talk about the subject I'm raising
[36:27.940 --> 36:31.180]  so if I go to you and you bring up something else I'm gonna have to let
[36:31.180 --> 36:35.540]  you go okay because I specifically want to hear from you on this where do you
[36:35.540 --> 36:40.100]  think the world's going in the next couple years how bad is this depression
[36:40.100 --> 36:45.020]  going to get will people fully wake up what most concerns you about stage care
[36:45.020 --> 36:50.300]  biochemical radiological what other tricks are the globalists have I mean
[36:50.300 --> 36:55.220]  it's a wide-ranging question and and it's the paramount question I mean do
[36:55.220 --> 36:59.340]  you feel everybody I talked to says they can feel the tension rising like
[36:59.340 --> 37:03.100]  never before in their lives that this moment in history we've entered is an
[37:03.100 --> 37:11.620]  absolutely critical juncture crossroads jump point flash point into the future
[37:11.620 --> 37:18.620]  that the that the future destiny of humanity is now being decided and if
[37:18.620 --> 37:23.340]  you think the quickening is great now it is only a prelude to what's going to
[37:23.340 --> 37:28.380]  come in sheltered America where it can't happen we thought we see the
[37:28.380 --> 37:35.060]  classical forms of wicked police state rapidly raging and and and and just
[37:35.060 --> 37:40.780]  metastasizing and we see the high-tech grids the the the hidden surveillance
[37:40.780 --> 37:45.940]  pods and the street lights and the citizen tattletales and anywhere I go
[37:45.940 --> 37:51.300]  in the US you're standing on a street corner talking to a friend with a video
[37:51.300 --> 37:55.260]  camera even a little one private security cards come over with pleasure
[37:55.260 --> 37:58.980]  until you get out of here this is private and then you have to tell them no
[37:58.980 --> 38:03.180]  this is no perception of this being private even if you claim the sidewalk
[38:03.180 --> 38:09.060]  is owned by somebody and I go ahead and call the police and you may false your
[38:09.060 --> 38:12.300]  recipe but I'm gonna sue you personally and then they scurry off and say who
[38:12.300 --> 38:17.820]  are you that actually happened when I was in Vegas I may play that video but
[38:17.820 --> 38:23.220]  the point is it's all about pecking you on the head if you're not wandering
[38:23.220 --> 38:26.900]  around like a zombie or wearing a football jersey if you're wearing a
[38:26.900 --> 38:32.980]  football jersey and kind of shuffling around and look look like a zombie it's
[38:32.980 --> 38:37.020]  like you're not seeing the system but if your eyes are alive and I've seen this
[38:37.020 --> 38:42.180]  if you're awake people look at you they sense it the you know the police come
[38:42.180 --> 38:49.260]  over because having intellect having a spark of understanding a spark of
[38:49.260 --> 38:59.540]  consciousness is very painful to the to the Renfield Igor minions of this
[38:59.540 --> 39:05.700]  vampire system it's very painful for them to be reminded of their humanity
[39:05.700 --> 39:09.820]  very upsetting for them and there's different levels you know I'm not
[39:09.820 --> 39:14.740]  attacking you if you've got you know I wore a camouflage shirt because I thought
[39:14.740 --> 39:19.500]  it was cool and I was buying some stuff at Target a few weeks ago I saw a camo
[39:19.500 --> 39:23.940]  sweater and I got it I got camo for hunting and stuff and I wore it on
[39:23.940 --> 39:27.660]  air and I got emails saying I thought men that wear camo you're saying are
[39:27.660 --> 39:35.060]  wimps and you're being a hypocrite no that's not what I said I said that if we
[39:35.060 --> 39:43.660]  had real militia uniforms or camo you know camo is meant to blend in so urban
[39:43.660 --> 39:46.900]  camouflage would be whatever the dress of the area was that's all I ever
[39:46.900 --> 39:51.140]  pointed out and that when militias and people show up at city councils and
[39:51.140 --> 39:59.220]  stuff in you know Vietnam era camo it it it it allows the media to make it look
[39:59.220 --> 40:02.740]  clownish is what I was saying you're running around the woods doing whatever
[40:02.740 --> 40:07.620]  wear camo one turkey hunting wear camo I understand it's fun to wear camo I get
[40:07.620 --> 40:11.900]  it it's fun to ride a Harley-Davidson I get it it's fun to get in a fistfight I
[40:11.900 --> 40:17.500]  get it probably be funny get a big tattoo on my chest I get it it probably be
[40:17.500 --> 40:21.020]  fun to go to a football game and get drunk I get it but I don't do it because
[40:21.020 --> 40:27.500]  there's serious stuff going on and I mean I'm talking half the adult males I
[40:27.500 --> 40:31.900]  saw in Vegas were wearing it was an incredible anthropology to just see
[40:31.900 --> 40:37.740]  this culture we're wearing jerseys of their team and it's it's it's like
[40:37.740 --> 40:43.900]  almost weird now to be just be wearing a dress shirt and blue jeans and if you
[40:43.900 --> 40:47.820]  talk to somebody about anything but football it's weird see for me that's
[40:47.820 --> 40:51.180]  strange I mean I'd be in a restaurant and people wouldn't cheer when the bears
[40:51.180 --> 40:54.660]  got a touchdown and they get and they look at somebody and go you're not
[40:54.660 --> 41:01.900]  cheering because they noticed the person was wearing a bears jersey and again
[41:01.900 --> 41:05.380]  that's their tribe that's their culture that's what they value they don't value
[41:05.380 --> 41:09.260]  their son growing up straight and strong and no one about his freedoms and
[41:09.260 --> 41:13.140]  knowing how to clean a rifle
[41:15.140 --> 41:21.100]  I mean I can see having your son in sports have them in boxing or jujitsu or
[41:21.100 --> 41:23.660]  something they could take care of themselves I understand being in sports
[41:23.660 --> 41:27.020]  I just don't and if you're there cheering your family there should be small
[41:27.020 --> 41:33.820]  events not not these big you know music blaring and brainwashing okay now I'm
[41:33.820 --> 41:38.540]  digressing I want to open the phones up specifically about where you see the
[41:38.540 --> 41:45.620]  state of our culture because I can tell you this country has already fallen but
[41:45.620 --> 41:50.140]  it's going to fall further because the bigger you are and the more you think
[41:50.140 --> 41:54.260]  you're still a good nation the further you can sink because you're in denial
[41:54.260 --> 42:02.020]  but there is a giant growing remnant the good news was everywhere I went in
[42:02.020 --> 42:11.020]  Las Vegas the airplanes the the the restaurants the hotels I was stopped
[42:11.020 --> 42:17.380]  every 20 feet by people when I was by myself because a lot of the time been
[42:17.380 --> 42:20.500]  turned up be interviewing somebody else so I'd sit there at the hotel then they
[42:20.500 --> 42:23.580]  picked me up take me out to another location as he was doing a lot of
[42:23.580 --> 42:26.820]  military industrial complex stuff there and they picked a region where had more
[42:26.820 --> 42:30.940]  the people he needed to interview than any other than flew in the other folks and
[42:30.940 --> 42:34.300]  plus it's got cheap hotels so that's where the be a pretty big crew was
[42:34.300 --> 42:46.260]  staying and we're staying at the Rio kind of a rundown casino and so I would sit
[42:46.260 --> 42:49.860]  there for two three hours they're doing another interview at some location and I'd
[42:49.860 --> 42:57.700]  go around and film stuff and I'd it's so funny I'd be filming stuff in the
[42:57.700 --> 43:01.620]  casino and I'd see one of those guys on a power trip in his suit trying to look
[43:01.620 --> 43:05.780]  at people and I would just I would literally just as a task not that I
[43:05.780 --> 43:08.740]  didn't want to get an argument with him about filming in there that's all I'm
[43:08.740 --> 43:14.700]  stopping some other people so I would literally put a brain dead face on when
[43:14.700 --> 43:18.660]  I had the camera and when I saw what I'm looking at doing and I'd see them
[43:18.660 --> 43:22.260]  satisfied oh look that's an animal it's one of these unconscious people were
[43:22.260 --> 43:27.860]  sucking off of so I literally just kind of I mean I mean not even that bad I was
[43:27.860 --> 43:35.820]  just gonna zombie around like it's doing I want to zoom it's like a whole
[43:35.820 --> 43:41.740]  big of sociology test now I just come went around like that and even though
[43:41.740 --> 43:45.300]  it was a caricature of an idiot they didn't mess with me see the system is
[43:45.300 --> 43:51.900]  worried about power about human spark and electricity about soul the system is
[43:51.900 --> 43:57.940]  afraid of humanity it's afraid of masculine power it's afraid of feminine
[43:57.940 --> 44:02.340]  power it's afraid of God's creation because the globalist want to play God
[44:02.340 --> 44:08.980]  they want to create an aberration and their parasites who who were weak and
[44:08.980 --> 44:12.500]  sought after power because they were weak but had enough awareness and
[44:12.500 --> 44:18.380]  consciousness to get power and it is good men and women who are strong and
[44:18.380 --> 44:24.740]  who have a strong life force that are so confident we just kind of put our head
[44:24.740 --> 44:29.300]  down and smile and are positive as we watch rec society around us and we're
[44:29.300 --> 44:34.020]  trying to lift people up in little ways the way to lift humanity up is to face
[44:34.020 --> 44:40.620]  the full horror of what's happening to us and really admit you've got to do
[44:40.620 --> 44:45.100]  something that's why when I see people finally finally jump up out of their
[44:45.100 --> 44:49.300]  chair and say you're right I see it we've got to do something but then I see
[44:49.300 --> 45:03.540]  so many others who have awakened and you can see it getting to them I mean I
[45:03.540 --> 45:14.620]  talked to so many people who know what's going on but they say you there's no
[45:14.620 --> 45:20.540]  hope you can't turn this around there's always hope and it's when you get
[45:20.540 --> 45:24.500]  hopelessness that these bad things happen and by hope I don't mean some
[45:24.500 --> 45:28.340]  magical thinking like a fake Obama hope where there's no substance I mean
[45:28.340 --> 45:33.940]  common sense history what works the natural order of men and women and
[45:33.940 --> 45:42.620]  families in every culture what has made culture strong and pure but it is that
[45:42.620 --> 45:48.420]  sociological fact that you see in the anthropology and all the current
[45:48.420 --> 45:56.980]  cultures that a upright culture produces so much wealth and so much power and so
[45:56.980 --> 46:03.220]  much invention and so much strength that two things amongst many but to two
[46:03.220 --> 46:16.660]  paramount things then take place the children of the trailblazers become a
[46:16.660 --> 46:22.700]  little weaker than their parents and the next group becomes a little weaker and
[46:22.700 --> 46:27.220]  the next group becomes spoiled and the next group becomes spoiled and corrupt
[46:27.220 --> 46:38.500]  and decadent and into aberrant behavior because they're not being challenged
[46:38.500 --> 46:41.660]  enough and so the system creates artificial challenges for them the
[46:41.660 --> 46:45.980]  social engineers come in that's the one big thing that happens for the general
[46:45.980 --> 46:52.300]  public but in every state wherever the power is that draws the con artists the
[46:52.300 --> 46:59.060]  scammers the mafias the corrupt guilds the social manipulators who want to take
[46:59.060 --> 47:04.260]  control of that system and the corruption will take hundreds of years to
[47:04.260 --> 47:09.700]  take hold in some cases because it immediately gets power and funds at the
[47:09.700 --> 47:14.420]  first level of takeover people say well why would they a lot of elites
[47:14.420 --> 47:18.460]  spend hundreds of years taking over because each step they get more power
[47:18.460 --> 47:25.980]  each step their family focuses on the next step and then you really study
[47:25.980 --> 47:35.740]  corrupt evil families they send their children to be beat up at prep schools
[47:35.740 --> 47:40.420]  British royalty the ones that are strong they don't so much do it now and
[47:40.420 --> 47:44.700]  that's why they're falling apart but Prince Charles was sent to to a prep
[47:44.700 --> 47:49.340]  school where he was kept in freezing conditions and beat up and roughed up and
[47:49.340 --> 47:52.180]  then it was special families for generations that have been sent there
[47:52.180 --> 47:59.540]  certain families assigned to beat him up certain families to to to you know and
[47:59.540 --> 48:04.260]  then he goes out you know playing polo and fencing and boxing and you know
[48:04.260 --> 48:09.020]  proving himself and then in the military he's a horrible creature but the point is
[48:09.020 --> 48:18.700]  at least he's not weak so that the elites all understand this they understand
[48:18.700 --> 48:22.460]  that and they really understood it a hundred years ago and they would
[48:22.460 --> 48:26.540]  actually send their family off into real combat
[48:28.500 --> 48:33.180]  and I said I'd take your calls it's just you need to study humanity we need
[48:33.180 --> 48:38.060]  to know who we are and what the ruling elites have become to understand why
[48:38.060 --> 48:45.340]  we've gotten to this position so evil gravitates towards good I mean I have
[48:45.340 --> 48:52.220]  learned so much 15 years ago 10 years ago even five six years ago I had
[48:52.220 --> 48:58.740]  discernment against big structures but not people personally around me and that
[48:58.740 --> 49:04.100]  con artists and scammers and people would immediately recognize my inherent
[49:04.100 --> 49:12.220]  drive and my inherent humanity and would try to attach themselves and now more
[49:12.220 --> 49:18.620]  and more I realized that that that that you don't generally want who comes to
[49:18.620 --> 49:23.940]  you you want to go out and find people yourself whenever I go out and find
[49:23.940 --> 49:32.220]  people who to work in my operation who I haven't sought after me it works a lot
[49:32.220 --> 49:41.020]  better than people that seek after us and you see that throughout history where
[49:41.020 --> 49:46.500]  people in positions of power they go out and they've been watching people from a
[49:46.500 --> 49:51.260]  far the evil ones do this it's well known David Rockefeller on record will
[49:51.260 --> 49:57.700]  show up in the lunch counter line back when he was moving around more and would
[49:57.700 --> 50:01.860]  show up to get the top of a class person who they studied their blood lines who
[50:01.860 --> 50:07.020]  they are where they came from what they were going to do to hire them into the
[50:07.020 --> 50:12.420]  system they don't hire who comes to them they don't hire the people that come
[50:12.420 --> 50:18.820]  looking for the power evil wants good people to serve them but they want to
[50:18.820 --> 50:23.700]  see if they can twist good into a compartmentalized system to not
[50:23.700 --> 50:27.780]  understand the carriage they're pulling you're like a horse with blinders on
[50:27.780 --> 50:33.620]  they don't want you to see what they're really doing they want you to pull pull
[50:33.620 --> 50:40.340]  this big sled of coal out of the cavern that they've loaded as their big
[50:40.340 --> 50:46.060]  Clydesdale but it's not coal they're dragging up it's the souls of men it's
[50:46.060 --> 50:51.060]  the dead women and children it's the crushed nations that the American
[50:51.060 --> 50:57.380]  Christian male believes he's helping but really he's pulling the sled for Satan
[50:57.380 --> 51:03.860]  they're right back hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are
[51:03.860 --> 51:07.980]  now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did
[51:07.980 --> 51:11.100]  you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[51:11.100 --> 51:14.740]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds and I'll perform even gold and
[51:14.740 --> 51:18.580]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[51:18.580 --> 51:22.140]  our friends and solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[51:22.140 --> 51:27.100]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an

[56:11.820 --> 56:16.740]  location chosen because the fierce cold will help keep the company's racks of
[56:16.740 --> 56:21.020]  high-performance computers cool yeah right Facebook looked at several sites
[56:21.020 --> 56:24.580]  across Europe and picked this town for its cold climate the move will see
[56:24.580 --> 56:31.420]  Facebook become faster for users across Europe and it just goes over that no
[56:31.420 --> 56:36.340]  infrastructure because this is part of a face scanning database worldwide they

[57:37.220 --> 57:40.660]  is all compartmentalized only the top brain bugs know about it the first a
[57:40.660 --> 57:43.780]  model in the futuristic vehicle be ready by the end of the year it's designed
[57:43.780 --> 57:46.880]  to be capable of driving across the rubbish terrain like a Jeep sustained
[57:46.880 --> 57:51.780]  gunfire and takeoff and land but of course it's gonna have robots on board

[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:35.420]  you know I talked about Prince Charles earlier but I didn't get into why I kind
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:40.900]  of mentioning he has come out and said and of course we knew this and reported
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:47.900]  it about 10 years ago in info wars.com and got made fun of for it but the
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:52.380]  the British royal family hails originally where they first became a
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:01:02.460]  royal 500 years ago in Transylvania that royal house is not even really German
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:07.300]  they later came and took over what's Germany today but so I always say it's
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:12.780]  German royalty technically technically they're Transylvanian royalty and he
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:18.580]  has a program to try to upkeep the Transylvanian castles likes to visit
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:22.220]  every legend has a truth behind it they're not they don't really turn into
[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:27.340]  bats but their ancestors did like to chop kids heads off and bathe in blood
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:32.580]  the women thought that made them live longer oh yeah maybe David Ike's right
[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:36.980]  about everything but it's in the Daily Mail today I'll show it to you later
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:42.420]  that he came out and said we got to save the Transylvanian forest where my
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:49.900]  ancestor their founder Vlad the Count Dracula the Impaler the ruler of
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:58.020]  Transylvania you can't make this stuff up I've got that somewhere in my stack

[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:30.580]  speak there it's interesting David Ike in the reptilian brain but anyway what I
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:34.980]  want to speak about were the tech things going on here in Illinois I live in
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:39.900]  Peoria Eureka to be exact in our National Guard boy they were talking
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:42.940]  about how they couldn't wait until they were going to get the okay for the
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:47.700]  drones here in Illinois so yeah they've been announcing it in Michigan
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:51.460]  everywhere and they're gonna weaponize them first they're gonna have face
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:59.380]  scanning and taser shotguns that that fire a taser bought out you just type
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:04.500]  in new tasers fired from shotguns but they are gonna move on to nerve gas
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:11.380]  chemical weapons and and armor piercing rounds just a full weaponization of the
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:16.060]  government run by foreign banks against us you're right you're exactly right and
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:22.660]  then another thing that I was listening to and I looked it up on Jen genetic
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:27.500]  engineering and biotechnology news the Court of Appeals ruled that myriads
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:33.060]  patents on the BRCA genes are valid on the breast cancer and they're the only
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:40.580]  company now that's what I see happening too with future genetic patents no
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:45.300]  that's right they go in and they patent the gene for breast cancer which is
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:50.220]  your gene your body and then huge we had a guest on about that and then you try
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:56.780]  to go get treatment they say sorry it's 300,000 smackers for the first part of
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:00.820]  the treatment but you're like it's my gene and like shut up we'll throw you out
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:06.100]  of this hospital you get up any cops are waiting you wonder why the UN's been
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:09.700]  taking blood for all these years that's right that no no they admit though
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:13.180]  that's what they take your baby's blood worldwide at birth you in program now
[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:16.740]  admit it secretly and it's put the database then they patent your DNA and
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:21.060]  you can't use it and then only the elite can use it that's how this tyranny
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:25.580]  works and if you don't like it you don't like it you're not good why don't you
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:32.540]  love your government Mike why don't you appreciate all they do for it and I

[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:25.020]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:29.580]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:33.700]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:37.700]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[01:08:54.860 --> 01:09:01.540]  with calls in to the entirety of the third hour but but one of the articles in
[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:07.020]  the news today and we'll put it up on screen for prison planet TV viewers if
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:13.460]  not just go to the Daily Mail we also have it linked at info wars calm blue
[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:18.540]  bloods Prince Charles joins campaign to save Transylvania's forest because of
[01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:23.780]  his family connections to Count Dracula now we first reported on this 10 years
[01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:30.900]  ago actually David I did like 20 years ago but I didn't really believe it I
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:34.340]  wouldn't looked it up it's true that the first royalty that their main
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:37.340]  connection they're not really German royalty always point out when I'm on
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:40.860]  British radio that hey you guys love the royalty so much which most of them
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:44.300]  actually don't you don't even have a you know British king and they're
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:50.260]  German but technically the house that they hail from gets its first royal
[01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:55.500]  kickoff from the house of Dracula of course it had royalty back before it as
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:59.940]  well but they hail right back to him who ran Transylvania he was really King
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:06.180]  Dracula but they call him in modern times Count Dracula running Transylvania and
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:09.260]  Prince Charles likes to hang out there quite a bit sneaking around in the
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:13.420]  forest of course and of course there's always two these legends there's
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:17.260]  there's truth they're not really shape-shifting vampires they don't turn
[01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:22.500]  into bats from from what's been admitted but it was confirmed that in that
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:29.660]  region he liked to impale people and torture them and kill them but not just
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:33.500]  in the crusades but to his own people he'd stick them on poles naked you know
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:39.660]  lining the countryside until they rotted down to skeletons but his progeny then
[01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:45.980]  was famous in Transylvania over into Romania in chopping children's heads off
[01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:51.340]  and filling bathtubs with blood women are very vain as you know and so they
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:54.220]  believe the blood would make them younger of course it didn't actually make
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:59.060]  them live longer so there's a lot of vampirism going on there blue bloods
[01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:03.380]  Prince Charles joins campaign to save Transylvania of course what's a blue
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:08.620]  blood when blood is in the veins this blue blood is over a thousand year old
[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:12.700]  saying you put the origins of blue blood and they're saying these guys got blue
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:18.660]  blood where does that come from blue blood doesn't have oxygen in it blood is
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:25.700]  red when it hits oxygen that's why veins on your skin look blue blue blood the
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:28.900]  ancients were saying these people aren't like us they don't have oxygen in their
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:33.780]  blood they're zombies a blue blood would be a zombie and I'm not saying they're
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:41.420]  literally a zombie I'm saying these are the archetypal names like a lot of the
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:47.740]  Illuminati occultism is is into the zoolasterism and so that's the dog star
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:54.820]  what's dog flipped God what's serious you know the name of the radio network the
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:12:02.140]  dog star that's the weirdness I mean again everything is run by this cult you
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:06.180]  go to Las Vegas you see it everywhere you go to any big DC New York London it's a
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:13.260]  cultic stuff everywhere Illuminati mystery religion stuff everywhere until we
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:20.580]  get completely inculcated with it until it's just all around us and we don't
[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:25.460]  even recognize it anymore Prince Charles is campaigning to save the forest of
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:29.580]  transylvania inspired by his ancestral links to vlog the impaler a 15th century
[01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:38.060]  nobleman better known for his nickname Dracula or Patronim Dracula rapid
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:41.700]  economic growth in Romania which is now part of the EU means that the forest of
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:47.380]  the Carpathian Mountains are under threat from development and logging the
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:52.580]  prince is calling for the forest some of the last untouched wilderness areas in
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:57.100]  Europe to be protected before they get lost like the woodland that once covered
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:01.860]  Britain and I did some more looking into this years ago and he's also into
[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:12.820]  keeping up the ancient castles he likes it so there's this guy is literally the
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:18.540]  the the the next in line to be the king of England and well he likes Dracula to
[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:32.020]  say the least oh boy you know Frankenstein about elites trying to
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:35.740]  reanimate dead bodies turns out Benjamin Franklin was trying to do that with
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:39.660]  whitening you can actually go look it up they dug up a whole bunch of dead bodies
[01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:44.300]  under his house in England you know he moved and retired in England and he's
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:50.820]  part of the Illuminati Hellfire Club at Oxford I actually know somebody a
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:57.300]  prominent person who was led into the Hellfire Club to take part in things and
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:01.940]  told me this and then a day later I'd flip the camera on and sit well never
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:10.700]  mind point is it's very interesting see that's where all that comes from was
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:15.700]  alchemy I mean a lot of people were you know they say he first channeled and
[01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:21.780]  really discovered and named electricity Ben Franklin all right I said I'd take
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:25.460]  your calls and I'm rambling off into this we got a bunch of economic news huge

[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:36.620]  hey I was going to the radio that's okay go ahead glad to talk to you again
[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:43.460]  last time I anyway I do have a topic that's on subject but I was wondering
[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:46.140]  if maybe I could touch a couple of things well here's the deal this is what
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:50.780]  happens with my show and it's why I may go to call screening because we don't
[01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:53.980]  screen your calls I said I'd like to have it on you know on the subject or
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:57.660]  you see the world going which is a pretty wide open area and then everybody
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:18:01.020]  calls in and wants me to screen their call because people are used to call and
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:05.220]  talk radio and yeah what should you know okay what what what's your view what
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.860]  would you like to say on this let me pre-screen you to make sure it's what I
[01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:11.540]  want to hear from you and so instead though it we go ahead and just screen
[01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:16.540]  the calls but sir you talk about what just just go ahead obviously you're not
[01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:21.780]  going to just go ahead we're almost out of time oh no it's on subject I was
[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:25.900]  wondering have you ever seen the movie Brazil oh yeah no no that's where you
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:31.180]  think things are going yes it's kind of a dystopic redo of 1984 with a
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:37.060]  intellectual flourish by Terry Gilliam and is a masterpiece that yeah exactly
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:41.460]  Terry Gilliam you can tell he loves life in his movies and everything else but
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:49.260]  what I guess you know I I think that pop culture or entertainment creative art
[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:53.220]  you know creativity is creating new things it's what life is about is
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:56.900]  creation not destruction and not death and you know it's this cult and
[01:18:56.900 --> 01:19:00.340]  religion of death and destruction but no that's it the globalists do not like
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:05.300]  creation that's why they like to make ugly things that don't work right and
[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:08.140]  and and and that's what they do and that's why they don't like you if you're
[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:12.740]  healthy and good because they are literal soul-sucking psychic vampire trash
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:17.100]  that must be dealt with I'm sorry I'm gonna hold you over go ahead they have
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:21.300]  to control you know what creation actually is taking place and push it in
[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:25.740]  the direction that they wanted to go so as much as we work and we create and we
[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:30.300]  produce they're destroying and perverting and twisting it and it's like
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:34.900]  you were saying quoting that that music and can I stay with you on the other
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:37.820]  side yeah I just said so yeah yeah I want to hear from you and I'm sorry if I

[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:22.220]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:26.980]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:30.780]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:34.420]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:38.740]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:34.980]  they always go okay and they hang up I want him to be able to finish his point
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:40.580]  about the globalist or control freaks and they want to dominate everybody and
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:46.100]  so they're jealous of people that are strong pure and good that's why they
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:53.580]  want to corrupt people that's why they attack values that's why the social
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:58.100]  engineers do that they want a screwed up society in fact in some of these quotes
[01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:02.220]  by the UN and others they say we're going to give everybody a chemical in
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:06.620]  their food and water and in the future we'll announce it to the public and then
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:10.100]  only the government authorization will you be given the antidote to have
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:13.740]  children see people keep asking why would the elites be doing all this
[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:18.700]  because they have antidotes they have antidotes to the aluminum to oxide
[01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:25.060]  chemtrails they have antidotes to the vaccines they have antidotes these
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:31.260]  people are so horrible and only your mental weakness I mean literally 99% of
[01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:35.220]  the people that serve these people who who stake compartmentalized and oh this
[01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:40.180]  isn't true you're under attack as well and only your mental weakness will keep
[01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:44.300]  you from looking at the articles we posted today with links to the elites
[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:51.540]  saying this about you dozens and dozens of quotes from the UN you name it this
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:57.340]  is their plan Planned Parenthood US government CIA will you go read them and
[01:25:57.340 --> 01:26:00.740]  follow the links will you go to the Rockefeller Foundation's own site where
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:05.060]  they help brag that they develop vaccines that say they do one thing but
[01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:10.700]  really are designed to sterilize your butt I mean it's come out what we told
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:15.980]  you a decade ago flu shots do not protect you they're saying 1.5% of the
[01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:21.460]  time out of 100 almost 99% of the time doesn't protect you and that's their
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:27.340]  government study if you add into autoimmune system destruction which
[01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:31.820]  they admit the flu shots do then it actually causes the flu see they don't
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:36.660]  have full spectrum analysis anyone involved in full spectrum analysis would
[01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:42.180]  immediately integrate across reference overlay stratagem inside their mind to
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:45.220]  give a full spectrum analysis and that's not even a full spectrum analysis I
[01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:48.980]  cannot verbally give you a full spectrum analysis because I just overlaid
[01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:52.220]  probably a thousand things at a subconscious level for full spectrum
[01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:57.940]  analysis I gave you a two overlay analysis right there if the major
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:03.780]  Canadian German and US studies showed that the H1N1 shot doubles your
[01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:07.660]  chances of getting the seasonal flu that year or the next and that other
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:13.540]  similar flu shots have the same or worse effect if doubling your chances of the
[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:19.700]  flu the next year overlaid with the shot you're taking with a 1.5 out of 100
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:36.220]  people chance of protecting you then do the equation it's actually 0.1 5 under
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:44.740]  double so flu shots right at double your chances for flu you're right at double
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:52.740]  not double your 1.5 beneath double and that doesn't start adding in all the
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:28:06.180]  other equations this is mass death I mean here's my problem I watch I'm gonna
[01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:10.140]  try to play clip of tonight an ABC newscast with a doctor up there with
[01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:13.220]  this whole pitch if I didn't want to take it at first but then I decided I
[01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:18.940]  didn't I didn't you know then I knew a guy who got throat cancer so I'm making
[01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:22.460]  my kids take it it's all this pitch for people that have woke said I'm not
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:25.540]  taking H1N1 shot not giving it to my daughter not giving it to my kid the
[01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:29.620]  deaths the illnesses all this it's the same pitch different doctors different
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:32.860]  shows they're following a script and the guy looks so nervous while he's talking
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:39.140]  and like he's doing something really bad but big payoffs coming obviously through
[01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:44.340]  the system and it's not even a spoken thing you just get invited to the big
[01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:47.900]  speaking engagements the book deals the TV deals because you sell your soul
[01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:51.100]  right there and he said they're going yeah I didn't want to take it before
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:54.620]  now I see and everybody should have it and they're going yes all these cancers
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:59.580]  anal cancer throat cancer cancer cancer cancer but but then a little bit he
[01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:06.340]  asked her to the bottom the cancers when caused by this virus which is the
[01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:13.300]  rarest form 99 I mean way more than 99% of the throat cancer anal cancer stuff
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:17.780]  you know intestinal cancer is other forms of cancer but they were implying
[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:23.540]  all over TV and on all these shows I've seen that H1N1 you're not going to get
[01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:27.300]  throat cancer you're not going to get all these other forms of cancer see and
[01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:31.180]  they're actually wow CC it's really the the vaccines are giving you the cancer
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:35.260]  and they know this information's out so they come up with a vaccine that stops
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:41.220]  cancer but on their own insert it admits it doesn't even stop that form of
[01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:45.580]  papilloma virus triggered cancer see they never even want to discuss the fact
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:50.700]  that cancers viral so they're trying to spin what we've exposed we're on the

[01:33:55.100 --> 01:34:01.180]  because there's always a thousand other data points analysis factoids total
[01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:05.460]  proof of the globalist lies that I want to warn you about I mean on the vaccine
[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:09.820]  subject it's been known forever that they never get the right flu the year
[01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:14.220]  before guessing what it'll be the next year and then there's the fact of what
[01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:19.340]  injecting yourself with an attenuated flu virus does they've known for 50 years
[01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:23.860]  this stuff destroys the immune system triggers cancer on its own the adjuvants
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:28.780]  bound with RNA and DNA from the different tissues they're growing and on
[01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:34.020]  jumps into the rest of the tissues they know it okay they're adding stuff to it
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:40.300]  we've got the documents we're seen as a cancer and the globalist are giving us
[01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:43.620]  cancer and I'm gonna show some more proof of this tonight I covered it some
[01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:47.580]  last night but tonight on info wars nightly news if you're not a prison
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:52.380]  planet dot TV subscriber now is the time we've got the fourth annual money bomb

[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:09.940]  of $100,000 even before it kicks off to try to get to our goal that's what we
[01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:14.860]  did last year so folks please donate it info wars money bomb calm that's
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:19.740]  Kaiser's coming up in a moment but on the money bomb issue think of the of the
[01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:24.020]  trick the mind game David Rockefeller you know and in his tax-free
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:30.500]  foundations giving money also to us taxpayer money and then citizens go and
[01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:35.100]  give money to their local NPR station to be bombarded with new world order left
[01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:40.860]  wing side of the brainwashing spectrum but that's loving and good but when a
[01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:45.100]  constitutionalist says support alternative media boy do the enemies
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:50.140]  come out and say how dare you try to be you know once a year to build a bigger
[01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:55.140]  infrastructure which we've done the TV system all of it we want to hire a

[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:30.980]  it to MSNBC now Max Kaiser is coming up in three minutes we appreciate him
[01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:34.980]  joining us from Paris with the latest on what's really happening you know the
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:39.060]  devil in the details with this whole EU deal they really giving the bondholders
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:44.100]  a 50% haircut which sounds like the right idea what's this I read about
[01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:50.540]  because they won't give out the full text about grabbing the the quote
[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:56.540]  insurance on the German pension funds to back it up some numbers say 500
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:37:00.860]  million euros others say a trillion so it's kind of like the Copenhagen Treaty
[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:05.700]  we're not getting the whole thing Max Kaiser Max Kaiser calm coming up here
[01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:09.340]  in just a moment but first for just a few minutes I wanted to bring Ted
[01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:14.540]  Anderson up of Midas resources to give us his view on what's happening you know
[01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:18.340]  Ted the dollar if we put this headline up dollar is plunging against the yen
[01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:22.140]  right now you'll first it's the euro plunges and then now the dollars
[01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:26.660]  plunging I mean this is global currency devaluation and so gold and silver is
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:30.860]  going up today I mean that's common sense that they can knock it down by
[01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:34.260]  raising margin calls and margin requirements in the short term but look
[01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:38.100]  at a 12-year graph it's only going up and you're saying in the last month for
[01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:41.500]  the first time since you've been in business 30 years and gold and silver
[01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:47.500]  Ted that your phones are smoking hot even when gold's down now gold's up and I
[01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:51.660]  know they're burning up how long can you continue with gold and silver at the
[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:55.020]  prices they were a month ago when you bought that dragon's horde of gold and
[01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:59.260]  silver how long till it goes up on the Alex Jones specials well I can tell you
[01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:02.940]  right now Alex I've had such an increase today and I know where the volume is at
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:07.180]  I'm just not going to be able to hold at least a few of these items after today I
[01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:13.020]  mean we right now we have silver at 3548 at a peak 3535 right now trading
[01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:22.340]  currently up a dollar 88 gold is up at 1747 20 seen a high of 1748 30 up $20 for
[01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:27.940]  today I can tell you if even if you go to my website right now I have that
[01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:32.220]  campaign for Liberty coin that we've been talking about presently right now I
[01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:37.420]  have that coin sitting gold and I just have to find it right here it's on my
[01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:41.820]  should 517 there it is right there and if you go to the website right now you're
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:47.460]  going to find that same exact coin at 523 47 that silver dollars special that
[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:52.460]  I made an offer for at $73 I can't do it at that tomorrow you're gonna have
[01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:58.060]  that's two silver dollars 73 free shipping free book free video so I mean
[01:38:58.060 --> 01:39:01.020]  I mean that's a good deal two silver dollars for 73 bucks that's going up
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:10.740]  tomorrow 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 and I would say it supports the network in
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:14.700]  my show but I happen to know that yet even though we bought it low and is
[01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:18.700]  selling it low when it's high is making three four percent profit which doesn't
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:23.140]  even keep the lights on up there but when you call these are all lost leaders a
[01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:26.900]  whole list of gold and silver they've got but it's all running out it will go
[01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:33.380]  up tomorrow you heard Ted 800 686 2237 when you call ask for the Alex Jones
[01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:37.700]  specials Ted we keep explaining this to people they can short term drive down
[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:41.140]  gold and silver but it always beach balls back up I try to hold a beach ball
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:44.380]  underwater we'll get Kaiser's breakdown on this at a moment I mean it's just
[01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:48.940]  that simple but I talked to a lot of yuppies I've had distant not distant
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:53.060]  but somewhat distant family you see every few years laugh at me repeatedly
[01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:55.940]  because they always hear about the drive down every the drive up and I go have
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:59.980]  you seen a five year or ten year graph I mean you know this is the best
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:04.460]  performing investment but I don't say buy it for investment I say buy it for a
[01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:08.780]  hedge against crises and I mean I don't sell gold I bought it 300 when it hit
[01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:15.300]  2000 or I mean it's simple look I gold is it perfect silver is it perfect but
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:21.300]  it's it's light years ahead of paper currencies Ted it sure is and then you
[01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:24.980]  know what the European thing is not solved the United States problems are
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:29.140]  not solved if you see some market manipulation going on because the raising
[01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:33.180]  reserve requirements on on trading and so on and so forth that isn't going to
[01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:36.660]  solve the fact that gold and silver is going up because the rest of the world
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:41.620]  is melting down well all I know is silver's not a silver bullet but it's
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:45.740]  as close as you're gonna get to a silver bullet after all it's silver I mean a
[01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:49.860]  lot of people sit there and they say well gold was 300 I didn't get it it was a
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:54.580]  thousand it was 1500 it was 16 700 and I didn't get it so it's just too much now
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:59.300]  will it be too much of it hits 3000 and you wish you got it 16 1700 will be too
[01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:03.260]  much of it it's 5000 we're not happy we're right and this is happening but
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:06.700]  the dollar is in free fall right now and they'll jack it back up again it'll
[01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:12.060]  fall again but overall it's going down as every other major currency is this is
[01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:15.620]  global devaluation thank you so much Ted and that's what I want to talk with
[01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:20.980]  Max Kaiser commodities trading expert inventor of the Hollywood virtual
[01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:27.700]  stock exchange a model now used in many of the new systems a real pioneer very
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:34.620]  successful broker stockbroker in his own right TV host on BBC RT press TV I mean
[01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:38.460]  literally the list goes on and on he needs no introduction Max Kaiser max
[01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:43.180]  hearing that introduction there I mean I'm seeing all these signs out there
[01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:46.860]  where they say all over the world the signals been given to turn the presses
[01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:51.700]  up and so now there's not even attempt is the signaling I'm hearing to even
[01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:56.940]  deny there's global currency devaluation and that now a race has begun
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:42:01.080]  across the world to print as much money as possible use that crew have they
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:06.260]  decided to go ahead and drop the hammer Max Kaiser hey Alex great to be back
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:13.940]  on well the propaganda is really priceless the news is that there will
[01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:20.580]  be a 50% haircut on the Greek bonds but at the same time they announced a one
[01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:24.620]  trillion dollar slush fund which the president of the EU said they're going
[01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:29.900]  to expand on the first week to five trillion dollars using derivatives and
[01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:34.580]  so none of these bondholders are going to take any haircut at all there it's
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:39.340]  just a matter of moving deck chairs around on the Titanic it's pure
[01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:45.580]  propaganda the net result as you are alluding to is that the money supply
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:53.860]  numbers the bailout numbers the open spigot of the global printers is wide
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:58.580]  open and we immediately saw the reaction in gold and silver gold and silver
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:03.700]  immediately have traded up sharply on the news because they realized that had
[01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:08.820]  there been a genuine 50% haircut you would have seen the stock market go
[01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:12.860]  down and gold and silver are going down because that would have indicated some
[01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:18.860]  deflation but it's not deflation it's propaganda covering massive inflation
[01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:21.940]  by the way Max let me stop you because I'm looking for the mainstream news
[01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:26.180]  article where they actually give the type of derivative name and admit one
[01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:30.260]  trillion leveraged to five I'm digging around for it but if you can because
[01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:34.180]  this is breaking and again I wanted to this morning I said get Kaiser because
[01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:37.180]  I'm not a professional I want to make sure I'm reading this right because the
[01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:41.100]  headline says 50% haircut but then it says we're going to give you a trillion
[01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:46.460]  and then five trillion leveraged and then I saw in the German parliament
[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:50.700]  yesterday they said well this is going to be backed up by the German pension
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:57.540]  insurance fund so right well the entity that's pulling the strings
[01:43:57.540 --> 01:44:03.180]  here is the IMF you know the IMF a few years ago was bankrupt itself and
[01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:07.180]  about to go out of business and then suddenly because of these bailouts they
[01:44:07.180 --> 01:44:12.940]  have a new role to play and this new role is going to be as the administrator
[01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:19.820]  for the people of Greece for example they will they're gonna have police actual
[01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:24.020]  police on the street sent in by the IMF to make sure that people are paying their
[01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:30.420]  taxes and people are complying with these new austerity measures and so the
[01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:35.140]  Greek people have lost their sovereignty utterly and so the IMF is
[01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:39.140]  becoming a global banking facility as you have warned about for many years the
[01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:42.460]  global banking facilities are now being put in place the IMF will be the
[01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:46.820]  administrator the World Bank is going to be issuing some more special drawing
[01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:52.140]  rights which will be another a world currency by a World Bank and so the
[01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:56.620]  individual sovereignty these countries disappears Greece will disappear other
[01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:59.780]  countries in the eurozone disappear and of course this is going to be a
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:05.140]  phenomenon around the world the dollar itself this is interesting though Alex is
[01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:10.860]  that as troubling as the situation is in Europe it's actually better than what
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:15.900]  we've seen the United States the United States dollar is really the big loser in
[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:20.020]  this global game okay I want to break that down but before I forget to ask and
[01:45:20.020 --> 01:45:25.100]  and now they're they're moving the derivatives the 79 trillion that they
[01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:30.780]  admit they have into the FDIC protected zone at Bank of America and the word is
[01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:37.940]  from John Williams William K. Black I mean top economists I mean the word is it
[01:45:37.940 --> 01:45:43.860]  is truly a zombie that has run out of brains and it's about to die well it's
[01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:49.100]  amazing because during the 2008 crisis you had an investment like a bank like
[01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:54.100]  Goldman Sachs which was not considered a bank and not eligible for FDIC
[01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:59.860]  insurance because of the advantages they got as a broker-dealer making a market
[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:04.260]  and securities there's a huge benefit in that then once the once these crisis
[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:09.740]  hit they said oh wait we're now we're a bank so all of our all of our bets are
[01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:15.100]  now being guaranteed by the US taxpayer through FDIC now that that cycle is over
[01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:17.500]  they're thinking about well maybe we want to be an investment bank again
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:20.220]  because we want the advantages of being a broker-dealer we don't want to be a
[01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:24.140]  bank anymore Bank of America the same thing they go back and forth Merrill
[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:27.700]  Lynch was an investment bank then it's a commercial bank now it's back to being
[01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:31.700]  an investment bank meanwhile tens of trillions of dollars with the bad bets
[01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:37.420]  that were cooked up by the bankers during the run-up to the crisis those are
[01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:43.420]  now being moved from the balance sheet of Merrill Lynch Bank of America to the
[01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:48.340]  FDIC and that means the US taxpayer and how will they pay for those bad bets
[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:52.860]  they will inflate the money supplied by another five ten twenty thirty trillion
[01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:57.860]  dollars which means gold and silver will continue to go higher and higher as the
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:47:02.420]  dollar collapses and all fiat money collapses the euro is going to collapse
[01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:06.660]  as well but it's not as bad off as the dollar because within the euro zone you
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:10.260]  still have Germany and Germany is the number one export powerhouse in the
[01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:15.140]  world and they are playing a very smart game about keeping the euro cheap by
[01:47:15.140 --> 01:47:19.140]  encouraging default in countries like Greece at the same time boosting their
[01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:23.700]  exports and playing a very cozy relationship with China and so they're
[01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:27.220]  playing this brilliantly Germany's playing the best hand in the global
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:33.020]  financial currency wars right now let me I have one of those frustrating moments
[01:47:33.020 --> 01:47:36.860]  because I probably had 15 articles about this today financial Times London
[01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:41.180]  Guardian and I didn't circle or highlight it but I found in several
[01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:46.580]  articles and I'm gonna report on this later tonight on the nightly news where
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:51.660]  it actually said derivatives and gave the name of the type now here in this
[01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:56.860]  London Guardian they simply say they're going to take the old bonds and issue
[01:47:56.860 --> 01:48:01.620]  them under a new bond in new loans but they don't give the derivative name but
[01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:05.140]  actually in two of my articles which again I got here late so I didn't
[01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:08.660]  highlight it all and I can't find it they actually said it was a derivative so
[01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:12.140]  so I mean my point is I've been saying that this is what they would do is it's
[01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:15.860]  their standard playbook now they've done it and I wanted to get you on to make
[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:19.020]  sure I wasn't crazy and here you are over there you know breaking it down but
[01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:24.300]  even we go to break come back if you have to and you know dig it up during the
[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:28.380]  break because I want to give people the technicals on this because they are
[01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:32.900]  hiding this in plain view I'm getting emails if you go to go to Bloomberg and
[01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:38.700]  there's an article called EU says 50% Greek write down 1.4 trillion in fund
[01:48:38.700 --> 01:48:44.020]  okay I'll give that headline one more time Bloomberg yeah go to Bloomberg the
[01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:49.900]  headline is EU says 50% Greek write down 1.4 trillion in all we need is the
[01:48:49.900 --> 01:49:00.460]  first part EU sets 50% Greek write down EU says 50% EU EU write down that's it
[01:49:00.460 --> 01:49:07.220]  EU says 50% Greek write down yeah that's it that's the headline guys is that
[01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:12.940]  Bloomberg or is that San Francisco Chronicle that's Bloomberg.com okay
[01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:16.980]  that is Bloomberg okay we've got it on screen tell us where it's at okay you
[01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:22.100]  see the headline yes okay to go down to the end of the article leverage
[01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:31.200]  options under plans to be spelled out they go into how they can leverage this
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:34.580]  fund yeah but that's what I'm telling you that I've got and I've got two
[01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:38.100]  articles in here that I'm unable to find where they actually name the type of
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:43.380]  derivative and from my memory it's a really nasty one well it's a critical
[01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:48.740]  fall swaps of course are one of the prime derivatives used to move risk
[01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:53.180]  around the global banking system and to increase the leverage of these banks but
[01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:57.580]  basically it all comes down to accounting fraud where they they're
[01:49:57.580 --> 01:50:02.220]  saying that one one trillion in fresh capital to bail out these funds that
[01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:07.500]  they that one trillion has been borrowed from the IMF effectively and the IMF is
[01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:12.220]  going to borrow another five trillion on top of that to increase the
[01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:17.140]  indebtedness of the euros out not only let's explain this not only it will it
[01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:22.340]  devalue currency and hurt people that way but then they're raising taxes to pay
[01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:27.660]  the IMF who created the money and who created the Ponzi scheme absolutely
[01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:31.300]  they'll have to raise that the austerity measures will be more severe to pay for
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:38.540]  this new level of debt absolutely stay there max he did he did give us a
[01:50:38.540 --> 01:50:41.900]  source I know I've got it in mind one of the most frustrating things when I've
[01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:46.140]  got just just pools of papers blowing around I'm gonna I'm gonna dig it out
[01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:51.380]  and we're gonna go over that as well but it even says it's derivatives five
[01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:55.380]  trillion dollars and by the way you know the US has been paying for about half
[01:50:55.380 --> 01:50:59.220]  of this Federal Reserve ships our money over there so when you hear America's
[01:50:59.220 --> 01:51:03.140]  in debt it's for the bankers big Berkey water filters are in high demand
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:07.500]  storeable foods are also in high demand big Berkey water filters calm has
[01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:11.100]  always kept our focus on the Berkey water filter products but increasingly

[01:54:15.580 --> 01:54:18.980]  derivatives and digging through here they mentioned them I haven't found the
[01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:22.020]  articles yet because I read all these this morning and I didn't highlight it
[01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:27.180]  where they gave the name of the type of derivative but they admit that it is a
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:33.180]  credit default swap or the insurance on the guarantee that these bonds will be
[01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:36.860]  paid off these new bonds they're issuing quote in ties the Chinese to
[01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:49.620]  invest they say is is 1.4 trillion says 1.4 trillion in one of the
[01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:56.460]  articles and in the other one it says 1 trillion and then another it goes on to
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:59.740]  say that it will be leveraged and again we just went over that that Bloomberg
[01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:03.580]  article here's the Guardian Europe's leaders are claiming a victory in the
[01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:08.460]  eurozone crisis after agreeing to new deals let's slash Greek debt and increase
[01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:15.180]  the firepower of the main bailout funder around 1 trillion euros or 872
[01:55:15.180 --> 01:55:21.060]  billion pounds and then it goes on Greece that Greece's debt and derivatives
[01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:26.820]  is you know they're saying 100 billion euros but then you notice they want 5
[01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:32.420]  trillion for what again they're telling us it's Greece's fault and it's all how
[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:35.740]  evil the Greek people are but it's just like Iceland where you've been and
[01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:39.180]  covered this and predicted max they don't even know anything it's total
[01:55:39.180 --> 01:55:43.900]  bull just like we're about to have to bail out 79 trillion backstop that for
[01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:47.140]  Bank of America and when they're done with it on the news old ladies will think
[01:55:47.140 --> 01:55:51.380]  they're eating dog food because it's their fault max just increasing the
[01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:56.220]  debt load okay so if you want to understand derivatives all you keep this
[01:55:56.220 --> 01:56:01.260]  image in your mind take a dollar bill and walk into a house of mirrors and he
[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:04.860]  will show that dollar bill up to the house of mirrors and you'll see oh my
[01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:08.820]  god there's a thousand of these dollar bills no those are mirror reflections of
[01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:13.420]  your dollar they're not real that's a derivative it's the same bet on the same
[01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:17.700]  dollar over and over and over again and the credit default swap by the way is
[01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:22.620]  sold as an insurance product but there's no collateral backing a credit
[01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:26.900]  default swap therefore by definition it's not insurance product and if you
[01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:32.900]  have an insurance so-called product that is backstopping let's 60 trillion in
[01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:38.780]  bank reserves and that is obviously going to be impossible to honor if you
[01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:43.900]  have a systemic banking collapse due to selling credit default swaps I did the
[01:56:43.900 --> 01:56:49.700]  exact same thing on Wall Street you sell options on the market that you know
[01:56:49.700 --> 01:56:53.420]  never will you'll never have to make good on the options because the company
[01:56:53.420 --> 01:56:57.660]  that you're doing this for is about to go bankrupt Microsoft does it all the
[01:56:57.660 --> 01:57:01.380]  time they sell options on their own stock knowing that they can manipulate the
[01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:04.980]  stock in ways that they'll never have to honor those options Apple computer has
[01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:08.820]  done the same thing the options market the derivatives market is just a huge
[01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:14.380]  market for fraud and for playing manipulative games all these major
[01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:19.020]  corporations do it and hedge funds do it now we're seeing countries do it so
[01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:22.940]  now the IMF is encouraging the Central Bank of Greece and Ireland and other
[01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:27.300]  European countries to engage in the same fraud that we used to do on Wall Street
[01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:31.620]  that's now endemic in the hedge fund industry it's now being done on a global
[01:57:31.620 --> 01:57:35.420]  basis and they know we're waking up so they're militarizing the police actually
[01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:39.300]  saw in the article here what you said they're gonna have the EU enforce the
[01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:44.460]  new VAT on the Greeks literally EU troops making sure because the businesses
[01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:48.700]  are revolting and not paying it I mean this is really military occupation and
[01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:52.900]  now we know what the TSA is trying to take golden silver or search for it at
[01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:57.060]  airports and now they're on the highways I mean this is a criminal takeover it's
[01:57:57.060 --> 01:58:01.860]  it's a banker occupation and I call it the global insurrection against a
[01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:07.780]  banker occupation that bankers are occupying the economy and they do it by
[01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:14.340]  imposing debt that either a they fraudulently induce as was the case with
[01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:18.500]  the mortgage crisis and then of course Obama gave all those fraudulent and
[01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:23.300]  duck and docers of debt immunity they're trying to get complete immunity for all
[01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:27.380]  the hundreds of billions of dollars of the debt that was sold by Wall Street
[01:58:27.380 --> 01:58:32.260]  fraudulently it miss selling broke the law five different ways they want to
[01:58:32.260 --> 01:58:36.020]  complete immunity from that what happens when the president gives Al Capone
[01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:40.860]  immunity and well we'll be right back

[02:00:20.260 --> 02:00:27.820]  Alex Jones well we're really indebted to max coming on as a broker stock exchange
[02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:31.700]  system inventor to break down what's happening because I mean I'm reading all
[02:00:31.700 --> 02:00:35.420]  this in the news but it's all coded they admitted some new derivatives it's
[02:00:35.420 --> 02:00:40.340]  trillions and trillions between well it's a trillion plus they then leverage
[02:00:40.340 --> 02:00:44.060]  up to 5 trillion and they're saying yes grace it's your fault 100 billion and
[02:00:44.060 --> 02:00:47.580]  then most of that's derivatives that the government signed on to Goldman Sachs
[02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:51.180]  puts their people in all the government positions the IMF the World Bank do it
[02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:55.820]  your calls are coming up in the next segment we're gonna have max you know

[02:00:58.700 --> 02:01:01.420]  into all this other news and believe me there's a lot of new breaking stuff here
[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:06.020]  but max giving you the floor in the last four minutes we've got here where does
[02:01:06.020 --> 02:01:11.820]  it go from here I mean when tyrants get away with this much and now they're
[02:01:11.820 --> 02:01:16.260]  stealing the military pension funds and publicly admitting it and and and
[02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:20.700]  setting up checkpoints and suddenly all these new fines and fees to even have
[02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:27.660]  banking and making you go to cashless and Louisiana banning cash sales of any
[02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:31.420]  second-hand item I mean it'd be my god we'd really live in a prison here and
[02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:35.020]  they're just getting started I mean they've got armies of thugs and
[02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:39.020]  uniforms just going we can't wait to gang rape everybody I mean what do we do
[02:01:39.020 --> 02:01:43.700]  well a couple of points said to follow up on what we've been talking about here
[02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:48.580]  the president of the Bundesbank said today that these instruments that are
[02:01:48.580 --> 02:01:55.020]  being used to leverage the this new European fund are similar in design to
[02:01:55.020 --> 02:02:00.340]  the those that help to cause the crisis end quote which is a which is a
[02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:05.000]  remarkable admission he's saying that the way we're solving this problem is by
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.220]  bringing in the exact same problems that create the problem to begin with now to
[02:02:09.220 --> 02:02:12.660]  move on for a second what this means kind of on a bigger picture and if you
[02:02:12.660 --> 02:02:17.500]  if you increase the debt load in the eurozone by five trillion euros and of
[02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:21.140]  course that number will double and triple remember when tarp came in under
[02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:26.780]  Hank Paulson in the Congress when he got them to sign off on 750 billion and
[02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:32.260]  tarp that quickly became 15 trillion over the following 36 months so this one
[02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:38.940]  trillion euro EFSF fund will become 10 to 15 trillion euros in the next 36
[02:02:38.940 --> 02:02:44.300]  months as well but the only way you can keep these debts floating is if you keep
[02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:49.660]  interest rates down towards zero and this is a form of financial apartheid or
[02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:55.140]  a financial Jim Crow laws if you're rich white person you get you know a rich
[02:02:55.140 --> 02:03:00.220]  person let's say you get interest rates available at zero percent you can borrow
[02:03:00.220 --> 02:03:03.900]  money at zero percent or less than zero percent if you use interest rate
[02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:07.900]  arbitrage and other techniques but if you're anyone else in the society you
[02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:11.380]  know your credit card is 16 percent or 20 percent your payday loans are
[02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:15.580]  annualizing at 300 percent this is financial Jim Crow laws remember the
[02:03:15.580 --> 02:03:19.740]  Jim Crow laws from the civil rights era you know no coloreds here whites only
[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:23.860]  well this is the same thing on interest rates if you're part of the system you
[02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:28.820]  work at Goldman and JP Morgan your cost of money is zero or less if you're
[02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:34.180]  outside of the system you go to borrow money it's 16% minimum and going higher
[02:03:34.180 --> 02:03:37.700]  and of course people say well it's because the rich people never default on
[02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:40.900]  their loans which of course is false because if that were true they wouldn't
[02:03:40.900 --> 02:03:44.780]  be requiring all these bailouts they don't pay back their loans that's why
[02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:48.100]  they're being bailed out in the multi hundred trillion dollars of bailout
[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:52.100]  money in fact the people who are poor like the people in India who borrow on
[02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:57.460]  micro lending facilities they have a 98% payback ratio the poor people pay back
[02:03:57.460 --> 02:04:01.340]  their loans the rich people don't pay back their loans it's financial apartheid
[02:04:01.340 --> 02:04:05.940]  it's a financial Jim Crow my gosh I know I've got colors I've got to hold you
[02:04:05.940 --> 02:04:08.620]  over you're on fire I want to give you a few minutes on the side to finish max
[02:04:08.620 --> 02:04:12.660]  if you'll do it you're absolutely right because I've I've looked at this really
[02:04:12.660 --> 02:04:17.420]  rich people brag oh taxes are for regular people and it's always the rich
[02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:21.020]  people that are defaulting and not paying in fact I've seen statistics that the
[02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:25.060]  richer you are the more apt you are to declare bankruptcy or walk away from a
[02:04:25.060 --> 02:04:29.780]  mortgage because you're running a scam this it's a criminal class who's
[02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:34.420]  defaulted and having their whore media tell us all this debt is ours when it's
[02:04:34.420 --> 02:04:39.060]  these criminals and they've literally got brainwashed militarized police popping
[02:04:39.060 --> 02:04:43.420]  up everywhere cops won't respond to crime now they're all just literally give
[02:04:43.420 --> 02:04:49.220]  us the taxes just siege forces drones weapons government massing for gang
[02:04:49.220 --> 02:04:53.340]  raping total tyranny running rampant Kaiser I want you to finish up the point
[02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:56.380]  you're making and I promise I'm going to your calls first before I get to
[02:04:56.380 --> 02:05:00.060]  Napolitano knew about fast and furious and oh now I'm breaking an info wars

[02:09:10.940 --> 02:09:17.500]  what they said also Napolitano knew about fast and furious in 2009 of course
[02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:21.060]  they've all perjured themselves of course the eight federal law enforcement
[02:09:21.060 --> 02:09:25.220]  agencies are involved shipping cocaine in and guns out they always have they
[02:09:25.220 --> 02:09:31.380]  always will as long as illegal these are criminals these are brazen mafia lords
[02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:35.460]  who do not care and are preparing to start testing taking over all the
[02:09:35.460 --> 02:09:41.700]  communications with the EAS takeover system next month I mean folks do you
[02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:45.900]  understand this isn't a game this I know the show used to sound radical the new
[02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:49.740]  listeners because we weren't that far down the rat hole yet but I've studied
[02:09:49.740 --> 02:09:55.860]  history I studied this elite these people want to wreck your life they want to
[02:09:55.860 --> 02:09:59.580]  wreck the economy to take it over like a third-world country now finishing up
[02:09:59.580 --> 02:10:03.460]  with Max Kaiser as he was on a roll breaking down crystallize where we're
[02:10:03.460 --> 02:10:08.820]  going and am I right to say we've reached a jump point and and and they're
[02:10:08.820 --> 02:10:12.580]  saying that the signal has been sent now whereas countries were kind of
[02:10:12.580 --> 02:10:16.660]  worried about global devaluation of every currency zero hedge and others are
[02:10:16.660 --> 02:10:20.140]  saying now and I'm and we're seeing the state of the dollar plunging other
[02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:25.140]  currencies plunging that the signal has been given to Zimbabwe Weimar Republic
[02:10:25.140 --> 02:10:29.860]  absolutely go hog wild now and I guess their answer will then be steal
[02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:33.500]  everything that's left in the hyperinflation because they have first use of
[02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:38.140]  the money you were just talking about if everybody else 17 bare minimum some
[02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:42.820]  people 60% interest you said 300% annual on these little you know these
[02:10:42.820 --> 02:10:47.100]  little payday loan loan sharking operations used to be illegal and then
[02:10:47.100 --> 02:10:51.620]  they'll just be riots and that's in the IMF plan to even use that to then
[02:10:51.620 --> 02:10:56.020]  clamp down even more and this is just the new country the new world total third
[02:10:56.020 --> 02:11:00.140]  world slavery with lots of control freaks with machine guns raping our wives I
[02:11:00.140 --> 02:11:04.260]  mean that's basically where we're going yeah I mean just to follow up on this is
[02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:09.700]  zero percent interest rate problem in the economy is that if you're a criminal
[02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:15.700]  your your cost of borrowing funds is zero percent and if you make a bad bet you
[02:11:15.700 --> 02:11:20.260]  get bailed out if you're not a criminal if you're not a citizen your cost of
[02:11:20.260 --> 02:11:24.340]  borrowing your funds is on a credit card we know it's 1670 percent goes higher
[02:11:24.340 --> 02:11:28.020]  the mortgage rates could be higher but of course the housing market collapse and
[02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:32.380]  will continue to collapse because of all of the shenanigans going on with the
[02:11:32.380 --> 02:11:37.420]  banking system that is destroying the value of assets across the board except
[02:11:37.420 --> 02:11:44.140]  for precious metals of course so I'm going to be in limerick Ireland the next
[02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:48.300]  week and I'm accepting an award from limerick university for financial
[02:11:48.300 --> 02:11:53.700]  journalism for my work in exposing financial terrorism and I tell you the
[02:11:53.700 --> 02:11:58.980]  first to know that my speech will be on the subject of expanding and amending
[02:11:58.980 --> 02:12:05.260]  the Patriot Act to include financial terrorism acts and to include people like
[02:12:05.260 --> 02:12:09.540]  Lloyd Black find a jaming diamond in the Patriot Act as financial terrorists that
[02:12:09.540 --> 02:12:12.780]  we need to expand the definition if we're going to have a death penalty in
[02:12:12.780 --> 02:12:16.620]  America like we do in Texas we need to expand we need to apply it equally
[02:12:16.620 --> 02:12:21.460]  amongst all categories of harsh criminals from the guys in Texas who are
[02:12:21.460 --> 02:12:26.580]  caught stealing a hubcap to a financial terrorist on Wall Street that the law
[02:12:26.580 --> 02:12:31.020]  must be applied equally and we start this by amending the Patriot Act to
[02:12:31.020 --> 02:12:34.980]  include financial terrorism along with other definitions of terrorism this would
[02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:38.540]  be the subject of my speech to limerick university next week when I pick up my
[02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:43.740]  work for financial journalism from that university for my work exposing
[02:12:43.740 --> 02:12:47.940]  financial terrorism financial terrorism is real Alex it's not it's not a
[02:12:47.940 --> 02:12:52.900]  metaphor no I know this is their program they admitted me what was it 2002 all
[02:12:52.900 --> 02:12:56.180]  those IMF World Bank documents got leaked how they were consciously doing this the
[02:12:56.180 --> 02:13:02.580]  third world how they plan to do it here how they done it in Nigeria Argentina
[02:13:02.580 --> 02:13:05.460]  places like that how they were getting ready to do it here but but but in
[02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:12.740]  closing Max this is financial terrorism these are terrorists and if you pull up
[02:13:12.740 --> 02:13:17.500]  the BBC from like it was like January of this year it had the quote of the head
[02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:21.020]  of the Irish Central Bank in fact guys used to find that really easy the last
[02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:24.300]  few times I don't know if you haven't looked or you haven't found it but just
[02:13:24.300 --> 02:13:31.700]  try but but the exact quote is head of Irish Central Bank it's good to have
[02:13:31.700 --> 02:13:35.780]  foreign banks run Ireland and it was actually a clip to that's why they
[02:13:35.780 --> 02:13:39.500]  quoted him and he said it's wonderful we're signing on to global debt we'll
[02:13:39.500 --> 02:13:42.460]  have foreign banks run us now it's kind of like saying it's good to throw
[02:13:42.460 --> 02:13:48.700]  children into shark tanks or into pits of pit bulls it's good to put children
[02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:56.140]  in live children in meat grinders and turn them into hamburger meat you know
[02:13:56.140 --> 02:14:00.300]  you know it's good to shoot all ladies in the head I mean it's like this trance
[02:14:00.300 --> 02:14:04.740]  where they just throw out incredible stuff right in front of us and say
[02:14:04.740 --> 02:14:08.740]  Greece it's your fault we're getting five trillion now and Greece doesn't even
[02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:16.260]  owe anything I mean it's just the spin golly mind control
[02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:21.500]  bizarreness of it max that like when does it in how far does it go I mean even
[02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:26.660]  as it destroys our world consolidates power with the bankers and even as cops
[02:14:26.660 --> 02:14:30.260]  lose their whole future and the military and even a lot of military I talked to
[02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:34.260]  her away they'll still follow orders to literally do whatever they're told and
[02:14:34.260 --> 02:14:38.820]  they're gonna use them domestically I mean we are entering into absolute hell
[02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:43.020]  like there's no there's a rule in economics the law of diminishing returns
[02:14:43.020 --> 02:14:50.740]  for 20 or 30 years America's GDP would grow even though the level of debt was
[02:14:50.740 --> 02:14:59.460]  also growing until 2007 2008 when that equation stopped the debt kept keeps
[02:14:59.460 --> 02:15:06.460]  improving and keeps going up but the GDP is stalled out so American economy has
[02:15:06.460 --> 02:15:10.380]  reached in the end game in terms of growth so what it what's happening is
[02:15:10.380 --> 02:15:16.540]  that the elites are grabbing as much as they possibly can before the ultimate
[02:15:16.540 --> 02:15:21.100]  collapse and it's not building armored compounds all over the world publicly
[02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:28.340]  wow have while telling cops we're kooks if we try to get ready it's looting by
[02:15:28.340 --> 02:15:31.660]  it's the people living on Park Avenue and work on Wall Street they are looting
[02:15:31.660 --> 02:15:36.220]  the system for everything they can because they know it's about to collapse
[02:15:36.220 --> 02:15:40.860]  and they keep interest rates at zero percent to enable them to loot more
[02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:45.620]  quicker and everyone else is gonna be left holding the bag and as you said
[02:15:45.620 --> 02:15:49.580]  it's all conscious because they started setting up the police grids the takeover
[02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:52.940]  grids when they got rid of Glass-Steagall they they have a plan this is
[02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:58.340]  premeditated on purpose as they say a post-industrial society the plan the plan
[02:15:58.340 --> 02:16:04.340]  is not to reverse the problems you say you could reverse the situation by
[02:16:04.340 --> 02:16:09.380]  raising interest rates and weeding out the speculators as Paul Volcker did in
[02:16:09.380 --> 02:16:13.740]  the 70s and early 80s that would cure the American economy of a speculator
[02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:17.740]  problem but that's not going to happen because the speculators have their boy
[02:16:17.740 --> 02:16:21.740]  in place Ben Bernanke who's going to keep interest rates how far will they go
[02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:25.100]  I mean just when everything's completely wrecked and they don't even care and
[02:16:25.100 --> 02:16:28.660]  they're behind armored compounds I mean I I mean really this is they just want
[02:16:28.660 --> 02:16:31.460]  to wreck everything I mean what are they going to do with their trillions of
[02:16:31.460 --> 02:16:36.860]  stolen stuff if it won't buy anything and the country's on fire well there they
[02:16:36.860 --> 02:16:41.500]  are there's what I call suicide bankers they're no different than suicide
[02:16:41.500 --> 02:16:45.780]  bombers and Tel Aviv or somewhere else they have an ideology that they believe
[02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:50.100]  in the sanctum sanctity of making money at any cost and they're willing to kill
[02:16:50.100 --> 02:16:53.580]  themselves and others to do it and my story that I tell often about the
[02:16:53.580 --> 02:16:58.740]  broker who was in the building South Tower of 9-11 who stayed behind to trade
[02:16:58.740 --> 02:17:03.100]  options on airline puts instead of saving himself after the first tower went
[02:17:03.100 --> 02:17:07.340]  down that's a typical suicide broker in America that's the story of American
[02:17:07.340 --> 02:17:10.980]  finance right there stayed behind trade options that guy made five million
[02:17:10.980 --> 02:17:14.100]  dollars by the way it's still in a bank account for Deutsche Bank Alex Brown I
[02:17:14.100 --> 02:17:18.180]  used to work at Alex Brown it's never been collected he made five million but
[02:17:18.180 --> 02:17:23.420]  he died and that's American finance in a nutshell but he didn't care I mean he
[02:17:23.420 --> 02:17:26.460]  he wanted that cash even though he was gonna die
[02:17:26.460 --> 02:17:30.860]  it's a suicide banker he's gonna make five million dollars and kill himself
[02:17:30.860 --> 02:17:34.020]  just like a suicide bomber because he believes in the sanctity of making
[02:17:34.020 --> 02:17:39.180]  money his life is not worth the same as making the money for his ideology of
[02:17:39.180 --> 02:17:43.460]  Wall Street of psychopathy of Wall Street of making money and kill yourself
[02:17:43.460 --> 02:17:48.620]  and everyone around you that's what we're dealing with it's the same thing with
[02:17:48.620 --> 02:17:51.900]  the bureaucrats too all right Max we're gonna go to break and come back with
[02:17:51.900 --> 02:17:57.020]  calls I want to talk to you maybe from Ireland that via video Skype and take
[02:17:57.020 --> 02:18:03.340]  your laptop over and very exciting having you on and we appreciate you you
[02:18:03.340 --> 02:18:06.860]  know I think there is a lot at the end of the tunnel though I've noticed the
[02:18:06.860 --> 02:18:11.820]  right well I mean the Democrats have gone from trying to praise Occupy Wall
[02:18:11.820 --> 02:18:15.100]  Street trying to take it over to now having cops rubber bullet veterans in
[02:18:15.100 --> 02:18:18.900]  the face for no reason and now they're demonizing and showing they failed to
[02:18:18.900 --> 02:18:23.780]  really take it over look there's it's basically every man for themselves I
[02:18:23.780 --> 02:18:28.820]  hate to be to be the bearer of bad news but you know everyone has to decide for
[02:18:28.820 --> 02:18:33.840]  their but for themselves what's best for them because the systems collapsing the
[02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:37.620]  dollars collapsing if you have money is collapsing gold and silver of course are
[02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:42.020]  gonna do well but you know you have to be careful because ETFs are a problem a
[02:18:42.020 --> 02:18:46.140]  safe deposit boxes are a problem keeping it in your home is a problem so you
[02:18:46.140 --> 02:18:49.780]  have to be aware of all these things no no no we got rid of the Constitution we
[02:18:49.780 --> 02:18:54.540]  got rid of freedom people thought it was a stupid quaint thing and you know we
[02:18:54.540 --> 02:18:58.040]  let the criminal suite talk us and now all the blessings gone all the
[02:18:58.040 --> 02:19:02.580]  protections gone all the good things are gone and now we get to live just like
[02:19:02.580 --> 02:19:06.900]  they do in a third-world country yes but millions of people instead of thinking
[02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:10.540]  every morning when they wake up gee how can I do a good job and approve the GDP
[02:19:10.540 --> 02:19:14.740]  they think how can I save myself from this kleptocratic nightmare that's
[02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:18.180]  destroyed my country and they spend their entire day thinking about that instead
[02:19:18.180 --> 02:19:21.700]  of doing something productive and that's what they want because the sooner
[02:19:21.700 --> 02:19:25.500]  these people end up in a privately controlled and operated and own prison
[02:19:25.500 --> 02:19:29.660]  the more money they make corrections core of America the big biggest prison

[02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:27.380]  want to make a couple quick comments I've been you know I've been holding for a
[02:24:27.380 --> 02:24:31.660]  little while and you've been making great points and I have just a few
[02:24:31.660 --> 02:24:36.500]  comments first one about the whole cancer thing there's a great guy in your
[02:24:36.500 --> 02:24:41.500]  state of Texas by the name of Dr. Brzezinski and he's doing groundbreaking
[02:24:41.500 --> 02:24:47.060]  things in the fight against cancer and he's just done his FDA clinical trials
[02:24:47.060 --> 02:24:52.700]  and people should look him up if they're interested in a real progressive step
[02:24:52.700 --> 02:24:59.300]  towards the cure for cancer second point I heard you say that you know you have a
[02:24:59.300 --> 02:25:02.940]  ton of this information and you wish you can get it out to people I just want to
[02:25:02.940 --> 02:25:08.860]  commend you are you're making a huge difference every day every hour there's
[02:25:08.860 --> 02:25:12.780]  people telling other people and this really goes out to all the info
[02:25:12.780 --> 02:25:17.980]  warriors listening we got a support Alex there's nobody else out there really
[02:25:17.980 --> 02:25:23.540]  taking it to the global globalist the way he is he's putting himself completely
[02:25:23.540 --> 02:25:27.940]  out there there's millions of us out there everybody listening go go to the
[02:25:27.940 --> 02:25:33.020]  website get something a bumper sticker doesn't matter if it's $3 or $20 I
[02:25:33.020 --> 02:25:39.500]  don't care if all of us do it we put Alex in a position to go nationwide maybe
[02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:43.420]  on a major network who knows well that's what's happening already sir we're
[02:25:43.420 --> 02:25:50.340]  already reaching literally no exaggeration upwards of 15 million people
[02:25:50.340 --> 02:25:57.980]  a week sir and and and it's it's it's growing exponentially and people are
[02:25:57.980 --> 02:26:02.700]  only now really starting to realize this show isn't extreme we know what we're
[02:26:02.700 --> 02:26:07.380]  talking about but we don't have the big globalist funding we reach for the
[02:26:07.380 --> 02:26:11.500]  amount of money we have more than any other media outlet you're gonna find
[02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:15.780]  out there except for something like drugs report I mean we reach millions and
[02:26:15.780 --> 02:26:21.540]  millions and millions of people a day with hardcore info that that that is
[02:26:21.540 --> 02:26:25.740]  really changing the course of things and you're right sir when our listeners
[02:26:25.740 --> 02:26:29.140]  spread the word and that's what's happening it is exponential and it pushes
[02:26:29.140 --> 02:26:33.620]  me into very dangerous territory but I don't care there is no future I mean
[02:26:33.620 --> 02:26:37.700]  people thank me all the time for standing up against the globalist saying
[02:26:37.700 --> 02:26:40.820]  wow they're dangerous they could come after you look at how they demonize you
[02:26:40.820 --> 02:26:44.660]  look at all the trolls they have attacking you folks I'm gonna say it
[02:26:44.660 --> 02:26:49.540]  again the government has been caught and we've done news reports on this putting
[02:26:49.540 --> 02:26:54.500]  cancer viruses and sterilants in vaccines the government is not the
[02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:59.780]  government now the government is a bunch of crazy control freak killers okay in
[02:26:59.780 --> 02:27:02.740]  fact I need to get to these quotes here are at least I'll do it on nightly news
[02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:10.420]  tonight the point is that there's no future it's not it's like a wildfire and
[02:27:10.420 --> 02:27:13.860]  you live in the forest coming towards your cabin you're not full of courage
[02:27:13.860 --> 02:27:19.540]  because you try to do something about it or get it you know get out from its
[02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:23.620]  path I mean all but see I can't get out of this things path I got to fight it
[02:27:23.620 --> 02:27:30.340]  and it's an illusion so many people think they're on the winning team serving
[02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:33.700]  this evil and they get off they don't understand they're being attacked by it
[02:27:33.700 --> 02:27:40.420]  as well I'm sorry go and finish your point my last point is very simple something
[02:27:40.420 --> 02:27:46.740]  is great as the as the Constitution doesn't happen often it never happened
[02:27:46.740 --> 02:27:54.220]  before where everyone has the same basic rights it'll never happen again we have
[02:27:54.220 --> 02:28:00.460]  to protect it with everything people need to understand that these people the
[02:28:00.460 --> 02:28:04.900]  globalists that have this money you everyone thinks is so complex it's a
[02:28:04.900 --> 02:28:10.620]  simple answer they want to get caught like a psychopathic serial killer you
[02:28:10.620 --> 02:28:15.020]  just want to see how much they can get away with before we finally say we had
[02:28:15.020 --> 02:28:21.540]  enough and the numbers the numbers are on our side there they're outnumbered it's
[02:28:21.540 --> 02:28:26.300]  so ridiculous and that's why they're hoping that their technology is going to
[02:28:26.300 --> 02:28:31.140]  save them from the numbers but it won't and ultimately they're like a spoiled
[02:28:31.140 --> 02:28:35.900]  child they just need to get disciplined they could have played their cards
[02:28:35.900 --> 02:28:41.380]  completely different they could have been leaders of the world giving out
[02:28:41.380 --> 02:28:46.540]  technology they could have been leaders in bringing humans to the next level but
[02:28:46.540 --> 02:28:52.780]  again ruthless manipulators who who are jealous got in control and so they use
[02:28:52.780 --> 02:28:57.980]  it all to do to to bring society down and that's why all that evil men and
[02:28:57.980 --> 02:29:02.340]  tyrants seem to flourish is that good men and women do nothing as the founders
[02:29:02.340 --> 02:29:08.140]  said and look evil is going to be evil and when good doesn't take control of
[02:29:08.140 --> 02:29:14.460]  society and the culture what takes place in the vacuum the worst of the worst
[02:29:14.460 --> 02:29:18.420]  get in because don't you the evil's all fighting with itself to get in those
[02:29:18.420 --> 02:29:23.900]  positions that's one of the few things that holds back total satanic
[02:29:23.900 --> 02:29:27.100]  dominion on this planet is that so many of the minions fight with each other
[02:29:27.100 --> 02:29:31.420]  but that's why they're going to computers show that humans can't make
[02:29:31.420 --> 02:29:37.420]  decisions a casual society tells you what to do so that they can program it
[02:29:37.420 --> 02:29:42.500]  and then through reward and punishment carrot and stick control all their
[02:29:42.500 --> 02:29:48.100]  minions that's why they seek to make you an evil person to love torture evil so
[02:29:48.100 --> 02:29:52.900]  you can be their slaves we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on

[02:33:27.220 --> 02:33:32.380]  world order I'm sad to have to report that to you the globalists made the
[02:33:32.380 --> 02:33:39.060]  decision over a hundred years ago to make a scientific absolute tyranny really
[02:33:39.060 --> 02:33:43.860]  about 140 years ago they they put out the prospectus in Germany in England in
[02:33:43.860 --> 02:33:49.060]  the US this is all on record my film in-game covers it and they said we've
[02:33:49.060 --> 02:33:56.060]  got to set this up and they went to their scientists and the scientists all
[02:33:56.060 --> 02:34:01.380]  came back and said well if you're willing to do it and you are your highness or
[02:34:01.380 --> 02:34:06.500]  your robber barrenness you are supreme as as the elites always believed your
[02:34:06.500 --> 02:34:13.540]  blood is superior we will discover the essence of your superiority and we will
[02:34:13.540 --> 02:34:20.300]  we will set up a scientific mechanism to control mankind I say a hundred and
[02:34:20.300 --> 02:34:25.060]  forty years ago 200 and something mouthless said we'll put people in
[02:34:25.060 --> 02:34:31.020]  compact little cities and hopefully spread diseases in and kill them so it's
[02:34:31.020 --> 02:34:35.860]  older than that French and Indian war the British the manuals are public I've
[02:34:35.860 --> 02:34:39.540]  actually I was the Smithsonian I saw a copy one of those was a kid they just
[02:34:39.540 --> 02:34:43.580]  mentioned at the tour guide was one of the British manuals in this manual that
[02:34:43.580 --> 02:34:47.260]  you see they talk about the smallpox blankets and the best way to to treat
[02:34:47.260 --> 02:34:54.580]  the soldiers by lancing the boils and then place the fresh the fresh juices
[02:34:54.580 --> 02:35:00.060]  but these are technical term on to the blanket and then give it within 24 hours
[02:35:00.060 --> 02:35:05.020]  to the natives so I mean it's really older than that but it's this idea of
[02:35:05.020 --> 02:35:11.940]  how to do this scientific war and what is new is really old there's nothing new
[02:35:11.940 --> 02:35:15.900]  under the Sun just different higher variance of it or lower depending on
[02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:20.420]  how you look at it and every culture generally they knew what they were doing
[02:35:20.420 --> 02:35:24.620]  would just go into a territory and not interbreed with the group even if they
[02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:30.700]  were genetically similar they would just kill everybody kill everybody a lot of
[02:35:30.700 --> 02:35:36.140]  cultures said don't even keep the kids don't even try to retrain them kill them
[02:35:36.140 --> 02:35:41.020]  kill them all in fact kill all their animals the Israelites would do that
[02:35:41.020 --> 02:35:45.300]  they would kill all the animals as well just we don't even want your donkey we
[02:35:45.300 --> 02:35:50.860]  don't even want your horse your cow the Romans if you they had a saying in Latin
[02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:54.360]  before the ram hits the wall guys I can't remember it in Latin when you look
[02:35:54.360 --> 02:36:01.860]  up before the ram hits the wall and then put it up on screen I can give people
[02:36:01.860 --> 02:36:07.380]  the Latin translation of that you know the Romans would say you 100% give up
[02:36:07.380 --> 02:36:14.780]  and put up with what we do before the ram hits the wall or once the ram hits the
[02:36:14.780 --> 02:36:20.540]  wall we are not gonna stop and we're gonna kill everybody and then a lot of
[02:36:20.540 --> 02:36:26.180]  times because they'd seen the last 50 cities burned or villages they would the
[02:36:26.180 --> 02:36:29.780]  men would come out and they'd say all right stand right there your wives and
[02:36:29.780 --> 02:36:32.340]  kids are going to roam but at least they're gonna live they take that sword
[02:36:32.340 --> 02:36:35.780]  ram it straight down right here by the neck through the rib cage in the heart
[02:36:35.780 --> 02:36:42.060]  we'll make it quick good job made the right decision that's savageness that
[02:36:42.060 --> 02:36:46.500]  that's what that's what humanity does and we're all naive all the TSAs are
[02:36:46.500 --> 02:36:49.860]  to save me all the chemtrails all the drones I want to be my friend now they
[02:36:49.860 --> 02:36:52.820]  don't want to be the friend they don't send a Roman soldier in there to take a
[02:36:52.820 --> 02:36:58.140]  big short sword and just go yeah right into your right right into your heart
[02:36:58.140 --> 02:37:04.380]  quickest way in they don't do that they soft kill you they give you a shot that's
[02:37:04.380 --> 02:37:07.860]  gonna start killing you young some people are weaker so they die when they're a
[02:37:07.860 --> 02:37:11.660]  kid but normally it's meant to kill you when you're in your 40s or 50s get some
[02:37:11.660 --> 02:37:16.060]  work out of you get you and in debt and then you suck the money out of you and
[02:37:16.060 --> 02:37:19.880]  your family as they kill you with cancer and a little adult doctor is
[02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:24.460]  compartmentalized he could never believe this he's been domesticated for 50 60
[02:37:24.460 --> 02:37:28.220]  years why America's the good guys it couldn't do wrong alright I said I go to
[02:37:28.220 --> 02:37:34.340]  your calls it's a Latin translation but I just put in before the ram hits the wall
[02:37:34.340 --> 02:37:42.220]  watch this yeah yeah it's it's exactly it's before the rams touch the wall then
[02:37:42.220 --> 02:37:46.340]  no mercy yeah that's what it calculates out to
[02:37:46.340 --> 02:37:50.940]  but let me tell you something the ram hit the wall a long time ago and our
[02:37:50.940 --> 02:37:56.780]  people are dying cancer is just epidemic every other disease epidemic death
[02:37:56.780 --> 02:38:00.780]  everywhere almost everyone I know some of them have all their friends have
[02:38:00.780 --> 02:38:07.060]  cancer I was talking to a lady from Germany last night who came in to visit
[02:38:07.060 --> 02:38:10.140]  Aaron she said everybody I mean almost everybody she knows has cancer young
[02:38:10.140 --> 02:38:18.100]  people Muram Aris a digit the ram has touched the wall Romans had a policy that
[02:38:18.100 --> 02:38:23.740]  hell that once an assault had begun except no mercy or quarter the ram
[02:38:23.740 --> 02:38:28.620]  touching the wall referred to the battering ram in an assault take it to
[02:38:28.620 --> 02:38:36.220]  me grant no mercy and every culture this is how it's handled the men are
[02:38:36.220 --> 02:38:39.380]  killed the women and children taken to the bondage and a lot of cultures they
[02:38:39.380 --> 02:38:44.380]  just kill everybody cultures that want to absolutely keep their culture they
[02:38:44.380 --> 02:38:55.060]  kill everybody everybody everybody everybody all of them dead that's in
[02:38:55.060 --> 02:38:59.740]  game that's new world order they're not going to give you quarter they're not
[02:38:59.740 --> 02:39:02.780]  asking you for anything they don't want anything they're going to kill you and
[02:39:02.780 --> 02:39:05.420]  suck your energy out of you while they're killing you and they kill you
[02:39:05.420 --> 02:39:09.780]  slow and as painful as possible because unlike the Romans who just jab the sword
[02:39:09.780 --> 02:39:13.180]  in as quickly as possible are you gave up come on out here that you never fought
[02:39:13.180 --> 02:39:15.380]  we just showed up in your territory we're taking over we're going to kill
[02:39:15.380 --> 02:39:18.940]  your men we don't trust turn our backs while we're raping your wives we you know
[02:39:18.940 --> 02:39:21.300]  we know you're gonna get mad we're gonna kill you we're gonna let your kids live
[02:39:21.300 --> 02:39:24.620]  for now some will die in the gladiatorial ring but we're gonna make this quick
[02:39:24.620 --> 02:39:29.420]  sit down right there okay hands are bound all right make it quick hmm no no no no
[02:39:29.420 --> 02:39:32.460]  sick as the Romans until they got really decadent fell apart during the
[02:39:32.460 --> 02:39:36.540]  Republic phase didn't really enjoy the killing at a certain level but these
[02:39:36.540 --> 02:39:41.620]  groups is the beauty of a child looking like a concentration camp victim at six
[02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:46.260]  years old toddling around dying of cancer is so beautiful to the new world
[02:39:46.260 --> 02:39:50.060]  order vampires it is such an expression of art for them and I've actually studied
[02:39:50.060 --> 02:39:53.780]  it the globalist the top-selling artists dead children and maggot covered
[02:39:53.780 --> 02:39:58.300]  corpses and again you wonder why they'll pay 30 50 million for this stuff look at
[02:39:58.300 --> 02:40:02.260]  the New York Times it's it's a it's a gift it's part of their tithing to
[02:40:02.260 --> 02:40:08.260]  ugliness the obscenity of children starving by the tens of millions every
[02:40:08.260 --> 02:40:16.180]  year while the elite are paying you know 59 million dollars for a skull or or
[02:40:16.180 --> 02:40:24.220]  three million dollars for a glass jar with semen and blood in it with a crucifix
[02:40:24.220 --> 02:40:30.460]  it's an obscene look again they stole it from old widows and stole their
[02:40:30.460 --> 02:40:33.860]  pension funds and their husband's pension funds they they wreck societies they
[02:40:33.860 --> 02:40:38.420]  bomb third-world countries for this money just sucking it out and then they
[02:40:38.420 --> 02:40:42.660]  give it to some sicko guru artists who you know always have some devil name
[02:40:42.660 --> 02:40:46.860]  prancing around and they're into the weakness the potbelliedness the chicken
[02:40:46.860 --> 02:40:50.340]  neck of the little devil worshipper the elites going in and buying it it's all
[02:40:50.340 --> 02:40:54.420]  part of the sickness it's all part of the of the worshipping of the ugliness
[02:40:54.420 --> 02:40:59.140]  it's all it's all part of the love of it you now see the spirit of what we face
[02:40:59.140 --> 02:41:04.020]  and why of course it must be resisted and their soldiers and their black
[02:41:04.020 --> 02:41:12.380]  uniforms marching out and the potbellied goblin tsa all right let's go to your
[02:41:12.380 --> 02:41:17.220]  calls sorry I haven't I mean I'm sorry you will face the fool are or they will
[02:41:17.220 --> 02:41:21.860]  win you must break your trance you must break out you must stand up you already
[02:41:21.860 --> 02:41:24.180]  know I'm telling you the truth you can go look at all this information I've
[02:41:24.180 --> 02:41:27.340]  shown you you must awaken you must physically jump up out of your seat
[02:41:27.340 --> 02:41:33.660]  that's the sign of someone who's awakened awakened for war we didn't look for
[02:41:33.660 --> 02:41:40.220]  war but with war they will get war they must have they will not give us quarter
[02:41:40.220 --> 02:41:47.900]  evil wages war against good period and the evil's greatest trick is convincing
[02:41:47.900 --> 02:41:54.340]  you it doesn't exist steal your dreams blind your eyes
[02:41:56.100 --> 02:41:59.900]  your spiritual eyes
[02:42:02.300 --> 02:42:09.700]  JB go ahead you're on the air oh Alex it is a honor and a pleasure to talk to a
[02:42:09.700 --> 02:42:17.620]  another paladin in this war we got going on it's pretty good that you brought up
[02:42:17.620 --> 02:42:22.940]  the the spirituality part of this because I read a lot of prophecy a lot of
[02:42:22.940 --> 02:42:28.940]  scripture read a lot of revelations and sadly it's getting to the point where
[02:42:28.940 --> 02:42:32.860]  you can almost just turn on the news and kind of follow along you know in the
[02:42:32.860 --> 02:42:39.820]  good book I just wonder and this is kind of get your take on this what do you
[02:42:39.820 --> 02:42:43.780]  think about what has been that the message that's been given to us there
[02:42:43.780 --> 02:42:48.260]  in revelations it says that there will be an ultimate evil and it will take over
[02:42:48.260 --> 02:42:52.620]  the world and it will you know the dragon will be given the power to to kill
[02:42:52.620 --> 02:43:00.980]  the saints the one hour for it for an hour well what do you think is this a
[02:43:00.980 --> 02:43:06.060]  fight that we're just fighting to like hold off this culmination of history well
[02:43:06.060 --> 02:43:10.540]  look God has to let it go all the way to prove we're willing to go up against
[02:43:10.540 --> 02:43:15.140]  this this is an honor this is something good and all these blind people who can't
[02:43:15.140 --> 02:43:19.980]  see the evil now when it rises up and it's so horrible and then billions are
[02:43:19.980 --> 02:43:24.300]  dying then they will then that's the awakening and that's why the rapture is
[02:43:24.300 --> 02:43:28.420]  such a big line because it comes after clearly I mean a five-year-old could
[02:43:28.420 --> 02:43:35.500]  read that the devil's defeated he's bound up by the archangel and then all this
[02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:39.620]  stuff happens obviously the the beast wages war against the saints and
[02:43:39.620 --> 02:43:42.780]  overcomes them how was their saints if they all teleported out all these
[02:43:42.780 --> 02:43:46.740]  church ladies running around on the TVs oh praise God I go worship some glitter
[02:43:46.740 --> 02:43:50.820]  bug you know a feminine preacher that's obviously a demon anybody could look at
[02:43:50.820 --> 02:43:54.340]  them just a just a demon out in the open so that those that have eyes turn
[02:43:54.340 --> 02:43:58.140]  away from God as they see it's a demon it's just for blind blind little
[02:43:58.140 --> 02:44:03.620]  gibbering goblin creatures who are running from the fear it's a lower dimmy
[02:44:03.620 --> 02:44:09.740]  God is what these preachers are that they go before and that God promises them a
[02:44:09.740 --> 02:44:15.300]  way out of suffering okay they go to these low-level demons that sit up there
[02:44:15.300 --> 02:44:20.540]  and defile God and make God look weak to turn people with discernment away from
[02:44:20.540 --> 02:44:25.260]  God we have a look mid-level discernment so that's what the glitter bugs on TV are
[02:44:25.260 --> 02:44:29.660]  all about to sell their false doctrines to sell their evil to everybody fighting
[02:44:29.660 --> 02:44:33.780]  over all the false doctrines when when when when when have you tuned into God
[02:44:33.780 --> 02:44:37.220]  you're it's right there you feel it you know it you're not gonna have to be
[02:44:37.220 --> 02:44:40.860]  directed by some glitter bug preacher you're gonna be and you know me you're
[02:44:40.860 --> 02:44:44.860]  gonna be perfect either but you're gonna know right from wrong okay and each
[02:44:44.860 --> 02:44:50.180]  according to their gifts all of us are different but once you're looking at this
[02:44:50.180 --> 02:44:56.380]  system and once people realize what they're facing there's not a choice
[02:44:56.380 --> 02:45:00.140]  we're going through it anyways and and and then no doubt the world
[02:45:00.140 --> 02:45:08.060]  government's gonna rise and what I forget what they kill a third of the earth
[02:45:08.060 --> 02:45:14.060]  and just a very short period is a third or is it more I forget I mean that's
[02:45:14.060 --> 02:45:18.340]  what the UN says they're going to do they say they're going to kill they're
[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:24.060]  going to kill 90% or more they debate 80 to 90% and of course that's just so the
[02:45:24.060 --> 02:45:27.060]  small number doesn't think they're gonna get it really I've gotten a deeper
[02:45:27.060 --> 02:45:30.940]  research they plan on getting rid of almost everybody down to less than 1%
[02:45:30.940 --> 02:45:39.140]  and it says if God didn't shorten the days there would be no flesh left you
[02:45:39.140 --> 02:45:43.060]  pull up that passage and that's what's gonna happen that's that that the and
[02:45:43.060 --> 02:45:48.980]  listen it's not even religious now this is the real deal the elite believe
[02:45:48.980 --> 02:45:54.820]  they're the Merovingians they believe Jesus had these children with Mary
[02:45:54.820 --> 02:45:59.900]  Magdalene these royal bloodlines believe from Count Dracula right through the
[02:45:59.900 --> 02:46:06.900]  Prince Charles that they are the Christ and they believe their Christ Lucifer
[02:46:06.900 --> 02:46:11.740]  once has to kill the majority of the public because they're profane so that
[02:46:11.740 --> 02:46:16.980]  only the initiated ones can go in to the new system and they're all going to be
[02:46:16.980 --> 02:46:22.260]  deceived and they're all going to be destroyed but it doesn't matter and I
[02:46:22.260 --> 02:46:26.260]  don't get into religious stuff here very often because I just stick to the facts
[02:46:26.260 --> 02:46:31.380]  but there's no doubt let's let's just say they're in the God or a devil these
[02:46:31.380 --> 02:46:37.420]  people might as well just be it okay I mean they sure act like it I mean the
[02:46:37.420 --> 02:46:42.300]  stuff the New World Order does man I mean you've got to be blacker than hell you
[02:46:42.300 --> 02:46:47.700]  gotta be in the center of a black hole evil I mean just hellraiser you know
[02:46:47.700 --> 02:46:54.340]  off the charts you know I mean these people are literally might as well be
[02:46:54.340 --> 02:46:58.980]  interdimensional creatures that love watching children be torn limb from limb
[02:46:58.980 --> 02:47:03.540]  I mean that's what they are they like death they like barren planets that
[02:47:03.540 --> 02:47:10.300]  that's what we're dealing with we're dealing with cancer and it's either
[02:47:10.300 --> 02:47:19.820]  faced because all that matters is your soul you either face it and deal with it
[02:47:19.820 --> 02:47:23.020]  or you give yourself over to it and most people will give themselves to it
[02:47:23.020 --> 02:47:28.580]  because of the great delusion but as things get horrible a lot of them are
[02:47:28.580 --> 02:47:31.420]  going to wake up and that's the important point understand me JB oh
[02:47:31.420 --> 02:47:37.860]  absolutely Alex you gave the exact answer I wanted to hear and and I know
[02:47:37.860 --> 02:47:43.540]  you didn't even mean to do that I could agree with you more well if you meet
[02:47:43.540 --> 02:47:46.140]  somebody on the road and they know the truth and you know the truth you know
[02:47:46.140 --> 02:47:48.820]  you'll you'll you'll you'll wonder how they know they're thinking the same
[02:47:48.820 --> 02:47:52.340]  thought because universal truth is written on all our hearts it's whether
[02:47:52.340 --> 02:47:59.020]  we choose to see it or not I got to jump JB I appreciate your call but it is
[02:47:59.020 --> 02:48:03.740]  let's go to let's go to John in Wisconsin you're up next thanks for
[02:48:03.740 --> 02:48:09.340]  holding hi Alex great show yesterday and I think it falls in line very nicely
[02:48:09.340 --> 02:48:14.060]  with your recent broadcast with your guest Alfred it asked a lot of the same
[02:48:14.060 --> 02:48:17.940]  themes and I believe that was September 13th or 14th of this past not even
[02:48:17.940 --> 02:48:23.740]  themes it's truth you know absolutely and and when you talk about seeing that
[02:48:23.740 --> 02:48:28.900]  look in people's eyes and their level of being affected as I call it I was just
[02:48:28.900 --> 02:48:35.580]  at a production regarding the Wellstone assassination in Wisconsin and we like
[02:48:35.580 --> 02:48:39.620]  I play a little game with our friends called spot the spook and you can pretty
[02:48:39.620 --> 02:48:44.540]  easy to do actually and and I'm telling you what you're talking about gives me
[02:48:44.540 --> 02:48:48.260]  goosebumps because it happens to me on almost the daily basis and I can't
[02:48:48.260 --> 02:48:55.140]  explain that to my 41 employees and and just trying to convince them well when
[02:48:55.140 --> 02:48:59.460]  you start tuning into the truth in your own self and then you're able to
[02:48:59.460 --> 02:49:03.100]  recognize more and what's the saying you know the teacher appears when the
[02:49:03.100 --> 02:49:07.740]  student is ready and all of us are students and so it's always there
[02:49:07.740 --> 02:49:11.420]  people who are into lies will buy more and more lies people that are into
[02:49:11.420 --> 02:49:15.620]  truth you know it's like in any police to big police department they know the
[02:49:15.620 --> 02:49:18.780]  one detective to go to they don't know why he knows how to always find
[02:49:18.780 --> 02:49:23.980]  something it's because that person is tuned in and has that gift and so
[02:49:23.980 --> 02:49:28.940]  you've got that gift that's what it is and and going back to the original
[02:49:28.940 --> 02:49:32.300]  topic for colors today speaking of the future there are many many things
[02:49:32.300 --> 02:49:37.660]  conceptually enough I've actually just purchased 84 prison planet memberships
[02:49:37.660 --> 02:49:41.180]  of about a week and a half ago and I'm spreading out my little business cards
[02:49:41.180 --> 02:49:47.100]  to all of the truth seekers in Wisconsin and there are lots of them I have full
[02:49:47.100 --> 02:49:51.420]  spectrum awareness but I don't have what you have which is total informational
[02:49:51.420 --> 02:49:56.260]  awareness or as close to that it's not total I know it's it's a fraction but
[02:49:56.260 --> 02:50:01.140]  it still might as well be total because that that fractal goes into the same
[02:50:01.140 --> 02:50:05.220]  same makeup of the universe things repeat themselves over and over again so
[02:50:05.220 --> 02:50:09.860]  it's like the alchemists say so above so below once you know this part you know
[02:50:09.860 --> 02:50:14.860]  that part so people need to pay attention to the spirituality I mean I was
[02:50:14.860 --> 02:50:19.460]  raising a terry and I was raising a progressive anti-gun household I was
[02:50:19.460 --> 02:50:23.300]  vegetarian for three years with a long ponytail and living in Madison, Wisconsin
[02:50:23.300 --> 02:50:27.020]  things have changed so let's just say I'm a progressive libertarian with my own
[02:50:27.020 --> 02:50:32.980]  business and it's I have my own little soapbox but I'm working on a video which
[02:50:32.980 --> 02:50:37.580]  might be outlawed if I don't get it done it in time by the TSA legislation and
[02:50:37.580 --> 02:50:40.620]  I'm glad you just said that I'm gonna skip this final bright network bright
[02:50:40.620 --> 02:50:43.620]  station shouldn't cover this up so I can finish up with all these callers I
[02:50:43.620 --> 02:50:48.540]  want to say this to you right now people better use the internet like it's not
[02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:51.740]  going to be here next week stop just thinking it's always going to be there
[02:50:51.740 --> 02:50:56.220]  we've now confirmed the feds are telling them take down videos that are quote
[02:50:56.220 --> 02:50:59.220]  critical of the government we already have the fellow deserve trying to take
[02:50:59.220 --> 02:51:04.620]  down my channel that's reached 150 million itself all together 300 million
[02:51:04.620 --> 02:51:08.460]  the last two years just on YouTube they're already coming after us okay I
[02:51:08.460 --> 02:51:13.140]  don't get into all the behind-the-scenes stuff folks you better use it you better
[02:51:13.140 --> 02:51:18.140]  download it you better save stuff now you better start valuing information by
[02:51:18.140 --> 02:51:20.500]  the way that's a great idea we ought of people that want to get out memberships
[02:51:20.500 --> 02:51:26.220]  print up a monthly membership where it's a pre-made code and username and then
[02:51:26.220 --> 02:51:29.660]  sell them discounted in bulk where people get a one-month membership that
[02:51:29.660 --> 02:51:33.620]  activates as soon as that code goes in for a prison planet dot TV and that's
[02:51:33.620 --> 02:51:38.900]  totally anonymous well that is a good idea I appreciate your call well I need
[02:51:38.900 --> 02:51:45.300]  to write that down you know let's say you don't believe in God okay whatever it
[02:51:45.300 --> 02:51:49.540]  is let's let's say that and they've proven this in studies that whatever they
[02:51:49.540 --> 02:51:54.940]  have a monk a island of research monkeys and as soon as this island of monkeys
[02:51:54.940 --> 02:51:58.660]  figures out to do some new complex tasks they were trained suddenly an island
[02:51:58.660 --> 02:52:04.100]  five miles away the monkeys suddenly know how to do it so it's almost like and
[02:52:04.100 --> 02:52:07.580]  they've proven this is like a broadcast our brains are broadcasting something
[02:52:07.580 --> 02:52:12.420]  the sixth sense whatever and so evil has its resonance you want to be scientific
[02:52:12.420 --> 02:52:16.060]  about it something for atheists try to understand because we at least know this
[02:52:16.060 --> 02:52:20.980]  level is there and of course there's more but what's been proven is in all
[02:52:20.980 --> 02:52:24.620]  groups of mammals especially but also insects birds how do they know two days
[02:52:24.620 --> 02:52:29.340]  before earthquakes coming or or a hurricane how do birds fly four thousand
[02:52:29.340 --> 02:52:35.940]  miles six thousand miles magnetic lines there's parts of the brain a lot of the
[02:52:35.940 --> 02:52:39.820]  elites build power cities on magnetic lines the elites know all this stuff they
[02:52:39.820 --> 02:52:43.380]  know a lot more than we know I only have a limited lifetime to learn this
[02:52:43.380 --> 02:52:48.940]  information they secretly have guilds that keep the information and they're
[02:52:48.940 --> 02:52:52.860]  directed and you could call it the group consciousness of these evil people as
[02:52:52.860 --> 02:52:55.860]  they get together and that's what they believe they're doing to manifest I
[02:52:55.860 --> 02:53:01.380]  mean it's just it's unspeakably bad we the good people have to just cry out to
[02:53:01.380 --> 02:53:06.540]  the Creator and say empower us we repent and repent means we want to change we
[02:53:06.540 --> 02:53:11.700]  want to be directed by the good force and you have to say I'm turning myself
[02:53:11.700 --> 02:53:15.220]  over and you're not turning yourself over to slavery like with the devil
[02:53:15.220 --> 02:53:20.620]  you're turning yourself over to persecution but that is not even an
[02:53:20.620 --> 02:53:25.020]  issue once God church turning keys and opening doors I don't know how to
[02:53:25.020 --> 02:53:29.220]  describe it to people but it's it's unbelievable I mean you know all these
[02:53:29.220 --> 02:53:32.700]  worldly people looking for power looking for sustenance looking for
[02:53:32.700 --> 02:53:36.820]  fulfillment and the more evil they get the less fulfilled they are you want
[02:53:36.820 --> 02:53:39.620]  let me tell you something if you really serve the Creator the universe ladies
[02:53:39.620 --> 02:53:44.420]  and gentlemen you you are so fulfilled it's almost like God I can't handle this
[02:53:44.420 --> 02:53:49.460]  I cannot handle this level of understanding I mean with my primitive
[02:53:49.460 --> 02:53:52.540]  little brain because I'm still the flesh I'm still weak I'm still got all this
[02:53:52.540 --> 02:53:56.260]  evil stuff going on but then I've got all this other information sitting on top
[02:53:56.260 --> 02:54:02.500]  of it and it's it's like constant and it is a great weight it's empowering but
[02:54:02.500 --> 02:54:10.260]  it's also a giant weight on you it is heavy so look a lot of you people out
[02:54:10.260 --> 02:54:13.700]  there looking for power by the way if you get evil power it's got a great way
[02:54:13.700 --> 02:54:18.460]  as well people looking for power do you actually know what comes with power do
[02:54:18.460 --> 02:54:24.100]  you have any idea what comes with power I don't think you understand what comes
[02:54:24.100 --> 02:54:28.300]  with power and I have never wanted to step more into those positions and the
[02:54:28.300 --> 02:54:33.180]  responsibility and what it takes but it must be done because I am more sure than
[02:54:33.180 --> 02:54:38.540]  I've ever been 100% of the righteousness of the path that we're on and that we are
[02:54:38.540 --> 02:54:42.300]  going in the right direction does that mean we're perfect no the enemy always
[02:54:42.300 --> 02:54:48.180]  attacks us by pointing out how we're not perfect and and and and manipulates the
[02:54:48.180 --> 02:54:53.900]  humble it's time for the humble to stand up and stop second-guessing ourselves
[02:54:53.900 --> 02:54:58.620]  and take up the weapons of truth and liberty and charge the enemy head-on and
[02:54:58.620 --> 02:55:04.300]  in those fights we will find fulfillment is only and what's the military
[02:55:04.300 --> 02:55:08.740]  saying about physical training pain is weakness leaving the body what about
[02:55:08.740 --> 02:55:13.860]  psychic spiritual pain what about not caring about peer pressure to the point
[02:55:13.860 --> 02:55:18.100]  of you actually enjoy being persecuted not in a sick saddle masochistic way but
[02:55:18.100 --> 02:55:22.220]  in a way of knowing that their persecution is the fact that you have put
[02:55:22.220 --> 02:55:26.900]  them in a position to have to check what they're doing and that out of what you
[02:55:26.900 --> 02:55:31.060]  have done by applying force to them that you some of these people are going to be
[02:55:31.060 --> 02:55:35.340]  saved it's like when you've got I had a big old blister on the bottom of my
[02:55:35.340 --> 02:55:39.620]  foot from walking all over the place on my trip in a big pair of boots I didn't
[02:55:39.620 --> 02:55:47.620]  know would mess my feet up and I had this big almost stone bruised big big pool
[02:55:47.620 --> 02:55:51.460]  you know underneath big big calluses and I finally last night just got a knife
[02:55:51.460 --> 02:55:55.020]  even though it was bloody and just slice that off and let me tell you it hurt at
[02:55:55.020 --> 02:55:58.180]  the time but it felt so much better this morning to be walking around with that
[02:55:58.180 --> 02:56:02.380]  going people like what are you doing doing your own surgery I've got a old
[02:56:02.380 --> 02:56:05.740]  Army manual on how to field dress you know stuff with your feet it was no big
[02:56:05.740 --> 02:56:09.420]  deal it was barely paint me it was you know the lowest level of skin when I
[02:56:09.420 --> 02:56:13.020]  sliced it off but it's gone those people are you slice off your own giant
[02:56:13.020 --> 02:56:17.580]  blister it's no big deal the point is is it was painful when I did it but and
[02:56:17.580 --> 02:56:20.260]  there was even a blister below that level and I jabbed the knife in there to get
[02:56:20.260 --> 02:56:24.660]  that out of there but it hurt right then instead of days of pain and it
[02:56:24.660 --> 02:56:30.980]  festering you see and and so that's why I like persecution that's the sign of the
[02:56:30.980 --> 02:56:36.420]  weakness leaving their body I don't like the persecution myself but I know it's
[02:56:36.420 --> 02:56:40.660]  a sign of good things happening all right I've gone overboard again I haven't
[02:56:40.660 --> 02:56:44.180]  gotten to these calls I want to get to Father Jack with five minutes overdrive
[02:56:44.180 --> 02:56:50.500]  Alaric I like that name that's the Sacher of Rome 410 and then we've got I
[02:56:50.500 --> 02:56:55.420]  gotta go to pastor in Ohio he just got gave us the secret FEMA plans which
[02:56:55.420 --> 02:57:01.100]  were later made public pastor real quick what's on your mind what these other
[02:57:01.100 --> 02:57:04.820]  other people have been talking about is true you know it is a spiritual war and
[02:57:04.820 --> 02:57:09.260]  you said the same thing but you know one of the things that stands out to me is
[02:57:09.260 --> 02:57:14.780]  is this you know as you know I've been a minister for almost 30 years and I've
[02:57:14.780 --> 02:57:18.660]  never taken a paycheck because I when God called me into this it was not an
[02:57:18.660 --> 02:57:23.900]  occupation it was a calling and and here's the thing the pastors are not
[02:57:23.900 --> 02:57:27.060]  telling the people the truth they're not standing in the pulpit like they did
[02:57:27.060 --> 02:57:34.580]  before 1776 letting people know that they do have a right to fight back for
[02:57:34.580 --> 02:57:37.740]  the freedom that was all the whole purpose of the Constitution they was
[02:57:37.740 --> 02:57:46.020]  prayed over and and God gave these men over 235 years ago the the wisdom and
[02:57:46.020 --> 02:57:51.660]  everything to put all of this together so that it it would last for for hundreds
[02:57:51.660 --> 02:57:57.620]  and hundreds of years and and and that way as a republic then the people have
[02:57:57.620 --> 02:58:04.020]  the ability to keep it under the democracy or socialism or fascism you
[02:58:04.020 --> 02:58:08.860]  don't have that option where under a republic you do and that's one of the
[02:58:08.860 --> 02:58:13.500]  things the the wimpy pastor standing in the pulpit are not telling their people
[02:58:13.500 --> 02:58:17.700]  the truth that they need to be fighting for their freedoms it's all about money
[02:58:17.700 --> 02:58:23.460]  it's always been about money and and and you know it's just like everything else
[02:58:23.460 --> 02:58:27.620]  all the evil is going on in the world everything's going on you can see it by
[02:58:27.620 --> 02:58:32.100]  the trillions and trillions of dollars it's going to the big bankers it's all
[02:58:32.100 --> 02:58:37.380]  about the money well yeah the root of humans selling out is money but the
[02:58:37.380 --> 02:58:48.060]  spirit of evil wants the soul thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live com

[02:59:57.660 --> 03:00:01.740]  Broadcasting Network Network
[03:00:08.660 --> 03:00:11.820]  all right let's continue with some callers that have been holding father
[03:00:11.820 --> 03:00:15.220]  Jack in Kentucky you're on the air go ahead
[03:00:15.220 --> 03:00:22.060]  well mr. Jack thank you for taking my call you asked earlier today where we saw
[03:00:22.060 --> 03:00:28.620]  things going in the next two years yes and you also mentioned yesterday in
[03:00:28.620 --> 03:00:34.940]  your broadcast the Vatican requesting the or calling for the World Bank which
[03:00:34.940 --> 03:00:39.820]  implies of course a global government as well I said a one-world global
[03:00:39.820 --> 03:00:44.860]  governance power correct and and one of the things I see occurring within the
[03:00:44.860 --> 03:00:49.980]  next two years and I talk about this a lot of my blog and it certainly gets me a
[03:00:49.980 --> 03:00:55.860]  lot of tears from from both fellow Catholics and and others I see the
[03:00:55.860 --> 03:01:02.260]  Vatican playing a stronger role in this especially in Europe and I see the
[03:01:02.260 --> 03:01:09.540]  churches in America helping to further this the cause of globalism and and what
[03:01:09.540 --> 03:01:14.660]  I think a lot of people don't realize that the roots of this situation in the
[03:01:14.660 --> 03:01:20.420]  Catholic Church specifically go back to the infiltration of the church during
[03:01:20.420 --> 03:01:24.980]  the former Soviet Union they they sent people into the seminaries into our
[03:01:24.980 --> 03:01:29.180]  seminaries to rise to levels of power and influence and that is where they are
[03:01:29.180 --> 03:01:33.020]  today well well I mean that's what I've said because I don't get into all this
[03:01:33.020 --> 03:01:36.460]  I mean it's the Protestants the Catholics all these groups have the
[03:01:36.460 --> 03:01:41.380]  seminaries admittedly the World Council of Churches have been infiltrated and so
[03:01:41.380 --> 03:01:45.340]  debating when it started or whatever there's no doubt look at the fruits I
[03:01:45.340 --> 03:01:50.660]  mean look at what is being promoted in all these churches across the board and
[03:01:50.660 --> 03:01:59.500]  there's almost no one talking about any of these issues and it is just
[03:01:59.500 --> 03:02:05.140]  horrifying to see this unfolding and these megabanks are holding all these
[03:02:05.140 --> 03:02:09.540]  countries and systems hostage and saying give us this or we'll implode the
[03:02:09.540 --> 03:02:14.300]  league and and you know it's like you said there are a lot of people who are
[03:02:14.300 --> 03:02:21.420]  not addressing the issue of churches in the implementation of globalism
[03:02:21.420 --> 03:02:26.940]  churches are one of the primary fronts they should be one of the areas most
[03:02:26.940 --> 03:02:31.180]  part most people are the most concerned with because that is where people have
[03:02:31.180 --> 03:02:37.580]  a tendency to check their critical thinking skills unfortunately well look
[03:02:37.580 --> 03:02:43.740]  I mean my parents you know go to a mainline Methodist church and they
[03:02:43.740 --> 03:02:48.340]  were loved it and I'd been there some and it was good good stuff you know from
[03:02:48.340 --> 03:02:52.700]  my view good pastor well he just retired and they brought in you know some folks
[03:02:52.700 --> 03:02:56.780]  and it's it's it's clearly you know globalist and they're testing it there
[03:02:56.780 --> 03:03:00.460]  you and they'll ask him oh do you guys like this and people are kind of huh but
[03:03:00.460 --> 03:03:05.820]  I mean that's what's going on and people need to learn that you know the people
[03:03:05.820 --> 03:03:09.060]  sitting there preaching at you at the church I mean if it doesn't jive with
[03:03:09.060 --> 03:03:12.660]  reality and it doesn't jive a common sense of the Bible you need to get your
[03:03:12.660 --> 03:03:16.860]  butts out of there but there's this there's this God-shaped vacuum in all
[03:03:16.860 --> 03:03:22.220]  of our hearts and so when they put some globalist up there in a priestly robes
[03:03:22.220 --> 03:03:26.660]  or whatever people tend to think well this is this is this is but you know
[03:03:26.660 --> 03:03:30.180]  Christ they'd actually read the Bible it's all about the Pharisees being a
[03:03:30.180 --> 03:03:33.460]  bunch of hypocrites and involved in corruption and he's there rebuking him
[03:03:33.460 --> 03:03:38.860]  so they kill him and you know Pilate says I find no fault in this man and and
[03:03:38.860 --> 03:03:43.580]  he says okay fine it's a it's a it's a it's a holy day you can choose somebody
[03:03:43.580 --> 03:03:48.820]  I'm gonna release this horrible rapist killer Barabbas or Christ and they said
[03:03:48.820 --> 03:03:53.100]  Barabbas because that was what was popular you know people were sick of
[03:03:53.100 --> 03:03:57.460]  this guy telling them how they were corrupt and so there you go I appreciate
[03:03:57.460 --> 03:04:02.340]  your call Alaric in Omaha Nebraska we only got about a minute go
