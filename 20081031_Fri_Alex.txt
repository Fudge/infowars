[01:07.960 --> 01:12.800]  the war on drugs it is the war on the American people a lot of big new developments there and
[01:12.800 --> 01:18.240]  also initiatives across the country and try to decriminalize and how that's a wildly popular
[01:18.240 --> 01:25.800]  in every poll but the drug dealers don't want to decriminalize IE the police the military the
[01:25.800 --> 01:31.080]  government they are the narcotics traffickers and they want to be able to throw your children in
[01:31.080 --> 01:38.080]  their private prisons and so our business is very good for them they've destroyed America and so
[01:38.080 --> 01:44.920]  we'll be talking about that coming up later how do we reverse the total destruction of this
[01:44.920 --> 01:53.680]  country with Kevin Booth we're also going to have wide open phones and and you know I got a lot
[01:53.680 --> 01:59.640]  of news I want to cover and I can easily very easily go for two three hours without taking a
[01:59.640 --> 02:06.640]  breath and never going to your calls but on any issue any item the election the police state the
[02:06.640 --> 02:16.000]  economy the bailout whatever it is you want to discuss absolutely wide open phones today I would
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.600]  add the caveat that if you disagree with me you go to the head of the line that's like a royal
[02:20.600 --> 02:28.160]  flush if you tell us that and if you're a first time caller that's like a full house you know
[02:28.160 --> 02:34.000]  that's that's not as good as disagreeing but we'll put you to the head of the line if you
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.640]  volunteer that or you can call in like we had a caller yesterday and said he was Billy Bob from
[02:38.640 --> 02:44.640]  Timbuktu you know we don't tell me to be nice to know your first name we're calling from that's
[02:44.640 --> 02:50.360]  always interesting to see where listeners are tuning in from but you can call in from England
[02:50.360 --> 02:56.160]  and say you're in Japan you can call in from the South Pole and they'll say that you're on Pluto
[02:56.160 --> 03:03.080]  or from Burble Snap for me it doesn't really matter I don't think the listeners really care too
[03:03.080 --> 03:17.960]  much either so 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 we are only four and a half days Friday Saturday

[03:56.800 --> 04:02.320]  illusion heaping on the false conception that these guys actually run diddly squat
[04:02.320 --> 04:11.520]  pass their own personal bank accounts and their criminal operations they run nothing

[04:56.920 --> 05:03.280]  with us we'll be right back with all of it hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a
[05:03.280 --> 05:07.560]  long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need
[05:07.560 --> 05:12.160]  to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if
[05:12.160 --> 05:16.360]  you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care
[05:16.360 --> 05:20.920]  of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a
[05:20.920 --> 05:25.360]  good old boy bailout for the special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they
[05:25.360 --> 05:30.800]  turned off the telephones and email they voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air
[05:30.800 --> 05:36.080]  this money now owns the American and European banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[05:36.080 --> 05:41.440]  will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond
[05:41.440 --> 05:47.040]  many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany superinflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every
[05:47.040 --> 05:52.680]  two days until it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems
[05:52.680 --> 05:57.520]  as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to
[05:57.520 --> 06:01.800]  loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack
[06:01.800 --> 06:06.520]  up prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to be prepared and be ready
[06:06.520 --> 06:10.920]  everything is zeroing in on food one third of Americans have to choose between buying food
[06:10.920 --> 06:16.000]  and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient
[06:16.000 --> 06:20.200]  get food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you understand that by having
[06:20.200 --> 06:24.600]  a supply of storable food the government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so
[06:24.600 --> 06:29.400]  it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care of your
[06:29.400 --> 06:34.240]  family in the final equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable

[07:11.040 --> 07:36.000]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[07:41.200 --> 07:45.280]  you know there's a lot of gloom and doom going on a lot of serious things that face society but
[07:45.280 --> 07:50.720]  humanity's always faced with serious issues but we have a lot of fun behind the scenes I've been
[07:50.720 --> 07:56.600]  doing Cobra Commander limitations and Jesse Ventura invitations during the breaks and John is
[07:56.600 --> 08:03.800]  asking me and I am right now to do those on air I don't know John what do I get you know for
[08:03.800 --> 08:09.760]  acting the fool I know I I do enjoy screwing around I have to get the Jesse Ventura mindset
[08:09.760 --> 08:15.920]  I have to flash back to him screaming at my camera guys yeah in a fun way and huge arguments in the
[08:15.920 --> 08:22.000]  car with my spoiled colleagues who I could hardly conduct interviews driving in the car
[08:22.000 --> 08:28.080]  whether because they were enjoying the arguments so much off-topic issues but to let me think of
[08:28.080 --> 08:39.600]  one hold on you know Alex Navy seals we don't get angry we just get even and we take our time you
[08:39.600 --> 08:46.960]  gotta sleep sometime I'll do I'll do one later all right you want to hear Cobra Commander John
[08:46.960 --> 08:55.880]  you know you know I should wait until until I bring up the police state and how our police wear
[08:55.880 --> 09:01.320]  Cobra Commander uniforms that was part of predictive programming through TV they even drive the same
[09:01.320 --> 09:09.640]  black APC's or what are they called his mobiles yes I watched the show too I didn't watch the
[09:09.640 --> 09:16.880]  later series but I was like 910 at first came on TV and you've got the international terrorists
[09:16.880 --> 09:21.960]  you've got the international arms dealer Destro and that's basically a Donald Rumsfeld in the
[09:21.960 --> 09:28.680]  car law group but you want me to do the Cobra Commander the cover to scream you really want it
[09:28.680 --> 09:38.680]  okay actually come on there John and back and I'll do it please Jones do it I really did it
[09:38.680 --> 09:42.400]  last week in here before the show and people were in the other office they were like is that a
[09:42.400 --> 09:46.120]  chainsaw in there they all everybody came running in here but I don't want to hurt my voice actually
[09:46.120 --> 09:55.480]  doing a this is like morning radio now I've got to stop it I've got to control myself and get
[09:55.480 --> 09:59.200]  into the news here because it's all extremely serious and there may come a time we're not
[09:59.200 --> 10:03.200]  even on air if things continue down the road like they are right now and I wish to God I
[10:03.200 --> 10:08.440]  hadn't screwed around but you know what we got a little fun don't we all right let me do a
[10:08.440 --> 10:17.440]  cover to CC now once I'm on the spot it's hard to do a proper Cobra Commander you know what I'm
[10:17.440 --> 10:23.080]  gonna keep everybody on the edge of their seats later when it feels spontaneous I'll uh I'll do
[10:23.080 --> 10:36.080]  the that's not as good as the one I did earlier let me try another one here that's not as good
[10:36.080 --> 10:41.440]  as the earlier one that was it it's pretty good people are probably going to want on earth
[10:41.440 --> 10:53.760]  there you go but he has more of a like at this time you go there you go which one was
[10:53.760 --> 11:03.400]  better John you like that all right now I can go join the SWAT team and dress like
[11:03.400 --> 11:10.120]  Cobra Commander huh they back go work for Rumsfeld in the car law group and ship narcotics into
[11:10.120 --> 11:20.280]  the country and then bus kids using it huh how's that sound for Cobra John oh god I don't even
[11:20.280 --> 11:26.880]  you know folks I don't even cover the surface of how bad things are because I can't stand
[11:26.880 --> 11:32.400]  getting into it I mean it's the truth it's kind of like I'm in front of this giant buffet of
[11:32.400 --> 11:39.240]  new world order corruption and people say oh Alex exaggerates Alex you know he makes
[11:39.240 --> 11:45.800]  look worse than it is you have no idea whereas I can't get enough of studying it and learning
[11:45.800 --> 11:52.040]  more it is hard to come on here and describe just how bad things are and just how out of
[11:52.040 --> 12:01.840]  control things are and nobody wants to deny all of this and forget all of this more than
[12:01.840 --> 12:05.960]  I do but I can't do that because I have a family and I love this country and I love the people
[12:05.960 --> 12:11.200]  the planet and denying it has gotten us in the situation we're in so I you know I can't
[12:11.200 --> 12:20.640]  sit here and mince words or soft pedal what's going on we have very very evil people in
[12:20.640 --> 12:28.000]  control of society and it is the denial of that that has gotten us to the point where
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.760]  that but but but now there's not even that denial going on by the way up on info wars
[12:33.760 --> 12:39.480]  dot com yeah people are finally starting to wake up have you seen the new teaser trailer
[12:39.480 --> 12:47.880]  for this summer's angels and demons part two of the da Vinci code movie with Tom Hanks
[12:47.880 --> 12:56.400]  John sent that to me this morning and it starts zooming in over Vatican City and zooms in
[12:56.400 --> 13:05.240]  on a big statue of the devil perched atop one of the buildings that talks about the
[13:05.240 --> 13:11.040]  Illuminati having their revenge and in big bold text on the screen is the word Illuminati
[13:11.040 --> 13:20.240]  and then Tom Hanks says it's the Illuminati and all over TV now popular culture sitcoms
[13:20.240 --> 13:25.280]  dramas shows like heroes I've seen a clip of that it's Illuminati new world order they're
[13:25.280 --> 13:28.840]  taking over they're doing it and all these world leaders are suddenly saying new world
[13:28.840 --> 13:32.560]  order new world order new world order new world order new world order world banking system
[13:32.560 --> 13:38.320]  run for and by the banks I mean it's just it's everywhere they're just coming out with
[13:38.320 --> 13:42.720]  it flaunting and saying yeah we're taking the trillions of dollars and giving it to ourselves
[13:42.720 --> 13:46.400]  and bonuses and we're not going to help anybody in the economy and what are you going to do
[13:46.400 --> 13:49.920]  about it and yeah we got the army standing by to go after you and they're dressed in
[13:49.920 --> 13:56.760]  cover commander outfits what you're going to do about it and yeah we torture people and
[13:56.760 --> 14:02.640]  yeah CIA ships the drugs in and yeah even the Dallas morning news comes out and says
[14:02.640 --> 14:09.680]  yeah it looks like the government killed Kennedy two weeks ago I mean just out of control everything
[14:09.680 --> 14:16.200]  it's just insane but I know it takes a lot for some of you out there just not to just
[14:16.200 --> 14:21.680]  crack up or pull out or leave the country talking to Ventura privately yesterday off air he's
[14:21.680 --> 14:27.360]  like I can't wait to get out of here Alex it's just too much I I'm pulling this stuff
[14:27.360 --> 14:33.320]  up as you're telling me about it and I didn't even know how bad it was oh god I need to get
[14:33.320 --> 14:48.320]  out of here but you can't get out of here so you know what John queue up that CNBC clip
[14:48.320 --> 14:57.520]  to with the analysts talking about Illuminati let's play the CNBC one first that's we posted
[14:57.520 --> 15:03.520]  last Friday up on M4s I didn't get around to posting it till uh till uh not posting
[15:03.520 --> 15:07.880]  it posted last Friday to get around to playing it on air till yesterday but here that is
[15:07.880 --> 15:13.160]  again before I play the new DaVinci code clip here it is this at least you're getting back
[15:13.160 --> 15:18.640]  to the point where you can start to look at fundamentals and that's good news what happened
[15:18.640 --> 15:23.280]  I think you're in a liquidation phase I think Christian had it exactly right I think there's
[15:23.280 --> 15:28.720]  a bunch of wrong footed moves by Hank Paulson uh and the Illuminati of the country if you
[15:28.720 --> 15:36.880]  will and all right now here is the again it's up on info wars dot com it's it's a lot better
[15:36.880 --> 15:43.560]  um you know with the video more powerful but uh here is the new Tom Hanks movie coming
[15:43.560 --> 15:51.160]  out I guess in about six months in May there's a lot of disinformation obviously and I've
[15:51.160 --> 15:55.880]  scanned over the synopsis of the book you know basically the Catholic Church is fighting
[15:55.880 --> 16:01.280]  the Illuminati uh and the Illuminati is the secret world group of criminals trying to
[16:01.280 --> 16:09.240]  bring them down but uh still it's it it's the throwing it in your face that uh that's
[16:09.240 --> 16:25.720]  who uh is uh rising right now here it is
[16:25.720 --> 16:55.560]  in place which is why this is the perfect moment for our revenge

[23:44.320 --> 23:51.320]  titanic the other made the first terminator movie and that's because he's been spending
[23:51.320 --> 23:55.560]  over a billion bucks of his own money trying to come up with a standard of new movie theaters
[23:55.560 --> 24:02.840]  that are hologram theaters and i talked to folks that have been internally inside some

[24:55.080 --> 24:58.760]  my comment with that and tell you i've been listening to you for eight years and it distributed
[24:58.760 --> 25:02.800]  a bunch of dvds but i think you're all by your behavior yesterday with that eighty
[25:02.800 --> 25:09.840]  one-year-old woman i got a couple statements and a couple questions for you do you in any
[25:09.840 --> 25:14.080]  way appreciate how much courage it takes for an eighty one-year-old woman to break out
[25:14.080 --> 25:21.880]  of the matrix well i didn't know i was mean to her well you were short you were curt
[25:21.880 --> 25:28.640]  she was asking for help who knows how long she held but she was asking for help and
[25:28.640 --> 25:33.040]  you told her to buy a computer i know fifty-year-old people can't get into computers much less
[25:33.040 --> 25:38.360]  than i know i'm bad bitch hey alex i'm sure you gotta have a human side to you how would
[25:38.360 --> 25:44.760]  you like it if somebody did that to grandma emrick i was not mean to the lady and a lot
[25:44.760 --> 25:48.960]  of what goes on here behind the scenes i had a bring in papers into me i had a reminding
[25:48.960 --> 25:55.200]  me that we have a number people can call that i paid for that's physical landlines if it's
[25:55.200 --> 25:59.520]  not some internet conference call thing which is also a great idea we're getting ready for
[25:59.520 --> 26:04.320]  him to possibly shut the web down and so i'm spending two thousand dollars a month to offer
[26:04.320 --> 26:08.760]  this hundred and eighty eight lines or whatever it is she is not going to be able to access
[26:08.760 --> 26:14.040]  that with her age i mean she's gonna be able to dial a phone number she probably got charging
[26:14.040 --> 26:17.960]  long distance but the fact is you could have put her on hold and had one of your people
[26:17.960 --> 26:23.240]  on your staff helpers she was asking well let me stop you let me just stop you the staff
[26:23.240 --> 26:28.120]  is john harman up in minnesota uh... who does the job of answering the phones running the
[26:28.120 --> 26:31.760]  show for the far side we should have about three people in there my sunday show does
[26:31.760 --> 26:35.480]  have three people in there that's how it's normally done now for the last hour of the
[26:35.480 --> 26:41.680]  show we go live on video there is somebody out here but that's a separate phone system
[26:41.680 --> 26:46.840]  so i mean we can go back and replay the call i explained to her that we've dealt with this
[26:46.840 --> 26:49.840]  shortwave issue over and over and over again
[26:49.840 --> 26:53.360]  and uh... i mean i told her i was sorry
[26:53.360 --> 26:57.160]  shouldn't have gotten to that point i guarantee you jessie or will you want to talk to her
[26:57.160 --> 27:01.320]  like that and you wouldn't like it if somebody talk to grandma emrick that jeff i wasn't
[27:01.320 --> 27:05.880]  mean to her i thought i think you're really uh... i've dragged i've brought many many
[27:05.880 --> 27:09.460]  people to your radio show and reoccurring when i get
[27:09.460 --> 27:14.560]  they're put off by your bombasticness and i always say well i'm sure paul revere
[27:14.560 --> 27:18.960]  at the old and maybe bad breath but i don't undermine the message
[27:18.960 --> 27:22.920]  man well listen i you know what i really think that uh...
[27:22.920 --> 27:24.960]  that uh... you're you're
[27:24.960 --> 27:27.880]  conflating this or expanding an amount of a molehill
[27:27.880 --> 27:31.900]  i was frustrated by the fact that we know the shortwave's really been
[27:31.900 --> 27:34.640]  jammed or having problems or whatever it is
[27:34.640 --> 27:36.040]  and so we get
[27:36.040 --> 27:39.640]  calls five or six seven eight nine ten a day emails
[27:39.640 --> 27:42.680]  uh... about it there's youtube videos are people show that
[27:42.680 --> 27:45.360]  as soon as my show comes on it'll be clear before
[27:45.360 --> 27:47.080]  the minute my show comes on it goes
[27:47.080 --> 27:49.320]  it'll be like this is billy bob and all sudden
[27:49.320 --> 27:53.720]  you know the add-ins and then my show comes on it goes to
[27:53.720 --> 27:54.880]  so
[27:54.880 --> 27:56.240]  you know uh...
[27:56.240 --> 27:59.600]  we pay to be on the shortwave and it doesn't pay for itself
[27:59.600 --> 28:02.360]  so again i'm just one guy
[28:02.360 --> 28:05.880]  uh... people all day email me and call me to do this you do that
[28:05.880 --> 28:08.400]  we're flying by the seat of our pants here man
[28:08.400 --> 28:11.800]  deflecting my comment focus on what i'm telling you she's eighty
[28:11.800 --> 28:15.560]  one year that's great it's great it's amazing that she's even even in the
[28:15.560 --> 28:16.140]  fight
[28:16.140 --> 28:19.280]  well i i told her i was sorry the shortwave was so bad
[28:19.280 --> 28:20.960]  no no you're missing the point
[28:20.960 --> 28:24.360]  you were gruff with her like you do people that frustrate you that i was
[28:24.360 --> 28:27.800]  not gruff with her we go back and play the call i've listened to it yeah you
[28:27.800 --> 28:31.360]  were i wouldn't waste my time on the line calling you would you rather me

[33:36.720 --> 33:42.720]  there's a lot of folks 81 85 87 88 how old Sutton Gibson now
[33:42.720 --> 33:46.720]  like old-timers tended to know about this
[33:46.720 --> 33:50.720]  but but but just a very strange call I don't want to digress and this have a
[33:50.720 --> 33:54.720]  lot of calls to get to a lot of news to cover but but John Harmon you know who
[33:54.720 --> 33:57.720]  runs things up Minnesota he was popping in my ear during the break on what's that
[33:57.720 --> 34:00.720]  talking about you have that lady on for like four or five minutes and we had to
[34:00.720 --> 34:03.720]  get you know to the next person or we never get to your calls
[34:03.720 --> 34:05.720]  John you want to comment on that
[34:05.720 --> 34:09.720]  yeah I was just gonna say there was at least three minutes with that lady and
[34:09.720 --> 34:12.720]  you were patient with her she you know you explained to her that shortwave is
[34:12.720 --> 34:18.720]  unreliable so and you you know nicely said you should get a computer because
[34:18.720 --> 34:23.720]  that is totally reliable and you always get the feed no matter what so
[34:23.720 --> 34:27.720]  yeah you spent plenty time and I said to the listeners that's what we need am and
[34:27.720 --> 34:31.720]  FM's and pretty much everywhere or we could do micro FM or I said here's a
[34:31.720 --> 34:33.720]  number for you to call we can listen to the show
[34:33.720 --> 34:37.720]  exactly and then I even tried to give her a tip knowing that we found out my
[34:37.720 --> 34:42.720]  grandmother was still on some 20 year old phone plan because you know they don't
[34:42.720 --> 34:46.720]  know where you're you know she was still paying like a you know 30 cents or
[34:46.720 --> 34:50.720]  something a minute when you can go out and basically get unlimited or you know
[34:50.720 --> 34:54.720]  two cents a minute or Vonich which is a regular phone they just come put it in
[34:54.720 --> 34:58.720]  so I was giving her good advice yeah I guess I should have just said and this is
[34:58.720 --> 35:02.720]  what other show hosts do about Freud they go yeah we're all being jammed and
[35:02.720 --> 35:06.720]  I'll get right on that and I guess just tell them what they want to hear the
[35:06.720 --> 35:10.720]  problem is I don't do that yeah there's a million ways to listen to show and you
[35:10.720 --> 35:13.720]  were patient with her I didn't think that came off at all that you were being
[35:13.720 --> 35:19.720]  rude so well I'm evil basically I have to come to grips with that
[35:19.720 --> 35:24.720]  look man a lot of days I get in here and I'm upset about what's going on I'm
[35:24.720 --> 35:29.720]  upset about all the news I'm upset about what's happening when I sit around the
[35:29.720 --> 35:32.720]  dinner table with my wife freaked out I sit around the table with friends freaked
[35:32.720 --> 35:37.720]  out I mean I this is not a game or a joke I try to have some fun I'm actually a
[35:37.720 --> 35:44.720]  funny nice friendly guy except when I get in war mode and I don't know why I'm
[35:44.720 --> 35:48.720]  held to such a high standard but but nobody else is I mean I get emails
[35:48.720 --> 35:53.720]  every day viciously attacking saying you didn't interview me or you didn't cover
[35:53.720 --> 36:00.720]  this event or you didn't cover this story or you didn't respond to my email I
[36:00.720 --> 36:04.720]  mean it's hard enough to read them I want your emails I'm reading them we're
[36:04.720 --> 36:09.720]  reading them a lot of times we print off stacks of things I want to respond to
[36:09.720 --> 36:13.720]  not just forget about it I mean I got radio station promos to cut for
[36:13.720 --> 36:17.720]  stations I'm not whining either I'm just folks I'm people think this is like
[36:17.720 --> 36:23.720]  some big glistening building with you know antennae and gun turrets on it and
[36:23.720 --> 36:27.720]  there's thousands of people in suits with shaved heads typing at computers and
[36:27.720 --> 36:35.720]  we're all that's you folks you're the info or you're the power not me
[36:35.720 --> 36:41.720]  I'm lucky I get a cup of coffee around here
[36:41.720 --> 36:44.720]  but I don't want to digress into this but it's become such a big issue because

[39:32.720 --> 39:38.720]  that then other people are counterfeits I don't get into it I think everybody's

[39:46.720 --> 39:50.720]  the Bible is true so but the Bible doesn't say that the Bible doesn't say

[40:50.720 --> 40:59.720]  that's why I Marcus Garvey and all that stuff so I'm the devil okay I
[40:59.720 --> 41:04.720]  understand it's like the last dollar I'm about a devil all right the fact the
[41:04.720 --> 41:09.720]  fact that you have Indian on your father father family means and it explains why
[41:09.720 --> 41:13.720]  you're so passionate about this and what you were trying to see I was like you
[41:13.720 --> 41:19.720]  I'm trying to convince wicked ass people excuse my French all right that what's
[41:19.720 --> 41:23.720]  going on in the world I used to give them your DVDs and all this and I forget
[41:23.720 --> 41:27.720]  catch up for it okay you're not going to wake up the wicked yeah you have to
[41:27.720 --> 41:31.720]  understand who is who and you have to go back to the Bible that's why America is
[41:31.720 --> 41:36.720]  Babylon you don't think America's by one the great any nation that it's not
[41:36.720 --> 41:39.720]  America well can I answer your question you keep answering you can you ask
[41:39.720 --> 41:47.720]  questions do you want the answer but sir any nation whether it was the original
[41:47.720 --> 41:53.720]  Babylon the tiger she freighties 55 miles south of where Baghdad is today or
[41:53.720 --> 41:57.720]  whether it was ancient Rome or whether it was Greece or whether it was African
[41:57.720 --> 42:03.720]  kingdoms or whether it was Asian kingdoms powerful empires always become corrupt
[42:03.720 --> 42:08.720]  it's the nature of entropy in society it's the nature of elites becoming
[42:08.720 --> 42:15.720]  decadent it is the nature of man and it was the transatlantic slave trade that
[42:15.720 --> 42:20.720]  misinterpreted the Bible that said that blacks were Edomites and so they were
[42:20.720 --> 42:26.720]  basically sinners and so they deserve to be slaves now the now other groups then
[42:26.720 --> 42:31.720]  can then take that and say well no actually you the white devil are the
[42:31.720 --> 42:36.720]  Edomite and it just goes on and on and so much bad has been done in the name of
[42:36.720 --> 42:41.720]  that so I have the white supremacist hating me I have the Christian identity
[42:41.720 --> 42:46.720]  people hating me I have the black Israelites disliking me I have every
[42:46.720 --> 42:50.720]  group because I don't believe you're inherently evil because you're black
[42:50.720 --> 42:54.720]  or you're white or you're Chinese I just I don't and I'm sorry I'm never am so
[42:54.720 --> 42:59.720]  I don't understand that yeah well well let me defend my position okay because
[42:59.720 --> 43:02.720]  you say you're you're into but I knew your position you notice I knew your
[43:02.720 --> 43:06.720]  position beforehand because I am studied sir I just don't know what you do I'm
[43:06.720 --> 43:10.720]  sure I've sent you emails and I'm sure you're a very well-read person so you
[43:10.720 --> 43:14.720]  wouldn't know about the black Hebrews life but what I'm trying to show you is
[43:14.720 --> 43:18.720]  that you keep you swear by the Bible and then you keep saying that people are
[43:18.720 --> 43:22.720]  inherently wicked the Bible tells you that a group of people inherently wicked
[43:22.720 --> 43:26.720]  it tells you that a third of man and the children of the devil and it tells you
[43:26.720 --> 43:31.720]  that Edomites he hates them he hates them the Bible says that Jacob of my love
[43:31.720 --> 43:36.720]  but he saw how I hate it so what are you telling me you're not going by the Bible
[43:36.720 --> 43:40.720]  you're going by your own thoughts and then there's well that's your interpretation
[43:40.720 --> 43:44.720]  of it and then there's the whole debate about what it said we mean my interpretation
[43:44.720 --> 43:49.720]  well number one I get up here and I talk about people coming together against
[43:49.720 --> 43:54.720]  corruption people getting back to a rule of law and let me explain something
[43:54.720 --> 43:58.720]  the United States has never been perfect but it's because we had the power and the
[43:58.720 --> 44:02.720]  wealth because we had more liberty on average than other nations that such
[44:02.720 --> 44:06.720]  wealth was created so the new order took over this country and has used it as
[44:06.720 --> 44:13.720]  an engine of the new world order and you need to judge a tree by its fruits
[44:13.720 --> 44:18.720]  I mean look at look there is evil all across the world in every group right
[44:18.720 --> 44:23.720]  you know the wicked by their fruits right absolutely and you can look at the
[44:23.720 --> 44:28.720]  fruits all over the world man Indians killing the Indians absolutely absolutely
[44:28.720 --> 44:33.720]  the whole world absolutely well let me you man come on hold on you just made
[44:33.720 --> 44:37.720]  another statement as you just say the Native Americans were easy to conquer
[44:37.720 --> 44:42.720]  because they were they would literally come and say hire us to go kill these guys
[44:42.720 --> 44:45.720]  and then share some of their land with us they were just like the white men
[44:45.720 --> 44:49.720]  they just weren't as well organized they were tribal and so they wanted to
[44:49.720 --> 44:53.720]  settle old scores with the next drive and so through divide and conquer the
[44:53.720 --> 44:57.720]  British model they dominated the North American continent
[44:57.720 --> 45:02.720]  they weren't they were not just like the white men alright people really just like
[45:02.720 --> 45:07.720]  the Bible says people people um take part in the the fornication of the
[45:07.720 --> 45:13.720]  of the devil you know I mean they get that structure as is um is not in my
[45:13.720 --> 45:17.720]  head right now but basically it says we all took part in the wine of the
[45:17.720 --> 45:22.720]  wine of the fornication of this of Babylon the great so it's just like the
[45:22.720 --> 45:26.720]  Indians were seduced everyone else was seduced everyone even when now in
[45:26.720 --> 45:30.720]  Jamaica man couple years ago they would kill a gay guy if he was openly gay
[45:30.720 --> 45:34.720]  okay but now now it's all acceptable but nobody could tell you they should be
[45:34.720 --> 45:40.720]  stoned to death come on man America is Babylon the great is the Jesus
[45:40.720 --> 45:45.720]  didn't didn't Jesus didn't stone Mary Magdalene
[45:45.720 --> 45:50.720]  but you know what he said Matthew 10 verse 34 he said sing not that I come
[45:50.720 --> 45:56.720]  to bring peace I come to bring a sword he's coming to bring war and division
[45:56.720 --> 46:00.720]  okay he's not here for peace he's not coming to bring you're not gonna make
[46:00.720 --> 46:04.720]  peace with the devil man and wicked people isn't that what the Bible says
[46:04.720 --> 46:08.720]  well I'm just telling you that there you have to read the whole of it and there's
[46:08.720 --> 46:14.720]  a lot of nuances and you can interpret it however you want well I guess that's
[46:14.720 --> 46:19.720]  them that's how do you know how do you know you're you're right about being
[46:19.720 --> 46:25.720]  that the chosen people how do I know because the prophecies in the Bible
[46:25.720 --> 46:30.720]  tells you in Deuteronomy it tells you exactly that fact that's thank you for
[46:30.720 --> 46:34.720]  saying that how do I know I'm the chosen people these people in Israel these
[46:34.720 --> 46:40.720]  gutter rats calling themselves Jews when the Bible says we won't be there until
[46:40.720 --> 46:46.720]  yet the Lord Son comes back and bring us there sure listen listen I gotta be I
[46:46.720 --> 46:50.720]  gotta be fair to the other collars I've given you about 10 minutes and this is
[46:50.720 --> 46:54.720]  what I'm talking about I put people to head the line that disagree so you can
[46:54.720 --> 47:01.720]  hear it and because it's interesting and informative but I mean it's pointless
[47:01.720 --> 47:07.720]  it this whole argument this whole debate I'm gonna continue to expose evil I'm
[47:07.720 --> 47:13.720]  gonna continue to expose corruption and because King Solomon took a wife from
[47:13.720 --> 47:19.720]  Ethiopia you know then we get this whole extrapolation out that and I've had
[47:19.720 --> 47:22.720]  plenty of black people come by me when I'm at restaurants or whatever I grew up
[47:22.720 --> 47:27.720]  in Dallas and you know but I don't judge then all black folks because I was
[47:27.720 --> 47:35.720]  called a honky or more than 15 times I had groups of blacks attack me in Dallas
[47:35.720 --> 47:41.720]  and you know what that made me stronger okay that which does not kill you only
[47:41.720 --> 47:44.720]  makes you stronger and I don't hate black people because I've been called
[47:44.720 --> 47:53.720]  cracker and honky and that hit upside the head by brick and I fight so that the
[47:53.720 --> 47:58.720]  new world order doesn't carry out its eugenics against black folks okay and
[47:58.720 --> 48:02.720]  this is a very wicked ideology the new world order has that ideology that you
[48:02.720 --> 48:06.720]  know they're the mayor of engine line you know the secret line and all of
[48:06.720 --> 48:09.720]  this and this is what makes the world go around and you got every group saying
[48:09.720 --> 48:16.720]  they are the chosen people and you had Jesus who said you know they are the
[48:16.720 --> 48:20.720]  synagogue of Satan there are those that call themselves Jews or not just he was
[48:20.720 --> 48:26.720]  talking about the Pharisees the Sadducees the who had overturned the Levitical
[48:26.720 --> 48:37.720]  Law from Mount Sinai and Moses and who had forsaken the Torah because they'd
[48:37.720 --> 48:43.720]  been in captivity in Babylon and they had come back with the Babylon mystery
[48:43.720 --> 48:50.720]  teachings and were teaching of that as Judaism now were the twelve tribes
[48:50.720 --> 48:56.720]  diverse did the twelve tribes go in different parts of the world I mean are
[48:56.720 --> 49:03.720]  there Hebrew standing stones in England and in Canada and in Minnesota did the
[49:03.720 --> 49:08.720]  Vikings not have that in some of their language yes absolutely I mean that's
[49:08.720 --> 49:15.720]  what Russian means is rooster or or or red or or the north the north men I
[49:15.720 --> 49:20.720]  mean you talk about evidence and so you have this diversity of people in the
[49:20.720 --> 49:25.720]  Mediterranean area in trade to the fjords the rivers across Europe into
[49:25.720 --> 49:32.720]  Central Asia and they've dug up you know Viking settlements north settlements in
[49:32.720 --> 49:41.720]  northern China in western China in Mongolia so we are all interrelated and I
[49:41.720 --> 49:45.720]  am not going to partake of the whole white supremacist ideology and I'm not
[49:45.720 --> 49:53.720]  going to take part in the exploding black Israelite movement okay now I will try
[49:53.720 --> 49:59.720]  to keep the HIV virus out of the shots and I will try to defend little black
[49:59.720 --> 50:03.720]  children little white children little red children okay we'll come back and

[53:45.920 --> 53:52.720]  ever reach that goal? I don't know. But I know this. We better work for it. But we're
[53:52.720 --> 54:01.240]  going to destroy ourselves. There's so much denial. You know, it's all over mainstream
[54:01.240 --> 54:05.080]  European and Chinese press that Iran corporations pushing Pentagon to run sneak attacks against
[54:05.080 --> 54:12.160]  Russia or China. We restart the economy. We saw two months ago a sneak attack on a Russian
[54:12.160 --> 54:19.920]  enclave, by NATO back forces, via Georgia. So a lot of evidence backs this up. People
[54:19.920 --> 54:24.520]  ask me, what are you doing putting out Chinese propaganda? We're just reporting on what is
[54:24.520 --> 54:30.200]  big news in China. Again, nitpicking. Would you rather us not tell you this is being debated
[54:30.200 --> 54:34.760]  and discussed? We're just here to put out the information. You can judge it for yourself,
[54:34.760 --> 54:38.320]  look into it for yourself. We ask you to. And to decide what you want to do.
[54:38.320 --> 54:41.640]  All right, here's the deal. I said I want to take a lot of calls today and we are. And
[54:41.640 --> 54:45.520]  I've only taken two in the last hour because each calls, you know, on four or five minutes
[54:45.520 --> 54:49.880]  and one calls on about four minutes. Other calls on about 10. I want to really try to
[54:49.880 --> 54:55.520]  get to everybody here. Walton, Michigan, you're on at the air. Go ahead, Walt.
[54:55.520 --> 55:02.600]  Hello, Eric. By the way, my name's Eric. I'm sorry. Excuse me. I have that on my mind
[55:02.600 --> 55:07.760]  because that's why I called. My name is Walt Williams, by the way. That's my whole name.
[55:07.760 --> 55:12.280]  I'm not afraid to say it. And I'm calling you and I'm hoping that you won't put me on
[55:12.280 --> 55:16.840]  hold and let me respond to what you say. I know you've called before. Every time I call
[55:16.840 --> 55:22.440]  him on hold again, I let you call. I know who you are. I think you're the guy that pushes
[55:22.440 --> 55:27.800]  the person that lies about me and says, I work for the Vatican and I will not sit here
[55:27.800 --> 55:33.720]  and make money for and promote somebody that lies about me with once an abandon. Now, now,
[55:33.720 --> 55:38.720]  now, if you've got any issues you want to say about the Catholic church or any expose
[55:38.720 --> 55:42.480]  as you want to do, go ahead. But if you want to come on my show and promote somebody that's
[55:42.480 --> 55:50.920]  a liar, it isn't going to happen, sir. Now, go ahead. Mars attacked him on your show the
[55:50.920 --> 55:58.280]  other day without naming him. I'm done. I'm done talking to you. Okay. Okay. It is not
[55:58.280 --> 56:05.320]  going to happen on my show. There are a few people out there who have told you just incredible
[56:05.320 --> 56:12.680]  lies about me and I'm not going to again. This whole show is turning into Alex Jones.
[56:12.680 --> 56:18.440]  Okay. Look, you bear false witness. You promote people that do. Don't expect this as a platform
[56:18.440 --> 56:24.960]  for you. Okay. Go tell your lies about me. Go right ahead. I know it upsets you when
[56:24.960 --> 56:29.560]  I expose the Vatican because then it heaps calls on you and you know, you promote a
[56:29.560 --> 56:37.480]  charlatan. Ryan in Wisconsin, you're on the air. Go ahead. Don't try to move quicker
[56:37.480 --> 56:43.080]  here. Go ahead, Ryan. He just dropped. Okay. James in Oklahoma. Go ahead, James. Hey,
[56:43.080 --> 56:48.360]  Alex. Hi. I got a question for you. It's about organized malicious. Okay. I know you've
[56:48.360 --> 56:56.240]  had a lot of calls to the contrary today. My question is how I live in Oklahoma. I live
[56:56.240 --> 57:01.680]  in a very rural spot. I live about 20 miles from the nearest town. My question is how
[57:01.680 --> 57:09.880]  do I inform people that I'm starting a militia? Well, it's a very complex issue. It's extremely
[57:09.880 --> 57:15.600]  nuanced and because I mean, I've looked all over the net. There's nothing. I mean, there's
[57:15.600 --> 57:24.840]  a lot of people that have militias on the net, but nothing to promote them. I tell you what,
[57:24.840 --> 57:32.520]  we're going to break and I'm going to come back to you and then we're going to I'll spend
[57:32.520 --> 57:38.560]  a few minutes giving you the basic boil down of my view on malicious. It's very, very, very
[57:38.560 --> 57:43.680]  important. It's part of our country. I support it, but it's also one of the most dangerous
[57:43.680 --> 58:00.680]  things you can be involved in. It'll be right back.
[58:00.680 --> 58:17.160]  I've come with a message of information. Not 11 was an inside job. You like being a puppet,
[58:17.160 --> 58:29.160]  sir. You like being a puppet for the new world order. I'll do the American people know that
[58:29.160 --> 58:39.240]  it's taking place. An inside job. How dare you? If you know that there's treason going
[58:39.240 --> 58:43.560]  on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself. All hell is breaking loose on 6th
[58:43.560 --> 58:48.560]  Avenue. The government has not told the truth in five years. We will be here on the 10th
[58:48.560 --> 58:54.280]  anniversary of the rise. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD

[59:02.240 --> 59:16.640]  on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. Big brother. Mainstream media. Government
[59:16.640 --> 59:25.360]  cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[59:25.360 --> 59:31.880]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. I've opened phones. I'd love to talk about
[59:31.880 --> 59:35.600]  the banker takeover bill and how they're looting everything and openly saying they're giving
[59:35.600 --> 59:42.600]  most of the money to themselves as bonuses. The election, the poisoning of the population,
[59:42.600 --> 59:51.840]  the water and food supply, all of it. 1-800-25-99231. But briefly, James Oklahoma was saying, basically
[59:51.840 --> 59:57.080]  he wants to form a militia or he wants to get involved with one. Let me explain this
[59:57.080 --> 1:00:05.040]  in the founding of this country. When settlers came into the Eastern area, they set up local
[1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:12.960]  defense groups for their towns, their tiny hamlets in their cities. Those were called
[1:00:12.960 --> 1:00:16.000]  militias. And they had innumerable wars with the natives and with the French and back and
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:23.880]  forth. And then the standing militia, the unorganized militia, two different types were
[1:00:23.880 --> 1:00:29.160]  instrumental in defeating the British in that eight-year war with guerilla warfare. Now,
[1:00:29.160 --> 1:00:34.960]  the feds claim today there is no lawfully constituted militia by the individual citizens
[1:00:34.960 --> 1:00:39.880]  or the posse or the civil defense that only the National Guard is militia and they say
[1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:45.000]  only the National Guard existed. Well, that's not true. It was set up in 1906. All the major
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  jurors prudence the records show that every man 18 to 44 is a member of the militia to
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  be called out by the sheriff, the county, the governor. Now, Switzerland has the same thing.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:03.160]  Every able-bodied man can be called out. He has to have a gun by law. They've demonized
[1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:07.680]  that. Now, they try to prosecute just like they used to do in England, starting in England.
[1:01:07.680 --> 1:01:11.760]  Anybody, you know, you shoot somebody in your house, they come arrest you in many states.
[1:01:11.760 --> 1:01:17.820]  You stab somebody, you're trying to rape you, you go to jail. You know, a criminal falls
[1:01:17.820 --> 1:01:24.000]  through your skylight, your sky window, and breaks their back. They sue you. It's all
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:28.320]  about training you that you can't defend yourself. So, I'm all for militias. I think
[1:01:28.320 --> 1:01:32.200]  people, you know, should call it, you know, neighborhood defense league or whatever because
[1:01:32.200 --> 1:01:39.160]  the enemy has demonized that name. And I watched hundreds and hundreds of people in the 90s
[1:01:39.160 --> 1:01:43.120]  as they saw the new order taking over being set up. They would go for militias. They do
[1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:47.720]  training and they'd send feds into them. They'd bury pipe bombs on their property. They would
[1:01:47.720 --> 1:01:51.520]  get them to shoot their mouths off at a campfire and then arrest everybody. You know, they're
[1:01:51.520 --> 1:01:56.480]  doing it to the Muslim groups now, too, and other groups. It comes out every day. It came
[1:01:56.480 --> 1:02:00.420]  out. They associated and pressed what two days ago that the informant was leading the
[1:02:00.420 --> 1:02:04.280]  Muslim group, went out and found the young Muslims, got them to talk about carrying out
[1:02:04.280 --> 1:02:11.120]  violence. Feds were leading this white supremacist group, got them talking about doing violence.
[1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:21.360]  The black Israelite group out of Miami two years ago, back in June of 2006, over a year,
[1:02:21.360 --> 1:02:26.560]  the FBI gave them over $150,000, six different guys. A couple of them were mentally retarded,
[1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:31.120]  the kids got them to talk about how they were going to attack the federal building, paid
[1:02:31.120 --> 1:02:35.240]  them to videotape the federal building. It was all made up. But on the news, black army
[1:02:35.240 --> 1:02:41.520]  to kill everybody, black army was going to blow up the capital and blow up DC and nationwide
[1:02:41.520 --> 1:02:45.680]  death and people were, but then a week later it was admitted and they had to drop it all.
[1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:49.800]  Basically, it was all staged. Or the feds deliver, you know, in Canada, the Mounties
[1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:56.000]  delivered ammonium nitrate to the door of some Muslim teenagers. I mean, it's provocaturing
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:00.640]  to get the basic headline to fear monger everybody. So that's what's going on there.
[1:03:00.640 --> 1:03:06.360]  And so the militia, you know, organized a bunch of guys out in the woods. I mean, I'm
[1:03:06.360 --> 1:03:09.560]  not going to get my listeners in trouble. I'm just going to tell you, it's a very dangerous
[1:03:09.560 --> 1:03:13.240]  thing to get involved with because there's more feds in there provocaturing than you
[1:03:13.240 --> 1:03:17.440]  can shake a stick at. But should you get together with friends and families and neighbors and
[1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:22.240]  having to, you know, agreed on plan of defense of yourselves? Yes. But it isn't going to
[1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:26.720]  come like that like red dawn. It's going to be shut the power off. Engineer riots have
[1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:31.800]  the public bag for militarization. Does that answer your question, James?
[1:03:31.800 --> 1:03:37.040]  Kind of, but yeah, but that's just the thing. If they shut the power off or shut the water
[1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:43.880]  off, we're ready. I mean, it's not going to be like, I understand it's not going to be
[1:03:43.880 --> 1:03:49.800]  like red dawn, but that's just it. I want to be able to respond to similar, of similar
[1:03:49.800 --> 1:03:54.600]  nature. You know what I mean? Yes, we'll come back to you and give you a few minutes on
[1:03:54.600 --> 1:03:58.040]  the other side to finish up your statements because I was on a diet for answering your
[1:03:58.040 --> 1:04:05.240]  question. Then we'll go to everybody else that is patiently holding Charles Lamar,
[1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:11.160]  West, Van and others. Stay with us. Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you
[1:04:11.160 --> 1:04:15.520]  for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever.
[1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:19.400]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in
[1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:23.680]  a red line if you have your own bread. You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for
[1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:28.640]  FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare. Our elected representatives
[1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:32.760]  wanted a good old boy bailout for a special interest, so they ignored your screams not
[1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:37.760]  to do it. They turned off the telephones and email. They voted to print $850 billion at
[1:04:37.760 --> 1:04:42.560]  least out of thin air. This money now owns the American and European banks. The exploding
[1:04:42.560 --> 1:04:46.960]  inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the
[1:04:46.960 --> 1:04:52.240]  cost of massacres, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach. In pre-Nazi Germany's
[1:04:52.240 --> 1:04:56.840]  superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over
[1:04:56.840 --> 1:05:01.720]  4 billion marks. Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no
[1:05:01.720 --> 1:05:06.280]  end in sight. The private banks, merging with our government, are refusing to loan grocery
[1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:10.520]  stores enough money to restock their shelves. The stores have less food, but jack up prices
[1:05:10.520 --> 1:05:15.280]  to stay in business. Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready. Everything
[1:05:15.280 --> 1:05:19.600]  is zeroing and on food. One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying
[1:05:19.600 --> 1:05:24.400]  for other necessities. My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient,
[1:05:24.400 --> 1:05:27.800]  get food. For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand
[1:05:27.800 --> 1:05:31.480]  that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order has a lot less
[1:05:31.480 --> 1:05:36.480]  control over you, and so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[1:05:36.480 --> 1:05:41.120]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you. You know eFoodsDirect.com
[1:05:41.120 --> 1:05:45.600]  is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella genetic alteration

[1:06:41.480 --> 1:06:46.760]  Tonda News and phone calls coming up this hour. Kevin Booth, the maker of American Drug War,
[1:06:46.760 --> 1:06:54.160]  which has really made a big effect on cable TV, will be joining us to talk about the election
[1:06:54.160 --> 1:07:04.280]  and a lot more. James in Oklahoma is talking about how to form militias, why to form militias.
[1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:15.920]  Go ahead, sir.
[1:07:15.920 --> 1:07:42.680]  Well, a lot of times corrupt systems collapse of their own accord. The thing is, I don't
[1:07:42.680 --> 1:07:50.480]  really see it when they come to take the guns, which Obama will probably do, and more than
[1:07:50.480 --> 1:07:57.840]  likely he'll be our next president. I know a lot of people that won't give him up. A
[1:07:57.840 --> 1:08:04.200]  lot of people. I mean, yeah, we're probably red necks, whatever you want to call us.
[1:08:04.200 --> 1:08:09.320]  Well, let's bring this up, and I'm not saying it's an insurmountable enemy, but what are
[1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:18.000]  you going to do if they release a deadly bioweapon that kills 30 million people? No, no, I understand.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:23.720]  My point is, I think people underestimate just how ruthless the globalist are. The whole
[1:08:23.720 --> 1:08:31.720]  police state is just a grid, a straight jacket, to tie us down while they chop us up in pieces.
[1:08:31.720 --> 1:08:36.520]  So people need to understand they're going to stage even bigger things in the future
[1:08:36.520 --> 1:08:46.360]  deposes the saviors. I mean, it's kind of like, do you sit on your hands or not? I mean,
[1:08:46.360 --> 1:08:52.080]  people got to wake up. That's basically all there is to it. If they don't, it's our undoing.
[1:08:52.080 --> 1:09:00.840]  I mean, and that's why I asked the question I asked. Well, the international bankers don't
[1:09:00.840 --> 1:09:05.960]  like nations with large middle classes, and so they like to take them down, put dictators
[1:09:05.960 --> 1:09:13.040]  in and kill 20, 30% of the population, and they are planning that here. The government
[1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:20.800]  is completely rogue, totally criminal from top to bottom, and is just rotting. The best
[1:09:20.800 --> 1:09:26.800]  we can hope for is just a collapse of the system, and it looks like things aren't going
[1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:30.880]  well for the new aborder, and that may just happen. Well, let me ask you this. Oklahoma,
[1:09:30.880 --> 1:09:36.400]  they more or less told the federal government to cease and desist when they passed that.
[1:09:36.400 --> 1:09:40.160]  Well, they passed that in 94, so the feds bombed them. Exactly. And then they passed
[1:09:40.160 --> 1:09:45.040]  it again this year. No, no, listen, don't think we're the only ones that know this. There
[1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:49.600]  are people everywhere that know. That's why waking the people up, letting them know the
[1:09:49.600 --> 1:09:55.640]  bad guys are in control, just passively not going along, passively knowing they're a bunch
[1:09:55.640 --> 1:10:00.680]  of dirtbag crooks, that will beat them. You know, we don't have to have some big resounding
[1:10:00.680 --> 1:10:05.880]  victory like the running man, with Arnold Schwarzenegger running in and the whole country
[1:10:05.880 --> 1:10:13.440]  saved because of one national TV program. It's going to be a process. I mean, a lot
[1:10:13.440 --> 1:10:17.080]  of people in government have got to ask themselves, you've lived in denial, you've denied everything
[1:10:17.080 --> 1:10:20.720]  we told you, even though it was right out of government documents, now it's all happening.
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:25.040]  Do you understand you're destroying your own future? You know, I mean, I saw a guy at a
[1:10:25.040 --> 1:10:29.720]  gas station getting out of his federal car yesterday with this big, you know, federal
[1:10:29.720 --> 1:10:35.920]  eagle on the back of his black shirt and staring everybody on a big power trip. Those guys
[1:10:35.920 --> 1:10:42.200]  are a mile wide and inch deep. And it's their, it's their shallowness is what makes them
[1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:45.480]  so dangerous. They have no idea who they're working for. They have no idea what they're
[1:10:45.480 --> 1:10:51.200]  involved in. They have no idea how expendable they are, but they will find out and then
[1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:54.560]  they will laugh and giggle now. But as things get worse and worse, they won't laugh and
[1:10:54.560 --> 1:10:59.980]  giggle anymore. It's like all of them that came before them. You know, these green horns
[1:10:59.980 --> 1:11:08.200]  in all of this in the system aren't concerned. They're elegant. Just like a lot of these
[1:11:08.200 --> 1:11:12.520]  new soldiers that go into combat, when their leg or arm gets blown off, you know, they're
[1:11:12.520 --> 1:11:17.920]  real tough, but when their arm or leg gets blown off and they see, they see their guts
[1:11:17.920 --> 1:11:30.080]  all over the wall, they start crying for mommy. So I don't, all I can do is tell the truth
[1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:34.520]  and warn people and let the chips fall where they may, but we have the people that funded
[1:11:34.520 --> 1:11:40.680]  Hitler, Stalin, Mao running the country right now. And they mean to kill, I'd say one out
[1:11:40.680 --> 1:11:44.640]  of three people. You look at three people on the street, they, they plan to at least
[1:11:44.640 --> 1:11:48.440]  kill one of those three people. Let me ask you this. When do you think that this is all
[1:11:48.440 --> 1:11:53.920]  going to come down in the next year or two? It's a process and they're behind schedule.
[1:11:53.920 --> 1:11:56.760]  They would have already staged more terror attacks, but we exposed that they were behind
[1:11:56.760 --> 1:12:00.560]  it. So that really took that bag of tricks away from them. It's now mainstream news.
[1:12:00.560 --> 1:12:05.840]  They staged terror attacks. People, the majority of the public, you know, say, well, of course,
[1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:10.120]  everybody knows that the majority of people know the government ships in the drugs. The
[1:12:10.120 --> 1:12:13.640]  people now know that the private banks are looting everything and that they're becoming
[1:12:13.640 --> 1:12:20.840]  the government. So, but again, the establishments gone too far. They can't turn back now. They
[1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:25.920]  know they're exposed. They know their criminal operation is, is, is out in the open. And
[1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:30.920]  so I don't know. I mean, they could do anything detonate nukes and blame it on a foreign country.
[1:12:30.920 --> 1:12:37.640]  We know that's in their bag of tricks. That's in the cards, bio weapons, chemical weapons.
[1:12:37.640 --> 1:12:43.400]  I mean, they snuck attack Russia two months ago out of a clear blue sky. These people
[1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:47.760]  are capable of anything. NATO came out and said things that were never said during the
[1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:52.320]  Cold War. They said, we may preemptively nuke Russia and Russian generals get literally
[1:12:52.320 --> 1:12:56.240]  had the blood go out of their faces and went on TV and said, why are you doing this? I
[1:12:56.240 --> 1:13:03.080]  mean, this is serious folks. The new world order is blood hungry. They're blood thirsty.
[1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:09.560]  They're just crazed on power trips. And listen, I appreciate your call. I gotta, I gotta move
[1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:15.200]  on here. James, good talking to you. Charles in California, then Lamar West and others.
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:22.080]  Hey, hey, Lord Jones. How you doing? Good. I'm sorry. I like to add FL, FL you owe to
[1:13:22.080 --> 1:13:27.200]  people's names these days, you know, because everyone's so poison. But I love being part
[1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:33.680]  of this movement. And I appreciate that you got me hooked on to the E. Colo blue month
[1:13:33.680 --> 1:13:38.680]  and a half ago or whatever it was. I was looking for a way to, you know, not drink poison.
[1:13:38.680 --> 1:13:45.160]  I got that now. Um, yeah, Ventura saw the Willie Nelson's air of water from air filter
[1:13:45.160 --> 1:13:50.840]  and just absolutely loved it. Yeah, I saw those pictures. It was pretty cool. Um, if
[1:13:50.840 --> 1:13:57.880]  I may, I'd like to make a few points. Uh, one thing you mentioned heroes. Um, I watched
[1:13:57.880 --> 1:14:03.800]  that show, you know, one of the few things I do watch on the program. But, um, I searched
[1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:06.880]  it into Google because I wanted to see if people were talking about it, you know, how
[1:14:06.880 --> 1:14:13.040]  we mentioned the world order or whatever. Uh, it happens to be that the show after that,
[1:14:13.040 --> 1:14:17.720]  the first 15 minutes in the show after that, I'm not sure if you saw this, but also mentioned
[1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:22.720]  the world order that my own worst enemy or whatever, we're Christians later 15 minutes
[1:14:22.720 --> 1:14:27.800]  into that show. Same way it was 15 minutes into heroes mentioned new world order too.
[1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:32.040]  Yeah, let me explain. They call it product placement. But when the government does it,
[1:14:32.040 --> 1:14:38.980]  I call it propaganda placement. Here's an example of that movie anger management. I
[1:14:38.980 --> 1:14:43.520]  forget the exact number. I want to say $4 million. You can pull it up and go on from
[1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:51.840]  memory that the Pentagon paid just to have pro army messages in the movie. And so yes,
[1:14:51.840 --> 1:14:56.560]  they're paying to acclimate everyone. They're now openly merging the US with the European
[1:14:56.560 --> 1:15:02.800]  Union. That's all been announced. The banks are openly setting up world government and
[1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:08.680]  they just need to now tell the public. And so it's, it's all part of acclimation.
[1:15:08.680 --> 1:15:18.200]  Yeah. Um, also, I wanted to ask you a couple more things. Uh, my friend recently is reading
[1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:24.680]  these books or whatever of Kurt Vonoggan, Jr. You've heard of him. He must be in the
[1:15:24.680 --> 1:15:28.880]  same category as like George Orwell, huh? Being like involved with some intelligence.
[1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:32.320]  Supposedly he was like an engineer of general electric. My friend said, I was like, Oh,
[1:15:32.320 --> 1:15:39.560]  there you go. General Electric's like, isn't that the company that whatever like owns the
[1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:44.800]  media and everything? Well, Kurt Vonoggan was a great guy and he died. Um, was it earlier
[1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:54.120]  this year or last year? Um, maybe last year. Well, out of the blue, I got contacted by
[1:15:54.120 --> 1:16:01.960]  his partner and, uh, I want to get him on Joe Petro and he contacted me, I guess about
[1:16:01.960 --> 1:16:06.640]  three years ago and he said, Kurt has seen some of your videos. He just wants to thank
[1:16:06.640 --> 1:16:13.920]  you and he wants your address, uh, to send you something. And, uh, then I got a letter
[1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:19.360]  from Kurt Vonoggan. And then also we put this on the web, a little framed, uh, painting
[1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:26.360]  he did that, uh, you know, says to Alex on it from Kurt Vonoggan and it's a birdcage
[1:16:26.360 --> 1:16:34.000]  with the door open. And Kurt did know that 9-11 was an inside job before he died. Um,
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:40.960]  I guess about memory serves about 10 months ago, but I'll look it up and, uh, I, uh, talked
[1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:45.280]  to him, but I'm not going to go any more detail than that. We talked to him and he just was
[1:16:45.280 --> 1:16:49.600]  like, basically, look, I'm too old. I'm done. Cause about two years ago he gave a speech
[1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:54.080]  at a university, his alma mater and then said, I won't be back. But no, he wasn't a new world
[1:16:54.080 --> 1:16:59.920]  order guy. He was a smart guy and he had been a, uh, prisoner of war. What was it? Shot
[1:16:59.920 --> 1:17:06.680]  down, uh, in Germany. And then he'd been, uh, in bombing raids, you know, having the
[1:17:06.680 --> 1:17:10.960]  base he was kept in. They were keeping him in an old slaughterhouse bombed. So he wrote
[1:17:10.960 --> 1:17:19.200]  slaughterhouse fives with the sirens of Titan. And, uh, so I, I, I didn't really hammer him
[1:17:19.200 --> 1:17:23.560]  or push him to get Kurt Vonoggan on, but Kurt Vonoggan was a great guy.
[1:17:23.560 --> 1:17:27.880]  It clearly was very educated because the things my friend's telling me, it's just like, wow,
[1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:31.440]  you know, it's like everything he, he was a lot of the things he wrote about were just
[1:17:31.440 --> 1:17:36.720]  all like China, you know, tell people. But, um, also I just thought the other day about
[1:17:36.720 --> 1:17:40.040]  the, um, you know, that Obama gun incident thing where they were going to kill him or
[1:17:40.040 --> 1:17:46.240]  whatever, supposedly, um, is it possible that that was, what, what do you, what's your take
[1:17:46.240 --> 1:17:51.080]  on that personal? You think that was set up or what do you think?
[1:17:51.080 --> 1:17:56.400]  We always find out a year, six months down the road, but they've done many of those provocateur
[1:17:56.400 --> 1:18:02.520]  actions where they find these mentally ill people normally below 20 who love to shoot
[1:18:02.520 --> 1:18:06.680]  their mouths off on the web. And then the feds provocateur them into making more boastful
[1:18:06.680 --> 1:18:12.080]  claims. And the whole thing was, you know, ridiculous how big it was, what they were
[1:18:12.080 --> 1:18:16.920]  planning, the stupid top hats and white tuxedos. So yeah, I think it was staged.
[1:18:16.920 --> 1:18:20.680]  Honey, have you seen the remote? Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[1:18:20.680 --> 1:18:22.960]  I can't find my wallet.

[1:21:16.320 --> 1:21:21.680]  I am so frustrated. I can't seem to remember anything anymore. What? Seriously, my memory
[1:21:21.680 --> 1:21:26.280]  and attention span is terrible. I read something and forget. I forget people's names. I hear
[1:21:26.280 --> 1:21:30.560]  all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people, but I forget. Okay,
[1:21:30.560 --> 1:21:35.360]  slow down. Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault. Factors like fluoride in
[1:21:35.360 --> 1:21:40.760]  the water, aluminum and deodorants, genetically modified foods, the way the education system
[1:21:40.760 --> 1:21:44.840]  taught you. It's all meant to dumb you down. You know, I can remember everything now, even
[1:21:44.840 --> 1:21:50.440]  entire books. What? How? There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory. Their online
[1:21:50.440 --> 1:21:55.080]  course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement. In fact, they guarantee

[1:22:14.120 --> 1:22:43.960]  pmemory.net. It happens throughout history over and over again and it's happening to us.
[1:22:43.960 --> 1:22:49.700]  I just happen to have high technology and a lot of brainwashed people that have witnessed
[1:22:49.700 --> 1:22:54.800]  millions of simulated murders on television who have been dead into violence and torture.
[1:22:54.800 --> 1:23:03.840]  A lot of self-centered people on power trips working for a great agency of evil. Using
[1:23:03.840 --> 1:23:08.920]  social engineering to just tear our society, our families apart. Whether you like it or
[1:23:08.920 --> 1:23:13.600]  not, for those of you that serve the system, you are with the people. You've just eluded
[1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:16.840]  yourself to think that you're doing good or that you're safe or that everything's going
[1:23:16.840 --> 1:23:27.520]  to be okay. Let's go ahead now and talk to Lamar in Maryland. You're on the air, Lamar.
[1:23:27.520 --> 1:23:35.760]  Hello. Hi. How you doing? Good. First time caller. Yeah, I have some information for
[1:23:35.760 --> 1:23:46.320]  you. It was about Congress. Yes. It was on a radio I heard. It was on Google. I mean,
[1:23:46.320 --> 1:23:51.680]  not Google, but YouTube. It was about the 10 steps they were going to do before they
[1:23:51.680 --> 1:23:59.280]  bought the new world or the martial law. Are you talking about the video of Naomi Wolfe
[1:23:59.280 --> 1:24:05.600]  or is it actually Congress up there talking? It was a Congress and it was a secret meeting.
[1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:10.960]  And they got a leak. It was on certain radio things. I don't know if you got it. You might
[1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:15.120]  already know because I know you get a lot of information. I know who one of the radio
[1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:21.680]  hosts was, a very questionable source, but we know open martial law is being implemented.
[1:24:21.680 --> 1:24:26.240]  I mean, they've taken the safety off of the gun to America's head, telling Congress we'll
[1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:31.880]  declare martial law, activating army brigades, not just one, but many. I mean, we're under
[1:24:31.880 --> 1:24:37.320]  martial law right now. 95% of the public doesn't want to bail out. They do it. 90 plus percent
[1:24:37.320 --> 1:24:42.120]  want to control the borders. They still don't do it. 75 to 80% don't want the war. They
[1:24:42.120 --> 1:24:47.080]  do it. I mean, that is martial law right there. The government follows whatever laws it wants,
[1:24:47.080 --> 1:24:51.760]  doesn't follow other laws. The private banks are stealing anything and everything that's
[1:24:51.760 --> 1:24:59.960]  even bolted down. So we're in martial law. Can I play a little bit of it for you? I don't
[1:24:59.960 --> 1:25:05.280]  know if we can hit. I think I've seen it, but go ahead about it, Eric. Okay. We very
[1:25:05.280 --> 1:25:13.840]  few, I might add. We're so shocked, so horrified, so furious and concerned about the future
[1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:20.480]  of America by what was revealed to them inside the secret meeting. Well, folks may have started
[1:25:20.480 --> 1:25:26.640]  to leak the secret information to independent news agencies around the world. The mass media
[1:25:26.640 --> 1:25:32.560]  said almost nothing, which is not a surprise, about the secret meeting of the House. Mentioning
[1:25:32.560 --> 1:25:39.280]  only one of the items that was being discussed. The new surveillance techniques that are going
[1:25:39.280 --> 1:25:43.280]  to be used by the US government. Yeah, you know, people are saying a nuke's going to
[1:25:43.280 --> 1:25:48.480]  go off November 13th. People said that last week a giant flying saucer was going to go
[1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:55.960]  flying over Alabama. And again, the Houston Chronicle, all of their papers admit they
[1:25:55.960 --> 1:25:59.880]  built FEMA camps for the American people. You can go to urban warfare drills and witness
[1:25:59.880 --> 1:26:04.760]  the troops training for war with the American people. You can read the Army Times where
[1:26:04.760 --> 1:26:11.400]  they say it's for fighting the American people. You can watch videos all over local newscast
[1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:17.680]  on YouTube, all over the country, and police working with the military. So, but, but we
[1:26:17.680 --> 1:26:21.400]  make videos about that, but hardly anybody else does. And it's always, oh, what we heard
[1:26:21.400 --> 1:26:26.720]  from a source behind closed doors. We had a congressman, in fact, two congressmen on
[1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:32.960]  who did talk about how they were threatened with martial law. So that's confirmed.
[1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:42.280]  I mean, I'm not throwing out or poo pooing as they say what you're saying. Lamar, I'm
[1:26:42.280 --> 1:26:45.960]  simply saying I stick to what I can prove and I can't even get the public. I mean,
[1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:51.200]  not a year and a half ago, last thing we put an end game, we were finishing it. George
[1:26:51.200 --> 1:26:55.280]  Bush and Merkel and Barroso, the EU stood up there and said, we're merging the North
[1:26:55.280 --> 1:26:59.520]  American Union with the European Union. And I got the president saying that the public
[1:26:59.520 --> 1:27:07.160]  can't believe it. So, I mean, what do you do? What do you do? What do you do? And people
[1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:10.680]  and some people say, okay, well, that's the next step. You have no rights. You have no
[1:27:10.680 --> 1:27:15.920]  liberty. The Congress is signing over all this authority to foreign bodies, not just
[1:27:15.920 --> 1:27:22.240]  the executive and foreign corporations, like the World Trade Organization and the International
[1:27:22.240 --> 1:27:27.520]  Bank of Settlements. So, I don't understand the pension on the web, though, to always
[1:27:27.520 --> 1:27:31.600]  talk about this secret meeting or that secret meeting or what do we got from this source
[1:27:31.600 --> 1:27:35.480]  or what do we got from this source? It's all right out in the open. But very interesting.
[1:27:35.480 --> 1:27:42.840]  Now, I think I've seen that video clip, Lamar. Anything else? No, that's not it, man. Hey,
[1:27:42.840 --> 1:27:47.760]  in case I haven't seen it, email it to Aaronandinfowars.com and I'll take a look. But I appreciate
[1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:51.760]  you calling in with it, okay? All right. Thank you, Lamar. Great to have you as a first-time

[1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:23.000]  unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:29.040]  country. The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This
[1:29:29.040 --> 1:29:33.520]  is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled
[1:29:33.520 --> 1:29:37.920]  Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:29:37.920 --> 1:29:42.720]  networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis
[1:29:42.720 --> 1:29:49.480]  again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[1:29:49.480 --> 1:29:54.840]  have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[1:29:54.840 --> 1:29:59.040]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games,
[1:29:59.040 --> 1:30:04.880]  the shadow government and much, much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:30:04.880 --> 1:30:09.600]  Or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:30:09.600 --> 1:30:17.580]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[1:30:17.580 --> 1:30:20.880]  Would you walk around with your credit card number displayed on your back for anyone to
[1:30:20.880 --> 1:30:25.320]  read? Of course not. But if you have one of the 50 million new contactless credit and
[1:30:25.320 --> 1:30:29.440]  debit cards in circulation in your wallet, that's exactly what you're doing. I'm
[1:30:29.440 --> 1:30:33.840]  Wal Augustino, it's founder of Identity Stronghold, and we think this is information you need
[1:30:33.840 --> 1:30:37.840]  to know. You may not even realize you already have one of these cards, because they look
[1:30:37.840 --> 1:30:42.720]  physically just like the old card. The difference is an RFID chip hidden inside the card that
[1:30:42.720 --> 1:30:47.360]  makes radio communication with the card possible, right through your wallet, purse, or pants
[1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:51.480]  pocket without you ever removing the card. Pickpockets no longer even have to touch
[1:30:51.480 --> 1:30:56.680]  you to get your information. Our company realizes the privacy danger this represents, and that's
[1:30:56.680 --> 1:31:00.720]  why we manufacture the Secure Sleeve. The Secure Sleeve is a patent pending card sleeve
[1:31:00.720 --> 1:31:05.520]  that contains a radio frequency barrier preventing radio signals from reaching your card. You
[1:31:05.520 --> 1:31:10.600]  can get more information and purchase the Secure Sleeve online at idstronghold.com. That's
[1:31:10.600 --> 1:31:33.600]  idstronghold.com, or call us at 800-610-2770.
[1:31:33.600 --> 1:31:42.920]  And on WWCR, Shorewave, satellite, Internet 24-7, free podcast, pre-archives, streams,
[1:31:42.920 --> 1:31:51.640]  re-streaming, all up at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com. I want to go back to your calls
[1:31:51.640 --> 1:31:57.040]  in a moment, but I do need to start getting into some of all this important news that
[1:31:57.040 --> 1:32:01.320]  I have here in front of me as well, and it's gotten to the point where I may go a week
[1:32:01.320 --> 1:32:06.300]  now without even plugging my documentary films, books, and videos, other books and videos
[1:32:06.300 --> 1:32:13.120]  that we carry online at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com that link over to our Secure Online video
[1:32:13.120 --> 1:32:20.220]  and bookstore shopping cart. Remember, just because you are aware of the
[1:32:20.220 --> 1:32:22.960]  New World Order, just because you're aware of the North American Union, just because
[1:32:22.960 --> 1:32:27.680]  you're aware of the eugenesis that run the planet, the scientific dictatorship, doesn't
[1:32:27.680 --> 1:32:34.480]  mean your friends, your family, your neighbors are. And by the way, now people are more receptive
[1:32:34.480 --> 1:32:38.720]  to this information. You may have given people DVDs or films ten years ago that laughed
[1:32:38.720 --> 1:32:44.160]  at you, but a lot of you have run back into them and had them tell you, oh, you were right.
[1:32:44.160 --> 1:32:49.800]  Well now give them a video and tell them to make copies of my films, Endgame, Terrorist
[1:32:49.800 --> 1:32:58.720]  War, Truth Rising, Fabled Enemies, you get the DVD at infowars.com in high quality,
[1:32:58.720 --> 1:33:04.960]  and then burn copies of those suckers, the power that that has. And it's the venue, it's
[1:33:04.960 --> 1:33:09.880]  the medium. Talk radio is great, talking to somebody at a restaurant or church or the
[1:33:09.880 --> 1:33:16.720]  bar or wherever is great, or in the stands at a football game in the bleachers. But everything
[1:33:16.720 --> 1:33:21.360]  is visual now. Very few people read anymore or read books anymore. It's the film, these
[1:33:21.360 --> 1:33:25.640]  well produced films that show them the documents, that show them the globalists in their own
[1:33:25.640 --> 1:33:33.080]  words, that show them history. That's why videos are so effective. So please go to infowars.com
[1:33:33.080 --> 1:33:42.000]  today and peruse the bookstore and video store, not just my twenty films, 19 I've directed
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  and produced, 20th I produced. I guess if you count some others, it's like 22 I produced.
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:55.200]  But the point is, they're all there. And see how prolific the documentaries are, and also
[1:33:55.200 --> 1:34:00.280]  how timely. I mean, my films are evergreen because it's going off the globalist agenda.
[1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:05.520]  It's exposing it. So we're just tracking them. You can watch my first film made eleven years
[1:34:05.520 --> 1:34:14.240]  ago. Shot, a lot of it was shot twelve years ago in 1996. America destroyed by design.
[1:34:14.240 --> 1:34:21.240]  You can see a forty pound lighter Alex Jones, too. But the point is, is that it's evergreen.
[1:34:21.240 --> 1:34:27.720]  And that's the real test. That's the real judge of information is, well, what does it
[1:34:27.720 --> 1:34:36.120]  do over time? Does it become discredited? Does it become ridiculous? Does it look dated?
[1:34:36.120 --> 1:34:44.280]  Or does it have the look and feel of prophecy? And I'm not saying it's prophetic prophecy.
[1:34:44.280 --> 1:34:50.720]  We had their documents. We knew their agenda. And so, to the uninitiated, to fighting the
[1:34:50.720 --> 1:34:53.720]  new world order, to those that aren't aware, those haven't gone in the rabbit hole, they'll
[1:34:53.720 --> 1:34:59.400]  watch America destroyed by design made eleven years ago. Police State 2000 made ten years
[1:34:59.400 --> 1:35:05.160]  ago. Police State to the takeover made ten years ago. Police State three total enslavement
[1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:12.540]  made eight years ago. The masters of terror made seven years ago. Road to tyranny made
[1:35:12.540 --> 1:35:19.440]  seven years ago. Terror storm made two and a half years ago. In game made about fourteen
[1:35:19.440 --> 1:35:26.840]  months ago, released. Truth rising. They're all timeless because we really know what
[1:35:26.840 --> 1:35:32.040]  we're talking about. We really understand the agenda. And instead of saying, oh, aren't
[1:35:32.040 --> 1:35:38.360]  we great, aren't we special, I'm like, man, it's dangerous to be one of the few prominent
[1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:43.120]  alternative media leaders who really hits the sweet spot on the ball, that really hits
[1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:48.760]  a hole in one, that really understands the agenda because I actually study. People may
[1:35:48.760 --> 1:35:55.160]  think I can rant and rave or I can talk or, you know, I do a good radio show, I do a bad
[1:35:55.160 --> 1:36:00.480]  radio show, you know, interrupting people, whatever. The bottom line is I'm not so much
[1:36:00.480 --> 1:36:06.280]  even a talk show host or even a filmmaker as I am a researcher and someone who studied
[1:36:06.280 --> 1:36:12.080]  history and understands the enemy's program. So I hope you'll be part of history folks
[1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:20.080]  and help us wake people up in the most fertile ground mentally we've ever seen. The establishment's
[1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:25.240]  credibility is in free fall. In fact, it doesn't have much further to fall till it hits the
[1:36:25.240 --> 1:36:33.680]  bottom of the abyss. Now's the time to make, hey folks, you can go in there right now and
[1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:38.960]  wake people up like you never could before. Now about twenty five thirty percent of the
[1:36:38.960 --> 1:36:43.640]  public is going deeper into denial. I'm not saying you won't run into these poor people.
[1:36:43.640 --> 1:36:49.440]  I don't have any sardonic pleasure in knowing just how sad they are. But move on, don't
[1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:55.280]  as they giggle and laugh and get that self-deluded glazed-eyed look, that defense mechanism.
[1:36:55.280 --> 1:37:03.600]  Move on. Don't spin your wheels. Move on to people that do care, that do know something's
[1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:06.960]  wrong, but just don't know how serious it is. There's more of those people than you
[1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:14.840]  could ever talk to. So don't waste your time arguing with people for the sake of arguing.
[1:37:14.840 --> 1:37:25.320]  Move on. Do not cast your pearls of knowledge before fluoride-head, five-hour-a-day TV-head
[1:37:25.320 --> 1:37:31.120]  people that as the new world order is announced, as the world government is set up, as the
[1:37:31.120 --> 1:37:36.760]  martial law is announced, they will still be denying it as tanks roll down the streets.
[1:37:36.760 --> 1:37:39.720]  They'll still be denying it as their neighbor's kids are being kidnapped by the government
[1:37:39.720 --> 1:37:44.600]  or their children. I've seen them. They'll say, oh, it's just a mistake. The government
[1:37:44.600 --> 1:37:51.480]  means, well, I don't understand. I keep telling them. I feel sorry for those people. You can't
[1:37:51.480 --> 1:37:57.640]  help them. Deep down, they know the truth and they're scared and so they can't face
[1:37:57.640 --> 1:38:01.680]  the darkness. And so instead of standing up against the evil and having a chance of beating
[1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:09.560]  them, they're going to embrace any and all wickedness. See, they buy into the delusion.
[1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:15.840]  They willfully embrace it. They turn their own minds off. The new world order propaganda
[1:38:15.840 --> 1:38:23.400]  is tailored to make you lazy, to make you make the decision to rationalize. So please
[1:38:23.400 --> 1:38:27.800]  go to infowars.com to the secure shopping cart, get the books and videos, get a lot of people.
[1:38:27.800 --> 1:38:34.280]  So you have them if they shut down the web, which they're already doing incrementally,
[1:38:34.280 --> 1:38:42.280]  call toll free to get the videos, 888-253-3139. We have a two page brochure that's got most
[1:38:42.280 --> 1:38:48.840]  of the products, books and videos on it. I'm going to ship that out to you, 888-253-3139.
[1:38:48.840 --> 1:38:58.280]  Here you can write to me, Alex Jones at 3001, South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[1:38:58.280 --> 1:39:03.240]  I've done that rant there. It's just, you know, it's better, sweet, best of times, worst
[1:39:03.240 --> 1:39:09.760]  of times, as they say. I feel really accomplished and good in the work we've done. Not in a
[1:39:09.760 --> 1:39:18.000]  prideful way, but in a somewhat satisfied way and it encourages me to work harder. There's
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:24.120]  also a great sadness that I've made so many mistakes and not been as eloquent or as well
[1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:28.360]  thought out as I should be because I'm just human. But at the end of the day, I did the
[1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:34.360]  best I could. At the end of the day, I tried to be a good person. At the end of the day,
[1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:42.160]  I tried to take the high road. At the end of the day, I tried to empower those who had
[1:39:42.160 --> 1:39:49.360]  an important message and we have a long road ahead of us. Some of us won't make it all
[1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:54.440]  the way into that road, but if you understand you don't have a choice, you're on the road.
[1:39:54.440 --> 1:40:02.520]  There is no turning back. On this road, it is the future. We stand here at the present
[1:40:02.520 --> 1:40:09.720]  and we go forward into the future using as our map the past, human activities, the way
[1:40:09.720 --> 1:40:15.400]  we operate, the way elites have always operated. You know, I want people to understand something
[1:40:15.400 --> 1:40:21.600]  who laugh at this radio show and we get your emails. I want you to understand something.
[1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:31.880]  I got a couple of emails yesterday making fun of me sourcing the 19, what is it, 64, 65,
[1:40:31.880 --> 1:40:40.600]  Dr. Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick, General Jack T. Ripper, Jack the Ripper, who launches
[1:40:40.600 --> 1:40:50.280]  Plan R to send an air wing against Russia to Newcombe via continuity of government.
[1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:58.920]  That film is about continuity of government being able to bring in martial law, being
[1:40:58.920 --> 1:41:06.560]  able to decapitate the presidency, being able to start World War III. You see, in the early
[1:41:06.560 --> 1:41:11.160]  60s, there was actually a fight with NORAD and there was a plan and the Joint Chiefs,
[1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:18.840]  including LeMay, wanted to launch a ramp of attacks. That's now been declassified. Kubrick
[1:41:18.840 --> 1:41:24.040]  had declassified sources and Kubrick makes jokes in that film. Jack Ripper goes completely
[1:41:24.040 --> 1:41:34.440]  insane because of quote, communist conspiracies and the fluoridation of water, milk, ice cream,
[1:41:34.440 --> 1:41:42.200]  mandrake, children's ice cream. I always get these emails saying, oh, you're a nut. That
[1:41:42.200 --> 1:41:49.080]  movie makes fun of it. Kubrick was very subtle. It was the heads of major medical institutions.
[1:41:49.080 --> 1:41:57.720]  It was chemists. It was governors who came out and said, you want to put sodium fluoride
[1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:03.000]  in the water when it's a deadly poison and doesn't strengthen the teeth? They had all
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:10.840]  the studies then. Now they've had 90 plus percent of the EPA scientists and toxicologists
[1:42:10.840 --> 1:42:15.120]  sign open letters and go to Washington and ask the EPA, their bosses, to take it out
[1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:23.400]  and they were ignored and all these top dentists and scientists and neurologists and I mean
[1:42:23.400 --> 1:42:38.080]  Google fluoride bone cancer, Google fluoride pancreatic cancer, fluoride, thyroid disorder.
[1:42:38.080 --> 1:42:47.360]  That's just one thing. It is a fact that sodium fluoride devastates you, especially children.
[1:42:47.360 --> 1:42:51.720]  It is a fact that lowers your IQ on average. Some studies show 10, some 30. The average
[1:42:51.720 --> 1:42:58.360]  study, there's a bunch of them show about 20% IQ reduction. I mean they've studied comparable
[1:42:58.360 --> 1:43:04.960]  cities with comparable genetic complement, comparable economic status next to cities
[1:43:04.960 --> 1:43:10.320]  that have been fluoridated for 20, 30 years and there's a massive difference in cancer,
[1:43:10.320 --> 1:43:20.080]  in diabetes, in IQs and you just can't laugh and say that's not true. Just with fluoride
[1:43:20.080 --> 1:43:23.880]  alone, when you discover they knew it was poisonous, that the Soviets put it in the
[1:43:23.880 --> 1:43:31.880]  water, that the Nazis put it in the water, that the East Germans put it in the water
[1:43:31.880 --> 1:43:35.920]  and that they didn't de-fluoridate many areas of East Germany until after the fall of the
[1:43:35.920 --> 1:43:40.760]  Berlin Wall, when you find out it's in Pulitzer Prize winning books on World War II, when
[1:43:40.760 --> 1:43:46.000]  you find out it's a fact, does it that one issue open it all up to you? That we have
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:54.600]  engineers, social engineers running things who in 1947 spent hundreds of millions of
[1:43:54.600 --> 1:44:01.200]  dollars and 47 money to go lobby to put that stuff in over 60% of the water supply out
[1:44:01.200 --> 1:44:17.720]  now closer to 75. The cold-hearted will, the steel will of those upper-level engineers,
[1:44:17.720 --> 1:44:22.520]  perfect compartmentalization. The local counties and cities and states don't know, the local
[1:44:22.520 --> 1:44:27.400]  guys at the water treatment plant, well we just put this in, they say it's good for
[1:44:27.400 --> 1:44:31.400]  you, the doctors, the scientists, you know they're not specialists in that, they don't
[1:44:31.400 --> 1:44:35.320]  go out and read the studies, back then it wasn't on the internet, you had to go to the
[1:44:35.320 --> 1:44:42.440]  library, you had to go to the research libraries, but it still got out and the news just said
[1:44:42.440 --> 1:44:47.520]  you're a bunch of crazy McCarthyites thinking there's a Commie conspiracy, it wasn't a
[1:44:47.520 --> 1:44:54.960]  Commie conspiracy, it was a eugenicist program in government documents out of England by
[1:44:54.960 --> 1:45:04.200]  the 1920s and the Germans and the Russians picked up on that, it is a toxic sedative.
[1:45:04.200 --> 1:45:09.920]  Fluoride and its different varieties is one of the smallest particles, one of the hardest
[1:45:09.920 --> 1:45:20.440]  to filter and its whole family is one of the most psychoactive and deadly out there. And
[1:45:20.440 --> 1:45:25.120]  it's time for the denial on that front to stop, I mean I don't know how you can laugh
[1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:31.720]  any of you, how you couldn't, if there was a 1% chance I was telling you the truth,
[1:45:31.720 --> 1:45:35.320]  why wouldn't you go research it and find out? I mean look, we've come so far, we've got
[1:45:35.320 --> 1:45:43.440]  90 plus percent, it's in mainline TV programs, mainline news reports, 90 plus percent of
[1:45:43.440 --> 1:45:52.840]  the EPA scientist got together, organized and wrote a group letter to the EPA saying
[1:45:52.840 --> 1:45:56.480]  there's no doubt this is deadly, there's no doubt it's attacking the kidneys, that was
[1:45:56.480 --> 1:46:01.800]  their big one, just rock solid, hundreds of studies on that alone, it just kills your
[1:46:01.800 --> 1:46:11.240]  kidneys, burns the little buggers out, those little filters, those little body filters,
[1:46:11.240 --> 1:46:23.080]  only two you got, not alone, devastating, devastating, devastating. And now the people
[1:46:23.080 --> 1:46:27.640]  are realizing it and so what do they say, oh we're going to spray it on the crops and
[1:46:27.640 --> 1:46:35.080]  we're going to spray it on the food and we're going to put it in the milk and the baby formula
[1:46:35.080 --> 1:46:46.080]  and water for babies. And schools go around, I remember going to Margaret's Sanger Elementary
[1:46:46.080 --> 1:46:51.760]  School in Dallas and I remember the day came where we got our free little fluoride pills
[1:46:51.760 --> 1:46:56.040]  in our toothbrush kit and they have us take the red pills and I remember getting so sick
[1:46:56.040 --> 1:47:05.240]  from that, having my little brain hammered by that poison, which is just a massive dose,
[1:47:05.240 --> 1:47:08.720]  those little red fluoride pills I've looked up what they were putting in them, what they're
[1:47:08.720 --> 1:47:20.320]  putting them in today, it's 30, 40, 50 parts per million, when one part per million is
[1:47:20.320 --> 1:47:29.400]  what gives you a 20 point IQ reduction. And sometimes I think that's just the most effective
[1:47:29.400 --> 1:47:35.600]  thing to do for this radio show, instead of all the calls and the confusion and all of
[1:47:35.600 --> 1:47:39.320]  it, why not just get up here and do show up or show on the GMO crops and how it kills
[1:47:39.320 --> 1:47:44.360]  the rats and guinea pigs they give it to and how they approve it for your table. Maybe
[1:47:44.360 --> 1:47:48.040]  I should just do show up or show up or show with the thousands of studies that cell phones
[1:47:48.040 --> 1:48:00.120]  massively increase brain tumors and to stick your cancer. Why don't I just cover the things
[1:48:00.120 --> 1:48:04.040]  we can prove, I mean, because once you realize there are people that have the will to do
[1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:10.440]  what they're doing and that they're doing this by design, you realize nothing matters,
[1:48:10.440 --> 1:48:22.800]  not status, not bobbles, not acting cool, not any of the crud. It's just so, it's just
[1:48:22.800 --> 1:48:35.840]  so screwed up. I can't even really enjoy social outings anymore. I can't enjoy my quote status.
[1:48:35.840 --> 1:48:42.760]  He has torn the false worldliness away from me. More and more. And all that's left at
[1:48:42.760 --> 1:48:49.520]  the core of my being is the desire to defend innocence, the desire to get people to unlock
[1:48:49.520 --> 1:48:55.120]  their own minds and see incrementally how we've been brought into a position that is
[1:48:55.120 --> 1:49:01.080]  a holocaust all around us with soft kill, chemicals and biologicals and radiologicals
[1:49:01.080 --> 1:49:09.960]  being added to the basic staples of life. We are being killed. We are being mutated.
[1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:14.680]  We are under attack and there's no doubting. I'm begging you, please look into the claims
[1:49:14.680 --> 1:49:21.640]  I've made. Find out it's true. Question. Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[1:49:21.640 --> 1:49:30.080]  Worse. The world economic collapse could come any day. Question. Are you prepared or are
[1:49:30.080 --> 1:49:41.720]  you ignoring the signs? Question. Do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?

[1:50:17.360 --> 1:50:23.000]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:28.360]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did. Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-Eleven
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:36.120]  film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story. Whitman, EVA
[1:50:36.120 --> 1:50:43.160]  director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe. This film follows
[1:50:43.160 --> 1:50:47.800]  the growing momentum of 9-Eleven truth as brave souls throughout the world take action
[1:50:47.800 --> 1:50:52.600]  against their global masters. He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:50:52.600 --> 1:50:58.440]  He takes his hand off in a year, three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[1:52:11.800 --> 1:52:26.320]  Kevin Booth is going to join us in the fourth hour. I'm moving back because I want to keep
[1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:31.640]  taking your calls and get to the news. Cover some of the first transmission. All right.
[1:52:31.640 --> 1:52:35.080]  Listen, I want to take a lot of your calls. I'll never do it unless I just give each person
[1:52:35.080 --> 1:52:41.120]  about a minute and a half. Let's go to Wes, Dan, Garv, Chris, Pat and others as quickly
[1:52:41.120 --> 1:52:43.880]  as possible. Wes in Texas, you're on the air.
[1:52:43.880 --> 1:52:50.000]  Greetings, my friend. This is Wes in Texas for the Lady Elder Ruth's Poor Reception.
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:55.400]  What she really needs is a length of wire and two alligator clips. That's your best
[1:52:55.400 --> 1:53:01.240]  friend for reception. You can go into a radio shack and get a shortwave antenna. It costs
[1:53:01.240 --> 1:53:07.440]  like what? 10 bucks. It's a black coil. It's like a black plastic coil. It looks like a
[1:53:07.440 --> 1:53:12.420]  tape measure. Out of it comes a little clip that clips onto the antenna and then she just
[1:53:12.420 --> 1:53:18.840]  strings it around until it gets better. That'll sure work. Also, remember, the tyrant
[1:53:18.840 --> 1:53:25.160]  fears the jester's job more than the assassin's bullet. Don't forget to think about Project
[1:53:25.160 --> 1:53:30.600]  Mockingbird and Army psychological operations. They're doing stuff. What are they doing?
[1:53:30.600 --> 1:53:34.720]  They're getting under your skin with about half the calls. They're tar babies. Don't
[1:53:34.720 --> 1:53:40.880]  let them drag us down. Hang up on them. We know what they are. We know your objective.
[1:53:40.880 --> 1:53:46.000]  We have faith in you. You have faith in us. Go ahead. Thanks a lot, man.
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:50.720]  I appreciate your call. A lot of them aren't government. There is government out there.
[1:53:50.720 --> 1:53:57.320]  The government starts the disinfo and then the weak minds pick it up. I'm not even sad
[1:53:57.320 --> 1:54:06.840]  by people that attack me. I'm sad for them. I'm sad for them. Think about the people that
[1:54:06.840 --> 1:54:11.200]  run our government. They put sodium fluoride that's a cover name. That alone is deadly
[1:54:11.200 --> 1:54:15.920]  for all these other toxins in the water. Go to a public place. Look at little children,
[1:54:15.920 --> 1:54:24.120]  little babies. They poison them. They hurt them. You've got a cowardly public that just
[1:54:24.120 --> 1:54:29.720]  can't come to grips with that, so it's easier to laugh about it. It isn't funny, folks.
[1:54:29.720 --> 1:54:36.880]  That's only one of the ways they're attacking us. They're calling for new world order, new
[1:54:36.880 --> 1:54:43.560]  clips. All these presidential people like Biden, world leaders, and we're not even playing
[1:54:43.560 --> 1:54:47.960]  them. I don't even have to prove anything to you. It's right out in the open. We were
[1:54:47.960 --> 1:54:57.720]  right about everything. I mean, it's a nightmare. You don't have to go along with these authorities.
[1:54:57.720 --> 1:55:03.020]  These authorities are illegitimate. They're criminal. They're hurting us. They're hurting
[1:55:03.020 --> 1:55:10.680]  their own stupid enforcers. It's real. Bad people are in control. It really happened.
[1:55:10.680 --> 1:55:17.880]  They're arrogant. They openly take the bailout money and give it to themselves as bonuses.
[1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:23.760]  In some cases, it's over 500 million a piece for these executives, and they tell Congress,
[1:55:23.760 --> 1:55:28.560]  shut up and do what we say or we'll use Northcom on you. You don't know what Northcom is. You
[1:55:28.560 --> 1:55:34.560]  better find out. Dan in Florida, go ahead.
[1:55:34.560 --> 1:55:40.720]  The thought came to me the other day. You've had guests on over the years and recent months
[1:55:40.720 --> 1:55:49.320]  that they have contacts in the military, top brass, that are disgruntled with the way things
[1:55:49.320 --> 1:55:54.760]  are being run. One of your guests comes to mind, Steve Quayle. I've heard his radio
[1:55:54.760 --> 1:56:02.320]  show, and he seems to have a lot of contacts. As he puts it, there is no higher pay grade
[1:56:02.320 --> 1:56:09.760]  with some of these people, and they're telling him stuff. And what came to mind the other
[1:56:09.760 --> 1:56:14.960]  day was, I'm surprised there hasn't been a coup attempt in this country, is it because
[1:56:14.960 --> 1:56:20.840]  we already had a coup. The military industrial complex didn't save us. They took over. It's
[1:56:20.840 --> 1:56:27.440]  like they do in banana boat countries every week. Stay there.
[1:56:27.440 --> 1:56:34.440]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:56:34.440 --> 1:56:41.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:46.720]  against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:50.840]  Bin Laden. This is his ammo. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama
[1:56:50.840 --> 1:56:55.520]  Bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[1:56:55.520 --> 1:57:00.480]  ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that
[1:57:00.480 --> 1:57:06.720]  there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that
[1:57:06.720 --> 1:57:12.040]  some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers
[1:57:12.040 --> 1:57:16.760]  ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings
[1:57:16.760 --> 1:57:21.840]  in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at
[1:57:21.840 --> 1:57:27.840]  infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:53.840]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[1:57:53.840 --> 1:58:03.360]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live
[1:58:03.360 --> 1:58:12.160]  from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. The private offshore banks publicly run the government.
[1:58:12.160 --> 1:58:16.720]  They're openly transferring trillions and trillions of dollars tax money we'll have
[1:58:16.720 --> 1:58:22.960]  to pay back at gunpoint to themselves into private bonuses, you name it. And that's just
[1:58:22.960 --> 1:58:27.360]  the bonuses for the crooks running it. The private shareholders are stocking up and buying
[1:58:27.360 --> 1:58:33.320]  real assets. A lot of other news coming up, but let's continue with your calls. Garv
[1:58:33.320 --> 1:58:38.880]  in Florida, you're on at the air. Go ahead. Hey Alex, how are you? This is Garv. Welcome.
[1:58:38.880 --> 1:58:45.080]  I'm honored to talk to you. I've been listening to you recently and I'm actually a congressional
[1:58:45.080 --> 1:58:50.560]  candidate out here in District 24 running against two crooks, Tom Peany and Suzanne
[1:58:50.560 --> 1:58:59.440]  Cosmos. And I have run into this thing wanting to do public service, public interest. I think
[1:58:59.440 --> 1:59:05.280]  people can make a difference or sincere. But since the advent of the internet getting
[1:59:05.280 --> 1:59:11.880]  popular in 2000 and so on, your eyes start opening up to what's really going on. And
[1:59:11.880 --> 1:59:17.080]  I was one of those people in the beginning in the 90s. This is just conspiracy theory,
[1:59:17.080 --> 1:59:23.640]  but the more I looked into it and the information that you put out and quite heroically is just
[1:59:23.640 --> 1:59:30.600]  amazing. But you find out what's going on, not just locally, but in the international
[1:59:30.600 --> 1:59:37.920]  arena. That's right. The crooks are making their move. Absolutely. And you know, we are
[1:59:37.920 --> 1:59:43.480]  at the precipice and this is the time to strike while it's hot. This is still time right
[1:59:43.480 --> 1:59:52.240]  now to take action. Yeah. What we do now is going to shape the future like nothing else
[1:59:52.240 --> 1:59:57.640]  in recent history. Those are called liquefied or un-static times. They say society gets
[1:59:57.640 --> 2:00:02.120]  rigid and freezes, but then it's unfreeze right now because they have to unfreeze it
[2:00:02.120 --> 2:00:07.160]  to build their new world order. But that also opens them up to be exposed. And so right
[2:00:07.160 --> 2:00:12.360]  now we've got to strike while the iron's hot. Absolutely. Before they take total control,
[2:00:12.360 --> 2:00:16.240]  you know, I'm originally from India. You're the population of 1 billion plus and I've
[2:00:16.240 --> 2:00:23.360]  been in this country for over 20 years as a U.S. citizen proud to be it. But it's scary
[2:00:23.360 --> 2:00:27.960]  what programs they have instilled for the third world, developing countries like China,
[2:00:27.960 --> 2:00:32.440]  India. Oh, they've gone around in India under IMF World Bank loans, as you know, forcibly
[2:00:32.440 --> 2:00:37.320]  grabbing women and sterilizing them. Yeah. And they did that in the emergency as well
[2:00:37.320 --> 2:00:42.160]  in the 70s, you know, in the Gandhi sun. So it's scary what they're doing. And I don't
[2:00:42.160 --> 2:00:46.760]  know if you know about this whole fact. It was in the news recently, but the National
[2:00:46.760 --> 2:00:53.160]  Bank of China, I don't know what's going on there, but they invested about a 20% stake
[2:00:53.160 --> 2:00:58.440]  in the Watts child bank, in a Watts child bank in France. Yes. I don't know what's going
[2:00:58.440 --> 2:01:04.200]  on there. What's the underlining meaning behind it? Are they affiliating with the Watts child?
[2:01:04.200 --> 2:01:07.520]  They've always been. It was the Rothschilds of the British East India that shipped the
[2:01:07.520 --> 2:01:13.160]  opium in to take that country down 170 years ago or so. But, but really what we're dealing
[2:01:13.160 --> 2:01:19.240]  with here is a consolidation, vertical integration. The New York Times, again, got documents.
[2:01:19.240 --> 2:01:24.280]  They're even reporting what we already knew that you've got the bank executives bragging
[2:01:24.280 --> 2:01:28.880]  or they're just taking over right now. It's very funny. The arrogance is unbelievable.
[2:01:28.880 --> 2:01:33.040]  It's a complete, you would think this is the bizarro world. What's going on? It is. I
[2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:38.440]  mean, look, look, they're poisoning us. They're killing us openly. You've got swaggering arrogant
[2:01:38.440 --> 2:01:44.440]  Americans, you know, 30% or so that the establishment uses as their enforcers. And then you've got
[2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:49.000]  the rest of the people horrified and upset, but they can't even imagine how serious it
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  is.
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:54.320]  Right. And I want to let your listeners know it's absolutely true. I'm a biologist. I
[2:01:54.320 --> 2:01:58.680]  worked as an environmental scientist. I worked with the Social Security Administration as
[2:01:58.680 --> 2:02:06.680]  well in the past as a financial advisor. Fluoride is completely a detriment to your body. And
[2:02:06.680 --> 2:02:12.040]  also, what people don't know about is NutriStreet. I don't know if somebody told me this. I haven't
[2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:13.040]  really looked into it.
[2:02:13.040 --> 2:02:14.520]  It's ultra deadly. It's even worse.
[2:02:14.520 --> 2:02:21.520]  Right. It causes Alzheimer's. Least your memory loss, the aluminum cans that they use for
[2:02:21.520 --> 2:02:22.520]  the drug.
[2:02:22.520 --> 2:02:28.320]  Well, it breaks down into what alcohol? But that's only one component. Absolutely. And
[2:02:28.320 --> 2:02:32.160]  everybody knows what alcohol makes you go blind. It causes brain damage. Sir, great
[2:02:32.160 --> 2:02:37.800]  to hear from you. Good luck with your campaign. We'll be right back with Chris, Pat, Matt,
[2:02:37.800 --> 2:02:46.000]  Aaron and others. Stay with me.
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:50.640]  Hello friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[2:02:50.640 --> 2:02:54.560]  And today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent. And food and water
[2:02:54.560 --> 2:02:58.480]  is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread. You'll
[2:02:58.480 --> 2:03:03.240]  never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency
[2:03:03.240 --> 2:03:07.600]  if you simply prepare. Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for a special
[2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:11.760]  interest so they ignored your screams not to do it. They turned off the telephones and
[2:03:11.760 --> 2:03:17.160]  email. They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air. This money now owns
[2:03:17.160 --> 2:03:21.800]  the American and European banks. The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash
[2:03:21.800 --> 2:03:26.480]  your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food beyond
[2:03:26.480 --> 2:03:31.280]  many Americans reach. In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread
[2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:36.520]  doubled every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks. Food prices are skyrocketing
[2:03:36.520 --> 2:03:41.160]  so fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight. The private banks merging with
[2:03:41.160 --> 2:03:45.280]  our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[2:03:45.280 --> 2:03:50.120]  The stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business. Whatever happens in America,
[2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:54.520]  we need to be prepared and be ready. Everything is zeroing in on food. One third of Americans
[2:03:54.520 --> 2:03:58.680]  have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities. My friends, whatever
[2:03:58.680 --> 2:04:03.120]  it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food. For everybody out there listening,
[2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:06.640]  it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food,
[2:04:06.640 --> 2:04:10.560]  the government, the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset,
[2:04:10.560 --> 2:04:14.960]  a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness. No one is going to take care of your family
[2:04:14.960 --> 2:04:19.680]  in the final equation but you. You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's
[2:04:19.680 --> 2:04:24.440]  safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost

[2:04:58.520 --> 2:05:07.200]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he. He's Alex
[2:05:07.200 --> 2:05:16.200]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Here's some
[2:05:16.200 --> 2:05:21.480]  other things that are attacking your brain and your entire body every day. Cell phones,
[2:05:21.480 --> 2:05:26.720]  sodium fluoride, other chemicals they put deliberately in the water. The deadly prescription
[2:05:26.720 --> 2:05:31.280]  drugs they push on the entire population through the ads on television, newspapers and through
[2:05:31.280 --> 2:05:37.160]  the schools. But a big one is there are hundreds of different types of plastics that the chemists
[2:05:37.160 --> 2:05:43.320]  have come up with. But back in the 50s the one that got pretty much accepted and was
[2:05:43.320 --> 2:05:47.240]  made standard worldwide, we've had scientists on about this, there's a particular variety
[2:05:47.240 --> 2:05:56.040]  of plastics, there's only a few that do this, that leaches massive estrogen mimicking hormones.
[2:05:56.040 --> 2:06:00.480]  And these estrogen mimicking hormones, it takes a lot of discipline to stay away from
[2:06:00.480 --> 2:06:06.360]  these. I mean here I am talking about it and I should have a glass or porcelain glass to
[2:06:06.360 --> 2:06:13.040]  drink out of with my water generator, my atmospheric water generator, but no I have a plastic cup.
[2:06:13.040 --> 2:06:17.520]  I mean it takes a lot of discipline to get away from this. This thing leaches estrogen
[2:06:17.520 --> 2:06:21.800]  mimicking hormones. And those build up in women that are tribute to all the breast cancer
[2:06:21.800 --> 2:06:27.600]  and ovarian problems. You know you got the hormones you're supposed to have. And in men
[2:06:27.600 --> 2:06:37.320]  it makes men feminine. So this stuff will get you killed, it will get you hurt, so don't
[2:06:37.320 --> 2:06:41.600]  roll your eyes out there. I'm telling you this because it's documented and they know
[2:06:41.600 --> 2:06:48.080]  everything they're doing. They chose out of hundreds of types of plastics, the two subtypes
[2:06:48.080 --> 2:06:55.800]  that happened to leach this stuff. You understand? Melamine, plastic, stuff you cover counters
[2:06:55.800 --> 2:07:02.760]  with. The Chinese on purpose are putting that milk and food and thousands of food additives
[2:07:02.760 --> 2:07:12.760]  that are shipped here. Deadly, tax your whole body, fry your kidneys. The EPA came out and
[2:07:12.760 --> 2:07:20.040]  the FDA came out. The FDA was actually the one what last week and said melamine not bad
[2:07:20.040 --> 2:07:25.920]  for you. I'm not kidding. Everyone knows it's totally deadly. Just killed a bunch of people
[2:07:25.920 --> 2:07:30.520]  in China. They just say no it's good. They say mercury is good for your brain. It's
[2:07:30.520 --> 2:07:37.440]  not true. In fact I bet a lot of you out there doubted me here. I'll just go to Google right
[2:07:37.440 --> 2:07:47.640]  now. I'll just go to Google right now. Watch this. Google. Okay. On Google. You think of
[2:07:47.640 --> 2:07:52.480]  the exact headline with all of this together? People say oh you can get anything off the
[2:07:52.480 --> 2:07:59.840]  internet. No this is the Food and Drug Administration. Go to their website. Okay. Public gets concerned
[2:07:59.840 --> 2:08:04.120]  about poison in the food. Oh that's not bad for you anymore. Mercury and melamine they
[2:08:04.120 --> 2:08:14.120]  used to be bad but now they're good. What was the exact headline? FDA, melamine not
[2:08:14.120 --> 2:08:26.720]  bad for you. I think that was it. FDA, melamine not bad or maybe it was harmful. Didn't come
[2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:51.560]  up. I spell so bad that Google can't even. Let me see. FDA, melamine not harmful. I spell
[2:08:51.560 --> 2:08:57.040]  melamine so bad that Google can't even fix it. John, how do you spell melamine? Go ahead
[2:08:57.040 --> 2:09:04.320]  and come on airs. You're a good speller. Go ahead and try. Melamine. Let's see here.
[2:09:04.320 --> 2:09:15.640]  Melamine. Come on. No. M-E-L. M-E-L. A. M-E-A-N. M-E-A-N. Okay. I doubt that's correct though.
[2:09:15.640 --> 2:09:27.760]  There you go. FDA, look at this. This is a C-N-N. Okay. FDA, tiny amount of melamine
[2:09:27.760 --> 2:09:32.760]  not harmful to adults. Those other headlines that just said fly out is not harmful. Eating
[2:09:32.760 --> 2:09:37.820]  a tiny bit of melamine, the chemical responsible for a global food safety scare, is not harmful
[2:09:37.820 --> 2:09:42.160]  except when it's in baby formula, which should happen to be in. U.S. Food Safety Official
[2:09:42.160 --> 2:09:47.600]  said Friday melamine tainted formula has sicked more than 54,000 children in China. Oh, and
[2:09:47.600 --> 2:09:52.680]  it's being blamed for the deaths for at least four tots. The chemical has also turned up
[2:09:52.680 --> 2:10:00.000]  in products sold across Asia, ranging from candies and chocolates to coffee drinks. Now,
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  used in dairy ingredients from China, authorities in California and Connecticut have found melamine
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:09.120]  in white rabbit candies imported from China. But infant formula made in the U.S. is safe
[2:10:09.120 --> 2:10:13.400]  because manufacturers are not using ingredients from China. Food and Drug Administration said
[2:10:13.400 --> 2:10:17.640]  Friday that safety experts have included that eating a very tiny amount of melamine, what
[2:10:17.640 --> 2:10:22.160]  about cumulative, 2.5 parts per million would not raise health concerns even if a person
[2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:28.280]  ate food that was tainted with the chemical every day. Total bull. Without further ado,
[2:10:28.280 --> 2:10:33.240]  will you please pull up? The mercury is now good for your brain clip. People don't believe
[2:10:33.240 --> 2:10:36.520]  this. So we play this at least once a month for you. We have another clip where they say
[2:10:36.520 --> 2:10:45.280]  poison and food is good from MSNBC. Mercury is good for you. Yeah, they put out two federal
[2:10:45.280 --> 2:10:48.240]  studies. They call them independent in this newscast. They were federal studies. They
[2:10:48.240 --> 2:10:53.560]  say, oh, we found kids got smarter with mercury. Funny, when I go to the health store, it isn't
[2:10:53.560 --> 2:10:58.900]  on the shelf. Oh, mercury pills. Here it is. Mercury containing vaccines may have on
[2:10:58.900 --> 2:11:04.480]  kids. A life-saving device wins over the counter approval by the FDA. And sick of your glasses
[2:11:04.480 --> 2:11:09.440]  and contact lenses, a new corrective eye surgery is approved today. There's tonight's medical
[2:11:09.440 --> 2:11:16.000]  headlines with medical watcher Porter Seema Maverick. Mercury containing vaccines may
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:21.200]  help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics. There have been
[2:11:21.200 --> 2:11:26.120]  wide spread concerns that mercury based preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological
[2:11:26.120 --> 2:11:30.760]  development of children. These new studies suggest that the offices that the preservatives
[2:11:30.760 --> 2:11:37.560]  may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance. Oh, oh, oh, oh, you
[2:11:37.560 --> 2:11:43.120]  know they said May. And notice how these newscasts roll. Hi, oh, we've got some new things for
[2:11:43.120 --> 2:11:50.280]  you to help you. Oh, corrective eye service may be available. It's all the government,
[2:11:50.280 --> 2:12:03.400]  it's your friend, the media. There's no new world. All right, let's go back to your calls
[2:12:03.400 --> 2:12:13.480]  here. Let's go ahead and talk to I lose track of who's next, John. Chris in the great state
[2:12:13.480 --> 2:12:20.480]  of Colorado. Welcome. Alex, can you hear me loud and clear, Baba? Excellent. It's an honor
[2:12:20.480 --> 2:12:26.240]  to be able to talk to you. Honored to talk to you. Thanks for all you do. The constant
[2:12:26.240 --> 2:12:34.120]  information over the years, waking everybody up. You woke me up. Thanks for that and helping
[2:12:34.120 --> 2:12:40.480]  everybody get prepared. You know, I got water filters, storable foods, my distributor movies.
[2:12:40.480 --> 2:12:47.440]  I'm doing what I can out here a little bit. You know, even the old ones like prison state,
[2:12:47.440 --> 2:12:53.120]  I mean, police state 2000. I just watched that one the other day. It's still awesome.
[2:12:53.120 --> 2:12:58.800]  And you guys are my primary source for news. I don't watch Fox, you know, CMDC. You should
[2:12:58.800 --> 2:13:03.800]  monitor enemy transmissions. Well, I can't help it. You know, I work as an EMT and my
[2:13:03.800 --> 2:13:07.960]  partner's a Fox Newshead. So I'm in the process of turning him right now. It's kind of a
[2:13:07.960 --> 2:13:14.720]  delicate process. But anyway, I was calling partially to comment on the Jamaican caller
[2:13:14.720 --> 2:13:19.560]  earlier. No, yes, the White Devil. I didn't catch the beginning of it. Well, I mean, I
[2:13:19.560 --> 2:13:25.040]  know the ideologies. I said, I'm a White Devil. Right. And he said basically that I was reprieved
[2:13:25.040 --> 2:13:29.640]  because I had some Native American. I just, you know what? I'm sick of all of it. Well,
[2:13:29.640 --> 2:13:32.880]  you know, I'm tired of saying one group's evil and another, you know, I'm just tired
[2:13:32.880 --> 2:13:37.480]  of it. Well, I'd like to say, you know, like somebody who appreciates the music of Bob
[2:13:37.480 --> 2:13:41.000]  Marley, like you guys play top rank. And that's one of my favorite Bob songs. You know, I
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:44.640]  think Bob was a prophet, you know, and he, he brought some light into this world like
[2:13:44.640 --> 2:13:50.240]  a lot of people do, you know, for more than others. But like you and, you know, people,
[2:13:50.240 --> 2:13:56.560]  you know, greater than you. The Babylon system, you know, the vampire. Exactly. You know,
[2:13:56.560 --> 2:14:02.560]  and I don't know if he's heard Ziggy Marley's new album, Bob's Oldest Son. And he's, he's
[2:14:02.560 --> 2:14:09.040]  transcended Rasta. You know, he says, well, love is my religion. You know, and, you know,
[2:14:09.040 --> 2:14:12.560]  like Bob said on top rank, and you know, they just want to keep us fighting, you know, fighting
[2:14:12.560 --> 2:14:16.800]  each other because we're white or we're black or whatever, or because you're Rasta, you're
[2:14:16.800 --> 2:14:21.360]  in the 12 tribes, you know, you guys fight among each other. I mean, what's the deal?
[2:14:21.360 --> 2:14:26.480]  Um, you see, the roads, you know, divided people up over in Africa, you know, we can't
[2:14:26.480 --> 2:14:32.480]  forget that, you know, the manipulation when we get caught up into these, uh, little, uh,
[2:14:32.480 --> 2:14:37.480]  let's see categories. Yeah. I mean, Bob Marley was half devil. His dad was a, uh, Marine.
[2:14:37.480 --> 2:14:45.280]  That's right. That's right. He's half devil too. So, uh, but anyway, uh, yes, I just
[2:14:45.280 --> 2:14:48.360]  wanted to say that about him. You know, we got to transcend that, you know, we got to
[2:14:48.360 --> 2:14:52.360]  look the commonalities and, and the religion, the good and bad, you know, like from you
[2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:56.880]  and David Ike and Peter Joseph, you know, you guys all have like the same like overarching
[2:14:56.880 --> 2:15:01.160]  message. And even if people only believe 50% of what you say, I could have handled the
[2:15:01.160 --> 2:15:07.680]  whole Zeitgeist, Peter Joseph thing better. It's just out of the gates saying that genetics
[2:15:07.680 --> 2:15:11.840]  doesn't really have much to do with how we behave and act. I wasn't denying that Nate,
[2:15:11.840 --> 2:15:15.320]  that nurture had a lot to do with it. And, and, and it was just kind of the being talked
[2:15:15.320 --> 2:15:20.440]  down to, uh, you know, and I'm just tired of folks that don't live in Texas. I think
[2:15:20.440 --> 2:15:25.320]  we all ride horses to work in their tumbleweeds. And you know, I mean, that's really a cliche
[2:15:25.320 --> 2:15:29.720]  and, and a, and a very small minded to just say, there's a lot of people email me. She
[2:15:29.720 --> 2:15:34.560]  just said, look here, dumb Texan, you can't even comprehend what he's saying. And yeah,
[2:15:34.560 --> 2:15:38.840]  I mean, it's just mindlessness. I don't look at somebody of their African or Indian or,
[2:15:38.840 --> 2:15:42.960]  or Japanese or, or, or from New York city and think they must be stupid.
[2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:47.720]  Right. Well, I've listened to you for a couple of years. I know where you're coming from
[2:15:47.720 --> 2:15:53.720]  and I respect most of his messages. Well, I disagree on some stuff. But anyway, um,
[2:15:53.720 --> 2:15:59.280]  with the election coming up, uh, you know, Obama looks like the guy he's got his hip
[2:15:59.280 --> 2:16:03.960]  and his, his, his, his, his, if not expelled, but he puts over people at the, uh, the, the
[2:16:03.960 --> 2:16:07.720]  rallies, the neuro linguistic programming, you know, with the gestures to get everybody
[2:16:07.720 --> 2:16:13.040]  to just nod their head and say, he's, you know, the one. And it seems like he's going
[2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:16.920]  to be the guy, but you know, I don't know, they're, they're, they're fudging the polls.
[2:16:16.920 --> 2:16:20.440]  The polls look really close. Do you think they're going to swing it? Um, you know,
[2:16:20.440 --> 2:16:24.320]  I think it doesn't matter who the establishment wants. I mean, the presidency is definitely
[2:16:24.320 --> 2:16:32.240]  fixed, fixed by who they select nationally. They can steal it. Um, I just, uh, in the
[2:16:32.240 --> 2:16:36.160]  final equation, it really doesn't matter other than the fact that the establishment clearly
[2:16:36.160 --> 2:16:40.960]  wants Obama because they know they'll be able to get more with a new face through over
[2:16:40.960 --> 2:16:45.480]  on the public before they figure out it's another scam. Like the establishment says,
[2:16:45.480 --> 2:16:50.640]  Obama brings people back to the table, back to trusting government. And so for that reason,
[2:16:50.640 --> 2:16:54.840]  I'd rather have McCain because he can get less done.
[2:16:54.840 --> 2:16:58.440]  The economy is collapsing all around us. Banks are closing. The federal reserve continues
[2:16:58.440 --> 2:17:03.200]  to pump billions of dollars into the system to try to stop the bleeding. Know who is to

[2:17:35.920 --> 2:17:41.920]  possession. It is liquid. It is private. It owes no one. It cannot go bankrupt and it
[2:17:41.920 --> 2:17:48.000]  maintains its purchasing power. Find your answer at Midas Resources. That's 1 800 6

[2:17:56.680 --> 2:18:02.240]  course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemy struck
[2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:07.960]  America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Ben Lawton. This is his MO. We have
[2:18:07.960 --> 2:18:11.600]  to look to the Middle East. We have to look to the Psalm of Ben Lawton. Fabled Enemies
[2:18:11.600 --> 2:18:16.240]  is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[2:18:16.240 --> 2:18:21.320]  inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very
[2:18:21.320 --> 2:18:27.800]  much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been
[2:18:27.800 --> 2:18:32.920]  detained. Ben Lawton's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi
[2:18:32.920 --> 2:18:37.120]  Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow
[2:18:37.120 --> 2:18:43.440]  government and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super

[2:18:57.440 --> 2:19:01.600]  the struggle between freedom and fascism comes a story about two people who are faced with
[2:19:01.600 --> 2:19:05.840]  the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty. The whole country's on
[2:19:05.840 --> 2:19:10.560]  a bus, the crazy driver. If the passengers can't get hold of the wheel, we're all going

[2:21:16.720 --> 2:21:20.320]  It's classic divide and conquer. Most of the people that are awake can't even go out and
[2:21:20.320 --> 2:21:25.440]  wake anybody up to the basic generalities because they're busy saying it's Protestant, it's
[2:21:25.440 --> 2:21:35.000]  Catholic, it's black, it's white. When the real problem is in the heart and soul of men.
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:38.600]  That's why this show's been so successful. We just show people historically how they
[2:21:38.600 --> 2:21:45.320]  can affect change. We show them the true cost. We explain the new order master plan, how
[2:21:45.320 --> 2:21:48.800]  they're waging war against free humanity. Then we ask you the question, are you going
[2:21:48.800 --> 2:21:52.320]  to do anything about it? Here are some of our ideas to take action. Do you have your own?
[2:21:52.320 --> 2:22:05.320]  Crank it up. Oh, the blood. Through your line.
[2:22:05.320 --> 2:22:19.320]  Get an ancient time. Brotherly love.
[2:22:19.320 --> 2:22:31.320]  The sisterly love. I feel this morning. I feel you.
[2:22:31.320 --> 2:22:40.320]  Brotherly love. The sisterly love.
[2:22:40.320 --> 2:22:48.320]  The sisterly love. I feel this morning.
[2:22:48.320 --> 2:22:55.800]  Now you feel more loving in the morning. I love it when my children run in the morning
[2:22:55.800 --> 2:23:01.680]  and jump on me at 6.30 a.m. Do you ever notice how much better it feels to squeeze and hug
[2:23:01.680 --> 2:23:10.920]  your wife in the morning? That's that basic tribal unity. That's when you awaken in your
[2:23:10.920 --> 2:23:17.400]  true natural state, your primitive state. Before the cerebral cortex and all the programming
[2:23:17.400 --> 2:23:25.320]  they've laid into you through your life kicks on. You feel the brotherly love. The brotherly
[2:23:25.320 --> 2:23:36.320]  love. The sisterly love.
[2:23:36.320 --> 2:23:42.320]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls here. Pat in New York, you're on the air. Welcome.
[2:23:42.320 --> 2:23:46.320]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. Welcome.
[2:23:46.320 --> 2:23:51.320]  Yeah, I was listening and I was actually kind of glad to hear when you were talking about
[2:23:51.320 --> 2:23:56.320]  the state, the videos and the last caller had mentioned it. And they're great. Right now
[2:23:56.320 --> 2:24:02.320]  they're finally caught up to the real time. I mean, 10 years ahead of themselves and I'm
[2:24:02.320 --> 2:24:09.320]  just starting to blast those off again. I think anybody that doesn't have the set should
[2:24:09.320 --> 2:24:14.960]  definitely get it. That's right. It's on DVD. All three DVDs for super low price and allows
[2:24:14.960 --> 2:24:20.560]  us to put more ammo in our info weapons. Absolutely. And there are anyone that thinks
[2:24:20.560 --> 2:24:26.200]  they're all they were made 10 years ago. They're right on time. But I had a question for you.
[2:24:26.200 --> 2:24:32.160]  I was just, and I, it always kind of be loaders me, especially lately with the movement, so
[2:24:32.160 --> 2:24:40.160]  much energy going. Whether we, particularly, what are you going to see from being alternative
[2:24:40.160 --> 2:24:43.560]  and hit mainstream? I mean, what's it going to take for the audience?
[2:24:43.560 --> 2:24:47.720]  Let me answer our question. I mean, that's a good question. Our own movement sees anybody
[2:24:47.720 --> 2:24:52.920]  that's able to ever get any mainstream as a sellout. Oh my gosh, Alex is interviewing
[2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:57.320]  celebrities. Well, obviously that gets more people to wake up and to realize we are becoming
[2:24:57.320 --> 2:25:01.960]  mainstream. We need to take over the system. We need to have this be done peacefully if
[2:25:01.960 --> 2:25:07.400]  we can. And so folks think, oh my gosh, this is, everybody's waking up. Oh my gosh, all
[2:25:07.400 --> 2:25:11.480]  these TV shows are admitting new world order. Oh my gosh, and we don't like this. We want
[2:25:11.480 --> 2:25:16.960]  to be the only ones that know about this. No. I've always said we are the main line.
[2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:20.680]  We are the normal people. We don't want poison in our water. We don't want mercury in the
[2:25:20.680 --> 2:25:25.480]  shots. We don't want cops coming up all over the country saying we can't have video cameras
[2:25:25.480 --> 2:25:28.800]  on the streets, but they can cram them down our throats. You know, we don't want cops
[2:25:28.800 --> 2:25:33.280]  killing people with tasers every day. We don't want our borders wide open. We don't want
[2:25:33.280 --> 2:25:40.740]  tyranny. And so we have to be, you know, ready for an idea whose time has come. No army can
[2:25:40.740 --> 2:25:45.560]  stop an idea whose time has come. And we are mainstream. That's why they're trying to shut
[2:25:45.560 --> 2:25:50.040]  down the web piece by piece, because let me explain something. It's exponential. It's
[2:25:50.040 --> 2:25:56.000]  just, every week I say it's getting bigger. It's insane. It's insane how big it is.
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:26:03.800]  Yeah, it is. And it's encouraging to see the energy. But what would it take? What is it
[2:26:03.800 --> 2:26:09.600]  going to take for these, you know, I'm sure there's probably thousands of wealthy, powerful
[2:26:09.600 --> 2:26:15.440]  people that could make a headway into the CEO. You know, they have CNN, MSNBC, Fox
[2:26:15.440 --> 2:26:22.040]  News. What's it going to take for us to get our platform? I mean, before it's getting
[2:26:22.040 --> 2:26:28.560]  to the time now where it's time to move. And, you know, these things I think are important
[2:26:28.560 --> 2:26:29.560]  to have.
[2:26:29.560 --> 2:26:33.520]  Well, that's a vital question. Let me make a brief statement on the other side. I appreciate
[2:26:33.520 --> 2:26:45.040]  the call. Then on to others. And I got to get to this news. Stay with us.
[2:26:45.040 --> 2:26:52.680]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[2:27:59.600 --> 2:28:04.000]  was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:08.320]  World Order? I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a state. It was engineered by
[2:28:08.320 --> 2:28:16.160]  you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR. The day that we stop asking questions
[2:28:16.160 --> 2:28:20.720]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of just criticism to grow at our own door.
[2:28:20.720 --> 2:28:28.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place. An inside job,
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:36.560]  how dare you? If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason
[2:28:36.560 --> 2:28:41.440]  yourself. All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government has not told the
[2:28:41.440 --> 2:28:46.720]  trust in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of life. Since rising, download

[2:30:03.360 --> 2:30:05.280]  A lot of truly wealthy people
[2:30:05.280 --> 2:30:15.600]  don't get involved because they know the general public is extremely dumbed down,
[2:30:15.600 --> 2:30:19.840]  extremely selfish, very easy to manipulate.
[2:30:19.840 --> 2:30:32.160]  And all these issues are so complex, I mean I could talk for an hour just on this alone.
[2:30:40.960 --> 2:30:45.760]  And I know a lot of wealthy people, really wealthy people who've just left the United States the
[2:30:45.760 --> 2:30:51.760]  last three years. I mean the vice president is preparing to basically move out of the U.S.
[2:30:51.760 --> 2:30:58.480]  so is President Bush. They've done their job, they're globalist. They know that they're getting
[2:30:58.480 --> 2:31:01.360]  ready for a massive purge in this nation and they don't want to be here for it.
[2:31:04.720 --> 2:31:08.240]  I mean if you get a decadent know-it-all people who turn loose of government
[2:31:09.120 --> 2:31:12.880]  and decide that corruption doesn't exist, corruption will take over and then it will
[2:31:12.880 --> 2:31:16.880]  run wild like a wildfire, burning everything in its path.
[2:31:19.600 --> 2:31:23.280]  And then people get hurt really bad and a lot of times they fight back and then liberty is born
[2:31:23.280 --> 2:31:29.760]  again and people are a lot more serious, a lot more focused and you have a time of plenty
[2:31:29.760 --> 2:31:35.040]  and then their children and grandchildren become decadent and then it all happens over again.
[2:31:35.040 --> 2:31:38.960]  So the elite said over a hundred years ago they said well we need a scientific dictatorship,
[2:31:38.960 --> 2:31:44.720]  we understand these cycles, we understand that resistance to our tyranny comes from the middle
[2:31:44.720 --> 2:31:49.600]  class and so we'll just do away with the middle class and dumb down the population.
[2:31:50.240 --> 2:31:52.880]  We have all those documents and we cover them in in-game and other films.
[2:31:54.480 --> 2:31:58.640]  It's social engineering and they teach us to be brutish, they teach us new values. I mean people
[2:32:00.160 --> 2:32:07.520]  200 years ago, 100 years ago, 50 years ago, didn't like violence on TV, didn't like images of death
[2:32:07.520 --> 2:32:12.640]  and destruction because they weren't desensitized and more often than not they had actually seen
[2:32:12.640 --> 2:32:19.200]  real violence and so seeing somebody have their arms chopped off, well that would remind them
[2:32:19.200 --> 2:32:26.160]  of seeing their daddy's arm chopped off in the farm equipment or seeing somebody shot up on a
[2:32:26.160 --> 2:32:30.480]  battlefield, that would remind them World War II vets went to see you saving Private Ryan,
[2:32:30.480 --> 2:32:36.160]  where it was shot guerrilla style, very realistic, they had flashbacks freak out who never really
[2:32:36.160 --> 2:32:41.280]  had flashbacks because they were seeing something they'd been in but you get a public who's never
[2:32:41.280 --> 2:32:47.840]  done anything, never even been in a fight, never been stabbed, never had a bone broken, never been
[2:32:47.840 --> 2:32:54.960]  shot at and to them I mean I've gone you know back in high school and college days and seen people
[2:32:55.600 --> 2:32:59.680]  cheering and clapping during torture scenes and movies and enjoying it.
[2:32:59.680 --> 2:33:06.640]  You can go see Saw 5 when it comes out and watch people clapping and having fun in the theater,
[2:33:07.520 --> 2:33:11.280]  they have no connection to it so when they hear about Iraqis being tortured to death or
[2:33:11.280 --> 2:33:17.120]  people being shot off the road for fun they go yeah yeah yeah see they've now brought into evil.
[2:33:18.640 --> 2:33:24.320]  We've also got a delusional population, I mean I found just in daily life people I run into
[2:33:24.880 --> 2:33:28.800]  if they want to attack you because they're jealous of their envious or whatever they will just make
[2:33:28.800 --> 2:33:38.240]  things up you've done so you deserve to be attacked. See delusion once the public's taught to accept
[2:33:38.240 --> 2:33:43.280]  mass delusions, big lies well then they start creating their own little lives, their own daily
[2:33:43.280 --> 2:33:48.720]  lives and then they make bad decisions, they end up in a bad place in their life but they always
[2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:54.080]  just blame other people. I always try to blame myself, I always try to analyze what I've done
[2:33:54.080 --> 2:34:02.880]  wrong so I'll do it better next time and all I've got to my name and all I I know how valuable it is
[2:34:03.680 --> 2:34:09.440]  that when Alex Jones tells you something he is going to move heaven and earth to try to get it done
[2:34:10.560 --> 2:34:14.320]  that's why a lot of times I tell people no I'm not going to do this or no I'm not going to do that
[2:34:14.320 --> 2:34:20.000]  because if I say I'm going to do something I'm going to try to do it as best I can I mean that
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:26.400]  means busting my butt if I tell a film distributor I'm going to have this film ready on this date
[2:34:26.400 --> 2:34:28.560]  well we may not sleep the last week to get it done
[2:34:33.680 --> 2:34:37.440]  and those are the things that build strong societies now I'm not claiming I'm some
[2:34:37.440 --> 2:34:42.080]  chip off the old blocker a great guy either I'm plenty decking it plenty slovenly
[2:34:42.640 --> 2:34:46.240]  but compared to the average person I'm heads and shoulders above them
[2:34:46.240 --> 2:34:51.840]  we're a rotten society and I think we need to go ahead and come to grips with that
[2:34:52.640 --> 2:34:59.520]  we are a mentally ill degenerate backstabbing knuckle dragon group of surly
[2:35:01.360 --> 2:35:08.640]  entitled know-it-alls that follow the false left-right paradigm we warehouse our old people
[2:35:08.640 --> 2:35:13.600]  to die and don't take care of them we abort 50 million of our children because we don't
[2:35:13.600 --> 2:35:17.280]  want the responsibility not knowing we're destroying a wonderful thing even when you
[2:35:17.280 --> 2:35:21.120]  have children people still take it as a liability something that's bad the media
[2:35:21.120 --> 2:35:26.640]  tells you that over and over again so because you don't put energy into it it turns out being
[2:35:27.600 --> 2:35:28.320]  a bad thing
[2:35:32.240 --> 2:35:36.080]  I run into so many parents you have teenage children and they say I've just cut them loose
[2:35:36.080 --> 2:35:40.240]  I'm just not worried about I'm just gonna let them get in trouble I'm just gonna let them go to jail
[2:35:40.240 --> 2:35:49.920]  I'm just gonna let them I mean I love my family so much that I would
[2:35:53.600 --> 2:35:57.120]  that's one of the few areas morally that I'd have big questions because I'd cheat and steal
[2:35:57.120 --> 2:36:02.880]  from my family I've never had to but I mean I'll just be honest with you comes absolutely first
[2:36:03.600 --> 2:36:09.680]  in fact it's probably a sin I think my family most of the time I mean I'm my my mental view
[2:36:09.680 --> 2:36:16.000]  shifts from day to day but I mean my family I I know probably put them even before God and
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:17.280]  that's that's that's bad
[2:36:20.480 --> 2:36:26.640]  but I am a fleshly worldly person and I've transcended almost all the flesh except my family
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:32.320]  I'm tied to it it's who I am
[2:36:32.320 --> 2:36:38.880]  you know I've said other times that I would you know I put fight in the new world order first
[2:36:39.760 --> 2:36:44.160]  even at the expense and danger of my family so in a way I I do put God first I
[2:36:46.160 --> 2:36:51.760]  I do put doing the right thing first but but but doing the right thing tends to be the good
[2:36:51.760 --> 2:36:56.080]  thing for your family to begin with what I mean is by what I just said is I go back and forth mentally
[2:36:56.640 --> 2:37:01.840]  they say thinking a thing is the thing I think about man I could just sell everything I own and
[2:37:01.840 --> 2:37:06.000]  go live in some third world country and it'll probably be dangerous and bad too but at least I
[2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:11.120]  won't have my head on the chopping block but I just can't even begin to move in that direction
[2:37:13.040 --> 2:37:22.400]  and my gut tells me and my guts never wrong my gut tells me get out get out get out get out
[2:37:22.400 --> 2:37:28.400]  get out of here get out of the United States let all the good old boys and know-it-alls and
[2:37:28.400 --> 2:37:35.440]  establishment people have their new world order let them drink the fluoride let them take the shots
[2:37:36.560 --> 2:37:44.320]  let them eat the GMO food till their guts bust your family comes first but my gut my flesh
[2:37:44.320 --> 2:37:54.880]  tells me get out but God tells me stay in you know there's duality there's multi variant
[2:37:54.880 --> 2:38:00.880]  multifaceted thoughts and processes in man so someone see it as contradictory saying my family
[2:38:03.600 --> 2:38:08.560]  a lot of times my mind comes before we even doing the right thing or God but then I said
[2:38:08.560 --> 2:38:12.320]  but I have never done the wrong thing the name of my family
[2:38:14.720 --> 2:38:16.880]  but I know that that is a weak spot I've got
[2:38:16.880 --> 2:38:24.480]  I mean I'm actually a very violent barbarous primitive person we all have that aspect to us
[2:38:27.360 --> 2:38:31.920]  and you know some people will see it as a strength or a strong point I don't see it as that
[2:38:35.360 --> 2:38:38.880]  I mean I know with total commitment and certainty anybody does thing to my family
[2:38:39.920 --> 2:38:42.160]  I'm not going to control myself
[2:38:42.160 --> 2:38:51.520]  but in that is strength folks the fact that that you're not going to give in anymore and you're
[2:38:51.520 --> 2:39:02.320]  not going to back off and that you're committed and they say that you know you have the family unit
[2:39:02.320 --> 2:39:07.280]  the nuclear family and then out that side day of your neighborhood and then your city your county
[2:39:07.280 --> 2:39:15.760]  and you do report yourself and and and that's why I see everybody as my family I do and not
[2:39:15.760 --> 2:39:22.640]  in some sappy sense not at some Bill Clinton I feel your pain I see people I see other people's
[2:39:22.640 --> 2:39:29.040]  children as my family and it's not in some Hillary Clinton village way
[2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:34.720]  where the state comes in and you know it's the arbiter and the controller all I'm saying is
[2:39:34.720 --> 2:39:40.480]  I've noticed a lot of my fellow Americans enjoy seeing somebody else fall down
[2:39:41.840 --> 2:39:44.240]  enjoy seeing
[2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:50.720]  rich people fall enjoy seeing their competitors hurt
[2:39:54.400 --> 2:39:56.160]  and I do not take pleasure in that
[2:39:58.400 --> 2:40:01.840]  I mean I can enter into that psychological agency in my intellect
[2:40:01.840 --> 2:40:09.360]  but it's mainly only like experiencing the pleasure of enemies being defeated from afar
[2:40:15.200 --> 2:40:19.760]  the only satisfaction I have in seeing bad things happen in the new world order
[2:40:19.760 --> 2:40:22.000]  is that it lets me know they're human they're not invincible
[2:40:24.400 --> 2:40:28.240]  you know I uh when I was younger I didn't worry about growing old and then when I a little bit
[2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:32.800]  older I did worry about death and growing old and a little bit of vanity entered into it
[2:40:33.600 --> 2:40:40.240]  but now more and more I realize it's a great thing the experience of growing old being humbled
[2:40:40.240 --> 2:40:49.200]  by your body falling apart being humbled and being aware of the fact that you are finite in
[2:40:49.200 --> 2:40:55.520]  this body on this plane of existence and that it's so short and then what truly last is your deeds
[2:40:55.520 --> 2:41:01.680]  and what you do and your name and what you build for others it's called good old-fashioned
[2:41:01.680 --> 2:41:07.440]  hospitality I love cooking a meal and placing it before friends
[2:41:10.880 --> 2:41:13.280]  I like buying friends dinner
[2:41:15.920 --> 2:41:19.760]  and it's only because I have my head screwed on straight in that respect
[2:41:19.760 --> 2:41:27.360]  that I understand ministering and nurturing and nourishing those that I like
[2:41:29.040 --> 2:41:31.920]  is the truest human expression of what we are meant to be
[2:41:33.120 --> 2:41:38.240]  and so the enemy tries to take that instinct we have and say that's right pay more taxes help
[2:41:38.240 --> 2:41:43.840]  the poor but they take that money and hurt the poor with it so you can't just do the right thing
[2:41:43.840 --> 2:41:50.720]  in and of saying well they say it's a good thing so I'm going to do it you have to analyze what
[2:41:50.720 --> 2:41:57.120]  you're doing intellectually and then do the right thing it takes time it takes energy it takes
[2:41:57.120 --> 2:42:04.880]  dedication it takes commitment it takes research to do the right thing to know what's happened
[2:42:04.880 --> 2:42:11.040]  but it also takes discernment the more you commit to the truth the more you open up to the truth
[2:42:11.040 --> 2:42:16.480]  the more you look at the truth of yourself and and and the truth of the bad things you've done
[2:42:17.200 --> 2:42:23.120]  the more your mind will then open up to accept greater truths deeper truth you ever had a
[2:42:23.120 --> 2:42:27.600]  bad thought about something embarrassing that happened to you many years ago or something
[2:42:27.600 --> 2:42:33.200]  embarrassing something bad you did maybe nobody even knows what you did but you're still embarrassed
[2:42:33.200 --> 2:42:40.080]  about it you have that guilt that conscience is the basic programming of humanity a crime against
[2:42:40.080 --> 2:42:44.160]  the tribe you know what wrong is even if the tv tells you it's not a wrong
[2:42:47.520 --> 2:42:52.480]  and a lot of people flinch from thinking about bad memories and they run away from it
[2:42:54.080 --> 2:43:02.080]  whereas I don't flinch from bad memories I dive into them I want to re-experience that
[2:43:02.080 --> 2:43:13.680]  I want to understand it I want to understand why my mind blocks it out I want to open it up I want
[2:43:13.680 --> 2:43:17.840]  into my mind I want to see it all I want to experience it all
[2:43:20.320 --> 2:43:25.280]  and does that not mean that I'm not all over the map that I don't sink into primitive behavior
[2:43:26.160 --> 2:43:29.360]  you know we have the hills we have the valleys we have the mountains
[2:43:29.360 --> 2:43:36.240]  it doesn't mean I'm sitting out here judging or talking about being some high and mighty intellect
[2:43:37.120 --> 2:43:43.520]  I'm telling you there's so much more to you so much more that you can experience
[2:43:44.880 --> 2:43:50.080]  so much more that you can do you have power you and Aitley are made in the image of the creator
[2:43:50.080 --> 2:44:00.400]  of the universe and you have been given free will and free will is not about big plasma screen tvs
[2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:05.920]  and catalanx free will is not about bobbles and trinkets of power and segments of rank
[2:44:07.840 --> 2:44:09.600]  and unending competitiveness
[2:44:09.600 --> 2:44:21.120]  free will is about knowing yourself and knowing others and let me be clear I'm not saying that
[2:44:21.120 --> 2:44:28.000]  wanting nice things is bad that's the first step in being secure feeling secure being able to take
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:41.120]  care of yourself protect yourself to have a keep a nest a fortress a home a stronghold to have friends
[2:44:42.320 --> 2:44:49.360]  to have your mate to bring into the world the next generation of humans to set them on the path of
[2:44:49.360 --> 2:45:00.560]  goodness and righteousness and it's a hard road especially in these dark days these latter days
[2:45:07.600 --> 2:45:13.520]  it is appointed for a man to only live once and then to die
[2:45:13.520 --> 2:45:20.320]  it is appointed for a man to live 75 years and then to die
[2:45:24.480 --> 2:45:27.520]  and death is the great mystery it is the great equalizer
[2:45:32.320 --> 2:45:38.080]  and the new world order thinks they're going to escape death they're not they can roll out some
[2:45:38.080 --> 2:45:42.960]  quackery of computer neural interfaces and claim that that is the body and the soul
[2:45:46.080 --> 2:45:52.400]  of the king of the lord of the elite but it is not it is a fraud
[2:45:55.520 --> 2:46:03.600]  and so these great workers of evil will fall and all that they have built will fall into ruin
[2:46:03.600 --> 2:46:11.200]  and it will fall into dust and all of us will be punished in this life
[2:46:14.320 --> 2:46:20.480]  for the sins we've committed that's the truth about the universe you don't have to wait to die
[2:46:20.480 --> 2:46:26.960]  before you're punished we will all be punished for the crimes we've committed against humanity
[2:46:26.960 --> 2:46:34.080]  for the crimes we've committed against ourselves there is justice
[2:46:37.760 --> 2:46:39.760]  and that's why I fear God
[2:46:42.960 --> 2:46:46.720]  because I know that God only wants good things for us
[2:46:46.720 --> 2:47:00.080]  but there are rules and we do it to ourselves when we commit these crimes against the basic code
[2:47:02.240 --> 2:47:07.920]  the basic human family and God only steps out of the way
[2:47:07.920 --> 2:47:16.960]  God only removes his protection from the wicked from nations from people
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:20.880]  from families
[2:47:26.960 --> 2:47:34.480]  and this is a wicked nation this is a blasphemous rotten stinking corpse of a country
[2:47:34.480 --> 2:47:37.440]  where there's still a lot of good left in it
[2:47:39.840 --> 2:47:51.040]  but the darkness is growing fast the rotten flesh of the world is blackening and dripping

[2:51:29.200 --> 2:51:32.480]  hi alex uh this is matt from good old york shirkingland uh
[2:51:33.200 --> 2:51:38.240]  i'll tell you about me on the show by the way uh yeah my first question is uh i'd like to say
[2:51:38.240 --> 2:51:47.200]  um uh i'll uh that you're my hero basically you've uh uh you know we did the ms ms b m bcr
[2:51:47.200 --> 2:51:53.920]  fox news i think it was when you're bullying them i thought it was uh excellent uh obviously what
[2:51:53.920 --> 2:51:59.360]  you did there um oh you know they had me arrested now that was that was some fun yeah what what
[2:51:59.360 --> 2:52:05.520]  what happened there did the charge or did they release you now they charged me with uh a
[2:52:05.520 --> 2:52:13.760]  a non-arrestable misdemeanor so then i had to send a lawyer to court remotely from texas uh and
[2:52:13.760 --> 2:52:19.600]  then they basically dropped the charge right right do you see those two bit that one uh my wife
[2:52:19.600 --> 2:52:24.400]  called them bimbo they were like alien twins were they you know were you were you right at the front
[2:52:26.320 --> 2:52:33.600]  uh yes uh they uh they well that's what they do those shows are you know they have the guys
[2:52:33.600 --> 2:52:37.600]  that are cute for girls and the girls that are cute for guys and they smile at you and
[2:52:37.600 --> 2:52:41.760]  blink and wink at you and then people sit there feeling like the tv's their friend
[2:52:42.640 --> 2:52:48.160]  yeah yeah well my other question is obviously you mentioned that you saw the w movie i've just
[2:52:48.160 --> 2:52:53.680]  recently seen the in the w movie now the the the question i want obviously about about the movie
[2:52:53.680 --> 2:52:58.800]  is um the part where they're on the table and i think it's david kelly called quote me if i'm wrong
[2:52:58.800 --> 2:53:03.920]  i mentioned obviously that that the intelligence was wrong because there's no weapons of mass destruction
[2:53:03.920 --> 2:53:10.640]  i'll do it or uh biological or chemical weapons and did you believe that the mi5 mi6 killed him
[2:53:12.320 --> 2:53:18.640]  dr david kelly yep well i mean they absolutely killed him and what 87 percent of brits believe
[2:53:18.640 --> 2:53:26.000]  they killed him he was they say he slit his wrist and died but there was no blood at the scene in
[2:53:26.000 --> 2:53:32.240]  the park and the local police that walked up saw five men in black uniforms run away from the body
[2:53:32.880 --> 2:53:38.480]  i mean a cop would know in 10 seconds you walk up there's a dead body with the wrist slit with
[2:53:38.480 --> 2:53:44.800]  no blood there so he was either brought there and blood to death somewhere else or he was
[2:53:44.800 --> 2:53:47.760]  injected with something and then they slit his wrist to make it look like that and then later
[2:53:47.760 --> 2:53:52.400]  they found that's what had happened because the way his wrists were slit he wouldn't have led to death
[2:53:52.400 --> 2:53:59.360]  and then he had three undigested pills in his stomach right so i mean they killed him in front
[2:53:59.360 --> 2:54:06.720]  of everybody you know the the killers ran off from him right another another thing is obviously
[2:54:06.720 --> 2:54:12.480]  you mentioned uh fellow auctioneer paul watson about this um uh uk cops having these scanning
[2:54:13.200 --> 2:54:17.040]  finger machines and what's one of your older clips by the way you know when you went into that
[2:54:17.600 --> 2:54:22.160]  office in texas i think was very good 1997 and i said they're gonna thumb scan you know
[2:54:22.160 --> 2:54:25.920]  on the street and police cars into school lunches because i read the federal documents
[2:54:25.920 --> 2:54:33.120]  going to be a world ID card yep yeah i mean well obviously did they arrest you to the charger
[2:54:33.920 --> 2:54:40.480]  no they well again because civil matters a lot of times they arrest demonstrators and then drop
[2:54:40.480 --> 2:54:45.440]  the charges because if they hold the charges they end up losing the case and then get sued
[2:54:45.440 --> 2:54:54.880]  for false imprisonment right right because um like i said i mean i mean the uk is it is
[2:54:54.880 --> 2:55:00.080]  definitely um getting to the police state as now no there's no doubt yeah yeah i mean that they're
[2:55:00.080 --> 2:55:05.280]  only scanning um finger print machines you know obviously on the streets and it is getting quite
[2:55:05.280 --> 2:55:10.080]  bad obviously where i'm in yorkshire it's uh they did they're having a zero tolerance policy
[2:55:10.080 --> 2:55:15.520]  it's about letting you know you're a slave and they run around with mobile body scanning trucks and
[2:55:15.520 --> 2:55:19.920]  face scanners and tell the screens that shout orders at you on the streets we now have those in

[2:57:46.240 --> 2:57:50.880]  into the whole drug war some of the propositions around the country to try to decriminalize the
[2:57:50.880 --> 2:57:55.840]  drugs the government ships in to put us in prison yeah it's a set up it's a frame up
[2:57:56.560 --> 2:58:01.360]  by the way we we know what we're talking about here within 20 minutes of that report last week
[2:58:01.920 --> 2:58:06.080]  of the girl in texas i guess it was in lubeck or was it midland i forget
[2:58:06.080 --> 2:58:13.520]  it carving the b on her own face and it was backwards putting that makeup on her eye
[2:58:15.440 --> 2:58:21.760]  friday morning 11 a.m we come on air and we tell you that it's fake
[2:58:23.120 --> 2:58:28.240]  and we tell you she carved it backwards in her own face and that she's a mental patient
[2:58:29.360 --> 2:58:33.120]  and then it came out two days later that she had indeed staged it
[2:58:33.120 --> 2:58:41.520]  now we're not stupid the b was backwards it was makeup on her eye she refused medical attention
[2:58:41.520 --> 2:58:47.040]  because she didn't want anybody looking at it and of course the cops knew that in five minutes she
[2:58:47.040 --> 2:58:54.080]  was a liar and the mindless public debated whether or not it was true and i heard john mccain supporters
[2:58:54.080 --> 2:58:59.680]  mindlessly because they were against obama going with the trap and saying oh yes we think it's true
[2:58:59.680 --> 2:59:03.920]  how dare anyone say it's fake it's like i heard him laugh two weeks ago saying oh senator tet
[2:59:03.920 --> 2:59:09.840]  stevens is innocent and he was found guilty on all seven counts same thing democrats will defend
[2:59:09.840 --> 2:59:15.840]  corrupt democrats no matter what they do we know how the world works we're not dumb a backwards b
[2:59:16.400 --> 2:59:21.280]  she did it in a mirror only an idiot like that would think they could get away with something like that
[2:59:21.280 --> 2:59:28.640]  you know the guy off camera at the atm did this to her we understand false flags
[2:59:30.080 --> 2:59:35.680]  staged terror events that's what that was it was a false flag now cops you're not stupid
[2:59:36.240 --> 2:59:41.920]  you knew she was a big fat liar and you know something else if you look for five minutes
[2:59:41.920 --> 2:59:47.200]  at 9 11 you'd understand just like la pd detectives i've hung out with they all sit around
[2:59:47.200 --> 2:59:54.720]  laughing going of course we knew it was inside job day one only a moron a self-deluded idiot
[2:59:54.720 --> 2:59:58.880]  would not know that oklahoma city the first world trade center attack and the second world
[2:59:58.880 --> 3:00:06.000]  trade center attack were inside jobs i'm not gonna self-delude i'm not gonna sit here and lie to
[3:00:06.000 --> 3:00:13.600]  myself it took 15 seconds to read that article and look at her face and say that's staged
[3:00:13.600 --> 3:00:18.320]  and we said on air it's staged watch
[3:00:21.440 --> 3:00:24.160]  all those church burnings turned out those were staged
[3:00:27.680 --> 3:00:31.840]  remember all those black churches getting burned down staged by groups wanting to pass
[3:00:32.400 --> 3:00:33.760]  anti-free speech loss
[3:00:36.400 --> 3:00:40.160]  nine times out of 10 or more i mean it's more than nine out of 10 point like nine out of
[3:00:40.160 --> 3:00:47.600]  99 out of 100 people put swastikas on their dorm rooms blacks you do you know put the

[3:01:04.480 --> 3:01:11.280]  going to be for bonuses for the ceo's and for the executives and for the shareholders because it
[3:01:11.280 --> 3:01:18.640]  was in the bill i mean how does you know because they said they do this decades ago and they do
[3:01:18.640 --> 3:01:23.200]  it in third world countries all the time because i know what i'm talking about and i'm done we
[3:01:23.200 --> 3:01:29.200]  don't have time to argue or play games anymore we got psychos that put poison in the water
[3:01:29.200 --> 3:01:34.960]  they carried out 9 11 run in this country you think it's fun to go up against these people you think
[3:01:34.960 --> 3:01:42.400]  i like it i learned about government sponsored terrorism in 1995
[3:01:45.040 --> 3:01:47.280]  and i've been screaming bloody murder about it ever since
[3:01:49.200 --> 3:01:53.520]  look at how they've used the terror attack to take your liberties and freedoms to pass all these
[3:01:53.520 --> 3:01:59.360]  laws on banking and your life and your children non-terror related look at how they lie about
[3:01:59.360 --> 3:02:06.720]  everything and all the other points and then tell me they're not crooks tell me they're not bad
[3:02:07.760 --> 3:02:14.320]  tell me this government isn't reprobate and bankrupt seven ways to sunday up one side and
[3:02:14.320 --> 3:02:23.360]  down the other from pillar to post from pier to beam the link breadth depth we'll be right back
[3:02:23.360 --> 3:02:29.200]  ladies and gentlemen hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important
[3:02:29.200 --> 3:02:33.200]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent
[3:02:33.200 --> 3:02:38.000]  and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread
[3:02:38.000 --> 3:02:42.160]  you'll never have to go to the super dome and beg for femen to take care of your family in any
[3:02:42.160 --> 3:02:46.800]  emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[3:02:46.800 --> 3:02:51.360]  to special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and
[3:02:51.360 --> 3:02:56.320]  email they voted to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money
[3:02:56.320 --> 3:03:01.200]  now owns the american and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will
[3:03:01.200 --> 3:03:06.560]  slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many
[3:03:06.560 --> 3:03:12.400]  americans reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[3:03:12.400 --> 3:03:17.760]  until it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if
[3:03:17.760 --> 3:03:22.560]  there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[3:03:22.560 --> 3:03:27.200]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack of prices
[3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:32.000]  to stay in business whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is
[3:03:32.000 --> 3:03:36.560]  zeroing in on food one third of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other
[3:03:36.560 --> 3:03:42.160]  necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody

[3:05:14.640 --> 3:05:21.120]  country to try to decriminalize some of the drugs the government uses to get involved in our lives
[3:05:21.120 --> 3:05:27.600]  they tend to ship in as well and we also have a expert joining us later in the interview friends
[3:05:27.600 --> 3:05:33.760]  with kevin we've got the founder and executive director of the drug policy alliance new york
[3:05:33.760 --> 3:05:37.680]  city based nonprofit organization working to end the war on drugs he's considered one of the most
[3:05:37.680 --> 3:05:42.080]  outspoken advocates of drug legalization kevin i appreciate you sub-setting him up for the show

[3:05:52.800 --> 3:06:00.080]  the hour did did did you give him the studio backline yes okay good um tell us about well
[3:06:00.080 --> 3:06:06.320]  i mean number one let's get into some of the initiatives that are going on right now well
[3:06:06.320 --> 3:06:16.560]  this is a proposition five here in california and it's basically just it it's put it this
[3:06:16.560 --> 3:06:24.000]  way the drugs are the prisons the uh the the the massive prison guard unions which i don't
[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:30.320]  even cover my film which are very powerful out here uh are working hard to to stop this thing
[3:06:30.320 --> 3:06:36.320]  because what they try to do which they've been very successful with that my film covers is they
[3:06:36.960 --> 3:06:42.880]  they make one single category out of nonviolent drug offenders and rapists and murderers and
[3:06:42.880 --> 3:06:48.240]  they try to make it so if you get caught growing a pop plant that you're going to go and sit in
[3:06:48.240 --> 3:06:53.120]  jail with some guy who uh murdered and raped everybody well that's because what eighty
[3:06:53.120 --> 3:06:58.640]  something percent of drug users only smoke marijuana illegal drug users and it's modern
[3:06:58.640 --> 3:07:02.720]  slavery governments have always wanted slavery you got the private banks that launder the money
[3:07:02.720 --> 3:07:10.960]  that own the private uh prisons and then that devalues uh the uh the uh base of wages that
[3:07:10.960 --> 3:07:15.440]  people are pay were competing against the millions of people uh it working in the growing prison
[3:07:15.440 --> 3:07:21.200]  industries and so they don't want to go away they want the easy to control little weed heads
[3:07:21.200 --> 3:07:27.200]  uh there in their slave pit yeah now and and it's a way to keep the numbers up it's all a numbers
[3:07:27.200 --> 3:07:33.600]  game so they they you know if they take all the pot smokers out of this equation they're gonna
[3:07:33.600 --> 3:07:38.480]  lose a ton of business and so they have to flush all these things together but it's not even just
[3:07:38.480 --> 3:07:44.240]  like who they arrested also a lot have it has to do with how many how many years uh you get the
[3:07:44.240 --> 3:07:49.760]  the the sentencing guidelines are big on it too whether you get six months or six years uh also
[3:07:49.760 --> 3:07:53.280]  has a lot to do with how much profit the prison and the guards are going to make yeah I was pretty
[3:07:53.280 --> 3:07:58.000]  shameful a few months ago when I had the Ted Nugent on he was like throw all the potheds in prison
[3:07:58.000 --> 3:08:05.840]  they're lazy yeah that'll work that's that's uh really good uh good system I mean what a corrupt
[3:08:05.840 --> 3:08:11.120]  stinking government they're pushing Ridlin prozac hundreds of other deadly drugs on the kids in
[3:08:11.120 --> 3:08:16.560]  school half the public's completely drunk it on prozac but meanwhile let's put everybody in jail
[3:08:16.560 --> 3:08:23.120]  who smokes marijuana no it's absolutely sane and giving them longer sentences in some cases I mean
[3:08:23.120 --> 3:08:28.800]  people get longer sentences for growing pot in some cases than than rape or murder well every
[3:08:28.800 --> 3:08:32.400]  week I read about a swat team gunning people down in their house who had pot plants I mean
[3:08:32.400 --> 3:08:38.000]  I mean what's the greater threat some weed heads or uh men stomping around knocking down doors at
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:45.040]  4 a.m. yeah now it's uh it's terrible so I mean prop five is I will have Ethan on in a little while
[3:08:45.040 --> 3:08:51.600]  to explain the specifics of it my understanding is that it's trying to shift from incarceration
[3:08:51.600 --> 3:08:58.160]  over to rehabilitation both to save the taxpayers of California approximately two and a half billion
[3:08:58.160 --> 3:09:03.440]  dollars per year yeah but then the undercover cops can't drive around and brand new chargers and
[3:09:04.320 --> 3:09:09.920]  brand you know Porsches and act cool I mean you know yeah and they have to get down you know they
[3:09:09.920 --> 3:09:14.160]  remember here in LA they had that uh got I forgot what they called it that battering ram thing that
[3:09:14.160 --> 3:09:18.720]  they put on the front of this tank um well yeah I mean these are guys that are too scared to go
[3:09:18.720 --> 3:09:23.680]  join the military they like picking on potheds I mean they gotta act tough man yeah definitely I
[3:09:23.680 --> 3:09:29.840]  mean but it's it's just a way to get those numbers up keep those keep those prisons full um it's
[3:09:29.840 --> 3:09:35.440]  funny I even gotten some I got my first angry email you know in my film I talk about the city of Taft
[3:09:35.440 --> 3:09:41.040]  because that's where Tommy Chong was at the prison there I got my first email from a guy in Taft
[3:09:41.040 --> 3:09:46.160]  you know saying like Taft still has oil and you know we're not relying on the prison system
[3:09:46.160 --> 3:09:52.000]  and we're a great town you know I got like defensive first town um lots like two leader
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:57.280]  the only business was was the prison then they literally like the old days when just around
[3:09:57.280 --> 3:10:02.240]  at the blacks up and threw them in the slave pit well that's the problem Kevin I mean we've got
[3:10:02.240 --> 3:10:06.000]  the vast majority of the public in every pole saying decriminalize marijuana at least
[3:10:06.800 --> 3:10:11.760]  and all these states are trying to decriminalize it but the feds row around attacking people
[3:10:11.760 --> 3:10:15.040]  I mean I don't see how they're going to get away with this drug war forever so now they're trying
[3:10:15.040 --> 3:10:21.120]  to tie marijuana in with terrorism yeah that was like one of the things that that Bush did you
[3:10:21.120 --> 3:10:25.760]  know right around the creation of the Patriot Act and coming out with that campaign that's in my
[3:10:25.760 --> 3:10:31.760]  film the nick and norm campaign or if uh if you buy it if you buy marijuana you support terrorism
[3:10:32.720 --> 3:10:39.360]  and they got the truth because it's because it is true the guys at the dinner table going
[3:10:39.360 --> 3:10:43.680]  oh just because I smoke a little weed I mean it is what's funny about it is that I actually got
[3:10:43.680 --> 3:10:48.160]  the copy of film because I think the guy that plays nick is actually a struggling actor out here
[3:10:48.160 --> 3:10:54.080]  in LA and some guy from a editing studio had his actor reel and we were like looking at this this
[3:10:54.080 --> 3:10:59.600]  actor's acting reel and he was like nick from nick and norm and like fell over dying laughing
[3:11:01.840 --> 3:11:07.200]  oh whatever so let's just have a moment of silence here
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:17.440]  Kevin so much is going on tell the story about how you're you're flying around the country
[3:11:17.440 --> 3:11:21.520]  on the speaker's circuit all these universities institutions people want to hear from you
[3:11:21.520 --> 3:11:26.400]  with your award-winning film and how they're trying to stop you from coming to the universities
[3:11:27.360 --> 3:11:31.440]  well first of all I want to say the biggest conspiracy right now are the people making money
[3:11:31.440 --> 3:11:37.280]  off bottled water if you travel as much as I do the the biggest scam going at the airport right now
[3:11:37.280 --> 3:11:41.040]  is uh give us your bottle of water on this side of this thing and then you cross through this
[3:11:41.040 --> 3:11:44.320]  thing and then you go here you can buy another bottle of water from us and then they throw these
[3:11:44.320 --> 3:11:49.280]  bottles of water in this giant thing and they probably move them around back and then re-consolidate
[3:11:49.280 --> 3:11:53.760]  them and sell them to you I was like what are you gonna do with all that water I guess you
[3:11:53.760 --> 3:11:58.720]  could give it to prisoners or something or give it to what do you do what do you guys do with
[3:11:58.720 --> 3:12:04.880]  all your bottled water but but I mean tell the story about oh yeah so I was going to a university
[3:12:04.880 --> 3:12:13.200]  in Florida where was this Fort Myers and somebody there on the faculty some woman on the faculty
[3:12:13.200 --> 3:12:18.640]  started passing around an email to everybody telling them that she was very upset that they
[3:12:18.640 --> 3:12:24.080]  were bringing me in as a speaker and that the young students didn't need to be exposed to
[3:12:24.080 --> 3:12:28.400]  something this controversial right before an election and then tell them the ultimate piece
[3:12:28.400 --> 3:12:34.880]  of evidence of your evil I discovered that mr. booth had worked on ninja bachelor party
[3:12:34.880 --> 3:12:46.160]  which is which is non-sexual I mean it's it's it's it's you and Bill Hicks acting stupid
[3:12:46.160 --> 3:12:50.320]  you know acting like you're going to ninja school ninja bachelor parties is like that's my own
[3:12:50.320 --> 3:13:01.440]  bill airs moment right not once not twice well twice I mean it look at my resume twice it's
[3:13:01.440 --> 3:13:07.200]  I was drinking the robotess oh dr. Depp that's me
[3:13:09.600 --> 3:13:13.040]  honey I'm disappointed in you we always end up talking about this don't we
[3:13:13.040 --> 3:13:18.000]  there I'll tell you a funny story so I go to these lecture rooms I'm in I'm in upstate New York
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:23.600]  about a week ago freezing cold Oswego so many of the kids are apathetic that's a scary thing is
[3:13:23.600 --> 3:13:28.560]  how apathetic so many kids are well they're TV heads so I do I do this one classroom it's really
[3:13:28.560 --> 3:13:34.000]  cool teacher he has me to a second classroom big lecture hall I'm doing I do this little 15
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:39.920]  minutes set that's like a multimedia presentation with a monologue and then the Q&A you get to
[3:13:39.920 --> 3:13:44.480]  this section where I'm like you know how many kids smoke pot you know they're half the room you know
[3:13:44.480 --> 3:13:48.080]  or raises their hands you know how many people are stoned right now everybody's laughing and
[3:13:48.080 --> 3:13:53.680]  joking so in the corner of my there's this other there's this one other guy a young black guy dressed
[3:13:53.680 --> 3:13:58.480]  in a pinstripe suit doesn't really look like he fits so I get up and leave and he's the next
[3:13:58.480 --> 3:14:04.480]  speaker he comes up out after me it turns out he was an narcotics officer and so the kids come to
[3:14:04.480 --> 3:14:08.320]  my show later and they thought that I'd set them up because I'm like the cool guy that gets up
[3:14:08.320 --> 3:14:13.520]  there and like how many people in the audience do drugs everybody raise your hands whoo all right
[3:14:13.520 --> 3:14:19.520]  up next officer Johnson yeah and those guys are totally sold into their system it's their career
[3:14:19.520 --> 3:14:24.880]  so they've got to defend it and then they'll argue well look at all these unsavory types
[3:14:24.880 --> 3:14:28.880]  they're involved with drugs yeah because you make it illegal now you've just given the criminal
[3:14:28.880 --> 3:14:32.720]  element something to make a lot of money off of but they've got a problem there are these bigger
[3:14:33.520 --> 3:14:37.760]  and bigger organizations forming filled with former narcotics officers and others
[3:14:37.760 --> 3:14:43.600]  it going public saying it's all complete bull yeah leap and that's what I you know tell everybody
[3:14:43.600 --> 3:14:49.600]  always uh google leap law enforcement against prohibition that's a really hard one to uh
[3:14:49.600 --> 3:14:55.920]  argue and just one other thing like almost 85 percent of all kids smoke pot whether they're
[3:14:55.920 --> 3:15:00.400]  good or bad or rebellious or whether they tell you they aren't our kids are most likely your
[3:15:00.400 --> 3:15:04.720]  children are most likely gonna try smoking pot now here's the question you gotta ask yourself
[3:15:05.600 --> 3:15:10.960]  when they're gonna go do you want them to buy that pot from like some regulated safe
[3:15:10.960 --> 3:15:15.040]  source or do you want them to get it from a guy that sells crystal meth and crack cocaine well
[3:15:15.040 --> 3:15:22.400]  that goes back to alcohol poisoning just went way up some estimates three times most estimates
[3:15:22.400 --> 3:15:30.320]  five times alcoholism tripled during prohibition and it was bad alcohol and it's the same thing
[3:15:30.320 --> 3:15:35.600]  I mean I smoked some pot I never really liked it because you know I get quote paranoid when I smoke
[3:15:35.600 --> 3:15:45.760]  it uh I'm not gonna make a joke about Sunday but anyways but uh you know the whole point here is
[3:15:45.760 --> 3:15:51.920]  is that the whole point here is clearly marijuana is far less bad for you than alcohol and Kevin
[3:15:51.920 --> 3:15:55.840]  you have those statistics let's go over some of the government's own statistics about what
[3:15:55.840 --> 3:16:02.000]  prescription drugs alcohol I mean these are killing 400 500 a year combined the two numbers
[3:16:02.000 --> 3:16:05.680]  what one's 200 thousand there's about 300 thousand changed year to year but it's sometimes higher
[3:16:05.680 --> 3:16:11.280]  someone's lower and then marijuana they can't find deaths from it I mean you just can't find the
[3:16:11.280 --> 3:16:16.320]  deaths from it so it's an excuse to get in our lives it's an excuse they know the kids are using
[3:16:16.320 --> 3:16:21.040]  it that's why that's illegal more than 700 and we talked about been found in our drink skip the
[3:16:21.040 --> 3:16:26.320]  break and did you know that you have still going right hey John I want to talk to both we're uh
[3:16:26.320 --> 3:16:29.840]  we're on the internet right now but it's not the full audience but I want to be specific you know
[3:16:29.840 --> 3:16:36.640]  I've heard of this uh Ethan natalman's way you pronounce it yeah well this is really interesting
[3:16:36.640 --> 3:16:41.200]  I should have him on just as a guest separately sometime yeah no no I wanted to bring him on
[3:16:41.200 --> 3:16:46.640]  earlier I tried I tried but I know he'll he'll come on as a guest separately for sure what is the
[3:16:46.640 --> 3:16:51.600]  system going to do when like 98 percent of the public is smoked marijuana at one time or not
[3:16:51.600 --> 3:16:55.600]  they're live but they're still putting everybody in jail for it I don't know I mean this is just
[3:16:55.600 --> 3:17:00.720]  ridiculous if they're getting ready to have this 20 million man in March somewhere something like
[3:17:00.720 --> 3:17:06.960]  that that's gonna mark the 20 millionth marijuana arrest or something taking place in March well
[3:17:06.960 --> 3:17:12.160]  my mom remembers going to University of Texas back in the mid 60s if they caught you in marijuana
[3:17:12.160 --> 3:17:18.560]  it was like 50 years in prison I just got back from told Oklahoma or some guy met his best friend
[3:17:18.560 --> 3:17:26.960]  got six years for like a half a bag six meanwhile it's really in the histories that they grew tons
[3:17:26.960 --> 3:17:32.960]  of not just hemp for rope and sales and cloth but they grew the type of marijuana that actually has
[3:17:32.960 --> 3:17:38.720]  THC in it all over the colonies they exported all over the world and that for stomach aches all the
[3:17:38.720 --> 3:17:42.960]  same things it's medically used for today it had all that was one of the apothecaries you know they
[3:17:42.960 --> 3:17:47.680]  gave her the barbers of the doctors but but barbers were like for those watching kind of like mainline
[3:17:47.680 --> 3:17:51.760]  you know general look kind of like a nurse that you go to then they had doctors that were
[3:17:51.760 --> 3:17:56.800]  you know few and far between but that was one of their favorite remedies was marijuana and you can
[3:17:56.800 --> 3:18:04.240]  go read the you know online they've got copies of the old manuals where it talks about you know
[3:18:04.240 --> 3:18:11.280]  have them smoke the the bud you know the sexual organ of the plant that has the better effect
[3:18:11.280 --> 3:18:16.160]  smoke it and then you can read where even when he was president you see George Washington's
[3:18:16.160 --> 3:18:23.120]  doctors for toothaches saying smoke this in your pipe you know inhale it that's it George Washington
[3:18:23.120 --> 3:18:28.400]  jail time over arresting the one I mean listen you know you basically I guess you could say
[3:18:28.400 --> 3:18:33.920]  God left us with three categories you've got cocaine and then you've got the poppy opiates
[3:18:33.920 --> 3:18:38.960]  and then you got the THC drugs now we should get the the more powerful ones that can kill you
[3:18:38.960 --> 3:18:44.640]  that can shut down your breathing that could stop your heart those things are legal you can get
[3:18:44.640 --> 3:18:48.560]  those through a prescription have been forever I you know you get dental surgery they give you
[3:18:48.560 --> 3:18:54.080]  liquid cocaine you get your tonsils out liquid cocaine pharmaceutical grade um you know opiate
[3:18:54.080 --> 3:18:59.040]  derivatives or that's everything from Vicodin to Tylenol three to all the way to oxy cotton
[3:18:59.040 --> 3:19:04.240]  all of that's the whole opium based category and then you move into the the cannabis thing and
[3:19:04.240 --> 3:19:08.800]  they're like oh we've got this marinol pill or it's like taking one would be like you know it's
[3:19:08.800 --> 3:19:14.240]  just nothing well remember rush Limbaugh over and over again said he would defend those cocaine
[3:19:14.240 --> 3:19:19.920]  laws against blacks where if it was crack cocaine you get 20 years but if it was a lawyer with powdered
[3:19:19.920 --> 3:19:25.680]  cocaine you'd get a month or whatever or probation and Limbaugh still defends that even though he was
[3:19:25.680 --> 3:19:31.520]  caught taking 100 plus oxy cottons a day and what they want even more ridiculous about that law
[3:19:31.520 --> 3:19:36.240]  is that powdered cocaine is four times stronger than crack as far as like how much cocaine it
[3:19:36.240 --> 3:19:41.360]  crack is actually like poor man's coke you know it's like it's actually kind of like a ripoff
[3:19:41.360 --> 3:19:45.920]  really they they've mixed it with baking soda and it actually has very little cocaine in it
[3:19:45.920 --> 3:19:51.200]  i know it's it's addictive but it's just you know but that's what makes it classic it's actually
[3:19:51.200 --> 3:19:58.880]  weaker well the cia had the uh design you know the the uh recipe on that and they put it out
[3:19:59.840 --> 3:20:05.440]  they put it out on the street so just problem reaction solution that the cia got the recipe
[3:20:05.440 --> 3:20:10.960]  though from just hanging around in the streets of uh uh you know bogataw stuff where they have
[3:20:10.960 --> 3:20:16.320]  have you heard of this thing where they freebase marijuana it like heat so what's that called a
[3:20:16.320 --> 3:20:22.000]  vaporizer yeah yeah that's not free basing well i mean i know it's not free basing cocaine
[3:20:22.000 --> 3:20:27.040]  but i'm saying it's simple but that's vaporizing a plant we're going back to the full audience i
[3:20:27.040 --> 3:20:35.040]  understand that here we go kevin mooth the maker of american drug war available at info wars.com
[3:20:35.040 --> 3:20:39.520]  discounted in 1995 i hope you'll get it and show it to your friends family and neighbors this will
[3:20:39.520 --> 3:20:45.120]  even wake up the most stubborn not heads out there that's still uh i hear them call and talk radio
[3:20:45.120 --> 3:20:55.760]  all the time marijuana we gotta put them in jail uh but uh give me more whiskey uh let's uh get into
[3:20:56.880 --> 3:21:00.720]  the numbers and they vary year to year but it's always massive of what prescription drugs and
[3:21:00.720 --> 3:21:08.640]  alcohol kill and cigarettes kill versus the devilish mary jane well i the numbers in my film are that
[3:21:08.640 --> 3:21:15.440]  tobacco kills about 450 000 a year half a million a year alcohol about 150 000 that's just from uh
[3:21:16.400 --> 3:21:22.720]  health related issues uh a little under 100 000 from probably accidental yeah more than that um
[3:21:24.080 --> 3:21:29.920]  pharmaceutical drugs legal pharmaceutical drugs roughly 100 000 per year by the way those are all
[3:21:29.920 --> 3:21:34.480]  very conservative numbers from probably a decade ago i know you didn't research but they it's far
[3:21:34.480 --> 3:21:39.280]  worse to be conservative prescription prescriptions more like 300 000 but go ahead yeah it's worse
[3:21:39.280 --> 3:21:44.400]  that but but from where i'm coming from i i i'm conservative on purpose so i agree i mean i report
[3:21:44.400 --> 3:21:48.560]  an in game that governments only kill 200 million people last century it's more like 300 million i've
[3:21:48.560 --> 3:21:52.080]  been called out for that but we're gonna be conservative here you know well it's also to
[3:21:52.080 --> 3:21:56.080]  help we always say that the prison population two million and it seems like we've been saying that
[3:21:56.080 --> 3:22:01.200]  for some time yeah it's really four million behind bars about three million on probation yeah that sounds
[3:22:01.200 --> 3:22:09.360]  more like it um you know and then marijuana basically it is physically impossible for marijuana
[3:22:09.360 --> 3:22:14.560]  to shut down your heart or to stop your respiration if you if somebody could physically you couldn't
[3:22:14.560 --> 3:22:19.760]  smoke enough to od suppose like you melted it down into some substance and you drank it down
[3:22:19.760 --> 3:22:25.760]  and like cough syrup 10 pounds of marijuana the worst that would happen is you'd fall asleep
[3:22:26.400 --> 3:22:30.800]  you'd probably wake up and maybe you'd like trip and crack your head on the refrigerator while
[3:22:30.800 --> 3:22:35.280]  you're trying to like the worst you're gonna do is raid 711 for bluebell dutch chocolate

[3:22:58.320 --> 3:23:02.560]  puts it in this super heated chamber and then a lot of these higher end vaporizers what it does
[3:23:02.560 --> 3:23:08.960]  is it shoots the vapor into a plastic bag and then you inhale the vapor from the plastic bag
[3:23:08.960 --> 3:23:16.400]  i actually tried that at amsterdam and it's uh just very very cool because really smoking anything

[3:26:46.880 --> 3:26:53.200]  him yeah blimps the whole war on drugs for those that don't know is about cutting out their competition
[3:26:53.200 --> 3:26:58.960]  at the border and sending troops into kill growers of coca and other things in columbia
[3:26:58.960 --> 3:27:04.800]  them and then domestically it's about putting in jail it's a business they're cold-blooded
[3:27:04.800 --> 3:27:09.440]  they think it's real funny we've even heard g gordon liddy laughing on radio going at

[3:27:15.680 --> 3:27:21.680]  funny but that's i mean but really that's what anybody who thinks this is either a conspiracy
[3:27:21.680 --> 3:27:26.560]  theory or that thinks drugs are like but drugs are bad but drugs are bad you know this is not
[3:27:26.560 --> 3:27:31.520]  funny joke about you just need to keep telling you get you gotta know though that the people
[3:27:31.520 --> 3:27:35.600]  that are doing this are getting rich off of it and that's what's propelling it all you know
[3:27:35.600 --> 3:27:40.480]  it that that's well it's like from chicago to dallas where the cops throw fake chalk in your car
[3:27:40.480 --> 3:27:44.480]  and just take it because they want it absolutely i mean i've read seattle post intelligence
[3:27:44.480 --> 3:27:49.440]  or articles with the majority of bars are now owned by cops they go sell drugs to themselves
[3:27:49.440 --> 3:27:54.960]  in the bathroom then they seize your bar and then and then it's so corrupt the cops then hand the
[3:27:54.960 --> 3:27:59.360]  bars to their buddies but alice we got a brand new home v out of it
[3:28:03.440 --> 3:28:09.840]  whatever man i just can't believe how corrupt this country is it really is a dirt bag nation
[3:28:09.840 --> 3:28:15.600]  i mean i love the country itself in our history but we really are just this delusional evil
[3:28:15.600 --> 3:28:20.400]  i mean what's coming up with this crap when did everybody get so greedy when i was meeting
[3:28:20.400 --> 3:28:25.520]  designers when everybody got so greedy that they just didn't care anymore about the outcome of anything
[3:28:26.880 --> 3:28:30.400]  well that's the thing and so now the cops go along with this and the bankers are taking
[3:28:30.400 --> 3:28:35.120]  their pension funds right now then you know they're nationalizing pension funds in argentina
[3:28:35.120 --> 3:28:39.440]  they're getting ready to do it here the pension funds are invested in the stock markets they're
[3:28:39.440 --> 3:28:45.920]  going to call it oh we're nationalizing them to keep them safe we're rating them to keep them safe
[3:28:45.920 --> 3:28:51.520]  yeah the evil people always think they're in a bubble and that they're only screwing people
[3:28:51.520 --> 3:28:56.480]  and and that and that they're not going to get screwed mommy ask you this man how do you think
[3:28:56.480 --> 3:29:02.960]  george bush is going to spend the next four years of his life he never ran anything i mean that i mean
[3:29:02.960 --> 3:29:07.200]  that movie is all about how he's this idiot savant bumbling idiot oh poor thing they really
[3:29:07.200 --> 3:29:12.400]  thought wmds were in iraq i think it's disgusting i haven't seen he does i mean he'll still do what

[3:29:27.760 --> 3:29:31.280]  kevin during the break was bringing up something to me that i haven't really talked about yet
[3:29:31.920 --> 3:29:35.760]  what do you think the pardons will be like this time you know clinton murderers drug dealers
[3:29:35.760 --> 3:29:42.320]  cocaine smugglers white collar criminals israeli spies i wonder who george bush is going to
[3:29:42.320 --> 3:29:53.520]  pardon this time uh kevin i don't know uh john walters what about uh what about uh yeah you
[3:29:53.520 --> 3:29:56.640]  you're bringing up boogly oh so you know calling for his indictment for murder
[3:29:57.600 --> 3:30:01.280]  but if you believe the w film bush didn't know he's a nice person
[3:30:01.280 --> 3:30:09.760]  yeah well either way either way i just you gotta ask yourself though just the mentality
[3:30:09.760 --> 3:30:15.840]  behind us we're talking about greed of how much you know i wouldn't trade places with
[3:30:15.840 --> 3:30:21.760]  them with any of these people for a trillion dollars you know i mean what what did they get
[3:30:21.760 --> 3:30:25.440]  out of doing this what are they what are they getting out of it i know you could say power
[3:30:25.440 --> 3:30:33.040]  and money but i just it's like what power i mean i don't i don't i don't get it well it's it's a
[3:30:34.880 --> 3:30:41.360]  it's a competitiveness and they're all pushing for global domination and somehow they convinced
[3:30:41.360 --> 3:30:45.520]  the public that didn't exist and that government was loving and didn't have any avarice or any
[3:30:45.520 --> 3:30:49.120]  you know bad aims i mean have you been watching the news where they're just announcing world
[3:30:49.120 --> 3:30:53.040]  government to be run by the private banks and that matter though the ones that engineered it
[3:30:53.040 --> 3:30:56.960]  and it's all over the news even the new york times reports they're just keeping the money for the
[3:30:56.960 --> 3:31:02.640]  shareholders and five hundred million dollar bonuses for ceo's i mean i have to ask though that
[3:31:03.440 --> 3:31:08.400]  what kind of a world are they gonna have for themselves as they turn this entire planet into
[3:31:08.400 --> 3:31:13.200]  a giant toilet well they believe that that that actually secures their power they want to hurt
[3:31:13.200 --> 3:31:18.880]  people they want to make us all poor because that makes us easier to manage they don't want upright
[3:31:18.880 --> 3:31:24.000]  strong good people with good morals they want just a bunch of you know globalist controllers
[3:31:24.000 --> 3:31:28.320]  with a bunch of evil backstabbing scum down on the bottom all fighting with each other over
[3:31:28.320 --> 3:31:35.600]  diminishing resources yeah i could see that but then but then you know but then how fun it but
[3:31:35.600 --> 3:31:39.760]  then how are they gonna spend their lives i mean how are they like hurting people they like taking
[3:31:39.760 --> 3:31:44.080]  things away they love brain damaging children with mercury and fluoride but then what kind of but
[3:31:44.080 --> 3:31:48.800]  then what world are their children gonna live in well they're gonna live in in in cloistered
[3:31:48.800 --> 3:31:56.400]  defended uh you know areas i mean i'm telling you what they say i'm telling you that's the
[3:31:57.040 --> 3:32:02.000]  i mean just it's evil kevin you can't judge the world according to your own self who isn't evil
[3:32:02.720 --> 3:32:06.640]  do you really think like george bush is gonna like fit out the rest of his life and and
[3:32:07.280 --> 3:32:12.400]  profferter is at the front no he's gonna he's got a pleasure palace in dubai he's going over there
[3:32:12.400 --> 3:32:17.120]  he's going to do by yeah so it's cheney where they can you know well cheney likes girls he likes
[3:32:17.120 --> 3:32:22.240]  boys but i mean you know i'm serious i mean you know they're for michael jackson when it's
[3:32:22.240 --> 3:32:27.680]  where you can do what you want you know yeah so what do you think about palan do you think you
[3:32:27.680 --> 3:32:31.680]  think you think she's for real or do you think they just picked her knowing that she was going
[3:32:31.680 --> 3:32:36.720]  to make everybody just so i mean no no if she's meant to make mccain lose that's why they ran a
[3:32:36.720 --> 3:32:42.800]  guy who's a cancer patient yeah no i mean obama's the savior pal look i like river but i'm gonna get
[3:32:42.800 --> 3:32:47.680]  him on monday what really happened i heard him yesterday on genesis driving around the car on
[3:32:47.680 --> 3:32:52.720]  a hundred uh what is it nine point one and uh saying oh look at wall street they're all behind
[3:32:52.720 --> 3:32:59.600]  mccain wall street's given three times the money to obama than mccain and i'm not picking somebody
[3:32:59.600 --> 3:33:08.160]  here they're both bad but but obama is meant to win kevin oh i know i know but i mean you know
[3:33:08.880 --> 3:33:13.840]  our own people are drinking the kool-aid on this obama guy i'm just i'm just saying though that
[3:33:15.040 --> 3:33:20.800]  do you think they created sarah palan or do you think they just picked her because knowing how
[3:33:21.440 --> 3:33:27.120]  how it was really going to go over well that's how they that's how they pick you is is you've
[3:33:27.120 --> 3:33:31.040]  already been compromised you've already gone through the system they already know your modus operandi
[3:33:31.040 --> 3:33:37.280]  they already know your type and then they select you so the answer is both kevin in my humble opinion
[3:33:37.280 --> 3:33:42.240]  yeah i mean it's just you know things you know things like me just like seeing her shooting
[3:33:42.240 --> 3:33:49.040]  animals out of planes is like my final uh i guess that's offensive to me is you know
[3:33:49.040 --> 3:33:54.240]  oh what's wrong with shooting animals out of planes sounds fun i'm saying that you think
[3:33:54.240 --> 3:33:58.720]  that you do you think like she's really like that or you think that's just part of this whole
[3:33:58.720 --> 3:34:03.440]  act that they've portrayed to make you hate this person no there's nothing to do in alaska but
[3:34:03.440 --> 3:34:07.600]  shoot a caribou out of helicopters right so you really think that's really her oh yeah she's got
[3:34:07.600 --> 3:34:11.680]  the husband that's all into it yeah no i know i mean i know what they say i just want to help
[3:34:11.680 --> 3:34:16.560]  no no kevin kevin i actually if i close the door on a gecko well you've lived in texas
[3:34:17.360 --> 3:34:20.880]  you know the geckos are running in and out of your house i mean you know constantly finding
[3:34:20.880 --> 3:34:25.120]  them little cute little pink things and i really like them i watch them eat bugs up with the light
[3:34:25.120 --> 3:34:29.840]  at night and uh you know i'll close the door and cut one in half and i pick up this little bloody body
[3:34:29.840 --> 3:34:35.520]  and dig a little hole and bury it pull across there you know uh you know i mean i don't like
[3:34:35.520 --> 3:34:42.960]  as i've gotten older and more maternal i guess i don't like things but at the same time you know
[3:34:42.960 --> 3:34:47.360]  people that say don't hunt it's evil but then they go get a hamburger when the cow was tortured to
[3:34:47.360 --> 3:34:51.520]  death no i know what they're doing but i mean i understand you're saying the image of her shooting
[3:34:51.520 --> 3:34:55.840]  a wolf or fun i mean that that's different than flottering cows oh i didn't know she was shooting
[3:34:55.840 --> 3:35:02.480]  wolves yeah there's yeah she's shooting wolves and you have wolves so you don't like that yeah i mean
[3:35:02.480 --> 3:35:07.040]  it becomes like a personal issue for me i just wanted to see what your opinion is if that's like
[3:35:07.040 --> 3:35:10.880]  for real see that's i haven't paid much attention oh i didn't know she was running around shooting
[3:35:10.880 --> 3:35:17.280]  wolves yeah there's all kinds of petitions about that anyway i was looking for that hanging

[3:37:26.080 --> 3:37:31.120]  powered holograms which the pentagon even admitted in the 80s they were developing to fool people
[3:37:31.120 --> 3:37:35.840]  look i guarantee they're gonna have jesus pop up and tell everybody to take the microchip and
[3:37:35.840 --> 3:37:42.880]  they're gonna do it it'll be like a money python and being take the chip you know what you think
[3:37:42.880 --> 3:37:50.320]  about a religious i didn't see religious you didn't see it she doesn't see it
[3:37:51.200 --> 3:37:54.800]  hey have you heard bin laden on the eve of this election like every other election is gonna
[3:37:54.800 --> 3:37:59.120]  pop up with a new video for us and the government of course can announce that beforehand for us
[3:37:59.120 --> 3:38:04.960]  to get the media alive to me how stages have to get i know i was actually my i've got a friend of
[3:38:04.960 --> 3:38:09.520]  mine t sean is a uh he's a writer at saturday night live and i kept telling him i was like you
[3:38:09.520 --> 3:38:15.440]  guys should do a you guys got to do like a bin laden press release uh skit you know it would be
[3:38:15.440 --> 3:38:20.320]  perfect you know but have it where the they're in a cave and it looks just like like the white house
[3:38:20.320 --> 3:38:26.800]  brief pressing room with an official al-qaeda flag an official like al-qaeda logo behind them and
[3:38:26.800 --> 3:38:31.680]  everything like that and then you can have a mccain character like dressed up in tribal
[3:38:31.680 --> 3:38:37.360]  thing like i don't know but no that's this classic of course well i mean when the intel
[3:38:37.360 --> 3:38:42.240]  center that uploads these keeps uploading the video with their logo in the same video layer
[3:38:42.240 --> 3:38:52.720]  as al-qaeda's logo they have they really think we're stupid kevin i tell you you know we laugh
[3:38:52.720 --> 3:38:59.680]  about it but the big thing is they're getting ready for bio weapons releases and if people don't
[3:38:59.680 --> 3:39:04.160]  think people run our government won't kill 30 40 million of us you got nothing coming so let me
[3:39:04.160 --> 3:39:09.200]  ask you this i mean do you think it's it's a bad thing that so many young kids have gotten enthusiastic
[3:39:09.200 --> 3:39:16.160]  about obama yeah it's bad because see they're taking all the discontent make people think it's
[3:39:16.160 --> 3:39:21.920]  different because the guy's different colored skin and uh well just watch just watch what happens with
[3:39:21.920 --> 3:39:28.480]  obama what are you okay so what are you saying is gonna happen i mean he's all for the new world
[3:39:28.480 --> 3:39:34.480]  order banking system taking over he's all for youth brigades it's gonna be bad get ready it's gonna be
[3:39:34.480 --> 3:39:39.440]  real bad but the american people have never seen a scam they didn't love so you know
[3:39:42.080 --> 3:39:45.600]  i mean kevin they're openly taking all the bailout money and giving it to
[3:39:45.600 --> 3:39:48.800]  none of the in trouble institutions and just hoarding it all and giving it to themselves as
[3:39:48.800 --> 3:39:56.400]  bonuses and the new york times even reports i've got the quotes right here new york times
[3:39:58.640 --> 3:40:02.800]  came out yesterday i'm not talking about legal insider trading by corporate officers the
[3:40:02.800 --> 3:40:08.640]  financial press follows i'm talking about the ministers and executives and and it just goes
[3:40:08.640 --> 3:40:14.320]  on into all of it and it's got the new york times here with the quotes it's got um
[3:40:14.320 --> 3:40:16.320]  um
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:22.240]  it's got them recording the goldman sacks executives just bragging about how it's
[3:40:22.240 --> 3:40:26.880]  a great opportunity for them to consolidate and buy up more banks and give themselves record bonuses
[3:40:27.920 --> 3:40:31.200]  yeah i'm sure i mean just right out in the open they said we've got to have this a little
[3:40:31.200 --> 3:40:36.640]  bit of depression in two days and then they didn't pass it so they plunged the market and they
[3:40:36.640 --> 3:40:42.400]  threatened martial law of the congress did you know that yeah and then they said uh and then they
[3:40:42.400 --> 3:40:48.160]  said you know what we're just keeping all the money so what do you think is going to happen all
[3:40:48.160 --> 3:40:51.680]  this i mean how long i mean what happens when there's criminals running the government nothing
[3:40:51.680 --> 3:40:56.960]  can stop them the sky's the limit pal well we've been in that mode for quite some time yeah but
[3:40:56.960 --> 3:41:02.800]  i mean now they are just doing anything and everything that it is just it is just total
[3:41:02.800 --> 3:41:09.200]  corruption but how do you see this thing you think see this thing is just a slow ramping up of chaos
[3:41:09.200 --> 3:41:19.280]  yes who's incremental chaos yes i like that term good answer i'll be watching you sam kennison line
[3:41:22.400 --> 3:41:24.240]  kevin i can't get no respect you know that
[3:41:27.840 --> 3:41:34.960]  oh my god no respect no respect i can't think of any rodney danger field joke dang it i used to be
[3:41:34.960 --> 3:41:43.840]  able to fire off danger field it's now official uh russell crows talked about the movie the bill
[3:41:43.840 --> 3:41:50.240]  hicks movie yeah but we won't get into that i'll get into that i'm sworn to secrecy we're not
[3:41:50.240 --> 3:41:58.960]  going to get into that no i mean i'm here reading all this stuff kevin it's just it's just unbelievable
[3:41:58.960 --> 3:42:03.280]  and so now they're saying okay maybe we'll take 50 million of the multi trillion it's not a hundred
[3:42:03.280 --> 3:42:07.440]  billion and maybe we'll give 50 billion to banks that actually have mortgage trouble
[3:42:11.200 --> 3:42:16.800]  yeah i just like who are you gonna choose who to help or how to help you know that's uh
[3:42:18.160 --> 3:42:21.680]  it's a really odd problem here here's the jp morgan ceo
[3:42:23.440 --> 3:42:28.320]  as recorded by the new york times in a banking teleconference did and then they're all over
[3:42:28.320 --> 3:42:34.560]  the news saying this because what we do think is it will help us is perhaps a little bit more active
[3:42:34.560 --> 3:42:39.680]  on the acquisition side or optimistic side for some banks who are still struggling that means
[3:42:39.680 --> 3:42:45.200]  buying up banks and i would still assume that we're done on the acquisition side just because
[3:42:45.200 --> 3:42:49.440]  the washington mutual or bear stern's mergers i think there are going to be some great opportunities
[3:42:49.440 --> 3:42:56.640]  for us to grow in this environment and i think we have an opportunity to use the 25 billion
[3:42:56.640 --> 3:43:00.480]  in that way and obviously depending on whether recession turns into depression
[3:43:01.120 --> 3:43:04.640]  or what happens in the future you know we will have that as a backstop
[3:43:06.160 --> 3:43:09.520]  and then he goes on to say they're not going to give any of it to people in loans
[3:43:10.880 --> 3:43:14.880]  we got to do this to get credit going and they're literally just giving themselves bonuses
[3:43:14.880 --> 3:43:22.000]  goldman sacks england just the ink just that division is giving 14 billion dollars in bonuses
[3:43:22.000 --> 3:43:28.400]  to their executives out of the money directly that england gave and then in the us they just
[3:43:28.400 --> 3:43:32.880]  say we're keeping the money but all that secret read the bill congress passed you're not allowed
[3:43:32.880 --> 3:43:39.200]  to look at it i mean what i mean and then meanwhile they got cops raiding our houses
[3:43:39.200 --> 3:43:44.160]  looking for marijuana when the government ships in all the real dream i mean i'm tired of it man
[3:43:44.960 --> 3:43:50.560]  you have no legitimacy get out of my face well what do you think is going to happen do you think
[3:43:50.560 --> 3:43:56.880]  though that if it comes out and everybody finds out that obama was a big scam or that everybody
[3:43:56.880 --> 3:44:02.400]  becomes quickly disillusioned with the whole obama thing i mean don't you think now with
[3:44:03.040 --> 3:44:08.080]  all these younger people motivated that we could be closer to some sort of revolution
[3:44:08.080 --> 3:44:12.160]  yeah that's why they got the army ready and the brigade deployed the microwave guns
[3:44:12.160 --> 3:44:18.720]  but that's all meant to fail as well they want total breakdown they want depression kevin so
[3:44:18.720 --> 3:44:25.920]  um plus the medial puff obama up for a few years and then and then destroy him and then give you
[3:44:25.920 --> 3:44:30.000]  somebody else see their their experts at that they build them up they knock them down they go oh
[3:44:30.000 --> 3:44:36.640]  there's a new savior but the public is figuring out that scan by and large so i don't know i mean
[3:44:36.640 --> 3:44:42.080]  how far do you think this thing is going to go i mean do you picture it like gas stations closed
[3:44:42.080 --> 3:44:50.240]  grocery stores closed the gangs of people running through the street looking for food it could very
[3:44:50.240 --> 3:44:57.440]  easily get to that point i hope not you know i hope for the best prepare for the worst kevin
[3:44:57.440 --> 3:45:03.200]  yeah i just know this we need to arrest everybody the smokes marijuana immediate that's for sure
[3:45:03.200 --> 3:45:08.960]  that'll keep us safe not the 2000 deaths on the texas mexico border just this year the rocket attacks
[3:45:08.960 --> 3:45:14.560]  the murders cops being killed everywhere that's not a problem kevin of course all caused by the drug
[3:45:14.560 --> 3:45:20.400]  war even mexico's saying decriminalize now because they are now admitting that that's what's destroyed
[3:45:20.400 --> 3:45:26.240]  their country yeah didn't they didn't even uh the drugs are just agreed to some change in the
[3:45:26.240 --> 3:45:32.480]  mexican drug laws yeah because the whole society's falling apart i mean look the british used drug
[3:45:32.480 --> 3:45:37.200]  prohibition in china to bring it down because they could ship the opium in and then buy off the cops
[3:45:37.200 --> 3:45:43.600]  and locals again folks all these drugs will be dirt cheap and be looked down on societaly
[3:45:43.600 --> 3:45:49.040]  but you make it illegal and all the bling that everybody wants to do it i mean they know what
[3:45:49.040 --> 3:45:52.880]  they're doing folks when they lost alcohol prohibition they then criminalized drugs
[3:45:54.080 --> 3:46:00.080]  maybe our site he's gotta just crumble a little bit for everybody to readjust or something i don't
[3:46:00.080 --> 3:46:06.320]  know you know as far as the drug war ending because it has to i don't know
[3:46:09.360 --> 3:46:13.440]  they're never gonna stop there's roi heads who like swat team and like killing people and like
[3:46:13.440 --> 3:46:17.760]  stealing drugs and they're not going to stop they mean that they are the drug dealers they know
[3:46:17.760 --> 3:46:23.280]  they're shipping it most of them are on the take i mean i i just again our government is a rancid
[3:46:23.280 --> 3:46:29.040]  maggot covered pile of dead meat so what do you think we should do to take the country back
[3:46:29.040 --> 3:46:33.760]  right we should just point out that that that it's a pack of criminals running things and
[3:46:33.760 --> 3:46:38.240]  delegitimize it so they have no clout so it just grinds to a halt i mean the best thing we can
[3:46:38.240 --> 3:46:43.760]  hope for is just a collapse instead they want to have a controlled collapse to give them total power
[3:46:45.680 --> 3:46:51.680]  so we need to have we need to have a system where that doesn't happen kevin i'm gonna have
[3:46:51.680 --> 3:46:55.840]  to have you back up next week briefly kevin with the guest is uh the guest you wanted to set up
[3:46:55.840 --> 3:47:01.520]  ethan natalman probably got his time zone scrambled so he never called in he didn't call in

[3:52:14.160 --> 3:52:20.720]  put them in the slave systems okay well known as norah the nonviolent offender rehabilitation
[3:52:20.720 --> 3:52:30.080]  act at the proposition five will cut state cost and it's um this being backed by a lot of good
[3:52:30.080 --> 3:52:35.600]  people and it's and it's being fought against by some really bad people by the parasites
[3:52:35.600 --> 3:52:39.200]  yeah the people who are profiting from running the prison the parasites the potbelly demon
[3:52:39.200 --> 3:52:45.280]  creatures absolutely and and really they they're gonna lose a lot of money if they can't keep all
[3:52:45.280 --> 3:52:51.200]  these uh um nonviolent drug offenders behind bars for years and years and years because
[3:52:51.200 --> 3:52:54.640]  that's how they make their profit well now they're shifting into the fake environmental stuff you'll

[3:53:10.400 --> 3:53:16.560]  i do uh it's kind of getting its butt kicked in my opinion these these lists will allow heroin
[3:53:16.560 --> 3:53:22.000]  dealers to rape your children no it is really it has that uh that fine stein woman on here who's
[3:53:22.000 --> 3:53:26.800]  actually you know she's actually on the right side of several issues so it's a very very sneaky
[3:53:26.800 --> 3:53:35.200]  demon stein uh senator demon stein yeah oh she's saving us kevin yeah yeah no obviously she's not
[3:53:35.200 --> 3:53:41.280]  she's for the slave grid she knows where the cash is and they do you want meth dealers like playing
[3:53:41.280 --> 3:53:46.960]  with your children so that's another thing the government made all the stuff that got the the
[3:53:46.960 --> 3:53:52.480]  base ingredients of meth illegal so they so that so that the scum that makes it has to then find all
[3:53:52.480 --> 3:53:58.160]  these other sub ingredients uh so then it's full of all these toxins and poisons it just gets worse
[3:53:58.160 --> 3:54:02.480]  and worse so just what happened it's what happened with ecstasy when ecstasy first came out it was
[3:54:02.480 --> 3:54:07.920]  like this pure clean legal thing people used it for psychotherapy yes it could be abused but just
[3:54:07.920 --> 3:54:11.520]  so could anything anything else can be but then they made it illegal so they started labeling rat
[3:54:11.520 --> 3:54:16.240]  poison right so now you buy now you buy ecstasy and you can get this stuff that'll cause you to like
[3:54:16.240 --> 3:54:22.080]  uh like literally have a stroke and shut your brain off you know because you get it might as
[3:54:22.080 --> 3:54:31.360]  have the golden touch everything the government touches turns into horse poo they have the horse

[3:56:44.720 --> 3:56:49.680]  have a pit bull that attacked or killed something or somebody and instead of putting it to sleep
[3:56:49.680 --> 3:56:54.320]  they don't have the heart so they take it to one of these rehabilitation shelters and then some
[3:56:54.320 --> 3:57:00.000]  unlikely don't ask comes and he adopts it and then takes it to an off leash park where it comes
[3:57:00.000 --> 3:57:04.880]  and practically killed you know i actually found rudder down by access tv and then i took him in
