[00:00.000 --> 00:13.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.560 --> 00:40.640]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen
[00:40.640 --> 00:49.240]  it is the 15th day of July 2013 on this live Monday edition and Lord willing will be here
[00:49.240 --> 00:55.440]  for the next three hours and we're going to take phone call after phone call interspersed
[00:55.440 --> 01:04.840]  with amazing medical news pro-life news our criminal hijacked government funding Al Qaeda
[01:04.840 --> 01:12.560]  publicly big developments on that front in the first and second hour and then Mike Zula
[01:12.560 --> 01:21.560]  will be joining us in studio and Mike is of course the head of Sheriff Arpaio's cold
[01:21.560 --> 01:30.280]  case posse and he's going to be in studio with us coming up in the third hour here in
[01:30.280 --> 01:36.840]  Austin Texas now obviously I'm going to open the phones up on the whole Trayvon Martin
[01:36.840 --> 01:44.160]  situation but I want to open the phones up first in the first hour for the type of people
[01:44.160 --> 01:49.400]  that are all over info wars.com it is a minority it's a small number of people compared to
[01:49.400 --> 01:54.840]  the thousands of other comments but there are hundreds of comments out of tens of thousands
[01:54.840 --> 02:00.920]  saying I need to be killed not just Zimmerman needs to be killed and that the police all
[02:00.920 --> 02:06.600]  need to be killed and that the jurors need to be killed and the jurors need to commit
[02:06.600 --> 02:10.960]  suicide and of course you're seeing a lot of celebrities black celebrities say things
[02:10.960 --> 02:18.560]  like this and it is such a disgusting spectacle that it makes me physically physically nauseous
[02:18.560 --> 02:27.720]  to see things like this unfolding and how it still shows the dinosaur media with the
[02:27.720 --> 02:33.360]  government can change the subject whether Zimmerman did it in cold blood or not I think
[02:33.360 --> 02:39.080]  there was reasonable doubt just like with OJ or so many other cases and if there's reasonable
[02:39.080 --> 02:45.320]  doubt you must quit you must find not guilty and that's just how law works and the way
[02:45.320 --> 02:51.400]  the media can try to inject all this racial tension and you'll never hear anything out
[02:51.400 --> 02:57.080]  of the NAACP or the establishment black leadership that's run by the globalist about AFRICOM
[02:57.080 --> 03:02.280]  killing tens of thousands of innocent people a year destroying Libya or committing all
[03:02.280 --> 03:07.200]  these crimes or the al-Qaeda forces they put into control Libya killing 40 plus thousand
[03:07.200 --> 03:14.160]  people most of them blacks because some of the Wahhabist Arabs are very very racist no
[03:14.160 --> 03:22.840]  the only racism that can exist is white Anglo-Saxon Protestant or Catholic or whatever just if
[03:22.840 --> 03:28.520]  you're a white guy and you speak clear English you're the devil and it's just a diversion
[03:28.520 --> 03:35.680]  I know it's fun to hate for some people out there it's fun for the ignorant Klan and groups
[03:35.680 --> 03:42.520]  but the Klan does not have MSNBC and Al Sharpton behind them and it's meant to keep people
[03:42.520 --> 03:49.280]  in their own welfare controlled dependency controlled where basically all people in the
[03:49.280 --> 03:54.280]  inner city from when I see in the culture that's put out do is feel victimized and create
[03:54.280 --> 04:00.720]  a culture of separateness which is done in the name of multiculturalism and liberalism
[04:00.720 --> 04:06.240]  so you see how the eugenicist fake liberal racist have deployed this it's actually a
[04:06.240 --> 04:13.960]  stroke of genius in fact the Aryan nations the white supremacist all those groups really
[04:13.960 --> 04:23.520]  should love the Democratic Party and should love MSNBC because what it does is cause total
[04:23.520 --> 04:30.200]  division and Balkanization where people then segregate themselves and for that I am called
[04:30.200 --> 04:37.240]  a racist we're pointing out that 63% of the abortions in Texas are minorities similar
[04:37.240 --> 04:46.320]  numbers in Florida or New York that is racist for pointing out that Obama that the black
[04:46.320 --> 04:51.040]  unemployment has doubled under Obama that's on record that is racist so here I won't be
[04:51.040 --> 04:57.480]  racist put Zimmerman in jail put more fluoride in the black drinking water supply abort more

[08:54.240 --> 09:06.560]  head of sheriff joe arpaio's cold case posse mike zula in studio with us to break down his
[09:06.560 --> 09:13.120]  multi-year investigation of who obama really is and then there's no doubt we don't know who he is
[09:13.120 --> 09:19.680]  and that birth certificate is a fake there's no doubt and you always hear these establishment
[09:19.680 --> 09:25.040]  folks out there saying don't look at this don't investigate it you know it's kooky don't go there
[09:25.040 --> 09:32.480]  we didn't buy two billion bullets we're not spying on the press with the nsa the border bill is secret
[09:32.480 --> 09:36.480]  you can't see it but it doesn't give amnesty and then we get the bill and it has amnesty
[09:37.680 --> 09:41.920]  obama didn't run guns in a mexico to blame the second amendment and then the memos come out
[09:41.920 --> 09:48.000]  that indeed they did on and on and on oh the government isn't funding al qaeda oh the government
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.440]  is funding al qaeda all of this has come out and i actually got a clip i'm going to play later in
[09:53.440 --> 10:02.320]  the broadcast today from the five uh friday on fox where they say how dare these people support the
[10:02.320 --> 10:10.800]  fact saying that one of the brothers the surviving brother the patsy uh in the um boston bombing
[10:10.800 --> 10:17.120]  how dare him plead not guilty and how dare there be a group saying that he was set up
[10:17.120 --> 10:22.560]  up i mean because we've been told after they shot him up in the boat and tried to kill him
[10:22.560 --> 10:27.920]  and then the press got a video feed of the boat so they weren't able to uh make sure he was dead
[10:27.920 --> 10:32.240]  then he climbed out talking and then suddenly had his throat cut out and it looks like he's been
[10:32.240 --> 10:36.960]  tortured pretty bad we know his brother was working for the cia that's come out that's been
[10:36.960 --> 10:42.640]  confirmed back of the newspaper uh and you've got a drill going on with the stand down and their
[10:42.640 --> 10:49.680]  friends being executed by the fbi and fbi agents involved uh in investigating uh and their arrest
[10:50.640 --> 10:52.320]  are falling out of helicopters
[10:55.040 --> 10:59.840]  and now i was watching c span last uh friday and they were having hearings with the police chief of
[11:01.040 --> 11:05.920]  boston and they had some other homeless security people there and they said oh no we need robots
[11:05.920 --> 11:12.400]  everywhere looking for bombs and checkpoints and responses to ied's and it's the rollout of
[11:12.400 --> 11:18.560]  get ready for the domestic bombings it's going to happen this is how you bring in martial law
[11:18.560 --> 11:22.240]  if you're a foreign offshore crime syndicate that's hijacked the country so i'm gonna be
[11:22.240 --> 11:27.200]  getting into that after phone calls in the middle of the next hour i'm going to look at what's
[11:27.200 --> 11:34.640]  happened with the boston bombing because he's he's he's pled not guilty he's pled not guilty
[11:36.800 --> 11:41.440]  and that's because he's at least getting somewhat of a trial that hasn't been disappeared to getmo
[11:41.440 --> 11:47.440]  which they tried to do where oh he says he did it of course we torture people but hey i mean you
[11:47.440 --> 11:52.080]  know north vietnam tortured our pilots and they confessed and the good guys torture no the good
[11:52.080 --> 11:57.520]  guys don't torture tortures only good for fake confessions that is a well-known historical fact
[11:58.240 --> 12:04.000]  it's only good to terrorize the public are you saying our government has corrupt elements in it
[12:04.560 --> 12:09.280]  i mean what's wrong with torture see how far we've gone they've now announced that a few weeks ago
[12:09.280 --> 12:16.800]  it only hit the news today the law was repealed that we've had since the 40s that you can't
[12:16.800 --> 12:23.600]  have domestic propaganda pointed at the people by the pentagon and by the federal government
[12:23.600 --> 12:31.120]  using taxpayer money and in the article i saw that i'm going to get to there they're saying
[12:31.120 --> 12:36.320]  things like what's the big deal i mean we have other governments pointing propaganda at us rt
[12:36.320 --> 12:43.360]  al jazeera what's wrong with having government propaganda pointed at you here in america in
[12:43.360 --> 12:48.800]  fact here's the article u.s repeals propaganda ban spreads government made news to americans
[12:48.800 --> 12:54.160]  ladies and gentlemen when you turn on this one of the biggest issues when you turn on
[12:56.240 --> 12:57.520]  the nightly news
[12:57.520 --> 13:09.040]  and the messages are anti gun anti liberty anti freedom anti constitutional republic
[13:09.040 --> 13:18.160]  anti family anti second amendment anti uh common decency you know what the propaganda message is
[13:18.160 --> 13:25.600]  and it's come out for 70 years that hollywood's been involved in propaganda but now it is overtly
[13:25.600 --> 13:32.560]  anti human anti freedom and it's basically weaponized culture weaponized media pointed at
[13:32.560 --> 13:38.720]  the american people and it's a big whitewash article put out by foreign affairs a division of
[13:38.720 --> 13:44.240]  the washington post curt nemo cuts to the heart of it with his article up on info wars dot com
[13:44.240 --> 13:54.480]  cia will now openly propagandize americans smith mundit act reformed this month allowing cia to
[13:54.480 --> 14:01.120]  this to disseminate propaganda yeah it's not just the cia remember congress ruled in the congressional
[14:02.400 --> 14:08.640]  accounting office and they had several other investigations that it was illegal to use government
[14:08.640 --> 14:15.280]  money to try to get government legislation passed because legislation's supposed to come from the
[14:15.280 --> 14:21.280]  states and the representatives that are elected they're not from the central government using
[14:21.280 --> 14:29.120]  our tax money to try to affect the general public that makes the government itself uh the the
[14:29.840 --> 14:36.400]  propagandist with the upper hand to to to sell the takeover of society every authoritarian
[14:36.400 --> 14:42.960]  country has a state-run media and it's been done here really intensely the last 30 40 years
[14:42.960 --> 14:48.480]  intensifying before it was outwardly focused with a cold war but that that that propaganda comes
[14:48.480 --> 14:57.760]  back domestically now it's being focused in and directed against the american people and the american
[14:57.760 --> 15:03.520]  system and the bill of rights itself it's openly being directed against the constitution against
[15:03.520 --> 15:11.600]  the declaration of independence against any form of check and balance it is it is so over the top
[15:11.600 --> 15:19.040]  in its extremism that it staggers and beggars the mind there are no words to describe and and
[15:19.040 --> 15:27.360]  anytime this stuff comes out a micron of it will come out in one year the executive branch controlled
[15:27.360 --> 15:33.760]  by bush which is not supposed to be able to appropriate money and then direct it congress
[15:33.760 --> 15:40.400]  does that and then orders the executive to implement through the bureaucracy so you have a separation
[15:40.400 --> 15:48.240]  of powers but in one year eight billion dollars was spent by the federal government to promote no
[15:48.240 --> 15:57.040]  child left behind eight billion dollars in one year that the executive had in its propaganda
[15:57.040 --> 16:04.000]  slush funds on one program to federalize education that's what it really was and to get kids into
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.880]  the government trap when they're three years old not five years old god forbid they get any influence
[16:08.880 --> 16:13.840]  from their parents but parents aren't even parenting it's television anyways but they
[16:13.840 --> 16:19.600]  want to get their hands on them medically get the vaccines in them get the gmo in them get them on
[16:19.600 --> 16:28.000]  the state run path to identify with the state as mommy and daddy and you remember the commentators
[16:28.000 --> 16:33.840]  that came out the different radio hosts different tv tv hosts different journalists different
[16:33.840 --> 16:40.240]  syndicated columnists that you never hear about anymore who was it armstrong williams who got
[16:40.240 --> 16:47.520]  244 thousand dollars let's pull that up guys armstrong williams uh paid by white house and it
[16:47.520 --> 16:53.280]  was secret and then basically he was discredited the media said after it came out that he was given
[16:53.280 --> 16:58.000]  244 thou under the table just to write a couple news articles
[16:58.000 --> 17:07.440]  as a black conservative to sell conservatives on accepting what bush was doing and again it
[17:07.440 --> 17:14.240]  wasn't even bush there it is columnist dropped by syndicator over education department payments
[17:14.960 --> 17:22.000]  and excuse me i had looked at that in about five years it was 240 thousand dollars not 244
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.920]  seem to see my memory distorts when i was like younger than 30 it was photographic most of the time
[17:27.920 --> 17:33.520]  now as you get older and brain cells die i've noticed it's distorting like i said okay i
[17:33.520 --> 17:39.200]  believe that the british youth india company was founded 400 years ago and i was incorrect when they
[17:39.200 --> 17:49.040]  looked it up last week it was 401 years ago see the distortion i'll say uh bloomberg and ap reported
[17:49.040 --> 17:58.320]  that wells fargo echo via laundered 376 billion dollars in two years and it was 378 billion why
[17:58.320 --> 18:04.240]  did i shave two billion i don't know i don't know he was paid why did i just add four thousand
[18:05.360 --> 18:16.480]  he was paid 200 and 40 thousand dollars secretly by fake neocon conservatism and then they used
[18:16.480 --> 18:20.880]  that coming out as a reign of terror to make all the other writers and journalists get scared
[18:23.920 --> 18:30.160]  so that they would then go and sign national security agreements to actually be spies for
[18:30.160 --> 18:37.280]  the pentagon cia fbi uh other departments of homeland security oh yeah you didn't know that
[18:38.480 --> 18:43.520]  under project mockingbird and that's just an old system most of the major editors most of the major
[18:43.520 --> 18:55.680]  writers are actually doubling under infregard type programs as assets of different federal agencies
[18:55.680 --> 19:00.480]  themselves run by foreign offshore banks we ain't in kansas anymore and i only use the
[19:00.480 --> 19:07.120]  armstrong williams case just like i'll use giving smallpox blankets to indians to talk about bio
[19:07.120 --> 19:14.480]  warfare it's something most people know about there are thousands of admitted examples when i mean
[19:14.480 --> 19:20.960]  when you go see a movie and there's an anti-male uh thing presented or an anti-family thing or or
[19:20.960 --> 19:26.640]  the male's always an idiot the mom's always the boss that is to model humans model just like
[19:26.640 --> 19:32.800]  dogs model off the behavior they see so that so they model so that you go around and women
[19:32.800 --> 19:40.560]  when you go into a a trendy area they don't talk to men waitresses waiters cops bureaucrats they
[19:40.560 --> 19:46.960]  talk to the woman men aren't even to be talked to or listened to as slaves you've heard this for
[19:46.960 --> 19:51.680]  the house slaves of the women unless you work for the government then you're a hyper male

[23:14.320 --> 23:20.640]  will generate mass hysteria and chaos but i believe you should be informed about it because when the
[23:20.640 --> 23:25.920]  sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels only those who know this
[23:25.920 --> 23:33.040]  secret info will survive and thrive go to 123 conspiracy dot com right now to see the truth

[23:47.200 --> 23:54.320]  much darker go watch the video now at 123 conspiracy dot com before they shut it down
[23:54.320 --> 24:16.960]  again that's 123 conspiracy dot com
[24:16.960 --> 24:19.840]  all right i'm going to go to your phone calls in the next segment
[24:19.840 --> 24:26.480]  we're going to get uh new york tv newsman linol on it was a former uh miami
[24:27.520 --> 24:33.360]  prosecutor so he's going to be popping in to give us his take on how this this was a fraudulent
[24:33.360 --> 24:40.400]  trial at the bottom of the next hour then we've got a special guest uh joining us as well to
[24:40.400 --> 24:46.400]  break down uh who obama really is coming up in the third hour but the reason i i started the
[24:46.400 --> 24:52.720]  broadcast off today with the announcement of all the cia and the pentagon and every other federal
[24:52.720 --> 24:59.920]  agency is going to directly propagandize you because this isn't just news if you read what
[24:59.920 --> 25:07.760]  they're saying they're going to engage in psy ops openly well in a way that's almost good that we're
[25:07.760 --> 25:12.080]  going to have open state run media because i'm trying to explain to you that in the old days
[25:12.080 --> 25:18.000]  the fbi would come to somebody and say if you don't report like we want uh we're basically
[25:18.000 --> 25:23.840]  going to come after you and again most the fbi wasn't involved in this they had special divisions
[25:23.840 --> 25:28.640]  that did the political intimidation so the compartmentalized good guy fbi had no idea what
[25:28.640 --> 25:33.280]  was going on they had defense department people that did this uh jager hoover would get on a
[25:33.280 --> 25:39.200]  power trip and make directors uh give him uh edits of films early so he could approve it
[25:39.200 --> 25:44.240]  and this always happens in authoritarian regimes if you watch the lives of others that's based on
[25:44.240 --> 25:50.800]  a true story of the stasi spice grid in east germany uh you see the party officials over
[25:50.800 --> 25:57.120]  arts entertainment making all the most lovely uh tv and film stars and actresses have sex with them
[25:57.840 --> 26:04.480]  and approving what they liked and if someone didn't kiss their butt even if they were a communist
[26:04.480 --> 26:10.960]  that's finally what made the eastern germany fall was that they were even mean to other leftist
[26:10.960 --> 26:17.520]  and communist it was just authoritarian nightmare of course anything centralized will become authoritarian
[26:17.520 --> 26:23.360]  it's like creating 100 degree swamp water you're going to get amoebas in it you understand that
[26:23.360 --> 26:28.640]  that's kind of an analogy liberty is like subzero water there's not going to be any tyranny living
[26:28.640 --> 26:37.200]  in that but tyranny is that heats up to 103 degrees it is a living soup of parasitic crud
[26:38.400 --> 26:43.600]  and you let big government come in you have just brought in the ether in which this is allowed to
[26:43.600 --> 26:53.120]  grow conversely history has shown and i'm a hardcore libertarian no government creates an ether of
[26:53.120 --> 27:00.080]  just gangs and bedlam and then warlords that then form governments and generally people get sick of
[27:00.080 --> 27:04.960]  the warlords and no productivity then they get overthrown by more and more stable systems
[27:06.640 --> 27:08.560]  that's the problem with people like uh
[27:12.000 --> 27:16.080]  adam cochesius plans is these like we'll just we'll just see what happens we'll just get rid
[27:16.080 --> 27:20.960]  of the government and then we'll figure it out and i'm like really with the big mega corporations
[27:20.960 --> 27:25.120]  having all the power in their own paramilitary forces they will instantly come into that vacuum
[27:25.120 --> 27:29.280]  the globalist actually overthrow countries governments to create a vacuum to come in and do
[27:29.280 --> 27:36.640]  that i mean we're talking real world here ladies and gentlemen not pipe dreams you have anarchy
[27:36.640 --> 27:42.080]  you get hell on earth you get a big government you have hell on earth this is a fact this has
[27:42.080 --> 27:46.320]  happened over and over again and the biggest piece of evidence you've got of tyranny is not just the
[27:46.320 --> 27:50.320]  books written by the globalist and the council on fine relations and the club of rome that we
[27:50.320 --> 27:56.000]  bibliograph and films and shows and show you where they're at and please go look it up please go read
[27:56.000 --> 28:03.200]  the british ministry of defense 2007 global collapse model please go find out why they're
[28:03.200 --> 28:11.200]  getting ready why they want our guns please when you turn on the news or you turn on dramas and
[28:11.200 --> 28:20.480]  sitcoms and movies every show is anti-male anti-gun anti-liberty pro-abortion pro forced
[28:20.480 --> 28:30.240]  vaccines pro checkpoints pro martial law i saw two movies a few weeks ago uh action drama
[28:30.240 --> 28:35.360]  movies is what we happen to watch in bed late at night with my wife and both of them the cia was
[28:35.360 --> 28:41.440]  killing people's kids in front of them and at the end of the movie they're good guys for killing
[28:41.440 --> 28:46.880]  people's kids in fact i'm gonna look up the name of that during the break it's like numbers something
[28:46.880 --> 28:50.880]  one of the movies where the numbers and they broadcast out the numbers and then the hit teams
[28:50.880 --> 28:56.960]  go out but bad guys take over and then broadcast kill the cia guys and the hit teams and on and
[28:56.960 --> 29:01.520]  on and on and in the movie you know he kills the guy's 11 year old daughter and he kind of feels
[29:01.520 --> 29:07.120]  bad about it but it's okay because he's a good guy cold-blooded kills the girl because he knows
[29:07.120 --> 29:11.440]  it see i mean it's just sick and that's what they do in real life it's collateral damage folks
[29:12.960 --> 29:18.640]  in this country at least since the 60s they will send in paramilitary teams whether it's in
[29:18.640 --> 29:24.560]  Guatemala or or south vietnam or right here in the u.s and if they're at your somebody's house
[29:24.560 --> 29:31.680]  say killing gary webb if his kids would have been accidentally there they'd kill them folks that's
[29:31.680 --> 29:36.880]  called collateral damage you know where they blow up a wedding party and kill 100 plus innocent people
[29:36.880 --> 29:43.680]  to get one bad guy that they call a terrorist i saw time magazine had an article on drones and it

[33:31.280 --> 33:39.600]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live here on this monday worldwide edition of the transmission
[33:39.600 --> 33:47.760]  mike zulo will be joining us head of the cold case posse he says 100 percent proof
[33:47.760 --> 33:54.240]  that the birth certificate is completely fake and again they put out a fake one on purpose i believe
[33:56.160 --> 34:02.640]  to then create a debate about that instead of all of obama's policies it shows how sophisticated
[34:02.640 --> 34:08.880]  these guys are the whole kenya thing this is conclusive now was a diversion from who his dad
[34:08.880 --> 34:14.640]  really was they the the white house admits he writes in his own book dreams of my father
[34:15.760 --> 34:24.080]  about how he would go and spend summers with the famous communist pornographer black pornographer
[34:24.080 --> 34:33.680]  his dad unbelievable but they don't call it his dad he would go to be mentored and his grandfather
[34:33.680 --> 34:40.000]  was good friends with him and would bring him over there and you look it's his dad it's amazing
[34:40.000 --> 34:45.280]  no wonder his wife the first lady said over and over again until six years ago that obama was
[34:45.280 --> 34:51.920]  born in kenya no wonder his harvard documents said that he was born in kenya when he was the head
[34:51.920 --> 34:56.720]  of the harvard law review i mean that's their write-up in the magazine that came out quarterly
[34:59.200 --> 35:02.400]  imagine you're the head of the harvard review and there's the write-up about you and they had a
[35:02.400 --> 35:08.800]  write-up that went out to publishers for over 15 years hey uh you know do a book about obama this
[35:08.800 --> 35:17.360]  great guy and they did books the you know the kenyan-born guy that came to america and became
[35:17.360 --> 35:22.960]  the head of the harvard review and then chris mathews goes it's insane to say that we haven't
[35:22.960 --> 35:27.680]  given the birth certificate for four years remember they go this is the birth certificate a receipt of
[35:27.680 --> 35:35.520]  it a modern printout everybody's like that's the printout and then finally go oh you're right here
[35:35.520 --> 35:41.200]  it is and you look at it it's in layers on purpose with the different layers of fake stuff and they
[35:41.200 --> 35:47.520]  used a font that's the typewriter font to make it look like a typewriter but it's not a typewriter
[35:47.520 --> 35:54.640]  because the letters are identical they have fake splats on them microscopic splats but they're
[35:54.640 --> 36:05.040]  all unified it's open and shut completely fake it'd be like if every snowflake falling out of the
[36:05.040 --> 36:10.560]  sky was the same snowflake those aren't natural snowflakes it'd be like if you went in a house
[36:10.560 --> 36:14.400]  that had thousands of fingerprints but they were all the same fingerprint you'd say that you know
[36:14.400 --> 36:19.040]  this is not more people's fingerprints this is one set this is the type of stuff but he's got
[36:19.040 --> 36:27.920]  dozens and dozens and dozens in fact I told Zulo last week or through the producer to bring his
[36:27.920 --> 36:32.720]  exhibits if you wanted to to email those to you guys did he indeed send the exhibits because I'd
[36:32.720 --> 36:40.240]  like to go over the exhibits on air the affidavit good well we'll go over any exhibits that they
[36:40.240 --> 36:46.560]  also have online for TV viewers for radio listeners I will direct you where the affidavit is because
[36:46.560 --> 36:53.280]  they're going ahead with a lawsuit over this so he's going to be in studio with us on that subject
[36:55.040 --> 37:01.760]  now I haven't gotten into Trayvon Martin yet I started the broadcast out going oh look here is
[37:01.760 --> 37:11.760]  mainstream news admitting that our media is going to be directly targeted and the public's
[37:11.760 --> 37:17.040]  going to be targeted with propaganda and with psychological operations now this has already
[37:17.040 --> 37:21.040]  been going on it's kind of like the NSA's been spying on us forever but now it's going to spy
[37:21.040 --> 37:27.200]  and record everything you ever do forever and pre-crime track you without warrants totally
[37:27.200 --> 37:35.120]  illegal and they're just going what are you going to do to us and now they come out and go oh yeah
[37:35.120 --> 37:44.000]  we're going to have Voice of America and its hundreds of sitcoms and dramas and soap operas
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.720]  and by the way you know what these soap operas are take your shots
[37:50.240 --> 37:55.520]  all that you know the you know the classic brainwashing all the conditioning and now it
[37:55.520 --> 38:00.240]  allows those funds to flow and even covert propaganda planted in newspapers they're just
[38:00.240 --> 38:05.600]  saying oh we're saying it's legal now we're saying we can torture you and disappear you if you want
[38:05.600 --> 38:09.680]  the president signed the NDAA he can do it every once he can decide to kill whoever he wants
[38:09.680 --> 38:13.200]  including us citizens who needs judges who needs juries who needs indictments
[38:14.880 --> 38:19.200]  why do you think they're bringing in this culture of total tyranny because they're going to hammer
[38:19.200 --> 38:25.600]  the economy take the bank accounts and irrevocably turn america scientifically into a tyranny
[38:25.600 --> 38:33.200]  and that's why there's bipartisan support for this because the words gone out hey you get
[38:33.200 --> 38:38.640]  with the program or you get dead or you get put in prison or you get shut out of the power structure
[38:38.640 --> 38:45.840]  and all the moolah but the problem is when everybody sells out everything collapses
[38:47.840 --> 38:51.680]  i use the analogy of pornography i saw a wall street journal article a few months about it
[38:51.680 --> 38:58.480]  a few months ago women supermodel type women that were being paid 10 20 30 thousand dollars per
[38:58.480 --> 39:06.400]  pornographic shoot are being paid maybe a thousand dollars now many women end up doing it for free now
[39:07.120 --> 39:11.440]  just so they can promote their website and try to get a fan base try to make money off that
[39:11.440 --> 39:16.720]  because everybody went in the economy the last 20 years and it went from thousands of women doing
[39:16.720 --> 39:22.480]  porn to tens of thousands of women doing porn to hundreds of thousands of american women now
[39:22.480 --> 39:30.320]  engaged in hardcore pornography and then women started doing more and more bad things for their
[39:30.320 --> 39:36.160]  body more and more uh disgusting things more and more degrading things and now they can't even get
[39:36.160 --> 39:44.080]  paid extra money to do unspeakably disgusting unhealthy horrible things and if you criticize
[39:44.080 --> 39:49.040]  it you're a square and you're anti woman and you're anti their freedom yeah to have some
[39:49.040 --> 39:54.720]  russian gangster break their jaw and put cigarettes out on them and yeah you're right i'm trying to
[39:54.720 --> 40:00.720]  steal the women's wonderful rights it's it's uh you know i i uh gay men had the lowest
[40:00.720 --> 40:08.080]  live expectancy in this country on average and have on average over 200 partners a year and and and
[40:08.080 --> 40:12.880]  die alone without children and without family i don't hate them for what they do sexually
[40:12.880 --> 40:19.120]  i don't even judge them i'm just simply saying why is this being force fed why is this being
[40:19.120 --> 40:23.360]  promoted i mean i i mean i've covered a rolling stone article but i already read this in other
[40:23.360 --> 40:28.480]  medical journals but rolling stone article about 10 years ago called bug chasers where from san
[40:28.480 --> 40:35.760]  francisco to new york the trendy thing is to get hiv and so men go try to go out and and and and
[40:35.760 --> 40:42.400]  get it to then show their family they're truly gay and really show their parents you know uh
[40:42.400 --> 40:47.120]  that they've committed to it i mean it's human sacrifice that's going on
[40:50.080 --> 40:56.240]  and what do they push now to five-year-olds in programming on cartoon network and nicolodian
[40:56.240 --> 41:02.400]  on record to five-year-olds teaching them not just how to have sex which would be bad enough
[41:02.400 --> 41:08.320]  but what are you doing sexualizing children but confusing their gender and trying to teach them
[41:08.320 --> 41:17.360]  about not just homosexual sex but other forms as well i mean this is a pervert crazy government
[41:18.240 --> 41:22.800]  that's so decadent all they've got is targeting children and that's what happens in every culture
[41:22.800 --> 41:28.720]  in history when it becomes decadent and goes into these cycles we're sitting here watching this so
[41:28.720 --> 41:34.480]  when you see all this ladies and gentlemen you wonder why every show is anti-regular father
[41:34.480 --> 41:40.400]  every show is anti-family and is pro break up the family or have foster parent families run

[43:14.720 --> 43:20.640]  they use gay people as the vector in new york to spread hiv that's been declassified with hiv in
[43:20.640 --> 43:29.200]  look it up with hiv in the hepatitis shots in the 1970s the bayer pharmaceutical putting hiv
[43:29.200 --> 43:36.880]  in the factor eight putting hepatitis folks they don't care about you but it becomes your identity
[43:36.880 --> 43:41.680]  until they caught a bunch of people trying to get the texas capital with bags of feces
[43:41.680 --> 43:46.240]  urine blood bloody tampons i'm sorry to talk like this this is associated press
[43:46.240 --> 43:55.760]  to throw it on the pro-lifers and the people in the legislature and they run around spitting on
[43:55.760 --> 44:01.840]  people screaming and yelling demonically saying i love you satan hail satan we've i mean we've
[44:01.840 --> 44:07.280]  played it ladies and gentlemen i'm right down the street from it we sent jacari down there and he
[44:07.280 --> 44:13.920]  got people just freaking out flailing around like it was some type of demonic voodoo ritual or something
[44:13.920 --> 44:24.240]  these women covered head to toe in satanic tattoos screaming hail satan with bags of poop
[44:26.080 --> 44:32.240]  because that's all they've got is look i'm gonna be bad i'm gonna show you that's their
[44:32.240 --> 44:38.400]  possession now not a good job not having kids not having a good husband not having some goats and
[44:38.400 --> 44:44.480]  chickens in the backyard and growing things and being loving no being demonic hobgoblins
[44:44.480 --> 44:49.280]  running around foaming at the mouth that's what happens in every culture that gets decking it
[44:49.280 --> 44:56.560]  it always roam babelon the aztecs you know history people end up cutting themselves tattooing
[44:56.560 --> 45:03.760]  themselves running around human sacrificing wallowing in poop japan the most popular shop
[45:03.760 --> 45:09.040]  in japan look this up are our poop shops and i got families listening i'm not going to go any
[45:09.040 --> 45:14.400]  further into this the whole point is is that there are vending machines everywhere i'm not even
[45:14.400 --> 45:19.200]  going to get into what's going on things you can't even imagine uh bloomberg reported the number one
[45:19.200 --> 45:27.840]  seller in japan now is is diapers for men and women not not depends because you you don't you
[45:27.840 --> 45:34.160]  have incontinence it is the it is the relished pleasure of large sections of the japanese
[45:34.160 --> 45:43.360]  to to wear diapers and to defecate on themselves and and to sit around watching tv and doing it
[45:43.360 --> 45:48.400]  right out of idiocracy and and ladies and gentlemen if you think i'm joking and there it is adult
[45:48.400 --> 45:54.240]  diapers the past new trend among japanese women and of course with the japanese cleanliness was
[45:54.240 --> 46:01.440]  their culture being clean taking two big hot baths a day scrubbing their skin being the cleanest
[46:01.440 --> 46:06.800]  culture on earth but see how do you become decadent how do you show people i'm desperate i'm scared
[46:06.800 --> 46:11.680]  i'm freaking out i don't know what to do with all this electromagnetic radiation and this and this
[46:11.680 --> 46:18.560]  tv culture and the breakdown of the family what do we do we commit suicide culturally and i'm not
[46:18.560 --> 46:22.960]  knocking you if you got tattoos is it right of passage you were in the military i see some neat
[46:22.960 --> 46:29.600]  tattoos it's an art form i get it got friends with tattoos i get it my wife's got a pretty
[46:29.600 --> 46:36.960]  rose tattoo on her back she's had since college whatever the point is is that in cultures when
[46:36.960 --> 46:42.400]  the people start getting tattoos and cutting themselves and and and and changing their body
[46:43.440 --> 46:48.560]  look at the old testament every culture that did that oh my gosh get ready it's a sign
[46:48.560 --> 46:59.040]  millions of diapers in japan are sold a day for adults and everybody sits there in their
[46:59.040 --> 47:05.920]  office or at the factories pooping on themselves and celebrating it that's that that's the new
[47:05.920 --> 47:12.800]  that's their right that's their right to put a diaper on and to do this all day and to stink
[47:12.800 --> 47:19.520]  and you are a square i mean what do you call it if you're bigoted uh you know you say hey the family's
[47:19.520 --> 47:25.200]  okay i guess it's bigoted i'm a bigot maybe i'll be hauled up by the un international tribunal
[47:25.200 --> 47:30.640]  for being a bigot because i'm saying it's wrong to do things like that and so that's all we've got
[47:30.640 --> 47:34.560]  now and and and the black community's been programmed more than anybody that what their
[47:34.560 --> 47:39.120]  possession is that they've been abused they've they've been treated bad everybody's out to get them
[47:39.120 --> 47:45.680]  all the whiteies are racist and that they can be racist and say kill whitey that's okay and then
[47:45.680 --> 47:50.880]  don't expect whitey to then become and i and i told you i would expect i i said last friday i said i
[47:50.880 --> 47:55.200]  believe i'ma say this for months that zemmerman would be acquitted because the charges were too
[47:55.200 --> 48:01.680]  strong and there's reasonable doubt and i said i thought there would be moderate riots in californium
[48:02.800 --> 48:08.000]  florida detroit and new york and there have been unrest and when it's being broken and things being
[48:08.000 --> 48:14.320]  set on fire and highways being blocked and people being assaulted but they called a protest oh tv
[48:14.320 --> 48:20.000]  reporters got their cameras taken and surrounded and beat up a protest really i just walk up to a
[48:20.000 --> 48:26.240]  camera guy and break their jaw and go protest just kind of like it's protesters when the government
[48:26.240 --> 48:32.080]  uses al-qaeda to attack libya and syria and all these places so it's a protest but america gripped
[48:32.080 --> 48:37.920]  by second night of fury over not guilty verdict for neighborhood watchman uh who shot black teenagers
[48:37.920 --> 48:43.120]  armed only with a bag of skittles well he was armed with his fist and was reportedly on top of
[48:43.120 --> 48:48.320]  him beating him but i don't know that's what witnesses said reasonable down i don't know
[48:48.320 --> 48:52.720]  that oj for sure killed his wife even though he's found guilty in a civil trial so if there's
[48:52.720 --> 48:58.960]  reasonable down he walks did you see white people going out and rioting and burning things down
[48:58.960 --> 49:03.120]  burning down the house when that happened even though it was sold as racial and some black folks
[49:03.120 --> 49:09.840]  went out and celebrated because again their identity is in being victims not all black folks but a
[49:09.840 --> 49:15.680]  large minority of black folks joined by white anarchist and hispanic anarchist that's who's
[49:15.680 --> 49:20.080]  doing it who just want to go out and have an excuse i saw some of the videos of people blocking the
[49:20.080 --> 49:26.080]  highway be one thing of a protest blocked the highway i'd say it's a demonstration i get it
[49:26.080 --> 49:32.000]  but people bowing up walking up with their fists clenched by vehicles i don't care what color you
[49:32.000 --> 49:39.040]  are you come up to me with your fist bowed i've grown up and learned not to get so angry but there
[49:39.040 --> 49:44.800]  might be a problem i was hiking up a big 10 foot wide trail yesterday and i had earphones and listened
[49:44.800 --> 49:50.000]  to a book on tape and this this this mountain biker had decided i mean you're talking about going
[49:50.000 --> 49:56.640]  up a big hill he could see me for a hundred yards he got in the rut i was in and came up behind me
[49:56.640 --> 50:03.760]  me and at the last second i see him and began to step aside and he hit me with the handlebar
[50:03.760 --> 50:07.680]  and i went hey man what's the etiquette here and the guy looks back and ignores it with
[50:07.680 --> 50:14.640]  earbuds and keeps going and i went hey that that is really aggressive and the guy kept going and i
[50:14.640 --> 50:20.080]  kind of jogged up to the top not to have a fight but the guy got this car looking at me and drove
[50:20.080 --> 50:25.280]  off it was like that was his sacrament was the it's like it's like gang activity was to bump me
[50:25.280 --> 50:29.920]  and i saw these people blocking the highway and bugging their eyes out you know black guys at
[50:29.920 --> 50:34.960]  white drivers and i mean i would probably flip out folks somebody's like bowing up blocking my car
[50:34.960 --> 50:40.080]  i mean i don't care if you're black white whoever you are i'm praying to god that i wouldn't get
[50:40.080 --> 50:45.040]  angry but i mean this is really aggressive stuff and it's and i'm telling you if the media keeps
[50:45.040 --> 50:50.000]  hyping it you're going to see regional dining you're gonna see white people's faces beat in
[50:50.000 --> 50:56.880]  on the highway and in MSNBC will say that's good now it's even things out so i say we randomly

[54:21.760 --> 54:26.960]  up when we start the next hour i want your take on all of what's happening but this is globalist
[54:26.960 --> 54:31.600]  corporate propaganda through the government controlled media to create racial division
[54:31.600 --> 54:35.840]  in this country and of course i'm being sarcastic about you know let's sacrifice white people
[54:35.840 --> 54:42.640]  publicly to prove that you know we're sorry in a tone for our evil it is so frustrating to see
[54:42.640 --> 54:50.640]  this cosmology i mean do black folks or anybody else in this country know that until the 1880s
[54:50.640 --> 54:57.840]  german white slaves called serfs were being whipped and imprisoned for not doing their work or running
[54:57.840 --> 55:08.160]  away the last german province in the 1880s outlawed slavery served them uh there were areas you know
[55:08.160 --> 55:15.840]  in in cuba in places that didn't outlaw until then do do people know that white uh people by the
[55:16.400 --> 55:23.760]  hundreds of thousands conservatively every few decades would be impressed by european navies
[55:23.760 --> 55:31.200]  conked on the head by a press gang and children men you name it and drug to be slaves on ships
[55:31.200 --> 55:38.400]  you were slaves i mean they would kill you if you didn't follow orders they would whip you with a
[55:38.400 --> 55:43.760]  cat or nine tails and a lot of times you died from that or drag you from stem to stern under the
[55:43.760 --> 55:49.040]  boat with all the barnacles it's called keel hauling oh they didn't make a roots about that
[55:49.920 --> 55:55.680]  when you see amas toss or all these amastead or whatever it is movie i saw it and it's just
[55:55.680 --> 56:00.960]  black people being beaten the whole time on ships do they ever show you what went on to the people
[56:00.960 --> 56:06.960]  that were slaves in the navy what do you think the draft comes from it's just a modern version
[56:06.960 --> 56:13.120]  but this was where they would hang you the third time you talked back to an officer
[56:14.720 --> 56:21.200]  hang you oh but no one knows about that even though it's a mainline history because it doesn't fit
[56:21.200 --> 56:27.040]  into the cosmology so it's wide open phones anything you want to talk about but i'd like
[56:27.040 --> 56:35.440]  to get your take on i told you that he would get off and i told you uh that he would walk and i told
[56:35.440 --> 56:43.280]  you that i would imagine some sporadic rioting and and and light violence and that if the media
[56:43.280 --> 56:49.520]  then encourages it and says it's a good thing you're going to start seeing people get drug out of
[56:49.520 --> 56:53.520]  their car it's only a matter of time folks till people get drug out of their cars there's already
[56:53.520 --> 56:57.920]  cameramen getting roughed up and people getting their cars shooken and robbed and stuff and the
[56:57.920 --> 57:01.760]  media is kind of burying that in the back of the paper instead of saying that's bad behavior
[57:02.400 --> 57:07.040]  because the demonstration is not going out and beating up a cameraman from a news station
[57:07.040 --> 57:13.040]  as if they did something to you i guess they're white that's enough this is unbelievable and
[57:13.040 --> 57:17.520]  it's just an excuse to act out and be tribal and it's this democratic party idea that you

[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:42.960]  where the only thing they've got out there black white doesn't matter is a culture of
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:48.320]  political correctness and obsessions with it and it's we're going to go over some of those photos

[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:09.760]  british press playing along with it but the daily mail's got a huge article with photos and videos

[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:04.560]  and uh there's a ron paul article we're gonna get to all of it here but i want to go to your phone
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:10.400]  calls let's go to one right now let's talk to shon in canada what's your perspective as a canadian
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:17.600]  on this three ring circus i think it's clear that the media is acting as uh in a provocateur
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.720]  fashion and they're just trying to stir the pot and uh and create chaos it's it's unbelievably
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:28.000]  irresponsible and it's going to have deadly consequences and um you know i'm always i'm
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:35.040]  always shocked at how far these people go in and they're lacking morals and scruples it's incredible
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:39.680]  well i i mean i just don't get how the media defends people randomly roughing up camera men
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:44.960]  just because they're white from a news station i mean being white you you're not inherently evil
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:49.120]  and this is the opposite of what martin luther king talked about judging people off the character
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:56.160]  of what they do i mean it was a white guy yesterday that bumped me with his bike for literally on purpose
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:02.560]  it's like a 10 foot wide path i'm on the side i'm supposed to be he's coming up he he he you know i
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:08.240]  hear get out of the way right when he hits me and i mean i just liked him because of what he did
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:12.880]  not because he was white i mean if he'd have been a black guy i'd have been mad at him you know it
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.960]  was because he was a jerk and some of these bike riders i'm telling you if i open the phones up
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:21.920]  people would call in about it they're just running into people they believe they're god not just with
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:27.680]  cars they believe they're god with pedestrians i'm sorry go ahead no it's okay it's that guy it's that
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:32.880]  uh snobby smug green thing where uh you're better than everybody else because you're
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:37.520]  you know you're reducing your carbon footprint and the whole global warming hysteria you get
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:41.200]  to feel good because you know you're you're part of that trendy new movement that's supposedly
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:45.360]  saving guy on mother earth but it's um but it's just ridiculous well you know if they did that
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.800]  later i would buy into it because i don't think fossil fuels are good overall obviously but
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:53.840]  it's what we got right now if they were worried about gmo's and the real big threats and kim trailing
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:04:01.200]  then i'd listen but it's all about paying taxes to the devos group basically yeah well i just hope i
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.680]  hope uh the the violence is quelled and this doesn't go any further obviously this is just more
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:11.760]  anti-gun uh agenda stuff and um and and racial divide and conquer and it's just disgusting and
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:18.080]  deplorable and um no i agree with you they have successfully now fused racially being anti-gun
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.080]  that's why so many hispanic immigrants because they think the government's their friend because the
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.560]  government gives them free stuff our vote anti-gun well why wouldn't you want a gun you just left a

[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:18.160]  have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche from compulsory
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:24.560]  state education to the hollywood media brainwashing machine we are kept in perpetual bondage to the
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:29.920]  ideas that shape our actions when somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:34.160]  testing it out and verifying it they can take total control of your awareness all of this is
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:40.080]  happening so fast you need to be ahead of the game how to engineer the opinion of the american people
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:46.320]  so that they would not only endorse but demand a war another one another plane just

[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:12.400]  rulebook big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:21.360]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:29.520]  let me tell you what tyranny is it's when corrupt influences get control of the economy
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:34.640]  and the economy is no longer about what you actually produce and what you stand for and
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:42.240]  the quality it's about whoever is in charge and how big their gang is and then productivity
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:48.320]  implodes the society then collapses but the globalists have openly said they believe high
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:54.080]  technology is going to now change that that's why they call their takeover barter and rustle and
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:09:00.960]  others julian huxley aldis huxley the club of roam call it the final revolution of the technocrat
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:09.520]  and that's why you see the debos group and bill berg and the eu and the pentagon and all of them
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:14.640]  calling themselves technocrats and that term the final revolution
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:21.360]  and it's scientific how they manipulate people but once you're aware of the trick
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:28.000]  then it's like oh that's so simple it's like the trick of a rabbit the rabbit's in the box and
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.480]  then suddenly you spend the box around now the rabbit isn't but you slid down a mirror
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:40.320]  that looks like the inside of the box to create the illusion the rabbit didn't really disappear
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:46.000]  just like it's not in the hat then it's in the hat it's got a compartment in it the hat
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:53.440]  but you tell a three-year-old that sees a rabbit trick no no honey the rabbit was already in there
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:59.680]  or the hat's sitting on a table that has a trap door in it and he pulls the rabbit up
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:04.880]  into the hat and then out and the three-year-old will say no it's magic he pulled the rabbit out
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:10.720]  and that's what's so frustrating i don't want to sit here and talk about dravon martin and jordz emmerman
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:16.960]  i don't want to sit here and weigh in on all this race garbage people love it people are primitive
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:22.800]  on all sides it's fun for people to divert and to get into a group think because we're not allowed
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:28.880]  to have any type of group culture or group identity unless it's authorized by the mainstream media
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:35.920]  and then it's supposed to be anti-white and that's only because whites are the supposed majority
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:40.400]  not anymore and so they've got to be guilted into politically doing whatever they're told
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:45.840]  oh you're pro-gun that's because you're racist let's turn our guns in for dravon
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:56.400]  that's what we're hearing from the white house and the white house is so concerned about one
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:03.280]  dead black man but they're not concerned about 40 000 conservatively last time i checked dead libeans
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:11.760]  most of them black packed up by saudi arabians and kataris brought in videos to type in libian forces
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:19.920]  western forces libian rebels kill blacks and you'll just see just hundreds of videos of them
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:25.760]  chopping men women and children up with machetes because they don't want black libeans in north
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:31.840]  africa i mean if blacks can't be in africa where can they be but no one cares about that except
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:38.640]  for synthia mckinney and people that actually have a brain on their shoulders no it's all about
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:45.840]  hating whiteing as a political diversion and if you go to info wars dot com
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:53.520]  oakland police stood down as protesters terrorized drivers assaulted camera people
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:59.200]  attack news trucks attack police cars cops were in cars that got them windows knocked out what the
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:04.800]  cops do they ran and cops didn't respond i mean if you talk back to a cop i don't care if you're
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:08.960]  black or white you're going to get your head beat in in most areas you're going to get a
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:13.760]  proctology exam you know just to show you oh you talk back i'm going to catheterize you now as a form
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:19.600]  of torture oh but my goodness they've been told you stand down why is that because they're wanting
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:25.680]  riots ladies and gentlemen just like when daryl gates stood down in the la riots that's what's
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:32.560]  being pushed here because the higher ups want a diversion from the nsa gate the irs gate uh the
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:38.320]  corruption going on with all these appointments of people to ambassadorships for money uh
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:42.480]  transparency suffers the state department fails report where they're spending money what they're
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:47.680]  doing that's not transparency that's open crime going on government on purpose is refusing to
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:53.120]  answer for your request now on anything they've got water district officials all over from texas to
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:59.360]  tennessee to new york saying it's terrorism to demand your water be tested i'm not joking look
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:05.760]  look that up government is going wild government is rioting bureaucrats are rioting and let me
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:11.200]  tell you they want some good old-fashioned rioting so they can call out homeland security just like
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:16.880]  they did with the boston bombing three people killed a few dozen injured and they trained
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:21.520]  us for martial law nationwide now announcing on c span to start doing this anytime anything happens
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:25.200]  oh fireworks went off we're gonna lock your old neighborhood down and search all your houses
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:32.160]  without warrants totally illegal we're gonna do it oh oh fires in la awesome we're gonna okay
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:36.320]  we're gonna let it get out of hand and then call in troops and lock everything down just like new
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:41.360]  orleans we're fema jam the police communications so there'd be a stand down so looting would start
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:46.080]  so they could go in and do a gun confiscation drill i'm telling you it's order out of chaos
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:51.840]  order out of chaos this is what the government does just like big banks come in and bankrupt the
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:56.800]  country to then have it implode so they can buy everything up five years later for pennies on the
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.920]  dollar this is what they do this is just like big corporations come in and buy up at other
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:08.160]  corporations with pennies on the dollar or get control of the board and then run up giant debts
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:12.880]  steal everybody's pensions and then break up the company and sell it and nobody gets in trouble
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:18.240]  just like in goodfellas based on a true story the movie goodfellas with robert denero great movie
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:25.920]  is based on a true story that's a true story and they would go into a restaurant and say we're
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:31.120]  going to take your restaurant over or we're going to you'll give you problems and then they would
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:36.960]  run up the bills for a couple years paying under the bills handed all of the owner have them declare
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:43.920]  bankruptcy right and then burn the place down for the insurance and america and the rest of the world
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.480]  is being burned down for the insurance i mean do you understand that ladies and gentlemen
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:56.880]  and the globalists absolutely have beta tested the minority communities for the police state and
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:01.920]  do you think after they have speeches that are up on info wars dot com saying kill the police
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:06.720]  attack the police do you think the police are going to act better or worse after this do you
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:10.800]  think after all this happens you're going to have more businesses in your community or less
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:14.640]  so so then they say well let's go to the white areas so they go to the highways
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:19.920]  and start doing and again it's going to create nothing but division let's go to your phone calls

[01:15:53.760 --> 01:16:01.360]  card i go if you want to learn about what is real go to this card then my purpose also in calling
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:09.200]  is letting people know how they've been sci-oped since day one of the trevon martin how do i mean
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:17.120]  that since day one he has never zimmerman has never ever been the alleged killer he has always
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:23.440]  been the killer i've been following other murders whether it be a guy in south uh northwest of
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:30.080]  washington and oriental he was always a ledge killer the top the sheriff a ledge killer zimmerman
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:36.640]  was never and i listened to that's right as people say well he did shooting you know again
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:42.400]  that's different from self-defense to being the murderer on purpose he was always the murderer
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:46.000]  meaning he did it on purpose and again there was reasonable down he may have been a
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:50.320]  racist and gone out to kill him on purpose i don't think so but that could be the case
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:57.360]  doesn't matter there's reasonable down just like oj the alleged never the alleged the
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:01.600]  administration what president in history has ever taken sides in an ongoing court case
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:08.880]  i i can't remember one now that's what the lawyer said absolutely and and drudge has
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:14.960]  the article where it links through all the examples of how the media convicted zimmerman up front
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:22.160]  the media let's go to fox news let's go to fox news who i watch now and then because they're the
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:29.280]  other side not anymore because they've been showing ad nauseam the scowling picture of zimmerman
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:37.120]  and the skin leading 13 year old trayvon and then they showed the smiling black picture of the sheriff
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:43.920]  and scowling picture of the white hispanic the blacks are murderers are always shown smiling
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:50.240]  the white white hispanics whatever to me there's only one race there's a human race no i know but
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:55.680]  i mean now you could be you could be korean and they would say it was a white shooter
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:00.320]  i mean it just it's all about demonizing and i appreciate your call great points
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.840]  yeah and they're calling people protesters and a lot of them are protesters there's a lot of
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:10.800]  trendies a lot of whites out there as well and it's just a way to run around and all feel like
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:15.840]  victims and meanwhile we're all being victimized by the globalists with gmo the food all of it

[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:40.000]  but all of that is supposedly a okay because the real issue here is
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  is white people are racist and out to get you and and i was being sarcastic about monsanto
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:50.400]  say well let's just call them you know say they're racist and then i was like wait a minute
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:55.440]  they have a long history of dumping to oxen in minority areas springs poor troops with
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.720]  agent orange with feeding us the worst stuff in the world bill gates on their board they're
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:06.080]  eugenicists and i already know they're at the head of the eugenics operation so it's really
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:10.560]  true i mean i'm making my own point so many times i make an absurdist statement as a joke
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:13.520]  and then i go wait a minute that's actually what's going on
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:21.920]  let's go back to julio by the way i've met julio he's a reporter he's done some work for us before
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:26.880]  he's he's he's a black guy but he doesn't identify himself as that identifies himself as a human being
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.760]  getting away from the gmo stuff and i know you're focused on you're also a filmmaker
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:36.960]  what is your take julio on this whole sigh up or do you disagree with anything i've said
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:44.800]  well the truth is stranger than fiction alex and uh i interned at the number one station in
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:53.840]  chicago back in uh 2009 odin operated by abc and i i witnessed firsthand media manipulation how you
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:26:00.880]  can edit things to uh to let the public perceive a certain narrative that you are looking to push
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:05.360]  and it's done by the editors it's done by the news directors and yeah i had witnessed at first
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:10.720]  hand i produced news from college and just seeing this media hysteria going on you know if you're
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:14.560]  foreign or coming into the country and you're just watching corporate media for the last couple of
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:21.680]  weeks you would think that the biggest story in the entire united states of america is is in sanford
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:28.480]  florida with one case of a death of a 17 year and meanwhile us troops the headline today was
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:35.120]  the us is not invading egypt but us troops are massing in north israel south israel and by the
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:42.640]  gaza they are massing uh they won't leave uh they got there a month ago and or over a month ago and
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:48.400]  now won't leave they got there in early june won't leave jordan and jordan's an ally saying what's
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:55.040]  going on you've got israel with with cruise missiles attacking syria and it's not even news
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:27:02.800]  it's it's it's a racist cracker uh to use the term the media is using uh once that you know
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:09.200]  is g-hotting the black people there's so there's so many different psyops going on just in this
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:15.680]  entire case alone you have the psyop now of oh the justice system didn't work the legal system in
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:21.040]  the u.s is flawed because george zimmerman was acquitted when in reality the state of florida
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:27.440]  the prosecuted prosecution did an abysmal job presenting to this jurors that that's right
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:31.120]  i mean actually committed that's right even the miami herald one of the best papers in the country
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:36.560]  from a real liberal perspective owned by mclatchy had a big article with all these liberals going
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:43.440]  no they lost the case i mean anybody that knows law or is watch court tv a lot knows they didn't
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:49.840]  prove their case just like oj simpson i mean it is it is a no-brainer even though we think oj
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:56.080]  did it they did not prove it without a shadow of a doubt correction alexa i'm i'm half porto rican
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:02.720]  half venezuelan and and to see the media use white hispanic a made-up term that doesn't even really
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:08.400]  exist in the culture of of latinos themselves it's just another psyop in and of itself and again
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:13.200]  they're trying to pay for sure immigration and the black i mean you look like michael jordan to me
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:18.000]  so i mean i mean you've obviously got some african somewhere there oh probably my ancestors in
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:23.840]  venezuelan for sure yeah um it's it's just so fascinating alex this media psyop so much is
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:29.280]  going on i heard on msnbc today i flipped through the media i you know i monitor what's going on
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:34.720]  in corporate media and they have this guy torre he does the show the cycle he was talking about
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:40.400]  white supremacy in george zimmerman's secretive white supremacy and going after trayvon martin
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:44.720]  meanwhile his cousin's a cop and name and he they called him horre and most his family was
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:51.440]  uh i i guess what do you call it mestizo it's just so fascinating alex what's what's going on here
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:56.880]  well they're even trying to say this football player that reportedly shot the black guy
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:02.320]  over a fight with uh you know a girl or something that it's race now no it's not it's a much a thug
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:08.960]  nfl people i just i just can't believe it man i just it's just unbelievable look i think zimmerman
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:13.920]  was stupid following him down the street and i got to be honest if somebody walks with me with a
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:17.840]  gun and i wouldn't do anything wrong i'd be like hey man what's your problem but i don't think i'd
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:21.920]  climb on him and start beating him the issue is there's reasonable doubt julio good to hear from
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:28.320]  you do you agree that was reasonable doubt julio oh yeah there was reasonable doubt uh just the
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:32.880]  media's blowing things off a portion as usual you have gangs in chicago killing young children
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:37.360]  but that's not being talked about because then they'd have to expose the drug war that's right

[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:46.160]  across the state so he's going to be giving us his take and actually when i heard his take and he
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:51.280]  and he wanted to come on the show it was reminding me of how the police chief came out and said it
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:56.160]  was basically a setup and they wanted a conviction day one for political purposes and they had all
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:00.720]  the witnesses and were told to basically not talk about it and now the prosecutors have been caught
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:05.920]  with the head it guy going hey he's got guns he's got loot in these photos off his phone you don't
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:11.680]  want you know this to be given to the defense i mean mistrial right there we're going to talk to
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:15.520]  him in a moment like we're getting him on the line here in just a second but while we're waiting to
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:19.840]  do that let's go to a few more calls quickly i said i take a lot of calls and i haven't yet so
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:24.800]  i want to try to get some calls in right now pete in new york uh you're a real quick take on what's
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:29.200]  going on in the world hey what's going on alex thanks for taking my call man you bet buddy
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:34.720]  love your show uh yeah i just couldn't when you agree that this whole Zimmerman stuff is just like
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:39.200]  a divide and conquer distraction from really the important issues that's going on in the world
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:46.240]  right now i mean we have a military preparedness i mean iran's going i mean israel netanyahu's
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:50.720]  saying stuff about iran and their nuclear aspirations well here's the deal we've heard a
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:55.520]  lot about iran there's been a covert war there by the us nato and israel blowing stuff up
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:00.880]  but now they're moving troops in the russians are moving troops into the area and there's
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:06.720]  headlines like you know world war three in mainstream news so you're absolutely right sir
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:12.160]  that while we're busy fighting with each other over melanin in our skin but see i have to cover
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:18.240]  this because i'm not doing the magic trick i'm showing how the magic trick's done i'm trying
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:24.240]  to diffuse this by pointing out what's really happening the average you know uh libertarian
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:29.280]  right wing type talk show host even though i agree with them on most issues is busy talking about
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:34.000]  how racist a lot of black people are which is true and they're busy you know playing that up and
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:39.440]  it's actually causing a divide and playing you know racist sounding songs and things that you
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:44.240]  know really create division you know just because there's a lot of racist minorities
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:49.520]  doesn't mean it's okay to then play into the whole deal so that's why i'm forced to cover it but
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:54.160]  i'm glad you mentioned it's a diversion because i want to point out i'm not covering it as a
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:36:00.160]  diversion i'm covering it to show how it is a diversion do you get what i'm saying yes absolutely
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:03.920]  alex and i'm glad you are covering it i mean because there are issues that have to be addressed
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:08.240]  but i mean for people to say that this is supposed to be the top news story and we should all just
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:13.600]  lose our heads over something that in my city new york city it happens every day a spanish person
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:18.320]  kills a black person every day and you never hear it get reported i mean whether it's self-defense
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:22.640]  or not i mean there's bigger issues right now that we should all be focused on exactly but i mean
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:26.560]  one reason black folks are so angry is there is such a thing as driving while black walking while
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:32.320]  black i appreciate your call i mean i grew up as a sports guy playing baseball playing football
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:37.280]  wasn't great at really any of it uh but i had my moments but i was hit and miss plus i'm not that
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:43.040]  big of a guy but the point is so i was in sports so half my friends were probably black and i'd go
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:47.040]  hang out at their house uh and you know some of them live in the country some in the nice neighborhood
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:52.080]  some in the slums and so i saw a lot of stuff but you'd be driving you know with your black friend
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:57.200]  next to you you get pulled over you'd be walking to somebody's house with a black person you'd get
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:02.480]  it only happened when i was with a black person or if i was walking home at night at midnight
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:07.040]  and i was 13 years old and it was white kids the cops would then say you know well where do you
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:11.120]  going what are you doing because it is a little suspicious to be 13 walking around at midnight
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:19.360]  but i'd be walking around at noon on a saturday to you know go swimming or to go play baseball
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:23.600]  and the cops would pull us you know pull over and search us and stuff like that when i was a kid so
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:29.520]  i mean i get that's going on and it's like tony brown has said so many times tony brown's journal
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:35.120]  that what you see done in the black community that's going to be done in yours so i mean blacks
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:43.280]  have been given the short end of the stick but it's it's turned into this whole culture of freaking
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:50.560]  out and hyperventilating over this stuff now i'm going to go to david in missouri and john and
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:56.240]  earnest and and and and and ryan and steven others but i wanted to get that call in there

[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:10.000]  say who his name is but uh michael lebron what a cool name was his name as a the main prosecutor
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:16.320]  there uh one of the top prosecutors in Tampa florida so he knows florida state laws he knows
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:20.800]  the constitution he's been a prosecutor been a defense lawyer after that but he's also been
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:27.440]  a syndicated radio host on out of big stations like w o r number one in new york and w p i x
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:33.920]  channel 11 and uh he is part of their morning uh top newscast and their and their nightly top
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:39.440]  newscast that he's going to tape one uh for tonight right after the show ends Lionel media.com
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:46.720]  is his website and he joins us with his unique perspective is what i'd call not a liberal not
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:52.960]  a conservative i would call him a constitutional populist to give as a prosecutor his take and
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:58.880]  by the way when he when he gives you his take which is highly educated miami herald okay not
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:04.160]  known as some right wing group folks they talk to all their lawyers and they've got a bunch on their
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:10.720]  800 plus staff at the miami herald and they all concurred in an article yesterday that the prosecution
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:16.080]  blew the case Lionel uh i don't know your take on this yet fully but what is your take as a
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:23.200]  prosecutor on what's happening with this case very simple since april the 11th uh 2012 when
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:28.160]  george emerman was charged with secondary murder i said that he should never have been charged with
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:35.200]  that they overcharged the facts do not comport with this particular charge when you want to look
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:40.720]  at this i want you to think about it this way alex i've never heard more people alpine in way in
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:45.680]  regarding the law they would ever go on a sports show and say you know there's this
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:50.880]  game i'm supposed to be commenting on and i didn't see it i heard that the yankees did okay and i'm
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:55.680]  going to go on the radio and talk about it you they would never allow you to set foot in the
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:43:02.480]  studio but when it comes to the law and it comes to a trial i i promise you that 99% of the people
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:06.880]  who are both pined regarding this never listen to any of the facts of the case let me tell you what
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:13.120]  happened the jury was absolutely correct here's why the jury found either and jerry don't tell you
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:19.760]  why but they said either the state failed to prove beyond and to the exclusion of every reasonable
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:24.400]  doubt the case of secondary murder the intentional killing of another within difference with the
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:33.040]  brave mind ill will or manslaughter or this is the other part the state of florida failed to prove
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:39.600]  beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no self-defense one of two ways to happen now there's
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:45.920]  a third way to and nobody even addresses this at all because at first i must say this give me one
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:52.160]  second there is no winner here there's no victor nobody won the lottery nobody won anything a 17
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:57.680]  year old child your son my son's could be anybody this is somebody so it wasn't a spoil there wasn't
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:04.800]  a motive exactly but this child will never see age of 18 so nobody is gloating or nobody's high
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:10.480]  fiving sometimes during the course of argument over who's right and who's wrong regarding the
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:16.640]  interpretation of a case we forget that there's a human life involved that being said what happened
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:22.640]  was there was another aspect of this it seems very credible evidence based upon what the defense put
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:29.680]  on and based upon what the prosecution put on that draven martin was the aggressor now nobody
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:34.320]  wants to talk about this nobody wants to address this because it's almost sacrilegious to talk about
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:42.640]  a victim as being the aggressor but those those witnesses are cracker asses well john good john
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:50.160]  good saw this saw what happened he said this was trevon martin on top doing a a ground and pound
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:55.520]  for a sustained period of time if you look at the facts in this case and alex you ever see these um
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:45:00.640]  martial arts kind of graphics where they take just the shapes of blue or orange and they just show
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:04.880]  people fighting and i could show you what happened by computer graphics and you didn't know if they
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:09.520]  were black or white or male or female or anything but i just showed you this is what happened no
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:15.200]  joe rogan calls it the rape choke okay well basically get on top of somebody pound them choke
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:18.800]  them i mean look if somebody assaults me that's what i do i jump on top of them bang their head
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:23.280]  in the ground trevon martin definitely knew what he was doing but if you look at the facts of the
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:28.320]  case as induced at trial by the state of florida remember not just the defense but by the by their
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:33.600]  own witnesses if you could see an animation of this you would say that this person was the aggressor
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:39.280]  and this person defended himself unfortunately using deadly force that's what happened let me
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:44.560]  also just tell a couple of things here i'm a native floridian second generation in florida gets a lot
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:50.240]  of grief for everything from pangy chads to ken vote to these crazy gun laws and the like
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:57.920]  florida has had a very liberal carry permit since well for years however florida has one of the most
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:04.080]  aggressive alex the most aggressive minimum mandatory sentences including 10 20 life look
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:12.240]  that baby up chapter 775 10 20 life show a gun under an enumerated events show a gun 10 years
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:21.680]  fire a gun 20 years kill somebody like that plus a host of minimum mandatories for using a gun
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:27.760]  against a police officer florida does it the right way florida says we will allow you pursue
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:37.280]  into the second amendment to carry however woe unto you if you are in the wrong now if this jury
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:44.880]  had utilized its option to return a category one lesser included of manslaughter which they could
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:50.080]  have they sometimes think jurors think that while i'm being a compromise it's a compromise
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:55.600]  verdict that would have been life in prison exactly so what happens was that didn't happen
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:02.720]  this jury and another aspect of this talk about a misogynistic uh sexist view of this
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:07.520]  well those women you know how those women get alex you know how they are they they rule by
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:14.000]  their emotions this jury these women were most astute most surgical most precise in the analysis
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.960]  of well from what i know is what really killed it was the prosecution holding back evidence
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:27.520]  and the jury learned that they had photos of loot the gun all this on trevon's phone and held that
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:31.920]  back and a bunch of other stuff so he would have he would have defeated this on appeal if he would
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:35.920]  have been wrongly convicted don't you think well there's sanction hearings going on right now
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:40.880]  we don't know what they did because remember all the jury does is it just says not guilty we don't
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:46.320]  know why let me also tell you one of the things that's amazing in terms of the ineptitude of the
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:51.760]  state of florida in this case the prosecution first why would you put on the testimony of the
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:58.000]  walkthrough of george zimmerman this is his testimony in the light most favorable to him
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:07.280]  followed by george zimmerman on the shan hannity show and edited pro black but better word zimmerman
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:13.920]  presentation that's twice what happened alex was when the state arrested the defense did not have
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:19.040]  to put george zimmerman on the stand because the state already had but that brings in the conspiracy
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:23.920]  theories of how the police chief says that they basically said we're taking the case away we're
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:28.240]  going to charge him even though the police say they think it was in defense and the cops knew
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:32.480]  they wouldn't get a conviction anyways and then the police chief basically had to resign over to
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:39.520]  left out of conscience and then we discover that they then overcharge him and then do all these
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:46.400]  wrong things almost like they wanted to get him acquitted to then create a diversion for obama
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:52.320]  it was funny you say that it's funny you say that um gordon all said he's not a conspiracy theorist
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:57.680]  he's a conspiracy analyst and i'm not suggesting any conspiratorial aspect of this however i was
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:02.880]  talking to a colleague of mine i said if you found out after the fact let's just assume
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:09.600]  argumento hypothetically for the sake of argument but if you imagine found out that this was thrown
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:15.520]  then maybe i would understand why they put on the defense's testimony why they would call such
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:21.920]  luminary such as dr schiping bow who i still don't know what he testified to who was one who was
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:28.080]  recalcitrate when he said you can't see my notes putting on rachel jauntel to talk about i don't
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:34.560]  know what valerie wow all of these people one after another another the two hours i'm sure you've
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:41.040]  been around the courtroom but when you put your witness on you give a very limited microscopic
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:48.320]  direct examination why because the cross examination is based on the scope of your direct so when you
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:56.160]  give these long narrative stories in your direct you've just handed the keys over to the defense
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:02.160]  to have prosecution all of it to a cross examination all day long if i could let me address
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:08.240]  something also there is now the talk of people calling for civil rights prosecution federal
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:15.760]  civil rights now in the year 2012 last year the fbi interviewed over 35 individuals witnesses
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:21.360]  and the fbi it's not exactly gun shy about breaking charges they look at this case every
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:26.400]  which way you can imagine and they look to see whether there was anything any evidence that
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:33.520]  george emerman was acting based upon an animus or a dislike or a discrimination against lack of
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:40.080]  color or gender nothing they already did this so why are we looking at this again it's already been
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:46.320]  done absolutely and again even the miami herald talked to a bunch of liberal prosecutors and people
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:52.080]  and they said no way i mean zimmerman had to get off because they did a terrible job i think they
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:57.360]  dropped the ball on purpose for this giant political distraction we see right now that's
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:03.200]  what the just department took it over covertly what does freedom mean to you how about the freedom

[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:18.240]  channel 11 out of new york i mean i know a little bit about law i'm not a former prosecutor like
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:22.400]  you it's just that i've studied the law you know quite a bit just having to deal with it in business
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:27.760]  and life and reading the news every day and i just i mean right there the prosecution caught not
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:33.920]  giving vital evidence he walks right there i mean if charlie manson was caught with you know
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:38.960]  Sharon tate's dead baby in his hands it didn't matter if they tried to frame him he walks
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:46.720]  explain that i mean 10 10 10 guilty go free that one free man not go to jail p the media is saying
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:52.160]  the the the murder of black 17 year olds has been legalized that is not what's happened here oh no no
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:57.440]  in fact in fact that is more of a disservice there's a case brady against maryland and prosecutors
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:01.520]  and defense lawyers call them brady material that means that i as a prosecutor if i come across
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:06.240]  something that's exculpatory that gets you off the hook you may not know about it but i find a
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:13.360]  witness who who uh cast doubt upon your being at the scene i have to provide that to you if i do not
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:17.680]  tell me the prosecutorial misconduct it's a mistrial let me also tell you something which is
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:21.520]  interesting and i'm sure you come across this you know there's the truth and then there's the
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:27.520]  official story and um daniel patrick bornahan said you're entitled to your own opinion but not your
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:34.400]  own facts um what's interesting about this is there is a meme and you use this this dawkins
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:40.480]  notion of memetics this meme this this folklore this myth and somebody says it and it's repeated
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:48.080]  and it goes as follows why did char uh george zimmerman refuse the order refuse to follow the
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:55.280]  command of a 911 operator when they told him to go back in your car or stay in your car or not get
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:57:01.040]  in your car or something along those lines and not follow him why did he insist upon following
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:08.000]  and you will hear this and i have i think this is now my ten thousandth time when i will tell you
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:16.400]  that shawnafki who was not a 911 operator he was a non-emergency dispatcher who testified again you
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:22.960]  gotta watch the trial who said i never order anybody to do anything he kept asking george zimmerman
[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:29.200]  where's he walking is he walking here where's he going now let me expand on that briefly i also
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:34.480]  keep saying in the last year and a half racist quotes attributed to zimmerman and i go look for
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:40.400]  him and can't find him there's also just been made up stuff put out there it's bizarre i mean
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:45.680]  why not say he murdered murdered godzilla or something i mean it's just not true remember
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:51.360]  this classic witness nine as a as to be confused for or to be distinguished from client nine but
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:56.400]  let me go back there's one thing though they they kept if if you listen to the actual testimony
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:01.520]  and listen to the tape it's not nine one nobody ordered him but he was in essence being asked
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:07.600]  now understand something also this was a neighborhood watch volunteer why was he doing that at the
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:13.120]  behest of the sanford police department an officer dorival said not only was he great
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:17.120]  she tried to recruit him and alex this is the best thing they they call him a cop want to be
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:24.960]  be going after him and let's face it when i first heard this i fell victim do i thought here we go
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:31.040]  another robot hold on do do do five more minutes with us and we're going to get a lieutenant uh mike

[02:00:05.920 --> 02:00:16.080]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:21.520]  radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:32.720]  all right detective mike zulo is going to be in the studio whether she's here in austin texas
[02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:36.960]  he was here for abbott's announcement he's going to run against perry which is good abbott's a lot
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:41.200]  better than perry that's what perry's been sounding so libertarian lately is because
[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:47.760]  he's up against some competition uh old pony boots as they call him um uh but let's go back to
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:54.800]  linel who is a former prosecutor out of tampa florida in a syndicated tv slash radio host
[02:00:54.800 --> 02:01:00.640]  based out of new york uh in closing finished that point you were making but what do you make of
[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:08.000]  of the fact that the police are letting people block roads and beat up camera men and and push on
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:14.400]  people's cars and knockout windows i'm not looking for trouble but i just can't help it somebody
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:19.760]  blocks my car bows up to me i pray to god every day that i learn how to back down well i'm worried
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:24.160]  this is going to blow up like reginald denny if the media doesn't keep putting gasoline on it
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:29.840]  well alex i'm not familiar with some of those facts i will tell you though that if we use some of the
[02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:36.960]  rather strict law enforcement techniques of the tsa and use that rather sometimes draconian no
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:41.440]  nonsense approach perhaps we wouldn't have problems like this because you know people have to be
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:46.640]  allowed to to protest and that's fine there's also something very scary alex when yeah wait a minute
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:51.760]  i'm all for protesting i don't want the highway blocked and then people roughing up camera men
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:57.200]  that that's yeah violence is never warranted you know when you put out the word when you put out the
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:03.280]  word now we want you to become what you're doing in a weird way alex is you're you're tacitly providing
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:11.280]  the the message that there is a logical connection to violence perhaps and dissatisfaction with a
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:18.480]  verdict because what why would i suggest that you not do something which i'm i'm almost suggesting
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:22.800]  is a natural reaction but let me just clear up one thing which is no that's like when a cop says
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:28.160]  why are you getting upset when you're not to make you get upset or if i said alex whatever you do
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:32.480]  do not bang your head against the wall right now do not do that well why would i do well maybe it's
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:39.920]  maybe that's what yeah but here's the thing there are people who make up facts i'm telling you
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:44.480]  you know told story said that history would be a wonderful thing if only were true and in the
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:50.160]  case of the official accounts everything from the vietnam war to you name it people start to repeat
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:56.400]  memes and there is this thing this theme that is being repeated i heard somebody there was a
[02:02:57.120 --> 02:03:04.480]  candidate for new york mayor who said that an unarmed man was shot dead and i'm thinking well
[02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:11.120]  by its strictest definition perhaps yes but you're leaving out a lot of reasons behind that
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:17.440]  that the law of self-defense alex is natural it is not provided for by statute and this was not
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:24.560]  stand your ground it was not stand your ground i mean repeat it wasn't stand your ground this was
[02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:30.080]  common law natural law the ability to protect yourself because remember under the laws of florida
[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:37.040]  he had a carry permit it has to be concealed it's a it's a carry a concealed firearm permit
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:44.880]  you can't wear it exterior to you during the fight he testified that he saw draven going for this gun
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:52.640]  that's when it escalated had it not had that not happened again we can play what if had that not
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:58.400]  happened had george zimmerman not had physical damage to his head there could very well be
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:02.720]  a conviction for either secondary murder exactly or if he'd have shot him more than once because
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:07.520]  it would have shown the craveness of it i mean i mean or or shot him from a distance or had
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:13.520]  said something or if it took one witness just one witness john good for example to look outside and
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:20.480]  say brave on was was a miles away when he started shooting feverishly all of the if one person saw
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:26.240]  oj kill his wife if one person saw the decomposing body of casey antincrate what if what is spoken
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:34.080]  like a true cracker ass well here here is the bottom line also i'm just joking i'm sorry i'm from

[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:47.520]  he's also going to be interviewed for obama deception too and hopefully for the nightly news
[02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:53.920]  if he's got time to do all of that after the main radio show lieutenant mike zulo is a former
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:59.440]  law enforcement office criminal investigator for new jersey trained in fingerprint identification
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:05.680]  narcotics investigations homicide domestic violence etc he joined sheriff joe arpaio's maricopa county
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:11.920]  sheriff's cold case posse in 2005 when he moved to arizona lieutenant zulo has been commander
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:17.760]  of the cold case posse for the past seven years and a sheriff arpaio's lead investigator to reveal
[02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:23.520]  any and all evidence to determine if president obama's identification document is valid it was
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:28.560]  their goal to clear the document as authentic and move the country forward i've talked to people
[02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:34.320]  that were there like sheriff mac who was being asked first to do this and uh it was just so many
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:38.800]  constituents he said okay i'll do it guys i'm sure this isn't true because the people that were there
[02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:44.320]  at the meeting and then they're like no it's fake it's like oh no and that's why the justice
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:50.800]  department's come after them now you've seen all this and again we don't even know from my research
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:59.120]  who obama is three aliases proven record sealed the hanging out with a communist pornographer
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:04.320]  that looks just like him then his grandfather would bring him to uh in the summers i mean just
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:11.600]  his wife saying in all these speeches he's from kenya born there in the harvard review as the head
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:18.480]  lawyer uh i mean as the head of the harvard review saying that he was from kenya uh his book deal
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:23.200]  proposal saying was from kenya and then saying you're crazy if you say that i believe more and
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:28.400]  more now that it is dreams of my real father the film that shows who his real dad was that that was
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:35.920]  another cover so so from my view we don't know who he is we know he's lying we know there's a
[02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:40.160]  cover-up and you know you're a detective with a distinguished background you've been burrowed into
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:45.360]  this now for several years uh you were already there on the cold case you know dealing with
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:50.960]  serious crimes uh mike so you didn't even ask for this it was thrown in your lamp uh by sheriff
[02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:57.680]  arpaio so break down the saga what it's been like what's going on the certified people that you've
[02:10:57.680 --> 02:11:02.160]  had some of the top forensic experts in the country the criminal case that's coming up the supreme
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:07.920]  court of alabama from from as best you know what's going on here and what should the viewers know
[02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:11.280]  out there the listeners know because you know what msnbc's gonna do they'll probably play a clip
[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:17.520]  of this and go they're crazy uh and you know they're saying our dear leader is a fraud but
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:22.800]  but that's all they say they say we're crazy what's really going on well the sheriff arpaio did take
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:27.120]  this on and we really went in there with the intention that this thing isn't going to be anything
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:31.680]  let's go in let's clear the document move the country forward that was what the sheriff wanted
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:35.920]  and it was like 24 hours later i had to call the sheriff and say we're going to have a problem here
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:40.880]  we're 21 months into this now and i can tell you this we believe 100 that the document is
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:49.120]  a created 100 fabricated birth certificate it is not real as a matter of fact to use the word document
[02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:56.240]  is erroneous it is a pdf file it never started its life is a paper document it was built inside a
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:02.320]  computer other documents were scanned in and pieces of those documents were then utilized to create
[02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:07.360]  this fabrication it's the only birth certificate i'm aware of that has nine links and nine layers
[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:11.360]  the only document that i'm aware of that the registrar's stamp that gives its official
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:17.520]  authenticity has been imported into that document it comes in vertical it's rotated 90 degrees
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:22.240]  horizontal and placed on the document and you can move it all over the place that document is a
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:27.360]  forgery and if that document is a forgery what was offered to the american people is absolutely
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:32.640]  nothing alex what it really says is there is no proof on that birth narrative there's no proof that
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:37.600]  obama senior is the father and there's no proof this daily indonym is the mother there's no other
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:41.760]  information to back up those claims and it goes on and on that as you know the state department
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:47.680]  had the the fake dad who looks nothing like obama thrown out saying it's a sham marriage he's not the
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:52.880]  dad i mean that's mainstream news it just goes on i remember four years ago they're going he's
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:57.760]  wasn't named barry sataro that's a conspiracy now it's like oh yeah my name was barry sataro
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:03.120]  oh yeah i went to this mosque oh my name was he's got all these weird names bottom line i know you're
[02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:09.920]  a you know uh detective you deal with facts but why is it so fake what do you think's going on
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:14.800]  is it meant to be a diversion what is it you know i don't really think it's meant to be a diversion
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:18.960]  and i've heard that that argument what i think happened here i think somebody either made a
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:24.240]  mistake or in haste they put out the wrong file and when it hit the internet through the white house
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:29.760]  servers it was about 20 minutes 130 000 somewhat people had downloaded they didn't flatten it they
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:34.240]  didn't flatten it they didn't flatten it it was done in error now they have to live with this
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:37.440]  and if you notice the way they've been handling this is they don't say anything about it they let
[02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:43.200]  the little minions do it i think there's something very nefarious going on here um and i think i
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:47.120]  think part of the reason why you see no action on it which is you know you've been saying for a long
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:52.160]  time i think nsa is the reason why you see no action on this i think they've got dirt on people
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:56.160]  that they shouldn't have any that's not coming out yeah well you know you can control a lot of
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:14:00.800]  people with that kind of stuff this needs to go to congress that's what sheriff opio has been asking
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:05.360]  for and i'm in the process of trying to get it there and in your great state of texas we have
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:11.040]  texas congressman uh steve stockman who's expressed a lot of interest in this and i believe steve once
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:16.240]  i sit down or really dissect this topic with you i think he's gonna take some man he's a great guy
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:21.920]  i love it's so weird that it's like texas that's resisting everything and then now the democrats
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:27.760]  are in the news saying we're gonna take over texas here's the headline where they say that you know
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:32.080]  we're gonna turn it into a blue state and i'm not even a big republican i'm i'm more of a libertarian
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:40.480]  but uh it's really creepy to to see how they're intimidating the press they're intimidating
[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:46.160]  the media they're trying to intimidate our pio yes and even even liberals i know go oh yeah you know
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:50.560]  obama kind of is a thug and look at his attorney general and all the and now they're talking about
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:57.680]  arresting rupert murdoch and i'm i mean if they start arresting the heads of even mildly
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:03.920]  conservative media how this is like turning into nazi germany or soviet russia or something i mean
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:09.840]  it's reaching the threshold of ultra over the top creepy well i'll tell you that rupert murdoch um
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:14.080]  and i know you know jerry coursey very well when i was working closely with jerry on this in the
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:18.640]  beginning jerry received information of what was going to happen a rupert murdoch and i am watching
[02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:24.400]  it unfold so this stuff is in a mix these guys are planning things out they're taking actions that
[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:30.080]  have been designed months years ago yeah yeah i think it's a play exactly i mean i literally
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:35.360]  have no dirt on me i don't even speed anymore and we've got bureaucrats and harassment i don't get
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:38.480]  into on air coming out of the woodwork all of a sudden it's exactly what the head of world
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:44.000]  net daily said joseph ferrell last year because we i never got persecuted like this by bush and i
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:48.880]  was critical of him i mean people do not understand this is a criminal operation we're and i don't
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:52.640]  know you don't want to produce yourself probably agreeing with that it's just that i'm getting the
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:57.360]  point where uh well getting back to the birth certificate going over it going over this criminal
[02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:03.360]  complaint uh what's the greatest hits of this document that people should know about and and
[02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:07.280]  where this is going while you have a document that's comprised of nine layers and what it was
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:11.520]  really designed to do the intent of it is to deceive the intent of this document was to
[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:17.040]  fool the unsuspecting public to give you a document and i do believe it was a precursor to jury
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:20.960]  course his book where's the birth certificate i believe they were concerned that book was going
[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:27.200]  to come out and they launched this document but what this really says is we don't really care what
[02:16:27.200 --> 02:16:32.000]  we show you we're just going to show you something and we're going to expect you to believe it and
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:37.520]  if you look into his narrative that's everything you've been fed you see photographs you're told
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:42.240]  these are the players you see a photograph you're told this is where i was or this is who i was
[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:46.720]  sitting with and you're supposed you're you know expected to believe this but when you start looking
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:51.840]  at the some of those photographs those photographs themselves have been digitally altered so everything
[02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:57.200]  about this is a facade when you try to work the background of this individual the trail goes cold
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:17:02.160]  you can't find certain information certain information has either been now scrubbed or it's
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:08.000]  been locked away where you can't get to it the fate of this birth certificate coming out the way it
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:12.560]  did if they had flattened this document probably the only argument would have been the fonts and
[02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:16.640]  it would have gone nowhere because every document examiner tells you we can't tell you that unless
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:22.160]  we see an original our document examiner who happens to be a court certified 20 years in business
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:28.240]  actually worked for perkins coy as a certified document examiner this is the law firm that
[02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:33.520]  represents obama on every one of these issues wow going to be difficult for them to overcome that
[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:41.120]  and when he tells you it is a 100 fabrication you can take that to the bank it's a 100 fabrication
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:45.760]  so the implications to this are huge and the reason why i don't really think that this was some kind
[02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:52.080]  of joke is the penalties for this under us code on us statute they're up to 20 years in prison
[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:59.120]  the manufacture the display the passing on of this kind of document you're looking at some serious
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:05.200]  jail time now you go back into the way this document was released and they set up mr obama
[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:11.120]  with plausible deniability and it was done clearly in response to jerry coursey's uh book coming out
[02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:16.400]  the next week i mean i do believe that it was so obvious and and the media was all poised to
[02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:20.400]  attack and slander and say the book had been recalled when it wasn't you could see a clear
[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:27.040]  psyops you don't do that against something that that is a fraud you only act like that when you're
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:31.760]  scared to death exactly and i really do believe it was a preemptive strike trying to neutralize
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:37.520]  that book and as as jerry could attest to because we received the same information it was not 24
[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:44.000]  hours after the release of this birth certificate mainstream media fox news nobody would talk about
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:49.440]  this issue anymore and i have individuals and i cannot divulge who they are for fear of their
[02:18:49.440 --> 02:18:55.760]  sure losing their occupation in that in that genre that told me straight out we were threatened if we
[02:18:55.760 --> 02:18:59.760]  talk about this any longer we're going to be fired oh i talk to press all the time to get
[02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:04.000]  threatened they're told point blank you don't even criticize obama so you don't have a free
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:08.560]  press anymore we don't have a free press how do you vet a president this man has never been vetted
[02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:13.120]  this man has never gone through the ringer of being vetted you know and with sheriff opio it's
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:17.600]  kind of like a joke in his office i say you know sheriff he can't pass the uh the background check
[02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:21.520]  to be the janitor in your jail well that's what i want to talk about when we come back i've read a
[02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:26.640]  lot of history and i've read a lot of cold war stuff and the only time i've seen backgrounds with
[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:31.920]  people to use a fiction account it's like no way out with kevin costner the only time you've got
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:37.760]  backgrounds this shaded and different things is when it is a sleeper cell uh foreign infiltrator
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:41.840]  now now he could be a corporate infiltrator whatever he is but he i've never seen somebody
[02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:48.320]  that has a manchurian candidate cut out and you only see this with somebody that is an operatives
[02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:54.080]  of something and and and so i it's really scary because i didn't really get into the birth certificate
[02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:59.600]  thing and covered until i saw that fake and then i said oh my gosh this is all real mike zulo's our

[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:25.040]  you know investigate for sheriff opio all these stacks of murders and i'd love to get you on
[02:24:25.040 --> 02:24:28.800]  sometime for like two hours on the nightly news just talk about all the other cases you've been
[02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:33.200]  on is it so interesting about digging through cold cases and going after you know stuff that
[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:38.480]  other people given up on but you look at this we were talking during the break about about
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:44.080]  the fact of hey you better get life insurance vice versa and the type of stuff that goes on
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:49.440]  because people don't know how real this is until you get the harassment but i was saying during
[02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:53.120]  the break i think we see the takeover happening you're like yeah i know it's it's happening right
[02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:57.760]  now with the persecution of press and the not caring i mean where do you think this country's
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:03.520]  going i'm i'm afraid i'm afraid to think about that i i think we are at a critical point and i
[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:08.480]  think you are seeing and i think you've said it before people are starting to wake up but they've
[02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:13.520]  got it they got to pick up the pace and we have some really bad problems and you have situations
[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:18.640]  here where you could almost look at it as the police are becoming an extension of this there
[02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:25.200]  are rights being violated all over the place constitution is meaning nothing you know the the
[02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:30.320]  whole incident down in florida right now you know man is demonized for carrying around in the chamber
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:34.560]  of a nine millimeter that's no different than a guy having a five-shot revolver there's there's
[02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:38.960]  rounds in the chamber exactly but this is what they do they take it and they start with these
[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:43.680]  themes and they keep perpetuating these as if they're truths and they're not they're fables
[02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:47.760]  so we're in a really difficult place and i and i think the battle is really for the mind
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:52.240]  because if they can convince you of things they could give you uh scenarios where you have to
[02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:55.680]  give up your rights and slowly give up your rights we all know what the founding father said about
[02:25:55.680 --> 02:26:00.560]  that and they just announced now the cia is going to domestically engage in propaganda covertly that's
[02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:04.160]  what i heard i mean they're just putting it all out now it's like yeah we'll arrest you and disappear
[02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:08.480]  here yeah we'll kill you what do you think about michael hastings car blowing up he says i'm going
[02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:12.240]  on the run i've got something that's going to bring him down the fbi is visiting and it turned
[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:16.640]  out i've talked to the family off record so they all got visited and the fb we didn't visit anybody
[02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:21.200]  and then the car blows up the engine goes the opposite direction well you know i haven't had
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:25.760]  any information on that except what i've been told and what i'm told is it looks like the
[02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:30.560]  automobile came and rested upon that tree yes there wasn't no real front end damage so that
[02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:36.080]  makes it very difficult for me to think how a complete engine goes 350 feet the other way
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:40.480]  i mean something happened there um especially that he was making those kinds of telephone calls
[02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:44.800]  my bigger concern is you know like bright part bright part he had something other than what we've
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:48.720]  been shown oh he said it's going to bring him down and the biggest thing ever and that's never
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:54.320]  surfaced so well isn't it a telltale when he's been dead 45 minutes and somebody in the hospital
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:27:00.160]  says no foul play and then the coroner dies of arsenic poisoning the guy that was did his body
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:04.160]  i know they're they're just they're things that it's very difficult from our business we work
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:09.520]  in facts and evidence and proof so for for us to speculate is dangerous but i will tell you
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:15.360]  that's strange well when it starts piling up it does um it does and when it starts piling up like
[02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:20.000]  that you know all of a sudden you know when something's a coincidence you get a onesie or a twosie
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:24.080]  not three four five six seven eight nine ten those aren't coincidence anymore somebody is doing
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:28.160]  something on purpose something is happening here something's been exactly if you had one
[02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:32.880]  hit and run out in the country of say an old lady okay hitting around but if you had five
[02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:37.680]  well we've got a serial killer exactly i mean it's it's it's it's obvious it's obvious it becomes
[02:27:37.680 --> 02:27:42.640]  obvious and there are things that happen in these situations where you could almost mirror them
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:46.880]  in other ones you know there's always the precursors who says what who says he's
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:51.200]  going to do this and all of a sudden he disappears you know so you you have to be mindful of that
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:56.160]  but you know this is real this is not a fake game that's being played here and that birth certificate
[02:27:56.160 --> 02:28:02.160]  that is nothing more than an error they released that an error and i think the american people
[02:28:02.160 --> 02:28:08.720]  have the right to know who their president is and where he was born uh one of our reporters uh gg
[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:12.960]  r net went out to la and actually went to the tree it's barely damaged we just showed some
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:18.480]  footage of it and then uh nomi prens who lives out there also a journalist she said she went
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:22.880]  looked at it the day after and it was barely even scratched and that's what the photo showed
[02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:28.240]  is it came to rest the witnesses all said it blew up in the middle of the road so if my car blows
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:33.360]  up like that i want an investigation i would think so and what's great about that you know i
[02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:37.440]  witnessed testimony you know you could have five people witness the same accident and they always
[02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:42.880]  see something different they're never 100 percent in sync with each other but the main event usually
[02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:46.960]  is and when you've got witnesses more than one telling you this thing blew up before it hit the
[02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:50.720]  tree you could take it to the bank it blew up before it hit the tree i mean it's crowded as a
[02:28:50.720 --> 02:28:55.840]  jackknife with an 181 that's different but basically went up in the air and then flew over up against
[02:28:55.840 --> 02:29:00.320]  the tree and the engine shot the other direction i'd have to have a demolitions expert on but
[02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:04.400]  that's almost sounds like a bomb on top the engine because it would blow down blowing the
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:08.880]  engine out towards the back and then the car i mean that's all kinetic i guess you'd have to
[02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:12.800]  talk to a physicist yeah i'm not the guy that does that you know our explosive experts may
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:16.000]  have a different opinion but sure but if you hit a tree the engine doesn't blow out the back it
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:20.720]  doesn't blow out the back no and you have to hit it with some force to move it that far too and
[02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:26.240]  you would have such front end damage on that vehicle such damage to that tree i mean the tree is
[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:31.120]  is a tree but it's wood it's gonna it it's gonna be damaged especially with that kind of impact
[02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:36.320]  and if there is like they say nothing there that's a problem that's a problem unbelievable let's come
[02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:41.760]  back and get more into this fraudulent birth certificate that you get out of a crackerjack box
[02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:46.640]  and and how we turn this country around with mike we'll be right back stay with us we'll also give

[02:33:18.640 --> 02:33:31.040]  all right i'm going to take some calls they're all over the map david nick ryan urness john
[02:33:31.040 --> 02:33:39.040]  everybody after mike zullo and myself sit here and have some time and talk about other issues mcso.org
[02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:48.240]  and that redirects to mcsoccp.org and that is the criminal enforcement special services cold case
[02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:54.720]  posse out of arizona and there's a lot of important things on that site and it's also supported
[02:33:54.720 --> 02:34:00.000]  outside of the sheriff's department funding mechanism so tell us a little bit about the cold
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:04.800]  case posse and how people can support it the cold case posse is a separate organization if you will
[02:34:04.800 --> 02:34:11.840]  it's a 5013c our mission is to voluntarily help the sheriff's office and we are in service to
[02:34:11.840 --> 02:34:18.960]  the sheriff himself everything that we do especially in this investigation cannot be supplemented
[02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:24.160]  financially by the maricopa county sheriff's office that's what actually enabled this investigation
[02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:28.240]  to happen because if sheriff opio had to use taxpayer dollars they would have been on him
[02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:33.040]  in a minute to shut it down so everything that we do every ship that i take every place that i go
[02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:37.440]  we have to pay for it is pay for it out of donated funds so you know any donation five
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:42.400]  dollars ten dollars absolutely and tell us about this criminal complaint what's going on with
[02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:49.520]  this case in alabama alabama was actually a uh an elections case that was done way before we got
[02:34:49.520 --> 02:34:54.240]  involved with the alabama thing what happened over there is i guess uh judge more the ten
[02:34:54.240 --> 02:35:00.240]  commandment judge has got this now in the supreme court and the democratic alabama democratic party
[02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:07.040]  put in what's called an amicus brief a friend of the court brief and they attempted to put forth
[02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:11.840]  accusations against the evidence that was introduced by attorney larry claiming
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:15.600]  in this case regarding the birth certificate so mr claiming it called me up and he asked me if i
[02:35:15.600 --> 02:35:21.520]  would do him a favor and put together a rebuttal document and affidavit about the investigation
[02:35:21.520 --> 02:35:25.600]  what i could tell him at this point and that's what i did i believe that's about 30 pages
[02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:31.840]  100 some odd points of interest are in there and i think it would behoove everyone who's
[02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:36.960]  watching this that has an interest in this read this this is a sworn affidavit that i submitted
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:42.320]  to a superior court that means i could be held liable for projury if there's anything in here
[02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:46.000]  and then what's this criminal complaint i'm hearing about well the criminal complaint we're trying
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:52.320]  to put together a criminal case trying to bring about a criminal complaint the problem with this is
[02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:57.120]  you know this has only come to us 21 months ago and to everybody seems like an eternity
[02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:02.160]  but when you're trying to put together information like this to bring forth these kind of charges
[02:36:02.880 --> 02:36:07.040]  you have normally the assistance of other law enforcement authorities especially federal
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:12.400]  authorities we don't have that in this we can't call up the fbi and ask them for help now you're
[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:16.560]  having to go through hell just to get each little piece every piece that and everything takes time
[02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:21.520]  and everything takes money money and time and what i have to do is you know even like i think i
[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:25.680]  told you earlier you were the first video i ever saw of of anything with this and you guys were
[02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:32.480]  taking apart the document well every step that you did i have to times three go get that analyzed
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:37.440]  to make sure it's correct and then we could put that in to our report and use this information
[02:36:37.440 --> 02:36:41.680]  well that was just our quick analysis of it dealing with videos dealing with photoshop
[02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:46.400]  dealing with documents we have some folks that have worked in in in documents and we just knew
[02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:50.880]  when they said oh it's always in layers it's not in layers unless it was originally in layers
[02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:56.080]  meaning it's a made-up document it'd be one layer it'd be the image of the document and
[02:36:56.080 --> 02:37:00.880]  then we saw the fonts and all of it and just said this looks really suspicious were we accurate
[02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:05.520]  yeah you were accurate very accurate um especially the you know the layering thing
[02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:09.760]  you're going to have people try to put forth theories that the layering could be done
[02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:15.760]  because of automated processes and software well we have extensively extensively researched out
[02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:21.760]  we put this document through 1200 computerized tests trying to get a replication of the obama
[02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:26.800]  document and you can't do it so they dropped the ball massively and we do that all the time when
[02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:31.440]  we're doing an article and we think it's right but we publish it and then it doesn't all go up or
[02:37:31.440 --> 02:37:36.000]  there's a problem or all of it you know and and we're not doing fraud it's just a bunch of articles
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:40.800]  and documents it'll get scrambled and then one time we had a bunch of traffic to the site we
[02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:47.040]  couldn't get it down to put up the right one for like two hours and people thought we put out a messed
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:53.840]  up document on purpose but but again with this they just jumped the gun or what happened well
[02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:59.040]  I you know I can't tell you what exactly happened there what we know is this that that document
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:05.520]  sat in a mac computer 20 minutes before it was uploaded to the white house website server in a
[02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:11.840]  program called preview and that's of a particular interest to us because it has timestamps yes
[02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:18.000]  but preview has a capability of erasing what's called metadata from other programs so the other
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:24.080]  programs that were used to create that document they suspected or thought that it was going to erase
[02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:31.120]  all that information and all your left would be is preview and the pdf file itself our forensic
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:37.280]  experts were actually able to go in and find remnants of metadata that then told us what other
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:43.120]  programs were in fact used and for folks that don't know it's just like photos on a card to get wiped
[02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:47.920]  you can put them into a program that actually resurrects them resurrects it and so we we know
[02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:52.560]  how the document was put together we know what processes were done to put that's in this document
[02:38:52.560 --> 02:38:57.920]  breakdown for for folks that aren't experts in this basically what was done basically the document
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:02.320]  the document started itself like i said as a computer file what they did is they took other
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:07.920]  source documents now you have to realize they took other birth certificates real ones scan them into
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:15.200]  a computer and then systematically took information from different documents to create the pdf image
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:20.560]  that everybody saw released when the president released it they painstakingly lifted date stamps
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:27.680]  they painstakingly lifted words and letters on words in a cut and face pattern cut and paste fashion
[02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:34.160]  to lay this upon layer to give you an impression of a complete document when it was done even going
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:39.520]  as far as replicating the green safety paper computerized so they make it look to you as if
[02:39:39.520 --> 02:39:45.120]  this is real but it's not and when you take apart those layers you could actually take those layers
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:50.240]  turn them on and off and you can see exactly what was moved why did no bomb or his people just go to
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:56.480]  the cia that are experts in making documents fake that you can't even tell i'm thinking that uh this
[02:39:56.480 --> 02:40:05.520]  was done uh on a lower level than that let me say this i am concerned that the person that may have
[02:40:05.520 --> 02:40:10.000]  put this document together for them may have been and for lack of a better word i mean no
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:15.280]  disrespect to nobody where if something were to happen to that sure sure you want to keep
[02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:19.280]  us close to your vest because this is this is blackmailable if you have an agency do it that's
[02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:23.760]  why they always create corporations private groups outside of it so they can even keep that
[02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:28.080]  secret from the government yeah and you make uh something happen to that one individual that put
[02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:31.520]  it together nobody's going to pay any attention to it so we should be looking and i know that's
[02:40:31.520 --> 02:40:34.960]  what dr corsey's been doing it people in and around the white house that might have been
[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:38.640]  falling down hitting their heads looking for it look at everybody i i read the paper every day
[02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:42.400]  looking to see if something happened to somebody we have some people of interest and we're keeping
[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:49.040]  tabs on them um but uh this is i think something that started out very small but has grown now
[02:40:49.040 --> 02:40:53.280]  sure how dumb would you have to be if they come to you and go hey you're good at photoshopping
[02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:59.040]  i've done some documents cut this up for us i mean you've got to know with a mafia like this
[02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:02.560]  if there's ever a problem you're going to be sleeping with the fishes well people do things
[02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:06.240]  and don't realize it you know first of all if you got a big chunk of money or it's to help
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:10.320]  you know the man that you wanted to put in that white house you know people do things for the
[02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:15.040]  sake of just doing them it's very strange to me um you know a lot of times people don't look at the
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:18.640]  other side well it's peer pressure peer pressure not knowing yet there's always another side to
[02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:24.880]  the coin you know if somebody's asking you to help them do something that may not be 100 legitimate
[02:41:24.880 --> 02:41:29.600]  you know you got to ask yourself why shifting gears and the kind of stuff we have to deal with
[02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:34.320]  because i guess you use the communist term but from a libertarian perspective fellow travelers
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:38.640]  you deal with a lot of we're telling me stuff with the phone and harassment and things everybody does
[02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:43.520]  is uh you know trying to expose what's happening but you i think you made the point that you can
[02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:50.240]  clearly see they're going for it all i mean there's the feeling of wow nobody's stomping them everybody's
[02:41:50.240 --> 02:41:55.680]  scared intimidated they're going to go all the way can you elaborate on just from your research
[02:41:55.680 --> 02:42:00.480]  and being in and around government and a detective from new jersey talking to other colleagues in
[02:42:00.480 --> 02:42:06.480]  law enforcement and people are people as creeped out as i am or as creeped out as you are i don't
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:12.320]  think they are i mean people that have started to pay attention to this yes i think the scandals
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:17.840]  with the irs that's gotten people's attention i don't even think they realize the severity of that
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:22.160]  but when you have an incident like vengazi and you can't get a special committee together
[02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:26.880]  to investigate that there's a big problem that's blackmail yeah and people that are in law enforcement
[02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:31.200]  realize that that's a big problem fast and furious there are still people being shot
[02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:35.200]  with those weapons and when you have a police chief last week yes and when you have an email
[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:39.680]  that says we're going to use this to attack the second amendment um i think there's some
[02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:45.120]  statutes in us code to talk about that yeah that's false flag that's a uh that's a frame up
[02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:49.440]  i mean that's premeditated racketeering i don't and and it's here and it's here and it's being
[02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:53.920]  done and and you know it's almost hiding in plain sight if you will exactly i've studied history
[02:42:53.920 --> 02:42:59.200]  and that's the point when a hitler when a Stalin when a male can get away with anything it always
[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:04.880]  just it's a criminal culture where all their minions now can't get in trouble i mean it these
[02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:10.560]  guys are like invincible if we don't take them down how do we i mean how do we stop them you
[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:15.680]  know i i i would i don't know if i have the answer to that question i know that the upcoming
[02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:21.280]  elections are going to be very important um and i think that people are going to have to pay mine
[02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:25.680]  to you don't want lip service anymore you want to know what that candidate's going to do when you
[02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:29.280]  put them in there because you don't need any more of this you need people that are going to have the
[02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:34.560]  backbone to want to get to the bottom line and the answers to these things that have been happening
[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:39.760]  and are willing to take the steps to prevent it from happening in the future and i think
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:44.480]  you know our biggest problem right now alex our voices are silenced our voices are silenced if
[02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:48.800]  it wasn't for steve stott steve stockman i don't know where we would go with this i mean that's
[02:43:48.800 --> 02:43:53.120]  one man standing up he is going to need your support if he does what i believe he's going to do yeah
[02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:57.200]  do people get what we're going through i'm not asking for people to go oh you're a hero i'm
[02:43:57.200 --> 02:44:01.120]  asking for him to support us because i have a compulsion to stand up against police my whole
[02:44:01.120 --> 02:44:05.920]  life not i'm not even some good guy i just instinctively get angry about it and everybody
[02:44:05.920 --> 02:44:11.200]  thinks oh we'll just go along it'll be okay no then the dam breaks the corrupt take over everything
[02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:18.960]  the society collapses we've got to have people stand up and exactly support people when they
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:24.800]  go and do the right thing you have to and right now i think you're seeing uh you know when you see
[02:44:24.800 --> 02:44:30.080]  the republicans turn on the younger republicans are calling them wing nuts or whatever they've
[02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:35.200]  been calling them lately you know carl rove yeah yeah they're scared of the real tea party people
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:39.760]  yes so they've all got them surveilled they know steve stockman's good they know ram paul's good
[02:44:39.760 --> 02:44:45.760]  they know that uh cruise is good ted cruise they know that's why they've got the republicans and
[02:44:45.760 --> 02:44:50.800]  democrats circling the wagons they've had internal tapes as you know a month ago come out of biden
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:55.680]  to millionaire donors going we got to do something about these real tea party people we got to go
[02:44:55.680 --> 02:45:00.320]  after them because there's the answer right there's the answer and you know what it is it's people
[02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:04.000]  that are based in the constitution you know that's the thing that's dying in this country more than
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:08.640]  anything else it's our constitution you go back and i remember growing up in new jersey that's
[02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:13.840]  basically a democratic state and we grew up fine you know why because we may have differences
[02:45:13.840 --> 02:45:18.000]  from republican to democrat but we had the constitution and that was the thing that held
[02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:22.960]  us together they are eroding that people don't even understand it anymore they don't even know
[02:45:22.960 --> 02:45:26.960]  it's in it well they're about they're abolishing it they are i mean they've got a wrecking bolt
[02:45:26.960 --> 02:45:31.440]  they've already torn like half of it out and now the second half's going to go faster than the first
[02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:38.080]  half that's that's the concern and i think you can see that this is escalating um you know you have
[02:45:38.080 --> 02:45:42.560]  the justice department now jumping into whatever happened down there in florida all of a sudden
[02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:49.200]  we have a civil rights violation you know ten years ago that would just be what it is a man
[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:53.760]  defending his life he was afraid for his life now we have a civil rights violation i don't
[02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:59.040]  understand the thinking anymore it's if we don't get what we want in one court we'll just find
[02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:02.800]  another court we'll bring you through another court we'll just do whatever we want to do
[02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:07.040]  until we railroad you and to me that looks like that's what's going to happen down there again
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:13.680]  you know you have to start to worry about that you know it's pretty clear when you have for
[02:46:13.680 --> 02:46:18.560]  lack of a better word a lynching and to me that's that's what is going on speaking of that i want
[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:27.120]  to get us some callers on this subject but people need to go to mcsoccp.org that's the criminal
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:34.480]  enforcement special services cold case posse in fact there's a shorter website it's mcsso.org
[02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:41.360]  mcsso.org and donate today and lieutenant mike zulo is here with us today and again
[02:46:42.720 --> 02:46:47.440]  ladies and gentlemen they're going to destroy everything and i've been real critical the
[02:46:47.440 --> 02:46:53.360]  republicans because they're a mafia too especially the old guard but i'm telling you this 2014
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:58.480]  election coming up i'm going to say this now the democratic mafia is going to take completely over
[02:46:58.480 --> 02:47:03.360]  they're going for it all right now you've got to vote republican and i've i've just got to that point
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:08.640]  realizing that you've got to vote for tea party people real tea party people the mainline republicans
[02:47:08.640 --> 02:47:12.480]  have tried to take it over they haven't been able to down trying to destroy it you got to go after
[02:47:12.480 --> 02:47:16.560]  the republicans that are working with the democrats and you've got to vote for real tea party
[02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:22.640]  republicans you've got to run yourself we've got to block because if they end up getting the house
[02:47:22.640 --> 02:47:26.560]  and they've got the trifecta it's over i mean i'm telling you they're going to bring in they've
[02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:32.640]  already billed him as the new lincoln who's going to wage war and basically demonize anybody that's
[02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:38.080]  a constitutionalist as like some type of confederate that's the branding i already see well you know
[02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:42.320]  i and and here's something that was just alarming to me i've had the opportunity now to visit several
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:48.880]  congress people in washington and i've heard this more than once republicans say they have no voice
[02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:56.240]  they have no microphone in congress now if they're telling me that if they don't have a voice
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:48:00.880]  you don't have a voice well that's it i mean if the republicans were running everything and doing
[02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:05.200]  this i would say vote democrat or i'd vote for something else it's a separation of powers it's
[02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:11.120]  so we've got i think that's why they're so arrogant is that they just have gotten away with anything
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:14.640]  what do you call that in criminology where they get emboldened or what was the you know i don't
[02:48:14.640 --> 02:48:18.080]  remember the term i know exactly what you're talking about though i don't remember the term
[02:48:18.080 --> 02:48:22.640]  but they get so brazen about it because they feel like they're untouchable they act untouchable
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:28.560]  untouchable they get to a place where they can just do anything and know that you'll sit down
[02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:32.000]  like a lapdog and take it and i think what you said with the police because so many police are
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:36.000]  still the bedrock of this country but then other departments are going crazy it's that rolling
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:40.000]  downhill that arrogance so that you know they're trying to recruit people that'll do whatever
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:45.120]  they're told yes yes they are and you know you have bigger problems with this too is
[02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:50.960]  they start to desensitize you in areas that normally you would be affected by you would react to
[02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:58.560]  and they do it by well i think you have a video coming out it is psyops it is ways of keep
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:02.720]  perpetually gaslighting you if you will keep changing your altered so you don't know what's
[02:49:02.720 --> 02:49:06.880]  going on you don't know what's going on i study this 18 hours a day i'm obsessed with it my wife's
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:10.800]  like do you ever stop you know because i can't get out of it because i realize it's a death struggle
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:15.920]  against tyranny this is this is real my life's on the line this this is real tyranny in america
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:20.720]  there's no debating it right and and now it's it's like i'm even more upset because it's all
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:25.360]  everything i've been validated and you've been by all the stuff coming out and people like aren't
[02:49:25.360 --> 02:49:30.000]  you feeling good i'm like no i'm not feeling good now they're not even in trouble when it's all
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:34.480]  admitted right right and you know you look at something as and i don't want to minimize it
[02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:40.880]  but you look at something as simple as this verse or divicate and i can count on one hand
[02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:46.480]  the amount of new stations that have said they even question this versus the amount of times
[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:51.760]  you're told you wear a tinfoil hat this can never happen you know they do these psyops
[02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:57.120]  they plant them in the public's mind and it's easier to believe the lie alex than it is to
[02:49:57.120 --> 02:50:00.800]  believe the truth for folks that don't know what gaslighting is it's a famous film but it's based
[02:50:00.800 --> 02:50:05.360]  on real things that happen it's like stockham syndrome there's been famous cases where a pimp
[02:50:05.360 --> 02:50:09.600]  or will abuse and punch a woman in the nose and she's bleeding he goes i didn't punch you you're
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:14.720]  crazy and someone that feels powerless their mind will trick them and they'll go i did that to myself
[02:50:15.680 --> 02:50:20.400]  now now people aren't weak minded we go how does that work it's like it's like hypnotism
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:25.040]  works on the weak minded america's hypnotized i mean that's really it yeah how do you get
[02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:30.640]  them out of that he's desensitized yeah well they made a fatal mistake with the irs thing i think
[02:50:30.640 --> 02:50:34.880]  that wakes up a lot of people because that is something that people feel and they're all
[02:50:34.880 --> 02:50:40.800]  afraid of the irs so that that kind of woke them up a little bit and imagine going to people
[02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:45.840]  and saying what do you pray at your church where the irs don't don't i can't believe that we're
[02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:48.720]  going to come right back with your phone calls a little bit of overdrive and then he's going to

[02:54:25.440 --> 02:54:32.720]  that are on the board on a host of subjects but you really need to go to mcs o.org and donate
[02:54:32.720 --> 02:54:37.200]  today that's not wise here that was he didn't even ask me to promote that or talk about trying to
[02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:41.760]  fund sheriff arpaio's separate group that he heads up not just investigating the birth certificate
[02:54:41.760 --> 02:54:49.120]  but a lot of other murder cases you name it uh mike zulo is our guest mcs o.org but we were
[02:54:49.120 --> 02:54:56.240]  talking about you know mysterious deaths of breitbart and people like that and uh hastings
[02:54:56.240 --> 02:55:01.120]  and it's how the media is like you shouldn't look at that it's a conspiracy theory to even look at it
[02:55:01.120 --> 02:55:07.920]  that just shows how they'll turn the other way if a bunch of people start getting killed i know
[02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:16.080]  and uh that's what you said off area look without the media without a real outlet for people to hear
[02:55:16.080 --> 02:55:24.080]  and get truthful reporting they are then ignorant of facts they are ignorant of pertinent stories
[02:55:24.720 --> 02:55:30.400]  and how could you expect someone who's ignorant of anything to number one take an action come to
[02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:35.680]  their own conclusion or know the difference between truth and deception ignorance is a killer
[02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:44.000]  and until we figure out a way to change that we are going to have a major major problem in this
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:51.360]  country coming to any conclusion as a as a united body i don't want to have confrontations with the
[02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:54.960]  system because i get the average person and it's just brainwash like the general public
[02:55:54.960 --> 02:55:59.040]  but when the government's training and buying billions of bullets and seven thousand armored
[02:55:59.040 --> 02:56:04.400]  vehicles and all the rest of this but you see the public buying a hundred million guns since
[02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:08.800]  obama got in and we know of and everybody says i don't trust it people instinctively know this is
[02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:14.800]  a tyranny i mean is that i guess that's the last check is that and i guess if it gets too bad i
[02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:19.520]  i hate to think what's going to happen well you know sheriff opio has a tank sheriff opio has
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:24.640]  a 50 caliber machine gun but he's elected locally but he's never going to use that stuff against
[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:30.480]  his own people and that's the difference here you you have to tell me what is that he needs it down
[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:36.000]  there and then in that area he does need it down there what is dhs going to do with that kind of
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:40.480]  equipment i who are they going to fend off we have a military to protect the borders
[02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:44.720]  who are they going to use that against why are they acquiring that well they admit it's for the
[02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:50.640]  tea party their own manuals all say returning veterans gun owners libertarians in the fetters
[02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:55.600]  anybody who's really an american i mean let's face it we're nothing special we're just americans i mean
[02:56:57.920 --> 02:57:03.440]  you know i i say this to a lot of people now what is the privilege that you have being a united
[02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:08.960]  states citizen being a natural born united states citizen what are the privileges because you can't
[02:57:08.960 --> 02:57:13.520]  tell me that we have any because you can just come over a border and get them here you don't have to
[02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:19.440]  be a citizen to get these privileges you get almost more rides when you're not a citizen i and so i
[02:57:19.440 --> 02:57:24.480]  know when my grandparents came here they came here went through the naturalization process
[02:57:24.480 --> 02:57:30.400]  and became united states citizens and because it meant something you gained something you gained
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:34.880]  those constitutional protections those are given to people now regardless how they come over
[02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:39.360]  sheriff opio when he does those immigration sweeps and and things that they they criticize him about
[02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:42.640]  let me tell you something i've worked with those deputies human smuggling deputies
[02:57:42.640 --> 02:57:48.880]  i watch those deputies put their lives on the line taking down coyotes bringing over human traffic
[02:57:49.520 --> 02:57:55.440]  from mexico defending and protecting people from that's right most police just roll over now and
[02:57:55.440 --> 02:58:01.600]  take the money i mean look look at what they've done in mexico to the system i mean do we really
[02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:06.720]  want mexico to collapse into us this is madness well you know the whole the whole premise i think
[02:58:06.720 --> 02:58:10.800]  is it's just one big open border i think that's what everybody wants and they're giving us the
[02:58:10.800 --> 02:58:15.840]  ruse look at the signs up to 70 miles into arizona saying don't go into this area controlled by
[02:58:15.840 --> 02:58:21.360]  mexican i stood right next to those and you look at that's the feds planning a flag saying drug cartel
[02:58:21.360 --> 02:58:26.720]  stuck this over yeah and they're facing inland from the border they're facing to america telling you
[02:58:26.720 --> 02:58:31.040]  don't go in here it's in united states problem and the next it'll be a hundred miles yeah and then

[03:00:33.120 --> 03:00:36.720]  you just made a powerful statement during that break but please say that again well we were talking
[03:00:36.720 --> 03:00:41.280]  and i and i you know i i want to leave the impression look not not everything is lost alex
[03:00:41.280 --> 03:00:45.680]  you know america right now is in deep but i believe in the end america is going to prevail
[03:00:45.680 --> 03:00:51.120]  and i believe that the majority of americans are god-fearing constitution loving people
[03:00:51.680 --> 03:00:57.760]  and i think to our benefit we are slow to pick up arms and i hope it never comes to
[03:00:57.760 --> 03:01:03.520]  something like that we need to defend our constitution now bring back our liberties
[03:01:03.520 --> 03:01:08.640]  and the only way you do it is you're going to have time in 214 and 216 to make the changes
[03:01:08.640 --> 03:01:14.960]  and you have to get engaged on who am i going to elect and what is their podium what are they
[03:01:14.960 --> 03:01:20.000]  standing on what are they telling me they're going absolutely and when they don't do it
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:24.480]  you call them out on it and you change them out i you know term limits would have solved a lot of
[03:01:24.480 --> 03:01:29.520]  this in congress if we had term limits you couldn't get dirt and blackmail people because they're
[03:01:29.520 --> 03:01:35.840]  hearing gone so i think that uh this next two election cycles and everybody says very important
[03:01:35.840 --> 03:01:42.160]  no these are critical these are critical matt drudge says everything is 2014 i think he's right
[03:01:42.160 --> 03:01:47.520]  i think i never heard that from him but i think he's right i think it all hinges on 2014 and it's
[03:01:47.520 --> 03:01:53.200]  so sick that this democratic mafia is so bad i've never been lesser two evils it's but it's clear
[03:01:53.200 --> 03:01:57.120]  they aren't in making their move with obama the power structure behind things they're making their
[03:01:57.120 --> 03:02:01.920]  move yeah and you can see like you said earlier it's an escalation it's happening there's so
[03:02:01.920 --> 03:02:09.120]  much news out there that it hits you and it hits you so fast and they are training americans to
[03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:16.080]  settle for a 45 second to one minute news flash some youtube video and you think you understand
[03:02:16.080 --> 03:02:19.920]  it all and they bang you with exactly and see i've gone through this for a long time but i don't
[03:02:19.920 --> 03:02:24.160]  know if i could say it on air but i mean i get the phone calls and they don't do it a lot now
[03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:28.400]  because they know it doesn't really work it makes me work even harder and gets my wife upset and she
[03:02:28.400 --> 03:02:33.040]  gets behind me even more but you know you pick up the phone and you're making a call and somebody's
[03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:36.480]  breathing on it you said that's happened to you it's happened on my cell phone numerous times
[03:02:36.480 --> 03:02:39.760]  and i mean they want you to know people go all your hair and beeps and breathing that's on how
[03:02:39.760 --> 03:02:44.560]  wiretaps work no they want you to know they're sitting there on your phone my cell phone once
[03:02:44.560 --> 03:02:49.120]  i was driving down the street i'm going to make a telephone call and i'm not even in the ringing
[03:02:49.120 --> 03:02:54.640]  stage yet and i hear what sounds like a police radio come over my cell phone i thought i had my
[03:02:54.640 --> 03:02:59.680]  radio with me and i look in the car it's not in the car it was coming over my cell phone and then
[03:02:59.680 --> 03:03:05.600]  it clicks off then into the call the breathing one one sound like someone sneezed that there was
[03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:10.560]  nobody else on the phone but me you know it was just really some weird well oh wait till they tell
[03:03:10.560 --> 03:03:15.200]  you it's always wait till the family members in the hospital or something and this is happening to me
[03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:19.920]  and my wife that's when you really know how evil they are and they and they call up and go you know
[03:03:19.920 --> 03:03:24.000]  your husband's got me pregnant my wife's like i know this is bull that's right i hope your dad
[03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:29.760]  dies in the hospital right now oh god my wife's not going to fall for that yeah but i mean it's
[03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:34.720]  incredible yeah because her dad had just gone to the hospital and they did it i mean it's like
[03:03:34.720 --> 03:03:41.200]  they're listening and they wait till that emotional moment trying to make you melt down you know i
[03:03:41.200 --> 03:03:44.640]  promise that these calls will do one more segment overdrive 12 minutes how's that sound and then
[03:03:44.640 --> 03:03:48.080]  we'll go shoot for obama deception i don't want to worry out here but i get the idea you can talk
[03:03:48.080 --> 03:03:54.640]  quite a bit man at least we're not buying the propaganda at least we're alive do you really
[03:03:54.640 --> 03:04:00.720]  feel alive doing the right thing though it's taxing i mean i'm sure you know that you know it's taxing
[03:04:00.720 --> 03:04:05.920]  it's something that you know in your heart you have to do and it would be so easy not to it's
[03:04:05.920 --> 03:04:11.520]  a compulsion though it is could you control yourself and not do the right thing no i have to
[03:04:11.520 --> 03:04:16.000]  do the right thing i have to i have to do what i believe in my heart is right what i can lay my
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:21.600]  head on the pillow and know at least i tried to do something with it i may not succeed but at least
[03:04:21.600 --> 03:04:28.080]  i know i gave it everything i could give it well that that's powerful but it's it's it's like a good
[03:04:28.080 --> 03:04:35.840]  slavery to to do the right thing because i i i am not in control of myself i mean i realize and
[03:04:35.840 --> 03:04:40.880]  it's almost embarrassing to say they could have guns to my kids heads and i might be estimate say
[03:04:40.880 --> 03:04:46.240]  okay i'll i'll sell out but i know i really wouldn't i would turn around i mean i can't sell out and
[03:04:46.240 --> 03:04:51.280]  that is a really weird feeling we'll be right back with a final segment in overdrive with our guest

[03:08:19.040 --> 03:08:22.960]  you know share of our pile and then we're going to calls gets demonized a lot and i don't agree
[03:08:22.960 --> 03:08:28.240]  with him on everything he does but i'm usually seeing it through a media filter but now i know a
[03:08:28.240 --> 03:08:34.320]  lot of people i really respect like sheriff richard mack and so many others that behind the scenes
[03:08:34.320 --> 03:08:37.680]  i talk to people that are like know our pile and his neighbors where he you know helps him
[03:08:37.680 --> 03:08:43.200]  change the tire 10 years ago or so friendly and he comes off like a cartoon character like a
[03:08:43.200 --> 03:08:48.560]  almost like a john wane type or something but from what i've been told about and that's really
[03:08:48.560 --> 03:08:52.960]  how he is is that accurate it is i i've gotten the privilege to know sheriff or pile now for
[03:08:52.960 --> 03:08:58.960]  two years i'm in his office all the time and uh he is number one he's a cops cop
[03:08:58.960 --> 03:09:04.320]  he's a real human being and the times i really appreciate it the most is when we're not talking
[03:09:04.320 --> 03:09:09.120]  business and we'll just be sitting there and we'll have a conversation i mean the man is brilliant
[03:09:09.120 --> 03:09:14.160]  the man is a career law enforcement officer he gets it and he's one of the last of the old
[03:09:14.160 --> 03:09:19.360]  time police officers he's the rule of law kind of guy you want him to stop enforcing something
[03:09:19.360 --> 03:09:24.960]  change the law that's how he sees it and they come down on him for enforcing the law they try
[03:09:24.960 --> 03:09:29.440]  to make him erase this because he enforces the law let me tell you something about sheriff or pile
[03:09:29.440 --> 03:09:35.360]  he is an equal opportunity incarcerator oh i've seen that matter but the state is collapsing
[03:09:35.360 --> 03:09:41.280]  they put signs up 60 70 miles in saying don't go into these areas he's supposed to just throw up
[03:09:41.280 --> 03:09:45.920]  his hands and say okay illegals running drugs and stuff you're above the law well that's what
[03:09:45.920 --> 03:09:50.480]  they would like him to do that's something that he is not going to do i mean they they've tried to
[03:09:50.480 --> 03:09:56.320]  stop him they even have federal judges now trying to stop him look uh i'm going to tell you something
[03:09:56.320 --> 03:10:01.280]  sheriff or pile 52 years you take this issue with this birth certificate he wouldn't be having us
[03:10:01.280 --> 03:10:06.560]  doing what we're doing he wouldn't stand out taking the position he's standing out and if he didn't
[03:10:06.560 --> 03:10:12.160]  believe what we have is 100 he's not going to throw away that career on this type of issue
[03:10:12.160 --> 03:10:15.600]  he's not so it's the same thing he knows this right he's got to do it he's got to do it that's
[03:10:15.600 --> 03:10:21.360]  what he is about this has to happen this is what the law says these are violators and we have to
[03:10:21.360 --> 03:10:27.360]  do something about it he doesn't selectively enforce you can't well i always like it when i
[03:10:27.360 --> 03:10:33.440]  see the police arrest their own district attorney or the mayor drunk driving i mean that's good and
[03:10:33.440 --> 03:10:37.680]  the mayor always says you see it over and over again you can't arrest me but then you learn
[03:10:37.680 --> 03:10:42.400]  about the cops that let him go yeah and then it just kind of goes huh it's just i don't know see
[03:10:42.400 --> 03:10:47.360]  if i was a cop i'd let i would let go a poor lady with three kids in the back who didn't
[03:10:47.360 --> 03:10:51.520]  had an inspection sticker out i wouldn't let the mayor go that's where i would have trouble is
[03:10:51.520 --> 03:10:56.400]  writing tickets to to you know the people in their cars obviously out of inspection because
[03:10:56.400 --> 03:11:00.960]  they're because they're they're going bankrupt but then i it's just i don't know how it's a tough
[03:11:00.960 --> 03:11:05.360]  job it's a tough job and you know there's discretion when it comes to that the issuing summons is
[03:11:05.360 --> 03:11:10.720]  but when it comes to driving under the influence i mean it's zero tolerance i mean or when it comes
[03:11:10.720 --> 03:11:15.360]  to shipping drugs in or whatever i mean that goes without saying yeah and then the banks are involved
[03:11:15.360 --> 03:11:20.000]  in it let's take a few phone calls uh here today folks thanks for holding these will be all over
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:27.760]  the map a david in missouri you're on the air go ahead yeah hi um thanks for taking my call um it's
[03:11:27.760 --> 03:11:33.120]  funny because a lot of previous callers and also your guests now are kind of touching on the things
[03:11:33.120 --> 03:11:41.200]  i wanted uh wanted to bring up and that's racism right um since slavery black people have been
[03:11:41.200 --> 03:11:53.200]  used as a beta test um uh to push on the general public and and now and and even in in your shows
[03:11:53.200 --> 03:11:58.560]  in the recent weeks out you've been talking about police oppression right where how the the
[03:11:58.560 --> 03:12:03.520]  checkpoints where they're pulling people out of cars and all this stuff well that's been
[03:12:03.520 --> 03:12:10.480]  happening to to black people in this country for for years now um i was born in the late 60s
[03:12:11.200 --> 03:12:16.960]  um uh and you know in a little bitty small town and and well let me just say this i think it's
[03:12:16.960 --> 03:12:22.560]  poor people period because yeah i've experienced because generally you're gonna have more crime
[03:12:22.560 --> 03:12:27.040]  in poor areas and then and then poor people can't defend themselves so bad police are gonna get away
[03:12:27.040 --> 03:12:32.240]  with more what is your take on you know how much of the persecution of black folks in this country's
[03:12:32.240 --> 03:12:36.640]  real versus what the democratic party hypes up because they can't deliver all the free stuff
[03:12:36.640 --> 03:12:41.920]  they've claimed so they just make it all about race well i i personally my own personal view
[03:12:41.920 --> 03:12:48.240]  i think a lot of it is real i think a lot of it uh you know has happened to some higher degrees
[03:12:48.240 --> 03:12:56.560]  in time periods than others um you know my own personal ideology about this is i i can't look at
[03:12:56.560 --> 03:13:03.440]  that i i have to take you and deal with you based on your actions you know respect begets respect
[03:13:03.440 --> 03:13:09.040]  exactly and the big issue is if you throw minority people especially in jail for little bitty reasons
[03:13:09.040 --> 03:13:13.280]  when they're young they're going to be put in a college of crime yeah i mean that's i think that's
[03:13:13.280 --> 03:13:18.080]  part of the cycle too you know you would love to be able to go in there and and change hearts and
[03:13:18.080 --> 03:13:23.760]  minds you i wish there was something that we can do to you know and i don't want to say make them
[03:13:23.760 --> 03:13:29.920]  productive members of society to me that sounds so pompous make them better for themselves you
[03:13:29.920 --> 03:13:33.920]  know regardless of what color they are i don't care i don't care what you are you look everybody
[03:13:33.920 --> 03:13:39.200]  bleeds let me tell you something i i say this to a lot of people if god forbid something was
[03:13:39.200 --> 03:13:44.320]  happening to your wife some sinister thing was happening would you care what the color of that
[03:13:44.320 --> 03:13:50.000]  cop was to stop that madman well it's the same thing i say care it's like when i look at children
[03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:54.320]  i want to protect all of them yes absolutely i don't care what color they are i mean it doesn't
[03:13:54.320 --> 03:13:59.680]  matter and so it transfers from there doesn't matter doesn't matter you know everybody we all
[03:13:59.680 --> 03:14:05.200]  believe the same brother you know they have the same rights as i do that's all red blood that's
[03:14:05.200 --> 03:14:09.520]  how we're that's how it that's how it works that's how it works well you know to address
[03:14:09.520 --> 03:14:13.920]  this question yeah i believe there were you know improprieties if there's a way to say that
[03:14:13.920 --> 03:14:20.320]  that indiscretions and and some very sinister acts at times and i'm hoping that we're growing
[03:14:20.320 --> 03:14:26.400]  from that you know i know that i can see it in my own children they they they are brought up in a
[03:14:26.400 --> 03:14:32.160]  zero racial environment they don't know the difference you know well that's because people
[03:14:32.880 --> 03:14:37.200]  that's more people they're christians and and people from the 60s and folks they're doing the
[03:14:37.200 --> 03:14:42.800]  right thing but now people are seizing it to reverse it back yeah and then you've got little
[03:14:42.800 --> 03:14:47.280]  kids that that aren't thinking racially about things but then they're having it forced down on
[03:14:47.280 --> 03:14:51.200]  them that they're racist because they're five years old and they're white so so do you see what i'm
[03:14:51.200 --> 03:14:58.480]  saying david well or they're or they're just being exposed to i hate my kids are biracial i'm i'm
[03:14:58.480 --> 03:15:06.000]  black but my my wife is columbian but they're very fair skin they have no idea what what what it is
[03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:14.400]  they have no idea what uh they don't see that color but i'm sure when when they're old enough
[03:15:14.400 --> 03:15:18.960]  and they're driving down the street or whatever and they have a little bit more melanin in their
[03:15:18.960 --> 03:15:24.320]  skin they're going to be treated differently sure sure listen i gotta jump to other collars but but
[03:15:24.320 --> 03:15:29.360]  i hear what you're saying but then it's not just the racism then it enters in the statistics
[03:15:29.360 --> 03:15:34.080]  of the poverty whatever's happened in the culture of the higher crime rates in those areas and those
[03:15:34.080 --> 03:15:39.520]  communities which is a cycle then people get put in jail for no reason because statistically there's
[03:15:39.520 --> 03:15:44.800]  more crime in this area and then they come out basically forced into a criminal system because
[03:15:44.800 --> 03:15:48.320]  now you can't get a job because you've got a criminal record i mean we've all talked about
[03:15:48.320 --> 03:15:53.680]  that cycle here's what i want to say it's become a political diversion from all the other corrupt
[03:15:53.680 --> 03:15:58.880]  things that are going on to obsess over things that are a lot better than they used to be that's
[03:15:58.880 --> 03:16:05.040]  my point let's go real fast here john in florida thanks for holding her on the air i definitely
[03:16:05.040 --> 03:16:09.120]  want to say it's an honor to finally get to speak with you you've been an inspiration to a lot of
[03:16:09.120 --> 03:16:15.120]  us in terms of creating our own radio shows and getting the word out my question what i my statement
[03:16:15.120 --> 03:16:20.480]  to you was down here in florida they have been playing on the race a lot and it has led to a
[03:16:20.480 --> 03:16:27.360]  lot of civil unrest but recently i've realized that it wasn't about the racial split now on all
[03:16:27.360 --> 03:16:32.560]  the news it's all about the gun laws it's all about the stand your ground no no exactly they're
[03:16:32.560 --> 03:16:39.280]  going to racialize i've already seen this owning guns that's what fast and furious was gun owners
[03:16:39.280 --> 03:16:46.720]  are killing mexicans or or you know uh that's the talking point exactly go ahead absolutely and
[03:16:46.720 --> 03:16:52.560]  what i was going to ask you is what angle do you think they're going to take with erin hernandez
[03:16:52.560 --> 03:16:57.200]  the new england patriot star which is essentially the same thing as george there are already
[03:16:57.200 --> 03:17:01.280]  saying he's a white hispanic who killed a black guy but nobody's buying it they know it was all
[03:17:01.280 --> 03:17:06.320]  a bunch of thugs and um i mean if you just look at that whole culture in the nfl that's another
[03:17:06.320 --> 03:17:12.800]  thing why do we allow nfl people to act like thugs they should i mean our role models are you
[03:17:12.800 --> 03:17:16.960]  concerned about them trying to make role models thugs now yeah i think what are the role models
[03:17:16.960 --> 03:17:21.280]  today they're thugs they're thugs they're thugs and and that's being done by design and i don't
[03:17:21.280 --> 03:17:24.640]  care if they're black white hispanic they're all act like a bunch of thugs on the street now
[03:17:24.640 --> 03:17:29.200]  and because i'm gonna tell you if i'm in a gas station see some white thug guys i immediately
[03:17:29.200 --> 03:17:34.000]  you know get threatened black hispanic i don't think that's a black guy i think that's a thug
[03:17:34.000 --> 03:17:38.320]  either acting like a thug you can automatically see a black guy clean cut nice we're hey how you
[03:17:38.320 --> 03:17:43.120]  doing buddy polite you see a white guy clean cut nice hey buddy how you doing but you see a thug
[03:17:43.120 --> 03:17:46.960]  you know the wife beater the whatever bugging their eyes out at you that's the problem is the
[03:17:46.960 --> 03:17:52.400]  thug culture the thug life right and they want to use this you know you if you look at the unfortunate
[03:17:52.400 --> 03:17:57.440]  circumstances down in florida you know in in our constitution you are you are granted the
[03:17:57.440 --> 03:18:02.880]  right to a defense you're presumed innocent and you can have a defense well that doesn't give
[03:18:03.440 --> 03:18:08.400]  the prosecution the right to come up with a fable or create something out of thin
[03:18:08.400 --> 03:18:12.160]  skip this break we're going to bottom of the hour go ahead that isn't there you have to look at what
[03:18:12.160 --> 03:18:17.520]  happened down there that was a crime now following him not following him you know that that could
[03:18:17.520 --> 03:18:21.120]  do you think he was stupid to follow him i think he was stupid i wouldn't have done it but i could
[03:18:21.120 --> 03:18:26.800]  but i could change it what would happen if this was your house your wife was home this guy had
[03:18:26.800 --> 03:18:31.680]  a real intent to do bottle the neighbor had been home invaded right so that's a problem with crime
[03:18:31.680 --> 03:18:36.400]  going up you get charged up that's why you can judge cops but they're charged up all day right
[03:18:36.400 --> 03:18:42.560]  well but taking it to the example if he stopped an individual that was going to do such a grievous
[03:18:42.560 --> 03:18:48.640]  offense be a hero you'd be a hero but this turns into a fight it turns into a fight well the media
[03:18:48.640 --> 03:18:54.080]  made it one yeah don't you think i mean there is reasonable suspicion if a black guy would have
[03:18:54.080 --> 03:18:58.400]  killed a white guy he thought it was suspicious i would have said reasonable suspicion i mean you
[03:18:58.400 --> 03:19:02.880]  don't send somebody to jail unless it's open and shut well you know look everybody's responsible
[03:19:02.880 --> 03:19:08.640]  for their actions just like Zimmerman and more so because he was armed well so was Tramon responsible
[03:19:08.640 --> 03:19:12.400]  for his actions everybody's responsible for their actions well the argument is he had a bag of
[03:19:12.400 --> 03:19:16.960]  skittles but all the witnesses are saying he he attacked him he climbed on top of him and we're
[03:19:16.960 --> 03:19:21.360]  and they they try to lose sight of that to turn it into an issue that they want to turn it into
[03:19:21.360 --> 03:19:25.360]  well i mean here's the issue but when i was 17 i was pretty aggressive and stuff and if i was
[03:19:25.360 --> 03:19:29.440]  walking through and you know something somebody said what are you doing and came up to me i'd
[03:19:29.440 --> 03:19:33.120]  probably say what the hell are you doing with a gun i mean i can get that but i wouldn't punch
[03:19:33.120 --> 03:19:42.640]  somebody well here let's look at that that same scenario if that were if if this was a 110 pound
[03:19:42.640 --> 03:19:48.880]  female who is getting her head bashed into a curb and she's about this individual this would
[03:19:48.880 --> 03:19:53.280]  not even be in a courtroom this wouldn't even be happening i agree with the defense attorney that
[03:19:53.280 --> 03:20:01.200]  this wouldn't have been an issue if uh Zimmerman would have been black most likely not it i hate to
[03:20:01.200 --> 03:20:05.840]  say who's at fault the media for making it racial i think the media does a big part of it they like
[03:20:05.840 --> 03:20:09.760]  to hop it up and make it racial and you know this is going to be what the what the prosecution is
[03:20:09.760 --> 03:20:14.800]  going to use they want to hit an emotion in you to cloud your judgment cloud your thinking well
[03:20:14.800 --> 03:20:19.360]  what about trayvon though because i look at the photos he put out himself with the grill and the
[03:20:19.360 --> 03:20:28.640]  and the thug look and all that those are his photos and uh and then you see the the it guys saying
[03:20:28.640 --> 03:20:32.320]  you know there's photos of guns loot all this stuff and then that's what he's supposed to
[03:20:32.320 --> 03:20:37.600]  gotten trouble in for school the burglary tool and then that's being withheld from the defense
[03:20:37.600 --> 03:20:43.680]  i mean it's starting to really uh not look too good here well you know look the bottom line is
[03:20:43.680 --> 03:20:50.160]  this is a terrible thing no matter how you cut it you have a young man who lost his life um that's
[03:20:50.160 --> 03:20:56.960]  a terrible thing but when you when you're sitting in that jury box you have to put the facts to the
[03:20:56.960 --> 03:21:04.080]  law and that's what everybody has to just realize you know that statue of uh that statue of justice
[03:21:04.080 --> 03:21:10.800]  holding the scales got a blindfold on you have to be blind to all these other factors the actions
[03:21:10.800 --> 03:21:15.280]  either meet the law or they don't meet the law and that's the only thing that these people could
[03:21:15.280 --> 03:21:20.640]  look at so anything that's happening after this is being fueled for other political motivations
[03:21:20.640 --> 03:21:24.640]  that's right and it's easy to monday morning quarterback that jury but when you're about
[03:21:24.640 --> 03:21:30.720]  to put somebody in jail for life you're really going to look at the facts yeah i mean i i didn't
[03:21:30.720 --> 03:21:35.440]  i mean i followed it some every day seen in the news but i mean just looking at the prosecution
[03:21:35.440 --> 03:21:41.200]  clearly hiding evidence uh if the guy was charlie man said he's got to walk because you can't start
[03:21:42.400 --> 03:21:46.560]  cheating people even if they're you think they're guilty in a trial well and i don't know i don't
[03:21:46.560 --> 03:21:50.240]  know the particulars of florida law you know in some jurisdictions you cannot bring in prior
[03:21:50.240 --> 03:21:54.560]  criminal history into a case so i don't know how that's going to play out down there i don't know
[03:21:54.560 --> 03:22:00.960]  what the what their statutes call for but the bottom line you know well they cut out the phone
[03:22:00.960 --> 03:22:08.640]  taken from his dead body had had the had the gun and all the stuff on it recent photos so so so the
[03:22:08.640 --> 03:22:13.120]  issue is they didn't give that to the defense their head it guy was fired a few days ago for leaking
[03:22:13.120 --> 03:22:18.800]  it right he said i'm not going to jail for lying about this right and and again it i think there's
[03:22:18.800 --> 03:22:22.000]  some problems down there with the way they did things don't don't get me wrong well look at the
[03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:27.600]  police chief he said that uh he said that he basically they were ordered to hand the case over
[03:22:27.600 --> 03:22:31.920]  i know i heard that i mean that's what i was trying to allude to earlier if we can't get what we
[03:22:31.920 --> 03:22:35.120]  want in this court we'll just take him somewhere else and take him somewhere else until we get
[03:22:35.120 --> 03:22:40.000]  what we want but i get why obama did that as a gangster and his controllers if you're in trouble
[03:22:40.000 --> 03:22:43.680]  on all this stuff's going on you send down to the justice department to stir up racial animus
[03:22:43.680 --> 03:22:48.320]  because that's a diversion for you while we're all fighting with each other he wins john anything else
[03:22:48.320 --> 03:22:53.760]  well man i just basically wanted to say thank you for everything you do and uh
[03:22:53.760 --> 03:22:58.480]  so far down here in florida it's kind of it's kind of calm but no no question it's going to control
[03:22:58.480 --> 03:23:04.000]  being pushed yeah i mean the white house is now saying let's basically demonize guns and turn our
[03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:09.280]  guns in for trevon they'll be the patron state of victim disarmament that's uh that's been
[03:23:09.280 --> 03:23:13.760]  deployed here for a lot of years trying to figure out a way a catalyst to have that happen
[03:23:13.760 --> 03:23:19.520]  what do you think would happen in six months if they armed all the non-criminal background
[03:23:19.520 --> 03:23:23.360]  families in chicago and taught them how to use the guns i think you'd see a bloodbath of criminals
[03:23:23.360 --> 03:23:27.840]  being killed and then the crime rate would plunge to almost nothing like it is in high gun areas i
[03:23:27.840 --> 03:23:33.680]  would agree every study points to every time you arm the people that the the violent crimes go down
[03:23:33.680 --> 03:23:38.480]  and precipitously they go down look there's nothing wrong with having a good guy on the street with a
[03:23:38.480 --> 03:23:44.000]  gun there just isn't you know in arizona we have the most liberal gun laws you could have i mean
[03:23:44.000 --> 03:23:48.160]  you don't even need a permit now to carry a concealed weapon we treat everybody as if they're
[03:23:48.160 --> 03:23:53.200]  armed that doesn't mean we treat you different we just know it we know that you have one even if
[03:23:53.200 --> 03:23:57.600]  you don't we know that you have one and we just deal with it accordingly but there's no cop on a
[03:23:57.600 --> 03:24:02.240]  street is ever afraid of a law-abiding citizen with a firearm well look at all the examples you
[03:24:02.240 --> 03:24:05.520]  never see in the news that i mean they'll be local where the cops are pinned down and the citizen
[03:24:05.520 --> 03:24:09.440]  from across the street shoots the bad guy and you won't see a lot of those out there or you'll
[03:24:09.440 --> 03:24:13.920]  hear in that news press that they're uh you know reviewing the case for possible charges against
[03:24:13.920 --> 03:24:18.640]  the citizen are you kidding me just about every statute in the country has coming to the aid
[03:24:18.640 --> 03:24:23.280]  of another individual in a fight for their life exactly they try to well the media tries to act
[03:24:23.280 --> 03:24:28.720]  like it was wrong right exactly exactly or or or some guy breaks and enters and the woman's on
[03:24:28.720 --> 03:24:33.120]  911 and they go don't shoot him don't shoot him and then and then she shoots him and they go well
[03:24:33.120 --> 03:24:37.680]  they're looking at charges yeah but of course they don't but they're don't it's not the police
[03:24:37.680 --> 03:24:42.800]  saying they're looking at charges the media says well they're they're reviewing it and they spin that
[03:24:42.800 --> 03:24:47.680]  to mean they're it's incredible well the last one that happened with that the mother home with
[03:24:47.680 --> 03:24:51.520]  her child and she shoots the guy as he's coming in the attic door or something like that or the
[03:24:51.520 --> 03:24:55.760]  closet door i mean she only had five rounds i believe that's a case where i wish he had 15
[03:24:55.760 --> 03:25:00.480]  because he crawled out and went down the street that job wasn't finished you know so you can make
[03:25:00.480 --> 03:25:05.760]  a case for self-defense in today's time it it takes more than one or two bullets and you've
[03:25:05.760 --> 03:25:10.160]  got to have something to match whatever they're able to get yes when you minimize the citizens
[03:25:10.160 --> 03:25:15.520]  you're going to be law-abiding down to one round six rounds like australia it's one round well the
[03:25:15.520 --> 03:25:19.360]  bad guys aren't going to follow the law you know as i had the privilege today a gentleman took me
[03:25:19.360 --> 03:25:24.880]  down to see the alamo and they took me to that i max movie theater and i watched that film for 48
[03:25:24.880 --> 03:25:30.160]  minutes and aside from everything else that that film speaks to you about about the bravery of these
[03:25:30.160 --> 03:25:38.320]  people seeing what one round does one round stops one person and if it's a grazing wound it stops
[03:25:38.320 --> 03:25:43.440]  nobody one round's not going to cut it two rounds aren't going to cut it today you get homes where
[03:25:43.440 --> 03:25:48.000]  doors are kicked in and three or four bad guys come in at the same time you know you're not going
[03:25:48.000 --> 03:25:52.560]  to do it with three four five shots anymore you know there's a reason why police officers are
[03:25:52.560 --> 03:25:57.280]  armed with high capacity automatics today and like the day that's when i started when we had a six
[03:25:57.280 --> 03:26:03.360]  round 357 magnum cops started to lose the gun battles because the bad guys were outgunned you
[03:26:03.360 --> 03:26:08.960]  know they're outgunning us um so you have to look and keep everything into perspective and in today's
[03:26:08.960 --> 03:26:14.800]  society unfortunately yeah an armed citizen is the safest citizen well that's why a lot of people
[03:26:14.800 --> 03:26:20.080]  say don't let the cops have as you know semi-autos 30 around 100 around no fine just let me have that
[03:26:20.640 --> 03:26:25.840]  because i mean obviously they need that because other people are going to have it don't restrict me
[03:26:25.840 --> 03:26:30.560]  just you go ahead and have whatever you want because bad guys again are not going to follow
[03:26:30.560 --> 03:26:34.960]  the law let's talk to ryan in texas he has a question about me so i guess we'll take it but
[03:26:34.960 --> 03:26:41.760]  go ahead hey alex hey buddy go ahead welcome hey i just wanted to uh say thank you for everything
[03:26:41.760 --> 03:26:48.240]  you do and uh you just made your role model for my life uh i'm 19 about to turn 20 and uh
[03:26:49.040 --> 03:26:53.680]  been going organic since i've seen everything about your g you know gmo's and everything
[03:26:53.680 --> 03:27:01.120]  and um just really wanted to ask you you know like how could i help out my community more
[03:27:01.120 --> 03:27:05.920]  and you know like how did you start off you can help out your community by studying history common
[03:27:05.920 --> 03:27:12.000]  sense and volunteering for the salvation army uh being nice to your family working hard being a
[03:27:12.000 --> 03:27:16.240]  good person just being a good person makes the world better people think we've got to all save
[03:27:16.240 --> 03:27:21.440]  the world overnight ourselves being a good person will do it but then you know you'll get better as
[03:27:21.440 --> 03:27:26.160]  you go start a youtube channel don't have to put your face up there put a world map up or whatever
[03:27:26.160 --> 03:27:33.200]  and talk about issues get feedback and be confident because so many good people think it's kind of
[03:27:33.200 --> 03:27:39.040]  like non arrogant to not be confident acting be bold because the bad guys are bold and and just get
[03:27:39.040 --> 03:27:44.880]  it uh but but start i mean it's a it's a common people ask what do you do uh really it starts
