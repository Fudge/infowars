[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  Okay, we're live, it's Sunday night, January 23rd, 2022.
[00:29.000 --> 00:37.000]  And we have just incredibly positive news pouring in from around the world,
[00:37.000 --> 00:45.000]  but particularly in the UK, in Canada, in areas of Europe and here in the US,
[00:45.000 --> 00:54.000]  where there is a total bipartisan populist rejection of the entire fraudulent COVID power grab narrative.
[00:54.000 --> 01:02.000]  Now, that said, I took off a couple days to take care of some family things,
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.000]  and then I did a lot of research late at night.
[01:05.000 --> 01:14.000]  There was a report Greg Rees put out on Friday that was so shocking and so documented on the surface,
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.000]  because I do a lot of research, so I knew everything I was seeing, I'd already documented,
[01:18.000 --> 01:26.000]  that I decided to spend no exaggeration about eight hours, the last two days, eight hours,
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.000]  with the big screen computer up, writing notes going over this,
[01:32.000 --> 01:40.000]  and what Greg Rees put in his report is totally true,
[01:40.000 --> 01:47.000]  and what Dr. Michael Yedon, the former chief scientist at Pfizer, brought forward is totally true.
[01:47.000 --> 01:54.000]  And if everybody in our government and everybody in our culture that sees this information
[01:54.000 --> 02:01.000]  does not break with the people controlling our government and controlling the corporate media and big pharma,
[02:01.000 --> 02:09.000]  then it's a suicide pact, because this is beyond what Hitler did.
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.000]  This is beyond what Mao did, what Stalin did.
[02:13.000 --> 02:18.000]  This stuff makes Genghis Khan look like a sweetheart.
[02:18.000 --> 02:24.000]  So the report went up Friday, I saw it Friday afternoon,
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  and I know Greg's a good researcher, so I didn't think he was wrong, but I said,
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  let me go check this, so I spent three or four hours that night looking at it,
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  then I spent a couple hours yesterday, and then I spent about three more hours today,
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  so I guess it's more than eight hours really, it's probably nine, ten hours.
[02:40.000 --> 02:50.000]  And I'm going to tell you what the report is when we come back, but I went to the VAERS site.
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.000]  I didn't just believe the stuff that Dr. Michael Yedon had put out, even though he's very respected
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.000]  and was the real trailblazer, months before they released the so-called vaccine
[02:59.000 --> 03:06.000]  to predict everything that indeed happened, because he used to head up their whole vaccine program, chief scientist.
[03:06.000 --> 03:10.000]  And I went and checked his numbers, I went and checked the other researchers' numbers,
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  and I went and checked that indeed it was true.
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.000]  And here's why this is important, not just that they've killed a whole bunch of people with this by design
[03:19.000 --> 03:22.000]  and knew what they were doing, and it was literal Russian roulette,
[03:22.000 --> 03:30.000]  so they could track the results of different strengths of this mutinogenic weapon,
[03:30.000 --> 03:38.000]  but that it's all right there and not even hidden.
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  That they have different lots, and the Japanese, that's not even in his report,
[03:43.000 --> 03:51.000]  they looked at a bunch of Pfizer and Moderna shots and said that its different lots are totally different things.
[03:51.000 --> 03:54.000]  It's not like they put more of it in one and less in another.
[03:54.000 --> 03:59.000]  No, it's totally different, all sorts of stuff they've done.
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.000]  They're doing all sorts of mRNA jacking with the public.
[04:03.000 --> 04:11.000]  God knows, God knows where this is going, but obviously this is the greatest crime ever committed in human history,
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  and they're just doing it.
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  So if I've seemed really freaked out, and I've had trouble doing the show, it's because this is all confirmed now,
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  and I get why the public isn't going to be able to handle this, because who could?
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  That's what they're hoping. They're hoping this is so horrible,
[04:31.000 --> 04:38.000]  and they hurry and give people to inject their children that folks aren't going to ever admit they were part of this.
[04:38.000 --> 04:44.000]  So a certain percentage die right away, but who knows with all these secret things they've injected us with,
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  what's even about to happen, but all the scientists said they've looked at it, it's designed to mutate you quickly,
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  kill you or give you cancer, or cause a horrible mutation.
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  So if you're living in a science fiction nightmare, it's unbelievable.
[05:24.000 --> 05:31.000]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[05:31.000 --> 05:36.000]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[05:36.000 --> 05:42.000]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition,
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate,
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.000]  even in affluent populations like here in America.
[05:53.000 --> 06:22.000]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfowarsStore.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[06:23.000 --> 06:36.000]  We've seen all the different Hollywood mouthpieces,
[06:36.000 --> 06:49.000]  you've seen all the different leftist politicians and propagandists from Greta Thunberg to Leonardo DiCaprio and Beto O'Rourke and AOC
[06:49.000 --> 07:00.000]  and we all tell you the earth ends in the year 2030 and that superviruses will come from the jungle and will kill 80 to 90% of you,
[07:00.000 --> 07:06.000]  head of the UT biology department years ago, Pianca said that, Eric Pianca,
[07:06.000 --> 07:11.000]  they're telling you get ready to die, it's your fault, it's coming out of a jungle.
[07:11.000 --> 07:18.000]  But it's not coming out of a jungle or it's not look up coming from an asteroid or a comet.
[07:18.000 --> 07:29.000]  It's coming from Bill Gates and the head of Pfizer and the UN and the New World Order and we have all the documents, all the proof here today.
[07:29.000 --> 07:35.000]  Now obviously I'm risking my life bringing you this information, so is everybody else doing it,
[07:35.000 --> 07:42.000]  but we're not going to have a life anyways if we don't stop this so we might as well fully commit to telling the truth,
[07:42.000 --> 07:51.000]  no matter if they'll set you up and throw you in prison because there won't be a nation anyways very soon if we don't turn this around.
[07:51.000 --> 08:00.000]  And it's our job to warn the world and it's our job to reach out to liberals, conservatives, old, young, black, white, gay, straight,
[08:00.000 --> 08:08.000]  whatever you call yourself to understand you're being targeted by the post-industrial collapse, you're being targeted by the depopulation,
[08:08.000 --> 08:17.000]  you can play along with it, you can wear your mask, you can take your shots, you can be delusional and decide you choose to not believe what I'm saying.
[08:17.000 --> 08:28.000]  Or you can face the facts, do the hard research and deal with reality.
[08:28.000 --> 08:33.000]  So let me start with this and get ready and please get a pen and paper out.
[08:33.000 --> 08:51.000]  Greg Reese, great researcher, put out a report on Friday with news that had broken in the middle of last week after deep, deep research that had been done
[08:51.000 --> 09:04.000]  by Dr. Michael Yedon, the former chief scientist at Pfizer who retired just three years ago and other well-known statisticians and researchers, it's all documented and linked in the video.
[09:04.000 --> 09:11.000]  Evidence that U.S. government targeted red states with deadly batches of vaccine.
[09:11.000 --> 09:19.000]  Now out of that video that's got 800,000 views at Band-Aught Video, it needs 50 million to turn the world around and that's up to you to get it out.
[09:19.000 --> 09:31.000]  There's another article now on InfoWars.com that boils it down tonight, this Sunday evening, by Jamie White that has the direct links to the proof and evidence in it along with the video.
[09:31.000 --> 09:45.000]  And here is that report, breaking red states targeted with tainted COVID vaccines warns former top science advisor.
[09:45.000 --> 09:50.000]  I added the word top.
[09:50.000 --> 10:12.000]  Now, let me show you the live show headline for the broadcast today. Sunday live, globalist attacking red states with deadly tainted COVID vaccines, top scientists confirm.
[10:12.000 --> 10:15.000]  And that's the live feed of what you're watching right now.
[10:15.000 --> 10:21.000]  So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to play the report and then I'm going to tell you the rest of the story in the next segment.
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  But here's the issue.
[10:23.000 --> 10:33.000]  I went and spent hours Friday, hours Saturday and hours today going into the VAERS reporting system, going into the documents that have come out and confirmed from lawsuits,
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.000]  going into the court documents released by the FDA under court order.
[10:37.000 --> 10:43.000]  Going into prison for 75 years. Everything in this report is dead on.
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  And this is the smoking gun of depopulation.
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  They know the very lots that were sent out.
[10:50.000 --> 10:56.000]  They then track via the VAERS and their own reporting system, working in tandem.
[10:56.000 --> 11:06.000]  These three vaccine makers that were set up by DASIC and set up by Gates before it was even announced two years ago to make the vaccine for COVID-19.
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.000]  That's not come out. I have articles on that today.
[11:09.000 --> 11:17.000]  And witnesses have come out of the Wuhan lab saying the CIA was really running it and that Peter DASIC was CIA, of course.
[11:17.000 --> 11:30.000]  So they're all going public now. People have their life force kicking in, their preservation centers and instincts kicking in.
[11:30.000 --> 11:36.000]  And so it's confirmed that they sent out these poison lots and that they tracked them and that they coordinated and watched.
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.000]  And then almost everybody else got placebo.
[11:41.000 --> 11:47.000]  But the lots and the Japanese found this too. They were the first over a year ago to start reporting on this are totally different.
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.000]  There's different mRNA. A lot of them, nothing to do with COVID.
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.000]  It's all sorts of mutinogenic manipulations of your DNA.
[11:57.000 --> 12:04.000]  This is so incredible.
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  So I'm going to air his report.
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  And I want to encourage all of you to go to Band-Aid video while you still can.
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.000]  And to download it, to take clips of it, to share it, I don't care what you do with it.
[12:14.000 --> 12:20.000]  Just get it out to all the medical doctors, all the scientists, all the police departments, everyone you know.
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.000]  This is like Soylent Green at the end of the movie where he says, Soylent Green is made out of people.
[12:25.000 --> 12:28.000]  You got to warn him, you got to tell him, except this is real.
[12:28.000 --> 12:41.000]  Here is Greg Reese's report. Get it and share it.
[12:59.000 --> 13:05.000]  These vaccines have been deployed in different batches, officially referred to as lots.
[13:05.000 --> 13:13.000]  This has allowed Eden's team to back engineer Big Pharma's COVID-19 vaccine deployment agenda in the US.
[13:13.000 --> 13:19.000]  All their information is published at HowBadIsMyBatch.com and HowBad.info.
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  And what we learn is quite telling.
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  About 0.5% of all the different batches are highly toxic.
[13:27.000 --> 13:33.000]  Resulting in hospitalization, disability, and death within days or weeks of injection.
[13:33.000 --> 13:39.000]  Other batches cause minimal adverse reactions and most appear to be harmless placebos.
[13:39.000 --> 13:50.000]  When plotting on a timeline, we can see that these three companies have been working together to quietly monitor the lethal effectiveness of specific deadly batches.
[13:50.000 --> 14:00.000]  While one company is deploying a lethal batch, the other two deploy harmless ones, creating the scientific environment to perform dose range finding,
[14:00.000 --> 14:04.000]  or the maximum tolerated dose for each specific batch.
[14:04.000 --> 14:11.000]  The timeline shows that each lethal batch deployment is preceded and followed by a quiet period,
[14:11.000 --> 14:17.000]  allowing them time to establish their baseline before the next deadly batch is deployed.
[14:17.000 --> 14:24.000]  Private leaked documents from the CDC show a list of expiry dates, and only certain lots are included.
[14:24.000 --> 14:29.000]  The very same lots found to be highly toxic in part of Cooper's database.
[14:29.000 --> 14:35.000]  Which makes sense. There would be no reason to list expiration dates for saline placebo.
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  Only the deadly ones.
[14:37.000 --> 14:46.000]  This mode of deployment allows governments the ability to direct deadly batches into specific populations, such as red states.
[14:46.000 --> 14:57.000]  Analysis of the number of dying per 100,000 vaccinated in 50 states shows us that the overwhelming majority of vaccine deaths are happening in red states.
[14:57.000 --> 15:03.000]  Some red states are experiencing 11 times more vaccine deaths than other states.
[15:03.000 --> 15:09.000]  On average, red states are experiencing twice the amount of vaccine death and injuries than blue states.
[15:09.000 --> 15:21.000]  After ruling out other possibilities, part of Cooper concluded that this can only be due to the fact that red states received at least twice as much of the lethal batches than blue states did.
[15:21.000 --> 15:33.000]  Among several other crimes, they are tipping the scales of the democratic process by killing people who voted against the New World Order's woke, build back better, great reset.
[15:33.000 --> 15:40.000]  While at the same time, endlessly flooding the borders with unvaccinated foreigners.
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  And it's happening right now.
[15:43.000 --> 16:07.000]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[16:07.000 --> 16:14.000]  We will follow the facts wherever they lead.
[16:14.000 --> 16:38.000]  The days of independent media are numbered. The government has made it illegal to oppose them.
[16:38.000 --> 16:49.000]  So be it. Make them silence us by force. This is the final battle of the information war. Give now. Buy products. Donate.
[16:49.000 --> 17:09.000]  Before everything changes, we need you to carry us through to the end. Victory or death, go now to infowarstore.com.
[17:09.000 --> 17:21.000]  I love your products. I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[17:21.000 --> 17:30.000]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually. People think I'm 55 years old.
[17:30.000 --> 17:39.000]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[17:39.000 --> 17:50.000]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately. But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know.
[17:50.000 --> 18:02.000]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[18:02.000 --> 18:09.000]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[18:09.000 --> 18:16.000]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[18:16.000 --> 18:21.000]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really, they're just a commune.
[18:21.000 --> 18:26.000]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it. And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.000]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[18:30.000 --> 18:34.000]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.000]  It's Wake Up America Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[18:41.000 --> 18:46.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[18:46.000 --> 18:49.000]  Yeah, I'd like to. You wouldn't believe it.
[18:49.000 --> 18:53.000]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[18:53.000 --> 19:21.000]  And if you don't fund us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[19:21.000 --> 19:30.000]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com.

[19:50.000 --> 19:55.000]  Get your Faraday cages at infowarstore.com. Check out the new line. It's amazing.
[20:20.000 --> 20:32.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[20:32.000 --> 20:37.000]  On air 28 years, only here because of your support and your prayers.
[20:37.000 --> 20:42.000]  And just like America and just like the world, we are bloodied.
[20:42.000 --> 20:54.000]  We are battered, but we have been vindicated and our souls and our spirits are stronger than they've ever been.
[20:54.000 --> 21:04.000]  And unfortunately, InfoWars is about to get a lot more powerful and a lot more influential because the horror is going to start dawning on people that we were dead on.
[21:04.000 --> 21:13.000]  Not because we wanted to be, but because we were and we knew what we were up against and we were really sad to have to tell you the horrible news of what we were facing.
[21:13.000 --> 21:21.000]  But I believed in you and I believe that once you were faced with it, you would wake up and say no, and that's beginning to happen.
[21:21.000 --> 21:32.000]  But the process of InfoWars being vindicated is not going to be a pleasant one for yours truly because the enemy has and will come for me.
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  So every broadcast and every day we have together is very special.
[21:36.000 --> 21:42.000]  But it's up to men particularly, but adults in the greater equation to stand up for the children.
[21:42.000 --> 21:52.000]  So I'm simply carrying out the role, as my ancestors did, to be a guardian of the people and to tell the truth and to follow that path no matter how destructive it may be.
[21:52.000 --> 21:59.000]  And I say that because I want to encourage all of you to not care if you get made fun of or get fired from your job or whatever happens.
[21:59.000 --> 22:03.000]  Because there's no future if we don't stop this.
[22:03.000 --> 22:09.000]  If we don't have civil disobedience and if we don't spread this information, we don't have a hope.
[22:09.000 --> 22:15.000]  And God will judge us for not standing up for the children and being cowards.
[22:15.000 --> 22:19.000]  And God is what really matters.
[22:19.000 --> 22:22.000]  Plus we'll all be destroyed by the globalist.
[22:22.000 --> 22:25.000]  It's the only choice is to resist.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  Resistance is life.
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  Submission is death.
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  Resistance is victory.
[22:32.000 --> 22:37.000]  Submission is slavery.
[22:37.000 --> 22:41.000]  We're going to have to have some suffering here.
[22:41.000 --> 22:48.000]  We're going to have to have suffering because nothing good is gained without it.
[22:48.000 --> 23:00.000]  And you notice those that serve the system are suffering the worst living in those soulless blue cities under the satanic control of the globalist.
[23:00.000 --> 23:08.000]  But I spoke of the good news, but if you just joined us, I did a lot of preparation for this broadcast and I just thought to myself,
[23:08.000 --> 23:15.000]  how do I cover all this other news and turn my back on the biggest story?
[23:15.000 --> 23:21.000]  Because all of this information is over the top and all of it ties back to the same supervillains that are doing this.
[23:21.000 --> 23:28.000]  But this information right here, if you're a radio listener, you must go to infowars.com.
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.000]  You must get the video. You must share it.
[23:32.000 --> 23:37.000]  Sunday Live Globalists Attacking Red States with deadly tainted COVID vaccines.
[23:37.000 --> 23:44.000]  Top scientists confirm they've confirmed the deadly batches.
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  So have the Japanese.
[23:46.000 --> 23:50.000]  This is in the times of Tokyo.
[23:50.000 --> 23:58.000]  They have confirmed that in some states it's 11 to 1 against red areas.
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  But on average, double.
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.000]  A bombing campaign.
[24:03.000 --> 24:13.000]  And then the other people either get saltwater, placebo or other weird mutinogens, other weird mRNA.
[24:13.000 --> 24:16.000]  So they're given to some people, placebos, the majority.
[24:16.000 --> 24:22.000]  They're giving others weird mRNA mutations that are designed to cause mutations in cancer.
[24:22.000 --> 24:28.000]  And then others are given a kill shot, a death shot.
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  I mean, down to the, and then of course it's the deadly lots that they say expire, that they tell people,
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  oh, this lot you've got to refrigerate, but these other lots you don't.
[24:37.000 --> 24:43.000]  And these pharmacies in places, that's why only big giant select companies are allowed to do it.
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.000]  Walmart and CVS and Walgreens.
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  They don't let your local doctor do this.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  They don't let, because they got to control it.
[24:50.000 --> 24:56.000]  But we've seen in the parliaments in Europe and in the government councils, the head health official saying,
[24:56.000 --> 24:59.000]  I went to inspect the shipments from Pfizer.
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  I played the clubs two weeks ago.
[25:01.000 --> 25:07.000]  We checked them, there are three types, placebo, mutinogen and kill shot.
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.000]  It's all true.
[25:10.000 --> 25:17.000]  Saltwater shot, mutation shot, death shot.
[25:17.000 --> 25:25.000]  And they go in with the mutation shots and those get expiration dates and so do the kill shots,
[25:25.000 --> 25:26.000]  but not the saline.
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.000]  I mean, and they've confirmed all over people testing,
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.000]  they go, this is saline, all this is saline.
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.000]  And it gets worse.
[25:36.000 --> 25:39.000]  They're targeting the children now.
[25:39.000 --> 25:44.000]  The evidence is showing in blue cities as well at the school clinics,
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.000]  they're starting to do with the mutation shots, not the kill shots.
[25:49.000 --> 25:56.000]  My God, ladies and gentlemen, we are, again, this isn't some Marvel comic movie.
[25:56.000 --> 26:01.000]  It sounds like one, doesn't it, where a crazy evil corporation wants to mutate all the public and like works for aliens or something.
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  I mean, I don't know what's going on.
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  I just know this is happening.
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.000]  And Senator Paul finally, he's a medical doctor, came out against the vaccine.
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.000]  We have that clip coming up next segment and said it is child abuse.
[26:15.000 --> 26:19.000]  It is medical malpractice to give children this shot.
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  That's the beginning and that's what I demanded he do.
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.000]  That's what I demanded you call and tell him to do because he knows damn well.
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  And if we want to get mad at Trump, who's not a medical doctor,
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  for buying into this, when Rand Paul advised him to do it,
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  because Rand Paul didn't know what they were doing.
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.000]  He saw people dying.
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.000]  He saw shutdowns.
[26:37.000 --> 26:38.000]  He said, yeah, make a vaccine.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  He knows other vaccines work.
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  They can be tainted or they can be jacked with.
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.000]  They can have Trojan horses, but it's a real science.
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  It was like, yeah, let's get this going.
[26:47.000 --> 26:50.000]  He advised Trump, Trump did it.
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.000]  I'm mad at Trump at about a three.
[26:53.000 --> 26:57.000]  And I'm mad at Rand Paul at about a 50.
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  And I'm mad at Biden at about a 10.
[26:59.000 --> 27:00.000]  And why is that?
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  Because Biden's an evil demon.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  I mean, demons do what demons do.
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.000]  Trump's arrogant narcissist means well, but, you know, believes whatever he wants to.
[27:08.000 --> 27:09.000]  Positive thinker.
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  And then Paul knows damn well.
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  And I don't think he's a bad guy.
[27:14.000 --> 27:17.000]  He's been shot at, his ribs have been broken, attacked, lungs punctured.
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  I get there after him.
[27:19.000 --> 27:20.000]  You got to do it, Paul.
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.000]  And you're doing it.
[27:21.000 --> 27:22.000]  Good.
[27:22.000 --> 27:25.000]  We knew you were good, Rand Paul.
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.000]  We knew you were good.
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  And they may kill you brother, but you won't be a murderer.
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  You won't be a Joseph Mengele's helper.
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.000]  You won't be like Joseph Mengele's Santa Claus.
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  And you're one of the little elves with Fauci helping along here.
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  We can't help Satan Claus.
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.000]  We can't be the little elves that go along with it and get our little paycheck from the
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  New World Order to play along.
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  No, we got to put ourselves in front of the tanks for the children.
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.000]  And the tanks are coming as syringes.
[27:52.000 --> 27:59.000]  And our enemy generals are the head of Pfizer and the head of Moderna and Bill Gates and
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  Peter Dazik and all the rest of them.
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  And yeah, they're powerful.
[28:03.000 --> 28:04.000]  And they're killers.
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  And it's scary to go up against them.
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.000]  But it's a lot more scary to sit there in the dark like a damn coward and let these killers
[28:11.000 --> 28:15.000]  get away with this because they're not going to get away with it.
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  Never!
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  You will pay for what you've done, make no mistake, you murdering trash.
[28:22.000 --> 28:27.000]  But remember, we don't do this because we hate these people.
[28:27.000 --> 28:33.000]  And I ask God to give me control not to be hateful because it hurts me as much as it hurts.
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  Do it for the children and do it for love.
[28:35.000 --> 28:36.000]  I'm going to play a clip.
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.000]  The famous military saying is totally true when we come back.
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  We don't do this because we hate those in front of us that we're fighting.
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.000]  We do it because we love those that are behind us.
[28:45.000 --> 28:51.000]  And they demand the children and the innocent demand that those of us that are informed
[28:51.000 --> 28:59.000]  and know what's going on stand up against this and we will stay with us.
[28:59.000 --> 29:06.000]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[29:06.000 --> 29:12.000]  Infowars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[29:12.000 --> 29:19.000]  This infowars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the infowars store.
[29:19.000 --> 29:26.000]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[29:26.000 --> 29:33.000]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions including those with osteoarthritis
[29:33.000 --> 29:37.000]  and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[29:37.000 --> 29:42.000]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition,
[29:42.000 --> 29:46.000]  immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[29:46.000 --> 29:52.000]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations like here in America.
[29:52.000 --> 29:59.000]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[29:59.000 --> 30:07.000]  We here at Infowars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that is now available at infowarsstore.com.
[30:07.000 --> 30:11.000]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today,
[30:11.000 --> 30:18.000]  though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[30:18.000 --> 30:23.000]  According to ancient Samoan legend Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[30:23.000 --> 30:28.000]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[30:28.000 --> 30:34.000]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[30:34.000 --> 30:39.000]  Nowadays Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[30:39.000 --> 30:44.000]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava,
[30:44.000 --> 30:51.000]  but other herbs including but not limited to German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap and Balerian root.
[30:51.000 --> 30:59.000]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting infowarsstore.com.
[30:59.000 --> 31:03.000]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in Infowars Live products,
[31:03.000 --> 31:06.000]  and that's why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth,
[31:06.000 --> 31:10.000]  and we could never get the ingredients again until now,
[31:10.000 --> 31:16.000]  and we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[31:16.000 --> 31:21.000]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level. Listen to what it's got in it.
[31:21.000 --> 31:26.000]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[31:26.000 --> 31:31.000]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder,
[31:31.000 --> 31:36.000]  and a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants,
[31:36.000 --> 31:40.000]  and then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium and sodium added.
[31:40.000 --> 31:42.000]  I mean this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[31:42.000 --> 31:48.000]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt,
[31:48.000 --> 31:52.000]  and it just goes on and on. It is now back in stock, Ultimate Bone Broth Plus,
[31:52.000 --> 31:58.000]  available at 20% off and free shipping out of the gates at Infowarsstore.com.
[31:58.000 --> 32:05.000]  Both of these amazing products have been sold out for almost half a year because of supply chain breakdowns.
[32:05.000 --> 32:09.000]  You've done a great job supporting Infowars and supporting your immune system.
[32:09.000 --> 32:14.000]  The problem is with all the COVID lockdowns, the Great Reset, we can't get these products in.
[32:14.000 --> 32:21.000]  So finally they came in, but a limited run of our whole food, vitamin, mineral, essential, nutrient.
[32:21.000 --> 32:26.000]  Multivitamins, so you absorb it and so it's not toxic in your body like synthetic vitamins.
[32:26.000 --> 32:31.000]  And then of course vitamin C and zinc. This sucker is really full and heavy
[32:31.000 --> 32:35.000]  because it's a huge dose of vitamin C and zinc and roseps.
[32:35.000 --> 32:38.000]  Number one thing you can do for your immune system and your body, it does so much more.
[32:38.000 --> 32:44.000]  Both of these are now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com for 40% off.
[32:44.000 --> 32:48.000]  I'm going to keep them at that price until they sell out because of supply chain breakdowns.
[32:48.000 --> 32:53.000]  We've got a limited run, so please take action now and order them at Infowarsstore.com.
[32:53.000 --> 32:56.000]  But whatever you do, find similar products out there and use them
[32:56.000 --> 33:09.000]  because this is a life and death situation to be healthy.
[33:26.000 --> 33:32.000]  And the heart of the resistance, it's Alex Jones.
[33:32.000 --> 33:39.000]  So the opening salvo of a biomedical global dictatorship
[33:39.000 --> 33:43.000]  to right off the bat start killing people to get the whole medical system involved
[33:43.000 --> 33:48.000]  so they can corrupt them and blackmail them has begun.
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.000]  0.5% of the injections are lethal.
[33:53.000 --> 33:58.000]  Another large portion but still a minority of the injections is a mutation injection
[33:58.000 --> 34:04.000]  of different types to mutate you and make you either die or have cancer but down the road.
[34:04.000 --> 34:07.000]  And then the rest is saltwater, the vast majority.
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  It's all confirmed. It's actually, they admit it.
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.000]  It's all right in the documents. It's all right there in the VAERS reports.
[34:13.000 --> 34:16.000]  It's right there in the CDC documents and in lawsuits that have come out,
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  the documents that have been released.
[34:18.000 --> 34:21.000]  That's why Pfizer and others asked for 75 years.
[34:21.000 --> 34:24.000]  That's why they got governments to give them blanket immunity all over the world
[34:24.000 --> 34:30.000]  to sign over national parks and infrastructure if there were any deaths or problems
[34:30.000 --> 34:35.000]  because the governments directed this with Big Pharma and the UN.
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  And think about the commitment of this group.
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  Think about the will.
[34:39.000 --> 34:44.000]  Think about the other plans they've got to distract us from this coming out
[34:44.000 --> 34:46.000]  and how it gives them a world ID
[34:46.000 --> 34:53.000]  and how they blame the dead and dying on the supposed viruses when it's the injection that's doing it.
[34:53.000 --> 34:57.000]  This is a scientific attack and only realizing that will be able to save us
[34:57.000 --> 35:04.000]  and that's why it's been top scientists, the discoverer of HIV, Nobel Prize winner,
[35:04.000 --> 35:11.000]  the inventor of mRNA, the chief scientist at Pfizer, the chief EU advisor.
[35:11.000 --> 35:18.000]  It's all the who's who that told us this will cause infertility.
[35:18.000 --> 35:19.000]  This will cause cancer.
[35:19.000 --> 35:23.000]  If I was going to cook something up to attack fast-growing cells in the body,
[35:23.000 --> 35:24.000]  I would do this.
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  This will attack children particularly.
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.000]  That's what the spike protein goes after.
[35:29.000 --> 35:32.000]  It's incredible that they did this.
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  It's World War IV, folks.
[35:34.000 --> 35:40.000]  It's global corporate government against us with them posing as the savior while they kill us.
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.000]  And again, if you just joined us, Dr. Michael Yeadon,
[35:44.000 --> 35:48.000]  former chief scientist at Pfizer and top statisticians have confirmed.
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  This has been going on for six months.
[35:50.000 --> 35:59.000]  They've been compiling all this, but now specifically that they send out the poison batches and that those expire.
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.000]  And then they don't ever expire at the saline.
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  And that's why people will be at Walgreens.
[36:04.000 --> 36:05.000]  They'll spend on the news.
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  They'll, yeah, we get some we're supposed to of the same company.
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.000]  But the refrigerator, they say, this doesn't need to be.
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  That's how dumb they think we are.
[36:13.000 --> 36:16.000]  The truck pulls up with, oh, this is Pfizer.
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  That need to be put in the refrigerator.
[36:18.000 --> 36:21.000]  But this does.
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  And that's why it's been on the news.
[36:23.000 --> 36:24.000]  It's been confirmed.
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.000]  People will line up and they'll go, oh, let me check your license.
[36:27.000 --> 36:28.000]  We scan it.
[36:28.000 --> 36:29.000]  They don't know why.
[36:29.000 --> 36:30.000]  Okay, you get this one.
[36:30.000 --> 36:31.000]  You get that one.
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  They've even got you in a database on what you're going to get.
[36:33.000 --> 36:37.000]  So you pull up and they swab you and it's at a big clinic outside and the military comes over.
[36:37.000 --> 36:38.000]  They're like, let me check your ID.
[36:38.000 --> 36:39.000]  I'll be right back.
[36:39.000 --> 36:40.000]  I'm pushing the database.
[36:40.000 --> 36:41.000]  Okay.
[36:41.000 --> 36:42.000]  Okay.
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  They go, okay, let me get this shot for you.
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.000]  They're not even asking why they're different shots, but some people are.
[36:49.000 --> 36:53.000]  He realized this is, it's like an IQ test though.
[36:53.000 --> 36:56.000]  Who would go along with this?
[36:56.000 --> 37:03.000]  Who would accept this?
[37:03.000 --> 37:07.000]  I mean, it's, it's, it's just incredible.
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  So the report with all the links is on info wars.com.
[37:11.000 --> 37:17.000]  And it's in the report by Gregory's breaking red states targeted with tainted COVID vaccines warrants
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.000]  former science advisor to Pfizer.
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  And you had to have to a scientist say, don't give this to anybody.
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.000]  So they had them step down.
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  And they said, don't give it to kids.
[37:25.000 --> 37:26.000]  They had to step down.
[37:26.000 --> 37:27.000]  Same thing in the UK.
[37:27.000 --> 37:31.000]  Six months ago, eight months ago, they got a yellow card from the main regulatory body
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  saying pull it and they didn't pull it.
[37:35.000 --> 37:39.000]  I remember a year and a half ago when they started out in England, the first country, the UK military said,
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  Oh, you should stop the vaccine.
[37:41.000 --> 37:42.000]  And they said, Nope.
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  And they said, okay, well, don't give it to under 16 over 75 or pregnant, please.
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  The military had a little hard.
[37:49.000 --> 37:54.000]  And it's, but oh no, the bureaucrats in Boris Johnson said, you're going to do it.
[37:54.000 --> 37:55.000]  Be a hero.
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.000]  I saw this ad on television yesterday.
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  My daughter wanted to watch some cartoons.
[38:01.000 --> 38:04.000]  I'm flipping around and I saw this little black girl walk up to her dad.
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  She goes, daddy, I'm scared of the virus.
[38:06.000 --> 38:07.000]  He goes, it's okay, baby.
[38:07.000 --> 38:08.000]  We're all going to take the shot.
[38:08.000 --> 38:09.000]  We're going to be safe.
[38:09.000 --> 38:17.000]  How damn evil is that?
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  And they just hope it's so diabolical.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  It's so dark that we can't deal with it.
[38:21.000 --> 38:25.000]  All right.
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  The oath to serve your country.
[38:27.000 --> 38:28.000]  Here it is.
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  And this is for the whole planet, not just Australia.
[38:30.000 --> 38:47.000]  Here it is.
[38:47.000 --> 38:51.000]  Men and women of the Australian Defense Force, both serving and retired,
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  volunteers or national service men and women, veterans all,
[38:55.000 --> 39:00.000]  we are at a point in history without precedent or war for the world.
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  And many of you know that truly malevolent forces have been attacking
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.000]  and undermining our nation for longer than most of us have lived.
[39:08.000 --> 39:13.000]  They, our adversaries have executed their monstrous plans against innocent men,
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.000]  women and children.
[39:16.000 --> 39:21.000]  They fight with a pre biblical barbarity, without decency and without constraint.
[39:21.000 --> 39:24.000]  They fight without courage and without compassion.
[39:24.000 --> 39:29.000]  Their war against the people is undeclared total war.
[39:29.000 --> 39:34.000]  It has been a traitor's war, a dirty war, a coward's war.
[39:34.000 --> 39:39.000]  We know only too well that unless we halt and then reverse this unrelenting attack
[39:39.000 --> 39:43.000]  on every aspect of our lives, we will lose everything we love
[39:43.000 --> 39:50.000]  and enter a period of civilizational darkness more depraved than any period in human history.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  We must act.
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  However, this is not a call to arms.
[39:55.000 --> 40:00.000]  Our soulless adversaries and their mindless enablers would like nothing better
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  than for a shot to be fired.
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.000]  Because to do so would legitimize in the minds of many subnambulient Australians
[40:07.000 --> 40:12.000]  further unconstitutional and unlawful constraints on our rights to our lives,
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  our liberty and our property.
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  We will not give them that excuse.
[40:17.000 --> 40:21.000]  We know we never fight on ground of the enemy's choosing.
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  We must fight.
[40:23.000 --> 40:26.000]  But in doing so, we must win the people.
[40:26.000 --> 40:32.000]  At every opportunity, we must stand with the people unarmed but in uniform.
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.000]  Our weapon, pure courage.
[40:35.000 --> 40:40.000]  We took an oath to serve our nation and what is our nation if not the people?
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.000]  By our presence in uniform, alongside and with the people,
[40:44.000 --> 40:49.000]  we are sending a powerful, unambiguous and galvanizing message
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  that in this war for the world, we the people are united and invincible.
[40:54.000 --> 41:00.000]  We must demonstrate the pure courage born of love of family and love of country
[41:00.000 --> 41:05.000]  that beats in the heart of every soldier, sailor and airman.
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  Because what is courage but love in action?
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.000]  And if you love someone or something enough,
[41:11.000 --> 41:15.000]  you will do what must be done regardless of the cost to you.
[41:15.000 --> 41:19.000]  Perhaps we will lose our property. If so, what of it?
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  We can always acquire more.
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  Perhaps we will lose our liberty.
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  If so, what of it?
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  We can eventually be set free.
[41:28.000 --> 41:31.000]  Perhaps we will lose our lives.
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  If so, what of it?
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.000]  There are destinies much worse than death.
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.000]  These sentiments are too much for most to understand, much less accept.
[41:40.000 --> 41:45.000]  And that is all the more reason for us, for you, to stand with the people.
[41:45.000 --> 41:50.000]  Now you might be challenged to explain why you chose such a course of action.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  The answer is simple.
[41:52.000 --> 42:00.000]  You will be doing what military law, civilian law and just plain common decency require and demand.
[42:00.000 --> 42:05.000]  You are disobeying the unlawful commands given by the admirals, generals and air marshals
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.000]  of the Australian Defence Force to participate in the genocide of the Australian people.
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.000]  They are guilty and you will be innocent.
[42:13.000 --> 42:18.000]  The oath to serve your country as a soldier did not include a contract
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.000]  for the normal luxuries and comforts enjoyed within our society.
[42:22.000 --> 42:28.000]  On the contrary, it implied hardship, loyalty and devotion to duty regardless of rank.
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen of the Australian Defence Force,
[42:31.000 --> 42:37.000]  it is time for you to serve not the admirals, not the generals and not the air marshals.
[42:37.000 --> 42:44.000]  But to endure hardship, show loyalty and do your duty for your country and your people.
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  And remember that in the words of G.K. Chesterton,
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.000]  we fight not because we hate what is in front of us,
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  but because we love what is behind us.
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.000]  I'm Ricardo Bose, National Leader of Australia One. Thank you.
[42:58.000 --> 43:03.000]  Neutropics is a fancy way of saying brain pill.
[43:03.000 --> 43:07.000]  And it is the fastest growing market and supplements in the world.
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  For good reason.
[43:09.000 --> 43:13.000]  There are a lot of amazing compounds out there, some healthy, some not,
[43:13.000 --> 43:16.000]  that do incredible things in our brains.
[43:16.000 --> 43:19.000]  And we've tried them all, we've researched them all,
[43:19.000 --> 43:22.000]  and we will not sell you anything that is linked to any problems
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.000]  or any type of toxicity or any type of extreme hangovers.
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  I mean, because I'm not saying some of our brain products,
[43:28.000 --> 43:30.000]  you won't have a little bit of a let down once you take them,
[43:30.000 --> 43:31.000]  but that would just be a lie.
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  But these are very, very clean of compounds that God gave us that are good for you.
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.000]  And one of our best sellers is back in stock, Brain Force Plus,
[43:39.000 --> 43:43.000]  a good, clean, Neutropic, a good, clean brain pill.
[43:43.000 --> 43:45.000]  You can find stuff that's stronger, but it's not good for you.
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  This is a high quality system.
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  It's available at infowarstore.com.
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.000]  It's sold out for a long time at 40% off.
[43:52.000 --> 43:55.000]  So get your Brain Force Plus today at infowarstore.com
[43:55.000 --> 43:56.000]  to help keep us on air.
[43:56.000 --> 44:25.000]  Thank you so much, and I'll see you out there.
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.000]  Another reason I'm very, very excited about this is,
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.000]  this will fund our operation and keep us on air.
[44:31.000 --> 44:35.000]  So again, it's a 360 win, but whatever you do,
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  go out and get an organic, whole food, multivitamin,
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  and take vitamin C and take zinc.
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  And we also have some great vitamin D products
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  at infowarstore.com you can eat as well.
[44:45.000 --> 44:48.000]  But whatever you do, defend your body's immune system.
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.000]  We want to keep patriots in the game against the New World Order.
[44:51.000 --> 44:52.000]  So it's a 360 win.
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  Hit something essential to your body and your health
[44:54.000 --> 44:56.000]  and your longevity and your immune system
[44:56.000 --> 44:59.000]  while funding the infowar at infowarstore.com.
[44:59.000 --> 45:02.000]  Both of these amazing products have been sold out
[45:02.000 --> 45:06.000]  for almost half a year because of supply chain breakdowns.
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.000]  You've done a great job supporting info wars
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  and supporting your immune system.
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  The problem is, with all the COVID lockdowns,
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  the Great Reset, we can't get these products in.
[45:14.000 --> 45:17.000]  So finally, they came in but a limited run
[45:17.000 --> 45:21.000]  of our whole food, vitamin, mineral, essential, nutrient,
[45:21.000 --> 45:24.000]  multivitamin so you absorb it and so it's not toxic
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  in your body like synthetic vitamins.
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  And then, of course, vitamin C and zinc.
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.000]  This sucker is really full and heavy
[45:31.000 --> 45:35.000]  because it's a huge dose of vitamin C and zinc and roseps.
[45:35.000 --> 45:37.000]  Number one thing you can do if you're immune system
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  and your body, it does so much more.
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  Both of these are now back in stock
[45:41.000 --> 45:44.000]  at infowarstore.com for 40% off.
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  I'm going to keep you at that price until they sell out
[45:46.000 --> 45:48.000]  because of supply chain breakdowns.
[45:48.000 --> 45:49.000]  We've got a limited run.
[45:49.000 --> 45:52.000]  So please take action now and order them
[45:52.000 --> 45:53.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  But whatever you do, find similar products out there
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.000]  and use them because this is a life and death situation
[45:57.000 --> 45:59.000]  to be healthy.
[45:59.000 --> 46:02.000]  It was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film
[46:02.000 --> 46:05.000]  in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[46:05.000 --> 46:08.000]  And in that documentary, I predicted the globalist
[46:08.000 --> 46:11.000]  would establish world government of releasing a virus,
[46:11.000 --> 46:14.000]  demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns
[46:14.000 --> 46:17.000]  and then triggering a collapse of our industrial society.
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  And now they've done it.
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  How did I know they would do it?
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  Because they wrote books and white papers
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.000]  and many of their own reports and internal meetings were leaked.
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  You see, then I was tracking the Bilderberg group
[46:29.000 --> 46:32.000]  who's head at the time was Klaus Schwab.
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  And our sources in cyber confirming to us
[46:34.000 --> 46:37.000]  that they were indeed planning to launch this great research.
[46:37.000 --> 46:39.000]  Well, we're now living in it.
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  The purposeful collapse of the third world and the first world,
[46:42.000 --> 46:45.000]  none attached to the tyrannical corporate world government.
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  Civil censorship, no due process.
[46:47.000 --> 46:49.000]  Destruction of the family.
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.000]  And then incrementally more and more deadly injections
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  of poison mass creating these vaccines
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  to poison us and the populace.
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.000]  This is what Info Wars is fighting.
[46:58.000 --> 47:18.000]  Fighting for the future.
[47:18.000 --> 47:21.000]  Massive demonstrations across the world
[47:21.000 --> 47:24.000]  against the coordinated United Nations Corporate
[47:24.000 --> 47:28.000]  set new world order attack on civilization.
[47:28.000 --> 47:31.000]  And I've got their own admissions from Davos Group last week
[47:31.000 --> 47:35.000]  with the climate lockdowns are coming next.
[47:35.000 --> 47:42.000]  And the design destruction of civilization is accelerating.
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, get ready.
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.000]  Because I'm going to give you some good news.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  Humanity is waking up.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  They're facing the horrors.
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  They're overriding the big tech globalist censors
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.000]  and criminals like Joe Biden are on TV
[48:00.000 --> 48:03.000]  hitting the emergency button two weeks ago,
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.000]  saying censor everyone criticizing the so-called vaccines.
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  Censor anybody criticizing open borders.
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.000]  Shut everyone down.
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.000]  The new German puppet chancellor said the same thing
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.000]  on the same day and so did the day before that.
[48:20.000 --> 48:24.000]  Boris the puppet globalist operative Johnson.
[48:24.000 --> 48:29.000]  And now a supermajority for the first time since World War II
[48:29.000 --> 48:33.000]  in the United Kingdom of the liberals and the conservatives
[48:33.000 --> 48:36.000]  of labor and the Tories.
[48:36.000 --> 48:40.000]  Sat there and tore him up for five hours straight last week
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.000]  and said, we know you're a lying sack of scum.
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  We know this was the consolidate power
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  for the big banks and big box stores.
[48:47.000 --> 48:48.000]  We know you lied.
[48:48.000 --> 48:49.000]  The vaccine doesn't work.
[48:49.000 --> 48:54.000]  And we know you're a damn criminal.
[48:54.000 --> 48:55.000]  Footages everywhere.
[48:55.000 --> 48:56.000]  Don't believe me.
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.000]  Just go look up Boris Johnson destroyed in parliament.
[49:00.000 --> 49:05.000]  A supermajority said we'll end every damn bit of this lockdown
[49:05.000 --> 49:09.000]  and the mask and the vaccine passports and all of it.
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  And the last straw was it turned out behind the scenes.
[49:11.000 --> 49:17.000]  Boris Johnson had intelligence agencies, MI5 and MI6,
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  messing with the members of parliament.
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  You can only intimidate so many people so many time
[49:22.000 --> 49:27.000]  all you cool little people in that super agencies.
[49:27.000 --> 49:32.000]  Like a bunch of NKVD scum in old Russia under the Soviets
[49:32.000 --> 49:37.000]  or a bunch of Stasi under the stinking East German regime
[49:37.000 --> 49:40.000]  or North Korea's police.
[49:40.000 --> 49:44.000]  You're a disgusting disgrace.
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  But the vast majority of people I can tell you in our government
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  actually know what's going on.
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.000]  And I told you this weeks ago I said I have sources
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  at the highest levels and the lowest levels
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  and the lowest levels a lot of times are the best levels
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  that there's a total collapse beyond political realignment
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  in the left.
[50:03.000 --> 50:08.000]  A total collapse in the left.
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.000]  A total collapse.
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  And I don't go there because it's like a communist shrine
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  but my four-year-old daughter likes Trader Joe's for some reason
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  so I took her there today.
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  And I got mobbed by all the liberals.
[50:24.000 --> 50:28.000]  You're right we're sorry oh picture picture everywhere.
[50:28.000 --> 50:31.000]  So I had to like pull my jacket up and hat on
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.000]  and even get out of there.
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  Trader Joe's like a year ago people screaming
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  I was a Russian agent at me.
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  Seriously.
[50:40.000 --> 50:45.000]  The worm is turned folks people get it and I got a stack.
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  Right here showing all of that.
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.000]  Rand Paul comes out and says it's medical malpractice child abuse
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  to give children these shots.
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  They don't protect them they hurt them.
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  Now you're talking buddy boy.
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.000]  Because you damn well knew it before I did.
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  Former chief scientist for Bill Gates.
[51:03.000 --> 51:07.000]  Vaccines are growing new variants inside Vax Bodies Claims Gatesback Doctor.
[51:07.000 --> 51:11.000]  Dr. Gatesback Doctor he headed up a major project for him.
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  Top virologist.
[51:13.000 --> 51:18.000]  Senator Rand Paul it's medical malpractice to force vaccines on children.
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  A catastrophic moral crime.
[51:20.000 --> 51:25.000]  Barry Weiss and Bill Maher say the quiet part out loud.
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  I could air this whole damn show.
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  How the vice.
[51:29.000 --> 51:33.000]  How the massacre fake all the statistics the vaccines don't work.
[51:33.000 --> 51:36.000]  How they block diver Mekton hydroxychloric one and zinc.
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  How their murders how big farm is criminal.
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.000]  I mean this is the rats leaving the sinking ship.
[51:42.000 --> 51:46.000]  With Barry Weiss and Bill Maher.
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.000]  Bill Maher goes further he attacks so to my or a week after we did.
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  She said mass totally work.
[51:52.000 --> 51:55.000]  There's a million you know in the hospital.
[51:55.000 --> 51:59.000]  Hundreds of thousands of children they're all dying none of it true.
[51:59.000 --> 52:02.000]  Destroy her politically.
[52:02.000 --> 52:05.000]  Destroy her non violently destroy the fraud.
[52:05.000 --> 52:08.000]  Stand up to the fraud.
[52:08.000 --> 52:13.000]  I thought a lot of these judges are just judges are either really smart or they're dumber than hell.
[52:13.000 --> 52:16.000]  I just think she's dumber than hell.
[52:16.000 --> 52:20.000]  Look at this because who would go to make a fool of themselves like that.
[52:20.000 --> 52:25.000]  We got 100,000 kids and in ICU we got 4,000 dying a week.
[52:25.000 --> 52:31.000]  No there wasn't 4,000 in all the ICU's in the country with anything you idiot.
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  Excuse me.
[52:33.000 --> 52:40.000]  Science mag in rare cases coronavirus vaccines may cause long COVID like symptoms.
[52:40.000 --> 52:48.000]  Oh my gosh the Journal of Science and all these other big publications are explaining the vaccine gives you long term COVID.
[52:48.000 --> 52:51.000]  Wow.
[52:51.000 --> 52:57.000]  That's just what Dr. Michael Yedon the former chief scientist at Pfizer said six months before any shots began.
[52:57.000 --> 53:04.000]  He signed an emergency lawsuit letter with Dr. Wolfgang Woodard to the EU saying do not do this.
[53:04.000 --> 53:07.000]  It will give you long term COVID.
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.000]  It will eat your ovaries.
[53:08.000 --> 53:09.000]  It will eat your uterus.
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  It will attack your testicles.
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  It will give you cancer.
[53:13.000 --> 53:14.000]  It will give you blood clots.
[53:14.000 --> 53:15.000]  It will give you microcreditus.
[53:15.000 --> 53:19.000]  It will jack you up.
[53:19.000 --> 53:23.000]  And he wasn't the only one that knew that in October of 2020.
[53:23.000 --> 53:34.000]  Three months before the stuff started getting injected here in the US the CDC's own site quietly published a list of what they predicted would happen including everything Yedon said.
[53:34.000 --> 53:41.000]  And now Yedon's crunched the numbers and knows they put deadly death shots for 0.5% of the population.
[53:41.000 --> 53:45.000]  And that's a lot of people that they murdered.
[53:45.000 --> 53:48.000]  I mean those shots were the ones that killed you for sure.
[53:48.000 --> 53:54.000]  It went down in strength to test what was going on.
[53:54.000 --> 53:59.000]  I mean these people got some balls.
[53:59.000 --> 54:04.000]  Science mag in rare cases coronavirus vaccine may cause long COVID like symptoms.
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  Oh yeah it's very rare.
[54:06.000 --> 54:13.000]  That's why I know four people in Austin whose sons died after the shot interviewed them.
[54:13.000 --> 54:39.000]  It's on baby hundreds of thousands marching DC against the poison shots Israel number one in the world for the most vaccinated is the number one in the world for most COVID cases per capita exposed school kids and it goes on.
[54:39.000 --> 54:52.000]  Oh isn't that funny take the most shots got the highest sick rate highest death rate German government concerned about massive anti COVID restrictions protest.
[54:52.000 --> 54:57.000]  And it goes on and on and on.
[54:57.000 --> 55:09.000]  And then I've got Newt Genridge saying the people running the Jan 6 committee in the Justice Department that are doing this witch hunt that makes McCarthy roll over in his grave deserve prison.
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.000]  But what does that do putting these people in prison.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  More criminals just step in to fill their place.
[55:14.000 --> 55:25.000]  How about these people doing this just decide to stop fighting for the new old order when it wants to destroy your future and have a little bit of self preservation for your dumbasses.
[55:25.000 --> 55:34.000]  Here's Senator Paul ladies and gentlemen coming out against the shot for children finally here it is.
[55:34.000 --> 55:50.000]  I believe it's medical malpractice to force vaccines on children particularly adolescent males we now have the scientific evidence that shows the risk of myocarditis for young males is greater for the vaccine than it is for the disease.
[55:50.000 --> 55:55.000]  We also know that the disease the death rate is closer to one in a million.
[55:55.000 --> 55:59.000]  We also know that the more you get the vaccine the higher your risk of myocarditis.
[55:59.000 --> 56:03.000]  So 90% of the myocarditis came with the second vaccine.
[56:03.000 --> 56:06.000]  What do you think it happens when you give them a third vaccine.
[56:06.000 --> 56:13.000]  I think universities like Chicago Princeton Yale that are mandating young males get a third vaccine.
[56:13.000 --> 56:22.000]  I think they're going to be open to liability if any of these boys these young men or women get myocarditis and God forbid dies.
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.000]  And again I apologize the listeners I should have told you this up front.
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  Notice that's a bad quality clip.
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.000]  The clip had millions of views on Twitter and Instagram a few days ago they deleted it everywhere.
[56:32.000 --> 56:42.000]  So we found a jacked up copy and if somebody's got a better one send it to us at showtipsandinfullwars.com but the full thing five minute clip very powerful.
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  It's on infowars.com.
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  It's a big big deal.
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.000]  And again the criminals in big tech that have merged with big pharma.
[56:49.000 --> 56:57.000]  You know Google and Apple and Twitter and all of them particularly Google and Apple heavily invested along with Facebook in the Wuhan lab.
[56:57.000 --> 57:03.000]  And I got all the CIA running it the leftist arm of the CIA all of it next hour.
[57:03.000 --> 57:10.000]  And then I've got Duke Enrits saying the Jan 6th is a criminal operation and we've got the war with Russia the globalists are trying to start.
[57:10.000 --> 57:15.000]  Real facts on that and we've got the latest critical race theory garbage and just so much more.
[57:15.000 --> 57:25.000]  I've hit half of one of my stacks and I've got all these others that are all just as important and I'm going to host some into the third hour of Sunday Night Live and Owen comes in.
[57:25.000 --> 57:32.000]  So we've got life saving incredible groundbreaking information that tyrants everywhere trying to stop.
[57:32.000 --> 57:39.000]  So if you're listening on AM and FM or a TV station or on the internet share the link share the article share the video save lives.
[57:39.000 --> 57:47.000]  If you don't do it they're going to continue to collapse society. That's their plan. Stay with us hour number two straight ahead.
[57:52.000 --> 57:57.000]  Inside you like me fire is burning something needs to change.
[57:57.000 --> 58:02.000]  I just want to reach out and give a recommendation to reset wars. It's really powerful.
[58:02.000 --> 58:07.000]  Reset wars was absolutely amazing and eye-opening and revolutionary.
[58:07.000 --> 58:14.000]  If you want to change your life for the better I highly recommend this to Alex. Thank you very much for putting the course together.
[58:14.000 --> 58:17.000]  I found it to be awesome. It was worth it to me.
[58:17.000 --> 58:24.000]  You have taken ancient wisdom and ancient knowledge and crystallized it with scientific craft.
[58:24.000 --> 58:36.000]  This isn't about Alex Jones. So what you're about to see is a lengthy powerful well documented spectrum of information and experiences and understanding that the power structure
[58:36.000 --> 58:43.000]  is censoring and is definitely afraid to think the way we are intended to think by God. That's what this series is about.
[58:43.000 --> 58:50.000]  Reset wars has been a great tool during this time of uncertainty and it has rejuvenated my hope.
[58:50.000 --> 58:54.000]  It's been helping me a lot with a lot that's going on in my life.
[58:54.000 --> 58:59.000]  Everybody needs to purchase this product and watch it and then share the information far and wide.
[58:59.000 --> 59:05.000]  There is an awakening. Join in to help yourself and others to wake up.
[59:05.000 --> 59:13.000]  Reset wars has been a great tool in both recapping what I've come to already know and also learn new material.
[59:13.000 --> 59:16.000]  I'm not disappointed. I plan on sharing it with as many people as possible.
[59:16.000 --> 59:21.000]  I hear you coming more and more with that and I feel it more and more. It's moving me.
[59:21.000 --> 59:28.000]  We need to have courage and focus in order to accomplish that mission and I felt like I got a lot of that from reset wars as well.
[59:28.000 --> 59:32.000]  The confidence and hope gained from reset wars is priceless.
[59:32.000 --> 59:41.000]  This isn't magic. This is the real code of the universe or what Max Plank 120 plus years ago called The Matrix.
[59:41.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  Start your journey to true freedom now at resetwars.com.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  Well, today's most true meeting in the last two weeks and they hit the panic button and have announced an end to many of their BS restrictions
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  to make people go to sleep and stop demonstrating and stop waking up at the crimes they've committed because they'll push and push and push until they build opposition.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  They know that's so great that it's going to overpower them and overtake them.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  Then they back off hoping we go away.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  Hey, listen, murderers. Listen, you little criminals. You're never going to get away with this.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  You think we're going to let you just launch the next cyberattacks and turn everything off?
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  We're just going to let you so no truckers can drive in the U.S. or over borders unless they've had the shots that illegal aliens can.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  And illegal aliens can drive trucks without the shots.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  You think we don't see through the hospitals all shutting down because you had to fire half your employees in many cases,
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  at least 20% on average or higher because they wouldn't take the poison shot because they saw what it did to people?
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  Don't you get you're not going to get away with it?
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  But I'm not trying to reach out to the psychotic globalists. They're getting off on this.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  They're fully committed. They're going all the way to the wall.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  They had a lot of tricks up their sleeves.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  I want to reach out again to all the fools out there that serve the system that think you're part of this and have been playing games.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  Because I'm seeing major numbers and major issues and major red flags showing that the globalists are in trouble,
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  the check engine light, and that their own people are defecting.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  And that's good. Join humanity.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  Here's a Paul Watson report. I'm going to get more to this later.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  I've got a major message to those serving Satan on the other side. Stay with us.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  And what possible reason could we have to doubt their sincerity?
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  But answering Schwab's question, this was the response from one of the panelists.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  A few years ago, the Edelman survey showed us that the good news is the elite across the world trust each other more and more so we can come together and design and do beautiful things together.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  The bad news is that in every single country they were polling, the majority of people trusted that elite less.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  So we can leave. That's Nairie Woods, Professor of Global Economic Governance at the University of Oxford.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  The comments were actually made at the World Economic Forum's great narrative conference back in November.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  Although the clip you just saw is going viral on Twitter right now.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  The majority of people trusted that elite less.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  Ordinary people not trusting the elite? Oh no, how dreadful. How could that possibly be?
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  Could it have anything to do with the fact that the ultra-rich elite used the pandemic to enact the biggest wealth transfer in history, widening wealth inequality to levels never seen before?
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  As they rate in vast profits while small businesses went bust.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  In the UK alone lockdown pushed 900,000 people into poverty while the rich got 54% richer.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  Could it have anything to do with elitists in countries across the world brazenly flouting the very same lockdown restrictions that they demanded be imposed on everyone else?
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  Creating a new servant class of mask wearing mutes while they parted it up totally maskless.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  Could it have anything to do with the elite buying remote luxury properties? In some cases entire islands.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  To further distance themselves from the general public while we were told we weren't allowed to leave our tiny houses and apartments.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  Could it have anything to do with the elite pressuring big tech to smear, silence and de-platform prominent people who questioned the corona narrative?
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  Could it have anything to do with elitists laboriously lecturing us about our living standards, energy consumption and travel habits?
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  After having arrived to do so on fleets of CO2 spewing private jets, could it have anything to do with those who ask such questions?
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  Being belittled, demonised and treated like trash.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  Also referring to yourselves as the elite.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  Sounds pretty weird.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  The elite.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  Sounds like something a creepy aristocratic bad guy in an old Bond movie would say.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  And maybe, just maybe, that's why people don't trust you.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  It's a big club and you ain't in it.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna go to break, we're gonna come right back and we're gonna hit it hard.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  Stay with us.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp in World War II that when they came for one group, he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up.
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  And then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up.
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  And finally, when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand up.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  Well, the Global Social Credit Score that China is putting in that's banning people the three hours of video games a week and if you criticise the government, you can never buy or sell again.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  Well, that's being brought here and all over the world.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  The guys in COVID vaccine passports, they even invented, now they're saying it's gonna be a carbon tax attached to it.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  They're gonna track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go and what you can do.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  That's what the lockdowns are about.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  You'll accept that, you'll accept anything.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're part of the power structure.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  But they're all gonna be targeted by this nightmare as well.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  It's Sunday, January 23rd, the year is 2022.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  I am your embattled host, very thankful, very humbled that you have commissioned me in this fight.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  You have my commitment to go on to the end, whatever the cost may be, to quote Winston Churchill.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  But all I can promise you is blood, sweat and pain before the victory.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  But I can promise you this, humiliation, death and total enslavement and the annihilation of our species if we don't fight back.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  You can sit there and play whatever games you want, but we're on a planet in space orbiting a sun.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  We have incredible potential and we are under attack, as the Bible told us, by a fallen one with his operatives working through humans to destroy us before we go interstellar.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  And once you understand that, everything makes a lot of sense.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  Human animal clones have been going on for at least 40 years, all public.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  Massive CIA, multinational, deep state, pedophile operations, even in DW.com and New Yorker magazine, decades after I specifically told you what they were doing.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  Because I talked to people that exposed it inside the government before the government was run by the criminals at every level at the top.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  Ted Gunderson and many others.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  These are people that have signed on to the destruction of humanity because they hate humanity and they like it.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  And they are aided by dark spiritual forces.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  That's an ancient way of saying interdimensional forces that are a raid against us.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  But once you're aware of that and call on God to give you aid, God will give you a mission and it doesn't mean your body is invincible, but your spirit will then be invincible.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  You've got to make that decision and the enemy will know it and the enemy will not have power over you as it did before.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  But you will have no hope against this without God, zero.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  All right, let's get into it right now.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  I always say this must be Gregory's best report, but they just get more and more powerful and frightening and they get more and more documenting.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  And again, I was aware of Dr. Yedon, the former chief scientist at Pfizer and these top statisticians were crunching all the VAERS numbers and the UK has their own VAERS and the EU numbers all showing similar numbers,
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  doubling of heart attacks, 20 times increase in certain cancers, massive infertility,
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  multi-thousand percent increase in heart attacks in young people, microcarditis.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  But about five, six months ago, they started honing in, honing in on the issue of why certain lots of the vaccine was being sent to certain areas and not.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  And some would be small lots, some would be giant lots, and so they began to track that.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  And it's 90 plus percent public, but part of it's come out of lawsuits, the documents.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  And you've seen the FDA ordering, you know, via federal order, the release of a lot of documents,
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  that it's very specific that the deadly lots are the ones that they put expiration dates on because it does expire.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  And saline, there's no expiration date. So people will get shipments, the military, Walgreens, you name it, and they go,
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  they don't ask questions, but only select groups are allowed to administer it, and they go,
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  some have asked questions, we've seen pharmacists quit and go public and say this,
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  yeah, we'll get a bunch that says, don't refrigerate, it's the same company, Pfizer, Moderna, you're supposed to refrigerate,
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  and we get a bunch of others from them that says, do refrigerate.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  And we see our patients get really sick with certain lots and not with others.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  So Yedon and other statisticians went in and looked at this, and they conclusively proved that certain lots are placebo
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  and others are mutinogenic and others are a kill shot.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  Now, I've got all this other incredible news, but I just want to impress on you that I'm not risking my life
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  because I think things are hopeless, I believe in you, but we don't want just a million views like it's gotten in a few days
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  at Band-Aid video for Great Reasons Report, we want 50 million.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  I'm not doing this to lose, get it, send it to your whole email list, text message to at least 50 people,
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  print off copies, deliver to the police station, I don't care what you do, call the local talk radio,
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  credit, I don't care, get them off of their butts and get them researching this.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  Do what I did.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  When I saw this Friday, I went and I researched it, and I confirmed it, and then I dug deeper and confirmed it,
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  and I dug deeper and confirmed it, and I found stuff worse than they say in this.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  And I remembered the Japanese eight months ago started testing the Moderna and Pfizer shots
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  and banned different lots and said, yeah, it's weird, one lot's got all this in it,
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  another lot has all this other in it.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  And then the scientists looked at it and said, there's a whole bunch of gene editing in here.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  There's not one mRNA sequence, there's not one order, there's a whole bunch, and it's not an accident.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  They'll look at a whole lot and solve exactly the same thing, it's not like they made mistakes.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  And then a whole other lot, saline, the whole other lot's this, I mean, these people are sick.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  And they sit back with all their computers, wargaming, whatever it is they're doing with this.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  And that's a whole other discussion.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  And it's a cocktail of things, tax fertility, creates cancer, causes mutations, causes double helix,
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  a break in the DNA, the worst type, blood clots, heart attacks, heart swelling.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  I mean, this is just a damn witch's brew.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  Yeah, there it is, Daily Mail, why Japan banned MMR vaccine?
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  I mean, you don't really see that in the national news, though, do you?
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  They banned it.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  Japanese are less than 10% vaccinated, they're not stupid.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  They're not afraid of medicine, they do their research, though.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  You know, they're weirdos, they like to read things, they do their own research.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  Like those New York Times told you, don't do your own research, don't, don't, it's bad.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  Remember the headlines, don't, don't, don't, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  Just go drink a margarito like Saki said.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  And of course, the news said, oh, well, they're banning it because it's contaminated.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  It's not contaminated when it's on purpose.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  If somebody rapes you, they didn't accidentally ejaculate into your body.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  They did it on purpose.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  And that's what this is, is a biological rape of humanity.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  And these scum think it's funny.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  They love it.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  And what do they tell you?
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  All of the little priests from Hollywood and the big tech and all of them,
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  all the different Democrat and leftist scum from Greta Thurmburg
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  to that other child star snot nose Leonardo DiCaprio,
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  that will all be dead in 2030 if we don't do exactly as they say.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  And then they have a document saying we want to depopulate 80 to 90% of what's by 2030,
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  called Agenda 2030.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  And then they have Operation Lockstep.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  And it's their declaration of war on us.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  And then Prince Charles two months ago goes up and gives a speech to the Davos group.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  It says, we are declaring war on humanity with a great military operation to save the earth from the humans.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  This is the greatest military operation ever.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  More funds than exist on the planet to execute this operation against them.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  His father swore to kill you and your family.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  His father said, when I die, I want to come back as a particularly deadly virus
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  to kill 80% of the public in one quote.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  And another magazine he was asked again is in Reuters and the autobond.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  He first told Reuters, they said, can you elaborate two years later?
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  This is back in the 80s.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  And he said, yes, I want to come back as a particularly deadly virus to contribute to overpopulation.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  80% minimum.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  You think these people are playing games?
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  You think Prince Philip just shot his mouth off?
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  When he was raised in Germany under Hitler's command?
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  You think these people are playing games with you?
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  You better grow up, folks, and you better figure out who they are.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  Because if you don't wake up and say no, you deserve to die.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  But what about the children? They don't deserve to die.
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  Everything I just said, you can look up and confirm.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  Oh, you didn't know the Queen of England's husband was a Nazi?
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  You didn't know his cousin? The start of the Bilderberg group was?
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  Prince Bernhardt? Yeah.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  But let's explain this. The Nazis were just a spinoff of this group.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  Not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  And that's done by design.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  The large central banks that basically control the planet
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  will penalize and target any academics that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  the founder of the Bilderberg group, the trilateral commission of the United Nations,
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media, the Bilderberg group, didn't exist.
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  Well, now the Bilderberg group is public in its former head, still on the steering committee,
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  is Klaus Schwab, and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  And if, as a Liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head-on
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  about the fact that they are a worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  We do expose them, we can beat them easily.
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  That's a great sponsor.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high-quality, high-rated satellite phone.

[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  way out in the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work.

[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  What's in are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate.
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  Even in affluent populations like here in America.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at www.infowarsstore.com

[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  once you take them, but that would just be a lie.

[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  Thank you so much.
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for joining us.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  All I can offer you is the truth, nothing more, as Morpheus says in the Matrix.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  All I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  But it's better, I can tell you, than going along blindly under these evil people's controls.
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  I was just thinking during the break how crazy it is that the King of England,
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  he made the King of England, but he had to advocate because he openly worked for Hitler.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  He was German, he was raised in Germany, just like Queen Elizabeth.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  And then he stepped down and then her husband's a Nazi.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  And then we sit here and wonder why they're doing this to us.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  I mean, they're heavily involved in this too.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  And then you've got Prince Charles' younger brother connected to Epstein.
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  I mean, Prince Charles' top lieutenant was Jimmy Savelle,
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  a Satanist pedophile that raped and murdered children on record in a sex dungeon.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  And maybe you think, if you're a TV viewer, you're looking at an image from The Hunger,
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  that vampire movie that's pretty well done back in the 1980s.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  And no, that's really him.
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  And if he looks like a vampire, maybe it's because of the main bloodline of Count Dracula,
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  who is not a literal vampire, but is the spirit of Satan in Bran Stoker's Dracula,
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  which is a fictional account of the spiritual nature of this family.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  Now, that's all mainline history, by the way.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  The average person doesn't know what PhD history, people know that.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  But that's the evil we're dealing with.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  So if you wonder why they're trying to corrupt your DNA, why they're trying to kill you,
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  why they're trying to attack you, all they're doing this is because they're demons from hell.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  And Jeffrey Epstein worked for them as a butler, just like Jimmy Savelle did.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  I don't want to go off on a jag about them. I want to get to the mind control.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  Here is a mass formation psychosis Karen at the big anti-mandates police state rally,
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  anti-police state rally, with hundreds of thousands, if not half a million,
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  they're saying, in DC today, resist the mandates event.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  And here she is screaming and yelling, calling him white supremacist,
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  and saying they're going to kill her because they won't take the shots.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  Funny, if you've had the shot, I thought you're protected.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  Oh, no, you're killing her. She loves big pharma. She's hysterical. Here it is.
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  The sellers are going to pay for the police to shut down the road so that these white supremacists
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  can party and have a hell of a time celebrating their loser president.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  Loser Trump, go the f**k home. Stop invading our territory.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  Go the f**k home. Take your loser president and shove him up your ass.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  The richest and powerful city in the world sucking off America,
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  Washington, DC, with the liberal communists go, it's our territory.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  If you're a TV viewer, here's the sickening footage of a little girl that would kill a baby, of course,
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  trying to put a big, thick, basically pillow over its face.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  This isn't Godfather 2 with her murdering Hyman Roth with a pillow.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  This is the psychotic, behavioral psychologist breaking the social contract with the public
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  and literally teaching children they're dirty and they're evil,
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  that they've got to wear filthy muzzles over their faces like this that's sold in stores in Austin,
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  little buddies. And it's a big, thick face diaper.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  On the back says, don't wear it if you can't breathe and don't sleep in it, it could kill you.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  Oh, little buddies, little muzzles.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  You're a prisoner now. Keep your dirty mouth shut.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  This is the dystopia they offer.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  Why would anyone want to go along with this?
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  Now, this clip you're about to see is from Rand Paul on Fox News.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  They are pulling this everywhere. This scares the hell out of them because I told you he's the next domino to fall.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  He's a medical doctor. He knows it isn't a vaccine. He knows it doesn't work now.
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  He knows he got conned. He knows it's causing heart attacks. He knows it's killing kids.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  And he's coming out saying it's medical malpractice to go after young people with this vaccine.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  This is a bellwether event. Here is the censored clip.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  Further, undermine parents, the first bill out of the California newly formed vaccine caucus
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  would allow children 12 and older to receive vaccinations without their parents' consent.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  Senator, we know they've wanted to put a wedge between children and their parents for a long time on a lot of issues,
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  but this kind of takes the cake.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  I believe it's medical malpractice to force vaccines on children, particularly adolescent males.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  We now have the scientific evidence that shows the risk of myocarditis for young males
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  is greater for the vaccine than it is for the disease.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  We also know that the disease, the death rate, is closer to one in a million.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  We also know that the more you get the vaccine, the higher your risk of myocarditis.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  So 90% of the myocarditis came with the second vaccine.
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  What do you think it happens when you give them a third vaccine?
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  I think universities like Chicago, Princeton, Yale, that are mandating young males get a third vaccine.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  I think they're going to be open to liability if any of these boys, these young men or women get myocarditis
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  and, God forbid, dies.
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  They're going to be open to liability because they're going against the science,
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  or you have such left-wing academics who's header in the sand and just think,
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  oh, Dr. Fauci wants us to do it, we should do it.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  They're not thinking about this, but they're going to be open to big-time liability for forcing this vaccine on kids.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  Now, if you go back two years ago, I laid out how they would say you need multiple boosters,
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  how it wouldn't work, how it would hurt a bunch of people,
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  and then when it did, the people that gave it to their kids, the left, always deny they've done wrong,
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  never admit when they're wrong.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  I'm wrong all the time, I admit it, and want to change.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  And so they're doubling down, defending it.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  Do you think that Karen that thinks a diverse crowd with Robert Kennedy Jr.,
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  a half million people they're now saying, do you think they're really white supremacists?
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  No lady, they're not white supremacists.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  People that love freedom and medical freedom in a sovereign nation are not bad
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  because they're not with the ruling class and big farming, you idiot.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  But do you think she'll listen as all the information comes out?
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  No, she'll triple down to the end of the world because she's the hero and you're Hitler,
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  even though literally the people that created Hitler are running this.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  Let's hear from her again.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  And let me give this lady a little tip here.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  Probably 70% of that crowd's liberals that are actually real liberals
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  and don't have a death wish, you moron.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  And a little other tip, when you stomp your feet, when you speak, that's what babies do.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  That shows you're an infantile moron.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[1:30:47.000 --> 1:31:15.000]  That's 833-470-0438 for Info Wars.

[1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:23.000]  and then defend your body with your immune system against outside attackers.
[1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:26.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, multivitamins are the way to go.
[1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:28.000]  So many of them are synthetic.
[1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:33.000]  Our multivitamin whole food system is one of the best quality multivitamin systems you're going to find.
[1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  But regardless of whether you get it from us or somebody else,

[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  especially old folks, children, everybody needs it, but especially old folks.
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:47.000]  Also, we have vitamin C and zinc with rose hips.
[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  It's also back in stock.
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:51.000]  It's at 40% off.
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  Both these are available at InfoWarsHore.com and BrainForce Plus is back in stock as well at 40% off.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:03.000]  Well, I'm very excited for several reasons that two of our very popular products are back in stock.
[1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  Whole food multivitamin, essential nutrient multivitamin from natural healthy sources,
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  not synthetic, and vitamin C and zinc with rose hips, the classic Linus Pauling Nobel Prize winning,
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  formula to supercharge your immune system and every cell in your body.
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  They're both back in stock, sold out for more than four months at 40% off.
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  Another reason I'm very, very excited about this is this will fund our operation and keep us on air.
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  So again, it's a 360 win, but whatever you do, go out and get an organic whole food multivitamin,
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  and take vitamin C and take zinc.
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  We also have some great vitamin D products at InfoWarsHore.com as well.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  But whatever you do, defend your body's immune system.
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  We want to keep patriots in the game against the new world order.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  So it's a 360 win.
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  It's something essential for your body and your health and your longevity and your immune system
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:33:09.000]  while funding the InfoWarsHore.com.
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:31.000]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  The globalists are seeing their little reshed and going as well as they thought.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  The tyrants always think they got it all figured out.
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  They always think they're invincible.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  But most of the time, they end up getting attacked by the tail.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  So let's lay it out.
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  I remember when they stole the election from Trump and it was his clearest day and we had all the evidence
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  and judges would hear it because there were a bunch of cowards.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  And then it got where it was supposed to be heard in the U.S. Senate where four years before,
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  Pelosi done the same maneuvers to try to have an investigation and block Trump's win.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  But then it was illegitimate.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  This was legitimate.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  But even if Trump was wrong, you have a constitutional right to do this and that's what was happening.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  That was what was going on.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  Their idea that you can't challenge elections and it's some type of terrorism is pure garbage.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  But now see what's happened.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  Yeah, they're shredding the dollar and they got the borders open.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  But America is waking up more than ever.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  The world's waking up and even the Democratic Party is now throwing Biden completely, absolutely under the bus
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  because they want to move on to whoever it is they're planning.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  Big Mike, Michelle Obama, whoever to run coming up in two and a half years.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  But they'll announce within a year or so right after the midterm.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  So, careful what you wish for.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  If we'd had a violent revolution and tried to keep Trump in, they could have had a civil war.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  They would have probably won and then they would install somebody like Biden basically forever.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  Violence is not the answer.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  Understanding and awakening is the answer.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  And I said that before January 6th and I said it after January 6th.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  And I said they're not going to have a coup.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  Governor Newsom hasn't been executed and isn't it gone?
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  This is all deep state through HNN, through these systems on record,
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  trying to get idiots to go to DC and have a shooting war so they could really expand the police state takeover
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  that they wanted January 6th to be, but it didn't go as bad as they wanted it to with their provocateurs.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  And it's come out they had over a thousand armed feds there and stood down.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  It's come out they refused Trump the National Guard.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  It's turned out all that and they don't want that to be discussed, but it is being discussed.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  So good luck trying to frame me for it or Owen Schreuer or another member or a crew they've arrested.
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  Because the American people know the truth about what's going on.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  Now even Newt Genrich has gone on television, on Fox News and said that in the end it's basically going to be the Democrats that should worry about jail time.
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  I don't even care about putting Democrats in jail. They're puppets.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  I want people in the political system to stop being suicidal, ladies and gentlemen, to stop going along with the globalists, to stop being part of this.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  We're going to play it in a moment.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  And it's a very, very important video from the GatewayPunet.com has posted.
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  After a year of Biden's shocking number of Americans think country is on the wrong track and that's skewed national polls that pull on average 15% more Democrats.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  NBC's Chuck Todd, Biden no longer seen as competent and effective.
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  CNN demolishes Biden in brutally honest assessment.
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  But that's because he was always put in to then fall apart and take the blame for their agenda crashing America.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  So they can give us another Democrat savior.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  We've got to transcend Biden and realize he's a puppet.
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  Wayne Roots written a key editorial.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  It's also up on Infowars.com. It's also at GatewayPunet.com.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  We are in a civil war. It's a war of good versus evil.
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  And Democrats are the Confederate South.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  Newt Gendrich's lawless Democrats face real risk of jail for laws they are breaking when GOP takes over.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  I'm going to play that in a moment.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  But first, I'm not going to play the clips. We're out of time here soon.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  But Saki came out and said that she works for Obama and that build back better so as Pelosi is Obama.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  Because it's true, Obama is still running things.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  Obama is in his third term. Expose that. This is all illegitimate.
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  Oh, look, no jail time for leopard print clad man who scaled Capitol on January 6.
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  His mom blamed Rush Limbaugh, really?
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  And Alex Jones for fueling his anger issues.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  Yeah, nothing the Democrats do is a problem.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  Not burning down all those different cities and stuff.
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  Mostly peaceful protest.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  Here's another article now confirmed that Trump authorized National Garbit was blocked.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  And it just goes on from there, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  And I saw this video that I'm going to air next hour.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  That I and others shot a bunch of these on top the roof during the so-called insurrection.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  As a million people are milling around up and down the road, Pennsylvania Avenue,
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  a tiny fraction went in the Capitol and they're all blamed as terrorists.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  And the FBI has visited more than 10,000 people and arrested some that were just there.
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  So that footage is coming up. I'm going to host part of Sunday Live in the next hour.
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  And I'll be getting to all of that and some more of the delusional Q stuff.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  And again, I'm not attacking people that might have gotten sucked in by the Q thing.
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  I'm begging you to have common sense.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  And I'm begging you to realize that that is a PSYOP modeled off the Russian Bolshevik plan
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  to find out who their opposition was and trick their opposition into committing crimes
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  so they could arrest them in Operation Trust.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  And the saying was, trust the plan as we one go, we all go.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  As one goes, we all go.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  And when I read that in the Russian a few years ago, I couldn't believe I'd missed it.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  That they're literally Bolshevik 2.0 run by big banks, just like the attack on the Russians was,
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  is literally running Operation Trust today through Q.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  And they're trying to reconstitute Q camps run by the Southern Provincial Law Center
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  and others under the washful eye of leftist arms of the Justice Department
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  to cook up new forces to launch new attacks, just like Elohim City and Oklahoma City.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  And that's what the Attorney General was the overseer of in 1995.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  He was the head of that project.
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  That's why he's the Attorney General now because their only hope is to provocateur or stage events
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  to have a civil war to blame the American people and to try to discredit the election.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  And that's what Biden's saying is we're not going to have a legitimate election if Republicans win.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  We've got to federalize it now and Republicans are about to blow stuff up.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  No, we're not.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  We're nationalists.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  We're populist.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  I'm not even a Republican.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  I just want to use their party to take the country back.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  The last thing we want strategically is violence.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  Don't you dare say that.
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  Don't you dare push that.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  Don't you dare.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  You're not going to get away with it.
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  We're watching everything you do.
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  And so we're good people in law enforcement and good people in the Justice Department.
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  Here's what Newt Gingrich had to say about it.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  Welcome back.
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  I am back with former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  Newt, you were at with an op-ed recently titled The Wolves Will Become Sheep.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  Walk us through that op-ed and what's taking place right now in Washington.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  Sure.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  Well, you have both with Attorney General Garland and with this select committee on January 6th.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  People who've run amok.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  They are breaking the rules.
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  They are going after people in a way which is reminiscent of the British monarchy using closed-door systems that we outlawed deliberately because we'd seen it.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  We knew what it was like.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  And they're running over people's civil liberties.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  And what they need to understand is on January 4th next year, you're going to have a Republican majority in the House and a Republican majority in the Senate.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  And all these people who've been so tough and so mean and so nasty are going to be delivered subpoenas for every document, every conversation, every tweet, every email.
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  Because I think it's clear that these are people who are literally just running over the law, pursuing innocent people, causing them to spend thousands and thousands of dollars in legal fees for no justification.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  And it's basically a lynch mob and unfortunately the Attorney General in the United States has joined that lynch mob and is totally misusing the FBI.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  And I think when you have a Republican Congress, this is all going to come crashing down and the wolves are going to find out that they're now sheep.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  And they're the ones who are in fact going to, I think, face a real risk of jail for the kind of laws they're breaking.
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  Well, this is such great analysis. Meanwhile, you see more Americans leaning to the right in the face of all of these policies.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  Well, look, the Democrats are losing on two fronts. They're losing on a reality front. I mean, every time you go to buy gasoline, you're reminded they're incompetent.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  And they're losing on a policy front. People don't want a socialist left-wing radical America.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  So they have a two-front fight. They're going to lose both fronts. And I think it's going to lead to one of the largest tsunamis in American history as they get thrown out.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  All right, Newt, it's great to catch up with you. Please come back soon.
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  But they're going to stage terror attacks to blame us. They're going to do that. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at m4store.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  And I've tested this and I've taken your B12 and let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price. I really do.
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  I take that B12 and I'm electric, man. I can run 10 miles. I do some pretty heavy work with a highway department.
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  And my friends will attest to the fact that, yeah, for a guy in his 60s, you know, pushing 70, and I'm not just blowing smoke here. The B12 saves my life.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:01.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome.
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  Hello, Alex.
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  Yes, Malcolm.
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  All right. I'll make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  Uh, Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer.
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  Supermell Vitality and Brain Force Plus. Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable tank.
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  Supermell Vitality really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions. It also worked quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  This is like a very fine wine. It's, in fact, each batch is different.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay. People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  That's just how it is. It's how it works. Uh, so it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed,
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset.
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:29.000]  because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda.
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  We've also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:42.000]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  Because believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  All right, final segment of the regular Alex Jones Sunday edition, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  But I am going to be hosting part of with Owen Sunday Live, 6 to 8 p.m.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  We started that about a year ago now and it only has six minutes of ads an hour for local stations.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  We don't have any network breaks. A lot of stations are picking it up.
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  I have the huge Russia War News. What's really going on behind that I'm going to start off with.
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  Also the designed collapse for infrastructure and energy sector with more blackouts now being confirmed and food shortages.
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  You need to know what's going on. That's coming up at the start of the next hour.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  I'll host 30 minutes and then Owen Shroy is going to take over.
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  Now, what we know about the COVID police state rollout globally is that if we have speech, we can defeat these hysterias they create.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  But that's why down to the grade school level across the Western world, they are teaching children that speech is evil, that speech is bad.
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  Here's some very important headlines right here. This is just today.
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  University of Washington's inclusive language guide.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  What a nice way for saying sensor system says grandfather housekeeping are problematic.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  See all basic language is evil.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  University puts trigger warning in the UK on Orwell's novel before over explicit material.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  Trying to restrict it from the students. I mean, this is 1984.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  And that leads us to liberal radio host Jimmy door born censorship of Alex Jones was just the beginning.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  The full 10 minute report is up on info wars.com.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  We won't have time to air it all here, but I'll add it in post when this is re uploaded to the full show tonight.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  Put on screen for me, please. The Rolling Stone article that he talks about because they've gone and removed this photo now from the Rolling Stone article.
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  And I remember one day last August when this came out, Joe Rogan texted to me and he said, if you've seen this BS.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  And I said, no, and I said, wow, so they're seeing thousands of people are being turned away with gunshot wounds in Oklahoma, even though they don't get thousands of gunshot wounds hardly a year.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  And it's in August, but they're wearing coats. Scroll down and show the full photo.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  And they're wearing coats and none of them have gunshot wounds. And it's a photo. It turns out from somewhere totally different before the year before.
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, this is the level of deception that we're dealing with.
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  Because I remember calling Joe, I go, what do you mean? He goes, we don't you see it? It's August, but they're wearing coats.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  And there don't have any gunshot wounds because obviously it's fake. And I go, yeah.
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  And Christie Lee got in her car and she got on the phone and she, you know, got Oklahoma hospitals to say no one had gotten sick and no one had died.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  And it was all fake. And there were no lines and there weren't people being turned away with gunshot wounds.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  And we forced them to do that. And unless it's name dropping Joe Rogan, the point is, is that I would look at that photo and not even think, why is it a lie?
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  Joe's even going deeper now off. Look, there don't have gunshot wounds. That's not lines of ambulances.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  Why are they wearing coats in August? This is how stupid they think we are.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  And they took that photo off their original article that they had to then correct.
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  But that's how these people operate, folks. And the level of lies is just so easy to even see.
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  So here's Jimmy Dore laying out just some of what's happened.
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  He's in the news every day. He has the most popular show in America. He gets 11 million views per episode.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  There's no show comes close to that, right? That's like, that's like going back to 1974 and all in the family kind of numbers when there was only three TV stations.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  So, and now everybody's up in arms because Joe Rogan offers an alternative to the big pharma funded narrative around COVID.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  And so the big pharma funded news outlets are freaking out. Well, they tried to smear them before, right?
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  So CNN lied about COVID. They lied about ivermectin. And Joe Rogan had Sanjay Gupta on the show face to face.
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  And Sanjay Gupta had to admit that CNN was lying and Joe Rogan was correct about ivermectin.
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  Gupta tells Joe Rogan CNN shouldn't have called ivermectin horse to whirmer.
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  People still do that, like it's funny or something or clever. It's not. It's the opposite of both those things.
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  You're repeating a lie, which is, but was made up by big pharma.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  Did you do a PSA?
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  Yeah, so nobody, no, what kind, what?
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  They should have a PSA. It teaches you how to say no to ivermectin from your doctor when he wants to give it to you.
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  Hey, I think, wait, hey, no way, doc. That's horse to whirmer. Say no, then go.
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  So Joe Rogan, they won't know. So Joe Rogan, when he gets a doctor from CNN on, he schools the doctor, not the other way around.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  And now every, this is the new thing. Doctors call out Spotify over Joe Rogan spreading false and societal harmful COVID-19 claims.
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  The Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform.
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  The company present presently has no misinformation policy.
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  They want him to put a mask on Joe Rogan, Spotify, cover Joe Rogan with a mask.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  Joe Rogan does a comedy podcast. Joe Rogan is literally a comedian who announces guys fighting in cages and he does a podcast.
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  And now they want to censor it. Do you see how far we've come from Alex Jones?
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  Do you see how far they went from Alex Jones to the president of the United States to a Kennedy? And now they're going to the number one show in America.
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  It's just Alex Jones and then everyone and anyone else who steps out of line.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  And by the way, so they say 250 doctors. Well, 16,000 physicians challenged the 300 who currently accused Joe Rogan and others of spreading misinformation.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  And this big thing of 250 doctors reminds me that there was 100 authors were against Einstein when he came out with the theory of relativity.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  That's so this isn't that doesn't mean anything. Why did they hate science? Why? Why did they why did why did Einstein hate science so much?
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  So this is the real reason all this is happening. Joe Rogan is getting 11 million views per episode. CNN primetime doesn't even get a million.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  He's not 100% bigger than them. He's not 200% bigger three, four. He's 1100% bigger than over over.
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  And by the way, his his podcast with Dr. Robert Malone who they tried to censor got 40 million downloads or views 40 million.
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  So this censoring thing isn't working. It's doing the Streisand effect. Why? Because people trust Joe Rogan.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  They don't trust. They don't trust establishment news. They trust Joe Rogan and they should and they should distrust this news because this news is all bought and paid for.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  I love this beam. Look at me. I am the mainstream now. Yes, he is. What is the definition of mainstream?
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  It's just like somebody trying to tell me Donald Trump is.
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  He makes a lot of other good points. The full interview or the full little 10 minute segment is at info wars.com.
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  Why is this important? Well, we were getting conservatively in 2016, 20 million viewers a day as big as Limbaugh ever got.
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  So we finally matched Limbaugh, which is not my goal in life, but that's a big deal.
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  And then on election week, we had 87 million IP addresses hit us and we had 30 something million people on election night come in and the system saw that and they said, OK, OK, it's over.
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  We'll get rid of him. But they were admitting later in the Wall Street Journal that the plan was to get Alex Jones and Julian Assange.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  And once the left put up with Assange going down and the right put up with Alex Jones going down, they would destroy everybody's free speech.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  Remember the old nursery rhyme? Jack Spratt could eat no fat and his wife could eat no lean.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  So between the two, they lick the platter clean.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  And now they want Joe Rogan, but it doesn't matter. They'll take Joe Rogan off the air.
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  I don't think they'll be able to and there'll be 10 more that just get that big because people don't want to watch Brian Stelter.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  They don't want to watch Chuck Todd on NBC. They don't want to watch Joe Biden. They don't want to watch Jen Psaki.
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  They don't want to watch Angela Merkel. We don't like Barack Obama. We don't like Jeffrey Epstein.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  We don't like Queen Elizabeth. We don't like Tom Hanks. We don't like Brad Pitt.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  We don't like you. We hate you.
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  Hollywood is dead. The Democratic Party is dead. And they want to take us with them.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  And all I'm asking the people in government and corporations and everywhere is just stop kissing the New World Order's ass.
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  Because there's always a new level. They always move the goalpost. How much you got to serve these people?
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  And now they're going to stage terror attacks and try to have a civil war. So I'm letting everybody know.
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  I'm not part of this. I'm not going to get in the middle of this with a dying corrupt empire.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  I want a pro-human future. But pray for peace, folks, and get the word out and share these articles and videos.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  Because Info Wars is the tip of the spear and the trailblazing operation put here by you. And God's will.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  So thank you. InfoWarsStore.com. Forgot to plug in. If you don't find us, we won't be here.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  Supposing we got great products. All right. Sunday Live coming up. If your Stasis don't care, you can find it at infowars.com.
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  If you're like me, you've been a long time listener of this program. You fed up with everything going on in the world.
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  Inside you, like me, a fire is burning. Something needs to change. And yet, we feel helpless.
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  Almost like we're stuck inside a system that someone else created for us.
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:07.000]  It's time for us to break free from that system.
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  Reset Wars is a game changer. You start to see yourself more as part of the solution instead of just as a victim.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  So much of the stuff we look at today is low vibration, low energy, and makes us depressed.
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  And therefore, we manifest this negative reality out there.
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  When they feel their lie-cheat-steal plan to enslave and rob the people, there is an awakening.
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  Reset Wars has helped me to navigate and to pinpoint and lock onto the deep-rooted psychological tactics that were being used against me.
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  And now I'm not scared anymore.
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:45.000]  I have to say, I was blown away. I feel so much better every day listening to it.
[1:58:45.000 --> 1:58:49.000]  To Alex, thank you very much for putting the course together. You're absolutely right.
[1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:57.000]  We are reflections of God. We are emanations of that. And we can use that God energy to do really anything we want to do in this life.
[1:58:57.000 --> 1:59:02.000]  Romans chapter 12, Paul talks about how we're transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:06.000]  And that's a process. Most of our thoughts and actions are subconscious.
[1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  Most people go through their day and don't think about many things. You can drive along a long journey and not even remember half the trip.
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  In this process, we need to have a concerted, active effort, physically and mentally, to reprogram that subconscious mind.
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  That's what this series is about, is resetting our mind, because there's a war on for our mind.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:31.000]  He's exactly right. And he's become a great voice in our generation and in this new great awakening.
[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:58.000]  And I encourage everybody out there, if you haven't gone there yet, go to resetwars.com. That's where your journey begins.
