[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.440 --> 00:19.000]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.000 --> 00:27.040]  Texas Alex Jones it's had to be almost three and a half four years tomorrow I
[00:27.040 --> 00:35.320]  think about it since I've had a stomach bug this was a really weird one I got
[00:35.320 --> 00:40.480]  sick briefly Wednesday and it went away that day then it came back with a
[00:40.480 --> 00:46.440]  vengeance on Saturday and my wife had called the doctor because my children
[00:46.440 --> 00:49.440]  have been sick as well and so had she earlier in the week and they said yeah
[00:49.440 --> 00:54.160]  whatever this stomach bug is it hits you one day and then three or four days
[00:54.160 --> 01:01.600]  later comes back I am still somewhat under the weather but I'm 90% better
[01:01.600 --> 01:06.720]  from yesterday and so I am here with you live and I appreciate you for joining
[01:06.720 --> 01:10.760]  us I just wanted to upfront let folks know that I am a bit under the weather
[01:10.760 --> 01:16.320]  if it sounds like I'm somewhat inebriated I'm speaking a little bit
[01:16.320 --> 01:24.360]  slower and a bit dingy I've been already calling the crew by names that don't
[01:24.360 --> 01:31.680]  exist in this office but I should warm up here in the first hour a bit and get
[01:31.680 --> 01:40.080]  rolling now I came in today because the news is obviously of great import of
[01:40.080 --> 01:48.200]  extreme importance and we're gonna be breaking it all down huge developments
[01:48.200 --> 01:55.840]  in the Middle East and North Africa we also have the British government
[01:55.840 --> 02:00.400]  announcing that you're not gonna have power most of the time in England this
[02:00.400 --> 02:06.680]  is the post-industrial world they're openly saying for the earth and to stop
[02:06.680 --> 02:10.640]  humans from destroying the earth with carbon dioxide that they're gonna be
[02:10.640 --> 02:16.280]  cutting your power off same thing is coming here the United States that has
[02:16.280 --> 02:22.640]  all been planned and laid out also AFP is reporting the government fair
[02:22.640 --> 02:30.240]  mongering world six mass extinction may be underway study finds they're saying
[02:30.240 --> 02:34.760]  that the extinction of mankind has now begun this is a prestigious journal
[02:34.760 --> 02:39.720]  putting this out so they're they're creating the self-fulfilling prophecy
[02:39.720 --> 02:44.480]  that we're all basically going to be dying very very soon so that as the
[02:44.480 --> 02:49.720]  globalists carry out these controlled plagues people will see it as a self
[02:49.720 --> 02:55.840]  fulfilling prophecy or a foregone conclusion and will accept it and won't
[02:55.840 --> 03:04.600]  do more research on why this indeed is happening now in some of the other news
[03:04.600 --> 03:10.720]  on the economic front number of healthcare reform laws waivers climb
[03:10.720 --> 03:19.000]  above 1,000 we're gonna be going over that today the essence of tyranny where
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.880]  the insiders get waivers everybody else doesn't unfair trade advantage also I
[03:24.880 --> 03:30.720]  I heard the clip on news radio this morning we haven't been able to find it
[03:30.720 --> 03:35.680]  but I do have the text of it it was very Orwellian and on the newscast they
[03:35.680 --> 03:40.760]  didn't even point it out senator John Kerry said I'm against any military
[03:40.760 --> 03:46.240]  action that's why I only want to bomb their airfields in Libya and have a no
[03:46.240 --> 03:55.720]  fly zone so they just practice up as down down as black as white white as
[03:55.720 --> 04:09.200]  black they just practice all of this now in everyone's face where they just
[04:09.200 --> 04:16.240]  throw it all out there oh we all agree there shouldn't be military action in
[04:16.240 --> 04:23.920]  Libya but we need to go ahead and bomb their airfields have a no fly zone
[04:23.920 --> 04:32.080]  because that's not a military action that's what Kerry said McCain said he
[04:32.080 --> 04:36.200]  agreed with him that we didn't need military action we need to just bomb
[04:36.200 --> 04:44.800]  them I mean they just are really trying to set the precedent to get away with
[04:44.800 --> 04:48.760]  anything they want we're gonna go over all of this on the other side of this

[09:58.760 --> 10:02.600]  already feel my brain awakening ladies and gentlemen

[10:06.920 --> 10:15.160]  thank you for joining us but um my wife is like why are you getting out of bed
[10:15.160 --> 10:18.840]  why are you coming down there to do the show
[10:18.840 --> 10:24.520]  uh and uh you know i'm blessed i haven't been sick in three four years
[10:24.520 --> 10:29.000]  other than like allergies and stuff but uh some people never get sick
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.080]  i wish i was like them because well you know that feeling after you've really
[10:33.080 --> 10:37.400]  been sick your brain feels swollen and your eyes feel
[10:37.400 --> 10:42.040]  kind of crossed and you uh you have trouble focusing
[10:42.040 --> 10:46.200]  well that's how i am right now so this should be an interesting
[10:46.200 --> 10:51.320]  interesting three hours here today an experiment in broadcasting but i can i
[10:51.320 --> 10:55.320]  can feel the blood flowing through my brain i can feel
[10:55.320 --> 10:59.240]  i can feel the awakening happening you know what happened is
[10:59.240 --> 11:04.920]  yesterday in bed surfing around on my ipad
[11:04.920 --> 11:09.000]  i was reading all this news and burning with desire
[11:09.000 --> 11:12.600]  to get in here today into the show that's why i ended up calling in while paul
[11:12.600 --> 11:16.840]  watson was filling in uh last night to talk about some
[11:16.840 --> 11:20.920]  important issues and then this morning i got up and saw the news and i said i've
[11:20.920 --> 11:24.920]  got to come in this is all just too important and it
[11:24.920 --> 11:27.960]  certainly is important
[11:27.960 --> 11:32.360]  so i'm going to be going over all of this news here in just a moment
[11:32.360 --> 11:37.160]  uh we are going to open the phones up today i am going to lean on the callers
[11:37.160 --> 11:39.800]  as they say so please have your question
[11:39.800 --> 11:45.960]  your comment ready and who knows one of the few times i've actually been able
[11:45.960 --> 11:49.400]  to take a hundred phone calls or so is when i have been under the weather
[11:49.400 --> 11:55.000]  because then my brain isn't burning uh with understanding and obnoxiousness
[11:55.000 --> 11:58.440]  where it's bouncing around like a wild pinball
[11:58.440 --> 12:02.120]  uh it's it's it's it's more relaxed and so i can
[12:02.120 --> 12:06.360]  actually answer your questions quietly and succinctly and quickly
[12:06.360 --> 12:10.360]  and get more of you on air the toll-free number to join us is
[12:10.360 --> 12:25.240]  1-800-259-9231-800-259-9231 and we will get you up and on the air
[12:26.440 --> 12:35.080]  1-800-259-9231 man i am slurring my words here maybe i shouldn't be on air
[12:35.080 --> 12:45.160]  today oh man i felt a lot better before i got
[12:45.160 --> 12:51.960]  on air hmm hold on just a minute
[12:51.960 --> 12:57.800]  waking up here waking up another big problem with this is is i'm so accustomed
[12:57.800 --> 13:00.360]  to my own show i'll guarantee you that if i was in
[13:00.360 --> 13:05.000]  studio with somebody else i'd be more awake even though i'm sick
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.640]  um but we're gonna we're gonna get the job done
[13:09.640 --> 13:14.520]  today here ladies and gentlemen it's also kind of daunting looking at all
[13:14.520 --> 13:18.840]  this news it makes it more daunting than normal
[13:18.840 --> 13:25.640]  than usual here because it it makes me realize how exhausting it is
[13:25.640 --> 13:30.120]  to research this information to have a deep understanding of it
[13:30.120 --> 13:34.120]  and then to come back on air and cover it after i've already researched it
[13:34.120 --> 13:38.520]  and to know that i just can't do justice verbally
[13:38.520 --> 13:46.680]  audibly semantically to what the mind can behold and understand
[13:47.960 --> 13:58.680]  and i've many times used the analogy of it's like trying to describe to someone
[13:58.680 --> 14:07.480]  what a rocky mountain vista looks like at sunrise or sunset or what
[14:09.000 --> 14:14.360]  what it's like to be scuba diving 50 feet down in crystal clear water
[14:14.360 --> 14:20.040]  on the side of a reef it's you can't really verbally describe it very well
[14:20.040 --> 14:26.360]  you one has to see it to experience it and it's the same for these
[14:26.360 --> 14:31.880]  bad things that we cover and the terrible things that we cover
[14:31.880 --> 14:37.320]  words really can't describe how important it is
[14:37.320 --> 14:41.800]  oh i i i do want to say one thing please when i open the phones up don't tell
[14:41.800 --> 14:45.800]  me get better or here's a hot toddy for you or here's a
[14:45.800 --> 14:48.760]  you know here's here's something to make you get better
[14:48.760 --> 14:53.240]  um i shouldn't have even probably been on air today
[14:53.240 --> 14:57.960]  but i'm here and i'm going to do it and uh but please please don't do that
[15:00.200 --> 15:04.680]  because you know that uh it's all pointless now anyways
[15:06.840 --> 15:13.560]  okay let me uh just just just mention the stacks of news i have uh here in front of me
[15:15.880 --> 15:23.080]  we're all north koreans now era of constant electricity at home is ending
[15:23.080 --> 15:28.120]  says uk power chief and then i have right here and we'll show you this on screen
[15:31.160 --> 15:38.280]  i have right here the actual news article era of constant electricity at home is ending
[15:38.920 --> 15:44.600]  says power chief and this is out of the daily telegraph and it says the days of permanently
[15:44.600 --> 15:50.200]  available electricity have been coming to an end the head of the power network said yesterday
[15:50.200 --> 15:57.400]  and they said to tackle climate change uh within the next 10 years uh you're not
[15:57.400 --> 16:02.040]  going to be able to have power whenever you want it on a routine basis you'll only have
[16:02.040 --> 16:08.280]  power on the government wants you to but of course you'll end up then still paying more for power
[16:09.400 --> 16:14.600]  it's what the u n is called for it's what the head of the nasa climatology department at
[16:14.600 --> 16:20.600]  goddard is called for it's a post industrial world more strong all of them see it's all about control
[16:22.280 --> 16:28.120]  it's all about shutting society down it's called feudalism and here's another big report i'm going
[16:28.120 --> 16:36.600]  to get into world's six mass extinction maybe underway study says uh due to climate change
[16:36.600 --> 16:41.800]  so we're we're going to be extinct soon humans are due to climate change which has been proven
[16:41.800 --> 16:46.200]  to be a complete fraud meanwhile they don't debate any of the real threats to humanity
[16:47.720 --> 16:55.480]  expanding along those lines this is out of the hill newspaper number of health care reform law
[16:55.480 --> 17:06.200]  waivers climbs above 1000 1040 organizations including fortune 500 companies like mcdonald's
[17:06.200 --> 17:16.920]  have been given complete and total waivers from having to buy health insurance but then your
[17:16.920 --> 17:27.320]  company does the essence the essence of unfair weights and measures the essence of tyranny the
[17:27.320 --> 17:42.200]  essence of fraud of government special favors handed out to their minions this is mafia government
[17:42.200 --> 17:51.880]  we're going to be going over more of that as well i really can't do justice to this but
[17:51.880 --> 18:07.080]  it really is a hollow victory in that ego-wise i could care less but it does signify that we are
[18:07.080 --> 18:12.280]  breaking through more and more to the mainstream when they've tried to have a blockade of our
[18:12.280 --> 18:19.480]  information for over a decade but two different articles in rolling stone two online one big
[18:19.480 --> 18:35.720]  feature one in the march issue that starts on page 50 and it says the most paranoid man in
[18:35.720 --> 18:43.160]  america yeah i wish i was just paranoid i wish this information wasn't right uh there's this
[18:43.160 --> 18:52.280]  big feature report in rolling stone and there's also another one that's i think a lot better
[18:52.280 --> 18:59.080]  by the same author that was just online glenbeck shtick alex jones got there first and they go
[18:59.080 --> 19:05.640]  over a detailed analysis of glenbeck ripping us off word for word which i wouldn't have a problem
[19:05.640 --> 19:11.880]  with except that then he does things like block me from getting on fox news as a guest which
[19:11.880 --> 19:18.760]  isn't that big of a deal except that it just shows him telling people then who are guest on this show
[19:19.560 --> 19:23.720]  to not be guessed on this show or that he won't interview them i've been told this by prominent

[24:22.360 --> 24:30.920]  kadafi insists al-qaeda is to blame for chaos and killings and that's absolutely right who did
[24:30.920 --> 24:37.640]  they use to attack the serbs in the 1990s al-qaeda on record who did they use to attack the russians
[24:37.640 --> 24:44.440]  to start that war mujahideen slash al-qaeda who did they use over and over again as their
[24:44.440 --> 24:50.360]  frontline vanguard it's the muslim brigades but the general public could never get it through
[24:50.360 --> 24:57.720]  their head that the muslim extremists are financed and funded by the globalist it's just that simple
[24:58.600 --> 25:06.200]  and now british special forces have been captured we of course reported a month ago that they were
[25:06.200 --> 25:13.960]  already in libya before this turmoil even began kadafi insists al-qaeda is to blame for chaos and
[25:13.960 --> 25:20.920]  killings in an exclusive interview with france 24 libyan leader muammar kadafi repeated his claim
[25:20.920 --> 25:26.840]  that al-qaeda was responsible for plunging the country into chaos and denied media reports of mass
[25:26.840 --> 25:34.200]  killings al-qaeda is responsible for the violent uprising in libya but western media has overstated
[25:34.200 --> 25:40.680]  the extent of the political crisis and its casualty leader muammar kadafi told frances 24
[25:40.680 --> 25:46.440]  in an exclusive interview on sunday he also said look out millions of black africans are coming
[25:46.440 --> 25:51.640]  your way europe if you let libya fall and it is true that he's been controlling immigration
[25:53.640 --> 26:01.320]  from north africa over the mediterranean into southern europe there have been almost
[26:01.320 --> 26:06.760]  a hundred fifty two hundred people killed people should come here and see how many people have
[26:06.760 --> 26:13.160]  been killed they can come and check among the population among the police and the army a seemingly
[26:13.160 --> 26:20.280]  collected kadafi explained all right i'm gonna stop right here i'm not a fan of kadafi not a fan of
[26:22.440 --> 26:28.760]  hazy mubarak any of these guys but there's no doubt now it's admitted on record that western
[26:28.760 --> 26:37.640]  intelligence is overthrowing these countries and putting basically new puppet dictators in power
[26:38.360 --> 26:47.640]  in egypt and now to the west of egypt in libya they're attempting this and now they're openly saying
[26:48.280 --> 26:56.360]  yes uh senator carrey says we need to bomb their airfields and have air strikes on key installations
[26:56.360 --> 27:05.400]  and we need to have a no fly zone and shoot down their aircraft and jam them jam their military
[27:05.400 --> 27:11.240]  frequencies but all of us agree there should be no military action only bombing their airfields
[27:12.920 --> 27:18.600]  that's like saying all of us agree that we should not punch you in the nose so we're going to punch
[27:18.600 --> 27:24.520]  you in your nose now because we agree we shouldn't punch you in the nose they just practice absurdity
[27:24.520 --> 27:31.800]  like we're unconscious idiots because they know the general public is unconscious that they're in a
[27:31.800 --> 27:37.480]  dream state watching television but more and more people are actually seeing through it
[27:38.120 --> 27:46.440]  but kadafi insists al qaeda is to blame for chaos and killings now this this was from saturday

[32:58.040 --> 33:14.440]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[33:19.560 --> 33:25.320]  now we already heard this three weeks ago but they're putting it back out again
[33:25.320 --> 33:33.960]  and all joseph watson has the headline at prism planet dot com oil and gold slip on rumors kadafi
[33:33.960 --> 33:39.800]  set to flee but again we've already heard that he ran to venezuela three weeks ago
[33:41.320 --> 33:47.080]  oil and gold paired some of their soaring gains today after a rumor began circulating that muammar
[33:47.080 --> 33:51.720]  kadafi was seeking to reach an agreement with rebels that would allow him to safely flee the
[33:51.720 --> 33:57.160]  country and return for relinquishing power well i mean he could just fly out of the country why
[33:57.160 --> 34:02.840]  does he need rebels authorization that makes no sense gold hit another record high this morning
[34:03.720 --> 34:13.560]  rising to 1445 and 70 cents an ounce before reversing itself as traders absorbed the rumors
[34:13.560 --> 34:23.720]  similarly ice brint april oil hit 118 and 50 cents peak before pulling back the pullback
[34:23.720 --> 34:33.240]  was sparked by rumors that kadafi sent a negotiator to transnational council in order to secure the
[34:33.240 --> 34:38.600]  safe exit of him and his family and return for him handing over power the rebel leaders
[34:38.600 --> 34:46.200]  the rebel leaders can only hold a few towns and cities and he has all the airfields he has
[34:46.200 --> 34:52.040]  allies all over africa he's paid off this doesn't make sense i mean i know watson's quoting
[34:52.040 --> 34:58.440]  mainstream news reports but it's very strange and of course it's the usual suspects the bbc
[34:58.440 --> 35:04.040]  saying this it was the british foreign secretary saying this three weeks ago as well the story
[35:04.040 --> 35:12.120]  was carried by the pan arab newspaper alshark alzawat and was also picked up by bbc living
[35:12.120 --> 35:20.120]  in sources have told the pan arab newspaper the colonel kadafi has turned the rebel transnational
[35:20.120 --> 35:27.080]  council to secure his departure from the country in return for guaranteeing his and his family
[35:27.080 --> 35:37.320]  safety he sent a negotiator on his behalf to bengazi and have been discussing handing over power
[35:37.320 --> 35:44.200]  before libya's parliament the general people's congress his condition the sources say i don't
[35:44.200 --> 35:49.880]  know if you can believe any of this so this is done to again further make it look like that he's
[35:49.880 --> 36:00.440]  destabilized that he's weak what's the larger issue for this what's the what's the larger reason
[36:01.320 --> 36:08.120]  that they want this they want the entire region in flames they want to destabilize the planet
[36:08.120 --> 36:13.800]  the globalist want order out of chaos it's it's it's really very very simple what's happening
[36:13.800 --> 36:19.640]  and if you look at the people that run our government and run our country
[36:20.920 --> 36:25.240]  they have the same amount of respect for us that they have for the libyans
[36:25.240 --> 36:34.360]  or for the iraqis uh or for people in zimbabwe or argentina the globalist are ruthless parasites
[36:34.360 --> 36:43.400]  who are sucking us dry and they could care less about our well-being in fact they want
[36:43.400 --> 36:49.080]  to use poverty as a tool of systematic degradation and control
[36:58.760 --> 37:01.400]  let me do this let me go ahead and go to some of your phone calls
[37:02.600 --> 37:06.040]  and then i'm going to continue with what's happening in north africa in fact let me just run
[37:06.040 --> 37:11.480]  through the headlines on this now first we were hearing how invincible the sas were and how they're
[37:11.480 --> 37:18.520]  basically supermen that no one can stop this was the headline saturday fancy fancy all chances
[37:18.520 --> 37:27.560]  against the sas goddafi elite elite troops and mi6 spies poised to help libyan rebels
[37:28.600 --> 37:36.120]  this is all part of the illusion that globalist forces are are invincible the image of mi6
[37:36.120 --> 37:49.960]  people being james bond or the image of uh fbi agents being like you know 24 but then when you
[37:49.960 --> 37:59.240]  really are out covering issues or at bilderberg covering an event and you see the fbi most of
[37:59.240 --> 38:04.840]  them are like clowns in their little black suits trying to intimidate you talking into their arm
[38:04.840 --> 38:11.000]  piece it's just all a bunch of hype it's all a big big illusion all these big towering marble
[38:11.000 --> 38:17.640]  government buildings are meant to make you feel small all of this is so that you feel weak when
[38:17.640 --> 38:28.040]  in truth you have all the power uh continuing here they were talking about fancy yourselves
[38:28.040 --> 38:36.920]  against the sas you're not gonna be doing too well you could have a sas on the ground one sas
[38:36.920 --> 38:46.200]  man is worth 10 000 north africans nothing can stop them well here you go uh libya eight sas
[38:46.200 --> 38:55.000]  soldiers held by rebels the webbles uh remember was it six years ago it's actually in my film
[38:55.000 --> 39:02.200]  terror storm a history government sponsored terror they caught sas dressed up like sunnies
[39:02.760 --> 39:08.920]  running around shooting shiites in basura as a pretext to get the two groups killing each other
[39:09.880 --> 39:13.080]  and then when they captured them dressed up with the machine guns and
[39:14.200 --> 39:22.200]  plastic explosives running around mischief making they sent british tanks in to assault the jail
[39:22.200 --> 39:28.760]  and killed a bunch of the iraqi police a little civil war because they were starting to interrogate
[39:28.760 --> 39:34.600]  them about the british staging terror attacks all over iraq let me tell you who pulls triggers on
[39:34.600 --> 39:42.440]  our troops british israeli and us contractors i would have to say from the numbers i've seen
[39:42.440 --> 39:49.320]  in internal sources more than half the dead us troops were killed by our own people you're like
[39:49.320 --> 39:54.760]  well that doesn't make sense it makes perfect sense you got a trillion bucks a year going to those

[40:09.640 --> 40:14.280]  then in two years we're going to pull out well secretary defense gates announced today that
[40:14.280 --> 40:23.080]  it now they won't look at pulling out till 2014 and then in 2014 they'll look at pulling out in

[40:33.240 --> 40:43.640]  and in 2050 something folks they'll look at it in 2050 too and then you complain and say i don't
[40:43.640 --> 40:50.120]  want to be there and gates is like you know how much opium there is here 500 bill a year we're never
[40:50.120 --> 40:57.160]  leaving and by the way when your kids get caught running this stuff up their veins we're going to
[40:57.160 --> 41:04.120]  put them in prisons owned by the same private central banks that launder the money and the
[41:04.120 --> 41:14.280]  average yuppie's going to go good i like it and that's why we failed you know last night i was
[41:14.280 --> 41:21.560]  watching television i was watching history channel or the military channel and i couldn't help but
[41:22.840 --> 41:33.640]  feeling all patriotic and pro war watching world war two reels the military channel they were
[41:33.640 --> 41:42.360]  airing old news reels about the march in the pacific and about the island hopping and taking
[41:42.360 --> 41:48.600]  this island and then taking that island and an emotional level i was all proud of america defeating
[41:48.600 --> 41:56.600]  the japanese but even by that point in the 1940s early 1940s been 1940s our country been taken over
[41:56.600 --> 42:02.280]  by the private central banks that had maneuvered the japanese to attack us that had cut off their
[42:02.280 --> 42:09.080]  oil that had us forces operating as private mercenaries the flying tigers and others attacking
[42:09.080 --> 42:17.160]  the japanese all over the pacific out of china and it was all just a giant setup
[42:20.840 --> 42:26.040]  and then we won world war two so we felt like we're the good guys we can do no wrong
[42:26.040 --> 42:31.640]  so we totally trust the government and the bill of rights and constitution have basically
[42:31.640 --> 42:39.320]  been overturned and then now here's our government using our country to launch wars in libya afghanistan
[42:39.960 --> 42:47.800]  iraq i mean our troops are in 160 plus countries and they're not our troops it's not our military
[42:50.760 --> 42:56.360]  our military is running illegal checkpoints all over the country our military is training with
[42:56.360 --> 43:02.600]  foreign troops for gun confiscation our military every chance they get during a natural disaster
[43:02.600 --> 43:08.600]  like katrina doesn't bring food and water they come in and confiscate the guns and it's it's all on
[43:08.600 --> 43:17.320]  the news and i was thinking about this last night because i keep revisiting this periodically
[43:18.840 --> 43:24.200]  but never really getting into it in any detail i need to go back and pull up all the old mainstream
[43:24.200 --> 43:30.040]  news articles and show this progressive rollout i guess police state for a rise of fema actually
[43:30.040 --> 43:37.320]  does it but i want to do like a short report with it all in it and i just think about how much it
[43:37.320 --> 43:48.200]  freaks me out to have this article and others from two weeks ago canada us agree to use each
[43:48.200 --> 43:55.880]  other's troops in civil emergencies now again
[43:59.800 --> 44:03.720]  this came out under the spp
[44:09.640 --> 44:14.600]  and it came out in the news again just a few weeks ago the copy that i have printed here is
[44:14.600 --> 44:26.120]  actually from february 22nd 2008 but the issue is then just last year we heard us troops are up at the
[44:27.640 --> 44:34.840]  olympics to help look for terrorists all of this stuff moves incrementally the globalists take
[44:34.840 --> 44:43.960]  their time isolating us conditioning us rolling these programs out and i just think about
[44:43.960 --> 44:50.440]  the threat fusion centers and the stasi police rollouts and all the different things that are
[44:50.440 --> 44:58.840]  happening and the biometrics going in to buy and sell and the surveillance grid and the tsa
[44:58.840 --> 45:04.920]  rolling on the streets i mean we know that this is an authoritarian corrupt evil government
[45:04.920 --> 45:10.840]  that's illegitimate and all i could say is what are we going to do about it all right that's enough
[45:10.840 --> 45:16.280]  i said i take a lot of calls and even though i'm under the weather uh i haven't gone to any of your
[45:16.280 --> 45:24.440]  phone calls let's go ahead and talk to john in texas john you're on the air hi elix hey buddy
[45:25.480 --> 45:30.920]  i want to respond to that guy friday that uh said that uh all the jews are behind a new world order
[45:30.920 --> 45:36.760]  and they should all be dealt gone away with back in 1973 it was a jew that worked me woke me up to
[45:36.760 --> 45:42.120]  the new world order alan stang and to listen to his radio program on a regular basis i joined a
[45:42.120 --> 45:46.840]  john birch society and through the john birch society i got to meet him in person he was really
[45:46.840 --> 45:55.480]  a nice guy and really a great american and you look at erin russell and and uh and uh uh url
[45:55.480 --> 46:01.160]  and shift how many years has he spent in prison fighting rs and uh you know i could go on there
[46:01.160 --> 46:09.320]  look look look look low low grade analex always like to say it's the whites it's the blacks
[46:09.320 --> 46:14.920]  it's the jews it's the this it's the that it's a way for them to feel good about themselves
[46:15.640 --> 46:24.120]  always uh and when people attack this show with made up stuff it's about them saying i've succeeded
[46:24.120 --> 46:30.600]  in life i'm better than alex jones and you know i probably shouldn't have cut that collar off i
[46:30.600 --> 46:34.760]  probably should have let him go longer because i said so we should get rid of all the jews he said
[46:34.760 --> 46:39.800]  yes we should get rid of all of them and then i let the guy go and i saw a few emails and comments
[46:39.800 --> 46:45.480]  saying he didn't mean kill them all he just meant get rid of them but so i should just open the
[46:45.480 --> 46:51.400]  phones up for nothing but nazis to call someday so people can really hear who these folks are
[46:52.200 --> 46:56.520]  but i mean it's the same thing maybe i should open the phones up that'd be interesting radio
[46:56.520 --> 47:02.040]  just for the black nationalist you know who say kill all the whites they all sound exactly the
[47:02.040 --> 47:07.240]  same they're just different colored skin uh and i mean there's no doubt israel's corrupt there's no
[47:07.240 --> 47:12.600]  doubt all these countries are there's no doubt israel's up to its eyeballs in every form of
[47:12.600 --> 47:18.600]  you know wickedness you could imagine but to sit there and talk about you know millions and millions
[47:18.600 --> 47:25.000]  of people and just with a broad brush say well because the chinese government's corrupt all chinese
[47:25.000 --> 47:32.920]  are evil but uh but again the globalist count on this i've just never seen groups more hateful
[47:32.920 --> 47:42.440]  even of each other and more infighting and more just craziness uh than than the nazis but uh uh
[47:42.440 --> 47:47.480]  john i mean it it's really just a diversion from everything else that's happening anything else on
[47:47.480 --> 47:53.000]  your mind yeah i just was going to say that you know in a free republic individual was responsible
[47:53.000 --> 47:59.400]  for his own actions and uh when we move against the new world order if people are brought to trial
[47:59.400 --> 48:03.240]  they're the individual the guy that did the crimes are going to pay it ain't going to be
[48:03.240 --> 48:07.160]  released ain't going to be religion we're going after the individuals and that's the way it should
[48:07.160 --> 48:13.880]  be in in this country well john you've got the right uh perspective there we need to talk about
[48:14.440 --> 48:22.360]  i mean really get it conscious in our minds this is not rhetoric uh these are not spurious charges
[48:22.360 --> 48:28.600]  we're laying out these are detailed the global crime syndicate let's name them jp morgan goldman
[48:28.600 --> 48:36.120]  sacks bank of england uh the roth childs the rockefellers queen batrix uh the british wealth
[48:36.120 --> 48:43.240]  family i mean these are people with real power engaged in real corruption using our name our
[48:43.240 --> 48:53.960]  treasure our countries to launch their corporate empires and we need to talk about justice and
[48:53.960 --> 48:58.440]  point out that they're criminals and introduce the idea that they that they can and must be brought
[48:58.440 --> 49:14.680]  to justice i appreciate your call i um i don't even know what to say anymore
[49:14.680 --> 49:20.760]  there's no doubt that the social engineers of our planet have decided to go all the way
[49:20.760 --> 49:30.600]  there's no doubt that the social engineers of this planet have decided to pull out all
[49:30.600 --> 49:41.000]  the stops uh you know the signpost on the way to that the signpost illustrating that are are are
[49:41.000 --> 50:01.400]  legion but when i think about the nerve of the va 12 years ago in 1999 signing now public but then
[50:01.400 --> 50:13.400]  secret deals to take all the death benefits from world war two through to today and through fraud
[50:14.840 --> 50:20.680]  to have the troops pay into life insurance policies but then when they die to not have
[50:20.680 --> 50:27.400]  it paid to their widows or widowers i mean ladies and gentlemen can you wrap your brain
[50:27.400 --> 50:31.960]  around the fact that that is in mainstream news and no one even gets in trouble
[50:34.680 --> 50:40.840]  tell me can you wrap your mind around the fact that they know depleted uranium is a death sentence
[50:40.840 --> 50:46.760]  for our troops 20 years ago they didn't let the troops use it why do they let them use it now
[50:46.760 --> 50:52.760]  they don't care it's like the globalists are self-destructive nutcases

[54:16.600 --> 54:27.720]  and it's very hard to attain but it's very very easy to lose and more and more i realize the
[54:27.720 --> 54:36.280]  bedrock of our problems is that we have been beguiled by the hollywood culture the tv culture
[54:38.040 --> 54:43.160]  the issues of little or no significance we've been given things that really don't have value
[54:43.160 --> 54:48.760]  you and and and we've been taught that those things have value so that while we're chasing
[54:48.760 --> 54:57.000]  after the glitter while we're chasing after the gold dust the real things that really do matter
[54:57.000 --> 55:04.840]  like family and private property and the right to self-defense are being eroded all right
[55:04.840 --> 55:10.600]  let's go back to your calls now will mohammed scott steven al i know we've been having max
[55:10.600 --> 55:14.520]  kaiser on a lot because he's been in the middle east he's going to be popping back in anway madson
[55:16.360 --> 55:20.840]  again if you just joined us and if i sound a bit slow today i'm i'm still sick i have the flu i
[55:20.840 --> 55:26.840]  believe uh but i'm i'm i'm here i should be completely better by tomorrow uh let's go ahead
[55:26.840 --> 55:32.680]  and talk to will in new york will you're on the air hey uh first uh i'll say a couple things first
[55:32.680 --> 55:37.320]  let me say that to all the listeners if they haven't done it today already uh get yourself a couple
[55:37.320 --> 55:42.440]  facts about nine eleven and just go out you know keep talking to people anybody who doesn't know
[55:42.440 --> 55:46.760]  the facts you know just keep pushing it because i really feel like it's one of the most important
[55:46.760 --> 55:52.920]  things that we can do as americans to get nine eleven is the bedrock of their entire takeover
[55:52.920 --> 56:00.440]  and that's why the globalist staged it uh okay so i just that and uh well you know i thought it
[56:00.440 --> 56:06.360]  was interesting how uh clinton mentioned russia today but you know i don't watch a lot of tv or
[56:06.360 --> 56:11.400]  i listen to a lot of like mainstream media but i i saw a lot about alga zera in the media i didn't
[56:11.400 --> 56:16.120]  see anything about russia today and i think part of the reason is because they talk about
[56:16.120 --> 56:20.600]  nine eleven truth a lot i mean i've i've seen a lot of a lot of stuff with you a lot of stuff
[56:20.600 --> 56:26.840]  about nine eleven truth no no alga zera is is heavily connected to british intelligence
[56:27.560 --> 56:33.800]  and it's being used to foment these revolutions all over the middle east uh but then selectively
[56:33.800 --> 56:41.800]  not foment revolution uh in the country where it's based uh katar cutter uh but that's a good point
[56:41.800 --> 56:48.200]  i appreciate your call will mohammed in canada you're on the air go ahead uh hey uh hey alex how
[56:48.200 --> 56:54.680]  you doing good um yeah i just wanted to uh just leave a few uh just leave a few comments um just
[56:54.680 --> 57:00.280]  on the whole situation i was going on right now in the middle east um i i these things have been
[57:00.280 --> 57:04.840]  going on for a long time and it's interesting right now how they're just uh really you know
[57:04.840 --> 57:09.080]  cementing it right now as you know revolution these things like there's always been these
[57:09.080 --> 57:13.720]  outcries against the government and just like for this to be like broadcasted right now in our
[57:13.720 --> 57:18.680]  media i feel like it's kind of just to detail it away from what's going on here in north america
[57:18.680 --> 57:23.240]  and these you know uh our our standard of living is dropping and these type of things are happening
[57:23.240 --> 57:27.480]  to us i think it's just kind of just focusing at it focusing everybody's energy over there
[57:27.480 --> 57:33.320]  keeping it away from over here now that's another great point uh the but our government's telling
[57:33.320 --> 57:41.000]  us the economy's great the economy's wonderful uh and uh there's no inflation either and everything's
[57:41.000 --> 57:49.000]  fine uh but uh remember what lindsay williams said four months ago now almost five months ago
[57:49.000 --> 57:54.840]  about oil prices and he's certainly being proven right so far so we'll continue to watch that as
[57:54.840 --> 58:01.480]  it develops anything else mohammed yeah i just uh another thing i just wanted to uh um plug in a

[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:47.640]  calls 800-259-9231 let's talk to scott and arkansas scott you're on the air welcome
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.160]  hey alex um you know i've been listening to you for a few years i'm first time caller
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:03.160]  and uh you know i i've seen these rolling blackouts coming while back
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:13.320]  and uh you know i i went ahead and got myself off the grid and uh solar and wind power but it
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:20.360]  wasn't just uh to save money you know our light bill or anything it's to get ready for what's coming
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:26.120]  down the pike as you will know yeah i'm trying to move to solar myself from people that understand
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:31.480]  this the globalist are going to use environmental rules they've stated this to shut down most of
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:36.680]  the power plants only a few that they own are going to be able to operate and they'll supply a lot
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:43.320]  less electricity at a higher price it's called artificial scarcity and it gives them the power
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:49.000]  over you dictators are always obsessed with limiting the amount of electricity you get it's
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.680]  all part of their control and so they're now announcing in the u.s europe and england that they
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:02:00.680]  are going to not be giving us power at night now and uh the head of the energy department announced
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:08.680]  hundreds and hundreds of plants to be shut down it's totally sick what are these smart meters playing
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:13.800]  when they go oh they know smart meters go together like a horse in carriage yeah they said well during
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:17.480]  power restrictions because there won't be enough power because there's not enough power plants
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:23.800]  they'll decide you can't have your house it's at 80 it's going to have to be at 90 or they're going
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:29.000]  to turn your power on and off and they admit this and they're going in all over the country again
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:35.640]  imagine somebody 20 years ago if you told them in america the government is going to control your
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:41.160]  thermostat you would laugh at them but now if you're against the government turning your thermostat
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:46.840]  on and off you get laughed at by the yuppies they're like rolling blackouts of freedom having the
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:52.200]  government run my thermostat is freedom having telescreens telling me to spy on my neighbors
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:58.680]  in walmart is freedom having the government try to make me take force inoculations is freedom
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:06.200]  having my iq lower is freedom having cancer rates explode is freedom taking the pension funds is
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:12.360]  freedom we like it we love it and so i'm like yuppies enjoy yourselves you're going to get all

[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:32.280]  and other weather modification chemicals and high amounts in it and then scientists reverse
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:38.440]  engineered we reverse engineered that it was kim trails and now they have it in us say today
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:45.080]  hey oh yeah we're mixing with the jet fuel to block out the solar radiation to stop global warming
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:51.400]  it's a big secret program don't worry about it enjoy it i mean can you imagine the power trip

[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:23.080]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:28.680]  grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:33.880]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:38.440]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:28.360]  texas alex jones it is abundantly clear the globalists are trying to trigger a destabilization
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:33.240]  campaign to middle east north africa it is a hundred percent confirmed that they are triggering the
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:40.920]  revolt against muammar qaddafi the overthrow of huzy mubarak now saudi arabia is into two weeks of
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:48.280]  riots and banning protests and tanks driving around tear gassing people i mean this is getting
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:56.280]  crazier and crazier by the minute and the underlying cause is dollar devaluation increasing food
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:04.840]  prices worldwide because every major currency is pegged to the dollar and meanwhile the imf and
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:12.440]  world bank have been going into these countries and pressuring them to cut food stamps to cut food
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:19.320]  allotments knowing that that will even exacerbate it more then they send in their people to trigger
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:25.960]  rebels trying to overthrow the government and that's why muammar qaddafi says al qaeda is behind
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:33.320]  the chaos and he says that people trained who were held at guantanamo bay thousands have been held
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:38.520]  there on and off again are the ones leading the attack well that actually fits with what we've
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:46.120]  seen in other nations they quote get these people brainwash them train them prepare them and then
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:51.800]  send them out but then you tell the average american hey al qaeda works for our government even though
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:57.960]  the evidence is overwhelming they're like oh sure it does it's incredible i mean who would ever
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:09.000]  over imagine that it was something that sounds so crazy but if you look at the history of it they
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:19.080]  used al qaeda to overthrow the serbs in kosovo they use al qaeda all over the world to trigger
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:26.920]  crises and what is al qaeda it's the cia computer database name for muslim extremists on their
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:32.760]  payroll okay let's go to your phone calls steven and florida you're on the air
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:40.920]  yeah uh you know i was thinking about everything that we're up against in this battle with the
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:49.720]  globalists and you know to me you got it nailed on the hat with the subtitle of your site uh
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:54.680]  where it says there's a war on for your mind and you know this is the thing i find is the
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:11:01.080]  number one obstacle that we're up against uh because there's so much psychological warfare
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:07.240]  going on and the average american they have no clue as to what this is uh you know i'll say to
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:12.920]  people all the time you know look at tv and i get the same response i say why do you think they call
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:18.520]  it programming and don't laugh and then all of a sudden it's like this light clicks and they go you
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:24.040]  know you're right and you know you've pointed out about the device itself with the flicker effect
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:28.440]  and how now they're finding early Alzheimer's and people because of it shutting down your brain
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:34.040]  and putting it in sleep mode and by the way uh we've got dr nick baggach on tomorrow just on
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:41.000]  this subject the hundreds of patents confirming that they cannot just lower your iq lower your
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:49.160]  overall cognitive ability or lower your overall brainwaves they can actually program you and and
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:55.560]  and and physiology they can manipulate the physiology of the body with these systems and
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:12:03.720]  we have a culture for 50 years that watches five six seven hours of tv a day not just with the
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:10.360]  overt message of the programming but also the overall subliminal messages that's why the average
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:16.120]  yuppie automatically giggles at you when you bring this up to them because they're in they're in a
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:23.000]  dreamlike trans-like state right yeah you're exactly right you know and i i've just really
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.720]  been trying to talk to people about this because here's what i see what this all comes down to
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:32.920]  its eugenics now you pointed out all the stuff about you know then the food and the water and
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:37.400]  how they're spraying us so they're physically they're incrementally making us sick and trying
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:43.960]  to kill us but it's the more uh deeper thing uh because it's so much more subtle and stealth
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:50.520]  like and that is the psychological propaganda and that the whole mode of work that these people
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:54.200]  are into their masters at it as you pointed out well that's what i was thinking last night
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:58.840]  whenever i was watching the battle for the pacific newsreels was it was the same way the
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:05.000]  military systematically encircled the japanese that's what the globalists are doing to us they
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:12.600]  systematically roll forward creeping running their programs they're basically adding toxins
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:20.680]  in our food water air to dumb us down so that we're basically so brain damaged and so acclimated
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:27.480]  that as we move forward uh you know towards the the the huge extermination programs that are coming
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:33.800]  in the future where they release these mega plagues and blame it on al-qaeda or you know uh the the
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:41.640]  flavor of the day that then people will expect this as almost prophecy or a foregone conclusion
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:47.800]  because in all the high schools and junior highs and tv and everywhere they're teaching us that it's
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:53.240]  beautiful that man is soon going to be extinct and that it's a foregone conclusion that it's a
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:14:01.080]  self-fulfilling prophecy and so the globalists are going ahead with this plan i know about it you
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:07.720]  know about it they've written their plan but how do you get brain damaged and also chemically but
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:14.280]  also electronically mind-controlled people to hear what you're saying or even if you can wake
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:19.320]  them up then how do you get them to have enough respect in themselves to believe that they can
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:27.800]  resist this i mean listen you talk about conformity steve i had a new york uh magazine reporter here
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:35.400]  last week and when i talked about bohemian grove and luciferianism he started laughing at me and
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:40.440]  i said well even if you don't believe in god and the devil you know they do take it serious at
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:49.640]  bohemian grove but he still thought it was funny you know to him it was funny and well finish your
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:54.680]  point i'm gonna make a point go ahead well i'm just gonna say you know you're talking about the way
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:59.480]  people react because they're program their condition i remember years ago being in a defensive
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:06.040]  driving class and here they were had the segment on drunk driving at the office y'all and these kids
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.880]  were sitting there you know i was older than most of most of our teens but they're showing about
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:15.320]  these two little girls who had gotten permanently disabled in an accident caused by drunk driver
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:21.160]  and these people sitting in the room are laughing and i'm just thinking what is there funny about
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:26.200]  that and yet they just think it's a joke because and here's what i think it is you're talking about
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:31.560]  solution and this is one reason the tea party movement happened and you know on and on and on
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:36.440]  but people are seeing things now coming closer and closer to their door unfortunately in america
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:42.040]  we live by the mindset out of sight out of mind as long as it comes doesn't come to my door i don't
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:46.040]  have to deal with it i think people are starting to get really scared they can't put their finger on
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:50.280]  what's going on but they know something's up and if people like you and me that have the right
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:55.640]  information can come on and appeal to them on a human level that they can emotionally relate to
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:16:01.560]  as well as psychologically that may be enough of a spot to wake them up because you know we're all
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:07.240]  humans and we can all live in relation to each other but i'm like you out so look at this and
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:12.200]  sometimes you scratch your head and go man what is it going to take to wake some of these people off
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:17.640]  well uh wonderful call steve please call back because you really let it all out crystal clear
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:25.400]  and i've told the story about world war two vets and people who didn't like watching violent
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:31.800]  movies and it wasn't because they were wimps it was because they'd been involved in reality
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:37.720]  and so they didn't think watching somebody get chopped up or tortured to death was funny
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:46.520]  meanwhile you take a domesticated decadent weak teenager who's had everything handed to him in
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:54.520]  life and they go watch a movie like saw or hostile where people are being tortured to death and being
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:17:02.040]  killed and it's so cool it's so wonderful the torturers are even moral they have some weird
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:08.120]  reason they're doing it and they sit there and giggle and laugh at it and it's just like people
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:17.160]  that sit there and giggle and laugh at seeing disabled children it's very fashionable online
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:25.320]  now to abuse animals uh there's all sorts of videos everywhere of uh the compliment of a
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:30.200]  good-looking woman kind of kicking a dog or being mean to a cat or something like that
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:37.080]  and people get off on that they're self hating at a core level as victor hugo said
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:48.520]  prosperity and adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters and so this always happens
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:56.680]  in societal cultural cycles people then want to be destroyed they want to go into bondage
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:03.080]  they want to laugh at evil they want to laugh at corruption they want to make a joke out of
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:10.280]  everything and don't worry they will get hurt and then once they're in the jaws of the tyranny
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:17.400]  then they're going to squeal then they're going to beg and plead but never until they've actually
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:23.880]  reached that point because they haven't lived in reality and never have we had a population
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:37.000]  more divorced from reality more separated more disconnected sure you've got lots of people
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:43.800]  that are waking up but those those that aren't waking up are getting deeper into their delusion
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:55.160]  and people go through these cycles you know i don't want to talk more about charlie sheen but
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:58.920]  you know you can search the term charlie sheen says he's a born-again christian
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:03.720]  and you can see him in the mid-1990s become a born-again christian and i remember just being
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:09.320]  in his house like six years ago and him talking about god and our god-given rights and being a
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:18.120]  christian and then he goes off the rails for seven months and now he's come off the drugs
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:29.880]  and he's running around basically embracing deviltry and that's that's kind of what the
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:35.080]  culture's done it's that's why somebody in the culture identify with what charlie sheen's doing
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:41.480]  he's just my friend i hope gets better i mean i don't i see killing a million irakis is evil or
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:48.760]  abortion is evil i don't think charlie i don't sit there and judge him i worry about him

[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:21.960]  but see that's their answer is just to call ron paul a pinhead
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:31.560]  it's a world of delusional thinking and the globalist i believe are buying into their own
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:38.520]  thinking and they're very nihilistic let's talk to alan delaware than patrick steve
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:43.880]  dana bill and others go ahead al hey how you doing alex i hope you're feeling better buddy get a
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:50.520]  little water and chicken soup hey look a lot of this is aimed at the 77 million baby boomers
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:56.440]  getting ready to come into retirement they are stealing our wealth what's better to do to the
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:05.000]  enemy than weaken them tear them down systematically and this has been going on for 40 years obama
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:12.920]  is the most dangerous person in the white house or i should say as administration and when are people
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:20.600]  going to get it it is not going to fare well for the people that lift up their feet and ride along
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:29.160]  with the crowd think they're groovy because they hate industry it is going to be catastrophic what
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:34.600]  you're taking well you just said it i mean they think they're groovy they think being failures
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:41.880]  they think whatever is put out as slick and hip is cool i mean if the government told them eating
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:47.640]  cyanide was cool a lot of these people would run out and start gobbling it and the country is being
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:52.920]  deindustrialized so we can be bankrupted and controlled the globalists are openly bragging
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:59.400]  about it the death care the death panels is targeting all the baby boomers we are being
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:07.480]  dispossessed by design and i just hope we can turn it around you know the good news is anytime
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:11.960]  the people actually take action we're having victory we're stopping them when it comes to trying to
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:18.120]  get our guns they're starting to restrict abortion in more and more states there are so many things
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:24.360]  we're having victories on we've been holding them on the opening the borders up i mean you know
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:29.080]  they're already partially open but they're trying to completely open them we've been beating them on
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:35.000]  that i mean we're having a lot of victories but we're also having a lot of defeats and
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:41.240]  and as long as people are divided along the lines of republican democrat as long as people don't
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:46.840]  realize that at the top the republicans and democrats are in almost total agreement as
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:51.720]  long as people aren't aware of that al it's over anything else we're going to need independence
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:59.320]  in 2012 forget the republicans forget the democrats people it's over you better look at each other
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:06.920]  and make nice and get strong because it's going to get dark the wind is going to blow
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:13.720]  and you had better have your hatches bolted tight see you later alex al well said uh you know
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:18.440]  this weekend i was thinking about a way to just simply boil all this down
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:26.920]  and this is this is basically what we're facing as the general public we're given a false
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:36.200]  false holographic political projection that has very little to do with reality and then
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:44.200]  we basically fight and struggle and argue within that false projection okay
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:57.240]  and within that false projection the general public is powerless to ever
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:04.760]  take control of their own lives their own destinies but past the false political projection
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:11.960]  there is a scientific technological elite who has studied human psychology and how we operate
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:24.360]  that has a global plan to forcibly set up a world government and to then forcibly carry out
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:31.560]  massive population reduction so far what we've seen has been beta testing
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:38.840]  but the new systems being deployed once they've got their control grid in place
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:46.040]  once they've got their media system in place is going to be massive now i don't know if they're
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:53.240]  going to get away with pulling this off folks but they sure are trying we're on the march the empires
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:30:04.280]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:10.120]  the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:16.280]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:22.280]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:28.760]  of us as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:35.080]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:40.120]  government tim geithner bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:44.840]  is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in

[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:44.360]  in the middle east will be popping back in a little bit in the next hour but i wanted to get
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:51.080]  wane madson on he's been out in chicago quite a bit investigating the mob boss rama manual with
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:59.160]  his fixed election out there uh where the obama administration is going uh but before we go there
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:07.560]  with wane madson uh who by the way uh is a navy veteran uh he also worked with the national
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:16.680]  security agency he's been a commentator on fox news cnn rt uh you name it he also senior fellow
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:22.760]  with the electronic privacy information center wane madson report dot com uh is his website
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:32.520]  i wanted to get your take on the sas troops being captured in uh eastern libya on the evidence
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:43.720]  that uh the west was behind at least the initiation of the turmoil uh in egypt uh now uh the rioting
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:50.520]  intensifying in places like saudi arabia despite the fact that the king of doula pumped out 37
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:59.080]  million to the general public uh their banning protests there uh obviously the the initiating
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:06.760]  spark here uh is the situation with uh
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:14.760]  dollar devaluation causing causing food prices to go up in these countries but but but what
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:21.560]  else is behind this uh i mean is this staged in your view or what's the larger geopolitical
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:28.600]  ramifications of this wane madson well i think what happened is we we saw the arab uprising
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:35.480]  not confined to just tunisia and egypt that it it's spread into libya but i think uh at that
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:42.440]  point in time we had some outside players deciding hey look uh although we're we're cooperating with
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:49.240]  qaddafi there's a bunch of people holdovers from the old reagan and uh bush one administration
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:54.440]  when qaddafi was public enemy number one he said oh this is an excellent chance to get rid of him
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:36:01.880]  and i think obama and hillary clinton are really taking their orders now from a a group of multinational
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:08.280]  oil companies and the cia and we know about mi6 being caught red-handed with that team in eastern
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:14.920]  libya and now we have a report that obama has asked the saudis to provide the libyan rebels
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:20.840]  with weapons now that is absolutely the wrong thing to do because qaddafi's been harping on about
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:28.120]  al-qaeda is his major enemy here well we know that al-qaeda was a construct of the saudis they were
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:34.760]  the financiers they were the ones who provided the bodies uh along with the cia and to some extent
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:40.440]  the israelis back during that whole mooch had been fiasco in afghanistan and we're left with
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:49.000]  that mess too um i heard john mccain on one of the talking head shows talking about how qaddafi's
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:54.520]  been saying and he was likening to him to hitler well where have we heard that before we heard that
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:37:00.840]  when they were going after sudam who's saying when in fact it's it's insane mccain who who i think
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:05.960]  we can question you know his mentor that's right they just retread the same propaganda now they're
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:13.640]  claiming iran is going to get a yellow cake from an african nation again an exact retread of what
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:22.520]  we heard pre-war 2003 for that invasion and and here are the saudis and that's london telegraph
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:29.240]  being asked to ship in weapons and personnel obviously into the east and they are al-qaeda just
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:34.280]  like they used al-qaeda to go after the serbs i mean when are people going to figure this out that
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:43.000]  al-qaeda is basically an mi6 slash israeli us arm absolutely and now we have uh uh the phala regime
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  in yemen uh up against the wall with the massive uprising and what happened a few days ago al-qaeda
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:55.480]  and the arabian peninsula stages a terrorist attack well clear who's behind these attacks uh it's a
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:38:01.400]  it's an effort to shore up i there's a report that that the obama administration has decided
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:09.320]  they've drawn a line in the sand it may include now um uh some sort of a status quo uh in libya
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:15.240]  uh they don't want to see any more regimes fall uh especially the Saudis where we now have
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:23.080]  street demonstrations all through Saudi Arabia and uh it's very clear that the that the uh
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:28.760]  the elites um who run the oil companies and run the intelligence agencies are going to use the
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:39.960]  Saudis as as the this uh sort of last uh stopgap measure to try to save these faltering regimes
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:46.200]  but what's the larger geopolitical aim i mean obviously oil prices are going up our western
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:53.800]  media uh has been uh spinning things uh basically saying that oh we're going to have a recession
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:39:00.200]  or a depression uh because of what's happening in the arab nations is is this a political
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:07.000]  distraction for what's happening here domestically i think it's all i think what we're seeing is a
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:13.080]  global uprising against uh you know just the way these um oligarchs have been treating
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:20.680]  workers pensioners uh saying look you know we these bankers and oligarchs have stolen billions
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:28.200]  billions and trillions of dollars but you know you the you the um uh the guy who uh uh walks the
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:35.800]  beat in uh madison wisconsin and and you the the um uh public health uh official in new jersey
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:41.640]  you all have to take pay cuts and and see your possibly see your pensions frittered away so
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:47.640]  i think this is all part of the same global uprising whether it's in the streets of Cairo or
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:53.400]  the streets of madison or Trenton new jersey and i think now now is the time when the oligarchs see
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:40:00.920]  never as they haven't seen for many years uh they see that there's a possibility that people are
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:05.960]  waking up you know the arabs are calling this the great awakening they've been in a sort of a coma
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:12.440]  for so long having to deal with these uh western imposed regimes but i think uh i think there's a
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:19.080]  an awakening you don't have to be on the air of street uh to be uh experiencing this awakening i
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:26.920]  so basically you're saying that this has real organic roots but the global oligarchs are trying
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:34.360]  to manipulate these revolutions uh to keep their people in power i think so i think so and and uh
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:39.880]  you know we saw we saw the uh the regimes that took over from the dictators in tunisia
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:45.400]  in egypt they were not a heck of a lot different than what we saw uh with mubarak and banali in
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:50.760]  those countries but now we've seen uh a lot of replacements and uh that for example the new foreign
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:58.840]  minister of egypt uh named just uh today uh is saying look uh uh it's not business as usual and
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:03.240]  and he uh he happened to have been one of the demonstrators on career squares so now we're
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:08.760]  seeing people coming into these governments who are committed to change rather than these sort of
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:16.680]  uh placeholders that uh were very much linked with the past regime how do you see this ending i mean
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:22.360]  as you said this is happening in eastern europe greece ireland uh starting to spread here to the
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:27.400]  united states how do you see this ending and how do you see the global is trying to respond
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:34.520]  to this global awakening a new world war well i of course still try anything we may see an increase
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:39.720]  in terrorist attacks like we've already seen with this phony construct called al qaeda in the arabic
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:45.000]  peninsula that's taken place in yemen i've been talking to some people familiar with south arabia
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.960]  the south will pull that rabbit out of their hat too you you may see some terrorist attacks on the
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:56.760]  in it for example the oil rich eastern province which has two million she is uh demanding uh some
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:03.240]  rights uh we may see some sort of staged events there we know that the maliki government in bagdad
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:08.600]  is now up against the wall by because these people are in the streets demonstrating there
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:14.840]  and as this puppet regime of course it's still being protected by uh you know a few uh thousands
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:21.240]  of uh tens of thousands of american troops and uh and of course maliki is also pulling the al qaeda
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:26.440]  wrap it out of the hat saying well this is al qaeda in mesopotamia the algerians where there
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:33.080]  are uh demonstrations and we know khaddafi have also used this uh bogeyman of al qaeda so i think
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:39.640]  they're gonna they're gonna probably resurrect al qaeda like we've never seen before but at the
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:46.360]  same time there's some truth to it not the public al qaeda but the saudi slash us british israeli
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:52.200]  backed al qaeda oh absolutely i think they're one in the same i i think al qaeda from the very
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:57.240]  beginning going back to what uh the late foreign secretary of britain robin cook said look al qaeda
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:03.400]  is nothing more than a cia database of financiers uh uh you know uh people sure i mean i understand
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:09.000]  that but i'm saying yes i was getting from what you're saying that khaddafi's making up an al qaeda
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:13.880]  threat but but then i was adding but the saudi's are being asked to bring weapons and things in
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:19.160]  wouldn't that be a real al qaeda threat it's just that it's not the al qaeda the public's told about
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:24.760]  it's the real al qaeda right i i think i think khaddafi and this is not what we've seen because
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:30.680]  uh they they caught those british guys they caught some touch uh commandos uh we know about this now
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:37.720]  this saudi arrangement is being uh talked about in the media uh i think this is we see now khaddafi
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:43.320]  going on a fence uh where he was really i think up against the wall to the summit his forces are
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:50.680]  now reclaiming uh cities that were captured by the libyan rebels and uh i think that uh what
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:56.280]  we're seeing now is anyone who was sitting on the fence in libya maybe thinking well let's
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:00.600]  let's hold our finger up uh to the point and see which way the wind is blowing now sees
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:06.040]  it going in khaddafi's favor and i think uh he's he's got it renewed support and that's why
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:12.360]  mccain is panicking that's why senator carrey's panicking uh did you see the senator carry video
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:18.040]  clip today where he said none of us want military intervention or military action and we all agree
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:22.840]  that shouldn't happen that's why we should only bomb their airfields and have a no fly zone
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:29.000]  which is not a military action right i saw that and you know i mean you look at carrie and mccain
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:34.200]  and lindsay grand these guys who uh you know are talking about military action well why don't they
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:39.720]  suit up and go over there you know i mean if you know let the king get into a uh an f4 yeah but
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:45.480]  what about the what about the orwellian statement that that that bombing airfields and no fly zones
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:50.440]  are not military action well of course they are and uh you know we have a a pass with the reagan
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:55.880]  administration when he he launched the tax on libya and uh you know khaddafi's daughter was killed
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:45:02.840]  in one of those uh attacks and this place i think this place in the khaddafi's hands uh uh especially
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:10.040]  with the the Saudi connection because uh he now has some credentials to say look we know who the
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:15.640]  Saudis have backed at south kaeda and and now they're talking about putting Saudi personnel and weapons
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:21.400]  in here and uh and uh i think uh we're gonna probably see him gain some support because
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:26.600]  some people in libya will say look we don't like khaddafi's been around for 42 years we're tired of
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:32.520]  him he's a dictator but darn it he's our he's our dictator and when they see western intervention
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:39.160]  that plays into libyan nationalism and that and that is khaddafi's strong card yeah okay uh shifting
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:43.320]  gears what are some of the big stories you've been working on wane that aren't dealing with
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:49.720]  the situation in the middle east well this whole thing i've been looking at for for quite a few
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:55.480]  months about uh uh the history of obama and his family i really believe the birth certificate thing
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:46:00.760]  is that is a diversion i think the white house loves uh people to talk about that even carl
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:08.120]  roe said that i think the real issue is uh obama's uh passed with the the central intelligence
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:14.760]  agency his mother uh his stepfather in indonesia his grandmother and grandfather in hawaii and
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:21.160]  his uh alleged father barack senior out of kenya that is the look the more i look into this it's
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:32.280]  quite clear that uh both uh and uh dunham satoro obama whatever whatever her name it was uh was
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:39.000]  a uh flexible uh agent uh for the central intelligence agency and it it's quite clear
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:48.600]  that obama with all these uh the these fields on his um uh college transcripts and and other
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:54.520]  parts of his record that he was also uh parading around as a marxist at occidental in columbia
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:59.640]  when in fact he looks like he was part of the renewed operation chaos which had been
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:05.160]  done away with after the watergate scandal but when reagan got in he not only renewed operation
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:11.880]  chaos for domestic surveillance of certain groups but expanded it even beyond uh what it was uh what
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:18.600]  when it was uh under the johnson and next to the administration now what's the latest on the mafia
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:24.680]  situation going on there in chicago i saw a lot of even mainstream news articles about election
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:31.240]  fraud going on in in the city famous for that and rama manuel being put in there to i guess
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:38.520]  keep all the bodies buried well of course he got the magic 55 percent in the election and we know
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:45.560]  uh historically in chicago uh they always uh can rely on the graveyard vote to get their
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:52.600]  favorite candidate in in the office and um uh it's quite clear that uh even even with his
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:57.640]  transition came he's already had to have he already had one lady resigned because of an
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:03.240]  ethics scandal i think this is the beginning of many many major ethics scandals the problem in
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:09.400]  chicago is the chicago tribune and the fun times have gutted their investigative news staff and
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:15.080]  and and so there's really other than uh some enterprising internet journalists in chicago
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:21.560]  there's not much in the way of any media coverage of of what we're going to see now with um manuel
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:31.400]  uh just not only continuing the daily machine but uh making it much worse as far as the corruption
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:37.080]  in that city right he's going to try to bring casino gambling into chicago this is something
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:42.920]  that rod blagojevic was opposed to we've got the second blagojevic trial coming up in april
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:49.000]  i noticed that patrick fitzgerald the prosecutor dropped some charges against blagojevic i'm
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:55.160]  just wondering uh whether they're nervous about what might happen during a second blagojevic
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:49:02.200]  trial if the judge who's pretty dirty james aigle uh if he allows any sort of testimony especially
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:08.920]  from those phone calls between uh blagojevic and his people and rama manuel uh they may want to
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:15.080]  bury this um this this prosecution i think they're pretty nervous just merely because they've dropped
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:21.240]  some of the charges against blagojevic where do you see things going for barack obama into the
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:27.640]  2012 election well he's there obviously there's a lot of people upset especially in wisconsin uh
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:34.120]  they didn't see uh him uh did providing any sort of bully pulpit against the governor there uh what
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:40.920]  he's trying to do uh similarly in ohio and new jersey now remember these are states that obama
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:47.400]  won if he's if he loses union support if he loses the support of the blue collar what we have left
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:54.360]  the blue collar people in this country anyway uh i think uh he we may see a challenger uh now
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:59.880]  because cindy said he's not interested but he also said that that maybe there should be a challenger
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:07.080]  uh i think uh basically obama is going to ride probably ride into reelection because the republicans
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:13.320]  won't put up anybody uh who people will like especially those in the center the tea party people
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:19.000]  might like them but that's that's that's it uh but i i would not be surprised to see somebody
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:25.080]  make noise because well let's face it in about five to six months we're going to start seeing
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:31.400]  primary politics start and uh caucus politics start i i would not be surprised i i don't know who
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:37.160]  this person uh could be uh i know howard dean said he's not interested but whatever they say now
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:42.280]  isn't what they're going to do in the future um uh but i i think one thing we can rule out is the
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:48.120]  hillary clinton challenge i thought she might there was noise uh bill clinton was the approaching
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:53.160]  people the for for financial support but i think her her trader is pretty much over well
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:58.200]  wane madson wane madson report dot com our sites info wars dot com wane thanks for joining us
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:04.040]  your phone call straight ahead hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:09.000]  storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:13.800]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds that all
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:18.360]  perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:23.640]  so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:29.560]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:33.880]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified

[01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:04.600]  have you ever consumed protein powder supplements i have and all of them don't taste that good
[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:07.600]  have artificial flavors, sweeteners, or unhealthy sugars.
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:11.600]  About a year ago, I was introduced to a new protein powder that changed my experience.
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:17.600]  This protein powder made me feel noticeably better, and it tasted more delicious than any drink I've ever had.
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:20.600]  Here's the experience of one satisfied user named Rich.
[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:23.600]  The term best of all worlds has been belabored to death,
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:29.600]  and yet I've just discovered a whey protein powder that truly deserves to be called best of all worlds,
[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:33.600]  best taste by far, best results by far.
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:38.600]  You almost feel like you're cheating that something that tastes that good could be so good for you.
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:40.600]  Thank you, Steven, and cocoon nutrition.
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:45.600]  One World Whey truly is the best of all worlds, the only way for me.
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:54:13.600]  You're truly rich from Georgia. Real users, real happy.
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:16.600]  You know, I'm under the weather today, so I'm a little bit slow,
[01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:20.600]  but we've got near-record internet stream listeners.
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:25.600]  Just illustrating that the listeners are putting up with me, and I appreciate that.
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:30.600]  But we are covering some of the most important issues out there in the world,
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:37.600]  and that's my only desire is to be able to really get these points across in ways that are easily understood
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:48.600]  to not just our regular listeners, but to all the new listeners that we have tuning in on a routine basis.
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:52.600]  The world is going crazy.
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:55:00.600]  There is a powerful group of globalists who want to destroy our infrastructure
[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:04.600]  and reduce us to absolute serfdom.
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:12.600]  Now, I'm going to go to Patrick and Steve and Dana and Bill and Mary ahead of Max Keiser joining us,
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:14.600]  coming up a little bit into the next hour.
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:22.600]  I've also got a bunch of Twitter questions here.
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:24.600]  A lot of great questions here from Twitter.
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:33.600]  Like, why is the EPA considering regulating dust, yet quite all right with toxins in the air, water, and food?
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:38.600]  I'll answer that after Max Keiser leaves us.
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:39.600]  Here's another one.
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:44.600]  Please talk about the U.S.-Canada secret merger signed February 4, 2011.
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:46.600]  Well, that's not secret.
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:53.600]  That was the consummation of the SPP agreement for the continuity, continental security zone.
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:58.600]  But actually, guys, print me an article about Obama signs, continental security zone.
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:01.600]  So when I answer that question, I'll have the proof, thanks.
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:06.600]  A bunch of really good questions here that I'll get to after Max leaves us.
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:11.600]  He's just on with us for 20 minutes, and we'll finish up with calls and Twitter questions.
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:14.600]  Twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:19.600]  If you want to follow us there, we're going to start adding more information to that daily.
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:23.600]  Photos, inside info on who's coming up on the show, your questions.
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:26.600]  Twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones.
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:32.600]  Don't forget, this radio broadcast is also listener supported,
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:37.600]  and we have the online video bookstore at infowars.com, where you can get the new book.
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:42.600]  The only place you can get it, Big Brother, the Orwellian Nightmare Come True by Mark Dice.
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:48.600]  Films like What in the World Are They Spring, Documenting the Chemtrails, Invisible Empire,
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:51.600]  New Lord Defined, Covering the Whole Globalist Infrastructure.
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:56.600]  All these books and videos are absolutely key to not just informing yourself to a higher level,
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:58.600]  but informing those around you.
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:04.600]  So infowars.com, or 888-253-33139.
[01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:07.600]  And everything we do here, again, is possible because of your support.
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:12.600]  We have the great You Are the Resistance fee for Victory t-shirts that are very popular.
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:18.600]  We have the draft Ron Paul 2012 shirts that as soon as he announces, we're going to stop selling them.
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:23.600]  So those are limited edition, obviously available at infowars.com.
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:26.600]  Patrick in Illinois, you're on the year. Welcome.
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:31.600]  Hi, Alex. I was wondering if you heard this new song by Lupe Tiesco.
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:36.600]  It's called Words I Never Said, and talks about 9-11, Building 7.
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:40.600]  All this crazy stuff you wouldn't think would be in this song.
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:44.600]  Also, there's a new game coming out, the Ace.
[01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:50.600]  It's called Homefront, and it's got mass graves, and it's crazy.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:55.600]  People are already being bulldozed into mass graves in these concentration camps.
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:58:03.600]  You know, one of my crew was talking about Homefront video game and similar things this morning.
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:10.600]  So most of these new video games are about you invading America, mass graves, mass death,
[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:15.600]  but then in reality, the police are secretly being trained for this.
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:18.600]  So it deals with mass graves here in America?
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:22.600]  No, I don't know where it was, but it looked like there were American troops,
[01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:25.600]  and it was not safe coming up on banners and the walls and stuff.
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:29.600]  Yeah, for some reason, your phone, I'm having trouble understanding much of what you're saying.
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:31.600]  Call us back when you've got a better phone, Patrick.
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:36.600]  Phone quality overall in America is going down because everybody's on IP phones,
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:41.600]  and I couldn't understand a word or two of that.
[01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:50.600]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:54.600]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:58:54.600 --> 01:58:58.600]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company,
[01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:00.600]  a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:04.600]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:07.600]  how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:12.600]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:17.600]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091,
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:21.600]  or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:25.600]  Let's talk to the owner of 5-star soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:31.600]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me,
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:36.600]  how's business? I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:42.600]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:45.600]  Visit our website, 5starsoap.com,
[01:59:45.600 --> 02:00:01.600]  to find a one-to-two-month soap sampler. Thank you.
[02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:23.600]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:29.600]  All right, Kaiser's popping in for two segments to his final report from the Middle East for us.
[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:33.600]  We are live. It is Monday, the 7th day of March, 2011.
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:42.600]  We're going to go to Steve, Dana, Bill, Mary, Bobby, and others.
[02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:49.600]  I've got a bunch of really informative, very good questions that came in on Twitter.
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:52.600]  We're going to answer some more of the questions as well coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:57.600]  Twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones. If you want to follow us there, there's the site.
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:02.600]  Let's go ahead and jam in a caller too before Kaiser comes on with us.
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:06.600]  Let's talk to Steven Illinois, Steven on the air.
[02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:09.600]  Hello, Alex. I'm a first-time caller and a big supporter.
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:19.600]  I'm also a musician under the name SDM, who have written and recorded songs influenced by the topics you discuss that reach thousands on the Internet.
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:20.600]  Well done.
[02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:22.600]  I wanted to ask you, what's that?
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:24.600]  Well done.
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:33.600]  But I wanted to ask you if you saw the band Muse performing the song The Resistance on the Grammys.
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:40.600]  I did see a clip of it online where they had like SWAT teams and riot police coming after them, right?
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:43.600]  Yeah, it was awesome. I couldn't believe they let them do it.
[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:54.600]  Well, I'll tell you, Muse, Bellamy, the only links they've got on their official website to news are infowars.com, prisonplanted.com, and propagandamatrix.com.
[02:01:54.600 --> 02:01:58.600]  It's Watson's mirror of prison planet.
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:07.600]  And I've got Bellamy on. He's a big fan. And then I was so stupid, I only had the Austin number, which was just the cell phone of his Austin helper.
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:12.600]  And I cannot get through their management, which is fine. I don't even care, whatever.
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:18.600]  But I know that Muse are fans of the show, and that is certainly exciting.
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:23.600]  I did talk to Dave Mustaine this weekend. He's going to be coming back on the show.
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:27.600]  Dave gave me a call. I want to say hi to Dave and his wife. They're listening.
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:33.600]  So he's going to be back on the show. But there's so many prominent media people that do know what's going on.
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:42.600]  Yeah, Dave's awesome. But I just want to thank you for everything you do and have done, and I will continue my fight in the info war.
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:43.600]  So God bless you.
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:47.600]  Well, I appreciate that, Steve. Let me ask you a question.
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:52.600]  You know, when you've been sick a few days and you're almost well, you think you're, you know, ready to go back to work.
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:58.600]  But I have been a little bit punch-drunk today. Do you think I should have sat it out today or has the show been okay?
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:00.600]  Oh, show's been great.
[02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:03.600]  Okay. Well, thanks for putting up with me because my brain's not working.
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:06.600]  I'm constantly saying something and having to think for the answer.
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:11.600]  I feel fine, but my brain feels, you know how it feels.
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:16.600]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dana in New York here on the air. Thanks for holding.
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:21.600]  Hey, Alex, I appreciate it. Thanks for taking my call. Wishing you a speedy and full recovery.
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:27.600]  My question is in regard to the Federal Reserve.
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:33.600]  I recently saw a movie, a video by Clint Richardson, a We Are Change member in Utah.
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:43.600]  The movie was Corporation Nation, and he expounds on Walter Berrien's work and your work on the Comprehensive Financial Annual Report.
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:48.600]  And he raises a question at the end of that video that I wanted to put out to you.
[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:57.600]  As a private corporation, the Federal Reserve is required to issue a Comprehensive Financial Report.
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:05.600]  Wouldn't a review of that report serve the same purpose as an audit of the Fed?
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:09.600]  Yes, it would have a similar effect.
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:16.600]  But again, it took us decades to just get the public to realize we have a private Federal Reserve running the country,
[02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:24.600]  and much less get them to realize that there's double sets of books for the school district, water districts, counties, cities, states, every federal agency.
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:36.600]  And again, in the last 50 years, 50-plus years, most of those investments that were off budget were put basically into the foreign banks
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:41.600]  and have now been stolen through derivatives. So a lot of that is gone.
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:49.600]  Because isn't enough for the globalists don't want to make you rich. They want to create bubbles so they can consolidate power,
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:56.600]  then pop the bubbles, then they're the only ones with money that can come back in and buy up everything else for pennies on the dollar.
[02:04:56.600 --> 02:05:00.600]  We'll be right back. Good question.
[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:08.600]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions,
[02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:16.600]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:05:16.600 --> 02:05:21.600]  My name is Mario Safaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:26.600]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:34.600]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:05:34.600 --> 02:05:42.600]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:52.600]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:05:52.600 --> 02:06:00.600]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:05.600]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:09.600]  1. New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:16.600]  2. Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true.
[02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:21.600]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:29.600]  3. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:36.600]  4. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:41.600]  5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.

[02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:08.600]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:26.600]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:36.600]  Okay, so this weekend I was sent a clip of Max Kaiser in Cairo and with a very satisfied,
[02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:41.600]  satiated look in his eye as if he was giving me the holy grail.
[02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:47.600]  He walks over to some guy in the square and says, tell Alex Jones your message.
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:54.600]  And the guy says, Alex, it was not just people from Facebook here in the square.
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:56.600]  The revolution was real.
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:09:06.600]  And then Kaiser with a very satisfied look says see Alex that we could probably even play that ridiculous clip.
[02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:12.600]  I guess implying that I'm saying none of this rebellion is real.
[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:18.600]  No, I know that it's caused because of dollar devaluation worldwide.
[02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:24.600]  And so it cost more for these people making on average $2 a day or less to buy their food.
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:29.600]  But I also know that they sent albarity in two weeks before this implosion began.
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:34.600]  I said three weeks ago that there would be SAS commandos inside Libya.
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:36.600]  Watson wrote about it 12 days ago.
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:38.600]  Now it's confirmed.
[02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:52.600]  What five months ago, Lindsay Williams on this radio show said his big oil company exec source told him that they would destabilize the Middle East order out of chaos.
[02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:59.600]  So I'm not saying that there aren't people rebelling in Ireland and Greece and here in the U.S. against austerity.
[02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:02.600]  I'm saying it's being steered and controlled.
[02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:14.600]  So it's more of a nuanced issue and it's not even nuanced, but I guess it would be called nuanced for some that there's multifaceted things going on here.
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:22.600]  Obviously Saudi Arabia is having demonstrations all over it.
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:27.600]  So there's a lot of things happening here, but the question is why is it starting now?
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:37.600]  Now he just got back from his week long visit in the Middle East and to give us any final reports on that from Paris is Max Kaiser.
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:38.600]  Max, good to have you with us.
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:39.600]  Hey, Alex Jones.
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:41.600]  Yeah, we were gone for two weeks.
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:43.600]  We were in Beirut and then Cairo.
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:51.600]  And yeah, we did that report from Tire Square, which was made famous from all the reports from the revolution at Cairo.
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:57.600]  And yeah, I found some people actually about Alex Jones.
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:04.600]  Your name is known amongst the revolutionaries in Egypt and in Cairo, which I was surprised to hear.
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:10.600]  Because after we did that clip talking to that guy in the square, people were like, Alex Jones, Alex Jones.
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:12.600]  They thought you were there.
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:14.600]  They were looking for you.
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:16.600]  But I said, no, no, it's just me.
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:18.600]  Just me, Max Kaiser.
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:20.600]  They seemed disappointed.
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:23.600]  Well, they just don't know how good you are, Max.
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:28.600]  Max, I'm not saying that Hazin Mubarak wasn't evil and there wasn't a hunger to overthrow him.
[02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:35.600]  All I'm saying is now they've put in one of his generals, one of his adjuncts, is in control there.
[02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:36.600]  But I mean, I...
[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:38.600]  But confirming what...
[02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:52.600]  His number two took over, then he resigned and now this new guy, they actually put a new guy in yesterday, as Wayne Madsen was talking about in his interview.
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:54.600]  And he made some really good points.
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:59.600]  He talked about the fact that they have put in now a new prime minister that the people are happy with.
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:02.600]  If this guy doesn't perform, then they're going to demand another prize.
[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:04.600]  No, no, that's what you said last week.
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:05.600]  So you're right.
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:10.600]  In fact, here's Reuters, knives, petrol bombs, return to Cairo streets.
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:24.600]  And it says that men with plain clothes, armed with swords and petrol bombs, attack protesters in Cairo on Sunday night during a demonstration demanding reform of security services with a reputation for brutality,
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:25.600]  witnesses said.
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:41.600]  So this clearly shows the security services are in plain clothes attacking the peaceful demonstrators, which does show that somebody in the government, I mean, these corrupt mafia security services, want to try to get the public back in line.
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:42.600]  Right.
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:50.600]  The security services, the secret police, what happened on Sunday and on Saturday is that the protesters who stormed a lot of these government buildings,
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:59.600]  they stormed into the Secret Service area building where they do all the torture, you know, America outsources its torture to Egypt.
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:01.600]  And one of those locations is in Cairo.
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:05.600]  And so the public stormed in there and they started ripping the place apart.
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:14.600]  And they found a lot of the Secret Service guys are trying desperately to shred documents ahead of the protesters coming in and getting all the videotapes.
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:24.600]  They found videotapes with apparently Mubarak's regime had videotapes of famous Egyptian people and celebrities and compromising sex scandals and all this.
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:25.600]  Wow.
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:26.600]  Yeah.
[02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:28.600]  So they tell us more about that.
[02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:36.600]  So, so, so certainly, certainly then the global assault revolution coming, they tried to control it, but they're not able to control it.
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:37.600]  Yeah.
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:40.600]  I mean, look at how the rebels backing up what you're saying.
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:42.600]  I'm just trying to throw up both perspectives here.
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:50.600]  Look at how the rebels, even against Qaddafi, didn't want the SAS's help and have grabbed the British troops.
[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:51.600]  Yeah.
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:14:01.600]  Well, in Cairo, you know, which I think is a very interesting situation of all of the countries in revolt right now, because it's a very well educated population.
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:09.600]  And they are really got their head screwed on straight in terms of wanting to write a new constitution.
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:15.600]  They're trying to pressure the government, obviously they demonstrated that they can put in a new government if they want to.
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:22.600]  But yeah, the secret police, the guys who are, they're now looking to arrest the secret police and to prosecute the secret police.
[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:30.600]  So the secret police that are still hanging around are, you know, they're panicking and they're out there trying to cause mayhem.
[02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:39.600]  And the size of the protest and the knowledge base of the protestors who are using the social media to exchange, when I was in Cairo just last night, Alex, I'm in Paris now.
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:43.600]  I just arrived here three hours ago from my hotel room in Cairo.
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:56.600]  I was following the Twitter stream, the Twitter stream of protesters swapping information about where the secret police were, what they're doing, who do we send over there to swarm them, you know, flash mob, take them, you know, surround them.
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:15:01.600]  They're just using the tool of Twitter in real time. I was watching it from one of the buildings they said was on fire.
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:13.600]  I could see the smoke from my hotel room and I could watch the interaction between social media, Twitter, the activists and their desire to overthrow the corrupt government and all the secret police really in real time.
[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:24.600]  Well, what you just said, for those that don't know, is confirmed here by Reuters that the demonstrators have been breaking in to the Interior Ministry's facilities that serve as a domestic spy agency.
[02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:30.600]  So basically the public's breaking in to the threat fusion centers, the spying torture centers.
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:38.600]  Yep, yep, yep. And of course, we know under the Bush administration that they outsourced through what they call extraordinary rendition.
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:47.600]  They sent prisoners, I did a film for this, Roger Zehra, about a guy named Abu Omar who they kidnapped in Milan, Italy and sent to a torture center in Egypt.
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:16:03.600]  And they got busted by the Italian police because the Italian police, because of the drug laws and anti-drug laws are so harsh and fierce that they foolishly went in violation of the Italian police and it triggers an immediate investigation that goes around the government
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:21.600]  because they carved this out to fight the coast of Nostra there. And this set up a situation where the CIA was revealed to have spent five to six hundred thousand dollars on a luxury hotel in Milan and Venice pursuing this guy, Abu Omar, to put him on a flight to Egypt for torture.
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:36.600]  It was an Italian national that they suspected of bad things. And so anyway, these extraordinary rendition flights, there's an excellent book on this called Ghost Plains from a guy I interviewed in this film talking about all the unmarked planes that are out.
[02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:42.600]  Well, one of the CIA Ghost Plains crashed a few years ago with three and a half tons of pure cocaine in Mexico.
[02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:54.600]  Yeah, exactly. So they broke into this torture center. There's a few of them in the country. They're gathering information. They're getting all this information. They're going to make public this information.
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:17:04.600]  But yeah, the few guys that are still left, they're being pursued by the new activists that seem to be prosecuted and brought to justice when they have a justice system in place.
[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:20.600]  They're panicking. And I don't give them good odds of being successful. These protesters in Egypt in Cairo, in my opinion, is really the nerve center for the entire what even Wayne Madsen said in your previous interview.
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:28.600]  He talked about this global revolution. You know, we've been talking about it on your show, the global insurrection against banker occupation.
[02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:37.600]  It is a global event. And I think in Wisconsin, they're revolting against their corrupt dictator, Scott Walker.
[02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:48.600]  And I really am surprised that the people who are protesting against Scott Walker and fighting the protesters don't understand that everyone is involved here.
[02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:55.600]  You're either part of the kleptocracy of Scott Walker or you're a peasant. It's not about right, left, neoliberal, conservative.
[02:17:55.600 --> 02:18:03.600]  You're either all peasant. Everyone living in Wisconsin is a peasant. If you're not Scott Walker, everyone living in Ohio, in Illinois, in New York, in California.
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:12.600]  If you're not on the Goldman Sachs partner list, you're a peasant. And it is a peasant's revolt in Wisconsin, just like it's a peasant's revolt in Cairo.
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:16.600]  But it's a peasant's revolt armed with technology and social media.
[02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:29.600]  You know, have the revolutionaries in France, where I am now in Paris 200 and something years ago, revolted back then and they had these tools available, they would be using these tools for the same reason to fight the same corrupt bankers for the same reason.
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:31.600]  So history repeats itself. It's just a technology.
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:52.600]  Well, to be clear, though, Max, I agree with you that, I mean, it's a fact that if you've got $1,500 trillion in derivatives that Scott Walker and the governor in New Jersey, not just Wisconsin, saying, let's cut unions bargaining, that's going to fix the economy.
[02:18:52.600 --> 02:18:55.600]  I mean, that is literally a joke.
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:19:03.600]  Yeah, because the people, you know, the only thing about all these union folks, government union folks are getting a sweet deal.
[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:10.600]  Well, look at it the other way around and ask yourself, why are the people who are not getting that sweet deal getting a sweet deal?
[02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:18.600]  In other words, why should the people who are not getting a good deal be fighting the people who are workers and getting a good deal?
[02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:24.600]  Shouldn't they all be fighting for a good deal against the people who stole their money, including Scott Walker and the corrupt bankers?
[02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:32.600]  But what I was going to say, Max, and we'll come back and talk more about this, is that, yes, it's a scapegoat to go after the unions.
[02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:49.600]  But when you have statements by Michael Moore about anybody's money in America is a natural resource and belongs to everybody else, it's the image of the government coming and taking middle-class people's money to then give it to the unions.
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:20:01.600]  And that's the issue. So it's the big banksters playing the unions off against the middle class when we should be together against the banksters, then we can fight it out later amongst ourselves.

[02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:37.600]  When you have government unions always pushing for more, more, more, more, more and having cops out there revenue generating for their own pensions.
[02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:48.600]  That's the other side and that's why somebody like Governor Walker looks legitimate to conservatives because he's saying, oh look, middle class, the unions are robbing you.
[02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:56.600]  My point is the big mega banks have set up this architecture and you could get rid of all the unions, all the pension funds.
[02:24:56.600 --> 02:25:04.600]  It still wouldn't pay a fraction of the derivatives that this country signed on to. That's my point. Here's Michael Moore.
[02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:13.600]  This country is not broke. State of Wisconsin is not broke. There's a ton of cash in this country. Trillions of dollars of it.
[02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:25.600]  But it's a finite amount. There is only so much cash. What's happened is that we've allowed a vast majority of that cash to be concentrated in the hands of just a few people.
[02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:31.600]  And they're not circulating that cash. If you don't believe that, go try and get a loan right now. They're sitting on the money.
[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:39.600]  They're using it for their own, they're putting it someplace else. They have no interest in helping you with your life, with that money.
[02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:49.600]  We've allowed them to take that. That's not theirs. That's a national resource. That's ours. We all have this. We all benefit from this or we all suffer.
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:59.600]  So it's a natural resource. Now, what he said was partially true. The bankers have gotten the $28 trillion plus, hoarded it for themselves.
[02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:10.600]  If they do give you loans, some credit card loans, APR are now $79.9. Last time I checked it was $69. Now it's $79. In fact, they won't believe that.
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:21.600]  Put up the CNN for me. Show them that. So yeah, that's true. But the person that gets taxed is Alex Jones.
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:28.600]  And then you do have these arrogant government workers who think they're God. That's the point I'm making, Max Geiser.
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:37.600]  Well, you bring up a few points. First of all, I'm not in Michael Moore's camp, never have been, because he's not financially literate.
[02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:46.600]  Ron Paul is financially literate, and he makes great statements about why we should get rid of the CIA and other things, because it's a complete waste of money.
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:52.600]  But Michael Moore, when he talks about capitalism or financial markets, he's obviously illiterate on these subjects.
[02:26:52.600 --> 02:27:00.600]  He's shown capitalism a love story, tries to be critical of capitalism, but never really describes anything having to do with the capitalist system.
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:14.600]  He is simply a guy who is playing into his very limited understanding of these issues, and then building a polemic around this limited understanding.
[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:21.600]  And he has great support amongst a lot of people, but his underlying points don't make any economic sense.
[02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:28.600]  Now, in the case of Wisconsin, the way I would differentiate my views in terms of why I think there's a regime change necessary,
[02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:40.600]  Scott Walker should go, and that the union worker should not be vilified, is because the problem inherently is not the concentration of capital or concentration of wealth,
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:43.600]  and the problem is not that we need wealth redistribution.
[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:51.600]  The problem, looking at it from the point of view of the fact that the American economy has been financialized over the past 30 years,
[02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:55.600]  that is to say most of the profits come from Wall Street and the financialization.
[02:27:55.600 --> 02:28:03.600]  It's been turned into a paper fiat fraud derivative counterfeit system, not a true...
[02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:04.600]  Right.
[02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:09.600]  Keeping that in mind, it's not about redistributing wealth, it's about redistributing risk.
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:19.600]  And by redistributing risk, you can effect a more egalitarian economy by getting rid of the moral hazard,
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:26.600]  by getting rid of the fact that when bankers make mistakes, they get rewarded, applying real risk for the real...
[02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:34.600]  Yeah, they've got a rigged game like it's a casino, as you always say, where the house always wins.
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:36.600]  I mean, it's a rigged game.
[02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:38.600]  This is not capitalism.
[02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:42.600]  This is a fascist fraud that we're living in.
[02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:44.600]  The casino analogy is a good one.
[02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:47.600]  In America, the house always wins.
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:52.600]  And that's the casino gulag mentality, and it's completely wrong.
[02:28:52.600 --> 02:29:00.600]  What you need in a good working capitalist, free market society is you need to have equal risk and equal reward.
[02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:05.600]  If someone's going to take a risk, and if they lose, they're penalized.
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:10.600]  And then that creates a certain creative destruction, as it's called in economic circles.
[02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:16.600]  And people are challenging themselves to take risks and be entrepreneurial and create jobs.
[02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:25.600]  But right now, the risk is borne by the 99% of the population that can't afford to take the risk.
[02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:32.600]  And all the rewards are sucked up by that top 1%, who's got the political clout to channel all the reward into their pockets.
[02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:37.600]  And every time they make it bad, bad, they get the government to impose those starting measures on the population.
[02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:41.600]  That's the issue that I think is at the heart of all of the underlying economic issues.
[02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:44.600]  Tell you what, finish up on the other side. This is important.
[02:29:44.600 --> 02:29:50.600]  Finish up on this definition issue.
[02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:54.600]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.600 --> 02:29:58.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:08.600]  Alex has told you that the mid-east uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:11.600]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:20.600]  Ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[02:30:20.600 --> 02:30:28.600]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[02:30:28.600 --> 02:30:33.600]  Move quickly while you can still afford it, and E-Foods Direct will pay your shipping costs for you.

[02:31:04.600 --> 02:31:09.600]  Terany is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:12.600]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:12.600 --> 02:31:17.600]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:24.600]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:24.600 --> 02:31:30.600]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:34.600]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:31:34.600 --> 02:31:41.600]  Repair to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship, bodies cameras, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:44.600]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:44.600 --> 02:31:48.600]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[02:31:48.600 --> 02:31:51.600]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[02:32:58.600 --> 02:33:02.600]  Thank you.
[02:33:02.600 --> 02:33:07.600]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[02:33:07.600 --> 02:33:11.600]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:29.600]  I got a bunch of really important questions that you guys sent in via twitter.com.
[02:33:29.600 --> 02:33:33.600]  Your phone calls are coming up here in a few minutes as well.
[02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:43.600]  But Max, finishing up, because I agree with the economic analysis you're giving, of what a true free market system is,
[02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:51.600]  versus what we have now, which is a rigged financial terrorist predatory consolidation system,
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:59.600]  then the big bankers openly fund communism and socialism as a way to then give a false alternative to the public,
[02:33:59.600 --> 02:34:05.600]  who then run away from the bankers and call for socialism, which then only communalizes the wealth,
[02:34:05.600 --> 02:34:09.600]  which only allows the bankers to steal it even that much more easily.
[02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:16.600]  Well, socialism buying for the bankers, because they get the government to pay them a huge annual bonus and salary.
[02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:22.600]  They are living in a socialist world. Everyone else is forced to live in a capitalist world, at what's left.
[02:34:22.600 --> 02:34:31.600]  But they just finalize that point. By the way, Alex, you know, you got to play my clip from Russia today, my two minute clip.
[02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:37.600]  I don't know why you're delaying on this, but this is a fantastic clip, but I sent Max. You should play that clip.
[02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:50.600]  But anyway, getting to my point, with this Wisconsin debate, the people who are attacking the public sector union are helping the Koch brother.
[02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:58.600]  So you have to ask yourself, which is a bigger leech, Omni-Wisconsin and the national economy, the Koch brothers, or the government union?
[02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:06.600]  The answer, obviously, is the Koch brothers, because they're tied into the New World Order. The Union people are just a sideshow.
[02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:14.600]  So what I'm saying is, attack the person that needs to be attacked, the Koch brothers, Scott Walker and the New World Order and the Kleptocrats,
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:22.600]  and organize with these Union people to push back in a Cairo-like revolution, instead of fighting amongst yourselves, because you're just going to end up as powerful.
[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:32.600]  No, but that's what they're doing, is the banksters are trying to get us to fight with each other over the crumbs, instead of changing the overall architecture of the system.
[02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:39.600]  Agreed. I'm totally in agreement. And Michael Moore doesn't understand that, in my opinion, because he doesn't see the connection to the Koch brothers.
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:45.600]  He doesn't understand the way finance works, and he's an economic illiterate. That's why he makes a great filmmaker.
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:53.600]  I thought Bowling for Columbine was a fantastic film, but when it comes to economics, he's tone deaf. He doesn't know anything that he's talking about.
[02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:58.600]  Well, Max, you don't agree with victim disarmament, do you?
[02:35:58.600 --> 02:36:00.600]  What does that mean?
[02:36:00.600 --> 02:36:03.600]  Restricting the Second Amendment.
[02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:23.600]  Oh, well, as I said on your show before, Alex Jones, the Second Amendment, as it was iterated in the Constitution by the Founding Fathers, is there for a specific reason, which would be if the White House had taken over by tyrant, if you recall.
[02:36:23.600 --> 02:36:25.600]  That's why they put that in there.
[02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:32.600]  Yeah, imagine what would happen if the Egyptians would have firearms, then the secret police couldn't be running roughshod over them.
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:39.600]  Well, they don't need firearms, and there's two points there. First of all, in the Egyptians, there's no leaders and there's no violence.
[02:36:39.600 --> 02:36:46.600]  So like a Gandhi-esque revolution, and by the way, people thought that could never happen again, but here we're seeing it in Cairo. You don't need weapons.
[02:36:46.600 --> 02:37:06.600]  So getting back to your point in the U.S., well, I've said on your show now, two years ago, if that Second Amendment is there for a reason, and it's supposed to be triggered by certain events, then I have to ask you and your listeners, what exactly are, you know, I mean, isn't the events foretold by the Founding Fathers?
[02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:12.600]  Haven't they come to pass? I mean, what's the deal here? I mean, you just, you like to...
[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:16.600]  Max, that's easy for you. You've bugged out over there to Paris.
[02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:21.600]  I am part of the Internet revolution. My influence. Look at what happened at Stover Price.
[02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:23.600]  I know. Listen, I'm out of time.
[02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:25.600]  Now it's a 36 and a half.
[02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:27.600]  Max, Max, I'm out of time.
[02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:35.600]  I'm here for my kitchen at Paris. Do you know how many people have become rich? And the revolution has been financed because of what we're saying right here. That's the revolution, my friend.
[02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:43.600]  No, no, I fully hear you, Max, and I appreciate you joining us. Max Kaiser will talk to you again soon.
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:58.600]  Max sent us this video clip that is on his TV show coming up in a few days. It hasn't aired yet from Cairo talking about the big European British banks laundering Gaddafi's money.
[02:37:58.600 --> 02:38:03.600]  So since he wants me to play this, I will play it, but I've got to get to your questions or I'll never get to your calls.
[02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:11.600]  And I've got some economic news I want to hit something I covered two weeks ago and that I then didn't cover last week.
[02:38:11.600 --> 02:38:20.600]  Guys, you have that CBS clip with the ATF agent saying that he was ordered to let machine guns and things into Mexico.
[02:38:20.600 --> 02:38:30.600]  Find that for tomorrow because I want to lead with that. This is a lot of times there's big major stories that I barely mentioned, but it's been confirmed.
[02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:35.600]  And we already saw this coming. In fact, I already said this two years ago, but now it's confirmed.
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:54.600]  Obama all over the U.S. has ordered through Holder, the Attorney General, to allow illegal guns to be shipped out of the U.S. into Mexico so they can call for restricting the Second Amendment here because of what's happening in Mexico.
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:39:14.600]  And you've now seen them call for making gun dealers report guns that they sell the ATF or restricting what guns they sell or how many guns they can sell outside of law in the name of stopping the situation in Mexico when they have a total gun ban down there.
[02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:36.600]  But the issue here is, you know, have whistleblowers from inside the ATF confirming the government's trying to ensure more guns get down there so they can then trace them back to the United States and demonize the Second Amendment when the lion's share of the guns the Mexican cartels are using are being bought from the Mexican military.
[02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:47.600]  But here's an example of false flag. In fact, a week and a half ago I sent these articles to Watson and Kurt. I know they're busy guys, but I said please write a story on this.
[02:39:47.600 --> 02:39:59.600]  The headline should be Obama caught in false flag, Obama caught shipping guns to Mexico in Second Amendment false flag, something like that.
[02:39:59.600 --> 02:40:06.600]  I mean, here they are red handed. Where are the congressional hearings? Where are the investigations?
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:20.600]  One big thing that we have going against us here is that so much is happening and going on now that in the past maybe one of these articles I would have harped on it for three hours.
[02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:27.600]  Now there's so much incredible tyranny proving everything we've said that I don't even cover half of it.
[02:40:27.600 --> 02:40:35.600]  All right. Here's the clip from a Max Keiser's TV show. This hasn't aired yet. This hasn't been seen yet.
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:38.600]  And so he was harping on it. Here it is.
[02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:43.600]  The dictator's dough, astonishing wealth of Qaddafi and his family revealed.
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:53.600]  The astonishing wealth of Libyan tyrant Momar Qaddafi and his family has been laid bare as countries around the world begin freezing billions of dollars worth of their assets.
[02:40:53.600 --> 02:41:04.600]  The U.S. alone has seized 30 billion dollars while Canada has frozen 2.4 billion, Austria 1.7 billion and the U.K. 1 billion.
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:09.600]  And that money came in after the Patriot Act. A lot of it did.
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:10.600]  All of it, yeah.
[02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:16.600]  During a period of supposedly these new anti-money laundering money for dictators laws.
[02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:23.600]  So here you have selective prosecution and a two-tier legal system. If you're a dictator like Qaddafi, we'll take your money.
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:27.600]  We don't care who you kill. The name of America's doughnut franchises.
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:37.600]  But if you're a hardworking American, we treat you like garbage. We treat you like scum because we think you should be working as slaves on our Wall Street plantations.
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:40.600]  Of course you should revolt. What are you waiting for?
[02:41:40.600 --> 02:41:49.600]  The U.S. government commission report into the military contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan said that it could be an understatement how much was looted and stolen.
[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:58.600]  The same thing in this report. They're saying that these assets could be just the tip of the iceberg because that's the stuff that was in a bank account with a number.
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:00.600]  They don't know where all the other wealth is hidden.
[02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:12.600]  Right. Well, the first thing Americans should do is on mass a million or ten million should immediately pick a day in the future to coordinate using a Facebook type revolution, a million foreclosure walk away.
[02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:18.600]  Just walk away from your mortgages because the banks who sold you those mortgages are financing terrorism.
[02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:27.600]  As a matter of fact, you would probably save lives by walking away from your mortgage because every penny you give a Morgan or Goldman Sachs, they just use it to fund terrorists and kill people and murder people and starve people.
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:39.600]  So do your species, the human species a favor. Don't pay your mortgage. Don't give the cancerous terrorist any more of your money unless of course you want to live in a prison.
[02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:57.600]  OK, there's that clip that Max sent over to us. Now continuing here with your Twitter questions, twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones. If you want to follow us there on the site.
[02:42:57.600 --> 02:43:03.600]  Let me read over some of these very interesting questions we got. I'll try to answer these quickly.
[02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:11.600]  You talk gold and silver accepted as currency. What are the implications? The implications are all over the world.
[02:43:11.600 --> 02:43:23.600]  Gold and silver are emerging as the new world reserve currency as every major fiat currency is devalued in a coordinated fashion by the G 20.
[02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:36.600]  So there is your answer on that front. People are really starting to get it and understand it. And we're starting to get the first inklings of local control as we continue to educate the public.
[02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:49.600]  That was from Esther. Here's another Twitter question. A topic on your show or website should be about the German stock market and how they bought the New York Stock Exchange.
[02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:58.600]  Well, well, Renee, you must have missed it, but we have covered that in great detail. And it does show how this country is being completely bought out.
[02:43:58.600 --> 02:44:11.600]  Another important question. Why is the EPA considering regulating dust yet quiet with all the toxins in the air, water and food?
[02:44:11.600 --> 02:44:22.600]  Again, why is the EPA considering regulating dust yet quite all right with toxins in the air, water, food and dust? Well, that's a way to shut down farming.
[02:44:22.600 --> 02:44:32.600]  They're saying if there's any dust when you plow a field or pick cotton with a combine, if there's any dust, they're going to put fines on you.
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:41.600]  Then only big major agribusiness can buy the waivers. So it's another way to shut down our industry, shut down our operations.
[02:44:41.600 --> 02:44:50.600]  Just like Obama has given 1,040 waivers to major companies where they don't have to buy insurance. It's the same thing here.
[02:44:50.600 --> 02:45:03.600]  If the globalist are given the waivers, then the small farm, you're going to have the control freak government bureaucrat coming on there saying that there was some dust or some mud from your cows walking around, ran into a stream.
[02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:09.600]  So they're going to fine you. It's just feudalism, a way to shut down their competition.
[02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:21.600]  Here's another one by Mythic Mystic. If we marched on the Federal Reserve, we can be victorious. It will be the Ragnarok of the New World Order.
[02:45:21.600 --> 02:45:36.600]  Do you think we should? ASAP. Ragnarok is the final battle in the Guder-Domirong for those that don't know between good and evil and the Germanic end of the world scenario for those that don't know.
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:47.600]  If we march on the Fed Reserve, we will be victorious. It will be the Ragnarok of the New World Order. Do you think we should? ASAP.
[02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:57.600]  Well, you noticed three years ago, and this is in the Obama deception, and when we went out to protest the Federal Reserve in Dallas peacefully, the Army was there spying on us.
[02:45:57.600 --> 02:46:05.600]  They know that's the real government, that's the illegitimate criminals they work for, that's the foreign bankers that hijacked America, and so they had the Army there.
[02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:15.600]  And yes, I think people go and protest by the millions in D.C. and the politicians ignore you and the cops boss you around and it's all an exercise and surf them.
[02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:29.600]  Everybody should be at New York Federal Reserve, Dallas Federal Reserve, you should be protesting these things 24-7, you should be hanging up flyers about them, you should be letting everybody know they are the evil occupational force.
[02:46:29.600 --> 02:46:36.600]  They are the problem, they are the crisis, they are the enemy, they are the illegitimate government, they are the fraudsters.
[02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:45.600]  Here's another one from Joe Hilarious. If the dollar D values in the manner that Chapman indicated on Friday, what will happen to the stock market values?
[02:46:45.600 --> 02:46:57.600]  Oh, well, those will actually go up overall because you're the stock market's denominated in dollars, predominantly, and so it'll take more dollars to buy the same stocks and the yuppies won't figure that out.
[02:46:57.600 --> 02:47:17.600]  Here's another one. Did you hear about Amtrak barring TSA from some security operations? Yes, in Texas and a bunch of other states are moving to criminally charged TSA as the feds and their untrained goon force roll out nationwide.
[02:47:17.600 --> 02:47:29.600]  Okay, I'm just out of time now because I promised to take a few calls, but I wanted to shift gears to Ted Anderson just briefly. Ted, gold and silver have gone to all new record highs today.
[02:47:29.600 --> 02:47:41.600]  Then there was some profit taking at about 1130, then they shot right back up. That is, for me, studying this in the last 11 years of it going up, usually profit takings for a couple days or even weeks.
[02:47:41.600 --> 02:47:48.600]  What does it mean that it would dip down and then shoot back up? I mean, that shows me that gold and silver fever has only begun.
[02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:55.600]  Yeah, you're right about that, Alex. At about 1130, there was some short selling that was occurring and pushed the prices down lower than where they were.
[02:47:55.600 --> 02:48:08.600]  I mean, this morning, silver hit a high of $36.71. We're almost at $37 silver. Do you realize just a week and a half ago, we're at $27 silver, almost up $10 in one week.
[02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:19.600]  I mean, gold hit a high today of $1445.30. I mean, we're hitting market highs that have never been seen before in gold. Silver has to hit $50 dollars an ounce before we can say that.
[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:27.600]  But you have to go all the way back to 1980 when the Hunt Brothers are manipulating. There's no question about it, Alex. This market's strong.
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:43.600]  I mean, at 1130 today, the gold and silver market was dipping down below its opening price and whammer right back up again. I mean, the manipulation just cannot control the price, even though they're trying so terribly hard to do it.
[02:48:43.600 --> 02:48:58.600]  And of course, here's another $6.6 billion purchased, again, U.S. Treasuries by the Federal Reserve System, another assault against the United States dollar, as though if we're dropping below $77 on the index, now we're in the 76 range.
[02:48:58.600 --> 02:49:02.600]  I mean, we're free falling, and we're falling faster than the other currencies are.
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:06.600]  Meanwhile, the media is telling us everything's fine with the economy.
[02:49:06.600 --> 02:49:16.600]  They sure are. I can tell you right now, Alex, all I can say is that people are way better off having silver than they are having this funny fiat money that the United States Treasury is putting out.
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:23.600]  And no better way to get it than to get your three videos and those silver dollars for $110. I just can't say it enough, man.
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:30.600]  Thousands of people are taking advantage of this. Your videos are being pushed out everywhere, and people are making copies and handing them off from there.
[02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:39.600]  It's like this, not only just a pebble in the pond and the ripple effect is going out, this is more like somebody is dropping a boulder in the pond and a tidal wave just...
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:50.600]  Well, resistance is victory, and now people are really listening to the films, the radio show. They're really paying attention because, you know, we didn't just start covering this two years ago like Glenn Beck.
[02:49:50.600 --> 02:50:00.600]  We've been covering it for 16 years, and in full spectrum analysis, and that's why it is important, three silver dollars for $110.
[02:50:00.600 --> 02:50:12.600]  That's with the free shipping and the three films, Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, Endgame on top of it, 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:21.600]  You gotta tell folks it's the radio special to take advantage of that, but expanding on that, Ted, what are some of the other specials you've got?
[02:50:21.600 --> 02:50:30.600]  Man, I tell you, British sovereigns right now are currently at $392 my price if you call and you say you heard it on Alex Jones. They have gone well over that.
[02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:42.600]  Frank's right now $313, I mean, we have Eagles, I mean, the Buffalo coin, I mean, whatever it is, the survival bakes of dimes, what a smart investment that is.
[02:50:42.600 --> 02:50:46.600]  I mean, there's just a whole long line of things that you should be getting into at this particular time.
[02:50:46.600 --> 02:50:55.600]  Absolutely, and tell them it's the radio special to take advantage of the lower prices. Ted's got the best deals out there, give them a call, 800-686-2237.
[02:50:55.600 --> 02:50:57.600]  Thank you so much, Ted, for joining us.
[02:50:57.600 --> 02:51:00.600]  You bet, Alex.
[02:51:28.600 --> 02:51:32.600]  There is no other program of its kind. Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.

[02:52:29.600 --> 02:52:30.600]  Could this really happen?
[02:52:30.600 --> 02:52:34.600]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[02:52:34.600 --> 02:52:40.600]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:52:40.600 --> 02:52:46.600]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. If you haven't taken time to watch this free video, do it right now.

[02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:28.600]  I have some very informative guests joining us, and I'm really wound up about the news, but couldn't really get my intellect firing today, but tomorrow I will.
[02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:35.600]  I didn't even really talk about Bill O'Reilly trying to demonize me last Friday. I'll do that tomorrow.
[02:54:35.600 --> 02:54:39.600]  There's just so much to cover, but I do want to jam in some phone calls right now.
[02:54:39.600 --> 02:54:43.600]  Bill in Connecticut, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:47.600]  Yeah, hi, Alex. Thanks for making it in today, braving your illness.
[02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:51.600]  Oh, you bet. Wild horses couldn't draw me away. Go ahead.
[02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:54.600]  Yeah, you sound great, so I wouldn't worry about it.
[02:54:54.600 --> 02:55:01.600]  Regarding Max Kaiser, is he unaware of what, of Ken Fromm's prediction four months ago?
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:06.600]  Because he seems like this is a spontaneous uprising in the Middle East.
[02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:09.600]  You know, I'm glad you mentioned that. I meant to bring up to him.
[02:55:09.600 --> 02:55:16.600]  In fact, I think I may even have brought it up to him that Lindsey Williams had said this was all going to be staged.
[02:55:16.600 --> 02:55:23.600]  You brought it up prior to getting him on the phone, but then you didn't bring it up directly with him once he got on.
[02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:29.600]  Look, the people are legitimately revolting. The point is, it's part of a larger plan.
[02:55:29.600 --> 02:55:35.600]  It's part of the Middle East being in turmoil so the bankers can cheat them on their T-bills.
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:47.600]  Right. One last point. You talked about this Google e-bomb, which has worked quite effectively.
[02:55:47.600 --> 02:55:55.600]  But I was thinking of what about a congressional email bomb where once in months we put together,
[02:55:55.600 --> 02:56:03.600]  or one of your writers or one of your articles could be amended to be posted as an email to all of the congressional leaders,
[02:56:03.600 --> 02:56:10.600]  both in the House and the Senate, maybe twice a month, once a month.
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:19.600]  I don't think that's a bad idea. The issue is there are hundreds of think tanks and lobbying groups who do have those lists,
[02:56:19.600 --> 02:56:24.600]  who do send out emails themselves, and so I can tell you a lot of it gets ignored.
[02:56:24.600 --> 02:56:30.600]  What doesn't get ignored is handwritten notes or phone calls to their offices,
[02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:33.600]  but it's a good idea. I appreciate the points, Bill.
[02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:40.600]  Resistance is victory. Let's go ahead and talk to Mary in Texas. Mary here on the air.
[02:56:40.600 --> 02:56:41.600]  Hi, Alex.
[02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:42.600]  Hey.
[02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:47.600]  I love listening to you. I'd date back to the APFN if you know what that is.
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:52.600]  American Patriot Facts Network, Citizens for Legal Reform in Dallas.
[02:56:52.600 --> 02:56:58.600]  And I got on board due to Waco when I went to help everybody in Waco as much as I could,
[02:56:58.600 --> 02:57:04.600]  investing people in jail and all this stuff in 93. That's how I got hooked up and learned what's really going on.
[02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:11.600]  And largely got scorned by everybody I knew. But thank goodness you're reaching a large amount of people
[02:57:11.600 --> 02:57:15.600]  and you're getting the word out. I have a couple of things to say.
[02:57:15.600 --> 02:57:21.600]  Don't anyone forget April the 19th. Let's all remember what happened.
[02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:25.600]  That was just a staging for what can happen to anyone else anytime.
[02:57:25.600 --> 02:57:28.600]  They were seeing if they could get away with it. It was a beta test.
[02:57:28.600 --> 02:57:34.600]  Right. And that's exactly what it was. And they even had people from Britain overlooking at this.
[02:57:34.600 --> 02:57:38.600]  Oh, they even had Russians. It was all a laboratory. That was even in Newsweek
[02:57:38.600 --> 02:57:45.600]  that they had Russian psychological warfare experts in British and they all took part in the fun.
[02:57:45.600 --> 02:57:47.600]  It's all these governments against the people.
[02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:51.600]  It was. And people run over by tanks trying to get out.
[02:57:51.600 --> 02:57:56.600]  But anyway, also, I just want to mention about Libya.
[02:57:56.600 --> 02:58:02.600]  There will be troops deployed there and this information comes off of a social network site.
[02:58:02.600 --> 02:58:06.600]  A mother innocently saying that her son is being deployed.
[02:58:06.600 --> 02:58:12.600]  So we can expect to see that. I don't doubt. I don't think this lady.
[02:58:12.600 --> 02:58:17.600]  Oh, they're massing the troops and ships and bases off the coast of Libya.
[02:58:17.600 --> 02:58:23.600]  So certainly anything else, Mary? That's it. Just keep up the good work and remember April 19th.
[02:58:23.600 --> 02:58:29.600]  Absolutely. Not only when they murdered those people at Waco and Machine Gundam and then lied about it
[02:58:29.600 --> 02:58:34.600]  and then got caught lying about it, but when the feds bombed the Alper P. Murrow Building
[02:58:34.600 --> 02:58:38.600]  to demonize the state's rights movement. Great job, crew. Great job.
[02:58:38.600 --> 02:58:48.600]  Everybody, God bless you. See you back tomorrow.
