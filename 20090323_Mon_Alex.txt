[00:00:05.123 --> 00:00:09.966]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.547]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.547 --> 00:00:13.109]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:17.291]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:25.177]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.177 --> 00:00:27.318]  Another week lays out before us.
[00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:30.761]  It is the 23rd day of March 2009.
[00:00:34.838 --> 00:00:40.804]  We're going to be live for the next four hours.
[00:00:40.804 --> 00:00:48.211]  We've got Alan Watt coming on for an hour and a half in the third and fourth hour today.
[00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:58.761]  Also, Kevin Booth will be popping in to talk about Freeway Ricky Ross, a new claim that he will earn a million dollars legally and donate it to the neighborhoods that helped
[00:00:59.827 --> 00:01:09.952]  He helped destroy, he was the big CIA front man bringing cocaine into Los Angeles and he's very close to getting out of prison.
[00:01:09.952 --> 00:01:17.496]  So that is coming up a little bit later in the show as well.
[00:01:17.496 --> 00:01:26.540]  You know, every day before I go on the air, I realize that I'm not even articulating properly the magnitude of what's happening in our world today.
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.802]  Just how real it is.
[00:01:30.802 --> 00:01:34.804]  World government is openly being announced.
[00:01:34.804 --> 00:01:44.511]  A world government of, for, and by the bankers.
[00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:49.314]  And then I learned Friday that the U.S.
[00:01:49.314 --> 00:01:52.136]  military had been putting out MIAC-type reports.
[00:01:53.356 --> 00:02:02.799]  It's already been in the news that Army Intelligence watches bike riding groups, pro-life groups, pro-abortion groups.
[00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.679]  It's completely illegal.
[00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:19.484]  They've already merged with the state police and the FBI, and they're publicly putting regular Army in police departments all across the country as, quote, liaison officers for intelligence gathering in the local police intelligence files.
[00:02:19.484 --> 00:02:21.665]  It's like we're Iraq or Afghanistan.
[00:02:21.665 --> 00:02:22.485]  We're occupied.
[00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:39.122]  But to then get an internal secret army document where they specifically talk about in the Fed in Texas the protest of last November, new ones coming up in April, 38 locations across the country.
[00:02:39.122 --> 00:02:44.383]  Ron Paul was down in Houston protesting the Fed at a park across the street.
[00:02:44.383 --> 00:02:48.244]  His brother, Wayne Paul, was with us in Dallas and the great folks that did that.
[00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:53.678]  And specifically, they had the army in plain clothes out watching us.
[00:02:53.678 --> 00:02:55.620]  Now, that's the crime.
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.821]  That is the terrorism.
[00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:59.243]  That is the secret police.
[00:02:59.243 --> 00:03:09.071]  For those that don't know what East Germany was like, or Communist China still today, or what Cuba's like, or Soviet Russia, I mean, this is so anti-freedom.
[00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:12.173]  This is 180 degrees from freedom.
[00:03:12.173 --> 00:03:16.117]  This is classical tyranny.
[00:03:16.117 --> 00:03:18.379]  And you know, I get up here on air and I tell you about how
[00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:30.745]  Well, we got footage of it, how we were followed in Virginia, covering Bilderberg, and we had guys coming up in the hotel rooms, you know, big special forces types, but 45 years old.
[00:03:30.745 --> 00:03:34.628]  Pentagon Protective Services, State Department Protective Services.
[00:03:34.628 --> 00:03:36.329]  Hey, let's attack the State Department!
[00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.251]  You're just like, come on, man.
[00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:43.214]  And then people snicker and joke and go, oh, that's not happening, Alex.
[00:03:43.214 --> 00:03:46.357]  Just like when we put the MIAC report out, it was fake, I just made it up.
[00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.542]  Like when I, two months before 9-11, I said they're going to attack the World Trade Center, get the word out, they're going to blame it on their asset.
[00:03:52.542 --> 00:03:55.885]  Bin Laden, oh Alex, shut up, you're crazy.
[00:03:55.885 --> 00:04:00.928]  Or when I publicly said on air I was going to infiltrate Bohemian Grove, people laughed at that and I did it.
[00:04:00.928 --> 00:04:15.539]  And it isn't so much that I'm some special or wonderful can-do person, it's that other people have lost or never learned to have a belief in themselves or to realize just what powerful creatures we all are.
[00:04:16.718 --> 00:04:18.599]  You just don't have any initiative.
[00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:22.743]  And so you can't imagine that I have this initiative.
[00:04:22.743 --> 00:04:25.565]  But the proof is in the pudding.
[00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:28.907]  Number one alternative media website, InfoWars.com.
[00:04:28.907 --> 00:04:29.688]  Number one.
[00:04:29.688 --> 00:04:31.109]  All the rating services.
[00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:33.090]  Alexa, you name it.
[00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.633]  And a whole constellation of other big sites, like PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:36.633 --> 00:04:38.815]  It's in the top ten alternative media sites.
[00:04:41.098 --> 00:04:44.021]  And it seems to enrage a lot of people that we're so successful.
[00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:49.226]  Why don't you apply yourselves and become successful in the fight against the New World Order?
[00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:51.508]  Why don't you believe in yourselves?
[00:04:51.508 --> 00:04:56.633]  Well, more and more people are, and they're turning that innate human power loose, and I salute you.
[00:04:56.633 --> 00:04:57.894]  We'll come back with all the big news.
[00:04:57.894 --> 00:04:58.375]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.876 --> 00:05:02.558]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:05:02.558 --> 00:05:04.301]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:06.984]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:05:06.984 --> 00:05:12.131]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:15.335]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:05:15.335 --> 00:05:18.780]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[00:05:19.221 --> 00:05:31.766]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[00:05:31.766 --> 00:05:33.767]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:35.488]  I use one every day.
[00:05:35.488 --> 00:05:37.949]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:41.350]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:13.513]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.513 --> 00:06:20.018]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:20.018 --> 00:06:21.979]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:24.461]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:24.461 --> 00:06:35.349]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.300]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.161]  It's about a one world government.
[00:06:41.161 --> 00:06:48.062]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:48.062 --> 00:06:56.324]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:56.324 --> 00:06:57.904]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.904 --> 00:07:04.946]  The people strike back.
[00:07:04.946 --> 00:07:06.126]  Let's go to the heart of the matter.
[00:07:06.522 --> 00:07:11.464]  Life Change Tea has had some commercials that are not appealing to those who live in denial.
[00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:17.466]  Maybe we are to believe there are no parasites in the world, and that having a clogged colon is good for you.
[00:07:17.466 --> 00:07:20.327]  That being overweight is absolutely healthy.
[00:07:20.327 --> 00:07:23.308]  That there are no unhealthy chemicals in the air.
[00:07:23.308 --> 00:07:26.989]  And last but not least, fluoride in your water is good for you.
[00:07:26.989 --> 00:07:27.049]  Not.

[00:08:05.655 --> 00:08:06.976]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.976 --> 00:08:08.737]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.737 --> 00:08:10.499]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.499 --> 00:08:12.100]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.641]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:17.825]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:31.896]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:31.896 --> 00:08:32.756]  Okay, so...
[00:08:41.534 --> 00:08:43.655]  We know the state police around the country.
[00:08:43.655 --> 00:08:48.517]  We know military intelligence spies on anybody that protests Halliburton or anybody else.
[00:08:48.517 --> 00:08:52.119]  We know it's all violations of federal law, and I'm going to be going over that.
[00:08:52.119 --> 00:08:58.662]  The fact that they are going after the, in the Fed, organic protest organization.
[00:09:01.055 --> 00:09:03.758]  And I guess Gary Franchi and others started up.
[00:09:03.758 --> 00:09:07.582]  Another example of good people actually taking action and having a huge effect.
[00:09:07.582 --> 00:09:22.399]  This is being done because the private Federal Reserve is a criminal organization that has hijacked our nation, and openly brags before Congress that they are above the President, above the Legislative, above the Judicial, and that no one can have any oversight over them.
[00:09:23.649 --> 00:09:29.691]  And these criminals swagger around Washington, everyone bows down to them when they go into the committee hearings, at least in the past.
[00:09:29.691 --> 00:09:35.533]  Now, people like Senator... Oh, what's the senator?
[00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:36.473]  We played the clip.
[00:09:36.473 --> 00:09:37.874]  Senator Sanders.
[00:09:37.874 --> 00:09:40.134]  People like Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:09:40.134 --> 00:09:47.677]  So many others are confronting them and not kissing up to them, and their aura of god-likeness is beginning to wear thin.
[00:09:49.517 --> 00:10:09.052]  But just think about how tyrannical it is, how just openly corrupted it is that they have military intelligence following us around, and that specifically this was leaked out of Texas to the Libertarian Party, and we've made phone calls and confirmed that this indeed is going on.
[00:10:09.052 --> 00:10:12.235]  I made phone calls to the military offices this weekend.
[00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:22.016]  The number was not listed, but I knew where it was based out of, Fort Hood, Texas, and out of Camp Mabry, Austin, Texas.
[00:10:22.016 --> 00:10:25.939]  And they were not pleased to know that we have the document.
[00:10:25.939 --> 00:10:29.741]  It's up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:10:29.741 --> 00:10:34.284]  Because I've been tracking this group for a long time and knew exactly where to call.
[00:10:34.284 --> 00:10:37.005]  I had some old documents the FBI screwed up and gave us in 1998.
[00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.633]  Made some phone calls to those numbers as well.
[00:10:43.633 --> 00:10:46.355]  Same offices.
[00:10:46.355 --> 00:10:53.781]  There's an army checkpoint again on I-35 south of Waco and Temple, Belton Line.
[00:10:53.781 --> 00:10:56.463]  It's in police state to the takeover.
[00:10:58.303 --> 00:11:02.007]  And Mike Hanson's up there doing construction work.
[00:11:02.007 --> 00:11:08.573]  He sees an army checkpoint, starts filming it, and the local police, Captain Best and others come over and say, turn your cameras off.
[00:11:08.573 --> 00:11:10.094]  And they say, okay, the FBI's coming.
[00:11:10.094 --> 00:11:13.958]  Two hours later, an FBI car pulls up, says, okay, here's the press release.
[00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.000]  Now, stay away from the checkpoint.
[00:11:17.199 --> 00:11:21.602]  And there was a press release cover sheet stapled to it classified documents.
[00:11:21.602 --> 00:11:23.283]  Now, maybe the FBI guy?
[00:11:23.283 --> 00:11:26.225]  I'm starting to think that some of them may be on our side.
[00:11:26.225 --> 00:11:29.447]  I mean, we know the state police leaking this to us are on our side.
[00:11:29.447 --> 00:11:33.049]  We know the army that leaked this is on our side.
[00:11:33.049 --> 00:11:38.532]  We know that Ron Paul got more campaign contributions than any other candidate in both parties, so we know a lot of them are on our side.
[00:11:38.532 --> 00:11:40.834]  The majority.
[00:11:40.834 --> 00:11:43.235]  And, you know, I'm not stupid.
[00:11:43.235 --> 00:11:44.016]  I understand
[00:11:45.333 --> 00:11:56.976]  I almost don't want to say this on air because I don't want higher-ups to realize what's really going on here, but I think they're smart enough to know what's going on, so it's no secret.
[00:11:56.976 --> 00:12:05.398]  The way this Army document was written is a form of PSYOP rebellion against the government.
[00:12:05.398 --> 00:12:09.239]  And I'm going to go over this later in the show in detail.
[00:12:09.239 --> 00:12:10.579]  It is written with respect.
[00:12:10.579 --> 00:12:14.120]  It is written for honor of those of us protesting the private Federal Reserve.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:35.006]  It is written to wake up the military and police to the tyranny of the Federal Reserve, but it follows its order to liaison with local FBI and police and to, at the bottom of the page, basically say we can be involved in terrorism.
[00:12:35.006 --> 00:12:36.246]  So this is a
[00:12:38.248 --> 00:12:43.589]  Reverse double PSYOP, I don't know the proper term, a triple cross on the enemy here.
[00:12:43.589 --> 00:12:51.031]  Now that is not the case with the MIAC report out of Missouri that the Governor admits was written by the Feds and is in all 50 states, different variants of it.
[00:12:51.031 --> 00:12:57.453]  That was written by the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL, components of it.
[00:12:57.453 --> 00:13:00.874]  And that basically, the first page says, if you're a cop killer,
[00:13:02.918 --> 00:13:11.483]  Who is a white supremacist, if you believe, in the next seven pages, that there's a new world order, a North American Union, that the Federal Reserve is corrupt.
[00:13:11.483 --> 00:13:13.845]  That is a demonization piece, clearly.
[00:13:13.845 --> 00:13:18.627]  This Army report, I'm going to read it later, here on air.
[00:13:18.627 --> 00:13:22.950]  You can read it for yourself.
[00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.792]  It's the Army dispatched in response to end the Fed protests.
[00:13:25.792 --> 00:13:30.855]  Now, ten years ago, the military was not awake to the level they are now.
[00:13:33.291 --> 00:13:37.374]  They were just now listening to us, and just now checking out what we had to say.
[00:13:37.374 --> 00:13:41.837]  Since then, everything we talked about has happened, so we have high credibility with them.
[00:13:41.837 --> 00:13:48.221]  And Ron Paul really opened the door, and the Ron Paul movement like nothing else, to the military.
[00:13:48.221 --> 00:13:54.085]  But when I first had run-ins with Army Intelligence, it was threatening.
[00:13:54.085 --> 00:14:01.370]  Two different events, where I'd walk out to my car in a parking lot, and there'd be guys in suits, 32, 35 years old,
[00:14:04.309 --> 00:14:12.336]  You know, the special forces bearing and they would make little threatening comments and tell me I was being watched.
[00:14:12.336 --> 00:14:13.497]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:14:13.497 --> 00:14:14.938]  I heard you got a special team.
[00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:16.239]  You're planning something.
[00:14:16.239 --> 00:14:17.761]  You know, we want to help you.
[00:14:17.761 --> 00:14:18.321]  What are you planning?
[00:14:18.321 --> 00:14:19.482]  Are you going to do something violent?
[00:14:19.482 --> 00:14:20.703]  And I'm like, no, no, my team.
[00:14:20.703 --> 00:14:25.327]  When I say I'm thinking my team, I'm talking about my people that I work with.
[00:14:25.327 --> 00:14:26.949]  No, we're just checking that out.
[00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:29.992]  We're just... There was another case where an FBI agent showed up.
[00:14:31.175 --> 00:14:35.239]  He was literally red-faced and breathing heavy, about six foot five.
[00:14:35.239 --> 00:14:38.082]  Those look like professional bike riders, the FBI guys.
[00:14:38.082 --> 00:14:39.944]  You know, he was that type.
[00:14:39.944 --> 00:14:49.954]  And I do a two-hour TV show that day, and I say, the FBI's criminal and murdered the people at Waco, and I demand you call in, or if I'm not a liar and you're not criminals, that you show up down here.
[00:14:49.954 --> 00:14:51.295]  And sure enough, here's this guy at the door.
[00:14:52.577 --> 00:14:59.761]  He's got the unmarked FBI car out front, but he was literally huffing and puffing, telling me the FBI wasn't all bad.
[00:14:59.761 --> 00:15:00.522]  And I said, are you FBI?
[00:15:00.522 --> 00:15:02.143]  And he said, well, I'm not going to answer that.
[00:15:02.143 --> 00:15:04.464]  So, you know, I had that case too.
[00:15:04.464 --> 00:15:18.233]  But another time in a Target parking lot, they got very threatening, pulled up behind me, blocked me in, I got out, they got around me, and just told me basically that if I ever got out of line, I was dead.
[00:15:19.545 --> 00:15:21.066]  So, you know, this is the real world.
[00:15:21.066 --> 00:15:22.727]  This is what I deal with every day.
[00:15:22.727 --> 00:15:28.110]  The type of crap I deal with.
[00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:37.535]  I deal with every day knowing this is going on.
[00:15:37.535 --> 00:15:46.880]  And, you know, that's when you realize just how real all of this is, is when you're in the fight and things like this happen over and over again.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.021]  I was mentioning a few ancient cases, but
[00:15:51.664 --> 00:15:52.565]  I mean, it's on record.
[00:15:52.565 --> 00:15:58.969]  It was in a score of newspapers that they detained me for 15 hours, yelled and screamed at me, said I was going to go to prison in Canada.
[00:15:58.969 --> 00:16:02.391]  That was not fun.
[00:16:02.391 --> 00:16:07.875]  By the grace of God, they didn't successfully search all of us, and one of my guys had a cell phone.
[00:16:07.875 --> 00:16:19.643]  He slipped it to me in the holding room, and I called the CPC, who actually showed up because I was scheduled for an interview with them that next day, and by then it was that next day, so they showed up.
[00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.591]  I called them, left a message, and then I called Jim Tucker.
[00:16:25.591 --> 00:16:30.653]  He was also scheduled for the same interview, so he got them out there.
[00:16:30.653 --> 00:16:37.975]  But that's what we go through to bring you this information.
[00:16:37.975 --> 00:16:43.717]  So coming up, Army dispatch in response to end the Fed protest.
[00:16:43.717 --> 00:16:49.959]  The other huge news is Obama supporters unleashed a cell banker plan, 13 million of them.
[00:16:54.703 --> 00:17:00.447]  13 million to quote double their numbers to 26 mil.
[00:17:00.447 --> 00:17:16.659]  They're going out to get recruits and they're using government-paid-for PSAs everywhere to recruit them to the Democratic Party's private site usaservice.org and this is right out of Mao Zedong.
[00:17:16.659 --> 00:17:22.063]  Tarpley always says it's more like Mussolini and I guess he did pioneer this in the twenties but
[00:17:23.237 --> 00:17:32.644]  The way it's configured is Maoist, but certainly Mao did pick up a lot of what he did from the fascists in their organizational system.
[00:17:32.644 --> 00:17:40.650]  So I guess the root is Mussolini-type garbage, but the configuration is Maoist.
[00:17:43.482 --> 00:17:44.743]  And it's really happening.
[00:17:44.743 --> 00:17:50.306]  I've got mainstream news reports how they're recruiting Americans to be spies and spy on other Americans.
[00:17:50.306 --> 00:17:55.069]  British headlines over the weekend that are up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:17:55.069 --> 00:18:02.633]  Mainstream news just announcing, oh yeah, we're going to have citizen spies everywhere looking for terrorists and fighting crime.
[00:18:02.633 --> 00:18:10.818]  And they've been setting this up in every western nation for decades, but now, I mean, it's really coming out in the open and they're saying, oh, this will be the new jobs, this is the new stimulus package.
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:21.428]  Is a one million person corps, and there's five other corps, but this is the big one, and it will be compulsory.
[00:18:21.428 --> 00:18:25.832]  I mean, they passed the draft in the House last Thursday.
[00:18:25.832 --> 00:18:28.014]  National draft is passed.
[00:18:28.014 --> 00:18:30.196]  I should be yelling and screaming and hyperventilating over that.
[00:18:30.196 --> 00:18:31.297]  I'm not.
[00:18:31.297 --> 00:18:32.859]  I've been conditioned and accepted, I guess.
[00:18:34.264 --> 00:18:41.187]  And the language is, oh, we're setting up a federal agency to prepare the feasibility of force compulsory service.
[00:18:41.187 --> 00:18:48.249]  And then you read the Nexus tie-in a month ago with the Defense Department issuance.
[00:18:48.249 --> 00:18:52.911]  And last night on the show, I read that Army directive, a Pentagon directive.
[00:18:52.911 --> 00:19:01.995]  And it says, with a new million-person force, that the Pentagon will direct whether they serve domestically or overseas in support of combat operations.
[00:19:04.994 --> 00:19:16.763]  So this is a giant pool to suppress and control all our towns and cities and states here, but also in third world nations that get invaded, blasted to daylights, their infrastructure destroyed.
[00:19:16.763 --> 00:19:23.769]  Then hundreds of thousands of little bureaucrats come in behind the military to then take over the society.
[00:19:23.769 --> 00:19:24.910]  And they're going to be drafted.
[00:19:26.957 --> 00:19:30.082]  But they don't call it a draft, they just call it compulsory service.
[00:19:30.082 --> 00:19:31.363]  Mandatory.
[00:19:31.363 --> 00:19:34.588]  I mean, this has passed the House, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:34.588 --> 00:19:37.572]  This is going to the Senate and they're set to pass it.
[00:19:37.572 --> 00:19:39.896]  It passed by a huge majority in the House of Representatives.
[00:19:42.611 --> 00:19:46.455]  They are really trying a Nazi-slash-Soviet-style takeover.
[00:19:46.455 --> 00:19:47.917]  It's really happening.
[00:19:47.917 --> 00:19:51.641]  Everything that was foretold, everything they set up, was all in preparation of this.
[00:19:51.641 --> 00:19:53.143]  Now we're here.
[00:19:53.143 --> 00:19:56.166]  Now the military is tracking me and following me.
[00:19:56.166 --> 00:19:59.129]  It's openly being admitted to.
[00:19:59.129 --> 00:19:59.470]  We're here.
[00:20:01.025 --> 00:20:04.548]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:20:04.548 --> 00:20:06.469]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:20:06.469 --> 00:20:12.033]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.

[00:20:52.516 --> 00:20:53.818]  Be a part of the revolution today!
[00:21:01.463 --> 00:21:07.269]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:07.269 --> 00:21:14.857]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:21:14.857 --> 00:21:21.003]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:21.423 --> 00:21:23.405]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:23.405 --> 00:21:25.907]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:25.907 --> 00:21:37.475]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:21:37.475 --> 00:21:39.157]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:39.157 --> 00:21:41.018]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:21:41.018 --> 00:21:47.243]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:21:56.179 --> 00:21:57.762]  The Obama Deception.
[00:21:57.762 --> 00:21:58.944]  The people strike back!
[00:22:00.762 --> 00:22:01.803]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:01.803 --> 00:22:06.745]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:22:06.745 --> 00:22:14.829]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:22:14.829 --> 00:22:20.412]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:22:20.412 --> 00:22:27.375]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:22:27.675 --> 00:22:33.258]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:22:33.258 --> 00:22:38.340]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:46.283]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:22:46.283 --> 00:22:52.846]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:22:52.846 --> 00:22:53.967]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:56.704 --> 00:22:57.304]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:57.304 --> 00:23:02.405]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:23:02.405 --> 00:23:09.366]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:23:09.366 --> 00:23:17.748]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:23:17.748 --> 00:23:23.489]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:25.490]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:27.672]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:23:27.672 --> 00:23:32.215]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:23:32.215 --> 00:23:34.437]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:23:34.437 --> 00:23:42.263]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:23:42.503 --> 00:23:43.644]  I was sitting in traffic
[00:24:11.618 --> 00:24:35.944]  Listen to the radio George Strait was singing Seashores of Old Mexico It sounded so good I got an idea I'm gonna go there since they're all over here The Lonestar State should be renamed Texico
[00:24:39.232 --> 00:24:40.252]  Welcome back!
[00:24:40.252 --> 00:24:47.075]  Yeah, they can't put the Army on the border.
[00:25:09.952 --> 00:25:19.878]  As the Mexican drug gangs kill police, citizens, whoever else they want, kidnap us en masse.
[00:25:19.878 --> 00:25:27.963]  But don't worry, they've got plenty of army to spy on the people of the United States.
[00:25:27.963 --> 00:25:34.927]  Because we dare protest the private Federal Reserve that tells Congress to sit down and shut up, that they run nothing.
[00:25:39.727 --> 00:25:43.169]  That is coming up.
[00:25:43.169 --> 00:25:45.890]  Here's the type of other financial news I have in front of me today.
[00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:51.493]  Treasury's toxic asset plan could cost $1 trillion.
[00:25:51.493 --> 00:26:05.781]  The Obama administration's latest attempt to tackle the banking crisis and get loans flowing to families and businesses will create a new government entity, the Public Private Investment Program, to help purchase as much as $1 trillion in toxic assets on bank books.
[00:26:07.486 --> 00:26:19.066]  The new effort to be unveiled today will be followed next day with the release of an administration's broad framework for overhauling the financial system to ensure that the current crisis, the worst in seven decades, is not repeated.
[00:26:21.107 --> 00:26:30.309]  The key part of the regulatory framework will give the government new regulatory authority to take over troubled institutions that would pose a threat to the entire fiscal system if they failed.
[00:26:30.309 --> 00:26:35.970]  Now, they're announcing this means private companies, not just brokerage firms, banks, and insurance companies.
[00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:40.571]  And then they will set the pay of regular Americans and middle class people.
[00:26:40.571 --> 00:26:43.652]  It's just all the big bankers and CEOs, they have loopholes.
[00:26:44.775 --> 00:26:44.955]  I think?
[00:27:04.793 --> 00:27:08.855]  Huge bonuses, and then it came out that they wrote the specific loopholes.
[00:27:08.855 --> 00:27:16.639]  So that kind of blew up in their face a bit there with their propaganda, but still everybody's focused on the $165 million, not the $9.7 trillion and counting.
[00:27:16.639 --> 00:27:18.140]  That number's over a month old.
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.100]  We haven't gotten new numbers yet.
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:24.343]  It's always trillions plus every month since the banker takeover of October 3rd.
[00:27:24.343 --> 00:27:33.127]  See, they don't need any new powers, any new illegitimate powers since the October 3rd power grab that gave them unlimited secret funding, no oversight, total control.
[00:27:36.246 --> 00:27:47.758]  So when you hear about them saying they want new packages and new plans, that's just their way to introduce the fact that they spent trillions and trillions more, and then everybody's focusing on this toxic debt asset buyback.
[00:27:47.758 --> 00:27:51.643]  Remember they told you in October, November into October,
[00:27:54.557 --> 00:28:03.420]  September into October and then into November and December that, oh, we've got to have this to unplug the toxic mortgages.
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.340]  That's the debt.
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:09.122]  It'll be easy to unplug all this and unclog it.
[00:28:09.122 --> 00:28:09.802]  And then what happened?
[00:28:10.945 --> 00:28:14.209]  October 4th, after they passed it, they said, look, we don't need it for that anymore.
[00:28:14.209 --> 00:28:16.432]  The problem isn't the mortgages, which it wasn't.
[00:28:16.432 --> 00:28:19.496]  They just wanted to make it sound like the people had done this.
[00:28:19.496 --> 00:28:21.619]  They said, we're not going to tell you where we're spending it, though.
[00:28:21.619 --> 00:28:26.004]  And then Geithner got in and he'd actually written part of the bailout.
[00:28:26.004 --> 00:28:28.648]  So the whole policy just continued seamlessly.
[00:28:30.683 --> 00:28:40.608]  And so when you hear they need new powers and that there's a G20 meeting coming up and that they've been meeting in secret, that's all over the news, that is to prepare the new bank of the world.
[00:28:40.608 --> 00:28:42.049]  They admit that.
[00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:48.673]  A new bank of the world that you will pay all your taxes to and will regulate all the currencies and interest rates of the planet.
[00:28:48.673 --> 00:28:52.515]  When they can engage in more market rigging and more insider trading and scams.
[00:28:54.116 --> 00:28:57.039]  Senator Greg says Obama budget will bankrupt the U.S.
[00:28:57.039 --> 00:29:03.705]  The top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee says the Obama administration is on the right course to save the nation's financial system.
[00:29:06.744 --> 00:29:14.546]  But Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire also says President Obama's massive budget proposal will bankrupt the country.
[00:29:14.546 --> 00:29:19.728]  Gregg says he has no regrets in withdrawing his nomination to become Commerce Secretary.
[00:29:19.728 --> 00:29:23.649]  He pulled out after deciding he would not fully back the administration's economic policies.
[00:29:23.649 --> 00:29:28.631]  The Senator said Obama's spending plan, in the midst of a prolonged recession, would leave the next generation of the country
[00:29:30.182 --> 00:29:31.903]  Too expensive to live in.
[00:29:31.903 --> 00:29:32.983]  Well, that's the whole plan.
[00:29:32.983 --> 00:29:38.205]  They want to fully bankrupt everybody and then sign our names collectively over all of this.
[00:29:38.205 --> 00:29:51.151]  That's why Obama's going door-to-door with 13 million Hitlerjugend trying to pressure people into signing a pledge to sign on to it so they can morally claim we agreed to it.
[00:29:51.151 --> 00:29:52.532]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.532 --> 00:29:55.073]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.073 --> 00:29:57.754]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.198 --> 00:30:07.363]  How would you like to finally be debt free without paying another cent to creditors and not have to file bankruptcy?
[00:30:07.363 --> 00:30:10.987]  DebtCrisisSolutions.com can help free you from the debt trap.

[00:30:15.851 --> 00:30:19.314]  With our program, there are no more payments to creditors or collectors.
[00:30:19.554 --> 00:30:20.034]  We're good to go.
[00:30:35.265 --> 00:30:37.206]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:31:05.006 --> 00:31:07.054]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.854 --> 00:31:13.736]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.736 --> 00:31:20.239]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:20.239 --> 00:31:22.200]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.661]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:31:24.661 --> 00:31:35.565]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.845 --> 00:31:39.526]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.526 --> 00:31:41.367]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:41.367 --> 00:31:48.290]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:56.554]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.554 --> 00:31:58.115]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:58.115 --> 00:31:59.316]  The people strike back.
[00:32:01.078 --> 00:32:04.540]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:08.323]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:32:08.323 --> 00:32:14.627]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:32:14.627 --> 00:32:19.270]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:25.294]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:32:25.294 --> 00:32:28.296]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:32:31.018 --> 00:32:31.338]  I think so.
[00:33:12.182 --> 00:33:14.084]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:14.084 --> 00:33:15.105]  to 3 p.m.
[00:33:15.105 --> 00:33:16.346]  Central Standard Time.
[00:33:16.346 --> 00:33:18.508]  We're here live.
[00:33:18.508 --> 00:33:20.049]  Pre-broadcast on wonderful A.M.
[00:33:20.049 --> 00:33:22.552]  and M. affiliates across the nation.
[00:33:22.552 --> 00:33:25.735]  Simulcast on global shortwave W.W.C.R.
[00:33:25.735 --> 00:33:29.078]  Four hours live during the day and then from 9 to 1 a.m.
[00:33:29.078 --> 00:33:31.780]  Central Standard Time.
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:37.125]  At night, Jason Burmess.
[00:33:37.125 --> 00:33:37.846]  Nine to midnight,
[00:33:39.588 --> 00:33:47.214]  Right out of the studio with the Infowarrior.
[00:33:47.214 --> 00:33:55.620]  Okay, I want to get into Army dispatched in response to in the Fed protest and read over the document itself here on air.
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:02.926]  It dovetails with the MIAC report and the rest of it and the secret police we have in this country.
[00:34:02.926 --> 00:34:07.570]  You know, a week and a half ago, almost two weeks ago, when they had that terrible mass shooting in Alabama,
[00:34:09.318 --> 00:34:12.159]  I pointed out it was a violation of posse comitatus in federal law.
[00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:15.079]  Now that's in the Houston Chronicle and other major newspapers.
[00:34:15.079 --> 00:34:19.400]  The military is investigating if it violated posse comitatus.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.540]  They've had to have press conferences over it.
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:26.181]  There is no doubt it's against the law to have army intelligence running around spying on the American people.
[00:34:26.181 --> 00:34:29.122]  Again, that's coming up.
[00:34:29.122 --> 00:34:29.882]  But what do you expect?
[00:34:29.882 --> 00:34:32.542]  You have criminal bankers that have completely hijacked this nation.
[00:34:32.542 --> 00:34:35.483]  They're bankrupting it to consolidate wealth and power.
[00:34:35.483 --> 00:34:36.503]  Even Rolling Stone
[00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:48.877]  Had a headline in an article called The Takeover, in this week's publication, and they say it's not about a bailout, it's about power and a takeover.
[00:34:48.877 --> 00:34:50.579]  Yeah, bring it in to me.
[00:34:50.579 --> 00:34:51.660]  Whoosh, I left it in the other room.
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:52.941]  You're smart to just think of that.
[00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:55.122]  It's called The Big Takeover.
[00:34:55.122 --> 00:34:59.005]  The global economic crisis isn't about money, it's about power.
[00:34:59.005 --> 00:35:02.468]  How Wall Street insiders are using the bailout to stage a revolution.
[00:35:07.765 --> 00:35:09.965]  Just amazing.
[00:35:09.965 --> 00:35:12.146]  So, we'll be going over that.
[00:35:12.146 --> 00:35:32.991]  I mean, the government is completely illegitimate on its face, and they're hoping this Obama-mania can sucker enough people to go along with it, and that they can then sick this mass of 13 million minions, and they want to double it to 26 million, so they can point news cameras at millions of people and say, look, the public wants it when every poll says the public, literally 98%, 99% are against the bankers.
[00:35:35.831 --> 00:35:45.257]  But it doesn't matter, you got the 2% saying we're terrorists, because we don't want foreign bankers raping us financially.
[00:35:45.257 --> 00:35:47.439]  World markets surge ahead of U.S.
[00:35:47.439 --> 00:35:50.841]  bank asset plans.
[00:35:50.841 --> 00:35:52.162]  World markets surge on U.S.
[00:35:52.162 --> 00:35:54.904]  banking crisis plan, Japan stimulus hopes.
[00:35:54.904 --> 00:36:04.851]  The promise of putting trillions of dollars of new monetization out into the world system caused stocks to go up sharply today.
[00:36:08.376 --> 00:36:14.040]  Because that signifies that they're going to go with the hyperinflationary move.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.862]  See, they wouldn't say which direction they were going to go.
[00:36:17.862 --> 00:36:24.807]  Let us just have a recession now and then fix things or go into a long hyperinflationary depression.
[00:36:24.807 --> 00:36:29.730]  And many fools out there think that that's a better option.
[00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:31.811]  World stock market soared Monday ahead of U.S.
[00:36:31.811 --> 00:36:36.835]  announcement to purge as much as $1 trillion in bad bank assets as Japan signaled
[00:36:37.853 --> 00:36:42.036]  More stimulus measures to resuscitate the world's second largest economy.
[00:36:42.036 --> 00:36:44.498]  What does that mean?
[00:36:44.498 --> 00:37:03.454]  It means the trillions and trillions of dollars of derivatives of toxic, made-up, made-off type Ponzi paper, that they are going to basically put all that on the taxpayers of the Western world, from Japan to England to the United States, from Australia to Germany.
[00:37:03.454 --> 00:37:06.916]  And so the criminal class, the looting class,
[00:37:11.243 --> 00:37:15.725]  Casino class, the casino economy class, are pleased!
[00:37:15.725 --> 00:37:19.986]  Because for the time being, this means that it will probably run the stock market back up.
[00:37:19.986 --> 00:37:24.488]  Which is what Bob Chapman and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and everybody else has said on this show.
[00:37:24.488 --> 00:37:29.950]  This is sacrificing the real economy, Main Street, real jobs, your futures.
[00:37:31.644 --> 00:37:32.726]  Everything.
[00:37:32.726 --> 00:37:43.242]  Huge new tax increases at every level to pay off this debt that is going to be fed directly into the gaping mouth of the Wall Street global system.
[00:37:46.055 --> 00:37:57.781]  And so for the time, the stock market will be run up again and then run back down again and they can, you know, manipulate and make huge, obscene, fraudulent, non-free market profits.
[00:37:57.781 --> 00:37:58.741]  They keep calling it the free market.
[00:37:58.741 --> 00:38:00.082]  It's not the free market.
[00:38:00.082 --> 00:38:02.643]  It's a rigged scam.
[00:38:02.643 --> 00:38:03.784]  And the house always wins.
[00:38:03.784 --> 00:38:05.105]  The house is the new world order.
[00:38:05.105 --> 00:38:07.866]  The house of world government, as the elitists call themselves.
[00:38:07.866 --> 00:38:10.707]  They call the new world order the house of world government.
[00:38:10.707 --> 00:38:11.808]  The house of Rothschild.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:25.765]  And so they've decided to hyperinflate and turn us into a complete third world nation as well as Western Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand.
[00:38:25.765 --> 00:38:30.427]  And the elite are celebrating.
[00:38:30.427 --> 00:38:33.449]  And it's only going to get worse if they continue down this road.
[00:38:33.449 --> 00:38:39.092]  Here's another report out of Reuters.
[00:38:39.092 --> 00:38:43.394]  IMF says clean up banks to tackle dire world crisis.
[00:38:45.737 --> 00:38:53.440]  Economic crisis, dire risk of unrest and war, says the IMF.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.920]  What has Bush done?
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:39:00.602]  He said, do this bailout or we'll have a depression next week.
[00:39:00.602 --> 00:39:02.482]  They let the banks take over, things got worse.
[00:39:02.482 --> 00:39:06.964]  Do this steep economic stimulus package, really a federalization package, or we'll have a depression.
[00:39:06.964 --> 00:39:09.765]  Then Obama goes on 60 Minutes last night, I watched it.
[00:39:10.856 --> 00:39:17.486]  And he says, part of his permanent campaign, scores of speeches a day and appearances, he says, look, you gotta do this or we're gonna have a depression.
[00:39:18.763 --> 00:39:21.285]  But then he added, oh, but things aren't that bad.
[00:39:21.285 --> 00:39:23.647]  Just do this and everything will be fine.
[00:39:23.647 --> 00:39:24.448]  That's the psychology.
[00:39:24.448 --> 00:39:46.486]  There's going to be a depression if you don't do what I say, and that's this new bank of the world, and if you don't like the $190,000 in debt on each American through the leveraged bailout, well, you're really going to enjoy the hundreds of thousands of more debt they're going to pile on each and every one of us individually, and all the taxes they're going to levy that will further destroy any middle class or any industry we had in this nation.
[00:39:46.986 --> 00:39:57.590]  Because they use economics as a weapon of vertical integration and consolidation.
[00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:03.373]  IMF says clean up banks to tackle dire world crisis, economic crisis, dire risk of unrest and war.
[00:40:03.373 --> 00:40:03.693]  IMF.
[00:40:06.653 --> 00:40:13.676]  The world is in a dire economic crisis, but no recovery is possible until the financial sector is cleaned up by the very people that engineered it, I would add.
[00:40:13.676 --> 00:40:22.320]  The head of the International Monetary Fund said today the crisis will push millions into poverty and unemployment, risking social unrest and even war.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.841]  An urgent action is required, IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said.
[00:40:26.841 --> 00:40:29.423]  It's the same old deal.
[00:40:29.423 --> 00:40:32.164]  Pass global carbon taxes or all the polar bears will drown.
[00:40:32.164 --> 00:40:32.704]  Total lie.
[00:40:34.107 --> 00:40:38.908]  Past global carbon taxes or the earth will... 5 billion people will die.
[00:40:38.908 --> 00:40:43.209]  That was the headline last week by Al Gore's head scientist.
[00:40:43.209 --> 00:40:44.429]  5 billion will die!
[00:40:44.429 --> 00:40:45.390]  It's the end of the world!
[00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:45.990]  Depression!
[00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:55.152]  Meanwhile, if you follow what they want, and you allow them to set up world government, they're going to carry out the eugenics operation through release control bioweapon plagues, and then that will happen.
[00:40:56.687 --> 00:41:01.048]  The crisis will push millions into poverty and unemployment, risking social unrest, even war.
[00:41:01.048 --> 00:41:03.869]  Urgent action is required, the IMF Managing Director said.
[00:41:03.869 --> 00:41:13.813]  Bluntly, the situation is dire, he told a meeting of the crisis at the International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency representing unions, employers, and governments that study labor issues.
[00:41:14.893 --> 00:41:28.414]  Again, give all the remaining power to the bankers for a world government of and for by the bankers and maybe things will be okay and then things get worse and they say give us more power or everything will get worse and then give us more power everything will get worse and then it gets worse.
[00:41:28.414 --> 00:41:29.275]  Strauss-Kahn was
[00:41:31.291 --> 00:41:37.496]  Talking less than two weeks before a summit of the G20, leading nations on April 2nd to tackle the crises.
[00:41:37.496 --> 00:41:45.764]  As the crisis spills over into developed countries, millions of people will be pushed back into poverty and hardship, Strauss-Kahn said.
[00:41:45.764 --> 00:41:50.148]  All this will affect dramatically unemployment and beyond unemployment for many countries.
[00:41:50.148 --> 00:41:52.430]  It will be at the roots of social unrest.
[00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:56.453]  Some threat to democracy may be from social cases.
[00:41:56.453 --> 00:41:58.275]  It can also end in war, he said.
[00:42:00.287 --> 00:42:10.331]  He confirmed the IMF would shortly debate its economic forecast to show the world economy contracting between 0.5 and 1 percent in the year, the first reversal in more than 50 years of sustained growth.
[00:42:10.331 --> 00:42:25.537]  Developed countries would shrink by a post-Cold War record, post-war record of World War II of about 3 percent, he said, but the IMF still believed recovery was possible in 2010, provided bold policies were followed.
[00:42:25.537 --> 00:42:26.958]  And that means doing whatever they say.
[00:42:28.757 --> 00:42:37.562]  We are now here with the open world government of, for, and by the bankers being set up in plain view of everyone.
[00:42:37.562 --> 00:42:45.986]  And if you go protest that the private Federal Reserve is owned by European, New York, and London families, the army is spying on you and watching you.
[00:42:45.986 --> 00:42:48.127]  Now we can't let that be a chilling effect and stop us.
[00:42:48.127 --> 00:42:56.392]  It just shows how a pack of criminals is attempting to take this country over like they did Germany, Russia, China, and hundreds of other countries.
[00:42:58.544 --> 00:43:07.332]  This is what the IMF and World Bank and XM Bank, International Bank of Settlements, the OECD, this is what this group of criminals do.
[00:43:07.332 --> 00:43:09.874]  They're monopoly men.
[00:43:09.874 --> 00:43:24.066]  They set up NORTHCOM to protect their criminal operation from the American people ever getting control of the government again, and then having legitimate government, not rogue government, but legitimate government, prosecute these globalists.
[00:43:25.759 --> 00:43:26.799]  See, that's what tyranny is.
[00:43:26.799 --> 00:43:31.881]  They've got to get their crime syndicate in place so they can consolidate the power.
[00:43:31.881 --> 00:43:32.921]  They're conquerors.
[00:43:32.921 --> 00:43:34.642]  They're usurpers.
[00:43:34.642 --> 00:43:37.763]  This is military and economic domination.
[00:43:37.763 --> 00:43:44.845]  This is the fall of the Republic.
[00:43:44.845 --> 00:43:48.366]  A decade down the road, you'll still see the American flag.
[00:43:48.366 --> 00:43:51.307]  You'll still hear about how we're the home of the free, land of the brave.
[00:43:51.307 --> 00:43:53.548]  Land of the free, home of the brave, but it will not be that case.
[00:43:56.687 --> 00:43:58.910]  You think your standard of living has dropped so far?
[00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:05.437]  It's only going to get worse until these criminals are brought to justice.
[00:44:05.437 --> 00:44:14.287]  And the IMF goes on to say they need a world regulatory body with absolute control over every nation's issuance of currency, the value of currencies,
[00:44:15.399 --> 00:44:16.860]  Interest rates, everything.
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:34.655]  You'll still have your dollars, you'll still have your yin and yang, you'll still have your pounds, you'll still have your euros, you'll still have your pesos, but it will globally be set and controlled by this body, just like trade is set by the World Trade Organization.
[00:44:34.655 --> 00:44:36.317]  Here's the Times of London headline.
[00:44:36.317 --> 00:44:38.639]  Soon there will be nobody left to lend to America.
[00:44:42.711 --> 00:44:45.754]  That's what the National Post in Canada's headline was yesterday.
[00:44:45.754 --> 00:44:47.996]  It was, is this the end of America?
[00:44:47.996 --> 00:44:49.997]  Yes, it is.
[00:44:49.997 --> 00:44:56.983]  It is the end of the United States as we know it.
[00:44:56.983 --> 00:44:59.205]  They are using up all of our capital.
[00:44:59.205 --> 00:45:06.412]  They're indenturing the American people to finance the global banking takeover of the entire planet.
[00:45:06.412 --> 00:45:10.215]  And then we are left as paupers on the continent our forefathers conquered.
[00:45:11.755 --> 00:45:15.936]  In the words of Thomas Jefferson.
[00:45:15.936 --> 00:45:16.616]  You understand?
[00:45:16.616 --> 00:45:18.277]  This is it.
[00:45:18.277 --> 00:45:30.980]  But you've got an entitled, slack job public who have had it so good, we're all soft, we're all too complacent, myself included.
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:54.777]  We have had it good so long that we don't know what hardship is, and the public was taught that it was cute and funny and cool to be lackadaisical and laugh in the face of serious issues, and that everybody was just partying and drinking and working out and having sex and going on vacations and smirking or caught up in the left-right paradigm if you were politically active.
[00:45:55.558 --> 00:46:10.387]  While the bankers, while powerful, serious, shrewd, focused, eugenics-obsessed, control freaks, got us in debt, took over our local governments, brainwashed our police and military, and now they're dropping the hammer.
[00:46:10.387 --> 00:46:13.429]  The hammer's already hit.
[00:46:13.429 --> 00:46:19.252]  And now they're raising it again to just hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer.
[00:46:24.073 --> 00:46:29.836]  We're like a ship going into a hurricane, a cyclone, it's 200 miles an hour.
[00:46:29.836 --> 00:46:42.502]  And people are being slammed up against the bulkhead doors, and they're still giggling and smirking, and we haven't even entered the main maelstrom yet.
[00:46:42.502 --> 00:46:48.625]  And I am desperately trying to get the American people to rise up and take the wheel away from the psychopaths that are in control of the ship.
[00:46:51.394 --> 00:47:01.920]  But the wicked captain's at the helm saying, look, just shut up, he's an extremist, they're extremists, let me continue taking the ship directly into the storm.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.340]  And that's why the elite don't care.
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:20.730]  They've now brought us into the storm, they are either going to fail, and their New World Order system is going to be run up on the rocks, and then we've got some chance of climbing off and surviving, maybe, or they are going to continue taking us directly in and taking the ship to the bottom.
[00:47:25.327 --> 00:47:30.530]  And all I'm trying to do is get people to wake up and realize how desperate the situation is.
[00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:37.753]  The public is outraged over $165 million to AIG when it's the third round of bonuses for that one group.
[00:47:37.753 --> 00:47:40.875]  There's hundreds of groups getting bonuses and bailout money.
[00:47:40.875 --> 00:47:49.079]  $250 billion, CBS News reports, of bailout money is in the... is just in one tax shelter alone.
[00:47:49.079 --> 00:47:52.501]  You know, in the Caymans.
[00:47:55.748 --> 00:47:57.969]  That is nothing!
[00:47:57.969 --> 00:48:00.090]  It isn't the little CEOs.
[00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:16.118]  It's the shareholders of the big private banks and brokerage houses that in the last decade have gotten you to buy into Ponzi schemes while they move their assets into coal mines and power plants and roads and biotech and defense and media.
[00:48:16.118 --> 00:48:20.660]  They, when they built the Ponzi scheme, they took all their money out.
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:24.262]  I saw this a decade ago and would only buy hard assets and commodities.
[00:48:25.731 --> 00:48:31.555]  While selling you into the Ponzi scheme with your retirement funds and your 401Ks.
[00:48:31.555 --> 00:48:33.236]  Look, the average 401K has lost more than 50%.
[00:48:33.236 --> 00:48:40.280]  Folks, you're going to end up losing it all.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:42.942]  So the letter's finally out from Ron Paul, Bob Barr, and Chuck Baldwin.
[00:48:42.942 --> 00:48:48.245]  Get him to post this at the top with a blurb with the addendum article of last week under it, please.
[00:48:48.245 --> 00:48:48.725]  Thank you.
[00:48:48.725 --> 00:48:50.026]  We finally got the letter.
[00:48:50.026 --> 00:48:51.267]  Honorable Ron Paul, Chuck,
[00:48:53.601 --> 00:49:01.504]  Baldwin and Bob Barr, all of them here, got that letter to the Governor Nixon.
[00:49:01.504 --> 00:49:04.425]  The MIAC report.
[00:49:04.425 --> 00:49:11.407]  I still have people saying that report doesn't exist when the Governor's in the Associated Press defending a Governor Nixon in Missouri.
[00:49:11.407 --> 00:49:16.749]  And I suppose they'll say these Army reports that I'm about to cover don't exist either.
[00:49:16.749 --> 00:49:17.209]  Whatever.
[00:49:17.209 --> 00:49:21.691]  If you want to live in denial, you know, Friday we started covering how
[00:49:23.177 --> 00:49:26.580]  Schenectady, New York.
[00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:27.541]  Am I pronouncing that right?
[00:49:27.541 --> 00:49:29.463]  I don't have it in front of me.
[00:49:29.463 --> 00:49:31.044]  Schenectady.
[00:49:31.044 --> 00:49:33.306]  Schenectady, but I just, I can't keep track of it all.
[00:49:33.306 --> 00:49:35.408]  Schenectady.
[00:49:35.408 --> 00:49:38.290]  You know, said, oh, well, we're going to declare martial law.
[00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:40.792]  Obama, you know, thinks it's a good idea.
[00:49:40.792 --> 00:49:45.537]  We post the mainstream news article out of Albany and people say it's not real.
[00:49:45.537 --> 00:49:48.139]  Meanwhile, it's the top story on Drudge, or at least it was an hour ago.
[00:49:50.663 --> 00:49:53.924]  It's just army for this, army for that.
[00:49:53.924 --> 00:49:55.404]  Oh, you want to protest the Federal Reserve?
[00:49:55.404 --> 00:49:56.385]  Peacefully.
[00:49:56.385 --> 00:50:01.246]  Oh, we'll have the army watching you.
[00:50:01.246 --> 00:50:06.868]  You know, I got Kevin Booth coming up because he made a film, American Drug War, that I consulted on.
[00:50:06.868 --> 00:50:08.268]  We sell it at Infowars.com.
[00:50:08.268 --> 00:50:08.969]  It's a great film.
[00:50:08.969 --> 00:50:10.409]  Three hours of extras on it.
[00:50:10.409 --> 00:50:12.990]  It's really two or three films in one.
[00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:14.550]  And it took him five years to make it.
[00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:16.451]  And he got to know Freeway Ricky Ross.
[00:50:17.699 --> 00:50:18.660]  He's in the film.
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:26.124]  The guy that the CIA approached and he was dealing $25 million of cocaine every couple days in the 80s.
[00:50:26.124 --> 00:50:32.547]  He was the CIA's front man in Southern California.
[00:50:32.547 --> 00:50:40.692]  And that came out, the Solicitor General of the CIA admits it in congressional testimony, but he's supposed to already be out of prison, but they're not letting him leave.
[00:50:40.692 --> 00:50:45.795]  Kind of like when a federal judge ordered the Davidians released and they were kept in jail for five, six years longer.
[00:50:48.049 --> 00:50:49.432]  So there's been some new developments on that front.
[00:50:49.432 --> 00:50:56.284]  We'll spend about 30 minutes to the next hour that I promise before Alan Watt comes on, I'm gonna spend 30 minutes on this Army report.
[00:50:56.284 --> 00:50:57.286]  This is huge news.
[00:50:57.286 --> 00:50:59.210]  There's a lot of other news as well coming up.
[00:50:59.210 --> 00:50:59.610]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.149 --> 00:51:09.395]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[00:51:09.395 --> 00:51:13.959]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[00:51:13.959 --> 00:51:18.622]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[00:51:18.622 --> 00:51:20.023]  It's a documented fact.
[00:51:20.203 --> 00:51:27.666]  About 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[00:51:27.666 --> 00:51:39.770]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.
[00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:43.431]  FPP is now available to you from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[00:51:44.031 --> 00:51:47.174]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[00:51:47.174 --> 00:51:50.918]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.

[00:51:54.421 --> 00:51:54.822]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:51:54.822 --> 00:51:56.363]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:52:04.833 --> 00:52:07.458]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:07.458 --> 00:52:14.452]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:15.026 --> 00:52:21.232]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.232 --> 00:52:23.594]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:23.594 --> 00:52:26.097]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:26.097 --> 00:52:37.047]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.677 --> 00:52:39.337]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:39.337 --> 00:52:41.198]  It's about a one world government.
[00:52:41.198 --> 00:52:48.099]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:48.099 --> 00:52:56.361]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:56.361 --> 00:52:57.942]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.942 --> 00:52:59.122]  The people strike back.
[00:53:00.994 --> 00:53:04.697]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:53:04.697 --> 00:53:10.441]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:53:10.441 --> 00:53:14.764]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[00:53:14.764 --> 00:53:17.226]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[00:53:17.226 --> 00:53:23.370]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures and
[00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:23.830]  We're good to go!
[00:53:52.472 --> 00:53:54.917]  GoldenFLAX.com or call 800-387-5516.
[00:53:54.917 --> 00:53:55.118]  That's 800-387-5516.
[00:53:55.118 --> 00:53:55.819]  Free shipping included.
[00:54:20.307 --> 00:54:21.447]  We are back live.
[00:54:21.447 --> 00:54:24.368]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:54:24.368 --> 00:54:27.088]  John, I forgot to tell you during the break, I got three guests coming on.
[00:54:27.088 --> 00:54:29.389]  Kevin wants two people on with him.
[00:54:29.389 --> 00:54:30.329]  So we go ahead and get them on.
[00:54:30.329 --> 00:54:34.510]  I just want to do the first 30 minutes with them and then get to the next issue, but it is important.
[00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:37.511]  Breaking information.
[00:54:37.511 --> 00:54:40.031]  Now, the CIA didn't go to prison for shipping in the drugs.
[00:54:40.031 --> 00:54:42.632]  They just put their guy that worked with them in jail.
[00:54:42.632 --> 00:54:43.752]  You know, that's how this works.
[00:54:44.761 --> 00:54:55.976]  I got on the stair-stepper this morning, and for about the fifth time it was on HBO, and I watched about an hour of it, of Serenity, you know, with the case of the CIA agent, Mr. Baird.
[00:54:57.861 --> 00:54:59.121]  And it's a true story.
[00:54:59.121 --> 00:55:11.987]  People in the CIA, all these young punks they're hiring, they're tripling, as best we can tell, it's secret, but they admit they've tripled the funding for hiring personnel domestically and internationally, and they're running CIA ads on radio, TV, everywhere.
[00:55:11.987 --> 00:55:17.869]  And all these people being recruited in, they're really lowering their standards because they want idiots.
[00:55:17.869 --> 00:55:24.091]  You know, Bayer was one of the top field officers they had, and very intelligent, you know, 160 IQ, and they tried to set him up.
[00:55:24.091 --> 00:55:25.752]  They will set you up, dummies!
[00:55:28.953 --> 00:55:33.375]  You know, I was talking to my, uh, I'm not even going to say who I was talking to, family.
[00:55:33.375 --> 00:55:45.579]  And this is the kind of stuff you learn once you make films like I made and do the things that I've done, then older family, I'll just leave it at that, will open up to you.
[00:55:45.579 --> 00:55:57.344]  And, uh, I have a living relative, he's very old, who was an army officer for twenty-something years and then they recruited him for the CIA and they said, okay, this is your graduation as a full officer.
[00:55:59.036 --> 00:56:02.377]  In black ops and they sent him to Chicago to do things.
[00:56:02.377 --> 00:56:07.239]  He said that he couldn't do And I said, what is that?
[00:56:07.239 --> 00:56:19.964]  And he said well, I I can't tell you but it was narcotics trafficking Now that was in the 70s ladies and gentlemen That's what the CIA is
[00:56:22.833 --> 00:56:23.934]  It's narcotics.
[00:56:23.934 --> 00:56:26.255]  It's everything else you can imagine, evil.
[00:56:26.255 --> 00:56:35.622]  I've played here on air, House Armed Services Committee hearings, where they say to Donald Rumsfeld, the million-plus kidnapped children out of Europe, where are they?
[00:56:35.622 --> 00:56:37.483]  Why are you allowing DynCorp to do this?
[00:56:37.483 --> 00:56:39.284]  And then change their name.
[00:56:39.284 --> 00:56:41.206]  And why are you still giving them bids and contracts?
[00:56:41.206 --> 00:56:42.667]  And he said, well, they're allowed to do that.
[00:56:43.868 --> 00:56:48.792]  You know, they got put in the penalty box for a year, and now we're giving them contracts.
[00:56:48.792 --> 00:56:50.273]  I mean, it's just out in the open.
[00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:55.817]  It's so evil, though, that people have trouble imagining or even dealing with it.
[00:56:56.619 --> 00:56:57.880]  I have trouble.
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.501]  I was in the shower this morning just thinking.
[00:56:59.501 --> 00:57:02.163]  I was like, my God, they're so evil.
[00:57:02.163 --> 00:57:06.486]  And then they wrap themselves in the American flag and they say they're doing it for goodness.
[00:57:06.486 --> 00:57:08.468]  And they've got it all compartmentalized.
[00:57:08.468 --> 00:57:12.931]  And they get all these farm boys to go join special forces and they recruit them into CIA.
[00:57:12.931 --> 00:57:15.733]  And then they have them running around committing murders in the third world.
[00:57:15.733 --> 00:57:19.276]  And then they bring them back here and have them deal drugs and murder people.
[00:57:19.276 --> 00:57:21.818]  And I know one day, there's a good chance they're going to come for me.
[00:57:23.302 --> 00:57:25.883]  They already are all over me.
[00:57:25.883 --> 00:57:26.904]  It's sick.
[00:57:26.904 --> 00:57:28.965]  I'm not even worried about dying.
[00:57:28.965 --> 00:57:33.266]  It's just so disgusting that our country had to be completely taken over by criminals.
[00:57:33.266 --> 00:57:47.453]  And now they're blowing out and stealing everybody's pension funds and 401Ks in front of everybody, and we just go down and peaceably assemble and protest the Federal Reserve and say, forget about Obama, forget about Bush, this is the real power structure, while the Army is watching us.
[00:57:47.453 --> 00:57:49.554]  I mean, I have their own internal report right here.
[00:57:51.721 --> 00:57:53.062]  That is high treason!
[00:57:53.062 --> 00:57:55.964]  You are, you are destroying the country completely.
[00:57:55.964 --> 00:57:57.505]  And that's the thing about corruption, you know.
[00:57:57.505 --> 00:58:01.347]  First they get them to commit corrupt acts in the 50s and 60s overseas.
[00:58:01.347 --> 00:58:04.650]  Then they start committing corrupt acts here.
[00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:07.712]  And now it's just corrupt acts everywhere.
[00:58:07.712 --> 00:58:14.876]  And you know, 9 out of 10 people in the army, that's where they mainly recruit, say no when they finally find out it's drug dealing.
[00:58:14.876 --> 00:58:19.319]  And they imprison them or they kill them, you know, like Terry Reid they tried to go after.
[00:58:19.319 --> 00:58:20.020]  Countless others.
[00:58:21.502 --> 00:58:24.083]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:52.543 --> 00:58:57.306]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.306 --> 00:59:00.268]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.268 --> 00:59:03.309]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.309 --> 00:59:09.393]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.393 --> 00:59:12.635]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.

[00:59:53.726 --> 00:59:56.127]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.127 --> 01:00:05.491]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.491 --> 01:00:06.792]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.792 --> 01:00:08.573]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.573 --> 01:00:10.334]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.334 --> 01:00:11.894]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.894 --> 01:00:13.475]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.475 --> 01:00:17.657]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.657 --> 01:00:21.719]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:24.081]  We're good.
[01:00:39.198 --> 01:00:40.318]  We are back live.
[01:00:40.318 --> 01:00:55.003]  It is hour number two and coming up in 30 minutes I'm going to detail the secret MIAC report that we broke two weeks ago, now international news, and a new Army report specifically naming our protest in Dallas against the private Federal Reserve in November.
[01:00:56.187 --> 01:01:02.108]  The fact that this was leaked to us is an indicator of how upset the military and police are about what's happening.
[01:01:02.108 --> 01:01:07.090]  Military, police, and others continue to leak this to us, the Libertarian Party, whoever.
[01:01:07.090 --> 01:01:10.691]  Just get the information out to everybody.
[01:01:10.691 --> 01:01:20.893]  Speaking of CIA and black ops, Freeway Ricky Ross was, at the time, the largest distributor of cocaine.
[01:01:20.893 --> 01:01:24.414]  Within a two-day period, sometimes as much as $25 million will be distributed
[01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:31.550]  Through Southern California to the West Coast, out to Chicago, and then across the nation, the CIA directly was bringing it in.
[01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:35.591]  This came out in Congressional testimony with a CIA Solicitor General on C-SPAN in 1996.
[01:01:35.591 --> 01:01:41.153]  Kevin Booth made a film about this, five years in the making, that I consulted on, American Drug War.
[01:01:41.153 --> 01:01:43.333]  We have it available at InfoWars.com.
[01:01:43.333 --> 01:01:47.394]  It also was aired over and over again, and is an award-winning film on Showtime.
[01:01:49.451 --> 01:01:54.136]  Now, Free Ricky Ross is already supposed to be out of prison, basically, and they're not doing that.
[01:01:54.136 --> 01:02:00.803]  Remember back in 1999, a federal judge ruled the Davidians had to be released from prison.
[01:02:00.803 --> 01:02:08.712]  They had been found not guilty of murder, but then the judge, Walter E. Smith, in the criminal trial, he also sat up with a civil.
[01:02:08.712 --> 01:02:10.474]  That was a violation of the Constitution.
[01:02:12.386 --> 01:02:17.691]  He said, well I find you guilty of using weapons in the commission of a murder, but you have to be found guilty of the murder first.
[01:02:17.691 --> 01:02:19.672]  Put him in jail for 45 years apiece.
[01:02:19.672 --> 01:02:26.138]  With 43 and 45 years worth of sentences, a whole bunch of the Branch Davidians are survivors of that Delta Force attack.
[01:02:26.138 --> 01:02:31.402]  Always goes back to the Special Combat Applications Group.
[01:02:31.402 --> 01:02:32.183]  The shadow government.
[01:02:34.665 --> 01:02:41.628]  And they served six and seven years after federal judges ordered them released.
[01:02:41.628 --> 01:02:43.208]  They just don't care.
[01:02:43.208 --> 01:02:46.550]  And so we're here to talk about that specifically today.
[01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:51.571]  And Kevin has gone in and interviewed Ricky Ross in prison, very hard to do.
[01:02:51.571 --> 01:02:57.234]  Then when we did air that here first, I appreciate Kevin putting that out a few years ago here first.
[01:02:57.234 --> 01:02:58.414]  He was supposed to be out.
[01:02:58.414 --> 01:03:00.695]  So I want to bring Kevin Booth up in the next segment I'll bring in.
[01:03:02.421 --> 01:03:25.252]  The head of the company that Ricky Ross is going to put a reality TV show together with, and that's Straw, who was incarcerated along with Rick for heroin distribution for several years and is now the president of Freeway Enterprises, and Monique Hall, radio talk show host and author, award-winning author, who are working on this case.
[01:03:25.252 --> 01:03:27.513]  I want to bring up Kevin Booth right now.
[01:03:27.513 --> 01:03:31.455]  Kevin, I tell you, I'm not surprised they're not letting him out.
[01:03:32.694 --> 01:03:36.456]  Yeah, no, it just seemed too good to be true.
[01:03:36.456 --> 01:03:45.202]  I was out of the blue, got a call from Rick saying that he was going to have a new sentencing hearing in early February.
[01:03:45.202 --> 01:03:58.290]  We went to San Diego with a film crew and it was amazing because I was at a sentencing hearing a couple of years ago when the federal prosecutor came in there and they brought Ricky in in shackles.
[01:03:58.290 --> 01:04:00.992]  He had been held in a little cage for several weeks.
[01:04:01.696 --> 01:04:10.343]  And he looked like he had been all beaten up, and the prosecutor sat there and hammered on him, and the judge hammered on him, and then they just kind of carted him away.
[01:04:10.343 --> 01:04:18.970]  But that was back in 2005, and my understanding from that hearing was that it was supposed to be like another maximum of another two years.
[01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:26.516]  Okay, so 2007 comes and goes, 2008 comes and goes, so 2009 rolls around, he has another resentencing hearing.
[01:04:26.516 --> 01:04:28.017]  I was there in person once again.
[01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:33.974]  The judge says that Ricky can go to a halfway house on March 29th.
[01:04:33.974 --> 01:04:38.017]  And now with two weeks, we're getting ready to pack up to start shooting this reality show.
[01:04:39.089 --> 01:04:51.417]  Uh, suddenly the warden lost the paperwork or something and told her... Well, Kevin, look, he... Kevin, he's not gonna make it out of there alive unless you guys, for now, cats out of the bag, stop talking about the reality TV show, man.
[01:04:51.417 --> 01:04:52.338]  That's the whole reason.
[01:04:52.338 --> 01:04:59.543]  Uh, I mean, I'm glad he's gonna do it, and it's good to now be public, since the horse has already left the barn, but stay there.
[01:05:01.425 --> 01:05:02.326]  Attention, gardeners!
[01:05:02.326 --> 01:05:04.907]  This is an urgent GCN Self-Reliance Update.
[01:05:04.907 --> 01:05:09.451]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[01:05:09.451 --> 01:05:17.656]  It's called Proto-Grow, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:05:17.656 --> 01:05:20.478]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:05:20.762 --> 01:05:28.387]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:05:28.387 --> 01:05:34.211]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:05:34.211 --> 01:05:40.054]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:05:40.054 --> 01:05:43.617]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:05:43.617 --> 01:05:46.939]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:05:47.279 --> 01:05:50.020]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:54.501]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:06:14.978 --> 01:06:21.561]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:23.521]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:23.521 --> 01:06:26.022]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:26.022 --> 01:06:37.007]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:39.269]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:39.269 --> 01:06:41.130]  It's about a one world government.
[01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:48.031]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:06:48.031 --> 01:06:56.293]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:56.293 --> 01:06:57.874]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:57.874 --> 01:06:59.054]  The people strike back.
[01:07:00.936 --> 01:07:06.320]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:14.888]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[01:07:14.888 --> 01:07:18.470]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:21.693]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[01:07:21.693 --> 01:07:24.195]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?
[01:07:24.195 --> 01:07:27.178]  Make the change to organic health and beauty products.

[01:08:02.523 --> 01:08:09.147]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.147 --> 01:08:12.129]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:21.012]  Just a program note, the Obama Deception has now been out for about 10 days.
[01:08:21.012 --> 01:08:26.454]  It is the number one video on YouTube and Google, though they removed it from the number one viewed page.
[01:08:26.454 --> 01:08:31.096]  They've also removed the honors from the channels that have posted it.
[01:08:31.096 --> 01:08:37.218]  That way they knock it off the front pages, but if you look at the number of views each day, it would be number one.
[01:08:38.118 --> 01:08:44.720]  There's some up there with over a million views, others up there with half a million views, four hundred and something thousand views.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:49.702]  I've seen, just on YouTube alone, probably fifteen different copies that have over a hundred thousand views apiece.
[01:08:49.702 --> 01:09:03.327]  So, millions and millions and millions of free views of my new film, The Obama Deception, showing how he works for the very same bankers that controlled Bush, and is just their front man that they plan to basically politically destroy him, like they're already doing Geithner after he's done his work.
[01:09:03.327 --> 01:09:05.928]  He's meant to take the blame for the globalist agenda.
[01:09:07.011 --> 01:09:12.595]  Now I'm asking all the listeners to get the Obama deception out to everybody.
[01:09:12.595 --> 01:09:17.538]  I got thousands of them sitting out there on a pallet of the high-quality DVD with the extras.
[01:09:17.538 --> 01:09:18.779]  This film needs to be seen.
[01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:20.680]  Order it at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:22.881]  That also supports us, the filmmakers.
[01:09:22.881 --> 01:09:25.063]  But there's many versions up on the web for free.
[01:09:25.063 --> 01:09:26.924]  The best one is ChangeTheChannel.
[01:09:26.924 --> 01:09:31.027]  ChangeTheChannel is the name of the handle of the site that did the best in code for free.
[01:09:31.727 --> 01:09:37.851]  It's amazingly clear for YouTube, and it's got 450-something thousand views.
[01:09:37.851 --> 01:09:40.432]  It's getting about 60-70 thousand views a day.
[01:09:40.432 --> 01:09:41.633]  That is not enough.
[01:09:41.633 --> 01:09:44.434]  All the cruddy copies are getting more views than that.
[01:09:44.434 --> 01:09:47.996]  I want it to be the number one link when you type Obama Deception into Google.
[01:09:47.996 --> 01:09:49.237]  It's the third link right now.
[01:09:49.237 --> 01:09:53.780]  It says Obama Deception in high quality is the name of it.
[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:54.980]  So if you Google that, you'll find it.
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:10:00.384]  But I'm going to have Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson post it at the top of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:10:01.264 --> 01:10:05.308]  And I want everybody today to launch it, to explain to people it's being censored.
[01:10:05.308 --> 01:10:08.771]  That needs to be in a little blurb above the free posting of it.
[01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:12.214]  And see it in the highest quality online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:10:12.214 --> 01:10:13.615]  You get a 15-cent-a-day membership.
[01:10:13.615 --> 01:10:19.461]  We simulcast the last two hours of the show every day at PrisonPlanet.tv visually in the TV studio.
[01:10:19.461 --> 01:10:23.965]  And Jason Bermas, 9 to midnight, does three hours out of the studio simulcasting on the radio with Genesis.
[01:10:23.965 --> 01:10:26.467]  So another reason to be a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[01:10:26.467 --> 01:10:26.927]  15 cents a day.
[01:10:27.708 --> 01:10:29.549]  Now, going back to Kevin Booth, filmmaker.
[01:10:29.549 --> 01:10:31.810]  Kevin, to be clear, we got cut off by the break.
[01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:36.273]  I'm not criticizing the fact that Ricky's saying he's gonna do this and you guys are doing that.
[01:10:36.273 --> 01:10:37.554]  I mean, that's no secret.
[01:10:37.554 --> 01:10:47.900]  My whole point is, in a way, him being public gives him some safety, but then in a way, being public also makes them go after him and mistreat him, as you know, so it's kind of a catch-22.
[01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:49.341]  Why was the decision made
[01:10:49.821 --> 01:10:54.523]  To go ahead and announce, I guess in the last year or so, that you guys were going to do a reality TV show.
[01:10:54.523 --> 01:10:55.884]  You know your phones are tapped.
[01:10:55.884 --> 01:10:57.644]  You've seen guys out there messing with your phone box.
[01:10:57.644 --> 01:10:59.465]  I mean, that's obvious.
[01:10:59.465 --> 01:11:01.626]  I mean, why was that decision made?
[01:11:01.626 --> 01:11:04.987]  Well, I mean, you've got to know that the reality show is just the tip of the spear.
[01:11:04.987 --> 01:11:08.989]  I mean, Ricky, everybody should check out FreewayEnterprises.com.
[01:11:08.989 --> 01:11:11.850]  It's a new social networking site started by his team.
[01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:18.413]  I mean, Ricky is going to be starting a record company, a movie company, a whole new multimedia conglomerate.
[01:11:18.823 --> 01:11:28.107]  And what makes Ricky so important right now is, I mean, you're talking about in your last segment that, you know, we should be trying to get the American people to take the wheel away from the criminals.
[01:11:28.107 --> 01:11:31.369]  Well, Ricky is like a major icon of the streets.
[01:11:31.369 --> 01:11:36.111]  And I think the government is basically afraid because Ricky could be a new type of leader.
[01:11:36.111 --> 01:11:40.773]  Now, and part of the show is going to be him showing that he can raise a million dollars in today's economy.
[01:11:41.243 --> 01:11:45.825]  But not being a part of, like, this whole corrupt system that's going on right now.
[01:11:45.825 --> 01:11:49.046]  So the reality show is just going to document what he's doing.
[01:11:49.046 --> 01:11:51.867]  He's already got this huge other thing going that I'm not a part of.
[01:11:51.867 --> 01:11:53.328]  I'm just a fly on the wall.
[01:11:53.328 --> 01:11:54.709]  No, no, no.
[01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:56.429]  I wouldn't even talk about the show specifically.
[01:11:56.429 --> 01:12:01.671]  I meant the fact that he's being so public about how he's going to basically expose the whole corrupt system.
[01:12:01.671 --> 01:12:05.013]  He's got to know that they're going to go after him even more then.
[01:12:05.413 --> 01:12:07.114]  I mean, I'm commending his courage.
[01:12:07.114 --> 01:12:09.575]  I'm just saying, that's the big issue here.
[01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:13.457]  I mean, I'm not even saying it's a bad thing that he's being public.
[01:12:13.457 --> 01:12:19.500]  I'm saying, talking to him and others, what's the catch-22 here of damned if you do, damned if you don't?
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:22.861]  Yeah, no, I mean, but what else is he going to do, right?
[01:12:22.861 --> 01:12:27.864]  I mean, he's got to go public with this thing or else they'll just keep him in the hole forever.
[01:12:27.864 --> 01:12:30.905]  I mean, right now we've got Maxine Waters working on it.
[01:12:30.905 --> 01:12:32.386]  I was hoping maybe Ron Paul could
[01:12:33.072 --> 01:12:38.053]  Maybe put in a phone call or if any of your listeners have any sort of inroads to the Bureau of Prisons.
[01:12:38.053 --> 01:12:43.594]  You know, I mean, this is just like dealing with a brick wall dealing with the Bureau of Prisons.
[01:12:43.594 --> 01:12:44.454]  Yeah, they move him around.
[01:12:44.454 --> 01:12:45.954]  I want to go to some of the other folks here in a minute.
[01:12:45.954 --> 01:12:48.255]  We'll hold you past the 30 minute mark if we need to.
[01:12:48.255 --> 01:12:51.755]  But specifically, he's supposed to go to a halfway house.
[01:12:51.755 --> 01:12:52.916]  It hasn't happened.
[01:12:52.916 --> 01:12:54.316]  They claim they've lost the paperwork.
[01:12:54.316 --> 01:12:56.396]  How long can that go on?
[01:12:56.396 --> 01:12:58.136]  You know, another 90 days or something like that.
[01:12:58.136 --> 01:13:01.057]  They could probably drag this out until September if they wanted to.
[01:13:02.506 --> 01:13:03.947]  You know, it's just crazy.
[01:13:03.947 --> 01:13:09.551]  I mean, he's going to be moved to a halfway house in San Diego because that's where this last crime happened.
[01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:21.740]  And what I learned from this too is that I had no idea that judges, it's just up to a judge's personal discretion, whether they want to like dole out concurrent or consecutive, um, you know, punishment.
[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:30.306]  And so one of the things that's been holding them in all this time is that they were punishing him on consecutive sentences because he had different cases
[01:13:31.185 --> 01:13:36.247]  Uh, one in Ohio, one in San Diego, one in Los Angeles, all these different cases working against him.
[01:13:36.247 --> 01:13:42.968]  And so his lawyer finally got the judges to all come together and say, well, it was okay for this to be concurrent.
[01:13:42.968 --> 01:13:47.090]  And that's why, you know, they, they pulled this thing saying he'd get out on, uh, March 29th.
[01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:53.752]  But the fact that I never really understood the whole difference between consecutive or concurrent and how a judge can just make that choice.
[01:13:53.752 --> 01:13:55.152]  This is, it's frightening.
[01:13:56.738 --> 01:13:57.879]  Well, it certainly is.
[01:13:57.879 --> 01:14:15.230]  I mean, I just want to be clear about this, and of course he agreed in the taped interview, you know, Gary Webb, the Pulitzer Prize winner for Dark Empire dealing with the CIA drug dealing, I mean, clearly shot in the head twice at a previous residence a year before.
[01:14:15.230 --> 01:14:20.534]  He'd seen guys climbing down the back water, you know, pole on the back of his house, running off the water pipe.
[01:14:20.534 --> 01:14:23.356]  He'd been getting threats, and then he's murdered
[01:14:24.136 --> 01:14:30.580]  And his supposed good friend, who he'd actually criticized in newspapers, comes out and says, oh yes, it's quite normal to shoot yourself twice in the head.
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:37.464]  I mean, I just hope Ricky, I mean, he's not stupid, he's a very smart guy, understands that he is in great danger.
[01:14:37.464 --> 01:14:44.389]  And so I guess, you know, the fact that he's going to go public is already out there, so I guess you need to make the biggest noise possible, so that's why you're here.
[01:14:44.389 --> 01:14:47.651]  So how can we try to get him out?
[01:14:47.651 --> 01:14:49.412]  I mean, where is he currently being held?
[01:14:49.972 --> 01:14:53.514]  Well, this is in the, uh, all this time he's been in the Texarkana prison.
[01:14:53.514 --> 01:15:05.461]  When he first, you know, got put on this case, they put him in a, uh, Victorville, um, prison where he ended up doing all kinds of talk shows and, and, and, you know, he was on the Montel Williams Show.
[01:15:05.461 --> 01:15:12.705]  And so they picked him up and they put him in the Gulag in Texarkana, which basically just will not allow any kind of media or anything.
[01:15:12.705 --> 01:15:15.767]  I've had to conduct all my interviews just by phone from this prison.
[01:15:16.764 --> 01:15:27.910]  And right now we're just kind of standing by to just see what's going to happen and it's just one of these things where the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing and it's just very frustrating.
[01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:34.514]  Well, you've got to get a prison's procedural lawyer because I guarantee you they're not allowed to just say they lost the paperwork.
[01:15:37.921 --> 01:15:51.724]  Warden and people need to know that a criminal investigation, there needs to be a call if you really want to do something, a call for a criminal investigation because there are criminal statutes on falsely imprisoning somebody when they've been ordered released with this type of manipulation.
[01:15:51.724 --> 01:15:56.025]  Every day there's a felony and a $250,000 fine under the U.S.
[01:15:56.025 --> 01:15:56.926]  Code.
[01:15:56.926 --> 01:15:58.646]  And so, what are his lawyers saying?
[01:15:58.646 --> 01:16:00.867]  I mean, are they going after that?
[01:16:00.867 --> 01:16:06.548]  Yeah, I mean, his public defender back in San Diego is a really good guy and, you know, he's just
[01:16:07.509 --> 01:16:10.971]  You know, he's working on it, but it's just, everything goes so slow.
[01:16:30.515 --> 01:16:32.877]  So that's the whole issue here.
[01:16:32.877 --> 01:16:39.844]  Tell me about Strawe, that's what he goes by, who is heading up the Freeway Enterprises.
[01:16:39.844 --> 01:16:44.168]  Tell us about Strawe before I introduce him.
[01:16:44.168 --> 01:16:49.193]  I guess you could say he's one of Ricky's disciples.
[01:16:49.193 --> 01:16:51.856]  He got arrested for drugs a while back.
[01:16:52.679 --> 01:16:53.920]  Telling drugs in Chicago.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:59.162]  He's from Chicago, where I just got back from doing a lecture tour there and filming Ricky's crew there in Chicago.
[01:16:59.162 --> 01:17:03.984]  Yeah, no doubt selling opium that had been shipped in by the CIA from Afghanistan.
[01:17:03.984 --> 01:17:11.448]  Yeah, and so he ended up in prison with Rick, and Rick really had an incredible effect on him.
[01:17:11.448 --> 01:17:17.531]  And one thing I have to say is that I've been just meeting just incredible numbers of people that are all
[01:17:18.157 --> 01:17:19.377]  Yeah, it's been very interesting.
[01:17:44.787 --> 01:17:50.470]  Are you worried about your safety being at the tip of the spear of this whole thing?
[01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:51.991]  No, of course not.
[01:17:51.991 --> 01:18:09.640]  As a matter of fact, as far as the whole Ricky Ross trying to bring this corruption thing to the up front, it's really not what he's doing.
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:14.223]  What Ricky's trying to do is move on with his life, and that's basically what we
[01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:35.385]  One, we're getting these little operations together, not to bring forth whatever that occurred with him in the past as far as this corruption goes, but to look forward to the future as far as corruption for the youth and for
[01:18:36.223 --> 01:18:39.384]  For the guy that's incarcerated.
[01:18:39.384 --> 01:18:47.268]  Tell us what Freeway Enterprises is trying to do.
[01:18:47.268 --> 01:18:57.332]  Freeway Enterprises is trying to create opportunity for the youth.
[01:18:57.332 --> 01:19:01.914]  And create jobs for those that are qualified to do the jobs.
[01:19:01.914 --> 01:19:05.435]  And also those that are qualified to do the job that's incarcerated.
[01:19:06.516 --> 01:19:08.177]  For those that's incarcerated, they get out.
[01:19:08.177 --> 01:19:13.342]  They sometimes having a hard time getting jobs because of their background.
[01:19:13.342 --> 01:19:27.994]  By us having an understanding of that, we're trying to create a multimedia conglomerate in order to create jobs for everyone and not discriminate against no one.
[01:19:27.994 --> 01:19:29.616]  That's good.
[01:19:29.616 --> 01:19:32.158]  And we're also trying to speak to the youth.
[01:19:32.158 --> 01:19:33.179]  So these are things that
[01:19:34.574 --> 01:19:37.215]  We know about what we've studied.
[01:19:37.215 --> 01:19:43.177]  We've read numerous books on trying to build up credit and try to get the thing off the ground.
[01:19:43.177 --> 01:19:50.500]  We did numerous research in order to get the thing going that we're trying to get going.
[01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:57.822]  The other things as far as his background... Stay there, we got a break.
[01:19:57.822 --> 01:19:59.963]  We'll come back to everybody after this break and talk to Ms.
[01:19:59.963 --> 01:20:00.203]  Hall.
[01:20:01.559 --> 01:20:04.801]  Every 22 seconds, a violent crime is committed.
[01:20:04.801 --> 01:20:07.142]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[01:20:07.142 --> 01:20:10.744]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[01:20:10.744 --> 01:20:11.685]  Be smart.
[01:20:11.685 --> 01:20:12.665]  Be safe.
[01:20:12.665 --> 01:20:14.866]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[01:20:57.838 --> 01:21:07.141]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:07.911 --> 01:21:13.794]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:13.794 --> 01:21:20.417]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:22.278]  Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:22.278 --> 01:21:24.720]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:35.625]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:39.592]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:39.592 --> 01:21:41.434]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:21:41.434 --> 01:21:48.361]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:21:56.630 --> 01:21:58.191]  The Obama Deception.
[01:21:58.191 --> 01:21:59.373]  The people strike back.
[01:22:01.397 --> 01:22:03.520]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:03.800]  March 23rd, 2009.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:04.841]  Gold opened this morning at $9.5050.
[01:22:04.841 --> 01:22:08.466]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.7767, $4.8884 for the half-ounce, and $2.4442 for a quarter-ounce.
[01:22:08.466 --> 01:22:08.867]  That's $9.7767, $4.8884, or $2.4442.
[01:22:20.293 --> 01:22:23.974]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[01:22:23.974 --> 01:22:27.095]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[01:22:27.095 --> 01:22:36.579]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[01:22:36.579 --> 01:22:41.901]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[01:22:42.401 --> 01:22:44.742]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[01:22:44.742 --> 01:22:47.603]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[01:22:47.603 --> 01:22:50.965]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.965 --> 01:22:54.746]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[01:22:54.746 --> 01:22:55.047]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:55.047 --> 01:22:55.227]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:02.099 --> 01:23:07.603]  With our economy spiraling out of control, living in the soup kitchens may be right around the corner.
[01:23:07.603 --> 01:23:10.624]  No one saw the financial collapse of 1929.
[01:23:10.624 --> 01:23:16.088]  Many didn't make it, and millions ended up in soup lines, becoming vagrants, begging for food.
[01:23:16.844 --> 01:23:20.486]  Unlike 1929, we can see this collapse coming.
[01:23:20.486 --> 01:23:21.787]  We have been warned.
[01:23:21.787 --> 01:23:28.790]  And right now, we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into our homes before it's too late.
[01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:31.992]  Why is the Canadian government telling their citizens to stock up?
[01:23:31.992 --> 01:23:32.432]  Why?
[01:23:32.432 --> 01:23:36.194]  And why are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage?
[01:23:37.975 --> 01:23:44.477]  Having food storage today may be just as important to your family's survival as boarding the Ark was in the days of Noah.

[01:24:17.535 --> 01:24:23.303]  Don't you know that it's time to get on board?
[01:24:23.303 --> 01:24:29.371]  And let this train keep on riding, riding on through.
[01:24:40.365 --> 01:24:43.486]  Okay, we're going to have our guest a little bit with us into the next segment.
[01:24:43.486 --> 01:24:52.068]  Finishing up what the fellow heading up Freeway Enterprises for Ricky Ross before he gets out of prison is doing.
[01:24:52.068 --> 01:24:58.329]  Finish up, sir, with what you were saying specifically with what Ricky Ross is going to try to do once he gets out.
[01:24:58.329 --> 01:25:02.850]  Let's go back to Kevin and I want to get Monique Hall on as well.
[01:25:02.850 --> 01:25:06.071]  Okay, what I was saying was we basically trying to
[01:25:06.909 --> 01:25:11.552]  Yeah, your phone's fading out again, sir, and I think you have a radio on in the background, but go ahead.
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:51.323]  Okay, as I was saying, we're trying to give, we're trying to give opportunity for those people that ain't experienced, for those kids that's coming up that didn't experience the stuff we had went through while the drug wars was going on.
[01:25:51.323 --> 01:25:51.903]  Well, that's good.
[01:25:51.903 --> 01:25:58.344]  I mean, the best message out there is from people who've been involved in the narcotics trade to explain to the young people it's not cool.
[01:25:58.344 --> 01:26:00.405]  Let me bring up Monique Hall.
[01:26:00.405 --> 01:26:01.885]  Monique, good to have you on with us.
[01:26:01.885 --> 01:26:03.365]  You're a radio talk show host and author.
[01:26:03.365 --> 01:26:05.066]  Thank you for inviting me on.
[01:26:05.066 --> 01:26:05.346]  You bet.
[01:26:05.346 --> 01:26:06.446]  How are you involved in all this?
[01:26:07.499 --> 01:26:11.440]  Actually, Ricky is a good friend of mine, and we're doing the autobiography.
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.581]  It's a group of us.
[01:26:12.581 --> 01:26:24.584]  Jimmy Desainte, who's also incarcerated with him, another gentleman by the name of Edge Teague, and myself and Ricky are doing the back end of the autobiography, and that's how I actually got involved.
[01:26:24.584 --> 01:26:25.585]  Ricky reached out to me.
[01:26:25.585 --> 01:26:26.965]  We were friends, and he reached out to me.
[01:26:26.965 --> 01:26:29.546]  I write for a local magazine here.
[01:26:29.546 --> 01:26:36.108]  It's called Street Elements, and it reaches out to a lot of the prisons, and through an article from in there, Ricky and I developed a friendship.
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:43.621]  What do you think about the fact that he's supposed to be out of prison now and that they're quote lost the paperwork?
[01:26:43.621 --> 01:27:06.427]  I think that's like a really big issue that needs to be addressed for the fact that you know we already know that he did a crime and after doing that crime he deserves his time to get out to society and do what he needs to do and so I know there's a method of doing so I think a lot of the issues that they're saying is that it's a recommendation rather than a mandated sentence as far as the halfway house
[01:27:06.874 --> 01:27:15.263]  But if they're really trying to help him, they would actually try to do like they do with any other inmate and make sure that he uses a lot of the time to get himself, you know, acclimated back into life.
[01:27:15.263 --> 01:27:15.443]  Sure.
[01:27:15.443 --> 01:27:17.606]  Well, how long has he been in prison?
[01:27:17.606 --> 01:27:20.489]  He's been in prison this particular format has been 14 years.
[01:27:20.489 --> 01:27:21.149]  It's been a total of 20.
[01:27:21.869 --> 01:27:24.570]  I think he did five initially in the beginning.
[01:27:24.570 --> 01:27:28.131]  He was out for six months, and then he went back in for 14.
[01:27:28.131 --> 01:27:29.692]  Well, let's be clear here.
[01:27:29.692 --> 01:27:34.614]  The CIA in congressional testimony admits they were giving him the drugs.
[01:27:34.614 --> 01:27:36.455]  They created the conduit.
[01:27:36.455 --> 01:27:37.275]  So you gotta love it.
[01:27:37.275 --> 01:27:39.856]  The mafiadons in the government, they...
[01:27:41.007 --> 01:27:52.011]  Then put their own dealers in jail and run around grandstanding and other folks going, listen to these evil drug dealers, you know, throw away the key, but they're engaged in double think.
[01:27:52.011 --> 01:27:54.511]  I mean, Kevin, this is ridiculous.
[01:27:54.511 --> 01:27:56.392]  He should have never spent any present time.
[01:27:56.392 --> 01:27:58.072]  The government is bringing this crap in.
[01:27:58.072 --> 01:28:08.856]  Yeah, no, I mean, while, you know, his partner, Blandone, who was like his father, you know, stepfather to him or whatever back in the, in the nineties, supposedly he's off in the South of France.
[01:28:09.591 --> 01:28:12.972]  Living large and doing whatever he wants to do.
[01:28:12.972 --> 01:28:22.735]  And Ricky, like I explained in my film, Ricky became the one fall guy, or you could call him the scapegoat for this entire thing.
[01:28:22.735 --> 01:28:23.915]  Well, that's what they always do.
[01:28:23.915 --> 01:28:25.735]  I was watching Syriana this morning.
[01:28:25.735 --> 01:28:26.596]  Again, a true story.
[01:28:26.596 --> 01:28:30.017]  They're there with the oil tycoons about to overthrow a country.
[01:28:30.017 --> 01:28:31.737]  And they go, look, there's an investigation.
[01:28:31.737 --> 01:28:33.217]  We've got to burn somebody.
[01:28:33.217 --> 01:28:34.358]  Give me somebody to burn.
[01:28:34.358 --> 01:28:35.198]  This is how they work.
[01:28:36.291 --> 01:28:37.372]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[01:28:37.372 --> 01:28:57.725]  And like in my film, too, you know, it was said that by Robert Steele, who's on your show all the time, the CIA operative, who basically is just saying that, you know, perhaps Ricky didn't make enough bribes on the local level through various lawyers that could channel the bribes into various politicians, you know?
[01:28:57.725 --> 01:28:59.726]  Maybe he didn't take out enough insurance, who knows?
[01:29:00.208 --> 01:29:04.550]  Well, no, it came out with Iran-Contra that they were dealing drugs, so they had to burn their dealer.
[01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:07.212]  I mean, they had to burn one of their major distributors.
[01:29:07.212 --> 01:29:08.813]  I mean, this is congressional testimony.
[01:29:08.813 --> 01:29:11.875]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:29:11.875 --> 01:29:14.656]  Well, let's fire out the websites.
[01:29:14.656 --> 01:29:19.659]  The Freeway Enterprises site, Monique, your magazine site.
[01:29:19.659 --> 01:29:22.520]  Yeah, definitely want to go and check out FreewayEnterprise.com.
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:23.441]  It's a great site.
[01:29:23.826 --> 01:29:25.626]  You can get a lot of a feel of Ricky.
[01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:29.347]  He's really not trying to focus so much on the past, but build a new future.
[01:29:29.347 --> 01:29:35.749]  On the site, there's different ways and different opportunities for you to either gain employment, also different ways for you to talk.
[01:29:35.749 --> 01:29:38.630]  They also have missing children, as well, on there.
[01:29:38.630 --> 01:29:45.832]  He's gathered a group of individuals who've either actually been incarcerated before, or lost their way, and he's trying to direct them.
[01:29:45.832 --> 01:29:46.152]  Alright.
[01:29:46.152 --> 01:29:46.912]  Miss Hall, stay there.
[01:29:46.912 --> 01:29:47.452]  We've got a break again.
[01:29:47.452 --> 01:29:49.993]  We'll come back and have a few final comments from each of you.
[01:29:51.499 --> 01:29:55.443]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.443 --> 01:30:01.408]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.408 --> 01:30:03.430]  Gardeners, you have the seeds.

[01:30:37.051 --> 01:30:38.252]  You have the seeds.
[01:30:38.252 --> 01:30:40.033]  Now you need the fertilizer.

[01:31:01.869 --> 01:31:07.693]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:07.693 --> 01:31:14.697]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:15.268 --> 01:31:21.850]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:21.850 --> 01:31:23.811]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:23.811 --> 01:31:26.332]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:26.332 --> 01:31:37.275]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:37.893 --> 01:31:39.555]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:39.555 --> 01:31:41.417]  It's about a one world government.
[01:31:41.417 --> 01:31:48.344]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:31:48.344 --> 01:31:56.612]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:56.612 --> 01:31:58.173]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:58.173 --> 01:31:59.395]  The people strike back.
[01:32:01.314 --> 01:32:02.676]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:32:02.676 --> 01:32:05.081]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[01:32:05.081 --> 01:32:09.248]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[01:32:09.248 --> 01:32:11.732]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call.
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:25.408]  If you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food.
[01:32:25.408 --> 01:32:31.793]  If you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:32:31.793 --> 01:32:35.396]  If you believe the official report on 9-11, you won't need food.
[01:32:35.396 --> 01:32:39.800]  If you think the warnings on the Alex Jones Show are foolish, don't call eFoods Direct.
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:41.081]  For the rest of you, go to eFoods.com.
[01:32:43.251 --> 01:32:44.492]  Come, you masters of war!
[01:32:44.492 --> 01:32:45.393]  Here to build the big guns!
[01:33:13.127 --> 01:33:35.266]  I mean, if the military that works for the big banks will kill a million three hundred thousand Iraqis in the last six plus years now,
[01:33:37.267 --> 01:33:38.288]  They'll enslave us.
[01:33:38.288 --> 01:33:40.190]  They'll steal your pension funds, and they are.
[01:33:40.190 --> 01:33:41.792]  They'll set up a world government run by the banks.
[01:33:41.792 --> 01:33:47.437]  I mean, the level of tyranny we will live under is exactly what we put up with.
[01:33:47.437 --> 01:33:49.459]  And it's congressional testimony.
[01:33:49.459 --> 01:33:52.582]  The CIA admits they brought the drugs to Ricky Ross.
[01:33:52.582 --> 01:33:53.804]  They set up the whole deal.
[01:33:55.031 --> 01:33:56.793]  Now, is that moral?
[01:33:56.793 --> 01:33:57.173]  No.
[01:33:57.173 --> 01:33:58.174]  Is what he did good?
[01:33:58.174 --> 01:33:58.915]  No.
[01:33:58.915 --> 01:34:09.965]  The issue is it's hypocritical and a fraud, and back when cocaine, heroin, everything else was sold in drugstores all over the country until the thirties, we had about a third of the people per capita on drugs then that we have today.
[01:34:09.965 --> 01:34:17.171]  Making them illegal puts massive money into it, it corrupts society, it corrupts the police, just like alcohol prohibition and Kevin Booth's fine film,
[01:34:19.453 --> 01:34:21.215]  American Drug War.
[01:34:21.215 --> 01:34:24.118]  It's aired on Showtime, but the DVD has three hours of extra.
[01:34:24.118 --> 01:34:27.180]  It's really a whole separate film, so it's five hours on there.
[01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:29.762]  That's available right now at Infowars.com.
[01:34:29.762 --> 01:34:31.384]  I hope people will get American Drug War.
[01:34:31.384 --> 01:34:36.188]  We also paired it up with Barry Cooper's Don't Get Busted, Part 1 and 2.
[01:34:36.188 --> 01:34:40.532]  Another police officer exposing all the corruption in those films.
[01:34:40.532 --> 01:34:45.696]  You know, I want to go back and briefly talk to each of you, but Kevin, in summation, the main reason you're on today
[01:34:46.801 --> 01:34:52.366]  Is to try to put attention to the fact that he needs to be let out of prison and is supposed to be released.
[01:34:52.366 --> 01:35:01.213]  And I think it's important then that we also explain for him to get out that he's just trying to create an anti-drug movement and employ people through a media system to do this.
[01:35:01.213 --> 01:35:08.859]  So I think that makes it a lot safer for him to be released from prison and that the establishment won't be going after him.
[01:35:08.859 --> 01:35:13.203]  I just know that he in the past has exposed government drug dealing to hypocrisy.
[01:35:13.903 --> 01:35:16.584]  And expose Gary Webb's a clear murder and a lot of other issues.
[01:35:16.584 --> 01:35:20.266]  So we do appreciate Ricky Ross's courage.
[01:35:20.266 --> 01:35:21.987]  Kevin Booth.
[01:35:21.987 --> 01:35:23.108]  No, absolutely.
[01:35:23.108 --> 01:35:30.451]  And I think and I look forward to the day when he can sit in your studio in person and hopefully that won't be too long from now.
[01:35:30.451 --> 01:35:37.715]  And I think you'll learn just that he wasn't just some average dumb guy that got used as a scapegoat.
[01:35:37.715 --> 01:35:42.437]  He was a he was and he still is even more so today a brilliant
[01:35:43.075 --> 01:35:58.260]  Very brilliant person with incredible magnetism and I think he's going to be like a big positive person for social change and I think he's going to be able to help a lot of people.
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:03.722]  He's going to be kind of like a black Donald Trump, if you will, but that's going to give back to society.
[01:36:05.110 --> 01:36:09.494]  And show that he can do all these things even under the tyranny that we're living under and give it back.
[01:36:09.494 --> 01:36:18.103]  Well, Kevin, have you got the idea that I was saying, I don't know, I mean I didn't say he wasn't smart, or I guess you mean for others that... No, no, I didn't mean that, yeah.
[01:36:18.103 --> 01:36:25.491]  Sure, no, I know, that's why the CIA worked with him was because he did run it like a professional, like an executive as a business.
[01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:31.382]  Yeah, he just has this magical way of networking like nobody I've ever seen before.
[01:36:31.382 --> 01:36:34.383]  He's just incredible.
[01:36:34.383 --> 01:36:35.384]  Incredible character.
[01:36:35.384 --> 01:36:38.745]  Hopefully you'll get to know him pretty soon.
[01:36:38.745 --> 01:36:44.327]  Hopefully this stuff will blow over and he'll be out pretty soon.
[01:36:44.327 --> 01:36:52.831]  Well, specifically from talking to him, and we're going to go back to our other two guests who are working with him, what is he planning to do with these freeway enterprises?
[01:36:53.888 --> 01:36:56.610]  Well, you know, first of all, it's a record label.
[01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:58.431]  They've already got many artists on there.
[01:36:58.431 --> 01:37:05.297]  I saw some of them, a guy by the name of Stability in Chicago, some great hip-hop artists.
[01:37:05.297 --> 01:37:08.419]  So Freeway Enterprises is going to be a record label.
[01:37:08.419 --> 01:37:11.702]  It's going to be a multimedia conglomerate.
[01:37:11.702 --> 01:37:18.407]  They're going to handle everything from street artists to producers to filmmakers to just everybody.
[01:37:18.407 --> 01:37:22.690]  It's just kind of like a big networking thing that Ricky's going to be at the center of.
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:33.206]  And like I said, one of the, um, the things on the reality show is that Ricky is going to show that he can earn a million dollars in one year and then just give that million dollars back to the community.
[01:37:33.206 --> 01:37:37.168]  And that's just going to be kind of like a side note of all the other things that he's doing.
[01:37:37.168 --> 01:37:40.009]  But, uh, and he, and he plans on kind of starting at the bottom.
[01:37:40.009 --> 01:37:44.112]  Ricky, when he gets out, he actually just approved that he can do it.
[01:37:44.112 --> 01:37:49.094]  He wants to like, you know, work at McDonald's or at home Depot, or just take on some little tasks like that.
[01:37:49.094 --> 01:37:51.916]  In other words, he doesn't want any special favors because of who he is.
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:38:10.824]  And he wants to show that, you know, this guy can get out of prison, can rebuild himself, even under, like, the horrible conditions that we're all living under right now with the economy, and that, you know, he just is hoping to be a, you know, a beacon of light for a lot of, like, hopeless people.
[01:38:10.824 --> 01:38:12.105]  Continue.
[01:38:12.105 --> 01:38:17.906]  Well, you know, uh, I just think the reality show's gonna be, it's gonna be incredible.
[01:38:17.906 --> 01:38:22.087]  I mean, he's got, he's got a big family, friends, he's got networks in a lot of cities,
[01:38:22.754 --> 01:38:29.780]  Right now, I kind of look at what we're doing as kind of like a casting, kind of pilot, creating situation.
[01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:31.221]  We're going around and we're just filming.
[01:38:31.221 --> 01:38:32.162]  We filmed this hearing.
[01:38:32.162 --> 01:38:33.163]  We went to Chicago.
[01:38:33.163 --> 01:38:34.864]  I filmed for several days in Chicago.
[01:38:34.864 --> 01:38:38.908]  And just all these incredible characters.
[01:38:38.908 --> 01:38:42.771]  It's going to be a really interesting reality show.
[01:38:42.771 --> 01:38:46.234]  We're not exactly where it's going to land as of now.
[01:38:46.234 --> 01:38:47.475]  It might be BET.
[01:38:47.475 --> 01:38:48.376]  It might be MTV.
[01:38:48.376 --> 01:38:49.697]  We're not sure where it's going to land.
[01:38:50.649 --> 01:38:53.890]  Currently, you know, in meetings with that.
[01:38:53.890 --> 01:38:57.771]  And that's about it, man.
[01:38:57.771 --> 01:39:00.592]  You know, the first thing we're going to do is going to be like the cannonball run.
[01:39:00.592 --> 01:39:06.253]  When he does get out of prison, he's going to only have so many hours to get to the halfway house.
[01:39:06.253 --> 01:39:10.174]  And then we're going to be like 24 hours to drive across the United States.
[01:39:10.174 --> 01:39:13.915]  So it's going to be like a funny Dom Deluise movie or something.
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:17.901]  Oh, so we can play eastbound and down, then?
[01:39:17.901 --> 01:39:19.481]  Yeah.
[01:39:19.481 --> 01:39:23.482]  Old Smokey's got his ears on, he's out on your tail.
[01:39:23.482 --> 01:39:27.943]  And he ain't going to rest until you're in jail, so you've got to dodge him, you've got to duck him.
[01:39:27.943 --> 01:39:30.784]  You've got to keep that diesel trucking.
[01:39:30.784 --> 01:39:32.824]  Alright, well that's interesting.
[01:39:32.824 --> 01:39:34.925]  Can't wait to see that unfold.
[01:39:34.925 --> 01:39:42.687]  And there's one other guy, I don't know if he's standing by, named Hakeem, also goes by the name Royce, he was part of
[01:39:43.137 --> 01:39:54.641]  Special Operations, and I know he might be standing there next to straw, but he was actually in Panama during the whole Noriega incident, and he actually knows some cool things about all this.
[01:39:54.641 --> 01:39:55.982]  I don't know if he wants to get on the phone.
[01:39:55.982 --> 01:39:58.523]  Sure, let's bring Hakeem up.
[01:39:58.523 --> 01:40:02.905]  Sir, how are you quoting Special Operations specifically?
[01:40:02.905 --> 01:40:03.285]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:03.285 --> 01:40:09.487]  I was an intelligence analyst for the military and attached to the Department of Defense in Panama from 1985 to 1989.
[01:40:13.959 --> 01:40:16.001]  Tell us about that.
[01:40:16.001 --> 01:40:23.067]  Well, when I first got them a Spanish-linguist, so I was attached to a special forces unit down there.
[01:40:23.067 --> 01:40:26.971]  And during the first three years of my assignment there, the U.S.
[01:40:26.971 --> 01:40:35.619]  was involved with the Contra operation in Honduras, and we were assisting the Contras to overthrow the Sandinista government.
[01:40:36.323 --> 01:40:47.625]  And in my capacity as an analyst there, I've witnessed a lot of activities and things that ended up being, well, five or six years later, I realized the scope and the extent of it.
[01:40:47.625 --> 01:40:52.446]  But a lot of us were only aware of the Iran-Contra affairs as far as the U.S.
[01:40:52.446 --> 01:41:02.169]  buying weapons or selling weapons to Iran and using the money to support the Contras after Congress cut out our funding when they found out the operations we were running.
[01:41:02.169 --> 01:41:02.989]  Well, now we're talking!
[01:41:04.409 --> 01:41:30.296]  Now we're talking because, let me specifically tell us a little bit about yourself, how you know Frio Ricky Ross, but this is important because we've had Celica Stillo, who's been on Nightline and you name it, the head DEA agent down there at the time with the DEA, and he witnessed them shipping cocaine out for California, for the United States, out of El Pongo, but of course you were compartmentalized at the time, what did you see?
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:42.010]  I actually assisted and went on drug and addiction raids throughout Central and South America, and I witnessed from my capacity the stockpiling of cocaine.
[01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:56.444]  At the time, I had no idea, but the need-to-know basis, I didn't know where the ultimate destination was, but I was aware that we were raiding processing plants in South America, bringing the cocaine into Panama, after destroying as much as we could at the processing plants.
[01:41:56.884 --> 01:41:57.365]  We're good.
[01:42:15.242 --> 01:42:24.307]  Being involved with it at the level that I got involved with it, I started, along with others, to start sending stuff ourselves to the United States.
[01:42:24.307 --> 01:42:29.209]  Hence, I ended up in federal prison for 13 and a half years because of my involvement.
[01:42:29.970 --> 01:42:41.085]  And prior to that, you know, we signed non-disclosure agreements, agreeing not to discuss some of the things that we did, and some of them hadn't been classified until after this Iran-Contra scandal had surfaced.
[01:42:41.085 --> 01:42:47.033]  But once that came to light, then, you know, the light bulb came on, like, okay, so this is what we were doing.
[01:42:47.606 --> 01:42:51.347]  And it kind of, it put a bad taste in my mouth about our government and the administration.
[01:42:51.347 --> 01:42:57.068]  And not just that administration, it's who knows how long these type of activities have been going on.
[01:42:57.068 --> 01:43:01.389]  You know, that may have been the premise for the whole Vietnam War, so no one knew.
[01:43:01.389 --> 01:43:07.551]  Well, it's admitted they were bringing in the heroin inside the confines.
[01:43:07.551 --> 01:43:07.931]  Sure.
[01:43:07.931 --> 01:43:11.652]  But after a while, you know, it gets to a point where
[01:43:12.648 --> 01:43:14.271]  They have to clean house.
[01:43:14.271 --> 01:43:22.866]  So when they did the indictment of Noriega, we, you know, that was much publicized worldwide, but it wasn't publicized that there were almost 60 Americans.
[01:43:23.635 --> 01:43:30.240]  You know, with different levels of rank in the military, the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, who were involved with drug trafficking at the time.
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:33.682]  And the first thing that our government always does is discredit you.
[01:43:33.682 --> 01:43:37.225]  Because they control the media, they can tell us basically what to think.
[01:43:37.225 --> 01:43:43.449]  You know, what the American people thought, you know, we're criminals, we're the worst, we're the scourge of society.
[01:43:43.449 --> 01:43:47.692]  But all along, it's our government that sponsors all of these activities, and we were just tools.
[01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:52.062]  And then after a while, you know, they give you a 20-year sentence that you are a smuggler.
[01:43:52.062 --> 01:43:53.883]  You were privy to classified information.
[01:43:53.883 --> 01:44:01.728]  You used that information to smuggle drugs into the country and they made all of us, they vilified all of us as if we were the wrongdoers.
[01:44:01.728 --> 01:44:03.809]  But we were doing what we were ordered to do.
[01:44:04.249 --> 01:44:05.850]  Well, let me stop you right there.
[01:44:05.850 --> 01:44:21.596]  Back in 1998, I confronted General Barry McCaffrey, then head drug czar, Kevin Putt in his American Drug War film, and I read to him the Reuters article out that week where the head of the Army's complete drug interdiction for Latin America was caught with his wife
[01:44:22.927 --> 01:44:25.609]  Shipping in heroin and cocaine to New York.
[01:44:25.609 --> 01:44:28.970]  And from research, that's pretty much standard, isn't it?
[01:44:28.970 --> 01:44:30.031]  It's kind of the wink-wink.
[01:44:30.031 --> 01:44:35.014]  The government has its big shipments, but you get to have your own little shipments as a payoff.
[01:44:35.014 --> 01:44:40.117]  But then they burn people to make it look like the drug smuggling is being done by rogue agents.
[01:44:40.964 --> 01:44:41.745]  Exactly.
[01:44:41.745 --> 01:44:52.056]  But then you look at, you know, this thing got so big so fast and exposed so quickly that when they cleaned house, they started with Casey, the director of the CIA.
[01:44:52.056 --> 01:45:00.426]  You know, just coincidentally, he has an aneurysm right before he goes to testify to the Senate subcommittee after everyone pointed the finger at him.
[01:45:01.022 --> 01:45:11.045]  And Gary Webb exposed Rick Ross's connection to the CIA Iran concert program, and he's dead.
[01:45:11.045 --> 01:45:13.566]  And, you know, it's just, it's dangerous.
[01:45:13.566 --> 01:45:16.967]  Yeah, that's the point I was trying to make to Kevin and everybody else.
[01:45:16.967 --> 01:45:18.608]  This is dangerous.
[01:45:18.608 --> 01:45:20.168]  Hakeem, we may do a story on this.
[01:45:20.168 --> 01:45:23.009]  What's your full name?
[01:45:23.009 --> 01:45:25.650]  At this moment... That's okay if you don't want to tell it, that's fine.
[01:45:25.650 --> 01:45:30.132]  But, I mean, just in my experience, once you've let the cat halfway out of the bag,
[01:45:31.104 --> 01:45:32.805]  You might as well let all the way out, right?
[01:45:32.805 --> 01:45:34.746]  Yeah, it's dangerous to be halfway out of the bag.
[01:45:34.746 --> 01:45:36.507]  I mean, I assure you they know who you are.
[01:45:36.507 --> 01:45:39.189]  How did you get to know Ricky Ross?
[01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:54.319]  Actually, when I first got back to the United States in 1989, prior to my being deported from Panama, I spoke with some individuals who knew a couple of the individuals who were actually receiving the drugs that were staged in Panama.
[01:45:55.095 --> 01:46:00.397]  And his name surfaced then, so when I got back here, I was aware of who he is, but I didn't know.
[01:46:00.397 --> 01:46:04.739]  I actually went to federal prison the same year he did, 1994.
[01:46:04.739 --> 01:46:09.021]  And, um, so I had an idea who he was, but it hadn't surfaced.
[01:46:09.021 --> 01:46:11.582]  Gary Webb's story hadn't surfaced yet.
[01:46:11.582 --> 01:46:20.566]  So I pretty much kept that stuff under my vest until... Well, look at how they killed... Okay, it's out there now, so I might as well say what little I can about it.
[01:46:20.566 --> 01:46:20.766]  Sure.
[01:46:20.766 --> 01:46:22.247]  Well, look at how they killed, um...
[01:46:23.334 --> 01:46:25.136]  Barry Seal and he had George Bush Sr.'
[01:46:25.096 --> 01:46:26.738]  's number in his top pocket.
[01:46:40.385 --> 01:46:44.229]  It's just, you know, after a while you look at it and it kind of gives you a bad taste in your mouth.
[01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:48.192]  So what we're trying to do now, we're focusing on, okay, we did what we did.
[01:46:48.192 --> 01:46:49.133]  It's out there.
[01:46:49.133 --> 01:46:50.174]  People know.
[01:46:50.174 --> 01:46:52.176]  They're going to believe it or not believe it.
[01:46:52.176 --> 01:47:02.886]  So what we can do now is try to prevent any other young African Americans or minorities or anyone who is considering getting involved with the drug trade or any illegal illicit activity
[01:47:03.626 --> 01:47:05.487]  Give him an opportunity to do something different.
[01:47:18.021 --> 01:47:19.502]  You know, it's kind of strange.
[01:47:19.502 --> 01:47:21.184]  You know, I've been in federal prison.
[01:47:21.184 --> 01:47:22.385]  I looked at the situation.
[01:47:22.385 --> 01:47:28.850]  There's no reason that the judge should not have released him at the time that he should be released.
[01:47:28.850 --> 01:47:35.496]  Now, he can always say, well, the halfway house didn't have a bed available or whatever, but anything other than that is personal.
[01:47:35.496 --> 01:47:36.977]  It has nothing to do with professional.
[01:47:39.019 --> 01:47:46.525]  Hakeem, in closing, I'd like to have you back up for a longer interview once I can vet what you're talking about, who you are.
[01:47:46.525 --> 01:47:48.306]  I mean, I believe you.
[01:47:48.306 --> 01:47:51.529]  Kevin's working with you and so is Mr. Ross.
[01:47:51.529 --> 01:47:53.330]  But this is the point I was bringing up to Kevin earlier.
[01:47:53.330 --> 01:47:54.771]  I know Kevin knows this.
[01:47:54.771 --> 01:47:57.093]  This is the type of stuff that gets you killed.
[01:47:57.093 --> 01:48:01.197]  So I do think it's important that you're on record saying that you're just going to try to expose
[01:48:02.077 --> 01:48:02.317]  I don't know.
[01:48:24.371 --> 01:48:38.581]  We need to get Mr. Ross out of prison because he is in danger while he's in there and the fact that they're holding him like this and holding it up is very very suspicious and so we just appreciate your courage on coming on the show as well, but the drug culture
[01:48:39.924 --> 01:48:40.885]  is a trap.
[01:48:40.885 --> 01:48:43.848]  They want to get people into their prison system.
[01:48:43.848 --> 01:48:52.216]  If you go look at the graph from 1980 to now, how the prison population went up seven-fold to the biggest in the world, you understand this is a trap.
[01:48:52.216 --> 01:48:53.718]  They bring in drugs.
[01:48:53.718 --> 01:48:54.598]  They make it illegal.
[01:48:54.598 --> 01:48:57.021]  They make it hugely profitable because it's illegal.
[01:48:57.021 --> 01:48:58.903]  They know the young people start using it.
[01:48:58.903 --> 01:49:01.625]  It is a way to reinstitute slavery
[01:49:02.626 --> 01:49:04.227]  In the United States.
[01:49:04.227 --> 01:49:06.188]  And so, I commend what you're doing.
[01:49:06.188 --> 01:49:12.371]  And the young people will listen to people that come from the rock and roll drug culture as the media advertises it.
[01:49:12.371 --> 01:49:14.452]  So, I think this is going to be very, very successful.
[01:49:14.452 --> 01:49:15.513]  And I appreciate you coming on.
[01:49:15.513 --> 01:49:17.414]  So, thank you, Hakeem.
[01:49:17.414 --> 01:49:23.177]  I wanted to get some closing comments because we're about to break and I've got to come back with other news from Monique Hall.
[01:49:23.177 --> 01:49:25.938]  Monique, you've got final comments here.
[01:49:25.938 --> 01:49:26.298]  Sure.
[01:49:26.298 --> 01:49:29.980]  I just want to make sure that everyone is aware that Ricky has actually changed his life over.
[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:31.581]  His past is his past.
[01:49:31.937 --> 01:49:35.523]  I want to make sure you guys go to the site Freeway Enterprise and see some of the new things.
[01:49:35.523 --> 01:49:37.507]  It's FreewayEnterprise.com.
[01:49:37.507 --> 01:49:40.072]  See some of the new things that he has going on.
[01:49:40.072 --> 01:49:40.973]  I'm a praying woman.
[01:49:40.973 --> 01:49:43.478]  I honestly believe that God has Ricky in his hands.
[01:49:43.877 --> 01:49:46.938]  And I believe that all the projects that he touches will be, you know, blessed.
[01:49:46.938 --> 01:49:49.998]  So at this point, I want to thank you for having us on.
[01:49:49.998 --> 01:49:52.779]  Let your listeners know to keep Ricky in your prayers.
[01:49:52.779 --> 01:49:58.160]  And I hope that he does the right thing and, you know, pursues some great things instead of looking back at the past.
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:49:58.800]  Absolutely.
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:49:59.700]  Thank you so much.
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:03.941]  And as soon as he gets out or they don't let him out, Chapter 2, we'll cover this again.
[01:50:03.941 --> 01:50:07.662]  And Kevin, thanks for contacting me with this story.
[01:50:07.662 --> 01:50:09.502]  Just watch your back and say your prayers.
[01:50:10.322 --> 01:50:11.883]  Cross your fingers.
[01:50:11.883 --> 01:50:12.864]  I'm real proud of it.
[01:50:12.864 --> 01:50:14.645]  I watched the video of your new studio.
[01:50:14.645 --> 01:50:16.566]  Your new 7,000 square foot studio.
[01:50:16.566 --> 01:50:17.246]  I'm proud of you.
[01:50:17.246 --> 01:50:18.467]  It looks great.
[01:50:18.467 --> 01:50:19.307]  Oh, well, thank you, Kevin.
[01:50:19.307 --> 01:50:23.630]  I mean, it's not that high tech, but it's better than the 2,500 square feet we had before.
[01:50:23.630 --> 01:50:25.991]  We were stacked on each other in there.
[01:50:25.991 --> 01:50:26.892]  Yeah, no, man.
[01:50:26.892 --> 01:50:27.833]  You're expanding.
[01:50:27.833 --> 01:50:28.333]  It's awesome.
[01:50:28.333 --> 01:50:29.474]  I'm proud of you, dude.
[01:50:29.474 --> 01:50:32.255]  Well, I mean, we're trying to expand here.
[01:50:32.255 --> 01:50:33.596]  It's rough.
[01:50:33.596 --> 01:50:34.617]  Kevin, good talking to you.
[01:50:34.617 --> 01:50:35.998]  Thanks for the story.
[01:50:35.998 --> 01:50:36.678]  We'll see you soon.
[01:50:36.678 --> 01:50:37.919]  Say hi to Trey for me.
[01:50:37.919 --> 01:50:38.079]  Okay.
[01:50:38.692 --> 01:50:39.393]  All right, take care.
[01:50:39.393 --> 01:50:39.993]  There they go.
[01:50:39.993 --> 01:50:42.415]  I want to thank Hakeem for coming on.
[01:50:42.415 --> 01:50:43.415]  I want to thank Straw.
[01:50:43.415 --> 01:50:45.097]  I want to thank Monique Hall.
[01:50:45.097 --> 01:50:48.479]  I want to thank Kevin Booth for coming on with that story, and we'll watch this as it develops.
[01:50:48.479 --> 01:50:58.246]  Okay, I got Alan Watt coming up, but I also need to get into the military tracking and following his story, specifically going after the in the Fed people.
[01:50:58.246 --> 01:50:58.926]  This is big.
[01:50:58.926 --> 01:50:59.387]  Stay with us.
[01:51:02.185 --> 01:51:06.250]  Do you have trouble sleeping due to sensations in your legs?
[01:51:06.250 --> 01:51:08.153]  You are not alone.
[01:51:08.153 --> 01:51:11.017]  Millions of Americans suffer from restless legs.
[01:51:11.017 --> 01:51:16.083]  Restless legs is a condition caused by the uncontrollable urge to move your legs.
[01:51:16.083 --> 01:51:17.826]  Signs include itching, pulling,
[01:51:18.266 --> 01:51:18.767]  Let's do it!

[01:52:00.616 --> 01:52:07.519]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:14.165]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:14.165 --> 01:52:20.669]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:20.669 --> 01:52:22.631]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:22.631 --> 01:52:25.093]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:25.093 --> 01:52:35.921]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:38.271 --> 01:52:39.953]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.953 --> 01:52:41.814]  It's about a one world government.
[01:52:41.814 --> 01:52:48.721]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:52:56.988 --> 01:52:58.570]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:58.570 --> 01:52:59.751]  The people strike back.
[01:53:02.208 --> 01:53:08.392]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[01:53:08.392 --> 01:53:14.816]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[01:53:14.816 --> 01:53:20.539]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[01:53:20.539 --> 01:53:22.640]  Starve or surrender.
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:27.323]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[01:53:27.323 --> 01:53:28.203]  What then?
[01:53:30.919 --> 01:53:34.002]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[01:53:34.002 --> 01:53:38.325]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[01:53:38.325 --> 01:53:41.207]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.
[01:53:41.207 --> 01:53:48.433]  You can now have an infinite amount of healthy vegetables like a watermelon, a bundle of carrots, or tomatoes for a little more than a penny each.
[01:53:48.433 --> 01:53:50.315]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:53:50.315 --> 01:53:55.739]  And now you can go into business with Big John at SurvivalistSeeds.com by becoming an affiliate.
[01:53:55.739 --> 01:53:58.461]  See his link at SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:53:58.461 --> 01:53:59.262]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:54:04.093 --> 01:54:06.535]  Yeah, we're sending out an S.O.S.
[01:54:06.535 --> 01:54:07.615]  message in a bottle.
[01:54:07.615 --> 01:54:09.156]  Little red pills.
[01:54:09.156 --> 01:54:11.738]  Raining them down on the population.
[01:54:11.738 --> 01:54:15.560]  The public is primed and ready to wake up.
[01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:22.725]  A couple of program notes, then we've got a breakdown of the Army Dispatch in response to End the Fed protest.
[01:54:22.725 --> 01:54:25.567]  Alan Watts joining us for about an hour and a half after that.
[01:54:25.567 --> 01:54:26.307]  Come up in about 10-15 minutes.
[01:54:29.791 --> 01:54:34.935]  I wanted to thank our sponsors here that are making the show possible.
[01:54:34.935 --> 01:54:37.417]  We have a fabulous new sponsor.
[01:54:37.417 --> 01:54:40.879]  I went out and found the very best prices, the very best products.
[01:54:40.879 --> 01:54:43.661]  It's Pepperspray.com.
[01:54:43.661 --> 01:54:47.104]  We live in an unpredictable world, and as everyone knows, I'm all about preparedness.
[01:54:47.104 --> 01:54:50.166]  Remember, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
[01:54:50.166 --> 01:54:51.307]  That's why I want you to visit
[01:54:51.687 --> 01:54:53.608]  Our new sponsor, Pepperspray.com.
[01:54:53.608 --> 01:55:01.392]  One word, Pepperspray.com, but check out their wide variety of personal security products they have available on their website at incredible discounts.
[01:55:01.392 --> 01:55:07.215]  I mean, this stuff is so cheap and inexpensive and the highest quality, I was asking them, how do you even pay for advertising if it's this low?
[01:55:07.215 --> 01:55:09.256]  And they said, well, we sell a lot of this stuff.
[01:55:09.256 --> 01:55:15.079]  Since 1994, Pepperspray.com has made your personal safety their number one priority, so give them a call at 800-
[01:55:17.561 --> 01:55:17.961]  908-9988.
[01:55:17.961 --> 01:55:25.687]  And again, that number is 800-908-9988 or visit them at pepperspray.com and give yourself some peace of mind.
[01:55:25.687 --> 01:55:28.209]  And folks, they have tasers, stun guns, everything.
[01:55:28.209 --> 01:55:29.210]  People go, what do you mean you're for...
[01:55:30.185 --> 01:55:31.026]  Tasers and stun guns.
[01:55:31.026 --> 01:55:33.328]  Yeah, I'm against police misusing them.
[01:55:33.328 --> 01:55:35.210]  It's great that citizens have them.
[01:55:35.210 --> 01:55:37.533]  If your wife's afraid of a gun, have her with a taser.
[01:55:37.533 --> 01:55:41.597]  Somebody tries to assault her in a parking lot, or your daughter going to college, that's what I really like.
[01:55:41.597 --> 01:55:50.926]  They got great prices on tasers, the whole nine yards, animal repellents, home safety, personal alarms, free shipping on all orders over 99 bucks.
[01:55:51.792 --> 01:55:52.292]  Pepper Spray.
[01:56:23.835 --> 01:56:24.896]  Now, here's a program note.
[01:56:24.896 --> 01:56:28.501]  I know Kurt Nemo in New Mexico is listening right now.
[01:56:28.501 --> 01:56:31.224]  This is what I want on InfoWars and Prison Planet today, please.
[01:56:31.224 --> 01:56:34.048]  And I want to commend the great job he's doing.
[01:56:34.048 --> 01:56:38.915]  Incidentally, he's about to post the, it's finally out, the full letter, the Ron Paul
[01:56:40.270 --> 01:56:48.697]  Chuck Baldwin slash Bob Bart letter to Missouri Governor, Governor Nixon about the MIAC report and how outraged they are.
[01:56:48.697 --> 01:56:51.720]  Their response is going up on Infowars.com in minutes.
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:57:03.710]  And after that, Kurt is going to write an article basically asking you, the listeners, to promote the best free encode we found on the web of my new film, The Obama Deception.
[01:57:03.710 --> 01:57:05.672]  It's the number one video out there on the web, hands down.
[01:57:07.535 --> 01:57:07.775]  I think?
[01:57:23.863 --> 01:57:35.470]  would make it the number one video and it's been the number one video and it's been the quote hottest video and then they erased change the channel's honors that show he had that and just took it off to knock it off the front page.
[01:57:35.470 --> 01:57:36.191]  Why?
[01:57:36.191 --> 01:57:37.972]  That's where people go for their surfing.
[01:57:37.972 --> 01:57:46.177]  Most people go to YouTube click on the most viewed or the hottest video so it's like being you know on the cover of TV Guide it's it's it people tune into it.
[01:57:48.382 --> 01:57:49.304]  So caught red-handed.
[01:57:49.304 --> 01:57:50.226]  They've done that many times.
[01:57:50.226 --> 01:57:54.553]  We've gotten letters from Google and MySpace admitting they do similar things in the past.
[01:57:54.553 --> 01:57:56.637]  They've done a lot of things like this to us.
[01:57:56.637 --> 01:57:58.300]  So I want a number one headline.
[01:57:58.300 --> 01:57:59.523]  It's being censored.
[01:57:59.523 --> 01:58:00.284]  They're scared of it.
[01:58:01.229 --> 01:58:02.910]  Number two, a call to action.
[01:58:02.910 --> 01:58:04.891]  Please email this to everybody you know.
[01:58:04.891 --> 01:58:06.112]  Post it on all your sites.
[01:58:06.112 --> 01:58:12.336]  Here is the best internet copy, because we don't want the cruddy ones beating it out, because it's hard to watch.
[01:58:12.336 --> 01:58:14.497]  These copies are so bad.
[01:58:14.497 --> 01:58:15.418]  I'm giving it out free.
[01:58:15.418 --> 01:58:17.259]  Here's the best free copy we found.
[01:58:17.259 --> 01:58:18.720]  So we'll make that the number one video.
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:20.080]  It's close to being that.
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:22.122]  Just got to beat out some that have a few hundred thousand views more.
[01:58:23.596 --> 01:58:31.522]  And also then the call to action to buy the DVD to make the really high quality copies at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:31.522 --> 01:58:36.306]  And we're creating an activism page with banners and sheets that people can print out, flyers to promote it.
[01:58:36.306 --> 01:58:42.851]  So I'm asking you to help us get this out to everybody.
[01:58:42.851 --> 01:58:46.374]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.374 --> 01:58:48.255]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:52.921]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.921 --> 01:58:57.664]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.664 --> 01:59:00.625]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.625 --> 01:59:03.667]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.667 --> 01:59:07.289]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[01:59:07.469 --> 01:59:12.992]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:12.992 --> 01:59:19.995]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:19.995 --> 01:59:23.077]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:59:23.257 --> 01:59:23.697]  We're good to go.
[01:59:54.031 --> 01:59:56.433]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.433 --> 02:00:05.781]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.781 --> 02:00:07.082]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.082 --> 02:00:08.864]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.864 --> 02:00:10.625]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.625 --> 02:00:12.186]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.186 --> 02:00:13.748]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.748 --> 02:00:17.931]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.931 --> 02:00:22.015]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.964 --> 02:00:27.025]  Alan Watts needs no introduction.
[02:00:27.025 --> 02:00:33.430]  He'll be with us for an hour and 45 minutes, coming up in T-minus 14 minutes from now.
[02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:39.655]  We're going to talk for 45 minutes and open the phones up in the final hour, now two hours away.
[02:00:39.655 --> 02:00:46.281]  Well, the final hour starts in about 59 minutes to be technical, but that is coming up.
[02:00:49.645 --> 02:00:58.691]  I want to go ahead and start getting into the latest developments with the military tracking and tracing us.
[02:00:58.691 --> 02:01:11.639]  And I'm going to do that as briefly but in as succinct a fashion as I possibly can when we start the next segment and we'll get Alan Watts' take on that.
[02:01:11.639 --> 02:01:13.020]  We're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:01:23.243 --> 02:01:30.769]  So we'll go live at PrisonPlanet.tv when we start the next segment in about six minutes.
[02:01:30.769 --> 02:01:50.604]  United States Army Reserve Force Protection Advisory 09 and this is from November 17, 2008, four days before national protest against the Federal Reserve.
[02:01:50.604 --> 02:01:51.585]  So I thought we'd go over
[02:01:52.878 --> 02:01:57.821]  this document when we get back and start the next segment.
[02:01:57.821 --> 02:02:02.483]  And that dovetails with articles like the one I'm looking at on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:02:02.483 --> 02:02:19.492]  The UK government trains thousands of civilian terror spies and already all over England, it's happened to me, it's happened to Steve Watson in London, they'll just walk up to you when you're getting on a bus or walking down the street with your girlfriend, in his case, and say, line up against the wall, let me see your papers, I'm putting you in a terror database.
[02:02:19.492 --> 02:02:20.913]  It's mainstream news they do this.
[02:02:20.913 --> 02:02:22.234]  And the same thing is being set up here
[02:02:23.706 --> 02:02:43.975]  Obama has announced he's setting up just an amazing new development of 13 million little tattletale squads to run around on the streets, pushing the Federal Reserve takeover of our society.
[02:02:43.975 --> 02:02:45.336]  In fact, let me just cover this now.
[02:02:45.336 --> 02:02:47.217]  We're going to get back into it with Alan Watt.
[02:02:48.697 --> 02:02:49.718]  Kurt Demme wrote a story about it.
[02:02:49.718 --> 02:02:52.081]  It's out of the San Francisco Chronicle.
[02:02:52.081 --> 02:02:55.505]  It says Obama supporters to be unleashed to sell banker plan.
[02:02:55.505 --> 02:02:58.769]  Over the weekend, Obama zombie canvassers may knock on your door.
[02:02:58.769 --> 02:03:08.159]  The Pledge Protect canvas is an unprecedented effort by a president to reach Congress and tap grassroots supporters for their help.
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:13.504]  And if these people go to, like, 27 doors, that would be everybody in the country, basically.
[02:03:13.504 --> 02:03:16.025]  Every person in the country would be visited by him.
[02:03:16.025 --> 02:03:18.247]  Think of the power that gives him.
[02:03:18.247 --> 02:03:29.616]  Volunteers recruited online by Obama's Organization for America, a post-election group, will ask citizens to sign a pledge in support of the President's policies on energy, health care, and education, reports the San Francisco Chronicle.
[02:03:30.296 --> 02:03:35.117]  Obama wants you to sign away your life with the bankers on the dotted line from the Chronicle article.
[02:03:35.117 --> 02:03:42.279]  This is just the beginning for us, said Jeremy Byrd, Deputy National Director of Organizing for America, in an online video to Obama supporters last week.
[02:03:42.279 --> 02:03:46.980]  The establishment in Washington won't welcome this new direction easily.
[02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:51.501]  We can't let this plan be debated solely behind closed doors in Washington, D.C.
[02:03:52.694 --> 02:04:08.485]  The canvases on Saturday, the pledge drive and the calls to Congress are all designed to put our elected officials on Washington on notice that the American people expect the change President Obama campaigned for becomes reality and Organizing America press release explains.
[02:04:08.485 --> 02:04:09.906]  I mean, think of this.
[02:04:09.906 --> 02:04:14.269]  They're saying Obama is anti-establishment and fighting special interests.
[02:04:14.269 --> 02:04:20.553]  Remember a few weeks ago when he said, I know special interests are going to be against what I'm doing and are going to fight, will be put on notice.
[02:04:20.553 --> 02:04:21.494]  I'm going to be fighting.
[02:04:22.941 --> 02:04:25.403]  I'm going to fight as well.
[02:04:25.403 --> 02:04:28.766]  As if he's fighting the establishment and now he's got all these goons.
[02:04:30.233 --> 02:04:40.198]  Who we told you, well-meaning people, but they're goons nonetheless, who believe that, oh, we'd have free jobs and free health care and new houses and all their problems will be solved.
[02:04:40.198 --> 02:04:43.000]  This is what they say, if we just do whatever Obama says.
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:51.344]  So see, when you don't do what he says, that's why the economy's getting bad, not because the bankers that own him and run him are imploding the economy by design.
[02:04:51.344 --> 02:04:52.345]  So that's coming up as well.
[02:04:52.345 --> 02:04:54.006]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:05:01.730 --> 02:05:04.811]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:05:04.811 --> 02:05:10.333]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:05:10.333 --> 02:05:16.055]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:05:16.055 --> 02:05:17.535]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:17.535 --> 02:05:26.538]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:05:26.858 --> 02:05:28.699]  Now compare a Calbin Pure Soap.
[02:05:28.699 --> 02:05:32.900]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[02:05:32.900 --> 02:05:37.921]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[02:05:37.921 --> 02:05:41.762]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[02:05:41.762 --> 02:05:42.842]  Keep it natural.
[02:05:42.842 --> 02:05:51.245]  Call Calbin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[02:05:51.245 --> 02:05:55.426]  Try Calbin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[02:05:55.806 --> 02:06:02.319]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[02:06:02.319 --> 02:06:07.570]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:08.334 --> 02:06:14.215]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:06:14.215 --> 02:06:20.717]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:06:20.717 --> 02:06:22.677]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:06:22.677 --> 02:06:25.138]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:06:25.138 --> 02:06:35.880]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:06:38.337 --> 02:06:39.998]  It's not about left or right.
[02:06:39.998 --> 02:06:41.858]  It's about a one world government.
[02:06:41.858 --> 02:06:48.761]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:06:48.761 --> 02:06:57.024]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:57.024 --> 02:06:58.604]  The Obama Deception.
[02:06:58.604 --> 02:06:59.785]  The people strike back.
[02:07:01.721 --> 02:07:12.292]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?

[02:07:54.939 --> 02:07:55.900]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:19.304 --> 02:08:19.565]  Yeah.
[02:08:30.865 --> 02:08:32.306]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:32.306 --> 02:08:35.649]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:08:35.649 --> 02:08:37.551]  It, of course, is the 23rd day.
[02:08:37.551 --> 02:08:39.252]  It's a Monday of March 2009.
[02:08:39.252 --> 02:08:49.720]  Alan Watt coming up in about five minutes to cover all the latest news and information and break down the New World Order structure that we are all basically being captured in.
[02:08:50.709 --> 02:08:51.489]  Okay.
[02:08:51.489 --> 02:08:56.892]  We just started simulcasting as well at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:56.892 --> 02:09:00.433]  Let me go ahead and break down in some detail our top story today.
[02:09:00.433 --> 02:09:07.936]  This broke Saturday at Infowars.com and at Liberty Restoration Project, Big Libertarian Group as well.
[02:09:07.936 --> 02:09:08.856]  I have made phone calls.
[02:09:08.856 --> 02:09:11.077]  I've confirmed the validity of this document.
[02:09:11.077 --> 02:09:15.219]  Remember two weeks ago we broke the big national story because state police sent us the document.
[02:09:15.839 --> 02:09:24.001]  The federally designed fusion centers all over the United States where they're federalizing local police, putting regular army in the departments.
[02:09:25.484 --> 02:09:38.970]  They sent out this report demonizing Ron Paul supporters, Bob Barr supporters, Chuck Baldwin supporters, Libertarian Party supporters, Constitutional Party supporters, the Liberty Committee, anybody that believes in North American Union, anybody that believes in a new world order.
[02:09:38.970 --> 02:09:44.853]  People denied that for a few days, even though the phone number of the state police was there, even though we called the state police, we had state reps on about it.
[02:09:44.853 --> 02:09:50.055]  The governor now has told the Associated Press, Governor Nixon of Missouri, that he stands behind it, it is their document.
[02:09:50.715 --> 02:09:53.376]  It lists bumper stickers on your car, you're probably a terrorist.
[02:09:53.376 --> 02:09:57.017]  Other similar things in San Francisco and Austin, Texas that we've shown here on air.
[02:09:57.017 --> 02:10:01.878]  They're public that have gotten mainstream news, say a road almanac in your car, sign of being a terrorist.
[02:10:01.878 --> 02:10:03.318]  Cell phone, you're a terrorist.
[02:10:03.318 --> 02:10:04.538]  Blue jeans, you're a terrorist.
[02:10:04.538 --> 02:10:06.439]  You cannot make this up.
[02:10:06.439 --> 02:10:09.600]  So, they tell the public this is all for imaginary Al-Qaeda.
[02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:10.240]  Al-C-I-A-D-A.
[02:10:10.820 --> 02:10:25.617]  But the whole thing has been built and designed for the American people and now NORTHCOM is announcing 20,000 regular troops to engage the American people, the Army War Colleges, they're getting rid of posse comitatus, that they will use the military against the people like a third world country or a dictatorship under Hitler, Stalin or Mao.
[02:10:26.874 --> 02:10:29.074]  The John Warren Defense Authorization Act.
[02:10:29.074 --> 02:10:32.015]  PDD 51 says the Congress is ceremonial.
[02:10:32.015 --> 02:10:36.336]  The Federal Reserve has come out and said Congress, the President, no one can even ask them questions.
[02:10:36.336 --> 02:10:37.976]  They run everything.
[02:10:37.976 --> 02:10:47.778]  Last night's show, the Sunday show, I played the audio clips of them saying this in Congressional hearings and clips from Laird NewsHour with the former Fed Chairman Greenspan saying it.
[02:10:47.778 --> 02:10:53.219]  This is the criminal shadow government moving to block the American people's opposition to their tyranny.
[02:10:53.579 --> 02:11:12.961]  So they are the criminals, they are the terrorists, they stage the terror attacks, and then they build up this police state apparatus against the foreign brown people, thinking the public would buy into it, the whole time building the mechanism, the apparatus, to go after the general public and keep us from ever taking our government back from one of their criminal takeovers, which we're in the middle of right now.
[02:11:14.122 --> 02:11:15.503]  This is a long time in the planning.
[02:11:15.503 --> 02:11:17.265]  They're now making their move.
[02:11:17.265 --> 02:11:20.328]  They've openly announced in hundreds of publications that we cover here daily.
[02:11:20.328 --> 02:11:23.050]  Last week it was in probably ten publications we showed on air.
[02:11:23.050 --> 02:11:30.837]  London Telegraph, Associated Press, Reuters, a new bank of the world that you will pay your taxes to, carbon taxes, total control.
[02:11:30.837 --> 02:11:33.779]  The banks will set world interest rates, set currency rates.
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:37.381]  You will pay your taxes to a new Bank of the World.
[02:11:37.381 --> 02:11:40.963]  April 2nd, the G20's meeting again to publicly announce this.
[02:11:40.963 --> 02:11:43.925]  They're already announcing it in financial publications.
[02:11:43.925 --> 02:11:48.807]  While the public and the mainstream dominant, you know, TV nightly news says, what's Geithner's plan?
[02:11:48.807 --> 02:11:49.628]  No one will tell us.
[02:11:49.628 --> 02:11:50.608]  What are you going to do?
[02:11:50.608 --> 02:11:51.989]  Please save us, Geithner.
[02:11:51.989 --> 02:11:54.250]  Getting everybody, you know, on the edge of their seat.
[02:11:54.250 --> 02:11:55.451]  Oh, fix things, fix things.
[02:11:55.451 --> 02:11:56.972]  Give us a new Bank of the World.
[02:11:56.972 --> 02:11:58.052]  They'll announce it.
[02:11:58.052 --> 02:12:00.773]  They'll jack the stock market back up and get everybody to go along with it.
[02:12:00.773 --> 02:12:03.495]  They'll say, see Alex, the Bank of the World fixed everything.
[02:12:03.795 --> 02:12:11.858]  Then they'll plunge us back into total control and then expand more power for themselves in the name of fixing the next crisis they create.
[02:12:11.858 --> 02:12:13.318]  So that's where we're going with all of this.
[02:12:13.318 --> 02:12:18.180]  Now, there's some background on the current state of the world and what we're facing.
[02:12:18.180 --> 02:12:20.781]  The Federal Reserve's now secretly, according to Associated Press,
[02:12:22.129 --> 02:12:30.836]  And the New York Times, Emlin and Telegraph has been for months, as we told you, issuing their own secret currency to themselves to buy up real assets.
[02:12:30.836 --> 02:12:33.578]  The IMF World Bank are issuing super currency.
[02:12:33.578 --> 02:12:34.879]  That's mainstream news now.
[02:12:34.879 --> 02:12:37.061]  It's already happening.
[02:12:37.061 --> 02:12:40.544]  Again, they just make money out of nothing and buy up whatever they want and back it up with our tax dollars.
[02:12:40.544 --> 02:12:42.846]  Now, imagine back in November 22nd,
[02:12:45.049 --> 02:13:03.164]  In 38 locations, every private fellow reserve branch management bank that then rules over the rest of the banks and insurance companies now through the FDIC, the real government, we went out and protested the real government saying forget Obama, forget Bush, they're all puppets, that's in my film The Obama Deception.
[02:13:03.164 --> 02:13:08.249]  And it's been admitted that arming intelligence tracks and traces
[02:13:10.811 --> 02:13:21.000]  Mainline peace groups, mainline anti-death penalty groups, mainline, you know, Gandhi non-violent groups and calls them terrorists, mainline bike riding groups that want bike lanes.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:24.704]  It's come out in Connecticut and Vermont and New York and Texas.
[02:13:24.704 --> 02:13:29.488]  Anybody, I mean, they go and sit in mainline churches to hear what's being said.
[02:13:29.488 --> 02:13:33.712]  The state police, the feds, all of them.
[02:13:33.712 --> 02:13:35.653]  So all of that is going on, that's been in the news.
[02:13:36.604 --> 02:13:38.105]  And it's a felony when they do it.
[02:13:38.105 --> 02:13:39.566]  I mean, it's a violation of federal law.
[02:13:39.566 --> 02:13:41.406]  The Army's not supposed to do this.
[02:13:41.406 --> 02:13:45.449]  The only time they can watch people is if they're at a military reservation.
[02:13:45.449 --> 02:13:48.050]  But they can't be outside of the reservation watching people.
[02:13:48.050 --> 02:13:56.254]  They were, in this case, the Liberty Restoration Project, and we made calls to confirm down to Camp Mabry, where it's run out of, and Fort Hood.
[02:13:56.254 --> 02:13:58.015]  This is actually run out of Austin.
[02:13:58.015 --> 02:14:03.638]  This is a report put out in Texas, but it says that there's nationwide nexus points
[02:14:04.582 --> 02:14:06.284]  This is being done everywhere.
[02:14:06.284 --> 02:14:08.227]  Through the threat fusion centers.
[02:14:08.227 --> 02:14:10.130]  Same ones that put out the MIAC report, federally written.
[02:14:11.176 --> 02:14:35.038]  uh... that basically uh... people protesting the fed the liberty committee ron paul could be terrorist and maybe planning violent attacks and it tells the police how to be careful how the fbi to be careful the army's there to support them dealing with us uh... that we may basically decide to attack it tells our officers be very careful these people are deadly dangerous basically uh... and you can read that report
[02:14:36.084 --> 02:14:40.525]  It is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:14:40.525 --> 02:14:41.185]  Here is the report.
[02:14:41.185 --> 02:14:47.627]  You can see the order sheet for covering the Houston and Dallas and San Antonio.
[02:14:47.627 --> 02:14:50.547]  Show folks the final page, please.
[02:14:50.547 --> 02:14:57.849]  On the final page, the third page, you can read the officers' names, the orders, what they're doing.
[02:14:57.849 --> 02:15:01.570]  It goes into military safety, how to work with the local police.
[02:15:03.315 --> 02:15:12.881]  Now, this one is different than the MIAC report because it doesn't start out listing cop killers and saying these people want to kill you.
[02:15:12.881 --> 02:15:19.064]  It starts out sounding reasonable, saying what we stand for and what we believe in.
[02:15:19.064 --> 02:15:21.506]  Again, this is secret police.
[02:15:21.506 --> 02:15:23.787]  This is the military watching the American people.
[02:15:25.678 --> 02:15:45.035]  It says the, and let's go to the first page again, the United States Army Reserve Command, and again this has already been federalized so it's regular Army, is publishing this force protection advisory to advise all Army Reserve personnel of the planned protest at all Federal Reserve banks and office locations in the United States on the 22nd of November 2008.
[02:15:45.035 --> 02:15:51.341]  This message provides situational awareness and recommended mitigation measures.
[02:15:55.316 --> 02:16:05.144]  Activists will demand an end to private banker control of the nation's money supply and return to the hard, commodity-backed monetary system.
[02:16:05.144 --> 02:16:07.626]  The slogan is simple and direct.
[02:16:07.626 --> 02:16:17.513]  In the Fed, the November 22nd protests are intended as a kickoff of an ongoing campaign to educate and organize the public and take concerted, planned action.
[02:16:17.513 --> 02:16:19.435]  Oh, can't have that with the First Amendment in America.
[02:16:21.499 --> 02:16:29.054]  The consensus action of We The People can save the nation from ruin, plunder, and total socialist tyranny.
[02:16:29.054 --> 02:16:29.796]  The time is now.
[02:16:29.796 --> 02:16:31.399]  The following URL provides an
[02:16:33.496 --> 02:16:37.739]  View of the site that provides information on the scheduled protest.
[02:16:37.739 --> 02:16:39.060]  It's a lot clearer on the screen.
[02:16:39.060 --> 02:16:40.901]  I guess the printer here is going out of ink.
[02:16:40.901 --> 02:16:41.482]  It's my copy.
[02:16:41.482 --> 02:16:41.982]  I can barely read it.
[02:16:41.982 --> 02:16:42.262]  You know what?
[02:16:42.262 --> 02:16:43.864]  I'm just going to read it off screen here.
[02:16:43.864 --> 02:16:44.244]  That's better.
[02:16:44.244 --> 02:16:45.865]  I'll look across the room and read it.
[02:16:45.865 --> 02:16:52.510]  The organizers for these planned protests have published the following conduct principles for participation.
[02:16:52.510 --> 02:16:56.693]  All in the Fed organizing groups and participants must agree to the following principles.
[02:16:56.693 --> 02:16:59.155]  Peaceful, non-violent rally to support sound money
[02:17:00.302 --> 02:17:07.428]  Cooperation, respect for local laws and authorities, no harassment of federal employees, no blocking of pedestrian or vehicle traffic.
[02:17:07.428 --> 02:17:09.650]  But then later they get into basically how we're terrorists.
[02:17:09.650 --> 02:17:11.651]  This is so sick how they could just say this.
[02:17:11.651 --> 02:17:12.973]  It's our First Amendment right.
[02:17:12.973 --> 02:17:16.636]  It's a federal violation of law to have the Army spying on us, but they do it.
[02:17:16.636 --> 02:17:20.239]  Go ahead and go back to it so I can read it, thanks.
[02:17:20.239 --> 02:17:24.082]  Known locations and events, protests will be held in the following 38 cities.
[02:17:24.082 --> 02:17:28.706]  Boston, Philadelphia, New York City, Buffalo, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Richmond, Baltimore, Charlotte,
[02:17:29.719 --> 02:17:34.103]  Atlanta, Birmingham, Jacksonville, Miami, Nashville, New Orleans, Chicago, Detroit, St.
[02:17:34.103 --> 02:17:45.314]  Louis, Little Rock, Louisiana, Memphis, Minneapolis, Helena, Kansas City, Denver, Oklahoma City, Omaha, Dallas, El Paso, Houston, San Antonio, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, Salt Lake City, Washington, D.C.
[02:17:45.314 --> 02:17:51.400]  The following URL provides an interactive site that provides information on the locations of fellow reserve branches.
[02:17:52.782 --> 02:17:53.442]  Precautions.
[02:17:53.442 --> 02:17:54.843]  This is number five.
[02:17:54.843 --> 02:17:55.763]  This is out of Texas.
[02:17:55.763 --> 02:17:57.823]  Be aware of your environment at all times.
[02:17:57.823 --> 02:18:01.484]  If you're verbally assaulted, do not retaliate by getting into physical altercations.
[02:18:01.484 --> 02:18:03.485]  This is for the secret police sneaking around.
[02:18:03.485 --> 02:18:08.726]  Whenever you call, call the local law enforcement authorities.
[02:18:08.726 --> 02:18:11.146]  Whenever you can, call the local law enforcement authorities.
[02:18:11.146 --> 02:18:12.847]  Carry your cell phone.
[02:18:12.847 --> 02:18:14.347]  Six.
[02:18:14.347 --> 02:18:17.128]  U F O U O. Commanders are
[02:18:18.553 --> 02:18:24.635]  Remanded at the time to exercise their physical security plan, including all annexes.
[02:18:24.635 --> 02:18:28.896]  That means sub-directives with weapons.
[02:18:28.896 --> 02:18:43.021]  The annexes concerning civil circumstances and communications with federal agencies and local law enforcement agencies should have increased emphasis due to the upcoming protests scheduled throughout the country.
[02:18:43.021 --> 02:18:45.082]  This is the military working with local police.
[02:18:45.082 --> 02:18:45.482]  Continue.
[02:18:47.999 --> 02:18:52.441]  Well, you're loading the next page, okay.
[02:18:52.441 --> 02:19:00.604]  It goes on, commanders at all levels should establish relationships with local police in order to understand the local threats, or the local threats of evil protesters.
[02:19:00.604 --> 02:19:12.468]  Commanders are encouraged to update alert rosters and review emergency evacuation plans, rally points, ensure all facilities have emergency phone listed below, FBI, fire, police, hospitals, EMS, etc.
[02:19:12.468 --> 02:19:15.069]  Because the evil Americans are coming to protest the private bank.
[02:19:15.689 --> 02:19:23.552]  Commanders will ensure that random anti-terrorism measures program is conducted as an integral part of their daily operations.
[02:19:23.552 --> 02:19:24.893]  See, we're terrorists.
[02:19:24.893 --> 02:19:29.335]  RAM is particularly important due to the static nature of our forces and mission.
[02:19:31.496 --> 02:19:35.237]  Which often result in the establishment of identifiable routes.
[02:19:35.237 --> 02:19:37.939]  Man, they gotta sneak when they come there, because we're so dangerous.
[02:19:37.939 --> 02:19:39.339]  We may attack them.
[02:19:39.339 --> 02:19:41.780]  See, now, oh, they want to attack you.
[02:19:41.780 --> 02:19:43.681]  Oh, they want to go after you.
[02:19:43.681 --> 02:19:51.184]  Report all potential protest activities to the Army Reserve Operations Center, AROC, listed in paragraph 8 below.
[02:19:52.233 --> 02:19:59.099]  And then it lists where this is located and there is actually a phone number here you can call and email addresses for you.
[02:19:59.099 --> 02:20:01.761]  We're gonna come back and Alan Watts take on this and cover it.
[02:20:01.761 --> 02:20:02.642]  You worry.
[02:20:02.642 --> 02:20:04.724]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[02:20:04.724 --> 02:20:07.366]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[02:20:07.366 --> 02:20:09.488]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[02:20:09.488 --> 02:20:11.089]  Your answer may be at hand.
[02:20:11.089 --> 02:20:14.692]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[02:20:14.692 --> 02:20:19.536]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[02:20:19.912 --> 02:20:23.893]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[02:20:23.893 --> 02:20:25.573]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[02:20:25.573 --> 02:20:28.474]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[02:20:28.474 --> 02:20:31.934]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[02:20:31.934 --> 02:20:40.576]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality and joy.
[02:20:40.576 --> 02:20:44.937]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use and store it.
[02:20:45.387 --> 02:20:49.413]  Go to Linda's website, offthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[02:20:49.413 --> 02:20:53.420]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:20:53.420 --> 02:20:54.802]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:20:54.802 --> 02:20:56.544]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[02:21:01.829 --> 02:21:03.931]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:21:03.931 --> 02:21:04.272]  March 23rd, 2009.
[02:21:04.272 --> 02:21:05.273]  Gold opened this morning at $9.5050.
[02:21:05.273 --> 02:21:08.155]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.7767, $4.8884 for the half-ounce, and $2.4442 for a quarter-ounce.
[02:21:08.155 --> 02:21:08.536]  That's $9.7767, $4.8884, or $2.4442.
[02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:24.401]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[02:21:24.401 --> 02:21:27.522]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[02:21:27.522 --> 02:21:37.006]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[02:21:37.006 --> 02:21:42.328]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[02:21:42.808 --> 02:21:45.170]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[02:21:45.170 --> 02:21:48.013]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[02:21:48.013 --> 02:21:49.695]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:21:49.695 --> 02:21:51.136]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[02:21:51.136 --> 02:21:51.397]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:51.397 --> 02:21:51.917]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:21:51.917 --> 02:21:54.460]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:07.765]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:22:07.765 --> 02:22:14.776]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:22:15.336 --> 02:22:21.921]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:22:21.921 --> 02:22:23.903]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:22:23.903 --> 02:22:26.405]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:22:26.405 --> 02:22:37.374]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:22:37.964 --> 02:22:39.645]  It's not about left or right.
[02:22:39.645 --> 02:22:41.507]  It's about a one world government.
[02:22:41.507 --> 02:22:48.412]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:22:48.412 --> 02:22:56.679]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:56.679 --> 02:22:58.260]  The Obama Deception.
[02:22:58.260 --> 02:22:59.461]  The people strike back.
[02:23:02.017 --> 02:23:07.518]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:23:07.518 --> 02:23:08.298]  and the world.
[02:23:08.298 --> 02:23:12.179]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:23:12.179 --> 02:23:18.661]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:23:18.661 --> 02:23:20.701]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:23:20.701 --> 02:23:28.643]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[02:23:28.923 --> 02:23:33.625]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[02:23:33.625 --> 02:23:39.427]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[02:23:39.427 --> 02:23:41.608]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[02:23:41.608 --> 02:23:45.289]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you, free of charge.
[02:23:45.289 --> 02:23:47.410]  Dial 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202, or visit our website at ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[02:23:54.292 --> 02:23:55.533]  We are back live.
[02:23:55.533 --> 02:23:57.874]  Alan Watt with us for the next hour and 40 minutes.
[02:24:15.248 --> 02:24:21.051]  Out of respect for the guest, I'm going to go ahead and go to him now, but I want to finish up later in this hour with the Army Report.
[02:24:21.051 --> 02:24:24.813]  We're calling him again right now, trying to get an interview with him.
[02:24:24.813 --> 02:24:26.314]  And why are they spying on Americans?
[02:24:26.314 --> 02:24:28.194]  Why are they following protesters?
[02:24:28.194 --> 02:24:32.437]  But the fact is, this was leaked to us, just like the state police leaked us the other documents.
[02:24:32.437 --> 02:24:34.358]  They don't like what's happening.
[02:24:34.358 --> 02:24:38.179]  They're upset about what's going on in this country.
[02:24:38.179 --> 02:24:38.940]  But meanwhile,
[02:24:40.683 --> 02:24:51.396]  They are creating a $13 million, and they plan to double that in the next few months, to go knock on your doors, the San Francisco Chronicle reports, as we told you six months ago, and it's in the Obama deception.
[02:24:52.964 --> 02:25:07.988]  Literal classic fascism to push pro-Federal Reserve doctrine and ideas, but then meanwhile if you're against the Federal Reserve, when exercising your First Amendment, you're a dangerous terrorist and they're telling the army who's spying on us, look out, these are dangerous terrorists, they may try to kill you.
[02:25:07.988 --> 02:25:13.130]  I mean, you know, how to protect themselves, how to sneak to the location, how to have weapons, how to look out.
[02:25:13.130 --> 02:25:15.870]  I mean, this is slander, this is demonization.
[02:25:15.870 --> 02:25:17.971]  Alan Watt, I tell you, things are really intensifying.
[02:25:19.215 --> 02:25:21.838]  Yes, they are across the whole world, in fact.
[02:25:21.838 --> 02:25:27.003]  Every country's got its own little program on par with this, in fact.
[02:25:27.003 --> 02:25:31.667]  And it's the creation of total, total tyranny, basically.
[02:25:31.667 --> 02:25:42.818]  And the message is to get it out to the public by the elite themselves, that they are going to stand no nonsense, that they're trying to cow the public into silence and submission by terrorizing them, basically.
[02:25:43.829 --> 02:25:47.873]  And people are generally afraid of being put on a list of some kind or another.
[02:25:47.873 --> 02:25:55.361]  I tell them not to worry, because you're already on some kind of list, if you think at all, whether you know it or not.
[02:25:55.361 --> 02:26:00.747]  And you have to speak now, because we're going into the worst tyranny this planet has ever seen.
[02:26:00.747 --> 02:26:01.367]  This is global.
[02:26:03.100 --> 02:26:03.961]  You're absolutely right.
[02:26:03.961 --> 02:26:12.267]  This is done as a chilling effect and they want the public to know that Army Intelligence is watching, major churches and everybody else.
[02:26:12.267 --> 02:26:15.089]  They want the people to know they're committing these federal crimes.
[02:26:15.089 --> 02:26:16.490]  It is a federal crime to do this.
[02:26:16.490 --> 02:26:23.575]  They suddenly are putting troops at checkpoints and shootings and just to get everybody prepared for that as they implode the world economy.
[02:26:23.575 --> 02:26:25.876]  And the answer is all of us getting on a list.
[02:26:25.876 --> 02:26:30.019]  They can't get all of us and we have to stand up and say, no, what you're doing is criminal.
[02:26:30.019 --> 02:26:31.721]  What you're doing is wrong.
[02:26:33.206 --> 02:26:40.772]  For those that don't know world history, is this not classic tyranny to have secret police with the military spying on the American people?
[02:26:40.772 --> 02:26:53.822]  It's absolutely classic, and now we have Britain admitting not only are they training 60,000 people to spy on the general public from within the general public all the way down to chambermaids in hotels,
[02:26:54.700 --> 02:26:57.921]  But they've already trained thousands of people already quietly.
[02:26:57.921 --> 02:27:01.683]  Well, where did this go through any parliamentary bill?
[02:27:01.683 --> 02:27:04.244]  It was never discussed anywhere.
[02:27:04.244 --> 02:27:09.486]  So really, they're beyond the law, they're beyond democracy, they're beyond parliaments and Congress.
[02:27:09.486 --> 02:27:14.388]  There's a much higher force at work here dictating what's happening.
[02:27:14.388 --> 02:27:23.452]  And to be honest with you, we lost all of that during the Cold War when the intelligence agencies took over, and even politicians were not allowed to know what they were up to.
[02:27:24.236 --> 02:27:39.861]  These high agencies respond to a much higher government, unelected government, comprising of the bankers, of the ultra-rich and elite, and again all the foundations that front for them with their NGOs.
[02:27:39.861 --> 02:27:42.802]  So they're bypassing all the usual channels.
[02:27:42.802 --> 02:27:43.762]  In fact, as I say,
[02:27:44.635 --> 02:27:54.600]  When you go into the writings of the big think tanks that work for this global system on behalf of the elite, like the Club of Rome, they said that democracy was just too cumbersome.
[02:27:54.600 --> 02:27:56.280]  They wanted collectivism.
[02:27:56.280 --> 02:27:59.902]  Under collectivism, you're looking at China, basically.
[02:28:00.478 --> 02:28:01.058]  We're good to go.
[02:28:22.725 --> 02:28:31.369]  Yeah, it's a criminal group of parasites sitting above society calling it capitalist and free market while they suck the population dry.
[02:28:31.369 --> 02:28:41.915]  You know, for those that said we were making it up from his own book and his own documents that they were going to set up youth brigades, a million person domestic spy force, but also serve overseas, the House passed
[02:28:42.615 --> 02:28:43.276]  Absolute denial.
[02:28:43.276 --> 02:28:44.277]  They cannot believe it.
[02:28:44.277 --> 02:28:45.878]  Again, you have a generation that's grown up.
[02:28:45.878 --> 02:28:47.060]  They've forgotten everything.
[02:28:47.060 --> 02:28:49.282]  They've been taught very little at school.
[02:28:49.282 --> 02:28:50.823]  They've never lived through the hard times.
[02:29:05.672 --> 02:29:06.652]  I don't
[02:29:20.166 --> 02:29:26.833]  Uh, and have not, have no history to fall back on, no personal experience of what tyranny can be, or martial law.
[02:29:26.833 --> 02:29:31.157]  So, to them it's all brand new, and they're in utter and complete denial.
[02:29:31.157 --> 02:29:34.840]  And, now that they're taking the old system away, they're giving them the new one.
[02:29:34.840 --> 02:29:44.049]  Force compulsory service, tattletale brigades, 13 person, 13 million person, squads marching the streets, gun control, it's all happening right now.
[02:29:44.049 --> 02:29:45.030]  Alan Watts, stay there.
[02:29:51.696 --> 02:29:55.617]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.617 --> 02:30:01.759]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.759 --> 02:30:05.740]  I'm Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock, and what I'm about to tell you is true.
[02:30:05.740 --> 02:30:10.582]  My real social security number is 457-55-5462.
[02:30:10.582 --> 02:30:13.503]  You may think I'm crazy, but I know my identity is safe.
[02:30:13.503 --> 02:30:17.804]  At LifeLock, every member is covered by our $1 million total service guarantee.
[02:30:17.964 --> 02:30:20.686]  Every three seconds, someone's identity is stolen.
[02:30:20.686 --> 02:30:27.110]  It's not just the money that's being stolen, it's your reputation, your credits, and your valuable time to fix the huge mess.
[02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:30.652]  At LifeLock, we aim to prevent identity theft before it happens.
[02:30:30.652 --> 02:30:37.697]  And if anything happens while you're a client of LifeLock, you'll be protected by our exclusive $1,000,000 total service guarantee.
[02:30:37.697 --> 02:30:42.060]  With LifeLock, you'll also see a huge reduction in junk mail and pre-approved credit offers.
[02:30:42.060 --> 02:30:42.620]  Call 1-800-605-4229 right now.
[02:30:45.182 --> 02:30:47.904]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:31:08.414 --> 02:31:14.299]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:31:14.299 --> 02:31:20.804]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:31:20.804 --> 02:31:22.786]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:31:22.786 --> 02:31:25.248]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:31:25.248 --> 02:31:36.137]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:31:38.425 --> 02:31:40.086]  It's not about left or right.
[02:31:40.086 --> 02:31:41.947]  It's about a one world government.
[02:31:41.947 --> 02:31:48.850]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:31:48.850 --> 02:31:57.114]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:57.114 --> 02:31:58.695]  The Obama Deception.
[02:31:58.695 --> 02:31:59.876]  The people strike back.
[02:32:01.581 --> 02:32:06.663]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[02:32:06.663 --> 02:32:13.746]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free, and can greatly benefit the health of the human body.
[02:32:13.746 --> 02:32:22.770]  By calling 908-691-2608 or visiting hempusa.org, you can benefit from this wonderful natural food source.
[02:32:22.770 --> 02:32:30.193]  Our customers are also purchasing this natural food for long-term storage, camping, survival and emergency food rations.
[02:32:30.694 --> 02:32:36.256]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org today.
[02:32:36.256 --> 02:32:44.798]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future and food will be your greatest asset.
[02:32:44.798 --> 02:32:52.420]  People spend money on all kinds of things, but our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[02:32:52.420 --> 02:32:54.401]  So don't delay, call today.
[02:32:57.884 --> 02:33:01.048]  And see what our powder seeds and oil can do for you!
[02:33:17.173 --> 02:33:21.457]  Right now, up on InfoWars.com, they finally got us the letter.
[02:33:21.457 --> 02:33:23.199]  It's not published anywhere else.
[02:33:23.199 --> 02:33:39.415]  It was mailed by Ron Paul, Bob Barr, and of course Chuck Baldwin to the governor, whose seal was on the top of the federally written document, saying people with Ron Paul stickers are basically terrorists and there's no such thing as the North American Union, and that if you talk about it, you basically are a cop killer.
[02:33:40.740 --> 02:33:43.962]  And so that's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:33:43.962 --> 02:33:48.545]  This brainwashing of the police and the military.
[02:33:48.545 --> 02:33:51.767]  Ron Paul did get more political contributions than any other candidate combined.
[02:33:51.767 --> 02:33:54.309]  The police and military I talked to are waking up.
[02:33:54.309 --> 02:34:01.414]  The elite are not invincible, Alan, and I do see a lot of their people waking up thanks to your work and my work and many other people's work.
[02:34:01.414 --> 02:34:05.857]  I mean, they're certainly moving on us on every front, but there is a big awakening happening.
[02:34:05.857 --> 02:34:07.618]  I mean, I think we've got some hope here.
[02:34:08.996 --> 02:34:10.158]  It's an awakening.
[02:34:10.158 --> 02:34:12.021]  It's a dicey time for those in control.
[02:34:12.021 --> 02:34:14.766]  This is a plan, remember, that we're living through.
[02:34:14.766 --> 02:34:18.893]  This stage of it, I have no doubt, was planned probably 50 years ago or more.
[02:34:19.890 --> 02:34:23.353]  And, uh, it's a very delicate position for them to go through.
[02:34:23.353 --> 02:34:28.918]  That's why they're using the heavy hand and fear tactics to terrify the public, to just go along with it.
[02:34:28.918 --> 02:34:30.839]  But that's a risk for them!
[02:34:30.839 --> 02:34:40.047]  You and others always said that when they finally emerged and went for the World Bank of the World, you know, global government, that by revealing themselves, that was the weak point, because they've always been denying it previously.
[02:34:40.723 --> 02:34:44.807]  That's right, and they're well aware, they are well aware that they could lose this.
[02:34:44.807 --> 02:34:50.373]  That's why they're going to use every tactic possible to keep it on course.
[02:34:50.373 --> 02:34:54.917]  But yeah, it's a very delicate position for them if the people care enough.
[02:34:54.917 --> 02:34:57.320]  The people generally care enough when they have nothing left.
[02:34:58.189 --> 02:35:00.331]  Unfortunately, and by that time it's too late.
[02:35:00.331 --> 02:35:06.776]  You have to be able to think rationally when you're well-fed and all the rest of it to do what you have to do.
[02:35:06.776 --> 02:35:15.763]  And there's no point sitting quietly answering questions to someone coming to your door to make sure you're a good little citizen who's going to comply with all the new rules.
[02:35:15.763 --> 02:35:16.344]  That's right.
[02:35:16.344 --> 02:35:17.345]  Start being vocal now.
[02:35:18.115 --> 02:35:18.815]  I agree with you.
[02:35:18.815 --> 02:35:30.139]  Before they have us in the full depression and pose as our saviors so that we will accept that in the FEMA camps for our safety, people begging in waiting lines to get into the camps.
[02:35:30.139 --> 02:35:36.961]  Always when they did urban warfare drills that I would videotape over a decade ago, they would have the role players screaming, I'm an American, let me in the camp.
[02:35:37.681 --> 02:35:43.988]  And then there'd be a few who didn't want to go to the camp, but most were begging to get in, and now that's how they're selling it today.
[02:35:43.988 --> 02:35:51.155]  We need to get in the face of these thugs, these people knocking on our doors, these neighbors spying on us, and let everybody know that this is criminal.
[02:35:51.155 --> 02:35:52.216]  This is anti-freedom.
[02:35:52.216 --> 02:35:53.798]  This is classical tyranny.
[02:35:53.798 --> 02:35:56.801]  This is what happened in China and is still going on in China.
[02:35:56.801 --> 02:35:57.342]  This is
[02:35:57.822 --> 02:36:02.604]  The criminal elite trying to have a complete and total criminal takeover.
[02:36:02.604 --> 02:36:11.927]  And Alan, I totally agree with you that we've got to scream bloody murder now and point out that it's the private Federal Reserve and the New World Order globally that are carrying this out.
[02:36:11.927 --> 02:36:17.749]  That's why they're so scared of us protesting the Fed and getting media attention and pointing out they're the bad guys.
[02:36:17.749 --> 02:36:20.190]  That's why while we were there protesting the Fed in Dallas,
[02:36:21.050 --> 02:36:30.214]  They had over 200 professors and school teachers in there indoctrinating them and paying them to be part of a course to go out and then brainwash people about how great the Federal Reserve is.
[02:36:30.214 --> 02:36:35.217]  So they've got a massive PR campaign admittedly going right now.
[02:36:35.217 --> 02:36:37.858]  Yes, and I think Solzhenitsyn was quite right.
[02:36:37.858 --> 02:36:40.359]  He said you have to stop this right at the beginning.
[02:36:40.359 --> 02:36:46.522]  They said once they get going, and what they did in the Soviet system, and I can see it coming down here, they're copying it.
[02:36:46.522 --> 02:36:47.923]  That was a trial for the whole world.
[02:36:48.860 --> 02:36:59.284]  They turned out the whole street when the KGB went in to arrest a couple of people and drag them out to make sure that everyone got the message to terrify everybody in the street.
[02:36:59.284 --> 02:37:01.984]  And that made everyone draw into their little cell.
[02:37:01.984 --> 02:37:03.205]  They didn't talk to their neighbours.
[02:37:03.205 --> 02:37:07.566]  You just went through life quietly looking at the ground, the sidewalk.
[02:37:07.566 --> 02:37:16.089]  And that's what they hoped to use here for a whole generation while they go through this whole course into the next step of globalisation.
[02:37:16.089 --> 02:37:17.150]  So we can't let that happen.
[02:37:17.150 --> 02:37:18.230]  You've got to hit it right now.
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:20.961]  And don't be afraid.
[02:37:20.961 --> 02:37:22.962]  Yeah, right now is the crossroads.
[02:37:22.962 --> 02:37:25.243]  Either they win, or we defeat them.
[02:37:25.243 --> 02:37:32.327]  Right now, the good news is, as I was saying earlier, the resistance to this tyranny is really mounting, and a lot of people see it.
[02:37:32.327 --> 02:37:39.230]  But on top of that, I get dozens of articles every day just like this one, and I'm so busy, I never even cover half of them.
[02:37:39.230 --> 02:37:42.932]  Alan, here is the Associated Press.
[02:37:42.932 --> 02:37:46.074]  This is the Associated Press today.
[02:37:47.814 --> 02:37:50.475]  And you'd think you were living in Communist Russia to hear this.
[02:37:50.475 --> 02:37:53.816]  Hillary, the movie, now showing at Supreme Court.
[02:37:53.816 --> 02:38:13.442]  And you read the article, it says, the Supreme Court will decide if you're allowed to make a film criticizing government leaders, and that it is under election law now to make a film criticizing any elected official, and that they're deciding, not just the Fairness Doctrine for talk radio,
[02:38:14.022 --> 02:38:17.670]  But they're deciding to restrict free speech on the internet, everything.
[02:38:17.670 --> 02:38:20.616]  That's what the Violent Radicalization Act is about.
[02:38:20.616 --> 02:38:25.145]  That's what these different... I mean, the article actually says that
[02:38:26.064 --> 02:38:29.607]  That they may basically ban this movie and not let it be shown or be seen.
[02:38:29.607 --> 02:38:49.883]  And this fight's been going on since last year during the election, so... But meanwhile, Obama and the government can run national TV ads advertising people to join usaservice.org, which is a private Democratic Party group with 13 million, San Francisco Chronicle reported, and he announced it on Jay Leno, knocking on your door saying, do you pledge?
[02:38:49.883 --> 02:38:51.064]  Are you with us?
[02:38:51.064 --> 02:38:52.726]  I mean, this is happening faster than I thought.
[02:38:53.985 --> 02:38:55.586]  Yeah, again, because it was planned that way.
[02:38:55.586 --> 02:38:57.868]  Long before Obama, we even heard his name.
[02:38:57.868 --> 02:39:00.891]  He was groomed for this, to take over from Bush.
[02:39:00.891 --> 02:39:04.894]  They had them all set up like ducks in a row for the decade.
[02:39:04.894 --> 02:39:06.676]  And this is all planned ahead.
[02:39:06.676 --> 02:39:16.805]  That's why it's going ahead so quickly, smoothly, because it was all done, all the paperwork was done, implementation techniques were worked out before he was even elected into office.
[02:39:16.805 --> 02:39:19.026]  So, this is why it's going this way.
[02:39:19.026 --> 02:39:20.548]  The same thing happened in Britain.
[02:39:21.048 --> 02:39:24.669]  Yeah, you have a big organization called Common Purpose.
[02:39:24.669 --> 02:39:29.070]  It uses the techniques of the Royal Institute for International Affairs, or the CFR.
[02:39:29.070 --> 02:39:39.652]  It has military commanders as members of it, high commanders, and high police officials, MI6 and all the rest of it, which tells me that this is a branch that's already been trained.
[02:39:39.652 --> 02:39:42.752]  This is a new NGO that's been trained by Mr. Brown.
[02:39:42.752 --> 02:39:44.673]  As he said, they've already trained thousands.
[02:39:44.673 --> 02:39:46.773]  That falls right into that category.
[02:39:46.773 --> 02:39:49.794]  So they're using these strange civilian systems
[02:39:50.254 --> 02:39:53.636]  Yeah, the quote is, it would be better off if we never had the internet.
[02:39:53.636 --> 02:39:53.837]  Go ahead.
[02:40:19.514 --> 02:40:28.041]  That's right, and then you tie that in with Australia, where, now, whatever happens in the world today, you can guarantee it's going to work across the board, across the whole world.
[02:40:28.041 --> 02:40:35.947]  In Australia, they're going to start, they're going to fine people $11,000 per day for having illegal sites up on the web.
[02:40:35.947 --> 02:40:38.609]  And these illegal sites are banned by the government.
[02:40:38.609 --> 02:40:41.011]  You won't even know if you're on the list until you get one.
[02:40:41.011 --> 02:40:42.712]  It's only mainstream news!
[02:40:42.712 --> 02:40:43.433]  Hyperlink!
[02:40:44.073 --> 02:41:00.885]  If you hyperlink to Wikilinks or any of these sites, thousands and thousands being added a week, then, and it's up to you to know if it's a banned site, and then the headline is, Chinese style net censorship coming, the government says that themselves and says you'll only be able to visit a few thousand sites.
[02:41:01.485 --> 02:41:22.833]  And I was listening to the British Lord, the inventor of the internet, on BBC this weekend in the car, on XM, and he admitted, yes, we're killing the old web right now, and everything you do is being tracked and traced, and the New York Times a month ago announced, we are getting rid of the old web, it will be a safer, friendlier, gatekeep, they use that term, gatekeeping web, that we control.
[02:41:22.833 --> 02:41:25.014]  Now, just backing you up, going back about two minutes,
[02:41:26.121 --> 02:41:37.288]  And I want you to continue on the line of censorship, you know, how they're bringing out just this diametrically opposed to liberty and freedom and the Magna Carta and Bill of Rights and just basic freedom, this obvious criminality by the state.
[02:41:37.288 --> 02:41:40.830]  And you mentioned almost military level clearance.
[02:41:40.830 --> 02:41:48.115]  Under InfraGard, 50,000 executives in infrastructure protection, they're armed, they're trained by the FBI secretly, now it's in the Associated Press.
[02:41:48.115 --> 02:41:52.218]  We shoot to kill orders of whoever they're told to kill in their company when the FBI tells them.
[02:41:53.138 --> 02:41:58.679]  They have the 26,000 clergy response teams preparing everybody to go to the camps and take forced inoculations.
[02:41:58.679 --> 02:42:00.340]  We told you a year and a half before it was declassified.
[02:42:00.340 --> 02:42:02.920]  It's now public, mainstream news.
[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:07.861]  And they've now announced this one million man, and the Pentagon put out the directive a month ago.
[02:42:07.861 --> 02:42:08.981]  Obama's now announced it.
[02:42:08.981 --> 02:42:12.262]  The House passed it Friday, Thursday, excuse me.
[02:42:12.262 --> 02:42:13.162]  We read the bill on air.
[02:42:13.162 --> 02:42:14.543]  It's now passed, going to the Senate.
[02:42:14.543 --> 02:42:15.983]  Sure to pass it, they're saying.
[02:42:15.983 --> 02:42:20.464]  There's no big debate about it, only a few mainstream articles, and we've covered it.
[02:42:20.464 --> 02:42:21.124]  And they say,
[02:42:21.664 --> 02:42:40.199]  That they're setting up a body to organize the compulsory service of the American people from middle school to age 65 and a 1 million person 18 to 24 cadre that will serve domestically and overseas in the Army, the Defense Department Directive, states.
[02:42:40.199 --> 02:42:42.681]  We've read this on air the last three shows in a row, read it last night.
[02:42:43.842 --> 02:42:45.863]  It's up on presentplanet.com, a link to the Pentagon.
[02:42:45.863 --> 02:42:50.466]  They say it will be compulsory and they will tell you to be here or overseas.
[02:42:50.466 --> 02:42:55.829]  I mean, this is literal Joseph Stalin, Marcus Wolf level.
[02:42:55.829 --> 02:42:57.150]  Yeah, it's right in the open.
[02:42:57.150 --> 02:42:59.772]  Openly, absolutely.
[02:42:59.772 --> 02:43:04.655]  But it even amazes me, Alan, that this quick, this fast, this overwhelming
[02:43:07.819 --> 02:43:16.527]  I mean, if they were shooting for tyranny and there's a score of one to a hundred, they are getting a one hundred and ten, you know, with a triple stars bonus.
[02:43:16.527 --> 02:43:20.271]  Yes, they have to go the whole way fast.
[02:43:20.271 --> 02:43:23.234]  They can't just implement a stage at a time and take the flak.
[02:43:23.234 --> 02:43:30.801]  They're trying to use a short tactic and run it all through at once and then deal with any comeback from it, any fallback.
[02:43:31.755 --> 02:43:33.276]  This is literally Red Dawn.
[02:43:33.276 --> 02:43:43.682]  I mean this is classic military standing by watching the American people while the banks openly destroy the economy by design and openly announce world government.
[02:43:43.682 --> 02:43:44.143]  That's right.
[02:43:44.143 --> 02:43:48.645]  That's what the World Bank was set up to do and the United Nations as well.
[02:43:48.645 --> 02:43:54.149]  I've got the books written at the time when they were setting up the UN and they mentioned all these institutions
[02:43:54.645 --> 02:44:01.892]  And he said that probably the World Bank will not come up to its full purpose power for about 50 years.
[02:44:01.892 --> 02:44:04.535]  Well, we're right on target.
[02:44:04.535 --> 02:44:04.815]  I know.
[02:44:04.815 --> 02:44:06.797]  It's just amazing, Alan, to know this.
[02:44:06.797 --> 02:44:08.178]  And I want listeners to understand something.
[02:44:08.178 --> 02:44:10.661]  We've posted all the government bills, all the documents.
[02:44:12.492 --> 02:44:13.213]  This is real.
[02:44:13.213 --> 02:44:13.934]  This is happening.
[02:44:13.934 --> 02:44:15.035]  We're not exaggerating.
[02:44:15.035 --> 02:44:21.902]  In fact, it's so bad, it's so huge, that I can't even in one show list all of the evidence.
[02:44:21.902 --> 02:44:25.806]  I mean, it's admitted that they're doing this.
[02:44:25.806 --> 02:44:26.787]  Yes, it's in the open.
[02:44:26.787 --> 02:44:29.029]  It's a shock in all tactics they're using.
[02:44:29.784 --> 02:44:32.026]  Because most people, as you say, cannot believe it.
[02:44:32.026 --> 02:44:32.946]  It's overwhelming.
[02:44:32.946 --> 02:44:39.611]  And most of them are not used, most of the public, truly, honestly, are not used to thinking about what they hear.
[02:44:39.611 --> 02:44:41.892]  It goes in one ear, out the other.
[02:44:41.892 --> 02:44:45.935]  They won't believe it until their sons and daughters are whisked off.
[02:44:45.935 --> 02:44:51.639]  And they themselves are pushed in, if they're under 65 or whatever, into serving in some capacity or another.
[02:44:53.835 --> 02:44:55.436]  Well, I mean, I could go over it.
[02:44:55.436 --> 02:45:03.219]  It's got an EnviroCorp, EnvironmentCorp, GreenCorp, SecurityCorp.
[02:45:03.219 --> 02:45:07.561]  In fact, I've got it in my stack out there, guys, from last night's show.
[02:45:07.561 --> 02:45:11.283]  Will you bring me the big, huge stack over there on the table?
[02:45:11.283 --> 02:45:12.343]  Well, there's like five stacks.
[02:45:12.343 --> 02:45:13.203]  It's the big one.
[02:45:13.203 --> 02:45:14.184]  You know, I'll get it during a break.
[02:45:14.184 --> 02:45:14.644]  It doesn't matter.
[02:45:14.644 --> 02:45:15.925]  You'll bring me the wrong stack.
[02:45:15.925 --> 02:45:16.885]  You couldn't know where it is.
[02:45:16.885 --> 02:45:17.625]  It doesn't matter.
[02:45:17.625 --> 02:45:18.966]  It's right over there on the conference table.
[02:45:20.134 --> 02:45:20.915]  No, no, just forget it.
[02:45:20.915 --> 02:45:21.475]  Just forget it.
[02:45:21.475 --> 02:45:22.276]  I don't want all the stacks.
[02:45:22.276 --> 02:45:24.897]  There's like 50 stacks out there.
[02:45:24.897 --> 02:45:26.158]  You know, what's the point?
[02:45:26.158 --> 02:45:31.522]  I mean, I keep covering it, giving them the subsections, giving them where it says it, how they're doing it.
[02:45:31.522 --> 02:45:32.783]  It's just mind-blowing, Alan.
[02:45:32.783 --> 02:45:33.664]  I keep saying that.
[02:45:33.664 --> 02:45:38.747]  I mean, don't people understand this is classic hardcore tyranny?
[02:45:38.747 --> 02:45:39.128]  They don't.
[02:45:39.128 --> 02:45:45.272]  A generation has grown up, really, living with fantasy and virtual reality.
[02:45:46.153 --> 02:45:51.241]  And the older generation has been dying off, those with memory of what tyranny was all about.
[02:45:51.241 --> 02:45:53.845]  And therefore it's brand new again for this generation.
[02:45:53.845 --> 02:46:00.215]  They've been almost mollycoddled to an extent for quite some time living in entertainment land.
[02:46:00.925 --> 02:46:01.406]  I don't know.
[02:46:17.208 --> 02:46:17.949]  We're good to go.
[02:46:35.570 --> 02:46:38.372]  And that's what George Orwell was talking about in 1984.
[02:46:38.372 --> 02:46:52.964]  The ability to believe everything you're told today, when you're given a new reality tomorrow, you must delete your old realities that never existed and be politically correct, day by day, week by week, etc.
[02:46:52.964 --> 02:46:59.629]  And we're seeing that now with the whole thing with Gulf War I into Gulf War II.
[02:46:59.629 --> 02:47:02.892]  You start off with Afghanistan, they changed their sights into Iraq.
[02:47:03.516 --> 02:47:05.177]  Then they change it to Iran.
[02:47:05.177 --> 02:47:07.037]  Now they're going for Pakistan.
[02:47:07.037 --> 02:47:08.578]  They keep changing their enemy.
[02:47:08.578 --> 02:47:09.819]  Who are we fighting today?
[02:47:09.819 --> 02:47:11.539]  East Asia or West Asia?
[02:47:11.539 --> 02:47:15.121]  And you better believe it's always been West Asia or whoever they tell you.
[02:47:15.121 --> 02:47:16.221]  That's what's coming.
[02:47:16.221 --> 02:47:21.963]  A hyper-speed, constant upgrade to everybody to be politically correct at all times.
[02:47:21.963 --> 02:47:28.486]  And they're going to monitor us to make sure that the program is working with us and we are upgraded all through our lives.
[02:47:29.127 --> 02:47:39.956]  That's right, the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, the different think tanks, Tavistock and the UN and others bragged, and we've read these documents on air, that
[02:47:41.604 --> 02:48:10.663]  What they would do is bankrupt everybody, get everybody dependent, get everybody institutionalized, finally bankrupt the middle class, and then your job will be continual education that's government paid for, and then they'll put you in government jobs while the brainwashing and the continuing education continues, always giving you the new reality, downloading it, and now that's what they admit the new world order is going to be, is basically a giant re-education camp, and they play this off on these fools.
[02:48:10.663 --> 02:48:11.044]  They tell them,
[02:48:12.104 --> 02:48:14.946]  You've got to do what Obama says or the economy won't get better.
[02:48:14.946 --> 02:48:18.209]  It's the people that are fighting Obama that are causing this to happen.
[02:48:18.209 --> 02:48:20.270]  Obama's fighting the special interest.
[02:48:20.270 --> 02:48:27.295]  That's why 13 million of them need to go door-to-door, banging on people's doors, demanding they pledge to accept the banker takeover.
[02:48:27.295 --> 02:48:31.698]  And these fools really believe they're fighting the establishment.
[02:48:32.498 --> 02:48:38.159]  As they are part of this, as the establishment openly is the author of the entire thing.
[02:48:38.159 --> 02:48:43.581]  And you talk to Obama supporters and they say, he never said he wasn't going to hire a lobbyist.
[02:48:43.581 --> 02:48:46.361]  He never said he wasn't going to bring the troops home.
[02:48:46.361 --> 02:48:49.022]  He never said that he was going to do any of that.
[02:48:49.022 --> 02:48:49.842]  And I go, yes he did.
[02:48:49.842 --> 02:48:50.883]  And they go, no he didn't.
[02:48:50.883 --> 02:48:52.503]  You're just an evil Republican.
[02:48:52.503 --> 02:48:54.623]  And you say, no, you're caught in the left-right paradigm.
[02:48:54.623 --> 02:48:56.084]  They control you with that bait-and-switch.
[02:48:56.084 --> 02:48:58.084]  And they go, shut up, Republican!
[02:48:58.084 --> 02:48:59.385]  You lost the election.
[02:48:59.385 --> 02:48:59.845]  I won.
[02:49:01.161 --> 02:49:11.383]  I see that in the comments on my film online, is every other comment that disagrees says, hey get over it, you lost Republicans, get over it, Obama's going to beat you.
[02:49:11.383 --> 02:49:13.844]  You know what, we're going to arrest you right wingers.
[02:49:13.844 --> 02:49:17.544]  You know, he's going to bring in a heaven, I'm not going to have bills anymore.
[02:49:17.544 --> 02:49:29.467]  And in a way they're not, they're going to be in little uniforms and little brigades on power trips, you know, totally dumbed down fluoride heads, ADIQs, just totally going insane just like Hitler's brown shirts.
[02:49:30.943 --> 02:49:31.684]  There's no doubt.
[02:49:31.684 --> 02:49:32.845]  This is a formula.
[02:49:32.845 --> 02:49:40.250]  What you're seeing is a formula that's well tried and tested over centuries, many centuries, and they know exactly how to implement it.
[02:49:40.250 --> 02:49:50.377]  As I say, it's obvious that the whole formula was set up and the machinery to implement it was set up long before Obama was even heard of.
[02:49:50.377 --> 02:49:51.418]  Alan, what do we do?
[02:49:51.418 --> 02:49:53.359]  This takes time to get going.
[02:49:53.359 --> 02:49:55.000]  This is rolling already.
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.022]  You can do it yourself when they put something forward.
[02:49:57.783 --> 02:50:05.828]  Before it becomes a bill or anything else, it takes sometimes years to get through all the different details, etc., back to committee, etc.
[02:50:05.828 --> 02:50:08.589]  This is already implemented to go.
[02:50:08.589 --> 02:50:15.013]  Yeah, you're an amazing individual, Alan, because you research the same core documents I do, in great detail, and we're very honored to have you.
[02:50:15.013 --> 02:50:21.376]  Your website is CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com, and then you have a European mirror, don't you?
[02:50:21.376 --> 02:50:23.197]  Yeah, that's alanwattsentinel.eu, yeah.
[02:50:25.100 --> 02:50:29.104]  And we've got those up on screen for folks right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:50:29.104 --> 02:50:30.786]  And I know I'm jumping in a lot when Alan's on.
[02:50:30.786 --> 02:50:34.850]  I do that because everything he's saying is documented, and then I'm just backing it all up.
[02:50:34.850 --> 02:50:41.597]  And I want to come back and talk about ways to counter this, ways to defeat this, because we are getting through to some of the Obamanoids.
[02:50:41.597 --> 02:50:44.159]  The Obama deception has been very, very effective at that.
[02:50:44.159 --> 02:50:46.662]  Any of your ideas of breaking through their conditioning?
[02:50:47.202 --> 02:50:51.743]  And showing them how they're being classically brainwashed to carry this out.
[02:50:51.743 --> 02:50:54.244]  And then as everything gets worse, they say, it's your fault.
[02:50:54.244 --> 02:50:55.584]  You didn't do what Obama said.
[02:50:55.584 --> 02:50:57.205]  You made the bad things happen.
[02:50:57.205 --> 02:50:58.185]  This is sick, folks.
[02:50:58.185 --> 02:51:01.986]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.986 --> 02:51:04.567]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[02:51:05.214 --> 02:51:08.536]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[02:51:08.536 --> 02:51:12.318]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[02:51:12.318 --> 02:51:18.901]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[02:51:18.901 --> 02:51:24.124]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[02:51:24.124 --> 02:51:30.847]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[02:51:31.147 --> 02:51:32.228]  Need something more?
[02:51:32.228 --> 02:51:36.193]  The Scorpion Stun Gun is a great way to take down a potential attacker.
[02:51:36.193 --> 02:51:44.483]  Mr. Defense also carries the largest selection of air tasers, knives, self-defense keychains, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.
[02:51:44.483 --> 02:51:48.828]  Mention this ad and receive 10% off of your order and a free self-defense keychain.
[02:51:49.108 --> 02:51:52.769]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:51:52.769 --> 02:51:56.430]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:52:15.999 --> 02:52:22.585]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:22.585 --> 02:52:24.567]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:24.567 --> 02:52:27.070]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:27.070 --> 02:52:38.020]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:38.630 --> 02:52:40.291]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:40.291 --> 02:52:42.152]  It's about a one world government.
[02:52:42.152 --> 02:52:49.077]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:52:49.077 --> 02:52:57.342]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:57.342 --> 02:52:58.903]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:58.903 --> 02:53:00.104]  The people strike back.
[02:53:02.381 --> 02:53:03.501]  Spring is here.
[02:53:03.501 --> 02:53:04.462]  Growing season.
[02:53:04.462 --> 02:53:06.662]  The economy is not getting any better.
[02:53:06.662 --> 02:53:08.363]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[02:53:08.363 --> 02:53:09.343]  Think about it.
[02:53:09.343 --> 02:53:13.424]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[02:53:13.424 --> 02:53:17.165]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[02:53:17.165 --> 02:53:19.065]  The country is running out of food.
[02:53:19.065 --> 02:53:21.586]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[02:53:21.906 --> 02:53:34.100]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[02:53:34.100 --> 02:53:36.783]  Grow your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass,
[02:53:36.783 --> 02:53:36.983]  I think so.
[02:54:25.678 --> 02:54:31.620]  Look at this, it says Hillary the Movie, now showing at Supreme Court.
[02:54:31.620 --> 02:54:35.802]  Months after its debut, Hillary the Movie faces nine of the nation's toughest critics at the Supreme Court.
[02:54:35.802 --> 02:54:44.665]  The Justice Review of the slashing documentary, financed by longtime critics of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, could bring more than just thumbs up or thumbs down.
[02:54:44.665 --> 02:54:50.247]  It may settle the question of whether the government can regulate a politically charged film as a campaign ad.
[02:54:51.067 --> 02:54:59.873]  And they go on to say the former Republican Congressional aide who produced the Clinton movie and another described then-Senator Barack Obama as an overhyped media darling.
[02:54:59.873 --> 02:55:01.273]  Oh, is that allowed?
[02:55:01.273 --> 02:55:04.015]  Said that his films are about important moments in American politics.
[02:55:04.015 --> 02:55:08.418]  The outcome of this case will dictate how we're able to make films and educate people about them.
[02:55:08.418 --> 02:55:14.261]  At issue is the case being argued before justices tomorrow is the 90-minute anti-Clinton movie and television ads.
[02:55:15.262 --> 02:55:19.464]  Bossy wanted to air during 2008 primaries advertising the film.
[02:55:19.464 --> 02:55:27.049]  So see, all the big money can spend $2 billion outside of the regular campaign money and the fake global warming ads and all of it, that's okay.
[02:55:27.049 --> 02:55:30.711]  And they can run political ads to get Obama an army of supporters.
[02:55:31.536 --> 02:55:33.076]  That's okay.
[02:55:33.076 --> 02:55:35.737]  But see, they're going to selectively enforce and set the precedent.
[02:55:35.737 --> 02:55:39.858]  Bossy's group, the Conservative Citizens United, released the movie as the Clintons.
[02:55:39.858 --> 02:55:42.979]  A New York senator was competing with Obama for Democratic presidential nomination.
[02:55:42.979 --> 02:55:50.640]  The movie is unquestionably anti-Obama, featuring commentary from conservative pundits, some of whom specifically say Clinton was not fit to be commander-in-chief.
[02:55:50.640 --> 02:55:52.381]  Imagine America having free speech!
[02:55:53.221 --> 02:56:03.047]  One scene, which was used in the ad, has Dick Morris, a former advisor to Clinton, who is now a critic of the Clintons, saying the senator is a closest thing we have in America to a European socialist.
[02:56:03.047 --> 02:56:04.728]  The movie was shown in eight theaters.
[02:56:04.728 --> 02:56:06.028]  Oh my gosh.
[02:56:06.028 --> 02:56:13.352]  And it goes, federal court said the ads would violate McCain's Feingold Law, the popular name for 2002 revisions of the nation's campaign finance law.
[02:56:13.352 --> 02:56:15.374]  And that law says basically no free speech.
[02:56:15.374 --> 02:56:17.435]  I can't say I'm pro-gun, that's political.
[02:56:17.435 --> 02:56:19.156]  I can't say I'm pro-border, that's political.
[02:56:19.716 --> 02:56:21.417]  Alan Watt, your comments on this.
[02:56:21.417 --> 02:56:25.258]  And the AP reports it like, oh, it's reasonable.
[02:56:25.258 --> 02:56:27.459]  This is unquestionably anti-Clinton.
[02:56:27.459 --> 02:56:28.780]  Maybe this shouldn't be allowed.
[02:56:28.780 --> 02:56:33.122]  I mean, this is outrageous that they're even proposing this.
[02:56:33.122 --> 02:56:34.242]  Again, it falls right in.
[02:56:34.242 --> 02:56:40.025]  They want to get the message out there to the public to just be a good little citizen and be quiet.
[02:56:40.891 --> 02:56:50.798]  And leave everything to government and government agencies, have no opinion, and definitely don't try to encroach upon what they see as their territory now.
[02:56:50.798 --> 02:56:54.641]  They'll give the propaganda, no one else can give propaganda.
[02:56:54.641 --> 02:56:58.003]  That's happening too, to John Anthony Hill in Ireland.
[02:56:58.003 --> 02:57:02.786]  He was a guy who did 7-7 ripple effect about the bombings.
[02:57:02.786 --> 02:57:09.271]  And he used clips all through, from regular television, BBC and so on, strung it all together, asked the right questions,
[02:57:09.790 --> 02:57:22.294]  But he did, apparently, at least he's accused of sending out the videos to the judge and the jury, and he's up on basically terrorism charges to be extradited from Ireland for making that movie, basically.
[02:57:22.294 --> 02:57:27.195]  And is to be taken off to Westminster, which is the terrorism court for Europe, basically, at the moment.
[02:57:27.976 --> 02:57:30.818]  And so they're getting the message out in all the countries now.
[02:57:30.818 --> 02:57:33.999]  You just can't go ahead and do this kind of stuff on your own.
[02:57:33.999 --> 02:57:35.740]  Don't interfere on our territory.
[02:57:35.740 --> 02:57:37.441]  This is our territory.
[02:57:37.441 --> 02:57:40.662]  You will be put in the slammer for life, and that's the charge against them.
[02:57:40.662 --> 02:57:48.486]  Hey, we've had the FBI calling this office, asking us questions concerning how we put out the Obama deception and things.
[02:57:48.486 --> 02:57:51.068]  I mean, they are really trying to intimidate right now.
[02:57:51.068 --> 02:57:51.788]  Yes, they are.
[02:57:51.788 --> 02:57:55.770]  They're going to make sure that eventually, and they will make examples of different people
[02:57:56.642 --> 02:58:03.912]  And as I see this one in Ireland, if this goes through, that he's attempting to pervert the course of justice is the charge.
[02:58:03.912 --> 02:58:05.414]  He faces life in prison.
[02:58:05.414 --> 02:58:05.915]  Life.
[02:58:05.915 --> 02:58:06.035]  Yeah.
[02:58:08.012 --> 02:58:24.383]  And it's an excellent film, 7-7 Ripple Effect, folks, documenting, because he has the newscast where they killed the patsies, these supposed bombers who they hired for an anti-terror drill, which they admit they were running and bombing the exact same trains and buses at the exact same time.
[02:58:24.383 --> 02:58:28.406]  Very effective film, and boy, he's on his way to life in prison right now.
[02:58:29.867 --> 02:58:31.589]  Just unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:31.589 --> 02:58:33.010]  Alan Watt back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:33.010 --> 02:58:36.694]  I want to continue going over the news with you and taking phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:58:36.694 --> 02:58:37.175]  Stay with us.
[02:58:37.175 --> 02:58:38.676]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:51.578 --> 02:58:53.259]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.259 --> 02:58:58.001]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:58.001 --> 02:59:00.982]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.982 --> 02:59:04.003]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:04.003 --> 02:59:08.725]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:59:08.965 --> 02:59:10.085]  If you simply prepare.
[02:59:10.085 --> 02:59:13.327]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.327 --> 02:59:20.330]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:20.330 --> 02:59:23.591]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:59:23.591 --> 02:59:23.851]  Call 1-800-409-5633.

[02:59:40.138 --> 02:59:40.758]  Take action today.
[02:59:40.758 --> 02:59:42.579]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.338 --> 02:59:56.726]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.726 --> 02:59:59.516]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:07.151 --> 03:00:08.471]  Alan Watt is our guest.
[03:00:08.471 --> 03:00:13.293]  He's been nice enough to agree, I believe, Wednesday night to come on for a couple hours with Jason Burmess.
[03:00:13.293 --> 03:00:16.274]  That'll be a different style of interview and they'll be taking calls as well then.
[03:00:16.274 --> 03:00:17.474]  We have an hour left.
[03:00:17.474 --> 03:00:21.195]  Alan, I've found a lot of articles and topics I wanted you to comment on.
[03:00:21.195 --> 03:00:24.756]  I want to get into the global economic meltdown, where that's going.
[03:00:24.756 --> 03:00:27.777]  But first, solutions.
[03:00:27.777 --> 03:00:31.278]  Studying the enemy's programming, how they brainwash, how they condition the public.
[03:00:32.443 --> 03:00:33.564]  How do we reach out to them?
[03:00:33.564 --> 03:00:39.050]  Because you're right, there's a blitzkrieg motion as they hit us with all their world government operations.
[03:00:39.050 --> 03:00:43.655]  They've built up, they've prepared militarily, psychologically, economically.
[03:00:43.655 --> 03:00:47.378]  Now, at one time, they're launching at every level.
[03:00:47.378 --> 03:00:49.921]  Past the National Draft Friday, about to pass the Senate.
[03:00:49.921 --> 03:00:51.603]  I mean, again, I shouldn't be talking about nothing but that.
[03:00:51.603 --> 03:00:53.425]  But we're being hit from every angle.
[03:00:55.471 --> 03:00:56.572]  And I see a lot of tactics.
[03:00:56.572 --> 03:00:58.594]  You know, they're still doing a lot of this covertly.
[03:00:58.594 --> 03:01:03.257]  You know, it's public, but they're not giving any attention to other things they're admitting to.
[03:01:03.257 --> 03:01:04.978]  How do we reach out to people?
[03:01:04.978 --> 03:01:09.421]  How do we get the people to rally against this now?
[03:01:09.421 --> 03:01:11.903]  It's a hard thing.
[03:01:11.903 --> 03:01:21.530]  T. Brzezinski and others that are masters of studying masses, the masses as they call it, human psychology, know that
[03:01:22.580 --> 03:01:35.291]  And he said in his own book, Between Two Ages, he said, most of the public shortly will be unable to think or reason for themselves, though they expect the mainstream media to do it for them.
[03:01:35.291 --> 03:01:37.092]  That's our problem.
[03:01:37.092 --> 03:01:41.416]  Our generation's grown up and they truly believe everything that's given to them on television.
[03:01:42.105 --> 03:01:48.669]  If it's not been on television and you bring up the topic, even if you have the evidence in front of you, they'll dismiss it.
[03:01:48.669 --> 03:01:54.834]  So we're dealing with psychological warfare and its impact and its effects.
[03:01:54.834 --> 03:02:03.719]  Most people, unfortunately, as I say, won't react until it hits them personally at their doorstep or on their doorstep.
[03:02:03.719 --> 03:02:05.821]  The Constitution was the only thing really
[03:02:06.556 --> 03:02:15.059]  They give you any protection, but you could at least say, hey, look here, you've got to change this or throw it out legally before you can come in with a new system.
[03:02:15.059 --> 03:02:22.542]  And if effectively bypassed that and basically ignored it, the public never know what they have until they lose it, unfortunately.
[03:02:22.542 --> 03:02:26.403]  And if they're not willing to stand up for something now, they never will.
[03:02:26.403 --> 03:02:30.905]  You can't stand up for something when you're in prison camps behind barbed wire.
[03:02:30.905 --> 03:02:31.845]  You've had it by then.
[03:02:32.705 --> 03:02:35.828]  And remember, they're talking about a hundred years war.
[03:02:35.828 --> 03:02:38.731]  That was said right after 9-11.
[03:02:38.731 --> 03:02:40.793]  This is going to be a hundred years war.
[03:02:40.793 --> 03:02:41.954]  And that was never explained.
[03:02:41.954 --> 03:02:46.078]  These little phrases come out, but it's never explained to the general public.
[03:02:46.078 --> 03:02:53.885]  They expect to achieve their whole goal of eugenics, depopulation, the totally controlled society, etc.
[03:02:53.885 --> 03:02:55.947]  to be over and completed and done with.
[03:02:56.821 --> 03:02:57.281]  I don't
[03:03:10.766 --> 03:03:15.209]  Um, to be in control of the economic system like all wars are.
[03:03:15.209 --> 03:03:17.671]  They'll have conscription, etc, etc, etc.
[03:03:17.671 --> 03:03:19.693]  And notice, I've got to stop you.
[03:03:19.693 --> 03:03:20.913]  Hold the thought.
[03:03:20.913 --> 03:03:28.219]  Now in England, the U.S., in California, they shut off the three big water supplies for different fish and things they claim are endangered.
[03:03:28.219 --> 03:03:31.001]  Suddenly they have to ration water in England.
[03:03:31.001 --> 03:03:36.665]  The head of the operation in the London Telegraph this weekend said, we're going to ration water, not just carbon footprint, but
[03:03:37.125 --> 03:03:43.847]  But water footprint, training you to have less even though England has more water than any other country per capita in the world.
[03:03:43.847 --> 03:03:57.891]  They are literally bringing control into every facet and they're saying ration cards, I've had the top eugenicist on who consulted the UN, they're in the headlines saying we're all going to have ration cards for our carbon footprint.
[03:03:57.891 --> 03:04:05.193]  I mean, and the bureaucrats in our homes ruling us and now Obama, they've introduced bills to basically ban all gardens without licenses.
[03:04:05.193 --> 03:04:06.153]  I mean, it's all happening!
[03:04:06.724 --> 03:04:16.571]  Yes, and they can come into your house now in Britain and go through your refrigerator and advise you how to cook, how much to store, and what you're wasting, and so on.
[03:04:16.571 --> 03:04:17.692]  This is how bad it is.
[03:04:17.692 --> 03:04:19.453]  And that's coming here, too.
[03:04:19.453 --> 03:04:22.876]  Yeah, that was in the news this weekend, and they announce it like it's good!
[03:04:22.876 --> 03:04:23.456]  That's right.
[03:04:23.456 --> 03:04:24.857]  And the bill in the U.S.
[03:04:24.857 --> 03:04:34.224]  to do with agriculture, etc., will affect the home gardener, and there's a clause in there, too, it says, and all food preparation facilities, that includes your kitchen, folks.
[03:04:35.023 --> 03:04:39.705]  Oh no, in fact they've had committee hearings, and the bill says everything.
[03:04:39.705 --> 03:04:49.130]  A tomato plant folks, they say they will use SWAT teams, and notice they're already beta testing SWAT teaming people selling eggs on the road, selling watermelons.
[03:04:49.130 --> 03:04:50.650]  I mean, that's what Stalin did.
[03:04:50.650 --> 03:04:53.492]  Stay there Alan, let's continue with what their real agenda is.
[03:04:53.492 --> 03:04:54.892]  And folks, phone calls coming up, 1-800-259-9231.
[03:04:54.892 --> 03:04:56.813]  My websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[03:05:02.054 --> 03:05:08.001]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[03:05:08.001 --> 03:05:12.787]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[03:05:12.787 --> 03:05:18.213]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[03:05:18.213 --> 03:05:21.657]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[03:05:22.137 --> 03:05:30.642]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[03:05:30.642 --> 03:05:36.445]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[03:05:36.445 --> 03:05:42.428]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:05:42.428 --> 03:05:44.749]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[03:05:45.089 --> 03:05:46.889]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[03:06:05.399 --> 03:06:08.022]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:06:08.022 --> 03:06:15.010]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:06:15.589 --> 03:06:22.174]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:22.174 --> 03:06:24.156]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:24.156 --> 03:06:26.658]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:06:26.658 --> 03:06:37.567]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:06:38.237 --> 03:06:39.898]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:39.898 --> 03:06:41.759]  It's about a one world government.
[03:06:41.759 --> 03:06:48.661]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:06:56.925 --> 03:06:58.505]  The Obama Deception.
[03:06:58.505 --> 03:06:59.706]  The people strike back.
[03:07:01.960 --> 03:07:05.483]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:07:05.483 --> 03:07:10.887]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:07:10.887 --> 03:07:16.052]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:07:16.052 --> 03:07:27.181]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[03:07:27.561 --> 03:07:33.346]  The KDF Dual Medias Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:07:33.346 --> 03:07:39.611]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:07:39.611 --> 03:07:40.652]  What about you?
[03:07:40.652 --> 03:07:42.573]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.

[03:08:01.968 --> 03:08:07.371]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:07.371 --> 03:08:10.574]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:10.574 --> 03:08:20.701]  You know, Michael Savage came out two weeks ago and said that he believes Obama's controllers will stage Reichstag terror attacks in the United States to bring in martial law.
[03:08:22.281 --> 03:08:23.061]  That's a big deal.
[03:08:23.061 --> 03:08:36.905]  I was picking some food up last night on the way home and ran into two folks there at the bar where I was getting the food who were listeners of this show and Savage and they had heard that and that really shocked them.
[03:08:36.905 --> 03:08:41.686]  We have the Army Zone manuals where they teach Army Captains how to stage terror attacks.
[03:08:41.686 --> 03:08:45.368]  I mean this is as much a part of their daily operation as
[03:08:48.675 --> 03:08:49.258]  Anything.
[03:08:49.258 --> 03:08:52.651]  I mean, as their canteen, as their M16.
[03:08:52.651 --> 03:08:53.856]  Remember, the Global is Stage 9-11.
[03:08:55.626 --> 03:08:58.648]  And they killed a million 300,000 Iraqis.
[03:08:58.648 --> 03:09:02.692]  Brzezinski in two books, one he published last year, brags that the U.S.
[03:09:02.692 --> 03:09:08.876]  funded the Khmer Rouge in Pol Pot that killed 35% of their population, 3 million people.
[03:09:08.876 --> 03:09:10.458]  They don't care about you either.
[03:09:10.458 --> 03:09:11.238]  You understand that?
[03:09:11.238 --> 03:09:17.423]  Your little world, my little world, having things that are nice, having liberty, being treated with respect by the government, it's all over.
[03:09:17.423 --> 03:09:19.845]  They're not doing the slow socialist move anymore.
[03:09:19.845 --> 03:09:23.028]  That was to get us domesticated, to get us bankrupt, to get us under their control.
[03:09:23.028 --> 03:09:24.489]  They're moving with a hot war now.
[03:09:25.572 --> 03:09:29.589]  So instead of the amount of changes you'd see in 30-40 years, you'll now see in a year.
[03:09:32.179 --> 03:09:36.721]  They're making their big move, folks, and they're going to take your pension funds and everything you've got.
[03:09:36.721 --> 03:09:41.444]  Millions will end up serving them and being their minions for a paltry sum.
[03:09:41.444 --> 03:09:46.026]  This is like the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany or Mao Zedong's China.
[03:09:46.026 --> 03:09:54.390]  In fact, if you really study what Obama's doing, it's more akin to the refining of the Stalinist era with the Maoist era.
[03:09:54.390 --> 03:09:56.371]  And that's what he's setting up, these youth brigades.
[03:09:56.371 --> 03:09:57.692]  I mean, this is happening.
[03:09:57.692 --> 03:10:01.374]  They passed the draft, which is an expansive draft,
[03:10:02.419 --> 03:10:11.464]  Making middle school students work for the feds, high school, 18-24 serving in a new domestic military that will also be deployed overseas.
[03:10:11.464 --> 03:10:15.767]  And these idiots signing up for Obama's system, they don't know they're about to be conscripted.
[03:10:15.767 --> 03:10:20.590]  But he's also going to have his separate, outside the government army.
[03:10:20.590 --> 03:10:25.773]  And, Alan Watt, I mean, you brought up the fact that they're accelerating everything right now, and this is a blitzkrieg.
[03:10:27.071 --> 03:10:28.592]  I want that to really sink into listeners.
[03:10:28.592 --> 03:10:35.114]  Can you speak to that more and then get into the type of plant society, shutting down the gardens, everything you talked about?
[03:10:35.114 --> 03:10:35.814]  Yes.
[03:10:35.814 --> 03:10:49.058]  In fact, it was a politician in Holland that a couple of years ago said that this new order basically is like a big ship in a rough sea and every country is on board with this direction of the ship.
[03:10:50.120 --> 03:10:55.106]  And all kinds, all kinds of countries from third world to first world countries are all on board the ship.
[03:10:55.106 --> 03:11:02.134]  And whereas before, the third world countries were down below decks, now everybody's on top of the deck, mixed together.
[03:11:02.134 --> 03:11:05.938]  And the captains of the ship have to keep on course with where they're going.
[03:11:05.938 --> 03:11:09.382]  This is the terminology that's used with the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:11:10.128 --> 03:11:10.448]  We're good to go.
[03:11:23.260 --> 03:11:24.701]  Service, service.
[03:11:24.701 --> 03:11:32.886]  And gradually, through the warfare and all the rest of it, they're introducing service, perpetual, lifelong service to this world state.
[03:11:32.886 --> 03:11:37.349]  That will be your purpose for living, in fact, will be to serve the world state.
[03:11:37.349 --> 03:11:40.271]  And that's why they're going ahead now with this.
[03:11:40.271 --> 03:11:46.775]  They will grab many people who have been outspoken about this, to make examples of them, to make sure the rest of them get it.
[03:11:46.775 --> 03:11:52.299]  They'll give them incredible sentences to make sure it terrifies everyone, just as it did in the Soviet Union.
[03:11:52.899 --> 03:11:54.540]  And we can't allow that to happen.
[03:11:54.540 --> 03:12:05.027]  We've got to speak up now because once it's happening, once they start raiding your streets and grabbing your neighbours and hauling them off in front of the whole street, they turn out the whole street to witness it.
[03:12:05.027 --> 03:12:12.232]  You'll end up like the Soviets where you'll be ashamed of yourself because secretly you're glad they took your neighbours and not yourself.
[03:12:12.232 --> 03:12:15.975]  That's the state you end up being in under fear and tyranny.
[03:12:15.975 --> 03:12:17.996]  And we cannot allow this to happen.
[03:12:17.996 --> 03:12:20.358]  It must not even start to happen.
[03:12:23.018 --> 03:12:24.059]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[03:12:24.059 --> 03:12:33.007]  You know, I'm just looking at Infowars.com headlines, and it says, Department of Homeland Security investigating large ammunition purchases.
[03:12:33.007 --> 03:12:36.270]  So now Homeland Security was supposedly going to fight Al-Qaeda?
[03:12:36.270 --> 03:12:38.812]  It is now looking at who's been ordering lots of ammo.
[03:12:38.812 --> 03:12:47.720]  So if you stockpile it or think it's a good investment to sell later, they're now saying that the owner of Namek's Sport Shop and Farm and Garden Center in
[03:12:48.681 --> 03:13:04.631]  Warrensburg said gun sales at his business began to increase, and then it goes on to say that Homeland Security is there now trying to track who's buying ammo, and then all over the country, the feds are saying if you want your stimulus package money in your county, you gotta pass a law to register people when they buy ammo.
[03:13:06.172 --> 03:13:18.054]  Then I have another article here from the Council on Foreign Relations where General James Jones, one of the heads of the National Security Council, says, I take my orders from Henry Kissinger, who's not even part of the government.
[03:13:18.054 --> 03:13:25.316]  Notice who was the Chief Advisor to the Vatican, Chief Advisor to Bush Sr., Chief Advisor to Clinton, Chief Advisor to Nixon.
[03:13:25.316 --> 03:13:31.597]  I mean, how can these Obama people think there's any difference when it's right out in the open that the same people are running the show?
[03:13:32.714 --> 03:13:33.515]  I know, and they are.
[03:13:33.515 --> 03:13:39.163]  Again, let's go back to the Council on Foreign Relations and what Professor Carl Quigley said.
[03:13:39.163 --> 03:13:47.175]  He said, the world is now run by technocrats, unelected people who are in contact with all the leaders, the elected leaders.
[03:13:48.044 --> 03:14:00.152]  And he said that these technocrats go behind the scenes, do all the real work, they have the real power, they're not responsible to the public, but they basically advise all the presidents and prime ministers what to do.
[03:14:00.152 --> 03:14:02.194]  And that's a fact, that's what we truly have.
[03:14:02.194 --> 03:14:08.638]  And I've got the same article with him saying that he gets his orders from Kissinger, you're quite right.
[03:14:08.638 --> 03:14:11.080]  And that's from... And Brzezinski too, yeah.
[03:14:11.080 --> 03:14:14.042]  Yeah, that's from the Council on Foreign Relations bragging
[03:14:15.376 --> 03:14:17.458]  Just absolutely no change with Obama.
[03:14:17.458 --> 03:14:17.798]  Look at this.
[03:14:17.798 --> 03:14:21.741]  Department of Homeland Security investigating large ammunition purchases.
[03:14:21.741 --> 03:14:22.341]  Here's another one.
[03:14:22.341 --> 03:14:23.182]  Video.
[03:14:23.182 --> 03:14:25.543]  Obama supporters go door-to-door.
[03:14:25.543 --> 03:14:26.584]  Guys, pull that up.
[03:14:26.584 --> 03:14:33.569]  It's the third story that comes up in the little news box right there.
[03:14:33.569 --> 03:14:34.289]  Here's another one.
[03:14:34.289 --> 03:14:39.593]  CERB death leader squad commander, CIA operative.
[03:14:39.593 --> 03:14:42.255]  Man, I tell you, this is just... And he worked for 20 years.
[03:14:42.255 --> 03:14:44.497]  He was the top double agent for 20 years, yeah?
[03:14:46.787 --> 03:14:47.487]  Absolutely.
[03:14:47.487 --> 03:14:49.088]  And when they were ready to betray him, they did.
[03:14:49.088 --> 03:14:53.789]  That's all these people do.
[03:14:53.789 --> 03:14:54.870]  This is incredible.
[03:14:54.870 --> 03:14:58.011]  Just continue, Alan.
[03:14:58.011 --> 03:15:01.552]  I always tell young people, regardless of the ethnic background that you're in,
[03:15:02.219 --> 03:15:08.008]  Don't join groups that are advocating violence because you're being set up as patsies.
[03:15:08.008 --> 03:15:13.276]  They've got to now bring forth terrorism, maybe on a continual basis.
[03:15:13.276 --> 03:15:16.862]  So we're so used to hearing something getting blown up this week or next week or whatever.
[03:15:17.652 --> 03:15:18.433]  I don't think so.
[03:15:34.076 --> 03:15:36.137]  This is out of the post star.
[03:15:36.137 --> 03:15:38.999]  They're now saying you may be a terrorist if you buy a bunch of ammo.
[03:15:38.999 --> 03:15:41.441]  So again, they're scared of folks buying lots of ammo.
[03:15:41.441 --> 03:15:46.544]  So they're saying, OK, we're going to put you on terror list if you do this as an attempt at a chilling effect.
[03:15:46.544 --> 03:15:47.744]  I don't see this working.
[03:15:47.744 --> 03:15:50.786]  I see this accelerating gun and ammo sales.
[03:15:50.786 --> 03:15:51.747]  It probably will.
[03:15:51.747 --> 03:15:52.487]  It probably will.
[03:15:52.487 --> 03:15:57.050]  If people have the sense not to be intimidated, you either keep your way of living.
[03:15:58.035 --> 03:15:58.976]  Or you give it up.
[03:15:58.976 --> 03:15:59.917]  It's as simple as that.
[03:15:59.917 --> 03:16:02.659]  You keep your way of living or give it up and comply.
[03:16:02.659 --> 03:16:04.760]  And if you comply, you're defeated.
[03:16:04.760 --> 03:16:06.181]  I was about to say, exactly.
[03:16:06.181 --> 03:16:07.422]  If you comply, you're defeated.
[03:16:07.422 --> 03:16:09.544]  I was about to echo that.
[03:16:09.544 --> 03:16:11.005]  We must say no.
[03:16:11.005 --> 03:16:13.206]  We're not doing anything wrong protesting the Federal Reserve.
[03:16:13.206 --> 03:16:15.668]  We're not doing anything wrong buying lots of ammo.
[03:16:15.668 --> 03:16:16.669]  You are the criminals.
[03:16:16.669 --> 03:16:19.791]  I mean, the criminals don't want us armed, Alan.
[03:16:19.791 --> 03:16:20.152]  Go ahead.
[03:16:20.652 --> 03:16:30.377]  Well, that's obvious, but it's been stated many times over the past that you have to disarm the American people to fulfill their agenda.
[03:16:30.377 --> 03:16:31.558]  And that is true.
[03:16:31.558 --> 03:16:42.024]  I mean, even if the people are not organized, as I say, towards the end, if this goes ahead and steamrolls ahead, you are going to see famine because five agribusinesses control all the food.
[03:16:42.024 --> 03:16:43.765]  They won't allow you to grow your own.
[03:16:44.452 --> 03:16:44.853]  Listen to this!
[03:17:04.816 --> 03:17:10.480]  One northern Warren County resident found out recently the government is paying attention to such ammo sales.
[03:17:10.480 --> 03:17:16.784]  Wes said a customer of his recently stocked up on .223 caliber rounds, a caliber often used in assault weapons.
[03:17:16.784 --> 03:17:22.108]  The customer brought 1,000 rounds of ammo, I've done that, a few months ago through a mail order company.
[03:17:22.108 --> 03:17:24.189]  Shortly after the purchase, he received a visit from the U.S.
[03:17:24.189 --> 03:17:30.393]  Department of Homeland Security, whose interest was apparently connected by a large sale purchase of the caliber.
[03:17:30.393 --> 03:17:31.254]  His wife was home,
[03:17:31.934 --> 03:17:32.914]  He was at church.
[03:17:32.914 --> 03:17:34.375]  People are buying a lot of ammo.
[03:17:34.375 --> 03:17:36.556]  And so they just throw that in there.
[03:17:36.556 --> 03:17:37.476]  Mm-hmm.
[03:17:37.476 --> 03:17:38.616]  That's right.
[03:17:38.616 --> 03:17:45.378]  So what was normal at one time, I know a lot of guys in the States would go out to the ranges there and just blast off a whole case at times.
[03:17:45.378 --> 03:17:48.099]  Spend the whole day at a... Well, that's how you buy them cheaper.
[03:17:48.099 --> 03:17:49.760]  That's how you buy them cheaper, yeah.
[03:17:49.760 --> 03:17:50.480]  That's right.
[03:17:50.480 --> 03:17:53.781]  And so again, that was the usual way of living.
[03:17:53.781 --> 03:17:55.882]  And they want you to change it all.
[03:17:55.882 --> 03:17:58.003]  To suit them for what's coming down the pike.
[03:17:58.003 --> 03:17:59.043]  That's so obvious, yeah.
[03:17:59.503 --> 03:18:07.665]  Well, I mean, they've built this giant Homeland Security apparatus, took it over, said the Congress runs nothing, the Federal Reserve goes on TV and Congress says, we run everything, you can't question us.
[03:18:07.665 --> 03:18:19.187]  They openly announced their tyranny in plain view, like it's no big deal to set the precedent, and then they announced the Army, the police, Homeland Security, we're watching gun owners, we're watching all of you, you're terrorists, and they tell the cops, these gun owners want to kill you.
[03:18:19.187 --> 03:18:20.828]  I mean, that's in the MIAC report.
[03:18:20.828 --> 03:18:22.588]  These gun owners want to murder officers.
[03:18:23.308 --> 03:18:31.232]  And then they're going to send the cops out for the guns, and they're going to get killed, which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and the cops won't think, well, why is this happening to me?
[03:18:31.232 --> 03:18:31.812]  That's correct.
[03:18:31.812 --> 03:18:40.236]  But unfortunately, too, I've got a generation growing up playing video games who want to wear those black uniforms, and they want to go and kill people.
[03:18:40.236 --> 03:18:42.298]  I mean, these people really do exist.
[03:18:42.298 --> 03:18:45.119]  They're brainwashed to be gung-ho killers.
[03:18:46.082 --> 03:18:48.543]  And so, this has been a long-term preparation.
[03:18:48.543 --> 03:18:49.464]  We've got to understand that.
[03:18:49.464 --> 03:18:53.365]  This isn't just happening now, and it's all disassociated.
[03:18:53.365 --> 03:18:55.166]  This has been long-term planning.
[03:18:55.166 --> 03:19:03.990]  That's why they created one generation to grow up, be in their twenties, join the black-clad outfit guys, the ninjas, and they're rusting for blood.
[03:19:03.990 --> 03:19:08.111]  It's like getting to take part in a real video game and really kill people.
[03:19:08.111 --> 03:19:09.332]  That's high on their agenda.
[03:19:10.632 --> 03:19:13.914]  Well, I've found the main programming TV show is G.I.
[03:19:13.914 --> 03:19:14.214]  Joe.
[03:19:14.214 --> 03:19:16.835]  In fact, I think I sent a clip this weekend to the network.
[03:19:16.835 --> 03:19:24.358]  John, do you have the clip where Cobra Commander is explaining that they've created a worldwide economic collapse to bring in the New World Order?
[03:19:24.358 --> 03:19:28.280]  Do you have that clip I sent over the weekend?
[03:19:28.280 --> 03:19:29.761]  Yeah, we're going to come back and play that.
[03:19:29.761 --> 03:19:36.204]  And then, guys, did you go find the CNN report showing the Obama people knocking on people's doors, telling them to join the Obama Nation?
[03:19:37.608 --> 03:19:39.789]  That's the third story at Infowars.com.
[03:19:39.789 --> 03:19:40.710]  We need to get that ready.
[03:19:40.710 --> 03:19:45.092]  I'm going to play a clip of that or we can just play the video in the background as we talk with Alan Watt.
[03:19:45.092 --> 03:19:49.995]  At the bottom of the hour, we're going to start going to your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[03:19:49.995 --> 03:19:51.356]  I could just talk to Alan Watt forever.
[03:19:51.356 --> 03:19:54.958]  This guy is 100% spot on and he's a great colleague to work with.
[03:19:54.958 --> 03:19:56.259]  I really appreciate him.
[03:19:56.259 --> 03:19:58.360]  CutIntoTheMatrix.com is the website.
[03:19:58.360 --> 03:19:58.780]  Stay with us.
[03:20:02.012 --> 03:20:05.454]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[03:20:05.454 --> 03:20:09.716]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[03:20:09.716 --> 03:20:17.681]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[03:20:17.961 --> 03:20:18.381]  We're good to go!
[03:20:50.563 --> 03:20:51.444]  We're good to go.
[03:21:08.443 --> 03:21:14.325]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:14.325 --> 03:21:20.808]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:20.808 --> 03:21:22.789]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:22.789 --> 03:21:25.250]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:25.250 --> 03:21:36.094]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:21:38.422 --> 03:21:40.102]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:40.102 --> 03:21:41.963]  It's about a one world government.
[03:21:41.963 --> 03:21:48.864]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:21:48.864 --> 03:21:57.126]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:57.126 --> 03:21:58.707]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.707 --> 03:21:59.887]  The people strike back.
[03:22:02.062 --> 03:22:04.165]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[03:22:04.165 --> 03:22:04.485]  March 23rd, 2009.
[03:22:04.485 --> 03:22:05.487]  Gold opened this morning at $9.5050.
[03:22:05.487 --> 03:22:08.390]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.7767, $4.8884 for the half-ounce, and $2.4442 for a quarter-ounce.
[03:22:08.390 --> 03:22:08.791]  That's $9.7767, $4.8884, or $2.4442.
[03:22:20.962 --> 03:22:24.643]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[03:22:24.643 --> 03:22:27.745]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[03:22:27.745 --> 03:22:37.228]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[03:22:37.228 --> 03:22:42.550]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[03:22:43.050 --> 03:22:45.391]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[03:22:45.391 --> 03:22:48.252]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[03:22:48.252 --> 03:22:51.614]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[03:22:51.614 --> 03:22:55.396]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[03:22:55.396 --> 03:22:55.696]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:55.696 --> 03:22:55.876]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:01.857 --> 03:23:03.157]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:23:03.157 --> 03:23:08.739]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:23:08.739 --> 03:23:13.760]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:23:13.760 --> 03:23:19.342]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:23:19.342 --> 03:23:24.563]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:23:24.563 --> 03:23:31.405]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:23:31.673 --> 03:23:32.793]  And here's the best part.
[03:23:32.793 --> 03:23:35.554]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:23:35.554 --> 03:23:39.476]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:23:39.476 --> 03:23:42.677]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:23:42.677 --> 03:23:44.878]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:23:44.878 --> 03:23:45.778]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:23:45.778 --> 03:23:46.018]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:23:46.018 --> 03:23:49.480]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:23:49.480 --> 03:23:51.200]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:24:04.232 --> 03:24:06.473]  There's too much news to cover, folks.
[03:24:06.473 --> 03:24:14.697]  I may do 15-20 minutes of overdrive and see if Alan Watt will do that with us today on PrisonPlanet.tv and the InfoWars streams.
[03:24:14.697 --> 03:24:17.959]  Because it looks like we're going to have the Department of the Army come on the show.
[03:24:17.959 --> 03:24:26.163]  We've called four numbers, gotten a bunch of other numbers, and we've gotten a colonel who says in 15 minutes he may come on.
[03:24:26.163 --> 03:24:27.883]  Alan will be on with us for that.
[03:24:27.883 --> 03:24:32.706]  Dealing with the Secret Army Police, watching myself and others at the end of the Fed demonstration in Dallas.
[03:24:35.242 --> 03:24:39.724]  This just in, the UK population must fall to 30 million, says Porritt.
[03:24:39.724 --> 03:24:45.266]  Jonathan Porritt of Gordon Brown's Leading Green Advisors is to warn that Britain must drastically reduce its population.
[03:24:45.266 --> 03:24:48.748]  It doesn't matter if the British population only has 1.5 children.
[03:24:48.748 --> 03:24:51.489]  For every two people, they don't even replace them.
[03:24:51.489 --> 03:24:53.270]  The average in Europe's 1.3.
[03:24:53.270 --> 03:24:55.470]  Europe's dying, Japan's dying.
[03:24:55.470 --> 03:24:59.092]  The population's going to plane off at 8 billion, the third world's still exploding.
[03:24:59.092 --> 03:25:00.152]  This is the eugenicist.
[03:25:00.152 --> 03:25:01.073]  Times of London.
[03:25:02.216 --> 03:25:04.036]  There you go, right there, my friend.
[03:25:04.036 --> 03:25:13.598]  They say they're bringing in big government so they can basically, with water rationing and food rationing, make people so poor they can't afford to have children and a one-child policy.
[03:25:13.598 --> 03:25:15.719]  Alan, what?
[03:25:15.719 --> 03:25:27.962]  That was gone through by Charles Galton Darwin in the 50s when he published his book, The Next Million Years, on behalf, and by the way, he has a society still going, a eugenic society.
[03:25:27.962 --> 03:25:30.022]  They call themselves the British Eugenic Society.
[03:25:30.760 --> 03:25:44.665]  Initially they said we can tempt them to go after the material goods of an age of plenty, but eventually he said that would be too hard on resources, so they'd have to do it the other way around and basically, as you say, bring them into poverty.
[03:25:44.665 --> 03:25:46.466]  This was planned 50 years ago.
[03:25:46.466 --> 03:25:47.586]  Now that's a cut of 50%!
[03:25:47.586 --> 03:25:47.746]  Yes.
[03:25:51.004 --> 03:25:52.325]  And it won't stop there, mind you.
[03:25:52.325 --> 03:25:54.527]  That's just to get up the bottle rolling.
[03:25:54.527 --> 03:25:58.530]  Because they want to really bring down the population of the planet.
[03:25:58.530 --> 03:25:59.171]  Almost 90%, really.
[03:25:59.171 --> 03:26:01.753]  Yeah, I've always seen their documents.
[03:26:01.753 --> 03:26:04.896]  For the public, they always say 50%.
[03:26:04.896 --> 03:26:08.018]  In their mainline documents, they say 80%.
[03:26:08.018 --> 03:26:13.263]  And then in their internal documents that we've gotten, they say 99% of us will be exterminated.
[03:26:13.263 --> 03:26:13.983]  That's right.
[03:26:13.983 --> 03:26:17.226]  And plus, you have the military think tanks for Britain.
[03:26:17.865 --> 03:26:26.131]  And the US, both on board with the depopulation agenda, so they have eugenics in the military's teachings at the higher level.
[03:26:26.890 --> 03:26:29.311]  So this is a must-be on your behalf.
[03:26:29.311 --> 03:26:31.851]  There's nothing happenstance about it.
[03:26:31.851 --> 03:26:32.851]  It's all related.
[03:26:32.851 --> 03:26:38.053]  It's all... What we have is a pyramid with a capstone running the whole kit and caboodle underneath it.
[03:26:38.053 --> 03:26:39.113]  That's what we have.
[03:26:39.113 --> 03:26:44.454]  And that's why they give the troops the delayed cancer virus injections that kill them by age 55 to 60.
[03:26:44.454 --> 03:26:48.115]  That's even come out in documents and the higher-ups say, well, we've got to kill the troops.
[03:26:48.115 --> 03:26:50.515]  You know, we don't have to pay for them when they get old.
[03:26:50.515 --> 03:26:52.896]  This is the socialist model.
[03:26:53.616 --> 03:26:55.117]  And now they've just got us conditioned.
[03:26:55.117 --> 03:26:59.078]  Yeah, HPV shots killing people and the bird flu vaccines killing people.
[03:26:59.078 --> 03:27:00.538]  And they just get us kind of normalized.
[03:27:00.538 --> 03:27:03.599]  Well, yeah, we make you take the shot and then you die or get paralyzed.
[03:27:03.599 --> 03:27:06.040]  And it's kind of like, you're not an extremist, are you?
[03:27:06.040 --> 03:27:07.280]  Take the shot and die.
[03:27:07.280 --> 03:27:07.960]  We love you.
[03:27:07.960 --> 03:27:09.161]  It's for your safety.
[03:27:09.161 --> 03:27:12.962]  I mean, again, it's just total normalization of insanity.
[03:27:13.903 --> 03:27:14.203]  It is.
[03:27:14.203 --> 03:27:15.324]  That's how it works.
[03:27:15.324 --> 03:27:16.984]  It's insidious to begin with.
[03:27:16.984 --> 03:27:17.845]  It's long-term.
[03:27:17.845 --> 03:27:19.646]  A lot is done in secret.
[03:27:19.646 --> 03:27:27.109]  The sterilization of males has been going on in the Western world for 50 years, and all the medical societies now come out and admit it.
[03:27:27.109 --> 03:27:31.091]  They've known this for 50... It suddenly started about 50 years ago, suddenly.
[03:27:31.955 --> 03:27:32.876]  I don't
[03:27:50.809 --> 03:27:52.950]  There's hundreds of different combos of cheap plastic.
[03:27:52.950 --> 03:27:57.913]  They chose the one formula 60 years ago for universal adoption.
[03:27:57.913 --> 03:28:03.336]  The one type that leaches the exact estrogen mimicker that sterilizes men.
[03:28:03.336 --> 03:28:09.920]  And they also made sure that all baby formulas were rinsed to sterilize it supposedly with the same formula.
[03:28:09.920 --> 03:28:11.681]  So they hit them right at birth.
[03:28:11.681 --> 03:28:17.544]  And then we expose it's killing the kids in thousands, mainstream news, and they say, we decided melamine's good for babies.
[03:28:18.482 --> 03:28:22.684]  Yes, and it was put out by the Melamine Society that works with the European Union.
[03:28:22.684 --> 03:28:28.428]  Every study they put out comes from the society that owns the companies that put it in the food.
[03:28:28.428 --> 03:28:33.410]  So, you wonder why you're dying of cancer, why your kids are sterile or retarded, and you just still love the government.
[03:28:33.410 --> 03:28:35.292]  You'll line up at your Obama Brigades.
[03:28:35.292 --> 03:28:36.632]  Let's play this Cobra Commander clip.
[03:28:36.632 --> 03:28:37.493]  I'm just going to play the audio.
[03:28:37.493 --> 03:28:42.095]  We have the video, but here is Cobra Commander, and then we'll come back and play a clip of the CNN and go to your calls.
[03:28:42.095 --> 03:28:44.797]  Here it is.
[03:28:44.797 --> 03:28:46.378]  John, go ahead and play the Cobra Commander, please.
[03:28:47.791 --> 03:28:51.094]  Attention citizens!
[03:28:51.094 --> 03:29:05.406]  Due to the financial irresponsibility and incompetence of your leaders, Cobra has found it necessary to restructure your nation's economy.
[03:29:05.406 --> 03:29:15.354]  We have begun by eliminating the worthless green paper which your government has distilled into the street is valuable.
[03:29:16.431 --> 03:29:19.593]  Cobra will come to your rescue!
[03:29:19.593 --> 03:29:24.656]  And out of the ashes will arrive a new mother!
[03:29:26.137 --> 03:29:28.438]  It is in the United States.
[03:29:28.438 --> 03:29:33.780]  I am pleased to announce Cobra's economic recovery plan.
[03:29:33.780 --> 03:29:44.343]  If you want money to buy food for your children, take all your valuables to the nearest branch of extensive enterprises.
[03:29:44.343 --> 03:29:52.166]  There, all goods will be exchanged for Cobra currency!
[03:29:52.166 --> 03:29:53.566]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.566 --> 03:29:55.087]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.099 --> 03:30:02.204]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.204 --> 03:30:03.566]  Hello, this is Steve Shank.
[03:30:03.566 --> 03:30:05.968]  Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food.
[03:30:05.968 --> 03:30:10.131]  But Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food.
[03:30:10.131 --> 03:30:12.173]  If you're a politician who voted for the bailout,
[03:30:16.766 --> 03:30:17.006]  We're good.
[03:30:47.083 --> 03:30:50.485]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:30:50.485 --> 03:30:55.548]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:31:15.726 --> 03:31:22.309]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:22.309 --> 03:31:24.289]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:24.289 --> 03:31:26.790]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:31:26.790 --> 03:31:37.755]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:31:38.377 --> 03:31:40.037]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:40.037 --> 03:31:41.898]  It's about a one world government.
[03:31:41.898 --> 03:31:48.799]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:31:48.799 --> 03:31:57.061]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:31:57.061 --> 03:31:58.642]  The Obama Deception.
[03:31:58.642 --> 03:31:59.822]  The people strike back.
[03:32:02.062 --> 03:32:03.003]  Detoxify.
[03:32:03.003 --> 03:32:07.606]  You are constantly reminded how important detoxify is to cleanse your body of dangerous toxins.
[03:32:07.606 --> 03:32:13.590]  You are also being reminded that it's important to detoxify safely and not all products will provide safe and effective results.
[03:32:13.590 --> 03:32:17.312]  It's time to clear the air and clear your body with safe and effective Keelermat.
[03:32:17.492 --> 03:32:22.614]  With the help of Nutri-A-Dine, Keeler Max will help your body to remove heavy metals, toxins, and chemicals.
[03:32:22.614 --> 03:32:28.317]  The liquid zeolite formula, Humic, helps to remove chemicals, toxins, and fluoride, bromine, and chloride.
[03:32:28.317 --> 03:32:32.338]  Add Malignant Block to stimulate phase 2 detox and anti-cancer protection.
[03:32:32.338 --> 03:32:37.120]  Green Tea Supreme to bind ionic toxins and protecting DNA and membranes.
[03:32:37.120 --> 03:32:43.783]  And Nutri-Trala to recycle all fat and water-soluble antioxidant cellular protection enzymes and molecules.
[03:32:43.783 --> 03:32:46.024]  Keeler Max and Dr. Bill's Oral Detox.
[03:32:46.164 --> 03:32:46.324]  I think.
[03:33:04.522 --> 03:33:06.723]  I've been busy working behind the scenes.
[03:33:06.723 --> 03:33:08.524]  I forgot to ask Alan Watt during the break.
[03:33:08.524 --> 03:33:09.664]  I'll put him on the spot here on air.
[03:33:09.664 --> 03:33:10.205]  I know he's busy.
[03:33:10.205 --> 03:33:10.685]  He can't do it.
[03:33:10.685 --> 03:33:11.625]  That's fine.
[03:33:11.625 --> 03:33:18.408]  Alan, can you go into overdrive so we have time to take calls and cover other issues 20 minutes into the next hour, or do you need to leave us at the end of this hour?
[03:33:18.408 --> 03:33:20.429]  No, I can go on.
[03:33:20.429 --> 03:33:21.870]  Alright, you're just awesome.
[03:33:21.870 --> 03:33:23.170]  CutIntoTheMatrix.com.
[03:33:23.170 --> 03:33:24.371]  Our site's InfoWars.com.
[03:33:24.371 --> 03:33:26.092]  Okay, this is why we're busy.
[03:33:27.210 --> 03:33:29.772]  I sent the numbers to John Harmon of the military.
[03:33:29.772 --> 03:33:35.676]  I wasn't clear during the break before last and I said, we're going to call this guy live on air.
[03:33:35.676 --> 03:33:36.877]  The message got mixed up.
[03:33:36.877 --> 03:33:42.320]  So John, because we've been calling all day and they've been refusing to come on or giving us other numbers.
[03:33:42.320 --> 03:33:51.386]  John Harmon got a hold of them, brought up the army document saying basically, you know, that they had to watch the in the Fed Ron Paul demonstrators as potential terrorists.
[03:33:51.386 --> 03:33:53.528]  And he confirmed the document.
[03:33:53.528 --> 03:33:56.690]  Also Rob Deuce talked to him, but they don't want to talk about it on air.
[03:33:57.470 --> 03:33:58.970]  Uh, but there it is confirmed.
[03:33:58.970 --> 03:34:00.131]  John Harmon, I want to bring you up.
[03:34:00.131 --> 03:34:02.211]  You talked to this guy.
[03:34:02.211 --> 03:34:03.371]  Let's just go ahead and give his name out.
[03:34:03.371 --> 03:34:05.752]  It's Scott Ferguson, Department of Public Affairs, U.S.
[03:34:05.752 --> 03:34:06.892]  Army.
[03:34:06.892 --> 03:34:07.792]  Uh, he's a civilian.
[03:34:07.792 --> 03:34:09.293]  We talked to a colonel earlier, too.
[03:34:09.293 --> 03:34:11.033]  John, what did he say to you?
[03:34:11.033 --> 03:34:15.734]  Well, basically, I talked to him about 15 minutes ago, and he was really arrogant sounding.
[03:34:15.734 --> 03:34:17.854]  Just did not want to come on air.
[03:34:17.854 --> 03:34:19.335]  Didn't know anything.
[03:34:19.335 --> 03:34:20.815]  You know, didn't want to talk politics.
[03:34:21.810 --> 03:34:23.270]  Was just really short with me.
[03:34:23.270 --> 03:34:26.891]  And I said, well, you know, could I call you back in about 15 minutes, see if you could come on?
[03:34:26.891 --> 03:34:28.732]  Yep, sounds fine.
[03:34:28.732 --> 03:34:30.452]  Called him back, no answer.
[03:34:30.452 --> 03:34:31.973]  Now he's not answering.
[03:34:31.973 --> 03:34:34.693]  Now, I was talking to you and Rob Due during the break.
[03:34:34.693 --> 03:34:38.794]  One of you said that you did talk to him and a colonel specifically.
[03:34:38.794 --> 03:34:40.094]  It was Rob Due, actually.
[03:34:40.094 --> 03:34:44.996]  Did you bring up the Army report to him and say that was what it was about?
[03:34:44.996 --> 03:34:50.397]  No, I just asked him, hey, we would like someone associated with what you do and get your opinion on what's going on.
[03:34:51.055 --> 03:34:53.657]  He was just still kind of like, oh, I don't know.
[03:34:53.657 --> 03:34:54.457]  That's not what we do.
[03:34:54.457 --> 03:34:55.818]  You know this is the Army, right?
[03:34:55.818 --> 03:34:57.739]  I was like, yeah, yeah.
[03:34:57.739 --> 03:35:03.403]  Yeah, well, Dew did bring up the report, and they said the same thing about politics.
[03:35:03.403 --> 03:35:06.865]  So we'll continue to track this as it develops.
[03:35:06.865 --> 03:35:09.287]  But just getting crazy.
[03:35:09.287 --> 03:35:17.912]  Now, I had sent to the network this weekend, because I'm still in the mindset of not doing video, just doing audio, to play the clip for me this week of G.I.
[03:35:17.912 --> 03:35:19.353]  Joe.
[03:35:19.353 --> 03:35:19.553]  In the 80s,
[03:35:20.934 --> 03:35:26.239]  I was kind of at the end of watching cartoons, you know, as a teenager by the early 80s, but I remember when G.I.
[03:35:26.239 --> 03:35:32.286]  Joe first came on in about 82, and this is from one of the early episodes, that was all New World Order propaganda.
[03:35:32.286 --> 03:35:38.131]  And since then I'll go and watch online, and others are doing it too, old Cobra Commander, you know, episodes of G.I.
[03:35:38.131 --> 03:35:39.173]  Joe, and it's all
[03:35:41.147 --> 03:35:54.714]  Basically throwing the New World Order in your face in every episode, like the TV's mind-controlling people, but Cobra Commander's doing it, and it's got to be stopped, and it admits the wavelength of the video, mesmerizes you, which Significant Reports admit.
[03:35:54.714 --> 03:36:02.137]  In this one, he's for gold coins, and he's manipulated the market to crash the world economy and to sell everybody gold.
[03:36:02.137 --> 03:36:02.837]  And he's bad.
[03:36:02.837 --> 03:36:07.760]  Gold is bad, cash is good, and he holds up a gold coin and goes, ah, Cobra money!
[03:36:08.180 --> 03:36:12.563]  So let's play this clip and then get Alan Watts' expert take on it and we'll go right to your calls.
[03:36:12.563 --> 03:36:15.145]  The night video of the Obamanoids beating on doors.
[03:36:15.145 --> 03:36:15.946]  Join us!
[03:36:15.946 --> 03:36:17.046]  Join us!
[03:36:17.046 --> 03:36:18.588]  Pledge to support the bankers!
[03:36:18.588 --> 03:36:19.808]  Literally!
[03:36:19.808 --> 03:36:22.530]  So this is pure fascism slash communism.
[03:36:22.530 --> 03:36:25.232]  But here is the Cobra Commander clip.
[03:36:25.232 --> 03:36:27.114]  Guys, we're going to play the CNN next.
[03:36:27.114 --> 03:36:28.835]  Can you pull me up the Cobra Commander?
[03:36:28.835 --> 03:36:29.716]  Okay, go ahead and play it.
[03:36:29.716 --> 03:36:30.076]  Here it is.
[03:36:33.661 --> 03:36:47.969]  Due to the financial irresponsibility and incompetence of your leaders, Cobra has found it necessary to restructure your nation's economy.
[03:36:47.969 --> 03:36:58.996]  We have begun by eliminating the worthless green paper which your government has distributed to the free is valuable.
[03:36:58.996 --> 03:37:01.217]  Cobra will come to your rescue!
[03:37:10.201 --> 03:37:21.251]  I am pleased to announce Cobra's economic recovery plan.
[03:37:21.251 --> 03:37:30.980]  If you want money to buy food for your children, take all your valuables to the nearest branch of extensive enterprises.
[03:37:31.787 --> 03:37:38.069]  There, all goods will be exchanged for Cobra Currency!
[03:37:38.069 --> 03:37:40.290]  Ah, gold money!
[03:37:40.290 --> 03:37:45.171]  So see... Oh, it's just amazing programming.
[03:37:45.171 --> 03:37:48.212]  If you want gold, you're the person destroying the economy.
[03:37:48.212 --> 03:37:49.812]  You're Cobra Commander.
[03:37:49.812 --> 03:37:51.713]  Alan Watt.
[03:37:51.713 --> 03:37:52.833]  Yeah, I believe in the name.
[03:37:52.833 --> 03:37:55.494]  That means that the snake system isn't the serpent system.
[03:37:56.198 --> 03:37:58.540]  So even that was tucked in there, too.
[03:37:58.540 --> 03:38:02.825]  But all these cartoons, really, it's even worse today.
[03:38:02.825 --> 03:38:10.793]  If you were watching the cartoons for children, it's full of programming and messages of what's to come.
[03:38:10.793 --> 03:38:19.162]  And again, we've got to realize that the big boys wrote about this extensively in the 40s, 50s, 60s, all through, that they'd use all media.
[03:38:20.269 --> 03:38:21.629]  To get their message across.
[03:38:21.629 --> 03:38:31.351]  By the way, Fox News has now put out a 10-minute promo piece admitting they're planting pro-global warming eugenics ads in all their TV shows and media.
[03:38:31.351 --> 03:38:32.931]  So this is now admitted.
[03:38:32.931 --> 03:38:36.532]  Explain to people what predictive programming is.
[03:38:36.532 --> 03:38:47.974]  Predictive programming is a technique developed and perfected at Tavistock Institutes in London on behalf of the British oligarchy that always has run Britain.
[03:38:48.618 --> 03:38:50.742]  And the idea is very simple.
[03:38:50.742 --> 03:38:59.459]  It's through fiction, through works of fiction, where you're getting crossed in a story and the male will identify with the hero, the woman with the heroine.
[03:39:01.465 --> 03:39:13.752]  And once you're hooked in emotional stories, generally bad guys on the run from the good guys who go after them with overwhelming force, they then tuck in the prediction of what's to come.
[03:39:13.752 --> 03:39:19.956]  You'll see things still to come, like cops smashing down doors, no warrants, all that kind of stuff will be in the story.
[03:39:19.956 --> 03:39:24.439]  And you won't mind because this guy they're after is the worst mass murderer pedophile
[03:39:24.719 --> 03:39:25.679]  You can ever imagine.
[03:39:25.679 --> 03:39:32.342]  And therefore, you accept all the things you're seeing where the law itself is disregarded to get this bad guy.
[03:39:32.342 --> 03:39:37.165]  Therefore, when it happens in real life, you're familiar with the idea, and you ask no questions.
[03:39:37.165 --> 03:39:45.809]  It seems quite natural to you to see it happen in real life just the same way it was in the fictional movies or television drama series.
[03:39:45.809 --> 03:39:48.110]  They're using them now to full force.
[03:39:48.110 --> 03:39:53.392]  Every country has its anti-terrorism dramas, ongoing dramas.
[03:39:54.311 --> 03:40:03.999]  Britain has them, Canada even has one, where they send off jets to the border, to the bridges, to guard against terrorism, and it's a tremendous threat to avoid.
[03:40:03.999 --> 03:40:12.345]  And in the show, Spooks in England and all these shows here, they torture people's children to get answers, and that stops the nuke from going off, so torturing children's good.
[03:40:12.345 --> 03:40:17.269]  Then it comes out in the media, they are torturing people's children for fake confessions.
[03:40:17.269 --> 03:40:17.750]  All of it...
[03:40:18.550 --> 03:40:19.371]  Getting everybody ready.
[03:40:19.371 --> 03:40:24.294]  All these new movies about you take the vaccine and it actually kills you, like I Am Legend.
[03:40:24.294 --> 03:40:29.318]  So then when we also talk about it, they say, oh, you got that from a movie.
[03:40:29.318 --> 03:40:29.698]  Yeah.
[03:40:29.698 --> 03:40:30.178]  Yeah.
[03:40:30.178 --> 03:40:34.682]  Or people who watch the movies and enjoy this series will say, well, so what?
[03:40:34.682 --> 03:40:36.623]  Because they've already been programmed.
[03:40:36.623 --> 03:40:39.505]  They have been programmed that this is all quite normal to them.
[03:40:39.813 --> 03:40:42.114]  We'll take NYPD, Blue, and all these other shows.
[03:40:42.114 --> 03:40:45.736]  Every episode, the cops beat somebody, but the guy's always guilty.
[03:40:45.736 --> 03:40:47.097]  It was right to do it.
[03:40:47.097 --> 03:40:47.738]  Exactly.
[03:40:47.738 --> 03:40:55.802]  Mask conditioning, masks, because as mammals, we accept what we see on TV as the way we're supposed to behave as pack creatures.
[03:40:55.802 --> 03:40:58.224]  Very, very serious, folks.
[03:40:58.224 --> 03:40:59.944]  Let's go ahead and play the new G.I.
[03:40:59.944 --> 03:41:00.225]  Joe.
[03:41:00.225 --> 03:41:01.565]  Everybody join the military.
[03:41:01.565 --> 03:41:02.686]  It's an army unit.
[03:41:02.686 --> 03:41:05.408]  You get to be a superhero if you have it.
[03:41:05.408 --> 03:41:08.269]  And again, you're fighting the Wicked Cobra.
[03:41:08.269 --> 03:41:09.290]  So, here it is.
[03:41:14.261 --> 03:41:20.525]  When I'm finished, the world will never forget.
[03:41:20.525 --> 03:41:22.527]  Make the call.
[03:41:22.527 --> 03:41:23.147]  Count up!
[03:41:23.147 --> 03:41:25.609]  Technically, we don't exist.
[03:41:25.609 --> 03:41:28.351]  We answer to no one.
[03:41:28.351 --> 03:41:32.114]  And when all else fails, we don't.
[03:41:32.114 --> 03:41:35.016]  What did you say your unit was called?
[03:41:35.016 --> 03:41:40.019]  I didn't.
[03:41:40.019 --> 03:41:41.961]  GI Joe The Rise of Cobra.
[03:41:43.018 --> 03:41:51.225]  Now, in real life, the Special Combat Applications Group, Delta Force, and others run around dealing drugs, killing people, buying off local governments, overthrowing governments, taking over the U.S.
[03:41:51.225 --> 03:41:57.429]  But here, they're heroes fighting the evil terrorist.
[03:41:57.429 --> 03:41:59.171]  Alan Watt, I don't think it's working anymore, though.
[03:42:00.682 --> 03:42:01.562]  No, it's not.
[03:42:01.562 --> 03:42:07.664]  So there are people who have caught on to it and have been aware for a few years, because it has got rather blatant.
[03:42:07.664 --> 03:42:15.846]  People who haven't watched television for a few years and suddenly switch it on, you wonder which world you're in, because you see the programming very easily.
[03:42:15.846 --> 03:42:18.286]  Very easily, if you've been away from television for a while.
[03:42:18.286 --> 03:42:22.087]  Those who continuously watch television, they don't notice the changes at all.
[03:42:22.087 --> 03:42:23.088]  That's right.
[03:42:23.088 --> 03:42:24.008]  And they don't really care.
[03:42:24.008 --> 03:42:26.268]  They'll say, well, the police have to do this.
[03:42:26.268 --> 03:42:28.509]  Well, they've been saying that because they watch the dramas.
[03:42:29.169 --> 03:42:39.138]  If you don't watch a lot of TV, you miss all the little sub-downloads slowly changing your view, and then it's very disjointed, and you're like, whoa!
[03:42:39.138 --> 03:42:42.481]  So I guess the first step is stop watching mainstream television.
[03:42:42.481 --> 03:42:43.242]  I want to go to calls.
[03:42:43.242 --> 03:42:44.463]  I'm going to play this CNN clip.
[03:42:44.463 --> 03:42:49.027]  We're going to do 20 minutes of overdrive only at PrisonPlanet.tv and TheInfoWars.com.
[03:42:49.027 --> 03:42:52.310]  Stream's coming up at the end of the show in T-minus 18 minutes.
[03:42:52.310 --> 03:42:53.631]  Right now, Mark in Oregon.
[03:42:53.631 --> 03:42:54.672]  You're on the air with Alan Watt.
[03:42:54.672 --> 03:42:55.013]  Go ahead.
[03:42:57.346 --> 03:42:58.086]  Sorry about that.
[03:42:58.086 --> 03:43:00.887]  Well, thank you.
[03:43:00.887 --> 03:43:02.047]  Thank you very much.
[03:43:02.047 --> 03:43:04.608]  Great to speak with you and Alan.
[03:43:04.608 --> 03:43:07.669]  Alan, I'd like to get your opinion on something.
[03:43:07.669 --> 03:43:17.232]  I have an idea that I feel could be very effective in this struggle of humanity against the coming tyranny here, and as the tyranny currently exists.
[03:43:18.063 --> 03:43:19.083]  You know, I like Alex.
[03:43:19.083 --> 03:43:21.904]  I really respect your intelligence and your heart, Alan.
[03:43:21.904 --> 03:43:23.104]  That's why I'm asking you this.
[03:43:23.104 --> 03:43:25.205]  It'll take me about one minute to go over it.
[03:43:25.205 --> 03:43:26.725]  Okay, go over it!
[03:43:26.725 --> 03:43:29.246]  And, uh... And turn the radio off, too.
[03:43:29.246 --> 03:43:30.046]  Yeah, do me a big favor.
[03:43:30.046 --> 03:43:31.247]  Turn the radio off.
[03:43:31.247 --> 03:43:32.407]  My radio is off.
[03:43:32.407 --> 03:43:34.568]  Okay, well, I'm getting echoed, but go ahead.
[03:43:34.568 --> 03:43:35.928]  Okay.
[03:43:35.928 --> 03:43:42.690]  Uh, Alan, the only and by far the most powerful weapon, which is readily available,
[03:43:43.693 --> 03:43:55.297]  Uh, as we speak to deal in a very, to deal a very substantial blow to the enemy's progress here and, and its implementation of world tyranny as a weapon of publicity.
[03:43:55.297 --> 03:44:09.121]  And the logical vehicle as well as the only vehicle available to spread on a global basis, not only the urgency of the very short time that the world's people have until they will all be under total and complete tyranny.
[03:44:09.758 --> 03:44:24.686]  But also to achieve the ultimate projection of the facts of truth of the Infowar is the combination of Alex's celebrity, a fusing as such, of the world celebrity of Alex Jones
[03:44:25.566 --> 03:44:28.648]  Into a globally effective vehicle of publicity.
[03:44:28.648 --> 03:44:30.268]  Alright, let me just stop you for a minute.
[03:44:30.268 --> 03:44:32.250]  I am not that big, okay?
[03:44:32.250 --> 03:44:35.151]  And I don't want to be some big giant leader that's very dangerous.
[03:44:35.151 --> 03:44:41.514]  The reason we have power on this show is we have great activists, listeners, who are great leaders in their own right.
[03:44:41.514 --> 03:44:46.157]  People are always thinking, I can do this magic bullet, that magic bullet, I can barely get the trash taken out around here.
[03:44:46.157 --> 03:44:48.798]  So, uh, but finish up your point because I want to get to everybody else.
[03:44:48.798 --> 03:44:54.181]  But you, as you said, you know, you are the globally recognized leader of this freedom movement.
[03:44:54.830 --> 03:44:59.935]  And I only see one available and viable vehicle, and that is a movie.
[03:44:59.935 --> 03:45:03.578]  It'd be about the 14 years of your radio life, Alex.
[03:45:03.578 --> 03:45:12.227]  It could be made with the assistance of the many and varied producers, directors, and actors whom you know personally and who admire you.
[03:45:12.227 --> 03:45:18.953]  And it would, I believe, assist in the production, the financing, and the acting parts
[03:45:19.591 --> 03:45:20.954]  With you playing yourself.
[03:45:20.954 --> 03:45:22.877]  Not when people threaten to kill their children.
[03:45:22.877 --> 03:45:27.426]  We've already tried to put out another film and they threatened to kill people's children so they pulled out.
[03:45:27.426 --> 03:45:28.808]  But listen, I appreciate your call.
[03:45:29.938 --> 03:45:34.740]  They can defeat anything that is based on one move, okay?
[03:45:34.740 --> 03:45:50.846]  But we have to be like a hundred-headed Hydra, but not just that, you know, a hundred hundred-headed Hydras, and that's why I bring Alan Watt and others to try to build them up, and, you know, and he's doing that in his own right, so I don't agree on this, you know, single-move thing or trying to produce a film, they just then wouldn't distribute it.
[03:45:50.846 --> 03:45:52.947]  You want to explain that to people, Alan?
[03:45:52.947 --> 03:45:53.968]  Yes, true as well.
[03:45:53.968 --> 03:45:59.530]  You've got to understand as well that everyone out there has to fight for their own life, basically, and for their children.
[03:46:00.433 --> 03:46:05.756]  And it's too easy to one way or another, legally or otherwise, get rid of someone at the top.
[03:46:05.756 --> 03:46:09.378]  And when you're gone, the one who's leading you is over.
[03:46:09.378 --> 03:46:13.481]  You're like bureaucrats without the leader at the top.
[03:46:13.481 --> 03:46:14.221]  It's the same thing.
[03:46:14.221 --> 03:46:16.383]  So you've got to be your own champion.
[03:46:16.383 --> 03:46:17.963]  And you have to do the legwork.
[03:46:17.963 --> 03:46:20.265]  You have to go out and be vocal.
[03:46:20.265 --> 03:46:21.466]  Everyone's involved here.
[03:46:21.466 --> 03:46:22.446]  Everyone is involved.
[03:46:22.446 --> 03:46:24.367]  We've got to stop looking for champions.
[03:46:24.367 --> 03:46:25.608]  You are your own champion.
[03:46:25.748 --> 03:46:32.011]  Well that's one of the biggest forms of programming is the Arnold Schwarzenegger or whoever the archetypal Hercules archetype.
[03:46:32.011 --> 03:46:42.556]  He goes out and slays the dragons for you and then people constantly think, no, no, no, the reason we're successful here is we're getting the people to go out and mobilize and then it's a thousand heads.
[03:46:42.556 --> 03:46:46.638]  They have no way of stopping us that way if it's an idea.
[03:46:46.638 --> 03:46:51.941]  I'm not bulletproof, Alan Watts not bulletproof, but ideas are bulletproof.
[03:46:51.941 --> 03:46:53.002]  That's correct and also
[03:46:54.878 --> 03:47:04.245]  Look, I realize as well that anyone can be threatened or got to one way or another, or blackmailed, or your family threatened or something.
[03:47:04.245 --> 03:47:09.489]  So when you have one leader of a personality cult, that's why they've been in the movies.
[03:47:09.489 --> 03:47:12.532]  So many movies I've had for the 20 years.
[03:47:12.532 --> 03:47:13.212]  The One.
[03:47:13.212 --> 03:47:14.473]  The One is coming to help.
[03:47:14.473 --> 03:47:14.993]  That's right.
[03:47:14.993 --> 03:47:17.235]  The Savior, the Army of One.
[03:47:17.235 --> 03:47:18.096]  One person.
[03:47:18.096 --> 03:47:18.856]  It's Obama.
[03:47:18.856 --> 03:47:19.517]  It's whoever.
[03:47:19.517 --> 03:47:20.558]  They've got to save you.
[03:47:20.558 --> 03:47:22.980]  It's always about making you feel inadequate.
[03:47:22.980 --> 03:47:24.541]  That's what Madison Avenue is all about.
[03:47:24.981 --> 03:47:25.741]  Exactly.
[03:47:25.741 --> 03:47:33.786]  And people have to realize, no, you are your own champion and your own family depends on what you do and everyone else around you as well.
[03:47:33.786 --> 03:47:35.387]  So everyone is involved in this.
[03:47:35.387 --> 03:47:35.807]  There's
[03:47:36.480 --> 03:47:41.744]  No one of us who talk on radio can stop it all happening for you.
[03:47:41.744 --> 03:47:47.269]  We can certainly try and impede it and get the word out, but it's up to you to do your own part in that.
[03:47:47.269 --> 03:47:48.390]  Yeah, and I mean, it's part of it.
[03:47:48.390 --> 03:47:56.796]  Sure, they made a film about getting started, you know, being threatened by the military, Bohemian Grove, all the stuff we've been through, you know, all the things we've broken and covered.
[03:47:56.796 --> 03:48:00.159]  That would be interesting, but that would only be one part of the solution, you know,
[03:48:00.519 --> 03:48:02.860]  It's, again, it's a movement of liberty and awakening.
[03:48:02.860 --> 03:48:04.201]  But thank you, Mark.
[03:48:04.201 --> 03:48:05.061]  I appreciate your support.
[03:48:05.061 --> 03:48:06.282]  I'm not poo-pooing your idea.
[03:48:06.282 --> 03:48:08.763]  I'm just bringing more perspective to it.
[03:48:08.763 --> 03:48:09.883]  Steve in Chicago.
[03:48:09.883 --> 03:48:11.644]  Steve, you're on the air.
[03:48:11.644 --> 03:48:24.049]  Alex, I hate to say this, but I think Alan Watt and the Watson Brothers are an MI6 spy nest, and they've poisoned your mind subliminally and subconsciously with anger and culture.
[03:48:24.049 --> 03:48:26.090]  Let me explain something to you, sir.
[03:48:26.090 --> 03:48:26.631]  That's funny.
[03:48:28.337 --> 03:48:32.539]  Alan Watt and the Watson Brothers are not related.
[03:48:32.539 --> 03:48:40.243]  Paul Watson was running a tiny website and had never been contacted by me, and I called up and said, would you like to do webmaster work for me?
[03:48:40.243 --> 03:48:43.385]  And I'm going to start a website called PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:48:43.385 --> 03:48:45.486]  So, let's get one thing straight.
[03:48:45.486 --> 03:48:46.366]  It works like this.
[03:48:46.366 --> 03:48:48.708]  I call Paul Watson up and tell him what I want done.
[03:48:48.708 --> 03:48:50.048]  We're friends, but that's it.
[03:48:50.048 --> 03:48:51.869]  I talk to Paul about twice a week.
[03:48:51.869 --> 03:48:52.209]  Okay?
[03:48:52.209 --> 03:48:53.970]  There's one person running things in this office.
[03:48:53.970 --> 03:48:54.991]  It's me.
[03:48:54.991 --> 03:48:55.531]  Me.
[03:48:55.531 --> 03:48:56.411]  There's no handlers.
[03:48:56.411 --> 03:48:57.012]  There's none of that.
[03:48:57.492 --> 03:48:59.073]  And the same thing with Alan Watt.
[03:48:59.073 --> 03:48:59.493]  I mean, why?
[03:48:59.493 --> 03:49:00.813]  Because they got British accents?
[03:49:00.813 --> 03:49:01.634]  They must be bad?
[03:49:01.634 --> 03:49:03.435]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[03:49:03.435 --> 03:49:04.875]  Well, that's the point.
[03:49:04.875 --> 03:49:07.536]  You know, the situation is this.
[03:49:07.536 --> 03:49:08.857]  All this Anglican culture.
[03:49:08.857 --> 03:49:13.239]  We got Roger Kipling and the white man's burden, which must be observed.
[03:49:13.239 --> 03:49:14.279]  Un-Germanic.
[03:49:14.279 --> 03:49:17.941]  We have the Sir Thomas More utopianism.
[03:49:17.941 --> 03:49:18.681]  Un-Germanic.
[03:49:18.681 --> 03:49:20.282]  Must be observed.
[03:49:20.282 --> 03:49:21.742]  We have the angry young men.
[03:49:21.742 --> 03:49:23.683]  Social injustices to minorities.
[03:49:24.333 --> 03:49:27.276]  Sir, I gotta let you go.
[03:49:27.276 --> 03:49:28.497]  This is too insane.
[03:49:28.497 --> 03:49:34.862]  I mean, Alan Watt exposes Rudger Kipling as pushing the Anglo-American establishment.
[03:49:34.862 --> 03:49:36.923]  Alan, you know, it's just crazy.
[03:49:36.923 --> 03:49:42.648]  We're trying to mobilize people to a national draft that passed the House Friday, and they don't want to discuss that.
[03:49:42.648 --> 03:49:43.489]  It's all about us.
[03:49:43.489 --> 03:49:46.131]  See how they're obsessed with us because we're the supposed leaders?
[03:49:47.082 --> 03:49:47.603]  That's right.
[03:49:47.603 --> 03:49:51.849]  There are people who are in their little tunnels and you'll never change their minds on anything.
[03:49:51.849 --> 03:49:52.430]  They're stuck.
[03:49:52.430 --> 03:49:56.936]  They like where they are and have decided that's all they need to know and that's it.
[03:49:56.936 --> 03:49:58.598]  They're closed to anything further.
[03:49:59.798 --> 03:50:07.600]  I mean, does it matter if I talk to a member of the Japanese Diet exposing 9-11 as an inside job, or if I interview the former German Defense Minister, or I interview Alan Watt?
[03:50:07.600 --> 03:50:11.541]  I mean, most Americans don't even have passports and don't travel anywhere.
[03:50:11.541 --> 03:50:17.743]  I mean, it's now I'm evil because you've got a British accent, Alan, when all you do is expose the British Empire.
[03:50:17.743 --> 03:50:21.484]  This is the height of just one-dimensional thinking.
[03:50:21.484 --> 03:50:24.184]  See, Obama must be good because he's black, see?
[03:50:24.184 --> 03:50:26.765]  But you must be bad because you've got a British accent.
[03:50:27.301 --> 03:50:28.082]  That's right.
[03:50:28.082 --> 03:50:28.522]  That's right.
[03:50:28.522 --> 03:50:35.350]  And some people, too, still think I am the Alan Watts that was lecturing back in the 20s and 30s.
[03:50:35.350 --> 03:50:37.232]  I'd have to be about 90 if I was him.
[03:50:37.232 --> 03:50:46.542]  Well, that's how this thing that I'm some Catholic assassin, I'm not even Catholic, started, because there was a black guy named Alex Jones, and people said, why are you writing this, Alex?
[03:50:46.542 --> 03:50:48.364]  And I said, that's not me, and I didn't
[03:50:48.404 --> 03:50:49.506]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:02.179 --> 03:51:04.600]  Worried about the side effects from prescription drugs?
[03:51:04.600 --> 03:51:08.382]  Tired of searching for an effective, safe, natural alternative you can trust?
[03:51:08.382 --> 03:51:12.544]  Join more than 300,000 people worldwide who trust in native remedies.
[03:51:12.544 --> 03:51:18.887]  Our market-leading natural remedies are manufactured using the highest quality ingredients in FDA-registered facilities.

[03:51:39.384 --> 03:51:43.509]  And all Native Remedies products come with a one-year unconditional money-back guarantee.
[03:51:43.789 --> 03:51:47.452]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.798 --> 03:52:14.681]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.681 --> 03:52:21.185]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:21.185 --> 03:52:23.166]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:23.166 --> 03:52:25.607]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.607 --> 03:52:36.513]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.797 --> 03:52:40.459]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.459 --> 03:52:42.320]  It's about a one world government.
[03:52:42.320 --> 03:52:49.247]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:49.247 --> 03:52:57.495]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:57.495 --> 03:52:59.077]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:59.077 --> 03:53:00.278]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.886 --> 03:53:06.069]  Do you suffer from aches and pains in your knees, arms, wrists, or elbows?
[03:53:06.069 --> 03:53:09.711]  Is it difficult to get out of bed in the morning because of joint stiffness?
[03:53:09.711 --> 03:53:13.553]  Have you been looking for a safe, natural alternative to help ease your pain?
[03:53:13.553 --> 03:53:16.795]  If so, you need to visit solartherm.ca.
[03:53:16.795 --> 03:53:21.558]  SolarTherm, the pain care you wear, is a patented ceramic fiber support technology.
[03:53:21.778 --> 03:53:26.341]  It holds in and reflects your own body heat, soothing those sore areas.
[03:53:26.341 --> 03:53:33.224]  Solar Therm is extremely light and comfortable to wear, and increases blood flow to the affected areas without the use of toxic chemicals.
[03:53:33.224 --> 03:53:39.067]  Imagine being able to finally relieve the aches and pains in your elbows, knees, wrists, back, and more.
[03:53:39.067 --> 03:53:41.569]  So forget about messy creams that have an unpleasant smell.
[03:53:41.969 --> 03:53:44.391]  Try Solartherm, the pain care you wear.
[03:53:44.391 --> 03:53:45.072]  Call them today at 1-877-747-6664.
[03:53:45.072 --> 03:53:45.372]  That's 1-877-747-6664.
[03:53:45.372 --> 03:53:47.474]  Or visit them online at solartherm.ca.
[03:53:47.474 --> 03:53:49.516]  That's solar, T-H-E-R-M, solartherm.ca.
[03:54:09.708 --> 03:54:14.198]  Okay, all the callers that are on hold... Abby, Ken, Nick, and...
[03:54:17.236 --> 03:54:20.480]  Brent, I want you to call this number right now because we're going to take 20 minutes of calls.
[03:54:20.480 --> 03:54:25.985]  We're going to overdrive at PrisonPlanet.tv and the InfoWars and PrisonPlanet.com streams.
[03:54:25.985 --> 03:54:26.586]  You need to go there.
[03:54:26.586 --> 03:54:28.128]  We'll be on the AM and FM.
[03:54:28.128 --> 03:54:29.869]  We'll do 20 minutes of overdrive with Alan Watt.
[03:54:29.869 --> 03:54:31.051]  The number for you to call is 888-201-2244.
[03:54:31.051 --> 03:54:31.111]  888-201-2244.
[03:54:31.111 --> 03:54:31.151]  888-201-2244.
[03:54:39.841 --> 03:54:44.464]  And they'll go to the head of the line, those folks that are holding Abby Kent, Nick and Brent.
[03:54:44.464 --> 03:54:49.827]  I've got a few things I want to plug here, and I want to play a little bit of the clip of CNN with them going door-to-door with their brainwashing.
[03:54:49.827 --> 03:54:55.551]  But before I do that, some of the sponsors that have made today's show possible.
[03:54:55.551 --> 03:54:58.112]  One of them is Ecola Blue, the atmospheric water generator.
[03:54:58.112 --> 03:54:58.813]  Amazing system.
[03:54:58.813 --> 03:55:00.234]  Seven and a half gallons a day.
[03:55:00.234 --> 03:55:01.234]  We have one right here in the office.
[03:55:01.234 --> 03:55:01.935]  I have one at home.
[03:55:01.935 --> 03:55:02.335]  I love it.
[03:55:02.335 --> 03:55:05.197]  Then it goes through seven filters, including reverse osmosis.
[03:55:05.197 --> 03:55:07.018]  Inside, a fabulous system.
[03:55:07.018 --> 03:55:08.779]  E-C-O-L-O blue dot com.
[03:55:09.179 --> 03:55:09.479]  I don't know.
[03:55:30.985 --> 03:55:33.548]  There's a war on against hybrid seeds and non-GMO seeds.
[03:55:33.548 --> 03:55:36.250]  They're buying them up, putting them in UN seed vaults.
[03:55:36.250 --> 03:55:38.352]  You can Google that and read BBC about it.
[03:55:38.352 --> 03:55:44.779]  Solutions from science are trying to get the seeds out of the globalist's hands, into the hands of the people, one survival seed bank at a time.
[03:55:44.779 --> 03:55:46.881]  Their website is survivalseedbank.com or 877-327-0365.
[03:55:46.881 --> 03:55:47.922]  Again, that number.
[03:55:51.305 --> 03:55:55.588]  877-327-0365, survivalseedbank.com.
[03:55:55.588 --> 03:55:59.892]  And lastly, also from Solutions in Science, mysolarbackup.com.
[03:55:59.892 --> 03:56:01.132]  Mysolarbackup.com.
[03:56:01.132 --> 03:56:05.396]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power during hurricanes, snow, ice storms, and other things.
[03:56:05.396 --> 03:56:09.439]  Listeners should be moving towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that.
[03:56:09.439 --> 03:56:13.122]  A solar power generator is available from our long-time sponsor, Solutions for some Science.
[03:56:13.122 --> 03:56:19.627]  You get an emergency power backup kit, which consists of a power source, 1800 power plant, and high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[03:56:20.407 --> 03:56:24.953]  Remember, too, that gas generators won't be working because they'll need gas if we go into this crisis.
[03:56:24.953 --> 03:56:26.295]  MySolarBackup.com.
[03:56:26.295 --> 03:56:26.896]  Get off the grid.
[03:56:26.896 --> 03:56:26.956]  877-327-0365.
[03:56:26.956 --> 03:56:27.016]  877-327-0365.
[03:56:27.016 --> 03:56:27.637]  MySolarBackup.com.
[03:56:34.929 --> 03:56:44.795]  We are posting up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the next 20 minutes the best free copy we found on YouTube or anywhere on the web of the Obama deception.
[03:56:44.795 --> 03:56:46.956]  And I want you to make it go mega viral again.
[03:56:46.956 --> 03:56:48.277]  They've been censoring it.
[03:56:48.277 --> 03:56:49.578]  We can't allow this to happen.
[03:56:49.578 --> 03:56:51.779]  Help us get it out to everybody.
[03:56:51.779 --> 03:56:52.639]  I made the film.
[03:56:52.639 --> 03:56:53.080]  It's free.
[03:56:53.080 --> 03:56:55.381]  You can order the high quality DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:56:55.381 --> 03:56:56.402]  Please support us.
[03:56:56.402 --> 03:57:01.805]  Or get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership and watch the PrisonPlanet.tv show and get all my films in high quality and burn them to disk.
[03:57:02.205 --> 03:57:04.086]  It's got DivX, all of it made easy.
[03:57:04.086 --> 03:57:08.087]  But the big deal is, they've censored this thing off the main page at YouTube and Google.
[03:57:08.087 --> 03:57:08.847]  We've caught them.
[03:57:08.847 --> 03:57:11.528]  Please, this article's going out in the next few minutes.
[03:57:11.528 --> 03:57:14.949]  Get it out to everybody at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:57:14.949 --> 03:57:23.972]  Alan Watt, in closing, we're going to come back and take calls after this one-minute break, but I wanted to ask you about the psychological system of... I've noticed they've also programmed people where they can... it's like Crimestop.
[03:57:23.972 --> 03:57:28.433]  They can't ever focus on the issue or documents of FEMA camps or real things.
[03:57:28.433 --> 03:57:31.494]  They always go into weird conspiratorial subterfuge
[03:57:32.952 --> 03:57:33.092]  Yes.
[03:57:33.092 --> 03:57:39.057]  Tremendous psychology involved in all of this and the whole world is run under psychology and the guys that make all the dramas on television.
[03:57:57.563 --> 03:58:00.530]  Have their instructions from top psychologists.
[03:58:00.530 --> 03:58:03.757]  And it's even altered for different ethnic peoples in different countries.
[03:58:03.757 --> 03:58:06.563]  The same programs, in fact, same scripts.
[03:58:06.563 --> 03:58:08.287]  So, we're under tremendous warfare, yeah.
[03:58:10.439 --> 03:58:11.300]  Absolutely, Alan.
[03:58:11.300 --> 03:58:13.541]  Let's flesh that out more.
[03:58:13.541 --> 03:58:16.443]  We got you on a new line so that we can continue over in our studio.
[03:58:16.443 --> 03:58:17.064]  It's a little bit low.
[03:58:17.064 --> 03:58:18.225]  We're going to boost that.
[03:58:18.225 --> 03:58:29.012]  We're going to come back and recap all that with Alan Watt going into overdrive and your phone calls coming up at the toll-free number that I just gave out a few minutes ago.
[03:58:29.012 --> 03:58:30.233]  Again, I want to thank all the Eminem officials.
[03:58:30.453 --> 03:58:31.454]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:31.454 --> 03:58:32.754]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.974 --> 03:58:53.656]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.656 --> 03:58:58.402]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:58.402 --> 03:59:01.365]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:01.365 --> 03:59:04.409]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:04.409 --> 03:59:09.135]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:59:09.355 --> 03:59:10.476]  If you simply prepare.
[03:59:10.476 --> 03:59:13.717]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:59:13.717 --> 03:59:20.721]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:59:20.721 --> 03:59:24.003]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[03:59:24.003 --> 03:59:24.243]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[03:59:26.684 --> 03:59:29.145]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:59:29.145 --> 03:59:35.407]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[03:59:35.407 --> 03:59:39.008]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[03:59:39.008 --> 03:59:40.528]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:59:40.528 --> 03:59:41.148]  Take action today.
[03:59:41.148 --> 03:59:42.969]  The first step is getting storable food.
[03:59:55.738 --> 03:59:58.780]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[04:00:25.219 --> 04:00:41.414]  DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN
[04:00:42.415 --> 04:00:49.120]  As soon as you guys give me a updated phone list on that toll-free number we gave out, right before we ended the main radio show.
[04:00:49.120 --> 04:00:50.321]  I do this maybe once a month.
[04:00:50.321 --> 04:00:52.202]  We go into overdrive now.
[04:00:52.202 --> 04:00:59.588]  Going back to Alan Watt, finishing up the point you were making about, you know, we see people when they're told they have cancer, they get mad at the doctor.
[04:00:59.588 --> 04:01:09.375]  Or, you know, we bring them this message and then somehow about half the time of people fighting the New World Order, and if we could stop this, we would actually, you know, win and be able to defeat the globalists.
[04:01:09.375 --> 04:01:10.196]  We're already very close.
[04:01:10.896 --> 04:01:14.457]  It's obsessions on those of us that are standing up and speaking out.
[04:01:14.457 --> 04:01:20.399]  Then I see great people like NuffRespect, who's had probably 40, 50 million.
[04:01:20.399 --> 04:01:23.561]  I mean, he's got videos with 10 million views apiece.
[04:01:23.561 --> 04:01:27.482]  And a couple years ago, you know, all his videos would get 2, 3, 4 million views.
[04:01:27.482 --> 04:01:32.464]  Suddenly they started restricting his views and now his videos will say 5 million views or from 5 million to 5,000.
[04:01:33.865 --> 04:01:34.305]  Yeah.
[04:01:50.871 --> 04:01:57.154]  And so a lot of people that stick their head up to fight the New World Order get attacked by the pre-programmed mass of people.
[04:01:57.154 --> 04:02:07.358]  Not just those that openly disagree with us and want the New World Order or say it doesn't exist, but by the bottom feeders and the government operatives and their camp followers that then attack anyone that sticks their head up.
[04:02:07.358 --> 04:02:09.979]  Kind of the crab syndrome or crabs in a bucket.
[04:02:09.979 --> 04:02:15.561]  If you've ever been fishing for crabs, we'll try to stop any other crab from crawling out instead of working together.
[04:02:15.561 --> 04:02:17.342]  I see that as the biggest thing to break.
[04:02:17.802 --> 04:02:24.790]  Yes, well I was reading a book quite a few years ago on how this would unfold in society and they said they would actually encourage those in what they called the fringe group.
[04:02:34.614 --> 04:02:41.940]  By that, they meant those who are borderline, there's a lot of borderline psychotics, and they would encourage that group.
[04:02:41.940 --> 04:02:51.568]  In fact, they might even, especially on the internets, they can come into their sites and encourage the psychotic ones to attack personalities who are being effective.
[04:02:51.568 --> 04:02:54.751]  So that is actually underway right now on a big scale.
[04:02:55.576 --> 04:03:11.851]  I know that for a fact many people who go into the forums will tell you they'll start off fine and someone comes in, they'll all like this person, he's got lots of information, next thing you know he's got them all fighting each other or going off on a different tangent and or attacking someone who is effective.
[04:03:11.851 --> 04:03:16.876]  The idea being that if you get up there and have a voice and you're an
[04:03:17.536 --> 04:03:22.398]  Really altering the outlook of many people, then you must be one of them.
[04:03:22.398 --> 04:03:23.758]  That's the first thing they jump at.
[04:03:23.758 --> 04:03:26.139]  They don't think you can be genuine at all.
[04:03:26.139 --> 04:03:30.341]  It is true that in the past, agencies have put their own people in place.
[04:03:30.341 --> 04:03:34.222]  We know that with certain people who did the Patriot rounds in fact years ago.
[04:03:35.158 --> 04:03:40.719]  And it's admitted afterwards they were government operatives by themselves.
[04:03:40.719 --> 04:03:46.100]  So yeah, you can't trust everyone, but you don't attack everyone either who's getting the word out.
[04:03:46.100 --> 04:03:50.421]  And we're not advising you as to what to do, except to protest.
[04:03:50.421 --> 04:03:51.421]  You can protest.
[04:03:51.421 --> 04:03:58.842]  That's the only right we have left at the moment, is to protest what's happening in the world.
[04:03:58.842 --> 04:04:00.463]  We know what the next step would be.
[04:04:00.463 --> 04:04:01.563]  The other boys know it too.
[04:04:02.537 --> 04:04:10.861]  So all we can do is protest and say no and do the Gandhi thing and go along with that and just hope that that's enough.
[04:04:10.861 --> 04:04:13.141]  Well, absolutely, Alan.
[04:04:13.141 --> 04:04:14.642]  Getting an echo there, guys.
[04:04:14.642 --> 04:04:20.385]  We also see these formulas where what happens is
[04:04:22.105 --> 04:04:26.569]  Somebody will come on the scene, start a radio show or website for about a year, and they'll act normal.
[04:04:26.569 --> 04:04:28.591]  And they'll get credibility.
[04:04:28.591 --> 04:04:37.579]  And then suddenly they attack everybody and create infighting and lies, and then it's even come out in cases that they indeed were on government payroll.
[04:04:37.579 --> 04:04:38.099]  That's right.
[04:04:38.099 --> 04:04:46.487]  In fact, the obvious one that comes to mind, and this is public knowledge because he was on television right after 9-11, was Colonel Bo Grites.
[04:04:47.899 --> 04:04:51.161]  He started his own shortwave Patriot station.
[04:04:51.161 --> 04:04:52.802]  He was collecting the names of people.
[04:04:52.802 --> 04:04:57.244]  He said on the air many times he left the Pentagon with hip pocket orders.
[04:04:57.244 --> 04:04:59.145]  And after 9-11, he came out.
[04:04:59.145 --> 04:05:00.426]  He was on the Congressional steps.
[04:05:00.426 --> 04:05:01.927]  It was on television.
[04:05:01.927 --> 04:05:07.310]  He said, I think it's those crazy paranoid shortwave Patriot types who did this.
[04:05:07.310 --> 04:05:08.170]  That's what he said.
[04:05:08.170 --> 04:05:10.312]  He said, quote, black helicopters.
[04:05:10.312 --> 04:05:12.153]  He said black helicopters.
[04:05:12.153 --> 04:05:14.074]  There were bombings going on and I said it was.
[04:05:15.334 --> 04:05:17.334]  Uh, because it was a smiley face they were bombing.
[04:05:17.334 --> 04:05:19.795]  I said, that looks like Fight Club, but it didn't matter.
[04:05:19.795 --> 04:05:28.376]  And then I got mad at him, and then I wasn't the Patriot, because I said, oh my gosh, uh, this guy is, is now demonizing everybody he claimed to work with.
[04:05:28.376 --> 04:05:32.697]  And he never mentioned on television, he'd just been about four years on Patriot Broadcasting.
[04:05:32.697 --> 04:05:40.439]  I mean, it was so obvious, and he blamed the Patriot broadcasters for being behind this, yeah.
[04:05:40.439 --> 04:05:42.979]  That's just incredible, and very sad, because, uh,
[04:05:45.421 --> 04:05:48.403]  But that's what they mean for us to do, is just constantly be paranoid.
[04:05:48.403 --> 04:05:53.106]  Folks, you know you're good, you know you're not New World Order out there watching, okay?
[04:05:53.106 --> 04:05:55.387]  Say I'm bad, say whoever's bad, it doesn't matter.
[04:05:55.387 --> 04:05:57.649]  At least you know you're good.
[04:05:57.649 --> 04:06:00.050]  Go out and fight, wake people up, get involved.
[04:06:00.050 --> 04:06:01.371]  Because the globalists aren't as powerful.
[04:06:01.371 --> 04:06:02.712]  They don't have that many agents.
[04:06:02.712 --> 04:06:04.553]  They're trying to create them right now.
[04:06:04.553 --> 04:06:05.533]  But you'll know an agent.
[04:06:05.533 --> 04:06:06.634]  I mean, I've run into hundreds of them.
[04:06:06.634 --> 04:06:08.255]  They say, let's carry out terror attacks.
[04:06:08.255 --> 04:06:09.896]  Let's attack police, Alex.
[04:06:09.896 --> 04:06:12.017]  And you follow them to their unmarked police car.
[04:06:12.017 --> 04:06:14.339]  I mean, it's very obvious to notice these people.
[04:06:14.759 --> 04:06:22.982]  Feds don't get on air and say, you have power, you can affect change, Bill of Rights, Constitution, we can wake up the police and military, we can defeat the globalist program.
[04:06:22.982 --> 04:06:26.003]  They don't get up and explain to you how psychological warfare operates.
[04:06:26.003 --> 04:06:29.885]  What they do is, they come in, and they attack other patriots.
[04:06:29.885 --> 04:06:39.829]  That's always what they do, and they are intensifying their operations right now, because we're, I mean, we have government documents that the army is watching and tracking myself and others, okay?
[04:06:40.969 --> 04:06:58.254]  I've got data as well, data that comes through many different sources and it's the same across Britain, Canada, the US, where they are monitoring openly and attacking, cyber attacks on people who are talk show hosts.
[04:06:58.254 --> 04:07:04.836]  Now, you're talking about the ratings and how they fiddle with the ratings and I use one server
[04:07:05.576 --> 04:07:23.101]  And I know, often I'll put all my different sites onto his server, so it's all drawn off his, and people will email me the next day after my own shows, and they'll congratulate me or something, or add information to it, but that server has a reading of zero.
[04:07:23.101 --> 04:07:26.642]  Zero people coming in to see it, which is nonsense.
[04:07:26.642 --> 04:07:31.444]  That's what they do, they can fiddle the statistics with everything, and just make you disappear if need be.
[04:07:33.154 --> 04:07:37.595]  Well now, I didn't get to it earlier, but we actually have the video clip.
[04:07:37.595 --> 04:07:43.316]  It's up on InfoWars.com of John Rockefeller up there in West Virginia.
[04:07:43.316 --> 04:07:47.557]  And he's openly coming out and saying they want to shut the web down.
[04:07:47.557 --> 04:07:48.958]  I mean, this is all over the news now.
[04:07:48.958 --> 04:07:50.818]  We kept warning people.
[04:07:50.818 --> 04:08:01.901]  Yes, and I've read articles before from mainstream media where they've shown you the photographs of these cyber teams for the military who have been given the go-ahead to attack
[04:08:02.649 --> 04:08:02.889]  We're good.
[04:08:24.771 --> 04:08:50.321]  Well that's exactly what I was about to say and that's now they admit under federal law 96 I reported this five years before it was mainstream news I read the Telecommunications Act that they actually even when they're turned off track you listen to you that you know all these systems are doing it again
[04:08:51.201 --> 04:08:55.662]  We have an illegitimate criminal government that follows a mindset of eugenics.
[04:08:55.662 --> 04:08:58.282]  That's their excuse for all the ruthless, wicked things they do.
[04:08:58.282 --> 04:08:59.583]  They believe they're God.
[04:08:59.583 --> 04:09:03.283]  They believe they're creating the new man.
[04:09:03.283 --> 04:09:05.884]  And it's just amazing what they're doing.
[04:09:05.884 --> 04:09:13.726]  Now, I want to go to some phone calls here in closing with you, Alan, but is there anything else that you want to add?
[04:09:13.726 --> 04:09:14.746]  Yes.
[04:09:18.112 --> 04:09:26.760]  We're dealing with, as you say pretty well, a criminal gangster brotherhood at the top that has had its own way for so long behind the scenes.
[04:09:26.760 --> 04:09:29.503]  They've got everything done they wish to accomplish at that time.
[04:09:29.503 --> 04:09:32.146]  They're coming out into the open now.
[04:09:32.146 --> 04:09:36.410]  They want us to respect them as a criminal gangster team and to obey them.
[04:09:37.396 --> 04:09:39.878]  And we don't have long to go now.
[04:09:39.878 --> 04:09:48.684]  It doesn't take long once tourney's underway and you're used to seeing neighbours dragged off in the middle of the night before you accept that as the new normal.
[04:09:48.684 --> 04:09:52.927]  And then you're too ashamed to participate or stand up for anyone.
[04:09:52.927 --> 04:09:55.109]  You've got to do it now because they're on a roll.
[04:09:56.194 --> 04:09:57.876]  They're deadly serious, and I mean that.
[04:09:57.876 --> 04:09:59.777]  These guys are killers at the top.
[04:09:59.777 --> 04:10:02.919]  They look upon society as just blank faces.
[04:10:02.919 --> 04:10:03.820]  They don't see people.
[04:10:03.820 --> 04:10:11.445]  They see a mass of blank faces that are just superfluous at this moment, and they want to bring the population down.
[04:10:11.445 --> 04:10:18.030]  They've published all their findings over and over and over, and what they do is they don't put any of this through any Congress.
[04:10:18.030 --> 04:10:20.992]  They simply make it happen through other people.
[04:10:20.992 --> 04:10:21.513]  Exactly.
[04:10:21.513 --> 04:10:24.094]  And for all those that are attacking us, Alan,
[04:10:25.246 --> 04:10:36.131]  And for those that aren't government operatives that pick up on it and attack yourself and others, understand folks, that's the mark that we're affecting change, that we're for real.
[04:10:36.131 --> 04:10:40.193]  The evidence is proven by our fruits.
[04:10:40.193 --> 04:10:42.294]  By their fruits you will know them.
[04:10:42.294 --> 04:10:49.278]  You need to ask those people that are attacking us, or tell those that are brainwashing, why do these people only spend their time attacking other patriots?
[04:10:49.998 --> 04:10:53.699]  Because they are feds or federally handled.
[04:10:53.699 --> 04:11:05.423]  And again, it doesn't bother me when this happens because I know that means I'm effective, but I hate seeing well-meaning people not get involved in the fight full bore because they're so busy chasing their tail in these little systems.
[04:11:05.423 --> 04:11:12.825]  It's not going to save the country and the world if we all just police each other and boss each other around and nitpick at each other.
[04:11:12.825 --> 04:11:15.206]  That's the mark of COINTELPRO or mentally ill people.
[04:11:16.400 --> 04:11:23.263]  What we've got to do is get the people to say no to the New World Order, no to gun confiscation, no to national draft.
[04:11:23.263 --> 04:11:27.924]  This is terry that the bankers and the private federal reserve need to be brought to justice, need to be arrested.
[04:11:27.924 --> 04:11:30.045]  I'm risking my life talking like that, folks.
[04:11:30.045 --> 04:11:31.786]  This is dangerous.
[04:11:31.786 --> 04:11:34.347]  We're focused on the New World Order, that's the key.
[04:11:34.347 --> 04:11:35.487]  Alan?
[04:11:35.487 --> 04:11:42.530]  We are, and sure enough it is dangerous because we're trying to motivate people to stand up for themselves before it's too late.
[04:11:43.423 --> 04:12:03.427]  And really, when the people there, our callers, are talking about what we can do about it, one thing that has to be done is that every agency that is private, like the Customs and Foreign Relations at the top and trilaterals and so on, have to be completely disbanded and have nothing to do with government input whatsoever because they're unelected by any people.
[04:12:03.427 --> 04:12:06.608]  They're private organizations funded by the bankers directly.
[04:12:07.308 --> 04:12:09.410]  All right, let's go to calls in the time we have left.
[04:12:09.410 --> 04:12:09.950]  Abby in New York.
[04:12:09.950 --> 04:12:11.631]  First caller, thanks for holding.
[04:12:11.631 --> 04:12:13.713]  You're on the air with Alan Watt.
[04:12:32.168 --> 04:12:33.729]  Yes, hi, this is Abby in New York.
[04:12:33.729 --> 04:12:35.830]  Thank you so much.
[04:12:35.830 --> 04:12:47.996]  I just recently watched Obama's reception and endgame and I finally feel like I have an answer to everything I have been feeling that just was not right in our nation.
[04:12:47.996 --> 04:13:00.503]  That's because instead of seeing all the false paradigm and the distractions and the false template they load into your brain, now you're at the elite perspective from their own documents of how they say they're running the world.
[04:13:00.503 --> 04:13:00.963]  Go ahead.
[04:13:02.352 --> 04:13:11.014]  Yes, um, you know, I mean, we're meant to be codependent to our government, almost in a constant state of reaction to what's going on, but not to have free thinking.
[04:13:11.014 --> 04:13:25.038]  And I realize, you know, I went to public school, um, it starts in public school, you know, don't question what you're learning, don't question where it comes from, uh, just repeat it, you know, up to college, um, I went to a major university in Pennsylvania, same thing there.
[04:13:25.038 --> 04:13:31.080]  And then, you know, you're given, you know, you know, the choice to, uh, join corporate America, or else you're considered a failure at that point.
[04:13:31.838 --> 04:13:34.000]  And, you know, I've been living out here in New York.
[04:13:34.000 --> 04:13:38.464]  There is a youth movement for going against the world order.
[04:13:38.464 --> 04:13:41.486]  There is a developing awareness.
[04:13:41.486 --> 04:13:45.390]  I'm looking forward to being a part of that in my own way out here.
[04:13:45.390 --> 04:13:52.716]  One thing I wanted to bring up that concerned me about modern eugenics experiments taking place was at the university I attended.
[04:13:52.716 --> 04:13:59.462]  There was a DNA project, a mapping project to see how we were all related.
[04:14:00.160 --> 04:14:12.402]  As far as our race and genes went, and this was part of the Genome Project, I participated, and now they have my DNA, everyone else's DNA, who knows what it's being used for.
[04:14:12.402 --> 04:14:20.724]  Oh yeah, that whole National Geographic thing ties back to Cold Springs Harbor, in New York.
[04:14:20.724 --> 04:14:26.745]  Why don't you explain to them, Allen, IBM, Cold Springs Harbor, National Geographic.
[04:14:26.745 --> 04:14:29.085]  We've got to remember, yeah, Cold Springs Harbor was set up.
[04:14:29.705 --> 04:14:53.431]  By the American Eugenics Society, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and Carnegie Foundation, they brought in the census to literally to start a track, the offspring of people, keep their medical, psychological records, any mental illness in the family, any prison records and so on, to see if the genes were asidivous, and they would keep popping up down through the generations.
[04:14:53.431 --> 04:14:55.132]  They were already categorizing
[04:14:55.612 --> 04:15:01.717]  Different people down through the generations from the early, from the late 1800s right through to the present time.
[04:15:01.717 --> 04:15:08.643]  That was the sole purpose of it initially, was to track the genes of the people to see who would have to be eliminated and who would not.
[04:15:08.643 --> 04:15:16.009]  Because they claim that if you have a murderer in your family line ten generations ago, it's liable to pop up again.
[04:15:16.009 --> 04:15:21.153]  So you just can't take the chance with you, you have to be eliminated eventually or sterilized.
[04:15:21.153 --> 04:15:24.936]  That's still the policy that they have at the top today, so you're quite correct.
[04:15:26.371 --> 04:15:27.492]  Alright, thank you so much.
[04:15:27.492 --> 04:15:28.853]  Good to hear from you, Abby.
[04:15:28.853 --> 04:15:29.913]  God bless you.
[04:15:29.913 --> 04:15:32.174]  Brent in New Orleans, you're on the air.
[04:15:32.174 --> 04:15:33.895]  Welcome.
[04:15:33.895 --> 04:15:35.256]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[04:15:35.256 --> 04:15:38.958]  I just wanted to get out one little point.
[04:15:38.958 --> 04:15:46.623]  In mainstream media right now, they're talking about Timothy Geithner being the quote unquote architect of the Bush bailouts, right?
[04:15:50.412 --> 04:15:58.196]  Well, some of them have said that I don't really accept as much higher powers, that they'll never even hear their names at the top to be honest with you.
[04:16:05.762 --> 04:16:09.906]  They're talking about Timothy Geithner being the architect of the Bush-Bell operation.
[04:16:09.906 --> 04:16:11.608]  Oh no, oh no.
[04:16:11.608 --> 04:16:13.389]  I said when they first put him in.
[04:16:13.389 --> 04:16:19.895]  They blame it on Paulson, but meanwhile it turns out Geithner helped write part of it, but he's a high-level functionary.
[04:16:19.895 --> 04:16:25.280]  His father headed up a major foundation that Obama's mother worked for him as his adjunct.
[04:16:26.101 --> 04:16:26.461]  I don't know.
[04:16:41.275 --> 04:16:43.736]  And then the new blame goes on the new puppet.
[04:16:43.736 --> 04:16:50.377]  So this is a microcosm of how they blame everything on Bush, then bring Obama in, later they'll blame everything on Obama, bring in the next savior.
[04:16:50.377 --> 04:16:59.119]  This is all part of the very simplistic bait-and-switch, only one of hundreds of different psychological warfare tricks they play, wrapped together.
[04:16:59.119 --> 04:17:00.319]  Alan Watt, you want to comment on that?
[04:17:00.319 --> 04:17:03.560]  Yes, and all these people who take the blame end up with golden parachutes.
[04:17:03.560 --> 04:17:08.141]  Remember, Richard Nixon left, supposedly, the White House in disgrace.
[04:17:08.761 --> 04:17:15.286]  We didn't know that he was given one of the most important jobs ever after that until he died.
[04:17:15.286 --> 04:17:23.773]  And that was to help set up the free trade system with China, help all the money flow through China to build up to be the manufacturer of the world.
[04:17:23.773 --> 04:17:24.574]  We didn't know that.
[04:17:24.574 --> 04:17:27.076]  That was kept totally secret until he died.
[04:17:27.076 --> 04:17:29.598]  Then he was given a military funeral.
[04:17:30.461 --> 04:17:33.705]  for his role in setting up a new world order.
[04:17:33.705 --> 04:17:37.308]  They never ever fade off and are admonished.
[04:17:37.308 --> 04:17:39.871]  They're always given a golden parachute and a handshake.
[04:17:39.871 --> 04:17:46.138]  And they probably knew a long time before that, look, you're going to take the rap for something, but really we're promoting you to a higher level.
[04:17:46.138 --> 04:17:46.859]  Exactly.
[04:17:46.859 --> 04:17:49.201]  One year after, on average, they then rehabilitate.
[04:17:49.201 --> 04:17:51.043]  They're already starting to rehabilitate Bush.
[04:17:52.012 --> 04:17:58.677]  Okay, and then, oh, Obama says Bush was right, and then Obama will be the fall guy, and then they'll rehabilitate him, and he'll get... Look at Tony Blair!
[04:17:58.677 --> 04:18:05.961]  You know, he's the head UN envoy for the Middle East, they're talking about him being, in the future, the head of the European Union.
[04:18:05.961 --> 04:18:06.782]  That's right.
[04:18:06.782 --> 04:18:20.531]  And so they never ever... They know this, they know it's part of the game, and they take the rap publicly, and meanwhile they have their drinks behind the closed doors, and congratulate each other, and then they're given directorships on lots and lots of board for the payoffs.
[04:18:20.531 --> 04:18:21.572]  Sure, that's how it happens.
[04:18:22.392 --> 04:18:46.793]  In fact, you don't get into the real power elite until after you've been a Prime Minister, or a President, or a National Security Advisor, and then you enter the super-college of real technocrats who then meet weekly around the world to fine-tune their sub-directorates, and that's what the CFR wrote last week with James Jones, the head of the National Security Council that we cover in the Obama Deception, where he says, look, he's there speaking, he goes, where do I follow my orders?
[04:18:46.793 --> 04:18:48.014]  What do I formulate?
[04:18:48.014 --> 04:18:50.116]  I follow the orders of Dr. Henry Kissinger.
[04:18:50.416 --> 04:19:03.887]  Yes, and Margaret Thatcher said in 1990, at Massey Hall in Toronto, her series of lectures across the world was called The New World Order and the coming war on fundamentalist religion.
[04:19:03.887 --> 04:19:08.530]  She said that I now belong to the parallel government.
[04:19:08.530 --> 04:19:16.537]  She said all ex-prime ministers and presidents and top-level bureaucrats who all know each other, we can get the job done, we're not answerable to the public.
[04:19:16.537 --> 04:19:17.738]  She called it the real government.
[04:19:19.246 --> 04:19:25.752]  And they say it on record because Margaret Thatcher will write a book that's only for technocrats that maybe 20,000 copies sells.
[04:19:25.752 --> 04:19:31.016]  Helmut Schmidt, German Chancellor, writes Men in Power, says world government runs everything, Bilderberg Group, eugenics.
[04:19:31.016 --> 04:19:34.139]  I love doing druidic rituals in Northern California.
[04:19:34.139 --> 04:19:36.281]  We do rituals in Germany.
[04:19:36.281 --> 04:19:39.184]  In fact, it's in there on the shelf at the end of the long hall.
[04:19:39.184 --> 04:19:40.185]  I pulled it out last week.
[04:19:40.185 --> 04:19:40.965]  Nobody put it back.
[04:19:40.965 --> 04:19:42.507]  It's on the shelf on the end of that hall.
[04:19:43.047 --> 04:19:43.207]  Yeah.
[04:19:43.207 --> 04:19:43.347]  Yep.
[04:19:59.484 --> 04:20:01.905]  So it's a big joke.
[04:20:01.905 --> 04:20:04.426]  It's like Rothkopf, the former head of the Kissinger Group.
[04:20:04.426 --> 04:20:07.027]  We call him up, he goes, yeah, I want to go on Encounter, Mr. Jones.
[04:20:07.027 --> 04:20:09.748]  And he admits, yeah, we're setting up a world government, but it's for your own good.
[04:20:09.748 --> 04:20:15.349]  And his book, Superclass, he writes an article for the Washington Post bragging world government is good for you.
[04:20:15.349 --> 04:20:18.170]  Yeah.
[04:20:18.170 --> 04:20:20.671]  And it's in the open for those that want to go and read it.
[04:20:20.671 --> 04:20:22.492]  But it's never mentioned on mainstream media.
[04:20:23.399 --> 04:20:27.381]  Yeah, listen, I don't want to abuse much more of our guest's time, but let's hurry through a few more calls here.
[04:20:27.381 --> 04:20:28.081]  Thank you, Brent.
[04:20:28.081 --> 04:20:29.202]  Hope that answers your question.
[04:20:29.202 --> 04:20:36.225]  Nick, in North Carolina, you're on the air with the one, the only, Alan Watt of ComeThruTheMatrix.com.
[04:20:36.225 --> 04:20:40.067]  Bulletproof Global, mega-celebrity Alex Jones and MI6 operative Alan Watt.
[04:20:40.067 --> 04:20:40.827]  How's it going?
[04:20:40.827 --> 04:20:43.749]  Pleasure to be on the show.
[04:20:43.749 --> 04:20:46.290]  I got three real quick ones here, starting with a plug, if I may.
[04:20:47.359 --> 04:20:50.701]  Uh, my buddy and I are doing a site, nwolinks.com.
[04:20:50.701 --> 04:20:53.603]  We're trying to compile the best information on all this stuff for everyone.
[04:20:53.603 --> 04:20:54.584]  Uh, we just need some help.
[04:20:54.584 --> 04:20:58.586]  If you guys can help, uh, um, go to the site, send us an email, give us more information.
[04:20:58.586 --> 04:20:59.287]  We're hungry for more.
[04:20:59.287 --> 04:21:02.309]  So if you guys got deals or anything to send us, please do that.
[04:21:03.035 --> 04:21:07.217]  And then, uh, number two, um, borrow from the Ron Paul campaign real quick.
[04:21:07.217 --> 04:21:10.479]  I got an idea that's not quite as talk-centric, Alex.
[04:21:10.479 --> 04:21:13.221]  Um, we did it for Ron Paul, and I was wondering if we could do it again.
[04:21:13.221 --> 04:21:17.543]  Maybe, uh, have some sort of, um, graphic design campaign for billboards.
[04:21:17.543 --> 04:21:19.204]  Kind of use their, uh, their own, uh, weapons.
[04:21:19.464 --> 04:21:31.769]  Yeah, I've been trying for two weeks, three weeks, just to get a little activist page on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with just a few banners and, hey folks, have viewing parties for the film.
[04:21:31.769 --> 04:21:33.389]  And I'm working on getting that done.
[04:21:33.389 --> 04:21:36.210]  I'm this big global mega-celebrity, but I can't even get that done.
[04:21:36.210 --> 04:21:38.531]  So, I'm being sarcastic.
[04:21:38.531 --> 04:21:40.312]  I mean, literally.
[04:21:40.312 --> 04:21:41.792]  But yes, that's a good idea.
[04:21:41.792 --> 04:21:44.533]  We're also making some street action flyers for folks.
[04:21:44.533 --> 04:21:46.514]  We just don't have the money to buy a bunch of billboards.
[04:21:46.514 --> 04:21:47.675]  What, of individuals or groups?
[04:21:47.675 --> 04:21:48.455]  No, we don't have a money bomb.
[04:21:49.778 --> 04:21:50.978]  Well, that's another issue.
[04:21:50.978 --> 04:21:51.859]  I can't have one of those.
[04:21:51.859 --> 04:21:54.720]  We haven't worked out the technology for that and probably never will.
[04:21:54.720 --> 04:21:57.421]  But we are trying as best we can, sir.
[04:21:57.421 --> 04:21:58.061]  Believe me.
[04:21:58.061 --> 04:22:04.943]  I need people to buy the DVDs at InfoWars.com so I can hire more people so we can do more.
[04:22:04.943 --> 04:22:07.004]  But then I'm too busy giving them out for free to ever do that.
[04:22:07.004 --> 04:22:08.364]  I appreciate your call.
[04:22:08.364 --> 04:22:11.025]  Now go ahead, sir.
[04:22:11.025 --> 04:22:12.586]  Can I ask you?
[04:22:12.586 --> 04:22:13.446]  I've got one gift for you.
[04:22:14.403 --> 04:22:16.184]  You gotta get this guy on Russ Baker.
[04:22:16.184 --> 04:22:18.506]  He's got a book that came out called Your Family is Secret.
[04:22:18.506 --> 04:22:22.509]  He digs way deeper into the Bush history and the Kennedy assassination.
[04:22:22.509 --> 04:22:23.850]  This book is amazing, Alex.
[04:22:23.850 --> 04:22:24.930]  Okay, we'll check it out.
[04:22:24.930 --> 04:22:25.491]  Send me an email.
[04:22:25.491 --> 04:22:27.032]  Appreciate it.
[04:22:27.032 --> 04:22:29.694]  Speaking of funds, I mean, Alan Watt can barely operate.
[04:22:30.134 --> 04:22:36.159]  I mean, I've been able to go around and raise enough sponsors and bust my hind end and get enough money to fund something here.
[04:22:36.159 --> 04:22:38.881]  It's called Men and Powers, a Political Retrospective.
[04:22:38.881 --> 04:22:41.363]  It's in your hand right there.
[04:22:41.363 --> 04:22:42.984]  And so I'm just trying as hard as I can.
[04:22:42.984 --> 04:22:45.006]  But yes, we need your financial support.
[04:22:45.006 --> 04:22:45.707]  I need it.
[04:22:45.707 --> 04:22:46.567]  Buy the books and videos.
[04:22:46.567 --> 04:22:47.348]  So does Alan Watt.
[04:22:47.348 --> 04:22:48.289]  Alan, how do folks support you?
[04:22:48.928 --> 04:23:03.037]  Then you can go to the cuttingthroughthematrix.com website, and they can see there's buttons there, there's PayPal there, or they can buy my books and so on about this coded system in which we live, where literally the language itself is used as a technique for controlling us.
[04:23:03.037 --> 04:23:04.778]  It's psycho-linguistics, really.
[04:23:05.228 --> 04:23:16.036]  Yeah, that's what Orwell talked about because he'd been a member of the secret police in India, then he'd been in wars for the communists in Spain, then he'd lived homeless just to see what it was like down and out in Paris and France.
[04:23:16.036 --> 04:23:20.499]  You can read all about that in To Kill an Elephant and all his little essays, I've read them all.
[04:23:20.499 --> 04:23:31.647]  And then he went to the BBC and he found out, my God, it's a global government, a secret society of eugenicists playing everybody off against each other for the sadistic pleasure of stomping on the human soul forever.
[04:23:32.367 --> 04:23:34.708]  And he wrote that book, and a lot of evidence shows they killed him.
[04:23:34.708 --> 04:23:36.648]  Alan Watt, comments on that?
[04:23:36.648 --> 04:23:37.229]  That is right.
[04:23:37.229 --> 04:23:37.529]  He did.
[04:23:37.529 --> 04:23:44.351]  Actually, he went off to live in a very remote island in Scotland that has lots of adders all around it.
[04:23:44.351 --> 04:23:47.012]  The adder is snake-ray poisonous.
[04:23:47.012 --> 04:23:51.193]  To be a recluse, because he thought they were going to send men after him to kill him.
[04:23:51.193 --> 04:23:57.935]  And he'd always check the incoming boat once a month to see who was on it, to see if it was a possible assassin on board.
[04:23:57.935 --> 04:24:00.156]  He knew, because, you see, he was raised
[04:24:01.977 --> 04:24:05.918]  To work for them, to help bring in this world system.
[04:24:05.918 --> 04:24:10.619]  And many of the people in those days truly thought it was going to be better than having perpetual wars.
[04:24:10.619 --> 04:24:12.679]  That's how it was fed to them.
[04:24:12.679 --> 04:24:17.520]  Until they realized that there was another group at the top running all this and all sides.
[04:24:17.520 --> 04:24:18.001]  That's right.
[04:24:18.001 --> 04:24:19.401]  He was a top socialist.
[04:24:19.401 --> 04:24:25.102]  His family was actually mid-level British aristocracy at the technocrat level.
[04:24:25.102 --> 04:24:29.163]  And he was married in to the Darwin's and the Galton's and all of them.
[04:24:29.463 --> 04:24:30.124]  Mm-hmm.
[04:24:30.124 --> 04:24:33.466]  And his mother was a Bonapartist, they called him.
[04:24:33.466 --> 04:24:41.191]  And he'd been fed idealism from birth, until he realized by the war in Spain, when he was participating in it there,
[04:24:41.883 --> 04:24:50.387]  He realized there was another party running all sides of every act, and he saw the long-term arrangements, and he spoke out against it.
[04:24:50.387 --> 04:24:52.549]  Then the socialists turned their back on him.
[04:24:52.549 --> 04:25:03.955]  That's right, he found out that British intelligence was manipulating the killer commies to throw out the idealistic commies, and they would use them, but then again he was a top propagandist at BBC.
[04:25:05.336 --> 04:25:23.079]  That's right, and he admitted that that's where he learned it, in the Department of Propaganda, World War II, Britain, BBC, because he worked in that department to convince British housewives
[04:25:23.519 --> 04:25:31.404]  But the cheap junk food that we're left with because of the war, all the fatty stuff and so on, was actually better nutrition for them.
[04:25:31.404 --> 04:25:36.188]  And once again, we're using the expert terminology, convincing public that...
[04:25:53.639 --> 04:25:53.919]  That's right.
[04:25:53.919 --> 04:25:55.500]  All having fake wars with each other.
[04:25:55.500 --> 04:25:56.180]  Mm-hmm.
[04:25:56.180 --> 04:25:59.702]  And again, to another good movie, in a comedy fashion, for those who can't follow, 1984.
[04:25:59.702 --> 04:26:01.803]  Brazil?
[04:26:01.803 --> 04:26:02.604]  It's Brazil.
[04:26:02.604 --> 04:26:11.589]  Brazil, Terry Gwilliam put it in a comedy, and at one stage there's bombs going off everywhere in restaurants and so on, and his mother goes on, it's a terrorist again.
[04:26:11.589 --> 04:26:14.970]  He says, Mother, have you ever actually seen a terrorist?
[04:26:14.970 --> 04:26:15.951]  No one's ever seen one.
[04:26:16.571 --> 04:26:27.435]  And the Department of Information Retrieval is this massive, huge skyscraper, the largest building on the planet, because it's all run by information on every individual person.
[04:26:27.435 --> 04:26:34.478]  And then a bug falls off the ceiling in one of the printers, and so they come and SWAT team the dad, drag him away, and then they give the woman a bill.
[04:26:34.478 --> 04:26:37.859]  That's right, because the typewriter went to Tuttle instead of Buttle.
[04:26:37.859 --> 04:26:41.620]  Let's take a few final calls and let you go.
[04:26:41.620 --> 04:26:42.601]  Who have I gotten up to here?
[04:26:43.971 --> 04:27:03.768]  Hi Alex, a lot of people who are new to you will have a hard time believing that these gangster gangsters are scheming to murder large numbers of us.
[04:27:03.768 --> 04:27:10.554]  But if you read Alexander Shosnitsyn's last great book, which is 200 years together, Alexander Shosnitsyn
[04:27:12.352 --> 04:27:30.109]  Yeah, he gaffed all the Jewish historical records in Russia, and he proved irrefutably that 95% of the Bolsheviks were Jewish, and that they murdered 45 million Russians, Ukrainians, and Armenians.
[04:27:30.109 --> 04:27:33.572]  And this is all a plot, and we see now these same forces
[04:27:34.275 --> 04:27:43.428]  The same people are gathering here in the West, and they're like Alex described so poignantly, like Chertoff and all these people.
[04:27:43.428 --> 04:27:48.515]  They're the descendants of those same Bolshevik Jews that want to murder us.
[04:27:49.386 --> 04:27:50.908]  They want to enslave us.
[04:27:50.908 --> 04:27:53.250]  They want to create artificial famines.
[04:27:53.250 --> 04:27:54.851]  They want to murder us.
[04:27:54.851 --> 04:27:56.113]  Well, let me expand on that.
[04:27:56.113 --> 04:28:01.117]  Shultz and Nielsen, you notice the media doesn't want to attack him because he's a Pulitzer Prize winner and everything else.
[04:28:01.117 --> 04:28:06.423]  His book does get into that, but then you have to understand that there was a purge by Stalin against those people.
[04:28:06.423 --> 04:28:10.046]  That's why Trotsky ran over here and created the neocons today.
[04:28:10.987 --> 04:28:21.894]  When you find out that there's another layer, like the Zionists at the beginning funded Hitler, and then made the Jews in Germany and in Poland pay million-dollar fees to allow them to escape to Israel.
[04:28:21.894 --> 04:28:24.115]  They couldn't go to England, couldn't go to New York.
[04:28:24.115 --> 04:28:34.382]  So you find out then, and I'm certainly, it's terrible what went on there, and we're not denying that, but there is a level above that with, and people say, oh, you're just bashing Germans.
[04:28:34.382 --> 04:28:38.405]  No, folks, I'm saying there's a level above that, and I appreciate your call, sir.
[04:28:38.405 --> 04:28:39.705]  That's a great question for Alan Watt.
[04:28:40.626 --> 04:28:42.727]  Well, I haven't heard him asked.
[04:28:42.727 --> 04:28:54.871]  I know you've done the same research as me, and even deeper in many cases, so I know you'll concur with the facts we just stated, but there's a level above that, if you just intellectually are honest, a level above that.
[04:28:54.871 --> 04:29:04.134]  So, when we look at the Rothschilds allied with the British, Anglo-American establishment, telling Hitler to go ahead and invade countries, then setting him up, he lets the British evacuate at Dunkirk,
[04:29:04.654 --> 04:29:09.156]  They send in the Reich Fuhrer, Rudolf Hess, who parachutes in.
[04:29:09.156 --> 04:29:10.937]  You know, the King of England was a Nazi.
[04:29:10.937 --> 04:29:11.777]  They made him advocate.
[04:29:11.777 --> 04:29:12.958]  He said, why are you doing this?
[04:29:12.958 --> 04:29:14.259]  We had a deal.
[04:29:14.259 --> 04:29:15.539]  So they betrayed them.
[04:29:15.539 --> 04:29:19.881]  The globalists betray everyone.
[04:29:19.881 --> 04:29:24.483]  And so, yes, any power group is under their control, whether it's Jews, Germans.
[04:29:24.483 --> 04:29:30.266]  Yeah, they always look for a group and it's a minority that is under some kind of persecution.
[04:29:31.218 --> 04:29:41.269]  And that's the ones that will agitate and stir, and they will use them, and they might use them for 50 or 100 years until they've achieved their objective, and then they'll annihilate them as well.
[04:29:41.269 --> 04:29:42.611]  There's no doubt about it.
[04:29:42.611 --> 04:29:50.579]  I think it's Rabbi Steven Yakov who does a shortwave program at night.
[04:29:50.579 --> 04:29:51.760]  He's a rabbi and he
[04:29:52.688 --> 04:29:55.110]  He really goes out against the Palestinians all the time.
[04:29:55.110 --> 04:29:58.753]  He doesn't hold anything back and he's disgusted, etc.
[04:29:58.753 --> 04:30:12.185]  However, he did admit on a couple of his shows that the Jews that lived in Russia and in the Pale of Settlement certainly fell for the whole idea of communism and helped to bring it into being.
[04:30:12.970 --> 04:30:15.552]  Yeah, that's a fact, and then went after the Ukrainian Christians.
[04:30:15.552 --> 04:30:30.621]  Look, this is Helmut Schmidt, German Chancellor, and you just go to the index under B, and it says Bilderberg 222, and also under B is Bohemian Grove 225, so let me go to 222.
[04:30:30.621 --> 04:30:34.924]  222, this is written by the President of the Chancellor of Germany. 222.
[04:30:38.374 --> 04:30:39.795]  Two, two, two.
[04:30:39.795 --> 04:30:40.976]  Here it is.
[04:30:40.976 --> 04:30:46.081]  And he admits that there is a world government, shadow world government, run by the Bilderberg Group.
[04:30:46.081 --> 04:30:48.063]  I have shots of this in my Bohemian Grove film.
[04:30:48.063 --> 04:30:54.728]  It says Henry Kissinger is a Brigny Brzezinski, William Kaufman, and it goes on to say,
[04:30:56.437 --> 04:31:04.285]  AFL-CIO, Joe Gimini, Lane Kirkland, and it says, basically setting up World Government Bilderberg Conferences.
[04:31:04.285 --> 04:31:11.673]  The Prince Bernard of the Netherlands organized and ran yearly meetings of the London Institute for Strategic Studies under the leadership of Alistair Buchan.
[04:31:11.673 --> 04:31:18.940]  Some of the United States Senators, active foreign, and it goes on to talk about how they're setting up a global government there.
[04:31:20.140 --> 04:31:28.888]  And here is another one on 225, where he gets into Bohemian Grove, a tiny area of the beautiful nature alone.
[04:31:28.888 --> 04:31:38.756]  But you can read, he says, we do rituals in Germany, but my favorite place, we have our own groves in Germany, but my favorite place is Northern California and how they set globalist policy.
[04:31:38.756 --> 04:31:47.464]  I mean, I could just read all this on air, but the point is, there are hundreds of books written by these people, and then the New York Times just a few years ago was saying Bilderberg didn't exist, Alan.
[04:31:48.263 --> 04:31:49.004]  Yeah, I know.
[04:31:49.004 --> 04:31:52.567]  And if it is out in the open now, they don't really care so much.
[04:31:52.567 --> 04:31:57.932]  We've got to realize, too, we're dealing with people who don't believe.
[04:31:57.932 --> 04:32:00.054]  They have to give us any answers to anything.
[04:32:00.054 --> 04:32:03.137]  They're beyond answering to the public.
[04:32:03.137 --> 04:32:06.259]  And in the past, they just ignored the public altogether.
[04:32:06.259 --> 04:32:08.822]  And so did the press on their behalf.
[04:32:09.686 --> 04:32:22.317]  But they're in the open today because they're on a roll, and to be honest with you, they really think that most of the general public of the world are so apathetic now that they don't really care who rules them or what kind of system they're ruled under.
[04:32:22.317 --> 04:32:23.518]  That's what they think.
[04:32:23.518 --> 04:32:30.184]  They've taken apathy to such a level now, and that was predicted by Bertrand Russell in the 50s.
[04:32:30.184 --> 04:32:35.049]  They would create apathy, and once you're apathetic, you allow yourself to be manipulated or controlled.
[04:32:35.869 --> 04:32:47.656]  And of course his quote was, a revolt by the general public, the proletariat will be as impossible and unthinkable as a revolt of sheep against the practice of eating mutton.
[04:32:47.656 --> 04:32:48.737]  That's right.
[04:32:48.737 --> 04:32:50.898]  And for those that don't know, mutton is sheep.
[04:32:50.898 --> 04:32:57.222]  And Rockefeller himself said that the people will come to them with perfect docility at the end.
[04:32:57.922 --> 04:32:59.583]  And that's because they've trained the public.
[04:32:59.583 --> 04:33:01.744]  First, Madison Avenue makes you feel inadequate.
[04:33:01.744 --> 04:33:02.925]  Women especially.
[04:33:02.925 --> 04:33:03.745]  But men.
[04:33:03.745 --> 04:33:09.088]  Men, it's all acting tough and errr, but not being involved in your country or being involved or kill them brown people, that's manly.
[04:33:09.088 --> 04:33:13.050]  But then bowing down to the corrupt system and shaking, you know, the IRS.
[04:33:13.050 --> 04:33:19.594]  Once they make you feel inadequate, then you have no respect for yourself, and then you're always looking for a leader to save you.
[04:33:19.594 --> 04:33:21.354]  Now, again, Alan's got to go in just a moment.
[04:33:21.354 --> 04:33:24.336]  I'm going to give each caller one minute and a quick answer from Alan Watt.
[04:33:24.336 --> 04:33:26.037]  Leo and Mash, you're on the air with Alan Watt.
[04:33:27.298 --> 04:33:29.900]  Hi, thanks for taking the call.
[04:33:29.900 --> 04:33:33.742]  I think the factor we're missing here is the quick gesture factor.
[04:33:33.742 --> 04:33:42.727]  Now, the other day I spoke to Jack McClam and they're talking about they want to shut down the free speech.
[04:33:44.136 --> 04:33:51.363]  I think what we should do is dress up as gay people around D.C.
[04:33:51.363 --> 04:33:52.764]  and go to D.C.
[04:33:52.764 --> 04:33:56.968]  and ask them to ban the Bible, because then that'll bring the whole thing to a head.
[04:33:56.968 --> 04:34:04.976]  But then the media, see they can play those type of tricks, having the ADL and others have been caught dressing up like Nazis, you know, trying to get hate laws passed.
[04:34:04.976 --> 04:34:07.139]  Then they would expose that we set that up.
[04:34:07.679 --> 04:34:12.703]  But see, that's why being moral, you never really have that problem, because you understand the straight and narrow.
[04:34:12.703 --> 04:34:19.027]  Look, look, being clean, not that I'm perfect, you know, I drink and smoke and I try to quit all the time, but I mean, I'm weak.
[04:34:19.027 --> 04:34:27.253]  But the point is, is that I got all these women, literally, folks, and most of them are probably government, just throwing themselves, throwing themselves, throwing themselves at me.
[04:34:27.253 --> 04:34:29.435]  And I know that, number one, I wouldn't get my work done.
[04:34:29.435 --> 04:34:32.818]  Number two, most importantly, I'm married and love my children and my family.
[04:34:32.818 --> 04:34:34.439]  But number three, or four,
[04:34:36.340 --> 04:34:42.743]  You know, morals have been developed and designed because it's what makes you straight and strong and focused.
[04:34:42.743 --> 04:34:45.064]  But the general public is all animalistic.
[04:34:45.064 --> 04:34:51.087]  I mean, I'm more into the stars and space and the mysteries of the universe and working with and helping others.
[04:34:51.087 --> 04:34:52.688]  I get a bigger thrill out of that.
[04:34:52.688 --> 04:34:54.489]  And so you can't buy me off.
[04:34:54.489 --> 04:34:56.410]  You can't buy me off with sex, money, power.
[04:34:56.710 --> 04:35:06.673]  You can't threaten me to back off because who I am and being good and being a good sentient creature is more important to me than all the treasure in the world, which is all a bunch of crap.
[04:35:06.673 --> 04:35:11.775]  So, that's what the globalists hate because they can't control us.
[04:35:11.775 --> 04:35:14.016]  Alan, you want to speak to that?
[04:35:14.016 --> 04:35:21.158]  Yes, once again, let's go back to the writings of Russell and Huxley and others that talked about creating a degraded society.
[04:35:23.874 --> 04:35:27.256]  Promoting sex to the extreme, even though the people would be technically sterile.
[04:35:27.256 --> 04:35:29.816]  He said, Julian Huxley said this.
[04:35:29.816 --> 04:35:31.537]  He said they'd be technically sterile.
[04:35:31.537 --> 04:35:35.158]  They'll be encouraged to basically have as many partners as they want.
[04:35:35.158 --> 04:35:46.263]  In other words, they're debasing us all into purely animalistic behavior, where we have our gratification from our senses fulfilled so quickly and easily.
[04:35:46.263 --> 04:35:51.004]  But the thing is, there's no human bonding involved in any of this.
[04:35:51.004 --> 04:35:52.305]  There's no long-term bonding.
[04:35:53.145 --> 04:35:56.208]  Uh, that was part of it to destroy bonding and fight.
[04:35:56.208 --> 04:35:57.710]  Yeah, it's very, very shallow.
[04:35:57.710 --> 04:35:59.131]  And I want you to expand on this.
[04:35:59.131 --> 04:36:02.694]  You know, in college, you go to parties or whatever, you know, porn's on the TV.
[04:36:02.694 --> 04:36:04.556]  It's everywhere for those older folks that don't know.
[04:36:04.556 --> 04:36:06.117]  It's everywhere now.
[04:36:06.117 --> 04:36:10.301]  And I noticed that it destroyed gratification.
[04:36:10.301 --> 04:36:13.264]  And it actually, like, burns your nerves away mentally.
[04:36:13.264 --> 04:36:17.167]  It makes sure you can't enjoy the real thing anymore.
[04:36:17.167 --> 04:36:18.849]  And, you know, so thank God I'm not into that.
[04:36:19.289 --> 04:36:20.650]  Well, that's just it.
[04:36:20.650 --> 04:36:21.951]  It will destroy the idea of love, in fact.
[04:36:43.877 --> 04:36:44.978]  That's what 1984 was about!
[04:37:00.726 --> 04:37:02.868]  Yes, and it's a science again.
[04:37:02.868 --> 04:37:11.033]  You see, any instinct, any drive, can be by propaganda and repetition everywhere that you look.
[04:37:11.033 --> 04:37:21.140]  It can be made into an addiction, an utter addiction, in one way or another, until people are addicted to having partners, but not to having a relationship.
[04:37:21.140 --> 04:37:29.626]  And all these messages say children are bad, children are a hassle, but then you have all these childless people that are totally unhappy, and the fulfilled folks have the children.
[04:37:30.365 --> 04:37:37.288]  Yes, I was looking at a site recently where there actually is an article that says that children are carbon monsters.
[04:37:37.288 --> 04:37:38.849]  Who wants them?
[04:37:38.849 --> 04:37:39.729]  So that's horrible.
[04:37:39.729 --> 04:37:41.770]  That's a horrible carbon footprint.
[04:37:41.770 --> 04:37:43.291]  Gotta stop having children.
[04:37:43.291 --> 04:37:46.152]  In fact, Australia is proposing a one-child policy now.
[04:37:46.152 --> 04:37:47.113]  Yes.
[04:37:47.113 --> 04:37:50.935]  And again, China was to be the model state for the entire world.
[04:37:50.935 --> 04:37:52.275]  And that's the way they're going.
[04:37:52.275 --> 04:37:55.597]  In China, the government still is a communist-type government.
[04:37:55.597 --> 04:37:56.757]  In other words, it's dictatorial.
[04:37:56.757 --> 04:37:57.778]  It's a one-party system.
[04:37:59.147 --> 04:38:15.457]  They're all multi-millionaires at the top there, and that's what they want to come out openly with for the rest of the world, where there's a one-party system, one boss, they tell you how to live, what to eat, what to do, walk into the sterilization factory and be a good citizen, etc, etc.
[04:38:15.457 --> 04:38:16.698]  That's what they're bringing in.
[04:38:16.698 --> 04:38:17.278]  Unbelievable.
[04:38:17.278 --> 04:38:21.721]  Who's up next?
[04:38:21.721 --> 04:38:22.962]  Alright, John in Canada, go ahead.
[04:38:24.821 --> 04:38:26.702]  Alex, it's great to speak with you.
[04:38:26.702 --> 04:38:32.344]  Listen, I just woke up last week, and after listening to your show, I had to call in.
[04:38:32.344 --> 04:38:37.706]  A close friend of mine at TruthActionOttawa.com told me about the Obama deception.
[04:38:37.706 --> 04:38:41.068]  Man, I've never been scared as much in my whole life.
[04:38:41.068 --> 04:38:42.968]  Then I watched Endgame.
[04:38:42.968 --> 04:38:45.910]  My God, Alex, how could we be so blind?
[04:38:45.910 --> 04:38:50.511]  I've always known the government was corrupt, you know, but never did I imagine it was this bad.
[04:38:52.438 --> 04:38:56.767]  You know, what we really need to do is stand together against this tyranny and
[04:38:57.549 --> 04:39:01.112]  And say that I will not allow my children to grow up and be slaves.
[04:39:01.112 --> 04:39:04.234]  They have the same right to freedom as the Bilderbergs do.
[04:39:04.234 --> 04:39:05.054]  This is foolish.
[04:39:05.054 --> 04:39:06.215]  How can we allow this to happen?
[04:39:06.215 --> 04:39:17.883]  Exactly, and you need to go to your councils, your town councils, and read these mainstream news articles saying children are carbon monsters, and saying your phony environmental movement isn't about saving the rainforest or the plankton that is in danger.
[04:39:17.883 --> 04:39:23.086]  It's about taxing the carbon footprint and the carbon cycle and micromanaging every facet of our lives.
[04:39:23.086 --> 04:39:25.408]  Or point out how they're announcing in Canada and in the US
[04:39:25.908 --> 04:39:28.249]  They're going to put troops on the streets and are now doing it.
[04:39:28.249 --> 04:39:38.032]  If all of you go and create a huge chatter instead of going into being scared, if they're able to cow us and buffalo us and intimidate us into submission, they're going to win.
[04:39:38.032 --> 04:39:39.072]  Alan Watt?
[04:39:39.072 --> 04:39:40.092]  There's no doubt at all.
[04:39:40.092 --> 04:39:44.554]  And you can use some of their own court cases that were meant for propaganda purposes against them.
[04:39:45.174 --> 04:39:50.177]  Because recently an environmental officer attached to a company was fired.
[04:39:50.177 --> 04:39:52.878]  It was such a pain to the company.
[04:39:52.878 --> 04:39:55.219]  And they thought they'd get some good publicity out of it.
[04:39:55.219 --> 04:39:57.780]  But it was ruled in the court decision in the U.S.
[04:39:57.780 --> 04:40:07.425]  that the belief in sustainability and environmentalism to do with man-causing carbon footprints and so on was someone's philosophical belief.
[04:40:08.268 --> 04:40:10.553]  Not a fact, but a philosophical belief.
[04:40:10.553 --> 04:40:15.043]  So why are we all having to give up everything for someone's philosophic belief?
[04:40:15.416 --> 04:40:16.937]  And again, it's all peer pressure.
[04:40:16.937 --> 04:40:18.558]  Sir, good to have you on board now.
[04:40:18.558 --> 04:40:20.319]  Share the gift of information.
[04:40:20.319 --> 04:40:21.760]  Spread the Obama deception.

[04:40:41.934 --> 04:40:42.554]  God bless you.
[04:40:42.554 --> 04:40:43.275]  Good to hear from you.
[04:40:44.015 --> 04:40:45.015]  Hey Alex, great to talk to you.
[04:40:45.015 --> 04:40:45.676]  Alan, nice to talk to you.
[04:40:45.676 --> 04:40:49.277]  I've got a question for Alan specifically regarding Canada's role in the NWO.
[04:41:12.848 --> 04:41:30.528]  I have a friend who is very high up at Wood Gundy, which is the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, and he speaks about Canada as being the administrator of the New World Order and that the Canadian dollar and our pensions will be relatively stable.
[04:41:31.552 --> 04:41:36.397]  Uh, comparatively to the U.S., and also because Canadians have already been brought in line.
[04:41:36.397 --> 04:41:41.102]  I don't really think the Canadians are a worry, uh, for the NWO.
[04:41:41.102 --> 04:41:42.143]  Can you comment to that?
[04:41:42.143 --> 04:41:43.725]  Yeah, I want to hear Alan's comment, then I've got one.
[04:41:43.725 --> 04:41:44.826]  Go ahead, Alan.
[04:41:44.826 --> 04:41:46.948]  Yeah, well, I also know people up at the bank.
[04:41:48.390 --> 04:42:02.553]  Very at the same bank in two and That is what they're told so they do believe that Canada is has the population so Happy drunk at weekends with sports and hockey and all the rest of it that they don't care technically they say it's really true
[04:42:03.266 --> 04:42:03.446]  Yes.
[04:42:03.446 --> 04:42:07.930]  Yes, they've decided to make Canada kind of one of their few safe zones.
[04:42:07.930 --> 04:42:10.732]  That's why they have some of those draconian anti-free speech things.
[04:42:10.732 --> 04:42:11.373]  And Canada is a beta test
[04:42:30.769 --> 04:42:38.155]  of a similar model to England, but even more advanced at many levels, of how to have a highly controlled society without people seeing it.
[04:42:38.155 --> 04:42:39.856]  They call China a laboratory.
[04:42:39.856 --> 04:42:41.417]  They call Canada a laboratory.
[04:42:41.417 --> 04:42:41.918]  The U.S.
[04:42:41.918 --> 04:42:45.420]  is a lab- They have different competing but similar systems.
[04:42:45.420 --> 04:42:47.682]  They're beta testing separately.
[04:42:47.682 --> 04:42:50.564]  I mean, notice Canada is very hard to get into now.
[04:42:50.564 --> 04:42:56.308]  And they check your political background and yell and scream at you, and it's turning into a giant fortress.
[04:42:56.308 --> 04:42:58.070]  And it has incredible resources.
[04:42:58.070 --> 04:42:58.230]  Alan?
[04:42:58.670 --> 04:43:04.504]  Yes, and in the 70s and 80s when I was over in Europe, I traveled an awful lot through Europe.
[04:43:05.106 --> 04:43:10.050]  What astonished me was that each country had its own little, it was indeed a little laboratory.
[04:43:10.050 --> 04:43:12.632]  Holland was testing out the reversal of roles.
[04:43:12.632 --> 04:43:17.977]  They paid men to stay at home with the children and paid women to go out to work.
[04:43:17.977 --> 04:43:28.726]  So every country that you went to, Sweden was pushing sex to the extreme until to see if they were the first ones who would need partners because sex was so easily available.
[04:43:28.726 --> 04:43:31.188]  And I realized every country was being tested.
[04:43:31.528 --> 04:43:31.709]  Yes.
[04:43:31.709 --> 04:43:31.889]  Yes.
[04:43:39.406 --> 04:44:02.684]  And you research enough of this data, you then come up with a prime projection of exactly what they're doing, and then years later you come across a Rand Corporation or a UN document, and it's like you wrote it, because you know you're an intellectual, you've studied it, you've looked at it, and then you already know what their plan is, and then you find actual documents where what you know your understanding was a hundred percent.
[04:44:02.684 --> 04:44:05.587]  And there's only a few people, Alan Watt, myself, and really
[04:44:06.147 --> 04:44:22.229]  Frankly, Alan, when it comes to the technical side, because you do a lot of research, I do too, a lot of other folks are great patriots, they're just not as bookwormish as we are, but I mean, have you had that experience where you know their plan and then later you actually find a document that's word for word what you'd already, with thousands of pieces of data, put together?
[04:44:22.649 --> 04:44:29.595]  Yes, you find many documents often in the same story, on the same particular area that you're looking into.
[04:44:29.595 --> 04:44:41.706]  And I often say that life is boring because once you've understood and read all their books, you know the implementation scheme, you know where they're going, you're never surprised because you know what the next step and the next step and the next step will be.
[04:44:41.706 --> 04:44:42.647]  Absolutely, Michael.
[04:44:42.647 --> 04:44:43.027]  Thank you.
[04:44:43.027 --> 04:44:44.548]  Dennis in Colorado and then Sean.
[04:44:44.548 --> 04:44:45.189]  Dennis, one minute.
[04:44:46.744 --> 04:44:51.286]  Yeah, have you heard of Gene Schroeder out in Campbell, Colorado?
[04:44:51.286 --> 04:44:51.966]  I have.
[04:44:51.966 --> 04:44:53.427]  Refresh me.
[04:44:53.427 --> 04:44:55.268]  Yeah, it's about the war and emergency powers.
[04:44:55.268 --> 04:44:58.449]  Oh yeah, a decade ago we put out stuff exposing that.
[04:44:58.449 --> 04:44:59.750]  Yeah, we've been under the War Powers Act.
[04:44:59.750 --> 04:45:00.710]  It's true.
[04:45:00.710 --> 04:45:03.232]  Dr. Gene Schroeder.
[04:45:03.232 --> 04:45:07.153]  If that were to be reversed, do you think that would have any effect on the current environment?
[04:45:07.153 --> 04:45:07.754]  Absolutely.
[04:45:07.754 --> 04:45:11.856]  You know, they operate by their own laws, and so we're operating under a state of emergency.
[04:45:11.856 --> 04:45:12.436]  Alan Watt?
[04:45:13.297 --> 04:45:14.218]  Yes, absolutely.
[04:45:14.218 --> 04:45:25.825]  Again, everything's been published before by people who stumble across the truth, and you've got to dig up all these books and use them for evidence that this is an agenda, it's a plan.
[04:45:25.825 --> 04:45:26.545]  Here's the proof.
[04:45:26.545 --> 04:45:32.109]  It's all documented to show people, at least for those who can get away from television mentality.
[04:45:32.329 --> 04:45:41.035]  Exactly, they beta test it, like they're beta testing in a little over 50 cities I know of right now, making the cities and counties make you register your guns and your ammo.
[04:45:41.035 --> 04:45:43.637]  And then they'll say, oh look, we tested it, it worked great, let's do it everywhere.
[04:45:43.637 --> 04:45:48.100]  You know, they're beta testing one-child policies through cities that tax you if you have kids.
[04:45:48.100 --> 04:45:56.986]  You know, they're beta testing, and then they admit they're beta testing, and the stuff they're beta testing, they're now rolling out in a year or two, not ten years.
[04:45:56.986 --> 04:45:58.306]  Again, it's very fast.
[04:45:58.306 --> 04:46:00.408]  We're like, everything's quickening right now.
[04:46:01.573 --> 04:46:09.081]  Yes, and also too, you have an international association of mayors, for instance, all the mayors are in touch with mayors across the planet.
[04:46:09.081 --> 04:46:15.087]  National association of governors, county commissioners, county city managers, go ahead.
[04:46:15.087 --> 04:46:20.894]  Yeah, police chiefs as well, and whatever works in one country to an extent, especially if it's profitable to them.
[04:46:21.554 --> 04:46:21.995]  We're good to go.
[04:46:36.935 --> 04:46:37.416]  Exactly.
[04:46:37.416 --> 04:46:38.857]  Let me give you one microcosm.
[04:46:38.857 --> 04:46:39.637]  How do they implement?
[04:46:39.637 --> 04:46:42.719]  They say we got a $787 million stimulus package.
[04:46:42.719 --> 04:46:44.381]  Every other country has a package.
[04:46:44.381 --> 04:46:45.582]  That's taxpayer money.
[04:46:45.582 --> 04:46:50.545]  They then tell a city and a county, do this, adopt these laws, and then we'll give you the money.
[04:46:50.545 --> 04:46:50.725]  Okay?
[04:46:50.725 --> 04:46:53.027]  That's what they call, you know, these funded mandates.
[04:46:54.808 --> 04:46:57.330]  So that's how they have it all unified.
[04:46:57.330 --> 04:47:07.355]  And then privately, insurance companies will say, if you start running checkpoints with the Army at it, or if you start running people through the Patriot Act database to rent a car, we'll give you a discount.
[04:47:07.355 --> 04:47:11.377]  So they incentivize it all, and then have everybody jump through the hoops to do it.
[04:47:11.377 --> 04:47:12.678]  I appreciate your call, Dennis.
[04:47:12.678 --> 04:47:14.139]  Sean in Toronto, last caller.
[04:47:14.139 --> 04:47:17.821]  Yes, hello, Alex and Alan.
[04:47:17.821 --> 04:47:20.622]  I'm glad to finally be on the phone with you.
[04:47:20.622 --> 04:47:22.703]  I just have a comment and then a question.
[04:47:22.703 --> 04:47:24.144]  My comment is this.
[04:47:24.964 --> 04:47:32.729]  I think the most important thing that you've done, Alex, as far as exposure, is the Bohemian Grove.
[04:47:32.729 --> 04:47:48.419]  I think that is far and above the most important thing, because it shows the true level of twisted evil of the most powerful people that are involved in this whole New World Order
[04:47:49.691 --> 04:48:00.897]  Well, Hollywood tells us, I saw The Ninth Gate, I was on the stair-stepper this weekend on cable, and I'd seen it before, so I watched the last hour of it, and what do all these Hollywood movies tell you?
[04:48:00.897 --> 04:48:10.602]  When you go to the big castle chateau in England, or in France, or in New York, you know, eyes wide shut, the elite is engaging in satanic ceremonies.
[04:48:10.602 --> 04:48:15.645]  Well, in real life, that's what they're doing, and why is this from a sociological perspective, even if you're an atheist?
[04:48:16.465 --> 04:48:25.607]  Because they're psycho-killers, they're going to have a religion that matches their flair for blood and death and torture and the enjoyment of hurting innocents.
[04:48:25.607 --> 04:48:26.847]  Alan, what?
[04:48:26.847 --> 04:48:31.188]  Yes, it is, they in themselves, whether they believe in it or not.
[04:48:31.188 --> 04:48:36.430]  Some can believe in it, some don't have to, but they all attend the same kind of orgies, etc.
[04:48:36.430 --> 04:48:39.150]  on that level, where they have drugs, etc.
[04:48:39.150 --> 04:48:42.831]  And even the police will stay wide away, or the police chief might be there in your own community.
[04:48:43.431 --> 04:48:49.800]  And they do have the eyes wide shut type ceremonies because they love to play at being gods openly amongst themselves.
[04:48:49.800 --> 04:48:51.722]  Well it's also about how they're radical.
[04:48:51.722 --> 04:48:57.450]  They'll sit there right in front of the police chief with the governor and just sit there and have sex and drink blood and take a baby and...
[04:49:00.272 --> 04:49:04.894]  I've got the physical will and power to kill this little kid!
[04:49:04.894 --> 04:49:05.754]  Satan!
[04:49:05.754 --> 04:49:10.356]  And again, it's all about they've got the willingness to go to this level of darkness.
[04:49:10.356 --> 04:49:10.836]  Alan, why?
[04:49:10.836 --> 04:49:14.037]  Yeah, what they show to each other is that they have no inhibitions.
[04:49:14.037 --> 04:49:16.538]  That's a must-be to join the misfit.
[04:49:16.538 --> 04:49:18.599]  You have no inhibitions sexually.
[04:49:18.599 --> 04:49:20.420]  That's for male or female or whatever.
[04:49:21.221 --> 04:49:37.749]  And I mean whatever, and that you're not embarrassed by any, you're not inhibited and embarrassed by any particular situation, so you've got to be almost very ultimately avant-garde in everything that you do amongst your own, to show that you have no inhibitions.
[04:49:37.749 --> 04:49:40.610]  Alright, call or ask your question, because I've really twisted Alan's arm.
[04:49:40.610 --> 04:49:41.371]  Go ahead.
[04:49:41.371 --> 04:49:44.372]  Alright, the one question I had was this.
[04:49:44.372 --> 04:49:47.033]  As far as phenotype camps,
[04:49:48.975 --> 04:49:57.362]  Military forces put out on the streets, this type of thing that is horribly going on in the States.
[04:49:57.362 --> 04:50:02.687]  Do you, Alex, personally have any evidence or knowledge?
[04:50:03.260 --> 04:50:07.022]  That that type of thing is happening up here?
[04:50:07.022 --> 04:50:07.542]  Oh, absolutely.
[04:50:07.542 --> 04:50:17.367]  Sir, it's been in the Toronto Star that they've built FEMA camps and they had the Admirals... Yeah, yeah, they had generals in like ten mainstream articles a week ago.
[04:50:17.367 --> 04:50:25.872]  It was like more than ten, saying we're going to patrol the streets, we're going to do cordons, we're preparing to lock down Canadian cities and put people in camps.
[04:50:25.872 --> 04:50:26.732]  I'm going to let you go there.
[04:50:26.732 --> 04:50:28.433]  I know Alan's always informed.
[04:50:28.433 --> 04:50:29.834]  Alan, you saw the articles, I'm sure.
[04:50:30.314 --> 04:50:37.717]  Yes, and I also know that many of the closed bases are still attended and kept up to scratch with empty beds.
[04:50:37.717 --> 04:50:41.038]  And I know where they are, too, even in Ontario and different places in Canada.
[04:50:41.038 --> 04:50:43.999]  And that, again, is for emergency purposes.
[04:50:43.999 --> 04:50:46.600]  Yeah, they broke Canada in five parts.
[04:50:46.600 --> 04:50:49.462]  It was in a bunch of Canadian papers.
[04:50:49.462 --> 04:50:50.882]  In fact, let me give people the exact headline.
[04:50:50.882 --> 04:50:53.083]  We'll pull this up at the end.
[04:50:53.083 --> 04:50:54.804]  Exact headline, there were so many.
[04:50:54.804 --> 04:50:55.404]  Let me think.
[04:50:55.404 --> 04:50:56.484]  One was Toronto Star.
[04:50:56.484 --> 04:50:57.365]  There were some other ones.
[04:51:01.700 --> 04:51:08.706]  Military to take lead role in Canada emergencies.
[04:51:08.706 --> 04:51:10.187]  Military to take lead role.
[04:51:10.187 --> 04:51:14.251]  Another one was, military to patrol Rowdy Bar District.
[04:51:14.251 --> 04:51:16.933]  That was in Barrie, Ontario, and that's correct.
[04:51:16.933 --> 04:51:18.054]  That's what they're doing.
[04:51:18.054 --> 04:51:18.895]  Alright, let me pull up more.
[04:51:18.895 --> 04:51:19.175]  Hold on.
[04:51:24.048 --> 04:51:29.096]  United States, Mexico, Canada signed agreement to share forces during disasters.
[04:51:29.096 --> 04:51:32.341]  And it said that we use each other's troops, each other's countries.
[04:51:32.341 --> 04:51:34.585]  I mean, there's many others, folks.
[04:51:34.585 --> 04:51:36.067]  But there you have it.
[04:51:36.067 --> 04:51:37.169]  Alan Wan, in closing,
[04:51:39.969 --> 04:51:41.330]  What do the elite think of you and I?
[04:51:41.330 --> 04:51:44.613]  I mean, I know I've talked to some of them and they've laughed and said, look, the public's scum.
[04:51:44.613 --> 04:51:45.473]  They want to be destroyed.
[04:51:45.473 --> 04:51:46.474]  Let them, you know, join us.
[04:51:46.474 --> 04:51:46.995]  Ha ha ha.
[04:51:46.995 --> 04:51:49.817]  I mean, that's kind of the attitude.
[04:51:49.817 --> 04:51:52.599]  You can't, you know, evil knows it can wreck things, break things.
[04:51:52.599 --> 04:51:59.464]  He doesn't have to keep all the plates piled up, you know, you know, in a juggling act where you got a hundred plates in your hands and teacups.
[04:52:00.365 --> 04:52:03.246]  They're very puzzled by us because they can't imagine anyone doing something
[04:52:22.139 --> 04:52:22.720]  We're good to go.
[04:52:35.171 --> 04:52:38.892]  And if it's underhanded or crooked, they don't care.
[04:52:38.892 --> 04:52:41.573]  They think that everyone is the same as themselves.
[04:52:41.573 --> 04:52:53.557]  And so when someone comes along and does something for some other purpose, or says it's for a moral purpose or whatever, you're genuinely a puzzle to them because they cannot relate to you at all.
[04:52:53.557 --> 04:52:54.737]  At all.
[04:52:54.737 --> 04:52:58.338]  And if you know your stuff and you know what it's all about, what's going on,
[04:52:59.510 --> 04:53:08.592]  They would like to recruit you and they cannot understand why you won't take the payoff or the bait or whatever and be one of them and live the high life.
[04:53:08.592 --> 04:53:10.272]  Which is actually in prison.
[04:53:10.272 --> 04:53:11.632]  I mean, it's a treasure.
[04:53:11.632 --> 04:53:21.214]  It's so valuable to tie into the life force of the universe, to literally be involved, realizing I'm going to live forever through my progeny, even if my progeny, my line ends.
[04:53:21.214 --> 04:53:26.195]  I live through humanity and I imagine us, you know, really in this cocoon stage,
[04:53:26.795 --> 04:53:31.598]  For what humanity could develop into if we're given time and don't let these elite backstabbers.
[04:53:31.598 --> 04:53:32.839]  To me, it's very evil.
[04:53:32.839 --> 04:53:34.900]  They claim they're elite to suppress and dumb down.
[04:53:34.900 --> 04:53:42.885]  And, you know, I love seeing others do well and maximizing beauty and intelligence and honor and potential and I love innocence.
[04:53:42.885 --> 04:53:49.228]  And they love destruction and power and all the, you know, and indoctrinating the troops into killing a million, three hundred thousand Iraqis.
[04:53:49.228 --> 04:53:51.590]  You know, they love these rituals of destruction.
[04:53:52.330 --> 04:54:11.279]  And I see them destroying their own soul and attacking the very heart of humanity, and so I'm into the species surviving, having a chance to decide what the species wants to become, in elevating enlightenment, and so I don't care if they kill me, because I know I live on, and my only... I'm worried about the species.
[04:54:11.279 --> 04:54:16.702]  I'm worried about the species merging with technology too quickly, losing what our true potential was,
[04:54:17.202 --> 04:54:26.212]  And so I'm almost like a conservator who wants to keep these great works of art alive because they are alive and will grow into something even greater.
[04:54:26.212 --> 04:54:32.139]  I'm like someone trying to maintain the original seeds so they can be planted.
[04:54:32.139 --> 04:54:32.739]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[04:54:33.380 --> 04:54:36.223]  Yes, and evil itself can give you nothing but evil.
[04:54:36.223 --> 04:54:37.964]  That's the key to it as well.
[04:54:37.964 --> 04:54:39.706]  Nothing good will come out of this.
[04:54:39.706 --> 04:54:43.269]  That's an old, old debate in different religions.
[04:54:43.269 --> 04:54:44.830]  Can good come out of evil?
[04:54:44.830 --> 04:54:47.012]  And technically, no, it cannot.
[04:54:47.012 --> 04:54:51.336]  Evil can only spawn more evil and cruelty and hatred and disgust.
[04:54:52.243 --> 04:54:54.004]  Yes, absolutely.
[04:54:54.004 --> 04:54:56.386]  See, their heaven, their utopia, is our hell.
[04:55:21.960 --> 04:55:23.481]  That's the bottom line.
[04:55:23.481 --> 04:55:26.122]  Well, Alan Watt, tell folks how they can support you.
[04:55:26.122 --> 04:55:30.423]  They can go to www.TheMatrix.com, buy some of the books and videos there.
[04:55:30.423 --> 04:55:35.446]  Just unsurpassed research and work, and we want to thank you for joining us for two and a half hours today.
[04:55:35.446 --> 04:55:37.426]  It's been a pleasure, Alex.
[04:55:37.426 --> 04:55:38.727]  Plug yourself, you never will.
[04:55:38.727 --> 04:55:40.968]  Just tell folks some of the things you've got for sale.
[04:55:40.968 --> 04:55:48.691]  Yes, I've got books on, I should say, coding, psycho-linguistics, to show you how we're mocked all the time by very intelligent people.
[04:55:49.586 --> 04:55:53.727]  And you can also buy the discs I have for sale.
[04:55:53.727 --> 04:55:58.449]  And you can listen to my show at night on the other radio broadcasting network.
[04:55:58.449 --> 04:55:59.889]  I wonder if they'll plug me over there.
[04:55:59.889 --> 04:56:00.770]  I'm just joking.
[04:56:00.770 --> 04:56:02.650]  Hey, it doesn't matter.
[04:56:02.650 --> 04:56:04.751]  You're doing important work and that's what matters.
[04:56:04.751 --> 04:56:07.552]  Alan Watt, I want to thank you so much again for spending time with us.
[04:56:07.552 --> 04:56:10.353]  You'll be on with Jason Burmess 9 to midnight Wednesday, right?
[04:56:10.353 --> 04:56:11.013]  That's confirmed?
[04:56:11.013 --> 04:56:11.473]  That's right, yeah.
[04:56:11.473 --> 04:56:13.094]  You're going to be on the first hour.
[04:56:13.094 --> 04:56:14.594]  Alan Watt, thank you for all the time.
[04:56:14.594 --> 04:56:15.615]  Good to have you on with us.
[04:56:15.615 --> 04:56:16.435]  It's good to be on, Alex.
[04:56:17.338 --> 04:56:19.459]  Alright, great guy there, folks.
[04:56:19.459 --> 04:56:23.401]  That's why I have him on and promoting.
[04:56:23.401 --> 04:56:28.883]  Literally, ladies and gentlemen, you know, I'm an adult.
[04:56:28.883 --> 04:56:34.825]  I've stored up more knowledge than, say, a five-year-old.
[04:56:34.825 --> 04:56:40.928]  And I have done the research.
[04:56:45.307 --> 04:56:47.047]  And the elite are like adults.
[04:56:47.047 --> 04:56:49.008]  They are just more advanced.
[04:56:49.008 --> 04:56:51.409]  They understand how things work.
[04:56:51.409 --> 04:56:56.930]  And they have tried to keep the people in like a perpetual... I think there's still a line connected, folks.
[04:56:56.930 --> 04:56:59.671]  I'm hearing... Can we let the phone system down, please?
[04:56:59.671 --> 04:57:00.791]  Thank you.
[04:57:00.791 --> 04:57:01.031]  Thank you.
[04:57:01.031 --> 04:57:03.452]  I heard some bumping around going on there.
[04:57:03.452 --> 04:57:03.812]  Let me go back.
[04:57:03.812 --> 04:57:04.792]  This is a key thought, okay?
[04:57:04.792 --> 04:57:08.213]  I want to realize that this is what is at my heart of hearts.
[04:57:08.213 --> 04:57:14.435]  And we're going to go back to rebroadcast with the Kevin Booth, CIA drug dealing report, and then the police report, and the military spying on us, and all the rest of it.
[04:57:16.747 --> 04:57:20.410]  At my core, at my very heart, it's like this.
[04:57:20.410 --> 04:57:22.111]  I'm 35 years old.
[04:57:22.111 --> 04:57:23.212]  I have accrued knowledge.
[04:57:23.212 --> 04:57:26.615]  It's advancing exponentially every week now.
[04:57:26.615 --> 04:57:35.322]  I look with marvel at how ignorant and shuttered and uninformed and awake I was, say, 15 years ago, when I was more advanced than most adults then.
[04:57:37.193 --> 04:57:40.877]  And I think of the potential I could grow into for all my problems and foibles.
[04:57:40.877 --> 04:57:43.019]  And then I want to see others do well.
[04:57:43.019 --> 04:57:50.325]  And I have a love affair with creativity and beauty and goodness.
[04:57:50.325 --> 04:57:53.088]  And wanting to lift people up.
[04:57:53.088 --> 04:57:56.411]  And because I know I'm connected to the species and the whole universe.
[04:57:56.411 --> 04:57:59.894]  Whether you're black, white, German, Jewish, Chinese, doesn't matter.
[04:57:59.894 --> 04:58:00.655]  I understand that.
[04:58:00.655 --> 04:58:01.996]  I understand the systems of control.
[04:58:03.277 --> 04:58:10.362]  And so I don't get on a power trip because, you know, there's a five-year-old kid walking down the street and drive by and go, I know more than that five-year-old.
[04:58:10.362 --> 04:58:16.106]  Well, I could sucker that five-year-old with candy, you know, and get him in the car and go hurt him.
[04:58:16.106 --> 04:58:24.452]  Or I could go sucker some 18-year-old chick and boss her around and pamper her around and, you know, that's what... But see, that's how criminals think.
[04:58:24.452 --> 04:58:25.873]  That's how criminals operate.
[04:58:25.873 --> 04:58:27.674]  That's how psychopaths operate.
[04:58:27.674 --> 04:58:29.696]  They love tricking a little kid to get in a car with them.
[04:58:30.256 --> 04:58:39.321]  You know, I would love to be able to educate a five-year-old, to build them up, to make them strong, to teach them the pitfalls that I didn't learn when I was young, so they could avoid all of that.
[04:58:39.321 --> 04:58:40.441]  I want to give them revelation.
[04:58:40.441 --> 04:58:41.662]  I want to give them knowledge.
[04:58:41.662 --> 04:58:46.645]  See, God wants to give us, the little commoners, the little, you know, people, that as well.
[04:58:46.645 --> 04:58:50.086]  And Satan, the New World Order, claims they're giving us all this knowledge.
[04:58:50.086 --> 04:58:51.027]  No, they don't.
[04:58:51.027 --> 04:58:56.370]  All they do is actually suppress knowledge, destroy people, manipulate our basic instincts against ourselves.
[04:58:57.210 --> 04:58:58.091]  And you don't believe in the devil?
[04:58:58.091 --> 04:58:58.912]  Whatever, fine.
[04:58:58.912 --> 04:59:01.935]  The group consciousness of evil people.
[04:59:01.935 --> 04:59:03.437]  Or the group works they create.
[04:59:04.813 --> 04:59:06.214]  And so that's what it comes down to.
[04:59:06.214 --> 04:59:07.675]  I want to empower people.
[04:59:07.675 --> 04:59:11.678]  I'm not on a power trip when some neighbor of mine is ignorant.
[04:59:11.678 --> 04:59:13.760]  They may be 50 years old and don't know how the world works.
[04:59:13.760 --> 04:59:20.485]  I don't, I see people that, you know, whenever they, a lot of people when they teach you something or tell you you're wrong, they revel in it like their ego.
[04:59:20.485 --> 04:59:23.247]  No, I'm actually embarrassed for somebody when they don't know something.
[04:59:23.247 --> 04:59:25.269]  And I'm embarrassed for myself when I don't know something.
[04:59:25.269 --> 04:59:27.170]  And I want to empower them with knowledge.
[04:59:27.170 --> 04:59:31.714]  I want to, I want to commune with them mentally, psychologically, spiritually.
[04:59:32.094 --> 04:59:32.575]  I want to build.
[04:59:40.467 --> 04:59:46.851]  And I want to increase the goodness and increase the knowledge and there's nothing we can't do.
[04:59:46.851 --> 04:59:50.153]  I mean, we are made in the image of the creator of the universe, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:59:50.153 --> 04:59:52.494]  And the globalists know that and they're very jealous and envious of that.
[04:59:52.494 --> 05:00:02.000]  They want to hoard that knowledge for themselves and make themselves gods, they believe, instead of trying to empower everybody and moving towards what humanity is going to become if they don't stop us.
[05:00:03.194 --> 05:00:20.079]  And so, the New World Order is like somebody pulling over in their car, tricking a five-year-old in the car, and then taking them to an abandoned shack and beating their brains out, and then reveling, I have power, this five-year-old's tied down, I can beat him in the head with a hammer, man, I've got power!
[05:00:20.079 --> 05:00:22.080]  I mean, it is sick!
[05:00:23.843 --> 05:00:25.163]  It is sick beyond belief.
[05:00:25.163 --> 05:00:29.044]  Alright, I gotta go, my board officer gotta go, because they're running Burmastown at midnight tonight.
[05:00:29.044 --> 05:00:33.225]  The Obama deception is being censored off the number one viewed page at YouTube and Google.
[05:00:33.225 --> 05:00:34.105]  Why is that important?
[05:00:34.105 --> 05:00:39.827]  Because on the front page, we don't just get the choir, or people you pass the video on to in emails, or at work.
[05:00:39.827 --> 05:00:43.568]  We get the masses, the millions that are on the main front page every day.
[05:00:43.568 --> 05:00:45.708]  They've been caught, it's up on InfoWars.com.
[05:00:45.708 --> 05:00:52.490]  We want to counter them by emailing it out to everybody, Myspacing it, pushing it like you've never pushed it before.
[05:00:52.490 --> 05:00:53.050]  Please help us.
[05:00:53.530 --> 05:01:04.661]  Please help us get this out or buy the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it online at super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv but get that high quality because there's all these crud copies out there.
[05:01:04.661 --> 05:01:07.603]  This is the high quality copy.
[05:01:07.603 --> 05:01:10.146]  The best we've seen online for free at YouTube.
[05:01:10.146 --> 05:01:10.726]  Change your channel.
[05:01:10.726 --> 05:01:12.828]  It's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[05:01:13.829 --> 05:01:17.911]  All right, we're going to go back into retransmission, back tomorrow, live, 11 to 3 p.m.
[05:01:17.911 --> 05:01:18.532]  Central.
[05:01:18.532 --> 05:01:22.194]  We did five hours, one minute, and 20 seconds live today.
[05:01:22.194 --> 05:01:23.655]  Great job to the crew.
[05:01:23.655 --> 05:01:26.776]  I'm Alex Jones in the Info War for Humanity.
[05:01:26.776 --> 05:01:38.883]  Kamikazing right into the Death Star of the New World Order in an attempt to ignite the minds of men and women towards liberty and freedom upward and ever onward in this great experiment we call life.
[05:01:38.883 --> 05:01:40.064]  God bless you all.
