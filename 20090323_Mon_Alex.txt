[01:19.160 --> 01:25.280]  on the air I realize that I'm not even articulating properly the magnitude of what's happening
[01:25.280 --> 01:35.120]  in our world today just how real it is world government is openly being announced a world
[01:35.120 --> 01:50.160]  government of for and by the bankers and then I learned Friday that the US military had been
[01:50.160 --> 01:56.520]  putting out my act of type reports it's already been in the news that army intelligence watches
[01:56.520 --> 02:05.040]  bike riding groups pro-life groups pro-abortion groups it's completely illegal they've already
[02:05.040 --> 02:11.200]  merged with the state police and the FBI and they're publicly putting regular army in police
[02:11.200 --> 02:16.320]  departments all across the country as quote liaison officers for intelligence gathering in
[02:16.320 --> 02:25.120]  the local police intelligence files it's like we're Iraq or Afghanistan we're occupied but to
[02:25.120 --> 02:32.480]  then get a internal secret army document where they specifically talk about in the Fed in Texas
[02:33.200 --> 02:38.960]  the protest of last November new ones coming up in April 38 locations across the country
[02:38.960 --> 02:45.200]  Ron Paul was down in Houston protesting the Fed at a park across the street his brother Wayne
[02:45.200 --> 02:52.000]  Paul was with us in Dallas and the great folks that did that and specifically they had the army
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.760]  in plain clothes out watching us now that's the crime that is the terrorism that is the secret
[02:57.760 --> 03:03.200]  police for those that don't know what East Germany was like or communist China still today
[03:03.200 --> 03:09.760]  or what Cuba is like or Soviet Russia I mean this is so anti-freedom this is a hundred and
[03:09.760 --> 03:17.280]  eighty degrees from freedom this is classical tyranny and you know I get up here on air and
[03:17.280 --> 03:22.000]  I tell you about how well we got footage of it how we were followed in Virginia covering
[03:22.000 --> 03:29.040]  Bilderberg and we had guys coming up in the hotel rooms and big special forces tides for 45 years
[03:29.040 --> 03:35.760]  old Pentagon protective services State Department protective services hey let's attack the state

[03:41.520 --> 03:46.480]  happening Alex just like when we put the myack report out it was fake I just made it up or
[03:47.600 --> 03:50.800]  like when I had two months before 9-11 I said they're going to attack the World Trade Center
[03:50.800 --> 03:54.400]  get the word out they're going to blame it on their asset bin Laden oh Alex shut up you're crazy

[08:12.640 --> 08:25.760]  he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[08:31.760 --> 08:37.760]  okay so
[08:37.760 --> 08:45.840]  we know the state police around the country we know military intelligence spies on anybody
[08:45.840 --> 08:51.120]  that protests halliburton or anybody else we know it's all violations of federal law and i'm going
[08:51.120 --> 08:58.640]  to be going over that the fact that they are going after the in the fed organic protest organization
[09:00.800 --> 09:05.280]  and i guess gary francy and others started up another example of good people actually
[09:05.280 --> 09:10.640]  taking action and having a huge effect this is being done because the private federal reserve
[09:10.640 --> 09:16.160]  is a criminal organization that is hijacked our nation and openly brags before congress
[09:16.160 --> 09:20.720]  that they are above the president above the legislative above the judicial and that no
[09:20.720 --> 09:26.160]  one can have any oversight over them and these criminals swagger around washington everyone
[09:26.160 --> 09:30.480]  bows down to them when they go into the committee hearings at least in the past now people like
[09:30.480 --> 09:39.360]  senator oh what's the senator we played the clip senator sanders people like congressman ron paul
[09:40.000 --> 09:45.520]  so many others are confronting them and not kissing up to them and their their aura of godlikeness
[09:45.520 --> 09:54.000]  is beginning to wear thin but just think about how tyrannical it is how just openly corrupted is
[09:54.000 --> 10:01.440]  this that they have military intelligence following us around and that specifically
[10:01.440 --> 10:07.520]  this was leaked out of texas to the libertarian party and we've made phone calls and confirmed
[10:07.520 --> 10:12.160]  that this indeed is going on i made phone calls to the military offices this weekend
[10:12.960 --> 10:18.160]  the number was not listed but i knew where it was based out of fort hood texas and out of camp
[10:18.160 --> 10:26.560]  mayberry austin texas and they were not pleased to know that we have the document it's up on info
[10:26.560 --> 10:32.400]  wars dot com right now because i've been tracking this group for a long time and exactly where to
[10:32.400 --> 10:40.560]  call i had some old documents the fbi screwed up and gave us in 1998 made some phone calls
[10:40.560 --> 10:51.280]  to those numbers as well same offices there's an army checkpoint again on i-35 south of waco and
[10:52.080 --> 10:59.360]  temple belton line it's in police state to the takeover and mike hansons up there
[11:00.400 --> 11:05.760]  doing construction work he sees army checkpoint starts filming it and the local police captain
[11:05.760 --> 11:09.920]  best and others come over and they turn your cameras off and they say okay the fbi is coming
[11:09.920 --> 11:15.920]  two hours later fbi car pulls up says okay here's the press release now stay away from the checkpoint
[11:17.040 --> 11:22.000]  and there was a press release cover sheet stapled to it classified documents now maybe
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.720]  the fbi guy i'm starting to think that there some of them may be on our side i mean we know the
[11:26.720 --> 11:31.680]  state police leaking this to us are on our side we know the army that leaked this is on our side
[11:32.880 --> 11:36.160]  we know that ron paul got more campaign contributions than any other candidate in
[11:36.160 --> 11:43.280]  both parties so we know a lot of them are on our side the majority and you know i'm not stupid i
[11:43.280 --> 11:50.640]  understand i almost don't want to say this on air because i don't want higher ups to realize
[11:50.640 --> 11:54.400]  what's really going on here but i think they're smart enough to know what's going on so it's no
[11:54.400 --> 12:05.200]  secret the way this army document was written is a form of psi op rebellion against the government
[12:05.200 --> 12:10.960]  and i'm going to go over this later in the show in detail it is written with respect it is written
[12:10.960 --> 12:17.680]  for honor of those of us protesting the private federal reserve it is written to wake up the
[12:17.680 --> 12:25.120]  military and police to the tyranny of the federal reserve but it follows its order to liaison with
[12:25.120 --> 12:31.520]  local fbi and police and to at the bottom of the page basically say we can be involved in terrorism
[12:31.520 --> 12:43.360]  so this is a reverse double psi op i don't know the proper term a triple cross on the enemy here
[12:43.360 --> 12:47.280]  now that is not the case with the mike report out of missouri that's the governor admits was
[12:47.280 --> 12:51.600]  written by the feds and it's in all 50 states different variants of it that was written by
[12:51.600 --> 12:59.280]  the southern property law center and adl components of it and that basically the first page says if
[12:59.280 --> 13:07.040]  you have a you know you're a cop killer who is a white supremacist if you believe in the next seven
[13:07.040 --> 13:10.720]  pages that there's a new world order at north american union that the federal reserve's corrupt
[13:11.360 --> 13:18.560]  that is a demonization piece clearly this army report i'm going to read it later here on air
[13:21.520 --> 13:25.840]  you can read it for yourself it's an army dispatched in response to in the fed protest now
[13:25.840 --> 13:30.880]  now ten years ago the military was not awake to the level they are now
[13:33.120 --> 13:36.640]  they were just now listening to us and just now checking out what we had to say
[13:37.200 --> 13:40.400]  since then everything we talked about has happened so we have high credibility with them
[13:41.600 --> 13:45.520]  and ron paul really opened the door and the ron paul movement like nothing else to the military
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.800]  but when i first had run ins with army intelligence
[13:50.800 --> 13:58.640]  it was threatening two different events where i'd walk out to my car in a parking lot and
[13:58.640 --> 14:06.160]  there'd be guys in suits 32 35 years old you know the special forces bearing and they would
[14:06.800 --> 14:10.160]  make little threatening comments and tell me i was being watched
[14:12.160 --> 14:16.560]  hey alex how you doing i heard you got a special team you're planning something you know we want
[14:16.560 --> 14:20.480]  to help you what are you planning you're gonna do something violent and i'm like no no my team
[14:20.480 --> 14:26.320]  when i say i'm thinking my team talking about my people that i work with no we're just checking
[14:26.320 --> 14:32.400]  that out we're just it was another case where an fbi agent showed up he was literally red face and
[14:32.400 --> 14:38.720]  breathing heavy about six foot five that was like professional bike riders the fbi guys you know he
[14:38.720 --> 14:44.080]  was that type and i do a two hour tv show that day and i say the fbi's criminal and murdered the
[14:44.080 --> 14:48.880]  people at weco and i demand you call in or if i'm not a liar and you're not criminals that you show
[14:48.880 --> 14:55.040]  up down here i'm sure enough here's this guy at the door he's got the unmarked police fbi car
[14:55.040 --> 14:59.680]  out front and but he was literally huffing and puffing telling me the fbi wasn't all bad and
[14:59.680 --> 15:04.480]  i said are you fbi and he said well i'm not gonna answer that so you know i had that case too but
[15:04.480 --> 15:09.920]  but and another time in a target parking lot they got very threatening pulled up behind me blocked
[15:09.920 --> 15:17.600]  me in i got out they got around me and i just told me basically that i've i ever got out of line i
[15:17.600 --> 15:22.640]  was dead so you know this is the real world this is this is what i deal with every day
[15:26.720 --> 15:31.920]  the type of crap i deal with i deal with every day knowing this is going on
[15:37.280 --> 15:42.240]  and you know that's when you realize just how real all of this is is when you're in the fight
[15:42.240 --> 15:48.960]  and things like this happen over and over again i was mentioning a few ancient cases but
[15:51.440 --> 15:55.280]  i mean it's on record it was in a score of newspapers that they detained me for 15 hours
[15:55.280 --> 15:59.600]  yelled and screamed at me said i was going to go to prison in canada that was not fun
[16:02.160 --> 16:07.440]  by the grace of god they didn't successfully search all of us and one of my guys had a cell
[16:07.440 --> 16:14.480]  phone he slipped it to me in the holding room and i called the cpc who actually showed up because
[16:14.480 --> 16:19.120]  i was scheduled for an interview with him that next day and by then it was that next day so they
[16:19.120 --> 16:26.400]  showed up i called them left of message and i called jim tucker and he was also scheduled for
[16:26.400 --> 16:37.520]  the same interview so he got him out there but that's what we go through to bring you this information
[16:37.840 --> 16:40.880]  so coming up army dispatch and response to end the fed protest
[16:43.520 --> 16:49.920]  the other huge news is obama supporters unleashed a cell banker plan 13 million of them
[16:49.920 --> 17:02.000]  13 million to quote double their numbers to 26 mil they're going out to get recruits
[17:02.640 --> 17:06.800]  and they're using government paid for psas everywhere to recruit them to the democratic
[17:06.800 --> 17:17.360]  party's private site usaservice.org and this is right out of mausetown tarply always says it's
[17:17.360 --> 17:24.320]  more like musolini and i guess he did pioneer this in the 20s but the way it's configured
[17:25.920 --> 17:32.160]  is malice but certainly mal did pick up a lot of what he did from the fascist in their organizational
[17:32.160 --> 17:40.560]  system but so i guess the root is musolini type garbage but the the the configuration is malice
[17:40.560 --> 17:47.520]  and it's really happening i've got mainstream news reports how they're recruiting americans
[17:47.520 --> 17:53.040]  to be spies and spying on other americans british headlines over the weekend that are up on
[17:53.040 --> 17:58.080]  prisonplanet.com mainstream news just announcing oh yeah we're gonna have citizen spies everywhere
[17:58.080 --> 18:04.400]  looking for terrorist and fighting crime and they've been setting this up in every western
[18:04.400 --> 18:08.160]  nation for decades but now i mean it's really coming out in the open and and they're saying oh
[18:08.160 --> 18:14.720]  this will be the new jobs this is the new stimulus package is a one million person
[18:15.840 --> 18:22.000]  core and there's five other cores but this is the big end and it will be compulsory i mean they
[18:22.000 --> 18:28.480]  passed the draft in the house last thursday national draft is passed i should be yelling
[18:28.480 --> 18:32.880]  and screaming and hyperventilating over that i'm not i've been conditioned to accept it i guess
[18:32.880 --> 18:40.160]  and the language is over setting up a federal agency to prepare the feasibility of force compulsory
[18:40.160 --> 18:45.680]  service and then you read the nexus tie-in a month ago with the defense department issuance
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.920]  and at last not on the show i read that uh army directive a pentagon directive
[18:52.640 --> 18:57.520]  and it says with the new million person force that the pentagon will direct whether they serve
[18:57.520 --> 19:07.840]  domestically or overseas in support of combat operations so this is a giant pool to suppress
[19:07.840 --> 19:13.520]  and control all our towns and cities and states here but also in third world nations that get
[19:13.520 --> 19:19.120]  invaded blasted to daylights their infrastructure destroyed then hundreds of thousands of little
[19:19.120 --> 19:24.880]  bureaucrats come in behind the military to then take over the society and they're going to be drafted
[19:24.880 --> 19:32.160]  but they don't call it a draft they just call it compulsory service mandatory i mean this is
[19:32.160 --> 19:36.560]  past the house ladies and gentlemen this is going to the senate and they're set to pass it
[19:37.360 --> 19:39.840]  it passed by a huge majority in the house of representatives
[19:42.480 --> 19:48.240]  they are really trying a nazi slash soviet style takeover it's really happening everything that
[19:48.240 --> 19:54.080]  was foretold everything they set up was all in preparation of this now we're here now the military
[19:54.080 --> 20:02.000]  is tracking me and following me it's openly being admitted to we're here before you throw away your

[25:29.760 --> 25:34.880]  private federal reserve that tells congress to sit down and shut up that they run nothing
[25:34.880 --> 25:41.040]  sing english words to their national anthem that is uh coming up
[25:42.960 --> 25:48.240]  here's the type of other financial news i have in front of me today treasuries toxic asset plan
[25:48.240 --> 25:54.640]  could cost one trillion the obama administration's latest attempt to tackle the banking crisis and
[25:54.640 --> 26:00.400]  get loans flowing the families and businesses will create a new government entity the public
[26:00.400 --> 26:05.760]  private investment program to help purchase as much as one trillion and toxic assets on bank books
[26:07.280 --> 26:11.920]  the new effort to be unveiled today will be followed next day with the release of
[26:11.920 --> 26:16.320]  administration's broad framework for overhauling the financial system to ensure that the current
[26:16.320 --> 26:23.280]  crisis the worst in seven decades is not repeated the key part of the regulatory framework will
[26:23.280 --> 26:27.040]  give the government new regulatory authority to take over trouble institutions that would pose a
[26:27.040 --> 26:31.760]  threat to the entire fiscal system if not if they fail now they're announcing this means private
[26:31.760 --> 26:37.200]  companies not just brokerage firms banks and insurance companies and then they will set the
[26:37.200 --> 26:43.120]  pay of regular americans and middle class people it's just all the big bankers and ceos they have
[26:43.120 --> 26:48.560]  loopholes that's what they brought out this hundred and sixty five million dollar bonus to aig to
[26:48.560 --> 26:53.680]  divert and distract from the eight point nine point seven trillion nine point seven trillion
[26:53.680 --> 26:58.720]  missing into the federal reserve black hole that kind of backfired though on them because
[26:58.720 --> 27:06.000]  senator dodd and obama were running around badmouthing the the loopholes in the huge bonuses
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.800]  and then it came out that they wrote the specific loopholes so that kind of blew up in their face
[27:10.800 --> 27:13.600]  a bit there with their propaganda but still everybody's focused on the hundred and sixty five
[27:13.600 --> 27:18.000]  million not the nine point seven trillion and counting that that number is over a month old
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.640]  we haven't gotten new numbers yet it's always trillions plus every month since the banker
[27:22.640 --> 27:27.600]  takeover of october third see they don't need any new powers any new illegitimate powers since the
[27:27.600 --> 27:33.120]  october third power grab that gave them unlimited secret funding no oversight total control
[27:36.080 --> 27:39.920]  so when you hear about them saying they want new packages and new plans that's just their way to
[27:39.920 --> 27:45.360]  introduce the fact that they spent trillions and trillions more and then everybody's focusing
[27:45.360 --> 27:51.600]  on this toxic debt asset buyback remember they told you in october november into october
[27:51.600 --> 28:00.400]  or september into october and then into november and december that oh we've got to have this to
[28:00.400 --> 28:07.200]  unplug the toxic mortgages that's the debt it'll be easy to unplug all this and and unclog it
[28:08.960 --> 28:13.760]  and then what happened october fourth after they passed it they said look we don't need it for that
[28:13.760 --> 28:17.760]  anymore the problem isn't the mortgages which it wasn't they just wanted to make it sound like the
[28:17.760 --> 28:21.600]  people had done this they said oh we're not going to tell you where we're spending it though and
[28:22.560 --> 28:26.960]  then geitner got in and he'd actually written part of the bailout so the whole policy just
[28:26.960 --> 28:34.000]  continued seamlessly and so when you hear they need new powers and that there's a you know g20
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.240]  meeting coming up and that they've been meeting in secret that's all over the news that is to
[28:38.240 --> 28:44.080]  prepare the new bank of the world they admit that a new bank of the world that you will pay all your
[28:44.080 --> 28:49.200]  taxes to it will regulate all the currencies and interest rates of the planet when they can engage
[28:49.200 --> 28:56.080]  in more market rigging and more insider trading and scams senator greg says obama budget will
[28:56.080 --> 29:00.400]  bankrupt us the top republican on the senate budget committee says the obama administration
[29:01.040 --> 29:03.680]  is on the right course to save the nation's financial system
[29:06.560 --> 29:13.280]  but senator jud greg of new hampshire also says president obama's massive budget proposal
[29:13.280 --> 29:18.480]  will bankrupt the country greg says he has no regrets in withdrawing his nomination to become
[29:18.480 --> 29:23.120]  commerce secretary he pulled out after deciding he would not fully back the administration economic
[29:23.120 --> 29:27.280]  policies the senator said obama's spending plan in the midst of a prolonged recession will leave
[29:27.280 --> 29:33.360]  the next generation of the country too expensive to live in well that's the whole plan they they
[29:33.360 --> 29:38.400]  want to fully bankrupt everybody and then sign our names collectively over all of this that's why
[29:38.400 --> 29:44.400]  obama's going door to door with 13 million hitler yogan trying to pressure people into signing a
[29:44.400 --> 29:52.640]  pledge that to sign on to it so they can morally claim we agreed to it we're on the march the

[34:05.120 --> 34:10.480]  when they had that terrible mass shooting in alabama i pointed out it was a violation of
[34:10.480 --> 34:14.960]  positive commentatus in federal law now that's in the houston chronicle and other major newspapers
[34:14.960 --> 34:20.000]  the military is investigating a bit violated positive commentatus they've had to have press

[34:29.760 --> 34:33.360]  you have criminal bankers that have completely hijacked this nation they're bankrupting it to
[34:33.360 --> 34:41.360]  consolidate wealth and power even rolling stone had a headline in an article called the takeover
[34:43.600 --> 34:48.800]  in this week's publication and they say it's not about a bailout it's about power and a takeover
[34:48.800 --> 34:53.200]  yeah bring it into me who's left in the other room you're smart to just think of that it's called
[34:53.200 --> 34:59.680]  the big takeover the global economic crisis isn't about money it's about power how wall street
[34:59.680 --> 35:12.240]  insiders are using the bailout to stage a revolution just amazing so we'll be going over that i mean
[35:12.240 --> 35:17.120]  the government is completely illegitimate on its face and they're hoping this obama mania
[35:17.120 --> 35:22.320]  can sucker enough people to go along with it and then they can then sick this mass of 13 million
[35:22.320 --> 35:27.680]  minions and they want to double 26 million and then you so they can point news cameras at millions
[35:27.680 --> 35:33.840]  of people and say look the public wants it when every poll says the public literally 98% 99% are
[35:33.840 --> 35:39.200]  against the bankers but it doesn't matter you got the 2% saying we're terrorists because we don't
[35:39.200 --> 35:49.200]  want foreign bankers raping us financially world market surge ahead of us bank asset plans
[35:50.640 --> 35:55.600]  world market surge on us banking crisis plan japan stimulus hopes the promise of putting
[35:55.600 --> 36:04.800]  trillions of dollars of new monetization out into the world system cost stocks to go up sharply today
[36:04.800 --> 36:14.560]  because that signifies that they're going to go with the hyper inflationary move see they
[36:14.560 --> 36:19.760]  they wouldn't say which direction they were going to go let us just have a recession now and then
[36:19.760 --> 36:26.480]  fix things are going to a long hyper inflationary depression and many fools out there think that
[36:26.480 --> 36:32.320]  that's a better option world stock market sword monday ahead of us announcement to
[36:32.320 --> 36:38.880]  purge as much as one trillion in bad bank assets as japan signaled more stimulus measures
[36:39.520 --> 36:42.800]  to resuscitate the world's second largest economy what does that mean
[36:44.320 --> 36:52.000]  it means the trillions and trillions of dollars of derivatives of toxic made up made off type ponzi
[36:52.000 --> 36:58.560]  paper that they are going to basically put all that on the taxpayers of the western world from
[36:58.560 --> 37:05.920]  japan to england to the united states from australia to germany and so the criminal class the the
[37:05.920 --> 37:16.480]  the looting class the casino class the casino economy class are pleased because for the time
[37:16.480 --> 37:21.040]  being this means that it will probably run the stock market back up which is what bob Chapman
[37:21.040 --> 37:26.880]  and dr paul craig roberts everybody else is sat on this show this is sacrificing the real economy
[37:26.880 --> 37:36.000]  main street real jobs your futures everything huge new tax increases at every level to pay off this
[37:36.000 --> 37:43.200]  debt that is going to be fed directly into the gaping mouth of the wall street global system
[37:45.840 --> 37:49.920]  and so for the time the stock market will be run up again and then run back down again and they can
[37:49.920 --> 37:58.240]  you know manipulate and make huge obscene fraudulent non-free market profits they keep calling it
[37:58.240 --> 38:04.000]  the free market it's not the free market it's a rigged scam and the house always wins the house
[38:04.000 --> 38:08.240]  is the new world order the house of world government as the elitists call themselves they call the new
[38:08.240 --> 38:16.560]  world order the house of world government the house of Rothschild and so they've decided to
[38:16.560 --> 38:22.640]  hyperinflate and turn us into a complete third world nation as well as western europe japan australia
[38:22.640 --> 38:32.560]  new zealand and the elite are celebrating and it's only going to get worse if they continue
[38:32.560 --> 38:42.800]  down this road here's another report out of roiders i am f says cleanup banks to tackle dire world
[38:42.800 --> 38:49.600]  crisis economic crisis dire risk of unrest and war says the i am f
[38:52.160 --> 38:57.840]  and they're what is bush done he said do this bailout or we'll have a depression next week
[39:00.400 --> 39:04.480]  they let the banks take over things got worse do this deep economic stimulus package really a
[39:04.480 --> 39:09.600]  federalization package or we'll have a depression then obama goes on 60 minutes last night i watched
[39:09.600 --> 39:15.520]  it and he says part of his permanent campaign scores of speeches a day in appearances he says
[39:15.520 --> 39:19.920]  look you got to do this we're going to have a depression but then he added oh but things
[39:19.920 --> 39:24.480]  aren't that bad just do this and everything will be fine that's the psychology there's
[39:24.480 --> 39:29.760]  going to be a depression if you don't do what i say and that's this new bank of the world and
[39:29.760 --> 39:34.240]  if you don't like the 190 thousand dollars in debt on each american through the leveraged
[39:34.960 --> 39:38.640]  bailout well you're really going to enjoy the hundreds of thousands of more debt they're going
[39:38.640 --> 39:43.200]  to pile on each and every one of us individually and all the taxes they're going to levy that'll
[39:43.200 --> 39:48.560]  further destroy any middle class or any industry we had in this nation because they use economics as
[39:48.560 --> 40:00.480]  a weapon of vertical integration and consolidation i am f says cleanup banks to tackle dire world
[40:00.480 --> 40:08.240]  crisis economic crisis dire risk of unrest and war i am f the world is in a dire economic crisis
[40:08.240 --> 40:12.720]  but no recovery is possible until the financial sector is cleaned up by the very people that
[40:12.720 --> 40:17.040]  engineered i would add the head of the international monetary fund said today the crisis will push
[40:17.040 --> 40:23.600]  millions into poverty unemployment risking social unrest and even war and urgent action is required
[40:23.600 --> 40:30.240]  i am f managing director dominique strouse con said it's the same old deal past global carbon
[40:30.240 --> 40:36.560]  taxes or all the polar bears will drown total lie past global carbon taxes or the earth will
[40:36.560 --> 40:41.440]  go five billion people will die that was the headline last week by al gore's head scientist
[40:42.880 --> 40:47.440]  five billion will die it's the end of the world depression meanwhile if you follow what they
[40:47.440 --> 40:51.680]  want and you allow them to set up world government they're going to carry out the eugenics operation
[40:51.680 --> 40:57.760]  through release control bio weapon plagues and then that will happen the crisis will push millions
[40:57.760 --> 41:02.080]  into poverty and unemployment risking social unrest even war urgent action is required the
[41:02.080 --> 41:07.520]  i am f managing director said bluntly the situation is dire he told a meeting of the crisis at the
[41:07.520 --> 41:12.320]  international labor organization united nations agency representing unions employers and governments
[41:12.320 --> 41:18.560]  that study labor issues so again give all the remaining power to the bankers for a world government
[41:18.560 --> 41:22.800]  of them for by the bankers and maybe things will be okay and then things get worse and they say
[41:22.800 --> 41:26.560]  give us more power or everything will go i'll get worse and then give us more power everything
[41:26.560 --> 41:33.200]  will get worse then it gets worse strouse con was talking less than two weeks before a summit of the
[41:33.200 --> 41:39.120]  g20 leading nations on april second to tackle the crisis as the crisis spills over into developed
[41:39.120 --> 41:45.840]  countries millions of people will be pushed back into poverty and hardship strouse con said all
[41:45.840 --> 41:50.800]  this will affect dramatically unemployment and beyond unemployment for many countries it will be
[41:50.800 --> 41:56.960]  at the roots of social unrest some threat to democracy may be from social cases it can also
[41:56.960 --> 42:03.120]  end in war he said he confirmed the imf would shortly debate its economic forecast to show
[42:03.120 --> 42:08.800]  the world economy contracting between 0.5 and 1 in the year the first reversal in more than 50
[42:08.800 --> 42:16.880]  years of sustained growth developed countries would shrink by a post cold war record post war
[42:16.880 --> 42:21.760]  record of world war two about three percent he said but the imf still believe recovery was possible
[42:21.760 --> 42:27.280]  in 2010 provided bold policies were followed and that means doing whatever they say so
[42:28.640 --> 42:35.040]  we are now here with the open world government of four and by the bankers being set up
[42:35.040 --> 42:40.320]  in plain view of everyone and if you go protest that the private fellow deserve is owned by
[42:40.320 --> 42:46.000]  european new york and london families the army is spying on you and watching you now
[42:46.000 --> 42:52.320]  we can't let that be a chilling effect and stop us it just shows how a pack of criminals is attempting
[42:52.320 --> 42:56.400]  to take this country over like they did germany russia china and hundreds of other countries
[42:58.400 --> 43:03.360]  this is what the imf and world bank and xm bank international bank of settlements the oecd this
[43:03.360 --> 43:12.480]  is what this this this group of criminals do their monopoly men they set up north com to protect
[43:12.480 --> 43:17.440]  their criminal operation from the american people ever getting control the government again
[43:17.440 --> 43:22.320]  and then having legitimate government not rogue government but legitimate government
[43:22.320 --> 43:28.800]  prosecute these globalists see that's what tyranny is they've got to get their crime syndicate in
[43:28.800 --> 43:35.600]  place so they can consolidate the power their conquerors their usurpers this is military and
[43:35.600 --> 43:46.080]  economic domination this is the fall of the republic a decade down the road you'll still
[43:46.080 --> 43:51.120]  see the american flag you'll still hear about how we're the home of the free land of the brave
[43:51.120 --> 43:53.520]  land of the free home of the brave but it will not be that case
[43:56.480 --> 44:00.080]  you think your standard of living has dropped so far it's only going to get worse until these
[44:00.080 --> 44:09.600]  criminals are brought to justice and the imf goes on to set in a world regulatory body with
[44:09.600 --> 44:16.000]  absolute control over every nation's issuance of currency the value of currencies interest rates
[44:16.000 --> 44:20.480]  everything you'll still have your dollars you'll still have your yin and yang you'll still have
[44:20.480 --> 44:26.000]  your pounds you'll still have your euros you'll still have your pesos but it will globally be set
[44:26.000 --> 44:31.200]  and controlled by this body just like trade is set by the world trade organization
[44:34.400 --> 44:38.560]  here's the times of london headlines soon there will be nobody left to lend to america
[44:42.560 --> 44:46.240]  that's what the national post in canada's headline was yesterday it was
[44:46.240 --> 44:56.960]  is this the end of america yes it is it is the end of the united states as we know it
[44:56.960 --> 45:02.720]  they are using up all of our capital they're indenturing the american people to finance
[45:02.720 --> 45:08.960]  the global banking takeover of the entire planet and then we are left as poppers on the continent
[45:08.960 --> 45:18.480]  our forefathers conquered in the words of thomas jefferson you understand this is it but you've
[45:18.480 --> 45:30.000]  got a entitled slack job public who have had it so good we're all soft we're all too complacent
[45:30.000 --> 45:38.240]  myself included we have had it good so long that we don't know what hardship is and the the the
[45:38.240 --> 45:43.680]  the public was taught that it was cute and funny and cool to be lackadaisical and laugh in the face
[45:43.680 --> 45:48.640]  of serious issues and that everybody was just partying and drinking and working out and having
[45:48.640 --> 45:54.320]  sex and going on vacations and smirking or caught up at the left right paradigm if you were politically
[45:54.320 --> 46:03.120]  active while the bankers while powerful serious shrewd focused eugenics obsessed control freaks
[46:03.120 --> 46:09.200]  got us in debt took over our local governments brainwashed our police and military and now
[46:09.200 --> 46:14.720]  they're dropping the hammer the hammers already hit and now they're raising it again to just
[46:15.520 --> 46:26.320]  hammer hammer hammer hammer hammer hammer hammer we're like a ship going into a hurricane
[46:26.320 --> 46:32.960]  a cyclone it's 200 miles an hour and people are being slammed up and up against the bulkhead doors
[46:32.960 --> 46:38.000]  and they're still giggling and smirking and we haven't even entered the main maelstrom yet
[46:42.320 --> 46:46.800]  and i am desperately trying to get the american people to rise up and take the wheel away from
[46:46.800 --> 46:53.520]  the psychopaths that are in control of the ship but the wicked captains at the helm saying look
[46:53.520 --> 46:59.200]  just shut up he's an extremist they're extremists let me continue taking the ship directly into
[46:59.200 --> 47:05.120]  the storm and that's why the elite don't care they've now brought us into the storm
[47:05.120 --> 47:10.240]  they are either going to fail and their new world order system is going to be run up on the rocks
[47:11.440 --> 47:18.080]  and then we've got some chance of climbing off and surviving maybe or they are going to continue
[47:18.080 --> 47:20.720]  taking us directly in and taking the ship to the bottom
[47:20.720 --> 47:30.560]  and all i'm trying to do is get people to wake up and realize how desperate the situation is the
[47:30.560 --> 47:36.720]  public is is outraged over 165 million dollars to aig when it's the third round of bonuses
[47:36.720 --> 47:41.360]  for that one group there's hundreds of groups getting bonuses and bailout money 250 billion
[47:41.360 --> 47:51.920]  dollars cbs news reports of bailout money is in the is just in one tax shelter alone you know in
[47:51.920 --> 48:01.840]  the camons that is nothing it isn't the little ceo's it's the shareholders of the big private
[48:01.840 --> 48:07.040]  banks and brokerage houses that in the last decade have gotten you to buy in the ponzi schemes while
[48:07.040 --> 48:14.960]  they move their assets into coal mines and power plants and roads and biotech and defense
[48:14.960 --> 48:21.360]  and media they when they built the ponzi scheme they took all their money out i saw this a decade
[48:21.360 --> 48:28.720]  ago and would only buy hard assets and commodities while selling you into the ponzi scheme with

[54:42.800 --> 54:48.320]  that's how this works i got on the stair stepper this morning and for about the fifth time it was
[54:48.320 --> 54:55.680]  on hbo and i watched about an hour of it of serenity you know with the case of the cia agent mr
[54:55.680 --> 55:02.560]  bear and it's a true story uh people in the cia all these young punks they're hiring they're tripling
[55:02.560 --> 55:06.720]  as best we can tell it's secret but they meant they've tripled the funding for hiring personnel
[55:06.720 --> 55:12.720]  domestically and internationally and they're running cia ads on radio tv everywhere and all
[55:12.720 --> 55:16.800]  these people being recruited in they're really lowering their standards because they want idiots
[55:17.680 --> 55:22.480]  you know bear was one of the top field officers they had and very intelligent you know 160 iq
[55:22.480 --> 55:25.760]  and they tried to set him up they will set you up dummies
[55:28.800 --> 55:32.480]  you know i was talking to my uh i'm not gonna say what i was talking to family
[55:32.480 --> 55:36.720]  and this is the kind of stuff you learn once you make films like i've made and do the things
[55:37.440 --> 55:41.280]  that i've done then older family i'll just leave it at that
[55:42.960 --> 55:49.760]  will open up to you and uh i have a living relative he's very old he was an army officer
[55:50.400 --> 55:55.200]  for 20 something years and then they recruited him for the cia and they said okay this is your
[55:55.200 --> 56:02.400]  graduation as a full officer uh in black ops and they sent him to chicago to do things he
[56:02.400 --> 56:09.360]  said that he couldn't do and i said what is that and he said well i i can't tell you but it was
[56:09.360 --> 56:14.560]  narcotics trafficking now that was in the 70s ladies and gentlemen
[56:18.880 --> 56:20.480]  that's what the cia is
[56:22.640 --> 56:28.640]  it's narcotics it's everything else you can imagine evil i've played here on air house
[56:28.640 --> 56:33.520]  armed services committee hearings where they say to donald rumsfeld the million plus kidnapped
[56:33.520 --> 56:37.840]  children out of europe where are they why are you lying dying court to do this they then changed
[56:37.840 --> 56:41.840]  their name and he's and why are you still giving them bids and contracts and he said well they're
[56:41.840 --> 56:46.800]  allowed to do that you know they got put in the penalty box for a year and now they're now now
[56:46.800 --> 56:53.280]  we're giving them contracts i mean it's just out in the open it's so evil though that people have
[56:53.280 --> 56:59.360]  trouble imagining or even dealing with it i have trouble i was in the shower this morning just thinking
[56:59.360 --> 57:04.320]  i was like my god they're they're so evil and then they wrapped themselves in the american flag and
[57:04.320 --> 57:08.320]  they say they're doing it for goodness and and you know and they've got it all compartmentalized
[57:08.320 --> 57:13.360]  and they get all these farm boys to go join special forces and they recruit them into cia
[57:13.360 --> 57:16.320]  and they have them running around committing murders in the third world and they bring them
[57:16.320 --> 57:20.800]  back here and have them deal drugs and murder people and i know one day it's a good chance
[57:20.800 --> 57:26.480]  well they're going to come for me but they've already are all over me but it's just it's
[57:26.480 --> 57:31.600]  sick and i'm even worried about dying it's just so disgusting that our country had to be completely
[57:31.600 --> 57:36.800]  taken over by criminals and now they're blowing out stealing everybody's pension funds and 401ks
[57:36.800 --> 57:42.000]  in front of everybody and we just go down and peaceably assemble and protest the federal reserve
[57:42.000 --> 57:46.720]  and say forget about obama forget about bush this is the real power structure while the army is
[57:46.720 --> 57:54.000]  watching us i mean i have their own internal report right here that is high treason you are you are
[57:54.000 --> 57:57.840]  destroying the country completely then that's the thing about corruption you know first they get
[57:57.840 --> 58:02.080]  them to commit corrupt acts in the fifties and sixties overseas then they start committing
[58:02.080 --> 58:08.960]  corrupt acts here and now it's just corrupt acts everywhere and you know nine out of ten people
[58:08.960 --> 58:13.760]  in the army that's where they mainly recruit say no when they finally find out it's drug dealing
[58:13.760 --> 58:19.680]  and they imprison them or they kill them you know like terry reade they try to go after countless
[58:19.680 --> 58:30.960]  others celica stillo but that 10 they say you know what absolutely absolutely i'll deal drugs

[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:49.200]  the secret miak report that we broke two weeks ago now international news and a new army report
[1:00:49.200 --> 1:00:54.960]  specifically naming our protest in dallas against the private federal reserve in november
[1:00:54.960 --> 1:01:00.000]  and the fact that this was leaked to us is an indicator of how upset the military and police
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:04.720]  are about what's happening military police and others continue to leak this to us the
[1:01:04.720 --> 1:01:12.640]  libertarian party whoever just get the information out to everybody speaking of cia and black ops
[1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:19.600]  freeway ricky ross was at the time the largest distributor of cocaine
[1:01:19.600 --> 1:01:24.400]  when the two-day period sometimes in as much as 25 million dollars will be distributed
[1:01:25.440 --> 1:01:29.200]  through southern california to the west coast out to chicago and then across the nation the
[1:01:29.200 --> 1:01:34.560]  cia directly was bringing it in this came out in congressional testimony with a cia solicitor general
[1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:40.080]  on c span in 1996 kevin muth made a film about this five years in the making and i consulted on
[1:01:40.080 --> 1:01:44.880]  american drug war we have it available at info wars dot com it also was aired over and over again
[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:51.440]  and as an award-winning film on showtime now free ricky ross is already supposed to be out of
[1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:57.840]  prison basically and they're not doing that remember back in 1999 a federal judge ruled the
[1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:05.840]  dividends had to be released from prison they had been found not guilty of murder but then the judge
[1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:10.480]  waltry smith in the criminal trial he also sat over the civil that was a violation of constitution
[1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:15.840]  he said well i find you guilty of using weapons in the commission of a murder but you have to
[1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:21.120]  be found guilty of the murder first put them in jail for 45 years apiece with 43 and 45 years
[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:25.200]  where the sentences a whole bunch of the branch of idiots and survivors of that delta force attack
[1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:28.480]  always goes back to the special combat applications group
[1:02:31.200 --> 1:02:40.240]  the shadow government and uh they serve six and seven years after federal judges ordered
[1:02:40.240 --> 1:02:47.040]  them released they just don't care and so we're here to talk about that specifically today and i'm
[1:02:47.040 --> 1:02:52.240]  you know kevin has gone and interviewed ricky ross in prison very hard to do then when um
[1:02:53.200 --> 1:02:57.040]  we did air that here first i appreciate kevin putting that out a few years ago here first
[1:02:57.040 --> 1:03:00.640]  he was supposed to be out so i'm going to bring kevin booth up in the next segment i'll bring in
[1:03:02.240 --> 1:03:07.040]  the head of the company that here ricky ross is going to put a reality tv show together with
[1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:16.000]  and that straw who was incarcerated along with uh rick for heroin distribution for several years
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:22.560]  and is now the president of freeway enterprises and monique hall radio talk show host and
[1:03:22.560 --> 1:03:27.120]  author award-winning author who are working on this case i want to bring up kevin booth right
[1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:33.440]  now kevin uh i tell you i'm not surprised they're not letting him out yeah now it's uh
[1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:39.040]  uh they just seemed too good to be true i i was uh out of the out of the blue got a call
[1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:45.440]  from rick saying that he was going to have a new sentencing hearing in uh early february we
[1:03:45.440 --> 1:03:50.960]  we uh went to san diego with a film crew and it was amazing because i was at a sentencing hearing
[1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:57.360]  a couple years ago when the federal prosecutor came in there and they they they brought ricky in
[1:03:57.360 --> 1:04:02.800]  and shackles he had been held in a little cage for several weeks and he looked like he had been
[1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:07.840]  all beaten up and the prosecutors sat there and hammered on him and every the judge hammered on
[1:04:07.840 --> 1:04:14.160]  him and then they just kind of carted him away but that was back in 2005 and my understanding from
[1:04:14.160 --> 1:04:20.640]  that hearing was that it was supposed to be like another maximum of another two years okay so 2007
[1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:26.320]  comes and goes 2008 comes and goes so 2009 rolls around he has another resentencing hearing
[1:04:26.320 --> 1:04:32.160]  i was there in person once again the judge says that ricky can go to a halfway house on march
[1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:38.000]  29th and now with uh two weeks we're getting ready to pack up to start shooting this reality show
[1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:44.640]  uh suddenly the warden lost the paperwork or something until kevin look he's kevin he's
[1:04:44.640 --> 1:04:49.120]  not going to make it out of there alive unless you guys for now let's catch out of the bag stop
[1:04:49.120 --> 1:04:54.400]  talking about the reality tv show man that's the whole reason uh i mean i'm glad he's going to do it
[1:04:54.400 --> 1:04:59.520]  then and it's good to now be public since the horse has already left the barn but stay there

[1:08:08.880 --> 1:08:17.520]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network just a program though the obama deception has now been
[1:08:17.520 --> 1:08:24.160]  out for about 10 days it is the number one video on youtube and google though they removed it from
[1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:29.840]  the number one viewed page but you can they've also removed the honors from the channels that have
[1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:34.880]  posted it that way they knock it off the front pages but if you look at the number of views each
[1:08:34.880 --> 1:08:40.720]  day it's it would be number one there's some up there with over a million views others up there
[1:08:40.720 --> 1:08:46.480]  with a half a million views four hundred and something thousand views i've seen just on youtube
[1:08:46.480 --> 1:08:50.800]  alone probably 15 different copies that have over a hundred thousand views apiece so millions and
[1:08:50.800 --> 1:08:55.200]  millions and millions of free views of my new film the obama deception showing how he works for the
[1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:59.280]  very same bankers the controlled bush and it's just their frontman that they plan to basically
[1:08:59.280 --> 1:09:03.840]  politically destroy him like they're already doing geithner after he's done his work he's meant to take
[1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:09.920]  the blame for the globalist agenda now i'm asking all the listeners to get the obama deception out
[1:09:09.920 --> 1:09:16.640]  to everybody i got thousands of them sitting out there on a palette of the high quality dvd with
[1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:21.520]  the extras this film needs to be seen order it at info wars dot com that also supports us the
[1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:26.800]  filmmakers but there's many versions up on the web for free the best one is change the channel
[1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:30.960]  change dot channel is the name of the handle of the site that did the best in code for free
[1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:37.040]  for free it's amazingly clear for youtube and it's got four hundred and fifty something thousand
[1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:42.160]  views it's getting about sixty seventy thousand views a day that is not enough all the cruddy
[1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:46.560]  copies are getting more views than that i wanted to be the number one link when you type obama
[1:09:46.560 --> 1:09:52.560]  deception into google it's the third link right now says obama deception in high quality is the
[1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:56.800]  name of it so if you google that you find it but i'm gonna have curtain memo and paul watson posted
[1:09:56.800 --> 1:10:03.280]  at the top of info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and i want everybody today to launch it to
[1:10:03.280 --> 1:10:07.840]  explain to people it's being censored that needs to be a little blurb above the free posting of it
[1:10:08.640 --> 1:10:13.440]  and see it in the highest quality online at prison planet dot tv got a 15-cent a day membership
[1:10:13.440 --> 1:10:18.560]  we somal cast the last two hours of the show every day at prison planet dot tv visually in the tv
[1:10:18.560 --> 1:10:23.360]  studio and jason bermus nine at midnight is three hours out of the studio somal cast lorario with
[1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:28.480]  genesis so another reason to be a prison planet dot tv member 15 cents a day now going back to kevin
[1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:33.440]  booth filmmaker kevin i'm and to be clear we got caught off by the break i'm not criticizing
[1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:37.440]  the fact that ricky saying he's going to do this and you guys are doing that i mean that's no secret
[1:10:37.440 --> 1:10:43.120]  my whole point is in a way him being public gives him some safety but then in a way being public
[1:10:43.120 --> 1:10:48.320]  also makes them go after him and mistreat him as you know so it's kind of a catch 22 why was the
[1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:53.440]  decision made to go ahead and announce i guess in the last year so that you guys are gonna do a
[1:10:53.440 --> 1:10:57.040]  reality tv show you know your phones are tapped you've seen guys out there messing with your
[1:10:57.040 --> 1:11:02.560]  phone box i mean that's obvious all of i mean why was that decision made well i mean you gotta
[1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:07.120]  know that the reality show is just the tip of the spear i mean and ricky everybody should check out
[1:11:07.120 --> 1:11:12.880]  freeway enterprises dot com it's a new social networking site started by his team i mean ricky
[1:11:12.880 --> 1:11:18.640]  is going to be starting a record company a movie company a whole new multimedia conglomerate
[1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:22.720]  and what makes ricky so important right now is that i mean you're talking about your last segment
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:26.800]  that you know you know we should be trying to get the american people to take the wheel away
[1:11:26.800 --> 1:11:32.400]  from the criminals ricky is like a major icon of the streets and i think the government is
[1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:37.680]  basically afraid because ricky could be a new type of leader now and part of the show is going to be
[1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:42.480]  him showing that he can raise a million dollars in today's economy but not being a part of like
[1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:46.800]  this whole corrupt system that that that's going on right now and then give them the reality show
[1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:51.120]  is just going to document what he's doing he's already got this huge other thing going that i'm
[1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:55.840]  not a part of i'm just a fly on the wall no i don't know i would even talk about the show
[1:11:55.840 --> 1:12:00.080]  specifically i mean the fact that he's being so public about how he's going to basically
[1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:05.280]  expose the whole corrupt system he's got to know that they're going to go after him even more then
[1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:11.440]  i mean i'm commending his courage i'm just saying yeah that's the big issue here uh so and i i mean
[1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:15.280]  i'm not even saying it's a bad thing that he's being public i'm saying talking to him and others
[1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:21.360]  what's the catch 22 here of damned if you do damned if you don't yeah no no i mean but but what
[1:12:21.360 --> 1:12:26.320]  what else is he gonna do right i mean uh he's he's gotta go public with this thing or else they'll
[1:12:26.320 --> 1:12:30.960]  just keep him in the hole forever i mean right now we've got maxine waters working on it i was
[1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:36.240]  hoping maybe ron paul could maybe put in a phone call or if any of your listeners have any sort of
[1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:42.240]  inroads to the bureau of prisons you know i mean this is just like dealing with a brick wall dealing
[1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:45.280]  with this bureau of prisons yeah they move him around i want to go to some of the other folks
[1:12:45.280 --> 1:12:50.400]  here in a minute we'll hold you past 30 minute mark if we need to but but specifically uh he's
[1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:54.320]  supposed to go to a halfway house it hasn't happened what they claim they've lost the paperwork how
[1:12:54.320 --> 1:12:59.120]  long can that go on yeah you know another 90 days or something like that they could probably drag
[1:12:59.120 --> 1:13:05.280]  this out till september if they wanted to you know it is just crazy i mean he's gonna be moved to a
[1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:10.960]  halfway house in san diego because that's where this last crime happened and and what i learned
[1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:16.480]  from this too is that i had no idea that judges it's just up to a judge's personal discretion
[1:13:16.480 --> 1:13:22.320]  whether they want to like dole out concurrent or consecutive um you know punishment and so
[1:13:22.320 --> 1:13:27.200]  one of the things that's been holding them in all this time is that they were punishing them on
[1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:33.280]  consecutive sentences because he had different cases uh one in ohio one in san diego one in
[1:13:33.280 --> 1:13:38.240]  los angeles all these different cases working against them and so his lawyer finally got the
[1:13:38.240 --> 1:13:43.760]  judges all come together and say well it was okay for this to be concurrent and that's why
[1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:47.600]  you know they they pulled this thing saying he'd get out on uh march 29th but the fact that
[1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:52.560]  i i never really understood the whole difference in consecutive or concurrent and how a judge can
[1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:59.280]  just make that choice this is frightening well it certainly is i mean i just want to be clear
[1:13:59.280 --> 1:14:05.360]  about this and and of course he agreed in the tape interview you know uh gary webb who pulled
[1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:11.920]  a surprise winner for a dark um empire dealing with the cia drug dealing i mean clearly shot in the
[1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:17.360]  head twice at a previous residency year before he'd seen guys climbing down the back water you
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:22.320]  know pole on the back of his house running off the water pipe he'd been getting threats uh and
[1:14:22.320 --> 1:14:27.040]  then he's murdered uh and his supposed good friend who he'd actually criticized the newspapers
[1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:31.760]  comes out and says oh yes it's quite normal to shoot yourself twice in the head uh i mean i just
[1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:36.640]  hope ricky understand he's not stupid he's a very smart guy yeah understands that he is in great
[1:14:36.640 --> 1:14:41.360]  danger and so i guess you know the fact that he's going to go public uh is already out there so i
[1:14:41.360 --> 1:14:45.600]  guess you need to make the biggest noise possible so that's why you're here so how can we uh try to
[1:14:45.600 --> 1:14:51.840]  get him out uh i mean i go where is he currently being held well this is in the uh all this time
[1:14:51.840 --> 1:14:57.520]  he's been in the texarkana prison when he first you know got put on this case they put him in a uh
[1:14:57.520 --> 1:15:03.200]  victorville um prison where he ended up doing all kinds of talk shows and and and you know
[1:15:03.200 --> 1:15:07.600]  he was on the montel william show and so they picked him up and they put him in the gulag in
[1:15:07.600 --> 1:15:13.280]  texarkana which basically just will not allow any kind of media or anything i've had to conduct
[1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:18.560]  all my interviews just by phone from this prison and uh you know right now we're just kind of
[1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:22.800]  standing by to just see what's going to happen and it's just one of these things where the left
[1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:27.920]  hand doesn't know where the right hand is doing and you know i it's just very frustrating well
[1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:32.880]  you've got to get a you know prison's procedural lawyer because i guarantee you they're not allowed
[1:15:32.880 --> 1:15:38.960]  to just say they lost the paperwork and so you the the warden and people need to know that a
[1:15:38.960 --> 1:15:43.360]  criminal investigation there needs to be a call if you really want to do something a call for a
[1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:48.000]  criminal investigation because they're a criminal statutes on falsely imprisoning somebody when
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:53.920]  they've been ordered released uh with this type of manipulation every day is a felony in a 250
[1:15:53.920 --> 1:15:59.200]  thousand dollar fine under the us code and so uh what are his lawyers saying i mean are they going
[1:15:59.200 --> 1:16:05.280]  after that or yeah i mean his his uh public defender back in in san diego is a really good
[1:16:05.280 --> 1:16:10.000]  guy and you know he's just he's just you know he's working on it but it's just everything
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:15.920]  goes so slow well he needs to get his quote friends to get money together and get a real
[1:16:15.920 --> 1:16:20.160]  attack dog lawyer i'm not bashing this other lawyer but you need not a public defender you
[1:16:20.160 --> 1:16:25.760]  need someone specifically specialized in how to go after because this is not the first time this
[1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:33.040]  has happened when prisons uh hold people improperly right so so that's the whole issue here uh tell me
[1:16:33.040 --> 1:16:39.920]  about straw that's what he goes by uh who is heading up the uh freeway enterprises tell us
[1:16:39.920 --> 1:16:47.280]  about straw before introduce him and then uh well i guess you could say uh he's one of ricky's
[1:16:47.280 --> 1:16:53.280]  disciples i mean he was you know he got arrested for drugs a while back and telling drugs in
[1:16:53.280 --> 1:16:58.080]  chicago he's uh from chicago where i just got back from doing a lecture tour there and filming ricky's
[1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:02.800]  crew there in chicago yeah no doubt selling opium that had been uh shipped in by the cia from
[1:17:02.800 --> 1:17:10.480]  afghanistan yeah and uh so he ended up in prison with rick and rick uh really had an incredible
[1:17:10.480 --> 1:17:15.920]  effect on him and and one thing i have to say is that i've been just meeting just incredible
[1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:21.360]  numbers of people that are all kind of part of like the ricky circle and they're just the most
[1:17:21.360 --> 1:17:28.080]  uh focused intelligent people that i've ever known just incredible the ricky posse well let's
[1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:37.600]  bring up straw uh why but this has been quite a ride for you excuse me yes sir i bet this has been
[1:17:38.400 --> 1:17:47.440]  interesting for you yeah it's been very interesting are you uh worried about your safety uh being

[1:18:06.880 --> 1:18:13.760]  is really not what he's doing what ricky's trying to do is move on with his life and that's basically
[1:18:13.760 --> 1:18:25.280]  what we want we're getting these little operations together not to um not to bring forth whatever
[1:18:25.280 --> 1:18:31.280]  that occurred with him in the past as far as this corruption goes but if you look forward to the future

[1:24:45.440 --> 1:24:49.680]  heading up freeway enterprises for free ricky ross before he gets out of prison
[1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:57.520]  is doing a finish up sir with what you were saying specifically with what ricky ross is going to try
[1:24:57.520 --> 1:25:03.200]  to do once you get shot let's go back to kevin and i want to get monique hall on as well okay what
[1:25:03.200 --> 1:25:09.680]  i was saying was we basically trying to create the opportunity for those folks out there that
[1:25:09.680 --> 1:25:16.000]  really didn't experience what we experienced in the past because of the drug wars to avoid it to
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:21.280]  avoid whatever we had went through in the past to get us in this predicament now now we're trying to
[1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:28.080]  create jobs opportunity but those that come along they're going to school that's not a part of your
[1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:31.760]  your phone's fading out again sir and i think you have a radio on in the background but go ahead
[1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:44.000]  okay okay as i was saying we're trying to give we're trying to give opportunity for those people
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:48.080]  that ain't experienced for those kids that's coming up that didn't experience the stuff we
[1:25:48.080 --> 1:25:53.040]  had went through why the drug wars was going on well that's good i mean the best message out
[1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:57.200]  there is from people who've been involved in the narcotics trade to explain to the young people
[1:25:57.200 --> 1:26:01.680]  it's not cool let me bring up uh money call monique could go good to have you on whether
[1:26:01.680 --> 1:26:06.080]  you're a radio talk show host an author thank you for inviting me on you bet how are you involved in
[1:26:06.080 --> 1:26:11.520]  all this um actually uh ricky is with the front of mine and we're doing the autobiography it's a
[1:26:11.520 --> 1:26:16.640]  group of us uh jimmy de stain who's also incarcerated with him another gentleman by the name of
[1:26:16.640 --> 1:26:23.520]  beach and myself and ricky are doing the back end of the autobiography um and that's how i
[1:26:23.520 --> 1:26:27.840]  actually got involved ricky reached out to me we're friends and he reached out to me i write for
[1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:32.000]  a local magazine here it's it's called three elements and it reaches out to a lot of the
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:36.080]  prisons and through an article from in there ricky and i developed a friendship
[1:26:38.160 --> 1:26:41.040]  what do you think about the fact that he's supposed to be out of prison now and that
[1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:47.120]  their quote lost the paperwork um i think that's like a really big uh issue um that needs to be
[1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:51.360]  addressed for the fact that you know we already know that he did a crime and after doing that
[1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:57.040]  crime he deserves his time to get out to society and do what he needs to do and so um i know there's
[1:26:57.040 --> 1:27:01.920]  a method of doing so i think a lot of the issues that they're saying is that it's a recommended
[1:27:01.920 --> 1:27:07.200]  a recommendation rather than a mandated sentence um as far as the halfway house but if they're
[1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:10.960]  really trying to help him they would actually try to do like they do with any other inmates
[1:27:10.960 --> 1:27:14.080]  and make sure that sure there's a lot of the time to get yourself you know
[1:27:14.080 --> 1:27:18.480]  acclimated back into life sure well how long has he been in prison he's been in prison this
[1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:23.520]  particular format has been 14 years spent a total of 20 that he did five um initially
[1:27:23.520 --> 1:27:29.600]  in the beginning he was out for six months and then he went back in 14 well let's be clear here
[1:27:29.600 --> 1:27:36.320]  the cia and congressional testimony admits they were giving him the drugs they created the conduit
[1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:42.160]  so you gotta love it the uh the mafia dons in the government they then put their own
[1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:47.200]  dealers in jail and run around grandstanding and others folks go and listen to these evil drug
[1:27:47.200 --> 1:27:52.720]  dealers you know throw away the key but they're they're engaged in double think i mean kevin
[1:27:52.720 --> 1:27:58.000]  this is ridiculous he should have never spent any present time the government is bringing this crap in
[1:27:59.200 --> 1:28:03.600]  yeah no i mean while you know his partner blendone who was like his father
[1:28:03.600 --> 1:28:08.480]  you know stepfather to him or whatever back in the in the 90s supposedly he's off in the south of
[1:28:08.480 --> 1:28:14.960]  france live in large and then do it or whatever he wants to do and uh you know ricky like you
[1:28:14.960 --> 1:28:20.400]  know like i explained in my film ricky became the the one fall guy or where you need to calm
[1:28:20.400 --> 1:28:24.320]  the scapegoat for this entire thing well that's what they always do you know i was watching
[1:28:24.320 --> 1:28:29.440]  siriana this morning again a true story and they're there with the oil tycoons about to overthrow
[1:28:29.440 --> 1:28:33.040]  a country and they go look you know there's an investigation we got to burn somebody
[1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:38.960]  give me somebody to burn this is how they work yeah no absolutely and like in my film too you
[1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:45.520]  know uh it was said that uh by robert steel who's on your show all the time the cia operative who
[1:28:45.520 --> 1:28:50.640]  basically is just saying that you know perhaps ricky didn't make enough bribes on the local
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:55.600]  level through through various lawyers that could channel the bribes into various politicians you
[1:28:55.600 --> 1:29:01.440]  know the uh he maybe he didn't take out enough insurance who knows well no that came out that
[1:29:01.440 --> 1:29:04.960]  with iran contra that they were dealing drugs so they had to burn their dealer i mean they had to
[1:29:04.960 --> 1:29:09.760]  burn their one one of their major distributors i mean this is congressional testimony i mean
[1:29:10.320 --> 1:29:17.040]  it's just incredible yeah well let's fire out the websites uh the freeway enterprises uh site
[1:29:17.040 --> 1:29:23.040]  um monique uh you know magazine you want to go and check out freewayenterprise.com um it's a great
[1:29:23.040 --> 1:29:27.600]  site you can get a lot of a feel of ricky he's really not trying to focus so much on the past
[1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:31.920]  but build a new future on the site there's different ways and different opportunities

[1:33:41.040 --> 1:33:45.120]  run by the banks i mean the level of tyranny we will live under is exactly what we put up with
[1:33:45.120 --> 1:33:52.480]  with and it's congressional testimony the c i admits they brought the drugs to ricky ross
[1:33:52.480 --> 1:33:59.520]  they set up the whole deal now is that moral no is what he did good no the issue is it's
[1:33:59.520 --> 1:34:04.560]  hypocritical and a fraud and back when cocaine heroin everything else was sold in drug stores
[1:34:04.560 --> 1:34:09.040]  all over the country until the 30s we had about a third of the people per capita on drugs then
[1:34:09.040 --> 1:34:13.840]  that we have today making them illegal puts massive money into it it corrupts society it corrupts the
[1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:21.520]  police just like alcohol prohibition and kevin boost fine film the american drug war that's aired
[1:34:21.520 --> 1:34:26.080]  on showtime but this is the dvds three hours of extras really a whole separate film so it's five
[1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:31.120]  hours on there that's available right now at info wars dot com hope people will get american drug
[1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:36.720]  war we also paired it up with a berry coopers don't get busted part one and two another police
[1:34:36.720 --> 1:34:42.000]  officer exposing all the corruption in those films you know i want to go back and briefly talk to
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:48.720]  each of you but but kevin in summation the main reason you're on the day is to try to put attention
[1:34:48.720 --> 1:34:53.120]  to the fact that he needs to be let out of prison is supposed to be released and i think it's
[1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:57.440]  important in and that we also explained for him to get out that he's just trying to create an
[1:34:57.440 --> 1:35:03.200]  anti-drug movement and employ people through a media system to do this so i think you know that
[1:35:03.200 --> 1:35:08.000]  that makes it a lot safer for him to be released from prison and that the establishment won't
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:12.480]  be going after him i just know that he in the past has exposed government drug dealing the
[1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:17.840]  hypocrisy and exposed gary webs a clear murder and a lot of other issues so we do appreciate
[1:35:17.840 --> 1:35:25.040]  um ricky ross's courage kevin booth no absolutely and i think uh and i and i look forward to the
[1:35:25.040 --> 1:35:29.520]  day when when he can sit in your studio in person and hopefully that won't be too long from now
[1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:36.560]  uh and and i think you'll you'll learn just that he wasn't just some average dumb guy that got
[1:35:36.560 --> 1:35:43.280]  used to the scapegoat he was a he he was and he still is even more so today a brilliant very
[1:35:43.280 --> 1:35:49.680]  brilliant uh person with incredible magnetism and i think he's going to be a you know he is
[1:35:49.680 --> 1:35:55.120]  going to be like a big positive you know a person for social change and and i think he's going to
[1:35:55.120 --> 1:36:00.640]  be able to help a lot of people and uh you know if he's he's going to be kind of like a black
[1:36:00.640 --> 1:36:06.320]  donald trump if you will but that's going to give back to society and and show that he can do all
[1:36:06.320 --> 1:36:10.640]  these things even under the tyranny that we're living under and kevin if you got the idea that
[1:36:10.640 --> 1:36:16.000]  i was saying you i don't know i mean i didn't say he wasn't smart or i guess you mean for others
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:21.680]  that i didn't mean that yeah sure no i know that's why the cia worked with him was because he did
[1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:28.560]  run it like a professional like an executive as a business yeah no he just he just has like this
[1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:34.160]  magical way of networking like nobody i've ever seen before he uh he's just uh he's incredible
[1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:39.120]  incredible character and uh hopefully you'll get to know him pretty soon you know and and
[1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:43.920]  hopefully this this stuff will you know will blow over and he'll be out pretty soon i i think i've
[1:36:43.920 --> 1:36:47.680]  i've got well specifically from talking to him and then we're going to go back to our other two
[1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:52.800]  guests uh who are working with him i mean what is he planning to do with these freeway enterprises
[1:36:53.680 --> 1:36:58.320]  well you know first of all it's a it's a record label they've already got many artists on there
[1:36:58.320 --> 1:37:05.600]  we i saw some of them guy by the name of stability uh chicago some great hip hop artists so freeway
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:11.760]  enterprises is going to be a record label that's going to be a multimedia conglomerate uh they're
[1:37:11.760 --> 1:37:18.400]  going to handle everything from street artists to producers to filmmakers to just everybody and
[1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:23.840]  just kind of like a big networking thing that ricky is going to be at the center of and like i said
[1:37:23.840 --> 1:37:28.640]  one of the um the things on the reality show is that ricky is going to show that he can earn a million
[1:37:28.640 --> 1:37:33.520]  dollars in one year and then just give that million dollars back to the community and that's just
[1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:38.640]  going to be kind of like a side note of all the other things that he's doing but uh any any plans
[1:37:38.640 --> 1:37:43.920]  on kind of starting at the bottom ricky when he gets out he actually just approved that he can do it
[1:37:43.920 --> 1:37:48.400]  he wants to like you know work at mcdonald's or at home depot or just take on some little
[1:37:48.400 --> 1:37:52.640]  tasks like that in other words he doesn't want any special favors because of who he is and he
[1:37:52.640 --> 1:37:59.200]  wants to show that you know this guy can get out of prison can rebuild himself even under like the
[1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:03.920]  horrible conditions that we're all living under right now with the economy and that you know he
[1:38:03.920 --> 1:38:12.400]  just is hoping to be a you know a beacon of light for a lot of like hopeless people continue well
[1:38:12.400 --> 1:38:18.240]  you know uh i just think the reality show is going to be it's going to be incredible i mean he's
[1:38:18.240 --> 1:38:24.640]  got he's got a big family friends he's got networks in a lot of cities right now i kind of look at
[1:38:24.640 --> 1:38:30.000]  like what we're doing is kind of like a casting kind of pilot creating situation and we're going
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:33.840]  around and we're just filming we filmed this hearing we went to chicago i filmed for several
[1:38:33.840 --> 1:38:40.960]  days in chicago and uh just all these these incredible characters and so um it's going to be a
[1:38:40.960 --> 1:38:46.720]  really interesting reality show we're not exactly where it's going to land as of now it might be
[1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:52.480]  bpt it might be mtv we're not sure where it's going to land we're currently you know in uh
[1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:59.040]  meetings with that and uh um that's about it man you know the the first thing we're going to do
[1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:02.960]  it's going to be like the cannonball run when he gets when he does get out of prison he's going
[1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:07.840]  to have only so many hours to get to the halfway house and then we're going to be like a like
[1:39:07.840 --> 1:39:13.040]  24 hours to drive across the united states it's going to be like a like a funny dom delawis
[1:39:13.040 --> 1:39:21.200]  movie or something oh oh so we can play eastbound and down then yeah oh smoke he's got his ears on
[1:39:21.200 --> 1:39:27.040]  he's on your tail and he ain't going to rest till you're in jail so you got to dodge him you got to
[1:39:27.040 --> 1:39:32.880]  duck him you got to keep that diesel trucking all right well that's interesting let's um can't
[1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:39.680]  wait to um see another guy i don't know if he's standing by i named hakeem also goes by the
[1:39:39.680 --> 1:39:48.080]  name royce um he was part of special operations and i know he might be standing there next to straw
[1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:53.760]  but he was actually in Panama during the whole noriega incident he actually uh knows some cool
[1:39:53.760 --> 1:39:58.400]  things about all this i don't know if he wants to get on the phone sure let's bring uh hakeem up
[1:39:58.400 --> 1:40:04.240]  sir how were you quoting special operations uh specifically uh yes sir i was on intelligence
[1:40:04.240 --> 1:40:11.280]  analysts for the uh military and attached to the department of defense in Panama from 1985 to 1989
[1:40:13.840 --> 1:40:20.720]  tell us about that well um when i first got them a spanish language so i was attached to a
[1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:26.320]  special forces shielding down there and during the uh first three years of my assignment there
[1:40:26.320 --> 1:40:33.280]  the u.s. was involved with the uh contra operation and hunderess and uh we were assisting the
[1:40:33.280 --> 1:40:38.640]  contras to overthrow the sidenista government and then my capacity as an analyst there i
[1:40:38.640 --> 1:40:45.120]  witnessed a lot of activities and things that ended up being well five or six years later i
[1:40:45.120 --> 1:40:50.800]  realized the scope and the extent of it but a lot of us were only aware of the iran country affairs
[1:40:50.800 --> 1:40:56.960]  as far as the u.s. buying weapons or selling weapons to iran and using the money to support the
[1:40:56.960 --> 1:41:02.000]  contras after congress cut out on funding when they found out the operations we were running
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:07.280]  well now we're now we're talking now we're talking because because let me specifically
[1:41:07.280 --> 1:41:11.840]  tell us a little bit about about yourself how you know free ricky ross but this is important
[1:41:11.840 --> 1:41:17.200]  because we've had sella castello who's been on nightline and you name it the head de agent down
[1:41:17.200 --> 1:41:24.240]  there at the time with the uh with the dea and he witnessed them shipping cocaine out for um
[1:41:24.240 --> 1:41:29.280]  california for the united states out of elopongo but of course you were compartmentalized at the
[1:41:29.280 --> 1:41:35.760]  time what did you see i actually uh assisted and went on drug and addiction race throughout central
[1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:42.960]  and south america and i witnessed from my capacity to stop piling of cocaine at the time i had no
[1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:47.840]  idea but the need to know basis i didn't know where the ultimate destination was but i was aware
[1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:53.360]  that we were raiding processing plants in south america bringing the cocaine into panama after
[1:41:53.360 --> 1:41:59.200]  destroying as much as we could at the processing plants but we bring a certain amount into panama
[1:41:59.200 --> 1:42:04.240]  self and at that point just through a little joint message traffic i started noticing that
[1:42:04.240 --> 1:42:09.760]  things were coming into arkansas and north carolina california and different places but
[1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:17.920]  i didn't know why where or to who and um being involved with it at the level that i got involved
[1:42:17.920 --> 1:42:24.160]  with it i started along with others to start sending stuff ourselves to the united states
[1:42:24.160 --> 1:42:30.640]  hence i ended up in federal prison for 13 and a half years because of my involvement and prior
[1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:35.440]  to that you know we we signed non-disclosure agreements agreeing not to discuss some of the
[1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:39.360]  things that we did and some of them hadn't declassified until after this i ran conscious
[1:42:39.360 --> 1:42:45.680]  scandal had surfaced but once that came to light then you know the light bulb came on like okay
[1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:50.320]  so this is what we were doing and it kind of it put a bad case in my mouth about our government
[1:42:50.320 --> 1:42:55.440]  and the administration and they're not just that administration is who knows how long these type of
[1:42:55.440 --> 1:43:00.080]  activities have been going on you know that may have been the premise for the whole vietnam war
[1:43:00.080 --> 1:43:05.360]  so no one knew well it's a minute they were bringing in the the the heroin uh inside the
[1:43:06.080 --> 1:43:14.160]  triangle sure but after a while you know it it gets to a point where they have to clean house
[1:43:14.160 --> 1:43:19.600]  so when they did the indictment of noriega we you know that was much publicized worldwide but
[1:43:19.600 --> 1:43:25.040]  it wasn't publicized that there were almost 60 americans you know with different levels of rank
[1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:30.080]  in the military the army the air force the navy who were involved with drug trafficking at the time
[1:43:30.080 --> 1:43:34.800]  and the first thing that our government always does is discredit you because they control the media
[1:43:34.800 --> 1:43:39.440]  they can they can tell us basically what to think you know they they put the american people thought
[1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:44.400]  when you know we're criminals we're the worst with the scores of society but all along it's our
[1:43:44.400 --> 1:43:49.200]  government that sponsors all of these activities and we were just tools and then after a while you
[1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:53.760]  know they give you 20 years sentence said you are smuggler you were privy to classified information
[1:43:53.760 --> 1:43:58.480]  you you use that information to smuggle drugs into the country and they made all of us they
[1:43:58.480 --> 1:44:03.760]  vilified all of us as if we were the wrongdoers but we were doing what we were ordered to do
[1:44:03.760 --> 1:44:09.920]  well let me stop here right there uh back in 1998 i confronted general barry mccaffrey then
[1:44:09.920 --> 1:44:14.480]  head drug czar kevin put it in his american drug war film and i read to him the reuters article
[1:44:14.480 --> 1:44:20.320]  out that week where the head of the armies complete drug interdiction for latin america
[1:44:20.320 --> 1:44:26.720]  was caught with his wife shipping in heroin and cocaine to new york and and and from research
[1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:31.840]  that's pretty much standard isn't it's kind of the wink wink the government has its big shipments
[1:44:31.840 --> 1:44:36.880]  but you get to have your own little shipments as a payoff but then they burn people to make it look
[1:44:36.880 --> 1:44:42.640]  like with the drug smuggling is being done by rogue agents exactly but then you look at you
[1:44:42.640 --> 1:44:49.520]  know this thing got so big so fast and exposed so quickly that when they cleaned house they started
[1:44:49.520 --> 1:44:55.760]  with kasey the director of cia you know just coincidentally he has an aneurysm right before
[1:44:55.760 --> 1:45:01.440]  he goes to testify to the senate subcommittee after everyone pointed the finger at him and gary
[1:45:01.440 --> 1:45:10.800]  wamp exposed uh rick ross's uh connection to the uh cia uh iran concert program and he's dead
[1:45:10.800 --> 1:45:15.840]  and you know it's just it's dangerous yeah that's the point i was trying to make to kevin everybody
[1:45:15.840 --> 1:45:23.840]  else this is dangerous uh hakeem we may do a story on this what's your full name um at this moment
[1:45:23.840 --> 1:45:28.400]  that's okay if you don't want to tell it that's fine but i mean just in my experience once you
[1:45:28.400 --> 1:45:34.160]  put the cat halfway out of the bag you might as well all the way yeah it's dangerous to be halfway
[1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:39.040]  out of the bag i mean i assure you they know who you are how did you get to know ricky ross um
[1:45:39.040 --> 1:45:45.120]  actually when i first got back to the united states in 1989 uh prior to my uh being deported
[1:45:45.120 --> 1:45:50.240]  from panama i i spoke with some individuals who knew a couple of the individuals who were actually
[1:45:50.240 --> 1:45:57.600]  receiving the uh drugs that were staged in panama and his name surfaced in so when i got back here
[1:45:57.600 --> 1:46:02.800]  i was aware of who he is but i didn't know i actually went to federal prison the same year he
[1:46:02.800 --> 1:46:10.880]  did 1994 and um so i had an idea who he was but it hadn't surfaced gary webb's story hadn't surfaced
[1:46:10.880 --> 1:46:16.080]  yet so i pretty much kept that stuff under my belt my vest until well look at how they killed
[1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:20.960]  i went okay it's out there now so i might as well say what little i can about it well look at
[1:46:20.960 --> 1:46:27.920]  how they killed uh barry seal and he had george bush senior's number in his top pocket when i was
[1:46:27.920 --> 1:46:33.120]  talking to straw about him just the other day i said he was he did the exact same thing and you
[1:46:33.120 --> 1:46:37.920]  know but he actually tried to protect himself by recording some of the things and that was probably
[1:46:37.920 --> 1:46:42.800]  the biggest mistake he made because it's just you know after a while you look at it and it kind of
[1:46:42.800 --> 1:46:47.520]  gives you a bad taste in your mouth so what we're trying to do now we're focusing on okay we did
[1:46:47.520 --> 1:46:52.480]  what we did it's out there people know they're gonna believe it or not believe it so what we
[1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:58.640]  can do now is try to prevent any other young afghan americans or minor minorities or anyone
[1:46:58.640 --> 1:47:03.200]  who is considering getting involved with the drug trade or any illegal illicit activity
[1:47:03.200 --> 1:47:06.960]  so give them an opportunity to do something different you know and well that's what i always
[1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:11.760]  already suffered time well that's what i don't have an opportunity to do something positive so
[1:47:11.760 --> 1:47:18.720]  sure sure that's what i'm out and um god willing they'll let rick get out but you know it's it's
[1:47:18.720 --> 1:47:23.840]  kind of strange you know i've been in federal prison i looked at the situation there's no reason
[1:47:23.840 --> 1:47:29.200]  that the judge should not have released him at the time that he should be released now he can
[1:47:29.200 --> 1:47:34.400]  always say well the halfway house didn't have a bed available or whatever but anything other than
[1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:39.920]  that is personally it has nothing to do with professional hakeem hakeem yes sir you know
[1:47:39.920 --> 1:47:45.680]  in in closing i'd like to have you back up for a longer interview one second yet what you're
[1:47:45.680 --> 1:47:50.000]  talking about who you are i mean i believe you uh it was kevin's working with you and shows mr ross
[1:47:51.360 --> 1:47:54.640]  but this is the point i was bringing up to kevin earlier i know kevin knows this
[1:47:54.640 --> 1:47:59.360]  this is the type of stuff that gets you killed so i do think it's important that you're on record
[1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:04.800]  saying that you're just going to try to expose uh the destructive drug culture uh and and that
[1:48:04.800 --> 1:48:09.600]  you're not you know for your own safety uh not going to be you know going down that road of going
[1:48:09.600 --> 1:48:15.040]  back over the past now you know i do that separately i risk my life that's what i do every day that's
[1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:21.040]  what i'm here for uh but specifically now we fleshed all of that out uh it's just the issue here is
[1:48:22.480 --> 1:48:28.000]  that uh we need to get mr ross out of prison because he is in danger while he's in there and
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:32.960]  the fact that they're holding him like this and holding it up is very very suspicious uh and so
[1:48:32.960 --> 1:48:40.800]  we just appreciate your courage uh on coming on the show as well but the drug culture is a trap
[1:48:40.800 --> 1:48:45.600]  they they want to get people into their prison system if you go look at the graph from 1980 to
[1:48:45.600 --> 1:48:51.520]  now how the prison population went up sevenfold to the biggest in the world you understand this
[1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:56.880]  is a trap they bring in drugs they make it illegal they make it hugely profitable because it's illegal
[1:48:56.880 --> 1:49:03.520]  they know the young people start using it it is a way to re-institute slavery in the united states
[1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:09.120]  and so i commend what you're doing and and the young people will listen to people that come
[1:49:09.120 --> 1:49:13.440]  from the rock and roll drug culture as the media advertises i think this is going to be very very
[1:49:13.440 --> 1:49:18.400]  successful and i appreciate you coming on so thank you uh hakeem i wanted to get some closing
[1:49:18.400 --> 1:49:22.240]  comments because we're about to break and i've got to come back with other news uh from uh

[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:53.840]  but that is coming up i want to go ahead and start getting into the latest developments
[2:00:53.840 --> 2:01:01.920]  with the military tracking and tracing us and i'm going to do that as briefly but it is succinct
[2:01:01.920 --> 2:01:11.360]  to fashion as i possibly can when we start the next segment and we'll get alan watt's take on
[2:01:11.360 --> 2:01:25.840]  that we're gonna go live at prisonplanet.tv so we'll go live at prisonplanet.tv when we
[2:01:25.840 --> 2:01:34.640]  start the next segment about six minutes united states army reserve force protection advisory 09
[2:01:38.880 --> 2:01:45.840]  and this is from november 17 2008 four days before national protest against
[2:01:45.840 --> 2:01:56.400]  the federal reserve so i thought we'd go over this document when we get back and start the
[2:01:56.400 --> 2:02:02.320]  next segment and that dovetails with articles like the one i'm looking at on prisonplanet.com
[2:02:02.320 --> 2:02:07.440]  the uk government trains thousands of civilian terror spies and already all over england it's
[2:02:07.440 --> 2:02:11.920]  happened to me it's happened to uh steve watson in london they'll just walk up to you when you're

[2:03:00.160 --> 2:03:06.880]  is an unprecedented effort by a president to reach congress and tap grassroots supporters for
[2:03:06.880 --> 2:03:12.400]  their help and if these people go to like 27 doors that would be everybody in the country
[2:03:12.400 --> 2:03:17.360]  basically every person in the country would be visited by him think of the power that gives him
[2:03:18.080 --> 2:03:22.560]  volunteers recruited online by obama's organization for america post-election group
[2:03:22.560 --> 2:03:27.440]  the last citizens to sign a pledge in support of the president's policies on energy healthcare

[2:03:32.240 --> 2:03:36.560]  bankers on the dotted line from the chronicle article this is just the beginning for us said
[2:03:36.560 --> 2:03:41.360]  jeremy bird deputy national director of organizing for america and online video to obama supporters
[2:03:41.360 --> 2:03:47.920]  last week the establishment in washington won't welcome this new direction easily we can't let
[2:03:47.920 --> 2:03:53.680]  this plan be debated solely behind closed doors in washington dc the canvass is on saturday
[2:03:54.320 --> 2:03:58.400]  the pledge drive and the calls to congress are all designed to put our elected officials on
[2:03:58.400 --> 2:04:04.240]  washington will notice that the american people expect the change president obama campaign for
[2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:10.080]  becomes reality and organizing america press release explains i mean think of this they're
[2:04:10.080 --> 2:04:15.040]  saying obama is anti-establishment and fighting special interest remember a few weeks ago when he
[2:04:15.040 --> 2:04:19.600]  said i know special interest are going to be against what i'm doing and they're going to fight will be
[2:04:19.600 --> 2:04:27.200]  put on notice i'm going to be fighting i'm going to fight as well as if he's fighting the establishment
[2:04:27.200 --> 2:04:33.040]  and now he's got all these goons who he told you well-meaning people but their goons on the last
[2:04:33.840 --> 2:04:39.120]  who believe that oh we'd have free jobs and free health care and new houses and all their
[2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:44.080]  problems will be solved this is what they say if we just do whatever obama says so see when you
[2:04:44.080 --> 2:04:48.400]  don't do what he says that's why the economy is getting bad not because the bankers that own him

[2:09:22.880 --> 2:09:28.880]  army in the departments they sent this report demonizing ron paul supporters bob bar supporters

[2:09:41.360 --> 2:09:45.280]  police was there even though we call the state police we had state reps on about it the governor
[2:09:45.280 --> 2:09:49.600]  now has told the associated press governor nixon of missouri that he stands behind it is their

[2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:57.920]  in san francisco and austin texas that we've shown here on air they're public that have gotten
[2:09:57.920 --> 2:10:02.480]  mainstream news say a rhodal almanac in your car sign of being a terrorist cell phone you're a
[2:10:02.480 --> 2:10:08.160]  terrorist blue jeans you're a terrorist you cannot make this up so they tell the public this is all
[2:10:08.160 --> 2:10:13.200]  for imaginary al-qaeda lc iada but the whole thing has been built and designed for the american
[2:10:13.200 --> 2:10:17.680]  people and now north com is announcing 20 000 regular troops to engage the american people
[2:10:17.680 --> 2:10:21.840]  the army war colleges they're getting rid of posse commentatus that they will use the military

[2:13:00.800 --> 2:13:08.160]  obama deception and it's been admitted that arming intelligence uh tracks and traces
[2:13:10.640 --> 2:13:16.560]  mainline peace groups mainline anti-death penalty groups mainline you know gondy nonviolent groups

[2:13:27.040 --> 2:13:34.320]  churches to hear what's being said the state police uh the feds all of them so all of that
[2:13:34.320 --> 2:13:38.960]  is going on that's been in the news and it's a felony when they do it i mean it's a violation of
[2:13:38.960 --> 2:13:43.200]  federal law the army's not supposed to do this the only time they can watch people is if that
[2:13:43.200 --> 2:13:47.920]  they're at a military reservation but they can't be outside of the reservation watching people
[2:13:47.920 --> 2:13:54.160]  they were in this case um the liberty restoration project and we made calls and confirmed down to
[2:13:54.160 --> 2:13:58.640]  camp mavery where it's run out of and fordhood this is actually run out of austin this is a report
[2:13:58.640 --> 2:14:05.200]  put out in texas but it it says that there's nationwide nexus points this is being done
[2:14:05.200 --> 2:14:10.080]  everywhere through the threat fusion centers same ones that put out the myac report federally written
[2:14:11.280 --> 2:14:17.680]  that basically people protesting the fed the liberty committee ron paul could be
[2:14:17.680 --> 2:14:22.240]  terrorist and maybe planning violent attacks and it tells the police how to be careful how
[2:14:22.240 --> 2:14:26.800]  the fbi to be careful with the armies there to support them dealing with us that we may
[2:14:26.800 --> 2:14:32.160]  basically decide to attack it tells their officers be very careful these people are deadly dangerous
[2:14:32.160 --> 2:14:39.520]  basically uh and you can read that report it is up on info wars dot com and prison planet
[2:14:39.520 --> 2:14:44.960]  dot com here is the report you can see the order sheet for covering the houston and dalis

[2:15:00.560 --> 2:15:09.360]  with the local police now this one is different than the myac report because it doesn't start
[2:15:09.360 --> 2:15:15.360]  out listing cop killers and saying these people want to kill you it starts out sounding reasonable
[2:15:15.360 --> 2:15:22.480]  saying what we stand for and what we believe in again this is secret police this is the military

[2:24:18.160 --> 2:24:23.200]  later in the sour with the army report we're calling him again right now trying to get a
[2:24:23.200 --> 2:24:28.000]  interview with them and why are they spying on americans why are they following protesters
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:32.240]  but the fact is this was leaked to us so just like the state police leaked us the other documents
[2:24:32.240 --> 2:24:38.240]  they don't like what's happening they're upset about what's going on in this country but but
[2:24:38.240 --> 2:24:44.720]  meanwhile they are creating a 13 million and they plan to double that the next few months
[2:24:45.680 --> 2:24:49.840]  to go knock on your doors the san francisco chronicle reports as we told you six months ago
[2:24:49.840 --> 2:24:57.120]  and it's in the obama deception literal classic fascism to push pro-fetal reserve doctrine
[2:24:57.120 --> 2:25:00.960]  and ideas but then meanwhile if you're against the federal reserve when exercise your first
[2:25:00.960 --> 2:25:05.120]  amendment you're a dangerous terrorist and they're telling the army who's spying on us
[2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:08.640]  look out because these are dangerous terrorists they may try to kill you i mean you know how to
[2:25:08.640 --> 2:25:13.440]  protect themselves how to sneak to the location how to have weapons how to look out i mean this
[2:25:13.440 --> 2:25:17.920]  is slander this is demonization alan what i tell you things are really intensifying
[2:25:17.920 --> 2:25:23.440]  yes they are across the whole world in fact every country's got its own little program
[2:25:24.480 --> 2:25:32.080]  on par with this in fact and it's the creation of total total tyranny basically and the message
[2:25:32.080 --> 2:25:36.880]  is to get it out to the public by the elite themselves that they are going to stand no
[2:25:36.880 --> 2:25:42.240]  nonsense that they're trying to cow the public into silence and submission by terrorizing them
[2:25:42.240 --> 2:25:47.680]  basically and people are generally afraid of being put on a list of some kind or another
[2:25:47.680 --> 2:25:52.080]  i tell them not to worry because you're already you're already on some kind of list if you think
[2:25:52.080 --> 2:25:58.160]  at all everywhere you know it or not and you have to speak now because we're going into the worst
[2:25:58.720 --> 2:26:05.120]  tyranny this planet has ever seen this is global yeah you're absolutely right this is done as a
[2:26:05.120 --> 2:26:11.040]  chilling effect and they want the public to know that army intelligence is watching major
[2:26:11.040 --> 2:26:14.960]  churches and everybody else they want the people to know they're committing these federal crimes
[2:26:14.960 --> 2:26:20.080]  it is a federal crime to do this they suddenly are putting troops checkpoints and shootings and
[2:26:20.080 --> 2:26:24.400]  just to get everybody prepared for that as they implode the world economy and the answer is all
[2:26:24.400 --> 2:26:28.880]  of us getting on a list they can't get all of us and we have to stand up and say no what you're
[2:26:28.880 --> 2:26:35.440]  doing is criminal what you're doing is wrong but for those that don't know world history is this
[2:26:35.440 --> 2:26:39.600]  not classic tyranny to have secret police with the military spying on the american people
[2:26:39.600 --> 2:26:46.640]  it's class absolutely classic and now we have britain admitting not only are the training
[2:26:46.640 --> 2:26:52.080]  60 000 people to spy on the general public from within the general public all the way
[2:26:52.080 --> 2:26:57.280]  down to chamber maids and hotels but they've already trained thousands of people already
[2:26:57.280 --> 2:27:02.960]  quietly well where did this go through any parliamentary bill it was never discussed
[2:27:02.960 --> 2:27:07.360]  anywhere so really they're beyond the law they're beyond democracy they're beyond
[2:27:07.360 --> 2:27:13.360]  parliaments in congress uh this there's a much higher force at work here uh dictating what's
[2:27:13.360 --> 2:27:19.200]  happening and to be honest with you we lost all of that during the cold war when the intelligence
[2:27:19.200 --> 2:27:24.640]  agencies took over and even politicians were not allowed to know what they were up to these um
[2:27:25.440 --> 2:27:33.120]  high agencies respond to a much higher government uh an elected government comprising of the bankers
[2:27:33.120 --> 2:27:39.760]  of the ultra rich rich and elites and again all the foundations that front for them with their NGOs
[2:27:39.760 --> 2:27:46.240]  so they're bypassing all the usual channels in fact as i say uh when you go into the writings of
[2:27:46.240 --> 2:27:51.200]  the big think tanks that work for this global system on behalf of the elite like the club of
[2:27:51.200 --> 2:27:57.440]  rome they said that democracy was just too cumbersome they wanted collectivism under collectivism
[2:27:57.440 --> 2:28:04.080]  you're looking at a china basically where you have a communistic government it's got a strange
[2:28:04.080 --> 2:28:12.240]  semi or quasi capitalist tinge to it and to be a multimillionaire in the china you have to join
[2:28:12.240 --> 2:28:18.960]  the local communist party so all those in the communist party at the top are uh vetted already
[2:28:18.960 --> 2:28:23.760]  they're allowed to come up in business the government helps to finance them up and it's a criminal
[2:28:23.760 --> 2:28:30.320]  group of parasites sitting above society calling it capitalist and free market while they suck the
[2:28:30.320 --> 2:28:34.800]  population dry you know for those that said we were making it up from his own book and his
[2:28:34.800 --> 2:28:39.200]  own documents that they were going to set up youth brigades a million person domestic spy force
[2:28:39.200 --> 2:28:44.960]  but also serve overseas the house passed at the beginning of a national draft they say compulsory
[2:28:44.960 --> 2:28:50.640]  national service 18 to 24 and they have another core for adults uh that is now past the house it
[2:28:50.640 --> 2:28:56.720]  is now officially going to the senate and still the public is in complete denial absolute denial
[2:28:56.720 --> 2:29:01.200]  they cannot believe it again you have a generation that's grown up they've forgotten everything
[2:29:01.200 --> 2:29:04.800]  they've been taught very little at school they've never lived through the hard times
[2:29:05.440 --> 2:29:10.960]  and uh and hit them all at once the the depressions hit them all at once they've been told to
[2:29:11.920 --> 2:29:17.360]  enjoy themselves they've been trained to enjoy themselves and just spend and accumulate etc
[2:29:17.360 --> 2:29:22.880]  and i've taken that system from them and if not they've no history to fall back on a personal
[2:29:22.880 --> 2:29:28.960]  experience of what tyranny can be or martial law so to them it's all brand new and they're
[2:29:28.960 --> 2:29:33.440]  utter and complete denial and now that they're taking the old system away they're giving them
[2:29:33.440 --> 2:29:39.760]  the new one force compulsory service tattle tail brigades 13 person 13 million person

[2:33:22.960 --> 2:33:31.280]  that was mailed by ron paul bob bar and of course chuck bald one to the governor whose seal was on
[2:33:31.280 --> 2:33:35.280]  the top of the federally written document saying people the ron paul stickers are basically terrorist
[2:33:35.280 --> 2:33:38.560]  and there's no such things in the north american union and then if you talk about it you basically
[2:33:38.560 --> 2:33:46.160]  are a cop killer and so that's up on info wars dot com right now this brainwashing of the police
[2:33:46.160 --> 2:33:51.680]  and the military ron paul did get more political contributions than any other candidate combined
[2:33:51.680 --> 2:33:57.600]  the police military i talked to are waking up the elite are not invincible alan and i do see a lot
[2:33:57.600 --> 2:34:02.000]  of their people waking up thanks to your work and my work and many other people's work i mean
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:05.760]  they're certainly moving on us on every front but the but there is a big awakening happening
[2:34:05.760 --> 2:34:11.920]  i mean i think we've got some hope here there's an awakening as a dicey time for those in control
[2:34:11.920 --> 2:34:17.280]  this is a plan remember that we're living through it was this stage of it at no doubt was planned
[2:34:17.280 --> 2:34:23.200]  probably 50 years ago or more and uh... it's a very delicate position for them to go through
[2:34:23.200 --> 2:34:28.400]  that's why they're using the heavy hand and and fear tactics to terrify the public to just go along
[2:34:28.400 --> 2:34:32.800]  with it but that's a risk for them but you and others always said that when they finally emerged
[2:34:32.800 --> 2:34:37.120]  and went for the world bank of the world you know global government that by revealing themselves
[2:34:37.120 --> 2:34:41.360]  that was the weak point because they've always been denying it previously that's right and they're
[2:34:41.360 --> 2:34:46.560]  well aware they are well aware that they could lose this that's why they're going to use every
[2:34:46.560 --> 2:34:53.200]  tactic possible to keep it on course uh... but uh... yes very delicate position for them if the
[2:34:53.200 --> 2:34:59.120]  people care enough the people generally care enough when there's nothing left unfortunately and by
[2:34:59.120 --> 2:35:03.760]  that time it's too late you have to be able to think rationally when you're well-fed and all
[2:35:03.760 --> 2:35:10.000]  the rest of it to do what you have to do and there's no point sitting quietly answering
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:13.680]  questions to someone coming to your door to make sure you're a good little citizen who's
[2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:19.120]  going to comply with all the new rules that's right start being vocal now i agree with you before
[2:35:19.120 --> 2:35:24.160]  they have us in the full depression and poses our saviors so that we will accept that in the fema
[2:35:24.160 --> 2:35:30.000]  camps for our safety people begging you know uh... in in waiting lines to get into the camps
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:33.600]  always when that when they did urban warfare drills that i would videotape over a decade ago
[2:35:33.600 --> 2:35:38.160]  they would have the role player screaming i'm an american let me in the camp and then there'd be a
[2:35:38.160 --> 2:35:42.640]  few who didn't want to go to the camp but most were begging to get in and now that's how they're
[2:35:42.640 --> 2:35:47.440]  selling it today we need to get in the face of these thugs these people knocking on our doors
[2:35:47.440 --> 2:35:52.400]  these neighbors spying on us let everybody know that this is criminal this is anti-freedom this is
[2:35:52.400 --> 2:35:57.680]  classical tyranny this is what happened in china it is still going on in china this is
[2:35:57.680 --> 2:36:03.520]  the criminal elite trying to have a complete and total criminal takeover and now when i totally
[2:36:03.520 --> 2:36:08.400]  agree with you that we've got a screen bloody murder now and point out that it's the private
[2:36:08.400 --> 2:36:12.560]  federal reserve in the new world order globally that are carrying this out that's why they're
[2:36:12.560 --> 2:36:17.040]  they're so scared of us protesting the fed and getting media attention and pointing out there
[2:36:17.040 --> 2:36:21.520]  the bad guys that's why while we were there protesting the fed and Dallas they had over
[2:36:21.520 --> 2:36:25.920]  200 professors and school teachers in there indoctrinating them and paying them to be
[2:36:25.920 --> 2:36:30.080]  part of a course to go out and then brainwash people about how great the federal reserve is
[2:36:30.080 --> 2:36:37.040]  so they've got a massive pr campaign admittedly going right now yes and i think so as anything
[2:36:37.040 --> 2:36:42.240]  was quite right he said that you have to stop this right at the beginning i said once they get going
[2:36:42.240 --> 2:36:46.720]  if what they did in the soviet system and i can see it coming down here they're copying it to that was
[2:36:46.720 --> 2:36:52.720]  a trial for the whole world they turn out the whole street when the kgb went in to arrest a
[2:36:52.720 --> 2:36:58.080]  couple of people and drag them out to make sure that everyone got the message to terrify everybody
[2:36:58.080 --> 2:37:03.040]  in the street and that made everyone draw into the little cell they didn't talk to their neighbors
[2:37:03.040 --> 2:37:08.080]  you went or you just went through life quietly looking at the ground the sidewalk and that's
[2:37:08.080 --> 2:37:13.200]  what they hope to to use here for a whole generation while they go up go through this whole course
[2:37:13.200 --> 2:37:18.560]  into the next step of globalization so we can't let that happen you've got to hit it right now
[2:37:18.560 --> 2:37:25.120]  and and don't be afraid yeah right now is the crossroads either they win or we defeat them
[2:37:25.120 --> 2:37:31.280]  right now the good news is as i was saying earlier the resistance to this tyranny is really mounting
[2:37:31.280 --> 2:37:36.160]  and a lot of people see it but on top of that i get dozens of articles every day just like this
[2:37:36.160 --> 2:37:41.600]  one and i'm so busy i never even cover half of them alan here is the associated press
[2:37:42.720 --> 2:37:50.320]  this is the associated press today and you think you were living in communist russia to hear this
[2:37:50.320 --> 2:37:56.720]  hillary the movie now showing at supreme court and you read the article it says the supreme court
[2:37:56.720 --> 2:38:03.040]  will decide if you're allowed to make a film criticizing government leaders and that it
[2:38:03.040 --> 2:38:10.480]  is under election law now to make a film criticizing any elected official and that they're deciding
[2:38:11.360 --> 2:38:16.160]  not just the fairness doctrine for talk radio but they're deciding to restrict free speech on the
[2:38:16.160 --> 2:38:20.880]  internet everything that's what the violent radicalization act is about that's what these
[2:38:20.880 --> 2:38:28.160]  different i mean the article actually says that that they may basically ban this movie and not
[2:38:28.160 --> 2:38:33.440]  let it be shown or be seen and this fight's been going on since last year during the election so
[2:38:33.440 --> 2:38:39.680]  but but meanwhile obama and the government can run national tv ads advertising people to join
[2:38:39.680 --> 2:38:45.520]  usaservice.org which is a private democratic party group with 13 million san francisco chronicle
[2:38:45.520 --> 2:38:50.880]  reported and he announced it on jay leno knocking on your door saying do you pledge are you with us
[2:38:50.880 --> 2:38:55.760]  i mean this is happening faster than i thought yeah again because it was planned that way long
[2:38:55.760 --> 2:39:01.280]  before obama we even heard his name he was groomed for this to take over from bush they had them all
[2:39:01.280 --> 2:39:07.440]  set up like ducks in a row for the decade and this is all planned i had that's why it's going to
[2:39:07.440 --> 2:39:12.720]  head so quickly smoothly because it was all done all the paper what was done implementation techniques
[2:39:12.720 --> 2:39:19.040]  were worked out before he was even elected into office so this is why it's going this way the
[2:39:19.040 --> 2:39:25.120]  same thing happened in britain yeah if a big organization called common purpose it uses
[2:39:25.120 --> 2:39:30.880]  the techniques of the royal issue for international affairs or the cfr it has military commanders as
[2:39:30.880 --> 2:39:37.200]  members of it high commanders and high police officials mi6 no the rest of it which tells me
[2:39:37.200 --> 2:39:42.640]  that this is a branch that's already been trained this is a new NGO that's been trained by mr brown
[2:39:42.640 --> 2:39:47.200]  as he said they've already trained thousands that falls right into that category so they're using
[2:39:47.200 --> 2:39:54.000]  these strange civilian uh systems that work with the military they're given almost military clearance
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:59.840]  at to work amongst the general public so they've already been at this training them that falling
[2:39:59.840 --> 2:40:06.400]  in with the pre-speech of the internet i was watching a video by g rockefeller and he was
[2:40:06.400 --> 2:40:10.640]  saying is the worst thing they gave the public and that they're actually considering withdrawing it
[2:40:10.640 --> 2:40:16.560]  because of the damages doing to basically their agenda yeah the quote is it would be better
[2:40:17.120 --> 2:40:20.480]  better off that we never had the internet go ahead that's right and then you try that in
[2:40:20.480 --> 2:40:25.680]  with australia where now whatever happens in the world today you can guarantee it's going to work
[2:40:25.680 --> 2:40:30.400]  across the board across the whole world in australia they're going to start to gonna
[2:40:30.400 --> 2:40:36.400]  find people eleven thousand dollars per day for having illegal sites up on the web and these legal
[2:40:36.400 --> 2:40:41.200]  sites are banned by the government you won't even know if you're on the list until it's only
[2:40:41.200 --> 2:40:47.920]  mainstream news hyperlink if you hyperlink to wiki links or any of these sites thousands
[2:40:47.920 --> 2:40:52.640]  and thousands being added a week then and and it's up to you to know if it's a banned site
[2:40:52.640 --> 2:40:57.360]  they're gonna and then the headline is chinese style net censorship coming the government says
[2:40:57.360 --> 2:41:01.920]  that themselves and says you'll only be able to visit a few thousand sites and i was listening
[2:41:01.920 --> 2:41:07.200]  to the british lord the inventor of the internet on vbc this weekend in the car on xm and he admitted
[2:41:07.200 --> 2:41:12.960]  yes we're killing the old web right now and everything you do is being tracked and traced
[2:41:12.960 --> 2:41:17.280]  and uh the new york times a month ago announced we are getting rid of the old web it will be
[2:41:17.280 --> 2:41:23.440]  a safer friendlier gate keep these that term gatekeeping web that we control now just backing
[2:41:23.440 --> 2:41:28.400]  you up going back about two minutes i want you to continue on the line of censorship you know how
[2:41:28.400 --> 2:41:32.320]  they're bringing out just this diametrically a pros to liberty and freedom and the magna
[2:41:32.320 --> 2:41:38.240]  card and bill of rights and just basic freedom this obvious criminality by the state and uh
[2:41:38.240 --> 2:41:42.880]  you mentioned almost military level clearance under infraguard fifty thousand executives
[2:41:42.880 --> 2:41:46.640]  and infrastructure protection they're armed they're trained by the fb i secretly now it's
[2:41:46.640 --> 2:41:51.120]  in the associated press we shoot to kill orders of whoever they're told to kill in their company
[2:41:51.120 --> 2:41:56.400]  when the fb i tells them they have the twenty six thousand clergy response teams preparing
[2:41:56.400 --> 2:41:59.600]  everybody to go to the camps and take force inoculations we told you a year and a before it
[2:41:59.600 --> 2:42:04.800]  was declassified it's now public mainstream news uh and and they've now announced this one million
[2:42:04.800 --> 2:42:09.360]  man and they pentagon put out the directive a month ago obama's now announced it the house
[2:42:09.360 --> 2:42:14.400]  passed it friday at thursday excuse me we read the bill on air it's now passed going to the senate
[2:42:14.400 --> 2:42:18.720]  sure to pass it they're saying there's no big debate about it only a few mainstream articles
[2:42:18.720 --> 2:42:24.800]  and we've covered it uh and they say that it they're setting up a body to organize the compulsory
[2:42:24.800 --> 2:42:31.600]  service of the american people from middle school to age sixty five and a one million person eighteen
[2:42:31.600 --> 2:42:37.760]  to twenty four uh cadre that will serve domestically and overseas and the army uh the the defense
[2:42:37.760 --> 2:42:42.160]  department directive uh states and we've read this on air the last three shows in a row read it
[2:42:42.160 --> 2:42:48.080]  last night it's up on president planet dot com a link to the pentagon they say it will be compulsory
[2:42:48.080 --> 2:42:54.560]  and they will tell you to be here or overseas i mean this is this is literal joseph stalin marcus
[2:42:54.560 --> 2:43:01.200]  wolf level yeah it's right in the open openly absolutely it's i mean but but it even amazes
[2:43:01.200 --> 2:43:09.280]  me alan that this quick this fast this this this this overwhelming i mean if if they were shooting
[2:43:09.280 --> 2:43:13.520]  for tyranny and there's a score of one to a hundred they are getting a one hundred and ten
[2:43:13.520 --> 2:43:18.960]  you know with a triple star's bonus yes i mean this is the yeah they have to go the whole way
[2:43:18.960 --> 2:43:23.920]  fast uh they can't just implement a stage at a time and take the flag they're trying to use a
[2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:30.480]  short tactic and ram it all through it once and and then uh deal with any comeback from it any fall
[2:43:30.480 --> 2:43:37.440]  back this is literally red dawn i mean this is classic military standing by watching the american
[2:43:37.440 --> 2:43:42.960]  people while the banks openly destroy the economy by design and openly announce world government
[2:43:43.520 --> 2:43:48.400]  that's right that's what that's what the world bank was set up to do in the united nations as well
[2:43:48.400 --> 2:43:53.360]  i got the books uh written at the time when they were setting up the un and they mentioned all these
[2:43:53.360 --> 2:43:59.280]  institutions and they said that probably the world bank will not come up to us to its uh full
[2:43:59.280 --> 2:44:06.320]  purpose power for about 50 years well we're right on target i know it's just amazing alan to know
[2:44:06.320 --> 2:44:10.000]  this and i want listeners understand something we've posted all the government bills all the
[2:44:10.000 --> 2:44:17.120]  documents this is real this is happening we're not exaggerating in fact it's so bad it's so huge
[2:44:17.680 --> 2:44:24.480]  that i can't even in one show list all of the evidence i mean it's admitted that they're doing
[2:44:24.480 --> 2:44:30.560]  this yes it's in the open this is a shotgun all tactic they're using because most people as you
[2:44:30.560 --> 2:44:36.640]  say cannot believe it is overwhelming and most of them um are not used most of the public truly
[2:44:36.640 --> 2:44:41.280]  honestly are not used to thinking about what they hear they cannot it's kind of it goes in one year
[2:44:41.280 --> 2:44:46.640]  out the other they won't believe it until their sons and daughters are whist off and they themselves
[2:44:46.640 --> 2:44:54.320]  are pushed in if they're under 65 or whatever into serving in some capacity or another well i mean
[2:44:54.320 --> 2:45:00.960]  i could go over it it's got an environment core environment core green core um security core
[2:45:03.040 --> 2:45:09.360]  in fact i've got it in my stack out there guys from last night show will you uh bring me the
[2:45:09.360 --> 2:45:13.600]  big huge stack over there on the table there's like five stacks it's the big one you know i'll get it
[2:45:13.600 --> 2:45:17.040]  during a break it doesn't matter you'll bring the wrong stack you couldn't know where it is it doesn't
[2:45:17.040 --> 2:45:21.520]  matter it's right over there on the conference table no no just forget it just forget it i don't
[2:45:21.520 --> 2:45:26.480]  want all the stacks there's like 50 stacks out there you know what's the point i mean i keep
[2:45:26.480 --> 2:45:31.280]  covering it giving them the subsections giving them where it where it says it how they're doing it
[2:45:31.280 --> 2:45:36.640]  it's just mind-blowing al and i keep saying that i mean don't people understand this is classic
[2:45:36.640 --> 2:45:44.080]  hardcore tyranny they don't just a generation has grown up really um living with with uh fantasy
[2:45:44.080 --> 2:45:49.840]  and virtual reality and the older generations been dying off those with memory of what tyranny was
[2:45:49.840 --> 2:45:55.760]  all about and therefore it's brand new again for this generation uh there's been almost
[2:45:55.760 --> 2:46:02.080]  mollycoddle to an extent for quite some time living in entertainment land and they cannot tell
[2:46:02.080 --> 2:46:07.600]  the difference between reality and fiction it's all blended together like some bizarre talk show
[2:46:08.320 --> 2:46:14.400]  on television so that's how their life is to most of them now in the 40s there was a guy
[2:46:14.400 --> 2:46:20.240]  an archbishop in fact of britain who wrote books and spoke on behalf of the united nations
[2:46:20.240 --> 2:46:26.080]  the coming united nations and he said eventually in 50 years he said we shall have a system of
[2:46:26.080 --> 2:46:31.600]  perpetual education from birth to death in other words you'd be like a kind of computer basically
[2:46:31.600 --> 2:46:36.080]  where you'd be upgraded throughout your entire life to learn the new normals and that's what
[2:46:36.080 --> 2:46:42.320]  george orville was talking about in 1984 the ability to believe everything you're told today
[2:46:42.320 --> 2:46:48.480]  you're you're given a new reality tomorrow you must delete your old reality so it never existed
[2:46:48.480 --> 2:46:54.720]  and be politically correct day by day week by week etc and that's why we're seeing that now
[2:46:54.720 --> 2:47:01.040]  with with the whole thing with um gulf war one and the gulf war two you start off with afghanistan
[2:47:01.040 --> 2:47:06.880]  they changed their sites into iraq then they changed it to iran now they're going for pakistan
[2:47:06.880 --> 2:47:11.840]  they keep changing their enemy who are fighting today east asia or west asia and you better
[2:47:11.840 --> 2:47:16.960]  believe it's always been west asia or whoever they tell you that's what's coming a hyperspeed
[2:47:17.760 --> 2:47:22.320]  constant upgrades to everybody to be politically correct at all times and they're going to
[2:47:22.320 --> 2:47:28.000]  monitor us to make to make sure that the program is working with us and we are upgraded all through
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:36.080]  our lives that's right the 20s 30s 40s 50s the different think tanks taba stock and the un and
[2:47:36.080 --> 2:47:43.200]  others bragged and we've read these documents on air that what they would do is bankrupt
[2:47:43.200 --> 2:47:47.840]  everybody get everybody dependent everybody institutionalized finally bankrupt the middle
[2:47:47.840 --> 2:47:54.240]  class and then your job will be continual education that's government paid for and then
[2:47:54.240 --> 2:47:58.560]  they'll put you in government jobs while the brainwashing and the continuing education
[2:47:58.560 --> 2:48:04.160]  continues always giving you the new reality downloading it and now that's what they admit
[2:48:04.160 --> 2:48:09.840]  the new world order is going to be is basically a giant reeducation camp and they play this off
[2:48:09.840 --> 2:48:14.800]  on these fools they tell them you've got to do what obama says or the economy won't get better
[2:48:14.800 --> 2:48:19.040]  it's the people that are fighting obama that are causing this to happen obama's fighting the
[2:48:19.040 --> 2:48:23.440]  special interest that's why 13 million of you need to go door to door banging on people's doors
[2:48:23.440 --> 2:48:30.240]  demanding they pledge to accept the banker takeover and these fools really believe they're
[2:48:30.240 --> 2:48:35.680]  fighting the establishment as they are part of this is the establishment openly is the author
[2:48:36.320 --> 2:48:42.400]  of the entire thing and and you talk to obama supporters and they say he never said he wasn't
[2:48:42.400 --> 2:48:46.800]  going to hire lobbyist he never said he wasn't going to you know bring the troops home he never
[2:48:46.800 --> 2:48:50.800]  said that you know he was going to do any of that and i go yes he did and they go no he didn't
[2:48:50.800 --> 2:48:54.640]  you're just an evil republican and you say no you're caught in the left right paradigm they
[2:48:54.640 --> 2:48:59.920]  control you with that bait and switch they go shut up republican you lost the election i won you
[2:48:59.920 --> 2:49:07.200]  know they i see that in the comments on my film online is every other comment that disagrees says
[2:49:07.200 --> 2:49:11.840]  hey get over it you lost republicans get over it obama's going to beat you you know what we're
[2:49:11.840 --> 2:49:16.000]  going to arrest you right wingers you know he's going to bring in a heaven i'm not going to have
[2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:21.040]  bills anymore and in a way they're not they're going to be in little uniforms and little brigades on
[2:49:21.040 --> 2:49:27.600]  power trips uh you know totally dumbed down fluoride heads adi q's just just totally going
[2:49:27.600 --> 2:49:33.040]  insane just like hitler's brown shirts that there's no doubt this is a formula what you're
[2:49:33.040 --> 2:49:38.720]  seeing is a formula as well tried and tested over centuries many centuries and they know
[2:49:38.720 --> 2:49:44.320]  exactly how to implement it as i say it's obvious that the whole formula was set up in
[2:49:44.320 --> 2:49:48.400]  the machinery to implement it was set up before long before obama was even heard of
[2:49:50.160 --> 2:49:54.720]  alan what do we do time this takes time to get going this is rolling already
[2:49:54.720 --> 2:49:59.280]  i even you know yourself when you put something forward before it becomes a bill or anything
[2:49:59.280 --> 2:50:04.480]  else it takes it takes them sometimes years to get through all the different details etc back to

[2:54:32.880 --> 2:54:37.920]  movie faces nine of the nation's toughest critics the supreme court the justice review of the slashing
[2:54:37.920 --> 2:54:42.560]  documentary financed by longtime critics of secretary of state hillary rodham clinton could
[2:54:42.560 --> 2:54:46.800]  bring more than just thumbs up or thumbs down it may settle the question of whether the government
[2:54:46.800 --> 2:54:52.720]  can regulate a politically charged film as a campaign ad and they go on to say uh the former
[2:54:52.720 --> 2:54:58.080]  republican congressional lady produced the clinton movie another described then senator barack obama
[2:54:58.080 --> 2:55:03.120]  as an overhyped media darling oh is that allowed said that his films are about important moments
[2:55:03.120 --> 2:55:07.200]  in american politics the outcome of this case will dictate how we're able to make films and educate
[2:55:07.200 --> 2:55:12.720]  people about them at issue is the case being argued before justices tomorrow is the 90 minute anti clinton
[2:55:12.720 --> 2:55:19.760]  movie and television ads uh bossy wanted to air during 2008 primaries advertising the films so see
[2:55:19.760 --> 2:55:24.560]  all the big money can spend two billion dollars outside of the regular campaign money and the
[2:55:24.560 --> 2:55:29.360]  fake global warming ads and all of it that's okay they can run political ads to get obama
[2:55:29.360 --> 2:55:35.600]  an army of supporters that's okay but see they're going to selectively enforce and set the precedent
[2:55:35.600 --> 2:55:38.960]  bossy's group the conservative citizens united released the movie is the clinton's
[2:55:39.680 --> 2:55:43.760]  a new york senator was competing with obama for democratic presidential nomination the movie is
[2:55:43.760 --> 2:55:48.640]  unquestionably anti obama featuring commentary for conservative pundits some of whom specifically
[2:55:48.640 --> 2:55:53.520]  say clinton was not fit to be commander-in-chief imagine america having free speech one scene
[2:55:53.520 --> 2:55:58.080]  which was used in the ad as dick morris a former advisor to clinton who is now critic of the clinton
[2:55:58.080 --> 2:56:03.440]  saying the senator is a closest thing we have in america to a european socialist the movie was
[2:56:03.440 --> 2:56:08.480]  shown in eight theaters oh my gosh and it goes federal court said the ads would violate mccain's
[2:56:08.480 --> 2:56:13.840]  fine gold law the popular name for 2002 revisions of the nation's campaign finance law and that law
[2:56:13.840 --> 2:56:18.400]  says basically no free speech i can't say i'm pro gun that's political i can't say i'm pro border
[2:56:18.400 --> 2:56:24.480]  that's political ellen watt your comments on this i mean this and the ap reports it like oh it's
[2:56:24.480 --> 2:56:29.280]  reasonable this is unquestionably anti clinton maybe this shouldn't be allowed i mean this is
[2:56:29.280 --> 2:56:34.880]  outrageous that they're even proposing this it again it falls right in they want to get the
[2:56:34.880 --> 2:56:41.840]  message out there to the public to just be a good little citizen and be quiet and leave everything
[2:56:41.840 --> 2:56:48.240]  to government and government agencies have no opinion and definitely don't try to uh encroach
[2:56:48.240 --> 2:56:53.600]  upon what they see is their territory now they'll give the propaganda no one else can give propaganda
[2:56:53.600 --> 2:57:00.480]  uh that's happening too to john anthony hill in ireland he was a guy who did 77 ripple effect
[2:57:00.480 --> 2:57:07.120]  about the about the bombings and he used clips all through the from regular television bbc and so on
[2:57:07.120 --> 2:57:13.120]  strung it all together asked the right questions but he did apparently at least accused of sending
[2:57:13.120 --> 2:57:19.200]  out the videos to the judge and the jury and he's up on on basically uh terrorism charges to be
[2:57:19.200 --> 2:57:23.920]  extradited from ireland for making that movie basically and uh is to be taken off the west
[2:57:23.920 --> 2:57:28.880]  minister which is the terrorism court for europe basically at the moment and so they're getting
[2:57:28.880 --> 2:57:33.280]  the message out in all the countries now you just can't go ahead and do this kind of stuff
[2:57:33.280 --> 2:57:38.720]  on your own don't interfere on our territory this is our territory uh you will be put in the slammer
[2:57:38.720 --> 2:57:44.240]  for life and that's the charge against them hey we've had the fbi calling this office asking his
[2:57:44.240 --> 2:57:49.440]  questions concerning how we put out the obama deception and things i mean they are really
[2:57:49.440 --> 2:57:53.600]  trying to intimidate right now yes they are they're they're going to make sure that eventually
[2:57:53.600 --> 2:57:58.480]  they will take it make examples of different people and as i see this one in ireland if this
[2:57:58.480 --> 2:58:04.880]  goes through that he's attempting to prevent the course of justice is the charge he faces life in
[2:58:04.880 --> 2:58:11.920]  prison life yeah and it's an excellent film 77 ripple effect folks documenting because he has
[2:58:11.920 --> 2:58:18.960]  the newscast where they killed the patsies the supposed bombers who they hired for an anti-terror
[2:58:18.960 --> 2:58:23.600]  drill which they admit they were running a bombing the exact same trains and buses at the exact same
[2:58:23.600 --> 2:58:30.720]  time very effective film and boy he's on his way to life in prison right now uh just unbelievable

[3:00:10.960 --> 3:00:14.960]  a couple hours with jason bermas so that'll be a different style of interviewing they'll be taking
[3:00:14.960 --> 3:00:20.080]  calls as well then we have an hour left alan i've thrown out a lot of articles and topics i
[3:00:20.080 --> 3:00:24.800]  wanted you to comment on i want to get into the global economic meltdown where that's going but
[3:00:24.800 --> 3:00:31.280]  first solutions studying the enemy's programming how they brainwash how they condition the public
[3:00:32.320 --> 3:00:36.880]  how do we reach out to them because you're right there's a blitzkrieg motion as they hit us with
[3:00:36.880 --> 3:00:42.880]  all their world government operations they've built up they've prepared militarily psychologically
[3:00:42.880 --> 3:00:49.040]  economically now at one time they're launching at every level past a national draft friday about
[3:00:49.040 --> 3:00:53.040]  to pass the senate i mean again i should be talking about nothing but that we're being hit from every
[3:00:53.040 --> 3:00:58.880]  angle uh and i see a lot of tactics you know they're still doing a lot of this covertly
[3:00:58.880 --> 3:01:02.160]  it you know it's it's public but but they're not giving any attention other things they're
[3:01:02.160 --> 3:01:07.120]  admitting to how do we reach out to people how do we get the people to rally against this now
[3:01:07.120 --> 3:01:14.960]  it's it's a hard thing uh jibrasinski and others that there are masters of studying
[3:01:16.160 --> 3:01:23.600]  masses the masses they call it human psychology know that um and he said in his own book
[3:01:25.680 --> 3:01:31.040]  the between two ages he said most of the public shortly will be unable to think or reason for
[3:01:31.040 --> 3:01:37.680]  themselves they'll expect the mainstream media to do it for them that's our problem uh our generations
[3:01:37.680 --> 3:01:42.720]  grown up and they truly believe everything that's given to them on television if it's not been on
[3:01:42.720 --> 3:01:47.840]  television and you bring up the topic even if you have the evidence in front of you they'll dismiss
[3:01:47.840 --> 3:01:55.280]  it so we're dealing with with the psychological warfare and its impact and its effects most people
[3:01:55.280 --> 3:02:01.040]  unfortunately as i say won't react until it hits them personally at their doorstep or on their doorstep
[3:02:03.520 --> 3:02:08.480]  the constitution was the only thing really that gave you any protection that you could at least
[3:02:08.480 --> 3:02:13.680]  say hey look here you gotta change this or throw it out legally before you can come in with a new
[3:02:13.680 --> 3:02:20.000]  system and if effectively bypass that and basically ignored it the public never know what they have
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:24.640]  until they lose it unfortunately and if they're not willing to stand up for something now
[3:02:24.640 --> 3:02:30.000]  uh they never will you can't stand up for something when you're in prison camps behind barbed wire
[3:02:30.640 --> 3:02:37.040]  you've had it by then and remember they're talking about a hundred years war that that was said
[3:02:37.040 --> 3:02:42.000]  right after 9 11 this is going to be a hundred years war and that was never explained these
[3:02:42.000 --> 3:02:47.920]  little phrases come out but it's never explained to the general public they expect to achieve their
[3:02:47.920 --> 3:02:54.400]  whole goal of eugenics depopulation that totally controls society etc to be over
[3:02:54.400 --> 3:03:01.680]  and completed and done with in a hundred years but to be a hundred years war and i said years ago
[3:03:01.680 --> 3:03:07.280]  after 9 11 happened i said this is a war remember that declared a war which means you have one of
[3:03:07.280 --> 3:03:14.640]  ration cards uh scarcity of food um uh to be in control of the economic system like all wars
[3:03:14.640 --> 3:03:21.200]  are they'll have conscription etc etc etc and notice i gotta stop you hold the thought now in
[3:03:21.200 --> 3:03:26.160]  england the u.s in in in california they shut off the three big water supplies for different
[3:03:26.160 --> 3:03:30.800]  fish and things they claim are endangered suddenly they got they have to ration water in england
[3:03:30.800 --> 3:03:35.440]  the head of the operation and one telegraph this weekend said we're going to ration water not just
[3:03:35.440 --> 3:03:40.480]  carbon footprint but but uh water footprint training you to have less even though england has
[3:03:40.480 --> 3:03:45.920]  more water than any other country per capita in the world uh they are literally bringing control
[3:03:45.920 --> 3:03:52.240]  into every facet and they're saying ration cards have had the top eugenicist on who consulted the
[3:03:52.240 --> 3:03:58.400]  un they're in the headline saying we're all going to have ration cards for our carbon footprint i mean
[3:03:58.400 --> 3:04:03.280]  and the bureaucrats in our homes ruling us and now obama they've introduced bills to basically
[3:04:03.280 --> 3:04:07.920]  ban all gardens without licenses i mean it's all happening yes and they can come into your house

[3:04:19.280 --> 3:04:22.720]  yeah that was in the news this weekend and they announced it like it's good
[3:04:22.720 --> 3:04:27.520]  that's right and the bill in in the u.s to do with with agriculture etc will affect the home
[3:04:27.520 --> 3:04:33.120]  gardener and as a clause in there too it says and all uh food preparation facilities that includes
[3:04:33.120 --> 3:04:39.440]  your kitchen folks oh no in fact they've had committee hearings the bill says everything
[3:04:39.440 --> 3:04:44.960]  a tomato plant folks they say they will use swat teams and notice they're already beta testing
[3:04:44.960 --> 3:04:50.480]  swat teaming people selling eggs on the road selling watermelons i mean that's what stalin did

[3:08:11.200 --> 3:08:16.480]  savage came out two weeks ago and said that he believes obama's controllers will stage
[3:08:16.480 --> 3:08:24.400]  rice stacked terror attacks the united states to bring in marshal law that's a big deal i was
[3:08:24.400 --> 3:08:28.560]  picking some food up last night on the way home and ran into folks there at the bar where i was
[3:08:28.560 --> 3:08:32.560]  getting the food who were listeners of this show and savage and they they had heard that and that
[3:08:32.560 --> 3:08:40.080]  really really shocked them uh we have the army's own manuals where they teach army captains how
[3:08:40.080 --> 3:08:46.480]  to stage terror attacks i mean this is as much a part of their daily operation as
[3:08:46.480 --> 3:08:54.320]  anything i mean as their canteen as their m16 remember the globalist stage 9-11
[3:08:55.440 --> 3:09:00.400]  and they killed a million 300 000 iraqis of brazinski in two books one he published last
[3:09:00.400 --> 3:09:06.960]  year brags that the u.s uh funded uh the kameroosian pole pot that killed 35 percent of their population
[3:09:06.960 --> 3:09:12.240]  three million people they don't care about you either you understand that your little world my
[3:09:12.240 --> 3:09:16.400]  little world having things that are nice having liberty being treated with respect by the government
[3:09:16.400 --> 3:09:21.280]  it's all over they're not doing the slow socialist move anymore that was to get us domesticated to
[3:09:21.280 --> 3:09:26.160]  get us bankrupt to get us under control they're moving with the hot war now and so instead of
[3:09:26.160 --> 3:09:29.520]  the amount of changes you'd see in 30 40 years you'll now see in a year
[3:09:31.920 --> 3:09:35.680]  they're making their big move folks and they are going to take your pension funds everything
[3:09:35.680 --> 3:09:42.160]  you've got millions will end up serving them and being their minions for a paltry sum this is like
[3:09:42.160 --> 3:09:48.240]  the soviet union or nazi germany or mausetunk china in fact if you really study what obama's
[3:09:48.240 --> 3:09:54.560]  doing it's more akin to the refining of the Stalinist error with the malice error and that's
[3:09:54.560 --> 3:09:59.920]  what he's setting up these youth brigades i mean this is happening they passed the draft the nash
[3:09:59.920 --> 3:10:04.800]  which is an expansive draft making middle school students work for the feds high school
[3:10:05.520 --> 3:10:09.200]  18 to 24 serving in a new domestic military that'll also be deployed overseas
[3:10:09.200 --> 3:10:15.600]  and these idiots signing up for obama's system they don't know they're about to be conscripted
[3:10:15.600 --> 3:10:22.400]  but he's also going to have his separate outside the government army and ellen what i mean you
[3:10:22.400 --> 3:10:25.760]  know you brought the fact that they're accelerating everything right now and this is a blitzkrieg
[3:10:26.880 --> 3:10:30.320]  i want that to really sink into lizards can you speak to that more and then get into the type
[3:10:30.320 --> 3:10:36.560]  of plant society shutting down the gardens everything you talked about yes in fact it was
[3:10:36.560 --> 3:10:42.880]  a politician in holland that a couple years ago said that this new order it basically is like a big
[3:10:42.880 --> 3:10:51.120]  ship in a rough sea and every country is on board with this direction of the ship and all kinds all
[3:10:51.120 --> 3:10:55.440]  kinds of countries from third world to first world countries are all on board the ship and
[3:10:55.440 --> 3:10:59.840]  first before the third world countries were down below decks now they're everybody's on top of the
[3:10:59.840 --> 3:11:05.760]  deck mixed together and the captains of the ship have to keep on course with where they're going
[3:11:05.760 --> 3:11:09.360]  this is the terminology that's used with the council on foreign relations
[3:11:10.000 --> 3:11:14.080]  we understand that it was set up with the goal of bringing in world government
[3:11:14.080 --> 3:11:18.480]  and in their mandates in their charter they basically say that they're going to bring in a
[3:11:18.480 --> 3:11:26.320]  world where everyone will serve the world state service service service and gradually through
[3:11:26.320 --> 3:11:31.520]  the warfare and all the rest of it they're introducing service perpetual lifelong service to
[3:11:31.520 --> 3:11:37.200]  the world state that will be your purpose for living in fact will be to serve the world state
[3:11:37.200 --> 3:11:42.000]  and that's with why they're going ahead now with this they will grab many people who have
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:46.960]  been outspoken about this to make examples often to make sure the rest of them get it
[3:11:46.960 --> 3:11:51.520]  because of incredible sentences to make sure it terrifies everyone just as it did in the
[3:11:51.520 --> 3:11:56.240]  Soviet Union and we can't allow that to happen we've got to speak up now because once this
[3:11:56.240 --> 3:12:00.720]  happened once they start waiting your streets and grabbing your neighbors and hauling them off in
[3:12:00.720 --> 3:12:05.520]  front of the whole street to turn out the whole street to witness it um you'll end up with the
[3:12:05.520 --> 3:12:10.400]  Soviets where you be ashamed of yourself because secretly you're glad they took your neighbors
[3:12:10.400 --> 3:12:16.480]  and not yourself that's the state you end up being in under fear of eternity and they cannot
[3:12:16.480 --> 3:12:24.160]  allow this to happen it must not even start to happen well you're absolutely right you know
[3:12:24.160 --> 3:12:28.640]  i'm just looking at info wars dot com headlines and it says department of homeland security
[3:12:28.640 --> 3:12:34.880]  investigating large ammunition purchases so now homeland security was supposedly going to fight
[3:12:34.880 --> 3:12:40.080]  al-qaeda it is now looking at who's been ordering lots of ammo so if you stockpilot or think it's
[3:12:40.080 --> 3:12:46.240]  a good investment to sell later uh they're now saying that uh the owner of uh namax sport shop
[3:12:46.240 --> 3:12:52.080]  and farm and garden center in warrensburg said gun sales at his business began to increase
[3:12:52.080 --> 3:12:56.320]  and then it goes on to say that homeland security is there now trying to track who's buying ammo
[3:12:56.320 --> 3:13:01.040]  and then all over the country the feds are saying if you want your stimulus package money in your
[3:13:01.040 --> 3:13:07.120]  county you got to pass a law to register people when they buy ammo um then i have another article
[3:13:07.120 --> 3:13:11.920]  here from the council and farm relations where general james jones uh one of the heads of the
[3:13:11.920 --> 3:13:17.200]  national security council says i take my orders from henry kissinger who's not even part of the
[3:13:17.200 --> 3:13:22.320]  government notice who is the chief advisor to the vatican chief advisor to bush senior chief advisor
[3:13:22.320 --> 3:13:27.600]  to clinton chief advisor uh to nixon i mean how can these obama people think there's any difference
[3:13:28.160 --> 3:13:33.360]  when it's right out in the open that the same people are running the show i know and they are
[3:13:34.400 --> 3:13:39.200]  again multiple back to the council and farm relations and put professor carl quickly said he
[3:13:39.200 --> 3:13:46.160]  said the world is now run by technocrats unelected people who are in contact with all the leaders
[3:13:46.160 --> 3:13:51.520]  the elected leaders and he said that these technocrats go behind the scenes do all the real work
[3:13:51.520 --> 3:13:57.120]  they have the real power they're not responsible to the public but they basically advise all the
[3:13:57.120 --> 3:14:02.480]  presidents and prime ministers what to do and that's a fact that's what we truly have and it's
[3:14:02.480 --> 3:14:07.440]  i've got the same article uh with with him uh saying that he gets his orders from kissinger
[3:14:07.440 --> 3:14:12.240]  you're quite right and that's from it presents you to yeah yeah that's from the council and
[3:14:12.240 --> 3:14:18.080]  farm relations bragging just absolutely no change with obama look at this department of
[3:14:18.080 --> 3:14:24.080]  homeland security investigating large ammunition purchases here's another one video obama supporters
[3:14:24.080 --> 3:14:30.720]  go door to door guys pull that up it's the second the third story that comes up uh in the little
[3:14:30.720 --> 3:14:38.000]  news box right there here's another one serb death leader squad commander uh cia operative
[3:14:39.440 --> 3:14:44.720]  man i tell you this is just anyone for 20 years he was the top double agent for 20 years yeah
[3:14:44.720 --> 3:14:50.000]  absolutely and then when they were ready to betray him they did that's all these people do
[3:14:53.600 --> 3:15:00.560]  this is incredible just continue allen i always tell young people regardless of the ethnic
[3:15:00.560 --> 3:15:06.240]  background that you're in don't join groups that are advocating of violence because you're being
[3:15:06.240 --> 3:15:13.280]  set up as patsies they got it now bring forth terrorism and maybe on a continual basis so
[3:15:13.280 --> 3:15:18.480]  we're so used to hearing something getting blown up this week or next week or whatever um that is
[3:15:18.480 --> 3:15:23.440]  it's normal they want to make this normal but they've got to find terrorists or create them
[3:15:23.440 --> 3:15:28.080]  that's their choice you either find the terrorists or you create terrorists well let me add here i mean
[3:15:28.080 --> 3:15:32.880]  they're saying homeland securities for the american people the armies is being used against the american
[3:15:32.880 --> 3:15:38.400]  people this is out of the post star they're now saying you may be a terrorist if you buy a bunch
[3:15:38.400 --> 3:15:42.240]  of ammo so again they're scared of folks buying lots of ammo so they're saying okay we're gonna
[3:15:42.240 --> 3:15:47.520]  put you on terror list if you do this as an attempt at a chilling effect i don't see this working
[3:15:47.520 --> 3:15:52.960]  i see this accelerating gun and ammo sales it probably will it probably will let people have
[3:15:52.960 --> 3:15:58.960]  to the sense not to be intimidated you either keep your way of living or you give it up as
[3:15:58.960 --> 3:16:03.680]  as simple as that you keep your way of living or give it up and comply and if we can buy you're
[3:16:03.680 --> 3:16:08.800]  defeated yeah i was about to say it exactly if you comply you're defeated i was about to echo that
[3:16:08.800 --> 3:16:14.080]  that we must say no we're not doing anything wrong protesting the fellow reserve or anything wrong
[3:16:14.080 --> 3:16:19.600]  buying lots of ammo you are the criminals i mean they're the criminals don't want us armed down
[3:16:19.600 --> 3:16:25.200]  and go ahead well that's obvious but uh it's been stated many times over the past uh
[3:16:25.200 --> 3:16:31.920]  they'd have to disarm the american people to fulfill their agenda and uh that is true i mean
[3:16:31.920 --> 3:16:36.480]  even if the people are not organized as i say towards the end if this goes ahead and steam
[3:16:36.480 --> 3:16:41.840]  rows ahead you are going to see famine because of five agribusinesses control all the food
[3:16:41.840 --> 3:16:46.720]  they won't allow you to grow it grow your own and they are going to toss more and more people out on
[3:16:46.720 --> 3:16:51.360]  the streets as a loser homes and so on and people are going to get very very angry they don't want
[3:16:51.360 --> 3:16:56.240]  people who can fight even if it's in desperation or their frantic they don't want that they want
[3:16:56.240 --> 3:17:02.880]  to be they want a peaceable takedown of the country compliance is what they want listen to this
[3:17:02.880 --> 3:17:08.400]  this one northern warren county resident found out recently the government is paying attention
[3:17:08.400 --> 3:17:13.760]  to such ammo sales west said a customer of his recently stocked up on two two three caliber
[3:17:13.760 --> 3:17:19.040]  rounds a caliber often using assault weapons the customer brought one thousand rounds of ammo
[3:17:19.040 --> 3:17:23.040]  i've done that a few months ago through a mail order company shortly after the purchase he
[3:17:23.040 --> 3:17:26.640]  received a visit from the u.s department of homeland security whose interest was apparently
[3:17:26.640 --> 3:17:33.120]  uh... connected by a large sale purchase of the caliber his wife was home he was a church people
[3:17:33.120 --> 3:17:37.280]  are buying a lot of ammo and so they just throw that in there
[3:17:37.280 --> 3:17:41.760]  that's right so what was normal at one time send all other guys in the states we go out to the
[3:17:41.760 --> 3:17:46.960]  to the ranges there and just blast off a whole case at times spend the whole day at that's how
[3:17:46.960 --> 3:17:51.360]  you buy them cheaper that's how you buy them cheaper yeah that's right and so again that
[3:17:51.360 --> 3:17:56.880]  that was the usual a way of living and they want you to change it all to suit them for what's
[3:17:56.880 --> 3:18:00.960]  coming down the pike that's so obvious yeah well i mean they've built this giant homeland
[3:18:00.960 --> 3:18:05.200]  security apparatus took it over said the congress runs nothing the federal reserve goes on tv and
[3:18:05.200 --> 3:18:08.880]  congress says we run everything you can't question us they openly announced their tyranny
[3:18:08.880 --> 3:18:12.800]  and plain view like it's no big deal to set the precedent and they announced the army the police
[3:18:12.800 --> 3:18:17.120]  homeland security we're watching gun owners we're watching all of you your terrorist and they tell
[3:18:17.120 --> 3:18:21.520]  the cops these gun owners want to kill you i mean that's in the mike report these gun owners want
[3:18:21.520 --> 3:18:25.200]  to murder officers and then they're going to send the cops out for the guns and they're going to
[3:18:25.200 --> 3:18:30.080]  get killed which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and the cops won't think well why is this happening
[3:18:30.080 --> 3:18:35.200]  to me that's correct but unfortunately too we've got our generation drawn up what playing video
[3:18:35.200 --> 3:18:41.120]  games who want to wear those black uniforms and they want to go and kill people i mean these people
[3:18:41.120 --> 3:18:47.840]  really do exist they're brainwashed to be gung-ho killers and so this would be not a long-term
[3:18:47.840 --> 3:18:52.240]  preparation we're going to understand that this isn't just happening now uh and it's all this
[3:18:52.240 --> 3:18:58.080]  associated this has been long-term planning that's why they created one generation to grow up be in
[3:18:58.080 --> 3:19:04.480]  their 20s join the black clad outfit guys and ninjas and they're rusting for blood is because
[3:19:04.480 --> 3:19:09.280]  getting to take part in a real video game and really kill people that's high on their agenda
[3:19:09.280 --> 3:19:15.840]  well i've found the main programming tv show is gi joe in fact i think i sent a clip this weekend to

[3:21:13.520 --> 3:21:19.440]  say the obama deception completely destroys the myth that obama is working for the best interest
[3:21:19.440 --> 3:21:25.120]  of the american people while obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election
[3:21:25.120 --> 3:21:30.400]  if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing

[3:24:28.480 --> 3:24:32.720]  secret army police watching myself and others at the end the fed demonstration in dallas
[3:24:35.120 --> 3:24:40.800]  this just in uk population must fall to 30 million says porit jonathan porit of gordon
[3:24:40.800 --> 3:24:45.440]  brown's leading green advisers is to warn the britain britain must drastically reduce his population
[3:24:45.440 --> 3:24:50.000]  doesn't matter if the british population only has 1.5 children for every two people they don't even
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:56.160]  replace them the average in europe's 1.3 europe's dying japan's dying the population is going to
[3:24:56.160 --> 3:25:01.040]  plane off at 8 billion the third world still exploding this is the eugenesis times of london
[3:25:02.080 --> 3:25:05.840]  there you go right there on my friend they say they're bringing in big government so they can
[3:25:05.840 --> 3:25:10.960]  basically with water rationing and food rationing make people so poor they can't afford to have
[3:25:10.960 --> 3:25:18.640]  children and be in a one child policy alan what that was gone through by charles golden darwin
[3:25:18.640 --> 3:25:24.320]  in the 50s when he published his book the next million years on behalf and by the way he has a
[3:25:25.200 --> 3:25:30.000]  a society still going a eugenics society they call themselves the british eugenics society
[3:25:30.560 --> 3:25:34.880]  initially they said we can tempt them to go out to the material goods so what we'll have an age
[3:25:34.880 --> 3:25:40.160]  of plenty but eventually you said that would be too hard on resources so they'd have to do the other
[3:25:40.160 --> 3:25:46.720]  way around and basically you see bring them into poverty this was planned 50 years ago now that's
[3:25:46.720 --> 3:25:53.920]  a cut of 50 percent yes and it won't stop there mind you that's just to get get up the bottle
[3:25:53.920 --> 3:25:59.040]  rolling oh because they want to really bring down the population of the of the planet almost 90
[3:25:59.040 --> 3:26:04.880]  percent right yeah i've always seen their documents for the public they always say 50 percent uh in
[3:26:04.880 --> 3:26:10.000]  their mainline documents they say 80 percent and then in their internal documents that we've gotten
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:15.680]  they say 99 percent of us will be exterminated that's right and plus you have the military uh
[3:26:15.680 --> 3:26:23.040]  think tanks for britain and the u.s both both on board uh with the depopulation agenda so they have
[3:26:23.040 --> 3:26:29.120]  eugenics in the military's teachings at the higher level so this is a must be on their behalf uh
[3:26:29.120 --> 3:26:34.640]  there's nothing happenstance about it it is it is all related it's all what we have is a pyramid
[3:26:34.640 --> 3:26:39.440]  with a capstone running the whole kitten caboodle underneath it that's what we have and that's why
[3:26:39.440 --> 3:26:44.560]  they give the troops the delayed cancer virus injections that kill them by age 55 to 60 that's
[3:26:44.560 --> 3:26:48.400]  even come out in documents in the higher ups say well we've got to kill the troops you know we don't
[3:26:48.400 --> 3:26:54.160]  have to pay for them when they get old uh this is the socialist uh a model and now they've just
[3:26:54.160 --> 3:26:59.200]  got his condition yeah hp v shots killing people and the bird flu vaccines killing people and they
[3:26:59.200 --> 3:27:03.520]  just get us kind of normalized well yeah we make you take the shot and then you die or get paralyzed
[3:27:03.520 --> 3:27:08.240]  it's kind of like you're not an extremist are you take the shot and die we love you it's for your
[3:27:08.240 --> 3:27:15.440]  safety i mean again it's just total normalization of insanity it is that's how it works it's
[3:27:15.440 --> 3:27:21.200]  insidious to begin with as long term a lot is done in secret uh the sterilization of meals has
[3:27:21.200 --> 3:27:26.560]  been going on in the western world for 50 years and all the medical societies now come out and
[3:27:26.560 --> 3:27:32.800]  admit it they've known this for 50 is suddenly started about 50 years ago suddenly and uh most
[3:27:32.800 --> 3:27:39.920]  men now are going up 2 percent volatile sperm that's right just a decade ago it was 75 percent
[3:27:39.920 --> 3:27:44.800]  now in many areas of europe in the u.s 98 percent sperm reduction the women can't have kids
[3:27:45.680 --> 3:27:50.080]  and it's directly tied to the i mean they are hitting folks you are under bio weapon attack
[3:27:50.640 --> 3:27:55.120]  there's hundreds of different combos of cheap plastic they chose the one formula 60 years ago
[3:27:55.120 --> 3:28:02.320]  for universal uh adoption the one type that leaches the exact estrogen mimicar that sterilizes men
[3:28:03.200 --> 3:28:08.880]  and they also made sure that all baby formulas were rinsed the sterilizer supposedly with the same
[3:28:08.880 --> 3:28:14.080]  formula so they hit them right at birth yeah and then we expose it's killing the kids in thousands
[3:28:14.080 --> 3:28:19.840]  mainstream news and they say we decided melamine's good for babies yes and it was put out by the
[3:28:19.840 --> 3:28:24.480]  melamine society that works with the european union every study that put out comes from the
[3:28:24.480 --> 3:28:30.000]  society that owns the companies that put it in the food so you wonder why you're down to cancer
[3:28:30.000 --> 3:28:34.160]  why your kids are sterile or retarded and you just still love the government you'll line up at your

[3:37:59.120 --> 3:38:05.120]  y'all these cartoons uh really uh it's even worse today if you're watching it the cartoons for
[3:38:05.120 --> 3:38:12.080]  children is full of programming and uh and messages of four watts to come and again we've got to realize
[3:38:12.080 --> 3:38:18.720]  that the big boys wrote about this extensively in the 40s 50s 60s all through that they'd use all
[3:38:18.720 --> 3:38:25.200]  media uh to get their message across by the way fox news is now put out a 10 minute promo piece
[3:38:25.200 --> 3:38:30.880]  admitting they're planting pro global warming eugenics ads in all their tv shows and and and
[3:38:30.880 --> 3:38:37.520]  media so this is now admitted explain to people what predictive programming is creative programming
[3:38:37.520 --> 3:38:44.320]  the technique developed and perfected at tavistock institutes in london on behalf of the british
[3:38:44.320 --> 3:38:51.760]  oligarchy that runs that brit always has run britain and the idea is very simple it's through
[3:38:51.760 --> 3:38:56.800]  fiction through the works of fiction where you're getting crossed in a story and the male will
[3:38:56.800 --> 3:39:03.440]  identify with the hero the woman with the with the heroine and you want your hoops and emotional
[3:39:03.440 --> 3:39:09.520]  stories generally bad guys on the run from the good guys who go after them with overwhelming force
[3:39:09.520 --> 3:39:15.440]  that they then tuck in uh the prediction of what's to come you'll see things that still to come like
[3:39:15.440 --> 3:39:20.320]  like cops smashing down doors no warrants all that kind of stuff will be in the story and you won't
[3:39:20.320 --> 3:39:26.080]  mind because this guy thereafter is the worst mass murderer pedophile you can ever imagine and
[3:39:26.080 --> 3:39:31.280]  therefore you accept all the things you're seeing where the law itself is disregarded to get this
[3:39:31.280 --> 3:39:37.040]  bad guy therefore when it happens in real life you're familiar with the idea and you ask no questions
[3:39:37.040 --> 3:39:43.280]  it seems quite natural to you to see it happen in real life just the same way it was in the fictional
[3:39:43.280 --> 3:39:49.600]  movies or television drama series they're using them now to to full force every country has its
[3:39:49.600 --> 3:39:56.720]  its um anti-terrorism dramas ongoing dramas uh britain has them canada even has one uh where
[3:39:56.720 --> 3:40:01.600]  they send off jets to the to the border to the bridges to to guard against terrorism and there's
[3:40:01.600 --> 3:40:06.800]  a tremendous uh threat avoid and in the show spooks in england and all these shows here they
[3:40:06.800 --> 3:40:11.280]  torture people's children to get answers then that stops the nuke from going off so torturing
[3:40:11.280 --> 3:40:15.200]  children's good then it comes out in the media they are torturing people's children for fake
[3:40:15.200 --> 3:40:21.360]  confessions uh all of it getting everybody ready all these new movies about you take the vaccine
[3:40:21.360 --> 3:40:27.120]  and it actually kills you uh like i am legend uh so then we also talk about it they say oh you
[3:40:27.120 --> 3:40:32.960]  got that from a movie yeah yeah or people who watch the movies and enjoy the series will
[3:40:32.960 --> 3:40:37.600]  will say well so what because they really they've already been programmed they have been programmed
[3:40:37.600 --> 3:40:42.560]  that this is all quite normal to them we'll take my pd blue and all these other shows every episode
[3:40:42.560 --> 3:40:48.720]  the cops beat somebody but but the guy's always guilty it was right to do it exactly mass conditioning
[3:40:48.720 --> 3:40:54.160]  mass because as mammals we accept what we see on tv is the way we're supposed to behave as
[3:40:54.160 --> 3:41:00.480]  pack creatures very very serious folks uh let's go ahead and play the new gi joe to everybody to
[3:41:00.480 --> 3:41:05.920]  join the military it's an army unit you get to be a superhero if you have it uh and again you're
[3:41:05.920 --> 3:41:20.480]  fighting the wicked cobra so uh here it is when i'm finished the world will never forget
[3:41:20.480 --> 3:41:29.280]  make the call we don't exist we answer to no one and when all else fails
[3:41:29.280 --> 3:41:35.280]  we don't what did you say your unit was called i didn't
[3:41:39.920 --> 3:41:45.520]  gi joe the rise of cobra now in real life the special combat applications group
[3:41:45.520 --> 3:41:49.280]  dealt the force and others run around dealing drugs killing people buying off local governments
[3:41:49.280 --> 3:41:53.680]  overthrowing governments taking over the u.s but here they're heroes fighting the evil terrorist
[3:41:53.680 --> 3:42:02.240]  alan what i don't think it's working anymore though and no it's not so there are people who
[3:42:02.240 --> 3:42:07.520]  have caught on to it and have nowhere for a few years because it has got rather blatant uh
[3:42:07.520 --> 3:42:11.280]  people who often watch television for a few years and suddenly switch it on you wonder
[3:42:11.280 --> 3:42:16.400]  what's world you're in because you you see the programming very easily very easily if you've
[3:42:16.400 --> 3:42:21.040]  been away from television for a while those who continuously watch television they don't notice
[3:42:21.040 --> 3:42:24.960]  the changes at all that's right and and they don't really care they'll say well they'll
[3:42:24.960 --> 3:42:28.800]  please have to do this well they've been seeing that because that's right the drama is the one
[3:42:28.800 --> 3:42:33.920]  that's right if you don't watch a lot of tv you miss all the little sub downloads slowly changing
[3:42:33.920 --> 3:42:40.160]  your view and and then it's very disjointed and you're like whoa so i guess the first step is
[3:42:40.160 --> 3:42:44.480]  stop watching mainstream television i want to go to calls i'm going to play the cnn clip we're
[3:42:44.480 --> 3:42:48.880]  going to do 20 minutes of overdrive only at prison planet dot tv and the info wars dot com
[3:42:48.880 --> 3:42:53.520]  streams coming up at the end of the show in a t-minus 18 minutes right now mark in origan
[3:42:53.520 --> 3:42:59.760]  you're on the air with alan watt go ahead sorry about that it's okay cover for me and i was
[3:42:59.760 --> 3:43:05.440]  alex well thank you thank you very much uh great to speak with you and alan uh alan i really i
[3:43:05.440 --> 3:43:10.240]  have uh i'd like to get your opinion on something i have an idea that i feel could be very effective
[3:43:10.240 --> 3:43:16.800]  in this uh the struggle of humanity against the coming tyranny here and as the tyranny currently
[3:43:16.800 --> 3:43:22.160]  exists you know i like alex i really respect your your intelligence and your heart out that's why
[3:43:22.160 --> 3:43:27.680]  i'm asking you this it'll take me about uh one minute to go over it go over it and uh turn the
[3:43:27.680 --> 3:43:32.880]  radio off to finish yeah do me a big favor turn the radio off my radio is off okay well i'm getting
[3:43:32.880 --> 3:43:42.000]  that code but go ahead okay uh alan the only and by far the most powerful weapon which is readily
[3:43:42.000 --> 3:43:48.960]  available uh as we speak to deal in a very to deal a very substantial blow to the enemy's progress
[3:43:48.960 --> 3:43:56.560]  here and in its implementation of world tyranny is a weapon of publicity and the logical vehicle
[3:43:56.560 --> 3:44:02.240]  as well as the only vehicle available to spread on a global basis not only the urgency of the very
[3:44:02.240 --> 3:44:09.600]  short time that the world's people have until they will all be under total and complete tyranny
[3:44:09.600 --> 3:44:16.960]  but also to achieve the ultimate projection of the facts of truth of the info war is the combination
[3:44:16.960 --> 3:44:26.400]  of alex's celebrity of fusing as such of the world celebrity of alex jones into a globally
[3:44:26.400 --> 3:44:32.160]  effective vehicle of publicity all right let me just stop you for a minute i am not that big okay
[3:44:32.160 --> 3:44:36.480]  i don't want to be some big giant leader that's very dangerous the reason we have power on the
[3:44:36.480 --> 3:44:41.680]  show is we have great activist listeners who are great leaders in their own right uh people are
[3:44:41.680 --> 3:44:45.120]  always thinking i can do this magic bullet that magic bullet i can barely get the trash taken out
[3:44:45.120 --> 3:44:50.240]  around here so uh but finish up your points i want to get everybody else that you as you said
[3:44:50.240 --> 3:44:56.320]  you know you are the globally recognized leader of this freedom movement and i only see one available
[3:44:56.320 --> 3:45:03.280]  and viable vehicle and that is a movie it'd be about the 14 years of your radio life alex
[3:45:03.280 --> 3:45:08.320]  it could be made with the assistance of the many and varied producers directors and actors
[3:45:08.880 --> 3:45:14.880]  whom you know personally and who admire you and it would i believe assist in the they would
[3:45:15.600 --> 3:45:21.200]  assist in the production the financing and the acting parts with you playing yourself not when
[3:45:21.200 --> 3:45:25.120]  people threaten to kill their children we've already tried to put out another film and they
[3:45:25.120 --> 3:45:28.720]  threaten to kill people's children so they pulled out but listen i appreciate your call
[3:45:28.720 --> 3:45:35.680]  all they can defeat anything that is based on one move okay but we have to be like a hundred
[3:45:35.680 --> 3:45:40.240]  headed hydra but not just that you know a hundred hundred headed hydras and that's why i bring alan
[3:45:40.240 --> 3:45:44.320]  watt and others to try to build them up and you know and he's doing that in his own right so i
[3:45:45.040 --> 3:45:49.120]  i don't agree on this you know single move thing or trying to produce a film they just
[3:45:49.120 --> 3:45:54.720]  then wouldn't distribute it you want to explain that to people alan yes true as well um you
[3:45:54.720 --> 3:45:58.960]  don't understand as well that everyone out there has to fight for their own life basically and for
[3:45:58.960 --> 3:46:04.320]  their children and it's it's too easy to to one way or another legally or otherwise get rid of
[3:46:04.320 --> 3:46:10.000]  someone at the top and when you're gone uh the one who's leading you is over you're like the
[3:46:10.000 --> 3:46:14.320]  you're like bureaucrats without the political leader at the top it's the same thing so you've
[3:46:14.320 --> 3:46:19.360]  got to be your own champion and you have to do the legwork you have to go out and be vocal
[3:46:20.080 --> 3:46:24.160]  everyone's involved here everyone is involved we're going to stop looking for champions
[3:46:24.160 --> 3:46:28.160]  you are your own champion well that's one of the biggest forms of programming is the arnold
[3:46:28.160 --> 3:46:33.920]  sforzenegger the whoever the archetypal hercules archetype he goes out and slays the dragons
[3:46:33.920 --> 3:46:38.080]  for you and then people constantly think no no no the reason we're successful here is we're
[3:46:38.080 --> 3:46:43.600]  getting the people to go out and mobilize and then it's a thousand heads they have no way of
[3:46:43.600 --> 3:46:50.320]  stopping us that way if it's an idea i'm not bulletproof alan watt's not bulletproof but ideas
[3:46:50.320 --> 3:46:59.280]  are bulletproof and that's correct and also um we realize as well that um anyone can be threatened
[3:46:59.280 --> 3:47:04.560]  or got to one way or another or blackmailed or your or your family threatened or something
[3:47:04.560 --> 3:47:09.360]  that's where you have one leader of a personality kelp that's why they've been in the movies
[3:47:09.360 --> 3:47:15.840]  so many movies have had for the 20 years the one the one is coming to help right the savior
[3:47:15.840 --> 3:47:20.960]  the army of one one person it's obama it's whoever they've got to save you it's always
[3:47:20.960 --> 3:47:25.920]  about making you feel inadequate that's what madison avenue is all about exactly and people
[3:47:25.920 --> 3:47:30.400]  have to realize no you are your own champion and your own family depends on what you do
[3:47:30.960 --> 3:47:37.040]  and everyone else around you as well uh so everyone is involved in this so there's no no one
[3:47:37.040 --> 3:47:42.960]  of us that who talk on radio can stop it all happening for you we can certainly try and
[3:47:42.960 --> 3:47:47.840]  impede it and get the word out but it's up to you to do your own parking yeah and i mean it's
[3:47:47.840 --> 3:47:52.080]  part of it sure they made a film about getting started you know having threatened by the military
[3:47:52.080 --> 3:47:56.640]  bohemian grove all the stuff we've been through you know all the things we've broken and covered
[3:47:56.640 --> 3:48:01.440]  that would be interesting that only be one part of the solution you know it it's again it's a
[3:48:01.440 --> 3:48:05.200]  movement of liberty and awakening but thank you mark i'm not i appreciate your support i'm not
[3:48:05.200 --> 3:48:10.240]  poo pooing your idea i'm just bringing you know more perspective to it steven chicago steve you're
[3:48:10.240 --> 3:48:17.760]  on the air alex uh i hate to say this but i think alan wanton the watson brothers are an mi6 spainas
[3:48:17.760 --> 3:48:24.160]  and they poison your mind subliminally and subconsciously with anglican culture oh let me
[3:48:24.160 --> 3:48:30.560]  let me explain something sir that's funny um alan watt and the watson brothers are not related
[3:48:31.200 --> 3:48:37.680]  uh paul watson was running a tiny website and had never been contacted by me and i called up and
[3:48:37.680 --> 3:48:43.280]  said would you like to do webmaster work for me and i'm gonna start a website called prisonplanet.com
[3:48:43.280 --> 3:48:48.000]  so let's get one thing straight uh it works like this i call paul watson up and tell him what i want
[3:48:48.000 --> 3:48:53.120]  done we're friends but that's it i talked to paul about twice a week okay there's one person running
[3:48:53.120 --> 3:48:58.400]  things in this office it's me me there's no handlers there's none of that and the same thing with alan
[3:48:58.400 --> 3:49:03.280]  watt i mean why because they got british accents they must be bad i mean what are you talking about
[3:49:03.280 --> 3:49:08.720]  well that's that's the point you know uh the situation is this all this anglican culture
[3:49:08.720 --> 3:49:14.720]  we got roger kippling and the white man's burden which much must be observed undramatic we have the
[3:49:15.760 --> 3:49:22.000]  sir thomas more utopianism undramatic must be observed uh we have the angry young men social
[3:49:22.000 --> 3:49:27.760]  injustices to minorities during the 1950s must be observed sir i gotta let you go this is too
[3:49:27.760 --> 3:49:34.640]  insane i mean alan watt exposes uh roger kippling uh as pushing the anglo-american establishment
[3:49:34.640 --> 3:49:39.520]  alan you know it's just crazy we're trying to mobilize people to a national draft that
[3:49:39.520 --> 3:49:43.760]  passed the house friday and they don't want to discuss that it's all about us you see how
[3:49:43.760 --> 3:49:48.080]  they're obsessed with us because we're the supposed leaders that's right there are people
[3:49:48.080 --> 3:49:52.160]  who are in their little tunnels and you'll never change their minds on anything they're stuck
[3:49:52.160 --> 3:49:55.920]  here they like they like where they are and they've decided that's all they need to know
[3:49:55.920 --> 3:50:00.880]  and that they're back to their their close to anything further yeah i mean what does it matter
[3:50:00.880 --> 3:50:05.280]  if i talk to a member of the japanese diet exposing 9-11 as an inside job or if i interview the
[3:50:05.280 --> 3:50:10.000]  former german defense minister i interview alan watt i mean most americans don't even have passports
[3:50:10.000 --> 3:50:15.200]  and don't travel anywhere uh you know i mean it's it's now i'm evil because you got a british accent
[3:50:15.200 --> 3:50:20.560]  alan when all you do is expose the british empire this is the height of just one dimensional
[3:50:20.560 --> 3:50:26.000]  thinking see obama must be good because he's black see but you must be bad because you got a
[3:50:26.000 --> 3:50:32.240]  british accent that's right that's right and and uh some people too still think i am the alan watt
[3:50:32.240 --> 3:50:37.840]  that was uh lecturing back in the 20s and 30s i have to be about 90 if i was him well that's how
[3:50:37.840 --> 3:50:42.320]  this thing that i'm some catholic assassin i'm not even catholic started because there was a black
[3:50:42.320 --> 3:50:47.760]  guy named alex jones and people said why are you writing this alex this pro and i said that's not
[3:50:47.760 --> 3:50:52.240]  me and i didn't respond to him so they said that said he's he's the guy and it never ended and it's
[3:50:52.240 --> 3:50:56.400]  this huge cottage industry and and they just all believe it and i've seen that that you're some
[3:50:56.400 --> 3:51:03.200]  guy named alan watt who died 50 years ago yeah we'll be right back worried about the side effects

[3:57:19.440 --> 3:57:24.000]  system of i've noticed they've also programmed people where they can it's like crime stop they
[3:57:24.000 --> 3:57:29.200]  can never focus on the issue or documents of fema camps are real things they always go into
[3:57:29.200 --> 3:57:36.160]  weird conspiratorial subterfuge and then somehow bring us into it because they don't want to
[3:57:36.160 --> 3:57:40.480]  psychologically face the fact that they do have power and that they are the solution and that
[3:57:40.480 --> 3:57:45.200]  they have to go out and stop the new world order uh... so they then automatically have to say we're
[3:57:45.200 --> 3:57:53.360]  bad yes it's a tremendous psychology involved in all of this and uh... the whole world is run under
[3:57:53.360 --> 3:57:58.880]  psychology and the guys that make all the dramas on television have their instructions from top
[3:57:58.880 --> 3:58:04.080]  psychologists uh... and even altered for different ethnic people in different countries the same

[4:00:50.960 --> 4:00:57.200]  now going back to alan watt finishing up the point you were making about and you know we see
[4:00:57.200 --> 4:01:00.480]  people when they're told they have cancer they get mad at the doctor or you know we bring them
[4:01:00.480 --> 4:01:04.480]  this message and then somehow about half the time of people fighting the new world order and if we
[4:01:04.480 --> 4:01:09.360]  could stop this we would actually you know win and and and be able to defeat the globalist we're
[4:01:09.360 --> 4:01:14.320]  already very close its obsessions on those of us that are standing up and speaking out
[4:01:14.320 --> 4:01:20.800]  and i see great people like enough respect who's had probably forty fifty million i mean he's got
[4:01:20.800 --> 4:01:25.840]  videos with ten million views apiece and a couple years ago you know all his videos would get two
[4:01:25.840 --> 4:01:30.160]  three four million views suddenly they started restricting his views and now his videos will say
[4:01:30.160 --> 4:01:35.360]  five million views or from five million to five thousand yeah and he's getting mad i've had to
[4:01:35.360 --> 4:01:40.480]  beg him not to quit because his videos get put on hundreds of other video servers it's still being
[4:01:40.480 --> 4:01:45.920]  seen by as many people and he's saying again on his website on his youtube page he's going to quit
[4:01:46.480 --> 4:01:52.000]  you they're they're they're blocking him because he's effective and so a lot of people that stick
[4:01:52.000 --> 4:01:57.040]  their head up to fight the new world order get attacked by the pre-programmed massive people
[4:01:57.040 --> 4:02:00.640]  not just those that openly disagree with us and want the new world order say it doesn't exist
[4:02:00.640 --> 4:02:05.200]  but by the bottom feeders and the government operatives and their and their can't followers
[4:02:05.200 --> 4:02:09.840]  that then attack anyone that sticks their head up kind of the crab syndrome or crabs in a bucket
[4:02:09.840 --> 4:02:13.440]  if you've ever been fishing for crabs we'll try to stop any other crab from crawling out instead
[4:02:13.440 --> 4:02:18.720]  of working together can you I see that as the biggest thing to break just by ignoring it and
[4:02:18.720 --> 4:02:22.320]  moving forward with solutions to defeat the new world order your comments on that and we're going
[4:02:22.320 --> 4:02:28.960]  to go to calls yes well I was reading a book quite a few years ago on how this was unfolded
[4:02:28.960 --> 4:02:33.680]  in society and they said they would actually encourage those and in what they called the fringe
[4:02:33.680 --> 4:02:40.640]  group by that they meant those who are borderline there's a lot of borderline psychotics and they
[4:02:40.640 --> 4:02:44.640]  would encourage that group in fact they might even especially in the internet they can come into
[4:02:44.640 --> 4:02:51.120]  that precise and uh encourage the psychotic ones to attack personalities who are being effective
[4:02:51.120 --> 4:02:57.200]  so so that is actually underway right now in a big scale um I know that for a fact many people
[4:02:57.200 --> 4:03:01.920]  who went to the forums will tell you they'll start off fine and someone comes in they'll all
[4:03:01.920 --> 4:03:05.920]  like this person's got lots of information next thing you know he's got them all fighting each
[4:03:05.920 --> 4:03:12.880]  other or going off in a different tangent uh and or attacking someone who is effective the idea being
[4:03:12.880 --> 4:03:19.520]  that if you if you get up there and have a voice and then you're really altering the outlook of
[4:03:19.520 --> 4:03:23.920]  many people then you must be one of them that's the that's the first thing they jump at they don't
[4:03:23.920 --> 4:03:29.760]  think you can be genuine at all it is true that in the past uh agencies have put their own people
[4:03:29.760 --> 4:03:35.200]  in place we know that with certain people who did the patriot rounds in fact years ago uh and is
[4:03:35.200 --> 4:03:42.400]  admitted afterwards they were government operatives by themselves um so yeah you can't trust everyone
[4:03:42.400 --> 4:03:47.920]  but you don't attack everyone either who's getting the word out and we're not advising you as to what
[4:03:47.920 --> 4:03:54.800]  to do except to protest you can protest that's the only right we have left at the moment uh is
[4:03:54.800 --> 4:04:01.200]  to protest um what's happening in the world we know what the next step would be the other boys know
[4:04:01.200 --> 4:04:07.600]  it too so all we can do is protest and say no and do the gandy thing and go along with that and just
[4:04:07.600 --> 4:04:17.120]  hope uh that that's enough well absolutely alan um getting an echo there guys we also see uh these
[4:04:17.120 --> 4:04:24.560]  formulas where what happens is somebody will come on the scene char radio show or website
[4:04:24.560 --> 4:04:30.160]  for about a year and they'll act normal and they'll get credibility yeah and and then suddenly they
[4:04:30.160 --> 4:04:34.880]  attack everybody and and create infighting and lies yes and then it's even come out in cases
[4:04:34.880 --> 4:04:39.680]  that they indeed were on government payroll that's right and fact i mean that the obvious one that
[4:04:39.680 --> 4:04:44.880]  comes to mind and this was this is public knowledge because he was on television right after now 11
[4:04:44.880 --> 4:04:51.920]  was was colonel bogh rights he uh studies on the shortwave patriot station he was collecting the
[4:04:51.920 --> 4:04:57.520]  names of people he said on the air many times he left a pentagon with hip pocket orders and after
[4:04:57.520 --> 4:05:02.880]  9 11 he came out he was on the congressional steps it was on television he said i think it's
[4:05:02.880 --> 4:05:09.280]  those crazy paranoid shortwave patriot types who did this that's what he said he said well black
[4:05:09.280 --> 4:05:15.600]  helicopters he said black helicopters there were bombings going on and i said it was uh uh because
[4:05:15.600 --> 4:05:19.760]  it was a smiley face they were bombing i said that looks like fight club but it didn't matter and
[4:05:19.760 --> 4:05:26.480]  then i got mad at him and then i wasn't the patriot because i said oh my gosh uh this guy is is now
[4:05:26.480 --> 4:05:30.080]  demonizing everybody he claimed to work with and he never mentioned on television he just
[4:05:30.080 --> 4:05:36.080]  been about four years on patriot broadcasting i mean it's always so obvious and he blamed the
[4:05:36.080 --> 4:05:42.880]  patriot broadcasters for being behind this yeah that's just incredible and very sad because uh
[4:05:45.200 --> 4:05:49.360]  but that's what they mean for us to do is just constantly be paranoid folks you know you're
[4:05:49.360 --> 4:05:54.400]  good you know you're not new world order out there watching okay say i'm bad say whoever but doesn't
[4:05:54.400 --> 4:06:00.240]  matter at least you know you're good go out and fight wake people up get involved because the
[4:06:00.240 --> 4:06:04.320]  globalist aren't his power they don't have that many agents they're trying to create them right now
[4:06:04.320 --> 4:06:07.760]  but you'll know an agent i mean i've run into hundreds of them they say let's carry out terror
[4:06:07.760 --> 4:06:12.560]  attacks let's attack police alex and you follow them to their unmarked police car i mean it's it's
[4:06:12.560 --> 4:06:17.360]  very obvious to notice these people feds don't get on air and say you have power you can affect
[4:06:17.360 --> 4:06:22.000]  change bill of rights constitution we can wake up the police and military we can defeat the globalist
[4:06:22.000 --> 4:06:27.120]  program they don't get up and explain to you how psychological warfare operates what they do is
[4:06:27.120 --> 4:06:33.040]  they come in and they attack other patriots that's always what they do and they are intensifying
[4:06:33.040 --> 4:06:37.680]  their operations right now because we're i mean we have government documents that the army is
[4:06:37.680 --> 4:06:44.640]  watching and tracking myself and others okay i mean yeah i've got data as well data that comes
[4:06:44.640 --> 4:06:51.120]  through many different sources and it's the same across britain canada the u.s. where they are
[4:06:51.120 --> 4:06:59.280]  monitoring openly and attacking cyber attacks on people who are a talk show host now you're talking
[4:06:59.280 --> 4:07:07.360]  about the ratings and how they fiddle with the ratings and i use one server and i know often
[4:07:07.360 --> 4:07:13.680]  all my different sites onto his server so it's all drawn off his and people will email me the next
[4:07:13.680 --> 4:07:19.920]  day after my own shows and they'll congratulate me or something or add information to it but that
[4:07:19.920 --> 4:07:27.040]  server has a reading of zero zero people coming in to see it which is nonsense that's what they do
[4:07:27.040 --> 4:07:33.280]  they can fiddle the statistics with everything and and just make you disappear if need be yeah well
[4:07:33.280 --> 4:07:38.720]  now i didn't get to it earlier but we actually have the video clip of it's up on info wars dot
[4:07:38.720 --> 4:07:46.320]  com of john rockefeller up there in uh west virginia and he's openly coming out and saying
[4:07:46.320 --> 4:07:50.000]  they want to shut the web down i mean this is all over the news now we kept warning people
[4:07:50.720 --> 4:07:57.280]  yes and i've read articles before from mainstream media where they've shown you the photographs
[4:07:57.280 --> 4:08:03.840]  of these cyber teams for the military who have been given to go ahead to attack using cyber techniques
[4:08:03.840 --> 4:08:08.320]  anybody who's giving them a problem and i've had them i've had three computers crash at the same
[4:08:08.320 --> 4:08:14.080]  time uh when they come into your computers they can do it so easily today and you have no it's
[4:08:14.080 --> 4:08:19.200]  no way to fight back with them you can buy all the security programs you want everything remember
[4:08:19.200 --> 4:08:27.680]  95 1995 the u.s and canada signed an agreement that every device for communication from fax telephone
[4:08:27.680 --> 4:08:33.520]  to computer must be must have back doors built in for government agencies to get in and access
[4:08:33.520 --> 4:08:37.680]  whenever they wish that was exactly what i was about to say and that's now they admit
[4:08:37.680 --> 4:08:42.160]  under federal law 96 i reported this five years before it was mainstream news i read the telecommunications
[4:08:42.160 --> 4:08:47.840]  act that they actually even when they're turned off track you listen to you uh that uh you know
[4:08:47.840 --> 4:08:53.840]  all these systems are doing it again we have an illegitimate criminal government that follows a
[4:08:53.840 --> 4:08:58.560]  mindset of eugenics that's their excuse for all the ruthless wicked things they do they believe
[4:08:58.560 --> 4:09:05.760]  they're god they believe they're creating uh the new man and it's just amazing uh what they're doing
[4:09:05.760 --> 4:09:12.880]  now i um want to go to some phone calls here in closing with you alan but is there anything else
[4:09:12.880 --> 4:09:20.960]  that you want to add yes the say um we're dealing with uh as you say pretty well a criminal criminal
[4:09:20.960 --> 4:09:26.960]  gangster brotherhood at the top that has had its own way for so long behind the scenes that
[4:09:26.960 --> 4:09:32.000]  put everything done they wish to accomplish at that time they're coming out to the open now
[4:09:32.000 --> 4:09:39.120]  they want us to respect them as a criminal gangster team and to obey them and uh we don't have long
[4:09:39.120 --> 4:09:43.360]  to go now it doesn't take long once tyranny is underway and you're used to seeing neighbors
[4:09:43.360 --> 4:09:48.880]  dragged off in the middle of the night before you accept that there's been you normal and
[4:09:48.880 --> 4:09:54.480]  then you're too ashamed to participate or stand up for anyone you got to do it now because they're
[4:09:54.480 --> 4:10:00.080]  on a roll uh they're deadly serious and i mean that these guys are killers at the top they look
[4:10:00.080 --> 4:10:06.720]  upon society they're just blank faces they don't see people they see a mass of blank faces uh
[4:10:06.720 --> 4:10:11.680]  they're just superfluous at this moment and they want to bring the population down they've
[4:10:11.680 --> 4:10:16.800]  published all their findings over and over and over and what they do is they don't put any of this
[4:10:16.800 --> 4:10:22.160]  through any kind of congress they simply make it happen through exactly it and for all those
[4:10:22.160 --> 4:10:26.880]  for all those that are attacking us alan and for those that aren't government operatives that
[4:10:26.880 --> 4:10:33.040]  pick up on it attack you yourself and others understand folks that's the mark that we're
[4:10:33.040 --> 4:10:40.800]  affecting change that we're for real that the the evidence is proven by our fruits by their
[4:10:40.800 --> 4:10:45.120]  fruits you will know them you need to ask those people that are attacking us or tell those they're
[4:10:45.120 --> 4:10:50.640]  brainwashing why do these people only spend their time attacking other patriots because
[4:10:50.640 --> 4:10:56.560]  they are feds or federally handled and again it doesn't bother me when this happens because i
[4:10:56.560 --> 4:11:01.440]  know that means i'm effective but i i hate seeing well-meaning people not get involved in the fight
[4:11:01.440 --> 4:11:06.320]  full bore because they're so busy chasing their tail in these little systems it's not going to save
[4:11:06.960 --> 4:11:11.840]  the country and the world uh if we all just police each other and boss each other around
[4:11:11.840 --> 4:11:16.640]  and nitpick at each other that's the mark of coantel pro or mentally ill people what we've
[4:11:16.640 --> 4:11:22.160]  got to do is get the people to say no to the new world order no to gun confiscation no to national
[4:11:22.160 --> 4:11:26.720]  draft that this is tearing up the bankers in the private federal reserve need to be brought to justice
[4:11:26.720 --> 4:11:32.640]  need to be arrested i'm risking my life talking like that folks this is dangerous we're focused on
[4:11:32.640 --> 4:11:38.400]  the new world order that's the key alan we are and that it's sure enough it is dangerous because
[4:11:38.400 --> 4:11:44.720]  we're trying to motivate people to stand up for themselves before it's too late and really when
[4:11:44.720 --> 4:11:50.000]  the people with their colors are talking what we can do about it one thing that has to be done
[4:11:50.000 --> 4:11:54.320]  is that every agency that is private like the comes from foreign relations at the top and
[4:11:54.320 --> 4:11:59.520]  trilaterals and so on have to be completely disbanded and have nothing to do with government
[4:11:59.520 --> 4:12:05.360]  input whatsoever because they're unelected by any people they're private organizations funded by
[4:12:05.360 --> 4:12:12.000]  the bankers directly and we've got to get rid of that so these organizations that have the ear
[4:12:12.000 --> 4:12:18.080]  they have to think tanks that advise the military this is this is a super a supra government over
[4:12:18.080 --> 4:12:25.520]  and above the elected government it's got to be literally made illegal to operate all right let's
[4:12:25.520 --> 4:12:30.080]  go to calls in the time we have left abby in new york first caller thanks for holding her on the
[4:12:30.080 --> 4:12:36.880]  air with alan watt yes hi this is abby in new york thank you so much um i just recently watched
[4:12:36.880 --> 4:12:42.560]  obama's reception an end game and i finally feel like i have an answer to everything i have been
[4:12:42.560 --> 4:12:49.680]  and uh feeling that just was not right uh in our nation it's because instead of seeing all the
[4:12:49.680 --> 4:12:54.880]  false paradigm and and the distractions and the false template they load into your brain now you're
[4:12:54.880 --> 4:13:00.880]  at the elite perspective from their own documents of how they say they're running the world go ahead
[4:13:02.240 --> 4:13:07.520]  yes um you know i mean we're meant to be co-dependent to our government almost in a constant state of
[4:13:07.520 --> 4:13:12.480]  reaction to what's going on but not to have free thinking and i realized you know i went to public
[4:13:12.480 --> 4:13:16.640]  school um it starts in public school you know don't question what you're learning don't question
[4:13:16.640 --> 4:13:22.640]  where it comes from uh just repeat it you know off the college um i went to a major university
[4:13:22.640 --> 4:13:27.920]  in pennsylvania same thing there and then you know you're given you know you know the choice to join
[4:13:27.920 --> 4:13:32.800]  corporate america or else you could consider a failure at that point and um you know i've been
[4:13:32.800 --> 4:13:38.320]  living out here in new york there is a youth movement um for uh going against the world order
[4:13:38.320 --> 4:13:44.560]  there is a developing awareness um i'm looking forward to uh being a part of that uh in my own
[4:13:44.560 --> 4:13:50.240]  layout here uh one thing i wanted to bring up that concerned me about uh modern eugenics experiments
[4:13:50.240 --> 4:13:58.320]  taking place with the university i attended there was a cna uh project um mapping project to see how
[4:13:58.320 --> 4:14:05.280]  we were all related um as far as our racing genes went and this was being uh as part of the genome
[4:14:05.280 --> 4:14:11.280]  project um i participated and now they have you know my dna everyone else's cna thing is what it's
[4:14:11.280 --> 4:14:17.280]  being used for oh yeah that whole national geographic thing ties back to colesprings harbour
[4:14:17.280 --> 4:14:24.880]  colesprings harbour in new york uh why don't you explain to them alan ibn colesprings harbour
[4:14:24.880 --> 4:14:30.560]  national geographic we're going to remember yeah colespring harbour was set up by the american
[4:14:30.560 --> 4:14:37.200]  eugenics society funded by the rockefeller foundation and karen eggy foundation they brought
[4:14:37.200 --> 4:14:44.160]  in the census to to literally to start to track the offspring of people keep uh their medical
[4:14:44.160 --> 4:14:49.440]  psychological records any mental illness in the family any prison records and so on to see if the
[4:14:49.440 --> 4:14:54.160]  genes were sort of as and they would keep popping up down through the generations that were already
[4:14:54.160 --> 4:14:59.920]  categorizing different people done through the generations from the early from the late 1800s
[4:14:59.920 --> 4:15:04.880]  right through to the present time that was a sole purpose of it initially was to track the
[4:15:04.880 --> 4:15:09.280]  genes of the people to see who would have to be eliminated and who would not because they claim
[4:15:09.280 --> 4:15:15.840]  that if you have a murderer in your family line uh 10 generations ago it's liable to pop up again
[4:15:15.840 --> 4:15:20.080]  so you you you just can't take the chance with you you have to be eliminated eventually are
[4:15:20.080 --> 4:15:25.280]  sterilized that's still the policy that they have at the top today so you're quite correct yeah
[4:15:26.160 --> 4:15:29.760]  all right thank you so much uh good to hear from you abby god bless you
[4:15:29.760 --> 4:15:36.960]  brent in new orleans you're on the air welcome hey uh how's it going alex um i just wanted to
[4:15:36.960 --> 4:15:42.240]  get out one little point um in mainstream media right now they're talking about timothy geithner
[4:15:42.240 --> 4:15:50.240]  being the you know quote unquote architect of the bush bailout right alan is that correct
[4:15:50.240 --> 4:15:55.440]  about that well some of them have said that i don't really uh accept that as much higher powers
[4:15:55.440 --> 4:15:59.440]  that they will never even hear their names at the top to bonus yeah yeah in fact they were
[4:15:59.440 --> 4:16:03.840]  talking to me just for a second when you were talking at i hear behind scenes what exactly was
[4:16:03.840 --> 4:16:09.120]  your question they're talking about timothy geithner being the architect of the bush bailout
[4:16:09.120 --> 4:16:14.880]  oh no oh no yeah no no no no no i said when they first put him in they blame it on paul sin
[4:16:14.880 --> 4:16:19.200]  but meanwhile it turns out geithner helped write part of it but he's a high level functionary
[4:16:19.760 --> 4:16:25.280]  his father you know headed up a major foundation that obama's mother worked for him as his adjunct
[4:16:26.000 --> 4:16:32.080]  as his second uh and so they've been childhood friends uh geithner comes from an elite family
[4:16:32.080 --> 4:16:36.800]  so he is high level but at a minion level but see when they're done they'll make him resign in a
[4:16:36.800 --> 4:16:42.400]  year or two maybe even sooner and then all the blame goes on him and then the new blame goes on the
[4:16:42.400 --> 4:16:47.600]  new puppet so this is a microcosm of how they blame everything on bush then bring obama and let
[4:16:47.600 --> 4:16:53.120]  it they'll blame everything on obama bringing the next savior this is all part of the very simplistic
[4:16:53.120 --> 4:16:58.560]  bait switch only one of hundreds of different psychological warfare tricks they play wrapped
[4:16:58.560 --> 4:17:02.160]  together alan want you want to comment on that yes and all these people who take the blame
[4:17:02.160 --> 4:17:08.640]  end up with golden parachutes remember richard nixon left supposedly the white house in disgrace
[4:17:08.640 --> 4:17:15.280]  we didn't know that he was given one of the most important jobs ever after that until he died and
[4:17:15.280 --> 4:17:21.280]  that was to help set up the free trade system with china help all the money flow to china to
[4:17:21.280 --> 4:17:25.920]  build up to be the manufacturer of the world we didn't know that that was kept totally secret
[4:17:25.920 --> 4:17:33.520]  until he died then he was given a military funeral for his role in setting up the new world order
[4:17:33.520 --> 4:17:39.680]  they never ever fade off and are admonished they're always given a golden parachute and a handshake
[4:17:39.680 --> 4:17:43.760]  and they probably knew a long time before that look you're going to take the rap for something
[4:17:43.760 --> 4:17:48.400]  but really we're promoting you to a higher level exactly one year after on average they then
[4:17:48.400 --> 4:17:54.320]  rehabilitate they're already starting to rehabilitate bush okay and then oh obama says bush was right
[4:17:54.320 --> 4:17:58.800]  and then obama will be the fall guy then they'll rehabilitate him and he'll get look at tony blair
[4:17:58.800 --> 4:18:03.760]  you know he's the head un envoy for the middle east they're talking about him being in the
[4:18:03.760 --> 4:18:08.640]  future the head of the european union that's right and so they never ever they know this they know
[4:18:08.640 --> 4:18:12.720]  that's part of the game and they take they take the rap publicly i mean while they have their
[4:18:12.720 --> 4:18:17.360]  drinks behind the door at the closed doors and congratulate each other and then they're given
[4:18:17.360 --> 4:18:22.800]  directorships on lots and lots of board for the payoffs sure that's how it happens in fact you
[4:18:22.800 --> 4:18:27.280]  don't get into the real power elite until after you've been a prime minister or a president or
[4:18:27.280 --> 4:18:32.960]  a national security advisor and then you enter the super college of real technocrats who then
[4:18:32.960 --> 4:18:38.560]  meet weekly around the world to fine tune their sub directorates and that's what the cfr wrote last
[4:18:38.560 --> 4:18:42.480]  week with james jones the head of the national security council that we cover in the obama
[4:18:42.480 --> 4:18:47.760]  deception where he says look he's there's being us where do i follow my orders what do i formulate
[4:18:47.760 --> 4:18:53.040]  i follow the orders of dr henry kissinger yes and my great thatcher has said in 1990
[4:18:53.920 --> 4:18:59.600]  at maxi hall in toronto her series of lectures across the world was called it the new world order
[4:19:00.320 --> 4:19:07.920]  and the coming war on fundamentalist religion uh she said that um i now belong to the parallel
[4:19:07.920 --> 4:19:12.640]  government she said all ex-prime ministers and presidents and top-level bureaucrats who all
[4:19:12.640 --> 4:19:16.960]  know each other we can get the job done we're not answerable to the public she called it the
[4:19:16.960 --> 4:19:22.400]  real government and they say it on record because margaret thatchill write a book that's only for
[4:19:22.400 --> 4:19:27.600]  technocrats maybe 20 000 copy sells you know uh helmet schmidt german chancellor writes men in
[4:19:27.600 --> 4:19:32.400]  power says world government runs everything builder group eugenics i love doing uh druidic
[4:19:32.400 --> 4:19:37.520]  rituals in northern california we do rituals in germany but my in fact it's in there on the shelf
[4:19:37.520 --> 4:19:41.760]  at the end of the long haul i pulled it out last week nobody put it back it's on the shelf on the
[4:19:41.760 --> 4:19:45.920]  end of that haul men in power is a political retrospective will somebody bring that in
[4:19:45.920 --> 4:19:51.040]  because then they brag in the books of the idiots don't read books yeah you know and i mean those
[4:19:51.040 --> 4:19:57.760]  that do they read harry potter or hardy boy and nancy drew or something well they read some stupid
[4:19:57.760 --> 4:20:04.080]  obama book so it's it's a big joke it's like a wroth cop the former head of the kissinger group
[4:20:04.080 --> 4:20:07.600]  i we call him up because y'all want to go on and counter mr jones and he admits y'all were
[4:20:07.600 --> 4:20:12.080]  setting up a world government but it's for your own good and his book super class he writes an
[4:20:12.080 --> 4:20:18.240]  article for the washington post bragging world government is good for you yeah that's it it's
[4:20:18.240 --> 4:20:22.480]  in the open for those that want to go and we did too but it's never mentioned on mainstream media
[4:20:23.280 --> 4:20:26.720]  yeah listen i don't want to be used much more of our guest time but let's hurry through a few

[4:21:42.480 --> 4:21:46.480]  some street action flyers for folks we just don't have the money to buy a bunch of billboards but
[4:21:46.480 --> 4:21:51.680]  if individuals are good we got a money bomb well that's another issue i can't have one of those
[4:21:51.680 --> 4:21:56.400]  we haven't worked out the technology for that probably never will but uh we are trying as
[4:21:56.400 --> 4:22:03.040]  best we can sir believe me i just i need people to buy the dvds at info wars dot com so i can hire
[4:22:03.040 --> 4:22:06.960]  more people so we can do more but then i'm too busy giving them out for free to ever do that i

[4:22:58.720 --> 4:23:03.040]  coded system in which we live for literally the language itself is used as a technique for
[4:23:03.040 --> 4:23:07.920]  controlling us it's it looks like a linguistics really yeah that's what orwell talked about
[4:23:07.920 --> 4:23:12.640]  because he'd been a member of the secret police in india then he'd been in wars for the communist
[4:23:12.640 --> 4:23:17.360]  in in spain then he'd lived homeless just to see what it was like down in paris in france
[4:23:17.360 --> 4:23:22.480]  to kill an elephant and all his little essays and read them all and uh then he went to the bbc
[4:23:22.480 --> 4:23:27.840]  and he found out my god it's a global government a secret society of eugenicist playing everybody
[4:23:27.840 --> 4:23:32.720]  off against each other for the sadistic pleasure of stomping on the human soul forever and he wrote
[4:23:32.720 --> 4:23:37.200]  that book and a lot of evidence shows they killed him alan watt comments on that that is right he
[4:23:37.200 --> 4:23:43.280]  did that actually he could went off to live in a very remote islands in scotland that has lots of
[4:23:43.280 --> 4:23:48.720]  adders all around the address snake very poisonous uh to be ever close because he thought they were
[4:23:48.720 --> 4:23:53.440]  going to send men after him to kill him and he'd always check the incoming boat once a month to
[4:23:53.440 --> 4:23:59.920]  see who was honored to see if it was a possible uh assassin on board he knew because you see he was
[4:23:59.920 --> 4:24:06.720]  he was raised uh to to work for them uh to help um bring in this world system and many of the people
[4:24:06.720 --> 4:24:10.880]  in those days truly thought it was going to be better than having perpetual wars that's how it
[4:24:10.880 --> 4:24:16.320]  was fed to them until he realized that there was another group at the top running all this and all
[4:24:16.320 --> 4:24:23.120]  sides that's right he was a top socialist his family was actually mid-level british aristocracy
[4:24:23.120 --> 4:24:29.200]  at the uh technocrat level and he was married in uh to the darwins and the galtons and all of them
[4:24:29.920 --> 4:24:36.400]  and his mother was a bonapartist they called him and he even fed idealism from birth and until he
[4:24:36.400 --> 4:24:42.560]  realized by that the war in spain when he was participating in it there he realized there was
[4:24:42.560 --> 4:24:49.040]  another party running all sides of every impact and he saw the long-term arrangements and he
[4:24:49.040 --> 4:24:53.920]  spoke out against it then the socialists turned their back on them and that's right he found out
[4:24:53.920 --> 4:25:00.480]  that british intelligence was manipulating the killer commies to throw out the idealistic commies
[4:25:00.480 --> 4:25:06.000]  and they would use them but but then again he was a top propagandist at bbc and and that's
[4:25:06.000 --> 4:25:11.920]  he's talking about himself eric blair george arwell pen name when he talks about winston smith
[4:25:11.920 --> 4:25:16.480]  that's right and he admitted that that's where you learned it in the department of propaganda
[4:25:17.040 --> 4:25:22.080]  and war war war two britain bbc because he worked in that that department to convince
[4:25:22.080 --> 4:25:26.960]  british housewives that the cheap junk food that they were left with because of the war
[4:25:26.960 --> 4:25:32.160]  all the fatty stuff and so on was actually better and nutrition for them and it's once again we're
[4:25:32.160 --> 4:25:37.920]  using the expert at the terminology convincing public that that's how they train the children
[4:25:37.920 --> 4:25:43.520]  to be spies on their parents youth brigade squads everything out that he figures out that he's
[4:25:43.520 --> 4:25:48.240]  walking down the street and a buzz bomb flies in from east asia blows up a building and he goes
[4:25:48.240 --> 4:25:52.720]  oh that's the government again and he realizes that's a global government all waging war on
[4:25:52.720 --> 4:25:58.240]  humanity all having fake wars with each other and again to another good to move in a comedy
[4:25:58.240 --> 4:26:04.160]  fashion for those that can't follow 1984 or so it is brazil brazil terry grolliam
[4:26:04.160 --> 4:26:09.280]  put it in a comedy and uh at one stage there's bombs going off everywhere in restaurants and
[4:26:09.280 --> 4:26:13.760]  so on and his mother goes on as a terrorist again he says mother have you ever actually seen a
[4:26:13.760 --> 4:26:18.960]  terrorism a terrorist no one's ever seen one and the department of information retrieval is this
[4:26:18.960 --> 4:26:24.880]  massive huge skyscraper the largest building on the planet because it's all run up by information
[4:26:24.880 --> 4:26:30.240]  on every individual person and then a bug falls off the ceiling and one of the printers
[4:26:30.240 --> 4:26:34.320]  and so they come and swat team the dad dragging him away and then they give the woman a bill
[4:26:34.320 --> 4:26:40.000]  that's right because the the typewriter went to to tussle into a bottle let's take a few final
[4:26:40.000 --> 4:26:46.880]  calls and let you go uh who have i gotten up to here call wise francis in vancouver canada
[4:26:46.880 --> 4:26:50.480]  another canadian up there in the great north you're on the air with the one the only alan what
[4:26:50.480 --> 4:26:58.800]  hi alex alan um uh you know a lot of people who are new to you uh we'll have a hard time believing
[4:26:58.800 --> 4:27:05.280]  that these banks or gangsters are seen to murder large numbers of us but if you read alexander
[4:27:05.280 --> 4:27:11.440]  shawtyton's last great book which is 200 years together it's about this alexander shawtyton
[4:27:12.160 --> 4:27:19.200]  yeah he he gapped all the jewish historical records in russia and he proved irrefutably
[4:27:19.200 --> 4:27:26.480]  that 95 percent of the bolsheviks were jewish and that they murdered 45 million russians
[4:27:26.480 --> 4:27:34.320]  ukrainians and armenians and this is all a plot and we see now these same forces these
[4:27:34.320 --> 4:27:40.960]  same people are gathering here in in the west and they're like like alex described so closely
[4:27:40.960 --> 4:27:46.880]  like uh church off and all these people with the descendants of those same bolshevik jews
[4:27:46.880 --> 4:27:53.120]  that want to murder us they want to enslave us they want to create artificial famines
[4:27:53.120 --> 4:27:57.280]  they want to murder us well let me let me expand on that shelter needs and you notice the media
[4:27:57.280 --> 4:28:02.480]  doesn't want to attack him because he's a Pulitzer prize one and everything else his book does get
[4:28:02.480 --> 4:28:06.240]  into that but then you have to understand that there was a purge by stalling against those people
[4:28:06.240 --> 4:28:11.920]  that's why trotsky ran over here and created the neocons today so when you find out that there's
[4:28:11.920 --> 4:28:17.200]  another layer like the zionists at the beginning funded hitler and then made the jews in germany
[4:28:17.200 --> 4:28:22.640]  and in poland pay million dollar fees to allow them to escape to israel they couldn't go to england
[4:28:22.640 --> 4:28:27.200]  couldn't go to new york so you find out then and i'm certainly it's terrible what went on there
[4:28:27.200 --> 4:28:33.040]  and when we're not denying that but there is a level above that with and people say oh you're
[4:28:33.040 --> 4:28:38.080]  just bashing germans no folks i'm saying there's a level above that and i appreciate your call
[4:28:38.080 --> 4:28:43.360]  sir that's a great question for elin what when i haven't heard him uh... asked uh...
[4:28:43.360 --> 4:28:46.560]  i know you don't think research is me and in the even deeper many cases so i know you'll
[4:28:46.560 --> 4:28:51.600]  concur with the facts we just stated but there is a level above that if you just intellectually
[4:28:51.600 --> 4:28:57.440]  you're honest uh... a level above that so so when we look at the roth child's allied with the
[4:28:57.440 --> 4:29:01.600]  british anglo-american establishment telling hitler to go ahead and invade countries then
[4:29:01.600 --> 4:29:07.360]  setting him up he lets the british evacuate at duncork they send in uh... the rike furor
[4:29:07.360 --> 4:29:11.760]  rudolf hess who parachutes in you know the king of england was a nazi they made him advocate he
[4:29:11.760 --> 4:29:17.360]  said why are you doing this we had a deal yeah so they betrayed them they betray the the the
[4:29:17.360 --> 4:29:22.640]  globalist uh... betray everyone and so yes any power group is under their control whether it's
[4:29:22.640 --> 4:29:28.160]  just always look at the germans for yet always look for a group uh... and it's a minority
[4:29:28.160 --> 4:29:33.680]  that is under some kind of persecution and and that's the ones that they'll agitate and stir and
[4:29:33.680 --> 4:29:37.920]  they will use them and they might use them for fifty or a hundred years until they've achieved
[4:29:37.920 --> 4:29:42.240]  their objective and then they'll annihilate them as well and there's no doubt about it
[4:29:43.120 --> 4:29:49.120]  even i think it's rabbi uh... steven uh... yakov who does a shortwave program
[4:29:49.760 --> 4:29:55.040]  at night he's a rabbi and he uh... he really goes out against the palestinians all the time he
[4:29:55.040 --> 4:30:01.680]  doesn't hold anything back and his disgust etcetera however he did admit on a couple of his shows
[4:30:01.680 --> 4:30:07.520]  that uh... that the jews that lived in russia and appealed settlement certainly fell for the whole
[4:30:07.520 --> 4:30:14.080]  idea of communism and helped to to uh... bring it into being now that's a fact and then went after
[4:30:14.080 --> 4:30:18.720]  the ukrainian christians look this is how you this is how much schmidt german chancellor
[4:30:19.360 --> 4:30:25.920]  and you just go to the index under b and it says bilderberg two two two and i'm also under b is
[4:30:25.920 --> 4:30:33.680]  bohemian grove two two five so let me go to two two two two two two this is written by the president
[4:30:33.680 --> 4:30:42.000]  of the chancellor of germany two two two two uh... two two two here it is and uh... he admits that
[4:30:42.000 --> 4:30:46.640]  there is a world government shadow world government run by the bilderberg group i have shots of this
[4:30:46.640 --> 4:30:52.240]  in my bohemian grove film says henry kissinger is a big new brzezinski uh... william kaufmann
[4:30:52.240 --> 4:30:59.920]  and it goes on to say uh... a f l c i o joe jimini uh... lane kirkland
[4:31:00.480 --> 4:31:04.480]  and it says uh... basically setting up world government bill deberg conferences the prince
[4:31:04.480 --> 4:31:08.800]  bernard the netherlands organize and ran yearly meetings of the london institute for strategic
[4:31:08.800 --> 4:31:13.680]  studies of the leadership of allister buckin some of the united states senators active
[4:31:13.680 --> 4:31:18.880]  foreign it goes on to talk about uh... how they're setting up a global government there
[4:31:18.880 --> 4:31:27.040]  there and uh... here is another one on two two five where he gets into bohemian grove a tiny area
[4:31:27.040 --> 4:31:32.320]  of the beautiful nature alone is worth it but you can read he says we do rituals uh... in germany
[4:31:32.320 --> 4:31:36.480]  but my favorite place we have our own groves in germany my favorite place in northern california
[4:31:36.480 --> 4:31:41.040]  and how they set globalist policy i mean i could just read all this on air but the point is
[4:31:41.040 --> 4:31:45.440]  there are hundreds of books written by these people and then the new york times just a few
[4:31:45.440 --> 4:31:51.200]  years ago saying bill deberg didn't exist alon yeah i know and uh... if it is out in the open
[4:31:51.200 --> 4:31:57.200]  now they don't really care so much uh... we realized too we're dealing with people who
[4:31:57.200 --> 4:32:02.320]  don't believe that to give us any answers to anything that they're beyond answering to the public
[4:32:02.960 --> 4:32:08.400]  and in the past they just ignored the public altogether and and so did the press on their
[4:32:08.400 --> 4:32:13.280]  behalf but that's in the open today because they're on a roll and to be honest with you
[4:32:13.280 --> 4:32:17.920]  these really think that most of the general public of the world are so apathetic now that
[4:32:17.920 --> 4:32:21.680]  they don't really care who rules them or what kind of system they're ruled under
[4:32:21.680 --> 4:32:26.240]  yeah that's what they that's what they think that the picking apathy to such an extent
[4:32:26.240 --> 4:32:31.440]  a level now and that was predicted by better and Russell in the fifties they would create apathy
[4:32:31.440 --> 4:32:35.440]  and once you're apathetic you allow yourself to be manipulated or controlled
[4:32:35.440 --> 4:32:41.680]  and of course his quote was a revolt by the general public uh... the proletariat will be
[4:32:41.680 --> 4:32:44.960]  as impossible and unthinkable as a revolt
[4:32:44.960 --> 4:32:48.560]  sheep against the practice of eating mutton that's right
[4:32:48.560 --> 4:32:50.720]  that's right those that don't know mutton is sheep
[4:32:50.720 --> 4:32:54.800]  and a rockefeller and said himself said that the people will come to them
[4:32:54.800 --> 4:32:59.680]  with perfect docility at the end and that's because they've trained the public first
[4:32:59.680 --> 4:33:02.800]  madison avenue makes you feel inadequate women especially
[4:33:02.800 --> 4:33:06.560]  but men men it's all acting tough and rude but not being involved in your country or
[4:33:06.560 --> 4:33:10.560]  being involved or kill them brown people that's manly but then bowing down to the corrupt system
[4:33:10.560 --> 4:33:14.720]  and shaking it you know in the irs once they make you feel inadequate
[4:33:14.720 --> 4:33:18.960]  then you have no respect for yourself and then you're always looking for a leader
[4:33:18.960 --> 4:33:21.360]  to save you now again ellen's got to go in just a moment
[4:33:21.360 --> 4:33:24.160]  we'll give each caller one minute a quick answer from alan watt
[4:33:24.160 --> 4:33:27.120]  leo and mash you're on the air with alan watt
[4:33:27.120 --> 4:33:31.920]  hi thanks for taking the call um i think what the factor we're missing here is the
[4:33:31.920 --> 4:33:36.960]  quick gesture factor now the other day i spoke to uh...
[4:33:36.960 --> 4:33:41.840]  jack mclam and uh... they're talking about the uh... they want to shut down
[4:33:41.840 --> 4:33:45.520]  it with free speech uh... anti-free speech they want to hate
[4:33:45.520 --> 4:33:49.280]  declared to the truth to be hate speech yes i think what we should do is dress up
[4:33:49.280 --> 4:33:54.640]  as gay people around dc and go to go to dc and and ask them to ban the bible
[4:33:54.640 --> 4:33:58.000]  because then that'll bring the whole thing to a head you see then the media
[4:33:58.000 --> 4:34:00.960]  see they can play those type of tricks having the adl and others have been
[4:34:00.960 --> 4:34:04.880]  caught dressing up like nazis you know trying to get hate laws passed
[4:34:04.880 --> 4:34:07.600]  then they would expose that we set that up
[4:34:07.600 --> 4:34:11.040]  but see that's why being moral you never really have that problem because
[4:34:11.040 --> 4:34:14.640]  you understand the straight and narrow look look being clean not that i'm
[4:34:14.640 --> 4:34:18.320]  perfect you know i'd drink and smoke and i try to quit all the time but i mean
[4:34:18.320 --> 4:34:21.280]  i'm weak but the point is is that
[4:34:21.280 --> 4:34:24.320]  i got all these women's literally folks and most of her probably government
[4:34:24.320 --> 4:34:27.120]  just throwing themselves throwing themselves throwing themselves at me
[4:34:27.120 --> 4:34:30.320]  and i know that number one i wouldn't get my work done number two i'm most
[4:34:30.320 --> 4:34:32.720]  importantly i'm married and love my children and my family
[4:34:32.720 --> 4:34:36.240]  but but number three or four
[4:34:36.240 --> 4:34:39.520]  you know morals are have been developed and designed because it's what it's
[4:34:39.520 --> 4:34:42.560]  what makes you straight and strong and focused
[4:34:42.560 --> 4:34:46.080]  but the general public is all animalistic down i mean i'm more into the
[4:34:46.080 --> 4:34:49.360]  stars and space and the mysteries of the universe and
[4:34:49.360 --> 4:34:52.560]  working with and helping others i got a bigger thrill out of that
[4:34:52.560 --> 4:34:56.560]  and so it's you can't buy me off you can't buy me off with sex money power
[4:34:56.560 --> 4:35:00.000]  you can't threaten me to back off because who i am and being good and being a
[4:35:00.000 --> 4:35:03.360]  good sentient creature is more important
[4:35:03.360 --> 4:35:06.560]  to me than all the treasure in the world which is all a bunch of crap
[4:35:06.560 --> 4:35:11.600]  so yeah that's what the globalist hate because they can't control us
[4:35:11.600 --> 4:35:15.680]  alan you want to speak to that yes once again
[4:35:15.680 --> 4:35:18.720]  if you go back to the writings of russell and hoxley and others that
[4:35:18.720 --> 4:35:23.120]  talked about creating a degrading a degraded society
[4:35:23.120 --> 4:35:26.720]  uh promoting sex to the extreme even though the people would be technically
[4:35:26.720 --> 4:35:29.680]  sterile he said that hox julien hoxley said this
[4:35:29.680 --> 4:35:33.360]  he said to be technically sterile they'll be encouraged to basically
[4:35:33.360 --> 4:35:37.200]  um have as many partners as they want in other words they're debasing us all
[4:35:37.200 --> 4:35:41.680]  into uh purely animalistic behavior uh where
[4:35:41.680 --> 4:35:46.720]  we have a gratification from our senses filled so quickly and easily
[4:35:46.720 --> 4:35:51.120]  and but the thing is there's no human bonding involved in any of this there's
[4:35:51.120 --> 4:35:55.680]  no long-term bonding uh that was part of it to destroy bonding in
[4:35:55.680 --> 4:35:59.280]  fact it's very very shallow it's and i want you to expand on this you know
[4:35:59.280 --> 4:36:02.800]  in college you go to parties or whatever you know porn's on the tv it's
[4:36:02.800 --> 4:36:06.000]  everywhere for those older folks that don't know it's just everywhere now
[4:36:06.000 --> 4:36:10.160]  and i noticed that that that it destroyed gratification
[4:36:10.160 --> 4:36:14.000]  and it and it actually like burns your nerves away mentally it it it makes
[4:36:14.000 --> 4:36:18.160]  sure you can't enjoy the real thing anymore and you know so thank god i'm
[4:36:18.160 --> 4:36:22.000]  not into that uh but but the and studies have shown that you know they
[4:36:22.000 --> 4:36:24.720]  thought porn 50 years ago before they made it widespread
[4:36:24.720 --> 4:36:28.080]  would make people sex maniacs it does the opposite and of course they've done
[4:36:28.080 --> 4:36:31.920]  these tests a hundred years ago they knew it actually destroys people's real
[4:36:31.920 --> 4:36:35.840]  passion and and and then loving a woman loving a man loving your
[4:36:35.840 --> 4:36:39.600]  children defending that the true bond speak to that
[4:36:39.600 --> 4:36:43.840]  well that's just that it will destroy the idea of love in fact
[4:36:43.840 --> 4:36:47.920]  um as and what it does is make a divorce is that the activity
[4:36:47.920 --> 4:36:52.160]  from the relationship with the person so that activity becomes purely physical
[4:36:52.160 --> 4:36:58.000]  uh gratification and that's an intent to destroy the ability to bond with
[4:36:58.000 --> 4:37:02.720]  the person that's what 1984 was about yes and it's a science again
[4:37:02.720 --> 4:37:08.960]  you see any instinct any drive can be can be uh by propaganda and repetition
[4:37:08.960 --> 4:37:12.720]  everywhere that you look um it can be made into an addiction
[4:37:12.720 --> 4:37:17.360]  an utter addiction in one way or another until people are addicted to having
[4:37:17.360 --> 4:37:21.200]  partners but not to having a relationship that and then and then all
[4:37:21.200 --> 4:37:25.040]  these messages say children are bad children are a hassle uh but then you
[4:37:25.040 --> 4:37:28.720]  have all these childless people that are totally unhappy and the fulfilled folks
[4:37:28.720 --> 4:37:32.480]  have the children yes i was looking at a site recently
[4:37:32.480 --> 4:37:35.680]  uh where that there actually is an article that says uh the children are
[4:37:35.680 --> 4:37:40.960]  carbon monsters who wants them uh so that's that's all that horrible carbon
[4:37:40.960 --> 4:37:45.040]  footprint gotta stop having children in fact australia is proposing a one-child
[4:37:45.040 --> 4:37:48.720]  policy now yes and that again china was to be the model
[4:37:48.720 --> 4:37:52.800]  state for the entire world and that's the way they're going in china the
[4:37:52.800 --> 4:37:56.000]  government still is a communist type government is in other words is
[4:37:56.000 --> 4:38:00.240]  dictatorial it's one party system uh they're they're all multimillionaires
[4:38:00.240 --> 4:38:04.400]  at the top there and that's what they want to come out openly with for the
[4:38:04.400 --> 4:38:08.240]  rest of the world where there's a one party system one boss they tell you
[4:38:08.240 --> 4:38:13.360]  how to live what to eat what to do uh walk into the sterilization factory
[4:38:13.360 --> 4:38:17.360]  and be a good citizen etc etc that's what they're bringing in unbelievable who's
[4:38:17.360 --> 4:38:24.640]  up next to him all right john and canada go ahead
[4:38:24.640 --> 4:38:29.760]  alex it's great to speak with you listen i just woke up last week and after
[4:38:29.760 --> 4:38:34.320]  listening to your show i had to call in a close friend of mine at truth action
[4:38:34.320 --> 4:38:37.600]  auto at dot com told me about the obama deception
[4:38:37.600 --> 4:38:40.960]  then i've never been scared as much in my whole life
[4:38:40.960 --> 4:38:45.680]  then i watched end game my god alex how could we be so blind
[4:38:45.680 --> 4:38:48.480]  i've always known the government was corrupt you know but
[4:38:48.480 --> 4:38:54.000]  never did i imagine it was this bad um you know what we really need to do is
[4:38:54.000 --> 4:38:59.200]  stand together against this tyranny and then say that i will not allow my
[4:38:59.200 --> 4:39:02.720]  children to grow up and be slaves but they have the same right to freedom as
[4:39:02.720 --> 4:39:06.640]  the belterbergs do this is foolish how can we allow this to happen to the
[4:39:06.640 --> 4:39:10.880]  state councils your town councils and read these mainstream news articles
[4:39:10.880 --> 4:39:14.160]  saying children are carbon monsters and saying your phony environmental
[4:39:14.160 --> 4:39:16.960]  movement isn't about saving the rainforest of the plankton that is in
[4:39:16.960 --> 4:39:20.880]  danger it's about taxing the carbon footprint and the carbon cycle and
[4:39:20.880 --> 4:39:23.760]  micromanaging every facet of our lives or point out how they're
[4:39:23.760 --> 4:39:26.800]  announcing in canada and in the u.s. they're going to put troops on the
[4:39:26.800 --> 4:39:31.040]  streets that are now doing it if all of you go and create a huge chatter instead
[4:39:31.040 --> 4:39:35.120]  of going into being scared if they're able to cow us and
[4:39:35.120 --> 4:39:38.160]  buffalo us and intimidate us into submission they're going to win allen
[4:39:38.160 --> 4:39:42.080]  want there's no doubt at all and he used some of their own court cases that
[4:39:42.080 --> 4:39:45.040]  were meant for propaganda purposes against them
[4:39:45.040 --> 4:39:48.400]  because recently we're an environmental officer
[4:39:48.400 --> 4:39:51.360]  attached to a company was fired it was such a pain
[4:39:51.360 --> 4:39:55.040]  to the company and they thought they get some good publicity out of it
[4:39:55.040 --> 4:39:58.160]  but it was ruled in the court decision in the u.s. that
[4:39:58.160 --> 4:40:01.600]  that the belief and sustainability and environmentalism
[4:40:01.600 --> 4:40:06.080]  to do with man-causing carbon footprints and so on was someone's
[4:40:06.080 --> 4:40:11.680]  philosophical belief not a fact but a philosophical belief so why are we all
[4:40:11.680 --> 4:40:15.280]  having to give up everything for someone's philosophical belief
[4:40:15.280 --> 4:40:18.880]  and again it's all peer pressure sir good to have you on board now share the

[4:41:05.120 --> 4:41:09.040]  i i've got um i've got a question for alan specifically
[4:41:09.040 --> 4:41:12.720]  regarding canada's role in the n w o
[4:41:12.720 --> 4:41:16.480]  i have a a friend who is uh...
[4:41:16.480 --> 4:41:20.960]  very high up the uh... at wik gundy which is between imperial bank commerce
[4:41:20.960 --> 4:41:25.520]  yeah and he speaks about canada as being the administrator of the new world
[4:41:25.520 --> 4:41:30.080]  order and that that the canadian dollar at our pension will be relatively
[4:41:30.080 --> 4:41:34.720]  fatal uh... comparatively to the u s and also because
[4:41:34.720 --> 4:41:39.120]  canada's have already been brought in line i don't really think the canadian dollar worry
[4:41:39.120 --> 4:41:42.960]  no uh... for the end of a little comment to that i want to hear alan's comment
[4:41:42.960 --> 4:41:47.200]  then i've got one go ahead alan yeah well i also know people up at the bank
[4:41:47.200 --> 4:41:52.560]  uh... at the same bank too and uh... that is what they're told so they do
[4:41:52.560 --> 4:41:58.560]  believe that canada has the population so happy drunk at weekends with sports
[4:41:58.560 --> 4:42:00.480]  and hockey and all the rest of it but they don't care
[4:42:00.480 --> 4:42:05.600]  technically i have to say it's really true with most people uh... but uh...
[4:42:05.600 --> 4:42:11.040]  canada it has a much bigger role than it lets on to have and i don't know what
[4:42:11.040 --> 4:42:14.960]  people realize that there's some very very old wealthy families international
[4:42:14.960 --> 4:42:19.360]  bankers living in canada yes and they give our orders to a lot of the big boys
[4:42:19.360 --> 4:42:22.480]  in the states in fact yes they've decided to make
[4:42:22.480 --> 4:42:26.080]  canada kind of one of their few safe zones that's why they have some of
[4:42:26.080 --> 4:42:30.640]  those dr coney and anti-free speech things and canada is a beta test
[4:42:30.640 --> 4:42:34.240]  of a similar model to england but even more advanced at many levels
[4:42:34.240 --> 4:42:38.080]  of how to have a highly controlled society without people seeing it
[4:42:38.080 --> 4:42:42.160]  they call china laboratory they call canada laboratory the u.s is a lot
[4:42:42.160 --> 4:42:45.360]  they have different competing but similar systems
[4:42:45.360 --> 4:42:48.800]  they're beta testing separately i mean notice canada
[4:42:48.800 --> 4:42:52.000]  is very hard to get into now and they check your political background and
[4:42:52.000 --> 4:42:54.560]  yell and scream at you and it's turning into a giant
[4:42:54.560 --> 4:42:58.480]  fortress uh... and it's it has incredible resources allen
[4:42:58.480 --> 4:43:02.400]  yes and i i i i i'm in the seventies and eighties when i was uh... over in
[4:43:02.400 --> 4:43:04.880]  europe i traveled an awful lot through europe
[4:43:04.880 --> 4:43:08.640]  what astonished me was that each country had its own little it was indeed a
[4:43:08.640 --> 4:43:12.880]  little laboratory holland was testing out the reversal of roles they
[4:43:12.880 --> 4:43:15.280]  they paid men to stay at home with the children
[4:43:15.280 --> 4:43:19.280]  and paid women to go out to work uh... and so every country you country that
[4:43:19.280 --> 4:43:22.160]  you went to sweden was pushing the sex to the extreme
[4:43:22.160 --> 4:43:25.360]  until to see if they were the first ones who would need partners
[4:43:25.360 --> 4:43:28.400]  because that would be so sex was so easily available
[4:43:28.400 --> 4:43:31.440]  and i i realized every country was being tested
[4:43:31.440 --> 4:43:35.360]  and now they're using the findings of all these countries to create a global
[4:43:35.360 --> 4:43:39.200]  society that bring all the things that work together into one system
[4:43:39.200 --> 4:43:42.320]  and and and you researched enough of this data
[4:43:42.320 --> 4:43:45.680]  you then come up with a prime projection of exactly what they're doing
[4:43:45.680 --> 4:43:49.600]  and then years later you come across a ran corporation or a un document
[4:43:49.600 --> 4:43:52.800]  and it's like you wrote it because you know you're an intellectual you've
[4:43:52.800 --> 4:43:56.000]  studied it you've looked at it and then you already know what their
[4:43:56.000 --> 4:43:58.880]  plan is and then you find actual documents where
[4:43:58.880 --> 4:44:02.480]  what you know your understanding was a hundred percent
[4:44:02.480 --> 4:44:06.000]  and there's only a few people alan watt myself and really
[4:44:06.000 --> 4:44:08.480]  frankly alan when it comes to the technical side because you do a lot of
[4:44:08.480 --> 4:44:12.160]  research i do too a lot of other folks are great patriots they're just not as
[4:44:12.160 --> 4:44:15.920]  bookworm-ish as we are but i mean have you had that experience where you know
[4:44:15.920 --> 4:44:18.240]  their plan and then later you actually find a document
[4:44:18.240 --> 4:44:21.840]  that's word for word what you'd already with thousands of pieces of data put
[4:44:21.840 --> 4:44:25.040]  together yes you find many documents often in the same
[4:44:25.040 --> 4:44:29.360]  but the same story on the same particular area that you're looking into
[4:44:29.360 --> 4:44:32.560]  and i often say that life is boring because once you've understood and read
[4:44:32.560 --> 4:44:35.360]  all their books you know the implementation scheme you know where
[4:44:35.360 --> 4:44:38.320]  they're going you're never surprised because you know that
[4:44:38.320 --> 4:44:41.520]  put the next step and the next step and the next step will be
[4:44:41.520 --> 4:44:46.560]  absolutely michael thank you denison colorado and then shawn denis one minute
[4:44:46.560 --> 4:44:51.040]  yeah i got have you heard of gene schroeder i didn't call campbell colorado
[4:44:51.040 --> 4:44:55.120]  i have a refresh me yeah it's not the war in emergency powers
[4:44:55.120 --> 4:44:58.640]  about oh yeah a decade ago we put out stuff exposing that yeah we've been
[4:44:58.640 --> 4:45:02.800]  under the war bars actually it's true dr gene schroeder
[4:45:02.800 --> 4:45:05.760]  if that was to be reversed do you think that would have any effect on the
[4:45:05.760 --> 4:45:09.760]  current environment absolutely you know they operate by their own laws
[4:45:09.760 --> 4:45:13.120]  and so we're operating under state of emergency alan watt
[4:45:13.120 --> 4:45:17.600]  yes absolutely again everything's been published before
[4:45:17.600 --> 4:45:21.680]  by people who stumble across the truth and uh and you're going to pick up all
[4:45:21.680 --> 4:45:25.680]  these books and use them for evidence that this is an agenda as a plan
[4:45:25.680 --> 4:45:30.240]  here's the proof that's all documented to show people for at least for those who
[4:45:30.240 --> 4:45:33.840]  can get away from television mentality exactly they beta test it like they're
[4:45:33.840 --> 4:45:37.120]  beta testing in a little over 50 cities i know of right now
[4:45:37.120 --> 4:45:40.800]  making the cities and counties make you register your guns in your ammo
[4:45:40.800 --> 4:45:43.840]  and then they'll say oh look we tested it worked great let's do it everywhere
[4:45:43.840 --> 4:45:47.120]  you know they're beta testing one child policies through cities that tax you
[4:45:47.120 --> 4:45:50.320]  have kids you know they're beta testing and then they admit
[4:45:50.320 --> 4:45:54.080]  they're beta testing for and the stuff they're beta testing
[4:45:54.080 --> 4:45:58.160]  they're now rolling out in a year or two not 10 years again it's very fast
[4:45:58.160 --> 4:46:01.440]  we're like everything's quickening right now
[4:46:01.440 --> 4:46:05.920]  yes and and also to uh you have an international association of mirrors
[4:46:05.920 --> 4:46:08.880]  for instance all the mirrors are in touch with mirrors across the planet
[4:46:08.880 --> 4:46:12.320]  national international association of governors county commissioners
[4:46:12.320 --> 4:46:16.560]  uh county man city managers go ahead yeah police chiefs as well
[4:46:16.560 --> 4:46:20.480]  and and whatever works in one country to an extent especially if it's profitable
[4:46:20.480 --> 4:46:24.160]  to them they will implement in every other country
[4:46:24.160 --> 4:46:28.000]  pretty well shortly afterwards as well with the the Toronto mayor a few years
[4:46:28.000 --> 4:46:32.080]  ago took a whole delegation of the Toronto council over to Holland to study
[4:46:32.080 --> 4:46:36.720]  the red light district to see how they worked it out for taxation purposes
[4:46:36.720 --> 4:46:40.240]  exactly let me give you one microcosm how do they implement they say we got a
[4:46:40.240 --> 4:46:44.240]  $787 million stimulus package every other country has a package
[4:46:44.240 --> 4:46:47.920]  that's taxpayer money they then tell a city in a county do this
[4:46:47.920 --> 4:46:50.240]  adopt these laws and then we'll give you the money
[4:46:50.240 --> 4:46:53.520]  yeah okay that's what they call you know the these funded mandates
[4:46:53.520 --> 4:46:57.200]  and so so that's how they have it all unified
[4:46:57.200 --> 4:47:01.280]  and then privately insurance companies will say if you start running check
[4:47:01.280 --> 4:47:03.840]  points with the army at it or if you start running people through the
[4:47:03.840 --> 4:47:07.200]  Patriot Act database or in a car we'll give you a discount
[4:47:07.200 --> 4:47:11.280]  so they incentivize it all and then have everybody jump through the hoops to do it
[4:47:11.280 --> 4:47:15.120]  I appreciate your call Dennis Sean in Toronto last caller
[4:47:15.120 --> 4:47:20.080]  hello Alex and Alan I'm glad to finally be on the phone with you
[4:47:20.080 --> 4:47:23.840]  um I just have a comment and then a question my comment is
[4:47:23.840 --> 4:47:29.440]  this I think the most important thing that you've done Alex as far as
[4:47:29.440 --> 4:47:34.000]  exposure is the bohemian grove I think that is
[4:47:34.000 --> 4:47:37.280]  far and above the most important thing because
[4:47:37.280 --> 4:47:44.880]  it shows the true level of twisted evil of the most
[4:47:44.880 --> 4:47:49.360]  powerful people that are involved in this whole new world order
[4:47:49.360 --> 4:47:52.880]  situation Hollywood tells us I was I saw the ninth gate
[4:47:52.880 --> 4:47:57.200]  on the stair stepper this weekend on cable and uh you know and I've seen it
[4:47:57.200 --> 4:48:00.000]  before so I watched the last hour of it and and and what all these Hollywood
[4:48:00.000 --> 4:48:03.040]  movie tell you when you go to the big castle chateau in
[4:48:03.040 --> 4:48:06.320]  England or in or in France or in New York you know
[4:48:06.320 --> 4:48:10.480]  eyes wide shut the elite is engaging in satanic ceremonies
[4:48:10.480 --> 4:48:14.240]  well in real life that's what they're doing and why is this from a sociological
[4:48:14.240 --> 4:48:18.240]  perspective even if you're an atheist because they're psycho killers
[4:48:18.240 --> 4:48:22.000]  they're going to have a religion that matches their flair
[4:48:22.000 --> 4:48:25.520]  for blood and death and torture and and and the enjoyment of hurting innocents
[4:48:25.520 --> 4:48:29.920]  Alan one yes it is uh they begin themselves whether
[4:48:29.920 --> 4:48:33.360]  they believe it or not so some can believe in it some don't have to but
[4:48:33.360 --> 4:48:38.960]  they all attend the same kind of orgies etc on that level for their drugs etc
[4:48:38.960 --> 4:48:42.000]  and even the police will stay away the way or the police chief might be there
[4:48:42.000 --> 4:48:44.720]  in your own community and they do have the eyes wide shut
[4:48:44.720 --> 4:48:48.560]  type ceremonies because they'll they love to to play it being gods
[4:48:48.560 --> 4:48:52.080]  openly amongst themselves well it's also about how they're radical they'll sit
[4:48:52.080 --> 4:48:54.640]  there right in front of the police chief with the governor and just sit there
[4:48:54.640 --> 4:48:57.280]  and have sex and then drink blood and take a baby
[4:48:57.280 --> 4:49:02.480]  and yeah i've got the physical will and power to kill
[4:49:02.480 --> 4:49:07.200]  this little kid satan and and again it's all
[4:49:07.200 --> 4:49:10.160]  about they've got the willingness to go to this level of darkness
[4:49:10.160 --> 4:49:13.920]  Alan why yeah what they show to each other is that they have no inhibitions
[4:49:13.920 --> 4:49:17.920]  that's a must be to join the ministry you have no inhibitions
[4:49:17.920 --> 4:49:22.640]  sexually that's for male or female or whatever and i mean whatever
[4:49:22.640 --> 4:49:27.520]  um and that's uh you're not embarrassed by any you're not inhibited
[4:49:27.520 --> 4:49:30.720]  and embarrassed by any particular situation so you've got to be almost
[4:49:30.720 --> 4:49:34.400]  but very ultimately haven't guard and everything that you do
[4:49:34.400 --> 4:49:37.600]  amongst your own to show to show they have no inhibitions
[4:49:37.600 --> 4:49:40.480]  all right call her at your question because i've really twisted Alan's arm
[4:49:40.480 --> 4:49:45.600]  go ahead right um the one the one question i had was this um as far as
[4:49:45.600 --> 4:49:52.240]  female type camp um military forces put out on the street
[4:49:52.240 --> 4:49:56.640]  this type of thing that is horribly going on in the states
[4:49:56.640 --> 4:50:03.120]  um do you uh alex personally have any evidence or knowledge
[4:50:03.120 --> 4:50:06.800]  that that type of a thing is happening up here
[4:50:06.800 --> 4:50:11.120]  no absurd sir it's been in the toronto star that they built the fema camps and
[4:50:11.120 --> 4:50:15.680]  they had the ad or they had the yeah yeah yeah they had generals in the like
[4:50:15.680 --> 4:50:18.560]  ten mainstream articles a week ago it was like more than ten
[4:50:18.560 --> 4:50:22.080]  saying we're going to patrol the streets we're going to do cordons we're
[4:50:22.080 --> 4:50:25.120]  we're preparing to lock down canadian cities and put people
[4:50:25.120 --> 4:50:28.240]  uh in camps i'm going to let you go there i know alan's always informed
[4:50:28.240 --> 4:50:32.960]  alan you saw the articles i'm sure yes and i also know that many of the closed
[4:50:32.960 --> 4:50:37.120]  bases are still attended and kept up to scratch with empty beds
[4:50:37.120 --> 4:50:40.880]  uh and i know where they are to even Ontario and different places in canada
[4:50:40.880 --> 4:50:43.840]  and that again is for america's purposes you
[4:50:43.840 --> 4:50:48.640]  yeah they broke canada in five parts it was in the bunch of canadian papers just
[4:50:48.640 --> 4:50:52.000]  um in fact let me give people the exact headline we'll pull this up at the end
[4:50:52.000 --> 4:50:56.640]  the exact headline there was so many let me think one was toronto star there were
[4:50:56.640 --> 4:50:59.760]  some other ones um
[4:50:59.760 --> 4:51:06.480]  um military to take lead role in canada
[4:51:06.480 --> 4:51:11.040]  emergencies military to take lead role another one was
[4:51:11.040 --> 4:51:15.040]  military to patrol rowdy bar district that's was in barry
[4:51:15.040 --> 4:51:23.840]  ontario and that that's correct it's what they're doing all right let me pull up more hold on
[4:51:23.840 --> 4:51:28.960]  united states mexico canada sign agreement to share forces during disasters
[4:51:28.960 --> 4:51:32.000]  and it said that we use each other's trips each other's countries
[4:51:32.000 --> 4:51:35.920]  uh i mean there's many others folks uh but uh there you have it
[4:51:35.920 --> 4:51:42.240]  alan wanting closing um what do the elite think of you and i i mean i know i've
[4:51:42.240 --> 4:51:44.560]  talked to some of them and they've laughed and said look the public scum they
[4:51:44.560 --> 4:51:48.000]  want to be destroyed let them you know join us ha ha ha i mean that's kind of the
[4:51:48.000 --> 4:51:52.560]  attitude uh you can't you know evil knows it can wreck things break things it
[4:51:52.560 --> 4:51:56.320]  doesn't have to keep all the plates piled up you know you know in a juggling act
[4:51:56.320 --> 4:52:00.160]  where you got a hundred plates in your hands and and and and and teacups
[4:52:00.160 --> 4:52:04.320]  they don't have to play by rules they can eviscerate humanity our soul our basic
[4:52:04.320 --> 4:52:08.480]  coding what's good you know they're they're chaotic they're destructive the
[4:52:08.480 --> 4:52:12.560]  good guys play by the rules and try to help and have a heart uh you know how
[4:52:12.560 --> 4:52:16.480]  do we beat that and what do they think of us
[4:52:16.480 --> 4:52:22.000]  they're very puzzled by us because they can't imagine anyone doing something
[4:52:22.000 --> 4:52:25.360]  uh where there's no personal benefit involved whatsoever
[4:52:25.360 --> 4:52:28.960]  because they live for that that's that that's also the Achilles heel
[4:52:28.960 --> 4:52:32.880]  each one of the helpers for the elite has a personal benefit that they're in
[4:52:32.880 --> 4:52:38.240]  for gain personally and uh if it's underhanded or crooked they
[4:52:38.240 --> 4:52:42.000]  don't care they think that everyone is the same as themselves and so when
[4:52:42.000 --> 4:52:45.280]  someone comes along and does something for some other purpose
[4:52:45.280 --> 4:52:49.520]  or says it's for a moral purpose or whatever uh you you're genuinely a
[4:52:49.520 --> 4:52:53.440]  puzzle to them because they cannot relate to you at all
[4:52:53.440 --> 4:52:57.680]  at all and uh if you if you have no your staff and you know what's all about
[4:52:57.680 --> 4:53:01.120]  what's going on they they would like to recruit you
[4:53:01.120 --> 4:53:05.120]  uh and they cannot understand why you you won't take the payoff or the bait or
[4:53:05.120 --> 4:53:08.480]  whatever and be one of them and live the high life
[4:53:08.480 --> 4:53:12.800]  which is actually a prison i mean it's and it's a treasure it's so valuable
[4:53:12.800 --> 4:53:16.640]  to tie into the life force of the universe to literally be involved
[4:53:16.640 --> 4:53:19.920]  realizing i'm going to live forever through my progeny even if my progeny
[4:53:19.920 --> 4:53:23.520]  my line ends i live through humanity and i imagine
[4:53:23.520 --> 4:53:28.880]  us you know really in this cocoon stage for what humanity could develop into
[4:53:28.880 --> 4:53:31.440]  if we're given time and don't let these elite backstabbers
[4:53:31.440 --> 4:53:35.200]  to me it's very evil they claim they're elite to suppress and dumb down
[4:53:35.200 --> 4:53:39.360]  and and you know i love seeing others do well and maximizing beauty and
[4:53:39.360 --> 4:53:42.720]  intelligence and honor and potential and i love innocence
[4:53:42.720 --> 4:53:46.160]  and they love destruction and power and and all the and you know and then
[4:53:46.160 --> 4:53:49.440]  indoctrinating the troops into killing a million three hundred thousand iraqis
[4:53:49.440 --> 4:53:53.440]  you know they love these rituals of destruction and i see them destroying
[4:53:53.440 --> 4:53:57.200]  their own soul and attacking the very heart of humanity
[4:53:57.200 --> 4:54:01.920]  and so i'm into the species surviving having a chance to decide what the
[4:54:01.920 --> 4:54:05.840]  species wants to become in elevating enlightenment
[4:54:05.840 --> 4:54:09.760]  and so i don't care if they kill me because i know i live on and my only
[4:54:09.760 --> 4:54:12.720]  i'm worried about the species i'm worried about the species merging with
[4:54:12.720 --> 4:54:17.040]  technology too quickly losing what our true potential was
[4:54:17.040 --> 4:54:21.840]  and so i'm almost like a conservator who who you know who wants to keep these
[4:54:21.840 --> 4:54:25.600]  great works of art alive because they are alive and will grow into something
[4:54:25.600 --> 4:54:28.960]  even greater i'm like someone trying to maintain the original
[4:54:28.960 --> 4:54:33.280]  seeds and you know so they can be planted do you see what i'm saying
[4:54:33.280 --> 4:54:37.840]  yes and evil itself can give you nothing but evil that's the key to it as well
[4:54:37.840 --> 4:54:40.400]  nothing good will come out of this nothing that you
[4:54:40.400 --> 4:54:43.840]  you know that's an old old um the debate in different religions can good come
[4:54:43.840 --> 4:54:48.720]  out of evil and technically no it cannot evil can only spawn more evil and
[4:54:48.720 --> 4:54:53.360]  cruelty and hatred and and discussed at their own actions
[4:54:53.360 --> 4:54:57.040]  um so we this is the ultimate battle really it's your soul
[4:54:57.040 --> 4:54:59.760]  or after that thing which makes you and
[4:54:59.760 --> 4:55:04.000]  individualistically you that's what they're after they don't like the
[4:55:04.000 --> 4:55:08.240]  unknown factor they want a bunch of people at clones walking around the
[4:55:08.240 --> 4:55:11.840]  planet serving them that are perfectly predictable
[4:55:11.840 --> 4:55:15.200]  and that is evil it is it is it is stunting
[4:55:15.200 --> 4:55:20.560]  and blunting destiny yes absolutely absolute see their heaven their utopia
[4:55:20.560 --> 4:55:25.200]  is our hell that's the bottom line well ellen watt tell folks how they can

[4:56:34.560 --> 4:56:38.960]  and i have
[4:56:40.000 --> 4:56:42.960]  done the research
[4:56:45.120 --> 4:56:48.880]  and the elite are like adults they are just more advanced
[4:56:48.880 --> 4:56:52.480]  they understand how things work and they have tried to keep
[4:56:52.480 --> 4:56:56.560]  the people in like a perpetual uh i think they're still a line connected

[4:57:02.480 --> 4:57:06.400]  uh let me go back this is a key thought okay i want to relay this is what it's
[4:57:06.400 --> 4:57:09.280]  this is what is at my heart of hearts and we're gonna go back to rebroadcast
[4:57:09.280 --> 4:57:12.720]  with the kevin booth cia drug dealing report and then the police report the
[4:57:12.720 --> 4:57:16.560]  military spying on us all the rest of it
[4:57:16.560 --> 4:57:20.640]  at my core at my very heart it's like this i'm
[4:57:20.640 --> 4:57:25.200]  35 years old i have a crude knowledge it's advancing exponentially every week
[4:57:25.200 --> 4:57:29.200]  now i look at it with marvel at how ignorant and
[4:57:29.200 --> 4:57:33.280]  shuttered and and and and and uninformed in a wake i was say 15 years
[4:57:33.280 --> 4:57:37.040]  ago and i was more advanced than most adults then
[4:57:37.040 --> 4:57:40.800]  and i think of the potential i could grow into for all my problems and foibles
[4:57:40.800 --> 4:57:44.720]  and then i want to see others do well and i have a love affair with
[4:57:44.720 --> 4:57:50.160]  creativity and beauty and and and goodness
[4:57:50.160 --> 4:57:54.640]  and wanting to lift people up and because i know i'm connected to the
[4:57:54.640 --> 4:57:58.400]  species in the whole universe whether you're black white german jewish
[4:57:58.400 --> 4:58:03.120]  chinese doesn't matter i i understand that i understand the systems of control
[4:58:03.120 --> 4:58:07.040]  and so i don't get on a power trip because you know there's a five-year-old
[4:58:07.040 --> 4:58:10.240]  kid walking down the street and drive by and go i know more than that five-year-old
[4:58:10.240 --> 4:58:13.680]  well i could sucker that five-year-old with candy
[4:58:13.680 --> 4:58:17.280]  you know and and get them in the car and go hurt them or i could go sucker some
[4:58:17.280 --> 4:58:20.720]  18-year-old chick and boss are around and pamper around and
[4:58:20.720 --> 4:58:24.320]  you know that's what but but see that's how criminals think
[4:58:24.320 --> 4:58:27.520]  that's how criminals operate that's how psychopaths operate they
[4:58:27.520 --> 4:58:30.160]  they love tricking a little kid to get in the car with them
[4:58:30.160 --> 4:58:33.200]  you know i would love to be able to educate a five-year-old to build them
[4:58:33.200 --> 4:58:36.160]  up to make them strong to teach them the pitfalls that
[4:58:36.160 --> 4:58:39.280]  that that i didn't learn when i was young so they could avoid all of that i
[4:58:39.280 --> 4:58:42.400]  want to give them revelation i want to give them knowledge see god wants to
[4:58:42.400 --> 4:58:46.480]  give us the little commoners the little you know people that as well
[4:58:46.480 --> 4:58:50.000]  and satan the new world order claims they're giving us all this knowledge
[4:58:50.000 --> 4:58:54.000]  no they don't all they do is actually suppress knowledge destroy people
[4:58:54.000 --> 4:58:57.040]  manipulate our basic instincts against ourselves
[4:58:57.040 --> 4:59:00.480]  and you don't believe in the devil whatever fine the group consciousness of
[4:59:00.480 --> 4:59:05.840]  of evil people or the group works they create and so that's what it comes down
[4:59:05.840 --> 4:59:09.360]  to i want to empower people i'm not on a power trip
[4:59:09.360 --> 4:59:13.040]  when some neighbor of mine is ignorant they may be 50 years old don't know how
[4:59:13.040 --> 4:59:15.280]  the world works i don't i see people that you know
[4:59:15.280 --> 4:59:17.840]  whenever they love me when they teach you something or tell you you're wrong
[4:59:17.840 --> 4:59:22.240]  they they revel in it like their ego no i'm actually embarrassed for somebody
[4:59:22.240 --> 4:59:24.480]  when they don't know something and i'm embarrassed for myself when i don't
[4:59:24.480 --> 4:59:27.840]  know something and i want to empower them with knowledge i want to
[4:59:27.840 --> 4:59:31.920]  i want to commune with them mentally psychologically spiritually
[4:59:31.920 --> 4:59:35.520]  i want to lift them up and then lift me up together rising tide raises all
[4:59:35.520 --> 4:59:40.240]  ships i want to build
[4:59:40.240 --> 4:59:44.320]  and i want to increase the goodness and and and increase
[4:59:44.320 --> 4:59:47.440]  the knowledge and and there's nothing we can't do i mean we are made in the
[4:59:47.440 --> 4:59:50.000]  image of the creator of the universe ladies and gentlemen
[4:59:50.000 --> 4:59:52.560]  and the globalists know that and they're very jealous and envious of that they
[4:59:52.560 --> 4:59:55.840]  want to hoard that knowledge for themselves and make themselves gods they
[4:59:55.840 --> 4:59:58.640]  believe instead of trying to empower everybody
[4:59:58.640 --> 5:00:03.040]  and moving towards what humanity is going to become if they don't stop us
[5:00:03.040 --> 5:00:06.720]  and so the new orders like somebody pulling over in their car
[5:00:06.720 --> 5:00:09.680]  tricking a five-year-old in the car and then taking them to a
[5:00:09.680 --> 5:00:13.200]  abandoned shack and beating their brains out and then reveling i have power
[5:00:13.200 --> 5:00:16.400]  this five-year-olds tied down i can beat them in the head with a hammer or
[5:00:16.400 --> 5:00:19.360]  man i've got power
