[00:48.520 --> 00:52.360]  Webster Griffin terribly joins us in the middle of the second hour doctor of
[00:52.360 --> 00:56.800]  history and also he's an economist to look at the economy and the fact that
[00:56.800 --> 00:59.800]  the Chinese are openly saying that the United States the private Federal Reserve
[00:59.800 --> 01:04.360]  that runs the US has already begun defaulting on the global debt via
[01:04.360 --> 01:08.040]  hyperinflation and we'll look at the geopolitical military developments the
[01:08.040 --> 01:13.440]  ongoing drone attacks in Yemen which the CIA has finally admitted they're doing
[01:13.440 --> 01:18.960]  today just huge drone attacks I mean how many countries are gonna be attacked
[01:18.960 --> 01:26.760]  when does a Skynet officially launch more of these robotic drones against the
[01:26.760 --> 01:32.560]  population of North America under the whole North com system we're gonna be
[01:32.560 --> 01:38.360]  going over all of that today obviously there have been some big new TSA
[01:38.360 --> 01:43.000]  developments the drudge report over on the right hand side under the photo of
[01:43.000 --> 01:50.040]  mr. Napolitano excuse me Janet Napolitano or Rachel Maddow whoever that
[01:50.040 --> 01:56.080]  is oh that's right no it's it's it's Mrs. no no miss Napolitano okay I get
[01:56.080 --> 02:03.280]  confused sometimes sorry miss Napolitano the head of Homeland Security you under
[02:03.280 --> 02:09.960]  that photo on the drudge report you can see our report by Paul Joseph Watson it's
[02:09.960 --> 02:15.720]  also up at info wars.com and prison planet.com dealing with a drill TSA
[02:15.720 --> 02:21.480]  security exercise covers three states 5,000 miles and this is just an
[02:21.480 --> 02:27.400]  expansion of the acclamation to the public of the rollout of the TSA
[02:27.400 --> 02:34.600]  takeover of society so we're gonna be breaking that down as well today also
[02:34.600 --> 02:39.520]  we're gonna be looking at what's happening in Europe as the austerity
[02:39.520 --> 02:44.360]  measures go into place the Greeks are again rebelling against their government
[02:44.360 --> 02:50.040]  we'll look at more the economic numbers of Obama everywhere he goes now at his
[02:50.040 --> 02:55.760]  fundraisers being heckled and booed even by his own minions and it turns out that
[02:55.760 --> 03:00.120]  we have lost millions and millions of jobs since Obama got into office when
[03:00.120 --> 03:04.080]  he promised all of this wondrous hope and change and everything was going to
[03:04.080 --> 03:09.000]  be absolutely wonderful once a big government got into place and the
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.280]  good news is more and more federal courts are ruling parts of Obama care
[03:12.280 --> 03:16.040]  unconstitutional with other federal courts announcing that they may rule
[03:16.040 --> 03:18.720]  that the whole thing is unconstitutional well if the courts
[03:18.720 --> 03:22.680]  don't rule it's unconstitutional the courts are a joke it does not take a
[03:22.680 --> 03:26.200]  constitutional lawyer to know that the government ordering you to buy a private
[03:26.200 --> 03:32.480]  service is unconstitutional and yes they've done it with insurance and now
[03:32.480 --> 03:37.120]  they're trying to expand it with health insurance and if this stands we're in a
[03:37.120 --> 03:40.680]  lot of trouble so we're gonna be going over that also Pentagon papers whistle
[03:40.680 --> 03:44.400]  blower Daniel Ellsberg says the government has ordered the media not to
[03:44.400 --> 03:49.920]  cover questions around 9-11 and integrating him with that report half of
[03:49.920 --> 03:55.480]  New Yorkers in a major scientific poll on a new investigation of 9-11 and the
[03:55.480 --> 03:59.840]  New York Times is reporting Pakistan arrest CIA informants in the supposed
[03:59.840 --> 04:04.640]  bin Laden raid no doubt to question them about the staged event also image
[04:04.640 --> 04:11.080]  comics has an issue coming out the big lie that looks at 9-11 possibly being an
[04:11.080 --> 04:16.080]  inside job it looks at both sides and USA Today has written a big article about
[04:16.080 --> 04:22.680]  it basically not attacking it so 9-11 truth becoming more and more mainstream
[04:22.680 --> 04:29.680]  with time as trust in government continues to erode at a record level so
[04:29.680 --> 04:33.720]  that's just some of the news on that front that we're going to be covering

[08:35.440 --> 08:39.560]  openly said that the United States is already defaulting on its global debt and
[08:39.560 --> 08:44.440]  that is the truth by dollar devaluation and the beginnings of hyperinflation and
[08:44.440 --> 08:50.040]  all of the other just earth-shaking economic developments that are taking
[08:50.040 --> 08:55.080]  place thanks to the private Federal Reserve that hijacked this nation 97
[08:55.080 --> 08:59.880]  years ago all of their policies meant to transfer power and wealth from the
[08:59.880 --> 09:05.000]  middle class to the offshore banking cartel now coming home to roost that is
[09:05.000 --> 09:08.400]  coming up we'll talk to the former head of Pakistani intelligence who is the
[09:08.400 --> 09:14.440]  big hero in the US in the 1980s fighting the Russians alongside the CIA

[09:19.720 --> 09:25.880]  of al-Qaeda yes the real leader of the Easter Bunny Corps he will be joining us
[09:25.880 --> 09:31.640]  coming up in T-minus 25 minutes from now okay the drudge report is again top
[09:31.640 --> 09:35.840]  linked to us on the right hand side under an image of the homeland security
[09:35.840 --> 09:42.240]  chief Janet Napolitano and we've got this report also up at info wars dot com
[09:42.240 --> 09:49.680]  and prison planet dot com by Paul Joseph Watson TSA security exercise covers
[09:49.680 --> 09:56.480]  three states 5,000 miles and in this detailed report Watson goes over the
[09:56.480 --> 10:02.320]  entire history of the TSA in the last nine years since they created these
[10:02.320 --> 10:07.040]  uniformed security forces and their own admissions and plans to be at every
[10:07.040 --> 10:11.760]  shopping mall every public school every highway with giant mobile trucks and
[10:11.760 --> 10:16.600]  they're now purchasing the big mobile x-ray trucks and of course two years
[10:16.600 --> 10:21.920]  ago in Tennessee they set up checkpoints and the governor came out and said you
[10:21.920 --> 10:25.960]  can't set up checkpoints with the Army and National Guard with you and shut
[10:25.960 --> 10:30.680]  down whole highways and search people about warrants and the TSA and we had
[10:30.680 --> 10:34.680]  state reps on from Tennessee to cover it told the governor to go jump in the
[10:34.680 --> 10:39.640]  lake to go fly a kite to just sit down and shut up basically and they
[10:39.640 --> 10:42.920]  expanded it and it was going on in four states at the time but there's only
[10:42.920 --> 10:50.440]  Tennessee that I stood up and spoke out it was in that Tennessee whole sector and
[10:50.440 --> 10:56.320]  and the three states are joining it and here is the report think the TSA was
[10:56.320 --> 11:00.040]  just restricted to airports think again if you're still living under the
[11:00.040 --> 11:04.080]  delusion the TSA is just restricted to airports then think again a joint
[11:04.080 --> 11:09.160]  viper security exercise involving military personnel has transportation
[11:09.160 --> 11:14.440]  security administration workers they're the commanders covering 5,000 miles and
[11:14.440 --> 11:19.800]  three states in this new drill illustrating once again how the TSA is
[11:19.800 --> 11:25.920]  turning into a literal occupying army for domestic repression in America and
[11:25.920 --> 11:30.120]  remember Obama during the campaign saying we need a domestic security force
[11:30.120 --> 11:35.400]  just as big just as strong as our military and then you saw two months ago
[11:35.400 --> 11:41.480]  where the TSA announced that because they're in control the federal program
[11:41.480 --> 11:47.400]  that the thousands of firemen police and medical workers the heroes of 9-11 the
[11:47.400 --> 11:50.880]  government told them the air was safe to breathe and of course now we know they
[11:50.880 --> 11:54.240]  knew it was deadly but we're told a lie Christina Todd Whitman but that's a side
[11:54.240 --> 11:58.760]  issue a more lying by this criminal so-called government that they have
[11:58.760 --> 12:03.640]  to go through an anti-terror database to be given approval every time they
[12:03.640 --> 12:08.840]  access the new government medical card and the TSA has stated under Ridge back
[12:08.840 --> 12:11.640]  when he was the head of Homeland Security that to have a job you'll have to
[12:11.640 --> 12:16.360]  have TSA federal approval through the threat fusion centers so I'm gonna be
[12:16.360 --> 12:21.120]  breaking all of this down we have a special report I put together covering
[12:21.120 --> 12:25.760]  the full spectrum of this we're gonna play that special report here in just a
[12:25.760 --> 12:31.360]  moment that has all the news clips woven into it but here's another report
[12:31.360 --> 12:36.680]  again USA Today reported on this a few months ago but CNN asked news reports
[12:36.680 --> 12:42.520]  today Union wants mailmen to thwart terror attacks and we'll come back after
[12:42.520 --> 12:49.040]  this special report and get into how every federal employee is basically
[12:49.040 --> 12:55.200]  being turned into a spy but they don't stop there cable workers phone repair
[12:55.200 --> 12:59.720]  people carpet cleaners all being turned into a stasi force but they're not
[12:59.720 --> 13:04.600]  looking for Muslim terrorist as we're told on the surface it's all about gun
[13:04.600 --> 13:09.520]  owners libertarians domestic terrorist as we're called real Americans
[13:09.520 --> 13:14.080]  it translates terrorist according to the terrorist that run our country not our
[13:14.080 --> 13:18.480]  government foreign offshore banks break the paradigm wake up save the
[13:18.480 --> 13:23.080]  Republic here is part of the special report the full report is at info wars
[13:23.080 --> 13:50.040]  dot com here it is from the info wars dot com news desk my friends for more
[13:50.040 --> 13:54.960]  than nine years we have chronicled the federal government's giant unconstitutional
[13:54.960 --> 14:02.360]  10th Amendment violating power grab that is the TSA more than eight years ago I
[14:02.360 --> 14:06.480]  read federal documents and also witnessed the head of Homeland Security Tom
[14:06.480 --> 14:11.640]  Ridge admit that in America to have a job to drive a car to have a driver's
[14:11.640 --> 14:16.760]  license to be able to travel anywhere or go to a national park that you would
[14:16.760 --> 14:22.520]  need federal approval as a quote trusted traveler over two million Americans
[14:22.520 --> 14:27.200]  are now on the new fly list they're expanding it to a no gun by list no
[14:27.200 --> 14:32.720]  jury no judge no conviction you're just put on these lists now the TSA and
[14:32.720 --> 14:36.160]  Homeland Security along with Chuckie Schumer are pushing a no travel list
[14:36.160 --> 14:40.680]  on trains buses Homeland Security has come out and announced that they're
[14:40.680 --> 14:45.840]  going to have TSA at checkpoints on major highways not just bus terminals and
[14:45.840 --> 14:52.440]  train stations this is all a strategic rollout in the name of security why
[14:52.440 --> 14:57.840]  everyone must be safe everywhere and it's the federal government's job to stick
[14:57.840 --> 15:02.160]  their hands down your pants your children's pants your wife or husband's
[15:02.160 --> 15:07.400]  pants and to grab your wife and children's genitals in the name of safety
[15:07.400 --> 15:13.080]  this is all about training you to accept total tyranny there's been a big new
[15:13.080 --> 15:20.440]  development a federal judge out in Santa Fe, New Mexico ruled that the TSA
[15:20.440 --> 15:26.960]  needed to run security at the schools and at school proms to make sure that
[15:26.960 --> 15:31.560]  the school officials of the authorities not the servants were carrying the
[15:31.560 --> 15:36.440]  searches out properly that's right a group of people who outside of law and
[15:36.440 --> 15:40.840]  federal jurisdiction have been caught stealing money from people who've been
[15:40.840 --> 15:45.560]  caught engaged in pedophilia who put you through the naked body scanners and
[15:45.560 --> 15:51.120]  then grope one-year-old babies and six-year-old girls they are now going
[15:51.120 --> 15:57.920]  to certify your local police and private security and say hey we're the federal
[15:57.920 --> 16:03.040]  government and we say you can stick your hands down people's pants at the prom
[16:03.040 --> 16:08.080]  now they announced out in Santa Fe, New Mexico that last Saturday they would be
[16:08.080 --> 16:12.920]  there a few days ago sticking the hands down the pants but for some reason the
[16:12.920 --> 16:17.800]  TSA backed off and didn't show up but never fear they have the state police
[16:17.800 --> 16:22.200]  they're groping people so the message is this you're not allowed to congregate
[16:22.200 --> 16:27.280]  anywhere and land the free home of the brave unless federally approved goons
[16:27.280 --> 16:32.000]  are there groping you. No TSA agents at one Santa Fe prom tonight despite a
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.120]  federal judge's ruling saying there had to be. Santa Fe District Superintendent
[16:36.120 --> 16:39.960]  Bobby Gutierrez says instead of TSA agents the court is allowing them to use
[16:39.960 --> 16:44.160]  state police for this evening. This is the new America they want in your
[16:44.160 --> 16:48.640]  personal space they want to prepare you with these federal grants for the police
[16:48.640 --> 16:55.200]  to take blood at warrantless DWI checkpoints to have forced inoculations
[16:55.200 --> 16:59.240]  on children outside of law as they got caught a few years ago doing the
[16:59.240 --> 17:05.720]  elementary school students and the flu inoculations it is the antithesis of
[17:05.720 --> 17:12.600]  freedom it is 180 degree polar opposite from any basic liberty and it sells the
[17:12.600 --> 17:16.280]  idea that if you give up your liberty the government's going to keep you safe
[17:16.280 --> 17:21.800]  this is a huge power grab it's a federal power grab and it's wrong and it's
[17:21.800 --> 17:27.920]  becoming absurdist so ridiculous it's hard to even believe the headlines TSA
[17:27.920 --> 17:33.560]  to oversee searches at Santa Fe prom and then a few days later no TSA agents at
[17:33.560 --> 17:39.880]  prom despite court ruling what are federal courts doing saying by God we
[17:39.880 --> 17:43.560]  need to make sure these searches of the kids are being done properly let's send
[17:43.560 --> 17:49.320]  in our crack teams of TSA agents to grope their genitals that matter how many
[17:49.320 --> 17:53.760]  states pass laws against this the feds say it's their prerogative to do it why
[17:53.760 --> 17:58.480]  do we even have states then if the feds claim there's no 10th amendment how did
[17:58.480 --> 18:04.560]  land of the free home of the brave get to the point where the TSA under a
[18:04.560 --> 18:09.200]  federal court ruling is saying they're the great arbiters of security and that
[18:09.200 --> 18:15.720]  they have to have a TSA representative at a school prom to make sure the searches
[18:15.720 --> 18:21.200]  are done properly and everybody's safe this is a monopoly on security a
[18:21.200 --> 18:27.240]  monopoly on reality and it makes no sense no one can keep you totally safe no
[18:27.240 --> 18:32.360]  one can wave a magic wand and ensure nothing will ever happen to you but
[18:32.360 --> 18:37.000]  that's what the nanny state is pushing well who protects us from the cops
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.920]  killing us with tasers who protects us from the cops throwing homeless people
[18:41.920 --> 18:45.280]  out of wheelchairs and slamming their head in the ground who protects us from
[18:45.280 --> 18:51.280]  tyranny of the state that's always been the big threat but in this bizarre 1984
[18:51.280 --> 18:55.920]  world the federal judge said well there's been complaints about kids being
[18:55.920 --> 19:01.080]  groped at school so we'll send the TSA as the experts to teach them how to do
[19:01.080 --> 19:05.400]  it that's like saying hey you know this guy beat his wife so let's send a
[19:05.400 --> 19:09.560]  serial killer to teach him how to really deal with her you know he'll chop her
[19:09.560 --> 19:17.280]  head off federal goons are there to run the frisking of high school students now
[19:17.280 --> 19:21.120]  the TSA back down this time they said because you know they couldn't get their
[19:21.120 --> 19:25.520]  people in line and so the state police did it the point is they're going to be
[19:25.520 --> 19:29.880]  back and this is being rolled out everywhere it's up to us to say no
[19:29.880 --> 19:34.080]  security consultant David Bohm says the future could include security check
[19:34.080 --> 19:38.200]  points entering all soft targets like your local department store every day

[22:21.720 --> 22:25.720]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[22:25.720 --> 22:30.080]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[22:30.080 --> 22:33.800]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their

[23:55.000 --> 24:00.840]  starts this Saturday true wilderness and urban survival company
[24:00.840 --> 24:10.560]  got a lot of news on the economy also the republican debate a few nights ago
[24:10.560 --> 24:15.720]  coming up after our first guest joins us for one segment there's a big report at
[24:15.720 --> 24:21.720]  the daily poll we've also got this linked up on info wars dot com video of it
[24:21.720 --> 24:26.360]  actually happening seeing in this info refuses to use their own poll and scores
[24:26.360 --> 24:31.840]  of other scientific polls that showed Ron Paul winning at 79% and higher and
[24:31.840 --> 24:40.080]  they use some private fake poll they did with 54 respondents to show Ron Paul
[24:40.080 --> 24:45.360]  with zero votes and that's what they put out on the news but only in the fine
[24:45.360 --> 24:53.160]  print did it show that was only 54 votes Romney 51% Bachman with 21
[24:53.160 --> 24:58.840]  polenty with nine again richwood seven Kane Herman Kane with four Santorum with
[24:58.840 --> 25:04.560]  four Paul with zero so a national user say no Ron Paul zero not telling you it
[25:04.560 --> 25:08.280]  was some internet poll they posted where nobody could see it and that their own
[25:08.280 --> 25:14.600]  real poll 79% voted so that's that's how they do slide of hand that needs to be
[25:14.600 --> 25:18.120]  investigated I tell you they are so incredibly disingenuous and there's
[25:18.120 --> 25:22.640]  video of it there's screenshots of it and then there's screenshots and video
[25:22.640 --> 25:32.720]  of all the other polls CNBC Fox you name it and CNBC did the same thing they
[25:32.720 --> 25:40.960]  showed 54 votes with Romney with 51 in fact it was a CNBC poll that CNN used
[25:40.960 --> 25:44.360]  some internet poll that I guess no one even was able to see I mean we put a
[25:44.360 --> 25:49.600]  poll up on info wars and it gets five six thousand in a day but the CNBC poll
[25:49.600 --> 25:56.200]  had 54 votes and that's what CNN used to be specific showing Ron Paul with zero
[25:56.200 --> 26:00.400]  when their own CNN poll that we have video of in a screenshot showing winning
[26:00.400 --> 26:05.880]  by 79 that is how desperate the system is starting to get right now the
[26:05.880 --> 26:13.200]  headline video CNN disinfo refuses to use own poll Ron Paul win at 79% reports
[26:13.200 --> 26:17.800]  zero I mean whether you like Ron Paul or not I happen to love him this is the
[26:17.800 --> 26:21.920]  deception we're talking about this is what the mainstream media does and
[26:21.920 --> 26:27.000]  that's why the mainstream media more and more is not the mainstream media in
[26:27.000 --> 26:33.200]  fact it's a paper tiger the top shows on MSNBC might have a million most their
[26:33.200 --> 26:37.840]  shows have 300 400,000 that's a joke ladies and gentlemen mainline talk
[26:37.840 --> 26:42.240]  radio in big cities like New York or LA the top radio shows that are only on in
[26:42.240 --> 26:46.720]  those cities can have upwards of a half million listeners conservatively in an
[26:46.720 --> 26:51.760]  hour and they're a couple hundred bucks 300 bucks 400 bucks for a one-minute ad
[26:51.760 --> 26:57.480]  and then meanwhile the same one-minute ad on MSNBC's 10 15 20,000 again it's all
[26:57.480 --> 27:03.560]  a fraud it's a scam it's a total and complete joke all right I'm starting to
[27:03.560 --> 27:08.920]  rant on that issue instead of finishing up with the whole TSA situation you know
[27:08.920 --> 27:13.120]  at the end of that report that we just played it has a few clips from a TSA
[27:13.120 --> 27:17.000]  video press release about six months ago admitting that they're going to be at
[27:17.000 --> 27:22.040]  malls and shopping centers and grocery stores and if they are at bus stations
[27:22.040 --> 27:27.800]  and train stations you just pull up at the bus station in New Jersey or Texas or
[27:27.800 --> 27:32.320]  Florida it's happened everywhere California and the TSA leads you and your
[27:32.320 --> 27:39.040]  family into a room and does the groping there and now they're running this three
[27:39.040 --> 27:43.200]  state exercise they run four state exercises before where they're setting
[27:43.200 --> 27:46.800]  up checkpoints and have aircraft down a surveilling people they're calling it a
[27:46.800 --> 27:51.400]  drill but during these drills in the past they actually search people so
[27:51.400 --> 27:56.280]  there's the report TSA security exercise covers three states five thousand
[27:56.280 --> 28:04.560]  miles centering in around Kentucky West Virginia and one other states that's
[28:04.560 --> 28:09.360]  being reported on by multiple newspapers and we have links to it continuing
[28:09.360 --> 28:15.480]  along that line of news I have a report here out of CNS news if you're hearing
[28:15.480 --> 28:19.280]  this for the first time this is not only in CNS news in fact it's not just the
[28:19.280 --> 28:25.960]  head of the union calling for it this is what Homeland Security has said they're
[28:25.960 --> 28:32.280]  going to do first select but then all postal service vehicles are going to
[28:32.280 --> 28:36.520]  have NSA snooping mast on them similar to what Google got caught and
[28:36.520 --> 28:41.000]  criminally charged within Europe last year with their own little Google cars
[28:41.000 --> 28:45.800]  with by the way Google is really NSA CIA that's come out Google was founded with
[28:45.800 --> 28:50.920]  NSA CIA and you tell money don't believe me just type in Google founded with CIA
[28:50.920 --> 28:55.960]  money and you'll get associated press telling you how great it is but union
[28:55.960 --> 29:02.440]  wants mailmen to thwart terror attacks CNS news and CNS news has a clip courtesy
[29:02.440 --> 29:08.200]  CNN with the head of their union for the biggest group of federal workers out
[29:08.200 --> 29:12.640]  there biggest one single group to that they're going to be secret agents spying
[29:12.640 --> 29:18.880]  on you and driving around with the mast that pick things up and of course they
[29:18.880 --> 29:23.080]  push in these reports oh it's to pick up chemical or biological traces but also
[29:23.080 --> 29:27.880]  be picking up digital data so driving around just vacuum-cleanering up
[29:27.880 --> 29:32.880]  everything that they might be missing when your communications run over the
[29:32.880 --> 29:37.800]  big telecoms where the NSA is admittedly firmly ensconced and it's come out all
[29:37.800 --> 29:41.920]  over the country that one of the main groups is cable guys when they're in
[29:41.920 --> 29:46.400]  your house they're spying on you but the cable box itself is spying on you I mean
[29:46.400 --> 29:53.120]  where does it end it's beyond 1984 stay with us we're on the march the empires on
[29:53.120 --> 29:59.240]  the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[34:40.240 --> 34:45.920]  have joining us from Pakistan retired Pakistani three-star general known for
[34:45.920 --> 34:50.160]  heading the inner services intelligence and leading the directing the war out of
[34:50.160 --> 34:55.600]  Pakistan in Afghanistan against the Soviet occupation that came after their
[34:55.600 --> 35:02.240]  invasion and also serving advising Benazir Budo and other prime ministers
[35:02.240 --> 35:08.680]  general Hamed ghoul general Hamed ghoul.com is the website and of course
[35:08.680 --> 35:13.120]  you see him on CNN Fox you see him all over BBC globally I wanted to get him on
[35:13.120 --> 35:17.440]  today to talk about the deteriorating relationship between Pakistan and the
[35:17.440 --> 35:21.760]  United States that he predicted here last year and earlier this year and to
[35:21.760 --> 35:27.360]  talk about the CNN report CIA safehouse owner in bin Laden raid arrested
[35:27.360 --> 35:32.960]  headlines CIA assets arrested the Wall Street Journal reports inside Pakistan
[35:32.960 --> 35:36.800]  the Pentagon now saying on a scale of one to ten the relationship is deteriorated
[35:36.800 --> 35:41.840]  from a seven to a three with Pakistan more drone strikes killing more people
[35:41.840 --> 35:46.160]  months after Pakistan ordered the drones out Yemen has ordered them out bombing
[35:46.160 --> 35:50.280]  intensifying this violates international law but it's a huge
[35:50.280 --> 35:55.280]  escalation general ghoul a lot has happened thank you for joining us thank
[35:55.280 --> 35:59.920]  you are available to you anytime you want me well thank you a general ghoul
[35:59.920 --> 36:03.360]  what's most important in all the big developments that are unfolding am I
[36:03.360 --> 36:08.240]  accurate in saying that tensions are escalating in a frightening way yes
[36:08.240 --> 36:12.680]  indeed they are and at a very critical time when America is about to start to
[36:12.680 --> 36:19.040]  join troops from up on top and Pakistan is the only relief loan they have and I
[36:19.040 --> 36:23.960]  don't know why they were help and don't destabilizing Pakistan it can't be in
[36:23.960 --> 36:29.960]  America's interest then who's interested is it serving I think the fears of
[36:29.960 --> 36:36.360]  Israel and the ambitions of India these are not driving the American policies
[36:36.360 --> 36:40.800]  unfortunately and I think this is going to hurt the American people in the long
[36:40.800 --> 36:49.120]  term so I in order to satisfy other nations other who have always been like
[36:49.120 --> 36:56.360]  parasites they have been feeding on on the American goodwill these countries
[36:56.360 --> 37:02.320]  the interest must not override the American public interest American
[37:02.320 --> 37:06.680]  national interest but unfortunately this is exactly what is what is happening
[37:06.680 --> 37:15.320]  right now and as far as the relationship between CIA and the ISI are
[37:15.320 --> 37:21.240]  concerned they are pivotal to any kind of safe exit for America out of the
[37:21.240 --> 37:26.760]  region and whatever instance America wishes to retain because it is going to
[37:26.760 --> 37:31.520]  create a lot of problem and I think the important thing is that even a man like
[37:31.520 --> 37:37.160]  Henry Kissinger came out very strongly that please do not insult the Pakistan
[37:37.160 --> 37:44.680]  do not destabilize Pakistan because the more you do that the more America will
[37:44.680 --> 37:50.200]  distance itself from Pakistan and Pakistan will get closer to China and it
[37:50.200 --> 37:57.120]  will indirectly get closer to Russia as well well general goal of effort for new
[37:57.120 --> 38:01.840]  listeners who don't understand the geopolitical makeup the United States
[38:01.840 --> 38:08.080]  is beginning a supposed build down as they call it in Orwellian terms from
[38:08.080 --> 38:12.200]  Afghanistan but even the Pentagon yesterday said that their whole strategy
[38:12.200 --> 38:19.400]  is quote you know shifting towards Pakistan towards the east towards your
[38:19.400 --> 38:24.840]  border and the drone attacks are intensifying and and now we've seen
[38:24.840 --> 38:30.320]  these are rest inside Pakistan what is the information you're getting the
[38:30.320 --> 38:33.800]  intelligence you're getting with your connections in the Pakistani army and
[38:33.800 --> 38:40.800]  intelligence what are these are rest of supposed CIA moles who were involved
[38:40.800 --> 38:47.960]  getting intelligence on the on the bin Laden reported raid it's not only that
[38:47.960 --> 38:52.680]  Alex I think the whole lot of picture has to be understood in its broader
[38:52.680 --> 38:57.960]  perspective I think right from the beginning and I was one I think in one
[38:57.960 --> 39:04.360]  of the shows I had said this also that 9-11 was nearly a pretext it was the
[39:04.360 --> 39:12.240]  inside job and it was the pretext to go globally for capturing the in the
[39:12.240 --> 39:17.960]  territory or the strategic concept of the American general from you know that
[39:17.960 --> 39:23.600]  the air brains although it may be but that was one objective the other was to
[39:23.600 --> 39:29.520]  create space for the corporate America that it was to contain China and the
[39:29.520 --> 39:36.000]  other was that the immediate excuse was that they have to demolish the Taliban
[39:36.000 --> 39:40.600]  regime in Afghanistan today a report has been published in the main reason was
[39:40.600 --> 39:46.640]  women's right today a United Nations report has been published and amazingly
[39:46.640 --> 39:54.200]  it says that Afghanistan leads the list in the entire world into the Congo
[39:54.200 --> 39:59.920]  etc. it is where the women rights are being trampled upon that that means it
[39:59.920 --> 40:05.320]  has not had any effect whatsoever as far as Al Qaeda is concerned Taliban had
[40:05.320 --> 40:11.600]  distanced themselves from Al Qaeda a long time back so what was the objective
[40:11.600 --> 40:16.360]  really it was not to function I think a lot of people here including me we thought
[40:16.360 --> 40:22.920]  that Pakistan was a target because Pakistan is nuclear Pakistan has a very
[40:22.920 --> 40:28.480]  large army very good army Pakistan is self-sufficient in food it's not like
[40:28.480 --> 40:33.360]  North Korea it is not like Iran so Pakistan can stand on its feet and
[40:33.360 --> 40:40.400]  Pakistan has China at its back and they were to this entire adventure was to
[40:40.400 --> 40:46.400]  support I'm the Indian had you any over the region eventually which is not
[40:46.400 --> 40:50.480]  working because the Americans lives have been lost in these two or more than
[40:50.480 --> 40:55.920]  6,000 Americans have been lost and I think four times as many have been
[40:55.920 --> 41:01.760]  injured and a lot of them have become cycle psychological casualties which is
[41:01.760 --> 41:06.720]  incalculable because no figures have been put out we're speaking with General
[41:06.720 --> 41:11.640]  Hamid Ghul specifically though from the last time we talked to you a little over
[41:11.640 --> 41:16.880]  a month ago has the situation gotten better or is it deteriorating on a
[41:16.880 --> 41:22.840]  faster pace and you say you can't figure out what the what these national
[41:22.840 --> 41:27.440]  interest for the US is you say there's an interest for Israel or India what
[41:27.440 --> 41:33.200]  interest do those countries have in destabilizing the region I don't know
[41:33.200 --> 41:37.400]  India really wants to reach out to Central Asia and they have to be able to
[41:37.400 --> 41:42.840]  sort of forget goodwill of Pakistan for that because Pakistan is landlocked
[41:42.840 --> 41:48.440]  Central Asia landlocked and you can reach only through Pakistan so instead of
[41:48.440 --> 41:53.200]  bashing Pakistan the way it is being passed it is important that you settle
[41:53.200 --> 41:59.280]  the dispute which is a bond of four of discord in a relationship between India
[41:59.280 --> 42:03.720]  and Pakistan over the past six to three years and all the Christians are
[42:03.720 --> 42:07.880]  wanting is the right to vote which is at the pinnacle of the edifice of
[42:07.880 --> 42:12.760]  democracy so why don't the Americans and Indians who claims so much that they
[42:12.760 --> 42:16.840]  are beholden to democracy why don't they give them this right to vote this is one
[42:16.840 --> 42:21.080]  issue which need to be settled as far as Israel is concerned because it is an
[42:21.080 --> 42:25.920]  artificial state and they fear that they have a short shelf life this is very
[42:25.920 --> 42:30.680]  unfortunate though it is not so but this is what they believe it is because
[42:30.680 --> 42:36.360]  their own religious prediction in the past in their scripture they say a few
[42:36.360 --> 42:41.400]  things and they it invokes fear in them and they think as long as Pakistan is
[42:41.400 --> 42:48.680]  nuclear capable one day India Israel may taste the wrath of Pakistan or the
[42:48.680 --> 42:53.640]  Muslim world but you see here is a point that you have to understand
[42:53.640 --> 42:59.360]  Netanyahu was made a very good offer by President Obama then let's go back to
[42:59.360 --> 43:06.240]  1967 border and it was not anything to be accepted by these Palestinians but
[43:06.240 --> 43:13.200]  still I think it was a reasonable formula very very wise or suggestion but
[43:13.200 --> 43:18.880]  the way Netanyahu turned it down and he insulted the President of America in a
[43:18.880 --> 43:24.600]  way but when he was received in the Congress there was such a innovation
[43:24.600 --> 43:32.560]  there on every word that they would jump up in congressmen men and women and it
[43:32.560 --> 43:35.880]  was a puppet show it appeared like that he was a puppet here and there were
[43:35.880 --> 43:42.360]  puppets in front of him who were coming up and down I mean if a small state like
[43:42.360 --> 43:48.120]  Israel was to steer the policies of America and its destiny indeed because
[43:48.120 --> 43:54.360]  that is where the destiny lies so I can only lament the policy vectors in America
[43:54.360 --> 43:59.200]  well General Gull looking at at at India's reasons I mean you're saying
[43:59.200 --> 44:02.920]  they want to expand in the region why not just engage in business and trade I
[44:02.920 --> 44:07.280]  guess they're still angry about the whole cashmere war but now going back a
[44:07.280 --> 44:13.760]  few weeks ago to the attacks on the Pakistani military bases by supposed
[44:13.760 --> 44:18.920]  militants we have the CIA agent arrested a few months ago reportedly trying to
[44:18.920 --> 44:25.800]  give chemical biological radiologicals to quote Taliban as a way to frame the
[44:25.800 --> 44:33.120]  government as leaking these materials I mean specifically the Pakistani news
[44:33.120 --> 44:37.400]  is starting to report that that that Western intelligence is trying to
[44:37.400 --> 44:43.320]  foment al-Qaeda type activities to then connect it to the Pakistani government
[44:43.320 --> 44:48.160]  what can you say to that what can you say to major newspapers with no evidence
[44:48.160 --> 44:52.920]  that claim that you might really be the leader of al-Qaeda I mean I know you've
[44:52.920 --> 44:56.240]  seen those quotes what do you make of those statements
[44:56.240 --> 45:25.440]  libelical nonsense they are trying to find scapegoats because they fail so miserably the American general and the American and the Western intelligence services they have failed their own people more than anyone else so they are trying to find the scapegoats they will come out with the evidence I am here available I have said that okay I'm prepared to travel to America in fact I applied for renewal of my visa on 6th of May
[45:25.440 --> 45:48.600]  2001 before the 9-11 happened and they said that we let you know in three weeks time I have a written letter from the US Embassy here and those three weeks have not expired so far similarly UK banned my entry in 2000 and I wrote to them look if I am wanted by you if I am a security
[45:48.600 --> 45:59.840]  has it for you why don't you hold me up why don't you interrogate me why don't you send your own undercover officers to come and talk to me if you have any doubt that is question why would you talk to me
[45:59.840 --> 46:07.360]  in fact you said earlier in the year here that you're ready to get on a plane and come and testify before Congress right now so if you are
[46:07.360 --> 46:31.360]  exactly I am prepared to do that but they will not have because they don't want to listen to the truth they know that I will speak in their medium I have worked with them I worked with the CIA we do a very good job I have lots of friends I hold nothing against the American people in fact I pity them because they are so gullible they are so innocent they are very easily taken for a ride and then
[46:31.360 --> 46:54.360]  the latest Alex what has happened is that my grandson the son of my daughter he won the full bright scholarship in his own right he stood first in Pakistan and he received the letter of conversion from a person who has been President Obama himself and but when he applied for visa not only the homeless security
[46:54.360 --> 47:18.360]  denied him the visa but they asked the people who were concerned with the full bright scholarship to cancel his scholarship what problem I just don't understand I think they are being very unreasonable and this is how they make people who are their legitimate friends they turn them into hostile entities against them
[47:18.360 --> 47:40.360]  certainly so you have family that has these prestigious scholarships and our government or homeland security that sees and control the states is saying hey I don't even let them have that scholarship when you were a guy in the 80s and early 90s they talked about how great you were in our news and just because you are against these wars you are against these drone attacks on your country you are a bad guy
[47:40.360 --> 47:54.360]  and Yemen that has been the supposed ally of the US has stopped the drone attacks you are stirring up the country and they say we are not going to stop I mean how can the people running this government just randomly have drones flying around killing whoever they want
[47:54.360 --> 48:11.360]  I mean it's exactly more than 2500 people have been killed in drone attacks and it has invoked the revenge sentiment in the 50s and they have really given a blood wash to citizens and bazaars of Pakistan no less than 35,000 people have been killed in this
[48:11.360 --> 48:36.360]  5000 Pakistani soldiers have lost their lives in America this futile war which is not going to bring any result America is spending in Afghanistan today 113 billion dollars can you believe it it is nearly 2.2 billion dollars a week
[48:36.360 --> 48:52.360]  and that's why they want to keep the war going people say what's the point of the war it's about the war profiteering the opium controlling who can build gas pipelines and oil pipelines through the region it's for multinational corporations
[48:52.360 --> 49:14.360]  it's bankrupting America we pay for it we get nothing out of it and the good news is the head of the speaker of the house Boehner has come out and given Obama until Friday to specifically say what's really going on in Libya and I've got some intel that US troops are preparing from Fort Hood to deploy in the next month to Libya
[49:14.360 --> 49:34.360]  so this is appearing to become more than just a regional war but a wider war general ghoul in closing if thing go ahead this is insanity I tell you please people of America a lot of them I know millions of people are listening to you now please tell them this is bad
[49:34.360 --> 49:53.360]  we are your friend we have stuck to your heels over so many years we have been through the era of Cold War we brought down the Soviet breadman as it used to be called from John Pastor Dulles till today Pakistan has paid a huge price
[49:53.360 --> 50:09.360]  but America has every time betrayed us now look at this case of for them and Davis and a parallel spy network they set up it is a treason for a Pakistani and in any country the law is that it is a treason to be spying for somebody else
[50:09.360 --> 50:29.360]  but here are Pakistanis who have been holed up and now Americans according to the New York Times report they are very disturbed about it why could they be disturbed if it happens in America what would be their response why are they being so unfair and unjust to a country which has been a long term ally
[50:29.360 --> 50:47.360]  and whom you need the American people need this country I can assure you you need our support I am a strategist and I understand all these things and I am a friend of America I am not the enemy I am critical of their policies as many of you are within America so there is nothing wrong
[50:47.360 --> 51:00.360]  but the way they give me the game is I have just told you how well general go hold on hold on let's finish up briefly after the break I want you to finish this key thought on the other side then we'll go to your phone calls and a lot of other news stay with us

[54:24.360 --> 54:35.360]  we have the head of the speaker of the house the head of the house giving obama until friday deadline on libya and now breaking lawmakers sue obama over libya
[54:35.360 --> 54:47.360]  i buy partisan group of house members announced today that it's filing a lawsuit charging that obama made an illegal in run around congress he said i did it under you and authority and didn't even consult congress again
[54:47.360 --> 55:01.360]  this is against america's interest to go in and make an enemy of pakistan when they told us months ago get your drones out and it continues they want to set up a war with pakistan who's got nuclear weapons and china has said they'll come in
[55:01.360 --> 55:11.360]  this is not in our interest to trigger world war three but these globalists are going to sit it out in europe all this happens who got most of the bailout money european private families
[55:11.360 --> 55:18.360]  they will they hate america and they're going to use the war to do it general gul do you agree with that strategic basic statement i just made
[55:18.360 --> 55:28.360]  yes absolutely 100 percent a little more i think this will be a disgrace if america were to be defeated at the end of taliban
[55:28.360 --> 55:37.360]  can you imagine that these nameless faceless people individual band groups they are non state actors they are going to defeat america
[55:37.360 --> 55:45.360]  i think we have to negotiate you have to accept that you made a mistake you came at a right wrong time in a wrong place against the wrong people
[55:45.360 --> 55:54.360]  they were not al-qaeda they were not against america and pakistan's trying to give us an exit so declare victory ten years later and leave
[55:54.360 --> 56:07.360]  yes they have no because they have found an excuse in the habit of our trade it was a fake but it doesn't matter we'll accept this ok that is your victory you have achieved your target to go out for heaven's sake
[56:07.360 --> 56:20.360]  leave us alone and attend to your own domestic problems obama should now appear like a president of peace rather than another president of war that america is unfortunately suffering
[56:20.360 --> 56:31.360]  now general you just alluded to the bin laden raid and i said you weren't sure early on you've now researched it what is your view on the bin laden raid
[56:31.360 --> 56:51.360]  i believe that your wife and children were living there and he wasn't there he had died a long time back but there was an understanding between our intelligence and pakistan intelligence and the american intelligence that we will at an appropriate time in order to declare victory
[56:51.360 --> 57:02.360]  and to build a pretext for withdrawing from afghanistan we will carry out an operation but towards the end leon penata decided to take the credit for himself all by himself
[57:02.360 --> 57:14.360]  and i think this man is very dangerous you've got to be careful this man is a disaster the outgoing defense secretary robert gates was more sensible he was more mature
[57:14.360 --> 57:27.360]  but this man wants to take credit and on the other hand the new ciet is david pittis has got agenda of his own it is this private agenda which he is pursuing
[57:27.360 --> 57:30.360]  so you have to be very careful how things go for the future
[57:30.360 --> 57:47.360]  general gul in closing you have intel sources are just from talking to the other sources you're saying now that it was fake pakistani intelligence went along with the fraud as a pretext to give the u.s. a fake victory and an exit strategy
[57:47.360 --> 58:03.360]  yes i do this is not there everyone knows there and i am a little more informed than the others but this is what the real story is and i think a lot of people across the world don't believe what the americans are saying
[58:03.360 --> 58:17.360]  if you were to believe president obama you would listen to his first statement which said that he was the troops were resisted there the navy seals were resisted but second statement that he was unarmed
[58:17.360 --> 58:26.360]  he was killed if at all you have to question in front of his wives and children and he was unarmed he was putting up no resistance
[58:26.360 --> 58:34.360]  if he's the big i mean if he's been lied to you wanting murder i mean he is not a murder and who is guilty to have ordered that murder
[58:34.360 --> 58:43.360]  all right general gul let me say bye teeter in the break thank you so much for spending so much time with us we'll be right back

[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:22.360]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:35.360]  well if you just joined us we had general hami gul former head of pakistani intelligence on and on and off air he confirmed that yes quote everybody knows in pakistani intelligence
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:45.360]  now he's got the full scoop that it was a staged event but he said go ahead go with the official story you killed bin laden now you can leave
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:56.360]  okay we don't want world war three to start and i agree with that statement and the financial times of london many other strategist even the secretary of defense agrees it's time to go
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:08.360]  it was time to go a long time ago but i hear neocon radio always saying you know you're anti america you're running up the white flag alexander the great had to pull out of pakistan and afghanistan
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:18.360]  nobody has ever dominated that place they're not going to give up it's not going to happen and there's nothing to give up to i mean it's insane
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:28.360]  but did you hear him saying that the word is quote everybody in pakistani intelligence he's got the sources i said specifically your sources he said yes all of them
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:43.360]  that he was already dead bin laden's got a bunch of wives there was one group there and they had decided to do the right a long time ago as a quote fake victory as a pretext for the west to have its exit strategy
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:51.360]  but the word is this is even come out mainstream u.s. news that there are elements of the pentagon elements of foreign interest lobbying
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:02:00.360]  the israelan others that want to keep the united states in the region and so they're going to try to have this certain elements of the cia
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:15.360]  get radiological chemical biological mbc's to al qaeda slash l cia to connections as a pretext and then say oh look the nuclear components are getting out we've got to invade
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:23.360]  open talk about that and china is saying they may go absolutely eight of this happens and you've got china
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:33.360]  you've got the iranians the russians all getting together the pakistanis pakistanis were ally this is not good
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:41.360]  and and and everything our government's doing is destroying our goodwill worldwide it's destroying our real national interest it's destabilizing
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:53.360]  well the global banksters their interest are not our interest they don't want a stable world they can play the different arms of society off against each other
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:03:03.360]  they can play the different regions off against each other and then create global crises that the big megabanks make profits out of just like the old
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:12.360]  famous european banks the rothschilds and others funding all sides sometimes there were multiple sides in a war not just two sides but different sub factions
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:21.360]  funding all the different sides and everybody goes into deeper debt it gives the banksters and the austerity moves political cover because people tend to do what their politicians say
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:30.360]  during a new war we've been predicting for years as the economic implosion becomes evident that wars would be started and now it's happening all over
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:40.360]  that's how world war one that's how world war two started that's how much of the cold war was fought through proxies but now it's the global private banking cartels
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:52.360]  playing sovereign nations off against each other for not either side to win anything but to destroy the nation state there is a war against the nation state going on
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:04:01.360]  there is a war against the republic anything the globalists are for i'm against there for gun control i'm against it there i'm against them disarming the citizens worldwide
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:09.360]  as they're trying to do through this un treaty that unidire has they brought back up for the umpteenth time the news is now reporting on
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:17.360]  i am against the borders being wide open in the north american union that they now admit with wiki leaks documents is in place
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:25.360]  the globalists are for i'm against it there for all these wars i'm against it and then you go in and geopolitically look at is it in our interest
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:34.360]  not not as an even moral well let's just set that aside but when you get past all the chinese flags made in china american flags made in china

[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:31.360]  okay folks thank you for joining us we are now eight minutes and 15 seconds into our number two coming up about 25 minutes doctor of history also an economist wedgster riffin tarpley is going to join us on all the big economic news that's coming out here some of it stocks fall over 1%
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:53.360]  amid eurozone worries after stocks dropped for what several weeks straight they finally went back up a little bit earlier in the week but have dropped down again unfortunately and we have the chinese government coming out and say the united states is already defaulted by inflating the currency that is what's going on
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:09:10.360]  we have the financial times of london today reporting the global order fractures as america power declines we have been maneuvered into this position by mega global corporations dominated by the private central banking complex that do not have the united states
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:30.360]  interested hard and openly put out policy reports calling for global conflict not so america wins or pakistan wins or china wins or england wins but so that this global order so globalism can be expanded and very serious developments
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:43.360]  we're not going to your phone calls but here's some of the news we're going to be covering with doctor tarpley coming up lawmakers to obama over libya and absolutely even if this libya war was just and it's not
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:56.360]  turns out qaddafi didn't run to venezuela he doesn't have rape teams with the viagra the state departments admitted i mean look how ridiculous that is that's like things to dom was killing babies that were in incubators it's admitted that that wasn't true
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:08.360]  these are things that are meant to sell the war it's about trillions in oil it's about having a new war for the european union to expand their control along with african and the pentagon into africa
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:31.360]  and qaddafi made deals he gave up his wmds just like the pro-us dictator hazy mubarak was betrayed they've put a new dictatorship of the military coup in they've arrested 7000 dissidents they've banned protest period it's worse than under mubarak and our media suddenly isn't telling us that there needs to be a new revolution
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:46.360]  who runs our media these are corporate interests that want to destabilize the middle east and it's happening everywhere but finally three plus months into this congress is saying you didn't even consult congress it's a violation of the constitution the war powers act
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:11:05.360]  congress says i have u n authority to do this wow that is treason by every historical measurement to say i did this for the credibility of the u n in a speech and a statement that's my authority is the united nations well then why even have a congress
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:18.360]  the feds are always telling us the states have no rights why do we even have states then it's the same thing it's a power grab the people running america want to run it into the ground they hate anybody who's free and independent
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:30.360]  they hate the iraqis they hate the libyans they hate the pakistanis they hate the swiss the globalist are always trying to get rid of sovereign nations are the swiss good yeah they got a lot of freedom good folks i like them
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:40.360]  is mu market off he good no i don't like him i don't like dictators i don't like big government the point is he's not a globalist that's why he's being removed is removing him good no
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:52.360]  it's being done for the wrong reason same thing with mumbaric do i like a dictator no but he was our dictator but see he wasn't he was the globalist dictator and look at how they betray him they'll betray us as well
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:12:03.360]  let me go along with this police state and banners coming out saying obama's got until friday they're gonna cut the funding start hearings lawsuits have started political reports talk of impeachment
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:16.360]  representative walter jones republican leading the charge ron paul involved this is big okay because look at obama can do this i didn't like the iraq war but bush went to congress and got the authorization
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:30.360]  why did bush do that because he was supposed to okay this is a big deal this is a big deal akhmed denigy joins china russia leaders at summit to talk about what the u.s. is doing i'm not saying akhmed denigy is a good guy
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:40.360]  but all the things our government is doing is making all these countries the iranians never liked the russians the pakistanis have always hated the russians they're all getting together now
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:50.360]  now why do the globalists that run our country why do they want this what's the financial times of london say the whole world's turning against us this is a setup ladies and gentlemen
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:13:00.360]  continuing here vietnam shift could see return of u.s. ships chinese threatening financial times of london now now we're teaming up with the vietnamese our supposed enemy
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:11.360]  china rebukes u.s. over south china sea disputes ap russia's freaking out over u.s. warships in the black sea saying it's a provocation
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:26.360]  u.s. naval movements around syria hezbollah moves rockets i mean this is all the type of jockeying you see before a world war everybody's lining up choosing sides and it's not in our interest
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:36.360]  okay let's go to your phone calls let's talk to doug in virginia doug thanks for holding welcome thank you and thank you for all the work that you've done for this country
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:46.360]  i want to talk about the tsa yes sir i'd like to see the tsa abolished but if not i think we need to fight bureaucracy with bureaucracy
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:14:00.360]  we can do that by having the profession of a tsa screener or passenger screener regulated not by state tsa but by the department of professional regulation like a doctor lawyer plumber electrician or barber
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:10.360]  so that all tsa agents would have to be licensed bonded and insured with standards as to who can serve training so they recognize medical devices implants
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:20.360]  well that's another issue the tsa and their federal rollout on the streets is commanding the military that's in the news today at checkpoints and police
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:32.360]  you've got military under command hundreds of years of history spree decor you've got the police bonded trained sworn that's why they won't stick their hands down your pants because they know it's illegal without a warrant
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:42.360]  that's why they disdain the tsa and you've got these these these these people look it's against the law for them to not do radiation testing every month on the scanners
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:50.360]  they just do it it's against the law for them to stick their hands down your pants they just do it i've had district attorneys on that's the whole point it's a total power grab
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:15:00.360]  it's against the law to have them out of their jurisdiction on highways and at school proms but but you're absolutely right we need to there's more than one way to skin a cat
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:07.360]  and by the way i've got to say this and go back to your dog every time i fly now it makes me actually feel guilty and it's it's very weird
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:14.360]  but i flew to new york this weekend and flew back through austin and it makes me feel very strange because i know what the tsa is doing wrong
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:23.360]  i know they've got a lot of thugs and goons but they asked for my autograph they say their fans the manager came over at austin and said i'm a fan of your show a lot of us agree with you
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:33.360]  we don't like doing this and i'm like you're telling me this in the concourse can't you get in trouble so so i want to be clear same thing happened in new jersey
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:40.360]  a lot of these people are good people who need the job and and don't like doing and i'm not saying it's okay what they're doing
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:50.360]  but we got a lot of friends at the tsa and they say we want real union power we don't want to be doing this we want a profile i'm sorry go ahead
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:16:02.360]  if they were licensed by the state then there's the ability to find them or prohibit their action or even revoke their license so that they can still be employed by the tsa
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:11.360]  but they can't screen the same way as a doctor can work for the VA but if he engages in malpractice as defined by the state he can't practice methods
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:24.360]  but that's the thing everybody else a lawyer a police officer a FBI agent a plumber everybody's under this licensing system and laws passed at the state level for regulation
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:34.360]  and federal that's why the state house in texas keeps asking the feds where is your code where is your law where do you get this authority it's like the FBI Monday announces in their new handbook
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:44.360]  they don't need warrants to break in your house to dig through your trash to wiretap you well i mean can the tsa write up new policies saying they can do
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:54.360]  you know proctology exams great points dug what do you think in closing of the latest that they're expanding more highway checkpoints with the army
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:59.360]  bad news but again it's up to the states to assert their authority
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:05.360]  you said it dug your and texas tried the house pasted 138 to zip
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:15.360]  david dohurst a former CIA guy killed it tried to cover it up under political pressure reintroduced it in special session got a few weeks left in it
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:24.360]  sent it to rick perry only the governor can add a bill to special session and rick perry has refused so far and i'm gonna do some more reporting on rick perry soon
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:31.360]  i told you was gonna run for president i told you three and a half years ago an end game and he's always pledged i'll never run i love texas
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:40.360]  he said a month ago i'm not gonna run suddenly maybe i'll run folks he's got the book out he's traveling he's he's getting ready he's gonna run
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:49.360]  okay and by the way we got all the dirt on rick perry i'm just up at the edge of that cliff right now wondering how far i want to go with this
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:57.360]  and i want to cross some t's dot some i's let's go to mike and texas thanks for holding mike you're on the air
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:04.360]  hey alex hey buddy go ahead hey man i've talked to you a couple times before i'm the telecom engineer out here

[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:25.360]  this goes back to the theme that you always talk okay your phone was breaking up a bit go ahead
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:35.360]  yeah his phone was just doing all sorts of stuff yeah it's it's it's it's all over the news right now that the telecoms are spying on everything you do
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:47.360]  that google five years ago put a press release out saying with the onboard microphones and cameras on laptops and computers we're listening to you for advertising data
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:57.360]  and if we hear a dog barking then a ad will pop up on sites you visit via the cookies that advertises dog food that was one of the examples
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:05.360]  and they said we'll listen to what sitcoms you listen to and then put ads up for paraphernalia associated with the sitcom and we wrote an article about it
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:12.360]  people couldn't believe it even though it was a link to a press release they put out stockholders and hope that caller can get back through because
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:19.360]  I want to hear what you had to say now here is google in the news today now they're getting ready to announce it to the general public the San Jose Mercury
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:30.360]  news google aims to speed up the web with instant pages and spoken search so soon you'll just talk to your computer and they already have iphone apps that do this
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:43.360]  and google says don't worry people aren't listening so it's okay no NSA software given to google twelve years ago is and it's all based on that keyword scans
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:50.360]  and so there it is where they just calmly announced like it's no big deal oh guess what you're gonna talk to your computer now

[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:38.360]  very dangerous time and this always happens in history before huge wars most people aren't aware of it they're not paying attention
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:46.360]  there's a recession there's a depression and then boom it starts and it's off to the races and it always starts with smaller regional conflicts
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:50.360]  we're going to be talking about that coming up in the next segment let's continue with your calls
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:54.360]  let's talk to Janice in Texas Janice you're on the air
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:25:04.360]  Hi Alex I have two points I'd like to make and I have to write them down so I'm sorry if I sound like a robot
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:17.360]  first I wanted to congratulate you on a true victory on I think it was like two Fridays ago with the MI6 BBC smug creeps like staring you down
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:28.360]  and I just wanted to say that Steve Pechenick was your ex caliber and Bob Chapman was your champion it was a true Camelot moment
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:36.360]  I mean their mouths must have been on the floor with that kind of information and I hope they had their tail between their legs
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:44.360]  well that guy does hit pieces on patriots so he's particularly nasty so that's why we went after him I said go ahead and come on in
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:51.360]  but we're not going to be nice to you we're not going to play friendly and act like we don't know exactly what you're up to go ahead
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:59.360]  your listeners that day were the ones that did the dance of victory so he can put that in his pipe and smoke it
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:10.360]  but okay number two a couple of callers I mean I listen every day and have since you're on public access
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:18.360]  but a couple of callers called in one time with Jill Flante on and one time with Porter Stansberry
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:26.360]  and you know you've got the buy gold buy silver but then you've got a lot of listeners who just don't have the money
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:31.360]  you know I mean they're broke as a pig in a poke they just don't have the money
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:38.360]  and no I understand but I mean silver ten years ago was five dollars an ounce now it's almost up to forty again
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:44.360]  and so the issue is you know you buy a silver dollar for five dollars ten years ago now it's worth forty
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:53.360]  and so even the people that have almost no money can get into silver and you know that's why I've been such a big promoter of silver
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:57.360]  it's not that silver's gone up it's that the dollar's gone down in value
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:02.360]  I have money I would definitely do that I'm not saying that's a bad idea I'm just
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:07.360]  well look I think your health is more important than even money that's why we promote trying to eat organic
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:12.360]  trying to get healthy and myself included it's a very unhealthy world out there right now
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:19.360]  I think that comes first. That's what Gerald Salente's answer was break the chain don't buy junk
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:27.360]  don't go to Walmart don't don't buy all that just you know there are still garage sales thank God for now
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:34.360]  and you know other like thrift stores where you can buy all kinds of things absolutely all of us are buying things
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:40.360]  we don't need and it's important to try to support local businesses I appreciate your call Janice Adam in Alabama
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:47.360]  on the air go ahead. Hey thanks for taking my call Alex. Welcome. I wanted to say two things real quick
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:54.360]  I'll try not to take up too much time. That's okay we won't hear from you. Okay the first thing is with the debate
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:28:01.360]  and the CNN you know destroying that poll to make it look like Ron Paul's a zero
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:08.360]  I think we you know should use a Google bomb towards that if you will just like we did
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:14.360]  where you did we all did with the CPAC conference how they used the last year's footage how Fox did that
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:20.360]  and had to come back and redact it I think that the yeah for folks that don't know Ron Paul the last two years in a row
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:26.360]  has won the coveted CPAC and and Ronald Reagan of course won it usually the person that wins CPAC ends up becoming
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:33.360]  the Republican nominee in fact in almost every case and Ron Paul got a standing ovation last year
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:41.360]  and CPAC ran booing over him they ran another clip from a year before that was also staged
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:47.360]  with a few people booing but they had the mic in that area as a setup so they re-ran the old footage
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:54.360]  when he won actually it was early this year time flies but it wasn't last year it was this year
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:59.360]  so when he won this year they did that and for those that just joined us and don't know what happened
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:04.360]  it's confirmed we've got it up on infoworks.com and prismbunna.com with the video clips and the screenshots
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:11.360]  CNN took an obscure internet poll with only 54 respondents before they closed it so it looks like it was staged
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:19.360]  from CNBC and ran it that Ron Paul got 0% in the debate two nights ago all the other polls
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:27.360]  showed upwards of 80 or higher than 80 CNN's own polls showed 79% but they didn't run with that poll
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:34.360]  they showed a CNBC poll with 54 votes that no one knows where it came from with Ron Paul was 0
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:39.360]  and didn't tell people that. I know we just want to break there we got Webster Tarpley coming up
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:42.360]  add anything else you want to add?
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:46.360]  Yeah, it'll take a minute can you hold me over?
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:50.360]  No no we've got to go to Tarpley but if you want to hold I'll come back to you we'll be right back stay with us
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:30:00.360]  We're on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:05.360]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:09.360]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:15.360]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:20.360]  that's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:25.360]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:29.360]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:32.360]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:36.360]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:41.360]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind

[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:22.360]  the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system

[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:30.360]  that we've gotten from good police and leaked
[01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:33.360]  where they're demonizing gun owners, conservatives, libertarians
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.360]  returning veterans
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:38.360]  almost their entire police state grid
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:42.360]  is for people you would call flag-waving red-blooded Americans
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:43.360]  and why is that?
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:46.360]  because flag-waving red-blooded Americans that know
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:50.360]  what makes America America are aware of what's happening
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:54.360]  clearly the ruling class that runs this nation
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:56.360]  the offshore private banking families
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:58.360]  on record who got most of the bailout money
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:02.360]  are positioning the US for giant wars
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:05.360]  domestically against the people but also internationally
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:06.360]  against other nations
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:08.360]  and the Financial Times of London
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:12.360]  is reporting the global order fractures as America power declines
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:14.360]  and who's been running America?
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:16.360]  the globalist, globalism
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:18.360]  and so they're waging war against other countries
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:20.360]  but also us here domestically
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:22.360]  it's full spectrum dominance
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:26.360]  and we're going to look at all of the incredible developments
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:29.360]  and political and military realignments
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:34.360]  Vietnam getting closer to the United States
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:37.360]  China and Russia getting closer with Pakistan
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:41.360]  Russia saying get your ships out of the Black Sea, United States
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.360]  all of this saber-rattling
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:46.360]  and it's happening as the economies melt down
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:49.360]  this happens throughout history over and over again
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.360]  in the midst of that you have the Speaker of the House saying
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:55.360]  hey you got till Friday Obama to tell us what's going on with this war
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:56.360]  we're going to cut the funding
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:35:00.360]  we have Congress people filing suit against the federal government
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:04.360]  against the executive branch pointing out that this is illegal
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:07.360]  incredible things are happening right now
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:11.360]  meanwhile we have government corruption at all time highs
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:15.360]  with Obama openly giving healthcare waivers to his campaign donors
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:18.360]  so they don't have to buy insurance for their employees
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:20.360]  total mafia
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:23.360]  just total big city corruption
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:27.360]  where you're exempt from stuff if you give us money
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:29.360]  I mean that is total gangster
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:33.360]  Obama donors, net government jobs, political reports
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:34.360]  totally illegal
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:36.360]  they're now having fundraisers in the White House
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:37.360]  illegal
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:40.360]  one of the reasons Clinton almost got impeached
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:41.360]  they don't care
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:43.360]  the fact is before they hid this stuff
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.360]  now they're out in the open
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:49.360]  just like congressmen in the past it was much more rare to be in sex scandals
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:53.360]  or to be texting photos of their genitals to scores of women
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:54.360]  and then lying about it
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:56.360]  there's a recklessness
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:58.360]  and I tend to start agreeing with Tarpley
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:35:59.360]  that they don't know what they're doing
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:00.360]  that they're nuts
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:01.360]  they're out of control
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:03.360]  I mean they think they've got a plan
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:05.360]  they think they know what they're doing
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:09.360]  but more and more they're in a bunch of lazy out of control elitist
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:12.360]  so many historians we talked to point out that the old elites
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:15.360]  were corrupt but they were much more professional
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:18.360]  and that's even more scary that these people are out of control
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:20.360]  this ruling class are a bunch of lunatics
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:23.360]  we're talking to Dr. Tarpley about all of this
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:24.360]  here in just one moment
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:27.360]  first I want to tell you about some amazing sponsors

[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:06.360]  travel water bottles that filter the water

[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:16.360]  but sorry it's made in America

[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:09.360]  we're adding there. Now
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:12.360]  shifting gears to Webster Griffin Tarpley
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:14.360]  he is the author of George Bush
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:15.360]  the unauthorized biography
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:18.360]  he also wrote the authorized biography
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:19.360]  on Barack Hussein Obama
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.360]  and is one of our chief experts
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:24.360]  in my seminal film, The Obama Deception
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:28.360]  laying out everything that Obama would do
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:29.360]  and he indeed did do it
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.360]  people see Obama deception
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:32.360]  they're totally blown away
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:35.360]  he also has multiple degrees
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:38.360]  from Princeton, Summa Cum Laude
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:41.360]  and Pi Beta Kappa
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:42.360]  Fulbright Scholar
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:44.360]  University of Turin, Italy
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:46.360]  he is a doctor of history
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:49.360]  fluent in German, French, Latin, Russian, you name it
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:50.360]  he's a decades long expert
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:53.360]  in international terrorism
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.360]  he did a major study for the Italian Parliament
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:57.360]  I'm going to stop right there
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:59.360]  tarpley.net is his website
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:01.360]  and for those that just joined us Webster
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:04.360]  all Hades is breaking loose
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:07.360]  we see major global geopolitical realignments
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:10.360]  we see massive saber rattling everywhere
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:11.360]  we have the Chinese saying
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:14.360]  you've already technically defaulted
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:16.360]  you've got Vietnam starting to move towards the US
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:19.360]  you've got Pakistan running to China
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:20.360]  and Russia
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:22.360]  you've got the Russians openly threatening
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:25.360]  I mean things are really coming to a head
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.360]  what is behind all of this
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.360]  what's behind the Pakistanis
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:32.360]  arresting the CIA spies inside Pakistan
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:34.360]  what's going on
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:37.360]  am I right in saying that we've moved
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:39.360]  a few more minutes towards midnight
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:41.360]  on the world war 3 o'clock
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:42.360]  yes you're certainly right
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:45.360]  and it is of course this decadent degenerate US
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:47.360]  ruling class which is doing all this
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:49.360]  this is the initiative at least
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:50.360]  is coming from them
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:53.360]  it's a desperate attempt to reorganize the world
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:56.360]  by destroying most of the existing nation states
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:00.360]  and really destroying any possible focus of resistance
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:02.360]  against the International Monetary Fund
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:03.360]  the World Bank
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.360]  and the World Trade Organization
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:07.360]  I guess you're certainly right
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:10.360]  that things have gotten much worse in the past
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:11.360]  two to three weeks
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.360]  just for those who are keeping score
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.360]  we're now up to five wars
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.360]  we have Afghanistan, Iraq
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:19.360]  we have a latent war with Pakistan
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:22.360]  which is probably the biggest of these at the moment
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:25.360]  which is always on the verge of becoming an open
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:26.360]  shooting war
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:28.360]  we've got a war with Libya
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:30.360]  and just in the past couple of weeks
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:32.360]  we've added the war with Yemen
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.360]  which is a joint special operations command
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:38.360]  and CIA headquarters operating in the capital
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:40.360]  now that the US has succeeded
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:43.360]  in pretty much destroying the government of Yemen
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:47.360]  you're going to have Apache helicopters flying over there
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:51.360]  as well as the drones run by the CIA
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:53.360]  as well as the military
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.360]  so that makes five
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:58.360]  exactly number six is Syria
[01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:01.360]  if Syria comes it's likely to come with two others
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:03.360]  if you're at war with Syria
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:06.360]  you will probably soon be at war with Iran
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:07.360]  and with Hezbollah
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:10.360]  so that will get us up to eight
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:12.360]  and we've also as you're pointing out
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:15.360]  tensions now directly with the major nuclear power
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:16.360]  out there in the world
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:18.360]  which is of course Russian
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:21.360]  now just a couple of news updates
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:24.360]  according to a number of intelligence sources
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:26.360]  there is now a build up around Syria
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:29.360]  we've had the crescendo of this destabilization of Syria
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:34.360]  I regard this as commandos of the Muslim brotherhood
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:38.360]  probably armed through the Kurdish part of Iraq
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:39.360]  if you look at your map
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:41.360]  you'll see that the Kurds in northern Iraq
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:44.360]  would be able to smuggle things into Syria
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:46.360]  possibly also smuggled in through Jordan
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:48.360]  and other channels
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:51.360]  so we've got the USS Batan
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.360]  the amphibious assault ship
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:55.360]  which is standing by in the Mediterranean
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:57.360]  off the coast of Syria
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:00.360]  remember also you've got the British base on Cyprus
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:01.360]  which can be used
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:04.360]  so you don't need to have an aircraft carrier there
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:07.360]  the US right now has two aircraft carrier battle groups
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:09.360]  but out in the Arabian Sea
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:11.360]  pretty much off the coast of Yemen
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:13.360]  and off the coast of Saudi Arabia
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:16.360]  so there could be a military move
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:18.360]  by the US against Syria at any time
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:22.360]  and this could come in surprising forms
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:27.360]  we know that the capabilities are there
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.360]  one of the main targets of this of course
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:33.360]  is that the Russians have a naval base at Tartus
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:37.360]  the only real interesting base that the Russians have in the Mediterranean
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:39.360]  is in Syria
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:41.360]  so if you do go ahead and attack Syria
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:44.360]  you're going to get Russia into it much more directly
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:47.360]  and all this nonsense about the reset
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.360]  and these things that Medvedev has been saying
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:52.360]  about singing tomorrows between the US and Russia
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:54.360]  this turned out to be quite false
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:59.360]  now Iran is already accused by Hillary Clinton
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:02.360]  of having sent military forces into Syria
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:04.360]  this would be the Kurds force
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:08.360]  the Jerusalem force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:13.360]  they are presumably already acting to shore up the Assad regime in Syria
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:15.360]  Hezbollah from Lebanon
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:19.360]  is also reported to have sent forces into Syria
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:24.360]  now if you get a certain amount of Iranian and Hezbollah forces into Syria
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:29.360]  this could then be used by the Israelis as a pretext to start something
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:31.360]  or the US could seize on it
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:34.360]  we had a very rare speech by Hillary Clinton
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:37.360]  where she condemned two countries at the same time
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:41.360]  she condemned Syria and Iran in the same breath
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:44.360]  so this is about as tense as it can get
[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:46.360]  and you've also got to remember that Turkey
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:48.360]  sitting on the northern border of Syria
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:50.360]  this is of course a NATO country
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:54.360]  up to now the policies of Turkey have been relatively reasonable
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:57.360]  actually promising and positive in some cases
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:01.360]  but what happens to Turkey when they're threatened by a tide of refugees
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:04.360]  is certainly another question
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:07.360]  so you have this entire complex
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:11.360]  now to the degree that the US has been fomenting this insurrection
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:15.360]  through the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:19.360]  I think you can also say one of the ways the Iranians have been striking back
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:21.360]  is to heat up the situation in Iraq
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:24.360]  and if you look we know we're getting more and more reports of attacks
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:27.360]  by Shiite militias, by the Mahdi army
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:29.360]  on US forces in Iraq
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:31.360]  and the casualty lists have gone now sky high
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.360]  in the month of June
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:36.360]  I think that's a kind of retaliation by the Iranians
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:40.360]  to what they can obviously see the US is doing in Syria
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:45.360]  all made much more complicated by the presence of yet another controversial warship
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:47.360]  the USS Monterey
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:52.360]  this is an Aegis cruiser with anti-ballistic missile capabilities
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:54.360]  that's sitting in the Black Sea
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:58.360]  and the Russians as you mentioned have been vociferously protesting that
[01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:02.360]  now it's not clear whether that warship there violates any treaty
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:04.360]  the treaty would be the Treaty of Montreux
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:08.360]  which governs who can get through the Bosporus and the Dardanelles
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:12.360]  and the local straits between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:17.360]  but this warship there would be in a position to try to do some anti-ballistic missile work
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:22.360]  say if Iran were retaliating against European NATO countries
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:24.360]  taking part in an attack on Iran
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:25.360]  so the point is
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:27.360]  Webster to interrupt me for a moment
[01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:30.360]  is that the pieces are all actually being put in place
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:33.360]  for the first time in memory
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.360]  not even Bush did this
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:38.360]  they have a large regional war
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:41.360]  spreading from North Africa into the Middle East
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:43.360]  into Central and Southern Asia
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:46.360]  that would, if this continues
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:51.360]  this could really be called a Third World War
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:55.360]  that has been kicked off in the name of anti-terrorism
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:57.360]  and then you've got as the players
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:45:59.360]  Muslim Brigades
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:01.360]  known Saudi Arabian backed Al Qaeda
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:07.360]  as the good guys working in countries that have already fallen
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:10.360]  like Egypt to a certain extent Yemen
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:13.360]  also going up into Syria it's those groups
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:15.360]  same groups against Qaddafi
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:17.360]  and I hear good old boys on the radio going
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:19.360]  well I guess Al Qaeda's good
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:21.360]  you know we've got to work with them now
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:24.360]  and then now we're on American because we don't support Al Qaeda
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:27.360]  I mean we've entered an Orwellian La La land
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:30.360]  but I want to get to what the ruling class
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:32.360]  the offshore megacorporations
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:35.360]  that we pay the majority of our bailout
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:37.360]  taxpayer money to I want to explain
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:39.360]  when we hear USA is doing this
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:41.360]  you mean the criminal elite
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:43.360]  that has a free hand to run wild
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:46.360]  so what is their strategic plan
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:49.360]  just go ahead and start a major war
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:51.360]  from North Africa to Central Asia
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:53.360]  would that not be World War 3
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:56.360]  would that not induce China and others to be involved
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:47:00.360]  well remember their calculation is any independent nation state
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:02.360]  with any degree of autonomy
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:05.360]  is going to try to get out of the US Empire
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:09.360]  so therefore their goal is to destroy all existing nation states
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:12.360]  I think it's time to rethink the whole issue of the nation state
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:15.360]  in this chaos any nation state just about
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:18.360]  is better than the chaos that you're seeing for example in Yemen
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:21.360]  where you see a country that's now going into chaos and civil war
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:24.360]  but let's take two leading examples Saudi Arabia
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:28.360]  we have the Washington Post of a couple of days ago
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:31.360]  June 12th we have an article by Prince Turkey
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:33.360]  this guy is the former head of intelligence
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:36.360]  he's the top guy in the Saudi Arabian royal family
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:39.360]  this is yet another ultimatum to the United States
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:43.360]  he says if the United States votes against vetoes
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:47.360]  the creation of a Palestinian state in the United Nations
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:51.360]  there will be disastrous consequences for US-Saudi relations
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:53.360]  and then he goes on to say
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:55.360]  we Arabs used to say no to peace
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:59.360]  and we got our comeuppance in 1967
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:02.360]  now it is the Israelis who are saying no
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:05.360]  I'd hate to be around when the Israelis face their comeuppance
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:10.360]  this is widely seen as one of the heaviest threats that the Saudis have put down
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:14.360]  I would recall to people for the last time I heard language like that
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:18.360]  and you can read about this in my book 9-11 synthetic terror
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:21.360]  there is this statement from Saudi Arabia to the United States
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:25.360]  in August 2001 on the verge of 9-11
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:29.360]  then Crown Prince Abdullah sent a letter to Bush saying
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:31.360]  we have come to the parting of the ways
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:33.360]  we don't like your policies
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:35.360]  we're going to go our way and you go yours
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:37.360]  and of course that was stopped by 9-11
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:39.360]  one of the main goals of 9-11
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:41.360]  so we now enter the absolute prime zone
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:43.360]  just like we had economic collapse
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:45.360]  nothing compared to this going up to 9-11
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:48.360]  we're entering the prime zone for a pretext
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:51.360]  to launch the war so they've all got lined up
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:54.360]  and now burning
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:57.360]  to oh this is why we're launching the larger war
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:59.360]  this is why the troops are going in
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:01.360]  then the domestic clamp down
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:05.360]  they are now recruiting the postal service people to spy on you
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:07.360]  the TSAs rolling out on the streets
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:11.360]  you can really see how planned out this whole thing is
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:13.360]  to some extent
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:15.360]  the problem with the plan is
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:18.360]  the plan doesn't include the singularities that emerge
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:20.360]  and now let's take another one
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:24.360]  the other main country that is trying to break out of the empire
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:27.360]  that's been thoroughly integrated into it is of course Pakistan
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:29.360]  and you remember here we had the Chinese
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:31.360]  issuing that ultimatum three weeks ago
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:34.360]  if the United States attacks Pakistan
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:37.360]  that will be interpreted by China as an attack on China
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:39.360]  alright how could China strike back
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:41.360]  well there are hydrogen bomb missiles
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:43.360]  that's less likely
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:45.360]  but there's certainly a lot of treasury bonds
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:48.360]  there's probably two trillion dollars worth of treasury bonds
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:51.360]  and there's cyber warfare
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:54.360]  and we have now Panetta saying that the new Pearl Harbor
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:56.360]  is going to be a cyber attack
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:59.360]  now looking at the Pakistani side of that
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:03.360]  the Iranians, President Ahmadinejad of Iran
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:05.360]  who is facing destabilization
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:08.360]  has just run off to meet with the Russians and the Chinese
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:11.360]  well that's the Shanghai Cooperation Organization
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:14.360]  that's what people should be watching in the next couple of days
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:17.360]  in other words if there's going to be some kind of organized resistance
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:21.360]  against this rampage of the CIA and the British across the world
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:23.360]  it's probably going to come from Astana Kazakhstan
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:25.360]  which is where you've got the meeting
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:27.360]  of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:30.360]  but big deal is the President of Iran
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:34.360]  says that he has specific credible intelligence
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:38.360]  that the United States is about to launch an attack on the Pakistani nuclear forces
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:43.360]  now that by itself could be a war, a conflagration of tremendous
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:45.360]  and you've been saying that for several years
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:47.360]  and we have a lot of evidence to that
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:49.360]  Dr. Webster Griffin Tartley is our guest
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:50.360]  I'm Alex Jones
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:53.360]  this is the GCN Radio Network GCN Live.com
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:56.360]  our sites are MFallWars.com and PrismPlanet.tv
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:51:09.360]  we'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:55.360]  we'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:52:25.360]  we'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:55.360]  we'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:53:25.360]  we'll be right back.
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:53.360]  we'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:54:20.360]  we'll be right back.
[01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:46.360]  we'll be right back.
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:55:12.360]  we'll be right back.
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:38.360]  we'll be right back.
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:56:04.360]  we'll be right back.
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:30.360]  we'll be right back.
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:36.360]  and that's why you see Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, all of these countries, Libya, Algeria
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:39.360]  they're all attempting to go towards Russia.
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:42.360]  Yeah, bottom line is the same banks that have looted us
[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:45.360]  and that finance and control our whole military
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:49.360]  they are picking off the last countries that they want to loot
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:53.360]  and people are going to fight back and they've openly triggered the Muslim uprisings
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:56.360]  with our media calling it glorious and wonderful
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:00.360]  and how are things going for them because as we went to break
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:03.360]  you were talking about the trigger points
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:06.360]  how this could get a lot worse a lot quicker.
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:09.360]  Well the obvious trigger points are an attack on Pakistan
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:12.360]  with the Chinese having made these commitments
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:15.360]  forces the Chinese to do something about that
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:20.360]  and again it's either missiles or treasury bonds or cyber attacks
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:25.360]  and that's what Panetta is talking about with the Pearl Harbor statement right
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:28.360]  head of the CIA who is going to become the head of the Defense Department
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:31.360]  since the next Pearl Harbor is coming as a cyber attack
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:35.360]  and then he goes through a whole series of things which I don't believe cyber attacks
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:39.360]  can do right shut down power systems and cause mayhem and basic
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:43.360]  no only they can do that with the cyber security hub computers
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:46.360]  they've already put everywhere and undoubtedly the Chinese have said
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:49.360]  hey you're the ones really doing this right the military industrial complex
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:53.360]  wants the kill switch and they're going to do it and that's why at the Bilderberg meeting
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:57.360]  last week it was just chock full of the technology heads
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:02.360]  right there is of course an apocalyptic mood in the ruling class
[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:05.360]  the so-called Götter Demelung or Twilight of the Gods
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:10.360]  imagine that Bilderberger taking place actually in a bunker in Berlin
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:11.360]  Ragnarok
[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:16.360]  yeah something like this so that's one side of it
[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:20.360]  on the other hand they're also driven wild by the fact that their debt structures
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:24.360]  right there derivatives castle the 1.5 quadrillion
[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:29.360]  seems now to be coming down or closer to coming down in a panic
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:32.360]  than it has been in the past couple years remember
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:35.360]  we have been in the depressions in so seven oh eight
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:51.360]  you are listening to GCN
[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:55.360]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:59.360]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:01.360]  as we're finishing off this agenda
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:04.360]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home
[01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:08.360]  turning their influence on our president in Congress
[01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:10.360]  and they really are calling the shots
[01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:15.360]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:18.360]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:23.360]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:25.360]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:27.360]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:29.360]  they're asking for more matches
[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:32.360]  and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to
[01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:34.360]  today seems like nobody does care
[01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:36.360]  and right now in Washington DC
[01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:39.360]  we have seen a fall of the republic

[02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:19.360]  Guter Damarang, Twilight of the Gods, Ragnarok, into the world
[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:21.360]  that is the attitude
[02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:24.360]  their giant personal bunkers, government bunkers
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:28.360]  emergency seed vaults, huge weapons systems, domestic spy forces
[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:31.360]  all building towards the mop up for world government
[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:35.360]  to crown the JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs's of the world
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:40.360]  the open imperial rulers of the private world government
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:42.360]  and now it's all out in the open
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:44.360]  and they're going into high gear with their new alert systems
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:47.360]  demonizing anyone that doesn't want a world government
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:49.360]  attacking national sovereignty
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:51.360]  remember, these are globalists, they're attacking us
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:53.360]  while they attack foreign countries
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:55.360]  so people can think of it as a meal
[02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:59.360]  America's going to get them, Pakistanis going to get them, Iranians
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:02.360]  ladies and gentlemen, this is about global domination
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:05.360]  and we ain't in it, it's a big club and we ain't in it
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:07.360]  tarply continuing with the geopolitical
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:09.360]  we'll come back with the economical information
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:11.360]  what's happening on the economy front
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:15.360]  but continuing, clearly they're going to go forward with this
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:17.360]  they didn't launch all these over throws
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:19.360]  they didn't launch all these drone attacks
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:22.360]  they didn't take us to war with no congressional approval
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:25.360]  because they just want to see people free in the Middle East
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:28.360]  what is this meant to trigger and what is their battle plan?
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:31.360]  well I think the interesting thing is you're already beginning to hear
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:36.360]  to see signs that they're approaching this point of logistical breakdown
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:38.360]  of material overstretch
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:42.360]  look at the speech by outgoing Secretary of Defense Gates last week
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:47.360]  I think that was serious, that was a hysterical outburst really
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:53.360]  and it raised a lot of eyebrows in the sort of pundit community here in Washington
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:56.360]  Gates says, NATO is running out of bombs
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:01:59.360]  we don't have enough bombs, the Europeans are not doing enough
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:01.360]  you've got to do more, more, more, more, more
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:03.360]  you have two million under arms
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:07.360]  you're not able to get 30, 40,000 into Afghanistan
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:09.360]  I think that has to be taken seriously
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:13.360]  we also have a French admiral speaking in Belgrade, Serbia
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:15.360]  in the last couple of days also says
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:20.360]  something to the effect of we're reaching a point of logistical problem or strain
[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:25.360]  and I think that may be what's behind Baynor and even the entire House
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:27.360]  now the entire House says to Obama
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:30.360]  you've got to come to us and get approval
[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:33.360]  or there's no money for your war there in Libya
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:36.360]  I think this reflects an actual logistical strain
[02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:39.360]  and if we go through that list, if you're in five wars
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:42.360]  does that get you to logistical breakdown
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:45.360]  if we're in six and that's going to turn to seven to eight
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:47.360]  at some point along there
[02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:50.360]  there's going to be a logistical breakdown
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:53.360]  I was just looking last night at the list of aircraft carriers
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:55.360]  when you get into these crises
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:57.360]  you want to know where the aircraft carriers are
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:00.360]  and a significant number of them are being refitted
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:02.360]  three or four US aircraft carriers
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:04.360]  can't be used right now
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:08.360]  at least allegedly this is what's posted on certain websites
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:10.360]  as supposedly knowledgeable
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:12.360]  they're in shipyards getting refits
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:16.360]  so there are fewer aircraft carrier battle groups out there
[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:18.360]  than you would expect
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:21.360]  so where is the point of logistical breakdown
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:23.360]  at what point for example
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:25.360]  does the Russian government decide
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:28.360]  that Medvedev's traveling about the reset
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:31.360]  is simply unreal
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:35.360]  and get back to the hard, real, real politic of Putin
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:37.360]  the realistic power politics
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:39.360]  and realistic geopolitics
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:42.360]  and once you go the Chinese into action
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:44.360]  we've had the Chinese ultimatum
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:46.360]  stop playing with fire
[02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:48.360]  stop going to the edge of bankruptcy
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:51.360]  default chaos and world panic
[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:53.360]  stop doing that
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:55.360]  Webster, let me stop you for a minute and we'll come back and talk about it
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:57.360]  that's really the issue is the rhetoric
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:00.360]  has gone from even when countries are ready to go to war
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:02.360]  from friendliness on the surface
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:03.360]  to right out in the open
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:05.360]  you're going to destroy the world economy
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:06.360]  you've already defaulted
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:07.360]  you're already bankrupt
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:08.360]  what are you doing
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:09.360]  stop it
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:10.360]  the Russians are saying
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:11.360]  what are you doing
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:12.360]  get your ship out of there
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:14.360]  the Chinese are threatening
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:16.360]  in the South China Sea
[02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:20.360]  everything is getting more and more real
[02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:22.360]  everything is getting more and more out front
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:24.360]  I mean I don't even remember talk like this
[02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:26.360]  during the Cold War growing up
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:28.360]  and then meanwhile the average America
[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:31.360]  is running around talking about LeBron James
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:34.360]  we had two ultimatums coming from the Soviet Union
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:37.360]  one is the Suez Crisis in 1956
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:40.360]  Khrushchev told the British and the French in particular
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:43.360]  stop attacking Egypt or I have intermediate range
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:45.360]  ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:48.360]  then later on in the Berlin Crisis 61
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:50.360]  the US was told along with Britain and France
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:52.360]  get out of Berlin in six months or else
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:55.360]  I don't remember any ultimatums since then
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:56.360]  but now as you say
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:04:58.360]  stay there stay there stay there
[02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:27.360]  come back

[02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:36.360]  lose their power from weather related onages
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:38.360]  number five a solar power generator
[02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:41.360]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind

[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:14.360]  the United States is now recognized globally
[02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:17.360]  as one of the most impressive police states on earth
[02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:22.360]  this film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps

[02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:30.360]  has established an old powerful shadow state
[02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:34.360]  police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen
[02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:38.360]  prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship

[02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:44.360]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner
[02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:48.360]  it's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan

[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:26.360]  that are patiently holding a smattering of other really
[02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:30.360]  really important information like
[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:33.360]  congressman issa leaks ATF emails
[02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:38.360]  proving that they knowingly were shipping guns into Mexico
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:41.360]  so they could demonize the second amendment
[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:44.360]  that's a form of false flag terror right there
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:46.360]  people that doubt government does this
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:48.360]  there's a form right there
[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:50.360]  undoubtedly they admit these guns have been used to kill people
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:52.360]  there they are shipping them in
[02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:55.360]  because almost all the guns in Mexico on record are bought
[02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:58.360]  from the military fully auto grenade launchers
[02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:02.360]  you can't buy those guns in American gun store
[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:04.360]  you cannot get them period
[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:06.360]  you can't get grenades
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:10.360]  and the system is aware of this so they got caught shipping them in
[02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:12.360]  we told you that years ago with our sources
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:14.360]  now it's mainstream media
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:16.360]  that is some of the news
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:19.360]  I'm gonna be going over here today
[02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:23.360]  but before I go any further and back to Webster
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:27.360]  on the key issue of the global ruling elite
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:30.360]  trying to drive us off a cliff
[02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:34.360]  in their quest to keep their hegemonic system in place
[02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:37.360]  I want to remind listeners that we have incredible
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:41.360]  shortwave radios, books, videos,

[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:49.360]  information that will certainly strike up conversations with people

[02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:02.360]  we've got the TV network system we're building

[02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:10.360]  we couldn't do it without you

[02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:18.360]  there's also electronics in there
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:19.360]  a lot of it is made in America
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:21.360]  it's impossible to find some items that aren't
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:24.360]  but we have the Discover the Spirit of 1776 t-shirts
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:26.360]  that I designed that I'm really proud of

[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:31.360]  and those are very, very popular
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:33.360]  we've got the classic infowars.com shirt

[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:45.360]  and more at prismplanet.tv
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:48.360]  now if you didn't hear the last segment
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:50.360]  Webster and I were talking about
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:52.360]  the fact that there's never been such ultimatums
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:55.360]  issued by China and by Russia
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:58.360]  in the last really 50 years that we're seeing now
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:01.360]  and that this is a huge issue
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:05.360]  but what do the big banking cartels that own the U.S. and Europe
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:08.360]  and England through fraud Webster
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:12.360]  people say what's your proof, look at most of the bailout money folks
[02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:14.360]  and went overseas to private institutions
[02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:16.360]  and private banks, private families
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:18.360]  what do these globalists hope to get
[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:20.360]  because as they get America more in debt
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:24.360]  they finance the war and then they make the profits on both ends
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:26.360]  they get to dominate and destroy countries
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:29.360]  that we destroy for them
[02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:32.360]  then they get to loan them the money to rebuild
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:34.360]  and take control of them
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:36.360]  but at the same time
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:38.360]  I mean isn't this just about really
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:40.360]  a game of brinksmanship with the world
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:42.360]  that if they bullied China and Russia and others
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:45.360]  that somehow they'll continue to buy the T-bills
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:47.360]  because if that's what they want it isn't working
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:49.360]  China is dumping more and more
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:52.360]  they're not buying anything near what they were
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:55.360]  the Federal Reserve is monetizing over 75% now
[02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:57.360]  that means hyperinflation boys and girls
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:00.360]  that there's a total war against liberty
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:03.360]  domestically obviously bad guys are running the country
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:06.360]  I mean what does the ruling class hope to get from this
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:09.360]  because no one is giving in to them
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:11.360]  and they're still just going forward
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:13.360]  well we have to go back to Plato
[02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:16.360]  just to remind ourselves that the purpose of an oligarchy
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:18.360]  never changes the purpose of an oligarchy
[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:20.360]  is to maintain oligarchy
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:23.360]  and in this case it's an Anglo-American oligarchy
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:26.360]  again I call it imperialist rather than globalist
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:28.360]  because it's really not global
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:30.360]  it is centered in London and New York
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:33.360]  and the people you're going to see meeting in Astana
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:35.360]  at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:39.360]  are by and large those who have been excluded
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:42.360]  but I want to make something clear here
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:45.360]  it's not that I like the Chinese or the Russian governments
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:48.360]  government throughout history serious problems corrupt
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:50.360]  I'm an American the point I'm trying to get across
[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:53.360]  is the ruling class that runs our country
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:56.360]  hates us even more than they hate the Chinese and the Russians
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:12:58.360]  that's the point is that a lot of Americans are like
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:00.360]  well let's have a war with the Russians
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:02.360]  I'll feel patriotic
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:05.360]  they need to understand these interests are not our interest
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:08.360]  and when I say globalism I mean the name
[02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:11.360]  they've given this corporate
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:14.360]  unelected monopolistic capitalist system
[02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:16.360]  that's the opposite of free market
[02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:18.360]  I would also add people have got to understand
[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:20.360]  empire is bad for you
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:22.360]  empire doesn't help you
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:26.360]  the two big examples are out of Turkey telling the Turks
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:28.360]  give up on the Ottoman Empire
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:31.360]  be Turkey you'll be much better off
[02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:34.360]  that has worked I think for Turkey very well
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:36.360]  other example to go all telling the French
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:39.360]  give up Algeria don't be an empire
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:42.360]  you will be happier more prosperous more free
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:45.360]  you will have a whole series of advantages that you can't have
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:48.360]  that is and indeed if you look at people like Sakharov
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:51.360]  and some others in Russia telling the Russians
[02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:54.360]  the Soviet Empire is bad for you
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:57.360]  not good for you why do we have high unemployment
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:59.360]  why do we have declining standards of living
[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:01.360]  why do we have reactionary politics
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:03.360]  why do we have cultural degradation
[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:06.360]  why do we have this creeping police state dictatorship
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:09.360]  that you're pointing out quite correctly
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:11.360]  these are all fruits of empire
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:14.360]  get rid of the empire the United States as a powerful nation state
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:17.360]  could do much better than the United States as an empire
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:20.360]  we don't need six seven eight wars going on
[02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:24.360]  people would bag us in through soft power
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:26.360]  like they did thirty forty years ago
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:29.360]  well again I support the I am a proponent
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:32.360]  of the idea of the modern state and you're going to see the alternative
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:35.360]  take a look at Yemen and you're going to see
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:38.360]  that the alternative to the modern state is feudalism
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:41.360]  in some form it's either going to be tribalism warlords
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:44.360]  criminal enterprises or simply chaos
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:47.360]  simply the destruction and we see everything going to mercenaries
[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:51.360]  we see everything converting to corporate nation states
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:55.360]  within the countries tied to this global matrix
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:59.360]  and then waging war against the original nation states
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:01.360]  but again to quantify it Dr. Tarpley
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:05.360]  what does the ruling class think they're going to get
[02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:09.360]  out of all of this because they're not getting the world to not dump the dollar
[02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:11.360]  they're getting the opposite
[02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:13.360]  and so instead of admitting they're wrong
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:16.360]  they accelerate the program is that accurate
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:20.360]  well they would say Libya was interested in dumping the dollar
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:22.360]  Libya was inviting in the russians and the chinese
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:24.360]  Libya is now knocked out
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:26.360]  Libya is to some degree paralyzed
[02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:29.360]  and they say what we do in Libya we can do further
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:32.360]  remember that ultimately for them the goal is to ride this
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:34.360]  color revolution
[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:37.360]  military coup destabilization insurgency
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:39.360]  all the way to Tehran
[02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:40.360]  to Beijing
[02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:41.360]  and to Moscow
[02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:44.360]  and you can see that implicit in that is the threat
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:47.360]  kind of third world war that's evidently there
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:51.360]  but they would say with our color revolution methods
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:55.360]  with the methods of Jean Sharp and the Albert Einstein Institute
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:58.360]  and the National Endowment for Democracy
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:02.360]  we can essentially smash all the opposition in the world
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:06.360]  and then actually have a global empire with no significant setters
[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:09.360]  of resistance because right now Moscow, Beijing, Tehran
[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:12.360]  and others Ankara, Turkey
[02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:15.360]  maybe Indonesia right there are others that are
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:18.360]  somehow not following orders in the way that they want
[02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:21.360]  and by the way that's what the Financial Times of London is saying
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:23.360]  and that's for the establishment mouthpiece
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:27.360]  why would they come out and say words like America is crumbling
[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:30.360]  just as the British Empire crumbled
[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:32.360]  the American Empire is crumbling
[02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:35.360]  is that because they're going to try to scapegoat us
[02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:38.360]  when really their elite is piloting the thought process
[02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:43.360]  of much of this and then they'll try to scurry into other institutions
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:47.360]  I mean this is a British establishment indictment
[02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:51.360]  of the American Empire which they help create
[02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:54.360]  yes because ultimately in their view
[02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:57.360]  the United States as a nation state is the target
[02:16:57.360 --> 02:16:59.360]  in other words if you want to know who's fomenting things like
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:01.360]  secessionism, subversion
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:05.360]  and all kinds of other things designed to break up the United States
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:07.360]  you can look to London for that
[02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:10.360]  remember that this is what's known as an atomism
[02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:14.360]  in other words the British Empire in the old sense is long gone
[02:17:14.360 --> 02:17:17.360]  but the mentality is still there
[02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:20.360]  and when you get a breakdown crisis like the current one
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:24.360]  the old ghosts, the nightmare of past generations
[02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:26.360]  that's what I was going to say we are
[02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:29.360]  we are possessed by the ghosts of the British Empire
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:33.360]  yeah they are, I mean we're enslaved to it
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:35.360]  but they're embracing it
[02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:39.360]  so yes all of this is going on, the strangest, strangest things
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:42.360]  that you thought had been banished for the world for a long time
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:45.360]  and now coming forward as if they were serious
[02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:48.360]  but in the other hand, remember that the ruling elites of countries
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:51.360]  in the third world don't share this view
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:55.360]  in other words if you're in Moscow or Beijing or India too
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:58.360]  and to a significant degree or Brazil or Indonesia
[02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:01.360]  there's a different mentality in the third world
[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:04.360]  they want economic development, they want progress
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:08.360]  they want rising standards of living, full employment, modern science, modern technology
[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:12.360]  and so forth, of course all of these ruling elites have Malthusian factors
[02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:15.360]  that's why they sell the whole carbon tax situation
[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:18.360]  but they're only able to implement it in the west
[02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:24.360]  more crippling, further crippling their own imperial war system
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:28.360]  there's schizophrenia written all over this behavior
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:31.360]  yes, they're collectively insane is a good way to put it
[02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:35.360]  but remember it was China that stopped that worldwide carbon dictatorship
[02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:39.360]  I guess it was the Copenhagen conference in December of 2009
[02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:43.360]  it was the Chinese with a strategy to block it
[02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:47.360]  playing the developing countries against the United States
[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:49.360]  so again, there is an opposition in the world
[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:52.360]  and I think you have to look at it, that's a good thing
[02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:55.360]  because if you didn't have Russia, China, India and the rest of them
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:59.360]  the United States would be long since a total police state
[02:18:59.360 --> 02:19:01.360]  no liberties left whatsoever
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:03.360]  it's the fact that there is a foreign opposition
[02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:05.360]  that allows us to continue on here
[02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:07.360]  and we shouldn't kid ourselves about that
[02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:09.360]  oh, they would arrest us in a New York minute
[02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:12.360]  they'd stage a few more OKCs and come after us
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:14.360]  in this equation, Dr. Tarplein closing
[02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:17.360]  I see false flag as the ace in the hole
[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:21.360]  the only thing that will give the globalist, the Anglo-American elite
[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:24.360]  any chance of carrying out this current program
[02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:26.360]  alright, here's one concrete example
[02:19:26.360 --> 02:19:29.360]  I can't vouch for this because I don't know the details, I don't know the person
[02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:33.360]  there's a lawyer in Germany by the name of Van Kast
[02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:36.360]  hold on, we're going to have to do five more than I promised callers
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:39.360]  bottom of the hour, I'm going right to your calls and then a bunch of other news
[02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:42.360]  it's just overwhelming, but we're going to talk about false flag terror
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:47.360]  and I happen to have gotten multiple intel data points on something very big
[02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:51.360]  US troops out of Fort Hood, and I even know the divisions
[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:56.360]  and we need to get calls and more intel on this tomorrow
[02:19:56.360 --> 02:20:01.360]  the 1st Cavalry Division Heavy Armor III Corps are deploying to Libyam
[02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:04.360]  forget everything you've been told about long-term food storage

[02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:10.360]  hi I'm Jason Davenport and I've just completed ZeroDet100.com

[02:23:18.360 --> 02:23:22.360]  ZeroDet showed me how to get the banks to pay my property taxes and insurance
[02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:25.360]  while stopping my foreclosure without paying one dime
[02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:28.360]  an attorney tried to garnish my wages but the court denied his request
[02:23:28.360 --> 02:23:30.360]  because of what I filed from the ZeroDet program

[02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:54.360]  that's 800-477-9256
[02:23:54.360 --> 02:23:59.360]  or visit www.ZeroDet100.com
[02:24:06.360 --> 02:24:09.360]  Alright, final segment with Webster that we're going to your phone calls
[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:12.360]  I appreciate everybody holding and everybody tuning in and joining us today
[02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:15.360]  at the end of the day I just want my family to be free
[02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:17.360]  I want my private property rights
[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:19.360]  I want my liberty, my freedom
[02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:21.360]  I don't want to be part of a corrupt empire
[02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:25.360]  and there's no doubt that that's what America basically is today
[02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:29.360]  and there's no doubt that every form of liberty is under assault globally
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:32.360]  and China has riots going on all over its country
[02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:34.360]  Russia's got serious problems
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:38.360]  and it's mainly because the world's going into a depression
[02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:42.360]  and you see the riots and fights and crime exploding across the US
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:46.360]  and much of this is owed to the banking system we have
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:48.360]  that is devaluing currencies worldwide
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:51.360]  Now, terribly, we're getting into false flag terror
[02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:57.360]  and then I'm going to get more into this military deployment news
[02:24:57.360 --> 02:24:59.360]  that I have for the month of October
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:02.360]  we're going to try to confirm this through some other sources
[02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:06.360]  but I mean you concur overall that we see a lot of pre-hyping
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:09.360]  for domestic terror, foreign terror, cyber security attacks
[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:12.360]  I'm seeing the same preparatory propaganda
[02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:16.360]  I saw pre-911 that induced myself to go on air
[02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:18.360]  and say they're going to blow up the World Trade Center
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:20.360]  and blame it on their asset bin Laden
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:23.360]  Yes, well that was a great achievement for you at the time
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:28.360]  and the Saudis with Prince Turkey making that ultimatum
[02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:31.360]  to the United States and the pages of the Washington Post
[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:35.360]  takes us back again to the similar kind of ultimatum
[02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:39.360]  that Saudi Arabia was sending in August of 2001
[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:41.360]  we have reached the parting of the ways
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:45.360]  and that's one of the key pillars of the empire
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:49.360]  so yes, false flag, now here's the one hypothesis that I'm aware of
[02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:52.360]  that might be of interest, Van Gaest
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:58.360]  G-E-E-S-T is a German lawyer in the rural area
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:00.360]  I think in the city of Essen
[02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:04.360]  and he is attempting to get a temporary restraining order
[02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:06.360]  or an injunction if he can
[02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:09.360]  to stop any and all terror drills
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:12.360]  organized in Berlin, Germany
[02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:17.360]  around the opening of the World Women's Soccer Championship
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:21.360]  which is going to be at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:24.360]  starting on the 26th of June
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:26.360]  And why are drills important for those that don't know?
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:28.360]  Well, I think that's, I don't know the facts
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:30.360]  I don't know Van Gaest and I don't know his facts
[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:32.360]  We know they always use drills
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:34.360]  We know that the method, this is exactly the right method
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:36.360]  so whatever else he's doing
[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:39.360]  he's at least showing people what you have to be aware of
[02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:43.360]  that when the drill goes live, when the drill is flipped live
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:45.360]  is the moment when something happened
[02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:47.360]  so he's basically trying to get out in front
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:50.360]  which I think if everything else adds up
[02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:52.360]  that's the good thing to do
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:54.360]  get out in front of the drills
[02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:57.360]  and try to stop them with legal action if you can
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:00.360]  but in one minute, explain it
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:02.360]  drills are used to condition the public
[02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:04.360]  to create a subconscious illusion
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:07.360]  because the subconscious sees the drills as real terror attacks
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:10.360]  it's to hype something that's nearly non-existent
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:12.360]  as a pretext to take liberties
[02:27:12.360 --> 02:27:13.360]  but that's only one use
[02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:15.360]  in every major stage terror attack
[02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:17.360]  on record, drills are run
[02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:19.360]  in case other elements of the government
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:22.360]  catch the government people carrying out the attack
[02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:24.360]  they're told it's a drill
[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:26.360]  it's also used to bootleg the attack
[02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:28.360]  with the funding and it's used
[02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:31.360]  to show echelon and other spying systems
[02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:33.360]  picking up chatter of the drill
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:36.360]  just believe it's a drill and not the real attack
[02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:38.360]  so it's a cloaking device, correct?
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:40.360]  Yes, there's an invisible government
[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:42.360]  in other words, the thing that does these events
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:45.360]  like 9-11 is not the United States government as a whole
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:46.360]  it can't be
[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:49.360]  it's got to be a privately controlled network
[02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:51.360]  I would say a Wall Street network
[02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:54.360]  think of it as the Allen Dulles CIA network
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:56.360]  or something like that in our present time
[02:27:56.360 --> 02:27:57.360]  It's an inner merc group
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:27:59.360]  just like we knew six years ago but now it's admitted
[02:27:59.360 --> 02:28:02.360]  there's a camp within Camp X-ray
[02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:05.360]  where they kill the people called Camp No
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:07.360]  because you have asked if you're ever leaving
[02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:09.360]  you're told no, you're dead
[02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:11.360]  they always have systems within systems
[02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:13.360]  It's completely illegal
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:15.360]  and we should never give up the terrain of legality
[02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:17.360]  because they're illegal
[02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:20.360]  and people who are objecting to this are not illegal
[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:22.360]  but in this case the invisible government
[02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:26.360]  the rogue network, this private parallel government
[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:28.360]  they have got to bootleg their activities
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:31.360]  through the official existing government institutions
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:33.360]  because they need the resources, they can't do it
[02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:35.360]  without controlling government resources
[02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:39.360]  so the only way to do that is to create an approved legal drill
[02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:43.360]  that's sanctioned and announced an otherwise kosher
[02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:45.360]  and then make changes in that
[02:28:45.360 --> 02:28:46.360]  make small changes
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:48.360]  if people want to see how this works
[02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:51.360]  you can look at that Tom Cruise film about Valkyrie
[02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:53.360]  where they take an existing drill, Valkyrie
[02:28:53.360 --> 02:28:55.360]  and they rewrite it
[02:28:55.360 --> 02:28:59.360]  and instead of being a plan to maintain Nazi rule
[02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:01.360]  it becomes a plan to end it
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:03.360]  by the way, that's a true story
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:05.360]  so that's an example of how it can be reversed
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:07.360]  it's a great way to show people how it works
[02:29:07.360 --> 02:29:09.360]  by the way, Fox News
[02:29:09.360 --> 02:29:11.360]  Fox TV was approached, we confirmed this
[02:29:11.360 --> 02:29:13.360]  we broke this with stars of the show
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:15.360]  the X-Files Lone Gumman spinoff
[02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:17.360]  a year before and then six months before
[02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:20.360]  aired a special where a group within government
[02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:23.360]  uses a drill of flying a hijacked jet in the World Trade Center
[02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:26.360]  to make government stand down to do it
[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:28.360]  and then of course they really did it a few months later
[02:29:28.360 --> 02:29:30.360]  old part of throwing it in our face
[02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:32.360]  Webster Griffin, Tarpley, Tarpley.net
[02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:34.360]  always amazing having you on my friend
[02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:36.360]  let me say bye to you during the break
[02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:38.360]  always great to talk to you on and off air
[02:29:38.360 --> 02:29:40.360]  your calls and a ton of key news
[02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:42.360]  straight ahead on the other side
[02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:45.360]  Congress is suing Obama over his illegal Libya war
[02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:47.360]  that could be a really positive sign
[02:29:47.360 --> 02:30:01.360]  we'll be right back, stay with us
[02:30:17.360 --> 02:30:21.360]  well they make blue diamond gusset jeans
[02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:25.360]  they so pride in every stitch
[02:30:25.360 --> 02:30:30.360]  guarantee you love the way they fit
[02:30:30.360 --> 02:30:33.360]  they put a diamond gusset in the crotch
[02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:35.360]  where you need it most
[02:30:35.360 --> 02:30:38.360]  blue diamond gussets got it
[02:30:38.360 --> 02:30:40.360]  others don't
[02:30:40.360 --> 02:30:42.360]  we turned jeans inside out

[02:31:00.360 --> 02:31:02.360]  this is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons
[02:31:02.360 --> 02:31:04.360]  you should consider buying a solar powered generator
[02:31:04.360 --> 02:31:07.360]  number one, new climate legislation
[02:31:07.360 --> 02:31:09.360]  could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:11.360]  number two, our new energies are
[02:31:11.360 --> 02:31:13.360]  wants to control how much power
[02:31:13.360 --> 02:31:15.360]  your electric company allows you to have
[02:31:15.360 --> 02:31:17.360]  it's true, total government control
[02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:19.360]  of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:21.360]  technology is coming
[02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:23.360]  number three, in some areas of the country
[02:31:23.360 --> 02:31:25.360]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:31:25.360 --> 02:31:27.360]  and now, new socialist legislation
[02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:29.360]  is only compounding the problem
[02:31:29.360 --> 02:31:31.360]  number four, dangerous weather is always
[02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:33.360]  a threat to local grids
[02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:35.360]  every year, thousands of families lose their power
[02:31:35.360 --> 02:31:37.360]  from weather related onages
[02:31:37.360 --> 02:31:39.360]  number five, a solar powered generator
[02:31:39.360 --> 02:31:41.360]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:31:41.360 --> 02:31:43.360]  folks, I really believe in the solar powered generators
[02:31:43.360 --> 02:31:45.360]  offered by solutions from science
[02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:47.360]  one of my oldest sponsors

[02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:05.360]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to
[02:32:05.360 --> 02:32:07.360]  spot savings, opportunity
[02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:09.360]  and recognized risk
[02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:11.360]  saving means to make money
[02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:13.360]  that company can save you thousands of dollars
[02:32:13.360 --> 02:32:15.360]  and give you good old fashioned real soaps
[02:32:15.360 --> 02:32:17.360]  that are triple concentrated
[02:32:17.360 --> 02:32:19.360]  and twice as good as what you're using now
[02:32:19.360 --> 02:32:21.360]  soaps made from vegetable
[02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:23.360]  and coconut oils that contain no useless
[02:32:23.360 --> 02:32:25.360]  dyes, perfumes, deodorants
[02:32:25.360 --> 02:32:27.360]  or antibacterials
[02:32:27.360 --> 02:32:29.360]  your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[02:32:29.360 --> 02:32:31.360]  that give you rashes
[02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:33.360]  itching sores

[02:32:37.360 --> 02:32:39.360]  you've never had before, you have to do something
[02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:41.360]  that you've never done before

[02:33:05.360 --> 02:33:07.360]  front line report

[02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:11.360]  you are the resistance
[02:33:11.360 --> 02:33:37.360]  extremism and defense of liberty is no vice
[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:41.680]  the
[02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:43.840]  video editor of the channel
[02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:45.840]  Kevin Cider with exclusive videos
[02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:47.840]  news articles and photos sent out every friday
[02:33:47.840 --> 02:33:49.840]  at 2pm central
[02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:51.840]  a lot of folks have signed up for that
[02:33:51.840 --> 02:33:53.840]  at the top of info wars.com
[02:33:53.840 --> 02:33:55.840]  you see the yellow banner
[02:33:55.840 --> 02:33:57.840]  just put your email address in
[02:33:57.840 --> 02:33:59.840]  and we'll send it right over to you
[02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:01.840]  and we had a lot of folks
[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:03.840]  so they loved it but make sure a lot of you
[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:05.840]  because of the spam filters
[02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:11.620]  minutes, but I want to go over this because I've gotten emails, phone calls, and chatter
[02:34:11.620 --> 02:34:15.140]  in the last month all basically saying the same thing.
[02:34:15.140 --> 02:34:19.500]  Now this doesn't mean it's 100% because the troops are told they're going to be deploying
[02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:25.740]  and sometimes they're not, but then I add this together with a plethora of other data
[02:34:25.740 --> 02:34:27.700]  points and it has a lot of credibility.
[02:34:27.700 --> 02:34:31.500]  Now we're told, oh, they're going to be there through next year and they're getting the
[02:34:31.500 --> 02:34:32.500]  helicopters.
[02:34:32.500 --> 02:34:35.740]  The British helicopters have been attacking for a few weeks and more US and British
[02:34:35.740 --> 02:34:41.780]  advisers and mercenaries and commandos on the front lines going in against Qaddafi.
[02:34:41.780 --> 02:34:46.860]  Remember this is going to last days, not weeks, and it's not a war, it's a kinetic action
[02:34:46.860 --> 02:34:51.300]  because the government doesn't lie and Wiener didn't send those photos, but he did.
[02:34:51.300 --> 02:34:54.500]  And Obama's hiring people to give him campaign contributions, is he legal?
[02:34:54.500 --> 02:34:55.500]  But so what?
[02:34:55.500 --> 02:35:00.100]  I mean, again, it's just total criminality out in the open, but I get these types of,
[02:35:00.100 --> 02:35:03.120]  I'm not going to read the entire letter here on air because it's got some information I
[02:35:03.120 --> 02:35:10.660]  probably shouldn't get to, but military personnel are saying that this information needs to
[02:35:10.660 --> 02:35:13.260]  be passed on to you.
[02:35:13.260 --> 02:35:15.420]  This is from Soldier Station at Fort Hood, Texas.
[02:35:15.420 --> 02:35:19.740]  The information is that special forces are going into Libya in July.
[02:35:19.740 --> 02:35:23.220]  They're already there, ladies and gentlemen, just more from Hood.
[02:35:23.220 --> 02:35:28.740]  First cavalry division, heavy armor and third corps are deploying to Libya in late October
[02:35:28.740 --> 02:35:29.820]  and early November.
[02:35:29.820 --> 02:35:32.540]  That means ground war involvement in the plan.
[02:35:32.540 --> 02:35:35.700]  Well, yeah, that's always been the plan.
[02:35:35.700 --> 02:35:37.380]  Please do whatever you can to get this information out.
[02:35:37.380 --> 02:35:39.420]  I'm sure Americans don't want another war.
[02:35:39.420 --> 02:35:40.420]  Here's what's going to happen.
[02:35:40.420 --> 02:35:44.700]  Quickly, because I want to talk to everybody, but I want to get these guys on, Adam, David,
[02:35:44.700 --> 02:35:45.700]  Kevin, Kevin and John.
[02:35:45.700 --> 02:35:47.780]  I'm just going to have time to get to those calls.
[02:35:47.780 --> 02:35:51.860]  And as you hear phone callers hang up, if you're at Fort Hood or in the military, call
[02:35:51.860 --> 02:35:52.860]  us and let us know.
[02:35:52.860 --> 02:35:53.860]  This is true.
[02:35:53.860 --> 02:35:55.380]  Look, Congress is suing.
[02:35:55.380 --> 02:35:57.780]  Banner of the Speaker of the House is saying it's illegal.
[02:35:57.780 --> 02:35:58.780]  It's a UN war.
[02:35:58.780 --> 02:35:59.780]  It's a fraud.
[02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:00.780]  This is treason.
[02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:05.500]  And so it's the right thing to do to confirm if they are planning the ground war before
[02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:09.540]  they stage some terror attack in America and claim Gaddafi did it.
[02:36:09.540 --> 02:36:13.060]  You notice the already have the troops ready will stage the attack and claim that the troops
[02:36:13.060 --> 02:36:17.980]  just appeared off the coast magically like Bush did, signing the order to attack Afghanistan
[02:36:17.980 --> 02:36:22.620]  in one week on September 10th and having the 44,000 US troops already massed.
[02:36:22.620 --> 02:36:26.980]  They claim that they just were teleported by Scotty and the enterprise over there.
[02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:30.500]  No, it's all being lined up, all set up troops.
[02:36:30.500 --> 02:36:31.740]  And I want to hear from you.
[02:36:31.740 --> 02:36:37.740]  As soon as we go to these callers, you'll have to call in 1-800-259-9231.
[02:36:37.740 --> 02:36:40.580]  Please don't call folks unless you're troops because we need to leave these lines open
[02:36:40.580 --> 02:36:48.740]  as they open up 800-259-9231-800-259-9231.
[02:36:48.740 --> 02:36:52.140]  Or if you're the wife or husband of somebody in the military, we want to hear from you
[02:36:52.140 --> 02:36:53.140]  on this.
[02:36:53.140 --> 02:36:54.140]  This is big.
[02:36:54.140 --> 02:36:56.300]  And we'll obviously get more intel now that I've announced this and we'll have more for
[02:36:56.300 --> 02:36:57.300]  you tomorrow.
[02:36:57.300 --> 02:37:01.940]  Well, in Alabama, we ran up to a break, you were bringing up a point about Ron Paul winning
[02:37:01.940 --> 02:37:07.700]  in all the polls except for a CNBC that was then used by CNN and others with 54 votes
[02:37:07.700 --> 02:37:09.940]  to tell people that he got zero votes.
[02:37:09.940 --> 02:37:11.940]  Anybody that believes that, I got a bridge to sell you.
[02:37:11.940 --> 02:37:14.700]  What was your other point quickly, Adam?
[02:37:14.700 --> 02:37:18.380]  My second point was the kind of a quick story.
[02:37:18.380 --> 02:37:23.180]  My girlfriend works for a loss prevention at a department store and I went with her
[02:37:23.180 --> 02:37:28.460]  on her lunch break to file a warrant for the shoplifter and I walk into the police station
[02:37:28.460 --> 02:37:32.540]  that's been deemed a public safety center and it's got all those big federal grants
[02:37:32.540 --> 02:37:33.540]  from Homeland Security.
[02:37:33.540 --> 02:37:39.540]  I walk in and there's the big badges up on the wall, the seals, three-foot signs.
[02:37:39.540 --> 02:37:43.860]  They were the local county seals and then the other ones were the United States Department
[02:37:43.860 --> 02:37:45.780]  of Homeland Security, U.S. Security.
[02:37:45.780 --> 02:37:48.700]  They're merging the feds with the local police and acclimating everyone.
[02:37:48.700 --> 02:37:49.700]  Oh yeah.
[02:37:49.700 --> 02:37:58.140]  And after that, one of my very close friends is a police officer and about a week ago,
[02:37:58.140 --> 02:38:03.380]  had some goon come to their local police department, I already know all of this, I had them come
[02:38:03.380 --> 02:38:10.020]  and say sovereign citizens are bad, they're all crazy, Ron Paul's the devil, 9-11 truthers
[02:38:10.020 --> 02:38:14.420]  are going to kill all the police officers and everything like that and there's going
[02:38:14.420 --> 02:38:16.380]  to be an upcoming attack.
[02:38:16.380 --> 02:38:21.460]  And I agree with you that they're going to try to blame it on anybody that's for the
[02:38:21.460 --> 02:38:22.460]  Constitution.
[02:38:22.460 --> 02:38:25.620]  Anybody, they're going to try to spin this somehow with all these-
[02:38:25.620 --> 02:38:30.260]  And I want to tell good old boys something, when they blow stuff up and stick the American
[02:38:30.260 --> 02:38:35.660]  flags out and say that patriots did it, if you go along and shut up, America's done.
[02:38:35.660 --> 02:38:38.860]  Okay, these are terrorist criminals running the government.
[02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:41.140]  They want their domestic security forces lined up.
[02:38:41.140 --> 02:38:44.140]  Now, here's a $64 million question.
[02:38:44.140 --> 02:38:47.780]  Who's your police officer friend buying this?
[02:38:47.780 --> 02:38:54.420]  He is to an extent, I tried to inform them on a lot of stuff, but I mean they had somebody
[02:38:54.420 --> 02:38:59.100]  good because they came in and showed them the video of that father and son shooting
[02:38:59.100 --> 02:39:04.660]  a cop and told them that anybody that's for the Constitution is bad, if you see anybody
[02:39:04.660 --> 02:39:09.740]  with a 9-11 truth bumper sticker that they're radicals and if you pull them over to ride
[02:39:09.740 --> 02:39:14.580]  them a speeding ticket, they're going to shoot you and it's just complete fear-mongering.
[02:39:14.580 --> 02:39:19.740]  And what's going to happen is if they attack enough people, they're going to get resistance.
[02:39:19.740 --> 02:39:21.420]  It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:39:21.420 --> 02:39:26.380]  Meanwhile, the biggest danger is the drug gangs killing cops or cops down in automobile
[02:39:26.380 --> 02:39:27.380]  accidents.
[02:39:27.380 --> 02:39:32.660]  They'll use a few examples of nuts killing cops, hype it up to basically create this
[02:39:32.660 --> 02:39:36.820]  war against the American people, and it's always been planned.
[02:39:36.820 --> 02:39:38.020]  I appreciate your call, Adam.
[02:39:38.020 --> 02:39:43.660]  And yes, that's what the new emergency alert is, is constant to the local police scaring
[02:39:43.660 --> 02:39:47.740]  the daylights out of them and then having the locals come out and announce all the fear,
[02:39:47.740 --> 02:39:52.100]  knowing that'll actually create fear because folks trust local police a lot more than they
[02:39:52.100 --> 02:39:55.980]  trust the feds, but the local police have been federalized.
[02:39:55.980 --> 02:39:59.180]  And don't worry cops, the new order wins, you're not getting your pension fund, you're
[02:39:59.180 --> 02:40:05.220]  not getting social security, but it'll be fun to hate those constitutionalists that you
[02:40:05.220 --> 02:40:08.740]  swore an oath to, you swear an oath to it, but it's evil.
[02:40:08.740 --> 02:40:10.380]  David in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:40:10.380 --> 02:40:11.380]  Go ahead.
[02:40:11.380 --> 02:40:12.380]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:40:12.380 --> 02:40:15.500]  I resonate with the same sentiment that you have as far as being a red-blooded American
[02:40:15.500 --> 02:40:18.740]  and want the best for my family and to protect myself and my property.
[02:40:18.740 --> 02:40:20.580]  I just want to bring up two things really quick.
[02:40:20.580 --> 02:40:27.020]  I live in Illinois, Obama land, and I noticed that as I passed from Illinois over to Indiana
[02:40:27.020 --> 02:40:30.820]  on my way to work, I've noticed for the past two weeks that there's small town on the border
[02:40:30.820 --> 02:40:35.500]  of Illinois has been following, the town police has been following police over into Indiana
[02:40:35.500 --> 02:40:39.180]  and writing them tickets in the state of Indiana.
[02:40:39.180 --> 02:40:42.820]  And they're unifying the codes under federal control.
[02:40:42.820 --> 02:40:49.100]  They're getting everybody trained in MJTFs under TSA and threat fusion to just have no
[02:40:49.100 --> 02:40:50.100]  jurisdictions.
[02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:51.100]  It's all being erased.
[02:40:51.100 --> 02:40:54.420]  It feels that way, and that's just an in-your-face thing.
[02:40:54.420 --> 02:41:02.060]  And secondly, and lastly, State Attorney General has just released our firearm owner's identification
[02:41:02.060 --> 02:41:06.780]  card, which all Illinois state citizens have to have basically a driver's license, if you
[02:41:06.780 --> 02:41:08.140]  will, to own a gun.
[02:41:08.140 --> 02:41:09.140]  Yes.
[02:41:09.140 --> 02:41:14.300]  Our Attorney General, Lisa Madigan, has just released all of the state citizens that have
[02:41:14.300 --> 02:41:19.500]  a void card to the state police for the future gun grab that's coming up.
[02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:20.500]  What do you have to say about that?
[02:41:20.500 --> 02:41:24.460]  They publish them in newspapers as a form of harassment against you.
[02:41:24.460 --> 02:41:28.380]  And then I've seen newspapers in Illinois and other states that do this actually pick
[02:41:28.380 --> 02:41:32.500]  people out of the list and demonize them for owning a gun.
[02:41:32.500 --> 02:41:36.860]  It's a cult of aggressive people trying to bully us, and you watch, they're going to
[02:41:36.860 --> 02:41:39.180]  shoot up malls.
[02:41:39.180 --> 02:41:40.180]  That's the script.
[02:41:40.180 --> 02:41:45.740]  They're going to say that patriots, anti-globalists, people that don't like the Federal Reserve,
[02:41:45.740 --> 02:41:50.380]  work with Al-Qaeda, and they're going to say, turn your guns in, prove you're not with
[02:41:50.380 --> 02:41:52.260]  the white Al-Qaeda.
[02:41:52.260 --> 02:41:56.260]  And a lot of good old boys are going to go crying, turning their guns in when this happens.
[02:41:56.260 --> 02:42:00.980]  And then they're going to wish, folks, you better wake up to stage terror, because it's
[02:42:00.980 --> 02:42:04.020]  the secret weapon that's going to bring all of America down.
[02:42:04.020 --> 02:42:05.020]  I appreciate your call, David.
[02:42:05.020 --> 02:42:09.940]  Now, we've got two lines open now for military about this Fort Hood deployment or other deployments
[02:42:09.940 --> 02:42:10.940]  to Libya.
[02:42:10.940 --> 02:42:14.140]  I mean, it's already admitted they're getting ready for it, but we'd like to hear it directly
[02:42:14.140 --> 02:42:18.140]  from you or tell us if we're wrong, 800-259-9231.
[02:42:18.140 --> 02:42:22.420]  I know it's on short notice, but we'll get emails or calls tomorrow if you can't get
[02:42:22.420 --> 02:42:23.420]  through today.
[02:42:23.420 --> 02:42:25.420]  Kevin in New York, you're on the air.
[02:42:25.420 --> 02:42:26.420]  Thank you.
[02:42:26.420 --> 02:42:27.420]  Hi, Alex.
[02:42:27.420 --> 02:42:28.420]  How are you?
[02:42:28.420 --> 02:42:29.420]  I'm all right, but it's all coming to a head.
[02:42:29.420 --> 02:42:30.820]  I wish I'd been wrong all these years.
[02:42:30.820 --> 02:42:31.820]  Yeah, I hear you.
[02:42:31.820 --> 02:42:36.340]  I just wanted to talk to you real quick about an incident that took place at JFK Airport
[02:42:36.340 --> 02:42:38.380]  at PSA about two months ago.
[02:42:38.380 --> 02:42:42.980]  I was meeting a friend that was coming in from Europe, and I was sitting there waiting
[02:42:42.980 --> 02:42:50.260]  for them to clear customs, and I noticed a young woman of Asian descent walking around
[02:42:50.260 --> 02:42:56.660]  with a camera, taking photographs with a telephoto lens of all the structural connections and
[02:42:56.660 --> 02:42:59.900]  all the structural columns in the building.
[02:42:59.900 --> 02:43:03.300]  I watched her for about three or four minutes just to make sure that she was doing what
[02:43:03.300 --> 02:43:04.300]  I knew she was doing.
[02:43:04.300 --> 02:43:06.540]  It was probably a drill.
[02:43:06.540 --> 02:43:11.820]  They had the drills to create paranoia in the TSA, but tell us what happened.
[02:43:11.820 --> 02:43:14.100]  My whole family is retired, high-level NYPD.
[02:43:14.100 --> 02:43:18.260]  I happened to be in construction, so I knew what she was looking at.
[02:43:18.260 --> 02:43:22.260]  I went over to the TSA agents and said, look, there's somebody here chasing the place,
[02:43:22.260 --> 02:43:26.060]  taking photographs, and I think you need to at least address it with them, find out what
[02:43:26.060 --> 02:43:27.060]  they're doing.
[02:43:27.060 --> 02:43:33.740]  They basically spent 10 minutes trying to find somebody who could go investigate this.
[02:43:33.740 --> 02:43:38.980]  They spent more time asking me questions about why I was so interested, and finally I had
[02:43:38.980 --> 02:43:41.740]  to say to them, look, no more nonsense with you people.
[02:43:41.740 --> 02:43:45.420]  You're either going to do your job, or I'm going to go call that person until the NYPD
[02:43:45.420 --> 02:43:46.580]  gets here and I'll make a phone call.
[02:43:46.580 --> 02:43:49.260]  So they were trying to act like you were the bad guy?
[02:43:49.260 --> 02:43:50.260]  Yeah.
[02:43:50.260 --> 02:43:53.500]  They basically, what happened was they went over, talked to her.
[02:43:53.500 --> 02:43:58.340]  She showed ID from Columbia University, told them that she was an architectural student,
[02:43:58.340 --> 02:44:02.100]  and architectural students don't care about general support beams and columns.
[02:44:02.100 --> 02:44:05.700]  You know, there was something unique from an architectural standpoint, maybe I could
[02:44:05.700 --> 02:44:06.700]  see them taking photographs.
[02:44:06.700 --> 02:44:10.300]  These were just basically high beams that were tied together, and she was not taking
[02:44:10.300 --> 02:44:11.300]  a while to follow up.
[02:44:11.300 --> 02:44:15.820]  You know Chinese intelligence on record is casing and diagramming the entire United
[02:44:15.820 --> 02:44:18.860]  States infrastructure, but they're not a problem.
[02:44:18.860 --> 02:44:23.220]  We got to worry about those guys with American flags on their cars because, you know, they
[02:44:23.220 --> 02:44:26.420]  don't like the communism.
[02:44:26.420 --> 02:44:30.100]  It's funny because they then ended up, I definitely came back with this bogus story.
[02:44:30.100 --> 02:44:32.940]  I was like, look, she's an architectural student.
[02:44:32.940 --> 02:44:35.180]  She's not, it's not a structural engineer.
[02:44:35.180 --> 02:44:37.180]  Why would she take taking pictures of support columns?
[02:44:37.180 --> 02:44:40.100]  There's nothing architecturally beautiful about this building.
[02:44:40.100 --> 02:44:43.940]  There you people listening to, they then proceeded to have two of their people follow me or
[02:44:43.940 --> 02:44:48.020]  told my friend came out, but I was kind of watching the woman keeping an eye on her,
[02:44:48.020 --> 02:44:50.060]  and they had two people following me.
[02:44:50.060 --> 02:44:51.940]  I eventually went up to them and said, why are you following me?
[02:44:51.940 --> 02:44:53.380]  They said, oh, we're not following you.
[02:44:53.380 --> 02:44:57.100]  I was like, look, I've walked, I literally walked around paths to see what they were
[02:44:57.100 --> 02:45:00.740]  doing, and they both kept me in eyesight the whole time, like I was the threat as opposed
[02:45:00.740 --> 02:45:01.740]  to the person with the camera.
[02:45:01.740 --> 02:45:04.220]  Well, that's because it's all security theater.
[02:45:04.220 --> 02:45:08.540]  It's like Janet Napolitano said two weeks ago, I mean, if you believe the official story
[02:45:08.540 --> 02:45:13.780]  about, you know, the terror threat being entirely Arab or Muslim, she said there's no logical
[02:45:13.780 --> 02:45:17.020]  sense to profile young Arab men.
[02:45:17.020 --> 02:45:22.260]  I mean, that's like saying there's no logical sense in saying the sun's gonna come up tomorrow
[02:45:22.260 --> 02:45:23.940]  because they can't ever do that.
[02:45:23.940 --> 02:45:27.940]  It's got to be that it's all Americans, trust no one, but the government, because they're
[02:45:27.940 --> 02:45:31.660]  getting ready to flip the narrative onto the American people.
[02:45:31.660 --> 02:45:35.060]  I appreciate your call, great points.
[02:45:35.060 --> 02:45:40.980]  You just got specialist in the military, specialist H out of Georgia.
[02:45:40.980 --> 02:45:45.420]  What can you tell us about the letters and emails and calls I'm getting that the troops
[02:45:45.420 --> 02:45:51.700]  are being told that the first cavalry heavy armored division with three corps are deploying
[02:45:51.700 --> 02:45:57.740]  to Libya in late October and that more special forces are going in July to Libya?
[02:45:57.740 --> 02:45:59.740]  What have you heard about that?
[02:45:59.740 --> 02:46:01.300]  Hey, Alex.
[02:46:01.300 --> 02:46:08.420]  I can't confirm that yet, but I'm working down in Sancom under Sancom Command Army Central.
[02:46:08.420 --> 02:46:16.340]  It's I'm with the Mortuary Affairs section, but I get guys dying.
[02:46:16.340 --> 02:46:22.940]  You know, I'm tracking our dead fellow soldiers coming in from, you know, which country that
[02:46:22.940 --> 02:46:23.940]  they get killed.
[02:46:23.940 --> 02:46:30.780]  So I'm already tracking guys from coming from Libya that are, you know, already getting
[02:46:30.780 --> 02:46:31.780]  killed.
[02:46:31.780 --> 02:46:32.780]  So they're already there.
[02:46:32.780 --> 02:46:37.940]  How many, how many in your affairs department are and break down how those departments work
[02:46:37.940 --> 02:46:39.420]  for folks that don't know?
[02:46:39.420 --> 02:46:43.940]  You're the guy that has to make sure the family gets contacted, line up the benefits, line
[02:46:43.940 --> 02:46:47.100]  up the funeral, correct.
[02:46:47.100 --> 02:46:50.420]  And you're getting casualties already out of Libya.
[02:46:50.420 --> 02:46:51.420]  True.
[02:46:51.420 --> 02:46:52.420]  True, sir.
[02:46:52.420 --> 02:46:56.460]  That's why, you know, I was trying to get in contact to you because of the last time,
[02:46:56.460 --> 02:47:02.380]  you know, especially with the Bin Laden issue, you know, it's really crazy because it didn't
[02:47:02.380 --> 02:47:08.260]  go through my section, our section, especially, you know, it's under Sancom Command.
[02:47:08.260 --> 02:47:13.660]  You know, they killed them for, per se, they killed them, but, you know, it didn't go through
[02:47:13.660 --> 02:47:14.660]  us.
[02:47:14.660 --> 02:47:23.540]  But the issue being the us having soldiers already down there, you know, it's, I'm not
[02:47:23.540 --> 02:47:28.780]  sure yet how, what's the numbers, what's, what's the actual numbers that are on the
[02:47:28.780 --> 02:47:32.140]  ground down there in Libya.
[02:47:32.140 --> 02:47:39.420]  But, and then, you know, other issues that I'm getting chatter in the office is they,
[02:47:39.420 --> 02:47:42.020]  they're running out of BU.
[02:47:42.020 --> 02:47:48.220]  So you know, there were, I run in the office, they're going crazy because, you know, they're
[02:47:48.220 --> 02:47:54.340]  running out of depleted uranium to send out down to, you know, the Sancom Command.
[02:47:54.340 --> 02:47:58.740]  Well, look, look, look, look, there were US and British special forces confirmed in the
[02:47:58.740 --> 02:48:03.700]  month before they used the Al Qaeda forces in the east against the west against Qaddafi.
[02:48:03.700 --> 02:48:04.900]  That's been confirmed.
[02:48:04.900 --> 02:48:08.540]  They just claim now they're advisors, but they've been videotaped.
[02:48:08.540 --> 02:48:12.940]  What looks like pure mercs, they're not even in US military uniforms, but it's white guys
[02:48:12.940 --> 02:48:19.340]  up there and they know what they're doing, you can watch, obviously, Europeans or Americans.
[02:48:19.340 --> 02:48:23.340]  You also see folks that don't look Arabic, but have brown skin, probably Latin American,
[02:48:23.340 --> 02:48:24.620]  stock Americans.
[02:48:24.620 --> 02:48:29.260]  But whatever's going on, they admit it's, it's happening, just not details.
[02:48:29.260 --> 02:48:35.620]  What type of body count numbers are you seeing of US forces out of Libya?
[02:48:35.620 --> 02:48:39.460]  I got two soldiers and then three civilians.
[02:48:39.460 --> 02:48:48.660]  I am not really sure those three civilians are even Mercer, but for now I have seen on
[02:48:48.660 --> 02:48:51.940]  my tracker, I only seen two soldiers passed by.
[02:48:51.940 --> 02:48:56.580]  Would you see everything or do you just see people going to a certain region?
[02:48:56.580 --> 02:48:57.860]  I see everything.
[02:48:57.860 --> 02:49:04.180]  I see everything that, you know, that we get killed or our people that get killed down
[02:49:04.180 --> 02:49:05.180]  there.
[02:49:05.180 --> 02:49:12.620]  I see everything, especially if they passed by through our military affairs collection
[02:49:12.620 --> 02:49:13.620]  points.
[02:49:13.620 --> 02:49:19.740]  So three civilians and two military, were they army?
[02:49:19.740 --> 02:49:23.340]  Yes, sir, army.
[02:49:23.340 --> 02:49:27.780]  So but do you just see army or are you seeing joint forces?
[02:49:27.780 --> 02:49:31.660]  For now I see army, I haven't seen joint forces.
[02:49:31.660 --> 02:49:37.580]  Generally, in the total categories in CENTCOM, do you see army?
[02:49:37.580 --> 02:49:38.580]  We do have joint forces.
[02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:43.500]  Yes, we do have joint forces down there, but you know, like I said, you know, the body
[02:49:43.500 --> 02:49:47.980]  count that came in through my tracker is only two and then three civilians.
[02:49:47.980 --> 02:49:53.540]  I cannot confirm where the three civilians worked for, but you know, when they come through
[02:49:53.540 --> 02:50:00.660]  our collection points, when we package them up back to the states, you know, I see them.
[02:50:00.660 --> 02:50:02.900]  Are these wounds from combat?
[02:50:02.900 --> 02:50:07.380]  Yes, sir, bullet wounds, sir.
[02:50:07.380 --> 02:50:08.380]  Bullet wounds.
[02:50:08.380 --> 02:50:13.140]  Well, I tell you, only two dead does sound like they're actually just advisers because
[02:50:13.140 --> 02:50:16.300]  if they were frontline, wouldn't you imagine there'd be a lot more dead?
[02:50:16.300 --> 02:50:21.620]  I would imagine, sir, you know, my tracker would be, you know, busy if you know.
[02:50:21.620 --> 02:50:24.860]  What do you think of the overall intel we're getting that they're planning a full-scale
[02:50:24.860 --> 02:50:27.780]  ground invasion of Libya?
[02:50:27.780 --> 02:50:34.660]  I'm getting scared, too, sir, because like you said, you know, like they did in Afghanistan,
[02:50:34.660 --> 02:50:42.580]  they're lining the soldiers up to get ready, you know, to prepare for, you know, an attack
[02:50:42.580 --> 02:50:48.460]  down here in the states, and they'll say, you know, Gaddafi, we need to go in.
[02:50:48.460 --> 02:50:50.860]  So that's the thing I'm worried about.
[02:50:50.860 --> 02:50:56.780]  Are any of the other people or any other folks in CENTCOM concerned like you are?
[02:50:56.780 --> 02:50:57.780]  Yes, sir.
[02:50:57.780 --> 02:51:00.700]  I'm the one that's forcing out my vessel to do that.
[02:51:00.700 --> 02:51:01.700]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:51:01.700 --> 02:51:04.140]  Never buy home canning jar lids again.
[02:51:04.140 --> 02:51:05.140]  No kidding.
[02:51:05.140 --> 02:51:09.220]  When you buy Tadler Reusable canning lids once, you'll never buy canning lids ever again.
[02:51:09.220 --> 02:51:11.980]  Safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[02:51:11.980 --> 02:51:15.500]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways containing BPA.
[02:51:15.500 --> 02:51:19.580]  But Tadler Reusable canning lids are guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for

[02:52:01.020 --> 02:52:05.660]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:52:05.660 --> 02:52:09.980]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:52:09.980 --> 02:52:14.300]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:52:14.300 --> 02:52:15.620]  allows you to have.
[02:52:15.620 --> 02:52:21.340]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:52:21.340 --> 02:52:25.660]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:52:25.660 --> 02:52:29.660]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:52:29.660 --> 02:52:33.140]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:52:33.140 --> 02:52:36.860]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:52:36.860 --> 02:52:41.580]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:52:41.580 --> 02:52:45.380]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:52:45.380 --> 02:52:46.780]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:53:00.700 --> 02:53:05.420]  If you're concerned about radiation poisoning from Japan in the air, water or food and can't

[02:54:16.260 --> 02:54:22.820]  As that country goes under globalist austerity measures to pay every dime to the offshore
[02:54:22.820 --> 02:54:28.540]  banks that openly took the country over, part of the public record, Congress, prominent
[02:54:28.540 --> 02:54:31.860]  Republicans and Democrats are filing suit against the White House.
[02:54:31.860 --> 02:54:36.860]  They can just impeach Obama, forget a suit, saying that they've never been even told what's
[02:54:36.860 --> 02:54:42.500]  happening in the war, not even consulted and they will move to prohibit the White House
[02:54:42.500 --> 02:54:44.860]  from conducting a war without congressional approval.
[02:54:44.860 --> 02:54:49.620]  It's already prohibited, but they just do it and that's what's so dangerous.
[02:54:49.620 --> 02:54:52.660]  We have these rules in place for a reason, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:52.660 --> 02:54:55.700]  I want to go to Chris and Marilyn who's also the military but finishing up with Specialist
[02:54:55.700 --> 02:55:01.020]  H. I was asking if other folks are aware of what's happening.
[02:55:01.020 --> 02:55:05.220]  Is anybody concerned about Obama launching wars without even talking to Congress, which
[02:55:05.220 --> 02:55:06.220]  is illegal?
[02:55:06.220 --> 02:55:12.820]  A lot of people are concerned, sir, but they're still being apathetical what's happening
[02:55:12.820 --> 02:55:18.460]  right now in our country, especially this possible war with Libya.
[02:55:18.460 --> 02:55:25.180]  I know it's already going on myself, but there's nobody, even in our inner circle in the Army,
[02:55:25.180 --> 02:55:26.860]  nobody's voicing out their opinions.
[02:55:26.860 --> 02:55:29.860]  But the government says it's not a war.
[02:55:29.860 --> 02:55:33.740]  Was that a laugh for folks in Centcom that this is not a war?
[02:55:33.740 --> 02:55:34.740]  It's true, it's a laugh.
[02:55:34.740 --> 02:55:42.780]  It is really a laugh because people already are already dying and people just most hired
[02:55:42.780 --> 02:55:50.620]  NTOs and officers that I talk about this are just apathetic.
[02:55:50.620 --> 02:55:54.220]  They have that huge apathy all the way about it.
[02:55:54.220 --> 02:55:58.420]  That's why things are going to get a lot worse because people in charge just do whatever
[02:55:58.420 --> 02:56:02.580]  they're told and that's a recipe for Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia.
[02:56:02.580 --> 02:56:11.020]  Stay in touch, Specialist H, and then we're going to quickly go to Chris, but last question.
[02:56:11.020 --> 02:56:15.140]  We're starting to talk about folks not buying the bin Laden thing because Centcom knew nothing.
[02:56:15.140 --> 02:56:16.940]  I don't want to put words in your mouth.
[02:56:16.940 --> 02:56:20.340]  Did the military buy that fable?
[02:56:20.340 --> 02:56:22.260]  Most military bought that fable.
[02:56:22.260 --> 02:56:29.260]  I even voiced out loud in my unit, look, that guy didn't pass my tracker, didn't pass my
[02:56:29.260 --> 02:56:33.420]  section, especially the way they said they buried him at sea.
[02:56:33.420 --> 02:56:36.740]  I could pull out the book that were not allowed to do that.
[02:56:36.740 --> 02:56:44.860]  I don't know why most military bought that in the media, but most people knew that most
[02:56:44.860 --> 02:56:49.540]  of my leaders knew that he was dead a long time ago, but that's the only thing I hate
[02:56:49.540 --> 02:56:56.820]  about them because they're too scared to share their opinions and the truth of even though
[02:56:56.820 --> 02:56:59.580]  they have the facts, they can prove it.
[02:56:59.580 --> 02:57:01.100]  Very interesting special stage.
[02:57:01.100 --> 02:57:02.100]  Thank you.
[02:57:02.100 --> 02:57:03.100]  Be safe.
[02:57:03.100 --> 02:57:07.580]  I'm in the military, what's the word on bigger ground forces going into Libya?
[02:57:07.580 --> 02:57:08.580]  Have you heard anything on that?
[02:57:08.580 --> 02:57:09.580]  Yes, I did.
[02:57:09.580 --> 02:57:16.860]  I'm actually a former special operations and paramilitary contractor and everything you've
[02:57:16.860 --> 02:57:23.580]  said has been 100% accurate as far as the troops in Libya and special ops down there
[02:57:23.580 --> 02:57:26.820]  in Libya and Pakistan and stuff like that.
[02:57:26.820 --> 02:57:29.460]  Everything you've said so far has been 100% accurate.
[02:57:29.460 --> 02:57:37.500]  So you're just saying I'm accurate, you don't want to say it yourself, but the word is that
[02:57:37.500 --> 02:57:42.700]  1st Cavalry Division heavy armor and three corps deployed to Libya in late October.
[02:57:42.700 --> 02:57:47.660]  I heard September was the actual date when they're going to start moving troops over
[02:57:47.660 --> 02:57:48.660]  there.
[02:57:48.660 --> 02:57:57.380]  Yeah, this says late October and early November, and that's correct.
[02:57:57.380 --> 02:58:00.900]  And would they just be sending troops from Fort Hood or do you think three corps will
[02:58:00.900 --> 02:58:01.900]  do it?
[02:58:01.900 --> 02:58:07.300]  No, right now what they're doing right now, they're, I know they're using certain organizations
[02:58:07.300 --> 02:58:13.900]  to lay targets and stuff like that over there, they're going to start small and then go big.
[02:58:13.900 --> 02:58:17.980]  You know what, that's it for the main transmission, but at internetonlyinfowords.com, I got to
[02:58:17.980 --> 02:58:18.980]  go to overdrive.
[02:58:18.980 --> 02:58:21.940]  I want to get more information from you on this, we're obviously going to do a report
[02:58:21.940 --> 02:58:26.500]  because I have sources in the military, emails, it's all coming in and we're being told these
[02:58:26.500 --> 02:58:31.940]  months and it's so outrageous that Congress wasn't even consulted.
[02:58:31.940 --> 02:58:36.820]  Regardless of what you think of this new war, it is a war, the UN is the authority for it
[02:58:36.820 --> 02:58:37.820]  and that's treason.
[02:58:37.820 --> 02:58:38.820]  That's it for this transmission.
[02:58:38.820 --> 02:58:39.820]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:39.820 --> 02:58:40.820]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:40.820 --> 02:58:51.820]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:51.820 --> 02:58:59.900]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.900 --> 02:59:04.260]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[02:59:04.260 --> 02:59:05.260]  at home.
[02:59:05.260 --> 02:59:10.380]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress and they really are calling the
[02:59:10.380 --> 02:59:11.380]  shots.
[02:59:11.380 --> 02:59:16.220]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:59:16.220 --> 02:59:21.700]  The fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel
[02:59:21.700 --> 02:59:26.380]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:59:26.380 --> 02:59:30.740]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[02:59:30.740 --> 02:59:32.940]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.940 --> 02:59:38.980]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[02:59:38.980 --> 02:59:39.980]  the republic.
[02:59:39.980 --> 02:59:46.660]  Get your copy of fall of the republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now
[02:59:46.660 --> 03:00:14.940]  in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[03:00:17.500 --> 03:00:22.540]  The whole world is accelerating towards wider war and it's not a mistake that's happening
[03:00:22.540 --> 03:00:24.140]  during the depression.
[03:00:24.140 --> 03:00:25.780]  That's being done as a political diversion.
[03:00:25.780 --> 03:00:30.740]  They're hyping the daylights out of domestic terror attacks and that pro-patriot, pro-liberty
[03:00:30.740 --> 03:00:39.300]  people work with al-Qaeda, I mean that's like saying that LeBron James loves Cleveland.
[03:00:39.300 --> 03:00:46.380]  I mean it is a fraud and it doesn't matter, they're getting ready and they're going to
[03:00:46.380 --> 03:00:47.940]  go ahead with all this.
[03:00:47.940 --> 03:00:52.100]  We're here trying to warn people as best we can and folks you're not going to just sit
[03:00:52.100 --> 03:00:53.940]  out of this and not have it affect you.
[03:00:53.940 --> 03:00:58.060]  This is being done so the megabanks can rob the daylights out of you.
[03:00:58.060 --> 03:01:01.740]  So this means things are only going to get worse, we tried to stop it, we still might
[03:01:01.740 --> 03:01:03.700]  be able to but I doubt it.
[03:01:03.700 --> 03:01:07.380]  At least people are going to hear the truth when all this stuff unfolds and other we tried
[03:01:07.380 --> 03:01:08.380]  to warn them.
[03:01:08.380 --> 03:01:13.020]  Chris we've got about four minutes left, you've got the floor, your former special operations
[03:01:13.020 --> 03:01:17.860]  now a contractor and you're saying that everything, and that's just classic with somebody who's
[03:01:17.860 --> 03:01:24.020]  real, you're just saying well what you said is accurate, not wanting to come out himself
[03:01:24.020 --> 03:01:28.220]  and say it, but what else are you being told, I mean this is illegal and it doesn't mean
[03:01:28.220 --> 03:01:31.780]  they still couldn't try to go after folks for talking about it but it is illegal what's
[03:01:31.780 --> 03:01:36.060]  going on and Congress is moving to try to block this but they better move fast so they're
[03:01:36.060 --> 03:01:40.940]  planning to start slow like they always do and then build it up and tell us it's not
[03:01:40.940 --> 03:01:41.940]  a war.
[03:01:41.940 --> 03:01:43.940]  What can you tell us?
[03:01:43.940 --> 03:01:49.020]  It's not just Libya right now, there's a lot of other things going on and that was a part
[03:01:49.020 --> 03:01:54.860]  of certain things going on that may come to light within the next six months or so.
[03:01:54.860 --> 03:01:59.460]  Is that Yemen or is that people outside Iran?
[03:01:59.460 --> 03:02:05.780]  Can't say but you're good, you're accurate on that.
[03:02:05.780 --> 03:02:14.340]  Pretty much what we're doing right now is leading up to I guess you can say World War
[03:02:14.340 --> 03:02:22.060]  III, they're not calling it a war and my job feels but they are calling it just an occupation
[03:02:22.060 --> 03:02:27.700]  or over there doing a specific job and that's it, don't talk about it, we weren't allowed
[03:02:27.700 --> 03:02:36.220]  to listen to your show and I actually were woken up by you maybe seven months ago.
[03:02:36.220 --> 03:02:39.740]  Really so you're not allowed to listen to my show?
[03:02:39.740 --> 03:02:41.420]  No we're not.
[03:02:41.420 --> 03:02:45.660]  So what, you were in a foreign country or in country and people got caught listening
[03:02:45.660 --> 03:02:46.660]  to it?
[03:02:46.660 --> 03:02:50.940]  This was in country and overseas, Afghanistan.
[03:02:50.940 --> 03:02:54.500]  And what did they say, you don't listen to that traitor?
[03:02:54.500 --> 03:02:58.460]  Pretty much we were blocked from the website, we were not allowed to access your website
[03:02:58.460 --> 03:03:00.260]  and get information from it.
[03:03:00.260 --> 03:03:03.660]  But what's their story, how do they describe me?
[03:03:03.660 --> 03:03:10.020]  It's pretty much just propaganda or hatred and I didn't believe it so I checked it out
[03:03:10.020 --> 03:03:15.820]  for myself and well this guy actually is right but I guess they're using the same tactics
[03:03:15.820 --> 03:03:20.980]  that they use on Americans today.
[03:03:20.980 --> 03:03:25.060]  There's the same style they use on third world people, look here's the deal, when the history
[03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:28.060]  books are written it's going to be known America was taken over by traders.
[03:03:28.060 --> 03:03:32.020]  I want my private property, I want my guns, I don't want to give $27 trillion to a bunch
[03:03:32.020 --> 03:03:36.460]  of offshore crooks and I don't want to go take over countries for oil companies and
[03:03:36.460 --> 03:03:40.780]  it's that simple and I'm an American and the fact that, I don't want to go through all
[03:03:40.780 --> 03:03:47.220]  the stuff I've had to deal with this but the people in government that tell you that and
[03:03:47.220 --> 03:03:50.700]  were they telling you that with a straight face or those guys actually believe what they're
[03:03:50.700 --> 03:03:51.700]  saying?
[03:03:51.700 --> 03:03:56.260]  Oh yes, you pretty much get in trouble if you were caught listening to it or accessing
[03:03:56.260 --> 03:03:58.700]  the website.
[03:03:58.700 --> 03:04:03.280]  And they would say that guy's a, what a hater of America basically.
[03:04:03.280 --> 03:04:04.780]  Pretty much yes.
[03:04:04.780 --> 03:04:12.980]  And I recently left the military and got into paramilitary contracting and saw the things
[03:04:12.980 --> 03:04:17.060]  that were going on in that job field and decided to couldn't do it anymore, I'm married and
[03:04:17.060 --> 03:04:22.020]  had a kid on the way and it just wasn't the lifestyle that I wanted to live anymore so.
[03:04:22.020 --> 03:04:25.820]  Well I, what are you going to do when they start blowing stuff up and blaming it on
[03:04:25.820 --> 03:04:26.820]  us?
[03:04:26.820 --> 03:04:29.180]  I hope folks will stand up for me when they kill me.
[03:04:29.180 --> 03:04:35.940]  Oh yeah, I will Alex, I mean the whole 9-11 and you know that's a whole different story
[03:04:35.940 --> 03:04:40.260]  itself but like I said I love you Joe, you're 100% accurate on everything you say.
[03:04:40.260 --> 03:04:44.060]  We got a quick question, what about AFRICOM, is there a big move into Africa?
[03:04:44.060 --> 03:04:49.740]  Alex, we've been there for the past 6 years.
[03:04:49.740 --> 03:04:50.740]  Yep.
[03:04:50.740 --> 03:04:54.140]  Alright, God bless you, try to get back in soon, we need to do whole shows and we talk
[03:04:54.140 --> 03:04:55.140]  to the military.
[03:04:55.140 --> 03:04:59.220]  God bless you my friend, please spread the word, we've got a Nazi Germany situation
[03:04:59.220 --> 03:05:15.300]  on our hands.
