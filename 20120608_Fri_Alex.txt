[00:35.120 --> 00:43.760]  of any propaganda rolling across the picket line lay down you saw all through
[00:43.760 --> 00:47.800]  the 20th century and now in the 21st century it's time to stand up and realize

[00:51.680 --> 00:56.160]  not submit to dehumanization I don't know about you but I'm concerned with
[00:56.160 --> 00:59.600]  what's happening in this world I'm concerned with the structure I'm
[00:59.600 --> 01:03.440]  concerned with the systems of control those that control my life and those
[01:03.440 --> 01:08.640]  that seek to control me even more I want freedom that's what I want and that's
[01:08.640 --> 01:12.720]  what you should want it's up to each and every one of us to turn this into some

[01:17.280 --> 01:22.720]  central mode of control make us feel small so we'll willingly give up our
[01:22.720 --> 01:27.760]  sovereignty our liberty our destiny we have got to realize that we're being

[02:02.680 --> 02:06.560]  truth is out there in front of you but they lay out this buffet of lies I'm
[02:06.560 --> 02:11.520]  sick of it and I'm not gonna take a fight out of it do you got me
[02:11.520 --> 02:18.360]  human kind is too good we're not a bunch of underachievers we're gonna stand up
[02:18.360 --> 02:24.720]  and we're gonna be human beings the things that matter creativity and the
[02:24.720 --> 02:29.680]  dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit well that's it that's all I got
[02:29.680 --> 02:35.000]  to say it's in your court the modeling program is brought to you in living
[02:35.000 --> 02:49.120]  color Kennedy died our future presentation
[02:54.720 --> 02:59.560]  every day our senses are being constantly bombarded by subliminal
[02:59.560 --> 03:06.520]  messages that are found in TV movies and advertisements the subliminal messages
[03:06.520 --> 03:11.280]  we are subjected to are unrecognizable by the conscious mind and only
[03:11.280 --> 03:17.960]  recognizable in our subconscious mind the messages and imagery are passively
[03:17.960 --> 03:22.920]  absorbed and then stored in our subconscious we're propagandist
[03:22.920 --> 03:27.120]  deliberately implant artificial thoughts which in turn can affect our
[03:27.120 --> 03:31.920]  actions and attitudes later in life
[03:41.400 --> 03:45.840]  experiments have shown that less than one minute after the viewer begins to
[03:45.840 --> 03:50.720]  watch television the brain switches from beta level consciousness associated
[03:50.720 --> 03:55.880]  with active and logical thought to alpha level which is associated with passive
[03:55.880 --> 04:00.840]  acceptance and suggestibility this is why advertisers spend billions of
[04:00.840 --> 04:05.960]  dollars a year on commercials as well as product placement within TV shows
[04:05.960 --> 04:11.960]  political messages are implanted in fictional TV programs as the relaxed
[04:11.960 --> 04:17.280]  meditative state of the viewer is receptive to the programming one example
[04:17.280 --> 04:23.320]  is AMC's breaking bad television series as it depicts a meth villain as a Ron
[04:23.320 --> 04:27.480]  Paul supporter I looked them up it's one of these physicists one Hitler's guys
[04:27.480 --> 04:33.320]  he's a physicist named Bairner Heisenberg in a basic college level
[04:33.320 --> 04:39.040]  marketing class in your first year of radio television film at least for me
[04:39.040 --> 04:42.320]  and then I've seen some other textbooks and curriculum and found it's also a
[04:42.320 --> 04:48.120]  nose but but but most RTF schooling teaches you that they have had subliminals
[04:48.120 --> 04:53.760]  for at least 70 years in the United States and Europe and so yes there is
[04:53.760 --> 04:59.840]  subliminal messaging everywhere it is all over the place

[08:00.000 --> 08:05.600]  the genesis communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[08:05.600 --> 08:10.160]  because there's a war on for your mind
[08:16.160 --> 08:23.640]  welcome my friends it is Friday June 8th 2012 I'm your host Alex Jones and
[08:23.640 --> 08:28.920]  we're going to be live here for the next three hours today again thank you so
[08:28.920 --> 08:36.600]  much for joining us well where to begin you've noticed that I've been somewhat
[08:36.600 --> 08:42.200]  silent about Ron Paul and his campaign the last few months because I could read
[08:42.200 --> 08:47.720]  the tea leaves and tell where all of this was headed and going and I was just
[08:47.720 --> 08:54.840]  going to wait to watch it unfold before commenting because I've learned that
[08:54.840 --> 09:01.600]  people who were totally dedicated to something and who then will perceive a
[09:01.600 --> 09:11.120]  betrayal do not want to hear it early they want to be betrayed where it's
[09:11.120 --> 09:14.920]  completely clear out in the open and I thought I would stay out of the way of
[09:14.920 --> 09:22.920]  that disaster that said I think Ron Paul is a good person and has a great
[09:22.920 --> 09:27.280]  voting record senator Rand Paul is a great person and has a very good voting
[09:27.280 --> 09:32.800]  record I understand the politics they're involved in and people who love
[09:32.800 --> 09:37.880]  Dr. No Ron Paul's nickname for voting no on almost everything need to understand
[09:37.880 --> 09:44.760]  that now there's massive political capital locked up inside of Ron Paul and
[09:44.760 --> 09:50.280]  Rand Paul and that now they have literally more than 30 40 million
[09:50.280 --> 09:56.200]  Americans behind them and from Ron Paul's perspective and Rand Paul's
[09:56.200 --> 10:01.480]  perspective if they don't work through the Republican Party that entire
[10:01.480 --> 10:09.200]  movement will just dissipate into space I'm not saying I agree with that I'm not
[10:09.200 --> 10:14.640]  saying I totally disagree with that but I historically have a pretty good
[10:14.640 --> 10:18.360]  understanding of how this is going to end up and so I'm going to tell you today
[10:18.360 --> 10:23.200]  where all this is going to go on record I have told Richard Reeves and other big
[10:23.200 --> 10:27.040]  Ron Paul supporters in our office that hey Ron Paul is great he exposes the
[10:27.040 --> 10:32.360]  private fellow reserve he exposes how big money and and and and taxation gets
[10:32.360 --> 10:39.280]  transferred in corporate welfare but I said get ready he will never use those
[10:39.280 --> 10:46.360]  delegates to try to challenge Mitt Romney because Paul understands that the
[10:46.360 --> 10:51.880]  media would spin it that Ron Paul was trying to steal an election and I said
[10:51.880 --> 10:56.440]  please to my crew and everybody else who was all lined up shocked this morning
[10:56.440 --> 11:01.000]  saying you're right you're right I said hey there's no point in doing 500 Ron
[11:01.000 --> 11:04.960]  Paul packages a week there's no point in loosely covering it because it's going
[11:04.960 --> 11:11.400]  to be a train wreck this is what is going to happen well exactly what I said is
[11:11.400 --> 11:15.880]  now happening and it's not because I'm a rocket scientist it's because I live in
[11:15.880 --> 11:28.720]  the real world now if you go to info wars.com you can see the news article
[11:28.720 --> 11:36.440]  that Paul Watson has done a balanced focused report Ron Paul supporters to
[11:36.440 --> 11:41.160]  cry Rand's endorsement of Romney majority accused Kentucky senator of
[11:41.160 --> 11:48.240]  shelling out to Republican establishment now what's happened is Ron Paul is
[11:48.240 --> 11:53.520]  preparing to recede and Rand Paul is going to be making all the announcements
[11:53.520 --> 11:57.840]  Rand Paul is going to be the big speaker at the RNC that's the plan not
[11:57.840 --> 12:01.840]  Ron Paul Rand Paul may still be offered to VP
[12:01.840 --> 12:07.200]  slot with Mitt Romney that's what's really going on here now I want to be
[12:07.200 --> 12:13.320]  clear I still deserve judgment on all of this I understand the thought
[12:13.320 --> 12:18.480]  processes of Ron Paul and Rand Paul and the people advising them I understand
[12:18.480 --> 12:24.240]  the process they're looking at tens of millions of awake Americans they're
[12:24.240 --> 12:27.320]  looking at the fact that the Republican establishment stole Iowa
[12:27.320 --> 12:33.240]  stalled Maine stole Nevada they know how the media works they're not ever going
[12:33.240 --> 12:36.080]  to be able to get that message out even when the New York Times came out and
[12:36.080 --> 12:43.600]  said yeah Ron Paul really won these states the system even itself admitted
[12:43.600 --> 12:48.640]  that that happened you noticed that Ron Paul did not come out and make a big
[12:48.640 --> 12:52.080]  issue out of it because he understood that it would be spun that he was
[12:52.080 --> 13:00.000]  basically a sore loser and I'm going to shoot a special video after the show
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.360]  today that will air on the nightly news where I'm going to directly address
[13:03.360 --> 13:08.600]  Ron Paul but I've been exhausted from the trip being out of town at Bilderberg
[13:08.600 --> 13:13.360]  I've been going to bed at about nine o'clock at night and so I missed the
[13:13.360 --> 13:16.600]  announcement last night and only got it this morning when Aaron Dyches was
[13:16.600 --> 13:21.200]  calling me at about 7 a.m. when I woke up I ended up getting about four hours
[13:21.200 --> 13:25.680]  sleep at night at Bilderberg and so I'm simply recharging my batteries when I
[13:25.680 --> 13:30.080]  actually go to bed early at night that's that's an Alex Jones vacation and I
[13:30.080 --> 13:39.080]  got up and I just knew all this was coming and it's going to be very very
[13:39.080 --> 13:48.680]  destructive at one level and it's going to be very disillusioning at another and
[13:48.680 --> 13:52.400]  I don't think it has to be that way I mean I've said over and over again on
[13:52.400 --> 13:55.920]  error people are like why aren't you covering the delegate process more I've
[13:55.920 --> 13:59.680]  said well he's not getting anywhere near a majority of delegates right at about
[13:59.680 --> 14:04.920]  20% and if he goes and tries to contest things it's going to be spun that he's
[14:04.920 --> 14:10.240]  going against what the majority wanted even if they originally stole it from
[14:10.240 --> 14:15.840]  him early on and I don't see Ron Paul doing that I see them trying to get some
[14:15.840 --> 14:20.360]  things into the platform which can be ignored and are ignored I see maybe a
[14:20.360 --> 14:25.360]  cabinet position for Ron Paul or a VP for Rand and I've said that six months
[14:25.360 --> 14:30.840]  ago and that's what's being jockeyed for here right now and so I'm open minded on
[14:30.840 --> 14:34.720]  this I know my gut doesn't like it but I'm saying okay does Ron Paul just fade
[14:34.720 --> 14:40.160]  off we just have the Kentucky senator Rand Paul up there does Ron Paul come
[14:40.160 --> 14:45.520]  out and say he doesn't like Mitt Romney and then general Republicans remember
[14:45.520 --> 14:49.440]  this isn't three or four years ago this is now with everybody hating Obama all
[14:49.440 --> 14:53.800]  the hate being on Obama Obama being revealed as a globalist that hasn't been
[14:53.800 --> 14:58.600]  fully revealed yet with Mitt Romney it's the season of hating Obama and so a lot
[14:58.600 --> 15:03.240]  of people are getting behind Mitt Romney just because they had Obama like a lot
[15:03.240 --> 15:08.680]  of people got behind Obama just because they hated George W. Bush and I had to
[15:08.680 --> 15:12.240]  be there to say no Obama's bought and paid for by the very same special
[15:12.240 --> 15:16.520]  interest as Bush he will expand the police state the wars the warrantless
[15:16.520 --> 15:21.320]  spying the secret arrest the torture he'll keep Gitmo open he'll hire nothing
[15:21.320 --> 15:25.640]  but lobbyist he'll be more secretive all of that happened I made the Obama
[15:25.640 --> 15:30.520]  deception while he was president-elect it came out in early March just a few
[15:30.520 --> 15:34.640]  months after he was in office and it is like you're watching someone who got in
[15:34.640 --> 15:41.720]  a time machine and predicted exactly what would happen so now I need to come
[15:41.720 --> 15:46.440]  out I guess with a film called the left-right deception or the Republican
[15:46.440 --> 15:49.360]  Democrat deception by the way Jesse Ventura is giving us one of the first
[15:49.360 --> 15:54.520]  interviews a full hour on Tuesday this officially comes out Monday but you can
[15:54.520 --> 16:02.520]  order it now at info wars.com it's a Democrypse and Rebluplicans he told me
[16:02.520 --> 16:05.720]  this name about a year ago when he started writing it and Ventura's new
[16:05.720 --> 16:11.160]  book get it first discounted at info wars.com this is really the issue if you
[16:11.160 --> 16:15.200]  just attack Obama people think you hate black people if you just attack Mitt
[16:15.200 --> 16:20.160]  Romney they think oh my gosh you must be an insider commie no both of them are
[16:20.160 --> 16:26.160]  main capital Goldman Sachs Wells Fargo it's the same deal and it's just gangs
[16:26.160 --> 16:33.240]  that get together in their big commission meetings and scam the American
[16:33.240 --> 16:36.720]  people and if you do get up to the top and don't follow orders you get
[16:36.720 --> 16:40.960]  Kennedy or you get politically destroyed and undoubtedly a Bilderberg we're
[16:40.960 --> 16:44.760]  talking about wanting to kill Ron Paul at the Bilderberg meeting according to
[16:44.760 --> 16:48.800]  Tucker and other sources we have our other sources didn't confirm this about
[16:48.800 --> 16:52.200]  wanting to kill him and his supporters they confirm they were cussing Ron Paul
[16:52.200 --> 16:56.840]  and and sheing those out there protesting him as the bad guys Ron Paul spearheaded
[16:56.840 --> 17:00.240]  exposing the New World Order Ron Paul spearheaded exposing the Federal
[17:00.240 --> 17:07.240]  Reserve and now Ron Paul and the Liberty Movement through Ron and Ron has
[17:07.240 --> 17:12.080]  all this incredible political capital and so looking through Ron Paul and Ron
[17:12.080 --> 17:17.760]  Paul's eyes do they try to get Rand positioned in four years to run and
[17:17.760 --> 17:21.840]  win as president or do they get him in there as vice president or a cabinet
[17:21.840 --> 17:29.200]  position that's the idea how do they take that giant grassroots capital and how
[17:29.200 --> 17:33.360]  do they take over the Republican Party well I'll say this and I'm not somebody
[17:33.360 --> 17:38.800]  who yells at people who are in the arena but it's almost like their sabotage in
[17:38.800 --> 17:42.480]  there the way this stuff is announced the way they came out and said hey we're
[17:42.480 --> 17:46.240]  gonna stop campaigning in these states and then spun it that they didn't mean
[17:46.240 --> 17:50.280]  it like that that the campaign was still going so the message was yeah Romney
[17:50.280 --> 17:55.320]  we're quietly conceding to you but hey supporters keep giving us money and get
[17:55.320 --> 17:58.600]  out there and get us the delegates because we're still gonna win and I was
[17:58.600 --> 18:01.440]  like that's what I don't like if you want to know what I don't like and I'm
[18:01.440 --> 18:05.320]  gonna talk about this more today it's that politics was played with the
[18:05.320 --> 18:10.920]  constitutionalist libertarian americana patriot movement and I sat there and I
[18:10.920 --> 18:15.040]  watched it and I said is that Jesse Benton I mean and I said you know Jesse's
[18:15.040 --> 18:19.720]  not a bad guy but I said this really stinks and I just wouldn't talk I just
[18:19.720 --> 18:24.880]  went into a neutral mode and I had Salon and Washington Post and all them out
[18:24.880 --> 18:28.840]  there asking me about this at Bilderberg and I just said no Ron Paul ran Paul good
[18:28.840 --> 18:34.320]  and I and I said I gotta sit here and watch now now right now the jury's
[18:34.320 --> 18:40.040]  still out and I'm watching this and I'm understanding their thought processes but
[18:40.040 --> 18:44.760]  I don't agree with it because because there's no way Mitt Romney's gonna bring
[18:44.760 --> 18:49.920]  Rand Paul in or Ron Paul in and let them actually go against the globalist
[18:49.920 --> 18:54.640]  agenda this is a one-way street the rhetoric may be that oh yes you're
[18:54.640 --> 18:59.320]  influencing us and I talked to high level Republicans in the media over the
[18:59.320 --> 19:02.440]  weekend I'll just leave it at that when I was in Virginia went out to dinner with
[19:02.440 --> 19:07.880]  some and they said listen yeah Ron Paul ought to try to influence Mitt he's got
[19:07.880 --> 19:13.560]  a lot of good ideas and where do you stand on this you know Rand Paul Ron
[19:13.560 --> 19:21.440]  Paul you're not the only ones that are taken up on the mountain and again I'm
[19:21.440 --> 19:25.040]  not even saying that the people up on the mountain in every case or at the top
[19:25.040 --> 19:28.920]  of the mountain up there with L Diablo this is how politics works this is how
[19:28.920 --> 19:34.560]  people get sold out one inch at a time I got a bunch of notes here I wrote right
[19:34.560 --> 19:37.680]  before I went live on air I thought about this a lot this morning but I got
[19:37.680 --> 19:40.440]  to go with my gut here and tell you what I really think about all this so call
[19:40.440 --> 19:44.280]  everybody you know tell them tune in right now let's not let the fact that
[19:44.280 --> 19:47.920]  you know Ron Paul's been a big victory a big spearhead for us to fight the
[19:47.920 --> 19:51.520]  globalist the banksters the New World Order the Fella Reserve the Law of the
[19:51.520 --> 19:57.160]  Sea Treaty the UN the Rockefellers but hey ideas are bigger than Ron Paul and
[19:57.160 --> 20:00.600]  Rand Paul so I'm gonna keep going the same direction against the New World
[20:00.600 --> 20:04.920]  Order I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating I
[20:04.920 --> 20:08.720]  was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was

[20:12.480 --> 20:17.240]  and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating

[24:08.200 --> 24:14.600]  pretender what if I say I will never surrender that's the big question here
[24:14.600 --> 24:21.800]  again the jury is out on Ron Paul and Rand Paul I think joining with Romney
[24:21.800 --> 24:32.600]  openly and not challenging him as they do Obama will hurt the legacy of Ron Paul
[24:32.600 --> 24:38.800]  and Ron and Rand Paul there is no doubt in my mind politically that if Rand Paul
[24:38.800 --> 24:44.640]  stuck to his guns and behaved in the exact manner of his father that he would
[24:44.640 --> 24:49.640]  end up being a super dominant force in the next election and if he challenged
[24:49.640 --> 24:53.600]  election fraud in the states when it happened in Iowa and Maine like it
[24:53.600 --> 24:57.760]  happened this year and if he got really aggressive and built a movement over
[24:57.760 --> 25:05.000]  four years he could be a bully pulpit in the Senate and absolutely dominate and
[25:05.000 --> 25:10.800]  block legislation and promote legislation and he could end up being the
[25:10.800 --> 25:14.320]  president of the United States and pulling this republic out of where it's
[25:14.320 --> 25:19.040]  going but I'll tell you this if he supports Romney and gets a speaking
[25:19.040 --> 25:24.520]  slot or a cabinet position or his dad does when Romney betrays the American
[25:24.520 --> 25:30.000]  people just like Obama's done and tries to have amnesty and tries to have
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.280]  socialist health care and tries to have gun control and tries to have carbon
[25:34.280 --> 25:39.280]  taxes everything he supported before he ran for president remember Ron Paul has
[25:39.280 --> 25:44.480]  run TV ads about this all the flip-flopping he's bought and paid
[25:44.480 --> 25:50.440]  for by Bain Capital he's bought and paid for by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan do I
[25:50.440 --> 25:57.920]  dislike Romney no seems like a funny charming guy Obama seems like a funny
[25:57.920 --> 26:02.320]  charming guy at certain levels their teleprompter readers their high level
[26:02.320 --> 26:06.200]  minions of the New World Order so all of this is a distraction and a diversion
[26:06.200 --> 26:11.280]  that's why Ron Paul was different was because he was addressing the banksters
[26:11.280 --> 26:15.480]  the crony capitalists who were anti-free market he was bypassing their system and
[26:15.480 --> 26:20.040]  folks he was winning the first primaries that's why the polls showed him first in
[26:20.040 --> 26:25.840]  Maine first in Iowa and then it was stolen they caught them stealing it
[26:25.840 --> 26:29.720]  they wouldn't count the precincts where he was winning even the New York Times
[26:29.720 --> 26:38.000]  had to admit he really won main and now we see Rand coming out and saying well I
[26:38.000 --> 26:44.080]  always supported my father but now I support Mitt Romney and I understand
[26:44.080 --> 26:47.880]  why they're doing that I know Rand Paul personally I've known Ron Paul for 17
[26:47.880 --> 26:52.440]  years they're good people who who you see on TV is who they are behind the
[26:52.440 --> 26:57.400]  scenes they're good people but they've been too close to the beltway too long
[26:57.400 --> 27:00.920]  and they have this idea of let's not lose this political capital let's take
[27:00.920 --> 27:05.880]  over the Republican Party that's not what happened and all of your supporters
[27:05.880 --> 27:09.400]  I knew you were going to do this and I warned you guys through back channels
[27:09.400 --> 27:14.600]  not to do it I warned through your family not to do it you think you're
[27:14.600 --> 27:18.360]  going to go in there and influence it it doesn't matter because the main body of
[27:18.360 --> 27:25.400]  your supporters as you can see again I waited for this to happen the main body
[27:25.400 --> 27:32.920]  of your supporters feel totally and completely 110% betrayed especially when
[27:32.920 --> 27:38.520]  Ron Paul says go to Tampa and be respectful because Ron Paul people when
[27:38.520 --> 27:42.360]  they're the majority of the delegates the Republican leadership in Louisiana
[27:42.360 --> 27:46.560]  and other states is taking it saying no we say the delegates go for Romney so
[27:46.560 --> 27:49.960]  there's that stealing going on and they're beating up and arresting the
[27:49.960 --> 27:54.680]  Ron Paul supporters and Ron Paul comes out and puts it on the supporters and
[27:54.680 --> 27:59.720]  says you need to be respectful that's the reason I'm being somewhat critical
[27:59.720 --> 28:03.960]  today that's the straw that broke the camel's back and I better watch it or
[28:03.960 --> 28:08.640]  I'm gonna start saying more right here forget trying to influence Romney to be
[28:08.640 --> 28:12.400]  a constitutionalist how about we influence Ron Paul and Ron Paul to be
[28:12.400 --> 28:17.120]  constitutionalist how about you listen to your supporters and not Jesse Benton
[28:17.120 --> 28:22.280]  and I'm not saying Jesse Benton's the bad guy here but let me tell you I've
[28:22.280 --> 28:28.400]  been around it for six years and Jesse Benton shouldn't be the tail wagon the
[28:28.400 --> 28:35.080]  dog the first Rand Paul supporters were my radio show the first people in his
[28:35.080 --> 28:39.880]  campaign when no one was there it was grassroots were my listeners I've met
[28:39.880 --> 28:45.080]  them I've had dinner with them his had people and they said what do you think
[28:45.080 --> 28:50.200]  about what's happening you know and I said let's wait and see and I know Rand
[28:50.200 --> 28:57.120]  and Ron are good people they're good people and they've got great voting
[28:57.120 --> 29:02.480]  records but I'm not gonna sit here and watch this seduction of the Paul
[29:02.480 --> 29:08.280]  campaign and family without saying hey we don't just go wherever you go you need
[29:08.280 --> 29:16.080]  to understand that okay we're not here to be sold into Republican slavery just
[29:16.080 --> 29:19.320]  because you feel like it and you guys are all getting heady in meetings with
[29:19.320 --> 29:23.880]  Mitt Romney and have diluted yourselves that you're just gonna be able to you
[29:23.880 --> 29:27.880]  know go in there and influence them I'm gonna reserve total judgment on this and
[29:27.880 --> 29:33.400]  I'm gonna get more into this when we come back but down the road we're not
[29:33.400 --> 29:39.920]  gonna forget if if if Romney gets in and then there's a bunch of you know Rand
[29:39.920 --> 29:44.640]  Paul defending him stuff when he's doing wrong I'm gonna come after you so be
[29:44.640 --> 29:48.840]  aware of that and understand that's the case you understand we'll be right back
[29:48.840 --> 29:54.240]  I'm gonna give the number out we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex

[30:23.240 --> 30:28.000]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.800]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[30:31.800 --> 30:35.400]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[33:16.800 --> 33:20.640]  early leader the media said he couldn't win they stole the early states from
[33:20.640 --> 33:25.120]  them and I was critical of the fact that Ron Paul didn't make a bigger deal out
[33:25.120 --> 33:28.720]  of that but I understand the strategy if you sit there and talk about proven
[33:28.720 --> 33:33.760]  election fraud it sounds like you're a sore loser I know that Rand was on with
[33:33.760 --> 33:37.960]  us a few months ago and said that he had not talked to Romney had not heard
[33:37.960 --> 33:43.240]  about it that it was just speculation now he has met with him and I would just
[33:43.240 --> 33:48.120]  like to see Rand Paul and Ron Paul address this is my biggest concern here
[33:48.120 --> 33:52.360]  this is what really makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up that it's
[33:52.360 --> 34:00.760]  always announced on Sean Hannity that oh by the way I'm endorsing I'm endorsing
[34:00.760 --> 34:07.600]  Mitt Romney and then Ron Paul is out there saying now be respectful at the
[34:07.600 --> 34:11.920]  Tampa meeting I mean I thought we were supposed to get the delegates and go
[34:11.920 --> 34:15.760]  take over I told everybody internally I said they are not going to do that that
[34:15.760 --> 34:20.160]  is political suicide people are like you'll see Alex you'll see I'm like
[34:20.160 --> 34:25.320]  really I'll see I've been on air 17 years I happen to know a thing or two you
[34:25.320 --> 34:29.320]  know I always underestimate what I know and then I look at people who know
[34:29.320 --> 34:34.840]  nothing always lecturing me all day and it really gets old you know I was
[34:34.840 --> 34:39.960]  meeting with a high-level Republican this weekend and you know nice guy means
[34:39.960 --> 34:45.760]  well has done some good work and he's like well look you know Obama's really
[34:45.760 --> 34:51.040]  bad I mean I know it's not perfect but Obama is really bad you know
[34:51.040 --> 34:55.840]  reeducation centers and I go yeah but it's this whole continuity of government
[34:55.840 --> 35:00.400]  isn't just the Democratic Party and and Mr. Ayers or you know people like that
[35:00.400 --> 35:05.640]  of Chicago it's the big special interest everything Bush did Obama continued
[35:05.640 --> 35:10.720]  everything Clinton did Bush continued and there's still well the public wants
[35:10.720 --> 35:15.520]  to change and I understand the momentum of Obama's now been demonized he's
[35:15.520 --> 35:21.360]  yesterday's you know lunch he's rotten in the refrigerator his political
[35:21.360 --> 35:25.800]  capital is going down by the second he is a negative and here comes Mitt Romney
[35:25.800 --> 35:32.160]  and you want to believe you want to believe things could change and I told
[35:32.160 --> 35:40.200]  the Republican high-level national journalist I said you mark my words you
[35:40.200 --> 35:45.360]  mark my words Mitt Romney if he gets in is going to continue everything Obama has
[35:45.360 --> 35:49.560]  done except for stuff like gay marriage political football issues and that may
[35:49.560 --> 35:55.560]  matter to you individually okay the other culture wars and I'm not saying
[35:55.560 --> 35:59.640]  it's not important from both sides perspectives but it is shoved out there
[35:59.640 --> 36:03.320]  to distract the fact that both parties at the top are supporting bailouts
[36:03.320 --> 36:08.520]  corporate welfare new wars police state and overall entitlement programs are
[36:08.520 --> 36:16.200]  only getting bigger so it's an extremely complex issue and I'm not
[36:16.200 --> 36:22.920]  spinning I'm trying to despend this but I understand why the Paul family is
[36:22.920 --> 36:27.200]  doing what they're doing they're going to see their political dynasty that has
[36:27.200 --> 36:32.400]  done so much good that's forming dissipate by a factor of I'd say 80% in
[36:32.400 --> 36:39.800]  their view if they don't try to merge with a Republican party but isn't that
[36:39.800 --> 36:45.400]  to a great extent what Barry Goldwater did and he just kind of faded off I mean
[36:45.400 --> 36:50.680]  Rand Paul he's going to be remembered in history and have an effect if he
[36:50.680 --> 36:56.120]  doesn't compromise it was the system's dirty tricks Republican and Democrat
[36:56.120 --> 37:00.360]  that tried to keep him out of office in Kentucky that galvanized people behind
[37:00.360 --> 37:03.960]  him I mean I had ran Paul on a year before he ran when they were just
[37:03.960 --> 37:07.280]  talking about it I said you will win it will happen you've got to get everybody
[37:07.280 --> 37:10.920]  behind you you've got to announce early and my I said that's it listener
[37:10.920 --> 37:18.560]  sending money Ron Paul said in 2008 on this show that half the support he had
[37:18.560 --> 37:22.080]  gotten in the campaign that far along you can pull the interview up came from
[37:22.080 --> 37:30.480]  this radio show and so I have a responsibility here I have a responsibility
[37:30.480 --> 37:33.960]  here to talk about these issues and tell you what I'm thinking and the answer
[37:33.960 --> 37:38.520]  is I'm not sure I want we had Ward Moncton on the second hour today from
[37:38.520 --> 37:41.640]  Hawaii with big breaking news I moved him to the third hour so we'd have a
[37:41.640 --> 37:46.560]  chance to talk to you and I want to hear your points on this where do you see
[37:46.560 --> 37:50.180]  this going we should have had this debate earlier but it was just such
[37:50.180 --> 37:54.480]  mindless victory all of you watch we're gonna win we're gonna get the delegates
[37:54.480 --> 37:58.720]  from the listeners that I didn't want to you know rain on your parade I just said
[37:58.720 --> 38:05.600]  I even prayed about it and said I hope I'm wrong I I I hope this doesn't go the
[38:05.600 --> 38:09.440]  way I see it and and that didn't even mean Rand Paul running as vice president
[38:09.440 --> 38:13.680]  Rand Paul getting a cabinet position or Ron Paul or the speaking engagement there
[38:13.680 --> 38:18.320]  which is a clear set deal big speaking you know at the RNC selling out for a
[38:18.320 --> 38:22.520]  bowl of porridge I mean this is nothing that will discredit them when they're
[38:22.520 --> 38:28.640]  brought out and and and and worship by Mitt Romney see I've been all over the
[38:28.640 --> 38:34.800]  country in the last year or so and I've seen zero Mitt Romney stickers Richard
[38:34.800 --> 38:39.880]  Reeves who drives constantly he saw one in North Dallas a few months ago I
[38:39.880 --> 38:47.180]  still see ridiculous moron Obama stickers all over the country I see 10%
[38:47.180 --> 38:50.400]  of what I saw three years ago but three years ago they were festooning
[38:50.400 --> 38:54.600]  everything as if it was the second coming of Christ or something and just
[38:54.600 --> 38:59.120]  gullible morons and I'm sorry I just can't be a a sucker a schmuck an idiot a
[38:59.120 --> 39:06.480]  dupe a useful moron an idiot I mean I I just I can't stand it now I want to
[39:06.480 --> 39:14.360]  believe that Mitt Romney patting Ron Paul and patting Rand on the head means
[39:14.360 --> 39:19.160]  he he wants to be a good guy but that's all politics I want to believe him saying
[39:19.160 --> 39:22.480]  he supports the Second Amendment is against Obamacare and against carbon
[39:22.480 --> 39:27.280]  taxes I want to believe that that's the truth I want this nightmare to end I
[39:27.280 --> 39:33.480]  want things to start reversing I told the big Republican journalist I said
[39:33.480 --> 39:40.360]  look in an off-record meeting I said I would passively not attack Mitt Romney
[39:40.360 --> 39:45.840]  as as much if he would just reverse 20% I mean if we could just not go
[39:45.840 --> 39:50.480]  directly off the cliff if the TSA stop going down our pants if they didn't you
[39:50.480 --> 39:54.100]  know increase some and if he didn't do carbon taxes but I said you mark my
[39:54.100 --> 40:00.520]  words when he gets in there they're gonna launch more wars more police state
[40:00.520 --> 40:06.160]  all sorts of weird tricks Romney loves tricks dressing up as policemen his life
[40:06.160 --> 40:09.760]  pulling people over doing weird stuff I mean let me tell you it's gonna get
[40:09.760 --> 40:13.440]  weird it's gonna get strange and it's gonna get just as bad or worse with
[40:13.440 --> 40:20.120]  Obama I understand that but wouldn't it be better to have Obama in because we
[40:20.120 --> 40:23.800]  know he's evil everybody's already woken up he's a piece of garbage most
[40:23.800 --> 40:27.720]  people they know he's a puppet they know he's a liar instead of a new puppet I
[40:27.720 --> 40:33.800]  mean worse is better sometimes and I'm not gonna support Obama I cannot support
[40:33.800 --> 40:39.840]  Mitt Romney because just because he says he supports the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[40:39.840 --> 40:46.760]  just because he says that he is now reversing himself from all of his voting
[40:46.760 --> 40:50.600]  record as governor and all of his I mean I've got videos of him saying I support
[40:50.600 --> 40:55.160]  abortion because my mother did and I'll always support it and then now he says
[40:55.160 --> 40:59.080]  he's against it I mean he was for abortion in Massachusetts he was for
[40:59.080 --> 41:04.360]  open borders he was for carbon taxes he was for he wrote the model of the
[41:04.360 --> 41:09.400]  healthcare we're now under of course big insurance company scam to make 35
[41:09.400 --> 41:12.680]  million people buy insurance and now insurance companies can control the care
[41:12.680 --> 41:19.920]  you get that's a death panel and let me tell you Mitt Romney gets in that's why
[41:19.920 --> 41:23.160]  the globalist more and more are going for Romney I see political coming out
[41:23.160 --> 41:26.800]  against Obama I see the Washington Post kind of bad now that Obama they're
[41:26.800 --> 41:30.400]  turning against Obama right now because they go oh my gosh he was gonna be our
[41:30.400 --> 41:34.600]  man but it didn't work put Romney in that'll make the libertarians and
[41:34.600 --> 41:39.120]  conservatives go to sleep especially if Ron and Rand Paul get behind him
[41:39.120 --> 41:44.680]  ladies and gentlemen Ron and Rand Paul you may have some strategy that you
[41:44.680 --> 41:47.920]  think's gonna get you in there and that you understood you couldn't use the
[41:47.920 --> 41:50.400]  delegates it would look like you were stealing the election so you're gonna
[41:50.400 --> 41:53.280]  try to get a speaking slot in the cabinet position or something or Rand on
[41:53.280 --> 41:59.200]  the ticket let's say you do that let's say they let you have some rhetoric
[41:59.200 --> 42:04.920]  about constitutional ideas you'll just be used as a shield to co-op they know
[42:04.920 --> 42:08.840]  you were the front runners they know you you you came from nowhere in Kentucky
[42:08.840 --> 42:14.280]  they know Ron Paul was really winning they know that there isn't any support
[42:14.280 --> 42:19.920]  for Romney that I see out there okay by conservatives libertarians
[42:19.920 --> 42:25.080]  constitutionalist real conservatives okay there isn't the support so they need
[42:25.080 --> 42:31.080]  Ron Paul they need Ron Paul you don't need them and again all the staff are
[42:31.080 --> 42:34.400]  in there because they want the big Republican jobs they want to secure
[42:34.400 --> 42:37.640]  their dynasties the people working for Ron Paul and the rest of them and
[42:37.640 --> 42:42.800]  they're all they're saying hey Papa Paul don't go you know retire at your farm
[42:42.800 --> 42:48.840]  in South Texas you get us into the Republican Party and you're gonna regret
[42:48.840 --> 42:53.240]  those 30 pieces of silver if that's ends up what's happening I understand the
[42:53.240 --> 43:00.560]  arguments I understand the reasons my gut my gut tells me this is a bad idea
[43:00.560 --> 43:04.000]  and that this is not gonna end well I asked Aaron Dykes during the break who's
[43:04.000 --> 43:11.520]  beside himself right now and yeah it's like somebody dropped a bomb on the
[43:11.520 --> 43:14.120]  office I'm like what did you think was gonna happen they're all like yes you're
[43:14.120 --> 43:18.680]  right as usual I'm not smart folks I'm just not gullible I've got street smarts
[43:18.680 --> 43:23.400]  and he said Ron Paul has blown his foot off and now if he goes ahead with this
[43:23.400 --> 43:26.680]  he's gonna politically shoot himself in the head and I said I absolutely agree
[43:26.680 --> 43:34.520]  with you even if Ron Paul's right that you go in you influence Romney that's
[43:34.520 --> 43:38.920]  only gonna be on the surface because the big banks that have paid for Mitt
[43:38.920 --> 43:43.360]  Romney and the media that attacked and demonized Ron Paul and all the rest of
[43:43.360 --> 43:47.120]  them they're gonna turn on you later anyways and you're not gonna have your
[43:47.120 --> 43:52.560]  supporters anymore campaign for liberty we have sat here and watch this happen
[43:52.560 --> 43:56.920]  and I watched Adam Koch start going after Paul a few weeks ago and I said
[43:56.920 --> 44:04.400]  he's probably right but I'm gonna hold back and to be clear I still am not
[44:04.400 --> 44:11.720]  giving my judgment on this I'm letting the entire Paul system know that you
[44:11.720 --> 44:17.200]  better come out in a press conference and you better address your supporters
[44:17.200 --> 44:20.640]  because the way they let the supporters think that they were really gonna
[44:20.640 --> 44:25.880]  contest the delegates when I knew they weren't and I was like okay I guess maybe
[44:25.880 --> 44:29.040]  Paul's gonna do something I don't know but you've heard me on air I've said
[44:29.040 --> 44:32.360]  some of this but tried to hold back national media came to me and said we've
[44:32.360 --> 44:35.680]  noticed you've been saying little things and what do you want I'm like you just
[44:35.680 --> 44:40.880]  want to drive a wedge no Ron Paul and Rand Paul are great and then there's
[44:40.880 --> 44:44.520]  almost no communication because they know the minute they really can see this
[44:44.520 --> 44:47.640]  they have to concede to Romney to get the momentum behind them to get Romney
[44:47.640 --> 44:51.120]  behind them you know they're being told okay you want Rand on the ticket or you
[44:51.120 --> 44:56.240]  want you know this or that you've got to concede so they concede in the media on
[44:56.240 --> 44:59.400]  Hannity a few I'm you know a month ago but then say oh no that really wasn't
[44:59.400 --> 45:03.520]  conceding then no no no no we're gonna we just weren't gonna spend money in
[45:03.520 --> 45:08.840]  those states I'm like yeah but this looks like it okay okay I'll buy that I'll
[45:08.840 --> 45:13.720]  have faith in people I've had faith in for 17 years I'll I'll do that but
[45:13.720 --> 45:18.560]  danger will Robinson behind the scenes I was just like man I got a
[45:18.560 --> 45:22.960]  responsibility and I do have a responsibility if you guys go south on
[45:22.960 --> 45:28.320]  us I'm coming after you politically you better know that so you people are
[45:28.320 --> 45:31.800]  saying we ought to have Ron Paul and Rand Paul influence for Romney that's
[45:31.800 --> 45:37.680]  like having Obama supporters try to influence him ain't gonna happen okay
[45:37.680 --> 45:42.880]  they're up there in that Beltway ladies and gentlemen and again some will say
[45:42.880 --> 45:46.480]  well hey why even go after him let him kind of merge with Romney and you know
[45:46.480 --> 45:50.520]  the argument there is hey they're gonna be pro-gun anti-fellow reserve and
[45:50.520 --> 45:59.480]  anti-war on many levels and so why not just go along with it all I'm saying is
[45:59.480 --> 46:03.600]  the supporters are not buying this I got to say the email the comments we're
[46:03.600 --> 46:09.720]  seeing 85% are hopping mad and let me tell you they're not gonna go away I
[46:09.720 --> 46:16.240]  mean it's it's one thing you know with Romney or Obama when they when they
[46:16.240 --> 46:21.040]  betray sheep but you betray constitutionalist if you betray them or
[46:21.040 --> 46:25.000]  if it's perceived and this is exactly what the globalists want it's why I
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.360]  haven't taken the bait when national media's called me or come out to events
[46:28.360 --> 46:32.720]  I'm at and said oh do a big feature story on you about the Paul's or they
[46:32.720 --> 46:35.000]  betray I'm like no they're not betraying any and they throw out all the
[46:35.000 --> 46:38.400]  betrayals you know what looks like betrayals and I'm like oh well I don't
[46:38.400 --> 46:45.760]  see that yet I'm gonna keep my mind open and so I've sat there just watching
[46:45.760 --> 46:53.040]  this this unfold and again I'm not gonna tell you how the Calate the cabbage
[46:53.040 --> 46:58.560]  here but here it is Ron Paul supporters decry brands endorsement of Romney
[46:58.560 --> 47:04.560]  majority accused Kentucky senator of selling out to Republican establishment
[47:04.560 --> 47:09.960]  and this is really hurts bad and this is Bob Chapman was always with us on
[47:09.960 --> 47:14.560]  Friday's he died Monday what up you know you have the great news of Bilderberg
[47:14.560 --> 47:17.920]  being blown wide open and all this happening of the good news is Liberty
[47:17.920 --> 47:22.440]  marches on and all here's the good news all of Ron Paul's work has been so
[47:22.440 --> 47:25.360]  effective and good against the globalists it's been beautiful it's been
[47:25.360 --> 47:29.600]  wonderful and I guess this is just success I mean he was really gonna be
[47:29.600 --> 47:34.760]  the real nominee they stole it now they want him and why shouldn't he go and
[47:34.760 --> 47:39.400]  try to have some influence see I get it I get it I get it but my gut that's
[47:39.400 --> 47:45.960]  never wrong tells me they've fallen into a trap that's what I want to say that's
[47:45.960 --> 47:50.360]  what I'm trying to get out here there's so much spin on this by the media and
[47:50.360 --> 47:56.360]  the and others that I'm trying to hit it with with my system to unspin it
[47:56.360 --> 48:02.360]  Rand Paul endorses Romney we have the video clip in case you don't think this
[48:02.360 --> 48:06.120]  really happened here's the Austin Chronicle Ron Paul supporters Ron Paul
[48:06.120 --> 48:11.040]  concedes defeat asked supporters to be respectful in Tampa I mean I've seen
[48:11.040 --> 48:14.760]  countless videos of Ron Paul supporters getting arrested and getting beat up when
[48:14.760 --> 48:17.960]  they are the majority delegates and the Republicans changed the rules in front
[48:17.960 --> 48:23.400]  of them the rules they passed in 2010 they say well now those are in 2014 the
[48:23.400 --> 48:28.080]  next congressional election and they beat them up and drag them out and then
[48:28.080 --> 48:32.640]  Ron Paul says be respectful direct talking points out of Romney and the
[48:32.640 --> 48:38.120]  RNC that that's like a punch in the stomach man that that that that hurts
[48:38.120 --> 48:42.840]  but I'm gonna be controlled about this and I'm going to analyze it and then if
[48:42.840 --> 48:49.800]  it is the case I am going to I am going to absolutely get the American people
[48:49.800 --> 48:58.800]  motivated I'm just gonna leave it at that and again I read that let we're gonna
[48:58.800 --> 49:04.120]  go to break and come back the toll free number to join us 800 2599231 I'm gonna
[49:04.120 --> 49:09.120]  go ahead right now and play you part of Fox News Sean Hannity New World Order
[49:09.120 --> 49:13.600]  Central the folks who told you the new order doesn't exist and you know all
[49:13.600 --> 49:17.600]  the rest of it people that demonize Ron Paul 24 7 and cheat him on the polls and
[49:17.600 --> 49:23.040]  everything this reminds me of Robert the Bruce this really happened in history
[49:23.040 --> 49:27.360]  who had all the clans you know to defeat the British and then he sold
[49:27.360 --> 49:33.840]  everybody out and sold William Wallace out and I guess he realized it later and
[49:33.840 --> 49:37.120]  came back and actually defeated the British but I mean this is exactly like
[49:37.120 --> 49:42.200]  Braveheart I was having flashbacks this morning to that you maintain your title
[49:42.200 --> 49:48.040]  expanded your lines you've done well you survived you don't survive tyranny
[49:48.040 --> 49:52.800]  things are too dark they're launching drones reeducation camps we got to get
[49:52.800 --> 49:59.960]  hardcore not work with the system anymore let's go ahead and go to the tape
[49:59.960 --> 50:04.480]  here it is well you know my first choice had always been my father I
[50:04.480 --> 50:09.120]  campaign for him when I was 11 years old he's still my first pick but you know
[50:09.120 --> 50:13.160]  now the nominating process is over tonight I'm happy to announce that I'm
[50:13.160 --> 50:17.440]  gonna be supporting Governor Romney yeah how do you look if you didn't support
[50:17.440 --> 50:22.160]  your father by the way I mean I would really question family loyalty there and

[54:12.600 --> 54:16.800]  what are the votes on YouTube and I've seen other polls showing the same number
[54:16.800 --> 54:24.480]  952 votes against what Rand Paul said 69 supporting what he said so that's
[54:24.480 --> 54:29.040]  that's more than 90 percent right there what does that come out to 69 divided
[54:29.040 --> 54:37.280]  into 952 what is that more than 95% don't like it so I think this is a major
[54:37.280 --> 54:42.640]  miscalculation but what did you expect they kept everybody going telling them
[54:42.640 --> 54:48.080]  they were gonna win with delegates while Rand came on this show a couple months
[54:48.080 --> 54:53.240]  ago and said well yes you know now that we're moving forward implying Romney
[54:53.240 --> 54:57.680]  was the guy and and why is it Rand making this announcement on Hannity
[54:57.680 --> 55:04.120]  again maybe they've got some plan I don't know about they their voting records
[55:04.120 --> 55:10.600]  are great so I I still support them I still like Rand Paul but I'm telling you
[55:10.600 --> 55:16.760]  this is not gonna go over well with the supporters who a lot of them would look
[55:16.760 --> 55:20.320]  at me and say he's going to be president even over the weekend I said no he's not
[55:20.320 --> 55:24.560]  he's only got 20% of the delegates and that would be suicide to try to contest
[55:24.560 --> 55:28.720]  it I said you watch he isn't they'd say say that on tape but I'd say no I'm not
[55:28.720 --> 55:33.760]  I'm gonna let you experience this for yourself and because I just understand
[55:33.760 --> 55:39.400]  basic politics now again I understand the poll position hey might as well try to
[55:39.400 --> 55:43.960]  influence Romney might as well that's what they're being told you know hey you
[55:43.960 --> 55:47.560]  know Romney will listen to you get behind Romney because there's no there's no
[55:47.560 --> 55:51.080]  Romney road signs there's no Romney bumper stickers if you've seen one tell
[55:51.080 --> 55:55.760]  me about it all I saw driving across this country was Ron Paul signs this is
[55:55.760 --> 56:01.560]  the tail wagging the dog this is a little Republican tail that had to cheat
[56:01.560 --> 56:06.960]  that that treated Ron Paul supporters like trash and let me tell you this
[56:06.960 --> 56:10.360]  morning I was gonna come out and say well let's just wait and see till I saw
[56:10.360 --> 56:14.840]  the Paul quote in the Houston Chronicle and I saw it in their email they put
[56:14.840 --> 56:19.840]  out didn't just believe them saying be respectful in Tampa what we were I mean
[56:19.840 --> 56:26.080]  so you know be respectful does that translate to sit down and shut up again
[56:26.080 --> 56:31.000]  my point is I'm now in a stance of I'm watching I'm watching I'm watching I'm
[56:31.000 --> 56:35.200]  not gonna just sit here and go oh well you know 17 years of me trusting somebody
[56:35.200 --> 56:40.800]  we'll see what happens we'll see what happens now that we got loaded phones
[56:40.800 --> 56:43.960]  here we'll have nothing but open phones the next hour the Lord montan's coming
[56:43.960 --> 56:47.080]  on I got a bunch of other news I've even gotten to yet I'm gonna try to get to
[56:47.080 --> 56:51.640]  more of that but Justin in Missouri what's your take on all this should I
[56:51.640 --> 56:57.440]  just get behind Romney and then and maybe George Bush to know not at all
[56:57.440 --> 57:02.040]  and this is what I meant I called you about six seven months ago during the
[57:02.040 --> 57:05.640]  debates I saw what was coming I mean because it was obvious that they weren't
[57:05.640 --> 57:09.960]  attacking each other they were having meetings behind closed doors I mean you
[57:09.960 --> 57:13.680]  know and I'm just completely they said they weren't they said they weren't and
[57:13.680 --> 57:16.800]  if I find out a year down the road or something one of their people shoots their
[57:16.800 --> 57:20.480]  mouth off if I found out they lied to us all hell's gonna break loose you go
[57:20.480 --> 57:24.480]  ahead yeah that's what I was telling you when I called before that I would take
[57:24.480 --> 57:28.880]  every one of the subscribers I've got and I'll just turn every gun I have
[57:28.880 --> 57:32.160]  against them on on the videos I'm making I mean because that that's just this
[57:32.160 --> 57:36.320]  ridiculous well let's not do that yet I mean Ron Paul and Rand Paul need to
[57:36.320 --> 57:39.720]  respond and that doesn't even mean on my show quite frankly when they come on my
[57:39.720 --> 57:43.160]  show I don't even get extra listeners I can people want to hear my commentary my
[57:43.160 --> 57:46.960]  analysis I mean I haven't even been trying to get them on the last three
[57:46.960 --> 57:50.880]  four months salon was asking hey where's Ron Paul I'm like well we tried a few
[57:50.880 --> 57:53.280]  times to get him on they said they were come on later they were busy fine
[57:53.280 --> 57:57.680]  doesn't matter to me you know I'm doing them a favor having them on my show this
[57:57.680 --> 58:02.880]  show was the original launch pad out of Texas for these guys that Ron Paul's
[58:02.880 --> 58:07.760]  admitted that so you know again I haven't even attempted to get them on the
[58:07.760 --> 58:12.720]  show they need to come on shows or do a press conference and explain all this to
[58:12.720 --> 58:15.960]  us I'm gonna have a message I'm gonna shoot later today that'll be up at
[58:15.960 --> 58:20.560]  YouTube tonight and info wars.com and it's gonna be a message directly to
[58:20.560 --> 58:26.680]  these guys and I want to hear my points answered this is all just a brainstorm
[58:26.680 --> 58:32.960]  session with you on air but let me tell you we may not fully understand what
[58:32.960 --> 58:36.160]  they're doing they need to make it clear to us because that what they've done is
[58:36.160 --> 58:46.920]  gone over like a lead Zeppelin this is GCN the Genesis communications radio

[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:20.080]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:23.640]  Alex Jones
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:29.520]  all right I have broken down for the last hour the fact that Ron Paul says the
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:35.400]  supporters be polite and go give your delegates to Mitt Romney after just
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.760]  keeping them the momentum and the donations and everything going now
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:44.440]  merge with Mitt Romney and ran coming out in the coordinated fashion endorsing
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:49.880]  Mitt Romney they need to explain themselves on this front this is what I
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:54.240]  saw in their political strategy but not what they put out to their supporters
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.840]  and and it's the political way this was done and the way the supporters were
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:02.800]  used is pure capital that is the reason I'm being somewhat negative I still
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:06.960]  respect their voting records respect both men support them over the gun
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:11.520]  grabbing new world order people that are in office they're fighting but we need
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.240]  clear messages you see the message of liberty starting to really have an
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.720]  effect and hit pay dirt we're starting to really win and we don't need to see
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:24.200]  you know Anakin Skywalker go over to Emperor Palpatine here I mean we really
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:29.000]  don't need to see this right now let's go back to your phone calls let's go to
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  John and Wyoming you're on the air John what do you think of this yeah Alex when
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.840]  I lived in southeast Texas now I've known Ron Paul personally for 38 years and
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:44.240]  I'm just I have the same gut feeling that you do about this thing this whole
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:48.280]  thing stinks of a sellout now let me tell you two things that have happened in
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:53.040]  his campaign that seemed like deliberate sabotage first of all I still have a
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.600]  lot of friends and relatives living in the Houston area although I'm way up
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:01.080]  here in Sheridan Wyoming and all of my friends and relatives were saying that
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:07.760]  why the heck did Ron not tour through Houston and Harris County when he was
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:12.080]  campaigning for you know this even before Texas and other key states he
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:15.480]  said we're no longer going for delegates we're no longer going in these
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:20.880]  states and I'm like you could have won Texas I saw that and I said oh no no
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:26.000]  don't give over don't don't kneel to the dark side and then now this I mean how
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.120]  many more I mean I'm sorry go ahead sir well that's another key point right
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:33.520]  there I'm writing that down you're right to not campaign hard in Texas yeah
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:38.480]  there's another key point is I noticed that he was not speaking at the NRA
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:42.720]  convention in St. Louis and then at first I thought well the NRA didn't invite
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:47.880]  him but when I called him they said John we invited all of the Republican
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:53.120]  candidates but for some reason Ron did not accept and I called Ron's campaign
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.920]  headquarters in Virginia and I said what's going on here and they gave me a
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.840]  bunch of Weasley remarks as to why Ron didn't speak I said I would have
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.960]  personally driven because I've been a life member of the NRA since 78 I said
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.960]  I would have personally driven from Sheridan Wyoming to St. Louis to introduce
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:17.120]  Ron that would have been an absolute key to speak at that I mean it's so many
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:22.280]  Republican candidates do it was insane listen I mean I'll tell you the last few
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.920]  months when our listeners call up supporting and even trying to give
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:28.920]  money they'll get little snide remarks about me of my names brought up that
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:33.160]  never happened before I mean I wonder who is in that campaign now I mean it
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:38.240]  I mean is it Bill Clinton running under something well the whole point is Ron was
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:43.400]  the only real pro-gun candidate who would have been embraced by the NRA
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:48.320]  membership and gun owners all over the country and yet he blew that golden
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:52.520]  opportunity he didn't show up and no no instead it was all about campaign for
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:56.440]  liberty and the idea of liberty on campuses which I know is effective and
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:00.240]  good but listen he didn't just he stopped doing a lot of big syndicated
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:04.720]  shows that were his bread and butter about four months ago I tell you I look
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.760]  before I was just kind of hey it doesn't matter he's not gonna win now let
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.360]  folks be delusional about the delegate thing I knew we had to cross this bridge
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:16.680]  and I thought please don't don't do what my gut tells me's about to happen and I
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:21.120]  tell you like you said my gut this is maybe it's threats you know they called
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:25.800]  up in the early 90s they called up Ross Perot and said we're gonna kill your
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:31.880]  daughter and your family and he he he was gonna win imagine Ron Paul should
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.280]  have run third party to inject real ideas he'd have gotten 50 million dollars
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:39.880]  that would have that would have built a new third rail in this country but it
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:44.680]  didn't happen what's your final analysis you what's your gut tell you on this one
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:50.800]  John I think Alex we're being sold out and why I don't know and I don't know if
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.440]  we'll ever know but something is happening to sell us out yeah it's

[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:09.720]  ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:14.760]  well as all of our listeners know I absolutely love Ron Paul and his
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:18.040]  incredible voting record his philosophy of constitutional limited
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:26.400]  government is incredibly a positive voting record that is perfect ran Paul
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:30.040]  who I encourage to run my listeners for the first to give him money the first to
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:38.120]  staff his original staff I know he's a good man and I understand why if you
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:42.000]  have Romney approach him and talk about a cabinet slot for Ron Paul or VP for
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.920]  Rand and I know that's being debated and up in the air and they're having
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:48.880]  private meetings I understand how they could say to themselves well let's take
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:53.760]  over the Republican Party or part of it with the giant liberty movement but
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:58.120]  that's not what happens in politics Mitt Romney is bought and paid for his
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:05.200]  voting record his fruits abortion open borders gun control carbon taxes wrote
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:12.920]  Obamacare it's really a Romney care or Rom bumma care I don't know how you
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:20.000]  combine their two names oh Romney care that that's not really gonna happen you
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.440]  know the question is can you push Romney to be good I can't stand Barack Obama I
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:28.960]  wish Mitt Romney was for real but here's the deal I can't go down with the
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:33.800]  sinking campaign for Liberty ship I can't do it I mean if it's just gonna be
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:39.080]  taken over by a bunch of slightly libertarian Republicans when our country
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.800]  is having its entire Bill of Rights and Constitution overthrown the
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:47.880]  technocracies coming in I cannot and I will not go down with that sinking ship
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:53.800]  and let me tell you we're on over a hundred stations XM 166 just joined us
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:57.560]  I'm Alex Jones syndicated radio we're live it is Friday the 8th day of June
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:04.640]  2012 I cannot go down with my family with the Romney ship now I'm not in
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:08.560]  overdrive attacking Romney you notice it's Obama saying he's gonna sign
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:12.600]  executive orders to put us under UN control with law of the sea it's Obama
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:17.280]  going into hyper warp with checkpoints and police state and TSA if Romney got
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:22.920]  in and suddenly shut down the TSA or got rid of the body scanners and did cut
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:27.600]  taxes and shut down some bases I'd go wow well the elite has figured out we're
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:31.560]  gonna collapse if they don't back off well Romney's kind of like Reagan you
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:36.400]  know but again I reserve judgment on that until I see something different I
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:42.760]  don't just oh I oppose Obama cuz I you know I thought you didn't like Bush why
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:45.720]  don't you like Obama cuz he's bought and paid for by the same people look at
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:49.440]  his advisors look who's giving him money I knew what he was gonna do not
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:57.400]  because I'm smart but because I'm not an idiot I'm not an idiot I'm not a moron
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:02.700]  I mean is that hard to figure out how many times we have a we have an
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:07.240]  illustration hanging on the wall in fact Aaron just tweeted it out he took a
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:11.040]  photo of it guys will you go to the real Alex Jones I asked him to Twitter it
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:14.320]  tweeted during the last break and it shows a pyramid that's the neural order
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:17.920]  with a red leg and a blue leg the blue legs the Democrats the red legs the
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:23.480]  Republicans and each election one of the legs steps forward and crushes the
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:27.840]  constituents that's an analogy I talked about for over a decade folks have
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:32.880]  picked that up and put it into illustration we wanted to create a new leg
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:37.200]  or two new legs of libertarian constitutionalism to take America back
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:40.560]  now there it is we can blow that up actually just click on the photo thank
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:46.320]  you that's hanging on our wall here in the office left right left right next
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:50.760]  time I'll vote Democrat the Republican says as they're being stepped on next
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:54.360]  time I'll vote Republican the Democrat says as they're being stepped on and so
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:58.880]  it goes on forever while the mainstream corporatist media belches out its
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:06.920]  propaganda it's called the March of tyranny by Ben Garrison and there you
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:10.640]  have it up at the real Alex Jones on Twitter so I'm gonna try to shut up and
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:14.480]  go back to your calls but you know these emails are pouring in has Romney
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.520]  turned against the New World Order question mark are Easter bunnies real I
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:23.040]  don't know the Santa Claus real blast on my check no what if the Mormons'
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.600]  Amishic said have turned against the New World Order and are secretly trying to
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:32.800]  defeat them why did most of the Mormons I've seen are supporting Ron Paul why
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:37.640]  did Clinton come out to be any Romney because the Clintons through blackmail
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:44.080]  run Obama why is LaRue seeming to be pro Romney and anti-Obama because they
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:47.320]  see it as a signal if we get rid of Obama to the world that things are
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:51.720]  changing only if it's an impeachment though the devil has so many devious
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:56.600]  scams up his sleeve I'm sure it's all planned by God regardless if they come
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:00.280]  out maybe they'll blow their cover but they need to unite and say Romney
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:05.160]  Ron Paul Rand are here to double-cross the New World Order that sounds like
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:09.560]  delusion here's another one from Ernie I think they probably have been threatened
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:16.440]  I think so we get threatened on a daily basis yes undoubtedly Ron Paul entered a
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:20.200]  very dangerous realm where he really was winning the early primaries then when
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:23.680]  they stole it from him people thought well he's not really gonna win momentum
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:28.120]  did shift to Romney but again there's no hype behind him because they know that
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:32.560]  conservatives are like this guy has a bad record I mean do you need me to play
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:36.880]  the clips of him endorsing abortion I've always supported abortion or gun
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:42.280]  control or any of it I mean look I just want a future I'm not just here to oppose
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:51.280]  people so many people we had on his guest endorsed Obama and I would still
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:56.400]  have him on his guest people like Mike Rivera because I understood that they
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:59.440]  really wanted to believe that things were gonna get better like children and
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.520]  then of course I forgave folks when I was proven right again that Obama sold
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:09.080]  everybody out but I understood why people wanted to believe that Obama was
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:18.640]  a good guy but I'm like I'm sorry it's not the case the way they announced this
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:22.120]  the way Ron Paul said in his own press release you know you need to be
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:26.600]  respectful Ron Paul supporters who've been beat up and everything else when
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:29.480]  they're the majority when they've really won when they're the delegates and the
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:32.880]  Republican leadership knows says no we're we're taking the delegates and
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:37.160]  changes the rules and people say no no no and the police beat them up the
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:42.080]  answer is you go and you sit there as our good little block and you support
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:48.800]  Romney and is it better to get Romney in than Obama or is it better because we
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:54.160]  know Obama's bad he's been discredited to keep him in and just so we can impeach
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:57.960]  him and so we can fully with more libertarian types take control the
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:01.720]  House and Senate because you know what happens when Republicans get the House
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:06.320]  Senate and the executive can you imagine they love the drones they love the NDA
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:11.400]  they love handing control over to the UN another thing Ron Paul hardly talked
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:15.440]  about senator but Congressman Walter Jones's bill to impeach that should
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:18.800]  have been his number one issue we try to get those questions into Paul it
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:22.520]  press conferences and they'd say nope nope no more questions I mean it's like
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:27.200]  come on use the bully pulpit you've got Ron Paul should be out there
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:31.400]  campaigning right now for impeachment right now to fight the neural order and
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:37.560]  again I've held my tongue and I reserve judgment but our listeners are hopping
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:42.680]  mad and you did this to yourself all the little campaign people that work for
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:45.680]  Ron and Rand who think they're gonna get all the big jobs in the White House now
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:53.440]  that their average age is about 25 and their main line Republicans their main
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:16:02.680]  line Republicans and again we can't have Lou Rockwell go down with the ship I'm
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:06.680]  not going down with the ship not going down with the ship we just give you a
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:11.160]  little newsflash I'm not going down with the ship and right now you just blew
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:14.360]  holes in the bottom you better do a press conference and patch those holes
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:19.360]  right now and explain to us why you played everybody along that you were
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:22.320]  gonna get the delegates and some miracle was gonna happen when we all knew it
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:26.680]  wasn't because it kept the donations going it kept building the power block to
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:32.040]  get the princeling in we don't want a princeling we want Ron Paul we want
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:35.800]  Rand Paul to act like Ron Paul and he has a good voting record he's done good
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:42.360]  things don't screw it up okay I'm ranting I'm ranting here ladies and gentlemen
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:48.200]  it's the whole way this has been handled I don't like it Sean you're on the air
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:52.120]  go ahead delisting on WWCR global shortwave what's your take on all this
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:55.920]  am I wrong should I get behind Mitt Romney should I get behind main capital
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:01.840]  should I get behind the New World Order you're 100% right Alex I had some quick
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:06.440]  points I wanted to make but now I've got to talk on some of the points you've
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:10.720]  just made you use the word forceful there's always been a problem with Ron
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:16.120]  Paul and even the kid ran when I watched on television Rand Paul accept his
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:20.160]  nomination in Kentucky he talked about constitutional principles and this and
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:24.960]  he walked around this quote by Jefferson and I kept saying why doesn't he just
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:29.120]  say this quote and this is where constitutionalist and I've been in this
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:34.680]  movement since 83 in the West I get hung up all the time let no more be heard
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:38.440]  of confidence in men but buying him down from mischief by the change of the
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:44.640]  Constitution this is 1980 in the inverse where where you had a candidate
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.680]  like Ron Paul talking about the gold standard talking about constitutional
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:55.800]  principles and he was subverted or sabotaged in Detroit by the establishment
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:00.360]  and he actually picked somebody who was part of the cops on for Ronald Reagan on
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:04.360]  record was anti-New World Order gave speeches said George Herbert Walker was
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:10.000]  trilateral was a globalist and they came to him and this is on record and said
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.760]  this came out in the news you will not get it unless you put George Herbert
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:17.640]  Walker on and then they shot Reagan to get him under control go ahead
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:21.880]  you're absolutely right and we've talked before I was one of the people I was 19
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:26.320]  years old and I saw this with my own eyes and when you see things in life
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:31.360]  like Bob Chapman who I had the pleasure of talking to once and you see how
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:36.400]  strong the the establishment is you never forget it a couple other things I
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:40.360]  talked with Sheriff Mack about five weeks ago perhaps you should have him on
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:44.280]  the program because he was telling me some negative things that were going on
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:50.600]  within the campaign in southeast Texas the other you hit Ron Paul's campaign
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:56.040]  to go further he's got Ted Cruz in there who actually voted for tax increases I
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:58.920]  was looking at his voting record and they're calling him great at Ron Paul
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:04.800]  rallies his wife CFR I'm gonna shut up right now I just have been holding my

[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:30.960]  in the West now I used to be Catholic and there's a I no longer I'm a Christian
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:34.680]  but there's a term Catholic and a non-practicing Catholic in the West here
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:39.640]  and you probably know there's but you're a Mormon or a Jack Mormon Romney is a
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:45.320]  way to way out there being a Jack Mormon the real Mormons this this Romney is
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:51.240]  not in the mold of a Cleon Scouts and a Joel Scouts and you you and I agree on
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:57.920]  that and you know it's gonna come down to a fight that's what only is coming

[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:12.080]  before I even got on air an hour ago an hour and a half ago the Washington
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:17.040]  Examiner had already put out an article Ron Paul fans attack Rand for endorsing
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:21.520]  Romney so they're already gonna go oh mainline Republicans don't see Rand and
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:27.960]  Ron are good the evil Alex Jones people my fans see see now you're not a human
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:33.360]  when you go out and complain on the web and have a view as a Ron Paul supporter
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:38.920]  that gave money and we're involved your trash the system just wants us to tear
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:42.800]  each other apart look Ron and Rand have done overall a great job fighting the
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:48.720]  globalist it's just sad to see stuff like this happening and it says Ron Paul
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:52.960]  fans attack Rand for endorsing Romney fans of the Ron Paul revolution were
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:58.120]  not happy with his son ran after an endorsement last night on Sean Hannity
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:02.120]  show Paul explained that although his first choice was always his father he
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:07.160]  insisted that he had a lot in common Romney who signal to him that he was
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:12.080]  serious about a number of government reforms but the backlash on Senator Paul's
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:16.000]  Facebook page was fierce as the vocal supporters of Ron Paul revolution took
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.800]  the comment section to denounce his son as of this morning 2000 comments were
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:23.560]  posted a majority of the negative supporters blasted Rand Paul for
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:28.400]  selling out the legacy of his father the Republican establishment a few fans
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:32.120]  approved of Rand's discussion and again the Google search had my name in it I
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:35.880]  don't see where that is here me control left this they may have taken it out no
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:43.560]  there it is it goes on I wish these nuts jobs just unsubscribe on the page go
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:49.040]  listen to Alex Jones and eat paint chips I will not support Mitt but I am not
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:55.360]  going to blast Rand so they go on and use comments in there to try to make me
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:26:03.240]  sound bad so there you go I'm the bad guy as usual in these comments from the
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:07.040]  Republican establishment type publication who just wants to get us all
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:12.480]  all fighting with each other so that's going to be the word from them you just
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:18.840]  need to roll over do whatever you're told and be respectful at the thing and
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:21.960]  and and support Mitt Romney so there you have it I mean that could have been done
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:25.680]  a little bit better like I think overall you know he's not perfect but we should
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:29.680]  support Mitt Romney because he at least is better than Obama no it's like you be
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:34.960]  respectful and so okay I'm respectful I'll support Mitt Romney yes sir and I'll
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:43.320]  go eat some paint chips now because man I tell you and it just goes on and on the
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:48.360]  daily beast is reporting on it a whole bunch of them are there you go the
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:53.160]  wedges are going in from the control left and control right right now and he
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:58.760]  either support Mitt Romney or you're a bad American get that through your head
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:03.760]  now again here we are Ron Paul who put out ad saying Mitt Romney was bad and
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:07.560]  all this his son is out there endorsing him because why both their dads ran for
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:12.720]  president and again I like Rand I'm not his enemy even if he starts playing
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:16.840]  politics he's got a better voting record than the other senators I don't spend my
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:20.440]  time going after Dement he's not perfect but he's got a good voting record on a
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:24.840]  lot of issues my point is is that this is the pureness of Ron Paul we're
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:28.880]  talking about here and people aren't gonna like it so they're gonna try to
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:32.800]  find somebody they find polarizing that's clear Alex Jones and say oh see
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:39.160]  without me even going after him before this even happened well first it was
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:43.480]  Alex Jones fans that was the original headline look I found it right here I
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:50.760]  put Alex Jones Rand Paul in a Ron Paul and click news and it full I just hit
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:56.360]  refresh and it went from Alex Jones fans attack they said no that's even better
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:00.720]  drive the wedge make it Ron Paul they just changed that for the time I hit
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:05.480]  refresh amazing they said no no don't make it about Alex Jones make it a wedge
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:09.760]  in the family see they want to hurt this Liberty movement look Ron Paul's in a
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:14.440]  great job overall libertarian constitutional movement it's just this is
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:17.920]  a bad move they've really walked directly into the trap and I bet Mitt
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:21.760]  Romney doesn't even give him what they promised I bet they discharge him but by
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:25.480]  them they'll be politically destroyed I just you've got to think Ron Paul and
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:28.480]  Rand Paul are more sophisticated than this and I see a lot of uncoordination
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:31.920]  I've been told by the older members of the campaign the senior people but
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:35.000]  they're not running things on the ground that hey it's 25 year olds they don't
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.640]  know what they're doing every one of them has told me this off record and I'm
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:43.560]  like well that's grassroots but this this isn't just stepping in it this is
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:49.880]  jumping into it and rolling in it after you know what you're rolling in I'm gonna
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:53.680]  go to break long segment coming up I'm gonna control my shelf well I just saw
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:58.680]  this go from Alex Jones fans attack Rand Paul for endorsing Romney that was
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:04.920]  the Washington examiner headline and then it changed by the time I went back
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:08.760]  and hit refresh to Ron Paul fans attack Rand for endorsing Romney did you guys
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:16.400]  have a screenshot of that before they changed it so you did so you did see
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:21.520]  what I saw where it said Alex Jones fans you didn't read it you're not sure

[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:30.440]  friends it is the final countdown to election 2012 Mitt Romney is being crowned
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:40.440]  the nominee before the convention Ron Paul has said be respectful of the event
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:48.160]  in Tampa and so I say I agree Neil to Romney and the new spin is going to be
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:52.680]  you're a bad conspiracy theorist someone that doesn't trust known liars if you
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:56.840]  don't fully do what you're told and all the people that are part of the Ron Paul
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:00.360]  infrastructure and Rand Paul infrastructure are undoubtedly being
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:05.440]  told you get with the program those that are against this are ex-cathedra
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:10.240]  they are ex-communicated they are bad well listen we built Ron Paul we made
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:16.200]  Rand Paul and Liberty will continue and go on and I'm not saying that they're
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:20.840]  bad people they've done a lot of good work but I have seen an attempt by the
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:24.080]  campaign for Liberty and others to bring in mainline Republican candidates and
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:28.160]  just kind of give them the name of you know the certification of Ron Paul
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:34.280]  certified like mr. Cruz Ted Cruz mr. CFR here in Texas who's been for tax
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:38.320]  increases and supporting property taxes and all of it when I heard all this I
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.840]  didn't believe it I went and looked it up and I was like wow well maybe they're
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:44.400]  just not researching well maybe I'm wrong about this maybe I'm wrong about that
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:50.160]  but now the endorsing of Romney when through the campaign people were told
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:54.240]  get more delegates we're going to contested we've got a secret plan I
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:59.640]  was like that's not gonna work and then to watch all this happen and you know to
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:02.720]  see the announcement oh we're not going to campaign in these states but we'll
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:07.720]  still try to get delegates but that's not conceding and oh we're still moving
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:12.760]  forward it was a strategy to keep the donations coming in all of that while
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:18.800]  cozying up to Romney whereas it should have been Paul and ran charging in
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:25.880]  there contesting and all to really get concessions but again we're not sure
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:29.800]  about all this yet my listeners we've even hearing their calls are unanimous
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:36.280]  I mean 95% or more are feel betrayed folks let's not let the globalists play
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:40.000]  this into a big deal and all have a big fracture and turn it into a big route
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.920]  we've exposed the fellow reserve the new world order we're moving forward we
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:48.280]  can use the campaign for liberty system to wake people up at least the remnants
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:53.120]  of it Rand Paul still got a great voting record compared to the other ones but
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:57.600]  this this this does take the sheen off you know they've always tried to that the
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:01.440]  polls were you know you know never selling out this this is a bad move the
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:04.600]  way this was done and when we have to tell them that although keep going down
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:09.040]  this this path forget trying to influence Romney who's bought and paid for
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:12.800]  forever how about we try to influence Ron Paul and Rand Paul bring them back to
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:18.160]  earth here we could give their numbers out on air give me Rand Paul and Ron
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:23.000]  Paul's numbers please bring those in the Senate number bring me the Ron Paul
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.840]  campaign number in Virginia yeah you know what I'm not gonna even do that I
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:32.720]  just I'll I'll wait on that but I mean because we're just those paint chip eaters
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:35.720]  you know we're just those people that put them on the map we're just the people
[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:38.720]  that brought them to the party we're just the we're not all the young little
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:42.520]  Republican purebreds you know when they're thinking of their dreams of
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:47.000]  being big shots in there at the campaign headquarters we're just those scum
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.960]  Americans that gave our money let's go ahead and talk to Bruce in New York
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:56.960]  you're on the air Bruce welcome God bless you there's two points I want to
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:04.360]  make and one is extremely urgent I had received the warning about Obama prior
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:10.360]  to him even being chosen to be president this warning was given to me through a
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:17.040]  newsletter dated March 2008 and this person that received this warning I
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:20.680]  don't know if you believe in dreams and visions but he received ma'am we're
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:25.000]  taking calls we don't screen calls but every once in a while I say we're
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:30.920]  covering Ron Paul Rand Paul election 2012 okay did you call in about that this
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:34.600]  is important because it's about Obama and if he gets back into office what's
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:39.520]  gonna happen that's why I'm reading this okay I know what okay okay I got you
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:42.600]  Obama's gonna be the devil if we don't get Romney in is that the long and short
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:50.040]  of it oh no no it no what the long and short is that Obama is going to outlaw
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:57.800]  Christianity and bring in the nation of Islam and to back that up there is a a
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:04.880]  speaker Israeli speaker called Avi Lipkin who has intelligent information
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:09.720]  through his wife ma'am God bless you I appreciate your call send me that info if
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:12.920]  Obama tried to ban Christianity which they're trying to do incrementally
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:16.720]  banning crosses telling the Catholic Church you gotta you know hire people
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:21.680]  that aren't Catholic you got to pay for abortions that would cause a restoration
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:26.920]  through peaceful revolution overnight bring it on let's get it worse quicker
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:32.640]  let's wake people up that's why they want Romney in now to put everybody back
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:39.080]  to sleep just like I said with Obama they want to change horses Adrian in
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:47.240]  Michigan you're on the air go ahead hello hey buddy well last week I was
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:56.320]  hoping to call in about delegates but at this point seems about pointless well I
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:02.640]  suppose all I can say is that there's no way Rand will become the VP there's no
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:12.200]  way Ron will become any cabinet position simply put if you're going to become
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:18.680]  part of the elite they run like a mafia you're going to have to sell out you're
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:23.640]  going to have to go through their initiation you're going to have to either
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:28.840]  commit a crime or disclose personal information that can destroy you
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:35.400]  absolutely that's when maybe blackmail is going on if not of Ron who's very
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:41.360]  pious but maybe of Rand I'm not saying that who knows but the point is liberty
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:45.960]  is bigger than just the Paul name and Paul has always humbly said that so is
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:52.600]  Rand their voting records are good this is just again their mindset is what do
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:56.720]  you all political capital might as well try to influence Romney but the way it's
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:00.520]  been done all of it is not going to sit well with people you sound pretty
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:08.080]  upset right now yes I am and I agree that it is much bigger than Ron Paul and
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:15.400]  that's because we all stand by an idea and we stand behind an idea and we stand
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:24.120]  by Ron Paul in that idea and I hope that Ron Paul does change his strategy and
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:30.240]  support our principles here well that's right I mean this is a very dangerous
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:34.320]  game they're playing of trying to get Rand in there that's clearly what's
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:38.960]  going on at some high level or maybe even Paul and they're going to be set up
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:45.680]  and it's only imagine they get the Ron Paul movement broken up and
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:50.160]  discredited and then betray them and I'm predicting that's what's going to come
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:55.160]  out of this and I'm sick of it you know that's when I went haywire against
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:58.680]  Deborah Medina when she came out and agreed that it was despicable you know
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:03.000]  9-11 truthers when she'd said it should be investigated it's betrayal that I
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.600]  won't put up with if Ron Paul was only 95% right when he's about 99% right in my
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:13.360]  view and and and I didn't totally agree with him that'd be fine it's when you
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:18.800]  make 180 degree changes and okay you were going to be a delegate Ted Anderson's
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:22.480]  one of the big main state delegates from Minnesota I should get him on the show
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:28.400]  when you're a big delegate and you're involved in all this I mean was the
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:32.440]  campaign not implying like you guys were gonna take over and do something with
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:36.440]  delegates and now you're just being told go give them to you know go give them
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:43.920]  to Romney I'm not completely sure about Paul yet but that does sound like what
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:48.880]  Rand is doing right now all right well again we'll have to get Ron Paul's take
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:53.760]  on all this and he better get on it quick let's go ahead and talk to Robert in
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:42:00.480]  California you're on the air go ahead hello Alex are you doing good you know
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:07.080]  I've worked on the campaign since 2007 as a Los Angeles coordinator and recently
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:11.640]  as his state coordinator and I can tell you there are not gonna disclose any
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:16.960]  sort of campaign things but I can tell you about campaigns in general of how
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:21.960]  the win and how to lose one of the things is especially in California you
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:25.920]  have to have a start of an early presence and back and when he announced
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:30.460]  his presidency we started organizing on the grassroots level and tried to get
[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:33.960]  some help from the campaign just to get a letter to get the voter registration
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:38.760]  so we can start calling and making those necessary things to do when we talk to
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:44.160]  voters and get votes we worked very hard here in California getting those
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:50.040]  delegates that are now seem to be freed up to vote for whoever they want in the
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:54.040]  convention but I believe that the people who live by their principles and vote
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:43:00.400]  for Ron Paul anyway yeah there's we were sort of disappointed on the
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:03.160]  announcement that he wasn't spending money on here instead of just remaining
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:08.560]  silent a week before our primary so there are a few things that you know you
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:14.040]  shouldn't be doing if you want to win elections let me ask you this question
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:21.600]  what do you make of Ron Paul saying when you go to Tampa be respectful well
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:26.160]  we're working on our own fight here in California to take back the Republican
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:30.440]  Party but we are respectful but we're not wimps in other words we stand up to
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:35.280]  him we tell him the truth but we're respectful about it you know I guess
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:41.120]  maybe he's maybe in his word term respectful doesn't mean you know yelling
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:45.440]  and screaming and when the Republicans openly take the delegates away and
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:49.640]  change the rules and have police beat people over the head how about Ron Paul
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:53.520]  tell the police not to do that to his supporters I think he should have done
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:58.360]  that and denounced their behavior one of the things is that I learned in
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:01.600]  politics because I ran for my own office and been helping other people run for
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:05.480]  their campaigns it's four words government works by committee and if we
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:09.920]  have a majority on that committee who are liberty freedom people no matter
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:13.560]  what the political office is that's the way the committee will run and what's
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:17.920]  happened is there's a lot of people have quit participating in their local
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:23.320]  governments and that's what we see is that the evil will actually take that
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:26.400]  place and we're good people are not you're right I appreciate your call
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:31.800]  look here's what needs to be done the campaign for liberty its most important
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:37.000]  function is getting people to run locally for office but they've got to be
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:43.040]  staunch constitutionalist and I began quietly researching about a month ago
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:47.440]  Ted Cruz just right here in Texas and others being endorsed by campaign for
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:53.920]  liberty and a lot of these people they are endorsing are not good so I'm
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:45:00.480]  saying I'm across the board I've kept my mouth shut I'm seeing a lot and again
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:04.800]  the guy he's running against is horrible as well even worse but I mean it still
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:10.840]  it's this idea of we're getting taken over not them I mean Dewhurst is even
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:15.600]  worse he's absolutely horrible I get the mindset I'm just saying this isn't how
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:24.680]  Ron Paul always operated and the firestorm over this our listeners are not
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:29.680]  very happy about this and you can see the news the the the news is picking up
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:35.800]  the fact or not we're not bad I would warn the Paul operation if you come out
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:41.560]  and attack your supporters it's over you will be deserted 95% suspect that
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:45.200]  you're on the plank right now and if you jump off into the sharks that's your
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:51.240]  problem I mean it's very very simple I care about the Pauls I know they're good
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:56.480]  men they're at a very high level now with a lot of stuff going on around them I
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:00.240]  can understand the mindset of hey let's take over the Republican Party but the
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:03.800]  way this is being executed that's not how this is gonna happen and I think it's
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:07.440]  a sneak attack I think the media is now going to exacerbate all this tear
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:15.640]  everything apart and it's it's it's I believe it's a disaster in the making and
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:20.480]  I've kept my mouth shut that's all I can say right now
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:27.080]  Joey in Illinois Joey you're on the air hi Alex I'm just a little old blind gal
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:31.600]  that doesn't know a whole lot but I've been watching this for a while and I'm
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:35.800]  worried and I'm I'm reserving judgment but I've been worried about something for
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:39.680]  a while that all of this may have been planned from the very beginning even by
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:44.920]  the Pauls and it may be that old Hegelian dialectic and I don't want to think
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:49.680]  that I'm trying not to but you know I was a Bush supporter at one time and I
[01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:54.560]  always hang on and and give people the benefit of a doubt and I'm a Christian
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:59.720]  woman and and I believe in being civil to everybody as much as I can you know I
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:05.520]  don't I don't care who they are but I still have my feelings but that's what
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:10.720]  I'm worried that maybe this was all just planned to get them get these libertarian
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:17.240]  people crowd or and then the people that don't like that like us who will
[01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:22.160]  revolt and then they'll clamp down on us I don't think that's what's happening
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:25.760]  because you do judge a tree by its fruits real corrupt people can't
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:30.920]  continue to put out stuff that's coffin nails to the New World Order decade
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:35.200]  after decade and talk about CIA drug dealing a sellout looks like Mitt
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:39.400]  Romney or Barack Obama that that's not what's happening here this is they're
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:44.480]  there with all his political capital they know it's perishable like a peach we
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:47.920]  picked some peaches and some peach trees we've gotten they and they weren't
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:51.520]  totally ripe and just six days later they were already melting you know
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:56.920]  already oozing you know in the bag that we put them in the shopping bag we put
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:00.600]  them in so we had to eat them hurriedly and and and so politically they see all
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:04.800]  this capital and they think they're gonna make some deals but we're not
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:08.520]  hearing about these deals we're told oh we're not talking to Romney that we
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:13.320]  learned there's meetings with Romney closed orb we're being admonished to be
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:18.080]  respectful I mean I knew Paul couldn't go and get delegates and then try to
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:21.360]  contest things that the media would spend that and I kept saying I don't get
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:25.480]  this delegate thing but okay if he wants to go cause a big furor there that's
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:30.640]  wonderful now it's not a furor it's sit down and be respectful that was the the
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:34.680]  tipping point with all the other data I've got I've really reserved judgment on
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:39.520]  this but God bless you I appreciate your call James calling from Connecticut
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:45.600]  they're on the air James hey are you doing Alex good hey I wrote Rand Paul
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:49.600]  actually this morning I'm again a little quote from us actually a rapper
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:53.160]  named a mortal technique yeah he says the problem with always being a
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:56.760]  conformist is that when you try to change the system from within it's not
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:00.880]  you who changes the system the system that eventually changes you there is
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:04.440]  usually nothing wrong with compromising in the situation but compromising
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:10.000]  yourself in a situation is another story completely you know I completely
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.920]  believe that I don't know what exactly he's doing I hope he knows what he's
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:20.200]  doing and he can you know I don't really buy this whole idea that he's gonna be
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:24.040]  able to change anything from the inside because you know how I just said you
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:26.640]  know I mean it's not going to be him that changes the system the system's
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:30.320]  gonna eventually change him well the campaign for liberty is now going for
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:35.500]  more and more mainline Republican types so really it looks like meet the new
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:41.000]  boss same as the old boss I mean if we're gonna replace one line of old
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:48.720]  Republicans with people like slimy Ted Cruz then how about we get the most
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:52.760]  slimy in there and get this over with all this creeping around business is
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:58.120]  what's destroying us I say keep Obama in there this country will really be in a
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:02.880]  revolution I mean I want my Republic back and I'm tired of a bunch of main
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:05.960]  line Republicans you know going around telling me they're gonna fix everything
[01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:11.240]  you guys have done nothing but sell this country out anything else call her yeah
[01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:15.320]  the only thing I say I completely agree with you I think that honestly we need
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:18.520]  to end up at the bottom and that's the only way that anyone else is gonna
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:22.080]  really wake up to this until it's staring them in the face you know it's
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:25.880]  hurt them in their stomach that's that's the only way that you know change is
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:30.040]  going to actually happen so I'm right with you I say you know let's now
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:33.760]  bring it to my front door step let's do this you know it's time to bring it all
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:37.680]  out me open they can you know stop their secretive stuff that's why Ron Paul and
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:41.920]  my listeners and make no mistake you're the turbo booster that got it into orbit
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:47.080]  we got here because we're in their face with the truth not compromising that's
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:52.000]  what wins wars is total commitment we're in a war let's recognize it let's not
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.520]  play patty cake I'm just telling the polls your supporters aren't going to buy

[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:31.600]  mouth I mean what did we expect I mean to keep stay in get delegates got to
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:34.960]  still be the president that way with a minority of delegates he was guaranteed
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:38.680]  to hand him over to Romney what did they think well keep the campaign going keep
[01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:43.920]  educating people but then at the key moment don't fight for Texas don't fight
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:47.200]  for California you just heard one of the campaign people from California
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:53.400]  earlier I don't see Ron Paul and Rand Paul changing the Republicans I see the
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:59.360]  Republicans changing them and that's the issue if I saw Romney out saying we're
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:03.600]  gonna disband the TSA we're gonna stop the groping I'll even take crumbs at
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:08.720]  this point or you know we're gonna get out of the UN or we're gonna something
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:18.360]  nothing nothing but warmongering and in NDA from Mitt Romney and where does the
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:21.200]  polls think they're gonna be in six months everybody's gonna remember we're
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:25.400]  not like mainline political idiots Republicans and mainline you know you
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:30.080]  know Democrats and people we're going to remember all of this I mean this is a
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:34.440]  if you think there's an explosion today over this imagine it down the row this
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:40.040]  is a slow burn as big as the explosions and fires are right now it's only gonna
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:44.360]  get bigger unless Ron Paul comes out and says specifically and not in some
[01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:48.520]  little back channel email you know on TV they make these big announcements and
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:52.600]  everybody you behave yourselves Mitt Romney's our lord and savior but then
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:56.200]  emails oh Ron Paul still got some plans come there I mean it look the
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:59.680]  Republicans are freaked out they know Ron Paul was the real frontrunner and
[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:04.640]  there's a bunch of political dynasty stuff going on I don't like it I don't
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:07.320]  like it one bit and I'll say it right now it's not like this is you know Queen
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:11.560]  Elizabeth and I'm a British subject I'm supposed to whatever you say I'll be
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:15.600]  respectful no I won't be respectful in the face of tyranny because extremism
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:20.920]  and defensive liberty is no vice who said that very goldwater I mean look
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:24.480]  what we've turned into in this country by always compromising compromising
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:29.800]  compromising compromising compromising Dan in Virginia you're on the air go
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:42.440]  ahead Alex yes sir this is your red force cockroach videographer and the high
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:47.400]  from this last weekend under the great gosh shot seven hours of tape for us and
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:49.960]  gave it to us by the way we're using some of that in a piece of the nightly
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:53.560]  news right now brother private investigator tell us to tell us what
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:58.640]  you think of the Ron Paul thing I I'm so confused I don't know what you end
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:05.320]  this up right now I feel like I'm gonna be going to Tampa are you gonna are you
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:12.160]  gonna do what you're told and that Neil the Romney negative no compromise well
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:16.680]  you're not a good person now then well I'm just gonna have to be evil mean and
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:24.840]  nasty yeah I can't I can't figure what are they thinking I was in South
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:32.760]  Carolina for the primary Luke Gingrich had to cancel an event the day before
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:38.200]  the polling was done because nobody showed up and you know it wasn't some
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:42.440]  quarter sort of off the wall group that he was speaking no no no man I mean
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:45.840]  that's right there's no met Romney stickers nothing but Ron ball stickers
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:49.800]  and now we're hearing we need to be respectful of Mitt Romney and the
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:54.800]  Republican machine that cheated Ron Paul I mean I mean I'm trying to be nice
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:59.440]  here and feel like I'm shelling out by not full bore attacking but I'm gonna
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:03.760]  hold back I'm gonna I'm gonna sit back on my judgment but only for a few days
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:09.920]  I've got I better hear something from Ron Paul right now on this I'm with you
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:17.040]  on that you know I knew the fix was in when in South Carolina the polls closed
[01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:22.880]  at seven they declared a winner seven seven o'clock in 28 seconds of course
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:27.240]  the fix was in my friend great to hear from you a few more calls coming up

[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:37.120]  it's one thing to say we're gonna go and make a fracas and try to get Mitt and
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:41.040]  Romney to commit to some things and have Mitt Romney say you know hey I want you
[02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:44.760]  Rand Paul people and I'm gonna you know make these commitments that would be
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:50.560]  at least something but just you know Rand Paul hey I'm endorsing Mitt Romney
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:54.600]  while the Rand Paul people via the campaign have all been told keep going

[02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:08.840]  know it's gonna look like they're trying to steal the election and that I don't
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:11.200]  think Ron Paul's gonna do that of course I've been proven right again he has
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:14.480]  conceded that they didn't win the delegates and that they're not gonna
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:20.960]  contest it and that you need to go and behave yourself we've got Lord Monty

[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:52.840]  family vacations in my book it goes God family country and in this case I was
[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:58.320]  gonna put country before family and I'm also like I'm I'm getting shafted just
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:03.080]  one point also we know your gut your gut if you're tuned into the Almighty is
[02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:08.120]  always right and I got to be honest my gut says betrayal sometimes the Paul
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:11.880]  people may not know this they may have miscoordinated that's why we got it hold
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:15.640]  back but let me tell you my political guns just swung around in their
[02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:20.400]  direction and I got my radar on going analyze analyze and now I'm like you
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:23.840]  already knew this Alex you already saw the signs and I'm like slapping myself
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:27.720]  in the face it's just unbelievable I'm sorry go ahead this is if this is
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:32.800]  betrayal or miscalculated betrayal with unintentional betrayal it's the type that
[02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:36.200]  hurts the worst you know I told people in business I'm in business with you
[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:40.480]  know in life to you know get the capital to run this operation it's one thing if
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:43.240]  I don't know somebody and they and they try to cheat me but if I've worked with
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:47.080]  somebody for a long time and they do something wrong to me I am their enemy
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:53.320]  forever you make something personal with me it's personal I'm sorry go ahead no I
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:57.400]  agree I also I think that it's gonna take a little bit of working on your side
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:02.720]  but we should call a mission by his god-given name Willard you know from
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:06.720]  here on out people need people need to call him by his name he's got this
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:10.400]  Hollywood rock star named Nick because that's the only way that he could get
[02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:16.680]  elected because who's gonna vote for a willard but you must be for Obama hey
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:21.200]  I'm done voting for the lesser two evils okay I mean what do they think we're
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:27.640]  gonna do this is ridiculous his god-given name too but willard is very you
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:31.400]  know if you can't even go by your own name but that's a good Lord gave us like
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:34.360]  Obama's got so many names we don't even know what his name is I appreciate your
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:42.000]  call person Florida you take us out go ahead well Alex I've been impressed by
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:46.320]  Dr. Paul since about 1992 when I was becoming politically active and trying
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:50.600]  to decide for him to vote when I was coming of age to vote but he's done a
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:54.760]  great job at identifying the problem I just don't agree with the solution of a
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:59.800]  state mandated commodity-based currency credit system and now that could be
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:02.800]  manipulated as to but at least wrapping a debate about it that's why I look at
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:08.760]  all the options but what do you think of what's happened currently it's not as
[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:13.840]  shocking and surprising considering that in that he abstained from the NDA voter
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:19.800]  in the first vote for HR 347 Senate bill 1794 and that he voted for the
[02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:25.080]  Afghanistan police action I you know I've been impressed by a lot of the things
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:29.520]  he'd been he's been saying but the problem of course is that the issue of
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:33.720]  currency and credit sure sure that's another debate I hear you I appreciate
[02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:39.040]  your call believe him God not man that's all I can tell you but I've been
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:41.920]  threatened my family's been threatened I didn't compromise I've been offered big
[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:46.280]  jobs I was offered Glenn Beck's job before he existed it was described to me

[02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:20.160]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:26.080]  Texas Alex Jones all right folks coming up about 40 minutes Adam
[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:31.600]  Kokesh is going to pop in to give us his take on Rand Paul endorsing Mitt Romney
[02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:36.680]  and Ron Paul saying he's not going to use the delegates now to try to unseat or
[02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:42.280]  even cause a fracas or challenge it at the RNC that means the deal's been made
[02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:48.080]  for VP for Rand or a cabinet position for Ron we the listeners the supporters
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:53.840]  need to then be told that and need to have the plan explained us not done
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:59.680]  behind closed doors to then make our decision I reserve judgment for now but
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:04.240]  I've told you my issues pro and con they've got great voting records their
[02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:09.640]  constitutionalist against carbon taxes New World Order all of it so for now I'm
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:14.240]  reserving judgment but our listeners are not and it's all over the web 95%
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:20.400]  and votes are down on this and the Republican Party's trying to spin it
[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:25.040]  now Obama's horrible he's terrible and and I would like to think that Mitt
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:30.600]  Romney is going to be a good guy but I know he has the same financial backers
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:36.560]  he supported carbon taxes in the past and I've had from a climate depot
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:40.240]  Mark Moreno who's worked in the Senate on saying he doesn't like Mitt Romney and
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:44.120]  we got Lord Moncton on only for two three segments he's on about a host of
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:47.160]  breaking environmental news also birth certificate news he makes the joke that
[02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:51.360]  he found his birth certificate in Hawaii that's really funny I've got a oh I've
[02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:56.080]  got a Lord Moncton 2012 for president pin because he's you know he says so of
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:09:58.600]  course he doesn't have fake names he didn't give up his citizenship in
[02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:02.160]  Indonesia so I guess he's more a US citizen than Obama actually is but but
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:04.800]  let me ask you this because you've been the head of the UK Independence Party
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:08.760]  bringing it from nowhere to second you know the fastest growing now one of the
[02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:13.320]  biggest parties now you've seen the inside of all this I understand hey if
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:17.840]  we if the Republicans got you that supported Ron Paul got cheated that was
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:22.560]  clear fraud then why not have some influence by endorsing Romney but what
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:26.640]  are we getting I mean I don't know if you've been following this Lord Moncton
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:29.680]  but it's the big hot issue before we digress in the other big issues you're
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:34.240]  here with us with an update for today what's your gut take on this looking in
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:37.720]  from the outside but also the inside spending a lot of time each year here in
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:42.640]  the US and sharing a lot of Ron Paul's views I think what's happened here is
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:48.440]  that it's become clear that Romney now has enough delegates to take the
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:53.560]  convention virtually whatever anybody else does and there comes a point where
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:58.640]  it isn't all that sensible to try fighting on and I think Ron Paul has
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:04.360]  done very well hanging in there for as long as he has with the sensible views
[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:09.520]  that he has and I hope that the part of the deal that may have been done here is
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:14.520]  that he will be given some sort of cabinet post so that he can exercise some
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:19.440]  sensible influence over Mitt Romney or Willard or whatever his name is because
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:25.400]  the the difficulty that I see is that Romney hasn't really been very steady
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:30.920]  on matters of policy at one moment he is all in favor of doing nothing about
[02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:34.240]  climate change the next moment he's demanding that we must have cap and
[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:38.400]  trade of the same on a portion the same on many other issues some of them very
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:42.480]  serious issues on which by now a politician hoping to hold the highest
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:48.760]  office in the land ought to have settled views so I am concerned that he is and
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:53.920]  all things to all men candidate and I do think that what we need and I'm sure
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:59.360]  you agree with this is somebody like Ron Paul who has clear views and to my
[02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:03.560]  mind very sensible views on what now needs to be done it's very clear that
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:10.360]  the number one issue is to reduce and reduce substantially the annual deficit
[02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:14.760]  of the US government because you're now borrowing very large amounts of money
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:19.480]  from China and anyone who borrows money from another government is no longer a
[02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:23.760]  free and sovereign nation you become in hoc to your debtor and your debtor then
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:28.360]  starts calling the tune I haven't heard enough from any of the candidates except
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:32.880]  Ron Paul about this very serious issue Romney has been more or less entirely
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:37.560]  silent on it and I don't think that's acceptable either all right so so so
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:41.400]  there's the perspective and I see what you're saying if he's not gonna win why
[02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:45.360]  not try to influence and I guess if Ron Paul did get a cabinet position and
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:49.920]  actually I just don't see them doing that if he gets strung along and doesn't
[02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:55.600]  get it we know they got manipulated and I just think my gut is Lord Montyn the
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:59.920]  supporters aren't gonna buy that they're not it's not that they don't
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:04.640]  understand it I just think if Romney hadn't supported abortion and carbon
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:08.240]  taxes and written Obamacare then it would be a little different if he was a
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:13.320]  little more mainline conservative he's so liberal so globalist in the past but
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:16.920]  then I see your argument we'll get Ron Paul in there as a counterbalance I
[02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:20.840]  mean I understand those perspectives it's just that Ron Paul's never
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:24.920]  compromised on anything and I would see it as a compromise here you know what
[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:30.760]  we've got a reserve judgment this far my only issue is that the campaign played
[02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:34.040]  along even though I looked at it politically and said they can't use
[02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:37.520]  delegates and then try to unseat him that would be seen as stealing an
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:41.960]  election but they use that I guess to keep the momentum going and and that it
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:47.000]  would then be a betrayal that's my issue Christopher Montyn Lord Montyn I can
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:52.640]  see that very much and I think we now have to hope and pray that Mitt Romney
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:57.000]  who does look like ending up as the official Republican candidate is going
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:02.640]  to toughen up his his act and raise his game I think he does have one advantage
[02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:07.880]  which is these days frighteningly rare in politics he has set up and grown and
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:12.120]  run what is now a very successful international business and at least
[02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:17.160]  therefore he knows how many beans make five which is more than can be said of
[02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:21.080]  the amateur I think that's the epithet everybody's now using of President
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:26.560]  Obama after a book by a New York Times journalist of all people called the
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:31.760]  amateur describing the really catastrophic catastrophic performance of
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:36.760]  Obama in office how Obama thinks there's 47 states absolutely let's shift gears
[02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:42.440]  out of that I mean not 47 57 states I'm now channeling Obama not 50 Lord Montyn
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:47.320]  shifting gears what's the latest you've got breaking from Hawaii well it's very
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:53.680]  clear now that somebody in the Hawaiian Health Department knew that the
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:59.720]  document that now appears on the White House website is a forgery it's clear it
[02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:04.840]  is a forgery that much we've discussed before but it's now clear and I did an
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:09.040]  analysis on this for my fellow hereditary peers those are the people who don't
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:13.040]  have a seat or vote but still take an interest in politics but have a
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:18.520]  historic connection with the House of Lords and we I do papers for them from
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:23.200]  time to time and they do them for me and what I've discovered is that when you
[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:29.560]  analyze exactly what happened how this document came to be requested how it
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:34.720]  found its way to the White House it's very clear that even if the White House
[02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:39.120]  didn't know this document was a forgery and there's a certain amount of evidence
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:43.440]  that actually it didn't there's a lot of evidence that in fact it's really
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:48.360]  compelling and overwhelming evidence that somebody and I don't know who in the
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:54.520]  Hawaiian Health Department knows that document to be a forgery and everybody
[02:15:54.520 --> 02:16:00.240]  from governor downwards is very very carefully looking the other way but I
[02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:05.040]  don't think that's now going to be a sustainable position I've had advice
[02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:08.640]  from a constitutional expert about that he says first of all those who try to
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:13.240]  say this is an inconsequential matter an issue that doesn't really matter it's a
[02:16:13.240 --> 02:16:16.920]  historical clause in the Constitution that no longer has any relevance these
[02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:21.840]  he says flatly are incorrect you amend the Constitution or you abide by it and
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:29.160]  what should now happen is there must be an opening up of the official record of
[02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:37.160]  Mr. Obama's birth to independent forensic scrutiny here in Hawaii unless and
[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:43.160]  until that is done there is now in my view sufficient doubt about where he
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:48.800]  was born to justify even his supporters from withholding their vote from him at
[02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:53.160]  the next election on the ground that they can't be sure that he is the
[02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:58.240]  president and that he himself by endorsing the posting up on the White
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:03.640]  House website of a document which is a manifest and maladroit forgery and then
[02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:09.880]  by doing absolutely nothing about it when an eminent sheriff has found after
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:14.320]  six months examination that it is a forgery they they can now I think must
[02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:20.260]  now legitimately withhold their vote from this man unless and until he clears the
[02:17:20.260 --> 02:17:24.520]  matter up by taking the blindingly obvious step he has not taken so far
[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:29.680]  which is to say to the department in Hawaii come on let's open up the forensic
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:33.760]  record to lead original record to forensic inspect inspection by both
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:37.480]  sides so that there can be no more nonsense about this the fact that
[02:17:37.480 --> 02:17:43.120]  neither he nor Hawaii have done this and that he in fact as his very first
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:49.240]  executive order when he took office on the first full day of his holding office
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:56.000]  was an order sealing all his personal past record a most extraordinary first
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:59.960]  executive order by a president narcissistic in the extreme you may
[02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:03.800]  think but why did he do this he did this presumably
[02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:08.000]  inferentially because he has something to because it was the sort of
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:13.160]  Damocles hangover said and expanding the mainstream media acts like we've been
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:16.840]  given proof after proof first they said we'd always been given the original and
[02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:20.880]  it was clearly a receipt that wasn't even a copy of the original they said
[02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:25.280]  nothing else existed then they gave us the ridiculous fake then Abercrombie
[02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:28.920]  right before that the governor of Hawaii where you are said to the reporter
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:33.320]  well I've looked it's not there Obama has a problem that's a quote a few months
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:38.240]  later it pops up they never let's forensic inspection happen the AP and
[02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:43.440]  others had a different weird copy all different colors different fonts I mean
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:47.720]  this is crazy and the fact that they've sealed all their records they said it
[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:51.480]  was a conspiracy theory that he'd never been named Barry Sataro that was later
[02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:56.320]  confirmed the records caught out in Kenya they say looks like theft there
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:19:00.840]  wouldn't be records if it hadn't been there this is pretty scary the blackmail
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:05.920]  potential of this Lord Monkton well this is another big problem that there are
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:11.160]  people who know exactly what the true position is at least two as far as I
[02:19:11.160 --> 02:19:17.000]  can track down here in Hawaii no exactly what that position is and you know it
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:22.440]  would not surprise me given the visit here last week by Sheriff Arpaio's
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:27.440]  cold case posse it would not surprise me at all that they are on the trail of
[02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:32.440]  these people and will eventually be working with the Hawaii Police Department
[02:19:32.440 --> 02:19:38.400]  to feel some colors as we say in in Britain I don't think this is going to
[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:42.240]  go away now and I think it's not going to go away for one rather startling
[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:47.200]  reason which given to me by the the very eminent constitutional expert who might
[02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:51.720]  consult what Lord Monkton say that we're gonna break tell us about this big
[02:19:51.720 --> 02:19:56.040]  bombshell on the other side and then we'll continue with phone calls Adam

[02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:18.720]  of time with him I'd like to welcome him back next week for a full hour if he
[02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:22.360]  can do it we've got all this breaking Ron Paul news and I've got some other
[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:26.480]  important news I need to hit before this hour's up so what was the big intel you
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:31.200]  got from a constitutional scholar Lord Moncton? This is an experienced
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:34.280]  lawyer long in practice in constitutional law he's appeared before
[02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:40.400]  the Supreme Court he knows his way around and he said that any defendant who
[02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:46.600]  was accused of a criminal offense created by the law signed by President
[02:24:46.600 --> 02:24:52.400]  Obama into law is entitled to raise in his defense the question whether or not
[02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:56.920]  the president is the president the law the law and therefore the offense he's
[02:24:56.920 --> 02:25:04.040]  charged with an offense at all and he can insist on his right to go in the
[02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:09.520]  person of forensic experts acting for his attorneys to have a look at the
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:14.840]  original record in Hawaii to satisfy himself that that record is indeed a
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:20.200]  genuine record of your president's birth and this is virtually bound to happen
[02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:24.320]  according to this lawyer he said it's only a matter of time before attorneys
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:29.200]  for one defendant or another accused of some crime signed into law by the
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:33.120]  president that information could be subpoenaed of this defense absolutely
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:38.560]  they they have the absolute right the president is Brady versus Maryland 49
[02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:43.720]  years ago in which it was said that the prosecution has to facilitate the
[02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:48.320]  defense by making sure that any information or documentation in their
[02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:53.000]  hands or under their control or accessible to them which in any way might
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:57.920]  tend to exonerate or exculpate the accused must be made available to the
[02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:03.680]  defense it's an absolute overriding right of the defense and this is going to
[02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:07.080]  happen it's only a matter of time he says it may happen between now and the
[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:10.600]  election it may happen after the election but at some point it is going to
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:15.000]  happen and then the whole shabby house of cards is going to come down and in the
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:20.460]  meantime Alex if anyone wants to find out more about this and realize that you
[02:26:20.460 --> 02:26:24.480]  and I are not just pointy-headed birth that's but there is really good reason
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:31.760]  to doubt this then I have sent to your website info wars dot com a copy of the
[02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:36.000]  briefing paper that I wrote for my fellow hereditary peers so it is available
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:40.280]  for anyone to just download let me let me stop you Lord Monkton I'll find out
[02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:44.000]  what address you sent that to to make sure we posted info wars dot com but we
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:49.200]  can also find it at scienceandpublicpolicy.org is it up there you
[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:52.360]  won't find it there because it's not really within their subject matter but
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:56.760]  it is within yours so I've sent it to your your folk Chris and Jaren have both
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:27:00.880]  got it and so you better put it up on your website we will post it right now
[02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:04.200]  it's a 20 page document we did get I don't believe it's posted yet it'll be
[02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:10.520]  posted by a Don Kurtz on vacation right now right now at info wars dot com it'll
[02:27:10.520 --> 02:27:14.960]  be up there in the next five minutes excellent so anyone who wants to study
[02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:19.280]  this for themselves and see why it is that I think that Sheriff Arpaio is
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:23.760]  probably right and I have independently talked to forensic experts on
[02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:28.200]  everything from the typewriting to the electronic layers of which the document
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:32.320]  is composed you'll find a summary of the points that impressed me as
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:36.080]  suggesting that there is something very desperately wrong with the document now
[02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:40.600]  clearing on the White House website and let's be clear about this it is not we
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:46.880]  Alex who are raising the the the issue here it is President Obama who's raised
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:51.440]  this issue here raised these doubts created these legitimate doubts about
[02:27:51.440 --> 02:27:56.280]  where he was born by putting up on the White House website a manifestly
[02:27:56.280 --> 02:28:00.960]  obviously bogus document you'll see that from my peers briefing paper when you
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:04.760]  get it it's an obviously bogus document there is no argument about it it is
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:11.200]  definitely bogus and the question is this he knows now that a serious sheriff
[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:16.720]  is saying it's bogus he knows now that this is spreading it can't be put back
[02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:20.560]  in his box court case is happening all over America well it's just like the
[02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:23.960]  global warming crowd being caught in fraud after fraud their house of guards
[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:28.760]  is imploding these are for jurors fraudsters and it's the same people this
[02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:34.320]  is the thing what has happened is that the left has now become so fixated on
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:38.920]  whatever the party line happens to be that they are now incapable of
[02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:44.400]  recognizing that there even is such a thing as right and wrong or true and
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:49.360]  false the only thing they recognize is what is expedient that backs the party
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:54.120]  line and what is inexpedient because it doesn't and that's the only measure that
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:29:00.240]  they now use there is no morality left in the left they've abandoned all
[02:29:00.240 --> 02:29:05.080]  reason they've abandoned all understanding that some things are true
[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:08.840]  and some things are not true some things are right and some things are not right
[02:29:08.840 --> 02:29:14.360]  and until they get back to that they are going to continue the long inexperible
[02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:19.360]  decline that began under Ron Reagan and Margaret Thatcher with the collapse of
[02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:24.200]  Soviet communism and soon we will have the collapse of communism here once

[02:33:12.080 --> 02:33:16.400]  okay let me hit some news here real quick before we got a more your calls
[02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:20.960]  and Adam Kokesh coming up on the Ron Paul front see I get Lord Moncton's
[02:33:20.960 --> 02:33:25.720]  perspective of okay it's a dead end for Ron Paul try to influence Romney but you
[02:33:25.720 --> 02:33:30.400]  would want to communicate that as the new strategy to your supporters first
[02:33:30.400 --> 02:33:34.160]  and that's not what happened Ron Paul puts out one message that oh we're
[02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:38.560]  gonna win we're gonna get the delegates we're gonna overthrow it and then
[02:33:38.560 --> 02:33:41.680]  meanwhile you know a month ago hey we're suspending campaigning but that's not
[02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:45.120]  what we really mean and then Rand Paul's on the show and acts like it's all
[02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:49.880]  over people are like Jones don't say that's what they're saying again it's
[02:33:49.880 --> 02:33:56.560]  it's it's delusional and I'm just telling you how the listeners how the
[02:33:56.560 --> 02:34:01.240]  supporters of Ron Paul and Rand Paul are gonna take this and it's incredibly
[02:34:01.240 --> 02:34:06.520]  negative but again they've done great job with their votes with what they've
[02:34:06.520 --> 02:34:10.720]  done they're they're great men I'm not saying they're bad guys but if they're
[02:34:10.720 --> 02:34:13.960]  trying to merge the Republican Party we need to let them know we don't like
[02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:18.280]  what's happening before I go back to your calls and Adam Kokesh I want to shift
[02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:22.240]  gears here this story is up on the drudge report drudge report calm and
[02:34:22.240 --> 02:34:27.880]  originates from info wars calm green police Miami Beach to make recycling
[02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:33.160]  compulsory $2,500 fine now they've already started this in Australia England
[02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:38.680]  and areas and in New York what is it you know $1,000 fine for cat litter in the
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:42.760]  ladies trash and they come and search your trash and they get block captains
[02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:48.800]  who get part of the tickets they're like meter mates $2,000 a day fines for dust
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:52.680]  in your barn I mean this is meant to shut us down the big factories they're
[02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:58.680]  exempt animal ID premises ID all of this Audie's infamous green police
[02:34:58.680 --> 02:35:01.760]  Super Bowl commercial may not be far off although the makers were in the San
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:06.640]  Francisco Chronicles saying we're here to acclimate you this is the plan Miami
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:12.200]  Beach has passed an ordinance that makes recycling compulsory with those who
[02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:19.120]  fell to comply under threat of fines of $2,500 Miami Herald reports now it's
[02:35:19.120 --> 02:35:26.440]  just like all the other garbage we see this is tyranny this is not it made off
[02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:29.480]  can steal money only after incredible pressure does he get in trouble
[02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:34.080]  course I can still money doesn't get in trouble all of this I mean that's the
[02:35:34.080 --> 02:35:38.320]  real crime going on and no amount of tax raising no amount of this is going to
[02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:43.440]  keep the government going it's designed to collapse now I want to go shift gears
[02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:51.880]  into some other areas I saw a story out of WHTC radio saying what if truly a
[02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:56.160]  moot point and they go on to say so what if they're putting in all over the
[02:35:56.160 --> 02:36:01.400]  country pre-crime cameras that track what you're doing if you don't just walk
[02:36:01.400 --> 02:36:04.200]  straight on the subway or on the sidewalk if you stop and read something
[02:36:04.200 --> 02:36:08.400]  the police come that suspicious and they say so what you know it's a it's a moot
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:13.240]  point and of course in the Daily Mail picked up on our article afterwards
[02:36:13.240 --> 02:36:16.720]  new surveillance cameras will use computer eyes to find pre-crimes by
[02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:21.160]  detecting suspicious behavior and calling for guards and we wrote an
[02:36:21.160 --> 02:36:24.400]  article about this in the Daily Mail picked it up that we could show folks
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:28.200]  our article about San Francisco getting pre-crime cameras that's actually the
[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:33.800]  article fact here it is right here San Francisco to get pre-crime surveillance
[02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:37.280]  cameras this came out yesterday it was also in the drudge report drudge
[02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:42.080]  report.com system alerts authorities to suspicious behavior before crime is
[02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:48.480]  committed Paul Joseph Watson info wars.com and I saw all these sites say
[02:36:48.480 --> 02:36:54.080]  so what it keeps us safe like this article from earlier this year actually a
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:59.360]  May of last year look at this document cam guys high-tech cameras to record
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:06.080]  kids food choices in school cafeterias ABC News Department of Defense grants
[02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:10.640]  San Antonio, Texas everything they eat is tracked and the kids are going to get
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:16.120]  in trouble if they don't finish their apple laptops at the school issues free
[02:37:16.120 --> 02:37:20.080]  that you pay forward taxes they're not free you're paying for that where should
[02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:23.200]  I put this to get a document cam shot where would you where should I put it
[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:30.280]  here there I'll put it wherever you want okay so there's the article right
[02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:35.760]  there people watching on prison planet dot TV yes this is real the system has
[02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:42.160]  always admitted that this is the plan this has always been the plan is a total
[02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:46.240]  control grid to restrict your guns to restrict your movement if you're not a
[02:37:46.240 --> 02:37:49.080]  good globalist they're going to turn your passport off they're not going to let
[02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:54.560]  you buy and sell they've now said this 30,000 armed drones checkpoints TSA
[02:37:54.560 --> 02:38:00.160]  everything hiring pedophiles at every department to run it all real this is
[02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:07.120]  what tyranny looks like and so I see people making jokes going so what let
[02:38:07.120 --> 02:38:11.400]  the cops have pre-crime stuff it's like license plate reading cameras in the
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:14.800]  future they can I saw the police five years ago in Austin went to the Texas
[02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:20.520]  legislature try to get a law pass that people that had criticized police that
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:24.120]  that would be in a database when they pull you over or when a license plate
[02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:29.320]  reader hits you so now you were like a yellow star that you're a patriot we
[02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:32.440]  already had the police under orders pulling over people Ron Paul stickers
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:37.040]  when we protested Bilderberg do you know what this is going to be used for in the
[02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:43.600]  hands of the tyrants I look we're being totally enslaved this stuff is coming
[02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:48.240]  down on us so you want smart cameras watching everybody it's used to watch
[02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:56.080]  kids at school okay this is what's going on this is outrageous what's
[02:38:56.080 --> 02:39:00.840]  happening so I guess the kids deserve to have smart cameras watching them now
[02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:05.320]  even in the bathrooms they now record naked children in the showers and say
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:08.760]  it's freedom there's nothing these crooks won't do you know I remember three
[02:39:08.760 --> 02:39:13.000]  years ago I'd talk about laptops in California and in Pennsylvania where they
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.920]  admitted they were watching the kids at home with them and people didn't believe
[02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:19.360]  me they didn't believe me seven years ago when Google put out a press release to
[02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:22.840]  stockholders saying we watch people over their cameras at home without them
[02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:27.280]  knowing now the CIA director admits it and people are like you're a cook for not
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:31.680]  wanting the government to watch you without warrants I'm like what I'm a
[02:39:31.680 --> 02:39:36.160]  cook because I don't want it see it goes from it isn't happening to all the
[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:39.560]  death panels aren't happening to hey you don't want death panels you don't want
[02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:43.520]  people to have a right to have the government kill them this isn't your
[02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:46.280]  right to die it's the right for the government to kill you because they don't
[02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:49.000]  because you're now under socialist health care they want the money and then
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:52.960]  the control they don't want you to get the health care it's how it works we have
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:56.080]  Adam Cakesh lined up guys
[02:39:56.080 --> 02:39:59.360]  fantastic we're getting him connected right now in Skype to get his take on
[02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:03.360]  all this but you know it's just a lot of things like the Ron Paul people
[02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:07.120]  starting to endorse kind of neocons like Ted Cruz and I get the fact that he's
[02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:10.800]  running to get somebody even worse but I just I don't get that I mean it's just
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:13.880]  they're becoming mainline they're being co-opted not the other way around
[02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:17.840]  Ron Paul saying go you know we're not going to win the delegates now but go
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:22.320]  and sit there is my little pretty block you know for my son to get some
[02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:26.760]  position and by the way be respectful of a Republican criminal system that's
[02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:31.120]  robs and steals and sells torture and secret arrest and stole the election from
[02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:36.960]  Ron Paul I mean don't you know that's gonna be political suicide for you guys
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:42.720]  and and and then the system wins instead of keeping the Liberty movement going
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:47.000]  don't you understand that I got a bunch of callers we're gonna try to get to you
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:50.800]  but I wanted to get Adam Cakesh who's you know had his own TV show syndicated
[02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:56.000]  radio been a huge Ron Paul supporter Marine Corps you know veteran of
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:59.600]  Fallujah and other events over in Afghanistan spoke out against it once
[02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:04.600]  he got home he's been a huge Ron Paul supporter he started freaking out a few
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:07.240]  weeks ago and I everybody said are you gonna talk about this I said I'm gonna
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:12.760]  reserve judgment because I'm not sure yet and I'm still not but now I've gone
[02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:17.520]  from 17 years of supporting Ron Paul and appreciating the work and his voting
[02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:21.600]  record and saying he's something special and so's ran to saying maybe they're
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:25.920]  more like mainline you know far-right politicians kind of like a centered
[02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:30.120]  to men do I hate him like Diane Feinstein do I hate him like you know
[02:41:30.120 --> 02:41:36.640]  Chucky Schumer no or you know somebody like you know somebody like Harry Reid
[02:41:36.640 --> 02:41:42.560]  no they they don't they're overall better than the others but wow then I get
[02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:47.360]  told if I go there I need to be respectful in Tampa you know that that's
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:53.160]  rubbing an in right there that's rubbing an in right there and so maybe we
[02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:56.680]  should get people like Cruz on his right of precedent and you know really really
[02:41:56.680 --> 02:42:01.840]  maybe he's rolled over and shown a new leaf to Liberty but Adam
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:04.680]  co-cage host of Adam versus the man you're out of Bilderberg with us that
[02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:10.960]  was awesome what is your overall take on this why have you gotten soured more and
[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:15.000]  more talk towards the Paul system I mean is it that it looks like we're just
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:18.760]  taken for granted and that now they've got the you know the sexier cooler
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:25.240]  mainline rhinos you know with their pacemakers I mean what's going on here
[02:42:25.240 --> 02:42:30.080]  well thanks Alex for the introduction but I do kind of take issue with that
[02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:36.280]  characterization of of souring on the Ron Paul movement because it is a
[02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:40.160]  distinct sort of sub movement of the broader level
[02:42:40.160 --> 02:42:44.080]  let me stop you I'm not saying you're showering I mean Liberty goes on the
[02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:48.320]  great but but the people made Ron Paul and Rand Paul and I'm not I'm saying
[02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:53.720]  showering to what the upper echelon is doing well that's not what people are
[02:42:53.720 --> 02:43:00.240]  souring to people are are really confused and frustrated now with what
[02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:04.920]  they're seeing out of Ron Paul Inc. out of the Ron Paul campaign starting with
[02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:10.000]  the statement about three weeks ago from Jesse Benton effectively conceding the
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:14.480]  race before it was I don't know if you can say officially conceded now saying
[02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:19.040]  they didn't concede it exactly political doublespeak right and there was a lot of
[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:24.520]  mixed messaging coming out of the Ron Paul campaign and I want to not be a
[02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:30.560]  sycophant to Ron Paul and not be someone who doesn't question him but I don't
[02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:35.880]  think that the failings of the Ron Paul campaign are a result of Ron himself
[02:43:35.880 --> 02:43:40.080]  necessarily selling out possibly being taken advantage of as you've been
[02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:44.160]  following I'm sure the travails of Jesse Benton and how many people that he
[02:43:44.160 --> 02:43:50.320]  managed to piss off in the grassroots but there is a theory now and that and
[02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:53.400]  I'm going to be testing this I'm have some interviews coming up for my show
[02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:58.640]  about where Jesse Benton came from and from what I know from reliable sources
[02:43:58.640 --> 02:44:03.920]  he was actually sleeping and living with another woman when he first got picked
[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:09.120]  up by the Ron Paul campaign in 2007 and then ended up marrying Jesse or Ron Paul's
[02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:13.920]  granddaughter Valerie Pied and has worked his way into the organization since
[02:44:13.920 --> 02:44:19.400]  then clearly it's very least getting overpaid and overtrusted with authority
[02:44:19.400 --> 02:44:23.680]  that he doesn't deserve well in over his head pretty incompetent as a campaign
[02:44:23.680 --> 02:44:28.080]  manager but well I have to say I've had high level people in the campaign off
[02:44:28.080 --> 02:44:32.320]  record tell me that and I mean the the most senior people just say they do not
[02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:35.600]  know what they're doing and I and I think we should give them a benefit of
[02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:39.360]  the doubt and say for now that's what's happening I mean to be clear here you're
[02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:42.920]  saying you take issue with the souring point I meant souring with yes what the
[02:44:42.920 --> 02:44:47.840]  echelon what the leadership of campaign for liberty Ron Paul ink was doing we
[02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:53.560]  here as original supporters myself 17 years we have a right to say hey you
[02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:58.120]  know suddenly don't have the delegates contest suddenly Mitt Romney's great I
[02:44:58.120 --> 02:45:04.360]  mean it's I mean Mitt Romney has got a pretty bad record and Paul but to stick
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:09.160]  with what's happening with Ron because Ron is the center of this he is the
[02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:14.760]  center of the movement he is the one who commands the the organization of Ron
[02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:19.680]  Paul ink campaign for liberty his presidential campaign the Liberty pack
[02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:23.000]  various other organizations that are all a part of this that have gotten Jesse
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:26.840]  Betten over half a million dollars in the last year in salary and various
[02:45:26.840 --> 02:45:31.920]  kickbacks but Trig V. Olson was involved with all of the color revolutions as
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:36.040]  been a longtime interventionist and was the adult in the room that Mitch
[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:41.720]  McConnell sent to help run the Kentucky race for Rand Paul that Jesse Betten
[02:45:41.720 --> 02:45:48.240]  managed and after the Republicans tried to shoot ran down right and Trig
[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:52.560]  V. Olson is now a consultant for the presidential campaign whose consulting
[02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:56.720]  firm has gotten over two hundred thousand dollars from them but what Rand Paul
[02:45:56.720 --> 02:46:00.960]  represents is not what Ron Paul represents and I think most of us have
[02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:05.320]  always known this and he's been kind of open about it and and people have had
[02:46:05.320 --> 02:46:09.640]  the same delusional thinking that they have about Ron Paul applied to him and
[02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:14.040]  I don't mean to say that it's delusional to admire Ron Paul for all that he's
[02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:17.960]  accomplished for the millions of hearts and minds he is free for the
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:22.240]  incredible let's shift gears on limited time for those that don't know
[02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:24.800]  Ron Paul's come out and said okay looks like we're not gonna be able to win with
[02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:28.800]  20% of the delegates go there and be respectful that be respectful of all
[02:46:28.800 --> 02:46:33.040]  the stuff the Republican machines done I don't like that and I'm you know I'm
[02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:36.280]  allowed as an evil American to have my views here and Ron Paul said four years
[02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:40.240]  ago we put them on the map early on with half their contributions from my show
[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:44.920]  and we've been there the entire time I'm telling you my listeners 95% we've got
[02:46:44.920 --> 02:46:48.600]  polls going are very upset I'm just saying the campaign needs to be clear
[02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:52.680]  about this and if people have been speaking for them that aren't right or
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:55.680]  if things have gotten off track they need to get back on track right now
[02:46:55.680 --> 02:46:59.880]  that's my question to you Adam with your hand on the pulse of the grassroots is
[02:46:59.880 --> 02:47:04.320]  this is explosively dangerous to the whole Paul ink which I want to continue
[02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:10.720]  and be constitutional as I see it being dangerous well in a way Ron Paul ink is
[02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:16.120]  now at odds with the movement that Ron inspired and that's the challenge here
[02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:19.640]  and really this falls at Ron's feet and you're correct and Alex I hope to see
[02:47:19.640 --> 02:47:23.600]  you in Tampa are you gonna be there I'm you know I wasn't gonna go I was let
[02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:26.640]  everybody just go but now that we're being told we behave ourselves I think
[02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:32.840]  I am gonna have to come just so that you can disbehave sure well there's this
[02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:36.920]  problem between the grassroots in the campaign now because of lack of
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:40.200]  direction and that really does fall at Ron's feet you know I'm organizing the
[02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:44.640]  veterans for on Paul March on the RNC Ron Paul is the choice of the troops dot
[02:47:44.640 --> 02:47:48.560]  com having gotten more campaign better behave yourself wait a minute don't you
[02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:53.960]  embarrass Mittens well we're going to go and make a scene and do what Ron Paul
[02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:58.760]  said in his latest email saying that we are going to force the establishment to
[02:47:58.760 --> 02:48:02.200]  listen to the Liberty message we are going to force them we are gonna be in
[02:48:02.200 --> 02:48:06.040]  their faces with that so I'm running with that and so what's going on here
[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:09.840]  we've got a mixed message I guess to make Romney feel good and cozy up to Rand
[02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:14.280]  and then you've got Paul with his message to the original troops well
[02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:17.840]  everybody's looking at Ron Paul and the million dollar question is what is he
[02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:21.680]  gonna do with all of this momentum is he gonna demand a speaking spot and if
[02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:25.120]  he does what's he gonna say is he gonna call that's not enough that's not enough
[02:48:25.120 --> 02:48:29.200]  we want to go take it over and have a huge fracas or run third party to inject
[02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:34.760]  real issues or have the culmination of the Ron Paul revolution be secretary of
[02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:38.960]  the transportation department Rand Paul and I don't think that's gonna cut it
[02:48:38.960 --> 02:48:44.680]  either so there's this idea that the Republican Party is the face of the
[02:48:44.680 --> 02:48:48.960]  military industrial complex the real purpose of the Republican establishment
[02:48:48.960 --> 02:48:54.640]  is to subvert the legitimate American will to freedom the desire to create a
[02:48:54.640 --> 02:48:59.560]  truly American society and perverted with interventionism to pervert it with
[02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:02.960]  the modern warfare the opposite of what George Washington stood for Empire
[02:49:02.960 --> 02:49:07.400]  America versus Republic America and that's why Jesse Benton may have been
[02:49:07.400 --> 02:49:13.360]  sent by the establishment to get trig v. Olson into Ron's inner circle and to
[02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:17.720]  support Rand Paul and to convince him to convince Ron to do all these things
[02:49:17.720 --> 02:49:21.840]  that are contrary to his message so Ron is a human being are you saying this is
[02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:27.280]  idiocy or you saying there is a Benedict Arnold in the wood pile it's both it is
[02:49:27.280 --> 02:49:31.480]  absolutely both I can tell you decisively it is both and and and as
[02:49:31.480 --> 02:49:35.480]  Ron Paul sports we have to acknowledge his shortcomings as well is not the
[02:49:35.480 --> 02:49:40.080]  greatest organizational leader he is not the greatest commander of the movement
[02:49:40.080 --> 02:49:44.000]  he is not going to be the one who is going to give direction and organize and
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:49.160]  take charge and to be fair to be absolutely perfectly fair as we as we
[02:49:49.160 --> 02:49:53.600]  should be with Ron he's demonstrated poor judgment in the past if you look at
[02:49:53.600 --> 02:49:57.320]  the racist newsletters and I'm not saying that Ron is racist that's absolute
[02:49:57.320 --> 02:50:01.480]  crap but as he admitted himself it was a failure of oversight business they had
[02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:06.680]  dozens of people 10 or 15 different versions yeah so I don't know how much
[02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:13.520]  it's Ron's actual shortcomings as an organizational leader and you know or his
[02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:18.120]  gullibility and how far that goes to explaining what's going on but on the
[02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:22.640]  other side you also have the Benedict Arnold's you have Rand Paul now
[02:50:22.640 --> 02:50:26.280]  endorsing Mitt Romney and there may be some strategy behind that but clearly
[02:50:26.280 --> 02:50:29.880]  he's not serving the message I mean we should not be surprised that war
[02:50:29.880 --> 02:50:34.320]  mongering Rand Paul who voted for the act of war against Iran of sanctions is
[02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:38.720]  now supporting the other pro-war candidate you're calling him war mongering I
[02:50:38.720 --> 02:50:43.480]  think he went with that as a second path or a third path to not having war well
[02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:47.200]  I that's like hey let's just have a little bit of war let's just have a
[02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:50.720]  little bit of tyranny and fascism but there are lots of stay there final
[02:50:50.720 --> 02:50:53.720]  segment I'll be going to overdrive and take calls and I don't have time I got
[02:50:53.720 --> 02:50:58.960]  the nightly news to do man this is crazy but we as Ron Paul supporters we put
[02:50:58.960 --> 02:51:03.400]  them on the map we're allowed to get angry hi this is Alex Jones did you know

[02:54:16.680 --> 02:54:22.880]  people the fight goes on talking to Adam Kokesh I've talked to senior people
[02:54:22.880 --> 02:54:27.240]  they've sat out there when they've been guest on the show senior in the campaign
[02:54:27.240 --> 02:54:30.400]  and said what's going on here and there and they're like oh man they don't know
[02:54:30.400 --> 02:54:34.560]  what they're doing that they're like 25 years old the people that are older on
[02:54:34.560 --> 02:54:38.840]  the campaign actually aren't running things but I never said all that on air
[02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:42.360]  so I want to think it's been because nobody's perfect when you're in the
[02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:48.880]  arena the fog of political war all of that but whoever told Ron Paul to come
[02:54:48.880 --> 02:54:52.360]  out and say after we're gonna go and fight with the delegates to now well
[02:54:52.360 --> 02:54:56.920]  it's clear we can't win so we're just gonna go and be respectful and and then
[02:54:56.920 --> 02:55:02.080]  ran a little too sweetie cake over Mitt Romney and I understand it's an honor to
[02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:05.440]  get considered for vice president I understand a little lofty power and all
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:10.000]  that but I've been offered power and didn't sell out and I and look I was
[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:13.840]  already very successful probably more so because I didn't sell out I did it my
[02:55:13.840 --> 02:55:18.440]  way as Frank Sinatra would say but because you can't compromise with this
[02:55:18.440 --> 02:55:21.880]  there's no way they're gonna influence Romney it's to be the other way around
[02:55:21.880 --> 02:55:25.520]  and and and I knew instinctively this morning when I got up and saw this and
[02:55:25.520 --> 02:55:29.200]  been out since last night that people weren't gonna go along with this so I
[02:55:29.200 --> 02:55:33.280]  don't know in closing Adam Kokesh we're gonna come back and overdraft take a
[02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:36.400]  few calls folks that are holding but the three four minutes we have left repeat
[02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:40.440]  what you said to me during the break because and folks don't press me to say
[02:55:40.440 --> 02:55:44.720]  names or I will okay about campaign people I didn't want to go here but I'm
[02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:48.400]  not gonna sit by and be told I've got a worship meant Romney it ain't happening
[02:55:48.400 --> 02:55:52.680]  okay and it's not that I love Obama it's just that trick has it has worn out
[02:55:52.680 --> 02:55:56.560]  here I get the left right paradigm I mean it's either the incompetence of the
[02:55:56.560 --> 02:56:00.360]  Benedict Arnold theory what do you think's happening here well just to be
[02:56:00.360 --> 02:56:05.120]  clear I think Rand Paul sold out in his heart a long time ago if he ever had
[02:56:05.120 --> 02:56:08.920]  something to sell out in the first place he was never really a libertarian he
[02:56:08.920 --> 02:56:13.040]  never believed in the cause he voted for sanctions against Iran that's an act of
[02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:16.600]  war that's not like Ron Paul supporting the Defense of Marriage Act which is
[02:56:16.600 --> 02:56:20.520]  something sort of insignificant around the margins and questionable this is an
[02:56:20.520 --> 02:56:24.500]  act of war Rand Paul voted for an act of war the fact that he's supporting mid
[02:56:24.500 --> 02:56:28.160]  Romney over his father for political expediency should really come as no
[02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:33.240]  surprise but what I was saying is that the actions that we see out of Ron Paul
[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:39.120]  Inc. in some ways a betrayal of the grassroots or a combination of the I
[02:56:39.120 --> 02:56:43.920]  don't want to say incompetency but maybe shortcomings of Ron Paul as an
[02:56:43.920 --> 02:56:48.040]  organizational leader on one hand and the corruption of his organization by
[02:56:48.040 --> 02:56:51.560]  leeches and those who would subvert what he is actually trying to do on the
[02:56:51.560 --> 02:56:56.920]  other so how much of each constitutes what's actually happening it's hard to
[02:56:56.920 --> 02:57:00.680]  say but at very least Jesse Benton is a huge leech on the campaign grossly
[02:57:00.680 --> 02:57:06.360]  overpaid incredibly incompetent but we have to see what Ron has been trying to
[02:57:06.360 --> 02:57:10.040]  do here and I gotta say from everything that I've seen I don't have time to get
[02:57:10.040 --> 02:57:13.800]  into each of the points that has led me to the conclusion that Ron Paul
[02:57:13.800 --> 02:57:17.480]  was never running to win in the first place I don't think that that's what he
[02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:21.200]  was doing I think he was running to get as close to winning without actually
[02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:25.280]  being a threat to winning as possible and have as much of an impact on changing
[02:57:25.280 --> 02:57:28.960]  the dialogue and helping take over the party's yeah it's an info war and so
[02:57:28.960 --> 02:57:33.080]  this is really his plan and he's to come out and state that instead of playing
[02:57:33.080 --> 02:57:37.400]  along like he was really moving to win I mean not even really fighting for Texas
[02:57:37.400 --> 02:57:41.520]  California absolutely and they would just be honest with us about the
[02:57:41.520 --> 02:57:45.800]  strategy then it wouldn't be as bad do you agree with me though this is blowing
[02:57:45.800 --> 02:57:50.400]  up big time in their face absolutely and I think that's a reflection of the
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:54.920]  fact that there are leeches on Ron Paul's campaign I think more people like
[02:57:54.920 --> 02:58:00.440]  Jesse Benton tree v. Olson are the ones trying to set a brand for 2016 maybe Doug
[02:58:00.440 --> 02:58:05.000]  weed and John Tate they want to keep the Ron Paul ink gravy train going so they
[02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:09.120]  can keep collecting their outsized salaries but what's what what's more
[02:58:09.120 --> 02:58:13.880]  important here is that Ron has still done an incredible amount to spread the
[02:58:13.880 --> 02:58:17.800]  message he has done don't let don't let this steal our victory don't let the
[02:58:17.800 --> 02:58:22.360]  mainstream media make this a big wedge issue see it for what it is move forward
[02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:25.920]  don't let it be a distraction but let Ron and all them know that we're aware of
[02:58:25.920 --> 02:58:30.920]  what's you know going on and that we particularly don't like what's happening
[02:58:30.920 --> 02:58:34.560]  and it's quite possible that people are being threatened I mean we don't know
[02:58:34.560 --> 02:58:38.160]  these are violent dangerous extremists that have taken over our government and
[02:58:38.160 --> 02:58:41.600]  taken over the Republican Party and turned it into the war party so I hear you

[03:01:06.440 --> 03:01:11.400]  and go back to your calls Doris in Tennessee you're on the air welcome what
[03:01:11.400 --> 03:01:16.400]  do you think of the whole Rand Paul endorsing Romney while Ron Paul's campaign
[03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:21.280]  people were told keep going on keep fighting and Ron Paul saying go to Tampa
[03:01:21.280 --> 03:01:26.440]  be respectful worship Mitt Romney what do you make of this I think we've been
[03:01:26.440 --> 03:01:34.040]  used I think we've just been used I feel you and I listened to your debate with
[03:01:34.040 --> 03:01:40.240]  Webster Tarpley and God knows I do not agree a lot with Webster Tarpley but the
[03:01:40.240 --> 03:01:46.240]  way that he put it about him being a wingman for Romney and we all know that
[03:01:46.240 --> 03:01:54.520]  you know remasonry has evolved into a Lysperian cult and I think Webster
[03:01:54.520 --> 03:01:58.040]  Tarpley had some real good points on that let's do this guys we got co-cache
[03:01:58.040 --> 03:02:04.800]  coming on get get Tarpley on for 30 minutes at least on Sunday show 4 to
[03:02:04.800 --> 03:02:08.840]  6 p.m. as well and just yeah stuff came up yesterday when I was gonna have him on
[03:02:08.840 --> 03:02:11.480]  because he had to go to a TV show or something and because we didn't get it
[03:02:11.480 --> 03:02:15.720]  set up but I want him on Sunday if he'll do it and I want him Skype too
[03:02:15.720 --> 03:02:18.640]  because he'll try to go to telephone what we're gonna make him do Skype I
[03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:22.120]  hear you man we'll get Tarpley on I was just thinking that myself I don't agree
[03:02:22.120 --> 03:02:27.360]  with his socialist ways but he's right about his analysis let's go ahead and
[03:02:27.360 --> 03:02:34.720]  talk to Evan in Florida you're on the air go ahead hey yeah I got a couple
[03:02:34.720 --> 03:02:41.080]  couple comments on the the whole thing um it's very discouraging number one
[03:02:41.080 --> 03:02:45.520]  number two I was a little discouraged when he went and even campaigned in
[03:02:45.520 --> 03:02:51.240]  Florida because he conceded it to Romney now he didn't fight very much in
[03:02:51.240 --> 03:02:57.000]  Texas not none in California really in Florida 0 I mean I've been saying I've
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:02.400]  been having alarms go off the whole time and just going oh my god it's just
[03:03:02.400 --> 03:03:09.200]  terrible I'm wondering if this is gonna this this is a plan to drive us to a
[03:03:09.200 --> 03:03:13.920]  third party and and get a really good organization going a third party well
[03:03:13.920 --> 03:03:16.640]  it's not the wrong one of even one of the third party but he'd have got a ton
[03:03:16.640 --> 03:03:19.480]  of money could have really educated people would have been in the debates
[03:03:19.480 --> 03:03:23.560]  could have actually won maybe I mean he would a lot better than Ross Perot but
[03:03:23.560 --> 03:03:26.920]  it didn't happen and I kept telling people that they're just keeping it
[03:03:26.920 --> 03:03:29.840]  privately I wouldn't say this on air I'd say they're keeping the delegate thing
[03:03:29.840 --> 03:03:33.360]  going to the catapult ran and to get campaign contributions I'm like that's
[03:03:33.360 --> 03:03:36.360]  not that bad because the campaign from Liberty will run good candidates but
[03:03:36.360 --> 03:03:39.760]  then a lot of them aren't good and I'm kind of like well I know all this stuff
[03:03:39.760 --> 03:03:43.000]  but I can't totally prove it so I'm not gonna say it on air and now
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.880]  everything I knew was gonna happen the last few months happened and it makes
[03:03:45.880 --> 03:03:50.280]  me want to throw up and I try to say oh they're playing politics it'll be all
[03:03:50.280 --> 03:03:54.840]  right but my gut says you get out on the air and you attack this or you won't
[03:03:54.840 --> 03:04:02.640]  sleep well tonight what do you say to that Ben Ben Swan had a link on Daily
[03:04:02.640 --> 03:04:07.960]  Paul and there's one there now under the Ron Paul email thing on six things 12
[03:04:07.960 --> 03:04:15.760]  and what it is it's a it's a reference to 11 CFR 42 USC and 2 USC saying that
[03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:22.560]  there is no binding of delegates it's illegal under federal law to bind I know
[03:04:22.560 --> 03:04:28.200]  but I told everybody that they will see it's over though it's over I that's
[03:04:28.200 --> 03:04:31.480]  one thing I don't have to hear this about delegates anymore they were never
[03:04:31.480 --> 03:04:36.200]  going to use those delegates unless they had the majority because the media
[03:04:36.200 --> 03:04:41.120]  would spin it as stealing on election the media would you you understand that
[03:04:41.120 --> 03:04:44.680]  and I had to hear it from my own crew over and over again and I let him
[03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:50.360]  henpeck me but I told them all I said you're wrong I'm right watch and I'm
[03:04:50.360 --> 03:04:54.640]  right again nightly news of course 7 o'clock tonight and there's the Sunday
[03:04:54.640 --> 03:05:20.840]  show we're still here 4 to 6 p.m. Central I'm Alex Jones info wars.com
