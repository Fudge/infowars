[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:09.000 --> 00:36.000]  Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.000]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Hello, and thank you for joining us today. Dr. Rima Lebo and
[00:42.000 --> 00:49.000]  Major General Elbert Stubblebine are over in Europe at the Codex Alimentarius International
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.000]  Private Consortium, setting world law through the already operating World Government World
[00:54.000 --> 01:00.000]  Trade Organization, IMF World Bank, UN NATO. They'll be popping in in about 30 minutes to
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.000]  give us a report from the Codex Alimentarius meeting. Then we're scheduled in about an hour
[01:06.000 --> 01:14.000]  and a half to have Congressman Ron Paul on with us on this July 3rd, 2008 edition. And then,
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  yes, he is scheduled for more than an hour with us. Haven't had him on in a few years. It should
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.000]  be interesting to say the least. He is such a global icon that he cannot be ignored, and
[01:27.000 --> 01:34.000]  we're bringing him on the air for you. And he's now running for parliament in England in
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.000]  the seat where one of the chief Tories quit a few weeks ago because saying that the government
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.000]  was setting up a police state and martial law in England. And so David Ike is running for his
[01:44.000 --> 01:50.000]  place in the British Parliament. I thought we'd have David Ike on for you. And he is scheduled
[01:50.000 --> 02:00.000]  to be joining us from his hotel room. He is on the road. So that is coming up in two hours from
[02:00.000 --> 02:10.000]  now. We will be talking to David Ike on a host of interesting issues. Today is the day
[02:10.000 --> 02:17.000]  Truth Rising will be coming out tonight. Now, I know technically I said July 4th, and that is
[02:17.000 --> 02:33.000]  in 12 hours on the east coast, 13 hours central, 14 hours mountain, 15 hours Pacific. But it will
[02:33.000 --> 02:41.000]  be coming out sometime this evening. I'm a little surprised everybody. You'll see it go live. It
[02:41.000 --> 02:48.000]  could go live as early as four or five o'clock central today. And that way with the CDN systems
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  we have, the content distribution network systems, the servers, we can gauge it and make sure
[02:53.000 --> 02:59.000]  there's no overloading. And then the majority of folks, of course, will hit it tonight at midnight
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  and then throughout the next few days. We'll have people writing that and sitting on top of
[03:03.000 --> 03:08.000]  servers. It downloads super quick. I mean, we had thousands of people hit in-game. The minute
[03:08.000 --> 03:14.000]  it was put up on the web and the servers didn't even hiccup. And that was when we had one CDN
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.000]  eight months ago. Now, we've got two big ones. You can download it in super high quality, download
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  it in flash, super high quality. We're going to have it in a DivX for you to burn right to
[03:23.000 --> 03:33.000]  disk. It's just amazing activist tool that PrisonPlanet.tv is. And yes, the seed funding by
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  you being members of PrisonPlanet.tv and getting my weekly TV reports, my in-studio interviews,
[03:38.000 --> 03:44.000]  special sneak peeks behind the scenes footage, the live fourth hour every day. Usually we do two,
[03:44.000 --> 03:50.000]  three hours a day in studio guest, all of it with PrisonPlanet.tv. So if you don't have a
[03:50.000 --> 03:58.000]  PrisonPlanet.tv membership, I suggest you go over right now. It's $5.95 a month. You can do it
[03:58.000 --> 04:05.000]  month to month. Or if you get a year membership, you get three months free and save, what is it,
[04:05.000 --> 04:16.000]  $18, roughly. It's like $17.85. I just want to get technical. So go on over and get your
[04:16.000 --> 04:22.000]  PrisonPlanet.tv membership now and prepare for the InfoWare. The fourth that you live, back
[04:22.000 --> 04:30.000]  in 1776, the British had just blasted people who wouldn't turn their firearms in. And so they met
[04:30.000 --> 04:36.000]  together and said, we declare independence against tyranny as free human beings. So I suggest you
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.000]  do shoot some fireworks off and eat some barbecue. But also, how about you burn copies of
[04:42.000 --> 04:53.000]  Truth Rising as a true revolutionary on what the day is meant for? Huge news. Stay with us.
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history comes the
[04:58.000 --> 05:04.000]  long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely
[05:04.000 --> 05:09.000]  destroys the official fable forever. Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true
[05:14.000 --> 05:19.000]  perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice. Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate
[05:19.000 --> 05:25.000]  9-11 expose. From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose
[05:25.000 --> 05:30.000]  Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see. Secure your copy of Loose Change Final

[07:53.000 --> 07:59.000]  If you say no to a breathalyzer, you might just get stuck with a needle instead. Hello again, I'm Robert Hadler.
[07:59.000 --> 08:05.000]  Good evening, I'm Michelle Valles, Chief Ardosevethos, hoping to start a program this year with the federal grant.
[08:05.000 --> 08:11.000]  It will train as DWI officers to take you to jail and get a search warrant for your blood.
[08:11.000 --> 08:18.000]  It's our top story tonight. KXAN's Matt Fleener is live along I-35 tonight with one of the Chief's proposal, Matt.
[08:18.000 --> 08:22.000]  Well, Michelle, say you're pulled over on the side of the highway. A cop pulls you out of your car.
[08:22.000 --> 08:29.000]  You can refuse a breathalyzer test all you want. The cop right now can take you to jail to get a search warrant for your blood.
[08:29.000 --> 08:34.000]  But what may change in the future is that officer himself doing the blood test.
[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  Your phone has been updated.
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  Say you've had too much to drink or maybe not even a drop.
[08:41.000 --> 08:48.000]  If an officer thinks you've had one too many, Police Chief Ardosevethos says they should have the ability to draw your blood.
[08:48.000 --> 08:56.000]  My intent is in the future to make it where there's no such thing as a refuser. You can refuse all you want, but we are going to aggressively seek search warrants.
[08:58.000 --> 09:05.000]  The search warrant will give an officer the right to stick a needle in your arm to get a blood alcohol level, replacing the job of a jail nurse.
[09:05.000 --> 09:12.000]  It's about saving money for the taxpayer. If I have an officer that's involved in a case, they're already going to be going to court.
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  Come to find out. The defense attorneys around here are telling people don't give a test.
[09:16.000 --> 09:23.000]  Folks that exercise their right shouldn't be afraid that by doing so, that bubble police officer may stick them in the arm.
[09:23.000 --> 09:27.000]  One defense attorney says police officers shouldn't play nurses well.
[09:27.000 --> 09:32.000]  The officer's going to have liability if they don't do it right. The city's going to have liability if they don't do it right.
[09:32.000 --> 09:39.000]  In today's times of hepatitis and AIDS and everything else, police officers don't want to be out sticking needles in people.
[09:39.000 --> 09:46.000]  If I could snap my fingers tomorrow and say, hey, give me four to five nurses on my staff, I'd be more than happy with the problem.
[09:46.000 --> 09:47.000]  It's not going to work.
[09:47.000 --> 09:51.000]  Instead, Osavado said he's got a whole fleet of workers ready to train.
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.000]  Probably as many as I can get the federal government to train for me.
[09:55.000 --> 10:01.000]  Now, a couple of notes here. The Austin Police Association president learned about this proposal today from us.
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.000]  He said he did not want to comment until he talks more to Chief Art Osavado.
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.000]  And the chief said he would also not ask for taxpayer money specifically from Austin,
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.000]  but instead rely on a federal grant.
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.000]  We're live along I-35 tonight, Matt Fliner, KXX.
[10:16.000 --> 10:23.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[10:26.000 --> 10:33.000]  Number one, they imply in that little newscast that it's free money from the feds.
[10:33.000 --> 10:40.000]  No, they take a dollar of your tax money on average and send about 33 cents back with federal control.
[10:40.000 --> 10:47.000]  But the idiot public has been taught while drinking their fluoride water and taking their mercury injections
[10:47.000 --> 10:54.000]  that it is good for them and that federal money is free and comes down from heaven.
[10:54.000 --> 11:04.000]  Also, in Illinois, in Indiana and other states and some areas of Texas, in Arizona, they take your blood without a warrant.
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.000]  Now, the warrants, and we've had the head of the Texas Bar Association and others on just a few weeks ago,
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  these aren't even real warrants. These are just blank warrants, kind of like the FISA court stuff.
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.000]  They've even gotten rid of that now, just know nothing, not even a rubber stamp.
[11:19.000 --> 11:27.000]  And the cops, this is all about threats. This is about getting them in the position for forced inoculations,
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  setting that precedent. You will hear soon, well, they've been taking blood for years.
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  I mean, why not give you a shot?
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  It's about getting into your space. It's about setting those precedents.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  I have a video clip. We'll play the audio later if we have a chance.
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.000]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com. It's also on WeAreChanged.org. I saw it there where I saw it.
[11:46.000 --> 11:51.000]  And it's a cop in Tennessee, and they pull this guy over randomly, and they say they smell marijuana,
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  and they sure enough find a little bag of marijuana in the car.
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  George Washington smoked. You know, gotta get him.
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.000]  And it's a clean cut guy, and he's saying, yes, sir, he's not doing anything wrong,
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.000]  and they say, I think you got marijuana in your mouth, and the guy doesn't have any in his mouth,
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.000]  and he goes, I'm going to choke you. And the guy's like laughing, he's like, what are you talking about?
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.000]  I don't have anything in my mouth. He goes, for your safety, I'm going to do this.
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.000]  And they choke him, and he passes out and falls in the hood, and they keep choking.
[12:18.000 --> 12:26.000]  And now the judge dismissed the case, and the cop's going to get fired.
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.000]  But the cop's saying, this is part of vascular restraint.
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.000]  Make sure you don't hurt yourself, and just the guy's a complete nutcase.
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.000]  But this is what they do when they break your arm for protesting. They say it's paying compliance,
[12:39.000 --> 12:45.000]  pressure compliance, torture's been institutionalized, choking's been institutionalized.
[12:45.000 --> 12:49.000]  They train you to jump on the vertebra, jump on the head, break the neck.
[12:49.000 --> 12:52.000]  Happens every few days, and it's just, oh, well, he died.
[12:52.000 --> 12:57.000]  You know, his neck was broken, or he was able to get blood to his brain.
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.000]  We were choking him, but that's not what killed him. And the tasers didn't kill him either.
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.000]  But you hear that clip, the illegal aliens in Austin, Texas, and everywhere else in this country,
[13:07.000 --> 13:12.000]  and I've talked to police, it's been on the news. They're told, let illegal aliens go if they're drunk.
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.000]  Don't pull them over. Don't take them to jail for no insurance. Don't take them to jail for no ID.
[13:16.000 --> 13:22.000]  It has nothing to do with keeping you safe and stopping drinking.
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  They're building more bars. They're building where I live.
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  Liquor stores the size of super wallmarts. They've got one in Kyle, south of Austin,
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.000]  the size of a super wallmart. It is the size of an aircraft carrier.
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.000]  And they've got satellite ones that are the size of regular grocery stores.
[13:42.000 --> 13:49.000]  I mean, big ones. Big, big. With bloodshot eye, white bunnies is the symbol for one of them.
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.000]  It's called specs. And, you know, the cops are constantly driving, drunk, smashing, and everybody.
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  That's been in the news. Off-duty cops do not go to jail for drinking and driving.
[13:59.000 --> 14:04.000]  It's called professional courtesy. You've got to ride it a million people in California
[14:04.000 --> 14:09.000]  who have special government plates, and they're allowed to drunk drive, run tolls.
[14:09.000 --> 14:16.000]  It's the same thing in China. In China, a bunch of cities got partially burned in the last couple weeks.
[14:16.000 --> 14:23.000]  Towns, police stations, government buildings. Because it's gotten so corrupt, the police are just raping women, beating people up.
[14:23.000 --> 14:29.000]  They work for local mobsters who rule. The local cops just take your property now, just take your house.
[14:29.000 --> 14:35.000]  No judge, no jury. And the people are fighting them and beating them with sticks and stones in China.
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.000]  I mean, China is just in revolt in the spirit of 1776.
[14:40.000 --> 14:47.000]  Just absolutely beautiful as they fight back against... See, that's called tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:47.000 --> 14:54.000]  In fact, I ought to go over that story. There's so many here in my stack, but they aren't real warrants.
[14:54.000 --> 14:59.000]  It's not enough for you. In the past, they would threaten you and take you in and have a nurse take your blood.
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.000]  That's not enough. Now, they're just going to do it with a fake warrant.
[15:03.000 --> 15:11.000]  Now, in other states, in some cities in Texas, they don't even have the fake warrant. They just say, we're doing it.
[15:11.000 --> 15:18.000]  Now, it wasn't enough that a bunch of states, including Texas passed laws that if you refuse the breathalyzer and exercise your fourth and fifth amendment,
[15:18.000 --> 15:29.000]  then you instantly lose your driver's license. But see, that's being defeated in court cases, so now they come in with a new criminal operation.
[15:29.000 --> 15:36.000]  And instead of police going out and you see a drunk swerving around, taking them to jail, it's, oh no, we better...
[15:36.000 --> 15:42.000]  Again, they're training you how to be slaves and the name of stopping drunk driving.
[15:42.000 --> 15:47.000]  When prescription drugs kill about five times a year what drunk driving does.
[15:47.000 --> 15:55.000]  But of course, our whole way of life is ending. We're going into a total police state and bankrupting the treasury in the name of fighting imaginary al-Qaeda groups.
[15:55.000 --> 16:01.000]  You have a better chance of being struck by lightning twice in one year than being killed by a terrorist, but it doesn't matter.
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.000]  They're now all over the news, white al-Qaeda, blonde haired, everyone's al-Qaeda, don't trust anyone.
[16:06.000 --> 16:12.000]  We got to have checkpoints on the streets and it's being believed.
[16:12.000 --> 16:21.000]  While Republican memos say they want to stage terror attacks and doesn't matter, the Democrats are about to come in with a reign of terror.
[16:21.000 --> 16:27.000]  Alright, let me go over the news for you. We told you this would happen all time oil.
[16:27.000 --> 16:32.000]  Oil hits new record above $145 a barrel.
[16:32.000 --> 16:40.000]  Oil soars to 146 of men. Concerns over hefty drop and U.S. stockpiles, Iran conflict. Total bull.
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.000]  AP will never tell you why.
[16:43.000 --> 16:51.000]  Bloomberg, the Financial Times of London, they all say, OPEC says, everybody knows it is dollar devaluation,
[16:51.000 --> 16:59.000]  but you cannot tell the cattle that because they might actually put political pressure on the Congress,
[16:59.000 --> 17:07.000]  the private fellow reserve, and the executive branch in both parties who are together on this devaluing the currency.
[17:07.000 --> 17:19.000]  The end of prosperity for decades, bare minimum, viciously assaulting all of us.
[17:19.000 --> 17:25.000]  Our public is so dumbed down they may not even know the dollar has been devalued when it is less than the peso.
[17:25.000 --> 17:28.000]  It is nearing parity with the peso.
[17:28.000 --> 17:33.000]  But again, you've already seen massive inflation internally. That's nothing compared to what it is externally.
[17:33.000 --> 17:40.000]  The dollar is toilet paper approaching toilet paper in many areas of the world.
[17:40.000 --> 17:45.000]  But you're not going to find out until it's too late.
[17:45.000 --> 17:51.000]  Early in the session, prices lifted to new highs by concerns of a larger than expected drop in U.S. oil stockpiles.
[17:51.000 --> 18:00.000]  The threat of violent conflict with Iran and comments by Saudi Arabian oil ministers suggesting this country would not boost production.
[18:00.000 --> 18:16.000]  Meanwhile, a group asked for divine intervention to ease oil prices as the price of oil continues to rise, some are turning to God and prayer for an answer to those financial troubles.
[18:16.000 --> 18:19.000]  Well, God helps those that help themselves.
[18:19.000 --> 18:25.000]  See, you have a criminal government that's destroying your currency. They debased it.
[18:25.000 --> 18:30.000]  They bought real assets offshore. Now they're leaving you holding the bag, but you'll never do that.
[18:30.000 --> 18:38.000]  You'll just pray and then, of course, support the war and rub your hand.
[18:38.000 --> 18:45.000]  You fools thought you were going to get, I remember all the neocons five years ago, oh, we're going to get lower oil prices.
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.000]  A lot of them say on talk radio, yeah, it's about oil, so what? We need it.
[18:49.000 --> 19:00.000]  Like the elite want to give you something like you're part of the elite. You thumbs suck and fake conservatives with jars of chicken neck cowards that act like you're Americans.
[19:00.000 --> 19:05.000]  You revel in ignorance and weakness and stupidity.
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  You think you're part of the establishment you buffoon.
[19:08.000 --> 19:12.000]  The globalists hate you more than they hate the Iraqis. They're exterminating right now.
[19:12.000 --> 19:15.000]  They hate this country. They're bringing it down everywhere they can.
[19:15.000 --> 19:20.000]  And you don't even know who the real enemy is, but you're going to find out you scumbags.
[19:20.000 --> 19:25.000]  The enemy is evil and I hate them, but I respect them. They know who they are. They know what they're doing.
[19:25.000 --> 19:31.000]  But you, you who think you're part of the system.
[19:31.000 --> 19:39.000]  The Pray at the Pump movement founded by Rocky Twyman, I'm going to get this guy on, has been holding prayer vigils at gas stations across the country on Monday.
[19:39.000 --> 19:45.000]  Twyman decided to take his movement from Exxon Shell stations straight to the steps of the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington.
[19:45.000 --> 19:53.000]  That isn't where it's happening, you little turd, excuse me. Saudi Arabia and the one doing it. It's your precious George Bush.
[19:53.000 --> 20:01.000]  May I have everyone's attention please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[20:01.000 --> 20:04.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[20:04.000 --> 20:11.000]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state? It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF.
[20:11.000 --> 20:20.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[20:20.000 --> 20:26.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[20:26.000 --> 20:30.000]  An inside job? How dare you?
[20:30.000 --> 20:36.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[20:36.000 --> 20:39.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[20:39.000 --> 20:45.000]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[20:45.000 --> 20:51.000]  Please rise, download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[20:51.000 --> 20:54.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[20:54.000 --> 21:00.000]  Hi, John Humner from Midas Resources. Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[21:00.000 --> 21:05.000]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week,
[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[21:08.000 --> 21:12.000]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.000]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  How much are you willing to lose?
[21:18.000 --> 21:24.000]  Take action now. Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[21:28.000 --> 21:31.000]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[21:31.000 --> 21:38.000]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[21:38.000 --> 21:44.000]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[21:46.000 --> 21:54.000]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[21:54.000 --> 22:00.000]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[22:00.000 --> 22:06.000]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans at the Center for Disease Control reports of suffering from internal parasites.
[22:06.000 --> 22:12.000]  If so, Freshwater Organics is proud to introduce you to a million-year-old miracle that has been used all over the world
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  by health-conscious individuals seeking alternatives to chemicals and drugs.
[22:16.000 --> 22:23.000]  FPP, or fossilized phytoplankton powder, is a 100% natural, organic product with absolutely no additives.
[22:23.000 --> 22:28.000]  When taken daily, it is an excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.
[22:28.000 --> 22:31.000]  Many believe it is a key to a healthy digestive tract.
[22:31.000 --> 22:42.000]  To find an FPP distributor near you, or to buy it now online, go to www.freshwaterorganics.com.
[22:42.000 --> 22:52.000]  You can also call toll-free at 888-949-3570. That's 888-949-3570.
[22:52.000 --> 22:56.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[22:56.000 --> 23:01.000]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[23:01.000 --> 23:06.000]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[23:06.000 --> 23:12.000]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, protect a complete fuel system treatment,
[23:12.000 --> 23:17.000]  cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[23:17.000 --> 23:22.000]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your engine.
[23:22.000 --> 23:26.000]  Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[23:26.000 --> 23:34.000]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95, and receive a free engine treatment, which is a $12.95 value-free.
[23:34.000 --> 23:53.000]  Call 888-949-3570. Use SFR-1. That number again is 888-949-3570. Use SFR-1, or check them out online at OilCompanySecret.com. That's OilCompanySecret.com. Satisfaction is guaranteed, or your money back, and it's safe for all cars. Act now.
[23:53.000 --> 24:05.000]  I shouldn't be so mean to these well-meaning fools. I'm just tired of seeing them raked by the establishment,
[24:05.000 --> 24:11.000]  led over cliffs, always being deceived, always stumbling in the wrong direction.
[24:11.000 --> 24:15.000]  All the globalists just laugh every time.
[24:15.000 --> 24:23.000]  Pray at the pump movement. Our people are really suffering through this crisis. I'm going to suffer a lot more, Mr. Twyman, as the dollar implodes.
[24:23.000 --> 24:33.000]  Twyman told Cybercast News, we need the Saudis to release at least 1.2 million barrels of oil per day for about the next six months until we can get everything settled in America.
[24:33.000 --> 24:38.000]  If they can't do that for us, then this will help us get through the crisis.
[24:38.000 --> 24:50.000]  No, it won't. If they release that much oil, you might see oil prices just stay at 4.20 per gallon on average at the pump.
[24:50.000 --> 25:00.000]  Some places are paying 5.50 for 87 octane. Do you understand? It is not scarcity.
[25:00.000 --> 25:11.000]  15% of the 100% increase we've seen last year, 100% before that, the vast majority is dollar evaluation.
[25:11.000 --> 25:23.000]  And we're in a race to try to explain this to the people. It's very simple, but we've never experienced a currency destruction, implosion in this nation,
[25:23.000 --> 25:31.000]  and so they just don't understand it. It's kind of like when sailors would land on an island that would have wild pigs on it that had never seen humans.
[25:31.000 --> 25:37.000]  The pigs would just walk right up to them and they could kill them. The same thing goes for dodo birds.
[25:37.000 --> 25:43.000]  That's why they got extinct there, and that particular island didn't have poor scenes on it, didn't have pigs,
[25:43.000 --> 25:49.000]  but it had dodo's and things in Galapagos, because they just walk right up to the sailors and they were big fat birds.
[25:49.000 --> 25:55.000]  They got to meet on them. Sailors killed all of them and ate them, because they didn't know, and that's what Americans are.
[25:55.000 --> 26:02.000]  We don't know. We're just like, don't know that black scheme asking people taking blood on street corners and cameras and firing troops
[26:02.000 --> 26:08.000]  and illegal aliens above the law and giant prisons being built everywhere. They don't know what that means.
[26:08.000 --> 26:15.000]  They're like dodo birds walking right up to a sailor who's just gotten off a ship who's starving to death. It's over.
[26:15.000 --> 26:20.000]  You're lunch on the table.
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.000]  It's just ridiculous. I've got all this other news. We've got some guests come up.
[26:23.000 --> 26:32.000]  Then when I start the next hour before Ron Paul joins us, I'll get more into all the big stack of news on what's happening with the economy.
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  I did want to briefly describe what my new film is all about.
[26:36.000 --> 26:45.000]  It's about showing people what the 9-11 Truth Movement is, aid, and showing people how you can get in politicians and world leaders
[26:45.000 --> 26:54.000]  and celebrities' faces and take over media events and have your voice heard in short circuit the controlled corporate prostitute media.
[26:54.000 --> 27:01.000]  It's about showing how the globalists, cold bloodedly, knew that the dust, the deadly mercury and concrete and asbestos
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.000]  was going to kill the police, military firemen and block you getting them treatment.
[27:06.000 --> 27:15.000]  The Mount Sinai documents and how over a thousand have died so far and now the 55,000 are very sick and it's going to be thousands and thousands dying.
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.000]  Every month now it's accelerating. It was like 500 a year ago.
[27:19.000 --> 27:27.000]  Now it's like 12, 300 last time I looked and then the problem is exploding.
[27:27.000 --> 27:33.000]  More importantly, it also gets into how there were bombs in the buildings.
[27:33.000 --> 27:42.000]  The film has information about the facts of 9-11 all throughout it and it shows the police state how they arrest bike riders in New York,
[27:42.000 --> 27:50.000]  how they beat them up, how the police run warrantless checkpoints all over, how you can't walk across the country without being harassed everywhere,
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.000]  how the police come up and threaten to set you up on video.
[27:54.000 --> 28:03.000]  I mean, this is a very important film and it's meant to energize and grow not just the 9-11 Truth Movement,
[28:03.000 --> 28:11.000]  but to get people out of their shells and active and it's to personalize who the 9-11 Truth Movement is and what we're doing to people
[28:11.000 --> 28:17.000]  because we're under attack. We're being demonized everywhere.
[28:17.000 --> 28:26.000]  Every cable news channel from MSNBC to CNBC to CNN to Fox is saying the military should be used against 9-11 Truthers.
[28:26.000 --> 28:34.000]  We should be shot. We should be killed. We should be taken to secret camps and tortured. We should be tasered. We should be beaten to pulp.
[28:34.000 --> 28:39.000]  They lie and say we're carrying out bombings. They say we're working with Al Qaeda.
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  This is all in the film. The media is saying that.
[28:43.000 --> 28:49.000]  Showing they're scared, showing the establishments worry, congressional hearings saying that we've got to be stopped
[28:49.000 --> 28:55.000]  because, you see, the establishment knows they carried out the attacks, knows that black-hop elements carried out 9-11.
[28:55.000 --> 29:00.000]  And people keep saying 9-11 was almost seven years ago. Why does it matter?
[29:00.000 --> 29:06.000]  It's the foundation of the whole police state takeover, the foundation of the wars that are bankrupting and destroying our name.
[29:06.000 --> 29:17.000]  The foundation of the new war we're about to see. It's the big lie. It's the master key that opened the gates of liberty and let tyranny in.
[29:17.000 --> 29:27.000]  If that myth, that fraud, that lie can be brought down, then they morally lose all their credibility and the enemy has been fully discredited.
[29:27.000 --> 29:32.000]  And we've already done that to a great extent, but we've got to continue. We're having massive success.
[29:32.000 --> 29:37.000]  And a lot of people sacrificed to do this and to all of you. In 9-11 Truth, I salute you.
[29:37.000 --> 29:43.000]  Truth Rising is your film. Use it to take this country and this world back.
[29:43.000 --> 29:51.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:51.000 --> 29:59.000]  Our beloved republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[29:59.000 --> 30:04.000]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope. The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[30:04.000 --> 30:10.000]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[30:10.000 --> 30:14.000]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[30:14.000 --> 30:20.000]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[30:54.000 --> 30:59.000]  Here I am at a gathering of friends, minding my own business. When one of our buddies Bob walks up to me,
[30:59.000 --> 31:03.000]  very concerned, he says, wow, have you seen the gasoline prices lately?
[31:03.000 --> 31:07.000]  I said, oh, of course. Whoo, they're high. He says, yeah, he says, what am I going to do?
[31:07.000 --> 31:10.000]  I've got a truck. There's no way anybody's going to buy my truck in this market.
[31:10.000 --> 31:14.000]  I really need the truck for my job. It uses more gas than I can afford.
[31:14.000 --> 31:18.000]  I've got to find a way to come up with some extra money. I've got a wife with four kids at home.
[31:18.000 --> 31:21.000]  I don't know what to do. I said, Bob, relax, I know what to do.
[31:21.000 --> 31:25.000]  Call efoodsdirect.com or go up on the web at efoodsdirect.com.

[31:39.000 --> 31:44.000]  and use it to buy more inexpensive food to hedge against tomorrow's increasing food prices.
[31:44.000 --> 31:47.000]  Why don't you do that, Bob? He said, efoodsdirect.com.
[31:47.000 --> 31:53.000]  I said, yep, call me at 1-800-409-5633. That's 800-409-5633. Do it now.
[31:53.000 --> 31:57.000]  Do you ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[31:57.000 --> 31:59.000]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[31:59.000 --> 32:05.000]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel, and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[32:05.000 --> 32:09.000]  Finalized the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston.
[32:09.000 --> 32:12.000]  Online from my desk with WebEx.
[32:12.000 --> 32:15.000]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[32:15.000 --> 32:20.000]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop
[32:20.000 --> 32:46.000]  so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[33:05.000 --> 33:10.000]  Is it getting better?
[33:10.000 --> 33:15.000]  Or do you feel the same?
[33:15.000 --> 33:20.000]  Will it make it easier on your mouth?
[33:20.000 --> 33:24.000]  You've got someone to blame
[33:24.000 --> 33:30.000]  You said one love, one life
[33:30.000 --> 33:35.000]  When it's one need in the night
[33:35.000 --> 33:40.000]  One love, we get to share it
[33:40.000 --> 33:47.000]  It leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it
[33:47.000 --> 33:50.000]  Here's some of the news.
[33:50.000 --> 33:54.000]  Oil hits $146 a barrel.
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.000]  Worried oil chiefs fail to find consensus.
[33:58.000 --> 34:05.000]  AFP, if you go read what the world oil chiefs in OPEC actually say, they're worried about the dollar implosion crisis.
[34:05.000 --> 34:10.000]  That's what they say in all their press releases, but you're not allowed to know that here in the United States
[34:10.000 --> 34:14.000]  because this is the land of deception and fraud.
[34:14.000 --> 34:18.000]  LA, Miami home foreclosure rates more than double.
[34:18.000 --> 34:23.000]  New foreclosures almost quadrupled in Los Angeles and double in Miami in the second quarter
[34:23.000 --> 34:30.000]  as as much as $5 billion worth of loans going bad in LA alone and online real estate data company.
[34:30.000 --> 34:35.000]  The number of homes scheduled for auction in Los Angeles rose $14,505
[34:35.000 --> 34:39.000]  compared to just $3,797 the same period of a year earlier.
[34:39.000 --> 34:53.000]  Property shrink chart said in a report distributed by email in Miami-Dade County the number climbed to $2,677 from $1,282.
[34:53.000 --> 35:00.000]  The foreclosure chart for Los Angeles is unfortunately starting to look like a ski jump,
[35:00.000 --> 35:06.000]  a member of property sharks foreclosure products team said in a statement.
[35:06.000 --> 35:12.000]  Continuing here, this is out of Los Angeles Times.
[35:12.000 --> 35:18.000]  It goes on to report that their entire neighborhoods that are completely empty as people now,
[35:18.000 --> 35:26.000]  as the tent cities are expanding from Michigan to California to Florida to New York State.
[35:26.000 --> 35:31.000]  And meanwhile, Secretary of the Treasury Paulson says everything's great.
[35:31.000 --> 35:34.000]  The economy is going to start booming now.
[35:34.000 --> 35:39.000]  Meanwhile, Starbucks to close 600 stores, hundreds of major change,
[35:39.000 --> 35:45.000]  either closing branches or completely shutting down, manufacturing leaving,
[35:45.000 --> 35:52.000]  open discussions of General Motors imploding.
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.000]  Meanwhile, all over the country, the police are announcing under federalization.
[35:56.000 --> 35:59.000]  They're going to be taking blood without warrants at checkpoints.
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.000]  UK report predicts brain implants and mass revolution.
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  American Free Press did that report.
[36:05.000 --> 36:06.000]  The debate is over.
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  Waterboarding is torture article by Paul Watson.
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  China inspired interrogations at Gitmo.
[36:10.000 --> 36:14.000]  They use communist Chinese torture manuals to carry out the torture.
[36:14.000 --> 36:21.000]  Meanwhile, there's disgusting Fox News reports about how wonderful it is to live at Gitmo
[36:21.000 --> 36:26.000]  where you live outdoors in cages 24 hours a day being bitten by mosquitoes.
[36:26.000 --> 36:29.000]  And then they chain you down and wheel you to the bathroom.
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  That's what's at the camp.
[36:31.000 --> 36:37.000]  But they got Fox News reports claiming that it is some type of health club.
[36:37.000 --> 36:38.000]  I'm not joking.
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.000]  By the way, Fox News just got caught yesterday taking two New York Times riders
[36:42.000 --> 36:45.000]  and putting bags under their eyes, stretching their faces,
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  doubling the size of their noses,
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.000]  and putting it in a newscast like it was real.
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.000]  I mean, that's how dumb they think their viewers are, folks.
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  That's an insult to you.
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.000]  That's the type of deception that's going on by the mainstream media.
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[37:01.000 --> 37:05.000]  We do have our guest joining us from Geneva, Switzerland.
[37:05.000 --> 37:11.000]  Codex Alimentarius is now taking place.
[37:11.000 --> 37:16.000]  And we are joined by Major General Albert Stubblebein,
[37:16.000 --> 37:19.000]  former head of Army Intelligence, former head of Special Forces,
[37:19.000 --> 37:22.000]  former heads of just all sorts of really amazing programs,
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  and his wife, Dr. Rima Lebo.
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  So we're really excited about that.
[37:28.000 --> 37:29.000]  They are there.
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  Last time they went to Codex, they were escorted out,
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  even though they had passes at gunpoint.
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  And that was in Rome.
[37:35.000 --> 37:36.000]  They are there right now.
[37:36.000 --> 37:39.000]  We're very honored to have them reporting for us.
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  And again, we have...
[37:41.000 --> 37:42.000]  Who should I go to first?
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  I know there's Major General Stubblebein and Dr. Lebo.
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  Again, welcome both of you.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  Well, thank you so much.
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.000]  I'm probably more the introvert or the extrovert,
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  so I'll start because I can't resist,
[37:55.000 --> 37:59.000]  but General Stubblebein is here, too.
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.000]  This time, we were not met by armed guards the way we were in Rome,
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  because we didn't pre-register,
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  so they didn't have the guards standing there.
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  We've learned that much.
[38:10.000 --> 38:18.000]  This time, we were forced to attend the Codex meeting
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  from a totally empty balcony,
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.000]  which, by the way, didn't have much air conditioning,
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.000]  and it is summer here in Europe, too, just like the United States,
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.000]  where there were no desks to work on.
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  There were no plugs readily available
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.000]  for plugging electrical supplies for the computers.
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  So they put you in the doghouse.
[38:40.000 --> 38:43.000]  They put us in the peanut gallery, as a matter of fact.
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  The doghouse would have been an improvement,
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.000]  but nonetheless, there we were,
[38:48.000 --> 38:55.000]  and we had a chance to observe what one person recently called
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  a kangaroo court for food.
[38:58.000 --> 39:03.000]  Food is being weaponized by the multinational depopulationists
[39:03.000 --> 39:09.000]  and Codex is a prime tool of that weaponization.
[39:09.000 --> 39:13.000]  So they've wrapped themselves in a cloak of legitimacy,
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.000]  as if everything they do makes sense
[39:16.000 --> 39:23.000]  and has some sort of international authorization and authority,
[39:23.000 --> 39:28.000]  just exactly the way the police state is being cloaked in legitimacy
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.000]  with bogus bills and memoranda
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.000]  and executive orders, which are totally illegitimate,
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.000]  but the pretense is that they're legitimate actions.
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.000]  Before Congress, John Yoo and Addington,
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  the two White House lawyers, would not say
[39:46.000 --> 39:49.000]  that the President couldn't order the torture of children
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  or burial alive just last week.
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  Just amazing.
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.000]  Yes, and it's the same level of lack of decency,
[39:59.000 --> 40:06.000]  the lack of principle that's leading to the food adulteration
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  as if it made some sort of sense,
[40:09.000 --> 40:16.000]  but I'm happy to tell you, as corrupt and as crumblingly evil as Codex is,
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.000]  and I do believe that it's evil at its root,
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.000]  although the mid-level bureaucrats who attended
[40:22.000 --> 40:27.000]  and carry out its standards and guidelines in their home countries
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  haven't got a clue.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  Yeah, they've got the false paradigm download.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  They're given that false mission statement
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  and they're told they're doing these things for different reasons,
[40:35.000 --> 40:38.000]  and then they actually read the core originating documents.
[40:38.000 --> 40:41.000]  It says the UN said at the Big World Population Summit
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  in the late 90s in China,
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  the head of the UN Food Program said,
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  we are using food as a weapon and we are weaponizing it.
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  We're talking to medical doctor Reema Lebo,
[40:52.000 --> 40:55.000]  and of course her husband, Major General Albert Stubblebine,
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  knows that don't know. You're so close to this problem,
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  one of the world leading experts on Codex,
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  and so is General Stubblebine,
[41:01.000 --> 41:06.000]  in a nutshell, tell us what the overarching tentacles of Codex is doing,
[41:06.000 --> 41:12.000]  what it's up to, and basically why you're there trying to stop it.
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  Break it down for people and then get into that weaponization of food,
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  and then I want to get General Stubblebine's take on what you're witnessing.
[41:18.000 --> 41:21.000]  Sure. Let me go backwards.
[41:21.000 --> 41:25.000]  Why we're here is because General Stubblebine and I closed our
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  private medical practice in 2004,
[41:28.000 --> 41:31.000]  because we saw this great evil stalking the earth,
[41:31.000 --> 41:37.000]  weaponizing food, and poisoning the world's food supply,
[41:37.000 --> 41:42.000]  quite literally, to allow the pharmaceutical and death industry,
[41:42.000 --> 41:47.000]  the illness care industry, which goes by the name of the healthcare industry,
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  but of course it's no such thing.
[41:49.000 --> 41:55.000]  We saw it gathering in the abundance that people produce
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.000]  when they're sick inside the illness care industry,
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.000]  but using food as a principal tool to make them sick,
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.000]  keep them that way, and then of course have them die.
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.000]  And we said we can't be silent, and watch this,
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.000]  and just protect ourselves, fill a freezer full of supplements,
[42:13.000 --> 42:16.000]  and grow our own organic food,
[42:16.000 --> 42:21.000]  because that would make us perpetrators by our very silence.
[42:21.000 --> 42:23.000]  So we closed our practice, and that, by the way,
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.000]  is an ethical position that I hold very dear.
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  If you know that evil is being perpetrated,
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.000]  and you do nothing, you become a perpetrator.
[42:31.000 --> 42:36.000]  So we closed our practice, and we created the Natural Solutions Foundation,
[42:36.000 --> 42:42.000]  which is an independent 501c3 not-for-profit organization
[42:42.000 --> 42:48.000]  which has no government, or corporate, or other major interest sponsorship,
[42:48.000 --> 42:54.000]  and its website is www.healthfreedomusa.org.
[42:54.000 --> 42:57.000]  Healthfreedomusa.org.
[42:57.000 --> 43:01.000]  And we said we have to study this health freedom issue carefully,
[43:01.000 --> 43:06.000]  and we have to attack the things that are attacking our health freedom
[43:06.000 --> 43:07.000]  wherever we find them.
[43:07.000 --> 43:10.000]  And the first place that we found them was Codex.
[43:10.000 --> 43:15.000]  We realized, and I had been studying Codex for about a decade before that,
[43:15.000 --> 43:18.000]  we realized that Codex had a solution,
[43:18.000 --> 43:21.000]  and that that solution was a legal one.
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.000]  So we asked a couple of very, very fine lawyers,
[43:25.000 --> 43:30.000]  one of whom is our trustee for the foundation, Ralph Cusatola,
[43:30.000 --> 43:37.000]  and another of whom is a long-term freedom advocate, Jim Turner, in Washington, D.C.
[43:37.000 --> 43:43.000]  We asked them if they wouldn't study Codex and the World Trade Organization
[43:43.000 --> 43:48.000]  and its agreements and other relevant laws and documents,
[43:48.000 --> 43:51.000]  and come up with a solution, and they did that pro bono.
[43:51.000 --> 43:53.000]  Thousands of hours pro bono.
[43:53.000 --> 43:54.000]  Exactly.
[43:54.000 --> 43:57.000]  I want to be clear, Dr. Leibow and General Stoban,
[43:57.000 --> 44:01.000]  I want to give you guys credit because I've been studying Codex for more than a decade
[44:01.000 --> 44:02.000]  and having a lot of experts on,
[44:02.000 --> 44:06.000]  and just in the last few years you guys have effectively exposed them like no one else,
[44:06.000 --> 44:09.000]  and effectively showed people alternatives,
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.000]  and have been effectively really damaging their credibility,
[44:13.000 --> 44:16.000]  and so we all owe you a debt of gratitude, and so...
[44:16.000 --> 44:17.000]  Well, thank you.
[44:17.000 --> 44:18.000]  Thank you very much.
[44:18.000 --> 44:21.000]  We've been trying, and they certainly know it.
[44:21.000 --> 44:24.000]  I mean, we are not their favorite people.
[44:24.000 --> 44:26.000]  That's the understatement of the year.
[44:26.000 --> 44:31.000]  When we get attacked by Codex publicly and dramatically,
[44:31.000 --> 44:36.000]  I always take it with a note of appreciation and say thank you
[44:36.000 --> 44:40.000]  because they confirm that we're on target
[44:40.000 --> 44:43.000]  and that our strategies are tremendously effective.
[44:43.000 --> 44:47.000]  General, what's that old saying about you're over the target?
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  You're going to be getting the flack.
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  I mean, that's how you know when you're over the target.
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  That's exactly right.
[44:52.000 --> 44:57.000]  But I must say the armed guards were quite startling.
[44:57.000 --> 45:04.000]  We realized that countries do not have to adopt the Codex standards.
[45:04.000 --> 45:07.000]  Now let me back up and explain what Codex is.
[45:07.000 --> 45:13.000]  Very briefly, Codex is a UN commission that is run by its parent bodies
[45:13.000 --> 45:17.000]  at the request of the UN, those parent bodies of the World Health Organization,
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  and despite its lovely name,
[45:19.000 --> 45:23.000]  the World Health Organization is one of those international organizations
[45:23.000 --> 45:28.000]  which has declared that the only way to make the world sustainable
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.000]  is to kill 80-90% of its population.
[45:32.000 --> 45:37.000]  And that's official United Nations biological diversity assessments,
[45:37.000 --> 45:40.000]  policy at all the major university biology divisions.
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  I've made a film called Endgame on it.
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  I want everybody listening when you understand.
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  The doctor is not joking. Go ahead.
[45:46.000 --> 45:48.000]  No, I'm not joking.
[45:48.000 --> 45:51.000]  Today somebody said to me, I was doing another radio interview today,
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  and somebody said to me, well,
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  but don't you think that people will just think
[45:56.000 --> 45:59.000]  that you're involved in a conspiracy theory?
[45:59.000 --> 46:02.000]  And I said, not if they study the facts.
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  It's very simple.
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  We know it, you know it, I know it,
[46:06.000 --> 46:09.000]  and those of us who are alert know it.
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  It's very important that we know it
[46:11.000 --> 46:14.000]  because the more of us that know these facts,
[46:14.000 --> 46:17.000]  the more of us that have read the Millennium 2000 document,
[46:17.000 --> 46:23.000]  the more of us that understand that Kissinger's memorandum 200,
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.000]  in which he said that the first priority of American foreign policy
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  must be depopulation starting with the Third World.
[46:30.000 --> 46:33.000]  I mean, these people are so blatant.
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  They think that we are so uninformed and so powerless
[46:36.000 --> 46:40.000]  that they tell us exactly what they have in mind,
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.000]  and then they go ahead and do exactly what they said they were going to do.
[46:43.000 --> 46:46.000]  Well, I think that's the hiding and plain sight
[46:46.000 --> 46:49.000]  to get their own minions on board.
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.000]  They have to say this is legal and good and open,
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  and then hope the public doesn't notice.
[46:54.000 --> 46:57.000]  That's kind of why they come out and say torture's okay and can be done
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  so that their own officers will go,
[46:59.000 --> 47:01.000]  well, they're talking about it on TV.
[47:01.000 --> 47:02.000]  It must be okay.
[47:02.000 --> 47:03.000]  It must be okay.
[47:03.000 --> 47:04.000]  Exactly.
[47:04.000 --> 47:09.000]  But I'm always stunned by the fact that folks like this
[47:09.000 --> 47:11.000]  make it clear what they're intending.
[47:11.000 --> 47:15.000]  Khomeini said for 20 years when he was in exile in Paris,
[47:15.000 --> 47:17.000]  here's what I'm going to do, and then he did it.
[47:17.000 --> 47:20.000]  And as I always like to point out to General Stubblebind,
[47:20.000 --> 47:25.000]  the United States intelligence system missed it totally.
[47:25.000 --> 47:27.000]  However, that's not the point.
[47:27.000 --> 47:29.000]  The point is that Khomeini said,
[47:29.000 --> 47:31.000]  I'm going to take over Iran, and here's how I'm going to do it.
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.000]  Well, Hitler said what he was going to do.
[47:33.000 --> 47:34.000]  Didn't he, General Stubblebind?
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  Exactly.
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  Did you hear that?
[47:38.000 --> 47:39.000]  I don't think he heard it.
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  Well, we're going to bring him in after the break.
[47:41.000 --> 47:42.000]  I just want to give you both equal time.
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  I mean, I know he wants you to continue.
[47:44.000 --> 47:47.000]  It's this takeover that you're trying to make from.
[47:47.000 --> 47:52.000]  Codex was founded, and this story is on our website,
[47:52.000 --> 47:57.000]  healthfreedomusa.org, as a video.
[47:57.000 --> 48:02.000]  And that's the Neutricide video, which you can click on and watch.
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.000]  Codex was founded when the former head of IG Farben,
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.000]  sitting in jail for crimes against humanity
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  after the Nuremberg War Tribunal, said,
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.000]  hey, we didn't have to use all those personnel
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.000]  and worry about the Cyclone B production,
[48:18.000 --> 48:19.000]  and so on.
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  We could have just controlled the world through food.
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  So he got out of jail, went back to work,
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  became the head of Bayer Pharmaceuticals,
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.000]  Bayer, we say, pharmaceuticals, again,
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  and called a bunch of his former underlings,
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  who were also pharmaceutical executives
[48:32.000 --> 48:35.000]  and had been in jail with him, together,
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  and said, let's suggest to the UN
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  that it take over the world trade of food.
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  The UN was only too happy to do that.
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.000]  Now, a medical doctor, for everybody listening,
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  what she's saying is a historical fact.
[48:47.000 --> 48:48.000]  They documented all on their website.
[48:48.000 --> 48:49.000]  I've independently researched it.
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  What they're saying is accurate.
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  People will say, well, Bayer's not doing that now.
[48:53.000 --> 48:57.000]  In every case, with Factor 8, for more than a decade,
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  millions of people got HIV and hepatitis.
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.000]  They knew every ampule of the Factor 8 blood drug
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  had it in there, and their own documents came out.
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  I had the lawyer that won the suit against them,
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  Pat Antonio on, was on MSNBC as well,
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.000]  and they got their own documents where they knowingly said,
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  this will kill everyone that takes it, ship it out.
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  But it wasn't just that they didn't care.
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  They thought it was good.
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  Just like Hilder killed the hemophiliacs.
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  Go ahead.
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  I cannot be aware in the United States
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  that the birthday of Fritz Termir,
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  the head of a biopharmaceutical
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  and the architect of Codex,
[49:36.000 --> 49:40.000]  the birthday of Fritz Termir, the convicted board criminal,
[49:40.000 --> 49:44.000]  the man who sold people for pharmaceutical experiments
[49:44.000 --> 49:49.000]  during World War II and enslaved labor inmates,
[49:49.000 --> 49:54.000]  and arranged for the killing program of children
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  before World War II.
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  Fritz Termir is a man whose birthday is celebrated
[49:59.000 --> 50:02.000]  as a holiday in Germany.
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  Think about that.
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.000]  He said, being a creative sort of fellow,
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  why don't we have the UN take over the world trade of food?
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.000]  Now, I keep pointing out to people
[50:14.000 --> 50:18.000]  that when the pharmaceutical industry becomes interested in food,
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  we have a big problem,
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.000]  because if healthy people who are eating healthy food
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  don't become patients,
[50:26.000 --> 50:29.000]  the pharmaceutical industry suffers financially.
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  They don't like that.
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  You're there, doctor.
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.000]  You're quick through what they're trying to ram through right now
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  on the agenda and how we shoot them down.
[50:38.000 --> 50:41.000]  You really sum that up, who they are, what their agenda is.
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.000]  GMO food, pharmacological food,
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.000]  forcing vaccines, brain-altering live virus vaccines
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.000]  into the food to, quote, make us well mentally.
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  I'm not kidding.
[50:54.000 --> 51:00.000]  Another untold story here it comes.
[51:00.000 --> 51:04.000]  Another untold story here it comes.
[51:04.000 --> 51:08.000]  Another untold story that you have not been told
[51:08.000 --> 51:14.000]  from another untoldstory.com.
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.000]  There is an untold story behind the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  The story told and told for years
[51:19.000 --> 51:22.000]  is that it was a surprise, a surprise attack.
[51:22.000 --> 51:25.000]  But there are facts in that story that have gone untold
[51:25.000 --> 51:30.000]  that when told makes one think coincidence or conspiracy,
[51:30.000 --> 51:34.000]  such as all those defending fighter airplanes parked out in the open
[51:34.000 --> 51:38.000]  in the middle of the field so one or two bombs could take them all out,
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  such as, but a few days before,
[51:40.000 --> 51:44.000]  the anti-aircraft artillery ammunition was put away and locked up.
[51:44.000 --> 51:48.000]  Was it a coincidence or perfect timing that the government did something
[51:48.000 --> 51:52.000]  that assured the Marine and Army bases would be pretty well empty
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  of men the day of the attack
[51:54.000 --> 51:57.000]  and the day before the attack the Pacific fleet of ships
[51:57.000 --> 52:00.000]  brought into the harbor and tied up like sitting ducks
[52:00.000 --> 52:03.000]  and how did the Japanese not only know they would be there
[52:03.000 --> 52:06.000]  but the name of the ships that would be there and where
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  when they were still coming in,
[52:08.000 --> 52:13.000]  being tied in Saturday evening prior to the early Sunday morning attack.
[52:13.000 --> 52:17.000]  Here one of the Marines that was there tell all this and more,
[52:17.000 --> 52:22.000]  he was one of the Marines with a rifle that shot down a Japanese zero that day.
[52:22.000 --> 52:25.000]  Guess what they found on the Japanese pilot?
[52:25.000 --> 52:29.000]  That changes the story facts from coincidence to conspiracy,
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  treachery and treason.
[52:31.000 --> 52:58.000]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.000]  I went to grounds here and we knew what to do,
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  or at least we thought we did.
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[53:06.000 --> 53:10.000]  that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[53:10.000 --> 53:16.000]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement
[53:16.000 --> 53:19.000]  that the air was safe to breathe.
[53:19.000 --> 53:22.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth
[53:22.000 --> 53:26.000]  as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[53:26.000 --> 53:29.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[53:29.000 --> 53:35.000]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[53:38.000 --> 53:44.000]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.000]  or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror,
[53:49.000 --> 53:53.000]  they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[53:53.000 --> 54:06.000]  Well, we're going north to Geneva, Switzerland,
[54:06.000 --> 54:10.000]  where private banking interests have their United Nations
[54:10.000 --> 54:14.000]  with the military enforcement of NATO, the UN, and the United States,
[54:14.000 --> 54:19.000]  and they are taking over world food production, world food standards, controls.
[54:19.000 --> 54:23.000]  They're the people that get worldwide certification of basting all the meat
[54:23.000 --> 54:28.000]  and live viruses grown in huge vats with other viruses
[54:28.000 --> 54:31.000]  that have been connected to all sorts of cancers and problems.
[54:31.000 --> 54:36.000]  And for four years, we are eating that here in the United States.
[54:36.000 --> 54:39.000]  They soak our meat in live viruses.
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  If you think I'm joking, folks, just Google it.
[54:41.000 --> 54:42.000]  It's mainstream news.
[54:42.000 --> 54:43.000]  They'll tell you how great it is.
[54:43.000 --> 54:50.000]  This is what the general is talking about, Dr. Rima Labo
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  and Major General Albert Stubblebine.
[54:52.000 --> 54:53.000]  She is an MD.
[54:53.000 --> 54:56.000]  And they'll be with us for another 30 minutes up until Ron Paul.
[54:56.000 --> 55:01.000]  And she was just telling me during the break that it was their plan
[55:01.000 --> 55:06.000]  that they put together that Ron Paul has adopted as his Health Freedom Initiative.
[55:06.000 --> 55:09.000]  Tell us briefly about that, because I want to hear about the positive things
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  you and others are doing.
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  And I knew that behind the scenes.
[55:13.000 --> 55:14.000]  And of course, you told me about that.
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  We may be letting a secret out of the bag.
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  But the point is, you guys are really effective.
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  Thank you.
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.000]  Ron Paul was speaking truth to power and to the people.
[55:24.000 --> 55:27.000]  And we think that that is incredibly important.
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.000]  Now, as a 501c3, we can endorse a candidate, but we can educate.
[55:31.000 --> 55:36.000]  And one of the things that we've been doing is supporting all of his Health Freedom bills,
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  like 2117 and others.
[55:38.000 --> 55:44.000]  So we ask people to sign up for our Health Freedom Alerts and become mouse warriors.
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.000]  The voice of the people is strikingly significant.
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  That's what we're putting into practice.
[55:50.000 --> 55:56.000]  That's what the people who forced New York State back off compulsory vaccines are proving.
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  And we're forcing the hormones out of the milk.
[55:59.000 --> 56:00.000]  Exactly.
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  That's what's frustrating to me, doctor.
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  And I want General Stubblebine to pop in now and then we'll get more into solutions.
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  We've got more time with you.
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  And one of the things that we've been doing is that when the people take action we have power,
[56:10.000 --> 56:13.000]  the frustrating thing is they don't think they have power and won't get moving.
[56:13.000 --> 56:19.000]  I mean, can you rally the troops general and explain to them the power of the individual taking action with info?
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  Well, I think so.
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  The answer to that is absolutely.
[56:23.000 --> 56:29.000]  One of our purpose of the foundation is literally to protect all of our freedoms.
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  That includes our Health Freedom.
[56:31.000 --> 56:36.000]  In Codex, it's about degrading our food quality, degrading the food.
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  Degraded food means a degraded health.
[56:38.000 --> 56:42.000]  Degraded health means that you've got to have vitamins and minerals.
[56:42.000 --> 56:48.000]  But the Codex, excuse me, has degraded the vitamins and minerals.
[56:48.000 --> 56:53.000]  As a result of that, you cannot protect your health.
[56:53.000 --> 56:56.000]  And so you take drugs and then you die.
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  We don't think that that's the right way to go.
[56:59.000 --> 57:06.000]  That's one of the reasons, only one, but that's one of the reasons why we've been so vigorous.
[57:06.000 --> 57:13.000]  And so challenging in our meetings with Codex.
[57:13.000 --> 57:22.000]  We do not believe that they have the right of degrading the food so that you cannot be healthy.
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  I think that's terrible.
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  Tell them about the pig meat.
[57:26.000 --> 57:35.000]  There was a meeting in the United States recently regarding veterinary drugs and usage.
[57:35.000 --> 57:39.000]  And one of the countries that wanted to come very badly was China.
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  This is a Codex meeting.
[57:41.000 --> 57:46.000]  Yeah, this is a Codex meeting in the United States, chaired by the United States.
[57:46.000 --> 57:55.000]  And the United States would not allow China to have visas so they couldn't come to the meeting.
[57:55.000 --> 58:02.000]  Well, what China said just yesterday was that we tried to get to the meeting.
[58:02.000 --> 58:13.000]  We couldn't get our visas, but we do not believe that you should authorize the beta agonist into the pig meat.
[58:13.000 --> 58:21.000]  China is the largest creator, the largest producer of pigs.
[58:21.000 --> 58:25.000]  And in general, stay there. We've got to come back in 60 seconds.
[58:25.000 --> 58:35.000]  We're going to come back on the other side and tell us what they're wanting to put in the pig meat and what our government is trying to keep secret.
[58:35.000 --> 58:44.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:44.000 --> 58:59.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[58:59.000 --> 59:02.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[59:02.000 --> 59:12.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:12.000 --> 59:18.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:18.000 --> 59:22.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[59:22.000 --> 59:25.000]  The old America is making great progress toward the world government.
[59:25.000 --> 59:29.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[59:29.000 --> 59:30.000]  Yes, they're after easy.

[59:39.000 --> 59:46.000]  Blueprint for global enslaved. You have been warned.
[59:46.000 --> 59:58.000]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  We're talking to Major General Stubblebine and his wife, Dr. Rima Lebo, MD.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  They're the Codex Alimentarius global government food takeover meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  I was getting into China, the biggest pork producer, doesn't want to put a particular agent into the meat.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  But I guess the U.S. does and Codex does. Please continue, General.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  Well, the answer is you're exactly right. The U.S. is pushing to allow the use of these beta agonists.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  And of course, what they do is they create heart problems, lung problems, stroke problems, you know?
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  So they are not very good for your health. China says don't do that.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  But China was not allowed to have visas to get into the country to be at the meeting to complain.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  So at the meeting just yesterday, China said, but we couldn't get our visas,
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  but we do not believe that you should put that in. And the result of that, oh, and they were backed up by the U,
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  who said we are the second producer of all of this, and we don't believe they should go in.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  The result was, however, that the chairman said, well, you weren't there, you couldn't present your case,
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  and we're going to do it.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  But we're going to talk about it for another year, and then we're going to do it.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  So it was a kangaroo court for this poison.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  It was worse than a kangaroo court, because it wasn't even nice.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  So rubber stamp. Now, doctor, you're a medical doctor. What do these chemicals do?
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  These particular chemicals not only fatten the hogs so they come to market heavier,
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  which means they're worth more to the producers, but they also cause, when they're ingested by human beings,
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  heart problems, they cause stroke, they cause blood pressure to fall rapidly,
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  they cause breathing difficulties and can cause death.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  And their metabolites, the things that they're turned into by the body of the pig, are even more toxic.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  So of course they should be banned, but the United States never met a chemical additive that it didn't like.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  Now, let's be clear. Cancer is exploding, everything's exploding.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  You've got women who are 5'5", the husband's 5'9", but their daughters are over 6'2".
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Obviously the growth hormone.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  Hundreds of thousands of British, millions of US children are going into puberty below 8",
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  tens of thousands at age 3.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  Instead of saying, get off the GMO, get off the hormones, this is in the news,
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  they then shoot them up with other toxic hormones to suppress that.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  What is all, again, I mean, this is the black-off, this is the extermination.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  You know, I tell this story and it's very instructive.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  Within minutes of my writing a blast, an e-blast to my list,
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  saying perhaps it's no accident that pharmaceuticals are the major killer in the United States.
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  More people die from pharmaceuticals properly used than from cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes,
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  and obesity, the five major killers.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  Within minutes of my writing that, my website was hit by a DDOS,
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  a distributed denial of service attack.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  When my webmaster put up a page saying we're having technical difficulties, please come back later.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  His two servers, totally unconnected with ours, were also hit by DDOSes
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  and every site on his servers.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  When he took down the page, his sites came back up within minutes.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  So this is, I found that a very, very instructive and confirmatory moment.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  There's no question that this is being a pharmaceutical in our food and in our bodies
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  are being used to harm us and control us by the way.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  That's an underlying, an underlining, that's a exclamation point.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  When they open up on you in the Info War, open up on you with fire, you know it's real.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  And I've had all the same stuff happen to folks.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  I don't mean we have a server problem and blaming on them.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  No, I mean real attacks where they come in with codes, get into servers, turn our servers off.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  Denial of service attacks coming from Pentagon computers.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  We can track it right back to where it is.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  Dr. Labo, General Stubblebind, stay there.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  Talk more about what's happening currently at the meeting, what we can do, your website,
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  how folks can get involved on the other side of this quick break.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  Long segment coming up, stay with us.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  Finalized the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston.
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  Online from my desk with WebEx.
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  Travel less, meet online.

[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  Question, is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:01.000]  A world economic collapse could come any day.
[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  Question, are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  Question, do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?

[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  Go to survivalistseeds.com.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  Do it now or become property of the New World Order.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  I've come with a message of information.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  9-11 was an inside job.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  An inside job.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  How dare you?
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  Truth Rising.

[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  Truth Rising is scheduled to come out at midnight central standard time this evening.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  A little hint to our loyal listeners and the prisonplanet.tv members.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  It's going to be out this evening early.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  You can watch it tonight.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  It'll be blasted all over the web tomorrow.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  But see it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  DIVX versions to burn right to DVD.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  Play on most DVD players.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  As you can spread the word immediately.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  Explosive growth of this info.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  Expose that the New World Order crime syndicate carried out the attacks.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  That's their big excuse for their police state to force codecs and everything else down our throats.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  And I wanted to bring this up to you doctor because you're a medical doctor and have looked into their operations.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  I remember about nine years ago I learned about the new class of vaccines.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  I read UN documents, big university reports.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  They were very proud of it.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  They were saying they were going to genetically engineer the crops to have, to grow the vaccine themselves.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  But the vaccine is a live virus.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  And they said things like, oh, so Asians don't use opium.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  It will go in and create plaques in the neurons where they can't absorb the opium.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  They had a footnote, but we've shown in studies with rats and guinea pigs that they then aren't as happy because the opium simulates natural endorphins.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  So they're literally destroying the receptors.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  And then they said, oh, we can also force in England a shot of a virus that attacks your brain and blocks you being able to ever have nicotine or quote being obese wanting to eat.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  And then I read the government documents about literally having an attack the centers of our brain, which will make us aggressive.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  Oh, we could give people shots who are murderers, but then you really read it to attack aggression centers.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  We're talking about viral lobotomies.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  And now there come, you know, the HPV shot is a live cancer virus has killed a bunch of people.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  The Gardasil, can you speak to that and how codex ties into that?
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  Oh, I certainly can.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  One of the things that I love about being on your show, Alex, is you keep giving me opportunities to talk about the things that I'm most head up about.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  And these are some of them.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  Codex just accepted all genetically modified plants as safe.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  Doesn't matter what the genetic modification is, now they're safe.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  And when Sudan objected to this and when Iran objected to this, the chairman literally started screaming at first Sudan and then Iran and closed discussion.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  He said, we've already accepted animals as safe that are genetically modified.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  What's the difference? Plants are safe.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  But the report on biotechnology, which was formally adopted at this meeting of Codex, says in its annex number three, and it's a very interesting annex, which I'm going to publish on our website,
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  it says that plants modified to produce increased amounts of nutrients are either so dangerous that we don't know their effects on human beings,
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  and it can't be studied in a laboratory.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  It must be studied on large populations of human beings.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  That's interesting.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  Or they produce nutrients which are not effective, or they produce nutrients which are themselves toxic, or they produce nutrients which compete with the real nutrients, and we don't know.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  But we've accepted them.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  We as Codex have accepted them.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  Let's be clear, at least with a new drug, they've got a claim they've gotten approval.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  They're just saying anything goes, jellyfish genes and monkeys, human genes and pigs already on the table, you know, insect genes and cows already on the table,
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  cloned milk already, radiating everything, bathing it in, quote, bacteria-eating viruses.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  That's what the Latin translates to for listeners.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  And then all the top scientists admit this is the stuff that could cause a soylent green chain reaction and really hurt the earth.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  Instead, they want to regulate carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  Can you speak to that?
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  And insects are now being genetically modified to deliver vaccines.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  It's not enough to just have the live viruses in the food.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  And by the way, every genetically modified cell contains a live virus.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  It's called the cauliflower mosaic promoter virus.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  And it is itself extremely closely related to the agent involved in HIV.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  And it mutates rapidly.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  So we're already getting live viruses in our foods whose impact is unknown, at least to us, but we can...
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  Tell me if I'm correct.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  This is what the other medical doctors and genetic engineers have said.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  That is basically a bio-weapon trigger accelerator, a weaponized trigger.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  And then they used it and stick it.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  Okay.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  General, we're talking about total insanity.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  It's already causing cancer to shoot up thousands of percentile in almost every category.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  It's a total bedlam. Obviously, they're carrying out eugenics doing this.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  They're even endangering themselves.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  What is it like for you, with all of your military and intelligence training, to see this?
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  I mean, to see a plan this diabolical?
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  It is horrible. It is absolutely horrible.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  You know, you spend your life protecting all your freedoms, and then you take a look.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  You go to one of these meetings, and what do you see in front of you?
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  And, oh, by the way, we're not allowed to talk at the meeting.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  We're not allowed to express ourselves because we are just public observers.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  So we can't even speak up.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  If we need to talk, we need to talk through one of the delegations.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  And so we're sitting there essentially muzzled during this meeting.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  We couldn't say anything.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  We listened to China getting raped, essentially, and being shut up because they couldn't get their visas
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  because the United States didn't want them to come and say,
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  no, you can't put a beta agonist into the pork.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  And so you're absolutely frustrated.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  And so everything, incidentally, it is at this point where you've got to stop and say,
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  okay, where is the Achilles heel in all of this?
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  And then go after the Achilles heel because that's the only way we're going to win.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  And they have two Achilles heels.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  One is our voice and our knowledge.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  And just as you shine the light of truth on these nefarious and would-be secret activities
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  that they can't carry out once we know or they can't carry out easily once we know what they're doing
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  and say we know that this is going on, at the same time, the African countries
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  and the other poor countries of the world have the key to stopping what's going on.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  And that's why we work with them.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  That's why we visit them.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  So those are their two Achilles heels in codex.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  And let me tell you, one of the things that Reema did just before the meeting in Ottawa
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  was she prepared a paper that was so devastating against GMOs
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  that no anyone that would rate anyone that read it would say, I should never, ever do that.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  Well, we got it into the meeting.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  We got it submitted by a South African delegate.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  The U.S. was so upset with what the South African delegate had done
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  that they called her boss in South Africa.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  And I think they talked to the president of the country.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  And the minister of health.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  Apparently to the minister of health and forced South Africa to retract this devastating document.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  Well, South Africa had to.
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  I mean, the delegate had to.
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  However, we had also distributed to all of the other African delegates
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  and it got back into the system.
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  And oh, by the way, GMOs got stopped at that meeting.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  Exactly.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  Because you guys would go to the meeting.
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  The labeling.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  The labeling of GMOs.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  That makes boots on the ground.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  Now, for those that don't know, right now, 10 major food crops are GMO in the U.S.
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  They're planning to now bring in unlimited, basically take everything over
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  and they come in and buy land next to other major growth belts
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  to infect all the other crops that's come out in Monsanto documents
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  as a battle plan.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  They even call it a battle plan.
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  This is all done militarily to in Monsanto's words in 99.
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  This was even a National Geographic to infect everything with their genetic code.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  Then they own kangaroo courts that will claim that they own the world's biosphere.
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  So as bad as all the toxins and death and GMO is now,
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  am I correct in saying, doctor, it is about to explode?
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  Let me remind your listeners that the doomsday vault was not named that by you and me
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  and the other so-called conspiracy theorists, Alex.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  The doomsday vault, which contains 3 million varieties of non-genetically modified seeds
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  in a mountain in Fahlberg in the north of Norway, way above the Arctic Circle,
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  is there because when they bring about doomsday, then they'll be in their hidey holes underground.
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  We die, then they come back and hopefully for their sake.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  Through technology, they reinstate a biosphere that works
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  while they have finished off those of us who were above ground and vulnerable.
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  Now, let me stop you. A lot of their documents say that,
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  but we see that message in Moonraker and now in the new Wally movie, that's exactly what happens.
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  Precisely. But I say it doesn't happen. You say it doesn't happen.
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  And we have options. The Natural Solutions Foundation has a name that tells you something about what we do.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  We find solutions after we identify problems.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  One of the solutions is to take back the production of food.
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  And so we're creating a project in Panama to do just that.
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  Okay, I want to come back from break in the final segment with General Stubblebine and Dr. Lebo.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  Talk about that solution. But first, I'm trying to get my mind wrapped around this.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  I think I know all this stuff. I study it constantly.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  They are now going to use insects as vaccine delivery mechanisms?
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  That is correct.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  Tell me about that.
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  And who's to stop them from delivering plagues?
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  Well, I know they've done an actual test on that. That's been declassified.
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  But I mean, you're saying they're working on insects. Tell me about that.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  Yes. I have documentation that was provided by a person who lives in South Africa
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  about the worldwide program to genetically modify insects
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  allegedly to protect us against malaria through injecting certain proteins
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  and against dengue fever and yellow fever.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  And also to deliver vaccines, the one problem that they've seen with that is
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  that people who get bitten a lot might get so many doses of the vaccine
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  that it would be a health problem.
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  Can it also mutate inside the carrier?
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  Not only can it, it will.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  Inside the vector insect.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  Okay, final segment, Major General Stubblebine, Dr. Lebo,
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  and we'll give you out their website again.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  They are effectively after engaging the New World Order at point blank range.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  Got to have them up for a couple hours to debrief them when they get back.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  Now, stay with us. They are in Switzerland right now.
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  Thanks Alwin.
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:55.720]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[1:20:55.720 --> 1:21:00.680]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:21:00.680 --> 1:21:05.440]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the
[1:21:05.440 --> 1:21:10.040]  US, though the people of the US where their numbers and influence are strongest have primary
[1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:13.480]  responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice.
[1:21:13.480 --> 1:21:17.120]  All nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[1:21:17.120 --> 1:21:21.520]  They are called Illuminati, elite, opponents of the New World Order.
[1:21:21.520 --> 1:21:24.280]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:21:24.280 --> 1:21:28.800]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything they have built
[1:21:28.800 --> 1:21:33.480]  over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning
[1:21:33.480 --> 1:21:38.480]  of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority
[1:21:38.480 --> 1:21:40.800]  that has now been delegated to us.
[1:21:40.800 --> 1:21:44.640]  Visit our website at UnveilingThem.com.
[1:21:44.640 --> 1:21:50.760]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them.com, the message of his kingdom.
[1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:53.120]  Hey Bonnie, no more pickpocketing for us.
[1:21:53.120 --> 1:21:56.760]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without even knowing they've
[1:21:56.760 --> 1:21:57.760]  been robbed.
[1:21:57.760 --> 1:21:58.760]  How so Clyde?
[1:21:58.760 --> 1:22:01.960]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[1:22:01.960 --> 1:22:05.600]  Just by waving it near you, I can skim your credit card information while your card is
[1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:06.760]  still in your purse.
[1:22:06.760 --> 1:22:07.760]  Just watch.
[1:22:07.760 --> 1:22:09.920]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:11.360]  You gotta be kidding me.
[1:22:11.360 --> 1:22:16.000]  Nope, with 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:18.400]  As long as people don't hear about identity stronghold.
[1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:19.400]  Why?
[1:22:19.400 --> 1:22:20.960]  What's identity stronghold?
[1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:22.560]  They make the secure sleeve.
[1:22:22.560 --> 1:22:26.080]  When people keep their credit cards in the shielded secure sleeve, I can't read them.
[1:22:26.080 --> 1:22:29.160]  Do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve?
[1:22:29.160 --> 1:22:30.160]  No way.
[1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:33.560]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[1:22:33.560 --> 1:22:36.240]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:37.320]  I already got some.
[1:22:37.320 --> 1:22:39.600]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[1:22:39.600 --> 1:22:44.120]  Identity stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.
[1:22:44.120 --> 1:22:45.120]  idstronghold.com?
[1:22:45.120 --> 1:22:46.120]  Right.

[1:22:51.120 --> 1:22:53.920]  Terror Storm, a history of government sponsored terror.
[1:22:53.920 --> 1:22:55.360]  Loose change, final cut.
[1:22:55.360 --> 1:22:57.560]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:22:57.560 --> 1:23:02.840]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group, the late great USA, America, freedom to fascism.

[1:23:49.680 --> 1:24:00.640]  The preacher man says it's the end of time, and the Mississippi River, she's a gold drive.
[1:24:00.640 --> 1:24:11.480]  The interest is up, and the stock market is down, and you get lost if you go downtown.
[1:24:11.480 --> 1:24:14.120]  And the girl, 6'3", you got a problem.
[1:24:14.120 --> 1:24:17.560]  When she's five and has breast, you got a problem.
[1:24:17.560 --> 1:24:22.920]  Your boys are hyper-feminine, your women are ultra-feminine, the hormones, the estrogen
[1:24:22.920 --> 1:24:27.000]  mimicking systems alone are devastating.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:30.240]  This isn't a joke, women, that's why breast cancer keeps spiraling upward and upward,
[1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:34.040]  and they give you all these fake reasons, and you go on the jogging track, and you go
[1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:35.960]  and you have these little events.
[1:24:35.960 --> 1:24:36.960]  It's a big industry.
[1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:40.840]  They glamorize your death, they glamorize the men dying.
[1:24:40.840 --> 1:24:41.840]  It's totally sick.
[1:24:41.840 --> 1:24:46.720]  We've got about four minutes left, General Stubblebine, Dr. Lebo, you're there in Switzerland
[1:24:46.720 --> 1:24:51.680]  covering CODEX 2008, the big global meeting, in closing.
[1:24:51.680 --> 1:24:55.800]  What are some of the things they're doing, their agenda, and how do we stop them?
[1:24:55.800 --> 1:25:00.680]  Well, let me jump in right quick.
[1:25:00.680 --> 1:25:05.480]  First and foremost, all of our funding comes from little people.
[1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:11.600]  We get contributions from just individuals.
[1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:13.440]  We don't have any government backing.
[1:25:13.440 --> 1:25:18.440]  We don't have any large backing from commerce.
[1:25:18.440 --> 1:25:26.960]  We depend entirely on the contributions that come from little people like your listeners.
[1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:34.440]  You could make a recurring donation to us, just a dollar a month would be a great help
[1:25:34.440 --> 1:25:39.920]  to get us to these meetings, to give us the resources so we can go and do the fights that
[1:25:39.920 --> 1:25:40.920]  need to be brought.
[1:25:40.920 --> 1:25:45.200]  Well, you guys had a world-renowned clinic, you gave that up four years ago to go out
[1:25:45.200 --> 1:25:46.200]  and do this.
[1:25:46.200 --> 1:25:47.200]  That's correct.
[1:25:47.200 --> 1:25:48.200]  That's exactly right.
[1:25:48.200 --> 1:25:52.200]  We gave up every bit of what we used to have as income.
[1:25:52.200 --> 1:25:53.440]  We do not have that anymore.
[1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:58.640]  We've spent about $800,000 of our own money, and frankly, we're just about tapped out.
[1:25:58.640 --> 1:26:02.360]  So, if we don't do this together, it doesn't happen.
[1:26:02.360 --> 1:26:03.360]  Very, very simple.
[1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:05.720]  We've got a back here mission.
[1:26:05.720 --> 1:26:07.680]  We've got a back here mission.
[1:26:07.680 --> 1:26:08.680]  Thank you.
[1:26:08.680 --> 1:26:09.680]  Thank you.
[1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:17.080]  You can go to our website, healthfreedomusa.org, push on the button, contribute, and you can
[1:26:17.080 --> 1:26:23.000]  also sign up for the health freedom alert and then take the actions and disseminate
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:24.240]  the emails.
[1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:27.800]  But you can also start eating organic.
[1:26:27.800 --> 1:26:31.560]  If you're eating the standard American diet, if you're eating prepared food, you're killing
[1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:32.560]  yourself.
[1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:35.120]  If you're feeding it to your children, you're killing them.
[1:26:35.120 --> 1:26:40.240]  Healthfreedomusa.org, healthfreedomusa.org, I mean, I want to be clear, I've had Nobel
[1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:45.400]  Prize winners, top scientists, probably 40, 50 of them over the last six, seven years,
[1:26:45.400 --> 1:26:48.880]  genetic engineers who were making millions a year working for companies, and then they
[1:26:48.880 --> 1:26:54.240]  would feed, say, a potato in one case that had new amino acids alone because they changed
[1:26:54.240 --> 1:26:58.200]  one thing in the potato, but it would randomly change hundreds of other things each time
[1:26:58.200 --> 1:27:03.600]  it replicated, and it would kill all the rats, and he said, you can't approve this.
[1:27:03.600 --> 1:27:06.480]  And they said, we approve it, and it's been on the market for a decade.
[1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:11.680]  I mean, that's one example, and now the horrors, and we're eating this, and this is killing
[1:27:11.680 --> 1:27:12.680]  us.
[1:27:12.680 --> 1:27:15.840]  And there's no safety testing, none, zero.
[1:27:15.840 --> 1:27:20.720]  The whole world here at Codex believes that the United States conducts safety testing
[1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:22.440]  on genetically modified food.
[1:27:22.440 --> 1:27:28.520]  The truth is that it's illegal to label it, and the U.S. government is prohibited from
[1:27:28.520 --> 1:27:34.680]  conducting or examining safety testing on genetically modified food, but they approve
[1:27:34.680 --> 1:27:40.480]  it all on principle, the principle of evil, of course, and you eat it, and you die.
[1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:43.040]  So, you organic, grow your own food.
[1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:47.040]  And the U.N. has said they are using food as a weapon, not just of starvation, but
[1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:54.760]  as PDD 200 says, as the State Department of Random says, this is a biological eugenics
[1:27:54.760 --> 1:28:01.240]  program, 100 times the size of the Manhattan Project, their entire world agenda is about
[1:28:01.240 --> 1:28:02.240]  killing us.
[1:28:02.240 --> 1:28:04.240]  General, do you agree?
[1:28:04.240 --> 1:28:05.240]  We agree.
[1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:10.400]  I have been with the general to the poorest places in the world, Alex, and I've asked
[1:28:10.400 --> 1:28:16.600]  people who have no hope, people in Ethiopia who are dying of endless misery and starvation,
[1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:20.880]  the abjectly poor, and I've said, would the useless eaters among you please hold up your
[1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:24.160]  hand, those who are willing to die for the new world order?
[1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:27.480]  Would you please just come up here and lie down and die?
[1:28:27.480 --> 1:28:28.480]  And you know what?
[1:28:28.480 --> 1:28:29.480]  The answer is none.
[1:28:29.480 --> 1:28:30.480]  Nobody ever said yeah.
[1:28:30.480 --> 1:28:31.480]  Take me.
[1:28:31.480 --> 1:28:32.480]  Not one.
[1:28:32.480 --> 1:28:33.480]  Not one.
[1:28:33.480 --> 1:28:36.480]  Well, you know, we need to take these globalists down.
[1:28:36.480 --> 1:28:40.440]  They need to be tried, and if humans are so bad, they need to go first.
[1:28:40.440 --> 1:28:41.440]  You know what?
[1:28:41.440 --> 1:28:42.680]  This is a winnable war.
[1:28:42.680 --> 1:28:46.960]  We need the resources to win it, and sadly, people just sort of sit around and say, well,
[1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:49.680]  maybe somebody else will do it, or maybe they won't.
[1:28:49.680 --> 1:28:51.240]  A lot of people don't have the initiative.
[1:28:51.240 --> 1:28:54.560]  I have taken action in my life and seen nothing but success.
[1:28:54.560 --> 1:28:56.360]  That's why you and the general are dangerous.
[1:28:56.360 --> 1:28:57.360]  He's had success.
[1:28:57.360 --> 1:28:58.360]  You've had success.
[1:28:58.360 --> 1:29:02.280]  You know this is winnable, and I'm telling the listeners, if you're not going to do it,
[1:29:02.280 --> 1:29:03.280]  nobody is.
[1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:04.560]  You have to take action.
[1:29:04.560 --> 1:29:09.120]  It starts by getting control of your life and only eating properly certified organic
[1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:10.120]  food.
[1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:11.120]  It starts there, doesn't it?
[1:29:11.120 --> 1:29:12.120]  It sure does.
[1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:15.800]  And it also starts with their voices, saying no.
[1:29:15.800 --> 1:29:20.960]  And that's why we ask people to become mouse warriors by going to the website Health Freedom
[1:29:20.960 --> 1:29:24.800]  USA.org and signing up for the Health Freedom Alerts.
[1:29:24.800 --> 1:29:28.360]  You have no idea how important that is until you see your success.
[1:29:28.360 --> 1:29:31.120]  General, doctor, thank you both for joining us.
[1:29:31.120 --> 1:29:32.960]  Please report back as soon as you can.
[1:29:32.960 --> 1:29:33.960]  Thanks, Alex.
[1:29:33.960 --> 1:29:34.960]  Thank you.
[1:29:34.960 --> 1:29:35.960]  We'll talk to you soon.
[1:29:35.960 --> 1:29:36.960]  God bless.
[1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:37.960]  We'll be right back.
[1:29:37.960 --> 1:29:42.880]  We're on the march.
[1:29:42.880 --> 1:29:45.320]  The empire's on the run.
[1:29:45.320 --> 1:29:52.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:52.560 --> 1:29:56.320]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of
[1:29:56.320 --> 1:29:58.840]  disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[1:29:58.840 --> 1:30:02.880]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and
[1:30:02.880 --> 1:30:04.600]  our high stress lifestyles.
[1:30:04.600 --> 1:30:08.680]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[1:30:08.680 --> 1:30:13.200]  The easiest way to reduce disease causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized
[1:30:13.200 --> 1:30:14.200]  water.
[1:30:14.200 --> 1:30:18.680]  At NiterHealth.com, we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science,

[1:31:51.040 --> 1:31:56.680]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Sierra
[1:31:56.680 --> 1:32:00.200]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[1:32:00.200 --> 1:32:05.480]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:07.160]  to tell their story.
[1:32:07.160 --> 1:32:16.080]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:32:16.080 --> 1:32:20.840]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world
[1:32:20.840 --> 1:32:23.120]  take action against their global masters.
[1:32:23.120 --> 1:32:26.280]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:32:26.280 --> 1:32:32.080]  He takes his hand off and you hear it 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:32:32.080 --> 1:32:39.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide, download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:44.120]  aggressively spread it worldwide, or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:32:44.120 --> 1:32:47.800]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[1:32:47.800 --> 1:33:07.920]  and bring in martial law.
[1:33:07.920 --> 1:33:12.560]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time, we're here live.
[1:33:12.560 --> 1:33:17.520]  Jason Murmurs will be sitting in for me tomorrow when Truth Rising is released at Prison Planet
[1:33:17.520 --> 1:33:23.680]  dot tv and on DVD at infowars.com, Truth is rising all across the world.
[1:33:23.680 --> 1:33:27.720]  The people are waking up to the global crime syndicate for their activities, taking over
[1:33:27.720 --> 1:33:31.960]  our food, our water, our resources, our liberties, our freedoms.
[1:33:31.960 --> 1:33:36.520]  We are joined by Congressman Ron Paul, Dr. Ron Paul, for the rest of this hour, the
[1:33:36.520 --> 1:33:40.880]  next 25 minutes or so, to cover what's happening with the economy, what's happening with the
[1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:46.420]  buildup for war with Iran, what's developing here domestically, both parties basically
[1:33:46.420 --> 1:33:50.160]  coming out for torture, coming out for warrantless wiretapping.
[1:33:50.160 --> 1:33:54.080]  We'll cover the gamut, but before we go any further, tragically last Thursday, we didn't
[1:33:54.080 --> 1:33:57.080]  learn about it until Monday because the family was private.
[1:33:57.080 --> 1:34:04.000]  The head of the Ron Paul 2008 campaign, friends with Ron Paul since 87, Kent Schneider, just
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:09.880]  a great guy who you could call at 10 o'clock at night on a Sunday about getting Ron Paul
[1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:10.880]  on or some event.
[1:34:10.880 --> 1:34:16.480]  I mean, he just worked around the clock, lost a eight-plus-week battle with double viral
[1:34:16.480 --> 1:34:20.080]  pneumonia, and I wanted to spend a few minutes remembering him with the Congressman who's
[1:34:20.080 --> 1:34:22.120]  on the hill right now.
[1:34:22.120 --> 1:34:24.960]  Congressman, I'd like to say it's good to have you on, but I'd like to have you on under
[1:34:24.960 --> 1:34:25.960]  better circumstances.
[1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:27.960]  Yes, it would be nice.
[1:34:27.960 --> 1:34:30.680]  It's really a sad event.
[1:34:30.680 --> 1:34:35.440]  Kent worked with me and for me in the campaign in 1988.
[1:34:35.440 --> 1:34:39.880]  He was a college student back then, and that was the Libertarian campaign.
[1:34:39.880 --> 1:34:41.920]  And he's worked for me essentially ever since.
[1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:46.720]  There was a small break there, but he was involved in D.C. with me, and then he was the
[1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:52.840]  one that I gave credit to for really giving me the final sales pitch, and I think even
[1:34:52.840 --> 1:34:57.520]  you had encouraged me to run before I did, and a lot of people did, but it was finally
[1:34:57.520 --> 1:35:05.320]  Kent who sat down and outlined the value of it, and so I give him a lot of credit.
[1:35:05.320 --> 1:35:09.840]  If we did achieve anything, if it was a worthwhile venture, which I believe it has been, I'd
[1:35:09.840 --> 1:35:13.160]  say, and Kent deserves a lot of credit for it.
[1:35:13.160 --> 1:35:18.760]  Congressman, since you mentioned the worthwhile venture and Kent pushing you over the edge
[1:35:18.760 --> 1:35:25.960]  or the camel straw that set all this in motion, the straw that broke the camel's back, we've
[1:35:25.960 --> 1:35:30.640]  had a great victory, and I always want the listeners to realize that tens of millions
[1:35:30.640 --> 1:35:32.960]  of people now know the Federal Reserve as private.
[1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:39.560]  They know about the currency tax, the inflation tax, they know about the New World Order instead
[1:35:39.560 --> 1:35:45.080]  of either being a fake neocon or communist choice on the colleges, everywhere I go and
[1:35:45.080 --> 1:35:50.600]  all the people I've talked to say the new dominant force isn't liberal or conservative.
[1:35:50.600 --> 1:35:58.760]  It is true liberty, what you'd call constitutionalist, and you running just has energized so much.
[1:35:58.760 --> 1:35:59.760]  Can you speak to that?
[1:35:59.760 --> 1:36:04.440]  Well, you know, we discovered there were a lot of folks that had been around for a bit
[1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:09.040]  and have known about it, and you've talked to them for many, many years, and I knew there
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:14.120]  were a large number of individuals like that, but I didn't know how the young people would
[1:36:14.120 --> 1:36:15.120]  respond.
[1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:20.640]  And to me, it's amazing how the young generation has just jumped on this, realized what's going
[1:36:20.640 --> 1:36:25.600]  on, and they put it together that the burden of debt and the war is going on in the welfare
[1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:26.600]  state.
[1:36:26.600 --> 1:36:32.120]  And so many young people that come to my office now and talk to me, they said, boy, did you
[1:36:32.120 --> 1:36:35.720]  open up my eyes about the Federal Reserve, I've been studying that.
[1:36:35.720 --> 1:36:42.480]  So I think, you know, we've really lit a fire, and that does not meet personally.
[1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:46.680]  I mean, it was everybody put together, people like you that have been involved for a long
[1:36:46.680 --> 1:36:52.600]  time, plus everybody else, but you know, a lot of people got after me for this recent
[1:36:52.600 --> 1:36:53.600]  audio artist.
[1:36:53.600 --> 1:36:56.280]  I don't know, he's too optimistic, they think we can do some good.
[1:36:56.280 --> 1:37:01.760]  Well, I'm cautiously optimistic, and I know what kind of a fight we have up to, but I am
[1:37:01.760 --> 1:37:07.520]  a bit more optimistic now because of the response that we have had and the willingness of so
[1:37:07.520 --> 1:37:13.480]  many people willing to look at the Federal Reserve, but we also have to realize how powerful
[1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:17.640]  they are and how much control they have and how they run their government.
[1:37:17.640 --> 1:37:20.560]  But at least I think we're being more competitive.
[1:37:20.560 --> 1:37:27.800]  Congressman, I agree, I mean, you can't overstate the effect this has had, your running has
[1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:28.800]  had.
[1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:36.520]  You broke the dam, I see that as a major new plateau in the reawakening of liberty, a new
[1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:46.040]  renaissance, legalizing freedom as you've put it so well, and it is just almost immeasurable
[1:37:46.040 --> 1:37:47.040]  what's happened.
[1:37:47.040 --> 1:37:52.360]  We know we're in a lot better place with the public being informed than we were just a
[1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:56.080]  year and a half ago, and again, you're right, the credit goes to the tens of millions of
[1:37:56.080 --> 1:38:00.600]  Ron Paul supporters that have energized and woken up so many people, and the victory
[1:38:00.600 --> 1:38:06.560]  is in resistance, and the victory is in that both parties are basically intellectually
[1:38:06.560 --> 1:38:07.560]  bankrupt.
[1:38:07.560 --> 1:38:11.600]  The public now, as you know, in major polls, Congress has like a 12% approval rating, Bush
[1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:16.800]  has got like a 24%, Cheney's got like a 10%, Hillary's got a 12%, I mean, for the first
[1:38:16.800 --> 1:38:20.800]  time, both parties are discredited, and that's a good thing, isn't it?
[1:38:20.800 --> 1:38:28.960]  Oh, absolutely, I think, you know, truth is what we're after, and the fact that the government
[1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:34.160]  is feeling at everything that they do, whether it's the monetary system, the welfare state,
[1:38:34.160 --> 1:38:40.000]  the protection of our freedoms, or our foreign policy, it's so obvious that that is the
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:43.040]  reason we have such a vital role to play.
[1:38:43.040 --> 1:38:48.800]  We can complain, we can put out all the problems and condemn the Fed, and the IRS, but we have
[1:38:48.800 --> 1:38:54.560]  to come up with something that is very positive, and that is our job to present the case for
[1:38:54.560 --> 1:38:59.880]  the concept of liberty, and, you know, our bill of rights, and what America used to stand
[1:38:59.880 --> 1:39:05.080]  for in property rights, so we have to also have the program that will give the answers
[1:39:05.080 --> 1:39:06.720]  to the problems that we have.
[1:39:06.720 --> 1:39:11.920]  Giving people a real solution, it's one thing to say, those are bad choices, which is true,
[1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:13.800]  we're now giving people an option.
[1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:18.760]  Tell us briefly about the shift in the campaign to this new organization, and how the people
[1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:23.280]  can energize that even more than it already is energized, Congressman.
[1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:26.560]  Well, it's been going well.
[1:39:26.560 --> 1:39:30.840]  We have a new group, it's called Campaign for Liberty, it's just a continuation of the
[1:39:30.840 --> 1:39:35.080]  other campaign, it's always a campaign for liberty as far as I'm concerned, and it's
[1:39:35.080 --> 1:39:41.280]  in its early stages, and of course we're backing and then promoting right now the big rally
[1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:48.600]  in Washington on July 12th, and I'll be there, and we're pushing that, but then of course
[1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:53.480]  the new organization will be pushing very, very hard, our rally up in Minneapolis at
[1:39:53.480 --> 1:39:58.640]  the same time, the Republicans are having their rally, and this will be a positive rally
[1:39:58.640 --> 1:40:03.320]  for all the views and all the good things that we stand for, so if anybody's interested
[1:40:03.320 --> 1:40:10.760]  in that, it's really easy to find out more about the organization and just go to campaignforliberty.com,
[1:40:10.760 --> 1:40:16.320]  and we do now have, I think it's 66,000 people have joined, our goal is to have 100,000
[1:40:16.320 --> 1:40:21.880]  by September 2nd, and I think we will, I mean we had quite a few more than that in the other
[1:40:21.880 --> 1:40:29.280]  campaign, and I think it's going to grow and have a very beneficial effect on all that
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:33.080]  we do, and we're working conjunction with all the other freedom groups.
[1:40:33.080 --> 1:40:37.640]  Absolutely, and I want to restate the obvious, because some people don't consciously understand
[1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:44.200]  this, 2% started the Revolutionary War when the British came to confiscate the guns, and
[1:40:44.200 --> 1:40:49.520]  it was about 5% that beat the greatest army on earth that had never been defeated.
[1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:54.520]  The British Redcoats were called the Invincibles at that time, because they beat everybody,
[1:40:54.520 --> 1:41:00.280]  they went on a few years later to beat Napoleon, and we lost most of those battles, but it
[1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:06.400]  was the willingness to keep coming back to the fight that finally brought down that enemy,
[1:41:06.400 --> 1:41:11.320]  and we're going to be remembering that tomorrow, can you say some words about what America
[1:41:11.320 --> 1:41:18.400]  is really about in its second birth, I think this is a very important July 4th that we're
[1:41:18.400 --> 1:41:21.240]  going to be having in less than 24 hours, Congressman.
[1:41:21.240 --> 1:41:26.160]  Well, the wonderful thing about our Revolution is it proved the old adage that ideas do have
[1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:27.160]  consequences.
[1:41:27.160 --> 1:41:32.000]  The founders weren't just a rag tag, a bunch of guys getting together and saying well let's
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:33.680]  go after the British.
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:40.320]  They were philosophers, and they knew history, and they had this all put together, and they
[1:41:40.320 --> 1:41:42.040]  knew and understood it.
[1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:48.480]  Now the most unique thing about our Revolution was that for the most part, when revolutions
[1:41:48.480 --> 1:41:52.840]  usually come about, they come about by the failure of one state and somebody else comes
[1:41:52.840 --> 1:41:58.120]  in, and usually one group of thugs replaces another group of thugs, our Revolution was
[1:41:58.120 --> 1:42:03.520]  unique in that the people had more freedom rather than less freedom, and it wasn't just
[1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:07.560]  a replacement of one group of authoritarians with another group.
[1:42:07.560 --> 1:42:12.120]  Just like with the French Revolution, instead of just being just as bad, it got even worse.
[1:42:12.120 --> 1:42:16.560]  That's right, and it was all done, you know, the Jacobins were, oh they were delightful
[1:42:16.560 --> 1:42:21.560]  people, some people compare them to the Neocons, to the Jacobins, oh we're all doing this for
[1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:26.200]  the goodness of the country and the people, we're over there helping the people of Iraq
[1:42:26.200 --> 1:42:31.760]  and we're going to take care of people home, at home here, so yes, but they can turn into
[1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:37.280]  thugs when they say well we are such good people, we are going to force you to do it
[1:42:37.280 --> 1:42:42.480]  and if you don't obey us and if you don't become good like we are, we're going to kill
[1:42:42.480 --> 1:42:43.480]  you.
[1:42:43.480 --> 1:42:47.680]  So, and this is what we're approaching, I'll just think of all these laws that have been
[1:42:47.680 --> 1:42:54.640]  put on the books today, so far they haven't rounded up tens of thousands, but there's
[1:42:54.640 --> 1:42:58.880]  hints that they might if they get out of hand because they certainly have the authority
[1:42:58.880 --> 1:43:04.920]  on the books now, so it's going to be a tough fight and that's why our ideas and the ideas
[1:43:04.920 --> 1:43:11.320]  or continuation of the founders ideas must have consequences, you know, armies can't
[1:43:11.320 --> 1:43:17.600]  stop an idea whose time has come and that's why I still remain optimistic and you're
[1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:23.120]  absolutely right, you don't have to wait for a vote of 51% of the people to endorse our
[1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:29.120]  ideas, you have to have people that are ideologically dedicated and then they will go out and do
[1:43:29.120 --> 1:43:33.280]  the work and the others will come along, especially when they see the failure of one
[1:43:33.280 --> 1:43:38.240]  system and they know it has to be replaced and if they have any common sense, why do
[1:43:38.240 --> 1:43:42.040]  they want to replace it with another authoritarian government?
[1:43:42.040 --> 1:43:46.040]  Why don't we go back to the positive attitude about how freedom works?
[1:43:46.040 --> 1:43:52.400]  Well, I agree with you and I love the Victor Hugo quotes, no army can stop an idea whose
[1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:57.440]  time has come, that's actually how my new film, Truth Rising, I'll send you a copy,
[1:43:57.440 --> 1:44:02.560]  Congressman Starts, is with that quote, but you're right, we can't just let the old system
[1:44:02.560 --> 1:44:06.760]  fall apart on its own weight, which it clearly is going to do, the question is next month
[1:44:06.760 --> 1:44:11.320]  or five years from now, you know, could happen any time, probably sooner rather than later,
[1:44:11.320 --> 1:44:17.120]  but will it fall into something even worse, some new socialism or some new fascism or
[1:44:17.120 --> 1:44:22.560]  will we be there at the time of, you know, where the system is liquid during a revolution,
[1:44:22.560 --> 1:44:27.800]  it becomes liquid to get control of the reins and then get us back to sound money and a
[1:44:27.800 --> 1:44:33.160]  sound system and restore the republic that you've been working so hard to do, sir.
[1:44:33.160 --> 1:44:38.560]  I want to now in the 15 minutes or so that we have left with you to get into Iran, get
[1:44:38.560 --> 1:44:42.760]  into the situation in Iraq, and also want to get into the economy, it's all tied together
[1:44:42.760 --> 1:44:50.160]  obviously with oil now going up to 146 a barrel, mainstream news, Bloomberg is admitting, OPEC
[1:44:50.160 --> 1:44:55.320]  is saying, look, the dollar has plunged, 72% of oil increases, the dollar plunging, then
[1:44:55.320 --> 1:44:59.480]  people are dumping the dollar, that causes speculation, everything you warned about when
[1:44:59.480 --> 1:45:05.200]  it had doubled three years ago, now it's doubled again, now they're talking about $8 a gallon
[1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:11.320]  gas if we attack, you're talking about in a story here for Press TV, Ron Paul, Iran
[1:45:11.320 --> 1:45:16.160]  will triple energy prices, break down what we're going to see with energy if we don't
[1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:19.160]  attack or what you think will happen if we do.
[1:45:19.160 --> 1:45:22.880]  Well if we do, it's going to be a disaster, obviously it's going to be pushed up.
[1:45:22.880 --> 1:45:27.240]  The other day I was astounded on one of the business stations, they were talking about
[1:45:27.240 --> 1:45:33.280]  Iran, and they were talking about in terms of not, are we going to, but the debate was,
[1:45:33.280 --> 1:45:37.560]  you think they're going to bomb before the election or after the election, so it's sort
[1:45:37.560 --> 1:45:43.120]  of like a foregone conclusion that we're going to, and why would the oil prices be
[1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:47.360]  bit up, so there is a lot of speculation, there's a lot of that, and then they turn
[1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:51.520]  around and say, well, it's the speculators that are doing it, well, the speculators
[1:45:51.520 --> 1:45:56.520]  are sometimes smart people, their job is to go out and speculate and find out what the
[1:45:56.520 --> 1:46:01.680]  price is due to current events, monetary policy, and financial trouble, and foreign
[1:46:01.680 --> 1:46:07.840]  policy, so these are legitimate intelligent people who are bidding up the price of oil
[1:46:07.840 --> 1:46:11.240]  because of the potential of a war.
[1:46:11.240 --> 1:46:15.320]  I kept saying in the campaign, you know, if I had my way, they said, well, what would
[1:46:15.320 --> 1:46:17.040]  you do immediately if you were elected president?
[1:46:17.040 --> 1:46:21.280]  I said, I'd bring our troops home, and I'd bring our navy out of the Persian Gulf, and
[1:46:21.280 --> 1:46:26.040]  I said the dollar would probably go up in value, and we would eliminate the risk premium.
[1:46:26.040 --> 1:46:33.240]  Probably oil prices would drop precipitously, and it would be just by removing this threat,
[1:46:33.240 --> 1:46:39.760]  but you know, next week, possibly that resolution, H.J. Res 362, I believe it is, if that comes
[1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:46.640]  up, it is demanding the president put on an absolute blockade of the entire country
[1:46:46.640 --> 1:46:53.880]  of Iran and punish any country or any business group around the world if they trade with
[1:46:53.880 --> 1:46:54.880]  Iran.
[1:46:54.880 --> 1:46:59.680]  I mean, this is very, very serious business, and experts are saying we're going to see
[1:46:59.680 --> 1:47:02.040]  $6 a gallon gas if that happens immediately.
[1:47:02.040 --> 1:47:03.040]  Right.
[1:47:03.040 --> 1:47:08.240]  I mean, we may get there just by anticipation, but when it happens, and then what if the
[1:47:08.240 --> 1:47:11.640]  Iranians are capable of sinking a couple ships out there?
[1:47:11.640 --> 1:47:15.040]  Or if it accidentally happens in a Gulf of Tonkin.
[1:47:15.040 --> 1:47:22.000]  Yeah, that's true, but the other thing is, it's risking 150,000 Americans in Iraq.
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:26.160]  I mean, do you think they don't know the potential problems coming?
[1:47:26.160 --> 1:47:29.320]  Do you think that they are not working with their allies in Iraq?
[1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:34.120]  I mean, could they blockade and actually squeeze our troops to that point?
[1:47:34.120 --> 1:47:38.120]  I mean, you just can't get enough helicopters to fly these people out of there.
[1:47:38.120 --> 1:47:42.720]  Well, what happens if the neocons launch 2,000 Saudis, as they're saying they'll do, bomb
[1:47:42.720 --> 1:47:52.560]  the infrastructure with Saddam or the U.S.-backed military in that eight-year war when Iraq
[1:47:52.560 --> 1:47:54.640]  was a first-world nation.
[1:47:54.640 --> 1:47:58.040]  They barely could beat the Iranians, and the Iranians lost a million.
[1:47:58.040 --> 1:48:02.440]  Now the Iranians are built up to analysts say about twice the strength they had in the
[1:48:02.440 --> 1:48:09.120]  80s, and they're saying they will overrun and go into Iraq, and unless the U.S. uses
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:14.480]  nukes, they will completely overrun our military, and this is a Custer Last Stand situation.
[1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:19.400]  Yeah, and the frightening thing is, is they say that they don't take no options off the
[1:48:19.400 --> 1:48:25.000]  tables, even nuclear first strikes, so if they're really determined and they keep pointing
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:31.400]  out that there are some plans for the Iranians to retaliate, that might give them the argument,
[1:48:31.400 --> 1:48:38.880]  well, they might retaliate, so we better bomb all their military sites, and these people
[1:48:38.880 --> 1:48:45.240]  in the administration are capable of advising the use of nuclear power and nuclear weapons.
[1:48:45.240 --> 1:48:48.800]  Oh yeah, they've been preparing the public, and you're right, just in the last week, they've
[1:48:48.800 --> 1:48:53.680]  gone from, we're probably going to attack Iran too, is it going to happen before the
[1:48:53.680 --> 1:49:01.360]  election in November or in between that time when Obama or McCain comes in January 23rd,
[1:49:01.360 --> 1:49:06.760]  and so we're now hearing foregone conclusion, we only saw that right before the last two
[1:49:06.760 --> 1:49:12.880]  Gulf Wars, I mean, Deserty, what are you hearing on the Hill, I mean, has it been green-lighted?
[1:49:12.880 --> 1:49:21.120]  That is my sense, because the Democratic leadership in the House are proposing no resistance whatsoever,
[1:49:21.120 --> 1:49:26.880]  we saw that when this supplemental bill came up, when the President asked for 107 billion
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:32.800]  dollars for the war, the Democrat leadership gave him 162 billion dollars, and they are
[1:49:32.800 --> 1:49:39.760]  not resisting it, the leadership of the Democratic Party is solidly behind this blockade, they
[1:49:39.760 --> 1:49:45.240]  already have 220 members who have signed on the bill well over the number that they need
[1:49:45.240 --> 1:49:49.560]  to pass it, they're so confident that they think, I imagine they'll bring this up under
[1:49:49.560 --> 1:49:57.520]  suspension, so no, I think they're very much ready, but they don't think any further than
[1:49:57.520 --> 1:50:01.360]  their front of their nose, I mean, they're not saying, well, could this be like what
[1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:07.280]  we did to Iraq, could this backfire on it, they just march right on, and as long as
[1:50:07.280 --> 1:50:11.960]  I've been there, as long as I've studied it, it still is totally bewildering to me when
[1:50:11.960 --> 1:50:18.080]  I see men and women in the Congress I know and like and talk with, and I don't think
[1:50:18.080 --> 1:50:25.600]  that they're doing this because they think it's going to materially benefit them, they
[1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:29.880]  just do it to go along, to get along, and they've been convinced, most of them will
[1:50:29.880 --> 1:50:35.400]  come across and say, oh yes, I agree with you on all you say, but the Iranians are bad
[1:50:35.400 --> 1:50:39.400]  people and they might attack us some day and we can't let them have, they buy into all
[1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:43.040]  the propaganda, they never stop and think about it.
[1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:47.480]  Okay, Congressman, I'm actually for, Internet listeners going to skip this break coming
[1:50:47.480 --> 1:50:54.320]  up right now, for others we'll be right back in about three minutes.
[1:50:54.320 --> 1:50:59.000]  Last month, Ready Reserve Food stated that by fall, food would be in short supply and
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:03.240]  the government would be forced to impose controls on food and food distribution because of civil
[1:51:03.240 --> 1:51:04.800]  unrest and panic.
[1:51:04.800 --> 1:51:09.280]  Well, the floods in the heartland of America have all but assured this will happen.
[1:51:09.280 --> 1:51:14.480]  It is estimated that 5 million acres of farmland will not be producing over 700 million bushels
[1:51:14.480 --> 1:51:16.080]  of corn alone.
[1:51:16.080 --> 1:51:20.520]  If you have ever thought about storing food, now is the time to do so.

[1:52:50.760 --> 1:52:55.560]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned
[1:52:55.560 --> 1:52:56.760]  TV on your computer?

[1:53:08.760 --> 1:53:09.760]  Here's the story.
[1:53:09.760 --> 1:53:14.080]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant
[1:53:14.080 --> 1:53:18.000]  access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:19.200]  And here's the best part.
[1:53:19.200 --> 1:53:20.920]  It's 100% legal.
[1:53:20.920 --> 1:53:25.280]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels

[1:54:42.960 --> 1:54:47.000]  To me, the biggest challenge has been, the biggest eye-opener has been in these last
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:53.680]  several years is how strongly some of our Christian evangelical groups join in.
[1:54:53.680 --> 1:54:58.040]  That is so disturbing to me, and yet they do.
[1:54:58.040 --> 1:55:03.640]  The Christian Zionist groups are urging this on in the name of Christianity.
[1:55:03.640 --> 1:55:07.560]  I mean, they didn't learn the same Christianity that I learned.
[1:55:07.560 --> 1:55:14.120]  I just cannot conceive of this, and yet there are millions that way that are just pushing
[1:55:14.120 --> 1:55:20.120]  this war and pushing even nuclear weapons in the name of spreading Christian love.
[1:55:20.120 --> 1:55:26.280]  Premeditated mass murder hit Larry, and to say the least, in closing, two final questions.
[1:55:26.280 --> 1:55:27.800]  When are you hearing they're probably going to hit?
[1:55:27.800 --> 1:55:33.280]  We're hearing September, October from people like Ray McGovern and others with the CIA.
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:37.520]  Well, I don't think I have any inside information.
[1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:39.920]  It would be just a gut reaction.
[1:55:39.920 --> 1:55:45.400]  I don't think it'll be, I don't think it's going to be before September, but I think
[1:55:45.400 --> 1:55:50.640]  it's quite capable of happening before the November election.
[1:55:50.640 --> 1:55:54.040]  A huge October surprise.
[1:55:54.040 --> 1:56:00.000]  It would be, of course, it would be maybe surprise to some others, it would be just
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:03.720]  the shocking reality of something that we weren't able to stop for us.
[1:56:03.720 --> 1:56:08.000]  Yeah, it's like watching World War II coming, nothing you can do to stop it.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:13.840]  Congressman the economy, Joseph Stakeless, Nobel Prize winner on Heather Newark Business
[1:56:13.840 --> 1:56:18.680]  School on Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, so you know, so many others on there all saying total
[1:56:18.680 --> 1:56:22.320]  inflationary depression within two and a half years.
[1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:23.320]  What do you say?
[1:56:23.320 --> 1:56:27.200]  Because it looks like things are accelerating right now, faster than what their timetables
[1:56:27.200 --> 1:56:28.200]  were.
[1:56:28.200 --> 1:56:31.880]  Well, my statement yesterday raised the question that everybody realizes that we're having
[1:56:31.880 --> 1:56:32.880]  stagflation.
[1:56:32.880 --> 1:56:34.200]  We are in a downturn.
[1:56:34.200 --> 1:56:37.480]  The government hasn't even admitted that we have a recession and everybody knows the
[1:56:37.480 --> 1:56:39.160]  inflation is roaring.
[1:56:39.160 --> 1:56:43.520]  To me, the only question was is when are we going to ask the question to admit that we're
[1:56:43.520 --> 1:56:47.480]  moving toward an inflationary depression?
[1:56:47.480 --> 1:56:51.640]  And I used to be thought that when you had inflation, you had a vibrant economy, which
[1:56:51.640 --> 1:56:53.120]  is not true.
[1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:57.200]  And I think, you know, within six months or a year, we're going to start to sense that,
[1:56:57.200 --> 1:57:02.560]  but once again, I don't say that I know exactly what it'll be like in 12 months.
[1:57:02.560 --> 1:57:09.360]  It may slip into this inflationary depression, but we are on the way down.
[1:57:09.360 --> 1:57:13.280]  The inflation is going up, the dollar will continue to go down, the economy is going
[1:57:13.280 --> 1:57:18.120]  to continue to weaken, and so far, they're not doing the right things, so the longer
[1:57:18.120 --> 1:57:21.400]  they do the wrong things, the longer this thing will be prolonged.
[1:57:21.400 --> 1:57:24.880]  But it's the right thing for them because it gives the central banks more power control.
[1:57:24.880 --> 1:57:30.160]  Though for the first time, I'm seeing the IMF central banks criticize the Federal Reserve.
[1:57:30.160 --> 1:57:34.520]  Are they getting ready to pin everything on Bernanke when it was Alan Greenspan that
[1:57:34.520 --> 1:57:36.320]  engineered all this?
[1:57:36.320 --> 1:57:40.000]  They'll have to have a scapegoat, but they're not going to give up their power, and it may
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:41.600]  become more international.
[1:57:41.600 --> 1:57:43.760]  I think the power is already international.
[1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:50.520]  The fact that we were able to export our inflation for so long was an agreement, I think, with
[1:57:50.520 --> 1:57:56.360]  the among the central banks, where they were monetizing our debt and prolonging this, but
[1:57:56.360 --> 1:58:00.480]  now it's the reversal, and they'll be lining up to pick up the pieces.
[1:58:00.480 --> 1:58:05.200]  He has the New York Times' best-selling book out, Revolution, a Manifesto.
[1:58:05.200 --> 1:58:07.200]  We carry it at infoawards.com.
[1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:08.200]  Discounted.
[1:58:08.200 --> 1:58:09.200]  Hope you'll get it there.
[1:58:09.200 --> 1:58:11.080]  Congressman, thank you for spending time with us.
[1:58:11.080 --> 1:58:13.240]  Say hi to Carol and the rest of the family.
[1:58:13.240 --> 1:58:18.280]  Have a great 4th of July because on this special holiday, we'll be thinking about you and you
[1:58:18.280 --> 1:58:20.840]  certainly deserve some time off, God bless you, sir.
[1:58:20.840 --> 1:58:21.840]  Thank you very much.
[1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:22.840]  Bye-bye.
[1:58:22.840 --> 1:58:25.440]  There goes Congressman Ron Paul, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:58:25.440 --> 1:58:26.440]  Stay with us.
[1:58:26.440 --> 1:58:27.440]  You know who's straight ahead?
[1:58:27.440 --> 1:58:28.440]  You'll find out.
[1:58:28.440 --> 1:58:29.440]  You are listening to GCN.
[1:58:29.440 --> 1:58:30.440]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:30.440 --> 1:58:31.440]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[1:58:31.440 --> 1:58:32.440]  I've come with a message of information.
[1:58:32.440 --> 1:58:33.440]  9-11 was an inside job.
[1:58:33.440 --> 1:58:49.440]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:58:49.440 --> 1:58:51.440]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:58:51.440 --> 1:58:54.240]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[1:58:54.240 --> 1:58:59.440]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF, or the
[1:58:59.440 --> 1:59:07.440]  National Assembly?
[1:59:07.440 --> 1:59:12.440]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[1:59:12.440 --> 1:59:13.440]  to grow at our own door.
[1:59:13.440 --> 1:59:16.440]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:59:16.440 --> 1:59:17.440]  An inside job?
[1:59:17.440 --> 1:59:18.440]  How dare you?
[1:59:18.440 --> 1:59:23.440]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:59:23.440 --> 1:59:30.440]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:59:30.440 --> 1:59:37.440]  Truth, rise, download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:59:37.440 --> 2:00:04.440]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[2:00:04.440 --> 2:00:09.440]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:09.440 --> 2:00:16.440]  Well, we're going into the point that you lie anniversary with quite a bang.
[2:00:16.440 --> 2:00:23.440]  We had Major General Stubblebine on with us with Dr. LeBeau in the first hour, into the
[2:00:23.440 --> 2:00:24.440]  second.
[2:00:24.440 --> 2:00:26.440]  Congressman Ron Paul for a half hour.
[2:00:26.440 --> 2:00:32.440]  And now we're going to have David Eich for an hour and a half or maybe longer coming up
[2:00:32.440 --> 2:00:34.440]  in the next segment.
[2:00:34.440 --> 2:00:40.440]  Quite an interesting interview that that should be and we'll be talking to David Eich in just
[2:00:40.440 --> 2:00:41.440]  a few minutes.
[2:00:41.440 --> 2:00:48.440]  I do want to again encourage all listeners to know that I generally do this within game.
[2:00:48.440 --> 2:00:55.440]  What about six o'clock central, eight months ago, on the day it came out, I released it
[2:00:55.440 --> 2:00:56.440]  the day before.
[2:00:56.440 --> 2:00:59.440]  About six hours before it was supposed to come out.
[2:00:59.440 --> 2:01:02.440]  Now, the main reason I do that is to tweak any servers or make sure it screams to you
[2:01:02.440 --> 2:01:04.440]  quickly with high quality or downloads.
[2:01:04.440 --> 2:01:07.440]  Well, on the big CDNs, we've got super high quality.
[2:01:07.440 --> 2:01:08.440]  It's incredible.
[2:01:08.440 --> 2:01:09.440]  So that's my main reason.
[2:01:09.440 --> 2:01:12.440]  But I'm letting you, the loyal listeners, those that happen to be tuned in right now,
[2:01:12.440 --> 2:01:16.440]  who are prisonplanet.tv members, that you'll be able to see it first.
[2:01:16.440 --> 2:01:18.440]  Kind of get that sneak peek.
[2:01:18.440 --> 2:01:21.440]  It's a cinema verite, which means cinema truth in French.
[2:01:21.440 --> 2:01:26.440]  The cinema of truth is the literal translation and no voiceover, no nothing.
[2:01:26.440 --> 2:01:28.440]  It's the history of the 9-11 truth movement.
[2:01:28.440 --> 2:01:33.440]  What's happened to the first responders, the key info that it was an inside job, and
[2:01:33.440 --> 2:01:39.440]  really a testament to people standing up and it's meant to spread the revolution.
[2:01:39.440 --> 2:01:44.440]  I can think of no better way to spend your July 4th or the eve of July 4th than watching
[2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:45.440]  it in super high quality.
[2:01:45.440 --> 2:01:49.440]  I mean, you can blow up these computer feeds on the big screen TV we were doing yesterday
[2:01:49.440 --> 2:01:54.440]  on a big plasma 40-something miniature in the office, and it was crystal clear.
[2:01:54.440 --> 2:01:57.440]  I mean, in the super high quality versions.
[2:01:57.440 --> 2:01:59.440]  Just absolutely amazing.

[2:02:32.440 --> 2:02:34.440]  I want you to make copies.
[2:02:34.440 --> 2:02:38.440]  Iconoblue, I had seen these in a few offices over the years.
[2:02:38.440 --> 2:02:42.440]  It takes the water out of the air, then it sends it through five filters.
[2:02:42.440 --> 2:02:45.440]  And I just want you to find out about it.

[2:04:04.440 --> 2:04:07.440]  So many other good guys and bad guys.
[2:04:07.440 --> 2:04:09.440]  There's four different sets of them.
[2:04:09.440 --> 2:04:12.440]  They're beautifully done, handcrafted.
[2:04:12.440 --> 2:04:16.440]  And you definitely want to check them out at NWO Trading Cards.

[2:04:21.440 --> 2:04:24.440]  There are currently 42 cards in the series with more in production.
[2:04:24.440 --> 2:04:28.440]  Some cards are rare, presenting a valuable collection.
[2:04:28.440 --> 2:04:32.440]  And they're all made right here in the United States.
[2:04:32.440 --> 2:04:34.440]  www.nwotradingcards.com.
[2:04:34.440 --> 2:04:38.440]  The man, the myth, the legend, he is one of the best public speakers I've ever seen in a great mind.
[2:04:38.440 --> 2:04:41.440]  And so much of what he said has turned out to be true.
[2:04:41.440 --> 2:04:45.440]  I really respect him and apologize for mean things I said about him eight years ago.
[2:04:45.440 --> 2:04:47.440]  He's David Ike when we get back.
[2:04:47.440 --> 2:04:49.440]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[2:04:49.440 --> 2:04:53.440]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[2:04:53.440 --> 2:04:55.440]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[2:04:55.440 --> 2:04:58.440]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:04:58.440 --> 2:05:04.440]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[2:05:04.440 --> 2:05:08.440]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:05:08.440 --> 2:05:13.440]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[2:05:48.440 --> 2:05:56.440]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[2:05:56.440 --> 2:06:00.440]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[2:06:00.440 --> 2:06:04.440]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.

[2:06:47.440 --> 2:06:53.440]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy and weight gain,
[2:06:53.440 --> 2:06:57.440]  I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet, but it just seems so difficult.
[2:06:57.440 --> 2:07:02.440]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer from SnyderHealth.com
[2:07:02.440 --> 2:07:07.440]  and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[2:07:07.440 --> 2:07:10.440]  Drinking water? No, that's something I can handle.
[2:07:10.440 --> 2:07:16.440]  The guys at SnyderHealth took the time to explain all of the different options and helped me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[2:07:16.440 --> 2:07:20.440]  I use my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking.
[2:07:20.440 --> 2:07:26.440]  And since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone, and I already lost seven pounds,
[2:07:26.440 --> 2:07:28.440]  and my skin looks great.
[2:07:28.440 --> 2:07:35.440]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508 to find out which ionizer is right for you.

[2:08:18.440 --> 2:08:22.440]  David Eichel will be with us into the middle of the next hour.
[2:08:22.440 --> 2:08:27.440]  He really doesn't need any introduction, and I'm very pleased that he'll spend time with us today.
[2:08:27.440 --> 2:08:31.440]  He's very busy. He's running for parliament right now.
[2:08:31.440 --> 2:08:35.440]  He has been the head of the Green Party previously in England.
[2:08:35.440 --> 2:08:40.440]  He, of course, is a championship goalie in the big international league.
[2:08:40.440 --> 2:08:46.440]  He also, of course, was a big presenter, one of the top presenters on the sports, on BBC.
[2:08:46.440 --> 2:08:51.440]  What a life he has led, and he is the author of scores of best-selling books.
[2:08:51.440 --> 2:08:57.440]  I agree with about 99% of what David Eichel has to say, and now I've got to sometimes say,
[2:08:57.440 --> 2:09:00.440]  as weird as things are, who knows the other 1% might be right.
[2:09:00.440 --> 2:09:05.440]  I mean, we're on a planet hurtling through space, and God only knows, and so I really respect him.
[2:09:05.440 --> 2:09:10.440]  I appreciate him, and he's just a great speaker and a very interesting mind, riveting individual.
[2:09:10.440 --> 2:09:16.440]  He wants to first talk about this election, and then I want to get into where he sees things going in the next few years.
[2:09:16.440 --> 2:09:19.440]  He's made predictions before, and they've come true, unfortunately.
[2:09:19.440 --> 2:09:24.440]  What he's forecasting in the next 5 to 10 years, what he's forecasting in the short term with Iran,
[2:09:24.440 --> 2:09:31.440]  how he thinks this is going to play out with the forces of good and evil, where he thinks mankind is going.
[2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:36.440]  We're going to have a conversation with David Eichel and, of course, his websites, DavidEichel.com, he has many others,
[2:09:36.440 --> 2:09:41.440]  and we have links to those up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:43.440]  David Eichel, thank you for spending time with us.
[2:09:43.440 --> 2:09:44.440]  Pleasure, Alex.
[2:09:44.440 --> 2:09:47.440]  You've got the floor. Talk about whatever you'd like, sir.
[2:09:47.440 --> 2:09:55.440]  Well, it's kind of interesting. Just in the last hour, I'm looking at some of the things that are happening around me here.
[2:09:55.440 --> 2:10:01.440]  What happened was that a guy called David Davis, who's a Conservative Member of Parliament,
[2:10:01.440 --> 2:10:08.440]  they're in the opposition here to the Labour government, he was the Home Affairs spokesman.
[2:10:08.440 --> 2:10:16.440]  And when the Labour government forced through with outrageous manipulation, a law a few weeks ago,
[2:10:16.440 --> 2:10:26.440]  to allow, quote, terrorist suspects, in other words, once we've got it in the people, to be held for 42 days without charge,
[2:10:26.440 --> 2:10:35.440]  he suddenly resigned and said that he was going to resign his seat and he was going to stand again in his constituency
[2:10:35.440 --> 2:10:43.440]  and seek reelection on the issue, totally one issue of the Big Brother State in Britain.
[2:10:43.440 --> 2:10:49.440]  Yeah, he said that the police state and the cameras was to oppress, that the government was out of control, unprecedented.
[2:10:49.440 --> 2:10:57.440]  Yeah, and it was unprecedented from whichever angle you look at it, this man doing this.
[2:10:57.440 --> 2:11:06.440]  And obviously you put him on the back burner and you see how this plays out, this guy David Davis.
[2:11:06.440 --> 2:11:12.440]  Anyway, I'm watching the news one night, a couple of weeks ago.
[2:11:12.440 --> 2:11:21.440]  And it's clear that the Labour Party is not going to put up a candidate against him because they say the election is a farce.
[2:11:21.440 --> 2:11:27.440]  For that, put it through the translation decoder, we would get slaughtered and is our excuse not to.
[2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:34.440]  The other major party in Britain, the Liberal Democrats, are not standing against him because they say they agree with what he's doing.
[2:11:34.440 --> 2:11:38.440]  And so basically he's on his own. So I thought, well, okay, I'll stand.
[2:11:38.440 --> 2:11:47.440]  I'll stand for two reasons. One, to have a debate with him about the Big Brother State and two, to point out, and this is the major point,
[2:11:47.440 --> 2:11:55.440]  but it is not just the arrogant authoritarian Labour government in this country that's bringing in the Big Brother State.
[2:11:55.440 --> 2:12:01.440]  It's global and it doesn't just include surveillance cameras and DNA databases.
[2:12:01.440 --> 2:12:09.440]  It's a whole tapestry of interconnected change, everything from the European Union to the war on terror.
[2:12:09.440 --> 2:12:11.440]  We'll take Texas and other states.
[2:12:11.440 --> 2:12:15.440]  They're passing laws that the computer repair man, by the way, he's not paid by the government to do this,
[2:12:15.440 --> 2:12:21.440]  must snoop through your computer and have a law enforcement degree to repair computers,
[2:12:21.440 --> 2:12:24.440]  not even a pretense of a Fourth Amendment or privacy.
[2:12:24.440 --> 2:12:31.440]  They're training all the children publicly in the U.S. and in England now to spy on their parents.
[2:12:31.440 --> 2:12:34.440]  I mean, it's like everything has gone into warp drive.
[2:12:34.440 --> 2:12:46.440]  Exactly, it has. And the point I've been making, and since I started to decide to stand, was this very point.
[2:12:46.440 --> 2:12:51.440]  It's happening in every country. So how on earth can it just be the Labour government?
[2:12:51.440 --> 2:12:55.440]  And the reason I'm standing here... Well, the programs even have the same names.
[2:12:55.440 --> 2:13:02.440]  Exactly. So I'm standing here to use the platform and get what mainstream media coverage I can,
[2:13:02.440 --> 2:13:06.440]  as they cover these things like by elections, to get this point across.
[2:13:06.440 --> 2:13:10.440]  And I'm going on the line, Big Brother, the big picture.
[2:13:10.440 --> 2:13:19.440]  But what then starts to emerge is that people that are coming up to this constituency to support David Davis
[2:13:19.440 --> 2:13:25.440]  and are on his website, yeah, he's coming up to support me in opposing Big Brother.
[2:13:25.440 --> 2:13:28.440]  Well, there are some very strange bedfellows this guy's got.
[2:13:28.440 --> 2:13:35.440]  First of all, there's a guy coming up here called Ed Vasey, MP, to oppose the Big Brother state.
[2:13:35.440 --> 2:13:43.440]  Well, hold on a second. He was one of the original signatories to something called the Henry Jackson Society.
[2:13:43.440 --> 2:13:51.440]  He started in 2005, named after a former U.S. senator. And then I look at the members of the Henry Jackson Society.
[2:13:51.440 --> 2:13:59.440]  First of all, Sir Richard Dearloft, head of MI6 from 1990-2004, Erwin Stelzer,
[2:13:59.440 --> 2:14:04.440]  former managing director of the Rothschilds Bank, now living in London, U.S. Economist,
[2:14:04.440 --> 2:14:08.440]  a contributor to the weekly standard, of course, Murdoch's neocon rags.
[2:14:08.440 --> 2:14:14.440]  So they're trying to co-opt the Revolution against tyranny. They know they can't stop it, so they're trying to preempt it.
[2:14:14.440 --> 2:14:16.440]  So you're preempting, they're preempting.
[2:14:16.440 --> 2:14:23.440]  Well, yeah, it's becoming clear what this scam here that I'm in the middle of here is about now,
[2:14:23.440 --> 2:14:29.440]  because he was also a resident scholar of the American Enterprise Institute,
[2:14:29.440 --> 2:14:35.440]  and now he's with the Hudson Institute. Of course, now we're starting to talk major neocon organizations
[2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:40.440]  that were orchestrators and propagandists for the war on terror, but it goes further.
[2:14:40.440 --> 2:14:48.440]  International patrons for the Henry Jackson Society of this guy who's coming to support David Davis against Big Brother
[2:14:48.440 --> 2:14:53.440]  include Richard Pearl, one of the major architects of the invention.
[2:14:53.440 --> 2:14:54.440]  The Prince of Darkness.
[2:14:54.440 --> 2:15:00.440]  The Prince of Darkness, William Crystal, co-founder of the project for the New American Century.
[2:15:00.440 --> 2:15:04.440]  James Woolsey, former head of the CIA and neocon.
[2:15:04.440 --> 2:15:07.440]  All the head neocons you just listed.
[2:15:07.440 --> 2:15:15.440]  Another international patron, Robert Kagan, co-founder of the project for the New American Century with William Crystal.
[2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:23.440]  Senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which is the re-committee in the 50s with Norman Dodd,
[2:15:23.440 --> 2:15:26.440]  found out was actually manipulating war.
[2:15:26.440 --> 2:15:33.440]  He's the senior speechwriter for George Schultz, one of the major manipulators behind the scenes in the United States
[2:15:33.440 --> 2:15:34.440]  when he was Secretary of State.
[2:15:34.440 --> 2:15:36.440]  He's still top king, Megger, yes.
[2:15:36.440 --> 2:15:47.440]  Yeah, these are the people who are connected to this organization and this guy, Ed Vasey, who's coming up to support David Davis to fight Big Brother.
[2:15:47.440 --> 2:15:51.440]  And there's another guy coming up called Patrick Mercer MP.
[2:15:51.440 --> 2:15:59.440]  He's a consultant for something called Blue Hackle, which is a security firm akin to Blackwater, that kind of operation.
[2:15:59.440 --> 2:16:06.440]  Now, Private Merce, let me stop you, David, because a lot of Americans, people in the U.S. don't know the British nomenclature for elections.
[2:16:06.440 --> 2:16:09.440]  By standing, that means you're running for his seat.
[2:16:09.440 --> 2:16:14.440]  He's pulling back in his stunt to claim he's running from outside to come in and fix things.
[2:16:14.440 --> 2:16:18.440]  And it's not like he's just signed on to a group that has some neocons on it.
[2:16:18.440 --> 2:16:22.440]  They're coming to his district to push and campaign for him.
[2:16:22.440 --> 2:16:24.440]  That's what you mean by coming up.
[2:16:24.440 --> 2:16:27.440]  Yeah, coming up to this constituency where I'm sitting in the middle right now.
[2:16:27.440 --> 2:16:33.440]  The neocons are actively flocking in to this area of England to push this guy actively.
[2:16:33.440 --> 2:16:34.440]  Go ahead.
[2:16:34.440 --> 2:16:39.440]  Exactly. Patrick Mercer MP is also sponsored by something called the Heart Group.
[2:16:39.440 --> 2:16:47.440]  Now, this is a guy, just to confirm again, who's coming up to support the challenge to Big Brother.
[2:16:47.440 --> 2:16:56.440]  Well, this Heart Group that sponsors this Patrick Mercer produces electronic passports, border control systems for security, vehicle registration and tracking,
[2:16:56.440 --> 2:17:00.440]  biometric identification systems, et cetera, et cetera.
[2:17:00.440 --> 2:17:10.440]  And it's very clear that, you know what it's like, Alex, if you have an awareness starting to express itself,
[2:17:10.440 --> 2:17:16.440]  an understanding of some of what's going on, you want to put your people in there to become the focus
[2:17:16.440 --> 2:17:21.440]  and therefore control and direct or misdirect that gathering awareness.
[2:17:21.440 --> 2:17:27.440]  And more and more, it's clear as I'm up here going through this election,
[2:17:27.440 --> 2:17:29.440]  which I don't want to win, of course.
[2:17:29.440 --> 2:17:31.440]  I wasted time going to Parliament.
[2:17:31.440 --> 2:17:32.440]  But you have to, David.
[2:17:32.440 --> 2:17:33.440]  I mean, you have to win.
[2:17:33.440 --> 2:17:34.440]  No, I don't want to win.
[2:17:34.440 --> 2:17:39.440]  I don't want to win because what it will do is catch me in the web,
[2:17:39.440 --> 2:17:43.440]  which will stop me doing all the other things that I need to do that are far more important.
[2:17:43.440 --> 2:17:45.440]  I understand, but have you calculated?
[2:17:45.440 --> 2:17:49.440]  I mean, is this going to hurt who he's running against more than it hurts him?
[2:17:49.440 --> 2:17:52.440]  He'll win easily.
[2:17:52.440 --> 2:17:54.440]  But you're just educating people.
[2:17:54.440 --> 2:17:55.440]  But to be clear...
[2:17:55.440 --> 2:17:56.440]  Exactly.
[2:17:56.440 --> 2:17:57.440]  That's why I'm standing here.
[2:17:57.440 --> 2:17:58.440]  I'm standing to get this information out.
[2:17:58.440 --> 2:17:59.440]  I mean, do you agree?
[2:17:59.440 --> 2:18:00.440]  This is what he'll do then.
[2:18:00.440 --> 2:18:03.440]  He'll say, look, I'm against Big Brother.
[2:18:03.440 --> 2:18:06.440]  What we need is this, and it'll be worse Big Brother,
[2:18:06.440 --> 2:18:10.440]  but they'll label that as anti-Big Brother, and then he'll be the savior
[2:18:10.440 --> 2:18:13.440]  and only give you the good ID cards that are safe.
[2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:16.440]  Yeah, and the other thing that's happening, and it's already happened,
[2:18:16.440 --> 2:18:22.440]  is because he's done this, he's now the man the British media go to,
[2:18:22.440 --> 2:18:24.440]  if ever a Big Brother-type story breaks.
[2:18:24.440 --> 2:18:26.440]  Let's get a comment from David Davis.
[2:18:26.440 --> 2:18:30.440]  So he becomes like the standard bearer.
[2:18:30.440 --> 2:18:31.440]  He's the man.
[2:18:31.440 --> 2:18:39.440]  And of course, they need people like that to misdirect this gathering awareness.
[2:18:39.440 --> 2:18:43.440]  And the awareness is not only coming from shows like you and people like me.
[2:18:43.440 --> 2:18:45.440]  It's coming from daily experience, of course, now.
[2:18:45.440 --> 2:18:52.440]  And they need to find a way of directing it away from seeing the real,
[2:18:52.440 --> 2:18:59.440]  massive connections that show this is a global, not a national issue.
[2:18:59.440 --> 2:19:00.440]  So he is.
[2:19:00.440 --> 2:19:02.440]  And that's why I'm standing to get this information across.
[2:19:02.440 --> 2:19:07.440]  By the way, Alex, he stood and said, I want to debate on Big Brother.
[2:19:07.440 --> 2:19:08.440]  That's why I'm doing it.
[2:19:08.440 --> 2:19:14.440]  He has absolutely point blank refused to debate with me, a fellow candidate in this election.
[2:19:14.440 --> 2:19:15.440]  Amazing.
[2:19:15.440 --> 2:19:20.440]  So bottom line, he is a change agent masquerading as the alternative.
[2:19:20.440 --> 2:19:22.440]  He is controlled opposition.
[2:19:22.440 --> 2:19:25.440]  There's a very good chance that that is what this game is about.
[2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:28.440]  Well, there's no doubt if you've got every top neocon,
[2:19:28.440 --> 2:19:32.440]  the inner circle of global neocon power coming to his district,
[2:19:32.440 --> 2:19:36.440]  the campaign for him because he's fighting the New World Order.
[2:19:36.440 --> 2:19:37.440]  I mean, this is incredibly obvious.
[2:19:37.440 --> 2:19:41.440]  We're going to do a behind the scenes discussion for prisonplanet.tv and internet.
[2:19:41.440 --> 2:19:44.440]  The listeners right now will be back for everybody else in just a few minutes.
[2:19:44.440 --> 2:19:45.440]  Stay with us.
[2:19:45.440 --> 2:19:46.440]  David I.
[2:19:46.440 --> 2:19:52.440]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[2:19:52.440 --> 2:19:55.440]  I went to grounds here and we knew what to do.
[2:19:55.440 --> 2:19:57.440]  Or at least we thought we did.
[2:19:57.440 --> 2:20:04.440]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[2:20:04.440 --> 2:20:12.440]  Then EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:20:12.440 --> 2:20:20.440]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[2:20:20.440 --> 2:20:23.440]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[2:20:23.440 --> 2:20:29.440]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:20:29.440 --> 2:20:54.440]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[2:20:54.440 --> 2:21:02.440]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[2:21:02.440 --> 2:21:08.440]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt,
[2:21:08.440 --> 2:21:10.440]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[2:21:10.440 --> 2:21:15.440]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[2:21:15.440 --> 2:21:20.440]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[2:21:20.440 --> 2:21:24.440]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[2:21:24.440 --> 2:21:30.440]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[2:21:30.440 --> 2:21:35.440]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[2:21:35.440 --> 2:21:38.440]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[2:21:38.440 --> 2:21:46.440]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[2:21:46.440 --> 2:21:56.440]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're going to start taking this hemp, I say. Go to hempusa.org.
[2:21:56.440 --> 2:22:01.440]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm going to say it anyway.
[2:22:01.440 --> 2:22:06.440]  The government doesn't want the best for you. They keep you down. They keep you blue.
[2:22:06.440 --> 2:22:11.440]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[2:22:11.440 --> 2:22:20.440]  It won't let you grow industrial hemp. It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[2:22:20.440 --> 2:22:30.440]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song for the heart of America wants this one. Go to hempusa.org.
[2:22:30.440 --> 2:22:39.440]  If you're a true Thurian anarchist or renegade, you only want things that God has made. Go to hempusa.org.
[2:22:39.440 --> 2:22:46.440]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states. Go to hempusa.org.
[2:22:46.440 --> 2:22:55.440]  Have you heard about American Free Press? American Free Press, the only national newspaper that endorsed Ron Paul for president.
[2:22:55.440 --> 2:23:03.440]  American Free Press, written by patriots, for patriots. Standing firm for our Constitution.
[2:23:03.440 --> 2:23:11.440]  Standing firm against the New World Order. Hammering the enemies of freedom. Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.
[2:23:11.440 --> 2:23:19.440]  American Free Press hits the Bilderbergers and trilateralists, and the whole council on foreign relations gang head on.
[2:23:19.440 --> 2:23:23.440]  Here's your chance to catch up with the news from American Free Press.

[2:23:29.440 --> 2:23:37.440]  This is simple. AmericanFreePress.net. It's just like it sounds. AmericanFreePress, all one word,.net.
[2:23:37.440 --> 2:23:59.440]  Once again, that's AmericanFreePress.net. American Free Press, the voice of the Second American Revolution.
[2:23:59.440 --> 2:24:07.440]  All right, folks listening on InfoWars.com and watching on PrisonPlanet.tv to search David, totally switch into left, right brain science.
[2:24:07.440 --> 2:24:14.440]  Restate that without me interrupting David. Break down the left, right, and I've read the research. You're absolutely accurate in what you're saying for people.
[2:24:14.440 --> 2:24:19.440]  And how this Illuminati pyramid goes after certain compartmentalized, shuttered individuals.
[2:24:19.440 --> 2:24:32.440]  You'll talk to globalists and you'll find out they're compartmentalized and have been selected because like a specialized insect in an anthill, they carry out a specific function, which is totally left brain.
[2:24:32.440 --> 2:24:40.440]  Once I began to understand how the brain worked, society started to make real sense to me because we have two hemispheres of the brain.
[2:24:40.440 --> 2:24:45.440]  There's the right brain, which is the creative. It's the out there. It's the maverick. It's the free thinking.
[2:24:45.440 --> 2:24:56.440]  It's that which will not be imprisoned. It's that which can see connections between things and not just see everything as divided and apart.
[2:24:56.440 --> 2:25:04.440]  Now the left brain, the left brain really helps us function in this world because it's about language. It's about structure.
[2:25:04.440 --> 2:25:16.440]  And it's about the world of the five senses, if you like. And it's important. We need whole brain people because if you're only right brain, we all know people like that.
[2:25:16.440 --> 2:25:27.440]  They're very creative, but they can't function in this world. But there's another extreme, which is becoming a left brain prisoner, which I have to say is where most people are, particularly those who run the system.
[2:25:27.440 --> 2:25:40.440]  And if you're in the left brain, you're just dealing with five sense reality, which is a fraction of what there is to understand and certainly a fraction of what there is to express yourself.
[2:25:40.440 --> 2:25:52.440]  And the system is designed to lock people in that tiny left brain reality and they do it, not least through the bravely entitled education system.
[2:25:52.440 --> 2:26:01.440]  Because as you go through school, what are you doing? You're taking in left brain information, hold it, and now give it me back on an exam paper.
[2:26:01.440 --> 2:26:07.440]  Tell the system what it's told you and then you progress because you're very successful at school.
[2:26:07.440 --> 2:26:09.440]  That's basic programming.
[2:26:09.440 --> 2:26:17.440]  Programming. Yes, it is. I mean, it's interesting, you know, Alex, that when you go through a secret society, you go up through degrees.
[2:26:17.440 --> 2:26:23.440]  And then when you, you know, you go to university, you get a degree. Well, it's a degree of programming to a very large extent.
[2:26:23.440 --> 2:26:31.440]  So you go to university from school, you go through the same process of taking in left brain information and putting it out on an exam paper.
[2:26:31.440 --> 2:26:40.440]  You then choose your specialization of medicine, whatever it is, science, law, all of these things.
[2:26:40.440 --> 2:26:46.440]  And then you go through your specialization and to pass those exams, you do the same again.
[2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:57.440]  So what you've been doing all your formative life is working with left brain reality and building up the left brain to dominate your sense of reality.
[2:26:57.440 --> 2:27:07.440]  And it's these people who end up in the positions of power at the top of all the institutions of science and law and politics and even business.
[2:27:07.440 --> 2:27:20.440]  And so the system is run by left brain prisoners who are operating with a fraction of their potential of understanding reality and creativity.
[2:27:20.440 --> 2:27:32.440]  And therefore we live in a left brain society. And it's interesting. Again, you know, when you understand these things, you start to see the significance of apparently things that are not connected.
[2:27:32.440 --> 2:27:48.440]  The British government a few months ago announced that it was going to introduce 500 tests, intellectual type tests, for preschool children.
[2:27:48.440 --> 2:27:59.440]  And the teachers were saying, hold on a minute, when are the kids going to have time to play? They don't want them to play because playing is an ad-lib, imagine a right brain thing.
[2:27:59.440 --> 2:28:06.440]  Here in the US, I don't know about England, they have been on dodgeball, then it was play, then it was tag. Now they're just getting rid of recess.
[2:28:06.440 --> 2:28:13.440]  And again, they want to keep you in that left brain as the Prussians discovered over 100 years ago.
[2:28:13.440 --> 2:28:21.440]  Their own documents, as you know, David, I'm sure you've seen them, say that they don't ever want you to relax or have time to think or daydream or have a philosophic.
[2:28:21.440 --> 2:28:27.440]  It's all just machines compartmentalizing the mind with the seven periods.
[2:28:27.440 --> 2:28:33.440]  That's absolutely right. Daydreaming is a very, very important point. Daydreaming is a right brain kind of activity.
[2:28:33.440 --> 2:28:40.440]  Well, it's also a communion between the cerebral cortex of the left and right and the subconscious, which is the larger, more powerful system.
[2:28:40.440 --> 2:28:51.440]  Yeah, so what they want to do is lock people into a left brain reality because it's basically putting them into a reality bubble, what I call the eggshell.
[2:28:51.440 --> 2:28:59.440]  And when I went to Oxford University, of course, if you're very, very good at this left brain, give it me and I'll give it you back on an exam paper,
[2:28:59.440 --> 2:29:08.440]  you are considered in this left brain bewildered world to be a kind of intellectual genius.
[2:29:08.440 --> 2:29:13.440]  These are the people who are professors at universities who are teaching the next generation.
[2:29:13.440 --> 2:29:23.440]  And when I went to talk at Oxford University, it was extraordinary the concrete minds that you see who are perceived by society to be...
[2:29:23.440 --> 2:29:28.440]  David Ike, we've got a break. Stay there. Stay there. Three minute break. We'll be right back. Get into this.
[2:29:28.440 --> 2:29:37.440]  Then get into the big picture of the end game with David Ike. I'm Alex Jones, PrismPlanet.com. Stay with us.
[2:29:37.440 --> 2:29:47.440]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:47.440 --> 2:29:58.440]  Life has changed. We're not 21 anymore. We have responsibilities. That's why there's drinking made hangover defense.
[2:29:58.440 --> 2:30:01.440]  Sure, we've done our share of partying. Yeah, dude.
[2:30:01.440 --> 2:30:11.440]  Kicking back with the neighbors and a few beers is more our style. But let's face it, as we get older, even that can leave us feeling run down the next morning.
[2:30:11.440 --> 2:30:16.440]  With drinking mate, you can have a few drinks tonight without waking up feeling like you had a few.
[2:30:16.440 --> 2:30:24.440]  Drinking mate's patented and proven formula of guava leaf extract has antioxidants and other unique properties that help prevent the headache,
[2:30:24.440 --> 2:30:33.440]  a lazy stomach, and dehydration even a few drinks can leave behind. Just dissolve one drinking mate in water and take it before bed. It's that easy.
[2:30:33.440 --> 2:30:37.440]  The next morning, bring on the responsibilities.
[2:30:37.440 --> 2:30:47.440]  Drinking made hangover defense is available at retailers nationwide. Pick up some today. Remember your drinking mate and wake up feeling great.
[2:30:47.440 --> 2:30:56.440]  It's a big idea. A New World Order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:30:56.440 --> 2:31:01.440]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:31:01.440 --> 2:31:15.440]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:31:15.440 --> 2:31:24.440]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:31:24.440 --> 2:31:27.440]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:31:27.440 --> 2:31:32.440]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their after easy.

[2:33:10.440 --> 2:33:14.440]  DavidIke.com. This is Google's name.
[2:33:14.440 --> 2:33:38.440]  Before we get back into these educated idiots or insects, highly specialized individuals who are only in their little discipline and fit nicely into the New World Order Illuminati power pyramid into their place for the Master Queen B up at the top, you've got a lot of websites, a lot of books, a lot of videos.
[2:33:38.440 --> 2:33:43.440]  Tell folks where they should go to find out more about those books and videos and materials.
[2:33:43.440 --> 2:33:46.440]  DavidIke.com is the center.
[2:33:46.440 --> 2:33:52.440]  Really Alex, so if people go there, they'll get all of them.
[2:33:52.440 --> 2:34:09.440]  I've written about 16 books overall and it's been a journey, like it has for you. It's been a journey of seeing that something wasn't right and then as you keep walking, the path just gets bigger and the information gets bigger and the picture gets bigger.
[2:34:09.440 --> 2:34:19.440]  We've reached this point today where we now at last are going to get some kind of real fix on the scale of this and therefore we have a chance of turning it around.
[2:34:19.440 --> 2:34:29.440]  Sure. Let's go ahead and get back and finish up your story about talking to just the general public, much more open-minded, much more intelligent, just on the facts.
[2:34:29.440 --> 2:34:38.440]  People who know about the New World Order are really into info, wide-ranging analysis of different disciplines versus the specialized New World Order menus.
[2:34:38.440 --> 2:34:51.440]  What we've got to do, Alex, is we've got to reevaluate our understanding of intelligence. Cleverness is not wisdom and cleverness without wisdom is the most destructive force on Earth.
[2:34:51.440 --> 2:35:01.440]  What happens with left-brain-dominated cleverness in terms of technology and stuff like that?
[2:35:01.440 --> 2:35:06.440]  David, let me stop you. I think the cord to your phone may be loose because we're losing your audio. Can you check that?
[2:35:06.440 --> 2:35:10.440]  Yeah. It's a hotel phone. I should complain.
[2:35:10.440 --> 2:35:14.440]  I would imagine that you're walking around and when it's time.
[2:35:14.440 --> 2:35:19.440]  No, I'm sitting perfectly still. I'm coming and going.
[2:35:19.440 --> 2:35:29.440]  Start over. Go back to what you were saying. When you have these individuals, you were saying cleverness is not wisdom.
[2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:42.440]  Cleverness without wisdom is the most destructive force on Earth because without the balance of wisdom, cleverness can just go wild and create infinite death and destruction.
[2:35:42.440 --> 2:35:50.440]  It's very, very clever to know how to create an atomic bomb, but it's not wise to do so, especially not to use it.
[2:35:50.440 --> 2:36:01.440]  We've got these left-brain prisoners running the system who are clever, but they don't have the balance of wisdom.
[2:36:01.440 --> 2:36:13.440]  Intelligence is not just being able to remember what size shoes the Normans took in the Battle of Hastings in 1066.
[2:36:13.440 --> 2:36:22.440]  It's being able to see things that less intelligent people can't see. I'll give you an example of the difference.
[2:36:22.440 --> 2:36:34.440]  I spoke at the Brixton Academy in London to two and a half thousand people about a month ago, and in that audience was every race, every income bracket,
[2:36:34.440 --> 2:36:46.440]  every range of society aged a lot, and I gave them everything I could give them because the reason they were there is they had open-minded intelligence.
[2:36:46.440 --> 2:36:53.440]  But when I spoke to these, quote, brilliant students at Oxford University, I'm sitting in the hotel room in the afternoon thinking,
[2:36:53.440 --> 2:37:04.440]  how do I put this in baby steps so these people have any chance of getting it? It's because we have misunderstood what intelligence is,
[2:37:04.440 --> 2:37:12.440]  and intelligence is just not just academia as we perceive it. It's the wisdom to see things, to see the connections things.
[2:37:12.440 --> 2:37:14.440]  It locks into intuition.
[2:37:14.440 --> 2:37:19.440]  Let me bring forward an example of what I think of as wisdom.
[2:37:19.440 --> 2:37:28.440]  Exactly. They can come up with a GMO food that makes some huge profits and corners the market on food, and that would be clever.
[2:37:28.440 --> 2:37:32.440]  But did they with wisdom think about what that will even do to their own grandchildren?
[2:37:32.440 --> 2:37:44.440]  No. These clever, wicked people, they just do it because they can in this mad, almost instinctive race to have power to dominate, to control the rationale is,
[2:37:44.440 --> 2:37:53.440]  well, if I don't do it, somebody else will, but also wisdom really is about being tied into the human journey, the human species,
[2:37:53.440 --> 2:37:57.440]  realizing we're all connected and not being selfish.
[2:37:57.440 --> 2:38:05.440]  I mean, they're clever to have power, but they're also blinded in that they think they really are disconnected from the rest of reality
[2:38:05.440 --> 2:38:12.440]  when really, when some soldier rapes and kills a child, they're raping and killing their own soul.
[2:38:12.440 --> 2:38:23.440]  Exactly. And Einstein said that you cannot solve problems with the same level of consciousness.
[2:38:23.440 --> 2:38:32.440]  David, I got to stop you again. Can you wiggle that cord? David, stop. I need you to wiggle that cord in that phone, or we may have to reconnect with you.
[2:38:32.440 --> 2:38:38.440]  I'll tell you what, when we have a break, I'll try the other phone on the other side of the room.
[2:38:38.440 --> 2:38:45.440]  That's what we'll do. That's perfect. We'll call you on the other phone. Okay, you're back now. I can barely hear you say Einstein.
[2:38:45.440 --> 2:38:52.440]  Yeah. What I'm saying is that Einstein said that you cannot solve problems with the same level of consciousness that created them,
[2:38:52.440 --> 2:39:00.440]  and that's what we're constantly trying to do, and that's why, you know, you replace a government with another party,
[2:39:00.440 --> 2:39:08.440]  but that party, be it Democrat or Republican, Labor or Conservative, is coming in with the same level of consciousness,
[2:39:08.440 --> 2:39:12.440]  i.e. the political system's consciousness, as the one it's replacing.
[2:39:12.440 --> 2:39:20.440]  So instead of solving problems, it just creates more, and we're at a point now where we need to move to another level of consciousness
[2:39:20.440 --> 2:39:26.440]  and overwhelmingly, it's just again connected to getting out of the left brain dominated reality
[2:39:26.440 --> 2:39:34.440]  so that we can see how we're creating these problems, because if you're at the same level of consciousness that created them,
[2:39:34.440 --> 2:39:38.440]  you can't see how the problems are being created. So you just go round and round and round.
[2:39:38.440 --> 2:39:44.440]  And what's happening is more and more people who haven't necessarily been through the education system
[2:39:44.440 --> 2:39:50.440]  and got degrees and bits of paper and letters after their name, they're opening to a level of consciousness
[2:39:50.440 --> 2:39:58.440]  which is higher than that which created the problems, and therefore, they can start to see ways out of here.
[2:39:58.440 --> 2:40:04.440]  Now, I want to shift gears into currently what's happening with Iran and why the globalists are devaluing the dollar,
[2:40:04.440 --> 2:40:10.440]  why they're preparing to bring us into a world crisis as the springboard to the next level,
[2:40:10.440 --> 2:40:18.440]  what things will look like if the Aluminist and their controllers are able to build their world.
[2:40:18.440 --> 2:40:28.440]  So seeing it from their perspective, their view, what they want, this cold-blooded view, versus what freedom and love and liberty
[2:40:28.440 --> 2:40:36.440]  and the human revolution. We see these two different revolutions, the tyrants' revolution for global domination,
[2:40:36.440 --> 2:40:43.440]  to have the final revolution of total dehumanization, global extermination of 90% of the world's population,
[2:40:43.440 --> 2:40:51.440]  versus this, for every action there's an equal reaction, we see a rising up against that.
[2:40:51.440 --> 2:40:59.440]  So as they intensify their juggernaut, their control system, as they throw more coal in the engine and accelerate towards Armageddon,
[2:40:59.440 --> 2:41:08.440]  we see another massive force of love and liberty and decency and honor and wisdom rising up against it.
[2:41:08.440 --> 2:41:13.440]  Yeah, it's like the irresistible force against the immovable object,
[2:41:13.440 --> 2:41:21.440]  because the immovable object, basically themselves, are this network of control and enslavement.
[2:41:21.440 --> 2:41:29.440]  But it's a house of cards. I've been saying this for years. It's a house of cards because we are holding it together.
[2:41:29.440 --> 2:41:37.440]  This is the key point we have to understand. I've been saying in this election campaign, just bringing it down to a basic level,
[2:41:37.440 --> 2:41:46.440]  that we've had people in this country find hundreds of pounds for putting their wheelie trash bin out on the wrong day,
[2:41:46.440 --> 2:41:49.440]  according to the council's days, that says they should put it out.
[2:41:49.440 --> 2:41:55.440]  And they spy on your trash. We have to start saying, no, I'm not going to go along with this. Go ahead.
[2:41:55.440 --> 2:42:05.440]  We had a guy in the last week here who was fined 100 pounds by a council for putting a card in his own car,
[2:42:05.440 --> 2:42:14.440]  saying it was for sale. He was charged with trading in the street because he parked it somewhere to go to a shop.
[2:42:14.440 --> 2:42:21.440]  Now, if we just allow that to happen and say, oh, that's terrible, isn't it ridiculous? What's the world coming to?
[2:42:21.440 --> 2:42:28.440]  Then we're going to walk straight into this prison cell that we can't see the bubble.
[2:42:28.440 --> 2:42:32.440]  Most people can't see the bars other than they're beginning to, and the door's going to click shut,
[2:42:32.440 --> 2:42:37.440]  and then we're going to say, oh, hold on a second, we're in a cell. What do we do? Well, it's going to be a bit bloody late then.
[2:42:37.440 --> 2:42:48.440]  What we need to do now is to have a nonviolent, absolutely nonviolent, noncooperation campaign with the system that's enslaving us.
[2:42:48.440 --> 2:42:54.440]  You know, if someone's fine for putting a wheelie bin out on the wrong day, then hundreds and thousands of people
[2:42:54.440 --> 2:42:58.440]  need to put their wheelie bin out on the wrong day indefinitely until the laws change.
[2:42:58.440 --> 2:43:03.440]  People need to go around with cars in their cars with adverts on until the laws change.
[2:43:03.440 --> 2:43:07.440]  This is the only way we're going to do it because politicians aren't going to change it.
[2:43:07.440 --> 2:43:10.440]  Politicians are told how to vote because they want to progress in the party.
[2:43:10.440 --> 2:43:15.440]  No, they've got the big fake tanks in the party heads. Managed them. I wanted to bring this up.
[2:43:15.440 --> 2:43:21.440]  Two years ago, I was in England, two and a half years ago, right after London bombing, Fort Terror stormed my film,
[2:43:21.440 --> 2:43:28.440]  and the police, when I was being quiet, I'd be standing there videotaping somewhere in London or outside London,
[2:43:28.440 --> 2:43:33.440]  and cops would walk over and say, I'm putting you in a database. You're not allowed to videotape in this country.
[2:43:33.440 --> 2:43:38.440]  I'd be talking to crowds of people. They'd walk over and say, you're not allowed to talk to people,
[2:43:38.440 --> 2:43:43.440]  and it was before they banned protest around Parliament. It was about a week later they did,
[2:43:43.440 --> 2:43:46.440]  and they just said, we don't care. You're not allowed to be here. No law.
[2:43:46.440 --> 2:43:52.440]  And now they're even coming up to mainline reporters, and how did they get these police, these bobbies,
[2:43:52.440 --> 2:43:58.440]  to, with pleasure, come over, and now it's in the British news. They harass everyone, even mainline reporters.
[2:43:58.440 --> 2:44:05.440]  They tell people don't talk to others in the streets. I mean, this is worse than East Germany, and it just happened overnight, David.
[2:44:05.440 --> 2:44:12.440]  Yeah, well, I had, shall we say, an animated discussion with some policemen when I was filming a television program.
[2:44:12.440 --> 2:44:16.440]  They, they, I was in Parliament, and they came over to me and said, excuse me, have you got permission?
[2:44:16.440 --> 2:44:21.440]  I said, what permission? I said, I pay taxes to pay for this place. And they said, oh, well, we have to come over,
[2:44:21.440 --> 2:44:25.440]  because we've got cameras all around Parliament Square, so we had to come over and see what you were doing.
[2:44:25.440 --> 2:44:31.440]  I said, well, you've got cameras all over Parliament Square. Look at your screens, and you'll see, go away.
[2:44:31.440 --> 2:44:37.440]  And this has happened very quickly, and there's something going on. You know, you know,
[2:44:37.440 --> 2:44:46.440]  over the years, this rabbit hole has got deeper, the picture's got bigger, and there's something Alex to do with the way they are manipulating
[2:44:46.440 --> 2:44:54.440]  the consciousness of people who are, if you like, operating at a certain level of frequency.
[2:44:54.440 --> 2:45:03.440]  You know, the brain is an electromagnetic electrical operation. It's like a computer, like the whole body's like a computer.
[2:45:03.440 --> 2:45:09.440]  Electrochemical. Yeah, electrochemical and electromagnetic. It's all to do with that stuff.
[2:45:09.440 --> 2:45:17.440]  And if you can access the body computer, as I call it, at the frequency levels it operates at, with the means,
[2:45:17.440 --> 2:45:25.440]  the electromagnetic, electrical, chemical means that it operates in, then you can start changing the way that people,
[2:45:25.440 --> 2:45:30.440]  operating at that frequency that you're manipulating at, think, feel, and everything.
[2:45:30.440 --> 2:45:34.440]  Now, this is an interesting point, a really interesting point that you've raised here,
[2:45:34.440 --> 2:45:40.440]  because I've been walking around and seeing this for many, many months now.
[2:45:40.440 --> 2:45:51.440]  There has been a consciousness change, Alex, very demonstrably among council officials, government officials, people in uniform.
[2:45:51.440 --> 2:45:59.440]  No doubt about it, they've become more efficient, they've become more robotic in the sense that they can't assess a situation on its merits.
[2:45:59.440 --> 2:46:03.440]  It's the law, mate, so I've got to do this and all this stuff.
[2:46:03.440 --> 2:46:10.440]  You can tell me about America, but in this country, I've demonstrably seen it in the last year or so.
[2:46:10.440 --> 2:46:21.440]  This has got more and more blatant and obvious, where you literally, mate, talking to robots who cannot function in assessing a situation
[2:46:21.440 --> 2:46:27.440]  and reacting to it, they have to approach every situation the same. It's extraordinary.
[2:46:27.440 --> 2:46:34.440]  It's like I got an email a few days ago, which I posted on my website, which is a classic case.
[2:46:34.440 --> 2:46:42.440]  A parent has just sat her little child, having an ice cream on the side of this little fountain,
[2:46:42.440 --> 2:46:45.440]  no danger whatsoever in a public place.
[2:46:45.440 --> 2:46:50.440]  We've now got safety police in this country who came over and said,
[2:46:50.440 --> 2:46:55.440]  well, you've got to take your child off that wall because it's dangerous, which it wasn't.
[2:46:55.440 --> 2:46:57.440]  So this is now coming into the...
[2:46:57.440 --> 2:47:05.440]  Well, they're getting you trained to be minded, to have secret police talking to you, to have them asking what you're doing,
[2:47:05.440 --> 2:47:08.440]  putting you in files, controlling you.
[2:47:08.440 --> 2:47:14.440]  They're getting normal people who wouldn't have connections to the system and the police, they're training you.
[2:47:14.440 --> 2:47:17.440]  They admit the public schools here are prisons.
[2:47:17.440 --> 2:47:24.440]  We have government documents to indoctrinate you to be institutionalized on drugs for criminal reasons, psychological reasons.
[2:47:24.440 --> 2:47:27.440]  It's all an induction into the system.
[2:47:27.440 --> 2:47:32.440]  And of course, in England and in the U.S., they're now saying, you'll have to have a license to have a child.
[2:47:32.440 --> 2:47:35.440]  If you hug or kiss your child in public, you'll be arrested.
[2:47:35.440 --> 2:47:43.440]  You've got to have certification cards by the Safety Bureau to hug your child or to change their own diaper.
[2:47:43.440 --> 2:47:47.440]  Again, this is the state openly destroying the parents, taking the children.
[2:47:47.440 --> 2:47:49.440]  They're making their move right now.
[2:47:49.440 --> 2:47:54.440]  Yeah, this is how one major level of what's going on, Alex, in my view.
[2:47:54.440 --> 2:48:04.440]  You know when they put rats or mice in these laboratory mazes and if they go down certain channels in the maze, they get an electrical shock.
[2:48:04.440 --> 2:48:09.440]  After a while, the mouse has had so many electric shocks going down.
[2:48:09.440 --> 2:48:11.440]  It stops going down there.
[2:48:11.440 --> 2:48:14.440]  Now, you can take the electric shock technology away.
[2:48:14.440 --> 2:48:18.440]  That mouse will not go down that channel anymore because it's been shocked so much.
[2:48:18.440 --> 2:48:26.440]  Now, when you look at the number of times, and my goodness me, it's expanding so fast that we're told what we can do, what we shouldn't do,
[2:48:26.440 --> 2:48:29.440]  we're threatened with prosecution, we'll be fined if you do this.
[2:48:29.440 --> 2:48:38.440]  Basically, what this is, it's a massive war on the human mind and the human consciousness and human emotion.
[2:48:38.440 --> 2:48:45.440]  Basically, to become subservient, it's a massive version of anything for a quiet life.
[2:48:45.440 --> 2:48:50.440]  And the more we acquiesce, the more they pile on.
[2:48:50.440 --> 2:49:01.440]  Yeah, because what they're building is a society in which for the vast, vast majority, they don't have to do anything to keep people in line
[2:49:01.440 --> 2:49:06.440]  because they'll keep people in line like the rat or the mouse in the maze.
[2:49:06.440 --> 2:49:13.440]  It's the 200-year-old French system of making people think they're surveilled and then they enforce on themselves.
[2:49:13.440 --> 2:49:16.440]  Yeah, and this brings me to another point.
[2:49:16.440 --> 2:49:27.440]  All this surveillance and the tracking and the databases and all this stuff, this is not for the vast majority of people on this planet
[2:49:27.440 --> 2:49:39.440]  because the vast majority of people will fall into that category whereby they will acquiesce through fear or through subservient programming
[2:49:39.440 --> 2:49:45.440]  that we've been talking about. All this stuff is for those that don't buy it, that don't fall for it,
[2:49:45.440 --> 2:49:49.440]  that hold their own mind and their own consciousness and their own reality.
[2:49:49.440 --> 2:49:54.440]  What might be called collectively the dissidents of the system, that's what that's for.
[2:49:54.440 --> 2:49:59.440]  To keep track and keep control of them because these guys are terrified of Mavericks.
[2:49:59.440 --> 2:50:02.440]  They're terrified of people who aren't terrified of them.
[2:50:02.440 --> 2:50:13.440]  This is what it's really targeting because most people, as in all worlds, 1984, most of the people weren't a problem to Big Brother.
[2:50:13.440 --> 2:50:18.440]  It was the dissidents that Big Brother had the control systems in for.
[2:50:18.440 --> 2:50:22.440]  Okay, we're going to go to break for the main network, but David, we're going to talk behind the scenes.
[2:50:22.440 --> 2:50:25.440]  Your phone's fine now so we don't have to switch over.
[2:50:25.440 --> 2:50:33.440]  Stay right there. We're going to talk behind the scenes with the Prison Planet TV viewers and the folks listening to the exclusive streams at infowars.com.
[2:50:33.440 --> 2:50:36.440]  Everybody else will be right back in just three minutes.
[2:50:36.440 --> 2:50:41.440]  If you want to hear this, go to the infowars.com exclusive streams or prisonplanet.com streams.
[2:50:41.440 --> 2:51:06.440]  We'll be right back.
[2:51:13.440 --> 2:51:19.440]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:51:19.440 --> 2:51:26.440]  An inside job? How dare you?
[2:51:26.440 --> 2:51:30.440]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:51:30.440 --> 2:51:33.440]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:51:33.440 --> 2:51:38.440]  The government has not told the truth. In five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of life.
[2:51:38.440 --> 2:51:44.440]  Since rise, download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:51:44.440 --> 2:51:47.440]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[2:51:47.440 --> 2:51:49.440]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[2:51:49.440 --> 2:51:55.440]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[2:51:55.440 --> 2:51:56.440]  But the symptoms are there.
[2:51:56.440 --> 2:52:04.440]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[2:52:04.440 --> 2:52:10.440]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[2:52:10.440 --> 2:52:14.440]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[2:52:14.440 --> 2:52:19.440]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[2:52:19.440 --> 2:52:21.440]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:52:21.440 --> 2:52:29.440]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[2:53:54.440 --> 2:54:01.440]  Okay, David and I were just talking about how we want to share knowledge, we want to learn more, we want to celebrate knowledge.
[2:54:01.440 --> 2:54:10.440]  The elite ported control it. The universities, the military industrial complex, 90 plus percent of university research.
[2:54:10.440 --> 2:54:16.440]  It's all compartmentalized and then sent up to the architects to control it and manipulate it.
[2:54:16.440 --> 2:54:18.440]  And David was just now talking about that.
[2:54:18.440 --> 2:54:22.440]  Then when we start the next hour, for 45 minutes, he's going to spend with us.
[2:54:22.440 --> 2:54:29.440]  He's going to get into the master plan, what they want to build, what their end game is, and how we can stop them.
[2:54:29.440 --> 2:54:35.440]  I finished up with what you were just talking about, how they hoard knowledge, how it's the ultimate selfishness.
[2:54:35.440 --> 2:54:43.440]  Yeah, knowledge is something that sets people free because the more you know, the more potential you have to control your own life,
[2:54:43.440 --> 2:54:47.440]  to understand your own world, to understand your own reality.
[2:54:47.440 --> 2:54:52.440]  And so what they've done over the centuries is two things.
[2:54:52.440 --> 2:54:58.440]  They've hoarded the advanced knowledge, the real understanding of the nature of reality.
[2:54:58.440 --> 2:55:06.440]  Like, for instance, at the so-called cutting edge of science, I'm banging this table now and it seems solid,
[2:55:06.440 --> 2:55:10.440]  but quantum physicists know that that table is made of atoms.
[2:55:10.440 --> 2:55:13.440]  Atoms have no solidity and therefore it can't actually be solid.
[2:55:13.440 --> 2:55:17.440]  So why does it appear to be solid? Why do we experience it as solid?
[2:55:17.440 --> 2:55:27.440]  And it's a mystery, but at the top levels of this secret society web, this knowledge of reality and how we are influenced by it,
[2:55:27.440 --> 2:55:30.440]  is known, and if you have that knowledge...
[2:55:30.440 --> 2:55:33.440]  Well, we're at a molecular level that resonates with that table.
[2:55:33.440 --> 2:55:38.440]  Yeah, and exactly, we're within its frequency range, but we're decoding it.
[2:55:38.440 --> 2:55:42.440]  We live, the more I understand about this, Alex, we live in...
[2:55:42.440 --> 2:55:46.440]  Our brain sits in the fourth dimension, which the scientific equations show.
[2:55:46.440 --> 2:55:50.440]  I mean, our thoughts are more than even four-dimensional.
[2:55:50.440 --> 2:55:55.440]  Yeah, we live in what I call the holographic internet.
[2:55:55.440 --> 2:56:01.440]  I'm sitting in a room now and this hotel has the wireless internet.
[2:56:01.440 --> 2:56:07.440]  I can't see it. It's in the invisible realms beyond the frequency of visible light,
[2:56:07.440 --> 2:56:10.440]  which is the only frequency range that my eyes can access.
[2:56:10.440 --> 2:56:16.440]  However, if I put my computer on out of nowhere, out of the ether,
[2:56:16.440 --> 2:56:25.440]  I can bring that internet into reality on the screen as pictures, as graphics, as text, as websites.
[2:56:25.440 --> 2:56:28.440]  And if you say to someone, tell me about the internet.
[2:56:28.440 --> 2:56:31.440]  Oh, they'll say it's websites and it's on the screen and all that.
[2:56:31.440 --> 2:56:36.440]  Yeah, but the only place the internet exists in that form is on the computer screen,
[2:56:36.440 --> 2:56:40.440]  everywhere else, it's electronic circuits and on-off electrical pulses.
[2:56:40.440 --> 2:56:42.440]  People say, tell me about television.
[2:56:42.440 --> 2:56:46.440]  No, it's programs and moving pictures on a screen. Hold on a second.
[2:56:46.440 --> 2:56:49.440]  The only place television exists in that form is on the screen, everywhere else.
[2:56:49.440 --> 2:56:52.440]  It's frequency fields and electronic circuits.
[2:56:52.440 --> 2:56:58.440]  And then it interfaces with your eyes, which are brain stocks, which then decoded in their own system,
[2:56:58.440 --> 2:57:03.440]  and that are then interpreted by the deeper centers of the mind.
[2:57:03.440 --> 2:57:06.440]  Yeah, we are like receiver transport.
[2:57:06.440 --> 2:57:11.440]  Never mind, we're like. We are at the level of the body, receiver transmitters of information.
[2:57:11.440 --> 2:57:16.440]  From a quote matrix, which it operates just like the wireless internet.
[2:57:16.440 --> 2:57:23.440]  And we are decoding it through the mind, through the various parts of the brain,
[2:57:23.440 --> 2:57:31.440]  into a holographic, non-physical, but serve very much experiences like that world,
[2:57:31.440 --> 2:57:36.440]  which doesn't actually exist outside of ourselves, although it seems to be like that.
[2:57:36.440 --> 2:57:41.440]  It exists in our own minds. It's quite rightly said. We don't see with our eyes.
[2:57:41.440 --> 2:57:44.440]  We see with our brain, because that's what decodes information.
[2:57:44.440 --> 2:57:51.440]  And the top admin, let us in on this when they say, perception is reality.
[2:57:51.440 --> 2:57:57.440]  It is. And if I had to bring this down to the most foundation form,
[2:57:57.440 --> 2:58:03.440]  this whole conspiracy that plays out as banking scams and political scams
[2:58:03.440 --> 2:58:07.440]  and all the things that you deal with and I deal with, but at its foundation,
[2:58:07.440 --> 2:58:13.440]  it is the manipulation of our reality and our sense of reality.
[2:58:13.440 --> 2:58:21.440]  And it's more than this. In China, you can only access parts of the internet.
[2:58:21.440 --> 2:58:26.440]  Stay there, stay there. David, you've got to break back in 70 seconds with the fourth hour.

[2:59:56.440 --> 2:59:59.440]  David Eich is our guest for another 45 minutes.
[2:59:59.440 --> 3:00:05.440]  At the bottom of the hour, I will take about five, six phone calls for David, specifically for David.
[3:00:05.440 --> 3:00:14.440]  On any question that you have, 1-800-259-9231, it is July 3rd, 2008.
[3:00:14.440 --> 3:00:17.440]  Jason Burmans will be sitting in for me live tomorrow.
[3:00:17.440 --> 3:00:23.440]  Coming out this evening, we're going to release on the web a few hours early at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:00:23.440 --> 3:00:25.440]  My new film, Truth Rising.
[3:00:25.440 --> 3:00:32.440]  And we're very, very excited as it energizes the population to go out there and take on the New World Order
[3:00:32.440 --> 3:00:39.440]  people outside their comfort zones, outside the sheep zone to tell the system we're not going along with it peacefully.
[3:00:39.440 --> 3:00:41.440]  David Eich, again, our amazing guest.
[3:00:41.440 --> 3:00:48.440]  You were talking about how they limit the perception of reality, how they keep us here just looking at, you know, the materialistic plane
[3:00:48.440 --> 3:00:50.440]  when humans are obviously so much more.
[3:00:50.440 --> 3:00:54.440]  And you were talking about China, which limits large areas of the internet.
[3:00:54.440 --> 3:01:01.440]  Now we're seeing that in Europe, England, and the U.S. companies, corporations, universities, internet too.
[3:01:01.440 --> 3:01:03.440]  They're now doing that. You've gotten up to that point.
[3:01:03.440 --> 3:01:14.440]  Yeah, the reason I raised the point about the Chinese internet is because it's so relevant to the way our reality is manipulated.
[3:01:14.440 --> 3:01:20.440]  In China, you can only get so much of the internet because it's firewalled off.
[3:01:20.440 --> 3:01:28.440]  And those computers in that country cannot access, cannot decode the internet in those areas firewalled off.
[3:01:28.440 --> 3:01:43.440]  Now, what they've been doing and what they're really ratcheting up now is to firewall off our body computer's ability to access a much greater range of reality.
[3:01:43.440 --> 3:01:53.440]  Even within this holographic internet, this matrix, whatever you want to call it, they are firewalling us off from great chunks of it
[3:01:53.440 --> 3:01:59.440]  and being able to access knowledge, understanding it, and what have you from it.
[3:01:59.440 --> 3:02:04.440]  And what they are doing are destabilizing the body computer.
[3:02:04.440 --> 3:02:07.440]  Now the body computer works electrically and it works chemically.
[3:02:07.440 --> 3:02:19.440]  When it is in chemical and electrical balance, we are at our sharpest and we are fully potentialed transmitter receivers of information.
[3:02:19.440 --> 3:02:26.440]  But you add sodium fluoride, mercury in the shots, booze, drugs, all of it, it clouds it.
[3:02:26.440 --> 3:02:33.440]  And then you add the electronic frequency pollution, you add the TV, you add all these flickering distractions.
[3:02:33.440 --> 3:02:38.440]  I mean, they admit, first time you watch TV, 45 minutes, then you're mesmerized, dream level.
[3:02:38.440 --> 3:02:44.440]  And then the next time it's 10 minutes, next time it's 30 seconds, people are literally mesmerized to go ahead.
[3:02:44.440 --> 3:02:54.440]  Exactly. What they're doing is destabilizing the body computer so it becomes an inefficient transmitter receiver of information.
[3:02:54.440 --> 3:03:02.440]  And so the band, the range of the reality that we are accessing gets smaller and smaller.
[3:03:02.440 --> 3:03:05.440]  It's interesting, you know, what do we say about people with closed minds?
[3:03:05.440 --> 3:03:13.440]  We say they're narrow-minded. I would say they're narrow-banded because they're accessing just a minute amount.
[3:03:13.440 --> 3:03:17.440]  And they tend, and when you shut down, you tend to get smaller and smaller.
[3:03:17.440 --> 3:03:21.440]  When you open up, your band tends to get bigger and bigger. Here are the studies.
[3:03:21.440 --> 3:03:27.440]  They'll have an 85-year-old, 97-year-old in one case. I've seen the autopsy reports in studies.
[3:03:27.440 --> 3:03:33.440]  My dad years ago showed these to me. Some composer who was speaking five languages, totally happy till the day they died.
[3:03:33.440 --> 3:03:36.440]  They cut open their brain cap, tiny brain, but they were a genius.
[3:03:36.440 --> 3:03:39.440]  Then they'll cut open some 70-year-old who died of Alzheimer's.
[3:03:39.440 --> 3:03:46.440]  Big brain hadn't had a lot of tissue loss, but they were basically retarded when they died and they're always TV heads.
[3:03:46.440 --> 3:03:53.440]  And they have all the studies that show TV is causing Alzheimer's along with a cocktail of other things because they weren't stimulating the mind.
[3:03:53.440 --> 3:03:56.440]  It was only one way information.
[3:03:56.440 --> 3:04:01.440]  Yeah, I mean, you know, as the saying goes, Alex, size is not everything.
[3:04:01.440 --> 3:04:08.440]  And it's certainly not that with the brain. It's how efficient it is, how sharp it is, how its electrical and chemical systems are working.
[3:04:08.440 --> 3:04:15.440]  And the more you stimulate it, the more you stimulate and hone and sharpen those systems.
[3:04:15.440 --> 3:04:23.440]  So when you have the dumbing down, not just of America, but of country after country now, it's like a muscle.
[3:04:23.440 --> 3:04:29.440]  If you don't use it, then it starts to go to sleep. It starts to get flabby. It stops working properly.
[3:04:29.440 --> 3:04:37.440]  And you go into a smaller and smaller range of reality, which means that you cannot make the connections.
[3:04:37.440 --> 3:04:40.440]  You cannot connect the dots. You cannot see what is...
[3:04:40.440 --> 3:04:43.440]  Hold on one moment. We've got a break.
[3:04:43.440 --> 3:04:45.440]  We've got a break.

[3:06:43.440 --> 3:06:53.440]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[3:06:53.440 --> 3:07:00.440]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:07:00.440 --> 3:07:09.440]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:07:09.440 --> 3:07:16.440]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth, as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:07:16.440 --> 3:07:25.440]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown. He takes his hand off in a year, three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:07:25.440 --> 3:07:34.440]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.

[3:07:44.440 --> 3:07:53.440]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:07:53.440 --> 3:08:14.440]  Wow, David Icke is talking about how, in the behind-the-scenes from prisonplanet.tv viewers, he is talking about how the people that are going along with the system, the government people, the police, those that are in those closed-down cult-like cultures with all the peer pressure, they are closing down right now.
[3:08:14.440 --> 3:08:27.440]  You can see the myopic almost drooling. I mean, you talk people now and either they're getting more closed-down, I mean, literally like retarded, or they're opening up and energizing and more intuitive.
[3:08:27.440 --> 3:08:36.440]  And I just, I dream of giving them knowledge. I dream of seeing them energized. I dream of seeing them seeing what I see, knowing what I know, and even more.
[3:08:36.440 --> 3:08:48.440]  And I just want to untie that, unloose it, and then I see the New World Order, which I can see more and more clearly now. I can see their designs, their master plans, not just from their own documents, but I can see the manifestation.
[3:08:48.440 --> 3:09:01.440]  I can predict what they're going to do down to the exact words, blowing people away. And as the real world is clear and clear to me, it's a little frightening as I see David Icke's world's pretty clear, actually.
[3:09:01.440 --> 3:09:13.440]  Then it horrifies me to see these stunted creatures. It's almost like in colors. There's these rainbow, happy, glowing light, you know, people waking up, shining brighter.
[3:09:13.440 --> 3:09:20.440]  And then there's these dark, like, black holes of people who are getting more and more evil, more and more hateful, more and more greedy and petty.
[3:09:20.440 --> 3:09:26.440]  And I see a huge war right now, that war against the people unlocking their minds. David Icke.
[3:09:26.440 --> 3:09:39.440]  Yeah, you know, when I go back to the days, nearly 20 years ago, when I was just minding my own business, introducing television programs, and suddenly the top of my head blew off.
[3:09:39.440 --> 3:09:47.440]  And for about three months, which is very much remembered by people in this country, for about three months, if you'd asked my name, I wouldn't have better tell you.
[3:09:47.440 --> 3:10:08.440]  If you'd asked me what planet I was on, I'd have to check. But what happened in that period, it was like my mind opened so fast for whatever reason that all this knowledge that my mind and my brain did not have to decode before.
[3:10:08.440 --> 3:10:14.440]  Suddenly, it was decoding this massive amount of information that was coming into my mind.
[3:10:14.440 --> 3:10:24.440]  What happened to me for about three months was like, when you press too many keys on the computer too quick, it freezes up and it goes, can't process this, shutting down, go away.
[3:10:24.440 --> 3:10:40.440]  And then after about three months, after mass ridicule, because of what had gone on, my mind morphed, it was like the computer unfroze, and suddenly I could see the same world in a completely different way.
[3:10:40.440 --> 3:10:49.440]  Now, David, let me ask you a question, because I don't know a lot of people that have this similar experience. I have that, but every six months, every year, it might be two times in a week, like levels.
[3:10:49.440 --> 3:11:06.440]  And then the problem is the level I'm on, I can't even articulate to people, so it's very frustrating that I can't even, because it's like, I'm at the Grand Canyon on business, and I call my wife, and she says, what's it look like to describe it?
[3:11:06.440 --> 3:11:10.440]  There's no describing it. It's too big. There's too much.
[3:11:10.440 --> 3:11:30.440]  Do you know, I tell you what, mate, the biggest frustration of my life in the last 20 years has been being in that situation since that awakening, and people perceiving you as mad, as ridiculous, as far out, as dangerous, all these things.
[3:11:30.440 --> 3:11:49.440]  And you knew that you just couldn't explain where you were coming from fully, because you couldn't find the words to do it, because what you were knowing and what you were feeling, we have simply, because we've been closed out for so long, we've not developed even the human language to express it.
[3:11:49.440 --> 3:12:09.440]  And what's the real joy to me now? I mean, I could start crying, to be honest, as you bring this subject up. What's the real joy to me is that more and more minds are opening to, so we can now have a dialogue, and people can understand other people, and where they're coming from, and where they've been.
[3:12:09.440 --> 3:12:14.440]  And so there is this massive parting of the ways, if you like.
[3:12:14.440 --> 3:12:23.440]  And that's got the New World Order upset. I mean, I'm not seeing arrogance anymore. They are acting like they are scared to death, like kryptonite or something.
[3:12:23.440 --> 3:12:37.440]  Well, it's interesting, Alex, you know, I've been saying for years now that this panic, and that's what it is, this mad panic to bring in this Orwellian state is not even to advance their power.
[3:12:37.440 --> 3:12:51.440]  Hold on to the power that already accumulated, because I was going to say in those early years when my mind whacked open, I knew that there was a vibrational change coming.
[3:12:51.440 --> 3:13:01.440]  That's why I called the first book I ever wrote on these subjects back in 1990, Truth Vibrations. There was a vibrational change coming that was going to open people up.
[3:13:01.440 --> 3:13:20.440]  It was going to act like a spiritual alarm clock for those who were open to it, and that this network of control, which is a fear network, they're terrified of each other, and you're quite right, they are terrified of an awakened humanity.
[3:13:20.440 --> 3:13:32.440]  The way they control humanity is not because they're more intelligent or more wise, but because they put humanity by manipulation in a smaller box than they're in.
[3:13:32.440 --> 3:13:38.440]  We're sleeping, they live. I mean, that's the movie they live. You know, we sleep, they live. They're living.
[3:13:38.440 --> 3:13:50.440]  They live that, you know, John Carpenter movie was so accurate in so many ways about the way this system works. And that's their big joke. The general public isn't living. We're awake. We're living. We're just on the good guy's side.
[3:13:50.440 --> 3:14:05.440]  They're awake. They're on the dark side. Yeah, and what they're terrified of, and this is why I said earlier, all this surveillance and stuff and all this data and all this tracking stuff, it's not for the mass of the population.
[3:14:05.440 --> 3:14:14.440]  It's for those who are awakened because they knew, and I knew nearly 20 years ago, but who could I discuss this with?
[3:14:14.440 --> 3:14:24.440]  I knew 20 years ago that this stuff was coming in because they knew that the awakening was coming, and they had to try to keep the trapdoor on it.
[3:14:24.440 --> 3:14:38.440]  And this is why it's in this period we've had the massive influx of chemicals in food, electromagnetic pollution, which is designed to manipulate the energy field that we live in, and the fields we live in.
[3:14:38.440 --> 3:14:48.440]  Yeah, all that stuff, it's designed to target those who have the potential to awaken. They're intelligent about those people.
[3:14:48.440 --> 3:15:02.440]  They report that the magnetic field of the earth energized by the sun and space radiation, and this is mainstream science, is what plants and plankton and bacteria and the whole time clocks on, not just the light, but the magnetic field.
[3:15:02.440 --> 3:15:14.440]  And then I had to head a harp on last week, and he was admitting they create artificial aurora borealis, but then he said cell phones and wavelengths and radio waves, none of them are bad for us.
[3:15:14.440 --> 3:15:18.440]  When mainline science admits it'll fry you, I mean, it's just...
[3:15:18.440 --> 3:15:20.440]  No, the man's either an idiot or a liar.
[3:15:20.440 --> 3:15:22.440]  No, he's the top scientist ahead of them.
[3:15:22.440 --> 3:15:35.440]  Oh, jeez. But it's a nonsense. I said to someone a few weeks ago, how do you affect all the fish at the same time? And sir, you affect the sea. You change the sea, you affect every fish.
[3:15:35.440 --> 3:15:41.440]  You change the sea of energy that we live in, which is what harp and all these other things are about, you affect everybody.
[3:15:41.440 --> 3:15:50.440]  Well, I've got hundreds of studies, and obviously you know this, but I'm backing up, David, that just cell towers and things, and they always argue, well, the sun puts off a lot of this.
[3:15:50.440 --> 3:15:59.440]  Well, we're designed and created to live with its waves. You add all these other ones, that's what causes that butterfly effect.
[3:15:59.440 --> 3:16:08.440]  Yeah, but this is the key point, and I think it brings into some perspective what we've been talking about with this parting of the waves.
[3:16:08.440 --> 3:16:20.440]  If everything is about frequency, these are quite obviously the cell phones work on a frequency.
[3:16:20.440 --> 3:16:23.440]  All these things that are being poured out as work on a frequency.
[3:16:23.440 --> 3:16:30.440]  Even a chemical additive in a soft drink or whatever is a frequency on an energetic level.
[3:16:30.440 --> 3:16:41.440]  Once you open your mind, open your heart, which is connected to the mind energetically, and you raise to a higher frequency,
[3:16:41.440 --> 3:16:50.440]  then just like radio A doesn't affect radio B because it's on the different frequency, so these things stop affecting us.
[3:16:50.440 --> 3:17:00.440]  The ones, and this I think is very significant to what we've been talking about, the ones who are not opening up, who are on that frequency,
[3:17:00.440 --> 3:17:09.440]  which they're targeting, they are going to respond more and more in line with that frequency range manipulation,
[3:17:09.440 --> 3:17:15.440]  and so they're going to be more closed, more robotic, whereas other people who are not being affected by that manipulation,
[3:17:15.440 --> 3:17:24.440]  they're out of the vibrational stadium that these people manipulate, they're not going to be affected by it.
[3:17:24.440 --> 3:17:32.440]  And I tell you, Alex, that these people that are behind the New World Order are terrified of an awakening humanity.
[3:17:32.440 --> 3:17:35.440]  It's a mental and spiritual rebellion against tyranny.
[3:17:35.440 --> 3:17:41.440]  Did you see the Baltimore Sun article six years ago where DARPA that invented the net and everything else said,
[3:17:41.440 --> 3:17:48.440]  and we are in the field testing waves and towers to make people relax during emergencies,
[3:17:48.440 --> 3:17:55.440]  and they said, and we have the patents from the 50s, but they were testing us when they just put that in the newspaper.
[3:17:55.440 --> 3:18:02.440]  Well, I think you have something similar in America, but in Britain, the Blair government,
[3:18:02.440 --> 3:18:09.440]  even though we had a perfectly adequate and workable communication system for the emergency services in this country,
[3:18:09.440 --> 3:18:14.440]  suddenly a massive cost changed it to something called the Tetra system,
[3:18:14.440 --> 3:18:20.440]  which they have these towers now all over Britain, and there's more and more all the time.
[3:18:20.440 --> 3:18:21.440]  Same thing here.
[3:18:21.440 --> 3:18:22.440]  Same thing here.
[3:18:22.440 --> 3:18:28.440]  Yeah, and they operate within human brainwave, the range of human brainwaves.
[3:18:28.440 --> 3:18:32.440]  Now, I say to people who say, well, it won't affect us.
[3:18:32.440 --> 3:18:33.440]  Well, hold on a second.
[3:18:33.440 --> 3:18:38.440]  When you go under those great power lines in your car with the radio on,
[3:18:38.440 --> 3:18:39.440]  what happens?
[3:18:39.440 --> 3:18:47.440]  Well, that's what they're doing to our electrical system and balance in the human body and the human brain.
[3:18:47.440 --> 3:18:55.440]  But again, the more we open up, the more we raise the frequency and expand the range that we're accessing,
[3:18:55.440 --> 3:19:00.440]  the more these things that are operating with a certain frequency range are not going to affect us
[3:19:00.440 --> 3:19:04.440]  like they're going to affect people who are still in that frequency range.
[3:19:04.440 --> 3:19:06.440]  But it's still not good for your tissue.
[3:19:06.440 --> 3:19:09.440]  No, it's not. It's not good to have.
[3:19:09.440 --> 3:19:16.440]  But I'm saying that if you're operating within these low emotional and mental states,
[3:19:16.440 --> 3:19:19.440]  then these things are going to affect you so much more powerfully.
[3:19:19.440 --> 3:19:23.440]  David, we're going to talk during this four minute behind the scenes and come back for five minutes
[3:19:23.440 --> 3:19:27.440]  and then take calls, 1-800-25-99-231.
[3:19:27.440 --> 3:19:33.440]  But when we come back, I want you to talk about the stakes of what we face if we don't beat this
[3:19:33.440 --> 3:19:36.440]  or whether you think it's foregone we're going to beat it or foregone we're going to lose
[3:19:36.440 --> 3:19:37.440]  or what their master plan is.
[3:19:37.440 --> 3:19:39.440]  I've got to get that out of you, David, before you leave us.
[3:19:39.440 --> 3:20:05.440]  But right now, we're going to talk more behind the scenes about mind control.
[3:20:12.440 --> 3:20:16.440]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings,
[3:20:16.440 --> 3:20:20.440]  Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[3:20:44.440 --> 3:20:47.440]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[3:20:47.440 --> 3:20:53.440]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[3:20:53.440 --> 3:20:54.440]  That's right.
[3:20:54.440 --> 3:20:58.440]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[3:20:58.440 --> 3:21:04.440]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[3:21:04.440 --> 3:21:10.440]  The truth be told, gold and silver is outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs,
[3:21:10.440 --> 3:21:12.440]  yet no word about IRAs.
[3:21:12.440 --> 3:21:17.440]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[3:21:17.440 --> 3:21:23.440]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[3:21:23.440 --> 3:21:28.440]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[3:21:28.440 --> 3:21:31.440]  Call 800-686-2237.
[3:21:31.440 --> 3:21:34.440]  Make sure that you secure your future.

[3:22:43.440 --> 3:22:49.440]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[3:22:49.440 --> 3:22:54.440]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[3:22:54.440 --> 3:22:59.440]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[3:22:59.440 --> 3:23:03.440]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[3:23:03.440 --> 3:23:11.440]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[3:23:11.440 --> 3:23:17.440]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[3:23:17.440 --> 3:23:23.440]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[3:23:23.440 --> 3:23:29.440]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[3:23:43.440 --> 3:23:53.440]  David Ike was just talking to me behind the scenes here at the Prison Planet on TV about how they're targeting the children.
[3:23:53.440 --> 3:23:59.440]  You go into the store, it says fluoride water for kids, extra fluoride, and the studies admit it's many times worth for children
[3:23:59.440 --> 3:24:08.440]  attacking their cerebral cortex development, their entire brain, 20% IQ reduction, 20-point IQ reduction on average, federal studies.
[3:24:08.440 --> 3:24:16.440]  I mean, the cold bloodedness, they now have the children's textbooks. I've got a bunch of them that say fluoride is one of the main vitamins and minerals you need.
[3:24:16.440 --> 3:24:25.440]  And it says how great it is, the mercury in the shots, the video games that bring you into an oxygen-starved narcosis in unnatural brainwaves
[3:24:25.440 --> 3:24:32.440]  that are only associated with near-death experiences. And David was explaining why they were doing that, David.
[3:24:32.440 --> 3:24:41.440]  Yes, they're targeting the children because, of course, the children of today are going to be around on the law of averages for longer than anyone else.
[3:24:41.440 --> 3:24:51.440]  And so they want to create this long-term Orwellian prison for the young so that by the time they become the adults,
[3:24:51.440 --> 3:24:57.440]  they're fully fledged robots and controlled by the system.
[3:24:57.440 --> 3:25:04.440]  And so it's video games that we were talking about in the break are targeting children overwhelmingly.
[3:25:04.440 --> 3:25:16.440]  The foods and the drinks and the soft drinks that are most appallingly filled with chemicals and toxins and all this stuff are targeting children.
[3:25:16.440 --> 3:25:29.440]  And if you look at the graph of when this stuff started entering into food and drink on a massive scale and the graph of so-called increases in childhood behavior problems,
[3:25:29.440 --> 3:25:39.440]  it's like a magnet holding the graphs together. Why? Because the body is an electrochemical entity and if you destabilize it electrically or chemically,
[3:25:39.440 --> 3:25:48.440]  then you are going to manifest an imbalanced behavior of that body, an imbalanced reaction and imbalanced sense of reality.
[3:25:48.440 --> 3:25:51.440]  Well, listen, what's happening? We're poisoning the kids.
[3:25:51.440 --> 3:25:58.440]  Well, David, it's not your opinion either. We have all the big eugenicists 80 years ago, 100 years ago, it's in my film Endgame.
[3:25:58.440 --> 3:26:03.440]  I mean, they wrote books saying we're going to put mercury in shots to brain damage and put fluoride in.
[3:26:03.440 --> 3:26:09.440]  We're going to feed them poison food to dumb them down. We've isolated the chemicals that will do this.
[3:26:09.440 --> 3:26:17.440]  And it's so cold-blooded. It's so big. The conspiracy is so large and so open that the average person can't come to grips with it, but now they can.
[3:26:17.440 --> 3:26:24.440]  If the New World Order was to have their way, what's the time frame? What are we going to see in the next year, next two years, next 10 years?
[3:26:24.440 --> 3:26:27.440]  What is going to unfold and how do you see us fighting it?
[3:26:27.440 --> 3:26:44.440]  Well, we are now standing at this fork in the road. And I said in a media conference for this by-election yesterday that I'm being very, very optimistic in saying that if we go on as we are,
[3:26:44.440 --> 3:26:54.440]  not sleepwalking into this Orwellian state, but hurtling towards it in a comatose state, then we will live in a global fascist state within 15 years.
[3:26:54.440 --> 3:27:02.440]  And I'm probably being optimistic with the 15. However, at the same time this is happening, this awakening is going on.
[3:27:02.440 --> 3:27:11.440]  Now, I understand why people don't realize the scale of the awakening, because if it's not in the mainstream media, to most people, it doesn't exist.
[3:27:11.440 --> 3:27:23.440]  And for the mainstream media to actually see something that's outside of its tiny, tiny pea-sized bubble that it covers, it has to be 10-foot high with neon lights.
[3:27:23.440 --> 3:27:36.440]  But I can tell you, mate, from traveling to what 45 countries now around the world from the early 1990s, I've seen it in every country.
[3:27:36.440 --> 3:27:45.440]  And it's exponential. And because it doesn't get in the mainstream, the scale of it is not understood. It is enormous.
[3:27:45.440 --> 3:27:49.440]  But it's not just that the mainstream's dumb, they're artificially not reporting on our victories.
[3:27:49.440 --> 3:28:08.440]  Exactly. But the thing is that what we need now to do is to harness this awakening into a unified force, which will cease to cooperate with its own enslavement.
[3:28:08.440 --> 3:28:15.440]  Because this is the key point. When people say, oh, no, they're all powerful, no, they're not all powerful.
[3:28:15.440 --> 3:28:21.440]  The power they use to control us is the power we give away all the time.
[3:28:21.440 --> 3:28:30.440]  Now, if we... I'll tell you a quick story. I had a friend years ago, he was a famous comedian in Britain called Larry Grayson.
[3:28:30.440 --> 3:28:38.440]  And I went to his funeral and another comedian told this story that Larry Grayson had told to him about an experience he had.
[3:28:38.440 --> 3:28:46.440]  And Larry Grayson, in the days of the music hall and stuff like that, the last vestiges of it, he was in this musical show. It was an all-male show.
[3:28:46.440 --> 3:28:55.440]  And he played the woman in it, kind of what he did. And at the end of the show, he said, he dressed up as a Britannia.
[3:28:55.440 --> 3:29:02.440]  And all the men came on dressed as sailors and got on top of each other's shoulders and formed a pyramid appropriately.
[3:29:02.440 --> 3:29:08.440]  And they were doing it to this song, Rule Britannia, and all this rubbish.
[3:29:08.440 --> 3:29:10.440]  Stay there. I want to hear it on the other side.
[3:29:10.440 --> 3:29:11.440]  I'll finish then.
[3:29:11.440 --> 3:29:15.440]  Yeah, we got to finish on the other side of this break. Final segment with David Ige.
[3:29:15.440 --> 3:29:20.440]  Straight ahead, ladies and gentlemen, we're really appreciative of him coming on, whether it's DavidIge.com.
[3:29:20.440 --> 3:29:35.440]  I'm Alex Jones. Truth Rising is going to be released in the next few hours at infowars.com.
[3:29:35.440 --> 3:29:47.440]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:47.440 --> 3:29:55.440]  Once America was led by real politicians, now politicians in the U.S., city, county, state, and federal are owned and controlled by corporations.
[3:29:55.440 --> 3:30:02.440]  We have corporate representatives instead of politicians. Criminal corporate manipulation has caused grain prices to soar to the highest levels in history.
[3:30:02.440 --> 3:30:05.440]  Shortages of rice, corn, and wheat now exist in most countries.
[3:30:05.440 --> 3:30:08.440]  Natural disasters have put millions worldwide at risk of starvation.
[3:30:08.440 --> 3:30:13.440]  Food riots and bread lines occur daily in 30 nations and not only is that list growing, but it's headed this way.
[3:30:13.440 --> 3:30:17.440]  Survival enterprises are massive distributors of the highest quality long-term storage foods.
[3:30:17.440 --> 3:30:22.440]  Mountain House freeze-dried foods, canned beef, chicken, turkey, butter, bacon, spices, cheese, fruit, and more.

[3:31:11.440 --> 3:31:16.440]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:31:16.440 --> 3:31:21.440]  An inside job? How dare you?
[3:31:21.440 --> 3:31:27.440]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:31:27.440 --> 3:31:30.440]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:31:30.440 --> 3:31:35.440]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of...
[3:31:35.440 --> 3:31:36.440]  Truth rising.

[3:33:53.440 --> 3:33:56.440]  Thank you for watching.
[3:33:56.440 --> 3:34:02.360]  it got worse and it cost so much that he could no longer stand in the pyramid and down came
[3:34:02.360 --> 3:34:06.720]  the pyramid and Larry Grayson symbolic of this elite on the top of the pyramid ended
[3:34:06.720 --> 3:34:14.620]  up in row two and all that it had taken was not, you know, someone, you know, fighting
[3:34:14.620 --> 3:34:21.480]  at the top against Britannia symbolically but someone who got a cough and walked away
[3:34:21.480 --> 3:34:25.600]  at the bottom of the pyramid because the bottom of the pyramid holds the top of the pyramid
[3:34:25.600 --> 3:34:30.880]  up there and when we stop cooperating with our own enslavement because there are billions
[3:34:30.880 --> 3:34:36.560]  of us who are being enslaved, there's a handful at the peak of the peak of the peak who are
[3:34:36.560 --> 3:34:42.000]  orchestrating the enslavement in full awareness, it's all over and they know that.
[3:34:42.000 --> 3:34:43.000]  They're terrified.
[3:34:43.000 --> 3:34:44.000]  You know what that is?
[3:34:44.000 --> 3:34:45.880]  That's a true yurtle the turtle story.
[3:34:45.880 --> 3:34:46.880]  Yeah.
[3:34:46.880 --> 3:34:52.560]  You know, do you remember that movie, the bug's life, the animated movie?
[3:34:52.560 --> 3:34:56.840]  And he says if just one of these ants, you know, starts standing up, they can push us
[3:34:56.840 --> 3:34:57.840]  aside.
[3:34:57.840 --> 3:34:58.840]  Yeah.
[3:34:58.840 --> 3:34:59.840]  Yeah.
[3:34:59.840 --> 3:35:05.280]  Basically, if they ever find out that we depend on them and not the other way around,
[3:35:05.280 --> 3:35:11.200]  then our way of life is over and that's precisely what we, what we face here.
[3:35:11.200 --> 3:35:16.640]  We are the ones with the power and they are the ones who are terrified of us finding that
[3:35:16.640 --> 3:35:22.760]  out and that's why there's been this massive constant campaign of suppression of knowledge
[3:35:22.760 --> 3:35:26.160]  and awareness to keep us in a smaller box than they're in.
[3:35:26.160 --> 3:35:30.720]  We're getting out of it more and more people are and it's going to be a very, very interesting
[3:35:30.720 --> 3:35:37.440]  few years as the irresistible force which is meets the irremovable, very immovable object
[3:35:37.440 --> 3:35:38.440]  which isn't.
[3:35:38.440 --> 3:35:43.880]  David, what do you think about the French students in England stabbed hundreds of times
[3:35:43.880 --> 3:35:51.040]  a piece ritualistically tortured biological weapons type students and we have all these
[3:35:51.040 --> 3:35:55.360]  other microbiologists and engineers being murdered all over the world.
[3:35:55.360 --> 3:35:56.880]  What do you think is going on behind that?
[3:35:56.880 --> 3:36:00.160]  Well, I've just seen that because I've been out with the election all day.
[3:36:00.160 --> 3:36:02.720]  I've just seen that on the news tonight.
[3:36:02.720 --> 3:36:08.120]  What they're doing in every area of our lives because we are now going towards this crunch
[3:36:08.120 --> 3:36:12.520]  point, this crunch point of awakening and all the rest of it and they are desperate
[3:36:12.520 --> 3:36:19.040]  to get this network of control in place.
[3:36:19.040 --> 3:36:25.240]  What they want essentially is for the cell door to click shut before enough people have
[3:36:25.240 --> 3:36:27.280]  realized they're even in a cell.
[3:36:27.280 --> 3:36:29.680]  So they're upping the ante all over the place now.
[3:36:29.680 --> 3:36:36.640]  I mean, we are having in this country the most incredible number of young people, interestingly,
[3:36:36.640 --> 3:36:45.680]  often they are either famous in terms of one was in a movie, a Harry Potter movie that's
[3:36:45.680 --> 3:36:51.160]  coming out and others are connected to famous people who are being stabbed to death.
[3:36:51.160 --> 3:36:57.840]  Now this is like so many it's unbelievable and it's upping the ante of fear so that they
[3:36:57.840 --> 3:37:06.560]  can impose the solutions which are this Orwellian state control and so we have to now start
[3:37:06.560 --> 3:37:13.400]  being aware and not just aware but have the courage not to fall for it and to see that
[3:37:13.400 --> 3:37:19.360]  it's there to enslave us and not to protect us and this is why information is the key.
[3:37:19.360 --> 3:37:23.840]  When people understand the game, then the game loses control over them.
[3:37:23.840 --> 3:37:31.120]  It's keeping the game from people that this whole or the suppression has been about.
[3:37:31.120 --> 3:37:36.400]  I'm reading that these guys that got killed butchered in a satanic style torture ritual
[3:37:36.400 --> 3:37:44.760]  where, studying parasites jumping between dog and cat fetuses, a bunch of the biological
[3:37:44.760 --> 3:37:49.000]  weapons guys in the U.S. were murdered ritualistically.
[3:37:49.000 --> 3:37:52.920]  The first one when it all started was in Virginia, remember they tortured him and carved a pentagram
[3:37:52.920 --> 3:37:53.920]  in his back?
[3:37:53.920 --> 3:38:05.920]  Yeah, the biotech industry with Monsanto of course, a prime among them, are a satanic,
[3:38:05.920 --> 3:38:13.920]  they're one of the most dark of all the cartels and they are far more powerful within this
[3:38:13.920 --> 3:38:16.760]  network than people realize.
[3:38:16.760 --> 3:38:23.080]  Well, Rumsfeld headed them, he heads every company that does particularly evil stuff.
[3:38:23.080 --> 3:38:24.080]  Why is that?
[3:38:24.080 --> 3:38:28.880]  Well, because he's evil, I mean I don't use the word evil very much, I think it's overused
[3:38:28.880 --> 3:38:34.400]  but if you take it as the opposite of live, spelled backwards, the opposite of life then
[3:38:34.400 --> 3:38:37.120]  evil is very appropriate with him.
[3:38:37.120 --> 3:38:43.640]  I mean he was the man that brought a spartan, this brain suppressant and brain destroyer.
[3:38:43.640 --> 3:38:48.800]  And he gave the reaction to North Korea, listen to this, listen to this, Mr. Bonomo was studying
[3:38:48.800 --> 3:38:54.120]  a parasite which can spread from cats to human fetuses, see it's a kill human weapon.
[3:38:54.120 --> 3:39:02.040]  Mr. Frez's research was into bacteria which create ethanol for use as fuel, boy let's
[3:39:02.040 --> 3:39:03.040]  go ahead.
[3:39:03.040 --> 3:39:08.960]  And we've had so many scientists at the cutting edge of their profession in these very areas
[3:39:08.960 --> 3:39:13.200]  you're talking about who have been taken out over the years, I mean there was even a book
[3:39:13.200 --> 3:39:18.440]  written about them at one point so many were taken out and they would be eating their meal
[3:39:18.440 --> 3:39:23.720]  in London, they would get up from it, drive to Bristol where they had a decent drive where
[3:39:23.720 --> 3:39:30.120]  they had no family connections, they'd jump off the big suspension bridge there and there's
[3:39:30.120 --> 3:39:34.240]  one after the other that came from the same office and of course all the surveillance
[3:39:34.240 --> 3:39:38.200]  cameras can never catch anything because they always turn off.
[3:39:38.200 --> 3:39:44.280]  Well we managed to have a situation where a Brazilian was shot eight times, seven times
[3:39:44.280 --> 3:39:50.920]  in the head while being held down at close range and of course the surveillance pictures
[3:39:50.920 --> 3:39:55.000]  didn't come out, obviously it wasn't working mate, listen to this, Frenchman killed in
[3:39:55.000 --> 3:40:03.200]  London was stabbed 196 times, they had been tortured ritualistically.
[3:40:03.200 --> 3:40:08.080]  Well you see this is again something that I've been talking about for a long long time
[3:40:08.080 --> 3:40:13.160]  and it seems so extreme and I know you have too, it seems so extreme that it's beyond
[3:40:13.160 --> 3:40:18.240]  people's ability to grasp that it's possible but what you're talking about here is something
[3:40:18.240 --> 3:40:24.520]  that goes on behind the scenes in secret as a matter of course across the world because
[3:40:24.520 --> 3:40:29.880]  the rituals these people are involved in are absolutely horrendous and clearly every now
[3:40:29.880 --> 3:40:34.840]  and again one breaks the surface and you can get a glimpse of what is the common thing
[3:40:34.840 --> 3:40:41.160]  behind the scenes that seems the rarity but it's not, it's the rarity when it comes to
[3:40:41.160 --> 3:40:43.040]  public attention.
[3:40:43.040 --> 3:40:50.720]  Amazing, DavidEig.com, we're going to take some calls now for David, we've only got ten
[3:40:50.720 --> 3:40:54.500]  minutes left but David just briefly, what is the time frame, do you think they're going
[3:40:54.500 --> 3:40:59.360]  to hit Iran if they do, how do you see that unfolding?
[3:40:59.360 --> 3:41:06.320]  Well you know I tell you what I learned a long time ago which is kind of you know going
[3:41:06.320 --> 3:41:10.840]  towards it, I was told that there was going to be a conflict with China, that's where
[3:41:10.840 --> 3:41:12.240]  it was leading.
[3:41:12.240 --> 3:41:18.920]  What they wanted was a third world war that would complete the process which the first
[3:41:18.920 --> 3:41:23.840]  world war started, League of Nations, the second world war took on United Nations.
[3:41:23.840 --> 3:41:27.480]  And they can ration and have drafts and crap down here.
[3:41:27.480 --> 3:41:31.800]  They want to bring in the world government so they can say, hey look the only way to
[3:41:31.800 --> 3:41:35.880]  stop war, in fact they said about the European Union, let's have a European Union trade together
[3:41:35.880 --> 3:41:40.800]  and then we'll stop wars in Europe, the only way to stop war is to have a world government
[3:41:40.800 --> 3:41:46.400]  and a world army and at the end of national armies so there's no more war and so they
[3:41:46.400 --> 3:41:52.720]  want a massive global conflict and China, I was told must have been fifteen years ago
[3:41:52.720 --> 3:41:58.040]  that that was where it was going to head and I think the Middle East is designed to be
[3:41:58.040 --> 3:42:05.520]  the powder keg that starts to draw them in and Iran could well be it, you see I may be
[3:42:05.520 --> 3:42:12.160]  a different to most people, I have real problems with the guy who's leading Iran, for him to
[3:42:12.160 --> 3:42:20.680]  come to power when he did, to take over or defeat someone who was perceived globally
[3:42:20.680 --> 3:42:24.240]  as a moderate which would have been very, very difficult.
[3:42:24.240 --> 3:42:25.400]  Which is what the people wanted.
[3:42:25.400 --> 3:42:30.520]  Yeah, it would have been very, very difficult to sell Iran as a danger to the world if he'd
[3:42:30.520 --> 3:42:36.160]  have won but this guy came in and then started speaking the language that allowed them to
[3:42:36.160 --> 3:42:39.960]  say, hey this man's dangerous, I've got great reservations about that.
[3:42:39.960 --> 3:42:44.480]  Well we know Reagan made deals for the arms for hostages, that was all staged and so we
[3:42:44.480 --> 3:42:48.480]  know there's major connections, let's take some calls for David Ike, always intriguing,
[3:42:48.480 --> 3:42:54.400]  author, documentary filmmaker, lecturer, Tim in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead Tim.
[3:42:54.400 --> 3:42:58.320]  Woody Harrelson once said in a movie, only two good things ever came out of England,
[3:42:58.320 --> 3:43:02.680]  America and the Beatles, I think it's time we update that list to the Watson Brothers
[3:43:02.680 --> 3:43:04.200]  and you David, David Ike.
[3:43:04.200 --> 3:43:07.920]  Well, thank you very much, it's very kind.
[3:43:07.920 --> 3:43:13.440]  Alex, it was David that led me to you through some of his books, it was sort of like you
[3:43:13.440 --> 3:43:17.520]  know your chemistry 101, David was the catalyst and you were the monomer and as you know I
[3:43:17.520 --> 3:43:21.720]  didn't come on your shoe for like six years now and I consider you both best friends that
[3:43:21.720 --> 3:43:22.720]  I've never met.
[3:43:22.720 --> 3:43:27.400]  David, I own four of your books, on the bottom of page 206 in The Biggest Secret, there's
[3:43:27.400 --> 3:43:33.920]  a picture in the Bohemian Grove of Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon with the inventor
[3:43:33.920 --> 3:43:38.880]  of plutonium, Glenn Seaborg, I'd love to see that picture put on one of your guys'
[3:43:38.880 --> 3:43:44.720]  sites and people just mass mail it to Michael Regan and ask him to please explain.
[3:43:44.720 --> 3:43:47.560]  Actually, I think we have that photo on InfoWars.com.
[3:43:47.560 --> 3:43:48.560]  That picture.
[3:43:48.560 --> 3:43:56.360]  Well, I mean that picture was so symbolic of the way that you've got two people, one
[3:43:56.360 --> 3:44:00.440]  was a B-movie actor jumping on an office horse at the time, the other one was a soon
[3:44:00.440 --> 3:44:08.200]  to be politician that was taking on Kennedy in the 1960 election and both, despite those
[3:44:08.200 --> 3:44:13.320]  vastly different backgrounds, were both at Bohemian Grove and both go on to be presidents
[3:44:13.320 --> 3:44:14.320]  of the United States.
[3:44:14.320 --> 3:44:17.640]  And by the way, you forgot that Eisenhower is also in the photo.
[3:44:17.640 --> 3:44:24.600]  Yeah, well, I mean, you know, and because Eisenhower rose so rapidly in the military
[3:44:24.600 --> 3:44:29.520]  and you only do that, and then to president, you only do that if the right people are behind
[3:44:29.520 --> 3:44:30.520]  you.
[3:44:30.520 --> 3:44:34.160]  And now we have Barack Obama, of course, bringing in change, I mean, you know, I mean,
[3:44:34.160 --> 3:44:35.840]  do me a favor, you know.
[3:44:35.840 --> 3:44:37.640]  Totally, what an order.
[3:44:37.640 --> 3:44:38.640]  That was my question.
[3:44:38.640 --> 3:44:42.040]  That was Brzezinski for president, I say, I think he's called Barack Obama.
[3:44:42.040 --> 3:44:46.280]  Senator McCain Obama, but Obama's got the really heavy hitters behind him.
[3:44:46.280 --> 3:44:47.440]  He's going to be bad news.
[3:44:47.440 --> 3:44:48.440]  Thank you, Tim.
[3:44:48.440 --> 3:44:51.320]  But he'll fool a lot of people for one more ride, one more scam.
[3:44:51.320 --> 3:44:52.320]  Yeah.
[3:44:52.320 --> 3:44:55.240]  I mean, you're not going to hear Barack Obama say they're carrying out eugenics against
[3:44:55.240 --> 3:44:57.040]  blacks like nobody else.
[3:44:57.040 --> 3:45:00.920]  No, he'll be attacked by the white racist and then, oh, he must be good for the blacks
[3:45:00.920 --> 3:45:04.760]  and then he'll lead the blacks right into the Planned Parenthoods.
[3:45:04.760 --> 3:45:06.280]  John and Ohio, you're on the air.
[3:45:06.280 --> 3:45:14.960]  Yes, I agree with Mr. Icke that the ultimate target of the neo-Cons is China and the stepping
[3:45:14.960 --> 3:45:16.360]  stones are Iraq and Iran.
[3:45:16.360 --> 3:45:17.360]  I totally agree with that.
[3:45:17.360 --> 3:45:20.320]  They even said so in a project for a new American century.
[3:45:20.320 --> 3:45:24.880]  But I think right now, the box that the media is trying to keep us in is that there's some
[3:45:24.880 --> 3:45:29.240]  kind of a difference between Obama and McCain.
[3:45:29.240 --> 3:45:34.440]  And I think, in a certain sense, the greater danger is Obama because so many people have
[3:45:34.440 --> 3:45:39.480]  been convinced through cult of personality that there's some kind of a difference.
[3:45:39.480 --> 3:45:43.800]  I think you made a good point there about how the neo-cons got their start in the Democratic
[3:45:43.800 --> 3:45:50.120]  Party through the Henry Jackson faction, the military industrial faction of the Democratic
[3:45:50.120 --> 3:45:53.200]  Party before they joined the Republicans.
[3:45:53.200 --> 3:46:00.800]  And I think there's so many people right at this point now that somehow make excuses
[3:46:00.800 --> 3:46:02.840]  for Obama when he gets on his knees.
[3:46:02.840 --> 3:46:04.560]  I hear you, John, we got a jump.
[3:46:04.560 --> 3:46:06.360]  We got a jump so we get the other callers.
[3:46:06.360 --> 3:46:09.840]  Yes, bottom line, this is the false left paradigm.
[3:46:09.840 --> 3:46:14.320]  It's time for people to grow up and until you realize they own all the major parties
[3:46:14.320 --> 3:46:18.880]  and until you realize the power, people think the president is the end all be all.
[3:46:18.880 --> 3:46:19.880]  He isn't.
[3:46:19.880 --> 3:46:20.880]  Is he, David?
[3:46:20.880 --> 3:46:21.880]  No.
[3:46:21.880 --> 3:46:22.880]  I mean, the president's a puppet.
[3:46:22.880 --> 3:46:24.560]  I mean, I have this line.
[3:46:24.560 --> 3:46:28.440]  If you can see him, he's not at the top of the pyramid.
[3:46:28.440 --> 3:46:34.520]  I mean, the people who are really pulling the strings are in the shadows, probably no
[3:46:34.520 --> 3:46:36.520]  one's ever heard of them, the real power.
[3:46:36.520 --> 3:46:37.520]  Graham and Seattle.
[3:46:37.520 --> 3:46:43.360]  These are just cardboard cutouts who are vehicles to introduce the legislation that
[3:46:43.360 --> 3:46:46.920]  changes society in line with the shadow people's agenda.
[3:46:46.920 --> 3:46:50.320]  And then we have a debate about whoever they put out in front of us instead of never looking
[3:46:50.320 --> 3:46:52.800]  above that to the real power structure.
[3:46:52.800 --> 3:46:53.800]  Graham and Seattle.
[3:46:53.800 --> 3:46:54.800]  Hi, David.
[3:46:54.800 --> 3:47:00.400]  It's good to hear you on, and I definitely agree with a lot of what you're saying, but
[3:47:00.400 --> 3:47:05.400]  one of the major ways that I feel like people dismiss ideas about 9-11 being an inside job
[3:47:05.400 --> 3:47:11.080]  or various depopulation schemes and whatnot, I'm looking at a Times Online article about
[3:47:11.080 --> 3:47:12.080]  you.
[3:47:12.080 --> 3:47:17.400]  On June 27, it says, reptilians beware David Icky is back, and it says, according to Mr.
[3:47:17.400 --> 3:47:20.480]  Ike, I'm sorry, David Ike, I'm sorry for pronouncing the name wrong.
[3:47:20.480 --> 3:47:24.520]  According to Mr. Ike's belief the world is ruled by a secret group of Illuminati, a race
[3:47:24.520 --> 3:47:28.000]  of shape-shifting reptilian humanoids known as the Babylonian Brotherhood.
[3:47:28.000 --> 3:47:29.000]  So I'm just trying to...
[3:47:29.000 --> 3:47:33.200]  Well, first of all, I posted that on my website today.
[3:47:33.200 --> 3:47:38.160]  It's one of the reports about me standing in this election.
[3:47:38.160 --> 3:47:43.520]  Well, some of the things that I've said over the years have been far out for most people,
[3:47:43.520 --> 3:47:46.120]  but just take this on board.
[3:47:46.120 --> 3:47:51.320]  Just look at what myself and Alex have been discussing in the last hour and a half or
[3:47:51.320 --> 3:47:52.320]  so.
[3:47:52.320 --> 3:47:58.080]  Look at the scale of what we've been discussing, the multi-subjects, the multi-levels of what
[3:47:58.080 --> 3:48:04.480]  we're discussing, and then ask yourself, could a group of people in dark suits around a table
[3:48:04.480 --> 3:48:08.160]  orchestrate all that, or is it bigger than that?
[3:48:08.160 --> 3:48:09.680]  I would say it's bigger than that.
[3:48:09.680 --> 3:48:14.280]  But if you disagree, that's your right, but it's my right to apply to you.
[3:48:14.280 --> 3:48:19.320]  You know, I go up to that point and then David goes off and does that, but I think it's...
[3:48:19.320 --> 3:48:25.800]  We need to all be open-minded, the elites do believe they are worshiping and being directed
[3:48:25.800 --> 3:48:27.920]  by demon creatures.
[3:48:27.920 --> 3:48:28.920]  Now whether that's...
[3:48:28.920 --> 3:48:29.920]  Absolutely.
[3:48:29.920 --> 3:48:33.360]  Whether that's real or not, I mean, they believe it.
[3:48:33.360 --> 3:48:37.960]  So that's why I think that certainly people can try to then say, well, we're all nuts.
[3:48:37.960 --> 3:48:43.440]  Hey, the Federal Reserve's private, they carried out 9-11, we can prove all that, and they've
[3:48:43.440 --> 3:48:48.080]  got things, five football fields long floating around above Dallas, and Larry King Live is
[3:48:48.080 --> 3:48:52.600]  saying aliens are about to land, the Pope says aliens are coming, they're our brothers.
[3:48:52.600 --> 3:48:56.800]  Something big is on the horizon, they're going to stage something, and so David Eich
[3:48:56.800 --> 3:48:59.920]  is at one-tenth as radical as Larry King Live is now.
[3:48:59.920 --> 3:49:01.920]  Graham, I appreciate your call.
[3:49:01.920 --> 3:49:02.920]  Joe...
[3:49:02.920 --> 3:49:07.760]  The thing I would say, Alex, is important, you know, I mean, people should just take what
[3:49:07.760 --> 3:49:09.200]  feels right to them.
[3:49:09.200 --> 3:49:14.920]  I mean, if they want to take the level of this conspiracy as it plays out in the five-cents
[3:49:14.920 --> 3:49:19.360]  world, then take it at that level, and let's react to that level, let's join together at
[3:49:19.360 --> 3:49:24.560]  that level, and ignore the things that you think are too far out, you know, you don't
[3:49:24.560 --> 3:49:27.440]  have to take it all, just take what feels right.
[3:49:27.440 --> 3:49:32.440]  Yeah, well, I know this, the elite really do think they're worshiping weird entities,
[3:49:32.440 --> 3:49:33.440]  and so...
[3:49:33.440 --> 3:49:34.440]  They certainly do.
[3:49:34.440 --> 3:49:37.520]  Yeah, they certainly are hardcore serious when they're cutting kids' heads off for it.
[3:49:37.520 --> 3:49:41.760]  Look, we're out of time, I don't want to cut a call here short.
[3:49:41.760 --> 3:49:45.720]  Hello, John, Lynn, because we're basically out of time, and I want to come back with
[3:49:45.720 --> 3:49:48.000]  some final comments in the final segment.
[3:49:48.000 --> 3:49:52.240]  David, I don't want to wait another two years or a year or whatever to have you back up.
[3:49:52.240 --> 3:49:53.720]  Can I have you up in the next few months again?
[3:49:53.720 --> 3:49:54.720]  Yeah, that would be great.
[3:49:54.720 --> 3:49:55.720]  David, I...
[3:49:55.720 --> 3:50:03.200]  If I could just finish on one thought, that we should not allow our sense of reality and
[3:50:03.200 --> 3:50:10.320]  our sense of possibility to be confused with what's actually possible, that's the big mistake
[3:50:10.320 --> 3:50:11.320]  we make.
[3:50:11.320 --> 3:50:12.320]  And then you narrow your horizons.
[3:50:12.320 --> 3:50:16.960]  It's not saying people accept what you're saying, it's saying just allow yourself to
[3:50:16.960 --> 3:50:21.600]  look at everything, and then that by itself will give you a wider view instead of shuttering
[3:50:21.600 --> 3:50:22.600]  what you're seeing.
[3:50:22.600 --> 3:50:27.600]  It's what Socrates is supposed to have said in ancient Greece, wisdom is knowing how little
[3:50:27.600 --> 3:50:28.600]  we know.
[3:50:28.600 --> 3:50:33.200]  That keeps your mind open, not to believe anything, but to be open to all possibility.
[3:50:33.200 --> 3:50:34.200]  Okay.
[3:50:34.200 --> 3:50:37.040]  Because the world's much bigger than the one we think we're living in.
[3:50:37.040 --> 3:50:39.440]  DavidIke.com, infowars.com is my site.
[3:50:39.440 --> 3:50:40.440]  David, thank you.
[3:50:40.440 --> 3:50:41.440]  Cheers, Alex.
[3:50:41.440 --> 3:50:45.160]  I'm gonna say bye to you during the break.
[3:50:45.160 --> 3:50:47.120]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[3:50:47.120 --> 3:50:51.640]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest
[3:50:51.640 --> 3:50:53.160]  hour there is hope.
[3:50:53.160 --> 3:50:55.960]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[3:50:55.960 --> 3:51:00.440]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[3:51:00.440 --> 3:51:01.960]  World Order master plan.
[3:51:01.960 --> 3:51:06.200]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[3:51:06.200 --> 3:51:11.400]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[3:51:11.400 --> 3:51:14.400]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[3:51:14.400 --> 3:51:19.000]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly
[3:51:19.000 --> 3:51:22.000]  to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[3:51:22.000 --> 3:51:26.180]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this
[3:51:26.180 --> 3:51:31.160]  online video library, by weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews
[3:51:31.160 --> 3:51:32.160]  and so much more.
[3:51:32.160 --> 3:51:38.560]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free, join PrisonPlanet.tv, burn the info bombs
[3:51:38.560 --> 3:51:45.560]  to disc, put them on the file sharing networks, bring down the New World Order, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[3:51:45.560 --> 3:51:49.680]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that
[3:51:49.680 --> 3:51:53.680]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[3:51:53.680 --> 3:51:54.680]  the water?
[3:51:54.680 --> 3:51:58.320]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed
[3:51:58.320 --> 3:51:59.520]  into the skin.
[3:51:59.520 --> 3:52:04.160]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to
[3:52:04.160 --> 3:52:09.680]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold,
[3:52:09.680 --> 3:52:11.040]  algae and fungus.
[3:52:11.040 --> 3:52:15.880]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever
[3:52:15.880 --> 3:52:16.880]  comes first.
[3:52:16.880 --> 3:52:21.080]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[3:52:21.080 --> 3:52:23.120]  iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[3:52:23.120 --> 3:52:24.120]  What about you?
[3:52:24.120 --> 3:52:29.480]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99, with
[3:52:29.480 --> 3:52:30.640]  free shipping.
[3:52:30.640 --> 3:52:36.160]  Call the Berkey guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.

[3:52:44.000 --> 3:52:47.000]  Hey Bonnie, no more pickpocketin' for us.
[3:52:47.000 --> 3:52:50.640]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without even knowing they've
[3:52:50.640 --> 3:52:51.640]  been robbed.
[3:52:51.640 --> 3:52:52.640]  How so Clyde?
[3:52:52.640 --> 3:52:55.840]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[3:52:55.840 --> 3:52:59.480]  Just by waving it near you, I can skin your credit card information while your card is
[3:52:59.480 --> 3:53:00.640]  still in your purse.
[3:53:00.640 --> 3:53:01.640]  Just watch.
[3:53:01.640 --> 3:53:03.800]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[3:53:03.800 --> 3:53:05.240]  You gotta be kidding me.
[3:53:05.240 --> 3:53:09.900]  Nope, with 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[3:53:09.900 --> 3:53:12.280]  As long as people don't hear about Identity Stronghold.
[3:53:12.280 --> 3:53:13.280]  Why?
[3:53:13.280 --> 3:53:14.840]  What's Identity Stronghold?
[3:53:14.840 --> 3:53:16.440]  They make the Secure Sleeve.
[3:53:16.440 --> 3:53:19.960]  When people keep their credit cards in the shield at Secure Sleeve, I can't read them.
[3:53:19.960 --> 3:53:23.080]  Do a lot of people already know about the Secure Sleeve?
[3:53:23.080 --> 3:53:24.080]  No way.
[3:53:24.080 --> 3:53:27.480]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[3:53:27.480 --> 3:53:30.120]  Clyde, we should get some of those Secure Sleeves.
[3:53:30.120 --> 3:53:31.200]  I already got some.
[3:53:31.200 --> 3:53:33.200]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[3:53:33.200 --> 3:53:38.040]  Identity Stronghold has Secure Sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.
[3:53:38.040 --> 3:53:39.040]  idstronghold.com?
[3:53:39.040 --> 3:53:40.040]  Right.
[3:53:40.040 --> 3:53:44.040]  Or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[3:53:44.040 --> 3:53:58.040]  Let's make stuff that we make, we'll be in line.
[3:53:58.040 --> 3:54:05.040]  That was with David Ike.
[3:54:05.040 --> 3:54:17.040]  I'm sorry for you, people of the world.
