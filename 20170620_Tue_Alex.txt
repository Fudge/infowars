[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  Alex Jones of the Muslim world, you know
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.000]  That man to state you watch your mouth
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.000]  Time to stop submitting to this charity
[00:36.000 --> 00:38.000]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  I heard that on Alex Jones
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  Info Wars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  We are in an information war
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  and we are losing that war
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  Nobody can dispute the fact
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  At your own risk
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.000]  InfoWars.com
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  InfoWars comes to mind
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  InfoWars
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  InfoWars.com
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.000]  InfoWars.com
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.000]  InfoWars.com
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  I want freedom, that's what I want
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  And that's what you should want
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  Hello, this is Hank Hill
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.000]  And I'm telling you what
[01:12.000 --> 01:14.000]  You need to listen to Alex Jones
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  I like that guy
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  That is the best
[01:20.000 --> 01:22.000]  From the front lines of the information war
[01:22.000 --> 01:24.000]  It's Alex Jones
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.000]  You know, I said that I was going to take off today
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  And spend some time with the family
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  But my family doesn't have any future
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  If I'm not here on air fighting the globalists
[01:32.000 --> 01:34.000]  If you're not there taking action
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  Because Trump's not taking any time off
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.000]  I can tell you that, it's maybe a golf game once a week
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.000]  While he meets with some world leader
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  So I'm here, because my children have no future
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  If we're not on the front lines of this fight
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  We're getting ready to launch more shows
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  More transmissions, hiring more crew
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  Right now is such a critical time
[01:50.000 --> 01:52.000]  Wild horses could not drag me
[01:52.000 --> 01:54.000]  Away, so I'm here
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  I'm here, ladies and gentlemen
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.000]  Tomorrow, I've got to take off the broadcast day
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  Because I'm going to have a bunch of experts
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  And technicians and people here
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  Getting ready to launch
[02:04.000 --> 02:06.000]  New TV satellites
[02:06.000 --> 02:08.000]  New radio affiliates
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  New broadcasts and so much more
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  So we are definitely
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.000]  In an expansion phase
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.000]  Against the globalist
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  That said, we're doing that tenuously
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  Despite the fact that Google is
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  Bandus advertising and killed about
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  Five million of funding
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  And you've seen all the other massive attacks
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.000]  Of them going after our affiliates
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.000]  And so much more, but I am doubling down
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  All in
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  Against the globalist
[02:34.000 --> 02:36.000]  I'm going to go 110%
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  I'm not going to play games doing this
[02:38.000 --> 02:40.000]  Historically, you know you win
[02:40.000 --> 02:42.000]  When you just bet everything on it
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  And you've got on your side
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.000]  So thank you all so much for tuning in today
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.000]  American citizen
[02:48.000 --> 02:50.000]  That Obama cut loose 17 months ago
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  In a coma, they ship him back
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  He dies in his mother and father's arms
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  And I remembered
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000]  All the leftists saying, oh, he's a white
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  Scumbag, you know, he deserves it
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  He tried to steal a poster off a wall
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  Or something
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  And of course the North Koreans never lie
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  So I'm sure it's all true
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  And so we're going to play some of the clips
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  Of the leftists
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  Again, invoking race
[03:16.000 --> 03:18.000]  Saying this frat boy deserves what happened to him
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.000]  Well, now he's dead
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  And the Huffington Post
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.000]  And MSNBC and others
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  They don't have egg on their face
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  Because they're proud of what they are
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  A part of
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  Worshiping any form of authoritarianism
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  As long as it's anti-western
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  Here's what the president had to say yesterday
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.000]  I just wanted to
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  Pass on word
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  That Otto Warmbier has just passed away
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  He spent a year and a half
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  In North Korea
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  A lot of bad things happened
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  But at least we got him home
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  To be with his parents
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  Where they were
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  So happy to see him
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  Even though he was
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  In very tough condition
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  But he just passed away a little while ago
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  That's a brutal regime
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  And
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  We'll be able to handle it
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  A lot of
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  Trendies
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  And I'm not saying Mr. Wimbier was one
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  But a lot of trendies
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  The trendy thing to do is go to North Korea
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  And they have trendy tours
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  And it's the big liberal thing
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  People pass around Kim Jong Un
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  Memorabilia, they make jokes about it
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  They think Communist China is cute
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  They think Cuba is cute
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  They think Venezuela is cute
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  They think the old Soviet Union is cute
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  It's the trendy thing
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  To sit here in the lap of freedom
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  Make jokes like the left has done
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  About his incarceration
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  And now he's dead
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  Oh, they may cancel
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  All your little tourist trips there though
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  To go see your little Communist
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  Wonderland for yourself
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  Alright ladies and gentlemen
[04:56.000 --> 04:58.000]  Colonel Shafer is warning of a bloody civil war
[04:58.000 --> 05:00.000]  We've been warning you as well
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.000]  That's coming up straight ahead
[05:02.000 --> 05:14.000]  This is the first Syrian aircraft
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.000]  To have been downed by the United States
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  Since 2011
[05:18.000 --> 05:20.000]  Washington justified the strike
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.000]  Claiming the jet drop bombs near U.S. back forces
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  While officials from Damascus said
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  They were attacking ISIS
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  Truth be told, these are most likely the same group
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  But we should be asking John McCain
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.000]  A question
[05:32.000 --> 05:34.000]  Russia has responded by saying it will now treat U.S. aircraft
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  Operating in Syria as targets
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  President Trump can't get a microphone loud enough
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  To ask for the Russia collusion investigation
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  To be over
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  But don't hold your breath on the Democrats finding common sense
[05:44.000 --> 05:46.000]  And logic overnight
[05:46.000 --> 05:48.000]  President Trump will still be investigated for collusion with Russia
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  While they are threatening him
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  And our country
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  President Trump, the globalists are trying to trap you
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  And trick you into a war in Syria
[05:56.000 --> 05:58.000]  In hopes it will cost you the 2020 election
[05:58.000 --> 06:00.000]  Don't fall for it

[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  While our Minions think
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  Trump's bad trying to keep radical Muslims out
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  I don't even know if that's true
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  I don't know if the media has spun that or whatever
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  Trump supporter was stabbed
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  And is currently in critical condition
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  In Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  After being identified as a conservative
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  And subsequently stabbed by an Armenian gang member
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  27 year old Tony
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  Foreman
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  And Tony O'Forman had just left the free speech rally
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  In California alongside a slew of other
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  Well known Trump supporters such as
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  Kyle Chapman
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  Afterward they had to do a local bar to relax
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  After a few hours at the bar of the group
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  Many drawing Trump hats
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  Supported bumper stickers
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  And their vehicles decided to retire for the night
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  That's when things were determined for the worst
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  As Tony approached his vehicle
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  Another car rammed through the parking gate
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  Vehicle barrier into the lot
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  Directly smashing into Tony's car
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  That sounds like Islamic jihad to me
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  There are Minions
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  Reportedly ex of the car
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  And reportedly were initially receptive
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  To exchanging insurance information
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  They walked the length of Mr. Foreman's car
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  Noticed multiple pro-patron stickers
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  Including Gadsden flag
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  And the American flag
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  And multiple other patriotic pro-republican stickers
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  On his back window
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  That's when things turned for the worst
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  After noticing these stickers
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  The Armenian gang members
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  Is reported then walked back to his car
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  Before re-approaching Mr. Foreman
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  The car's other passengers
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  Stepped out of the vehicle
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  Wielding knives within a matter of minutes
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  Mr. Foreman was stabbed nine times
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  Right before one of the gang members screamed
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  I'm going to shank you white boy
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  That's being reported by local newspapers
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  It's being reported by Infowars.com
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  Kid Daniels has a story up on it as well
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  I mean, that's what this country has turned into
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  With just the hype
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  Kill, kill, kill, and Bernie Sanders
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  After one of his supporters went and shot
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  Congressman's police
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  And four other people including two police officers
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  Has come out and said
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  By any means necessary
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  Get aggressive to his supporters
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  We've got a clip of that
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  Coming up and that ties in
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  With Colonel Schaefer
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  The videos on Infowars.com
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  And Colonel Schaefer's not your average
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  Lieutenant Colonel, he's tied in with
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  Major intelligence agencies, COG
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  You name it
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  He's one of the key people that's been exposing
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  Our government was behind Al Qaeda and ISIS
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  He headed up the anti Bin Laden
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  Group, of course
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  It was ordered to stand down twice before 9-11
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  He has come out and said
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  Definitely they're prepping for civil war
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  And trying to cause one
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  Now of course I said this first
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  And I've been saying this all along
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  But it's not about credit, it's about credibility
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  And I told you they'd use COG to do it
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  But there is an information warfare against the president
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  And the republic that intends to go high
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  Schaefer's now said that word for word
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  He's not getting it from me
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  We're looking at the exact same
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  Situation
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  That's why we're saying the exact
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  Same things
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  Because we're looking
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  With our research, with the terms
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  We know and with the history we know
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  That exactly what's happening
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  The globalists are using old play books
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  But with high tech weapons
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  So we're already in a soft civil war
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  And you've got Soros set for July 2nd
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  To launch rallies
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  Each week thereafter
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  Right through August
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  Calling for massive violence
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  Attacks on police
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  It's going to be hellish
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  And there's a big debate
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  With conservatives libertarians
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  Should we be nonviolent?
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  Absolutely, we should not be offensively violent
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  But if someone pulls a knife on you
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  And says I'm going to stab you
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  In a parking lot
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  Because you're a Trump supporter
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  Because you're white
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  Or because you are libertarian
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  Unload into their chest
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  It's better to be tried by nine
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  Than carried by six
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  The fourth turning
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  A summer of rage and the total eclipse
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  Of the deep state
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  Excellent article at zero hedge
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  I want to post that on infowars.com
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  It's from ten days ago
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  But it really boils it down
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  And that is exactly what's happening
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  In fact, I think David Knight's had the authors
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  Going on before, it's a historical cycle
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  That's been documented and we're approaching
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  The fourth turning right now
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  And the entrenched power structure
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  Knows that there's about to be a new renaissance
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  And they're really really really really upset
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  Right now
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  Now let me tell you the news
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  That's coming up
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  Moscow accuses Trump of returning
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  To Cold War style rhetoric in Cuba
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  Well, he's doing the right thing
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  With Cuba and I'll break down why
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  War with Russia
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  And I'll announce any U.S. warplanes flying over Syria
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  Will be treated as targets
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  And then I've got
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  Mainstream news articles
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  Saying you should be concerned
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  About World War III
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  Why World War III
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  Is more of a threat than ever
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  Here it is out of the week
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  Memo to America
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  You should still be terrified
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  Of World War III
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  Armed Russian jets come within five feet
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  Of U.S. recon jets
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  Yesterday I came out
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  And
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  Started the broadcast off saying
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  The United States and Russia are now in a standoff
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  The same type of standoff we saw
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  In the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1961
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  We're in the greatest danger we've been
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  Since then
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  This could easily trigger a new World War
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  Now that's what top analysts are saying
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  What top generals are saying
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  But then I saw liberal publications
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  All over the place say
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  Look at Jones' fear-mongering
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  Jones is saying
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  This could kick off a larger World War
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, that shows the delusional
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  Nature of liberals
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  That they're the main group
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  That goes to North Korea
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  It is the trendy thing to do
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  If you already like communism and socialism
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  You know, bring your smart phone whenever
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  Go on a tour to North Korea
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  Posed by the starving villagers
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  Make jokes about them
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  This is the culture
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  It's nasty and dirty to make fun of communist China
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  And Venezuela and Cuba
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  And say you hate America at the same time
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  But if you go there
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.000]  And you're not someone that hails communism
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  And salutes the paramilitary forces
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  You'll be grabbed
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.000]  You'll be tortured to death
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  And then the left will make jokes about it
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.000]  As they've done now
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  That's right, the Huffington Post and others
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  Making their normal
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  Standard jokes about auto
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  Warm beer
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  We're going to play some of those clips
[16:32.000 --> 16:34.000]  Of what they've had to say
[16:34.000 --> 16:36.000]  About
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  That situation
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  Truly
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  Truly
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  Disgusting
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  Now, that's coming up at the bottom of the hour
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  Then I'm going to get into
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  The stock market is at record highs
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  But the globalists admit
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  They're trying to plunge it to stop
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  The recovery
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  And that ties into
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  Even mainstream financial analysts
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  Are saying it is now time to break up
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  Amazon
[17:08.000 --> 17:10.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's even put in Walmart
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  Out of business in many areas
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.000]  Amazon in the major metrics is what is causing
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  Housing prices and building prices
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  And real estate prices to plunge
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  Amazon has a
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  Oligopoly
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  That they've been allowed to set up
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  With communist China, with the globalist
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  Bezos is a total eugenicist
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  Centralizer
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  He's partnered with the CIA
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  He owns the Washington Post
[17:36.000 --> 17:38.000]  Who they admit is the main weapon system
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  Against Trump and the American people
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  Now, he recently met with Trump
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  Showing a little bit of a capitulation
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  Because they've tried to overthrow Trump
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  They've tried to crush him, they've tried to destroy him
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  It's failed
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  Trump needs to know they're never going to stop
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  They will kiss him to his face
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  They will kiss him on the neck
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  Kiss him on the cheek, but behind his back
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  Their organs will continue to savage
[18:02.000 --> 18:04.000]  And go after him
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  But because of the free market
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  And because of basic systems of Americana
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  Our country, our economy
[18:10.000 --> 18:12.000]  This delicate ecosystem
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  That is a quasi-free market system
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  Cannot operate with behemoths like Amazon
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  Undercutting everybody
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  Creating monopolies
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  Who also censor libertarian
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  And conservative information
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  Notice Amazon can be the biggest seller in the world
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  Of supplements and pharmaceuticals
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  A lot of them, total crap
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  FDA does nothing
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  But the cleanest, best
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  Organizations that put out the most
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  Highly certified quality
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  Products get harassed
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  Because they're not mega giants
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  Notice MSM attacks us all day
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  Because we sell
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  From the purest, highest quality selenium
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  That we can find out there
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  Or we sell high quality vitamin mineral
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  Fruit punch, amino acid drinks
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  That are super popular
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  We go out to the top labs in the country
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  But it's snake oil when we sell shampoo
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  Or fluoride-free toothpaste
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  We're not allowed to exist
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  We're conspiracy theorists
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  Everything we do is evil and bad
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  But
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  Bezos
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  Can sell any nutraceutical supplement
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  But it gets worse
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  Now he bought Whole Foods
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  Of the almost 40 products we've got
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  10 of them are made by top labs
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  That produce for Whole Foods
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  And we private label
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  And the word is politically
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  They may not let us anymore
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  Bezos is a piece of work
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  Bezos
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  He can sell you supplements
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  I can't see because he's God
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  It's good when he sells them
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  When I sell them it's bad
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  When you have an economy
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  Patriots, Christians, conservatives
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  We're not allowed to have anything
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  That's why it's an act of resistance
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  And rebellion
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  When you buy products from our
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  High quality, secure shopping cart
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  And not from Amazon
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  That globalist anti-gun, anti-christian
[20:00.000 --> 20:24.000]  Islamic turdbasket
[20:24.000 --> 20:32.000]  And we have to do it
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.000]  So, in these uncertain times
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  It makes sense to have a sustainable backup method
[20:36.000 --> 20:38.000]  To cook food and boil water
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  If your current plan includes
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  Using a fuel burning stove
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  Or cooking over an open fire
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  Then there's a much better way
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  The Minuteman rocket stove
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  Is a biomass burning cooking stove
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  That only requires small quantities
[20:52.000 --> 20:54.000]  is portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.040]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves
[20:56.040 --> 20:58.560]  and fire starters made right here in the USA,
[20:58.560 --> 21:00.240]  go to MinutemanStove.com.
[21:00.240 --> 21:02.280]  That's MinutemanStove.com.
[21:03.480 --> 21:04.840]  Let's go to Devin and Florida.
[21:04.840 --> 21:07.200]  Devin and Florida, you're on the air.
[21:07.200 --> 21:08.760]  Great, hey, thank you so much.
[21:08.760 --> 21:11.680]  Listen, I have bought your product
[21:11.680 --> 21:13.360]  and I gotta say they're amazing.
[21:13.360 --> 21:14.200]  Thank you.
[21:14.200 --> 21:15.160]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it
[21:15.160 --> 21:18.840]  because I've got caveman, superman vitality,
[21:18.840 --> 21:21.400]  secret swell, fireman interfusion.
[21:21.400 --> 21:22.920]  I've got the body armor.
[21:22.920 --> 21:23.760]  Wow, thank you.
[21:23.760 --> 21:24.600]  Wow.
[21:24.600 --> 21:26.200]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[21:26.200 --> 21:28.000]  Which nutraceutical does you like best?
[21:28.000 --> 21:31.640]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion, to be honest.
[21:31.640 --> 21:32.480]  That's amazing.
[21:32.480 --> 21:33.320]  That's really incredible.
[21:33.320 --> 21:35.000]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you,
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.400]  I felt incredible, like I haven't felt the week.
[21:37.400 --> 21:40.360]  My morning was fantastic and I love you guys.
[21:40.360 --> 21:43.840]  I love the info work through and I just wanna,
[21:43.840 --> 21:46.160]  yeah, I wanna take this opportunity
[21:46.160 --> 21:48.440]  to tell anybody out there who's on the fence,
[21:48.440 --> 21:50.640]  John, buy it, you will love it.
[21:50.640 --> 21:52.880]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[21:52.880 --> 21:55.640]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find
[21:55.640 --> 21:57.400]  in our products at infowarslife.com.

[22:02.040 --> 22:04.240]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former Congressman
[22:04.240 --> 22:06.520]  and Republican presidential candidate.
[22:06.520 --> 22:08.840]  I love these summer months because this is when I get
[22:08.840 --> 22:10.840]  to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables
[22:10.840 --> 22:13.000]  that are being harvested on small farms
[22:13.000 --> 22:14.520]  and in our backyards.
[22:14.520 --> 22:17.520]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[22:17.520 --> 22:19.080]  Don't you wish there was a better way
[22:19.080 --> 22:21.480]  to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[22:21.480 --> 22:24.120]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[22:24.120 --> 22:27.000]  It's by using the amazing home freeze dryer
[22:27.000 --> 22:28.440]  from Harvest Right.
[22:28.440 --> 22:30.280]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer
[22:30.280 --> 22:32.440]  and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[22:32.440 --> 22:35.480]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream
[22:35.480 --> 22:37.720]  can stay fresh for 25 years.
[22:37.720 --> 22:40.560]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family
[22:40.560 --> 22:43.560]  and I have a supply of long-lasting food on hand.
[22:43.560 --> 22:46.880]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[22:46.880 --> 22:48.640]  We love our freeze dryer.

[23:01.200 --> 23:03.080]  The answer to being in control
[23:03.080 --> 23:06.280]  of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[23:06.280 --> 23:08.640]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients
[23:08.640 --> 23:11.960]  that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[23:11.960 --> 23:15.160]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month
[23:15.160 --> 23:17.160]  and $347 for families.
[23:17.160 --> 23:19.080]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[23:19.080 --> 23:21.480]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.

[23:31.440 --> 23:32.280]  This is Dan Pilla.
[23:32.280 --> 23:34.000]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[23:34.000 --> 23:35.640]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[23:35.640 --> 23:38.480]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[23:38.480 --> 23:40.760]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[23:40.760 --> 23:43.160]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you,
[23:43.160 --> 23:45.280]  there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[23:45.280 --> 23:49.280]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[23:49.280 --> 23:50.680]  With the IRS's new programs,
[23:50.680 --> 23:53.040]  there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[23:53.040 --> 23:57.200]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, that's 800-34-NO-TAX
[23:57.200 --> 23:59.800]  or my website, danpilla.com.
[23:59.800 --> 24:24.400]  Music
[24:24.400 --> 24:27.160]  So Jeff Bezos, then I'm gonna come back
[24:27.160 --> 24:28.520]  in the next segment and get into all the other news
[24:28.520 --> 24:31.200]  I mentioned from North Korea to what's happening
[24:31.200 --> 24:32.880]  with the globalists trying to start a civil war
[24:32.880 --> 24:34.000]  and so much more.
[24:34.000 --> 24:37.240]  Jeff Bezos is totally anti-gun,
[24:37.240 --> 24:39.640]  an absolute globalist elitist.
[24:39.640 --> 24:41.800]  He's been allowed to have multinational deals
[24:41.800 --> 24:44.080]  with European countries, socialist countries,
[24:44.080 --> 24:47.040]  communist countries that no one else is allowed to have
[24:47.040 --> 24:49.640]  because he works on centralizing control
[24:49.640 --> 24:52.000]  and propping up corrupt regimes.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.960]  He's partnered with the CIA with 600 million last year
[24:55.960 --> 24:58.480]  that Obama gave him to try to defeat Trump
[24:58.480 --> 25:01.840]  and to funnel that money through Amazon.
[25:01.840 --> 25:06.280]  The CIA now runs their main servers through amazon.com.
[25:06.280 --> 25:10.120]  So amazon.com is a leftist globalist utility
[25:10.120 --> 25:12.400]  of the leftist deep state in government.
[25:12.400 --> 25:14.800]  That's not rhetoric, that's a total definition,
[25:14.800 --> 25:16.680]  you heard it here first.
[25:16.680 --> 25:19.920]  And he finally went to the White House in the last few days
[25:19.920 --> 25:21.160]  and looked completely freaked out
[25:21.160 --> 25:22.440]  being up there with Trump,
[25:22.440 --> 25:25.920]  but at least he's being forced to now go and claim
[25:25.920 --> 25:27.520]  he's not gonna try to destroy Trump
[25:27.520 --> 25:28.800]  or butcher our economy.
[25:29.840 --> 25:31.920]  The problem is, if you dig through the news,
[25:31.920 --> 25:33.960]  even mainline analysts are saying,
[25:33.960 --> 25:36.160]  the real estate market commercially is plunging
[25:36.160 --> 25:37.240]  because of Amazon.
[25:40.880 --> 25:43.000]  And so if you expand on that,
[25:44.120 --> 25:45.840]  you look at all these other parts of the economy,
[25:45.840 --> 25:49.400]  it's only going down even that much faster
[25:49.400 --> 25:54.400]  and accelerating our journey to being a third world country.
[25:54.680 --> 25:56.360]  So we have to ask ourselves,
[25:56.360 --> 25:58.480]  what should Trump do?
[25:58.480 --> 26:02.680]  Well, under the 1906 Sherman Antitrust Act,
[26:02.680 --> 26:07.680]  Amazon shouldn't be able to control the market for retail
[26:08.160 --> 26:09.920]  to a point that even kills Walmart.
[26:09.920 --> 26:12.120]  Walmart killed Main Street.
[26:13.040 --> 26:16.200]  Amazon is killing competitiveness, the economy,
[26:16.200 --> 26:21.200]  the upwardly mobile wage, real estate, diversity, everything.
[26:21.200 --> 26:26.200]  It's absolutely crazy that you notice so many
[26:27.920 --> 26:29.880]  of the leftist real estate owners,
[26:30.800 --> 26:32.120]  they've all been for globalism,
[26:32.120 --> 26:33.600]  they've all been for socialism,
[26:33.600 --> 26:35.080]  they've all been for NAFTA and GATT,
[26:35.080 --> 26:38.240]  they bought into, we won't be an industrial economy,
[26:38.240 --> 26:40.320]  we won't be an agrarian economy,
[26:40.320 --> 26:42.360]  we won't be a localized economy,
[26:42.360 --> 26:44.080]  we'll be a global economy,
[26:44.080 --> 26:46.120]  and we'll have a service economy.
[26:46.120 --> 26:48.600]  And so Main Street went, ooh,
[26:48.600 --> 26:51.920]  and the retail stores went, ooh,
[26:51.920 --> 26:54.720]  wow, we really want this globalism,
[26:54.720 --> 26:56.800]  this is gonna be so good for us.
[26:56.800 --> 26:58.920]  And now the service economy
[26:58.920 --> 27:02.200]  is the fastest part of the economy imploding.
[27:02.200 --> 27:06.360]  And Trump's running in, trying to rebuild the industrial,
[27:06.360 --> 27:08.760]  trying to rebuild the infrastructure,
[27:08.760 --> 27:11.880]  trying to rebuild the agrarian, the farming,
[27:11.880 --> 27:14.080]  trying to kickstart it all,
[27:14.080 --> 27:16.600]  because there are thousands of regulations designed
[27:16.600 --> 27:19.800]  where it's impossible to have different types
[27:19.800 --> 27:21.440]  of smelting facilities,
[27:21.440 --> 27:24.680]  where it's impossible to have all these different types
[27:24.680 --> 27:27.440]  of operations, and they're the globalists,
[27:27.440 --> 27:29.200]  the Jeff Bezosas and everybody else,
[27:29.200 --> 27:30.800]  that know they're creating an economy
[27:30.800 --> 27:33.520]  that's meant to implode, controlled austerity,
[27:33.520 --> 27:36.120]  or then they're the only corporations left standing,
[27:36.120 --> 27:37.800]  exploiting what's left of the West,
[27:37.800 --> 27:40.400]  using Third World and Communist Chinese slave labor,
[27:40.400 --> 27:45.400]  a total global financial takeover. But this is what the left wanted.
[27:49.320 --> 27:53.160]  Nice, fake, trendy guys with their shaved heads
[27:53.160 --> 27:54.320]  and a little chicken necks,
[27:54.320 --> 27:57.480]  talking in effeminate voices like they're non-threatening,
[27:57.480 --> 28:00.760]  using class warfare, funding Black Lives Matter,
[28:00.760 --> 28:02.280]  funding open borders,
[28:02.280 --> 28:04.640]  funding the smashing of the nation-state,
[28:04.640 --> 28:06.840]  funding the total takeover of the culture,
[28:06.840 --> 28:11.200]  and then it's your very destruction,
[28:11.200 --> 28:13.560]  your very disenfranchisement.
[28:14.920 --> 28:16.400]  So Amazon can operate all day,
[28:16.400 --> 28:20.000]  but they shouldn't be able to have monopolistic practices,
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.280]  which they're famous for,
[28:21.280 --> 28:24.680]  and they shouldn't be able to come in and buy whole foods,
[28:26.200 --> 28:29.480]  and they shouldn't be selectively left alone by regulators
[28:29.480 --> 28:32.480]  at the Food and Drug Administration like they are,
[28:32.480 --> 28:34.840]  to be able to just do whatever they want,
[28:34.840 --> 28:36.520]  and then give huge financial contributions
[28:36.520 --> 28:38.520]  to politicians, and then those very politicians
[28:38.520 --> 28:41.800]  then sick the regulators on tens of thousands
[28:41.800 --> 28:44.600]  of other smaller, high-quality companies.
[28:45.560 --> 28:48.040]  That's what this is really all about.
[28:48.040 --> 28:49.560]  Now we're gonna go to break.
[28:49.560 --> 28:50.400]  We're gonna come back and get into
[28:50.400 --> 28:51.960]  all the really hardcore serious news,
[28:51.960 --> 28:55.760]  but President Trump needs to know when Google
[28:55.760 --> 28:58.120]  and when Facebook and when Amazon,
[28:58.120 --> 29:00.200]  the big three go and meet with him,
[29:00.200 --> 29:02.280]  they're absolutely lying to his face
[29:02.280 --> 29:04.520]  because everything he represents,
[29:04.520 --> 29:06.400]  the average person being self-sufficient,
[29:06.400 --> 29:08.080]  the average person being successful
[29:08.080 --> 29:10.240]  is the antithesis of what these globalists
[29:10.240 --> 29:11.080]  are actually wanting.
[29:11.080 --> 29:13.960]  They are cold-blooded consolidators of power,
[29:13.960 --> 29:16.760]  they are sociopathic, psychopathic control freaks,
[29:16.760 --> 29:18.960]  openly at war with the president.
[29:20.400 --> 29:22.720]  And the president needs to understand that Bezos
[29:22.720 --> 29:24.680]  is the man heading up the Washington Post,
[29:24.680 --> 29:26.480]  and it's a project to lie about him,
[29:26.480 --> 29:28.480]  to slander him, and to destroy him.
[29:29.840 --> 29:30.840]  Say what you want about Trump,
[29:30.840 --> 29:33.920]  but he's got the eye of the New World Order against him,
[29:33.920 --> 29:36.120]  and he's trying to desperately turn the economy back on,
[29:36.120 --> 29:38.080]  and if people don't get behind him and push hard
[29:38.080 --> 29:40.760]  and realize the problem is the Republican Congress,
[29:40.760 --> 29:42.960]  it's a bunch of cowards, they're the enemy.
[29:44.000 --> 29:44.840]  Trump's not the enemy,
[29:44.840 --> 29:46.520]  the Democrats and the Republican leadership,
[29:46.520 --> 29:47.360]  they're the enemy,
[29:47.360 --> 29:50.200]  they stand in the way of our prosperity and our future,
[29:50.200 --> 29:52.000]  and they want to enslave us.
[29:52.000 --> 29:55.840]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:55.840 --> 29:58.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:58.800 --> 30:03.800]  Well, the left is getting a taste of its own medicine.
[30:03.800 --> 30:05.360]  On Friday night, Laura Loomer rushed the stage
[30:05.360 --> 30:08.080]  of the New York Public Disgrace Theater showing of Caesar,
[30:08.080 --> 30:09.520]  which should really be called Trump,
[30:09.520 --> 30:12.080]  a play depicting the assassination of President Trump.
[30:12.080 --> 30:13.960]  She rushed the stage insinuating the blood
[30:13.960 --> 30:16.640]  of Steve Scalise and others is on their hands,
[30:16.640 --> 30:18.760]  as well as mainstream television news,
[30:18.760 --> 30:21.400]  which has fanned the flames of fake news and hatred.
[30:21.400 --> 30:22.720]  While she was being arrested,
[30:22.720 --> 30:25.880]  Jack Pasobic went live on Twitter to broadcast the event,
[30:25.880 --> 30:28.440]  and then went on to tell all the brainwashed liberals
[30:28.440 --> 30:30.960]  in the audience that Joseph Goebbels would be proud
[30:30.960 --> 30:31.800]  of this product,
[30:31.800 --> 30:34.000]  and that they were Nazis.
[30:34.000 --> 30:36.000]  While the left is having side effects of outrage
[30:36.000 --> 30:37.080]  to their own medicine,
[30:37.080 --> 30:38.480]  even allies in the Trump movement
[30:38.480 --> 30:40.480]  have been at odds over the protest.
[30:40.480 --> 30:42.200]  Regardless, the very next night,
[30:42.200 --> 30:44.000]  more protesters took the stage,
[30:44.000 --> 30:47.080]  shouting Goebbels would be proud, CNN is ISIS.
[30:47.080 --> 30:48.880]  While the protesters were all arrested,
[30:48.880 --> 30:51.040]  rumor has it some of the police involved
[30:51.040 --> 30:52.960]  support the protest against the expression
[30:52.960 --> 30:54.880]  of hatred and violence demonstrated
[30:54.880 --> 30:57.680]  by the New York Public Theater against our president.
[30:57.680 --> 31:01.320]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen
[31:01.320 --> 31:02.160]  Shroyer.
[31:32.320 --> 31:35.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment,
[31:35.000 --> 31:37.440]  while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:37.440 --> 31:40.360]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[31:40.360 --> 31:42.520]  The general public doesn't.
[31:42.520 --> 31:46.360]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:46.360 --> 31:49.040]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet
[31:49.040 --> 31:50.000]  incredibly clean.
[31:50.000 --> 31:51.800]  This is a system I'm personally putting in
[31:51.800 --> 31:52.640]  throughout my house,
[31:52.640 --> 31:54.720]  replacing older, more expensive filters
[31:54.720 --> 31:56.720]  that didn't do as good a job.
[31:56.720 --> 31:59.720]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today.
[31:59.720 --> 32:01.720]  At infowarsstore.com.
[32:30.720 --> 32:33.120]  Super male vitality of so many others,
[32:33.120 --> 32:34.760]  with its unique delivery system
[32:34.760 --> 32:36.880]  and proprietary manufacturing process
[32:36.880 --> 32:38.880]  designed for maximized effects.
[32:38.880 --> 32:41.280]  This formula is the platinum standard
[32:41.280 --> 32:43.280]  of multivitamin mineral products,
[32:43.280 --> 32:45.360]  and this part is most important.
[32:45.360 --> 32:47.800]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion
[32:47.800 --> 32:49.640]  are either plant derived
[32:49.640 --> 32:52.200]  or of the highest quality lab standard.
[32:52.200 --> 32:54.720]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure,
[32:54.720 --> 32:55.680]  and rest secured,
[32:55.680 --> 32:57.680]  you're finding the tip of the spear in the Infowars.
[32:57.680 --> 32:59.040]  That's infowarslives.com
[32:59.040 --> 33:00.480]  and vitamin mineral fusion.
[33:00.480 --> 33:02.440]  Take action now before we sell out.
[33:02.440 --> 33:31.440]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[33:31.440 --> 33:33.440]  it's Alex Jones.
[33:51.440 --> 33:53.440]  So Jeff Bezos,
[33:53.440 --> 33:54.440]  the head of Amazon,
[33:54.440 --> 33:56.440]  the biggest company in the world,
[33:56.440 --> 33:58.440]  he's the richest man in the world.
[33:58.440 --> 34:00.440]  He's a big liberal for class warfare,
[34:00.440 --> 34:02.440]  and he funds Black Lives Matter
[34:02.440 --> 34:04.440]  and all the anti-police violence with George Soros,
[34:04.440 --> 34:06.440]  and he works with all these dictatorship
[34:06.440 --> 34:09.440]  around the world, getting slave goods brought in.
[34:09.440 --> 34:11.440]  And if Walmart killed Main Street,
[34:11.440 --> 34:14.440]  well, Amazon's killing real estate communities,
[34:14.440 --> 34:16.440]  basically total deindustrialization,
[34:16.440 --> 34:18.440]  and he's been waging war against Trump,
[34:18.440 --> 34:20.440]  who wanted to simply give us the same power price
[34:20.440 --> 34:22.440]  as China has,
[34:22.440 --> 34:24.440]  and then simply wanted to turn our power plants back on.
[34:24.440 --> 34:27.440]  Well, he was forced to go be part of this summit yesterday,
[34:27.440 --> 34:29.440]  because Trump is defeating him, we're defeating him,
[34:29.440 --> 34:31.440]  so he went to the summit,
[34:31.440 --> 34:34.440]  but bugged his eyes out and basically acted like
[34:34.440 --> 34:36.440]  he hated President Trump.
[34:39.440 --> 34:41.440]  And again, I want to just warn the world,
[34:41.440 --> 34:43.440]  Bezos and other globalists are snakes
[34:43.440 --> 34:45.440]  that want to suppress our economy,
[34:45.440 --> 34:47.440]  that want to dominate and totally control
[34:47.440 --> 34:49.440]  our civilization and our society,
[34:49.440 --> 34:52.440]  and Trump is trying to turn our economy back on.
[34:52.440 --> 34:55.440]  That is why they are so upset.
[34:55.440 --> 34:57.440]  That is why they are so mad,
[34:57.440 --> 35:00.440]  because they have an economic consolidation plan,
[35:00.440 --> 35:02.440]  just like they do in the third world,
[35:02.440 --> 35:06.440]  they have 99% of people poor and a tiny 1% at the top.
[35:06.440 --> 35:09.440]  But when you look at where half the wealth of the world already is,
[35:09.440 --> 35:11.440]  we've done the math before,
[35:11.440 --> 35:17.440]  it's.00000000004.2 or something.
[35:17.440 --> 35:18.440]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[35:18.440 --> 35:20.440]  It's not one-tenth of 1%.
[35:20.440 --> 35:23.440]  It's not one-tenth of one-tenth of one-tenth percent.
[35:23.440 --> 35:25.440]  I mean, it just goes on.
[35:25.440 --> 35:27.440]  The math is staggering.
[35:27.440 --> 35:29.440]  Out of 7.5 billion people,
[35:29.440 --> 35:31.440]  different estimates are out there,
[35:31.440 --> 35:33.440]  but some estimates show that
[35:33.440 --> 35:37.440]  just the top one-tenth of 1% has half the wealth.
[35:37.440 --> 35:40.440]  And then it's the 1% that has like 80% of the wealth,
[35:40.440 --> 35:43.440]  depending on how you slice the numbers.
[35:43.440 --> 35:46.440]  It's just incredible.
[35:46.440 --> 35:51.440]  But the Bezos' and the Lloyd Blankfines of the world,
[35:51.440 --> 35:54.440]  they are funding the massive leftist ideology,
[35:54.440 --> 35:58.440]  because it's incompatible with a free market society.
[35:58.440 --> 36:01.440]  And they want to wreck the ladder up everybody else.
[36:01.440 --> 36:03.440]  It's a fact North Korea is a hellhole.
[36:03.440 --> 36:05.440]  It's a fact that Soviet Russia was a hellhole.
[36:05.440 --> 36:08.440]  It's a fact that Eastern Europe got wrecked by communism.
[36:08.440 --> 36:10.440]  It's a fact that Latin American countries that adopted it
[36:10.440 --> 36:13.440]  went from wealthy to poor almost overnight.
[36:13.440 --> 36:18.440]  It's a fact it creates a top-down bullying nightmare situation.
[36:18.440 --> 36:23.440]  But you've got lots of lazy children of children of children
[36:23.440 --> 36:26.440]  who grow up in the lap of luxury and don't want to work
[36:26.440 --> 36:28.440]  and just know how to bitch and complain all day
[36:28.440 --> 36:31.440]  who want to pull down what's left of our sputtering,
[36:31.440 --> 36:35.440]  faltering free market that's got black smoke coming out the back
[36:35.440 --> 36:39.440]  and is operating maybe at 10% of capacity.
[36:39.440 --> 36:41.440]  And even at 10% of its capacity,
[36:41.440 --> 36:43.440]  conservatively, they're complaining and hating it
[36:43.440 --> 36:46.440]  with their smartphones, with their designer shirts,
[36:46.440 --> 36:48.440]  with their designer shoes, in their cars,
[36:48.440 --> 36:51.440]  in their apartments, even the poorest of the trendies,
[36:51.440 --> 36:53.440]  is wealthier than people in most parts of the world,
[36:53.440 --> 36:58.440]  but they hate it because they lost for conquest.
[36:58.440 --> 36:59.440]  They've never really been in a fight,
[36:59.440 --> 37:01.440]  they've never really run a business,
[37:01.440 --> 37:03.440]  they've never been in the military,
[37:03.440 --> 37:07.440]  but they imagine the great social structures coming down
[37:07.440 --> 37:12.440]  and them ruling things and them being bosses and executives
[37:12.440 --> 37:14.440]  and people like Bezos know their psychology,
[37:14.440 --> 37:19.440]  they know their mindset, they know who they are.
[37:19.440 --> 37:23.440]  And it's totally disgusting to watch them played.
[37:23.440 --> 37:32.440]  Now, I've got a lot to cover and a lot to break down
[37:32.440 --> 37:35.440]  and obviously go over here today.
[37:35.440 --> 37:38.440]  Hannity has come out and agreed with InfoWars
[37:38.440 --> 37:41.440]  that NBC should release the full hours and hours
[37:41.440 --> 37:44.440]  and hours of interview I did with Megan Kelly,
[37:44.440 --> 37:47.440]  even New Yorker Magazine and others say it looks totally edited
[37:47.440 --> 37:51.440]  and jump cut where it's indistinguishable what I was saying
[37:51.440 --> 37:55.440]  to make me look like a stammering, blubbering buffoon.
[37:55.440 --> 38:00.440]  They interviewed me for often on four hours over 12 hours,
[38:00.440 --> 38:03.440]  they were here roughly 9.30 in the morning
[38:03.440 --> 38:06.440]  to almost 11 at night, so more than 12 hours.
[38:06.440 --> 38:08.440]  And then they have maybe two minutes of me
[38:08.440 --> 38:12.440]  in 19 minutes, blubbering and stammering.
[38:12.440 --> 38:16.440]  Anyone that's heard the show knows.
[38:16.440 --> 38:19.440]  That I'm teleprompter free and I'm the opposite
[38:19.440 --> 38:22.440]  of blubbering and stammering.
[38:22.440 --> 38:24.440]  But then if you listen for an hour,
[38:24.440 --> 38:27.440]  I will get ahead of myself and a few times stammer
[38:27.440 --> 38:32.440]  or stutter because I'm so excited or I'll pause.
[38:32.440 --> 38:34.440]  And that's all they did was cut it together
[38:34.440 --> 38:36.440]  to make me look like a buffoon.
[38:36.440 --> 38:38.440]  But people hate mainstream media so much
[38:38.440 --> 38:40.440]  that we now have the ratings.
[38:40.440 --> 38:43.440]  She not only had the lowest ratings for Dateline NBC
[38:43.440 --> 38:47.440]  and its 20 plus year history, 3.5 million viewers.
[38:47.440 --> 38:50.440]  According to the Daily Mail, according to Variety,
[38:50.440 --> 38:52.440]  according to the Nielsen ratings,
[38:52.440 --> 38:55.440]  she had the lowest ratings in her slot
[38:55.440 --> 39:00.440]  in all of broadcast television.
[39:00.440 --> 39:02.440]  Isn't that interesting?
[39:02.440 --> 39:05.440]  And they posted it on NBC News site days ago.
[39:05.440 --> 39:08.440]  It only had 179,000 views when our videos
[39:08.440 --> 39:13.440]  about it have 20 plus million views.
[39:13.440 --> 39:16.440]  I mean, you know, I shouldn't have been interviewed by her.
[39:16.440 --> 39:19.440]  This is kind of like the final nail on the coffin.
[39:19.440 --> 39:28.440]  It is such a joke to be on a show like that.
[39:28.440 --> 39:32.440]  It shows how there's nothing more uncool
[39:32.440 --> 39:34.440]  than being on mainstream television
[39:34.440 --> 39:37.440]  and being associated with Hollywood or any of it.
[39:37.440 --> 39:40.440]  Our listeners hate it.
[39:40.440 --> 39:42.440]  They love seeing his troller and release, you know,
[39:42.440 --> 39:45.440]  part of the behind the scenes early to show she's a liar,
[39:45.440 --> 39:47.440]  but they're sick of hearing about her.
[39:47.440 --> 39:49.440]  But Hannity's right.
[39:49.440 --> 39:51.440]  He got interviewed by Ted Koppel
[39:51.440 --> 39:53.440]  and said that Ted edited it together
[39:53.440 --> 39:55.440]  to make him look like an idiot.
[39:55.440 --> 39:57.440]  Another guy that can think on his feet
[39:57.440 --> 39:59.440]  better than almost anybody, Sean Hannity,
[39:59.440 --> 40:01.440]  that was edited.
[40:01.440 --> 40:03.440]  Remember a few months ago to be fake?
[40:03.440 --> 40:05.440]  And it's the same thing.
[40:03.440 --> 40:05.440]  So Hannity has said release it.
[40:05.440 --> 40:07.440]  He's going to come up.
[40:05.440 --> 40:07.440]  Colonel Shaffer warns the bloody Civil War.
[40:07.440 --> 40:09.440]  The style of collapse.
[40:07.440 --> 40:09.440]  That's really our biggest news.
[40:09.440 --> 40:11.440]  They're all ties together.
[40:11.440 --> 40:15.440]  But before I go any further, ladies and gentlemen,
[40:15.440 --> 40:19.440]  the globalists are trying to shut down info wars.
[40:19.440 --> 40:21.440]  And we've never had this many viewers.
[40:21.440 --> 40:23.440]  We've never had this many listeners,
[40:23.440 --> 40:25.440]  but they've gone after our sponsors.
[40:25.440 --> 40:27.440]  They kicked us off Google ads.
[40:27.440 --> 40:29.440]  Another reason Google's a monopoly
[40:29.440 --> 40:31.440]  is they won't even give conservatives and libertarians
[40:31.440 --> 40:34.440]  access to the marketplace.
[40:34.440 --> 40:36.440]  That's beyond. That's discriminatory.
[40:36.440 --> 40:38.440]  That's beyond monopoly.
[40:38.440 --> 40:40.440]  That's what the left wants.
[40:38.440 --> 40:40.440]  They want to put us on electronic ghettos
[40:40.440 --> 40:43.440]  that Matt Drudge warned about a year and a half ago
[40:43.440 --> 40:45.440]  where they have total control.
[40:45.440 --> 40:47.440]  That's what we've got to build our own systems.
[40:47.440 --> 40:50.440]  But Amazon and others won't even let us basically do that.
[40:50.440 --> 40:52.440]  Because they're trying to smother us.
[40:52.440 --> 40:54.440]  They're trying to stop us from growing.
[40:54.440 --> 40:57.440]  But info wars has grown to be the biggest resistance
[40:57.440 --> 41:01.440]  multimedia arm out there in the face of the New World Order.
[41:01.440 --> 41:03.440]  There's Drudge that's so huge
[41:03.440 --> 41:05.440]  being able to focus on stories
[41:05.440 --> 41:07.440]  and get people talking about certain subjects.
[41:07.440 --> 41:09.440]  And Drudge is the biggest thing out there.
[41:09.440 --> 41:11.440]  And then there's info wars.
[41:14.440 --> 41:17.440]  Breitbart is having massive revenue problems.
[41:17.440 --> 41:20.440]  Daily caller, all of them are in deep trouble
[41:20.440 --> 41:22.440]  because conservatives thought Trump won.
[41:22.440 --> 41:24.440]  They thought that was the big battle.
[41:24.440 --> 41:26.440]  They can go to sleep.
[41:26.440 --> 41:28.440]  The big war started, as you can see,
[41:28.440 --> 41:30.440]  when Trump won and we got that beachhead
[41:30.440 --> 41:32.440]  because if they let him get good Supreme Court justices in
[41:32.440 --> 41:34.440]  and if they let him cut taxes
[41:34.440 --> 41:36.440]  and if they let him kill Obamacare
[41:36.440 --> 41:38.440]  and if they let him secure the borders
[41:38.440 --> 41:40.440]  and if they let him get us out of TPP,
[41:40.440 --> 41:42.440]  unelected global government
[41:42.440 --> 41:44.440]  and if they let him kill the carbon tax,
[41:44.440 --> 41:46.440]  they're done.
[41:46.440 --> 41:48.440]  The globalist hijacked America
[41:48.440 --> 41:50.440]  and built this global unelected monstrosity
[41:50.440 --> 41:52.440]  on fraud and now the president
[41:52.440 --> 41:54.440]  under the constitution is killing it
[41:54.440 --> 41:56.440]  one step at a time.
[41:56.440 --> 41:58.440]  They don't know what to do.
[41:58.440 --> 42:01.440]  They're openly marketing and pushing for his death.
[42:01.440 --> 42:03.440]  They're openly calling for his overthrow
[42:03.440 --> 42:05.440]  and they want my overthrow.
[42:05.440 --> 42:07.440]  And I am so honored
[42:07.440 --> 42:09.440]  that we saw the biggest, most disgusting,
[42:09.440 --> 42:11.440]  filthy, edited, twisted
[42:11.440 --> 42:13.440]  hit piece in history.
[42:13.440 --> 42:15.440]  They've never put a more one-sided
[42:15.440 --> 42:17.440]  hit piece out and admitted
[42:17.440 --> 42:19.440]  it was a one-sided hit piece
[42:19.440 --> 42:21.440]  and got all the publications to cheer
[42:21.440 --> 42:23.440]  for a hit piece and the public
[42:23.440 --> 42:25.440]  tuned out and didn't want to hear it.
[42:25.440 --> 42:27.440]  We had record views and listeners.
[42:27.440 --> 42:29.440]  Our coverage had
[42:29.440 --> 42:31.440]  20 plus million views on videos
[42:31.440 --> 42:33.440]  alone.
[42:33.440 --> 42:35.440]  That's just counting my videos and Cernovich's.
[42:35.440 --> 42:37.440]  I don't have time to go count up all the other videos on it.
[42:37.440 --> 42:39.440]  But the pro Alex Jones,
[42:39.440 --> 42:41.440]  pro Info Wars, 20 plus million,
[42:41.440 --> 42:43.440]  she had 3.5
[42:43.440 --> 42:45.440]  on the broadcast.
[42:45.440 --> 42:47.440]  As of this morning,
[42:47.440 --> 42:49.440]  179,000
[42:49.440 --> 42:51.440]  on NBC News's
[42:51.440 --> 42:53.440]  YouTube. No one wants to watch it.
[42:53.440 --> 42:55.440]  We got 20 million.
[42:55.440 --> 42:59.440]  She's got less than 4 million.
[42:59.440 --> 43:01.440]  Again, that shows
[43:01.440 --> 43:03.440]  how they don't matter and Congress
[43:03.440 --> 43:05.440]  needs to know, call MSM's bluff.
[43:05.440 --> 43:07.440]  Stop being so scared of them
[43:07.440 --> 43:09.440]  when they call you a racist or call you a
[43:09.440 --> 43:11.440]  demon or call you a child molester
[43:11.440 --> 43:13.440]  or call you all these things that they are.
[43:13.440 --> 43:15.440]  So much of Congress
[43:15.440 --> 43:17.440]  is still absolutely lap dog
[43:17.440 --> 43:19.440]  and loves to go on Meet the Press
[43:19.440 --> 43:21.440]  and loves to go on Face the Nation
[43:21.440 --> 43:23.440]  and loves to feel like they're part of the establishment.
[43:23.440 --> 43:25.440]  No, that's the plague.
[43:25.440 --> 43:27.440]  And that final
[43:27.440 --> 43:29.440]  illusion is falling
[43:29.440 --> 43:31.440]  and that's why they're so scared.
[43:31.440 --> 43:33.440]  But that said, we need
[43:33.440 --> 43:35.440]  financial support more than ever.
[43:35.440 --> 43:37.440]  I would ask all the listeners to commit
[43:37.440 --> 43:39.440]  to go to infowarsstore.com
[43:39.440 --> 43:41.440]  and to battle the Amazons
[43:41.440 --> 43:43.440]  and the Bezosas and you name it,
[43:43.440 --> 43:45.440]  a high tech, secure, quality
[43:45.440 --> 43:47.440]  shopping center
[43:47.440 --> 43:49.440]  that has the preparedness items,
[43:49.440 --> 43:51.440]  the health and wellness, the media,
[43:51.440 --> 43:53.440]  the gear, the specials
[43:53.440 --> 43:55.440]  and infowarslife, the supplements.
[43:55.440 --> 43:57.440]  The highest quality
[43:57.440 --> 43:59.440]  storeable foods, the highest quality
[44:01.440 --> 44:03.440]  grass certified,

[44:15.440 --> 44:17.440]  and iodine.
[44:17.440 --> 44:19.440]  Vitamineral fusion, M-Rex essentials, it's all there
[44:19.440 --> 44:21.440]  and we're running a special
[44:21.440 --> 44:23.440]  this summer, for the next two weeks

[44:35.440 --> 44:37.440]  Free speech is now being

[45:51.440 --> 45:53.440]  deep-earth crystal source that anybody

[45:55.440 --> 45:57.440]  Learn about that.
[45:57.440 --> 45:59.440]  Learn about why these are such game-changing
[45:59.440 --> 46:01.440]  products. Why
[46:01.440 --> 46:03.440]  BrainForce is such an amazing new
[46:03.440 --> 46:05.440]  tropic for the brain and why it's so popular
[46:05.440 --> 46:07.440]  on third-party sites. But whatever you do, support
[46:07.440 --> 46:09.440]  the broadcast and pray for us because we've got
[46:09.440 --> 46:11.440]  the enemy's attention and we represent
[46:11.440 --> 46:13.440]  the defense of free speech. We represent
[46:13.440 --> 46:15.440]  the republic. We represent religious
[46:15.440 --> 46:17.440]  freedom. We represent the fight against radical
[46:17.440 --> 46:19.440]  Islam that doesn't recognize religious
[46:19.440 --> 46:21.440]  freedom. We represent the fight for families.
[46:21.440 --> 46:23.440]  We represent the defense
[46:23.440 --> 46:25.440]  of the west for no matter what color you are
[46:25.440 --> 46:27.440]  but for the renaissance.
[46:27.440 --> 46:29.440]  And we're fighting as hard
[46:29.440 --> 46:31.440]  as we can and whether it's
[46:31.440 --> 46:33.440]  patriot t-shirts to meet like-minded people
[46:33.440 --> 46:35.440]  and spread the word or whether it is high-quality
[46:35.440 --> 46:37.440]  non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[46:37.440 --> 46:39.440]  We have the widest selection, lowest prices.
[46:39.440 --> 46:41.440]  It's all available at
[46:41.440 --> 46:43.440]  mfowarstore.com or
[46:43.440 --> 46:45.440]  AAA-253-3139.
[46:45.440 --> 46:47.440]  And I want to salute all of you that have stood up
[46:47.440 --> 46:49.440]  at the bullies at CNN and that have charged
[46:49.440 --> 46:51.440]  their public
[46:51.440 --> 46:53.440]  events peacefully and gotten on air exposing
[46:53.440 --> 46:55.440]  that they side with ISIS.
[46:55.440 --> 46:57.440]  I want to salute you all that are getting those t-shirts
[46:57.440 --> 46:59.440]  and wearing them out in public. I want to salute all of you
[46:59.440 --> 47:01.440]  that are getting your concealed carry and wearing it on
[47:01.440 --> 47:03.440]  your hip. So when these leftist terrorists try to kill
[47:03.440 --> 47:05.440]  you, you can defend yourself.
[47:05.440 --> 47:07.440]  That's happening more and more
[47:07.440 --> 47:09.440]  because we're praying for peace but we're preparing
[47:09.440 --> 47:11.440]  for war and it takes money to fund a war
[47:11.440 --> 47:13.440]  and mfo wars is the tip of the
[47:13.440 --> 47:15.440]  spear in that fight. All right, thank you all
[47:15.440 --> 47:17.440]  for the support. It is essential.
[47:17.440 --> 47:19.440]  Now
[47:23.440 --> 47:25.440]  Civil War
[47:27.440 --> 47:29.440]  The left is on every publication they
[47:29.440 --> 47:31.440]  own to TV shows, dramas,
[47:31.440 --> 47:33.440]  plays, saying kill the
[47:33.440 --> 47:35.440]  president, kill his family, kill his supporters
[47:35.440 --> 47:37.440]  and people are getting beat up in the head
[47:37.440 --> 47:39.440]  with clubs, with bike
[47:39.440 --> 47:41.440]  locks, they're getting stabbed.
[47:41.440 --> 47:43.440]  It's happening everywhere.
[47:43.440 --> 47:45.440]  The Islamists know this is their time.
[47:45.440 --> 47:47.440]  There were two more Islamist attacks in
[47:47.440 --> 47:49.440]  England and France today.
[47:49.440 --> 47:51.440]  People running folks over with cars, stabbing
[47:51.440 --> 47:53.440]  people.
[47:53.440 --> 47:55.440]  The leftists are activating, stabbing
[47:55.440 --> 47:57.440]  patriot activists in
[47:57.440 --> 47:59.440]  places like New York and in California
[47:59.440 --> 48:01.440]  today.
[48:01.440 --> 48:03.440]  We are seeing communists here in Austin
[48:03.440 --> 48:05.440]  openly attacking our camera crew
[48:05.440 --> 48:07.440]  and our reporters and having
[48:07.440 --> 48:09.440]  semi-automatic rifles with their fingers
[48:09.440 --> 48:11.440]  on the triggers. I mean, they are
[48:11.440 --> 48:13.440]  ready to go. They are ready to bring
[48:13.440 --> 48:15.440]  in the civil emergency.
[48:15.440 --> 48:17.440]  And if we act like cowards during the civil
[48:17.440 --> 48:19.440]  emergency and let Soros dictate
[48:19.440 --> 48:21.440]  like Ukraine and like
[48:21.440 --> 48:23.440]  the Arab Spring, step down Trump
[48:23.440 --> 48:25.440]  and we'll stop burning cities. If our
[48:25.440 --> 48:27.440]  military and our police and our citizenry
[48:27.440 --> 48:29.440]  don't then offensively
[48:29.440 --> 48:31.440]  in a defensive move, in a
[48:31.440 --> 48:33.440]  counter-move, politically
[48:33.440 --> 48:35.440]  get back in their faces and also defend
[48:35.440 --> 48:37.440]  ourselves from physical attacks,
[48:37.440 --> 48:39.440]  they will intimidate the nation into
[48:39.440 --> 48:41.440]  a new dark age.
[48:41.440 --> 48:43.440]  Think Bolshevik Revolution
[48:43.440 --> 48:45.440]  1917, but Americana style.
[48:45.440 --> 48:47.440]  They believe this is their time.
[48:47.440 --> 48:49.440]  They're making their move.
[48:49.440 --> 48:51.440]  Here is Colonel Shaffer,
[48:51.440 --> 48:53.440]  black ops dialed into everything
[48:53.440 --> 48:55.440]  telling you exactly what I've been
[48:55.440 --> 48:57.440]  laying out for a while. They're planning
[48:57.440 --> 48:59.440]  for a COG emergency after
[48:59.440 --> 49:01.440]  they start a civil war. We're
[49:01.440 --> 49:03.440]  in a total war, an information war.
[49:03.440 --> 49:05.440]  We're trying to bring our president down. Here's the clip.
[49:05.440 --> 49:07.440]  This is the issue.
[49:07.440 --> 49:09.440]  If the governments who are responsible
[49:09.440 --> 49:11.440]  for our common, well for our common good
[49:11.440 --> 49:13.440]  and defense are shown to
[49:13.440 --> 49:15.440]  be an effective people on the
[49:15.440 --> 49:17.440]  opposite side are going to rise up.
[49:17.440 --> 49:19.440]  So what you see here is
[49:19.440 --> 49:21.440]  the automatic response, force
[49:21.440 --> 49:23.440]  on force of certain folks coming
[49:23.440 --> 49:25.440]  back to essentially create
[49:25.440 --> 49:27.440]  to retaliate. So
[49:27.440 --> 49:29.440]  again, the pathology is clear.
[49:29.440 --> 49:31.440]  If one side begins to act
[49:31.440 --> 49:33.440]  violently, you have inevitably the other
[49:33.440 --> 49:35.440]  side starting to come back. It always
[49:35.440 --> 49:37.440]  happens. So we have to understand
[49:37.440 --> 49:39.440]  if the government does not stop
[49:39.440 --> 49:41.440]  the violence on the left, you'll see more violence
[49:41.440 --> 49:43.440]  on the right and retaliation. It's inevitable.
[49:43.440 --> 49:45.440]  Colonel, you fight in war
[49:45.440 --> 49:47.440]  zones. People are getting way too
[49:47.440 --> 49:49.440]  crazy about politics. These are
[49:49.440 --> 49:51.440]  a difference in philosophy. You shouldn't
[49:51.440 --> 49:53.440]  be shooting at each other and trying to stab
[49:53.440 --> 49:55.440]  each other, rushing in stages.
[49:55.440 --> 49:57.440]  You've got to control. Hopefully people,
[49:57.440 --> 49:59.440]  rational people will dial it back.
[49:59.440 --> 50:01.440]  Hopefully. I didn't think I'd have to tap into
[50:01.440 --> 50:03.440]  your terrorism knowledge for these segments, but
[50:03.440 --> 50:05.440]  sadly we do.
[50:05.440 --> 50:07.440]  We should get that clip from a month ago.
[50:07.440 --> 50:09.440]  We wrote an article about it where he said
[50:09.440 --> 50:11.440]  there's an information war against the president.
[50:11.440 --> 50:13.440]  This is a deep state war trying to overthrow the president.
[50:13.440 --> 50:15.440]  We should take that clip with that clip and put it together
[50:15.440 --> 50:17.440]  because here's the problem.
[50:17.440 --> 50:19.440]  It's totally authorized
[50:19.440 --> 50:21.440]  when they're doing a simulated murder of the president
[50:21.440 --> 50:23.440]  and pushing it to get other people to do it
[50:23.440 --> 50:25.440]  at a government funded event
[50:25.440 --> 50:27.440]  when the left's rushing the stage and taking
[50:27.440 --> 50:29.440]  over everywhere else to then rush the stage
[50:29.440 --> 50:31.440]  and say no more political violence, stop
[50:31.440 --> 50:33.440]  shooting members of Congress, stop shooting cops
[50:33.440 --> 50:35.440]  in the back. The left is 99%
[50:35.440 --> 50:37.440]  of this violence. So when the threat
[50:37.440 --> 50:39.440]  continue them, we're just using information
[50:39.440 --> 50:41.440]  war to try to stop their physical attack
[50:41.440 --> 50:43.440]  because if we don't do that
[50:43.440 --> 50:45.440]  it's going to then break into physical
[50:45.440 --> 50:47.440]  violence. I'm encouraging people to hold
[50:47.440 --> 50:49.440]  the line like
[50:49.440 --> 50:51.440]  Gandhi or Martin Luther King
[50:51.440 --> 50:53.440]  and not offensively strike back
[50:53.440 --> 50:55.440]  because it's politically hurting the left.
[50:55.440 --> 50:57.440]  But then if they launch a full offensive
[50:57.440 --> 50:59.440]  then we've got to really launch back
[50:59.440 --> 51:25.440]  physically.

[54:28.440 --> 54:30.440]  So,
[54:30.440 --> 54:32.440]  Megan Kelly has totally flopped.
[54:32.440 --> 54:34.440]  She has the lowest ratings in the history of
[54:34.440 --> 54:36.440]  NBC's Dateline.
[54:36.440 --> 54:38.440]  And now we learned the lowest ratings
[54:38.440 --> 54:40.440]  in all the broadcast TV slots
[54:40.440 --> 54:42.440]  according to Nielsen ratings that was picked up
[54:42.440 --> 54:44.440]  by The Daily Mail.
[54:44.440 --> 54:45.440]  So folks would ask then,
[54:45.440 --> 54:46.440]  why are we still covering it?
[54:46.440 --> 54:48.440]  Because they threw everything they had at us.
[54:48.440 --> 54:50.440]  They edited it. They twisted it.
[54:50.440 --> 54:51.440]  They took it out of context.
[54:51.440 --> 54:53.440]  We're going to be releasing the full interview
[54:53.440 --> 54:56.440]  very, very soon at the end of the week.
[54:56.440 --> 54:58.440]  But,
[54:58.440 --> 55:01.440]  the big issue here is what are they going to do now?
[55:01.440 --> 55:04.440]  Shepard from that, Sean Hannity,
[55:04.440 --> 55:07.440]  who broke down the fact that Ted Coppel
[55:09.440 --> 55:11.440]  came out
[55:11.440 --> 55:13.440]  with that interview
[55:13.440 --> 55:15.440]  last year
[55:15.440 --> 55:17.440]  where he basically edited
[55:17.440 --> 55:19.440]  Sean Hannity together
[55:19.440 --> 55:20.440]  extremely deceptively.
[55:20.440 --> 55:22.440]  And so Hannity has said it's now time
[55:22.440 --> 55:25.440]  to release the tapes
[55:25.440 --> 55:26.440]  of the Alec Jones interview
[55:26.440 --> 55:27.440]  and let the American people decide.
[55:27.440 --> 55:29.440]  He's not attacking Megan Kelly.
[55:29.440 --> 55:30.440]  He's being very friendly about it.
[55:30.440 --> 55:32.440]  He's saying, let's just let
[55:32.440 --> 55:33.440]  the American people decide.
[55:33.440 --> 55:34.440]  And that's exactly what I said.
[55:34.440 --> 55:38.440]  Release it on NBC News website.
[55:38.440 --> 55:39.440]  And then people can see
[55:39.440 --> 55:41.440]  what the producers really did.
[55:41.440 --> 55:44.440]  Here it is.
[55:44.440 --> 55:46.440]  All right, so during last night's interview,
[55:46.440 --> 55:48.440]  NBC News host Megan Kelly, my former colleague,
[55:48.440 --> 55:51.440]  pressed Jones on some of his conspiracy theories.
[55:51.440 --> 55:53.440]  But out of the hours of video,
[55:53.440 --> 55:55.440]  apparently they taped, NBC only aired
[55:55.440 --> 55:56.440]  a few minutes of it.
[55:56.440 --> 55:58.440]  Now Jones has called for NBC
[55:58.440 --> 56:00.440]  to release the full unedited version
[56:00.440 --> 56:01.440]  of the interview.
[56:01.440 --> 56:03.440]  And by the way, in this case,
[56:03.440 --> 56:04.440]  I have to agree.
[56:04.440 --> 56:05.440]  Whether you agree or disagree with them,
[56:05.440 --> 56:07.440]  this is the right thing to do.
[56:07.440 --> 56:08.440]  Now I want to be very clear.
[56:08.440 --> 56:10.440]  I am in no way,
[56:10.440 --> 56:12.440]  as some on social media have suggested,
[56:12.440 --> 56:14.440]  being critical of my colleague
[56:14.440 --> 56:15.440]  and somebody who I've been friends with,
[56:15.440 --> 56:16.440]  Megan Kelly.
[56:16.440 --> 56:18.440]  She is a journalist who is doing her job.
[56:18.440 --> 56:21.440]  But I do believe NBC News
[56:21.440 --> 56:23.440]  should release the tapes,
[56:23.440 --> 56:25.440]  the full tapes of the Alex Jones interview,
[56:25.440 --> 56:26.440]  let Americans decide.
[56:26.440 --> 56:28.440]  Isn't that what websites are now for?
[56:28.440 --> 56:31.440]  Shouldn't NBC let you, the American public,
[56:31.440 --> 56:33.440]  see everything that was said,
[56:33.440 --> 56:35.440]  and then they can decide for themselves
[56:35.440 --> 56:36.440]  what to think.
[56:36.440 --> 56:38.440]  Now, I say this because I'm a little sick
[56:38.440 --> 56:40.440]  and tired of the mainstream media.
[56:40.440 --> 56:42.440]  News media editing interviews to fit
[56:42.440 --> 56:44.440]  a predetermined narrative.
[56:44.440 --> 56:46.440]  Again, I'm not saying Megan Kelly did this.
[56:46.440 --> 56:47.440]  As a matter of fact, I know she didn't.
[56:47.440 --> 56:49.440]  And I really do hate to disappoint
[56:49.440 --> 56:50.440]  all of you people in the media
[56:50.440 --> 56:52.440]  that would love to see a battle and fight
[56:52.440 --> 56:54.440]  break out between Megan Kelly.
[56:54.440 --> 56:55.440]  That's not happening.
[56:55.440 --> 56:57.440]  So I truly wish her the best.
[56:57.440 --> 56:59.440]  But you may remember,
[56:59.440 --> 57:01.440]  just a few months ago, back in March,
[57:01.440 --> 57:04.440]  I was the focus of fake edited news.
[57:04.440 --> 57:06.440]  I had agreed to do an interview with CBS
[57:06.440 --> 57:08.440]  in their Sunday morning program
[57:08.440 --> 57:10.440]  in their special contributor, Ted Koppel.
[57:10.440 --> 57:12.440]  The interview lasted nearly 50 minutes,
[57:12.440 --> 57:14.440]  as we discussed in great detail,
[57:14.440 --> 57:16.440]  great specificity, many, many things,
[57:16.440 --> 57:18.440]  why there's such a great divide
[57:18.440 --> 57:20.440]  in America, politics, and media.
[57:20.440 --> 57:21.440]  The interview airs.
[57:21.440 --> 57:25.440]  I get 70 seconds of that interview cut down.
[57:25.440 --> 57:28.440]  Afterwards, I called for CBS to release the full video,
[57:28.440 --> 57:30.440]  which of course they refused to do.
[57:30.440 --> 57:32.440]  And that brings us to tonight's question of the day.
[57:32.440 --> 57:34.440]  Should NBC release the tapes,
[57:34.440 --> 57:36.440]  especially in the day and age,
[57:36.440 --> 57:39.440]  where all of these news organizations have websites?
[57:39.440 --> 57:41.440]  All I gotta do is put it up there.
[57:41.440 --> 57:43.440]  I'm gonna play the whole segment from Fox.
[57:43.440 --> 57:45.440]  I never do that, but we're the subject of it,
[57:45.440 --> 57:46.440]  so we can be a fair use.
[57:46.440 --> 57:48.440]  I don't think Kennedy has a problem,
[57:48.440 --> 57:50.440]  because he's one of the only real journalists left
[57:50.440 --> 57:52.440]  on broadcast and cable television,
[57:52.440 --> 57:54.440]  because he is on some broadcast,
[57:54.440 --> 57:56.440]  Fox stations around the country broadcast as well.
[57:56.440 --> 57:58.440]  Very popular show, but five million viewers,
[57:58.440 --> 58:00.440]  just on cable alone,
[58:00.440 --> 58:02.440]  another five million or so on other stations.
[58:02.440 --> 58:04.440]  So he is the king of cable news.
[58:04.440 --> 58:07.440]  They try to spin it and say it's Rachel Maddow.
[58:07.440 --> 58:10.440]  But the larger point here is that
[58:10.440 --> 58:12.440]  that's what websites are for,
[58:12.440 --> 58:14.440]  and you'd have more ratings and more listeners,
[58:14.440 --> 58:16.440]  and people would do interviews then and then trust you.
[58:16.440 --> 58:18.440]  Okay, put out your edited version on the big broadcast,
[58:18.440 --> 58:21.440]  but on the internet, put out the raw
[58:21.440 --> 58:23.440]  100 plus minute interview we did.
[58:23.440 --> 58:25.440]  That was just one of four interviews.
[58:25.440 --> 58:27.440]  We did one in the hallway, one in the control room,
[58:27.440 --> 58:29.440]  one in here, one in the car, one in the,
[58:29.440 --> 58:30.440]  at the restaurant.
[58:30.440 --> 58:32.440]  Okay, that's more than four interviews.
[58:32.440 --> 58:35.440]  We did like five, six interviews.
[58:35.440 --> 58:37.440]  Just released the one big sit-down,
[58:37.440 --> 58:39.440]  and here what I really had to say.
[58:39.440 --> 58:41.440]  Hour number two, straight ahead, live,
[58:41.440 --> 58:43.440]  uncensored, unfiltered, it's the info war.

[58:52.440 --> 58:54.440]  We've taken thousands of years of known research
[58:54.440 --> 58:56.440]  and put it together with our own four years
[58:56.440 --> 58:59.440]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems
[58:59.440 --> 59:01.440]  that God gave us through Mother Nature
[59:01.440 --> 59:02.440]  to detoxify the body.
[59:02.440 --> 59:04.440]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield.
[59:04.440 --> 59:07.440]  Toxic, metal, and chemical defense support.
[59:07.440 --> 59:09.440]  It's made in the USA.
[59:09.440 --> 59:11.440]  It's filled with known compounds from nature
[59:11.440 --> 59:14.440]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[59:14.440 --> 59:16.440]  and it supports the info war.
[59:16.440 --> 59:18.440]  It is a classical 360 win.
[59:18.440 --> 59:20.440]  This is the formula that I personally
[59:20.440 --> 59:22.440]  have been taking for over a year,
[59:22.440 --> 59:25.440]  and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[59:25.440 --> 59:28.440]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[59:28.440 --> 59:30.440]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family,
[59:30.440 --> 59:33.440]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[59:33.440 --> 59:35.440]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean
[59:35.440 --> 59:37.440]  and as focused as you can be
[59:37.440 --> 59:40.440]  because we need you, the remnant of America,
[59:40.440 --> 59:42.440]  to reignite those rush fires to the next level
[59:42.440 --> 59:44.440]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[59:44.440 --> 59:46.440]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together,
[59:46.440 --> 59:48.440]  we're changing the world.
[59:48.440 --> 59:49.440]  Now it's time to change our bodies
[59:49.440 --> 59:52.440]  with ZShield and infowarslife.com.
[59:52.440 --> 1:00:16.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:16.440 --> 1:00:18.440]  Live from Austin, Texas,
[1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:23.440]  Broadcasting World Wide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:23.440 --> 1:00:49.440]  Wow, it's crazy to see Sean Hannity on the same page
[1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:52.440]  with me about the fact that if they have big news sites
[1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:54.440]  that they were on for a couple of weeks ago,
[1:00:54.440 --> 1:00:56.440]  not talk to Sean Hannity in March,
[1:00:56.440 --> 1:00:58.440]  Ted Coppel for CBS, for 50 minutes,
[1:00:58.440 --> 1:01:00.440]  and then it's 70 seconds,
[1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:03.440]  imagine 110 minutes
[1:01:03.440 --> 1:01:06.440]  was how long I sat down
[1:01:06.440 --> 1:01:09.440]  for the fifth interview or whatever it was
[1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:11.440]  with Megan Kelly,
[1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:13.440]  and then they have a 19-minute piece
[1:01:13.440 --> 1:01:15.440]  and I'm on there about two minutes
[1:01:15.440 --> 1:01:17.440]  and I know it's edited together garbage
[1:01:17.440 --> 1:01:19.440]  because I have the tapes.
[1:01:19.440 --> 1:01:21.440]  People say, well, then release the tapes.
[1:01:21.440 --> 1:01:24.440]  We're going to.
[1:01:24.440 --> 1:01:26.440]  But I have a limited crew
[1:01:26.440 --> 1:01:29.440]  and I'm going to make sure they're hard-hitting
[1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:32.440]  because we're going to show the clips from the show
[1:01:32.440 --> 1:01:34.440]  where she edited me together
[1:01:34.440 --> 1:01:36.440]  and then we're going to say,
[1:01:36.440 --> 1:01:38.440]  here's where she edited me together.
[1:01:38.440 --> 1:01:41.440]  Now, here's from this point on the tape, unedited.
[1:01:41.440 --> 1:01:43.440]  Here's where she edited this together.
[1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:45.440]  It's from this point in the tape
[1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:47.440]  and this point in the tape.
[1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:49.440]  We're going to show timelines.
[1:01:49.440 --> 1:01:51.440]  We're going to show work.
[1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:53.440]  It's like a documentary.
[1:01:53.440 --> 1:01:55.440]  I'm not going to just throw the tapes out.
[1:01:55.440 --> 1:01:57.440]  I've decided I am going to show you
[1:01:57.440 --> 1:01:59.440]  how they engage in this manipulation.
[1:01:59.440 --> 1:02:02.440]  Remember, Katie Couric got sued
[1:02:02.440 --> 1:02:05.440]  because she had a, quote,
[1:02:05.440 --> 1:02:08.440]  focus group, a panel of gun owners
[1:02:08.440 --> 1:02:10.440]  and she was asking questions like,
[1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:13.440]  give me one example where guns do something good.
[1:02:13.440 --> 1:02:16.440]  And of course, they all gave great answers
[1:02:16.440 --> 1:02:18.440]  because they were sitting there taping it.
[1:02:18.440 --> 1:02:20.440]  So they'd cut to the woman going,
[1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:23.440]  like she was watching paint dry or daydreaming.
[1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:25.440]  They cut to the guy.
[1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:27.440]  He's like, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:29.440]  And what they do is they aim cameras at you
[1:02:29.440 --> 1:02:31.440]  and say, we're just getting some room sound.
[1:02:31.440 --> 1:02:33.440]  Just sit there like you're doing nothing.
[1:02:33.440 --> 1:02:36.440]  Then they run the camera for a few minutes on each person.
[1:02:36.440 --> 1:02:40.440]  Now they got cutaway shots to make you look like buffoons.
[1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:42.440]  Gun rights groups suing Katie Couric,
[1:02:42.440 --> 1:02:46.440]  others involved with under-the-gun documentary.
[1:02:46.440 --> 1:02:50.440]  Katie Couric responds under-the-gun controversy.
[1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:53.440]  Now, you notice Handy's taking the high road,
[1:02:53.440 --> 1:02:55.440]  a little lady, Megan, and other friends.
[1:02:55.440 --> 1:02:58.440]  She was saying nice things about him when she was here.
[1:02:58.440 --> 1:03:00.440]  And I'm sure it's true that she went into the interview
[1:03:00.440 --> 1:03:02.440]  and then they edited it.
[1:03:02.440 --> 1:03:05.440]  But definitely the kind of stuff
[1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:09.440]  that this gun rights group sued over has already happened here.
[1:03:09.440 --> 1:03:14.440]  Deception, manipulation,
[1:03:14.440 --> 1:03:17.440]  misrepresentation.
[1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:20.440]  I mean, I've got her for 25, 30 minutes going,
[1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:21.440]  oh, I'm obsessed with you.
[1:03:21.440 --> 1:03:22.440]  Oh, it's not a hit piece.
[1:03:22.440 --> 1:03:23.440]  Oh, I think you're a good guy.
[1:03:23.440 --> 1:03:25.440]  Oh, I promise it's not a gotcha piece.
[1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:26.440]  I promise it's not a hit piece.
[1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:33.440]  And then it's the worst hit piece the Earth has ever seen.
[1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:37.440]  With me all with hot lamps all around me and, you know,
[1:03:37.440 --> 1:03:40.440]  lit from below and just incoherent garbage.
[1:03:40.440 --> 1:03:42.440]  I'm done talking about that for now.
[1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:44.440]  I'm going to air the whole segment from Hannity
[1:03:44.440 --> 1:03:47.440]  because I think it's something everybody
[1:03:47.440 --> 1:03:49.440]  should really be debating and discussing here
[1:03:49.440 --> 1:03:51.440]  and that we should start demanding from the networks.
[1:03:51.440 --> 1:03:54.440]  Hey, you've got unlimited bandwidth, unlimited space.
[1:03:54.440 --> 1:03:55.440]  You'll get a lot of views.
[1:03:55.440 --> 1:03:56.440]  People want raw interviews.
[1:03:56.440 --> 1:03:58.440]  It's what they're after.
[1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:03.440]  Why would you not put out your edited 19-minute piece
[1:04:03.440 --> 1:04:05.440]  and then after, so it doesn't compete with it,
[1:04:05.440 --> 1:04:09.440]  put out at least large chunks that's unedited.
[1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:11.440]  But they can't put out two-minute chunks,
[1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:14.440]  five-minute chunks, 10-minute chunks
[1:04:14.440 --> 1:04:18.440]  because it would be coherent.
[1:04:18.440 --> 1:04:20.440]  Instead, you watch that piece.
[1:04:20.440 --> 1:04:22.440]  It sounds like I'm a gibbering idiot.
[1:04:22.440 --> 1:04:24.440]  And I talked to Nico and others that were there.
[1:04:24.440 --> 1:04:25.440]  I was tired.
[1:04:25.440 --> 1:04:27.440]  I've been interviewed off and on for 12 hours.
[1:04:27.440 --> 1:04:30.440]  And so there were a few times that I gibbered or stammered,
[1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:32.440]  but that was only a few times.
[1:04:32.440 --> 1:04:33.440]  It was taken out of context.
[1:04:33.440 --> 1:04:35.440]  And quite frankly, I'm so sick of Megan Kelly
[1:04:35.440 --> 1:04:37.440]  and so sick of the globalists.
[1:04:37.440 --> 1:04:39.440]  I didn't even have butterflies during it.
[1:04:39.440 --> 1:04:42.440]  I was just so sick of the same stupid, twisted questions
[1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:46.440]  and got you answers and just all the games they were playing.
[1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:50.440]  But again, regardless of how bad I did,
[1:04:50.440 --> 1:04:52.440]  I'll say I didn't do too good.
[1:04:52.440 --> 1:04:53.440]  People are saying I'm a genius.
[1:04:53.440 --> 1:04:54.440]  No, I didn't do too good.
[1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:55.440]  It doesn't matter.
[1:04:55.440 --> 1:04:58.440]  People hate MSM so bad and they're so sick of it,
[1:04:58.440 --> 1:05:10.440]  I've been raised up on people's shoulders.
[1:05:29.440 --> 1:05:32.440]  And you can donate to Foreman's Emergency Medical Fund
[1:05:32.440 --> 1:05:33.440]  at Wesearcher.
[1:05:33.440 --> 1:05:35.440]  Santa Monica police are treating the attack
[1:05:35.440 --> 1:05:36.440]  as racially motivated,
[1:05:36.440 --> 1:05:38.440]  but we've seen the many statements from Tim Kaine
[1:05:38.440 --> 1:05:40.440]  calling for fights in the streets
[1:05:40.440 --> 1:05:42.440]  to Loretta Lynch calling for marching blood
[1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:43.440]  and death in the streets.
[1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:46.440]  Democratic leaders across the country,
[1:05:46.440 --> 1:05:47.440]  from Bernie Sanders to Hillary Clinton
[1:05:47.440 --> 1:05:49.440]  to Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi,
[1:05:49.440 --> 1:05:51.440]  are all calling for people to rise up
[1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:54.440]  and resist this summer during the summer of rage.
[1:05:54.440 --> 1:05:56.440]  Who will be the next victim?
[1:05:56.440 --> 1:05:58.440]  Watch your back or it may be you.
[1:05:58.440 --> 1:06:00.440]  Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com
[1:06:00.440 --> 1:06:02.440]  and Infowars Nightly News.
[1:06:06.440 --> 1:06:07.440]  Let's go to Devin and Florida.
[1:06:07.440 --> 1:06:09.440]  Devin and Florida, you're on the air.
[1:06:09.440 --> 1:06:10.440]  Great.
[1:06:10.440 --> 1:06:11.440]  Hey, thank you so much.
[1:06:11.440 --> 1:06:14.440]  Listen, I have bought your product
[1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:15.440]  and I gotta say they're amazing.
[1:06:15.440 --> 1:06:16.440]  Thank you.
[1:06:16.440 --> 1:06:17.440]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it
[1:06:17.440 --> 1:06:19.440]  because I've got caveman,
[1:06:19.440 --> 1:06:21.440]  Superman of vitality,
[1:06:21.440 --> 1:06:22.440]  secret swells,
[1:06:22.440 --> 1:06:23.440]  five-minute interfusion.
[1:06:23.440 --> 1:06:25.440]  I've got the body armor.
[1:06:25.440 --> 1:06:26.440]  Wow, thank you.
[1:06:26.440 --> 1:06:28.440]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:30.440]  Which pharmaceutical does you like best?
[1:06:30.440 --> 1:06:33.440]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion, to be honest.
[1:06:33.440 --> 1:06:34.440]  That's amazing.
[1:06:34.440 --> 1:06:35.440]  That's really incredible.
[1:06:35.440 --> 1:06:37.440]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you,
[1:06:37.440 --> 1:06:38.440]  I felt incredible.
[1:06:38.440 --> 1:06:39.440]  I haven't felt it this week.
[1:06:39.440 --> 1:06:41.440]  My morning was fantastic
[1:06:41.440 --> 1:06:42.440]  and I love you guys.
[1:06:42.440 --> 1:06:44.440]  I love the Infowars crew
[1:06:44.440 --> 1:06:46.440]  and I just want to, yeah,
[1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:48.440]  I want to take this opportunity
[1:06:48.440 --> 1:06:50.440]  to tell anybody out there who's on the fence,
[1:06:50.440 --> 1:06:51.440]  just buy it.
[1:06:51.440 --> 1:06:52.440]  You will love it.
[1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:54.440]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.

[1:07:32.440 --> 1:07:34.440]  without the headaches and heartburn
[1:07:34.440 --> 1:07:36.440]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[1:07:36.440 --> 1:07:38.440]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee
[1:07:38.440 --> 1:07:40.440]  and it's taken us years to secure connections
[1:07:40.440 --> 1:07:43.440]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:44.440]  Dropped by the site today,

[1:08:11.440 --> 1:08:13.440]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[1:08:13.440 --> 1:08:15.440]  you are the resistance.
[1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:36.440]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:08:36.440 --> 1:08:37.440]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:39.440]  for the next 30 minutes, my good buddy
[1:08:39.440 --> 1:08:42.440]  and of course Infowars.com contributor, Joe Biggs,
[1:08:42.440 --> 1:08:45.440]  former Army Sergeant, Patriot,
[1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:47.440]  is going to give us his take on leftist stabbings
[1:08:47.440 --> 1:08:49.440]  all over the United States and Europe.
[1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:51.440]  We have more stabbings, more truck attacks
[1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:54.440]  in England and in France today
[1:08:54.440 --> 1:08:56.440]  by the loving Jihadis.
[1:08:56.440 --> 1:09:00.440]  And a friend of Joe Biggs got stabbed last night.
[1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:01.440]  They screamed,
[1:09:01.440 --> 1:09:03.440]  white boy, going to get shanked
[1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:05.440]  because he had, well,
[1:09:05.440 --> 1:09:07.440]  there's a photo here of him
[1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:08.440]  in a Hillary for prison shirt
[1:09:08.440 --> 1:09:10.440]  and he had conservative stickers
[1:09:10.440 --> 1:09:12.440]  and Trump stickers on his car.
[1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:14.440]  We're going to be talking about that here
[1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:16.440]  in just a moment.
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:18.440]  And that ties in to
[1:09:18.440 --> 1:09:21.440]  Colonel Shaffer warns a bloody civil war,
[1:09:21.440 --> 1:09:23.440]  societal collapse.
[1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:25.440]  That was last night.
[1:09:25.440 --> 1:09:27.440]  A month ago, he warned that the deep state
[1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:29.440]  is trying to overthrow Trump
[1:09:29.440 --> 1:09:31.440]  and trying to cause this civil war.
[1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:33.440]  And then that ties in
[1:09:33.440 --> 1:09:36.440]  to this entire stack of news
[1:09:36.440 --> 1:09:38.440]  that I've got right here.
[1:09:38.440 --> 1:09:40.440]  Tucker takes on Democratic strategist
[1:09:40.440 --> 1:09:41.440]  who tweeted,
[1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:44.440]  hunt Republican Congressman hashtag
[1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:46.440]  after this police shooting.
[1:09:46.440 --> 1:09:48.440]  This is a high level Democrat
[1:09:48.440 --> 1:09:50.440]  saying, let's go after more people.
[1:09:50.440 --> 1:09:52.440]  The Huffington Post writers
[1:09:52.440 --> 1:09:55.440]  made jokes about the man
[1:09:55.440 --> 1:09:58.440]  that died in North Korea, Otto Warmbier.
[1:09:58.440 --> 1:10:00.440]  They said, hey, he's white.
[1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:01.440]  He's privileged.
[1:10:01.440 --> 1:10:03.440]  I'm going to play that coming up in the hour.
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:05.440]  He's a frat boy.
[1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:07.440]  To see that there's this weird alliance
[1:10:07.440 --> 1:10:09.440]  in the authoritarian regime.
[1:10:09.440 --> 1:10:12.440]  No matter how hellish it is with these trendies.
[1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:14.440]  Continuing,
[1:10:14.440 --> 1:10:16.440]  Bernie Sanders urged supporters to act
[1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:18.440]  in unprecedented way to stop Republicans
[1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:20.440]  by any means necessary.
[1:10:20.440 --> 1:10:22.440]  And of course, you've seen supporters out shooting
[1:10:22.440 --> 1:10:24.440]  and trying to kill people.
[1:10:24.440 --> 1:10:26.440]  UN report, number of global refugees,
[1:10:26.440 --> 1:10:28.440]  that means Muslim men, hits record high.
[1:10:28.440 --> 1:10:30.440]  More than 10 million people in 2016
[1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:32.440]  traveling to the West.
[1:10:32.440 --> 1:10:34.440]  Niceman drives its children at Kent,
[1:10:34.440 --> 1:10:36.440]  former military base.
[1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:38.440]  Armed police on the scene,
[1:10:38.440 --> 1:10:40.440]  stopping as he screams Allah Akbar
[1:10:40.440 --> 1:10:42.440]  and tries to stab people.
[1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:44.440]  Report, terrorist rams into police car
[1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:46.440]  in boxed attack in Paris.
[1:10:46.440 --> 1:10:48.440]  Same thing.
[1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:50.440]  First driver death in Calis
[1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:52.440]  after migrants drag
[1:10:52.440 --> 1:10:54.440]  tree trunks onto the motorway.
[1:10:54.440 --> 1:10:56.440]  They routinely rob the trucks
[1:10:56.440 --> 1:10:58.440]  on their way to the English Channel Tunnel
[1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:00.440]  and pull the drivers out and rob them.
[1:11:00.440 --> 1:11:02.440]  There's thousands of videos of that on YouTube,
[1:11:02.440 --> 1:11:04.440]  but this guy got killed.
[1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:06.440]  They're saying it's the first death.
[1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:08.440]  Infidel should have their throats cut.
[1:11:08.440 --> 1:11:10.440]  Italy arrest Iraqi refugees
[1:11:10.440 --> 1:11:12.440]  over ISIS support.
[1:11:12.440 --> 1:11:14.440]  Terror flags wave openly in the streets
[1:11:14.440 --> 1:11:16.440]  of London. That's CNS news.
[1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:18.440]  Murder of Muslim girl
[1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:20.440]  blamed on Trump was committed
[1:11:20.440 --> 1:11:22.440]  by an illegal immigrant.
[1:11:22.440 --> 1:11:24.440]  Think about a control the media
[1:11:24.440 --> 1:11:26.440]  as a Paul Joseph Watson article
[1:11:26.440 --> 1:11:28.440]  on infowars.com.
[1:11:28.440 --> 1:11:30.440]  An illegal alien kills
[1:11:30.440 --> 1:11:32.440]  a Muslim girl
[1:11:32.440 --> 1:11:34.440]  and then they say, look, it's a terror
[1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:36.440]  attack on Muslims
[1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:38.440]  because of Trump's hate.
[1:11:38.440 --> 1:11:40.440]  But really, it's just another
[1:11:40.440 --> 1:11:42.440]  illegal alien
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:44.440]  killing somebody.
[1:11:44.440 --> 1:11:46.440]  Murder of Muslim girl
[1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:48.440]  blamed on Trump was committed by an illegal immigrant.
[1:11:48.440 --> 1:11:50.440]  President held responsible for death.
[1:11:50.440 --> 1:11:52.440]  His border policy may have prevented
[1:11:52.440 --> 1:11:54.440]  the murder of an American Muslim
[1:11:54.440 --> 1:11:56.440]  teen in Virginia that left his blame
[1:11:56.440 --> 1:11:58.440]  on Donald Trump was actually committed
[1:11:58.440 --> 1:12:00.440]  by an illegal immigrant. As soon as the fact
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:02.440]  of the story became known, that was suddenly
[1:12:02.440 --> 1:12:04.440]  lost all interest in the case. I wonder why.
[1:12:04.440 --> 1:12:06.440]  17 year old
[1:12:06.440 --> 1:12:08.440]  Nabra Hashim
[1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:10.440]  was killed during an incident on Sunday
[1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:12.440]  when Darwin Martinez Torres
[1:12:12.440 --> 1:12:14.440]  drove up a curve
[1:12:14.440 --> 1:12:16.440]  towards a group of about 15 teens
[1:12:16.440 --> 1:12:18.440]  who were walking in Fairfax County after participating
[1:12:18.440 --> 1:12:20.440]  in an event at all Dulles
[1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:22.440]  area Muslim society.
[1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:24.440]  Torres became enraged after arguing
[1:12:24.440 --> 1:12:26.440]  with one of the teens on a bike before leaving
[1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:28.440]  his vehicle and chasing the group with a baseball bat.
[1:12:28.440 --> 1:12:30.440]  The suspect caught her
[1:12:30.440 --> 1:12:32.440]  and hit her with a bat
[1:12:32.440 --> 1:12:34.440]  before taking her body into an unknown location
[1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:36.440]  in Loudoun County.
[1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:38.440]  And then it goes on from there.
[1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:40.440]  And our only issue is
[1:12:40.440 --> 1:12:42.440]  there are a lot of mentally ill people and a lot of criminals
[1:12:42.440 --> 1:12:44.440]  that come in out of Latin America already fleeing
[1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:46.440]  justice. Just like folks used to run
[1:12:46.440 --> 1:12:48.440]  in Latin America from justice here.
[1:12:48.440 --> 1:12:50.440]  And then they're above the law. They can commit crimes over
[1:12:50.440 --> 1:12:52.440]  and over again and the courts basically see
[1:12:52.440 --> 1:12:54.440]  them as above the law. Why is
[1:12:54.440 --> 1:12:56.440]  that the case?
[1:12:56.440 --> 1:12:58.440]  I'm not trying to just single out Muslims or anybody here.
[1:12:58.440 --> 1:13:00.440]  But the fact is the media
[1:13:00.440 --> 1:13:02.440]  continues to try to cover things up
[1:13:02.440 --> 1:13:04.440]  and spin things.
[1:13:04.440 --> 1:13:06.440]  And is openly trying to push us into a civil war.
[1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:08.440]  Here's a clip
[1:13:08.440 --> 1:13:10.440]  again that I played last hour of Colonel Shaffer
[1:13:10.440 --> 1:13:12.440]  warning about this on Fox News.
[1:13:12.440 --> 1:13:14.440]  This is the issue.
[1:13:14.440 --> 1:13:16.440]  If the governments who are responsible for
[1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:18.440]  our common welfare, common good
[1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:20.440]  and defense are shown to be
[1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:22.440]  an effective people on the opposite
[1:13:22.440 --> 1:13:24.440]  side are going to rise up.
[1:13:24.440 --> 1:13:26.440]  What you see here is the automatic
[1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:28.440]  response, force on force
[1:13:28.440 --> 1:13:30.440]  of certain folks coming back
[1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:32.440]  to essentially create
[1:13:32.440 --> 1:13:34.440]  to retaliate. So again
[1:13:34.440 --> 1:13:36.440]  the pathology is clear.
[1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:38.440]  If one side begins to act violently
[1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:40.440]  you have inevitably the other side
[1:13:40.440 --> 1:13:42.440]  starting to come back. It always happens.
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:44.440]  So we have to understand if the government
[1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:46.440]  does not stop the violence
[1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:48.440]  on the left, you'll see more violence on the right
[1:13:48.440 --> 1:13:50.440]  and retaliation. It's inevitable.
[1:13:50.440 --> 1:13:52.440]  Colonel, you fight in war zones.
[1:13:52.440 --> 1:13:54.440]  People are getting way too crazy about politics.
[1:13:54.440 --> 1:13:56.440]  These are a difference in
[1:13:56.440 --> 1:13:58.440]  philosophy, shouldn't be shooting at each other
[1:13:58.440 --> 1:14:00.440]  and trying to stab each other
[1:14:00.440 --> 1:14:02.440]  rushing in stages. It's out of control.
[1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:04.440]  Hopefully people, rational people
[1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:06.440]  will dial it back.
[1:14:06.440 --> 1:14:08.440]  I didn't think I'd have to tap into your
[1:14:08.440 --> 1:14:10.440]  terrorism knowledge for these segments, but sadly we do.
[1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:12.440]  The president
[1:14:12.440 --> 1:14:14.440]  for better or for worse is the ultimate classification
[1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:16.440]  or declassification authority. He can talk
[1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:18.440]  to anybody about anything
[1:14:18.440 --> 1:14:20.440]  no matter what the level is.
[1:14:20.440 --> 1:14:22.440]  Beyond that, I understand
[1:14:22.440 --> 1:14:24.440]  that things were instantly twisted
[1:14:24.440 --> 1:14:26.440]  by the National Security Council staff
[1:14:26.440 --> 1:14:28.440]  and leaked obviously to the post.
[1:14:28.440 --> 1:14:30.440]  There was a very delayed
[1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:32.440]  very muted response where they should
[1:14:32.440 --> 1:14:34.440]  have been right up there outlining the facts
[1:14:34.440 --> 1:14:36.440]  right up front about how this is completely
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:38.440]  false. So I think
[1:14:38.440 --> 1:14:40.440]  like you point out, the White House
[1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:42.440]  communication staff has to believe
[1:14:42.440 --> 1:14:44.440]  they are now at a state of war. This is war.
[1:14:44.440 --> 1:14:46.440]  It's called information operations,
[1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:48.440]  information warfare, and clearly
[1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:50.440]  the other side, the deep state
[1:14:50.440 --> 1:14:52.440]  and the Clinton folks
[1:14:52.440 --> 1:14:54.440]  and I have to say some folks on the
[1:14:54.440 --> 1:14:56.440]  Republican side are all lining up
[1:14:56.440 --> 1:14:58.440]  the battle lines are drawn
[1:14:58.440 --> 1:15:00.440]  and it's time for people to understand how
[1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:02.440]  to deal with this like it's a war.
[1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:04.440]  The deep state
[1:15:04.440 --> 1:15:06.440]  is committed to maintaining
[1:15:06.440 --> 1:15:08.440]  this assault, it seems.
[1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:10.440]  I mean we're not even four months into
[1:15:10.440 --> 1:15:12.440]  the Trump presidency
[1:15:12.440 --> 1:15:14.440]  and the assaults continue,
[1:15:14.440 --> 1:15:16.440]  the attacks continue
[1:15:16.440 --> 1:15:18.440]  and we have as you indicated
[1:15:18.440 --> 1:15:20.440]  the outset. The New York
[1:15:20.440 --> 1:15:22.440]  Times and the Washington Post
[1:15:22.440 --> 1:15:24.440]  these are no longer fake news.
[1:15:24.440 --> 1:15:26.440]  I mean they are, it's
[1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:28.440]  an entire Psyops. It is
[1:15:28.440 --> 1:15:30.440]  a disinformation campaign
[1:15:30.440 --> 1:15:32.440]  from previous
[1:15:32.440 --> 1:15:34.440]  former journalists.
[1:15:34.440 --> 1:15:36.440]  What do you think
[1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:38.440]  having some experience with all of the above
[1:15:38.440 --> 1:15:40.440]  would be an appropriate response
[1:15:40.440 --> 1:15:42.440]  by this White House? Well, two things.
[1:15:42.440 --> 1:15:44.440]  First, you're completely correct
[1:15:44.440 --> 1:15:46.440]  on the papers. I mean this is, they've become
[1:15:46.440 --> 1:15:48.440]  probed for, just to use a Cold War
[1:15:48.440 --> 1:15:50.440]  metaphor. It's
[1:15:50.440 --> 1:15:52.440]  shameful. Secondly, regarding the very fact
[1:15:52.440 --> 1:15:54.440]  and look, I've met with senior intelligence
[1:15:54.440 --> 1:15:56.440]  officials now in place and
[1:15:56.440 --> 1:15:58.440]  Lou, they have to go through and sort
[1:15:58.440 --> 1:16:00.440]  out who is going to be
[1:16:00.440 --> 1:16:02.440]  actual career people who are going to do their job
[1:16:02.440 --> 1:16:04.440]  and those who are loyal to the previous administration
[1:16:04.440 --> 1:16:06.440]  and some of these folks have transitioned from
[1:16:06.440 --> 1:16:08.440]  what we call political appointee jobs
[1:16:08.440 --> 1:16:10.440]  into career jobs. So you got to go through
[1:16:10.440 --> 1:16:12.440]  so my recommendation
[1:16:12.440 --> 1:16:14.440]  I'll tell you what I said. You need to go
[1:16:14.440 --> 1:16:16.440]  fire two people, two levels down.
[1:16:16.440 --> 1:16:18.440]  Everybody below you two levels,
[1:16:18.440 --> 1:16:20.440]  fire them. Be done with it.
[1:16:20.440 --> 1:16:22.440]  Thank you for your service to America. It's time for you to find
[1:16:22.440 --> 1:16:24.440]  a new job and then start looking
[1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:26.440]  for people who are going to be loyal to the American
[1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:28.440]  people and to the policies of this
[1:16:28.440 --> 1:16:30.440]  president. That's where
[1:16:30.440 --> 1:16:32.440]  we are and the left isn't
[1:16:32.440 --> 1:16:34.440]  the left. It's a bunch of foreign bank funded crazies
[1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:36.440]  backing Bezos everybody
[1:16:36.440 --> 1:16:38.440]  that are destroying the economy, battling
[1:16:38.440 --> 1:16:40.440]  Trump trying to cut taxes for the
[1:16:40.440 --> 1:16:42.440]  average person. It makes me so mad to see ignorant
[1:16:42.440 --> 1:16:44.440]  mobs of people believing
[1:16:44.440 --> 1:16:46.440]  the propaganda running around stabbing, shooting
[1:16:46.440 --> 1:16:48.440]  and murdering and it's not conservatives
[1:16:48.440 --> 1:16:50.440]  doing it. It's 99% of the time
[1:16:50.440 --> 1:16:52.440]  liberals and then you heard Fox News
[1:16:52.440 --> 1:16:54.440]  earlier going it's wrong for both sides to do
[1:16:54.440 --> 1:16:56.440]  this shooting people and stabbing
[1:16:56.440 --> 1:16:58.440]  people and rushing on
[1:16:58.440 --> 1:17:00.440]  stages. So
[1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:02.440]  we rush on stages and say
[1:17:02.440 --> 1:17:04.440]  stop having murder the president rituals
[1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:06.440]  in public.
[1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:08.440]  Okay, this isn't first
[1:17:08.440 --> 1:17:10.440]  amendment. You're promoting with taxpayer money.
[1:17:10.440 --> 1:17:12.440]  That's the same as shooting a congressman
[1:17:12.440 --> 1:17:14.440]  in cops. Joe Biggs
[1:17:14.440 --> 1:17:16.440]  joins us to break this down. One of
[1:17:16.440 --> 1:17:18.440]  his friends got stabbed last
[1:17:18.440 --> 1:17:20.440]  night out in California. We can show folks the article
[1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:22.440]  on infowars.com. Here
[1:17:22.440 --> 1:17:24.440]  him with the gentleman that
[1:17:24.440 --> 1:17:26.440]  got stabbed.
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:28.440]  This is a real, real
[1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:30.440]  travesty. Antonio
[1:17:30.440 --> 1:17:32.440]  Foreman. Tell us about what happened, Joe.
[1:17:32.440 --> 1:17:34.440]  He was at a
[1:17:34.440 --> 1:17:36.440]  free speech rally yesterday with
[1:17:36.440 --> 1:17:38.440]  Kyle Chapman a.k.a. base
[1:17:38.440 --> 1:17:40.440]  stick band. He's also
[1:17:40.440 --> 1:17:42.440]  baked Alaska Tim Treadstone's
[1:17:42.440 --> 1:17:44.440]  bodyguard. He goes all these events across
[1:17:44.440 --> 1:17:46.440]  the country, the free speech
[1:17:46.440 --> 1:17:48.440]  events to different events where
[1:17:48.440 --> 1:17:50.440]  Antifa and the Left are trying to
[1:17:50.440 --> 1:17:52.440]  take down monuments of American history.
[1:17:52.440 --> 1:17:54.440]  So he's been to a lot of these events
[1:17:54.440 --> 1:17:56.440]  before. He's a well-profiled
[1:17:56.440 --> 1:17:58.440]  person. Looks like he was targeted is what you're saying.
[1:17:58.440 --> 1:18:00.440]  I believe so. I mean, I believe it was
[1:18:00.440 --> 1:18:02.440]  an Antifa attack or some cent.
[1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:04.440]  They probably said they were Armenians.
[1:18:04.440 --> 1:18:06.440]  They're probably Muslims, probably trying to
[1:18:06.440 --> 1:18:08.440]  escape good Armenians. Yeah, I just think
[1:18:08.440 --> 1:18:10.440]  it's interesting they said that the car ran
[1:18:10.440 --> 1:18:12.440]  through a barrier and then ran into his car.
[1:18:12.440 --> 1:18:14.440]  Then they got out all nonchalantly and said,
[1:18:14.440 --> 1:18:16.440]  hey, you know, yeah, let's exchange
[1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:18.440]  information. And then all of a sudden they flipped
[1:18:18.440 --> 1:18:20.440]  out. I mean, who runs into a car
[1:18:20.440 --> 1:18:22.440]  through a barrier on accident? And then
[1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:24.440]  all of a sudden it turns into a stabbing.
[1:18:24.440 --> 1:18:26.440]  I mean, the cops are saying it wasn't
[1:18:26.440 --> 1:18:28.440]  premeditated. Totally premeditated. They
[1:18:28.440 --> 1:18:30.440]  were gutting themselves up to do it.
[1:18:30.440 --> 1:18:32.440]  They were making sure there weren't any guns out.
[1:18:32.440 --> 1:18:34.440]  I mean, it's interesting what you're talking
[1:18:34.440 --> 1:18:36.440]  about earlier with that Muslim girl that
[1:18:36.440 --> 1:18:38.440]  was killed. There was a lady named Amy
[1:18:38.440 --> 1:18:40.440]  Siskind. She's a verified account
[1:18:40.440 --> 1:18:42.440]  on Twitter. I don't know what she does, but
[1:18:42.440 --> 1:18:44.440]  she goes, oh my God, this is what happens
[1:18:44.440 --> 1:18:46.440]  in Trump's America.
[1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:48.440]  I go, that's BS. I said, you have
[1:18:48.440 --> 1:18:50.440]  an agenda and you're ignoring the facts
[1:18:50.440 --> 1:18:52.440]  that she was killed by an illegal alien.
[1:18:52.440 --> 1:18:54.440]  If POTUS was allowed to do
[1:18:54.440 --> 1:18:56.440]  what he wanted to do with a travel band
[1:18:56.440 --> 1:18:58.440]  and build the wall, this wouldn't have
[1:18:58.440 --> 1:19:00.440]  happened. I said, you're using this to spin
[1:19:00.440 --> 1:19:02.440]  your own agenda, to blame
[1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:04.440]  it on the white man, to blame it on the
[1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:06.440]  conservative, when in fact it was
[1:19:06.440 --> 1:19:08.440]  a minority who killed another minority
[1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:10.440]  has nothing to do with Trump, has nothing
[1:19:10.440 --> 1:19:12.440]  to do with conservatism. It just has to do
[1:19:12.440 --> 1:19:14.440]  with a bad person that got through the
[1:19:14.440 --> 1:19:16.440]  border when he shouldn't have been here
[1:19:16.440 --> 1:19:18.440]  in the first place. And now you have
[1:19:18.440 --> 1:19:20.440]  the Daily Caller. They've come out with a
[1:19:20.440 --> 1:19:22.440]  list of attacks on conservatives.
[1:19:22.440 --> 1:19:24.440]  Just in January, a Trump supporter was
[1:19:24.440 --> 1:19:26.440]  knocked unconscious after airport
[1:19:26.440 --> 1:19:28.440]  protesters repeatedly beat him
[1:19:28.440 --> 1:19:30.440]  instead. A Trump supporter was attacked
[1:19:30.440 --> 1:19:32.440]  another time after putting out a fire
[1:19:32.440 --> 1:19:34.440]  that was started by an anti-Trump
[1:19:34.440 --> 1:19:36.440]  protester. I mean, he goes on and on
[1:19:36.440 --> 1:19:38.440]  and on. Well, you know what needs to
[1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:40.440]  happen. People need to start
[1:19:40.440 --> 1:19:42.440]  packing. And when somebody pulls a knife
[1:19:42.440 --> 1:19:44.440]  out or someone tries to kill them or attack
[1:19:44.440 --> 1:19:46.440]  them, people need to defend themselves and
[1:19:46.440 --> 1:19:48.440]  put these animals down. But let's say
[1:19:48.440 --> 1:19:50.440]  that's me calling for terror. No, somebody
[1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:52.440]  tries to kill you, defend yourself. That's
[1:19:52.440 --> 1:19:54.440]  America. We're not North Korea where you
[1:19:54.440 --> 1:19:56.440]  liberals go on vacation and just dream
[1:19:56.440 --> 1:19:58.440]  of destroying us to death and raping our families.
[1:19:58.440 --> 1:20:00.440]  We're going to fight you dirt bags.
[1:20:00.440 --> 1:20:02.440]  Hold the ride back.
[1:20:02.440 --> 1:20:04.440]  It's a no-brainer. A Big Berkey
[1:20:04.440 --> 1:20:06.440]  water filter is the one you need, period.
[1:20:06.440 --> 1:20:08.440]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine,
[1:20:08.440 --> 1:20:10.440]  fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other
[1:20:10.440 --> 1:20:12.440]  endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria,
[1:20:12.440 --> 1:20:14.440]  viruses, and much more, right?
[1:20:14.440 --> 1:20:16.440]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[1:20:18.440 --> 1:20:20.440]  gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.

[1:20:32.440 --> 1:20:34.440]  Many books have been written regarding the
[1:20:34.440 --> 1:20:36.440]  law of attraction. But what if all these
[1:20:36.440 --> 1:20:38.440]  books are missing the most important information
[1:20:38.440 --> 1:20:40.440]  we can use when it comes to activating this

[1:20:48.440 --> 1:20:50.440]  attraction really works and how it is
[1:20:50.440 --> 1:20:52.440]  being suppressed in our lives. Learn

[1:21:06.440 --> 1:21:08.440]  Great. Hey, thank you so much.

[1:23:00.960 --> 1:23:05.720]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former Congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[1:23:05.720 --> 1:23:10.080]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables
[1:23:10.080 --> 1:23:13.880]  that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[1:23:13.880 --> 1:23:16.880]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[1:23:16.880 --> 1:23:20.720]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:23.560]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[1:23:23.560 --> 1:23:27.720]  It's by using the amazing home freeze dryer from HarvestRite.
[1:23:27.720 --> 1:23:31.880]  I have a HarvestRite freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[1:23:31.880 --> 1:23:37.120]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[1:23:37.120 --> 1:23:41.640]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long-lasting
[1:23:41.640 --> 1:23:46.280]  food on hand, so no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[1:23:46.280 --> 1:23:48.000]  We love our freeze dryer.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:54.400]  To learn more, go to HarvestRite.com or call 800-923-9591.
[1:23:54.400 --> 1:24:18.240]  That's HarvestRite.com or 800-923-9591.
[1:24:18.240 --> 1:24:25.640]  I want to be clear, I am not for offensive attacks on the left, on communists, on jihadis,
[1:24:25.640 --> 1:24:26.640]  on anybody.
[1:24:26.640 --> 1:24:31.440]  But if somebody walks up and says, get ready to be stabbed white boy, get ready to be shanked
[1:24:31.440 --> 1:24:36.560]  and pulls a knife out, you better have a concealed carry, you better draw, and you better defend
[1:24:36.560 --> 1:24:37.560]  yourself.
[1:24:37.560 --> 1:24:40.680]  Now, that's what they teach you, concealed carry class, you name it, but go get your
[1:24:40.680 --> 1:24:43.040]  own training, go get farms training.
[1:24:43.040 --> 1:24:44.040]  Don't be looking for trouble.
[1:24:44.040 --> 1:24:45.040]  I'm not looking for trouble.
[1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:49.920]  I don't want the trouble of having to put somebody down, but you know, I've had leftists
[1:24:49.920 --> 1:24:54.200]  walk over to me in downtown Austin and say, you and Trump can go to hell and show me their
[1:24:54.200 --> 1:24:55.200]  gun.
[1:24:55.200 --> 1:24:56.560]  And I'm just like, are you kidding?
[1:24:56.560 --> 1:25:00.880]  And that time I was with four people who were all armed with concealed carries and we were
[1:25:00.880 --> 1:25:02.920]  all going to the shooting range.
[1:25:02.920 --> 1:25:07.000]  We walked out of a restaurant, he followed us out and we all turned like in a gunfighter
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:12.560]  movie and we're just standing there and I was with trained military people and the guy
[1:25:12.560 --> 1:25:17.360]  kind of got sense and walked off, but that's where this country's gone ladies and gentlemen,
[1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:19.680]  these people are whacked out.
[1:25:19.680 --> 1:25:25.400]  So the question is, do we run like they tell them to do in England, if a Muslim's running
[1:25:25.400 --> 1:25:29.480]  over with a car or shooting you or stabbing you, do you say, I'm sorry, I'm a European
[1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:33.640]  or I'm white or I'm Christian and just help them slit your throat?
[1:25:33.640 --> 1:25:38.000]  Or do you like line your kids up in the street for them to run them over or do you just bow
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:44.480]  down and worship or if a leftist wants to stab you, you say, I'm sorry, here's the heart.
[1:25:44.480 --> 1:25:47.680]  I mean, because that's how crazy all of this has gotten.
[1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:49.520]  So we're not even being sarcastic now.
[1:25:49.520 --> 1:25:55.240]  We've reached this point with a bunch of hyper-violence scum that wants civil war funded by a bizarro
[1:25:55.240 --> 1:26:01.680]  Nazi collaborator and we've got, here's the clip, Bernie Sanders, do whatever is necessary,
[1:26:01.680 --> 1:26:06.200]  go to the next level, do whatever you need to.
[1:26:06.200 --> 1:26:12.280]  Like people don't know what it's like to be, to be poor and even though my supporters
[1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:18.520]  just shot cops and other people and almost killed a Congressman, the, the way you want.
[1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:20.800]  And CNN's got guest on, but what's her?
[1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:21.800]  He wasn't evil.
[1:26:21.800 --> 1:26:22.800]  He was a good man.
[1:26:22.800 --> 1:26:23.800]  And what's her's like?
[1:26:23.800 --> 1:26:25.320]  Yes, yes, yes.
[1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:27.520]  Well, what happens at some point?
[1:26:27.520 --> 1:26:31.000]  Here is Bernie Sanders.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:35.840]  Our job from coast to coast is to bring millions of people together.
[1:26:35.840 --> 1:26:40.880]  When I talk about a political revolution, this is what I'm talking about, is for people
[1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:48.960]  all over this country to make a venture on every level of government to say that in America,
[1:26:48.960 --> 1:26:52.760]  you know, we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world.
[1:26:52.760 --> 1:26:58.200]  We are not going to do horrendous things to millions and millions of working people.
[1:26:58.200 --> 1:27:00.400]  We got to stand up and fight back.
[1:27:00.400 --> 1:27:05.440]  We have got to be involved in the political process in a way that we have never been before.
[1:27:05.440 --> 1:27:09.760]  Because what is happening now in Washington is unprecedented.
[1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:16.040]  This is the worst piece of legislation, the House bill that I can recall in 25, 26 years.
[1:27:16.040 --> 1:27:20.040]  Yeah, he likes stuff like they had in Venezuela, North Korea and Cuba, Joe Biggs, where is
[1:27:20.040 --> 1:27:21.040]  all this going?
[1:27:21.040 --> 1:27:22.240]  I mean, how bad can this get?
[1:27:22.240 --> 1:27:27.560]  Well, here's the thing Americans have to realize is that most Americans are complacent.
[1:27:27.560 --> 1:27:30.160]  Most of our citizens have never been in combat situations.
[1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:35.880]  Most of them have never had to live day to day with a fear of possibly being shot, attacked,
[1:27:35.880 --> 1:27:37.280]  blown up or anything like that.
[1:27:37.280 --> 1:27:41.800]  So Americans have a different mindset and they need to break that mindset and they need
[1:27:41.800 --> 1:27:43.440]  to think offensively.
[1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:47.720]  It doesn't mean act or react offensively all the time, but it means to have that thought
[1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:49.160]  in the back of your head.
[1:27:49.160 --> 1:27:53.000]  If something does go wrong today, am I ready to deal with this?
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:57.520]  And when you're in combat, you constantly have to think about what could possibly happen
[1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:01.680]  and you have to run through different types of scenarios in your head as to how I am going
[1:28:01.680 --> 1:28:05.720]  to react to defend myself and always look for different ways out.
[1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:09.200]  So for instance, in a parking garage, where are my exits?
[1:28:09.200 --> 1:28:10.600]  Where are my entrances?
[1:28:10.600 --> 1:28:11.600]  Was it well lit?
[1:28:11.600 --> 1:28:12.880]  Am I parked in a well lit area?
[1:28:12.880 --> 1:28:14.320]  Am I parked in a dark area?
[1:28:14.320 --> 1:28:16.320]  Am I being followed?
[1:28:16.320 --> 1:28:19.360]  Things like that you need to think about, do I have a knife on me?
[1:28:19.360 --> 1:28:20.360]  Where is it?
[1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:25.160]  If I'm left handed and I have a knife in my left pocket, I'm carrying groceries with
[1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:30.480]  my left hand, I've automatically taken seconds away from my action or my reaction time to
[1:28:30.480 --> 1:28:32.480]  be able to draw that to protect myself.
[1:28:32.480 --> 1:28:36.960]  So people need to break away from that complacency that they had that it's not going to happen
[1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:37.960]  to you.
[1:28:37.960 --> 1:28:41.920]  Just like Europe has to get used to the fact that almost every day there could be an attack
[1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:45.080]  where ISIS could blow them up, stab them, attack them.
[1:28:45.080 --> 1:28:49.720]  We have a similar threat here with Antifa and with the left because they somewhat are
[1:28:49.720 --> 1:28:51.920]  aligning with ISIS like tactics.
[1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:56.680]  And now they've programmed some minorities to just attack whites because they're white,
[1:28:56.680 --> 1:28:59.120]  not even wearing Trump shirts, not even doing anything.
[1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:02.560]  In fact, some people wearing red hats are now being attacked and being reported.
[1:29:02.560 --> 1:29:06.800]  We have to, again, understand, ladies and gentlemen, that if we give into this intimidation,
[1:29:06.800 --> 1:29:08.080]  the globalists are going to win.
[1:29:08.080 --> 1:29:13.040]  We've got to be more political now, be more out in the open now, and quite frankly, everybody
[1:29:13.040 --> 1:29:17.000]  needs to conceal Kerry to defend ourselves to begin to send a message that when they
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:20.520]  attack, just like somebody robbing a liquor store or breaking in your house, when they
[1:29:20.520 --> 1:29:24.920]  attack, unfortunately, they're going to have to pay for their ignorance.
[1:29:24.920 --> 1:29:29.000]  Well, what people have to think about, too, is it really worth me going out to that bar
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:33.880]  and having those drinks in an area that I know that I'm hugely outnumbered politically
[1:29:33.880 --> 1:29:34.880]  in my sense.
[1:29:34.880 --> 1:29:37.920]  You know, if you go out and drink beers or you could drink alcohol and you go back and
[1:29:37.920 --> 1:29:39.680]  pull a gun, you're screwed.
[1:29:39.680 --> 1:29:41.680]  So there's a lot of things you have to think about.
[1:29:41.680 --> 1:29:42.680]  Exactly.
[1:29:42.680 --> 1:29:46.240]  The globalists want the left to segregate from libertarians, the right Christians.
[1:29:46.240 --> 1:29:49.000]  Unfortunately, they live off our money anyways.
[1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:50.280]  It's time to ostracize them.
[1:29:50.280 --> 1:29:52.040]  It's time to shun them.
[1:29:52.040 --> 1:29:55.720]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[1:29:55.720 --> 1:30:03.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:03.120 --> 1:30:05.480]  One thing I love to talk about is liberal hypocrisy.
[1:30:05.480 --> 1:30:08.800]  Today, I want to talk about Ben and Jerry's, the ice cream makers out of Vermont.
[1:30:08.800 --> 1:30:11.720]  At the end of last year, they wrote an open letter to President Trump where they talked
[1:30:11.720 --> 1:30:16.280]  about how they are strong advocates for racial, social justice, women, people of color, Muslims,
[1:30:16.280 --> 1:30:20.320]  migrants, refugees, the poor, and those who are further compromised by the policies and
[1:30:20.320 --> 1:30:22.120]  rhetoric you espouse during your campaign.
[1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:26.360]  Well, over the weekend, scores of farm workers and activists marched on Ben and Jerry's.
[1:30:26.360 --> 1:30:27.360]  Why?
[1:30:27.360 --> 1:30:30.200]  Because the migrant farm workers don't like the way they are being treated by the farms
[1:30:30.200 --> 1:30:32.200]  that provide milk to Ben and Jerry's.
[1:30:32.200 --> 1:30:35.680]  And these migrant farm workers, many of whom are illegal, started the Milk with Dignity
[1:30:35.680 --> 1:30:39.200]  program in 2014 with the Vermont group Migrant Justice.
[1:30:39.200 --> 1:30:42.760]  To ensure farms provide migrant workers, some of which are illegal, fair wages, working
[1:30:42.760 --> 1:30:44.360]  conditions and decent housing.
[1:30:44.360 --> 1:30:48.960]  In 2015, Ben and Jerry's agreed to join the program, but they're still stuck in negotiations.
[1:30:48.960 --> 1:30:50.920]  So will they join the Milk with Dignity program?
[1:30:50.920 --> 1:30:51.920]  Who knows?
[1:30:51.920 --> 1:30:54.600]  But right now, migrants are protesting at the Ben and Jerry's headquarters to ensure
[1:30:54.600 --> 1:30:56.000]  they get their freebies.
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:59.640]  We don't know the outcome, but one thing I sure do love is this liberal hypocrisy.
[1:30:59.640 --> 1:31:02.760]  Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[1:31:02.760 --> 1:31:03.760]  Imbrick's Essentials.
[1:31:03.760 --> 1:31:04.760]  That's my middle name.
[1:31:04.760 --> 1:31:10.920]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already
[1:31:10.920 --> 1:31:16.240]  trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic
[1:31:16.240 --> 1:31:17.240]  and high quality.
[1:31:17.240 --> 1:31:23.480]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high quality
[1:31:23.480 --> 1:31:26.440]  organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[1:31:26.440 --> 1:31:30.920]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[1:31:30.920 --> 1:31:31.920]  It is an answer to prayer.
[1:31:31.920 --> 1:31:35.920]  And because we're cutting up the middleman, 20% off retail, sign up for auto-ship, an
[1:31:35.920 --> 1:31:38.120]  additional 25% off.
[1:31:38.120 --> 1:31:39.200]  It's all there.
[1:31:39.200 --> 1:31:44.640]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[1:31:44.640 --> 1:31:49.200]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Imbrick's Essentials, and it's
[1:31:49.200 --> 1:31:55.480]  on average 20% off what it would be in stores buying it directly from InfowarsStore.com.
[1:31:55.480 --> 1:31:59.880]  Help us win the Infowar while getting products everybody needs, InfowarsLife.com where you'll
[1:31:59.880 --> 1:32:02.280]  find the entire line of Imbrick's Essentials.
[1:32:02.280 --> 1:32:06.160]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[1:32:06.160 --> 1:32:08.000]  in stock at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:11.800]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week, I thought it would be a six-month
[1:32:11.800 --> 1:32:12.800]  supply for listeners.
[1:32:12.800 --> 1:32:17.040]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their
[1:32:17.040 --> 1:32:18.040]  Super Blue.
[1:32:18.040 --> 1:32:21.280]  Research across the board is clear, in fact, it's certified.
[1:32:21.280 --> 1:32:25.160]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood
[1:32:25.160 --> 1:32:26.160]  clots and heart attacks.
[1:32:26.160 --> 1:32:30.880]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[1:32:30.880 --> 1:32:33.440]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[1:32:33.440 --> 1:32:37.560]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen
[1:32:37.560 --> 1:32:39.880]  iodine, so the bad halogen fluoride.
[1:32:39.880 --> 1:32:44.440]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out
[1:32:44.440 --> 1:32:46.920]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:32:46.920 --> 1:32:51.320]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[1:32:51.320 --> 1:32:54.440]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[1:32:54.440 --> 1:32:59.520]  Learn more about InfowarsLife Super Blue toothpaste at InfowarsLife.com and support
[1:32:59.520 --> 1:33:14.840]  the Infowar while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[1:33:14.840 --> 1:33:19.000]  Laura Lermer is an amazing libertarian, patriot activist, I've been familiar with her work
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:20.000]  for a while.
[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:21.480]  And we finally got her on the show.
[1:33:21.480 --> 1:33:24.880]  She was on Hannity last night, and of course, speaking of Hannity last night, we're also
[1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:28.760]  going to debate the fact that Hannity said, listen, release the Alex Jones tapes.
[1:33:28.760 --> 1:33:35.440]  That's what NBC should be doing in March, Ted Coppel interviewed him for 50 minutes
[1:33:35.440 --> 1:33:40.520]  and aired 70 seconds of what he had to say, edited so bad, it was unintelligible.
[1:33:40.520 --> 1:33:44.520]  Now, at least he didn't put a light underneath his chin like they did me.
[1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:46.920]  I mean, this is incredible.
[1:33:46.920 --> 1:33:50.600]  And then they said Joe Biggs was a liar and that we didn't catch drugs coming across the
[1:33:50.600 --> 1:33:55.360]  border, even though local news said it was clearly drugs and the FBI asked to meet with
[1:33:55.360 --> 1:34:01.240]  Joe, I can talk about this now and commended him and he got intel from the FBI about an
[1:34:01.240 --> 1:34:04.320]  ISIS base that they weren't even allowed to go to.
[1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:07.360]  And Joe went there and the FBI met him again.
[1:34:07.360 --> 1:34:11.440]  And then a year later, judicial watch caught the documents and confirmed it was all true.
[1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:12.440]  Of course it was true.
[1:34:12.440 --> 1:34:17.040]  The FBI contacted us because Joe, they thought was crazy enough.
[1:34:17.040 --> 1:34:19.920]  They said brave enough to go in there as a journalist.
[1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:21.000]  They wanted video of it.
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:24.640]  So they were followed the whole, we're going to talk about that in a moment.
[1:34:24.640 --> 1:34:28.560]  But that just shows how this lady that reads off a teleprompter is pointing her finger
[1:34:28.560 --> 1:34:35.280]  at Joe Biggs, a veteran of all combat wars, Patriot, great job at info wars, contributes
[1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:36.280]  to info wars.
[1:34:36.280 --> 1:34:39.040]  And then he's a liar, everything on her piece is a lie.
[1:34:39.040 --> 1:34:43.680]  So I'm sick of her piece, worst ratings in the history of Dateline NBC.
[1:34:43.680 --> 1:34:44.880]  But that's the story.
[1:34:44.880 --> 1:34:47.640]  People have rejected it.
[1:34:47.640 --> 1:34:53.040]  Laura Lomert joins us and of course you can find out more about her on several websites.
[1:34:53.040 --> 1:34:56.320]  I'm going to ask her the best place for people to go because she's involved with a lot of
[1:34:56.320 --> 1:34:59.120]  different sites, the rebel.media.
[1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:02.400]  And of course she's worked a lot of other great organizations as well.
[1:35:02.400 --> 1:35:07.600]  She ran up on the stage at Shakespeare in the park where they're openly got the Trump
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:12.320]  character with the American flags, with the Eastern European Melania wife.
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:14.280]  They're admitting it's a simulated murder of Trump.
[1:35:14.280 --> 1:35:15.680]  They're promoting his murder everywhere.
[1:35:15.680 --> 1:35:18.280]  Then the media tried to say, oh, it's not really Trump.
[1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:19.280]  She's just crazy.
[1:35:19.280 --> 1:35:25.040]  It's a 500-year-old play from the most famous playwright ever, William Shakespeare.
[1:35:25.040 --> 1:35:28.120]  This is the deception in the games they play.
[1:35:28.120 --> 1:35:32.120]  You can follow her at freelora.com.
[1:35:32.120 --> 1:35:38.040]  And again, she joins us right now with Joe Biggs to break this down.
[1:35:38.040 --> 1:35:42.640]  And then of course we have the host of Fox and Friends saying that you were wrong.
[1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:47.600]  And I want to start with Fox News, that you were wrong, kill me.
[1:35:47.600 --> 1:35:50.720]  Others are saying that you were wrong to rush the stage.
[1:35:50.720 --> 1:35:54.000]  He says we don't want shootings and stabbings and rushing the stage.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:56.800]  Shootings and stabbings isn't rushing the stage.
[1:35:56.800 --> 1:36:01.920]  We're being peaceful saying don't promote violence, standing up with free speech.
[1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:04.640]  They're the ones that take over at events and don't let people speak.
[1:36:04.640 --> 1:36:08.160]  You just took over for two minutes and pointed out that they were simulating the murder of
[1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:09.160]  the president.
[1:36:09.160 --> 1:36:13.240]  There's this big national debate with conservatives over whether this is right or not and whether
[1:36:13.240 --> 1:36:15.360]  we should adopt the tactics of the left.
[1:36:15.360 --> 1:36:16.680]  Those aren't tactics of the left.
[1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:20.040]  Those are tactics of survival and taking action.
[1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:24.560]  And the globalists should know the libertarian right-wing patriot movement is about to get
[1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:28.000]  a lot more aggressive because we're trying to head off a civil war.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:29.480]  Laura Larimer, what do you say?
[1:36:29.480 --> 1:36:32.840]  Well, those are constitutional rights as well, Alex, right?
[1:36:32.840 --> 1:36:35.200]  So we have a right to free speech, a right to protest.
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:39.880]  And as long as it's peaceful and not violent like the left, you know, I can, I have a right
[1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:45.240]  to get up on that stage and protest against the assassination of our president and incitements
[1:36:45.240 --> 1:36:46.760]  of violence against the right.
[1:36:46.760 --> 1:36:47.760]  That's right.
[1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:51.560]  I mean, they're openly simulating murder, saying kill everybody.
[1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:52.560]  It's happening.
[1:36:52.560 --> 1:36:53.800]  They're calling for civil war.
[1:36:53.800 --> 1:36:56.840]  Top Democrats are calling for civil war.
[1:36:56.840 --> 1:37:01.840]  In fact, are we doing enough to aggressively, with information, get in these bully's faces?
[1:37:01.840 --> 1:37:03.960]  No, we're definitely not.
[1:37:03.960 --> 1:37:07.600]  And you know, I face a lot of criticism from people in the conservative movement for using
[1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:09.920]  what they're calling a leftist tactic.
[1:37:09.920 --> 1:37:14.600]  But if you look at Saul Linsky, for example, you know, promoter of leftist tactics, that's
[1:37:14.600 --> 1:37:15.600]  what we need to do.
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:21.800]  We need to adopt Linsky tactics and like he said, a Linsky rule number four, use the opposition's
[1:37:21.800 --> 1:37:22.800]  playbook against them.
[1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:27.720]  If we're going to win this war, which is a culture war, we need to start, you know, giving
[1:37:27.720 --> 1:37:32.320]  them a taste of their own medicine and showing the hypocrisy of their tactics by using their
[1:37:32.320 --> 1:37:33.920]  tactics against them.
[1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:34.920]  Because what was I doing?
[1:37:34.920 --> 1:37:37.440]  I got up on that stage and I protested their event.
[1:37:37.440 --> 1:37:43.080]  How many times have we seen lefty protesters interrupt and shut down conservative events?
[1:37:43.080 --> 1:37:45.760]  But then when I do it, it's not okay.
[1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:49.440]  Well, I'll have the Trump event in Chicago.
[1:37:49.440 --> 1:37:51.040]  They shut down the entire thing.
[1:37:51.040 --> 1:37:54.720]  And the fact that they're even going to compare these three things, shooting stabbings and
[1:37:54.720 --> 1:37:58.920]  rushing a stage and the same thing, that's just beyond me right there.
[1:37:58.920 --> 1:38:03.760]  I mean, there's nothing about rushing a stage that has anything to do with actual violence.
[1:38:03.760 --> 1:38:10.880]  She was protesting the actual, like she said last night, this violent porn, this assassination
[1:38:10.880 --> 1:38:15.960]  porn that we're seeing, the fact that people are promoting it as okay.
[1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:20.560]  Then we see Kathy Griffin hold a bloodied, beheaded version of Donald Trump and his son
[1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:21.560]  sees that.
[1:38:21.560 --> 1:38:23.640]  It's completely traumatized by that.
[1:38:23.640 --> 1:38:25.280]  It's making it okay for that.
[1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:30.760]  It is empowering people like this guy who went to the baseball game and purposely picked
[1:38:30.760 --> 1:38:32.720]  out Republicans to shoot.
[1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:34.720]  This guy had to kill this.
[1:38:34.720 --> 1:38:39.320]  There's so much fear mongering coming from the left that people are buying into it so
[1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:42.920]  much that they are willing to go out, stab and shoot at people.
[1:38:42.920 --> 1:38:43.920]  Right.
[1:38:43.920 --> 1:38:48.160]  And one thing that I mentioned too was that people were being encouraged by Kathy Griffin
[1:38:48.160 --> 1:38:53.920]  and also this play, Julius Caesar, in which the president gets stabbed on stage.
[1:38:53.920 --> 1:38:59.760]  And just one day after I've warned against liberals stabbing conservatives and stabbing
[1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:07.200]  our president, a conservative, pro-Trump supporter, Tony Foreman, was stabbed.
[1:39:07.200 --> 1:39:09.440]  Now he's in the hospital because liberals stabbed him.
[1:39:09.440 --> 1:39:13.560]  And Antifa recently just published a new poster that said, we beat them before, we'll
[1:39:13.560 --> 1:39:14.640]  beat them again.
[1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:21.880]  And it shows a knife being jabbed inside somebody wearing a Pepe logo and a swastika
[1:39:21.880 --> 1:39:22.880]  on their hat.
[1:39:22.880 --> 1:39:24.000]  So they're calling us Nazis.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:29.280]  They're using imagery from Julius Caesar, the knives, leftist armed with knives.
[1:39:29.280 --> 1:39:34.960]  If you saw the picture of me on stage, I interrupted it during the assassination scene because I
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:36.160]  wanted to stop the scene.
[1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:39.160]  And let's be clear, the minorities are not the people pushing this.
[1:39:39.160 --> 1:39:41.120]  And I'm not just saying that to virtue signal.
[1:39:41.120 --> 1:39:42.120]  It's true.
[1:39:42.120 --> 1:39:48.200]  It's mainly white liberals, big money, George Soros's, the Clinton Foundation, openly funding
[1:39:48.200 --> 1:39:53.920]  all these TV shows and movies where Trump's racist and I'm racist, and then Tom Brokaw
[1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:57.880]  says I'm racist, and then Hillary Clinton says I'm racist with no proof.
[1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:00.000]  They don't ever show it.
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:06.080]  And then they have Tom Brokaw back on the news Sunday night saying it, it's crazy.
[1:40:06.080 --> 1:40:11.160]  Now all over Austin, they've got images of women with machine guns shooting conservatives
[1:40:11.160 --> 1:40:17.440]  that the Communist Red Brigade have put out, stand up, shoot back and all this other stuff
[1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:22.240]  as if we're out there shooting and killing them and as if we are the Nazis.
[1:40:22.240 --> 1:40:24.240]  This is just totally insane.
[1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:28.920]  But they're whipping themselves up into this frenzy, wanting violence.
[1:40:28.920 --> 1:40:32.240]  Laura Loomer, where do you see this going?
[1:40:32.240 --> 1:40:37.680]  I think it's only going to get worse unless our politicians and members of the liberal
[1:40:37.680 --> 1:40:40.520]  mainstream media start to condemn political violence.
[1:40:40.520 --> 1:40:46.800]  So Julius Caesar was funded by the New York Times and CNN, and you have like how many
[1:40:46.800 --> 1:40:50.520]  members of the public watch CNN and read the New York Times, right?
[1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:55.800]  If so many people in our country are influenced by this liberal etiology and these liberal
[1:40:55.800 --> 1:40:59.920]  media outlets are paying to incite violence, it's not going to change unless they publicly
[1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:08.320]  condemn the alignment with ISIS, the alignment with Islam, this continuation of political
[1:41:08.320 --> 1:41:09.320]  violence.
[1:41:09.320 --> 1:41:14.360]  And so it's really up to us conservatives to lead the fight.
[1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:15.600]  I see it getting worse though.
[1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:19.400]  Well, it's interesting because people are saying that these plays, these images that
[1:41:19.400 --> 1:41:23.280]  Kathy Griffin put out, aren't really empowering people to go out and do stuff.
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:25.440]  And that's complete and total BS.
[1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:31.040]  When Tony was stabbed yesterday, nine times, Baked Alaska tweeted out at first and then
[1:41:31.040 --> 1:41:34.560]  he called me up and we talked about what was going on.
[1:41:34.560 --> 1:41:37.680]  I was looking at the responses, people were like, oh, they should have stabbed him more
[1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:39.800]  so he would have died.
[1:41:39.800 --> 1:41:42.000]  This cracker deserves to be killed.
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:46.400]  And these are the responses you're seeing from the left day in and day out without zero
[1:41:46.400 --> 1:41:48.600]  more for human life or anything at all.
[1:41:48.600 --> 1:41:49.600]  They don't care.
[1:41:49.600 --> 1:41:51.360]  They want us to die.
[1:41:51.360 --> 1:41:56.120]  There is a war going on and people have to understand to get out of that complacency
[1:41:56.120 --> 1:42:01.040]  mindset, to change how you think and understand that our world is changing around us.
[1:42:01.040 --> 1:42:02.040]  We have to be ready.
[1:42:02.040 --> 1:42:06.200]  It doesn't mean to act first, but if the time does come to react, to be ready and to do
[1:42:06.200 --> 1:42:07.200]  it right.
[1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:08.200]  Well, that's right.
[1:42:08.200 --> 1:42:09.200]  I mean, take Brian Killmeade.
[1:42:09.200 --> 1:42:13.720]  I'm not trying to bash him, but he's there last night and he's interviewing Colonel
[1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:19.240]  Schaefer and I guess this morning and he then again says, well, they're shooting, they're
[1:42:19.240 --> 1:42:21.760]  stabbing, they're rushing on stages.
[1:42:21.760 --> 1:42:22.760]  Everyone needs to stop.
[1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:27.920]  No, the left is shooting and stabbing and running people over with cars, but at a certain
[1:42:27.920 --> 1:42:33.000]  point conservatives are going to start responding back, which I don't want a bunch of dead mindless
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:35.320]  liberals that we were unable to deprogram.
[1:42:35.320 --> 1:42:36.880]  I want to break their conditioning.
[1:42:36.880 --> 1:42:37.880]  They're not real liberals.
[1:42:37.880 --> 1:42:39.400]  I don't see myself as a conservative.
[1:42:39.400 --> 1:42:44.160]  I see myself as a classical liberal Thomas Jefferson style, more taxes, more freedom,
[1:42:44.160 --> 1:42:48.480]  more mobility, you know, more of everything, more choice.
[1:42:48.480 --> 1:42:50.160]  That means real diversity.
[1:42:50.160 --> 1:42:53.960]  That means real tolerance, not all the left's authoritarianism.
[1:42:53.960 --> 1:42:57.520]  So the left is truly an authoritarian group of scum.
[1:42:57.520 --> 1:42:58.520]  That's their goal though.
[1:42:58.520 --> 1:43:02.240]  Their goal is to push a conservative to a breaking point where he reacts instead of
[1:43:02.240 --> 1:43:06.400]  thinks first, instead of thinking first and does something that so they can go see.
[1:43:06.400 --> 1:43:09.040]  I mean, look at the attacks that have happened in Europe over the last few days.
[1:43:09.040 --> 1:43:13.360]  You got one guy who drives a van into a crowd of people, kills one person, I believe it
[1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:14.600]  was at the end of the day.
[1:43:14.600 --> 1:43:20.240]  And it's like, oh my God, terrorism in London, terrorism, terrorism, and it's like everyone's
[1:43:20.240 --> 1:43:21.240]  up and up.
[1:43:21.240 --> 1:43:22.240]  They say, this is the right wingers.
[1:43:22.240 --> 1:43:23.240]  It's your fault.
[1:43:23.240 --> 1:43:24.240]  You all need to be banned.
[1:43:24.240 --> 1:43:25.240]  It's all the Christian's fault.
[1:43:25.240 --> 1:43:29.200]  And then meanwhile, but whenever a Muslim blows up 22 girls and kills them, oh, it's
[1:43:29.200 --> 1:43:30.320]  not a Muslim.
[1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:32.840]  We all need to be peaceful and just give in and go along with it.
[1:43:32.840 --> 1:43:34.560]  Let me ask Laura Loomer this question.
[1:43:34.560 --> 1:43:39.520]  Why, because you're a woman and you're there in New York City, why do you think the left
[1:43:39.520 --> 1:43:43.040]  and feminists particularly are so in love with radical Islam?
[1:43:43.040 --> 1:43:45.040]  Is this a form of cuckolding?
[1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:47.560]  Is this a form of masochism?
[1:43:47.560 --> 1:43:50.440]  Is this a form of Stockholm syndrome?
[1:43:50.440 --> 1:43:51.440]  I don't know.
[1:43:51.440 --> 1:43:55.720]  I mean, I'm definitely not a feminist and I've been very outspoken against the alignments
[1:43:55.720 --> 1:43:58.400]  of the feminist movement with Islam.
[1:43:58.400 --> 1:44:02.400]  I think that anyone who calls themselves a feminist really has a suicide wish.
[1:44:02.400 --> 1:44:04.680]  I think they have a suicide gene.
[1:44:04.680 --> 1:44:12.000]  I think that the left, you know, they suffer from Trump derangement syndrome.
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:16.600]  It's a case of mental illness, this extreme sense of liberalism.
[1:44:16.600 --> 1:44:18.920]  It really is borderline mental illness.
[1:44:18.920 --> 1:44:19.920]  It's a jihad.
[1:44:19.920 --> 1:44:21.480]  I mean, it's a death wish.
[1:44:21.480 --> 1:44:22.480]  It's a war wish.
[1:44:22.480 --> 1:44:25.160]  They want a, they want a right of passage.
[1:44:25.160 --> 1:44:29.760]  I mean, they dream about a red terror overthrow and how they're going to murder everybody.
[1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:34.160]  There's suddenly red brigade just marching all over Austin, attacking people, attacking
[1:44:34.160 --> 1:44:39.000]  pet sanctuaries, cat sanctuaries, saying, get out of here, gentrified scum.
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:42.880]  Get out of here, white people, and it's almost all white college students running around.
[1:44:42.880 --> 1:44:47.320]  And just like you said, Stockholm syndrome, it's a mental illness.
[1:44:47.320 --> 1:44:55.000]  These people have been brainwashed by the media and yeah, I can't explain it any other
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:56.640]  way than just a mental illness really.
[1:44:56.640 --> 1:45:00.200]  I've been saying this for a long time, that liberals have a suicide gene and there's a
[1:45:00.200 --> 1:45:04.680]  reason behind it because they're so obsessed with this social justice warrior mentality
[1:45:04.680 --> 1:45:08.880]  that they want to go help minorities and they feel empowered by it.
[1:45:08.880 --> 1:45:10.120]  They feel so good by it.
[1:45:10.120 --> 1:45:14.400]  Well, the thing is, is radical Islamists aren't stupid.
[1:45:14.400 --> 1:45:18.560]  And they see that their only way into this country is to use these people as pawns.
[1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:22.280]  So they play victims and they go, yeah, fight for us, fight for us.
[1:45:22.280 --> 1:45:26.880]  But what the left fails to realize nine times out of 10, they'll be the first ones to fall
[1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:31.760]  victim to those guys once they actually get into the country, establish their footprint
[1:45:31.760 --> 1:45:34.920]  and are able to start voting and making real changes.
[1:45:34.920 --> 1:45:40.560]  If you look at the amount of whites in the world, they're not having babies, but if you
[1:45:40.560 --> 1:45:43.800]  look at the amount of Muslims in the world, they're having way more babies right now
[1:45:43.800 --> 1:45:44.800]  than anybody else.
[1:45:44.800 --> 1:45:47.920]  There's a good chance that we're going to be the minority at some point in time.
[1:45:47.920 --> 1:45:52.080]  They want to come into the country, they want to overpopulate and they want to have their
[1:45:52.080 --> 1:45:54.160]  ability to outvote us.
[1:45:54.160 --> 1:45:56.680]  And the next thing you know, you got Sharia law and the liberals are going to be the
[1:45:56.680 --> 1:45:58.160]  first ones that go down.
[1:45:58.160 --> 1:46:03.160]  I want to ask both of you where you think this is going.
[1:46:03.160 --> 1:46:07.040]  At the end of the day, I don't think it's the Islamists that I'm even worried about
[1:46:07.040 --> 1:46:09.120]  the final summation.
[1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:13.120]  It's that the globalists are bringing them in, have this master plan or so anti-Christian
[1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:17.720]  or so anti-West and just foaming at the mouth and the universities are literally falling
[1:46:17.720 --> 1:46:18.720]  apart.
[1:46:18.720 --> 1:46:20.640]  They're giving people nearly worthless degrees.
[1:46:20.640 --> 1:46:24.800]  I see civilization going into the mud all because a bunch of billionaires wanted to make
[1:46:24.800 --> 1:46:26.300]  the public more manageable.
[1:46:26.300 --> 1:46:28.440]  So they dumbed us down and divided in Congress.
[1:46:28.440 --> 1:46:34.160]  But since I mentioned Kilmeade, here he is trying to equate conservatives incredible restraint,
[1:46:34.160 --> 1:46:40.280]  Americans incredible restraint, St. like Stoic restraint with us being involved in the reign
[1:46:40.280 --> 1:46:43.640]  of liberal violence and terror sweeping the globe.
[1:46:43.640 --> 1:46:44.640]  Here it is.
[1:46:44.640 --> 1:46:49.320]  This is the issue with the governments who were responsible for our common welfare, common
[1:46:49.320 --> 1:46:55.080]  good and defense are shown to be an effective people on the opposite side are going to rise
[1:46:55.080 --> 1:46:56.080]  up.
[1:46:56.080 --> 1:47:02.480]  So what you see here is the automatic response force on force of certain folks coming back
[1:47:02.480 --> 1:47:05.640]  to essentially create to retaliate.
[1:47:05.640 --> 1:47:08.160]  So again, the pathology is clear.
[1:47:08.160 --> 1:47:12.640]  If one side begins to act violently, you have inevitably the other side starting to come
[1:47:12.640 --> 1:47:13.640]  back.
[1:47:13.640 --> 1:47:14.560]  It always happens.
[1:47:14.560 --> 1:47:18.880]  So we have to understand if the government does not stop the violence on the left, you'll
[1:47:18.880 --> 1:47:20.960]  see more violence on the right and retaliation.
[1:47:20.960 --> 1:47:21.960]  It's inevitable.
[1:47:21.960 --> 1:47:27.240]  You, you, you fight in war zones, people are getting way too crazy about politics.
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:28.800]  These are a difference in philosophy.
[1:47:28.800 --> 1:47:29.800]  Right.
[1:47:29.800 --> 1:47:33.920]  You shouldn't be shooting at each other and trying to stab each other for resting in stages.
[1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:34.920]  It's out of control.
[1:47:34.920 --> 1:47:38.480]  Hopefully people, rational people will dial it back.
[1:47:38.480 --> 1:47:41.600]  I didn't think I'd have to tap into your terrorism knowledge for these segments.
[1:47:41.600 --> 1:47:44.960]  But sadly, we do.
[1:47:44.960 --> 1:47:45.960]  So.
[1:47:45.960 --> 1:47:48.360]  Colonel Shafer's warning, we're going into a civil war.
[1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:49.800]  The deep state wants to overthrow Trump.
[1:47:49.800 --> 1:47:51.480]  This isn't a game.
[1:47:51.480 --> 1:47:55.120]  I look at the fools that hate the economy being turned back on, they're racing to kill
[1:47:55.120 --> 1:47:56.120]  the economy.
[1:47:56.120 --> 1:47:58.800]  A lot of smart economists think that Trump tried to save it.
[1:47:58.800 --> 1:48:00.440]  They thought he could have saved it.
[1:48:00.440 --> 1:48:04.160]  Right now they're saying signs are they are blocking him, cutting taxes.
[1:48:04.160 --> 1:48:08.120]  If that doesn't happen, they think everything else is going to fail too little too late.
[1:48:08.120 --> 1:48:16.920]  Ron Paul, many others say that what's going to happen if, if the recovery fails, we plunge
[1:48:16.920 --> 1:48:22.560]  into a serious depression and the left's trying to impeach or kill the president.
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:25.040]  I don't see how a civil war doesn't break out.
[1:48:25.040 --> 1:48:28.760]  And then it just comes down to our states and our police and our citizens to come together
[1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:31.360]  and not give into this intimidation and this terror.
[1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:32.360]  What do you see happening?
[1:48:32.360 --> 1:48:35.840]  Well, I mean, I know a lot of police.
[1:48:35.840 --> 1:48:39.560]  I'm really good friends with, especially after the RNC trip, the whole Cleveland police
[1:48:39.560 --> 1:48:40.560]  department.
[1:48:40.560 --> 1:48:42.360]  I mean, these guys are sending me baby gifts and stuff.
[1:48:42.360 --> 1:48:46.160]  I mean, the police that I talked to around the country, even in Austin and stuff like
[1:48:46.160 --> 1:48:47.160]  that.
[1:48:47.160 --> 1:48:50.920]  Most of them are aligned with us and how we think the conservative ideas, more states
[1:48:50.920 --> 1:48:54.600]  rights, more power to the people, not being revenue generators.
[1:48:54.600 --> 1:48:59.360]  You know, I go to gun shows all over the country and I talk to retired sheriffs that hate their
[1:48:59.360 --> 1:49:01.960]  jobs just giving out tickets to do that.
[1:49:01.960 --> 1:49:06.160]  So you actually have real police, you have real people out there within the, within the
[1:49:06.160 --> 1:49:09.640]  government that want to do the right thing.
[1:49:09.640 --> 1:49:13.840]  So if it does go into a civil war and we spiral out of control, I think we're going to have
[1:49:13.840 --> 1:49:17.200]  a lot of good people on our side, a lot more than what a lot of people are thinking right
[1:49:17.200 --> 1:49:18.200]  now.
[1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:21.320]  And we have a lot of good people out there that know how to use their guns, that know
[1:49:21.320 --> 1:49:25.520]  how to actually go out and get food, who actually know how to live off the land and who just
[1:49:25.520 --> 1:49:29.480]  don't sit around in their mom's basement, eating Cheetos all day, playing video games.
[1:49:29.480 --> 1:49:33.440]  You know, the worst thing that could happen for the left is for something like that to
[1:49:33.440 --> 1:49:34.440]  happen.
[1:49:34.440 --> 1:49:36.360]  Because the people on the right are the ones that are outdoorsmen.
[1:49:36.360 --> 1:49:39.280]  We're the ones that go fishing and hunting and live off the land.
[1:49:39.280 --> 1:49:42.440]  For them, it would be the worst thing in the world, but for some reason they want it and
[1:49:42.440 --> 1:49:45.520]  it goes back to the whole thing that the left has a suicide gene.
[1:49:45.520 --> 1:49:47.040]  It just makes no sense.
[1:49:47.040 --> 1:49:53.320]  Yeah, I agree with Joe and you, one thing that you just said Alex, you said, if the left
[1:49:53.320 --> 1:49:56.680]  is trying to kill our president and assassinate him, they already are, it's not a question
[1:49:56.680 --> 1:50:02.920]  of if they already are actively plotting to assassinate and, you know, so there have been
[1:50:02.920 --> 1:50:08.720]  over 12,000, you know, threats to assassinate President Trump on Twitter since he's been
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:09.720]  elected president.
[1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:13.280]  I don't think I've ever seen that many active threats against a president's life ever.
[1:50:13.280 --> 1:50:15.480]  Well, what about newspaper editors?
[1:50:15.480 --> 1:50:19.400]  Every major newspaper I've seen has had writers saying kill him, you know, I'll buy the bullets.
[1:50:19.400 --> 1:50:22.000]  I mean, how are they going to feel?
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:26.040]  You have James, James divine, I think his name is, he said hashtag Hunter Republican
[1:50:26.040 --> 1:50:27.040]  congressman.
[1:50:27.040 --> 1:50:28.040]  He tweeted this.
[1:50:28.040 --> 1:50:31.200]  He's a democratic strategist, a paid democratic.
[1:50:31.200 --> 1:50:34.400]  He went on Tucker Carlson last night and defended it.
[1:50:34.400 --> 1:50:35.400]  Yeah.
[1:50:35.400 --> 1:50:36.400]  So he's hunting.
[1:50:36.400 --> 1:50:40.440]  I mean, Joe just talked about hunting, like Republicans being outdoors men and now the
[1:50:40.440 --> 1:50:45.800]  left is using or they want to come back and talk about that because, you know, you saw
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:50.440]  the day the congressman got shot last week, well, Blitzer had a guest on saying this guy's
[1:50:50.440 --> 1:50:51.440]  not evil.
[1:50:51.440 --> 1:50:52.440]  He's just tired of stuff.
[1:50:52.440 --> 1:50:54.960]  You know, he took political action and blitzer was like nodding his head.
[1:50:54.960 --> 1:50:59.240]  What happens then if people that we're trying to stop start going out and just saying, Hey,
[1:50:59.240 --> 1:51:00.240]  it's not, it's just political.
[1:51:00.240 --> 1:51:02.800]  I'm going to blow your head off.
[1:51:02.800 --> 1:51:07.340]  That's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[1:51:07.340 --> 1:51:08.920]  Those times may be near.
[1:51:08.920 --> 1:51:09.920]  Think about it.
[1:51:09.920 --> 1:51:14.600]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[1:51:14.600 --> 1:51:19.200]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns
[1:51:19.200 --> 1:51:23.440]  and a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a
[1:51:23.440 --> 1:51:25.200]  single cyber attack.
[1:51:25.200 --> 1:51:29.400]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide
[1:51:29.400 --> 1:51:31.960]  during a widespread national emergency.
[1:51:31.960 --> 1:51:34.960]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[1:51:34.960 --> 1:51:37.680]  That's where my Patriot supply comes in.

[1:52:05.760 --> 1:52:07.600]  in stock at m4store.com.
[1:52:07.600 --> 1:52:11.360]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week, I thought it would be a six-month
[1:52:11.360 --> 1:52:12.360]  supply for listeners.
[1:52:12.360 --> 1:52:16.600]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their
[1:52:16.600 --> 1:52:17.600]  Super Blue.
[1:52:17.600 --> 1:52:19.480]  Research across the board is clear.
[1:52:19.480 --> 1:52:20.800]  In fact, it's certified.
[1:52:20.800 --> 1:52:24.680]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood
[1:52:24.680 --> 1:52:25.960]  clots and heart attacks.
[1:52:25.960 --> 1:52:30.400]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:32.920]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[1:52:32.920 --> 1:52:37.080]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen
[1:52:37.080 --> 1:52:39.440]  iodine, so the bad halogen fluoride.
[1:52:39.440 --> 1:52:43.920]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out
[1:52:43.920 --> 1:52:46.360]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:52:46.360 --> 1:52:50.760]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[1:52:50.760 --> 1:52:53.840]  peppermint oil, iodine, nanosilver and more.

[1:54:00.480 --> 1:54:07.080]  All right, final segment with Joe Biggs, Laura Lemmer, we'll do five more minutes
[1:54:07.080 --> 1:54:08.080]  for us in the next hour.
[1:54:08.080 --> 1:54:10.440]  Then I'm opening the phones up in the third hour.
[1:54:10.440 --> 1:54:14.400]  Then Paul Watson will host the fourth hour from London, England, always powerful.
[1:54:14.400 --> 1:54:20.040]  I haven't really gotten into North Korea, the liberal wonderland and how the left was
[1:54:20.040 --> 1:54:22.720]  saying they basically hoped he would die.
[1:54:22.720 --> 1:54:26.640]  Well, Otto Warmberg did die.
[1:54:26.640 --> 1:54:29.800]  That's all coming up as well in the next hour.
[1:54:29.800 --> 1:54:36.040]  Briefly, before we go back to Laura Lemmer who has so much courage to actually go up
[1:54:36.040 --> 1:54:42.640]  on a stage in front of people and speak the truth to a bunch of crazed death cult worshipers.
[1:54:42.640 --> 1:54:48.040]  They're having a simulated murder porn orgy.
[1:54:48.040 --> 1:54:49.400]  So say what you want about her.
[1:54:49.400 --> 1:54:53.920]  She has got guts and I salute her and I thank her and they said she was a paid activist
[1:54:53.920 --> 1:54:54.920]  when she wasn't.
[1:54:54.920 --> 1:54:58.040]  So I'm going to send her, I think I said a couple thousand bucks.
[1:54:58.040 --> 1:55:04.160]  I need to get her contact information because we have our $200,000 contest going, exposing
[1:55:04.160 --> 1:55:07.320]  CNN as ISIS, exposing mainstream media as terrorists.
[1:55:07.320 --> 1:55:10.600]  If you can get infowars.com in, that's fine.
[1:55:10.600 --> 1:55:15.040]  But even though she really wasn't part of the contest, I want to take liberal lies and
[1:55:15.040 --> 1:55:16.760]  with alchemy make them true.
[1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:19.680]  She wasn't a paid activist, but now she is.
[1:55:19.680 --> 1:55:21.120]  She deserves awards.
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:24.120]  She deserves to be put on a pedestal for her guts.
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:25.120]  No guts, no glory.
[1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:28.760]  We'll get final comments from Joe Biggs and then from her here in a moment.
[1:55:28.760 --> 1:55:34.080]  Briefly, help fund our $200,000 contest by getting the image of Kathy Griffin and Trump's
[1:55:34.080 --> 1:55:37.480]  head chopped off saying CNN terrorist.
[1:55:37.480 --> 1:55:41.480]  There's other variants as well that says fake news.
[1:55:41.480 --> 1:55:43.720]  There's other t-shirts that we sell as well.
[1:55:43.720 --> 1:55:45.320]  It's all about meeting like-minded people.
[1:55:45.320 --> 1:55:46.960]  It's all about getting back on their face.
[1:55:46.960 --> 1:55:52.960]  It's all about spreading the word and starting conversations and exercising the First Amendment
[1:55:52.960 --> 1:55:54.600]  or losing it.
[1:55:54.600 --> 1:55:57.000]  And we have store-wide free shipping for a few more days.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:00.320]  I don't think I'm going to keep this to the free shipping with some of the big specials
[1:56:00.320 --> 1:56:03.440]  we've got because we're about to sell out of a lot of products.
[1:56:03.440 --> 1:56:08.200]  But right now, we've got 30% off the good halogen X2, learn the secrets of nascent iodine
[1:56:08.200 --> 1:56:15.320]  and why ours is the best, get Z-Shield, known herbs and shilligy and zeolites that detoxify
[1:56:15.320 --> 1:56:17.560]  the heavy metals and toxins out of your body.
[1:56:17.560 --> 1:56:21.200]  That is a brand new product, really popular, 30% off out of the gate.
[1:56:21.200 --> 1:56:23.520]  I want you to get introduced to it.
[1:56:23.520 --> 1:56:29.280]  30% to 40% off all of my Patriots supply food that we then private label and full-war select
[1:56:29.280 --> 1:56:33.880]  to be able to sell it for 30%, 40% below what anybody else can.
[1:56:33.880 --> 1:56:38.880]  Water filters the very best, lowest prices on Pro Pure, Alexa Pure and others that blowaway
[1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:41.160]  all the other gravity-fed filters.
[1:56:41.160 --> 1:56:45.000]  We have the side-by-side comparisons at infowarstore.com.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:48.400]  But whatever you do, continue to support the broadcast because we're trying to support
[1:56:48.400 --> 1:56:52.360]  activists and Patriots all over the world, not just here.
[1:56:52.360 --> 1:56:56.240]  And our talking points of liberty are leading the fight against the globalist.
[1:56:56.240 --> 1:56:59.560]  I'll have a few comments in the next little segment from Laura Loomer.
[1:56:59.560 --> 1:57:03.120]  But from you, Joe Biggs, final points you'd like to impart, you're going to be in studio
[1:57:03.120 --> 1:57:04.120]  tomorrow co-hosting.
[1:57:04.120 --> 1:57:05.520]  Roger that.
[1:57:05.520 --> 1:57:08.520]  So what's happening right now is the world's changing around us.
[1:57:08.520 --> 1:57:12.720]  What we have to start doing is understanding how that world's changing around us so we
[1:57:12.720 --> 1:57:14.600]  don't become victims.
[1:57:14.600 --> 1:57:16.600]  Like I said, there is a war going on.
[1:57:16.600 --> 1:57:18.400]  Many people don't realize it.
[1:57:18.400 --> 1:57:23.440]  But we are the targets of a violent radical leftist movement.
[1:57:23.440 --> 1:57:27.200]  And we're also the targets from radical Islamic Jihadi terrorists.
[1:57:27.200 --> 1:57:32.360]  So we have to be on that extra lookout, break that complacency, learn to think outside of
[1:57:32.360 --> 1:57:34.320]  that box you normally are.
[1:57:34.320 --> 1:57:35.840]  Don't put yourself in a comfort zone.
[1:57:35.840 --> 1:57:39.160]  Put yourself in an uncomfortable situation mentally.
[1:57:39.160 --> 1:57:43.080]  Prepare yourself and be ready for these violent attacks.
[1:57:43.080 --> 1:57:45.520]  Now don't ever go out and violently do something first.
[1:57:45.520 --> 1:57:50.080]  But in a defensive manner, if you are attacked, you should always have something pre-planned
[1:57:50.080 --> 1:57:54.040]  in your head and ready to react at that point in time.
[1:57:54.040 --> 1:57:56.520]  Break out of that complacency, change your mindset.
[1:57:56.520 --> 1:58:02.400]  It's important right now because like I said, we are the targets from a very violent radical
[1:58:02.400 --> 1:58:03.880]  leftist movement.
[1:58:03.880 --> 1:58:05.160]  And they're gaining momentum.
[1:58:05.160 --> 1:58:10.400]  And the best thing we can do is to be ready for that and have a clear path to that way
[1:58:10.400 --> 1:58:11.400]  that we can do something.
[1:58:11.400 --> 1:58:14.440]  Joe, how do folks follow you on Twitter and Facebook?
[1:58:14.440 --> 1:58:19.160]  At Rambo Biggs and then go to just Joe Biggs on Facebook, trust me, you'll know the picture.
[1:58:19.160 --> 1:58:23.200]  I usually have a grizzly bear suit on or I'm holding my daughter, so.
[1:58:23.200 --> 1:58:25.400]  Or both.
[1:58:25.400 --> 1:58:26.840]  That's America right there.
[1:58:26.840 --> 1:58:27.840]  Oh yeah.
[1:58:27.840 --> 1:58:30.800]  And folks, America isn't perfect, but compared to North Korea and most of their places, it's
[1:58:30.800 --> 1:58:31.800]  great.
[1:58:31.800 --> 1:58:32.800]  That's where we're from.
[1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:33.800]  That's why we're promoting it.
[1:58:33.800 --> 1:58:36.360]  And we're hoping to spread it through peace worldwide.
[1:58:36.360 --> 1:58:40.400]  Third hour straight ahead, final comments from Laura Lerner, then your phone calls and
[1:58:40.400 --> 1:58:41.400]  more.
[1:58:41.400 --> 1:58:42.400]  Stay with us.
[1:58:42.400 --> 1:58:54.440]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCN live.com today, not a group you develop living defense
[1:58:54.440 --> 1:58:55.440]  for us.
[1:58:55.440 --> 1:58:56.440]  It took you over a year to do it.
[1:58:56.440 --> 1:58:57.940]  Why is this so good?
[1:58:57.940 --> 1:59:02.400]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[1:59:02.400 --> 1:59:07.240]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[1:59:07.240 --> 1:59:08.240]  my system.
[1:59:08.240 --> 1:59:14.240]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[1:59:14.240 --> 1:59:20.040]  that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[1:59:20.040 --> 1:59:22.640]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[1:59:22.640 --> 1:59:23.640]  These are all parasites.
[1:59:23.640 --> 1:59:26.360]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[1:59:26.360 --> 1:59:27.600]  You have the neem in there.
[1:59:27.600 --> 1:59:30.680]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[1:59:30.680 --> 1:59:33.960]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[1:59:33.960 --> 1:59:34.960]  All right.
[1:59:34.960 --> 1:59:37.160]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[1:59:37.160 --> 1:59:40.160]  I just came back in yesterday, living defense, infowarslife.com.
[1:59:40.160 --> 1:59:41.160]  And folks, you can't lose.
[1:59:41.160 --> 1:59:44.000]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:47.280]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[1:59:47.280 --> 1:59:49.480]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[1:59:49.480 --> 1:59:55.440]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[1:59:55.440 --> 2:00:14.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:14.920 --> 2:00:20.680]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[2:00:20.680 --> 2:00:23.240]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:00:23.240 --> 2:00:30.840]  Well, her actions, along with Jack Mesobit covering it, was the number one story last
[2:00:30.840 --> 2:00:33.360]  weekend.
[2:00:33.360 --> 2:00:38.280]  And then in the next few days, more people storm the stage to say stop promoting murder.
[2:00:38.280 --> 2:00:39.280]  Here's some of that video.
[2:00:39.280 --> 2:00:55.320]  We're going to pause, we're going to pause, security, security, please.
[2:00:55.320 --> 2:01:10.640]  Now, I mean, these are the people that love this stuff, everybody else's events.
[2:01:10.640 --> 2:01:15.640]  And I thought it was so anti-free speech when she did it.
[2:01:15.640 --> 2:01:16.640]  You are all gerbils.
[2:01:16.640 --> 2:01:20.640]  You are all Nazis like Joseph Gerbils.
[2:01:20.640 --> 2:01:22.040]  This is Gerbils.
[2:01:22.040 --> 2:01:23.440]  You are all Gerbils.
[2:01:23.440 --> 2:01:26.520]  Imagine if Trump had rallies, resimulated the death of Obama.
[2:01:26.520 --> 2:01:32.320]  I mean, the left got a rodeo clown who was Hispanic, looking like Obama as a clown band.
[2:01:32.320 --> 2:01:39.840]  But then they want to be able to simulate killing the president, which is their free
[2:01:39.840 --> 2:01:41.960]  speech, and people are going to protest it.
[2:01:41.960 --> 2:01:47.280]  Then they play games and say, oh, we're not really talking about the president.
[2:01:47.280 --> 2:01:50.000]  Laura, just in the last few minutes, we've got to commend what you're doing.
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.880]  Obviously, more of this is going to happen because we're not left-wing or right-wing,
[2:01:52.880 --> 2:01:53.880]  some of you.
[2:01:53.880 --> 2:01:57.400]  We're just responding because they're bullying, so I commend you for fighting these bullies.
[2:01:57.400 --> 2:02:00.360]  Thank you so much, and you're a source of inspiration to me.
[2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:04.240]  I definitely have been an info warrior for a long time now.
[2:02:04.240 --> 2:02:07.800]  People like Mike Cernovich, people like the Rebel Media, James O'Keefe over at Project
[2:02:07.800 --> 2:02:09.680]  Bear Toss where I used to work.
[2:02:09.680 --> 2:02:14.400]  All of you are leading the fight against the left, and the mainstream media sure as hell
[2:02:14.400 --> 2:02:15.400]  isn't doing it.
[2:02:15.400 --> 2:02:20.760]  So I would encourage people to follow you and follow those others who are leading this
[2:02:20.760 --> 2:02:28.320]  fight against this toxic etiology, this culture war that is attacking the right that's calling
[2:02:28.320 --> 2:02:31.800]  for a conservative genocide.
[2:02:31.800 --> 2:02:35.080]  Why do you think you're so violent now?
[2:02:35.080 --> 2:02:37.360]  I really honestly attribute it to Islam.
[2:02:37.360 --> 2:02:42.960]  A lot of people don't make the connection, but the left, throughout Obama's presidency
[2:02:42.960 --> 2:02:48.360]  especially, they decided to align themselves with Islam, and these are Islamic tactics.
[2:02:48.360 --> 2:02:50.000]  This is jihad.
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:52.240]  This is the left swarm of jihad.
[2:02:52.240 --> 2:02:58.000]  They're using ISIS tactics of beheading, stabbing people, running over people in cars.
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:04.120]  In fact, a lot of leftists, as you know, celebrate the jihadist attacks that are taking place.
[2:03:04.120 --> 2:03:07.120]  Yeah, of course, because why wouldn't they?
[2:03:07.120 --> 2:03:11.080]  Because they don't stand for the West.
[2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:13.080]  They don't stand for the Constitution, right?
[2:03:13.080 --> 2:03:17.080]  Jihad is opposed to the West, and it wants to destroy Western civilization and everything
[2:03:17.080 --> 2:03:21.960]  that's good about democracy and the United States Constitution, and Sharia law is totally
[2:03:21.960 --> 2:03:28.640]  incompatible with the United States Constitution, and we already have 51% of the Muslims living
[2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:32.240]  in this country already want to replace the Constitution with Sharia law, and so if we
[2:03:32.240 --> 2:03:36.200]  keep on importing these people, they're going to start to influence the West.
[2:03:36.200 --> 2:03:37.200]  Exactly.
[2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:40.920]  I'm all for bringing Muslims in if they want to adapt and don't want to put hoods over
[2:03:40.920 --> 2:03:44.320]  their wives' heads and cut their genitals off and stuff like that.
[2:03:44.320 --> 2:03:48.040]  You know, Christians in some areas 1,000 years ago did similar things, not exactly
[2:03:48.040 --> 2:03:49.040]  that bad, but similar.
[2:03:49.040 --> 2:03:54.200]  They've got a reform, but instead they say, we are reforming, ISIS is our reform.
[2:03:54.200 --> 2:03:58.600]  Yeah, I mean, there is no reform, right?
[2:03:58.600 --> 2:04:02.720]  What people need to understand is there has not been a reform movement with Islam.
[2:04:02.720 --> 2:04:06.160]  There has not been a moderate movement with Islam, right?
[2:04:06.160 --> 2:04:10.040]  There is only one Quran, and you know, it's their etiology.
[2:04:10.040 --> 2:04:11.040]  It's their...
[2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:16.400]  Why has Christianity and Judaism and so many other religions gotten more moderate over
[2:04:16.400 --> 2:04:20.440]  the last few thousand years, and Islam gets worse and worse?
[2:04:20.440 --> 2:04:27.440]  Yeah, I mean, a lot of people, I personally view Islam as more of a death cult.
[2:04:27.440 --> 2:04:29.240]  You know, I try and stay away from...
[2:04:29.240 --> 2:04:30.240]  No, no, I agree.
[2:04:30.240 --> 2:04:31.240]  It's not a religion.
[2:04:31.240 --> 2:04:32.720]  It's a political death cult.
[2:04:32.720 --> 2:04:36.640]  I don't call it a religion, so that's your answer right there.
[2:04:36.640 --> 2:04:38.160]  It's not a religion.
[2:04:38.160 --> 2:04:44.560]  So it's not like Christianity or Judaism, because it's a death cult.
[2:04:44.560 --> 2:04:48.160]  Well, it certainly is being exercised as one today.
[2:04:48.160 --> 2:04:49.960]  Laura Loomer, thank you so much for joining us.
[2:04:49.960 --> 2:04:51.960]  Where's the best place again for folks to follow you?
[2:04:51.960 --> 2:04:55.880]  Just at Laura Loomer and the Rebel Media.
[2:04:55.880 --> 2:04:57.080]  Rebel Media doing a lot of great work.
[2:04:57.080 --> 2:05:00.040]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back with your phone calls a ton of news.
[2:05:00.040 --> 2:05:03.040]  Stay with us.
[2:05:03.040 --> 2:05:06.120]  It looks like the summer of rage has claimed another victim.
[2:05:06.120 --> 2:05:08.120]  Report on infowars.com.
[2:05:08.120 --> 2:05:10.360]  One gang stabs prominent Trump activist.
[2:05:10.360 --> 2:05:15.120]  27-year-old Tony Freeman was stabbed by a gang of Armenians who noticed his pro-Trump
[2:05:15.120 --> 2:05:18.200]  bumper sticker on his car after they rammed his vehicle.
[2:05:18.200 --> 2:05:21.600]  After the ramming, the gang members noticed his Gadsden flag and American flag bumper
[2:05:21.600 --> 2:05:24.880]  stickers and proceeded to stab him nine times.
[2:05:24.880 --> 2:05:28.680]  Mr. Freeman was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where he remains in critical
[2:05:28.680 --> 2:05:33.240]  condition and you can donate to Foreman's Emergency Medical Fund at Wesearcher.
[2:05:33.240 --> 2:05:36.840]  Santa Monica police are treating the attack as racially motivated, but we've seen the
[2:05:36.840 --> 2:05:40.840]  many statements from Tim Kaine calling for fights in the streets to Loretta Lynch calling
[2:05:40.840 --> 2:05:43.520]  for marching blood and death in the streets.
[2:05:43.520 --> 2:05:48.040]  Democratic leaders across the country from Bernie Sanders to Hillary Clinton to Maxine
[2:05:48.040 --> 2:05:53.000]  Waters and Nancy Pelosi are all calling for people to rise up and resist this summer during
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  the summer of rage.
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:56.000]  Who will be the next victim?
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:05:57.960]  Watch your back or it may be you.
[2:05:57.960 --> 2:06:03.800]  Rob Dew reporting for infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.

[2:06:24.720 --> 2:06:25.880]  I don't feel good.
[2:06:25.880 --> 2:06:29.520]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[2:06:29.520 --> 2:06:32.280]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my super female.
[2:06:32.280 --> 2:06:38.360]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[2:06:38.360 --> 2:06:39.360]  Very exciting.
[2:06:39.360 --> 2:06:40.360]  Feeling great.
[2:06:40.360 --> 2:06:41.360]  Looking good.
[2:06:41.360 --> 2:06:44.680]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[2:06:44.680 --> 2:06:46.800]  So obviously a super female is amazing.
[2:06:46.800 --> 2:06:47.800]  I love it.
[2:06:47.800 --> 2:06:50.480]  Nascent iodine is essential.

[2:08:44.240 --> 2:08:46.040]  We are back live.
[2:08:46.040 --> 2:08:47.040]  Let's rock them up.
[2:08:47.040 --> 2:08:48.040]  Let's take your calls.
[2:08:48.040 --> 2:08:52.760]  I'm pretty good at talk radio, I love America and I'm good at analyzing globalist operations
[2:08:52.760 --> 2:08:55.520]  but I'm not good at going bam, bam, bam taking your calls.
[2:08:55.520 --> 2:08:59.040]  I want to hear from military, I want to hear from police, I want to hear from citizens,
[2:08:59.040 --> 2:09:02.520]  I want to hear from people no matter what color you are or where you're from about the state
[2:09:02.520 --> 2:09:03.520]  of the world.
[2:09:03.520 --> 2:09:07.960]  Do you agree with me that Trump is really battling the globalist trying to get as much
[2:09:07.960 --> 2:09:11.720]  as he can done killing so many big new world order operations?
[2:09:11.720 --> 2:09:13.320]  You know a man by his enemies?
[2:09:13.320 --> 2:09:15.440]  He's totally surrounded by hyenas.
[2:09:15.440 --> 2:09:21.760]  He just tears my heart out and my intellect out that I can't do more to defend free humanity
[2:09:21.760 --> 2:09:24.520]  trying to break free from globalism.
[2:09:24.520 --> 2:09:29.320]  And you've got the poor American dying in the North Korean custody and liberals celebrating
[2:09:29.320 --> 2:09:31.440]  it and making jokes because he's white.
[2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:34.880]  They see Asian white so if the white man dies they win.
[2:09:34.880 --> 2:09:38.720]  This is total beyond KKK mental illness.
[2:09:38.720 --> 2:09:45.120]  We're going to get into so many other big subjects here as well today on the economy,
[2:09:45.120 --> 2:09:47.560]  on science discoveries and so much more.
[2:09:47.560 --> 2:09:59.400]  But the toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231, that's 800-2599-231 on any of the subjects.
[2:09:59.400 --> 2:10:04.120]  And I ask the question, should we when the leftists come up with guns or knives or clubs
[2:10:04.120 --> 2:10:09.120]  get in a fetal position and say, I apologize that you might hurt your wrist hitting me
[2:10:09.120 --> 2:10:14.080]  with a baseball bat, I'm bad please kill me because the media is saying that conservatives
[2:10:14.080 --> 2:10:19.760]  allowing themselves to be stabbed, allowing themselves to be shot is not enough and that
[2:10:19.760 --> 2:10:24.520]  congressmen deserve to be shot, it's time to hunt Republicans, it's time to kill everybody,
[2:10:24.520 --> 2:10:28.360]  it's time to murder everybody, this is their rhetoric.
[2:10:28.360 --> 2:10:31.920]  Then they'll take what I've said out of context to claim I want violence.
[2:10:31.920 --> 2:10:37.040]  I don't want offensive violence, I don't want to have a bloodletting, I won't feel powerful.
[2:10:37.040 --> 2:10:41.720]  You know if there's a societal collapse and a horde of 30, you know, trendies starving
[2:10:41.720 --> 2:10:46.280]  to death come up my country driveway, you know, with clubs and weapons and I've got to open
[2:10:46.280 --> 2:10:50.520]  up from them, you know, from concealment because that's literally like putting a bunch of dead
[2:10:50.520 --> 2:10:52.560]  zombies on my front yard.
[2:10:52.560 --> 2:10:56.800]  I want to unlock the zombie brains, I want them to understand how the ultra rich are
[2:10:56.800 --> 2:11:01.360]  manipulating them into collectivism so there's no middle class, no upper mobility.
[2:11:01.360 --> 2:11:07.280]  I want them to look at the real science and metrics so that they understand the facts
[2:11:07.280 --> 2:11:14.480]  of history and that capitalism creates incredible wealth, it creates incredibly rich elites
[2:11:14.480 --> 2:11:19.240]  and those robber barons always then try to pull up the ladder and make sure the rest
[2:11:19.240 --> 2:11:25.200]  of the public stays poor but capitalism and free market creates fantastic wealth and medicine
[2:11:25.200 --> 2:11:30.960]  and science and technology and choice and innovation like nothing has in history.
[2:11:30.960 --> 2:11:37.200]  It is the renaissance, it's only been partially realized at America's peak, maybe 30%, right
[2:11:37.200 --> 2:11:43.640]  now maybe 10% of it's been realized, we're in decline but we can explode back into a
[2:11:43.640 --> 2:11:46.280]  flowering period anytime we want.
[2:11:46.280 --> 2:11:51.320]  The problem is the paradox that it creates so much wealth and so much choice and so much
[2:11:51.320 --> 2:12:02.120]  decadence that our children and their children and their children, that's us, become decadent.
[2:12:02.120 --> 2:12:08.280]  So I don't care if you're a Hispanic immigrant, a European immigrant, an African immigrant,
[2:12:08.280 --> 2:12:11.720]  an Asian immigrant, it doesn't matter.
[2:12:11.720 --> 2:12:16.480]  First generation that comes here legally lawfully to work is super hard working, amazing moral
[2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:20.840]  because they come from really dangerous hell holes and people appreciate the freedom.
[2:12:20.840 --> 2:12:25.080]  Second generation a little more lazy, goes to college, the college fills them full of
[2:12:25.080 --> 2:12:28.880]  poison for the nation, fills them full of division, that's because the big banks own
[2:12:28.880 --> 2:12:33.000]  those colleges and run them and want you to be screwed up, they want you to have a worthless
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:36.760]  degree, they want you to be under their control.
[2:12:36.760 --> 2:12:41.440]  Then the next generation of those people gets even more spoiled brat and even more hateful
[2:12:41.440 --> 2:12:44.600]  and basically here we are today.
[2:12:44.600 --> 2:12:48.480]  You look at what conditions were like on average 80 years ago in this country, they were hellish.
[2:12:48.480 --> 2:12:52.440]  Now they were a lot better than they were in other countries but if you look at the
[2:12:52.440 --> 2:12:58.440]  graph we're only going upward until about the 1990s and we've been going downward since,
[2:12:58.440 --> 2:13:04.960]  we need to reverse the downward spiral innovation, wealth, creation, free market is the answer
[2:13:04.960 --> 2:13:09.960]  but it doesn't allow Bezos to have a global monopoly over trades and goods.
[2:13:09.960 --> 2:13:13.640]  It doesn't let Goldman Sachs have a global monopoly over investment banking.
[2:13:13.640 --> 2:13:18.280]  It doesn't let JP Morgan have a global monopoly over consumer banking and stocks and bonds.
[2:13:18.280 --> 2:13:22.280]  It doesn't let the monopoly men have their system.
[2:13:22.280 --> 2:13:26.000]  Read the books written by John D. Rockefeller and John D. II.
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:29.560]  Read the books written by D. Rockefeller, read the books written by Henry Kissinger,
[2:13:29.560 --> 2:13:34.880]  read the books written by Brazilian Ski, I've read them, I've read them, I've read
[2:13:34.880 --> 2:13:40.400]  their writings, I know them, I know who they are, I know who their scam is, I know they
[2:13:40.400 --> 2:13:45.880]  think your failure is stupid and hate you, I know they think that you're losers so why
[2:13:45.880 --> 2:13:50.080]  should they not dumb you down and give you a failed ideology of collectivism which they
[2:13:50.080 --> 2:13:54.000]  then control and are exempt from.
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:57.920]  It is absolute fact that North Korea is a hellhole, that Venezuela is a hellhole.
[2:13:57.920 --> 2:14:01.760]  It's an absolute fact that Cuba is a hellhole.
[2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:06.760]  It's an absolute fact that anywhere under communism is a nightmare but again the leftists
[2:14:06.760 --> 2:14:11.520]  run around mindlessly with the big banks and the big billionaires pushing it, pushing
[2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:19.160]  it, pushing it as cultural poison like weights, like balls and chains to slow down humanity.
[2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:22.400]  Go read their writings for yourself.
[2:14:22.400 --> 2:14:27.160]  Brian, Hans, Cynthia, James, Brandon and others, your phone calls right now and you hear somebody
[2:14:27.160 --> 2:14:33.920]  hang up, that's your chance to call in 800-25-99231.
[2:14:33.920 --> 2:14:41.480]  Then coming up, Hannity agrees with Alex Jones, demands NBC release the tapes of the
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:42.720]  Alex Jones interview.
[2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:49.480]  We're also going to get into several other key reports that I haven't gotten to yet.
[2:14:49.480 --> 2:14:57.360]  Larry Wilmore roasted Otto Warmbier, made fun of him on Comedy Central and many other
[2:14:57.360 --> 2:15:02.280]  publications did like Huffington Post, now he's dead.
[2:15:02.280 --> 2:15:07.280]  Theresa May calls for Internet censorship and a police state to counter Islamophobia
[2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:10.760]  that she helped bring in and empower and that's the right wing government doing that.
[2:15:10.760 --> 2:15:16.960]  They bring in the incompatible Stone Age population, gosh they've dug up Stone Age systems all
[2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:21.240]  over the world from Mesoamerica to Europe to Asia and they didn't treat women like
[2:15:21.240 --> 2:15:22.240]  that.
[2:15:22.240 --> 2:15:25.600]  Women were actually the center of the home and they basically worshipped as goddesses.
[2:15:25.600 --> 2:15:31.200]  You study every ancient culture that before agrarianism kicked in, I mean why not, she
[2:15:31.200 --> 2:15:36.800]  can make babies, she's got milk, she's warm, she's squishy, she's nice.
[2:15:36.800 --> 2:15:41.680]  So I shouldn't insult Stone Age peoples because they were all universally hidden to press women.
[2:15:41.680 --> 2:15:46.080]  There were some smaller tribes that would kidnap and enslave others but that didn't last long
[2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:50.720]  in different periods, it was normally to make you breed with them so you're only the slave
[2:15:50.720 --> 2:15:55.320]  class the first generation but that gets into complex anthropology.
[2:15:55.320 --> 2:16:03.680]  The point is that Islam if you study history in its current orthodox form is the most barbarous,
[2:16:03.680 --> 2:16:09.040]  backward, hateful, anti-freedom system there is and the globalist are allied with it because
[2:16:09.040 --> 2:16:10.920]  it's helping bring in their world government.
[2:16:10.920 --> 2:16:14.800]  So that's why I'm anti-authoritarianism so I am Islamophobic.
[2:16:14.800 --> 2:16:21.080]  I am Islamophobic, I am Islamophobic, I am phobic of black widow spiders for a reason.
[2:16:21.080 --> 2:16:25.080]  I've seen it kill somebody I know, I'm phobic of brown recluses because I see somebody lose
[2:16:25.080 --> 2:16:29.200]  their leg from one, I'm phobic of pit bulls running out of somebody's garage and biting
[2:16:29.200 --> 2:16:31.040]  somebody because I've seen it happen.
[2:16:31.040 --> 2:16:35.200]  I am phobic of you know heights because I see people fall off a cliff.
[2:16:35.200 --> 2:16:39.760]  I have these instincts for a reason, they're trying to get us to not follow our basic common
[2:16:39.760 --> 2:16:40.760]  sense.
[2:16:40.760 --> 2:16:49.040]  All right let's go ahead and go to Brian in Wisconsin, Brian you're on the air go ahead.
[2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:51.840]  Hey Alex good to talk to you.
[2:16:51.840 --> 2:16:54.840]  Thank you brother, thanks for calling.
[2:16:54.840 --> 2:16:55.840]  Thanks.
[2:16:55.840 --> 2:17:03.440]  I was just curious if you remember that Connie Chung interview of Newt Gingrich's mom.
[2:17:03.440 --> 2:17:06.960]  Oh she was so mean.
[2:17:06.960 --> 2:17:18.120]  Yeah well Connie wanted to know what Newt thought about Hillary and Connie's mom said
[2:17:18.120 --> 2:17:24.320]  well I can't tell you that and Connie said oh come on you can tell me it's just between
[2:17:24.320 --> 2:17:36.520]  you and me and then Newt's mom goes well he said she's a BITCH I don't know if I can
[2:17:36.520 --> 2:17:39.280]  say that or not.
[2:17:39.280 --> 2:17:43.200]  But I remember that and then Connie Chung's ratings went from bad to almost zero and she
[2:17:43.200 --> 2:17:48.640]  got fired or they put her like magazine shows which is how they put them out in the pasture.
[2:17:48.640 --> 2:17:54.160]  You're right and now her ratings, Megan's have gone from 6 million to 3.5 they say they're
[2:17:54.160 --> 2:17:58.960]  looking for an exit of her and they're saying it but even the New York Post is saying or
[2:17:58.960 --> 2:18:03.480]  the New Yorkers saying before Megan Kelly Connie Chung was the female anchor Trump
[2:18:03.480 --> 2:18:04.760]  hated most.
[2:18:04.760 --> 2:18:08.840]  So are you about to say what I think you're about to say that this will be her waterloo
[2:18:08.840 --> 2:18:09.840]  as well?
[2:18:09.840 --> 2:18:14.640]  Well that's what I was thinking because that's what happened to Connie Chung after that that
[2:18:14.640 --> 2:18:16.960]  really turned off a lot of people.
[2:18:16.960 --> 2:18:21.320]  Well I know there's even liberals everywhere hate Megan Kelly now I mean everybody could
[2:18:21.320 --> 2:18:23.440]  see it was totally edited it was a joke.
[2:18:23.440 --> 2:18:29.680]  Yeah maybe that's something you guys could do is make a video comparing the two interviews.
[2:18:29.680 --> 2:18:35.240]  I just wrote down what you said you know is Megan Kelly the most deceptive interviewer
[2:18:35.240 --> 2:18:42.520]  ever and then like coming up look at Connie Chung look at who was the lady that got caught
[2:18:42.520 --> 2:18:47.480]  editing the gun video so they sounded like morons Katie Couric who is the most deceptive
[2:18:47.480 --> 2:18:54.680]  let me ask you is it Connie Chung, Katie Couric or is it Megan Kelly?
[2:18:54.680 --> 2:18:59.960]  Well I was I don't know what to say I'd have to say Megan Kelly.
[2:18:59.960 --> 2:19:06.680]  And we're not bashing women here there are other deceptive reporters but it coming to
[2:19:06.680 --> 2:19:11.600]  mind for being the most deceptive and lying to people off record and not being off record
[2:19:11.600 --> 2:19:13.800]  it does seem like they're kind of the queens of this.
[2:19:13.800 --> 2:19:17.320]  Who's another really deceptive reporter that's a man?
[2:19:17.320 --> 2:19:21.240]  I mean a lot of the men will just tell you you will and take a hard interview I'm coming
[2:19:21.240 --> 2:19:24.240]  down there and then they come into a hard interview and kind of edit stuff but nothing
[2:19:24.240 --> 2:19:27.720]  like a woman does at least from experience I mean you think that's right do they use
[2:19:27.720 --> 2:19:31.080]  the fact that they're a woman so they're allowed to cheat is that some liberal feminist thing
[2:19:31.080 --> 2:19:32.080]  what do you think?
[2:19:32.080 --> 2:19:39.200]  I have no idea I can't think of a man being that deceptive in that way.
[2:19:39.200 --> 2:19:43.400]  Now Wolf Blitzer just pretty much agreed with you know shooting the congressman you know
[2:19:43.400 --> 2:19:46.720]  he kind of had the gun to say he's not evil he was just sick of politics but Blitzer's
[2:19:46.720 --> 2:19:50.800]  like well here your opinion and kind of nods his head you know Blitzer at least lets us
[2:19:50.800 --> 2:19:56.000]  know what he thinks he's horrible he's evil but he's more on Brian Williams he's worse
[2:19:56.000 --> 2:19:57.640]  than all three women.
[2:19:57.640 --> 2:20:02.720]  Brian Williams I think he's the worst.
[2:20:02.720 --> 2:20:07.760]  By now you know that wireless technology like cell phones do in fact pose dangers to the

[2:24:01.440 --> 2:24:22.880]  If you just joined us we had an amazing caller on that brought back a piece of ancient history
[2:24:22.880 --> 2:24:33.920]  I'd forgotten about in like 1994, 1995, Connie Chung is interviewing Newt Gendricks' mother
[2:24:33.920 --> 2:24:41.160]  and then says this is off record between you and me during the filming, what does he really
[2:24:41.160 --> 2:24:42.160]  think of Hillary?
[2:24:42.160 --> 2:24:47.920]  Well, he thinks she's a bitch and then that blew up in her face and she ended up losing
[2:24:47.920 --> 2:24:52.600]  her anchoring job over it because the ratings went away.
[2:24:52.600 --> 2:24:55.600]  The same thing happened to Piers Morgan when I went on his show.
[2:24:55.600 --> 2:24:59.440]  His ratings were almost gone two weeks later.
[2:24:59.440 --> 2:25:06.880]  The same thing has happened to so many of these people and I think that we are seeing
[2:25:06.880 --> 2:25:10.880]  MSM's Waterloo, their fall because they're still so arrogant and they don't learn new
[2:25:10.880 --> 2:25:16.240]  tricks whether it's Brian Williams saying he got shot down in a helicopter when he didn't
[2:25:16.240 --> 2:25:19.720]  and all the other lies or whether it's Connie Chung saying oh this is off record don't worry
[2:25:19.720 --> 2:25:23.940]  or Megan Kelly saying I promise it's not a hit piece I promise we won't edit it I promise
[2:25:23.940 --> 2:25:27.280]  I really like you I'm obsessed with you and of course I knew it was going to be hit piece
[2:25:27.280 --> 2:25:29.800]  I wanted to see this that she'd lie like that.
[2:25:29.800 --> 2:25:33.120]  We put the tape out.
[2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:34.640]  So who is the most disingenuous?
[2:25:34.640 --> 2:25:37.520]  Who is the biggest liar in MSM?
[2:25:37.520 --> 2:25:41.720]  We should have a contest where people put out different videos and show the different lies
[2:25:41.720 --> 2:25:49.640]  and then have folks vote online at infowars.com but I'm going to post a clip later of that
[2:25:49.640 --> 2:25:55.080]  call if you just tuned in so you can hear it to infowars.com and then see folks were
[2:25:55.080 --> 2:25:58.960]  live on air but I'll now take that clip put it on the front of the caller put that out
[2:25:58.960 --> 2:26:03.640]  for a viral video to get people talking to just remember what liars these people are
[2:26:03.640 --> 2:26:09.360]  and celebrate what liars they are and by celebrate what a joke they are what villains oh there's
[2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:14.480]  the Legion of Doom again even though Alex is like a big fat sweating walrus and you know
[2:26:14.480 --> 2:26:19.080]  they cut him all up you know Alex has got his own problems but he's one of us we sure
[2:26:19.080 --> 2:26:27.640]  hate this lady had the worst ratings ever in fact when we put that piece together let's
[2:26:27.640 --> 2:26:32.000]  clip in the Connie Chung clip just because you guys found it in fact I'll play that the
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:41.280]  next segment I want to go back to your calls right now let's go ahead and talk to Hans
[2:26:41.280 --> 2:26:48.840]  in Pennsylvania hello Hans yeah hi Alex I got an email from a friend of mine a couple
[2:26:48.840 --> 2:26:54.440]  weeks ago I've been trying to get this information to you our customs people in Florida confiscated
[2:26:54.440 --> 2:27:01.600]  52 tons of smuggled guns and ammunition packaged as furniture and shipped in 14 Comex shipping
[2:27:01.600 --> 2:27:10.280]  containers from Muslim Turkey to a Muslim arms manufacturer in Florida and the stuff
[2:27:10.280 --> 2:27:16.680]  is packaged packaged as furniture and it looks like that company could easily have
[2:27:16.680 --> 2:27:23.680]  shipped those furniture items to Muslim mosques across the country I think this is a surreptitious
[2:27:23.680 --> 2:27:30.400]  way for them to arm the Muslims prior to an overt insurrection occurring and I think that
[2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:35.680]  there probably were more of these types of shipments that got through so this this may
[2:27:35.680 --> 2:27:40.240]  just be one of many shipments that they now want to be clear sir I remember back in the
[2:27:40.240 --> 2:27:45.280]  mid 90s going back to that time again it was in the front page of the Long Beach newspaper
[2:27:45.280 --> 2:27:51.760]  that they caught a whole container ship full of a bunch of containers of AK-47s fully auto
[2:27:51.760 --> 2:27:55.840]  from the People's Liberation Army that was supposed to be canned goods being smuggled
[2:27:55.840 --> 2:28:00.440]  into street gangs then the media always called that a rumor and said it was made up by us
[2:28:00.440 --> 2:28:04.760]  no I mean I have the copy of the newspaper it's in my first film America destroyed by
[2:28:04.760 --> 2:28:10.560]  design now in that case we had documentation is this in the news or do you have this from
[2:28:10.560 --> 2:28:14.960]  sources please tell me I have an email of an article
[2:28:14.960 --> 2:28:19.600]  with six photographs of customs going through these containers and showing the weapons that
[2:28:19.600 --> 2:28:20.600]  as they were
[2:28:20.600 --> 2:28:24.800]  listen we've had we've had ice reach out to us and customs and give us big breaking
[2:28:24.800 --> 2:28:29.480]  stories too when Obama was letting the illegals in outside law two years before they admitted
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:33.400]  it so I know customs does a great job and they're ordered to let stuff in you know to
[2:28:33.400 --> 2:28:37.840]  at least expose what's happening but it shows the bureaucracy though Trump's trying to tighten
[2:28:37.840 --> 2:28:43.680]  down on things but but you're saying from this source that they were able to stop it
[2:28:43.680 --> 2:28:47.440]  this particular shipment they stopped but who knows how many other shipments got through
[2:28:47.440 --> 2:28:53.400]  and it's an ideal way for them to use the packaged weapons and ship them through UPS
[2:28:53.400 --> 2:28:57.760]  or whoever to the individual mosques across the country they can ship tons of weapons
[2:28:57.760 --> 2:29:01.960]  to these people without anybody without anybody even knowing about it
[2:29:01.960 --> 2:29:07.520]  I'm gonna look for the story that you talked about but regardless shipping in in the Europe
[2:29:07.520 --> 2:29:11.640]  five six million they say it's been ten million it's the last few years according to the UN
[2:29:11.640 --> 2:29:16.240]  total Islamic refugees in the West hundreds and hundreds of thousands here the numbers
[2:29:16.240 --> 2:29:20.120]  are much higher Obama kept those secret Trump's just trying to find out what happened and
[2:29:20.120 --> 2:29:23.200]  the State Department and Congress are just blocking him along with the courts that's
[2:29:23.200 --> 2:29:27.240]  the level of sedition but if you bring in a bunch of military aged men who are admittedly
[2:29:27.240 --> 2:29:31.720]  jihadis it's the same as bringing the weapons in in fact it's more dangerous so I think
[2:29:31.720 --> 2:29:35.840]  your story is very very plausible we'll research it and look into it because that we know that
[2:29:35.840 --> 2:29:42.600]  God isn't dangerous it's the jihadi globalist pedophile brain so thank you so much Hans
[2:29:42.600 --> 2:29:47.080]  we'll look into that right now send us any of those emails to show tips and info wars
[2:29:47.080 --> 2:29:51.400]  dot com you're the eyes and ears of the republic Cynthia James Travis your calls are straight
[2:29:51.400 --> 2:30:03.000]  ahead we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[2:30:03.000 --> 2:30:06.760]  one thing I love to talk about is liberal hypocrisy today I want to talk about Ben and
[2:30:06.760 --> 2:30:10.120]  Jerry's the ice cream makers out of Vermont at the end of last year they wrote an open
[2:30:10.120 --> 2:30:13.360]  letter to President Trump where they talked about how they are strong advocates for racial
[2:30:13.360 --> 2:30:18.280]  social justice women people of color Muslims migrants refugees the poor and those who are
[2:30:18.280 --> 2:30:22.560]  further compromised by the policies and rhetoric you espouse during your campaign well over
[2:30:22.560 --> 2:30:26.880]  the weekend scores of farm workers and activists marched on Ben and Jerry's why because the
[2:30:26.880 --> 2:30:30.600]  migrant farm workers don't like the way they are being treated by the farms that provide
[2:30:30.600 --> 2:30:34.520]  milk to Ben and Jerry's and these migrant farm workers many of whom are illegal started
[2:30:34.520 --> 2:30:39.320]  the milk with dignity program in 2014 with a Vermont group migrant justice to ensure
[2:30:39.320 --> 2:30:43.040]  farms provide migrant workers some of which are illegal fair wages working conditions
[2:30:43.040 --> 2:30:47.440]  and decent housing in 2015 Ben and Jerry's agreed to join the program but they're still
[2:30:47.440 --> 2:30:51.400]  stuck in negotiations so will they join the milk with dignity program who knows but right
[2:30:51.400 --> 2:30:54.960]  now migrants are protesting at the Ben and Jerry's headquarters to ensure they get their
[2:30:54.960 --> 2:30:59.440]  freebies we don't know the outcome but one thing I sure do love is this liberal hypocrisy
[2:30:59.440 --> 2:31:03.600]  Rob Dew reporting for info wars dot com and info wars nightly news it's not just our water
[2:31:03.600 --> 2:31:07.760]  we need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned it's the air we're breathing

[2:34:50.240 --> 2:34:56.040]  megan kelly had no appeal to me was super boring it was work i had to do because my
[2:34:56.040 --> 2:35:04.240]  gut told me to do it i felt nasty when i got home that night because it was just such a
[2:35:04.240 --> 2:35:14.000]  joke to interface with the old rotting facade of globalism but look how far these arrogant
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:23.120]  pieces of garbage have slid back in connie chung's day 20 years ago in her heyday she
[2:35:23.120 --> 2:35:30.280]  had on average 20 million viewers every night now the nightly news has five on the major
[2:35:30.280 --> 2:35:35.560]  networks and what happened to megan kelly for two weeks the biggest item in the new
[2:35:35.560 --> 2:35:40.920]  cycle bigger than coming bigger than russia gate bigger than at all it was alex jones
[2:35:40.920 --> 2:35:46.400]  megan kelly and they use it as a way to demonize me and attack me but nsm is so discredited
[2:35:46.400 --> 2:35:52.200]  all it did was make giant crowds of people actually come and tune in and now suddenly
[2:35:52.200 --> 2:35:58.200]  groups that didn't even like me are liking us and we're in our audience is just swelling
[2:35:58.200 --> 2:36:05.200]  we've never had listeners like this at this time during the summer this is like a november

[2:38:00.080 --> 2:38:08.280]  late and come back on his show all right i want to go back to your phone calls but since
[2:38:08.280 --> 2:38:13.600]  we talked about it here is the connie chung interview from the mid nineteen nineties that
[2:38:13.600 --> 2:38:18.600]  led to her being fired and her ratings collapsing because she would lie to an old lady here
[2:38:18.600 --> 2:38:26.280]  it is this is game rich what is what has new told you about president clinton nothing
[2:38:26.280 --> 2:38:32.480]  and i can't tell you what he said about hillary you can't i can't why don't you just whisper
[2:38:32.480 --> 2:38:50.160]  it to me just between you and me oh man i'll tell you about newton riche he's super smart
[2:38:50.160 --> 2:38:56.480]  ultra smart he knows everything i know before i was born he worked for nelson rockfeller
[2:38:56.480 --> 2:39:01.040]  and was led on the whole show he's professor he's a futurist and he's written forwards to
[2:39:01.040 --> 2:39:07.400]  books calling for world government and and and world microchips he is a technocrat so
[2:39:07.400 --> 2:39:13.520]  i don't trust him but when he argues for our side there's none better i mean the guy is
[2:39:13.520 --> 2:39:21.040]  smart as they come and that's why he works for the rockfellers but lately he's actually
[2:39:21.040 --> 2:39:26.320]  been fighting to cut the taxes and secure the border and kill tpp and kill imf and kill
[2:39:26.320 --> 2:39:31.720]  world bank and kill globalism so i guess he might have just figured out which side's about
[2:39:31.720 --> 2:39:36.880]  to win maybe because i've been on the phone with well-known folks that have been part
[2:39:36.880 --> 2:39:42.120]  of builder bird and part of other big international organizations and they say look the tides out
[2:39:42.120 --> 2:39:46.040]  not peter teal he said that too i've talked to him but but they said the same thing the
[2:39:46.040 --> 2:39:49.960]  tides out globalism was supposed to have a free market for everybody it's not it's crony
[2:39:49.960 --> 2:39:53.520]  capitalism it didn't deliver just like the liberal joseph sticklets who won two noble
[2:39:53.520 --> 2:39:57.480]  prizes set on the show you know liberalism has become a fraud conservatives has become
[2:39:57.480 --> 2:40:01.560]  a fraud the elite want to make people poor to control them this is not real liberalism
[2:40:01.560 --> 2:40:06.360]  we got to stop this so there's different schools of thought there's fake liberals there's fake
[2:40:06.360 --> 2:40:09.880]  conservatives then there's real liberals and there's real conservatives and i've talked
[2:40:09.880 --> 2:40:16.280]  to real liberals and i've talked to real conservatives and you know you've heard john you've heard
[2:40:16.280 --> 2:40:21.320]  robert david steel on the show that's his name right the former cia guy i'm teleprompter
[2:40:21.320 --> 2:40:26.160]  free we should get him back on talk about his meetings with roth childs and people high
[2:40:26.160 --> 2:40:30.880]  level that are like no no they don't want to get rid everybody and they want to not
[2:40:30.880 --> 2:40:34.520]  go to islam and they want to go ahead and secure things and they agree they don't want
[2:40:34.520 --> 2:40:37.240]  world government and think it's a bad idea but then they've got the other side of their
[2:40:37.240 --> 2:40:42.960]  family that wants it so you know the truth is people are complex and now that globalism
[2:40:42.960 --> 2:40:49.120]  has gotten so close and is here and people really realize this is what hitler wishes
[2:40:49.120 --> 2:40:58.200]  he was a lot of people are going you know what we might not want to actually do this
[2:40:58.200 --> 2:41:03.480]  ally with radical islam they're telling feminist women put a jibs on all these women are going
[2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:09.200]  on what the i thought feminisms where i'm in charge and i take over and the men are
[2:41:09.200 --> 2:41:13.840]  like a subclass because high level feminists know that it's about power and domination
[2:41:13.840 --> 2:41:17.800]  and taking control of the species it's not about empowering women or men it's about being
[2:41:17.800 --> 2:41:22.840]  authoritarians under the name of women because men are so demoralized dumbed down and uneducated
[2:41:22.840 --> 2:41:29.880]  and falling apart right now but but even the authoritarian women are like going to bring
[2:41:29.880 --> 2:41:34.040]  in the muslims and have them run stuff and i don't think so i don't think so no we're
[2:41:34.040 --> 2:41:38.560]  not doing that and that's how crazy this is how crazy are your people that want to go
[2:41:38.560 --> 2:41:45.320]  along with the new world order all you liberals all you and the litmus test get crazier and
[2:41:45.320 --> 2:41:50.040]  crazier and crazier what you've got to accept what you've got to go along with what you've
[2:41:50.040 --> 2:41:56.400]  got to push till we have the huffington post and comedy central and i've got all these

[2:44:06.200 --> 2:44:11.120]  psychotic killers on earth and so after we're done with this just type in north korea labor
[2:44:11.120 --> 2:44:15.720]  camps and then click on the images of the torture and the death and the murder will
[2:44:15.720 --> 2:44:21.440]  put it on screen for you where they admittedly hang people by their legs rape women kill

[2:44:46.960 --> 2:44:50.880]  of those that have escaped but this has been confirmed there are some photos and things
[2:44:50.880 --> 2:44:56.160]  that the north koreans have put out themselves and you are worked to death but if somebody
[2:44:56.160 --> 2:45:00.120]  does something wrong in your family like make a joke about the dear leader they always need
[2:45:00.120 --> 2:45:05.160]  new people for it they bring you there with your wife and children then they rape them
[2:45:05.160 --> 2:45:10.840]  and kill them in front of you then they work you to death and they feed on the pain in

[2:45:15.280 --> 2:45:21.500]  show the full palette of images there's this particular shot of a of a female guard looking
[2:45:21.500 --> 2:45:26.000]  down from the corner of her eye through the fence at someone taking a photo and you look
[2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:31.840]  at the power trip at the evil at a person drunk on torturing people she may be near
[2:45:31.840 --> 2:45:38.680]  starving to death herself but she has that same satanic look of enjoyment there it is
[2:45:38.680 --> 2:45:42.800]  now let's cut to a trendy in the lap of luxury and one of the most wealthy countries in the
[2:45:42.800 --> 2:45:48.200]  world where our poor live like kings and then they're going to make fun of somebody just

[2:46:05.400 --> 2:46:10.840]  your mouth about while the majority of the victims of north korea are asians and their
[2:46:10.840 --> 2:46:15.400]  own people murdered by the tens of millions by the most degenerate scum on earth that
[2:46:15.400 --> 2:46:20.480]  leftist make jokes about and that leftist travel there to make jokes about and that

[2:57:34.160 --> 2:57:37.800]  are tripping because they're all satanic and they're all in different cultures seems like
[2:57:37.800 --> 2:57:42.760]  this like this weird Harry Potter alternate universe is going on like there's like a good
[2:57:42.760 --> 2:57:47.160]  Illuminati and a bad Illuminati and they all are both aware of each other but like a smuggle
[2:57:47.160 --> 2:57:52.160]  kind of like aren't supposed to know what's going on behind the scenes and I know a lot
[2:57:52.160 --> 2:57:58.280]  of these Luciferians have this trio that they have to tell us what they're doing so I think
[2:57:58.280 --> 2:58:01.840]  that's right metaphysically the vampire has to ask permission to come in I'm gonna hold
[2:58:01.840 --> 2:58:05.320]  you over because what you're saying so important stay right there I'm gonna come right back

[2:58:14.560 --> 2:58:19.880]  folks what she just said is everything there's all these different delusions of grandeur and
[2:58:19.880 --> 2:58:24.200]  that's what evil is is like mental illness it's systems of thought that make you artificially
[2:58:24.200 --> 2:58:28.400]  mentally ill and that lower your spiritual defenses and more and more I realize as we
[2:58:28.400 --> 2:58:32.680]  see mental illness and insanity and people breaking down intensifying around us which
[2:58:32.680 --> 2:58:37.200]  they admit is happening it's because this world's alive and people have bought into
[2:58:37.200 --> 2:58:42.000]  it they're going crazy and a lot of people like agent Smith are just becoming possessed
[2:58:42.000 --> 2:58:46.920]  by the spirit of this world and that's it they serve the system they believe they're
[2:58:46.920 --> 2:58:50.840]  part of it they see their system that's cancer and trouble so they're trying to overthrow

[3:00:46.440 --> 3:00:50.920]  weird harry potter alternate universe is going on that you know the the good faction knows
[3:00:50.920 --> 3:00:55.320]  about the bad faction they can't bust each other out they can't tell us what's really
[3:00:55.320 --> 3:01:01.080]  going on but they're behind the scenes trying to do what they can to you know secure america's
[3:01:01.080 --> 3:01:04.600]  freedom secure the world freedom you know because they say tan and cult has been around
[3:01:04.600 --> 3:01:10.720]  for for an ancient and ancient times you know it's been around i mean even pre flood they're
[3:01:10.720 --> 3:01:16.040]  saying now pre flood who knows this virus has been around for a very very long time and
[3:01:16.040 --> 3:01:20.800]  what's going on is that you're you're hearing and feeling that the dying throws of an animal
[3:01:20.800 --> 3:01:25.160]  that's that's just like gasping for its last breath and i bet you this dude was the guy
[3:01:25.160 --> 3:01:29.840]  that the shooter that shot scolese you probably was a pio i'm not trying to i'm not trying
[3:01:29.840 --> 3:01:34.120]  to like put put anything out there but um you know all these guys well he sure looked
[3:01:34.120 --> 3:01:42.720]  like one he sure looked like he sure looked like a denise hasher clone uh keep going
[3:01:42.720 --> 3:01:49.160]  about you know and and it just seems like all these people have the same um i've been
[3:01:49.160 --> 3:01:54.160]  in abusive relationships i've had abusive um situations in my life and all these people
[3:01:54.160 --> 3:01:58.600]  have the same the same trauma you know and what they want to push that trauma on to the
[3:01:58.600 --> 3:02:03.400]  general public because they have to tell their luciferian coders they have to tell us what
[3:02:03.400 --> 3:02:08.560]  they're doing to us and so that's what they're doing and and we have to pay attention to
[3:02:08.560 --> 3:02:12.720]  the uh the the videos that they that they push how we have to pay attention to the publishing
[3:02:12.720 --> 3:02:19.760]  companies we have to push and put up pay attention to the um the newspapers the people that are
[3:02:19.760 --> 3:02:23.160]  funding these people what they're you're absolutely right you know you know it's not that i'm
[3:02:23.160 --> 3:02:27.320]  mr goody two shoes and perfect myself but when it comes to these types of like denise
[3:02:27.320 --> 3:02:31.040]  hasher and it looks like this clone of him and now that you make the point that uh you
[3:02:31.040 --> 3:02:36.680]  know when attacked uh this this disbarney sanders supporter it really is a spiritual
[3:02:36.680 --> 3:02:40.560]  thing and and i know people that want to destroy things and overthrow things and screw things
[3:02:40.560 --> 3:02:45.760]  up because that's their nature and if you let them in they do it they can't help it
[3:02:45.760 --> 3:02:52.400]  they get thrilled by doing bad by being dishonorable and it seems like there's so much dishonor
[3:02:52.400 --> 3:02:58.040]  and so much betrayal people would rather betray someone than even be successful it's very
[3:02:58.040 --> 3:03:05.720]  yeah they they you know michael totharin did say um uh he said you know it's it's the duty
[3:03:05.720 --> 3:03:10.520]  of the uh the vacuum cleaner salesman to come and knock at your door and sell you a piece
[3:03:10.520 --> 3:03:15.560]  of garbage now whether or not you open up the door and you let the guy in that's entirely
[3:03:15.560 --> 3:03:19.640]  up to you and what they have to do is they have to morally corrupt us they have to corrupt
[3:03:19.640 --> 3:03:23.320]  us from the very beginning because then if we're corrupted from the very beginning then
[3:03:23.320 --> 3:03:28.320]  what won't we do as we turn 10 or as we turn 15 or as we go through these milestones in
[3:03:28.320 --> 3:03:32.400]  our life what won't we do what boundaries and that's it exactly and then they tell us
[3:03:32.400 --> 3:03:37.360]  that we're stopping free will know they're trying to grab kids and political brainwash
[3:03:37.360 --> 3:03:42.240]  and sexually brainwash them early to control their destiny and screw them up so they never
[3:03:42.240 --> 3:03:47.040]  develop into be the powerful sentient beings they would have been this is totally satanic
[3:03:47.040 --> 3:03:50.520]  and their whole religion is about hurting children and you can call them what you want
[3:03:50.520 --> 3:03:55.880]  but they are literally scum they're weak they're twisted they're ugly they're hateful that's
[3:03:55.880 --> 3:04:01.640]  why they sow deceit it's why they sow war it's why they sow hatred uh and they're total
[3:04:01.640 --> 3:04:07.240]  enemies of humanity all of them all of them Rachel Maddow uh Hillary Clinton uh Barack
[3:04:07.240 --> 3:04:14.000]  Obama all of them are just ravenous hateful uh creatures that want to screw up society
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:17.960]  as much as possible you got the republican leadership just as bad or worse they are the
[3:04:17.960 --> 3:04:22.680]  literal scum of the earth like Dennis Hastert procuring children for congress for decades
[3:04:22.680 --> 3:04:26.440]  before they made him a congressman and they made him a speaker of the house because he
[3:04:26.440 --> 3:04:31.640]  was a big fat pedophile and part of their pedophile cult uh god bless his sentient
[3:04:31.640 --> 3:04:38.480]  great points but it comes down to the globalist love killing children they love enslaving
[3:04:38.480 --> 3:04:43.600]  women they love death they love radical Islam because it kills children it has sex slavery
[3:04:43.600 --> 3:04:49.120]  it legalizes pedophilia i'm sorry that's who they are and they are just ravenous scum
[3:04:49.120 --> 3:04:53.480]  that thought they had full control and were about to have a big political purge of christians
[3:04:53.480 --> 3:04:57.520]  in america and they got thrown back on their face so now they're trying to reorganize and
[3:04:57.520 --> 3:05:03.480]  poison and destroy as fast as they can we'll be back with paul watchen it looks like the
[3:05:03.480 --> 3:05:08.360]  summer of rage has claimed another victim report on info wars dot com Armenian gang

[3:05:59.040 --> 3:06:07.640]  dot com and info wars nightly news thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry
[3:06:07.640 --> 3:06:13.760]  our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize
[3:06:13.760 --> 3:06:20.960]  and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs
[3:06:20.960 --> 3:06:26.760]  they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent
[3:06:26.760 --> 3:06:32.600]  weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water and the lining of plastics that
[3:06:32.600 --> 3:06:38.280]  destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death i

[3:06:53.360 --> 3:06:57.960]  why antroplex has turned so many heads today it's time for us to take our bodies back into
[3:06:57.960 --> 3:07:03.280]  our own hands and it starts at info wars life dot com with antroplex mrix essentials that's
[3:07:03.280 --> 3:07:10.040]  my middle name i've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand

[3:08:06.360 --> 3:08:14.800]  the information war it's alex jones well paul watson they talked about maybe having to leave
[3:08:14.800 --> 3:08:19.520]  the uk soon to the united states or some other place because they're trying to send the police
[3:08:19.520 --> 3:08:24.480]  after and they're saying arrest him for criticizing orthodox islam murdering people we've seen
[3:08:24.480 --> 3:08:31.520]  more stabbings in england more car attacks more attacks today in paris france now i see
[3:08:31.520 --> 3:08:36.000]  paul in news articles they're saying maybe it's paul watson's fault that guy a few days
[3:08:36.000 --> 3:08:40.600]  ago ran his car into somebody who was supposedly a right winger paul was the first person to
[3:08:40.600 --> 3:08:46.800]  cry it and previously say we don't want violence but the left saying whites are to blame mainly
[3:08:46.800 --> 3:08:50.120]  white people are saying that and that and that and that christians are to blame and
[3:08:50.120 --> 3:08:55.840]  that we have to have a rampaging war but when muslims blow up 27 little girls at the ariana
[3:08:55.840 --> 3:09:00.560]  ariana grande concert well then it's okay you know because we need to all just come together
[3:09:00.560 --> 3:09:06.640]  and submit to islam and now the prime minister of england has come out and said we must battle
[3:09:06.640 --> 3:09:11.840]  islamophobia and has gotten all hysterical uh over this one person that supposedly got
[3:09:11.840 --> 3:09:15.400]  run over the whole thing sounds staged to me because you've got them saying a man's
[3:09:15.400 --> 3:09:20.840]  already sick on the ground with a crowd all around him and then a truck hits that and
[3:09:20.840 --> 3:09:25.240]  then that's the man that dies i mean we know they admittedly put the little dead baby there
[3:09:25.240 --> 3:09:31.040]  on the beach for the photos of it with a photo i'm if you remember that to pull heart strings
[3:09:31.040 --> 3:09:35.280]  i'm not saying the baby didn't die actually crossing or that europe didn't kill the baby
[3:09:35.280 --> 3:09:39.160]  advertising come to europe everything's for free so their parents you know threw the baby
[3:09:39.160 --> 3:09:43.160]  into a boat sitting out into the mediterranean but the point is these folks are famous for
[3:09:43.160 --> 3:09:48.120]  staging things so paul i guess you got no friends because people read the papers they
[3:09:48.120 --> 3:09:53.280]  can't be seen with you but you know in an age of media mainstream media being so discredited
[3:09:53.280 --> 3:09:59.040]  that's the great badge of honor i mean look at megan kelly the lowest ratings ever recorded
[3:09:59.040 --> 3:10:06.520]  for dateline nbc 3.5 million and it gets worse paul it gets worse paul the worst ratings
[3:10:06.520 --> 3:10:13.280]  of the day on broadcast tv people firmly rejecting the most hyped up tv show of two weeks now
[3:10:13.280 --> 3:10:17.280]  some would say it's a rejection of pumpkin head or the wet walrus as i'm known in the
[3:10:17.280 --> 3:10:23.160]  piece no we had 20 plus million views on our videos that week about it we had record traffic
[3:10:23.160 --> 3:10:28.320]  that we've ever had in the month of june basically double it there are even news articles showing
[3:10:28.320 --> 3:10:33.800]  we had double the traffic so we got record listeners 20 plus million extra views totally
[3:10:33.800 --> 3:10:39.560]  viral thousands and thousands of news articles a day about us and she got nothing except the
[3:10:39.560 --> 3:10:46.040]  tape showing she lied to me paul watson no it's incredibly hilarious alex to see the
[3:10:46.040 --> 3:10:51.120]  whining and the butthurt and the mainstream media today you've got jim acosta of cnn of
[3:10:51.120 --> 3:10:55.840]  course he's had several stats with trump you remember the one where trump called cnn fake
[3:10:55.840 --> 3:11:02.520]  news that was jim acosta this is an activist posing as a neutral journalist he's out again
[3:11:02.520 --> 3:11:08.080]  on television whining and i'm going to do an article about it he basically said oh this
[3:11:08.080 --> 3:11:12.840]  is the new normal trump gets one question from the mainstream media and another from
[3:11:12.840 --> 3:11:18.280]  a conservative outlet how terrible is that this is the new normal he's literally having
[3:11:18.280 --> 3:11:22.400]  a temper attack but isn't he the guy that got caught lying saying trump didn't visit
[3:11:22.400 --> 3:11:26.640]  the shock congressman last week yeah same guy i mean doesn't he get caught like every
[3:11:26.640 --> 3:11:33.880]  time lying he's an activist posing as an impartial journalist and every time he goes on tv and
[3:11:33.880 --> 3:11:39.000]  whines about it god forbid trump should take an equal amount of questions from so-called
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:43.920]  friendly media outlets as the ones that absolutely hate him and want to destroy him on a daily
[3:11:43.920 --> 3:11:49.080]  basis god forbid he should have some kind of balance that's the new normal that's terrible
[3:11:49.080 --> 3:11:54.120]  he gets up and whines about it on cnn and again that was the same guy who lied and said that
[3:11:54.120 --> 3:11:59.880]  trump didn't visit scolese failed to retract it blamed it on some other reporter when he
[3:11:59.880 --> 3:12:06.240]  originally claimed it was from a white house source complete liar complete phony fake news
[3:12:06.240 --> 3:12:11.840]  upon tv again whining about trump he's an activist he's not a journalist i want to take
[3:12:11.840 --> 3:12:16.400]  a few calls and let you take over you're also going to be hosting fourth hour tomorrow paul
[3:12:16.400 --> 3:12:22.480]  who's a bigger liar who's the biggest in european u.s or australian in western media who is
[3:12:22.480 --> 3:12:29.800]  the biggest liar of them all brian williams tony chung uh megan kelly uh or is yet katie
[3:12:29.800 --> 3:12:36.320]  kurrick famously edited gun owners to make them sound like morons they lie on an industrial
[3:12:36.320 --> 3:12:40.760]  scale i mean our lives we don't even lie i mean we could we could get something wrong
[3:12:40.760 --> 3:12:44.920]  i mean i write like 900 articles a year yeah occasionally i'm going to get something wrong
[3:12:44.920 --> 3:12:48.720]  and they celebrate the two or three you got wrong they have whole articles about here is
[3:12:48.720 --> 3:12:55.040]  our paul's full of crap going back to 2004 or whatever so the definition of fake news
[3:12:55.040 --> 3:12:59.680]  is deliberately lying knowing that you're lying that's the very definition of the mainstream
[3:12:59.680 --> 3:13:06.920]  media you know quoting curveball drunken known disinfo outlets for the iraqi wmd propaganda
[3:13:06.920 --> 3:13:13.160]  differences their their lies their mistakes are mechanized in industrial they start wars
[3:13:13.160 --> 3:13:17.480]  that lead to deaths of millions of people so for those kind of individuals to lecture
[3:13:17.480 --> 3:13:22.920]  us about fake news is pretty rich isn't it oh and by the way alex before you get to those
[3:13:22.920 --> 3:13:28.120]  callers news study you probably covered this earlier but remember they bashed trump over
[3:13:28.120 --> 3:13:33.640]  and over again oh he cited an info war story saying that three million illegals may have
[3:13:33.640 --> 3:13:40.080]  voted how debunked how discredited that's all being proven now yeah we underestimated
[3:13:40.080 --> 3:13:48.040]  it 5.7 million of them voted in 2008 so who knows what it was in 2016 hillary won the
[3:13:48.040 --> 3:13:53.200]  popular vote by about 2.8 million so you take that away trump was well that just broke we
[3:13:53.200 --> 3:13:59.400]  got to get this on drudge i mean we were going on for pure research fox business associated
[3:13:59.400 --> 3:14:04.720]  press uh george washington mason university i mean i'm going from memory here there were
[3:14:04.720 --> 3:14:10.760]  like 50 studies shang between two and four million were confirmed to have voted who were
[3:14:10.760 --> 3:14:17.320]  dead off the rolls then there was something like 3.2 million illegals that were on the
[3:14:17.320 --> 3:14:21.960]  rolls you added it all together was like nine million or something we went with some conservative
[3:14:21.960 --> 3:14:26.080]  number of three million and they said we were liars and as you said it's now come out it's
[3:14:26.080 --> 3:14:31.960]  much bigger yeah and the data was already out there it's just these bias organizations
[3:14:31.960 --> 3:14:38.440]  took it and then came out with a bizarre assertion that no illegals whatsoever voted in the election
[3:14:38.440 --> 3:14:44.360]  you had independent experts look at it and found that now it's anything up to 5.7 million
[3:14:44.360 --> 3:14:48.960]  of course you've got vice president pens doing an investigation of that right now so we're
[3:14:48.960 --> 3:14:53.800]  going to find out the exact number but according to this it looks like we underestimated it
[3:14:53.800 --> 3:14:57.840]  and let me find out what's let me break down for folks that the what's unfolded and take
[3:14:57.840 --> 3:15:01.280]  a few of these calls but this is what i mean to say i want to explain how this fake news
[3:15:01.280 --> 3:15:07.360]  stuff works they know they can't say pure research and the washington times and all these other
[3:15:07.360 --> 3:15:12.680]  groups are totally fake okay people know they've got pretty good track records so they demonize
[3:15:12.680 --> 3:15:18.920]  info wars they demonize trump they demonize bright bart and say we're fake knowing we're
[3:15:18.920 --> 3:15:23.560]  reporting on all the research papers they then say that we totally made it up so we've
[3:15:23.560 --> 3:15:29.720]  been chosen to be labeled as fake so that then when we report on everything as news agencies
[3:15:29.720 --> 3:15:35.080]  they can then report thousands of things are fake that aren't without getting sued by major
[3:15:35.080 --> 3:15:39.640]  newspapers that were actually quoting or pure research or gallup or whatever now let me
[3:15:39.640 --> 3:15:45.080]  expand the problem is they labeled us as fake that made their audience come to us to see
[3:15:45.080 --> 3:15:51.000]  if we were they like what they heard they kept listening here's an example may 3rd come
[3:15:51.000 --> 3:15:56.640]  he goes out and he tells congress no one in the administration tried to influence me or
[3:15:56.640 --> 3:16:02.280]  told me to obstruct justice we run it they say it's fake then he comes out june 8 says
[3:16:02.280 --> 3:16:06.560]  it again i can play the senator senator burr he says no they didn't try to obstruct justice
[3:16:06.560 --> 3:16:10.240]  trump never did that they then again said we were fake in the new york times the next
[3:16:10.240 --> 3:16:15.440]  day without even showing the video so that's all they've done is use us as the label to
[3:16:15.440 --> 3:16:22.200]  say reality's fake paul that is quite an honor no i mean there are numerous examples that
[3:16:22.200 --> 3:16:26.840]  there was a pedestrian email back in october last year the headline was wiki leaks email
[3:16:26.840 --> 3:16:31.480]  hillary campaign struggles to reach effing dumb young people and this was an exchange
[3:16:31.480 --> 3:16:38.880]  between a marketing executive and john pedestrian we reported that with the quotes direct from
[3:16:38.880 --> 3:16:44.920]  the released email the leaked email and snopes does an article and says oh the the marketing
[3:16:44.920 --> 3:16:50.080]  executive this plinton i didn't really mean that even though that's his direct quote in
[3:16:50.080 --> 3:16:55.080]  the email this is what he actually meant and they made up an entirely new quote literally
[3:16:55.080 --> 3:17:00.040]  fake news pulled it out of thin air and then said no he actually meant this he wasn't talking
[3:17:00.040 --> 3:17:05.520]  about effing dumb young people he meant something else we're gonna create a quote out of nothing
[3:17:05.520 --> 3:17:11.200]  and then call you fake news for using the original quote and that's the key calm how
[3:17:11.200 --> 3:17:15.440]  do we reach out to the to the young people the trendies who've been conned who've been
[3:17:15.440 --> 3:17:18.760]  manipulated who think they're on the winning team and are upset now because they have
[3:17:18.760 --> 3:17:24.040]  nothing nothing cultural nothing financial as they see what they believe is their stake
[3:17:24.040 --> 3:17:29.320]  the democratic combine of doddering senile Nancy Pelosi and everybody stumbling around
[3:17:29.320 --> 3:17:33.840]  in circles they see their zombie ship going under they're mad at us that we're getting
[3:17:33.840 --> 3:17:37.840]  off the ship we don't even want to fight with them how do you tell somebody they've been
[3:17:37.840 --> 3:17:42.840]  conned because remember that talk show us we won't say his name 15 years ago that flipped
[3:17:42.840 --> 3:17:46.480]  out because I told him the Nigeria email was fake and he wasn't really getting a million
[3:17:46.480 --> 3:17:51.000]  dollars he got ripped off for tens of thousands of dollars I've had family you've had people
[3:17:51.000 --> 3:17:55.400]  the same way they won't listen when they're being conned when they get ripped off they're
[3:17:55.400 --> 3:17:59.920]  still mad at us for life so it's the same thing with trendies how do we let them know
[3:17:59.920 --> 3:18:06.360]  we really care about them I think the main thing Alex is to tackle this idea that communism
[3:18:06.360 --> 3:18:11.440]  and socialism is the solution which we have to discredit every single generation because
[3:18:11.440 --> 3:18:15.760]  they've created this fake brand of populism through Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn here
[3:18:15.760 --> 3:18:21.160]  in the UK who looks like he could win the next election literally a Venezuelan fanboy
[3:18:21.160 --> 3:18:26.920]  Hamas Hezbollah IRA terrorist sympathizer so you have to discredit this fake left wing
[3:18:26.920 --> 3:18:31.720]  brand of populism that really does just concentrate wealth in the hands of the elite it's not
[3:18:31.720 --> 3:18:36.320]  even about redistribution of wealth but now we have literally the guy who's probably going
[3:18:36.320 --> 3:18:42.320]  to be the next prime minister calling for private property to be seized so homeless people
[3:18:42.320 --> 3:18:46.120]  can be housed of course it's all going to be seized for the state if it actually happens
[3:18:46.120 --> 3:18:50.600]  anyway and the EU's been doing that discredit that and the EU's been doing that for years
[3:18:50.600 --> 3:18:56.480]  now giving people's houses to the migrants this is a plan yeah they're they're trying
[3:18:56.480 --> 3:19:00.680]  to get well you've seen the videos out of Italy they go into an old guy's hotel little
[3:19:00.680 --> 3:19:06.280]  bed and breakfast he's literally crying he later collapses they just boss in all these
[3:19:06.280 --> 3:19:13.480]  African migrants and they take over his hotel by force absolutely incredible situation in
[3:19:13.480 --> 3:19:17.400]  Germany today you've got more people their homes are being raided because they said mean
[3:19:17.400 --> 3:19:22.680]  things about migrants on the internet you've got van drivers in Calais being killed they
[3:19:22.680 --> 3:19:28.160]  put logs on the motorways they drive into them they're killed the BBC describes it as
[3:19:28.160 --> 3:19:33.480]  a temporary barrier there's actually huge tree trunks that they put in the road so we're
[3:19:33.480 --> 3:19:39.760]  living in an age of complete deception we've got road warrior level collapse going on in
[3:19:39.760 --> 3:19:45.000]  Europe major highways shut down and when they're killing people in road warrior attacks dragging
[3:19:45.000 --> 3:19:52.040]  families out of vehicles raping women they call it temporary barrier as the Islamic militant
[3:19:52.040 --> 3:19:59.120]  police officer citizen chief help the local citizens or when Palestinians stab an Israeli
[3:19:59.120 --> 3:20:04.680]  police woman to death and then the troops shoot them the headline is Israelis killed
[3:20:04.680 --> 3:20:10.800]  three Palestinians exactly but it's world refugee day Alex I mean we're not going to
[3:20:10.800 --> 3:20:15.440]  talk about the hundreds of thousands of Christians who have been displaced and beheaded and forced
[3:20:15.440 --> 3:20:19.680]  to pay the jizy attacks no we're going to talk about these economic migrants who are
[3:20:19.680 --> 3:20:27.480]  coming in again to coming into Italy 2.65% of them are actually refugees the vast majority
[3:20:27.480 --> 3:20:32.200]  of them they're not even coming from Libya economic migrants they're causing huge problems
[3:20:32.200 --> 3:20:37.240]  now we've got people in Calais being killed we've got a story out of RT infidel should
[3:20:37.240 --> 3:20:43.000]  have droughts cut Italy arrest Iraqi refugee over ISIS support we've got more rapes happening
[3:20:43.000 --> 3:20:49.640]  in Europe a lot I've been over to Europe it is literally in Rome Islamists everywhere
[3:20:49.640 --> 3:20:55.160]  crapping on the side of the street and you're and it's just France is imploding their tourism
[3:20:55.160 --> 3:21:01.560]  down 80% what in the world is happening France has basically given up I mean they had another
[3:21:01.560 --> 3:21:06.240]  incident yesterday they tried to blow up a police officer with a bomb in a car of the
[3:21:06.240 --> 3:21:11.760]  Champs Elysees France has given up France has done they made their decision Alex they voted
[3:21:11.760 --> 3:21:16.480]  for more of this what was it 5% and by the way to be clear you lived in London and France
[3:21:16.480 --> 3:21:21.880]  part of the time you've now evacuated France oh yeah my family's totally out of France
[3:21:21.880 --> 3:21:26.800]  and we're not going back for good I mean there are still in London probably there are still
[3:21:26.800 --> 3:21:33.240]  decent areas where you can live but again it's all segregation multi let's be clear
[3:21:33.240 --> 3:21:37.800]  your family worked in the steel industry they took that they shipped it offshore your parents
[3:21:37.800 --> 3:21:42.320]  sold everything they had went around a big bed and breakfast in France but it's so hellish
[3:21:42.320 --> 3:21:45.640]  with the Islamists running around murdering everybody that you guys have now evacuated
[3:21:45.640 --> 3:21:53.320]  to another country exactly but it was out in the countryside but even going back I could
[3:21:53.320 --> 3:21:57.880]  see in the supermarket and this is in quite a remote area you could see the increase in
[3:21:57.880 --> 3:22:04.280]  hijabs again they're becoming more radicalized more repressive not less as they supposedly
[3:22:04.280 --> 3:22:09.240]  integrate into Western society which is not happening but now Tommy Robinson needs to
[3:22:09.240 --> 3:22:15.600]  be arrested I need to be arrested because one drunken idiot tried to kill some Muslims
[3:22:15.600 --> 3:22:19.640]  let's not talk about the mechanized industrial bloodshed that's carried out in the name of
[3:22:19.640 --> 3:22:25.520]  Islam Alex Donald Trump is being criticized for not condemning this attack yesterday in
[3:22:25.520 --> 3:22:30.560]  London on these Muslims if he had to condemn every terrorist attack that happened he would
[3:22:30.560 --> 3:22:38.920]  have had to condemn 145 terror attacks since Ramadan started just 25 days ago he'd be doing
[3:22:38.920 --> 3:22:44.480]  little else than condemning terror attacks point is they're all Islamic almost every
[3:22:44.480 --> 3:22:49.720]  single one of them so how dare you criticize Trump for not condemning terror attacks if
[3:22:49.720 --> 3:22:54.400]  he actually did that but this shows us where it's going when somebody effectively which
[3:22:54.400 --> 3:22:58.680]  I hope doesn't happen goes and mows down a bunch of authoritarian liberals it's gonna
[3:22:58.680 --> 3:23:02.280]  be all of our faults when somebody mows down a bunch of jihadi Muslims gonna be all of
[3:23:02.280 --> 3:23:05.880]  our faults we can see how they're getting the class of civilization ready let's take
[3:23:05.880 --> 3:23:09.320]  a few calls I gotta get out of here because I'm stealing Paul's time and it's hard to
[3:23:09.320 --> 3:23:14.680]  twist his arm to get him on air he's a busy busy guy James in Texas James you're on here
[3:23:14.680 --> 3:23:21.120]  go ahead hey Alex and Paul and crew y'all are all doing a great job I've been listening
[3:23:21.120 --> 3:23:27.320]  since 2005 all your products are awesome thank you and your contests are great I just want
[3:23:27.320 --> 3:23:32.120]  to let you know I called in and got live on cc span this morning you're an anthony carnival
[3:23:32.120 --> 3:23:38.080]  segment and I was able to get the tagline out CNN as ISIS info wars calm and so we're
[3:23:38.080 --> 3:23:43.080]  breaking through the the line mainstream media unfortunately when I go back to look at the
[3:23:43.080 --> 3:23:47.600]  clip online they have censored it so you can hear me be introduced in the first part of
[3:23:47.600 --> 3:23:51.680]  my comment and then the audio goes just cuts out completely so they're clearly that's why
[3:23:51.680 --> 3:23:56.560]  folks have to record it live because we don't blow up bridges and blow up families and rape
[3:23:56.560 --> 3:24:01.720]  kids like ISIS does and put that out we call into shows we get on air you then tape the
[3:24:01.720 --> 3:24:05.800]  info attack and then you put it out yourself that's how you get around them they don't

[3:24:54.360 --> 3:25:01.280]  thing I think we've lost this the consciousness of of this immigration thing if we go back
[3:25:01.280 --> 3:25:07.120]  to 2007 operation fast and furious we're now seeing the regurgitating effects of what
[3:25:07.120 --> 3:25:13.920]  happened us giving guns to the cartels drugs coming in Megan Kelly talking about how these
[3:25:13.920 --> 3:25:17.680]  aren't drugs floating across the water I mean we can watch this this stuff on national
[3:25:17.680 --> 3:25:22.840]  geographic it's it's in full effect I mean Chicago's a nightmare all these things are
[3:25:22.840 --> 3:25:29.360]  happening and now you want to bring more Muslims in and currently I live in Seattle as to date
[3:25:29.360 --> 3:25:36.120]  today 11,000 people just in Seattle are homeless Tacoma just south of Seattle has declared a
[3:25:36.120 --> 3:25:40.920]  national state of emergency because they have so many homeless people we physically cannot
[3:25:40.920 --> 3:25:44.720]  take care of our own you ought to see Austin Texas I mean they're just you can't hardly
[3:25:44.720 --> 3:25:49.760]  go downtown now it's like day of the dead or something so then to come full circle you
[3:25:49.760 --> 3:25:54.360]  have all these heroin addicts that I see constantly I drive for a living I see people
[3:25:54.360 --> 3:25:58.640]  shooting up in the streets all day long these drugs come from these cartels this influx
[3:25:58.640 --> 3:26:04.560]  of people opening these borders and welfare and all of it created this nightmare environment
[3:26:04.560 --> 3:26:11.320]  absolutely Paul Watson now is the thing about Alex is that they're now trying to lay into
[3:26:11.320 --> 3:26:17.080]  this Islamophobia narrative they had a Muslim teen that was tragically killed in Virginia
[3:26:17.080 --> 3:26:22.280]  on Sunday night the left came out numerous different outlets prominent people blamed
[3:26:22.280 --> 3:26:27.520]  it on Donald Trump of course and his supporters and his rhetoric turned out Alex today that
[3:26:27.520 --> 3:26:32.960]  it was an illegal immigrant from El Salvador who they've been trying to deport for years
[3:26:32.960 --> 3:26:39.360]  responsible for murdering this 17 year old Muslim American teen they blamed it on Donald
[3:26:39.360 --> 3:26:43.560]  Trump but absolutely no evidence and I've got the tweets of the people of course when
[3:26:43.560 --> 3:26:48.840]  I pointed this out this out to them they immediately deleted the tweets and blocked me but you
[3:26:48.840 --> 3:26:53.280]  know flip it over you've got actual hate crime you've got a guy as you reported earlier getting
[3:26:53.280 --> 3:26:58.760]  beat up by an Armenian gang the actual hate crime wave is against conservatives and they
[3:26:58.760 --> 3:27:04.960]  try and seize on anything even if it's completely unrelated to try and twist that Islamophobia
[3:27:04.960 --> 3:27:10.120]  narrative because they want these refugees coming in you know 98% of whom are Muslim
[3:27:10.120 --> 3:27:13.880]  even though Christians are the biggest persecutor group in the world that's right Paul well you're
[3:27:13.880 --> 3:27:17.360]  doing an amazing job and thank you for hosting two days this week I know you're a busy guy
[3:27:17.360 --> 3:27:21.400]  but everybody wants you on air more and I just get excited to be on and talk with you
[3:27:21.400 --> 3:27:25.400]  I love the great work you're doing we've got unlimited calls here on try to jam in one
[3:27:25.400 --> 3:27:31.640]  or two more but this is just getting crazier and crazier if we don't get serious about
[3:27:31.640 --> 3:27:37.200]  this so I think civilization is going to collapse Paul well I think we're in a cycle now and
[3:27:37.200 --> 3:27:42.040]  a lot of experts have said this Alex which is a pre-war cycle we are at the height of
[3:27:42.040 --> 3:27:46.360]  a collapse style scenario there's definitely going to be a lot more chaos a lot more blood
[3:27:46.360 --> 3:27:51.760]  shed unfortunately over the next few years and it could lead to war that's not some apocalyptic
[3:27:51.760 --> 3:27:56.720]  doomsday prediction that's what many experts are saying because humanity goes through these
[3:27:56.720 --> 3:28:02.600]  cycles of chaos of riots of civil unrest and it always ends to war and again I'm not a
[3:28:02.600 --> 3:28:07.480]  eugenicist I don't want to artificially bring this in and do this I've been trying to fight
[3:28:07.480 --> 3:28:11.000]  as a humanitarian that wants to treat people like I want to be treated but all these sniveling
[3:28:11.000 --> 3:28:15.200]  lazy people and all these other folks that think this is funny when the mass die off
[3:28:15.200 --> 3:28:19.680]  happens when the veneer of civilization peels off they're all deader than a hammer and they're
[3:28:19.680 --> 3:28:24.760]  all untrained unfocused lazy people who are trying to start fights with the competent
[3:28:24.760 --> 3:28:30.160]  producers of the world in some existential envy situation and it's going to be explosive
[3:28:30.160 --> 3:28:37.080]  Paul no I mean you watch those antifa weapons training videos they're hilarious because
[3:28:37.080 --> 3:28:40.040]  they don't know what they're doing I mean I wouldn't know what I was doing because I'm
[3:28:40.040 --> 3:28:44.680]  completely disarmed peasant living in a country where it's it's illegal to even own pepper
[3:28:44.680 --> 3:28:49.320]  spray you can't even have pepper spray in your house but in a moment you and your brother
[3:28:49.320 --> 3:28:53.000]  were shooting bulls out the first time you shot guns with me like 15 years ago the first
[3:28:53.000 --> 3:28:58.000]  time you visited you we just need I know you don't like 110 degrees like Texas but we need
[3:28:58.000 --> 3:29:02.680]  to get you here at least six months out of the year don't evacuate to some other European
[3:29:02.680 --> 3:29:09.600]  country evacuate to the wall wall west my friend I might have to eventually I like to put like
[3:29:09.600 --> 3:29:14.200]  you said those people who are pushing for violence they're not very good at it are they
[3:29:14.200 --> 3:29:19.360]  I mean it's very fortunate that there wasn't a massacre of republicans last week and it's
[3:29:19.360 --> 3:29:24.160]  primarily because the guy was such a terrible shooter because again they're not trained in
[3:29:24.160 --> 3:29:28.800]  this didn't he look like Dennis Haster yeah he looked like a complete fruit cake but they're
[3:29:28.800 --> 3:29:33.240]  still they're still blaming Trump today you have the guy on 60 minutes I forgot his name
[3:29:33.240 --> 3:29:40.040]  using the guy who interviewed Cernovich flaming Trump for the attempted massacre of republican
[3:29:40.040 --> 3:29:44.560]  lawmakers yeah it's his fault that people are killing folks all right Paul's we got
[3:29:44.560 --> 3:29:48.160]  a few other collars but I'm sorry to Travis and Maureen you guys are awesome Paul's got
[3:29:48.160 --> 3:29:51.280]  to take over though not only do tonight's seven I'll be back tomorrow with David Knight
[3:29:51.280 --> 3:29:58.520]  and others we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[3:30:21.280 --> 3:30:25.480]  your campaign well over the weekend scores of farm workers and activists marched on Ben
[3:30:25.480 --> 3:30:29.520]  and Jerry's why because the migrant farm workers don't like the way they are being treated by
[3:30:29.520 --> 3:30:33.600]  the farms that provide milk to Ben and Jerry's and these migrant farm workers many of whom
[3:30:33.600 --> 3:30:38.400]  are illegal started the milk with dignity program in 2014 with a Vermont group migrant
[3:30:38.400 --> 3:30:42.600]  justice to ensure farms provide migrant workers some of which are illegal fair wages working
[3:30:42.600 --> 3:30:47.120]  conditions and decent housing in 2015 Ben and Jerry's agreed to join the program but
[3:30:47.120 --> 3:30:50.800]  they're still stuck in negotiations so will they join the milk with dignity program who
[3:30:50.800 --> 3:30:54.480]  knows but right now migrants are protesting at the Ben and Jerry's headquarters to ensure
[3:30:54.480 --> 3:30:58.320]  they get their freebies we don't know the outcome but one thing I sure do love is this

[3:33:22.920 --> 3:33:27.160]  alex jones show with me paul joseph watson i'm gonna get back into the news now of course
[3:33:27.160 --> 3:33:32.720]  there was an attempted massacre of republican lawmakers last week in alexandria and you
[3:33:32.720 --> 3:33:36.840]  would think that that would cause bernie sanders because it was a bernie sanders voter who
[3:33:36.840 --> 3:33:43.480]  attempted to carry out that massacre to change his rhetoric to lower the tone to be more
[3:33:43.480 --> 3:33:49.920]  cautious about what he's encouraging his supporters to do well now that's not happening the american
[3:33:49.920 --> 3:33:56.880]  mirror reports bernie sanders urges supporters to act in unprecedented way to stop republicans
[3:33:56.880 --> 3:34:02.880]  imagine if a donald trump voter had gone out and shot or tried to massacre a bunch of democrats
[3:34:02.880 --> 3:34:07.960]  and then trump had come out a few days later and said we need to act in unprecedented ways
[3:34:07.960 --> 3:34:15.400]  to stop democrats there'd be absolute hysteria bernie sanders comes out and says it absolutely
[3:34:15.400 --> 3:34:19.800]  nothing apparently not learning any lessons from a neophyte or attacked by one of his
[3:34:19.800 --> 3:34:25.680]  supporters on republican congressmen and staffers bernie sanders is urging democrats to fight
[3:34:25.680 --> 3:34:31.520]  the gop by any means necessary during a facebook live q&a with fellow progressive crank elizabeth
[3:34:31.520 --> 3:34:37.360]  warren pocahontas on monday sanders told a supporter named mary that liberals need to
[3:34:37.360 --> 3:34:44.320]  take quote unprecedented action to stop republicans he said we got to stand up and fight back
[3:34:44.320 --> 3:34:48.640]  we've got to be involved in the political process in a way that we have never been before
[3:34:48.640 --> 3:34:54.000]  because what is happening now in washington is unprecedented so again you get you get
[3:34:54.000 --> 3:34:59.920]  crazy people who are on the fringes of society they hear him saying that they're prone to
[3:34:59.920 --> 3:35:04.800]  violence what do you think is going to happen not going to end well is it and it's the timing
[3:35:04.800 --> 3:35:11.520]  of it literally less than a week after one of his supporters tries to massacre republicans
[3:35:11.520 --> 3:35:18.720]  he's talking about fighting taking down republicans in unprecedented ways again if trump said that
[3:35:18.720 --> 3:35:24.720]  there would be hysteria bernie sanders says it nothing because again the left never disavows
[3:35:24.720 --> 3:35:31.200]  violent extremism it encourages it at every turn that's the difference nobody's denying that they're
[3:35:31.200 --> 3:35:36.880]  aren't right wing violent extremists the difference is we don't encourage them we don't embrace them
[3:35:36.880 --> 3:35:43.200]  after these attacks happen we had that big story up on info wars dot com which we talked about earlier
[3:35:43.200 --> 3:35:48.720]  Trump was right new study reveals up to five point seven million illegals voted in election
[3:35:49.280 --> 3:35:57.520]  that was the 2008 election given the level of hysteria aimed at um trump's border policies
[3:35:57.520 --> 3:36:01.760]  surrounding the context of that debate you'd probably imagine that there would have been more
[3:36:02.400 --> 3:36:09.200]  illegal voters in 2016 so this organization looked at the data basically found that the
[3:36:09.200 --> 3:36:15.040]  available data that was already out there proves that up to five point seven million illegals
[3:36:15.040 --> 3:36:22.960]  voted in 2008 around three point six million as an upper figure in 2012 and again hillary clinton
[3:36:22.960 --> 3:36:28.240]  won the popular vote by about two point eight million donald trump came out on many occasions and
[3:36:28.240 --> 3:36:36.080]  said three million three million illegals probably voted vote fraud he got absolutely bashed from
[3:36:36.080 --> 3:36:41.760]  pillar to post and it was the discredited debunked info wars that was the source of that claim
[3:36:41.760 --> 3:36:47.680]  well now they've analyzed the actual data that's been available we underestimated the number if
[3:36:47.680 --> 3:36:53.040]  anything that's the story that's not going to get any play and the mainstream media will continue
[3:36:53.040 --> 3:36:57.600]  to say that trumps engaging in fake needs and conspiracy theories and he's actually pointing
[3:36:57.600 --> 3:37:05.680]  out the genuine possibility based on data that millions of illegal immigrants did vote more
[3:37:05.680 --> 3:37:10.320]  left-wing terrorism trump supporter stabbed nine times in parking lot you probably heard that story
[3:37:10.320 --> 3:37:16.080]  reported earlier just a week after republican politicians were attacked by bernie supporting
[3:37:16.080 --> 3:37:20.480]  leftists while practicing for the congressional ballgame baseball game a trump supporter has
[3:37:20.480 --> 3:37:26.160]  been stabbed nine times in a parking lot after left-wing thugs identified him as a conservative
[3:37:26.880 --> 3:37:34.240]  so we have yet another hate crime targeting a donald trump supporter it will get zero play
[3:37:34.240 --> 3:37:40.960]  in the mainstream media oh but a teen a teen american muslim gets murdered within hours
[3:37:40.960 --> 3:37:46.640]  they are out there blaming donald trump and his rhetoric despite there being no evidence whatsoever
[3:37:46.640 --> 3:37:52.640]  that it had anything to do with donald trump in fact the murder was carried out by an illegal
[3:37:52.640 --> 3:37:59.680]  alien from el Salvador who ice has been trying to deport for years oh and they suddenly lost all
[3:37:59.680 --> 3:38:05.680]  interest in the story i wonder why that is murder of muslim girl blamed on trump was
[3:38:05.680 --> 3:38:10.160]  committed by an illegal immigrant the murder of an american muslim teen in virginia that
[3:38:10.160 --> 3:38:14.560]  leftist blamed on donald trump was actually committed by an illegal immigrant as soon as
[3:38:14.560 --> 3:38:19.680]  this facet of the story became known leftists suddenly lost all interested all interest in the
[3:38:19.680 --> 3:38:27.760]  case i wonder why so you had a group of muslim teenagers the victim was called nabra hasanen
[3:38:27.760 --> 3:38:33.440]  who had gone to an old dollar's area muslim society function they were walking back home
[3:38:34.480 --> 3:38:41.520]  when suddenly darwin martinez torrez sounds like a white guy's name doesn't it drove up a
[3:38:41.520 --> 3:38:47.520]  curb towards a group of about 15 teens who were walking in fairfax county so he starts an argument
[3:38:47.520 --> 3:38:53.600]  with one of these teens then starts chasing the group with a baseball bat eventually catches up
[3:38:53.600 --> 3:38:59.120]  with this 17 year old american muslim girl whacks her around the head with the bat kills her takes
[3:38:59.120 --> 3:39:06.000]  her body to another location she died from blunt force trauma to the upper body now that came out
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:12.960]  sunday within days in fact it was the next day it was monday before we even knew the identity of
[3:39:12.960 --> 3:39:20.880]  the perpetrator the president and co-founder of the new agenda amy siskine tweeted this quote it
[3:39:20.880 --> 3:39:26.400]  appears at donald trump at real donald trump is also going to turn a blind eye to a white man
[3:39:26.400 --> 3:39:32.640]  kidnapping and murdering a 17 year old muslim woman in our country she continued trump's hatred
[3:39:32.640 --> 3:39:38.800]  and bigotry are ripping the fabric back country apart so she not only blamed trump she collectively
[3:39:38.800 --> 3:39:43.360]  demonized white people because that's perfectly acceptable to do that you do that to any other
[3:39:43.360 --> 3:39:48.800]  race or ethnicity or religion you're a bigot you're a racist but you can do it to white people that's
[3:39:48.800 --> 3:39:55.520]  fine before they even knew the identity of the perpetrator turns out that it's an illegal alien
[3:39:55.520 --> 3:40:02.400]  from el salvador as soon as that came out they suddenly lost interest in the story isn't that
[3:40:02.400 --> 3:40:09.120]  a shock the independent newspaper which of course is a left-wing newspaper in the united kingdom
[3:40:10.160 --> 3:40:16.160]  criticized trump for failing to address quote the murder of a muslim teenager in virginia
[3:40:16.160 --> 3:40:22.800]  the atlantic another left-wing publication came out and said muslims feel under siege that was the
[3:40:22.800 --> 3:40:29.600]  title of the article in which writer emma green tied hassan ends murder into a larger sinister
[3:40:29.600 --> 3:40:35.760]  narrative alleging a wave of islamophobia sweeping the west but one this wasn't islamophobia it was
[3:40:35.760 --> 3:40:41.120]  an insane crazy guy who just wanted to attack a bunch of people by the looks of it number two
[3:40:41.120 --> 3:40:46.960]  it had nothing to do with donald trump the guy wasn't white he was an illegal alien when this
[3:40:46.960 --> 3:40:53.280]  was pointed out to these three individuals who i just mentioned siskind the independent writer
[3:40:53.280 --> 3:40:59.600]  and the atlantic writer who i confronted on twitter about this this morning they had absolutely
[3:40:59.600 --> 3:41:06.320]  nothing to say in fact amy siskind within minutes of me pointing out that this was an illegal alien
[3:41:06.320 --> 3:41:10.240]  i basically said hey are you going to do another tweet about this are you going to update your
[3:41:10.240 --> 3:41:18.000]  story about this within minutes she deleted the tweet and she blocked me again no retraction
[3:41:18.000 --> 3:41:25.680]  for blaming it collectively demonizing white people demonizing trump no retraction whatsoever
[3:41:25.680 --> 3:41:30.880]  because that's just how they roll and it looks like this illegal immigrant who committed the
[3:41:30.880 --> 3:41:37.200]  murder was brought in under obama's unaccompanied alien children program but again they tried to
[3:41:37.200 --> 3:41:44.560]  spin it into a narrative about islamophobia which simply doesn't exist or their sporadic attacks
[3:41:44.560 --> 3:41:52.000]  on muslims yes nobody's denying that there isn't a nationwide epidemic of it like there is attacks
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:57.840]  on trump supporters which we see almost every day another one we reported on today
[3:42:00.320 --> 3:42:06.000]  now talking about leftist media hypocrisy flashback huff po said arrogant otto warn beer
[3:42:06.000 --> 3:42:11.360]  deserved to be imprisoned because he's white so you've probably seen the story by now the
[3:42:11.360 --> 3:42:18.080]  unfortunate death of this young guy who was imprisoned in north korea absolutely brutalized
[3:42:18.800 --> 3:42:23.600]  he managed to escape eventually he managed to get back to the us but of course died yesterday
[3:42:24.400 --> 3:42:28.640]  the huffington post when they originally wrote about this story basically said and it wasn't
[3:42:28.640 --> 3:42:34.000]  just the huffington post it was salon dot com it was larry wilmore they all viciously attacked
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:40.560]  otto warn beer because he was white making jokes about it said he basically deserved to be in a
[3:42:40.560 --> 3:42:48.400]  north korean gulag because he tried to steal what was it a flag from a hotel room do you have any
[3:42:48.400 --> 3:42:54.000]  idea the absolute terror that takes place in these north korean gulags they literally have
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:43:02.080]  pregnant women who give birth and the gods stamp the baby to death this is this is cyberian style
[3:43:02.080 --> 3:43:10.240]  tyranny absolute unremitting terror that this poor young guy had to go through they were making
[3:43:10.240 --> 3:43:18.480]  jokes about it and saying oh it's perfectly fine because he's white but he deserved it and now he's
[3:43:18.480 --> 3:43:24.240]  dead well how do you feel about that huffington post they actually started removing segments
[3:43:24.240 --> 3:43:31.120]  after this article where they made fun of this poor guy because he can't change the past larry
[3:43:31.120 --> 3:43:37.040]  wilmore the comedian relentlessly ripped into him again because he was white salon dot com and others
[3:43:37.040 --> 3:43:42.000]  but again how about just not being racist in the first place huffington post then you don't
[3:43:42.000 --> 3:43:48.560]  won't have to go back in memory hole all these inconvenient passages from your articles how about
[3:43:48.560 --> 3:43:55.120]  that absolutely incredible going back to what happened in london yesterday of course there's
[3:43:55.120 --> 3:44:02.480]  been an absolutely monumental freak out about that tidal wave of hysteria because there was a
[3:44:02.480 --> 3:44:08.400]  terror attack by a right-wing crazy guy most of them were quite pleased about that because it
[3:44:08.400 --> 3:44:13.920]  really fit into their narrative now they're saying that it's tommy robinson's fault that it's my fault
[3:44:13.920 --> 3:44:18.880]  that wear hate preachers you remember that meme that was put out to counter leftist which basically
[3:44:18.880 --> 3:44:24.640]  says everyone who disagrees with me is hitler because that's basically the only argument they
[3:44:24.640 --> 3:44:29.280]  have at this point that's been out for several months i think that should be changed to everyone
[3:44:29.280 --> 3:44:36.880]  who disagrees with me is a hate preacher because yes the same people who said absolutely nothing
[3:44:36.880 --> 3:44:43.680]  about actual hate preachers in the united kingdom who radicalized actual known terrorists in this
[3:44:43.680 --> 3:44:49.360]  country terrorists who try to carry out terrorist attacks they said nothing about that but as soon
[3:44:49.360 --> 3:44:56.240]  as this incident happened yesterday it was tommy robinson who had to be arrested because he called
[3:44:57.360 --> 3:45:03.040]  for example for the didsbury mosque to be investigated the mosque attended by the manchester
[3:45:03.040 --> 3:45:09.040]  bomber which passed out leaflets to hundreds of people that said basically the west is corrupt
[3:45:09.040 --> 3:45:14.960]  the rest the west is dead don't integrate reject the west no no we can't have an investigation
[3:45:14.960 --> 3:45:20.960]  into that we have to have an investigation into tommy robinson and his youtube videos news week
[3:45:21.680 --> 3:45:27.280]  is also more worried about my youtube videos than actual islamic terror attacks their headline is
[3:45:27.280 --> 3:45:33.520]  finsbury park attack how islamophobia spreads from the far right to the media they talk about
[3:45:33.520 --> 3:45:37.920]  shockingly the 10th most viewed video in the uk on the day of the west minster terrorist attack
[3:45:38.800 --> 3:45:44.320]  was by tommy robinson so they find the fact that tommy robinson put out a video
[3:45:44.320 --> 3:45:49.600]  on the day of the west minster terrorist attack shocking forget about the actual attack you
[3:45:49.600 --> 3:45:56.160]  know mowing down people in cold blood tearing them apart limb from limb stabbing police officers
[3:45:56.160 --> 3:46:01.120]  now that's not shocking what shocking is tommy robinson made a video about it oh my god what
[3:46:01.120 --> 3:46:06.240]  are we going to do the article continues again talking about the west minster terrorist attack
[3:46:06.240 --> 3:46:10.640]  which happened a few months ago similarly worrying is that in the aftermath of the attack
[3:46:10.640 --> 3:46:16.800]  this is what's worrying okay the most mentioned twitter account in britain was Paul Joseph Watson
[3:46:16.800 --> 3:46:21.520]  editor at large for the far right american conspiracy and fake news site info wars
[3:46:23.440 --> 3:46:27.840]  okay news week calling us fake news that's that's pretty rich isn't it given that they were
[3:46:27.840 --> 3:46:32.560]  vehemently behind the biggest fake news story of all time which led to the death of a million people
[3:46:32.560 --> 3:46:38.640]  but okay we'll drop that for now he launched his youtube channel in july 2011 and now has over
[3:46:38.640 --> 3:46:45.520]  950 000 subscribers yeah you better believe it just sense that but hurt right there because you
[3:46:45.520 --> 3:46:50.720]  don't translate on youtube do your news week you don't resonate with anyone on youtube because
[3:46:50.720 --> 3:46:57.040]  you're lazy your hacks have no talent whatsoever they don't know how to reach younger audiences
[3:46:57.040 --> 3:47:01.920]  because they're crap and you're jealous about it which is why you're going to implicate me
[3:47:01.920 --> 3:47:09.920]  in terror attacks shameful but again listen to what they're saying i've got over 950 000 subscribers
[3:47:10.800 --> 3:47:15.840]  my channel is being viewed over 206 million views on the videos with individual videos
[3:47:15.840 --> 3:47:20.080]  regularly being viewed over half a million times and some over several million times
[3:47:21.200 --> 3:47:29.280]  that's what they call worrying in the context of islamic terror attacks where little girls are
[3:47:29.280 --> 3:47:35.520]  having their arms and legs blown off where people having to jump into the river Thames
[3:47:36.160 --> 3:47:42.240]  because some jihadist is barreling towards them in a massive van at 80 miles an hour
[3:47:42.240 --> 3:47:48.160]  oh that no that's not worrying no that's not worrying actual suicide bombers at orion at
[3:47:48.160 --> 3:47:55.120]  grunde pop concert no that's not worrying what's worrying is that i've got nearly a million youtube
[3:47:55.120 --> 3:48:01.120]  subscribers that's what we should be concerned about people have viewed my videos 206 million
[3:48:01.120 --> 3:48:07.120]  times that's of concern the most mentioned twitter account of the day of the west minster attack
[3:48:07.120 --> 3:48:11.600]  was mine that's what we should be worried about not the fact that these attacks are happening
[3:48:11.600 --> 3:48:21.120]  in europe basically almost every day now no i've got nearly a million subscribers that's the main
[3:48:21.120 --> 3:48:27.280]  concern and that's why newsweek and mainstream media is a joke that's why you don't have a million
[3:48:27.280 --> 3:48:32.000]  subscribers on youtube that's why nobody reads you that's why you're going out of business
[3:48:32.000 --> 3:48:42.000]  because that is plainly ludicrous to equate those two things newsweek unbelievable ap reports german
[3:48:42.000 --> 3:48:47.440]  police hold day of action against hate postings online 36 targeted basically they're raiding people's
[3:48:47.440 --> 3:48:53.040]  homes because they said mean things on the internet about migrants it's happening yet again last
[3:48:53.040 --> 3:48:58.000]  remaining police station in migrant dominated swedish suburbs forced to close that's an rt report
[3:48:58.960 --> 3:49:05.120]  so the post nord came out and said it was basically unsafe to deliver mail there in other areas
[3:49:05.120 --> 3:49:10.880]  migrant areas of sweden they're building bulletproof police stations but it's all peaceful
[3:49:12.080 --> 3:49:15.600]  donald trump's wrong for talking about last night in sweden even though it was literally
[3:49:15.600 --> 3:49:23.760]  attacks every day crime stabbing shootings cars being set on fire oh and this is a good one the bbc
[3:49:23.760 --> 3:49:30.320]  described huge tree trunks being left in the road that killed a van driver in cali of course these
[3:49:30.320 --> 3:49:35.360]  migrants get out onto the highway they get huge tree trunks they leave them in the road to try and
[3:49:35.360 --> 3:49:40.880]  stop these these vans these lorries so they can hijack them to illegally sneak into the united
[3:49:40.880 --> 3:49:47.280]  kingdom they put a huge tree trunk several tree trunks on the road a van driver drove into them
[3:49:47.280 --> 3:49:53.920]  another van crashed into the back of him one of the van drivers died and how did the bbc report it
[3:49:54.880 --> 3:50:03.120]  that the migrants had just put in a quote makeshift barrier a makeshift barrier again notice how they
[3:50:03.120 --> 3:50:08.800]  tried to soften it every single time it was like three giant tree trunks let's just call it a makeshift
[3:50:08.800 --> 3:50:14.480]  barrier and then maybe you know people will have more sympathy for the migrants absolutely incredible
[3:50:15.200 --> 3:50:20.720]  but a van driver has died in an accident at cali wasn't really an accident was it it was a tent
[3:50:20.720 --> 3:50:25.840]  to murder after migrants drag tree trunks onto the a16 moto n a bit to slow traffic and break
[3:50:25.840 --> 3:50:32.080]  into vehicles bound for britain the only surprise about that story is it's the first time it's happened
[3:50:32.080 --> 3:50:39.840]  they supposedly demolished the cali migrant camp it's back in operation just in splinter different
[3:50:39.840 --> 3:50:46.080]  areas around the town of cali of course you have leftists working for NGOs who set up food stalls
[3:50:46.080 --> 3:50:51.680]  hand out food for these migrants encouraging them to come there from other parts of france
[3:50:52.240 --> 3:50:57.920]  criminal behavior helping criminals helping smuggle them into the united kingdom these
[3:50:57.920 --> 3:51:03.040]  leftists need to be arrested we'll be back for the final segment alex jones live info wars dot com

[3:54:15.760 --> 3:54:19.600]  and now your host paul joseph watson
[3:54:22.240 --> 3:54:26.800]  like in news out of belgium where we had a massive terrorist attack there at the airport in the
[3:54:26.800 --> 3:54:32.240]  subway back in march of last year explosion at brussel central station there's a military
[3:54:32.240 --> 3:54:37.680]  shooter suspect wearing an explosive belt there's been an explosion at brussel central station
[3:54:37.680 --> 3:54:41.920]  the military shot the individual one suspect has been shot there are no other casualties
[3:54:41.920 --> 3:54:46.480]  he was allegedly carrying a backpack and a belt of explosives and was seriously injured after he
[3:54:46.480 --> 3:54:54.240]  was neutralized so again i just said before the break while i was talking about it there was another
[3:54:54.240 --> 3:54:59.440]  another attempt at islamic terror attack but no we shouldn't be concerned about our biggest concern
[3:54:59.440 --> 3:55:04.560]  should be the amount of youtube subscribers i've got according to newsweek and tommy robinson's
[3:55:04.560 --> 3:55:10.000]  rent that's literally what the left's been saying for the past two days meanwhile you have islamic
[3:55:10.000 --> 3:55:17.520]  terror attack after islamic terror attack 147 now i've probably missed a bunch in the past 25
[3:55:17.520 --> 3:55:23.120]  days since the start of ramadan but donald trump's bad because he didn't disavow he didn't condemn
[3:55:23.120 --> 3:55:28.800]  the attack yesterday oh you want trump to condemn every single terror attack he would be doing it
[3:55:28.800 --> 3:55:35.600]  all day every day and they're all islamic so to try to equate that with the sporadic threat of
[3:55:35.600 --> 3:55:42.960]  right wing extremism is completely dishonest even in the time i was talking about it there was
[3:55:42.960 --> 3:55:49.680]  another attempted massacre in europe undoubtedly by an islamic terrorist that news is breaking
[3:55:49.680 --> 3:55:55.600]  before we get back into the news now i need to tell you about the july summer mega specials the
[3:55:55.600 --> 3:56:02.000]  fourth of july special now live at info wars store.com for a limited time plus free shipping
[3:56:02.640 --> 3:56:06.880]  i've talked about the unprecedented attacks against this alex has talked about it add
[3:56:06.880 --> 3:56:12.240]  infinite from facebook censorship to attacks on our funding sources info was is under an
[3:56:12.240 --> 3:56:17.280]  unprecedented global siege on all fronts but it's thanks to your support that we're able
[3:56:17.280 --> 3:56:23.040]  to keep the lights on and continue the fight for liberty and that can't be emphasized strongly
[3:56:23.040 --> 3:56:28.960]  enough all these other outlets all these other individuals have been taken down by mob outrage
[3:56:28.960 --> 3:56:35.280]  campaigns targeting their advertisers targeting them individually their networks they can't do that
