[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:11.000 --> 00:23.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Sunday Worldwide broadcast,
[00:23.000 --> 00:26.000]  the 17th day of April 2016.
[00:26.000 --> 00:29.000]  We'll be here for the next two hours.
[00:29.000 --> 00:32.000]  The entire 9-11 fraud is beginning to unravel.
[00:32.000 --> 00:33.000]  The 28 pages.
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.000]  You heard us talk about it 16 years ago, or 15 years ago, the congressional report the year after.
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.000]  You've heard us talk about it in the last 15 years at Nazism.
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.000]  And everything that we basically laid out has now been proven correct yet again,
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.000]  and Saudi Arabia is holding the United States hostage threatening us
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.000]  if we try to bring the information out and if it's declassified.
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  But first, a threat not of man, but of Mother Earth.
[01:02.000 --> 01:13.000]  44,000 plus people have evacuated the Japanese town of Mashiki
[01:13.000 --> 01:16.000]  on the southern portion of the land of the rising sun
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.000]  following a 7.4 magnitude earthquake that has killed at least nine and injured 858.
[01:23.000 --> 01:31.000]  If you have been paying attention, you may have noticed the frequency of earthquakes being reported in 2016 has been unyielding.
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.000]  Recently, a magnitude 6.5 earthquake hit Vanuatu.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  A magnitude 5.9 earthquake hit the southern Philippines.
[01:39.000 --> 01:48.000]  A magnitude 6.9 earthquake rocked Myanmar and on April 10th, a 6.6 magnitude quake hit Kabul with aftershocks in India.
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.000]  On April 8th, there was a magnitude 4.2 earthquake in Nepal.
[01:53.000 --> 01:59.000]  Nepal was also hit earlier with a large 5.5 magnitude quake on February 22nd.
[01:59.000 --> 02:06.000]  And in the beginning of 2016, on January 20th, there was a 6.1 magnitude earthquake in China
[02:06.000 --> 02:14.000]  and 16 days prior, 11 people had died when a 6.7 magnitude earthquake hit Manipur in India.
[02:14.000 --> 02:18.000]  Michael Snyder of End of the American Dream writes,
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  Why is the crust of the earth shaking so violently all of a sudden?
[02:22.000 --> 02:28.000]  Seismologist Bill Ham of the University of Colorado has made headlines all over the world
[02:28.000 --> 02:35.000]  by warning that current conditions might trigger at least four earthquakes greater than 8.0 in magnitude.
[02:35.000 --> 02:42.000]  If his projections are accurate, our planet could be on the precipice of a wave of natural disasters
[02:42.000 --> 02:46.000]  unlike anything that any of us have ever experienced before.
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.000]  Basically, what we saw in Japan earlier today is tiny.
[02:51.000 --> 02:58.000]  Compared to the destruction, Bill Ham has been desperately trying to compel governments all over the globe to be aware of.
[02:58.000 --> 03:03.000]  But Bill Ham has been turned away from at least one country that refused to hear the truth.
[03:03.000 --> 03:08.000]  In 2012, Indian officials deported Bill Ham when his plane arrived in New Delhi.
[03:08.000 --> 03:09.000]  Why?
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  Bill Ham had raised concerns about the dangerous seismic activity in the Jaipur region
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  where a nuclear plant was being planned.
[03:17.000 --> 03:23.000]  Meanwhile, authorities are quietly racing to monitor the many volcanoes blowing their tops.
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  Currently, there are 38 active volcanoes as the earth moves through its volcano season.
[03:28.000 --> 03:34.000]  The WorldNet Daily writes there is a 5% to a 10% chance in the next 80 years.
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  Scientists say one of these eruptions will kill millions of people and poison the atmosphere
[03:39.000 --> 03:44.000]  beyond the imagination of anything man's activity could do in a thousand years.
[03:44.000 --> 03:50.000]  And no one is yet making any plans to deal with the calamitous possibilities.
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  But earthquakes are earthquakes and I don't know.
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  Hopefully, we just won't ever have to worry about it.
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.000]  How does that make you feel living here and running a business here?
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  It just feels kind of awkward.
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  I didn't know about that fault.
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  We've had earthquakes here in the last two or three months that weren't as big as this.
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.000]  But I'm just happy that I have a building that I know that can withstand it.
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.000]  This relatively unknown fault line that was here.
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.000]  And you can see where the road has just separated into.
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  It was pushed up against each other directly in this area.
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.000]  Sidewalks are about three feet high in some places.
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  True to California fashion, some of the children have seen this as their opportunity
[04:36.000 --> 04:43.000]  to have their own makeshift bike ramps and skate ramps trying to make the best of this situation.
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.000]  All eyes should be on the ring of fire as the trenches activate the tectonic plates
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  at exponential levels and earthquake news events multiply.
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  John Bown for Informs.com.
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.000]  We'll be back. Stay with us.
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  At a time where airport security is at an all-time high,
[05:03.000 --> 05:08.000]  one may be shocked to discover that drug sniffing dogs at a Manchester airport
[05:08.000 --> 05:11.000]  aren't sniffing on any, well, drugs.
[05:11.000 --> 05:15.000]  The BBC reports the use of sniffer dogs at Manchester airport
[05:15.000 --> 05:21.000]  has been criticized after dogs fell to discover any class A drugs in a seven month period.
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.000]  So if these highly trained dogs weren't able to find any drugs,
[05:25.000 --> 05:27.000]  what exactly were they sniffing out?
[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  Well, the report documents plenty of sausage and cheese.
[05:31.000 --> 05:38.000]  Meanwhile, here in the States, there have been numerous reports of excessively long lines at TSA checkpoints.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  And while some will say that the agency is understaffed,
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.000]  my retort is that if they weren't making handicapped people stand out of wheelchairs,
[05:46.000 --> 05:51.000]  giving pat-downs to small children and checking the contents of your Altoids tin,
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  they wouldn't need as many people.
[05:53.000 --> 06:19.000]  Find more reports on infowars.com.
[06:24.000 --> 06:27.000]  There is a paradox.
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  Thank you for joining us on this live Sunday Worldwide Transmission,
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  the 17th day of April, 2016.
[06:34.000 --> 06:39.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. I'm here every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[06:39.000 --> 06:44.000]  And then, of course, we return weekdays 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  in Full Wars Nightly News. Also airs 7 o'clock Central.
[06:47.000 --> 06:53.000]  Find all the details at infowars.com in the Listen and Watch section.
[06:53.000 --> 06:58.000]  This is primarily a radio slash TV multimedia transmission.
[06:58.000 --> 07:02.000]  And, of course, we are simulcasting on radio and television.
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.000]  Anyone listening on radio can simply go to infowars.com forward slash show
[07:07.000 --> 07:13.000]  to find all the free podcast, audio feeds, video feeds, droid apps, iPhone apps.
[07:13.000 --> 07:18.000]  All free infowars.com forward slash show.
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  It's a paradox.
[07:20.000 --> 07:23.000]  My job is getting easier all the time
[07:23.000 --> 07:27.000]  because the globalists are just out in the open trying to hide their crimes
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000]  in plain view now because they can't basically bamboozle or hoodwink
[07:32.000 --> 07:37.000]  the public into not understanding that it exists anymore.
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  So what I was covering 21 years ago on air,
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.000]  what Barry Goldwater was fighting 50 years ago in the Senate,
[07:44.000 --> 07:49.000]  what Ron Paul was fighting 30 years ago in Congress,
[07:49.000 --> 07:51.000]  was very stealth.
[07:51.000 --> 07:54.000]  But now exactly what the old-timers told us they were planning,
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.000]  and they had the documents, was mainly government whistleblowers,
[07:58.000 --> 08:03.000]  top military brass members of Congress, and you name it, they went public.
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  They'd write a book, they'd warn people, the mainstream media would make fun of them,
[08:08.000 --> 08:11.000]  but people listened and the seeds were planted.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  And as the global government grew exponentially, but still incrementally,
[08:15.000 --> 08:18.000]  like a metastasizing cancer,
[08:18.000 --> 08:22.000]  there was countless individuals and groups out there that went out,
[08:22.000 --> 08:29.000]  did their own research, and verified what nationalist pro-freedom patriots
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  had warned them about.
[08:31.000 --> 08:37.000]  So those Paul Revere's, going back to 1913 that fought the establishment
[08:37.000 --> 08:41.000]  of the private Federal Reserve and others.
[08:41.000 --> 08:51.000]  Those patriots in the last 100-plus years are the reason today we have a fighting chance.
[08:51.000 --> 08:56.000]  Think about how awake the general public is now to the fact that the stock market's rigged,
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.000]  the interest rates are rigged, the currency speculation is rigged,
[09:00.000 --> 09:06.000]  the gold and silver markets are rigged, that the Federal Reserve again is private.
[09:06.000 --> 09:11.000]  The public is beginning to wake up and understand that we have a multinational oligarchy
[09:11.000 --> 09:17.000]  of private offshore corporations conquering the globe
[09:17.000 --> 09:21.000]  and seeking to dumb us down and create artificial civilization
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  that disconnects us from common sense and domesticates us
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.000]  because they've stolen the world, now they want to keep what they've stolen.
[09:30.000 --> 09:39.000]  Now, that said, the paradox is, it's out in the open now.
[09:39.000 --> 09:48.000]  But the part of the paradox that makes it not be so easy is that they're doing so much so fast
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  and moving so quickly and don't care and have institutional control
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.000]  and don't get in trouble, that they're above the law.
[09:57.000 --> 10:03.000]  And so there's this moment of collective cognitive dissonance or it's beyond that,
[10:03.000 --> 10:06.000]  this moment of collective shrugging the shoulders and saying,
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  what are you going to do about it?
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  This moment of collective giving up, and not everybody's given up,
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.000]  but a large portion of people that are aware of what's happening just say,
[10:16.000 --> 10:17.000]  you're not going to change it.
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.000]  Well, let me tell those people something.
[10:21.000 --> 10:28.000]  If you lay down to tyranny, it will only progress and get worse like cancer.
[10:28.000 --> 10:40.000]  You have to throw sand in the gears of anti-human, unconstitutional, anti-family, totalitarian baloney.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  It's like saying, I don't want to have to breathe, it's work.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  You die if you don't.
[10:45.000 --> 10:48.000]  Or, I don't want to have to walk around the block with a dog.
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.000]  You know, it's too boring and it's tiring.
[10:51.000 --> 10:54.000]  You'll end up dying 20, 30 years young.
[10:54.000 --> 10:58.000]  You'll end up in a wheelchair when you're 50, living like that.
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  It's not work to fight tyranny.
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  It's not work to be informed.
[11:03.000 --> 11:05.000]  It's animating.
[11:05.000 --> 11:07.000]  It's the animating contest of liberty.
[11:07.000 --> 11:09.000]  It's what it's all about.
[11:09.000 --> 11:16.000]  Now, that said, we've got a big now hour and 49 minutes lined up before us here today.
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  Incredible naked theft.
[11:20.000 --> 11:28.000]  In Georgia, where Trump won handily, they just took the delegates, the Associated Press announced it like it was no big deal.
[11:28.000 --> 11:33.000]  And that's the bigger story is how the mainstream media goes along with this.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  Another headline in FullWars.com.
[11:35.000 --> 11:37.000]  It's also in Yahoo.
[11:37.000 --> 11:41.000]  Cruz wins another voterless contest in Wyoming.
[11:41.000 --> 11:47.000]  And he called it a, quote, grassroots victory of the voters, close quote.
[11:47.000 --> 11:55.000]  A total inversion of reality.
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  So that's up on infowars.com.
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  We're going to be breaking all of that down.
[12:00.000 --> 12:10.000]  Ted Cruz celebrates Wyoming win calling voterless contest a grassroots uprising.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  Party bosses plan to rob Trump in Wyoming and Indiana.
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  Yeah, there we are a few days ago telling you about that.
[12:15.000 --> 12:16.000]  They've now done it.
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.000]  And don't worry, UN Human Rights Commission blast Trump's hateful slander of foreigners.
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  You know who runs the commission?
[12:23.000 --> 12:28.000]  Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and other dictator ships in the Middle East.
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.000]  That's actually who runs the commission is Saudi Arabia.
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.000]  That's like having, I don't know, who's the most famous child molester in US history?
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  I don't know the answer to that.
[12:39.000 --> 12:44.000]  You guys ask Google, who is the most famous or most notorious child molester?
[12:44.000 --> 12:50.000]  It'd be like putting a child molester over the local neighborhood watch program for children or something.
[12:50.000 --> 12:58.000]  Saudi Arabia that chops women's heads off that refuse to wear headdresses, beaky pursuits,
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.000]  and that chops homosexuals heads off.
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.000]  But see the homosexuals, they're mad I'm using the word homosexual.
[13:04.000 --> 13:05.000]  They don't care.
[13:05.000 --> 13:08.000]  Saudi Arabia chops their head off.
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.000]  I'm using the word homosexual, not because I dislike you,
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  but because you're not going to tell me what words to use.
[13:13.000 --> 13:16.000]  That's cult garbage.
[13:16.000 --> 13:23.000]  UN Rights Chief decries bigotry in the US presidential race.
[13:23.000 --> 13:32.000]  UN Rights Chief, Jordan and Saudi Arabia run the stinking thing.
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  We're going to get to all of that.
[13:34.000 --> 13:39.000]  There's a stack of censorship news coming up from all over the world against nationalists,
[13:39.000 --> 13:48.000]  against fathers, against Christians, against patriots, against the most law-abiding, decent people.
[13:48.000 --> 13:57.000]  Merkel is going to arrest the person on TV that wrote a poem about the dictator, basically, of Turkey.
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.000]  He has staged elections, but it's admitted he kills anybody that gets in his way.
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.000]  He's going to arrest newspaper chiefs, you name it, Ergun. Germany's going to arrest.
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.000]  See, by the way, even the Seattle Post intelligence are asked,
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  man, the Black Lives Matter people and other social justice warriors,
[14:13.000 --> 14:16.000]  they won't let anybody have free speech. They attack people.
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  Is that okay? Is that their safe space now?
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  And they go, yes, it is their safe space.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  You don't get free speech when the left says so.
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  The whole world's a safe space, a free speech zone for you,
[14:27.000 --> 14:34.000]  but they have free speech because they are fascist, brown shirt, low-brow idiots.
[14:34.000 --> 14:39.000]  I mean, you go out to a Sanders rally or a Hillary rally and these social justice warriors,
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  I don't care if they're black or white, they can hardly talk.
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.000]  And we've got more than 30 videos on infowars.com, Facebook.
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  We shot them live on Facebook, live on Ustream, live on InfoWars.
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.000]  There's live everywhere. When I say 30 or 40 or 50, there's like 100 videos.
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  I can't even count them. I couldn't even watch them all. They're also insane.
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.000]  Like the worst 10 or 15 or so are on the website, on infowars.com.
[15:03.000 --> 15:08.000]  I mean, it is crazy. They were in New York where the anti-Trump people
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.000]  attacked free speech and went crazy and beat people up for no reason.
[15:11.000 --> 15:14.000]  Even folks who were just out there observing, they just beat them up.
[15:14.000 --> 15:19.000]  The police, of course, let them do it because that's white privilege to be attacked for your race
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  and be left alone and no one protects you.
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  And then our crew went out to Denver where they stole last week the popular vote.
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.000]  I mean, forget Donald Trump, but they love him or hate him. They stole that.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  Our crew went and covered that Friday.
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  And then yesterday, they were in Portland, Oregon at the university
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  where the left shut down six Trump supporters last week who were students
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  and said, don't try to have free speech. It's over.
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.000]  We went there. We conquered. Info Warriors showed up by the hundreds.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  And we restored. That's the real story.
[15:47.000 --> 15:53.000]  The first amendment that's been fought so hard for since 1776 that these dirt bags wanted to bury.
[15:53.000 --> 16:18.000]  And Saudi Arabia is trying to hold its hostage. Stay with us.
[16:24.000 --> 16:30.000]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimentical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12,
[16:30.000 --> 16:35.000]  methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[16:35.000 --> 16:38.000]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[16:38.000 --> 16:43.000]  No needles, no injections. Don't take my word for it. Try it for yourself.
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  Discover the secret. Secret 12.

[16:53.000 --> 17:20.000]  Info Wars Life, Secret 12.
[17:20.000 --> 17:29.000]  Secret 12.
[17:29.000 --> 17:37.000]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated, or maximum potency.
[17:37.000 --> 17:41.000]  They want to stun and dumb down, and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while,
[17:41.000 --> 17:47.000]  but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[17:47.000 --> 17:50.000]  So, it's pretty exciting, and I love it.
[17:50.000 --> 18:19.000]  Secret 12.
[18:19.000 --> 18:26.000]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated, or maximum potency.
[18:26.000 --> 18:35.000]  Secret 13.
[18:35.000 --> 18:58.000]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[18:58.000 --> 19:02.000]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[19:02.000 --> 19:28.000]  Secret 14.
[19:28.000 --> 19:35.000]  Sour filters. We're introducing the best yet. The brand new Pro Pure Pro Max High Performance Sour Filter.

[20:01.000 --> 20:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:09.000 --> 20:38.000]  Secret 15.
[20:38.000 --> 20:43.000]  That's right, raising the debt. The national debt does not raise the debt, and now they've given the president.
[20:43.000 --> 20:48.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.000]  Blanket control going out to the next president to just put us into any debt they want.
[20:53.000 --> 20:56.000]  We're being maneuvered into total receivership, total bankruptcy.
[20:56.000 --> 21:02.000]  And I want new listeners and viewers to understand something.
[21:02.000 --> 21:11.000]  You are not hearing rhetoric. I mean, this is what global government is, is what the new world order is, is mega banks controlling huge corporate combines,
[21:11.000 --> 21:16.000]  taking over nation states and maneuvering them towards total collapse.
[21:16.000 --> 21:22.000]  That is the Agenda 21 Cloward and Piven Globalist Program of Dependency.
[21:22.000 --> 21:31.000]  So coming up, the theft of more states like Georgia and Wyoming, and they even had a popular vote in Georgia.
[21:31.000 --> 21:41.000]  And when Trump won, they just said, no, we're giving it to Ted Cruz, like Tennessee, like Louisiana, and so many other states like Arizona.
[21:41.000 --> 21:51.000]  But instead, they're doing a new thing where they just go, oh, we changed the rules where if we wanted to, months ago, we can, in Wyoming and Colorado and all those other states,
[21:51.000 --> 21:55.000]  we can just not even have the election.
[21:55.000 --> 22:04.000]  And then when DrudgeReport.com and Infowars.com points out this is crazy and this is wrong, they have mainstream media come out and go, can you believe these nuts?
[22:04.000 --> 22:08.000]  They claim there's something called voters.
[22:08.000 --> 22:14.000]  But it is backfiring on the public. The public is understanding what's happening.
[22:14.000 --> 22:22.000]  They get that there is a fraud going on and it's a huge wake-up call. I mean, look at this Hill article.
[22:22.000 --> 22:29.000]  RNC chief, no changes to delegate requirements likely.
[22:29.000 --> 22:35.000]  And then he goes on to say, yeah, the delegates can just represent whoever they want, even though they're pledged to the voters and the precinct.
[22:35.000 --> 22:43.000]  And there's another article, Republican Party delegates feel sudden power as ballot shifts.
[22:43.000 --> 22:52.000]  It'd be like if you had 10 employees at a restaurant and you showed up as the owner and they told you, we formed a union, we're throwing you out, we own your business now.
[22:52.000 --> 22:57.000]  And they really believe because they say so that that's the case.
[22:57.000 --> 23:03.000]  It's like Kim Jong-un, the son of Kim Jong-il, the son of his dad, the dictator, they become royalty and he really believes,
[23:03.000 --> 23:13.000]  waddling around, unable to size his own shoelaces, that he is God-imboror of the poor slaves and they can't produce anything worse than Cuba.
[23:13.000 --> 23:18.000]  No cars, they can produce nothing, nothing.
[23:18.000 --> 23:23.000]  All they've got is a bunch of Chinese and Russian artillery and old rotting tanks from the 50s.
[23:23.000 --> 23:30.000]  But it doesn't matter, he's obese and went to a prep school in Switzerland, so it's okay.
[23:30.000 --> 23:36.000]  And there's lots of uniforms and lots of spies and lots of control over what language you use.
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  Oh, it's just such a big power trip.
[23:38.000 --> 23:42.000]  Look at the photo right above that one where he's looking off the one next to it.
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  Yeah, no, three.
[23:44.000 --> 23:45.000]  Yeah, that one, look at that.
[23:45.000 --> 23:48.000]  Look at the power trip, murdering, executing whoever he wants.
[23:48.000 --> 23:51.000]  The guy can't even bench press probably 45 pounds.
[23:51.000 --> 24:02.000]  But he rules a state because it's perfect for him in history, only a big bloated evil government would want such a thing running it.
[24:02.000 --> 24:07.000]  But all you pseudo-intellectuals about Bernie Sanders, by the way, when we come back from break, we're going to break in a while,
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.000]  but when we come back, Bill Clinton finally told the truth.
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.000]  I'm stunned by it.
[24:12.000 --> 24:13.000]  This is a big deal.
[24:13.000 --> 24:14.000]  We're going to cover that.
[24:14.000 --> 24:15.000]  So let me tell you what's coming up.
[24:15.000 --> 24:22.000]  Bill Clinton told the truth, we're going to get into the election being stolen all across the country by the RNC.
[24:22.000 --> 24:28.000]  We're going to get into billion-dollar lawsuit filed following Deutsche Bank's admission of gold-silver rigging.
[24:28.000 --> 24:36.000]  We're going to get into the world's strongest earthquakes now hitting, ever recorded, and the most frequent.
[24:36.000 --> 24:45.000]  And there's one area that hasn't been hit, and it's two-plus years overdue according to all the mainline seismologists and people that study earthquakes
[24:45.000 --> 24:52.000]  and the volcanologists that study the volcanoes and the rest of it.
[24:52.000 --> 24:57.000]  A bunch of earthquakes today hitting Japan, a bunch hitting just all over the world yesterday.
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[24:59.000 --> 25:02.000]  We're going to break all that down.
[25:02.000 --> 25:13.000]  And we're also going to be getting into, as I mentioned, the massive censorship and just outright political persecution going on by the so-called left.
[25:13.000 --> 25:17.000]  And see, the left traditionally are the ones sticking up for civil liberties and human rights.
[25:17.000 --> 25:26.000]  So the establishment worldwide is coming after rights from a twisted leftist perspective because they want to get the leftist opposition to stand down and put up with it.
[25:26.000 --> 25:32.000]  And it's a master stroke, but man, it's really getting crazy. It's really getting out of control.
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  And we got Rob Deuce coming on at the start of the next hour.
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  He's at DFW right now, just flew in from Portland.
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  They were again in Portland before that.
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.000]  They were in Denver, Colorado fighting against the theft election there that happened last week.
[25:46.000 --> 25:54.000]  And then, of course, before that, they were in New York where the anti-Trump people were attacking just people that were out there for free speech, period.
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  A lot of folks we talked to weren't even supporting Trump. They just came out to see it.
[25:58.000 --> 26:01.000]  But if they were white, they were attacked.
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.000]  One guy was out there promoting the Second Amendment and just saying, look, we need to defend free speech and the Second Amendment.
[26:06.000 --> 26:12.000]  So he got attacked and beat up, and the police did nothing.
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.000]  So I'm not looking for trouble, but anyway, when I go to Cleveland and other places, anybody thinks they're going to knock me upside down.
[26:18.000 --> 26:25.000]  I got some news for you. I kick like a mule and I bite like a crocodile.
[26:25.000 --> 26:31.000]  And so, okay, all right, go ahead. Go ahead.
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.000]  And I'll probably get arrested. It'll be on video.
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  Somebody pops me in the head. I'm going to pop them right in their nose.
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.000]  I'm going to pop them right in their eye, pop them right in their throat, depending on...
[26:41.000 --> 26:45.000]  Somebody really goes after me. I'm going to target. I'm going to target.
[26:45.000 --> 26:49.000]  And you can find out. And I'm sure you're big and tough. I get it.
[26:49.000 --> 26:55.000]  And they're watching Oprah Winfrey on TV all day and even glowing the dark GMO cereal.
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.000]  It's just that I am coming to execute the First Amendment and I will defend it.
[27:00.000 --> 27:03.000]  So that's what it comes down to.
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.000]  It's just amazing.
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  No, I will be in Cleveland with no bodyguards. That's what I do.
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.000]  I get down there in the street, folks. That's who I am.
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.000]  And good Lord above is my protection.
[27:17.000 --> 27:23.000]  And I mean, I guess I've had a few concealed carry people here and there now when I'm out.
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.000]  But I mean, whatever, the point is some loon is going to do what a loon is going to do.
[27:27.000 --> 27:34.000]  And so I'm here openly saying I'm not a coward like Bloomberg, who has 15 bodyguards on average.
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.000]  We have video of it in New York, but after he was out, we visited Austin, other cities trying to ban our right to own guns.
[27:39.000 --> 27:44.000]  People that don't have the money to have 15 bodyguards and he'll have 15 bodyguards with guns.
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  But he wants you disarmed and alone and cold in your home.
[27:48.000 --> 27:54.000]  And so many low level predators aren't even part of the establishment, but they get this instinct to serve the establishment
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  and they love it and they get off on it.
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  And they think of themselves as the elite and they love the idea of lots of little disarmed slaves
[28:01.000 --> 28:09.000]  and they imagine how they're commasars and political apparatuses of the system.
[28:09.000 --> 28:13.000]  But the first thing I'm going to cover when we return, I'm going to start now getting into the articles.
[28:13.000 --> 28:18.000]  I've mentioned a smattering of what's coming up. Now we're going to start covering it.
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.000]  Do I get a Pulitzer Prize? Not that I want one.
[28:21.000 --> 28:27.000]  I mean, I wouldn't want a Nobel Prize for literature or a Nobel Prize for journalism or a Nobel Prize for peace
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.000]  because they give them to Al Gore, Henry Kissinger, Barack Obama.
[28:31.000 --> 28:38.000]  It's like being given a tyrant of the year award or something.
[28:38.000 --> 28:44.000]  But I don't get an award from being the first to say they were going to stage an attack before 9-11 and then on 9-11
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.000]  and that the Saudi Arabia was involved and our government stood down.
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.000]  It's now all over mainstream news headlines.
[28:50.000 --> 28:57.000]  Saudi Arabia threatens to pull 750 billion from the U.S. economy and Congress allows them to be sued for 9-11 terror attacks.
[29:21.000 --> 29:27.000]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity

[31:58.000 --> 32:02.000]  Anthony Gootsiarty here with an Info Wars Health News Update with Alex Jones.
[32:02.000 --> 32:06.000]  That's right Anthony, one of our top selling products is BrainForce.
[32:06.000 --> 32:10.000]  It is very affordably priced at retail that we normally discount it.
[32:10.000 --> 32:17.000]  We've discounted from the discount 25% but if you count it from its regular price, that's 45% discount
[32:17.000 --> 32:20.000]  for a limited time at infowarslife.com.
[32:20.000 --> 32:23.000]  There are a lot of brain boosters out there or what's known as new tropics.
[32:23.000 --> 32:26.000]  But here's what separates BrainForce from the rest.
[32:26.000 --> 32:31.000]  Unlike some energy drinks and supplements, BrainForce uses natural brain activation ingredients like
[32:31.000 --> 32:38.000]  Gherbamante extract, AlphaGPC, L-Theanine, HyperXine A, Phosphatidylserine, B12 and many others.
[32:38.000 --> 32:43.000]  Major nutraceutical review sites rave about this formulation and they also rave about the price.
[32:43.000 --> 32:50.000]  Secure your BrainForce today at infowarslife.com and get 45% off retail, 25% off the regular sales price
[32:50.000 --> 33:15.000]  on BrainForce for a limited time at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[33:20.000 --> 33:40.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[33:40.000 --> 33:47.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:47.000 --> 33:54.000]  Coming up next hour, we're getting into election 2016 with Richard Reeves popping in from on the road,
[33:54.000 --> 34:00.000]  Rob doing the crew at the Dallas airport flying in from Portland where the left announced
[34:00.000 --> 34:04.000]  the Portland State College there.
[34:04.000 --> 34:11.000]  We do not allow free speech, we do not allow students to have Trump events or basically any other conservative events.
[34:11.000 --> 34:18.000]  And so hundreds of info warriors showed up to say no to that and they were out there all day trying to stop our free speech,
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  they were shut down.
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  That footage is there and more.
[34:22.000 --> 34:27.000]  Also our crew up there reporting and openly being biased for voters being able to vote,
[34:27.000 --> 34:33.000]  being openly biased to tell the truth, being openly biased to promote America and freedom.
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  We were out there covering the hundreds and hundreds of people.
[34:36.000 --> 34:44.000]  The estimated about 400 Rob do did demonstrating in front of the RNC headquarters there in Denver where they just said,
[34:44.000 --> 34:50.000]  we're not going to have voters this time, we're going to suspend it and the party is going to give the 34 delegates to Ted Cruz.
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  And that's now happened a week later.
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.000]  Cruz wins another voterless contest in Wyoming.
[34:55.000 --> 35:01.000]  Again, he won Georgia but it's been given to Ted Cruz even though they had a vote there.
[35:01.000 --> 35:05.000]  The voters are just being ignored and they're saying you are now ceremonial.
[35:05.000 --> 35:10.000]  And everything's normal and you're a conspiracy theorist if you don't buy into that, that's coming up.
[35:10.000 --> 35:17.000]  But don't worry, the Saudi Arabian government is on the Human Rights Commission and it's headed up by the Jordan government,
[35:17.000 --> 35:23.000]  that's the chair, and they're criticizing Donald Trump and investigating him saying we should have borders.
[35:23.000 --> 35:34.000]  They have total control of their borders and chop thousands of people's heads off every year including people for their sexual preference and orientation.
[35:34.000 --> 35:45.000]  But don't worry, Circus Soleil, I'm going to be covering this, is banning coming to a bunch of states that have passed pro-Christian laws saying Christians can't be persecuted
[35:45.000 --> 35:49.000]  if they won't bake a cake for somebody or something.
[35:49.000 --> 35:58.000]  But Circus Soleil is going to the Middle East to all the top countries that murder anyone for their sexual preference that isn't,
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.000]  well, they'll kill you if you commit adultery too.
[36:01.000 --> 36:06.000]  It's all bull, it's all about bullying America.
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.000]  Oh, Donald Trump said we might have a border, it's so evil.
[36:10.000 --> 36:15.000]  Wall Street Journal, Chinese finance minister takes aim at Donald Trump's trade policies.
[36:15.000 --> 36:22.000]  Yeah, they have 35 to 40% currency tariffs on us and then they tell us we're screwing you, nothing's made in your country,
[36:22.000 --> 36:29.000]  ah, the Chinese general's on everything, we murder political dissidents, kill Buddhists and sell their organs and you listen to us.
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.000]  Hitler, they call Trump Hitler, you Hitler.
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  Does Trump have mobile execution vans?
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  Does he kill Buddhist priests?
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.000]  No, you do, you do.
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  And so you take his Hitler.
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.000]  Radunculus.
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  There is no end to the level of this bull.
[36:49.000 --> 36:53.000]  But now, let's get into Saudi Arabia.
[36:53.000 --> 36:54.000]  This is a big deal.
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  Let's go to drudgerport.com.
[36:56.000 --> 37:05.000]  And I tell you, you go to infowars.com, there's one little article linked there from a couple days ago when they first made this thread on Friday down at the bottom of the page.
[37:05.000 --> 37:14.000]  You talk about a day late, a dollar short, we're a thousand days early and got $10 trillion too much.
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  I mean, that'd be the example of this.
[37:18.000 --> 37:29.000]  Because you'd think something that we're so on top of that we were the progenitors of, that we took all the heat on, we'd be covering.
[37:29.000 --> 37:32.000]  When our time comes, but see, we don't do that.
[37:32.000 --> 37:35.000]  We're already light years ahead dealing with the latest.
[37:35.000 --> 37:42.000]  Like we told you 10 months ago, they're going to cancel elections and just give all the delegates to whoever the Republican anointed one is.
[37:42.000 --> 37:43.000]  We now know it's Ted Cruz.
[37:43.000 --> 37:50.000]  And here it is, RNC defends voterless elections, don't give a darn.
[37:50.000 --> 37:51.000]  But look right here.
[37:51.000 --> 37:52.000]  I'm at drudgerport.com.
[37:52.000 --> 37:53.000]  Drudge is cutting edge too.
[37:53.000 --> 37:58.000]  I'm just pointing out that he's cutting edge before and then when it's time to be cutting edge to take credit.
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  We are way before and then never give us credit.
[38:01.000 --> 38:04.000]  And I'm not bragging about how accurate we are.
[38:04.000 --> 38:10.000]  I'm just telling you, folks, you should pay attention to us and realize we're already ahead to the next big thing.
[38:10.000 --> 38:16.000]  Because we tend to launch any new movement or understanding of what's going on.
[38:16.000 --> 38:21.000]  Just like last week, we first reported on Russian jets buzzing.
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  U.S. aircraft carriers and ships.
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.000]  No one else was covering it.
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  Now it's all over mainstream news.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  Drudge linked to our article on Friday.
[38:28.000 --> 38:32.000]  And then new events have happened and Drudge has got those linked.
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  And that's how Drudge leads the news.
[38:34.000 --> 38:35.000]  We lead the news as well.
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.000]  I'm just pointing out to you that remember in 2001, 9-11 took place.
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  I was on over 120 affiliates.
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.000]  I was already on 120 affiliates or more.
[38:46.000 --> 38:49.000]  A lot of them big stations.
[38:49.000 --> 39:00.000]  And the station manager started calling and they said, stop saying that there was a stand down ordered and that Saudi Arabia hijackers were CIA and stop saying that the FBI says they were ordered to stand down.
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  Stop saying the government did it or you're off the air.
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.000]  And I lost probably 80 affiliates.
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.000]  I lost close to 70%.
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  But it's better than losing my soul.
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  Now a lot of those stations came back later and picked us back up.
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  A lot of them have been bought or sold since then.
[39:17.000 --> 39:22.000]  But what I'm getting at is, in the beginning a patriot's a scarce man, hated, feared and scorned.
[39:22.000 --> 39:27.000]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the Tim had joined him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot.
[39:27.000 --> 39:30.000]  The media misrepresented what I said about 9-11.
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.000]  They also built strawmen and they tried to shut us up, but we didn't shut up.
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  And I had the FBI agents on.
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  I had the whistleblowers on.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  I had them all on, folks.
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.000]  I had Springman, the head of the visa section of the embassy whose associates told him they were ordered to let the hijackers in.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  It was a secret CIA program.
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.000]  I told you there were drills on 9-11 from our sources of the exact same targets being hit.
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  That later all came out in mainstream news.
[39:54.000 --> 40:06.000]  And I risked my life doing that to tell the truth because I'm not going to sit here when something comes out that is destroying human liberty and freedom and threatening our whole future.
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.000]  They used the attacks to take our freedoms and try to butcher our republic, folks.
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.000]  So I had a responsibility to expose it.
[40:14.000 --> 40:22.000]  And now I've had members of Congress on, former members of the Senate on, FBI translators on, NSA translators on, Sybil Edmonds and others.
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  I've had them all on, folks.
[40:24.000 --> 40:31.000]  And now NBC News headline, secret 28 pages of 9-11 report under new scrutiny.
[40:31.000 --> 40:40.000]  Saudi Arabia threatens to pull $750 billion from U.S. economy if Congress allows them to be sued for 9-11 terror attacks.
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  That's New York Daily News.
[40:42.000 --> 40:50.000]  Continuing, and this is the really important article right here, secret 28 pages of 9-11 report under new scrutiny.
[40:50.000 --> 40:54.000]  And then it goes into the U.S. government standing down.
[40:54.000 --> 41:00.000]  Here is the New York Post, how U.S. covered up Saudi role in 9-11.
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.000]  And when you cover up a role, you're now complicit.
[41:03.000 --> 41:07.000]  And they covered it up day one, ordering a NORAD stand down.
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.000]  And I've interviewed members of Congress that said they cried when they read the secret congressional report.
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.000]  Not the 9-11 commission, the congressional report that was done the first year.
[41:16.000 --> 41:21.000]  And then six of the 10 commissioners have gone public and said there's a cover-up
[41:21.000 --> 41:26.000]  and that you need to have their report released, not the public one, but their secret one as well.
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.000]  Who's vindicated? Who told you Saudi Arabia working with criminal elements of our government?
[41:31.000 --> 41:34.000]  And you see Obama today. This is bipartisan.
[41:34.000 --> 41:40.000]  Working with the jihadis, working with them in Libya, in Syria, in Egypt to overthrow governments,
[41:40.000 --> 41:45.000]  working with them all over the world, protecting them, giving them weapons, giving them stinger missiles,
[41:45.000 --> 41:49.000]  Gaza, all of it. We have been proven right. And let me tell you why I savor this.
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  Not because it proves I'm right, but because I did the right thing.
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.000]  I sacrificed career and future and tons of money.
[41:57.000 --> 42:03.000]  You ought to try being 26, 27, 28 years old.
[42:03.000 --> 42:07.000]  I'm 42 now, however old I was on 9-11.
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.000]  And to be sitting there out of my home studio on over 100 plus stations, some of them big.
[42:12.000 --> 42:17.000]  And the biggest syndicators in the world saying we want to hire you right now.
[42:17.000 --> 42:22.000]  We want to pay you $5 million a year and a book deal. Come work for us.
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  And you know what? I didn't do it.
[42:24.000 --> 42:27.000]  And I can stand here and be an honorable person.
[42:27.000 --> 42:31.000]  And no, I was right. I was proven right. I did the right thing.
[42:31.000 --> 42:36.000]  And now the globalists are panicking in a deep trouble and it will come out and all the rest of it will come out
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  and nothing on earth can stop it. You guys can start wars.
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  You can have al-Qaeda attack you brought into the country and divert from this. It won't work.
[42:43.000 --> 42:50.000]  We know criminal elements of our government and the Global Federal Reserve Combine are running jihad operations
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  as their secret proxy army with Saudi Arabia.
[42:53.000 --> 43:20.000]  And the whole thing's been blown wide open and the Pentagon is now exposing it.

[45:24.000 --> 45:29.000]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[45:54.000 --> 46:01.000]  For more than two years ago, infowars first told you about our research
[46:01.000 --> 46:04.000]  into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[46:04.000 --> 46:09.000]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ
[46:09.000 --> 46:13.000]  and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food
[46:13.000 --> 46:17.000]  and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[46:17.000 --> 46:21.000]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.000]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today,
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.000]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[46:28.000 --> 46:35.000]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[46:35.000 --> 46:41.000]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.000]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view,
[46:47.000 --> 46:53.000]  to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at infowarslife.com
[46:53.000 --> 47:22.000]  or by calling 888-253-3139.
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  Now, I use DrudgeReport.com as an example pretty much every show
[47:26.000 --> 47:34.000]  because it's the dominant news site in the world, more traffic than Facebook and the New York Times combined.
[47:34.000 --> 47:42.000]  And why? Well, I mean, Drudge sees them canceling elections all over the country
[47:42.000 --> 47:50.000]  or taking elections where Trump's won now in six states and giving it to Ted Cruz,
[47:50.000 --> 47:55.000]  which says, wow, let's link to a headline pointing out it's voterless.
[47:55.000 --> 48:00.000]  And then Ted Cruz and the dinosaur media and the RNC come out and say,
[48:00.000 --> 48:06.000]  Matt Drudge used to be good till he started listening to Alex Jones and came to visit him.
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.000]  Alex Jones has done something to him. That's been in multiple newspapers.
[48:10.000 --> 48:17.000]  Glenn Beck says that. No. Drudge was on radio 15 years ago talking about human cloning
[48:17.000 --> 48:23.000]  and how dangerous it is. I mean, what are you talking about? And GMO.
[48:23.000 --> 48:29.000]  I mean, we got people like Ted Nugent and Chuck Norris coming out concerned about GMO
[48:29.000 --> 48:32.000]  because they've read the studies. It isn't a left or right issue.
[48:32.000 --> 48:37.000]  It's common sense that when you don't have an election, you've got a problem.
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.000]  Bernie Sanders keeps winning states and they're giving it to Hillary.
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.000]  I can't stand Bernie Sanders when I'm worried about the integrity of our system.
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.000]  And they steal it in the open. They've been stealing it for a while here and there,
[48:48.000 --> 48:57.000]  trying to at least. But now they just do it in the open in this big Psyop.
[48:57.000 --> 49:03.000]  And why else is Drudge successful, just like in FullWars.com is?
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  Well, because when it's in, you know, a congressman comes out a year ago,
[49:07.000 --> 49:11.000]  like Walter Jones and comes on our show and says, you know, this is what's inside the 28 pages
[49:11.000 --> 49:14.000]  and Saudi Arabia ran the attacks and NORAB was ordered to stand down.
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.000]  And it's going to implicate the Clintons and the Bushes and probably bring down a major government.
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.000]  But it needs to come out. Drudge linked to our article.
[49:22.000 --> 49:28.000]  I guess Drudge was concerned. Oh, and look at the results of the families and Trump talking about it.
[49:28.000 --> 49:32.000]  We advise Trump to talk about it. He's also a New Yorker. I'm just going to leave it at that.
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  We asked Trump to come out against the Federal Reserve. He did one week later.
[49:35.000 --> 49:40.000]  Roger Stone said, watch what happens next week. And it happened, didn't it?
[49:40.000 --> 49:44.000]  By the way, he didn't tell Trump what to say. Trump was already mad at the Federal Reserve.
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  He just reminded him to bring it up.
[49:46.000 --> 49:50.000]  Turns out Trump's been reading books like none dare call a conspiracy since the 70s.
[49:50.000 --> 49:54.000]  And I'm going to stop right there. But I'm going to tell you.
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.000]  I've been told by Dr. Corsi and a bunch of other folks have known him for 40 years.
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  Trump is a closet anti-New World Order guy.
[50:01.000 --> 50:06.000]  He just knows the stigma the media has pushed and is just bringing the issues out instead of the buzzwords.
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.000]  He liked the 28 pages a few months ago and look at what's happening.
[50:10.000 --> 50:18.000]  See, pebble in the stream, pebble in the pond, and the ripples it sends out.
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.000]  Just like I told you a few months ago, the 9-11 hoax is coming down.
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  They want to come out and say, Joan says Bush blew up the towers with Wiley Code and TNT.
[50:26.000 --> 50:31.000]  And Joan says there's no radical Muslims. And Joan says all these things we didn't say.
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.000]  There is radical Islam. It is trying to attack us.
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  Our government's bringing them into Europe and the U.S., not vetting them.
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.000]  So when they do attack, they'll take our liberties. That's the false flag.
[50:41.000 --> 50:46.000]  Open and shut that you're letting them in. You're letting it happen.
[50:46.000 --> 50:52.000]  Just like in Europe declaring civil emergency and banning free speech after they allow these attacks to take place.
[50:52.000 --> 50:57.000]  It's 2 plus 2 equals 4. It is cause and effect. They have the motive. They have the means.
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  They have the history. They've been caught doing it.
[50:59.000 --> 51:05.000]  Now, members of the Senate, members of the House, they've gone public and they say, okay, it's admitted.
[51:05.000 --> 51:12.000]  Well, of course it's admitted. The FBI, for all its issues,
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.000]  you know, I used to get tricked into just bashing different government agencies for no reason.
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  Just as if that was the enemy, that was the problem.
[51:17.000 --> 51:23.000]  That's where I realized, wait a minute, over all these years, it was the FBI in seven states tried to stop the attacks,
[51:23.000 --> 51:28.000]  knew who it was, and was blocked from doing it in order to stand down, and then agents were demoted.
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  They were buying into just bashing them wholesale.
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  It's like bashing cops, cause one cop does something.
[51:32.000 --> 51:38.000]  It's just mind control. It's much of George Soros' baloney.
[51:38.000 --> 51:41.000]  Doesn't mean the government's not completely corrupt and out of control at the top.
[51:41.000 --> 51:44.000]  Absolutely. Should it be reformed? Absolutely.
[51:44.000 --> 51:49.000]  But Americans need to come together and fix this country and not fight with each other over race
[51:49.000 --> 51:53.000]  and whether you work for the government or don't work for the government.
[51:53.000 --> 51:56.000]  Most people I talk to, whether they work for the government or work in private industry,
[51:56.000 --> 52:00.000]  know this country's in trouble and want to save this country.
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  I mean, we're in trouble, folks.
[52:02.000 --> 52:05.000]  The amount of evil out in the open is mind blowing.
[52:05.000 --> 52:08.000]  Look at these articles. New York Daily News.
[52:08.000 --> 52:11.000]  Royal scum is the headline.
[52:11.000 --> 52:15.000]  Saudis threatened.
[52:15.000 --> 52:22.000]  Asset dump. You blame for 9-11 showdown.
[52:22.000 --> 52:26.000]  700-plus billion they're going to pull out of the U.S.
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  Well, why are they running our country anyways?
[52:28.000 --> 52:31.000]  And Fox News is partly on, I mean, give me a break, folks.
[52:31.000 --> 52:34.000]  Saudi Arabia uses international terrorism.
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.000]  They've invaded Syria. They're behind ISIS and al-Qaeda.
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  It's their proxy army. It's on record.
[52:39.000 --> 52:42.000]  Secret 28-page is under scrutiny ahead of Obama trip.
[52:42.000 --> 52:47.000]  We need regime change there. Hey, you want to threaten us?
[52:47.000 --> 52:50.000]  With your tottering dictatorship over there?
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  With Korea.
[52:52.000 --> 52:55.000]  Secret 28-page is under scrutiny ahead of Obama trip to Saudi Arabia.
[52:55.000 --> 52:59.000]  Now USA covered up Saudi Arabia role.
[52:59.000 --> 53:03.000]  Oh, how the U.S. covered it up. How the U.S. covered it up.
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  How the U.S. covered it up. That's in the New York Times.
[53:05.000 --> 53:09.000]  That's in Bloomberg. That is everywhere now.
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.000]  That is in the news. That is in the New York Post.
[53:12.000 --> 53:16.000]  What are you going to do, bad boys, bad boys, when they come for you?
[53:16.000 --> 53:19.000]  Let me tell you why this feels good.
[53:19.000 --> 53:24.000]  I will defy death. I will do things that are risky if I have to do it first.
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  And I'm so sick of sitting around and seeing nobody else do it,
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.000]  and I got to hit the bar bar first, but I'm ready for other people to hit the bar bar.
[53:30.000 --> 53:35.000]  I'm ready for other people to take the risk and be part of history as well.
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.000]  I have a responsibility when I know something tells the truth.
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  It doesn't mean that I like the consequences.
[53:41.000 --> 53:45.000]  You think I like saying about all that advertising money and all those stations?
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  When they took me off all those stations?
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  You think I liked the death threats?
[53:49.000 --> 53:52.000]  You think I liked all the other dirty tricks I had to go through?
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  The character assassination operations?
[53:54.000 --> 53:58.000]  Not just for mainstream media, but armies of trolls, armies of stalkers,
[53:58.000 --> 54:02.000]  stuff I could write best-selling novels on.
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.000]  But it had to be a novel to protect the innocent.
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  But you know, it's all exciting. It's the animating contest.
[54:09.000 --> 54:13.000]  The persecution is kind of fun. It's interesting.
[54:13.000 --> 54:17.000]  It becomes, let's just say my life's not boring.
[54:17.000 --> 54:20.000]  So I'll tell you, I know that I'm the first to expose 9-11.
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  Two months before it happened, I said they're going to blow up the World Trade Center,
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.000]  blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[54:24.000 --> 54:27.000]  The day it happened, I exposed the whole thing, the drills, all of it,
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  had all the big whistleblowers on, had the deputy have emergency management on.
[54:30.000 --> 54:33.000]  It was dead two weeks after he was on the show, Barry Jennings.
[54:33.000 --> 54:38.000]  I mean, you know, I'm proud of the fact that, you know what? I'm a man.
[54:38.000 --> 54:42.000]  I'm proud of the fact that I don't cower in fear.
[54:42.000 --> 54:45.000]  I'm proud of the fact that I told the truth.
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  I'm proud of the fact that it's all come out.
[54:47.000 --> 54:50.000]  And more and more and more is going to come out.
[54:50.000 --> 54:54.000]  And people look at me and say, you're a weirdo because you think voters should vote in the election.
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  And I'm just like, okay, whatever.
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.000]  Hey, says, fluoride gives you brain damage. Harvard study.
[55:00.000 --> 55:04.000]  You want to point at me and call me a cook because I got hundreds of studies? Okay, whatever.
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  The truth is, I know what I'm talking about.
[55:06.000 --> 55:09.000]  A bunch of dumb, unintellectual people who are uninformed
[55:09.000 --> 55:15.000]  want to have the proper accent, the proper outfit and act trendy and wear all black or whatever they do.
[55:15.000 --> 55:21.000]  Or, you know what trendies do and or have the beard likes the funny guy from the hangover.
[55:21.000 --> 55:26.000]  If you were smart and had the beard like the beard, like the guy from the hangover, then you'd be cool.
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  Not against beards or tattoos.
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  I'm just sick of people that are all hat and no cattle.
[55:32.000 --> 55:38.000]  We're going to come back and get into the other news, the massive chilling attack on free speech happening everywhere.
[55:38.000 --> 55:42.000]  This is so incredible. Wait till we get to this because they can't win debates with us.
[55:42.000 --> 55:47.000]  They've got to shut us down. But 9-11 truth is coming out, being proven right, being vindicated.
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.000]  All of you that stood up for 9-11 truth, you're vindicated.
[55:50.000 --> 55:58.000]  All of you that got attacked for speaking out about it, you are just as important as I am or more important to all the whistleblowers.
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.000]  Everybody in the government that told the truth and went through hell to do it.
[56:01.000 --> 56:08.000]  It's the Sebel Edmonds and the FBI agents and the count and the VISA people and all of them, the thousands of whistleblowers that got persecuted.
[56:08.000 --> 56:14.000]  Good job for standing up for humanity. We salute you.
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.000]  When I tell you how satisfying it is to tell the truth, be proven right and be vindicated, it's not for my ego.
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.000]  It's for other people to know historically the truth will come out in the end.

[59:09.000 --> 59:12.000]  because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[59:12.000 --> 59:17.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[59:17.000 --> 59:23.000]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.

[59:38.000 --> 59:39.000]  10% off on auto ship.

[59:43.000 --> 59:48.000]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[59:48.000 --> 59:59.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:59.000 --> 01:00:07.000]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  All right, I would normally be taking on the calls on the Sunday broadcast, but I've got Rob Duge running us from DFW airport to fly back to Austin.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  He just connected in from Denver.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  Denver was where they were a few days ago from Portland and before that, New York.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  So he'll be popping in about the bedlam, the insanity, the censorship, the attempts to attack free speech and the successful attacks in some cases.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  In New York, in Denver and particularly in Portland.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  So that's coming up.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  And then Richard Reeves pops in 33 after at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  But I do need to dovetail all of this with chilling German Chancellor Merkel, Merkel, like Erkel agrees to charge citizen for anti Muslim poem.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  But it wasn't it criticized the dictator basically is at stage elections of Turkey.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  But look, look, look, we have free speech in Europe and the United States.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  But they don't now if it's against the leftist communist weirdo group controlled corporation radical Muslims.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  It's crazy.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  And they bring them in and say, we can't let them attack us.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  You have no free speech.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  Do whatever they say.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  What's going on?
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  Someone breaking that down.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  Bernie Sanders, liberal supporters.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  Do they expect safe places everywhere?
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  And the Seattle Post Intelligencer.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  Also the New York Daily News also has an article, but this Italian Dershowitz, who by the way said, I shouldn't have free speech.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  Basically, it's strange enough.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  I shouldn't be able to have guns either.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  Said I was dangerous just because I was yelling.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  I'm seeing in right after I was on appears more of that side issue.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  Even he gets it.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  And so it was in AP, but it was in the New York Daily News and also the Seattle Post Intelligencer.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  That's why I said I'm like plugging in three places because it was like three places.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  But it's an AP article or a New York Daily News article.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  They got put in the Seattle Post Intelligencer, whatever.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  Didn't know they did that.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  Bernie Sanders, liberal supporters.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  Do they expect safe places everywhere?
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  Safe spaces.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  And then it goes on to admit that they basically attack people all over the place that don't go along with their views.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  And that's what we've experienced.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  Also, three states ban travel to Mississippi, but they don't ban travel to all these different Muslim countries where they kill gay people.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  And they're all use politically correct term.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  Whatever.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  It's not that it's like people that I want to use the word heterosexual, homosexual.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  It's that it's another thing.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  We'll use the word gay.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  Now use the word disabled, not handicapped.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  And soon it's don't use the word mother and father.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  See, they get you in the habit of using, use this word.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  It's less hurtful or it's more loving.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  And then now we're going to arrest you if we don't use the word we say.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  Well, you know what?
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  It makes me want to use the N word and the F word and all these other words just because you say ban them.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  Or only certain groups can use them.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  It's just all bullying is what it is in the freest western countries in the world where you've been allowed to do all this and get taxpayer paid for sex changes.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  You want to now pull down the family and the free market and the engine of everything that gave you what you've got stupid.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  And then of course, the cherry on top Cirque du Soleil cancels North Carolina shows of Republic Facilities Act because it doesn't have a transgendered bathroom.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  Planned shows in Dubai where gays are put to death.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  That's in Reuters even gets the hypocrisy.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  When I saw that, I'm like, that's Reuters.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  This is a Reuters photo.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  It's Breitbart.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  But I mean, this is just absolutely getting crazy at this point.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  And Facebook censoring people that are pro-Trump and they argue they have all these news articles going, it's good.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  They're censoring Zuckerberg owns it.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  Shareholders own it.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  They're allowed to.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  It's their property.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  But you hold it out as your own little commons and your place for your views and your place to communicate.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  It's false advertising when you do that.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  You hold it out as a place where as long as you don't violate these terms and conditions, we'll let you say whatever you want.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  But now they've changed them to disagreeing with someone or hurting their feelings.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  And then you can selectively decide what to do with your little AI computers.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  They're also censoring stuff about Saudi Arabia 9-11.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  They're censoring all sorts of Benghazi stuff.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  I mean, people like, well, why are you on Facebook then?
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  I go to Facebook to have that platform, to push people to my platform.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  While I warn people, we may not be able to be there that long or YouTube or anywhere else.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  Because let me tell you, they're doing everything they can to kick us off right now.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  888-253-3139
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:10.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  We're going to Rob Do and our crew stranded in Dallas, Texas.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  I come to you from Austin, Texas.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  These are the horrible thunderstorms that canceled flights.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  He just flew back in from Denver and New York and Portland.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  That was where they were traveling.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  The last port of call would be Portland.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  Just showing the social justice warriors trying to ban everybody's free speech across the country.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  And then they've got the RNC stopping popular elections, which they've had previously.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  They say it's no big deal now that they're just giving all the delegates to Ted Cruz.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  But then if he wins Tennessee or wins Louisiana or wins Georgia or wins Arizona,
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  they still just give the votes to Ted Cruz.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  And they say there's nothing to see here.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  Nothing's happening. No big deal.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  And I was thinking about back when I lived by the lake.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  And there were neighbors who had some family members that worked at the University of Texas.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  And we were out on the community dock.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  And I was just thinking of political parties. This is like five years ago.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  And there was this UT, she wasn't a professor.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  I think she was a, what do they call those when you're just like a teacher?
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  Point is, I'm out there fishing with my son at like 7 a.m. in the morning and she walks over.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  And she goes, we're here with gypsies.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  You don't have a problem with gypsies, do you?
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  And I'm like, gypsies?
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  And I'm like, Esmerelda from The Hunchback Another Day?
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  And I'm like, no, you mean Romanoff people?
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  Oh, so you know about it.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  You know how it's all a lie that they do anything and rob anybody that ain't wrong.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  And I'm like, look, lady, I know there's some reform gypsy grips,
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  but also there's Irish pikes that rob people.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  I mean, oh, really?
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  I was like, look, look, I'm sure they're nice.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  And I'm like, what's going on?
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  Well, we're just got some gypsies here.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  And we're having a cultural exchange with them from UT.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  And they're very wonderful people.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  Great, great. I'm sure they're drinking coffee and eating a honey bun, literally.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  My son's trying to catch a catfish.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  He's like, you know, seven years old at the time.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  He's like 13 now.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  And he's got a birthmark.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  Everybody's seen videos of the Rex reports.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  He's not as big as Gorbachev's or anything, but you know,
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  it's a handsome little stork's bite, as they call him.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  They're on the side of his temple.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  And then she turns, she goes, and she looks at me.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  She goes, did someone hurt you, young man?
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  Are you okay? Did someone hit you? What happened?
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  I'm sorry to ask, I just have to answer.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  She looks at me and I'm like, she goes, it's my birthmark.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  And I can tell you how many times I've had a weird, trendy white woman walk over to a restaurant
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  and say to my son, even if he's three, four years old, did someone hurt you?
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  And then I knew it.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  I was like, hey, let's go over here and fish.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  And man, she was around three days.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  I was like, hey, let's go back in and just literally on my butt to keep me in line.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  And that was kind of my first big run in.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  I told you about Halloween last year.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  It's my cousin's birthday.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  I go on this cruise with him.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  He, you know, got a paddle boat on Lake Austin, the river.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  And it's called Lake Austin, but it's really Colorado River.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  And then we went back over to a club.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  He had the top rented out, but it was still open to the public.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  I had multiple people come over because I was wearing a captain's hat.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  I guess I'm a white guy with somewhat blonde hair and asked me, are you a Nazi?
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  And I'd say, no, it's a captain's hat.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  I turned back.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  Hey, because I don't like Nazis.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  I'd say, hey, you're looking for trouble.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  I'm not a Nazi, but you want to trouble your little social justice.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  Worry about to get it.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  A little control freak.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  You want power.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  You're an insecure weirdo that's been taught by the universities how to go out with, with, with, with,
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  with what's the proper term, assertiveness training and get in white male space.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  Well, guess what?
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  You're in one's face.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  It was white women, Arab guys, you name it.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  And it's just like, look, you're looking for trouble.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  You want some simulated combat with your words and your worthless degree.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  You got, you can't get a job with, but you learned how to brainwash people and learned how to obsess over words.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  And I are here messing with me.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  And that's what's going on.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  I just prefaced this segment.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  The next is they're about to get out of the airport.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  I'm going to go quick to them so they can come back and put a big compilation of the 3040 50.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  I don't know how many videos there are.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  They shot in New York, Denver, and out in Portland, Oregon, where they were just announcing Trump supporters on the streets.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  You will be attacked.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  You have no free speech.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  We played the videos last week.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  So our crew went out there.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  Hundreds of info warriors showed up.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  Particularly there in the Portland, because that was our deal.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  Our crew were speakers, Joe Biggs and Rob do it.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  They stood up against being spent on and attacked having bottles thrown at them and faculty trying to shut down their free speech.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  But they did it in America.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  You have to fight for that or lose it.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  But I'm telling you, you got a freak.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  Look at your kid going, did someone hit you and looking at the dad going, I'm sorry.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  I have to ask like she's some FBI agent caught me in something.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  I'm sitting there trying to catch fish with my son at 730 in the morning.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  This is the whacked out world they're in, man.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  You got to understand it's all they got.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  They don't know language, literature.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  They're not intellectual.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  They know how to dominate and mess with people.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  And I've got stacks of articles we're going to get into showing it.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  You criticize Turkey or the Turkish government in Germany.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  You're arrested.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  You criticize radical Muslims in France.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  You're arrested.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  This is where they're going.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  I mean, I was in Rome last year and I saw gypsies robbing people.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  You can go to YouTube and type in their thousands of videos.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  But I've got to be henpecked how they're not robbing anybody.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  Well, these people probably were nice folks.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  Fine.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  They were Americanized.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  That's great.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  The point is I'm not here to have guilt over you.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  I didn't do anything to you.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  You freaks.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  I'm successful in my own world.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  Social justice warriors.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  I don't need to go around jacking with everybody, henpecking everyone.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  Police won't hand stolen caravan back to a couple to protect human rights and travelers living in it.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  See, it's a gypsy culture to steal your travel wagon.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  That's what they call it in England.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  And so you're allowed to keep stolen RVs there.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  Sorry, just a sad point.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  Look at those white people.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  They deserve to have their life savings, their retirement home stolen.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  I mean, you know, screw them.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  I agree.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  I'm a social justice warrior.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  So just breaking down what you faced in New York, in Denver, and then in Portland.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  Break it down.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  What was the worst?
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  What was the best?
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  What are some of the most amazing moments?
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  The videos people should go look at on info wars.com Rob do from the airport.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  Well, I was just informed by the police here that we don't have a permit so we can't be talking to you right now.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  What I'm doing is obviously an illegal act of communication.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  But they can video tape you and let jihadis into the country.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  Right.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  Exactly.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  So I was just informed by the cop.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  Our plane's been delayed till 9 p.m.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  You know, we're renting a three city tour, starting off in Manhattan, going to, going from Manhattan to Denver, then to Portland.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  I know you're super tired.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  You barely got sleep doing this.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  So yeah, the cops over here talking about pigs right now.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  It's kind of funny.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  Why don't we, listen, I don't want to get a confrontation with him.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  Look, they're going to take his pension fund.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  The country's gone.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  Everybody knows it.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  And we can't have slaves with the camera in there without a quote permit inside of the quote, supposed public space where they can all surveil us.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  But, but we can't do an interview in there.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  I told him it was just on Skype.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  So he's like, you don't have a permit to film here.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  But regardless, you know, seeing the light and dark of humanity on this trip has been really interesting.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  We saw, you know, paid, paid organized protesters going after Donald Trump in Manhattan.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  And then we went to Denver to watch some pissed off Americans who are just want their right to vote.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  That's all they want.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  That's all they're asking for.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  Now, wait a minute.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  You're claiming people used to vote.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  That's a known conspiracy theory hate crime that hurts delegates' feelings.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  Delegates are pretty, are in the news saying they feel powerful now.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  People may start actually paying to be delegates.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  It's a new royalty, dude.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  Well, yeah, I think that's what is going to end up happening.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  You're going to see people pay for the privilege of getting to vote.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  And, you know, it just boggles the mind.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  And then yesterday we ended in Portland with the pro-Trump rally.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  And I don't know if you've watched all the Facebook video and other videos that we put up,
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  but it really is interesting.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  These people have no interest in dialoguing or even talking.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  They're beating on buckets, blowing on whistles, just, you know, cussing people out.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  They threw some ice on a kid, like an icy thing hit him.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  They had some of the pro-Trump people had to do a citizen's arrest.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  But then the cops let the guy go.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  And he was obviously intoxicated.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  And he said, we have it on tape saying somebody told me to do it.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  It's just crazy.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  But it was good to see a lot of people came out from different locations,
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  from Idaho, to Washington state, to California.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  I don't want you to run afoul of the police.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  I'm sure you went and sat over there in the corner or something.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  They wouldn't care.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  The citizens don't like to see a fellow slave with a video camera.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  That upsets them.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  Only government can body scan our naked bodies.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  Get a rent car, come back to Austin, or stay till nine.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  I think they're going to keep canceling the plane, dude.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  So just try to call us from the road.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  If I was you, I'd just get out of there.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  We're going to come back with more of the news.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products,
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  we use decades old scientific research to put together the Rolls Royce
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  of all-in-one cleansing.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000]  Look, there's a reason deep cleanse is the only product on the market
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  that uses our proprietary SpyJurex herbal processing technique.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  And we still bring it to you at the best price out there.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  If you wish to find deep cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing,
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  visit infowarslife.com. That's infowarslife.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  Anthony Gucciardi here with an InfoWars Health News Update with Alex Jones.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  That's right, Anthony. One of our top selling products is BrainForce.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  It is very affordably priced at retail that we normally discount it.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  We've discounted from the discount 25%,
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  but if you count it from its regular price, that's 45% discount
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  for a limited time at infowarslife.com.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  There are a lot of BrainBoosters out there, or what's known as Neutropics.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  But here's what separates BrainForce from the rest.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  Unlike some energy drinks and supplements,
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  BrainForce uses natural brain activation ingredients,
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  like Yerba mate extract, alpha GPC, L-theanine, hyperzine A,
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  phosphatidylserine, B12, and many others.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  Major nutraceutical review sites rave about this formulation,
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  and they also rave about the price.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000]  Secure your BrainForce today at infowarslife.com
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  at 25% off retail, 25% off the regular sales price on BrainForce
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  for a limited time at infowarslife.com
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  Good, brother.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  I just recently started using your products.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them,
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation,
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots,
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  a big amount of money there.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs,
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  harvested around the planet,
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  and then concentrated, or maximum potency.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  They want to stun and dumb down,
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while,
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  but then burn you out in my experience,
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  goes right to the source.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  So, it's pretty exciting, and I love it.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  Visit infowarsalife.com today
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  to secure your super male vitality
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000]  and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  Uh, yeah, first of all, I want to say,
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  big for 12, that's two, super male,
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  brain force, prostagart, silver bullet.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  I use them all. They're phenomenal.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  They work. Buy them, folks.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  Thank you, brother.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  I am a relatively short-time listener,
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  Welcome to the InfoWars.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  that support your health and the InfoWars at the same time.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  I buy all the nutraceuticals,
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  Casio FX, Mason I-9.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  All right, let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  What products are you taking? Are you taking?
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  I'm super male, to brain force, to winter sun, X2.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  Even got a little DNA force.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  So when I just re-upped everything,
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  and I just went to Autofill.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  and to see the reviews for yourselves.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:09.000]  At infowarslife.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's InfoWars.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  You know, I'm really glad that Niko and Dari and others just reminded me.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  I mentioned this last hour. I said, coming up,
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000]  I'm going to get into it. One time, Bill Clinton told the truth.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  I'm going to do that right now, and then get back into the news.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  I had a Richard Reeves joining us.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  I could have pushed into the Dallas airport with Dew there,
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000]  but Dew looks so exhausted.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  Because he planned this trip. I was like,
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:55.000]  you're going to be in New York on Thursday, Denver on Friday, Colorado,
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  and then Portland, Oregon on Saturday back Sunday.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  I said, okay, if you want, if the crew wants to do it,
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  you guys knock yourselves out.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  But the videos they've got, I mean, some of them are just comic gold.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  When you hear how stupid these Hillary and Bernie supporters are.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  But I shouldn't laugh at them. They're dangerous, folks.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  Their ignorance is very, very dangerous.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  But getting back to Bill Clinton,
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  Bill Clinton helped give us the current housing bubble and derivative scam.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  That's what he helped get passed.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  Bill Clinton came after our guns. He did so much more.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.000]  By the way, Hillary's back on the news wanting a 25% tax on firearms purchases.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  But Bill Clinton said something that was actually true.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  He's been bashing Black Lives Matter lately,
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  pointing out that they're connected to violence and things.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.000]  But he's also been coming out trying to act like they're more populist
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.000]  and pointed out that some Bernie Sanders supporters would like
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  to basically shoot folks randomly on Wall Street.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  That's a good point.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  It's the big mega banks that run the insider crony deals.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  And then the rest of Wall Street, the rest of free market gets blamed
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  when it's Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and a few others
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  that are actually financing the big government and the control
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  and the domestication of the people to make us dependent.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000]  And then they scapegoat capitalism.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  But to hear Bill Clinton actually tell the truth about Bernie Sanders supporters,
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  because I know Roger Stone says that Hillary is hiring Bernie Sanders people
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000]  who are so ignorant they don't know that when move on.org and others
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000]  who are really supporting Hillary bust them somewhere to shut down free speech,
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  but that gives Sanders a bad name.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  And maybe that's true.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  But most of the people we've had try to come up and say,
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  you don't have free speech are wearing Bernie Sanders shirts.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000]  And man, you got a communist and that's what socialism always turns into.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  Hugo Chavez said he wasn't a communist and admitted he was for he died.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  They play this game.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  Socialism always leads to communism.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.000]  This is another form of totalitarianism, anism.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000]  These people really just want a free ride.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  And they think they're so intellectual.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  It's really frightening.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  But mainstream media demonized me when I said that Bernie Sanders
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  would want to put Americans in forced labor camps.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:29.000]  I don't know a communist government that doesn't do that as it begins to fail.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  Bill Clinton Sanders backers would shoot every third person on Wall Street.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  If Bernie Sanders were elected president,
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000]  his supporters would shoot every third person on Wall Street.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  Former president Bill Clinton joked Friday,
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  stomping for his wife Hillary Clinton at an event in Fort Washington, New York.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  Clinton jabbed Sanders and students who supported the Vermont Senators attacks
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  on corrupt financial systems.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  One of the few things I really haven't enjoyed about this primary quote name is,
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  I think it's fine that all these young students have been so enthusiastic for their opponent.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  And he sounds so good.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:13.000]  Just shoot every third person on Wall Street and everything will be fine, he said.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  Obama, when he was down in Argentina a few weeks ago, said,
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  Communism and capitalism aren't that different, they need to work together.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  Multinationally you need capitalism, but locally you need communism.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  George Soros is above the law tax exempt out here.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  And you're in a slave pit, in a slave factory,
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  under communism with a general that lives in a giant palace and has 15 mistresses
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  and houses all over the United States and Europe.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  It's always the same.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  But it doesn't matter, Bernie Sanders supporters wear black shirts with a shot of his head with curly hair.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  Like, look, he's smart, he doesn't care about his hair.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  Oh, to Walmart, they have hundreds of billions of dollars I'm going to give it to you.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  He doesn't tell you Walmart made deals in the 80s with the CIA and the Chinese Communists
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  to have select deals when nobody could compete.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  Or they run all sorts of other monopolistic schemes.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  He doesn't come out against monopolies.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  He's the capital, capitalism.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  Look, I'm an old guy from a reminder how to job.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  Yeah, he's a lot of money.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  I'm going to give it to you.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  I saw this guy when I was jogging on the green belt today with his Bernie shirt on.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  He thought he was so smart.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  This old guy, he kind of had a haircut like him.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  And then I saw his car when I went back up.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  I could tell it was his car. I'm guessing it's his car.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  And it said, I love Obamacare.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  I almost took a picture, but I was so tired of doing it.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  And then next to it, Bernie Sanders, 2016.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  Because now you fall for me.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  You're going to get the free healthcare like you got under Obama.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  Oh, I'm sorry. You didn't get that.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  You got increased prices. I'm sorry.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  And I've talked to big hospital chain owners and people.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  I got, I know, I'm, I'm friends.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  I've been to a few parties on a few boats.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  I mean, I can say I'm acquaintances with people that, you know,
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  fly to work in a helicopter.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  And they just go, it's so immoral.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  Yeah, we're making double triple profits, but it's all the small places are getting shut down
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  in medium size and city owned hospitals and county owned ones.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  They have no idea it's big multinationals and we're making double triple profit.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  So he goes, you know, I can buy 15 Ferraris this month if I wanted to.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  Yeah, it's so immoral, but it's legal.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  I've just got to do it. Alex, you're absolutely right.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  I'm talking about, well, my dad got out of the, you know,
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  management of over a hundred clinics because he wouldn't be part of this.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  And he's like, well, yeah, no, that's one way to go.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  But, you know, things are going to be so corrupt, it's all going to collapse.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  You just got to go ahead and get yours now.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  You know, my dad wouldn't be part of that.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  He was, he wanted to make a small profit in a free market and deliver high quality
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  of people and he couldn't do that in the system.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  He'd have to go lobby and he parts all these deals and my dad just said,
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  I'm retiring about three years early at the peak of his career.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  Not just as a medical practitioner, not just as an old surgeon,
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  a dentist, but as a manager.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  As well as one of the top, you know, managers in this field in the country,
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  I'd say top 10, consulting all over the world, all over the country.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  And he said, I just can't be part of this.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  But you know what, there's a lot of folks that are going to be part of it
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  and they're going to take all those little Bernie supporters who think
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  if they'd never had a job, can't tie their shoelaces, but they've got hair sticking out.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  And just, you know, it's all about, oh, I'm wearing different colored socks.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  I watch the hangover part three, nine times.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  And they're all about restricting free speech.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  They're all about shutting down people's free speech.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  They're all about, and then you actually talk to the controllers and they go,
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  listen, Alex, we agree with you, this is super immoral and evil.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  I'm telling you, you ought to just join us for a while.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  It's just to protect your family because I'm looking at,
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  I don't know where I'm going to move.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  Where do you think it's safe for me to get out of here?
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  You're talking to some guy who works like a billion dollars.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  And they're like, I mean, you meet another billionaire.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  I mean, these are real billionaires.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  And they're just like, hey, listen, we're actually not against you.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  We agree with you.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  What do we do when the system's, it's designed to screw everything over
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  and take everything over and it's going to crash.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  It's going to be horrible.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  What do we do, Alex?
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  I'm like, I don't know.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  All I tried to do was analyze it and tell the public,
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  but they're too busy watching TV and acted cool and put non-Bernie shirts
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  and, you know, going and mom's going to get a second mortgage
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  to put Billy to get his second degree.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  He couldn't get a job with the first one, but Billy's 25 now
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  and mommy's mortgaging the house.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  Our son's going to get two degrees.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  He'll get three.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  He's going to be a doctor.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  Try being a doctor when everything collapses
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  and it's the road with people running around eating you in the streets.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  You can't survive without it.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000]  But where do you get it?
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  that is like no other.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  into clean, healthy drinking water,
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  with a hybrochromatic shell.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  It removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  This infectance, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  Stainless fuel construction.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  Easy assembly.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  Low maintenance.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  Replacement filters are simple to install.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  And now, as part of an exclusive limited-time introductory offer,

[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.000]  Recall, 888-253-3139.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  We drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000]  to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.000]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of Survival Shield,
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  Nathan Iodine, that major brands and major companies
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000]  have been knocking down our doors to get our formula,
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000]  and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:54.000]  It is exclusive to infowarstlife.com
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:23.000]  and the infowarstlife family of incredible products.
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000]  888-253-3139.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:58.000]  Hey, everyone!
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000]  Farm Suspend Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side,
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000]  and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:12.000]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country,
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000]  obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge,
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000]  and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.000]  If you are dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity,
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials

[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000]  On the web at infowarstime.com.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000]  That's infowarstime.com.
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000]  We are on the march.
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:22.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:27.000]  Richard Reeves for months and months has been following the Trump campaign,
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  the Cruz campaign, the Hillary campaign, the Sanders campaign.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  Following video reports every single day on the nightly news,
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  almost every day, every few days on the radio slash TV transmission
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  that we're hosting the Sunday edition of right now.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  And let me just remind everybody, it takes a lot of money to have three reporters
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  and two camera people in New York, Denver, and then in Portland in the last five days.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  And then to have Richard out there roving with the rest of the great crew,
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000]  it's expensive.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  And to have the writers, the researchers, the crew behind the scenes
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  that are just as important as anybody out there.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  They're like the folks at Cape Canaveral or Houston for the space missions to the astronauts.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  We need folks to go to InfoWarsStore, that's infowarsstore.com
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  and whether it's a Hillary for prison shirt or a Molan Labe come and take it shirt
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  or 25% off the already discounted price on the best new tropic out there,
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  Brain Force or DNA Force or X2 or Silver Bullet colloidal silver or lung cleanse
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.000]  or the oxy powder, you name it.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  I was just talking to a fellow today whose wife, everybody's getting these bowel disorders
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  because of all the GMO and all the garbage.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  And for about six months, she started taking oxy powder every few weeks.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  And guess what?
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  Her inflammation is gone.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  She's better.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  I'm not saying it's a panacea for anybody, but it's just higher level oxygen
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  that releases in the upper and lower intestine and really cleans everything out.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  Some stuff sold out like anthroplex.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  But the joint formula that's just, well, what is it?
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  Nine of the best known organic compounds to help with your joints and inflammation
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  and to help the joints basically continue to be healthy or to, well, it does a lot.

[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  Again, is the umbrella site for all of that.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  And your purchases make the broadcast possible.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  Now, I want to go to our reporter, again, who's pulled over, Skyping in,
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  Richard Reeves, somewhere in Pennsylvania on his way to Buffalo, New York,
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  to cover the big Trump primary that he's set to sweep.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  But we've got a major problem here.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  Whether you love Trump or hate Trump, I like him because he's a nationalist
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  and against China and others having unfair trade deals.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  It's very, very simple why the Chinese president and the Chinese official communist
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  papers are calling him Hitler when they have mobile execution vans
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  killing their political dissidents.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  It's because if they have a 35 to 40% tariff, it varies.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  It's always going up and down on a daily basis, set by the Communist Party against us.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  We can't compete in China.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  Plus, no environmental standards, no human rights.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  I mean, you just can't compete with China because it's rigged.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  And Trump says that's going to stop.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  And he's given money to anti-nafty and anti-gap initiative.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  He's spoken out against it for 25 years.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  That's why they hate him.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  He's got some problems, but he's a nationalist.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  He's a real person.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  They've got his number.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  They're scared.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  And you've got the Saudi Arabian government on the Human Rights Commission,
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  others coming out saying no Donald Trump.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  You've got all this other censorship.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  You've got the Pope and the Mexican president, the former Mexican president,
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  telling you as a citizen, bullying you, you can't have Donald Trump.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  And now in Tennessee, in Georgia, in Arizona,
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  in all these other states, Louisiana,
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  he wins by 10, 20 points.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  They just take the delegates and Ted Cruz wins.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  And then Ted Cruz, last week in Colorado, this weekend in Wyoming.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  Here's the headline, Cruz wins another voterless contest in Wyoming
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  and has the nerve to call it, quote, a grassroots uprising.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  Man, I got to tell you, Richard never liked Ted Cruz,
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  and he's been heavily involved in Texas politics forever.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  Since I met him 14 years ago, he's a delegate, you name it.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  He used to go to the RNC DNC with me many years ago.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  So Richard's an old hand at this.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  He predicted all this happening 10 months ago on air, got Roger Stone on.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  But I got to tell you, Richard, I'm really amazed at how naked and brazen they are.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  And it really freaks me out.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  I mean, I wonder what's next.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  The big banks are getting ready to do bail ins, grab part of our bank accounts.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  I mean, this really shows how far down the rat hole we've got.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  So you've got a lot to break here today.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  A whole cornucopia of issues that you want to break down
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  some of the inside Republican baseball you've been getting
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  when you've been in all these big meetings and at these events
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  and Stone and others helping you get behind the scenes.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  Now they're calling for Stone to be banned everywhere.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  They're claiming we're calling for violence.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  Well, the truth is they're the ones intimidating free speech everywhere.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  Richard Reeves from beautiful, looks like a roadside park there in Pennsylvania.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  That's right, Alex. Thank you very much.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  That is Interstate 80, one of the lifelines of this country.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  There's so much freight, so much trucking that goes across that.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  When I was a truck driver back in the 80s and 90s, unbelievable amount.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  That's the aorta of the United States right there, right along with I-95, I-35.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  But anyway, that's not what we're here to talk about.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  Basically, this is like that scene in The Wizard of Oz
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  when you, Alex Jones, Toto, pull back the curtain
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  and the wizard is back there feverishly flipping levers, hitting buttons.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  Don't look at the man behind the curtain.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  And that's why they're acting the way they're acting.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  I mean, they are really pulling out all the stops.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  And one of the reasons you were talking about, you know,
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  they hate Donald Trump for all these different reasons.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  And one of those is because I think the issue of 9-11 Truth
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  prior to this election season was kind of like one of those Wiley Coyote road runner cartoons
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  where Wiley Coyote is running up and he's about to go off a cliff,
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  but he puts the brakes on, he's sliding right to the edge,
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  and he comes to the edge and he's got one toe left on the edge of that cliff
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  and he's just perfectly balanced and he can potentially keep himself from falling off.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  And Donald Trump comes up and just a little puff
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  and the Wiley Coyote 9-11 Truth going off the cliff in a big way.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  That's right. For those that don't know, it's all over the news.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  Mainstream news saying our government stood down on 9-11,
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  bare minimum allowed Saudi Arabia to attack.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  And obviously there's more to it, but when this comes out, it is huge.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  It is huge, Alex. This is not going away.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  I don't think this time on at least probably three of the big Sunday talking head shows,
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  this issue came up and I think on every one of the 9-11
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  or every one of the big Sunday talking head shows,
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  this story about Saudi Arabia potentially threatening to take $750 billion worth of investment in the United States.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  Talk about, are we worried about invasion? Hey, invasion has happened if they would have $750 billion worth of assets.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  We're being held hostage by a third-generation dictatorship who literally ran a white slave trade
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  kidnapping women on the trade routes.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  I mean, that's who the Saudi Roll family is, is the literal scum of the earth, slavers.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  Right. And just think about this, that they would make this threat.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  Oh, we're going to pull out our $750 billion worth of investment if you guys pass this legislation
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  that 9-11 families can sue governments.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  Well, I tell you what, you know, just about everywhere I know of in the United States,
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  a jury and a judge would say, hey, that sounds kind of like an admission of guilt to me, Alex.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  Sounds like terrorism to me. We're about to go to break.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  You've got a bunch of other points you're going to cover when we come back.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  Some of it breaking news on the campaign. Tell us what's coming up.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  Well, one of the things that's coming up is, you know, they've amped up the Hillary Bernie horse race
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  that Bernie lost this race a long time ago, the super delegates.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  We talked about that way back in January.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  I think they're just amping it up to try to take some of the focus
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  and some of the energy out of the Donald Trump campaign.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  But, you know, it just seems like...
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  And the big one, Paul Ryan, you're going to hear it here first,
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  is listed on FCC documents or Federal Elections Commission documents
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  as the candidate getting ready to run for L Presidente with no votes.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  They'll just give it to him and he'll say no one ever voted.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  Well, does that conspiracy theorist Alex Jones or Matt Grudge telling you you vote?
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  There was never votes in America.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  Hollywood actor Robert De Niro doubled down on his desire to scream the controversial documentary Vaxxed,
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  concerning vaccines, saying that he is not anti-vaccine.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  He just wants safe vaccines.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:13.000]  I'm concerned and I want to know the truth and I'm not anti-vaccine.
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  I want safe vaccines.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  The actor recently discussed the film on The Today Show.
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.000]  I think the movie is something that people should see.
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  There was a backlash which I haven't fully explored and I will,
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  but I didn't want to start affecting the festival in ways I couldn't see.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  But definitely, there's something to that movie.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  And there's another movie called Trace Amount, the actor said.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  I, as a parent of a child who has autism, am concerned and I want to know the truth
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  and I'm not anti-vaccine.
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  I want safe vaccines.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:50.000]  De Niro goes on to say that he may possibly become part of the vaccine autism discussion
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  following the film's fallout.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.000]  Anthony Gucciardi here with an infowars health news update with Alex Jones.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.000]  That's right, Anthony.
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:06.000]  One of our top selling products is BrainForce.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000]  It is very affordably priced at retail that we normally discount it.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  We've discounted from the discount 25 percent,
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  but if you count it from its regular price, that's 45 percent discount
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  for a limited time at infowarsteam.com.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  There are a lot of brain boosters out there or what's known as new tropics,
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  but here's what separates BrainForce from the rest.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  Unlike some energy drinks and supplements,
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  BrainForce uses natural brain activation ingredients,
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  like guerba mate extract, alpha GPC,
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  L-theanine, hyperzine A, phosphatidylserine, B12, and many others.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  Other nutraceutical review sites rave about this formulation,
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  and they also rave about the price.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.000]  Secure your BrainForce today at infowarsteam.com
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000]  and get 45 percent off retail,

[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  I was listening to that liner, three or four years old.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  And it was like when you go over a big hill in a car
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  and your heart drops.
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  I was like, we are the heart of the Resistance.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  We're in trouble. We're about the best there is.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  I'm on the opposite of a power trip, folks.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  I'm running around here like a chicken with my head cut off
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  meets Paul Revere.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  Just saying, look, folks, they got hundreds of farms
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  across the United States growing humanoids inside cows.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  People say, so what's the point?
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  And I was talking to my lawyer last week and he said,
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  yeah, my intern, my paralegal brought this up to me.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  You're talking about humans growing in cows.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  What's this craziness?
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  So I showed him a news article.
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  I texted him. I was talking to him on the phone.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  He goes, wow, that's an MIT.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  And I went, yeah, man.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000]  Yeah, there's a lot of crazy stuff going on.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  And we got to get a handle on this.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  It's out of control.
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  I interviewed the FBI agents that were ordered to stand down
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  before 9-11.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  I interviewed the NSA people that heard the calls.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  I've interviewed the colonels that were ordered to stand down.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  I've interviewed everybody, basically,
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  because I was the only one crazy enough to have whistleblowers on.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  The fact that I'm alive really is a marvel.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  I told the story many times about my dad's first cousin.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  He called him his uncle because he was 10 years older than him.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  He died a few years ago.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  He just marveled that I wasn't dead because that was the job he had,
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  was going out and getting rid of people here in the United States for the Army.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  I mean, the public just needs to grow up, okay,
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  and realize that we have an arrogant, out-of-control government that thinks it's God.
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  And it's not God.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  And I mentioned this earlier,
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  so I should play the clip where folks will say it doesn't exist.
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  It's Bill Clinton has his truth moment.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  Bill Clinton Sanders backers would shoot every third person on Wall Street.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  That's actually a true statement.
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  They're a bunch of evil people wearing Sanders shirts with red flags,
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  with hammers and sickles saying they're not communists,
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  beating people up in wheelchairs.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  I even saw that in New York.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  And they can't even fight.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  People sit there and let them hit them.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  They swing their fists from the side like a four-year-old child would do.
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  I mean, what are they going to do if they hit me and I, like, break their nose?
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  I mean, and if I want to be mean, I'll aim up.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  I mean, what are you going to do when you get punched by a real American?
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  You're going to sue me and then I'll have to go to court to show that you hit me first.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  I mean, I don't want to break your nose.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  If you punch me, I'm going to break your nose.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  Maybe I'll just break your jaw.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  It's kind of like a trick, breaking somebody's jaw.
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  It's almost like it's magic.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  You've got to punch full power, totally relaxed, punch around the side and just go,
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  Yeah!
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  And then their jaw breaks most of the time.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  I guarantee you this.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  They go down to the ground.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  Get me an old man.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  That even hurt my shoulder doing that first little explosive move there.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  And it's nothing that I'm special.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  I'm just a throwback.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  I'm the standard model off the shelf 100 years ago.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  You understand that?
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  People need to ask themselves, what have they become?
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  What have people turned into?
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  By the way, people say, oh, you're not tough like you said.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  Hey, whatever.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  I go out without bodyguards, folks.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  What's that tell you right there?
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  Tells you that I'm not living in this cowardly fantasy land.
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  I live in the real world.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  Back to Richard Reeves.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  Richard, you've got the floor till we end this transmission.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  Run through this laundry list.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  You got a bunch of stuff.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  All Ryan gearing up to run saying he won't other important tidbits, Richard Reeves.
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000]  All right, Alex.
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  Thanks.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  Coming out of that bottom of the hour break, you were talking about the Info Warrior support,
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  not only financially, but also their prayers.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  I believe strongly their prayers have protected you for all these years.
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  Who'd have ever thought that when you started this program back in the mid 90s, here we
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  are in 2016.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  We are on the field, folks.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  We are making history.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:56.000]  The reason the New World Order is doing all the ridiculous things that are doing is because
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  the Info Warriors are on the field.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  We are there.
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000]  We are taking them on.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  Look, we've got a front runner that has talked about 9-Eleven Truth and he's the front runner.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  Come on.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:10.000]  So the Info Warriors, their prayers, their financial support, we're going to bring Liberty and
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  Freedom, not just back into the United States, but we're going to bring it globally, Alex.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  And that's what's going to happen.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  We are.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  You got a laundry list of stuff you texted me that was really powerful.
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  You said Niko.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000]  Let me hit this point about Paul Ryan.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  Paul Ryan came out last week and said, no way, no how, I'm running for president.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  Well, it turns out that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have filed statements of organization
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  with the FEC back in 2015, several documents, and the latest documents that have been filed
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  with the FEC.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  Wait a minute.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000]  You mean they lie?
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  They lie?
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  Next you're going to tell them that we used to have elections.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  Well, he told the truth that you weren't going to run for president, but he didn't say anything
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  about not running for VP.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  So he's already made a deal with Mitt Romney, if they had to parachute somebody in, it's
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  going to be Mitt and Paul Ryan.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  Who were on the ticket together four years ago?
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  That's right.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  They were on the ticket together four years ago.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  I guess they spooned and got along well four years ago, so they're going to try to do it
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  again.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  But here's my thing, Alex, is the establishment, one of their gambits is going into Cleveland.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  One of their gambits is they've always had a giant establishment majority in these conventions
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  at the RNC every four years.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  They're counting on trying to have that again, but I got news for them.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  I think we're going to have an anti-establishment majority of 60 to 70 percent.
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  I was about to say, even Politico has an article about all these white collar and even wealthy
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  liberals that are sick of deindustrializing America, all these Reagan Democrats, basically
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  good liberals that are liberal socially but don't want to destroy the country.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  And the polls show blacks, you name it, massively go into Trump.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:50.000]  I mean, look how many Hispanics he's been getting in different states in the primaries.
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  That's why they're having to steal it.
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  They're panicking.
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  Everybody knows he's not Hitler.
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  What do you think of the Communist Chinese generals calling him Hitler?
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  When these people are the closest thing to Hitler I've seen?
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:05.000]  Well, you know, all these international leaders are just pulling their hair out because they're
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  worried about Donald Trump cutting off their big financial gravy train with manufacturing,
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000]  with jobs, with just-
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  They've hijacked the country, sold America out, and they can't even believe he would dare
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  think about stopping it.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  Well, they're used to having pallets of cash dropped on their countries out of C-130s,
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  and they're facing that that might get stopped and that somebody might actually care about
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  the American people as a nationalist like Donald Trump.
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.000]  So these international leaders, yeah, they're wetting their pants or quaking in their boots,
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  whatever you want to call, whatever cliche you want to use to say that, hey, they're
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  really wide-eyed.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  I know this.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  What else is coming up?
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  What are the ramifications of Colorado?
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  You pointed out that Hillary's totally won and stolen it.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  That's a total distraction, horse race.
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  What else is going on?
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  Well, and when Bernie is not the nominee, I think a lot of those Bernie voters are going
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  to come to Trump in the general if we can get Trump through the nominations process
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  and make him the nominee.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  Now, one big thing I think is going to happen is, you know, this nine letter truth thing
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.000]  coming out.
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  It may play a big role in the RNC in Cleveland.
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  I think this could be the issue that actually wins Trump.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  Let's say Trump doesn't get his 1237, which 1237 may change because of Colorado.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  Let's talk about Colorado for a second.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  Colorado, I think it's going to be the Alamo.
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  I think it's going to be, and I think that for Ted Cruz, he's going to be on the Mexican
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  side of the Alamo.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  I think for Trump, he's going to be on the Texan side of the Alamo in Colorado.
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  I think this is just reinvigorated, re-energized, kickstarted again the Donald Trump train.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  So I think Trump will end up getting very, very close to the 1237.
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  I think there's going to be big challenges on the Colorado delegation.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  We're going to see challenges on Texas delegation.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  We may see that 1237 actually come down if delegations are not seated.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  So that's another thing to watch out for.
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  Then looking forward into Cleveland, I think what may happen is this 9-11 issue.
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  All right.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  Ted Cruz has his issues, but his supporters are constitutionalists.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  Ted Cruz's supporters love the Constitution.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  They're patriotic.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  They're just not fully on board with 9-11 Truth.
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  Not completely, but I would say 25, 30% of Ted Cruz's support are 9-11 Truthers.
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  This last push here started last Sunday by 60 minutes.
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  I totally agree.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  I totally agree.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  And are we not totally vindicated as 9-11 Truthers?
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  They've always misrepresented us to say we don't believe this radical is long.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  We're the ones exposing it that there's an alliance at the highest level of the globalist operation with them.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  And as that comes out, I tell you, it's really hurting the New World Order.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  I totally agree with you.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  And again, it's Donald Trump helping take us over the edge in this march down the 100 yards to the goal line.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  We are a half yard in and we've got two or three downs to get in, folks.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  It is ours to lose this fight.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  In closing, Richard, what's coming up in Buffalo?
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  What's coming up in New York?
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  How big is the landslide for Trump?
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  Well, the landslide is going to be good here.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  The GOP is fractured.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  The GOP is not homogenous.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  Yeah, they did well in Wisconsin.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  They're doing good in Wyoming, Colorado, and some of these other states.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  But the GOP is not homogenous.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  They're breaking probably about 15% is breaking towards Trump.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  Cruz has got a little bit of a case that has, I don't know.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000]  So they're having trouble stealing.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  He's looking at maybe a 60% victory in New York.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  I think it's going to be approaching 60%.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  And let me say right now, prediction, I think 9-11 is going to play a key role in Cleveland.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  If Trump can't win the first vote from the delegates,
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  I think he talks about 9-11 of truth coming up.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  That's right.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  And that's why they're scared.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  They know he's getting ready.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  Don't give it all away, Richard.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  It's the battle for the Republican.
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:56.000]  You're all part of it.
