[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:36.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.000 --> 00:40.800]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you for joining us today this 30th
[00:40.800 --> 00:46.960]  day of September 2009 on this Wednesday edition we're going to get updates from
[00:46.960 --> 00:53.000]  Montana with the quote American police force the shadowy foreign organization
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.440]  that won't even tell local news or the governor of Montana or the state
[00:57.440 --> 01:03.600]  legislature who funds them where they come from and what they're doing another
[01:03.600 --> 01:14.120]  shadowy development is that this $27 million prison internment facility was
[01:14.120 --> 01:20.320]  built in the last two years now they're expanding it with unnamed millions of
[01:20.320 --> 01:27.520]  dollars of expansion and yesterday and last night no exaggeration I watch three
[01:27.520 --> 01:33.560]  or four CNN pieces more than 10 Montana pieces from different TV stations
[01:33.560 --> 01:39.920]  over the last a year speculating about what the camp is and now they just admit
[01:39.920 --> 01:47.680]  it is being designated as a Guantanamo Bay facility for terrorists and then I
[01:47.680 --> 01:53.160]  went and pulled up other articles from earlier this year where Obama even when
[01:53.160 --> 01:56.760]  he was president-elect before he was sworn in in January was saying that they
[01:56.760 --> 02:01.520]  would probably move the prisoners to camps inside the US and also keep US
[02:01.520 --> 02:05.840]  terrorists there I pulled up a another report admitting that they're already at
[02:05.840 --> 02:10.400]  a former super max in Montana keeping animal rights activists and other
[02:10.400 --> 02:17.960]  people and that their families quote can't visit them so very very very
[02:17.960 --> 02:23.360]  bizarre and then you add to that this shadowy American police force will not
[02:23.360 --> 02:28.360]  answer questions to media national or local they will not say where their
[02:28.360 --> 02:32.880]  funding's coming from they will not say why they showed up in black SUVs a week
[02:32.880 --> 02:39.240]  ago with the name of the Montana town on the side of the vehicle saying that
[02:39.240 --> 02:44.840]  they were the new police force so we're gonna go over some of those clips today
[02:44.840 --> 02:50.360]  and break that down get an update from folks in Montana on that then in the
[02:50.360 --> 02:58.480]  third hour we have Ray McGovern former top CIA analyst to Ronald Reagan and
[02:58.480 --> 03:04.360]  George Bush senior an expert on Iran will get his take on the hype that's
[03:04.360 --> 03:08.760]  taking place and the calls for military strikes on that country different
[03:08.760 --> 03:14.600]  international bodies the United Nations UN Security Council and others meeting
[03:14.600 --> 03:18.960]  today into the next few days quote deciding what to do they're already
[03:18.960 --> 03:24.680]  basically agreed on very hard sanctions against Iran and this is a giant hoax on
[03:24.680 --> 03:30.640]  its face I ran two weeks ago announced that they were getting ready in the next
[03:30.640 --> 03:35.800]  few months to complete another uranium enrichment facility and the media
[03:35.800 --> 03:40.760]  engaged in a massive hoax saying oh my gosh we caught them red-handed we found
[03:40.760 --> 03:45.160]  a secret nuke base with a bombs basically and then a few days later they
[03:45.160 --> 03:49.680]  said oh we mean they announced it and told us where it was but sneakily and
[03:49.680 --> 03:57.280]  they they're in trouble and and and they may nuke us and so it's just part two of
[03:57.280 --> 04:03.840]  Iraq total and complete lies but the lie is so bold and so over the top some
[04:03.840 --> 04:07.720]  people are being suckered again and again and again as P.T. Bartam said a
[04:07.720 --> 04:13.000]  sucker is born every minute a sucker is born every second nowadays but the
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.440]  population means so much so much larger on this planet these are the same
[04:17.440 --> 04:24.280]  people that lie to the public on every front and so we'll be breaking that down
[04:24.280 --> 04:29.200]  today as well but I know that a lot of you from Montana and surrounding areas
[04:29.200 --> 04:33.440]  want to comment on the old National Guard bases being turned into makeshift
[04:33.440 --> 04:38.720]  prisons and quote local county fusion centers federalizing your local police I
[04:38.720 --> 04:43.600]  want to open the phones up to talk about the economy the FEMA camps
[04:43.600 --> 04:48.240]  Obama's plunging approval ratings all these new fake terror alerts they're
[04:48.240 --> 04:58.300]  issuing 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air stay

[08:00.560 --> 08:19.080]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:19.080 --> 08:25.280]  It is Wednesday 30th day of September 2009. I want to thank all of you for
[08:25.280 --> 08:29.120]  joining us today. We're gonna be taking phone calls throughout the entire
[08:29.120 --> 08:33.960]  broadcast. Sandy, WC, Steve, Dave, Patrick, everybody we're gonna be going to you
[08:33.960 --> 08:38.960]  here in just a few minutes. You know they're telling us that we have a jobless
[08:38.960 --> 08:44.360]  recovery now here in the United States because they're measuring the economy
[08:44.360 --> 08:50.320]  off of how the financial system is doing and since 23.7 trillion again that
[08:50.320 --> 08:54.240]  number is now two months old every two months or so so they're do out anytime.
[08:54.240 --> 08:57.760]  The Federal Reserve tells us oh we've taken this much money now but we won't
[08:57.760 --> 09:02.140]  tell you where it went. It was probably over 28 trillion judging on the trend
[09:02.140 --> 09:07.080]  chart but we know it's 23.7 trillion over 50 trillion worldwide and so because
[09:07.080 --> 09:12.800]  they have engorged themselves on 20 plus trillion here in the US and 50 trillion
[09:12.800 --> 09:19.240]  total worldwide they say the economy is doing absolutely wonderful as the tent
[09:19.240 --> 09:24.320]  cities pop up and as people lose their jobs or get put on part time or go off
[09:24.320 --> 09:30.640]  the unemployment rolls and on average we have been losing several hundred
[09:30.640 --> 09:40.480]  thousand jobs a month. Employers cut 254,000 jobs in September so far larger
[09:40.480 --> 09:46.640]  than expected CNBC reports. US private employers cut a larger than expected
[09:46.640 --> 09:54.160]  254,000 jobs in September though this was less than the revised 277,000
[09:54.160 --> 09:59.640]  jobs lost in August a report by a private employment service said on
[09:59.640 --> 10:07.800]  Wednesday. Also they are reporting record loss in manufacturing jobs and
[10:07.800 --> 10:12.720]  overall manufacturing capacity in the United States but guess what sector grew
[10:12.720 --> 10:19.480]  at a record clip in the last month the government they are hiring and raising
[10:19.480 --> 10:24.640]  lots of new taxes and squeezing the slaves as people scurry around trying
[10:24.640 --> 10:31.560]  to make ends meet and as the stock market continues to drop today. Also finally
[10:31.560 --> 10:35.880]  mainstream media I saw CNN this morning reporting in reports on health care
[10:35.880 --> 10:39.680]  workers refusing to take the force inoculations in New York state and
[10:39.680 --> 10:44.640]  protesting in multiple cities from Albany to New York City in New York
[10:44.640 --> 10:50.480]  yesterday but CNN said well they just don't want to be made to take it first
[10:50.480 --> 10:54.480]  but but see here's the issue Obama saying nobody has to take this though
[10:54.480 --> 10:58.640]  they're announcing that they're forcing with no law police departments fire
[10:58.640 --> 11:03.840]  departments medical workers across the country to take shots and there is a
[11:03.840 --> 11:10.720]  another announcement today on the flu front military to get mandatory swine
[11:10.720 --> 11:15.120]  flu shots soon this out of the Associated Press US military troops will
[11:15.120 --> 11:19.000]  begin getting required swine flu shots in the next week to 10 days with active
[11:19.000 --> 11:23.240]  duty forces deploying to war zones other critical areas along the front to the
[11:23.240 --> 11:28.520]  vaccine line a top military commander said Tuesday but multiple major and this
[11:28.520 --> 11:32.280]  is in my stack when I cover it later after calls major newspapers in Canada
[11:32.280 --> 11:41.680]  report the government is showing that their studies are indicating that the
[11:41.680 --> 11:47.760]  swine flu shot in trials in Canada in the last month and a half is actually
[11:47.760 --> 11:52.440]  causing outbreaks of the flu so again Canadian newspapers reporting that
[11:52.440 --> 11:57.040]  government studies show that the swine flu shots are actually spreading it well
[11:57.040 --> 12:03.200]  of course what a genius plan I'm also going to get into the latest developments
[12:03.200 --> 12:08.480]  in hardened Montana with the shadowy group American police force telling the
[12:08.480 --> 12:12.640]  governor and the legislature now the governor and legislature have weighed
[12:12.640 --> 12:20.040]  in on Billings television and other TV stations in Montana of all places the
[12:20.040 --> 12:26.840]  newspapers in California are reporting on what's happening as well the
[12:26.840 --> 12:32.160]  San Jose Mercury news is a reporting and also quoting us saying oh right-wing
[12:32.160 --> 12:39.120]  talk show host Alex Jones says that they've got local hardened police
[12:39.120 --> 12:44.000]  department decals on American police force the private contracting mercenary
[12:44.000 --> 12:50.320]  firms cars Alex Jones is scaring people saying this I know it's on the
[12:50.320 --> 12:58.200]  Billings TV it's on the little bighorn and hardened TV channel it's in the
[12:58.200 --> 13:03.880]  Billings Gazette but this is what the mainstream media will do nationally like
[13:03.880 --> 13:09.800]  Fox News repeatedly has said Alex Jones says there's been deaths in Europe from
[13:09.800 --> 13:16.120]  different flu vaccine trials this year no Bloomberg and the London Telegraph say
[13:16.120 --> 13:22.000]  that Alex Jones says they've got contracts for mass graves in Indiana
[13:22.000 --> 13:28.960]  and New York and other states no the Department of Cemetery's in New York
[13:28.960 --> 13:32.880]  document and others say that and now it's become mainstream news other
[13:32.880 --> 13:38.880]  newspapers report months ago Alex Jones says that we're already under a UN level
[13:38.880 --> 13:42.960]  6 threat back when they were telling the public we were at level 4 and then it
[13:42.960 --> 13:47.000]  came out later that we were indeed under that no I posted the secret document I
[13:47.000 --> 13:51.320]  got from a state official here in Austin that gave it into my hand with the
[13:51.320 --> 13:55.200]  names of the state board and the doctors meeting with the feds in April and
[13:55.200 --> 14:01.240]  I'm not tuning my horn here it's just that 95% of the time when I cover
[14:01.240 --> 14:05.200]  something it's already from a document or from the news or from my witness
[14:05.200 --> 14:10.280]  reports that can be confirmed 5% of the time I speculate and I openly say we
[14:10.280 --> 14:18.120]  are speculating when we speculate but it's just very very frustrating along
[14:18.120 --> 14:21.920]  the line of martial law preparations across the country we've seen
[14:21.920 --> 14:26.200]  Schenectady New York mayor say oh we want martial law in the town we don't
[14:26.200 --> 14:28.560]  have enough police even though they've tripled the number of their police the
[14:28.560 --> 14:31.680]  last 12 years in that town following the national average the same as the
[14:31.680 --> 14:37.080]  national average and we saw Birmingham Alabama a month ago say oh we may ask to
[14:37.080 --> 14:42.000]  put troops on the streets of Birmingham because we've got a shortage of police
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.320]  another lie they've got record police that was in the local paper there and I
[14:46.320 --> 14:50.640]  see these reports every couple days now remember about eight months ago before
[14:50.640 --> 14:55.080]  Blagojevich got in real trouble he went out and gave a press conference and said
[14:55.080 --> 14:59.280]  we're gonna use the National Guard and gun confiscation door-to-door statewide
[14:59.280 --> 15:03.960]  and I played the press conference here on air and people wrote articles about
[15:03.960 --> 15:07.280]  me saying Alex says the governor's getting ready for gun confiscation
[15:07.280 --> 15:11.960]  door-to-door or Alex says the Chicago police have announced they're gonna
[15:11.960 --> 15:16.440]  shoot you if you flee in a car or on foot in the back no that was CBS News
[15:16.440 --> 15:25.860]  Chicago well this latest report is from PR inside this is a press release put
[15:25.860 --> 15:31.320]  out by Andy Martin Andy Martin says emergency measures are needed to stem
[15:31.320 --> 15:36.160]  the tide of islands in Chicago US Senate candidate Andy Martin calls for the
[15:36.160 --> 15:41.120]  imposition of martial law in Chicago this is his press release this is not
[15:41.120 --> 15:46.920]  me saying this this is the mayor of Schenactady this is the city council of
[15:46.920 --> 15:52.000]  Birmingham this is what's happening in Tennessee and in Texas and in Arizona
[15:52.000 --> 16:01.480]  and in Kentucky and you can go to this PR press release by him Andy for us
[16:01.480 --> 16:08.920]  senator calm why don't you go read it from him office Senate website it makes
[16:08.920 --> 16:14.720]  my head spin and then I've got all these articles every day I Google the term
[16:14.720 --> 16:18.760]  New World Order thousands of new articles per day now not not per week per
[16:18.760 --> 16:22.320]  day thousands of new ones calling for world government world taxes in the end
[16:22.320 --> 16:27.040]  of the dollar here's the Washington Times dollars days of dominance may end
[16:27.040 --> 16:30.840]  that's the type of news I have in my stack but I want to go to your calls
[16:30.840 --> 16:34.960]  from people being forced to take the flu shot or your husbands are wise being
[16:34.960 --> 16:39.760]  forced it being pushed on your children many schools around the country and have
[16:39.760 --> 16:44.720]  a stack of news on that are saying you know what you want to come to school you

[16:50.280 --> 16:55.880]  shot Obama says three shots they say well maybe just two or maybe three and
[16:55.880 --> 17:00.600]  then there's no law they just say we're gonna kick you out of school if you
[17:00.600 --> 17:04.520]  don't take the shot through policy and then we're gonna charge you with
[17:04.520 --> 17:10.120]  truancy and that's how criminal charges then are brought into effect and kick
[17:10.120 --> 17:15.560]  in so just absolute color of law and fraud and racketeering going on it is
[17:15.560 --> 17:19.120]  wall-to-wall so I want to hear from you on that I want to hear from folks in

[24:26.380 --> 24:38.580]  I'll take my chances on you, again and again, again, coming straight on to the New World
[24:38.580 --> 24:39.580]  Order.
[24:39.580 --> 24:45.980]  I've had a chance to read the whole Globe World Exclusive Obama's Secret Enemies list,
[24:45.980 --> 24:49.580]  reveal 25 names who President wants to silence and why.
[24:49.580 --> 24:51.660]  Bill Clinton reportedly running the operation.
[24:51.660 --> 24:53.820]  I believe this is somewhat of an accurate report.
[24:53.820 --> 24:54.820]  I'll tell you why.
[24:54.820 --> 25:01.860]  I'll give you some of the background on that coming up when we start the next hour.
[25:01.860 --> 25:06.940]  We've also got some of the witnesses coming on to the police riots of the G-20, some of
[25:06.940 --> 25:10.460]  the people that were arrested, some of the court cases that are already being heard yesterday
[25:10.460 --> 25:16.420]  and today, and some of the witnesses to the police dressed up like anarchists out causing
[25:16.420 --> 25:20.100]  problems smashing people's cameras.
[25:20.100 --> 25:24.380]  Of course, I've got the anarchist then emailing me saying, how dare you say we're police?
[25:24.380 --> 25:26.820]  These were obviously big police doing this.
[25:26.820 --> 25:27.820]  We caught them in Denver.
[25:27.820 --> 25:28.820]  They admit they did it.
[25:28.820 --> 25:29.820]  We caught them in Canada.
[25:29.820 --> 25:31.980]  I mean, this is mainline news.
[25:31.980 --> 25:37.340]  It's not saying all anarchists are doing this or all anarchists are cops, but that's what
[25:37.340 --> 25:38.340]  the anarchists do.
[25:38.340 --> 25:40.100]  They build straw men.
[25:40.100 --> 25:46.820]  They say we've said things that we're not saying, and that's why they're so disingenuous
[25:46.820 --> 25:47.820]  on average.
[25:47.820 --> 25:51.740]  They're not saying there aren't reasonable, real anarchists out there that aren't doing
[25:51.740 --> 25:56.820]  these things, but all the big anarchist sites are calling for violence and calling for disruptions.
[25:56.820 --> 26:00.180]  That only feeds into the police operation.
[26:00.180 --> 26:05.740]  So I'm sure there are some real idiots out there causing problems and that want anarchy
[26:05.740 --> 26:10.260]  and society that only helps the globalist and their motto, order out of chaos.
[26:10.260 --> 26:11.260]  Let's go back to Sandy.
[26:11.260 --> 26:13.540]  Sandy, what was your point about being out in the country?
[26:13.540 --> 26:18.500]  Well, like I said, I live out in the country, and my husband and I, we used to farm and
[26:18.500 --> 26:22.100]  ranch and had a little farm and, you know, a little ranch.
[26:22.100 --> 26:23.100]  And we quit that.
[26:23.100 --> 26:27.580]  That was back in the 80s because they started shipping all the beef in from Central America,
[26:27.580 --> 26:32.940]  Costa Rica and stuff like that, and the small farmers just could not stay in business.
[26:32.940 --> 26:37.180]  And now they're passing the animal ID, premises ID to fully shut down those that are barely
[26:37.180 --> 26:38.180]  holding on.
[26:38.180 --> 26:39.180]  Yes.
[26:39.180 --> 26:40.180]  That's right.
[26:40.180 --> 26:46.300]  And just a couple of months ago, and these doctors are also involved in, well, not all
[26:46.300 --> 26:51.380]  doctors, but the biggest majority of them is involved in this new World Order II.
[26:51.380 --> 26:58.100]  It was about a month ago, let's see, my husband's type person, he refuses to go to see a doctor,
[26:58.100 --> 27:01.980]  you know, because they gave him something that made him sick.
[27:01.980 --> 27:07.900]  So anyhow, about a month ago, I had protective services come out to my house.
[27:07.900 --> 27:13.380]  And they tried to get, they, well, they gave me a psychology test.
[27:13.380 --> 27:18.580]  Well, man, you shouldn't have even talked to them, man, man, they had no warrant.
[27:18.580 --> 27:22.220]  And then they asked you to be reasonable and talk to them, but they're not reasonable.
[27:22.220 --> 27:26.220]  They're trying to make up a quack report to claim your mentally ill so they can steal
[27:26.220 --> 27:27.220]  your property.
[27:27.220 --> 27:29.700]  These are hardcore criminals.
[27:29.700 --> 27:33.780]  And it's like I said, I couldn't get a lawyer, they wouldn't let me get a lawyer, they had
[27:33.780 --> 27:39.060]  my phone all tied up, I tried to get a hold of you and stuff, and they just kept the phone
[27:39.060 --> 27:40.060]  tied up.
[27:40.060 --> 27:41.060]  So did they grab your husband?
[27:41.060 --> 27:44.180]  No, no, no, they did not.
[27:44.180 --> 27:49.620]  My husband told him, look, I'm not being abused, my wife is not abusing me.
[27:49.620 --> 27:50.620]  And they told me.
[27:50.620 --> 27:53.340]  Well, see, ma'am, ma'am, stay there, Sandy, what they've done is they've run out of kids
[27:53.340 --> 27:55.180]  to snatch over a million a year.
[27:55.180 --> 28:00.580]  So now they're out snatching old people, especially property owners.
[28:00.580 --> 28:03.700]  And just when they show up, don't answer the door, the police can't come in without
[28:03.700 --> 28:04.780]  a warrant.
[28:04.780 --> 28:09.460]  But the CPS or elder services trick you and go, look, just be reasonable, we just want
[28:09.460 --> 28:10.460]  to check on you.
[28:10.460 --> 28:12.700]  Then they come in and say, you're beating your husband.
[28:12.700 --> 28:17.180]  Oh, look, he's got a spot on his arm as if old people don't, you know, all start having
[28:17.180 --> 28:18.180]  that.
[28:18.180 --> 28:22.460]  And then they, or he falls down and bruises himself or an old folks slip and fall.
[28:22.460 --> 28:23.540]  And then they come grab him.
[28:23.540 --> 28:26.460]  Have you seen the cover of Newsweek, the case for killing granny?
[28:26.460 --> 28:30.020]  They just want to get their clutches on him, pump him full of morphine, kill him dead,
[28:30.020 --> 28:34.140]  and a hammer at a hospice, and then they could come in and get your property and move into
[28:34.140 --> 28:35.140]  it.
[28:35.140 --> 28:36.140]  Right.
[28:36.140 --> 28:40.860]  And it likes that they told me that if I did not cooperate with them, that I'll be
[28:40.860 --> 28:42.900]  labeled as a terrorist.
[28:42.900 --> 28:43.900]  So the skunk.
[28:43.900 --> 28:44.900]  Okay.
[28:44.900 --> 28:45.900]  Where do these, where do you live?
[28:45.900 --> 28:47.940]  And who are these scumbag filth?
[28:47.940 --> 28:52.860]  Well, they, they, from the Texas protective service, what they was found.
[28:52.860 --> 28:56.980]  And I tried, of course, I guess I raised my voice at them, but you know, they just feed
[28:56.980 --> 28:57.980]  on you.
[28:57.980 --> 29:01.260]  You know, I tell you, I'm so sick of this trash.
[29:01.260 --> 29:05.860]  I've seen them feed on old folks here in Austin, nothing but wolves.
[29:05.860 --> 29:11.660]  Listen, do you have any family in the area because, well, I can't exactly tell you that
[29:11.660 --> 29:16.260]  on the phone because I live a sort of a private life.
[29:16.260 --> 29:17.980]  I understand, ma'am.
[29:17.980 --> 29:24.340]  And I have to worry about mine and my house security because I'm, I'm watching my, well
[29:24.340 --> 29:26.220]  ma'am, tell me how it ended.
[29:26.220 --> 29:28.540]  Tell me how it ended with the filth.
[29:28.540 --> 29:29.540]  Tell me how it ended with them.
[29:29.540 --> 29:33.420]  Well, anyhow, it, they wanted to come in my house.
[29:33.420 --> 29:34.420]  I did not let them.
[29:34.420 --> 29:39.420]  I have a little shop out there since a little old resell shop.
[29:39.420 --> 29:43.820]  I let them come out there and that's when the guy gave me the psychology test.
[29:43.820 --> 29:46.220]  He said, he said, you are a terrorist.
[29:46.220 --> 29:47.220]  Yeah.
[29:47.220 --> 29:50.900]  They said, stay there, ma'ams.
[29:50.900 --> 29:52.180]  We're on the march.
[29:52.180 --> 29:54.620]  The empire's on the run.
[29:54.620 --> 29:58.380]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:58.380 --> 30:03.980]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[30:03.980 --> 30:08.320]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[30:08.320 --> 30:09.320]  do you want?
[30:09.320 --> 30:14.860]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[30:14.860 --> 30:16.340]  Food is your only ammunition.
[30:16.340 --> 30:17.580]  How much do you want?
[30:17.580 --> 30:18.580]  When do you want it?
[30:18.580 --> 30:21.740]  Now or after the battle starts, when will you need it?
[30:21.740 --> 30:23.860]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[30:23.860 --> 30:25.180]  Will there be any food?
[30:25.180 --> 30:26.660]  Will it make your children sick?
[30:26.660 --> 30:30.780]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[30:30.780 --> 30:31.980]  and be immunized?
[30:31.980 --> 30:35.740]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[30:35.740 --> 30:39.340]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[30:39.340 --> 30:40.580]  How much will you need?
[30:40.580 --> 30:41.580]  We don't know.
[30:41.580 --> 30:42.580]  How much do you want?
[30:42.580 --> 30:43.580]  All you can get.
[30:43.580 --> 30:44.580]  I'm Alex Jones.
[30:44.580 --> 30:47.780]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[30:47.780 --> 30:53.820]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoods.org.
[30:53.820 --> 31:01.260]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[31:01.260 --> 31:07.340]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[31:07.340 --> 31:11.860]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[31:11.860 --> 31:13.180]  us would like to see.
[31:13.180 --> 31:18.340]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[31:18.340 --> 31:19.340]  of the American people.
[31:19.340 --> 31:24.100]  Well, Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[31:24.100 --> 31:29.220]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[31:29.220 --> 31:37.340]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[31:37.340 --> 31:40.900]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[31:40.900 --> 31:47.820]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[33:07.820 --> 33:12.340]  You can't imagine how they're robbing old people, how they're taking their houses and
[33:12.340 --> 33:17.940]  property when I first got started in 1995.
[33:17.940 --> 33:22.580]  That was the first stories I ran into because old folks would see me on TV here locally
[33:22.580 --> 33:27.900]  and call me up and they'd say, I'm getting $2,000 a day fines for three inch grass and
[33:27.900 --> 33:33.020]  they would come out and then put fines on them and then take their property, send police
[33:33.020 --> 33:34.900]  to their houses and arrest them.
[33:34.900 --> 33:39.340]  And then I would go to the city council people's houses and show them with three foot grass
[33:39.340 --> 33:47.020]  in neighborhoods and tarps on their roofs and mosquitoes breeding in buckets of water.
[33:47.020 --> 33:50.700]  Then hundreds and hundreds of old people started calling me and it was always the same MO.
[33:50.700 --> 33:55.260]  They'd have surgery, they'd be visited by a social worker in the hospital, they would
[33:55.260 --> 33:59.180]  then put the order through to the city to start putting fines on their houses to get
[33:59.180 --> 34:00.180]  them.
[34:00.180 --> 34:04.300]  These are hard core criminals and they're operating in every town and city in the country
[34:04.300 --> 34:08.820]  and now it's coming out all over national news, how they'll go out in the country and
[34:08.820 --> 34:13.740]  pass a retroactive rule, no grandfathering saying, yeah, you got a gravel road going
[34:13.740 --> 34:20.940]  to your house off the highway, $1,000, $2,000 a day fines seem to be par for the course.
[34:20.940 --> 34:24.820]  Then when you don't pay it, they take it to county court, take your property.
[34:24.820 --> 34:28.240]  If you don't come off the property, SWAT team shows up and every couple of weeks I hear
[34:28.240 --> 34:33.540]  about an old guy or old woman gunned down inside their house or they tear gas them and
[34:33.540 --> 34:34.540]  get them out.
[34:34.540 --> 34:36.820]  High five properties, theirs.
[34:36.820 --> 34:40.500]  And that's how government rolls.
[34:40.500 --> 34:44.020]  Remember seeing stories last few months, how government officials are moving into repossessed
[34:44.020 --> 34:46.260]  homes in these programs now.
[34:46.260 --> 34:49.820]  I mean, they know what they're doing now, now, now Sandy finishing up.
[34:49.820 --> 34:53.460]  So you had a little shop behind your house and you said you'd meet with them there and
[34:53.460 --> 34:57.660]  then the social worker was also, I guess, a psychologist or claim they were and did
[34:57.660 --> 35:00.980]  a psychological test, you know, you have a fifth amendment.
[35:00.980 --> 35:01.980]  They didn't have a warrant.
[35:01.980 --> 35:04.100]  You don't have to talk to the scum.
[35:04.100 --> 35:11.500]  But when did this, this, this, this Nazi, this Soviet, this commissar, this, this creature,
[35:11.500 --> 35:13.740]  when did he start threatening you saying you're a terrorist?
[35:13.740 --> 35:18.780]  Well, see, they come up here and they said, well, if I didn't talk to him, first of all,
[35:18.780 --> 35:22.020]  the lady came by and she left her card out there.
[35:22.020 --> 35:24.860]  She didn't even knock on the door or nothing.
[35:24.860 --> 35:29.700]  And that was on the 7th or 17th of, of 09.
[35:29.700 --> 35:33.260]  And when I try to get a hold of her, after all, this is over with these people.
[35:33.260 --> 35:36.140]  Don't let me exist anymore.
[35:36.140 --> 35:37.140]  You can't get a hold of them.
[35:37.140 --> 35:39.020]  You can't find out what their names is.
[35:39.020 --> 35:41.020]  You can't, because I called them.
[35:41.020 --> 35:42.020]  Oh yeah.
[35:42.020 --> 35:46.420]  When the CPS was trying to take one of my employees kids, when the CPS was trying to take one of
[35:46.420 --> 35:50.700]  my employees children for literally no reason, it became a big scandal in the local TV and
[35:50.700 --> 35:53.660]  newspapers here in Texas, central Texas.
[35:53.660 --> 35:59.060]  They wouldn't even say their names and they check everybody at gym class for bruises on
[35:59.060 --> 36:02.300]  their knees, bruises anywhere and they try to take them.
[36:02.300 --> 36:06.140]  And they strip, search them and then lie about it and then later have to admit it.
[36:06.140 --> 36:10.380]  And ma'am, you just be, it'd be just be best not to talk to them.
[36:10.380 --> 36:12.500]  They don't have a warrant.
[36:12.500 --> 36:14.460]  It's never good to talk to these criminals.
[36:14.460 --> 36:16.020]  They're just there to meet a quota.
[36:16.020 --> 36:19.220]  They have quotas on children they need to kidnap.
[36:19.220 --> 36:23.380]  The adoption agency is telling them when a blonde-haired blue-eyed two-year-old, they
[36:23.380 --> 36:25.940]  go out and start hunting in the schools for them.
[36:25.940 --> 36:29.380]  So just God bless you ma'am, sorry to, but, but, but, but now the criminals are leaving
[36:29.380 --> 36:30.380]  you alone?
[36:30.380 --> 36:37.340]  Well, as I know of they are, because I like that I have one around and told several people
[36:37.340 --> 36:42.420]  what happened to me, but I got the feeling that they're going to label me as a terrorist
[36:42.420 --> 36:43.420]  because of us.
[36:43.420 --> 36:45.620]  Oh wait, so they didn't say you'd be a terrorist?
[36:45.620 --> 36:48.460]  They, they, they're going to label me as a terrorist.
[36:48.460 --> 36:54.900]  They said the police officer that came out here, at least he said he was a police officer.
[36:54.900 --> 36:55.900]  Oh.
[36:55.900 --> 36:56.900]  And what did he say?
[36:56.900 --> 37:04.740]  Well, he said if I didn't apologize to his dispatcher, that he would arrest me and I'll
[37:04.740 --> 37:10.740]  be labeled as a, right now I'm, I'm a suspect as a terrorist.
[37:10.740 --> 37:12.380]  Oh, he did say that.
[37:12.380 --> 37:13.380]  Yes.
[37:13.380 --> 37:14.380]  Ma'am, don't, don't be scared.
[37:14.380 --> 37:17.780]  You don't have to say your full name or what, but, but, but what county is this?
[37:17.780 --> 37:20.580]  This is in Jasper County.
[37:20.580 --> 37:23.060]  Well, thank you so much ma'am.
[37:23.060 --> 37:24.060]  God bless you.
[37:24.060 --> 37:28.660]  I don't have any other problems.
[37:28.660 --> 37:33.980]  I remember before 9 11, all the training manual saying gun ownership, being a veteran, being
[37:33.980 --> 37:39.060]  a constitutionalist, talking about the constitution, making frequent references to the constitution.
[37:39.060 --> 37:42.140]  These are quotes, by the way, means you're a terrorist.
[37:42.140 --> 37:45.460]  And I kept telling everybody this has nothing to do with Al Qaeda.
[37:45.460 --> 37:50.220]  Then I read the Patriot Act back in October of 2001 when they passed it in the dead of
[37:50.220 --> 37:51.860]  not knowing being able to read it.
[37:51.860 --> 37:56.740]  I read it two days after they passed it when they made it public and section 802 said all
[37:56.740 --> 38:00.740]  misdemeanors or acts of terrorism, no bill of rights, no constitution.
[38:00.740 --> 38:04.140]  Now that's openly admitted and we've played the Senate talking about it and admitting
[38:04.140 --> 38:05.140]  it.
[38:05.140 --> 38:07.660]  And then it's used tens of thousands of times a year per state.
[38:07.660 --> 38:13.740]  No more bill of rights, no more constitution, totally criminal road government.
[38:13.740 --> 38:18.020]  And it is the same thing now with the DHS reports and the myack report.
[38:18.020 --> 38:19.740]  Look, it's all for us.
[38:19.740 --> 38:24.780]  You understand and they're the only part of the country growing industry is police and
[38:24.780 --> 38:30.700]  spies and social workers and title tales and they're recruiting your kids in school publicly.
[38:30.700 --> 38:31.700]  Wait till you see fall.
[38:31.700 --> 38:32.700]  The Republic.
[38:32.700 --> 38:33.700]  It's just unbelievable.
[38:33.700 --> 38:36.260]  It has like a 15 minute segment just on that.
[38:36.260 --> 38:37.980]  Let's talk to WC in Texas.
[38:37.980 --> 38:38.980]  You're on the air.
[38:38.980 --> 38:39.980]  WC.
[38:39.980 --> 38:40.980]  Hey, Alex.
[38:40.980 --> 38:41.980]  Thanks for taking my call.
[38:41.980 --> 38:42.980]  Thanks for calling.
[38:42.980 --> 38:47.900]  I tell you what, these, these older folks out here in our country, I'm so glad they're
[38:47.900 --> 38:51.860]  still alive and kicking because they got more fight and spunk than a lot of these pride
[38:51.860 --> 38:53.900]  cutting men out here who think they're tough.
[38:53.900 --> 38:54.900]  So I'm glad it was that.
[38:54.900 --> 38:55.900]  You're right.
[38:55.900 --> 38:59.580]  All the big tough guys that they show up, they just hand their baby right over and say,
[38:59.580 --> 39:02.900]  have fun raping my child, shooting him up with drugs.
[39:02.900 --> 39:03.900]  And then I'm serious.
[39:03.900 --> 39:04.900]  They just roll over.
[39:04.900 --> 39:08.380]  But when you walk into a grocery store, past one, they'll kind of walk in your way and
[39:08.380 --> 39:09.380]  act tough.
[39:09.380 --> 39:13.500]  They're real tough, but they, they just love rolling over to the government.
[39:13.500 --> 39:14.500]  Don't they?
[39:14.500 --> 39:15.500]  Yeah.
[39:15.500 --> 39:18.860]  They're like, Hey, buddy, you're on a list and kind of just playing a little seed on
[39:18.860 --> 39:19.860]  them.
[39:19.860 --> 39:20.860]  Then they'll crap their pants.
[39:20.860 --> 39:21.860]  Yeah.
[39:21.860 --> 39:22.860]  That's what they ought to.
[39:22.860 --> 39:27.020]  But what I wanted to ask you, sir, because your opinion means a lot to me, I've been
[39:27.020 --> 39:31.820]  speaking with some of these LaRouche people and they're, they should come off as good
[39:31.820 --> 39:35.180]  folks, highly, highly educated.
[39:35.180 --> 39:40.500]  And I got to talking with a few of them about the swine flu vaccine and, and we were talking
[39:40.500 --> 39:45.940]  about Ron Paul and, and other avenues of information that I use because I don't just feed at one
[39:45.940 --> 39:46.940]  water fountain.
[39:46.940 --> 39:50.100]  I've got to go to many and get all the facts that I can.
[39:50.100 --> 39:55.020]  Well, the lady that I was speaking with, again, highly educated and the older ones they refer
[39:55.020 --> 40:01.140]  to as boomers, she told me, she goes, Oh, well, if Lauren doesn't tell you, you don't have
[40:01.140 --> 40:02.140]  to worry about it.
[40:02.140 --> 40:04.940]  And I looked at her almost kind of like, lady, are you serious?
[40:04.940 --> 40:10.460]  I mean, that's very cultish like, and I mentioned your name and another folks name.
[40:10.460 --> 40:12.620]  And it was nails on a chalkboard to a man.
[40:12.620 --> 40:16.540]  I mean, it was like, Oh, don't even mention him, all this stuff.
[40:16.540 --> 40:20.340]  And I'm thinking, cause I'm trying to tell him, Hey, why don't we all combine forces
[40:20.340 --> 40:24.460]  and we can do this, we can establish a Hamiltonian banking system and all this stuff that they
[40:24.460 --> 40:25.460]  talk about.
[40:25.460 --> 40:30.100]  It's just like, well, I called Dr. Stan and asked him and he used the analogy that they're
[40:30.100 --> 40:33.700]  like snake venom 95% of what they say is true.
[40:33.700 --> 40:37.940]  It's just that 5% is what gets you just like 5% of snake venom is what kills you.
[40:37.940 --> 40:45.220]  Listen, I hear you at WC, look, I don't make my show about critiquing all the other little
[40:45.220 --> 40:49.660]  political action groups that are out there.
[40:49.660 --> 40:54.700]  And that's a tip to other radio shows and websites, all they do, half of our energy
[40:54.700 --> 41:00.460]  gets spent critiquing each other and exaggerating things about other groups and attacking other
[41:00.460 --> 41:01.460]  groups of people.
[41:01.460 --> 41:04.020]  And I'm not saying you're doing that WC.
[41:04.020 --> 41:12.060]  It's just that I don't make my show about groups that aren't taken over my life.
[41:12.060 --> 41:17.020]  The federal government is controlled by foreign offshore banks on record.
[41:17.020 --> 41:20.740]  They are bankrupting my country and my children's future.
[41:20.740 --> 41:22.660]  They are setting up FEMA camps.
[41:22.660 --> 41:26.440]  They are setting up face scanning and license plate reading cameras everywhere.
[41:26.440 --> 41:29.620]  They are putting in the naked body scanners and all the major airports that's going in
[41:29.620 --> 41:30.620]  nationwide.
[41:30.620 --> 41:31.620]  214.
[41:31.620 --> 41:33.540]  That's basically all the big airports.
[41:33.540 --> 41:36.900]  Houston just got them.
[41:36.900 --> 41:39.660]  We've got to audit the Fed.
[41:39.660 --> 41:43.820]  We have got to warn people about the Gardasil shot that's killing people and naming people
[41:43.820 --> 41:45.380]  and mass on record.
[41:45.380 --> 41:49.500]  We've got to warn people about the regular seasonal flu shot and all the problems associated
[41:49.500 --> 41:53.020]  with it and the even more dangerous H1N1.
[41:53.020 --> 41:59.660]  Now that said, again, Lenin LaRouge is not taking over my life.
[41:59.660 --> 42:04.620]  Lenin LaRouge is not the one trying to raise my property taxes.
[42:04.620 --> 42:09.900]  That said, their analysis of the British oligarchy and the Anglo-American establishment
[42:09.900 --> 42:17.580]  is stunningly accurate and it's really good research.
[42:17.580 --> 42:22.140]  But then they would do stuff like say Bill Clinton was good when he was in office, but
[42:22.140 --> 42:25.100]  Al Gore was bad when they all work on the same team.
[42:25.100 --> 42:30.420]  And so they do mix in things that they know are patently false in my opinion.
[42:30.420 --> 42:34.820]  Also one time I saw, well, they had an access TV show that was a national show they aired
[42:34.820 --> 42:35.820]  on access in Austin.
[42:35.820 --> 42:39.860]  I think in like 97, I was already on the air at the time for a few years and they said
[42:39.860 --> 42:42.220]  call and get a free intelligence report.
[42:42.220 --> 42:47.340]  So I called the number and I got a really hard sale to give money and to subscribe to
[42:47.340 --> 42:52.860]  it and they kept calling me and really trying pushy cultic tactics on me out of their Houston
[42:52.860 --> 42:53.860]  office.
[42:53.860 --> 42:57.900]  I never really talked to them again other than the fact that they'll call here from
[42:57.900 --> 43:00.700]  the national office and say, do you want to interview Lenin LaRouge?
[43:00.700 --> 43:05.540]  And I go and I say, sure, and they call back and go, well, you got to interview these three
[43:05.540 --> 43:06.540]  people first.
[43:06.540 --> 43:07.900]  And I just say, no, thank you.
[43:07.900 --> 43:11.200]  And they always call back wanting to get on the show.
[43:11.200 --> 43:16.960]  So I don't touch the LaRougeites with a 10 foot pole.
[43:16.960 --> 43:21.620]  That said, answering your question, Webster Tarpley was one of their chief analysts.
[43:21.620 --> 43:24.140]  He is a real political mind.
[43:24.140 --> 43:28.500]  I disagree with some of his conclusions or his solutions, but I agree with his analysis
[43:28.500 --> 43:29.500]  at spot on.
[43:29.500 --> 43:34.540]  And he's shown himself to really have a lot of foresight and really is a versatile historian
[43:34.540 --> 43:37.660]  as a doctorate in history, his PhD.
[43:37.660 --> 43:42.740]  And he has a doctorate in economics, he's very scholarly.
[43:42.740 --> 43:46.740]  He's a what a Fulbright scholar, I believe going from memory one top of his class.
[43:46.740 --> 43:55.100]  But the issue is he left them and he says that it's a messianic cult built around Lenin
[43:55.100 --> 43:57.100]  LaRouge.
[43:57.100 --> 43:59.500]  But again, you asked me the question.
[43:59.500 --> 44:05.020]  I hate to even go there because it is not Lenin LaRouge taken over our lives.
[44:05.020 --> 44:06.540]  You know, that's the same thing about me.
[44:06.540 --> 44:11.580]  I mean, let's just say I'm bad because a lot of people take kernels of truth and build
[44:11.580 --> 44:18.220]  lies on them or more often than not total whole cloth lies about me.
[44:18.220 --> 44:23.740]  And then it becomes this entire subculture and cottage industry of attacking me.
[44:23.740 --> 44:25.500]  And that's fine.
[44:25.500 --> 44:33.140]  As long as people don't waste their time defending me, I desperately want to warn people about
[44:33.140 --> 44:35.620]  not taking the Gardasil shot and the flu shot.
[44:35.620 --> 44:37.340]  They're trying to make all this mandatory.
[44:37.340 --> 44:40.580]  They're trying to set the precedent right now with this H1N1.
[44:40.580 --> 44:44.620]  More than anything, that's what this is, a federal precedent, a UN takeover precedent
[44:44.620 --> 44:47.860]  under world health organization rules.
[44:47.860 --> 44:54.980]  That's what this is really all about.
[44:54.980 --> 44:57.540]  And we are at the cost of major change.
[44:57.540 --> 45:00.260]  We are now inside the new world order.
[45:00.260 --> 45:03.540]  And so people constantly say, what do you think of this person, what do you think of
[45:03.540 --> 45:04.540]  that person?
[45:04.540 --> 45:07.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know that you are good.
[45:07.860 --> 45:09.500]  You know that you care about liberty.
[45:09.500 --> 45:11.220]  You know that you are a leader.
[45:11.220 --> 45:16.980]  So start a website, start a radio show, start a local newspaper, start a local newsletter,
[45:16.980 --> 45:23.980]  whatever, go to city council, speak out on issues, get involved now.
[45:23.980 --> 45:28.300]  We do not have time to screw around.
[45:28.300 --> 45:30.380]  Okay.
[45:30.380 --> 45:34.620]  We do not have time to play games anymore.
[45:34.620 --> 45:37.580]  And the reason I'm on the White House enemies list, we're going to cover some of this next
[45:37.580 --> 45:43.140]  hour is because I have been accurate.
[45:43.140 --> 45:45.660]  I have gotten people motivated.
[45:45.660 --> 45:48.980]  When you ask people that have woken up to the new world order, and a lot of people have
[45:48.980 --> 45:56.940]  done this and Ron Paul has talked about it on air, about eight times out of 10, up until
[45:56.940 --> 46:00.820]  about a year ago, they would say, Alex Jones woke me up.
[46:00.820 --> 46:05.180]  Now it's more like about 60% of the time they say Alex Jones woke me up and about 40% of
[46:05.180 --> 46:07.300]  the time they say Ron Paul did.
[46:07.300 --> 46:08.900]  And that's great.
[46:08.900 --> 46:10.540]  I don't like being the lone ranger.
[46:10.540 --> 46:12.060]  I don't like being the most effective.
[46:12.060 --> 46:13.580]  It's a very dangerous position.
[46:13.580 --> 46:19.020]  I'm happy to walk point a lot of the time, but I need to have other people walk point
[46:19.020 --> 46:22.860]  so that there's just not one target out here.
[46:22.860 --> 46:24.180]  It's an idea.
[46:24.180 --> 46:25.420]  They can get flesh and blood.
[46:25.420 --> 46:32.020]  They can shut me down or kill me or set me up or demonize me, whatever.
[46:32.020 --> 46:39.300]  But the idea of liberty and freedom and standing up against the new world order is invincible,
[46:39.300 --> 46:44.260]  is unstoppable, is transcendent.
[46:44.260 --> 46:51.260]  And so that's why I tell folks when the establishment tries to attack me and others and when they
[46:51.260 --> 46:57.300]  try to attack Ron Paul, when you see the establishment attacking people and when you see them doing
[46:57.300 --> 47:01.820]  it from the biggest media in the country in the world to the lowest level and the alternative
[47:01.820 --> 47:07.180]  media, you have to know that most of that put it this way.
[47:07.180 --> 47:10.660]  The establishment stirs the pot.
[47:10.660 --> 47:14.580]  And then other people join in a snowball effect, a mockingbird effect.
[47:14.580 --> 47:18.380]  A mockingbird will copy a, it's a state bird of Texas, it'll copy a lawnmower, it'll copy
[47:18.380 --> 47:23.100]  a dog barking, it'll copy a baby crying, it'll copy car alarms.
[47:23.100 --> 47:24.540]  And that's what the public does.
[47:24.540 --> 47:28.740]  They know the public is disenfranchised, the public is angry, the public knows they're
[47:28.740 --> 47:30.320]  losing their standard of living.
[47:30.320 --> 47:32.420]  The public knows they're going into tyranny.
[47:32.420 --> 47:34.300]  The public knows they're being lied to.
[47:34.300 --> 47:40.700]  The only hope the establishment have is playing us off against each other, black against white,
[47:40.700 --> 47:45.540]  old against young, racial issues, religious diversions, religious divisions, starting
[47:45.540 --> 47:51.900]  new wars, balkanization, divide and conquer.
[47:51.900 --> 47:55.900]  The great game is the British call it at every level.
[47:55.900 --> 47:59.940]  And so that is our enemy.
[47:59.940 --> 48:05.180]  We need to be focused on the real government, the illegitimate private run for profit Federal
[48:05.180 --> 48:12.420]  Reserve, which is nothing more than the private regional governorship over the power to issue
[48:12.420 --> 48:14.660]  currency and credit.
[48:14.660 --> 48:16.700]  That's the only issue.
[48:16.700 --> 48:18.260]  That's it.
[48:18.260 --> 48:23.900]  When you come to the power structure, you deal with that, you decapitate that politically,
[48:23.900 --> 48:28.780]  you expose that, you bypass, I mean, how ridiculous is it that we spend all day fighting
[48:28.780 --> 48:33.060]  over Obama and Bush and McCain and Sarah Palin?
[48:33.060 --> 48:35.140]  And they use that left, right paradigm.
[48:35.140 --> 48:38.900]  That's their biggest divider all over the world.
[48:38.900 --> 48:43.460]  So that we fight with each other and we're divided out of the gates when both parties
[48:43.460 --> 48:44.660]  are bought and paid for.
[48:44.660 --> 48:48.620]  I know that people can intellectually get that, but can you get that in your gut?
[48:48.620 --> 48:54.540]  I've been beating the drum for 14 years about the left, right paradigm.
[48:54.540 --> 48:58.300]  The left, right culture.
[48:58.300 --> 49:03.140]  The left, right system.
[49:03.140 --> 49:08.060]  The red state, blue state garbage, and they have little differences on the surface and
[49:08.060 --> 49:11.260]  they end the Democrats and Republicans do fight with each other.
[49:11.260 --> 49:17.020]  But it's just like two managers say at IBM at a regional level who work for the same
[49:17.020 --> 49:18.660]  company but fight with each other.
[49:18.660 --> 49:19.660]  Doesn't matter.
[49:19.660 --> 49:20.900]  They work for the same company.
[49:20.900 --> 49:24.100]  And yes, they really hate each other in some cases more often than not, they're intermarried
[49:24.100 --> 49:28.060]  and hang out and, you know, do have fights from time to time.
[49:28.060 --> 49:29.540]  It's just like my office.
[49:29.540 --> 49:33.020]  We got people in my office who probably some of them who don't really like each other,
[49:33.020 --> 49:35.460]  but they still work for me.
[49:35.460 --> 49:38.900]  You understand they overall are taking orders from Alex Jones.
[49:38.900 --> 49:41.460]  Well, it's the same thing with the government.
[49:41.460 --> 49:45.020]  The government's run by the private banks and the Republicans and Democrats may have
[49:45.020 --> 49:49.740]  some differences and struggle over the management positions, but they still work for the private
[49:49.740 --> 49:50.860]  banking shareholders.
[49:50.860 --> 49:55.500]  So we identify them, which is starting to happen.
[49:55.500 --> 49:57.980]  And once that process starts, it's very hard to reverse.
[49:57.980 --> 50:00.020]  They're trying.
[50:00.020 --> 50:04.420]  And so the only way they can attack the Patriot, the Liberty, the anti-New World Order movement,
[50:04.420 --> 50:07.660]  the group that really knows what's going on and needs to be out there educating the
[50:07.660 --> 50:13.100]  general public, who's ready to wake up, who is now receptive to the truth, if they can
[50:13.100 --> 50:16.500]  just get us fighting with each other, and we've caught the government funding groups
[50:16.500 --> 50:20.420]  doing this, it's come out in Congress, and they've targeted myself and others in congressional
[50:20.420 --> 50:21.420]  hearings.
[50:21.420 --> 50:26.340]  I'm now on the White House enemies list for heaven's sakes and the top 25 people.
[50:26.340 --> 50:29.980]  If they can do that, they're going to win.
[50:29.980 --> 50:38.260]  Now, if we're able to get past that and realize this agenda, and if we're able to set aside
[50:38.260 --> 50:44.380]  our petty differences and move forward, overall, I think the LaRouche group does a lot of good.
[50:44.380 --> 50:52.940]  I just think as any old organization, you know, they develop weird, weird, weird behaviors,
[50:52.940 --> 50:54.380]  but side issue on that.
[50:54.380 --> 50:59.260]  The point is, we need to stop infighting with each other and focus on the real power structure.
[50:59.260 --> 51:01.020]  We don't do that, we're dead.
[51:01.020 --> 51:04.260]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[51:04.260 --> 51:08.220]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[51:08.220 --> 51:13.140]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride, at less than 2 cents per

[52:11.940 --> 52:15.860]  What their objective being world domination?
[52:15.860 --> 52:19.020]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[52:19.020 --> 52:24.020]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[52:24.020 --> 52:29.380]  80% of humanity is at hand.

[54:24.060 --> 54:50.700]  I was watching CNN, Fox, MSNBC, CNBC this morning, and I took an hour jog on the treadmill.
[54:50.700 --> 54:58.380]  And it just really hit me that they know they're lying when they read off those teleprompters.
[54:58.380 --> 55:03.380]  I mean I know the people writing the information for the teleprompters know they're lying,
[55:03.380 --> 55:10.620]  but they have that younger guy, I forget his name, they're on Fox in the morning, paired
[55:10.620 --> 55:16.860]  up with the blondes, they're different blondes on there, it seems like every day.
[55:16.860 --> 55:23.180]  And when he said, yes, what do you think's in this Iranian facility, he started stuttering,
[55:23.180 --> 55:29.660]  he went, I know the people don't trust our intelligence anymore from the WMDs in Iraq,
[55:29.660 --> 55:32.260]  but they do have them, don't they?
[55:32.260 --> 55:37.380]  And he was just radiating, I'm a big fat liar.
[55:37.380 --> 55:41.220]  The body language was screaming, I'm a liar and I don't like this.
[55:41.220 --> 55:44.020]  He was guilty.
[55:44.020 --> 55:48.060]  I mean, he was almost like saying, I'm a liar.
[55:48.060 --> 55:52.540]  He was stuttering, he was stammering, he was blanking, he looked guilty, he almost
[55:52.540 --> 55:57.860]  wretched, he had to look down to make himself say it.
[55:57.860 --> 56:01.020]  Because when you're lying about a country that's going to get bombed and hundreds of
[56:01.020 --> 56:11.100]  thousands are probably going to die, that's a big spiritual border to cross.
[56:11.100 --> 56:16.020]  When you take part in Iraq and in killing over a million Iraqis in the last six and
[56:16.020 --> 56:23.860]  a half years, let me tell you, that's some bad mojo you're taking on your back.
[56:23.860 --> 56:28.780]  And it's a big deal to set up there on TV, talking to three, four, five million people,
[56:28.780 --> 56:37.260]  put an average Fox audience says, depending on the show, but at least two million people
[56:37.260 --> 56:41.540]  to sit there and lie to them and tell them there's WMDs in Iran.
[56:41.540 --> 56:43.940]  I mean, they know it's a complete hoax.
[56:43.940 --> 56:50.100]  In fact, speaking of that, here's the London Guardian today.
[56:50.100 --> 56:56.340]  Georgian attack ahead of war with Russia unjustifiable in law says EU, EU investigation also concludes
[56:56.340 --> 57:02.180]  South Ossetia irregular forces, violated rules of war.
[57:02.180 --> 57:04.660]  And it goes on to try to tell a new lie.
[57:04.660 --> 57:15.580]  But I remember on 888 a year and two months ago, roughly I was suckered for about an hour.
[57:15.580 --> 57:22.060]  Because I mean, I can't believe that CNN and Fox would go on TV with the with the president
[57:22.060 --> 57:28.180]  of Georgia and say, Russia has snuck attack us for no reason, help us were under attack.
[57:28.180 --> 57:31.260]  When it had been on, because I'd gotten up that morning and it had already been on the
[57:31.260 --> 57:37.340]  news for about eight hours, but it was only in European news that Georgian forces backed
[57:37.340 --> 57:42.700]  by US Israeli and NATO forces had launched sneak attacks inside the peacekeeper bases.
[57:42.700 --> 57:46.420]  They had peacekeepers next to the Russians in the same buildings and they were slitting
[57:46.420 --> 57:47.420]  their throats.
[57:47.420 --> 57:52.340]  They were doing special forces tactics of shooting them up at close range and stabbing
[57:52.340 --> 57:57.060]  them in the kidney and grabbing them around the from behind and slitting their throats.
[57:57.060 --> 58:00.780]  And they went on the news for three or four days and said Russia had snuck attack.
[58:00.780 --> 58:03.140]  Now folks, that is lying.
[58:03.140 --> 58:08.540]  That is bold and bravado, hootspo, whatever you want to call it.
[58:08.540 --> 58:10.500]  Let me tell you, that's bold.
[58:10.500 --> 58:11.500]  So bold.
[58:11.500 --> 58:15.580]  I went on the radio, I printed the articles and was watching CNN went in, got on an 11
[58:15.580 --> 58:19.300]  and said, well, they say Russia is attacking Georgia.
[58:19.300 --> 58:23.340]  And then I started to get into emails and foreign news articles and then suddenly CNN
[58:23.340 --> 58:27.740]  went, well, it's not clear who attacked first and then it's just amazing.
[58:27.740 --> 58:29.820]  And it's the same thing with Iran.
[58:29.820 --> 58:34.540]  Iran, two weeks ago, goes, oh, we're opening a new facility in the next few months, one
[58:34.540 --> 58:35.540]  of many.
[58:35.540 --> 58:42.380]  And they go, we caught a secret facility, we've caught them, we've got to attack them.
[58:42.380 --> 58:50.540]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:50.540 --> 58:54.460]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[58:54.460 --> 58:56.700]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[58:56.700 --> 59:02.340]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals
[59:02.340 --> 59:05.340]  in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[59:05.340 --> 59:09.460]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental
[59:09.460 --> 59:10.460]  system diseases.
[59:10.460 --> 59:12.620]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[59:12.620 --> 59:17.380]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of
[59:17.380 --> 59:19.140]  you and your family's drinking water.
[59:19.140 --> 59:23.860]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[59:23.860 --> 59:29.260]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis and ultra-violent light sterilization
[59:29.260 --> 59:30.260]  techniques.
[59:30.260 --> 59:33.460]  That's right, clean water right from the air you breathe.
[59:33.460 --> 59:38.260]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[59:38.260 --> 59:48.300]  That's 1-800-691-6043 or visit Acola Blue on the web at www.ecoloblu.com today.
[59:48.300 --> 1:00:05.180]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.180 --> 1:00:10.020]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:10.020 --> 1:00:11.020]  You want answers?
[1:00:11.020 --> 1:00:12.780]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:12.780 --> 1:00:22.460]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.460 --> 1:00:30.140]  A few weeks ago, we told you about $15 million fines for garage sales.
[1:00:30.140 --> 1:00:34.620]  If you sell any recalled product that's been recalled over the last decade, as if anybody
[1:00:34.620 --> 1:00:39.540]  knows, when upwards of 10% of products get recalled, nobody brings them back, maybe one
[1:00:39.540 --> 1:00:40.860]  out of 100.
[1:00:40.860 --> 1:00:47.900]  They're trying to shut down farms and ranches with the animal ID, premises ID situation.
[1:00:47.900 --> 1:00:54.420]  And now, New York Times is reporting, so is the Associated Press.
[1:00:54.420 --> 1:00:59.500]  State tells a mom, you can't babysit your neighbor's kids or CPS will come take them.
[1:00:59.500 --> 1:01:03.580]  You got to have a license and they're now telling homeschoolers in California, you got
[1:01:03.580 --> 1:01:06.140]  to have a license to homeschool your kids.
[1:01:06.140 --> 1:01:10.500]  Just total criminal government and Obama says you got to be in school year-round.
[1:01:10.500 --> 1:01:12.220]  They want to get that going.
[1:01:12.220 --> 1:01:15.900]  We've had the former head of the Department of Education had a policy on, she was there
[1:01:15.900 --> 1:01:19.180]  in the 80s and they were planning all of this greedily.
[1:01:19.180 --> 1:01:22.780]  Charlotte, is there be?
[1:01:22.780 --> 1:01:24.740]  So that's going on.
[1:01:24.740 --> 1:01:28.540]  Each day before the school bus comes to pick up the neighbor's children, Lisa Snyder did
[1:01:28.540 --> 1:01:32.620]  a favor for the three of the fellow moms.
[1:01:32.620 --> 1:01:36.620]  So many times neighbor kids would come over to our house for breakfast because my mom
[1:01:36.620 --> 1:01:40.340]  liked to make breakfast and two or three of them would come over.
[1:01:40.340 --> 1:01:42.700]  We'd make sweet rolls and scrambled eggs.
[1:01:42.700 --> 1:01:48.780]  We'd wait an hour, play video games, watch TV or something there in the kitchen, run
[1:01:48.780 --> 1:01:53.140]  the living room and have fun all the neighbor kids like my mom.
[1:01:53.140 --> 1:01:54.900]  That's al-Qaeda, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:01:54.900 --> 1:01:56.540]  You live in a prison.
[1:01:56.540 --> 1:02:00.660]  The social workers are there to let you know you're a prisoner and the government's growing
[1:02:00.660 --> 1:02:02.420]  and it's going to mind your life.
[1:02:02.420 --> 1:02:05.220]  Lisa Snyder did a favor for the three of her fellow moms.
[1:02:05.220 --> 1:02:07.180]  Let's get Lisa Snyder on next week, guys.
[1:02:07.180 --> 1:02:10.220]  I want to get this mom on.
[1:02:10.220 --> 1:02:14.980]  Coming their children into her home for about an hour before they left for school.
[1:02:14.980 --> 1:02:17.820]  Regulators who ever see childcare or don't see it as a charity.
[1:02:17.820 --> 1:02:21.460]  So you're not allowed to have association now with your neighbors.
[1:02:21.460 --> 1:02:22.460]  You are prisoners.
[1:02:22.460 --> 1:02:26.700]  You're here to pay money to the bankers, period.
[1:02:26.700 --> 1:02:29.900]  Days after the start of the school year, Snyder received a letter from the Michigan Department
[1:02:29.900 --> 1:02:33.740]  of Human Services warning her that if she continued, she'd be violating a law aimed
[1:02:33.740 --> 1:02:37.060]  at the operations of unlicensed daycare centers.
[1:02:37.060 --> 1:02:39.700]  Now, why are they doing this?
[1:02:39.700 --> 1:02:41.340]  Well, I'm going to explain it later.
[1:02:41.340 --> 1:02:45.500]  The point is, we have Department of Education documents that came out the CIA-funded Miss
[1:02:45.500 --> 1:02:47.700]  Magazine.
[1:02:47.700 --> 1:02:51.620]  They want to split up the family, make both men and women work, two jobs.
[1:02:51.620 --> 1:02:54.780]  So you've got to stay at work until 7.8 at night, like China.
[1:02:54.780 --> 1:03:01.700]  So your kids will then start staying 8, 10, 12 hours, six days a week as many as 14 hours
[1:03:01.700 --> 1:03:03.620]  a day at government schools.
[1:03:03.620 --> 1:03:07.500]  I even heard a caller at News Radio 590 this week on Monday.
[1:03:07.500 --> 1:03:15.900]  They were talking about Obama on the morning show wanting to make you go to school year
[1:03:15.900 --> 1:03:16.900]  around.
[1:03:16.900 --> 1:03:19.900]  And I heard caller after caller, call in and go, I think it's good.
[1:03:19.900 --> 1:03:21.860]  I got to work till 6 o'clock.
[1:03:21.860 --> 1:03:23.340]  I got to go to work at 7.
[1:03:23.340 --> 1:03:25.100]  The bus doesn't come till 8.
[1:03:25.100 --> 1:03:26.780]  I don't like leaving them at home.
[1:03:26.780 --> 1:03:28.700]  I want the government to take my kids.
[1:03:28.700 --> 1:03:32.540]  I'll pay tax money, good, keep my kids.
[1:03:32.540 --> 1:03:36.820]  And then soon it'll be, oh, well, you're not able to keep them in a proper environment.
[1:03:36.820 --> 1:03:38.780]  They have to live in a government dormitory.
[1:03:38.780 --> 1:03:43.060]  That's already started for first 2000, now 20,000 families in England, cameras in the
[1:03:43.060 --> 1:03:44.460]  homes at birth.
[1:03:44.460 --> 1:03:48.900]  Now they're just going to raise the kids they're announcing in government dormitories.
[1:03:48.900 --> 1:03:52.220]  Oh, it's happening.
[1:03:52.220 --> 1:03:54.420]  Oh, it's happening.
[1:03:54.420 --> 1:03:59.900]  And just all of you are going to get the green visits, the home inspection visits.
[1:03:59.900 --> 1:04:03.420]  They're hiring the 3.4 million girl scouts to admittedly help everybody learn how good
[1:04:03.420 --> 1:04:07.380]  homeland security is and spy on neighbors right here in Austin, they give the kids 200
[1:04:07.380 --> 1:04:10.980]  bucks to turn their parents in, they write dossiers for 7th and 8th graders on what's
[1:04:10.980 --> 1:04:14.380]  in the medicine cabinet, there's mommy smoke, funny cigarettes.
[1:04:14.380 --> 1:04:17.060]  This government is as criminal as it gets.
[1:04:17.060 --> 1:04:20.660]  Just like Thomas Jefferson said, the exact level of tyranny you're going to live under
[1:04:20.660 --> 1:04:22.300]  is the level of tyranny you put up with.
[1:04:22.300 --> 1:04:26.380]  All right, I'm going to go to Steve, Dave, Patrick, Dave and Jeremy.
[1:04:26.380 --> 1:04:29.020]  I'm going to hurry through your callers, through the calls.
[1:04:29.020 --> 1:04:30.020]  Jeremy disagrees.
[1:04:30.020 --> 1:04:31.020]  I'll go to him first.
[1:04:31.020 --> 1:04:36.540]  I'm going to hear about how bad I am, I'm sure, whatever, fine.
[1:04:36.540 --> 1:04:40.580]  And we will take your calls, and then I want to get into this issue, and then I want to
[1:04:40.580 --> 1:04:44.220]  talk about how I'm on the White House Enemies list, what I really think of this report.
[1:04:44.220 --> 1:04:46.420]  I think most of it's accurate.
[1:04:46.420 --> 1:04:51.580]  Paul Watson's got a big report going up at PrisonPlanet.com about this.
[1:04:51.580 --> 1:04:57.460]  Also Charlie Sheen responds to Bill O'Reilly's cowardice and a lot more coming up today.
[1:04:57.460 --> 1:04:59.380]  You don't want to miss this important broadcast.
[1:04:59.380 --> 1:05:00.380]  Please stay with us.
[1:05:00.380 --> 1:05:05.060]  The Allusion created by the Power Elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[1:05:05.060 --> 1:05:06.060]  you to eat.
[1:05:06.060 --> 1:05:09.580]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[1:05:09.580 --> 1:05:10.580]  sick?
[1:05:10.580 --> 1:05:12.540]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[1:05:12.540 --> 1:05:14.220]  You don't have to cooperate.
[1:05:14.220 --> 1:05:15.540]  There is a solution.
[1:05:15.540 --> 1:05:19.060]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing
[1:05:19.060 --> 1:05:23.900]  products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[1:05:36.500 --> 1:05:37.500]  manager.
[1:05:37.500 --> 1:05:42.220]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your

[1:06:00.340 --> 1:06:03.660]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[1:06:03.660 --> 1:06:07.500]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[1:06:07.500 --> 1:06:11.940]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[1:06:11.940 --> 1:06:16.420]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[1:06:16.420 --> 1:06:21.580]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes and produces electricity
[1:06:21.580 --> 1:06:22.580]  for free.
[1:06:22.580 --> 1:06:26.220]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[1:06:26.220 --> 1:06:31.020]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers and even keep food from spoiling.
[1:06:31.020 --> 1:06:35.420]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer
[1:06:35.420 --> 1:06:37.580]  through painful power outages again.
[1:06:37.580 --> 1:06:39.980]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[1:06:39.980 --> 1:06:45.860]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and
[1:06:45.860 --> 1:06:47.780]  get off the grid today.

[1:07:02.460 --> 1:07:04.260]  Remain in your houses.
[1:07:04.260 --> 1:07:10.140]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under executive order 11,004.
[1:07:10.140 --> 1:07:11.140]  Will they do it?
[1:07:11.140 --> 1:07:14.020]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[1:07:14.020 --> 1:07:19.620]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing
[1:07:19.620 --> 1:07:20.620]  day.
[1:07:20.620 --> 1:07:23.100]  Think it can't happen here?
[1:07:23.100 --> 1:07:27.260]  Executive order 10,990 locks down all highways.
[1:07:27.260 --> 1:07:32.180]  Executive order 10,995 ceases control of all media outlets.
[1:07:32.180 --> 1:07:36.740]  Executive order 10,998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[1:07:36.740 --> 1:07:42.500]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded and waiting for the right crisis.
[1:07:42.500 --> 1:07:46.660]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America or have questions
[1:07:46.660 --> 1:07:51.060]  about how to survive it, go to marshallawsurvival.com.

[1:08:00.900 --> 1:08:06.820]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's
[1:08:06.820 --> 1:08:12.820]  a war on for your mind.
[1:08:12.820 --> 1:08:32.580]  Okay, I'm going to get into the globe story about myself being on the Obama hit list is
[1:08:32.580 --> 1:08:37.420]  what the headline says, enemies list.
[1:08:37.420 --> 1:08:42.540]  We're going to get into a host of other issues, babysitting being criminalized by CPS, Leslie
[1:08:42.540 --> 1:08:46.460]  and active child abuse, not allowed to have any communities, not allowed to communicate
[1:08:46.460 --> 1:08:49.980]  with your neighbors, your old prisoners, you're not allowed to support each other, supposed
[1:08:49.980 --> 1:08:54.260]  to watch TV, turn your kids over to the state, take a bunch of flu shots and die of cancer
[1:08:54.260 --> 1:08:55.260]  and brain damage.
[1:08:55.260 --> 1:08:56.260]  That's it.
[1:08:56.260 --> 1:08:57.460]  It's called eugenics.
[1:08:57.460 --> 1:09:00.780]  And the criminal scientific dictatorship is now expanding, taking over.
[1:09:00.780 --> 1:09:04.820]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls, Jeremy in California.
[1:09:04.820 --> 1:09:05.820]  Go ahead.
[1:09:05.820 --> 1:09:11.300]  Hey, man, I wanted to call and disagree about two things.
[1:09:11.300 --> 1:09:15.180]  I tried to call a couple of weeks ago, and then I want to disagree about what's taken
[1:09:15.180 --> 1:09:17.860]  place in the last 24 hours.
[1:09:17.860 --> 1:09:19.980]  I first of all, let me put a disclaimer up.
[1:09:19.980 --> 1:09:22.100]  I'm a prisonplanet.tv subscriber.
[1:09:22.100 --> 1:09:23.100]  I know.
[1:09:23.100 --> 1:09:24.100]  People always say that.
[1:09:24.100 --> 1:09:25.100]  Look, look.
[1:09:25.100 --> 1:09:26.100]  It's fine, bro.
[1:09:26.100 --> 1:09:27.100]  You don't have to preface anything.
[1:09:27.100 --> 1:09:28.100]  You went to the head of the line because you disagree.
[1:09:28.100 --> 1:09:29.100]  Just make your point.
[1:09:29.100 --> 1:09:30.100]  Then I got to move on to other callers.
[1:09:30.100 --> 1:09:31.100]  Cool.
[1:09:31.100 --> 1:09:32.100]  No problem.
[1:09:32.100 --> 1:09:36.900]  Yesterday, you had Steve Quail on, and multiple times, you asked, for example, to get somebody
[1:09:36.900 --> 1:09:40.420]  on who he said he was sourcing.
[1:09:40.420 --> 1:09:47.660]  And he constantly ducks out of sourcing any of the things that he presents to you.
[1:09:47.660 --> 1:09:49.940]  And it's getting old.
[1:09:49.940 --> 1:09:51.980]  It's over the top.
[1:09:51.980 --> 1:09:56.980]  And I'm just wondering at what point, I mean, do we pull the plug on somebody like
[1:09:56.980 --> 1:10:00.060]  that and say, hey, you know, like he told you about a shop owner.
[1:10:00.060 --> 1:10:04.340]  That had told you something that was just outrageous about gun identification.
[1:10:04.340 --> 1:10:06.700]  And you said, hey, we got to get that guy on.
[1:10:06.700 --> 1:10:09.780]  And he completely just skated around that.
[1:10:09.780 --> 1:10:12.580]  And it's just, you know, too much hearsay.
[1:10:12.580 --> 1:10:16.660]  Well, I don't want to attack Steve here.
[1:10:16.660 --> 1:10:18.780]  Let me just say this.
[1:10:18.780 --> 1:10:25.140]  We're going to have major breaking news tomorrow and Friday on the hard Montana situation.
[1:10:25.140 --> 1:10:28.300]  Believe me, you want to tune into Mara and Friday, Thursday and Friday.
[1:10:28.300 --> 1:10:30.380]  Word to the wise is sufficient.
[1:10:30.380 --> 1:10:34.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, a little bird told me to tune in tomorrow.
[1:10:34.100 --> 1:10:35.860]  Believe me, you want to tune in tomorrow.
[1:10:35.860 --> 1:10:43.780]  Now quail before this was all over the news told me about this last week, and he told
[1:10:43.780 --> 1:10:49.660]  me they were putting police decals on their cars, that it was a foreign owned company,
[1:10:49.660 --> 1:10:52.060]  that it was secretive and it was a FEMA center.
[1:10:52.060 --> 1:10:54.700]  Now all of that then later came out on the news.
[1:10:54.700 --> 1:10:59.100]  If you go to Paul Watson's latest article on it, it's in the feature news archive.
[1:10:59.100 --> 1:11:02.260]  Now it rolled off the main screen from last night.
[1:11:02.260 --> 1:11:06.020]  He has a new story up there, but, but you want to go to the, he's done three stories.
[1:11:06.020 --> 1:11:09.900]  The second one has all the local, or I can't say all, I don't know if it's all of them,
[1:11:09.900 --> 1:11:17.620]  but like 10 or 11 or maybe more video links to local news and CNN admitting it's a site
[1:11:17.620 --> 1:11:20.060]  they're looking at for Guantanamo detainees.
[1:11:20.060 --> 1:11:23.900]  Then I went and pulled up articles saying they may put, quote, US terrorists there to
[1:11:23.900 --> 1:11:25.900]  Montana's the main state.
[1:11:25.900 --> 1:11:30.660]  They're also using a super max nearby that already has animal rights activists and other
[1:11:30.660 --> 1:11:31.820]  people in it.
[1:11:31.820 --> 1:11:33.860]  Very, very suspicious and bizarre.
[1:11:33.860 --> 1:11:40.020]  And so about 95% of what quail told me beforehand turned out to be accurate.
[1:11:40.020 --> 1:11:44.020]  Now, yes, I called him this morning.
[1:11:44.020 --> 1:11:45.580]  He said he's working on the story.
[1:11:45.580 --> 1:11:46.860]  He also has a business to run.
[1:11:46.860 --> 1:11:48.100]  I'm trying to get him on today.
[1:11:48.100 --> 1:11:49.860]  He says he can come on tomorrow.
[1:11:49.860 --> 1:11:53.460]  He's working on these sources, working on letting me talk to them.
[1:11:53.460 --> 1:11:58.620]  A lot of times, and I know how this is, we'll have a nurse or a police officer or a congressman
[1:11:58.620 --> 1:12:01.380]  or a general and they're ready to come on.
[1:12:01.380 --> 1:12:05.100]  And then last minute they cancel whistleblowers get cold feet.
[1:12:05.100 --> 1:12:09.020]  And it's one thing of somebody knows Steve because he lives up there and they'll talk
[1:12:09.020 --> 1:12:10.020]  to him.
[1:12:10.020 --> 1:12:12.340]  It's another thing to get him to come on air.
[1:12:12.340 --> 1:12:17.460]  So, you know, I have sources all the time that I can't give out.
[1:12:17.460 --> 1:12:22.660]  And so you really got to judge on how often a Steve right and he's right a lot of the
[1:12:22.660 --> 1:12:23.660]  time.
[1:12:23.660 --> 1:12:28.660]  And a lot of times he prefaces what he says with this could be happening or this could
[1:12:28.660 --> 1:12:32.500]  be an operation or they could be getting ready to green like this and then he'll say I believe
[1:12:32.500 --> 1:12:34.500]  they are.
[1:12:34.500 --> 1:12:36.580]  So again, he's one of our guests.
[1:12:36.580 --> 1:12:41.420]  He's not the one that's American police force owned by some foreign company and they even
[1:12:41.420 --> 1:12:42.740]  told the state legislature.
[1:12:42.740 --> 1:12:49.540]  We have video clips of state senators and the governor's office and other people saying
[1:12:49.540 --> 1:12:54.780]  it's secretive, they won't tell us either and we're about to open hearings at the state
[1:12:54.780 --> 1:12:55.780]  level.
[1:12:55.780 --> 1:13:01.860]  They are, they were patrolling, okay, until two days ago there until it hit the news.
[1:13:01.860 --> 1:13:06.300]  They did hire the Billings Gazette reporter who'd written positive articles about him.
[1:13:06.300 --> 1:13:08.260]  Suddenly she quit her job and now works for them.
[1:13:08.260 --> 1:13:10.580]  I mean, this is a creep bill.
[1:13:10.580 --> 1:13:16.100]  So regardless, you can listen to what Steve has to say, take it or leave it.
[1:13:16.100 --> 1:13:17.100]  Okay.
[1:13:17.100 --> 1:13:18.900]  It isn't about Steve.
[1:13:18.900 --> 1:13:21.380]  I mean, are you saying this isn't a FEMA camp?
[1:13:21.380 --> 1:13:26.300]  Are you saying there isn't a shadowy Merck group that runs mercenary operations worldwide
[1:13:26.300 --> 1:13:27.300]  involved?
[1:13:27.300 --> 1:13:29.020]  I mean, have you seen the videos on the news?
[1:13:29.020 --> 1:13:30.660]  I mean, what are you saying?
[1:13:30.660 --> 1:13:34.020]  I've seen Alex, I've seen all the reports.
[1:13:34.020 --> 1:13:35.020]  I've seen what's going on.
[1:13:35.020 --> 1:13:36.020]  I live in Los Angeles.
[1:13:36.020 --> 1:13:40.060]  I know that what they're trying to privatize our men's central jail because they want
[1:13:40.060 --> 1:13:41.980]  to free up more manpower for the streets.
[1:13:41.980 --> 1:13:43.940]  I don't doubt that there's FEMA camps.
[1:13:43.940 --> 1:13:48.020]  I do doubt a guy that says that a certain general informed him that we're being fattened
[1:13:48.020 --> 1:13:49.580]  up for giants.
[1:13:49.580 --> 1:13:50.580]  I do want sources.
[1:13:50.580 --> 1:13:52.420]  I want to know who that general is.
[1:13:52.420 --> 1:13:57.020]  I want to know who that shopkeeper is that said they're going to ID guns by some certain
[1:13:57.020 --> 1:13:58.020]  imprint on them.
[1:13:58.020 --> 1:14:00.020]  I mean, I already know they're going to do that with the anti-fascist profession.
[1:14:00.020 --> 1:14:01.020]  I didn't hear the giant.
[1:14:01.020 --> 1:14:02.020]  I didn't hear the giant.
[1:14:02.020 --> 1:14:03.020]  I didn't hear the giant.
[1:14:03.020 --> 1:14:04.020]  Listen, listen, listen.
[1:14:04.020 --> 1:14:06.020]  This is a disease though in our country.
[1:14:06.020 --> 1:14:09.820]  The Federal Reserve is private and I'm getting questions about Steve Quayle.
[1:14:09.820 --> 1:14:14.580]  I'm getting questions about London LaRouche who I have nothing to do with and don't really
[1:14:14.580 --> 1:14:16.020]  agree with on his solutions.
[1:14:16.020 --> 1:14:20.220]  I already said that and yes, I know Steve has written some interesting books about the
[1:14:20.220 --> 1:14:26.940]  Bible and about the Nephilim and things like that and those are interesting things he's
[1:14:26.940 --> 1:14:27.940]  written.
[1:14:27.940 --> 1:14:31.900]  I know he wrote about weaponized flu and a lot of things that are documented.
[1:14:31.900 --> 1:14:35.220]  So we have Steve on because he lives in Montana and covered that.
[1:14:35.220 --> 1:14:40.460]  But let's see how we're all talking about my guest instead of associated press.
[1:14:40.460 --> 1:14:44.340]  The state tells the mom kids can't come over in the morning, three neighborhood kids to
[1:14:44.340 --> 1:14:45.340]  have breakfast.
[1:14:45.340 --> 1:14:48.980]  You're not allowed in America to have the neighbor kids over for breakfast.
[1:14:48.980 --> 1:14:54.180]  Even if the neighbors want their kids over, you're a president.
[1:14:54.180 --> 1:14:56.420]  Heaven help us.
[1:14:56.420 --> 1:15:01.140]  I mean, look, I understand why the psychology of this works.
[1:15:01.140 --> 1:15:03.140]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[1:15:03.140 --> 1:15:06.060]  I'm going to have eyewitnesses on the ground in Montana.
[1:15:06.060 --> 1:15:08.740]  Okay, tomorrow or the next day.
[1:15:08.740 --> 1:15:10.740]  I'll leave it at that.
[1:15:10.740 --> 1:15:14.340]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[1:15:14.340 --> 1:15:17.460]  Let's try to have a conversation.
[1:15:17.460 --> 1:15:18.860]  Holy mackerel.
[1:15:18.860 --> 1:15:19.860]  Steve in Florida.
[1:15:19.860 --> 1:15:20.860]  You're on the air.
[1:15:20.860 --> 1:15:21.860]  Go ahead.
[1:15:21.860 --> 1:15:22.860]  Hey, Alex.
[1:15:22.860 --> 1:15:23.860]  Good to talk to you.
[1:15:23.860 --> 1:15:28.060]  I did some research on the American police group or force, whatever they call it.
[1:15:28.060 --> 1:15:33.340]  And they're insignia is the coat of arms of the Republic of Serbska, which is the coat
[1:15:33.340 --> 1:15:34.940]  of arms of Bosnia, Herzegovina.
[1:15:34.940 --> 1:15:35.940]  Yeah.
[1:15:35.940 --> 1:15:39.140]  And the guy that heads it up does have a three different aliases.
[1:15:39.140 --> 1:15:40.660]  He speaks with a fire in action.
[1:15:40.660 --> 1:15:43.900]  He's it's a little old man smoking cigarettes.
[1:15:43.900 --> 1:15:47.620]  I have leased the $27 million facility.
[1:15:47.620 --> 1:15:50.140]  We are bringing in mercenary trainers.
[1:15:50.140 --> 1:15:51.860]  I will tell you no more.
[1:15:51.860 --> 1:15:54.260]  I will not tell you who the prisoners are.
[1:15:54.260 --> 1:15:55.260]  I mean, we're going to try.
[1:15:55.260 --> 1:15:56.900]  We have time to play some of these newscasts.
[1:15:56.900 --> 1:16:00.420]  They're up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[1:16:00.420 --> 1:16:06.380]  And I mean, it's bizarre and they are driving around and then they've got the head of the
[1:16:06.380 --> 1:16:11.020]  economic development group, the twin rivers group whose wife's running for mayor and she's
[1:16:11.020 --> 1:16:13.100]  on there saying, don't worry, just go with it.
[1:16:13.100 --> 1:16:14.100]  Don't ask questions.
[1:16:14.100 --> 1:16:16.620]  I mean, these are bizarre statements.
[1:16:16.620 --> 1:16:19.580]  They're on there saying, we can't tell you what we're going to be doing.
[1:16:19.580 --> 1:16:20.580]  It's a secret.
[1:16:20.580 --> 1:16:25.660]  I mean, this is bizarre and well, it's yeah, we did put that on the on the cars that they're
[1:16:25.660 --> 1:16:28.100]  police and this is what we'd like to happen.
[1:16:28.100 --> 1:16:29.780]  I mean, what is going on here?
[1:16:29.780 --> 1:16:35.420]  Well, it's the coat of arms of foreign countries, so that really struck me and it's mainly foreign
[1:16:35.420 --> 1:16:36.420]  mercs.
[1:16:36.420 --> 1:16:37.420]  They admit that.
[1:16:37.420 --> 1:16:38.420]  Yeah.
[1:16:38.420 --> 1:16:45.940]  And, you know, I had the guy on who was the first one to tell me about this.
[1:16:45.940 --> 1:16:49.740]  The other thing real quick, I wanted to just kind of put out that you probably have, I'm
[1:16:49.740 --> 1:16:55.540]  have already seen it is the CDC draft of an isolation order for each one and one and this
[1:16:55.540 --> 1:16:59.420]  ish in this thing is, it tells you, you're not going to go anywhere.
[1:16:59.420 --> 1:17:05.060]  This is, it's an isolation order from the CDC, a swine flu is an A and it says you may
[1:17:05.060 --> 1:17:12.620]  be exposed or are suspected of being exposed to swine flu.
[1:17:12.620 --> 1:17:15.140]  We posted that under level six.
[1:17:15.140 --> 1:17:19.460]  They can do mass quarantines, lockdowns if they think you might be sick.
[1:17:19.460 --> 1:17:22.900]  And what they're drilling to do is set up checkpoints and just drag you off and then
[1:17:22.900 --> 1:17:25.780]  let you out in a few weeks and it'll set the precedent.
[1:17:25.780 --> 1:17:30.460]  Yeah, you get grabbed by guys in the backs of army trucks with the police and it's normal
[1:17:30.460 --> 1:17:31.460]  to do.
[1:17:31.460 --> 1:17:33.900]  You know, it's, hey, they were, I was in a camp once they released me.
[1:17:33.900 --> 1:17:35.940]  They gave me a lollipop and a care package.
[1:17:35.940 --> 1:17:38.020]  Hey, they had a local band come play for us.
[1:17:38.020 --> 1:17:43.060]  He just sets the precedent of, oh, just like you put a feeder out to train wild hogs to
[1:17:43.060 --> 1:17:47.340]  come in to be trapped and for a month you feed them and let them get away with it or
[1:17:47.340 --> 1:17:50.260]  put range cubes out for them or a salt lick out for them.
[1:17:50.260 --> 1:17:51.820]  And the pigs are like, it's pretty good.
[1:17:51.820 --> 1:17:56.020]  It's nice to have the army out here running checkpoints to stop drunk drivers.
[1:17:56.020 --> 1:17:58.020]  And it's just all conditioning.
[1:17:58.020 --> 1:18:01.140]  Most people I know won't stand for this.
[1:18:01.140 --> 1:18:02.140]  They won't take it.
[1:18:02.140 --> 1:18:03.140]  They won't stand for it.
[1:18:03.140 --> 1:18:05.860]  But that's all I have for each one of the point that out.
[1:18:05.860 --> 1:18:06.860]  Yeah.
[1:18:06.860 --> 1:18:07.860]  You know what?
[1:18:07.860 --> 1:18:09.140]  I saw that story two days ago.
[1:18:09.140 --> 1:18:18.460]  Watson pointed posted the CDC or maybe it was Kurt CDC document and I told him to do
[1:18:18.460 --> 1:18:22.860]  this back in April and I don't think they've reposted it since we need to put a small banner
[1:18:22.860 --> 1:18:28.140]  on the right hand side of each site that says flu archive where all the documents, all the
[1:18:28.140 --> 1:18:32.540]  inserts, all the eyewitness reports, all the stories are posted.
[1:18:32.540 --> 1:18:39.620]  In fact, right now, call Kurt, call Watson, call Steve, tell him, create an archive because
[1:18:39.620 --> 1:18:45.320]  it's hard to find all these so many roll on and roll off, update the archive.
[1:18:45.320 --> 1:18:46.320]  We got wordpress.
[1:18:46.320 --> 1:18:47.320]  It's easy.
[1:18:47.320 --> 1:18:48.320]  Get it up on both sides.
[1:18:48.320 --> 1:18:55.780]  Don't need a big giant banner, just a side banner saying flu news or tracking the flu
[1:18:55.780 --> 1:18:57.300]  because it is so vitally important.
[1:18:57.300 --> 1:19:00.780]  Let's talk to Patrick and Marilyn Patrick here on the air.
[1:19:00.780 --> 1:19:04.980]  First off, it's a real honor speaking with you today, sir.
[1:19:04.980 --> 1:19:06.620]  Good talk to you.
[1:19:06.620 --> 1:19:10.860]  I'm calling just because a few days ago I heard on your show that some of your crew
[1:19:10.860 --> 1:19:13.140]  was arrested illegally by the police at G20.
[1:19:13.140 --> 1:19:17.900]  One of my crew members and then also Luke Radowski and other We Are Change members,
[1:19:17.900 --> 1:19:19.620]  yes, and then tortured by the military.
[1:19:19.620 --> 1:19:20.620]  Right.
[1:19:20.620 --> 1:19:21.820]  Well, I mean, you're familiar with Barry Cooper.
[1:19:21.820 --> 1:19:23.420]  He was on your show before.
[1:19:23.420 --> 1:19:24.700]  I've been talking to him.
[1:19:24.700 --> 1:19:28.220]  He's been helping me file a lawsuit against the political police department here for a
[1:19:28.220 --> 1:19:32.220]  false arrest, and I talked to him about your situation.
[1:19:32.220 --> 1:19:33.220]  He wants to help you guys out.
[1:19:33.220 --> 1:19:36.220]  Come on the show and educate people about what's going on.
[1:19:36.220 --> 1:19:37.220]  Yeah, well, that's nice to Barry.
[1:19:37.220 --> 1:19:39.220]  We sell some of his videos.
[1:19:39.220 --> 1:19:44.020]  It's just, yeah, we know we go around and sue people, and that's good for some folks.
[1:19:44.020 --> 1:19:48.460]  But we have to pick our battles, and that's good for some people to do with us.
[1:19:48.460 --> 1:19:53.980]  We don't have time to do that as all this news is breaking and developing.
[1:19:53.980 --> 1:19:57.380]  But Luke Radowski may have to because they've charged him with a bunch of stuff, but thank
[1:19:57.380 --> 1:19:58.380]  you.
[1:19:58.380 --> 1:20:01.540]  We'll be right back.
[1:20:01.540 --> 1:20:05.100]  Attention all U.S. homeowners stuck in high interest rate mortgages.
[1:20:05.100 --> 1:20:09.220]  Are you finding it harder and harder to keep up with your monthly mortgage payments?
[1:20:09.220 --> 1:20:13.620]  Homeowners with all types of credit can now apply for FHA government insured 30-year fixed
[1:20:13.620 --> 1:20:17.920]  rates as low as 4.875 percent from top-dot mortgage.
[1:20:17.920 --> 1:20:22.780]  With an FHA loan from top-dot, you can consolidate debt, lower your mortgage payments, or get
[1:20:22.780 --> 1:20:24.420]  cash for any reason.
[1:20:24.420 --> 1:20:29.060]  I repeat, you can now refinance your current high interest rate mortgage to a 30-year fixed
[1:20:29.060 --> 1:20:32.000]  rate as low as 4.875 percent.
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:34.660]  You could save hundreds of dollars every month.

[1:20:57.260 --> 1:21:01.420]  Top-dot is a licensed mortgage banker, rates based on an APR of 5.20 percent.
[1:21:01.420 --> 1:21:06.860]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:21:06.860 --> 1:21:12.820]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[1:21:12.820 --> 1:21:14.820]  just as well-funded.
[1:21:14.820 --> 1:21:19.980]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:21:19.980 --> 1:21:20.980]  of the American people.
[1:21:20.980 --> 1:21:25.900]  Well, Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:21:25.900 --> 1:21:30.980]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:21:30.980 --> 1:21:37.500]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:21:37.500 --> 1:21:41.060]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[1:21:41.060 --> 1:21:47.980]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:21:53.460 --> 1:21:56.180]  high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:21:56.180 --> 1:22:01.620]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:22:01.620 --> 1:22:02.620]  Gold isn't for you.
[1:22:02.620 --> 1:22:06.580]  Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious
[1:22:06.580 --> 1:22:07.900]  metal investing firms.
[1:22:07.900 --> 1:22:08.900]  I get it.
[1:22:08.900 --> 1:22:12.580]  If you buy gold, if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the
[1:22:12.580 --> 1:22:17.140]  Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that social security would
[1:22:17.140 --> 1:22:18.340]  be there for you.
[1:22:18.340 --> 1:22:19.580]  That's not what's happening.
[1:22:19.580 --> 1:22:24.420]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the
[1:22:24.420 --> 1:22:28.020]  dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[1:22:28.020 --> 1:22:31.460]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[1:22:31.460 --> 1:22:35.820]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[1:22:35.820 --> 1:22:41.740]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[1:22:41.740 --> 1:22:45.100]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[1:22:45.100 --> 1:22:46.100]  You should, too.
[1:22:46.100 --> 1:22:47.100]  Find out what they know.
[1:22:47.100 --> 1:22:50.380]  Call us, and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well.
[1:22:50.380 --> 1:22:51.380]  Free.
[1:22:51.380 --> 1:22:52.380]  800-686-2237.
[1:22:52.380 --> 1:22:53.380]  800-686-2237.
[1:22:53.380 --> 1:22:54.380]  That's 800-686-2237.
[1:22:54.380 --> 1:23:05.900]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[1:23:05.900 --> 1:23:10.180]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[1:23:10.180 --> 1:23:15.020]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[1:23:15.020 --> 1:23:18.460]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:23:18.460 --> 1:23:23.220]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[1:23:23.220 --> 1:23:24.420]  across America.
[1:23:24.420 --> 1:23:28.100]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[1:23:28.100 --> 1:23:31.860]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[1:23:31.860 --> 1:23:32.860]  healthier I feel.
[1:23:32.860 --> 1:23:35.540]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:23:35.540 --> 1:23:40.740]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventive
[1:23:40.740 --> 1:23:43.260]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[1:24:13.020 --> 1:24:14.820]  Let's go to David in Montana.
[1:24:14.820 --> 1:24:19.540]  Got the private mercs running around, running $27 million detention facilities.
[1:24:19.540 --> 1:24:24.540]  They're openly saying they may put suspected terrorists in.
[1:24:24.540 --> 1:24:25.540]  That's confirmed.
[1:24:25.540 --> 1:24:30.980]  Mainstream news, CNN, the local billings news, TV, radio, print.
[1:24:30.980 --> 1:24:35.740]  It's all up at prismplanet.com and infowars.com.
[1:24:35.740 --> 1:24:39.140]  Let's go to David in Montana, big sky country.
[1:24:39.140 --> 1:24:40.140]  David?
[1:24:40.140 --> 1:24:42.820]  Rick, let us live while we live.
[1:24:42.820 --> 1:24:45.820]  It's good to talk to you, man.
[1:24:45.820 --> 1:24:54.740]  This joint in Hardin, it's been a talk point on talk radio out here in Montana for a while.
[1:24:54.740 --> 1:24:57.940]  It was built to be a private prison.
[1:24:57.940 --> 1:25:00.380]  They couldn't get prisoners for it.
[1:25:00.380 --> 1:25:05.580]  So now, a week ago, it was reported to us that it was going to be an international police
[1:25:05.580 --> 1:25:08.020]  training facility.
[1:25:08.020 --> 1:25:11.180]  And later on, that they're going to get prisoners there.
[1:25:11.180 --> 1:25:14.620]  Yeah, you're going to have foreign mercenaries training.
[1:25:14.620 --> 1:25:20.860]  I've got it at more than five newscasts where there's where the group is saying that weirdos
[1:25:20.860 --> 1:25:26.100]  with foreign accents going, yes, we will not tell you the specifics of it, but it will
[1:25:26.100 --> 1:25:30.580]  be ours now training for anti-terror personnel.
[1:25:30.580 --> 1:25:35.700]  And we will be your police department and we will hold the prisoners here and we get
[1:25:35.700 --> 1:25:42.180]  a decent of 5,000 acres as I did formally trained in Transylvania.
[1:25:42.180 --> 1:25:46.940]  I mean, and then people were in denial about this.
[1:25:46.940 --> 1:25:50.700]  And the biggest pick bait I think is credit cards, man.
[1:25:50.700 --> 1:25:54.620]  They got everybody thinking they can't live without them.
[1:25:54.620 --> 1:25:58.300]  And Iran is the biggest bank that doesn't use interest.
[1:25:58.300 --> 1:26:00.580]  So you wonder why we want them out of the picture.
[1:26:00.580 --> 1:26:06.140]  We won't be able to make no money going through there because they don't use the interest.
[1:26:06.140 --> 1:26:10.420]  Well, going back to Hardin, Montana.
[1:26:10.420 --> 1:26:12.620]  I mean, what are locals saying about this?
[1:26:12.620 --> 1:26:16.700]  And what are they saying now about American police force, which is anything but American
[1:26:16.700 --> 1:26:21.100]  driving around with its double eagle, Illuminati insignia.
[1:26:21.100 --> 1:26:26.540]  It's not just a Serbian symbol with saying they're the local police.
[1:26:26.540 --> 1:26:32.420]  You know, it's on an Indian reservation, so that supersedes a lot of different kind of
[1:26:32.420 --> 1:26:37.620]  laws, you know, so it's on the reservation that the little bighorn was fought on.
[1:26:37.620 --> 1:26:42.220]  Yeah, the little bighorn is 15 miles away, though, according to the maps I have.
[1:26:42.220 --> 1:26:44.860]  So it borders the reservation and the town of Hardin.
[1:26:44.860 --> 1:26:47.980]  Are you saying Hardin is in the reservation?
[1:26:47.980 --> 1:26:50.420]  It's in the reservation, according to my map.
[1:26:50.420 --> 1:26:52.220]  It's got the, you know, the lines.
[1:26:52.220 --> 1:26:53.220]  Well, that's why CNN is-
[1:26:53.220 --> 1:26:59.180]  It's in the northwest corner of the Indian reservation.
[1:26:59.180 --> 1:27:04.700]  Well, that's why CNN said they're looking at it because it's like Guantanamo in Cuba.
[1:27:04.700 --> 1:27:06.820]  It's kind of like a no man's land.
[1:27:06.820 --> 1:27:08.380]  It's a different nation, right?
[1:27:08.380 --> 1:27:11.900]  You know, they're under, you know, you know, because-
[1:27:11.900 --> 1:27:14.300]  So do they, I mean, well, then what did the tribal police say?
[1:27:14.300 --> 1:27:17.860]  I mean, I know the sheriff of Bighorn won't talk about it.
[1:27:17.860 --> 1:27:20.100]  It's about 500 miles away from me.
[1:27:20.100 --> 1:27:25.540]  I'm way up in the northwest corner of Montana, by Canada, by Glacier National Park.
[1:27:25.540 --> 1:27:26.820]  Oh, that's beautiful up there.
[1:27:26.820 --> 1:27:28.660]  Hey, listen, thanks for the call.
[1:27:28.660 --> 1:27:31.460]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gary in Arkansas.
[1:27:31.460 --> 1:27:33.460]  Gary, you're on the air.
[1:27:33.460 --> 1:27:35.180]  It's nice to talk to you, Alex.
[1:27:35.180 --> 1:27:37.700]  Nice talk to you, Gary.
[1:27:37.700 --> 1:27:42.460]  I just, I wanted to say thanks for the way you point out.
[1:27:42.460 --> 1:27:44.300]  The way that these people operate.
[1:27:44.300 --> 1:27:51.340]  I live up here in a little tiny community up here in North Arkansas that's, it's non-corporatized
[1:27:51.340 --> 1:27:56.860]  and that's the reason I moved up here several years ago, that even up here they infiltrate
[1:27:56.860 --> 1:28:02.300]  by taking over the Masonic lodges and then the Masonic lodges bring in outside law enforcement
[1:28:02.300 --> 1:28:04.100]  people into the county.
[1:28:04.100 --> 1:28:05.100]  And that's happened here.
[1:28:05.100 --> 1:28:07.780]  It's happening in all the counties.
[1:28:07.780 --> 1:28:12.940]  And then suddenly they put fines and fees on you when you're living out on a farm and
[1:28:12.940 --> 1:28:14.700]  bureaucrats say, you will let me in.
[1:28:14.700 --> 1:28:16.460]  I am doing an inspection.
[1:28:16.460 --> 1:28:18.900]  They're just nothing but blood-sucking maggots.
[1:28:18.900 --> 1:28:19.900]  Absolutely.
[1:28:19.900 --> 1:28:23.660]  And there's going to come a point of tyranny at some point when each man's going to have
[1:28:23.660 --> 1:28:28.100]  to decide that it's beyond his ability to live under anymore.
[1:28:28.100 --> 1:28:32.500]  And I'm going to curb what I really want to say because I know we're being monitored.
[1:28:32.500 --> 1:28:37.260]  But I'm really impressed at the men of this country because when I grew up we were strong
[1:28:37.260 --> 1:28:38.260]  individuals.
[1:28:38.260 --> 1:28:42.100]  I'm 45 and I remember what this country used to be like.
[1:28:42.100 --> 1:28:45.780]  And when a man wouldn't put up with this, whether it came from a police officer or a
[1:28:45.780 --> 1:28:51.860]  politician or whoever, tasering little girls and women because they don't get out of the
[1:28:51.860 --> 1:28:56.740]  police car fast enough putting pepper spray in children's eyes and beating old ladies
[1:28:56.740 --> 1:28:57.740]  in the head.
[1:28:57.740 --> 1:29:00.300]  What in the hell is wrong with you men in this country?
[1:29:00.300 --> 1:29:05.460]  You better get down on your knees and pray and then stand up and get ready to fight.
[1:29:05.460 --> 1:29:06.460]  That's all I wanted to say.
[1:29:06.460 --> 1:29:07.460]  Well, I'll say this.
[1:29:07.460 --> 1:29:10.540]  I'll say this to what you just said and it was well said.
[1:29:10.540 --> 1:29:15.180]  They got all their excuses and all their rationales for warrantless blood draw checkpoints and
[1:29:15.180 --> 1:29:20.060]  face scanning cameras and police in black uniforms and police dogs attacking all women
[1:29:20.060 --> 1:29:21.900]  in Pittsburgh for the G 20.
[1:29:21.900 --> 1:29:23.940]  But they didn't do this in the past.
[1:29:23.940 --> 1:29:25.420]  This is all new.
[1:29:25.420 --> 1:29:29.900]  They may have a bunch of slick excuses for it, but it's all new and the whole homeland
[1:29:29.900 --> 1:29:33.580]  security thing was set up for the American people.
[1:29:33.580 --> 1:29:40.340]  We were lied to and I told people day one, God bless you, Gary, Mike, Sandra, Joe, Matthew
[1:29:40.340 --> 1:29:41.500]  and others.
[1:29:41.500 --> 1:29:42.500]  Your calls are coming up.
[1:29:42.500 --> 1:29:45.500]  We'll get into the enemy's list of the White House that I'm reportedly on.
[1:29:45.500 --> 1:29:48.780]  I tell you, that's creepy and a lot more.
[1:29:48.780 --> 1:29:49.780]  Stay with us.
[1:29:49.780 --> 1:29:51.540]  Ray McGovern is coming up.
[1:29:51.540 --> 1:29:52.820]  We're on the march.
[1:29:52.820 --> 1:29:55.300]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:55.300 --> 1:29:58.740]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:58.740 --> 1:30:04.220]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:30:04.220 --> 1:30:08.580]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[1:30:08.580 --> 1:30:09.580]  do you want?
[1:30:09.580 --> 1:30:15.160]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[1:30:15.160 --> 1:30:16.660]  Food is your only ammunition.
[1:30:16.660 --> 1:30:17.660]  How much do you want?
[1:30:17.660 --> 1:30:18.940]  When do you want it?
[1:30:18.940 --> 1:30:20.900]  Now or after the battle starts.
[1:30:20.900 --> 1:30:22.020]  When will you need it?
[1:30:22.020 --> 1:30:24.140]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:30:24.140 --> 1:30:25.500]  Will there be any food?
[1:30:25.500 --> 1:30:26.940]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:30:26.940 --> 1:30:31.100]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:30:31.100 --> 1:30:32.260]  and be immunized?
[1:30:32.260 --> 1:30:36.060]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:30:36.060 --> 1:30:39.620]  It is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:30:39.620 --> 1:30:40.860]  How much will you need?
[1:30:40.860 --> 1:30:41.860]  We don't know.
[1:30:41.860 --> 1:30:42.860]  How much do you want?
[1:30:42.860 --> 1:30:43.860]  All you can get.
[1:30:43.860 --> 1:30:44.860]  I'm Alex Jones.

[1:31:00.340 --> 1:31:05.020]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[1:31:05.020 --> 1:31:06.020]  you to eat.
[1:31:06.020 --> 1:31:09.700]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[1:31:09.700 --> 1:31:10.700]  sick?
[1:31:10.700 --> 1:31:12.500]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[1:31:12.500 --> 1:31:14.140]  You don't have to cooperate.

[1:32:59.340 --> 1:33:00.340]  Best MZ.
[1:33:00.340 --> 1:33:15.140]  We're going to continue with your phone calls, not a bunch of financial news to cover as
[1:33:15.140 --> 1:33:20.660]  well, and yes, Paul Watson's writing a big article, will be up in the next 30 minutes
[1:33:20.660 --> 1:33:25.140]  or so dealing with how I've been listed by the White House on the enemy's list.
[1:33:25.140 --> 1:33:38.500]  I want to give you the full history of the enemy's list under Nixon, Clinton, and others.
[1:33:38.500 --> 1:33:46.260]  In fact, that article did just now go up on prisonplanet.com.
[1:33:46.260 --> 1:33:52.580]  Yours truly, Alejandro Jones, now on the White House enemy's list, and they're reporting
[1:33:52.580 --> 1:33:57.340]  in the news that Bill Clinton is running the list, and I'll tell you that's disconcerting
[1:33:57.340 --> 1:34:03.220]  because Bill Clinton, hundreds and hundreds of people that were on his list, and it did
[1:34:03.220 --> 1:34:09.700]  come out mainstream news that you'd have a list, they would end up dying, and I don't
[1:34:09.700 --> 1:34:10.700]  want to die.
[1:34:10.700 --> 1:34:15.780]  I'll be honest with you, but you know what?
[1:34:15.780 --> 1:34:20.140]  The tree of liberty must be watered from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[1:34:20.140 --> 1:34:24.260]  That's what the shirt says I'm wearing right now, gassed in flag on the front.
[1:34:24.260 --> 1:34:28.140]  Don't try it on me on the back of Thomas Jefferson quote.
[1:34:28.140 --> 1:34:31.900]  Speaking of that, before we go to this guest who's doing yeoman's work for liberty and
[1:34:31.900 --> 1:34:36.420]  freedom and the alternative press, you can get all the great t-shirts and materials.
[1:34:36.420 --> 1:34:41.820]  We have some new t-shirts, we have more than 50 different shirts now, but everybody requested
[1:34:41.820 --> 1:34:43.180]  a gassed in flag shirt.
[1:34:43.180 --> 1:34:47.220]  So we made the yellow one, the classic yellow shirt with the snake on the front and the
[1:34:47.220 --> 1:34:48.820]  Thomas Jefferson quote on the back.
[1:34:48.820 --> 1:34:54.180]  We now have several variants of other gassed in flag shirts.
[1:34:54.180 --> 1:34:58.820]  We have a pre-revolutionary war one, join or die.
[1:34:58.820 --> 1:35:05.140]  Actually, Benjamin Franklin engraved this in the five years leading up to the start
[1:35:05.140 --> 1:35:11.060]  of the war, saying that New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Vermont, South
[1:35:11.060 --> 1:35:16.060]  Carolina, North Carolina, and others needed to join.
[1:35:16.060 --> 1:35:21.300]  So it's a snake severed in pieces, it says join or die info wars.com on the front and
[1:35:21.300 --> 1:35:27.340]  on the back it's got a beautiful logo that Janae, our great graphics lady, put together.
[1:35:27.340 --> 1:35:30.860]  It says join info wars.com.
[1:35:30.860 --> 1:35:35.060]  So just check it out at info wars.com, new shirts, several other new shirts have been
[1:35:35.060 --> 1:35:36.060]  added.
[1:35:36.060 --> 1:35:41.300]  We also have a deal where you can get the Obama Joker shirt variants and when they're sold
[1:35:41.300 --> 1:35:44.180]  out, we're not making any more and they're getting close.
[1:35:44.180 --> 1:35:50.180]  But if you pre-order Fall the Republic, my new film that's coming out October 21st, we
[1:35:50.180 --> 1:35:54.700]  are setting aside the Obama Joker shirt for you.
[1:35:54.700 --> 1:35:59.620]  So in the next two and a half weeks, so when we ship it out to you, you can get one of
[1:35:59.620 --> 1:36:05.260]  those shirts for $5.95, that's very close to cost, and it shows Obama with info wars
[1:36:05.260 --> 1:36:11.700]  under him, Obama with the word socialism under him, Obama with the word fascism under him,
[1:36:11.700 --> 1:36:13.580]  and Obama with the term New World Order.
[1:36:13.580 --> 1:36:17.780]  Now as the shirts sell out, we will have to remove options.
[1:36:17.780 --> 1:36:25.740]  So if you want to get one of these shirts put out by us, it's a collector's edition,
[1:36:25.740 --> 1:36:29.940]  get your order in now and you can get it discounted down to basically cost, I think it's like
[1:36:29.940 --> 1:36:33.140]  a dollar above cost, when you get it with Fall the Republic.
[1:36:33.140 --> 1:36:36.780]  Fall the Republic is the most powerful film.
[1:36:36.780 --> 1:36:41.860]  It is a quantum leap above anything I've made and we've made some powerful films, Road
[1:36:41.860 --> 1:36:47.940]  to Terrany, Martial Law, Terror Storm, the Obama Deception, Obama Deception is great
[1:36:47.940 --> 1:36:53.500]  for shattering a left-right paradigm showing how Bush and Obama work for the same people,
[1:36:53.500 --> 1:36:59.460]  both parties controlled, but this is a quantum leap and the budgets twice are roughly twice,
[1:36:59.460 --> 1:37:07.580]  a little bit under twice actually, any film I've ever made and it's got so many informative
[1:37:07.580 --> 1:37:09.540]  people in it.
[1:37:09.540 --> 1:37:13.060]  And we've got a listing of some of those folks that are in it, but just briefly, Webster
[1:37:13.060 --> 1:37:20.940]  Tarpley, it's got G. Edward Griffin, it's got Jesse Ventura, it's got Max Kaiser, it's
[1:37:20.940 --> 1:37:29.220]  got John Perkins, it's got Black, the Economist, Alan Watt, Alan Watt is just amazing, Alan
[1:37:29.220 --> 1:37:33.580]  Watt's a big part of it and you think Alan Watt's strong on the radio, I mean he has
[1:37:33.580 --> 1:37:41.700]  major presence on camera and it's volume one, volume two is coming out March 15th, we ended
[1:37:41.700 --> 1:37:45.460]  up like a four and a half hour film, so I decided just to cut it in half and make two
[1:37:45.460 --> 1:37:50.460]  volumes and then update and beef up the second volume, which is going to be on eugenics and
[1:37:50.460 --> 1:37:52.780]  the extermination plan and how to beat them.
[1:37:52.780 --> 1:37:55.940]  This one's on the banking takeover, who the new order are, how they're using the TV to
[1:37:55.940 --> 1:38:03.060]  mesmerize, mind control people, the Stasi spies, it is a quantum leap and I didn't even
[1:38:03.060 --> 1:38:04.500]  mention half the people that are in it.
[1:38:04.500 --> 1:38:08.700]  We went to 10 cities, we went and interviewed the Oathkeepers, the extras have got Charlie
[1:38:08.700 --> 1:38:14.340]  Sheen and the Oathkeepers, it's a two hour, 24 minute film, so it's a biggin, it's a
[1:38:14.340 --> 1:38:22.060]  classic Alex Jones film, you can pre-order it now at infowars.com, that's infowars.com
[1:38:22.060 --> 1:38:27.620]  and get it discounted with other videos and books like Camp FEMA and you can also call

[1:38:49.540 --> 1:38:56.300]  today if you want to be the first to get it because in the order the orders come in, in
[1:38:56.300 --> 1:39:00.220]  the order they come in, that's how they're shipped out, we'll probably get it four or
[1:39:00.220 --> 1:39:04.380]  five days before the date, we got it off earlier to the manufacturers this year, we usually
[1:39:04.380 --> 1:39:10.340]  get it like the day before, so if we do get it early like we're supposed to, I will start
[1:39:10.340 --> 1:39:14.700]  shipping three or four days before, so a lot of you because it ships UPS will get it on
[1:39:14.700 --> 1:39:18.100]  or before the date, but can't make any promises, we're really overstrapped here but we've
[1:39:18.100 --> 1:39:23.180]  hired a lot of other people in the back office and then shipping seasonally just for this,
[1:39:23.180 --> 1:39:27.460]  so we're really trying to get this out early, not just on time, so again, follow the republic
[1:39:27.460 --> 1:39:31.900]  infowars.com pre-order today or go ahead and write to me and by the time your mail gets
[1:39:31.900 --> 1:39:35.740]  here and we get it packaged up, we're two weeks away now from the release of the film,
[1:39:35.740 --> 1:39:41.380]  it'll also be at prisonplanet.tv and super high quality, okay, enough said on that front,
[1:39:41.380 --> 1:39:46.020]  coming up, Gore Vidal tells the Times of London, we'll have a dictatorship soon in the U.S.
[1:39:46.020 --> 1:39:50.060]  and we already do, pal, we've had Vidal on before, Al Gore's cousin, we'll have him back
[1:39:50.060 --> 1:39:57.060]  on again. We go to Dan Fight, he's an internet developer, volunteer journalist with the Twin
[1:39:57.060 --> 1:40:01.460]  Cities into media and a former political reporter for the Minnesota State Capitol, the cameraman
[1:40:01.460 --> 1:40:04.860]  has shot most of the videos unavailable, but one of the editors would be happy to talk
[1:40:04.860 --> 1:40:10.460]  and that's the fella that shot this, that's Dan Fight, the person that put it up so he
[1:40:10.460 --> 1:40:16.420]  can speak to it and he's also been covering the preliminary trials of people and what
[1:40:16.420 --> 1:40:21.020]  people are being charged with, the young lady, where the police come up and knock her down
[1:40:21.020 --> 1:40:25.660]  with a billy club with brute force, knock her down again and she picks up her bike and
[1:40:25.660 --> 1:40:30.020]  just kind of tosses it at them, they've charged her with felony assault on the godlike storm
[1:40:30.020 --> 1:40:33.940]  troopers. So now common law in the bill of rights is you can defend yourself against
[1:40:33.940 --> 1:40:39.140]  illegal assault, but they say no and even people that didn't assault them, they're charging
[1:40:39.140 --> 1:40:44.820]  them with this, but the video that's gotten, last time I saw it, 60 something thousand
[1:40:44.820 --> 1:40:48.940]  views, there's a lot of other videos, we have similar video, we're just now getting uploaded,
[1:40:48.940 --> 1:40:54.020]  my guys just got back this weekend when Rob Do got out of jail, he came back and one
[1:40:54.020 --> 1:40:59.460]  of his best friends died of cancer, 30 something year old woman, everybody's died of cancer
[1:40:59.460 --> 1:41:04.180]  now, it's all part of, take your shots, everything's fine, but cancer viruses are in it, but
[1:41:04.180 --> 1:41:07.540]  that's, that matter if it's admitted, just take them, that matter if it's in the insert,
[1:41:07.540 --> 1:41:13.420]  just take them, take them, eugenics, but Dan Fight, good to have you on with us, appreciate
[1:41:13.420 --> 1:41:19.180]  you joining us. Yeah, good to talk to you Alex. Okay, you were there for this, you edited
[1:41:19.180 --> 1:41:25.340]  the video, give us your boil down take on the G20 police riots we witnessed and culminating
[1:41:25.340 --> 1:41:29.540]  on Friday night with the assault on peaceful people in a park, hunting people down and
[1:41:29.540 --> 1:41:35.260]  then what's happening now? Sure, absolutely Alex. Well, basically I'm from Minneapolis
[1:41:35.260 --> 1:41:40.300]  and I was motivated to come out and check out the G20 because last year we had the Republican
[1:41:40.300 --> 1:41:45.100]  National Convention come to town, which was another national security special event, another
[1:41:45.100 --> 1:41:50.700]  heavily militarized and federalized operation, it's kind of half security operation, you
[1:41:50.700 --> 1:41:55.300]  know, half live exercise, no one's really accountable for anything in the Joint Command
[1:41:55.300 --> 1:41:59.660]  Center and all that kind of thing, so I felt like I'd already kind of seen the sort of
[1:41:59.660 --> 1:42:03.860]  tricks that they pull in the playbook they're using and so I felt pretty prepared to figure
[1:42:03.860 --> 1:42:09.500]  out what was going on at the G20 and help the people that live here protect their constitutional
[1:42:09.500 --> 1:42:15.260]  rights and protect themselves from police brutality, use video and video cameras and
[1:42:15.260 --> 1:42:21.180]  being out on the streets to cover what's really going on as well as expose police operations
[1:42:21.180 --> 1:42:25.900]  such as the video with the three provocateurs in the March that we're going to talk about
[1:42:25.900 --> 1:42:30.620]  that but I wasn't there but had my crew there and watching all the hundreds of YouTube videos
[1:42:30.620 --> 1:42:37.740]  it's safe to say this was a massive escalation from Denver or from Minneapolis St. Paul
[1:42:37.740 --> 1:42:44.820]  sound weapons, rubber bullets, bean bags, CES, tear gas, yeah, and all the different
[1:42:44.820 --> 1:42:49.140]  police units from different police dogs, Billy clubs, I'm sorry, yeah, yeah, well all the
[1:42:49.140 --> 1:42:52.260]  different police units from different parts of the country bring different weapons to
[1:42:52.260 --> 1:42:56.260]  I tried asking them what their munitions were and they didn't want to tell me but yeah,
[1:42:56.260 --> 1:43:01.260]  I think the new precedent setting thing is the idea that somehow somebody wants us to
[1:43:01.260 --> 1:43:05.980]  accept the idea that directed energy weapons or the long range acoustic device, the LRAD
[1:43:05.980 --> 1:43:10.860]  should actually be okay with being used against American demonstrators in our own country
[1:43:10.860 --> 1:43:14.940]  and I just, you know, the big question is, well, who's pushing that agenda? Who's trying
[1:43:14.940 --> 1:43:18.980]  to tell us that that's normal? We know the head of the Air Force says, use it on Americans
[1:43:18.980 --> 1:43:23.580]  then you can use it worldwide. If you can use it in Fallujah, why not use it here? Why not
[1:43:23.580 --> 1:43:28.180]  use Swords? Yeah, exactly. And so they're trying to, you know, reset the norms of our
[1:43:28.180 --> 1:43:33.380]  society and then they use really advanced, you know, information warfare, kind of information
[1:43:33.380 --> 1:43:38.740]  operation tactics to manipulate the mainstream press and they admitted this was all a test
[1:43:38.740 --> 1:43:43.300]  with the Army and Secret Service and FBI. They're running it from a command center.
[1:43:43.300 --> 1:43:47.060]  Did you hear about my reporters got there Wednesday night, went and tried to talk to
[1:43:47.060 --> 1:43:51.460]  the military and then they said that they ran and were maybe terrorist and so they put
[1:43:51.460 --> 1:43:55.500]  them in databases and I called the cops and they admitted it. I mean, these are sick of
[1:43:55.500 --> 1:43:59.700]  us. Oh, yeah, I mean, and that's the thing is the National Security Special Event. It's
[1:43:59.700 --> 1:44:05.460]  very clear that the normal, you know, supposed restrictions of constitutional government get
[1:44:05.460 --> 1:44:11.380]  thrown out the window and you have paramilitary operations. I mean, the thing with an NSFB
[1:44:11.380 --> 1:44:16.140]  is that there's so many different organizations involved and it's totally kind of a collectivist
[1:44:16.140 --> 1:44:19.820]  or no one's ever really responsible for any of the actions that are going on. It's a mass
[1:44:19.820 --> 1:44:24.740]  bully feeding event. Yeah, you get to beat up young good looking girls and hey, did you
[1:44:24.740 --> 1:44:28.820]  ever want to attack an old lady with shopping bags coming out of a shop with a police dog?
[1:44:28.820 --> 1:44:33.020]  This is your chance. You want to be a Nazi? This is your chance. Yeah, and the police
[1:44:33.020 --> 1:44:37.780]  are totally anonymized. Like I filmed numerous, they were supposed to supposedly all be wearing
[1:44:37.780 --> 1:44:41.940]  armbands. Secret police. Undercover. Yeah, but they're not wearing armbands. You can't
[1:44:41.940 --> 1:44:45.860]  tell their identities quite apart from the undercover provocateurs, even the regular
[1:44:45.860 --> 1:44:49.780]  police. You can't find their armbands. They come from, you know, Palm Beach County. They
[1:44:49.780 --> 1:44:54.740]  come from like Louisville. They come from across the country to do this stuff and they're
[1:44:54.740 --> 1:44:58.620]  not really held accountable for anything they do. It's like a big deer hunting event. It's
[1:44:58.620 --> 1:45:01.980]  like a big deal. I mean, I've seen the Miami police who were there shoot a woman in the
[1:45:01.980 --> 1:45:06.940]  face with a rubber bullet for no reason and then laugh about it afterwards at the debriefing
[1:45:06.940 --> 1:45:11.300]  famous video of the Miami police from the World Trade Organization. But expanding on
[1:45:11.300 --> 1:45:16.300]  that, I'm sure you've seen the video of the men and fatigues in a champagne police car
[1:45:16.300 --> 1:45:21.460]  grabbing somebody and dragging and then G 20 said, well, those were private contractors.
[1:45:21.460 --> 1:45:26.460]  Have you found out who they were? Yeah, that's a very good question. We I did personally
[1:45:26.460 --> 1:45:31.460]  film another snatch squad that looked pretty similar. Um, and, uh, you know, there were
[1:45:31.460 --> 1:45:34.820]  just snatch squads roaming around all over the place. That was another question we had
[1:45:34.820 --> 1:45:39.620]  from the RNC as well as to what extent private security can do these kinds of things. So
[1:45:39.620 --> 1:45:44.580]  snatch squads, tell me about the snatch squads. Well, you know, it's just like you never
[1:45:44.580 --> 1:45:48.740]  knew when people would either, you know, they would just pop up and just basically grab
[1:45:48.740 --> 1:45:52.340]  people. I mean, I was on a bridge and then all of a sudden a bunch of guys jumped out
[1:45:52.340 --> 1:45:56.420]  of a squad van and just dragged this kid right off and I happened to get put into that because
[1:45:56.420 --> 1:46:00.500]  I was right there and already filming. But, um, you know, it's just, it's a sense of fear.
[1:46:00.500 --> 1:46:05.380]  You know, it's basically trauma-based behavior modification. That's always kind of in fact,
[1:46:05.380 --> 1:46:09.780]  dad, if you're a political candidate, even for high office who doesn't play ball, they
[1:46:09.780 --> 1:46:13.300]  admittedly just snatch you off the street, put a bag over your head and murder you.
[1:46:13.300 --> 1:46:17.700]  So they, yeah, I mean, these are murder teams. Yeah. Speaking of bags over the head, I have
[1:46:17.700 --> 1:46:23.340]  to tell you, um, uh, a young man, um, from Minneapolis who was videotaping with us, Nathan
[1:46:23.340 --> 1:46:28.860]  Monkelin, um, he was picked up really close to, uh, Luke Radkowski down there on Friday
[1:46:28.860 --> 1:46:32.660]  night when they were, you know, assaulting everybody down at the Cathedral of Learning
[1:46:32.660 --> 1:46:37.820]  in Pittsburgh. And, uh, they, uh, stuck him with two assault charges instead of eight
[1:46:37.820 --> 1:46:43.420]  back, uh, sorry, set his bail at $8,000 and with two assault felonies, he was videotaping
[1:46:43.420 --> 1:46:47.100]  and the video evidence that he was taping would clearly show, you know, the kind of
[1:46:47.100 --> 1:46:51.100]  police brutality that was going on. And so I think we finally got his bail lower down
[1:46:51.100 --> 1:46:55.980]  to 800 bucks, but I think he's going to be out later today. But, um, because they pretty
[1:46:55.980 --> 1:47:00.140]  much needed to stick someone from out of state with some felonies, they, uh, claimed
[1:47:00.140 --> 1:47:03.900]  that he was spitting and they did put the bag over his head. And then, you know, apparently
[1:47:03.900 --> 1:47:07.700]  the FBI was thrilling him and all this weird stuff when, when they were being processed.
[1:47:07.700 --> 1:47:11.700]  Well, Luke Radkowski said that they stripped him down. He didn't tell the whole story
[1:47:11.700 --> 1:47:16.020]  on air as it's embarrassing, made fun of his private parts, basically. They did that.
[1:47:16.020 --> 1:47:21.340]  They took my guys to the bathroom, made fun of their, made fun of, do, uh, they then beat
[1:47:21.340 --> 1:47:26.340]  him with batons and said, this is happening because you were a TV star. And he said the
[1:47:26.340 --> 1:47:28.700]  army was doing this with the FBI.
[1:47:28.700 --> 1:47:33.500]  Yes. Yes. Yes. We do know that the military was all over the detention facility. Apart
[1:47:33.500 --> 1:47:36.500]  from that, you know, it's just, it's simply an issue of like, well, you know, what's
[1:47:36.500 --> 1:47:40.500]  the legal transparency here? Under what authority are these people operating? That's really
[1:47:40.500 --> 1:47:46.060]  the big question. I mean, that is, that is really a core, core question. Um, one thing
[1:47:46.060 --> 1:47:50.500]  I want to point out is that we need to know if any of these army units were under, uh,
[1:47:50.500 --> 1:47:56.020]  army regulations three, eight, one dash 10, which is US army intelligence directives,
[1:47:56.020 --> 1:47:59.500]  which includes like what they're allowed to do is domestic intelligence. We don't know
[1:47:59.500 --> 1:48:03.980]  kind of, if you will, the legal framework or the operating system of all these different
[1:48:03.980 --> 1:48:05.780]  units doing all these different things.
[1:48:05.780 --> 1:48:06.780]  But here's an example.
[1:48:06.780 --> 1:48:09.580]  We're being conditioned to accept it. We're being conditioned to accept that this kind
[1:48:09.580 --> 1:48:12.680]  of operation shouldn't be questioned. You don't know what's going on. We're being
[1:48:12.680 --> 1:48:16.940]  acclimated, but let me throw this at you because you sound really informants refreshing. Here's
[1:48:16.940 --> 1:48:22.060]  an example three or four years ago, it happened in Houston and Denver. So Texas and Colorado,
[1:48:22.060 --> 1:48:25.460]  they would call up high school students and say, if you don't come sign the paperwork
[1:48:25.460 --> 1:48:31.180]  to join the army or Marines, I will put you in present. This is an order from the president.
[1:48:31.180 --> 1:48:37.460]  You are drafted. Now that was a total color of law lie. It was a fraud. Now I said at
[1:48:37.460 --> 1:48:41.300]  the time I said those men are following orders because it's the same script on the answering
[1:48:41.300 --> 1:48:44.500]  machines. They wouldn't be leaving this on an answering machine if they weren't being
[1:48:44.500 --> 1:48:50.900]  ordered to do it. The army said we will discipline them. They promoted both of the men to entire
[1:48:50.900 --> 1:48:53.540]  state level recruiting when they were caught.
[1:48:53.540 --> 1:48:54.540]  Of course.
[1:48:54.540 --> 1:48:58.980]  So the point is even their regulations are bad enough. That's for public consumption.
[1:48:58.980 --> 1:48:59.980]  Right.
[1:48:59.980 --> 1:49:01.980]  They have a real operating system.
[1:49:01.980 --> 1:49:07.300]  Yeah, absolutely. I also want to throw in really quickly that, you know, there were
[1:49:07.300 --> 1:49:11.580]  some raucous protests and there was some property destruction, but the police destroyed
[1:49:11.580 --> 1:49:16.300]  a huge amount of journalists property. They destroyed a ton of cameras, a ton of video
[1:49:16.300 --> 1:49:21.500]  cameras. They take everybody's tapes, anyone that they get. So whenever Nate gets out of
[1:49:21.500 --> 1:49:25.500]  there, I really, we're going to be lucky to even get our camera back, but it's almost
[1:49:25.500 --> 1:49:29.220]  a certainty that we certainly won't get the tape back. This is very systematic. This is
[1:49:29.220 --> 1:49:32.900]  because any single tape could hurt them in these lawsuits that are eventually going to
[1:49:32.900 --> 1:49:37.540]  come down. And that is part of the system. And, you know, no one's ever going to put
[1:49:37.540 --> 1:49:41.540]  the brakes on it. No elected officials going to say, Oh yeah, we can't keep stealing tapes.
[1:49:41.540 --> 1:49:45.620]  You know, so we're about to go to break and come back into one more segment with you on
[1:49:45.620 --> 1:49:48.180]  the provocateur cops breaking people's cameras.
[1:49:48.180 --> 1:49:49.180]  Sure.
[1:49:49.180 --> 1:49:54.020]  And this always gets confused. And I guess on purpose through a strawman argument, I'm
[1:49:54.020 --> 1:49:59.060]  not saying all anarchists are feds. What I'm saying is, is they've been caught in Denver,
[1:49:59.060 --> 1:50:01.580]  Denver Post. They've been caught in Ottawa.
[1:50:01.580 --> 1:50:05.540]  People in news reported that they've been caught in France. They've been caught in Germany.
[1:50:05.540 --> 1:50:11.340]  They've been caught working for the police. That is some of them or police dressed up
[1:50:11.340 --> 1:50:15.580]  like them. And then the anarchists always send me emails and post articles saying, I'm
[1:50:15.580 --> 1:50:20.700]  a liar. I'm saying all anarchists are feds. That's not what we're saying. Clearly they
[1:50:20.700 --> 1:50:25.500]  also linked in this latest article to your video and said it's made up. Those aren't
[1:50:25.500 --> 1:50:30.620]  cops. Those are them. Sounds like they're working for them. Sounds like the anarchists in this
[1:50:30.620 --> 1:50:32.300]  case are working for them.
[1:50:32.300 --> 1:50:36.260]  Well, people don't even believe this stuff is real. But it is real. And that's what people
[1:50:36.260 --> 1:50:41.780]  need to realize is that this stuff is happening and it was staged. Stuff is crazy. It was
[1:50:41.780 --> 1:50:43.500]  out here and it is for real happening.
[1:50:43.500 --> 1:50:47.780]  Yeah, they thought people were telling us it was fake that the men in uniforms weren't
[1:50:47.780 --> 1:50:53.780]  grabbing kids off the street. Now the G20 admits it. I mean, folks, there is video of
[1:50:53.780 --> 1:50:58.340]  old women coming out of shops being attacked by police dogs. This really happens. Stay
[1:50:58.340 --> 1:50:59.340]  there, Mr. Pipe.
[1:50:59.340 --> 1:51:01.580]  Thank you.

[1:52:06.700 --> 1:52:08.260]  was an inside job.
[1:52:08.260 --> 1:52:11.060]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:52:11.060 --> 1:52:15.700]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? It was engineered by you, David
[1:52:15.700 --> 1:52:18.420]  Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR.
[1:52:18.420 --> 1:52:20.300]  And they said I would shut up.
[1:52:20.300 --> 1:52:25.540]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[1:52:25.540 --> 1:52:27.220]  to grow at our own door.
[1:52:27.220 --> 1:52:33.300]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:52:33.300 --> 1:52:37.060]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:52:37.060 --> 1:52:40.060]  I don't think we're going to do this.
[1:52:40.060 --> 1:52:43.500]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:52:43.500 --> 1:52:46.300]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:52:46.300 --> 1:52:50.860]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th

[1:54:42.900 --> 1:54:45.740]  video and the different news reports you've been posting.
[1:54:45.740 --> 1:54:56.740]  Yeah, yeah, for sure. I'm with the Twin Cities Indy Media, so you can check that out at tc.indymedia.org.
[1:54:56.740 --> 1:55:05.620]  Our local Indy Media chapter, which has been terrific, they're great people, is at indypgh.org.
[1:55:05.620 --> 1:55:07.860]  My personal website is HongTong.com.
[1:55:07.860 --> 1:55:12.220]  All right, let me throw this at you, and then I want to talk about the provocateur cops.
[1:55:12.220 --> 1:55:15.860]  Clearly, cops have seen it over and over again. It's been admitted in other cities. This
[1:55:15.860 --> 1:55:16.860]  is not our opinion.
[1:55:16.860 --> 1:55:22.180]  The anarchists always do this straw man. If you criticize any of the violence, if you
[1:55:22.180 --> 1:55:26.420]  criticize cops dressed up like anarchists, if you hold up Denver Post admitting it,
[1:55:26.420 --> 1:55:31.420]  the police admitting it, they say it doesn't exist and we're liars, they then are now attacking
[1:55:31.420 --> 1:55:36.220]  your video, and our articles saying those aren't cops, that means they've got to be
[1:55:36.220 --> 1:55:39.220]  cops or something, even though I'm giving them benefit of the doubt and saying they're
[1:55:39.220 --> 1:55:44.860]  not all cops, if they're knowingly deceiving and attacking your video.
[1:55:44.860 --> 1:55:50.300]  Sure. Well, I guess what I would say is that, you know, you've got to have a balanced look
[1:55:50.300 --> 1:55:54.780]  and a good sensibility of this. Like, if you're out at the demonstration, there are certain
[1:55:54.780 --> 1:55:59.020]  people that just don't look right. There are young kids that get up in the black block
[1:55:59.020 --> 1:56:00.660]  and it's like they were not organized.
[1:56:00.660 --> 1:56:05.300]  But you've always got big, giant, muscled cops. They put the tough guys in and they're
[1:56:05.300 --> 1:56:08.060]  always wearing the same thing. I mean, give me a break.
[1:56:08.060 --> 1:56:12.060]  They always look wrong. They always just physically look wrong in every way. They're always too
[1:56:12.060 --> 1:56:16.860]  old and too big looking. And the thing is, you can interact with someone who is in a
[1:56:16.860 --> 1:56:21.140]  black block and they act kind of normal, but when you challenge someone who's an undercover,
[1:56:21.140 --> 1:56:25.500]  they act really weird. And I just want to say like, that's what our group has been doing
[1:56:25.500 --> 1:56:29.500]  is using tactical media to confront these people, get them out of marches so that they
[1:56:29.500 --> 1:56:30.500]  can't create provocation.
[1:56:30.500 --> 1:56:34.380]  Well, I want to talk about that, but at the Fortune 500 here in Austin in 99, I came over
[1:56:34.380 --> 1:56:38.740]  and confronted them and cops ran across the street in uniform and said, leave our officers
[1:56:38.740 --> 1:56:41.900]  alone and they pulled them out and put more in.
[1:56:41.900 --> 1:56:47.180]  Right. Yeah. And so basically, what the only thing you can do to defend people's constitutional
[1:56:47.180 --> 1:56:51.900]  freedoms and right of assembly is to just monitor things, like to challenge these guys
[1:56:51.900 --> 1:56:55.860]  that are up in this stuff. And, you know, and that applies as much as the organizational
[1:56:55.860 --> 1:57:00.260]  level of protesting as it does out on the streets, but you tell us briefly, push back.
[1:57:00.260 --> 1:57:03.940]  I'll have you back on because you're a great guest, but we're out of time. Briefly, tell
[1:57:03.940 --> 1:57:08.420]  me about the provocateurs this time and the cops breaking people's cameras in this video.
[1:57:08.420 --> 1:57:12.020]  Yeah, sure. I mean, basically, like it was just one of those things where the cops were
[1:57:12.020 --> 1:57:15.860]  definitely willing to break people's cameras upon when they were getting arrested. In this
[1:57:15.860 --> 1:57:21.580]  particular video before our camera guy got there, they broke off someone else's lens.
[1:57:21.580 --> 1:57:25.380]  You know, there were always just, you know, weird guys kind of hanging around on the edges
[1:57:25.380 --> 1:57:29.300]  of marches, especially in the back and that kind of thing. So you just got to mobilize
[1:57:29.300 --> 1:57:33.700]  people to have full, you know, situational awareness of what's going on because these
[1:57:33.700 --> 1:57:37.660]  people don't seem organic. Like you can tell that something's wrong with them and then
[1:57:37.660 --> 1:57:41.780]  you just have to, everyone has to work together and peacefully, you know, defend our constitutional
[1:57:41.780 --> 1:57:45.740]  rights and expose them and get them out of there because there's enough like uniform
[1:57:45.740 --> 1:57:49.300]  to police around to look after the safety or whatever. There's no reason for all these
[1:57:49.300 --> 1:57:51.980]  undercovers to invest everything, all that aren't right.
[1:57:51.980 --> 1:57:55.180]  Well, they're not very good undercovers. Their eyes are always jacked up.
[1:57:55.180 --> 1:57:58.140]  Same thing never are. That's the other thing. They always look wrong and I don't understand
[1:57:58.140 --> 1:57:59.460]  why they can't like, I don't think they can.
[1:57:59.460 --> 1:58:00.460]  No, they're afraid.
[1:58:00.460 --> 1:58:01.460]  I don't know.
[1:58:01.460 --> 1:58:04.780]  I mean, I mean, these guys are like a cat when it puffs up or a dog when it puffs up.
[1:58:04.780 --> 1:58:08.060]  Their eyes are all crazed. They're in there. I mean, that's weird.
[1:58:08.060 --> 1:58:12.780]  Yeah, absolutely. And you know, and the thing is also people need to realize all this intimidation,
[1:58:12.780 --> 1:58:16.860]  all these tactics, like it's what they call security theater. It's a lot of bluster. It's
[1:58:16.860 --> 1:58:19.020]  a lot of dudes like marching around looking tough.
[1:58:19.020 --> 1:58:22.460]  Well, that's why they beat on their, that's why they beat on their armor with the Billy
[1:58:22.460 --> 1:58:23.460]  clubs.
[1:58:23.460 --> 1:58:28.020]  Yes, absolutely. That was amazing. And that's the exact kind of like group psychology that
[1:58:28.020 --> 1:58:32.100]  and elite deviance really, when they all, when they are really all anonymized like that,
[1:58:32.100 --> 1:58:35.620]  when they feel they can act as a mob themselves, that's when our constitution.
[1:58:35.620 --> 1:58:42.620]  Yeah, they're the ones really being psychologically manipulated. Dan fight. Thank you so much.

[1:58:50.900 --> 1:58:55.020]  Hello friends. This is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[1:58:55.020 --> 1:59:00.020]  Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental
[1:59:00.020 --> 1:59:05.100]  auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking
[1:59:05.100 --> 1:59:09.220]  water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and
[1:59:09.220 --> 1:59:14.380]  developmental system diseases. Now what are you going to do about it? The Acola blue atmospheric
[1:59:14.380 --> 1:59:19.140]  water generator is a low cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking
[1:59:19.140 --> 1:59:24.180]  water. The Acola blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[1:59:24.180 --> 1:59:29.580]  and uses state of the art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis and ultra violent light sterilization
[1:59:29.580 --> 1:59:35.260]  techniques. That's right. Clean water right from the air you breathe. Order today by calling

[1:59:47.980 --> 2:00:05.660]  today at www.ecolovle.com. Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Big
[2:00:05.660 --> 2:00:14.300]  brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[2:00:14.300 --> 2:00:40.020]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:40.020 --> 2:00:48.580]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. We are now into the third hour today
[2:00:48.580 --> 2:00:51.180]  and Ted Anderson's joining us for the next five minutes and I'm going to get into more
[2:00:51.180 --> 2:00:57.780]  news and how I'm reportedly on the White House enemies list coming up. Right now going
[2:00:57.780 --> 2:01:04.020]  to Ted Anderson of Midas Resources. Ted Anderson, I wanted to get you up because gold has been
[2:01:04.020 --> 2:01:08.900]  gyrating back and forth and we have the stock market dropping right now and you have a great
[2:01:08.900 --> 2:01:12.820]  offer again for people today. Well, you know, it's really kind of funny,
[2:01:12.820 --> 2:01:20.180]  Alex. I mean, gold hit down there around the 988 level and I was buying, I picked up about
[2:01:20.180 --> 2:01:25.380]  a quarter of a million dollars with the gold at that point and here I am today adjusting
[2:01:25.380 --> 2:01:32.620]  my prices downward. I mean, I dropped the prices from on the Franks from 236 down to 233. British
[2:01:32.620 --> 2:01:39.020]  sovereigns came down to 288. They're at 291. The Lakota's, even though I was able to pick
[2:01:39.020 --> 2:01:45.740]  some up at the 16 level, I had to raise the price. So I just left that alone. But today
[2:01:45.740 --> 2:01:54.180]  gold is going up. It's up $17 already today up in the 1010 range and here I am dropping
[2:01:54.180 --> 2:01:58.820]  my prices. People are probably going to think I'm crazier some, but yeah, I was indeed able
[2:01:58.820 --> 2:02:03.060]  to take advantage of that nice little dip that we had there. I really liked those things.
[2:02:03.060 --> 2:02:07.460]  I mean, you know, it's like the Fed steps and they start selling the central banks are
[2:02:07.460 --> 2:02:13.460]  trying to manipulate the market. If you don't believe that's happening, just go to gata.org.
[2:02:13.460 --> 2:02:19.300]  Gata.org. You can see that they're actually in there's messing with the gold prices and
[2:02:19.300 --> 2:02:24.980]  hiding it for that matter. They won't disclose what they're doing. So there you go. So here
[2:02:24.980 --> 2:02:29.820]  I am buying in the marketplace, just knowing that the problems aren't solved in this country
[2:02:29.820 --> 2:02:33.860]  and that we're going to have more coming along and sure enough, gold jumps back up again.
[2:02:33.860 --> 2:02:37.860]  Unfortunately, people do slow down and they're buying when the prices are low. Obviously,
[2:02:37.860 --> 2:02:42.220]  I'm not charging enough or something. I don't know. But we are back and the gold market
[2:02:42.220 --> 2:02:46.580]  is going hot gangbusters. I've dropped my prices. I don't think there's a dealer out
[2:02:46.580 --> 2:02:50.220]  there in the United States that did that right now. But yeah, there are some really good
[2:02:50.220 --> 2:02:54.420]  buys at this point in time, Alex. And I just have to say, if you're thinking about gold
[2:02:54.420 --> 2:02:58.540]  at all, now's a good time to do it. You know, I mean, if you're the stock market, the bond
[2:02:58.540 --> 2:03:02.700]  market, I mean, where do you want to be? Even Robert Proctor is saying that you have to
[2:03:02.700 --> 2:03:08.300]  get the cash and he is talking about a complete meltdown. Well, who's cash do you trust? You
[2:03:08.300 --> 2:03:16.500]  know, gold has been money for 6,000 years. You know, the cash market, which is all fiat
[2:03:16.500 --> 2:03:20.900]  currency across the globe. I don't think you can trust anybody's currency anymore, but
[2:03:20.900 --> 2:03:24.620]  the Chinese are definitely wanting to get away from the dollar. They're proved that
[2:03:24.620 --> 2:03:27.940]  time and again. Well, Ted, tell folks about today's awesome
[2:03:27.940 --> 2:03:31.540]  offer. Well, today, the best thing that I have right now are going to be the Franks
[2:03:31.540 --> 2:03:35.180]  and the British sovereigns because I just dropped those coins down in price and gold
[2:03:35.180 --> 2:03:40.340]  just went up. I mean, you can't lose on that particular deal. I don't know how you could
[2:03:40.340 --> 2:03:45.620]  find a better deal than that. Certainly the silver walkers are still a great buy at 869.
[2:03:45.620 --> 2:03:49.060]  But you know, I'm just kind of slapping myself in the face going, why am I lowering these
[2:03:49.060 --> 2:03:54.020]  prices? Gold's running up like crazy. Well, anyways, I just want to say I was able to
[2:03:54.020 --> 2:04:01.100]  get them at a better price. I don't need to make a bigger margin. Just call us at 1-800-686-2237.
[2:04:01.100 --> 2:04:04.820]  If you're interested, just mention that you heard it on the Alex Jones show and that you're
[2:04:04.820 --> 2:04:09.740]  interested in the Alex Jones special. You know, Alex, I'm just watching the market.
[2:04:09.740 --> 2:04:13.620]  It's almost like clockwork. I mean, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that
[2:04:13.620 --> 2:04:18.220]  if you buy in the depths and sell on the rise, you're going to make money. It's so easy to
[2:04:18.220 --> 2:04:20.260]  do on this market. It's not even funny.
[2:04:20.260 --> 2:04:24.820]  Well, folks need to give the brokers a call. How long can you hold this deal, Ted?
[2:04:24.820 --> 2:04:29.180]  Well, I'm going to hold this deal until midnight, just like I already do. I mean, like I said,
[2:04:29.180 --> 2:04:34.740]  let me give them the numbers. We're almost out of time. 800-686-2237. Gold is way up
[2:04:34.740 --> 2:04:44.820]  right now. You're selling it at the lower price. Win, win, win. 800-686-2237. 800-686-2237.
[2:04:44.820 --> 2:04:49.500]  The brokers are there right now. Folks, get out of the fiat dollars while you still can.
[2:04:49.500 --> 2:04:59.500]  800-686-2237. Gold is more than triple. Since 2001, what other investment has? 800-686-2237.
[2:04:59.500 --> 2:05:00.740]  Stay with us.
[2:05:00.740 --> 2:05:05.060]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power? If so, this is
[2:05:05.060 --> 2:05:08.860]  going to be the most important message you will ever hear. Solar power generators are
[2:05:08.860 --> 2:05:13.220]  now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois. These emergency backup
[2:05:13.220 --> 2:05:18.060]  systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most. Unlike gas generators,
[2:05:18.060 --> 2:05:23.180]  a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free. It's like
[2:05:23.180 --> 2:05:28.060]  having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home. Run some pumps, short-wave
[2:05:28.060 --> 2:05:33.220]  radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling. Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms,
[2:05:33.220 --> 2:05:37.980]  brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:05:37.980 --> 2:05:42.500]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready. With a solar-powered generator from Solutions
[2:05:42.500 --> 2:05:50.580]  from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today. That's mysolarbackup.com

[2:06:57.420 --> 2:07:05.660]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle
[2:07:05.660 --> 2:07:10.100]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would
[2:07:10.100 --> 2:07:15.260]  be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is
[2:07:15.260 --> 2:07:20.380]  your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle
[2:07:20.380 --> 2:07:24.260]  starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there
[2:07:24.260 --> 2:07:28.780]  be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed
[2:07:28.780 --> 2:07:33.780]  yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[2:07:33.780 --> 2:07:38.820]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your
[2:07:38.820 --> 2:07:43.780]  life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm
[2:07:43.780 --> 2:07:52.180]  Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[2:07:52.180 --> 2:08:02.420]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[2:08:02.420 --> 2:08:14.020]  Please the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:14.020 --> 2:08:19.580]  Well the Associated Press and Politico have both reported in the last month that Obama
[2:08:19.580 --> 2:08:25.220]  has an enemies list. We know Bill Clinton had one. Now the Globe, which is about as
[2:08:25.220 --> 2:08:29.620]  good as the Inquirer, though they don't do Bat Boy and Aliens Landing in Central Park,
[2:08:29.620 --> 2:08:33.780]  they claim that they have a White House source with the enemies list. I think this is a public
[2:08:33.780 --> 2:08:40.940]  threat to people. And we're going to be going over that after Ray McGovern leaves us. Ray
[2:08:40.940 --> 2:08:46.940]  McGovern is one of President Ronald Reagan's intelligence briefers from 81 to 85. He was
[2:08:46.940 --> 2:08:51.580]  in charge of the Preparing the Daily Security Briefings for Reagan and Vice President George
[2:08:51.580 --> 2:08:57.140]  Herbert Walker Bush and the National Security Advisor, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a Cabinet.
[2:08:57.140 --> 2:09:01.380]  Ray McGovern was one of several senior CIA analysts who prepared the President's Daily
[2:09:01.380 --> 2:09:09.060]  Briefing during the first Bush administration. He also famously challenged then Defense Secretary
[2:09:09.060 --> 2:09:16.500]  Donald Rumsfeld at a press conference. Where are the WMDs? And of course the Defense Secretary
[2:09:16.500 --> 2:09:23.100]  said, I never said they had WMDs. And he quoted Rumsfeld back and really devastated Rumsfeld.
[2:09:23.100 --> 2:09:28.620]  And that was really a turning point because Rumsfeld had been saying they had the WMDs
[2:09:28.620 --> 2:09:33.380]  and where they were in and around to Crete. Then he had to back off. So I really respect
[2:09:33.380 --> 2:09:39.180]  Ray McGovern's analysis. He was also an infantry commander during the Vietnam era as well and
[2:09:39.180 --> 2:09:44.500]  the Army of Memory serves correctly. And he's been two years in remission from lymphatic
[2:09:44.500 --> 2:09:49.740]  cancer, so we're excited to have him here with us and doing better than ever. Joining
[2:09:49.740 --> 2:09:55.820]  us is Ray McGovern. Ray, good to have you here with us. Thank you, Alex. Ray, from
[2:09:55.820 --> 2:10:00.260]  memory, don't you have a new book out too? Well, I don't write books because then I
[2:10:00.260 --> 2:10:05.180]  lose my wife. I learned somebody saying they heard you on Dallas Radio about a book or
[2:10:05.180 --> 2:10:08.460]  something. Maybe you were talking about somebody else's book. Oh, I was. Yeah, I was talking
[2:10:08.460 --> 2:10:15.420]  about JFK and the Unspeakable, which is a book that people really should read. It's
[2:10:15.420 --> 2:10:24.420]  by James Douglas and it goes over the very, the most recently released data on the situation
[2:10:24.420 --> 2:10:32.460]  there in Dallas and elsewhere. When John Kennedy was assassinated. You know, I had dinner with
[2:10:32.460 --> 2:10:38.220]  Martin Sheen about a month ago and he said it was the best JFK book he had read and was
[2:10:38.220 --> 2:10:41.980]  raving about it. And I forgot to get a copy of it. He was going to give me a copy of it,
[2:10:41.980 --> 2:10:46.220]  but I forgot to get it. Why is everybody saying this book is so powerful? I mean, you're a
[2:10:46.220 --> 2:10:52.420]  former top CIA analyst reading it yourself. I want to get into Iran, but that's a subject
[2:10:52.420 --> 2:10:58.580]  I never raised with you is JFK. Why are you so impressed with this book? Well, Alex, I
[2:10:58.580 --> 2:11:03.260]  have to confess that someone sent me that book about a year and a half ago. And as soon
[2:11:03.260 --> 2:11:10.660]  as I heard that it had this theory that it was the CIA, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
[2:11:10.660 --> 2:11:17.260]  people who had been subordinated to the Secret Service that planned and executed the assassination
[2:11:17.260 --> 2:11:21.300]  of John Kennedy. As soon as I heard that, I said, well, this is pretty far out. I got
[2:11:21.300 --> 2:11:26.740]  lots of articles to write. I put it on my back shelf, but recently I've been reading
[2:11:26.740 --> 2:11:33.180]  it. I've almost finished. And I share the view of those who have read it before and
[2:11:33.180 --> 2:11:40.340]  told me that it's the most painstakingly researched piece of work and that it includes the very
[2:11:40.340 --> 2:11:46.780]  latest data that's been released from FOIAs or from other things. He conducted incredible
[2:11:46.780 --> 2:11:53.460]  interviews with people on the spot. And the evidence that he adduces, and I'm an intelligence
[2:11:53.460 --> 2:11:59.700]  analyst, so I know a little bit about this kind of thing, is very, very persuasive. And
[2:11:59.700 --> 2:12:09.100]  the reason that it has such current attention and applicability is because the very forces
[2:12:09.100 --> 2:12:19.740]  that Jim Douglas claims did JFK and are still very much around, are still very much intimidating
[2:12:19.740 --> 2:12:26.100]  a new president, whose name happens to be Barack Obama. And if you just run down the
[2:12:26.100 --> 2:12:35.820]  line of things, it was Cuba, mostly, because JFK would not save the abortive day of pigs
[2:12:35.820 --> 2:12:43.700]  invasion in 1961. The CIA and the Joint Chiefs got very mad about that. When JFK wouldn't
[2:12:43.700 --> 2:12:52.980]  launch a nuclear war on the Soviet Union during the missile crisis in 62, that got the Joint
[2:12:52.980 --> 2:12:58.100]  Chiefs really mad because they knew they had the advantage. And they told, look, Mr. President,
[2:12:58.100 --> 2:13:02.020]  it would only mean about 20 million of us killed, but we killed all the Russians. That
[2:13:02.020 --> 2:13:07.580]  kind of logic. That was L. L. Limitzer and Curtis LeMay, wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah, it was
[2:13:07.580 --> 2:13:14.060]  the, yeah, it was that crowd. That crowd was described by George Ball, the deputy secretary
[2:13:14.060 --> 2:13:19.820]  of state, as a cesspool. They're the ones that planned things like Northwoods and other
[2:13:19.820 --> 2:13:25.380]  things. So the primary, it's hard to put yourself back into those years, but there was such
[2:13:25.380 --> 2:13:32.380]  an incredible visceral, knee-jerk, anti-communism that, again, the Joint Chiefs thought it'd
[2:13:32.380 --> 2:13:37.980]  be just fine if we did involve the Soviet Union in return to just, you know, maybe 20
[2:13:37.980 --> 2:13:44.660]  million casualties here. John Kennedy faced into that, and not only that, but he started
[2:13:44.660 --> 2:13:51.220]  talking with Castro independently and secretly. He thought, of course, the CIA knew about
[2:13:51.220 --> 2:13:57.540]  it, and he had a private correspondence with Nikita Khrushchev. He made a big speech at
[2:13:57.540 --> 2:14:02.620]  American University saying, we ought to get along with the Soviet Union. What do you know,
[2:14:02.620 --> 2:14:09.420]  but three months later, the limited test fair treaty is signed. The JCS, the Joint Chiefs
[2:14:09.420 --> 2:14:15.540]  of Staff, was cut out of those negotiations. So you can understand how they felt about
[2:14:15.540 --> 2:14:21.460]  that. And last, but not least, was Vietnam, where John Kennedy was convinced it was a
[2:14:21.460 --> 2:14:27.140]  fool's errand, and he could not convince the Joint Chiefs nor his immediate advisors
[2:14:27.140 --> 2:14:34.020]  like McNamara and Rusk. And so he had to sort of surreptitiously move toward removing all
[2:14:34.020 --> 2:14:39.820]  our troops. And before he died, he ordered that the first 1,000 troops be brought home
[2:14:39.820 --> 2:14:45.660]  before the end of the year 63. And he started issuing U.S. greenbacks and was beginning
[2:14:45.660 --> 2:14:51.180]  to phase out the Federal Reserve and giving anti-Federal Reserve speeches.
[2:14:51.180 --> 2:14:55.940]  Yeah, he was running into lots of problems. And you know, when Dwight Eisenhower warned
[2:14:55.940 --> 2:15:02.940]  about the military industrial complex, well, already what he was seeing was a military
[2:15:02.940 --> 2:15:09.940]  industrial congressional media complex, which we have in full swing right now. And so he's
[2:15:09.940 --> 2:15:14.300]  really up against it. And so I admire him even more than I used to in facing right into
[2:15:14.300 --> 2:15:21.500]  that. And it's not at all difficult for me to believe anymore that the people who both
[2:15:21.500 --> 2:15:27.380]  felt personally threatened and also felt that this fellow was selling out to the communists,
[2:15:27.380 --> 2:15:32.820]  took it upon themselves to plan this thing, carry it off, and then appoint people to a
[2:15:32.820 --> 2:15:39.300]  sophisticated end quotes who would come out with the right conclusion, the politically
[2:15:39.300 --> 2:15:47.100]  correct conclusion that this Lee Harvey Oswald did it all alone. No one believes that anymore.
[2:15:47.100 --> 2:15:54.380]  So yeah, the applicability of this thing with his Barack Obama, his big, deribbed and
[2:15:54.380 --> 2:16:02.260]  be meddled general officers are telling him, oh, we're going to suffer defeat in Afghanistan
[2:16:02.260 --> 2:16:08.780]  if you don't give us 40, 45,000 more troops. That's exactly the same situation that JFK
[2:16:08.780 --> 2:16:09.780]  faced.
[2:16:09.780 --> 2:16:13.740]  What about the secret Pentagon document that came out two weeks ago? Is there any validity
[2:16:13.740 --> 2:16:18.420]  to that from your research, Ray McGovern, where they're saying they need 500,000 troops
[2:16:18.420 --> 2:16:19.820]  over the next five years?
[2:16:19.820 --> 2:16:25.740]  Well, you know, Andrea Mitchell ran with that. And I was really surprised because all the
[2:16:25.740 --> 2:16:33.220]  information that subsequently emerged does not indicate that that document talked about
[2:16:33.220 --> 2:16:41.060]  500,000. What I think people did, perhaps, was interpolate. They look at the ratio that
[2:16:41.060 --> 2:16:47.140]  the current Army manual says the ratio of troops to citizens that is necessary for
[2:16:47.140 --> 2:16:54.340]  successful insurgency, and you multiply the numbers by the 38 million Afghans, and you
[2:16:54.340 --> 2:16:57.780]  get, you know, 500,000 or more troops that would be...
[2:16:57.780 --> 2:17:03.180]  Yeah, that was the original Secretary White told Bush, you need 500,000 or 450,000 to
[2:17:03.180 --> 2:17:08.340]  be technical. And Bush said, no, I can do it with 150. And I guess they're 23 million
[2:17:08.340 --> 2:17:12.260]  in Iraq, so the ratio would be above 500,000, wouldn't it?
[2:17:12.260 --> 2:17:18.300]  Exactly right. And when you say 23 million in Iraq, I have to tell your listeners that
[2:17:18.300 --> 2:17:26.220]  there used to be 27 million in Iraq. That's not to say 4 million were killed, but 4 million
[2:17:26.220 --> 2:17:32.020]  have been displaced. A billion, I believe, have been killed. And you have many millions,
[2:17:32.020 --> 2:17:39.340]  2 million living internally as refugees, and 2.5 million living in a jointed state.
[2:17:39.340 --> 2:17:43.300]  Remigabar shifting gears. I want to... In the 40 minutes we have left with you, I want
[2:17:43.300 --> 2:17:46.940]  to get your... I mean, this is what you briefed the President's on. You are an expert on these
[2:17:46.940 --> 2:17:51.780]  regions and talk to the other experts who are specifically specialists in these areas.
[2:17:51.780 --> 2:17:56.620]  The geopolitical setup. They're now admitting that Russia did not sneak attack. Georgia
[2:17:56.620 --> 2:18:01.140]  was the other way around. Obama is doing the right thing, saying he's going to pull missile
[2:18:01.140 --> 2:18:04.860]  systems out, but then he's hedging his bets from what I've seen, saying maybe some new
[2:18:04.860 --> 2:18:12.980]  system down the road. So what you see happening in Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, the U.S.-Russian
[2:18:12.980 --> 2:18:17.340]  relationship, and where all this is going, and then, of course, the $64 million question
[2:18:17.340 --> 2:18:22.340]  I want to cover first, from what I've read, the Iranians said, okay, in a few months we're
[2:18:22.340 --> 2:18:27.060]  going to open this new facility. They announced it. Our media spun it and said, we found a
[2:18:27.060 --> 2:18:33.060]  secret location, and it looks to me like another big lie, or am I incorrect?
[2:18:33.060 --> 2:18:43.580]  Well, unfortunately, you're correct, Alex. What we have here is Iraq, part two. You remember
[2:18:43.580 --> 2:18:50.420]  how the, what I call the fawning corporate media, how they spun Iraq. So we're all led
[2:18:50.420 --> 2:18:54.460]  to believe that there were weapons of mass destruction there and ties between Saddam
[2:18:54.460 --> 2:19:00.460]  Hussein and al-Qaeda. None of that was right. And none of the hype that's going on now with
[2:19:00.460 --> 2:19:08.100]  respect to the, quote, Iranian nuclear threat, end quote, is right. It's hyperbole to the
[2:19:08.100 --> 2:19:13.540]  end of the degree, and people in Congress in particular are feeding, having a feeding
[2:19:13.540 --> 2:19:18.860]  frenzy on things that they have so war that the American citizen can't really understand
[2:19:18.860 --> 2:19:19.860]  what's going on.
[2:19:19.860 --> 2:19:20.860]  Okay.
[2:19:20.860 --> 2:19:21.860]  Try to put it in some context.
[2:19:21.860 --> 2:19:25.900]  Okay, do that after we go to break. We're going to come back. I'm going to give you the floor.
[2:19:25.900 --> 2:19:30.180]  I want you to break this down, because I remember two and a half weeks ago the Iranians
[2:19:30.180 --> 2:19:36.100]  have got all these different sites. They had the UN admits it can't get uranium above 95%
[2:19:36.100 --> 2:19:41.660]  to make weapons. The Iranians announced, here's a new site we've got. And then the media hoaxes
[2:19:41.660 --> 2:19:47.820]  it saying they've got it. It was secret. We found it. Boy, we better attack them. Netanyahu
[2:19:47.820 --> 2:19:53.140]  is making secret trips to Russia to get green light. Russia starts saying we support sanctions.
[2:19:53.140 --> 2:19:57.020]  What's your intel? Does that mean Russia is going to back an attack? We'll talk about
[2:19:57.020 --> 2:20:02.060]  it all with Ram a govern straight ahead. Stay with us.

[2:21:04.220 --> 2:21:08.500]  to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with
[2:21:08.500 --> 2:21:13.940]  taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced
[2:21:13.940 --> 2:21:18.580]  to live below the poverty line. Is this a flaw for enterprise, or is our monetary unit we
[2:21:18.580 --> 2:21:23.020]  call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation, and higher
[2:21:23.020 --> 2:21:27.540]  taxes? These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The
[2:21:27.540 --> 2:21:31.660]  Creature from Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American

[2:24:10.060 --> 2:24:15.340]  Well we have the former senior CIA analyst, Ray McGovern, whose information has proven
[2:24:15.340 --> 2:24:19.300]  over the years to be very, very accurate in hindsight, joining us. Okay, Ray, you were
[2:24:19.300 --> 2:24:24.220]  getting into what's really happening with Iran and the sites and what you agreed is
[2:24:24.220 --> 2:24:29.020]  a big hoax saying that it was a secret site and they're going to nuke us in 45 minutes
[2:24:29.020 --> 2:24:33.100]  changing the last letter in Iraq to Iran.
[2:24:33.100 --> 2:24:39.700]  Well you got it, Alex. That's what's going on. It's a type that's really unconscionable.
[2:24:39.700 --> 2:24:46.420]  Let me go back a little ways here because after the debacle on Iraq when my former colleagues
[2:24:46.420 --> 2:24:54.740]  were visited several times by the vice president, his name is Cheney, and told to write a National
[2:24:54.740 --> 2:25:00.820]  Intelligence Estimate that said Saddam Hussein has all manner of weapons of mass destruction.
[2:25:00.820 --> 2:25:10.340]  That was October 1, 2002. After that happened, my former colleagues rose to the occasion
[2:25:10.340 --> 2:25:13.780]  and said, no more of that stuff. We're not going to do that anymore. We're going to tell
[2:25:13.780 --> 2:25:18.820]  the truth, which reverts back to the kind of atmosphere in which I worked. The only place
[2:25:18.820 --> 2:25:23.660]  in town without a political agenda, the only place in town they can tell the president
[2:25:23.660 --> 2:25:30.660]  without fear or favor, what we really think. Now to make that clear, when people say, well
[2:25:30.660 --> 2:25:37.340]  how come you torture people, they're basically two CIAs. The one that obeys the president's
[2:25:37.340 --> 2:25:43.900]  wishes and is able to do that under the National Security Act 1947, the one that goes off and
[2:25:43.900 --> 2:25:50.380]  kidnaps people and tortures people. That's not the CIA. I worked in the analysis part
[2:25:50.380 --> 2:25:57.380]  and the part of the covert agency that collected information. What I'm talking about now is
[2:25:57.380 --> 2:26:06.380]  that CIA. Now what do we do? What did my former colleagues do? What we did, I have to point
[2:26:06.380 --> 2:26:21.180]  a phrase, is in 2006 we gave Bush and Cheney the finger, Tom finger, F-I-N-G-A-R, who was
[2:26:21.180 --> 2:26:27.340]  an honest estimator, incredibly bright, came from the State Department and ran an estimate
[2:26:27.340 --> 2:26:35.700]  on Iran in its nuclear program, which is a bottom-up estimate. They spent months and
[2:26:35.700 --> 2:26:41.340]  months and months re-looking at all the previous work, taking into account the most recent
[2:26:41.340 --> 2:26:47.140]  information. They came up with some startling conclusions, conclusions that were a direct
[2:26:47.140 --> 2:26:52.420]  variance with what President and Cheney had been telling the world, okay? Number one,
[2:26:52.420 --> 2:27:00.020]  the NIE judged with, quote, high confidence, end quote, that Iran had halted, had stopped
[2:27:00.020 --> 2:27:09.080]  a covert nuclear weapons program in the fall of 2003, and had not resumed work on this
[2:27:09.080 --> 2:27:14.900]  nuclear weapons aspect of its program. This is an essential part of a nuclear program.
[2:27:14.900 --> 2:27:20.420]  They stopped work on it, and the latest briefing of Congress indicates that the CIA believes
[2:27:20.420 --> 2:27:25.260]  in the intelligence community as well, that they did not restart this. So this is a very
[2:27:25.260 --> 2:27:32.860]  curious way to be, as Defense Secretary Gates says, hell bent on developing a nuclear weapon
[2:27:32.860 --> 2:27:36.860]  if you stopped. Let's see, what's the math here? Six years ago, okay?
[2:27:36.860 --> 2:27:43.220]  And, sir, didn't they say at the time in the highly publicized report that if Iran restarted
[2:27:43.220 --> 2:27:45.100]  it, it would take nine years?
[2:27:45.100 --> 2:27:52.940]  Oh, well, they said 2015 or so, it was a kind of a bracketed thing, and it all depended
[2:27:52.940 --> 2:28:00.420]  on how quickly they could enrich uranium to the weapons grade, and also what kind of delivery
[2:28:00.420 --> 2:28:09.260]  system they could get. Now, no one, no one from a technical point of view said that Iran
[2:28:09.260 --> 2:28:15.020]  could be a threat to the United States at any time frame soon. They have no ICBMs. They
[2:28:15.020 --> 2:28:22.660]  have no method of delivering a weapon even if they restarted their work on weapons. To
[2:28:22.660 --> 2:28:30.140]  whom are they a threat? Well, there's one other country in that region who actually
[2:28:30.140 --> 2:28:39.500]  has about 200, some people say 300 nuclear weapons, deliverable by aircraft, by submarines,
[2:28:39.500 --> 2:28:46.860]  by surface ships, by missile, and the name of that country is Israel. And no one should
[2:28:46.860 --> 2:28:53.740]  shy away from mentioning that because that is the fly in the ointment. If there's a country
[2:28:53.740 --> 2:29:02.300]  in that region that has no, has not signed a non-proliferation agreement and has this
[2:29:02.300 --> 2:29:08.060]  kind of capability, and the United States shows itself willing to invade a country like
[2:29:08.060 --> 2:29:13.460]  Iraq without that capability, well, if I were an Iranian, you know, I would think long and
[2:29:13.460 --> 2:29:19.540]  hard about being able to have the option to have that capability. And so this estimate,
[2:29:19.540 --> 2:29:26.420]  this estimate said, we don't know whether the Iranians would develop a nuclear weapon,
[2:29:26.420 --> 2:29:33.500]  but the evidence is not there. We will know in great time, in enough time, to know and
[2:29:33.500 --> 2:29:40.420]  take precautions and get them to negotiate. But the bottom line is there is time to negotiate.
[2:29:40.420 --> 2:29:45.620]  Long segment coming up. We'll continue there. Look at the latest hype. Iran announces they've
[2:29:45.620 --> 2:29:50.580]  got a facility. The media spends it and says we found a secret facility. We've got to attack.
[2:29:50.580 --> 2:29:57.340]  We'll be right back. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN
[2:29:57.340 --> 2:30:04.220]  radio network. Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself
[2:30:04.220 --> 2:30:08.700]  this question. Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted
[2:30:08.700 --> 2:30:13.620]  by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are
[2:30:13.620 --> 2:30:18.260]  present in municipal drinking water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer,
[2:30:18.260 --> 2:30:22.740]  reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases. Now, what are you going to do about
[2:30:22.740 --> 2:30:27.820]  it? The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of

[2:33:24.020 --> 2:33:28.020]  Going back to Ray McGovern in just one moment as we continue
[2:33:28.020 --> 2:33:31.020]  To get a briefing from him, honored to have him
[2:33:31.020 --> 2:33:33.020]  On what's really going on
[2:33:33.020 --> 2:33:37.020]  And he's one of the main people that came out and said the WMD thing is all a lie in Iraq
[2:33:37.020 --> 2:33:42.020]  The yellow tubes, or the aluminum tubes, the yellow cake from Niger, all of it
[2:33:42.020 --> 2:33:45.020]  And then now we know in hindsight it was all lies
[2:33:45.020 --> 2:33:47.020]  And they literally are running the same playbook again
[2:33:47.020 --> 2:33:49.020]  We'll talk to Ray McGovern in a moment
[2:33:49.020 --> 2:33:53.020]  Also talk about Russia, talk about Afghanistan, Pakistan
[2:33:53.020 --> 2:33:55.020]  And to get his view on where all that is going
[2:33:55.020 --> 2:33:57.020]  Before we do that, I want to remind listeners

[2:34:07.020 --> 2:34:09.020]  How they've mesmerized the population
[2:34:09.020 --> 2:34:11.020]  How they're recruiting Stasi forces
[2:34:11.020 --> 2:34:14.020]  Within the United States, it's all documented
[2:34:14.020 --> 2:34:16.020]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss

[2:35:04.020 --> 2:35:06.020]  Okay, going back to Ray McGovern
[2:35:06.020 --> 2:35:08.020]  Ray, you left off with the CIA assessment
[2:35:08.020 --> 2:35:10.020]  2006
[2:35:10.020 --> 2:35:13.020]  And then now we fast forward
[2:35:13.020 --> 2:35:15.020]  To they've taken some troops out of Iraq
[2:35:15.020 --> 2:35:17.020]  Replaced them with contractors
[2:35:17.020 --> 2:35:21.020]  Put 20-30,000 more troops and contractors
[2:35:21.020 --> 2:35:24.020]  In Afghanistan, they're saying on the news
[2:35:24.020 --> 2:35:26.020]  We caught a secret nuke factory
[2:35:26.020 --> 2:35:28.020]  We caught them, we caught them
[2:35:28.020 --> 2:35:30.020]  It's incredible, and then a few days later
[2:35:30.020 --> 2:35:32.020]  Oh, did we catch them?
[2:35:32.020 --> 2:35:35.020]  Well, they made the announcement after they knew we knew
[2:35:35.020 --> 2:35:38.020]  So break down what's really happening today
[2:35:38.020 --> 2:35:44.020]  Yeah, well, we caught them several months ago
[2:35:44.020 --> 2:35:48.020]  Alex and they announced the existence
[2:35:48.020 --> 2:35:51.020]  Of this new enrichment plant
[2:35:51.020 --> 2:35:53.020]  On their own initiative
[2:35:53.020 --> 2:35:56.020]  And they did that just a week before
[2:35:56.020 --> 2:35:58.020]  The negotiations started
[2:35:58.020 --> 2:36:00.020]  Your listeners perhaps need to be reminded
[2:36:00.020 --> 2:36:02.020]  That tomorrow is a very big day
[2:36:02.020 --> 2:36:05.020]  Because the five security council members
[2:36:05.020 --> 2:36:08.020]  Plus Germany and Iran are getting together
[2:36:08.020 --> 2:36:12.020]  To talk about the Iranian nuclear program
[2:36:12.020 --> 2:36:16.020]  Now, that's why the hype is the pitch that it is
[2:36:16.020 --> 2:36:19.020]  They're trying to, the media here
[2:36:19.020 --> 2:36:21.020]  Are trying to hype this thing up
[2:36:21.020 --> 2:36:23.020]  And say, well, look, now we've discovered
[2:36:23.020 --> 2:36:25.020]  A new enrichment facility
[2:36:25.020 --> 2:36:27.020]  Well, we know about that enrichment facility
[2:36:27.020 --> 2:36:30.020]  For four months, and now the Iranians
[2:36:30.020 --> 2:36:32.020]  Are claiming that they're well within their rights
[2:36:32.020 --> 2:36:35.020]  Under the treaties governing this kind of activity
[2:36:35.020 --> 2:36:37.020]  To announce the establishment of this thing
[2:36:37.020 --> 2:36:40.020]  Because it's several, several months more
[2:36:40.020 --> 2:36:42.020]  Before it gets ready to enrich anything
[2:36:42.020 --> 2:36:44.020]  So the hype is there
[2:36:44.020 --> 2:36:46.020]  And the bottom line
[2:36:46.020 --> 2:36:49.020]  People just need to realize
[2:36:49.020 --> 2:36:52.020]  That Iran is nowhere near
[2:36:52.020 --> 2:36:56.020]  Iran is years and years away
[2:36:56.020 --> 2:36:58.020]  From a nuclear weapon
[2:36:58.020 --> 2:36:59.020]  I'll repeat that one more time
[2:36:59.020 --> 2:37:01.020]  Years away from a nuclear weapon
[2:37:01.020 --> 2:37:02.020]  Don't believe the hype
[2:37:02.020 --> 2:37:04.020]  Don't believe what the Israelis are saying
[2:37:04.020 --> 2:37:06.020]  These are technical questions, okay?
[2:37:06.020 --> 2:37:09.020]  Now, when I did the president's daily brief
[2:37:09.020 --> 2:37:11.020]  I didn't write all the briefs, obviously
[2:37:11.020 --> 2:37:14.020]  I know who the good analysts were
[2:37:14.020 --> 2:37:16.020]  The honest technical people
[2:37:16.020 --> 2:37:20.020]  And it was a privilege to put their stuff
[2:37:20.020 --> 2:37:22.020]  In readable form and give it to the president
[2:37:22.020 --> 2:37:24.020]  Well, now I still know those folks
[2:37:24.020 --> 2:37:26.020]  And I'm not getting this from a government head
[2:37:26.020 --> 2:37:29.020]  I'm getting it from people like Greg Thielman
[2:37:29.020 --> 2:37:31.020]  Who ran the State Department
[2:37:31.020 --> 2:37:33.020]  The INR, the research there
[2:37:33.020 --> 2:37:36.020]  And the intelligence outfit at the State Department
[2:37:36.020 --> 2:37:39.020]  And was right, as people were right
[2:37:39.020 --> 2:37:43.020]  Before the Iraq estimate there in 2002
[2:37:43.020 --> 2:37:46.020]  And he now writes for the Arms Control Association
[2:37:46.020 --> 2:37:48.020]  And it's the best stuff out there
[2:37:48.020 --> 2:37:51.020]  Just Google Arms Control Association
[2:37:51.020 --> 2:37:54.020]  You'll see what Greg Thielman is putting together
[2:37:54.020 --> 2:37:56.020]  Boy, boil it down for us then
[2:37:56.020 --> 2:37:58.020]  What does Iran really have?
[2:37:58.020 --> 2:37:59.020]  What are they really doing?
[2:37:59.020 --> 2:38:01.020]  And A, why can Israel have weapons?
[2:38:01.020 --> 2:38:03.020]  Why can Pakistan have weapons?
[2:38:03.020 --> 2:38:04.020]  Why is that okay?
[2:38:04.020 --> 2:38:06.020]  But Iran's nowhere near it
[2:38:06.020 --> 2:38:08.020]  And we're hearing we got to put sanctions on them
[2:38:08.020 --> 2:38:10.020]  We got to attack them
[2:38:10.020 --> 2:38:13.020]  They could kill us any minute
[2:38:13.020 --> 2:38:16.020]  Well, Alex, there will be no news to you
[2:38:16.020 --> 2:38:18.020]  That there is something in this country
[2:38:18.020 --> 2:38:21.020]  That I call the Likud lobby
[2:38:21.020 --> 2:38:24.020]  Likud being the hard right faction
[2:38:24.020 --> 2:38:27.020]  Of the Israeli government, Israeli parties
[2:38:27.020 --> 2:38:30.020]  And they have an ordinate influence in this country
[2:38:30.020 --> 2:38:33.020]  And if you were to ask why it is
[2:38:33.020 --> 2:38:35.020]  That Congress is preparing
[2:38:35.020 --> 2:38:38.020]  Actually preparing as we speak
[2:38:38.020 --> 2:38:42.020]  To pass a law that would actually be an act of war
[2:38:42.020 --> 2:38:45.020]  To contradict the supply of gasoline
[2:38:45.020 --> 2:38:47.020]  And such products to Iran
[2:38:47.020 --> 2:38:48.020]  Why are they doing that?
[2:38:48.020 --> 2:38:52.020]  Well, it's because a lot of their money
[2:38:52.020 --> 2:38:54.020]  And a lot of their votes come from
[2:38:54.020 --> 2:38:56.020]  What I call the Likud lobby
[2:38:56.020 --> 2:38:57.020]  People say
[2:38:57.020 --> 2:38:59.020]  But why does Israel want to attack Iran?
[2:38:59.020 --> 2:39:02.020]  Well, you know, if you look at the Israelis
[2:39:02.020 --> 2:39:05.020]  And their frame of mind
[2:39:05.020 --> 2:39:08.020]  And I think it's a terribly myopic frame of mind
[2:39:08.020 --> 2:39:11.020]  I care about what happens to Israel
[2:39:11.020 --> 2:39:13.020]  And I think it's exactly the wrong policy
[2:39:13.020 --> 2:39:17.020]  They think that if they can sap
[2:39:17.020 --> 2:39:19.020]  The Iranian nuclear facility
[2:39:19.020 --> 2:39:25.020]  As they did to the facility in Iraq in 1983
[2:39:25.020 --> 2:39:27.020]  Then they could set the Iranians back
[2:39:27.020 --> 2:39:29.020]  Go five, ten years perhaps
[2:39:29.020 --> 2:39:31.020]  If they're allowed to do that
[2:39:31.020 --> 2:39:33.020]  Now, that's very myopic
[2:39:33.020 --> 2:39:36.020]  Because the Iranians, unlike the Iraqis in those days
[2:39:36.020 --> 2:39:38.020]  The Iranians can retaliate
[2:39:38.020 --> 2:39:40.020]  They can close the straits
[2:39:40.020 --> 2:39:44.020]  They can decimate our troops in Iraq
[2:39:44.020 --> 2:39:47.020]  And they can hit Israeli cities even now
[2:39:47.020 --> 2:39:50.020]  Not with a nuclear weapon, but with lots of missiles
[2:39:50.020 --> 2:39:53.020]  So it would be bedlam if this happened
[2:39:53.020 --> 2:39:56.020]  And yet the Israelis are trying to get far okay
[2:39:56.020 --> 2:39:57.020]  To let them do it
[2:39:57.020 --> 2:39:59.020]  This is lunacy
[2:39:59.020 --> 2:40:02.020]  And they have this kind of frame of mind
[2:40:02.020 --> 2:40:05.020]  Netanyahu, their prime minister in particular
[2:40:05.020 --> 2:40:07.020]  That this must not be let to happen
[2:40:07.020 --> 2:40:10.020]  And that they're going to delay it as long as they can
[2:40:10.020 --> 2:40:13.020]  If it takes an armed strike, they'll do it
[2:40:13.020 --> 2:40:17.020]  Now, the only thing that is preventing them from doing it
[2:40:17.020 --> 2:40:20.020]  At this point in my estimation is this
[2:40:20.020 --> 2:40:23.020]  Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[2:40:23.020 --> 2:40:26.020]  Who is responsible for our troops and our security
[2:40:26.020 --> 2:40:29.020]  Has gone over to Israel this time last year
[2:40:29.020 --> 2:40:32.020]  And said, look, don't even think about it
[2:40:32.020 --> 2:40:36.020]  You fly your planes over our airspace in Iraq
[2:40:36.020 --> 2:40:38.020]  We're going to shoot them down
[2:40:38.020 --> 2:40:40.020]  So don't even think about this
[2:40:40.020 --> 2:40:44.020]  And don't think you can perpetrate the kind of incident
[2:40:44.020 --> 2:40:48.020]  Like the Liberty incident back in June of 1968
[2:40:48.020 --> 2:40:50.020]  Because we remember that, I'm a naval officer
[2:40:50.020 --> 2:40:52.020]  And that's just not going to happen again
[2:40:52.020 --> 2:40:54.020]  Now that was pretty gutsy
[2:40:54.020 --> 2:40:57.020]  That put the debauch on what the Israelis were planning
[2:40:57.020 --> 2:41:01.020]  The following August, not last August, but August of 1988
[2:41:01.020 --> 2:41:03.020]  Let me go back
[2:41:03.020 --> 2:41:07.020]  We had the Admiral that you just talked about
[2:41:07.020 --> 2:41:10.020]  And then it leaked
[2:41:10.020 --> 2:41:14.020]  It also leaked that
[2:41:14.020 --> 2:41:17.020]  And a New Yorker covered it, MSNBC covered it
[2:41:17.020 --> 2:41:19.020]  Sy Hirsch talked about it
[2:41:19.020 --> 2:41:23.020]  We'd all heard about how these radio calls were coming in
[2:41:23.020 --> 2:41:26.020]  Iranian patrol boats, attack, blow up the destroyers
[2:41:26.020 --> 2:41:29.020]  They're in the Gulf
[2:41:29.020 --> 2:41:32.020]  And then it came out later that Cheney was discussing
[2:41:32.020 --> 2:41:35.020]  Plans to paint up US ships like Iranian patrol boats
[2:41:35.020 --> 2:41:38.020]  And have them attack our ships
[2:41:38.020 --> 2:41:43.020]  Now, this came out a year after
[2:41:43.020 --> 2:41:46.020]  You on this show and other shows said
[2:41:46.020 --> 2:41:49.020]  What I'm hearing from intelligence sources is
[2:41:49.020 --> 2:41:52.020]  They may attack our ships and blame it on Iran
[2:41:52.020 --> 2:41:54.020]  Are you being given specifics?
[2:41:54.020 --> 2:41:56.020]  Because it's one thing to get this from Sy Hirsch
[2:41:56.020 --> 2:41:59.020]  A year after it happened
[2:41:59.020 --> 2:42:02.020]  Now two years ago, it's another thing for you
[2:42:02.020 --> 2:42:04.020]  And I remember the interviews a year before
[2:42:04.020 --> 2:42:06.020]  To say that's what you were concerned about
[2:42:06.020 --> 2:42:09.020]  Well, Alex, I wish I could brag about an inside source
[2:42:09.020 --> 2:42:11.020]  On this particular thing, I cannot
[2:42:11.020 --> 2:42:14.020]  I was using what we in army intelligence
[2:42:14.020 --> 2:42:16.020]  Used to call the swag factor
[2:42:16.020 --> 2:42:18.020]  You know what that is? No
[2:42:18.020 --> 2:42:21.020]  That's a scientific wildest guess
[2:42:21.020 --> 2:42:26.020]  So it's thin slicing or it's dead reckoning
[2:42:26.020 --> 2:42:30.020]  Yeah, try to put yourself in the position of the Israelis
[2:42:30.020 --> 2:42:34.020]  And what success they had with the incident there
[2:42:34.020 --> 2:42:37.020]  Where they killed the 34 of our seamen there
[2:42:37.020 --> 2:42:43.020]  And wounded 171 in June 8, 1967
[2:42:43.020 --> 2:42:48.020]  And they talk about Maksi or Hutzpah
[2:42:48.020 --> 2:42:50.020]  They were quite capable of doing that again
[2:42:50.020 --> 2:42:52.020]  Particularly if they had an ally
[2:42:52.020 --> 2:42:54.020]  And the vice president of the United States
[2:42:54.020 --> 2:42:56.020]  Which clearly they did
[2:42:56.020 --> 2:42:59.020]  And when Sy Hirsch came out with that a year later
[2:42:59.020 --> 2:43:01.020]  You can imagine my reaction
[2:43:01.020 --> 2:43:03.020]  I said, wow, that was a good guess McGovern
[2:43:03.020 --> 2:43:06.020]  But it was just at that point, a guess
[2:43:06.020 --> 2:43:09.020]  Okay, we had Bear on the former CIA
[2:43:09.020 --> 2:43:11.020]  Fellow for folks that don't know
[2:43:11.020 --> 2:43:14.020]  Yeah, and he said two years ago
[2:43:14.020 --> 2:43:17.020]  And I don't trust him as much as I trust you
[2:43:17.020 --> 2:43:19.020]  For obvious reasons
[2:43:19.020 --> 2:43:23.020]  He said, I'm worried about the Saudis
[2:43:23.020 --> 2:43:27.020]  Staging a false flag to blame it on Iran
[2:43:27.020 --> 2:43:30.020]  And then now we see more and more
[2:43:30.020 --> 2:43:33.020]  Similar things coming out along those lines
[2:43:33.020 --> 2:43:35.020]  What's your take on that?
[2:43:35.020 --> 2:43:37.020]  Bob knows the area a lot better than I do
[2:43:37.020 --> 2:43:41.020]  And I have great confidence in his judgment
[2:43:41.020 --> 2:43:46.020]  The Saudis or Sunni, the Iranians or Shia
[2:43:46.020 --> 2:43:49.020]  It may seem like lunacy to us
[2:43:49.020 --> 2:43:51.020]  But that is a great deal in that area
[2:43:51.020 --> 2:43:54.020]  And for the Iranians to become the preponderant power
[2:43:54.020 --> 2:43:57.020]  In that area, well the Saudis don't like that at all
[2:43:57.020 --> 2:44:00.020]  Whether they would resort to this kind of provocation
[2:44:00.020 --> 2:44:02.020]  Or not, I don't know
[2:44:02.020 --> 2:44:05.020]  But Bob would be in a much better position
[2:44:05.020 --> 2:44:07.020]  To speculate on that
[2:44:07.020 --> 2:44:10.020]  Well, I mean, what is it like for you
[2:44:10.020 --> 2:44:12.020]  Knowing the region, studying it
[2:44:12.020 --> 2:44:14.020]  When they get up on the news and say
[2:44:14.020 --> 2:44:16.020]  I'm in Al Qaeda in Afghanistan
[2:44:16.020 --> 2:44:18.020]  When it's the opposite group
[2:44:18.020 --> 2:44:20.020]  See Shunni arch enemies
[2:44:20.020 --> 2:44:23.020]  They fight more than they do with Christians or Jews
[2:44:23.020 --> 2:44:25.020]  Really, if you look at the statistics that I've looked at
[2:44:25.020 --> 2:44:28.020]  I mean, that's like saying the Dallas Cowboys
[2:44:28.020 --> 2:44:31.020]  Are the New York Giants
[2:44:31.020 --> 2:44:33.020]  It's clearly two different groups
[2:44:33.020 --> 2:44:36.020]  And then the famous case two and a half years ago
[2:44:36.020 --> 2:44:39.020]  With the president of Afghanistan
[2:44:39.020 --> 2:44:42.020]  And Bush says, yes, Iran is funding Taliban in Al Qaeda
[2:44:42.020 --> 2:44:44.020]  In Afghanistan
[2:44:44.020 --> 2:44:46.020]  And Mohammed Karzai says, excuse me
[2:44:46.020 --> 2:44:48.020]  Your Excellency, respectfully
[2:44:48.020 --> 2:44:50.020]  But Iran's helping us
[2:44:50.020 --> 2:44:52.020]  Their enemy is Al Qaeda
[2:44:52.020 --> 2:44:54.020]  They're back on the news, as you know
[2:44:54.020 --> 2:44:56.020]  Saying that Iran is Al Qaeda
[2:44:56.020 --> 2:44:58.020]  When the last White House admitted
[2:44:58.020 --> 2:45:00.020]  They were using Al Qaeda-based groups
[2:45:00.020 --> 2:45:02.020]  To stage terror attacks inside Iran
[2:45:02.020 --> 2:45:05.020]  Well, an answer to your question, Alex
[2:45:05.020 --> 2:45:08.020]  I take this blood pressure medicine now
[2:45:08.020 --> 2:45:11.020]  So what is this kind of stuff
[2:45:11.020 --> 2:45:13.020]  Getting aside, you know
[2:45:13.020 --> 2:45:16.020]  When Bush was allowed to mischaracterize
[2:45:16.020 --> 2:45:19.020]  Maybe a nice way of saying things
[2:45:19.020 --> 2:45:21.020]  All these very important developments
[2:45:21.020 --> 2:45:23.020]  And the mainstream press
[2:45:23.020 --> 2:45:25.020]  People like Charlie Gibson
[2:45:25.020 --> 2:45:27.020]  Would just kind of say, oh
[2:45:27.020 --> 2:45:30.020]  I refer specifically to
[2:45:30.020 --> 2:45:32.020]  Bush's famous exit interview
[2:45:32.020 --> 2:45:34.020]  Where Charlie Gibson probably said, well
[2:45:34.020 --> 2:45:36.020]  Mr. President, why did you really think
[2:45:36.020 --> 2:45:38.020]  You had to attack Iraq?
[2:45:38.020 --> 2:45:40.020]  And he said, oh, simple
[2:45:40.020 --> 2:45:43.020]  As Adam Hussein wouldn't let the UN inspectors in
[2:45:43.020 --> 2:45:45.020]  And Charlie Gibson said, oh, okay
[2:45:45.020 --> 2:45:48.020]  He goes back to the next question, you know
[2:45:48.020 --> 2:45:50.020]  But he was letting the inspectors in
[2:45:50.020 --> 2:45:53.020]  They were combing through his palaces
[2:45:53.020 --> 2:45:55.020]  They were interviewing his scientists
[2:45:55.020 --> 2:45:57.020]  One-on-one, it was George Bush
[2:45:57.020 --> 2:45:59.020]  That threw the UN inspectors out
[2:45:59.020 --> 2:46:01.020]  Two days before shock and awe
[2:46:01.020 --> 2:46:03.020]  And Charlie Gibson was taking it away with that
[2:46:03.020 --> 2:46:05.020]  Let's get back to Iran
[2:46:05.020 --> 2:46:07.020]  Here's the, you know, I told you about the estimate
[2:46:07.020 --> 2:46:09.020]  Here it actually appeared in November
[2:46:09.020 --> 2:46:12.020]  Of 07, they started working on it in 06
[2:46:12.020 --> 2:46:15.020]  And so November 07, this big shock
[2:46:15.020 --> 2:46:17.020]  Namely, that the NIE judges
[2:46:17.020 --> 2:46:19.020]  And I used to chair these things
[2:46:19.020 --> 2:46:21.020]  I know what kind of work was into this
[2:46:21.020 --> 2:46:24.020]  High confidence that Tehran had halted
[2:46:24.020 --> 2:46:26.020]  A covert nuclear weapons program
[2:46:26.020 --> 2:46:28.020]  In the fall of 2003
[2:46:28.020 --> 2:46:31.020]  What does the President say the following March?
[2:46:31.020 --> 2:46:34.020]  He says, quote, Iran has declared
[2:46:34.020 --> 2:46:36.020]  That he wants to be a nuclear power
[2:46:36.020 --> 2:46:38.020]  With a weapon to destroy people
[2:46:38.020 --> 2:46:40.020]  Including others in the Middle East
[2:46:40.020 --> 2:46:42.020]  End quote
[2:46:42.020 --> 2:46:44.020]  You know, that's made up
[2:46:44.020 --> 2:46:46.020]  You know, you make that kind of stuff up
[2:46:46.020 --> 2:46:48.020]  But you shouldn't be allowed to get away with it
[2:46:48.020 --> 2:46:50.020]  Iran never declared any such thing
[2:46:50.020 --> 2:46:52.020]  As a matter of fact, the intelligence people
[2:46:52.020 --> 2:46:54.020]  Were telling the President that Iran
[2:46:54.020 --> 2:46:56.020]  Had ceased work on the nuclear weapons
[2:46:56.020 --> 2:46:58.020]  And now they're hyping that again
[2:46:58.020 --> 2:47:00.020]  I was watching CNN this morning
[2:47:00.020 --> 2:47:02.020]  And they cut to some female blonde-haired
[2:47:02.020 --> 2:47:04.020]  Comedian, I missed her name
[2:47:04.020 --> 2:47:06.020]  As if it was news
[2:47:06.020 --> 2:47:08.020]  They go, let's cut to see what she says about Iran
[2:47:08.020 --> 2:47:10.020]  And she's like, Ahmed Dinajade
[2:47:10.020 --> 2:47:12.020]  How dare you say you want to nuke us
[2:47:12.020 --> 2:47:14.020]  And blow everything up
[2:47:14.020 --> 2:47:16.020]  How dare you, we see through you little man
[2:47:16.020 --> 2:47:18.020]  Little devil, and then she laughs
[2:47:18.020 --> 2:47:20.020]  And I'm like, this is news now
[2:47:20.020 --> 2:47:23.020]  When they always distort what he says
[2:47:23.020 --> 2:47:25.020]  And I'm certainly not defending him
[2:47:25.020 --> 2:47:27.020]  Or the mullahs or any of them over there
[2:47:27.020 --> 2:47:29.020]  The point is, is that it's all
[2:47:29.020 --> 2:47:31.020]  Being manufactured again
[2:47:31.020 --> 2:47:33.020]  They're beating the war drums
[2:47:33.020 --> 2:47:35.020]  Here's the big issue
[2:47:35.020 --> 2:47:37.020]  Do you think they're going to hit him
[2:47:37.020 --> 2:47:39.020]  Or will it be sanctions first
[2:47:39.020 --> 2:47:41.020]  Or will they false flag
[2:47:41.020 --> 2:47:43.020]  Or where is this going?
[2:47:43.020 --> 2:47:45.020]  Well, it depends on how staunchly
[2:47:45.020 --> 2:47:47.020]  The only reputable
[2:47:47.020 --> 2:47:49.020]  Institution in our government
[2:47:49.020 --> 2:47:51.020]  Stands up to this
[2:47:51.020 --> 2:47:53.020]  I have a lot of admiration for
[2:47:53.020 --> 2:47:55.020]  Admiral Mullen
[2:47:55.020 --> 2:47:57.020]  I think that, you know, he's inclined
[2:47:57.020 --> 2:47:59.020]  And, you know, put a knee-jerk
[2:47:59.020 --> 2:48:01.020]  To obey orders
[2:48:01.020 --> 2:48:03.020]  But he and his predecessor
[2:48:03.020 --> 2:48:05.020]  Fallen, you remember Fallen quit
[2:48:05.020 --> 2:48:07.020]  When he was sent com commander
[2:48:07.020 --> 2:48:09.020]  Because he had said, we're not going to do
[2:48:09.020 --> 2:48:11.020]  Iran on my watch
[2:48:11.020 --> 2:48:13.020]  And it took several months
[2:48:13.020 --> 2:48:15.020]  Because he knows what will happen
[2:48:15.020 --> 2:48:17.020]  We should talk about what will happen
[2:48:17.020 --> 2:48:19.020]  The three scenarios that Iran gets hit
[2:48:19.020 --> 2:48:21.020]  That's exactly right
[2:48:21.020 --> 2:48:23.020]  One of them, you know, says
[2:48:23.020 --> 2:48:25.020]  Iran has the capability
[2:48:25.020 --> 2:48:27.020]  Of closing the streets of Hormuz
[2:48:27.020 --> 2:48:29.020]  Now, okay, that's where
[2:48:29.020 --> 2:48:31.020]  Two thirds of the oil that comes out
[2:48:31.020 --> 2:48:33.020]  Of the oil rich Middle East
[2:48:33.020 --> 2:48:35.020]  Has to come through, okay, now
[2:48:35.020 --> 2:48:37.020]  What's Mullen say to that question
[2:48:37.020 --> 2:48:39.020]  He says, yes, Iranians
[2:48:39.020 --> 2:48:41.020]  Have the capability
[2:48:41.020 --> 2:48:43.020]  Of closing the streets
[2:48:43.020 --> 2:48:45.020]  But we can reopen them
[2:48:45.020 --> 2:48:47.020]  How are we going to reopen them?
[2:48:47.020 --> 2:48:49.020]  Send the Marine division
[2:48:49.020 --> 2:48:51.020]  Into the cliffs overlooking
[2:48:51.020 --> 2:48:53.020]  The streets of Hormuz
[2:48:53.020 --> 2:48:55.020]  When they've got 12,000 sunburn
[2:48:55.020 --> 2:48:57.020]  Missiles aiming down
[2:48:57.020 --> 2:48:59.020]  We're going to get the Marine division
[2:48:59.020 --> 2:49:01.020]  They're all already
[2:49:01.020 --> 2:49:03.020]  Exhausted in
[2:49:03.020 --> 2:49:05.020]  Afghanistan and some of them
[2:49:05.020 --> 2:49:07.020]  Left in Iraq, so
[2:49:07.020 --> 2:49:09.020]  This all has a degree of unreality
[2:49:09.020 --> 2:49:11.020]  And when I see Senator
[2:49:11.020 --> 2:49:13.020]  Kit Bond of Missouri and John
[2:49:13.020 --> 2:49:15.020]  Kyle talking about
[2:49:15.020 --> 2:49:17.020]  We need regime change
[2:49:17.020 --> 2:49:19.020]  We need regime change in Iran
[2:49:19.020 --> 2:49:21.020]  Because there's such a threat to Israel
[2:49:21.020 --> 2:49:23.020]  Well, you know, that just reminds me
[2:49:23.020 --> 2:49:25.020]  Of the old saw when they offered
[2:49:25.020 --> 2:49:27.020]  To make Israel
[2:49:27.020 --> 2:49:29.020]  The 51st state of the United States
[2:49:29.020 --> 2:49:31.020]  Israel refused
[2:49:31.020 --> 2:49:33.020]  You know why, Alex
[2:49:33.020 --> 2:49:35.020]  Because then they'd only have
[2:49:35.020 --> 2:49:37.020]  Two senators
[2:49:37.020 --> 2:49:39.020]  Oh, man
[2:49:39.020 --> 2:49:41.020]  You know
[2:49:41.020 --> 2:49:43.020]  This is just insane
[2:49:43.020 --> 2:49:45.020]  So what's the intel you're getting
[2:49:45.020 --> 2:49:47.020]  Are they planning to hit Iran?
[2:49:47.020 --> 2:49:49.020]  Or are they just going to have sanctions?
[2:49:49.020 --> 2:49:51.020]  Where is this going?
[2:49:51.020 --> 2:49:53.020]  I think Netanyahu is shaping at the bit
[2:49:53.020 --> 2:49:55.020]  And I think
[2:49:55.020 --> 2:49:57.020]  Obama is under great pressure
[2:49:57.020 --> 2:49:59.020]  From the Likud lobby
[2:49:59.020 --> 2:50:01.020]  And from those still in the White House
[2:50:01.020 --> 2:50:03.020]  Who have great difficulty
[2:50:03.020 --> 2:50:05.020]  Distinguishing between what they perceive
[2:50:05.020 --> 2:50:07.020]  To be the strategic interests
[2:50:07.020 --> 2:50:09.020]  Of Israel on the one hand
[2:50:09.020 --> 2:50:11.020]  And those of the United States
[2:50:11.020 --> 2:50:13.020]  On the other
[2:50:13.020 --> 2:50:15.020]  I hope
[2:50:15.020 --> 2:50:17.020]  And that's what it is, I hope
[2:50:17.020 --> 2:50:19.020]  It's just a little bit more than
[2:50:19.020 --> 2:50:21.020]  A little less than an expectation
[2:50:21.020 --> 2:50:23.020]  That they'll stand up to this
[2:50:23.020 --> 2:50:25.020]  This would be a ruinous war
[2:50:25.020 --> 2:50:27.020]  This would be worse than
[2:50:27.020 --> 2:50:29.020]  What he contemplates doing in Afghanistan
[2:50:29.020 --> 2:50:31.020]  This would be bedlam
[2:50:31.020 --> 2:50:33.020]  And I think that as long as he listens
[2:50:33.020 --> 2:50:35.020]  To people like Marlon
[2:50:35.020 --> 2:50:37.020]  That he'll be restrained
[2:50:37.020 --> 2:50:39.020]  Final segment with Ray McGovern straight ahead
[2:50:39.020 --> 2:50:41.020]  I want to get his take on the Russia situation
[2:50:41.020 --> 2:50:43.020]  Where he thinks Afghanistan's going
[2:50:43.020 --> 2:50:45.020]  I just wish we could stop
[2:50:45.020 --> 2:50:47.020]  Having all these wars
[2:50:47.020 --> 2:50:49.020]  I mean, our government has overthrown Iran
[2:50:49.020 --> 2:50:51.020]  And finally, they're constantly
[2:50:51.020 --> 2:50:53.020]  Meddling inside their nation
[2:50:53.020 --> 2:50:55.020]  We've really done this country wrong, folks
[2:50:55.020 --> 2:50:57.020]  And now they're saying they're going to nuke us
[2:50:57.020 --> 2:50:59.020]  I mean, it's just pure bull
[2:51:05.020 --> 2:51:07.020]  It's here after a year in production
[2:51:07.020 --> 2:51:09.020]  And traveling the distant lands
[2:51:09.020 --> 2:51:11.020]  My new film Terror Storm is complete
[2:51:11.020 --> 2:51:13.020]  Shocking declassified government documents
[2:51:13.020 --> 2:51:15.020]  Prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[2:51:15.020 --> 2:51:17.020]  Against their own populations
[2:51:17.020 --> 2:51:19.020]  To enslave them
[2:51:19.020 --> 2:51:21.020]  Terror Storm proves that not only
[2:51:21.020 --> 2:51:23.020]  Was 9-11 an inside job
[2:51:23.020 --> 2:51:25.020]  But the attacks of 7-7 in London
[2:51:25.020 --> 2:51:27.020]  Were carried out by British intelligence
[2:51:27.020 --> 2:51:29.020]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies
[2:51:29.020 --> 2:51:31.020]  That took us to war in Iran
[2:51:31.020 --> 2:51:33.020]  A White House program to disseminate fake news
[2:51:33.020 --> 2:51:35.020]  NSA spying, secret police torture
[2:51:35.020 --> 2:51:37.020]  The latest 9-11 information
[2:51:37.020 --> 2:51:39.020]  And much, much more
[2:51:39.020 --> 2:51:41.020]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide
[2:51:41.020 --> 2:51:43.020]  Of the history of government-sponsored terrorism
[2:51:43.020 --> 2:51:45.020]  It's an anthology of government crimes
[2:51:45.020 --> 2:51:47.020]  That everyone who wants to be truly informed

[2:52:01.020 --> 2:52:03.020]  This is an emergency alert
[2:52:03.020 --> 2:52:05.020]  More than half the world's doctors
[2:52:05.020 --> 2:52:07.020]  And nurses are refusing
[2:52:07.020 --> 2:52:09.020]  Risky vaccinations this fall
[2:52:09.020 --> 2:52:11.020]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz
[2:52:11.020 --> 2:52:13.020]  A Harvard-trained public health expert
[2:52:13.020 --> 2:52:15.020]  Urging you to avoid risky vaccinations
[2:52:15.020 --> 2:52:17.020]  Especially this flu season
[2:52:17.020 --> 2:52:19.020]  Rely on oxysilver instead
[2:52:21.020 --> 2:52:23.020]  Oxysilver's broad-spectrum action
[2:52:23.020 --> 2:52:25.020]  Makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary

[2:52:27.020 --> 2:52:29.020]  Silver hydrosol
[2:52:29.020 --> 2:52:31.020]  Far safer than colloidal silvers

[2:53:03.020 --> 2:53:05.020]  What does humidity mean to you?
[2:53:05.020 --> 2:53:07.020]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days
[2:53:07.020 --> 2:53:09.020]  But many people are beginning to realize
[2:53:09.020 --> 2:53:11.020]  That humidity can be a valuable source
[2:53:11.020 --> 2:53:13.020]  Of pure drinking water
[2:53:13.020 --> 2:53:15.020]  That's why I'd like you to visit

[2:54:23.020 --> 2:54:25.020]  Ray McGovern is our guest, final segment
[2:54:25.020 --> 2:54:27.020]  Ray, what about the rest of the world?
[2:54:27.020 --> 2:54:29.020]  Geopolitically, what's going on?
[2:54:29.020 --> 2:54:31.020]  Well, what's going on is
[2:54:31.020 --> 2:54:33.020]  The rest of the world is looking at us
[2:54:33.020 --> 2:54:35.020]  And kind of shaking its head
[2:54:35.020 --> 2:54:37.020]  The Russians and the Chinese
[2:54:37.020 --> 2:54:39.020]  And the Indians are the big players, of course
[2:54:39.020 --> 2:54:41.020]  As they watch what we're trying to do
[2:54:41.020 --> 2:54:43.020]  In Afghanistan
[2:54:43.020 --> 2:54:45.020]  You know, there's sort of
[2:54:45.020 --> 2:54:47.020]  Trugging their shoulders
[2:54:47.020 --> 2:54:49.020]  And saying, well, be our guest
[2:54:49.020 --> 2:54:51.020]  We all tried that in Afghanistan
[2:54:51.020 --> 2:54:53.020]  We all failed
[2:54:53.020 --> 2:54:55.020]  Going back to
[2:54:55.020 --> 2:54:57.020]  Going back to, I was at the end of the great
[2:54:57.020 --> 2:54:59.020]  Not to mention Chinggis Khan
[2:54:59.020 --> 2:55:01.020]  And the Persians and the Indians
[2:55:01.020 --> 2:55:03.020]  And the British and the Russians
[2:55:03.020 --> 2:55:05.020]  Go ahead
[2:55:05.020 --> 2:55:07.020]  Waste your military
[2:55:07.020 --> 2:55:09.020]  And with respect to
[2:55:09.020 --> 2:55:11.020]  With Iran
[2:55:11.020 --> 2:55:13.020]  The Russians used to care
[2:55:13.020 --> 2:55:15.020]  A great deal about what happened
[2:55:15.020 --> 2:55:17.020]  On their soft southern underbelly
[2:55:17.020 --> 2:55:19.020]  But they seemed
[2:55:19.020 --> 2:55:21.020]  Almost cavalier with respect
[2:55:21.020 --> 2:55:23.020]  To Iranian plans
[2:55:23.020 --> 2:55:25.020]  And I think part of that has to do with
[2:55:25.020 --> 2:55:27.020]  The fact that they
[2:55:27.020 --> 2:55:29.020]  They don't have Israel as their
[2:55:29.020 --> 2:55:31.020]  Quote, ally
[2:55:31.020 --> 2:55:33.020]  And what are these quotes?
[2:55:33.020 --> 2:55:35.020]  Well, because 99% of
[2:55:35.020 --> 2:55:37.020]  American people believe
[2:55:37.020 --> 2:55:39.020]  That Israel is an ally of the United States
[2:55:39.020 --> 2:55:41.020]  That's wrong
[2:55:41.020 --> 2:55:43.020]  An alliance requires a treaty
[2:55:43.020 --> 2:55:45.020]  There is no mutual defense treaty
[2:55:45.020 --> 2:55:47.020]  Between the United States and Israel
[2:55:47.020 --> 2:55:49.020]  And the reason there is none
[2:55:49.020 --> 2:55:51.020]  Is because treaties require
[2:55:51.020 --> 2:55:53.020]  Internationally recognized boundaries
[2:55:53.020 --> 2:55:55.020]  And Israel is in possession
[2:55:55.020 --> 2:55:57.020]  For over 60 years now
[2:55:57.020 --> 2:55:59.020]  No, 60 years from
[2:55:59.020 --> 2:56:01.020]  67 until now
[2:56:01.020 --> 2:56:03.020]  Whatever the math is
[2:56:03.020 --> 2:56:05.020]  Of the occupied territories
[2:56:05.020 --> 2:56:07.020]  West Bank, East Jerusalem
[2:56:07.020 --> 2:56:09.020]  And the Gaza Strip
[2:56:09.020 --> 2:56:11.020]  And Israel, the last thing it wants
[2:56:11.020 --> 2:56:13.020]  Is to have any international body
[2:56:13.020 --> 2:56:15.020]  Draw the borders
[2:56:15.020 --> 2:56:17.020]  Back to where they used to be
[2:56:17.020 --> 2:56:19.020]  So there is no alliance
[2:56:19.020 --> 2:56:21.020]  We proceed
[2:56:21.020 --> 2:56:23.020]  And the media characterizes
[2:56:23.020 --> 2:56:25.020]  Our relationship with Israel as an alliance
[2:56:25.020 --> 2:56:27.020]  Our policy makers treat it that way
[2:56:27.020 --> 2:56:29.020]  But Russia sits back
[2:56:29.020 --> 2:56:31.020]  And laughs and says
[2:56:31.020 --> 2:56:33.020]  Well, if they do something really idiotic
[2:56:33.020 --> 2:56:35.020]  If they close the streets of Hormuz
[2:56:35.020 --> 2:56:37.020]  Guess who benefits
[2:56:37.020 --> 2:56:39.020]  Who benefits?
[2:56:39.020 --> 2:56:40.020]  Russia
[2:56:40.020 --> 2:56:42.020]  Russia has got all the oil, you know
[2:56:42.020 --> 2:56:44.020]  Man, at the price of oil, you know
[2:56:44.020 --> 2:56:46.020]  We'll be able to have a villa
[2:56:46.020 --> 2:56:48.020]  We'll have a dacha for each little
[2:56:48.020 --> 2:56:50.020]  Worker in the Russia
[2:56:50.020 --> 2:56:52.020]  Is that why Russia met with Netanyahu
[2:56:52.020 --> 2:56:54.020]  Secretly a month ago and has now said
[2:56:54.020 --> 2:56:56.020]  They support sanctions against Iran?
[2:56:56.020 --> 2:56:58.020]  Well, you know, Russia plays a very clever game
[2:56:58.020 --> 2:57:00.020]  You know, they express
[2:57:00.020 --> 2:57:02.020]  Concern about this
[2:57:02.020 --> 2:57:04.020]  And then they go ahead
[2:57:04.020 --> 2:57:06.020]  Now, with Netanyahu
[2:57:06.020 --> 2:57:08.020]  They are restraining influence
[2:57:08.020 --> 2:57:10.020]  Although they don't care as much as we do
[2:57:10.020 --> 2:57:12.020]  So
[2:57:12.020 --> 2:57:14.020]  When Netanyahu goes up there
[2:57:14.020 --> 2:57:16.020]  What you expect him to get
[2:57:16.020 --> 2:57:18.020]  Approval for a strike on Iran
[2:57:18.020 --> 2:57:20.020]  But some sort of reassurance that
[2:57:20.020 --> 2:57:22.020]  For example, the Russians
[2:57:22.020 --> 2:57:24.020]  Won't sell sophisticated
[2:57:24.020 --> 2:57:26.020]  Missiles to defend the
[2:57:26.020 --> 2:57:28.020]  Iranian
[2:57:28.020 --> 2:57:30.020]  Sites there at the enrichment sites
[2:57:30.020 --> 2:57:32.020]  So
[2:57:32.020 --> 2:57:34.020]  You know, last year
[2:57:34.020 --> 2:57:36.020]  Ehud Olmer
[2:57:36.020 --> 2:57:38.020]  Went to Moscow
[2:57:38.020 --> 2:57:40.020]  And he was summoned there
[2:57:40.020 --> 2:57:42.020]  And the Russians warned him
[2:57:42.020 --> 2:57:44.020]  In similarly definitive terms
[2:57:44.020 --> 2:57:46.020]  Like Admiral Mullen
[2:57:46.020 --> 2:57:48.020]  Don't even think of attacking Iran
[2:57:48.020 --> 2:57:50.020]  So the Russians have no real incentive
[2:57:50.020 --> 2:57:52.020]  For that kind of attack
[2:57:52.020 --> 2:57:54.020]  But if it happens
[2:57:54.020 --> 2:57:56.020]  You know, they're going to be the big
[2:57:56.020 --> 2:57:58.020]  Beneficiary by doubling
[2:57:58.020 --> 2:58:00.020]  The price of their work
[2:58:00.020 --> 2:58:02.020]  We're almost out of time in the last minute
[2:58:02.020 --> 2:58:04.020]  Do you think it's sanctions or an attack?
[2:58:04.020 --> 2:58:06.020]  I mean, if you had to make a dead reckoning again
[2:58:06.020 --> 2:58:08.020]  Do you think they're going to hit Iran
[2:58:08.020 --> 2:58:10.020]  The next year or two?
[2:58:10.020 --> 2:58:12.020]  Gosh, I don't know Alex
[2:58:12.020 --> 2:58:14.020]  It will depend on how this thing plays out
[2:58:14.020 --> 2:58:16.020]  There will be sanctions first
[2:58:16.020 --> 2:58:18.020]  But
[2:58:18.020 --> 2:58:20.020]  There's great pressure for an attack
[2:58:20.020 --> 2:58:22.020]  And I would not rule out
[2:58:22.020 --> 2:58:24.020]  The likelihood that Israel would be given
[2:58:24.020 --> 2:58:26.020]  A nod by somebody in the White House
[2:58:26.020 --> 2:58:28.020]  And go ahead and do it and force our hand
[2:58:28.020 --> 2:58:30.020]  And then Iran will go
[2:58:30.020 --> 2:58:32.020]  Absolutely wild
[2:58:32.020 --> 2:58:34.020]  Oh, yeah, it will be bedlam
[2:58:34.020 --> 2:58:36.020]  And we'll suffer great attrition for our own troops
[2:58:36.020 --> 2:58:38.020]  In the area
[2:58:38.020 --> 2:58:40.020]  Ray McGovern, thank you for your time
[2:58:40.020 --> 2:58:42.020]  Thank you
[2:58:42.020 --> 2:58:44.020]  Thank you for listening to GCN
[2:58:44.020 --> 2:58:46.020]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com
[2:58:46.020 --> 2:58:48.020]  Today
[2:58:48.020 --> 2:58:50.020]  Have you ever wanted to
[2:58:50.020 --> 2:58:52.020]  Generate your own supply of electrical power?
[2:58:52.020 --> 2:58:54.020]  If so, this is going to be
[2:58:54.020 --> 2:58:56.020]  The most important message you will ever hear
[2:58:56.020 --> 2:58:58.020]  Solar power generators are now available
[2:58:58.020 --> 2:59:00.020]  From Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois
[2:59:00.020 --> 2:59:02.020]  These emergency backup systems
[2:59:02.020 --> 2:59:04.020]  Provide life saving electrical power
[2:59:04.020 --> 2:59:06.020]  When you need it most
[2:59:06.020 --> 2:59:08.020]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator
[2:59:08.020 --> 2:59:10.020]  Runs quietly, emits no fumes
[2:59:10.020 --> 2:59:12.020]  And produces electricity for free
[2:59:12.020 --> 2:59:14.020]  It's like having an electric power plant
[2:59:14.020 --> 2:59:16.020]  Running quietly in your own home
[2:59:16.020 --> 2:59:18.020]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers
[2:59:18.020 --> 2:59:20.020]  And even keep food from spoiling
[2:59:20.020 --> 2:59:22.020]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms
[2:59:22.020 --> 2:59:24.020]  Brownouts or blackouts
[2:59:24.020 --> 2:59:26.020]  You'll never have to suffer through
[2:59:26.020 --> 2:59:28.020]  Painful power outages again
[2:59:28.020 --> 2:59:30.020]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready
[2:59:30.020 --> 2:59:32.020]  With a solar power generator
[2:59:32.020 --> 2:59:34.020]  From Solutions from Science
[2:59:34.020 --> 2:59:36.020]  Go to mysolarbackup.com
[2:59:36.020 --> 2:59:38.020]  And get off the grid today
[2:59:38.020 --> 2:59:40.020]  That's mysolarbackup.com
[2:59:40.020 --> 2:59:44.020]  Or call 877-327-0365
[2:59:44.020 --> 2:59:48.020]  877-327-0365
[2:59:48.020 --> 3:00:10.020]  Don't wait, call today!
[3:00:18.020 --> 3:00:31.020]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen
[3:00:31.020 --> 3:00:33.020]  All letting into the fourth and final hour
[3:00:33.020 --> 3:00:35.020]  Of this worldwide broadcast
[3:00:35.020 --> 3:00:39.020]  Wednesday 30th of September 2009
[3:00:39.020 --> 3:00:42.020]  Wanted to give you Ray McGovern's perspective
[3:00:42.020 --> 3:00:44.020]  On the Iran situation
[3:00:44.020 --> 3:00:47.020]  We just got that from him
[3:00:47.020 --> 3:00:49.020]  Going to be getting into
[3:00:49.020 --> 3:00:51.020]  How we are on the enemy's list
[3:00:51.020 --> 3:00:54.020]  Of new developments from Hardin, Montana
[3:00:54.020 --> 3:00:56.020]  As well
[3:00:56.020 --> 3:00:58.020]  With a fellow that's been doing
[3:00:58.020 --> 3:01:00.020]  Some in-depth research there
[3:01:00.020 --> 3:01:03.020]  That is coming up in the next segment
[3:01:03.020 --> 3:01:08.020]  We've got several Hardin clips
[3:01:08.020 --> 3:01:09.020]  Which one do we have first?
[3:01:09.020 --> 3:01:11.020]  I want to play a few of these
[3:01:11.020 --> 3:01:13.020]  We're going to play a few of these news reports
[3:01:13.020 --> 3:01:15.020]  Of what's happening in Hardin
[3:01:15.020 --> 3:01:17.020]  And then we'll be right back
[3:01:17.020 --> 3:01:19.020]  Stay with us after this quick break
[3:01:19.020 --> 3:01:20.020]  Some of the history of it
[3:01:20.020 --> 3:01:22.020]  The would-be FEMA camp with weird
[3:01:22.020 --> 3:01:24.020]  Paramilitary forces patrolling around at it
[3:01:24.020 --> 3:01:28.020]  And then we will continue
[3:01:28.020 --> 3:01:30.020]  Here we go
[3:01:30.020 --> 3:01:35.020]  This could be Gitmo West
[3:01:35.020 --> 3:01:37.020]  Right now it's a prison with no prisoners
[3:01:37.020 --> 3:01:39.020]  In tiny Hardin, Montana
[3:01:39.020 --> 3:01:41.020]  City officials want to fill it
[3:01:41.020 --> 3:01:43.020]  With detainees from Guantanamo Bay
[3:01:43.020 --> 3:01:45.020]  Terrorists, like self-proclaimed
[3:01:45.020 --> 3:01:47.020]  9-11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed
[3:01:47.020 --> 3:01:49.020]  It would bring jobs
[3:01:49.020 --> 3:01:51.020]  Believe it or not, it would even bring
[3:01:51.020 --> 3:01:53.020]  Hope and opportunity
[3:01:53.020 --> 3:01:55.020]  This is the poorest county in Montana
[3:01:55.020 --> 3:01:57.020]  And the $27 million prison
[3:01:57.020 --> 3:01:59.020]  Has turned into a white elephant
[3:01:59.020 --> 3:02:01.020]  But not everyone wants detainees here
[3:02:01.020 --> 3:02:03.020]  I would move out of Hardin
[3:02:03.020 --> 3:02:05.020]  My son is in the military
[3:02:05.020 --> 3:02:07.020]  He came back from Afghanistan
[3:02:07.020 --> 3:02:09.020]  He says that people have no respect
[3:02:09.020 --> 3:02:12.020]  For any human life, even their own
[3:02:12.020 --> 3:02:14.020]  There are some of the most dangerous people
[3:02:14.020 --> 3:02:16.020]  In the world, and some in the community
[3:02:16.020 --> 3:02:18.020]  Worry that if they were here
[3:02:18.020 --> 3:02:20.020]  In this medium-security prison
[3:02:20.020 --> 3:02:22.020]  They would attract other radicals to the area
[3:02:22.020 --> 3:02:24.020]  Or even worse, escape
[3:02:24.020 --> 3:02:26.020]  The person that wants to make it an issue
[3:02:26.020 --> 3:02:28.020]  Would be happy to lock them up
[3:02:28.020 --> 3:02:30.020]  And see how long it takes them to come out
[3:02:30.020 --> 3:02:32.020]  And then if they can, I'll buy a coffee
[3:02:32.020 --> 3:02:34.020]  At the coffee shop, not a problem
[3:02:34.020 --> 3:02:36.020]  There are plenty of cameras and wiring for more
[3:02:36.020 --> 3:02:38.020]  And row upon row of razor wire
[3:02:38.020 --> 3:02:40.020]  They're even ready for trouble here
[3:02:40.020 --> 3:02:42.020]  They've got gas masks and riot helmets
[3:02:42.020 --> 3:02:44.020]  Shields, batons
[3:02:44.020 --> 3:02:46.020]  They even have guns
[3:02:46.020 --> 3:02:48.020]  There's also open land
[3:02:48.020 --> 3:02:50.020]  Around the prison that would make a getaway
[3:02:50.020 --> 3:02:52.020]  Difficult
[3:02:52.020 --> 3:02:54.020]  Because there are no prisoners, Glenn and Ray Perkins
[3:02:54.020 --> 3:02:56.020]  Got laid off after moving to Hardin
[3:02:56.020 --> 3:02:58.020]  To take guard jobs
[3:02:58.020 --> 3:03:00.020]  They've worked at maximum security prisons
[3:03:00.020 --> 3:03:02.020]  In Texas
[3:03:02.020 --> 3:03:04.020]  Everything in this one is state-of-the-art
[3:03:04.020 --> 3:03:06.020]  It's the most
[3:03:06.020 --> 3:03:08.020]  Securious place I've ever worked in
[3:03:08.020 --> 3:03:10.020]  Even more secure than those maximum security facilities
[3:03:10.020 --> 3:03:12.020]  Yeah, absolutely
[3:03:12.020 --> 3:03:14.020]  But they oppose moving detainees here
[3:03:14.020 --> 3:03:16.020]  Even though it might mean getting their jobs back
[3:03:16.020 --> 3:03:18.020]  Bottom line, I just want the facility to open
[3:03:18.020 --> 3:03:20.020]  But no, I don't really want to get my backyard
[3:03:20.020 --> 3:03:22.020]  Montana's senators agree
[3:03:22.020 --> 3:03:24.020]  I don't think they know what they're asking for
[3:03:24.020 --> 3:03:26.020]  When they're asking for these
[3:03:26.020 --> 3:03:28.020]  To take these prisoners on
[3:03:28.020 --> 3:03:30.020]  But President Obama wants to close Guantanamo
[3:03:30.020 --> 3:03:32.020]  In January
[3:03:32.020 --> 3:03:34.020]  And if that happens, the detainees will have to go
[3:03:34.020 --> 3:03:36.020]  Somewhere
[3:03:36.020 --> 3:03:38.020]  Coming into a community
[3:03:38.020 --> 3:03:40.020]  That really wants them
[3:03:40.020 --> 3:03:42.020]  Is going to be a lot easier
[3:03:42.020 --> 3:03:44.020]  Than going into one that doesn't
[3:03:44.020 --> 3:03:46.020]  And this may be the only city
[3:03:46.020 --> 3:03:48.020]  In the country that's ready, willing
[3:03:48.020 --> 3:03:50.020]  And able to take them
[3:03:50.020 --> 3:03:52.020]  Gene Mazerve, CNN
[3:03:52.020 --> 3:04:08.020]  Hardin, Montana
[3:04:22.020 --> 3:04:26.020]  But he rose again
[3:04:26.020 --> 3:04:30.020]  Wise men follow him
[3:04:30.020 --> 3:04:32.020]  But he rose again
[3:04:32.020 --> 3:04:36.020]  Wise men follow him
[3:04:36.020 --> 3:04:40.020]  Thank God for the renegades
[3:04:40.020 --> 3:04:42.020]  And the lives they need
[3:04:42.020 --> 3:04:46.020]  For the head of Guantanamo
[3:04:46.020 --> 3:04:48.020]  They're tight
[3:04:48.020 --> 3:04:50.020]  Without the renegades
[3:04:50.020 --> 3:04:54.020]  God knows where we'd be
[3:04:54.020 --> 3:04:56.020]  When it comes to heroes
[3:04:56.020 --> 3:05:22.020]  And renegade your mind
[3:05:22.020 --> 3:05:26.020]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:05:26.020 --> 3:05:28.020]  Will it make your children sick?
[3:05:28.020 --> 3:05:30.020]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself
[3:05:30.020 --> 3:05:32.020]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:05:32.020 --> 3:05:34.020]  You wipe out all these problems
[3:05:34.020 --> 3:05:36.020]  If you have a good food supply
[3:05:36.020 --> 3:05:38.020]  Food is your ammunition to fight
[3:05:38.020 --> 3:05:40.020]  For your freedom and your life
[3:05:40.020 --> 3:05:42.020]  How much will you need? We don't know
[3:05:42.020 --> 3:05:44.020]  How much do you want? All you can get
[3:05:44.020 --> 3:05:46.020]  I'm Alex Jones
[3:05:46.020 --> 3:05:48.020]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day

[3:06:01.020 --> 3:06:03.020]  The illusion created by the power elite
[3:06:03.020 --> 3:06:06.020]  Is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat
[3:06:06.020 --> 3:06:08.020]  Will you continue to be their profit center
[3:06:08.020 --> 3:06:11.020]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick
[3:06:11.020 --> 3:06:13.020]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs
[3:06:13.020 --> 3:06:15.020]  You don't have to cooperate
[3:06:15.020 --> 3:06:16.020]  There is a solution

[3:06:38.020 --> 3:06:41.020]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee

[3:07:34.020 --> 3:07:37.020]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals

[3:07:39.020 --> 3:07:43.020]  When they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid
[3:07:43.020 --> 3:07:45.020]  Don't pick your nose, don't shake hands
[3:07:45.020 --> 3:07:49.020]  And don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs
[3:07:49.020 --> 3:07:52.020]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing
[3:07:52.020 --> 3:07:54.020]  To Alex Jones listeners
[3:07:54.020 --> 3:07:57.020]  Go to NoGerms.info
[3:07:57.020 --> 3:07:59.020]  That's NoGerms.info
[3:07:59.020 --> 3:08:26.020]  And stay well, best MZ
[3:08:26.020 --> 3:08:29.020]  Michael Hollingsworth has done a really good journalistic job
[3:08:29.020 --> 3:08:32.020]  We have a story posted up at infowars.com
[3:08:32.020 --> 3:08:35.020]  Harden, Montana under siege is the headline
[3:08:35.020 --> 3:08:40.020]  Now, what we know is this American police force
[3:08:40.020 --> 3:08:42.020]  Is a foreign mercenary company
[3:08:42.020 --> 3:08:47.020]  I've got local newscast with legislators at the state house
[3:08:47.020 --> 3:08:49.020]  Saying, yeah, they won't say who they are
[3:08:49.020 --> 3:08:51.020]  Where the money came from
[3:08:51.020 --> 3:08:54.020]  They've done weird court battles to overturn Montana law
[3:08:54.020 --> 3:08:56.020]  To get the $27 million facility
[3:08:56.020 --> 3:08:58.020]  They announced they're going to bring in foreign troops
[3:08:58.020 --> 3:08:59.020]  To train there
[3:08:59.020 --> 3:09:01.020]  I mean, we've got scores
[3:09:01.020 --> 3:09:04.020]  I know it's more than 15 different newscasts we posted
[3:09:04.020 --> 3:09:07.020]  CNN, Billings News, local news
[3:09:07.020 --> 3:09:11.020]  Saying everything that's basically in Michael Hollingsworth's article
[3:09:11.020 --> 3:09:14.020]  I did read in the Billings Gazette
[3:09:14.020 --> 3:09:17.020]  And other newspapers in California
[3:09:17.020 --> 3:09:18.020]  Not just Montana
[3:09:18.020 --> 3:09:20.020]  That this Billings Gazette writer
[3:09:20.020 --> 3:09:23.020]  Has gone to work for them all of a sudden
[3:09:23.020 --> 3:09:26.020]  Lots of bizarre stuff going on there
[3:09:26.020 --> 3:09:29.020]  You've got this weird foreigner who runs it all
[3:09:29.020 --> 3:09:31.020]  Going around
[3:09:31.020 --> 3:09:34.020]  They've got foreign commanders who are on the news
[3:09:34.020 --> 3:09:36.020]  And they say it's all secret, we're not telling you
[3:09:36.020 --> 3:09:37.020]  But then we have earlier news
[3:09:37.020 --> 3:09:41.020]  Till the people said no from April
[3:09:41.020 --> 3:09:43.020]  Where they said it was going to be Guantanamo West
[3:09:43.020 --> 3:09:45.020]  We have CNN and local news
[3:09:45.020 --> 3:09:47.020]  But as soon as the public said first
[3:09:47.020 --> 3:09:50.020]  They made the public pay for this with a bomb proposal
[3:09:50.020 --> 3:09:53.020]  And then it sat there empty for the last year and a half
[3:09:53.020 --> 3:09:55.020]  It's a giant facility
[3:09:55.020 --> 3:09:59.020]  This American police force put their decals on SUVs
[3:09:59.020 --> 3:10:01.020]  Saying they were the local hardened police force
[3:10:01.020 --> 3:10:03.020]  This is all confirmed
[3:10:03.020 --> 3:10:07.020]  But Michael Hollingsworth has been interviewing the locals
[3:10:07.020 --> 3:10:10.020]  Talking to them, he knows who all of them are
[3:10:10.020 --> 3:10:13.020]  We're going to be reporting with him in the next few days here on air
[3:10:13.020 --> 3:10:17.020]  I will let you know that by Friday at least
[3:10:17.020 --> 3:10:19.020]  We're going to have reporters on the ground there
[3:10:19.020 --> 3:10:21.020]  Imagine who may be there
[3:10:21.020 --> 3:10:24.020]  I'm just going to leave that open for imagination
[3:10:24.020 --> 3:10:28.020]  But I'm sure I've already hinted enough
[3:10:28.020 --> 3:10:30.020]  I'm going to be there tomorrow, folks
[3:10:30.020 --> 3:10:32.020]  I always tell the enemy when I'm coming
[3:10:32.020 --> 3:10:36.020]  So the point is that I like to give my heads up
[3:10:36.020 --> 3:10:38.020]  Going there to do this
[3:10:38.020 --> 3:10:41.020]  Because then they'll overreact and show who they really are too
[3:10:41.020 --> 3:10:44.020]  So the point is I want them to know I'm coming
[3:10:44.020 --> 3:10:47.020]  Anyways, I'm not going to let people know exactly what
[3:10:47.020 --> 3:10:49.020]  But tune in tomorrow
[3:10:49.020 --> 3:10:51.020]  Let's go to Michael Hollingsworth
[3:10:51.020 --> 3:10:53.020]  Michael, tell us briefly about yourself
[3:10:53.020 --> 3:10:56.020]  And then in a snapshot what's really going on there
[3:10:56.020 --> 3:10:58.020]  Thank you very much, Alec
[3:10:58.020 --> 3:11:01.020]  I wanted to open by saying it's both an honor and a privilege to be with you today
[3:11:01.020 --> 3:11:03.020]  Well, it's nice to talk to you
[3:11:03.020 --> 3:11:06.020]  I represent a patriotically based website called Freedom Video USA
[3:11:06.020 --> 3:11:09.020]  That represents a vast number of American patriots
[3:11:09.020 --> 3:11:11.020]  Who are all military veterans, law enforcement veterans
[3:11:11.020 --> 3:11:14.020]  Concerned citizens, people that have not been blinded
[3:11:14.020 --> 3:11:17.020]  By the current presidential administration's smoke and mirrors
[3:11:17.020 --> 3:11:19.020]  We were able to see right through it
[3:11:19.020 --> 3:11:22.020]  And we absolutely have a 100% policy for dispelling
[3:11:22.020 --> 3:11:26.020]  All of the bovine fertilizers that's being spread from corner to corner in this country
[3:11:26.020 --> 3:11:29.020]  I got some emails from some very good friends of mine
[3:11:29.020 --> 3:11:32.020]  Who are just as dedicated the truth as I am
[3:11:32.020 --> 3:11:34.020]  And said, hey man, this is up in your neck of the woods
[3:11:34.020 --> 3:11:36.020]  What's going on up there?
[3:11:36.020 --> 3:11:38.020]  And I looked into it and I was like, APF
[3:11:38.020 --> 3:11:40.020]  I'm like, what does that even mean?
[3:11:40.020 --> 3:11:43.020]  I said police forces are hired by the local jurisdictions
[3:11:43.020 --> 3:11:45.020]  That they work for
[3:11:45.020 --> 3:11:47.020]  There's no such thing as a national police force
[3:11:47.020 --> 3:11:49.020]  But a little bit of background on me
[3:11:49.020 --> 3:11:51.020]  I'm eight years in service in two branches
[3:11:51.020 --> 3:11:53.020]  The U.S. military have worked in the private sector a little bit
[3:11:53.020 --> 3:11:55.020]  Worked for a small time government contractor
[3:11:55.020 --> 3:11:57.020]  Done a lot of civil service work
[3:11:57.020 --> 3:11:59.020]  All of the men in my family are veterans
[3:11:59.020 --> 3:12:01.020]  Have been American patriots and that's our
[3:12:01.020 --> 3:12:03.020]  What so we classify as our number one line of employment
[3:12:03.020 --> 3:12:05.020]  As American patriot, preserver
[3:12:05.020 --> 3:12:07.020]  The representative republic in which we live
[3:12:07.020 --> 3:12:09.020]  So you're up there, you live nearby, you went and checked it out
[3:12:09.020 --> 3:12:11.020]  Give us your take on it
[3:12:11.020 --> 3:12:13.020]  The bottom line started
[3:12:13.020 --> 3:12:15.020]  I started off with an hour and a half long conversation
[3:12:15.020 --> 3:12:17.020]  With a lady by the name of Becky Shea
[3:12:17.020 --> 3:12:19.020]  Who was an almost 20 year reporter with the Billings Gazette
[3:12:19.020 --> 3:12:23.020]  And she was the one who broke the story initially
[3:12:23.020 --> 3:12:25.020]  So I contacted her, she is now currently
[3:12:25.020 --> 3:12:27.020]  The public affairs liaison
[3:12:27.020 --> 3:12:29.020]  For American police force
[3:12:29.020 --> 3:12:31.020]  And I spoke with her
[3:12:31.020 --> 3:12:33.020]  I had a very interesting conversation
[3:12:33.020 --> 3:12:35.020]  It felt like she was trying to sell me something
[3:12:35.020 --> 3:12:37.020]  And I said, how did this happen?
[3:12:37.020 --> 3:12:39.020]  How did you go from being the reporter that broke this story
[3:12:39.020 --> 3:12:41.020]  To being the mouthpiece of the beast
[3:12:41.020 --> 3:12:43.020]  All of the people, all the things I'm reading
[3:12:43.020 --> 3:12:45.020]  All the feedback I'm getting from the people
[3:12:45.020 --> 3:12:47.020]  Of heart and say that they're not interested
[3:12:47.020 --> 3:12:49.020]  In having how they weren't even notified
[3:12:49.020 --> 3:12:51.020]  These people just came out of nowhere
[3:12:51.020 --> 3:12:53.020]  I went from driving a 99 Dodge Intrepid
[3:12:53.020 --> 3:12:55.020]  With a broken tie rod and bad front brakes
[3:12:55.020 --> 3:12:57.020]  To a black Mercedes SUV
[3:12:57.020 --> 3:12:59.020]  With a fuel card that I don't have to pay for
[3:12:59.020 --> 3:13:01.020]  And a substantial increase in salary
[3:13:01.020 --> 3:13:03.020]  So I said, so essentially you sold your soul
[3:13:03.020 --> 3:13:05.020]  And that didn't go over real well
[3:13:05.020 --> 3:13:07.020]  She's quoted in other newspapers
[3:13:07.020 --> 3:13:09.020]  Making similar statements
[3:13:09.020 --> 3:13:11.020]  It seems like she's so
[3:13:11.020 --> 3:13:13.020]  Starstruck by the money
[3:13:13.020 --> 3:13:15.020]  She's even wanting to talk to us
[3:13:15.020 --> 3:13:17.020]  And then meanwhile you've got guys
[3:13:17.020 --> 3:13:19.020]  With foreign accents going
[3:13:19.020 --> 3:13:21.020]  We will tell you nothing
[3:13:21.020 --> 3:13:23.020]  We are bringing in foreign forces
[3:13:23.020 --> 3:13:25.020]  I mean this is, in these newscasts
[3:13:25.020 --> 3:13:27.020]  It's like they're trying to freak everybody out
[3:13:27.020 --> 3:13:29.020]  And it's just
[3:13:29.020 --> 3:13:31.020]  Classic intelligence operation
[3:13:31.020 --> 3:13:33.020]  They admit they're looking at it for the Guantanamo Bay
[3:13:33.020 --> 3:13:35.020]  They have another
[3:13:35.020 --> 3:13:37.020]  Former Supermax
[3:13:37.020 --> 3:13:39.020]  And I need to print that off before we leave
[3:13:39.020 --> 3:13:41.020]  Because I saw it in the news and I haven't Googled it yet
[3:13:41.020 --> 3:13:43.020]  But there's another Supermax in Montana
[3:13:43.020 --> 3:13:45.020]  This is a Supermax
[3:13:45.020 --> 3:13:47.020]  Where they quote have animal rights activists
[3:13:47.020 --> 3:13:49.020]  In U.S. terrorists
[3:13:49.020 --> 3:13:51.020]  And I saw civil rights suits filed
[3:13:51.020 --> 3:13:53.020]  Because they don't let them see their families
[3:13:53.020 --> 3:13:55.020]  Even once a month for visitation
[3:13:55.020 --> 3:13:57.020]  So clearly Montana's the place
[3:13:57.020 --> 3:13:59.020]  Clearly this is being looked at
[3:13:59.020 --> 3:14:01.020]  As where they want to move these assets in
[3:14:01.020 --> 3:14:03.020]  And then it's just red flags
[3:14:03.020 --> 3:14:05.020]  Red flags are shooting up
[3:14:05.020 --> 3:14:07.020]  Then they show up in black SUVs saying
[3:14:07.020 --> 3:14:09.020]  They're the hardened police
[3:14:09.020 --> 3:14:11.020]  Then they have the head of this twin river authority
[3:14:11.020 --> 3:14:13.020]  That's kind of taking over
[3:14:13.020 --> 3:14:15.020]  That's leased it to them
[3:14:15.020 --> 3:14:17.020]  Saying, oh yes
[3:14:17.020 --> 3:14:19.020]  Well it is our wish list for them to be the police
[3:14:19.020 --> 3:14:21.020]  I mean, am I entering the twilight zone?
[3:14:21.020 --> 3:14:23.020]  No sir, you're 100% correct
[3:14:23.020 --> 3:14:25.020]  I spoke with Al Peterson
[3:14:25.020 --> 3:14:27.020]  The executive director of twin rivers authority
[3:14:27.020 --> 3:14:29.020]  Yesterday very briefly
[3:14:29.020 --> 3:14:31.020]  I got him on the phone and I asked him to confirm
[3:14:31.020 --> 3:14:33.020]  The rumors and I said you know
[3:14:33.020 --> 3:14:35.020]  This is a facility that was denied operational status
[3:14:35.020 --> 3:14:37.020]  Because it was not built
[3:14:37.020 --> 3:14:39.020]  In specification to Montana code
[3:14:39.020 --> 3:14:41.020]  In order to house prisoners legally
[3:14:41.020 --> 3:14:43.020]  In the state of Montana you have to have
[3:14:43.020 --> 3:14:45.020]  X amount of square feet per prisoner
[3:14:45.020 --> 3:14:47.020]  In order for it to be considered humane incarceration
[3:14:47.020 --> 3:14:49.020]  This facility did not meet those standards
[3:14:49.020 --> 3:14:51.020]  My question to him was
[3:14:51.020 --> 3:14:53.020]  How is it that the director of the state
[3:14:53.020 --> 3:14:55.020]  Of the city of Hardin could build
[3:14:55.020 --> 3:14:57.020]  Such a facility with such a high price tag
[3:14:57.020 --> 3:14:59.020]  On it and not know
[3:14:59.020 --> 3:15:01.020]  From the blueprint stage
[3:15:01.020 --> 3:15:03.020]  That it wasn't going to be up to specs
[3:15:03.020 --> 3:15:05.020]  So this is all really you're saying red flags
[3:15:05.020 --> 3:15:07.020]  That started popping up dust going okay
[3:15:07.020 --> 3:15:09.020]  Was this facility built specifically with the intention
[3:15:09.020 --> 3:15:11.020]  Is this how far back this plan goes
[3:15:11.020 --> 3:15:13.020]  Is that they already were building these facilities
[3:15:13.020 --> 3:15:15.020]  Because they knew there was no way their state
[3:15:15.020 --> 3:15:17.020]  Was ever going to allow to house them
[3:15:17.020 --> 3:15:19.020]  So yesterday I spoke with the governor
[3:15:19.020 --> 3:15:21.020]  Brian Schweitzer's office who assures me
[3:15:21.020 --> 3:15:23.020]  That absolutely nothing illegal or unconstitutional
[3:15:23.020 --> 3:15:25.020]  Is being allowed to happen I rebutted with
[3:15:25.020 --> 3:15:27.020]  Then why are these people showing up
[3:15:27.020 --> 3:15:29.020]  Having Hardin police department written on their vehicles
[3:15:29.020 --> 3:15:31.020]  Well sir that's a private agency
[3:15:31.020 --> 3:15:33.020]  Dealing with a private town and it's not under
[3:15:33.020 --> 3:15:35.020]  The governor's authority and it's really not
[3:15:35.020 --> 3:15:37.020]  Something that we're liberty to discuss
[3:15:37.020 --> 3:15:39.020]  And we're not with liberty to discuss hypothetical
[3:15:39.020 --> 3:15:41.020]  Situations that says sir hypothetical
[3:15:41.020 --> 3:15:43.020]  Situations we have video of it
[3:15:43.020 --> 3:15:45.020]  We have pictures we have you know
[3:15:45.020 --> 3:15:47.020]  Well that was the thing the California
[3:15:47.020 --> 3:15:49.020]  Paper said
[3:15:51.020 --> 3:15:53.020]  The San Jose Mercury news said
[3:15:53.020 --> 3:15:55.020]  Alex Jones says
[3:15:55.020 --> 3:15:57.020]  They've got police on the side
[3:15:57.020 --> 3:15:59.020]  Of their cars no that's what
[3:15:59.020 --> 3:16:01.020]  The local news is saying
[3:16:01.020 --> 3:16:03.020]  But it's fact we've got pictures
[3:16:03.020 --> 3:16:05.020]  We've got video there's interviews
[3:16:05.020 --> 3:16:07.020]  With citizens of the city of Hardin
[3:16:07.020 --> 3:16:09.020]  That are looking at these vehicles going who the heck are
[3:16:09.020 --> 3:16:11.020]  These people we did not hire these people
[3:16:11.020 --> 3:16:13.020]  We have no idea who they are
[3:16:13.020 --> 3:16:15.020]  Well let me ask you this since you live nearby
[3:16:15.020 --> 3:16:17.020]  Because I've been trying to study this the last three days
[3:16:17.020 --> 3:16:19.020]  Last two days
[3:16:19.020 --> 3:16:21.020]  Am I correct in saying that they had a bond
[3:16:21.020 --> 3:16:23.020]  Issue once to build a prison
[3:16:23.020 --> 3:16:25.020]  People jobs then they did a bait and switch
[3:16:25.020 --> 3:16:27.020]  And said it's a it's a FEMA
[3:16:27.020 --> 3:16:29.020]  Camp and a international
[3:16:29.020 --> 3:16:31.020]  Merck training center
[3:16:31.020 --> 3:16:33.020]  Correct the bond issue that basically what happened
[3:16:33.020 --> 3:16:35.020]  The bond issue has been in court tied up
[3:16:35.020 --> 3:16:37.020]  For several years now because they can't seem to get
[3:16:37.020 --> 3:16:39.020]  The paperwork straightened out for it so they change
[3:16:39.020 --> 3:16:41.020]  Their business plan and this is something that I
[3:16:41.020 --> 3:16:43.020]  Approach Becky Shay with and I says exactly
[3:16:43.020 --> 3:16:45.020]  Who are you planning on training and what
[3:16:45.020 --> 3:16:47.020]  Are you planning on training them to do
[3:16:47.020 --> 3:16:49.020]  And she says well you know that's really not something
[3:16:49.020 --> 3:16:51.020]  I'm liberty to discuss but it's going to be
[3:16:51.020 --> 3:16:53.020]  A matter of police slash detention
[3:16:53.020 --> 3:16:55.020]  Officer type training and I says man what's wrong
[3:16:55.020 --> 3:16:57.020]  With the Montana law enforcement
[3:16:57.020 --> 3:16:59.020]  Academies peace officer standards and training
[3:16:59.020 --> 3:17:01.020]  In our state accredited academy
[3:17:01.020 --> 3:17:03.020]  You can't function in the state of Montana
[3:17:03.020 --> 3:17:05.020]  I don't know how it runs in other places but in the state
[3:17:05.020 --> 3:17:07.020]  Of Montana you cannot be a sworn peace
[3:17:07.020 --> 3:17:09.020]  Officer unless you have graduated
[3:17:09.020 --> 3:17:11.020]  The post academy you have to take
[3:17:11.020 --> 3:17:13.020]  The Montana state approved post academy
[3:17:13.020 --> 3:17:15.020]  Before you concern and the counties and cities
[3:17:15.020 --> 3:17:17.020]  Are chartered under the state that's their only
[3:17:17.020 --> 3:17:19.020]  Authorities to the legislature
[3:17:19.020 --> 3:17:21.020]  Correct that is precisely correct
[3:17:21.020 --> 3:17:23.020]  So basically I says you know I call the sheriff's
[3:17:23.020 --> 3:17:25.020]  Office and the gentleman that answered the phone
[3:17:25.020 --> 3:17:27.020]  Was very abrupt with me and said that I'm not
[3:17:27.020 --> 3:17:29.020]  Going to speak to you if you want to know
[3:17:29.020 --> 3:17:31.020]  Anything call the city of heart and so I call
[3:17:31.020 --> 3:17:33.020]  The city of heart and they played the Jimmy
[3:17:33.020 --> 3:17:35.020]  Code go tell Bobby go tell Mary game with me
[3:17:35.020 --> 3:17:37.020]  And pushed me off to 30 different people
[3:17:37.020 --> 3:17:39.020]  And any time that happens that's basically
[3:17:39.020 --> 3:17:41.020]  In the seven tenants special operations
[3:17:41.020 --> 3:17:43.020]  You have one of them called UW or unconventional
[3:17:43.020 --> 3:17:45.020]  Warfare and essentially what happens
[3:17:45.020 --> 3:17:47.020]  With unconventional warfare is the disinformation
[3:17:47.020 --> 3:17:49.020]  The psychological operations where you
[3:17:49.020 --> 3:17:51.020]  Will go in and set
[3:17:51.020 --> 3:17:53.020]  You know like the fuse if you will creating
[3:17:53.020 --> 3:17:55.020]  The need and getting people to see things
[3:17:55.020 --> 3:17:57.020]  From your perspective so that when you come in
[3:17:57.020 --> 3:17:59.020]  And offer your services that you had planned
[3:17:59.020 --> 3:18:01.020]  All along that these people are going to
[3:18:01.020 --> 3:18:03.020]  You know to a screaming thunderous applause
[3:18:03.020 --> 3:18:05.020]  They're going to welcome you and that's
[3:18:05.020 --> 3:18:07.020]  So you set the grounds work of problem
[3:18:07.020 --> 3:18:09.020]  Reaction solution precisely now the other
[3:18:09.020 --> 3:18:11.020]  Thing that's very critical that everybody
[3:18:11.020 --> 3:18:13.020]  In the United States in the world needs to know
[3:18:13.020 --> 3:18:15.020]  Is that my heart in Montana was not the only
[3:18:15.020 --> 3:18:17.020]  That they planned on doing this and now
[3:18:17.020 --> 3:18:19.020]  Something that came straight out of Miss Shea
[3:18:19.020 --> 3:18:21.020]  Oh that's key. I asked her I said
[3:18:21.020 --> 3:18:23.020]  So basically what you guys did is you targeted
[3:18:23.020 --> 3:18:25.020]  Heart in Montana because you realized that
[3:18:25.020 --> 3:18:27.020]  Its financial infrastructure was collapsing
[3:18:27.020 --> 3:18:29.020]  And the city was about to implode and they had
[3:18:29.020 --> 3:18:31.020]  No money and they've been taking handouts
[3:18:31.020 --> 3:18:33.020]  From the state for X number of years and she goes
[3:18:33.020 --> 3:18:35.020]  I don't know that targeted was a good word
[3:18:35.020 --> 3:18:37.020]  But she says I think it was more that we did a
[3:18:37.020 --> 3:18:39.020]  Complex financial evaluations of all
[3:18:39.020 --> 3:18:41.020]  Of the locations that we were planning
[3:18:41.020 --> 3:18:43.020]  And it's the poorest county
[3:18:43.020 --> 3:18:45.020]  As jail will save you then they bait
[3:18:45.020 --> 3:18:47.020]  And switch it and turn it into a command center
[3:18:47.020 --> 3:18:49.020]  For American police force
[3:18:49.020 --> 3:18:51.020]  To spill out a society
[3:18:51.020 --> 3:18:53.020]  Implodes the Mercks are here
[3:18:53.020 --> 3:18:55.020]  Precisely now you'll notice very carefully
[3:18:55.020 --> 3:18:57.020]  If you go to their website you will see
[3:18:57.020 --> 3:18:59.020]  An emblazoned logo on their berets
[3:18:59.020 --> 3:19:01.020]  On the side of their vehicle that has a two
[3:19:01.020 --> 3:19:03.020]  Headed eagle that is the Serbian royal family
[3:19:03.020 --> 3:19:05.020]  Crest
[3:19:05.020 --> 3:19:07.020]  That's so basically this Michael Hilton
[3:19:07.020 --> 3:19:09.020]  Guy refers to himself as Captain Michael Hilton
[3:19:09.020 --> 3:19:11.020]  You know stands about five foot one
[3:19:11.020 --> 3:19:13.020]  Maybe 150 pounds
[3:19:13.020 --> 3:19:15.020]  Soak and wet
[3:19:15.020 --> 3:19:17.020]  This gentleman has got a very
[3:19:17.020 --> 3:19:19.020]  Not so personal attitude about it
[3:19:19.020 --> 3:19:21.020]  And I asked Michelle in our conversation
[3:19:21.020 --> 3:19:23.020]  I said don't you think it's rather deceptive
[3:19:23.020 --> 3:19:25.020]  To play all these I'm not going to tell you where
[3:19:25.020 --> 3:19:27.020]  Our funding comes from I'm not going to tell you
[3:19:27.020 --> 3:19:29.020]  Who our parent company is I said you know
[3:19:29.020 --> 3:19:31.020]  All this cloak and dagger and smoke and mirrors
[3:19:31.020 --> 3:19:33.020]  I said how do you expect people to trust you
[3:19:33.020 --> 3:19:35.020]  And she says well they really don't have to
[3:19:35.020 --> 3:19:37.020]  Because it's basically already cut and dried
[3:19:37.020 --> 3:19:39.020]  With their city council
[3:19:39.020 --> 3:19:41.020]  Stay there final segment we got another interview

[3:21:07.020 --> 3:21:09.020]  Banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[3:21:09.020 --> 3:21:11.020]  Won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[3:21:11.020 --> 3:21:13.020]  That's right, gold has been available
[3:21:13.020 --> 3:21:15.020]  To be placed in IRAs since 1986
[3:21:15.020 --> 3:21:17.020]  Yet still, the financial
[3:21:17.020 --> 3:21:19.020]  Industry refuses to recognize
[3:21:19.020 --> 3:21:21.020]  The value of real hard assets for your retirement

[3:21:27.020 --> 3:21:29.020]  Yet no word about IRAs
[3:21:29.020 --> 3:21:31.020]  Perhaps the financial institutions

[3:22:57.020 --> 3:22:59.020]  The President of the United States
[3:22:59.020 --> 3:23:01.020]  Has declared martial law under Executive Order 11,004
[3:23:01.020 --> 3:23:03.020]  Will they do it?
[3:23:03.020 --> 3:23:05.020]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[3:23:05.020 --> 3:23:07.020]  We all pray they stand down
[3:23:07.020 --> 3:23:09.020]  But an engineered crisis seems more
[3:23:09.020 --> 3:23:11.020]  Likely with each passing day
[3:23:11.020 --> 3:23:13.020]  Think it can't happen here?

[3:23:19.020 --> 3:23:21.020]  Likely with each passing day
[3:23:21.020 --> 3:23:23.020]  Think it can't happen here?

[3:24:09.020 --> 3:24:11.020]  Along with all the latest flu developments here on air
[3:24:11.020 --> 3:24:13.020]  Burmese will be sitting in live

[3:24:15.020 --> 3:24:17.020]  But
[3:24:17.020 --> 3:24:19.020]  Then you have the lady running for mayor
[3:24:19.020 --> 3:24:21.020]  Whose husband was the head of the facility
[3:24:21.020 --> 3:24:23.020]  Who's now been removed
[3:24:23.020 --> 3:24:25.020]  I mean, this just gets crazier and crazier
[3:24:25.020 --> 3:24:27.020]  Sir
[3:24:27.020 --> 3:24:29.020]  Yeah, it sure does
[3:24:29.020 --> 3:24:31.020]  The Smith gentlemen
[3:24:31.020 --> 3:24:33.020]  Was there the executive director
[3:24:33.020 --> 3:24:35.020]  Of Twin Rivers, Two Rivers Authority
[3:24:35.020 --> 3:24:37.020]  You know, they say
[3:24:37.020 --> 3:24:39.020]  He was put on administrative leave
[3:24:39.020 --> 3:24:41.020]  Without so much as an explanation
[3:24:41.020 --> 3:24:43.020]  And I've tried on all of the three
[3:24:43.020 --> 3:24:45.020]  Numbers I've been able to obtain
[3:24:45.020 --> 3:24:47.020]  I get nothing but voicemail
[3:24:47.020 --> 3:24:49.020]  And this is his wife
[3:24:49.020 --> 3:24:51.020]  Who is the current mayoral candidate
[3:24:51.020 --> 3:24:53.020]  Is attempting to
[3:24:53.020 --> 3:24:55.020]  The statement she made was
[3:24:55.020 --> 3:24:57.020]  Don't worry everybody, citizens of the park
[3:24:57.020 --> 3:24:59.020]  And the truth about APF will be exposed soon enough
[3:24:59.020 --> 3:25:01.020]  And then just go with the flow
[3:25:01.020 --> 3:25:03.020]  That was a direct quote from her
[3:25:03.020 --> 3:25:05.020]  That can be found on her
[3:25:05.020 --> 3:25:07.020]  That's her on the TV news
[3:25:07.020 --> 3:25:09.020]  And the state house is saying
[3:25:09.020 --> 3:25:11.020]  We're not getting answers
[3:25:11.020 --> 3:25:13.020]  Yeah, well that's the thing
[3:25:13.020 --> 3:25:15.020]  This last two days that I've spent
[3:25:15.020 --> 3:25:17.020]  Having all these canned answers
[3:25:17.020 --> 3:25:19.020]  From Governor Schweitzer, from Senator Baucus
[3:25:19.020 --> 3:25:21.020]  And it's all the same thing
[3:25:21.020 --> 3:25:23.020]  Well sir, we're very honored that you took the time to contact us today
[3:25:23.020 --> 3:25:25.020]  We'll be glad to send you a rubber stamped form letter
[3:25:25.020 --> 3:25:27.020]  And blah blah blah
[3:25:27.020 --> 3:25:29.020]  We're actually not really at liberty to talk about that
[3:25:29.020 --> 3:25:31.020]  The biggest, scariest and most disgusting thing
[3:25:31.020 --> 3:25:33.020]  About this Mr. Jones
[3:25:33.020 --> 3:25:35.020]  Is that they say the same thing
[3:25:35.020 --> 3:25:37.020]  This is a private deal between the city of Haver
[3:25:37.020 --> 3:25:39.020]  And American police force
[3:25:39.020 --> 3:25:41.020]  And Two Rivers Authority
[3:25:41.020 --> 3:25:43.020]  So I asked this guy
[3:25:43.020 --> 3:25:45.020]  That's what you're telling me
[3:25:45.020 --> 3:25:47.020]  That the governor of my state
[3:25:47.020 --> 3:25:49.020]  The supreme authority of my state
[3:25:49.020 --> 3:25:51.020]  Has absolutely no interest in the fact
[3:25:51.020 --> 3:25:53.020]  That there are foreign mercenaries
[3:25:53.020 --> 3:25:55.020]  Who have set up a forward operating base
[3:25:55.020 --> 3:25:57.020]  Essentially, it's a hardened structure
[3:25:57.020 --> 3:25:59.020]  As surrounded by
[3:25:59.020 --> 3:26:01.020]  There's an application of authority
[3:26:01.020 --> 3:26:03.020]  They're just saying do whatever you want
[3:26:03.020 --> 3:26:05.020]  And then you said this commander
[3:26:05.020 --> 3:26:07.020]  He calls himself some type of commander
[3:26:07.020 --> 3:26:09.020]  He's like
[3:26:09.020 --> 3:26:11.020]  And you're saying he gets really mad
[3:26:11.020 --> 3:26:13.020]  And tries to talk to him
[3:26:13.020 --> 3:26:15.020]  Well, I haven't had the ability to personally talk to him
[3:26:15.020 --> 3:26:17.020]  But what I have seen in the interviews
[3:26:17.020 --> 3:26:19.020]  Is that he's very short, he's very brief
[3:26:19.020 --> 3:26:21.020]  And very matter of factly with the media representatives
[3:26:21.020 --> 3:26:23.020]  That have spoken with him
[3:26:23.020 --> 3:26:25.020]  Who is the old guy with the foreign acts
[3:26:25.020 --> 3:26:27.020]  And always smoking cigarettes with everyone
[3:26:27.020 --> 3:26:29.020]  The town officials are always groveling
[3:26:29.020 --> 3:26:31.020]  Their body languages
[3:26:31.020 --> 3:26:33.020]  Okay, that's him
[3:26:33.020 --> 3:26:35.020]  And then at the top
[3:26:35.020 --> 3:26:37.020]  The gentleman with gray hair
[3:26:37.020 --> 3:26:39.020]  Is Al Peterson
[3:26:39.020 --> 3:26:41.020]  Two rivers authority
[3:26:41.020 --> 3:26:43.020]  He physically cursed me out over the phone
[3:26:43.020 --> 3:26:45.020]  Told me I was way out in left field
[3:26:45.020 --> 3:26:47.020]  Was full of bovine feces
[3:26:47.020 --> 3:26:49.020]  And told me exactly where I could go
[3:26:49.020 --> 3:26:51.020]  Stuff myself and then hung up on me
[3:26:51.020 --> 3:26:53.020]  So I called him back twice
[3:26:53.020 --> 3:26:55.020]  He hung up on me again third time
[3:26:55.020 --> 3:26:57.020]  I left him a message and said sir you're neither
[3:26:57.020 --> 3:26:59.020]  Away from your phone nor are you dealing with another client
[3:26:59.020 --> 3:27:01.020]  You were deliberately ignoring a call from a concerned American patriot
[3:27:01.020 --> 3:27:03.020]  While you're harboring mercenaries on American soil
[3:27:03.020 --> 3:27:05.020]  Well, here's the bottom line
[3:27:05.020 --> 3:27:07.020]  Where is this going?
[3:27:07.020 --> 3:27:09.020]  When they think that they own the town
[3:27:09.020 --> 3:27:11.020]  This is like something out of an old western
[3:27:11.020 --> 3:27:13.020]  How is this going to end?
[3:27:13.020 --> 3:27:15.020]  Black SUVs riding around
[3:27:15.020 --> 3:27:17.020]  Ruling us?
[3:27:17.020 --> 3:27:19.020]  That's our summerization at this point
[3:27:19.020 --> 3:27:21.020]  We've been observing these conditions
[3:27:21.020 --> 3:27:23.020]  As they magnify magnetomically on a daily basis
[3:27:23.020 --> 3:27:25.020]  Everything that Obama has told us
[3:27:25.020 --> 3:27:27.020]  Has been a bald-faced lie
[3:27:27.020 --> 3:27:29.020]  He very queer and now this is imperative
[3:27:29.020 --> 3:27:31.020]  He very clearly said in one of his addresses
[3:27:31.020 --> 3:27:33.020]  To the nation
[3:27:33.020 --> 3:27:35.020]  We need a private military force
[3:27:35.020 --> 3:27:37.020]  A private police force that is just as well
[3:27:37.020 --> 3:27:39.020]  Equipped and trained as our modern military
[3:27:39.020 --> 3:27:41.020]  Just as big, just as strong
[3:27:41.020 --> 3:27:43.020]  Just as big, just as strong
[3:27:43.020 --> 3:27:45.020]  Well by God here they are, they're called APF
[3:27:45.020 --> 3:27:47.020]  Here they are, merc
[3:27:47.020 --> 3:27:49.020]  And she told you, their spokeswoman
[3:27:49.020 --> 3:27:51.020]  The former Billings Gazette reporter
[3:27:51.020 --> 3:27:53.020]  She said, oh this is nationwide
[3:27:53.020 --> 3:27:55.020]  In no uncertain terms
[3:27:55.020 --> 3:27:57.020]  She was very evasive about it
[3:27:57.020 --> 3:27:59.020]  But she slipped on a couple of occasions and said
[3:27:59.020 --> 3:28:01.020]  That this is how they had done the evaluations
[3:28:01.020 --> 3:28:03.020]  For centers from coast to coast
[3:28:03.020 --> 3:28:05.020]  But they had several other states
[3:28:05.020 --> 3:28:07.020]  They were looking at doing the same thing
[3:28:07.020 --> 3:28:09.020]  And then they won't say where their money comes from
[3:28:09.020 --> 3:28:11.020]  But predominantly their
[3:28:11.020 --> 3:28:13.020]  On the news they say
[3:28:13.020 --> 3:28:15.020]  Hundreds, one newscast said
[3:28:15.020 --> 3:28:17.020]  500, one said more
[3:28:17.020 --> 3:28:19.020]  Personnel are about to arrive
[3:28:19.020 --> 3:28:21.020]  But no one can be told anything about them
[3:28:21.020 --> 3:28:23.020]  The current statistics that we've been able to
[3:28:23.020 --> 3:28:25.020]  Obtain is that there are approximately
[3:28:25.020 --> 3:28:27.020]  50 to 60 current active agents
[3:28:27.020 --> 3:28:29.020]  For American police force
[3:28:29.020 --> 3:28:31.020]  Within the boundaries of the United States
[3:28:31.020 --> 3:28:33.020]  1,600 operators worldwide
[3:28:33.020 --> 3:28:35.020]  They claim to be able to land
[3:28:35.020 --> 3:28:37.020]  A battalion-sized special forces
[3:28:37.020 --> 3:28:39.020]  Qualified element of troops within 72 hours
[3:28:39.020 --> 3:28:41.020]  Anywhere globally
[3:28:41.020 --> 3:28:43.020]  And that's
[3:28:43.020 --> 3:28:45.020]  A battalion, that's an awful lot
[3:28:45.020 --> 3:28:47.020]  Of special forces qualified troops
[3:28:47.020 --> 3:28:49.020]  The other thing that we're kind of leery
[3:28:49.020 --> 3:28:51.020]  About this whole thing is that
[3:28:51.020 --> 3:28:53.020]  When I directly approached her and I said
[3:28:53.020 --> 3:28:55.020]  So what about these potential ties that we've discovered
[3:28:55.020 --> 3:28:57.020]  Through our research on the internet
[3:28:57.020 --> 3:28:59.020]  That say that you were tied to corporations
[3:28:59.020 --> 3:29:01.020]  That three canopies or the
[3:29:01.020 --> 3:29:03.020]  Dynacor Blackwater Security
[3:29:03.020 --> 3:29:05.020]  Now known as XE
[3:29:05.020 --> 3:29:07.020]  And she says
[3:29:07.020 --> 3:29:09.020]  Well, I'm not really at liberty
[3:29:09.020 --> 3:29:11.020]  To discuss any of this
[3:29:11.020 --> 3:29:13.020]  So this group may just be a cut out for a consortium
[3:29:13.020 --> 3:29:15.020]  Of mercs
[3:29:15.020 --> 3:29:17.020]  Basically what it is, this is the smoke screen
[3:29:17.020 --> 3:29:19.020]  When you go to penetrate your enemies
[3:29:19.020 --> 3:29:21.020]  Defensive lines, what you're going to do is probe
[3:29:21.020 --> 3:29:23.020]  Their defenses first to find out where their strong points are
[3:29:23.020 --> 3:29:25.020]  And you do that by creating
[3:29:25.020 --> 3:29:27.020]  Extremely sensitive and extremely
[3:29:27.020 --> 3:29:29.020]  Visible pockets of
[3:29:29.020 --> 3:29:31.020]  You know, little things that you can see
[3:29:31.020 --> 3:29:33.020]  From that point you exploit the weaknesses
[3:29:33.020 --> 3:29:35.020]  Well, yeah, we're getting calls about
[3:29:35.020 --> 3:29:37.020]  Black SUVs, Humvees, troop movements
[3:29:37.020 --> 3:29:39.020]  All over that area
[3:29:39.020 --> 3:29:41.020]  We're going to get more updates from you
[3:29:41.020 --> 3:29:43.020]  In the days to come when I'm on the ground
[3:29:43.020 --> 3:29:45.020]  In Montana, Mr. Halling's words
[3:29:45.020 --> 3:29:47.020]  Your reports at infowars.com
[3:29:47.020 --> 3:29:49.020]  Thanks for your great info
[3:29:49.020 --> 3:29:51.020]  Yeah, Alex, thank you for everything you do
[3:29:51.020 --> 3:29:53.020]  We're on the march
[3:29:53.020 --> 3:29:55.020]  The Empire's on the run

[3:30:03.020 --> 3:30:05.020]  And I want each of you to ask yourself this question
[3:30:05.020 --> 3:30:07.020]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[3:30:07.020 --> 3:30:09.020]  In a recent study conducted
[3:30:09.020 --> 3:30:11.020]  By a major environmental auditor
[3:30:11.020 --> 3:30:13.020]  They found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants
[3:30:13.020 --> 3:30:15.020]  Are present in municipal drinking water
[3:30:15.020 --> 3:30:17.020]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer,
[3:30:17.020 --> 3:30:19.020]  Reproductive, immune
[3:30:19.020 --> 3:30:21.020]  And developmental system diseases
[3:30:21.020 --> 3:30:23.020]  Now what are you going to do about it?

[3:33:17.020 --> 3:33:19.020]  And the sky is grey
[3:33:19.020 --> 3:33:21.020]  Monday through Friday from 11am to 3pm
[3:33:21.020 --> 3:33:23.020]  We're here live on Alex Jones
[3:33:23.020 --> 3:33:25.020]  Joining us, popping in with an update
[3:33:25.020 --> 3:33:27.020]  On the request to get the media to not distort
[3:33:27.020 --> 3:33:29.020]  What he said but actually debate him on
[3:33:29.020 --> 3:33:31.020]  Fair terms, Charlie Sheen joins us
[3:33:31.020 --> 3:33:33.020]  Charlie Sheen, good to have you here
[3:33:33.020 --> 3:33:35.020]  Great to be here Alex, how are you man?
[3:33:35.020 --> 3:33:37.020]  I'm great, I just told you about
[3:33:37.020 --> 3:33:39.020]  That I'm on the White House enemies list
[3:33:39.020 --> 3:33:41.020]  To quote be taken out
[3:33:41.020 --> 3:33:43.020]  Politically
[3:33:43.020 --> 3:33:45.020]  Number 25 on
[3:33:45.020 --> 3:33:47.020]  Number 24 or 25
[3:33:47.020 --> 3:33:49.020]  Now how long is the list
[3:33:49.020 --> 3:33:51.020]  How many names are on there
[3:33:51.020 --> 3:33:53.020]  Or do we even know
[3:33:53.020 --> 3:33:55.020]  25 people are on it
[3:33:55.020 --> 3:33:57.020]  Oh, so you're number 25
[3:33:57.020 --> 3:33:59.020]  I'm number 24, I'm 25
[3:33:59.020 --> 3:34:01.020]  Excellent, so you just made the cut
[3:34:01.020 --> 3:34:03.020]  Congratulations Alex, that's fabulous
[3:34:03.020 --> 3:34:05.020]  Unbelievable
[3:34:05.020 --> 3:34:07.020]  So these knuckleheads would compile a list
[3:34:07.020 --> 3:34:09.020]  You know, singling out people
[3:34:09.020 --> 3:34:11.020]  That are searching for the truth
[3:34:11.020 --> 3:34:13.020]  That are asking these clowns
[3:34:13.020 --> 3:34:15.020]  To be accountable for their actions
[3:34:15.020 --> 3:34:17.020]  It's just unbelievable
[3:34:17.020 --> 3:34:19.020]  So this is the country we live in today
[3:34:19.020 --> 3:34:21.020]  Fabulous, fabulous
[3:34:21.020 --> 3:34:23.020]  It's amazing
[3:34:23.020 --> 3:34:25.020]  And you know, my film that the White House singles out
[3:34:25.020 --> 3:34:27.020]  Exposes Bush and Obama
[3:34:27.020 --> 3:34:29.020]  And just says that Obama's continuing the wars
[3:34:29.020 --> 3:34:31.020]  The Patriot Act, secret arrest
[3:34:31.020 --> 3:34:33.020]  And that we wish Obama would keep his promises
[3:34:33.020 --> 3:34:35.020]  And I guess I get on a list for this
[3:34:35.020 --> 3:34:37.020]  Yeah, you're not making anything up
[3:34:37.020 --> 3:34:39.020]  You're just, you know
[3:34:39.020 --> 3:34:41.020]  You're just pointing to the truth, that's all
[3:34:41.020 --> 3:34:43.020]  Yikes
[3:34:43.020 --> 3:34:45.020]  I mean, I guess
[3:34:45.020 --> 3:34:47.020]  I guess at this point in the game
[3:34:47.020 --> 3:34:49.020]  It's better to be on the enemies list
[3:34:49.020 --> 3:34:51.020]  Absolutely
[3:34:51.020 --> 3:34:53.020]  If you're on the friends list, you got to be employed
[3:34:53.020 --> 3:34:55.020]  By Wall Street, you know
[3:34:55.020 --> 3:34:57.020]  Absolutely
[3:34:57.020 --> 3:34:59.020]  Charlie, let's get into
[3:34:59.020 --> 3:35:01.020]  Your 20 minutes with the president
[3:35:01.020 --> 3:35:03.020]  Megaviral all over the web, millions of views
[3:35:03.020 --> 3:35:05.020]  And your message to the president, the video
[3:35:05.020 --> 3:35:07.020]  The media attacked you
[3:35:07.020 --> 3:35:09.020]  That distorted what you had to say
[3:35:09.020 --> 3:35:11.020]  They never really mentioned
[3:35:11.020 --> 3:35:13.020]  Your specific bullet points
[3:35:13.020 --> 3:35:15.020]  Like six of the 10 commission members
[3:35:15.020 --> 3:35:17.020]  Saying that 9-11 was a cover up
[3:35:17.020 --> 3:35:19.020]  Of the criminal investigation
[3:35:19.020 --> 3:35:21.020]  I know this has been frustrating
[3:35:21.020 --> 3:35:23.020]  For you and I
[3:35:23.020 --> 3:35:25.020]  Can you speak to that?
[3:35:25.020 --> 3:35:27.020]  Well, yeah
[3:35:27.020 --> 3:35:29.020]  It's exactly what we anticipated
[3:35:29.020 --> 3:35:31.020]  What happened
[3:35:31.020 --> 3:35:33.020]  That they would attack the man
[3:35:33.020 --> 3:35:35.020]  And not the facts
[3:35:35.020 --> 3:35:37.020]  But it got so blatant
[3:35:37.020 --> 3:35:39.020]  That I think they really showed their hand
[3:35:39.020 --> 3:35:41.020]  In how they
[3:35:41.020 --> 3:35:43.020]  Treated it and how they behaved around it
[3:35:43.020 --> 3:35:45.020]  And I think that
[3:35:45.020 --> 3:35:47.020]  That sends such a
[3:35:47.020 --> 3:35:49.020]  Huge message right there
[3:35:49.020 --> 3:35:51.020]  That you and I
[3:35:51.020 --> 3:35:53.020]  Put forth something
[3:35:53.020 --> 3:35:55.020]  That they just, as I said before
[3:35:55.020 --> 3:35:57.020]  They couldn't disassemble
[3:35:57.020 --> 3:35:59.020]  So they tried to disassemble me
[3:35:59.020 --> 3:36:01.020]  You know
[3:36:01.020 --> 3:36:03.020]  Absolutely
[3:36:03.020 --> 3:36:05.020]  And it's a shame because
[3:36:05.020 --> 3:36:07.020]  We're not naked shouting
[3:36:07.020 --> 3:36:09.020]  From the top of a building
[3:36:09.020 --> 3:36:11.020]  Come debate us
[3:36:11.020 --> 3:36:13.020]  We're issuing a very calm
[3:36:13.020 --> 3:36:15.020]  Offer to just sit down
[3:36:15.020 --> 3:36:17.020]  In an open
[3:36:17.020 --> 3:36:19.020]  And fair debate forum
[3:36:19.020 --> 3:36:21.020]  And hash this thing out
[3:36:21.020 --> 3:36:23.020]  And as you and I were talking
[3:36:23.020 --> 3:36:25.020]  Yesterday
[3:36:25.020 --> 3:36:27.020]  We did get a nibble
[3:36:27.020 --> 3:36:29.020]  We got a nibble
[3:36:29.020 --> 3:36:31.020]  To O'Reilly's credit
[3:36:31.020 --> 3:36:33.020]  But
[3:36:33.020 --> 3:36:35.020]  It's odd to put those two words
[3:36:35.020 --> 3:36:37.020]  In the same sentence
[3:36:37.020 --> 3:36:39.020]  But it just
[3:36:39.020 --> 3:36:41.020]  We haven't reached an agreement
[3:36:41.020 --> 3:36:43.020]  That we set forth
[3:36:43.020 --> 3:36:45.020]  And this afternoon
[3:36:45.020 --> 3:36:47.020]  We're going to be publishing an article
[3:36:47.020 --> 3:36:49.020]  At prismplanet.com
[3:36:49.020 --> 3:36:51.020]  That I and Paul Watson are going to be putting together
[3:36:51.020 --> 3:36:53.020]  And specifically
[3:36:53.020 --> 3:36:55.020]  Now we can tell people
[3:36:55.020 --> 3:36:57.020]  What happened behind the scenes
[3:36:57.020 --> 3:36:59.020]  Larry King live contacted you
[3:36:59.020 --> 3:37:01.020]  Your publicist, they wanted to have you on
[3:37:01.020 --> 3:37:03.020]  But then they couldn't find anybody to come on
[3:37:03.020 --> 3:37:05.020]  And debate you
[3:37:05.020 --> 3:37:07.020]  From the other side, we have those emails
[3:37:07.020 --> 3:37:09.020]  We also then
[3:37:09.020 --> 3:37:11.020]  They always people contacted and said
[3:37:11.020 --> 3:37:13.020]  Yeah, basically come on our show
[3:37:13.020 --> 3:37:15.020]  And we'll slap you around and turn your mic off
[3:37:15.020 --> 3:37:17.020]  Basically you said no
[3:37:17.020 --> 3:37:19.020]  We're going to be publishing that email
[3:37:19.020 --> 3:37:21.020]  You said no, we want to do it
[3:37:21.020 --> 3:37:23.020]  Neutral where I get one minute, you get one minute
[3:37:23.020 --> 3:37:25.020]  Good morning America, looked at it
[3:37:25.020 --> 3:37:27.020]  And then backed off of it
[3:37:27.020 --> 3:37:29.020]  I guess that's the nibble because
[3:37:29.020 --> 3:37:31.020]  If they actually put you on TV
[3:37:31.020 --> 3:37:33.020]  And they know this would be huge ratings
[3:37:33.020 --> 3:37:35.020]  So there's no reason they shouldn't
[3:37:35.020 --> 3:37:37.020]  Except for the fact as we talked about
[3:37:37.020 --> 3:37:39.020]  Your analysis that I think
[3:37:39.020 --> 3:37:41.020]  Spot on dead on
[3:37:41.020 --> 3:37:43.020]  That they know your 20 points are too powerful
[3:37:43.020 --> 3:37:45.020]  And they don't want that discussed
[3:37:45.020 --> 3:37:47.020]  And so they're turning down Charlie Sheen
[3:37:47.020 --> 3:37:49.020]  Wanting to have a debate on national TV
[3:37:49.020 --> 3:37:51.020]  Which any TV producer would kill
[3:37:51.020 --> 3:37:53.020]  To have happen
[3:37:53.020 --> 3:37:55.020]  Well no, I mean
[3:37:55.020 --> 3:37:57.020]  I can't say that
[3:37:57.020 --> 3:37:59.020]  But if you insist then thank you
[3:37:59.020 --> 3:38:01.020]  But yeah, no
[3:38:01.020 --> 3:38:03.020]  As I said, I just think it's
[3:38:03.020 --> 3:38:05.020]  In keeping with
[3:38:05.020 --> 3:38:07.020]  How this
[3:38:07.020 --> 3:38:09.020]  Very
[3:38:09.020 --> 3:38:11.020]  Deceptive and dangerous machine
[3:38:11.020 --> 3:38:13.020]  Operates, you know, and as long as
[3:38:13.020 --> 3:38:15.020]  They've got the media
[3:38:15.020 --> 3:38:17.020]  Under their control
[3:38:17.020 --> 3:38:19.020]  Then this is the
[3:38:19.020 --> 3:38:21.020]  Mountain that we must continue to climb
[3:38:21.020 --> 3:38:23.020]  You know
[3:38:23.020 --> 3:38:25.020]  Well it certainly is
[3:38:25.020 --> 3:38:27.020]  Now maybe O'Reilly
[3:38:27.020 --> 3:38:29.020]  Will agree to debate you somewhere
[3:38:29.020 --> 3:38:31.020]  Or maybe even agree on his own show
[3:38:31.020 --> 3:38:33.020]  To have a moderator in
[3:38:33.020 --> 3:38:35.020]  I mean it would be as big as
[3:38:35.020 --> 3:38:37.020]  Vice President Gore debating
[3:38:37.020 --> 3:38:39.020]  Ross Perot, I guarantee it
[3:38:39.020 --> 3:38:41.020]  I mean they could definitely sell tickets to this thing
[3:38:41.020 --> 3:38:43.020]  But they are afraid
[3:38:43.020 --> 3:38:45.020]  They want a one-sided
[3:38:45.020 --> 3:38:47.020]  Well just like what we saw with Geraldo Rivera
[3:38:47.020 --> 3:38:49.020]  When he was on O'Reilly
[3:38:49.020 --> 3:38:51.020]  I mean they pulled out every stop
[3:38:51.020 --> 3:38:53.020]  Or that other show that they have on
[3:38:53.020 --> 3:38:55.020]  In the middle of the night on Fox
[3:38:55.020 --> 3:38:57.020]  I mean this was the most brutal, savage
[3:38:57.020 --> 3:38:59.020]  Attempted character assassination
[3:38:59.020 --> 3:39:01.020]  I've ever seen
[3:39:01.020 --> 3:39:03.020]  Even worse than the first go around
[3:39:03.020 --> 3:39:05.020]  Back in March of
[3:39:05.020 --> 3:39:07.020]  2006
[3:39:07.020 --> 3:39:09.020]  It's almost like they were sending a message
[3:39:09.020 --> 3:39:11.020]  We warned you back then
[3:39:11.020 --> 3:39:13.020]  And now we're gonna
[3:39:13.020 --> 3:39:15.020]  We're pulling out all the stops
[3:39:15.020 --> 3:39:17.020]  This time
[3:39:17.020 --> 3:39:19.020]  But again if
[3:39:19.020 --> 3:39:21.020]  90% of the comments
[3:39:21.020 --> 3:39:23.020]  Of the
[3:39:23.020 --> 3:39:25.020]  Reader comments and of the viewer comments
[3:39:25.020 --> 3:39:27.020]  Everybody at least 90%
[3:39:27.020 --> 3:39:29.020]  They kept saying
[3:39:29.020 --> 3:39:31.020]  Look at his document
[3:39:31.020 --> 3:39:33.020]  Look at his facts, look at his data
[3:39:33.020 --> 3:39:35.020]  Look at his information
[3:39:35.020 --> 3:39:37.020]  Stop going after him
[3:39:37.020 --> 3:39:39.020]  So people are
[3:39:39.020 --> 3:39:41.020]  Very much aware of
[3:39:41.020 --> 3:39:43.020]  This sham tactic
[3:39:43.020 --> 3:39:45.020]  Well in the final equation
[3:39:45.020 --> 3:39:47.020]  Tens of millions of people
[3:39:47.020 --> 3:39:49.020]  Conservatively
[3:39:49.020 --> 3:39:51.020]  Read your letter, read your bullet points
[3:39:51.020 --> 3:39:53.020]  And it has definitely
[3:39:53.020 --> 3:39:55.020]  Re-energized 9-11 truth
[3:39:55.020 --> 3:39:57.020]  It was still growing but not as fast
[3:39:57.020 --> 3:39:59.020]  As it has been
[3:39:59.020 --> 3:40:01.020]  You knew you'd be attacked
[3:40:01.020 --> 3:40:03.020]  For this
[3:40:03.020 --> 3:40:05.020]  Why did you do it in the final equation?
[3:40:05.020 --> 3:40:07.020]  In the final equation
[3:40:07.020 --> 3:40:09.020]  I
[3:40:09.020 --> 3:40:11.020]  Have to say that the message
[3:40:11.020 --> 3:40:13.020]  I was trying to get out was
[3:40:13.020 --> 3:40:15.020]  New president, new investigation
[3:40:19.020 --> 3:40:21.020]  I think that's pretty much it at the end of the day
[3:40:21.020 --> 3:40:23.020]  New president, new investigation
[3:40:23.020 --> 3:40:25.020]  And as you said
[3:40:25.020 --> 3:40:27.020]  In the letter, you voted for Obama
[3:40:27.020 --> 3:40:29.020]  You believed all the things he said he was going to do
[3:40:29.020 --> 3:40:31.020]  Has he kept any of his promises
[3:40:31.020 --> 3:40:33.020]  Charlie?
[3:40:33.020 --> 3:40:35.020]  None that I've observed
[3:40:35.020 --> 3:40:37.020]  If you discover
[3:40:37.020 --> 3:40:39.020]  Any that were kept
[3:40:39.020 --> 3:40:41.020]  Please bring me up to speed
[3:40:41.020 --> 3:40:43.020]  Believe me, I'd like to
[3:40:43.020 --> 3:40:45.020]  Find some, now he's saying Guantanamo
[3:40:45.020 --> 3:40:47.020]  Is going to stay open and they're going to set up camps here
[3:40:47.020 --> 3:40:49.020]  In the US, shifting gears
[3:40:49.020 --> 3:40:51.020]  You've got to get back on the set
[3:40:51.020 --> 3:40:53.020]  You guys are rehearsing for two and a half men
[3:40:53.020 --> 3:40:55.020]  The top rated comedy TV show
[3:40:55.020 --> 3:40:57.020]  Right now
[3:40:57.020 --> 3:40:59.020]  The contest, now we announced a few weeks ago
[3:40:59.020 --> 3:41:01.020]  We're going to have it, Monday is going to be the official date
[3:41:01.020 --> 3:41:03.020]  Charlie is
[3:41:03.020 --> 3:41:05.020]  Judge Jury
[3:41:05.020 --> 3:41:07.020]  Executioner, he is the guy that is going to watch
[3:41:07.020 --> 3:41:09.020]  The videos
[3:41:09.020 --> 3:41:11.020]  And people are going to have
[3:41:11.020 --> 3:41:13.020]  One month from next Monday
[3:41:13.020 --> 3:41:15.020]  We're going to have a special website that we're building
[3:41:15.020 --> 3:41:17.020]  Just for this
[3:41:17.020 --> 3:41:19.020]  And I'll have the specific rules that Charlie and I
[3:41:19.020 --> 3:41:21.020]  Are finalizing the next few days
[3:41:21.020 --> 3:41:23.020]  Specifically Charlie, what are you looking for
[3:41:23.020 --> 3:41:25.020]  In the winner here
[3:41:25.020 --> 3:41:27.020]  I'm just looking
[3:41:27.020 --> 3:41:29.020]  For
[3:41:29.020 --> 3:41:31.020]  The most interesting
[3:41:31.020 --> 3:41:33.020]  Interpretation
[3:41:33.020 --> 3:41:35.020]  Of the material
[3:41:35.020 --> 3:41:37.020]  And
[3:41:37.020 --> 3:41:39.020]  I'm not looking
[3:41:39.020 --> 3:41:41.020]  For people to turn it into a song
[3:41:41.020 --> 3:41:43.020]  That might be a little much
[3:41:43.020 --> 3:41:45.020]  But I'm just looking for
[3:41:45.020 --> 3:41:47.020]  Perhaps the most interesting interpretation
[3:41:47.020 --> 3:41:49.020]  The most passionate interpretation
[3:41:49.020 --> 3:41:51.020]  Just something that
[3:41:51.020 --> 3:41:53.020]  You and I might not
[3:41:53.020 --> 3:41:55.020]  Have thought of
[3:41:55.020 --> 3:41:57.020]  In imagining what people are going to present
[3:41:57.020 --> 3:41:59.020]  How they're going to construct
[3:41:59.020 --> 3:42:01.020]  This thing, how they're going to create it and present it
[3:42:01.020 --> 3:42:03.020]  And again
[3:42:03.020 --> 3:42:05.020]  People don't have to
[3:42:05.020 --> 3:42:07.020]  Have to be off book, meaning
[3:42:07.020 --> 3:42:09.020]  No scripts in hand
[3:42:09.020 --> 3:42:11.020]  Because
[3:42:11.020 --> 3:42:13.020]  You and I wrote the damn thing
[3:42:13.020 --> 3:42:15.020]  And there's no way you and I could do it
[3:42:15.020 --> 3:42:17.020]  Memorize, so it is fine
[3:42:17.020 --> 3:42:19.020]  With the document in hand
[3:42:19.020 --> 3:42:21.020]  If it's just read
[3:42:21.020 --> 3:42:23.020]  And again, there's no
[3:42:23.020 --> 3:42:25.020]  There's no
[3:42:25.020 --> 3:42:27.020]  Constraints
[3:42:27.020 --> 3:42:29.020]  On
[3:42:29.020 --> 3:42:31.020]  Race, on sex, on age
[3:42:31.020 --> 3:42:33.020]  On anything
[3:42:33.020 --> 3:42:35.020]  It's all about just whatever two people decide
[3:42:35.020 --> 3:42:37.020]  To sit down and bring this thing to life
[3:42:37.020 --> 3:42:39.020]  And however they do it
[3:42:39.020 --> 3:42:41.020]  Then the one that strikes me
[3:42:41.020 --> 3:42:43.020]  As being the most interesting
[3:42:43.020 --> 3:42:45.020]  That's the one that will award to be the winner
[3:42:45.020 --> 3:42:47.020]  And there's not only the $13,500 prize
[3:42:47.020 --> 3:42:49.020]  Because you want people after taxes
[3:42:49.020 --> 3:42:51.020]  To get 10 grand, very nice of you, Charlie
[3:42:51.020 --> 3:42:53.020]  I was announcing 10 grand
[3:42:53.020 --> 3:42:55.020]  And then you corrected me during the break
[3:42:55.020 --> 3:42:57.020]  You said, well, make it so they get
[3:42:57.020 --> 3:42:59.020]  Actually 10 grand
[3:42:59.020 --> 3:43:01.020]  After taxes, second place will get a thousand
[3:43:01.020 --> 3:43:03.020]  Third place will get 500
[3:43:03.020 --> 3:43:05.020]  There's a secret surprise
[3:43:05.020 --> 3:43:07.020]  As well
[3:43:07.020 --> 3:43:09.020]  That is going to be done with
[3:43:09.020 --> 3:43:11.020]  Some of the best videos that we're going to
[3:43:11.020 --> 3:43:13.020]  Just leave as a surprise until
[3:43:13.020 --> 3:43:15.020]  Later, but this is a contest
[3:43:15.020 --> 3:43:17.020]  Everybody wants to be involved in
[3:43:17.020 --> 3:43:19.020]  I want to see hundreds and hundreds
[3:43:19.020 --> 3:43:21.020]  I know we're going to see hundreds and hundreds of entries
[3:43:21.020 --> 3:43:23.020]  We've seen hundreds when I have a thousand-dollar prize
[3:43:23.020 --> 3:43:25.020]  And so
[3:43:25.020 --> 3:43:27.020]  In closing
[3:43:27.020 --> 3:43:29.020]  I could paraphrase your idea
[3:43:29.020 --> 3:43:31.020]  But we're doing this
[3:43:31.020 --> 3:43:33.020]  Obviously so that there are hundreds
[3:43:33.020 --> 3:43:35.020]  Of viral videos with the 20 bullet points
[3:43:35.020 --> 3:43:37.020]  And people can boil down
[3:43:37.020 --> 3:43:39.020]  The 15 pages or so
[3:43:39.020 --> 3:43:41.020]  They don't have to read the entire document
[3:43:41.020 --> 3:43:43.020]  We're going to see closing comments on that
[3:43:43.020 --> 3:43:45.020]  Well, yeah
[3:43:45.020 --> 3:43:47.020]  I'm hoping because there's been a bit of a low
[3:43:47.020 --> 3:43:49.020]  Since the publishing of the document
[3:43:49.020 --> 3:43:51.020]  And the launching of the video
[3:43:51.020 --> 3:43:53.020]  I'm hoping that this brings it back
[3:43:53.020 --> 3:43:55.020]  To the forefront
[3:43:55.020 --> 3:43:57.020]  And floods the internet
[3:43:57.020 --> 3:43:59.020]  With all these new videos and all this new energy
[3:43:59.020 --> 3:44:01.020]  And really
[3:44:03.020 --> 3:44:05.020]  Is a slap in the face to Google
[3:44:05.020 --> 3:44:07.020]  And what they did to YouTube
[3:44:07.020 --> 3:44:09.020]  And what they did to that video
[3:44:09.020 --> 3:44:11.020]  Yeah, they clearly put the brakes on
[3:44:11.020 --> 3:44:13.020]  It was obvious, I mean, come on
[3:44:13.020 --> 3:44:15.020]  It was 100,000 views a day
[3:44:15.020 --> 3:44:17.020]  And then suddenly it just came to a screeching halt
[3:44:17.020 --> 3:44:19.020]  It was
[3:44:19.020 --> 3:44:21.020]  Yeah, it was a little suspicious to say the least
[3:44:21.020 --> 3:44:23.020]  Well, Charlie, I'm going to let you get back
[3:44:23.020 --> 3:44:25.020]  To what you're doing, but just to give people
[3:44:25.020 --> 3:44:27.020]  A little bit of a hint
[3:44:27.020 --> 3:44:29.020]  This video contest is phase two
[3:44:29.020 --> 3:44:31.020]  And throughout the future
[3:44:31.020 --> 3:44:33.020]  Just so people can
[3:44:33.020 --> 3:44:35.020]  Get a little bit of foreshadowing
[3:44:35.020 --> 3:44:37.020]  We are planning some other interesting things
[3:44:37.020 --> 3:44:39.020]  Yes, we are, yes we are
[3:44:39.020 --> 3:44:41.020]  No, this is not
[3:44:41.020 --> 3:44:43.020]  This is a multi-phase project
[3:44:43.020 --> 3:44:45.020]  And phase one
[3:44:45.020 --> 3:44:47.020]  Complete, phase two is beginning
[3:44:47.020 --> 3:44:49.020]  And phase three will be a big surprise
[3:44:49.020 --> 3:44:51.020]  And phase two
[3:44:51.020 --> 3:44:53.020]  Is all about the listeners
[3:44:53.020 --> 3:44:55.020]  And the viewers taking action
[3:44:55.020 --> 3:44:57.020]  We're giving you the ball, run with it
[3:44:57.020 --> 3:44:59.020]  And again, there's a phase two
[3:44:59.020 --> 3:45:01.020]  To phase two. Charlie, thank you so much
[3:45:01.020 --> 3:45:03.020]  For spending time with us. Not at all
[3:45:03.020 --> 3:45:05.020]  Thank you, Alex, I will talk to you soon
[3:45:05.020 --> 3:45:07.020]  Take care, my friend
[3:45:07.020 --> 3:45:09.020]  There goes Charlie Sheen
[3:45:09.020 --> 3:45:11.020]  Yeah, very...
[3:45:11.020 --> 3:45:13.020]  This guy has got a new idea
[3:45:13.020 --> 3:45:15.020]  And I'm just going to leave it at that
[3:45:15.020 --> 3:45:17.020]  That is much bigger than even the first
[3:45:17.020 --> 3:45:19.020]  And believe me
[3:45:19.020 --> 3:45:21.020]  Now, by the way
[3:45:21.020 --> 3:45:23.020]  I ended up staying up late again last night
[3:45:23.020 --> 3:45:25.020]  Working on the Gardasil stories
[3:45:25.020 --> 3:45:27.020]  And researching what's happening with that
[3:45:27.020 --> 3:45:29.020]  And because we got so many hundreds of entries
[3:45:29.020 --> 3:45:31.020]  I was not going to not watch them all
[3:45:31.020 --> 3:45:33.020]  I finally watched all of them
[3:45:33.020 --> 3:45:35.020]  And I can shoe I got behind
[3:45:35.020 --> 3:45:37.020]  On
[3:45:37.020 --> 3:45:39.020]  Judging all of these
[3:45:39.020 --> 3:45:41.020]  I was supposed to announce it a couple weeks ago
[3:45:41.020 --> 3:45:43.020]  The latest thousand dollar contest
[3:45:43.020 --> 3:45:45.020]  For your political poster
[3:45:45.020 --> 3:45:47.020]  We've already had the other one that paid out on that
[3:45:47.020 --> 3:45:49.020]  The Obama Joker poster
[3:45:49.020 --> 3:45:51.020]  That had huge international success thanks to you
[3:45:51.020 --> 3:45:53.020]  But
[3:45:53.020 --> 3:45:55.020]  I have judged
[3:45:55.020 --> 3:45:57.020]  And at the end of the show today
[3:45:57.020 --> 3:45:59.020]  I'm going to announce the winners tomorrow
[3:45:59.020 --> 3:46:01.020]  I'm going to play the three winning videos
[3:46:01.020 --> 3:46:03.020]  With another article out today or tomorrow about it
[3:46:03.020 --> 3:46:05.020]  I just got so far behind
[3:46:05.020 --> 3:46:07.020]  I bet off more than I can shoe I try to do too much
[3:46:07.020 --> 3:46:09.020]  It's like I'm a mule trying to carry up
[3:46:09.020 --> 3:46:11.020]  A big bag of rocks on my back of a mountain
[3:46:11.020 --> 3:46:13.020]  And I kind of slid down a little bit
[3:46:13.020 --> 3:46:15.020]  But that's okay because I kicked
[3:46:15.020 --> 3:46:17.020]  Ever seen a mule when it gets mad
[3:46:17.020 --> 3:46:19.020]  When it gets mad after it falls down
[3:46:19.020 --> 3:46:21.020]  And kicks back up the hill
[3:46:21.020 --> 3:46:23.020]  I've done a little bit of cowboy
[3:46:23.020 --> 3:46:25.020]  And so I've seen horses and mules and stuff
[3:46:25.020 --> 3:46:27.020]  You know, when they get mad
[3:46:27.020 --> 3:46:29.020]  Well, let's be honest
[3:46:29.020 --> 3:46:31.020]  I was always in there with a hot shot
[3:46:31.020 --> 3:46:33.020]  Or dehorning them and a few times got on a horse
[3:46:33.020 --> 3:46:35.020]  But always got thrown off or hurt
[3:46:35.020 --> 3:46:37.020]  The real cowboys, they'd be in there
[3:46:37.020 --> 3:46:39.020]  With these wild steers
[3:46:39.020 --> 3:46:41.020]  That have been out on a big ranch for years
[3:46:41.020 --> 3:46:43.020]  And ever even been vaccinated to dehorn
[3:46:43.020 --> 3:46:45.020]  They were getting ready for sale
[3:46:45.020 --> 3:46:47.020]  And they had incredible work horses and mules
[3:46:47.020 --> 3:46:49.020]  And they'd lasso one of those cows
[3:46:49.020 --> 3:46:51.020]  Or bulls and start dragging them in
[3:46:51.020 --> 3:46:53.020]  With two horses or one horse
[3:46:53.020 --> 3:46:55.020]  And sometimes that horse would get pulled back
[3:46:55.020 --> 3:46:57.020]  And you see that horse get mad
[3:46:57.020 --> 3:46:59.020]  And those horses would just start bucking
[3:46:59.020 --> 3:47:01.020]  Dragging a cow twice their size
[3:47:01.020 --> 3:47:03.020]  A bull twice their size
[3:47:03.020 --> 3:47:05.020]  Just going wild
[3:47:05.020 --> 3:47:07.020]  That's where that analogy comes from
[3:47:07.020 --> 3:47:09.020]  Of seeing a horse when it gets pissed off
[3:47:09.020 --> 3:47:11.020]  Just amazing
[3:47:11.020 --> 3:47:13.020]  I've seen horses drag cattle through
[3:47:13.020 --> 3:47:15.020]  Fences just getting wild
[3:47:15.020 --> 3:47:17.020]  Side issue
[3:47:17.020 --> 3:47:19.020]  Real cowboying folks
[3:47:19.020 --> 3:47:21.020]  Not the stuff you see at the rodeos
[3:47:21.020 --> 3:47:23.020]  It's even more vicious
[3:47:23.020 --> 3:47:25.020]  That's why I want to make a documentary
[3:47:25.020 --> 3:47:27.020]  About real cowboys
[3:47:27.020 --> 3:47:29.020]  Every time I see a documentary about cowboys
[3:47:29.020 --> 3:47:31.020]  It's some guy that lives on some family ranch
[3:47:31.020 --> 3:47:33.020]  And wearing a big fancy hat
[3:47:33.020 --> 3:47:35.020]  And sure he's going to lasso
[3:47:35.020 --> 3:47:37.020]  But real cowboys are out at 3am
[3:47:37.020 --> 3:47:39.020]  At the bar drunk as a skunk
[3:47:39.020 --> 3:47:41.020]  Then they're driving 18 wheelers hauling gravel
[3:47:41.020 --> 3:47:43.020]  Then they go out 3-4 days a week
[3:47:43.020 --> 3:47:45.020]  With no sleep and getting fist fights
[3:47:45.020 --> 3:47:47.020]  With each other and drag cattle around
[3:47:47.020 --> 3:47:49.020]  These people are maniacs
[3:47:49.020 --> 3:47:51.020]  Side issue
[3:47:51.020 --> 3:47:53.020]  Documentaries about stuff like that
[3:47:53.020 --> 3:47:55.020]  The things I've experienced
[3:47:55.020 --> 3:47:57.020]  It's very macho culture folks
[3:47:57.020 --> 3:47:59.020]  Very macho
[3:47:59.020 --> 3:48:01.020]  You'll just be sitting there when I was like 6
[3:48:01.020 --> 3:48:03.020]  I did it when I was 13, 14, 15
[3:48:03.020 --> 3:48:05.020]  And someone I was 16 on the summers
[3:48:05.020 --> 3:48:07.020]  You'd be sitting there
[3:48:07.020 --> 3:48:09.020]  And these guys were so testosteroneed out
[3:48:11.020 --> 3:48:13.020]  I'm not even going to tell the stories
[3:48:13.020 --> 3:48:15.020]  People wouldn't believe it
[3:48:15.020 --> 3:48:17.020]  They wouldn't believe it
[3:48:17.020 --> 3:48:19.020]  Side issue
[3:48:19.020 --> 3:48:21.020]  Some things are just better not told
[3:48:21.020 --> 3:48:23.020]  I think
[3:48:23.020 --> 3:48:25.020]  Actually people don't believe it anyways
[3:48:25.020 --> 3:48:27.020]  That's weird ass life I've got
[3:48:27.020 --> 3:48:29.020]  I'm now on the White House enemies list
[3:48:29.020 --> 3:48:31.020]  We're getting mega death on
[3:48:31.020 --> 3:48:33.020]  We've woken up naming their new album
[3:48:33.020 --> 3:48:35.020]  Off of in game my film
[3:48:35.020 --> 3:48:37.020]  A lot of people were pointing that out
[3:48:37.020 --> 3:48:39.020]  I actually knew behind the scenes it was named after that
[3:48:39.020 --> 3:48:41.020]  But I wanted to let Dave Mustaine say it on air
[3:48:41.020 --> 3:48:43.020]  I was getting these emails
[3:48:43.020 --> 3:48:45.020]  You lying bastard mega death
[3:48:45.020 --> 3:48:47.020]  Urinates on you
[3:48:47.020 --> 3:48:49.020]  They hate you and I was like yeah right
[3:48:49.020 --> 3:48:51.020]  But look it's just a little bit of satisfaction
[3:48:51.020 --> 3:48:53.020]  In the face of all this danger
[3:48:53.020 --> 3:48:55.020]  To have the White House to be on their enemies list
[3:48:55.020 --> 3:48:57.020]  To see that we're waking up Bruce Willis
[3:48:57.020 --> 3:48:59.020]  And Dave Mustaine
[3:48:59.020 --> 3:49:01.020]  And Charlie Sheen
[3:49:01.020 --> 3:49:03.020]  And Jesse Ventura and Willie Nelson
[3:49:03.020 --> 3:49:05.020]  And just countless other people
[3:49:05.020 --> 3:49:07.020]  I can't even name here because they want to be private
[3:49:07.020 --> 3:49:09.020]  People say oh it's a matter of you're waking up celebrities
[3:49:09.020 --> 3:49:11.020]  That's a gauge of society
[3:49:11.020 --> 3:49:13.020]  And the celebrities aren't fake right wingers
[3:49:13.020 --> 3:49:15.020]  They're fake leftists anymore
[3:49:15.020 --> 3:49:17.020]  And they woke it up to the paradigm
[3:49:17.020 --> 3:49:19.020]  That is just a signpost or an indicator
[3:49:19.020 --> 3:49:21.020]  Or a thermostat showing you the
[3:49:21.020 --> 3:49:23.020]  Mercury's rising for liberty
[3:49:23.020 --> 3:49:25.020]  And so it's a blessing
[3:49:25.020 --> 3:49:27.020]  I'm very honored to be on the White House enemies list
[3:49:27.020 --> 3:49:29.020]  It's just if I get killed
[3:49:29.020 --> 3:49:31.020]  At a carjacking
[3:49:31.020 --> 3:49:33.020]  Or I get found in a hotel room
[3:49:33.020 --> 3:49:35.020]  In a clown suit
[3:49:35.020 --> 3:49:37.020]  With heroin needles hanging out of me
[3:49:37.020 --> 3:49:39.020]  I don't dress in clown suits
[3:49:39.020 --> 3:49:41.020]  Or inject heroin
[3:49:41.020 --> 3:49:43.020]  And I say that because that's the kind of thing they do
[3:49:43.020 --> 3:49:45.020]  They kill you and
[3:49:45.020 --> 3:49:47.020]  Dress you like a woman
[3:49:47.020 --> 3:49:49.020]  Or they kill a woman
[3:49:49.020 --> 3:49:51.020]  And kill you and throw them into a pit
[3:49:51.020 --> 3:49:53.020]  This is the kind of crap
[3:49:53.020 --> 3:49:55.020]  They walk up in a grocery store parking lot
[3:49:55.020 --> 3:49:57.020]  And cap you in the back of the head
[3:49:57.020 --> 3:49:59.020]  And take your wallet
[3:49:59.020 --> 3:50:01.020]  And if that happens
[3:50:01.020 --> 3:50:03.020]  To me because it says Bill Clinton's involved in this
[3:50:03.020 --> 3:50:05.020]  And he runs hit teams
[3:50:05.020 --> 3:50:07.020]  Murder teams
[3:50:07.020 --> 3:50:09.020]  Don't forget the Clinton Chronicles and all of that
[3:50:09.020 --> 3:50:11.020]  If they do kill me
[3:50:11.020 --> 3:50:13.020]  Remember that is a victory
[3:50:13.020 --> 3:50:15.020]  Not a victory for me
[3:50:15.020 --> 3:50:17.020]  I don't want it to happen and I'll never kill myself
[3:50:17.020 --> 3:50:19.020]  And I love life so much it's unbelievable
[3:50:19.020 --> 3:50:21.020]  But
[3:50:25.020 --> 3:50:27.020]  In the final equation
[3:50:27.020 --> 3:50:29.020]  It means we're hurting the New World Order
[3:50:29.020 --> 3:50:31.020]  It means we've got power
[3:50:31.020 --> 3:50:33.020]  It means we're affecting change
[3:50:33.020 --> 3:50:35.020]  It means they're scared of us
[3:50:35.020 --> 3:50:37.020]  I walked out on my front porch last night
[3:50:37.020 --> 3:50:39.020]  And I saw a huge orange and red
[3:50:39.020 --> 3:50:41.020]  And pink thunder heads with the sunset hitting them
[3:50:41.020 --> 3:50:43.020]  Flashing with lightning
[3:50:43.020 --> 3:50:45.020]  The moon was out
[3:50:45.020 --> 3:50:47.020]  Jupiter was out
[3:50:47.020 --> 3:50:49.020]  It was still daylight but Jupiter and the moon were out
[3:50:49.020 --> 3:50:51.020]  And it was just so gorgeous
[3:50:51.020 --> 3:50:53.020]  I could smell the fresh cut grass and the oak trees
[3:50:53.020 --> 3:50:55.020]  And I just love God
[3:50:55.020 --> 3:50:57.020]  I love creation, I love innocence
[3:50:57.020 --> 3:50:59.020]  And I'm so thankful for the position
[3:50:59.020 --> 3:51:01.020]  God's put me in the great honor
[3:51:01.020 --> 3:51:03.020]  Of standing against the beast
[3:51:03.020 --> 3:51:05.020]  In the New World Order's war against humanity
[3:51:05.020 --> 3:51:07.020]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[3:51:07.020 --> 3:51:09.020]  We've got to give them a steak
[3:51:09.020 --> 3:51:11.020]  In creating the kind of
[3:51:11.020 --> 3:51:13.020]  World Order that I think all of us would like to see
[3:51:13.020 --> 3:51:15.020]  The Obama deception
[3:51:15.020 --> 3:51:17.020]  Completely destroys the myth
[3:51:17.020 --> 3:51:19.020]  That Obama is working for the best interest
[3:51:19.020 --> 3:51:21.020]  Of the American people
[3:51:21.020 --> 3:51:23.020]  Well Obama's already fudging
[3:51:23.020 --> 3:51:25.020]  Fudged since day one in this election
[3:51:25.020 --> 3:51:27.020]  If you have a demagogue
[3:51:27.020 --> 3:51:29.020]  With a fanatical mass movement
[3:51:29.020 --> 3:51:31.020]  Of personality cultists
[3:51:31.020 --> 3:51:33.020]  Who is imposing the program of a group
[3:51:33.020 --> 3:51:35.020]  Of bankers and finance older bucks
[3:51:35.020 --> 3:51:37.020]  That's fascism
[3:51:37.020 --> 3:51:39.020]  It's not about left to right
[3:51:39.020 --> 3:51:41.020]  It's about a one world government
[3:51:41.020 --> 3:51:43.020]  This film documents
[3:51:43.020 --> 3:51:45.020]  Who Obama works for

[3:54:30.020 --> 3:54:38.300]  two days ago. Shaking with pleasure. U.S. Ambassador Rice behind him was shaking. Henry Kissinger
[3:54:38.300 --> 3:54:43.660]  was shaking in the audience. This is the New World Order, the eugenics world government
[3:54:43.660 --> 3:54:49.640]  now coming into fruition. We are joined by Dave Mustaine, the founder and lead guitarist
[3:54:49.640 --> 3:54:54.900]  and lead singer of Megadeth. Guitarist, lead singer of Megadeth. Megadeth.com. The new
[3:54:54.900 --> 3:55:02.340]  album is in game and I just want to say that growing up, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35
[3:55:02.340 --> 3:55:08.500]  today, I have always loved Megadeth because the lyrics, I didn't even really understand
[3:55:08.500 --> 3:55:13.140]  them when I was 12, 14, 15 years old, 20 years old. But then as I learned about the New World
[3:55:13.140 --> 3:55:17.820]  Order, the eugenics, the master plan, it really did influence me and I didn't even realize
[3:55:17.820 --> 3:55:22.420]  how much it did. A man way before his time understanding what was coming, most of their
[3:55:22.420 --> 3:55:27.020]  covers are about the U.N. and world government and now it's all happening. Dave Mustaine,
[3:55:27.020 --> 3:55:31.700]  joining us. Thank you so much, sir. You're welcome, Alex. What do you think about what's
[3:55:31.700 --> 3:55:36.260]  happening, world government being announced? It's pretty frightening. It's pretty frightening.
[3:55:36.260 --> 3:55:40.420]  I have to be really careful when I do my interviews and talk about a lot of stuff because you
[3:55:40.420 --> 3:55:45.420]  know, you have to be objective and you have to give people the right to think out of the
[3:55:45.420 --> 3:55:51.500]  box. But I think you and I agree on a lot of things and especially I want to tell you
[3:55:51.500 --> 3:55:59.700]  thanks for inspiring me to look into the whole end game film. And I actually had discovered
[3:55:59.700 --> 3:56:05.260]  this document through watching an inspirational video and then, you know, I know we'd spoken
[3:56:05.260 --> 3:56:12.700]  before and that was a privilege for me because I believe you're a patriot. And I think our
[3:56:12.700 --> 3:56:19.260]  country needs more people like you. And as far as having our record called end game, you
[3:56:19.260 --> 3:56:26.300]  know, I think you're the best way to thank somebody used to, you know, to bring credit
[3:56:26.300 --> 3:56:33.260]  work credit to you. So, thanks. Well, thank you, Dave. Listen, that's just amazing that
[3:56:33.260 --> 3:56:39.340]  you influenced me. And then now with my research, I've influenced you. It's kind of the circle
[3:56:39.340 --> 3:56:46.180]  is complete. Almost. Now we just need one big boom. Well, I tell you, I mean, my wife
[3:56:46.180 --> 3:56:50.860]  is freaked out because she researches all this and she says it's happening. It's it's
[3:56:50.860 --> 3:56:55.860]  it's world government, world taxes, world carbon taxes. We're going to go to break
[3:56:55.860 --> 3:57:04.100]  in a moment. Some stations join us. But Dave, tell us about the new record that's already
[3:57:04.100 --> 3:57:08.540]  from what I've seen the news exploding up the charts in game. Well, the new record we
[3:57:08.540 --> 3:57:13.900]  have recorded in a studio that I own in San Marcos, California. I moved back to San Diego
[3:57:13.900 --> 3:57:19.420]  after the lawsuit with Ellison. I just didn't want to be in the same city with them. So
[3:57:19.420 --> 3:57:26.420]  we moved. And then when I started doing this record, of course, I have a real free world
[3:57:26.420 --> 3:57:30.900]  kind of thinking with my lyrics and stuff. So it was just going to be more of the same
[3:57:30.900 --> 3:57:36.900]  with this record is continuing my idea to raise awareness to help people think, you
[3:57:36.900 --> 3:57:43.540]  know, I may not be right, but you know, I'm certainly right to inspire people to question.
[3:57:43.540 --> 3:57:47.820]  And this record has a lot of topics and it talks about the collapse of the financial
[3:57:47.820 --> 3:57:51.620]  institutions. You know, I went to school and I got licensed by the state and federal government
[3:57:51.620 --> 3:57:57.060]  to work on Wall Street as a stockbroker. And I figured, you know, being in the music business,
[3:57:57.060 --> 3:58:00.260]  most people in the music business aren't very smart when it comes to their money. So I wanted
[3:58:00.260 --> 3:58:04.900]  to be smart and educate myself about that. And along the way, you learn so much, the
[3:58:04.900 --> 3:58:09.820]  more that you willing to exercise your brain, the more that you discover that it's just
[3:58:09.820 --> 3:58:14.340]  frightening, you know, watching the zeitgeist clip and then, you know, knowing all the stuff
[3:58:14.340 --> 3:58:19.020]  that's going on with the marrow and so on and so forth. You know, these are all things
[3:58:19.020 --> 3:58:24.220]  that are pretty tip, you know, pretty atypical conspiracy theories and stuff. But I mean,
[3:58:24.220 --> 3:58:29.300]  if you really think that just one second, okay, maybe this isn't a conspiracy, Dave,
[3:58:29.300 --> 3:58:33.700]  we've got a break. We got to break the satellite makes us break. Stay right there. We'll be
[3:58:33.700 --> 3:58:43.860]  right back with Dave Mustaine, the founder of Megadeth. Stay with us.
[3:58:43.860 --> 3:58:51.460]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:51.460 --> 3:58:55.780]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power? If so, this is
[3:58:55.780 --> 3:58:59.580]  going to be the most important message you will ever hear. Solar power generators are
[3:58:59.580 --> 3:59:03.940]  now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois. These emergency backup
[3:59:03.940 --> 3:59:08.780]  systems provide life saving electrical power when you need it most. Unlike gas generators,
[3:59:08.780 --> 3:59:13.900]  a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes and produces electricity for free. It's like
[3:59:13.900 --> 3:59:18.780]  having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home. Run some pumps, shortwave
[3:59:18.780 --> 3:59:23.940]  radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling. Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms,
[3:59:23.940 --> 3:59:28.700]  brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[3:59:28.700 --> 3:59:33.180]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready. With a solar power generator from Solutions
[3:59:33.180 --> 3:59:41.260]  from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today. That's mysolarbackup.com
