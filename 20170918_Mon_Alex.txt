[00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:21.584]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:24.206]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:28.544 --> 00:00:31.166]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:40.451]  It is Monday, September 18th, 2017, and we have a ton of news for you.
[00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:48.915]  We've got higher education departments wanting to change the words freshmen and upperclassmen because that is triggering.
[00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:53.598]  Of course, we've got the Emmys that just defecated all over themselves last night.
[00:00:54.758 --> 00:00:57.259]  We've got 80 arrests in St.
[00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:01.660]  Louis as they're getting ready for a third day of protests.
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:09.503]  Got all kinds of news talking about China, Venezuela, just international news like that.
[00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:12.624]  Washington Post writer says Trump is literally killing him.
[00:01:12.624 --> 00:01:13.644]  Oh my goodness!
[00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:18.826]  We've got a video of peaceful Muslims beating the crap out of feminist protesters.
[00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:20.207]  So we'll get to all that.
[00:01:20.207 --> 00:01:26.834]  We've got big reports coming from Alex Jones, including one on a CIA whistleblower.
[00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:28.736]  You don't want to miss that.
[00:01:28.736 --> 00:01:33.602]  I think Hillary Clinton is still hanging out in the toilet paper aisle of Costco right now.
[00:01:33.602 --> 00:01:37.065]  I'm not so sure if she's managed to find her way out of that yet.
[00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:38.847]  But that's where Hillary Clinton was last seen.
[00:01:39.648 --> 00:01:46.990]  So we've got all of this news, you've got terror attacks happening in London, but what does the UN say?
[00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.451]  The big question, according to the UN, is what to make of Trump.
[00:01:50.451 --> 00:01:58.653]  I found this so hysterically maddening that the UN would sit here and act like Trump is the biggest problem in the world.
[00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:01.823]  North Korea is threatening America.
[00:02:01.823 --> 00:02:03.885]  Venezuela is completely collapsing.
[00:02:03.885 --> 00:02:09.350]  Radical Islamic terror is attacking in London five times so far this year, all over Europe.
[00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.711]  So you've got all that going on.
[00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:14.094]  But CNN freaks out about the most ridiculous stuff.
[00:02:14.094 --> 00:02:17.318]  So the UN says that, oh, what do we make of Trump?
[00:02:17.318 --> 00:02:18.198]  Trump is a huge deal.
[00:02:18.198 --> 00:02:19.720]  We need to do something about Trump.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.584]  Ignoring all the other problems, as actually Hurricane Maria looks like maybe coming down the same path as Irma.
[00:02:25.365 --> 00:02:33.808]  But CNN likes to attack Trump with low blows, including one video that went viral of a young man that was mowing the White House lawn.
[00:02:33.808 --> 00:02:37.629]  Trump took a step outside, said, hey, congratulations, young entrepreneur.
[00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:44.351]  CNN took this story, ran with it, had to give it a twist and leave it to Mark Dice to get the lemonade out of that lemon.
[00:02:44.351 --> 00:02:45.752]  Here's a report from Mark Dice.
[00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:48.142]  Good evening, I'm Anderson Cooper.
[00:02:48.142 --> 00:02:55.525]  Tonight we have some disturbing footage to show you of President Trump using forced child labor to mow the lawn at the White House.
[00:02:55.525 --> 00:03:04.088]  Our sources tell us the President has tried to keep the budget down and laid off the groundkeepers and decided to use slave labor instead.
[00:03:04.088 --> 00:03:08.750]  Here the President can be seen harassing the poor child slave for not working fast enough.
[00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:21.713]  When the boy's father came out to rescue his son, President Trump said to the man, I could buy your wife, you peasant, and told him to start weed-whacking along the fence or he would send his son to North Korea.
[00:03:21.713 --> 00:03:27.455]  Let's bring in CNN's token black host, a descendant of slaves, Don Lemon, for his reaction.
[00:03:27.455 --> 00:03:28.135]  Don?
[00:03:28.135 --> 00:03:28.995]  Thank you, sweetie.
[00:03:28.995 --> 00:03:29.775]  I mean, Anderson.
[00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:32.156]  Some Republicans say that the boy wanted to mow the ground.
[00:03:32.176 --> 00:03:32.556]  I think?
[00:03:51.013 --> 00:04:15.754]  And the fact is that, again, even if these rumors are true, that the boy volunteered for the job, this is more sexism at the hands of the president, giving the job to a boy instead of a girl, further perpetuating the patriarchal myth that girls aren't strong enough to push a lawnmower, and thus continuing to reinforce these toxic gender roles that are being forced onto our children.
[00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:16.175]  Anderson?
[00:04:16.855 --> 00:04:18.357]  Disturbing indeed.
[00:04:18.357 --> 00:04:22.380]  The former labor reporter for the New York Times had this to say.
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:29.307]  Quote, this is not setting a great signal on child labor, minimum wage, and occupational safety.
[00:04:29.307 --> 00:04:30.308]  End quote.
[00:04:30.308 --> 00:04:34.392]  We reached out to him to confirm and this is not a satirical tweet.
[00:04:34.392 --> 00:04:39.577]  He is 100% serious and he really is from the New York Times.
[00:04:40.077 --> 00:04:42.000]  This is just disgusting!
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.630]  It sure is, and every day now the president seems to confirm our suspicions even when we keep giving him the benefit of the doubt.
[00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.595]  Stay tuned to CNN for the latest bias, I mean breaking news.
[00:04:53.595 --> 00:04:55.278]  Here's Mark Dice with an important message.
[00:04:55.278 --> 00:04:56.039]  That's Mark Dice.
[00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.501]  We'll have more from Alex Jones on the other side.
[00:04:58.621 --> 00:05:02.385]  What exactly is political correctness, and why is it being pushed on the American public?
[00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:08.570]  Well, political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses to control public opinion.
[00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:17.499]  By controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda, but to also ensure that your government-created viewpoint also influences others in a ripple effect.
[00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:20.160]  This is how the power elite and the government stay in power.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.002]  They use psychological manipulation to turn the public into obedient sheeple.
[00:05:24.002 --> 00:05:27.704]  And over time, we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception.
[00:05:27.704 --> 00:05:31.086]  But how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work?
[00:05:31.086 --> 00:05:39.650]  Well, first, the establishment saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted as truth.
[00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.131]  Such as global warming, for example.
[00:05:41.311 --> 00:05:50.503]  Then the establishment suppresses any counter-arguments to their agenda by calling critics kooky, nutjobs, racists, or, in the case of man-made climate change, climate deniers.
[00:05:50.503 --> 00:05:57.011]  You can learn more about this tyranny over the minds of men at Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and our YouTube channel, Resistance News.
[00:05:57.011 --> 00:05:58.193]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:05:59.953 --> 00:06:03.736]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:06:03.736 --> 00:06:11.482]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:06:11.482 --> 00:06:20.108]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:06:20.108 --> 00:06:24.491]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:06:24.491 --> 00:06:29.475]  Pathogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[00:06:30.095 --> 00:06:34.317]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:06:34.317 --> 00:06:37.739]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:48.884]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[00:08:07.435 --> 00:08:11.816]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:11.816 --> 00:08:17.377]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:08:27.163 --> 00:08:29.745]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:08:29.745 --> 00:08:31.866]  Huge news to cover today.
[00:08:31.866 --> 00:08:34.727]  Huge breaking reports from Alex Jones.
[00:08:34.727 --> 00:08:47.214]  A ton of video clips, including all of the Trump derangement that we saw at the Emmys last night, or actually I guess that we didn't see because nobody watched it, and the only reason anybody's talking about it is because of how pathetic they are.
[00:08:47.734 --> 00:08:50.796]  Alex has some news with a CIA whistleblower.
[00:08:50.796 --> 00:08:53.439]  You're going to get that report from Alex Jones.
[00:08:53.439 --> 00:08:57.562]  We're going to have all of the Emmys debacle that was last night.
[00:08:57.562 --> 00:09:00.664]  We've got more on the Trump-Russia probe.
[00:09:00.664 --> 00:09:02.145]  Trump lawyers debating what to do.
[00:09:02.145 --> 00:09:07.349]  Meanwhile, more Clinton-Obama lawyers are going into that probe.
[00:09:07.349 --> 00:09:10.432]  You've got schools now wanting to change their names.
[00:09:11.363 --> 00:09:14.766]  Because they're named after Jefferson and Madison, now they want to change their names.
[00:09:14.766 --> 00:09:18.769]  Yale is swapping out freshmen and upperclassmen with gender-neutral terms.
[00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:20.570]  What the heck is going on on this planet?
[00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.952]  80 arrests as riots gripped St.
[00:09:22.952 --> 00:09:27.356]  Louis for a third day after ex-cops acquittal in fatal shooting.
[00:09:27.356 --> 00:09:29.778]  There's a reason why we keep seeing this.
[00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:31.799]  A lot of it has to do with television
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.121]  The social engineers want you blinded by the background noise.
[00:09:35.121 --> 00:09:35.941]  It's time to turn it off.
[00:10:01.209 --> 00:10:10.436]  Focus intellectually, politically, spiritually on the real architecture of this new world order.
[00:10:10.436 --> 00:10:21.365]  It's time to read the seminal publications and declassifications of the technocrats program.
[00:10:21.365 --> 00:10:30.612]  It's time to realize that InfoWars is not Alex Jones's opinion, but is simply an analysis of what the planetary
[00:10:31.986 --> 00:10:48.400]  Shadow government is establishing and how that planetary system is absorbing, not just human society, but the biospheres of the globe and this ecosystem that is Spaceship Earth.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.384]  Coming up today, Owen Schroyer is going to be hosting with a bunch of important guests and news.
[00:10:53.384 --> 00:10:57.608]  He's going to cover the culture wars and how those are accelerating.
[00:10:57.608 --> 00:10:58.449]  But the backdrop
[00:10:59.858 --> 00:11:19.898]  The most important point to understand from my perspective is that everything you see from MTV and the death culture and the gangbanger culture and the cop killer George Soros culture and the Hollywood anti-family anti-christ system is a function
[00:11:21.059 --> 00:11:44.373]  Of the mode and the psychology and the worldview and the plan of the large tax-free foundations that Congress has even had hearings on, whose plan is to overturn not just civilization, but human operations as they biologically exist in what is called the final revolution, or the end of history.
[00:11:45.453 --> 00:11:51.198]  Anyone listening can just write down these terms I'm giving you, type them into a search engine, and go down the rabbit hole.
[00:11:51.198 --> 00:12:00.267]  Not of something I said, or something Ron Paul said, or something like Matt Drudge said, or Nigel Farage said, or Donald Trump.
[00:12:00.267 --> 00:12:03.810]  But what the globalists themselves have been saying, and a lot of it is 170 years old.
[00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:04.891]  Much of it's from the 1850s.
[00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:05.572]  And the whole plan
[00:12:12.441 --> 00:12:21.950]  You could say it's divinely inspired, but not with a big D. The little d for Diablo.
[00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.274]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a great experiment we're all part of.
[00:12:25.274 --> 00:12:28.016]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[00:12:28.016 --> 00:12:30.198]  We see the ongoing insanity in St.
[00:12:30.198 --> 00:12:30.439]  Louis.
[00:12:32.598 --> 00:12:50.263]  As total racial division is hyped by the corporate media, we see in Dallas, Texas, now one of the Democrats think they can make the state go blue, we see Dallas, Texas, a Democrat stronghold now, preparing to remove Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington.
[00:12:51.789 --> 00:12:57.994]  They're not going to stop until they remove the name of the country, the flag, the whole system, because it's not about stopping any wrongs.
[00:12:57.994 --> 00:13:08.003]  It's about exercising power and using the true openness of the West, our strength as a weakness against us.
[00:13:08.003 --> 00:13:19.572]  That's why we must focus and stoically stand against the social engineering and not give in to virtue signaling or political correctness, even though we want to let people know who are attacking us.
[00:13:20.495 --> 00:13:23.216]  That we don't hate them because of what color they are.
[00:13:23.216 --> 00:13:32.139]  When we give in to all the virtue signaling and say, now I'm not racist, but I understand, and let's be friends, and let's work this out, and let me compromise with you.
[00:13:32.139 --> 00:13:41.381]  You're only giving in to the psychological warfare template, whereby increments, we always compromise, and the establishment never does.
[00:13:41.381 --> 00:13:49.104]  And then the throngs of people we're trying to satisfy, and trying to work with, and trying to live next to, and trying to get along with, they get even more enslaved than ever.
[00:13:49.764 --> 00:13:56.829]  We're all being used as pawns in this and it's time to realize the game and to transcend it.
[00:13:56.829 --> 00:13:58.890]  There's so much other news coming up today.
[00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:10.198]  The latest ridiculous award show with a bunch of out-of-touch Hollywood scum giving each other awards and of course it had record low ratings.
[00:14:10.198 --> 00:14:15.522]  The good news is humanity across the globe is breaking with the globalists.
[00:14:17.526 --> 00:14:26.790]  In fact, when I talk to people who live in third world nations, they're a lot more awake on average than the average American, because they've actually seen the scams, they've been through the frauds.
[00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:33.032]  Just like people that grew up in Eastern Europe under communism, they see, almost to a person, right through all this.
[00:14:33.032 --> 00:14:37.794]  Because they've heard it all before, they've seen the lies, they've been through the process.
[00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:44.097]  Revelation is the best way to learn things, where you just divinely understand something innately, whether it's from God or instinct.
[00:14:46.015 --> 00:14:48.897]  And then of course you can learn by experience.
[00:14:48.897 --> 00:14:51.959]  Sticking your hand down the garbage disposal and turning it on.
[00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:54.962]  Or you can learn by being taught.
[00:14:54.962 --> 00:14:58.924]  You can learn by people that have been through it before.
[00:14:58.924 --> 00:15:01.446]  And that's really the best way to learn.
[00:15:01.446 --> 00:15:08.812]  You can experience it and see it right there for yourself and others who have experienced it can see it for themselves and there's not any denial about what we're facing.
[00:15:10.273 --> 00:15:15.717]  The average people that have bought into this system of political correctness and control do it because they feel powerless.
[00:15:15.717 --> 00:15:24.463]  And they feel like if they learn this new language of having a chip on your shoulder that somehow they'll get ahead when they haven't gotten ahead before.
[00:15:24.463 --> 00:15:26.505]  And I call it the lottery mentality.
[00:15:26.505 --> 00:15:31.929]  And I'm not bashing anybody that's gone out and bought a lottery ticket to have fun and watch the show and have some excitement and be part of something.
[00:15:31.929 --> 00:15:33.990]  But it's designed to screw you over.
[00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:35.692]  It's a tax on the poor.
[00:15:35.692 --> 00:15:38.454]  And the very same people that vote Democrat
[00:15:39.468 --> 00:15:50.817]  And the very same people that buy into political correctness are the very same type of people, whether they be black or white, Hispanic, old, young, that believe that they're going to be okay because the next lottery ticket's going to be their big one and they're going to have $100 million.
[00:15:50.817 --> 00:15:52.258]  They've been scammed.
[00:15:52.258 --> 00:16:07.590]  And what's frustrating is it's in the WikiLeaks, it's in the Facebook documents, it's in all the documents that the social engineers are totally ruthless and are doing all these horrible things worldwide and really hate humanity, but they manipulate folks that want a free ride.
[00:16:09.124 --> 00:16:12.025]  The Republican Party establishment's our enemy.
[00:16:12.025 --> 00:16:14.686]  The Democratic Party establishment's our enemy.
[00:16:14.686 --> 00:16:23.790]  And we've moved so far that people like Donald Trump have arrived on the scene as a manifestation, as a surfer riding the great wave of awakening.
[00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:26.111]  But that doesn't mean we rise or fall with Donald Trump.
[00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:28.192]  We rise and fall on you.
[00:16:28.192 --> 00:16:31.954]  What's in your heart, what's in your mind, seeing through the deception.
[00:16:31.954 --> 00:16:32.654]  Understanding.
[00:16:33.649 --> 00:16:35.090]  The great historical moment we're all in.
[00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:40.472]  Now I'm going to hand this back over to Owen Schroyer.
[00:16:40.472 --> 00:16:42.793]  Over the weekend, Zero Hedge published a big article.
[00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:46.954]  We republished it on Infowars.com with a high-level CIA whistleblower.
[00:16:46.954 --> 00:16:48.115]  Friends with William Binney.
[00:16:49.435 --> 00:16:58.765]  His bona fides are the best out there, exposing how shadow government controls the deep state and what they're trying to establish.
[00:16:58.765 --> 00:17:04.630]  But then I get into the rest of the story, towards the end of the breakdown, about what their endgame is.
[00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:06.052]  That's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:17:06.052 --> 00:17:07.433]  It's very, very important.
[00:17:08.474 --> 00:17:09.295]  I shot it yesterday.
[00:17:09.295 --> 00:17:14.680]  We're going to premiere it here, and then it's going to be posted to Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.844]  And I'm going to get this gentleman on, Mr. Schipp, in the very, very near future.
[00:17:18.844 --> 00:17:22.708]  We're going to get Mr. Benny back on as well, former technical director of the NSA.
[00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:26.312]  But this just confirms the exact architecture that I've already laid out.
[00:17:26.912 --> 00:17:39.503]  Not again because I figured it out myself, but because of the church hearings and the Iran-Contra hearings and others, we get a very good snapshot of how this operates, plus we can see it manifested at point-blank range.
[00:17:39.503 --> 00:17:46.588]  But remember, most of the people in the deep state are controlled as well and are compartmentalized and are actually good people.
[00:17:46.588 --> 00:17:52.433]  It's the shadow government that's key, and it was threatened by Trump and the people's attempt to actually
[00:17:53.794 --> 00:17:55.575]  Take control of our government again.
[00:17:55.575 --> 00:18:02.056]  That's why they're so angry and trying to isolate Trump and so upset that people were able to talk to him, that the public could influence him.
[00:18:02.056 --> 00:18:03.697]  Because they believe it's their right.
[00:18:03.697 --> 00:18:10.339]  They believe they are the global republic and that they own the government and they own the system.
[00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:14.880]  But in truth, they're the very people that have been selling out the country and selling out the republic.
[00:18:15.976 --> 00:18:20.722]  Not just from their own documents that prove it, but from their actions through the popular culture.
[00:18:20.722 --> 00:18:34.498]  And there's now a rebellion within the deep state and the shadow government to stop having culture tools like Hollywood be weapons to absolutely destroy civilization in an attempt to conquer it, while spoiling the very engine of the elite's power itself.
[00:18:35.319 --> 00:18:38.721]  Now back to Owen Schroyer from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:18:38.721 --> 00:18:41.382]  Remember, you are the power of the Info War.
[00:18:41.382 --> 00:18:51.026]  And when you share videos, when you share articles, when you financially support us, when you pray for us, when you speak out, when you take action, when you shoot video reports on the street yourself, it has a huge effect.
[00:18:51.026 --> 00:18:57.029]  So all of you are citizen reporters in this information war, and they can't censor us all, and they can't stop us all.
[00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:58.769]  The fight has been joined.
[00:18:58.769 --> 00:18:59.630]  We're over the target.
[00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:03.091]  And all of you are not essential.
[00:19:03.091 --> 00:19:07.212]  You are absolutely critical and beyond essential.
[00:19:07.212 --> 00:19:10.053]  Without you, there is nothing.
[00:19:10.053 --> 00:19:18.095]  Without you, the most awake group of people on the planet, highly motivated, focused individuals that understand the game, we don't have a hope.
[00:19:18.095 --> 00:19:19.796]  But because of you, we've got way more than a hope.
[00:19:20.697 --> 00:19:27.046]  We've got a promise from God that we can win if we simply take action and do the right thing and trust in Him.
[00:19:27.046 --> 00:19:28.308]  InfoWars.com.
[00:19:28.308 --> 00:19:29.189]  Now back to Owen Schroer.
[00:19:35.879 --> 00:19:45.531]  That MSNBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, all these people, Hollywood, are all fake news, they're all liars, and they do nothing to better this country.
[00:19:45.531 --> 00:19:46.512]  That's why we're here.
[00:19:46.512 --> 00:19:49.656]  We'll have all the news on the other side, including more from Alex Jones.
[00:19:49.656 --> 00:19:50.337]  Don't go anywhere.
[00:19:50.337 --> 00:19:51.859]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:57.813 --> 00:20:02.936]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[00:20:02.936 --> 00:20:08.639]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[00:20:08.639 --> 00:20:13.842]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[00:20:13.842 --> 00:20:15.783]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[00:20:15.783 --> 00:20:18.165]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.

[00:20:37.229 --> 00:20:37.889]  Awesome.

[00:20:40.991 --> 00:20:42.552]  NASA PAC Technology.

[00:20:43.172 --> 00:20:47.334]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.

[00:20:48.754 --> 00:20:50.795]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:20:50.795 --> 00:20:52.756]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[00:24:22.493 --> 00:24:29.398]  Air filters, water filters, stuff to help your body deal with the toxins in our environment.
[00:24:29.398 --> 00:24:30.518]  Here's one for you.
[00:24:30.518 --> 00:24:33.040]  I don't think we talk about this product enough to be honest with you.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.301]  Z-Shield.
[00:24:34.301 --> 00:24:38.043]  Z-Shield Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support Formula.
[00:24:38.043 --> 00:24:40.445]  And it's 40% off right now.
[00:24:40.445 --> 00:24:41.446]  So this is a product that
[00:24:42.588 --> 00:24:47.451]  Well, we have so many new products now that when we come out with a new product, it almost just kind of vanishes.
[00:24:47.451 --> 00:24:49.272]  We don't even plug it enough.
[00:24:49.272 --> 00:24:51.434]  And to me, that's kind of what Z-Shield is.
[00:24:51.434 --> 00:24:54.296]  And it just reminded me how important this product is.
[00:24:54.296 --> 00:25:06.244]  When we started seeing the hurricanes come and we started talking to the experts about weather manipulation, chemtrails, cloud seeding, and then you realize that, wow, these are chemical
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:18.224]  Toxins that they're literally spraying in the air, heavy metals that they're literally spraying in the air, that are now causing us to live in an environment that is totally infiltrated by all this.
[00:25:18.224 --> 00:25:22.665]  So that's why we make Z-Shield, toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[00:25:22.665 --> 00:25:27.927]  The EPA admits that there's more than 800 million pounds of pesticide dumped in the U.S.
[00:25:27.927 --> 00:25:30.968]  every year, and 80% of them are used on crops.
[00:25:30.968 --> 00:25:34.129]  So what are you doing to fight that?
[00:25:34.997 --> 00:25:41.983]  Well, now we have a simple solution for you, and that's Z-Shield, and it's 40% off right now.
[00:25:41.983 --> 00:26:02.439]  So, when you see these stories about how they're just flooding our environment with all these chemicals, they're spraying heavy metals and toxins in the air, the solution is Z-Shield, especially right now, when, again today, I'm seeing reports in Austin, even today in Austin, they were spraying stuff in the air, all these lines in the sky,
[00:26:03.373 --> 00:26:17.377]  That's cloud seeding, that's chemtrails, this is geoengineering, and we try to fight back by providing you with a supplement that is meant to protect your body from these harmful elements, and it's 40% off.

[00:27:03.637 --> 00:27:05.578]  The ratings were down.
[00:27:05.578 --> 00:27:09.179]  We've got the media reacting to Trump tweeting out videos.
[00:27:09.179 --> 00:27:11.280]  Trump donating millions.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.941]  Trump is about to give a speech tomorrow at the UN.
[00:27:13.941 --> 00:27:15.422]  They're preparing for that.
[00:27:15.422 --> 00:27:18.904]  We've got another former Democrat donor.
[00:27:19.964 --> 00:27:36.732]  Added to the Russian probe lawyer list so we'll have more on that of course schools now trying to go full PC and Stopping using words like freshman upperclassmen and not naming schools Jefferson or Madison, but first Before we get to all that you had st.
[00:27:36.732 --> 00:27:44.296]  Louis rioting over the weekend and you know what I Forgot I was gonna time this right, but it but it's okay
[00:27:45.623 --> 00:27:47.305]  80 arrests as riot grips St.
[00:27:47.305 --> 00:27:51.312]  Louis for third day after ex-cop's acquittal and fatal shooting.
[00:27:51.312 --> 00:27:52.974]  Second night of violence in St.
[00:27:52.974 --> 00:27:54.757]  Louis after ex-cop acquitted.
[00:27:55.711 --> 00:28:00.332]  Protest turned violent in Del Mar Loop Saturday, second night of post-verdict strife.
[00:28:00.332 --> 00:28:02.093]  And that's in a different area.
[00:28:02.093 --> 00:28:05.614]  So you had people protesting and rioting downtown.
[00:28:05.614 --> 00:28:09.395]  Then you had people in the Del Mar Loop, an entire different area of St.
[00:28:09.395 --> 00:28:10.095]  Louis.
[00:28:10.095 --> 00:28:12.255]  Then you have people canceling concerts.
[00:28:12.255 --> 00:28:14.856]  U2, Ed Sheeran, cancel St.
[00:28:14.856 --> 00:28:15.856]  Louis concerts.
[00:28:15.856 --> 00:28:18.237]  Other events called off.
[00:28:18.237 --> 00:28:22.358]  Yeah, you had businesses boarding up, shops boarding up, shops closing down.
[00:28:23.632 --> 00:28:27.899]  So here is a video clip from local KMOV in St.
[00:28:27.899 --> 00:28:33.228]  Louis of Black Lives Matter protesters marching on Delmar, Delmar, excuse me, in St.
[00:28:33.228 --> 00:28:33.449]  Louis.
[00:28:50.976 --> 00:28:53.018]  This is in the Delmar Loop.
[00:28:53.018 --> 00:28:54.259]  This isn't even downtown.
[00:28:54.259 --> 00:28:57.242]  It's called the U-City Loop, a famous area of St.
[00:28:57.242 --> 00:28:58.523]  Louis.
[00:28:58.523 --> 00:29:02.767]  Right by Washington University where the presidential debate was.
[00:29:02.767 --> 00:29:04.728]  So as you can see here, hundreds of protesters.
[00:29:04.728 --> 00:29:08.431]  They were protesting all weekend.
[00:29:08.431 --> 00:29:12.475]  Let's go to another clip right after this.
[00:29:12.475 --> 00:29:16.038]  This is a protester getting harassed by Black Lives Matter.
[00:29:16.038 --> 00:29:16.739]  Go ahead and roll that.
[00:29:26.514 --> 00:29:28.837]  The reporter's not even allowed to be there to cover their protests.
[00:29:28.837 --> 00:29:30.579]  That doesn't make sense.
[00:29:30.579 --> 00:29:32.421]  Why protest if you don't want anyone to cover it?
[00:29:32.421 --> 00:29:34.844]  I've never understood that angle, but that's what's been going on.
[00:29:34.844 --> 00:29:35.705]  Wow.
[00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.092]  It's just, it's just so hateful.
[00:29:42.092 --> 00:29:44.554]  There's nothing, I mean, ah, wow.
[00:29:44.554 --> 00:29:45.395]  This is really sad.
[00:29:45.395 --> 00:29:46.656]  I'm sad to see this happen in St.
[00:29:46.656 --> 00:29:47.276]  Louis, folks.
[00:29:47.276 --> 00:29:47.777]  Don't go anywhere.
[00:29:47.777 --> 00:29:50.599]  We've got a special report with Alex Jones on the other side.
[00:29:59.082 --> 00:30:09.529]  It was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking such steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction to wit, by consolidation of power first and then corruption its necessary consequence.
[00:30:09.529 --> 00:30:16.914]  Jefferson was warning us about the global elite, the 1% of the 1%, consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government.
[00:30:16.914 --> 00:30:18.876]  Unfortunately, we didn't heed his advice.
[00:30:18.876 --> 00:30:24.940]  We now live in a neo-feudalistic society in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:32.649]  Political office no longer represents the voice of the people, but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy.
[00:30:32.649 --> 00:30:40.218]  Simply put, we the people are responsible for civilization and culture, yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world.
[00:30:40.458 --> 00:30:48.746]  We falsely believe that everything is simply black and white, one extreme against the other, conservative versus liberal, but things will change once more of us realize this truth.
[00:30:48.746 --> 00:30:56.153]  As Thomas Jefferson also said, enlighten the people generally and tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.
[00:30:56.153 --> 00:30:58.515]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com

[00:31:08.261 --> 00:31:16.665]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:31:16.665 --> 00:31:21.328]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:33:03.055 --> 00:33:04.376]  Big Brother.
[00:33:04.376 --> 00:33:06.137]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:06.137 --> 00:33:07.918]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:07.918 --> 00:33:09.478]  You want answers?
[00:33:09.478 --> 00:33:10.399]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:10.399 --> 00:33:15.222]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:15.222 --> 00:33:19.284]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.322]  Owen Schroer here for Alex Jones.
[00:33:23.322 --> 00:33:29.168]  We're going to hear from Alex Jones in this segment in five minutes on a breaking report on a CIA whistleblower.
[00:33:29.168 --> 00:33:33.032]  But first, you may wonder why you're seeing all these marches.
[00:33:33.032 --> 00:33:35.695]  Why are all these angry people marching for Black Lives Matter?
[00:33:35.695 --> 00:33:37.717]  Why are they screaming at white people in the streets?
[00:33:37.717 --> 00:33:38.958]  Why do the marches continue?
[00:33:39.684 --> 00:33:41.584]  Well, there's an answer for that.
[00:33:41.584 --> 00:33:47.406]  It's not just the funding that they get from George Soros groups, but it's mainstream media, folks.
[00:33:47.406 --> 00:34:01.489]  It's mainstream media virtue signaling, and quite frankly, just outright lying to these people, using propaganda to get them out into the streets, to trigger their emotions, and to make them believe things that aren't actually happening.
[00:34:02.699 --> 00:34:05.960]  So, we just played some videos of protesters in St.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:14.602]  Louis upset over the acquittal of an ex-cop for a murder of Lamar Smith, which, you look at the case, it doesn't look good.
[00:34:14.602 --> 00:34:15.722]  It doesn't look good.
[00:34:15.722 --> 00:34:23.704]  But you have to ask yourself the question, why are they marching over this case and Lamar Smith, why aren't they marching over Isaiah Hammett?
[00:34:23.704 --> 00:34:28.125]  You see, if you look at Isaiah Hammett's case, who was also killed by a SWAT team in St.
[00:34:28.125 --> 00:34:28.365]  Louis,
[00:34:29.105 --> 00:34:30.666]  It's not ambiguous.
[00:34:30.666 --> 00:34:36.410]  It's pretty obvious what happened, and when you look at the statements from the police, it looks even worse!
[00:34:36.410 --> 00:34:45.257]  But why don't they cover Isaiah Hammett's story, when a SWAT team literally raided the home unconstitutionally and shot the place up, murdering Isaiah Hammett?
[00:34:45.257 --> 00:34:49.380]  Literally going in with automatic weapons and shooting the house up.
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:53.243]  And then planting evidence, and then even their statements say, yeah, well, we don't really know.
[00:34:54.264 --> 00:34:55.205]  Wow.
[00:34:55.205 --> 00:34:56.826]  But no coverage of this.
[00:34:56.826 --> 00:34:58.007]  No marches.
[00:34:58.007 --> 00:34:59.908]  Nothing on CNN.
[00:34:59.908 --> 00:35:03.170]  But then, this ex-cop and Lamar Smith gets all the coverage.
[00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.591]  Why?
[00:35:03.591 --> 00:35:05.112]  Because Lamar Smith was black.
[00:35:05.993 --> 00:35:13.879]  And they know that they can use this propaganda to virtue signal and to get black people out in the streets angry and upset.
[00:35:13.879 --> 00:35:14.920]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.982]  So let's show some of these examples.
[00:35:17.982 --> 00:35:22.686]  First, let's start off with how they vaguely set the foundation.
[00:35:22.686 --> 00:35:26.569]  This is CNN commentator calling for the removal of Washington and Jefferson statues.
[00:35:28.324 --> 00:35:34.187]  You saw the interview I did with Corey Stewart, who's trying to run for Senate seat there in Virginia.
[00:35:34.187 --> 00:35:35.148]  A literal nitwit.
[00:35:35.148 --> 00:35:40.330]  He makes the case that it is about... I'm not trying to be mean, it's just this woman is a nitwit, philosophically and intellectually.
[00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:44.172]  ...that we have to get to the heart of the problem here... Oh, don't get me started on Angela Rye.
[00:35:44.172 --> 00:35:45.653]  Just cut my mic, I'll get too upset.
[00:35:46.169 --> 00:35:50.952]  Listen Angela Rye, if it wasn't for George Washington, freedom wouldn't even exist in this country!
[00:36:12.679 --> 00:36:23.375]  And she's gonna sit here and bitch about how history isn't taught right, and she doesn't even understand that if it wasn't for George Washington and the Founding Fathers, freedom as we know it wouldn't exist!
[00:36:25.063 --> 00:36:26.245]  Go ahead with Angela Rye!
[00:36:42.947 --> 00:36:43.468]  But I'm not.
[00:36:43.468 --> 00:36:44.208]  No, no, no.
[00:36:44.208 --> 00:36:44.769]  But I'm not.
[00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:45.390]  But I'm not.
[00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:46.451]  But I'm not, John.
[00:36:46.451 --> 00:36:48.273]  I'm going to finish my point.
[00:36:48.273 --> 00:36:49.474]  I'm going to finish my point.
[00:36:49.474 --> 00:36:51.156]  I'm not feeding into white supremacy.
[00:36:51.156 --> 00:36:55.200]  I'm calling out white supremacy for what it is and sometimes what it is, John.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.863]  As she's on a network owned by a white guy and has an opinion.
[00:36:57.863 --> 00:37:01.166]  Acknowledging that this country was built upon a very black man.
[00:37:01.787 --> 00:37:04.849]  What about your ancestors that sold your ancestors into slavery?
[00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:06.149]  Again, she doesn't even know history!
[00:37:06.149 --> 00:37:06.409]  What?!
[00:37:06.409 --> 00:37:06.770]  Then move!
[00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:08.711]  Why don't you move back to Africa then?
[00:37:08.711 --> 00:37:09.991]  If it's so bad here, go back to Africa.
[00:37:31.442 --> 00:37:32.422]  It's not gonna happen!
[00:37:32.422 --> 00:37:35.983]  There is no CNN there to give you a high-paying job, Angela Rye!
[00:37:35.983 --> 00:37:36.723]  Just sickening!
[00:37:36.723 --> 00:37:38.864]  That woman makes me sick!
[00:37:38.864 --> 00:37:41.544]  Here's another CNN commentator calling Trump a white supremacist.
[00:37:41.544 --> 00:37:43.985]  These people are just liars, man.
[00:37:43.985 --> 00:37:53.667]  Not only is Donald Trump a white supremacist sympathizer, I think he identifies with this notion of white supremacy, this notion of preservation of white culture.
[00:37:53.667 --> 00:37:55.847]  And does that make him a white supremacist?
[00:37:57.314 --> 00:38:00.937]  Yeah, does that essentially make him a racist?
[00:38:00.937 --> 00:38:09.182]  I absolutely believe so, and I've been hesitant to say that because I think words matter, words are really important, and I don't like to throw the word racist around.
[00:38:09.182 --> 00:38:17.328]  I don't like to throw lots of different kind of words like that around, and so today I'm at the point, much like the guess you just had, that the President of the United States is a racist.
[00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:22.371]  We have put a white supremacist in the White House.
[00:38:22.371 --> 00:38:24.873]  Great, yeah, so now you understand why
[00:38:26.246 --> 00:38:29.368]  Black people are so upset in this country.
[00:38:29.368 --> 00:38:31.389]  Because CNN is telling them to be.
[00:38:31.389 --> 00:38:33.550]  CNN is telling them this country is racist.
[00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:36.072]  CNN is telling them this country has kept them down.
[00:38:36.072 --> 00:38:40.474]  CNN is telling them that they have not been free in this country.
[00:38:40.474 --> 00:38:41.855]  All lies!
[00:38:41.855 --> 00:38:47.298]  And then we've got another clip of CNN cutting off a black Trump supporter because he rejects white guilt.
[00:38:47.298 --> 00:38:48.279]  But this is it, folks!
[00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:51.912]  You want to know why these protests happen?
[00:38:51.912 --> 00:38:53.413]  CNN selective coverage.
[00:38:53.413 --> 00:38:57.336]  You want to know why the propaganda gets out there and people buy it?
[00:38:57.336 --> 00:38:59.597]  CNN is feeding it to them.
[00:38:59.597 --> 00:39:08.624]  So look no further than Angela Rye and Simone Sanders and CNN when you see rioting, looting, and protesting in your streets.
[00:39:08.624 --> 00:39:14.689]  That's who's to blame because they go on air, lie about history, and lie about current day events.
[00:39:16.072 --> 00:39:17.933]  I'm sorry that I scream and yell about Angela Rye.
[00:39:17.933 --> 00:39:18.653]  She's just out of control.
[00:39:18.653 --> 00:39:19.954]  So, let's go now.
[00:39:19.954 --> 00:39:21.654]  This is a breaking report.
[00:39:21.654 --> 00:39:23.535]  This is from Alex Jones.
[00:39:23.535 --> 00:39:29.658]  A CIA whistleblower is going public on the Deep State coup to remove President Trump.
[00:39:29.658 --> 00:39:33.339]  Here's that report from Alex Jones.
[00:39:33.339 --> 00:39:41.643]  A shadowy government with its own Air Force, its own Navy, its own fundraising mechanism.
[00:39:42.892 --> 00:39:47.524]  And the ability to pursue his own ideas of the national interest.
[00:39:47.524 --> 00:39:49.549]  Free from all checks and balances.
[00:39:56.789 --> 00:40:10.155]  During the 1970s, Senator Frank Church held the Church Committee hearings, where decades of secret, clandestine, deep state operations were made public to the world.
[00:40:10.155 --> 00:40:21.001]  From mind control of small kidnapped children in America, to government narcotics trafficking, to the structure of the deep, permanent, secret government itself,
[00:40:21.821 --> 00:40:24.183]  A lot of incredible revelations came out.
[00:40:24.183 --> 00:40:27.246]  Then, during the Iran-Contra hearings of the 1980s, even more came out.
[00:40:30.091 --> 00:40:37.655]  As a young researcher, I began to look into this information in the early 1990s and became somewhat of a history buff on it.
[00:40:37.655 --> 00:40:54.164]  That's why it's been very frustrating for me, who is informed from the congressional record, to cover this information and have controlled corporate media, in many cases working directly for the deep state, lie to the public and tell you that I'm fake news.
[00:40:54.904 --> 00:41:09.397]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we now have a high-level CIA whistleblower who's gone public and given a lengthy speech detailing the very structure of the shadow government which controls the ever-expanding Deep State.
[00:41:10.017 --> 00:41:18.663]  Kevin Schipp worked for more than two decades at the highest level of the Central Intelligence Agency in some of the most secretive projects.
[00:41:18.663 --> 00:41:39.279]  In the last decade, he's been quietly working with the former technical director of the National Security Agency, William Binney, to bring out legally what they can without violating the so-called national security laws that the deep state uses via the shadow government and the controlled corporate press to keep the American people in the dark.
[00:41:41.018 --> 00:41:48.360]  Kevin Schipp recently spoke live to a crowd at a geoengineering conference of Scientist and Press.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:55.162]  Zero Hedge transcribed much of the video that's posted on InfoWars.com as well as ZeroHedge.com.
[00:41:55.162 --> 00:42:00.524]  But in the interest of brevity, let me simply read from the transcript from Zero Hedge.
[00:42:00.524 --> 00:42:08.906]  Then I'm going to give you the rest of the story coming up here in a few minutes about what the goals of the shadow government actually are.
[00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:15.974]  From the article, high-ranking CIA agent blows whistle on Deep State, shadow government.
[00:42:15.974 --> 00:42:20.076]  NSA and CIA at the top of the shadow government apparatus.
[00:42:20.076 --> 00:42:22.558]  Zero Hedge, September 16, 2017.
[00:42:22.558 --> 00:42:27.621]  And here we are covering it now, live on the 18th.
[00:42:27.621 --> 00:42:39.088]  A CIA whistleblower, Kevin Shipp, has emerged from the wolves' den to expose the Deep State and the shadow government, which he calls two entirely separate entities.
[00:42:40.049 --> 00:42:50.800]  And again, the reason this is so important is he says there's a civil war in the deep state trying to alert the public to how the shadow government controls the deep state.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.641]  The deep state's not the enemy.
[00:42:52.641 --> 00:42:59.968]  It was established after nuclear weapons were developed so that in case the main government got wiped out, there was a backup.
[00:42:59.968 --> 00:43:04.453]  But special interests have used the transference of power to the deep state
[00:43:05.623 --> 00:43:12.625]  To again set up a parallel government that's operating outside the American people's control and which operates directly against the American people.
[00:43:12.625 --> 00:43:13.945]  Let me go back to the article.
[00:43:13.945 --> 00:43:16.766]  From high-level CIA whistleblower, Shipp's speech.
[00:43:27.128 --> 00:43:35.687]  Ship had a series of slides explaining how the deep state and shadow government functions as well as the horrific crimes they are committing against U.S.
[00:43:35.687 --> 00:43:36.088]  citizens.
[00:43:37.088 --> 00:43:49.958]  Some of the revelations the former CIA anti-terrorism counterintelligence officer revealed included that Google Earth was set up through the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and In-Q-Tel.
[00:43:49.958 --> 00:43:51.339]  Indeed, he is correct.
[00:43:51.339 --> 00:44:01.608]  The CIA and NGA owned the company Google acquired Keyhole, Inc., paying an undisclosed sum for the company to turn its tech into what we now know as Google Earth.
[00:44:02.148 --> 00:44:05.011]  Another curious investor in Keyhole Inc.
[00:44:05.011 --> 00:44:12.058]  was none other than venture capital firm Inhutel, run by the CIA, according to a press release at the time.
[00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:19.893]  But of course it was In-Q-Tel money that helped found Google in the beginning as well.
[00:44:19.893 --> 00:44:28.860]  This is the controlled deployment of secret government technologies to the public with backdoor Trojan horses for global control.
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:34.045]  SHIP also disclosed that the agency known as the Joint Special Ops Command
[00:44:34.805 --> 00:44:44.371]  Is the president's secret army, which he can use for secret assassinations, overturning governments, and things the American people don't know about.
[00:44:44.371 --> 00:44:51.876]  And that really first started with Delta Force in 1979, but now has expanded out into an entire sprawling complex.
[00:44:51.876 --> 00:44:54.558]  And it's not just the army, but other branches of the military.
[00:44:55.438 --> 00:45:05.905]  FBI warrantless searches violate the Fourth Amendment with the National Security Letters, which SHIP noted enables them to walk into your employer's office and demand all your financial records.
[00:45:05.905 --> 00:45:16.812]  And if he or she says anything about them being there, they can put your supervisor in jail or drop a case against themselves using the state's secret privilege law.
[00:45:17.532 --> 00:45:19.773]  Now here's where it gets really important.
[00:45:19.773 --> 00:45:26.175]  The top of the shadow government is the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency, Schipp said.
[00:45:26.175 --> 00:45:32.377]  Schipp expressed that the CIA was created through the Council on Foreign Relations with no congressional approval.
[00:45:32.377 --> 00:45:36.658]  And historically, the CFR is also tied into the mainstream media.
[00:45:36.658 --> 00:45:46.681]  He elaborated that the CIA was the quote, central node of the shadow government and controlled all of the other 16 intelligence agencies, despite the existence of the DNI.
[00:45:47.603 --> 00:46:01.056]  The agency also controls defense and intelligence contractors that manipulate the president and political decisions, has the power to start wars, torture, initiate coups, and commit false flag attacks, he said.
[00:46:01.056 --> 00:46:08.923]  As Schipp stated, the CIA was created through executive order by then President Harry Truman by signing the National Security Act of 1947.
[00:46:11.374 --> 00:46:19.599]  Then the shadow government began to absorb the legitimate government and parlay American power into global domination.
[00:46:19.599 --> 00:46:22.081]  My words, not SHIP's.
[00:46:22.081 --> 00:46:38.170]  Continuing with SHIP, the deep state is comprised of the military-industrial complex, intelligence contractors, defense contractors, MIC lobbyists, Wall Street offshore accounts, Federal Reserve, IMF World Bank Treasury, foreign lobbyists, and central banks.
[00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:39.751]  But what is their ideology?
[00:46:39.751 --> 00:46:40.452]  I'm going to get to that.
[00:46:41.243 --> 00:46:43.184]  The rest of the story.
[00:46:43.184 --> 00:46:52.470]  In the shocking, explosive presentation, Schipp went on to express that there are over 10,000 secret sites in the United States that formed after 9-11.
[00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:59.034]  There are 1,291 secret government agencies, 1,931 large private corporations, and over 4,800,000 Americans that he knows of who have a security clearance, and over 854,000 who have top secret clearance, explaining
[00:47:09.801 --> 00:47:13.404]  Why they signed their lives away bound by an agreement.
[00:47:13.404 --> 00:47:27.957]  He also detailed how Congress is owned by the Military Industrial Complex of the Congressional Armed Services Committee, 48 senior members of Congress, giving those members money in return for a vote on the spending bill for the military and intelligence budget.
[00:47:29.622 --> 00:47:41.910]  He even touched on what he called the, quote, secret intelligence industrial complex, which he called the center of the shadow government, including CIA, NSA, NRO, and NGA.
[00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:50.235]  Schipp further stated that around the secret intelligence industrial complex, you have the big five conglomerate of intelligence contractors.
[00:47:50.235 --> 00:47:51.216]  Leidos Holdings.
[00:47:52.503 --> 00:47:58.366]  CSRA, CACI, SAIC, and Booz Allen Hamilton.
[00:47:58.366 --> 00:48:02.048]  He noted that the work they do is top secret and unreported.
[00:48:02.048 --> 00:48:16.314]  The whistleblower remarked that these intelligence contractors are accountable to no one, including Congress, echoing the words of Senator Daniel Inouye when he himself blew the whistle on the shadow government during the Iran-Contra hearings in 1987.
[00:48:16.314 --> 00:48:17.515]  Let's go to a clip from that.
[00:48:17.515 --> 00:48:21.657]  A shadowy government with its own Air Force,
[00:48:23.121 --> 00:48:37.891]  His own Navy, his own fundraising mechanism, and the ability to pursue his own ideas of the national interest, free from all checks and balances, and free from the law itself.
[00:48:38.524 --> 00:48:39.545]  So who is Schiff?
[00:48:39.545 --> 00:48:40.806]  Is he credible?
[00:48:40.806 --> 00:48:42.268]  Is he who he says he is?
[00:48:42.268 --> 00:48:45.951]  And the answer is, as we're about to cover, absolutely, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:45.951 --> 00:48:50.215]  He is one of the highest level CIA whistleblowers we've ever seen.
[00:48:50.215 --> 00:48:57.462]  And he gives us, again, another window into even how the people high level in the system are being abused, used, and controlled.
[00:48:58.712 --> 00:49:01.394]  This is what AIM.org wrote about Schipp.
[00:49:01.394 --> 00:49:04.056]  Schipp held several high-level positions in the CIA.
[00:49:04.056 --> 00:49:25.231]  He was assigned as a protective agent for the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, a counterintelligence investigator, a counterterrorism center staff, a team leader protecting sensitive CIA assets from assassination, a manager of high-ranking protective operations, a lead instructor for members of the Allied governments, an internal staff security investigator, and a polygraph examiner.
[00:49:25.951 --> 00:49:33.358]  He was tasked with protecting the CIA from foreign agent penetration and the chief of training for the CIA Federal Police Force.
[00:49:33.358 --> 00:49:40.885]  Mr. Shipp functioned as a program manager for the Department of State Diplomatic Security and Anti-Terrorism Assistance Global Policing Training Program.
[00:49:41.405 --> 00:49:48.989]  He is the recipient of two CIA meritorious unit citations, three exceptional performance awards, and a medallion of overseas covert operations.
[00:49:48.989 --> 00:49:54.952]  He is the author of From the Company of Shadows, CIA Operations and the War on Terrorism.
[00:49:54.952 --> 00:50:02.035]  Is this the beginning of more whistleblowers coming forward to end the shadow government and deep state?
[00:50:02.035 --> 00:50:07.698]  You can watch Schipp's full explosive presentation below at ZeroHedge.com or NewsWars.com.
[00:50:09.648 --> 00:50:15.017]  And now, as Paul Harvey would say, let me, in brevity, give you the rest of the story.
[00:50:15.017 --> 00:50:21.047]  And remember, everything I'm going to break down, everything I'm going to talk about, is actually hiding in plain view.
[00:50:22.452 --> 00:50:39.746]  The shadow state would love you to believe that everything they're doing is invincible and all-powerful, when really it's a bunch of different special interests that have established a new form of royalty for themselves so they can operate above the law, in many cases for their own interest.
[00:50:40.447 --> 00:50:45.790]  And what they're really trying to do is take control of human development and control the future.
[00:50:45.790 --> 00:51:07.262]  And use America's incredible ingenuity, inventiveness, and strength and will to project that power out into the world to establish the first corporate planetary government whose ends is to carry out a worldwide eugenics program against the population.
[00:51:08.268 --> 00:51:09.954]  But I want to be clear.
[00:51:09.954 --> 00:51:11.278]  The so-called Deep State...
[00:51:12.256 --> 00:51:14.036]  It's made up of our military.
[00:51:14.036 --> 00:51:21.018]  It's made up of anybody that's signed any type of confidentiality forms that works for major corporations that do government work.
[00:51:21.018 --> 00:51:30.780]  A large part of our country is involved in this so-called shadow system, which was established, again, to defeat the Soviet Union and to survive a nuclear war.
[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:36.501]  So many of the people involved in the shadow government are not bad people.
[00:51:36.501 --> 00:51:39.282]  Many people involved in the deep state are not bad people.
[00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:56.263]  But it's critical to understand that the people that have burrowed in and gotten control of the shadow government are in control of the deep state and thus our taxes, our regulations,
[00:51:57.208 --> 00:51:59.289]  Our nation, our direction.
[00:51:59.289 --> 00:52:04.871]  And so if you ask, why is the media lockstep anti-family, anti-Christian, pro-Islamic?
[00:52:04.871 --> 00:52:06.411]  Why is the media for open borders?
[00:52:06.411 --> 00:52:07.952]  Why is the media for globalism?
[00:52:07.952 --> 00:52:10.453]  Why is the media attacking marriage?
[00:52:10.453 --> 00:52:12.753]  Why is the media attacking men and women?
[00:52:12.753 --> 00:52:14.754]  Why is the media promoting race war?
[00:52:14.754 --> 00:52:18.155]  Why is the media promoting Hollywood garbage?
[00:52:18.155 --> 00:52:23.177]  And it's because the people that craved power and the people that got control
[00:52:24.372 --> 00:52:24.412]  of
[00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:47.412]  The ultimate form of control is abusing and hurting or even killing small children.
[00:52:47.412 --> 00:53:01.321]  And that's why from the deep state that controls the Vatican to the deep state that controls our major intelligence agencies to Congress, you see perpetual occultism, pedophilia, and bizarre behavior.
[00:53:01.321 --> 00:53:02.983]  Because as we read in history books,
[00:53:03.743 --> 00:53:06.806]  Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts, absolutely.
[00:53:06.806 --> 00:53:19.699]  And these elites have been out of control forever, believing they're above the law, doing things so evil and corrupt, that like psychopaths, who don't get caught, tend to get more and more reckless.
[00:53:19.699 --> 00:53:23.722]  They've gotten more and more reckless, and are now basically trying to get caught.
[00:53:23.722 --> 00:53:26.125]  They're begging all of us to stop them.
[00:53:27.932 --> 00:53:30.333]  Control freaks want to run your life.
[00:53:30.333 --> 00:53:33.194]  And to do that, they've got to build an artificial environment.
[00:53:33.194 --> 00:53:39.517]  They've got to take your resources and build their breakaway civilization so they can play God.
[00:53:39.517 --> 00:53:43.978]  But they don't want you to have access to the life extension technologies.
[00:53:43.978 --> 00:53:47.080]  They don't want you to have access to the quantum computing.
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.300]  They don't want you to have access to the AI.
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:53.002]  Because if you had access to that, you would be a competitor to them.
[00:53:54.380 --> 00:54:09.085]  So the deep state's greatest crime is that they've deployed technology to the American people and to people of other nations, but only with back doors in it that surveil us and control us and let them know our hopes and dreams so they can manipulate us.
[00:54:10.492 --> 00:54:19.458]  The Deep State has a goal to dehumanize and reduce world population from between 80 and 90 percent.
[00:54:19.458 --> 00:54:21.519]  Their documents are public.
[00:54:21.519 --> 00:54:32.727]  And they are carrying out covert operations where they are adding sterilants and where they are adding cancer viruses and other slow kill and soft kill weapons to the vaccines.
[00:54:32.727 --> 00:54:36.369]  Fluoride added in 1947 was a National Security Act.
[00:54:36.369 --> 00:54:40.292]  The Nazis and the Communist Russians had done it to lower fertility and lower IQ.
[00:54:42.132 --> 00:54:46.474]  Keeping iodine out of the food supply, also about reducing population.
[00:54:46.474 --> 00:54:52.735]  And their argument is, if you're dumb enough to not know you need this, you deserve what's happening to you.
[00:54:52.735 --> 00:54:55.596]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've stolen the future.
[00:54:55.596 --> 00:55:00.177]  Special interests have gone in, set up a secret government, and they've broken away.
[00:55:00.177 --> 00:55:05.239]  And the hope here is that there are good people inside the deep state.
[00:55:06.243 --> 00:55:24.726]  Not many inside the shadow government who know that this is evil, and now they've gotten further enough down the line to know that enough pieces of the puzzle have been put together, because they're compartmentalized as well, to understand the endgame is global government and global exterminism and an anti-God, anti-family hell.
[00:55:24.726 --> 00:55:29.767]  So because they understand the endgame is corrupt, they're fighting back.
[00:55:29.767 --> 00:55:31.668]  They're leaking information.
[00:55:31.668 --> 00:55:32.568]  They're speaking out.
[00:55:33.428 --> 00:55:45.036]  And they supported Donald Trump because it was believed he wanted Americana, he wanted prosperity, he wanted God, guts, and guns again, not the socialist hell that the globalists are trying to push.
[00:55:45.036 --> 00:55:48.078]  And to a great extent, Trump has delivered so far.
[00:55:48.078 --> 00:55:53.682]  But he's being pulled in and surrounded by the swamp that covets power more than anything else.
[00:55:53.682 --> 00:56:02.968]  That's why it's important for us to devolve power from the globalist systems, from the big box stores, from the New World Order operations, to our own towns.
[00:56:03.908 --> 00:56:31.547]  Our own cities, our own schools, our own businesses, and to rediscover what Americana is, and to say no to the globalists that would steal the future, and to understand they've used the secrecy to establish a system that if they used it to empower humanity would take us to the stars, but instead is trying to kill the West and kill the very renaissance that was so powerful it gave birth to the technologies
[00:56:32.307 --> 00:56:39.670]  That have allowed many of these globalists to basically have the control and foresight and knowledge of demigods.
[00:56:40.782 --> 00:56:47.064]  Ladies and gentlemen, now more than ever, it's critical for you to make a decision about the facts we presented here.
[00:56:47.064 --> 00:56:56.766]  And to understand the reason I've been demonized and attacked and made fun of everywhere is because they think you're weak minded and they don't want you to pay attention to what I've been saying for 22 years.
[00:56:56.766 --> 00:57:06.029]  The truth is, we've been dead on because we're going to the source white paper documents where the globalists have arrogantly been communicating in public about this plan.
[00:57:07.009 --> 00:57:09.631]  The truth is I'm dead on.
[00:57:09.631 --> 00:57:22.339]  And the truth is I'm still alive because of you supporting me and many people in the deep state that are patriots that understand the truth so the evil globalists are afraid to kill me because it might turn me into a martyr or they might get caught.
[00:57:23.507 --> 00:57:29.433]  We're in the middle of a civil war, deciding the future destiny of this republic and the world.
[00:57:29.433 --> 00:57:42.006]  And people making jokes about this, or people not paying attention, or folks deciding they don't matter, so just let somebody else handle it, is what has put us in the position of almost being technotronic, technocracy slaves.
[00:57:43.087 --> 00:57:46.891]  Let's continue with what our ancestors did and stand up for what's right.
[00:57:46.891 --> 00:57:49.594]  Let's focus on being engaged and informed.
[00:57:49.594 --> 00:57:51.416]  And let's turn this world around.
[00:57:51.416 --> 00:57:57.523]  Because as Thomas Jefferson said, the only thing an evil man in tyranny to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[00:57:57.523 --> 00:57:59.525]  And the truth is the tide is turning.
[00:57:59.525 --> 00:58:00.626]  History's happening.
[00:58:00.626 --> 00:58:02.589]  And it's because of you, the info warriors.
[00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:05.911]  That this planet has a shot of being free.
[00:58:05.911 --> 00:58:06.932]  That's not hype.
[00:58:06.932 --> 00:58:07.773]  It's the truth.
[00:58:07.773 --> 00:58:11.476]  The globalists know you're the most awake, informed people out there.
[00:58:11.476 --> 00:58:13.197]  They know you're the tip of the spear.
[00:58:13.197 --> 00:58:19.102]  So now, more than ever, double down your efforts to reach out to everyone you know to inform them about the facts.
[00:58:19.102 --> 00:58:22.124]  And share this video with everybody you know.
[00:58:22.124 --> 00:58:25.867]  Second Hour is coming up live with Owen Schroyer and more straight ahead.
[00:58:25.867 --> 00:58:28.309]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the InfoWar.
[00:58:38.070 --> 00:58:41.751]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:41.751 --> 00:58:48.532]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:48.532 --> 00:58:54.014]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:58:54.014 --> 00:58:56.094]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:58:56.094 --> 00:59:01.375]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:59:01.375 --> 00:59:05.116]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants that
[00:59:05.256 --> 00:59:08.678]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:11.860]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:15.742]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:59:15.742 --> 00:59:22.906]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:59:22.906 --> 00:59:29.030]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine,
[00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:30.890]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:01.818 --> 01:00:11.123]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:11.123 --> 01:00:11.243]  Well...
[01:00:15.896 --> 01:00:24.924]  I'm waiting for Angela Rye and Simone Sanders of CNN ISIS News to report on Chicago homicides.
[01:00:24.924 --> 01:00:34.293]  There have been over 500 homicides in 2017, and those were stats back from April, so who knows what that number is now, but it's really sad to me.
[01:00:36.795 --> 01:00:37.375]  Sure.
[01:00:37.375 --> 01:00:40.857]  Is it harder for some black people in this country?
[01:00:40.857 --> 01:00:41.338]  Absolutely.
[01:00:41.338 --> 01:00:42.518]  No one's trying to argue that.
[01:00:42.518 --> 01:00:44.119]  We're trying to argue the reasons.
[01:00:44.119 --> 01:00:53.484]  We're trying to get down to the bottom of it and we're trying to point out that the people virtue signaling over this are trying to incite civil war and race bait you.
[01:00:53.484 --> 01:00:59.808]  They never talk about the CIA plan to end the family, which has hit the black home more than anything.
[01:00:59.808 --> 01:01:01.528]  They never talked about the MTV
[01:01:02.987 --> 01:01:08.933]  Propaganda used to destroy black culture and make it all about being a gangster.
[01:01:08.933 --> 01:01:10.735]  And then now that's what you have.
[01:01:10.735 --> 01:01:12.697]  And that's what you see out on the streets.
[01:01:12.697 --> 01:01:14.078]  But nobody talks about that.
[01:01:14.078 --> 01:01:24.789]  It's all about white supremacy, even though it was George Washington and Thomas Jefferson that laid the foundations of independence and freedom, not just for us here in the West, but worldwide.
[01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:26.591]  That's why it's called the Shot Heard Round the World.
[01:01:27.452 --> 01:01:29.413]  But they don't do their history research.
[01:01:29.413 --> 01:01:31.074]  They don't tell you anything about that.
[01:01:31.074 --> 01:01:37.296]  So we'll all be waiting for Angela Rye and Simone Sanders to report on the black-on-black murders going on in Chicago.
[01:01:37.296 --> 01:01:41.678]  But they won't do that because they can't virtue signal and they can't race-base over that.
[01:01:41.678 --> 01:01:56.465]  So it's just really ironic that the people here, Simone Sanders, Angela Rye, the list goes on and on, that are telling you that you're a victim, telling black people you're a victim, putting them in that victim state, which then cripples them for life.
[01:01:57.406 --> 01:02:10.450]  So Angela Rye and Simone Sanders cripple black people for life, telling them they're a victim, and then they're the actual progenitors of the oppression of black people that they claim to be calling out and helping.
[01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:11.851]  So how do you like that?
[01:02:11.851 --> 01:02:23.075]  Angela Rye and Simone Sanders are oppressing black people by making them victims and becoming progenitors of the CIA agenda to end the family and to make black people reliant on welfare.
[01:02:23.875 --> 01:02:30.401]  So there's the truth that Angela Rye and Simone Sanders of ISIS, or excuse me, CNN, won't tell you.
[01:02:30.401 --> 01:02:36.808]  Now here's a clip of CNN cutting off a black Trump supporter as he completely destroys their concept of white guilt.
[01:02:37.662 --> 01:02:40.943]  Exactly how he operates and why he does what he does.
[01:02:40.943 --> 01:02:42.603]  He's playing 3D chess.
[01:02:42.603 --> 01:02:45.604]  You know, I've seen some shirts here today though.
[01:02:45.604 --> 01:02:47.324]  CNN, the Checkers News Network.
[01:02:47.324 --> 01:02:48.645]  Bill Gill, things like that.
[01:02:48.645 --> 01:02:54.226]  There have been some messages that might not be that open to folks from diverse perspectives.
[01:02:54.226 --> 01:02:55.967]  We've been reporting that Trump is racist.
[01:02:55.967 --> 01:02:56.767]  How are you liking him?
[01:02:58.555 --> 01:02:59.355]  I agree with that.
[01:02:59.355 --> 01:03:10.744]  I actually just made a post about it on my page and a video about it is that there are some white Americans that feel guilty for what their ancestors did, this and that.
[01:03:10.744 --> 01:03:13.526]  And the thing about it is, they shouldn't have to feel guilty.
[01:03:13.526 --> 01:03:14.207]  This is America.
[01:03:17.742 --> 01:03:21.385]  And just let me correct myself, Boris, that was actually Deontay Johnson.
[01:03:21.385 --> 01:03:25.748]  He's the founder of the Conservative Black Foundation.
[01:03:25.748 --> 01:03:29.710]  He was one of the many African-American speakers that spoke today at this rally.
[01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:32.132]  An effort by this group to challenge- How is this possible?
[01:03:32.132 --> 01:03:33.673]  CNN told them Trump is racist.
[01:03:33.673 --> 01:03:34.333]  I can't believe it.
[01:03:34.333 --> 01:03:40.797]  There's no doubt the majority of people that were here were certainly white, but we did see a cross-section of Americans.
[01:03:40.797 --> 01:03:44.760]  And the goal here was to get out of this situation peacefully, and they were able-
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.202]  Alright, now let's go again to a video of St.
[01:03:47.202 --> 01:03:51.065]  Louis protesters in the street chanting, stop killing us.
[01:03:51.065 --> 01:03:54.427]  This is part of the protest in St.
[01:03:54.427 --> 01:03:54.667]  Louis.
[01:03:54.667 --> 01:03:56.669]  This is outside the police headquarters.
[01:03:56.669 --> 01:03:57.590]  I believe that's in Clayton.
[01:04:00.979 --> 01:04:02.060]  The audio not so good on this.
[01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:07.242]  If you're a TV viewer at InfoWars.com slash show, you can see it.
[01:04:07.242 --> 01:04:08.262]  Of course, I'm from St.
[01:04:08.262 --> 01:04:08.562]  Louis.
[01:04:08.562 --> 01:04:10.743]  I've had friends that have been updating me on this situation.
[01:04:10.743 --> 01:04:12.064]  It's very sad.
[01:04:12.064 --> 01:04:18.486]  These are actually liberal friends, Democrat voters of mine, that say this is tearing the country apart and they can't believe this is happening.
[01:04:18.486 --> 01:04:19.427]  So, but here's what you have.
[01:04:21.010 --> 01:04:27.497]  So, the CNN reporters go out, they tell black people they're victims, but they don't really tell you what's going on.
[01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:40.732]  They virtue signal these people and make them victims, oppressing them more, and then send them out into the streets, where then they're confronted by the police, because they're acting violently, chanting to kill police, and then CNN takes that, and again uses that to victimize black people.
[01:04:41.172 --> 01:04:45.621]  This is the propaganda circle that we're seeing from fake news.
[01:04:45.621 --> 01:04:46.743]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:04:46.743 --> 01:04:51.773]  More of the Alex Jones Show, including the complete collapse of the failed Emmys last night.
[01:04:51.773 --> 01:04:52.274]  I didn't watch them.
[01:04:52.274 --> 01:04:52.795]  I don't know what happened.
[01:04:55.302 --> 01:05:06.246]  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:05:06.246 --> 01:05:13.309]  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:22.433]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government.
[01:05:24.091 --> 01:05:25.892]  Independence isn't a day.
[01:05:25.892 --> 01:05:26.933]  It's a mindset.
[01:05:26.933 --> 01:05:29.694]  An attitude that says, I will not be your dependent.
[01:05:29.694 --> 01:05:31.295]  I will not be your slave.
[01:05:31.295 --> 01:05:37.379]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[01:05:37.379 --> 01:05:42.341]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave.
[01:05:42.341 --> 01:05:44.223]  Slaves are never safe.
[01:05:44.223 --> 01:05:47.224]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[01:05:47.224 --> 01:05:48.305]  Guard your liberty.
[01:05:48.305 --> 01:05:51.627]  Regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[01:05:51.627 --> 01:05:53.568]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:05:55.202 --> 01:06:05.784]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:06:05.784 --> 01:06:07.844]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:06:07.844 --> 01:06:10.705]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:06:10.705 --> 01:06:12.205]  It's made in the USA.
[01:06:12.205 --> 01:06:19.027]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:06:19.027 --> 01:06:20.267]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[01:06:21.107 --> 01:06:30.811]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:06:30.811 --> 01:06:47.618]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:06:47.618 --> 01:06:50.779]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:06:50.919 --> 01:06:55.082]  Now it's time to change our bodies with a Z-Shield at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:55.082 --> 01:07:03.828]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[01:07:03.828 --> 01:07:04.369]  That's right.
[01:07:04.369 --> 01:07:09.632]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.
[01:07:09.632 --> 01:07:16.057]  Go to Infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use,
[01:07:16.297 --> 01:07:23.879]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[01:07:23.879 --> 01:07:24.139]  Woo!
[01:07:24.139 --> 01:07:25.159]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:07:25.159 --> 01:07:33.902]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:07:33.902 --> 01:07:41.944]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:07:43.484 --> 01:07:46.927]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:07:46.927 --> 01:07:51.031]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:07:51.031 --> 01:07:52.112]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:07:52.112 --> 01:07:54.694]  Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[01:08:10.541 --> 01:08:12.662]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:12.662 --> 01:08:15.323]  Because there is a war on.
[01:08:15.323 --> 01:08:19.305]  Are you in mind?
[01:08:19.305 --> 01:08:28.268]  Well, President Trump just met with Netanyahu, and Netanyahu says that U.S.-Israeli relations are stronger than ever.
[01:08:28.268 --> 01:08:29.989]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:29.989 --> 01:08:31.570]  Owen Troyer filling in today.
[01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:39.313]  We've covered how CNN-slash-ISIS is race-baiting and causing racial tension in this country.
[01:08:40.708 --> 01:08:43.109]  We're about to get into the Emmys that were a complete failure.
[01:08:43.109 --> 01:08:45.210]  Yeah, the Emmys happened last night.
[01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:49.272]  I know, America didn't care and didn't notice.
[01:08:49.272 --> 01:08:55.756]  And so they had to do something to grab the attention, so they cried about Trump for the entire production.
[01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:56.416]  That's what they do.
[01:08:56.416 --> 01:08:58.657]  I mean, they gotta get attention somehow.
[01:08:58.657 --> 01:09:00.858]  Nobody cares about these people anymore.
[01:09:00.858 --> 01:09:06.521]  Emmys devolves into three-hour celebrity anti-Trump rage fest.
[01:09:06.521 --> 01:09:08.042]  You know, I wanna take your calls on this later.
[01:09:09.073 --> 01:09:11.294]  We're about to hear from some nitwit celebrities.
[01:09:11.294 --> 01:09:13.996]  We've already heard from nitwit CNN pundits.
[01:09:13.996 --> 01:09:17.298]  So I want to take your calls on this later.
[01:09:17.298 --> 01:09:22.181]  Are these people that dumb and ignorant or are they that blackmailed?
[01:09:22.181 --> 01:09:22.721]  I'm serious.
[01:09:22.721 --> 01:09:23.542]  What do people think?
[01:09:24.451 --> 01:09:34.920]  Are these actors that blackmailed or that desperate to get the next role that they'll say whatever they're told to say or they'll say whatever will get them an award or the next role in a movie?
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:42.446]  Are these CNN pundits like Simone Sanders and Angela Rye that dumb, that ignorant, or do they genuinely want to see race baiting?
[01:09:42.446 --> 01:09:44.327]  Do they genuinely want to see civil war?
[01:09:44.327 --> 01:09:49.151]  I mean, they're telling these people, you're justified to go out and loot.
[01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:51.253]  You're justified to go out and riot.
[01:09:52.776 --> 01:09:53.976]  Okay.
[01:09:53.976 --> 01:10:01.139]  John Oliver apparently wins an award for variety, even though he has the stalest show ever.
[01:10:01.139 --> 01:10:02.439]  It's the same thing every night.
[01:10:02.439 --> 01:10:04.000]  The same thing everyone else is doing.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:04.860]  Bash Trump.
[01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:06.641]  How does he win an award for variety?
[01:10:06.641 --> 01:10:09.442]  Oh, because that's how the Emmys work.
[01:10:09.442 --> 01:10:11.763]  You don't win an award for being original.
[01:10:11.763 --> 01:10:13.683]  You don't win an award for being creative.
[01:10:13.683 --> 01:10:16.664]  You don't win an award for dominating other programs.
[01:10:16.664 --> 01:10:18.465]  You win an award for bashing Trump.
[01:10:19.656 --> 01:10:23.757]  John Oliver bashed Trump the hardest, so he gets the award.
[01:10:23.757 --> 01:10:31.400]  That's how it works!
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.660]  That's right!
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:39.902]  Stephen Colbert, we want you to use your nightly show to bash President Trump.
[01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:43.743]  If you do that, we'll give you the role of hosting the Emmys.
[01:10:43.743 --> 01:10:45.124]  Colbert gladly goes along.
[01:10:49.753 --> 01:10:53.556]  Just goes on and on here.
[01:10:53.556 --> 01:10:57.698]  Yeah, people care less and less about them.
[01:10:57.698 --> 01:11:03.522]  So that's why they're more desperate to try to be the center of attention.
[01:11:03.522 --> 01:11:09.406]  And then in this story from News 1, they say black people can't be racist.
[01:11:09.406 --> 01:11:12.328]  So that's actually, I guess, kind of racist in and of itself.
[01:11:12.328 --> 01:11:14.369]  So let's go to this video clip.
[01:11:14.369 --> 01:11:15.210]  This is a compilation.
[01:11:19.993 --> 01:11:22.734]  Of the opening monologue bashing Trump.
[01:11:22.734 --> 01:11:30.135]  This is supposed to be about celebrating greatness in television, greatness in acting, greatness in putting on these shows.
[01:11:30.135 --> 01:11:36.476]  No, instead it's trying to bash American greatness, bash a president that actually cares about this country.
[01:11:36.476 --> 01:11:41.517]  This is the complete devolution of mainstream media.
[01:11:41.517 --> 01:11:43.398]  Here's a compilation of the Emmys.
[01:11:50.456 --> 01:11:53.299]  This isn't even entertaining.
[01:11:53.299 --> 01:11:54.680]  I'm already bored.
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:55.180]  I won't.
[01:12:17.383 --> 01:12:19.385]  I love television.
[01:12:19.385 --> 01:12:21.146]  It's a pleasant distraction.
[01:12:21.146 --> 01:12:22.907]  But just imagine taking action.
[01:12:22.907 --> 01:12:24.809]  I like Brooklyn Nine-Nine.
[01:12:24.809 --> 01:12:26.410]  In fact, I'm addicted.
[01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:29.232]  But where's the cop show when one gets convicted?
[01:12:29.232 --> 01:12:29.872]  I miss the classic
[01:12:30.132 --> 01:12:39.301]  So again, Chance the Rapper says, why aren't these cops getting convicted?
[01:12:39.301 --> 01:12:42.004]  More people go out and write, and lew it, and chant, and protest.
[01:12:42.004 --> 01:12:43.626]  Which there might be some legitimacy to that.
[01:12:46.001 --> 01:12:47.463]  It has been for television.
[01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:49.265]  I mean, the industry is booming.
[01:12:49.265 --> 01:12:53.571]  There are over 450 original... The industry is booming because of Trump.
[01:12:53.571 --> 01:13:00.640]  Of course, there's no way anyone could possibly watch that much TV other than the president, who seems to have a lot of time for that sort of thing.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.561]  Can we just pause it right there?
[01:13:01.561 --> 01:13:02.201]  Just pause it right there.
[01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:03.370]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:03.370 --> 01:13:07.193]  Trump is about to meet in 13 different states to cut taxes.
[01:13:07.193 --> 01:13:10.296]  He's meeting all week this week with UN leaders.
[01:13:10.296 --> 01:13:11.777]  He's already met with Netanyahu.
[01:13:11.777 --> 01:13:12.958]  He's giving a speech tomorrow.
[01:13:12.958 --> 01:13:22.104]  He gives at least 3, 4, 5 speeches a week, sometimes multiple speeches a day, literally on the phone all day, working around the clock.
[01:13:22.104 --> 01:13:31.051]  And then this piece of television garbage comes out and has the nerve to say that Trump is lazy and doesn't work, he just watches TV.
[01:13:31.051 --> 01:13:31.972]  So untrue!
[01:13:33.616 --> 01:13:39.538]  Such an assault on reality that it belongs in 1984.
[01:13:39.538 --> 01:13:41.079]  Let's go ahead.
[01:13:41.079 --> 01:13:42.839]  Joining us.
[01:13:42.839 --> 01:13:44.360]  Looking forward to the tweets.
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:47.321]  I'm just so ready for these people to just be gone.
[01:13:47.321 --> 01:13:48.901]  Just gone.
[01:13:48.901 --> 01:13:51.902]  And as artists, I think we have to be honest with ourselves.
[01:13:51.902 --> 01:13:56.624]  We know the biggest TV star of the last year is Donald Trump.
[01:13:56.624 --> 01:13:57.224]  Yeah.
[01:13:57.224 --> 01:13:58.205]  No, you're not like it.
[01:13:58.205 --> 01:13:58.985]  He's the biggest star.
[01:13:58.985 --> 01:14:00.185]  In the history of the world.
[01:14:00.185 --> 01:14:01.086]  Literally in the history of the world.
[01:14:01.086 --> 01:14:01.526]  Obviously.
[01:14:06.522 --> 01:14:10.185]  They're all mad, oh my gosh, Trump is kicking our ass, what are we gonna do?
[01:14:10.185 --> 01:14:11.967]  You guys are neck and neck.
[01:14:11.967 --> 01:14:12.728]  America hates us.
[01:14:12.728 --> 01:14:16.431]  Alec, you're up against a lot of neck.
[01:14:16.431 --> 01:14:24.979]  And however you feel about the president, and you do feel about the president, you can't deny that every show was influenced by Donald Trump in some way.
[01:14:24.979 --> 01:14:31.905]  All the late night shows, obviously, House of Cards, the new season of American Horror Story, and of course... Yeah, did you see that?
[01:14:32.305 --> 01:14:38.089]  Hey, pause it for a second.
[01:14:38.089 --> 01:14:47.294]  The opening show for America Horror Stories was about people that didn't vote for Trump freaking out and literally having a mental breakdown, like Stephen Colbert is right here.
[01:14:47.294 --> 01:14:50.897]  Go ahead.
[01:14:50.897 --> 01:14:59.782]  And we all know the Emmys mean a lot to Donald Trump, because he was nominated multiple times for Celebrity Apprentice, but he never won.
[01:14:59.782 --> 01:15:01.063]  Why didn't you give him an Emmy?
[01:15:02.791 --> 01:15:08.392]  I tell you this, if he had won an Emmy, I bet he wouldn't have run for President.
[01:15:08.392 --> 01:15:12.453]  So in a way, this is all your fault.
[01:15:12.453 --> 01:15:14.694]  I thought you people loved moral compromise anti-heroes.
[01:15:14.694 --> 01:15:15.634]  Why can't you guys just be funny?
[01:15:15.634 --> 01:15:17.735]  You know, what happened to trying to be funny?
[01:15:17.735 --> 01:15:18.755]  You like Walter White?
[01:15:18.755 --> 01:15:20.555]  He's just Walter Much Whiter.
[01:15:20.555 --> 01:15:26.957]  A bunch of pilled out celebrities laugh.
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:32.981]  The president has complained repeatedly that the Emmys are rigged.
[01:15:32.981 --> 01:15:33.441]  No, duh.
[01:15:33.441 --> 01:15:34.922]  Like, that's what I'm saying.
[01:15:34.922 --> 01:15:35.862]  Here, pause it real quick.
[01:15:35.862 --> 01:15:42.204]  Like, he says something like, the president is so outrageous, he says the Emmys are rigged.
[01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:43.985]  Hey, dumbass.
[01:15:43.985 --> 01:15:46.945]  Most of America knows the Emmys are rigged.
[01:15:46.945 --> 01:15:48.726]  Like, this isn't new.
[01:15:48.726 --> 01:15:50.507]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:15:50.507 --> 01:15:51.547]  These people don't understand.
[01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:58.269]  They literally think either everyone is as dumb as they are and as ignorant as they are, or they really just assume America is completely ignorant.
[01:15:59.062 --> 01:16:03.647]  Like President Trump says the grass is green, Colbert- Did you see Trump?
[01:16:03.647 --> 01:16:05.849]  He said grass was green!
[01:16:05.849 --> 01:16:07.450]  Oh my gosh!
[01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:10.073]  Let's go back to the genius Stephen Colbert.
[01:16:10.073 --> 01:16:18.381]  Went after the host a few years back tweeting that Seth Meyers is hosting the Emmy Awards is a total joke.
[01:16:18.381 --> 01:16:21.164]  He is very awkward with almost no talent.
[01:16:21.164 --> 01:16:22.866]  Marbles in his mouth.
[01:16:23.586 --> 01:16:27.008]  I can do a better Trump impression than Colbert, okay?
[01:16:27.008 --> 01:16:29.329]  He gave it a good effort, but he's not that good.
[01:16:29.329 --> 01:16:31.330]  That's why he didn't win the Emmy, okay?
[01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:32.690]  He's upset about the Emmys right here.
[01:16:32.690 --> 01:16:33.351]  That's quite an accusation.
[01:16:33.351 --> 01:16:35.071]  Any response, Seth?
[01:16:35.071 --> 01:16:38.333]  Maybe if he would have won the Emmy, he wouldn't be complaining about Trump.
[01:16:39.597 --> 01:16:45.758]  Maybe if he did an original show and didn't spend his entire show bashing Trump, maybe then he could win an Emmy.
[01:16:45.758 --> 01:16:50.760]  So, Steven, you might want to blame yourself and your writers, because they can't make an original joke.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.060]  It's all about Trump.
[01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:53.860]  Trump would not let it go.
[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:55.101]  This actually happened.
[01:16:55.101 --> 01:16:56.001]  See, here he is again.
[01:16:56.001 --> 01:16:57.881]  He can't let go of Trump, folks.
[01:16:57.881 --> 01:16:59.162]  He can't let go.
[01:16:59.162 --> 01:17:07.744]  There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row, and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged again.
[01:17:07.744 --> 01:17:08.604]  He should have gotten it.
[01:17:10.319 --> 01:17:13.141]  Again, that endears Trump to his base.
[01:17:13.141 --> 01:17:15.362]  That endears Trump to the American people.
[01:17:15.362 --> 01:17:16.803]  They don't get it.
[01:17:16.803 --> 01:17:24.407]  They are so high off their own ignorance, their own flatulence, they probably... Oh my gosh.
[01:17:24.407 --> 01:17:26.108]  But he didn't.
[01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:36.453]  Because unlike the presidency, Emmys go to the winner of the popular votes.
[01:17:36.453 --> 01:17:37.274]  Is she crying?
[01:17:39.269 --> 01:17:42.790]  People are crying over non-funny jokes.
[01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:48.371]  Where do I find the courage to tell that joke in this room?
[01:17:48.371 --> 01:17:52.691]  Of course, what really matters to Donald Trump is ratings.
[01:17:52.691 --> 01:17:55.112]  He's got to have the big numbers.
[01:17:55.112 --> 01:17:57.132]  And I certainly hope we achieve that tonight.
[01:17:57.132 --> 01:17:59.693]  That's not what he cares about, otherwise he'd try to do a funny show.
[01:17:59.693 --> 01:18:01.693]  Is there anyone who could say how big the audience is?
[01:18:01.693 --> 01:18:02.693]  Sean, do you know?
[01:18:11.105 --> 01:18:14.966]  And here comes Sean Spicer, apparently now he hates the President True, uh, too.
[01:18:14.966 --> 01:18:17.947]  Oh my God, we got Spicer now!
[01:18:17.947 --> 01:18:25.109]  This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period!
[01:18:25.109 --> 01:18:28.749]  Both in person and around the world.
[01:18:28.749 --> 01:18:33.251]  Wow, that really soothes my fragile ego.
[01:18:33.251 --> 01:18:37.272]  Remember how they used to hate Spicer and rip Spicer and now all of a sudden they love him?
[01:18:37.272 --> 01:18:38.972]  Melissa McCarthy, everybody, give it up!
[01:18:41.889 --> 01:18:42.690]  Alright, so that's good.
[01:18:42.690 --> 01:18:51.677]  Now let's go to this clip of some other quote-unquote celebrities bashing Trump, going political at the Emmys.
[01:18:51.677 --> 01:19:01.165]  Yeah, well back in 1980 in that movie, we refused to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot.
[01:19:02.702 --> 01:19:03.422]  Really?
[01:19:03.422 --> 01:19:05.042]  What happened to you, Dolly Parton?
[01:19:05.042 --> 01:19:06.723]  You used to be so patriotic.
[01:19:06.723 --> 01:19:14.124]  And in 2017, we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, non-hypocritical villain.
[01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:17.485]  What?
[01:19:17.485 --> 01:19:21.085]  She said Trump is bad!
[01:19:21.085 --> 01:19:26.066]  That being said, tonight we're here to recognize the man who conducts the show.
[01:19:26.066 --> 01:19:27.166]  Alright, let's go to one more.
[01:19:27.166 --> 01:19:29.867]  This is an actress saying she's only rooting for the black actors.
[01:19:32.188 --> 01:19:33.990]  Who are you rooting for tonight?
[01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:36.492]  I'm rooting for, um, everybody black.
[01:19:36.492 --> 01:19:37.132]  No.
[01:19:37.132 --> 01:19:37.533]  I am.
[01:19:37.533 --> 01:19:40.275]  Imagine if a white person said they were rooting for everyone that's white.
[01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:41.156]  Be the biggest story today.
[01:19:41.156 --> 01:19:42.837]  Alright folks, don't go anywhere.
[01:19:42.837 --> 01:19:43.838]  We got more of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:57.121]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[01:19:57.121 --> 01:19:59.261]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?

[01:24:33.136 --> 01:24:42.358]  And what I specifically want to know is, what do you think about these people in Hollywood?
[01:24:42.358 --> 01:24:46.359]  What do you think about these pundits on CNN and MSNBC?
[01:24:46.359 --> 01:24:48.039]  Are they really that stupid?
[01:24:48.039 --> 01:24:49.900]  Are they really that ignorant?
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:51.760]  Perhaps they really just hate America.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:54.000]  They're conscious enemies of this country.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.841]  Or are they blackmailed?
[01:24:55.841 --> 01:24:57.341]  What is it?
[01:24:57.341 --> 01:24:58.601]  What is it?
[01:24:58.601 --> 01:25:01.662]  I want to know what the audience thinks out there.
[01:25:02.697 --> 01:25:08.340]  Before we do that, though, I have to mention some of the specials right now at Infowarsstore.com.

[01:26:32.942 --> 01:26:36.664]  This is the best toothpaste on the planet in my opinion.
[01:26:36.664 --> 01:26:38.625]  It has the iodine in there.
[01:26:38.625 --> 01:26:40.907]  It has this colloidal silver in there.
[01:26:40.907 --> 01:26:42.928]  And it doesn't have the poisonous fluoride in there.
[01:26:42.928 --> 01:26:43.328]  Look at that.

[01:27:49.419 --> 01:27:51.380]  Okay, so I want to hear from the audience.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:54.223]  We've played the clips of Hollywood.
[01:27:55.023 --> 01:28:01.985]  We've played the clips of these pundits on CNN, MSNBC, you know what they say, you know what they think.
[01:28:01.985 --> 01:28:05.346]  So I want to know, do you think that they're that stupid?
[01:28:05.346 --> 01:28:07.467]  I mean, are they genuinely that stupid?
[01:28:07.467 --> 01:28:12.528]  Do they really not understand what Trump is and what he's doing and what the Trump movement is?
[01:28:12.528 --> 01:28:14.489]  Do they just hate America that much?
[01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:16.389]  Or are they that bought and paid for?
[01:28:16.389 --> 01:28:18.070]  Are they that blackmailed?
[01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:19.330]  What do you think is going on?
[01:28:19.330 --> 01:28:23.031]  We're going to hear from you on the other side.
[01:28:23.031 --> 01:28:24.492]  But you know, I'm sitting here,
[01:28:25.782 --> 01:28:28.383]  And I'm looking at all of these stacks of news I have.
[01:28:28.383 --> 01:28:35.746]  Now this is actually from Friday, but this just shows you the nature of what they're thinking.
[01:28:35.746 --> 01:28:40.168]  From the New York Times, the big question as the UN gathers, what to make of Trump?
[01:28:40.168 --> 01:28:40.588]  So again,
[01:28:42.136 --> 01:28:49.342]  It's not about radical Islamic terror that continues to hit Europe, continues to hit the West, continues to grow.
[01:28:49.342 --> 01:28:51.023]  It's not about that.
[01:28:51.023 --> 01:28:58.710]  It's not about Kim Jong-un flying bombs over Japan, testing hydrogen bombs, threatening the United States.
[01:28:58.710 --> 01:29:02.713]  No, neither of those are the big issues according to the UN that is meeting this week.
[01:29:02.713 --> 01:29:04.855]  It's Trump.
[01:29:04.855 --> 01:29:06.156]  You know why it's Trump, folks?
[01:29:07.315 --> 01:29:12.561]  Because the UN has been working towards ending American dominance, ending American greatness.
[01:29:12.561 --> 01:29:17.046]  You see, America cannot be independent for the globalists to exist.
[01:29:17.046 --> 01:29:23.653]  America cannot thrive independently for the New World Order and the globalists to continue to reign supreme.
[01:29:24.534 --> 01:29:27.236]  So that's why the UN is upset with Trump.
[01:29:27.236 --> 01:29:31.901]  Trump is trying to make America strong, which will end the New World Order, a globalist regime.
[01:29:31.901 --> 01:29:33.602]  That's why they have to stop Trump.
[01:29:33.602 --> 01:29:37.145]  You better understand that, because that's everything right now.
[01:29:37.145 --> 01:29:38.606]  Trump is pro-America.
[01:29:38.606 --> 01:29:43.751]  If America returns, and America's independent, and America's sovereign, the New World Order dies!
[01:29:43.751 --> 01:29:45.112]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.112 --> 01:29:47.654]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.654 --> 01:29:50.337]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:55.356 --> 01:30:06.423]  A staunch anti-federalist, Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution, fearing it would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it, but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty.
[01:30:06.423 --> 01:30:09.424]  His warnings, ignored, have now come to pass.
[01:30:09.424 --> 01:30:17.989]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased, nor how you are to become a great and powerful people, but how your liberties can be secured.
[01:30:17.989 --> 01:30:20.651]  For liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[01:30:20.891 --> 01:30:29.033]  Patrick Henry warned us, the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[01:30:29.033 --> 01:30:33.354]  Today, everything the government does, at every level, is concealed from us.
[01:30:33.354 --> 01:30:38.275]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see.
[01:30:38.275 --> 01:30:44.257]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different.
[01:30:44.517 --> 01:30:46.701]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[01:30:46.701 --> 01:30:52.552]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort, when we should be demanding liberty.
[01:30:52.552 --> 01:30:54.576]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:30:55.481 --> 01:31:03.746]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[01:31:03.746 --> 01:31:04.967]  A 360 win.
[01:31:04.967 --> 01:31:11.530]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[01:31:11.530 --> 01:31:19.055]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:31:19.455 --> 01:31:24.519]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:31:24.519 --> 01:31:30.625]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:31:30.625 --> 01:31:38.431]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:31:38.431 --> 01:31:44.957]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:31:44.957 --> 01:31:46.438]  10% off on auto ship.
[01:31:51.001 --> 01:32:00.148]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:32:00.148 --> 01:32:09.956]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many
[01:32:10.216 --> 01:32:10.396]  Yeah.
[01:32:29.269 --> 01:32:29.929]  We're good.
[01:33:03.755 --> 01:33:06.482]  Another time in the age of wonder.
[01:33:16.625 --> 01:33:22.547]  You know, I'm just trying to put things in perspective here.
[01:33:22.547 --> 01:33:25.347]  As I'm reading all the stories about what happened in St.
[01:33:25.347 --> 01:33:27.468]  Louis, they're expecting more riots tonight.
[01:33:27.468 --> 01:33:30.769]  I'm seeing the mainstream news cover it.
[01:33:47.904 --> 01:33:50.186]  They're burning buildings, they're looting buildings.
[01:33:50.186 --> 01:33:51.767]  We saw what happened in Ferguson.
[01:33:51.767 --> 01:33:54.109]  We've seen other things that happened.
[01:33:54.109 --> 01:34:00.874]  When all of these charges either get dropped, the acquittals happen, there's always protest, there's always rioting, there's always looting.
[01:34:02.315 --> 01:34:24.382]  But for some reason we're just supposed to accept it, it's just supposed to be acceptable, and we're just supposed to say, okay, that's just how it goes, and it's okay for Angela Rye and Simone Sanders and Bernie Sanders and all of these people, Don Lemon, Anderson Cooper, to go on television and to tell you you're justified, America is racist, it's run by white supremacists, so go out and loot
[01:34:24.662 --> 01:34:28.866]  Go out and protest, go out and riot and burn things down, and that's okay.
[01:34:28.866 --> 01:34:38.136]  The cops are going to allow it because there's nothing they can do, and they don't want to be called racist, because of course we know that America's racist.
[01:34:38.136 --> 01:34:40.338]  But I'm just trying to put things in perspective.
[01:34:40.338 --> 01:34:45.363]  Imagine if I came on the air, or if Alex Jones came on the air and said,
[01:34:46.297 --> 01:34:55.982]  When Obama was president, we've got a black president so we need white people to go out and protest, and then that turned into rioting and looting and arson and all this stuff.
[01:34:55.982 --> 01:35:02.185]  You know that all they would talk about is how Alex Jones incites riots and how Alex Jones is anti-American.
[01:35:02.185 --> 01:35:04.686]  Now they do that anyway, even though he does none of that.
[01:35:04.686 --> 01:35:15.672]  But these people get to go on air, incite riots, incite race wars, lie about the president to do both of the previous things I mentioned, and it's just radio silence!
[01:35:17.065 --> 01:35:27.368]  It's, you know, I don't know what the answer is to stopping this, except people being arrested, unfortunately.
[01:35:27.368 --> 01:35:29.549]  And I don't know what that really entails.
[01:35:29.549 --> 01:35:30.670]  People were arrested in St.
[01:35:30.670 --> 01:35:32.850]  Louis, 80 arrests last night in St.
[01:35:32.850 --> 01:35:36.171]  Louis, yet they're expecting more today.
[01:35:36.171 --> 01:35:37.672]  So maybe arresting them won't do it.
[01:35:38.792 --> 01:35:40.414]  I don't know what you do.
[01:35:40.414 --> 01:35:48.123]  If CNN continues to give platforms to loudmouthed liars, race baiters like Angela Rye, what are we supposed to do other than just turn them off?
[01:35:48.123 --> 01:35:51.587]  How do we stop this propaganda from infecting our youth?
[01:35:51.587 --> 01:35:54.230]  But the question that I also want to ask as we go to the calls now...
[01:35:55.447 --> 01:36:15.904]  Are people like Angela Rye, Simone Sanders, Stephen Colbert, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, the list goes on and on and on, are all these people in Hollywood, all these people in the mainstream news, are these people that dumb, that ignorant, do they hate America that much, or are they genuinely bought and paid for, or just 100% blackmailed?
[01:36:17.185 --> 01:36:20.746]  That's what I want to hear from our audience, because it's just out of control.
[01:36:20.746 --> 01:36:23.207]  Let's start with Jacob in Kansas.
[01:36:23.207 --> 01:36:25.368]  He's got Emmys on his mind.
[01:36:25.368 --> 01:36:27.869]  Go ahead, Jacob.
[01:36:27.869 --> 01:36:28.749]  Yeah, my name's Jake.
[01:36:28.749 --> 01:36:29.409]  I'm from Kansas.
[01:36:29.409 --> 01:36:31.050]  How you doing, Owen?
[01:36:31.050 --> 01:36:31.390]  Doing well.
[01:36:32.788 --> 01:36:33.148]  Great.
[01:36:33.148 --> 01:36:42.031]  Well, I think that the worshipping of false idols has been a long-standing tradition since the advent of the television and the radio.
[01:36:42.031 --> 01:36:59.898]  But it brings the worshipping of the false idols to a bigger picture that, for example, with the advent of the printing press, it could be used to destroy society or to help society, to spread propaganda or to spread information that can raise people's intelligence.
[01:36:59.898 --> 01:37:00.698]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:37:01.138 --> 01:37:01.798]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:37:01.798 --> 01:37:05.499]  Just like any technology, it can be used for good or evil.
[01:37:05.499 --> 01:37:06.479]  That's right.
[01:37:06.479 --> 01:37:11.680]  And that goes to show you the examples that we see with these folks in St.
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:13.341]  Louis and other parts of our country.
[01:37:13.341 --> 01:37:24.023]  They're tearing down what we built, what we put together brick by brick, store by store, to help blossom the capitalistic part of our country.
[01:37:24.643 --> 01:37:36.535]  But you see, on the other hand, I can understand the frustration from the negative propaganda coming through the television tube, coming from the radio, and coming from the mind control music that we listen to.
[01:37:36.535 --> 01:37:39.879]  These folks, we have a problem with our education system.
[01:37:39.879 --> 01:37:46.986]  And we have a problem with indoctrinating our kids instead of helping them become educated and learning the real history.
[01:37:47.686 --> 01:37:54.051]  And so, you know, it's not just one issue with the fact that Hollywood is all bad.
[01:37:54.051 --> 01:37:57.033]  There are some good patriotic Hollywood stars.
[01:37:57.033 --> 01:37:57.453]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:57.453 --> 01:38:01.897]  You'll notice people like Matthew McConaughey are now regulated to doing TV commercials.
[01:38:01.897 --> 01:38:03.118]  Why do you think that is, folks?
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:05.181]  Exactly.
[01:38:05.181 --> 01:38:07.122]  Yeah, point well made.
[01:38:07.122 --> 01:38:15.788]  But the other side of the token is you have a lot of these folks that are disillusioned, propagandized, indoctrinated in Hollywood.
[01:38:15.788 --> 01:38:22.233]  And what we have happening is these people are also medicated by many different kinds of drugs that have taken over Hollywood.
[01:38:22.233 --> 01:38:23.014]  That's a great point.
[01:38:23.114 --> 01:38:38.586]  When you mix the propaganda with the drugs, you have people that are running amok, destroying the very country that we spent all these years building, and it just seems like now there's this bash Trump campaign, and there's no end to it.
[01:38:38.586 --> 01:38:39.627]  I see it every day.
[01:38:39.627 --> 01:38:51.116]  Every day, you know, on the news here, I watch the mainstream mind-wash news on a daily basis to look at the trash to see, you know, what they're peddling to, you know, all of us, and it makes me sick to my stomach.
[01:38:52.397 --> 01:39:03.991]  But here's another situation that we need to help make come about in this country is the fact that we need to start coming up with solutions.
[01:39:03.991 --> 01:39:04.932]  I love the show.
[01:39:04.932 --> 01:39:08.236]  I love everything, what it's about, the patriotism, Americanism, so forth.
[01:39:08.676 --> 01:39:09.336]  We're good to go.
[01:39:26.821 --> 01:39:28.982]  Delve into some of the things you said.
[01:39:28.982 --> 01:39:30.943]  First of all, he talks about the education system.
[01:39:30.943 --> 01:39:33.605]  Absolutely, the education system is failing.
[01:39:33.605 --> 01:39:40.509]  A lot of these schools that produce these kids, at least at a younger age, can't get the funding they need.
[01:39:40.509 --> 01:39:42.250]  They have to cut programs.
[01:39:42.250 --> 01:39:45.031]  The teachers don't care because they don't get paid enough.
[01:39:45.031 --> 01:39:49.254]  And it's just, honestly, it's just a terrible cycle that you just continue to go down.
[01:39:50.414 --> 01:39:54.277]  You know, I was trying to help an inner-city school in St.
[01:39:54.277 --> 01:39:58.559]  Louis that's struggling with stuff like that, and they just don't get any help from the city.
[01:39:58.559 --> 01:40:00.040]  They don't get any help from their local leaders.
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:04.102]  They don't get any help from the government because they can't get the funds they need.
[01:40:04.102 --> 01:40:08.425]  That's why we need to go towards the privatization of schools.
[01:40:08.425 --> 01:40:11.527]  Okay, that's where really higher education exists now.
[01:40:11.527 --> 01:40:13.708]  You're not getting that in any public schools.
[01:40:13.708 --> 01:40:15.529]  We can go on on that for a while.
[01:40:15.529 --> 01:40:17.951]  And then you talk about the propaganda that's being fed to them.
[01:40:19.798 --> 01:40:22.782]  And it's just like, you know, they don't know any better.
[01:40:22.782 --> 01:40:26.887]  And you talk about solutions, that's why InfoWars exists.
[01:40:26.887 --> 01:40:28.949]  That's why we are here doing this show because...
[01:40:29.893 --> 01:40:31.054]  We want to be a solution.
[01:40:31.054 --> 01:40:32.496]  We want to counter the fake news.
[01:40:32.496 --> 01:40:34.117]  We want to inject different ideas.
[01:40:34.117 --> 01:40:42.065]  We want to inject different realities that actually resonate with the average individual because they think instinctually just like we do.
[01:40:42.065 --> 01:40:45.008]  Because we're not peddling someone else's propaganda.
[01:40:45.008 --> 01:40:49.072]  And then, you know, he mentions how they go out and they loot and everything.
[01:40:49.072 --> 01:40:51.855]  Here's the sad part about that.
[01:40:51.855 --> 01:40:53.377]  They don't care about society.
[01:40:54.877 --> 01:41:00.600]  They've been told their entire lives that society hasn't given them anything so that society owes them something.
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:02.841]  Even though in this country society owes you nothing.
[01:41:02.841 --> 01:41:03.601]  You're independent.
[01:41:03.601 --> 01:41:07.082]  You build your own life, your own future, your own destiny.
[01:41:07.082 --> 01:41:08.243]  That's why America's great.
[01:41:09.329 --> 01:41:24.216]  But see, they've been lied to thinking that society owes them something, so then they're not getting what they want out of society, so then they hate society, they've never given anything to society, so then they have no problem going out on the streets burning, looting, pillaging, and protesting and rioting.
[01:41:24.216 --> 01:41:37.263]  Because this is the society that owes them so much that's given them nothing, and then they have Simone Sanders, Angela Rye, Bernie Sanders, you know, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, the list goes on and on and on, justifying them, empowering them, saying yes,
[01:41:37.683 --> 01:41:47.748]  You have the right to be upset, you have the right to riot, you've been oppressed, you're a victim, when it's them that are actually making them victims and oppressing them.
[01:41:47.748 --> 01:41:49.128]  And again, this goes on and on.
[01:41:49.128 --> 01:41:51.109]  And then he brings up drugs.
[01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:52.630]  Another excellent point.
[01:41:52.630 --> 01:41:58.992]  Most of these Hollywood stars are so pilled out of their minds, they probably can't even think clearly.
[01:41:58.992 --> 01:42:02.834]  And that's just a layman's explanation that we know is going on.
[01:42:02.834 --> 01:42:06.036]  Who else knows what goes on behind closed doors in Hollywood?
[01:42:06.036 --> 01:42:06.456]  We know...
[01:42:08.757 --> 01:42:12.881]  They don't come out and make a political statement because that's how they think or feel.
[01:42:12.881 --> 01:42:15.263]  It's because they want to get the next role.
[01:42:15.263 --> 01:42:20.568]  And now you have Jennifer Lawrence who just made a complete ass of herself twice.
[01:42:20.568 --> 01:42:22.610]  A. The movie completely flopped.
[01:42:22.610 --> 01:42:29.076]  B. She does an interview about the movie that flopped and decides to bash Trump and blame global warming and hurricanes on Trump.
[01:42:29.076 --> 01:42:31.158]  She's a complete miserable failure now.
[01:42:31.158 --> 01:42:32.459]  She's apparently going to quit acting.
[01:42:34.551 --> 01:42:36.172]  Because nobody likes her anymore.
[01:42:36.172 --> 01:42:37.712]  They don't get it.
[01:42:37.712 --> 01:42:40.433]  See, they're all obsessed with money.
[01:42:40.433 --> 01:42:42.374]  They're all obsessed with popularity.
[01:42:42.374 --> 01:42:44.595]  They're all obsessed with the spotlight.
[01:42:44.595 --> 01:42:52.638]  So they sell everything out to obtain the fake acceptance of Hollywood.
[01:42:55.248 --> 01:42:58.936]  Dramatization, the fake heroics of Hollywood, all fake.
[01:42:58.936 --> 01:43:04.829]  They sell out everything to be put in the fake life of Hollywood, in the fake film industry.
[01:43:05.936 --> 01:43:10.139]  And then they take a step back and they realize, wow, America actually hates me.
[01:43:10.139 --> 01:43:12.040]  Wow, nobody watches my films.
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:14.382]  Wow, I'm a complete jackass.
[01:43:14.382 --> 01:43:17.384]  And then people like Jennifer Lawrence, who I already said, I don't think she's that dumb.
[01:43:17.384 --> 01:43:19.186]  I think she said that to get an ex-movie role.
[01:43:19.186 --> 01:43:21.868]  Now she realizes, nobody watches my movies.
[01:43:21.868 --> 01:43:23.008]  Nobody likes me.
[01:43:23.008 --> 01:43:25.290]  Now I'm making myself out to be a jackass.
[01:43:25.290 --> 01:43:27.212]  I need to take a step back and rethink things.
[01:43:28.052 --> 01:43:30.175]  So maybe we'll see more of Hollywood do that.
[01:43:30.175 --> 01:43:33.338]  As far as solutions go, we put in President Trump.
[01:43:33.338 --> 01:43:34.519]  We always have to vote.
[01:43:34.519 --> 01:43:37.223]  We hope that President Trump is the one we thought he was.
[01:43:37.223 --> 01:43:44.391]  The next big solution to me, at least voting-wise, is the 2018 midterms.
[01:43:44.391 --> 01:43:45.872]  If we can get a Congress
[01:43:46.553 --> 01:43:46.693]  I think?
[01:44:04.685 --> 01:44:10.791]  Needs to engage on are in local government and just literally in your own house.
[01:44:10.791 --> 01:44:20.781]  You know, getting the air filters from Infowarsstore.com, getting the water filters, stop eating the GMOs, stop shopping at the big agencies that are anti-American.
[01:44:20.781 --> 01:44:25.125]  So most of that, as far as solutions go, start right at home.
[01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:26.747]  Raising your kids the right way.
[01:44:27.387 --> 01:44:31.829]  Actually raising your kids, not letting the state raise your kids or the television raise your kids.
[01:44:31.829 --> 01:44:34.051]  So these are all solutions that are really homegrown.
[01:44:34.051 --> 01:44:37.212]  Let's go to Donnie in Oregon.
[01:44:37.212 --> 01:44:39.834]  Go ahead, Donnie.
[01:44:39.834 --> 01:44:41.294]  Hey, thanks for having me, Owen.
[01:44:41.294 --> 01:44:49.199]  This is Donnie Tsunami, the psychological arsonist, and I love that you laid out a bunch of brush in front of me.
[01:44:49.199 --> 01:44:50.959]  You set me up beautifully here.
[01:44:50.959 --> 01:44:52.580]  It's all fake.
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:55.742]  And the important part here is the Bernasian bastards
[01:44:56.363 --> 01:44:57.064]  Completely agree with that.
[01:44:57.064 --> 01:44:58.665]  I think we're starting to see that happen.
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:34.124]  Absolutely, and you know that's one of the most important things we can do at this point is get people to actually read, especially the dictionary.
[01:45:34.124 --> 01:45:41.846]  Gerald Salente once issued a challenge to get a dictionary that was worth a damn, but you have to get a pretty old one for that.
[01:45:41.846 --> 01:45:48.309]  I have a 1937 unabridged Webster's Dictionary, and the thing weighs like 25 pounds!
[01:45:48.309 --> 01:45:49.690]  It's huge!
[01:45:49.690 --> 01:45:50.550]  Where'd all the words go?
[01:45:51.496 --> 01:46:18.377]  Well, I'm not sure if expanding our lexicon is the solution to all of our problems, but certainly educating yourself, reading history, knowing history, that's one thing that the globalists, that the media, and that fake politicians always use against the brainwashed masses, is the fact that they don't know their history, so then they're up there on the platform presenting history as they want it presented, or as they see it, which
[01:46:20.345 --> 01:46:21.025]  99% of it is untrue.
[01:46:21.025 --> 01:46:22.486]  Thank you for the call, Donny.
[01:46:22.486 --> 01:46:24.746]  Let's go to David in California.
[01:46:24.746 --> 01:46:27.066]  Go ahead, David.
[01:46:27.066 --> 01:46:28.047]  Hello?
[01:46:28.047 --> 01:46:29.407]  Hi.
[01:46:29.407 --> 01:46:29.667]  Hi.
[01:46:29.667 --> 01:46:30.427]  Hi, Owen.
[01:46:30.427 --> 01:46:30.947]  Love the show.
[01:46:30.947 --> 01:46:32.887]  I think you're doing a great job.
[01:46:32.887 --> 01:46:36.508]  Thank you.
[01:46:36.508 --> 01:46:47.590]  I think I see a lot of relations to Nazi Germany and the way these people are acting and
[01:46:49.332 --> 01:46:55.398]  I think they must be under some kind of mind control or possessed by the virus.
[01:46:55.398 --> 01:46:59.462]  Yeah, you know, it's almost as if... No, no, no, hold on a second.
[01:46:59.462 --> 01:47:03.505]  It's almost as if... Think about it like this.
[01:47:03.505 --> 01:47:06.748]  Hillary Clinton was the Hitlerian candidate.
[01:47:06.748 --> 01:47:11.993]  Hillary Clinton was the one that represented Hitler, and just like Germany in the late
[01:47:12.796 --> 01:47:13.016]  You think?
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:36.041]  Except virtue signaling from the entire world that America's the bad guy.
[01:47:36.041 --> 01:47:39.222]  So they were all sold already on Hitler-y.
[01:47:39.222 --> 01:47:41.663]  They were all already sold on Hitler-y.
[01:47:41.663 --> 01:47:43.824]  Hitler-y was already put into power.
[01:47:43.824 --> 01:47:47.885]  You know, 98, 99% chance Hitler-y wins.
[01:47:47.885 --> 01:47:49.926]  So they were already given their Hitler.
[01:47:49.926 --> 01:47:52.467]  They were already given their hateful leader.
[01:47:52.467 --> 01:47:56.008]  And then America said no and removed her.
[01:47:56.008 --> 01:47:58.809]  So that's also why they're totally freaking out.
[01:47:58.809 --> 01:47:59.109]  Go ahead.
[01:48:00.475 --> 01:48:01.455]  That's scary.
[01:48:01.455 --> 01:48:07.737]  I'm sorry for using the n-word, but... Alright, well, we didn't hear that, but I'm gonna have to take the next call.
[01:48:07.737 --> 01:48:10.778]  Let's go to Mike in California.
[01:48:10.778 --> 01:48:13.519]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:48:13.519 --> 01:48:15.479]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call, Owen.
[01:48:15.479 --> 01:48:18.740]  I really appreciate the fine work you guys are doing.
[01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:22.061]  I'd like to talk about the NSA in Hollywood.
[01:48:22.825 --> 01:48:29.911]  And I'm here calling from Leavenworth Street, as a matter of fact, looking down upon the beautiful and picturesque Pier 39 in San Francisco.
[01:48:29.911 --> 01:48:36.797]  And I really believe that the NSA is... Oh, what a lovely house.
[01:48:36.797 --> 01:48:37.858]  2430.
[01:48:37.858 --> 01:48:46.085]  I really believe that the NSA is responsible for a lot of the pedophilia that goes on in Hollywood.
[01:48:46.085 --> 01:48:47.966]  Have you ever heard of a guy named Michael Aquino?
[01:48:47.966 --> 01:48:51.069]  He was the former head of the NSA, Owen.
[01:48:51.738 --> 01:48:53.779]  You ever heard of him?
[01:48:53.779 --> 01:48:54.980]  No.
[01:48:54.980 --> 01:49:02.446]  Well, there was a guy that Alex Jones interviewed named Senator John DeCamp years ago.
[01:49:02.446 --> 01:49:04.827]  He wrote the Franklin cover-up.
[01:49:04.827 --> 01:49:15.074]  And John DeCamp won a million dollar judgment for Paul Benassi who was brought up to Bohemian Grove where Alex Jones infiltrated and filmed, I might add.
[01:49:15.074 --> 01:49:17.656]  And Paul Benassi was made into a snuff film there.
[01:49:17.656 --> 01:49:19.157]  And DeCamp won.
[01:49:19.157 --> 01:49:21.279]  There was still overwhelming evidence for him.
[01:49:22.089 --> 01:49:27.130]  Uh, that John Decamp, who wrote the Franklin cover, won a million dollars for Paul Benassi.
[01:49:27.130 --> 01:49:39.313]  And Paul Benassi says he was also taken up into the house of the former head of, uh, Michael Aquino, uh, there on, uh, in San Francisco and raped and tortured.
[01:49:39.313 --> 01:49:47.215]  And David Scherter, who wrote Rabbit Hole, who I've spoken with personally, um, uh, also testifies that Michael Aquino
[01:49:48.067 --> 01:49:51.949]  Uh, has murdered and raped dozens and dozens of children.
[01:49:51.949 --> 01:50:06.855]  And when, uh, Oprah Winfrey back in 88 got the police report, uh, for about Michael Aquino, how he was exposed in, uh, 80s, in the 80s, for raping a bunch of kids at the Park Presidio, she interviewed Michael Aquino with Ted Gunderson.
[01:50:06.855 --> 01:50:09.276]  I don't know if you know, Ted was a great guy from the FBI.
[01:50:09.276 --> 01:50:12.778]  Yeah, former FBI whistleblower.
[01:50:12.778 --> 01:50:15.519]  Yeah, and Ted just demolished Michael Aquino.
[01:50:16.159 --> 01:50:22.385]  Uh, but unfortunately, uh, they still haven't been able to arrest and execute him, uh, because he's CIA.
[01:50:22.385 --> 01:50:30.132]  Well, I'm not really sure about any of that and I'm not really sure how that connects to, uh, the NSA.
[01:50:30.132 --> 01:50:31.913]  Well, here's what first came to my mind.
[01:50:32.774 --> 01:50:34.856]  You got the CIA, the NSA, you got Vault 7.
[01:50:34.856 --> 01:50:37.618]  Folks, they have access to everything you do digitally.
[01:50:37.618 --> 01:50:40.360]  You know how easy that makes it to blackmail people?
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:47.126]  They see you go one wrong step on the dark web, or one wrong step on anything, or maybe they implant something on your computer.
[01:50:47.126 --> 01:50:48.127]  Boom!
[01:50:48.127 --> 01:50:49.688]  All of a sudden they can blackmail you.
[01:50:49.688 --> 01:50:51.029]  That is how it works.
[01:50:51.029 --> 01:50:51.570]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:50:51.570 --> 01:50:52.851]  More of the Alex Jones Show on the other side.
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:56.681]  North Korea openly threatens the U.S.
[01:50:56.681 --> 01:50:58.582]  and launches a new missile every other week.
[01:50:58.582 --> 01:50:59.843]  Their warhead of choice?
[01:50:59.843 --> 01:51:01.264]  Electromagnetic pulse.
[01:51:01.264 --> 01:51:02.744]  Such an event would cripple the U.S.
[01:51:02.744 --> 01:51:05.206]  power grid for years and leave millions in the dark.
[01:51:05.206 --> 01:51:05.886]  Are you ready?

[01:53:23.413 --> 01:53:25.554]  You've heard the phrase, you are what you eat?
[01:53:25.554 --> 01:53:26.335]  Not true.
[01:53:26.335 --> 01:53:28.176]  Actually, you are what you can absorb.
[01:53:28.176 --> 01:53:32.119]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are they?
[01:53:32.119 --> 01:53:33.239]  Introducing Protovite.

[01:54:09.749 --> 01:54:15.332]  Trump lawyers clash over how much to cooperate with Russia inquiry.
[01:54:15.332 --> 01:54:21.496]  Well, they've been cooperative for almost a year now and they've still found nothing, so I'd be getting kind of fed up with it.
[01:54:21.496 --> 01:54:26.019]  Meanwhile, Mueller picks another Clinton-Obama donor for Russia probe team.
[01:54:26.019 --> 01:54:31.262]  That's the ninth lawyer on that team that's donated to Democrats.
[01:54:31.262 --> 01:54:34.204]  You want to talk about collusion, you want to talk about witch hunt.
[01:54:34.969 --> 01:54:36.429]  That's where it is right there.
[01:54:36.429 --> 01:54:42.271]  By the way, Ty Cobb is one of the lawyers in there, and he's a real hard hitter, folks.
[01:54:42.271 --> 01:54:50.353]  And with a name like Ty Cobb, I always kind of felt like he was going to be in charge of some big hits, if you will.
[01:54:50.353 --> 01:54:56.755]  And ironically, Ty Cobb was victimized by fake news over a hundred years ago, calling him a racist.
[01:54:56.755 --> 01:54:58.075]  That's the baseball player, of course.
[01:54:58.915 --> 01:55:01.176]  So, I'm just throwing that weird history out.
[01:55:01.176 --> 01:55:03.337]  Let's go back to the callers before I completely lose it.
[01:55:03.337 --> 01:55:05.258]  Let's go to Alicia in Oregon.
[01:55:05.258 --> 01:55:05.998]  Go ahead, Alicia.
[01:55:05.998 --> 01:55:08.900]  Hi, Owen.
[01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:10.520]  Hi.
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:11.080]  Can you hear me?
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:11.901]  Yeah.
[01:55:11.901 --> 01:55:12.981]  Okay.
[01:55:12.981 --> 01:55:21.925]  I was just gonna say, you know, your first caller, I don't know, he's got like a Vulcan mind meld or whatever, but he pretty much crystallized what my call was gonna be about.
[01:55:21.925 --> 01:55:25.187]  About how, you know, I heard this on
[01:55:26.465 --> 01:55:38.856]  The Steven Crowder broadcast, I believe this was last week, but basically we need to be more active culturally, because that's where we're going to make the biggest impact.
[01:55:38.856 --> 01:55:45.782]  I mean, I know we like...Republicans, historically, they've always been, you know, the ones that have these
[01:55:46.223 --> 01:55:49.505]  You know, kind of stuffy publications, you know, that's how they make their names out.
[01:55:49.505 --> 01:55:53.266]  Well, do you think we're not, do you think we're not fighting the culture war hard enough?
[01:55:53.266 --> 01:55:55.828]  I think we're taking back culture pretty, pretty swiftly here.
[01:55:55.828 --> 01:56:01.070]  I mean, it's not going to happen overnight, but I think we're dominating the culture war right now.
[01:56:01.070 --> 01:56:03.171]  I think that we are learning.
[01:56:03.171 --> 01:56:06.153]  I think we're doing a good job, but I think that we can do more.
[01:56:06.153 --> 01:56:07.673]  I mean, look at the Emmys.
[01:56:07.673 --> 01:56:10.415]  I mean, the Emmys, Emmy ratings completely tanked.
[01:56:10.415 --> 01:56:12.115]  Hollywood is completely tanking.
[01:56:12.115 --> 01:56:13.076]  I mean, those are victories.
[01:56:14.443 --> 01:56:15.843]  Of course they are, of course.
[01:56:15.843 --> 01:56:18.824]  And that's where we're seeing a lot of the victory.
[01:56:18.824 --> 01:56:28.706]  And that's why I think that Generation Z, according to all the studies I've seen, they're going to be the most conservative generation since the 1940s.
[01:56:28.706 --> 01:56:29.906]  But we gotta keep at it.
[01:56:29.906 --> 01:56:33.887]  We can't just, you know, let loose again.
[01:56:33.887 --> 01:56:39.288]  Because, I mean, the reason why things are so bad right now is because we allowed them to get this bad.
[01:56:39.288 --> 01:56:41.188]  And we can't make that same mistake again.
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:51.184]  No, I totally hear you, and a lot of that is because we've been completely separated from God, worshiping false idols, and our children have no idea who God is.
[01:56:51.184 --> 01:56:52.685]  Thank you for the call, Alicia.
[01:56:52.685 --> 01:56:55.206]  They also have no idea about our history, so they're doomed to repeat it.
[01:56:55.206 --> 01:56:55.946]  Let's take another call.
[01:56:55.946 --> 01:56:58.488]  Let's go to Kimberly in my home state of Missouri.
[01:56:58.488 --> 01:56:59.168]  Go ahead, Kimberly.
[01:57:01.010 --> 01:57:04.153]  Hey Owen, thank you so much for taking the call.
[01:57:04.153 --> 01:57:05.634]  I really appreciate it.
[01:57:05.634 --> 01:57:08.437]  I have two really important things to share with you.
[01:57:08.437 --> 01:57:12.981]  First of all, it's just an example of Hollywood and what a bunch of idiots they are.
[01:57:12.981 --> 01:57:21.249]  I've dealt directly and have known Lisa Paulson, who's the President and CEO of the Entertainment Industry Foundation.
[01:57:21.249 --> 01:57:21.690]  This is the
[01:57:24.843 --> 01:57:29.386]  What's the charity again?
[01:57:29.386 --> 01:57:33.870]  One more time?
[01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:35.051]  EIF.
[01:57:35.051 --> 01:57:37.713]  The Entertainment Industry Foundation.
[01:57:37.713 --> 01:57:38.694]  Okay?
[01:57:38.694 --> 01:57:50.343]  Now, I had known Lisa for about 20 years, you know, not, you know, real personally, but I knew her well enough to call her and she would take my call and immediately respond to my email.
[01:57:51.010 --> 01:57:59.175]  We were doing a project and we had raised almost $10 million and this was for a second show.
[01:57:59.175 --> 01:58:02.517]  I'm a veteran and this show was for the veterans.
[01:58:02.517 --> 01:58:08.700]  We were re-updating the old Bob Hope Show.
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:11.802]  We were bringing it back, you know, and literally traveling around.
[01:58:12.622 --> 01:58:19.044]  And there were people who would not deal with us that were just flat-out rude.
[01:58:19.044 --> 01:58:23.425]  You know, like, um, let's say, uh, the USO was one of them.
[01:58:23.425 --> 01:58:30.006]  We didn't want to deal with them because they wanted to take, we had USA Bank as a huge sponsor.
[01:58:30.006 --> 01:58:32.667]  Alright folks, this is the Alex Jones Show, third hour on the other side.
[01:58:32.667 --> 01:58:35.868]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:58:35.868 --> 01:58:39.268]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:59:55.151 --> 01:59:57.853]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:57.853 --> 02:00:02.976]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:06.775 --> 02:00:12.057]  Alright, we've got some breaking news right now on social media and free speech.
[02:00:12.057 --> 02:00:17.078]  The monopolies that run the internet ghettos are trying to silence their competition.
[02:00:17.078 --> 02:00:18.679]  So we'll have news on that in a second.
[02:00:18.679 --> 02:00:23.580]  But first, here's a video of a feminist protest gone wrong.
[02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:25.641]  Well, you shouldn't have protested at a Muslim event.
[02:00:25.641 --> 02:00:30.502]  So there's the feminists.
[02:00:30.502 --> 02:00:32.563]  They take their tops off.
[02:00:32.563 --> 02:00:35.064]  And they are now taking over a Muslim event.
[02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:39.223]  Grabbing the mic, frothing at the mouth feminists.
[02:00:39.223 --> 02:00:41.105]  Holding their fists in the air.
[02:00:41.105 --> 02:00:44.848]  And now here come the Muslims in charge of the event.
[02:00:44.848 --> 02:00:46.830]  They take her, they drag her off stage.
[02:00:46.830 --> 02:00:48.852]  Now they've got her on the ground and there it goes!
[02:00:48.852 --> 02:00:50.814]  They are brutally beating her.
[02:00:50.814 --> 02:00:55.679]  Now she's getting pummeled and kicked and beaten to a bloody pulp at the Muslim event.
[02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:03.724]  So feminist protester protests a Muslim event actually makes sense.
[02:01:03.724 --> 02:01:06.426]  The religion of Islam that oppresses women.
[02:01:06.426 --> 02:01:17.615]  In a lot of these Islamic countries women can't drive, they have no rights, they can't even leave the house, they can't without their hood over their head, they can't even leave the house without a man or they can be arrested or raped or thrown in jail.
[02:01:17.615 --> 02:01:19.817]  So I give these feminists credit.
[02:01:19.817 --> 02:01:21.298]  They go out there and they protest
[02:01:22.651 --> 02:01:32.235]  Oppressive Islam against women, and then they learn the hard way how oppressive Islam really is against women as they get beaten to a bloody pulp.
[02:01:32.235 --> 02:01:37.498]  But you won't see any of the liberal media covering that, will you?
[02:01:37.498 --> 02:01:38.118]  Nothing.
[02:01:38.118 --> 02:01:38.498]  Nothing.
[02:01:38.498 --> 02:01:45.761]  Because Islam is the religion of peace as they blow people up all over Europe and beat a feminist protester.
[02:01:45.761 --> 02:01:47.362]  Okay, so now here's the breaking news.
[02:01:48.561 --> 02:01:51.122]  This is from Jamie White at Infowars.com.
[02:01:51.122 --> 02:01:56.545]  Google tech giants threaten to shut down free speech social site.
[02:01:56.545 --> 02:02:03.849]  Search engine giant Google and other tech platforms have threatened to shut down free speech social media site Gab in the name of fighting hate speech.
[02:02:03.849 --> 02:02:07.811]  So Gab is now considered hate speech even though it's nothing but free speech.
[02:02:07.811 --> 02:02:10.853]  The Hill, alt-right Twitter rival, may lose its web domain.
[02:02:10.853 --> 02:02:12.053]  So boom!
[02:02:12.053 --> 02:02:16.216]  They try to label it alt-right, which they've already labeled as racist white supremacist.
[02:02:16.216 --> 02:02:16.796]  Totally false.
[02:02:18.069 --> 02:02:21.830]  Google faces lawsuit over removing Gab from Play Store.
[02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:22.490]  So there you go.
[02:02:22.490 --> 02:02:28.412]  Now Google is censoring the content that you have access to.
[02:02:28.412 --> 02:02:30.453]  That's Stasi techniques.
[02:02:30.453 --> 02:02:32.954]  That's Hitlerian techniques.
[02:02:32.954 --> 02:02:40.676]  And so here was a report from Fox talking about the hypocrisy on the social media giants.
[02:02:40.676 --> 02:02:42.877]  They claim they're diverse, but it's not true.
[02:02:42.877 --> 02:02:43.437]  Here's that clip.
[02:02:44.261 --> 02:02:50.643]  And you know, Ashley, Facebook loves painting itself as this forward-thinking, progressive, and inclusive company.
[02:02:50.643 --> 02:02:55.344]  But one look at Facebook's own workforce and you're slapped in the face with hypocrisy.
[02:02:55.344 --> 02:02:58.785]  Only 3% of the company's employees are African-American.
[02:02:58.785 --> 02:03:00.646]  Only 5% are Hispanic.
[02:03:00.646 --> 02:03:06.528]  So if Zuckerberg and Facebook want to lecture the rest of us on inclusion, they should practice what they preach.
[02:03:07.228 --> 02:03:08.749]  Oh my gosh!
[02:03:08.749 --> 02:03:12.471]  How dare Fox report the truth about Facebook and Google!
[02:03:12.471 --> 02:03:14.233]  They claim they're diverse!
[02:03:14.233 --> 02:03:16.374]  Claim they're for minorities!
[02:03:16.374 --> 02:03:17.755]  Bunch of bull!
[02:03:17.755 --> 02:03:22.338]  And the only reason why they support DACA is so they can bring in cheap labor!
[02:03:22.338 --> 02:03:24.179]  This is actually, this is amazing.
[02:03:24.179 --> 02:03:27.861]  So, Andrew Torba, he is the creator of Gab.
[02:03:27.861 --> 02:03:33.125]  He's gonna be on the Alex Jones Show with Alex Jones tomorrow to cover all of this.
[02:03:33.125 --> 02:03:35.286]  But again, we've been telling you that this is coming.
[02:03:36.619 --> 02:03:37.260]  And you know what?
[02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:39.481]  We've had callers call in and talk about taking action.
[02:03:39.481 --> 02:03:40.702]  Here's how you can take action.
[02:03:40.702 --> 02:03:43.324]  Go out, download Gab.
[02:03:43.324 --> 02:03:44.525]  Go get Gab right now.
[02:03:44.525 --> 02:03:45.646]  Go create a Gab account.
[02:03:45.646 --> 02:03:47.687]  Go invest in Gab.
[02:03:47.687 --> 02:03:49.709]  They want to remove Gab.
[02:03:49.709 --> 02:03:51.510]  Obviously, Gab is where we need to go.
[02:03:51.510 --> 02:03:56.154]  See, Gab is set up to directly compete with Twitter.
[02:03:57.791 --> 02:03:59.612]  So, you can't have that.
[02:03:59.612 --> 02:04:04.393]  Because you see, Twitter is one of these internet ghettos that controls your free speech.
[02:04:04.393 --> 02:04:04.913]  We've seen it.
[02:04:04.913 --> 02:04:06.234]  They've kicked Milo off.
[02:04:06.234 --> 02:04:08.374]  They've kicked a ton of people off.
[02:04:08.374 --> 02:04:12.195]  And they keep responses from getting to President Trump.
[02:04:12.195 --> 02:04:13.676]  They'll censor responses.
[02:04:13.676 --> 02:04:15.096]  They'll censor Don Jr.'
[02:04:15.076 --> 02:04:15.476]  's tweets.
[02:04:15.476 --> 02:04:17.757]  They'll censor President Trump's tweets.
[02:04:17.757 --> 02:04:21.458]  They'll remove people if they don't like their opinion.
[02:04:21.458 --> 02:04:23.459]  So, you got all of this going on.
[02:04:24.938 --> 02:04:36.700]  And it's just an example of how they're trying to skirt the First Amendment by putting everyone onto these free speech plantations that are actually not free speech, and then censoring everything you see there.
[02:04:36.700 --> 02:04:38.661]  So that's what's actually going on.
[02:04:38.661 --> 02:04:40.881]  That's the real censorship.
[02:04:40.881 --> 02:04:42.882]  Those are the real people that hate free speech.
[02:04:42.882 --> 02:04:48.423]  It's the people at Google, the people at Facebook, and the people at Twitter that want to shut down any competition they have.
[02:04:51.555 --> 02:04:58.142]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[02:04:58.142 --> 02:04:59.183]  You know what?
[02:05:04.856 --> 02:05:10.622]  Welcome to The War Room, the latest expansion in InfoWars live broadcasting.

[02:05:34.282 --> 02:05:37.883]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[02:05:37.883 --> 02:05:40.804]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[02:05:40.804 --> 02:05:42.064]  This is The War Room.
[02:05:52.014 --> 02:05:57.477]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:05:57.477 --> 02:05:59.578]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:05:59.578 --> 02:06:04.861]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:06:04.861 --> 02:06:08.583]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[02:06:08.723 --> 02:06:12.144]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:06:12.144 --> 02:06:15.345]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:06:15.345 --> 02:06:19.207]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:06:19.207 --> 02:06:26.369]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:06:26.369 --> 02:06:32.511]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine,
[02:06:32.691 --> 02:06:34.092]  Nanosilver and more.
[02:06:34.092 --> 02:06:42.376]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.
[02:06:42.376 --> 02:06:50.681]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.

[02:08:09.776 --> 02:08:13.641]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.114 --> 02:08:21.016]  Alright, so we've got UN meetings going on all week.
[02:08:21.016 --> 02:08:23.699]  President Trump is set to speak tomorrow.
[02:08:23.699 --> 02:08:26.701]  The biggest issue on the UN's mind is Trump.
[02:08:26.701 --> 02:08:27.802]  What are we going to do about Trump?
[02:08:27.802 --> 02:08:29.443]  He's actually an American president.
[02:08:29.443 --> 02:08:31.425]  He actually wants to put the people of America first.
[02:08:31.425 --> 02:08:32.446]  We can't have that.
[02:08:32.446 --> 02:08:34.287]  We have to keep America down.
[02:08:34.287 --> 02:08:37.930]  We have to put our foot on America's head and drown them.
[02:08:37.930 --> 02:08:40.112]  And Trump is not putting his foot on our head.
[02:08:40.112 --> 02:08:42.154]  He wants us to breathe and to be successful.
[02:08:42.154 --> 02:08:43.395]  So the UN has to do something about that.
[02:08:44.591 --> 02:08:49.053]  I'm now being told that China and Russia apparently were skipping UN meetings today.
[02:08:49.053 --> 02:08:50.014]  That's very interesting.
[02:08:50.014 --> 02:08:53.635]  Of course, President Trump met with Netanyahu today as well.
[02:08:53.635 --> 02:08:59.138]  Folks, in case you haven't noticed, InfoWars is now live 10 hours a day.

[02:09:46.901 --> 02:09:50.103]  You got the DEET Free Herbal Bug Spray.
[02:09:50.103 --> 02:10:00.768]  So instead of the absolute poisonous chemicals, just 100% poisonous chemicals that are in bug spray, DEET being the leader, we give you an organic bug spray that doesn't poison you.

[02:10:06.351 --> 02:10:09.293]  This is a body wash you use in the shower.
[02:10:09.293 --> 02:10:09.933]  I use it myself.
[02:10:11.380 --> 02:10:16.385]  It actually, I guess it's unscented, but it has a nice smell to it, actually.
[02:10:16.385 --> 02:10:19.949]  So it's actually good smelling, but again, this is organic.
[02:10:19.949 --> 02:10:22.492]  No harmful chemicals in the body wash.
[02:10:22.492 --> 02:10:24.654]  Pure tea tree shampoo.
[02:10:24.654 --> 02:10:25.455]  Great shampoo.
[02:10:25.455 --> 02:10:26.195]  I use the shampoo.
[02:10:26.195 --> 02:10:28.818]  I can't believe how much it foams up and makes my hair smell good.
[02:10:28.818 --> 02:10:30.980]  And then the long-lasting natural deodorant.
[02:10:30.980 --> 02:10:32.101]  So the entire line.

[02:11:36.195 --> 02:11:38.377]  Especially if you have pets.
[02:11:38.377 --> 02:11:39.157]  That's one thing.
[02:11:39.157 --> 02:11:41.840]  If you have pets, you will notice it.
[02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:43.382]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:11:43.382 --> 02:11:45.103]  Alexa Pure Breeze Air Purifier.
[02:11:45.103 --> 02:11:45.704]  I have one.
[02:11:45.704 --> 02:11:47.325]  I absolutely love it.
[02:11:47.325 --> 02:11:49.007]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:11:49.007 --> 02:11:52.691]  Check out all of our groundbreaking products.
[02:11:54.016 --> 02:12:02.980]  So you've got Google, Twitter, Facebook, the tech giant monopolies trying to stop anyone from competing with them.
[02:12:02.980 --> 02:12:05.121]  How dare you compete with Twitter?
[02:12:05.121 --> 02:12:08.243]  How dare you compete with Facebook?
[02:12:08.243 --> 02:12:16.967]  Don't you know these are globalist-run companies that hate America and hate free speech, so you can't compete because you will only uplift America and uplift free speech.
[02:12:16.967 --> 02:12:17.968]  We can't have that.
[02:12:17.968 --> 02:12:18.948]  And you know who that sounds like?
[02:12:18.948 --> 02:12:20.029]  How about Saudi Arabia?
[02:12:21.095 --> 02:12:24.496]  Snapchat blocks Al Jazeera channel from users in Saudi Arabia.
[02:12:24.496 --> 02:12:25.396]  Snapchat Inc.
[02:12:25.396 --> 02:12:36.018]  said Sunday it has followed a request from the Saudi Arabian government to block access to Al Jazeera news articles and videos on its Snapchat social media app to residents in Saudi Arabia.
[02:12:36.018 --> 02:12:41.719]  So now we're treating social media just like they do in Saudi Arabia.
[02:12:41.719 --> 02:12:46.079]  I guess that's American though.
[02:12:46.079 --> 02:12:49.400]  I guess that's just pro-America to censor free speech.
[02:12:50.407 --> 02:12:52.429]  So no, we have to uplift Gab now.
[02:12:52.429 --> 02:12:54.511]  We have to uplift InfoWars.com.
[02:12:54.511 --> 02:12:56.453]  We have to be more powerful than ever.
[02:12:56.453 --> 02:13:03.881]  And that's by you getting on Gab, and that's by you going to InfoWarsStore.com and supporting us by purchasing our products.
[02:13:03.881 --> 02:13:07.305]  Okay, again, before I go to your calls, you've got the UN meeting this week.
[02:13:07.305 --> 02:13:09.107]  Trump is at the top of their agenda.
[02:13:09.107 --> 02:13:11.369]  Not radical Islam, not North Korea.
[02:13:11.369 --> 02:13:12.590]  Trump will speak tomorrow.
[02:13:13.547 --> 02:13:15.147]  How about this?
[02:13:15.147 --> 02:13:20.069]  Meanwhile, though, the media is triggered by Trump tweeting a video of him hitting a golf ball.
[02:13:20.069 --> 02:13:25.570]  The media is pissed off that Trump donated a million dollars to hurricane relief.
[02:13:25.570 --> 02:13:26.811]  The left can't handle that.
[02:13:26.811 --> 02:13:29.652]  The left can't handle the fact that President Trump is kicking ass.
[02:13:29.652 --> 02:13:32.152]  The left can't handle the fact that we're winning the culture war.
[02:13:32.152 --> 02:13:34.493]  So they just spread lies and disinformation.
[02:13:34.493 --> 02:13:37.254]  Six dreamers sued Trump administration over DACA decision.
[02:13:38.086 --> 02:13:40.648]  From Newstrust.org.
[02:13:40.648 --> 02:13:44.550]  This has to be the most ironic news story I've ever read.
[02:13:44.550 --> 02:13:52.134]  So, first of all, they haven't even made a decision on DACA, except to leave it in the hands of Congress.
[02:13:52.134 --> 02:13:55.296]  So the entire notion of this lawsuit is frivolous.
[02:13:55.296 --> 02:13:59.839]  But let's not forget, DACA was Obama's bill!
[02:13:59.839 --> 02:14:02.120]  Why are you suing Trump?
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:04.041]  Trump is going to help you!
[02:14:04.041 --> 02:14:04.782]  Don't you get it?
[02:14:06.155 --> 02:14:12.877]  I mean, my goodness, people are just so... What do you call it?
[02:14:12.877 --> 02:14:14.277]  I mean, seriously, what do you call it?
[02:14:14.277 --> 02:14:17.878]  What do you call someone that doesn't live in reality?
[02:14:17.878 --> 02:14:24.940]  What do you call someone that acts impulsively on something that doesn't exist?
[02:14:24.940 --> 02:14:26.460]  It's like beyond a phobia.
[02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:30.381]  It's like their entire life is a phobia.
[02:14:30.381 --> 02:14:34.942]  So Trump, sticking up for DACA, I think he's actually going to make these people citizens.
[02:14:36.718 --> 02:14:47.183]  Hands it over to Congress, Obama created this mess, all the past presidents created this mess by not enforcing the law at the border, and then it's all Trump's fault and they're gonna sue Trump.
[02:14:47.183 --> 02:14:51.144]  Even though he hasn't even done anything yet!
[02:14:51.144 --> 02:14:53.906]  Honestly, it's impossible to cover this!
[02:14:53.906 --> 02:14:59.928]  It's so outrageous, it's so non-existent in reality, that how do you even cover this?
[02:14:59.928 --> 02:15:05.091]  Except just to say, here's what's going on, here's the liberal madness, here's the mental disorder,
[02:15:06.072 --> 02:15:08.453]  Here's how fake news propagandizes people.
[02:15:08.453 --> 02:15:09.293]  Wow!
[02:15:09.293 --> 02:15:10.693]  And then you have this.
[02:15:10.693 --> 02:15:13.234]  Washington Post writer says Trump is killing him.
[02:15:13.234 --> 02:15:14.095]  Literally!
[02:15:14.095 --> 02:15:20.677]  Dana Milbank, a writer for the Washington Compost, believes President Trump is literally killing him.
[02:15:20.677 --> 02:15:23.037]  He says, President Trump is killing me.
[02:15:23.037 --> 02:15:23.578]  No, really.
[02:15:23.578 --> 02:15:24.498]  He's killing me.
[02:15:25.629 --> 02:15:30.051]  And then you have American Horror Story, a popular series on FX.
[02:15:30.051 --> 02:15:38.414]  They do their opening show about the Trump derangement syndrome and how Hillary Clinton voters literally have gone mentally insane.
[02:15:38.414 --> 02:15:44.637]  Hillary Clinton voters and Trump detractors have literally gone mentally insane.
[02:15:44.637 --> 02:15:46.198]  So think about that.
[02:15:46.198 --> 02:15:46.858]  Think about that.
[02:15:47.867 --> 02:16:04.272]  You have at least 50 million people in this country that are mentally insane and they don't even know it yet and no one has actually put them into the category of mentally insane where they probably belong in a straitjacket in a rubber room.
[02:16:04.272 --> 02:16:09.273]  So we'll just continue to deal with the absolute madness that are these people.
[02:16:10.199 --> 02:16:13.502]  Yeah, I actually watched the opening episode because I heard about it.
[02:16:13.502 --> 02:16:19.707]  It is very accurate, and you have people that literally have mental breakdowns because Trump won.
[02:16:19.707 --> 02:16:21.409]  Alright, let's go back out to the phone lines.
[02:16:21.409 --> 02:16:23.891]  Let's go to Jerry in Florida.
[02:16:23.891 --> 02:16:24.611]  Go ahead, Jerry.
[02:16:24.611 --> 02:16:27.614]  Hi, Erwin.
[02:16:27.614 --> 02:16:29.195]  Hi.
[02:16:29.195 --> 02:16:30.416]  Can you hear me?
[02:16:30.416 --> 02:16:37.723]  Okay, hey, real quick before I get on a roll here, I want to thank the linemen from Texas who came to Florida to
[02:16:38.755 --> 02:16:43.018]  To pull our bacon out of the fire, I can't thank those guys enough.
[02:16:43.018 --> 02:16:46.721]  Everywhere I looked, Texas plates.
[02:16:46.721 --> 02:16:52.566]  Okay, wow, so you're talking about people coming together in times of tragedy, wow, absolutely.
[02:16:52.566 --> 02:16:58.371]  Yeah, and I just really, and I sincerely mean it, I want to thank those guys.
[02:16:58.371 --> 02:17:03.194]  Solutions, you said that when liberal progressives go grab microphones at
[02:17:05.842 --> 02:17:18.446]  If Muslim events, and they end up getting their heads beat in, well then, I think InfoWars and all of the new media should spend a great deal of their time promoting these events for liberal progressives to go to.
[02:17:18.446 --> 02:17:19.826]  Problem solved.
[02:17:19.826 --> 02:17:30.849]  Well, the problem is in America, the problem is in America, they've allied with one another, so... Yeah, but if you keep sending enough of them and they keep getting their heads beat in, then, you know, it goes to zero.
[02:17:32.527 --> 02:17:36.068]  Well, that's how a logical mind would work.
[02:17:36.068 --> 02:17:42.070]  However, as I just said, we're dealing with people that have literally gone mentally insane.
[02:17:42.070 --> 02:17:44.671]  Right, which brings me to my final point here.
[02:17:44.671 --> 02:17:59.275]  I was watching a, this was as close to 80s as I ever want to be, I spent the afternoon with my wife watching a chick flick yesterday to pass time because we were just, you know, happy to have the air conditioning back on finally.
[02:18:00.151 --> 02:18:16.199]  On Lifetime, I think was the network, they had a program and it was called something like Flowers in the Attic where it was about two children that a crazy mother had locked in an attic for like three years and the brother and sister became incestuous.
[02:18:16.199 --> 02:18:25.463]  And then stemming from that as they grew, it was every combination of totally screwed up relationship in that family that you could ever think of.
[02:18:26.375 --> 02:18:35.559]  And, of course, they normalized the brother and sister marriage, because they were liberal.
[02:18:35.559 --> 02:18:48.345]  But the one quote-unquote son, there were two, but one of them was like purely evil, and he was very religious, and he was, of course, conservative.
[02:18:48.345 --> 02:18:54.948]  Well, it was funny to watch the psychology going on in this thing, and then here comes the kicker.
[02:18:55.854 --> 02:19:02.960]  Every commercial that they would go to was about antidepressant drugs.
[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:05.041]  It was just, it was a sight to behold.
[02:19:05.041 --> 02:19:06.502]  It was fun to watch.
[02:19:06.502 --> 02:19:11.766]  See, and that's why I love taking calls, because you guys put the strings together that we forget.
[02:19:11.766 --> 02:19:19.993]  Yeah, look at the country, look at the percentage of people that are on antidepressant drugs, look at the side effects of these drugs.
[02:19:20.433 --> 02:19:21.854]  Look at the opioid crisis.
[02:19:21.854 --> 02:19:24.796]  Look at what's happened in Afghanistan with the opioid coming in.
[02:19:24.796 --> 02:19:27.438]  The opiates coming in from Afghanistan and the poppy fields.
[02:19:27.438 --> 02:19:29.320]  Wow, thank you so much for that call, Jerry.
[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:30.621]  Absolutely, yes.
[02:19:30.621 --> 02:19:37.045]  A lot of this can be linked directly to the pill heads in Hollywood and at college universities.
[02:19:37.045 --> 02:19:37.706]  Absolutely.
[02:19:37.706 --> 02:19:39.487]  We'll be right back with more of your calls.
[02:19:39.487 --> 02:19:41.349]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:41.349 --> 02:19:43.250]  You found it, the tip of the spear, folks.
[02:19:43.250 --> 02:19:45.752]  We're going to be hearing from Alex Jones in this hour again.
[02:19:51.189 --> 02:19:53.150]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:19:53.150 --> 02:19:58.472]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:19:58.472 --> 02:20:00.052]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:20:00.052 --> 02:20:08.416]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:20:08.416 --> 02:20:14.098]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:20:14.298 --> 02:20:16.100]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:20:16.100 --> 02:20:18.362]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:20:18.362 --> 02:20:22.767]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:20:22.767 --> 02:20:24.969]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[02:21:21.824 --> 02:21:22.564]  Anywhere.
[02:21:22.564 --> 02:21:25.666]  Radio remains the most intimate of all forms of media.
[02:21:25.666 --> 02:21:26.246]  At home.
[02:21:26.246 --> 02:21:26.886]  At work.
[02:21:26.886 --> 02:21:27.707]  In the car.
[02:21:27.707 --> 02:21:29.227]  On smartphones.
[02:21:29.227 --> 02:21:32.389]  Over 90% of consumers still listen to radio every week.
[02:21:32.389 --> 02:21:38.032]  That makes choosing radio as a place to advertise your business one of the best decisions you can make.

[02:21:48.537 --> 02:21:49.197]  Effective.
[02:21:49.717 --> 02:21:50.738]  It's been said.
[02:21:50.738 --> 02:21:54.181]  Any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[02:21:54.181 --> 02:21:55.783]  Those times may be near.
[02:21:55.783 --> 02:21:56.683]  Think about it.
[02:21:56.683 --> 02:22:01.308]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[02:22:01.308 --> 02:22:05.952]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[02:22:06.292 --> 02:22:12.095]  And a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[02:22:12.095 --> 02:22:18.799]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[02:22:18.799 --> 02:22:21.341]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[02:22:21.801 --> 02:22:24.603]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[02:23:19.917 --> 02:23:22.299]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[02:23:22.299 --> 02:23:30.345]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[02:23:30.345 --> 02:23:32.266]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[02:23:44.996 --> 02:23:45.637]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[02:23:51.906 --> 02:23:55.768]  Alright, this is just absolutely crazy.
[02:24:17.995 --> 02:24:20.518]  Right now, you've got California.
[02:24:20.518 --> 02:24:24.203]  You've got a bill on the table that would make California a sanctuary city.
[02:24:24.203 --> 02:24:30.031]  Really, that's California saying they want to succeed from the Union, but they're dead broke, so they can't do it.
[02:24:30.031 --> 02:24:33.716]  They can't actually be independent because they're a bunch of communists, and they're all in debt.
[02:24:34.904 --> 02:24:36.645]  And their infrastructure is failing.
[02:24:36.645 --> 02:24:41.207]  So they just kind of skirt that and they virtue signal and say, we're a sanctuary city.
[02:24:41.207 --> 02:24:42.268]  Yes.
[02:24:42.268 --> 02:24:44.849]  Oh, well, would you actually like to succeed from the Union California?
[02:24:44.849 --> 02:24:46.690]  Well, no, we can't afford that.
[02:24:46.690 --> 02:24:47.991]  See, we can't do that.
[02:24:47.991 --> 02:24:51.533]  We're just going to be a sanctuary city and we're going to put Americans second.
[02:24:51.533 --> 02:24:52.994]  So you've got that going on.
[02:24:52.994 --> 02:24:56.376]  You've got Nancy Pelosi's press conference gets interrupted.
[02:24:57.469 --> 02:25:00.692]  Apparently by DREAMers or DACA recipients.
[02:25:00.692 --> 02:25:03.074]  Immigration activists protesting Pelosi news conference.
[02:25:03.074 --> 02:25:05.276]  So, not really sure what the deal with that is.
[02:25:05.276 --> 02:25:07.318]  Again, these people on the left are completely out of their minds.
[02:25:07.318 --> 02:25:08.580]  They don't know what's going on.
[02:25:08.580 --> 02:25:10.341]  They can't even barely tie their shoes.
[02:25:10.341 --> 02:25:12.723]  Here's the latest from Drudge.
[02:25:12.723 --> 02:25:14.365]  News Battle Royale.
[02:25:14.365 --> 02:25:15.826]  Hannity to take on Maddow.
[02:25:15.826 --> 02:25:20.491]  So Hannity is now changing time slots to go head-to-head with Rachel Maddow.
[02:25:20.491 --> 02:25:21.452]  That should be interesting.
[02:25:22.751 --> 02:25:25.013]  Somehow Maddow gets ratings.
[02:25:25.013 --> 02:25:26.814]  I mean, I guess it's like a cartoon character.
[02:25:26.814 --> 02:25:28.635]  I mean, cartoons rate kind of well.
[02:25:28.635 --> 02:25:31.878]  Republicans near votes to replace Obamacare.
[02:25:31.878 --> 02:25:33.819]  We'll see if there's anything to that.
[02:25:33.819 --> 02:25:39.383]  White House officials fear colleagues wearing wires for Mueller.
[02:25:39.383 --> 02:25:40.664]  All that and more on Drudge.
[02:25:40.664 --> 02:25:45.027]  Of course, we got breaking news at newswars.com and infowars.com.
[02:25:45.027 --> 02:25:48.129]  You want signs of liberal insanity?
[02:25:48.129 --> 02:25:51.051]  Dallas school district wang renaming schools.
[02:25:52.054 --> 02:25:56.718]  Instead of after Franklin, Jefferson, and Madison.
[02:25:56.718 --> 02:25:58.859]  So you can't, so they're just going to rename everything now.
[02:25:58.859 --> 02:26:01.461]  I guess they're going to rename everything named after the rebels.
[02:26:01.461 --> 02:26:03.223]  You can't have a team named after the Indians.
[02:26:03.223 --> 02:26:04.644]  You can't have the Redskins.
[02:26:04.644 --> 02:26:07.426]  Even though nobody cares except white liberals.
[02:26:07.426 --> 02:26:11.949]  So literally the people that aren't even victimized by this are the only ones that care.
[02:26:11.949 --> 02:26:16.613]  Yale swaps out freshmen and upperclassmen with gender neutral terms.
[02:26:16.613 --> 02:26:17.273]  Well, that'll be nice.
[02:26:17.273 --> 02:26:19.455]  I mean, you know, we might as well confuse.
[02:26:19.455 --> 02:26:20.716]  We should confuse the students.
[02:26:20.936 --> 02:26:22.579]  You know, let's get them really confused.
[02:26:22.579 --> 02:26:24.823]  Chicago, you know, 500 homicide.
[02:26:24.823 --> 02:26:27.648]  That's from a few months ago, so it's probably up more than that.
[02:26:27.648 --> 02:26:28.169]  It's just again.
[02:26:29.284 --> 02:26:31.025]  All these people protest white supremacy.
[02:26:31.025 --> 02:26:34.827]  They don't protest any of the black-on-black crimes that happened in Chicago.
[02:26:34.827 --> 02:26:37.529]  Washington Post writer says Trump is literally killing him.
[02:26:37.529 --> 02:26:37.969]  Okay.
[02:26:37.969 --> 02:26:40.191]  Dana Milbank has completely gone insane.
[02:26:40.191 --> 02:26:41.952]  Belongs in a mental institution.
[02:26:41.952 --> 02:26:46.195]  And feminists protest a Muslim event and then get beaten to a bloody pulp.
[02:26:46.195 --> 02:26:48.676]  Linda Sarsour nowhere to be found.
[02:26:48.676 --> 02:26:50.117]  Let's go back out to the phone lines.
[02:26:50.117 --> 02:26:52.298]  Let's go to James in Illinois.
[02:26:52.298 --> 02:26:52.979]  Go ahead, James.
[02:26:54.295 --> 02:26:56.437]  Greetings from Plymouth Country, Ellen.
[02:26:56.437 --> 02:27:00.360]  I definitely want to say that I love the show, and I appreciate everything you guys do.
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:02.643]  But let me get to the nittiest of the gritties.
[02:27:02.643 --> 02:27:13.853]  I think the ultimate thing that the shambling abomination of an awards show showed us last night is that being praised by people like that is really like an insult.
[02:27:13.853 --> 02:27:19.698]  And when we voted in Trump, we didn't vote in a god emperor that was going to come and decapitate the dragon.
[02:27:20.242 --> 02:27:24.984]  We voted in someone who is going to be a strong actor, because he was a strong actor.
[02:27:24.984 --> 02:27:26.584]  He's playing a role.
[02:27:26.584 --> 02:27:32.007]  He's letting everybody look at him, shine nothing but a light on all the corruption around him.
[02:27:32.007 --> 02:27:37.349]  How many names do we now know to not trust because of who he's associated with and then distanced himself from?
[02:27:37.349 --> 02:27:43.651]  Yeah, I would have never known that Sean Spicer was kind of a yellow belly, but it seems like he kind of is.
[02:27:44.318 --> 02:27:57.587]  So the ultimate thing that I think we can derive from it is that while he's there doing what we did, being where he wants to be and where we put him, we need to be all up in the ass of the 2018 elections.
[02:27:57.587 --> 02:28:00.389]  Because that is where actual momentum can be gained.
[02:28:00.389 --> 02:28:04.572]  I'm not sure if I agree with your phrasing, but I agree with the idea.
[02:28:04.572 --> 02:28:06.733]  I'm excited about these midterms.
[02:28:06.733 --> 02:28:08.814]  In a way, I haven't been in a long time.
[02:28:08.814 --> 02:28:12.297]  I think people like that... Yeah, it's just like the election!
[02:28:12.297 --> 02:28:12.477]  Yeah.
[02:28:12.918 --> 02:28:15.100]  Dr. Shiva going up against Pocahontas.
[02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:20.224]  All the meme magic that helps Trump in 2016 needs to be reinvested.
[02:28:20.224 --> 02:28:28.730]  Man, I'm telling you James, if we get Elizabeth Warren out, if we get Nancy Pelosi, well Pelosi I guess, she'll be back.
[02:28:28.730 --> 02:28:33.974]  If we get Maxine Waters out, Debbie Wasserman Schultz out, I mean these are the true swamp creatures.
[02:28:34.995 --> 02:28:37.077]  These are the true people that hate America.
[02:28:37.077 --> 02:28:39.539]  Elizabeth Warren, a total phony!
[02:28:39.539 --> 02:28:41.020]  A total fraud!
[02:28:41.020 --> 02:28:45.904]  A piece of political trash that belongs in the incinerator!
[02:28:45.904 --> 02:28:46.745]  I completely agree.
[02:28:47.290 --> 02:28:57.464]  My final statement is that as Cassini winds its way through the cosmos back home, it shows us that draining the swamp isn't about Trump alone going and taking things out.
[02:28:57.464 --> 02:29:04.974]  It's about him sinking into the swamp and showing it to us, like Cassini or any space probe going through a vaporious atmosphere of Jupiter.
[02:29:05.948 --> 02:29:08.989]  That's what we need to remember, and that's where we need to put our energy.
[02:29:08.989 --> 02:29:10.170]  It's the Trump test.
[02:29:10.170 --> 02:29:11.190]  No, you're 100% right.
[02:29:11.190 --> 02:29:12.771]  It's the Trump test.
[02:29:12.771 --> 02:29:17.813]  And just by existing, Trump has forced the deep state to show itself.
[02:29:17.813 --> 02:29:21.475]  Trump has forced the anti-American politicians to show their face.
[02:29:21.475 --> 02:29:23.976]  Trump has forced Hollywood to show its true nature.
[02:29:23.976 --> 02:29:24.776]  Absolutely.
[02:29:24.776 --> 02:29:26.677]  And we should thank President Trump for that.
[02:29:26.677 --> 02:29:28.118]  He is an American president.
[02:29:28.118 --> 02:29:29.278]  Don't go anywhere, folks.
[02:29:29.278 --> 02:29:30.499]  Alex Jones is on the other side.
[02:29:40.051 --> 02:29:43.982]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:43.982 --> 02:29:46.650]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:51.664 --> 02:29:53.785]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[02:29:53.785 --> 02:29:56.086]  Today I want to talk to you about guns.
[02:29:56.086 --> 02:29:57.146]  Why we have them.
[02:29:57.146 --> 02:30:00.527]  Why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have them.
[02:30:00.527 --> 02:30:06.029]  And why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against it in the press.
[02:30:06.029 --> 02:30:12.952]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered more essential than the First Amendment.
[02:30:13.072 --> 02:30:23.807]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the redcoats.
[02:30:23.807 --> 02:30:27.472]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[02:30:29.335 --> 02:30:36.499]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[02:30:36.499 --> 02:30:39.161]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[02:30:39.161 --> 02:30:42.002]  It doesn't recognize color, or class, or wealth.
[02:30:42.002 --> 02:30:48.606]  It protects not just the rights of actors, or editors, or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[02:30:48.606 --> 02:30:51.108]  This is a small excerpt from Tralton Heston.
[02:30:51.528 --> 02:30:53.408]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:30:53.408 --> 02:30:55.429]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:30:55.429 --> 02:30:58.329]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:30:58.329 --> 02:31:04.391]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:31:04.391 --> 02:31:13.592]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[02:31:13.592 --> 02:31:16.873]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers,
[02:31:17.113 --> 02:31:21.116]  Your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:31:21.116 --> 02:31:29.142]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:31:29.142 --> 02:31:30.223]  The general public doesn't.
[02:31:31.327 --> 02:31:35.271]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:35.271 --> 02:31:38.854]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:31:38.854 --> 02:31:45.559]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:31:45.559 --> 02:31:49.723]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:31:51.849 --> 02:31:57.272]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:31:57.272 --> 02:32:00.114]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:32:00.114 --> 02:32:02.095]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:32:02.095 --> 02:32:07.117]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[02:32:07.117 --> 02:32:09.219]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:32:09.219 --> 02:32:10.499]  In fact, it's certified.
[02:32:10.499 --> 02:32:15.622]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:32:15.622 --> 02:32:18.964]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[02:32:19.124 --> 02:32:22.486]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:32:22.486 --> 02:32:25.469]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:32:25.469 --> 02:32:29.171]  It's loaded with good halogen iodides of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:32:29.171 --> 02:32:36.096]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:32:36.096 --> 02:32:43.602]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[02:32:43.602 --> 02:32:46.464]  Learn more about InfoWars Life Super Blue Toothpaste.
[02:32:46.764 --> 02:32:51.357]  At Infowarslife.com and support the InfoWar while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[02:33:09.625 --> 02:33:11.306]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:11.306 --> 02:33:12.968]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:12.968 --> 02:33:19.673]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:19.673 --> 02:33:24.717]  Yaya Faruqa, who was arrested Saturday night.
[02:33:26.041 --> 02:33:38.994]  For reportedly being responsible for planning the bombing that would have killed untold numbers of commuters at rush hour on Friday if the improvised explosive device had properly detonated.
[02:33:38.994 --> 02:33:40.915]  And of course he was a Syrian refugee.
[02:33:43.442 --> 02:33:46.043]  Staying with another Iraqi refugee.
[02:33:46.043 --> 02:33:50.504]  And I love how he was 21 years old, the other guy is 18 years old.
[02:33:50.504 --> 02:34:00.508]  And they were calling them children a few years ago when they brought them into the UK and paid foster parents, an elderly couple, to house them and take care of them.
[02:34:01.648 --> 02:34:03.330]  This is the sick joke.
[02:34:03.330 --> 02:34:07.736]  Just like Obama said, anybody that comes across the border is legal.
[02:34:07.736 --> 02:34:12.462]  Because I'm saying they're all children and we're going to take children in that are refugees.
[02:34:12.462 --> 02:34:14.384]  It's all just a stunt.
[02:34:14.384 --> 02:34:17.928]  Just like the dreamer stuff, all of it is to pull on our heartstrings.
[02:34:17.928 --> 02:34:20.251]  Of course there's some innocent people coming in.
[02:34:21.112 --> 02:34:22.613]  Who happen to be Muslim.
[02:34:22.613 --> 02:34:25.796]  Of course there's some people that are dreamers that are great folks.
[02:34:25.796 --> 02:34:32.321]  The point is no other country in the world allows stuff like this but the United States and now Europe's doing it.
[02:34:32.321 --> 02:34:47.974]  Because the UN and Peter Sutherland admit it is about ending the sovereignty of the West and bringing in groups who will then be racially and culturally and religiously hyped up to be told that they've been treated bad by the white minority.
[02:34:48.695 --> 02:34:50.176]  That is the admitted plan.
[02:34:50.176 --> 02:34:53.237]  Turn on CNN, turn on MSNBC.
[02:34:53.237 --> 02:35:05.741]  Untold race baiting, 24-7, now, with Dallas, Texas, as Trump and I and many others warned a few months ago, we knew it was coming, is set to start pulling down statues of Thomas Jefferson
[02:35:06.744 --> 02:35:10.405]  George Washington and Benjamin Franklin.
[02:35:10.405 --> 02:35:15.706]  Again, they don't call for pulling down statues in African countries of people that have slaves.
[02:35:15.706 --> 02:35:16.046]  They don't.
[02:35:16.046 --> 02:35:16.286]  No, no.
[02:35:16.286 --> 02:35:21.147]  It's only about America and the West and about political bullying.
[02:35:21.147 --> 02:35:23.687]  And wherever Democrats get control, they do this.
[02:35:23.687 --> 02:35:29.988]  And they've got Republican cohorts that go along with it because the elite wants to distract people with the race baiting garbage.
[02:35:29.988 --> 02:35:31.488]  But let's get back to Islam.
[02:35:31.488 --> 02:35:32.549]  It's not a race.
[02:35:32.549 --> 02:35:34.469]  It's a political religion.
[02:35:35.755 --> 02:35:37.973]  And you have these individuals that are brought in.
[02:35:39.028 --> 02:35:50.216]  Who think of themselves as heroes and they hate the Brits that brought them in so much and kissed their butts so much that they tried to kill 22 people they were only able to wound.
[02:35:50.216 --> 02:35:52.498]  But I want to say this right now.
[02:35:52.498 --> 02:36:05.287]  This latest London attack and the bomb they found on a train railway and all the acid attacks and all the stabbings and all the hammered attacks that happen every day in Europe to the point that I can't even remember them all or keep track of them.
[02:36:05.287 --> 02:36:06.388]  There's four or five events a day.
[02:36:07.088 --> 02:36:09.529]  This is all a giant false flag.
[02:36:09.529 --> 02:36:11.990]  Now by false flag, there's different types of false flags.
[02:36:11.990 --> 02:36:18.553]  Purely staged, partially staged, but also when you just enable the environment to happen.
[02:36:18.553 --> 02:36:26.476]  As I've said many times, if I bred up a hundred black widows in my basement, black widow deadly spiders, they can kill you.
[02:36:26.476 --> 02:36:28.797]  And I went and dumped them in my neighbor's bed.
[02:36:28.797 --> 02:36:30.478]  Was I commanding the black widows?
[02:36:32.011 --> 02:36:39.481]  Were they following my orders or was I just bringing the black widows in and dumping them in the bed knowing what they would do?
[02:36:39.481 --> 02:36:40.763]  And that's what this is.
[02:36:40.763 --> 02:36:48.053]  But this is a staged event where they bring in the Islamist system, they attack, and then we're told we've got to give our rights up to them.
[02:36:49.054 --> 02:36:51.315]  And then somehow they'll be nice to us.
[02:36:51.315 --> 02:36:54.997]  They're trying to induct us into mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:36:54.997 --> 02:37:02.120]  If logic was around, they were bringing in these folks, you'd think, oh, they're just doing it so they stage terror attacks, then the government can take our rights.
[02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:04.101]  Then later scapegoat them and kick them out.
[02:37:04.101 --> 02:37:06.202]  But that's not the plan, and that's bad enough.
[02:37:06.202 --> 02:37:16.487]  No, they're bringing them here, knowing they can induce us into Stockholm Syndrome, to basically kiss the butt through hospitality of modern, radical, orthodox Islam.
[02:37:17.961 --> 02:37:22.864]  Like they're doing in Sweden, like they're doing in Germany, like they're doing in Canada, like they're doing in many areas of the United States.
[02:37:22.864 --> 02:37:45.156]  This is the program, taking kids to mosque, teaching kids about Muhammad, having little girls wear hijabs, having CNN on every show stick women wearing hijabs, and MSNBC that have Foot Locker and Gap, and you go to the mall and it's just every storefront shows a woman in a hijab, even though it's a tiny minority, they're getting you ready for it to be a majority.
[02:37:46.376 --> 02:37:47.297]  And that's their plan.
[02:37:47.297 --> 02:37:50.238]  Everywhere they build mosques, they admit it's an area they've conquered.
[02:37:50.238 --> 02:37:52.099]  Just like they wanted to build one on the site of 9-11.
[02:37:52.099 --> 02:37:56.261]  And I used to hear this stuff 10 years ago and roll my eyes, because it was so unbelievable.
[02:37:56.261 --> 02:37:58.262]  But now it's all confirmed to be true.
[02:37:58.262 --> 02:37:59.442]  We have all the documents.
[02:37:59.442 --> 02:38:00.763]  We have all the white papers.
[02:38:00.763 --> 02:38:04.284]  We have all the big imams saying, Europe and America are weak.
[02:38:04.284 --> 02:38:05.605]  Go there, take their women.
[02:38:05.605 --> 02:38:06.725]  They're yours now.
[02:38:06.725 --> 02:38:08.566]  Ha ha, yes, good.
[02:38:08.566 --> 02:38:09.767]  Groom their girls.
[02:38:10.854 --> 02:38:21.461]  And you sit there and you watch this, and you watch Linda Saucer with her family, hardcore terrorists, admittedly, in prison in the Middle East, and all the things she's involved in.
[02:38:21.461 --> 02:38:23.863]  They won't take her or her family in Saudi Arabia.
[02:38:23.863 --> 02:38:25.544]  They know how dangerous they are.
[02:38:25.544 --> 02:38:27.806]  They export them to us.
[02:38:27.806 --> 02:38:29.447]  Saudi Arabia won't take one refugee.
[02:38:29.827 --> 02:38:37.049]  But they sure finance the overthrow of Syria, and then all the refugees are people that they send in to take over, then they send them in to take us over.
[02:38:37.049 --> 02:38:45.192]  They breed this radical garbage in their madrasas, in their mosques, and then they export it as the weapon system outside of their countries.
[02:38:45.192 --> 02:38:45.812]  It's a fact!
[02:38:46.352 --> 02:38:50.635]  And the globalists are allied with it, and it's sickeningly conscious.
[02:38:50.635 --> 02:38:56.199]  Hollywood is so dirtbagged, so scum-filled, so anti-God, so anti-family, so anti-Christ.
[02:38:56.199 --> 02:39:03.145]  They get off on this, just like Satanists get off on molesting a child, or get off on torturing a child.
[02:39:03.145 --> 02:39:07.068]  The more obscene, the more blasphemous, the more evil, the more out of control.
[02:39:07.068 --> 02:39:12.892]  Take the West, with all its virtue, and all its openness, and all its goodness, and teach everyone to hate it.
[02:39:13.112 --> 02:39:21.739]  And lie about it, and then bring in incompatible Stone Age people that literally keep women as slaves and sell them at slave auctions and cut their genitals off.
[02:39:21.739 --> 02:39:29.766]  And to turn it around and have every major so-called liberal billionaire force-feed this garbage cynically at us when none of them take refugees in.
[02:39:29.766 --> 02:39:36.272]  And when they executed and funded Google and others the entire Arab Spring, it is the height of criminal activity.
[02:39:36.272 --> 02:39:37.713]  You have to break with the globalists.
[02:39:37.713 --> 02:39:40.895]  You have to break with the liberals and realize they are conscious criminals.
[02:39:42.036 --> 02:39:47.197]  Even low-level liberals now know that they're part of a criminal takeover and get off on it.
[02:39:47.197 --> 02:39:51.878]  You've seen the crowds everywhere we go, the hatefulness, their children cussing and screaming.
[02:39:51.878 --> 02:39:53.359]  They even fight with each other.
[02:39:53.359 --> 02:40:07.982]  They're this frothing trash that don't even work, who just live here and feed off everything, and then see the obscenity of Orthodox Islam being brought in in all its horrors and its acid attacks and its enslavement as a sign of the impending ugliness that they wish to spread.
[02:40:09.278 --> 02:40:10.018]  It's time to get angry.
[02:40:10.018 --> 02:40:10.899]  It's time to get focused.
[02:40:10.899 --> 02:40:15.120]  It's time to look at a story on InfoWars.com that is unbelievable.
[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:17.721]  That just absolutely makes my blood boil even more.
[02:40:17.721 --> 02:40:19.122]  This is what got me so mad.
[02:40:19.122 --> 02:40:30.106]  It's one thing to have Google, Facebook, Twitter and all these groups going and lobbying to be able to operate as monopolies and lobbying to have laws passed that they think they can censor and have immunity from censorship.
[02:40:31.269 --> 02:40:44.834]  It's one thing for them to engage in all the selective discrimination against libertarians and conservatives and patriots, but it's a whole other thing when they start working with Saudi Arabia and Pakistan and Iran.
[02:40:44.834 --> 02:40:45.634]  You can look this up.
[02:40:45.634 --> 02:40:47.114]  The stories are on Infowars.com.
[02:40:47.114 --> 02:40:48.295]  Mainstream news.
[02:40:48.295 --> 02:40:49.575]  Links to it.
[02:40:49.575 --> 02:40:56.378]  Proudly reporting people for blasphemy, saying, you know, I'm an atheist and, you know, say we live in a Muslim country or whatever.
[02:40:56.378 --> 02:40:59.419]  They come and kill you and Google, Facebook and Twitter.
[02:41:00.559 --> 02:41:12.908]  Are working with them to do it and working with China to get entry into China and now they're helping report mainline free social network sites.
[02:41:12.908 --> 02:41:21.054]  They are now openly coming in and saying they are going to censor any alternative sites.
[02:41:21.054 --> 02:41:23.576]  So it's one thing to say, oh, it's our site, we own it.
[02:41:23.576 --> 02:41:28.860]  So you can't be on here, even though they've always said they're a utility and they operate for the public and they discriminate.
[02:41:29.720 --> 02:41:33.161]  Still, you could argue that in some weird world.
[02:41:33.161 --> 02:41:35.282]  You cannot argue what they're doing now.
[02:41:35.282 --> 02:41:37.443]  The story's on Infowars.com.
[02:41:37.443 --> 02:41:42.285]  Google tech giants threaten to shut down free speech social site.
[02:41:42.285 --> 02:41:47.347]  So it's not enough that they're running oligopolies and monopolies and combines and trust.
[02:41:47.347 --> 02:41:49.328]  It's not enough that they're violating the public trust.
[02:41:49.808 --> 02:41:54.893]  No, now they want the tech site, the social media site based in Austin, Texas.
[02:41:54.893 --> 02:41:55.994]  I'm going to get this guy in tomorrow.
[02:41:55.994 --> 02:41:57.115]  He's been on before.
[02:41:57.115 --> 02:42:02.280]  They're trying to get it shut down in countries like Australia and the UK and other areas.
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:10.107]  And they want it shut down here as well because they have free speech and let people say racist things and do racist things.
[02:42:10.107 --> 02:42:12.149]  They also let folks counter them and say they're wrong.
[02:42:12.449 --> 02:42:14.511]  Because that's what America is, remember?
[02:42:14.511 --> 02:42:15.933]  That's what the West was.
[02:42:15.933 --> 02:42:25.224]  You may not like somebody's speech, but you stand up for their speech, because if they lose their speech, you're going to lose your speech, just like we're now seeing happening.
[02:42:25.224 --> 02:42:30.810]  To Jamie White article on Infowars.com, Google tech giants threaten to shut down free speech social site.
[02:42:30.810 --> 02:42:32.972]  Google has monopoly on flow of information.
[02:42:34.156 --> 02:42:42.063]  Search engine giant Google and other tech platforms have threatened to shut down free speech social media site Gab in the name of fighting hate speech.
[02:42:42.063 --> 02:42:50.931]  Gab, a social media platform known as the Free Speech Oasis, was just recently ordered to transfer all their Australian domain elsewhere or face shutdown.
[02:42:50.931 --> 02:42:56.255]  Gab's domain register is given five days to transfer the domain or they will seize it.
[02:42:56.255 --> 02:42:58.878]  The free and open web is in danger, the website tweeted.
[02:42:59.498 --> 02:43:08.685]  Asia Registry is poised to shut down the pro-First Amendment website because it claims Gab violates Australian, federal, and state anti-discrimination laws.
[02:43:08.685 --> 02:43:11.207]  And see, Google and all them have worked to get these laws passed.
[02:43:11.207 --> 02:43:12.488]  That's what they get into.
[02:43:12.488 --> 02:43:16.972]  Which prohibit public vilification on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic origin.
[02:43:16.972 --> 02:43:17.712]  So the Nazis...
[02:43:18.713 --> 02:43:21.055]  Articulture, or an origin, can't criticize them.
[02:43:21.055 --> 02:43:22.456]  No, see, it's all selective.
[02:43:22.456 --> 02:43:25.459]  And accuses the website of being discriminatory and hateful.
[02:43:25.459 --> 02:43:35.868]  Google has already booted Gab off the Google Bay store, also citing violations of their hate speech policies, which has promoted Gab to sue the tech giant for violating antitrust laws.
[02:43:35.868 --> 02:43:37.729]  Oh, I definitely want to get them on.
[02:43:37.729 --> 02:43:38.450]  This is serious.
[02:43:38.450 --> 02:43:43.975]  Google is the biggest threat to the free flow of information, Gab chief executive Andrew Torba said in a statement.
[02:43:44.375 --> 02:43:47.077]  And so it just goes on and on, what they're doing.
[02:43:47.077 --> 02:43:48.978]  They are deplatforming everybody.
[02:43:48.978 --> 02:44:02.108]  And all these mainline conservatives that go along with it and think they're part of the structure, all these people that, you know, sit there and side with this because they think it'll get them boosted with the globalists, kind of like Glenn Beck has done, you're idiots.
[02:44:02.108 --> 02:44:04.430]  They'll eat you last, fools.
[02:44:04.430 --> 02:44:07.352]  They'll throw you overboard for sure, though, for lowering the drawbridge.
[02:44:08.012 --> 02:44:10.574]  Now I'm going to go back to Owen Schroer and his transmission.
[02:44:10.574 --> 02:44:11.955]  I'll be back live at the studio tomorrow.
[02:44:11.955 --> 02:44:13.296]  But this is serious.
[02:44:13.296 --> 02:44:17.278]  That's why you've got to hand-share InfoWars.com articles.
[02:44:17.278 --> 02:44:20.200]  You've got to hand-share the videos through your own email.
[02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:23.703]  We've got to go back to visiting main websites, not just these big giants.
[02:44:23.703 --> 02:44:27.225]  We've got to realize that they're shutting things down because we're beginning to win.
[02:44:28.866 --> 02:44:47.075]  Absolutely, just as important as that, visit InfoWarsTore.com and realize voting with your dollars, voting to support the good guys, shopping with the good guys, is changing the world and is absolutely freaking the globalists out and absolutely putting them into fits because they're losing culturally
[02:44:47.355 --> 02:44:51.859]  But this is their counter-offensive, so we've got to beat them financially as well.
[02:44:51.859 --> 02:44:53.621]  Big sales are about to end.
[02:44:53.621 --> 02:44:55.322]  I've got to end the special on the swearable food.
[02:44:55.322 --> 02:44:56.584]  It was supposed to end this weekend.
[02:44:56.584 --> 02:44:57.585]  One more day.
[02:44:57.585 --> 02:45:01.768]  Promo code 50% off on the high-quality swearable food with promo code READY.
[02:45:03.089 --> 02:45:04.710]  We are ending again.
[02:45:04.710 --> 02:45:09.272]  I had to take off for some family stuff today, so I'm only partially working from home.
[02:45:09.272 --> 02:45:14.914]  But there's a bunch of specials that were supposed to end today, but I was supposed to come in Sunday and come up with the new specials.
[02:45:14.914 --> 02:45:18.195]  And I did come in on Sunday, but I got busy shooting other special reports.
[02:45:18.195 --> 02:45:26.378]  So the reason a bunch of specials are still on today is because I haven't come out with the new specials that will, I guess, now launch tomorrow or Wednesday.
[02:45:26.878 --> 02:45:28.699]  So, a lot of big specials right now.
[02:45:28.699 --> 02:45:30.139]  50% off on Caveman.
[02:45:30.139 --> 02:45:31.019]  Never done that before.
[02:45:31.019 --> 02:45:33.080]  40% off on Knockout.
[02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:36.461]  And just a bunch of other specials right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:45:36.461 --> 02:45:39.502]  But whatever you do, get a CNN is Fake News t-shirt.
[02:45:39.502 --> 02:45:41.523]  InfoWars.com is real news on the back.
[02:45:43.063 --> 02:45:45.985]  Just take action and know this is one hell of a fight.
[02:45:45.985 --> 02:45:50.306]  These are culture dominators that want to run your life, run your children's life.
[02:45:50.306 --> 02:45:55.928]  If they're able to shut us down, or curtail us, or gag us, they're going to come after you next.
[02:45:55.928 --> 02:45:57.469]  That's what this is all about.
[02:45:57.469 --> 02:46:01.610]  They don't want you to have a voice, because they want to totally dominate and control you.
[02:46:01.610 --> 02:46:02.891]  And I know you're not going to give in.
[02:46:02.891 --> 02:46:04.471]  I know you're not going to roll over.
[02:46:04.471 --> 02:46:05.712]  This is the animating fight.
[02:46:05.712 --> 02:46:07.793]  It's a fight for our lives, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:07.793 --> 02:46:10.894]  Now back to Owen Schroer and TheInfoWars.com News Studios.
[02:46:11.374 --> 02:46:12.334]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:46:12.334 --> 02:46:16.175]  And Alex, again, will be back tomorrow to host the Alex Jones Show.
[02:46:16.175 --> 02:46:19.416]  Let's cut through a bunch of news right now before this break.
[02:46:19.416 --> 02:46:21.777]  Border security is tougher than ever.
[02:46:21.777 --> 02:46:24.758]  DHS report finds sneaking across the U.S.
[02:46:24.758 --> 02:46:27.539]  border from Mexico is tougher than ever before, and U.S.
[02:46:27.539 --> 02:46:30.920]  agents are catching or stopping the majority of those who attempt to do so.
[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:34.442]  So again, this is why I've never been a big proponent of the wall.
[02:46:34.442 --> 02:46:43.448]  Not saying a wall doesn't help, but we can do this just by boots on the ground and by more than anything, actually following the law!
[02:46:43.448 --> 02:46:45.049]  That's what we need to do first.
[02:46:45.049 --> 02:46:49.532]  Follow the law and arrest people who illegally cross the border.
[02:46:49.532 --> 02:46:51.914]  Don't just let them come in with free handouts.
[02:46:51.914 --> 02:46:52.975]  That's what we've been doing.
[02:46:52.975 --> 02:46:59.019]  We get a president in there that follows the law, allows ICE and DHS to do their job, and then what do you know?
[02:46:59.019 --> 02:47:01.200]  The Washington Compost has to report
[02:47:02.100 --> 02:47:06.962]  Border security tougher than ever, according to DHS.
[02:47:06.962 --> 02:47:08.863]  Of course, again, the wall doesn't hurt.
[02:47:08.863 --> 02:47:11.824]  Hungary builds a wall, cuts illegal immigration by 99%.
[02:47:11.824 --> 02:47:18.506]  That's right, that's why liberals build walls outside their huge mansions.
[02:47:18.506 --> 02:47:22.848]  That's why Obama has a wall, to keep the riffraff out.
[02:47:23.899 --> 02:47:30.842]  The State Department considers closing embassy in Cuba after diplomats suffer mystery illness.
[02:47:30.842 --> 02:47:38.445]  So Tillerson is considering to close an embassy in Havana where a bunch of diplomats mysteriously got sick.
[02:47:38.445 --> 02:47:39.126]  At least 21 Americans.
[02:47:41.049 --> 02:47:45.251]  Here's some ongoing news about the world war that's building.
[02:47:45.251 --> 02:47:45.711]  U.S.
[02:47:45.711 --> 02:47:52.935]  B-1B supersonic bombers conduct joint drill with South Korea as a warning to Pyongyang.
[02:47:52.935 --> 02:47:55.036]  So Russia's doing drills.
[02:47:55.036 --> 02:47:56.977]  USA's doing drills.
[02:47:56.977 --> 02:47:59.438]  North Korea's doing drills.
[02:47:59.438 --> 02:48:01.559]  Everyone's doing drills.
[02:48:01.559 --> 02:48:06.301]  North Korea's nuclear test could spark a volcanic eruption.
[02:48:06.301 --> 02:48:07.422]  You know, that's another thing.
[02:48:09.249 --> 02:48:19.594]  As I'm about to cover another climate change story, all these liberals that want to complain about climate change all day long, do they ever bring up nuclear bomb testing?
[02:48:19.594 --> 02:48:28.178]  There have been like thousands of nuclear bombs detonated across the entire planet over the last 30 years.
[02:48:28.178 --> 02:48:30.760]  Complete radio silence!
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:35.442]  They don't complain once about Kim Jong-un testing a hydrogen bomb.
[02:48:35.862 --> 02:48:41.125]  They don't complain once about Kim Jong-un completely testing nuclear bombs all the time.
[02:48:41.125 --> 02:48:42.366]  America does it too.
[02:48:42.366 --> 02:48:43.046]  Everyone does it.
[02:48:43.046 --> 02:48:44.667]  They all test nuclear bombs.
[02:48:44.667 --> 02:48:46.288]  Nobody complains.
[02:48:46.288 --> 02:48:48.609]  Nobody complains about the nuclear bomb testing.
[02:48:48.609 --> 02:48:50.531]  Nobody complains about the geoengineering.
[02:48:50.531 --> 02:48:52.672]  It's how dare you drive a car?
[02:48:52.672 --> 02:48:54.473]  How dare you have electricity?
[02:48:54.473 --> 02:48:57.675]  How dare you be such a glutton and want to have air conditioning?
[02:48:58.760 --> 02:49:00.381]  No, that's to bring you down.
[02:49:00.381 --> 02:49:02.122]  That's to handicap you.
[02:49:02.122 --> 02:49:04.223]  To keep you from having a destiny.
[02:49:04.223 --> 02:49:06.124]  To keep you from having a future.
[02:49:06.124 --> 02:49:07.405]  To keep you from being free.
[02:49:07.405 --> 02:49:09.086]  To oppress you.
[02:49:09.086 --> 02:49:14.209]  So all the liberals out there that say climate change, climate change, we need to do something about climate change.
[02:49:14.209 --> 02:49:18.751]  Go stop Kim Jong-un from testing a nuclear bomb every week.
[02:49:18.751 --> 02:49:19.812]  And then come talk to me.
[02:49:20.652 --> 02:49:31.000]  And so then Ryan Maui writes this story for Wall Street Journal basically saying, hey, all of you freaking out about hurricanes and climate change, maybe you should get your facts right.
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.862]  And he's basically saying all the hype doesn't help.
[02:49:33.862 --> 02:49:40.847]  You're just building a straw man, essentially, without actually pointing to any data, any evidence.
[02:49:40.847 --> 02:49:46.071]  Well, that's because the data and the evidence points to not global warming.
[02:49:46.071 --> 02:49:48.894]  That's why they had to change it from global warming to climate change.
[02:49:49.773 --> 02:49:56.605]  Meanwhile, Hurricane Irma latest updates indicates possible similar path as Irma.
[02:49:56.605 --> 02:49:58.588]  This is Hurricane Maria.
[02:49:58.588 --> 02:50:01.433]  Hurricane Marina, uh, Maria, excuse me.
[02:50:02.577 --> 02:50:04.418]  But are we kind of like hurricaned out?
[02:50:04.418 --> 02:50:06.239]  Is anyone really going to cover this like we have been?
[02:50:06.239 --> 02:50:07.920]  Are we like hurricaned out now?
[02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:13.062]  Second man arrested over London bombing is a Syrian refugee.
[02:50:13.062 --> 02:50:17.964]  So the tube bomb, the flame bomb that burned and scolded and killed people.
[02:50:17.964 --> 02:50:22.527]  Second man arrested is a Syrian refugee.
[02:50:22.527 --> 02:50:27.189]  But we should continue to let Syrian refugees come here because they are loving.
[02:50:28.649 --> 02:50:30.130]  The Equifax hack.
[02:50:30.130 --> 02:50:33.951]  Hackers have the credit information of 143 million Americans.
[02:50:33.951 --> 02:50:35.531]  I see stories like this every day.
[02:50:35.531 --> 02:50:37.772]  Everyone's getting hacked, all this information.
[02:50:37.772 --> 02:50:38.372]  It's crazy.
[02:50:38.372 --> 02:50:38.592]  U.S.
[02:50:38.592 --> 02:50:42.054]  sanctions backfire, China opens $10 billion credit line for Iran.
[02:50:42.054 --> 02:50:43.154]  Thanks, Democrats!
[02:50:43.154 --> 02:50:46.175]  You started a trade war, and now it's gonna bite us in the ass!

[02:52:57.374 --> 02:52:58.956]  But the symptoms are there.

[02:53:58.165 --> 02:54:03.048]  Well, of course, Alex Jones was covering this years ago.
[02:54:03.048 --> 02:54:08.191]  Scientists successfully edit human embryos to remove disease.
[02:54:08.191 --> 02:54:23.219]  He was the one that covered human embryo hybrids, you know, being livers and organs being grown in cows and pigs, human hybrids and all this type of stuff, spider goats, etc, etc.
[02:54:24.741 --> 02:54:30.944]  But now it's just, you know, just trendy, you know, scientists editing human embryos to remove disease.
[02:54:30.944 --> 02:54:31.244]  See?
[02:54:31.244 --> 02:54:31.804]  That's all it is.
[02:54:31.804 --> 02:54:32.865]  We're just removing disease.
[02:54:32.865 --> 02:54:35.066]  It's good!
[02:54:35.066 --> 02:54:42.930]  And because, you know, we're not one nation under God anymore, you know, a lot of people are atheists now, you don't have the debate.
[02:54:43.985 --> 02:54:46.966]  Should we be messing with God's creation?
[02:54:46.966 --> 02:54:49.986]  Should we be messing with the organic life on this planet?
[02:54:49.986 --> 02:54:52.507]  Should we be messing with our own biology?
[02:54:52.507 --> 02:54:55.648]  Will there be any negative side effects?
[02:54:55.648 --> 02:55:00.169]  Well, no, we don't talk about that because it's trendy and we're scientists, see?
[02:55:00.169 --> 02:55:04.189]  We're scientists and we're going to end disease in human embryos.
[02:55:04.189 --> 02:55:06.610]  Yeah, I'm sure there'll be no side effects at all.
[02:55:06.610 --> 02:55:10.951]  I'm sure that those labs will never have any, you know, sort of quarantine ever.
[02:55:12.059 --> 02:55:13.320]  Let's go back to your callers.
[02:55:13.320 --> 02:55:16.943]  We're going to have Jack Posobiec in the fourth hour, running the fourth hour here.
[02:55:16.943 --> 02:55:19.366]  Let's go to Margaret in Texas.
[02:55:19.366 --> 02:55:22.568]  Go ahead, Margaret.
[02:55:22.568 --> 02:55:35.040]  Hi, I recently had a conversation with a woman whose uncle was former Senator Bob Bennett of Utah, and they were very, very close.
[02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:38.523]  And Bob Bennett, Senator Bob Bennett told her
[02:55:39.522 --> 02:55:50.307]  That all the senators and congresspeople were already hunkered in well before the terrorists struck on 9-11 to hit the world.
[02:55:50.307 --> 02:55:53.969]  Well yeah, wasn't it Condoleezza Rice who was told not to fly on 9-11 too?
[02:55:53.969 --> 02:55:58.651]  There were a bunch of people that were told, you know, don't fly on this day.
[02:55:58.651 --> 02:56:04.294]  We need to have a citizen's grand jury and rein in all those senators under oath
[02:56:04.887 --> 02:56:10.528]  And ask them, where were you hours before the terrorist attack?
[02:56:10.528 --> 02:56:12.849]  And what did you know?
[02:56:12.849 --> 02:56:18.790]  Because you start connecting the dots, Owen.
[02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:20.950]  No, I mean, I completely understand what you're saying.
[02:56:20.950 --> 02:56:22.551]  I mean.
[02:56:22.551 --> 02:56:25.351]  I mean, here we've got the terrorist attacks.
[02:56:25.351 --> 02:56:30.052]  Then we've got the black Muslim, hail Hussein Obama.
[02:56:30.052 --> 02:56:32.993]  And now we've got all this racial division.
[02:56:32.993 --> 02:56:33.853]  And if you Google
[02:56:34.586 --> 02:56:36.770]  White woman with a baby?
[02:56:36.770 --> 02:56:40.335]  You'll get the most bizarre searches.
[02:56:41.189 --> 02:56:43.650]  Oh yeah, people are reporting on these Google searches.
[02:56:43.650 --> 02:56:47.310]  You search American inventors, they don't show any white people.
[02:56:47.310 --> 02:56:49.591]  You search American family, they don't show any white people.
[02:56:49.591 --> 02:56:54.972]  Then you do the same search on Bing, or on DuckDuckGo, or on Yahoo, or some other search.
[02:56:54.972 --> 02:57:02.554]  It shows you the real results, not censored by Google, so Google can try to paint the optics of America that are totally inaccurate.
[02:57:02.554 --> 02:57:04.674]  You know, and Margaret brings up 9-11.
[02:57:04.674 --> 02:57:08.515]  I mean, I don't know what we do, folks.
[02:57:09.480 --> 02:57:10.500]  I mean, you think about it.
[02:57:10.500 --> 02:57:11.781]  They got away with 9-11.
[02:57:11.781 --> 02:57:13.641]  Whatever the truth is, we still don't know.
[02:57:13.641 --> 02:57:15.061]  They still have classified papers.
[02:57:15.061 --> 02:57:18.522]  They still have the 21 pages that are classified.
[02:57:18.522 --> 02:57:26.724]  What we do know is that, you know, they basically made us go to war with Afghanistan and Iraq, even though all of the hijackers came from Saudi Arabia.
[02:57:26.724 --> 02:57:29.585]  I mean, the list of nonsense just goes on and on.
[02:57:29.585 --> 02:57:31.525]  So I don't know what the answer is.
[02:57:31.525 --> 02:57:33.466]  I mean, we're going to continue to harp on the truth.
[02:57:33.466 --> 02:57:34.846]  We're going to continue to fight for 9-11 truth.
[02:57:36.684 --> 02:57:47.307]  And I think most people are starting to come around now, as slowly more and more kind of leaks out, and it just more and more doesn't make sense here, almost 20 years later, the way we've responded.
[02:57:47.307 --> 02:57:49.208]  And it just goes on and on.
[02:57:49.208 --> 02:57:54.749]  So I don't know if this is just a time bomb of 9-11 truth, or if there's really anything we can do at this point.
[02:57:54.749 --> 02:57:55.970]  Thank you so much for the call, Margaret.
[02:57:55.970 --> 02:57:57.990]  Let's go to Michael in Florida.
[02:57:57.990 --> 02:58:02.872]  Go ahead, Michael.
[02:58:02.872 --> 02:58:03.532]  What?
[02:58:03.532 --> 02:58:04.012]  What?
[02:58:04.012 --> 02:58:04.172]  Yeah.
[02:58:05.962 --> 02:58:27.209]  Um, the thing is, is that about what you said about the changing of our genetics, I say, I have a feeling that that, this current drug thing that's currently going on in China, I think that's probably the beginning of a side effect of our... Alright, well I can't really understand you, I'm not sure if you're screaming into your phone like I might be if I was upset about this, but uh...
[02:58:27.629 --> 02:58:29.330]  Yeah, they're trying to change our DNA.
[02:58:29.330 --> 02:58:30.731]  They're trying to rig our genetics.
[02:58:30.731 --> 02:58:32.192]  They want to end the human species.
[02:58:32.192 --> 02:58:33.834]  Check out the Georgia Guidestones.
[02:58:33.834 --> 02:58:36.376]  That's why they force you to vaccinate your kids, folks.
[02:58:36.376 --> 02:58:37.697]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[02:58:37.697 --> 02:58:39.458]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show coming up.
[02:58:41.331 --> 02:58:57.619]  After being sold out more than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy, and told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food.
[02:58:57.839 --> 02:59:01.580]  And adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[02:59:01.580 --> 02:59:05.242]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[02:59:05.242 --> 02:59:12.224]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:59:12.224 --> 02:59:25.088]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:59:25.088 --> 02:59:26.649]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:59:26.929 --> 02:59:33.333]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[02:59:33.333 --> 02:59:38.256]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:59:38.256 --> 02:59:40.258]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:57.957 --> 03:00:07.365]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:07.365 --> 03:00:15.453]  You know, human beings are pretty unique creatures, aren't we, on this planet Earth?
[03:00:15.453 --> 03:00:16.133]  Pretty unique.
[03:00:16.133 --> 03:00:17.415]  Pretty amazing, if you think about it.
[03:00:18.630 --> 03:00:29.836]  And we've forgotten how amazing we are, we've forgotten our true destiny, we've forgotten we're made in the image of God, and so now we hate ourselves, and we don't care if we mess with our DNA.
[03:00:29.836 --> 03:00:40.422]  We don't care if we're killing our DNA, we don't care if we're killing our atmosphere, because we're obsessed with Kim Kardashian's butt.
[03:00:40.422 --> 03:00:42.023]  Great.
[03:00:42.023 --> 03:00:46.866]  And that's the ship that we've been sinking on for so long, but we're finally taking the culture back
[03:00:47.756 --> 03:01:07.591]  We're finally taking our destiny back, and the globalists are fighting with everything they have to try to keep us down, to try to keep us oppressed, to try to stunt our DNA, stunt our development, stunt our intellect, stunt everything, to literally retard the entire human race so that they can murder us all.
[03:01:07.591 --> 03:01:08.932]  That's what you gotta do.
[03:01:08.932 --> 03:01:11.915]  That's what they wanna do, and they say it's to save the planet.
[03:01:12.847 --> 03:01:14.747]  Let's go back to the line.
[03:01:14.747 --> 03:01:17.608]  Let's go to Matthew in Alabama.
[03:01:17.608 --> 03:01:18.408]  Go ahead, Matthew.
[03:01:18.408 --> 03:01:22.589]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:01:22.589 --> 03:01:24.329]  Doing good.
[03:01:24.329 --> 03:01:26.450]  Hey, so I was watching the Emmys last night.
[03:01:26.450 --> 03:01:28.330]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[03:01:28.330 --> 03:01:29.130]  Yeah, I know.
[03:01:29.130 --> 03:01:29.950]  I was watching it.
[03:01:29.950 --> 03:01:33.131]  I was almost studying the Emmys, you could say.
[03:01:33.131 --> 03:01:39.552]  And the one thing that jumped out to me was when that funny guy jumped on stage.
[03:01:40.712 --> 03:01:48.936]  I think his name is on Twitter, at Millennial underscore Matt, and he yelled, Hitler did nothing wrong.
[03:01:48.936 --> 03:02:01.862]  I thought that was really great, and it was a nice change of atmosphere, because all these people up there, all these Jewish comedians and actors,
[03:02:03.492 --> 03:02:14.680]  They've given us such a strange representation of our history, and they want to tear it all down, and I just can't help but agree with that man, Millennial Matt, on Twitter.
[03:02:14.680 --> 03:02:19.063]  I can't help but agree with him, and say Hitler did nothing wrong.
[03:02:19.063 --> 03:02:19.704]  I'm confused.
[03:02:19.704 --> 03:02:23.026]  You're saying that Adolf Hitler did nothing wrong?
[03:02:23.026 --> 03:02:26.848]  Well, that's what Millennial Matt did, the famous Twitter guy.
[03:02:26.848 --> 03:02:28.910]  I don't understand the point.
[03:02:30.509 --> 03:02:34.754]  Well, the point was, you know, I'm starting to agree with him.
[03:02:34.754 --> 03:02:36.116]  You're a holocaust denier?
[03:02:36.116 --> 03:02:39.921]  I am a holocaust denier, yes.
[03:02:39.921 --> 03:02:41.042]  Hmm.
[03:02:41.042 --> 03:02:42.745]  Okay.
[03:02:42.745 --> 03:02:46.830]  Even though there's like so much evidence that the holocaust happened, it's like absurd to deny it?
[03:02:48.482 --> 03:02:50.963]  Well, you know, the six million number is not real.
[03:02:50.963 --> 03:02:55.146]  You can argue about the six million number, but that doesn't mean the Holocaust didn't happen.
[03:02:55.146 --> 03:02:58.368]  Thank you for the call, Matthew.
[03:02:58.368 --> 03:03:00.389]  Let's go to Antoine now in California.
[03:03:00.389 --> 03:03:03.831]  Go ahead, Antoine.
[03:03:03.831 --> 03:03:08.553]  Hey, this is Antoine.
[03:03:08.553 --> 03:03:09.274]  I'm doing good.
[03:03:09.274 --> 03:03:13.196]  So the first thing I'd like to say is
[03:03:14.274 --> 03:03:39.846]  I did some reporting for InfoWars myself, and you can go to RevolverOrbiter at Twitter, or you can go to the Orbiter on YouTube, and the one with NASA in it, and I'd like to say, yeah, Donald Trump should probably get a bunch of people around him who can spook the CIA, spook the FBI, spook all those
[03:03:40.416 --> 03:03:46.397]  People who have a lot of problems with basically patriot-like things.
[03:03:46.397 --> 03:03:54.198]  I think if he can get people who will annoy these people enough when they're around him, they won't be around him too long.
[03:03:54.198 --> 03:03:55.359]  Well, you know what?
[03:03:55.359 --> 03:03:58.699]  Annoyance is a tactic of the Marxists.
[03:03:58.699 --> 03:04:00.840]  It's the tactic of the Agiprop.
[03:04:00.840 --> 03:04:07.001]  I think that Trump needs to continue to build a team of lawyers and go after these people legally.
[03:04:07.001 --> 03:04:08.621]  You know, they want to probe him to death.
[03:04:09.628 --> 03:04:11.390]  Why not probe them right back?
[03:04:11.390 --> 03:04:14.272]  Why not look into the CIA running drugs across the border?
[03:04:14.272 --> 03:04:18.977]  Why not look into the CIA and the FBI running cocaine and the drug war?
[03:04:18.977 --> 03:04:23.521]  And why not look into what the opium is doing that comes here from Afghanistan?
[03:04:23.521 --> 03:04:28.045]  I completely agree, but I think you put sharks on these people like Ty Cobb.
[03:04:28.806 --> 03:04:29.988]  You don't try to annoy them.
[03:04:29.988 --> 03:04:31.029]  You don't try to embarrass them.
[03:04:31.029 --> 03:04:32.472]  You say, you know what?
[03:04:32.472 --> 03:04:33.513]  You're a criminal.
[03:04:33.513 --> 03:04:36.357]  We're coming after you with the law, you SOB.
[03:04:36.357 --> 03:04:37.699]  That's what I think Trump should do.
[03:04:37.699 --> 03:04:40.343]  Continue to hire lawyers to attack these people right back.
[03:04:40.343 --> 03:04:41.665]  Give them a bit of their own medicine.
[03:04:41.665 --> 03:04:43.127]  We'll be right back with Jack Posobiec.
[03:04:43.127 --> 03:04:43.688]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:04:48.821 --> 03:05:02.728]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[03:05:02.728 --> 03:05:07.009]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[03:05:07.009 --> 03:05:09.571]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve?
[03:05:09.571 --> 03:05:11.711]  Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[03:05:11.711 --> 03:05:17.274]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles?
[03:05:17.654 --> 03:05:18.895]  And to profit from it.
[03:05:18.895 --> 03:05:23.637]  What kind of leverage do these people in the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[03:05:23.637 --> 03:05:27.938]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[03:05:27.938 --> 03:05:30.419]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[03:05:30.419 --> 03:05:35.421]  Adams also said, liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.

[03:09:58.815 --> 03:10:02.898]  Without further ado, I bring in Jack Posobiec.
[03:10:02.898 --> 03:10:08.442]  Jack's going to be breaking some news on Hillary Clinton funding Antifa.
[03:10:08.442 --> 03:10:11.104]  Give us a little teaser here, Jack, before we take some phone calls.
[03:10:11.104 --> 03:10:11.865]  What did you discover?
[03:10:13.044 --> 03:10:30.629]  Owen, the stuff that we've been looking up to, it's myself, Daily Caller, some great sites, Offended America, they've been going through Hillary's new dark money pack called Onward Together, and they've actually found, it looks like about $800,000 from Hillary Clinton, now in the hands of Antifa.
[03:10:31.243 --> 03:10:32.504]  Wow, $800,000!
[03:10:32.504 --> 03:10:41.832]  She could have given a dollar to each DACA recipient, you know, because she cares so much about the DACA recipients, but she just ignores that because she'd rather fund taking down America.
[03:10:41.832 --> 03:10:52.921]  So, Jack is going to be breaking all of that down in the next segment, but we've got some callers on the line here, so let's clear out the deck with Jack Posobiec here in the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:10:52.921 --> 03:10:54.782]  Let's start with Phillip in Virginia.
[03:10:54.782 --> 03:10:55.363]  Go ahead, Phillip.
[03:10:56.741 --> 03:11:05.388]  Yeah, I was just going to say, you know, I don't know that the news covered it because it wasn't a show that they wanted, but it was like a rally like they had in Charlottesville and Richmond this past weekend.
[03:11:05.388 --> 03:11:06.469]  Yep.
[03:11:06.469 --> 03:11:15.857]  And it was like all this big hype to do all week long and everybody, you know, like all getting tense in the city who's worried about them tearing the trash in, you know, Richmond up.
[03:11:15.857 --> 03:11:24.044]  And so it's like on Monument Avenue, it's like kind of the, it's like mostly million, million dollar homes, you know, along that avenue.
[03:11:25.006 --> 03:11:53.299]  It's like the elite and kind of in the rich people live there and it's basically so they were all like scared running out of town and away from houses and then it was all this soup to law and then it was like I think it was six people you know that came and they were from I think you're from Tennessee that showed up with Confederate flags you know and they didn't say nothing about hey they denounced the Klan and all this and there was about 400 protesters and it was like
[03:11:55.760 --> 03:12:00.745]  Yeah.
[03:12:00.745 --> 03:12:08.734]  And they didn't get the violence, they didn't get the violence that they can use to try to demonize Trump supporters here, or to try to make all Trump supporters white supremacists.
[03:12:08.734 --> 03:12:09.996]  Jack, you're close to that area.
[03:12:10.885 --> 03:12:18.288]  Yeah, amazing how when it's a peaceful rally, it doesn't get the same kind of coverage on the mainstream media when they don't have the violence, the fighting in the streets that they want.
[03:12:18.288 --> 03:12:21.369]  You know, we had a peaceful rally here in Washington, D.C.
[03:12:21.369 --> 03:12:24.850]  They call it the mother of all rallies last weekend for Trump.
[03:12:24.850 --> 03:12:31.532]  And without any Trump surrogates there, without the president himself, anyone else, we had about 300 people out.
[03:12:31.532 --> 03:12:32.592]  And there was no violence.
[03:12:32.592 --> 03:12:33.793]  There was no anger.
[03:12:33.793 --> 03:12:36.294]  It was people literally dancing, a diverse crowd.
[03:12:36.294 --> 03:12:40.375]  But of course, the mainstream media wouldn't cover it because it just showed Trump supporters loving their country.
[03:12:41.241 --> 03:12:54.811]  Yeah, and then another funny thing about it too is like they arrested I think seven or eight people or whatever it was and one of them was charged with possession of a stolen weapon and possession of concealing it.
[03:12:54.811 --> 03:13:00.456]  Yeah, the police actually said that they were going to have a weapons ban at that event.
[03:13:01.331 --> 03:13:06.594]  Yeah, well another one was charged in possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.
[03:13:06.594 --> 03:13:09.215]  So that tells me the IQ of these people.
[03:13:09.215 --> 03:13:14.398]  And these were people that were there to protest against Trump and against the people protecting the Confederate monuments?
[03:13:15.157 --> 03:13:18.518]  Yeah, so it's like, and then they weren't even from Richmond either, so.
[03:13:18.518 --> 03:13:19.598]  Oh, shocking.
[03:13:19.598 --> 03:13:20.678]  Oh, wow.
[03:13:20.678 --> 03:13:22.179]  Yeah, we never see that, Jack.
[03:13:22.179 --> 03:13:24.119]  We never see these protesters come in.
[03:13:24.119 --> 03:13:25.740]  No, no.
[03:13:25.740 --> 03:13:34.002]  Yeah, I actually had, when the DACA announcement was signed, I actually had the wherewithal to go down to Trump Tower, well, Trump Hotel here in D.C.
[03:13:34.682 --> 03:13:54.551]  And I sat in front of it, and I waited, and I've copied this, the pictures, I got the video, I actually saw the bus drive up to Trump DC, all of the DACA protesters file off the bus, the organizers get them all in place, completely in Spanish of course, and then the bus drives away, and then the mainstream media shows up and starts covering it.
[03:13:54.551 --> 03:13:56.552]  So it's like, yeah, here you go.
[03:13:56.552 --> 03:14:03.495]  And it's funny because, you know, we talk about these bused-in protesters, but I was like, no, I'm actually gonna go and stake it out and get the bus, and I caught it.
[03:14:03.795 --> 03:14:05.276]  Yeah, and you can do that.
[03:14:05.276 --> 03:14:08.318]  The majority of these protests, there's usually buses that show up.
[03:14:08.318 --> 03:14:09.919]  They load them on the bus.
[03:14:09.919 --> 03:14:23.027]  And as you pointed out, you're going to get into this later here in the fourth hour, how they use these PACs, you know, Soros money, Clinton Foundation money to fund these protests and to get this stuff stirred up in the streets.
[03:14:23.027 --> 03:14:28.311]  Of course, we had the Project Veritas video talking about how it was direct orders from Hillary's mouth.
[03:14:28.311 --> 03:14:29.932]  She wants Trump duck.
[03:14:29.932 --> 03:14:32.814]  And so Bob Kramer, who now doesn't have a job,
[03:14:33.354 --> 03:14:38.078]  Is the one that makes it happen, and the rest of the people- How bad- I mean, how bad was that meme, too?
[03:14:38.078 --> 03:14:39.719]  The left can't meme, Owen.
[03:14:39.719 --> 03:14:41.661]  The left can't meme.
[03:14:41.661 --> 03:14:42.862]  Trump duck.
[03:14:42.862 --> 03:14:44.123]  What- what even was that?
[03:14:44.123 --> 03:14:45.003]  Trump is a duck?
[03:14:45.003 --> 03:14:47.145]  What- cuz he- cuz he- It's Donald Duck!
[03:14:47.145 --> 03:14:48.346]  It's Donald Duck?
[03:14:48.346 --> 03:14:49.407]  I don't- I like Donald Duck.
[03:14:49.407 --> 03:14:50.307]  How is that bad?
[03:14:50.307 --> 03:14:52.249]  I like Donald Duck, yeah.
[03:14:52.249 --> 03:14:52.709]  I don't understand.
[03:14:52.709 --> 03:14:55.892]  But that's easy, because his name is Donald, so they can just be like, oh.
[03:14:56.112 --> 03:14:57.254]  Oh, his name's Donald.
[03:14:57.254 --> 03:14:59.678]  See, even there, like, you have to explain it and think about it.
[03:14:59.678 --> 03:15:01.101]  Like, okay, his name's Donald.
[03:15:01.101 --> 03:15:01.722]  No, you're not.
[03:15:01.722 --> 03:15:02.503]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:15:02.503 --> 03:15:05.808]  Jack, your problem is you can't think simply enough.
[03:15:06.977 --> 03:15:07.577]  I'm sorry.
[03:15:07.577 --> 03:15:11.658]  You need to bring your IQ down to understand these people.
[03:15:11.658 --> 03:15:13.359]  I need to come way, way, way down.
[03:15:13.359 --> 03:15:16.199]  His name's Donald and Donald Duck is Donald.
[03:15:16.199 --> 03:15:18.580]  Therefore, the left can't meme.
[03:15:18.580 --> 03:15:19.820]  Now you're getting it though.
[03:15:19.820 --> 03:15:20.560]  I see now.
[03:15:20.560 --> 03:15:24.461]  Donald, right, and because orange, right, the gill.
[03:15:24.461 --> 03:15:25.021]  I never understood.
[03:15:25.021 --> 03:15:27.382]  Why did Donald Duck wear a towel when he got out of the shower?
[03:15:27.382 --> 03:15:27.862]  I'm saying.
[03:15:27.862 --> 03:15:29.062]  I'm saying.
[03:15:29.062 --> 03:15:30.563]  I think he's got two.
[03:15:30.563 --> 03:15:32.823]  I think he was trying to hide two scoops.
[03:15:32.823 --> 03:15:34.944]  Let's go to Dennis in New York.
[03:15:34.944 --> 03:15:35.664]  Go ahead, Dennis.
[03:15:37.948 --> 03:15:38.829]  Uh, yeah, hi.
[03:15:38.829 --> 03:15:46.474]  I was calling about, um, you guys have played a clip of, uh, what's this, Stephen Colbert at the Emmys yesterday?
[03:15:46.474 --> 03:15:53.539]  The stupid joke that he made about Trump saying that, oh, the Emmys are decided by a popular vote.
[03:15:53.539 --> 03:15:56.480]  The Emmys aren't even decided by a popular vote.
[03:15:56.480 --> 03:16:02.464]  The Emmys are decided by some, like, group of whoever decides whoever's the best.
[03:16:02.464 --> 03:16:04.286]  Oh yeah, the Emmys are totally rigged.
[03:16:04.286 --> 03:16:04.746]  Absolutely.
[03:16:05.390 --> 03:16:09.593]  If the Emmys are as rigged as the DNC Primary... Maybe more.
[03:16:09.593 --> 03:16:11.315]  Possibly more, yeah.
[03:16:11.315 --> 03:16:14.017]  You just don't see people dying over the rigging of the Emmys?
[03:16:14.017 --> 03:16:15.698]  That's the only difference?
[03:16:15.698 --> 03:16:18.841]  Oh, too soon.
[03:16:18.841 --> 03:16:21.403]  Anything else, Dennis?
[03:16:21.403 --> 03:16:24.886]  A joke is supposed to be, like, halfway true for it to be funny.
[03:16:24.886 --> 03:16:27.488]  Like, it's not... Well, no, no, no, no.
[03:16:27.488 --> 03:16:28.789]  I gotta stop Dennis right there.
[03:16:28.789 --> 03:16:29.629]  Hold on.
[03:16:29.629 --> 03:16:30.970]  Hold on.
[03:16:30.970 --> 03:16:32.692]  A joke is supposed to be funny.
[03:16:34.568 --> 03:16:35.189]  That's it!
[03:16:35.189 --> 03:16:37.891]  Yeah, if you're gonna do humor, it's gotta be funny first.
[03:16:37.891 --> 03:16:38.792]  These people aren't funny!
[03:16:38.792 --> 03:16:41.074]  And this is what we were just talking about with these memes.
[03:16:41.074 --> 03:16:43.756]  They don't know how to meme because they have no sense of humor.
[03:16:43.756 --> 03:16:45.518]  Donald Trump was elected in great part.
[03:16:45.518 --> 03:16:49.842]  I bet you there are people out there who said, I'm gonna vote for Trump because he's funny.
[03:16:49.842 --> 03:16:52.004]  I'm telling you, you know there's people out there that said that.
[03:16:52.819 --> 03:17:05.069]  It's just amazing how they'll completely, just completely abandon the entire point of comedy, the entire point of entertainment, the entire point of the theater.
[03:17:05.069 --> 03:17:08.912]  We go to the theater to get away from the realities of the real world.
[03:17:08.912 --> 03:17:16.938]  We go to a comedy act to laugh and have fun, and these people have politicized everything, and they're not entertaining, and they're not funny anymore.
[03:17:16.938 --> 03:17:18.660]  Let's take one more call with Jack Posobiec.
[03:17:18.660 --> 03:17:20.521]  Let's go to Jim, also in New York.
[03:17:20.521 --> 03:17:21.122]  Go ahead, Jim.
[03:17:24.360 --> 03:17:25.080]  Hello?
[03:17:25.080 --> 03:17:25.340]  Hi!
[03:17:25.340 --> 03:17:27.621]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:17:27.621 --> 03:17:29.302]  Doing good.
[03:17:29.302 --> 03:17:36.785]  Hey, so my name is Millennial Matt and I challenge any InfoWars employee to a debate on the validity of the claims of the so-called Holocaust.
[03:17:36.785 --> 03:17:39.826]  Wow, so this is actually Millennial Matt?
[03:17:39.826 --> 03:17:41.947]  Who doesn't believe in the Holocaust?
[03:17:41.947 --> 03:17:44.488]  We have an interloper here, we have a Holocaust denier.
[03:17:44.488 --> 03:17:45.669]  So let me ask you a question.
[03:17:46.429 --> 03:17:55.894]  What are all of the images we see of Jewish people literally skin and bones, starving to death, overflowing trains, there's an entire Holocaust museum, all kinds of pictures and video.
[03:17:55.894 --> 03:17:57.335]  I've been to Auschwitz.
[03:17:57.335 --> 03:17:58.216]  Have you been to Auschwitz?
[03:17:58.216 --> 03:18:10.002]  The reason that a lot of those pictures you have skinny, emaciated bodies is because near the end of the war the Allies bombed all of their supply routes and everybody was starving.
[03:18:11.957 --> 03:18:14.218]  That's historically inaccurate.
[03:18:14.218 --> 03:18:17.300]  So your argument is that the Holocaust happened.
[03:18:17.300 --> 03:18:18.540]  Is that where I'm getting here?
[03:18:18.540 --> 03:18:22.282]  You're saying like, so we're saying that the pictures were true and you're admitting that they're true.
[03:18:22.282 --> 03:18:24.163]  So I don't really see your argument here.
[03:18:25.353 --> 03:18:32.355]  Okay, well, when you gas somebody with Zyklon B, which is impossible in the first place, they don't magically become emaciated.
[03:18:32.355 --> 03:18:35.556]  People become emaciated through disease and starvation.
[03:18:35.556 --> 03:18:36.976]  There's a reason they were starved.
[03:18:36.976 --> 03:18:39.156]  Do you want to understand why they were starved?
[03:18:39.156 --> 03:18:41.797]  Yeah, because you're malnourished, you don't have food.
[03:18:41.797 --> 03:18:45.938]  Are you an expert on gassing people, Matt?
[03:18:45.938 --> 03:18:47.999]  What are your credentials in this field?
[03:18:47.999 --> 03:18:51.640]  Do you have a degree in any of this?
[03:18:51.640 --> 03:18:52.940]  Have you gone to school for any of this?
[03:18:54.460 --> 03:18:58.783]  Again, I challenge any of you to a debate on this.
[03:18:58.783 --> 03:18:59.784]  What are you talking about?
[03:18:59.784 --> 03:19:02.986]  You're on the air right now!
[03:19:02.986 --> 03:19:04.387]  Okay, let's go.
[03:19:04.387 --> 03:19:06.989]  This six million number, it's false.
[03:19:06.989 --> 03:19:12.333]  Okay, so I asked you a simple question and now you're jumping around and you're just throwing other facts at us.
[03:19:12.333 --> 03:19:16.035]  And if you're not going to answer questions, then we can't have a real debate.
[03:19:16.035 --> 03:19:19.158]  I answered your question.
[03:19:19.158 --> 03:19:20.979]  So Jack Posovic's been to Auschwitz.
[03:19:20.979 --> 03:19:22.120]  Did Auschwitz not exist?
[03:19:23.399 --> 03:19:25.440]  Auschwitz obviously existed.
[03:19:25.440 --> 03:19:31.964]  It was an internment camp for holding them until they... Oh!
[03:19:31.964 --> 03:19:34.726]  Oh, so the Holocaust did happen?
[03:19:34.726 --> 03:19:36.047]  Oh, thank you, thank you, Matt.
[03:19:36.047 --> 03:19:37.128]  This is amazing.
[03:19:37.128 --> 03:19:39.949]  Yesterday, someone calls Alex Jones, calls him a Jew.
[03:19:39.949 --> 03:19:41.830]  Alex says, okay, here's the platform.
[03:19:41.830 --> 03:19:43.692]  Today, someone says we can't debate on the Holocaust.
[03:19:43.692 --> 03:19:44.672]  What is going on in the world?
[03:19:44.672 --> 03:19:45.633]  Jack Masovic takes over.
[03:19:46.866 --> 03:19:51.330]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[03:19:51.330 --> 03:19:52.931]  Those times may be near.
[03:19:52.931 --> 03:19:53.832]  Think about it.
[03:19:53.832 --> 03:19:58.455]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[03:19:58.455 --> 03:20:03.099]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[03:20:03.439 --> 03:20:09.242]  And a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[03:20:09.242 --> 03:20:15.946]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[03:20:15.946 --> 03:20:18.508]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[03:20:18.948 --> 03:20:21.749]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.
[03:20:21.749 --> 03:20:24.250]  Get a 4-week survival food supply for only $99.

[03:24:18.655 --> 03:24:24.579]  Alex Jones, the thriller, is actually taking the fourth hour off.
[03:24:24.579 --> 03:24:26.621]  He's turned things over to Jack Basovics.
[03:24:26.621 --> 03:24:28.822]  I'm going to do a good job for him.

[03:24:33.325 --> 03:24:34.126]  He's researching.
[03:24:34.126 --> 03:24:36.447]  He's explaining a lot of things that are going on.
[03:24:36.447 --> 03:24:38.308]  He's conversing with his sources.
[03:24:38.308 --> 03:24:44.332]  Now, we're going to have me come forward because I've got explosive breaking news that you guys all need to hear.
[03:24:44.332 --> 03:24:46.814]  And we're going to be talking about everybody's
[03:24:47.554 --> 03:24:50.357]  Favorite group to hate, Antifa.
[03:24:50.357 --> 03:24:56.763]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've actually been able to break down now the funding for Antifa, the flow where it comes from.
[03:24:56.763 --> 03:25:06.532]  Now we've been talking about in the past how money had flown from George Soros and George Soros' coffers, his hedge fund money, all the way to these front groups for Antifa.
[03:25:06.892 --> 03:25:12.994]  Groups like Color of Change, groups like Smash Fascism, groups like By All Means.
[03:25:12.994 --> 03:25:16.954]  Those were the ones in the past that have been supporting Antifas.
[03:25:16.954 --> 03:25:20.315]  So we were very careful in keeping an eye on those groups.
[03:25:20.315 --> 03:25:31.478]  And Peter Hassan, over at Daily Caller, he did a great investigative job pouring through Federal Election Commission reports to see where these groups were getting their funding.
[03:25:32.202 --> 03:25:32.402]  I think?
[03:25:51.980 --> 03:25:55.124]  This was supposed to be her big coming out story.
[03:25:55.124 --> 03:26:01.991]  If she came out of the woods, you guys remember she was going in the woods all the time with her husband and she kept popping up here and there like Pennywise the Clown?
[03:26:01.991 --> 03:26:11.061]  Well, we are now finding out that $800,000 from her initial campaign, so people donated to Hillary Clinton's campaign, right?
[03:26:11.061 --> 03:26:14.004]  And if you donated to Hillary's campaign, you may have just been a rank-and-file Democrat
[03:26:14.324 --> 03:26:16.828]  You didn't support any of these extreme alt-left groups.
[03:26:16.828 --> 03:26:18.731]  You didn't support the violence in the streets.
[03:26:18.731 --> 03:26:20.834]  You just wanted to support a political candidate.
[03:26:20.834 --> 03:26:23.759]  Well, what Hillary Clinton has done is she's taken that money...
[03:26:24.511 --> 03:26:28.875]  Turned it over to her dark pack, her dark money pack, Onward Together.
[03:26:28.875 --> 03:26:38.622]  We call it a dark money pack because it doesn't have her name on it, it doesn't have a direct association with her campaign, but we all know that it's essentially the same people running it, right?
[03:26:38.622 --> 03:26:50.452]  She's still calling the shots when it comes down to it, the same way that she was doing this with the Bob Kramer groups and the bird-dogging that Project Veritas completely broke apart during the 2016 election and their excellent sting operations.
[03:26:50.852 --> 03:26:53.033]  Now we found that the $800,000, $800,000!
[03:26:53.033 --> 03:26:58.355]  And Matt, that's the same number as the people in DACA right now.
[03:26:58.355 --> 03:27:07.198]  So instead of giving money to DACA, instead of giving a dollar to every single one of these DACA recipients, what she's doing instead is turning and giving it over to Antifa.
[03:27:08.433 --> 03:27:12.274]  No, I would love if someone were to go up to Hillary at one of these events that she's having.
[03:27:12.274 --> 03:27:13.714]  She's having these book signings.
[03:27:13.714 --> 03:27:18.135]  She was just over in Costco in the toilet section, or excuse me, toilet paper section.
[03:27:18.135 --> 03:27:19.316]  Let's be, let's be true.
[03:27:19.316 --> 03:27:20.276]  We don't want to be fake news.
[03:27:20.276 --> 03:27:23.817]  We're gonna, we're gonna put the facts and let the facts lie where they lie.
[03:27:23.817 --> 03:27:29.578]  Hillary Clinton was in the toilet paper aisle yesterday at Costco, which is a sentence that is actually true in 2017.
[03:27:29.578 --> 03:27:33.079]  But instead of raising money for causes like the hurricane,
[03:27:33.991 --> 03:27:39.944]  For causes like Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Harvey, for the poor, for impoverished, for inner cities.
[03:27:39.944 --> 03:27:40.746]  No, no, no!
[03:27:40.746 --> 03:27:43.532]  She's giving money instead to Antifa.
[03:27:44.329 --> 03:27:50.313]  She's hiding behind her giant toilet paper wall and handing money over to Antifa.
[03:27:50.313 --> 03:27:55.977]  So the question now becomes, is Hillary Clinton the leader of Antifa, right?
[03:27:55.977 --> 03:28:02.941]  We all thought it was George Soros in the past, but now has Hillary Clinton risen to take upon that mantle, to take on that role?
[03:28:02.941 --> 03:28:10.326]  Because she couldn't win the presidency, and now the only roles that she's finding herself around are toilet paper roles.
[03:28:11.487 --> 03:28:14.270]  I gotta tell you guys, I'll be here all week.
[03:28:14.270 --> 03:28:16.152]  I write my own material on the Jack Posobiec Show.
[03:28:16.152 --> 03:28:16.933]  I'm just kidding.
[03:28:16.933 --> 03:28:22.038]  So, all of the violence though, you know, let's get serious for a second.
[03:28:22.038 --> 03:28:31.148]  All of the violence that Antifa has perpetrated, the attacks on police officers, the attacks on Trump supporters, the attacks on freedom of speech,
[03:28:32.009 --> 03:28:35.994]  Now Hillary Clinton is the candidate for president.
[03:28:35.994 --> 03:28:42.863]  We're not talking about some, you know, hugely circuitous route, the money laundering, all this stuff, sting operations.
[03:28:42.863 --> 03:28:46.227]  They're doing it brazenly and they're doing it in the open.
[03:28:46.227 --> 03:28:48.731]  They're doing it because they can think they can get away with it.
[03:28:49.111 --> 03:28:55.439]  They're doing it because they used to have James Comey as their bag man who covered up all of the crimes, who refused to prosecute.
[03:28:55.439 --> 03:29:04.229]  We found out that his evaluation was written before the investigation was over that was going to let her off the hook, but now she's not going to be let off the hook.
[03:29:04.818 --> 03:29:12.424]  Because we're doing the investigation, because people like Daily Caller are out there, and I urge you guys to go to their site, to go to the other sites and check this out.
[03:29:12.424 --> 03:29:14.386]  The Info War continues.
[03:29:14.386 --> 03:29:23.253]  The Info War completely continues, and we are not going to stop going after Hillary Clinton and going after the sources of money for groups like Antifa.
[03:29:23.253 --> 03:29:25.434]  We are going to hold their feet to the fire.
[03:29:25.434 --> 03:29:28.216]  We're going to let people know what's going on in this country.
[03:29:28.216 --> 03:29:30.959]  We are going to let people know, and we're going to follow the money.
[03:29:31.559 --> 03:29:36.328]  Because we know that the buck doesn't stop unless we stop it.
[03:29:47.745 --> 03:29:54.732]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote, Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[03:29:54.732 --> 03:30:00.237]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties, or in his possessions.
[03:30:00.237 --> 03:30:03.580]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[03:30:03.580 --> 03:30:05.942]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[03:30:05.942 --> 03:30:11.267]  And how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual?
[03:30:11.267 --> 03:30:12.869]  That is the ultimate concern.
[03:30:13.109 --> 03:30:19.351]  The concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[03:30:19.351 --> 03:30:21.771]  It was why the Anti-Federalists opposed the Constitution.
[03:30:21.771 --> 03:30:30.374]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power, but as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[03:30:30.674 --> 03:30:36.196]  But people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[03:30:36.196 --> 03:30:41.558]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[03:30:41.558 --> 03:30:44.999]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[03:30:47.702 --> 03:30:56.791]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:30:56.791 --> 03:31:05.199]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:05.199 --> 03:31:09.883]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:10.083 --> 03:31:16.868]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:31:16.868 --> 03:31:24.034]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:31:24.034 --> 03:31:31.059]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:31:31.059 --> 03:31:35.542]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:31:35.542 --> 03:31:38.765]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[03:31:47.111 --> 03:31:53.416]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:31:53.416 --> 03:31:55.518]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:31:55.518 --> 03:32:00.802]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:32:00.802 --> 03:32:04.525]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants that
[03:32:04.645 --> 03:32:08.087]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:32:08.087 --> 03:32:11.269]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[03:32:11.269 --> 03:32:15.152]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:32:15.152 --> 03:32:22.317]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:32:22.317 --> 03:32:28.461]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine,
[03:32:28.621 --> 03:32:30.023]  Nanosilver and more.
[03:32:30.023 --> 03:32:38.313]  Due to a request from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue that is Spearmint-free.
[03:32:38.313 --> 03:32:46.623]  Learn more about the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[03:33:00.920 --> 03:33:03.502]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:03.502 --> 03:33:09.986]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:33:13.470 --> 03:33:18.933]  Ladies and gentlemen, Jack Masovic takes over InfoWars, guest hosting here on The Big Fourth Hour.
[03:33:18.933 --> 03:33:24.015]  We have so much news to cover today because there's so much going on in our country.
[03:33:24.015 --> 03:33:32.679]  One thing I really wanted to get into, I really wanted to start covering, is folks, did you know, did you know that we are one week away from elections?
[03:33:33.467 --> 03:33:39.110]  Did you know that there is an election, a special election, happening in just one week?
[03:33:39.110 --> 03:33:40.051]  What am I talking about?
[03:33:40.051 --> 03:33:41.291]  I thought we had an election last year.
[03:33:41.291 --> 03:33:47.194]  Well actually, there's an election coming up, it's next week, and it's going to be in Alabama.
[03:33:47.194 --> 03:33:57.760]  Because what happened is, now you guys remember that Donald Trump, when he became president, he actually appointed a lot of people from Congress into his cabinet, into his administration.
[03:33:57.760 --> 03:34:01.182]  We've had congressmen that have gone in, we've had senators that have gone in.
[03:34:01.989 --> 03:34:08.016]  And right now, what we're doing is, we're replacing Jeff Sessions from the Alabama Senate.
[03:34:08.016 --> 03:34:09.658]  He has a race that's coming up.
[03:34:09.658 --> 03:34:12.161]  There's a special election to replace him.
[03:34:12.161 --> 03:34:16.306]  Now there was a primary, and now the primary is going to a runoff.
[03:34:16.306 --> 03:34:19.129]  The runoff election is happening just next week.
[03:34:19.409 --> 03:34:19.990]  We're good
[03:34:41.527 --> 03:34:53.490]  So, the primary election is a lot more, I should say, caustic and probably more important than the general, because it is most likely that a Republican is going to win the seat.
[03:34:53.490 --> 03:34:54.451]  This is session seat.
[03:34:54.451 --> 03:34:56.851]  It's a very safe seat for Republicans.
[03:34:56.851 --> 03:35:02.013]  And as long as a good Republican wins, a strong Republican candidate, I wouldn't say they're guaranteed to win.
[03:35:02.013 --> 03:35:05.614]  Obviously, anything can happen, especially these days in politics.
[03:35:05.614 --> 03:35:07.294]  But with my political analysis hat on,
[03:35:08.112 --> 03:35:08.172]  I'm
[03:35:28.046 --> 03:35:32.968]  You're just all a bunch of liberals and you're just going to go with whatever the deep liberal politics are from your area.
[03:35:32.968 --> 03:35:43.053]  Well no, we're actually free thinkers and we actually think about things instead of just kind of repeating whatever talking points the mainstream media and headlines are giving to us.
[03:35:43.053 --> 03:35:50.496]  So just because we support Trump, just because we support getting the real story out there, that doesn't mean we fall in line with everything else.
[03:35:51.886 --> 03:36:01.551]  Looking into this race, it breaks down a lot of stuff because there's Luther Strange, who's currently the sitting senator there.
[03:36:01.551 --> 03:36:07.595]  He used to be the Attorney General, and he was appointed to fill out the remainder of Sessions' term until the special election.
[03:36:07.595 --> 03:36:15.599]  So he's sitting there as acting senator, and then there's the Alabama Supreme Court Justice, Chief Justice Roy Moore.
[03:36:15.599 --> 03:36:20.682]  Now what's interesting in this is that President Trump has endorsed Luther Strange.
[03:36:21.238 --> 03:36:26.465]  However, Luther Strange is the establishment candidate in this case.
[03:36:26.465 --> 03:36:30.151]  Luther Strange, he's a Mitch McConnell supported candidate.
[03:36:30.151 --> 03:36:31.573]  They've already dumped eight...
[03:36:39.676 --> 03:36:42.158]  Commerce this guy and work for him.
[03:36:42.158 --> 03:36:51.105]  So there's a lot going on in terms of the establishment going to work for Luther strange Luther strange as it comes down to he is a former lobbyist.
[03:36:51.105 --> 03:36:53.687]  He is a former lobbyist for the chamber.
[03:36:53.687 --> 03:36:55.509]  He did a lot of work on that.
[03:36:55.509 --> 03:36:59.112]  He's done work on a lot of the chambers agreements in the past.
[03:37:00.043 --> 03:37:04.228]  Roy Moore, on the other hand, he is more of the Trump candidate.
[03:37:04.228 --> 03:37:08.674]  He's in line with the president when it comes to things like the RAISE Act.
[03:37:08.674 --> 03:37:17.365]  The RAISE Act is for merit-based immigration rather than DACA and just sort of this like amnesty type stuff.
[03:37:18.390 --> 03:37:25.096]  Luther Strange, on the other hand, has not given a position on the RAISE Act and he hasn't said whether or not he's for or against amnesty.
[03:37:25.096 --> 03:37:36.965]  The RAISE Act will change U.S., we're talking legal immigration here, would change that from the sort of chain migration system that we have now and push forward to a more merit-based system.
[03:37:36.965 --> 03:37:43.591]  Looking at the economic opportunities in America and figuring out which types of sets of skills do we want
[03:37:44.211 --> 03:37:59.366]  Or immigrants coming into the United States because when it comes down to it, the current immigration system in the United States was written a generation ago and the things and America as it was a generation ago is certainly different than America as it is today.
[03:37:59.366 --> 03:38:02.789]  So why are we still using the same policies that we did?
[03:38:03.639 --> 03:38:05.299]  A generation ago, right?
[03:38:05.299 --> 03:38:06.219]  That we use today.
[03:38:06.219 --> 03:38:07.680]  That's what the RAISE Act does.
[03:38:07.680 --> 03:38:14.801]  The RAISE Act takes a look at the board, wipes clean previous policies that we've had, and starts anew with a merit-based system.
[03:38:14.801 --> 03:38:28.123]  President Trump came very close to endorsing this, and so that's why people were very confused as to why he would then turn around and endorse a candidate like Luther Strange, who is the Chamber of Commerce's candidate.
[03:38:28.123 --> 03:38:32.704]  Many have called him, I don't know if I'd go this far just yet, they've called him a globalist candidate.
[03:38:33.084 --> 03:38:34.665]  Here's what it comes down to, folks.
[03:38:34.665 --> 03:38:38.588]  I don't necessarily think that Luther Strange is a bad guy.
[03:38:38.588 --> 03:38:43.611]  I don't think that most of the people in the establishment aren't necessarily bad people.
[03:38:43.611 --> 03:38:45.213]  That's just Jack Posobiec's opinion.
[03:38:45.213 --> 03:38:48.715]  But I think they have a different worldview.
[03:38:48.715 --> 03:38:52.558]  They have a worldview that people, immigrants,
[03:38:53.354 --> 03:38:54.435]  To our cheap labor
[03:39:24.315 --> 03:39:28.537]  I would say that you're being completely disingenuous and you're clueless as the actual issue.
[03:39:28.537 --> 03:39:36.503]  The 800,000 number only comes from people that have signed up under DACA amnesty, that's self-registered.
[03:39:36.503 --> 03:39:42.546]  So when Obama passed DACA in the first place through his executive fiat when he was the president right in the election year 2012,
[03:39:43.647 --> 03:39:46.469]  That 800,000 were the people that signed up.
[03:39:46.469 --> 03:39:53.095]  But there are still people that may have come into the United States illegally as children that did not register.
[03:39:53.095 --> 03:39:59.099]  That larger number has been estimated by some groups as to as many as 1, 2, even 3 million.
[03:40:01.321 --> 03:40:10.527]  Plus, if a new amnesty program was put forward, it may trigger another flood of four to six million foreign nationals from coming in.
[03:40:10.527 --> 03:40:16.251]  Because folks, when you offer people a free lunch, you're going to get more people to show up to your lunch than usual, right?
[03:40:16.251 --> 03:40:17.132]  If you say, hey guys!
[03:40:17.432 --> 03:40:18.573]  We're having free lunch.
[03:40:18.573 --> 03:40:19.973]  It's amnesty in America today.
[03:40:19.973 --> 03:40:21.894]  Do you want to sign up for the free amnesty?
[03:40:21.894 --> 03:40:31.919]  Of course you're going to get more people signing up than when you had to pay for it under the previous bill, under the previous administration's DACA executive order program.
[03:40:31.919 --> 03:40:33.740]  This would be legislation.
[03:40:33.740 --> 03:40:36.582]  This would be something that would be very hard to undo.
[03:40:36.582 --> 03:40:37.642]  You couldn't just rescind it.
[03:40:37.642 --> 03:40:41.144]  Now President Trump was able to rescind DACA because it was an executive order.
[03:40:41.144 --> 03:40:43.165]  So all he had to do was say, I rescind it.
[03:40:43.165 --> 03:40:45.586]  And he did it because he was president and that's all it had been done as.
[03:40:45.586 --> 03:40:46.347]  But if it's a law,
[03:40:46.907 --> 03:41:00.520]  If it's legislation, you actually have to go through other legislation in order to make any changes to it, to update it in any way, or you'd have to take it to court and say it was unconstitutional in some way, shape, or form.
[03:41:00.520 --> 03:41:12.911]  Either way, if this DREAM Act goes through and it's signed, there are going to be a lot more people coming in to take those jobs, to be eligible for those benefits,
[03:41:13.587 --> 03:41:18.651]  That people in the US currently who are struggling are not going to be able to get.
[03:41:18.651 --> 03:41:26.898]  And that's simply all of those issues are coming to play, coming to bear in this race in Alabama, which takes place next week.
[03:41:26.898 --> 03:41:27.619]  Now, there's another one.
[03:41:28.462 --> 03:41:30.364]  There's another issue to this, too.
[03:41:30.364 --> 03:41:34.849]  You know, people in the United States are talking about tearing down monuments these days.
[03:41:34.849 --> 03:41:42.818]  They're talking about tearing down... It started with the Confederate statues, and then it started with... And then they moved on to defacing the Lincoln Memorial.
[03:41:42.818 --> 03:41:45.161]  It moved on to people like Thomas Jefferson.
[03:41:45.161 --> 03:41:45.962]  They went after Francis...
[03:41:47.776 --> 03:41:51.180]  Yeah, they went after Francis Scott Key, and they said we have a racist anthem.
[03:41:51.180 --> 03:41:59.208]  So suddenly, it started right with the Confederate statues, but it moved forward as we all knew they would.
[03:41:59.208 --> 03:42:06.656]  Well, you go back and look, and what were the first monuments that the left tried to take down when their cultural Marxist movement got started?
[03:42:08.257 --> 03:42:11.619]  Confederate statues, it was Christian statues.
[03:42:11.619 --> 03:42:12.640]  Do you remember this?
[03:42:12.640 --> 03:42:24.927]  The Ten Commandments, there was a statue of them at the Alabama Courthouse, the Alabama Supreme Court, and the person that fought to keep them up was none other than Chief Justice Roy Moore.
[03:42:24.927 --> 03:42:29.590]  Now, I believe that Americans should have freedom of religion.
[03:42:29.590 --> 03:42:35.053]  That is part of our First Amendment, and whether you're Catholic, Christian, Buddhist, Jewish,
[03:42:35.653 --> 03:42:38.877]  Whatever religion you are, you should have the right to practice that freely in our country.
[03:42:38.877 --> 03:42:42.280]  That's enshrined in one of our founding documents, the Constitution.
[03:42:42.280 --> 03:42:46.385]  That being said, that doesn't mean that you have freedom from religion either.
[03:42:46.385 --> 03:42:49.228]  And that monument was set up there under Alabama law.
[03:42:50.177 --> 03:42:52.498]  It was voted for by the people of Alabama.
[03:42:52.498 --> 03:43:04.603]  They wanted it there, not to say that they were enforced by Alabama, that it was enforced, but just as a way of commemorating one of the earliest sources of law, the Ten Commandments.
[03:43:04.603 --> 03:43:11.346]  Roy Moore fought to keep that monument up because he understood the importance of Christian heritage.
[03:43:11.346 --> 03:43:14.828]  He understood the importance of knowing where
[03:43:15.698 --> 03:43:19.223]  Our laws come from our history of laws come from.
[03:43:19.223 --> 03:43:23.089]  That's that was really the main way that I knew about Roy Moore.
[03:43:23.089 --> 03:43:26.734]  The first thing that I had heard about him before he started running for Senate in the special election.
[03:43:28.087 --> 03:43:30.949]  And it's just something to put out there to people.
[03:43:30.949 --> 03:43:38.394]  I'm simply reporting the facts on the on the whole situation on the election, but it's a big thing and sitting here in Washington DC as I do.
[03:43:38.394 --> 03:43:42.736]  It's probably the biggest story right now next to and DC.
[03:43:42.736 --> 03:43:48.360]  They always talk about the fake Russia stuff, but there really is a big focus on this because people are going to see.
[03:43:49.080 --> 03:44:00.629]  Will the Trump endorsement of Strange, who's been kind of seen as a swamp creature, you can say it that way because he's a McConnell guy, will that endorsement be enough to carry him over the primary?
[03:44:00.629 --> 03:44:17.902]  Or will people who are supportive of the Trump agenda, people who are supportive of Make America Great Again, people who are supportive of immigration reform rather than amnesty, amnesty bills which have been pushed by the Chamber of Commerce, will those people be able to push Roy over the top?
[03:44:19.392 --> 03:44:24.486]  The President is going to Huntsville, Alabama this Saturday and holding a rally.
[03:44:25.345 --> 03:44:28.866]  That rally, he will endorse Luther Strange.
[03:44:28.866 --> 03:44:32.586]  And he'll probably bring Strange out at some point and say, Luther's a great guy.
[03:44:32.586 --> 03:44:34.227]  He talked about him a lot on Twitter.
[03:44:34.227 --> 03:44:35.547]  He called him Big Luther.
[03:44:35.547 --> 03:44:36.967]  He said, you have my support.
[03:44:36.967 --> 03:44:39.428]  So it's going to be interesting to see what happens down there.
[03:44:39.428 --> 03:44:41.168]  And I'm actually thinking of going down myself.
[03:44:41.168 --> 03:44:41.508]  I don't know.
[03:44:41.508 --> 03:44:43.168]  Do you guys think I should go or not?
[03:44:43.168 --> 03:44:44.008]  Give me a comment.
[03:44:44.008 --> 03:44:46.229]  Send me a message on Twitter.
[03:44:46.229 --> 03:44:47.369]  I may go.
[03:44:47.369 --> 03:44:48.269]  I may not go.
[03:44:48.269 --> 03:44:51.830]  But we're also seeing other people reach out and say that they
[03:44:52.944 --> 03:44:55.265]  Rather, endorse Roy Moore.
[03:44:55.265 --> 03:45:00.988]  Sarah Palin, probably the biggest name at this point, has come out in favor of Roy Moore.
[03:45:00.988 --> 03:45:12.614]  And she is saying, and putting her money on the line, putting her name on the line, her reputation on the line, with the conservative movement, with the grassroots movement, and saying, I don't support this guy Luther Strange.
[03:45:12.614 --> 03:45:17.496]  I support Moore because he stands with us on the issues.
[03:45:17.496 --> 03:45:19.417]  He's the grassroots conservative.
[03:45:19.717 --> 03:45:21.899]  He's the one that Sarah Palin has endorsed.
[03:45:21.899 --> 03:45:35.827]  So it's kind of a big, uh, I'm not going to say fracture, but I'm going to say it's a big issue right now within the Trump movement as to whether or not Strange is going to pull it out on Tuesday.
[03:45:35.827 --> 03:45:41.091]  And from a political analyst perspective, right, this is the kind of stuff that political junkies like me live for, right?
[03:45:41.661 --> 03:46:08.276]  People who are sitting and reading Drudge Report every day, they're reading Infowars every day, reading Breitbart, all of these sources, trying to figure out what's the state of the electorate, what do people want, where do people want them, you know, and I've been looking at some of these comments on these blogs, and every time, I gotta tell you, I do like to read comments, and people ask me about this, they say, Jack, you're doing so much stuff, you're always running around, you're getting married to Tanya Tay in less than two months, you know, how do you have time to do all this?
[03:46:08.276 --> 03:46:09.657]  And I say, you know why I read the comments?
[03:46:10.178 --> 03:46:13.072]  I read the comments because that gives you a sense.
[03:46:13.800 --> 03:46:15.721]  Of where the people are at.
[03:46:15.721 --> 03:46:22.604]  That gives you a sense of not only understanding where the people are at, it gives you a sense of testing the pulse.
[03:46:22.604 --> 03:46:27.626]  You know, really taking the pulse of America and knowing where people stand on one issue or another.
[03:46:27.626 --> 03:46:30.488]  And I've even had times where people said, hey, Jack, I think you're wrong on this.
[03:46:30.488 --> 03:46:31.528]  And I'll look it up.
[03:46:31.528 --> 03:46:34.650]  And if I'm wrong on something, I'll say, wow, I had that totally wrong.
[03:46:34.650 --> 03:46:35.970]  And I'll publish.
[03:46:35.970 --> 03:46:37.071]  Hey, guys, update.
[03:46:37.071 --> 03:46:38.031]  I got more information.
[03:46:38.031 --> 03:46:39.812]  Man, I was totally wrong on this.
[03:46:39.812 --> 03:46:40.832]  You guys set me straight.
[03:46:40.832 --> 03:46:41.853]  And I appreciate that.
[03:46:42.373 --> 03:46:47.115]  That's the type of interaction that we have that the mainstream media will never have.
[03:46:47.115 --> 03:47:00.080]  That's the type of interaction that we have and the willingness to step forward on certain issues, regardless of what it is, dig deep into those issues, and not turn around and say, we were right, we were right, we were right.
[03:47:00.080 --> 03:47:04.982]  But be willing to listen to people, to listen to facts, and actually say, you know what?
[03:47:05.856 --> 03:47:07.497]  We may have gotten something wrong.
[03:47:07.497 --> 03:47:11.500]  I've got new information now that says this is actually the case.
[03:47:11.500 --> 03:47:14.462]  What I reported earlier wasn't the full story.
[03:47:14.462 --> 03:47:16.703]  So we're going to give you all sides of the story.
[03:47:16.703 --> 03:47:19.165]  And that's why the mainstream media wants to shut us down.
[03:47:19.165 --> 03:47:23.207]  That's why Facebook and Google are working so hard to push back on us.
[03:47:23.207 --> 03:47:27.570]  And one story that I picked up earlier today that I think is absolutely
[03:47:28.454 --> 03:47:30.675]  Magnanimous.
[03:47:30.675 --> 03:47:49.944]  Something that's going to be one of the biggest stories of 2017 is that there are now actually people in both parties, the Republicans and the Democrats, that are moving to regulate and possibly break up Facebook, Google, and other big tech companies.
[03:47:49.944 --> 03:47:51.885]  So there's legislation that's being looked at
[03:47:52.679 --> 03:48:01.205]  And it's being supported by both the populist conservative movement and people that are Democrats, like Mark Warner.
[03:48:01.205 --> 03:48:01.906]  Okay?
[03:48:01.906 --> 03:48:13.735]  They're looking and saying, we've seen the way that they're censoring Gab, we've seen the way that they're throttling back on Breitbart, on Infowars, on anybody that doesn't tow the mainstream media line.
[03:48:13.735 --> 03:48:20.340]  But it's also this censorship and this huge amount of influence that these organizations have
[03:48:20.720 --> 03:48:29.406]  That are starting to put them more and more under the purview of having them possibly regulated as public utilities.
[03:48:29.406 --> 03:48:32.829]  The antitrust laws that are on the books.
[03:48:33.692 --> 03:48:39.115]  Okay, and these were used against the telephone companies about a hundred years ago when they first came out.
[03:48:39.115 --> 03:48:51.983]  These were used against the oil companies, the steel companies, because they got so big and they had so much influence and so much power in the United States that there were groups that said, you know what?
[03:48:51.983 --> 03:48:53.924]  These companies have become so large
[03:48:54.508 --> 03:49:02.740]  They've become so powerful that they are almost like governments unto themselves in their ability to influence information.
[03:49:02.740 --> 03:49:06.044]  Tucker Carlson had a great line, and I've got to give credit where it's due.
[03:49:06.044 --> 03:49:06.365]  He said,
[03:49:08.479 --> 03:49:16.486]  Almost regulates reality itself because Google is a filter through which we learn about our world.
[03:49:16.486 --> 03:49:19.488]  The first thing you go to to look up something is Google.
[03:49:19.488 --> 03:49:27.594]  They have an insane amount of market share when it comes to the search markets in the United States in terms of who uses Google, right?
[03:49:27.594 --> 03:49:29.035]  You don't hear people talking about Yahoo.
[03:49:29.035 --> 03:49:30.677]  You don't hear people talking about Bing.
[03:49:30.677 --> 03:49:31.938]  Google is a verb.
[03:49:31.938 --> 03:49:33.299]  It's something that people put out there.
[03:49:34.071 --> 03:49:58.162]  And so if this organization, whether it be a government organization or a private organization, and I would even contend, I would even contend, and libertarians disagree with me on this, I would contend that Google and Facebook, because of their collusion and working hand in glove with the Obama administration, with Congress, with regulatory bodies, they are practically
[03:49:59.415 --> 03:50:00.635]  We're good to go.
[03:50:18.041 --> 03:50:20.984]  What happens when they hand it to the Deep State?
[03:50:20.984 --> 03:50:22.165]  We're going to be right back.
[03:50:22.165 --> 03:50:23.106]  We're going to finish it out.
[03:50:23.106 --> 03:50:26.188]  We're going to talk a little bit more about the Russia narrative.
[03:50:26.188 --> 03:50:27.729]  What stuff is coming up?
[03:50:27.729 --> 03:50:29.691]  I want to hear from you guys, if we can.
[03:50:29.691 --> 03:50:31.873]  I want you guys to check out the InfoWars store.
[03:50:31.873 --> 03:50:33.354]  There's so much great stuff on there.

[03:54:16.451 --> 03:54:22.654]  Folks, Alex Jones is letting Jack Posobiec co-host for the big fourth hour today.
[03:54:22.654 --> 03:54:24.514]  I couldn't be more gracious.
[03:54:24.514 --> 03:54:28.656]  I couldn't be more thankful and appreciative to Alex for turning the show over to me.
[03:54:28.656 --> 03:54:31.217]  But I gotta tell you, Alex, you might be making a very big mistake.
[03:54:31.217 --> 03:54:32.478]  I'm just kidding.
[03:54:32.478 --> 03:54:34.359]  So what is going on in the world?
[03:54:34.359 --> 03:54:38.701]  Guys, we're now seeing this Trump-Russia investigation.
[03:54:38.701 --> 03:54:40.121]  It's going forward.
[03:54:40.121 --> 03:54:41.842]  There's a lot of people talking about it.
[03:54:42.671 --> 03:54:50.598]  Mueller, Robert Mueller, former head of the FBI, now running as the independent counsel of this thing.
[03:54:50.598 --> 03:55:05.531]  And there was this sort of an interesting thing that happened over the weekend where a lawyer, believe it or not, a lawyer for the Trump presidency, for the administration, was actually having dinner, or excuse me, I think it was having lunch, believe it or not, for
[03:55:07.478 --> 03:55:09.259]  I think?
[03:55:30.450 --> 03:55:31.751]  I served in Navy Intelligence.
[03:55:31.751 --> 03:55:33.433]  I was a former Navy Intelligence officer.
[03:55:33.433 --> 03:55:40.058]  I didn't used to talk about this, but nowadays I do talk about it because NBC blew my cover and decided to release all my records.
[03:55:40.058 --> 03:55:40.819]  So they doxed me.
[03:55:40.819 --> 03:55:41.579]  They put it out there.
[03:55:41.579 --> 03:55:42.440]  So fine.
[03:55:42.440 --> 03:55:43.141]  I will admit it.
[03:55:43.141 --> 03:55:58.293]  Yes, I was a Navy Intelligence officer, but tradecraft wise, you would not normally go to talk about sensitive topics at a public steakhouse, especially one that was only a few doors down from the New York Times office.
[03:55:58.533 --> 03:56:03.160]  So my question is, my question is, was this deliberate?
[03:56:03.160 --> 03:56:06.664]  Was this something that they wanted to actually have out there?
[03:56:06.664 --> 03:56:09.889]  And one of the things they're worried of is that Mueller may be going
[03:56:10.572 --> 03:56:24.256]  And putting wires on people in the White House, putting wires on them to go to get them to rat out their buddies, to go to get them to get dirt on anybody they think that could be in the White House that they want to go after.
[03:56:24.256 --> 03:56:33.418]  And folks, this really just goes to show you how completely lacking in evidence or in merit the investigation has at this point.
[03:56:33.418 --> 03:56:36.879]  If they're getting people to wear wires and going into the White House, number one,
[03:56:37.399 --> 03:56:42.021]  If you're collecting on classified information, that's absolutely illegal.
[03:56:42.021 --> 03:56:46.922]  You cannot steal classified information, regardless of who you are.
[03:56:46.922 --> 03:56:53.345]  Unless they've got some, they must have had some kind of crazy FISA warrant to be going and putting spies into the White House.
[03:56:53.345 --> 03:57:05.989]  So Mueller putting spies, and this isn't something that we're just saying guys, this is in Newsweek, this is in The Independent, there is actually a worry that Mueller is now spying on the White House, spying on the President, because they have
[03:57:06.813 --> 03:57:08.415]  No evidence whatsoever.
[03:57:08.415 --> 03:57:11.777]  They've turned over all the information they've been asked to.
[03:57:11.777 --> 03:57:13.299]  They've answered every subpoena.
[03:57:13.299 --> 03:57:19.964]  They've gone to great lengths to comply with Mueller, but Mueller doesn't care because, folks, it's not really about Russia.
[03:57:19.964 --> 03:57:21.786]  It's about taking down the president.
[03:57:21.786 --> 03:57:23.747]  It's about taking down our movement.
[03:57:23.747 --> 03:57:28.431]  It's about blocking the president's movement from getting into place.
[03:57:28.431 --> 03:57:30.073]  I've always said that.
[03:57:30.073 --> 03:57:31.274]  I've always said that.
[03:57:31.274 --> 03:57:33.035]  But even though they've cooperated fully,
[03:57:34.406 --> 03:57:38.208]  And there's been some talk about strategy, about how they wanted to cooperate.
[03:57:38.208 --> 03:57:40.790]  The investigation isn't about Russia.
[03:57:40.790 --> 03:57:42.831]  There is no Russia collusion.
[03:57:42.831 --> 03:57:44.332]  It was a canard.
[03:57:44.332 --> 03:57:46.053]  There were no Russians involved.
[03:57:46.053 --> 03:57:50.376]  The people involved with winning the presidency were the American people.
[03:57:50.376 --> 03:57:54.398]  The Citizens for Trump that I wrote about in my book, Citizens for Trump.
[03:57:54.398 --> 03:57:57.520]  It was the people of InfoWars, the InfoWarriors.
[03:57:57.520 --> 03:57:58.821]  That is how we won.
[03:57:58.821 --> 03:58:00.482]  That is how we took back this country.
[03:58:00.482 --> 03:58:02.163]  And we're not going anywhere.
[03:58:02.163 --> 03:58:04.204]  We're not going to stop fighting for this movement.
[03:58:04.384 --> 03:58:07.167]  We're not going to stop fighting for this agenda.
[03:58:07.167 --> 03:58:10.050]  I want to say thank you to Alex for allowing me to co-host for today.
[03:58:10.050 --> 03:58:11.611]  I really appreciate coming on.
