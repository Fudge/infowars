[00:00.000 --> 00:15.240]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:15.240 --> 00:21.720]  Rallying Patriots worldwide.
[00:21.720 --> 00:28.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28.720 --> 00:30.960]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30.960 --> 00:40.560]  It is Monday, September 18, 2017, and we have a ton of news for you.
[00:40.560 --> 00:47.000]  We've got higher education departments wanting to change the words freshman and upperclassman
[00:47.000 --> 00:48.960]  because that is triggering.
[00:48.960 --> 00:54.920]  Of course, we've got the Emmys that just defecated all over themselves last night.
[00:54.920 --> 01:01.800]  We've got 80 arrests in St. Louis as they're getting ready for a third day of protests.
[01:01.800 --> 01:09.920]  Got all kinds of news talking about China, Venezuela, just international news like that.
[01:09.920 --> 01:12.480]  Washington Post writer says Trump is literally killing him.
[01:12.480 --> 01:13.720]  Oh my goodness.
[01:13.720 --> 01:19.520]  We've got a video of peaceful Muslims beating the crap out of feminist protesters.
[01:19.520 --> 01:20.520]  So we'll get to all that.
[01:20.520 --> 01:26.920]  We've got big reports coming from Alex Jones, including one on a CIA whistleblower.
[01:26.920 --> 01:28.680]  You don't want to miss that.
[01:28.680 --> 01:32.840]  I think Hillary Clinton is still hanging out in the toilet paper aisle of Costco right
[01:32.840 --> 01:33.840]  now.
[01:33.840 --> 01:37.160]  I'm not so sure if she's managed to find her way out of that yet.
[01:37.160 --> 01:39.720]  But that's where Hillary Clinton was last seen.
[01:39.720 --> 01:41.720]  So we've got all of this news.
[01:41.720 --> 01:45.200]  You've got terror attacks happening in London.
[01:45.200 --> 01:47.040]  But what does the UN say?
[01:47.040 --> 01:50.400]  The big question, according to the UN, is what to make of Trump?
[01:50.400 --> 01:57.520]  I found this so hysterically maddening that the UN would sit here and act like Trump is
[01:57.520 --> 01:59.000]  the biggest problem on the world.
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.360]  Meanwhile, North Korea is threatening America.
[02:02.360 --> 02:04.200]  Venezuela is completely collapsing.
[02:04.200 --> 02:09.440]  Radical Islamic terror is attacking in London five times so far this year, all over Europe.
[02:09.440 --> 02:10.760]  So you've got all that going on.
[02:10.760 --> 02:14.160]  But CNN freaks out about the most ridiculous stuff.
[02:14.160 --> 02:17.480]  So the UN says that, oh, what do we make of Trump?
[02:17.480 --> 02:18.480]  Trump is a huge deal.
[02:18.480 --> 02:20.040]  We need to do something about Trump.
[02:20.040 --> 02:23.560]  Considering all the other problems, as actually Hurricane Maria looks like maybe coming down
[02:23.560 --> 02:25.520]  the same path as Irma.
[02:25.520 --> 02:31.040]  But CNN likes to attack Trump with low blows, including one video that went viral of a young
[02:31.040 --> 02:34.040]  man that was mowing the White House lawn.
[02:34.040 --> 02:37.960]  Trump took a step outside, said, hey, congratulations, young entrepreneur.
[02:37.960 --> 02:42.720]  CNN took this story, ran with it, had to give it a twist, and leave it to Mark Dice to get
[02:42.720 --> 02:44.480]  the lemonade out of that lemon.
[02:44.480 --> 02:46.120]  Here's a report from Mark Dice.
[02:46.120 --> 02:47.120]  Good evening.
[02:47.120 --> 02:48.120]  I'm Anderson Cooper.
[02:48.120 --> 02:52.160]  Tonight, we have some disturbing footage to show you of President Trump using forced
[02:52.160 --> 02:55.600]  child labor to mow the lawn at the White House.
[02:55.600 --> 02:59.920]  Our sources tell us the president has tried to keep the budget down and laid off the ground
[02:59.920 --> 03:04.200]  keepers and decided to use slave labor instead.
[03:04.200 --> 03:09.280]  Here the president can be seen harassing the poor child slave for not working fast enough.
[03:09.280 --> 03:14.280]  When the boy's father came out to rescue his son, President Trump said to the man, I could
[03:14.280 --> 03:19.080]  buy your wife, you peasant, and told him to start weed whacking along the fence, or he
[03:19.080 --> 03:21.840]  would send his son to North Korea.
[03:21.840 --> 03:27.440]  Let's bring in CNN's token blackhost, a descendant of slaves, Don Levin, for his reaction.
[03:27.440 --> 03:28.440]  Don?
[03:28.440 --> 03:29.440]  Thank you, sweetie.
[03:29.440 --> 03:33.120]  I mean, Anderson, some Republicans say that the boy wanted to mow the grass and that he
[03:33.120 --> 03:35.400]  mows his neighbor's lawns.
[03:35.400 --> 03:40.720]  Even if true, and those are just unsubstantiated rumors being spread by Fox News, that would
[03:40.720 --> 03:46.000]  still prove problematic, because if that is the case, the president has stoned favoritism
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.080]  to a white kid in a sense stealing a job from a Mexican.
[03:51.080 --> 03:56.120]  And the fact is that, again, even if these rumors aren't true, that the boy volunteered
[03:56.120 --> 04:02.040]  for the job, this is more sexism at the hands of the president, giving the job to a boy
[04:02.040 --> 04:07.400]  instead of a girl, further perpetuating the patriarchal myth that girls aren't strong
[04:07.400 --> 04:13.320]  enough to push his lawnmower, and thus continuing to reinforce these toxic gender roles that
[04:13.320 --> 04:16.080]  are being forced onto our children.
[04:16.080 --> 04:17.080]  Anderson?
[04:17.080 --> 04:23.120]  Disturbing indeed, the former labor reporter for the New York Times had this to say, quote,
[04:23.120 --> 04:29.320]  this is not setting a great signal on child labor, minimum wage, and occupational safety,
[04:29.320 --> 04:30.320]  end quote.
[04:30.320 --> 04:34.400]  We reached out to him to confirm, and this is not a satirical tweet.
[04:34.400 --> 04:39.760]  He is 100% serious, and he really is from the New York Times.
[04:39.760 --> 04:42.040]  This is just disgusting.
[04:42.040 --> 04:46.720]  It sure is, and every day now the president seems to confirm our suspicions, even when
[04:46.720 --> 04:49.720]  we keep giving him the benefit of the doubt.
[04:49.720 --> 04:53.680]  Stay tuned to CNN for the latest bias, I mean breaking news.
[04:53.680 --> 04:55.400]  Here's Mark Dice with an important message from us.
[04:55.400 --> 04:56.400]  That's Mark Dice.
[04:56.400 --> 04:58.680]  We'll have more from Alex Jones on the other side.
[04:58.680 --> 05:02.480]  What exactly is political correctness, and why is it being pushed on the American public?
[05:02.480 --> 05:06.760]  Well political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government
[05:06.760 --> 05:08.600]  uses to control public opinion.
[05:08.600 --> 05:12.680]  By controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda,
[05:12.680 --> 05:17.120]  but to also ensure that your government-created viewpoint also influences others in a ripple
[05:17.120 --> 05:18.120]  effect.
[05:18.120 --> 05:20.240]  This is how the power elite and the government stay in power.
[05:20.240 --> 05:24.280]  They use psychological manipulation to turn the public into obedient sheeple, and over
[05:24.280 --> 05:27.800]  time we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception.
[05:27.800 --> 05:30.960]  But how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work?
[05:30.960 --> 05:34.960]  Well first, the establishment saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying to
[05:34.960 --> 05:39.880]  push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted as truth, such as
[05:39.880 --> 05:41.440]  global warming for example.
[05:41.440 --> 05:45.800]  Then the establishment suppresses any counter-arguments through their agenda by calling critics kooky,
[05:45.800 --> 05:50.560]  nutjobs, racists, or in the case of man-made climate change, climate deniers.
[05:50.560 --> 05:55.240]  You can learn more about this tyranny over the minds of men at infowars.com, PrismPlanet.tv,
[05:55.240 --> 05:57.080]  and our YouTube channel Resistance News.
[05:57.080 --> 06:04.080]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[06:57.080 --> 07:04.080]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[07:27.080 --> 07:34.080]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[07:57.080 --> 08:04.080]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[08:27.080 --> 08:32.240]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, huge news to cover today.
[08:32.240 --> 08:37.680]  Huge breaking reports from Alex Jones, a ton of video clips including all of the Trump
[08:37.680 --> 08:41.920]  derangement that we saw at the Emmys last night, or actually I guess that we didn't
[08:41.920 --> 08:46.040]  see because nobody watched it, and the only reason anybody's talking about it is because
[08:46.040 --> 08:47.920]  of how pathetic they are.
[08:47.920 --> 08:53.520]  Alex has some news with a CIA whistleblower, you're gonna get that report from Alex Jones.
[08:53.520 --> 08:57.640]  We're gonna have all of the Emmys debacle that was last night.
[08:57.640 --> 09:02.800]  We've got more on the Trump Russia probe, Trump lawyers debating what to do, meanwhile
[09:02.800 --> 09:07.440]  more Clinton Obama lawyers are going into that probe.
[09:07.440 --> 09:12.720]  You've got schools now wanting to change their names, because they're named after Jefferson
[09:12.720 --> 09:16.960]  and Madison, now they want to change their names, Yale is swapping out freshmen and upperclassmen
[09:16.960 --> 09:18.880]  with gender neutral terms.
[09:18.880 --> 09:21.080]  What the heck is going on on this planet?
[09:21.080 --> 09:26.840]  80 arrests as riots gripped St. Louis for third day after ex cops acquittal and fatal
[09:26.840 --> 09:27.840]  shooting.
[09:27.840 --> 09:33.200]  There's a reason why we keep seeing this, a lot of it has to do with television pundits
[09:33.200 --> 09:37.080]  or personalities on CNN, we'll have those clips as well.
[09:37.080 --> 09:42.520]  But first, let's go to Alex Jones, who has filed a special report, he's gonna have more
[09:42.520 --> 09:48.360]  reports throughout the day today, including one on a CIA whistleblower, but first, here
[09:48.360 --> 09:52.960]  is Alex Jones.
[09:52.960 --> 10:00.440]  Social engineers want you blinded by the background noise, it's time to turn it off.
[10:00.440 --> 10:08.480]  Time to focus intellectually, politically, spiritually on the real architecture of this
[10:08.480 --> 10:10.480]  new world order.
[10:10.480 --> 10:19.560]  It's time to read the seminal publications and declassifications of the technocrats
[10:19.560 --> 10:27.480]  program, it's time to realize that info wars is not Alex Jones' opinion, but is simply
[10:27.480 --> 10:37.760]  an analysis of what the planetary shadow government is establishing and how that planetary system
[10:37.760 --> 10:46.040]  is absorbing not just human society, but the biospheres of the globe and this ecosystem
[10:46.040 --> 10:48.560]  that is space ship earth.
[10:48.560 --> 10:52.680]  Coming up today, Owen Stroyer is going to be hosting with a bunch of important guests
[10:52.680 --> 10:59.880]  and news, he's gonna cover the culture wars and how those are accelerating, but the backdrop,
[10:59.880 --> 11:05.840]  the most important point to understand from my perspective is that everything you see
[11:05.840 --> 11:13.120]  from MTV and the death culture and the gangbanger culture and the cop killer George Soros culture
[11:13.120 --> 11:23.360]  and the Hollywood anti-family anti-crisis system is a function of the mode and the psychology
[11:23.360 --> 11:30.120]  and the worldview and the plan of the large tax refundations that Congress has even had
[11:30.120 --> 11:38.240]  hearings on whose plan is to overturn not just civilization, but human operations as
[11:38.240 --> 11:45.680]  they biologically exist in what is called the final revolution or the end of history.
[11:45.680 --> 11:49.560]  Anyone listening can just write down these terms I'm giving you, type them into a search
[11:49.560 --> 11:54.040]  engine and go down the rabbit hole, not of something I said or something Ron Paul said
[11:54.040 --> 12:01.320]  or something like Matt Drudge said or Nigel Farage said or Donald Frum, but what the globalists
[12:01.320 --> 12:10.240]  themselves have been saying and a lot of it is 170 years old, much of it's from the 1850s
[12:10.240 --> 12:17.680]  and the whole plan you could say is divinely inspired but not with a big D, the little
[12:17.680 --> 12:22.080]  D for Diablo.
[12:22.080 --> 12:26.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a great experiment we're all part of, it's an amazing time to
[12:26.600 --> 12:34.720]  be alive, we see the ongoing insanity in St. Louis as total racial division is hyped
[12:34.720 --> 12:40.600]  by the corporate media, we see in Dallas, Texas, now one of the Democrats think they
[12:40.600 --> 12:46.080]  can make the state go blue, we see Dallas, Texas a Democrat stronghold now preparing
[12:46.080 --> 12:52.520]  to remove Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, they're not going to stop
[12:52.520 --> 12:56.440]  until they remove the name of the country, the flag, the whole system because it's not
[12:56.440 --> 13:05.000]  about stopping any wrongs, it's about exercising power and using the true openness of the West
[13:05.000 --> 13:11.840]  our strength as a weakness against us, that's why we must focus and stoically stand against
[13:11.840 --> 13:16.720]  the social engineering and not give in to virtue signaling or political correctness
[13:16.720 --> 13:21.760]  even though we want to let people know who are attacking us that we don't hate them because
[13:21.760 --> 13:26.760]  of what color they are when we give in to all the virtue signaling and say now I'm not
[13:26.760 --> 13:31.720]  racist but I understand and let's be friends and let's work this out and let me compromise
[13:31.720 --> 13:37.920]  with you, you're only giving in to the psychological warfare template whereby increments we always
[13:37.920 --> 13:43.000]  compromise and the establishment never does and then the throngs of people we're trying
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.720]  to satisfy and trying to work with and trying to live next to and trying to get along with
[13:47.720 --> 13:52.080]  they get even more enslaved than ever, we're all being used as pawns in this and it's
[13:52.080 --> 13:58.280]  time to realize the game and to transcend it, there's so much other news coming up
[13:58.280 --> 14:06.680]  today the latest ridiculous award show with a bunch of out of touch Hollywood scum giving
[14:06.680 --> 14:12.680]  each other awards and of course it had record low ratings, the good news is humanity across
[14:12.680 --> 14:20.080]  the globe is breaking with the globalist, in fact when I talk to people who live in
[14:20.080 --> 14:23.760]  third world nations they're a lot more awake on average than the average American because
[14:23.760 --> 14:27.440]  they've actually seen the scams they've been through the frauds just like people that grew
[14:27.440 --> 14:32.960]  up in Eastern Europe under communism they see almost to a person right through all this
[14:32.960 --> 14:37.320]  because they've heard it all before they've seen the lies they've been through the process
[14:37.320 --> 14:41.880]  and revelation is the best way to learn things where you just divinely understand something
[14:41.880 --> 14:48.800]  innately whether it's from God or instinct and then of course you can learn by experience
[14:48.800 --> 14:53.800]  sticking your hand down the garbage disposal and turning it on or you can learn by being
[14:53.800 --> 15:00.240]  taught you can learn by people that have been through it before and that's really the best
[15:00.240 --> 15:04.400]  way to learn you can experience it and see it right there for yourself and others who
[15:04.400 --> 15:08.400]  have experienced it and see it for themselves and there's not any denial about what we're
[15:08.400 --> 15:13.280]  facing the average people that have bought into the system of political correctness and
[15:13.280 --> 15:18.960]  control do it because they feel powerless and they feel like if they learn this new language
[15:18.960 --> 15:22.720]  of having a chip on your shoulder that somehow they'll get ahead when they haven't gotten
[15:22.720 --> 15:27.920]  ahead before and I call it a lottery mentality and I'm not bashing anybody that's gone out
[15:27.920 --> 15:31.160]  and bought a lottery ticket to have fun and you know watch the show and have some excitement
[15:31.160 --> 15:35.760]  and be part of something but it's designed to screw you over it's a tax on the poor and
[15:35.760 --> 15:40.760]  the very same people that vote Democrat and the various people that buy into political
[15:40.760 --> 15:43.800]  correctness are the very same type of people whether they be black or white Hispanic old
[15:43.800 --> 15:48.160]  young that believe that they're gonna be okay because the next lottery ticket's gonna be
[15:48.160 --> 15:52.400]  their big one they're gonna have a hundred million dollars they've been scammed and what's
[15:52.400 --> 15:56.640]  frustrating is it's in the WikiLeaks it's in the Facebook documents it's in all the documents
[15:56.640 --> 16:03.920]  that the social engineers are totally ruthless and are doing all these horrible things worldwide
[16:03.920 --> 16:09.640]  and really hate humanity but they manipulate folks that want a free ride the Republican
[16:09.640 --> 16:15.160]  Party establishments our enemy the Democratic Party establishments our enemy and we've moved
[16:15.160 --> 16:20.960]  so far that people like Donald Trump have arrived on the scene as a manifestation as a surfer
[16:20.960 --> 16:26.000]  riding the great wave of awakening but that doesn't mean we rise or fall with Donald Trump
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.800]  we rise and fall on you what's in your heart what's in your mind seeing through the deception
[16:31.800 --> 16:37.000]  understanding the great historical moment we're all in now I'm gonna hand this back over
[16:37.000 --> 16:43.560]  to Owen Shroyer over the weekend zero hedge published a big article we republished it
[16:43.560 --> 16:49.480]  on info wars dot com with a high level CIA whistleblower friends with William Benny his
[16:49.480 --> 16:56.240]  bona fides are you know the best out there exposing how shadow government controls the
[16:56.240 --> 17:01.280]  deep state and what they're trying to establish but then I get into the rest of the story
[17:01.280 --> 17:05.200]  towards the end of the breakdown about what their end game is that's coming up at the
[17:05.200 --> 17:09.960]  bottom of the hour it's very very important I shot it yesterday we're gonna premiere it
[17:09.960 --> 17:14.920]  here and that's gonna be posted to info wars dot com and news wars dot com and I'm gonna
[17:14.920 --> 17:19.880]  get this gentleman on Mr. Ship in the very very near future we're gonna get Mr. Benny
[17:19.880 --> 17:24.840]  back on as well former technical director of the NSA but this just confirms the exact
[17:24.840 --> 17:29.360]  architecture that I've already laid out not again because I figured it out myself but
[17:29.360 --> 17:34.160]  because of the church hearings and the Iran contra hearings and others we get a very good
[17:34.160 --> 17:39.600]  snapshot of how this operates plus we can see it manifested at point blank range but
[17:39.600 --> 17:45.160]  remember most of the people in the deep state are controlled as well and our compartmentalized
[17:45.160 --> 17:50.840]  are actually good people it's the shadow government that's key and it was threatened by Trump
[17:50.840 --> 17:55.960]  and the people's attempt to actually take control of our government again that's why
[17:55.960 --> 17:59.720]  they're so angry and trying to isolate Trump and so upset that people are able to talk
[17:59.720 --> 18:03.760]  to him that the public could influence him because they believe it's their right they
[18:03.760 --> 18:10.440]  believe they are the global republic and that they own the government and they own the system
[18:10.440 --> 18:14.120]  but in truth they're the very people that have been selling out the country and selling
[18:14.120 --> 18:18.840]  out the republic not just from their own documents that prove it but from their actions through
[18:18.840 --> 18:23.600]  the popular culture and there's now a rebellion within the deep state in the shadow government

[29:49.600 --> 30:00.880]  on the other side and the gcn radio network it was thomas jefferson who once said that our country
[30:00.880 --> 30:05.280]  is now taking so steady a course as to show by what rodeo will pass to destruction to wit by
[30:05.280 --> 30:10.480]  consolidation of power first and then corruption its necessary consequence jefferson was warning us
[30:10.480 --> 30:14.560]  about the global elite the one percent of the one percent consolidating the world's wealth and
[30:14.560 --> 30:19.040]  subverting the people's voice in government unfortunately we didn't heed his advice we now
[30:19.040 --> 30:23.360]  live in a neo feudalistic society in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to
[30:23.360 --> 30:27.200]  serve the needs of the establishment political office no longer represents the voice of the
[30:27.200 --> 30:32.480]  people but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy
[30:32.480 --> 30:36.320]  simply put we the people are responsible for civilization and culture yet we're suppressed
[30:36.320 --> 30:40.320]  by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world
[30:40.320 --> 30:44.720]  we falsely believe that everything is simply black and white one extreme against the other
[30:44.720 --> 30:49.040]  conservative versus liberal but things will change once more of us realize this truth as thomas
[30:49.040 --> 30:53.760]  jefferson also said enlighten the people generally and tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind
[30:53.760 --> 30:59.040]  will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day this is kit daniels with info wars dot com

[33:18.720 --> 33:25.280]  jones i'm sure you're here for alex jones we're going to hear from alex jones in this segment
[33:25.280 --> 33:31.840]  in five minutes on a breaking report on a cia whistleblower but first you may wonder why you're
[33:31.840 --> 33:35.760]  seeing all these marches why are all these angry people marching for black lives matter why are
[33:35.760 --> 33:40.480]  they screaming at white people in the streets why do the marches continue well there's an answer for
[33:40.480 --> 33:47.200]  that it's not just the funding that they get from george soros groups but it's mainstream media folks
[33:47.200 --> 33:52.880]  it's mainstream media virtue signaling and and quite frankly just outright lying to these people
[33:52.880 --> 33:58.560]  using propaganda to get them out into the streets to trigger their emotions and to make them believe
[33:58.560 --> 34:06.480]  things that aren't actually happening so we just played some videos of protesters in st lewis
[34:06.480 --> 34:13.600]  upset over the acquittal of an x cop for a murder of lamar smith which you look at the case it doesn't
[34:13.600 --> 34:19.040]  look good it doesn't look good but you have to ask yourself the question why are they marching over
[34:19.040 --> 34:24.960]  this case and lamar smith why aren't they marching over isaia hamit you see if you look at isaia
[34:24.960 --> 34:31.440]  hamit's case who was also killed by a swat team in st lewis it's not ambiguous it's pretty obvious
[34:31.440 --> 34:37.040]  what happened and when you look at the statements from the police it looks even worse but why don't
[34:37.040 --> 34:42.240]  they cover isaia hamit's story when a swat team literally raided the home unconstitutionally and
[34:42.240 --> 34:48.400]  shot the place up murdering isaia hamit literally going in with automatic weapons and shooting the
[34:48.400 --> 34:53.200]  house up and then planting evidence and then even their statements say yeah well we don't really know
[34:53.200 --> 35:02.480]  wow but no coverage of this no marches nothing on cnn but then this x cop and lamar smith gets
[35:02.480 --> 35:07.920]  all the coverage why because lamar smith was black and they know that they can use this
[35:07.920 --> 35:13.840]  propaganda to virtue signal and to get black people out on the streets angry and upset and
[35:13.840 --> 35:19.280]  that's what they're doing so let's show some of these example examples first let's start off with
[35:19.280 --> 35:24.960]  of how they vaguely set the foundation this is cnn commentator calling for the removal of
[35:24.960 --> 35:31.600]  washington and jefferson statutes you saw the interview i did with um of course it was trying
[35:31.600 --> 35:36.800]  to run for a senate seat there in virginia and he makes the case that it is about i'm not trying
[35:36.800 --> 35:40.720]  to be mean it's just this woman is a nitwit philosophically and intellectually that we have
[35:40.720 --> 35:45.040]  to get to the heart of the problem oh don't get me started on angela rye just cut my mic i'll get
[35:45.040 --> 35:51.600]  too upset american history american history is not all glorious and even though i left john to death
[35:51.600 --> 35:56.400]  i couldn't disagree more about george washington george washington was a slave owner and we need
[35:56.400 --> 36:00.880]  to call slave owners out for what they are whether we think they were protecting american freedom or
[36:00.880 --> 36:06.400]  not he wasn't protecting my freedom just pause it right there just pause it right there listen
[36:06.400 --> 36:11.680]  angela rye if it wasn't for george washington freedom wouldn't even exist in this country
[36:11.680 --> 36:16.800]  and she's gonna sit here and bitch about how history isn't taught right and she doesn't even
[36:16.800 --> 36:22.480]  understand that it wasn't for george washington and the founding fathers freedom as we know it
[36:22.480 --> 36:29.760]  wouldn't exist go ahead with angela rye we weren't deemed human beings to him and so to me i don't
[36:29.760 --> 36:35.280]  care if it's a washington statue or a tomas jefferson statue or a robert e lee statue they all
[36:35.280 --> 36:40.080]  need to come down there is a way that we can recognize and i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm not
[36:40.080 --> 36:45.760]  this woman needs to be she needs to come down but i'm not but i'm not but i'm not but i'm not
[36:45.760 --> 36:50.480]  johnna i'm gonna i'm gonna finish my point i'm going to finish my point i'm not feeding into white
[36:50.480 --> 36:55.440]  supremacy i'm calling out white supremacy for what it is and sometimes what it is john as she's
[36:55.440 --> 37:00.160]  on a network owned by a white guy and has an opinion acknowledging that this country was built upon
[37:00.160 --> 37:05.520]  a very loudest one up there that resulted in death and the raping and the killing of my ancestors
[37:05.520 --> 37:10.320]  so i'm not going to i'm not going to allow your ancestors that sold your ancestors into slavery
[37:10.320 --> 37:15.440]  again she doesn't even know history call it what it is and i'm not saying that they don't deserve
[37:15.440 --> 37:19.440]  to be taught about we definitely need to learn about it so that we don't repeat it because we're
[37:19.440 --> 37:23.760]  very close to revealing it right now but i'm not giving any difference to george washington
[37:23.760 --> 37:28.320]  or to robert e lee let me let me jump in with the move then move why don't you move back to
[37:28.320 --> 37:33.440]  africa then if it's so bad here go back to africa it's not gonna happen there is no cnn there to
[37:33.440 --> 37:40.240]  give you a high paying job angela rye just sickening that woman makes me sick here's another cnn commentator
[37:40.240 --> 37:45.280]  calling trump a white supremacist these people are just liars man not only is donald trump a
[37:45.280 --> 37:50.640]  white supremacist sympathizer i think he identifies with this notion of white supremacy this notion
[37:50.640 --> 37:58.720]  of preservation of white culture and does that make him a white supremacist yeah does that
[37:58.720 --> 38:03.520]  essentially make him a racist okay i absolutely believe so and i've been hesitant to say that
[38:03.520 --> 38:08.080]  because i think words matter words are really important and i don't like to throw the word
[38:08.080 --> 38:12.080]  racist around i don't like to throw lots of different kind of words like that around and so
[38:12.080 --> 38:16.320]  today i'm at the point much like the guess you just had that the president of the united states
[38:16.320 --> 38:23.840]  is a racist and we have put a white supremacist in the white house okay great yeah so so now you
[38:23.840 --> 38:31.840]  understand why black people are so upset in this country because cnn is telling them to be cnn is
[38:31.840 --> 38:36.800]  telling them this country is racist cnn is telling them this country has kept them down cnn is telling
[38:36.800 --> 38:43.680]  them that they have not been free in this country all lies and then we've got another clip of cnn
[38:43.680 --> 38:48.240]  cutting off a black trump supporter because he rejects white guilt but this is it folks
[38:48.240 --> 38:54.400]  you want to know why these protests happen cnn selective coverage you want to know why
[38:54.400 --> 39:00.880]  the propaganda gets out there and people buy it cnn is feeding it to them so look no further
[39:00.880 --> 39:07.280]  than angela rye and samon sanders and cnn when you see rioting looting and protesting in your
[39:07.280 --> 39:14.240]  streets that's who's to blame because they go on air lie about history and lie about current day
[39:14.240 --> 39:19.760]  events i'm sorry that i scream and yell about angela rye she's just out of control so let's go now
[39:19.760 --> 39:26.800]  this is a breaking report this is from alex jones a cia whistleblower is going public on the deep
[39:26.800 --> 39:34.720]  state coup to remove president trump here's that report from alex jones a shadowy government with
[39:34.720 --> 39:44.960]  his own air force his own navy his own fundraising mechanism and the ability to pursue his own ideas
[39:44.960 --> 39:52.080]  of the national interest free from all sex and balances and free from the law itself
[39:56.640 --> 40:04.400]  nearing the 1970s senator frank church held the church committee hearings where decades of secret
[40:04.400 --> 40:11.920]  clandestine deep state operations were made public to the world from mind control of small
[40:11.920 --> 40:18.480]  kidnapped children in america to government narcotics trafficking to the structure of the
[40:18.480 --> 40:24.720]  deep permanent secret government itself a lot of incredible revelations came out then during the
[40:24.720 --> 40:32.480]  iran contra hearings of the 1980s even more came out as a young researcher i began to look into
[40:32.480 --> 40:38.000]  this information in the early 1990s and became somewhat of a history buff on it that's why it's
[40:38.000 --> 40:44.640]  been very frustrating for me who is informed from the congressional record to cover this information
[40:44.640 --> 40:50.320]  and have controlled corporate media in many cases working directly for the deep state
[40:50.880 --> 40:58.400]  lie to the public and tell you that i'm fake news well ladies and gentlemen we now have a high level
[40:58.400 --> 41:05.040]  cia whistleblower who's gone public and given a lengthy speech detailing the very structure of
[41:05.040 --> 41:12.080]  the shadow government which controls the ever-expanding deep state kevin ship worked for more than two
[41:12.080 --> 41:17.520]  decades at the highest level of the central intelligence agency and some of the most secretive
[41:17.520 --> 41:23.200]  projects in the last decade he's been quietly working with the former technical director of
[41:23.200 --> 41:29.840]  the national security agency william benney to bring out legally what they can without violating
[41:29.840 --> 41:35.760]  the so-called national security laws that the deep state uses via the shadow government and the
[41:35.760 --> 41:43.040]  controlled corporate press to keep the american people in the dark kevin ship recently spoke
[41:43.040 --> 41:50.080]  live to a crowd at a geoengineering conference of scientists and press zero hedge transcribed
[41:50.080 --> 41:55.440]  much of the video that's posted on info wars dot com as well as zero hedge dot com but in the
[41:55.440 --> 42:01.520]  interest of brevity let me simply read from the transcript from zero hedge then i'm going to give
[42:01.520 --> 42:07.360]  you the rest of the story coming up here in a few minutes about what the goals of the shadow
[42:07.360 --> 42:14.480]  government actually are from the article high ranking cia agent blows whistle on deep state
[42:14.480 --> 42:20.720]  shadow government nsa and cia at the top of the shadow government apparatus zero hedge
[42:20.720 --> 42:30.480]  september 16 2017 and here we are covering it now live on the 18th a cia whistleblower kevin ship
[42:30.480 --> 42:36.720]  has emerged from the wolves den to expose the deep state and the shadow government which he calls
[42:36.720 --> 42:43.280]  two entirely separate entities and again the reason this is so important is he says there's a civil
[42:43.280 --> 42:49.760]  war in the deep state trying to alert the public to how the shadow government controls the deep
[42:49.760 --> 42:56.400]  state the deep state's not the enemy it was established after nuclear weapons were developed
[42:56.400 --> 43:01.040]  so that in case the main government got wiped out there was a backup but special interests have
[43:01.040 --> 43:07.520]  used the transference of power to the deep state to again set up a parallel government that's
[43:07.520 --> 43:12.080]  operating outside the american people's control and which operates directly against the american
[43:12.080 --> 43:18.000]  people let me get back to the article from high level cia whistleblower ship's speech the shadow
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.200]  government controls the deep state and manipulates our elected government behind the scenes ship
[43:23.200 --> 43:28.320]  warned in a recent talk in the geoengineering watch dot org conference ship had a series of
[43:28.320 --> 43:33.600]  slides explaining how the deep state and shadow government functions as well as the horrific
[43:33.600 --> 43:39.840]  crimes they are committing against us citizens some of the revelations the former cia anti-terrorism
[43:39.840 --> 43:45.920]  counter intelligence officer revealed included that google earth was set up through the national
[43:45.920 --> 43:53.040]  geospatial intelligence agency and in cutel indeed he is correct the cia and nga owned
[43:53.040 --> 43:59.120]  the company google acquired keyhole ink paying an undisclosed sum for the company to turn its tech
[43:59.120 --> 44:05.600]  into what we now know as google earth another curious investor in keyhole ink was none other
[44:05.600 --> 44:12.000]  than venture capital firm in cutel run by the cia according to a press release at the time
[44:14.160 --> 44:19.680]  but of course it was in cutel money that helped found google in the beginning as well
[44:19.680 --> 44:25.280]  this is the controlled deployment of secret government technologies to the public with
[44:25.280 --> 44:32.720]  backdoor trojan horses for global control ship also disclosed that the agency known as the joint
[44:32.720 --> 44:40.480]  special ops command is the president's secret army which he can use for secret assassinations
[44:40.480 --> 44:45.520]  overturning governments and things the american people don't know about and that really first
[44:45.520 --> 44:51.680]  started with delta force in 1979 but now is expanded out into an entire sprawling complex
[44:51.680 --> 44:57.600]  and it's not just the army but other branches of the military fbi warrantless searches violate the
[44:57.600 --> 45:02.320]  fourth amendment with national security letters which ship noted enables them to walk into your
[45:02.320 --> 45:08.480]  employer's office and demand all your financial records and if he or she says anything about them
[45:08.480 --> 45:15.200]  being there they can put your supervisor in jail or drop a case against themselves using the state's
[45:15.200 --> 45:20.960]  secret privilege law now here's where it gets really important the top of the shadow government
[45:20.960 --> 45:27.040]  is the national security agency and the central intelligence agency ship said ship expressed
[45:27.040 --> 45:32.160]  that the cia was created through the council on foreign relations with no congressional approval
[45:32.160 --> 45:38.240]  and historically the cfr is also tied into the mainstream media he elaborated that the cia was
[45:38.240 --> 45:43.840]  the quote central node of the shadow government and controlled all of the other 16 intelligence
[45:43.840 --> 45:50.320]  agencies despite the existence of the d and i the agency also controls defense and intelligence
[45:50.320 --> 45:55.520]  contractors to manipulate the president and political decisions has the power to start wars
[45:55.520 --> 46:03.360]  torture initiate coups and commit false flag attacks he said as ship stated the cia was created
[46:03.360 --> 46:08.640]  through executive order by then-president harry truman by signing the national security act
[46:08.640 --> 46:16.480]  of 1947 then the shadow government began to absorb the legitimate government and parlay
[46:16.480 --> 46:24.320]  american power into global domination my words not ships continuing with ship the deep state
[46:24.320 --> 46:29.680]  is comprised the military industrial complex intelligence contractors defense contractors
[46:29.680 --> 46:35.360]  m i c lobbyist wall street offshore accounts fellow reserve imf world bank treasury foreign
[46:35.360 --> 46:41.600]  lobbyist and central banks but what is their ideology i'm going to get to that the rest of
[46:41.600 --> 46:48.480]  the story in the shocking explosive presentation ship went on to express that there are over 10
[46:48.480 --> 46:55.200]  thousand secret sites in the united states that formed after 9 11 there are 1291 secret
[46:55.200 --> 47:01.680]  government agencies 1,931 large private corporations and over 4,800,000 americans
[47:01.680 --> 47:08.560]  that he knows of who have a security clearance and over 824,000 who have top secret clearance
[47:08.560 --> 47:14.720]  explaining why they signed their lives away bound by an agreement he also detailed how congress
[47:14.720 --> 47:19.120]  is owned by the military industrial complex through the congressional arm services committee
[47:19.120 --> 47:25.200]  48 senior members of congress giving those members money and returned for a vote on the
[47:25.200 --> 47:31.840]  spending bill for the military and intelligence budget he even touched on what he called the
[47:31.840 --> 47:37.520]  quote secret intelligence industrial complex which he called the center of the shadow government
[47:37.520 --> 47:44.960]  including cia nsa nro and nga ship further stated that around the secret intelligence
[47:44.960 --> 47:49.280]  industrial complex you have the big five conglomerate of intelligence contractors
[47:50.080 --> 47:59.920]  ledos holdings c s r a c a c i s a i c and booze alan hamilton he noted that the work they do is
[47:59.920 --> 48:04.800]  top secret and unreported the whistleblower remarked that these intelligence contractors
[48:04.800 --> 48:09.920]  are accountable to no one including congress echoing the words of senator daniel inoway
[48:09.920 --> 48:14.720]  when he himself blew the whistle on the shadow government during the iran contra hearings in
[48:14.720 --> 48:23.920]  1987 let's go to a clip from that a shadowy government with his own air force his own navy
[48:25.120 --> 48:31.920]  his own fundraising mechanism and the ability to pursue his own ideas of the national interest
[48:31.920 --> 48:40.640]  free from all checks and balances and free from the law itself so who is ship is he credible
[48:40.640 --> 48:45.360]  is he who he says he is and the answer is is we're about to cover absolutely ladies and
[48:45.360 --> 48:50.640]  gentlemen he is one of the highest level cia whistleblowers we've ever seen and he gives us
[48:50.640 --> 48:56.800]  again another window into even how the people high level in the system are being abused used and
[48:56.800 --> 49:03.200]  controlled this is what aim dot org wrote about ship ship held several high level positions of the
[49:03.200 --> 49:07.840]  cia he was assigned as a protective agent for the director of the central intelligence agency
[49:07.840 --> 49:12.960]  a counterintelligence investigator a counterterrorism center staff a team leader protecting sensitive
[49:12.960 --> 49:19.600]  ci assets from assassination a manager of high ranking protective operations a lead instructor
[49:19.600 --> 49:25.200]  for members of the allied governments an internal staff security investigator and a polygraph examiner
[49:25.200 --> 49:30.480]  he was tasked with protecting the cia from foreign agent penetration and the chief of
[49:30.480 --> 49:35.760]  training for the cia federal police force mr ship functioned as a program manager for the
[49:35.760 --> 49:40.480]  department of state diplomatic security and anti-terrorism assistance global policing training
[49:40.480 --> 49:45.920]  program he is a recipient of two cia meritorious unit citations three exceptional performance
[49:45.920 --> 49:51.200]  awards and a medallion of overseas covert operations he is the author of from the company
[49:51.200 --> 49:57.120]  of shadows cia operations and the war on terrorism is this the beginning of more whistleblowers
[49:57.120 --> 50:03.840]  coming forward to end the shadow government and deep state you can watch ships full explosive
[50:03.840 --> 50:11.760]  presentation below at zero hedge dot com or news wars dot com and now as paul harvey would say let
[50:11.760 --> 50:17.680]  me in brevity give you the rest of the story and remember everything i'm going to break down
[50:17.680 --> 50:24.080]  everything i'm going to talk about is actually hiding in plain view the shadow state would love
[50:24.080 --> 50:29.040]  you to believe that everything you're doing is invincible and all powerful when really it's
[50:29.040 --> 50:34.960]  a bunch of different special interests that have established a new form of royalty for themselves
[50:34.960 --> 50:40.960]  so they can operate above the law in many cases for their own interest and what they're really
[50:40.960 --> 50:47.280]  trying to do is take control of human development and control the future and use america's
[50:47.280 --> 50:56.000]  incredible ingenuity inventiveness and strength and will to project that power out into the world
[50:56.000 --> 51:04.640]  to establish the first corporate planetary government whose ends is to carry out a worldwide
[51:04.640 --> 51:11.200]  eugenics program against the population but i want to be clear the so-called deep state
[51:11.200 --> 51:17.440]  state is made up of our military it's made up of anybody that's signed any type of confidentiality
[51:17.440 --> 51:22.560]  forms that works for major corporations that do government work a large part of our country is
[51:22.560 --> 51:28.880]  involved in this so-called shadow system which was established again to defeat the soviet union
[51:28.880 --> 51:35.520]  and to survive a nuclear war so many of the people involved in the shadow government are not bad
[51:35.520 --> 51:41.920]  people many people involved in the deep state are not bad people but it's critical to understand
[51:41.920 --> 51:50.560]  that the people that have burrowed in and gotten control of the shadow government are in control
[51:50.560 --> 52:00.240]  of the deep state and thus our taxes our regulations our nation our direction and so if you ask why
[52:00.240 --> 52:06.320]  is the media lockstep anti-family anti-christian pro-islamic why is the media for open borders
[52:06.320 --> 52:11.680]  why is the media for globalism why is the media attacking marriage why is the media attacking
[52:11.680 --> 52:18.000]  men and women why is the media promoting race war why is the media promoting hollywood garbage
[52:18.000 --> 52:25.040]  and it's because the people that craved power and the people that got control of the national
[52:25.040 --> 52:33.360]  security state from the moment it was born in 1947 are very wicked controlling twisted
[52:34.720 --> 52:41.680]  souls who more than anything lust after power and control and as we know
[52:42.880 --> 52:47.920]  the ultimate form of control is abusing and hurting or even killing small children and that's why
[52:47.920 --> 52:52.720]  from the deep state that controls the Vatican to the deep state that controls our major
[52:52.720 --> 53:01.200]  intelligence agencies to congress you see perpetual occultism pedophilia and bizarre behavior
[53:01.200 --> 53:06.640]  because as we read in history books power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely
[53:06.640 --> 53:12.960]  and these elites have been out of control forever believing they're above the law doing things so
[53:12.960 --> 53:19.600]  evil and corrupt that like psychopaths who don't get caught tend to get more and more reckless
[53:19.600 --> 53:24.480]  they've gotten more and more reckless and are now basically trying to get caught they're begging
[53:24.480 --> 53:31.360]  all of us to stop them control freaks want to run your life and to do that they've got to
[53:31.360 --> 53:36.720]  build an artificial environment they've got to take your resources and build their breakaway
[53:36.720 --> 53:42.960]  civilization so they can play god but they don't want you to have access to the life extension
[53:42.960 --> 53:47.680]  technologies they don't want you to have access to the quantum computing they don't want you to
[53:47.680 --> 53:54.560]  have access to the ai because if you had access to that you would be a competitor to them so the
[53:54.560 --> 53:59.920]  deep state's greatest crime is that they've deployed technology to the american people
[53:59.920 --> 54:05.920]  and to people of other nations but only with backdoors in it that surveil us and control us
[54:05.920 --> 54:13.200]  and let them know our hopes and dreams so they can manipulate us the deep state has a goal to
[54:13.200 --> 54:20.480]  dehumanize and reduce world population from between 80 and 90 percent their documents are public
[54:21.360 --> 54:26.960]  and they are carrying out covert operations where they are adding sterilants and where they are
[54:26.960 --> 54:33.600]  adding cancer viruses and other slow kill and soft kill weapons to the vaccines fluoride added
[54:33.600 --> 54:39.680]  1947 was a national security act the nazis and the communist russians had done it to lower fertility
[54:39.680 --> 54:47.200]  and lower IQ keeping iodine out of the food supply also about reducing population and their argument
[54:47.200 --> 54:53.040]  is if you're dumb enough to not know you need this you deserve what's happening to you ladies and
[54:53.040 --> 54:58.400]  gentlemen they've stolen the future special interests have gone in set up a secret government
[54:58.400 --> 55:05.200]  and they've broken away and the hope here is that there are good people inside the deep state
[55:05.200 --> 55:10.640]  not many inside the shadow government who know that this is evil and now they've gotten further
[55:10.640 --> 55:14.480]  enough down the line to know that enough pieces of the puzzle have been put together because
[55:14.480 --> 55:19.760]  their compartmentalized as well to understand the end game is global government and global
[55:19.760 --> 55:27.760]  exterminism and an anti god anti family hell so because they understand the end game is corrupt
[55:27.760 --> 55:34.080]  they're fighting back they're leaking information they're speaking out and they supported donald
[55:34.080 --> 55:40.000]  trump because it was believed he wanted americana he wanted prosperity he wanted god guts and guns
[55:40.000 --> 55:45.520]  again not the socialist hell that the globalists are trying to push and to a great extent trump
[55:45.520 --> 55:51.920]  has delivered so far but he's being pulled in and surrounded by the swamp that covers power more
[55:51.920 --> 55:57.760]  than anything else that's why it's important for us to devolve power from the globalist systems
[55:57.760 --> 56:04.800]  systems from the big box stores from the new order operations to our own towns our own cities
[56:04.800 --> 56:11.120]  our own schools our own businesses and to rediscover what americana is and to say no to
[56:11.120 --> 56:17.520]  the globalist that would steal the future and to understand they've used the secrecy to establish
[56:17.520 --> 56:24.240]  a system that if they used it to empower humanity would take us to the stars but instead is trying
[56:24.240 --> 56:31.520]  to kill the west and kill the very renaissance that was so powerful it gave birth to the technologies
[56:32.160 --> 56:38.240]  that have allowed many of these globalists to basically have the control and foresight and
[56:38.240 --> 56:44.720]  knowledge of demigods ladies and gentlemen now more than ever it's critical for you to make a
[56:44.720 --> 56:49.040]  decision about the facts we presented here and to understand the reason i've been demonized and
[56:49.040 --> 56:53.440]  attacked and made fun of everywhere is because they think you're weak-minded and they don't want you
[56:53.440 --> 56:59.360]  to pay attention to what i've been saying for 22 years the truth is we've been dead on because
[56:59.360 --> 57:04.400]  we're going to the source white paper documents where the globalists have arrogantly been communicating
[57:04.400 --> 57:12.080]  in public about this plan the truth is i'm dead on and the truth is i'm still alive because of you
[57:12.080 --> 57:17.360]  supporting me and many people in the deep state that are patriots that understand the truth so
[57:17.360 --> 57:21.920]  the evil globalists are afraid to kill me because it might turn me into a martyr or they might get
[57:21.920 --> 57:27.920]  caught we're in the middle of a civil war deciding the future destiny of this republic
[57:27.920 --> 57:33.200]  and the world and people making jokes about this or people not paying attention or folks
[57:33.200 --> 57:38.480]  deciding they don't matter so just let somebody else handle it is what has put us in the position
[57:38.480 --> 57:45.280]  of almost being technotronic technocracy slaves let's continue with what our ancestors did and
[57:45.280 --> 57:50.480]  stand up for what's right let's focus on being engaged and informed and let's turn this world
[57:50.480 --> 57:55.680]  around because as thomas jefferson said the only thing on evil men in tyranny to flourish is that
[57:55.680 --> 58:00.720]  good men and women do nothing and the truth is the tide is turning history's happening and it's
[58:00.720 --> 58:07.120]  because of you the info warriors that this planet has a shot of being free that's not hype it's the
[58:07.120 --> 58:12.000]  truth the globalists know you're the most awake informed people out there they know you're the

[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:08.240]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming to you live from the
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:22.160]  front lines of the info war well i'm waiting for angela rye and simone sanders of cnn isis news
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:30.000]  to report on chicago homicides there've been over 500 homicides in 2017 and those are stats back
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:38.640]  from april so who knows what that number is now but it's really sad to me sure is it harder for
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:43.520]  some black people in this country absolutely no one's trying to argue that we're trying to argue
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:47.040]  the reasons we're trying to get down to the bottom of it and we're trying to point out that the people
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:54.400]  virtue signaling over this are trying to incite civil war and race bait you they never talk about
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:01:00.320]  the cia plan to end the family which has hit the black hole more than anything they never talked
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:07.520]  about the mtv propaganda used to destroy black culture and make it all about being a gangster
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:13.680]  and then now that's what you have and that's what you see out on the streets but nobody talks about
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:18.880]  that it's all about white supremacy even though it was george washington and thomas jefferson
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:23.840]  that laid the foundations of independence and freedom not just for us here in the west but
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:28.960]  worldwide that's why it's called the shot heard around the world but they don't do their history
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:33.280]  research they don't tell you anything about that so we'll all be waiting for angela rye and
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:38.240]  Simone sanders to report on the black on black murders going on in chicago but they won't do that
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:43.120]  because they can't virtue signal and they can't race base over that so it's just really ironic
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:49.520]  that the people here Simone sanders angela rye the list goes on and on that are telling you
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:54.480]  that you're a victim telling black people you're a victim putting them in that victim state which
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:02:00.560]  then cripples them for life so angela rye and Simone sanders cripple black people for life
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:07.600]  telling them they're a victim and then the the actual progenitors of the oppression of black
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:12.320]  people that they claim to be calling out and helping so how do you like that angela rye and
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:18.080]  Simone sanders are oppressing black people by making them victims and becoming progenitors of
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:24.560]  the CIA agenda to end the family and to make black people rely on welfare so there's the truth
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:31.520]  that angela rye and Simone sanders of icis or excuse me cnn won't tell you now here's a clip of cnn
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:36.800]  cutting off a black trump supporter as he completely destroys their concept of white guilt
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:43.760]  exactly how he operates and why he does what he does it's he's playing 3d chess you know i've seen
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:48.320]  some shirts here today though i think one shirt cnn the checkers news network kill things like that
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:52.640]  i mean there there've been some messages that might not be that open uh to folks from different
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.240]  diverse perspectives i mean what we've been reporting that trump is racist how are you
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:02.480]  liking him um i i agree with that i actually just made a post about it on my page in a video about it
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:09.440]  is that um there is there are some white americans that feel guilty for what their ancestors did
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:14.160]  you know this and that and the thing about it is they shouldn't have to feel guilty this is america
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:22.160]  and just let me correct myself boris that was actually deon and they cut him off he's uh
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:27.600]  the founder of the conservative black uh foundation uh he was one of the many african american
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:32.800]  speakers that spoke today at this rally an effort by this group how is this possible cnn told them
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:36.720]  trump is racist i can't believe it there's no doubt the majority of people that were here were
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:42.240]  certainly white but we did see a cross-section of americans and the goal here was to get out
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:47.840]  of this situation peacefully and they were alright now let's go again to a video of st louis protesters
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:55.200]  in the street chanting stop killing us this is part of the protest in st louis is outside the
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:02.720]  police headquarters i believe that's in clayton the audio not so good on this if you're a tv
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:09.040]  viewer at info wars dot com slash show you can see it of course i'm from st louis i've had friends
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.680]  that have been updating me on this situation it's very sad these are actually liberal friends democrat
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:17.520]  voters of mine that say this is tearing the country apart and they can't believe this is happening
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:25.120]  so but here's what you have so the cnn reporters go out they tell black people they're victims but
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:29.680]  they don't really tell you what's going on they virtue signal these people and make them victims
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:33.760]  oppressing them more and then send them out into the streets where then they're confronted by the
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:38.960]  police because they're acting violently chanting to kill police and then cnn takes that and again
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:45.440]  uses that to victimize black people this is the propaganda circle that we're seeing from fake news
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:51.440]  don't go anywhere more the alex joneshow including the complete collapse of the failed emmy's last
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:57.120]  night i didn't watch them i don't know what happened we hold these truths to be self-evident
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:02.240]  that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:07.520]  rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:13.120]  governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.760]  that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:26.080]  people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government independence isn't a day it's a
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:31.760]  mindset an attitude that says i will not be your dependent i will not be your slave dependence
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:38.000]  and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements when you trade
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:45.040]  your liberty for safety to that extent you become their slave slaves are never safe you won't get
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:51.520]  rich by being a slave guard your liberty regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it

[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:51.680]  night i know america didn't care and didn't notice and so they had to do something to grab the attention
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:56.640]  so they cried about trump for the entire uh production that's what they do i mean they
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:02.320]  got to get attention somehow nobody cares about these people anymore emmies devolve into three hour

[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:43.600]  dumb that ignorant or do they genuinely want to see race baiting do they generally want to see
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:50.000]  civil war i mean they're telling these people you're justified to go out and loot you're justified
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:58.400]  to go out and riot okay john oliver apparently wins an award for variety even though he has the
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:04.720]  stalest show ever it's the same thing every night the same thing everyone else is doing bash trump
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:10.400]  how does he win an award for variety oh because that's how the enemies work you don't win an award
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:15.280]  for being original you don't win an award for being creative you don't win an award for dominating
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:21.680]  other programs you win an award for bashing trump john oliver bashed trump the hardest
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:29.280]  so he gets the award that's how it works me's tv review donald trump overkill stain
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:37.920]  steven colbert's hosting debut that's right steven colbert we want you to use your nightly show to
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:44.160]  bash president trump if you do that we'll give you the role of hosting the emmy's colbert
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:50.400]  gladly goes along emmy's devolves into three-hour celebrity anti-trump rage fest just goes on and
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:56.160]  on here emmy's ratings hit record low in early numbers yeah people care less and less about them
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:02.480]  so that's why they're more desperate to try to be the center of attention emmy's so black why issa
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:08.640]  ray's comment wasn't racist and then in this story from news one they say uh black people can't be
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:14.400]  racist so that's actually i guess kind of racist in and of itself emmy's knives out for trump as
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:18.960]  steven colbert attacks potis an opening monologue so let's go to this video clip this is a compilation
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:25.920]  of the opening monologue bashing trump this is supposed to be about celebrating you know greatness

[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:37.120]  to bash american greatness bash a president that actually cares about this country this is the

[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:19.200]  your support for the beautiful stepway let me take over i can make us some halfway i love television
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:26.160]  it's a pleasant distraction but just imagine taking action i like Brooklyn 99 in fact i'm addicted
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:30.800]  but with the cops show when one gets convicted i miss the classic class don't think that's
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:39.600]  uh so again then chance the rapper says why aren't these cops getting convicted more people
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:45.520]  go out and write and loot and chant and protest which there might be some legitimacy to that
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:51.520]  year it has been for television i mean the industry is booming there are over 450 original
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:55.760]  the industry is booming because of trump of course there's no way anyone could possibly
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:00.480]  watch that much tv other than the president who seems to have a lot of time for that sort of thing
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:04.640]  can we just pause it right there just pause it right there yeah yeah trump is about to meet
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:10.160]  in 13 different states to cut taxes he's meeting all week this week with un leaders
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:14.080]  he's already met with Netanyahu he's giving a speech tomorrow he gives at least three four
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:19.200]  five speeches a week sometimes multiple speeches a day literally on the phone all day working around
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:27.360]  the clock and then this piece of television garbage comes out and has the nerve to say
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:36.080]  that trump is lazy and doesn't work he just watches tv so untrue such an assault on reality
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:44.960]  that it belongs in 1984 let's go ahead joining us looking forward to the tweets i'm just so ready
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:49.920]  for these people to just be gone just gone with ourselves and as artists i think we have to be
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:57.040]  honest with ourselves we know the biggest tv star of the last year is donald trump yeah
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.720]  no you're not like it he's the biggest star in the history of the world literally in the history
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:08.800]  of the world obviously you know they're all mad oh my gosh trump is kicking our ass what are we
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:14.000]  gonna do you guys are neck and neck america hates us alec you're up against a lot of neck
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:22.080]  and however you feel about the president and you do feel about the president you can't deny that
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:26.480]  every show was influenced by donald trump in some way all the late night shows obviously
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:32.000]  house of cards the new season of american horror story and of course yeah did you see that
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:39.280]  latin grammy is hosted by sheriff joe arpaio hey pause it for a second the opening show
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:44.480]  for america horror stories was about people that didn't vote for trump freaking out and literally
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:52.000]  having a mental breakdown like steven colbert is right here go ahead and we all know the emmies
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.920]  mean a lot to donald trump because he was nominated multiple times for celebrity apprentice but he never
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:05.360]  won why didn't you give him an emmy i tell you this if he had one an emmy i love this i bet he
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:13.360]  wouldn't have run for president so in a way this is all your fault what what i thought you people
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:18.560]  loved more you guys just be funny heroes you know what happened to try to be funny white
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:29.440]  he's just walter much wider a bunch of peeled out celebrities laugh he never will the president has
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:35.280]  complained repeatedly that the emmies are rigged no duh like that's what i'm saying here pause real
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:42.080]  quick like he says something like oh the president is so outrageous he says the emmies are rigged
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:49.200]  hey dumbass most of america knows the emmies are rigged like this isn't new that's like he
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:53.440]  that's what i'm saying these people don't understand they literally think either everyone is as dumb
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:58.240]  as they are and as ignorant as they are or they really just assume america is completely ignorant
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:05.680]  like president trump says the grass is green colbert did you see trump he said grass was green
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:12.320]  oh my gosh let's go back to the genius steven colbert went after the host a few years back tweeting
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:21.040]  that seth mires is hosting the emmy awards is a total joke he is very awkward with almost no talent
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:27.600]  marbles in his mouth i can do a better trope impression than colbert okay he gave it a good
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:32.400]  effort but he's not that good that's why he didn't win the emmy okay he's upset about the emmies right
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:38.320]  here any response seth maybe if he would have won the emmy he wouldn't be complaining about trump
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:44.400]  maybe if he did an original show and didn't spend his entire show bashing trump maybe
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:48.720]  then he could win an emmy so steven you might want to blame yourself and your riders because
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:54.640]  they can't make an original joke it's all about trump trump would not let it go this actually
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:17:00.400]  happened see here he is again he can't let go of trump folks he can't let go there was even a time
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:05.920]  when he didn't get an emmy for his tv program three years in a row and he started tweeting
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:14.240]  that the emmies were rigged again that endears trump to his base that endears trump to the
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:20.160]  american people they don't get it they are so high off their own ignorance their own flatulence
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:29.440]  they probably but he didn't because unlike the presidency emmies go to the winner of the popular
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:44.000]  vote is she crying people are crying over over non-funny jokes where do i find the courage
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:52.720]  to tell that joke in this room of course what really matters to donald trump is ratings he
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:58.080]  got to have the big numbers and i certainly hope we achieve that that's not what he cares about
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:03.680]  otherwise he'd try to do a funny show of knowing how big our audience is hmm is there anyone who
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:12.960]  could say how big the audience is sean do you know here comes sean spicer apparently now he
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:20.080]  hates the president true uh too oh my god we got spicer now this will be the largest audience
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:31.760]  to witness an emmy's period both in person and around the world wow that really soothes my fragile
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:36.560]  ego remember how they used to hate spicer and rip spicer now all of a sudden they love him
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:44.640]  listen to carfi everybody give it up all right so that's good now let's go to this clip of some

[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.680]  what they say you know what they think so i want to know do you think that they're that stupid are
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:09.360]  they are i mean are they genuinely that stupid do they really not understand what trump is and
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:14.240]  what he's doing and what the trump movement is are they that do they just hate america that much
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:19.200]  or are they that bought and paid for are they that blackmailed what do you think is going on
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:26.240]  we're going to hear from you on the other side uh but you know i'm sitting here and i'm looking
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:32.640]  at all of these stacks of news i have now this is this is actually from friday but this just
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:37.920]  just shows you the nature of what they're thinking from the new york times the big question as the
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:45.280]  un gathers what to make of trump so again it's not about radical islamic terror that continues
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:51.840]  to hit europe continues to hit the west continues to grow it's not about that it's not about kim
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:59.440]  jung un flying bombs over japan testing hydrogen bombs threatening the united states no neither of
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:05.360]  those are the big issues according to the un that is meeting this week it's trump you know why it's
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:12.000]  trump folks because the un has been working towards ending american dominance ending american
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:18.400]  greatness you see america cannot be independent for the globalists to exist america cannot thrive
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:24.960]  independently for the new world order and the globalists to continue to reign supreme so that's
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:30.240]  why the un is upset with trump trump is trying to make america strong which will end the new world
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:35.120]  order globalist regime that's why they have to stop trump you better understand that because
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:40.960]  that's everything right now trump is pro america if america returns and america is independent
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:47.840]  and america sovereign the new world order dies we're on the march the empires on the run alex
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:57.920]  jones and the gcn radio network starch anti federalist patrick kenry was opposed to the
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:02.000]  constitution fearing it would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:06.320]  states that had created it but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:11.600]  his warnings ignored have now come to pass he said you're not to inquire how your trade may
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:17.200]  be increased nor how you were to become a great and powerful people but how your liberties can be
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:22.000]  secured for liberty ought to be the direct end of your government patrick kenry warned us the
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.120]  liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:32.560]  may be concealed from them today everything the government does at every level is concealed
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:37.200]  from us we have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:42.000]  allowed to see later in life patrick kenry looked back and said when the american spirit was in its
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.920]  youth the language of america was different liberty sir was the primary object today our primary
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:54.320]  concern is safety and comfort when we should be demanding liberty grandfather wars dot com i'm david

[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:05.040]  and in the last four or five years doing more and more research i came across the fact that the
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:11.040]  elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:17.360]  better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:22.720]  they were hunting killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:30.000]  just have concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood ingredients known for
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:36.080]  cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time info wars isn't just fighting the globalist

[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:29.920]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from austin texas broadcasting
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:38.800]  worldwide it's alex john you know i'm just trying to put things in perspective here as i'm reading
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:43.600]  all the stories about what happened in st louis they're expecting more riots tonight i'm seeing
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:50.160]  the mainstream news cover it they're they're burning buildings they're looting buildings we
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:55.600]  saw what happened in ferguson we've seen other things that happened when all of these charges
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:00.160]  either get dropped the acquittals happen there's always protests there's always riding there's
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:05.520]  always looting but for some reason we're just supposed to accept it it's just supposed to be
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:10.160]  acceptable and we're just supposed to say okay that's just how it goes and it's okay for angela rye
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:16.960]  and samones sanders and bernie sanders and all of these people don lemon anderson cooper to go on
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:23.920]  television and to tell you you're justified america is racist it's run by white supremacists so go out
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:29.360]  and loot go out and protest go out and riot and burn things down and that's okay the cops are going
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:34.320]  to allow it because there's nothing they can do and they don't want to be called racist because of
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:40.960]  course we know that america's racist but i'm just trying to put things in perspective imagine
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:47.680]  if i came on the air or if alex jones came on the air and said when obama was president
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:52.880]  we've got a black president so we need white people to go out and and protest and then that
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:57.920]  turned into rioting and looting and arson and all this stuff you know that all they would talk about
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:03.120]  is how alex jones incites riots and how alex jones is anti-american now they do that anyway even
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:10.320]  though he does none of that but these people get to go on air incite riots incite race wars lie
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:15.600]  about the president to do both of the previous things i mentioned and it's just radio silence
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:25.840]  it's you know i don't know what the answer is to to stopping this except people being arrested
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:31.680]  unfortunately and i don't know what that really entails people were arrested in st louis 80 arrests
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:37.680]  last night in st louis yet they're expecting more today so maybe arresting them won't do it
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:44.480]  i don't know what you do if cnn gives continues to give platforms to loudmouth liars racepaders
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:48.640]  like angela rye what i mean what are we supposed to do other than just turn them off how do we stop
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:53.680]  this propaganda from infecting our youth but the question that i also want to ask as we go to the
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:36:02.720]  calls now are people like angela rye samon sanders steven colbert jennifer lorence robert deniro the
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:07.120]  list goes on and on and on are all these people in hollywood all these people in the mainstream news
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:14.000]  are these people that dumb that ignorant do they hate america that much or are they genuinely
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.080]  bought and paid for or just a hundred percent blackmailed that's what i want to hear from our
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:24.000]  audience because it's just it's just out of control let's start with jacob in kansas he's got
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:31.360]  emmy's on his mind go ahead jacob yeah my name is jacob from kansas how you doing or doing well
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:38.800]  great well um i think that the uh worshiping of false idols has been a long-standing tradition
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:45.200]  since the advent of the television and the radio but it brings it brings the the worshiping of the
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:50.240]  false idols to a bigger picture that for example with the advent of the printing press it could be
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:57.200]  used to destroy society or to help society to spread propaganda or to spread information that
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:03.120]  can raise people's intelligence you see what i'm saying yeah absolutely just like any technology
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:09.760]  it could be used for good or evil that's right and that goes to show you the uh examples that we see
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:14.960]  with these folks in st louis and other parts of our country they're tearing down what we built
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:22.320]  what we what we put together brick by brick store by store to help blossom the the the
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:26.960]  the capitalistic part of our country but you see on the other hand i can understand the
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:32.880]  frustration from the negative propaganda coming through the television tube coming from the radio
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:38.240]  and coming from the mind control music that we listen to these folks we have a problem with
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:44.480]  our education system and we have a problem with um indoctrinating our kids instead of helping them
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:51.280]  become educated and learning the real history and so you know it's not just one issue with the fact
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:58.320]  that uh hollywood is all bad there are some good patriotic hollywood stars yeah yeah you'll notice
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:02.720]  people like matthew mcconaughey are now regulated to doing tv commercials why do you think that is
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:10.720]  folks exactly yeah point well made but the other side of the token is you have a lot of these folks
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:17.520]  that are disillusioned propagandized indoctrinated in hollywood and what we have happening these
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:22.400]  people are also medicated by many different kinds of drugs that have taken over hollywood that's a
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:27.840]  great point when you mix the propaganda with the drugs you have people that are running the muck
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:34.400]  destroying the very country that we spent all these years building and it just seems like now
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:40.640]  there's this this bash trump campaign and there's no end to it i see it every day every day you know on
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:46.640]  the news here i watch the mainstream mind wash news uh on a daily basis to look at the trash to see
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:52.240]  you know what what they're peddling to you know all of us and it makes me sick to my stomach um
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:39:01.040]  but here's here's another situation that we need to um i help um make come about in this country
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:05.680]  is the fact that we need to start coming up with solutions i love the show i love everything
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:10.800]  what it's about the patriotism americanism so forth but we need to have like a solution hour
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:16.480]  an hour of people coming up instead of complaining about the winers let's start coming up with
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:21.680]  solutions let's come on up let's start coming up with uh new policies new new ways we can bring
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:25.600]  people so he makes a great point and i want to and i want to hold it right there because i want to
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:30.800]  kind of delve into uh some of the things he said first of all he talks about the education system
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:36.720]  absolutely the education system is failing a lot of these schools that produce these these kids at
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:42.960]  least at a younger age can't get the funding they need they have to cut programs the teachers don't
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:47.680]  care because they don't get paid enough and it's just and honestly it's just a terrible cycle
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:53.920]  that you just continue to go down um you know i was trying to help uh inner city school in
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:58.400]  st louis that's struggling with stuff like that and they just don't get any help from the city
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:01.680]  they don't get any help from their local leaders they don't get any help from the government
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:07.280]  because they can't get the funds they need that's why we need to go towards the privatization of
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:13.280]  schools okay that's where really higher education exists now you're not getting that in any public
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:17.680]  schools we can go on on that for a while and then you talk about the propaganda that's being fed to
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:25.680]  them and it's just like you know they don't know any better and you talk about solutions that's why
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:31.360]  info wars exist that's why we are here doing this show because we want to be a solution we want to
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:36.240]  counter the fake news we want to inject different ideas we want to inject different realities that
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:41.440]  actually resonate with the average individual because they think instinctually just like we
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:46.640]  do because we're not peddling someone else's propaganda and then you know he mentions how
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:53.280]  they go out and they loot and everything here's the sad part about that they don't care about society
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:59.200]  they they've been told their entire lives that society hasn't given them anything so that society
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:03.680]  owes them something even though in this country society owes you nothing you're independent you
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:09.520]  build your own life your own future your own destiny that's why america is great but see
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:13.760]  they've been lied to thinking that society owes them something so then they're not getting what
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:19.040]  they want out of society so then they hate society they've never given anything to society so then
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:23.360]  they have no problem going out on the streets burning looting pillaging and protesting and
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:28.000]  rioting because this is the society that owes them so much that's given them nothing and then
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.120]  they have samon sanders angela rye bernie sanders you know nance pelosi maxine waters the list goes
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:39.520]  on and on and on justifying them empowering them saying yes you have the right to be upset you
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:45.680]  have the right to riot you've been oppressed you're a victim when it's them that are actually making
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:51.280]  them victims and oppressing them and again this goes on and on and then he brings up drugs another
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:56.960]  excellent point most of these hollywood stars are so peeled out of their minds they probably
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:03.120]  can't even think clearly and that's just a layman's explanation that we know is going on who else
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:10.320]  knows what goes on behind closed doors in hollywood we know they don't come out and make a political
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:15.280]  statement because that's how they think or feel it's because they want to get the next role and
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:21.760]  now you have jennifer lorence who just made a complete ass of herself twice a the movie completely
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:26.480]  flopped b she doesn't interview about the movie that flopped and decides to bash trump and blame
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:31.520]  global warming and hurricanes on trump she's a complete miserable failure now she's apparently
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:39.360]  going to quit acting because nobody likes her anymore they don't get it see they're all obsessed
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:44.960]  with money they're all obsessed with popularity they're all obsessed with the spotlight so they
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:53.120]  sell everything out to obtain the fake the fake acceptance of hollywood the fake
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:01.680]  dramatization the fake heroics of hollywood all fake they sell out everything to be put in the
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:07.840]  fake life of hollywood in the fake film industry and then they they take a step back and they
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:14.320]  realize wow america actually hates me wow nobody watches my films wow i'm a complete jackass and
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:17.680]  then people like jennifer lorence who i already said i don't think she's that dumb i think she
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:23.200]  said that's get a next movie role now she realizes nobody watches my movies nobody likes me now i'm
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:28.720]  making myself out to be a jackass i need to take a step back and rethink things so maybe we'll see
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:34.320]  more of hollywood do that as far as solutions go we put in president trump we always have to vote
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:41.280]  we hope that president trump is the one we thought he was the next big solution to me at least voting
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:48.640]  wise is the 2018 midterms if we can get a congress a president a judicial branch an executive
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:54.560]  branch a legislative branch that are all pro america put america first that is the biggest
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:59.680]  solution we can have to the overarching problem which is the globalist trying to end america
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:08.080]  but most solutions that the average listener needs to engage on are in local government
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:13.840]  and just literally in your own house you know getting the air filters from infowarstore.com
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:19.360]  getting the water filters stop eating the gmos stop shopping at the big agencies that are
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:26.400]  anti-american so most of that as far as solutions go start right at home raising your kids the right
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:30.960]  way actually raising your kids not letting the state raise your kids or the television raise
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:36.400]  your kids so these are all solutions that are really homegrown let's go to donnie in organ
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:43.200]  go ahead donnie hey thanks for having me oh and this is donnie tsunami the psychological
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:50.240]  arsonist and i love that you laid out a bunch of brush in front of me uh you set me up beautifully
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:56.800]  here it's all fake and and the important part here is the bernese and bastards who are writing
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:02.960]  this script there's a reason they went crazy because they know we can rewrite this script
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:10.320]  but it comes back to those solutions unity unity starts with you and i and without you there is
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:17.680]  no resistance without you there is no we the people that's on you that's on me we have to step it up
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:21.920]  completely agree with that i think we're starting to see that happen
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:29.760]  absolutely and you know that's one of the most important things we can do at this point is get
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:36.480]  people to actually read especially the dictionary gerald solente once issued a challenge to get
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:43.360]  a dictionary that was worth a damn but you have to get a pretty old one for that i have a 1937
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:50.000]  on a bridge lebster's dictionary and the thing weighs like 25 pounds it's huge where'd all the
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:56.640]  words go well i'm not sure if expanding our lexicon is the solution to all of our problems but
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:03.280]  certainly educating yourself reading history knowing history that's one thing that the globalists
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:08.560]  that the media and that that fake politicians always use against the brainwash masses is the
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:15.840]  fact that they don't know their history so then they're up there on the platform presenting history
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:21.680]  as they want it presented or as they see it which 99 percent of it is untrue thank you for the call
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:31.040]  donnie let's go to david in california go ahead david hello hi hi hi i love the show

[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:49.680]  not see germany and the way these people are acting and i i just i i think they
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:56.960]  they must be under some kind of mind control or possessed by yeah you know it's almost as if
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:04.720]  no no no hold on a second it's almost as if think about it like this hillary clinton
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:09.920]  was the hitlerian candidate hillary clinton was the one that represented hitler and just
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:16.480]  like germany in the late you know 30s was really into hitler and he and you know in the 30s he was
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:21.760]  really you know he got into power because he was germany first you know selling the germans
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:26.720]  virtue signaling on how germany's are victims blah blah so he gets into power that's basically
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:34.160]  what hillary clinton would have been essentially except virtue signaling for the entire world
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:40.560]  that america's the bad guy so they were all sold already on hitlery they were all already sold
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:48.160]  on hitlery hitlery was already put into power you know 98 99 chance hitlery wins so they were
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:53.920]  already given their hitler they were already given their hateful leader and then america said no
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:48:01.520]  and and removed her so that's also why they're totally freaking out go ahead that's scary i'm
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:07.120]  sorry for using the n word but all right well we didn't hear that but i'm gonna have to take

[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:42.160]  is over the lovely house 24 30 um i really believe that the nsa uh is uh responsible for a lot of
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:47.920]  the pedophilia that goes on in uh hollywood have you ever heard of a guy named michael akeano

[01:48:55.200 --> 01:49:02.800]  was a guy that uh alex jones interviewed named uh senator john de camp years ago he wrote the
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:09.760]  franklin coverup and uh john de camp won a million dollar uh judgment for paul benossey who was
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:15.440]  brought up to bohemian grove where alex jones infiltrated and filmed it might add and paul
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:20.720]  benossey was made into a snuff film there and and to camp one there was still overwhelming evidence
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:26.960]  for him uh that john de camper wrote the franklin coverup won a million dollars for paul benossey
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:33.440]  and paul benossey says he was also taken up into the house of the former head of uh michael akeano

[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:50.160]  ty cobb i always kind of felt like he was going to be uh in charge of some big hits if you will
[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:56.640]  and ironically ty cobb was victimized by fake news over a hundred years ago calling him a racist
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:01.680]  that's the baseball player of course so i'm just throwing that weird history out let's go back to
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:06.000]  the college before i completely lose it let's go to alicia in organ go ahead alicia
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:15.680]  hi elin hi can you hear me uh okay um i was just gonna say you know your first caller i don't
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:20.880]  know he's got like a vulcan mind meld or whatever but he he pretty much crystallized what my call
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:28.560]  was going to be about about how you know i heard this on um the uh steven crowder broadcast
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:35.600]  i believe this was the last week about but basically we need to be more active culturally
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:41.760]  because that's where we're gonna make the biggest impact i mean i know we like oh republicans
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:47.360]  historically they've always been you know the ones that have these you know kind of stuffy
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:51.920]  publications you know that's how they make well do you think we're not do you think we're not fighting
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:55.840]  the culture war hard enough i think we're taking back culture pretty pretty swiftly here i mean
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:59.360]  it's not going to happen overnight but i think we're dominating the culture war right now
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:06.720]  i think that we are learning i think we're doing a good job but i think that we can do more i mean
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:11.360]  look at the emmies i mean the emmings rate emmy ratings completely tanked hollywood is completely
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:17.840]  tanking i mean those are victories of course they are of course and that's where we're seeing a lot
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:23.680]  of the victory and that's why i think that generation z to all the studies i've seen
[01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:29.920]  they're going to be the most conservative generation it's since the 1940s but we got to keep at it we
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:36.480]  can't uh we can't just you know let loose again because i mean the reason why things are so bad
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:41.120]  right now is because we allowed them to get this bad and we can't make that same mistake again
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:47.440]  no i totally hear you and a lot of that is because we've been uh completely separated from god
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:52.560]  worshiping false idols and our children have no idea who god is thank you for the call alisha

[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:10.640]  all right we've got some breaking news right now on social media and free speech
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:17.680]  the monopolies that run the internet ghettos are trying to silence their competition so we'll have
[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:24.080]  news on that in a second but first here's a video of a feminist protest gone wrong well you shouldn't
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:32.880]  have protested at a muslim event so there's the feminists they take their tops off and they are
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:39.520]  now taking over a muslim event grabbing the mic frothing at the mouth feminists holding their
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:46.240]  fists in the air and now here come the muslims in charge of the event they take her they drag her
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:50.080]  offstage now they've got her on the ground and there it goes they are brutally beating her
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:55.600]  now she's getting pummeled and kicked and beaten to a bloody pulp at the muslim event
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:04.640]  so feminist protestor protest a muslim event actually makes sense the religion of islam
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:09.360]  that oppresses women in a lot of these islamic countries women can't drive they have no rights
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:12.800]  they can't even leave the house they can't without their hood over their head they can't even leave
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:18.800]  the house without a man or they can be arrested or raped or thrown in jail so i give these feminist
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:25.760]  credit they go out there and they protest oppressive islam against women and then they
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:31.520]  learn the hard way how oppressive islam really is against women as they get beaten to a bloody
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:38.800]  pulp but you won't see any of the liberal media covering that will you nothing nothing because
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:44.400]  islam is the religion of peace as they blow people up all over europe and beat a feminist
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:51.520]  protester okay so now here's the breaking news this is from jamie white at info wars.com google
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:57.920]  tech giants threatened to shut down free speech social site search engine giant google and other
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:02.640]  tech platforms that threaten to shut down free speech social media site gab in the name of fighting
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:08.160]  hate speech so gab is now considered hate speech even though it's nothing but free speech the hill
[02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:13.680]  alt right twitter rival may lose its web domain so boom they try to label it alt right which
[02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:19.600]  they've already labeled as racist white supremacist totally false google faces lawsuit over removing
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:27.120]  gab from play store so there you go now google is censoring the content that you have access to
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:36.160]  that's stasi techniques that's hitlerian techniques and so here was a report from fox
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:42.400]  talking about the hypocrisy on the social media giants they claim they're diverse but it's not
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:47.600]  true here's that clip and you know ashley facebook loves painting itself as this forward
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:53.520]  sinking progressive and inclusive company right one look at facebook's own workforce and you're
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:58.640]  slapped in the face with hypocrisy only three percent of the company's employees are african-american
[02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:03.280]  only five percent are hispanic so if you're going to facebook want a lecture that's another good
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:10.160]  point you know inclusion they should practice what they preach yes oh my gosh how dare fox report
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:15.360]  the truth about facebook and google they claim they're diverse claim they're for minorities
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:20.960]  bunch of bull and the only reason why they support docka is so they can bring in cheap labor
[02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:27.920]  this is actually this is this is amazing so andrew torba he is the creator of gab he's
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:33.760]  going to be on the alex joneshow with alex jones tomorrow to cover all of this but again we've
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:38.640]  been telling you that this is coming and you know what we've had callers call in and talk about
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:44.960]  taking action here's how you can take action go out download gab go get gab right now go create a
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:52.480]  gab account go invest in gab they want to remove gab obviously gab is where we need to go see gab
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:04:00.800]  gab is set up to directly compete with twitter so you can't have that because you see twitter
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:05.360]  is one of these internet ghettos that controls your free speech we've seen it they've kicked
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:11.600]  milo off they've kicked a ton of people off and they keep responses from getting to president
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:16.560]  trump they'll censor responses they'll censor don juniors tweets they're censored president
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:23.360]  trump's tweets they'll remove people if they don't like their opinion so you got all of this going on
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:30.400]  and it's just an example of how they're trying to skirt the first amendment by putting everyone
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:35.040]  onto these free speech plantations that are actually not free speech and then censoring
[02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:41.200]  everything you see there so that's what's actually going on that's the real censorship those are the
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:45.520]  real people that hate free speech it's the people at google the people at facebook and the people
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:52.960]  at twitter that want to shut down any competition they have think you know someone very profoundly

[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:10.160]  you've got the un meaning this week trump is at the top of their agenda not radical islam
[02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:16.800]  not north korea trump will speak tomorrow how about this but meanwhile though the media is
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:21.760]  triggered by trump tweeting a video of him hitting a golf ball the media is pissed off that trump
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:27.440]  donated a million dollars uh to hurricane relief the left can't handle that the left can't handle
[02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:31.120]  the fact that president trump is kicking ass the left can't handle the fact that we're winning the
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:36.320]  culture war so they just spread lies and disinformation six dreamers sue trump administration
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:43.600]  over dakka decision from news trust dot org this has to be the most ironic news story i've ever read
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:50.880]  so first of all they haven't even made a decision on dakka except to leave it in the hands of congress
[02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:58.560]  so the entire notion of this lawsuit is frivolous but let's not forget dakka was obama's bill
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:07.520]  why are you suing trump trump is going to help you don't you get it i mean my goodness people are
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:15.120]  just so just what do you call it i mean seriously what do you call it what do you call someone that
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:23.200]  doesn't live in reality what do you call someone that acts impulsively on something that doesn't
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:32.080]  exist it's like beyond a phobia it's like their entire life is a phobia so trump sticking up for
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:38.000]  dakka i think he's actually going to make these people's citizens hands it over to congress
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:42.960]  obama created this mess all the past presidents created this mess by not enforcing the law at the
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:48.080]  border and then it's all trump's fault and they're going to sue trump even though he hasn't even done
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:56.480]  anything yet honestly it's impossible to cover this it it's so outrageous it's so non-existent
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:15:01.920]  in reality that how do you even cover this except just to say here's what's going on
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:07.920]  here's the liberal madness here's the mental disorder here's how fake news propagandizes
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:13.920]  people wow and then you have this washington post writer says trump is killing him literally
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:18.880]  dana millbank a writer for the washington compost believes president trump is literally killing him
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:26.720]  he says president trump is killing me no really he's killing me and then you have
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:32.640]  american horror story a popular series on fx they do their opening show about the trump
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:37.440]  derangement syndrome and how hillary clinton voters literally have gone mentally insane
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:43.600]  insane hillary clinton voter hillary clinton voters and trump detractors have literally gone
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:51.360]  mentally insane so think about that think about that you have at least 50 million people in this
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:58.560]  country that are mentally insane and they don't even know it yet and no one has actually put them
[02:15:58.560 --> 02:16:02.960]  into the category of mentally insane where they probably belong in a straight jacket in a rubber
[02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:10.400]  room so we'll just continue to deal with the absolute madness that are these people yeah i
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:16.240]  actually watched the opening episode because i heard about it it is very accurate and you
[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:20.400]  have people that literally have mental breakdowns because trump won all right let's go back out
[02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:30.800]  to the phone lines let's go to jerry in florida go ahead jerry hi hi can you hear me okay hey um
[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:37.440]  it real quick before i get on a roll here i want to thank the lineman from texas who came to florida
[02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:44.560]  to uh to pull our bacon out of the fire i can't thank those guys enough everywhere i looked texas
[02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:51.280]  plate okay wow so you're talking about people coming together uh in times of tragedy wow absolutely
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:58.240]  yeah and i just i just really and i sincerely mean it i want to thank those guys um but uh
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:03.440]  solutions um you said that uh when liberal progressives go grab microphones that uh
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:10.800]  that uh it's a muslim events and they end up they end up getting their heads beat in well then
[02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:15.920]  i think info wars and all of the new media should spend a great deal of their time promoting these
[02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:21.680]  events for liberal progressives to go to problem solved well the problem is in america the problem
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:27.040]  is in america they've allied with one another so yeah but if you but if that yeah but if you keep
[02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:31.600]  sending enough of them and they keep getting their heads beat in then you know it goes to zero so
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:38.720]  well that's that's how a logical mind would work uh however as i just said we're dealing with people
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:45.600]  that have literally gone mentally insane right which brings me to my final point here i was watching
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:52.080]  a uh i this this was as close to eighties as i ever want to be i spent the afternoon with my wife
[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:57.680]  watching a chick flake yesterday to pass time because uh we were just you know happy to have
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:02.960]  the air conditioning back on finally and they on lifetime i think was the network they had a
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:09.040]  program and it was called uh something like flowers in the attic where uh it was about two
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:13.760]  children that a crazy mother had locked in an attic for like three years and the brother and
[02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:21.440]  sister became incestuous and then stemming from that as they grew it was every combination of
[02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:27.760]  totally screwed up relationship in that family that you could ever think of and of course they
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:36.160]  they normalized the brother and sister uh uh marriage because they were liberal and but the
[02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:44.160]  one uh quote unquote son uh there were two but uh one of them was like purely evil and and he was
[02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:52.400]  very religious and they he was a course conservative well um it was funny to watch the psychology
[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:58.080]  going on in this thing and then here comes the kicker every commercial that they would go to
[02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:06.320]  was about anti-depressant drugs haha oh it was just it was a sight to behold wow it was fun to watch
[02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:12.080]  see and that's why i love taking calls because you guys put the strings together that we forget
[02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:18.160]  yeah look at the country look at the percentage of people that are on anti-depressant drugs
[02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:22.560]  look at the side effects of these drugs look at the opioid crisis look at what's happened in

[02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:35.600]  independent because they're a bunch of communists and they're all in debt and their infrastructure
[02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:41.120]  is failing so they just kind of skirt that and they virtue signal and say we're a sanctuary city

[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:09.520]  completely out of their minds they don't know what's going on they can't even barely tie their

[02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:59.600]  so you can't so they're just going to rename everything now i guess they're going to rename
[02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:03.600]  everything named after the rebels you can't have a team named after the indians you can't have the
[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:08.400]  redskins even though nobody cares except white liberals so literally the people that aren't
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:14.320]  even victimized by this are the only ones that care yale swaps out freshman and upper classmen
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:19.200]  with gender gender neutral terms well that'll be nice i mean you know we might as well confuse
[02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:24.000]  we should confuse the students you know let's get them really confused chicago you know 500
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:28.080]  homicide that's from a few months ago so it's probably up more than that it's just again
[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:33.520]  all these people protest white supremacy they don't protest any of the black on black crimes that
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:38.720]  happen in chicago washington post writer says trump is literally killing him okay dania millbank has
[02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:43.920]  completely gone insane belongs in a mental institution and feminist protest a muslim event
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:49.680]  and then get beaten to a bloody pulp linus arsaur nowhere to be found let's go back out to the phone
[02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:56.400]  lines let's go to james in illinois go ahead james reading some flyover country ellen um i
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:27:00.800]  definitely want to say that i love the show and i appreciate everything you guys do but let me get
[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:06.560]  to the nidgit of the gritties i think the ultimate thing that the uh shambling abomination of an
[02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:12.720]  awards show showed us last night is that being praised by people like that is really like an
[02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:18.240]  insult and when we voted in trump we didn't vote in a god emperor that was going to come and
[02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:24.000]  decapitate the dragon we voted in someone who is going to be a strong actor because he was a strong
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:31.040]  actor he's playing a role he's letting everybody look at him shine nothing but a light on all the
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:35.280]  corruption around him how many names do we now know to not trust because of who he's associated
[02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:40.000]  with and then distance himself yeah the trump test yeah i would have never known the shorn
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:45.280]  spicer was kind of a a yellow belly but i seem like he kind of is so the ultimate thing that i
[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:51.440]  think we can derive from it is that while he's there doing what we did being where he wants
[02:27:51.440 --> 02:27:58.240]  to be and where we put him we need to be all up in the ass of the 218 elections because that is
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:02.800]  where actual momentum can be gained i'm not sure if i agree with your phrasing but i agree with the
[02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:09.520]  idea i'm excited about these midterms they're way i haven't been in a long time i think people
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:15.920]  like that's just like the election yeah dr sheba going up against pocahontas all the mean magic
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:24.960]  that helps trump in 2016 needs to be reinvested man i'm telling you james if we if we get elizabeth
[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:30.400]  waran out if we get nancy pelosi well pelosi i guess she'll be back if we get maxine waters out
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:35.360]  debbie washerman schultz out i mean these are the true swamp creatures barbie herself these are the
[02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:42.800]  true people that hate america elizabeth waran a total phony a total fraud a piece of political trash
[02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:49.600]  that belongs in the incinerator i completely agree my final statement is that as casini
[02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:54.720]  winds its way through the cosmos back home it shows us that draining the swamp isn't about
[02:28:54.720 --> 02:28:59.840]  trump alone that going and taking things out it's about him sinking into the swamp and showing it
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:06.320]  to us like casini or any space probe going through a vaporeous atmosphere of jupiter that's what we
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:10.800]  need to remember and that's what we need to put our energies it's the trump test no you're 100
[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:17.600]  right it's the trump test and just by existing trump has forced the deep state to show itself
[02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:22.560]  trump has forced the anti-american politicians to show their face trump has forced hollywood to
[02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:27.440]  show its true nature absolutely and we should thank president trump for that he is an american
[02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:34.240]  president don't go anywhere folks alex jones is on the other side
[02:29:39.920 --> 02:29:46.640]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:51.520 --> 02:29:57.040]  joe bakes here with info wars dot com today i want to talk to you about guns why we have them
[02:29:57.040 --> 02:30:02.640]  why the bill of rights guarantees that we can have them and why my right to have a gun is more
[02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:08.160]  important than your right to rail against it in the press i believe every good journalist needs to
[02:30:08.160 --> 02:30:13.440]  know why the second amendment must be considered more essential than the first amendment this may
[02:30:13.440 --> 02:30:20.160]  be a bitter pill to swallow but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated dusty idea some
[02:30:20.160 --> 02:30:25.920]  old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the redcoats no it is just as essential to liberty
[02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:32.640]  today as it was in 1776 the original amendments we refer to as the bill of rights contained 10 of
[02:30:32.640 --> 02:30:38.720]  what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights the bill of rights came to us with blinders
[02:30:38.720 --> 02:30:45.120]  on it doesn't recognize color or class or wealth it protects not just the rights of actors or editors
[02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:51.360]  or reporters but extends even to those we love to hate this is a small excerpt from trawlton heston
[02:30:51.360 --> 02:30:56.000]  it's not just our water we need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned it's the air

[02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:28.480]  yaya faruka who was arrested saturday night for reportedly being responsible for planning
[02:33:28.480 --> 02:33:34.160]  the bombing that would have killed untold numbers of commuters and rush hour on friday
[02:33:34.720 --> 02:33:40.960]  if the improvised explosive device had properly detonated and of course he was a syrian refugee
[02:33:40.960 --> 02:33:48.880]  staying with another iraqi refugee and i love how he was 21 years old the other guys
[02:33:48.880 --> 02:33:55.120]  18 years old and they were calling them children a few years ago when they brought them into the
[02:33:55.120 --> 02:34:02.000]  uk and paid foster parents an elderly couple to house them and take care of them this is the
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:08.400]  sick joke just like obama said anybody who comes across the border is legal because i'm saying
[02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:13.040]  they're all children and we're going to take children in that are refugees it's all just a
[02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:18.800]  stunt just like the dreamer stuff all of it is to pull on our heartstrings of course there's some
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:24.480]  innocent people coming in who happen to be muslim of course there's some people that are dreamers
[02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:28.880]  that are great folks the point is no other country in the world allows stuff like this
[02:34:28.880 --> 02:34:35.120]  but the united states and now europe's doing it because the un and peter southerland admit
[02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:41.040]  it is about ending the sovereignty of the west and bringing in groups who'll then be racially
[02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:47.440]  and culturally and religiously hyped up to be told that they've been treated bad by the white
[02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:56.480]  minority that is the admitted plan turn on cnn turn on msnbc untold race baiting 24 7 now
[02:34:57.440 --> 02:35:02.000]  with dallas texas as trump and i and many others warned a few months ago we knew it was coming
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:09.520]  is set to start pulling down statues of thomas jefferson george washington and benjamin franklin
[02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:14.960]  again they don't call for pulling down statues in african countries of people that have slaves
[02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:20.960]  they don't know it's only about america and the west and about political bullying
[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:25.520]  and wherever democrats get control they do this and they've got republican cohorts that go along
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:30.480]  with it because the elite wants to distract people with the race baiting garbage but let's get back
[02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:37.920]  to islam it's not a race it's a political religion and you have these individuals that are brought in
[02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:43.760]  who think of themselves as heroes and they hate the brits that brought them in so much and kissed
[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:50.400]  their butts so much that they tried to kill 22 people they were only able to wound but i want to
[02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:57.200]  say this right now this latest london attack and the bomb they found on a train railway and all the
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:36:01.200]  acid attacks and all the stabbings and all the hammered attacks that happen every day in europe
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:05.760]  to the point that i can't even remember them all or keep track of them there's there's four or five
[02:36:05.760 --> 02:36:11.280]  events a day this is all a giant false flag now by false flag there's different types of false
[02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:17.440]  flags purely staged partially staged but also when you just enable the environment to happen
[02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:24.320]  as i've said many times if i bread up a hundred black widows in my basement black widow deadly
[02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:29.760]  spiders they can kill you and i went and dumped them in my neighbor's bed was i commanding the
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:36.000]  black widows were they following my orders or was i just bringing the black widows in
[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:41.600]  and dumping them in the bed knowing what they would do and that's what this is but this is a
[02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:46.320]  staged event where they bring in the islamist system they attack and then we're told we've got
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:52.480]  to give our rights up to them and then somehow they'll be nice to us they're trying to induct us
[02:36:52.480 --> 02:36:57.840]  into mass stockholm syndrome if logic was around they were bringing in these folks you'd think oh
[02:36:57.840 --> 02:37:01.280]  they're just doing it so they staged terror attacks then the government could take our rights
[02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:06.000]  then later scapegoat then and kick them out but that's not the plan and that's bad enough
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:11.680]  no they're bringing them here knowing they could induce us into stockholm syndrome to basically
[02:37:11.680 --> 02:37:18.320]  kiss the butt through hospital hospitality of modern radical orthodox islam like they're doing
[02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:21.520]  in sweden like they're doing in germany like they're doing in canada like they're doing in many
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:26.720]  areas of the united states this is the program taking kids to mosque teaching kids about muhammad
[02:37:26.720 --> 02:37:33.920]  having little girls wear hajjibs having cnn on every show stick women wearing hajjibs and msnbc
[02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:40.080]  that have footlocker and gap and i mean you go to the mall and it's just every storefront shows a
[02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:45.120]  woman in hajjib even though it's a tiny minority they're getting you ready for it to be a majority
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:50.000]  and that's their plan everywhere they build mosques they admit it's an area they've conquered
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:53.920]  just like they wanted to build one on the site of 9-eleven and i used to hear this stuff 10 years
[02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:58.560]  ago and roll my eyes because it was so unbelievable but now it's all confirmed to be true we have all
[02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:03.680]  the documents we have all the white papers we have all the big imams saying europe and america are
[02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:11.200]  weak go there take that women they're yours now haha yeah it's good chrome their girls and you sit
[02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:17.200]  there and you watch this and you watch linda source serve with her family hardcore terrorist
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:22.240]  admittedly in prison in the middle east and and all the things she's involved they won't take her
[02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:28.480]  her family in saudi arabia they know how dangerous they are they export them to us saudi arabia won't
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:33.120]  take one refugee but they sure finance the overthrow of syria and then all the refugees are people
[02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:38.240]  that they send in to take over then they send them in to take us over they breed this radical
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:44.400]  garbage in their madrasas in their mosque and then they export it as the weapons system outside of
[02:38:44.400 --> 02:38:49.920]  their countries it's a fact and the globalist are allied with it and it's sickeningly conscious
[02:38:50.480 --> 02:38:57.040]  hollywood is so dirt bagged so scum filled so anti god so anti family so anti christ they get
[02:38:57.040 --> 02:39:02.960]  off on this just like satanist get off on the lesting a child or get off on torturing a child
[02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:07.920]  the more obscene the more blasphemous the more evil the more out of control to take the west
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:13.120]  with all its virtue and all its openness and all its goodness and teach everyone to hate it and
[02:39:13.120 --> 02:39:18.320]  lie about it and then bring in incompatible stone age people that literally keep women as slaves
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:23.120]  and sold them as slave auctions and cut their genitals off and to turn it around have every
[02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:28.320]  major so-called liberal billionaire force feed this garbage cynically at us when none of them
[02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:33.920]  take refugees in and when they executed and funded google and others the entire arab spring it is the
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:38.320]  height of criminal activity you have to break with the globalists you have to break with the
[02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:44.800]  liberals and realize they are conscious criminals even low-level liberals now know that they're part
[02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:49.920]  of a criminal takeover and get offline you've seen the crowds everywhere we go the hatefulness
[02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:55.040]  their children cussing and screaming they even fight with each other they're this frothing trash
[02:39:55.040 --> 02:40:00.080]  they don't even work who just live here and feed off everything and then see the obscenity of
[02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:05.040]  orthodox islam being brought in and all its horrors and its acid attacks its enslavement
[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:10.160]  as a sign of the impending ugliness that they wish to spread it's time to get angry it's time
[02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:15.360]  to get focused it's time to look at story on info wars dot com that is unbelievable that just
[02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:21.280]  absolutely makes my blood boil even more this is what got me so mad it's one thing to have google
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:26.000]  facebook twitter and all these groups going and lobbying to be able to operate as monopolies
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:30.080]  and lobbying to have laws passed that they think they can censor and have immunity from censorship
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:36.240]  it's one thing for them to engage in all the selective uh discrimination as libertarians
[02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:41.600]  and conservatives and patriots but it's a whole nother thing when they start working with Saudi
[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:48.160]  Arabia and pakistan and iran you can look this up stories are on info wars dot com mainstream news
[02:40:48.160 --> 02:40:54.320]  links to it proudly reporting people for blasphemy saying you know i'm an atheist you know saving
[02:40:54.320 --> 02:41:00.560]  living a muslim country or whatever they come and kill you and google facebook and twitter are
[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:06.400]  working with them to do it and working with china to get entry into china and now they're helping
[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:17.680]  report mainline free uh social network sites they are now openly coming in and saying they are going
[02:41:17.680 --> 02:41:24.080]  to censor any alternative sites so it's one thing to say oh it's our site we own it so you can't be
[02:41:24.080 --> 02:41:27.440]  on here even though they've always said their utility and they operate for the public and
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:34.080]  they they discriminate still you could argue that in some weird world you cannot argue what
[02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:40.080]  they're doing now the stories on info wars dot com google tech giants threaten to shut down free
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:46.240]  speech social site so it's not enough that they're running oligopolies and monopolies and combines
[02:41:46.240 --> 02:41:52.880]  and trust it's not enough that they're violating the public trust no now they want the tech site
[02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:56.960]  the social media site based in austin texas i'm gonna get this guy into marie's been on before
[02:41:56.960 --> 02:42:02.240]  they're trying to get it shut down in countries like australia and the uk and other areas and
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:08.800]  they want to shut down here as well because they have free speech and let people say racist things
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:13.040]  and do racist things they also let folks counter them and say they're wrong because that's what
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:18.320]  america is remember that's what the west was you you may not like somebody's speech but you
[02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:22.880]  stand up for their speech because if they lose their speech you're going to lose your speech
[02:42:22.880 --> 02:42:28.160]  just like we're now seeing happening to jamie white article on info wars dot com google tech
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:32.880]  giants threaten to shut down free speech social site google has monopoly on flow of information
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:38.640]  search engine giant google and other tech platforms have threatened to shut down free
[02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:43.520]  speech social media site gab in the name of fighting hate speech gab a social media platform
[02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:48.880]  known as a free speech oasis was just recently ordered to transfer all their australian domain
[02:42:48.880 --> 02:42:54.240]  elsewhere or face shutdown gab's domain or register has given five days to transfer the
[02:42:54.240 --> 02:43:00.400]  domain or they will seize it the free and open web is in danger the website tweeted asia registry
[02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:06.480]  is poised to shut down the pro first amendment website because it claims gab violates australian
[02:43:06.480 --> 02:43:10.560]  federal and state anti-discrimination laws and see google and all them have worked to get these
[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:14.880]  laws passed that's that's what they get into which prohibit public vilification of the basis
[02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:20.880]  of race religion or ethnic origin so the nazis are a culture or an origin can't criticize them
[02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:25.760]  now see it's all selective and accuses the website of being discriminatory and hateful google has
[02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:31.520]  already booted gab off the google base store also citing violations of their hate speech policies
[02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:36.480]  which has promoted gab to sue the tech giant for violating antitrust laws oh i definitely want to
[02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:40.720]  get them on because this is serious google is the biggest threat to the free flow of information
[02:43:40.720 --> 02:43:46.160]  gab chief executive andrew torba said in a statement and so it just goes on and on what
[02:43:46.160 --> 02:43:51.520]  they're doing they are deplatforming everybody and all these mainline conservatives uh that that
[02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:55.600]  go along with it and think they're part of the structure all these people that you know sit there
[02:43:55.600 --> 02:43:59.920]  and uh side with this because they think it'll get them boosted with the globalist kind of like
[02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:05.920]  glenn beck has done your idiots they'll eat you last fools they'll throw you overboard for sure
[02:44:05.920 --> 02:44:10.320]  though for lowering the drawbridge now i'm going to go back to oh and shroyer and his transmission

[02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:48.880]  absolutely putting them into fits because they're losing culturally but this is their counter offensive
[02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:54.160]  so we've got to beat them financially as well big sales are about to end i've got to end the

[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:18.640]  the new specials and i did come in on sunday but i got busy shooting other special reports so the
[02:45:18.640 --> 02:45:24.000]  reason a bunch of specials are still on today is because i haven't come out with the new specials

[02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:26.800]  than ever dhs report fines sneaking across the us border for mexico is tougher than ever before
[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:32.320]  and us agents are catching or stopping the majority of those who attempt to do so so again this is why
[02:46:32.320 --> 02:46:38.320]  i've never been a big proponent of the wall not saying a wall doesn't help but we can do this
[02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:43.680]  just by boots on the ground and by more than anything actually following the law that's what
[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:49.840]  we need to do first follow the law and arrest people who illegally cross the border don't just
[02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:54.000]  let them come in with free handouts that's what we've been doing we get a president in there that
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:47:00.320]  follows the law allows ice and dhs to do their job and then what do you know the washington compost
[02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:08.160]  has to report border security tougher than ever according to dhs of course again the wall doesn't
[02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:15.120]  hurt hungry builds a wall cuts illegal immigration by 99 percent that's right that's why liberals
[02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:22.800]  build walls outside their huge mansions so while obama has a wall to keep the riff raff out
[02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:30.640]  state department considers closing embassy in cuba after diplomats suffer mystery illness
[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:36.880]  so tillerson is considering to close an embassy in havana where a bunch of diplomats mysteriously
[02:47:37.600 --> 02:47:45.040]  got sick at least 21 americans here's some uh ongoing news about the world war that's building
[02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:52.720]  usb 1b supersonic bombers conduct joint drill with south korea as a warning to pyongyang
[02:47:52.720 --> 02:48:00.480]  so russia's doing drills usa's doing drills north korea's doing drills everyone's doing
[02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:07.360]  drills north korea's nuclear tests could spark a volcanic eruption you know that's another thing
[02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:14.240]  as i'm about to cover another climate change story all these liberals that want to complain
[02:48:14.240 --> 02:48:21.360]  about climate change all day long do they ever bring up nuclear bomb testing there've been like
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:28.560]  thousands of nuclear bombs detonated across the entire planet over the last 30 years complete
[02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:36.080]  radio silence they don't complain once about kim jong-un testing a a hydrogen bomb they don't
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:42.240]  complain once about kim jong-un completely testing nuclear bombs all the time america does it too
[02:48:42.240 --> 02:48:47.200]  everyone does it they all test nuclear bombs nobody complains nobody complains about the
[02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:52.560]  nuclear bomb testing nobody complains about the geoengineering it's how dare you drive a car
[02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:57.680]  how dare you have electricity how dare you be such a glutton and want to have air conditioning
[02:48:58.640 --> 02:49:04.720]  no that's to bring you down that's to handicap you to keep you from having a destiny to keep you
[02:49:04.720 --> 02:49:10.560]  from having a future to keep you from being free to oppress you so all the liberals out there
[02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:15.760]  that say climate change climate change when you do something about climate change go stop kim jong-un
[02:49:15.760 --> 02:49:22.560]  from testing a nuclear bomb every week and then come talk to me and so then ryan mawi writes the
[02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:27.200]  story for wall street journal basically saying hey all of you freaking out about hurricanes and
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:32.720]  climate change maybe you should get your facts right and he's basically saying all the hype
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:38.720]  doesn't help you're just building a straw man essentially without actually pointing to any
[02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:45.840]  data any evidence well that's because the data and the evidence points to not global warming
[02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:51.200]  that's why they had to change it from global warming to climate change meanwhile hurricane
[02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:59.600]  irma latest updates indicates possible similar path as irma this is hurricane maria hurricane marina
[02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:05.600]  maria excuse me but are we kind of like hurricane out is anyone really going to cover this like
[02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:11.760]  we have been are we like hurricane out now second man arrested over london bombing is a syrian
[02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:18.320]  refugee so the tube bomb the flame bomb that burned and scolded and and killed people second

[02:55:16.240 --> 02:55:24.320]  fourth hour here let's go to margaret in texas go ahead margaret hi i recently had a conversation
[02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:33.280]  with a woman whose uncle was former senator bob bennett of utah and they were very very close
[02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:41.760]  and bob bennett senator bob bennett told her that all the senators and congresspeople
[02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:50.480]  were already hunkered in well before the terrorist struck on 9 11 didn't hit the world well yeah
[02:55:50.480 --> 02:55:55.600]  wasn't it condoleezza rice who was told not to fly on 9 11 to there are a bunch of people that were
[02:55:55.600 --> 02:56:02.880]  told you know don't fly on this day we need to have a citizen's grand jury and rain in all
[02:56:02.880 --> 02:56:10.960]  those senators under oath and ask them where were you hours before the terrorist attack and what did
[02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:20.480]  you know because you start connecting the dots on no i mean i completely understand what you're
[02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:28.240]  saying i mean i mean here we've got the terrorist attacks then we've got the black muslim hail who's
[02:56:28.240 --> 02:56:36.240]  staying obama and now we've got all this racial division and if you google white woman with a
[02:56:36.240 --> 02:56:43.680]  baby you'll get the most bizarre searches oh yeah people are reporting on these google searches you
[02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:48.560]  search american inventors they don't show any white people uh you search american family they
[02:56:48.560 --> 02:56:54.240]  don't show any white people then you do the same search on bing or on duck duck go or on yahoo or
[02:56:54.240 --> 02:56:58.880]  some other search it shows you the real results not censored by google so google can try to uh
[02:56:58.880 --> 02:57:04.160]  to paint the optics of america that are totally inaccurate you know and margaret brings up 9
[02:57:04.160 --> 02:57:11.920]  11 i mean i don't know what we do folks i mean you think about it they got away with 9 11 whatever
[02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:16.560]  the truth is we still don't know they still have classified papers they still have the 21 pages that
[02:57:16.560 --> 02:57:22.880]  are classified uh what we do know is that you know they basically made us go to war with afghanistan
[02:57:22.880 --> 02:57:28.560]  and iraq even though all of the hijackers came from saudi arabia i mean the list of nonsense just
[02:57:28.560 --> 02:57:33.280]  goes on and on so i don't know what the answer is i mean we're going to continue to harp on the truth
[02:57:33.280 --> 02:57:38.400]  we're going to continue to fight for 9 11 truth and i think most people are starting to come around
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:44.160]  now as slowly more and more kind of leaks out and it just more and more doesn't make sense here
[02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:49.600]  almost 20 years later uh the way we've responded and it just goes on and on so i don't know if
[02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:54.640]  this is just a time bomb of 9 11 truth or if there's really anything we can do at this point
[02:57:54.640 --> 02:57:58.640]  thank you so much for the call margaret let's go to michael in florida go ahead michael
[02:58:02.720 --> 02:58:11.520]  what what yeah uh the thing is is that about what you said about the changing of our genetics
[02:58:11.520 --> 02:58:17.040]  i see i i have a feeling that that this current drug thing that's currently going on in china i
[02:58:17.040 --> 02:58:22.560]  think that's probably the beginning of a sort of effect of all right well i can't really understand
[02:58:22.560 --> 02:58:26.800]  you uh i'm not sure if you're screaming into your phone like i might be if i was upset about this but
[02:58:26.800 --> 02:58:31.280]  uh yeah they're trying to change our dna they're trying to rig our genetics they want to end the
[02:58:31.280 --> 02:58:35.840]  human species check out the georgia guide stones that's why they force you to vaccinate your kids

[02:58:46.240 --> 02:58:51.040]  has been called the iodine conspiracy i've told you about how scientists have known for decades
[02:58:51.040 --> 02:58:57.040]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate iq and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out
[02:58:57.040 --> 02:59:02.080]  of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they took the
[02:59:02.080 --> 02:59:07.920]  good halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the fukushima crisis worsened as it still is

[02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:19.600]  even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut which
[02:59:19.600 --> 02:59:25.440]  many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine you can pull
[02:59:25.440 --> 02:59:30.400]  these studies up for yourself this is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential

[03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:41.200]  one thing that that jumped out to me was when that that funny guy jumped on stage um i think
[03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:48.320]  his name is uh his name is on twitter at millennial underscore mat and he yelled hitler did nothing
[03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:54.240]  wrong i thought you know i thought that was really great and um you know it was it was it was a nice
[03:01:54.240 --> 03:02:00.080]  change of atmosphere you know because all these people up there you know all these all these jewish
[03:02:00.080 --> 03:02:06.480]  medians and actors you know uh they uh they've given us such a strange representation of our
[03:02:06.480 --> 03:02:12.240]  history and and and they want to tear it all down and and i i just can't help but
[03:02:12.240 --> 03:02:17.040]  agree with that man millennial matt on twitter i can't help but agree with him and you know
[03:02:17.040 --> 03:02:21.920]  say you know hitler did nothing i'm confused you're saying that adolf hitler did nothing wrong
[03:02:22.880 --> 03:02:26.720]  well that's what millennial matt did uh that twitter the famous twitter guy
[03:02:27.680 --> 03:02:33.760]  i don't understand the point well the point was you know i i i'm starting to agree with him
[03:02:33.760 --> 03:02:44.000]  man you're a holocaust denier uh i am a holocaust denier yes okay even though there's like so much
[03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:49.760]  evidence that the holocaust happened it's like absurd to deny it well you know the six million
[03:02:49.760 --> 03:02:53.840]  number is not real um you can argue about the six million number but that doesn't mean the
[03:02:53.840 --> 03:02:58.720]  holocaust didn't happen thank you for the call and i'm excuse me who's at matthew let's go to
[03:02:58.720 --> 03:03:09.600]  anton now in california go ahead anton hey this is uh anton hi how are you doing i'm doing good
[03:03:09.600 --> 03:03:18.480]  so uh the first thing i'd like to say is um i did some reporting for info wars myself and
[03:03:18.480 --> 03:03:26.000]  you can go to revolver um isis or revolver orbiter at twitter or you can go to the orbiter
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:34.000]  on youtube and the one with master in it and um i'd like to say yeah donald trump should probably
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:41.120]  get a bunch of people around him who can spook the cia spook the fbi spook all those people who have
[03:03:41.120 --> 03:03:48.960]  a lot of problems with um basically patriot like things i think if he can um if he can give people
[03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:54.800]  who will annoy these people enough when they're around him they won't be around him well you know
[03:03:54.800 --> 03:04:01.600]  what annoyance is a tactic of the marxist it's the tactic of the adjaprop i think that trump
[03:04:01.600 --> 03:04:07.600]  needs to continue to build a team of lawyers and go after these people legally you know they want to
[03:04:07.600 --> 03:04:13.840]  probe him to death why not probe them right back why not look into the cia running drugs across the
[03:04:13.840 --> 03:04:19.840]  border why not look into the cia and the fbi running cocaine and and the drug war and why not look
[03:04:19.840 --> 03:04:25.840]  into what the opium is doing that comes here from afghanistan i completely agree but i think you put
[03:04:25.840 --> 03:04:31.040]  sharks on these people like ty cop you don't try to annoy them you don't try to embarrass them you
[03:04:31.040 --> 03:04:36.880]  say you know what you're a criminal we're coming after you with the law you sob that's what i think
[03:04:36.880 --> 03:04:40.800]  trump should do continue to hire lawyers to attack these people right back give them a bit of their
[03:04:40.800 --> 03:04:50.720]  own medicine we'll be right back with jack vasovic don't go anywhere all the perplexities the confusion
[03:04:50.720 --> 03:04:56.000]  and distress in america arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation not from
[03:04:56.000 --> 03:05:01.520]  want of honor or virtue so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin credit
[03:05:01.520 --> 03:05:06.800]  and circulation those are the words of john adams the second president of the united states
[03:05:06.800 --> 03:05:12.080]  are you ignorant of the private federal reserve do you understand the nature of our fiat currency
[03:05:12.080 --> 03:05:17.440]  do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles
[03:05:17.440 --> 03:05:22.080]  and to profit from it what kind of leverage do these people and the federal reserve have
[03:05:22.080 --> 03:05:27.760]  over the american people or for that matter what kind of leverage do the saudis have over our money
[03:05:27.760 --> 03:05:33.120]  will you be a slave or will you be free adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without

[03:05:52.960 --> 03:05:58.480]  four or five years doing more and more research i came across the fact that the elite establishment
[03:05:58.480 --> 03:06:04.080]  is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition
[03:06:04.080 --> 03:06:10.400]  than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting
[03:06:10.400 --> 03:06:16.560]  killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just have concentrated

[03:10:11.360 --> 03:10:18.080]  discover oh and the stuff that we've been looking to up to uh it's myself daily caller uh some great
[03:10:18.080 --> 03:10:24.000]  sites offended america they've been going through hillary's new dark money pack called onward together
[03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:29.760]  and they've actually found it looks about 800 thousand dollars from hillary clinton now in the
[03:10:29.760 --> 03:10:34.960]  hands of antifa wow 800 thousand dollars she could have given a dollar to each docker recipient
[03:10:34.960 --> 03:10:38.640]  you know because she cares so much about the docker recipients but she just ignores that
[03:10:39.280 --> 03:10:44.720]  because she'd rather fund taking down america so jack is going to be breaking all of that down
[03:10:44.720 --> 03:10:49.760]  in the next segment but we've got some callers on the line here so let's clear out the deck
[03:10:49.760 --> 03:10:54.640]  with jack psobic here in the fourth hour of the alex joneshow let's start with philip in virginia
[03:10:54.640 --> 03:11:00.000]  go ahead philip yeah i was just going to say you know i don't know that the news covered it because
[03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:04.480]  it wasn't a show that they wanted but it was like a rally like they had in shawlsville and richmond
[03:11:04.480 --> 03:11:10.080]  this past weekend yep and it was like all this big hike to do all week long and everybody you
[03:11:10.080 --> 03:11:14.240]  know like all getting tense in the city who's worried about them tearing the trash and you know
[03:11:14.240 --> 03:11:20.960]  richmond up and so it's like on monument avenue it's like kind of the it's like mostly million
[03:11:21.520 --> 03:11:27.200]  million dollar homes you know along that avenue it's like the elite and kind of the rich people
[03:11:27.200 --> 03:11:32.560]  live there and it's basically so they were all like scared running out of town and
[03:11:35.600 --> 03:11:40.400]  then it was all this soup to law and then it was like i think it was six people you know that came
[03:11:40.400 --> 03:11:44.800]  and they were from i think you're from tennessee that showed up with confeder flags you know and
[03:11:44.800 --> 03:11:50.400]  they didn't say nothing about hate they denounced to kill an and all this and there was about
[03:11:50.400 --> 03:11:57.280]  400 protesters and it was like the money that the rich the money that the rich city of richmond
[03:11:57.280 --> 03:12:02.640]  spent on this soup law you know for six people and they didn't get the violence they didn't get
[03:12:02.640 --> 03:12:07.280]  the violence that they can use to try to demonize trump supporters here or to try to make all
[03:12:07.280 --> 03:12:12.320]  trump supporters white supremacist jack you're close to that area yeah amazing how when it's a
[03:12:12.320 --> 03:12:16.080]  peaceful rally it doesn't get the same kind of coverage on the mainstream media when they don't
[03:12:16.080 --> 03:12:20.160]  have the violence the fighting in the streets that they want you know we had a peaceful rally here
[03:12:20.160 --> 03:12:25.280]  in washington dc they called it the mother of all rallies last weekend for uh for trump and without
[03:12:25.280 --> 03:12:31.280]  any uh trump surrogates there without the president himself anyone else we had about 300 people out
[03:12:31.280 --> 03:12:36.080]  and there was no violence there was no anger it was people literally dancing a diverse crowd
[03:12:36.080 --> 03:12:39.760]  but of course the mainstream media wouldn't cover it because it just showed trump supporters loving
[03:12:39.760 --> 03:12:46.880]  their country shocking yeah and then another funny thing about it too was like they rested i think
[03:12:46.880 --> 03:12:52.080]  seven or eight people or whatever it was and one of them was charged with possession of a stolen
[03:12:52.080 --> 03:12:58.000]  weapon and possession of concealing it yeah the police actually said that they were not they were
[03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:04.400]  going to have a weapons ban at that event yeah well another one was charged in possession of
[03:13:04.400 --> 03:13:09.840]  firearm by a convicted felon so that tells me the IQ of these people and these were people
[03:13:09.840 --> 03:13:14.000]  that were there to protest against trump and against the people protecting the confederate
[03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:20.720]  monuments yeah so it's like and then they weren't even from richmond either so oh shocking oh wow yeah
[03:13:20.720 --> 03:13:27.040]  we never see that jack we never see these protesters come in no no no yeah i actually had
[03:13:27.040 --> 03:13:32.640]  when the DACA announcement was signed i actually had the wherewithal to go down to trump tower uh
[03:13:32.640 --> 03:13:38.560]  well trump hotel here in dc and i sat in front of it and i waited and i i've copied this the pictures
[03:13:38.560 --> 03:13:45.040]  i got the video i actually saw the bus drive up to trump dc all of the DACA protesters file off
[03:13:45.040 --> 03:13:49.600]  the bus the organizers get them all in place completely in spanish of course and then the
[03:13:49.600 --> 03:13:55.600]  bus drives away and then the mainstream media shows up and starts covering it so it's like yeah
[03:13:55.600 --> 03:14:00.240]  here you go and it's it's funny because you know we talk about these busting protesters but i was
[03:14:00.240 --> 03:14:04.720]  like no i'm actually going to go and stake it out and get the bus and i caught it yeah and you can
[03:14:04.720 --> 03:14:08.880]  do that the majority of these protests there's usually buses that show up they load them on the
[03:14:08.880 --> 03:14:15.360]  bus and uh as you pointed out you're going to get into this uh later here in the fourth hour
[03:14:15.360 --> 03:14:21.040]  how they use these packs you know soros money clinton foundation money to fund these protests
[03:14:21.040 --> 03:14:25.440]  and to get this stuff stirred up in the streets of course we had the project veritas video talking
[03:14:25.440 --> 03:14:31.840]  about how those direct orders from hillary's mouth she wants trump duck and so bob kramer uh who now
[03:14:31.840 --> 03:14:37.040]  doesn't have a job is the one that makes it happen and the rest of the people bad i mean how bad was
[03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:44.320]  that meme too the left can't meme oh and the left can't meme trump duck what what even was that trump
[03:14:44.320 --> 03:14:48.720]  is a duck what because he because he don't know duck i don't know it's a donald duck i don't i like
[03:14:48.720 --> 03:14:53.760]  donald duck how is that bad i like donald duck yeah i don't understand but that's easy because his name
[03:14:53.760 --> 03:14:58.800]  is donald so they can just be like oh his name's don't see even there like you have to explain it
[03:14:58.800 --> 03:15:04.560]  and think about it like okay his name is no you're not no no no no jack your problem is you can't
[03:15:04.560 --> 03:15:10.960]  think simply enough i'm sorry you need to know what you need to bring your iq down to understand
[03:15:10.960 --> 03:15:16.720]  these people i need to come way way way down exactly and donald duck is donald therefore i
[03:15:16.720 --> 03:15:23.360]  the left can't meme now now you're getting it though i see now donald right and because orange
[03:15:23.360 --> 03:15:27.200]  right the gill i never understood why did donald duck wear a towel when he got out of the shower
[03:15:27.200 --> 03:15:31.840]  i'm saying i'm saying i think he's got two i think he was i think he was trying to hide two
[03:15:31.840 --> 03:15:40.640]  scoops let's go to denis in new york go ahead denis uh yeah hi i was calling about um you guys
[03:15:40.640 --> 03:15:47.760]  have played a clip of uh what's this steven colbert at the emmy's yesterday this stupid joke that he
[03:15:47.760 --> 03:15:54.400]  made about trump saying that oh the emmies are are cited by a popular vote the emmies aren't even
[03:15:54.400 --> 03:16:02.240]  decided by popular that means i decided by some like group of whoever decides whoever's the best
[03:16:02.240 --> 03:16:07.440]  oh yeah the emmies are totally rigged absolutely if the emmies are as rigged as the dnc primary
[03:16:08.000 --> 03:16:13.440]  maybe more possibly more yeah you just don't you just don't see people dying over the rigging of
[03:16:13.440 --> 03:16:22.880]  the emmies that's the only difference oh too soon anything else denis a joke is supposed to be like

[03:16:28.880 --> 03:16:36.720]  on hold on a joke is supposed to be funny that's it yeah if you're gonna do humor it's gotta be
[03:16:36.720 --> 03:16:40.640]  funny first these people are funny and this is what we're just talking about with the with these
[03:16:40.640 --> 03:16:44.720]  memes they don't know how to mean because they have no sense of humor donald trump was elected in
[03:16:44.720 --> 03:16:49.280]  great part i i bet you there are people out there who said i'm gonna vote for trump because he's
[03:16:49.280 --> 03:16:54.160]  funny i'm telling you you know there's people out there that said that it's just amazing how
[03:16:54.160 --> 03:17:01.520]  they will they'll completely just completely abandon the entire point of of comedy the entire
[03:17:01.520 --> 03:17:07.120]  point of entertainment the entire point of the theater we go to the theater to get away from
[03:17:07.120 --> 03:17:13.120]  the realities of the real world we go to a comedy act to laugh and have fun and these people have
[03:17:13.120 --> 03:17:17.520]  politicized everything and they're not entertaining and they're not funny anymore let's take one more
[03:17:17.520 --> 03:17:21.040]  call with jack basobic let's go to jim also in new york go ahead jim
[03:17:24.160 --> 03:17:32.560]  hello hi hey how you doing doing good hey so um my name is millennial matt and i challenge any
[03:17:32.560 --> 03:17:37.840]  info worth employee to a debate on the validity of the claims of the so-called wow so this is
[03:17:37.840 --> 03:17:43.280]  actually millennial matt who doesn't believe in the holocaust we have we have an interloper here we
[03:17:43.280 --> 03:17:49.440]  have a holocaust so so let me ask you a question what are all of the images we see of jewish people
[03:17:49.440 --> 03:17:53.920]  literally skin and bones starving to death overflowing trains there's an entire holocaust
[03:17:53.920 --> 03:17:58.240]  museum all kinds of pictures and video what is in the Auschwitz have have you been Auschwitz the
[03:17:58.240 --> 03:18:03.440]  reason that a lot of those pictures you have skinny emaciated bodies is because near the end
[03:18:03.440 --> 03:18:09.920]  of the war the allies bombed all of their trade all of their um fly route and everybody was starving
[03:18:11.760 --> 03:18:17.120]  that's historically inaccurate so your argument so your argument is that the holocaust happened
[03:18:17.120 --> 03:18:20.320]  is that is that we're home getting here if you're saying like so we're saying that the pictures
[03:18:20.320 --> 03:18:24.160]  were true and you're admitting that they're true so i don't really see your argument here
[03:18:24.160 --> 03:18:29.600]  okay well when you when you gas somebody with daikon b which is impossible in the first place
[03:18:29.600 --> 03:18:35.360]  they don't magically become emaciated people become emaciated through disease and starvation
[03:18:35.360 --> 03:18:39.440]  there's a reason they were starved you want to understand why they were starved yeah because
[03:18:39.440 --> 03:18:43.600]  you're malnourished you don't have food on are you an expert on gassing people matt
[03:18:44.480 --> 03:18:48.000]  oh what are your credentials what are your credentials in this in this in this uh in this
[03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:54.720]  field you have a degree in any of this do you have have you gone to school for any of this again
[03:18:54.720 --> 03:19:00.960]  i challenge any of you to a debate on the tasks what are you talking about you're on the air right
[03:19:00.960 --> 03:19:08.640]  now okay okay let's go this six million number it's it's false okay so you're asked you a simple
[03:19:08.640 --> 03:19:13.120]  question and now you're jumping around and you're just throwing other facts at us and i and if you're
[03:19:13.120 --> 03:19:19.520]  not going to answer questions then we can't have a real debate i answered your question so jack

[03:24:47.440 --> 03:24:53.840]  favorite group to hate antifa ladies and gentlemen we've actually been able to break down now
[03:24:53.840 --> 03:24:58.880]  the funding for antifa the flow where it comes from now we've been talking about in the past
[03:24:58.880 --> 03:25:04.320]  how money had flown from george soros and george soros's coffers his hedge fund money
[03:25:04.320 --> 03:25:09.040]  all the way to these front groups for antifa groups like color of change groups like uh
[03:25:09.040 --> 03:25:15.600]  smash fascism groups like by all means those were the ones in the past that have have been
[03:25:15.600 --> 03:25:21.040]  supporting antifa so we were very careful in keeping an eye on those those groups and peter
[03:25:21.040 --> 03:25:26.400]  hasson over a daily caller he did a great investigative job pouring through federal
[03:25:26.400 --> 03:25:32.480]  election commission reports to see where these groups were getting their funding to see where
[03:25:32.480 --> 03:25:39.520]  it's all coming from and now the breaking news is that eight hundred thousand dollars of their money
[03:25:39.520 --> 03:25:46.480]  is coming from none other than hillary clinton hillary clinton's dark money pack onward together
[03:25:46.480 --> 03:25:52.000]  now this is a group that she started after the election okay she started this back in may this
[03:25:52.000 --> 03:25:56.800]  was supposed to be her big coming out story if she came out of the woods you guys remember she
[03:25:56.800 --> 03:26:00.320]  was going into the woods all the time with her husband and she kept popping up here in there
[03:26:00.320 --> 03:26:06.480]  like pennywise the clown well we are now finding out that eight hundred thousand dollars from her
[03:26:06.480 --> 03:26:11.760]  initial campaign so people donated to hillary clinton's campaign right and if you donate to
[03:26:11.760 --> 03:26:15.360]  hillary's campaign you may have just been a rank and file democrat you didn't support any of this
[03:26:15.360 --> 03:26:19.680]  extreme alt left groups you didn't support the violence in the streets you just wanted to support
[03:26:19.680 --> 03:26:25.280]  a political candidate well what hillary clinton has done is she's taken that money turned it over
[03:26:25.280 --> 03:26:30.640]  to her dark pack her dark money pack onward together we call it a dark money pack because it
[03:26:30.640 --> 03:26:35.600]  doesn't have her name on it it doesn't have a direct association with her campaign but we all
[03:26:35.600 --> 03:26:40.320]  know that it's essentially the same people running it right she's still calling the shots when it
[03:26:40.320 --> 03:26:44.000]  comes down to it the same way that she was doing this with the bob kramer groups and the bird
[03:26:44.000 --> 03:26:49.200]  dogging that bright project very tossed completely broke apart during the 2016 election and their
[03:26:49.200 --> 03:26:54.560]  excellent sting operations now we found that the eight hundred thousand dollars eight hundred thousand
[03:26:54.560 --> 03:26:59.440]  dollars and that's the same number as the people on docker right now so instead of giving money to
[03:26:59.440 --> 03:27:04.000]  docker instead giving a dollar to every single one of these docker recipients what she's doing
[03:27:04.000 --> 03:27:10.480]  instead is turning and giving it over to antifa now i would love if someone were to go up to
[03:27:10.480 --> 03:27:14.240]  hillary at one of these events that she's having she's having these book signings she was just over
[03:27:14.240 --> 03:27:19.440]  in cosco in the toilet section or excuse me toilet paper section let's be let's be true we don't want
[03:27:19.440 --> 03:27:23.920]  to be fake news we're gonna we're gonna put the facts and let the facts lie where they lie hillary
[03:27:23.920 --> 03:27:28.320]  clinton was in the toilet paper aisle yesterday at cosco which is a sentence that is actually true
[03:27:28.320 --> 03:27:35.680]  in 2017 but instead of raising money for causes like the hurricane for causes like hurricane herma
[03:27:35.680 --> 03:27:41.840]  hurricane harvey for the poor for impoverished for inner cities no no no she's giving money
[03:27:41.840 --> 03:27:50.160]  instead to antifa she's hiding behind her giant toilet paper wall and handing money over to antifa
[03:27:50.160 --> 03:27:56.560]  so the question now becomes is hillary clinton the leader of antifa right we all thought it was
[03:27:56.560 --> 03:28:02.080]  george soros in the past but now has hillary clinton risen to take upon that mantle to take on
[03:28:02.080 --> 03:28:06.960]  that role because she couldn't win the the presidency and now the only roles that she's
[03:28:06.960 --> 03:28:13.200]  she's finding herself's around are toilet paper roles um i gotta i gotta tell you guys i'll be
[03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:18.880]  here all week i i write my own material on the jack vasovic show i'm just kidding so all of the
[03:28:18.880 --> 03:28:23.920]  violence though you know let's get serious for a second all of the violence that antifa has
[03:28:23.920 --> 03:28:30.400]  perpetrated the attacks on police officers the attacks on trump supporters the attacks on freedom
[03:28:30.400 --> 03:28:37.840]  of speech now hillary clinton is the candidate for president we're not talking about some
[03:28:37.840 --> 03:28:42.720]  you know hugely circuitous route the money laundering all this stuff sting operations
[03:28:42.720 --> 03:28:47.600]  they're doing it brazenly and they're doing it in the open they're doing it because they can think
[03:28:47.600 --> 03:28:52.320]  they can get away with it they're doing it because they used to have james comey as their bagman
[03:28:52.320 --> 03:28:58.560]  who covered up all of the crimes who refused to prosecute we found out that his uh his evaluation
[03:28:58.560 --> 03:29:02.720]  was written before the investigation was over that was going to let her off the hook but now
[03:29:02.720 --> 03:29:07.840]  she's not going to be let off the hook because we're doing the investigation because people like
[03:29:07.840 --> 03:29:11.840]  daily caller are out there and it urged you guys to go to their site to go to the other sites and
[03:29:11.840 --> 03:29:18.160]  check this out the info war continues the info war completely continues and we are not going to stop
[03:29:18.160 --> 03:29:23.360]  going after hillary clinton and going after the sources of money for groups like antifa we are
[03:29:23.360 --> 03:29:28.000]  going to hold their feet to the fire we're going to let people know what's going on in this country
[03:29:28.000 --> 03:29:33.040]  we are going to let people know and we're going to follow the monies because we know that the
[03:29:33.040 --> 03:29:42.320]  buck doesn't stop unless we stop right back the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[03:29:42.320 --> 03:29:52.080]  network james madison the father of the bill of rights wrote where an excess of power prevails
[03:29:52.080 --> 03:29:57.680]  property of no sort is duly respected no man is safe in his opinions in his person in his
[03:29:57.680 --> 03:30:02.880]  faculties or in his possessions is there any question that we have an excess of power in
[03:30:02.880 --> 03:30:08.400]  washington the only question is how do we contain it and how do we remove that power from washington
[03:30:08.400 --> 03:30:14.240]  to our local communities to the individual that is the ultimate concern the concentration of power
[03:30:14.240 --> 03:30:19.760]  the excess of power was always the chief concern of the founders of this country that was why the
[03:30:19.760 --> 03:30:24.000]  anti-federalists opposed the constitution they believe they put safeguards in the constitution
[03:30:24.000 --> 03:30:29.280]  to abuse that concentration of power but as james madison also pointed out knowledge will forever
[03:30:29.280 --> 03:30:34.640]  govern ignorance of people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power
[03:30:34.640 --> 03:30:39.040]  that knowledge gives arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing of what
[03:30:39.040 --> 03:30:45.040]  the real constraints upon them are only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions

[03:33:08.640 --> 03:33:18.800]  ladies and gentlemen jack vasovic takes over info wars guest hosting here on the big fourth hour
[03:33:18.800 --> 03:33:25.120]  we have so much news to cover today because there's so much going on in our country one thing i really
[03:33:25.120 --> 03:33:30.400]  wanted to get into i really wanted to start covering is folks did you know did you know that
[03:33:30.400 --> 03:33:36.480]  we are one week away from election day did you know that there is an election a special election
[03:33:36.480 --> 03:33:41.440]  happening in just one week what am i talking about i thought we had an election last year well
[03:33:41.440 --> 03:33:47.040]  actually there's an election coming up it's next week and it's going to be in alabama
[03:33:47.040 --> 03:33:51.760]  because what happened is now you guys remember that donald trump when he became president he
[03:33:51.760 --> 03:33:57.600]  actually appointed a lot of people from congress into his uh into his cabinet into his administration
[03:33:57.600 --> 03:34:03.040]  we've had congressmen have gone in we've had senators that have gone in and right now what
[03:34:03.040 --> 03:34:09.520]  we're doing is we're replacing jeff sessions from the alabama senate he has a race that's coming up
[03:34:09.520 --> 03:34:14.880]  there's a special election to replace him now there there was a primary and now the primary
[03:34:14.880 --> 03:34:21.120]  is going to a runoff the runoff election is happening just next week and there's a lot of
[03:34:21.120 --> 03:34:26.400]  interest in this race there's a lot of people lined up on both sides of it and things are
[03:34:26.400 --> 03:34:30.480]  shaking out a little differently than usual so i wanted to break this down for people
[03:34:30.480 --> 03:34:36.320]  and explain to those people who are keeping an eye on what's going on now because it's alabama
[03:34:36.320 --> 03:34:43.760]  and because it's such a red state right alabama is a deep red state so the primary election
[03:34:43.760 --> 03:34:50.480]  is a lot more i should say caustic and probably more important than the general because it is
[03:34:50.480 --> 03:34:55.120]  most likely that a republican is going to win the seat this is session seat it's a very safe
[03:34:55.120 --> 03:35:00.160]  seat for republicans and as long as a good republican wins a strong republican candidate
[03:35:00.160 --> 03:35:03.520]  i wouldn't say they're guaranteed to win obviously anything can happen especially
[03:35:04.080 --> 03:35:09.040]  these days in politics but with my political analysis had on i'm from my days as a former
[03:35:09.040 --> 03:35:13.920]  political operative uh living out out of philadelphia where i've just heard that uh some people on the
[03:35:13.920 --> 03:35:19.120]  info wars team are also from and it's amazing to be to be working with neighbors it's amazing to
[03:35:19.120 --> 03:35:23.040]  be working with people from philly you know they don't realize that there are people from philadelphia
[03:35:23.040 --> 03:35:27.600]  that would believe in real news and getting the truth out there because they assume that uh that
[03:35:27.600 --> 03:35:31.120]  oh you're just all a bunch of liberals and you're just going to go with the whatever the deep
[03:35:31.120 --> 03:35:36.480]  liberal politics are from your area well no we're actually free thinkers and we actually
[03:35:36.480 --> 03:35:40.960]  think about things instead of just kind of repeating whatever talking points the mainstream
[03:35:40.960 --> 03:35:45.760]  media and headlines are given to us so just because we support trump just because we support
[03:35:46.400 --> 03:35:50.640]  getting the real story out there that doesn't mean we fall in line with everything else so
[03:35:50.640 --> 03:35:57.440]  so looking into this race it breaks down a lot of stuff because there's ruther there's luther
[03:35:57.440 --> 03:36:03.600]  strange who's currently the the sitting senator there he was he used to be the attorney general
[03:36:03.600 --> 03:36:07.360]  and he was appointed to fill out the remainder of sessions term until the special election
[03:36:07.360 --> 03:36:13.440]  so he's sitting there as acting senator and then there's the alabama supreme court justice chief
[03:36:13.440 --> 03:36:21.040]  justice roi moore now what's interesting in this is that president trump has endorsed luther strange
[03:36:21.040 --> 03:36:27.600]  however luther strange is the establishment candidate in this case luther strange he's
[03:36:27.600 --> 03:36:35.200]  a mitch mcconnell supported candidate they've already dumped eight
[03:36:35.200 --> 03:36:44.480]  bill mcconnell commerce this guy and work for him so there's a lot going on in terms of the
[03:36:44.480 --> 03:36:50.160]  establishment going to work for luther strange luther strange as it comes down to he is a former
[03:36:50.160 --> 03:36:56.400]  lobbyist he is a former lobbyist for the chamber he did a lot of work on that he's done work on a
[03:36:56.400 --> 03:37:03.280]  lot of the chamber's agreements in the past roi moore on the other hand he is more of the trump
[03:37:03.280 --> 03:37:09.680]  candidate he's uh in line with the president when it comes to things like the raise act the raise act
[03:37:09.680 --> 03:37:17.280]  is for merit based immigration rather than uh DACA and just sort of this like amnesty type stuff
[03:37:18.240 --> 03:37:22.720]  luther strange on the other hand has not given a position on the raise act and he hasn't said
[03:37:22.720 --> 03:37:28.320]  whether or not he's for or against amnesty the raise act will change us we're talking legal
[03:37:28.320 --> 03:37:33.440]  immigration here would change that from the sort of chain migration system that we have now and
[03:37:33.440 --> 03:37:39.840]  push forward to a more merit based system looking at the economic opportunities in america and
[03:37:39.840 --> 03:37:46.000]  figuring out which types of sets of skills do we want for immigrants coming into the united states
[03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:49.920]  because when it comes down to it the current immigration system in the united states was
[03:37:49.920 --> 03:37:56.400]  written a generation ago and the things and america as it was a generation ago is certainly
[03:37:56.400 --> 03:38:02.720]  different than america as it is today so why are we still using the same policies that we did
[03:38:03.440 --> 03:38:08.480]  a generation ago right that we use today that's what the raise act does the raise act takes a
[03:38:08.480 --> 03:38:14.160]  look at the board wipes clean uh previous policies that we've had and starts anew with a merit based
[03:38:14.160 --> 03:38:19.280]  system president trump came very close to endorsing this and so that's why people were very confused
[03:38:19.280 --> 03:38:26.240]  as to why he would then turn around and endorse a candidate like luther strange who is the chamber
[03:38:26.240 --> 03:38:31.200]  of commerce's candidate many have called him i don't know if i'd go this far just yet they've
[03:38:31.200 --> 03:38:35.600]  called him a globalist candidate and here's what it comes down to folks i don't necessarily think
[03:38:35.600 --> 03:38:41.760]  that luther strange is a a bad guy i don't think that most of the of people in the establishment
[03:38:41.760 --> 03:38:47.440]  weren't necessarily bad people that's just jack was so big's opinion but i think they have a different
[03:38:47.440 --> 03:38:55.760]  world view they have a world view that people immigrants are cheap labor that can come in
[03:38:55.760 --> 03:39:00.240]  from countries uh to the south of us they can come in from east asia come in in some cases
[03:39:00.240 --> 03:39:05.440]  from the middle east and provide that cheap labor for big corporations that is the reason
[03:39:05.440 --> 03:39:10.000]  that they're pushing this stuff that's the reason that they're pushing eight million dollars to
[03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:14.160]  luther strange that's the reason that they're pushing so hard for their candidates and their
[03:39:14.160 --> 03:39:17.520]  policies to get in that's why they didn't want the border adjustment tax that's why they don't
[03:39:17.520 --> 03:39:22.400]  want the wall that's why they want docket amnesty and for people saying that docket amnesty is only
[03:39:22.400 --> 03:39:27.680]  for 800 000 i would say that you're being completely disingenuous and you're clueless as the actual
[03:39:27.680 --> 03:39:35.040]  issue the 800 000 number only comes from people that have signed up under docket amnesty that's
[03:39:35.040 --> 03:39:40.560]  self-registered so when obama passed docket in the first place through his executive fiat uh
[03:39:40.560 --> 03:39:45.920]  when he was the president right in the election year 2012 the 800 000 were the people that signed
[03:39:45.920 --> 03:39:51.280]  up but there are still people that may have come into the united states illegally as children
[03:39:51.280 --> 03:39:59.200]  that did not register that larger number has been estimated by some groups as to as many as one two
[03:39:59.200 --> 03:40:06.960]  even three million plus if a new amnesty program was put forward it may trigger another flood
[03:40:06.960 --> 03:40:12.080]  of four to six million foreign nationals from coming in because folks when you when you offer
[03:40:12.080 --> 03:40:16.080]  people a free lunch you're going to get more people to show up to your lunch than usual right
[03:40:16.080 --> 03:40:20.480]  if you say hey guys we're having free lunch it's amnesty in america today do you want to sign
[03:40:20.480 --> 03:40:24.800]  up for the free amnesty of course you're going to get more people signing up than when you had to
[03:40:24.800 --> 03:40:30.320]  pay for it under the under the previous bill under the previous administrations uh docket
[03:40:30.320 --> 03:40:35.760]  executive order program this would be legislation this would be something that would be very hard
[03:40:35.760 --> 03:40:40.000]  to undo you couldn't just rescind it now the president trump was able to rescind docket because
[03:40:40.000 --> 03:40:44.080]  it was an executive order so all he had to do was say i rescind it and he did it because he was
[03:40:44.080 --> 03:40:50.080]  president and that's all it had been done as but if it's a law if it's legislation you actually have
[03:40:50.080 --> 03:40:56.800]  to go through other legislation in order to make any changes to it to update it in any way or you'd
[03:40:56.800 --> 03:41:02.880]  have to take it to court and say it was unconstitutional from some way shape or form either way if this
[03:41:02.880 --> 03:41:09.920]  dream act goes through and it's signed they're going to be a lot more people coming in to take
[03:41:09.920 --> 03:41:17.040]  those jobs to be eligible for those benefits that people in the us currently who are struggling
[03:41:17.040 --> 03:41:22.400]  are not going to be able to get and that's simply all of those issues are coming to play coming to
[03:41:22.400 --> 03:41:28.800]  bear in this race in alabama which takes place next week now there's another one there's another
[03:41:29.440 --> 03:41:33.440]  issue to this too you know people are in the united states are talking about tearing down
[03:41:33.440 --> 03:41:37.280]  monuments these days they're talking about tearing down it started with a confederate
[03:41:37.280 --> 03:41:43.040]  statues and then it started with and then they moved on to defacing the Lincoln memorial it moved
[03:41:43.040 --> 03:41:48.480]  on to the people like thomas jefferson they went after frances or uh uh yeah they went after frances
[03:41:48.480 --> 03:41:53.760]  scott key and they said that we have a racist anthem so suddenly it started right with the
[03:41:53.760 --> 03:42:00.400]  confederate statues but it moved forward as we all knew they would well you go back and look and
[03:42:00.400 --> 03:42:04.560]  what were the first monuments that people that the left tried to take down when their cultural
[03:42:04.560 --> 03:42:12.000]  marxist movement got started it wasn't confederate statues it was christian statues do you remember
[03:42:12.000 --> 03:42:18.080]  this the 10 commandments there was a statue of them at the alabama courthouse the alabama supreme
[03:42:18.080 --> 03:42:25.440]  court and the person that fought to keep them up was none other than chief justice roy more now
[03:42:25.440 --> 03:42:31.280]  i believe that americans should have freedom of religion that is part of our first amendment
[03:42:31.280 --> 03:42:36.720]  and whether you're you're a catholic christian buddhist jewish whatever religion you are you
[03:42:36.720 --> 03:42:40.000]  should have the right to practice that freely in our country that's enshrined in one of our
[03:42:40.000 --> 03:42:45.040]  founding documents the constitution that being said that doesn't mean that you have freedom
[03:42:45.040 --> 03:42:51.120]  from religion either and that monument was set up there under alabama law it was voted for by the
[03:42:51.120 --> 03:42:57.760]  people of alabama they wanted it there not to say that they were enforced by the cons by alabama
[03:42:57.760 --> 03:43:03.520]  that it was enforced but just as a way of commemorating one of the earliest sources of law the 10
[03:43:03.520 --> 03:43:10.480]  commandments roy more fought to keep that monument up because he understood the importance of christian
[03:43:10.480 --> 03:43:18.480]  heritage he understood the importance of knowing where our laws come from our history of laws come
[03:43:18.480 --> 03:43:23.760]  from that's that was really the the main way that i knew about roy more the first thing that i had
[03:43:23.760 --> 03:43:28.800]  heard about him before he started running for senate in the special election and it's just
[03:43:28.800 --> 03:43:33.840]  something to put out there to people i'm simply reporting the facts on the on the whole situation
[03:43:33.840 --> 03:43:39.280]  on the election but it's a big thing and sitting here in washington dc as i do it's probably the
[03:43:39.280 --> 03:43:45.120]  biggest story right now next to and dc they always talk about the fake russia stuff but
[03:43:45.120 --> 03:43:50.800]  there really is a big focus on this because people are going to see will the trump endorsement of
[03:43:50.800 --> 03:43:56.800]  strange who's been kind of seen as a swamp creature you can submit it that way because he's a mcconnell
[03:43:56.800 --> 03:44:02.480]  guy will that endorsement be enough to carry him over the primary or will people who are supportive
[03:44:02.480 --> 03:44:07.680]  of the trump agenda people who are supportive of make america great again people who are supportive
[03:44:07.680 --> 03:44:13.360]  of immigration reform and rather than amnesty amnesty bills which have been pushed by the chamber of
[03:44:13.360 --> 03:44:20.960]  commerce will those people be able to push roy over the top now the president the president is going
[03:44:20.960 --> 03:44:28.640]  to huntsville alabama this saturday and holding a rally that rally he will endorse luther strange
[03:44:28.640 --> 03:44:33.120]  and he'll probably bring strage out at some point and say luther's a great guy he talked
[03:44:33.120 --> 03:44:37.280]  about him a lot on twitter he's called him big luther he said you have my support so it's going
[03:44:37.280 --> 03:44:41.120]  to be interesting to see what happens down there and i'm actually thinking of going down myself i
[03:44:41.120 --> 03:44:45.280]  don't know do you guys think i should go or not give me a comment send me a send me a message on
[03:44:45.280 --> 03:44:51.760]  twitter i may i may go i may not go but we're also seeing other people reach out and say that they
[03:44:52.800 --> 03:44:58.960]  rather endorse roi more sarah palin probably the biggest name at this point has come out
[03:44:58.960 --> 03:45:04.880]  in favor of roi more and she is saying and putting her money on the line putting her name on the line
[03:45:04.880 --> 03:45:09.120]  her reputation on the line with the conservative movement with the grassroots movement and saying
[03:45:09.120 --> 03:45:16.720]  i don't support loy uh this guy luther strange i support more because he stands with us on the
[03:45:16.720 --> 03:45:22.960]  issues he's the grassroots conservative he's the one that sarah palin has endorsed so it's kind of a
[03:45:22.960 --> 03:45:30.160]  big uh i'm not going to say fracture but i'm going to say it's a big issue right now within the
[03:45:30.160 --> 03:45:36.160]  trump movement as to whether or not strange is going to pull it out in on tuesday and from a
[03:45:36.160 --> 03:45:40.320]  political analyst perspective right this is this is the kind of stuff that political junkies like
[03:45:40.320 --> 03:45:44.560]  me live for right people who are sitting and reading drudge report every day they're reading
[03:45:44.560 --> 03:45:48.960]  info wars every day reading bright bar all of these sources trying to figure out what's the
[03:45:48.960 --> 03:45:53.120]  state of the electorate what do people want where do people want them you know and i've been looking
[03:45:53.120 --> 03:45:58.720]  at some of these comments on on these blogs and every time i gotta tell you i i do like to read
[03:45:58.720 --> 03:46:02.160]  comments and people ask about this they say jack you're you're doing so much stuff you're always
[03:46:02.160 --> 03:46:06.880]  running around you're getting married to tanya tay in in less than two months you know how do you
[03:46:06.880 --> 03:46:11.600]  have time to do all this and i say you know i read the comments i've read the comments because
[03:46:11.600 --> 03:46:17.920]  that gives you a sense of where the people are at that gives you a sense of not only understanding
[03:46:17.920 --> 03:46:22.960]  where the where the people are at it gives you a sense of of testing the pulse you know really
[03:46:22.960 --> 03:46:27.840]  taking the pulse of america and knowing where people stand on one issue or another and i've
[03:46:27.840 --> 03:46:31.600]  even had times where people said hey jack i think you're wrong on this and i'll look it up and if
[03:46:31.600 --> 03:46:36.480]  i'm wrong on something i'll say wow i had that totally wrong and i'll and i'll publish hey guys
[03:46:36.480 --> 03:46:40.960]  update i got more information man i was totally wrong on this you guys set me straight and i
[03:46:40.960 --> 03:46:46.480]  appreciate that that's the type of interaction that we have that the mainstream media will never
[03:46:46.480 --> 03:46:51.600]  have that's the type of interaction that we have and the willingness to have stepped forward on
[03:46:51.600 --> 03:46:58.000]  certain issues regardless of what it is dig deep into those issues and not turn around and say we
[03:46:58.000 --> 03:47:03.440]  were right we were right we were right but be willing to listen to people to listen to facts
[03:47:03.440 --> 03:47:09.120]  and actually say you know what we may have gotten something wrong i've got new information now
[03:47:09.120 --> 03:47:14.640]  that says this is actually the case what i reported earlier wasn't the full story so we're
[03:47:14.640 --> 03:47:18.960]  going to give you all sides of the story and that's why the mainstream media wants to shut us down
[03:47:18.960 --> 03:47:23.760]  that's why facebook and google are working so hard to push back on us and one story
[03:47:23.760 --> 03:47:30.960]  that i picked up earlier today that i think is absolutely mag magnanimous something that's
[03:47:30.960 --> 03:47:37.440]  going to be one of the biggest stories of 2017 is that there are now actually people in both parties
[03:47:37.440 --> 03:47:47.040]  the republicans and the democrats that are moving to regulate and possibly break up facebook google
[03:47:47.040 --> 03:47:54.480]  and other big tech companies so there's legislation that's being looked at and it's being supported
[03:47:54.480 --> 03:48:01.760]  by both the populist conservative movement and people that are democrats like mark warner okay
[03:48:01.760 --> 03:48:06.320]  they're looking and saying we've seen the way that they're censoring gab we've seen the way that
[03:48:06.320 --> 03:48:12.560]  they're throttling back on bright part on on info wars on anybody that doesn't tow the mainstream
[03:48:12.560 --> 03:48:19.920]  media line but it's also this censorship and this huge amount of influence that these organizations
[03:48:19.920 --> 03:48:26.080]  have that are starting to put them more and more under the purview of having them possibly
[03:48:26.080 --> 03:48:34.560]  regulated as public utilities the antitrust laws that are on the books okay and these were used
[03:48:34.560 --> 03:48:39.360]  against the telephone companies about a hundred years ago when they first came out these were
[03:48:39.360 --> 03:48:45.600]  used against the oil companies the steel companies because they got so big and they had so much
[03:48:45.600 --> 03:48:50.960]  influence and so much power in the united states that there were groups that said you know what
[03:48:51.840 --> 03:48:58.000]  these companies have become so large they've become so powerful that they are almost like
[03:48:58.000 --> 03:49:03.680]  governments unto themselves in their ability to influence information Tucker Carlson had a great
[03:49:03.680 --> 03:49:11.440]  line and i i i've got to give credit where it's due he said google almost regulates reality itself
[03:49:11.440 --> 03:49:18.000]  because google is a filter through which we learn about our world the first thing you go to to look
[03:49:18.000 --> 03:49:24.640]  up something is google they have an insane amount of market share when it comes to the search markets
[03:49:24.640 --> 03:49:28.880]  in the united states in terms of who uses google right you don't hear people talking about yahoo
[03:49:28.880 --> 03:49:33.600]  you don't hear people talking about being google is a verb it's something that people put out there
[03:49:33.600 --> 03:49:40.560]  and so if this organization whether it be a government organization or or a private organization
[03:49:40.560 --> 03:49:45.280]  and i would even contend i would even contend and libertarians disagree on this i would contend
[03:49:46.080 --> 03:49:52.640]  that google and facebook because of their collusion and working hand in glove with the obama
[03:49:52.640 --> 03:50:00.480]  administration with congress with regulatory bodies they are practically public private
[03:50:00.480 --> 03:50:08.400]  organizations unto themselves they are practically hand in hand with the government so if google gets
[03:50:08.400 --> 03:50:12.800]  your all of your data if facebook gets all of your data and you think oh it's fine because
[03:50:12.800 --> 03:50:18.160]  they're a private company what happens when they turn it over and hand it to the government what
[03:50:18.160 --> 03:50:22.800]  happens when they hand it to the deep state we're going to be right back we're going to finish it
[03:50:22.800 --> 03:50:27.840]  out we want to talk a little bit more about the russian narrative what stuff is coming up i want

[03:54:28.400 --> 03:54:32.880]  me but I gotta tell you Alex you might be making a very big mistake I'm just kidding so what is
[03:54:32.880 --> 03:54:39.760]  going on in the world guys we're now seeing this Trump Russia investigation it's going forward
[03:54:39.760 --> 03:54:47.680]  there's a lot of people talking about it Mueller Robert Mueller former head of the FBI now running
[03:54:47.680 --> 03:54:52.800]  as the independent counsel of this thing and there was the sort of an interesting thing that
[03:54:52.800 --> 03:54:59.920]  happened over the weekend where a lawyer believe it or not a lawyer for the Trump presidency for
[03:54:59.920 --> 03:55:04.640]  the administration was actually having dinner or excuse me I think I was having lunch believe it or
[03:55:04.640 --> 03:55:13.920]  not for right down the street from the New York Times offices at this steakhouse and this guy Ken
[03:55:13.920 --> 03:55:18.400]  Vogel who's a reporter for the New York Times in Washington DC happened to be at the steakhouse
[03:55:18.400 --> 03:55:23.280]  they were sitting down like literally right next to this guy in the steakhouse while having a
[03:55:23.280 --> 03:55:28.880]  conversation about the investigation and so I gotta ask this is just coming from me from from
[03:55:28.880 --> 03:55:34.320]  prior time I served in Navy intelligence I was a former Navy intelligence officer I didn't use
[03:55:34.320 --> 03:55:39.040]  to talk about this but nowadays I do talk about it because NBC blew my cover and decided to release
[03:55:39.040 --> 03:55:45.120]  all my records so they dox me they put it out there so fine I will admit it yes I was a Navy
[03:55:45.120 --> 03:55:50.640]  intelligence officer but tradecraft wise you would not normally go to talk about sensitive
[03:55:50.640 --> 03:55:57.200]  topics at a public steakhouse especially one that was only a few doors down from the New
[03:55:57.200 --> 03:56:04.480]  York Times office so my question is my question is was this deliberate was this something that
[03:56:04.480 --> 03:56:08.400]  they wanted to actually have out there and one of the things they're worried of is that
[03:56:08.400 --> 03:56:16.080]  Mueller may be going and putting wires on people in the White House putting wires on them to go
[03:56:16.080 --> 03:56:21.920]  to get them to rat out their buddies to go to get them to get dirt on anybody they think
[03:56:21.920 --> 03:56:25.840]  that could be in the White House that they want to go after and look folks this really just goes
[03:56:25.840 --> 03:56:33.200]  to show you how completely lacking in evidence or in merit the investigation has at this point
[03:56:33.200 --> 03:56:37.200]  if they're getting people to wear wires and going into the White House number one
[03:56:37.200 --> 03:56:43.760]  if you're collecting on classified information that's absolutely illegal you cannot steal
[03:56:43.760 --> 03:56:48.480]  classified information regardless of who you are unless they've got they must have had some kind
[03:56:48.480 --> 03:56:54.560]  of crazy FISA warrant to be go and putting spies into the White House so Mueller putting spies
[03:56:54.560 --> 03:56:58.320]  and this this isn't something that we're just saying guys this is in Newsweek this is in the
[03:56:58.320 --> 03:57:04.160]  independent there is actually a worry that Mueller is now spying on the White House spying on the
[03:57:04.160 --> 03:57:10.960]  president because they have no evidence whatsoever they've turned over all the information they've
[03:57:10.960 --> 03:57:16.560]  been asked to they've answered every subpoena they've gone to great lengths to comply with Mueller
[03:57:16.560 --> 03:57:21.040]  but Mueller doesn't care because folks it's not really about Russia it's about taking down the
[03:57:21.040 --> 03:57:26.640]  president it's about taking down our movement it's about blocking the president's movement
[03:57:26.640 --> 03:57:32.080]  from getting into place that I've always said that I've always said that that even though they've
[03:57:32.080 --> 03:57:37.760]  cooperated fully and there's been some talk about strategy about how they wanted to cooperate
[03:57:37.760 --> 03:57:44.960]  the the investigation isn't about Russia there is no Russia collusion it was a canard there were no
[03:57:44.960 --> 03:57:50.400]  Russians involved the people involved with winning the presidency were the American people the
[03:57:50.400 --> 03:57:56.080]  citizens for Trump that I wrote about in my book citizens for Trump it was the people of info wars
[03:57:56.080 --> 03:58:01.200]  the info warriors that is how we won that is how we took back this country and we're not going
[03:58:01.200 --> 03:58:05.760]  anywhere we're not going to stop fighting for this movement we're not going to stop fighting
