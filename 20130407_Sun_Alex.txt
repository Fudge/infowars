[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:30.000 --> 00:48.600]  When an opponent declares, I will not come over to your side, I calmly say, your children
[00:48.600 --> 00:56.940]  belong to us already. What are you? You will pass on. Your descendants, however, now stand
[00:56.940 --> 01:03.920]  in the new camp. In a short time, they will know nothing else but this new community.
[01:03.920 --> 01:12.080]  That was Adolf Hitler in 1939 in a radio address. We have never invested as much in public education
[01:12.080 --> 01:15.620]  as we should have because we've always had kind of a private notion of children. Your
[01:15.620 --> 01:20.920]  kid is yours and totally your responsibility. We haven't had a very collective notion of
[01:20.920 --> 01:24.800]  these are our children. So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private
[01:24.800 --> 01:28.920]  idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize
[01:28.920 --> 01:33.320]  that kids belong to whole communities. Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just
[01:33.320 --> 01:38.840]  the households, then we start making better investments. And they then flash up in the
[01:38.840 --> 01:48.720]  official MSNBC promo forward, which is the original name of the slogan for the Marxist
[01:48.720 --> 01:53.800]  over 100 years old, like 120 something years old. And I shot a whole special video report
[01:53.800 --> 01:59.120]  on that that's up on Infowars.com. The state declares they own your children. And that
[01:59.120 --> 02:03.400]  was the MSNBC host or propagandist who directly worked for the White House.
[02:03.400 --> 02:10.800]  When you watch MSNBC, you were getting pure ambrosia, poison directly out of the White
[02:10.800 --> 02:15.520]  House. That is their agenda on record. Your kids belong to the collective is the article
[02:15.520 --> 02:20.240]  by Kurt Nemo read linked up at Infowars.com. It's a story that came out yesterday, but
[02:20.240 --> 02:23.800]  we have had our great web crew move it back to the top of the page.
[02:23.800 --> 02:30.040]  LinkedIn Red, Melissa Harris-Perry. I remember it was about eight years ago, a caller called
[02:30.040 --> 02:38.080]  in and he said, you're a liar, Alex. He said, there is no way that the official University
[02:38.080 --> 02:43.560]  of Texas textbook for social workers, and I was given the name out, it was the Calhoun
[02:43.560 --> 02:44.560]  Reader.
[02:44.560 --> 02:50.040]  There's no way, and Bob Dacy actually brought this to my attention, local talk show host.
[02:50.040 --> 02:55.560]  He had a copy of the textbook that family had been given going to UT. And the people
[02:55.560 --> 03:01.040]  didn't believe me. And so I had some of my writers go do research and they pulled up
[03:01.040 --> 03:08.520]  hundreds of publications that were then posted on the Prison Planet Forum, where they officially
[03:08.520 --> 03:10.520]  teach they're gonna get rid of the family.
[03:10.520 --> 03:14.360]  So when you hear them say, it's everybody's job to take care of kids, they mean get rid
[03:14.360 --> 03:18.200]  of parents. Don't let parents discipline their kids, and that only the state can discipline
[03:18.200 --> 03:22.000]  your children and then your kids will stay late at school and then no more summer recess.
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.520]  And the TV is already raising our children anyways, and the brainwashing that comes across
[03:26.520 --> 03:31.160]  the iPhones and the iPads and the droids and the rest of it.
[03:31.160 --> 03:36.240]  But they officially, in every authoritarian society for thousands of years, the state
[03:36.240 --> 03:41.200]  has controlled the youth. And Hitler knew that, I mean, he talks about taking over the
[03:41.200 --> 03:49.360]  youth in Mein Kampf. I mean, I've read myself Hitler's words, the Soviets, obviously, borrowed
[03:49.360 --> 03:50.840]  a lot from the communists.
[03:50.840 --> 03:57.360]  They have of course done the same thing. I was actually sent video by some folks, I think
[03:57.360 --> 04:01.760]  we've shown this on air before. I know it's on, I was gonna put in a film, I know it's
[04:01.760 --> 04:09.920]  in Rob Jacobson's hard drive where one of our graphics guys contractor years ago went
[04:09.920 --> 04:14.560]  to visit with his girlfriend, her family in China, and caught on video the youth brigades
[04:14.560 --> 04:19.880]  with red flags marching aggressively through the streets, pretty powerful footage.
[04:19.880 --> 04:22.460]  This is what they're establishing, this is what they're setting up. So we're gonna get
[04:22.460 --> 04:29.320]  into that. We'll have the latest from the DMZ, where world famous negotiator and hostage
[04:29.320 --> 04:37.480]  negotiator and psyop expert, Dr. Steve Pacinek, psychiatrist will be joining us from the DMZ.
[04:37.480 --> 04:42.200]  It's about 604 over there right now. Trust we've made contact with him to make sure he's
[04:42.200 --> 04:46.120]  ready in about 55 minutes, good, he's locked and loaded.
[04:46.120 --> 04:51.120]  We've got huge news with Biden calling for a new world order and then Gawker makes fun
[04:51.120 --> 04:56.760]  of it. Conspiracy Christmas comes early, cuz they were just saying last week, in a major
[04:56.760 --> 05:01.920]  poll that, the poll, do you believe in the made up new world order conspiracy theory?
[05:01.920 --> 05:05.840]  It's like saying, do you believe the sun came up this morning? Are you a kook? So we'll
[05:05.840 --> 05:09.160]  break all that down, it's a big broadcast today.
[05:09.160 --> 05:14.680]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[05:14.680 --> 05:20.000]  and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[05:20.000 --> 05:24.280]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[05:24.280 --> 05:29.520]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are, we all are.
[05:29.520 --> 05:34.240]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[05:34.240 --> 05:39.360]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply
[05:39.360 --> 05:43.720]  with E Foods Direct. Be prepared before you need it with nutrient dense food you can store

[06:52.360 --> 07:01.400]  this worldwide transmission. I am your host, Alex Jones. The news websites are infowars.com.
[07:01.400 --> 07:08.640]  That's infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and we're streaming video and audio as well for
[07:08.640 --> 07:12.360]  radio listeners that would like to see another added dimension of the radio broadcast at

[07:18.560 --> 07:23.640]  Operation Awaken the Sleeping Giant. You can find out about right there at prisonplanet.tv.
[07:23.640 --> 07:32.320]  Okay, where to start today? Where to begin? I want to read you a quote from a 1939 radio
[07:32.320 --> 07:39.680]  address that Adolf A. Lewis Hitler gave. You may have heard of him. When an opponent declares
[07:39.680 --> 07:46.700]  I will not come over to your side, I calmly say your children belong to us already. What
[07:46.700 --> 07:54.240]  are you? You will pass on. Your descendants, however, now stand in the new camp. In a short
[07:54.240 --> 07:59.560]  time, they will know nothing else but this new community, Adolf Hitler.
[07:59.560 --> 08:04.400]  And he said similar things years before in his book Mein Kampf. Now, the communist system
[08:04.400 --> 08:11.600]  in Russia, the communist system in China, Fidel Castro's Cuba, everyone knows that in
[08:11.600 --> 08:16.260]  these countries, the police wear a black mask. The state turns the children against the parents.
[08:16.260 --> 08:21.740]  The state tries to raise the kids in dormitories and really raises a generation of tax police
[08:21.740 --> 08:30.100]  and other enforcers out of children that they have CPSed for very petty reasons via the
[08:30.100 --> 08:34.380]  Soviet or Nazi courts.
[08:34.380 --> 08:41.000]  The Romans just came in and killed all the adult age men down to about age 13, 14 and
[08:41.000 --> 08:45.480]  then reeducated everybody. And so ancient empires just killed all the men and then took
[08:45.480 --> 08:49.760]  the women and children as slaves and then took the smarter ones to basically be enforcers,
[08:49.760 --> 08:51.720]  but still chattel slaves.
[08:51.720 --> 08:59.260]  They would be so proud of being a war slave, though. They had large brigades in the Roman
[08:59.260 --> 09:05.700]  Empire from the end of their republic on till their decline and the splitting into two empires,
[09:05.700 --> 09:13.020]  but I'm digressing, of special slave mercenaries who were proud of their slavery. That was
[09:13.020 --> 09:18.740]  passed on to the Prussians in Germany, of course, and that's where we get kindergarten.
[09:18.740 --> 09:22.780]  All the modern brainwashing systems we have today are designed to make people follow orders
[09:22.780 --> 09:26.400]  and be happy in their servitude.
[09:26.400 --> 09:33.640]  The Hessians were German slaves brought here to wage war on us in 1776, tens of thousands
[09:33.640 --> 09:39.480]  of them. But there was the prestige, even if you were a slave Hessian, you still had
[09:39.480 --> 09:47.060]  a fancy uniform and black goose-stepping boots, but I'm digressing, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:47.060 --> 09:50.860]  You know that authoritarian states try to take over the children, and I have read on
[09:50.860 --> 09:56.820]  air the official textbooks used by every major Western university. They all tell the people
[09:56.820 --> 10:01.700]  aspiring to be government minions and enforcers to have a disdain for the family, a disdain
[10:01.700 --> 10:03.300]  for men.
[10:03.300 --> 10:08.640]  If you turn on any sitcom or drama, men have been run down for 50 years as moron idiots
[10:08.640 --> 10:13.340]  with women bossing them around the new commanders. They are the house slaves. The Romans would
[10:13.340 --> 10:18.380]  bring in the women. Even as the boys grew up, they were kept out in a barn and not allowed
[10:18.380 --> 10:19.960]  to learn how to really speak.
[10:19.960 --> 10:24.540]  You don't want men knowing how to stand up. That was passed on to black slaves in the
[10:24.540 --> 10:28.660]  Caribbean, in South Central America, and of course, here in the United States. That's
[10:28.660 --> 10:33.460]  why you've heard of that before with the woman, the house slave in charge. Well, that actually
[10:33.460 --> 10:39.340]  came out of Rome mainly with white slaves. But side issue, feminism is not about empowering
[10:39.340 --> 10:41.620]  women, makes them the house slaves.
[10:41.620 --> 10:48.940]  They have a more pejorative name for it that black folks tend to use for it, but it's the
[10:48.940 --> 10:54.500]  people that are in the house. And that's what the police and the bureaucrats and the FBI
[10:54.500 --> 10:58.180]  and all them are, they're the house slaves. And then those of us that aren't part of the
[10:58.180 --> 11:05.340]  federal family, we're the barn slaves. I mean, that's how it's all set up. That's how it's
[11:05.340 --> 11:07.080]  looked at.
[11:07.080 --> 11:10.800]  And so that's what they've established and they all write handbooks on it. And I shot
[11:10.800 --> 11:16.860]  a special report up at info wars.com. The state declares that your children are slaves,
[11:16.860 --> 11:21.380]  is the name of the video. The article is MSNBC host, your kids belong to the collective.
[11:21.380 --> 11:26.820]  So my issue is I talk about this 15 years ago, seven years ago, and people would say
[11:26.820 --> 11:32.540]  you're a liar. Even when I was on the radio with the official textbooks, in one case,
[11:32.540 --> 11:36.820]  the Calhoun Reader used at the University of Texas for their social workers.
[11:36.820 --> 11:43.580]  And it said, quote, the family belongs to the age of barbarism and is a form of mental
[11:43.580 --> 11:47.580]  illness. And you can also pull up the head of the National Association of Psychiatrists
[11:47.580 --> 11:52.780]  in the 60s saying the same thing. So they sell it as a new human right to not have a
[11:52.780 --> 11:59.500]  family because they want you all alone, completely alone. That is the great goal of every authoritarian
[11:59.500 --> 12:00.500]  society.
[12:00.500 --> 12:05.100]  In fact, I wanna send somebody down to the microfilm or we should get a LexisNexis subscription.
[12:05.100 --> 12:08.820]  I had a Thomson Reuters subscription about six, seven years ago, but I never used it.
[12:08.820 --> 12:14.100]  So I got rid of it. Guys, on Monday, get a Thomson Reuters subscription and a LexisNexis.
[12:14.100 --> 12:20.280]  Google's great, but you can't find stuff, year 2000 and back, good on the web. Okay,
[12:20.280 --> 12:25.360]  so I want the 2000 Austin American statesmen when I caught bribery at the Capitol.
[12:25.360 --> 12:30.920]  It was the cover story in the Metro and State about investigation of bribery that we caught
[12:30.920 --> 12:34.940]  on video and I was there testifying. They were just paying them off out in the hallway
[12:34.940 --> 12:40.420]  and then they later had a state hearing, finding that it was illegal what happened and the
[12:40.420 --> 12:42.660]  individual over the committee got censured and things.
[12:42.660 --> 12:55.180]  The point was is that they quoted one of the handgun control, it was Violence Policy Center.
[12:55.180 --> 12:59.440]  They quoted them and they're saying, I don't care what Mr. Jones does, we're going to get
[12:59.440 --> 13:04.540]  your guns one day, we've got your kids. I mean, I want that quote, I probably read that
[13:04.540 --> 13:11.660]  quote 50 times on air, 50 times and I wanna resurrect that and actually show people that.
[13:11.660 --> 13:19.180]  So LexisNexis on Monday, because I wanna show people that and there it was saying, it doesn't
[13:19.180 --> 13:25.580]  matter, we've got your kids in the public school and we will ban guns in America.
[13:25.580 --> 13:29.340]  That's why I get so mad at people like Piers Morgan, when he says, I don't want your guns,
[13:29.340 --> 13:34.060]  bull. By the way, it came out this week, we've got them coming on later in the week. The
[13:34.060 --> 13:37.480]  Veritas project, they told me about this weeks ago before they went and did it, they went
[13:37.480 --> 13:42.460]  to the house of Piers Morgan in Hollywood, he's got armed guards.
[13:42.460 --> 13:45.940]  But he doesn't want you to be able to, who can't afford, you don't have an $8 million
[13:45.940 --> 13:51.020]  a year contract or whatever like he does. You're just a poor guy who makes $60,000 a
[13:51.020 --> 13:55.900]  year. Of course, Michael Moore says you're rich and you're a bad guy. And if you maybe
[13:55.900 --> 14:00.340]  make 60,000 and it's racist to own a gun, remember that clip two weeks ago?
[14:00.340 --> 14:03.780]  But of course, he's got armed guards too, I've seen them, but it's on record, he has
[14:03.780 --> 14:09.520]  them. That's why I get so mad, they want our guns to dominate us, period, everywhere they're
[14:09.520 --> 14:14.020]  in control, they take all the guns. So stop playing the game and arguing, hey, violent
[14:14.020 --> 14:20.460]  crime dropped 49% since 1991 because of proliferation of gun ownership, fbi.gov.
[14:20.460 --> 14:24.620]  They don't wanna hear that, they have got an agenda of foreign banks that have captured
[14:24.620 --> 14:29.040]  this country to take our guns. And they're saying, hey, Hitler said we've got your kids.
[14:29.040 --> 14:34.100]  The gun control group said it doesn't matter what Alex Jones does. That was their answer
[14:34.100 --> 14:37.440]  to Alex Jones caught all this going on at the Capitol. Their answer was we got your
[14:37.440 --> 14:43.640]  kids and we're gonna get your guns, Mr. Jones isn't gonna stop us.
[14:43.640 --> 14:46.980]  And that's why I'm angry at them, they're authoritarians and they know it, it's not
[14:46.980 --> 14:52.060]  like they're misguided. Now here is MSNBC host in a TV ad they're running, it's not
[14:52.060 --> 14:56.300]  like it's something they just said flippantly. This is a TV ad they're running saying your
[14:56.300 --> 15:00.460]  kids don't belong to you, they belong to the collective, here it is.
[15:00.460 --> 15:05.180]  We have never invested as much in public education as we should have because we've always had
[15:05.180 --> 15:10.600]  kind of a private notion of children. Your kid is yours and totally your responsibility.
[15:10.600 --> 15:14.680]  We haven't had a very collective notion of these are our children. So part of it is we
[15:14.680 --> 15:18.760]  have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or
[15:18.760 --> 15:22.420]  kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[15:22.420 --> 15:26.440]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making
[15:26.440 --> 15:28.040]  better investments.
[15:28.040 --> 15:33.120]  And they have an actual original Marxist slogan, lean forward on the screen while she's saying
[15:33.120 --> 15:38.280]  this. Knowing 99% of Americans don't know that's the original name of the first Marxist
[15:38.280 --> 15:43.820]  newspaper and their slogan, Karl Marx slogan.
[15:43.820 --> 15:48.660]  I mean, they're just hitting us, hitting us hard. And like they said, hey, while you're
[15:48.660 --> 15:54.200]  watching your football buddy, we got your kids. We got your kids. We got your kids.
[15:54.200 --> 15:58.140]  We got your kids. We got your kids. And now they're taking veterans kids who've had an
[15:58.140 --> 16:00.120]  arm or leg blown off saying they're depressed.
[16:00.120 --> 16:04.480]  Now they're taking people's guns if they have one marijuana cigarette and their kids. These
[16:04.480 --> 16:10.440]  are authoritarians. This is a persecution taking place.
[16:10.440 --> 16:14.820]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights
[16:14.820 --> 16:19.960]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[16:19.960 --> 16:25.460]  elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half
[16:25.460 --> 16:28.880]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[16:28.880 --> 16:32.600]  Now there are hundreds of great products at info wars team dot com, but I want to point

[20:14.840 --> 20:28.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network. He aligns himself with the truth.
[20:28.040 --> 20:36.320]  It is time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones. Here's an example
[20:36.320 --> 20:41.360]  of the total information overload. If you're up at info awards.com, I have a link to a
[20:41.360 --> 20:49.280]  Fox News story about an FBI police training manual. This has also been issued to the U.S.
[20:49.280 --> 20:55.160]  Army training instructor listed for domestic operations. Of course, that's completely illegal
[20:55.160 --> 21:01.040]  in a free country, but we're just seeing the end of posse commentatas. Army labels evangelical
[21:01.040 --> 21:08.120]  Christians, Catholics, period. Period. Catholics, Christians, period. And some Jews, religious
[21:08.120 --> 21:14.320]  extremists. And this is Fox News. Now, if you watch my film Road to Tyranny from 2002,
[21:14.320 --> 21:20.400]  we show the same manuals, just the older versions. And people would see that and say, this isn't
[21:20.400 --> 21:26.360]  true. I would show Marines training to confiscate guns and admitting that it's for America.
[21:26.360 --> 21:31.120]  People say there's no way that's gotta be fake. When it was clearly thousands of Marines,
[21:31.120 --> 21:38.180]  Hebron, Maryland, on the East Coast, West Coast, no way it's fake. Look at that, Fox
[21:38.180 --> 21:45.960]  News. Army labels evangelicals as religious extremists. Boom, you can click and read the
[21:45.960 --> 21:56.080]  Army training manual. And ladies and gentlemen, it just says, point blank, evangelical Christianity,
[21:56.080 --> 22:06.640]  Orthodox Jews, next to an Al-Qaeda.
[22:06.640 --> 22:10.000]  Which by the way, the AP announced they're not gonna call them Al-Qaeda anymore, or even
[22:10.000 --> 22:15.520]  Islamists cuz they were using them in Libya and Syria. They got Hamas, Ku Klux Klan next
[22:15.520 --> 22:22.120]  to Christian. Catholicism, period, is extreme. You're like, well, that's incredible. And
[22:22.120 --> 22:27.240]  if you're Islamophobic, see how they're gonna totally flip it?
[22:27.240 --> 22:31.360]  That guys, I printed in IMs and I don't see it in my stack. Type in Army trains to take
[22:31.360 --> 22:37.200]  on Tea Party, it's Forbes. I wanna show people that. The Army's main mission, this is official
[22:37.200 --> 22:42.600]  from West Point, and the Army War College is to take on gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[22:42.600 --> 22:46.880]  By the way, you're not tuning in to satire here. This is what it's like to be under a
[22:46.880 --> 22:52.560]  revolution. The globalists are involved in a revolution, in a takeover. They call us
[22:52.560 --> 22:56.160]  in their higher level Ford Foundation manuals and in the different hearings that have come
[22:56.160 --> 22:57.160]  out with the weathermen.
[22:57.160 --> 23:00.600]  They call us counter revolutionaries, and you better believe that's what we are. We're
[23:00.600 --> 23:06.560]  the Americans. There it is, how the US military would crush a Tea Party rebellion. And it
[23:06.560 --> 23:11.100]  goes on to talk about how in the new Army War College, and they're even teaching this
[23:11.100 --> 23:19.000]  at West Point, their main mission. Now listen, I'm reading you Fox News right now and Forbes.
[23:19.000 --> 23:24.560]  In fact, guys, if you're watching on TV, you can see this. Go back to my screen, foxnews.com.
[23:24.560 --> 23:30.720]  Now again, I would tell people this. I would tell program directors this, big vice presidents
[23:30.720 --> 23:35.600]  at major networks, presidents, and they would say, Alex, it's not that bad. And I'd say,
[23:35.600 --> 23:36.800]  I've got the training manual.
[23:36.800 --> 23:39.800]  A few years ago, I had Nightline here trying to show them this. They go, we're not gonna
[23:39.800 --> 23:51.420]  look at it. Look at this. Catholicism, period, is extreme and next to Al Qaeda. Evangelical
[23:51.420 --> 24:00.400]  Christian, period, terrorism. And they've got it right next to Al Qaeda and the Al Qaeda
[24:00.400 --> 24:01.400]  flag.
[24:01.400 --> 24:06.640]  I mean, this is America. Ladies and gentlemen, I wasn't even intending to get to this today.
[24:06.640 --> 24:11.560]  Now, let me tell you, who are the extremists? Is it Catholics and Protestants, people with
[24:11.560 --> 24:15.800]  the lowest crime rates out there, or people that are church attending? The fbi.gov has
[24:15.800 --> 24:19.000]  all the numbers. They know somebody, whether they be Catholic or Protestant, whatever it
[24:19.000 --> 24:23.080]  is, that attends church on a regular basis, has the lowest crime rate out there for whatever
[24:23.080 --> 24:24.080]  reason.
[24:24.080 --> 24:27.460]  They know veterans have one of the lowest crime rates out there. Just the media hypes
[24:27.460 --> 24:33.600]  up when there are events. They know white males have the lowest crime rate of a, quote,
[24:33.600 --> 24:40.960]  racial group in this country, period. And we're listed as the number one terror threat.
[24:40.960 --> 24:49.520]  Now, you gotta have some bad guys to be saying this, okay? Look, it's like when I got video
[24:49.520 --> 24:53.760]  of FEMA that the police sent me, a firefighter sent me his police and firefighters in Kansas
[24:53.760 --> 24:57.640]  City, were then badmouthing George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and saying they were terrorists.
[24:57.640 --> 25:01.380]  And anybody that likes the Constitution's a terrorist, I got 18 hours of this.
[25:01.380 --> 25:07.200]  People didn't believe it, even though I had the training manuals when it was said. Now
[25:07.200 --> 25:10.640]  it's Fox News, you're gonna believe me? Listen, I stand with George Washington and Thomas
[25:10.640 --> 25:14.360]  Jefferson, and I stand with Jesus Christ. And if you wanna say I'm a terrorist, you're
[25:14.360 --> 25:15.840]  the terrorist, period.
[25:15.840 --> 25:23.160]  I have, knock on wood, no criminal record. I've probably been arrested seven, eight times
[25:23.160 --> 25:29.680]  as a juvenile in fights, but it was always found I didn't start them. But I'm a good
[25:29.680 --> 25:33.600]  person, okay? I love my family. I walk old ladies across the street.
[25:33.600 --> 25:37.280]  You know, Alex Jones, you piece of garbage.
[25:37.280 --> 25:49.060]  Excuse me. Anyways, the point is I'm listed, you're listed as an extremist. You know why
[25:49.060 --> 25:53.800]  I'm dangerous, ladies and gentlemen, to the entire power structure? It's because I simply
[25:53.800 --> 25:54.800]  am old fashioned.
[25:54.800 --> 25:59.200]  I'm a throwback, and I can see traitorous criminal activity when it's sitting in my
[25:59.200 --> 26:04.340]  living room. I go to the zoo, I go, that's an elephant, that's a tiger, that's a lion,
[26:04.340 --> 26:08.320]  that's a penguin, that's a grizzly bear. But you tell the general public, they tell them
[26:08.320 --> 26:13.160]  a lion is a Easter bunny, they'd believe it.
[26:13.160 --> 26:24.320]  And now they've got MSNBC host Melissa Harris Perry saying your children belong to the state.
[26:24.320 --> 26:30.920]  Folks, they've always been teaching that for really 100 years in the progressive movement
[26:30.920 --> 26:39.280]  in this country. 100 years. And the weird thing about it is they're not even well-meaning
[26:39.280 --> 26:44.960]  idiot liberals. These are hardcore eugenicist authoritarians that know exactly what they're
[26:44.960 --> 26:45.960]  doing.
[26:45.960 --> 26:49.680]  Do we have her cued up? Let's play. This isn't a promo. This isn't on a show where she just
[26:49.680 --> 26:54.360]  showed us what she really thought. They're running this every two hours. I looked it
[26:54.360 --> 26:59.160]  up. Tune in, boom, it was on there. They're running promos. See, people say, be nice,
[26:59.160 --> 27:05.040]  be for gay marriage. I personally have nothing against people for their passions and what
[27:05.040 --> 27:06.840]  they're into, okay?
[27:06.840 --> 27:12.400]  I don't judge people. My issue is, though, it is the quote gay and lesbian lobby, the
[27:12.400 --> 27:16.200]  dominant ones, that are always bad mouthing the family and wanting to teach sex ed to
[27:16.200 --> 27:22.480]  five-year-olds. I mean, the UN wants to teach masturbation to five-year-olds. That's pedophilia.
[27:22.480 --> 27:26.880]  So the issue is, you see, this is all part of an attack on the family, discrimination
[27:26.880 --> 27:31.800]  against men and women, to break up our society, to make us alone so the state is our mommy
[27:31.800 --> 27:32.800]  and daddy.
[27:32.800 --> 27:38.520]  That's what the communist, the fascist, this is what they do. It's like going to a football
[27:38.520 --> 27:42.880]  game and 11 people line up on each side and they've got a pig skin and it's football.
[27:42.880 --> 27:49.120]  Well, this is tyranny. It looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it is. There it is, UN
[27:49.120 --> 27:54.120]  wants to teach preschoolers about masturbation. I'm sorry, it's even below five. I mean, in
[27:54.120 --> 27:59.000]  fact, they do it in America. Remember when you were a kid in kindergarten, you went and
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.080]  took a nap after lunch, 15 minutes?
[28:01.080 --> 28:06.260]  That's not what happens now. The pedo, pedo teacher teaches that, but it's the state,
[28:06.260 --> 28:11.120]  so it's okay. But then if you take a photo of your daughters, you always see these cases,
[28:11.120 --> 28:16.720]  your son in their towel. And one girl's hugging the other girl, they're both in different
[28:16.720 --> 28:20.640]  towels, they arrest the parents and take their kids, and then they don't ever get them back.
[28:20.640 --> 28:24.680]  Or you get pulled over and they find a bowl of marijuana, which is certainly a lot better
[28:24.680 --> 28:29.000]  than alcohol, and I don't even like pottery, period. I like alcohol, quite frankly. The
[28:29.000 --> 28:33.880]  point is they take your kids. I did a video about this showing a few news articles about
[28:33.880 --> 28:37.360]  people having their kids taken for a bowl of marijuana.
[28:37.360 --> 28:41.040]  Even if it's true, they shouldn't get in trouble for it when the government ships in the hard
[28:41.040 --> 28:49.040]  drugs. We're going to go to break here in just a moment. And people are all in the comments
[28:49.040 --> 28:51.920]  on YouTube going, yeah, it happened to me. It happened to my brother. They take over
[28:51.920 --> 28:58.920]  a million and a half kids every year in this country. But if a kid's really getting hurt,
[28:58.920 --> 29:03.080]  they leave them with their bad parents. They want good kids to adopt out. They're targeting
[29:03.080 --> 29:10.560]  good families. We'll be back.
[29:10.560 --> 29:15.320]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms. But if you don't have a home security
[29:15.320 --> 29:20.080]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When
[29:20.080 --> 29:25.520]  you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders? Check out SimpliSafe. It's

[30:10.080 --> 30:15.600]  In the last 2 years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[30:15.600 --> 30:20.360]  and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[30:20.360 --> 30:24.760]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[30:24.760 --> 30:29.280]  sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is, you are.

[31:50.240 --> 31:55.320]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the

[33:28.360 --> 33:35.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN
[33:35.800 --> 33:36.800]  radio network.
[33:36.800 --> 33:43.800]  So the US military, the FBI, local police are all taught that gun owners are extreme
[33:43.800 --> 33:48.480]  terrorists, that Christians are extreme terrorists, that returning veterans are the number one
[33:48.480 --> 33:53.800]  terror threat in America. Because the globalists have set up the fifth branch of the military
[33:53.800 --> 33:58.200]  under NORTHCOM Homeland Security. It's buying billions of bullets, armored vehicles. It's
[33:58.200 --> 34:02.300]  openly preparing for the complete overthrow of our republic.
[34:02.300 --> 34:06.200]  And they've got people on TV saying the state controls your children. They've been putting
[34:06.200 --> 34:11.280]  jostling elders back on TV. Back in the 90s, we found a clip of it coming up. She's like,
[34:11.280 --> 34:18.760]  teach kids how to masturbate. Now she's on TV going, reach down and help the little kindergartners.
[34:18.760 --> 34:27.680]  And again, this is the type of garbage that is happening and going on here in this country.
[34:27.680 --> 34:35.720]  And it's now time that we understand they're over the top on purpose to just shock you
[34:35.720 --> 34:40.960]  into a mass Stockholm syndrome or learned helplessness, a normalcy bias.
[34:40.960 --> 34:45.560]  A normalcy bias is, and I've used this example 1000 times. If you could teleport 1000 years
[34:45.560 --> 34:49.960]  back to what's Mexico City today and they were sacrificing dozens of people every day
[34:49.960 --> 34:53.280]  when the sun came up and when it went down and when the moon came out. And on certain
[34:53.280 --> 34:58.760]  holidays, thousands of people and the priests made their money off selling the humans hanging
[34:58.760 --> 35:00.640]  up by their feet.
[35:00.640 --> 35:06.080]  When meat was the main food, you would say this is crazy. And they would say, we're gonna
[35:06.080 --> 35:12.900]  sacrifice you, buddy, okay? Because you're crazy, we do this, this is normal. If you
[35:12.900 --> 35:17.800]  teleported back to 1944 to a Nazi death camp, where they were lining up men, women and children
[35:17.800 --> 35:23.020]  and shooting them in pits, and you said this is wrong, they would think you were crazy.
[35:23.020 --> 35:27.720]  And so now they're like, hey, the state's gonna take your kids. And any excuse we get,
[35:27.720 --> 35:31.360]  we catch you drinking two beers and driving, your kids are gone. We catch you with marijuana,
[35:31.360 --> 35:34.720]  your kids are gone. You got a leg blown off, we're gonna say you're depressed, you're a
[35:34.720 --> 35:37.360]  military vet, we're gonna take your kids.
[35:37.360 --> 35:40.640]  Millions of vets are getting letters saying you can't own guns anymore. This is happening
[35:40.640 --> 35:46.240]  right now, and it's not even a news issue. And they come out and say, yeah, we're trying
[35:46.240 --> 35:51.440]  to take on the Tea Party now, that's what Homeland Security is for. Yeah, we're training
[35:51.440 --> 35:57.120]  to do all this, they're throwing it all in your face big time.
[35:57.120 --> 36:02.560]  Now let's go ahead and go to this clip, MSNBC host, your kids belong to the collective.
[36:02.560 --> 36:12.480]  This article is up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Right now, LinkedIn Red. MSNBC host, your
[36:12.480 --> 36:19.560]  kids belong to the collective. And folks, this is every day, okay, every day there's
[36:19.560 --> 36:20.560]  stuff like this.
[36:20.560 --> 36:27.760]  This is in a promo, they're officially running. And MSNBC is full of White House operatives,
[36:27.760 --> 36:32.600]  so is media matters. And who do they attack every day? You guessed it, Alex Jones, calling
[36:32.600 --> 36:38.200]  me an extremist because I don't believe Catholics and Protestants are extremist terrorists.
[36:38.200 --> 36:41.320]  Because I don't believe the founding fathers were bad people, they were amazing. Because
[36:41.320 --> 36:47.680]  I don't believe it's a good thing to take the citizens' guns when more guns means less
[36:47.680 --> 36:50.880]  crime. What I know, we have authoritarians taking over.
[36:50.880 --> 36:55.680]  You go to the front page of infowars.com, I typed in Hitler Youth. I have a famous Nazi
[36:55.680 --> 37:00.800]  poster of Hitler with the children. And remember, he said, when an opponent declares I will
[37:00.800 --> 37:06.680]  not come over to your side, I calmly say, your child belongs to us already.
[37:06.680 --> 37:12.520]  What are you? See, you're little, you're nobody. You will pass on. Your descendants, however,
[37:12.520 --> 37:21.080]  now stand in the new camp. In a short time, they will know nothing else but the new community.
[37:21.080 --> 37:25.440]  And that's what the MSNBC host is saying. See, once they collectivize you with collectivist
[37:25.440 --> 37:29.680]  health care, collectivist education, they can then argue, hey, we gotta say what you
[37:29.680 --> 37:34.600]  can eat, what you can drink, where you go, what you do, cuz we're all paying for it.
[37:34.600 --> 37:40.560]  Forcing you to go on welfare, forcing you to get into the system with corporate contracts.
[37:40.560 --> 37:46.380]  It's all about control, because they want the control. And good people don't want control.
[37:46.380 --> 37:49.960]  We don't wanna go to city council. We don't wanna go run for state rep. We don't want
[37:49.960 --> 37:55.600]  power. We're quietly confident, inwardly secure. We're embarrassed by people that dress up
[37:55.600 --> 37:57.960]  like peacocks and are into all this garbage.
[37:57.960 --> 38:02.320]  Well, you know what? If we don't take control through the Republic and restore the Republic,
[38:02.320 --> 38:06.800]  the very worst will take over. See, once you get a corrupt group in, they get overthrown
[38:06.800 --> 38:10.840]  by the next group that's even more corrupt, and then even more corrupt, and then even
[38:10.840 --> 38:11.840]  more corrupt.
[38:11.840 --> 38:16.920]  And whether it was the Babylonians, or whether it was the Druids, or whether it was African
[38:16.920 --> 38:24.180]  animus tribes, or whether it was Mesoamerican Aztecs and Mayan groups, Toltecs and others.
[38:24.180 --> 38:29.960]  Every culture, every culture from the Vikings to the Greeks, they don't really teach that
[38:29.960 --> 38:32.000]  in popular history, but it's buried.
[38:32.000 --> 38:37.360]  They would just burn your wife with you if you died, the Vikings. Gladiatorial events
[38:37.360 --> 38:42.000]  with the Greeks and Romans started when the man of the house would die. They'd have a
[38:42.000 --> 38:47.280]  few of the slaves kill each other in combat, ritually, because he was a warrior at the
[38:47.280 --> 38:50.980]  funeral pyre. That's human sacrifice.
[38:50.980 --> 38:57.160]  Every culture ends with crazy people, psychos, get in control, and they demand human sacrifice.
[38:57.160 --> 39:03.440]  Every culture, that's the bottom of the rabbit hole. Ritualized mass death and where your
[39:03.440 --> 39:07.440]  neighbor's being torn apart in the arena this week, you'll be torn apart next week and no
[39:07.440 --> 39:10.720]  one has empathy and civilization finally implodes.
[39:10.720 --> 39:16.020]  In fact, that's not the final step. Human sacrifice, gladiatorial events is not the
[39:16.020 --> 39:22.420]  final step. It's the final step before everything collapses. Because then the only next decadent
[39:22.420 --> 39:28.560]  thing the leadership can do is launch wars they can't win or commit suicide.
[39:28.560 --> 39:33.080]  The Roman emperors, Caligula and others, and that was long before the collapse, would kill
[39:33.080 --> 39:39.320]  themselves, kill their family. Nero, again, would go to those Roman parties where they
[39:39.320 --> 39:44.000]  had vomitariums where they would eat till they vomited over and over again. And he would
[39:44.000 --> 39:48.240]  dress as a werewolf and tie small children to a pole, pull this up, written about by
[39:48.240 --> 39:52.680]  mainline Roman history. And he would go and tear children's throats out with blood spraying
[39:52.680 --> 39:54.080]  all over him.
[39:54.080 --> 40:00.640]  That's North Korea, folks, that's the state is God. A little stunted pot-bellied wimp
[40:00.640 --> 40:05.560]  ruling everything. We got a frontline report from North Korea with the guy that did the
[40:05.560 --> 40:10.400]  Camp David Accords, the top psychiatrist, the Harvard psychiatrist. The guy that co-wrote
[40:10.400 --> 40:17.160]  Tom Clancy's books, very famous living psych warfare specialist, probably one of the biggest
[40:17.160 --> 40:19.640]  out there, overthrown countries, you name it.
[40:19.640 --> 40:25.160]  He was involved in the transition of South Korea from a military dictatorship in the
[40:25.160 --> 40:32.240]  70s to what it is today, the industrial engine of Asia, and really the world per capita.
[40:32.240 --> 40:37.480]  He's there on the DMZ. He's gonna be talking to us about that whole crisis that is, again,
[40:37.480 --> 40:39.140]  out of control government on power trips.
[40:39.140 --> 40:45.720]  But let's go to this clip, MSNBC host, your kids belong to the collective, here it is.
[40:45.720 --> 40:50.440]  We have never invested as much in public education as we should have because we've always had
[40:50.440 --> 40:55.860]  kind of a private notion of children. Your kid is yours and totally your responsibility.
[40:55.860 --> 40:59.960]  We haven't had a very collective notion of these are our children. So part of it is we
[40:59.960 --> 41:04.040]  have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or
[41:04.040 --> 41:07.720]  kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[41:07.720 --> 41:11.720]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making
[41:11.720 --> 41:14.300]  better investments.
[41:14.300 --> 41:22.200]  When you had elders back under Clinton, the Surgeon General, and he's even back on TV,
[41:22.200 --> 41:26.680]  out there saying the government needs to reach down and help the kids learn how to do this.
[41:26.680 --> 41:30.880]  Now if you went in a public bathroom and ran up to a kid and grabbed their crotch, you'd
[41:30.880 --> 41:32.820]  go to prison for 50 years and you should.
[41:32.820 --> 41:37.360]  But if the state, this goes on all over America, you can't stop them, they're the government
[41:37.360 --> 41:41.180]  unless you fully wake up to them. They're in there teaching kids how to masturbate.
[41:41.180 --> 41:45.120]  Because the truth is they're a bunch of pervs. Most of these people that want power have
[41:45.120 --> 41:49.200]  never really lived and never gone through the rights of combat growing up when they're
[41:49.200 --> 41:52.220]  young and don't come from good families.
[41:52.220 --> 41:56.760]  Big government's kind of a collection of scum. So are corporate swarms. They're like weak
[41:56.760 --> 42:01.500]  people that hate the strong and people that aren't politically developed and things. They're
[42:01.500 --> 42:07.440]  usually sexually crushed as well. So they're at the level of a child or they're pure Satanists
[42:07.440 --> 42:11.720]  like to abuse children. And that's why they wanna put their hands on your kids.
[42:11.720 --> 42:15.160]  And they're gonna take them from you cuz you're a veteran or you're a pot smoker, and they're
[42:15.160 --> 42:19.840]  gonna hurt them. You're seven times more likely now, it was five times, it was three times
[42:19.840 --> 42:24.560]  a few decades ago, more likely to be abused in government custody as a child than anywhere
[42:24.560 --> 42:27.240]  else. The most dangerous place is for a child in government.
[42:27.240 --> 42:32.360]  Who do you think gets into government agencies to be around kids? I mean, I told you the
[42:32.360 --> 42:36.480]  whole Sandusky thing, it was the whole top of the university, that's now come out. The
[42:36.480 --> 42:40.620]  connections to the National Security Agency, look it up. They can't bring it down because
[42:40.620 --> 42:43.840]  the whole thing, it's a pedophile guilt.
[42:43.840 --> 42:48.200]  They want your kids, folks. They didn't have them, they didn't raise them, they don't love
[42:48.200 --> 42:52.560]  them. They're sick freaks. Children are so good and so innocent to these demons, they
[42:52.560 --> 42:58.300]  wanna hurt them. And so they say they belong to them. Now I've got clips coming back where
[42:58.300 --> 43:01.700]  they say you've gotta do national service, paying taxes isn't enough. They're gonna make
[43:01.700 --> 43:02.700]  you their slaves.
[43:02.700 --> 43:09.920]  We'll be right back.
[43:09.920 --> 43:14.400]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial
[43:14.400 --> 43:19.480]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies. As a result, millions
[43:19.480 --> 43:24.640]  are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons. But how will these items help if you or one of
[43:24.640 --> 43:29.840]  your loved ones becomes ill? Supernatural Silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you

[44:09.400 --> 44:14.560]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011,
[44:14.560 --> 44:19.800]  storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[44:19.800 --> 44:24.080]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[44:24.080 --> 44:28.600]  sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are.

[47:09.080 --> 47:20.920]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:20.920 --> 47:28.400]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[47:28.400 --> 47:44.360]  Nobody rides for free. Nobody rides for free. Nobody rides for free. Nobody rides for free.
[47:44.360 --> 47:48.060]  And that's a clip I'm gonna play here in a moment is Rahm Emanuel saying everyone will
[47:48.060 --> 47:52.220]  serve under national service and that's part of the FEMA core official charter.
[47:52.220 --> 47:56.160]  They're now graduating high schoolers and college people who want to get government
[47:56.160 --> 48:01.440]  funding in their new little uniforms. They train in things like warrant service and gun
[48:01.440 --> 48:06.460]  confiscation. And it's all official, giant black armored vehicles are being bought by
[48:06.460 --> 48:13.660]  the thousands, the bullets, ATF just put out a new federal bid for data mining stuff to
[48:13.660 --> 48:18.860]  spy on citizens, web traffic without warrants.
[48:18.860 --> 48:24.880]  And meanwhile, they'll probably just come out and say it doesn't exist. There's no bullets,
[48:24.880 --> 48:31.560]  there's no armored vehicles. We're not warrantlessly spying on you, but we are, but we are. The
[48:31.560 --> 48:36.720]  state doesn't wanna take your kids. I saw a case two years ago in homeschooling, California
[48:36.720 --> 48:43.720]  banned it with a law unless you had a state teaching certificate, a degree in teaching.
[48:43.720 --> 48:47.320]  Doesn't matter of homeschoolers when all the spelling bees and colleges crave them and
[48:47.320 --> 48:51.520]  they have the highest test scores on average per capita worldwide.
[48:51.520 --> 48:55.600]  Rights don't matter. The state said in the court hearing, they said, well, the state
[48:55.600 --> 49:00.360]  now controls the children and is the guardian over the parents period, not just when they're
[49:00.360 --> 49:06.080]  at school. Now the court struck that down. But the state argued in California, they run
[49:06.080 --> 49:07.080]  your kids.
[49:07.080 --> 49:11.760]  Kinda like California gives inoculations without parental consent saying we are the guardian
[49:11.760 --> 49:18.640]  now. I mean, incredible. And you're like, well, the shots are to keep us safe. Uh-huh,
[49:18.640 --> 49:24.440]  have you read what the insert says, folks? It's amazing. So I've played the clip of MSNBC
[49:24.440 --> 49:29.200]  in a commercial saying your kids aren't your kids, we've gotta get past this idea.
[49:29.200 --> 49:34.040]  This private idea that your kids are your kids, they're not, they're the collectives.
[49:34.040 --> 49:40.560]  And then you've got Rahm Emanuel saying, you've got to serve. If you actually read the plan,
[49:40.560 --> 49:46.680]  it's three months every year up until you're 60 something. That's in the official legislation
[49:46.680 --> 49:52.800]  they brought in. But publicly on C-SPAN, he says, a few months every year, this is what
[49:52.800 --> 49:53.800]  they're planning.
[49:53.800 --> 49:58.760]  But first, here's Obama. He said this five years ago, campaigning his domestic security
[49:58.760 --> 50:04.440]  force. And by the way, it's out there now. Clergy response team, preachers that spy on
[50:04.440 --> 50:09.840]  you, infra-guard, business people that spy on you. It's directly out of the Soviet Union,
[50:09.840 --> 50:10.840]  here it is.
[50:10.840 --> 50:17.040]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security
[50:17.040 --> 50:21.680]  objectives that we've set. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's
[50:21.680 --> 50:28.480]  just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[50:28.480 --> 50:37.280]  If you had 20 traits that you went down a checklist of a tyranny, all 20 are completely
[50:37.280 --> 50:45.880]  checked right out of a textbook. This is like me going to a NASCAR race, and NASCARs are
[50:45.880 --> 50:51.160]  going around and you go, what is this? And I go, it's a NASCAR race. Conspiracy theorist,
[50:51.160 --> 50:56.600]  yeah, yeah, 30 some percent of Americans in the public policy poll.
[50:56.600 --> 51:03.220]  It's way above that, the Democratic Party operative group on record.
[51:03.220 --> 51:07.360]  They believe in the imaginary New World Order. Imagine the question, do you believe in the
[51:07.360 --> 51:13.360]  imaginary New World Order conspiracy theory? Well, no, I don't believe in the imaginary
[51:13.360 --> 51:17.760]  corporate world government run by mega banks that are bragging they've set up world government
[51:17.760 --> 51:18.760]  everywhere.
[51:18.760 --> 51:23.580]  And there it is, Business Insider, a ridiculous number of Americans believe in crazy conspiracy
[51:23.580 --> 51:28.680]  theories like a New World Order, new public policy poll shows. First though, let's go
[51:28.680 --> 51:33.480]  to Rahm Emanuel, because I tell people they're already establishing national compulsory service,
[51:33.480 --> 51:38.720]  not enough to pay if you actually work more than 60% in some form of tax.
[51:38.720 --> 51:44.680]  Now you got to do more to be a citizen. You've got to serve domestically. Again, they want
[51:44.680 --> 51:49.800]  our guns, but their people, their new Jugend, they're going to be armed. Here it is.
[51:49.800 --> 51:54.820]  Citizenship is not an entitlement program. It comes with responsibilities. Everybody
[51:54.820 --> 51:59.480]  somewhere between the ages of 18 and 25 will serve three months of basic training and understanding
[51:59.480 --> 52:04.360]  in a kind of civil defense. That universal sense of service somewhere between the ages
[52:04.360 --> 52:09.440]  of 18 and 25 will give Americans once again, a sense of what they are to be American and
[52:09.440 --> 52:13.440]  their contribution to a country and a common experience.
[52:13.440 --> 52:17.760]  By the way, I was in the Civil Air Patrol. My dad was really involved in it growing up.
[52:17.760 --> 52:21.320]  That's why I was involved in it. But, you know, we go flying around and stuff when there
[52:21.320 --> 52:25.600]  was fires and stuff, spotting or on rescue missions, he mainly did that. But I was into
[52:25.600 --> 52:33.280]  it somewhat. And back then it was truly civil defense, the people organized, and then they
[52:33.280 --> 52:35.720]  would just be called upon in missions and emergencies.
[52:35.720 --> 52:39.240]  They're getting rid of that in the Civil Air Patrol. It's all under Homeland Security,
[52:39.240 --> 52:44.800]  all under the Air Force, and it's all real creepy. Spy on this, spy on that. Again, that's
[52:44.800 --> 52:49.420]  totally converting. I've talked to folks I know that are still in it. Again, you're not
[52:49.420 --> 52:53.600]  trusted in this unless you're part of their group because it's a foreign takeover.
[52:53.600 --> 52:59.560]  Remember, the Army's now taught for domestic operations, Catholics period, Evangelical
[52:59.560 --> 53:08.240]  Christians period, are extremist terrorists. I just showed you Fox News. Now, again, ladies
[53:08.240 --> 53:15.120]  and gentlemen, this is what we've come to. Now let's play Biden. This was on Friday,
[53:15.120 --> 53:19.720]  Vice President Joe Biden threw caution to the wind as he shockingly declared the affirmative
[53:19.720 --> 53:22.600]  task we now have is to actively create a new world order.
[53:22.600 --> 53:29.080]  He said this is the big import-export trade federal event, adding yet another admission
[53:29.080 --> 53:34.480]  to the already long list of documented globalist bragging of plans for a centralized one-world
[53:34.480 --> 53:39.700]  government at the Export-Import Bank Conference in Washington. I'm gonna play the clip here,
[53:39.700 --> 53:46.260]  but the issue is I did a special report last week because the media was saying there's
[53:46.260 --> 53:49.080]  no such thing as a global government with scores of clips.
[53:49.080 --> 53:53.840]  You can just type in bankers declare they've conquered America and Europe, and then you'll
[53:53.840 --> 53:59.460]  find some of the clips. But I put it all in one report where they're all announcing global
[53:59.460 --> 54:03.960]  government, we engineered the financial crisis. We're gonna implode the world economy, bring
[54:03.960 --> 54:09.540]  in a cashless society, SDR. We're gonna need 100 trillion in taxes a year. This is Davos
[54:09.540 --> 54:10.540]  on C-SPAN.
[54:10.540 --> 54:15.340]  I mean, I sit there for hours and just my wife's like, can we watch a movie? And I'm
[54:15.340 --> 54:21.100]  watching all the world leaders like a public Bilderberg meeting, which people like Lindbeck
[54:21.100 --> 54:24.800]  says, don't exist, I'm bad to cover it. I'm like, man, come on, cover the whole thing,
[54:24.800 --> 54:26.600]  bro, don't be afraid.
[54:26.600 --> 54:33.280]  And I'm watching them say all this, I mean, guys type in, banks want 100 trillion in new
[54:33.280 --> 54:39.120]  liquidity, in new credit, which means our tax money. And they're announcing what the
[54:39.120 --> 54:43.920]  world government is, an autocratic centralized government run by private mega banks. The
[54:43.920 --> 54:48.260]  Financial Times of London four years ago wrote a headline, and now for world government,
[54:48.260 --> 54:50.480]  their foreign editor, Bilderberg group attendee.
[54:50.480 --> 54:55.120]  And he says, yeah, we're autocratic, we're authoritarian, we've been secretive, but we
[54:55.120 --> 55:00.520]  know best, we're taking over. He admits in the article, okay, you've exposed us, doesn't
[55:00.520 --> 55:05.240]  matter, you wanna join us. I mean, I've had Rothkop, the head of the Kissinger group,
[55:05.240 --> 55:06.240]  on my show.
[55:06.240 --> 55:08.560]  And I said, why'd you come on my show during the break? And he goes, I wanna convince you
[55:08.560 --> 55:12.320]  we're the right way to go, Mr. Jones. And you're a very important person, you're part
[55:12.320 --> 55:17.520]  of the super class in your own way, leading the resistance. So you could do well, we'd
[55:17.520 --> 55:18.960]  like to hear what you have to say.
[55:18.960 --> 55:23.440]  And I could instantly go join them and I'd be a US Senator or whatever, or I'd be the
[55:23.440 --> 55:28.380]  next Rush Limbaugh, okay? If you just engage them and be their buddy, do you know how real
[55:28.380 --> 55:34.720]  all this is? All reason I can tell you the Rothkop story is when they tell me this stuff
[55:34.720 --> 55:39.920]  is off record now? Cuz I have a journalist hat, I can't talk about it if it's off record.
[55:39.920 --> 55:43.360]  I can talk about it cuz Rothkop, they're on the phone line, during the breaks talking
[55:43.360 --> 55:47.760]  to me, John Harmon's hearing the whole thing five years ago. He wrote super class bragging
[55:47.760 --> 55:48.760]  about all this.
[55:48.760 --> 55:53.520]  And he's like, no, I don't care if you say that I say you ought to work with us, we're
[55:53.520 --> 55:59.800]  trying to save the world. Well, the answer is no, you're not, no, you're not. You're
[55:59.800 --> 56:04.080]  destroying the family, you're bringing in tyranny, and I've had enough of it. So here's
[56:04.080 --> 56:08.960]  Biden saying new world order, there it is, world needs 100 trillion more credit a decade,
[56:08.960 --> 56:10.520]  says World Economic Forum.
[56:10.520 --> 56:17.440]  When you read it, it's a tax to them. They wanna shut down productivity, folks. It's
[56:17.440 --> 56:22.680]  incredible. And then their propaganda say they're saving the world. Here is Biden calling
[56:22.680 --> 56:28.080]  for a new world order, and they define it in the whole speech as a global economic system
[56:28.080 --> 56:30.880]  controlled by private banks. Here it is.
[56:30.880 --> 56:41.080]  The affirmative task we have now is to actually create a new world order, because the global
[56:41.080 --> 56:46.840]  order is changing again. And the institution is the rule that worked so well in the post
[56:46.840 --> 56:52.800]  World War II era for decades, they need to be strengthened, and some have to be changed.
[56:52.800 --> 56:58.160]  So we have to do what we do best. We have to lead. We have to lead. We have to update
[56:58.160 --> 57:04.360]  the global rules of the road. We have to do it in a way that maximize benefits for everyone.
[57:04.360 --> 57:09.560]  You know, if you go pull up my clip, it's up on infowars.com. Here, let me actually
[57:09.560 --> 57:14.680]  pull it up. Give you the exact name. It's got scores of clips where they say, this is
[57:14.680 --> 57:20.940]  global governance. This is world government. It's the War on Reality Special Report. That's
[57:20.940 --> 57:24.960]  the name of it. And if you just type that in the War on Reality Special Report, I'll
[57:24.960 --> 57:29.880]  get the Webmaster, the Sunday crew to repost that up at the top of infowars.com. I have
[57:29.880 --> 57:33.960]  them defining. They go, what is new world order? It is global governance run by private
[57:33.960 --> 57:39.640]  central banks, head of the EU, head of Britain, head of the US. They say this at these meetings.
[57:39.640 --> 57:43.520]  I'm watching it. And they say under this, there'll be no families. They're going to
[57:43.520 --> 57:48.400]  make us live in government dormitories in 200 square foot little coffin deals. Bloomberg's
[57:48.400 --> 57:53.160]  already trying to make it the law while they're all exempt from it, living like kings. Prince
[57:53.160 --> 58:00.280]  Charles, second hour coming up. Stay with us. Report from North Korea.

[59:00.320 --> 59:05.000]  of research into why even if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving
[59:05.000 --> 59:09.920]  and my research led me to a well known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[59:09.920 --> 59:14.100]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[59:14.100 --> 59:19.800]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[59:19.800 --> 59:25.560]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin
[59:25.560 --> 59:30.480]  and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products are
[59:30.480 --> 59:35.040]  designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have
[59:35.040 --> 59:41.560]  to eat as much to be satisfied. I've lost 37 pounds in two months. Simply getting the
[59:41.560 --> 59:47.360]  vitamins and minerals I need. Check it out for yourself. It's incredible. Go to Infowarsteam.com

[59:53.040 --> 01:00:02.920]  complex dietary supplement. That's Infowarsteam.com. Coast to Coast direct from Austin. You're
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:12.120]  listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network. From his Central Texas command center deep
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:20.240]  behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:27.580]  You know, in the last hour I talked a lot about the collectivist and at the lower levels
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.920]  they're a bunch of idiots. I saw a video last week on the show and Mike Adams was sitting
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:35.880]  in the Health Ranger naturalnews.com doing a great job. He played that clip of that Colorado
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:40.120]  State Rep saying we got about 15 round mags and up because after you shoot the bullets
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:46.840]  out of them, you got to throw the mag away. They're no good anymore. And so low level,
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:52.520]  they're complete morons. The globalists mainly, it's not a conspiracy at the low level because
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:56.360]  they just get idiots that are yes men and yes women that are dumber than a box of rocks
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:02.560]  and they count on you being dumb. But higher up the collectivist are people that understand
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.480]  how humans operate.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:08.840]  And most people that learn how humans operate, they go and use it to manipulate people like
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:14.600]  their cattle just so they individually monetarily get ahead. And that's not my philosophy. My
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:20.200]  philosophy is to lift you up so that you lift up my family as well because I don't need
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:26.360]  to believe in karma, mojo, reap what you sow. I feel it. And I'm not somebody that gets
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:30.600]  jealous of a guy that has a beautiful wife or a beautiful home or writes an incredible
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.600]  book.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.040]  I admire them. And I grew up thinking everybody was like me. And I'm not saying I'm virtuous
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:40.480]  or anything either. I'm competitive as the next person. And if somebody crosses me, I
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:45.240]  have big problems with wanting to destroy them. It's just that I have a sense of justice
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:50.160]  and I'm a team player, which is the opposite of being a collectivist. I'm about the individual
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:55.240]  but also working with others to build something greater if you choose under free will.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:02:01.040]  Now, we got Dr. Pachanic. We're getting lined up here from the DMZ there in Korea to cover
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.080]  that crisis coming up. And I'll get into other news after he leaves us. But let me punch
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:09.440]  up for TV viewers. If you're a radio listener, go to infowars.com. I went and swam in the
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.840]  river today downtown, did some exercise. I only had an out time of some a mile.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:17.480]  And it's just really great. It's like the Caribbean out there. There's so many big fish
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:22.640]  and turtles and stuff. And I got out and I saw some red ants up on the hill where I parked
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.160]  and walking back up from the river. The Brazilian fire ants have come in and killed most of
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.840]  them. There's these big ants I grew up seeing.
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:36.680]  And I shot a video called of ants and men. It's linked up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:41.360]  And I just posted about an hour and a half ago, uploaded it as I drove into work from
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:48.480]  the swim. And, you know, I talk about Plato's allegory of the cave coming out of the cave.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:52.720]  And this guy says, Alex Jones believes in the philosophy of Plato, that philosopher
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:57.320]  kings must rule and should be appointed by self-proclaimed enlightened, think Illuminati
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.620]  kingmaker historically called the Emperor.
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:04.560]  This is the garbage that has spawned tyranny time and time again throughout history. Alex
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:12.760]  Jones is human garbage riding the wave of tyranny, democracy and government at the founding.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:16.680]  Democracy translate literally the people's strength. The population has armed and demanded
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.440]  rule by the will of the people.
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:27.480]  Number one, I support the republic. So I can get what you're saying that I support Plato,
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:32.600]  but not his republic. He was the original proto eugenicist. I can take some things he
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:37.480]  said and then leave others like the allegory of the cave, people in a cave looking at projections
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.740]  like a television is profound, really.
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:44.360]  And coming up out of the cave, the larger world that that I was talking about. But that
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:48.200]  doesn't mean I endorse the philosopher king because the philosopher king still builds
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:52.240]  a centralized system. And even though they can create a golden short period, corrupt
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.220]  people will take the place of the philosopher king and create the ultimate hell.
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:03.160]  But just as a republic produces so much wealth that comes out of tyranny, striving for liberty
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:08.880]  creates a great republic and wealth, then the generations become decadent. The generations
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:14.140]  become corrupted because liberty produces so much wealth, so that creates its own cycle.
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:18.840]  So I analyze the different cycles. And so just saying come out of the cave like Plato's
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:22.800]  allegory does not mean I endorse Plato.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.680]  Even though I've read, I don't know, a couple of his books. I mean, it's very interesting
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:30.800]  stuff. I first read one when I was about 12 because I heard that he wrote about Atlantis
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:35.320]  as if it was real. I wanted to see what the historian and philosopher Plato had to say.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:40.160]  But I've read the other philosophers as well. I've read Nietzsche. Doesn't mean I agree
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:46.020]  in the uber mention and having visions on the toilet. I have my visions out on top of
[01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:52.160]  rock, looking up into the stars. I have my visions watching my children play around and
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.800]  swim in the edge of the lake.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:58.160]  I have my visions thinking about all that's good. We're going to go to break here, ladies
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:03.720]  and gentlemen. And when we come back after this quick break, Dr. Steve Pechenik is on

[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:21.080]  hour and that's how we fund our operations.
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:27.120]  It is a 507 Central Standard Time. We're gonna go to Dr. Steve Pacinek. It's 7 a.m. Monday
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:35.160]  morning on the DMZ in the dividing line between North and South Korea with the global crisis,
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:40.140]  with them threatening to launch a missile and not saying if it has an atomic bomb on
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:44.720]  top of it threatening to nuke. It's weird having a weirdo dictator who reportedly has
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:48.640]  ICBMs that many doubt can actually reach the middle of the country, much less the West
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.040]  Coast, saying he wants to nuke Austin.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:57.600]  And I'm sitting here in Texas with some crazy inbred control freak, hereditary dictator
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:01.760]  who's a communist, of course, the ultimate tyranny, saying he's gonna nuke me and my
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:07.680]  family. Very, very bizarre. Dr. Steve Pacinek, one of the most famous for the hostage negotiators
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:11.760]  and crisis negotiators, helped get the Camp David Accords through.
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:16.320]  The only peace deal that ever really did anything in the Middle East. StevePacinek.com co-wrote
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:23.280]  the books with Tom Clancy and has a bunch of big Hollywood movies. He's an MD and PhD,
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:27.760]  Harvard University, MIT, very interesting guy. I gotta get him on sometime and make
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:33.520]  him talk about overthrowing countries and all the rest of it. You can pull up his name
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:37.920]  if you wanna read that. Just serious guy, amazing we have him on.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.520]  He was the first guy to expose bin Laden, was dead back in 2002. Member of the real
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:48.640]  government or was, Council on Foreign Relations. We're gonna talk to him in a second, but briefly,
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:53.800]  welcome to Planet Hoax. This is the April issue of Infowars Magazine, a great tool.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:57.960]  Everybody's getting out of print, we got into print. We dominate digital, dominate alternative
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:05.220]  news, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com. But welcome to Planet Hoax, the war on reality.
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:08.400]  This gets into the fact they denied there were drones. Now they admit they were told
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:12.160]  to lie, Robert Gibbs. They said there weren't 2 billion bullets, now they admit they were
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:17.320]  told to lie. It's full of more than ten major hoaxes. Well, actually one article is ten
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:21.600]  major hoaxes. I don't know, 20, 30, I don't know.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:28.240]  Major hoaxes at the establishment has been caught in over and over and over and over
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:33.540]  again in the new issue. You can buy them in groups of 10 up to 100 at cost, big color
[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:38.960]  glossy magazine, great way. It has the Dianne Feinstein centerfold in it. I'm not joking,
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.960]  it's an April Fool's joke. It's not pornographic, don't worry.
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:46.280]  Except that kinda makes you like Dianne Feinstein, it's her head on Betty Page with a devil tail.
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:50.820]  The point is, so maybe I don't like it. I disavow it, we won't do it again. I don't
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:54.520]  like looking at Feinstein, I'm having a good feeling. But anyways, the point is, it's in
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:10:00.240]  the new magazine, infowarstore.com. Get them in bulk, give them to people, wake folks up
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.240]  today.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:05.760]  It is an info war. You heard the MSNBC hoax, been part of the Department of Education saying
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:10.320]  the collective owns your children, like this is North Korea. No, they don't, fight back
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:16.820]  and these tyrants will dissipate like phantoms at dawn, to quote Thomas Jefferson. Okay,
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:19.920]  again going to Dr. Steve Pacinek, we're going to break here in about six minutes.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:25.700]  He's going to be with us for most of the rest of the hour, reporting from the DMZ. He was
[01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:31.340]  in the State Department, chairing that area previously, was involved with the Korean government,
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:35.640]  so he's been inserted by himself. He offered the government to go, which he's done in the
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:38.280]  past, and they didn't want his help.
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:43.340]  But he is reporting for us exclusively and at stevepacinek.com. And so he's got some
[01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:49.160]  breaking news since he talked to us Friday from the demilitarized zone. And what many
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:53.040]  analysts say could be the trigger for World War III. And the media has been saying, when
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:58.480]  we need a psychiatrist on the ground, he is a real psychiatrist, not a quack psychiatrist,
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.480]  in his own words.
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:03.880]  Doc, good to have you on with us. Tell us what the latest is from the DMZ.
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.840]  Alex, it's always a pleasure to be on and I always come on your show because there is
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:15.360]  really a reality check on what is happening. What is happening on the DMZ, it's quite cold.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:20.720]  We've had rain and we've had a lot of snow on the eastern part. What we see happening
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:27.360]  is troop movements from South Korean troops moving in tanks and young 18 to 19 year old
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:33.040]  boys in the Republic of Korean Army, which basically they have to serve about 18 to 24
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:38.080]  months mandatory service. Many of them are highly inexperienced, as many of our soldiers
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:45.160]  were in the Korean War. Some of them talked to me. Their officers tried to get them away
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:49.680]  from me. I talked to them. I asked them if they were afraid. They said yes, but are they
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:55.080]  really scared of a major war? They said they're not sure because there's so much war talk
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:00.640]  going on and war mongering that they feel that in the past this has not come to life.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:07.000]  In turn, I was able to get access to some of the most unusual of our own military, which
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.480]  is special forces. I can't identify them, but I've always had a great respect for
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:16.200]  our special forces. Since 30 years ago, I was part of really developing the special
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:22.080]  forces units out of Fort Bragg into an elite Delta Force unit and talking to them.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:26.200]  Sure. In fact, you were involved. That's on record in the creation of Delta Force. What,
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.200]  in 1979?
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:31.800]  That's correct. And what I talked to them about, and again, remember, I am not allowed
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:39.360]  to, I was forbidden by our intelligence organization, our state department, our embassy, our KCIA,
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:45.640]  whom I worked with and including the Blue House here and the ROC, Republic of Korean
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:50.600]  Army. I have been totally forbidden to access anyone, so I really am doing this on my own
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:55.400]  on behalf of you and really the American public. I'm not a hero. I'm simply doing what
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:59.240]  you're doing, although I didn't read Plato and Nietzsche, and when I did, I had to go
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:04.160]  to a textbook to see what they meant. But let me get to the point. The point here is
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:09.600]  what one of the very smart special forces soldiers said to me. He said, look, Doc, for
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:15.400]  over 20 years since the Cold War, and he knew who I was, we have not had a strategy. We
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:21.120]  have not had a complete overall world strategy. All we have been doing is reacting to situations
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:24.760]  which we sometimes create, often create through our military.
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:26.440]  So it's a rotting stalemate.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:31.800]  Well, it's not just a stalemate. We get into situations which we cannot control. And
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:35.720]  this is the problem we have now. Let me make it very clear. I have worked with the North
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:40.680]  Koreans. I have negotiated with the North Koreans. I knew Kim Jong Il. I knew Kim Oh
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:47.360]  Sung, his grandfather. And let me tell you a little bit about the notion that this media,
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:53.400]  including CNN and Wolf Blitzer, is an unsensible crew of morons who are saying that this is
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:59.200]  a black box. North Korea is not a black box. For 30 years, we have known everything about
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:03.320]  North Korea. It's not just as a psychiatrist, but there have been other colleagues of mine
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:11.120]  in the CIA, including Don Gregg, Jim Lilly, who were in the CIA and were our phenomenal
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:17.760]  ambassadors, again under Bush Sr. People underestimate how much Bush Sr. had kept things quiet. And
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:22.840]  we did not precipitate any conflicts. What happened, in effect, is we understand very
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:29.320]  well the pattern of behavior where the North Koreans, when they need help, they continuously
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:36.000]  bang-bang and then try to get us to the negotiating table when we put on a restriction on them
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.960]  or an embargo. And then they force us to try to come to a negotiating table with them and
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:45.840]  make concessions. At times, we would make concessions. Often, we would not make concessions.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:51.320]  The concessions often rotated around food. The reason food is important in North Korea
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:55.640]  and people have not emphasized this, this is a country of 22 million communists who
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:00.960]  were impoverished, not just starving, but literally impoverished. And the only thing
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:05.360]  that they can do is not come over the DMZ zone, although I do see some of them trying
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:10.560]  to approach it. I do see machine gun racks in the distance. I do see their installations
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:15.920]  of artillery guns. But I'm not worried about that because I know the military situation
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:21.440]  and the force structure of the North Koreans. And quite frankly, we in the national security
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:27.280]  area promised previously and even presently know that all of the equipment in North Korea
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.720]  is really antiquated. It's old 20-year-old Soviet equipment.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:35.520]  All right, doctor, we got a long segment coming up. We're going to come back, give you the
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:41.080]  floor to break down what you said the danger is. And here's the big question. Is this like
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:45.160]  the Berlin Wall about to fall? Could North Korea be preparing to collapse? Because this
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:49.120]  is three, four times the rhetoric we've ever seen. You agree with that Friday. What's the
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:54.560]  real danger in the West getting into this hype, using it as a domestic political diversion?
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:16:00.120]  Could this cause the implosion of North Korea into China and South Korea? What does that
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:05.540]  signify? You said Friday this could cause World War III. We'll see the real danger straight
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:08.320]  ahead and where Obama's dropping the ball.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:15.200]  You may be arrested or subject to other police action. Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:21.000]  in 1984 has become reality. It really says that the state is God. The United States is
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.240]  now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth. This film
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:32.520]  conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:36.680]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:41.600]  powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:47.680]  has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scanners,
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:53.280]  sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:58.440]  the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's

[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:39.040]  You know, before Dr. Pachinik leaves this, I want to play a clip for him of MSNBC saying
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:44.000]  your children belong to the government. I mean, this is just authoritarianism 101. They're
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.680]  really making their move. I mean, they have to move to North Korea to be free once they've
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:54.480]  taken over. He's there on the DMZ. If you're a TV viewer, he sent us photos of him there
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:58.840]  right on the edge of North Korea. And again, when he was in the State Department, he was
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:00.080]  actually over that area.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:03.560]  He knows all those people, that's why. He hinted when he was on a few weeks ago when
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:08.480]  this crisis was bubbling that he'd go there. And we got an email Friday morning, I'm here.
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:15.600]  I'm ready to report. And he's got a government-assigned person with him. Pretty amazing to have him
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:19.520]  actually up there reporting on what's happening. And he's done negotiations with these people
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:24.640]  before Kim Jong-un's dad, Kim Jong-il, so he can speak about it.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:29.360]  You can pull it up where he was arrested once by Assad's dad in Syria. I mean, pretty wild.
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:33.320]  We gotta get Pachinik on sometimes. In fact, the next interview about just all the wild
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.720]  stuff he's done, it's not classified. But I mean, instead of just reading it in the
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:42.640]  newspaper, manipulating the Red Brigades into killing the Italian Prime Minister who they
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:44.360]  already had kidnapped, is that true?
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:48.480]  Is that a lie? By the way, is that true when the London Telegraph says that, or is that
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:49.480]  a lie, Dr. Pachinik?
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:53.640]  What does the London Telegraph say? I don't read it. I won't read it, but let's get to
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:56.480]  the key mission. The London Telegraph's not relevant to anything.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:01.480]  No, I understand. So you're there, there's totally loading the missiles of warheads,
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:02.480]  threatening the nucas.
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:07.680]  Are they capable? Artemis is capable of hitting South Korea. Are they capable? Yes. Will they
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:12.800]  do it? No. The reason they cannot do it is because they don't want to destroy the very
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:17.760]  basis of which they're going to be the part of South Korea. In other words, the overall
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:23.640]  strategy for the United States, South Korea and North Korea and China is to have what
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:30.160]  we call a soft landing. For Kim Jong-un, who is not crazy, by the way, he's very predictable
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:37.240]  and he's very rational. He really has no desire to destroy anything, including the West Coast
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:43.440]  of America or South Korea. Number one, he has a deliverable system, which is not really
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:48.440]  very functionable. The missile systems are old, they're antiquated. The what we call
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:53.600]  the single strike kill probabilities are very low. Usually they're rated at 90%. In his
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:58.480]  case, they're rated at about 1%. And same with our missiles. Our missiles were always
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:03.960]  rated at 90% as single strike kill probability, but they never really got out of the silo.
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:08.120]  And when they did, they really fell on the ground. So the missile strikes itself are
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:13.200]  just using as a bargaining technique. I think Chuck Hagel, our Secretary of Defense, understand
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:18.520]  this very well. He has done an excellent job of saying I will not put missile systems on
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:22.720]  the West Coast because it will provoke them. I think Chuck, who has understood the Vietnam
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:28.600]  War and the necessity to manage pre-conflict and pre-wars has done an excellent job.
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:35.320]  Sure. I mean, modern cruise missiles are the threat, not antiquated 1960s ICBMs that even
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:38.920]  if you have rocket scientists working on them around the clock, it's very hard to get them
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:43.440]  out of the silos. These idiots can't even make a car. So it's a hoax to get food and
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:48.840]  to get oil. So if this is their biggest saber rattling ever, does this signify the North
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:53.040]  is preparing to collapse, which is a real danger? Well, it's a good point, Alice. It's
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:57.800]  not signifying that they're preparing to collapse. It's signifying that they're afraid of collapsing
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:04.800]  because of the UN embargo and the fact that we have effectively really tightened the amount
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:13.680]  of commodities and food that they have had. The real problem for North Korea is not America.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:17.960]  It's not South Korea. The real problem for North Korea is China.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:23.680]  North Koreans, 22 million will not come over the border of the DMZ. I can see them. They've
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:28.120]  been kept away by the North Korean soldiers. And basically what's happening, they will
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:35.140]  head west into China and storm over the borders of China. So it's China who's really manipulating
[01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:40.640]  a lot of the situation now in order to pay back the American troops and American foreign
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:45.640]  policy for what we're doing now with Japan, because we're aligning ourselves with old
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:52.200]  enemies. Japan was our old enemy. It's become a new friend. China was our old enemy, our
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:57.680]  old friend. And now it's become a new enemy. Korea, South Korea was really an old enemy
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:02.400]  because it was part of the Japanese empire. Most people don't realize how Korea was started.
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:07.720]  So why are they doing all this saber rattling? And why did you say, Friday, this could trigger
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:13.400]  a wider war in World War III? Well, because if you're not managed correctly, and fortunately
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:17.940]  we do have Hagel and we do have John Kerry, who's coming here and our embassy is keeping
[01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:22.800]  everything cool. But the real issue underneath all of this is having somebody like myself
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:27.360]  who I don't see, not because I'm so wonderful, but I've had 30 years experience working
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:33.120]  with the North and South Korean understanding of psychological manipulation and the manipulation
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:39.400]  of psyops. This is a complete psychological warfare. So when you hear things like that
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:44.160]  we don't understand the black box of North Korea, it's absolutely wrong. They are predictable.
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:49.720]  They're not crazy. They're rational. It's a communist Chinese puppet. It's a Chinese
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:55.240]  communist puppet state. Not really only Chinese communist puppet. Let me make it even clearer,
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:01.600]  Alex, to your audience. Kim Jong-un has spent 15 years in Switzerland. You and I have barely
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:07.120]  spent one day in Switzerland. He has been raised to be spoiled, entitled. He's very
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:12.120]  shy. He's very awkward. He was not very smart at school. I know the exact school he
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:15.500]  went to in Switzerland because I was there in boarding school, but unlike him, I was
[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:20.720]  kicked out after one week for being too American. But he is basically, we know everything about
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:26.240]  Kim Jong-un and we know everything about Kim Jong-il because they have a compound in Switzerland.
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:32.560]  So you have the very rich and the very spoiled who drive Maseratis, smoke Yves Saint Laurent
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:38.400]  and drink Johnny Walker, things that we don't do. And they're running a state called North
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:43.200]  Korea or communism. In my world, the only people who can be communists, who afford to
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:46.680]  be communists are multimillionaires. And that's the case with Kim Jong-un.
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:54.680]  I mean, it's total, total bizarro world, absurdism past the 10th power. So let me ask you this
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:59.040]  question. What do you expect to happen then? Because you were saying Friday it was bad
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:05.400]  management building up their power when Kim Jong-un or in can't even wipe his own butt.
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:10.040]  Well, what I'm expecting to happen is if he's totally out of control and he's controlled
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:15.320]  primarily by his uncle and his aunt. The aunt is the real, the sister of his father. She
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:18.800]  controls him. And then there's one other person, I don't want to get into the Korean name,
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:24.160]  who deals with the Chinese. The real issue here will be for John Kerry and for Chuck
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:29.800]  Hagel to get to Lee Pong of China and explain to them very quickly, if they don't cease
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:37.920]  and desist to provoke Kim Jong-un into this situation, serious problems will occur in
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:42.720]  China and in the sea of China. This has nothing to do really with Kim Jong-un. What you have
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:48.160]  to look at, what there is, is a distraction and deception that's purposely created by
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:52.680]  the Chinese against the United States. The ones who are really calling the shots are
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:58.680]  now the new leader, Lee Pong of China, who was a technocrat who also was spoiled.
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:03.360]  So China wants to make us take care of their problem, North Korea. The answer is laugh
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:08.280]  at them, make fun of Kim Jong-un and Dennis Rodman instead of acting like they can actually
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:09.280]  attack America.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:13.560]  Well, you can laugh at them. I wouldn't necessarily laugh at them. And he's a fat boy, you know,
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:17.760]  who's kind of shy. He's awkward. And normally in the high school in America, Kim Jong-un
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:21.680]  would be considered a geek and he would be bullied. You don't need to do that. You just
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:27.480]  ignore him. What you really do is strategically do what the sink pack our Navy has done, which
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:33.560]  is to cut off the straits of Malacca, get into the China Sea and make sure that there's
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:38.760]  no conflict between the Chinese, the Vietnamese and the Filipinos over the straits, over the
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:43.320]  China Sea oil. This is always about oil and economic opportunity.
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:48.080]  And that pirate-filled zone. When we come back, how do you expect this to end? How would
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:51.680]  you like it to end versus where you think it's going? You seem more happy since you
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:58.680]  were on Friday. When you are reporting and see between what we hear in the rhetoric that's
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:03.120]  absurd in the newspapers of America and what I see in South Korea, where they're far more
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.120]  constrained.
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:07.280]  All right. Well, let's break it down straight ahead. We're going to be right back in followers

[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:13.140]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights
[01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:18.260]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:23.760]  elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:28.760]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now, there are hundreds of great products

[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:47.920]  taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than thirty seven pounds
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:53.300]  in just two months. Now that's results. I want to challenge my listeners to go to info

[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:15.960]  huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:20.480]  us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:24.880]  in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight, out of mind. And so you don't think

[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:34.960]  in the United States captured by six foreign mega banks who are above the law and pay no
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:40.600]  taxes. They've signed me on and you and your entire family as well to their 1.5 quadrillion
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:46.280]  in derivatives. And they are openly trying to wreck the family, shut down competition,
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:51.760]  open the borders, take our guns and there's a new army report out, their new manual says
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:57.560]  Christians period are extremist terrorist, including they see Orthodox Jews are extremist
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:58.560]  terrorist.
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:04.120]  That's Fox News up at info wars.com and prison planet.com. And in the next segment, I wanna
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:08.000]  ask Dr. Pacinek his political views cuz he's a really interesting guy on all the things
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.840]  that are happening. I know he's worked under five different administrations. Of course,
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:15.960]  you can find out more about him who's co-written some of the books with Tom Clancy as the technical
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:18.680]  expert and as a composite character of the Jack Ryan.
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:23.240]  So kind of the Jack Ryan individual on this right now, Steve Pacinek. Dr. Steve Pacinek
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:28.720]  is a psychiatrist and a medical doctor and wrote the book on psychological warfare in
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:32.760]  the late 70s. It's still the Bible used in a lot of intelligence agencies today. He's
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:37.480]  very critical of all the deception that goes on right now today and the authoritarianism.
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:41.640]  Okay, so talk to me like I'm five years old. Friday you're saying there is a danger of
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:45.760]  war, only because it's being overhyped and giving North Korea the idea of power which
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:51.280]  may make Kim Jong-un toddling around like a bizarrest joke.
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:55.740]  Actually feel like he has power. The communist Chinese are now freaking out saying don't
[01:34:55.740 --> 01:35:00.380]  cause problems, North Korea, which is out of capitulation. Geopolitically, you call
[01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:07.160]  it a psyop, break down the different angles, Dr. Pacinek. And then I wanna ask you a big
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:12.040]  question. I'm gonna ask you a big question. And of course, that question is, is there
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:13.480]  a way to fix North Korea?
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:17.680]  Will it ever unify or is it too bizarre? I mean, this guy's saying I'll nuke you, I'll
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:23.560]  kill you, even if he doesn't have the capacity. They've got D.U. Shabo meteor guns in space.
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:27.280]  What would happen if he was taken out? Because when somebody says I have nukes, I'm loading,
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:31.120]  I will kill you. If somebody came to my house with a gun, whether it's loaded or unloaded,
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:34.240]  and said, I'm gonna kill you, I'm not gonna wait and see if it's loaded.
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:38.960]  I believe, and I don't even support war, people know that. I believe the guy should be taken
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:42.920]  out, but I don't want him to be taken out. I'm saying we have a right to take him out.
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:43.920]  Go ahead.
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:47.840]  Here's the worst case scenario. The worst case scenario is what happened underneath
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:56.360]  his father, Kim Jong Il, and his grandfather, Kim Il Sung. Kim Il Sung went overboard where
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:04.000]  he blew up an entire dais where there was South Korean officials, including major senior
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.560]  officials, and he overreacted. But we were able to work that backwards. Under Kim Jong
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:16.040]  Il, Kim Jong Il, his father, he had blown up ships and he had blown up an island where
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:20.840]  they use it as a kind of pro forma to show the world that they're quite serious.
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:23.920]  And hijacked and hijacked ships like the Pueblo.
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:31.760]  Correct. And also shoot down the Korean airline. Now, what happens in a game like this in psychological
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:37.240]  warfare, and, you know, we can't control all the variables, but you have to be able
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:42.540]  to estimate most of the variables is that they literally do overreact. And the overreaction
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:48.960]  in this case would be where, in fact, a missile strike could accidentally get into one of
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:54.840]  the areas that they had not intended, where, in fact, one of the commanders underneath
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:37:01.880]  Kim Il Sung could literally decide to defect and become a renegade and try to approach
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:06.360]  the DMZ, although that's not likely because it's highly mined and we have a lot of forces
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:12.200]  ready to go. In fact, in the old days we had to hold back the Republic of Korean Army with
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:20.400]  PLO, with oil lubrication and petroleum. But the reality is that at this particular point
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:27.720]  in time, if there isn't that extreme exercise, and if we can't decrease the rhetoric from
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:31.920]  our news media, which is the worst part of it because the South Korean people have been
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:37.400]  complaining to me everywhere, that particularly CNN and a lot of our media are hyping up this
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:43.120]  notion of missiles and missile strikes. They find it very disgusting and very insulting
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:47.360]  because most South Koreans here that I'm working with and talking to, even on the DMZ
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:52.000]  zone, are very calm, even though they're cautious. They're calm, they relax, they
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:56.880]  go through an everyday activity, they do what they have to do, they live their life normally,
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:02.280]  but they resent this overlay of warmongering that's being created by our military industrial
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:08.280]  complex and our communication system. Let me give you an example. They know very well
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:14.400]  that within days of the time that we had a crisis starting, guess who came in to sell
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:21.920]  airplanes? European Airlines, the one that makes Airbus, came in with a $7.7 billion
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:28.120]  contract. In turn, Lockheed Martin came in for an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter for $7.7
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:38.040]  billion. Boeing came in for the F-15 Silent Eagle contract. And then another one, McDonnell
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:43.160]  Douglas and other companies, Lockheed Martin, came in with an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter,
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:49.240]  all trying to sell to the Korean Army fighter jets that they don't need. Right now, they
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:58.280]  don't need it. Right now, Hyundai, Samsung, LG, and SK, these major Zaibatsus are doing
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:03.480]  extremely well, and they resent the fact that the United States military industrial complex
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:09.040]  and the communication systems that are run by the Northeast, the Midwest, and by the
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:15.160]  military industrial system, is imposing on them military requirements that they don't
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:21.520]  need and want. They want to create a society which can expand. In that process, if in fact
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:26.280]  we alienate the South Koreans, who are now being run by a very effective president named
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:33.640]  Ms. Parts, who is the first woman president of South Korea, whose father I knew because
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:38.560]  he was assassinated right after the time I was here. I was not involved in the assassination.
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:43.800]  General Parks is very well aware of what it means to have assassination and killing. She's
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:48.920]  not interested in the assassination of Kim Jong-un. That will not accomplish anything.
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:54.280]  You cannot assassinate leaders at this particular point in time when in fact they're being managed
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:58.520]  by the Chinese and other companies. Sure, they'll put another titular figurehead
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:04.340]  scumball in. Well, he's a titular head. He's a kid who's
[01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:10.720]  absolutely spoiled, who's spent time in Switzerland. But the real strategic issue now is who is
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:16.640]  going to control the oil and the military industrial requirements of the South China
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:20.720]  Sea, including Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Japan.
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:27.840]  Sure, so it's being used as a kamikaze or as a set piece, a proxy state to do this.
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:31.360]  Dr. Pritchett, you're a really smart guy, so I'm asking a real opinion on this. Where
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:36.000]  do you expect this to go? I mean, will I be a grandpa and there's the fifth hereditary
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:41.040]  dictator of North Korea, and instead of 30 million people like 50 years ago, there are
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:46.360]  23 million, and there's 1 million of them? No, I expect that within the period of time
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:51.000]  that I've been here since I was involved in the transition from Jeon Doo-nung, No 2-1,
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.280]  to from military dictatorship in South Korea to civilian, you have to remember there was
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:58.880]  a military dictatorship. Carter and Reagan sent me here, and I made
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:04.160]  that transition to civilian. Within 20 years, this country has expanded so quickly that
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:06.400]  it makes our country look pathetic. It's clean.
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:09.520]  And by the way, you're not bragging. Every time you say this stuff, I go and look it
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:13.640]  up and find where you were involved in the negotiating team to get rid of the military
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:18.320]  dictatorship that I was already aware of the history of, because I'm obsessed with history.
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:23.680]  And you were a key guy, suggesting the psychological stuff. I was watching a documentary, and it
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:28.200]  said the psychological team of the State Department recommended that they still give it one more
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:32.440]  day. And then, in the Camp David peace deal that happened, and that was you.
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:36.400]  So you really have been there at so many key historical points. What scares me is what
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:41.720]  you said Friday. You offered your help a week ago, before this even was really going, or
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:46.520]  a week and a half ago. They didn't want your help now. Every other administration has.
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:49.160]  What does that say? Are they smoking their own dope, drinking their own Kool-Aid?
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:54.040]  No, what it says is basically, thanks to you and me and the fact that the American public
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:42:00.040]  has supported us, the day I said that 9-11 was a stand-down, the day I said that Bush
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:06.200]  Jr. was a criminal, that Cheney was a criminal, that our war in Iraq was a disaster, and that
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:11.200]  the generals involved were criminals, the day I said that Obama came in and lied about
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:16.760]  Osama bin Laden, he lied about Benghazi, he lied about Sandy Hook, that made me persona
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:22.600]  non grata in my own country. I have a better access to get into North Korea and the DMZ
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:28.280]  zone in South Korea and even China, my ostensible enemies that I have in my own country. My
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:34.520]  own military intelligence said to me, good luck and goodbye. I got into the KCIA, U.S.
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:42.160]  Embassy, which normally affords a deputy assistant secretary a normal, you know, professional
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:47.080]  recognition from the past. There's no recognition. So basically, I'm persona non grata.
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:50.360]  Sure, they're scared of you. They're scared of you. I mean, in the land of the blind.
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:53.000]  They're scared of me. I don't particularly care. It's not about me.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.360]  No, I understand. It's about not having World War III. We got to go to break. But in the
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:43:00.240]  land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. Steve Pacinek, Dr. Pacinek is our guest. I'm

[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:16.120]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:32.840]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:37.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm having conversations with Dr. Steve Pechenik during the break and
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:42.240]  forgetting that we're live back on air. We only ran 30 seconds of intro music, right?
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:46.080]  Okay, it's good. I didn't know, I'm like, whoa. I'm like, I've been talking a while
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:50.680]  here. We're having some interesting discussions there off air. Bottom line, why did you go
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:56.720]  to Korea? Where do you think it's going, Dr. Pechenik? One of the most famous hostage negotiators,
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:01.080]  crisis negotiators out there helped get the media's peace deals going.
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:05.480]  What do you expect to happen? What do you expect to see happen with the missiles being
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:11.000]  loaded they claim? Or is that just more of a push by North Korea to get more oil and
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.440]  food? And if they're this desperate now, when they do fall apart, what do you expect to
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:17.440]  happen?
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:22.160]  You said implode into China, implode into South Korea. Is there any way to ever fix
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:27.280]  North Korea and get aid to those people under the cult of the state?
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:33.000]  Yes, let me start with the first question. Number one, the day I finished my interview
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.400]  with you, which was so grateful that on Sandy Hook where I told you it was a false flag.
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:43.920]  I knew that Obama and his White House choir boys would start another false flag in Korea.
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:47.680]  I could see it. I could smell it. So I got on the plane the next day without anybody's
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:52.920]  permission. I was told not to go. I came here and I wanted to report directly to you and
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:57.240]  the American public, went on to the DMZ zone and other parts of North Korea, which I cannot
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:04.960]  describe because of the past experience. And I knew that there would be an escalation of
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:11.240]  rhetoric and an escalation of behavior, which I wanted to see and monitor directly to the
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:15.520]  American public, particularly the Alex Jones show, because I couldn't trust the media.
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:19.440]  I couldn't trust our CIA. I couldn't trust our military intelligence. I couldn't trust
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:23.900]  our government. It's as simple as that. And what I saw happening was that there was
[01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:28.480]  a total disconnect between what was being said and what the reality was on the ground
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:33.080]  here at the DMZ zone, where I saw some movements, but very little movements on the part of the
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:38.360]  North Koreans. I had a lot of rain, a lot of cold weather, and I saw a lot of the rock
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:40.800]  or Republic of Korean Army soldiers.
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:44.760]  So that's good news. There's not a real mobilization to invade the South.
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:49.120]  No, there is no mobilization to invade the South. And furthermore, from past history,
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:54.460]  I know very well, as well as our military commanders do, that the 2.2 million men that
[01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:59.320]  are officially in the Korean Army, North Korean Army are totally useless. They're hungry.
[01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:03.920]  They have no equipment. All the equipment is antiquated. The ammunition is antiquated.
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:08.080]  And they have no desire or capability to really invade through the southern section.
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:13.420]  Number two, the key issue here is not the invasion. It's really the fact that psychologically
[01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:19.480]  they want to create a scenario, a psychodrama, where we come back to the table, we, the United
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:24.480]  States of America, come back to the table and offer them food assistance so that they
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:29.780]  can have a soft landing, or what we call the Sunshine Policy, over 30 years. Now, what
[01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:34.360]  is a soft landing? A soft landing means that we know from past experience, particularly
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:40.080]  in the Bush administration, which, again, I was involved with, when we amalgamated or
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:46.200]  joined East Germany and West Germany, we made a mistake in 1991 by not figuring out that
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:52.000]  East Germany had so much economic burden to it that West Germany could not absorb it.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.880]  And in turn, we translated that problem to South Korea and North Korea. There is no way
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:01.400]  that South Korea can absorb North Korean problems and economic disruption.
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:04.240]  So how does it end, then? How do you see it ending? Is there any good ending?
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:08.960]  I see it positively ending if we get out of the way. If we stop this agitation and we
[01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:14.720]  stop these false flag operations, we stop this incredible amount of military industrial
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:15.720]  production.
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:19.680]  So bottom line, the military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about wants to keep
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:25.640]  it going, to sell more weapons, but all the money is worthless if we start World War III
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:26.640]  with the Chi-Cons.
[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:32.760]  Exactly. But ironically, Alex, your audience has to understand, we lost every war since
[01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:37.440]  World War II. We lost the Korean War and it was Eisenhower, our general, one of the greatest
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:41.960]  presidents I've ever seen, who had to come in and draw the line on the DMZ. Nobody talks
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:47.120]  about the fact that it was a great military general who had to create the peace and say,
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:51.880]  that's enough. We don't have that. We have a president who's not qualified, not competent-
[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:54.320]  Instead, they just keep the wars going.
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:55.320]  Who's not qualified.
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:58.520]  Listen, I don't want to have war with North Korea either. And I know the globalists are
[01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:03.360]  corrupt and there's all these influences, but we invade Iraq. We ship Al Qaeda to Pakistan.
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:08.180]  Our government's using Al Qaeda and Libya and Syria. It's incredible crimes going on.
[01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:13.800]  And then still, the North Korean clear death spots go on forever. I mean, the good die
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:19.240]  young, the evil states never seem to die either. I mean, I am just ready to see Kim Jong-un
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:24.480]  hanging like Mussolini being spit on. I want to free those people, but I get it's a set
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:28.440]  piece. How could they ever transition into a peace with the South?
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:32.360]  Because we're doing it very slowly. The South Koreans have been very effectively creating
[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:34.760]  like a military industrial complex-
[01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:37.160]  Economic zone, sure, sure.
[01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:44.280]  K-E-O-S-O-N-G, where 54,000 North Koreans are already working, making over $700 million
[01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:49.960]  to the economy. And the North Koreans know this. But instead, what they want to do is
[01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:55.760]  to reaffirm the position of this little chubby fat boy from Switzerland who hasn't done anything
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:01.360]  and try to show that he's in charge. In fact, only three people in charge, his uncle, his
[01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:07.040]  aunt, and a third person who deals with China. And the real puppeteer here is China. And
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:12.080]  if China is not warned to cease and desist, they will have problems internally. And I
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:16.040]  can help them to have problems internally because number one, they have social disturbances
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:23.920]  of about 150,000 riots on a normal year in China. They have water deprecation-
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:27.760]  By the way, I agree with you. People keep saying China's gonna take over. The CFR says
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:30.280]  that. China is on the verge of imploding.
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:37.200]  China is in such a bad state, it's worse than North Korea. Because at least North Korea,
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:42.840]  we can stabilize. China, we can't. China has now economically defaulted on loans. They've
[01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:44.360]  given out loans that they can't-
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:49.320]  Sure, so let me stop you. Here's my bottom line. You're a smart guy, historian, psychiatrist,
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:53.520]  medical doctor, seen a lot, run black ops all over the world, brought down regimes with
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:54:00.440]  psych warfare. What do you expect to see with the basket case China and the basket case
[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:05.400]  North Korea and the West as a basket case with delusional decadence?
[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:07.040]  What do you expect to see?
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:11.880]  I expect to see that we get a new government in the United States. That's the number one
[01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:16.800]  issue. We cannot have another Hillary Clinton, another Clinton who lies, another Democrat
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:22.560]  or Republican. We have to reconstruct the Constitution, re-employ new leaders of our
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:26.760]  country that come from the grassroots up, particularly governors who've been very effective
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:31.600]  in running executive positions. We have to decrease our government size. It is out of
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:36.680]  control. We have to close down the CIA 9000, close down Homeland Security, close down all
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:42.360]  these unnecessary, worthless organizations that do nothing to either increase our national
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:47.720]  security or increase our productivity. We will have to increase our manufacturing capacity
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:54.200]  and decrease the size of our banks and their corruption. In the meantime, in China, they
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:58.200]  have a major problem. If I wanted to create the destruction of China, it's far easier
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:06.800]  for me as a psychological warfare expert than to maintain, than to destroy North Korea.
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:11.360]  All I have to do is create a war between India and China, which is what's happening now,
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:17.520]  and arm India, arm China and allow them to fight over water. So I'm not as worried about
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:23.280]  North Korea. North Korea will be quietly brought down. Hagel has done a very good job of doing
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:28.240]  that. Kerry's coming over here and maintaining the quietness. The problem we have in America,
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:32.560]  and that's the greatest problem we have, is our national leaders since Clinton, who was
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:38.600]  a pathological liar and created a lot of wars and created rendition, then followed by Bush
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:44.480]  Jr., the moron of morons who should have been indicted for war crimes, went to Iraq, Afghanistan,
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:50.960]  and then Obama, who's totally a CIA-bred and born operative who knows absolutely nothing
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:55.720]  about world affairs or running domestic affairs. He's talking about abortion. He's talking
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:56:00.920]  about Obamacare. He's talking about gun control. When we have to worry about national, we have
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:03.760]  to worry about our economy and jobs and jobs.
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:11.060]  Exactly. As a Ford Foundation, as a Ford Foundation infiltrator of the national security complex,
[01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:15.560]  he just wants to conquer America. And instead, even if they want an empire, they're gonna
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:20.540]  lose the empire if they don't save the original republic. You can clearly see the writing
[01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:25.400]  on the wall. No amount of bullets and armored vehicles is gonna save them from the collapse
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:27.160]  of the American system.
[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:31.880]  And if they don't get off the back of liberty, they're gonna make our engine stall and the
[01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:33.520]  whole plane's gonna crash.
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:39.240]  Well, I'm gonna have a much more predictive element to that. I wrote about 20 years ago
[01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:46.200]  that, in fact, if the federal government continues to expand in size and its powers and its internal
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:51.760]  suppression of our systems, we will have potentially a second civil war between the states that,
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:57:00.560]  in fact, have the resources like Texas, Florida, Utah, the Midwest versus the eastern states.
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:05.120]  Right now, the Council on Foreign Relations, all the eastern think tanks like Brookings,
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:11.240]  SIP, Rand are useless. And they're being funded by all of us to create policies that have
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:14.160]  absolutely no meaning. The West Coast is totally meaningless.
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:18.400]  I tell you what, doctor, doctor, I want you to get some sleep. We're back on the radio
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:21.200]  tomorrow. How long are you in Korea?
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:24.560]  I will be here a few more days to serve you and our American public.
[01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:28.920]  All right, well, let's get you set up. We're gonna get you set up for a report tomorrow,
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:32.280]  sometime during the three hour show. Chris, pick 30 minutes to do it. All right, thank
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:33.280]  you so much, Dr. Pacinek.
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:37.480]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you, America. But I want everybody to understand Alex is not
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:42.000]  a conspiratorial individual. I don't think there's anybody in the mass media who really
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  understands Plato and Zarathustra as well as Alex does.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:53.480]  All right, we're not gonna have the Gutter Dommeron quite yet, my friend. I hope not.
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:58:10.440]  The Ragnar Rook. All right, retransmission starts now in fallwars.com. See you back tomorrow.
