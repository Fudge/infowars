[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:35.000]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen it is Monday
[00:35.000 --> 00:43.480]  October 8 2012 I'm Alex Jones your host thank you so much for joining us here today we'll be
[00:43.480 --> 00:49.480]  here for the next three hours and wow is there a lot of news and information to cover we are
[00:49.480 --> 00:55.560]  going to open the phones up throughout the three hours today and when we come back in the next
[00:55.560 --> 01:00.440]  break I'm going to give the phone number out for first-time callers in the first hour into the
[01:00.440 --> 01:06.440]  second hour then we'll have a total free-for-all after that I'll do my best job racing to your
[01:06.440 --> 01:13.960]  calls and going through them as quickly as I can where to begin you know former secretary of
[01:13.960 --> 01:19.200]  defense Gates was quoted last week CBS News saying a military strike against Iran would be
[01:19.200 --> 01:27.160]  catastrophic the current head of the CIA Panetta warrants conflict between Syria and Turkey may
[01:27.160 --> 01:34.400]  produce regional war or Defense Secretary Leon Panetta always get that mixed up with CIA pretty
[01:34.400 --> 01:39.880]  much the same thing said on Saturday that the conflict on the border between Syria and Turkey
[01:39.880 --> 01:49.040]  may spread to the neighboring countries and create a regional war so there you have it meanwhile a
[01:49.040 --> 01:55.760]  think tank path to Iran nuke warhead two to four months that's the Associated Press so the hype is
[01:55.760 --> 02:03.560]  out there you've got think tanks on C-span you know the newton the nearest group center and others
[02:03.560 --> 02:10.240]  openly saying we need a false flag to go into Iran in fact cue that up guys I know I said Friday
[02:10.240 --> 02:14.080]  queue it up never went to it but I'm going to go to that coming up the next segment because
[02:14.080 --> 02:22.760]  it's so important all of this all of this is unfolding before our very eyes and Obama NATO
[02:22.760 --> 02:29.200]  the globalist with Turkey have been inserting tens of thousands of al-Qaeda and other jihadis into
[02:29.200 --> 02:37.280]  Syria to engage in just incredibly immoral preemptive invasion proxy war and now the UN and
[02:37.280 --> 02:42.480]  NATO have had to admit and Turkey said to admit okay we don't have proof that Syria fired some
[02:42.480 --> 02:48.960]  murders and we did basically make it up that they had apologized for it so there's your false flag
[02:48.960 --> 03:00.440]  right there and even Panetta is saying again as I just read that this could lead to a much much
[03:00.440 --> 03:10.560]  wider war that could lead to a new world war but this is a war going on a large war going on
[03:10.560 --> 03:17.600]  and it ties into the world economic meltdown that's happening it ties into the martial law
[03:17.600 --> 03:23.440]  preparations troops more and more on the streets running crowd control in the United States just
[03:23.440 --> 03:30.120]  a phase into martial law unannounced martial law all of this is happening and they're trying to
[03:30.120 --> 03:35.200]  bring back the model states health emergency powers act for forced inoculations I'm going to get
[03:35.200 --> 03:40.880]  back into that news that I covered some of yesterday but a lot more is out on that now and then
[03:40.880 --> 03:47.080]  of course TSA and the police are rolling out at checkpoints body scanners that quote know
[03:47.080 --> 03:51.760]  everything about your body drudge report.com link to our story on Friday throughout the weekend
[03:51.760 --> 03:58.480]  by Lisa Garber up at info wars.com but I want to go over some of this because these are just
[03:58.480 --> 04:02.960]  quack machines just like they hook you up to a lie detector and say oh it says you're a terrorist
[04:02.960 --> 04:07.560]  and it turns out it's a fraud or crime labs have been caught framing people in every major city
[04:07.560 --> 04:12.880]  that you can imagine Dallas Houston just where I live in Texas and New York the FBI crime labs
[04:12.880 --> 04:18.560]  famous the San Francisco crime lab industrial scale frame-ups well now they just have a computer
[04:20.400 --> 04:26.000]  well it says you have explosives it says you smoke marijuana it says you're a drug addict goodbye no
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.000]  judge no jury the computer says so it's just a complete overthrow of our liberty and freedom
[04:32.640 --> 04:39.200]  that's all coming up Romney's vowing to arm Al Qaeda terrorists in Syria so him and Obama are
[04:39.200 --> 04:45.760]  battling out to see who can be the most warmongering this is completely immoral on its face but

[12:29.440 --> 12:35.360]  erected here in the united states that's why so many extremely wealthy people including

[12:42.720 --> 12:50.720]  saying you've got to get out by 2012 then the rules change so it's all happening right now a global
[12:50.720 --> 13:00.720]  corporate tyranny is coming in and shutting down freedom and it's in all the financial publications
[13:00.720 --> 13:06.880]  it's all being announced meanwhile though the average police officer is being given manuals
[13:06.880 --> 13:10.240]  saying if somebody talks about global corporate government they're a terrorist that wants to
[13:10.240 --> 13:15.920]  kill you this doesn't exist and the average cop is just like the general public dumbered in a box
[13:15.920 --> 13:24.640]  of rocks dumbed down and i've got articles here today in my stack where people that play terrorist
[13:24.640 --> 13:31.920]  in tv shows are being attacked are being confronted because the public doesn't know the difference
[13:31.920 --> 13:37.200]  and and studies have shown that uh that when people watch shows like 24 that of course that
[13:37.200 --> 13:41.840]  shows no longer on well they don't have new episodes but it's in syndication or when they
[13:41.840 --> 13:48.480]  watch all the dozens of other shows every cop show every military show out there you torture
[13:48.480 --> 13:53.760]  people good guys torture good guys break rules good guys kill innocent people good guys torture
[13:53.760 --> 13:58.880]  children and people are watching this fantasizing in fact here's that article then i'll get into the
[13:58.880 --> 14:04.480]  other news damien louis feared he was going to get his head pulverized after he was confronted
[14:04.480 --> 14:12.880]  over his terrorist role in homeland these are the type of shows they have and they have shows now
[14:12.880 --> 14:23.600]  where uh where where it's it's based in texas uh and you're a terrorist basically of your pro gun
[14:23.600 --> 14:28.080]  homeland star damien louis has revealed how he feared he was going to get beaten up for playing
[14:28.080 --> 14:32.960]  a terrorist the emi winning actor said he was confronted by an angry american while filming
[14:32.960 --> 14:39.520]  the series where he plays a marine who's been turned by a terrorist group he said his portrayal
[14:39.520 --> 14:45.600]  the traitor was so convincing that people actually believed he was real and again who are the terrorist
[14:46.400 --> 14:56.800]  in homeland the confrontation came as he filmed homeland in charlotte north carolina
[14:56.800 --> 15:04.080]  he told noxville.com there was a slightly hairy moment down in charlotte there was a barbecue
[15:04.080 --> 15:10.000]  going on and there was a bunch of southern boys they're drinking beer eating fried chicken eating
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.120]  steak one of them comes up to me and says so you're playing a terrorist and nervous louis said yes i
[15:15.120 --> 15:22.640]  actually don't know yet he looked me in the eye slightly drunk blurry eyed i thought i was about
[15:22.640 --> 15:29.760]  to get my head pulverized i'm going to bleep off a lot of people and then he goes in to basically the
[15:29.760 --> 15:38.400]  guy threatening him louis joked that when he first met obama he asked him if he could let him know
[15:38.400 --> 15:44.160]  when the u.s planned to attack iran so he could use it in his second series of homeland and these
[15:44.160 --> 15:49.360]  are all these shows coming out they've got a new one on mbc called founding fathers coming out
[15:49.360 --> 15:54.240]  where an army commando infiltrates a group of right-wingers who don't want to turn their guns
[15:54.240 --> 15:59.920]  into terrorists and the cops are all watching this thinking that if you actually are a real
[15:59.920 --> 16:05.200]  american and and and understand what's happening you're a terrorist and then they fantasize it all
[16:05.200 --> 16:13.520]  blurs together what hasl hoff has talked about people constantly coming up to him thinking
[16:13.520 --> 16:21.840]  baywatch was real and that he was really a that he was really a lifeguard there you know the actors
[16:21.840 --> 16:27.600]  involved in fantasy island talked about how constantly they were being approached about
[16:27.600 --> 16:34.000]  where is fantasy island we want to go there i read articles about people thought gilligan's
[16:34.000 --> 16:40.160]  island was real and being filmed there you see the general public if this is the key to everything
[16:40.160 --> 16:45.360]  is in a suspended disbelief that's when you go to a movie and within minutes the average person
[16:45.360 --> 16:52.480]  clicks off and just accepts it is real that's why movies and things really aren't entertaining
[16:52.480 --> 16:57.440]  to me anymore because i don't ever really suspend my disbelief i'm sitting there thinking about the
[16:57.440 --> 17:04.160]  lighting and the and the wardrobe and the acting and a couple weeks ago billy corrigan smashing
[17:04.160 --> 17:10.480]  pumpkin's founder was here in austin we went out to dinner and we went to a steakhouse and they
[17:10.480 --> 17:16.960]  played pretty good jazz in there i mean i like it and it was eddie vish and i said hey uh you want
[17:16.960 --> 17:22.000]  to go listen uh you know in the lounge or you want to go eat in here in the main diner and he goes no
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.440]  no the lounge he goes it sounds good but i'll be at work the whole time thinking about what they're
[17:27.440 --> 17:31.280]  doing and what they're playing i want to be as far away from the music as possible because he had to
[17:31.280 --> 17:36.640]  play at stubs the next night and it's the same thing i'm sitting there watching this i mean
[17:36.640 --> 17:43.120]  it's in the news that all these shows are paid by homeland security billions of dollars a year
[17:43.120 --> 17:47.360]  total i mean you saw in the news two weeks ago where hundreds of millions is being spent
[17:47.360 --> 17:53.920]  of of the huge some years ten million dollar budget of government to pay to have propaganda
[17:53.920 --> 18:02.320]  placement what they call behavior placement into the shows promoting obama care i mean
[18:02.320 --> 18:09.280]  we're not in kansas anymore that's not what a free country does this really got big under clinton
[18:10.720 --> 18:16.160]  bush expanded it and now obama has exploded it in fact the last number i saw well congress
[18:16.160 --> 18:20.800]  ruled and said it's illegal the congressional budget office the general accounting office
[18:20.800 --> 18:25.440]  they all looked at it and said this has got to stop and last time i checked it was 10 million a year
[18:26.320 --> 18:32.880]  and there it is homeland security films are a big hit but costly uh and again that's the austin
[18:32.880 --> 18:36.720]  chronicle they well that's the houston chronicle they pulled up i don't know if that's the particular
[18:36.720 --> 18:43.360]  article pertaining to that but you can type in obama obama care to be promoted in in in in tv
[18:43.360 --> 18:48.720]  shows and um that'll pull that up for people the point is that's like north korea that's
[18:48.720 --> 18:55.200]  like nazi germany when the state is there with messages and the public literally goes and accepts
[18:55.200 --> 19:03.360]  it all like it's real and so that's why we're in this position as a society that's why when a cop
[19:03.360 --> 19:08.480]  pulls you over and you've got a ron paul sticker or get us out of the u n sticker their training
[19:08.480 --> 19:18.640]  manuals are backed up by countless cop shows where murderers killers uh child killers uh child

[24:48.800 --> 24:56.960]  reduced down to nothing and i know i am right about my overall analysis and breakdown of the
[24:56.960 --> 25:03.920]  globalist do i occasionally make mistakes sure yesterday i was talking about an article
[25:05.280 --> 25:10.480]  with a bill in the house of representatives in the article was written by paul watson i
[25:10.480 --> 25:15.360]  misread it that it passed the house it's in committee dealing with preparations for mass
[25:15.360 --> 25:20.480]  casualties but the point is the article was about the preparations for mass casualties by
[25:20.480 --> 25:25.440]  fema confirming what erin dykes and i and others broke and info wars dot com three and
[25:25.440 --> 25:31.360]  a half years ago but i will make that correction here it's not past the house or panetta was the
[25:31.360 --> 25:38.080]  head of the cia now secretary defense so earlier i called him head of the cia not secretary defense
[25:38.080 --> 25:43.200]  little things like that but the overall general points we make are incontrovertible

[25:52.080 --> 26:01.600]  and videos of tsa grabbing people's genitals men's testicles and crushing them as punishment
[26:02.160 --> 26:06.800]  congressman out of san antonio just a few months ago talked about that brush the guy's hand away
[26:06.800 --> 26:11.280]  as he crushed him and they said hey we're going to charge you with assault for not letting us assault
[26:11.280 --> 26:17.840]  you tsa agents have pled guilty and admitted they rob people that don't let them grub them or complain
[26:19.440 --> 26:30.720]  and uh now the new article uh is out at info wars dot com tsa workers smacked me in my testicles
[26:30.720 --> 26:36.480]  for refusing body scan federal screeners now crushing genitals as form of punishment well
[26:36.480 --> 26:45.120]  yeah who else wants this type of job we're in a very very dark time and people who look back on
[26:45.120 --> 26:49.680]  history you know they say how did the germans do it how did the russians do it how did the romans
[26:49.680 --> 26:54.720]  put up with it how did the babelonians put up with it how did the ancient chinese put up with it
[26:56.160 --> 26:59.520]  well most of the time it was fashion they said it's fashionable
[26:59.520 --> 27:08.480]  to sacrifice your one-year-old child on an altar most cultures said well well the druids the europeans
[27:08.480 --> 27:14.080]  they thought it was cool to cut their children up in pieces and eat them uh the astex and the
[27:14.080 --> 27:21.120]  mayans thought it was cool to cut their kids up and eat them again because it was the fashion it
[27:21.120 --> 27:27.840]  was the religion it was the style uh japanese uh wealthy women chinese wealthy women would have
[27:27.840 --> 27:32.000]  their feet bound where they couldn't even walk because when you're really rich you can't walk
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.680]  you have to be carried around that was actually the servant caste manipulating with propaganda
[27:38.320 --> 27:45.760]  the rulers into becoming prisoners and that's how we're going into bondage is fads and styles
[27:45.760 --> 27:50.000]  it's very stylish to get into being scared of al qaeda who the government publicly runs
[27:50.000 --> 27:57.200]  it's very stylish to get into having no rights and being jellyfish like men are now taught the more
[27:57.920 --> 28:04.560]  not even effeminate but the more weak they are the more passe the more passive the more pathetic
[28:04.560 --> 28:12.160]  they are the cooler they are tsa workers smacked me in my testicles for refusing body scan federal
[28:12.160 --> 28:17.040]  screeners now crushing genitals as form of punishment yeah it's torture and then watson has
[28:17.040 --> 28:25.600]  all these links to mainstream news not just this latest case where people complain so they crush
[28:25.600 --> 28:32.320]  their genitals illustrating once again how the tsa is handing out arbitrary punishments for people
[28:32.320 --> 28:38.240]  who exercise their right to opt out of radiation firing body scanners frequent flyer steven defrost
[28:38.240 --> 28:43.680]  described how he had his testicles smacked by a tsa screener for refusing to go through the scanner
[28:43.680 --> 28:48.320]  i'll travel if you lost vegas oh yeah i've been through there defrost chose to opt out of the
[28:48.320 --> 28:53.680]  naked body scanner and was told to wait in a glass holding box a bulky young tsa agent came over
[28:53.680 --> 28:59.920]  to pat me down defrost told author christopher elliot he told me to turn around he was using his
[29:00.560 --> 29:05.920]  command voice barking orders i told him that i wasn't comfortable turning away from my luggage
[29:05.920 --> 29:10.320]  well yeah because tsa is known to rob you which has already been screened and wanted to keep
[29:10.320 --> 29:17.520]  it in sight the agent issued more order stay here i didn't tell you to move and empty your pockets
[29:17.520 --> 29:23.520]  and defrost defrost says the federal screener seemed irritated that he didn't obey without
[29:23.520 --> 29:30.320]  hesitation and that's when defrost says he was punished the agent knelt in front of him to conduct
[29:30.320 --> 29:36.000]  the bat the pat down as he raised his hands he was looking at me he says then he gave me a quick
[29:36.000 --> 29:41.120]  flick and smacked me in one of my testicles well that's what you get i mean that's a freedom
[29:41.120 --> 29:46.720]  in fact the new american flag should be testicles with a hand or smashing them flat i mean that is

[38:05.120 --> 38:12.000]  the through the temple into the brain and just start stabbing the brain uh of uh local uh
[38:12.640 --> 38:17.520]  generally uh down syndrome children and others who'd grown up and were a little
[38:17.520 --> 38:23.440]  boisterous and couldn't be controlled they just ice pick them guys type in uh psychiatrists performing
[38:23.440 --> 38:30.880]  public um lobotomy and and and and there'll be photos of uh psychiatry students around it being
[38:30.880 --> 38:36.080]  done but also traveling buses into the forties doing it i mean again it's just the hell level
[38:36.080 --> 38:42.720]  of all this the hell force and people will just not believe it's happening you're going to see
[38:42.720 --> 38:49.040]  people get more and more angry at us folks more and more upset as millions wake up every week
[38:49.040 --> 38:57.040]  and as the show explodes and as it goes into overdrive and as i face whatever fate i face is
[38:57.040 --> 39:02.320]  my punishment from the globalist doesn't matter it's absolute destiny that i do this you're going
[39:02.320 --> 39:07.520]  to see those that wake up and become enlightened and absolutely tear away the transfer in and just
[39:07.520 --> 39:13.600]  see the nightmare we're in and you're going to have those that become absolutely angry even
[39:13.600 --> 39:19.280]  those that we've thought have been awake friends and family you know as as the horror of reality
[39:19.280 --> 39:25.440]  gets so real and in their face they are going to embrace the darkness instead of the light
[39:25.440 --> 39:31.120]  and it's just it's just we're going to see insane times our children turned over to psychiatry
[39:31.840 --> 39:36.880]  uh checkpoints on the highways run by regular army and marines now in the news everywhere
[39:37.520 --> 39:42.800]  no longer are they drills told you that was coming uh you're going to see just the breakdown
[39:42.800 --> 39:48.720]  of society and the family uh you're going to see major cities that uh that where the police pull back
[39:49.280 --> 39:54.800]  and don't even provide uh you're going to see it in oakland they've already announced 35 crimes
[39:54.800 --> 39:59.520]  including felonies armed robbery that they won't respond to they've now put up public notices in
[39:59.520 --> 40:04.720]  detroit not to enter it and if you do it your own risk the police will now only do revenue generation
[40:04.720 --> 40:11.440]  for themselves hundreds of sheriff's departments hundreds are announcing at least 50 cuts and
[40:11.440 --> 40:16.880]  those that they keep will be revenue generation this is the design collapse this is designed
[40:16.880 --> 40:21.920]  barbarism you see this is the opposite of the enlightenment or the renaissance this is the
[40:21.920 --> 40:27.440]  reversal of society this is the destruction of humanity this is the post industrial world
[40:27.440 --> 40:34.000]  this is the new dark age this is the hunger games model where where where that's what
[40:34.000 --> 40:40.240]  agenda 21 is where we live in rural areas and are under calorie control and when we go above a
[40:40.240 --> 40:45.120]  certain calorie level we're going to be put into forced labor camps that's why the defense
[40:45.120 --> 40:51.200]  department's putting cameras in lunch rooms from florida to texas uh scanning the children and
[40:51.200 --> 40:56.240]  reports are being made children will also be taken if they're one pound overweight all of that has
[40:56.240 --> 41:01.200]  been announced this is the total phase in of just hell tsa is now operating checkpoints on
[41:01.200 --> 41:06.160]  highways all over the place uh they're now crushing testicles of those that don't submit to them
[41:06.160 --> 41:12.400]  robbing bags of those that don't submit to them as punishment uh it is just and again the average
[41:12.400 --> 41:22.640]  person who's accepted all this they hear me reporting on what's admitted and i'm bad for reporting it
[41:24.800 --> 41:32.080]  now again the secretary of defense has said an iran attack will be horrible that the last
[41:32.080 --> 41:37.840]  sec death has said it will be a catastrophe that could lead to a new world war most think tanks
[41:37.840 --> 41:43.840]  say that most analyst military and historical analysts say that but the bankers don't care they
[41:43.840 --> 41:50.080]  know they're about to ride that dragon ride that tiger they bring in a big enough global crisis a
[41:50.080 --> 41:58.160]  big enough global meltdown a big enough global uh catastrophe they're going to be able to then pose
[41:58.160 --> 42:03.600]  as the saviors just as they've implemented the derivatives worldwide crash the black hole impossible
[42:03.600 --> 42:09.440]  to pay back and signed us on to it and then have the prostitute media tell the public it's our debt
[42:09.440 --> 42:18.160]  when it's not our debt they know what they're doing one country called their bluff iceland
[42:20.080 --> 42:24.160]  and found out 90 plus percent of the debt was the bankers and not theirs and arrested
[42:24.720 --> 42:31.360]  the head bankers who had turned out were foreign banking agents this is a new kind of war this is
[42:31.360 --> 42:40.000]  a corporate carpet bagger style takeover this is economic warfare carpet bagger 2.0 worldwide
[42:42.640 --> 42:52.800]  and it's here and it's real and it's going to get insane as long as we don't have a mass awakening
[42:52.800 --> 42:59.200]  that the bad guys are the ones imploding things to reorganize and re-engineer and re-educate
[42:59.200 --> 43:05.600]  just as the communist run by the bankers did in the soviet union and did in communist china
[43:06.560 --> 43:12.320]  they want to implode things first that was declassified from the red terror under linen
[43:13.360 --> 43:17.040]  that was released by the russians the last few decades they've been releasing all that
[43:17.040 --> 43:21.040]  where it was admitted that they wanted to shut down production they wanted to starve people
[43:21.040 --> 43:25.840]  they wanted to cut the power off they wanted to shut everything off they know what they're doing
[43:25.840 --> 43:32.240]  they've got to destroy us they've got to bring us down and what i feel sorry for is the idiots that
[43:32.240 --> 43:37.840]  serve the system folks they are they're not bad people most of them they're idiots they're drawn
[43:37.840 --> 43:43.440]  from the general public that literally has never opened a history book and has no idea what we're
[43:43.440 --> 43:49.920]  staring at right now so panetta warrants conflict between syria and turkey may produce regional
[43:49.920 --> 43:58.160]  war and then in the video clip he goes on to say it is a war already no kidding new york times
[43:58.160 --> 44:04.720]  concedes that it is unknown whether syrian artillery came from rebels or government and
[44:04.720 --> 44:13.120]  turkey's still shelling them and has passed this declaration of war basically they don't call it
[44:13.120 --> 44:22.160]  that so it's not a war ap reports think tank path to iran nuke warhead two to four months so again
[44:22.160 --> 44:26.240]  the word is they're either going to hit him in late october early november or they're going to wait
[44:26.240 --> 44:32.080]  and hit whenever the new president whether it's the old president or romney in february and you
[44:32.080 --> 44:40.080]  can just type in warshet for next spring or late winter i don't know and they may not do it then
[44:40.080 --> 44:44.160]  there may be cooler heads prevail but they don't have the chairman of the joint chief saying this
[44:44.160 --> 44:48.560]  is a bad idea and the secretary of defense the last secretary of defense saying it's a bad idea
[44:48.560 --> 44:56.000]  and could be a catastrophe what did uh ron paul say two weeks ago about qe unlimited he said you
[44:56.000 --> 45:01.760]  should be panicking ron paul is absolutely right that q up that ron paul you should be panicking
[45:01.760 --> 45:06.800]  after i play this i'm going to go to your call sean herald josh robert nick everybody but this
[45:06.800 --> 45:17.680]  has got to be covered we now have mit romney the story is up at info wars dot com and i just had it
[45:17.680 --> 45:23.840]  here in front of me and i've got so many articles i now can't find it here it is romney vows to arm
[45:23.840 --> 45:30.240]  al qaeda terrorists in syria and again you've got the neocons saying obama didn't handle this al qaeda
[45:30.240 --> 45:36.720]  attack in libya properly you know he should have had more security nato runs al qaeda and put them in
[45:36.720 --> 45:46.480]  the country i mean that's admitted so none of them are even having a real debate and now romney
[45:46.480 --> 45:52.160]  has come out and is set to give a speech tonight but they've already released details of it saying
[45:52.160 --> 45:58.960]  we need to back the valiant rebels that are attacking syria i mean this is so immoral i have
[45:58.960 --> 46:06.160]  never seen a time in history where the public was so dumbed down that an elite would would would
[46:06.160 --> 46:12.160]  simultaneously say we've got to take all your rights and liberties because al qaeda is going
[46:12.160 --> 46:17.600]  to attack you at the airport or on the highway and that the tea party works with al qaeda that's in
[46:17.600 --> 46:25.920]  the new army manual i mean just ridiculous uh and that simultaneously they run al qaeda i mean real
[46:25.920 --> 46:33.360]  al qaeda we have the videos up there news articles over the weekend headline you know rebel leader
[46:33.360 --> 46:37.840]  al qaeda flag will we will not stop until al qaeda flag flies over winehouse well i mean it already
[46:37.840 --> 46:46.400]  does the globalist run al qaeda romney vows to arm al qaeda terrorists in syria info wars.com
[46:46.400 --> 46:51.520]  meant romney without armed syrian rebels today during a major foreign policy speech illustrating
[46:51.520 --> 46:55.600]  once again how there is virtually no difference between romney and obama when it comes to serving
[46:55.600 --> 47:00.160]  the interest of military industrial complex and he and he's saying there aren't enough troops on the
[47:00.160 --> 47:07.760]  ground they've got us advisors literally advising guys with al qaeda uniforms on and al qaeda flags
[47:07.760 --> 47:16.160]  that's in bbc roiders you name it la times i mean again this is all so off the charts
[47:16.160 --> 47:25.680]  let's go ahead and go to this video clip it's up at info wars.com we covered it last week
[47:26.560 --> 47:33.200]  breaking lobbyists we need a false flag to start war with iran patrick clausen of the
[47:33.200 --> 47:38.640]  influential neocon washington institute for near east studies openly suggest the u.s should provoke
[47:39.600 --> 47:45.040]  iran to taking the first shot now what did shaney want to do paint up a u.s boat like an iranian boat
[47:45.040 --> 47:52.080]  have navy seals attack but they had a cent com admiral falon ox falon said no and resigned
[47:52.080 --> 47:56.080]  this would have already happened ladies and gentlemen and again it will be bad for everybody
[47:56.720 --> 48:04.880]  seven eight nine ten dollar barrel gas or or a gallon of gas you know 200 300 dollar a barrel
[48:04.880 --> 48:12.000]  or crude oil but the globalists want to get this going here is the clip on c span they posted this
[48:12.000 --> 48:16.720]  on their own website dude they'll watch the whole speech it's incredible it's an hour long
[48:17.440 --> 48:22.400]  here it is here they are thinking you're so stupid they're talking about false flags on tv here it is
[48:24.000 --> 48:30.480]  i frankly think that crisis initiation is really tough and it's very hard for me to see how the
[48:30.480 --> 48:40.480]  united states president can get us to war with iran which leads me to conclude that if in fact
[48:40.480 --> 48:46.880]  compromise is not coming that the traditional way of america america gets to war is what would be
[48:46.880 --> 48:52.000]  best for us interests uh some people might think that mr roosevelt wanted to get us into world war
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.240]  two as david mentioned you may recall we had to wait for pearl harbor some people might think
[48:56.240 --> 49:00.480]  mr wilson wanted to get us into world war one you may recall he had to wait for the lucetani
[49:00.480 --> 49:05.280]  episode some people might think that mr johnson wanted to send troops to vietnam you may recall
[49:05.280 --> 49:11.280]  they had to wait for the gulf of tonkin episode we didn't go to war with spain until the uss until
[49:11.280 --> 49:17.520]  the main exploded and may i point out that mr lincoln did not feel he could call out the federal army
[49:17.520 --> 49:22.080]  until fort sumter was attacked which is why he ordered the commander at fort sumter to do exactly
[49:22.080 --> 49:28.960]  that thing which the south carolineans had said would cause an attack so if in fact the iranians
[49:28.960 --> 49:35.120]  aren't going to compromise it would be best if somebody else started the war one can combine
[49:35.120 --> 49:42.320]  other means of pressure with sanctions i mentioned that explosion on august 17th we could step up the
[49:42.320 --> 49:48.400]  pressure i mean look people iranian submarines periodically go down someday one of them might
[49:48.400 --> 49:55.200]  not come up who would know why we can do a variety of things if we wish to increase the pressure
[49:55.200 --> 50:03.200]  i'm not advocating that but i'm just suggesting that this is not a either or proposition of you
[50:03.200 --> 50:10.000]  know it's just sanctions has to has to succeed or other things we are in the game of using covert
[50:10.000 --> 50:17.440]  means against the iranians yeah we we could get nastier at that oh yeah oh oh like 9 11
[50:18.560 --> 50:24.160]  like peanut wrote in september 20 2000 a new pearl harbor event a catastrophic terror attack
[50:24.160 --> 50:32.960]  killing 3000 actually said 3000 boy they know what they're doing oh yeah we're not in kansas
[50:32.960 --> 50:38.000]  anymore ladies and gentlemen there is unlimited evil taking place right now does that mean the
[50:38.000 --> 50:44.320]  iranians are good no the iranian government no but this is what's happening and the bankers
[50:44.320 --> 50:49.040]  want this world war to bring in their world government as they've said they're going to
[50:49.040 --> 50:53.680]  use the crisis to bring in world government the banking crisis alone your calls are straight
[50:53.680 --> 51:04.640]  ahead stay with us erin fullen here as the food police shut down food co-ops the amish and small

[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:55.520]  east germany that's it i'm not coming back oh i hate this and then and they're like it's like a
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:14:02.480]  big carnival big carnival it's all part of your new conditioning to make sure you're not al-qaeda

[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:49.520]  down heading toward uh independence hall and i just stopped because i looked over and i said there's a
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:54.400]  tsa guy standing on the corner so i figured i'd go see what he was doing so i walked over to the
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:59.680]  corner and i i figured i asked directions just to see instead of asking anything else and he goes
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:03.600]  yeah straight down the street just keep walking straight i said okay so what are you guys doing
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:08.240]  here aren't you usually at the airport he goes we're just helping out giving directions oh yeah
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:13.840]  like the army and thousands of drills was just drilling for foreign countries but
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:22.400]  oh uh now they admit in south carolina and colorada in texas in lost angeles california
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:26.800]  everywhere they're just oh we're regular army we're here now to search you on the highway
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:30.800]  it's a free country really i thought that's why i don't go to mexico because of that but
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:35.680]  again um you called in probably about something else i didn't mean to divert you go ahead it's
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:40.320]  okay no that's fine i'm glad we got off in a couple different things but uh my mom started
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:45.120]  getting the flu shot five years ago now she has severe dementia and can barely speak thanks to the
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:51.760]  yeah ten years ago big studies came out just type it into the search engine uh all simers vaccines
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:57.680]  all simers flu shot and then a big study what was about a decade ago three flu shots doubles your
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:04.160]  chances of all simers that's why 25 year olds are getting all simers now but hey it's not a we
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:09.440]  shouldn't be it's good just take the shots roll over and die i mean dementia is you know
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:14.240]  well it's a horrible thing my grandfather got it before he died but what's the big deal i'm sorry
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:17.520]  go ahead i'm sorry to hear about your mother i shouldn't be joking around oh well thank you
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:23.520]  no no you i i just i like your uh candid it's a great candid guy so um i got one more point for
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:29.760]  you who do you think owns independence all in philadelphia uh the u n well you're right
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:35.200]  he did well the federal government owns it but but but but under treaty under treaty world heritage
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:42.000]  site they signed it over to the u n oh okay it's 45 acres there i guess they own the whole thing
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  because the national park service they they watch it with their guns and everybody's good
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.280]  like you said bugging their eyes out it's crazy there well yeah yeah uh guys type in independence
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:57.440]  all world heritage site and see what happens is the park service gets it and then under treaty
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:04.560]  they agree that it is to be regulated in perpetuity for all time by unesco uh in fact
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:10.960]  there's a unesco plaque at the facility well everybody all the national park service that
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.280]  i asked when i was there i said who owns you know independence on the ground it sits on they said
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:20.240]  oh philadelphia owns it everybody said the same thing philadelphia owns you could tell they were
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:26.400]  lying but that's they all said the same thing and i know it's nonsense because i looked it up it's
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:31.120]  right on the national park service site they said they took custody of a january 1st 1951
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:36.240]  yes and then they turned it over to the un there it is unesco culture world heritage the list of
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:45.040]  world heritage independence hall um under un control very sad well everybody there was lying
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:50.880]  you know they had a big you know 225th year you know celebration and the lady got up there from
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:56.960]  the national park service she said oh celebrate your building here is yours it's yours i'm like

[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:11.200]  that the independence hall had been on the list and they're actually been a controversy over the
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:16.480]  fact that they put a un plaque there saying it was uh under unesco control i don't know if it's
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:22.160]  still there but the guys type in unesco plaque at independence hall click images there's there'll
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:28.960]  probably a photo of it i was at the grand canyon two times in a row and the and the uh the the the
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:38.240]  global bots know to enforce on you and when i was there into 2000 uh no no no in 1997 when i was

[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:53.680]  in america destroyed by design and then i was back there last fall uh and they had moved the visitor
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:57.520]  center to a new complex and there was no one around and i was around the side of the building
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:04.320]  where they had the un signs and a slave bot came 30 yards or so out of his way where i was shooting
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.840]  a video because there's video of this uploaded to youtube and started interrupting me and saying he

[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:30.400]  it's the old parable of killing the messenger no good deed going unpunished and the guy tried to
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:35.360]  intimidate me he was like hold on honey this guy's got a problem i want to see what this is and i

[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:22.720]  if you leave me an american family during the great depression you can see the mother she's so
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:27.280]  incredibly skinny you see the baby the baby's fat because you know she's nursing it and literally
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:33.040]  giving up all her calories dying to feed them and then you see the older kids and they're real
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:39.600]  skinny as well and i think about a university study i forget which one they estimate seven
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:48.480]  million people starved to death during the great depression or died from um complications from
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:56.000]  malnutrition i think about how moral and how hard working people were back then i haven't
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:02.880]  romanticized them i've done a study of it they were just light years above what we are myself
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:09.360]  included people are so decadent so slob like and that's what's allowed incredible evil to
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:15.680]  just grow all around us we have to admit we're in trouble we have to admit we're in danger to turn
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:22.880]  this around i mean look i've probably had 200 conversations with my wife convincing her to
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:28.800]  sacrifice our family and stay here and to my wife's credit she's prayed about it and she says all right
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:33.280]  we'll stay here my wife's smart she's read a lot of history she's lived all over the world she knows
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:39.760]  she knows the cost this is real folks that's why i don't think some of you understand out there
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:44.560]  you know fighting the new world order isn't some stick or some fun thing you do
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:49.200]  for so many of the activists out there that over the years have turned out to be bad people
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:53.840]  this is all gonna happen it's all gonna come to fruition it's gonna be bad
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:26:00.560]  and we only hope to survive and have a remnant go through this but make no mistake god's watching
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:06.480]  each and every one of us and god knows our hearts and i just want to testify here on air that i am a
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:11.840]  wicked person but my heart loves god and loves good and i try to be good and i try to tell the
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:17.520]  truth and i try to be honest and i do not feel worthy to be a radio talk show host speaking to
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:24.640]  millions of people i am ashamed of the fact that i can't articulate what i know fully to you i
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:31.360]  i am not on some power trip and i just feel sorry for people out there that are because they have no idea
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:38.240]  that i really mean the things i say and i'm right about the things i say in general
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:45.440]  let me tell you folks we got some really evil people running things and and things are getting
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:52.080]  darker by the minute and it is a testament though to human liberty that so many am and fm
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:57.600]  stations are turning this show on right now because people have heard me as guest on shows
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:02.800]  they've heard the show the last 17 years station owners program directors general managers and
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:08.240]  they thought that guy's a lunatic but now they've seen it all come true much of it unfold and they're
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:12.400]  thinking wow this is really true we better do something about this and i appreciate the fact
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:19.840]  that people have courage when they see the facts i understand not wanting to believe this every day
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:27.360]  i wish to be wrong every day i wish this wasn't happening every day i think about how innocent
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:33.040]  my children are and how good they are but it's because they are innocent and they are good there
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:40.880]  is good in this world and i will not go along with the evil consciously that doesn't mean i'm high
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:45.840]  and mighty and have all the answers but i'm here to tell you folks i've studied history and i've
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:50.000]  studied the people that are running things right now believe me it didn't barack obama or mit romney
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:56.640]  and they want to hurt you and your family they want to shut down your jobs they want to ship
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:02.320]  your jobs overseas i was reading a comment in one of the videos on youtube at the alex jones channel
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:07.040]  where they've got a whole bunch of trolls and they're attacking me and one of my evil guilty
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:12.800]  pleasures is that's i like being attacked god has given me i guess this shield in my personality
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:19.600]  that when people lie about me and make stuff up and and cherry picker straw man that uh
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:26.000]  it's entertaining but i realize that's a sin and i've repented of that and i don't spend my time
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:31.520]  looking at that anymore not that i did a lot a few hours a week i mean i i'd call paul wadson i'd
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:36.080]  say what's the new attack you know it's it's so entertaining and i realize that's evil and i've
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:40.560]  told the office not to be part of that guilty pleasure as well because we don't have time to
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:45.920]  play games with all this uh and and and sit there and get into people attacking us and laughing at
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:53.600]  them uh it's sick but i here's a comment alex jones is the one setting up checkpoints nationwide

[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:05.120]  you that that's going on and it physically hurts me and physically makes me angry when i see these
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:11.680]  pr rollouts for vaccines that they know are making people sick giving them cancer and not
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:16.480]  protecting them from what they claim they're protecting them from it makes me physically
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:22.640]  angry because i've studied it i've had all the scientists and brain surgeons and medical doctors on
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:31.120]  one and big pharma is just so monstrous and just the last month there've been scores of cases where
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:37.440]  they've pled guilty to shooting people up with live viruses on purpose to cause epidemics and
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:42.880]  no one a drug's gonna kill kids for asthma and then and then pushing it out there i mean it just
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:49.920]  makes my head spin how many times have we learned about big pharma knowingly having hiv uh in a
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:58.000]  vaccine or a factor eight or hepatitis or it's again a vaccine lab that's putting out the meningitis
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:07.520]  right now right as they had stuff written a week ago saying you need the meningitis vaccines
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:14.400]  and then magically there's the outbreak i mean this this is so incredible
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:20.480]  a red magazine big feature story guaranteed written weeks ago
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:27.040]  right on time for the viral meningitis and bacterial meningitis outbreaks
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:35.520]  just like it came out in california that last year uh the uh whooping cough outbreak was from
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:41.040]  the vaccine guys type that in and show people if you're watching on prism punnet on tv but but the
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:46.960]  average person literally doesn't even know what's in a vaccine they don't even know that antibiotics
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:52.400]  are for bacteria not for viruses they don't even know anything i mean it it's it's in and i guess
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:58.480]  if i was a winner in quotes i would go join the globalist and feed on people and be a big globalist
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:04.480]  operative because i know how people work instead i'm here watching it in horror
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:13.200]  horror is engaged in now that's not it whooping cough vaccine proven short lived
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:19.360]  no no it came out that that they were actually spreading measles mumps rubella whooping cough
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:26.720]  from vaccines in california it was something like i think the headline is nine out of ten whooping
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:32.720]  cough cases from the vaccine it was mainstream news but because you've got real journalists
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:37.440]  reporting on it in the local papers and you've also got side by side the paid for garbage you
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:42.240]  know what i'm already getting into this now it i'm gonna cover it more after i get your calls

[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:31.200]  what are you in oregon are you in a former uh washington state and where are you calling from
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:38.080]  in fema region 10 i'm washington state all right formerly again part of the us now under global
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:44.160]  control here in occupied former united states uh what's on your mind today i want to let you know
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:50.240]  i'm a peace officer for the constitution of the united states well that's good that's what's wonderful
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:57.520]  news well i'll let you know alex i've uh trained in the new officer just come on in the last week
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:03.040]  and i uh sat him down and i explained to him even though you were a former marine you will follow
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:10.160]  the u.s constitution and you will know the bill of rights and i told him that uh police work is a
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:15.840]  lot of gray area and it's not black and white and we have a lot of discretion and we need to treat
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:22.240]  our citizens who pay our wages every month with respect and we're here to serve them and i told
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:27.040]  them that uh whatever they teach you at the academy i said you're going to come back and you're
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:32.160]  going to unlearn i said because most of the people that we deal with are which are bottom
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:37.200]  10 percent society are bad but the 10 the 90 percent of people are decent and they just want to be
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:43.760]  served respected and protected wow well i wish i lived in your town i mean there are so many
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:50.400]  good police and i hate to buy into the globalist program but it's it's hard to not do where they
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:56.080]  have these big city police federally trained they allow the bad ones to rise to the top
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:01.920]  show that the public starts fearing the police the police then know the public doesn't like them
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:08.960]  that then compacts them into a gang mentality so that they feel like it's us against them well it's
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:14.320]  now time to break that and uh there are still some good police academies in the country because
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:19.920]  i've read some of the curricula but more and more it is a militarized in your face system
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:27.840]  i mean overall uh you must be a small department or how are you stopping the globalist infiltration
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:35.840]  well uh you woke up about uh two years ago alex i came across uh info wars i don't know on the
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:42.800]  online or something but anyways i uh i uh get your um i buy the bulk of your new magazines i set those
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:48.160]  out around the town around the guys i work with we put on uh info wars uh nightly news in the
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:53.680]  morning time uh some of the guys i work with call it brainwashing tv but we watch it and uh
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:59.920]  uh and what's so what's great is i uh sat down a couple of my co-workers last week and we had
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:05.280]  pulled up the uh 27 amendments and we read through them and i told them listen guys we can't forget
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:11.280]  why we're here and i'm i'm fortunate i've been a cop for 15 years i'm a training officer
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:15.360]  and listen our department doesn't drink the federal fluoride so we don't go to their training so
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:22.640]  that probably helps very very exciting wow and again you know for guys that think they're being
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:28.640]  brainwashed with this type of information if anything i'm just burnt out so i rant and rave
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:34.240]  because i'm so sick of all this but i mean did they see the senate report i'm trying to find it
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:40.560]  here it is intelligence effort named citizens not terrorists never named one real terrorist
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:45.120]  and then it goes on the army new training manual characterizes people frustrated with
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:50.080]  mainstream ideologies as terrorists and believe in government conspiracies i mean look at fast
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:55.920]  and furious this is exactly what i've been saying for 10 years that there was never about al-qaeda
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:00.880]  they were going to flip it around on the american people i mean i mean any of the guys or or ladies
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:06.880]  that don't think there's some truth to what we're saying don't i mean it's admitted that al-qaeda is
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:13.200]  being used against syria i mean do they think anything about that well be awesome the alex i
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:19.040]  think um you know police department just like a demographic of the you know the citizens of the
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:24.080]  united states you've got a small percentage that are awake and the rest aren't because they're too
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:29.200]  busy you know uh worrying about their boats and all that kind of stuff but i i have learned i just
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:35.120]  keep uh laying seed on the ground and i just keep educating them and then you get guys the last
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:40.640]  question but you know the thing is the federal government and the and the money they provide
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:45.760]  is like crap and the problem is that these departments are getting addicted to it so they
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:50.640]  feel obligated to uh do what the federal government tells them because they're giving them giving them
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:54.880]  the money and and that's that the the local governments have to get off of federal boob
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:59.040]  i hear you and god bless you we're wonderful to hear you you call certain thank you for your
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:03.520]  service to the bill of rights the constitution to service to yourself you know when you serve
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:08.320]  ladies and gentlemen when you serve liberty and freedom all of us do that have chosen to fight
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:15.120]  for liberty because you got to fight for it you are serving yourself and your children and your
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:19.600]  family that's what's so frustrating we talk about cops all day they're nothing compared to bureaucrats
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:26.000]  and people on average that's your bill of rights and constitution too i mean that's that's that's
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:31.040]  that's what makes us different than north korea we're just more dirt if we don't have that that is
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:39.360]  precious people fought and died for that that's why you revere the flag because it represents
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:46.320]  the blue sky and god above and the stars in the sky the evidence of god's creation
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:55.440]  and you've got the red that signifies the blood that's been given to fight for liberty
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:02.880]  and then you've got the white that symbolizes the states going from memory what the american flag
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:11.040]  symbolizes but i think i basically got it right the point is is that look we're in a trance i don't
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:16.320]  know how else to explain this to people i mean i've got this article here with links to mainstream
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:23.040]  news where you've got members of congress the list goes on and on where tsa says we're going to punish
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:30.160]  you and grabs your genitals and starts crushing them and now the tsa is coming to police departments
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:35.760]  and saying we are going to give you federal training and then you're allowed to set up
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:41.120]  checkpoints at the basketball game or whatever and grope people why do they always create a new
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:47.920]  agency yet lure did it others have done it because the old agency will have some type of of code
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:55.280]  even the fbi you know tries to follow the bill of rights and constitution she can have the fbi in
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:47:01.040]  there saying oh now it's okay to go to the prom and and and grope everyone that comes in quote for
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:07.840]  their safety in this nanny state so they create the tsa and now tsa takes an eight hour course so
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:13.600]  they could supposedly read your mind and now all over the country they have the tsa training police
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:21.040]  well i've had a tsa course so now i can set up a checkpoint here on the side of the highway and dig
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:26.320]  through your stuff without warrants and grope you because the tsa said so because homeland security
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:32.320]  said so why they say the nsa can spouse without warrants it's illegal it's illegal
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:43.680]  and it's time to say no to all of this it's time to say no it doesn't have to get worse if we just
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:48.640]  wake up to it we'd already be in world war three right now if you didn't have the secretaries of
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:54.000]  defense and all these other people saying no no no but the bureaucracy is run by other people
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:58.480]  and that's why they want to go to war and i've got all that news i've already mentioned it let's

[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:13.120]  okay so i just read to you from Reuters and from wired magazine where they admit the terrorists
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:19.760]  are gun owning libertarian conservatives and veterans and that it is a total takeover of
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:25.680]  society and then i have articles where all over the country in the last week suddenly they're not
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:32.000]  even calling it drills now they're having army on the streets going through neighborhoods stopping
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:37.680]  cars searching vehicles and they're just announcing hey they're going to rotate through your towns
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:43.920]  this is pure acclimation for the collapse of society now remember they say they're doing it
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:50.320]  because of al-qaeda while they run al-qaeda and put al-qaeda into libyan syria but they're now
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:56.160]  phasing out big sisters said no no it is now domestic groups and they've got all these tv shows
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:55:02.160]  coming out like founding fathers homeland you name it where the veterans are terrorists
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:06.400]  that are going to blow everybody up and work with al-qaeda and the army manual will say
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:11.440]  the tea party works with al-qaeda that army manual came out a month ago we had stewart
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:20.160]  roads on about it so they're now branding over to weird word bob go he's with al-qaeda and they
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:29.280]  think you're so stupid they run al-qaeda publicly the banks that have hijacked our country and uh
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:35.360]  it's it's just pure evil they've got these young 20 year old men and women who play video games all
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:39.200]  day when they're not you know out in active duty that is that think they're gonna have a big war
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:45.040]  with us the older people well they're they're the main enemy they know the troops are gonna wake up
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:49.440]  so they're hoping the young troops aren't woken up before they can use them against the old troops
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:56.560]  hitler actually did that so did Stalin this actually is a normal thing under tyranny but but
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:56:02.000]  i need to shut up christian in arkansas a finisher story so yeah you called in about the name of
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:07.440]  they also have brigade homeland that's the term they use for a regular army in the streets of america
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:14.800]  uh empire shield but they also have troops in police uniforms pulling triggers on veterans
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:19.040]  when they have a veteran that they're going to raid their house for whatever the case is
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:23.680]  they send in army or marines this is highly classified information but we've confirmed it and
[01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:28.480]  they kill you in your house so that's part of a covert operation the cops think they've been
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:32.560]  led in on the big secret but but i'm sorry i finished your story about driving through saint
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:37.600]  louis well i was just going to say that my son i drove through st louis not terribly long ago and
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:42.240]  we saw we saw active duty troops patrolling about way or the loop whatever you call it around the
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:48.000]  city there and it just tied in neatly to the things that you've been saying and also as a veteran
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:53.120]  and i'm retired for ptsd i'm a veteran of close combat so they know that i that i'm one of the
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:58.800]  warfighters so them scooping people up the way they have been really concerns me and i'll say
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:04.960]  they lately point blank that uh should they come and pay me a visit i ain't going with them well
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:09.760]  and and once the civil war starts they'll be able to pick off like at the alamo they'll be able to
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:15.040]  pick off small groups of veterans by themselves but once they start killing the veterans and
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:20.160]  trying to arrest them the veterans aren't going to be waiting in their house the next time it'll
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:25.600]  be just like the alamo they'll be able to wipe groups of patriots out upfront but remember
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:29.920]  that's the beginning of the end for the globalist that's why they haven't killed me yet because they
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:36.960]  don't want alex jones to be a martyr a little alamo a little uh you know a goliad massacre
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:42.480]  they don't want to give us any martyrs up front they want to try to move in when will they move
[01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:47.040]  against us when they shut off a nuke in a major city and then say the tea party works for al qaeda
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:52.480]  that's that's a mean they're i mean can you imagine being in an officer group in the police or the
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:57.920]  military and they in a group and they're teaching officers this they're teaching them that the the
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:03.120]  tea party works for al qaeda and it's going to attack i mean that who buys that i mean come on
[01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:07.920]  folks who buys the veterans are the number one terror threat well yeah they're going to call
[01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:13.440]  veterans terrorists when they try to kill you and rounds you up does anybody realize the architecture
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:18.880]  of what they're setting up it's crazy anything else you'd like to add it's extremely difficult to
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:23.520]  convince people that's one of the things that i'm having the most difficult time with this is to
[01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:28.720]  convince folks that they've been duped yeah i know people don't want to admit they've been duped but
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:33.440]  ladies and gentlemen i mean you can give them roiders admitting homeland securities targeting
[01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:37.920]  the average american it has nothing to do with terrorism well they ride back stay with us
[01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:47.920]  you are listening to gcn got the big vaccine report visit gcmi.com system taking over the kids

[02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:32.240]  day the most important info how they're abusing our kids with these bio weapons known as vaccines

[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:51.920]  thank you for calling in today welcome hey uh i'm first time caller long-time listener
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:58.720]  and i was just wondering in canada what with this martial law comes what will happen in canada
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:06.240]  and uh what we should look out for here in canada for the coming days canada is owned and run by
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:10.640]  the queen as you know she has about half the property up there her uh governor general
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:16.800]  has suspended parliament three times they don't do it she orders uh and her propaganda arm is always
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:20.960]  you know advertising how powerless she is she's probably the most powerful person if not the most
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:31.120]  born Rothschild may be more powerful that's debated uh but canada appears to be a safe zone
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:39.440]  overall that they're gonna have social engineering forced inoculations a lot of arrest for your
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:47.760]  speech uh but canada is i'd have to say physically going to be safer than the united states during
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:58.560]  this engineering collapse i have to say um but again nothing's certain but um canada canada is
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:03.680]  ahead of us in many respects with the police state uh but but it's not being targeted for total
[02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:08.640]  reeducation because your scene is already being isolated and pretty much under their controls
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:15.040]  they can take their time with you later yeah well i've even looked and i i haven't seen much for
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:20.400]  the femur camps or anything around here in canada so i was just wondering for our canadian for the
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:29.440]  canadian viewers uh is what was going on only what are you 26 million people uh a little more i believe
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:34.880]  that 28 million now i forget something like that yeah i mean they need you to extract the resources
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:40.400]  right now right now they just want to break the us and western europe uh and japan fully for
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:44.640]  reengineering don't worry they'll get around to you later i mean they're they're giving you the shots
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:49.040]  and you got the higher cancer rates and stuff they're taking good care of you they're making sure
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:54.800]  but they're they're gonna take their time on you we're up next on the slaughter block like the russians
[02:02:54.800 --> 02:03:00.560]  were with the banker reengineering they dumped out the commies to get that job done uh but no
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:05.920]  you're not up next in the in the slaughter chute here at the slaughterhouse you're on up the up the
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:12.320]  chute a ways like i'd say canada is pretty much at the uh canada switzerland you're pretty much at
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:19.760]  the end of the line you're kind of the last in line some people say that if uh there was a war on
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:24.480]  the u.s that canada would be where people would send their troops through like we would be some
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:28.960]  sort of gateway or yeah but you're so huge i mean you're so huge what you got people on the west
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:34.560]  coast and east coast mainly the east coast i mean yeah i mean if they're gonna send russians over
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:40.400]  the north pole the russians aren't invading jack squad the russians are too busy robbing each other
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:44.960]  to get anything done the only time the russians are a problem is you attack them then they'll all
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:50.960]  mobilize and do whatever they're told the russians aren't ever an issue until you attack them then
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:59.440]  they all line up like army ants you better look out well thank you for helping me out with that
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:04.400]  and it's always good listening to your show thank you so much i appreciate your call yeah the russians
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:08.720]  are not an issue folks until you mess with them and then they'll just send everybody they have
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:13.920]  but the russians have gone from well their population down like 30 percent i mean the global
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:18.400]  that's why they've reversed the eugenics move and i'm not saying that mafia system's good but
[02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:23.040]  it's certainly not a scientific pure evil i mean the russians pay you to have kids
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:28.320]  you know the russians at least have some nationalism as bad as they are as bad as their
[02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:33.760]  corruption is they've already been down the new world order path they've somewhat broken away
[02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:38.160]  from it they're just trying to regroup and have some kids and the globalists want back in to take
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:42.720]  it over to get rid of the russians the american people are in the same boat as the russians
[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:48.160]  we shouldn't be enemies with them our enemies are the globalists that's our enemy we'll be right back
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:53.840]  i'm alex jones key report on the bio weapon attacks that are ongoing straight ahead are you

[02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:37.360]  monday through friday 11 a.m to 2 p.m central 12 noon at 3 p.m eastern i desperately
[02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:45.280]  sit here on air surrounded by pure evidence of absolute scientific evil taking over our planet
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:54.960]  and i desperately uh in the footsteps of paul revere tried to alert my fellow humans to evil
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:59.760]  running rampant now i don't like hugo chavez and then i'm getting into the vaccine news
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:05.360]  i don't like the oppression i don't like his communism he's not just a socialist
[02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:12.960]  i don't like some of his activities but i do know the west has used fake right wingers to also
[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:20.320]  exploit latin americans uh one of my crew members who does a great job working up here went back to
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:26.880]  venezuela to vote absolutely hates hugo chavez i had their family business basically taken over by
[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:36.560]  the communist and uh he's now won and that's either a triumph of election fraud uh though
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:44.160]  roiders is saying it's a convincing win they break that down or whether or not it's the triumph
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:49.520]  of having people on the dole more than half of venezuela gets some type of government benefit
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:56.640]  just like the us uh because once you go red i guess you don't really hardly ever go back
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:01.760]  until things totally collapse and the country has been rotting since chavez got control of it
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:08.560]  so uh that's um disgusting and i meant to mention that at the start of the show but there it is
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:13.440]  okay this information i'm about to cover
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:24.480]  is a life and death situation and i don't want listeners to take my word on this
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:29.280]  i want you to go research the claims that i'm going to make here today
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:34.080]  because uh vaccines
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:40.400]  are being pushed hundreds and hundreds of them on the population
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:48.000]  uh you see calls in the news to make an oculation mandatory for everyone and there's so many different
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:56.080]  angles and facets to all of this number one the media lies and says it's the law to take vaccines
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:02.640]  and that you will be arrested if your children don't take them or that it's the law to go to school
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:07.760]  that you have to have them we're in no state of the union is it the law to take vaccines now that's
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:14.640]  100% fact they have a waiver that they have at the health department to a non-law it's a
[02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:20.000]  regulation but they ask you to get it which then puts you on a list i don't do it
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:27.440]  okay they even try to force homeschoolers to do it uh my children end up going to the quasi
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:32.560]  private school homeschool where they're two days a week at the um private school three days a week
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:39.040]  at home we just explain and show people the paperwork we're not doing the waiver uh then
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:43.600]  there's the argument that well if you haven't had the shots and they do that in parade magazine
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:51.360]  that you're going to get others sick well wait a minute if you're protected by the deadly vaccine
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:58.400]  well then why should i have to take it why am i going to make you get it and what you see at
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:04.560]  in august before every school year you you hear it on radio you see it on tv read it the newspaper
[02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:11.840]  it's bombarding the public in july into august september that it's the law you will be arrested
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:16.080]  if your child doesn't have the shot and what they do is they kick your kid out don't tell you there's
[02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:21.360]  a waiver then they trigger truancy laws which the courts have found aren't applicable if
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:27.840]  they've kicked your kid out so it's constructive organized fraud so that's not a good place to
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:39.600]  start with the vaccines then you add that baer glaxo smith kline all the big vaccine conglomerates
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:48.160]  were found in the u.s england germany and france all were founded in those countries
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:55.280]  about 150 years ago and they develop a theory of eugenics and they funded the keiser villiam
[02:12:55.280 --> 02:13:03.200]  institute they got most nations on earth from japan to mexico by the 1930s to adopt eugenics
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:10.880]  they shut up family planning courts in japan mexico the u.s canada england germany the netherlands
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:17.760]  hundreds of countries the rothschilds the rockefellers uh the the british east india company
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:24.000]  the dutch east india company they would give millions of dollars and that was in 20s and 30s
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:30.800]  money to government officials if they would install this that's where you got family courts
[02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:34.960]  where there's no judge no jury they would order you in if you made a b minus or less they would
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:41.520]  sterilize you i've got clips of newsreels in my film in game so see i know what these health
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:48.720]  apartments are they're agents of racial hygiene i know the history and it's so frustrating to know
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:53.120]  fluoridation was a soviet model to reduce fertility and dumb people down and even have
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:58.880]  harvard studies out admitting it reduces iq we're being killed so they're lying to you saying it's the
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:10.000]  law they are also running around getting in everybody's face saying you're going to make
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:16.480]  other people sick if you don't take it and the point is is the entire history of big pharma
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:20.000]  remember four or five years ago i've used this a lot because everybody seems to have heard of this
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:27.600]  bayer pharmaceutical from australia to france to the us over 11 years was shipping out millions of
[02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:35.200]  ampoules of factor eight blood clotting agent two hemophiliacs and others knowing it had hiv
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:43.520]  and hepatitis in every ampoule and was a death sentence directly in intervenously you're going
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:47.840]  to get hepatitis you're going to get it and it was in the minutes where they knew and it was on
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:53.520]  purpose it wasn't that they didn't care about killing people they want you dead people say oh
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:59.360]  the elite doesn't care about us no no no oh they care a great deal about making sure you're in a
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:07.360]  pine box they care they they care a great deal about killing you let's get that straight
[02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:14.720]  and i'm here risking my life telling you this because we're now reaching the point ladies and
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:18.160]  gentlemen we're reaching millions of new people a week the system does not like this
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:23.920]  i've been called through different government functionaries i better shut up well you know
[02:15:23.920 --> 02:15:29.840]  what i'm not shutting up i'm not shining on to all these deaths it is a great honor if you destroy me
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:37.040]  because i was in the service of humanity i win i don't want to die i'm deep down nostalgic and
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:42.560]  sad for the life i could have led if i'm struck down but that's the cost of survival of the species
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:49.440]  that's what i fear for that's what i'm worried about and you eugenicist i indict you you're not
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:56.080]  trying to empower humanity you're not trying to build up your eugenics that you teach at the lower
[02:15:56.080 --> 02:16:04.880]  level that's the outer outer porch eugenicist is oh we kill the infirm the dumb the stupid
[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:09.920]  we don't let them breed or we kill them and then we breed the elites to make this perfect human
[02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:15.200]  but perfect to you as cold-blooded murderous and controlling you guys are all inbred and have a
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:20.320]  lot of medical problems if you study it that's why you're wanting to purify the race of humanity
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:26.400]  because you yourselves took already highly aggressive sociopathic people in many cases
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:32.480]  interbred those to make the super psycho breed that is elites worldwide whether they be japanese
[02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:39.040]  german jewish uh britannic it doesn't matter you all operate the same ruling class black
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:44.720]  san africa operate the same ruling classes in mezzo america act of the same i've studied the
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:50.960]  sociology the anthropology the archaeology i've studied it all and let me tell you folks i know
[02:16:50.960 --> 02:16:57.280]  what's going on and they are shedding a precedent to force into our bodies vaccines there's another
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:01.440]  lie there lies within lies within lies this is why i get so frustrated to communicate all this
[02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:10.560]  knowledge it is all inter multivariate connected interlaced interconnected
[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:19.280]  these aren't even vaccines in most cases these are viruses that are really lab engineered to the
[02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:25.280]  level of nanotech all the virus is they argue whether it's alive or dead it's a computer program
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:32.000]  it's it's it's it's alive but in the way a computer is it's a replicating self replicating
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:40.720]  dna rna it's rna but it programs dna okay and and we think of as a virus is bad there are many
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:45.840]  good viruses but the point is we just know are the bad ones because that's what's causing the
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:51.120]  problem that's what gets studied they've gone in and created nanotech re-engineering systems
[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:57.440]  that have i believe the evidence is clear already being used if they'll use fluoride
[02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:03.120]  dumbestown some of us are obviously immune for whatever reason there's a lot of studies showing
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:09.920]  that if you already have the papillomavirus that it will block the uptake of the same families that
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:15.840]  are used as jump carriers and i've had scientists on about that but the point is is that they're
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:22.480]  already the public's already exhibiting zombiosis basically to use that term zombification
[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:26.960]  there's a big study out today about tv zombifying people even if it's passively on the background
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:32.480]  to where they can't even communicate so what they're calling vaccines aren't even really vaccines
[02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:39.440]  these new classes it's something they inject into you that attacks certain brain cells attacks
[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:47.840]  certain organs certain glands re-engineers things changes your dna but the point is i now see the
[02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:52.480]  second wave they always do it in august and they always do it again october november pushing the
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:59.120]  flu vaccines you walk into a wallgreens or a or a cvs or any of these stores it's literally 20 30
[02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:04.160]  40 sides everywhere get your shot and they're pushing it at you at the counter and then it gets
[02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:10.080]  into the hoax and i'll cover when we get back the main report that they've never chosen the right flu
[02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:16.560]  to guess the year before what it's going to be that year so it's never helped anybody
[02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:22.800]  but it isn't meant to how do you trust big pharma that's got a history of killing troops and secret
[02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:28.320]  experiments and killing hemophiliacs and injecting black people with syphilis and latin americans
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:33.200]  and american troops and nerve-gassing them i mean it's like you wouldn't let these people
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:36.400]  you wouldn't want to live next door to them you wouldn't want to live in the same block
[02:19:36.400 --> 02:19:39.200]  i mean you want to be scared of somebody the this is them
[02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:46.080]  they are the greatest fusion of evil you can imagine because they're inner bread
[02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:52.640]  and as you know in any mammal species interbreeding creates all sorts of psychotic behavior on top
[02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:58.240]  of the genetic aggression that they have from leadership traits hyper mutated into the ruling

[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:33.840]  good people can stand up and defeat tyranny anytime they want to
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:40.480]  as the song says we got to come straight on and just tell it like it is
[02:24:40.480 --> 02:24:49.360]  the reality is wild all right let's get back to the vaccines show i start seeing without even looking
[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:58.080]  four or five six articles every day in fact every paper this weekend i picked up the statesman
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:03.360]  and flipped through it and found an article pushing vaccines i mean it's it's pr in most cases it's
[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:12.240]  paid for and parade magazine is a advertisement insert of thousands of newspapers across the
[02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:20.000]  united states and it says one lucky little girl when she was just 15 months old the little girl
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:24.480]  in minnesota almost died during an outbreak of bacterial meningitis here's what her ordeal can
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:30.800]  tell us about the hidden dangers of the anti vaccine movement now folks the vaccine movement
[02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:35.920]  is people that have been damaged by it and then it's got the article uh right here oh you know
[02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:40.320]  they wish they would have done it they wish they would have gone along and you know somebody
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:44.000]  doesn't take it then they spread it to other people well wait a minute i thought if you have
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:50.640]  the vaccine you're protected and it you know dispels the so-called myths well here's the deal
[02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:56.960]  print mainstream media isn't even going to exist soon because people know what you're about
[02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:02.560]  it says parents who skip some vaccines are delay the age at which they're given
[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:06.720]  and then it just goes through and basically demonizes all those people
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:13.520]  so should unvaccinated children be permitted in public schools this is all the eugenics movement
[02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:17.040]  setting the precedent that they're the good guys and they're going to tell you what's safe
[02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:22.800]  now you can argue whether the science of of of immunization is real or not or is dangerous
[02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:28.640]  but there's no debate that the people running big pharma are evil and have been caught in every
[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:34.000]  scandal you can imagine look at this article out of the news dash journal the news journal
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:39.200]  this is out of texas take your medicine getting a flu shot is part of being a good neighbor
[02:26:39.920 --> 02:26:42.880]  and it basically says you're going to disease everyone if you don't take it
[02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:47.200]  and the public's so dumbed down they think yeah i've had my shot but you're going to give it to
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:55.520]  me if you haven't had yours hey moron you supposedly took it now listen to this they go on to say
[02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:02.560]  there is absolutely no harm from getting a vaccination don't let yourself be fooled by
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:10.880]  wrong rumors no proof no fact but then they go on to say oh but it's not a hundred percent
[02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:14.880]  safeguard to get the shot you won't get the flu see because they know people are going man i got
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:20.640]  sick after i took that and they say yeah you might feel puny you might get sick but that's part of
[02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:29.840]  being well i just i just read from this and this same thing is in parade different variants of it
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:35.440]  it's it's everywhere it's on the nightly news and what are reporters do they go regurgitate this
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:40.800]  and then wonder why their news directors tell them to write about this or or or do a radio show or
[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:47.680]  a tv show about this because you look at the ads half the ads in some of these newspapers are big
[02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:54.160]  pharma tv turned it on at night it they run the show and they now have government run healthcare
[02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:58.880]  and of the model states health emergency powers act they say they're going to make people take it
[02:27:58.880 --> 02:28:02.560]  have you go back 10 years ago they tried to make 14 million first responders take it
[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:07.600]  try to make them take smallpox it killed a bunch of people so they stopped it now let me just go
[02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:13.360]  over some articles about what this is doing to people flu jab linked to fits in under fives
[02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:18.160]  and it says doc this is london telegraph doctors have been told don't give it under fives because
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:24.640]  of a tenfold increase in epilepsy some of it permanent in children that got the flu shot
[02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:30.160]  that's in england i mean so obvious they had to stop whoa whoa this this batch a little too strong
[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:34.160]  we're only supposed to hurt some of them don't go all the way this will even wake the doctors up
[02:28:34.160 --> 02:28:40.720]  gotta move slower gotta move slow okay hey by the way you heard them say it say conspiracy theory
[02:28:40.720 --> 02:28:50.080]  or or or what was the quote wild rumors wild rumors don't be oh well here's the cdc 20 pages

[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:10.480]  insane i mean this country just at every level is going straight to hades and a handbasket
[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:21.280]  it we i mean we are under psych warfare attack and i'm sitting here looking at so many cases of
[02:42:21.280 --> 02:42:27.600]  them i've got articles here mainstream 67 000 kids in india last year paralyzed ever being given the
[02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:34.400]  polio vaccine i mean it's insane paralysis cases spike in wake of bill gates polio vaccination

[02:42:57.440 --> 02:43:00.400]  abc news reported on that mercola was uh linked to that
[02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:12.560]  it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:21.520]  and on and on and on and then i constantly run into yuppies and they're usually college grads
[02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:26.480]  with a with a you know phd and biology you know a doctorate and that and they'll sit there and go
[02:43:26.480 --> 02:43:29.280]  Yeah. So what if they're putting stuff in the food and water?
[02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:32.360]  There's too many people and I look at them and I say, did you get a memo
[02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:35.040]  not to drink the Florida water to not take the vaccines?
[02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:40.040]  And sometimes they'll look at you and go, yeah, I remember having the state
[02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:42.640]  attorney on five years ago. You remember the case?
[02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:46.800]  They were able to actually, they actually found the video of it from CNN and stuff
[02:43:46.800 --> 02:43:50.440]  in a greater good DVD film, exposing vaccines.
[02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:53.800]  They actually dug it up where they had thousands of kids in Maryland
[02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:57.360]  lined up at one courthouse, crying with police dogs, saying,
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:43:59.360]  it's the law to take the shots. And they're like, I'm scared.
[02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:03.000]  I don't want to do it. The parents were there and I have the state attorney on.
[02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:10.600]  And he admitted he didn't vaccinate his kids for laughing.
[02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:13.280]  I mean, these people are crazy, man. They're crazy.
[02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:18.800]  I mean, the God fear I've got, I don't have to ever go to a church to get it.
[02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:22.600]  Man, when I even think about somebody that is joking, they don't give
[02:44:22.600 --> 02:44:26.720]  shots of their kids, but their color of law caught another kids to take it.
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:30.840]  I mean, that may, and they think it's funny that they are leading people into destruction,
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:35.920]  leading the little ones that suffer the children better to tie a millstone around your neck.
[02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:40.880]  I can feel, I can feel God's wrath.
[02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:45.320]  I mean, I just, that's what God fear is, is that you know what's right
[02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:48.600]  and you know what's wrong. You know what your conscience is. That's God fear.
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:52.240]  I don't fear those that can kill my body.
[02:44:52.240 --> 02:44:56.640]  I fear, I fear the, the great spirit that can cut me off.
[02:45:00.080 --> 02:45:02.200]  That's all hell is being cut off from God.
[02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:06.160]  And let me tell you, they're going to serve evil to think evil is powerful and pretty.
[02:45:06.160 --> 02:45:09.280]  And you like it. You have no idea. You have no idea.
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:11.800]  I have seen into the minds of the evil.
[02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:15.640]  I have seen it and it has irrevocably affected me.
[02:45:15.640 --> 02:45:21.600]  You just, just, just knowing it, the knowledge that I, I have researched and received.
[02:45:21.600 --> 02:45:23.400]  It's more than just researched it.
[02:45:23.400 --> 02:45:30.720]  And let me tell you, you have no idea the gulfs of black evil that you are descending into.
[02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:35.520]  This, this culture of death, this culture of evil.
[02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:39.160]  Oh my God. And the innocent children, they're shooting up everywhere right now
[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:42.720]  with hundreds and hundreds of shots by the time they're 10 years of age.
[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:45.840]  And you, I go out to restaurants and places and you look at the kids,
[02:45:45.840 --> 02:45:47.720]  they're all look mentally retarded now.
[02:45:49.240 --> 02:45:52.440]  Or you can walk over the kids, all look healthy and have electricity in their eyes.
[02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:56.840]  Let me guess, you eat nothing but non GMO and your kids have not been vaccinated.
[02:45:57.360 --> 02:45:59.880]  I actually do this. They'll go, yeah, Alex, we're listeners too.
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:04.920]  And I think of how they're robbing them.
[02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:09.360]  Oh my God. And setting the precedent is just see what they can do to us.
[02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:10.720]  See how they can hurt us.
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:12.720]  See what they can do.
[02:46:12.720 --> 02:46:17.720]  And the average doctor is just a, you know, brainwashed person that won't admit that they've been wrong.
[02:46:20.720 --> 02:46:23.720]  And so they just, they just go along with it.
[02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:27.720]  All right. Look at this great evil.
[02:46:27.720 --> 02:46:33.720]  Then I'll go to some of your phone calls on 880 AM in Arkansas and other stations.
[02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:38.720]  A front group for the psycho pharmacological industrial complex.
[02:46:38.720 --> 02:46:42.720]  Let me find the world net daily original article because it's the same story,
[02:46:42.720 --> 02:46:44.720]  but now it's being implemented.
[02:46:44.720 --> 02:46:46.720]  This program got stopped by Congress.
[02:46:47.720 --> 02:46:51.720]  Bush signed an executive order back in 2004.
[02:46:51.720 --> 02:46:53.720]  See, I said five years ago, time just flies.
[02:46:53.720 --> 02:46:54.720]  This is eight years ago.
[02:46:54.720 --> 02:46:56.720]  No, no, six, six and a half years ago.
[02:46:57.720 --> 02:46:58.720]  2004.
[02:46:58.720 --> 02:47:01.720]  Bush to screen population for mental illness.
[02:47:02.720 --> 02:47:04.720]  And one of their own insiders blew the whistle.
[02:47:04.720 --> 02:47:08.720]  Back in, you know, four out of Pennsylvania, one on the personal, the national board,
[02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:13.720]  and they have all this in here that big pharma wrote this up to go from 20% of the population,
[02:47:13.720 --> 02:47:17.720]  including kids on psychotropic to 50% is the goal.
[02:47:19.720 --> 02:47:21.720]  And it got held back.
[02:47:21.720 --> 02:47:26.720]  Now, October 1st or eight days ago, it began implementation in the public schools.
[02:47:27.720 --> 02:47:31.720]  And it's written by big pharma to put your kids on these drugs.
[02:47:31.720 --> 02:47:37.720]  And then once again, when the state has you 69% of foster kids are on an average of seven psychotropic.
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:38.720]  And it gets so bad.
[02:47:38.720 --> 02:47:43.720]  The goal, they've had medical doctors go public in a WHO AI investigation in San Antonio,
[02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:46.720]  that then the convulsion start and then that's even better.
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:52.720]  Now you put them on anti anti convulsive medicine and then they kill a lot of them with the drugs.
[02:47:52.720 --> 02:47:55.720]  I mean, the state will put a kid on so many drugs, it kills them.
[02:47:56.720 --> 02:47:57.720]  That's a soft kill victory.
[02:47:57.720 --> 02:48:03.720]  We have the head of the state psychiatry board in the end game telling the state legislature,
[02:48:03.720 --> 02:48:07.720]  she's Susanna Hupp at the Congress was the state rep woman.
[02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:12.720]  She says, well, why are more than two thirds of the kids on psychotropic in Texas?
[02:48:12.720 --> 02:48:14.720]  They said, well, they come from bad gene pools.
[02:48:14.720 --> 02:48:15.720]  She's like, do you do any tests?
[02:48:15.720 --> 02:48:18.720]  No, they just come from bad gene pools.
[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:21.720]  Yeah.
[02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:22.720]  Yeah.
[02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:23.720]  Well, you know what?
[02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:25.720]  You don't sign me on to hurting kids.
[02:48:25.720 --> 02:48:26.720]  Okay.
[02:48:26.720 --> 02:48:28.720]  You can sign me off of that.
[02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:30.720]  And if you don't like it, you can kill me right now.
[02:48:30.720 --> 02:48:33.720]  I'm going to resist you with the info war 110%.
[02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:36.720]  I'm glad you've signed on to your evil.
[02:48:36.720 --> 02:48:42.720]  I'm actually not glad, but those of you that consciously love the ultimate sin and know you're evil and you think you get power.
[02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:47.720]  I'm glad you're going to get what's coming to you because I'm not worried about my body.
[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:48.720]  And let me tell you something.
[02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:54.720]  You are going to get repaid a trillion times for what you do to children.
[02:48:54.720 --> 02:48:56.720]  I just hope you understand that.
[02:48:56.720 --> 02:48:58.720]  I hope you understand that.
[02:48:58.720 --> 02:48:59.720]  I hope you understand that.
[02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:03.720]  I hope you understand that you think it's fun to hurt innocent people.
[02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:05.720]  You think it's fun to hurt little children.
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:11.720]  You think it's fun, all the horrible things, those thousands of paralyzed kids in India from just last year's attacks.
[02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:13.720]  You think that's fun what you're doing.
[02:49:13.720 --> 02:49:15.720]  Those little kids paralyzed for life.
[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:16.720]  Those that lived.
[02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:19.720]  You think that's fun ruining their hopes and dreams.
[02:49:19.720 --> 02:49:20.720]  Make me sick.
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:23.720]  Make me sick.
[02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:26.720]  Scraping for mental disorders in children and adolescents.
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:29.720]  This is out now.
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:35.720]  And they're announcing how wonderful it is in the public schools and other schools.
[02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:37.720]  How all of this has started.
[02:49:37.720 --> 02:49:39.720]  That's a story from last year.
[02:49:39.720 --> 02:49:42.720]  Actional or mandatory health screening for children.
[02:49:42.720 --> 02:49:45.720]  That's Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.
[02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:47.720]  That's a group exposing it.
[02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:48.720]  We need to get them back on.
[02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:50.720]  That was a good guess when I had that doctor to head of that on.
[02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:52.720]  Where's the new one I had today?
[02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:55.720]  October 6th. Government sponsored Mind Control in America.
[02:49:55.720 --> 02:49:57.720]  The teen screen scam.
[02:49:57.720 --> 02:49:59.720]  Yeah, death education.
[02:49:59.720 --> 02:50:01.720]  Teaching kids how to commit suicide so they won't do it.
[02:50:01.720 --> 02:50:03.720]  Has massively increased suicide.
[02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:04.720]  Where's my new article?
[02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:06.720]  I've got a new article out today on this.
[02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:07.720]  Health Aware.
[02:50:07.720 --> 02:50:10.720]  Free depression screenings at Lyndon Oaks.
[02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:12.720]  Here's one of the hundreds of new articles.
[02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:16.720]  It constrain relationships, hurt your performance at work or school,
[02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:19.720]  and make you not want to get out of bed in the morning yet.
[02:50:19.720 --> 02:50:21.720]  It's called television watching and GMOs.
[02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:24.720]  Yet depression often goes undiagnosed and untreated.
[02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:25.720]  Well, don't worry.
[02:50:25.720 --> 02:50:28.720]  If you have lack of motivation, if you have any stress, if you're upset,
[02:50:28.720 --> 02:50:31.720]  well, just call us and we'll get you hopped up.
[02:50:31.720 --> 02:50:33.720]  So that's going on in the public schools right now.
[02:50:33.720 --> 02:50:36.720]  When you put your child in the government training camp,
[02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:38.720]  and I know they've bankrupted everybody so they have to,
[02:50:38.720 --> 02:50:40.720]  you're putting them in there to be victimized.
[02:50:40.720 --> 02:50:43.720]  So if you've got to stay in a government training camp,
[02:50:43.720 --> 02:50:45.720]  let's have a jailbreak.
[02:50:45.720 --> 02:50:49.720]  Educate and inform your children and give them information like our magazine
[02:50:49.720 --> 02:50:52.720]  that you can buy at cost to go and give to prisoners
[02:50:52.720 --> 02:50:55.720]  so they understand we can use the prison complex
[02:50:55.720 --> 02:50:58.720]  as a place to try to wake people up to the attack they're under.
[02:50:58.720 --> 02:51:20.720]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:28.720 --> 02:51:57.720]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:58.720 --> 02:52:02.720]  Hi there.

[02:52:15.720 --> 02:52:18.720]  for what they really are, incompetent, lying crooks
[02:52:18.720 --> 02:52:20.720]  that are counting on your ignorance and fear
[02:52:20.720 --> 02:52:23.720]  to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:52:23.720 --> 02:52:25.720]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:52:25.720 --> 02:52:28.720]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked
[02:52:28.720 --> 02:52:31.720]  to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:52:31.720 --> 02:52:35.720]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth
[02:52:35.720 --> 02:52:39.720]  and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[02:52:39.720 --> 02:52:42.720]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons
[02:52:42.720 --> 02:52:44.720]  have already seen in the last three months.

[02:52:56.720 --> 02:53:00.720]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:53:00.720 --> 02:53:02.720]  What do you do when your propane runs out
[02:53:02.720 --> 02:53:05.720]  and you don't have a large amount of wood for cooking?
[02:53:05.720 --> 02:53:08.720]  That's when you need a Grover Rocket Stove from stockstorage.com.

[02:54:06.720 --> 02:54:08.720]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls.
[02:54:08.720 --> 02:54:10.720]  To be the sad man.
[02:54:10.720 --> 02:54:14.720]  Turkey shells Syria for six days, says worst case scenario,
[02:54:14.720 --> 02:54:18.720]  unfolding, threatening, ground invasion.
[02:54:18.720 --> 02:54:23.720]  And through Turkey they're bringing in tens of thousands of al-Qaeda,
[02:54:23.720 --> 02:54:26.720]  Obama's endorsing it, Romney's endorsing it.
[02:54:26.720 --> 02:54:31.720]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:34.720]  Man, they just prey on the total ignorance of the public.
[02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:38.720]  It's just amazing.
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:43.720]  A bunch of other key articles up at infowars.com as well.
[02:54:43.720 --> 02:54:45.720]  It's going to get so crazy.
[02:54:45.720 --> 02:54:49.720]  And they now, Secretary of Defense admits that there's a fight
[02:54:49.720 --> 02:54:52.720]  between Shiites and Sunnis starting a civil war.
[02:54:52.720 --> 02:54:56.720]  Well, that's what I told you months ago is the plan in the region.
[02:54:56.720 --> 02:54:58.720]  To get those people all to kill each other.
[02:54:58.720 --> 02:55:01.720]  And then use it as a pretext to take our liberties.
[02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:04.720]  That's what's even worse about this is they also then use it
[02:55:04.720 --> 02:55:10.720]  to take my freedoms and your freedoms.
[02:55:10.720 --> 02:55:13.720]  Wow, new congressional amendment prepares for mass casualties
[02:55:13.720 --> 02:55:16.720]  in America. That has not passed the house yet.
[02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:18.720]  I misread that yesterday.
[02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:22.720]  American undergraduates were recruited for population control.
[02:55:22.720 --> 02:55:26.720]  TSA workers smacked me in my testicles for refusing body scan.
[02:55:26.720 --> 02:55:27.720]  I should have gotten to that.
[02:55:27.720 --> 02:55:29.720]  That is the most incredible article.
[02:55:29.720 --> 02:55:32.720]  Because Washington has all these links to Congress people.
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:36.720]  Miss USA, you name it, where they're told you're going to be punished now.
[02:55:36.720 --> 02:55:38.720]  And then they crush your testicles.
[02:55:38.720 --> 02:55:40.720]  Or they rob your money and say it's for punishment.
[02:55:40.720 --> 02:55:42.720]  Or they say you can't fly and it's for punishment.
[02:55:42.720 --> 02:55:44.720]  And we have all the videos of them admitting it.
[02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:48.720]  I mean, it's just like they're torturing us now as it's total joke
[02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:50.720]  because Al Qaeda might get us.
[02:55:50.720 --> 02:55:52.720]  And then meanwhile, the government runs Al Qaeda.
[02:55:52.720 --> 02:55:54.720]  It's just totally insane.
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:57.720]  That's all up at info wars.com and prison.
[02:55:57.720 --> 02:55:59.720]  Get that article out of the featured news out to everybody.
[02:55:59.720 --> 02:56:03.720]  Let's go to Frank in Arkansas listing on 880 a.m.
[02:56:03.720 --> 02:56:07.720]  K L R G. Welcome to the airwaves, sir.
[02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:09.720]  How you doing, sir? I appreciate you.
[02:56:09.720 --> 02:56:13.720]  I wanted to just let you know that you woke me up.
[02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:18.720]  And I just started listening to you recently in the last couple of months.
[02:56:18.720 --> 02:56:20.720]  I think you're doing a great job.
[02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:24.720]  And it's really hard to try to talk to people about all the stuff that's going on
[02:56:24.720 --> 02:56:25.720]  just because they don't seem to...
[02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:27.720]  Same thing in Nazi Germany.
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:31.720]  Up until 45, most Germans did not know they were killing people in mass.
[02:56:31.720 --> 02:56:33.720]  It was rumors.
[02:56:33.720 --> 02:56:35.720]  And it's the same deal.
[02:56:35.720 --> 02:56:38.720]  When scientists went public, they were injecting black people with syphilis.
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:41.720]  No one believed it for 20 years until it was released.
[02:56:41.720 --> 02:56:46.720]  I mean, it's like no one ever wants to believe that bad things are happening.
[02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:48.720]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:56:48.720 --> 02:56:50.720]  Yeah, no, just that.
[02:56:50.720 --> 02:56:53.720]  The other thing I wanted to talk about was I drive a truck
[02:56:53.720 --> 02:57:00.720]  and I noticed a lot of police vehicles and it says U.S. Federal Police Services on the side.
[02:57:00.720 --> 02:57:04.720]  No, they now have federal police everywhere, totally out of their jurisdiction.
[02:57:04.720 --> 02:57:08.720]  And TSA, who aren't even foreign officers.
[02:57:08.720 --> 02:57:14.720]  And they've got Homeland Command Rural Counsel, which is run by the Pentagon
[02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:18.720]  and says the plainclothes army are going to spy on rural communities.
[02:57:18.720 --> 02:57:20.720]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:22.720]  It's a takeover.
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:24.720]  Hmm.
[02:57:24.720 --> 02:57:25.720]  I appreciate you, sir.
[02:57:25.720 --> 02:57:26.720]  I just want to say God bless you.
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:27.720]  You're doing an awesome job.
[02:57:27.720 --> 02:57:29.720]  No, God bless you.
[02:57:29.720 --> 02:57:34.720]  Just again, ladies and gentlemen, it's worse than I can even say.
[02:57:34.720 --> 02:57:39.720]  Let's go ahead and talk to Richard in Arizona.
[02:57:39.720 --> 02:57:41.720]  You're on the air, Richard.
[02:57:41.720 --> 02:57:43.720]  Alex, I just, I know you're almost done here.
[02:57:43.720 --> 02:57:46.720]  I've got one important point I want to make.
[02:57:46.720 --> 02:57:52.720]  I've been a private health researcher and investigator since 1965.
[02:57:52.720 --> 02:58:01.720]  And I have not seen one piece of evidence indicating any kind of disease prevention from any kind of vaccination.
[02:58:01.720 --> 02:58:11.720]  Well, yeah, they've got a major scientist on worldwide hygiene and plumbing by the 20s and 30s is what reduced pathogenic spread.
[02:58:11.720 --> 02:58:18.720]  And then when vaccines became widespread by the 40s, you actually see an increase in infectious diseases previous the dip.
[02:58:18.720 --> 02:58:20.720]  I mean, is that what you're basically talking about?
[02:58:20.720 --> 02:58:28.720]  I'm going back to the 1600s and looking at the beginning of when they were used in countries like Denmark and Germany and other ones.
[02:58:28.720 --> 02:58:33.720]  And it was kind of just a crazy experiment in the beginning.
[02:58:33.720 --> 02:58:34.720]  I tell you what, stay there.
[02:58:34.720 --> 02:58:35.720]  We're doing some overdrive.
[02:58:35.720 --> 02:58:50.720]  Yeah, that's Malthusian Science, 280 years old.
[02:58:50.720 --> 02:58:51.720]  Aaron Fullen here.
[02:58:51.720 --> 02:58:58.720]  As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers, Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses,
[02:58:58.720 --> 02:59:03.720]  but to healthy homecrafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt and kefir.
[02:59:03.720 --> 02:59:07.720]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[02:59:07.720 --> 02:59:10.720]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[02:59:10.720 --> 02:59:13.720]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history,
[02:59:13.720 --> 02:59:18.720]  with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[02:59:18.720 --> 02:59:23.720]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi,
[02:59:23.720 --> 02:59:26.720]  and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[02:59:26.720 --> 02:59:27.720]  But here's some good news.
[02:59:27.720 --> 02:59:33.720]  American Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes,
[02:59:33.720 --> 02:59:36.720]  since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[02:59:36.720 --> 02:59:39.720]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.
[02:59:39.720 --> 02:59:41.720]  That's fermentationfactor.com.
[02:59:41.720 --> 02:59:47.720]  It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods, and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com.
[02:59:47.720 --> 02:59:51.720]  That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[02:59:51.720 --> 02:59:55.720]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.720 --> 02:59:59.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:26.720 --> 03:00:31.720]  Again, the globalists are trying to manage our poisoning and death,
[03:00:31.720 --> 03:00:36.720]  and then they profit off of sucking all the money we've shaved out of us.
[03:00:36.720 --> 03:00:39.720]  They have actuaries all breaking it down, and that's what's going on.
[03:00:39.720 --> 03:00:44.720]  The average doctor, the average nurse, they're just brainwash technicians, overworked,
[03:00:44.720 --> 03:00:48.720]  picked because they'll follow orders, compartmentalized.
[03:00:48.720 --> 03:00:54.720]  But we were talking to Richard and Arizona, a healthcare researcher.
[03:00:54.720 --> 03:01:00.720]  Yeah, if you go back, what, 400 years or so of the first smallpox inoculations,
[03:01:00.720 --> 03:01:04.720]  which were just taking the pus out of cows and putting it on humans,
[03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:07.720]  and memory serves, and then from other humans to other humans.
[03:01:07.720 --> 03:01:11.720]  And we've got British manuals about how to give smallpox blankets to the Indians.
[03:01:11.720 --> 03:01:14.720]  I mean, bio weapons are an old system.
[03:01:14.720 --> 03:01:22.720]  We have the Huns catapulting plague-ridden, black plague bodies over into the Chin cities or Chinese cities.
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:26.720]  So yeah, you're definitely right about that in what Malthus, 200 plus years ago,
[03:01:26.720 --> 03:01:31.720]  he said, cram people into compact cities, release plague on them to get rid of the scum.
[03:01:31.720 --> 03:01:34.720]  Tell us more about your research.
[03:01:34.720 --> 03:01:41.720]  Well, basically, my research is in about, you know, the basics of how to actually get rid of disease
[03:01:41.720 --> 03:01:43.720]  without needing the medical system.
[03:01:43.720 --> 03:01:48.720]  But what I was talking about with the history of vaccination is that in the beginning,
[03:01:48.720 --> 03:01:55.720]  in the 16 and 1700s and afterwards, when these experiments were done and vaccination was tried as an experiment
[03:01:55.720 --> 03:01:59.720]  in quite a few different countries, sometimes made forcible even back then,
[03:01:59.720 --> 03:02:04.720]  it always created plagues of the same disease that it was supposed to be.
[03:02:04.720 --> 03:02:06.720]  You know, I've seen evidence of that over the years.
[03:02:06.720 --> 03:02:11.720]  I mean, look at the plagues they're causing in India right now with the oral polio vaccine.
[03:02:11.720 --> 03:02:19.720]  That guy showed me a document camera, this portal girl here, this was, I mean, look at that little girl
[03:02:19.720 --> 03:02:24.720]  and they're giving her the oral vaccine right there, just absolutely dastardly.
[03:02:24.720 --> 03:02:32.720]  And that's 47,000, but my numbers are 67,000, ended up getting a paralyzed, excuse me, a paralyzed,
[03:02:32.720 --> 03:02:34.720]  some of them dying from it.
[03:02:34.720 --> 03:02:36.720]  I mean, just think of the ultimate evil of that.
[03:02:36.720 --> 03:02:42.720]  You know what, you should, with your evidence, write an article and send it and then we look over it as the evidence.
[03:02:42.720 --> 03:02:46.720]  We'd publish it at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com.
[03:02:46.720 --> 03:02:48.720]  Sure, I would love to work with you anywhere I could, Alex.
[03:02:48.720 --> 03:02:50.720]  Well, no, I mean, I know I've seen, well, thank you, sir.
[03:02:50.720 --> 03:02:52.720]  I've seen some of that research over the years.
[03:02:52.720 --> 03:03:00.720]  I'm saying, re-codify it, send it on over, you know, find that British, it's like the 1750s,
[03:03:00.720 --> 03:03:08.720]  that British officers manual talking about how to kill the natives with the, you know,
[03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:14.720]  get it from men who freshly have the pox, then give it immediately to the savages to kill them, stuff like that.
[03:03:14.720 --> 03:03:17.720]  People need to see all that in context, understand what's happening.
[03:03:17.720 --> 03:03:19.720]  I appreciate you joining us, calling us.
[03:03:19.720 --> 03:03:24.720]  You know, so many listeners out there, you know, this just sounds over the top.
[03:03:24.720 --> 03:03:26.720]  Well, history's over the top.
[03:03:26.720 --> 03:03:32.720]  Rick in California, last caller we have time for, you're on the air, got about a minute and a half.
[03:03:32.720 --> 03:03:34.720]  Alex, it's an honor to talk to you.
[03:03:34.720 --> 03:03:38.720]  Since I got a short time, I'll just get to the most important thing.
[03:03:38.720 --> 03:03:47.720]  I'm a disabled veteran and I just won a decade long war for trying to get 100% disability from them that I was entitled to the whole time.
[03:03:47.720 --> 03:03:53.720]  And this message is for every veteran who's trying to get any benefit at all from the VA.
[03:03:53.720 --> 03:03:59.720]  They have red tape that they're so fond of throwing in our way to try and block us from getting anything.
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:02.720]  They have red tape, they have to jump through too.
[03:04:02.720 --> 03:04:08.720]  And it's called Title 38 of the United States Code of Federal Regulation.
[03:04:08.720 --> 03:04:12.720]  That's right. They always leave themselves backdoors and escape hatches.
[03:04:12.720 --> 03:04:14.720]  They don't ever want you to know.
[03:04:14.720 --> 03:04:22.720]  This whole system is about their exempt, but you see the way law works, you can be exempt from all their evil too if you know the hatches.
[03:04:22.720 --> 03:04:31.720]  Exactly. And if you take the time to sit there and read through there, it will tell you everything that they have to do on your behalf.
[03:04:31.720 --> 03:04:38.720]  And you print that out and you take that into there to them and you say, you go ahead and violate federal law to my face.
[03:04:38.720 --> 03:04:49.720]  And they immediately know that you're aware of what's going on and the mercenary foreign non-doctors, fraud doctors, then they back off and give you the care and move on to exterminating the next person.
[03:04:49.720 --> 03:04:53.720]  Unbelievable. We'll be right back with retransmission.
