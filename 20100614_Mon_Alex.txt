[00:44.680 --> 00:53.480]  we'll get to you in the second half of this first hour in the aftermath of my
[00:53.480 --> 00:58.720]  sitting in the three hours after I finish here we've got a compilation of
[00:58.720 --> 01:02.920]  outstanding interviews which Alex has done over the past couple of weeks
[01:02.920 --> 01:09.760]  including Jesse Ventura and Alan Hart so be sure to stay tuned for that if you
[01:09.760 --> 01:17.160]  missed it the first time around now in anticipation of Chris Matthews and MSNBC
[01:17.160 --> 01:24.320]  airing this huge hit piece on Wednesday night 7 p.m. Eastern time the rise of the
[01:24.320 --> 01:29.920]  new right we're going to take an in-depth look at how while smearing
[01:29.920 --> 01:35.480]  peaceful grassroots American citizens and anti-big government protesters
[01:35.480 --> 01:42.320]  anti bailout protesters as domestic terrorists and racist radicals simply
[01:42.320 --> 01:47.240]  for opposing the growth of big government and being vocal about it and
[01:47.240 --> 01:54.880]  the tyranny that comes with it Matthews has concurrently been running defense
[01:54.880 --> 02:01.840]  for a real domestic terrorist and the man who helped launch Barack Obama
[02:01.840 --> 02:07.120]  Barrisatero's political career in his living room I refer of course to Bill
[02:07.120 --> 02:13.360]  Ayres former leader of the violent communist revolutionary terrorist
[02:13.360 --> 02:18.160]  organization the weather underground a group that carried out bombings against
[02:18.160 --> 02:22.080]  government buildings the State Department the Pentagon the Capitol
[02:22.080 --> 02:27.760]  building to name but three and this demonization of grassroots political
[02:27.760 --> 02:35.720]  activists is while in reality while in the MSNBC and the corporate media are
[02:35.720 --> 02:40.480]  saying that there's this new frontier of hate and that there's this violent
[02:40.480 --> 02:46.240]  extremism that is coming from the quote right-wingers in reality the only
[02:46.240 --> 02:52.440]  violence is coming from zealous Obama supporters the Obama noids and this
[02:52.440 --> 02:56.720]  ties into a big story that's doing the rounds today which comes from big
[02:56.720 --> 03:01.360]  government dot com and we'll be posting this very shortly on prison planet dot
[03:01.360 --> 03:07.720]  com and info wars dot com and this is Democrat congressman Bob
[03:07.720 --> 03:14.760]  Etheridge assaulting students who ask him merely if he supports the Obama agenda
[03:14.760 --> 03:21.240]  after a Nancy Pelosi event at which she was speaking so we'll play this clip now
[03:21.240 --> 03:26.400]  for prison planet TV viewers and radio listeners will be able to hear it too so
[03:26.400 --> 03:30.360]  we go to this clip of Bob Etheridge
[03:30.360 --> 03:39.680]  hi congressman are you
[03:39.680 --> 03:53.200]  do you fully support the Obama agenda for you for you so the clip is the clip
[03:53.200 --> 03:57.360]  continues after that perhaps we'll play the full clip later but it's only a
[03:57.360 --> 04:01.640]  minute long and it's basically this congressman he's walking down the
[04:01.640 --> 04:06.000]  street you'll be able to see it on prison planet dot com the student
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.480]  reporters ask him if he supports the Obama agenda and he immediately starts
[04:11.480 --> 04:15.840]  assaulting them assaulting their camera he actually grabs one of them around the
[04:15.840 --> 04:21.440]  neck and goes into a kind of mini half Nelson on him and then he obviously
[04:21.440 --> 04:26.920]  repeats this moronic zombified statement who are you who are you so it's yet
[04:26.920 --> 04:31.920]  another example of you know while the mainstream media criticizes any opposition
[04:31.920 --> 04:36.240]  to the government as a new frontier of violent extremism the only violence is
[04:36.240 --> 04:41.680]  coming from pro-Obama goons like this congressman and the Obama's own
[04:41.680 --> 04:45.800]  supporters so we'll be back after the break to delve into that further on the
[04:45.800 --> 05:02.400]  Alex Jones show me Paul Joseph Watson stay tuned the fall of America and the

[08:00.720 --> 08:10.360]  ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network this is
[08:10.360 --> 08:15.880]  the Alex Jones show with me your sitting host Paul Joseph Watson while Alex is
[08:15.880 --> 08:21.400]  away working on a project now as we were discussing before the break while Chris
[08:21.400 --> 08:27.520]  Matthews and MSNBC are preparing to smear grassroots Americans as violent
[08:27.520 --> 08:32.480]  radicals with this upcoming hit piece the rise of the new rights which airs on
[08:32.480 --> 08:38.600]  MSNBC this Wednesday at 7 p.m. Eastern time we have a Democratic congressman
[08:38.600 --> 08:43.600]  actually physically assaulting reporters who are merely walking down the
[08:43.600 --> 08:49.560]  street asking this congressman if he supports the Obama agenda now this
[08:49.560 --> 08:55.640]  mirrors what we reported on last week which was at this anti bailout protest
[08:55.640 --> 09:01.080]  in North Carolina where you had this Obamanoid goon descend on the protest
[09:01.080 --> 09:06.160]  and start an argument with the protesters about who was to blame for the
[09:06.160 --> 09:11.320]  financial crisis and of course as those of you who have seen the video will know
[09:11.320 --> 09:18.760]  and YouTube actually scrubbed deleted memory hold the video shortly after we
[09:18.760 --> 09:22.840]  posted that article last week it has since re-emerged but it shows this
[09:22.840 --> 09:30.520]  Obamanoid activists landing a left hook on this anti bailout protester who's
[09:30.520 --> 09:35.120]  protesting against big government so again and we've we've documented many
[09:35.120 --> 09:39.760]  other examples which were in the article while a media is smearing so-called
[09:39.760 --> 09:44.480]  right-wingers which in reality are just grassroots libertarians independence
[09:44.480 --> 09:49.360]  conservatives across the board as dangerous radicals who are a physical
[09:49.360 --> 09:53.920]  threat and their free speech represents a threat to the federal government
[09:53.920 --> 09:58.760]  smearing them as violent radicals and extremists the only violence is coming
[09:58.760 --> 10:03.680]  from these Obamanoids and these Democratic congressmen that so that
[10:03.680 --> 10:10.400]  support Obama's agenda so we've got this hit piece coming up on Wednesday we got
[10:10.400 --> 10:16.560]  the leaked script last week from a concerned MSNBC staffer now just to
[10:16.560 --> 10:21.200]  understand this Alex Jones went into this interview he initially thought he
[10:21.200 --> 10:25.120]  would be interviewed by Chris Matthews but they sent the production team from
[10:25.120 --> 10:30.480]  MSNBC to interview Alex and they gave him their word that this would be a
[10:30.480 --> 10:35.960]  balanced and fair biography of the growth of the anti big government
[10:35.960 --> 10:40.320]  movement and yet we received the transcript we went through it and it
[10:40.320 --> 10:46.280]  became clear that MSNBC once again had resort to exercising the same tired old
[10:46.280 --> 10:51.200]  cliches about how anyone who criticizes the federal government is basically a
[10:51.200 --> 10:57.680]  dangerous radical neo-nazi racist they compare them to these obscure radio
[10:57.680 --> 11:03.920]  hosts in the 30s who support Hitler so they're smearing us as racist radicals
[11:03.920 --> 11:08.600]  who probably want to kill people you had the quote from the Southern Poverty
[11:08.600 --> 11:14.320]  Law Center individual Mark Poltak who said that not Alex Jones let's be fair
[11:14.320 --> 11:20.120]  but Alex Jones's listeners want to go on killing sprees now I've been working
[11:20.120 --> 11:24.080]  for Alex for about eight years and I've never talked to received an email or
[11:24.080 --> 11:28.960]  met an Alex Jones listener who wants to go on a killing spree now you had the
[11:28.960 --> 11:34.520]  Poplowski thing which was a complete smear the Pittsburgh cop killer he
[11:34.520 --> 11:38.240]  actually hated Alex Jones he left messages on our website which we found
[11:38.240 --> 11:43.560]  where he stated that he opposed Alex Jones as peaceful message several
[11:43.560 --> 11:49.480]  publications had to retract that but it's still repeated ad infinitum even
[11:49.480 --> 11:53.080]  though it's been debunked over and over again so we're going to get the same kind
[11:53.080 --> 11:59.560]  of rhetoric with this rise of the new right hit piece that's coming up on
[11:59.560 --> 12:05.440]  Wednesday which is unsurprising given the fact that Matthews and certainly MSNBC
[12:05.440 --> 12:10.080]  as a whole have made a habit out of portraying tea party members second
[12:10.080 --> 12:14.600]  amendment activists and basically anyone who stands up against big government as
[12:14.600 --> 12:21.080]  part of a new frontier of violent extremism but for me and I've been
[12:21.080 --> 12:24.440]  researching this for an article which is going to go up on prisonplanet.com
[12:24.440 --> 12:31.840]  later today Matthews as a gender driven bias is exposed fundamentally with no
[12:31.840 --> 12:38.080]  better a comparison than how he Matthews Chris Matthews during an interview with
[12:38.080 --> 12:42.640]  Bill Ayres the domestic terrorist the leader of the weather underground who
[12:42.640 --> 12:48.520]  bombed government buildings in the 70s basically acted as an apologist for Ayres
[12:48.520 --> 12:55.720]  as terrorist past and indeed found common ground with Ayres in other areas
[12:55.720 --> 13:02.120]  of US government policy both domestic and geopolitical. Now this is important
[13:02.120 --> 13:10.120]  because according to former FBI agent Larry Grathwall who was assigned to
[13:10.120 --> 13:14.560]  infiltrate the weather underground as a double agent he actually infiltrated
[13:14.560 --> 13:19.400]  their central committee where Bill Ayres was giving out the orders he
[13:19.400 --> 13:23.720]  discovered that the weather underground were bombing the Pentagon the State
[13:23.720 --> 13:27.960]  Department and the Capitol Hill building as part of an attempt to cause the
[13:27.960 --> 13:33.120]  collapse of the United States government and open the door for Chinese and
[13:33.120 --> 13:40.280]  Soviet troops and Cuban troops to occupy the country and set up a communist
[13:40.280 --> 13:46.560]  dictatorship. Now this is admitted by Grathwall in his testimony and he states
[13:46.560 --> 13:51.960]  in this clip that will play in a second that Bill Ayres who was the leader of the
[13:51.960 --> 13:56.320]  weather underground stated that Americans who would try to resist this
[13:56.320 --> 14:02.520]  communist takeover would be taken to quote re-education centers in the
[14:02.520 --> 14:08.360]  Southwest and asked what you would do with those Americans who still refuse
[14:08.360 --> 14:14.280]  to convert to this communist revolution according to Grathwall the FBI agent
[14:14.280 --> 14:19.160]  Bill Ayres said that they would be eliminated and he went on to say that
[14:19.160 --> 14:24.120]  25 million Americans who they would take to these concentration camps these
[14:24.120 --> 14:30.960]  re-education centers would be killed and this is a guy that Chris Matthews has
[14:30.960 --> 14:35.360]  defended publicly during an interview and in the aftermath of that interview as
[14:35.360 --> 14:42.560]  we shall see and it's a guy who also launched the political career of Barack
[14:42.560 --> 14:49.000]  Obama in his living room this is Bill Ayres the domestic terrorist who bombed
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.360]  the Pentagon who bombed the State Department and the Capitol building in
[14:53.360 --> 14:59.240]  Washington. Now in this clip Grathwall the FBI agent also points out that most
[14:59.240 --> 15:03.520]  of the people advocating this brutality this slaughter of 25 million
[15:03.520 --> 15:09.240]  Americans had graduate degrees from Columbia a well-known education
[15:09.240 --> 15:15.240]  centers and this ties into the fact that after his terrorist past Ayres went on
[15:15.240 --> 15:20.680]  to become an influential key figure in the development of Barack Obama's
[15:20.680 --> 15:25.480]  political career and also a key figure in the American educational establishment
[15:25.480 --> 15:31.840]  as he is now a professor at Illinois University so let's play this FBI agent
[15:31.840 --> 15:36.160]  Grathwall describing what the goals were of Bill Ayres and the weather
[15:36.160 --> 15:41.200]  underground let's play the clip. I brought up the subject of what's going to
[15:41.200 --> 15:45.760]  happen after we take over the government you know we we become
[15:45.760 --> 15:53.360]  responsible then for administrating you know 250 million people and there was no
[15:53.360 --> 15:59.400]  answers no one had given any thought to economics how are you gonna close and
[15:59.400 --> 16:04.200]  feed these people the only thing that I could get was that they expected that
[16:04.200 --> 16:08.560]  the Cubans and the North Vietnamese and the Chinese and the Russians would all
[16:08.560 --> 16:14.040]  want to occupy different portions of the United States they also believed that
[16:14.040 --> 16:17.640]  their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called the
[16:17.640 --> 16:24.080]  counter-revolution and they felt that this counter-revolution could best be
[16:24.080 --> 16:29.240]  guarded against by creating and establishing reeducation centers in
[16:29.240 --> 16:35.480]  the Southwest where we would take all the people who needed to be reeducated
[16:35.480 --> 16:42.800]  into the new way of thinking and teach them how things were going to be I ask
[16:42.800 --> 16:46.960]  well what is going to happen to those people that we can't reeducate that
[16:46.960 --> 16:53.400]  are diehard capitalists and the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated and
[16:53.400 --> 16:57.440]  when I pursued this further they estimated that they would have to
[16:57.440 --> 17:03.040]  eliminate 25 million people in these reeducation centers and when I say
[17:03.040 --> 17:09.760]  eliminate I mean kill 25 million people I want you to imagine sitting in a room
[17:09.760 --> 17:18.800]  with 25 people most of which have graduate degrees from Columbia and other
[17:18.800 --> 17:26.720]  well-known educational centers and hear them figuring out the logistics for the
[17:26.720 --> 17:33.200]  elimination of 25 million people and they were dead serious so that's Larry
[17:33.200 --> 17:38.800]  Grathwall former FBI agent who was a task to infiltrate Bill Ayers weather
[17:38.800 --> 17:44.960]  underground organization saying that if the communist revolution was to be
[17:44.960 --> 17:49.840]  successful that they would allow Soviet and Russian troops to steam in and any
[17:49.840 --> 17:53.640]  Americans who tried to resist this new tyranny would be taken to quote
[17:53.640 --> 17:58.560]  reeducation centers and if they further resisted to convert to the communist
[17:58.560 --> 18:04.080]  revolution they would be quote eliminated now this is coming from a guy
[18:04.080 --> 18:10.000]  Bill Ayers who bombed the Pentagon and the State Department and Capitol Hill
[18:10.000 --> 18:15.800]  building who Chris Matthews threw softball questions at and found common
[18:15.800 --> 18:20.760]  ground with he's a domestic terrorist and yet Matthews in this new hit piece
[18:20.760 --> 18:25.440]  coming up on Wednesday says that it's the grassroots American people who are
[18:25.440 --> 18:30.600]  the real violent threat now the most disturbing aspect of what you just heard
[18:30.600 --> 18:35.640]  from Grathwall was not the likelihood that the weather underground could have
[18:35.640 --> 18:39.200]  achieved this communist revolution which was obviously never going to be
[18:39.200 --> 18:44.200]  successful it's the fact that the man who expressed these intentions to eliminate
[18:44.200 --> 18:50.640]  25 million Americans who would resist this takeover went on to become an
[18:50.640 --> 18:56.960]  influential elitist within American educational circles and also came to the
[18:56.960 --> 19:02.960]  aid and directly influenced and launched indeed Barack Obama's political
[19:02.960 --> 19:09.480]  career from his own living room now while Matthews savages anti-big government
[19:09.480 --> 19:14.840]  activists as representing this dangerous threat he portrays Ayers as you know
[19:14.840 --> 19:21.000]  this reasonable progressive and reformed individual you can go on YouTube and
[19:21.000 --> 19:25.160]  search for Bill Ayers Chris Matthews and we're not going to play it because it's

[24:16.520 --> 24:21.240]  Paul Joseph Watson we'll be taking your calls after the bottom of the hour the
[24:21.240 --> 24:31.240]  number is 888-201-2244 that's 888-201-2244 so get lined up on the boards
[24:31.240 --> 24:36.000]  and we'll discuss what we've been covering before the break which is the
[24:36.000 --> 24:41.640]  fact that MSNBC are readying this huge hit piece the rise of the new right
[24:41.640 --> 24:46.800]  against grassroots American political activists while Chris Matthews himself
[24:46.800 --> 24:52.880]  in MSNBC are throwing softball questions to and finding common ground
[24:52.880 --> 24:58.000]  with real domestic terrorists like the former weather underground leader Bill
[24:58.000 --> 25:04.320]  Ayers who as we played from the FBI agent before the break planned to allow
[25:04.320 --> 25:10.440]  the invasion of America by these Soviet and Chinese troops and the setup of
[25:10.440 --> 25:15.000]  vast gulags whereby Americans who disagreed with this would be quote
[25:15.000 --> 25:21.200]  reeducated or if not killed now this is a the ultimate example of a domestic
[25:21.200 --> 25:26.440]  terrorist and extremist and yet he's been given cover and Chris Matthews is
[25:26.440 --> 25:31.080]  running defense for him while smearing us as the real violent radicals it's the
[25:31.080 --> 25:36.400]  height of hypocrisy and it just exposes their agenda-driven bias for what it is
[25:36.400 --> 25:43.800]  now after Chris Matthews interviewed Bill Ayers which took place in October
[25:43.800 --> 25:51.480]  2008 after this controversy of Ayers links with Obama had surfaced he again
[25:51.480 --> 25:56.320]  ran defense for the domestic terrorist Bill Ayers during an interview with Pat
[25:56.320 --> 26:01.880]  Buchanan when Buchanan raised Ayers comments to the New York Times in
[26:01.880 --> 26:08.040]  September 2001 when Ayers said quote I don't regret setting bombs and I feel
[26:08.040 --> 26:13.360]  we didn't do enough and then if he was asked if he'd do it all again and Ayers
[26:13.360 --> 26:18.640]  responded quote I don't want to discount the possibility so this what this is a
[26:18.640 --> 26:23.720]  man who not only planned and executed bombings against government buildings
[26:23.720 --> 26:29.040]  in the 70s but decades later he expresses no remorse whatsoever and even
[26:29.040 --> 26:33.160]  indicates that he would be willing to do it again and this is a man who has been
[26:33.160 --> 26:38.280]  defended and who has found common ground with Chris Matthews during his
[26:38.280 --> 26:44.320]  interview with Matthews on MSNBC now I mean it comes as no surprise that Matthews
[26:44.320 --> 26:50.240]  is cozying up to this communist revolutionary Ayers because Matthews
[26:50.240 --> 26:58.160]  himself once named one of his heroes as the communist ideologue Saul Elinsky and
[26:58.160 --> 27:05.840]  also recall during a segment with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC Matthews also let slip
[27:05.840 --> 27:11.360]  the fact that he analyzes politics from a Marxist perspective and we've got that
[27:11.360 --> 27:16.480]  clip so we go to that clip now no people it I'm Marxist when it comes to
[27:16.480 --> 27:21.760]  analysis people judge their current economic circumstances and then they
[27:21.760 --> 27:24.520]  make political judgment this is one of those nights though when we can be
[27:24.520 --> 27:28.840]  absolute purists in terms of extrapolating from this one race because
[27:28.840 --> 27:33.960]  there was only so they have Chris Matthews saying quote I'm Marxist when
[27:33.960 --> 27:39.480]  it comes to analysis so he's admitting to analyzing politics from a Marxist
[27:39.480 --> 27:44.680]  perspective now what do we do here at the Alex Jones show we analyze politics
[27:44.680 --> 27:49.600]  from a constitutionalist throat libertarian perspective why because
[27:49.600 --> 27:54.800]  we're constitutionalist throat libertarians now if Matthews is admitting
[27:54.800 --> 27:58.920]  the analyzers politics from a Marxist perspective then what does that make him
[27:58.920 --> 28:04.920]  it makes him a Marxist and this was only emphasized by another segment on his
[28:04.920 --> 28:10.840]  MSNBC show which he had several months ago whereby he had these guests on from
[28:10.840 --> 28:15.640]  Politico and these other organizations and Matthews and his guests basically
[28:15.640 --> 28:20.760]  implied that anyone who is skeptical of or expresses disdain or distrust towards
[28:20.760 --> 28:26.600]  government is psychologically insane now where does this come from it comes from
[28:26.600 --> 28:32.920]  the Soviet mental asylums which were used by the Soviets by the communists to
[28:32.920 --> 28:38.240]  isolate political prisoners by categorizing their distrust of the state
[28:38.240 --> 28:43.720]  as a psychological illness and it's similar to what happens today in North
[28:43.720 --> 28:49.080]  Korea with Kim Jong-il where 200 million people are held in gulags because
[28:49.080 --> 28:53.720]  they've expressed distrust of the government even to just a mild extent
[28:53.720 --> 28:58.120]  so this is what Matthews was advocating during this debate where he said that
[28:58.120 --> 29:02.360]  people who distrust government are psychologically insane is it any wonder
[29:02.360 --> 29:07.040]  that this is a guy who's defended somebody who once called for giant
[29:07.040 --> 29:14.960]  communist reeducation camps in America and as I said before the notion that
[29:14.960 --> 29:19.160]  heirs is merely this reasonable rational individual is completely
[29:19.160 --> 29:24.280]  contradicted by the fact that he still advocates these kind of methods and he's
[29:24.280 --> 29:28.960]  unrepentant for his bombings against government buildings now we'll continue
[29:28.960 --> 29:34.640]  to explore heirs ties to Obama himself after the break this is the Alex Jones

[31:23.400 --> 31:27.720]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[31:27.720 --> 31:32.000]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every

[33:22.400 --> 33:26.280]  we're talking about Bill Ayres the domestic terrorist weather underground
[33:26.280 --> 33:31.500]  founder who was defended by Chris Matthews who is preparing to smear grass
[33:31.500 --> 33:35.720]  roots Americans as violent radicals and domestic terrorists with this new hit
[33:35.720 --> 33:42.520]  piece coming up on Wednesday now I went into this whole Bill Ayres Obama thing
[33:42.520 --> 33:47.920]  thinking that it was just a political talking point that was exaggerated by
[33:47.920 --> 33:53.800]  the McCain pale in campaign in 2008 I didn't even pay much heed to it at the
[33:53.800 --> 33:59.400]  time but I was up until about 2 a.m. last night researching it and it turns
[33:59.400 --> 34:06.040]  out that it indeed is true that Barack Obama's political career was launched
[34:06.040 --> 34:11.800]  in the living room of Bill Ayres this domestic terrorist communist revolutionary
[34:11.800 --> 34:17.520]  and this in fact was admitted to it was not only reported in the political it was
[34:17.520 --> 34:22.520]  admitted to by Maria Warren who was a liberal political activist who attended
[34:22.520 --> 34:28.240]  this infamous Ayres Obama function who stated quite plainly quote when I first
[34:28.240 --> 34:33.520]  met Barack Obama he was giving a talk in the living room of those two legends in
[34:33.520 --> 34:37.720]  their own minds Bill Ayres and Bernardine Dawn they were launching him
[34:37.720 --> 34:42.320]  introducing him to the Hyde Park community as the best things in sliced
[34:42.320 --> 34:48.240]  bread so this is the guy who bombed government buildings the communist
[34:48.240 --> 34:53.840]  revolutionary Bill Ayres who helped to launch Barack Obama's political career
[34:53.840 --> 34:58.440]  back in 1995 and it's not just the fact that they sat on the same board of this
[34:58.440 --> 35:04.320]  educational organization the depth of Ayres relationship with Obama is
[35:04.320 --> 35:10.480]  revealed by the startling revelations that were uncovered by the journalist
[35:10.480 --> 35:18.440]  the writer Jack Cashill of Obama's book Obama's 1995 memoir dreams from my
[35:18.440 --> 35:24.000]  father now cashill has written over a dozen articles which prove and this was
[35:24.000 --> 35:29.000]  later backed up and verified by another author called Christopher Anderson that
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.920]  the terrorist Bill Ayres the communist revolutionary you wanted to kill 25
[35:33.920 --> 35:38.680]  million Americans according to FBI agent Larry Grathwell significantly
[35:38.680 --> 35:46.920]  contributed and even wrote significant parts of Obama's 1995 book now in
[35:46.920 --> 35:53.320]  reality the implications of Obama's ties with Ayres bearing in mind is history
[35:53.320 --> 35:59.320]  which Chris Matthews has defended soft peddled ignored a frightening and they
[35:59.320 --> 36:05.120]  go beyond what I'm talking about today which is MSNBC's hypocrisy but to
[36:05.120 --> 36:10.440]  research the connection between Ayres and Obama and what Ayres advocated really
[36:10.440 --> 36:15.920]  strikes at the root of the trouble we're in and in particular how Barack Obama
[36:15.920 --> 36:21.120]  Barry Citero is a completely hollow sock puppet whose strings are being pulled
[36:21.120 --> 36:28.320]  by the most violent extremists in the elite that are inside America remember
[36:28.320 --> 36:32.520]  that Bill Ayres is now a prominent educational establishment member he
[36:32.520 --> 36:38.920]  sits he's got a professorship with the University of Illinois so in summary
[36:38.920 --> 36:44.360]  while Matthews is preparing to smear peaceful American activists as domestic
[36:44.360 --> 36:50.000]  terrorists he's actually running defense for a real domestic terrorist who
[36:50.000 --> 36:55.400]  masterminded bombings in America and somebody who went on to become an
[36:55.400 --> 37:00.800]  influential figure in steering Barack Obama's path to the White House that's
[37:00.800 --> 37:08.280]  a fundamentally frightening story but it's also shows how much hypocrisy Matthews
[37:08.280 --> 37:12.880]  is engaging in when he says that people like Alex Jones are the violent radicals
[37:12.880 --> 37:17.680]  when he's running defense and agreeing and finding common ground with real
[37:17.680 --> 37:22.080]  violent radicals who carried out bombings like whether underground found a
[37:22.080 --> 37:26.680]  Bill Ayres so I want to hear what you've got to say about this we'll also cover
[37:26.680 --> 37:30.600]  the other news if you wish about BP the oil spill the developments there and
[37:30.600 --> 37:35.760]  whatever else is on your mind so we're gonna go to our first caller now which

[37:40.880 --> 37:45.120]  just wondering what do you what do you see all this heading as far as with with
[37:45.120 --> 37:50.280]  the the documentary whatever you want to call it's about to be released without
[37:50.280 --> 37:55.040]  on Alex Jones and all this what they're trying to build up against you know
[37:55.040 --> 37:58.960]  right wingers and things like that what do you think that's headed if that makes
[37:58.960 --> 38:04.760]  any sense yeah I think it's clearly heading towards an attempt to shut down
[38:04.760 --> 38:09.480]  free speech not only in terms of internet censorship which we already see in
[38:09.480 --> 38:14.280]  developed nations like Australia where they are now filtering websites which
[38:14.280 --> 38:20.080]  are deemed quote offensive now this is not China this is not North Korea right
[38:20.080 --> 38:23.760]  or anywhere like that it's in Australia and there are efforts to push that
[38:23.760 --> 38:27.480]  through both in the UK which is already happening and in America so they're
[38:27.480 --> 38:32.600]  gonna try and block out our websites you've heard the Federal Communications
[38:32.600 --> 38:37.600]  Commission going after talk radio and also independent websites like drudge
[38:37.600 --> 38:42.040]  report with this so-called drudge tax which is also a way of trying to
[38:42.040 --> 38:48.720]  financially eradicate independent bloggers and independent political news
[38:48.720 --> 38:54.560]  websites and now if they demonize our free speech as violent radicalism and
[38:54.560 --> 39:00.520]  certainly if they if events transpire which are carried out by people
[39:00.520 --> 39:04.880]  supposedly forwarding this violent extremism which we've warned against
[39:04.880 --> 39:11.160]  then that will be the pretext for increased censorship of not only the
[39:11.160 --> 39:21.120]  tea party but basically anyone who opposes big government in an off-subject
[39:21.120 --> 39:25.080]  kind of question I've seen on the news did you see that they're trying to push
[39:25.080 --> 39:32.680]  predator drones in US airspace yeah I saw that and it clearly states that
[39:32.680 --> 39:37.640]  they're going to push to use them for a law enforcement in America and this is
[39:37.640 --> 39:41.800]  not just going to be on the border where people want to see them introduced for
[39:41.800 --> 39:47.000]  obvious reasons but this is going to be predator drones flying around inside the
[39:47.000 --> 39:52.280]  United States not only spying on people but eventually they're talking about
[39:52.280 --> 39:57.360]  them being armed as well so this is a massive advancement of the police state
[39:57.360 --> 40:01.760]  and it's basically saying that America is now no different from Iraq or
[40:01.760 --> 40:05.880]  Afghanistan where this where the so-called quote insurgents going to be
[40:05.880 --> 40:10.440]  targeted by these predator drones which are going to be armed with weapons as
[40:10.440 --> 40:14.880]  well as spy capabilities so yeah that was in the associated press this morning
[40:14.880 --> 40:19.840]  that they're now getting ready to introduce predator drones inside the
[40:19.840 --> 40:24.800]  United States for a law enforcement which shows yet another advancement of
[40:24.800 --> 40:29.960]  this police state that's strangling us thanks for the call mark we're going to
[40:29.960 --> 40:35.600]  go to Colby in New Hampshire Colby you're on the air hey Paul this is a his
[40:35.600 --> 40:41.360]  Colby I was opening up my inbox this morning and I got a message from Blizzard
[40:41.360 --> 40:47.600]  the creators of the World of Warcraft series and apparently they're
[40:47.600 --> 40:53.760]  integrating a real ID security system into the game and I thought this is an
[40:53.760 --> 40:59.400]  interesting development because as of 2008 there was 11.5 million people playing
[40:59.400 --> 41:07.480]  that game and you know that's kind of a frightening personal security preach in
[41:07.480 --> 41:13.560]  my opinion going in that direction yeah it's it's being reported by the web
[41:13.560 --> 41:20.320]  by rittengott.com World of Warcraft real ID incoming and the article says if
[41:20.320 --> 41:24.480]  you're one of the 11.5 million World of Warcraft players you should be excited
[41:24.480 --> 41:28.640]  to learn that Blizzard is implementing a new friends list management system
[41:28.640 --> 41:34.800]  dubbed real ID which claims to increase the level of interaction players have
[41:34.800 --> 41:39.560]  with each other now do you know anything about exactly what users will be
[41:39.560 --> 41:45.240]  required to do as part of this real ID system is it a kind of individual
[41:45.240 --> 41:51.560]  identification system it certainly seems like that I haven't seen specific
[41:51.560 --> 41:56.040]  biometrics or anything like that but it seems like it's a further way to kind
[41:56.040 --> 42:01.640]  of tie in the internet 2.0 theory of identifying everyone individually and
[42:01.640 --> 42:05.520]  ensuring that whatever they've done is they've done is tracked to their
[42:05.520 --> 42:11.920]  personal ID. Right yeah it's kind of like how the Chinese wanted to
[42:11.920 --> 42:17.000]  individually identify bloggers by each giving them an ID number which they
[42:17.000 --> 42:21.280]  would be required to obtain before they could write anything on the internet and
[42:21.280 --> 42:27.280]  it's part of this increasing move towards identification of individuals
[42:27.280 --> 42:34.080]  taking away the anonymous aspect of the internet which many people exercise as a
[42:34.080 --> 42:39.280]  tool for their free speech so yeah we'll definitely keep track of this and
[42:39.280 --> 42:44.440]  we'll be posting it on the website later today that's very interesting story we
[42:44.440 --> 42:48.640]  go to our next caller now and it's Ronnie in Texas Ronnie what's on your mind
[42:48.640 --> 42:53.400]  today thank you sir I just wanted to share with you that in Chicago while
[42:53.400 --> 42:58.800]  attending a pre Ralph Nader Green party grant gathering when I was in the back
[42:58.800 --> 43:04.400]  then an open Steve Forbes tax reform enthusiast I was informed that the
[43:04.400 --> 43:10.240]  greens were actually the front for the communists and the labor unions who are
[43:10.240 --> 43:14.440]  running this leftist leaning third party movement they were hijacking the greens
[43:14.440 --> 43:17.920]  you know the environmental movement was just completely hijacked by these
[43:17.920 --> 43:21.600]  communists and then while trying to break through the back here in Texas
[43:21.600 --> 43:26.560]  through the into the Libertarian Party I discovered the same criminal control of
[43:26.560 --> 43:30.840]  the Texas Libertarian Party refusing to talk this is the Libertarian Party and
[43:30.840 --> 43:35.200]  they refuse to talk about the war on pot smokers medicinal marijuana supporting
[43:35.200 --> 43:39.120]  our troops with freedom for farmers you know that the medicinal marijuana really
[43:39.120 --> 43:43.040]  helps traumatic brain-injured people and I can personally give you a testimony
[43:43.040 --> 43:46.640]  on that and and that's some of this information I was trying to share and
[43:46.640 --> 43:50.880]  and run as a candidate and everything and influence their leaning but but it's
[43:50.880 --> 43:54.160]  completely controlled the third party movement here in Texas is just
[43:54.160 --> 43:59.560]  completely controlled by either the out now communists in the greens or the so
[43:59.560 --> 44:03.680]  called Libertarians and the guy who ran the show here and now in in Travis
[44:03.680 --> 44:07.720]  County is now the national leader of the Libertarian Party so they're just
[44:07.720 --> 44:13.360]  completely stained with with criminality and refusal to face the real
[44:13.360 --> 44:17.720]  problems and real solutions that is you know freedom for farmers is a great
[44:17.720 --> 44:21.720]  solution to a whole lot of problems of family farms you know conserving
[44:21.720 --> 44:25.480]  topsoil they'll feed our future getting out of wars these idiotic wars if we
[44:25.480 --> 44:29.480]  just come to grips with freedom for farmers you know around the world we
[44:29.480 --> 44:36.360]  we make a whole lot of progress yeah well the point you raise about the
[44:36.360 --> 44:41.480]  greens actually now being quite blasé the communists that was actually
[44:41.480 --> 44:47.160]  admitted by the Greenpeace founder Patrick Moore who resigned from Greenpeace
[44:47.160 --> 44:52.360]  partly in protest that the people who had now taken over the organization were
[44:52.360 --> 44:57.880]  not really interested in environmental protection they were more interested in
[44:57.880 --> 45:04.960]  advancing this communist feudalist agenda which as we have exposed vehemently
[45:04.960 --> 45:10.120]  over the past several years is exclusively centered around eviscerating
[45:10.120 --> 45:14.360]  the middle class imposing this post industrial revolution and turning us
[45:14.360 --> 45:19.000]  back into serfs so definitely I mean the modern environment this movement is
[45:19.000 --> 45:22.880]  nothing more than a watermelon it's green on the outside it's red on the
[45:22.880 --> 45:27.160]  inside and that these kind of control freaks will dress themselves in any
[45:27.160 --> 45:31.920]  political ideology that suits them at their present time to further their
[45:31.920 --> 45:35.760]  brutal and tyrannical agenda and that's what we've seen with the greens
[45:35.760 --> 45:42.080]  advancing this current green fascism but thanks for your call Ronnie we're gonna
[45:42.080 --> 45:49.960]  go to John in Ohio John what's on your mind today yes I've supported Alex Jones
[45:49.960 --> 45:54.640]  though I'm on the left and against any claims that he was for violence and the
[45:54.640 --> 46:01.320]  rest of it but I find at this point that what I I see as a fascist element from
[46:01.320 --> 46:04.400]  the John Birch Society this kind of red-baiting because I'm very familiar
[46:04.400 --> 46:11.440]  back in the 60s with the Bill Ayers faction of SDS it was rapidly anti-
[46:11.440 --> 46:17.760]  communist the communist faction was in SDS progressive labor party had about
[46:17.760 --> 46:23.880]  the position that Ayers and these others were totally agent provocateurs that
[46:23.880 --> 46:27.560]  they were trying to discredit the anti-war movement the progressive labor
[46:27.560 --> 46:33.800]  party was the communist faction with an SDS it agreed with you that this
[46:33.800 --> 46:41.040]  deindustrialization was up really up front for this fake liberals within the
[46:41.040 --> 46:46.880]  within the movement I found out that the John Birch Society which is very
[46:46.880 --> 46:50.920]  influential with Alex Jones you know specialized in these kinds of fact
[46:50.920 --> 46:56.960]  outrageous fabrications of a so-called FBI agents that would scare a monger
[46:56.960 --> 47:01.200]  about the Russians and the Chinese and the Cubans invading the United States
[47:01.200 --> 47:08.080]  just fantastical nightmare type of fabrications that were actually up run
[47:08.080 --> 47:12.280]  by Western goals which was connected with the John Birch Society and
[47:12.280 --> 47:18.240]  collaborated with police squads to frame up people around the country even
[47:18.240 --> 47:21.680]  J. Edgar Hoover who was a specialist in this kind of smear job with his
[47:21.680 --> 47:26.000]  Cointel pro said these guys were absolutely discrediting his ability
[47:26.000 --> 47:30.520]  to discredit people because they were so far off the edge of the world for you to
[47:30.520 --> 47:35.360]  quote this so-called FBI agent saying that Russia and China and Cuba were
[47:35.360 --> 47:39.560]  going to invade the country even though there was a Russia China China split I
[47:39.560 --> 47:45.360]  think I've really destroys your credibility and places you in the and
[47:45.360 --> 47:50.240]  that totally discredited down the corner of the John Birch Society which I find
[47:50.240 --> 47:55.120]  too often influences Alex Jones who I've supported even though I disagree with
[47:55.120 --> 48:03.520]  his positions on a limit programs okay thanks for the call yeah I'll respond
[48:03.520 --> 48:08.680]  basically what Gretzwald was saying in that clip was that he asked Bill Ayers
[48:08.680 --> 48:14.000]  and the weather underground what would replace the collapse of the American
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.880]  government if a vacuum was to exist he basically said that the weather
[48:18.880 --> 48:25.520]  underground didn't have any plan for the economic the societal the governmental
[48:25.520 --> 48:31.120]  restoration of a new government under their ideology so that's why they said
[48:31.120 --> 48:36.360]  that they just let the Soviets or the Cubans or the Chinese coming now I
[48:36.360 --> 48:42.320]  agree with your point that Ayers himself was never this big anti-establishment
[48:42.320 --> 48:47.920]  figure which is why in fact he was hired and he became part of the political
[48:47.920 --> 48:52.640]  elite when he became an Illinois professor and this big educational
[48:52.640 --> 48:58.640]  establishment figure in America so the elite certainly used Ayers for their own
[48:58.640 --> 49:05.440]  ends and to create this big idea of the Reds under the bed which led to a lot of
[49:05.440 --> 49:09.760]  Americans giving up their rights and indeed was the start of this military
[49:09.760 --> 49:14.360]  industrial complex movement in the fifties now as I stated earlier in the
[49:14.360 --> 49:20.120]  show I'm not saying that Ayers or the weather underground even plausibly would
[49:20.120 --> 49:24.800]  have been able to cause the collapse of America which would lead to this
[49:24.800 --> 49:29.480]  communist invasion I'm saying that that was their ideology and the fact that
[49:29.480 --> 49:34.120]  Chris Matthews defends it while attacking grassroots Americans as
[49:34.120 --> 49:39.560]  political extremists is the height of hypocrisy so it's not a question of
[49:39.560 --> 49:46.240]  whether Bill Ayers or the communist left wingers at the time really intended to
[49:46.240 --> 49:50.360]  or had a chance of bringing in this communist revolution it's the fact
[49:50.360 --> 49:56.120]  that Chris Matthews now gives them softball questions and basically doesn't
[49:56.120 --> 50:00.920]  even grill them on the fact that they supposedly wanted to bring Americans
[50:00.920 --> 50:06.520]  into reeducation centers and kill them all so I mean why he cannot demonize
[50:06.520 --> 50:11.280]  American citizens as violent radicals while giving aid and comfort to people
[50:11.280 --> 50:14.680]  like Bill Ayers and it's the fact that Bill Ayers was influential in starting
[50:14.680 --> 50:19.200]  Barack Obama's political career that's on the record thanks for the call now
[50:19.200 --> 50:24.040]  we're going to Larry in Louisiana Larry you are on the air hi Paul can you hear
[50:24.040 --> 50:30.720]  me yeah go ahead okay good they had a war in a place they call the colonies
[50:30.720 --> 50:37.080]  here and against what they said was the crown now they teach the children they
[50:37.080 --> 50:41.960]  call the American children that they won this revolutionary war what do they
[50:41.960 --> 50:49.760]  teach the children in England Britain about who won that war I'll answer that
[50:49.760 --> 50:54.080]  after the break Larry we're coming up now on a break and we'll be back in a
[50:54.080 --> 50:57.640]  couple of minutes this is the Alex Jones show we're gonna squeeze in more of
[50:57.640 --> 51:02.320]  your calls after the break so stay tuned this is Alex Jones with five good
[51:02.320 --> 51:06.320]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[51:06.320 --> 51:10.120]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[51:10.120 --> 51:14.200]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[51:14.200 --> 51:18.440]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[51:18.440 --> 51:22.720]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[51:22.720 --> 51:26.680]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[51:26.680 --> 51:31.040]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[51:31.040 --> 51:34.800]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[51:34.800 --> 51:38.920]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[51:38.920 --> 51:42.520]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the
[51:42.520 --> 51:45.640]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old
[51:45.640 --> 51:51.120]  sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my
[51:51.120 --> 51:55.320]  solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my
[51:55.320 --> 52:02.880]  solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 the question is where should the
[52:02.880 --> 52:08.120]  American people draw their line in the sand what have we got a republic or a
[52:08.120 --> 52:12.560]  monarchy a republic is based on a constitution which protects minority
[52:12.560 --> 52:16.800]  rights not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for
[52:16.800 --> 52:20.640]  dinner so they think they own our land they think they're on our water children
[52:20.640 --> 52:25.760]  our education our money we have to define who we are and what we will
[52:25.760 --> 52:30.480]  tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising
[52:30.480 --> 52:34.600]  we have the facts we have the Constitution we have the Bill of
[52:34.600 --> 52:38.680]  Rights we have common law knowledge is power ladies and gentlemen and I'm so

[54:05.160 --> 54:10.560]  final segment of first hour of the Alex Jones show this is Paul Joseph Watson
[54:10.560 --> 54:14.680]  sitting in for Alex we had a caller before the break asking how the American
[54:14.680 --> 54:19.400]  Revolution was taught to British children in British schools from my
[54:19.400 --> 54:24.440]  experience the American Revolution is not taught up until high school certainly
[54:24.440 --> 54:29.400]  the course as I took at university you know college level there was no option
[54:29.400 --> 54:34.000]  to study the American Revolution basically it's completely ignored the
[54:34.000 --> 54:39.400]  reason I left university eventually was because they were teaching the fact that
[54:39.400 --> 54:43.080]  Lenin and Stalin were basically brilliant and everything they did was
[54:43.080 --> 54:49.480]  saintly so that was a good reason to leave what concerns me as is seen in
[54:49.480 --> 54:53.720]  Alex's video the road to tyranny is the fact that FEMA now teaches law
[54:53.720 --> 54:58.120]  enforcement personnel that the founding fathers were terrorists and this ties
[54:58.120 --> 55:03.160]  into the Mayak report and how anyone who believes that the Constitution isn't
[55:03.160 --> 55:09.120]  being followed as Chris Matthews also smears us are violent radicals so we're
[55:09.120 --> 55:15.240]  gonna go to the next call now which is Miguel in New York you are on the air
[55:15.240 --> 55:24.440]  yeah go ahead okay what's in your mind what what is what are we gonna do after
[55:24.440 --> 55:29.520]  they take down the internet because you know I have my friend calls the website
[55:29.520 --> 55:33.640]  and you know we don't we're not conspiracy theories we just cover the facts
[55:33.640 --> 55:37.400]  we just cover the facts that lead it out so what are you gonna do with implement
[55:37.400 --> 55:45.600]  internet to well basically left they're gonna first bring it in by censoring
[55:45.600 --> 55:49.280]  websites they're not gonna bring down the entire internet they're just gonna
[55:49.280 --> 55:55.480]  try and require people to get a license to operate a website and if it comes to
[55:55.480 --> 55:59.360]  that we're just gonna have to go back to the old-fashioned methods you know
[55:59.360 --> 56:04.000]  there's a call in line for people to listen to the Alex Jones show will
[56:04.000 --> 56:08.160]  still be on conventional radio if they don't shut that down and it's basically
[56:08.160 --> 56:13.280]  gonna go back to the days of pamphleteering and magazines and newsletters I
[56:13.280 --> 56:18.080]  guess but I don't see them getting that through there'll be a massive resistance
[56:18.080 --> 56:23.080]  against it and the way things are going they have no momentum with which to push
[56:23.080 --> 56:26.800]  it through thanks for the call we're gonna move quicks we're nearing the end of
[56:26.800 --> 56:34.680]  the hour and it's Janice in Texas Janice you're on the air hi Paul I've we
[56:34.680 --> 56:40.680]  moved to the central Texas like in the middle of the hill country and I look
[56:40.680 --> 56:44.680]  after my mom who's like oh there we're seeing these things in the sky and we
[56:44.680 --> 56:50.080]  thought they were like UFOs you know whatever and they're they're not and I
[56:50.080 --> 56:56.280]  was just let me finish here I was at the gas station as and I saw this guy that
[56:56.280 --> 57:00.200]  was filling up all these gas tanks in this weird travel truck and it said
[57:00.200 --> 57:04.880]  travel search and I was like what on earth sort of vehicle is that and I
[57:04.880 --> 57:08.200]  asked him I said well you know what do you what's travel search what do you do
[57:08.200 --> 57:13.200]  and he said he said oh we look for people and I said you look for people and
[57:13.200 --> 57:18.160]  he said yeah and I said what do you mean and he said we what run drones there are
[57:18.160 --> 57:24.400]  drones that they're all over Texas I mean they're they're out every night I'm
[57:24.400 --> 57:28.240]  just call I mean I'm scared to death to even call because I see him outside and
[57:28.240 --> 57:33.680]  I'm just saying it didn't come in it's here no you're right I mean there's no
[57:33.680 --> 57:39.920]  doubt that drones for law enforcement are already being practiced and indeed
[57:39.920 --> 57:45.080]  used in major American cities indeed today as we discussed earlier it was
[57:45.080 --> 57:49.440]  announced that predator drones would be used for law enforcement so there's no
[57:49.440 --> 57:53.920]  debate as to whether that's happening and that they're preparing for it and it's
[57:53.920 --> 57:58.720]  going to be the next phase of this surveillance process against the American
[57:58.720 --> 58:04.080]  people which is almost exclusively circled around making people afraid
[58:04.080 --> 58:08.280]  making people scared so that they're scared to even speak out in the first
[58:08.280 --> 58:13.320]  place so you just have to get past the fear and go ahead and exercise your
[58:13.320 --> 58:18.520]  freedoms anyway because if you do so then the only step they can then take to
[58:18.520 --> 58:22.960]  stop that is you know by incarceration and that will then expose them as the
[58:22.960 --> 58:27.160]  tyrants that they are thanks they're called Janice and we're going to go to

[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:11.160]  well we normally twist his arm to save him longer than an hour we can't do that
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:15.280]  today because this is the last hour of the radio broadcast we're always honored
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:19.200]  to have him he just flew back in from Mexico last night into New York he's

[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.320]  next hour I don't know what it was about that last interview but I heard from
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.000]  Jesse Spokes it was his favorite interview here on the show listeners said
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.480]  it was their favorite the most views online really great interview we did just
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:39.280]  about a month ago and now governor Jesse Ventura is back with us today the good
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:44.120]  news is but here it is here's the book down here on the floor Jesse Ventura
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.680]  American Conspiracy has been as high as number four on the New York Times best
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.120]  seller list it's been holding up at seven in the top ten and that shows the
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:56.200]  people are hungry for the truth so I just want to say congratulations to
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.560]  governor Jesse Ventura on another best-selling book well thank you Alex
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:03.240]  and thanks for the help because you certainly help in your show and listeners
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:09.160]  on that but it's what's interesting Alex is that the book has not been reviewed by
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:15.480]  any book reviewer oh isn't that amazing here it's been in the New York Times top
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:20.800]  ten for four weeks now I think and not one reviewer has even reviewed the book
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:24.600]  well I think that's an endorsement just like the Huffington Post censored your
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:29.280]  article about 9-eleven even though they asked you to write it now you're seeing
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.560]  censorship in the book world that's unheard of four weeks New York Times top
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:39.080]  ten and no book reviews yeah well there's a few reviews on the
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:43.080]  internet but there haven't been there's been no reviews by any of the major
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:48.400]  media no reviews of the book at all I think it's a case Alex where they feel
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.720]  that if they review it they give it credibility so they're staying away
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:56.040]  from it unbelievable we'll walk through some of the things that are covered in
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:59.400]  the book and why it's seen as controversial but you know that's why
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:03.240]  the mainstream media is dying is because people know they're acting as
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:08.960]  gatekeepers oh there's no doubt about it you know they I just spoke earlier on
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:14.560]  another show and they asked me how I if why the mainstream media won't question
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:18.680]  the government and I said it's simple because if they don't play along with
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:23.480]  the government they get no access to them and if they're denied access to
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:28.200]  them they're dead in the water so therefore they go along to get along so
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:32.360]  that they can do their jobs and continue to have access with you know the
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:36.400]  senators the congressman the president and all that stuff because if they
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:42.720]  question anything they lose that access which is the kiss of death it is the
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:48.440]  kiss of death when we come back I want to get into the war we're now almost
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:53.640]  seven years into Iraq or we are seven years in now in March last month this
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:58.720]  was the seventh anniversary we're eight years into Afghanistan and there's just
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:03.000]  no end in sight I mean when is it gonna end first thing I'd like to ask you
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:10.160]  Alex is what the hell are we accomplishing a bunch of weapon sales and
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:15.080]  oil you know that's the that's the bottom line for me and maybe I say
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:21.600]  this selfishly but how is these two wars help Jesse Ventura or how is these
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:27.600]  two wars helped Alex Jones or how these two wars helped the average Joe citizen
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:33.600]  of this country other than bankrupting us what is the ultimate goal that we will
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:40.360]  achieve to where we can all feel good about them absolutely I mean if our
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:43.800]  country was invaded that'd be one thing or even if we were an evil empire and
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:48.080]  the empire gave us some of the booty but no we we pay for it for offshore
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:53.320]  corporations to get them the money in power exactly and we're sitting here
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:59.000]  our kids are dying over there well you know it clearly shows me Alex people
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.320]  should really wake up to the fact that the president date in charge that's a
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:10.560]  good point because because clearly Obama ran to get us out of the wars he said
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:15.840]  close down to get more he said all of this stuff and yet it's all gone the
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:24.080]  opposite way hasn't it it has more into the wars get more still here so people
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:30.120]  should see clearly that the president is no longer in charge of the country and
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:35.720]  then the next question is what do we do to reverse that and I've documented that
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:39.840]  the government's provocaturing militias and other groups to demonize the tea
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:43.680]  parties and any opposition to that we'll talk about it all with former

[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.760]  and we were discussing during the break
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:20.320]  that that this points out that the president isn't really the president
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:23.000]  and and doesn't have the power let's break it down
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.360]  well i really don't think he does and what's really educated me alex is i've
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:31.680]  been reading i've read i'm in the process of finishing my second book by
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:34.280]  colonel fletcher probably
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:38.560]  and i highly recommend both of them people need to read the colonel's book
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:41.560]  he died in two thousand one if you'd
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:45.200]  but if you read fletcher probably books one of them is called the secret
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.120]  team
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:49.280]  and the other one is called kfk
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:53.560]  and if you read those two books it will become very clear that the history
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:56.920]  you've been taught is not the history of what's happened
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:00.040]  and you've let me make my point here for a moment
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:05.320]  proudie was there who fletcher proudie was do you remember the movie kfk by
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.840]  oliver storm of course
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:11.240]  yes he is the donald southerland character
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:16.680]  he is the real life mr x the guy that that costner ghosted washington
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:20.440]  and talks to him on the steps of the lincoln memorial when they sit on that
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.240]  bench
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:25.720]  and he lays the whole thing out well in real life that was colonel
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:30.600]  but leero fletcher proudie colonel united states air force and for i think
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.520]  eleven or twelve years
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:39.880]  he was the top man the liaison between the pentagon and the cia
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:44.600]  and i can't tell people how much they need to read to understand again when
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:48.440]  you read proudie's books you will become much more clear on what's
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:52.440]  happening because proudie tells you in the books
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:56.760]  that the entire cold war was a setup
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:01.480]  that there was a meeting that took place at the end of world war two
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:05.400]  right before we were going to we technically were going to invade japan
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:09.320]  like normandy and then of course they dropped the two bombs and they didn't
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:13.720]  have to but in in preparing for that invasion they
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:19.640]  moved massive armaments into okinawa well there was a meeting
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:24.440]  because proudie flew in shangkai shek and it was between shangkai shek who at
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:27.400]  that time was ahead of china starlin
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:32.120]  Churchill and roosevelt and at that point it was determined that our wars
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:35.560]  would cement on would be fought in third world countries
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:40.520]  that there would be no direct objective that the military could achieve in
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:45.400]  which to declare victory now look back alex and our history since world war
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:51.000]  two is that not all true that is it's all true
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:56.040]  that's what really resonated with me when i read proudie's books i went oh my god
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:01.160]  the things he said here is exactly what has gone down
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.360]  let me be clear it's a fought in third world countries
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:08.200]  oh and remember them armaments that i told you they turned okinawa
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:12.600]  you know what became of those no they were split in half
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.520]  half of them according to colonel proudie half of them went to korea
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:20.280]  and half of it went to hochi min
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:26.360]  they were setting up for the next two wars now governor follows through with
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:29.400]  all of this excuse me from the radio i shouldn't
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:33.000]  said that but all of this stuff in afghanistan
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.800]  iraq and all of it fits right in the rep colonel proudie talked about
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.920]  well i'm chomping at the bit here and i want to sit back and shut up and you
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:44.680]  can tell us what you learned but this is what's so incredible i've known you
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:49.240]  for about four and a half years now and the process you knew about gulf of
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.920]  tonkin you knew about the lives of vietnam you were very well informed
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:56.040]  you've been visited by the cia when you were governor
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:00.280]  but it's been a process of you reading and researching and now to see you i
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:03.400]  interviewed proudie had to be like a 1997
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:07.320]  we've been digging around looking for the tapes and i have read over his work
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:10.200]  i've read his first book not the second one you're talking about
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.800]  and then you discover that joe mccarthy was actually right
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:16.760]  but he was being used to set up a police state
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:21.720]  domestically with low-level communists but as soon as he found out the pentagon
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:24.920]  was running everything remember that was what they said was so absurd
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:28.760]  then they set him up and destroyed him and used the term mccarthyism to
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:32.920]  demonizing but then it was declassified seven years ago or six years ago
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.520]  that the russian said no it's true he was right and then you learn
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:40.840]  that the whole geopolitical system is a war against individual populations
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:44.200]  there was a deal with the russians to build up their police state
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:47.800]  they would take over half the world the u.s would build up its police state
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:52.520]  military system and take over its other half and go into these black hole wars
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:56.440]  to then militarize a cadre of men to come back and take over
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:00.360]  the domestic country itself and now you're researching that governor it's so
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:03.640]  exciting well you know the thing is now it is
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:07.480]  is this alex i have the time to do it now
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:10.760]  you know when you're being a governor you're governing the state or you're
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:14.040]  working in that capacity you don't have time to do any
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:19.160]  research because your day is full 24 hours a day seven days a week
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:24.600]  just doing your job and now i don't have that job to do anymore
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:28.440]  and living in mexico like i do for half the year
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.040]  i read 15 to 17 books every winter down there
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:35.400]  and it's amazing how reading to educate you
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:38.360]  something i think we're losing track of in this country
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:42.520]  well i want to be specific it's amazing to see your development and i'm not
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:46.840]  like on some mountain saying that because i've noticed your discernment
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:49.480]  with issues getting into the whole conspiracy realm
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:53.240]  you go right to the best sources the best documents the best history
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:56.920]  and it it's it's just very exciting governor minterra
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.280]  uh to see you with a hit tv show a best-selling book
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.600]  and to really be one of the main leaders now
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:06.440]  of questioning our reality but but i don't want to interrupt go back
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:09.240]  give people the name of the book again because i want to go buy it and read it
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:13.800]  uh flexor proudy on record the head of black ops between the pentagon
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:20.920]  and cia he was sent away uh you know uh to the arctic uh when they killed jfk
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:24.600]  he talked about how they pulled the security off how it was a pentagon
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:28.360]  black ops job we're gonna play a clip from jfk coming up later but
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:32.040]  take your time in the break with more of what you've learned and how you tie that
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:35.480]  in to all your other life knowledge well
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:40.680]  again it's a case that uh you know flexor proudy just uh he lived through it
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:44.520]  and uh i i enjoy reading what he knows about me
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:50.440]  he's an exceptionally bright guy see the other thing he shows very clearly
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:54.360]  which tells you how obama isn't really in charge
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:59.080]  proudy shows you that most of the politicians only learn of these
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:02.680]  events till they're already in motion
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:07.160]  they're set in motion by people in the government
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:12.040]  you know people in the cia at lower you know not the high-level positions but
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:16.920]  in the secondary positions they're the ones that move forward on all this stuff
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:20.760]  the wars every all the pretty stuff that goes on
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:24.680]  so that by the time our elected politicians are briefed on it
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:28.760]  this thing's already halfway to life it's already happening
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:32.840]  so they really our politicians are playing catch-up
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:37.640]  and national proudy explains in that book the secret team
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:42.120]  that's who the secret team is the secret team are these
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:47.240]  right under level government people who are literally running amok and there's
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:52.040]  nobody in control of them and uh you know the cia has its own
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:57.320]  money now and own money sources so they can basically do anything they want
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:01.240]  and our president and the rest of them seem to be powerless to them
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:05.080]  well that's what ron paul said two months ago in a speech that will cue that up
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:08.760]  it's about 20 seconds he said we've had a cia coup since the 60s
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:12.600]  they're bringing the drugs we have a shadow government and my whole point is
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:16.280]  we have to come to the point as a nation to realize
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:21.080]  presidents come and go but the secret teams run by the big wall street banks
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:26.360]  that set up the cia rule this country and by extension the world
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.400]  yeah pretty much
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:36.360]  that's the information that i'm arriving at it's not a nice arrival but
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:42.360]  you know what can we do um well i've been harping on it for about 12 years
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:47.080]  alex you can start by stop voting for democrats and republicans
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:50.280]  i don't care who you vote for don't vote for them
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:53.880]  they're the problem they're not the solution
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:57.880]  and that that's you know really it gets to that then of course you have to
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:02.440]  question is the voting reel because with these electronic voting machines they
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:06.440]  can be hacked into so you've got a question whether your votes are
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:09.960]  actually legitimate even in this country anymore
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:15.000]  exactly let me back you up what you just said you take gulf of
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.240]  tonkin i sat through many hours of lbj at his ranch
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.920]  outside austin johnson city a couple miles from where i said
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:26.360]  and mac namara and mac namara is telling him what to do
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:29.720]  and telling him they just staged the gulf of tonkin and that this is what he's
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:33.800]  going to say in a press conference tomorrow and uh the president's almost
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:37.240]  saying yes sir doing and it's the same thing with bay of pigs they launched
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:40.840]  that without kennedy knowing and then blamed it on him when it failed
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:44.360]  exactly and you gotta understand too it ain't mac namara
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:49.000]  mac namara is being briefed through he probably only learned about it the week
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.960]  ahead of lbj no no that's on the tape he's saying exactly he says
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:57.560]  these tapes are incredible he's saying the pentagon did this this is what you're
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:01.720]  going to say yep and see he's been briefed see
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:07.320]  fletcher proudy said the chief of this are these briefer guys these these guys
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:12.440]  that the that the pentagon has and the cia have who do the briefings of the
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:18.120]  politicians they're the ones who sell the politician on the policy
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:21.560]  and it comes from them you want to interview ray mcgovern he was a top
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:25.400]  cia briefer to reagan and bush the first and he agrees with everything you're
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:28.760]  saying yeah well that's what fletcher proudy said
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:32.600]  and i and i i haven't found a thing he's been wrong with yet
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:38.200]  no it's all accurate incredible jesse ventura uh... always wise always informed
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:41.400]  but just to know that he is really on the fast
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:46.040]  track to the key the planetary control it's all staged
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:49.080]  in the past it was there is a split between russia now it appears
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:53.320]  but in the past all rigged two empires carving up the world
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:20:01.880]  we'll be right back with governor jesse ventura

[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:22.920]  serious guy but lately uh you have really seemed happy
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:27.560]  why are you so happy uh mexico does that to me alex
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:31.720]  when i get down there you know i spent friday and saturday the waves were
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:35.080]  great they were running about three three and a half feet and uh they were
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:39.720]  coming in perfect for surfing so i had two great days of surfing down
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:43.720]  there and uh whenever i can live that lifestyle i get very
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:46.920]  content and very pleased with the world
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:50.840]  i hear you and and first you have a tsunami and then the earthquake but no
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:53.560]  problems no i didn't even feel the earthquake the
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:57.080]  earthquake happened way up by mexico tally which is right on the border of
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:00.680]  mexico and california oh i do want to hear one thing when we talk
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:05.480]  about alex that i wanted to word out to people on please allow me to do it here
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:09.560]  everyone out there that knows anyone in the state of california
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:15.800]  please encourage them this far to vote for the legalization of marijuana
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:19.400]  it's going to be on the ballot in california full legalization to where
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:22.600]  marijuana would be treated like alcohol and tobacco
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:26.280]  and the reason i'm pleading with people to support this
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:33.080]  is to stop the carnage at the border alex is awful 17 000 people have died on
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:37.960]  the mexican u.s border just in the last year i know it's it's a war zone it's a
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:42.520]  war zone and we can end it we can end it by simply legalizing
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:46.520]  because that puts the cartels out of business they have nothing to sell then
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:50.440]  but that's common sense all these fake conservatives say that's of the devil
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:53.880]  meanwhile the cia wants to keep all the drugs illegal
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:57.640]  so they have an excuse to put people in prison and so they can launder the money
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:01.720]  exactly but see we've got it here's a chance where we've got it in the palm of
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:06.280]  our hand alex if the elections legitimate out in california
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:09.720]  the people out there can vote for the first step
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:14.520]  full legalization of marijuana and i think if you see california do it it'll
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:17.720]  go like wildfire right across the country
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:22.440]  absolutely so you've heard it here folks vote for the decriminalization
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:25.320]  legalization of marijuana in california
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:30.040]  here's a roiders article nato rejects russian call for afghan poppy spraying
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:34.120]  nato wins the rejected russian calls for to eradicate opium poppy fields
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:38.360]  in afghanistan saying the best way for moscow to help control the drug
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:41.560]  would be to give more assistance against the insurgency then i was
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:45.880]  listening to bbc a few months ago and they were admitting that the u.s.
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:48.680]  protects the opium to be friends with the locals
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:52.360]  and it's up more than 12 times what it was nine years ago
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:55.880]  and there's opium flooding the world right now what's your take on government
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:59.800]  drug dealing and that they're openly protecting the poppy fields well you
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:04.920]  know look at it this way alex the major banks the international banks of the
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:08.520]  world where do you think about money because millions and billions of
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:13.080]  dollars for the for the heroin trade gets laundered through
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:16.760]  and look at the timing of it the rough street crash
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:21.560]  happened right at the time the caliban put the poppy growers out of business
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:26.600]  okay how about yep because all and then there may be a correlation there
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:31.080]  we're talking about 2000 2001 hundred money these billions of dollars of
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:35.240]  laundered drug money and that could very well have hurt the cash flow of these
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:39.480]  banks and that very well could have been i'm not saying it's the full
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:43.080]  thing but it certainly could have been part of the catalyst that made
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:47.400]  double the rough street crash happen in a wait
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:50.840]  well there's also the fact that the caliban was cutting it off in 2000
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:57.480]  2001 and you had the crash of 2001 yep notice how every time the drugs get
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:01.240]  cut off it seems rough street crash is shortly
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:04.760]  thereafter well you're right on that front again but how
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:08.680]  can they just be in Reuters saying we're not going to eradicate any poppy
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:12.760]  fields i mean how obvious is that
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:16.680]  well it's the old thing of the way we fight the worst today
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:20.680]  you know sometimes the people you get in bed with are worse than the people you're
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:24.760]  fighting you're absolutely right uh you know
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:27.880]  governor jesse vinter i have a lot of questions that i want to ask here in my
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:30.840]  list but going out to break on the short segment
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:33.880]  uh what else do you want to relate to this audience that you think's important
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:37.000]  well again just to be vigilant and pay attention
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.320]  and uh and to question your government at all times because it needs to be
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:44.840]  questioned uh right now you know like i said it should
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:49.000]  be clear to everyone that brock obama is not in charge
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.240]  i don't believe that he is now because you see everything that he ran on
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:57.480]  is he hasn't come through on virtually anything he's now on the opposite camp
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:02.280]  really and it's almost like he arrived there with this fresh clean
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:06.440]  agenda and it was like they took him to the witch hut and told him well you
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:09.400]  might be the president but you don't run things
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:12.920]  well certainly plus they financed him they financed mccain no matter
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:17.160]  who gets in they control them oh yeah absolutely you know you you look at
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:21.160]  obama's biggest contributor was gordon sacks
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:25.560]  and uh they're the ones that uh what is it the last five or six department of
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:28.520]  treasury secretaries have come out of there and
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:32.680]  absolutely and then you look at chili iceland
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:36.680]  uh you look at uh greece you look at all these countries
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:41.080]  first world second world they're all run by goldman sacks people that's the
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:45.000]  key heart to this group a ton of questions straight ahead for governor

[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:26.680]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation

[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:48.040]  never listening to my radio show again because i played the gun pod footage
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:51.960]  from the apaches killing these reporters shooting these kids
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:56.920]  laughing about it and then lying about it later all these other massacre videos
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:01.800]  here's the new york times today u.s forces horrifying afghanistan cover-up
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:05.240]  uh... obviously we're not saying the individual troops are all bad but pat
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:09.000]  tillman went over there found that it was a fraud wrote letters home that's a
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.800]  show you should do i talked to some of his family wouldn't come on air they
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:15.000]  believe it was a head the evidence came out they did cover up the friendly
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.240]  fire they killed him up a point blank range
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:22.440]  three shots in the head i mean art as pleasure pouty wrote and he ran black
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:27.960]  ops we propped up the soviet we set it all up its stage it's eating our entire
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:32.840]  system isn't unpatriotic to criticize corrupt illegal wars
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:37.640]  no it's not uh... you know we went through this in vietnam i would think that
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:41.640]  this country would have a little bit longer memory
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:45.640]  i was the same type of affair took place in vietnam where you have the
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:51.160]  the massacre at me like you know people and and believe me i'm not blaming the
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:54.360]  soldiers i'm blaming the politicians
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:57.000]  because it's ultimately there
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.160]  you know
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:00.440]  result of failed policy
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:04.280]  failed politics and the end result is war
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:09.000]  and it's so when your politicians fail you you go to war
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:14.760]  and because of their failure they put our young men and women into these wars
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:19.560]  well what they did of course they did what they did is not good but let's
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:23.800]  remember something some of these guys are on their fifth sixth and seventh
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:27.480]  tour over there they've been hardened now they've
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:31.000]  been changed they are not the same people that left
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:38.280]  trust me on that and so war there is nothing great and glorious about war
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:41.960]  war is the worst thing man's ever come up with
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:46.600]  and that's killing each other over what political reasons religion
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:50.040]  whatever stupidity we might decide to go to war
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:56.680]  and murder each other over and so no you are not wrong in showing this because
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:59.880]  what's wrong is filtering people from it
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:04.520]  that's why these wars are going on alex is because the american people have
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:08.920]  been filtered the media is not portraying what's happening over there
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:13.640]  and they're not even showing the body bags when they come home
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:17.160]  well you're absolutely right and you talked about
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:20.840]  fletcher proudy who ran black ops in the pentagon that's on record
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:25.240]  the liaison to the cia and he's documenting how they made the decision
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:28.680]  at the end of world war two to attack third world countries
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:32.760]  to divide them to never have an outcome so the armaments industries
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:36.280]  could make a lot of money and get a lot of power and then we sit here and say
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:40.440]  that's exactly what afghanistan and iraq are we know this is the policy of
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:44.440]  divide and conquer we know they're turning our country into a militarized
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:47.960]  surveillance police state and it's our right as citizens
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:51.960]  to say that we don't want to be part of these illegal wars that george washington
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:55.480]  said you know that we shouldn't be involved in foreign wars
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:37:00.520]  well again i guess sometimes a war is justified
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:05.640]  you know there are occasions you know where a war just gotta go fight because
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:09.080]  there may be a tyrant like a dog Hitler out there
[01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:14.360]  and and that type of situation but ever since world war two
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:18.200]  you cannot tell me one word that has been justified
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:22.360]  but you talked about it being a failed policy failed from our perspective
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:26.440]  but if we know they're premeditated to be quagmires to make money
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:29.400]  then it's not a failed policy you know they say the war on drugs is a failure
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:33.080]  there's more drugs more people in prison but for the big banks and the
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:37.080]  military industrial complex that's a success oh yeah very much so
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:40.200]  for the people need to always remember there are
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:44.600]  profiteers at war there are people that wait for war
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:49.640]  because they become exceptionally wealthy when there's wars fought and
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:53.480]  these are the people that lead these are the lobbyists
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:57.720]  that get those secret team guys at that level of government
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:02.440]  to move forward like here's what proudy also brings out very clearly
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:07.880]  he brings out the fraud of the CIA we all believe the CIA is there to gather
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:11.960]  intelligence right yes well proudy says that's about
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:16.040]  10 percent of what they do the other 90 percent
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:20.120]  is carrying out these military agendas and creating the wars
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:24.760]  and assassinations yeah well that's what helps create the wars
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:30.360]  see they they were designed by Harry Truman to not set policy they were
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:33.080]  supposedly to be there only to provide
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:37.080]  information for the president and Alan Dulles
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:41.720]  proudy makes it very clear that Alan Dulles and of course he's neck deep a
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:44.840]  member of the Warren commission and all that on Kennedy
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:48.680]  Alan Dulles is the one that created today's CIA
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:53.000]  this this independent rogue outlaw state that is
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.840]  uncontrollable now even by our own government though they're on their own
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:01.480]  now they're called boys where do you see this going because
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:06.360]  i have a bloomberg report here in my stack
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:11.000]  where the federal government is telling uh...
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:15.080]  private and public pension funds you must invest quote in failed banks
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:18.360]  and now they're getting ready to go after people's pension funds
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:24.200]  are they trying to push the american people into some type of armed revolt
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:29.800]  he i i believe they're trying to destroy the middle class
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:35.720]  absolutely and why are because we're the only country that's ever really had one
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:39.320]  that that's always been the american dream is that
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:43.880]  you can rise from poverty in this country and you can become a millionaire
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:48.840]  well that dream is vanishing quickly uh... there is not going to be a middle
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:53.080]  class in about fifteen years i don't believe there will just be rich and
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:57.480]  poor and therefore we will be like every other country around the globe
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:00.680]  and maybe alex is being done to globalize
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:04.680]  mexico canada enough absolutely north american
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:08.440]  union that way people are so poor they can't ever resist
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:11.720]  the ruling class here's a bloomer article they got to bring us down to
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:15.720]  mexico's level oh exactly that's what the globalists say
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:19.960]  uh... in effect there's a clip we have of obama where he says in this new world
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:25.160]  order no nation can be above another but that doesn't mean raise the third
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:28.280]  world in the globalist documents they want to lower everybody
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:32.600]  yeah they would rather lower us down to the third world level
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:37.000]  unbelievable to raising up the third world's our level
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.280]  let's uh... read this bloomberg headline for folks that are doubting me failed
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:43.560]  banks may get pension fund backing is fdic six cash
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:46.360]  the federal deposit insurance corporation is trying to encourage public
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:50.680]  retirement funds that control for the two trillion to buy all our part of
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:54.520]  failed lenders assets taking on a more direct role
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:57.640]  in propping up banking systems and it talks about how the regulators are
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:01.320]  ordering them to do it since when do regulators order private
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:05.240]  and public pension funds to be invested in in in the failed banks
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:11.560]  and since when would you look at the clear conscience want to invest in a failed bank
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:14.680]  well the government says jesse they want to grab your 401k and give it to the
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:18.840]  bankers well
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:23.880]  i'll tell you alex i don't know if they do want an on the street resolution
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:27.880]  i don't know well i know they've been setting up for an infiltrating i know
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:31.320]  they infiltrated these militias and set them up to create the illusion
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:34.120]  there's about to be all this domestic terror and i believe they're getting
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:37.000]  ready to stage terror attacks governor to blame it
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:41.320]  on the american people to use north com against the american people
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:45.880]  so that what they can empower themselves into top martial law type situation
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:49.480]  i know they've been making preparations for two decades in urness starting with
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:53.320]  oliver north and i know i've never seen such a build up towards it
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:57.640]  okay well it's something we all got to be aware of
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:02.680]  without a doubt but uh you know there's still a lot of masses out there and uh
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:07.320]  we're still very powerful but the only thing is we have to learn to use our
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:11.880]  power well you've got a powerful voice as a political icon and independent of
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:15.480]  former governor what would you say to the american people
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:18.840]  if we see some terror attacks they're blaming the american people
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:23.240]  and they start trying to use these different enemy combatant acts belligerent
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:28.360]  acts to start grabbing us citizens well you know i think the first thing we
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:32.520]  need to do is this i think we need to put huge pressure
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:37.400]  on the obama administration to rescind the patriot act
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:40.840]  yes i think that would be the great starting point
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:45.480]  for people to start marching and demanding that the patriot act be
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:49.880]  abolished because the patriot act is the thing that's
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:52.920]  taking away our freedoms it's taking away
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:57.640]  habeas corpus where they can arrest you simply say you committed a terrorist
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:01.400]  act you can't get a lawyer they can hold you without a trial
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:05.640]  and people in this country better wake up because what they're doing to them guys
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:09.640]  at guantanamo down at gitmo they could do to you
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:12.600]  well that's what the belligerent act states that
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:16.280]  john mccain's introduced and lindsay graham's supporting it says for any
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:19.640]  intelligence reason or any direction of the president
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:22.840]  citizens can be grabbed and given enhanced interrogation
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:27.720]  and never be seen again i'm not kidding i haven't had judgment holler mccain
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:32.120]  absolutely the supporting something like that guys print the belligerent act i
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:34.200]  want to read governor vinter the actual passage
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:38.360]  yes sir and i had judged the politano on is a former federal judge
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:42.280]  and he pointed out it says that the fact that you've been grabbed
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:45.960]  is a secret unless the house and senate intelligence committee
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:49.480]  vote to allow it to be known you've even been grabbed
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:55.000]  really well then let me say this on your show alex
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:59.640]  i will never disappear by my own choice
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:04.040]  good point so i've said it now on your show
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:08.760]  so everybody knows that if jessie ventura suddenly disappears
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:13.560]  they'll know that i i wouldn't do that other than to go surfing in mexico and
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:16.920]  you know that i'll come back every spring
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:20.840]  well i tell you that brings me to the next question i mean as things heat up as
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:23.720]  you become even more prominent if that's possible that you
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:27.560]  certainly are and as people's respect for you goes even higher
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:30.840]  we need to take good care of you so watch out there aren't some frog men out
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:34.680]  there when you're surfing that try to try to make you disappear be careful
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:38.440]  hope you're strapping a sidearm or at least a spear gun when you're out there
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:43.480]  no i you know when you're i i've always been a pretty good swimmer alex and
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:47.320]  and i can take care of myself in the water
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:52.200]  and i truly don't believe any of my co team mates would do that to me
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:54.920]  no i don't think they wouldn't either you know what they don't believe that
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:58.600]  would happen and so i maybe i'm wrong but i i don't
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:02.600]  think so and uh but uh no it's just a case again
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:07.000]  where we we've got to keep talking when when when like that lady that's
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.880]  went through that thing i have sympathy for her son
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:13.240]  who's over there fighting because it's our fault
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:18.360]  people need to understand this also we can end all these wars by bringing the
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:22.120]  draft back then i used to be on the abolished the draft
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:25.400]  movement after vietnam but now i realize that the
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:30.840]  professional military is a mistake because the problem is this when you
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:36.440]  get a professional military like we have we the public are then not vigilant
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:41.400]  we need to be vigilant to never send those young men and women into harm's
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:46.680]  way unless it is absolutely essential well now we've got a mercenary army i
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:50.280]  think we should ban that first and then totally
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:54.200]  you got to get rid of these mercenaries you got to get rid of black leather
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:57.880]  you got to get rid of all of them groups of them because there's actually more
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:00.920]  mercenaries in iraq today than there are soldiers
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:05.000]  well i've talked to anthony shaver special forces colonel commander
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.520]  and he talked about how the cia wouldn't let him kill bin laden two weeks before
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:11.320]  9 11 and he said that was being done because they
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:15.480]  already had contractors in the cia with more power than the army
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:18.600]  and the navy and that they basically are above the law
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:23.240]  they could do whatever they want so in proudies book you'll find out the cia
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:29.720]  runs our military our military is used to back up whatever the cia is getting
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:33.080]  involved with well that's what uh that's what
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:37.720]  colonel uh shaver says yeah oh yeah proudie says it too
[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:42.360]  well he might be good to interview anthony shaver uh he's on fox and msnbc
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:45.480]  and cnn all of them let me read this to you just so it's on record
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:49.320]  in fact here's the bill right here racing through the senate right now
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:52.520]  the centers to be detained as enemy belligerence
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:56.440]  the full bill can be read here a person is considered a high value detainee if
[01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:00.120]  they fulfill one of the following criteria and it says uh
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:03.000]  number three potential intelligence value number five
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.120]  such other matters as the president considers appropriate and it says the
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:10.520]  enemy belligerent interrogation detention and prosecution act of 2010
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:13.720]  and it says they can secretly grab you put a bag over your head
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:16.920]  and then they can use intent enhanced interrogation
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:20.680]  which is torture i mean what's your take on
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:27.400]  alex torture you to do what i guess to to say you're guilty well i don't know
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:31.160]  okay let's say hypothetically they grabbed me
[01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:35.240]  what would they torture me to find out
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:39.160]  that's the whole point they only torture for terror and to get false
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:43.400]  confessions okay so i'd have to confess to something then right
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:47.960]  yes okay that's what i was interested in why on earth would they do you know
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:51.560]  would they pick someone and then torture them for what purpose
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:55.320]  well now if we ever have another big war and people torture our troops how can
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:59.320]  we say it's wrong we can't we haven't been able to do
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:04.360]  that since how to grab and go get more we can't we can't you know
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:09.080]  let me throw this out for your listeners to understand this to alex
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:14.600]  you know we the united states and let me reiterate my father's a world war two
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:19.080]  vet my mother's a world war two vet my brother and i are both vietnam vets
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:22.680]  i say that because of what i'm going to tell you now
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:26.920]  we in the united states have been practicing terrorism for 50 years
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:32.360]  we just call it foreign policy yes because we've been terrorizing cuba
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:36.280]  we've attempted to kill castron multiple occasions
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:41.240]  we've we've ruined their cane fields we've attempted to destroy their economy
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:45.800]  and now do you know about this character orlando bosh
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:49.240]  tell folks about it well orlando bosh was a guy
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:56.920]  who blew up blew up a civilian cuban airliner or the cia and got protected
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:01.640]  what no there were 73 people on board now is that not an act of terrorism
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:09.960]  it is well this senior pardoned him yes this guy that blew up a plane with 73
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:15.320]  people on it in fact we need to realize that
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:19.560]  we need to take our heads out of the sand the citizens of the united states of
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:23.480]  america and start realizing think of it this way
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:28.440]  why do we have to spend so much money on our defense budget
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:31.960]  of course after us and for what reason
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:35.560]  what are we protecting ourselves from obviously
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:39.080]  we haven't behaved very well throughout the world
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:44.120]  because clearly if we're in such danger that literally half of our money in our
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:49.240]  taxes have to go to defense spending what does that tell you
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:51.880]  well i wanted to add that that individual you mentioned we cover in
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:55.960]  terror storm it's declassified that he blew up a plane
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:50:00.040]  full of the olympic team for the cubans yeah
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:05.080]  so so again and then there really isn't many people attacking us so the
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:09.720]  military industrial complex goes out in finances terror groups or stages attacks
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:13.880]  as the pretext to ratchet up the naked body scanners and the face
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:18.600]  scanners and the control yeah maybe well you may well be right on that
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:23.880]  because again you know we've been practicing terrorism for 50 years we
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:28.280]  just call it foreign policy you know i mean look at all the
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:32.040]  look at all the people we've tried to assassinate down in central america
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:36.120]  that's not terrorism when you go in and attempt just
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:40.040]  because the country has a different form of government than you have
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:44.600]  what gives us the right to go into that country and attempt to assassinate their
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:47.480]  leader well if they try to hear they'd be called
[01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:51.240]  terrorist i'm skipping this network break we've got about nine minutes left
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:55.240]  but jesse ventura this is a network break we're skipping it not station break
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:59.480]  just word everybody out there who's just joined us info wars dot com prison
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:03.160]  planet dot tv i want to encourage all the listeners to
[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:06.920]  not procrastinate and get jesse ventura's american conspiracies
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:10.840]  at info wars dot com you get the book five dollars off the book in hard cover
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:15.400]  and then get the film of your choice with the book when you get it that's how
[01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:18.280]  much i want you to read it info wars dot com
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:21.000]  governor we've only got about ten minutes left with your nine minutes left and
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.440]  there's so many other things i wanted to talk about with you
[01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:28.120]  uh... shifting gears into something uh... just as serious because you are
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:31.000]  informing millions of people every week
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:34.680]  your television show when is it going to be back on the airwaves
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:39.320]  that can you give us any uh... of you into uh... what does some of the episodes
[01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:45.160]  may be about and right now we're just ramping up they just got the budget
[01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:49.480]  approved my son is finally i think you'll get a paycheck next week
[01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:54.040]  so that means it's actually happening because that's how you judge in l.a.
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:58.120]  a project's happening when you get a check and it clears the bank
[01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:02.760]  yes well he should be getting paid next week
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:06.040]  uh... for his participation opening participation
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:10.760]  participation in the show we'll be ramping up we haven't peered down to
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:16.440]  what the ten uh... what the ten uh... uh... conspiracies will be
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:24.280]  but i will tell you they they are allowing me to go back after jfk
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:27.640]  so we will be taking one trip back to the past
[01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:32.600]  and uh... we're going to unleash some probably new things on the john f
[01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:35.960]  kennedy assassination that i don't believe anybody else
[01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:39.640]  and if and if we're successful on one of the things we do
[01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:44.360]  it will completely show that it was that that that it was a conspiracy and
[01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:46.760]  that does what did not act alone
[01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:51.880]  amazing and that's all i'll say for now because i don't care going farther
[01:52:51.880 --> 01:52:54.760]  well if you don't know the if you don't know the past you're not going to know
[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:57.560]  the future exactly and you know and then
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:02.680]  uh... other other things that are are on the radar screen are you familiar with
[01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:06.200]  this plumb island oh biological weapons zoological
[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:09.480]  weapons laboratory off the coast of new york where we got Lyme disease
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:12.840]  and so much more now they've built 36 of these in major cities
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:17.240]  yeah well we're good with that that's not that's on the screen right now
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:20.520]  and there's a few other good ones and again we're just carrying them down
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:24.280]  now we'll probably see what happens is this
[01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:28.280]  third tv will start off and they'll approve like two or three of them
[01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:32.680]  so we'll go ahead and begin working on them then in the process of working on
[01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:36.440]  them other approvals will come for the other shows
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:40.280]  yeah and so then don't that then the staff will start ramping up for those
[01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:44.600]  shows also but what gets confusing in doing the shows
[01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:49.160]  is that sometimes we'll be doing four of them at one time
[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:52.680]  well you guys aren't half-assing this either you do a lot of research a lot
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:55.240]  of work a lot goes into this television show
[01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:59.640]  well i'll tell you for our for our for our little
[01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:05.320]  purse string budget that we're we do a hell of a job because you know what i
[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:08.600]  actually couldn't in negotiations this year
[01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:13.160]  what i was already locked in for the second season so i couldn't negotiate
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:17.400]  money at all but i couldn't negotiate artistically
[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:21.640]  i told i told my top agent at william morris has said look
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:26.520]  i said i want it in writing that this year will actually get a set of clappers
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:29.160]  for when we're out on the streets
[01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:33.000]  ha ha ha clappers are not right uh... to tell me
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.680]  whether those little boards you see in hollywood with the clickers in front of
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:40.040]  the camera what scene it is blah blah blah and then they clap them
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:43.400]  as you can separate all your shoots
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:47.320]  well we were so cheap in doing this thing initially
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:50.920]  we had to use our hands i remember yeah
[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:55.960]  to clap and so i told them i said look the only thing i demand is that i want
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:59.080]  it in writing that we will have a clapper sent out
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:03.400]  shoots and it was funny because my top agent at william morris
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:07.160]  started laughing and he said governor i can assure you
[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:11.880]  we i'll take it out of our end you will have a clapper this year
[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:17.720]  man i'll tell you you spent so much time with six months of work or more
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:20.680]  over a year making the last television program
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:24.600]  so when will we see this air in the in the fall of this year
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:28.760]  i can't even venture a guess right now because again it'll
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:32.600]  depend on how many of them they want done in the can
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:37.080]  and how many and at what point are we have to finish up whatever is left
[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:40.920]  before they because once they make the decision to start airing them
[01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:45.160]  i've got a feeling they're going to want to have the majority of them done
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:49.000]  so that they can air them weekly like they did last time we're 10 weeks in a
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.040]  row you will get a different conspiracy every week
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:56.120]  well i'm looking forward to working any so venturing in the can i'm just a bit
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:59.080]  piling here venturing at gas i would say the
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:02.120]  soonest we'll be on will be sometime in the fall
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:05.240]  well i look forward to seeing you again in person you're so great so's your son
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:09.800]  and the whole crew the book is american conspiracies available at info wars
[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:11.800]  dot com and everywhere else but we have it discounted
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:15.960]  with a free film at info wars dot com or by calling 888
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:20.600]  two five three three one three nine governor of interva in closing we got
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:24.840]  about three minutes left here studying the new world order studying the global
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:28.200]  elite studying these shadowy organizations
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:31.560]  what has it been like your your your your immersion
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:35.720]  in this and and what is your model now of who's running the world and what their
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:39.720]  agenda is well i still don't know exactly who
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:43.640]  is you know if you're asking me to name names i can't do that even flood your
[01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:47.800]  poverty can't do it no but what their agenda is well to me the agenda is
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:52.440]  simple and it seems clear to me uh... ever since nine eleven it's been an
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:55.560]  agenda to take away our freedoms
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:59.480]  slavery you can leave it right at that because slavery the most dangerous thing
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:03.320]  i've seen that have come out of all of this crap in the last 10 years
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:06.760]  is the fact that they've suspended api's corpus
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:11.080]  they've literally shredded the fourth amendment of illegal search and seizure
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:15.160]  every person in america needs to understand that every phone call you
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:20.120]  make and every email you send the government has the capability to be
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:24.920]  eavesdropping that now are they doing it all of them of course not
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:28.840]  but they have the ability and they have the and they have the
[01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:32.760]  assurance that they can do it because apparently our constant
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:37.240]  you know what's kind of interesting alex is this i now understand why they
[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:40.440]  eradicate marijuana do you know why i can
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:43.880]  understand that what because our constitution
[01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:50.760]  bill of rights are in the flag are made of marijuana that's true
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:53.800]  they're right it's true all the originals are him
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:58.360]  they're all made out of marijuana the constitution the bill of rights and
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:03.560]  that's iraq's flag and so it doesn't surprise me that they
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:07.960]  want to eradicate marijuana because they're eradicating our constitution
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:11.800]  they're eradicating our bill of rights and they certainly eradicated the flag
[01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:15.000]  in my opinion governor i'm going to say bye to you as soon as
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.720]  the show ends here in about 30 seconds but i really want to thank you for
[01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:21.000]  coming on congratulations for doing it your way telling the truth not
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:24.360]  compromising getting a number one hit tv show on your network
[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:27.240]  number four on the new york times bestseller list for the book

[02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:15.640]  monday edition the cabernon suspense talk about the economy
[02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:19.400]  the police state knew that order of the nature of the elites
[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:24.680]  is coming up the next segment let's go ahead and take some more calls
[02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:32.200]  tony and canva you're on the air jason hello yes sir hey how you doing boss
[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:36.360]  all right uh perfect um i just i was doing a lot of
[02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:40.200]  research over the past year because of all the information you guys have been
[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:42.680]  providing of course everybody's thankful for that
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:47.240]  we do appreciate it uh but i haven't been hearing a lot of information about
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:51.080]  uh security companies like converse technology
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:57.240]  and the rent and nice systems as well as noise well they're very revolving door
[02:00:57.240 --> 02:00:59.960]  in homeland security and it's the same in europe
[02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:03.240]  where when somebody's in homeland security they give them the contracts
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:07.080]  and then five years later they move into that company as an executive
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:10.680]  well absolutely and one of the biggest issues is that converse
[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:13.480]  the headquarters is in israel as well as all these other
[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:17.720]  sub companies or umbrella companies like revint and
[02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:21.880]  and norris and all these other companies but they have contracts now with
[02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:26.120]  american telecom communication companies and now
[02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:30.520]  each and every single telephone across north america is really intelligent
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:34.440]  through the system because it's all right i mean that's been for 10 years
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:39.160]  that's been for 10 years absolutely because then they can get around us laws
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:42.680]  because a foreign government is doing the spying and they're giving it back to
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:46.280]  the nsa they claim it doesn't get around the
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:50.920]  law it just hides the criminality no exactly exactly and if you do this to
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:54.680]  try not to leave probably back down to source fire which the major clients are
[02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:57.480]  american defense department the national security department
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:01.400]  and a lot of these people think they go online and they think that they're safe
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:05.960]  through these security companies but uh one of the major companies that i
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:10.280]  saw that was connected to these things is um verisign now verisign
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:14.360]  deals with most of the majority of the credit card securities
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:17.320]  online and everybody trusts this company but verisign
[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:20.680]  it's it's directly linked to one of its major company
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:24.920]  partners is nois systems which also deals with ibm
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:29.400]  neck it also deals with ten link ltd which provides for every single
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:33.880]  stage of level of law and the government you raise up the tech companies they
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:38.360]  want to be preeminent by giving them the contracts great point tell me
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:42.360]  mohammed in colorado you're on the air
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:46.040]  hey so i um i don't know if you've ever seen this on the
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:50.040]  friday or sunday show but i just want to go see uh the new clash of the titans
[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:53.960]  movie yesterday and uh unlike the 80s show that's all
[02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:57.560]  about uh some dude that's kind of left-struck and want to
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:01.960]  fight things uh this one to me was really almost like an allegory
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:05.960]  for the concert of the u.s. so in the movie you've got
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:09.720]  these titans that are defeated by their sons the god
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:13.320]  and the gods make uh people human beings to pray to them
[02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:17.880]  in order for them to kind of live forever and uh so the people become very
[02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:21.480]  distraught with the tyranny of the titans and and kind of rebel until they
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:25.080]  release this kraken that's uh that's supposed to kind of
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:28.680]  put the people back in check and half within the movie i immediately thought
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:33.880]  you know this is kind of like the u.s. you that's uh yeah the one is the kraken
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:39.240]  absolutely right you can release the kraken
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:43.240]  you got people who who who who fled from from
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:47.080]  england the tyranny in england you know and then and so these are represented
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:50.200]  by the gods and so the gods put up a government they
[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:54.600]  they have for some people and you're supposed to pay your taxes to the
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:57.800]  government and right now in the current state the government's becoming
[02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:00.680]  tyrannical and so people are just kind of taking the fans
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:04.200]  saying no no we're not we're not gonna really put up with this tyranny and so
[02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:07.240]  government's like release the kraken you know i'm for the people
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:10.840]  and so half within the movie i really just start to realize you know this is
[02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:14.360]  really almost by america and and about well george
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:18.360]  lucas said that episode three revenge of the sith is where the senator becomes
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:22.120]  the president then the the ruler by staging terror attacks
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:25.800]  and outside military attacks on himself and many of the terrorist armies he's
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:29.240]  running don't even know that they're not really going to win in the end
[02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:33.720]  uh and and lucas said no i you know this is what our government really does do
[02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:38.280]  he's definitely a 9-11 traitor uh so absolutely that's what's going on
[02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:41.560]  yes i suppose you're out there anybody um that that wants to you know take a moment
[02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:44.440]  or leave yourself with some stress wasn't a good movie overall
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:48.520]  oh well it's a pretty good movie and it's just that message that algory's
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:51.640]  very overt so then took out a lot of digging to really realize that so it's
[02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:55.960]  just like now the same well i don't watch a lot of films but i may have to go
[02:04:55.960 --> 02:05:01.000]  watch it so when you're a review here plus i like escapism occasionally

[02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:14.360]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:18.600]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:21.800]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:24.440]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:28.360]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:31.880]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids

[02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:03.320]  wall street in washington dc are chronicled in dylan reed and the

[02:09:24.520 --> 02:09:28.440]  kathleen out of the gates we're going to get into government health care
[02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:31.880]  and your take on what it does
[02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:34.920]  but i first wanted to go to this business week article
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:38.600]  fdic wants pension funds to prop up failed banks
[02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:41.960]  and in fact this isn't the bloomberg this is the uh...
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:46.520]  this is the uh... law story i want the bloomberg or business week i want to
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:49.400]  show people that one uh... this is basically the same article
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:52.680]  i mean here's a link to the bloomberg news the women read the actual quotes
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:56.680]  where they're ordering with this color of law come at the order of the banks to
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:09:59.720]  take the bailout link link uh... to invest public
[02:09:59.720 --> 02:10:02.360]  and private pension funds quote in failed banks
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:05.560]  uh... kathleen arson fitz what is all that about
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:09.960]  well we have seen the pension funds over the last 10 to 20 years
[02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:15.480]  come under significant pressure to invest in a variety of things which have
[02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:20.360]  left the pension funds in real trouble so we have the pension funds the pension
[02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:25.000]  fund american pension funds where the key vehicle is to finance the
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.240]  housing bubble and have gotten you know left holding the bag
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:34.360]  and so that it is incredibly important alex the pension funds
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:38.520]  have the legal protection and authority to finance
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:41.880]  you know what is the right thing to do and and if
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:46.600]  if there's one reform that needs to happen it's a real investigation of why
[02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:52.200]  or why did the pension funds keep doing you know the scams and how do you stop
[02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:55.880]  that because it's left to you know we now have state and local
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:11:00.440]  government and companies having to come up with new big pension fund payments
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:05.400]  because there's been too much political interference i described
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:08.680]  you've heard me tell the story where the president of the largest pension fund in
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:13.080]  the country calper said to me in 1997 when i was trying to interest him in
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:17.080]  refinancing american communities he said it's too late you don't understand
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:20.200]  they've given up on the country they're moving all the money out starting in the
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:23.720]  fall you know and my question is you know who's
[02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:29.480]  they and how can they order you as a pension fund board to just
[02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:33.800]  you know do things with your money and and the reality is
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:39.000]  if if if calpers had invested in the fundamental infrastructure
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.320]  and well-being of american communities and and american infrastructure
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:47.480]  they would have lost a lot less money you know that you know instead of losing
[02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:51.880]  on the top and down and we would have an infrastructure and a nation but this
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:56.520]  is predatory and again you were there at the top of the pyramid watching this
[02:11:56.520 --> 02:12:01.800]  happen trying to stop it on record right even at the time so to be clear we
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:06.520]  have the head nasa climatologist we have the un we have all these world leaders
[02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:10.840]  bill gates saying they want to destroy industrial society so they get you in
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:16.200]  debt get your local governments pension funds police fire you name it
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:20.040]  they move it all offshore right then the country implodes and then they come in
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:23.560]  with even more debt right and they come in they take over health care then they
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:26.520]  run your life go ahead right so then they say your pension funds have lost all
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:31.400]  this money now what's it the fdic up to the last person you should be telling
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:36.360]  the pension funds what they should invest in is the fdic now i say that
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:41.000]  and alex which you need to know is uh you know the patterns appear
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:44.440]  that lots of small banks are being targeted in a way that's ending up
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:47.560]  providing subsidy to the people who pick them up
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:52.120]  in other words we have a double standard in enforcement by the banking
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:55.880]  regulators so the big banks get who've been doing all the
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:12:59.880]  improper things get bailed out and the small banks who've been well managed
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:04.680]  are getting targeted and and taken over in a way that subsidize the big banks
[02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:09.400]  so you have to be careful behind here you know that we don't see the fdic
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:14.360]  driving the small banks into pension funds in a way that is part of an economic
[02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:18.280]  work or a game and my fear is you know the next thing you know you see state
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:20.920]  and local government pension funds financing someone like
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:26.760]  sorus or the big hedge fund operators picking up these small banks for cheap
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:31.000]  absolutely so that's why i brought this article up first and i want you to spend
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:35.400]  some more time on this before we get into some other related issues because
[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:40.200]  here they are in business week in bloomberg uh saying
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:44.200]  and and and obama's people are now out there pushing this that oh
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:47.160]  we're going to just take your pension funds wholesale
[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:51.400]  to protect them and then of course they'll invest those in derivatives again
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:55.160]  then they'll take a large portion of it down the road get people more dependent
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:57.800]  on government well we did take most of it but
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:14:01.000]  you know you've got to stick with us or you won't get any of it
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:07.800]  it's this question should capital be allocated according to one the
[02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:12.040]  preferences of the people who are either responsible own it or control it
[02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:15.720]  two according to economic performance i.e. you know
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:19.720]  what's the best investment or three should it be channeled
[02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:24.600]  according to government dictates to a few small investors that allow them to
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:28.840]  control and own everything well let me stop you again
[02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:35.160]  exactly it sounds good uh that uh in the banking bill the government is now
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:39.640]  officially in the banking business uh slipped into it was a student loan
[02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:42.840]  legislation uh where the government will now be
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:46.600]  the person loaning but really it'll be the government directing you
[02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:52.680]  to specific top three or four uh banks so this is a vertical integration and i
[02:14:52.680 --> 02:14:56.920]  want to be clear here for new listeners the government controls the
[02:14:56.920 --> 02:15:01.080]  regulators they can arrest or set up or shut down or sanction
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:04.760]  any pension fund manager that doesn't do what they're told and here they are in
[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:09.560]  bloomberg openly telling the the federal government
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:14.520]  run by private banks at the top telling the pension fund controllers you will
[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:18.600]  invest with us quote in failed banks so this is
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:22.840]  the government completely taking over society break down
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:27.160]  how serious is the soviet union but here's what you've got
[02:15:27.160 --> 02:15:33.560]  let's say your neighbor alex is an insider and you are an outsider and
[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:37.800]  and your your insider neighborhood plays ball with the government and the
[02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:41.960]  government says you know something you can finance your car for zero percent
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:44.920]  which is what hedge fund operators have been doing they've been on the carrier
[02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:47.640]  trade they've been barring for zero to one percent
[02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:51.800]  and and your neighbor can finance his car with zero percent financing he can
[02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:55.960]  finance his mortgage with zero percent financing and we're going to provide
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:16:00.360]  financing to his we're going to provide equity financing to his business
[02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:04.840]  for two percent meantime you have to pay five percent for your car financing
[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:08.600]  six percent for your mortgage financing and by the way you can't get equity for
[02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:11.960]  your business but you can borrow at the bank for 12 percent if you can get
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:16.120]  somebody to guarantee you okay now how long is it going to take before your
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:19.400]  neighbor has you know a much bigger car a much
[02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:24.280]  bigger house and has bought your business you know that went bankrupt
[02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:28.680]  and if you and we're talking about controlling through
[02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:33.080]  the back door by controlling the cost of capital and certain players
[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:38.280]  get a very low or even free or negative cost of capital so i'm a bank every time
[02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:42.840]  i lose i'm a big bank every time i lose money you just replenish what i lost
[02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:47.960]  whereas the rest of us have real risk and and we have to pay
[02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:51.320]  a much higher cost of capital than we would if we could just
[02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:58.440]  you know if there was a real market and if you won't sell your business to them
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:02.200]  they put in the green economy which is run by government
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:06.200]  they will selectively force you to sell your business or they will shut you
[02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:09.640]  down well there's thousands of ways it happens but
[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:13.400]  but there's a double standard in terms of regulatory enforcement
[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:17.800]  so for example you know i used to have a broker deal and it was a small company
[02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:22.280]  and before i'd worked on wall street and if you look at the enforcement
[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:27.160]  cost and time that we spend as a small business it was significantly greater
[02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:31.000]  um you know but but but there are double standards
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:35.160]  now let let me describe behind this what one of the
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:42.280]  legitimate problems is um we have a real problem in that right now the
[02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:45.960]  financial markets have two goals you know the goal you're
[02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:49.480]  taught in business school is the goal of the financial markets is to allocate
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:53.080]  capital to the most efficient players and so
[02:17:53.080 --> 02:17:57.080]  you know some companies are efficient and and they make money and so they
[02:17:57.080 --> 02:18:00.200]  attract your you buy their stock as opposed to
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:04.120]  the big bank that has a derivative method goes bankrupt right so
[02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:08.360]  so one is the allocation of capital the other increasingly Alex
[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:12.920]  is geopolitical economic warfare you know we've gone from a planet where
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:18.520]  wars occur with with bombs to where wars occur with derivative bombs
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:24.120]  and and you're literally seeing a sort of a geopolitical
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:27.720]  competition between the chinese the russians and populations around the
[02:18:27.720 --> 02:18:31.720]  globe for resources through the capital markets and so the
[02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:35.720]  the national security goals of manipulating the futures
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:38.440]  market at the price of oil at the price of gold
[02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:44.760]  have have literally overtaken um you know the goal of using the markets for
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:48.200]  whatever and and part of what you're seeing with all the goal of the capital
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:51.800]  control is is literally if you're the government you
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:55.320]  can't afford for people to be making a free market
[02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:58.760]  you need every you know you need the 20 mules to go in this direction because
[02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:01.800]  that's what you need to like manage the chinese
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:05.640]  and so you have this incredible desire for control
[02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:09.160]  including for a legitimate reason and let me tell you what the problem is you
[02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:12.200]  and i have talked many times about the red button problem
[02:19:12.200 --> 02:19:18.200]  which is everybody in america right now we are all the beneficiary of this
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:24.280]  this geopolitical effort so tomorrow if the geopolitics
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:27.880]  and america stopped playing to win at geopolitics and
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:31.240]  we stopped being the global leader in money laundering and we stopped you
[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:34.120]  know stealing from people using derivatives
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:37.320]  what would happen is everybody's government subsidy check would stop and
[02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:41.240]  as of last month americans get more government checks
[02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:44.840]  we get more money from the government than we send to the government tax
[02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:48.200]  yeah i saw that in the new york times stay there and again i've been
[02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:52.920]  interrupting a few times because it's so incredible to see them
[02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:57.000]  openly saying they're going to take over the pension funds
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:02.600]  we're gonna break down where this is going when we come back stay with us
[02:20:02.600 --> 02:20:06.760]  remain in your houses the president of the united states has declared
[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:10.440]  martial law under executive order 11 0004
[02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:14.360]  will they do it will they pull the trigger this time
[02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:19.080]  we all pray they stand down but an engineered crisis seems more likely
[02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:23.000]  with each passing day think it can't happen here
[02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:27.320]  executive order 10 990 locks down all highways
[02:20:27.320 --> 02:20:32.200]  executive order 10 995 seizes control of all media outlets
[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:37.080]  executive order 10 998 controls all farms and food supplies
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:40.760]  all these executive orders are now cocked loaded and waiting
[02:20:40.760 --> 02:20:44.760]  for the right crisis so if you're worried about the possibility of
[02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:48.600]  martial law here in america or have questions about how to survive it go

[02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:15.400]  this reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system
[02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:19.080]  wisdom being lost with time the government we once entrusted to
[02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:22.200]  protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business
[02:21:22.200 --> 02:21:25.560]  creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever
[02:21:25.560 --> 02:21:28.760]  experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an
[02:21:28.760 --> 02:21:32.280]  institution that is not accountable to our elected government but has also
[02:21:32.280 --> 02:21:35.720]  caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value

[02:24:04.600 --> 02:24:08.840]  i want you to listen very carefully to kathryn austin fitz i wanted to go back
[02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:11.960]  over the information she just laid on us and
[02:24:11.960 --> 02:24:16.360]  expand on it they get you dependent on government they take your pension funds
[02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:19.720]  your investment your tax money for the infrastructure they put it in
[02:24:19.720 --> 02:24:23.640]  offshore banks and derivatives that bankrupt people by design
[02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:26.920]  then they come back and say we need even more money and more taxes
[02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:30.600]  to prop all this up when you hear it's for the geopolitical purposes
[02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:35.240]  of the u.s and england europe that's the private banking arms they're feeding on
[02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:40.040]  us but they get us tied into their system where we can't live with it or
[02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:43.240]  without it and now it's coming towards a consolidation
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:45.560]  phase they're going to use phony environmentalism
[02:24:45.560 --> 02:24:49.640]  to bring in a form of neo serfdom or feudalism
[02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:53.640]  to control our lives and now they're showing their true hand
[02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:57.160]  ordering the pension funds to give their money
[02:24:57.160 --> 02:25:02.920]  to the private banks and kathryn austin fitz is a short segment
[02:25:02.920 --> 02:25:09.000]  but please elaborate on the point that you were making
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:14.760]  oh now alex you got me i just finished making the point about the red button
[02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:20.280]  and and the extent to which we are financially dependent
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:25.320]  on global warfare so we're implementing warfare globally whether with military
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:29.320]  warfare with covert opera operations warfare or
[02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:33.880]  increasingly now with this financial warfare and the reality as a system is
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:38.360]  most americans are the financial beneficiary of this sort of
[02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:42.280]  geopolitical warfare and the fact that our currency is very subsidized and
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:46.680]  the red button story is a story i tell where i ask an audience of people
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:50.120]  who will push the red button if it'll stop all hard narcotics traffic in
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:54.520]  their community tomorrow and out of an audience of 100
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:25:58.120]  spiritually committed people to evolving our society spiritually
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:02.280]  99 said they would not push the red button because they don't want their
[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:05.080]  mutual funds to go down or the government checks this up
[02:26:05.080 --> 02:26:10.040]  so we now have an entire society which is financially complicit
[02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:13.640]  in this warfare model and so the question for all of us is
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:17.720]  you know nobody wants the top guys to push the red button because they're
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:21.320]  afraid and as long as we're afraid to push the red
[02:26:21.320 --> 02:26:25.400]  button or to or to engage in a conversation about it you know okay
[02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:28.600]  how do we turn a green how do we make it financially attractive
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:33.640]  then what happens as we go along and and i can say it today you know that they
[02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:38.280]  are doing this but the reality is alex that we are supporting them if you
[02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:42.680]  look at the implementation of all of the sort of police state things
[02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:46.760]  those things are being supported at the local level i mean i've watched all
[02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:50.520]  these things get implemented time after time after time
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:54.520]  and it's you know there's always a group of local people who are helping
[02:26:54.520 --> 02:26:58.200]  promote it it's frightening and so you know but they're doing it because it
[02:26:58.200 --> 02:27:00.840]  makes the money
[02:27:00.840 --> 02:27:05.560]  but to boil it down we're coming to the end
[02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:09.160]  the banks know they've pumped up the Ponzi scheme to such a level
[02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:13.400]  but they're now preparing to rob whatever wealth we've got left and you
[02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:16.120]  talked about how the elites for the last decade
[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:20.440]  have been leaving the united states and now they're not coming to the end
[02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:23.800]  because if you look at the wealth that this planet can
[02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:28.760]  can heart you know create and harvest the amount of wealth has been created
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:32.360]  and can be harvest to date is tiny compared to what you could do in the
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:37.320]  next 20 or 30 years so so they've just you know this is far
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:41.560]  we're on a journey and and the wealth that can be created is far more than
[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:45.000]  exist today to have okay we misunderstand and hold on you
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:48.360]  misunderstand what i'm saying okay they are artificially
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:52.360]  cutting the avenues of wealth off to independent groups
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:56.040]  and smaller organizations and vertically integrating it and saying
[02:27:56.040 --> 02:28:00.840]  they want to cut wealth generation off to people in the west i know they got us
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:04.040]  addicted in right in north america their attitude is
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:07.240]  listen if you all just sit up sit down shut up
[02:28:07.240 --> 02:28:10.280]  you know we put an implant on you and you live on six hundred dollars of
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:14.120]  government subsidy a month it'll make it much easier for us to manage the
[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:17.560]  planet you've created a huge amount of wealth we just stole it all
[02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:20.840]  you're gonna be real unhappy about that so we just want you to sit in the corner
[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:24.840]  and shut up because you know we're on to the next thing
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:29.160]  buy and what is the next thing what is the next thing
[02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:33.320]  well the next thing is they go to a global economy and a global government
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:36.600]  in other words the people managing this in the united states don't see
[02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:41.320]  themselves as americans anymore they see themselves as globalists
[02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:46.280]  and and they're managing to a global operation and in fact if you look at
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:49.960]  where their big investments are their big investments are in space
[02:28:49.960 --> 02:28:53.160]  so in fact you know they're not necessarily even looking at
[02:28:53.160 --> 02:28:58.120]  at planet earth is as the hundred percent base of operations
[02:28:58.120 --> 02:29:01.960]  but but but they have fantastic new technology
[02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:07.480]  and and they have a global framework and and you know their attitude is we've
[02:29:07.480 --> 02:29:11.080]  moved on your left behind and the question is how to manage the end
[02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:14.760]  game i agree now when we come back with
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:18.760]  kathryn austin fits i want you to elaborate on what their end game is
[02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:21.800]  and we were talking during the last break you were saying there are ways to

[02:33:12.840 --> 02:33:15.960]  subject there is the global government the elite
[02:33:15.960 --> 02:33:22.760]  their mindset how they control the planet where they're going
[02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:26.360]  again kathryn austin fitz is the former assistant secretary of housing federal
[02:33:26.360 --> 02:33:31.000]  housing commissioner under bush one the website is salari dot com
[02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:36.920]  s o l a r i dot com excellent info up there
[02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:39.560]  okay i'm gonna try to just sit back and give you the floor because i want you
[02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:41.720]  to give people the overview of who we're dealing with
[02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:46.120]  what their in game is what the next phase of their operations is going to be
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:49.720]  and how we stop them how we get out of this trap
[02:33:49.720 --> 02:33:53.400]  of being dependent on them you notice all they ever want to do is get us more
[02:33:53.400 --> 02:33:55.480]  dependent so that there's
[02:33:55.480 --> 02:33:59.000]  basically no way to get away from these people right
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:02.840]  well it's a company you know that it's just a big
[02:34:02.840 --> 02:34:05.800]  series of about a thousand questions but let me just start
[02:34:05.800 --> 02:34:09.240]  because i think i used to have a pastor in washington who used to say if we can
[02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:13.080]  face it god can fix it and and a lot of the solution is
[02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:16.920]  accelerate alex the day that everyone sits back and says you know these guys are
[02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:21.240]  as nuts as alex jones says they are
[02:34:21.240 --> 02:34:24.280]  because all this stuff about slavery and police state
[02:34:24.280 --> 02:34:27.880]  you know those are reasonable words that is where they're going
[02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:31.160]  and you know i say this is a former regulator a former
[02:34:31.160 --> 02:34:35.400]  assistant secretary of housing a former board member of a wall street firm
[02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:38.600]  a former board member of sally made a student loan
[02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:42.760]  finance organization and let me tell you how i came to that conclusion and
[02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:48.520]  in um you know my part of my background is doing portfolio strategy
[02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:52.760]  for big you know i was the fHA commissioner so doing portfolio strategy
[02:34:52.760 --> 02:34:56.600]  for 300 billion dollars of liabilities and then my company in
[02:34:56.600 --> 02:35:00.760]  washington the hamilton securities group built databases
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:05.160]  of all you know sort of community assets and real estate which is looking at the
[02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:09.080]  entire g&p and then when we compared it to
[02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:12.120]  certain things in the securities and global markets you're talking about the
[02:35:12.120 --> 02:35:17.320]  g&p of the planet so i'm used to dealing in very large numbers and
[02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:22.120]  actuarial analysis so you know and actuarial analysis says well if you
[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:25.480]  stop getting people gmo food they're going to live longer
[02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:28.760]  that means insurance companies are going to have to pay out this much more you
[02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:32.520]  know et cetera et cetera et cetera so so you're used to dealing in very big
[02:35:32.520 --> 02:35:36.840]  numbers in the butterfly effect of of changes in policy
[02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:40.760]  with changes in life span so i give that as a background
[02:35:40.760 --> 02:35:44.760]  and i wrote this in the article i wrote i wrote an essay about why
[02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:48.600]  i i was opposed to the swine flu vaccination
[02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:53.080]  and i literally when i saw the policies that were being implemented in
[02:35:53.080 --> 02:35:57.960]  connection with the rollout of the wto and the control of agribusiness
[02:35:57.960 --> 02:36:02.120]  worldwide um the rounding up of innocent people and
[02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:06.200]  in american communities and stuffed into prison and the private prison property
[02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:09.800]  i went i went through all the different trends from 96 to 98
[02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:13.160]  and i came to the conclusion sort of back of the envelope that the
[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:17.160]  the only thing i could conclude was that
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:21.800]  is that the leadership as a policy was planning on very significant
[02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:26.760]  depopulation worldwide that was the only way i could explain
[02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:31.080]  you know the 20 policies i was seeing being implemented both here and globally
[02:36:31.080 --> 02:36:34.600]  with the wto particularly the control of the food
[02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:38.920]  supply and system with the with sort of what mensanto was doing in
[02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:43.320]  genetically modified food and i was very quiet about it at the time
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:47.000]  you know because i knew other people couldn't fathom what i was saying
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:54.280]  and i remember in 1998 or 99 uh very very savvy portfolio strategist
[02:36:54.280 --> 02:36:57.720]  from the financial community called me up and said can you
[02:36:57.720 --> 02:37:01.080]  have lunch with me i'm going to be in washington and we went to launch a union
[02:37:01.080 --> 02:37:03.720]  station and he looked at me and he said you know
[02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:07.800]  he said i i know this is going to sound crazy but i've done the analysis and if
[02:37:07.800 --> 02:37:10.760]  you look at the changes in policies that are being rolled out
[02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:14.120]  over the last four years the only thing i can conclude is they're planning on
[02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:17.880]  significant depopulation and i said well that's what my analysis
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:21.240]  shows and we just kind of stared at each other
[02:37:21.240 --> 02:37:26.840]  and and if you look across the board at what is being done in terms of
[02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:32.760]  building databases on american citizens what is being done with rfi
[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:39.000]  uh uh you know rfi d or art is it rfi d or art rfdi
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.240]  well they've got a bunch of different ones but let me just stop you for a
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:44.760]  moment okay because you did as you was this huge
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:50.840]  actuary analysts running hundreds of millions of dollars you saw it
[02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:54.680]  like if somebody sees a guy pull up in a van and start casing a house
[02:37:54.680 --> 02:37:59.160]  and then check in the front door you think maybe they're about to try to rob us
[02:37:59.160 --> 02:38:02.920]  i have been at the guy's house as a fly on the wall
[02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:05.960]  and heard him talk about how he's going to rob
[02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:10.840]  and so separately and of course you know all this now it turns out for 50 years
[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:13.720]  they've been planning this and building a world government
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:17.960]  as a means to an end and all of the tracking all of the surveillance all
[02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:21.160]  the police state all the mind control the conditioning
[02:38:21.160 --> 02:38:24.600]  is to be rolled out in phases and we're now coming into the end game
[02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:28.280]  you're coming in to literally kill 80 percent of people
[02:38:28.280 --> 02:38:32.840]  how do we stop this and and again in the phases they shut the resources off
[02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:36.120]  so then you become dependent on government so it has you
[02:38:36.120 --> 02:38:40.520]  in its kill grid the drug the cancer viruses and the shots the mercury
[02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:44.680]  i mean it's all happening i'm sorry go ahead well the food is poisoning us the
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:47.720]  vaccines are poisoning us on and on and on here's
[02:38:47.720 --> 02:38:52.520]  here's the thing to understand theoretically there is a way to stop them
[02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:56.760]  there really is a way to stop them because uh and it's what the poet said
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:39:01.000]  we are we are many they are few and the reality is
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:04.920]  when when will you get a critical mass of people
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:09.160]  facing what's really going on and then when you hit that tipping point what
[02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:13.000]  can they do now step one is you know the key thing to
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:17.720]  understand what everybody has to do is we have to do what gives us energy so
[02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:21.640]  um you know what we all can't do is get in the bus and go to washington today
[02:39:21.640 --> 02:39:24.520]  you know there there are many ideas of what we can do that weighs the huge
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:28.600]  amount of our time and effort that we don't have but step number one you can
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:31.160]  do and it's one that will give you a lot of energy
[02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:34.680]  if you sequence it right it get as far away from them as you
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:38.200]  you possibly can or the people who implement their wishes
[02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:41.960]  in your don't get out of the big cities i i say number one
[02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:45.160]  get to know your neighbors stop watching as much television get healthy
[02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:49.160]  purifier water but more importantly recognize them as the enemy
[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:52.760]  don't just believe peter and austin fits don't just believe alex jones
[02:39:52.760 --> 02:39:55.800]  find out we're telling you the truth and this is life and death
[02:39:55.800 --> 02:39:59.400]  and then the ballgame isn't going to matter so much and take all your energies
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:02.440]  and stop seeing kathryn austin fits as your champion
[02:40:02.440 --> 02:40:05.640]  i stopped seeing alex jones as your champion you know she's not jonah
[02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:08.200]  bach and i'm not going to watch a champion
[02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:12.760]  you're on the uh you know it's really funny and when you withdraw from all
[02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:15.400]  your ideas are great but but you want to get it
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:18.360]  financially not dependent on them as possible
[02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:21.880]  to get as far away as you can from government money or money that they
[02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:26.200]  control one of the things that uh that is just a
[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:30.200]  profoundly important thing if everybody tomorrow in the country
[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:34.440]  alex said you know any bank that's trading derivatives or got
[02:40:34.440 --> 02:40:37.880]  you know big or any of the big banks who got bailout money i'm getting as far away
[02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:41.800]  from as i can so if you pulled your money out of the
[02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:46.600]  um out of the big banks and went to a well managed local bank tomorrow
[02:40:46.600 --> 02:40:50.040]  it would have a profound and dramatic impact
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:53.800]  now you can say well all those banks channel money into wall street anyway
[02:40:53.800 --> 02:40:58.200]  if i'm the federal reserve and i have to negotiate with 25 000 bank presidents
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:00.920]  as opposed to 10 it's a very different picture
[02:41:00.920 --> 02:41:05.080]  it's a very different world okay so anything you can do
[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:08.840]  is it's real funny i have a a member of my network who's
[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:13.160]  uh jewish whose family was really hurt in the holocaust
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:17.080]  and he was asking me whether or not he should bank at a big bank and i said
[02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:20.760]  you know you're basically asking me whether you should you should put your
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:25.240]  money within our money management or not now why are you asking me that question
[02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:28.920]  don't you know that but that's what we're doing we're
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:34.280]  financing if you look at any activist group who's opposed to any of the things
[02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:37.880]  they say they let's say the guys are opposed to gmo
[02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:41.080]  well if you look at where their money is they're all financing the creation of
[02:41:41.080 --> 02:41:44.440]  gmo's and the building of that infrastructure
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:47.720]  when you finance the u.s. government you're financing genetically modified
[02:41:47.720 --> 02:41:51.160]  seed you're financing the implementation of that
[02:41:51.160 --> 02:41:54.680]  so so part of it is you know withdraw as much as you can
[02:41:54.680 --> 02:41:58.600]  your person your family your how you spend your time don't be financially
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:02.200]  dependent but stop financing the very things that are killing you in your
[02:42:02.200 --> 02:42:08.200]  family absolutely now
[02:42:08.200 --> 02:42:12.760]  other solutions uh and i jumped in there when you said get as far away as you
[02:42:12.760 --> 02:42:15.560]  can money here's the next solution who are you
[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:20.760]  supporting for sheriff this this in this uh local election
[02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:24.120]  okay if thirty one hundred counties the sheriff
[02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:27.720]  there's dual sovereignty under the constitution
[02:42:27.720 --> 02:42:32.040]  so so your sheriff can literally tell the the federal government
[02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:36.600]  to get off you know your county property and know they may not enforce
[02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:39.480]  something that is outside the tenth amendment
[02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:43.240]  okay so so we're coming into election the election cycle
[02:42:43.240 --> 02:42:46.520]  and the election cycle is always a time alex when you can be talking to your
[02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:50.280]  neighbors about all these issues and let me tell you something the fact that
[02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:54.600]  the bailouts and health care passed without having any kind of popular
[02:42:54.600 --> 02:42:57.880]  sufficient popular support for a change of that
[02:42:57.880 --> 02:43:01.720]  extraordinary nature has got people worked up and they're ready to have a
[02:43:01.720 --> 02:43:05.080]  conversation so so number one you want to get into
[02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:08.280]  office the right kind of sheriff and you want your sheriff
[02:43:08.280 --> 02:43:11.560]  is your sheriff out there doing crime patrol
[02:43:11.560 --> 02:43:15.320]  or is your sheriff instead spending all of your taxed monies
[02:43:15.320 --> 02:43:19.400]  foreclosing on people on behalf of the big bank and trying to squeeze people
[02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:23.000]  and raise revenue we've always promoted patriot sheriff so we're on the same
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:27.720]  page right on that front thing is in your state local areas
[02:43:27.720 --> 02:43:32.280]  you have candidates who are who are proposing tenth amendment legislation
[02:43:32.280 --> 02:43:35.560]  so for example Idaho passed the health freedom act
[02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:39.320]  we have lots of states trying to pass health freedom act
[02:43:39.320 --> 02:43:44.600]  we have lots of states um uh you know doing a variety of things on the tenth
[02:43:44.600 --> 02:43:47.800]  amendment there's a great tenth amendment center online
[02:43:47.800 --> 02:43:51.560]  so you want to find out where the state local representatives who are active on
[02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:54.040]  tenth amendment and you want to get hooked up
[02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:58.440]  and supporting them okay but the number one message here is
[02:43:58.440 --> 02:44:01.720]  get up don't just count on other people to do it now
[02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:04.680]  i want to get into some other issues if we talk about some more solutions here
[02:44:04.680 --> 02:44:07.800]  but also talk about what their in game is
[02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:11.320]  studying these larger okay so can i mention one other thing
[02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:15.480]  go ahead stop giving them your data
[02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:19.080]  there's an edwin black have you ever had edwin black on
[02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:22.680]  yes black wrote the book about ibm building the database and computer
[02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:27.960]  systems for the holocaust yes okay well any any kind of police
[02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:31.880]  state or any kind of slavery depends seriously
[02:44:31.880 --> 02:44:35.640]  on having the infrastructure you need the database
[02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:39.800]  and and computer infrastructure you need to manage large
[02:44:39.800 --> 02:44:43.640]  population so it's just like if you're a farmer and you have livestock
[02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:46.920]  you need great data and great databases if you're going to manage the
[02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:50.840]  population ditto here and what we're watching
[02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:55.160]  in the health care bill in a variety of different legislations and policies
[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:58.200]  and now with the census is the effort to build
[02:44:58.200 --> 02:45:01.960]  the definitive database infrastructure um
[02:45:01.960 --> 02:45:06.360]  that will allow them to define where you live who you live with
[02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:09.960]  connect up your health care databases connect up your
[02:45:09.960 --> 02:45:14.040]  tax information if they want to connect up all sorts of private
[02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:17.480]  commercial information they have about your spending habits
[02:45:17.480 --> 02:45:21.240]  use art is what this bill does it says the iris looks at the health care you're
[02:45:21.240 --> 02:45:25.640]  getting to take money out of your savings account medical savings account
[02:45:25.640 --> 02:45:29.000]  uh... you were talking about how they're putting in new laws
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.880]  to track all your money or not let you get your money out of the country
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:34.600]  the elites already pulled their money out now they want to make sure the
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:37.720]  middle class has to stay here and basically be sucked right
[02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:41.160]  right so what you want to do the first thing you want to do is you want to get
[02:45:41.160 --> 02:45:44.200]  your data out of the system stop giving them data
[02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:47.640]  okay and and there are lots of different ways you can do that
[02:45:47.640 --> 02:45:50.840]  and then the second thing you want to do is you want to get out of the money
[02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:55.560]  system as much as possible anyway so so anything you can do to protect
[02:45:55.560 --> 02:45:59.480]  to not make yourself a target you know we can
[02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:04.200]  we can put our money in a stock get a dividend and then go buy water from the
[02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:08.200]  water company but also if we live in a rural area we can just stop being in
[02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:10.760]  the middle and we can go out and build a well
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:14.200]  and then i don't need your stock and i don't need your dividend and that's why
[02:46:14.200 --> 02:46:18.360]  they're moving nationwide and worldwide to block people drilling their own wells
[02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:22.120]  well that's why so you want to be you if you can you want to live in an area where
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:25.880]  you still have the power to do that okay we're running out of time it's clear i've
[02:46:25.880 --> 02:46:29.240]  got to have you back up for a full hour just on solutions
[02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:32.360]  uh those are all great solutions i number one say
[02:46:32.360 --> 02:46:36.440]  wake people up they're ready to be woken up to the full horror
[02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:40.200]  but looking at their program and and being able to factor in all these
[02:46:40.200 --> 02:46:44.520]  different elements on a wide spectrum analysis what do you see as
[02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:48.120]  their game plan in the next six months to a year to two years
[02:46:48.120 --> 02:46:52.760]  out to five years how do you see them unrolling this global financial takeover
[02:46:52.760 --> 02:46:56.440]  and then we'll dovetail that with this war making economy
[02:46:56.440 --> 02:47:00.680]  that isn't just launching wars overseas naked body scanners surveillance
[02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:05.640]  face scanners cps dinecore out grabbing more children for no reason
[02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:08.120]  the texas case where they're taking people's kids now
[02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:11.720]  if their parents say don't trust the government i mean it's getting crazy
[02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:14.920]  right now it's well it's been crazy for a long time
[02:47:14.920 --> 02:47:18.520]  but it's going to become very crazy to most people and and i think what you
[02:47:18.520 --> 02:47:22.440]  need to do is first and foremost you need to know
[02:47:22.440 --> 02:47:26.760]  that that if you are awake and out to protect yourself
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:30.680]  they can't do this and so the question is what the step number one everybody
[02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:34.600]  has to do is turn off their tv and stop
[02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:38.040]  listening to their media and stay linked into media that's telling you the
[02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:40.920]  truth that's step number one because because the first
[02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:45.160]  way they control you alexis with your mind so the first step is get your mind
[02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:48.360]  clean don't let them control your mind
[02:47:48.360 --> 02:47:52.760]  well i mean how can a cop take a family's
[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:57.800]  child and put on the cps form they taught their children not to trust the
[02:47:57.800 --> 02:48:00.360]  government i mean that's right out of 1984
[02:48:00.360 --> 02:48:04.040]  and these cops feel good while they're doing this i mean these are
[02:48:04.040 --> 02:48:08.520]  tyrants i've seen this in my own situation when i was targeted
[02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:12.840]  every team we had 18 audits and investigations at the hamilton securities
[02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:15.800]  group and when it when each one started the people
[02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:20.280]  coming into audit investigate thought we were you know just bad horrible people
[02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:23.400]  and then we'd work with them and before it was over they'd be on our side
[02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:27.480]  against the government but but initially they
[02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:31.160]  they are taught to believe that you're bad people and and the problem is most
[02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:34.520]  people get defensive and don't work through it we were
[02:48:34.520 --> 02:48:38.120]  trained in spiritual warfare so we saw it as our job to bring them
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:43.480]  across to the light and usually dead and so um you know they really don't know
[02:48:43.480 --> 02:48:48.680]  and it's hard alex for you to fathom that the system is that ugly or that evil
[02:48:48.680 --> 02:48:53.960]  they really don't know many of them so we got it we gotta turn them around
[02:48:53.960 --> 02:48:58.520]  when you saw our article last friday cops and cps sees child from parent for
[02:48:58.520 --> 02:49:01.800]  miscrusting government i was aware of this but you sent me a
[02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:05.080]  lot of stuff that i actually wasn't aware of uh... that and we're gonna be
[02:49:05.080 --> 02:49:09.320]  showing people some document and shots right now uh... with uh... dine core
[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:11.160]  heavily involved
[02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:14.600]  uh... globally it's been congressional hearings in in white slavery child
[02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:17.240]  kidnapping rings they now have a new name
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:21.880]  uh... but uh... csc dine core and i think you can see and then they got
[02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:25.240]  spun off and went public but they're back to their old name
[02:49:25.240 --> 02:49:29.320]  okay so but but i mean i have all the mainstream news articles
[02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:32.840]  this is literally a legion of doom and that's all part of their military
[02:49:32.840 --> 02:49:36.280]  operation and grabbing kids is very lucrative well
[02:49:36.280 --> 02:49:40.040]  the scary story in the world and one that's hard for most people get into
[02:49:40.040 --> 02:49:45.240]  is the role of pedophilia and pedophilia is a very old story alex it's been
[02:49:45.240 --> 02:49:47.080]  used for years
[02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:51.560]  you know as a both uh... you know a personnel benefit if you will and it
[02:49:51.560 --> 02:49:55.720]  and a form of entrapment once you get a file you know what once you get dirty
[02:49:55.720 --> 02:49:58.920]  pictures of somebody engaged in pedophilia politician or business
[02:49:58.920 --> 02:50:02.680]  leader you want to play with one of the most economic ways to control
[02:50:02.680 --> 02:50:05.480]  there is i hate to say it but that's the reality
[02:50:05.480 --> 02:50:08.840]  if you look at the history of narcotics trafficking and mortgage fraud in this
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:13.640]  country it's intimately linked with with pedophilia sex slavery you know i
[02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:18.120]  just hate to say it that's the way it is and i got on to dinecore in the 90s
[02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:21.080]  because you had a couple of whistleblowers um
[02:50:21.080 --> 02:50:25.960]  when dinecore was a government contract they you had their project managers
[02:50:25.960 --> 02:50:29.640]  literally engaged in owning you know buying and owning children and using
[02:50:29.640 --> 02:50:33.960]  them for sex and and and working with the local mafia's who were who were
[02:50:33.960 --> 02:50:36.600]  tracking it and yet the state department
[02:50:36.600 --> 02:50:39.800]  where dinecore is the biggest contract was forgiving all of us anyway this is
[02:50:39.800 --> 02:50:43.560]  all on the public record and then dinecore started to pop up and show
[02:50:43.560 --> 02:50:46.600]  protective services contracts around the country
[02:50:46.600 --> 02:50:49.880]  and we were in a tough time stay there stay there i'm gonna have to have you
[02:50:49.880 --> 02:50:52.840]  back for a full hour soon on the subject because
[02:50:52.840 --> 02:50:55.480]  i actually got death threats when i first heard of covering this about eight

[02:54:37.480 --> 02:54:42.200]  and again the magnitude of the evil and dinecore
[02:54:42.200 --> 02:54:45.160]  i know some of us but she sent me a link to news articles
[02:54:45.160 --> 02:54:48.440]  and government purchase orders where they're involved all over
[02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:51.720]  warehousing the kids once they're taken so now
[02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:54.760]  it's not enough to grab iraqi kids or serve kids now they're grabbing our
[02:54:54.760 --> 02:54:58.600]  kids katharine finish your story okay so so i'm
[02:54:58.600 --> 02:55:02.440]  uh... the way i got onto this was i was
[02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:06.760]  in washington and i i had come on to dinecore because of their role in the
[02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:11.480]  war on drugs and i'll tell you two stories the first
[02:55:11.480 --> 02:55:15.880]  was a group of peasant women from south america came up to
[02:55:15.880 --> 02:55:20.520]  to give a presentation to congressman and they gave a presentation in washington
[02:55:20.520 --> 02:55:25.000]  on how um they were being moved off their land
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:28.120]  private people were picking up their land for cheap and then the government
[02:55:28.120 --> 02:55:31.720]  was building housing and you know this whole war on
[02:55:31.720 --> 02:55:35.080]  drugs game and so i kept asking them questions and finally they got very
[02:55:35.080 --> 02:55:38.600]  suspicious and said how come you know so much about how the money
[02:55:38.600 --> 02:55:42.920]  works in our country and i said well i was the assistant secretary of housing
[02:55:42.920 --> 02:55:47.080]  and apparently it works the same way in your country that works at ours
[02:55:47.080 --> 02:55:50.760]  so afterwards i did a little research and discovered the same
[02:55:50.760 --> 02:55:57.320]  contractor in enforcement at HUD in this country was the lead contractor in
[02:55:57.320 --> 02:55:59.960]  latin america in the war on drugs it was dinecore
[02:55:59.960 --> 02:56:03.880]  so i started to get in and look at dinecore and on and on and on and
[02:56:03.880 --> 02:56:08.360]  and that's when the story of the sex slave trafficking came out and it was
[02:56:08.360 --> 02:56:12.920]  unbelievable because insight magazine alex wrote a great story about sex
[02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:17.880]  slave trafficking the allegations in connection with the dinecore litigation
[02:56:17.880 --> 02:56:23.080]  those magazines cover story were dropped on every
[02:56:23.080 --> 02:56:27.960]  senator in every congressman's uh desk and the next week both the navy and the
[02:56:27.960 --> 02:56:31.400]  state department gave huge new contracts to dinecore
[02:56:31.400 --> 02:56:34.840]  you know so it didn't seem to matter was quite amazing
[02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:38.680]  anyway so so fast forward i i ended up writing a series of
[02:56:38.680 --> 02:56:43.880]  stories about dinecore and illuminating what was going on because in fact
[02:56:43.880 --> 02:56:48.040]  the chairman of the finance committee at enron
[02:56:48.040 --> 02:56:52.280]  um was a private investor who was the chairman a lead investor for many years
[02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:55.480]  in dinecore and the linkages between dinecore and some
[02:56:55.480 --> 02:56:59.240]  of what was going on with the funny money was pretty scary
[02:56:59.240 --> 02:57:04.440]  so um when our litigation was very hot and heavy
[02:57:04.440 --> 02:57:08.120]  i and of course dinecore was a big contractor at the department of justice
[02:57:08.120 --> 02:57:12.200]  and was said by the inslaw people to be one of the managers of the
[02:57:12.200 --> 02:57:16.840]  promise software anyway so we're in the middle of litigation and i have a person
[02:57:16.840 --> 02:57:20.200]  one of the people working for me helping me do the
[02:57:20.200 --> 02:57:23.640]  litigation support work which was very time-consuming
[02:57:23.640 --> 02:57:28.840]  came to me and said you know um uh somebody from child protective services
[02:57:28.840 --> 02:57:33.640]  showed up at my house and uh she she's an old you know she's a
[02:57:33.640 --> 02:57:37.480]  single mom we got a minute and a half left to finish up on this and so she
[02:57:37.480 --> 02:57:40.760]  said i'm sure it's a mistake and i said no no no this is dangerous we need to
[02:57:40.760 --> 02:57:45.800]  research find out if dinecore is is the contractor for child
[02:57:45.800 --> 02:57:49.960]  protective services sure enough they were and we literally had to get her to
[02:57:49.960 --> 02:57:54.760]  move to another state and this is a child molestation army so
[02:57:54.760 --> 02:57:57.960]  well but but what what you need to but so last
[02:57:57.960 --> 02:58:01.800]  last week when i saw what was going on texas i said you want to check and see
[02:58:01.800 --> 02:58:05.080]  whether dinecore is behind you know is in the mix
[02:58:05.080 --> 02:58:08.120]  because the idea of going after people's children just because they
[02:58:08.120 --> 02:58:12.440]  disagree with government policy this is a real risk
[02:58:12.440 --> 02:58:15.080]  this is pure able to you had one more point you wanted to make
[02:58:15.080 --> 02:58:20.200]  yes i just wanted to thank you alex you sent two of your incredible producers

[03:03:35.560 --> 03:03:38.920]  same corporation that did the bond proposal and built the harden
[03:03:38.920 --> 03:03:41.240]  twenty eight million dollar facility that no one

[03:08:34.840 --> 03:08:40.840]  joseph watson at prison pilot dot com and info wars dot com pop construction firm wtc
[03:08:41.400 --> 03:08:49.000]  destroyed by controlled demolition now remember just a month ago back on uh april 23rd the headline
[03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:56.040]  bombshell silberstein wanted to demolish building seven on 911 that is from fox news
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:01.560]  but the fox news reporter said i was there that day i was with silberstein and the emergency
[03:09:01.560 --> 03:09:06.200]  management people and yes they did say they were looking at wiring and blowing up seven
[03:09:06.200 --> 03:09:10.440]  but magically it fell on its own so we didn't have to blow it up well it takes weeks of not
[03:09:10.440 --> 03:09:15.240]  months to properly demolish a 47-story building a few years ago they tried to blow up the intel
[03:09:15.240 --> 03:09:21.400]  building in austin a top firm did it failed intel in the late nineties during the dot
[03:09:21.400 --> 03:09:26.760]  com bus finished the skeleton of the building then it collapsed the dot com bubble so that
[03:09:26.760 --> 03:09:31.480]  they never finished it but they couldn't even blow up the skeleton of it on the first tribe
[03:09:31.480 --> 03:09:36.840]  the superstructure and then we have all the police and fireman footage i'm not gonna
[03:09:36.840 --> 03:09:40.920]  go back over today we may play some where the cops are saying get back get back get back we're
[03:09:40.920 --> 03:09:47.160]  gonna blow it up we're gonna blow up seven and i remember being in the car that day i've been
[03:09:47.160 --> 03:09:53.080]  on air all day i ran out of the studio to get a pizza literally a half mile away to scarf it
[03:09:53.080 --> 03:09:59.880]  i was scarfing it in the car as i was driving back to go back on air and they were on abc news
[03:09:59.880 --> 03:10:04.680]  saying they they're they're going to blow up building seven and then i talked about it and
[03:10:04.680 --> 03:10:08.360]  people said you're a conspiracy theorist well it turns out there's scores of newscast now
[03:10:08.360 --> 03:10:13.640]  including bbc where they did a false script and announced that it had fallen in its own
[03:10:13.640 --> 03:10:19.960]  footprint 25 minutes before it did so look there's no doubt folks they blew up building seven
[03:10:19.960 --> 03:10:26.040]  we had Barry Jennings the deputy head of new york emergency management on uh two weeks later he
[03:10:26.040 --> 03:10:33.160]  died mysteriously uh and uh he was getting threats and he said yeah they blew up building seven
[03:10:33.160 --> 03:10:37.960]  so this isn't a game we're playing i mean i hope you understand that now you can debate who
[03:10:37.960 --> 03:10:43.880]  carried out 9-11 who had you know the means opportunity uh the motive uh and who thought
[03:10:43.880 --> 03:10:50.280]  they could get away with it and that's the western power structure no one else that's england the
[03:10:50.280 --> 03:10:55.640]  us israel they're all joined at the hip but for the next hour and a little bit into the next
[03:10:55.640 --> 03:11:02.360]  hour than bob chatman's joining us uh allen heart joins us uh because he's another window into this
[03:11:02.360 --> 03:11:07.240]  you know you have this fox news reporter going with the lies saying yeah okay we were there they
[03:11:07.240 --> 03:11:13.080]  were talking about blowing it up but we didn't so your conspiracy theorist forever saying we did
[03:11:14.280 --> 03:11:17.800]  and then you've got all the firemen's you know saying yeah they told us they blew it up
[03:11:17.800 --> 03:11:21.480]  and then they get fired or threatened and the cops saying yeah they said they blew it up
[03:11:21.480 --> 03:11:25.480]  i've interviewed those cops bartender and others i've gone and found the cops who were on the
[03:11:25.480 --> 03:11:31.000]  scene in video saying get back they're bringing it down folks we have the live footage get back
[03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:37.640]  they're blowing it up and then again the cops weren't involved they were brought into it and
[03:11:37.640 --> 03:11:43.160]  then once they've accepted it i they just engage in crime stopper double think and then they don't
[03:11:43.160 --> 03:11:47.160]  talk about it but but i'm gonna shut up it's just to to get into building seven to get into 9-11 to
[03:11:47.160 --> 03:11:52.360]  get into the norweg stand down to to get into us and british troops mass in and around afghanistan

[03:13:12.920 --> 03:13:18.360]  got such a lengthy bio uh you know it'd be like talking about muhammad ali's boxing career you
[03:13:18.360 --> 03:13:21.640]  know that would take an hour to just hit the highlights but for those that don't know who
[03:13:21.640 --> 03:13:26.840]  alan hart is and the websites alan hart dot net tell us about your career what you've done and
[03:13:27.400 --> 03:13:32.360]  why you're going public now well alex first of all let me say i'm delighted to become a member
[03:13:32.360 --> 03:13:37.240]  of your truth-telling society if i can put it like that and i'd like to tell you why in two
[03:13:37.240 --> 03:13:44.440]  sentences when i became a very young reporter with independent television news more than 40 years ago
[03:13:44.440 --> 03:13:52.360]  my editor-in-chief gave me an omission statement in one short sentence quote our job is to help
[03:13:52.360 --> 03:14:01.800]  keep democracy alive unquote and my take today um alex is quite simple the mainstream media has
[03:14:01.800 --> 03:14:07.640]  betrayed democracy i suspect you might go along with that too yeah they certainly have they've
[03:14:07.640 --> 03:14:13.000]  been part of the complete overthrow of our society okay well alex my background is i've
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:19.560]  been in uh uh uh journalism and i i've been doing secret politics in the middle east for the best
[03:14:19.560 --> 03:14:27.800]  part of 40 years i have two uh claims to frame in a sense i am the only person on earth i think
[03:14:28.360 --> 03:14:35.400]  who enjoyed intimate access to and on the human level friendship with the two greatest opposites
[03:14:35.400 --> 03:14:42.600]  in all of human history go to maya mother israel and yes our father palestine i think there's
[03:14:42.600 --> 03:14:49.000]  nobody else on the planet who can say that my other claim to fame is that you know the first
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:56.600]  rule of journalism alex if you offend both parties to a dispute uh or or a conflict you're probably
[03:14:56.600 --> 03:15:06.280]  on the right track yes well i am red flagged by zionism and the regimes of an impotent corrupt
[03:15:06.280 --> 03:15:12.120]  repressive arab order both of those who've been flagged because i guess i'm on the right track
[03:15:12.120 --> 03:15:19.560]  so basically what i bring to the table is 40 years of experience of covering the world in general
[03:15:19.560 --> 03:15:25.320]  the middle east in particular and i should add that i started to grow up as a person as a young
[03:15:25.320 --> 03:15:32.760]  reporter in vietnam there i was watching america spending six million dollars a minute destroying
[03:15:32.760 --> 03:15:38.680]  two countries north and south vietnam on a war it could not win and should not afford it was there
[03:15:38.680 --> 03:15:45.400]  that i started to say to myself what the hell is this world all about amazing and again you're
[03:15:45.400 --> 03:15:52.360]  you're uh being um you know meek about your amazing career sir and we appreciate you joining us
[03:15:52.360 --> 03:15:56.600]  well we'll talk about some of the books that you written before you leave us but let's plunge
[03:15:56.600 --> 03:16:03.400]  into it now why have you decided to come out and you know lay out the fact uh that the media is
[03:16:03.400 --> 03:16:08.600]  self-censoring and that you talked to one of the biggest construction firms in the world and that
[03:16:08.600 --> 03:16:13.160]  they did their own analysis and concluded it was controlled demolition okay well let's go
[03:16:13.160 --> 03:16:20.200]  head on to that to alex first of all i am not a latecomer to the truth of 9 11 i've been aware
[03:16:20.200 --> 03:16:26.200]  of the truth uh since a very few days after the dreadful event happened but the point is this
[03:16:26.760 --> 03:16:32.680]  when i was completing my latest book it's an epic journey in three volumes through the lies and
[03:16:32.680 --> 03:16:37.480]  truth of history as it relates to the making and sustaining of the conflict in and over Palestine
[03:16:37.480 --> 03:16:43.640]  that became Israel i censored myself on the subject of 9 11 because i didn't want to give
[03:16:43.640 --> 03:16:51.400]  supporters of Israel right or wrong the ammunition to dismiss me as a mad conspiracy theory because
[03:16:51.400 --> 03:16:57.960]  of my views on 9 11 in order to divert attention away from all the other truth i reveal in my book
[03:16:57.960 --> 03:17:04.520]  i think you'll understand what i'm saying yes i understand okay so here i am in america uh i
[03:17:04.520 --> 03:17:10.840]  didn't interview with uh with another talk show host that uh i i respect kevin barrett yes he asked
[03:17:10.840 --> 03:17:16.760]  about 9 11 so i thought hell the book the book's published volume three of the American edition
[03:17:16.760 --> 03:17:22.600]  is coming in uh in a very few days so i decided that the time had come to end my own silence and
[03:17:22.600 --> 03:17:30.120]  the point is this what i think about 9 11 as an individual is not important it's what people that
[03:17:30.120 --> 03:17:36.920]  i've learned to respect think now i have many friends in in all walks of life politics business
[03:17:36.920 --> 03:17:44.520]  you name it and it so happens that two of my dearest friends are world leading consultants
[03:17:44.520 --> 03:17:51.320]  civil engineering consultants or one of the greatest civil engineering and project management firms
[03:17:51.320 --> 03:17:56.920]  in the world i'm not going to name it pick your business can either believe me or not because
[03:17:56.920 --> 03:18:02.920]  the research they did for me uh studying all the films and everything else they did for me
[03:18:02.920 --> 03:18:07.960]  privately well you're a renowned journalist uh an award-winning so that i mean that's standard
[03:18:07.960 --> 03:18:11.960]  for those that don't know they're not reveal your sources you don't want to throw them overboard
[03:18:11.960 --> 03:18:18.360]  i mean they did this in confidence but continue okay so so here we are they are truly a world
[03:18:18.360 --> 03:18:25.080]  leading consultant and they they said to me when they studied the film footage and everything else
[03:18:25.080 --> 03:18:31.800]  alan it is irrefutable the building uh the twin towers were brought down by controlled
[03:18:31.800 --> 03:18:37.320]  explosions from within now i know there are many other people that say that in america but as a
[03:18:37.320 --> 03:18:45.080]  journalist i can only go on people that i know and trust right yes uh so they send that to me so
[03:18:45.080 --> 03:18:51.480]  by definition alex if the buildings were brought down by controlled explosions it is a conspiracy
[03:18:51.480 --> 03:18:59.160]  by absolute definition so then you have to take it wider now my speculation and of course it is
[03:18:59.160 --> 03:19:08.120]  speculation is that it probably may well have started out as an all muslim conspiracy but the
[03:19:08.120 --> 03:19:16.920]  thing is ever since israel's foundation its various intelligence agencies must add in particular
[03:19:16.920 --> 03:19:23.640]  and its directors of military intelligence have been brilliant and they've had agents deep inside
[03:19:24.200 --> 03:19:29.000]  every hour of government every hour of military or sir we've got a break there we've got a break
[03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:33.800]  i apologize i'm not going to cut you off for a single second we get back and we'll run through

[03:24:10.440 --> 03:24:15.240]  alan heart is a author former middle east chief correspondent for independent television news
[03:24:15.240 --> 03:24:23.000]  former bbc anorama presenter and the list goes on and on started out his beat during the
[03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:29.000]  vietnam war over there okay this is a short segment you got caught off by the break please
[03:24:30.120 --> 03:24:35.160]  start back over with with the information you were covering concerning 911 right to pick up
[03:24:35.160 --> 03:24:41.480]  where we were alex and it's not impossible and this is my speculation it's not impossible it
[03:24:41.480 --> 03:24:48.600]  started out as an all muslim plot but even if it did it would have been very quickly taken over
[03:24:48.600 --> 03:24:55.080]  by israeli agents i mean one of the great truths of history is that from almost the moment of israel's
[03:24:55.080 --> 03:25:01.880]  birth israeli agents either mothat or the directors of military intelligence penetrated
[03:25:01.880 --> 03:25:07.720]  every arab government every arab military organization every arab terrorist group whether
[03:25:07.720 --> 03:25:13.480]  they were terrorists or not and if we time later on ask me to tell you this particular story the
[03:25:13.480 --> 03:25:20.120]  penetration of the abu nidal group but for now let's say even if it started out as an all muslim
[03:25:20.120 --> 03:25:26.280]  plot um israeli agents inside would have got to know about it and my guess is that they would
[03:25:26.280 --> 03:25:33.800]  have said to the bad guys in the cia and their associates zionist associates and other neocon
[03:25:33.800 --> 03:25:40.600]  associates hey this plot is running what do we do with it and the answer would have been we'll
[03:25:40.600 --> 03:25:47.480]  use it because we know in the background that paul wolfowitz had already spoken in his paper the
[03:25:47.480 --> 03:25:55.080]  clean break about the need for a pearl harbor event right yes the peanut documents that's right
[03:25:55.800 --> 03:26:04.200]  so the zionist and the neocons uh they were looking for a pearl harbor event uh to give them
[03:26:04.200 --> 03:26:10.680]  the pretext to go to war not only in uh in uh iraq to get rid of saddam hussein but the the
[03:26:10.680 --> 03:26:17.560]  clean break document that the zionist in america wrote for incoming prime minister nathan yahoo
[03:26:17.560 --> 03:26:24.920]  in his first term talked about the need not only to get rid of saddam hussein but to roll bacteria
[03:26:24.920 --> 03:26:31.640]  and eventually go for iran which we now see happening uh i want to continue fleshing this out
[03:26:31.640 --> 03:26:37.240]  from your experience and reporting for decades from the middle east and interviewing yasser harrafat
[03:26:37.240 --> 03:26:41.720]  and you know just countless other people and as you said earlier the founder of the modern state
[03:26:41.720 --> 03:26:46.520]  of israel i believe you were saying you consider to be a friend that is so interesting i want to
[03:26:46.520 --> 03:26:51.480]  discuss that and i mean it must be painful to have to you know talk about this and go over this
[03:26:52.120 --> 03:26:58.760]  because the truth is painful i'm only looking for the truth and a lot of the people that
[03:26:58.760 --> 03:27:04.360]  constantly attack israel in my experience make stuff up a hyperventilate it's a religion of
[03:27:04.360 --> 03:27:10.760]  hating israel uh they lie about me they lie about others so i don't have any respect for them
[03:27:10.760 --> 03:27:17.080]  but somebody like you who does have you know a great track record and uh who i have researched
[03:27:17.080 --> 03:27:22.520]  uh you know that's why you're here on the show and that's why we're we're talking about this and
[03:27:22.520 --> 03:27:27.240]  i you know you do believe at certain levels israel was involved in 911 we know that there were high
[03:27:27.240 --> 03:27:35.160]  jackers uh that were living in homes paid for by israeli intelligence we know fox news even reported
[03:27:35.160 --> 03:27:40.520]  that hundreds of israeli spies were arrested in around 911 uh i've interviewed the sheriff
[03:27:41.240 --> 03:27:47.160]  who picked up the dancing israelis who later turned out were misad uh and we do know the
[03:27:47.160 --> 03:27:52.600]  moving company was a misad front we do know they were videotaping it we know silverstein is tied in
[03:27:52.600 --> 03:27:58.280]  uh to all these groups uh but then you've got separately cheney in there in control of the
[03:27:58.280 --> 03:28:02.600]  stand down we know we we have a stand down order from two months before i called cheney doctor
[03:28:02.600 --> 03:28:09.720]  the real doctor strange love incident incident well then i mean speak to that because i'm always
[03:28:09.720 --> 03:28:15.960]  worried about anything that says it's one group or another group when you point out rightly that
[03:28:15.960 --> 03:28:21.640]  that let me take adam gadan the grandson of the adl former head up there putting up fake al-qaeda
[03:28:21.640 --> 03:28:26.280]  videos the cia admits they're putting out fake bin laden videos now in washington post i mean
[03:28:26.280 --> 03:28:31.480]  that is clearly a israeli production without him to don to menace and scare the american people so
[03:28:31.480 --> 03:28:36.760]  as i'm all about you know exposing things i've just found the british stage terror the us stage
[03:28:36.760 --> 03:28:42.280]  terror uh and so i want to speak about that because uh you i mean you're saying israel
[03:28:42.280 --> 03:28:48.440]  found out about it and then said hey this is going on let's piggyback uh or or or piggyback on it
[03:28:48.440 --> 03:28:52.200]  but but for me it's more than just piggybacking that these governments
[03:28:52.200 --> 03:28:56.840]  at every level were involved shepherding the operation but i think there are so many other
[03:28:56.840 --> 03:29:03.080]  things i mean look for goodness sake there has been a complete cover-up in this country authorized
[03:29:03.080 --> 03:29:09.720]  by president johnson of israel's attack on the liberty during the 1967 war absolutely we don't
[03:29:09.720 --> 03:29:16.680]  actually know who killed kennedy now in my view oswald didn't fire a shot oh the evidence is overwhelming
[03:29:16.680 --> 03:29:25.000]  um so you know america has uh an incredible tradition at leadership level in suppressing the
[03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:32.440]  truth and the question you have to ask surely is in whose interest is it that american citizens
[03:29:32.440 --> 03:29:39.880]  the voters be denied the truth about so much so for you it it's all motive you you believe

[03:35:03.720 --> 03:35:11.960]  three one three nine now going back to our guest alan hardt again author former chief
[03:35:11.960 --> 03:35:18.600]  correspondent for independent television and bbc uh expert on the middle east you got cut off you
[03:35:18.600 --> 03:35:24.200]  were trying to clarify something that i was speaking about dealing with stage terror and
[03:35:24.200 --> 03:35:31.640]  nine eleven go ahead yeah i wasn't quite saying that only israel and zionist had had motivation
[03:35:31.640 --> 03:35:39.480]  because that you know the network is israel the zionist supporters here but the whole of the neocons
[03:35:39.480 --> 03:35:44.840]  who are summer zionist summer not summer plain old fashion american americans like dick cheney
[03:35:44.840 --> 03:35:50.280]  but also there is this alliance with the christian fundamentalist the so-called christian zionist
[03:35:51.000 --> 03:35:58.600]  now i think frankly and i think i've never said this before publicly i think that what that alliance
[03:35:58.600 --> 03:36:06.920]  actually wants is a clash of civilizations judeo christian b islamic i think that's what they
[03:36:06.920 --> 03:36:13.160]  would really like to provoke and that's why they let him build a giant mosque on the ruins of nine
[03:36:13.160 --> 03:36:21.000]  eleven that's why it turned out it was an intel opt doing the uh... mohammed cartoons with him with
[03:36:21.000 --> 03:36:26.760]  a bomb on his head uh... two two well they say they want a clash of civilizations in the peanut
[03:36:26.760 --> 03:36:32.120]  documents yeah but you just use the word which i'd like to pick up on the phrase police state
[03:36:32.680 --> 03:36:39.080]  now you know we had a prime minister called edward he's not too long ago soon after he left office
[03:36:39.080 --> 03:36:46.840]  my wife and i had lunch with him and i said uh... mister he's what is your biggest fear for the
[03:36:46.840 --> 03:36:52.920]  future remember this is a british prime minister i thought he would talk about global poverty
[03:36:52.920 --> 03:36:59.480]  because he had been involved with it as i had but he didn't he said that britain will become the
[03:36:59.480 --> 03:37:05.880]  first police state in the so-called democratic world now this is the guy who's been prime minister
[03:37:05.880 --> 03:37:11.160]  who knows how the system works and he's telling me that he fears britain will become the first
[03:37:11.160 --> 03:37:18.360]  police state no doubt you've read alex george all was 1984 yeah yes that's what he envisioned
[03:37:18.360 --> 03:37:25.640]  coming to fruition in england if things weren't reversing i go further alex i think the western
[03:37:25.640 --> 03:37:33.000]  world is on that road and well on it you see i don't think democracy exists anywhere in the world
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:40.840]  because before it to exist citizens voters have to be informed enough about issues to participate
[03:37:40.840 --> 03:37:46.760]  in in debate and to be able to no i agree it's it's it's it's manufactured consent it's insoc
[03:37:46.760 --> 03:37:52.120]  they have removed the language and and and debased it down to such a level that you can't even have
[03:37:52.120 --> 03:37:57.960]  a communication with the average person that's right but the problem i would go to first say
[03:37:57.960 --> 03:38:05.000]  in some important respects democracy exists least of all in america because what passes for
[03:38:05.000 --> 03:38:11.080]  democracy is simply for sale to the highest bidders it does include the zionist lobby in
[03:38:11.080 --> 03:38:16.520]  in association with the christian fundamentalist it does include the banks the drugs the military
[03:38:16.520 --> 03:38:22.520]  income uh industrial complex we we know them all i mean it seems to me that it really doesn't matter
[03:38:22.520 --> 03:38:27.480]  who the hell is in the white house who the hell is in number 10 downing street in london they are
[03:38:27.480 --> 03:38:33.560]  to a very large extent puppets of a very tiny minority of vested interests and that's why
[03:38:33.560 --> 03:38:39.320]  getting the truth out to mobilize citizens to make their democracy work is so important
[03:38:39.320 --> 03:38:43.480]  well you're right i mean there's really five big lobbies and they're all interconnected
[03:38:43.480 --> 03:38:48.440]  literally intermarried uh and they all want the same thing they want to keep the war on drugs
[03:38:48.440 --> 03:38:53.080]  going because they're shipping in the illegal drugs they want to push their deadly pharmaceuticals
[03:38:53.080 --> 03:38:59.000]  on us and have forced inoculations they want uh you know more tyranny uh the defense department
[03:38:59.000 --> 03:39:03.320]  the private contractors are now taking over the police departments the red light cameras
[03:39:03.320 --> 03:39:09.880]  the surveillance the iphone's the computers they are privatizing the police state and then
[03:39:09.880 --> 03:39:15.000]  literally absorbing the ones free society but i want to expand on things that you brought up here
[03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:19.560]  because i've studied 9 11 in depth i said they were going to attack the world trade centers
[03:39:19.560 --> 03:39:24.040]  two months before it happened i could see the preconditioning in the media that was taking place
[03:39:25.080 --> 03:39:30.200]  and your research in the middle east you know uh of how the massage and shin bed have infiltrated
[03:39:30.200 --> 03:39:35.640]  all these groups that's on record but it's more than that we know according to colonel butler
[03:39:35.640 --> 03:39:41.560]  the head of the defense language school and the ap and newsweek and other publications they hide
[03:39:41.560 --> 03:39:47.400]  discipline view that many of the hijackers were trained at us bases and we know they were taking
[03:39:47.400 --> 03:39:55.480]  part in drills infiltration drills and believe they were government agents uh so uh you know uh
[03:39:55.480 --> 03:40:00.360]  and we know israelis were paying for their houses uh were paying for their apartments were giving a
[03:40:00.360 --> 03:40:07.000]  money i mean this has come out even on fox news so but but that goes further uh
[03:40:08.360 --> 03:40:15.400]  than than than the israeli's just piggybacking on a muslim operation and and all i want is the truth
[03:40:15.400 --> 03:40:22.280]  how do you have these guys trained at us bases yeah but i think i mean one of the fascinating
[03:40:22.280 --> 03:40:28.680]  things about the whole unfolding drama is the film of what i call the five dancing israelis
[03:40:28.680 --> 03:40:34.200]  of course you're aware of that film yes i mean you pull out and you see one of the planes going
[03:40:34.200 --> 03:40:40.600]  into the building and you see these five guys virtually dancing all on mobile phones now you
[03:40:40.600 --> 03:40:46.040]  know and i'm sure most of your listeners know that they were originally reported as being just foreigners
[03:40:46.040 --> 03:40:52.840]  may be presumed muslims and the fbi gave chase didn't they and they tried to avoid arrest but
[03:40:52.840 --> 03:40:58.360]  they were eventually caught and surprise surprise they all turned out to be more sad agents now i
[03:40:58.360 --> 03:41:05.560]  think it's not unreasonable to speculate that on their telephones they may actually had been calling
[03:41:05.560 --> 03:41:13.000]  in the planes to the buildings yeah calling them in well if they were gps it would already be a
[03:41:13.000 --> 03:41:18.520]  pre-planned coordinate um well that could be but if they weren't they may have had some kind of
[03:41:18.520 --> 03:41:25.400]  transponder in which they were calling them into the target but i mean the point is the guys were
[03:41:25.400 --> 03:41:31.000]  there and they knew in a bump it was going to happen well i've talked to the sheriff uh because
[03:41:31.000 --> 03:41:34.680]  they ran a new jersey and i've talked to the sheriff on air who arrested him i mean it's not
[03:41:34.680 --> 03:41:41.640]  i mean that went on my only issue is look it's like a five-headed hydra and so i'm not saying
[03:41:41.640 --> 03:41:45.720]  one head of the hindra isn't guilty i'm just pointing out like you did with the us's liberty
[03:41:45.720 --> 03:41:51.960]  and i did that in one of my films terror storm because i interviewed the admirals who were involved
[03:41:51.960 --> 03:41:55.160]  and the judge advocate generals i mean i've interviewed them all most of them are dead now
[03:41:55.160 --> 03:42:01.720]  admiral moore you name it i've interviewed admiral geist and other admirals who were on the phone
[03:42:01.720 --> 03:42:06.600]  when mac namara said no the president says you can't defend the ship and then they say we don't care
[03:42:06.600 --> 03:42:10.680]  we're still going to defend the ship and then the president comes on and says i want that gd
[03:42:10.680 --> 03:42:15.160]  ship going to the bottom and he had taken control of the ship international security previously
[03:42:15.160 --> 03:42:21.960]  and parked it there so my only issue is israel was guilty of premeditatedly doing it 100 but
[03:42:21.960 --> 03:42:27.720]  this this program is so big the white house was coordinating the operation so i mean this this
[03:42:27.720 --> 03:42:34.520]  goes way back yeah i mean i've got a whole chapter in my latest three-volume book which is titled
[03:42:34.520 --> 03:42:40.680]  zanism the real enemy of the jews i i've got a separate chapter on the whole liberty affair
[03:42:41.240 --> 03:42:47.720]  and i bring it to an end by saying that what the liberty affair shows us is that there is nothing
[03:42:47.720 --> 03:42:55.560]  zanism won't do to its friends as well as its enemies to get its own way well i mean israel
[03:42:55.560 --> 03:43:02.200]  admits that they would they bombed jews out of iraq and out of spain yeah uh you know in the 40s
[03:43:02.200 --> 03:43:09.800]  and 50s to make him go to israel but but alex uh can i just say why i think we we both are passionate
[03:43:09.800 --> 03:43:17.240]  for the truth but can i just explain very shortly why the truth has to be handled with care because
[03:43:17.240 --> 03:43:27.080]  if it's not it could provoke anti-semitism now i i deal with this by saying there is one key to
[03:43:27.080 --> 03:43:33.800]  understanding and all of my jewish friends who are anti-zionists agree with me there is one key
[03:43:33.800 --> 03:43:42.040]  to understanding and it's the difference between judaism and zionism judaism is the religion of
[03:43:42.040 --> 03:43:47.960]  jews not the jews because not all jews are religious like islam like christianity it has
[03:43:47.960 --> 03:43:54.200]  a core instead of moral values and ethical principles zionism as jewish nationalism
[03:43:54.840 --> 03:44:01.240]  is a colonial enterprise which founded a state for some jews mainly by zionist terrorism and
[03:44:01.240 --> 03:44:08.760]  ethnic cleansing now the point is this that means that judaism and zionism actually are two opposites
[03:44:08.760 --> 03:44:14.680]  zionism conflates them so that it can accuse people like you and me who are critical of israel
[03:44:14.680 --> 03:44:20.520]  of being anti-semitic but i'm nearly finished on this explanation when you know the difference
[03:44:20.520 --> 03:44:27.240]  between judaism and zionism you can understand a why it is perfectly possible to be passionate
[03:44:27.240 --> 03:44:32.600]  the anti-zionists meaning anti the colonial enterprise without being in any way shape or form
[03:44:32.600 --> 03:44:38.600]  anti-semitic anti-two more importantly you can understand why it's wrong to blame all jews
[03:44:38.600 --> 03:44:44.280]  everywhere for the crimes of the few in israel sure but i just want to be specific on this whole
[03:44:44.280 --> 03:44:52.520]  subject to me uh i don't even approach it from psychologically from an issue of of jews or
[03:44:52.520 --> 03:44:58.280]  germans or chinese the chinese government does horrible atrocities and takes political
[03:44:58.280 --> 03:45:03.880]  dissidents organs what does that have to do with chinese people or there's an italian mafia
[03:45:03.880 --> 03:45:08.760]  what does that have to do with it with with italians or john wane gasey the serial killer
[03:45:08.760 --> 03:45:13.880]  was a was a was a was a wasp or a white guy i mean that was to do with white people i mean
[03:45:13.880 --> 03:45:19.560]  every major government i've studied the russians have been caught countless times staging terror
[03:45:19.560 --> 03:45:25.160]  attacks the zars did it the communists did it i mean this is just i believe what the founding
[03:45:25.160 --> 03:45:30.520]  fathers did any big government tends towards corruption like you said about the arab states
[03:45:30.520 --> 03:45:35.720]  highly corrupt uh you know the saudi arabians are constantly doing just unspeakably bad things
[03:45:35.720 --> 03:45:42.280]  and so you know to me the media like you said wants to make it about anti-semitism and we've
[03:45:42.280 --> 03:45:47.320]  caught the feds running all these white supremacist groups to go out and be inherently anti-semitic
[03:45:47.320 --> 03:45:55.000]  to then poison the water from a real debate let me put it this way i think the real division
[03:45:55.000 --> 03:46:02.280]  on earth the real division is not actually between rich and poor i think the real division
[03:46:02.280 --> 03:46:10.120]  is between governments and the vested interests which sort of run them and the citizens of nations
[03:46:10.120 --> 03:46:18.040]  yes absolutely that to me is the real division and that's where the real struggle is and the
[03:46:18.040 --> 03:46:26.360]  reason why truth is so important is because it's only by truth that the citizens of nations can
[03:46:26.360 --> 03:46:32.520]  be empowered to make their democracy work by calling their representatives and even their
[03:46:32.520 --> 03:46:37.160]  presidents and prime ministers to account right yes or alan heart in the time we've got with you
[03:46:37.160 --> 03:46:41.880]  don't have you back up soon without your amazing research all the incredibly famous people you've
[03:46:41.880 --> 03:46:47.000]  interviewed uh because uh i mean i love history and i want to get it from your perspective and
[03:46:47.000 --> 03:46:51.560]  also talk more about your three-volume uh book that's out the third volume coming out soon uh
[03:46:51.560 --> 03:46:56.040]  alan heart dot net is that the best website to give out um yeah but there's also my american
[03:46:56.040 --> 03:47:03.320]  publisher um w w w clarity press dot com clarity press dot com and we'll talk about the title of
[03:47:03.320 --> 03:47:06.920]  the book and more before you leave us and i'm going to keep you a little bit in the next hour
[03:47:06.920 --> 03:47:12.120]  with bob shatman because uh this time is just exploding past us but i want to digress now
[03:47:12.120 --> 03:47:18.920]  now regardless of the players involved in 9 11 and then we know u.s british and israeli
[03:47:18.920 --> 03:47:24.200]  it intelligence are all merged at the app so all three groups know what really happened
[03:47:24.200 --> 03:47:29.560]  and there was a standout of our air defense cheney was in control of it there were israeli spies
[03:47:29.560 --> 03:47:35.000]  all over the place that's admitted uh this takes to high heaven we we know they blew the towers up
[03:47:35.000 --> 03:47:40.280]  so let's go back to that because i just want to have the national debate about you know what is
[03:47:40.280 --> 03:47:46.360]  the true story of 9 11 uh because none of us are safe if that doesn't come out now uh and we know
[03:47:46.360 --> 03:47:50.360]  governments have been cost-staging events in the past to get us into war so so and we know about
[03:47:50.360 --> 03:47:55.880]  operation northwood so let's go back to the thought processes you know you're a big independent
[03:47:55.880 --> 03:48:02.200]  journalist author top bbc you know in the previously 9 11 happens what spurred you to talk
[03:48:03.240 --> 03:48:08.600]  to these colleagues these top engineers what was the process what were the discussions like
[03:48:08.600 --> 03:48:17.480]  when they came to you more details of uh you know this info and then you're self-censoring
[03:48:17.480 --> 03:48:22.280]  because we know a lot of other people did that go ahead well i may tell you when i first took the
[03:48:22.280 --> 03:48:28.760]  matter up with the uh my world-leading uh technical consultant i must tell you that their very first
[03:48:28.760 --> 03:48:36.760]  response was to tell me allen it's possible that the planes did bring down the building because
[03:48:36.760 --> 03:48:44.040]  although the the burning fuel was not enough of itself to create the heat to melt the steel
[03:48:44.760 --> 03:48:52.120]  as the fire ravaged down and down and down through the buildings consuming everything else it may
[03:48:52.120 --> 03:48:58.680]  possibly have generated enough heat so that was their starting position alex but then when they
[03:48:58.680 --> 03:49:06.360]  got themselves and i gave them all the film and other visual evidence of what had happened
[03:49:06.360 --> 03:49:13.400]  it was after their full studying of that that these world-leading experts who i know and i trust
[03:49:13.400 --> 03:49:20.760]  said allen know our first thought was wrong there is absolutely no question it was brought
[03:49:20.760 --> 03:49:29.720]  the towers are brought down by controlled explosions from within so um once that's
[03:49:29.720 --> 03:49:35.240]  established and many of your own american experts have established that there was just no getting
[03:49:35.240 --> 03:49:42.840]  away from it alec it is a conspiracy well the bigger issue here is all these other engineers
[03:49:42.840 --> 03:49:50.200]  you know so so so you're there talking to them you can see them being you know blown up uh the
[03:49:51.080 --> 03:49:56.520]  the concrete being turned to dust the beams being ejected 600 feet you know it's clearly
[03:49:56.520 --> 03:50:02.840]  happening building seven not hit by a plane a classical control demolition why are these
[03:50:02.840 --> 03:50:08.680]  engineers and i guess thousands have gone public now and architects and physicists but why aren't
[03:50:08.680 --> 03:50:14.440]  more of them you know any engineer who really looks at this knows the truth nist has backed out of
[03:50:14.440 --> 03:50:22.280]  their last six reasons that building seven fell on the towers fell they lied into the building
[03:50:22.280 --> 03:50:29.720]  was hollow and all these other things so you know why do people then just cowardly not come out and
[03:50:29.720 --> 03:50:36.520]  tell the truth alex it's very simple why if you look at the mainstream media and you and i think
[03:50:36.520 --> 03:50:42.920]  would agree that it totally suppresses the truth not only about 911 not only about many things it
[03:50:42.920 --> 03:50:47.880]  totally suppresses the truth about the making and sustaining of conflicts in the middle east and
[03:50:47.880 --> 03:50:51.480]  why does it do this all right stay there we're going to come back and talk about that with our

[03:54:05.960 --> 03:54:09.960]  well we know that 9-11's an inside job and they blew those buildings sky-high
[03:54:11.080 --> 03:54:16.920]  and all the major western governments up to their eyeballs in knowledge of it
[03:54:16.920 --> 03:54:22.360]  and people inside government yet it has the dual effect where people that are in the know
[03:54:22.360 --> 03:54:26.680]  get even more scared in self-censor and the general public buys into the lie and then
[03:54:26.680 --> 03:54:31.000]  they're ready to believe the next lie about wmd's or whatever's going on but when you have
[03:54:31.560 --> 03:54:37.480]  all of these you know these four or five big lobbies when they line up on an issue and when
[03:54:37.480 --> 03:54:45.160]  it helps all of them you better believe you're going to see a movement and uh it's just horrible
[03:54:45.160 --> 03:54:50.840]  but but alan heart uh you know two points going back to these top engineers you're talking to
[03:54:50.840 --> 03:54:57.880]  were they horrified after they saw the information a and then b are you not seeing the massive
[03:54:57.880 --> 03:55:02.040]  awakening where people are just sick of self-censoring and we are seeing everybody come out of the
[03:55:02.040 --> 03:55:07.080]  woodwork just just just telling the truth now and i think this the system is very afraid well
[03:55:07.080 --> 03:55:12.440]  i think i i think something very important is happening i mean what i'm i'm learning on this
[03:55:12.440 --> 03:55:19.320]  uh first of all i hope will be several trips to america is that most americans most english people
[03:55:19.320 --> 03:55:28.120]  most europeans as citizens and voters we have one thing in common we now loathe all of our
[03:55:28.120 --> 03:55:33.640]  politicians isn't that what we have in common all the polls show it for the first time in history
[03:55:33.640 --> 03:55:39.160]  both parties are are universally hated well i the last time i saw a poll i think congress's
[03:55:39.160 --> 03:55:46.760]  rating was down to 21 percent and falling to 20 now that is very serious so maybe what we are
[03:55:46.760 --> 03:55:54.360]  witnessing is the beginning of a process in which people are beginning to wake up but what they
[03:55:54.360 --> 03:56:00.840]  got to do ray is to make their feelings known and say up with this we are not putting but let me
[03:56:00.840 --> 03:56:07.400]  speculate to a nightmare scenario in britain we're heading for three million unemployed now it's
[03:56:07.400 --> 03:56:14.040]  calculated but if we pass that and we will they'll be rioting on the streets look at america if the
[03:56:14.040 --> 03:56:20.600]  economy continues to go bad and in my view it will your your economic situation is going to go worse
[03:56:20.600 --> 03:56:26.440]  go into next year the economic situation gets worse you have a long hot summer i believe you too will
[03:56:26.440 --> 03:56:33.400]  have rioting on the streets the problem is the system wants that that gives the system the opportunity
[03:56:33.400 --> 03:56:38.360]  to bring in martial law and by by what passes for democracy that's my fear well alan and and we
[03:56:38.360 --> 03:56:43.960]  have the imf world bank documents that were leaked when sicklets uh the Nobel prize winner left
[03:56:43.960 --> 03:56:49.960]  in 2002 the imf calls it the imf riot you're absolutely right and they're admittedly gearing
[03:56:49.960 --> 03:56:55.800]  up for it all over europe england and the u.s this has been a planned implosion just like the
[03:56:55.800 --> 03:57:01.960]  goldman sacks document show yeah i mean i think the truth is that almost all of our politicians
[03:57:01.960 --> 03:57:08.040]  loathe democracy or what part of the democracy is something like the shawty done well we've seen
[03:57:08.040 --> 03:57:15.000]  obama's people bush uh they're constantly saying what we saw uh the famous director
[03:57:16.040 --> 03:57:21.160]  came out woody alan just last week and said it'd be great if obama was a dictator we should just
[03:57:21.160 --> 03:57:26.840]  lock up all the people that disagree with him and they're serious but the name of the game i think
[03:57:26.840 --> 03:57:33.080]  we're not disagreeing alex the name of the game is informing people to give them the possibility
[03:57:33.720 --> 03:57:39.080]  empowering them to make their democracy work before he's taken away from us and i agree but we've
[03:57:39.080 --> 03:57:44.920]  but but to make it work we've got to be hardcore like you are and just tell it like it is you know
[03:57:44.920 --> 03:57:49.800]  you go in and you got brain cancer and it's operable you don't tell them they got a sprained ankle
[03:57:49.800 --> 03:57:57.480]  right right it comes down uh ready to um what one feels about the potential of americans and
[03:57:57.480 --> 03:58:03.320]  let me tell you this i've said it publicly before i have a love hate relationship with america on
[03:58:03.320 --> 03:58:10.120]  one level i think most americans generally speaking are the most misinformed under informed
[03:58:10.120 --> 03:58:16.360]  colorable people on earth that's a bad news the good news is that deep down i think they are the
[03:58:16.360 --> 03:58:22.920]  most idealistic and if they were properly informed and well led i think they could not only turn
[03:58:22.920 --> 03:58:28.440]  their own country around i think they could give the world the needed needs am i being naive for
[03:58:28.440 --> 03:58:33.640]  thinking no you are spot on that's why we're brainwashed that's why we're dumb down is because
[03:58:33.640 --> 03:58:38.520]  they understand we've had the greatest liberty in history here and it's a contagion to the elite
