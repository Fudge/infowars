[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:21.000]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.000 --> 00:37.000]  I'm going to be honest with you. My head is spinning right now. I am having a lot of trouble
[00:37.000 --> 00:49.000]  processing and dealing with the off-the-chart magnitude of craziness going on in this world
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.000]  and reading the news day in, day out, in the morning, noon, and night, being aware of what's
[00:54.000 --> 01:04.000]  going on and then not even being able to process it all at once is truly, truly mind-boggling
[01:04.000 --> 01:14.000]  on so many fronts. But I read a bill this morning, and Melissa Melton's doing an article
[01:14.000 --> 01:25.000]  about this. SB 63, here in Texas, and this is being passed all over the country, California
[01:25.000 --> 01:33.000]  was the first last year, to where the government can come and get your 10-year-old to consent
[01:33.000 --> 01:40.000]  to a vaccine, even if you say no, saying the child, and this is a UN revolution, where
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  they say children can give consent to sex, they can give consent to drugs, they can give
[01:45.000 --> 01:48.000]  consent to vaccines, they can give consent to abortions.
[01:48.000 --> 01:57.000]  Now, you have statutory rape. You have contributing to the delinquency of a minor. You have all
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.000]  of this historically, and it's on the books, it's in common law, it's in the state laws,
[02:01.000 --> 02:08.000]  and you read this. This is just one of the outrageous here in front of me, the government
[02:08.000 --> 02:16.000]  releasing 10,000 violent illegal aliens, the warrantless wiretapping, the draconian gun
[02:16.000 --> 02:23.000]  grabbing laws, the 85 billion to foreign megabanks of our taxpayer money every month, the designed
[02:23.000 --> 02:24.000]  tyranny being brought in.
[02:24.000 --> 02:31.000]  You read this, and it says the child may consent to the child's own immunization, and then
[02:31.000 --> 02:39.000]  it goes on to just say the child can do whatever they want. And it also pushes giving pregnant
[02:39.000 --> 02:45.000]  women tetanus shots, which they've always known causes miscarriages. And they also,
[02:45.000 --> 02:52.000]  in the legislation, say that all childcare workers or anyone around children, football
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.000]  coaches, YMCA workers, if you work around children, they're already doing this now,
[02:57.000 --> 03:01.000]  the hospitals are making anybody that works there take shots outside of law.
[03:01.000 --> 03:06.000]  Some states have passed laws, the first ones making you take shots, now it's anybody involved
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  in childcare. They're going to make the government and the globalist on record with all their
[03:11.000 --> 03:17.000]  secret experiments against us. They're trying to set the precedent where you will put in
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  your body what they say. I mean, it is incredible, it is so off the charts.
[03:22.000 --> 03:28.000]  So I'm gonna be covering this in the shower. I'm gonna get into all the other big news
[03:28.000 --> 03:35.000]  first, and then we've got Ted Nugent. He called in Sunday, but he's on with us today. Ted
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  Nugent, one of the most prominent leaders of the Second Amendment movement, you can
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  disagree with some of his politics, but not on the Second Amendment.
[03:42.000 --> 03:51.000]  And he is definitely a target of the system in many, many, many different ways. And the
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.000]  establishment is coming after Ted Nugent. And so we've got to hang together, hang separate,
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.000]  he's gonna be joining us in the second hour. And then talk about a power pack show, Gerald
[04:01.000 --> 04:07.000]  Salente joining us live from Kingston, New York in the third hour.
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.000]  It's a taped interview I did with Nugent because he can only do it in the afternoon after the
[04:12.000 --> 04:18.000]  show, or he can do it live Friday. And I'm gonna be working tomorrow part of the day,
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.000]  but Mike Adams is sitting in and do a great job sitting in here. The Health Rangers got
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  a big show lined up for you.
[04:26.000 --> 04:38.000]  And so that is basically coming up today. Gerald Salente and Ted Nugent here on the
[04:38.000 --> 04:46.000]  broadcast today. We are live. It is Thursday, the last day of February 2013. We're already
[04:46.000 --> 04:55.000]  about to be in the third month of 2013, the Ides of March. Beware them. All right, get

[07:59.000 --> 08:20.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[08:20.000 --> 08:29.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. Central Standard Time, we are here live,
[08:29.000 --> 08:33.000]  ladies and gentlemen. Again, thank you so much for joining us today.
[08:33.000 --> 08:40.000]  All right, where to start? Wow, we've got Gerald Cilente joining us live in the third
[08:40.000 --> 08:47.000]  hour today. We have Ted Nugent coming back on the broadcast after he called in, listening
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.000]  to the Sunday show. I guess he was listening on 590 a.m. here locally. He lives north of
[08:52.000 --> 08:59.000]  Austin, Texas, lived in Texas now for 10 years. This is a taped interview because he couldn't
[08:59.000 --> 09:07.000]  do it when I was live yesterday. So he did it taped. It's very, very powerful and it
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.000]  will premiere in the next hour.
[09:09.000 --> 09:15.000]  Paul Watson is going to be popping in about this report that's up at Infowars.com right
[09:15.000 --> 09:22.000]  now that has gotten almost no attention. Tech guru warns of Internet disaster. Scientist
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.000]  Danny Hillis calls for Internet Plan B in times of emergency. And then Paul Watson links
[09:28.000 --> 09:35.000]  to articles that I and he wrote more than six, seven years ago with the Internet2MIT
[09:35.000 --> 09:41.000]  DARPA Consortium publicly meeting at conferences with the minutes of the meetings saying there
[09:41.000 --> 09:48.000]  would be staged attacks on the Web and a pretext to build a new government global Homeland
[09:48.000 --> 09:54.000]  Security system that government is on and select corporations Internet2 that they will
[09:54.000 --> 10:00.000]  then shut down the old Web, forcing everyone on to the new Web with the new systems where
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  you have no basic liberties.
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  So it's like either taking an existing road over and making it a toll road or building
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.000]  some other lanes next to a road and then not repairing the other road and then finally
[10:14.000 --> 10:20.000]  shutting the old road down. Instead of letting the old road build, they bring in cybersecurity
[10:20.000 --> 10:28.000]  to choke the old road, to shut it down, to pot market, to put surveillance grids in it.
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.000]  And they cite Stuxnet is why they have to take the Web over when the Pentagon with Israel
[10:32.000 --> 10:39.000]  launched Stuxnet a year and a half ago. So there is all of that news as well that we
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.000]  are going to be breaking down here today.
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  And I'm going to get Paul Watson to pop in. And Paul Watson is such a prolific writer
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  and researcher of the incredible crew I've got. He is the best. And I just want to recognize
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.000]  him as our most valuable player in the fight for liberty. But still, he tends to underplay
[10:58.000 --> 11:05.000]  things. And I'm like, look, reality is sensational. Go with what it is, because we're not tabloid.
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  In fact, nine times out of ten, we underestimate. I mean, look at this headline. Tech guru warns
[11:10.000 --> 11:17.000]  of Internet disaster. Scientist Annie Hill calls for Internet Plan B in times of emergency.
[11:17.000 --> 11:22.000]  The headline should be Infowars.com prediction comes true. Globalists plan to kill the old
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  Web to force you on the new Web. And then we give all their quotes and all their background
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  on this. I mean, they've been talking about this. I learned about Internet to take over
[11:31.000 --> 11:37.000]  the first time they met in 2000. Then a few years later, they met in Austin and I actually
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  went to the conference.
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  OK, and I mean, off record, they're like, of course, we're going to shut down the old
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.000]  Web and bring in a corporate one. It's going to be like a glorified cable box where you're
[11:48.000 --> 11:55.000]  only going to have big platforms like Yahoo, like Google. And then you'll have a sub domain
[11:55.000 --> 12:00.000]  on it, but you'll have no rights and everything surveilled on it. Again, people keep asking,
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  Alex, how do you keep knowing what's going to happen? How how do you keep predicting
[12:04.000 --> 12:11.000]  all this? Are are you CIA? Are you are how do you know?
[12:11.000 --> 12:19.000]  Ladies and gentlemen. I read their white papers and their own publications, the globalist
[12:19.000 --> 12:27.000]  operate like you don't exist and like you're a dumb animal. They operate like you were
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  the stupidest person on the planet. And listen, I'm frustrated because I've been around people
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  in business that don't know about politics or geopolitical systems or history of the
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.000]  world who do know about everything else and who are really smart.
[12:41.000 --> 12:48.000]  OK. I'm always amazed at how smart people are about general things, but then there's
[12:48.000 --> 12:54.000]  there's like a blank spot when it comes to larger systems in history. And it's because
[12:54.000 --> 13:01.000]  they are nice people. They cannot imagine that that things are actually this horrible.
[13:01.000 --> 13:07.000]  And if you study criminology, that's why women get in the car. With the serial killer, because
[13:07.000 --> 13:12.000]  he's wearing a suit, serial killers know to go out and wear a suit, have clean cut hair,
[13:12.000 --> 13:13.000]  drive a nice car.
[13:13.000 --> 13:17.000]  Women will get in the car with you. In fact, the more evil you are, the quicker they'll
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.000]  get in the car because they misjudge the confidence in their biology. Women at a subconscious
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  level and a genetic level are looking for aggressive, powerful killers. But but but
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  not of women. They're looking for predators that will protect them and be a powerful warrior.
[13:32.000 --> 13:39.000]  The problem is a psychopath is a is a genetic anomaly that has a warrior type battle system
[13:39.000 --> 13:46.000]  and high IQ and silver tongue, but is a predator that just wants to feed on the innocent. Not
[13:46.000 --> 13:53.000]  a predator that wants to defend their own family and be a predator against tyrants.
[13:53.000 --> 13:59.000]  They are a twisted warrior. But I'm now digressing. Ladies and gentlemen, Ted Nugent coming up,
[13:59.000 --> 14:04.000]  Gerald Cilente as well. Now let's stop right there. No, it's not the Ted Nugent when he
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  called in Sunday. It's a new Ted Nugent. Ted Nugent's coming back on. Big interview. Why
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  do I know? I taped it.
[14:11.000 --> 14:16.000]  He couldn't come on during a live show. Again, it's a tape show. Great job the crew did.
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.000]  And that is coming up. But then I'm live with Gerald Cilente after that. I'll actually have
[14:21.000 --> 14:24.000]  a lunch hour, but I'm not really gonna have a lunch hour. I'm gonna be running around
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  doing 15 different things during an hour. I'm having meetings and recording some key
[14:28.000 --> 14:35.000]  reports now. Because reality rests for no man or woman. Now, speaking of thinking you're
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.000]  stupid, speaking of building this technocracy, admitting it's a technocracy, admitting that
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  it's anti-human, admitting that it's nightmarish.
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.000]  They then separately sit there on the news and all the magazines going, none of it exists,
[14:50.000 --> 14:57.000]  none of it's happening. I mean, years after the illegal unconstitutional Geneva Convention
[14:57.000 --> 15:03.000]  violating, international law violating, drones killing innocent people, collateral damage,
[15:03.000 --> 15:08.000]  all of it, Skynet being developed and tested.
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]  Gibbs, I played the clip a few days ago. Can you guys cue that back up? Thank you. It's
[15:12.000 --> 15:18.000]  only like 35 seconds long. Gibbs goes on MSNBC and says, which is basically White House run
[15:18.000 --> 15:24.000]  and says, hey, I was told to say this didn't exist, which was ridiculous cuz publicly it
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  existed for years.
[15:26.000 --> 15:32.000]  It's like saying Grand Central Station doesn't exist in New York. It's like saying it's a
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.000]  conspiracy theory that the Dallas Cowboys had Tom Landry as their coach. Anybody knows
[15:37.000 --> 15:42.000]  that's not true. So the question is, why do they do that? To just get you used to being
[15:42.000 --> 15:49.000]  lied to, learned helplessness, mass Stockholm syndrome, normalcy bias.
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  They're trying to get you used to troops on the streets, checkpoints, craziness, huge
[15:53.000 --> 15:59.000]  cancer rate increases, forcibly giving your kids shots in public schools. That's now about
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.000]  to happen in Texas. This is incredible, and around the rest of the country. And giving
[16:04.000 --> 16:09.000]  women shots that they know for 50 years give you miscarriage is a very high percentage
[16:09.000 --> 16:10.000]  of the time.
[16:10.000 --> 16:16.000]  They're talking about making it the law to give pregnant women tetanus shots when it's
[16:16.000 --> 16:22.000]  a death sentence for that baby. And everybody's like, yeah, okay, so 20% of women that take
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.000]  it, 25% or so, have a miscarriage. And they're just gonna normalize, maybe even arresting
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.000]  the woman. Now when they give baby shots for 30 something years, and they have a convulsion
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.000]  and die in the hospital, they just cover it up and say they don't know what it is.
[16:34.000 --> 16:39.000]  Or if it happens in the car, they arrest you. And even the cops now know, would you just
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.000]  come from the hospital getting shots? I'm still gonna arrest you. It's all like a big
[16:43.000 --> 16:49.000]  joke. We didn't just kill your kid with sudden infant death syndrome. We're gonna charge
[16:49.000 --> 16:55.000]  you with a felony when we just murdered your kid.
[16:55.000 --> 17:02.000]  I mean, SIDS didn't exist till they went up to over 20 shots. You say, listen, they don't
[17:02.000 --> 17:06.000]  give me 20, they give more like nine or ten. Well, a lot of them are triple shots. But
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.000]  they're putting up to 20 different things in your baby. And notice, a lot of kids can
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  fight it off when they're first born.
[17:11.000 --> 17:16.000]  They've got all mama's hormones in them, they're tough, everything. They've been feeding off
[17:16.000 --> 17:21.000]  mama's placenta. But man, they come in six months later, boy, they get that shot, baby's
[17:21.000 --> 17:26.000]  dead. Baby goes home, blood on the brain. They do an autopsy, there's blood all in the
[17:26.000 --> 17:27.000]  brain.
[17:27.000 --> 17:30.000]  Well, we know in the inserts, this doesn't matter. Let's put some handcuffs on you right
[17:30.000 --> 17:35.000]  now. We're gonna make you do hard time. And that judge knows full well, okay, another
[17:35.000 --> 17:40.000]  mother, we killed their kids, we killed their daughter or son. Line them up, get ready for
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  prison, 20 years in prison.
[17:42.000 --> 17:52.000]  And the jury, conviction, you're gone, doing hard time. Yeah, and now we're gonna give
[17:52.000 --> 17:57.000]  you tetanus shots, got the bills right here. Texas, other states, they're already passing
[17:57.000 --> 18:00.000]  these in some states. They're gonna give your kids shots without consent. I'm gonna be covering
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  this at the bottom of the hour.
[18:02.000 --> 18:07.000]  They're gonna be doing it all. And they're gonna make anybody who's in childcare from
[18:07.000 --> 18:12.000]  little league coaches to people that work at the YMCA, everybody, you're gonna take
[18:12.000 --> 18:17.000]  whatever list of shots they say. It's over 56 of them right now. And you're gonna get
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  cancer and you're gonna die.
[18:19.000 --> 18:23.000]  And you're gonna thank the government. And you're gonna cower when the police in black
[18:23.000 --> 18:28.000]  uniforms come and give you the shots forcibly. Yes, you're gonna love it. The cops are gonna
[18:28.000 --> 18:34.000]  take all the shots and die too. And they're gonna watch babies die and love it cuz they're
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  good guys. The government's good.
[18:37.000 --> 18:42.000]  And I'm wrong to not think they're good. Let's play Gibbs. Here's Gibbs laughing about Wizard
[18:42.000 --> 18:45.000]  of Oz. I'm lying to you. Here it is.
[18:45.000 --> 18:50.000]  When I went through the process of becoming press secretary, one of the first things they
[18:50.000 --> 18:55.000]  told me was, you're not even to acknowledge the drone program. You're not even to discuss
[18:55.000 --> 19:01.000]  that it exists. And so I would get a question like that and literally I couldn't tell you
[19:01.000 --> 19:05.000]  what major asked because once I figured out it was about the drone program, I realized
[19:05.000 --> 19:11.000]  I'm not supposed to talk about it. But here's what's inherently crazy about that proposition.
[19:11.000 --> 19:18.000]  You're being asked a question based on reporting of a program that exists, right? So you're
[19:18.000 --> 19:23.000]  the official government spokesperson acting as if the entire program, pay no attention
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  to the man behind the curtain.
[19:25.000 --> 19:30.000]  And there is a public program in every government in eco science. I just gave you sources where
[19:30.000 --> 19:35.000]  they weaponize vaccines to soft kill you, where it kills you six months, two years down
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.000]  the road, or gives you degenerative disorders. I mean, they're all off the charts. They're
[19:39.000 --> 19:44.000]  killing us. It's a fact. And now they're gonna up the ante and kill us even faster. We're
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  all being bug poisoned right now.
[19:46.000 --> 19:51.000]  And when we come back, they're now saying Sarah Palin's crazy. There's no 2 billion
[19:51.000 --> 19:55.000]  bullets. They say, yeah, there are bullets, but it discredits you that you're right. They
[19:55.000 --> 19:59.000]  say, Jones is discredited, but there are the bullets. And you're like, where's your proof?
[19:59.000 --> 20:03.000]  Well, you're right. That's what makes you wrong. Introducing pro wine, all of your filtration

[21:09.000 --> 21:14.000]  Then I learned about RNA drops. I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called
[21:14.000 --> 21:19.000]  junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling
[21:19.000 --> 21:24.000]  how my cells, organs and other tissues behave. I learned I don't have to put up with disease
[21:24.000 --> 21:30.000]  decay or decline like I'd been conditioned to believe. I began taking RNA drops a 100%
[21:30.000 --> 21:34.000]  natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide me with amazing health

[22:33.000 --> 22:38.000]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry

[24:09.000 --> 24:13.000]  Alex Jones here back live. The websites are info awards dot com, prison planet dot com
[24:13.000 --> 24:19.000]  and streaming video at prison planet dot TV. We are the tip of the spear against the eugenics,
[24:19.000 --> 24:25.000]  soft killed, ambient murder operation going on. And you can just type in government programs,
[24:25.000 --> 24:31.000]  UN caught adding sterilants, UN caught adding viruses, UN caught adding live polio. And
[24:31.000 --> 24:35.000]  it's all mainstream news over the last 50 years, just exterminating people everywhere.
[24:35.000 --> 24:39.000]  And now they're doing it to us here. Think about it. It's not enough to kill people's
[24:39.000 --> 24:46.000]  kids with your shots that their own studies and inserts say it does. You got to take the
[24:46.000 --> 24:52.000]  parents to jail after you murder their kid or brain damage them. Good job. I salute you
[24:52.000 --> 24:59.000]  New World Order. Yeah. But hey, you know, you can argue the parents deserve it. This
[24:59.000 --> 25:04.000]  government's on record testing Kim bios on third world countries, black people, whites,
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  Hispanics, doesn't matter.
[25:06.000 --> 25:12.000]  Live syphilis injecting people radiating little children in the 50s, 60s and 70s. They haven't
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.000]  declassified anything since then. It's much worse now. It's like a government that's been
[25:17.000 --> 25:22.000]  taught, you know, 4300 plus foster kids, the Department of Energy from the 40s through
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  the 70s, taken foster kids and frying them.
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  Some of the radiation tests, they did them from a little bit to a lot, would kill the
[25:30.000 --> 25:36.000]  kid dying screaming in a matter of minutes. I mean, putting them in a radiation chamber,
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.000]  frying little kids clawing at the walls as you fry and murder a child. As they cook like
[25:41.000 --> 25:47.000]  a microwave and they get a white film on their eyes. But everything's OK. The government's
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.000]  nice. They're going to take care of me. Drink my fluoride water. Eat my aspartame that on
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  records causing type 2 diabetes to explode.
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  It's fun when your wife gets cancer. It's fun when your kids get cancer. It's fun when
[26:00.000 --> 26:06.000]  your neighbors get it. It's a fun thing. Let's just take it lying down. Let's not get upset.
[26:06.000 --> 26:12.000]  Let's not get angry. That's extreme. Murdering little kids isn't extreme. Me getting upset.
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  It's extreme. Me getting freaked out by the legislation that Melissa Melton brought me
[26:16.000 --> 26:17.000]  this morning.
[26:17.000 --> 26:22.000]  And I went and looked it up. It's introduced in Texas for forced inoculations. Every child
[26:22.000 --> 26:27.000]  care worker. If you work at a Mr. Gaddy's and kids are around, you got to take shots.
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.000]  If you work at the YMCA, you got to take shots. I mean, just the end of everything. Total
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  tyranny. The cops are in the uniforms. They're ready. They're coming. They love it. Child
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.000]  sized targets to shoot. Old women targets. Checkpoints. They're tough. They're ready.
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.000]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They win. They win every time. America's theirs.
[26:47.000 --> 26:51.000]  And they run Al-Qaeda publicly. That's all over the news. But I'm on talk shows. How
[26:51.000 --> 26:56.000]  dare you say 9-11's an inside job and our government did it. Our government doesn't
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.000]  exist. It's run by a bunch of psycho New World Order people. Of course they run Al-Qaeda.
[27:01.000 --> 27:07.000]  And now it's all over the news. It was the U.S. security force over Benghazi that went
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  and killed the stupid.
[27:09.000 --> 27:15.000]  I mean, I say stupid. The ambassador is there giving weapons to Al-Qaeda. That was his job.
[27:15.000 --> 27:21.000]  And so they wanted him dead. That was a hit. That was a White House murder. It's the only
[27:21.000 --> 27:27.000]  way to look at it. You look at the evidence. That's what it is. That's what's going on.
[27:27.000 --> 27:32.000]  Of course, they didn't get more security. It was the Benghazi security funded by the
[27:32.000 --> 27:38.000]  State Department and the CIA that came over there and killed the ambassador. They got
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.000]  rid of the bag man that gave him over 10,000 heat seeking missiles.
[27:43.000 --> 27:48.000]  They murdered him and they happened to fight back for eight hours and it got embarrassing
[27:48.000 --> 27:53.000]  as CENTCOM sat there watching their own troops and people get killed. And we're saying, why
[27:53.000 --> 27:57.000]  don't we give them aid? And the White House said, stand down, just like the USS Liberty
[27:57.000 --> 28:04.000]  in 1967. And then it's all, they said they didn't know, but they did. And they ordered
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.000]  to stand down for eight hours. Of course they did. Their people went to kill everybody in
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  the compound.
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.000]  But you don't think they won't kill an ambassador to cover something up when they put cancer
[28:16.000 --> 28:22.000]  viruses in your vaccines? And when your kid has a autoimmune response and blood on the
[28:22.000 --> 28:26.000]  brain, we've had brain surgeons on about this like Blalock. The insert says it, does it,
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.000]  and your child has a convulsion. They even take people's kids. There are other kids that
[28:30.000 --> 28:37.000]  live. When the kid has a convulsion in the clinic, they'll call the police and go, did
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  you just beat your child outside of here?
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  Give them a shot. You're waiting while the other kids get shot. Junior falls down, starts
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  flopping around, or the toddler falls down, you're going to jail. You're like, hey, did
[28:47.000 --> 28:52.000]  that shot do it? Shut up, handcuffs are on you right now. I'm such a good officer. The
[28:52.000 --> 28:57.000]  government's so good. Yeah, they're so good. Thank you, government, you're so loving. I
[28:57.000 --> 29:01.000]  love you so much. It's a sick freak world, man.
[29:01.000 --> 29:07.000]  And then there's AP, there's Washington Post. There's all of them going, Alex Jones is discredited.
[29:07.000 --> 29:14.000]  Sarah Palin is discredited. These people are cooks. They are caught lying about 2 billion
[29:14.000 --> 29:15.000]  bullets.
[29:15.000 --> 29:21.000]  Then you read the article, got a new one, Politico. Fed's media rebuts Sarah Palin's
[29:21.000 --> 29:26.000]  stockpiling bullets claim. And then it goes on to say, well, they are buying the bullets,
[29:26.000 --> 29:33.000]  but it's no big deal. And then never say the amount's 2 billion and only talk about a few
[29:33.000 --> 29:37.000]  thousand by one agency and say that's no big deal. I mean, this is written just like the
[29:37.000 --> 29:43.000]  Washington Post one and the AP one with total deception. Total deception to their readers
[29:43.000 --> 29:47.000]  just abusing them. We bought a couple hundred thousand bullets. Sarah Palin is a coop. We
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  always buy that. You bought 2 billion.
[29:49.000 --> 29:56.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:56.000 --> 30:02.000]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights
[30:02.000 --> 30:07.000]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[30:07.000 --> 30:12.000]  elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half
[30:12.000 --> 30:17.000]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now, there are hundreds of great products
[30:17.000 --> 30:22.000]  at info worst team dot com. But I want to point out the three that have helped me lose
[30:22.000 --> 30:30.000]  thirty seven pounds in just two months. Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst
[30:30.000 --> 30:34.000]  and Rebound. When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I
[30:34.000 --> 30:39.000]  lost more than thirty seven pounds in just two months. Now that's results. I want to
[30:39.000 --> 30:45.000]  challenge my listeners to go to info wars team dot com and to order just three of their
[30:45.000 --> 30:50.000]  products. And you will see the changes in the way you look, the way you look, the way

[33:19.000 --> 33:22.000]  of the spear. Thank you for spreading the word about it out there during the three minute
[33:22.000 --> 33:30.000]  break. This is what I was doing. I walked back to Melissa Melton's desk who is working
[33:30.000 --> 33:35.000]  on this next report from full wars dot com. And, you know, we don't just see a report
[33:35.000 --> 33:39.000]  about, hey, they're going to make pregnant women take tetanus shots. We know the whole
[33:39.000 --> 33:43.000]  background. So she was pulling up mainstream articles from the last 15, 20 years that are
[33:43.000 --> 33:48.000]  online of where the U.N. officially calls the tetanus shot the birth control shot.
[33:48.000 --> 33:54.000]  It's official that they tell women it's a tetanus shot and they add a female hormone.
[33:54.000 --> 33:59.000]  This is official. She's writing an article about it. It's not denied that then sterilizes
[33:59.000 --> 34:03.000]  you because it attacks the gland that releases the hormone that's needed at the start of
[34:03.000 --> 34:08.000]  the second trimester. So you're not really sterilized. You have you have miscarriage
[34:08.000 --> 34:12.000]  after miscarriage after miscarriage after miscarriage.
[34:12.000 --> 34:18.000]  And they the U.N. talks it up because in Africa and Latin America and poor areas, second
[34:18.000 --> 34:24.000]  trimester miscarriages and also the inflammation in the gland can kill the woman. So it's an
[34:24.000 --> 34:33.000]  added goodie, an added goodie. And so we are being assaulted and they are aborting us as
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  adults. They are killing you with the aspartame that they're now going to put in the milk
[34:36.000 --> 34:42.000]  and dairy without telling you it's all official. It's in over 10,000 products right now and
[34:42.000 --> 34:45.000]  it absolutely kills baby Reese's monkeys.
[34:45.000 --> 34:50.000]  They're murdering us. It's fun. It's it's it's a loving government. These are nice people.
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.000]  And I think we should do whatever they say. You know, the attorney general is in the news
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.000]  saying homegrown terrorists are the main threat now. No, it's it's white al-Qaeda folks.
[34:58.000 --> 35:01.000]  They're everywhere. They think there's a new world order. They think the government wants
[35:01.000 --> 35:07.000]  to hurt us. Oh, man, they're bad people. Just take your fluoride water and take this shot
[35:07.000 --> 35:12.000]  and everything's going to be OK. All right.
[35:12.000 --> 35:18.000]  We're good people, we promise. Hey, poor folks, did you like that payroll tax increase? Because
[35:18.000 --> 35:23.000]  I promised I would raise your taxes.
[35:23.000 --> 35:30.000]  Oh, they're so lovely. Oh, they're so good. Oh, oh, the Republicans are going to save
[35:30.000 --> 35:33.000]  us. They're all bought and paid for by the very same people at the top. But there are
[35:33.000 --> 35:37.000]  a lot of House members who are anti New World Order. And so the Republican leadership is
[35:37.000 --> 35:42.000]  in the news today talking about how dreadful they are and how horrible they are.
[35:42.000 --> 35:45.000]  Well, they're not for no child left behind to federalize education, which they passed
[35:45.000 --> 35:49.000]  and paid off media to promote. Oh, and and and and they're not for bigger government
[35:49.000 --> 35:54.000]  and Homeland Security takeovers. And oh, my gosh, and they're not for the U.N. Oh, what
[35:54.000 --> 35:57.000]  are we going to do? What are we going to do? It's horrible.
[35:57.000 --> 36:05.000]  So I need to settle down. I was very calm today until I saw. Which they say has a good
[36:05.000 --> 36:15.000]  chance of passing just introduced last week. We've got SB number 63 and SB number 64. So
[36:15.000 --> 36:22.000]  your child will give consent to get an immunization that your 10 year old will give consent and
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  the parents can't say anything now.
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.000]  Now, again, this overturns even ancient Roman law, all British common law, European common
[36:28.000 --> 36:33.000]  law. You can't come to a 10 year old, say, get my truck, get my van. I got candy. And
[36:33.000 --> 36:37.000]  then some pedophile have sex with them and then say, well, the 10 year old said it was
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.000]  OK. You're going to go to prison for life.
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.000]  You can't kid give 10 or 11 year olds beer or 12 year olds or 14 year olds. That's contributing
[36:45.000 --> 36:49.000]  to the delinquency of minors if you're not their parent. I mean, this is parental consent.
[36:49.000 --> 36:54.000]  You got to get parental consent to go to the mall on a on a field trip or to go to the
[36:54.000 --> 37:01.000]  zoo or the planetarium or the art museum or the dental office or to the factory.
[37:01.000 --> 37:07.000]  Remember all those field trips in public school? And now, ladies and gentlemen, you still have
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.000]  to have that. But the state is your mommy and your daddy. The federal court ruled they
[37:12.000 --> 37:18.000]  can give your children laptops that you paid for and watch them at home without them knowing,
[37:18.000 --> 37:19.000]  well, that's not 1984.
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.000]  You see, and so many people now are scared of this or they feel powerless and they're
[37:23.000 --> 37:28.000]  like, well, I'll just go along with it. Hey, listen, dummy. So many yuppies go, oh, well,
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.000]  they're two people. Yeah. And like I said to Howard Stern the other day, I said, Howard,
[37:33.000 --> 37:34.000]  you're being hit by this, too.
[37:34.000 --> 37:38.000]  You know, did you get a warning not to drink this stuff, not to eat this stuff? And there's
[37:38.000 --> 37:46.000]  like, oh, yeah, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. You think anybody's safe with this stuff going on? And
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  it's official. And then I've got where they're going to make the pregnant women.
[37:50.000 --> 37:55.000]  You know, I have a crew member that we're going to Paul Watson. I have a crew member
[37:55.000 --> 38:01.000]  who had a child premature. His wife did right at two pounds, barely lived. And they've been
[38:01.000 --> 38:05.000]  trying for a month with this baby in the hospital to give it shots. And they say, you're not
[38:05.000 --> 38:10.000]  taking the kid because the baby girl lived, thank God, is doing good. By the grace of
[38:10.000 --> 38:14.000]  God, your prayers. Thank you for your prayers. And they said, you're not leaving and we're
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.000]  going to take the child. You don't take shots. Now, he hadn't played the card of, hey, I
[38:17.000 --> 38:21.000]  work for Alex Jones. You know, hey, I've been recording you all this. We're going to see
[38:21.000 --> 38:26.000]  what they do. But there is no law. And of course, you don't give a preemie vaccines,
[38:26.000 --> 38:32.000]  period. But see, a lot of hospitals is coming out now won't give a homeless person treatment
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.000]  when they have a heart attack.
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.000]  It's all quiet. Wink, wink, let them die. They're killing people everywhere. They're
[38:36.000 --> 38:42.000]  killing old people, you name it. And so whether they know it or not, this attitude comes with
[38:42.000 --> 38:47.000]  killing that baby. But it's the government in the hospital. So it's like, if they kill
[38:47.000 --> 38:52.000]  that baby, folks, they'll just send him to jail and his wife. The baby has the autoimmune
[38:52.000 --> 38:55.000]  response, blood on the brain, goes into convulsions.
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.000]  The cops are going to slam his face in the ground and feel good while he's going to jail.
[38:59.000 --> 39:04.000]  And if he says, hey, the shots may have killed my baby, they won't admit they've done this.
[39:04.000 --> 39:10.000]  They'll go, shut up, scum. Get your mouth shut. Because they can't admit they work for
[39:10.000 --> 39:18.000]  the people killing the baby. I've had enough of them. And you people out there who've got
[39:18.000 --> 39:23.000]  egg on your face saying, I screwed up blowing up at Piers Morgan, I wish I'd have blown
[39:23.000 --> 39:24.000]  up at him more.
[39:24.000 --> 39:29.000]  As God is my witness, I should have said, listen, you red coat trash. You've been sent
[39:29.000 --> 39:34.000]  here to disarm us and I know it and I see through you. I know, so stop playing games
[39:34.000 --> 39:40.000]  with me. I held back and I shouldn't have. But it still got the sleeping giant to kind
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  of halfway wake up out of its trance.
[39:42.000 --> 39:47.000]  Our forebears went through a lot less than this. And they were getting armed going around
[39:47.000 --> 39:54.000]  saying, it's time to fight back. It's time to kill people. And we're like, Paul Revere,
[39:54.000 --> 39:58.000]  George Washington. I'm simply saying, don't let him give your kids shots. Here's the evidence.
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.000]  Please listen to me. It's like, that guy's extreme. That guy's, of course you bet I'm
[40:02.000 --> 40:08.000]  extreme, man. I got empathy that's deep. I'm not a mile wide and inch deep, folks. I'm
[40:08.000 --> 40:11.000]  a mile wide and a million miles deep.
[40:11.000 --> 40:20.000]  And you are too, you just don't know it. This gets to me. This freaks me out. This is normal.
[40:20.000 --> 40:30.000]  This is normal. This is normal. I care enough about freedom cuz I don't wanna be a slave.
[40:30.000 --> 40:35.000]  I'm not a hero. This is normal. Ladies and gentlemen, I care enough about the future.
[40:35.000 --> 40:40.000]  I care enough about our society. I care enough about our culture and the pure evil not be
[40:40.000 --> 40:41.000]  able to take over.
[40:41.000 --> 40:47.000]  And it's not even fear, but there is that, my God, it's gonna get really bad. It's self
[40:47.000 --> 40:52.000]  preservation. Cuz it's not a fear. It's I better resist these people. I better figure
[40:52.000 --> 40:59.000]  out the best way to fight them. I better really tell people how it is instead of mincing words.
[40:59.000 --> 41:06.000]  Go to Watson here in a minute. I just read these bills and then I've got the UN bragging
[41:06.000 --> 41:15.000]  here and the CDC. Update on immunization and pregnancy tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis vaccination
[41:15.000 --> 41:21.000]  recommended for women. Update on immunization pregnancy.
[41:21.000 --> 41:26.000]  See, they still at the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, they hadn't
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.000]  gotten with the program four years ago as saying, give pregnant women shots. Everybody
[41:30.000 --> 41:35.000]  knew you didn't do that. Cuz I mean, they used to do it when they had miscarriages or
[41:35.000 --> 41:40.000]  the baby died and then had to be removed.
[41:40.000 --> 41:45.000]  It's an abortion. And they said, well, now we're saying give it all, especially to women,
[41:45.000 --> 41:55.000]  even though they go on to admit that it can hurt the baby. See, the Aztecs said we're
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.000]  gonna chop people's hearts out. It was normal cuz everybody went along with it. And if you
[41:58.000 --> 42:04.000]  showed up, they had normalcy bias and if you could speak Mayan, the overculture and you
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  said, hey, don't chop their hearts out.
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.000]  The moon is a big rock that orbits our planet. It's not a god. You don't have to chop hearts
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.000]  out every time the moon comes up or the sun comes up. It's a gas ball. They would say
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.000]  you're crazy. We all agree that the god needs the blood of children and women and men. And
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  they also sold the meat. They hung the folks up like lunch meat. And that was how the priest
[42:25.000 --> 42:30.000]  classmate, their money was off the sale of human flesh.
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  You would be crazy, just like I'm crazy. I'm like, this is really bad, folks. They're like,
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.000]  those are doctors. They care about the children. I'm like, really? Here's the document where
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.000]  they're killing you. And the average doctor doesn't even know. They're just compartmentalized
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.000]  idiots. And the kid has a convulsion. Now they're telling doctors, cuz they're souping
[42:45.000 --> 42:46.000]  up the vaccines.
[42:46.000 --> 42:51.000]  This came out last year. It's normal. Tell people that a convulsion may be normal. But
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.000]  if your kid has a convulsion, when you take them out of the hospital, which happens most
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.000]  of the time, about ten hours later, eight hours later, they're gonna take your kids,
[42:58.000 --> 43:03.000]  even if they live. Now they're gonna tell you, now there may be a convulsion. When you
[43:03.000 --> 43:09.000]  go in, you're sitting there. Now, your baby may have a convulsion tonight, okay? Or even
[43:09.000 --> 43:14.000]  today, it's quite normal. Hey, there you go. Thank you very much for visiting. Thank you,
[43:14.000 --> 43:19.000]  doctor, in your priest suit, your white priest robe. Thank you, Lucifer. Wearing a Lucifer
[43:19.000 --> 43:24.000]  robe. Thank you, Lucifer, in your white robes. Saturday is the black robes of the judge.
[43:24.000 --> 43:29.000]  Thank you, Lucifer. Wearing a Lucifer rug. Wearing a Lucifer robe. I mean, see, that's
[43:29.000 --> 43:33.000]  what's wrong when you know all this stuff. It's all symbols. It's all in your face, the
[43:33.000 --> 43:35.000]  double snakes, the helix and the DNA.
[43:35.000 --> 43:40.000]  They knew that thousands of years ago. They didn't just discover that. You got these dumb
[43:40.000 --> 43:46.000]  down lower level priest class doctors who don't even know what they're part of. And
[43:46.000 --> 43:51.000]  we have to sit here and watch all of this unfold and watch all of this go on. I'm tired
[43:51.000 --> 44:00.000]  of it. I've had enough of it. They're killing us. Look at the numbers. They're killing us.
[44:00.000 --> 44:06.000]  CBS News, aspartame gives you top new diabetes. But Michelle Obama, she says cut your calories,
[44:06.000 --> 44:09.000]  not, hey, you can't have aspartame.
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.000]  If they came out and said that, I'd be like, whoa, okay, okay, they're not bad. They're
[44:13.000 --> 44:19.000]  waking up to eugenics. They're not. They are eugenicist. And so all these bills are being
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.000]  introduced. All this is happening. It passed in California. They give little kids shots.
[44:23.000 --> 44:28.000]  Do you want a shot? Do you want the candy? You don't want to die, do you? I guess all
[44:28.000 --> 44:33.000]  right, I'll take the shot. All right, now you could get a little sick.
[44:33.000 --> 44:39.000]  They have them sign a form. That's in this bill. To your 10 year old, sign the form.
[44:39.000 --> 44:45.000]  Imagine the devil coming to a 10 year old. You sign the contract. You can't give consent.
[44:45.000 --> 44:51.000]  A 10 year old can't walk into a Corvette dealership and say, I want that $70,000 Corvette and
[44:51.000 --> 44:56.000]  sign their name. They can't walk into a liquor store. They can't walk in and buy a gun. They
[44:56.000 --> 45:01.000]  don't have the age of consent. They don't have the age of consent. They don't have the
[45:01.000 --> 45:04.000]  age of consent. They don't have the age of consent.
[45:04.000 --> 45:10.000]  I mean, this is literally like the government acting like a pedophile. And then they just
[45:10.000 --> 45:14.000]  do it. All right, I'm gonna shut up and go to Paul Watson. This is big breaking news.
[45:14.000 --> 45:20.000]  And Paul, later in the article you break down, as we have documented over the past part of
[45:20.000 --> 45:26.000]  the decade, Internet Plan B or Internet 2 would be a perfect excuse for authoritarians
[45:26.000 --> 45:30.000]  to replace the current Wild West Internet system with a newly regulated censored structure
[45:30.000 --> 45:35.000]  under which everyone would require permission and approval to operate a website.
[45:35.000 --> 45:41.000]  Well, that's what they say since 2000 at Internet 2 Consortium. And I know you linked a couple
[45:41.000 --> 45:46.000]  of our old articles here. But I want you or Steve or somebody to come out with another
[45:46.000 --> 45:51.000]  headline explaining that protecting the Internet is the plan to kill the Internet because they've
[45:51.000 --> 45:59.000]  said that. And then the threats they talk about now in this new fear mongering are threats
[45:59.000 --> 46:04.000]  that they're engineering and saying, the power systems on the Internet, not true.
[46:04.000 --> 46:08.000]  The gas systems on the Internet, not true. And then they use case point examples to put
[46:08.000 --> 46:13.000]  their hub in to kill the old Internet, to shut it down with red tape, and then force
[46:13.000 --> 46:18.000]  us on to the new highly controlled one. They say that. And this is not anywhere in the
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  technology publications. So we need to get this out.
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  But Paul Watson, I wanted you to comment on your tech guru warns of Internet disaster
[46:26.000 --> 46:31.000]  scientist Danny Hillis calls for Internet plan B in times of emergency. He's one of
[46:31.000 --> 46:36.000]  the backbone real consortium inventors of the Internet. And of course, he's out fear
[46:36.000 --> 46:40.000]  mongering for him saying Stuxnet. We need to have the feds take over cybersecurity when
[46:40.000 --> 46:45.000]  cybersecurity launched Stuxnet in a false flag operation. Paul Watson.
[46:45.000 --> 46:53.000]  This is an interview that Danny Hillis, who basically created some of the first super
[46:53.000 --> 47:00.000]  computers at MIT. He gave an interview to Michael Copeland of wired.com. And he said,
[47:00.000 --> 47:06.000]  the threat is that there's gonna be this massive denial of service attack on the entire Internet.
[47:06.000 --> 47:10.000]  Offered no proof for that. Of course, we know the Internet's not-
[47:10.000 --> 47:15.000]  And Homeland's putting grids now, microgrids in to be able to do that. It's their Internet
[47:15.000 --> 47:20.000]  kill switch on record. See, they couldn't shut it down. Now they are setting it up to
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.000]  do that and then claim someone else did it.
[47:22.000 --> 47:30.000]  Well, the new cybersecurity regulations that a lot of the major infrastructure companies
[47:30.000 --> 47:37.000]  and bodies are having to adhere to are all based around the fact that the DHS invents
[47:37.000 --> 47:42.000]  and runs all the regulations. But yeah, they're gonna be running a huge part of it. But he
[47:42.000 --> 47:48.000]  basically said that we need a new Internet to kind of kick in as a backup generator if
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  the original one goes down.
[47:50.000 --> 47:54.500]  Hey, this restaurant isn't working well that builds its own self and is the real World
[47:54.500 --> 47:57.500]  Wide Web. We're gonna build a new one next door and then, by the way, somebody's gonna
[47:57.500 --> 48:00.000]  burn down the old one. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[48:00.000 --> 48:06.000]  And he says that hygiene will be required. And what that's gonna look like, basically,
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  you know what it's gonna look like-
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  Internet ID, Internet taxes, total control.
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.000]  Yes, the Chinese system is the very thing Lieberman called for. I mean, it's insane.
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.800]  You were talking about the denials over the bullet purchases. When Lieberman was pushing
[48:19.800 --> 48:24.300]  the Chinese-style Internet, he called the concerns that it was gonna be a Chinese-style
[48:24.300 --> 48:30.500]  Internet, quote, total misinformation. And then a day later, he goes on CNN and says,
[48:30.500 --> 48:36.200]  why can't we shut down the Internet like China can into times of emergency?
[48:36.200 --> 48:40.800]  So on the one hand, they call you a paranoid nutcase for being concerned about it. Then
[48:40.800 --> 48:45.500]  the next day, they come out and say that very thing. So that's precisely what it's gonna
[48:45.500 --> 48:46.500]  be, but-
[48:46.500 --> 48:51.300]  There's even CNET news of CBS admitted and Declan McCulloch that the cybersecurity plan
[48:51.300 --> 48:55.300]  they've wanted that Congress wouldn't pass, so Obama just says he's doing it. That's dictatorship,
[48:55.300 --> 48:59.300]  but we're extreme for not liking it. Take your tetanus shot, folks, time to die. I mean,
[48:59.300 --> 49:04.000]  that's no big deal either. Everything's fine, nothing to worry about, hidden in plain view.
[49:04.000 --> 49:10.300]  That is exactly what their cybersecurity plan does is, quote, Chinese-style net censorship.
[49:10.300 --> 49:15.500]  Well this is a quote from the New York Times, an editorial in 2009. What a new Internet
[49:15.500 --> 49:20.400]  might look like is still widely debated, but one alternative would, in effect, create a
[49:20.400 --> 49:27.200]  gated community where users would give up their anonymity and certain freedoms in return
[49:27.200 --> 49:28.640]  for safety.
[49:28.640 --> 49:33.540]  So that's exactly what it is. It's the end of anonymity, it's permission, it's a license
[49:33.540 --> 49:34.540]  to use the Internet.
[49:34.540 --> 49:38.760]  And then they kill the old web and force you on, and they always make the new slave system
[49:38.760 --> 49:44.200]  the new trendy fashion thing of, I'm having my feet bound so I can't walk, I'm upper class
[49:44.200 --> 49:49.540]  Chinese. Or, you know, I'm killing my baby girl, that's trendy. Or an abortion's trendy.
[49:49.540 --> 49:53.300]  Hey, sticking your hand in a blender, it's so trendy. Slitting your throat is so trendy.
[49:53.300 --> 49:54.300]  Go ahead.
[49:54.300 --> 50:00.460]  Yeah, it's going to be a no-fly list for cyberspace. And what's rich about it, this is what this
[50:00.460 --> 50:04.440]  tech guru talks about, one of the reasons why they want it, is because of all these
[50:04.440 --> 50:10.580]  viruses that have emerged in the last few years. The last five of which, as were admitted,
[50:10.580 --> 50:16.540]  were created by the US and Israel. Flames, Stuxnet, and the last three that emerged last
[50:16.540 --> 50:18.940]  year, all created by the US and Israel.
[50:18.940 --> 50:23.980]  So they're saying we need a new Internet, a new secure Internet with no freedoms because
[50:23.980 --> 50:28.900]  of cybersecurity. And then they're launching all the cybersecurity attacks.
[50:28.900 --> 50:33.820]  Hey, hey, Kurt, four years ago wrote an article where the head of cybersecurity in the Pentagon,
[50:33.820 --> 50:37.780]  they've already set it up, said we're going to attack the web and force you on the new
[50:37.780 --> 50:41.300]  one. I mean, they're admitting it. Stay there, Paul. I want to finish up with this. Folks,
[50:41.300 --> 50:47.100]  this is so big. Paul, your headline should be Obama launches false flags on the Internet
[50:47.100 --> 50:52.060]  in bid to take it over. I mean, that's what it is. So I want another article just on what
[50:52.060 --> 50:56.060]  you just said. Your article is great, but I mean, it's not hardcore. You go with the
[50:56.060 --> 51:01.360]  enemy's headline. Reality is 10 times worse. Stay with us.
[51:01.360 --> 51:05.540]  Your freedoms are on the line. The Second Amendment is in danger. How soon before your
[51:05.540 --> 51:10.400]  freedoms are taken away? What can you not live without? What is your greatest dependency?
[51:10.400 --> 51:15.860]  Is it your guns? Is it your home? No, it's food. It all boils down to the food supply.
[51:15.860 --> 51:20.620]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply. Don't be dependent. Be
[51:20.620 --> 51:25.320]  self-sufficient. Don't wait for the government to feed you. Feed yourself. I can warn you,
[51:25.320 --> 51:30.300]  but I can't feed you. Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from e Foods Direct.

[54:06.920 --> 54:11.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, what's happening is really very simple. The complexity of the
[54:11.880 --> 54:20.360]  world is so massive and deep that people just give up and say, hey, I just get my car drive
[54:20.360 --> 54:25.080]  to work, come home. And while you're doing that, the technocrats are putting out propaganda
[54:25.080 --> 54:29.640]  about party, have fun, everything's silly. Everybody's silly. Let's be silly. Everybody's
[54:29.640 --> 54:36.080]  friendly. Well, it's just hardcore pure evil beyond Hades. I mean, it is the mind of the
[54:36.080 --> 54:43.640]  devil is all I can describe this as. And those of us that study it are just like, whoa. I
[54:43.640 --> 54:47.520]  mean, yeah, they launched the five attacks, admit they launch them and then say, as I
[54:47.520 --> 54:50.960]  predicted, we've got to take your Internet freedom and put you on Internet too because
[54:50.960 --> 54:53.480]  of these attacks.
[54:53.480 --> 55:00.360]  In one case, they even blamed Iran for Stuxnet. Again, they go, Alex Jones is discredited.
[55:00.360 --> 55:05.260]  Yeah, I bought the bullets. And he goes, yeah, we bought 200,000. And it mentions one tiny
[55:05.260 --> 55:09.240]  little line from purchases and goes, she's worried about that. That's only a few bullets
[55:09.240 --> 55:13.480]  for the officers of the Social Security Administration. What's the big deal?
[55:13.480 --> 55:19.520]  Politico did it again today. Feds, media rebut Sarah Palin's stockpiling bullets claim. Of
[55:19.520 --> 55:23.480]  course, she said feds are stockpiling bullets for civil unrest. No kidding, that's what
[55:23.480 --> 55:27.200]  they're training for too. That's what the manual say, we know. But they count on your
[55:27.200 --> 55:29.440]  ignorance and go, hey, there's no drones.
[55:29.440 --> 55:33.160]  Gibbs is like, yeah, the public's idiots. I told them there were no drones. Even though
[55:33.160 --> 55:42.080]  they did it. That's a good one. Yeah, Alex is a kook. Yeah, there's no bullets. I mean,
[55:42.080 --> 55:47.200]  that's creepville, folks. That's creepville. I mean, Politico, what a joke. And everything's
[55:47.200 --> 55:49.840]  getting worse cuz all the standards are gone.
[55:49.840 --> 55:54.160]  And they've told the media, you will do whatever we say or you'll never get access to us. So
[55:54.160 --> 55:58.280]  Politico's like, well, I'll lie and say whatever you want then. They're like, all right, you
[55:58.280 --> 56:02.820]  get the access back. See, this technocracy, none of you are gonna be needed. All of you
[56:02.820 --> 56:03.820]  that serve the system.
[56:03.820 --> 56:09.400]  I'm going back to Watson, don't forget infowarsstore.com, infowarshop.com, the Propior Water filters

[56:47.080 --> 56:51.780]  joining us in the next hour. But I've been ranting, keep going with what's in your key
[56:51.780 --> 56:57.960]  article at prisonplanet.com. Tech guru warns of internet disaster. The answer is give the
[56:57.960 --> 57:02.080]  government all the power and select corporations. Go ahead.
[57:02.080 --> 57:09.560]  Well, the point of it is, you know, the biggest objections to the 15th century Gutenberg press
[57:09.560 --> 57:15.240]  came from organizations in positions of power. Because before that, all the books were written
[57:15.240 --> 57:20.880]  by hand. This allowed books to be written and published quicker, circulated to more
[57:20.880 --> 57:26.240]  people. They no longer controlled the flow of information. The internet is the 21st century
[57:26.240 --> 57:30.680]  Gutenberg press and it's got the potential to be so much more. That's why they wanna
[57:30.680 --> 57:35.840]  shut it down. They wanna strangle independent voices, bloggers, alternative media. They
[57:35.840 --> 57:40.040]  wanna give you approval like, you know, you're on a no-fly list to use the internet in the
[57:40.040 --> 57:45.840]  first place. No due process. The entire Magna Carta overthrown. And this is the essence.
[57:45.840 --> 57:49.800]  Now that they know that we know they're liars, they're now going to the psychological tactic
[57:49.800 --> 57:54.520]  of gaslighting where they just openly lie in front of us, admit they're lying and laugh
[57:54.520 --> 57:59.200]  to make you feel helpless. I don't think it's gonna work.
[57:59.200 --> 58:04.640]  It's amazing. I mean, this Sarah Palin thing, just to touch on it, there's an article on
[58:04.640 --> 58:09.640]  Slate entitled Sarah Palin's new conspiracy theory was debunked before she even wrote
[58:09.640 --> 58:15.520]  about it. And they say that the origin of the feds buying bullet was an anonymous email
[58:15.520 --> 58:18.000]  that began making the rounds this past summer.
[58:18.000 --> 58:22.920]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're running a hoax. Stay there. They're running a hoax. Exactly.
[58:22.920 --> 58:26.720]  On record, it's the federal purchase orders. It's all been admitted for a year. It's up
[58:26.720 --> 58:31.960]  to 2 billion bullets, AP Reuters. And now they're saying Sarah Palin's insane off a
[58:31.960 --> 58:38.280]  rumor there are no bullets when it's all admitted. There are no drugs, there are no cancer viruses,
[58:38.280 --> 58:43.280]  and the vaccines.
[58:43.280 --> 58:51.160]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:51.160 --> 58:56.560]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles and fungus can inflict severe

[59:53.600 --> 01:00:05.360]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:12.200]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:21.480]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:28.880]  Yeah, I'm ranting and raving and I called Paul this morning and I said, look, he wrote
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.400]  the Sarah Palin article about her warning about the feds getting ready for civil war.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:37.800]  And I said, do you know it's all over the authoritarian news that camouflages itself
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:44.400]  as liberal? The pinhead propagandist Winston Smith's there in the Ministry of Truth. Did
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.600]  you know that they're saying that there are no bullets? See, they've gone from just taking
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:52.600]  billions and looking at a few hundred thousand here and saying, that's all there is. That's
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:57.920]  not that many bullets, ignoring all the other purchases, lying by omission to their audience.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.000]  And now they've just gone to, there are no bullets. It's insane. Yeah, yeah, that's in
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.880]  Politico too, Paul. They all rewrite some White House memo. I'm telling you, I've never
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:07.880]  seen such plagiarism.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:14.600]  I don't know who the plagiar is. Washington Post, AP, Politico, Slate, it's all the same
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:20.200]  thing. In some cases, the same sentences without attribution, just saying there are no bullets,
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:25.000]  Paul. It doesn't matter if the government's already responded why they bought 2 billion.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.920]  It doesn't exist. You understand that, Paul? You wanna apologize?
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:32.200]  On the one hand, they say it's not happening. Then they say, well, yeah, they did buy all
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:36.440]  these bullets. Then on the one hand, they say, it's to save money buying in bulk. And
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:40.680]  then on the other hand, they say, it's just for training practice. I noticed that none
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:46.880]  of them reported on the fact that a $2 million DHS contractor produced shooting targets of
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.440]  pregnant women, children, and gun owners.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.480]  They were all quite reserved about-
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:55.560]  No one's touched that, even though the company's confirmed it. It's admitted, listen, we never
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.720]  fire the bat beam and ask Drudge to link to something. But Palin's big news, this could
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:04.840]  really wake up a lot of mainline conservatives here. We need to do an article where we break
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:09.840]  down the whole bullet hoax, like leftist-run hoax against Palin.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.040]  Because now that Slate and others are saying there are no bullets, I mean, that really
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:18.400]  discredits them, that she made it up. And they don't even show the anonymous letter.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:23.920]  It's like, that was some guy made that up on the side of the road. It's all a huge story
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.960]  for over a year on Drudge. We broke it, and then they're acting like it doesn't exist,
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:29.960]  Paul.
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:36.000]  And they also deny that the DHS preparing for civil unrest. We had the army documents
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.240]  where they openly said they're planning to shoot rioters in America. Then the DHS itself
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:47.040]  last year bought a bunch of body armor, admittedly because it was preparing for, quote, riots
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.040]  in America.
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:53.020]  And they're buying full auto, armored vehicles, heavy tanks being delivered. I mean, it is
[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:57.760]  a mad buildup. And they're like, nothing's building up, there's no bullets. I mean, that
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:00.320]  lets you know, folks, how much danger we're in.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:05.680]  Well, they're just regurgitating what the federal government told them. Last time I
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:10.120]  checked, that wasn't journalism. You have to actually investigate the claims.
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:15.880]  They're lying, Paul. Everyone knows about the bullets. It's like saying Los Angeles
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:20.520]  doesn't exist in Politico. That's how dumb they think. This is a scandal, Paul. This
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:25.080]  is a scandal. And they wanna just get us used to it. You see all the articles, Drudge is
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:31.880]  crazy linking to this. There's no bullets. I mean, it has reached cuckoo level.
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:36.840]  Another one says, it appears Palin is joining the conspiracy mongers. Growth in the tinfoil
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:42.380]  hat business could totally offset those pesky budget cuts. So now there's no bullets whatsoever.
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:47.960]  It's all a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory. You can go on the FedBizOpps website and see
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.440]  what the DHS is buying.
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:59.520]  2 billion now, 2 billion, 2 billion. We were wrong two weeks ago saying 1.75, 2 billion.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:04.680]  But now 2 billion is the new zero, Winston. If I tell you 2 billion is zero, Winston Smith,
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:09.640]  it is. Are you saying that isn't the case? How many figures am I holding up, Paul?
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:15.960]  Well, 2 plus 2 equals 5 to the mainstream media, I guess. It's an insult to people's
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:20.560]  intelligence that they just regurgitate this crap and shovel it out every time.
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:25.880]  But notice how we're not even freaking out though. This is ball face concerted lies saying
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:31.360]  Sarah Palin is an idiot and going off an internet rumor. We've caught them in an absolute total
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:37.040]  fraud hoax. It's huge and no one even cares. They got us used to it. No one even cares
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.720]  that Gibbs is like, yeah, we lied to you all the time.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:45.400]  And MSNBC is like, it's so funny. Let me tell you another one I told the idiots. I mean,
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:49.040]  that's what they think of people. You're like, hey, you're lying. Shut up, racist. Oh, you're
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:52.680]  only being called racist. That's right, racist. Alex, you're racist because you say MSNBC
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:05:02.680]  lies. That's racist. Thank you, Paul Watson. Here comes Ted Nugent. Stay with us.

[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:31.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely excited to have the one, the only Ted Nugent joining
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:36.920]  us in a powerhouse interview. And the reason I know it's going to be a powerhouse, I had
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:41.560]  a chance to have him call in to the Sunday weekend show, listening right here in Central
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:46.160]  Texas as he was driving. And then I had a chance to talk to him off air about some of
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.720]  the other topics he wanted to come on air and talk about.
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:54.720]  So a lot of this is going to be news breaking. His new tour, the Black Power Tour, is celebrating
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:59.680]  the fathers of rock and roll, incredible black Americans. And they're demonizing that in
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:04.440]  the media. I mean, there's nothing that Ted Nugent can't do right because he's pro-liberty
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:09.200]  and the Marxist Decepticons are out there trying to divide and conquer this country.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.480]  We're going to talk about that. We're going to talk about how he's been persecuted by
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:16.200]  the feds. We're going to talk about how he's got one of the most popular ammo lines in
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:20.800]  the country. We're going to talk most importantly about taking America back. We've got him for
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:26.000]  the full hour. You want Ted Nugent? I had to do some serious begging, but we've got
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  him.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  Uncle Ted, great to have you back with us.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.920]  Well, thanks, Alex. I feel welcome. Even when I'm not here, I feel that I'm represented
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:36.640]  accurately by you. So on behalf of working hard, playing hard, logical America, thank
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:37.640]  you.
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:41.160]  Wow, where should we start? You heard some of the topics I threw out. Well, where should
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:45.320]  we begin? Let's talk about your big rock and roll tour coming up and the media trying to
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:46.320]  lie to people.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:50.640]  Well, you know, for the last, I think this is my 55th year touring, something like that.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.800]  I started back in Detroit in the 1950s. My band won the Battle of the Bands. We actually
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:10:00.880]  opened up for the Supremes and the Boat Rubbles with the brand new Cobo Hall back in 1962
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:05.920]  or 63. And I, you know, I just don't have any white musical influences. I thought Pat
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:09.520]  Boone was weird and I thought Little Richard was God. You know what I mean?
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.520]  Me too. Yeah.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:15.160]  So when I heard you reference the ultimate love songs yesterday, Free For All and Doggy
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:21.080]  Dog and Stranglehold. I mean, my music has a life of its own. Really. After 50 years
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:28.240]  of touring, the audiences still are so intense and passionate and high energy. And let's
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:34.680]  morph into when I discovered the culture war. You know, this tour is called Ted Nugent Black
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:42.000]  Power 2013 because I'm bringing forth the celebration that there really is a black thing.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.280]  And the black thing that inspired me from the very beginning was James Brown's work
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:54.680]  ethic. Little Richard's work ethic. Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley's, their work ethic.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:11:00.240]  You can't become the fathers, the gods of thunder, of rhythm and blues and rock and
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:06.840]  roll unless you really put your nose to the grindstone and you work your ass off. My dad
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:12.560]  and mom forced us kids to do that. That was the battle cry of the American dream in the
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:20.360]  1950s and 1960s until the beatniks turned into the drooling, puking, idiot hippies.
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:25.720]  And I was always attacked in the media, even the beginning when I was just a teenager,
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:31.000]  because I was a hunter. Because I ate venison and I carried a gun and I believed in self
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:38.440]  defense. And this new curse of leftism, this Mao Tse tongue ugliness was metastasizing
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:43.240]  across America. So at first, Alex, when I did these interviews, and they would attack
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:47.960]  me because I spent the weekend at the shooting range with my dad or I spent the weekend with
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:49.880]  my family up north deer hunting.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:57.480]  I squinted and furrowed my brow and went, wait a minute, you're condemning what is obviously
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.480]  perfect self defense is perfect deer hunting.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:06.160]  So you woke up early on just because you were being yourself and being demonized. And I
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:09.160]  wanna ask you this question and then continue along the line and what the media is saying
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:12.120]  about your black power tour, because they wanna create division, they can't have us
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:13.120]  come together.
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:22.240]  Are we, yeah. But it's so incredibly simple that this country was founded on the Second
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:26.960]  Amendment, but they try to act like it's so incredibly alien. I'm tired of calling them
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:32.360]  liberals or even leftists, even though that's as they're known. These are as you said, Maoist,
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:37.960]  these are hardcore authoritarian pigs who know they're authoritarian pigs.
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:43.280]  They're not environmentalists, wackos. They're not ignorant. They're not stupid. They're
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:46.400]  criminals that wanna run our lives and make us their slaves.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:50.920]  Boy, I couldn't have said it better. They really are criminals. I don't care if it's
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:55.400]  Hillary Clinton refusing to provide security and the anniversary of 9-11 in some of the
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.400]  most dangerous areas in the world.
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:02.440]  And then getting upset because we asked her why, or that the attorney general is running
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:09.280]  guns to Mexican drug gangs, then trying to blame mom and pop gun shops for the criminality
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:14.840]  of his directive and his program. It really is like, I don't know if it's one flew over
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:19.520]  the cuckoo's nest, Soylent Green, or Planet of the Apes, but the insanity running amuck
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:25.720]  in this country right now can only be described as evil people with an evil agenda.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:31.400]  I am sick and tired. I figured like way back in the 1970s when people go, well, they're
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:36.040]  well intentioned, but they're misinformed. That's not true at all. Their intentions are
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:41.920]  evil, and they know exactly what we're doing. May I quote Nancy? You don't have to read
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:48.440]  this. You need to sign it, Pelosi. Can you get any more anti-American and anti-constitution,
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:50.720]  anti-we the people than that insanity?
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:56.520]  No, you can't. And I apologize for interrupting you and getting you off into the tyrants.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:00.400]  You are so prominent and know so many other prominent people. I think it's time to start
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:06.040]  a campaign to say, we're really the liberals. Thomas Jefferson was a liberal saying more
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:11.500]  freedom. George Washington was a liberal, meaning more freedom. I think they've stolen
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:16.440]  the term liberal or even progressive saying, let's build our country up.
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:22.680]  It's time to call them what they are. A cult, a gang of criminals that want a managed, organized
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:27.560]  economy controlled by them and their cronies. And that they have basically occupied this
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:32.000]  country and there's no living with them. We either take this country back and win the
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.560]  war or we're going to be slaves. No more win the battles and just let the enemy keep launching
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.560]  attacks.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:44.400]  It's time to go on the total offense as the gun manufacturers are doing, as you're doing,
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:48.400]  as I'm doing. That's why they're scared of us. Let's talk about Ted Nugent taking America
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:53.000]  and then the world back. How do we get on the offense? And do you agree? There's no
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  more quarter. They're not giving us quarter. We either take it all back or we're going
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  to lose.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  Well, you're absolutely correct. I think it can best be framed in the column that you
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.080]  took the other day when I dropped my cell signal. And I think it was Doug, a cross country
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:13.880]  trucker who said he was proud that Ted came over to our side. Alex, are you kidding me?
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:18.000]  I'm talking about clueless. Now, with all due respect, especially to my good trucking
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.960]  buddies who use a power service diesel additive. But can you believe that that kind of ignorance
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:29.520]  exists? That people are unaware that in the Rolling Stone cover stories on the cover of
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:35.400]  Rolling Stone with a Walther PPK that I actually had on me in New York City during the photo
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:42.320]  shoot celebrating the Second Amendment for the entire front page feature story in Rolling
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:51.800]  Stone magazine in 1978. If you go back to my interviews in 1968, 1965, I have always
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:59.240]  promoted and celebrated, never defended the obvious and unambiguous right to keep and
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:04.320]  bear arms. I have been on the front line. That's why the left and the media and what
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:10.160]  you could you're accurately identifying is the cult of denial. When you have a Valerie
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:15.320]  Jared, who is the communications czar for the president, who actually publicly quotes
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:21.600]  Mao Zedong. Are you kidding me? So I have been on the front line. So the answer to the
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:26.640]  big question, how do we take our country back? How do we get on the offensive? All you have
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:33.160]  to do is study what you and I do, study what I've done since the 1960s. You never apologize.
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:39.520]  You take the beast face to face, hand to hand, close quarter combat with the evidence from
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:43.920]  history that when there's power abuse like President Obama and Eric Holder and Hillary
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:50.000]  Clinton and all the czars and all his communist buddies, when they abuse the power and they
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:56.720]  create such a depth of corruption, if we don't communicate adamantly, firmly and politely,
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:02.040]  but consistently with our elected officials every chance we get, which we have to make
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:09.440]  the opportunity every week and demand accountability. Here's it in a nutshell. Look in a person's
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:17.040]  eye. Ask them, ask them, what do you believe about the death tax? Do you believe that the
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:25.320]  government can steal from families after tax savings when mom or dad died? Do you believe
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:32.240]  the government can steal after tax savings from a family and that that should be the
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:37.040]  law of the land? Because if the person says, yes, I believe in it, you're looking at the
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:43.280]  enemy of freedom, the enemy of America and a thief. If a person wants to get rid of the
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:48.800]  death tax, if you want to compromise gun rights, you're looking at the enemy. We don't need
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:55.040]  to compromise. When I was on Capitol Hill last week for the recently for the State of
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:59.760]  the Union address, I shook every Republican's hand and I wouldn't let go. And I tried to
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:04.960]  shake it like Chesky Fuller, looked him in the eye and went quick with the compromise.
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:12.400]  We have compromised ourselves into a corner of communism. Cut it out.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:16.640]  And that's why the Republicans haven't been getting the support they were getting because
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:22.200]  they clearly have been selling out on every front. And now we've heard this hoax of, Obama
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:27.440]  has a mandate. We need to become socialists so we can win. There's no point in having
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:31.120]  a Republican Party if they become the Democratic Party.
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:36.680]  And so how do we hold their feet to the fire? And point out that people that are quoting
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:42.400]  Mao Zedong, the greatest murderer, mass murderer in history are, as you said, the enemy. I
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:45.360]  mean, my God, it's so simple if you're informed.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:51.760]  Well, again, communication. I have been fighting this fight in the most aggressive fashion
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:57.360]  I possibly can. My wife constantly shakes her finger and go, calm down. You're not the
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:03.480]  only one taking this battle to the enemy. And I go, sometimes I think I am. Sometimes
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:08.680]  I'll contact an elected official and they act like I'm bringing up some strange concept
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:15.560]  that the Second Amendment, by any honest scrutiny, that the existence of the Second Amendment
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:20.400]  is my concealed weapons permit, period.
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:23.640]  And again, people say, well, why are you so obsessed with guns? It's the canary in the
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:28.960]  coal mine in hundreds of other countries just the last century. When they come for those,
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:33.480]  look out. And look, they're going after every other right. We're gonna go to break. We're
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:35.640]  gonna come back with Ted Nugent.
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:40.760]  He needs no introduction, tednugent.com. And I wanna get more into this tour and how the
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:44.120]  media is trying to demonize it, too. I just find that intriguing. We're gonna get to how
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:48.480]  he's been persecuted. Because believe me, I've gone through some of this, too. This
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:52.840]  is serious, folks. You've gotta support the First Amendment or we lose everything. Ted
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:57.800]  Nugent, straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones.

[01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:04.220]  My name is Steven Huir. After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:08.960]  most brain malfunctions have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage. So
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:13.040]  whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking or more serious matters
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:17.440]  like inability to focus, speak normally or remember things, the emphasis to getting one's
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:22.480]  brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification. One World Way supports your body's number
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:26.000]  one means of detoxification, which is glutathione production.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.980]  My name is Angie and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation. I got
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:35.960]  him on One World Way and in two months his constipation is gone. He has become friendlier.
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:40.800]  He can carry on a normal conversation with me and he has made his first friend. He's
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:45.300]  doing great and he looks forward to taking One World Way every day. He could offer him
[01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:49.240]  a present or a cake and he would prefer the One World Way.

[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:34.400]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engraving embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:38.720]  and carting to a private bank, having a lead back at interest, forcing taxes to service
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:42.680]  debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:46.400]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army. Hi, Ted
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:50.240]  Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:57.200]  Call for your copy, 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237,
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.920]  that's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:04.800]  It's time for a home security quiz. Answer this, what effective home security device
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:09.120]  is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:14.000]  while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:21.080]  and sells for less than $35. Yes, it's fake TV. This year about one in every 50 US homes
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:25.840]  will have a break in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:30.880]  looks like no one is home. Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:36.280]  like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV. It's like a lamp
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:41.880]  on a timer, but far more convincing. And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:47.320]  between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked. Go to faketv.com
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:24:01.960]  or call 1-877-5FAKETV, that's 877-532-5388 or go to faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:18.600]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:25.840]  That's right. Thank you for joining us. I'm going to be honest here. If it sounds like
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:34.260]  I am in awesome times of Ted Nugent, it's because I am. Because I take it personal when
[01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:40.200]  people are trying to take our little ranch we've had since Texas independence, because
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:43.640]  under the estate tax, we won't be able to keep it.
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:47.320]  In fact, it used to be a lot bigger. Most of it's been sold off because of estate taxes
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:52.960]  the last 50 years when grandparents and people die. When they're trying to take my guns and
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:57.080]  I know it's because they're authoritarians. I've read the UN treaty debates where they
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:01.040]  admit it's about a monopoly of power of the government. I take it personal. When Piers
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:05.840]  Morgan lies and says, I don't want all your guns, when Obama and all the rest of them
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:10.360]  have been on record saying they want the abolition of civilian ownership of firearms.
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:14.720]  It makes me mad. But I know they're following a blueprint of disarmament and then talking
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:19.100]  to me like I'm stupid and telling me, no, you're just a conspiracy theorist. It makes
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:25.040]  me angry. And I see somebody like Ted Nugent, hard charging seven days a week as I follow
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:29.520]  the media out there standing up for liberty for all of us.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:33.440]  Knowing if they take the Second Amendment, if they're that bold, they're gonna take everything.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:37.800]  To know that Obamacare was written to raise taxes on poor people and to screw them and
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:44.080]  to bring in socialism and death panels. Thank God Ted Nugent's upset. And listen, people
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:46.120]  say, Alex, why are you so upset?
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:50.320]  Because I'm tired of playing games. I'm tired of living in denial. This is real for me.
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:55.020]  It isn't like I'm some libertarian conservative on the air, constitutionalist, because that's
[01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:59.240]  a nice niche or something. It's my business plan, okay? I believe in liberty. It's what
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:03.220]  made America great. And the fact that there aren't more people like Alex Jones and Ted
[01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:05.240]  Nugent is the problem.
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:09.520]  You're either on offense or you're getting screwed. And the tyrants are running wild
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:14.240]  cuz they think we're a bunch of sheep, okay? And this country's on the edge of civil war.
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:17.760]  A few days ago I had Ron Paul and he said, yes, it'll cause a civil war if they come
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:21.980]  for the guns. Folks, it will. There are a large percentage of gun owners that are ready
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:25.680]  for war. I got a family, folks, I don't want this to happen.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:30.000]  But damn it, I'm not gonna back off either. Ted Nugent, this is a short segment, but on
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.160]  the subject of where this country is going, this isn't Russia or Germany. The tyrants
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:38.080]  need to know that the Second Amendment, like a time bomb, has been planted for them. And
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:42.000]  the fact that they're going after our Second Amendment has alerted the people of this country
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.600]  and the world. And I want the Marxist scum to know that they're gonna lose this fight
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:47.600]  if they start it.
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:51.440]  Now, so what do you say about waking up and being alive? I know you've been alive and
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.920]  awake forever because of where you came from. But what do you say to those that are in a
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:55.920]  damn coma?
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:00.240]  Well, first of all, the prognosis is improving every day, Alex. I'm sure you see it from
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:03.960]  your callers and the people you hang out with, especially here in the great republic of Texas.
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:10.000]  If you met my kids, my grandkids, my wife, my brothers, my sister, all my hunting buddies,
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.680]  the production team for our tetanus, the Spirit of the Wild, our Sunrise Safaris guides, all
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:19.240]  the people that we hunt with and we do all the charity work with all the children's charity.
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:23.480]  Just working hard, playing hard America, where a few years ago they might have rolled their
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:28.220]  eyes when I said you shouldn't give up Saturday night specials and that there's no such thing
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:33.060]  as cop killer bullets and that none of these guns are assault weapons. They rolled their
[01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:37.560]  eyes because they didn't understand they were ignorant. Now all of a sudden they're going,
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:42.120]  Hey, you were right. You were absolutely right. I see where this guy got in trouble because
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:47.840]  his gun had a collapsible stock in New Jersey or where this, this hero of the military was
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:53.640]  thrown in prison in Washington DC because he was legally transporting his legally owned
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:56.080]  firearms from one state to the other.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:01.420]  So this is, this is a big wake up call. As I said the other day, we should thank God
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:08.560]  almighty that he sent Piers Morgan to be our foil. I mean, this guy is too easy to beat.
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:14.400]  This guy is too easy to decapitate with his fantasy and his British cult of denial. All
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:19.120]  you have to do is like you do and I do and everybody else I've seen lately though, we'll
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:26.400]  talk about the effectiveness of various individuals in a second, but the evidence is 100% on our
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:31.200]  side. And if we are aware of that evidence and we know how to bring it to the argument,
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:35.600]  bring it to the so-called debate, as you did and I did, and more and more people are learning
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:40.680]  to do, you know, we got a, we got a hero at the NRA, Chris Cox, Wayne LaPierre is getting
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:44.440]  better all the time when it comes to standing up for what right to keep and bear arms shall
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:50.000]  not be infringed stands for. So the prognosis is increasing and getting better slowly but
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.560]  surely. But I think like we should thank God that Piers Morgan was sent down. I think we
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:05.360]  have to thank God that he sent Barack Obama because this guy is so destined to destroy
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:13.160]  everything good about America. His policies, his scam, his lying, his deceit, his state
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:19.200]  of the union, his campaigning, smart people who love to hear flowery, desirable speech
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:26.920]  are starting to realize the guy's a scam artist. And he's so arrogant in his scamming that
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:30.720]  it's become very apparent now. Let's come back and talk about that in the long segment
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:36.800]  coming up. The one, the only Ted Nugent, TedNugent.com. Get the news, the tour, the bullets, the
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:42.640]  ammo, everything at TedNugent.com. I'm jealous of that website. Man, look at that. TedNugent.com.
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:50.440]  We'll be right back. I'm Alex Jones with prisonplanet.tv and infowars.com. Stay with us. We're on
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:30:01.560]  the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Introducing Pro

[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:08.560]  and or subject to other police action. Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:14.160]  has become reality. It really says that the state is God. The United States is now recognized
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:19.480]  globally as one of the most impressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:24.640]  the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:28.800]  documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all
[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:33.700]  powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:39.800]  has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers,
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:45.360]  sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:50.840]  the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's

[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:49.760]  I still believe. It was like a crime to turn down a Ted Nugent song. Whenever I'm in the
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:55.160]  car, stranglehold probably one of the greatest if not the greatest. Yeah, I got to ask you
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:58.920]  here before we get back into the news and some really hardcore stuff. How did you come
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:06.760]  up with stranglehold? I mean, were you channeling the almighty or something? I mean, that song
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:08.760]  is so perfect. How did you do that, Ted Nugent?
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:14.880]  It is a powerful lick. You should see it from where I'm sitting. When I play that lick every
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:21.240]  night, my band's too, Alex. I've got to give a big salute to the greasiest, blackest gods
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:27.040]  of thunder in the world. Mick Brown on drums, Greg Smith on bass guitar, and Derek St. Holmes
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:33.880]  on vocals and guitar. I have every guitar player's dream, every concert, every song,
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:38.400]  every audience. This year we're going on the tour with Styx and Ariel Speedwagon. We call
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:44.880]  the tour Ted Nugent Black Power because we're inspired. The stranglehold lick is a variation
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:49.160]  of all those black heroes, whether Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, James Brown,
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:54.440]  Wilson Pickett, Sam and Dave, Stax Bolt, all things Motown and Funk Brothers. There's a
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:59.560]  grind factor that I was weaned on as a little kid in Detroit. And when I pick up, I could
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:05.000]  go across the room right now and grab one of my guitars. They're all plugged into amplifiers
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:10.480]  right now. And I could just pick it up and whip out a lick that would make you grind
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:18.040]  like an animal during the rut. I've been cleaning this over for 64 years. And when you're cleaning
[01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:23.080]  this over, you really tune in when you get to jam with Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley and
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:29.160]  play with D.B. King. Are you kidding me? You pick up, you kind of sponge the essence of
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:34.800]  that soul. And let's identify what that black music ultimately represented in its origins.
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:43.120]  Defiance. Defiance against slavery. Defiance against oppression. Defiance against your
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:50.040]  own black people shackling you and selling you as a slave. That's where that unbelievable
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:55.080]  James Brown work ethic came from. They all rose up and went, yeah, you think you could
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:36:00.000]  keep me down? Well, listen to this, mother. And I'm going to play some licks that everybody's
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:05.200]  going to dance to. And that's what we do to this day. So I'm very inspired by freedom,
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:11.080]  that uppity black spirit of my original inspirations. And we pay homage to it every night on stage.
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:14.960]  And I name them by name, and I've been doing it for 50 years.
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:20.440]  And by the way, you mentioned this to me earlier, but I just punched it in Black Power Ted Nugent.
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:25.360]  The media is freaking out. You've been saying this for 40 something years that this is what
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:30.320]  inspires you, your band, all of it. But the so-called left, the tyrants who say you don't
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:34.760]  like socialism, don't like gun control, it's racism, has no connection to reality, not
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:36.040]  even any facts.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:40.500]  They just throw the word out there. They're the real race pimps. Margaret Sanger saying
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:44.080]  we've got to become liberals and take over to abort the black babies. What do you say
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:50.640]  to the media freaking out over your black power 2013? I mean, from my research, the
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:54.760]  so-called left are really the proto-Nazis.
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:37:00.040]  The left in America and England created the eugenics that Hitler picked up. The truth
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:03.560]  is they claim that they're the anti-racist because they're the racist.
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:08.760]  Well, I think the biggest racist in the world would either be President Obama. I mean, when
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:13.440]  you say Trayvon Martin could have been my son. Well, with all due respect, Mr. President,
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:18.640]  Brian Terry could have been my son. And your Eric Holder sold the guns to the gangs that
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:25.800]  killed him. Try that on precise. Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, Louis Farrakhan, number one
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:34.080]  cause of black death in America, not the subhuman crew clutch Klan. Black Americans kill more
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:40.360]  black Americans on a weekly basis than the Klan ever did in a year.
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:42.560]  It's incredible and then- It really is incredible.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:47.960]  And then you can't even have a tour paying homage to your music roots. It just shows
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:51.800]  how sick these people are. They never want people to really come together under freedom.
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:56.280]  Now expanding on this, you mentioned the fact that the NRA's getting on the offense. When
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:02.080]  we have the memos that they want to confiscate our guns, when it's on record, you use the
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:07.400]  truth to defeat them. And during the break we were talking, you described as Republicans
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:12.580]  are more worried about adjusting their tie than actually being patriots.
[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:16.040]  Expand on that. I mean, look, it's time to stop debating all their fake arguments about
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:20.840]  the children. They want our guns because they want a monopoly of power. And I think that's
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:26.360]  the key to the offense is pointing that out. Well, when I criticize the failures of the
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:33.080]  GOP, only the guilty need to feel guilty. We have some incredible leaders in this country
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:39.360]  right now, especially which is why now I'm a Texan. I came to Texas 10 years ago because
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:44.200]  the wonderful, glorious work epicenter of Detroit that I grew up in turned into the
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:49.000]  hell zone of pimp's horse and welfare brats because of liberal Democrats like Mayor Coleman
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  Young and Mayor Kwame Kirkpatrick and Jennifer Granholm. So I came to Texas where we have
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:01.640]  genuine statesmen, genuine patriots who understand they serve we the people and the U.S. Constitution.
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:06.360]  Governor Perry is the best governor in America. Greg Abbott is the best attorney general in
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:14.080]  America. Ron Paul, Ted Cruz, John Cronin, there's so many great, great constitutional
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:19.160]  representatives here in Texas. And John Thune in South Dakota. Mike Rogers up in Michigan.
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:26.280]  And Scott Walker now in Wisconsin. We see an improvement or return to the common sense.
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:32.600]  Exactly. So let me ask you this in their guiding light that they have to make an oath to to
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:38.320]  become elected officials. That's the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights. So the once
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:45.360]  again, and I can't repeat this often enough. So many people who set their alarm clocks
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:50.400]  and bust their ass to be the best that they can be. They work. They work. They make ends
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:55.840]  meet. They save for a rainy day. They demand accountability and productivity by their sons
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:59.680]  and everybody in their family. That's how the Nugent family operates. That's how the
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:05.600]  Alex Jones family operates. But a lot of those people don't vote. A lot of those people don't
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:09.520]  communicate. They don't even know who their senator or their congressman is. So we the
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:15.840]  people who want upgrade and return to a U.S. constitutionally driven America, we have got
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:20.320]  to communicate with our elected officials because some of the elected officials that
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:25.680]  I just named by name, there are some of those in every state, even California, New Jersey
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:32.280]  and New York and Illinois. They got these people, but they don't hear from us. So until
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:37.400]  you are an actual participant in the sacred experiment, self-government, I'd like to thank
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:41.440]  you for nothing. I agree with you and look at the areas like
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:47.460]  Chicago and L.A. and the areas that these authoritarians that call themselves liberals
[01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:52.120]  are in control. They bankrupt and destroy every city, every county, every state, every
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:56.800]  country they run because they are con artist criminals.
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:01.680]  And again, it's time for us to stop apologizing about the fact that we're right. It's time
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:06.960]  for us to stand up and call these crooks out. And that's why they say, you're discredited
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:12.440]  yelling at Piers Morgan or Ted Nugent, told him get off people's backs and shut the hell
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:19.760]  up. And that you're basically full of crap. Ted's discredited. No, we're the only people
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:22.400]  waking people up out of their coma.
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:27.960]  And the fact that the so-called left is saying don't get angry, that shows they're scared
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:34.440]  of us getting angry. Absolutely, and you gotta admit, Alex, I wish I could name all of them,
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:41.240]  but everybody's got a different role and everybody's got a different style and a different approach.
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:45.800]  But you really have to hand it to whether you like it or not. Sean Hannity and Rush
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:54.060]  Limbaugh and Glenn Beck and so many of these guys out there and Laura Ingraham and Monica
[01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:59.680]  Crowley. I mean, so many of our side now have more and more of a voice and they are wielding
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:06.040]  the crowbar more than just the sweetie pie attitude that has opened the door for the
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:11.240]  tyrants to crush us to this degree. So yes, it's time to get tough. It doesn't mean you
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:16.400]  have to start punching or shooting, but you have to escalate the debate so that the enemy
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:22.240]  can't control things. I've been in every media, I do media every day, and anybody that has
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:28.440]  ever messed with me has lost because I have all the evidence to support what I stand for
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:33.920]  because I stand for the self-evident truth and being the best that you can be. And if
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:39.800]  you want to find out where Obama is taking America, check out his home gangster acorn
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:47.520]  hell of Chicago. Chicago has been run by Democrats forever. They're either all in prison or they're
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:53.400]  encouraging the shooting of their citizens. They have a gun-free zone where more innocent
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:59.760]  lives are lost every day than in any high-carrying concealed weapon jurisdiction in this country.
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:05.360]  And they won't admit it. They keep doing the same thing, claiming they want different results
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:13.440]  that is not only disingenuous, that is rotten to the core. They hate freedom and they love
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:16.200]  abuse of power.
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:20.480]  They do, and that's why they're scared of us waking up out of our coma. Ted Nugent joins
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:25.400]  us, tednugent.com. If you're just now tuning in again, I'm Alex Jones with mfoldwars.com.
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:31.480]  Ted, where do you think America will be if people don't stand up and don't take action,
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:35.900]  which is starting to happen? But if people don't stand up and really get in the face
[01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:40.600]  of this tyranny and back it off, because by getting aggressive politically, with the First
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:43.480]  Amendment, we won't have to use the second.
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:48.160]  But what is your concern? Cuz again, as I said earlier, I had Ron Paul on a few days
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:52.640]  ago and he's concerned about civil war. It appears to a lot of sociologists and people
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:58.760]  that study this, that the leftists want to start some type of conflict and then brand
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:03.280]  the Patriots as the Homeland Security documents under Obama's state, that Al-Qaeda is not
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:04.280]  the threat.
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:08.400]  Now it's gun owners, conservatives, returning veterans. They're clearly trying to brand
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:14.240]  it. An article came out yesterday where Homeland Security is buying drones and in the training
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:20.260]  video, they're going around looking for people selling guns to their neighbors. So we see
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:24.360]  that the Patriot American is the new target of Homeland Security.
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:29.840]  What can you say about that and how it segues into some of the persecution you've gone through?
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:32.440]  Tell us what's been happening to you the last few months.
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:37.520]  Well, gee, there's so many issues there. Number one, thank you for bringing these things up
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:41.560]  because now people can Google and they go to your website. And if you go to TedNugent.com,
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:47.000]  I would welcome you. I would love to have you as part of our TedNugent.com talkback.
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:53.720]  We have some hardcore gung ho, great American families on my talkback on my website. And
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:58.200]  we get all this latest update too. And we make sure that we review it. We got people
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:03.640]  inside the deepest security in the United States government that are on my talkback.
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:10.120]  We have friends at most federal agencies and at every department of every political activity
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:19.160]  in every state. And we're looking with a genuine spirit of concern and a genuine duty to participate
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:25.840]  as we the people to ask questions and demand answers. And we got this far down the totem
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:30.440]  pole. We've gotten this bad off and we've been abused and the corruption has gotten
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:35.640]  this outrageous because so many Americans were disengaged. They bent over and they couldn't
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:40.200]  believe that a government would hurt someone. I'll never forget the interview with the lady
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:45.080]  who was in Rwanda checking out some gorillas or something. And I mean the real gorillas,
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:52.360]  not the gorilla fighters, the gorillas in the mist. And she was crying because the gangsters
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:58.600]  in Rwanda who had attacked their bus and killed everybody, she actually went, I can't believe
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:08.040]  that a human being would intentionally hurt another human being. Really? It's so naive.
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:16.120]  That kind of brain dead soullessness has horribly taken place and taken root and metastasized
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:22.440]  here in America. So I know about the drones, I know about the militarization of law enforcement,
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:29.320]  but I'm not going to guess what might happen if Obama's dream of tyranny comes true. I
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:33.840]  believe that more and more people are waking up. I believe that more and more people are
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:39.040]  communicating these serious issues about accountability and what happened in Benghazi and Fast and
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:46.000]  Furious, the crime of Obamacare, the abuse of power and the corruption, the absolute
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:52.400]  proven lies of every word out of this president's mouth at the last State of the Union address.
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:58.080]  I believe that we are going to vote these bastards out, that we're going to demand accountability
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:02.560]  like they did in the ultra liberal hell zone of Michigan with the governor Rick Snyder.
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:07.040]  Now we've got a Republican, he's not a conservative, but he's way better than Jennifer Granholm.
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:12.760]  Scott Walker, huge upgrade in Wisconsin. I travel and I still rock and roll and my tour
[01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:18.520]  will take me to every state in every major city across America, again, 50 years in a
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:23.920]  row now. And when I communicate with people, Alex, I'm here to bring great, great upgrade
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:25.760]  to your attention.
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:30.600]  People are waking up and we are going to take this country back at the voting booth. That's
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:34.840]  how we're going to do it. Well, listen, I'm not bragging about this. When I tell these
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:40.200]  stories is because it's important for people to know I can now go anywhere in the country
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:43.920]  and can't walk 10 feet down the street without listeners stopping.
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:50.000]  And I'm just a little guy in all this over the years. And I went to a restaurant in Wimberley,
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:57.420]  Texas, Saturday, and there were only about 10 tables. And almost every table came over
[01:47:57.420 --> 01:48:01.920]  and wanted photos and were listeners. And I know you get the same response, it's what
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:08.040]  you're saying. It's exponential how many people are awake of every race, color and creed that's
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:09.040]  exciting.
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:13.460]  And I think the key to all this is saying, look, they want our guns to enslave us, they're
[01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:19.240]  liars, they're tyrants, just calling it like it is. People are so hungry for that. And
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:26.160]  if we just go past the hoax that, we're supposed to stand down and compromise. The other side
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:29.040]  never gives in, they just tell us to compromise.
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:32.680]  Then as you said, we bend over, but let's talk about this. I talked to you off air when
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:36.220]  you called in on the Sunday show. And you said, man, next time I come on, I'll tell
[01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:40.640]  you about the crap I've been going through. I think it's important to talk about how they
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:45.360]  spun what you said and some of the things that have happened to you and how they're
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:46.760]  trying to go after you.
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:51.080]  Because if they can take down Ted Nugent, somebody who's actually alive, whose heart
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:56.280]  is beating, and if they can demonize that, if we don't stand behind Ted Nugent, even
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:59.640]  if people don't 100% agree with you out there, they've got to stand behind you in the First
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:04.920]  Amendment. Because if they can take you down, kind of the guy up there on the point, I mean,
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:08.600]  Second Amendment, you think of Ted Nugent and George Washington.
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:12.220]  And then down the road, maybe Alex Jones and Ron Paul and the NRA. But I mean, let's say
[01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:16.920]  it, you're Mr. Second Amendment. I mean, buddy, I know you got the Second Amendment, but I
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:21.560]  hope you got bodyguards. You really are front and center. Have you realized that?
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:28.840]  Yes, I have. Over the years, I realized that when it comes to absolutely defining the God-given
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:33.960]  right to keep and bear arms, I've been on the forefront forever. And now people are
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:38.080]  realizing that the reason I'm considered an extremist to sell it is because the concept
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:41.800]  of having a free people was very extreme in 1775.
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:47.480]  Yeah, the system demonizes the founders. Yeah, the system demonizes the founders. So I'm
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:51.320]  saying you're Mr. Second Amendment, tell us about the persecution.
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:56.520]  Well, I've been a hunter my whole life. My dad raised me to be law abiding. I've been
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:02.360]  a sheriff deputy for over 34 years now. I conduct federal raids here in Texas with the
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:07.480]  FBI, the ATF, the DEA, the Texas Rangers, and the federal marshals.
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:13.920]  I've been very active, hands-on in law enforcement for over 30 years now. My point being is that
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:18.120]  you don't become a sheriff deputy. You're not invited on federal, you know, fugitive
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:22.800]  felony raids. If you're a questionable guy, you have to prove yourself. And I proved myself
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:28.520]  during my training and I've proven myself during these raids. Well, I'm solidly in the
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:33.000]  asset column, but I've always been a legal hunter. My dad said, you don't dare break
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.520]  a law. I've never hunted out of season with the wrong weapon. I've always bought every
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:42.440]  tag and every license and every permit and really watched my Ps and Qs. Well, a number
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:46.120]  of years ago, I was hunting in California. Our Ted Nugent Spirit of the Wild show on
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:51.120]  Outdoor Channel had been the number one show and outdoor hunting show for over 26 years
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:56.320]  now. Every year we become the viewer's favorite because I do it honestly. I do it documentary
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:01.320]  to style, real down to earth, natural, organic, killing your own food. And I don't play games
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:07.920]  and I don't apologize. Well, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been so infested
[01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:14.560]  with anti-hunting, anti-wildlife, anti-Ted Nugent idiots that in California, hunting
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:19.600]  an apple orchard on our TV show on Spirit of the Wild, we showed it on the air. I had
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:24.560]  bought my licenses and double checked all the legalities with the director of California
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:31.720]  Fish and Game, James Fong. Long story short, after the show aired, U.S. Fish and Wildlife
[01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:43.120]  jackbooted thugs, subhuman punks, had a 36-man, guns-drawn, pre-dawn raid on my three hunting
[01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:50.800]  buddies' homes in California based on the allegation equal to a jaywalking ticket that
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:58.560]  I was hunting over bait. Alex, they kicked down doors, they confiscated guns and bows
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:07.040]  and video cameras and telephones and computers, photographs. They abused these poor families,
[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:14.480]  100% law-abiding, never broke a law in their lives, upstanding members of the community.
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:19.280]  And then they ran and they tried to charge me with felonies claiming that somehow in
[01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:27.400]  the apple orchard, I had placed a bait, which they did all kinds of forensic soil sample
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:33.680]  tests, and they came up with nothing. But because the allegations were such a scam,
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:40.160]  it was such a trumped-up railroad witch hunt, that the attorneys in California said I could
[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:45.320]  beat it, no question, but it would cost me between a quarter and a half million dollars.
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:55.240]  And remember, a jackbooted 36-man, guns-drawn, pre-dawn raid based on a jaywalking ticket.
[01:52:55.240 --> 01:53:01.960]  It just shows what crazy authoritarians they are, and how they use regulations to harass
[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:07.440]  people, but then exempt themselves when Obama's given a half billion dollars to his buddies
[01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:13.440]  to a fake energy company. It is so amazing to watch China build three new coal power
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:18.100]  plants a week, but we're having them shut down when they're clean burning.
[01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:25.720]  They want this country bankrupted to make us dependent on them. And even on our little
[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:34.680]  ranch in East Texas, we've been hunting out there. And this is a county where my grandfather
[01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:41.120]  was the tax assessor and stuff. And now, we're here to search everything you're doing here
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:45.720]  on your ranch cuz you got hunters out here under a federal grant.
[01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:50.160]  And we found out they were harassing people everywhere, old families who have no criminal
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:56.080]  records. And it's all about government basically pissing on us to let us know, hey, you're
[01:53:56.080 --> 01:54:02.280]  a criminal, government is God. And it just really lights a fire under my butt to just
[01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:03.280]  fight that much harder.
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:08.520]  Well, and let me tell you, I've got some great friends in US Fish and Wildlife. And I'm not
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:13.680]  friends because I schmooze with them, it's because we are dedicated to conservation.
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:20.680]  So I salute the genuine and law abiding federal agents of every agency out there. But I hope
[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:24.920]  the ones that are guilty are pissed off when they hear me talk about that. Because if you're
[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:30.080]  angry at what I'm saying, that would be guilt because they're Jack Buddhist thugs.
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:36.920]  Well, the SWAT team raid is meant to chill and intimidate everybody into lying about
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:42.000]  you to throw Ted Nugent in jail. Cuz if they can get Ted Nugent, they can get everybody
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  else after that.
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:47.680]  And they tried it with my buddies, they actually reached it. Well, here's the clincher, these
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:52.560]  subhuman punks, jackbooted punks, kicked down the wrong door. And I don't know if you know
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:56.280]  anything about search warrants, but I've actually participated in a number of search warrants
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:57.280]  as the searcher.
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:05.160]  You've gotta have every description of that domicile, you've gotta have the color of brick,
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:08.720]  you have to have the color of the side, and you have to have the street numbers and how
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:14.680]  big and which way they face. You have to identify neighbor's homes. Well, these subhuman punks
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:18.560]  kicked down the wrong door and held an old widow at gunpoint-
[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:19.560]  Incredible.
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:22.920]  In Ted Nugent's stuff. She never even heard of me.
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:29.440]  Probably the only person who hadn't. Again, this is what's so crazy about it, is that
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:33.920]  they just continue to get crazier and crazier. Just like when you read the Declaration of
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:38.480]  Independence, Ted Nugent, is it not like a mirror of what we're seeing unfold now?
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:43.800]  Absolutely. And once I've said it over and over again, the Declaration of Independence,
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:51.120]  the US Constitution, the Bill of Rights. If I was dropped here naked in the year four,
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:59.800]  I could have written down all those points, even not being the victim of tyranny and oppression.
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:06.120]  I know what freedom is. It's how God designed us to be self-sufficient, rugged individualism,
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:10.920]  to pursue our individual dreams, to be an asset to the people around us-
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:11.920]  Self-evident.
[01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:17.560]  That provides us with soil and air and water and food and clothing and shelter. These are
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:22.200]  self-evident truths that our founding fathers wrote down because we wanted to send George
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:28.400]  a big middle finger message, don't tread on me. Here's what we didn't get under King George,
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:33.200]  and here's what we're gonna demand. And if you try to take any of this away from us,
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:38.380]  we will meet you at Concord Bridge, and we will blow your guts out.
[01:56:38.380 --> 01:56:43.520]  And they try to demonize you for that, but that's self-evident right to not be a slave.
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:48.320]  All the Bill of Rights the Constitution does is point out what's already there. And I loved
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:53.920]  how they tried to spin what you said about Obama. Do you have any comments on that?
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:59.360]  Well, you know, you talk about the time my friends from the Secret Service came and visited
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:00.360]  me?
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:01.360]  Yes.
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:06.840]  You don't think I'm having any fun here, do you? I gotta tell you, I wasn't there when
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:10.720]  Richard Pryor's Afro caught on fire, which was the highlight of comedy in the history
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:19.320]  of humankind. But I get such a kick out of the media just doing somersaults in their
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:26.840]  own excrement trying to attribute quotes to me that never came out of my mouth. And nowadays,
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:32.440]  of course, everything is on film and there's recorded records of everything that comes
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:39.920]  out of my mouth, yet they still lie through their teeth. So it was a pleasant experience.
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:45.880]  But again, if you're gonna take on the devil, you have got to be prepared for the devil's
[01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:57.440]  gang to misrepresent, to lie, to obfuscate, to literally go crazy trying to attribute
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:01.360]  something to you that never took place. So all I can tell you about my experience with
[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:06.200]  the Secret Service, number one, I trained with them here in Texas, and I trained with
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:11.040]  them around the country. They're actually part of the President Bush's personal counter-assault
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:16.440]  team and they trained on my ranch up here in Waco, Texas. So I knew these guys and they
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:21.720]  knew what I was made out of. And let me tell you what the bottom line is, the Secret Service
[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:28.560]  having to waste their time investigating Ted Law, biding asset to your fellow man, America
[01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:35.480]  is, they were absolutely ashamed of themselves, but they had to do it because Barbara Boxer
[01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:38.360]  and Dianne Feinstein and Sheila Jackson-Lee and-
[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:41.560]  Hold on one more second, we're gonna do five more minutes.

[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:23.160]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, the system tries to create a stereotype of myself, Ted Nugent,
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:28.120]  and others. We're people that don't wanna be slaves. I mean, I take it real personal
[02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:32.200]  when an authoritarian government tries to take over from an instinctual level, a survival
[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:35.120]  instinct, but also historically studying it.
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:41.400]  That five minutes left in overdrive here on this Thursday edition with Ted Nugent. And
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:47.000]  Ted, finishing up your Secret Service story, you got up to the point of when the Secret
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:53.080]  Service had to visit you, when the media misconstrued what you'd said last year, what happened?
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:58.080]  Well, the media, they didn't misconstrue, they intentionally lied about what I said.
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:00:59.080]  Good point.
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:05.800]  And I had a meeting with what I can only describe as the consummate professionals. These men
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:12.160]  and women of the Secret Service, the vast majority of them are absolute dedicated warriors
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:19.440]  that are standing up for we the people that are enforcing our laws and that live true
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:25.000]  to their sacred oath to the U.S. Constitution. And all of them to the man and woman, Alex,
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:30.560]  are gun guys. They love the Second Amendment, whether they're on duty or off, they're real
[02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:34.200]  gun guys. So I consider them not only friends, but blood brothers.
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:39.320]  We had a professional encounter. They had to check off the boxes because Sheila Jackson
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:45.760]  Lee and President Obama and Eric Gunrunning Holder and all his communist czars and Barbara
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:51.760]  Boxer and Dianne Feinstein and all these maniacs, they hate me so much that they forced the
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:56.520]  Secret Service to investigate me. And at the end of the meeting, they said, well, we understand
[02:01:56.520 --> 02:02:00.920]  now, Mr. Nugent, we appreciate your time and your professionalism and your courteousness.
[02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:06.240]  And we realize now that there is no threat against anybody that you did not threaten
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:10.840]  the president. And we apologize for wasting your damn time.
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:16.680]  Absolutely, which is saying the president wasted their time in a very professional way.
[02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:21.360]  In closing, I just wanna say this. I think and I want your take on it that it's backfired
[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:25.320]  that they're going after the Second Amendment because you know you don't need it till they
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:31.760]  come after it. And again, that's a self-evident statement there.
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:37.480]  But I really think this is the beginning of the end because they know the Second Amendment
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:41.440]  is a beachhead of the republic. It's what the country was founded on. And on that, the
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:45.040]  right to defend yourself, everything else is built on. And that's why they're trying
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:51.280]  to kill it and knocking TV shows off Discovery and trying to have a purge and saying it's
[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:57.680]  like porn or we've gotta brainwash people is because the system knows that.
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:02.120]  That's why 99% of cops in major polls are pro-gun. The Secret Service is pro-gun. Once
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:06.720]  you've used guns, once you've been around it, you understand it. And it's literally
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:11.800]  like a religion. We've just gotta take people out and teach them safety, teach them history,
[02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:15.800]  get them into guns, it's over. I see liberals everywhere buying guns the last four or five
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:16.800]  years.
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:20.240]  And I think this desperate offensive against the Second Amendment is the death throes of
[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:23.080]  these people. Final comments on that subject, Ted Nugent.
[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:28.960]  Bottom line, I think everybody with a conscience and an ounce of sense realize that unarmed
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:34.920]  and helpless is an irresponsible condition. And you should avoid it all at every opportunity
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:39.920]  with all the intellectual responsibility to never be unarmed and helpless.
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:46.800]  And when the worst condition of unarmed helplessness is when tyrants and dictators and slave drivers
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:53.560]  and tyrants force the citizens into unarmed helplessness because Barack Obama and Eric
[02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:59.880]  Holder and all the leftists, they have their dream. It's called Chicago. It's a gun-free
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:05.880]  zone. You have to have the same state-issued paperwork. You have to have it in Savannah,
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:12.560]  Cuba to own a gun or even buy BBs or pellets. You have to have a firearms owner's identification
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:19.560]  card in Illinois since 1972. And it gets more dangerous there all the time. There's slaughtering
[02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:23.480]  people left and right just while you and I've been on the air, Alex.
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:28.800]  So everybody out there, number one, be a member of the National Rifle Association. Give away
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:34.480]  membership to the National Rifle Association. Join your state firearms organization. Let
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:39.440]  your elected officials know that you know that the right to keep and bear arms shall
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:43.280]  not be infringed is what they took a vow to support.
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:47.080]  Absolutely. And if they don't like it, get out of America. Ted Nugent. This has been
[02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:50.760]  our best interview ever. TedNugent.com. Look forward to having you back again as soon as

[02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:10.160]  freedoms are taken away? What can you not live without? What is your greatest dependency?
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:15.640]  Is it your guns? Is it your home? No, it's food. It all boils down to the food supply.
[02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:20.380]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply. Don't be dependent. Be
[02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:24.840]  self-sufficient. Don't wait for the government to feed you. Feed yourself. I can warn you

[02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:08.400]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:18.480]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show. Well, I've been interviewed by and had a lot
[02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:24.360]  of really amazing people on last week from Ted Nugent to Michael Savage to Howard Stern
[02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:29.680]  of all people. I was on his show. We're certainly breaking out, reaching new audiences and that's
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:34.680]  what's important to wake people up to what's happening. And the reception across the board
[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:41.320]  is good because the establishment is getting so overtly crazy, not just Obama but the Republicans
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:46.000]  as well have been critical obviously of the one party monopoly that masquerades with its
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:47.980]  two heads.
[02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:52.960]  But Gerald Cilente of thetrendsjournal.com is again probably the most popular guest we
[02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:58.760]  have on. I know I always enjoy his wit and humor and also his piercing intellect into
[02:08:58.760 --> 02:09:03.800]  what he sees in trends developing. And we also over the years have broken down trends
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:07.920]  that we see developing, mainly from what MIT and DARPA and the globalists say they're gonna
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:08.920]  do.
[02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:12.360]  I don't have to even look into the future on things historically, they pretty much tell
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:16.840]  us what they're gonna try to do, but not everything turns out the way they want. It doesn't matter,
[02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:20.360]  they're in controls, they just regroup and move forward. The globalists according to
[02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:24.800]  Brzezinski and others and I concur about 10 years behind. So we are in the fight but it's
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:25.800]  very serious.
[02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:32.600]  Now I've got a host of subjects I wanna get into with Gerald Cilente here today concerning
[02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:37.400]  Bernanke, what's happening in Europe, the global meltdown, the fact that the bond market
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:42.500]  is this huge bubble, a new housing bubble. We're gonna get into all of these points with
[02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:50.480]  Gerald Cilente and some new nuances to major trends that he's been accurately predicting.
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:55.700]  But I wanted to just raise this clip first with Gerald and get his take on it when working
[02:09:55.700 --> 02:09:58.640]  in government, working as a consultant and things like that.
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:02.040]  He's talked about that some of the past because I've studied history, I've studied the modern
[02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:06.000]  elites, the white shoe boys as he calls them and the prostitutes that regurgitate things
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:12.440]  for them. But now I'm seeing levels of regurgitation that I've never seen. I mean, it's like two
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:17.040]  or three times worse where Gibbs gets up and says, yeah, I was told a lie and said there
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:20.400]  were no drones even though it was an admitted drone program.
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:24.120]  They now admit 2 billion bullets bought the last 14 months, that's official federal government
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:29.440]  press releases. They came out in Politico and Slate saying Sarah Palin, whether you
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:33.340]  love her or hate her, is insane and there are no bullets being bought. They just said
[02:10:33.340 --> 02:10:38.060]  his internet rumor gave no proof. I mean, that's a thing that's been an AP Reuters,
[02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:40.040]  you name it.
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:42.720]  And I'm seeing more and more of this where all over the country they're passing laws
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:48.700]  to forcibly inoculate kids and saying they don't need parental consent. I mean, they're
[02:10:48.700 --> 02:10:54.040]  moving at light speed here and they're delusional because they're actually losing the public
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:59.200]  because of this. And they think just because there's election fraud and they can keep reelecting
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:01.280]  their puppets that we're not seeing through it.
[02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:05.560]  I think we're getting to a Marie Antoinette French Revolution where they're about to beat
[02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:11.080]  down the palace gates and the people are starving. They're begging for food and thousands are
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:16.360]  dying a day in the city of Paris alone, your majesty. And she says, let them eat cake and
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:20.680]  went off to play with our French poodles and French bulldogs.
[02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:26.800]  And then they tore down the gates and killed everybody. So we're seeing these parallels
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:30.640]  going on here. So I wanted to play this clip and then go to Gerald and get his take on
[02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:35.280]  where he sees America going because the system is not going to back down. More and more we
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:36.280]  see that's clear.
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:40.560]  Let's go to this Robert Gibbs clip of where he makes a joke out of it, that he was lying
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:45.200]  to the public under orders, lying about something that it's like saying New York City doesn't
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:49.800]  exist. I mean, it's that bad. And what is the method to the madness? Here it is.
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:54.120]  When I went through the process of becoming press secretary, one of the first things they
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:59.200]  told me was you're not even to acknowledge the drone program. You're not even to discuss
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:04.900]  that it exists. And so I would get a question like that. And literally I couldn't tell you
[02:12:04.900 --> 02:12:09.160]  what major asked because once I figured out it was about the drone program, I realized
[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:14.960]  I'm not supposed to talk about it. But here's what's inherently crazy about that proposition.
[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:22.440]  You're being asked a question based on reporting of a program that exists. So you're the official
[02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:27.840]  government spokesperson acting as if the entire program, pay no attention to the man behind
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:28.840]  the curtain.
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:34.080]  Now see, don't look a little man behind the curtain. That's a Wizard of Oz illusion. And
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:39.660]  so we've gotten to this point now where on purpose, we're like, hey, you're confiscating
[02:12:39.660 --> 02:12:44.520]  guns in New York and arresting veterans for clips over 10 mags. Well, that's not tyranny.
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:48.480]  Or we don't want your guns as they introduce the bills federally to ban them. And we get
[02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:52.520]  the official memorandums from the Justice Department about their plan to register and
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:54.480]  then confiscate all guns.
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:59.120]  And that's not even a news item. It's the deception and the military tactic of saying
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:03.000]  this isn't an assault. It's like Mars attacks where the aliens are shooting people with
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:07.640]  ray guns with loudspeakers saying don't run, we are your friends. And people are stopping
[02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:12.840]  because they say that and the aliens are shooting them and then laughing. So this is a military
[02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:13.840]  tactic.
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:18.420]  Gerald Salente quantify this because for those of us that are half awake or informed, it's
[02:13:18.420 --> 02:13:25.200]  comical and it wasn't so serious. What is the master strategy here to induce us into
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:31.600]  mass Stockholm syndrome or learned helplessness or is the word normalcy bias? What is the
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:40.200]  tactic and am I right from your research that things are getting much worse very quickly?
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:45.440]  And the Cylon Raiders have attacked. Gerald Salente joining us via the miracle of Skype.
[02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:48.040]  Gerald, did you get that question, that long question?
[02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:55.680]  Yeah, we just lost your Skype. Okay, yeah, they've been having power outages and stuff
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:59.900]  because of the storms. And we're gonna work that out with Gerald Salente. But you heard
[02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:07.880]  my big question there to everyone about what we're facing as a society.
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:10.040]  We were worried about the interview with Gerald because he's been having intermittent power
[02:14:10.040 --> 02:14:15.380]  outages. And again, that was actually a transmission from Cylon. And then as the public proved
[02:14:15.380 --> 02:14:19.000]  there wasn't a transmission from Cylon, I would say no, no, the Cylons are real. And
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.080]  we're like, well, we have a memo where you admit the Cylons aren't real and that it's
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:23.080]  a movie.
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:28.520]  Cylons are real, you are a conspiracy theorist. So what do you do? I mean, we need to understand
[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:33.600]  this is a psychological tactic now, where they say we are not gonna put toll roads on
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:38.320]  I-35, and then they officially are. And you go to the meeting and they go, we are not
[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:43.100]  putting toll roads on I-35, we are putting them on I-35.
[02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:47.480]  But here you are a year ago swearing and it's law, you can't put it on 35 or MOPAC, and
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:53.120]  now you're saying you're doing it. Well, we are not doing it, but we are. And you're in
[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:56.660]  a public meeting going, here's the official printout, we're here, you're about to vote
[02:14:56.660 --> 02:14:59.480]  on this at the Campo board today.
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:03.740]  And they go, no, we're not. And so it's a new tactic where they've learned if they just
[02:15:03.740 --> 02:15:08.800]  act like, it's the equivalent of coming home and your wife is in bed with another man.
[02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:14.920]  And the sheets are off, it's 100% what's happening, and you catch them in the act. The windows
[02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:20.200]  are steamed up, the mirror in the bathroom is steamed up, you walk in, the wife is in
[02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:21.200]  bed with another man.
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:25.840]  You say, get off my wife, and they go, there is no wife, there is no man, there is no,
[02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:31.380]  you're an Easter Bunny. And you're like, I'm an Easter Bunny. I mean, what are they doing?
[02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:36.740]  What is happening? Okay, then that's my first question for Gerald, do we have him via phone?
[02:15:36.740 --> 02:15:44.580]  This is quite the build up, let me tell you. Ladies and gentlemen, this is exciting. Hey,
[02:15:44.580 --> 02:15:49.820]  Gerald's great on the phone, though we can't look at him, always sharply dressed. Okay,
[02:15:49.820 --> 02:15:51.620]  we have video and phone audio.
[02:15:51.620 --> 02:15:56.740]  Gerald, you heard my question about this tactic to boldly lie. Are they trying to train us
[02:15:56.740 --> 02:16:00.380]  that lies are okay? Gerald Cilente, trendsjournal.com.
[02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:06.900]  What it is Alex, it's fear and hysteria. They've been using it forever. And it's not only the
[02:16:06.900 --> 02:16:13.260]  Obama's press secretary. Go back to that whole situation under George Bush. You remember
[02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:20.060]  the guy that resigned and he refused to keep lying. And how about the Gulf of Tonkin? You
[02:16:20.060 --> 02:16:25.100]  could go back to that one. All right, Saddam Hussein didn't have weapons of mass destruction
[02:16:25.100 --> 02:16:31.300]  that ties to Al Qaeda. It's much bigger than that. I believe we have to go back to President
[02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:37.180]  Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces during World War II,
[02:16:37.180 --> 02:16:42.940]  a two term Republican president and a five star general who warned the people that the
[02:16:42.940 --> 02:16:49.100]  military industrial complex is taking over the nation. And it's a takeover. It's not
[02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:53.180]  only the military industrial complex taking us to war.
[02:16:53.180 --> 02:17:01.220]  They've already declared that we're in a state of war at home. And that gives them the license
[02:17:01.220 --> 02:17:06.300]  to surveil us all the time. I mean, you know what happened just a few days ago with the
[02:17:06.300 --> 02:17:13.680]  Supreme Court refusing to hear the case of warrantless wiretapping and watching us make
[02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:15.700]  every move that we make.
[02:17:15.700 --> 02:17:21.900]  So you can see it's a complete military takeover, just different divisions of it.
[02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:25.460]  That's right. You just pierced right to the core of it. And from my research, you're absolutely
[02:17:25.460 --> 02:17:30.500]  right, Gerald. You said it in one minute when I said it in five. That is it. Under the rules
[02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:35.180]  of war, you lie to people. And they've now declared war on us and treat us as the enemy
[02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:36.900]  and officially say that.
[02:17:36.900 --> 02:17:41.460]  And so we are treated as a foreign enemy. And this is the White Shoe Wall Street megabank
[02:17:41.460 --> 02:17:46.900]  occupation. That's exactly what it is. And when you look at all of the wars passed in
[02:17:46.900 --> 02:17:53.300]  modern history, the fundamentals behind the wars were economics. I've made this very clear
[02:17:53.300 --> 02:17:54.780]  over and over again.
[02:17:54.780 --> 02:18:01.300]  You don't even have to go back that far, Alex. You go back to the crash of 1929, the Great
[02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:09.820]  Depression, currency wars, trade wars, World War. You look at it now, the Panic of 08,
[02:18:09.820 --> 02:18:13.740]  currency wars, the Great Depression. We're in a depression. You know what they call over
[02:18:13.740 --> 02:18:21.500]  there in Italy and in Spain and in Greece and in Portugal with average unemployment
[02:18:21.500 --> 02:18:31.320]  around 20%, some places 27%, other places 15, 18%. They still call it a recession.
[02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:37.340]  Millions of people taking to the streets. It doesn't make the US news. They're not talking
[02:18:37.340 --> 02:18:45.140]  about it. In Spain this last weekend, millions of people took to the streets. Coming up tomorrow
[02:18:45.140 --> 02:18:52.080]  in Portugal, millions of people are slated to hit the streets again. It's a depression.
[02:18:52.080 --> 02:19:00.220]  And now you listen to the new prime minister of Japan. You listen to the former head of
[02:19:00.220 --> 02:19:10.140]  the Bundesbank, now chairman of UBS, Alex Verba. You listen to the head of the Bank
[02:19:10.140 --> 02:19:16.860]  of England, Mervyn King. We're in a currency war. Now they're talking about trade wars.
[02:19:16.860 --> 02:19:23.540]  Next is World War. When all else fails, they take you to war. And that's what we're heading
[02:19:23.540 --> 02:19:31.900]  toward. And I believe they know it because as we're seeing what we saw in Italy recently
[02:19:31.900 --> 02:19:37.380]  with the new party coming in and gaining all of that power, you saw the world equity markets
[02:19:37.380 --> 02:19:44.580]  go into panic. Why? Because they know that the people are no longer going to take it.
[02:19:44.580 --> 02:19:50.780]  So they are preparing for the worst. And the worst is when the people hit the streets.
[02:19:50.780 --> 02:19:55.820]  We're going to come back with that key information with Gerald Cilente and then get into the
[02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:59.980]  rest of the key info he's got to cover today. Stay tuned. Tell your friends and family tune

[02:23:55.100 --> 02:24:07.540]  All right, Gerald Cilente is our guest. I want to go right back where he left off as
[02:24:07.540 --> 02:24:13.460]  they gear up for the implosion, as the bond markets get spooked, as the bubble we're in
[02:24:13.460 --> 02:24:20.620]  in America frays at the edges. Gerald, what do you expect to see happen? Gerald Cilente?
[02:24:20.620 --> 02:24:25.820]  Yes, before I move on to that, I want to follow up on what you were talking about with Gibbs
[02:24:25.820 --> 02:24:32.540]  and the lies. I remember now it was Scott McClellan under Bush. And actually we did
[02:24:32.540 --> 02:24:38.820]  a whole piece in the Trends Journal about how he wrote a book and how they dismissed
[02:24:38.820 --> 02:24:44.440]  him and how the prostitutes tried to drive him into the ground. And we did a complete
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:53.660]  analysis of how all the prostitutes from ABC, CBS, CNN, the same names you hear today, knew
[02:24:53.660 --> 02:24:57.980]  it was a lie and were afraid to speak out.
[02:24:57.980 --> 02:25:03.740]  And here's something just from a couple of days ago from the toilet paper of record,
[02:25:03.740 --> 02:25:13.140]  the New York Times, about how they cooked the books on the progress, the so-called progress
[02:25:13.140 --> 02:25:17.700]  in Afghanistan. You saw that article that just came out?
[02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:21.780]  Absolutely. Yeah, Afghan signs of progress turned out
[02:25:21.780 --> 02:25:29.140]  to be error. Isn't that nice? Yeah, they forgot to carry a one, you know? So the whole thing
[02:25:29.140 --> 02:25:37.940]  is one big lie. Look what's going on as they're talking about sequestering, you know?
[02:25:37.940 --> 02:25:46.460]  What's that? It's fear and hysteria from the DC drama queens and the beltway circle jerks.
[02:25:46.460 --> 02:25:55.220]  This is all they do. It's one failure after another. And here's the nice news. Hey, all
[02:25:55.220 --> 02:26:01.260]  you folks that are losing your homes, can't find a good job. Hey, Detroit's turning to
[02:26:01.260 --> 02:26:10.740]  crap. Camden's just wonderful. Would you like to have a vacation in a beautiful run-down
[02:26:10.740 --> 02:26:11.740]  US city?
[02:26:11.740 --> 02:26:21.060]  Hey, they just sent more money to friends of Syria. Isn't that wonderful? Nice Islamists
[02:26:21.060 --> 02:26:27.880]  fronting for the US military. Friends of Syria. Hey, why don't they start a Friends of Alex
[02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:39.340]  Jones and Gerald Cilenti campaign instead of sending these criminals already $400 million.
[02:26:39.340 --> 02:26:45.880]  Now get back to work, everybody. Stop those shelves at Walmart. Put on a nice smile when
[02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:52.900]  you walk into Staples and say, have a nice day as you leave as they rob your money to
[02:26:52.900 --> 02:26:59.940]  give it to their friends. So when you look at the news and you see a tiny little story
[02:26:59.940 --> 02:27:08.380]  on how they lied during the so-called troop surge that that wonderful liberal Obama sent
[02:27:08.380 --> 02:27:11.580]  33,000 more troops to Afghanistan.
[02:27:11.580 --> 02:27:12.580]  Sure.
[02:27:12.580 --> 02:27:19.060]  Surge, it was a disaster. But they don't promote it as that. Oh, look for the white smoke coming
[02:27:19.060 --> 02:27:24.060]  out of the Vatican. That's what they're talking about today. Gerald, we're going to break.
[02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:27.280]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up. We're gonna get into the technicals and
[02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:32.580]  Bernanke and some of the points you wanted to get into when I asked you on the show.
[02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:37.300]  But before we do that, just specifically for listeners, I remember five years ago when
[02:27:37.300 --> 02:27:41.400]  Obama was first running. In the middle of the campaign, they bragged that Google and
[02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:47.280]  Twitter were working with him and giving him their databases to send out fake tweets and
[02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:51.420]  fake Facebooks. And I actually pulled the articles up. I remember last year USA Today
[02:27:51.420 --> 02:27:55.220]  did an article, Obama has millions of fake Twitter followers.
[02:27:55.220 --> 02:28:00.900]  It was admitted, 18 million of them. So all of this is going on. They brag about it, the
[02:28:00.900 --> 02:28:05.360]  Democratic Party, then a congressman who doesn't know what's going on, but he notices they're
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:11.140]  fake. He comes out and they deny it when they're bragging about it last year. So I wanted to
[02:28:11.140 --> 02:28:13.360]  show people this on TV.
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:18.020]  Republican rep claims Obama backers using fake Twitter accounts. Bush was doing this,
[02:28:18.020 --> 02:28:22.780]  but now it's expanded. They've got sock puppets, we've tracked it on infowars.com, that are
[02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:28.840]  fake anti-liberty people. It's on YouTube. That's all admitted, the Pentagon sock puppets.
[02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:33.680]  It's all admitted. But even congressmen who start to discover it, the media then lies
[02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:38.420]  and says they're lying. I mean, again, they deny things that are admitted.
[02:28:38.420 --> 02:28:45.540]  Well, again, of course they do. It's the whole corrupt system. Again, they take you to war
[02:28:45.540 --> 02:28:52.100]  for lies. They sacrifice our lives for lies. They steal our money for lies. And by the
[02:28:52.100 --> 02:28:56.780]  way, I wanna let you know, I go to your site every day and the information that you're
[02:28:56.780 --> 02:29:02.360]  putting out there in some of those videos, like the one I just watched yesterday with
[02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:09.680]  being stopped at checkpoints, what, 50, 30 miles away from borders.
[02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:13.260]  People should see this all the time. It's up to 100.
[02:29:13.260 --> 02:29:17.820]  It's 100 miles away now. Well, the one I hit was 77, but yeah, they go up to 100.
[02:29:17.820 --> 02:29:24.060]  Yeah, so the atrocities that are being committed against us, and the people don't wanna hear
[02:29:24.060 --> 02:29:26.540]  it. They're locked into their belief systems.
[02:29:26.540 --> 02:29:31.020]  Well, here's what I wanna ask you. We gotta go to break at trendsjournal.com, Gerald Cilente.

[02:32:00.780 --> 02:32:05.820]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[02:32:05.820 --> 02:32:10.460]  good sized meal that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact
[02:32:10.460 --> 02:32:14.700]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[02:32:14.700 --> 02:32:20.100]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[02:32:20.100 --> 02:32:25.180]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and
[02:32:25.180 --> 02:32:30.940]  be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered
[02:32:30.940 --> 02:32:35.980]  Younggeviti. The Younggeviti products are designed to give you the real nutrition you
[02:32:35.980 --> 02:32:40.300]  need. And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied. I've

[02:33:06.660 --> 02:33:27.060]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. We not only like to
[02:33:27.060 --> 02:33:30.580]  plug our new affiliates, and there's going to be a whole bunch of them we've got to mention
[02:33:30.580 --> 02:33:34.940]  next week, three or four new ones, several I didn't mention last week, so I guess five
[02:33:34.940 --> 02:33:38.500]  or six next week we'll be mentioning.
[02:33:38.500 --> 02:33:41.220]  Maybe even tomorrow, except I'm not doing the show tomorrow. It's Mike Adams, so that's
[02:33:41.220 --> 02:33:48.500]  why it's next week. Affiliates in Focus WASB 1590 AM in Rochester, New York's been carrying
[02:33:48.500 --> 02:33:56.380]  the show for almost 15 years. Probably our oldest affiliate next to WBCR outside Knoxville
[02:33:56.380 --> 02:34:02.760]  and the great Harry Groth John down there. So 14, 15 years WASB, because we had some
[02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:06.420]  affiliates that were even older, but those change formats or sell.
[02:34:06.420 --> 02:34:14.060]  These are our oldest affiliates, almost 15 years. WASB 1590 AM Rochester, New York, big
[02:34:14.060 --> 02:34:24.340]  thanks to Gail Reed and the staff at WASB. And then a newer affiliate, WRPW 92.9 FM in
[02:34:24.340 --> 02:34:29.140]  Bloomington, Illinois. The news and talk of Bloomington, check out events and contest
[02:34:29.140 --> 02:34:39.420]  at cities929.com, cities929.com. So very thankful, over 150 affiliates. And every week I'd like
[02:34:39.420 --> 02:34:44.340]  to thank a couple of the older affiliates and the newer ones, but also plug the new
[02:34:44.340 --> 02:34:45.340]  ones.
[02:34:45.340 --> 02:34:51.100]  So very, very exciting that all of that is happening. And what happens is stations end
[02:34:51.100 --> 02:34:56.540]  up picking up the Sunday show, which is live, and we did that on purpose so they'd have
[02:34:56.540 --> 02:35:02.780]  something to put their toe in the water, something to test us out. And then they end up putting
[02:35:02.780 --> 02:35:07.240]  us on at night, and then we get higher ratings on their daytime shows, they end up putting
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:08.240]  us on live.
[02:35:08.240 --> 02:35:13.780]  And it's pretty much the same thing has happened at every station we've been on, by the grace
[02:35:13.780 --> 02:35:17.460]  of God, very exciting, and thanks for putting up with me. So be sure and support those local

[02:36:01.980 --> 02:36:06.500]  at infowarshealth.com. Okay, I'm gonna try to really shut up and give Gerald Cilente
[02:36:06.500 --> 02:36:11.660]  the floor cuz he's got a lot to cover. And I really also enjoy watching the new TV news
[02:36:11.660 --> 02:36:16.700]  updates they're doing over at trendsjournal.com. They're just really adding a lot more over
[02:36:16.700 --> 02:36:19.040]  there via demand.
[02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:23.020]  People want more and we appreciate him giving us time here. So you heard my question before
[02:36:23.020 --> 02:36:28.140]  the break, no need to restate it other than for new listeners. We've seen this in history.
[02:36:28.140 --> 02:36:32.140]  We see the arrogance of the elite where they start smoking their own dope. I don't see
[02:36:32.140 --> 02:36:36.580]  this going well for civilization or the establishment. I don't think they're gonna get away with
[02:36:36.580 --> 02:36:40.020]  what they're doing, but they may bring down society in the process.
[02:36:40.020 --> 02:36:45.540]  So looking out into the future, the good scenarios, the bad scenarios, the ugly scenarios, let's
[02:36:45.540 --> 02:36:50.540]  start with the bad scenarios. What happens if this continues a year, two years, five
[02:36:50.540 --> 02:36:52.300]  years, where does it lead?
[02:36:52.300 --> 02:36:57.940]  Well again, let's look at the financial facts first. We just saw the dog and pony show put
[02:36:57.940 --> 02:37:05.340]  on by Osama Ben Bernanke, America's public enemy number one. And I say that the Federal
[02:37:05.340 --> 02:37:11.180]  Reserve Chairman, there's a couple of important things to remember about this.
[02:37:11.180 --> 02:37:16.140]  You know, Alex, it takes them five years as part of the whole scam to release the Fed
[02:37:16.140 --> 02:37:21.300]  minutes for we the people to read. Isn't that wonderful? We're too stupid to read them as
[02:37:21.300 --> 02:37:26.180]  they come out. They have to wait for five years. Of course, they do that purposefully
[02:37:26.180 --> 02:37:29.140]  so that we can't see how dumb they are.
[02:37:29.140 --> 02:37:35.820]  Because everybody can now see what morons they are when you see that as the crash was
[02:37:35.820 --> 02:37:41.860]  happening, the panic of 08 was underway. And as we were warning everyone that it was happening,
[02:37:41.860 --> 02:37:47.180]  the Federal Reserve from their minutes, none of them, none of them saw it coming and they
[02:37:47.180 --> 02:37:49.300]  kept denying the facts.
[02:37:49.300 --> 02:37:55.500]  So now we fast forward to now five years later, and there's Bernanke a few days ago at the
[02:37:55.500 --> 02:38:01.280]  congressional hearings. And what does he say? Well, first, what he said was that they're
[02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:06.840]  going to keep the stimulus going. They call it quantitative easing. Of course, that's
[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:11.820]  white shoe boy language for printing digital money not worth the paper it's not printed
[02:38:11.820 --> 02:38:18.340]  on. And this is historical. Nothing has ever happened like this in history, because it's
[02:38:18.340 --> 02:38:20.580]  not only the United States.
[02:38:20.580 --> 02:38:26.260]  As I mentioned, the new Bank of Japan guy, he's printing more money as well. You go over
[02:38:26.260 --> 02:38:31.420]  to Europe, they have a different name for it. That guy Mario Draghi, who's the head
[02:38:31.420 --> 02:38:37.580]  of the European Central Bank. Just a little background on him, of course, he was the former
[02:38:37.580 --> 02:38:43.100]  vice chairman of the European division of the Goldman Sachs gang.
[02:38:43.100 --> 02:38:49.500]  They call it long term refinancing operations. You can't remember that name? Try throwing
[02:38:49.500 --> 02:38:54.780]  out L throw and then try throwing this into it. You look at how they were supposed to
[02:38:54.780 --> 02:38:59.700]  pay back the money. Well, the numbers just came in a few days ago. Of course, it doesn't
[02:38:59.700 --> 02:39:05.200]  make the Prestitude Press. They're not paying it back. They don't have the dough.
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:10.660]  So now you're looking at, well, come up with another word. If five letters are too much,
[02:39:10.660 --> 02:39:17.220]  how about OMT? Ongoing monetary transactions. You like that one? We'll keep printing more
[02:39:17.220 --> 02:39:23.580]  money. So you look at China as well. They're doing it differently. And I have to admit
[02:39:23.580 --> 02:39:29.540]  much smarter because they're not only giving the money to the banks, what they're doing.
[02:39:29.540 --> 02:39:35.020]  This may upset a lot of people. They're building the infrastructure. Yeah, that's right. They
[02:39:35.020 --> 02:39:38.740]  have rail systems there that put hours to shame.
[02:39:38.740 --> 02:39:43.420]  They're taking all the fiat crud that's soon to be worth nothing and building a civilization
[02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:48.020]  with it. And the globalist can put policies here to shut us down while allowing them to
[02:39:48.020 --> 02:39:51.220]  develop because China, according to the CFR, is the future.
[02:39:51.220 --> 02:39:56.580]  Exactly, I mean, you look like that guy Bloomberg, the mayor in New York. He's going all around
[02:39:56.580 --> 02:40:03.840]  the country touting his gun control program. Hey Bloomberg, you ever go down into the subway?
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:11.040]  You want a day in Calcutta? Try riding the New York subways. It's a disgrace. I travel
[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:17.100]  the world. There's no place as disgraceful as the subway system in America.
[02:40:17.100 --> 02:40:21.300]  That species being mugged, I've been in there, it's pretty scary.
[02:40:21.300 --> 02:40:29.240]  Yeah, get thrown onto the tracks, have a nice day. So as we're looking at it, now Bernanke
[02:40:29.240 --> 02:40:37.180]  is coming out and saying, here's the warning signal. Interest rates may go up. He says
[02:40:37.180 --> 02:40:43.620]  it's going to be showing a sign of economic vitality. You know what that is, that's BS.
[02:40:43.620 --> 02:40:50.420]  Because look at the numbers that just came out today. Yeah, hey, GDP for the first, the
[02:40:50.420 --> 02:41:01.980]  last quarter of 2012, it didn't decline 0.1%. It grew 0.1%. Oh, wonderful, wonderful growth.
[02:41:01.980 --> 02:41:06.720]  So what they're saying, there is no vitality. I'm pointing this out, Alex, so that people
[02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:11.320]  can be prepared for what's going to happen. At some point, they're going to have to raise
[02:41:11.320 --> 02:41:17.980]  interest rates. You can't keep this going. This is unprecedented. As I said, it's worldwide.
[02:41:17.980 --> 02:41:22.100]  All they're doing is shoveling money in to keep the Ponzi scheme going.
[02:41:22.100 --> 02:41:27.740]  Oh, and just to show that it's not going, another little story that just came out, that
[02:41:27.740 --> 02:41:34.780]  $83 billion in profits that the big banks reported last year, they weren't profits at
[02:41:34.780 --> 02:41:42.260]  all. It's because we the taxpayers subsidizing them to get cheap money. So now, going back
[02:41:42.260 --> 02:41:49.480]  to the interest rates, why is the housing market pumped up again? Because you could
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:50.480]  borrow money.
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:55.660]  I just bought properties over here, as you know. I'm buying historical properties in
[02:41:55.660 --> 02:42:01.940]  colonial Kingston. I bought a 1750s house, a 1774.
[02:42:01.940 --> 02:42:06.080]  You're betting on America. Your idea is don't leave the country. You're betting on America.
[02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:07.080]  You're all in.
[02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:15.980]  Yeah, exactly. But the last one I just got a loan for, it's a residential from 17, I
[02:42:15.980 --> 02:42:26.540]  think 68, for 2.87%. And it's locked in for 15 years. But you're paying these back with
[02:42:26.540 --> 02:42:33.500]  cheap money. But now interest rates are going to have to go up. That's going to stop the
[02:42:33.500 --> 02:42:40.140]  real estate from, it will go back into a steep decline. Now, number two, they're also pointing
[02:42:40.140 --> 02:42:48.860]  to auto sales. Oh, brilliant. I got a deal for you, pal. How about 0% for 60 months?
[02:42:48.860 --> 02:42:54.780]  It's just another scam of like they did in the mortgage market. But now they're doing
[02:42:54.780 --> 02:43:02.340]  it in the auto market. So everything they're doing is they're creating another bubble.
[02:43:02.340 --> 02:43:09.060]  It cannot continue. When we're talking about the sequestering baloney and fiscal cliffs,
[02:43:09.060 --> 02:43:18.420]  this is chump change. They're never going to pay off $16.5 trillion in debt, plus, plus,
[02:43:18.420 --> 02:43:22.020]  plus, plus when you put the pensions and other things into it.
[02:43:22.020 --> 02:43:28.660]  So what does this mean? They're going to devalue the currency. They did the same thing during
[02:43:28.660 --> 02:43:34.140]  the Great Depression. And when I talk, by the way, and I'll get back to the Great Depression
[02:43:34.140 --> 02:43:39.780]  and how they devalued the dollar. But when I talk about currency wars and world wars,
[02:43:39.780 --> 02:43:45.900]  do you know, Alex, that as the trade wars started heating up and the countries try to
[02:43:45.900 --> 02:43:54.260]  sell more of their crap, Japan took themselves off the gold standard and lowered the value
[02:43:54.260 --> 02:44:03.220]  of the yen to 60% below the US dollar and 40% below the pound sterling.
[02:44:03.220 --> 02:44:09.780]  That allowed them to export more products, hence the trade wars and world wars. The United
[02:44:09.780 --> 02:44:15.460]  States tried to do the same thing, but they weren't as successful at it. We were on the
[02:44:15.460 --> 02:44:21.300]  gold standard back then, as you well know and the listeners do, too. They made us return
[02:44:21.300 --> 02:44:25.300]  our gold to the Federal Reserve.
[02:44:25.300 --> 02:44:32.660]  They took our money and then they devalued, it was $22, I believe, in 60 cents an ounce
[02:44:32.660 --> 02:44:38.820]  or something like that. When we turned it all in, they repaid the price of gold at $35
[02:44:38.820 --> 02:44:45.460]  an ounce, which meant that you lost 70% of your purchasing power. That's what they're
[02:44:45.460 --> 02:44:50.060]  going to do. They're going to devalue our currency.
[02:44:50.060 --> 02:44:59.020]  Why aren't gold prices going higher? They're only about, as we speak now, about what, 1580.
[02:44:59.020 --> 02:45:05.780]  The reason, I believe, is that they're rigging the market. A conspiracy theory? No.
[02:45:05.780 --> 02:45:14.540]  No, look at LIBOR. You got it. You got it. Look at LIBOR. How many hundreds of trillions
[02:45:14.540 --> 02:45:23.180]  of dollars worth of interest rates were rigged? This is not a conspiracy theory. It's fact.
[02:45:23.180 --> 02:45:29.220]  It's hard fact. So if they're rigging that, of course, they're rigging gold because-
[02:45:29.220 --> 02:45:33.380]  Well, they've been caught doing it before. I mean, and they've got fake tungsten gold.
[02:45:33.380 --> 02:45:37.260]  And the proof is, as you've said, Germany and all these other countries like Venezuela,
[02:45:37.260 --> 02:45:41.700]  they want their gold back. And the Federal Reserve's like, we'll give it to you in installments
[02:45:41.700 --> 02:45:43.300]  over the next decade.
[02:45:43.300 --> 02:45:50.740]  Yeah, right. They wouldn't bring it over by carrier pigeon. It's going to take the 2020.
[02:45:50.740 --> 02:45:59.140]  Gold's not there. And they know that by debasing the currencies and people going into gold,
[02:45:59.140 --> 02:46:07.780]  it will bring down the Ponzi scheme. So that's why they're debasing. Gold markets are very
[02:46:07.780 --> 02:46:15.700]  thinly traded. It's very easy to be manipulating them as well as silver. So for me, again,
[02:46:15.700 --> 02:46:22.980]  I do not give financial advice only for myself. I continue to buy gold. I continue to buy
[02:46:22.980 --> 02:46:27.580]  silver because I believe it's a Ponzi scheme.
[02:46:27.580 --> 02:46:32.420]  And even though other investments aren't perfect, anything's going to be better than a devalued
[02:46:32.420 --> 02:46:37.940]  dollar. So if you've got surplus funds, real estate, gold, silver, but you've got to study
[02:46:37.940 --> 02:46:40.700]  the real estate or you can get your butt handed to you.
[02:46:40.700 --> 02:46:45.660]  Again, I'm only buying historic buildings on the most historic corner in the United
[02:46:45.660 --> 02:46:51.060]  States. The only place on each corner is a pre-revolutionary stone building.
[02:46:51.060 --> 02:46:52.060]  Now, I understand how long-
[02:46:52.060 --> 02:46:53.060]  Because I love this country.
[02:46:53.060 --> 02:46:57.280]  I understand how long until they raise the interest rates.
[02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:03.500]  It's hard to tell because it depends on the currency wars. We just saw Venezuela devalue
[02:47:03.500 --> 02:47:08.340]  their currency. And we're watching what's going on in Japan.
[02:47:08.340 --> 02:47:11.780]  And they never announce it beforehand. They just do it, boom.
[02:47:11.780 --> 02:47:17.020]  They do it. Not only that, look what the Swiss did. I used to call the money cockroaches
[02:47:17.020 --> 02:47:22.860]  of the world. And I used to invest in Swiss francs. But then they pegged it to the euro
[02:47:22.860 --> 02:47:28.380]  because the franc was becoming so expensive, their companies couldn't export product.
[02:47:28.380 --> 02:47:32.860]  So yeah, they're going to do it like that. But I believe the flash point is going to
[02:47:32.860 --> 02:47:41.660]  be terror or war, fake flag or real.
[02:47:41.660 --> 02:47:48.300]  I agree with you. And now the attorney general who ran Fast and Furious is back in the news,
[02:47:48.300 --> 02:47:54.300]  suddenly saying that the anti-government people, you and I, Ron Paul, that we're the new terror
[02:47:54.300 --> 02:47:59.100]  threat. I mean, how obvious, the whole homeland security grid. Now, now Al Qaeda is our buddy
[02:47:59.100 --> 02:48:01.420]  over there fighting Assad.
[02:48:01.420 --> 02:48:07.140]  The globalists say we're the terrorist. I mean, this is just textbook central government
[02:48:07.140 --> 02:48:09.360]  takeover by a bunch of crooks.
[02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:16.280]  It is. I want to go back to that Gibbs point. My staff got me the Trends Journal. It was
[02:48:16.280 --> 02:48:25.020]  the one with that wonderful Anthony Frieda, screw the people piece here. There was a sense
[02:48:25.020 --> 02:48:32.380]  of pressure. There was a sense of pressure from the corporations who own where we work
[02:48:32.380 --> 02:48:37.880]  and from government itself to really squash any dissent.
[02:48:37.880 --> 02:48:47.180]  This is about the Iraq War, said Katie Couric, quote, I could remember getting in trouble
[02:48:47.180 --> 02:48:55.980]  with administration officials because of asking questions they didn't feel comfortable with.
[02:48:55.980 --> 02:48:58.700]  Sound familiar? Here we go.
[02:48:58.700 --> 02:49:02.800]  Sounds like Bob Woodward. And here's the thing, they later tattle about it like it makes it
[02:49:02.800 --> 02:49:05.020]  okay that they lied to us.
[02:49:05.020 --> 02:49:11.300]  What kind of courage? Imagine dying and knowing you were a person like this with no courage,
[02:49:11.300 --> 02:49:20.060]  dignity or self-respect, it gets better. There was a drumbeat of support from the administration
[02:49:20.060 --> 02:49:29.380]  and it is not our job to debate them. Coward, that prostitute-
[02:49:29.380 --> 02:49:35.380]  Did you hear that? It's not our job to debate the government. We regurgitate whatever they
[02:49:35.380 --> 02:49:36.980]  vomit on us.
[02:49:36.980 --> 02:49:44.380]  That's right. That was from Charlie Gibson, ABC. And we go on to write, whistleblower
[02:49:44.380 --> 02:49:51.180]  McClellan accused the White House, this is the wars that they sold us. They cost us a
[02:49:51.180 --> 02:49:59.420]  trillion dollars that wounded hundreds of thousands of our friends and neighbors and
[02:49:59.420 --> 02:50:01.940]  relatives, fighting a useless war.
[02:50:01.940 --> 02:50:10.200]  Killed 5,000 and about a million Iraqis. Yeah, here, whistleblower McClellan accused the
[02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:18.660]  White House, quote, of spreading distortions, shading the truth, speaking half-truths, and
[02:50:18.660 --> 02:50:26.860]  telling, quote, outright lies in a, quote, political propaganda campaign to sell the
[02:50:26.860 --> 02:50:30.700]  war to the American people, end quote.
[02:50:30.700 --> 02:50:37.300]  Where are the war tribunals? How come these people that took us to war are not being brought
[02:50:37.300 --> 02:50:38.300]  up on war crimes?
[02:50:38.300 --> 02:50:42.060]  And what's amazing, it then gives a green light to the next tyrant Obama to do whatever
[02:50:42.060 --> 02:50:47.500]  he wants. And then he gets away with it all, Benghazi, all these other energy scams, the
[02:50:47.500 --> 02:50:52.420]  stuff that's happened with Fast and Furious. I mean, it is just, the green light's been
[02:50:52.420 --> 02:50:57.660]  given. So what's coming next? How do we fight back against it? Bradley Manning has now pled
[02:50:57.660 --> 02:50:59.780]  guilty, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:59.780 --> 02:51:05.820]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates. Do you know the number one most valuable item in
[02:51:05.820 --> 02:51:11.420]  a crisis? Some people think the answer is gold. Others think it's a gun, but the correct
[02:51:11.420 --> 02:51:18.180]  answer will shock you. I just created a free video at crisis123.com that reveals a surprising
[02:51:18.180 --> 02:51:24.260]  item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis. 97% of Americans don't have this one
[02:51:24.260 --> 02:51:28.820]  critical item. In fact, they haven't even given it a thought. And the sad truth is that
[02:51:28.820 --> 02:51:34.020]  you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside
[02:51:34.020 --> 02:51:37.740]  your door. But I have to tell you, it could literally make the difference between life
[02:51:37.740 --> 02:51:43.900]  and death for you and your family. Watch my video at crisis123.com to discover the number
[02:51:43.900 --> 02:51:49.220]  one most valuable item in a crisis. You'll be shocked. See the controversial video that
[02:51:49.220 --> 02:51:53.260]  thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months. Go watch my
[02:51:53.260 --> 02:52:00.260]  video now at crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down. Again, that's crisis123.com.
[02:52:00.260 --> 02:52:06.700]  Hey everybody, Ty Bollinger here. Once again, real life, real stories. And he discovered
[02:52:06.700 --> 02:52:11.380]  Carnivora was so thrilled with the product that he shared it with his family and his
[02:52:11.380 --> 02:52:15.540]  friends and his patients. My dad was a family physician, he was a medical doctor. Almost
[02:52:15.540 --> 02:52:20.660]  all the symptoms were either diminished or gone. Amazing product, amazing results. Like
[02:52:20.660 --> 02:52:27.020]  an amazing thing having such a profound change how I feel and knowing that it was the Carnivora
[02:52:27.020 --> 02:52:33.260]  that did it. And a lot of patients got better, ranging from immune dysfunction to allergies
[02:52:33.260 --> 02:52:37.780]  and infection. Here's the toll free telephone number to call to access the Carnivora telecast

[02:54:02.180 --> 02:54:24.020]  Yeah, Bradley Manning is pled guilty to misusing classified data in WikiLeaks. But what about
[02:54:24.020 --> 02:54:28.180]  journalists they arrest who report crimes or government people like that CIA guy that
[02:54:28.180 --> 02:54:33.580]  exposed illegal torture? He's spending 30 months in jail for doing his job. I mean,
[02:54:33.580 --> 02:54:38.660]  shame on the FBI, shame on the federal government, shame on those juries, what they've turned
[02:54:38.660 --> 02:54:39.660]  into.
[02:54:39.660 --> 02:54:44.200]  I mean, this is so dangerous. And you've got a government using fake Twitter and Facebook
[02:54:44.200 --> 02:54:48.900]  accounts and they get caught. And then they just deny it and the media goes along with
[02:54:48.900 --> 02:54:53.300]  it. By the way, if you want the best gravity fed stainless steel filters, side by side

[02:55:17.460 --> 02:55:23.620]  in this country. Gerald, we only got four or five minutes left. Other key points you're
[02:55:23.620 --> 02:55:28.020]  gonna wish you covered once we're gone, once this show's over today, am I right in saying
[02:55:28.020 --> 02:55:31.900]  the craziness is intensifying and I think there's a breaking point?
[02:55:31.900 --> 02:55:37.180]  Or are the psych warfare chiefs just breaking the will with a normalcy bias where people
[02:55:37.180 --> 02:55:39.380]  just expect anything?
[02:55:39.380 --> 02:55:43.660]  I think it's both of what you said. And I think there's a model for us all to follow
[02:55:43.660 --> 02:55:49.020]  that's really not making it very much in the American media. And that's what just happened
[02:55:49.020 --> 02:55:50.020]  in Italy.
[02:55:50.020 --> 02:55:51.020]  Yeah.
[02:55:51.020 --> 02:55:54.180]  Something that we've been following for quite some time, predicted it in the Trends Journal.
[02:55:54.180 --> 02:55:57.060]  You did, only country to say no to the banks first.
[02:55:57.060 --> 02:56:02.100]  Yep, and that's the Beppi Grillo's five star movement. They call him a comedian, he's not
[02:56:02.100 --> 02:56:07.100]  a comedian, he's a brilliant satirist. You wanna see a comedian, how about those buffoons
[02:56:07.100 --> 02:56:09.940]  out there on the presidential reality show?
[02:56:09.940 --> 02:56:16.140]  Yeah, so the only big country in Europe is Italy so far. The bankers, Bilderberger upset,
[02:56:16.140 --> 02:56:20.620]  the small country that did it was Iceland. That's the model, isn't it?
[02:56:20.620 --> 02:56:25.540]  Yes, and this is really what's interesting with Beppi Grillo's five star movement. He
[02:56:25.540 --> 02:56:33.500]  never appeared on one, he refused to go on any of the TV shows with the prostitutes.
[02:56:33.500 --> 02:56:40.260]  He is the model for the Internet candidate that we wrote about in the Trends Journal
[02:56:40.260 --> 02:56:46.580]  in December of 1999. He did it with, remember the Internet was new back then-
[02:56:46.580 --> 02:56:51.300]  You don't go on the big shows, so called big mainline shows anymore, most of them.
[02:56:51.300 --> 02:56:56.740]  Yeah, he wouldn't do any of it. He did it with Facebook, he did it with Twitter. He
[02:56:56.740 --> 02:57:05.460]  did it like you and like I'm doing it with our own TV broadcasts. He did it by making
[02:57:05.460 --> 02:57:11.740]  74 stops around the country where hundreds of thousands of people turned out to hear
[02:57:11.740 --> 02:57:12.740]  him.
[02:57:12.740 --> 02:57:19.380]  He did it by galvanizing the people that were intelligent enough not to believe in the corrupt
[02:57:19.380 --> 02:57:20.380]  two party system.
[02:57:20.380 --> 02:57:25.900]  He got up off his butt and went outside the system, built our own system, that's the answer.
[02:57:25.900 --> 02:57:32.180]  That's the answer. He refuses now, they can't form a government because he has so holding
[02:57:32.180 --> 02:57:41.900]  so many seats. He refuses to deal with either of the two corrupt parties. He wants to bring
[02:57:41.900 --> 02:57:45.900]  the Euro zone and the Euro up for referendum.
[02:57:45.900 --> 02:57:46.900]  Yes.
[02:57:46.900 --> 02:57:48.580]  Let the people vote.
[02:57:48.580 --> 02:57:52.100]  Kill the Euro which they brag was designed to implode countries and take them over by
[02:57:52.100 --> 02:57:53.100]  the banksters.
[02:57:53.100 --> 02:58:02.060]  Yes, so the model exists. It's the five star movement. The model exists in Iceland. The
[02:58:02.060 --> 02:58:10.460]  model exists in the heart, in the mind and the spirit of each individual that has the
[02:58:10.460 --> 02:58:14.020]  courage to look within themselves to find it.
[02:58:14.020 --> 02:58:18.940]  This isn't, there's nothing complicated about this. How could, did you see the pictures
[02:58:18.940 --> 02:58:26.500]  of Obama in front of that big propeller at the Virginia shipyard the other day? Who could
[02:58:26.500 --> 02:58:28.340]  believe this stuff?
[02:58:28.340 --> 02:58:33.700]  Incredible. Gerald Salente, trendsjournal.com. I'm Alex Jones with prisonplanet.tv and infowars.com.
[02:58:33.700 --> 02:58:37.620]  Don't forget tonight's news at seven o'clock. Thank you so much, Gerald.
[02:58:37.620 --> 02:58:38.620]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:58:38.620 --> 02:58:50.060]  I'm Gerald Salente.
