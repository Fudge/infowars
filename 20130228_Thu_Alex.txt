[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.802]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:11.383]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.383 --> 00:00:12.943]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.943 --> 00:00:17.125]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:25.549]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.549 --> 00:00:30.431]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:32.452]  My head is spinning right now.
[00:00:34.472 --> 00:01:00.093]  I am having a lot of trouble processing and dealing with the off-the-chart magnitude of craziness going on in this world, and reading the news day in, day out, in the morning, noon, and night, being aware of what's going on, and then not even being able to process it all at once is truly
[00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:11.248]  Truly mind-boggling on so many fronts.
[00:01:11.248 --> 00:01:30.374]  But I read a bill this morning, and Melissa Melton's doing an article about this, SB 63, here in Texas, and this is being passed all over the country, California was the first last year, to where the government can come and get your 10-year-old
[00:01:32.645 --> 00:01:48.613]  To consent to a vaccine, even if you say no, saying the child, and this is a UN revolution, where they say children can give consent to sex, they can give consent to drugs, they can give consent to vaccines, they can give consent to abortions.
[00:01:48.613 --> 00:01:55.237]  Now, you have statutory rape, you have contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
[00:01:56.502 --> 00:02:02.912]  You have all of this historically, and it's on the books, it's in common law, it's in the state laws, and you read this.
[00:02:04.804 --> 00:02:07.765]  This is just one of the outrages here in front of me.
[00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:24.733]  The government releasing 10,000 violent illegal aliens, the warrantless wiretapping, the draconian gun-grabbing laws, the 85 billion to foreign megabanks of our taxpayer money every month, the designed tyranny being brought in.
[00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:32.236]  You read this and it says the child may consent to the child's own immunization, and then it goes on
[00:02:34.144 --> 00:02:36.327]  To just say the child can do whatever they want.
[00:02:36.327 --> 00:02:44.319]  And it also pushes giving pregnant women tetanus shots, which they've always known causes miscarriages.
[00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.061]  And they also, in the legislation...
[00:02:48.163 --> 00:03:01.389]  Say that all child care workers or anyone around children, football coaches, YMCA workers, if you work around children, they're already doing this now, the hospitals are making anybody that works there take shots outside of law.
[00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:07.692]  Some states have passed laws, the first ones making you take shots, now it's anybody involved in child care.
[00:03:07.692 --> 00:03:12.635]  They're going to make the government and the globalists, on record with all their secret experiments against us,
[00:03:14.697 --> 00:03:18.423]  They're trying to set the precedent where you will put in your body what they say.
[00:03:18.423 --> 00:03:21.147]  I mean, it is incredible.
[00:03:21.147 --> 00:03:22.349]  It is so off the charts.
[00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.574]  So, I'm going to be covering this in the shower.
[00:03:27.014 --> 00:03:31.260]  I'm going to get into all the other big news first, and then we've got Ted Nugent.
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.125]  He called in Sunday, but he's on with us today.
[00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:39.811]  Ted Nugent, one of the most prominent leaders of the Second Amendment movement.
[00:03:39.811 --> 00:03:42.815]  You can disagree with some of his politics, but not on the Second Amendment.
[00:03:42.815 --> 00:03:44.297]  And he is definitely a target.
[00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.862]  of the system in many, many, many different ways.
[00:03:50.862 --> 00:03:53.964]  And the establishment is coming after Ted Nugent.
[00:03:53.964 --> 00:03:56.546]  And so we've got to hang together or hang separate.
[00:03:56.546 --> 00:04:01.068]  He's going to be joining us in the second hour and then talk about a power-packed show.
[00:04:01.068 --> 00:04:06.992]  Gerald Cilente joining us live from Kingston, New York in the third hour.
[00:04:06.992 --> 00:04:11.895]  It's a taped interview I did with Nugent because he can only do it in the afternoon after the show.
[00:04:13.277 --> 00:04:22.247]  Or you can do it live Friday, and I'm going to be working tomorrow part of the day, but Mike Adams is sitting in and doing a great job sitting in here.
[00:04:22.247 --> 00:04:26.132]  The Health Ranger's got a big show lined up for you.
[00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:31.939]  And so that is basically coming up today.
[00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:32.700]  Gerald Cilente.
[00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:39.413]  And Ted Nugent here on the broadcast today.
[00:04:39.413 --> 00:04:40.974]  We are live.
[00:04:40.974 --> 00:04:43.295]  It is Thursday, the last day of February 2013.
[00:04:43.295 --> 00:04:51.599]  We're already about to be into the third month of 2013, the Ides of March.
[00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.421]  Beware them!
[00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:57.723]  Alright, get ready to plunge into the full transmission on the other side.

[00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:09.567]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[00:07:09.567 --> 00:07:13.470]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[00:07:56.762 --> 00:07:58.923]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com
[00:08:04.282 --> 00:08:16.537]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:22.445]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:25.250]  Until 2 p.m.
[00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.253]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:27.253 --> 00:08:29.436]  We are here live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:29.436 --> 00:08:33.481]  Again, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:08:33.481 --> 00:08:35.584]  All right, where to start?
[00:08:35.584 --> 00:08:36.645]  Wow!
[00:08:36.645 --> 00:08:41.331]  We've got Gerald Cilente joining us live in the third hour today.
[00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:48.418]  We have Ted Nugent coming back on the broadcast after he called in listening to the Sunday show.
[00:08:48.418 --> 00:08:51.181]  I guess he was listening on 590 AM here locally.
[00:08:51.181 --> 00:08:53.863]  He lives north of Austin, Texas.
[00:08:53.863 --> 00:08:56.405]  Lived in Texas now for 10 years.
[00:08:56.405 --> 00:09:01.130]  This is a taped interview because he couldn't do it when I was live yesterday.
[00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.512]  So he did it taped.
[00:09:03.512 --> 00:09:09.038]  It's very, very powerful and it will premiere in the next hour.
[00:09:09.038 --> 00:09:15.324]  Paul Watson's going to be popping in about this report that's up at Infowars.com right now.
[00:09:16.803 --> 00:09:19.225]  That has gotten almost no attention.
[00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:22.267]  Tech guru warns of Internet disaster.
[00:09:22.267 --> 00:09:27.371]  Scientist Danny Hillis calls for Internet Plan B in times of emergency.
[00:09:27.371 --> 00:09:40.240]  And then Paul Watson links to articles that I and he wrote more than six, seven years ago with the Internet2 MIT DARPA consortium publicly meeting at conferences with the minutes of the meetings
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:10:03.144]  Saying there would be staged attacks on the web and a pretext to build a new government, global, homeland security system that government is on and select corporations, internet too, that they will then shut down the old web, forcing everyone on to the new web with the new systems where you have no basic liberties.
[00:10:04.355 --> 00:10:16.278]  So it's like either taking an existing road over and making it a toll road, or building some other lanes next to a road, and then not repairing the other road, and then finally shutting the old road down.
[00:10:16.278 --> 00:10:26.381]  Instead of letting the old road build, they bring in cyber security to choke the old road, to shut it down, to potmark it, to put surveillance grids in it.
[00:10:28.393 --> 00:10:34.776]  And they cite Stuxnet is why they have to take the web over when the Pentagon with Israel launched Stuxnet a year and a half ago.
[00:10:34.776 --> 00:10:43.479]  So there is all of that news as well that we are going to be breaking down here today.
[00:10:44.485 --> 00:10:46.307]  And I'm going to get Paul Watson to pop in.
[00:10:46.307 --> 00:10:50.892]  And Paul Watson is such a prolific writer and researcher of the incredible crew I've got.
[00:10:50.892 --> 00:10:52.193]  He is the best.
[00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:56.337]  And I just want to recognize him as our most valuable player in the fight for liberty.
[00:10:56.337 --> 00:10:59.661]  But still, he tends to underplay things.
[00:10:59.661 --> 00:11:02.423]  And I'm like, look, reality is sensational.
[00:11:02.423 --> 00:11:03.464]  Go with what it is.
[00:11:04.534 --> 00:11:05.834]  Because we're not tabloid.
[00:11:05.834 --> 00:11:08.395]  In fact, nine times out of ten, we underestimate.
[00:11:08.395 --> 00:11:09.656]  I mean, look at this headline.
[00:11:09.656 --> 00:11:11.556]  Tech guru warns of internet disaster.
[00:11:11.556 --> 00:11:16.718]  Scientist Annie Hill calls for Internet Plan B in times of emergency.
[00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:21.000]  The headline should be InfoWars.com prediction comes true.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.521]  Globalists plan to kill the old web to force you on the new web.
[00:11:25.384 --> 00:11:27.665]  And then we give all their quotes and all their background on this.
[00:11:27.665 --> 00:11:29.586]  I mean, they've been talking about this.
[00:11:29.586 --> 00:11:32.548]  I learned about Internet2 Takeover the first time they met in 2000.
[00:11:32.548 --> 00:11:36.309]  Then a few years later, they met in Austin.
[00:11:36.309 --> 00:11:39.691]  And I actually went to the conference.
[00:11:39.691 --> 00:11:44.994]  Okay, and I mean, off record, they're like, of course, we're going to shut down the old web and bring in a corporate one.
[00:11:44.994 --> 00:11:46.895]  It's gonna be like a glorified cable box.
[00:11:47.878 --> 00:11:59.200]  Where you're only gonna have big platforms like Yahoo, like Google, and then you'll have a subdomain on it, but you'll have no rights, and everything's surveilled on it.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.221]  Again, people keep asking, Alex, how do you keep knowing what's gonna happen?
[00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:05.301]  How do you keep predicting all this?
[00:12:05.301 --> 00:12:08.802]  Are you CIA?
[00:12:08.802 --> 00:12:11.523]  How do you know?
[00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:12.803]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:12:14.661 --> 00:12:18.704]  I read their white papers and their own publications.
[00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:26.250]  The globalists operate like you don't exist and like you're a dumb animal.
[00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.892]  They operate like you are the stupidest person on the planet.
[00:12:29.892 --> 00:12:41.621]  And listen, I'm frustrated because I've been around people in business that don't know about politics or geopolitical systems or history of the world who do know about everything else and who are really smart.
[00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:41.961]  Okay?
[00:12:43.715 --> 00:12:53.385]  I'm always amazed at how smart people are about general things, but then there's like a blank spot when it comes to larger systems in history.
[00:12:53.385 --> 00:13:01.093]  And it's because they are nice people, they cannot imagine that things are actually this horrible.
[00:13:01.093 --> 00:13:04.637]  And if you study criminology, that's why women get in the car.
[00:13:06.434 --> 00:13:09.176]  With the serial killer, because he's wearing a suit.
[00:13:09.176 --> 00:13:12.958]  Serial killers know to go out and wear a suit, have clean cut hair, drive a nice car.
[00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.260]  Women will get in the car with you.
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:20.123]  In fact, the more evil you are, the quicker they'll get in the car, because they misjudge the confidence.
[00:13:20.123 --> 00:13:26.928]  In their biology, women at a subconscious level and a genetic level are looking for aggressive, powerful killers.
[00:13:26.928 --> 00:13:28.509]  But not of women.
[00:13:28.509 --> 00:13:32.192]  They're looking for predators that'll protect them and be a powerful warrior.
[00:13:33.012 --> 00:13:46.543]  The problem is the psychopath is a genetic anomaly that has a warrior-type battle system and high IQ and silver tongue, but is a predator that just wants to feed on the innocent.
[00:13:46.543 --> 00:13:53.048]  Not a predator that wants to defend their own family and be a predator against tyrants.
[00:13:53.048 --> 00:13:56.270]  They are a twisted warrior.
[00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.512]  But I'm now digressing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:58.512 --> 00:14:00.474]  Ted Nugent coming up, Gerald Cilente as well.
[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:02.841]  Now let's stop right there.
[00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:04.782]  No, it's not the Ted Nugent when he called in Sunday.
[00:14:04.782 --> 00:14:05.863]  It's a new Ted Nugent.
[00:14:05.863 --> 00:14:07.605]  Ted Nugent's coming back on.
[00:14:07.605 --> 00:14:08.525]  Big interview.
[00:14:08.525 --> 00:14:09.166]  Why do I know?
[00:14:09.166 --> 00:14:11.167]  I taped it.
[00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:12.488]  He couldn't come on during a live show.
[00:14:12.488 --> 00:14:13.990]  Again, it's a taped show.
[00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.131]  Great job the crew did.
[00:14:16.131 --> 00:14:21.055]  And that is coming up, but then I'm live with Gerald Cilente after that.
[00:14:21.055 --> 00:14:23.297]  I'll actually have a lunch hour, but I'm not really going to have a lunch hour.
[00:14:23.297 --> 00:14:26.620]  I'm going to be running around doing 15 different things during that hour.
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.681]  I'm having meetings and recording some key reports.
[00:14:31.101 --> 00:14:33.842]  Because reality rests for no man or woman.
[00:14:33.842 --> 00:14:44.446]  Now, speaking of thinking you're stupid, speaking of building this technocracy, admitting it's a technocracy, admitting that it's anti-human, admitting that it's nightmarish,
[00:14:45.731 --> 00:14:51.537]  They then separately sit there on the news and all the magazines going, none of it exists, none of it's happening.
[00:14:51.537 --> 00:15:03.449]  I mean, years after the illegal, unconstitutional, uh, Geneva Convention violating, international law violating, drones killing innocent people, collateral damage, all of it.
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.062]  Skynet being developed and tested.
[00:15:08.062 --> 00:15:09.763]  Gibbs, I played the clip a few days ago.
[00:15:09.763 --> 00:15:10.944]  Can you guys cue that back up?
[00:15:10.944 --> 00:15:11.484]  Thank you.
[00:15:11.484 --> 00:15:13.226]  It's only like 35 seconds long.
[00:15:13.226 --> 00:15:26.155]  Gibbs goes on MSNBC and says, which is basically White House run, and says, hey, you know, I was told to say this didn't exist, which was ridiculous because it publicly it existed for years.
[00:15:26.155 --> 00:15:29.237]  It's like saying Grand Central Station doesn't exist in New York.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:35.621]  It's like saying it's a conspiracy theory that the Dallas Cowboys had Tom Landry as their coach.
[00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:38.491]  Anybody knows that's not true.
[00:15:38.491 --> 00:15:41.173]  So the question is, why do they do that?
[00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:43.875]  To just get you used to being lied to.
[00:15:43.875 --> 00:15:49.579]  Learned helplessness, mass Stockholm Syndrome, normalcy bias.
[00:15:49.579 --> 00:15:58.565]  They're trying to get you used to troops on the streets, checkpoints, craziness, huge cancer rate increases, forcibly giving your kids shots in public schools.
[00:15:58.565 --> 00:16:00.046]  That's now about to happen in Texas.
[00:16:00.046 --> 00:16:00.767]  This is incredible.
[00:16:01.587 --> 00:16:02.909]  And around the rest of the country.
[00:16:02.909 --> 00:16:09.654]  And giving women shots that they know for 50 years give you miscarriages a very high percentage of the time.
[00:16:09.654 --> 00:16:15.580]  They're talking about making it the law to give pregnant women tetanus shots.
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.862]  When it's a death sentence for that baby.
[00:16:18.706 --> 00:16:23.948]  And they'll just, everybody's like, yeah, okay, so 20% of women that take it, 25% or so, have a miscarriage.
[00:16:23.948 --> 00:16:27.170]  And they're just gonna normalize, maybe even arresting the woman.
[00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:34.373]  You know, now when they give baby shots for 30-something years, and they have a convulsion and die in the hospital, they just cover it up and say they don't know what it is.
[00:16:34.373 --> 00:16:36.554]  Or if it happens in the car, they arrest you.
[00:16:36.554 --> 00:16:37.875]  And even the cops now know
[00:16:39.176 --> 00:16:41.357]  Oh, did you just come from the hospital getting shots?
[00:16:41.357 --> 00:16:42.797]  I'm still going to arrest you.
[00:16:42.797 --> 00:16:44.138]  It's all like a big joke.
[00:16:44.138 --> 00:16:48.019]  We didn't just kill your kid with sudden infant death syndrome.
[00:16:48.019 --> 00:16:51.980]  We're going to charge you with a felony when we just murdered your kid.
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:17:01.584]  I mean, SIDS didn't exist until they went up to over 20 shots.
[00:17:01.584 --> 00:17:02.484]  You say, well, listen, they don't give me 20.
[00:17:02.484 --> 00:17:03.464]  They give me more like 9 or 10.
[00:17:03.464 --> 00:17:04.785]  Well, a lot of them are triple shots.
[00:17:05.845 --> 00:17:10.935]  But they're putting up to 20 different things in your baby, and notice a lot of kids can fight it off when they're first born.
[00:17:10.935 --> 00:17:14.823]  They've got all mama's hormones in them, they're tough, everything.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:21.965]  They've been feeding off mama's placenta, but man, they come in six months later, boy, they get that shot, baby's dead.
[00:17:21.965 --> 00:17:23.926]  Baby goes home, blood on the brain.
[00:17:23.926 --> 00:17:26.748]  They do an autopsy, there's blood on the brain.
[00:17:26.748 --> 00:17:30.551]  Well, we know in the inserts, it does, this doesn't matter, let's put some handcuffs on you right now.
[00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:33.373]  We're gonna make you do hard time.
[00:17:33.373 --> 00:17:38.117]  And that judge knows full well, okay, another mother, we killed their kids, we killed their daughter or son.
[00:17:39.252 --> 00:17:41.413]  Line them up, get ready for prison.
[00:17:41.413 --> 00:17:45.934]  20 years in prison and the jury conviction, you're gone.
[00:17:45.934 --> 00:17:49.575]  Doing hard time!
[00:17:49.575 --> 00:17:51.435]  Yeah!
[00:17:51.435 --> 00:17:53.176]  And now we're going to give you tetanus shots.
[00:17:53.176 --> 00:17:54.836]  Got the bills right here.
[00:17:54.836 --> 00:17:56.157]  Texas, other states.
[00:17:56.157 --> 00:17:57.677]  They're already passing these in some states.
[00:17:57.677 --> 00:17:59.618]  They're going to give your kids shots without consent.
[00:17:59.618 --> 00:18:01.138]  I'm going to be covering this at the bottom of the hour.
[00:18:01.138 --> 00:18:03.819]  They're going to be doing it all.
[00:18:04.957 --> 00:18:14.106]  And they're going to make anybody who's in child care from little league coaches to people who work at the YMCA, everybody, you're going to take whatever list of shots they say.
[00:18:14.106 --> 00:18:16.468]  It's over 56 of them right now.
[00:18:16.468 --> 00:18:18.870]  And you're going to get cancer and you're going to die.
[00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.672]  And you're going to thank the government.
[00:18:20.672 --> 00:18:24.916]  And you're going to cower when the police in black uniforms come and give you the shots forcibly.
[00:18:25.917 --> 00:18:27.418]  Oh yes, you're gonna love it.
[00:18:27.418 --> 00:18:29.560]  And the cops are gonna take all the shots and die too.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.463]  And they're gonna watch babies die and love it!
[00:18:33.463 --> 00:18:35.244]  Because they're good guys!
[00:18:35.244 --> 00:18:37.546]  The government's good!
[00:18:37.546 --> 00:18:39.327]  And I'm wrong to not think they're good.
[00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:40.468]  Let's play Gibbs.
[00:18:40.468 --> 00:18:42.730]  Here's Gibbs laughing about Wizard of Oz.
[00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:43.711]  I'm lying to you.
[00:18:43.711 --> 00:18:44.691]  Ha ha ha!
[00:18:44.691 --> 00:18:45.212]  Here it is.
[00:18:45.712 --> 00:18:53.795]  When I went through the process of becoming press secretary, one of the first things they told me was, you're not even to acknowledge the drone program.
[00:18:53.795 --> 00:18:57.057]  You're not even to discuss that it exists.
[00:18:57.057 --> 00:19:07.261]  And so I would get a question like that, and literally I couldn't tell you what major ass, because once I figured out it was about the drone program, I realized I'm not supposed to talk about it.
[00:19:07.261 --> 00:19:10.042]  But here's what's inherently crazy about that proposition.
[00:19:10.842 --> 00:19:16.808]  You're being asked a question based on reporting of a program that exists.
[00:19:16.808 --> 00:19:17.188]  Right?
[00:19:17.188 --> 00:19:24.675]  So you're the official government spokesperson acting as if the entire program... Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
[00:19:24.675 --> 00:19:27.498]  And there is a public program in every government.
[00:19:28.158 --> 00:19:38.085]  In ecoscience, I just gave you sources where they weaponize vaccines to soft kill you, where it kills you six months, two years, you know, down the road, or gives you degenerative disorders.
[00:19:38.085 --> 00:19:39.406]  I mean, they're all off the charts.
[00:19:39.406 --> 00:19:40.627]  They're killing us.
[00:19:40.627 --> 00:19:41.427]  It's a fact.
[00:19:41.427 --> 00:19:44.029]  And now they're going to up the ante and kill us even faster.
[00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:45.850]  We're all being bug poisoned right now.
[00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:47.251]  And when we come back,
[00:19:48.151 --> 00:19:50.091]  They're now saying Sarah Palin's crazy.
[00:19:50.091 --> 00:19:51.672]  There's no two billion bullets.
[00:19:51.672 --> 00:19:55.172]  They say, yeah, there are bullets, but it discredits you that you're right.
[00:19:55.172 --> 00:19:57.533]  They say, oh, Jones is discredited, but there are the bullets.
[00:19:57.533 --> 00:19:59.213]  And you're like, well, where's your proof?
[00:19:59.213 --> 00:19:59.813]  Well, you're right.
[00:19:59.813 --> 00:20:00.493]  That's what makes you wrong.
[00:20:00.493 --> 00:20:02.394]  Introducing Pro-Wine.

[00:22:30.518 --> 00:22:35.060]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:40.882]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.

[00:24:09.258 --> 00:24:10.618]  Alex Jones here back live.
[00:24:10.618 --> 00:24:16.580]  The websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and streaming video at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:22.943]  We are the tip of the spear against the eugenics, soft kill, ambient murder operation going on.
[00:24:22.943 --> 00:24:30.685]  And you can just type in government programs, UN caught adding steroids, UN caught adding viruses, UN caught adding live polio.
[00:24:30.685 --> 00:24:35.007]  And it's all mainstream news over the last 50 years, just exterminating people everywhere.
[00:24:35.007 --> 00:24:36.127]  And now they're doing it to us here.
[00:24:37.102 --> 00:24:37.522]  Think about it.
[00:24:37.522 --> 00:24:43.945]  It's not enough to kill people's kids with your shots that their own studies and inserts say it does.
[00:24:43.945 --> 00:24:50.228]  You gotta take the parents to jail after you murder the kid or brain damage them.
[00:24:50.228 --> 00:24:51.368]  Good job!
[00:24:51.368 --> 00:24:53.189]  I salute you New World Order!
[00:24:55.253 --> 00:24:56.754]  Yeah.
[00:24:56.754 --> 00:24:59.035]  But hey, you know, you could argue the parents deserve it.
[00:24:59.035 --> 00:25:11.360]  This government's on record testing Kim bios on third world countries, black people, whites, Hispanics, doesn't matter, live syphilis injecting people, radiating little children in the 50s, 60s, and 70s.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.501]  They haven't declassified anything since then.
[00:25:13.501 --> 00:25:15.001]  It's much worse now.
[00:25:15.001 --> 00:25:20.884]  It's like, oh, a government that's been taught, you know, 4,300 plus foster kids, the Department of Energy.
[00:25:21.664 --> 00:25:26.426]  From the 40s through the 70s, taking foster kids and frying them.
[00:25:26.426 --> 00:25:33.948]  Some of the radiation tests, they did them from a little bit to a lot, would kill the kid, dying screaming in a matter of minutes.
[00:25:33.948 --> 00:25:40.270]  I mean, putting them in a radiation chamber, frying little kids, clawing at the walls as you fry and murder a child.
[00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:44.591]  As they cook like a microwave and they get a white film on their eyes.
[00:25:44.591 --> 00:25:46.131]  But everything's okay.
[00:25:46.131 --> 00:25:47.632]  The government's nice.
[00:25:47.632 --> 00:25:55.914]  They're gonna take care of me, drink my fluoride water, eat my aspartame, that on record's causing type 2 diabetes to explode.
[00:25:55.914 --> 00:25:57.754]  It's fun when your wife gets cancer.
[00:25:57.754 --> 00:25:59.475]  It's fun when your kids get cancer.
[00:25:59.475 --> 00:26:00.855]  It's fun when your neighbors get it.
[00:26:01.635 --> 00:26:02.856]  It's a fun thing.
[00:26:02.856 --> 00:26:04.897]  Let's just take it lying down.
[00:26:04.897 --> 00:26:06.398]  Let's not get upset.
[00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:07.639]  Let's not get angry.
[00:26:07.639 --> 00:26:08.900]  That's extreme.
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.821]  Murdering little kids isn't extreme.
[00:26:10.821 --> 00:26:13.202]  Me getting upset, it's extreme.
[00:26:13.202 --> 00:26:17.205]  Me getting freaked out by the legislation that Melissa Melton brought me this morning.
[00:26:18.154 --> 00:26:19.135]  And I went and looked it up.
[00:26:19.135 --> 00:26:22.017]  It's introduced in Texas for forced inoculations.
[00:26:22.017 --> 00:26:27.060]  Every child care worker, if you work at a Mr. Gaddy's and kids are around, you gotta take shots.
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.582]  If you work at the YMCA, you gotta take shots.
[00:26:29.582 --> 00:26:31.283]  I mean, just the end of everything.
[00:26:31.283 --> 00:26:32.964]  Total tyranny!
[00:26:32.964 --> 00:26:34.465]  The cops are in the uniforms!
[00:26:34.465 --> 00:26:35.026]  They're ready!
[00:26:35.026 --> 00:26:35.586]  They're coming!
[00:26:35.586 --> 00:26:36.087]  They love it!
[00:26:36.827 --> 00:26:38.828]  Child-sized targets to shoot!
[00:26:38.828 --> 00:26:39.909]  Old women targets!
[00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:40.749]  Checkpoints!
[00:26:40.749 --> 00:26:41.409]  They're tough!
[00:26:41.409 --> 00:26:42.050]  They're ready!
[00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:42.830]  Yeah!
[00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:43.770]  Yeah!
[00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:44.151]  Yeah!
[00:26:44.151 --> 00:26:44.851]  They win!
[00:26:44.851 --> 00:26:46.232]  They win every time!
[00:26:46.232 --> 00:26:47.672]  America's theirs!
[00:26:47.672 --> 00:26:49.153]  And they run Al-Qaeda publicly!
[00:26:49.153 --> 00:26:51.134]  That's all over the news, but I'm on talk shows!
[00:26:51.134 --> 00:26:55.016]  How dare you say 9-11's an inside job and our government did it!
[00:26:55.016 --> 00:26:56.817]  Our government doesn't exist!
[00:26:56.817 --> 00:26:59.878]  It's run by a bunch of psycho New World Order people!
[00:26:59.878 --> 00:27:01.339]  Of course they run Al-Qaeda!
[00:27:01.339 --> 00:27:02.440]  And now it's all over the news!
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.080]  It was the U.S.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:13.886]  security force over Benghazi that went and killed the stupid... I mean, and I say stupid, the ambassador is there giving weapons to Al-Qaeda.
[00:27:13.886 --> 00:27:15.447]  That was his job.
[00:27:15.447 --> 00:27:16.827]  And so they wanted him dead.
[00:27:16.827 --> 00:27:17.928]  That was a hit.
[00:27:17.928 --> 00:27:20.289]  That was a White House murder.
[00:27:20.289 --> 00:27:21.770]  It's the only way to look at it.
[00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:24.131]  You look at the evidence, that's what it is.
[00:27:24.131 --> 00:27:25.132]  That's what's going on.
[00:27:26.897 --> 00:27:28.740]  Of course they didn't get more security.
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:37.213]  It was the Benghazi security funded by the State Department and the CIA that came over there and killed the ambassador.
[00:27:37.213 --> 00:27:41.539]  They got rid of the bag man that gave them over 10,000 heat-seeking missiles.
[00:27:43.288 --> 00:27:54.053]  They murdered him, and they happened to fight back for eight hours, and it got embarrassing as CENTCOM sat there watching their own troops and people get killed, and were saying, why don't we give them aid?
[00:27:54.053 --> 00:28:00.315]  And the White House said, stand down, just like the USS Liberty in 1967.
[00:28:00.315 --> 00:28:05.177]  And then it's all, they said they didn't know, but they did, and they ordered a stand down for eight hours.
[00:28:05.177 --> 00:28:06.258]  Of course they did!
[00:28:06.258 --> 00:28:09.299]  Their people went to kill everybody in the compound!
[00:28:11.906 --> 00:28:18.788]  But you don't think they won't kill an ambassador to cover something up when they put cancer viruses in your vaccines?
[00:28:18.788 --> 00:28:34.614]  And when your kid has an autoimmune response and blood on the brain, we've had brain surgeons on about this, like Blaylock, the insert says it does it, and your child has a convulsion, they even take people's kids, their other kids that live, when the kid has a convulsion in the clinic!
[00:28:35.947 --> 00:28:39.049]  They'll call the police and go, did you just beat your child outside of here?
[00:28:39.049 --> 00:28:39.969]  Give them the shot.
[00:28:39.969 --> 00:28:41.690]  You're waiting while the other kids get shot.
[00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:44.732]  Junior falls down, starts flopping around, or the toddler falls down.
[00:28:44.732 --> 00:28:46.332]  You're going to jail!
[00:28:46.332 --> 00:28:47.793]  You're like, hey, did that shot do it?
[00:28:47.793 --> 00:28:50.835]  Shut up, handcuffs are on you right now.
[00:28:50.835 --> 00:28:52.035]  I'm such a good officer.
[00:28:52.035 --> 00:28:53.636]  Oh, the government's so good.
[00:28:53.636 --> 00:28:55.097]  Oh, yeah, they're so good.
[00:28:55.097 --> 00:28:55.998]  Oh, thank you, government.
[00:28:55.998 --> 00:28:56.818]  You're so loving.
[00:28:56.818 --> 00:28:57.458]  I love you so much.
[00:28:57.458 --> 00:28:58.259]  Oh, yeah.
[00:28:58.259 --> 00:28:59.960]  It's a sick freak world, man.
[00:29:00.973 --> 00:29:06.976]  And then there's AP, there's Washington Post, there's all of them going, Alex Jones is discredited.
[00:29:06.976 --> 00:29:09.096]  Sarah Palin is discredited.
[00:29:09.096 --> 00:29:10.777]  These people are kooks.
[00:29:10.777 --> 00:29:15.899]  They are caught lying about two billion bullets.
[00:29:15.899 --> 00:29:24.163]  And you read the article, got a new one, Politico, Feds Media Rebut Sarah Palin's Stockpiling Bullets Claim.
[00:29:24.163 --> 00:29:26.984]  And then it goes on to say, well, they are buying the bullets, but it's no big deal.
[00:29:29.284 --> 00:29:36.146]  And then never say the amount's two billion, and only talk about a few hundred thousand by one agency and say that's no big deal.
[00:29:36.146 --> 00:29:41.768]  I mean, this is written just like the Washington Post one, and the AP one, with total deception.
[00:29:41.768 --> 00:29:44.648]  Total deception to their readers, just abusing them.
[00:29:44.648 --> 00:29:46.269]  We bought a couple hundred thousand bullets!
[00:29:46.269 --> 00:29:47.509]  Sarah Palin is a kook!
[00:29:47.509 --> 00:29:48.630]  We always buy that!
[00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:49.710]  You bought two billion!
[00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:51.110]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.631]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.631 --> 00:29:56.312]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.916 --> 00:30:01.977]  I had tried everything.
[00:30:01.977 --> 00:30:07.479]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:30:07.479 --> 00:30:12.302]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:30:12.302 --> 00:30:18.665]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:30:19.165 --> 00:30:30.372]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:30:30.372 --> 00:30:34.855]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:30:34.855 --> 00:30:41.119]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:30:41.119 --> 00:30:42.240]  Now that's results.
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:55.164]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products, and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[00:31:30.102 --> 00:31:36.286]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.

[00:32:02.601 --> 00:32:04.422]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:06.742]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[00:32:06.742 --> 00:32:08.463]  What can you not live without?
[00:32:08.463 --> 00:32:10.183]  What is your greatest dependency?
[00:32:10.183 --> 00:32:11.164]  Is it your guns?
[00:32:11.164 --> 00:32:12.124]  Is it your home?
[00:32:12.124 --> 00:32:13.544]  No, it's food.
[00:32:13.544 --> 00:32:15.645]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[00:32:15.645 --> 00:32:19.146]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[00:32:19.146 --> 00:32:20.386]  Don't be dependent.
[00:32:20.386 --> 00:32:21.486]  Be self-sufficient.
[00:32:21.486 --> 00:32:23.127]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[00:32:23.127 --> 00:32:23.807]  Feed yourself.
[00:32:24.247 --> 00:32:26.469]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[00:32:26.469 --> 00:32:30.031]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoodsDirect.
[00:32:30.031 --> 00:32:32.773]  It's the best long-term storable food on the planet.

[00:32:53.609 --> 00:32:54.410]  We are on the march.
[00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:55.510]  The empire is on the run.
[00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:56.471]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:17.694]  Alright, Alex Jones here back live.
[00:33:17.694 --> 00:33:19.616]  InfoWars.com is the tip of the spear.
[00:33:19.616 --> 00:33:21.899]  Thank you for spreading the word about it out there.
[00:33:21.899 --> 00:33:23.862]  During the three minute break, this is what I was doing.
[00:33:26.457 --> 00:33:33.702]  I walked back to Melissa Melton's desk, who is working on this next report for Infowars.com.
[00:33:33.702 --> 00:33:38.705]  And, you know, we don't just see a report about, hey, they're going to make pregnant women take tetanus shots.
[00:33:38.705 --> 00:33:39.686]  We know the whole background.
[00:33:39.686 --> 00:33:48.572]  So she was pulling up mainstream articles from the last 15, 20 years that are online of where the UN officially calls the tetanus shot the birth control shot.
[00:33:48.572 --> 00:33:49.413]  It's official.
[00:33:50.461 --> 00:33:54.543]  That they tell women it's a tetanus shot and they add a female hormone.
[00:33:54.543 --> 00:33:55.203]  This is official.
[00:33:55.203 --> 00:33:56.404]  She's writing an article about it.
[00:33:56.404 --> 00:34:04.827]  It's not denied that then sterilizes you because it attacks the gland that releases the hormone that's needed at the start of the second trimester.
[00:34:04.827 --> 00:34:06.228]  So you're not really sterilized.
[00:34:06.228 --> 00:34:06.588]  You have
[00:34:07.128 --> 00:34:23.463]  You have miscarriage, after miscarriage, after miscarriage, after miscarriage, and the UN talks it up because in Africa and Latin America and poor areas, second trimester miscarriages and also the inflammation in the gland can kill the woman.
[00:34:23.463 --> 00:34:26.266]  So it's an added goody.
[00:34:26.266 --> 00:34:28.368]  An added goody.
[00:34:28.368 --> 00:34:30.550]  And so we are being assaulted.
[00:34:31.738 --> 00:34:33.298]  And they are aborting us as adults.
[00:34:33.298 --> 00:34:37.840]  They are killing you with the aspartame that they're now going to put in the milk and dairy without telling you.
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.761]  It's all official.
[00:34:40.761 --> 00:34:42.481]  It's in over 10,000 products right now.
[00:34:42.481 --> 00:34:44.962]  And it absolutely kills baby rhesus monkeys.
[00:34:44.962 --> 00:34:45.802]  They're murdering us!
[00:34:45.802 --> 00:34:47.163]  It's fun!
[00:34:47.163 --> 00:34:48.183]  It's a loving government.
[00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:51.920]  These are nice people, and I think we should do whatever they say.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:55.521]  You know, the Attorney General is in the news saying homegrown terrorists are the main threat now.
[00:34:55.521 --> 00:34:58.102]  No, it's white Al-Qaeda folks.
[00:34:58.102 --> 00:34:58.902]  They're everywhere.
[00:34:58.902 --> 00:35:00.323]  They think there's a new world order.
[00:35:00.323 --> 00:35:02.564]  They think the government wants to hurt us.
[00:35:02.564 --> 00:35:04.444]  Oh man, they're bad people!
[00:35:04.444 --> 00:35:09.706]  Just take your fluoride water and take this shot and everything's going to be okay, alright?
[00:35:12.387 --> 00:35:14.330]  We're good people, we promise.
[00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:17.894]  Hey, poor folks, did you like that payroll tax increase?
[00:35:17.894 --> 00:35:19.817]  Because I promised I wouldn't raise your taxes.
[00:35:19.817 --> 00:35:25.964]  Oh, they're so loving.
[00:35:25.964 --> 00:35:26.945]  Oh, they're so good.
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.047]  Oh, the Republicans are going to save us.
[00:35:30.047 --> 00:35:32.948]  They're all bought and paid for by the very same people at the top.
[00:35:32.948 --> 00:35:36.250]  But there are a lot of House members who are anti-New World Order.
[00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:42.014]  And so the Republican leadership is in the news today talking about how dreadful they are and how horrible they are.
[00:35:42.014 --> 00:35:47.297]  Why they're not for No Child Left Behind, a federalized education which they passed and paid off media to promote.
[00:35:47.297 --> 00:35:51.199]  Oh, and they're not for bigger government and homeland security takeovers.
[00:35:51.199 --> 00:35:53.841]  And oh my gosh, and they're not for the UN.
[00:35:53.841 --> 00:35:55.262]  Oh, what are we going to do?
[00:35:55.262 --> 00:35:56.123]  What are we going to do?
[00:35:56.123 --> 00:35:56.683]  It's horrible.
[00:35:58.055 --> 00:35:59.657]  I need to settle down.
[00:35:59.657 --> 00:36:10.408]  I was very calm today until I saw, which they say has a good chance of passing, just introduced last week.
[00:36:10.408 --> 00:36:11.809]  We've got SB number 63 and SB number 64.
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:19.343]  So your child will give consent to get an immunization.
[00:36:19.343 --> 00:36:23.767]  Your 10-year-old will give consent, and the parents can't say anything.
[00:36:23.767 --> 00:36:28.490]  Now again, this overturns even ancient Roman law, all British common law, European common law.
[00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:32.553]  You can't come to a 10-year-old and say, get in my truck, get in my van, I got candy!
[00:36:33.354 --> 00:36:37.937]  And then some pedophile have sex with them, and then say, well, the 10-year-old said it was okay.
[00:36:37.937 --> 00:36:39.958]  You're gonna go to prison for life.
[00:36:39.958 --> 00:36:44.842]  You can't give 10 or 11-year-olds beer, or 12-year-olds, or 14-year-olds.
[00:36:44.842 --> 00:36:48.304]  That's contributing to the delinquency of minors if you're not their parent.
[00:36:48.304 --> 00:36:49.685]  I mean, this is parental consent.
[00:36:49.685 --> 00:37:00.972]  You gotta get parental consent to go to the mall on a field trip, or to go to the zoo, or the planetarium, or the art museum, or the demo office, or to the factory.
[00:37:00.972 --> 00:37:02.914]  Remember all those field trips in public school?
[00:37:03.755 --> 00:37:10.982]  And now, ladies and gentlemen, you still have to have that, but the state is your mommy and your daddy.
[00:37:10.982 --> 00:37:17.929]  The federal court ruled they can give your children laptops that you paid for and watch them at home without them knowing.
[00:37:17.929 --> 00:37:18.550]  Oh, that's not 1984!
[00:37:20.506 --> 00:37:23.528]  You see, and so many people now are scared of this or they feel powerless.
[00:37:23.528 --> 00:37:25.029]  They're like, well, I'll just go along with it.
[00:37:25.029 --> 00:37:27.030]  Hey, listen, dummy.
[00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:28.891]  So many yuppies go, oh, well, there are too many people.
[00:37:28.891 --> 00:37:30.212]  Yeah.
[00:37:30.212 --> 00:37:34.274]  And like I said to Howard Stern the other day, I said, Howard, you're being hit by this too.
[00:37:34.274 --> 00:37:36.615]  You know, did you get a warning not to drink this stuff?
[00:37:36.615 --> 00:37:38.256]  Not to eat this stuff?
[00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:40.378]  And there's like, oh, yeah, I guess.
[00:37:40.378 --> 00:37:41.638]  Yeah.
[00:37:41.638 --> 00:37:41.798]  Yeah.
[00:37:41.798 --> 00:37:44.160]  You think anybody's safe with this stuff going on?
[00:37:45.826 --> 00:37:47.527]  And it's official!
[00:37:47.527 --> 00:37:50.148]  And then I've got where they're going to make the pregnant women.
[00:37:50.148 --> 00:38:10.599]  You know, I have a crew member, then we're going to Paul Watson, I have a crew member who had a child, premature, his wife did, right at two pounds, barely lived, and they've been trying for a month with this baby in the hospital to give it shots, and they say, you're not taking the kid, because the baby girl lived, thank God, and is doing good, by the grace of God, your prayers.
[00:38:10.599 --> 00:38:11.260]  Thank you for your prayers.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.301]  And they said, you're not leaving and we're going to take the child if you don't take shots.
[00:38:15.301 --> 00:38:18.682]  Now, he hadn't played the card of, hey, I work for Alex Jones.
[00:38:18.682 --> 00:38:20.362]  You know, hey, I've been recording you all this.
[00:38:20.362 --> 00:38:21.582]  We're going to see what they do.
[00:38:21.582 --> 00:38:23.103]  But there is no law.
[00:38:23.103 --> 00:38:27.283]  And of course, you don't give a preemie vaccines, period.
[00:38:27.283 --> 00:38:32.765]  But see, a lot of hospitals that's coming out now won't give a homeless person treatment when they have a heart attack.
[00:38:32.765 --> 00:38:33.685]  It's all quiet.
[00:38:33.685 --> 00:38:34.825]  Wink, wink, let them die.
[00:38:34.825 --> 00:38:35.865]  They're killing people everywhere.
[00:38:35.865 --> 00:38:37.566]  They're killing old people, you name it.
[00:38:37.566 --> 00:38:37.946]  And so
[00:38:39.011 --> 00:38:43.872]  Whether they know it or not, this attitude comes with, kill that baby.
[00:38:43.872 --> 00:38:50.873]  But it's the government and the hospitals, what's like, if they kill that baby, folks, they'll just send him to jail and his wife.
[00:38:50.873 --> 00:38:55.034]  The baby has the autoimmune response, blood on the brain, goes into convulsions.
[00:38:55.034 --> 00:38:59.455]  The cops are gonna slam his face in the ground and feel good while he's going to jail.
[00:38:59.455 --> 00:39:04.636]  And if he says, hey, the shots may have killed my baby, they won't admit they've done this.
[00:39:04.636 --> 00:39:06.237]  They'll go, shut up, scum!
[00:39:06.237 --> 00:39:07.257]  Keep your mouth shut!
[00:39:08.561 --> 00:39:12.723]  Because they can't admit they weren't from the people killing the baby.
[00:39:12.723 --> 00:39:16.105]  And I've had enough of them!
[00:39:16.105 --> 00:39:24.149]  And you people out there who've got egg on your face saying I screwed up blowing up at Piers Morgan, I wish I'd have blown up at him more.
[00:39:24.149 --> 00:39:26.050]  Because God is my witness.
[00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:32.414]  I should have said, listen you red coat trash, you've been sent here to disarm us and I know it and I see through you.
[00:39:32.414 --> 00:39:34.655]  I know, so stop playing games with me!
[00:39:34.655 --> 00:39:37.617]  I held back and I shouldn't have!
[00:39:38.581 --> 00:39:42.447]  But it's still got the sleeping giant to kind of halfway wake up out of its trance.
[00:39:42.447 --> 00:39:45.672]  Our forebears went through a lot less than this.
[00:39:45.672 --> 00:39:50.159]  And they were getting armed going around saying, it's time to fight back.
[00:39:50.159 --> 00:39:51.441]  It's time to kill people!
[00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:54.904]  And we're like, oh, Paul Revere, George Washington.
[00:39:54.904 --> 00:39:57.225]  I'm simply saying, don't let them give your kids shots.
[00:39:57.225 --> 00:39:58.386]  Here's the evidence.
[00:39:58.386 --> 00:39:59.186]  Please listen to me.
[00:39:59.186 --> 00:40:00.907]  It's like, that guy's extreme.
[00:40:00.907 --> 00:40:03.269]  That guy's, of course you bet I'm extreme, man.
[00:40:03.269 --> 00:40:05.670]  I got empathy that's deep.
[00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:07.971]  I'm not a mile wide and an inch deep, folks.
[00:40:07.971 --> 00:40:11.573]  I'm a mile wide and a million miles deep.
[00:40:11.573 --> 00:40:12.413]  And you are, too.
[00:40:12.413 --> 00:40:13.474]  You just don't know it.
[00:40:13.474 --> 00:40:14.654]  This gets to me.
[00:40:14.654 --> 00:40:18.516]  This freaks me out.
[00:40:18.516 --> 00:40:20.497]  This is normal.
[00:40:20.497 --> 00:40:21.258]  This is normal!
[00:40:23.365 --> 00:40:26.288]  This is normal!
[00:40:26.288 --> 00:40:28.610]  I care enough about freedom because I don't want to be a slave.
[00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:30.851]  I'm not a hero.
[00:40:30.851 --> 00:40:34.114]  This is normal, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:34.114 --> 00:40:35.655]  I care enough about the future.
[00:40:35.655 --> 00:40:37.417]  I care enough about our society.
[00:40:37.417 --> 00:40:42.742]  I care enough about our culture, and that pure evil will not be able to take over.
[00:40:42.742 --> 00:40:46.645]  And you know, it's not even fear, but there is that, oh my God, this is going to get really bad.
[00:40:46.645 --> 00:40:47.686]  It's self-preservation.
[00:40:48.763 --> 00:40:51.945]  Because it's not a fear, it's I better resist these people.
[00:40:51.945 --> 00:40:55.747]  I better figure out the best way to fight them.
[00:40:55.747 --> 00:41:00.310]  I better really tell people how it is instead of mincing words.
[00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:02.872]  Go to Watson here in a minute.
[00:41:02.872 --> 00:41:09.896]  I just read these bills and then I've got the UN bragging here and the CDC.
[00:41:09.896 --> 00:41:11.497]  Update on immunization and pregnancy.
[00:41:11.497 --> 00:41:17.061]  Tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis vaccination recommended for women.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.241]  Update on Immunization Pregnancy.
[00:41:21.241 --> 00:41:29.949]  See, they still at the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, they hadn't gotten when the program four years ago was saying, give pregnant women shots.
[00:41:29.949 --> 00:41:31.350]  Everybody knew you didn't do that.
[00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:38.356]  Because, I mean, they used to do it and the women had miscarriages or the baby, you know, died.
[00:41:38.356 --> 00:41:40.258]  And then had to be removed.
[00:41:40.258 --> 00:41:41.438]  It's an abortion.
[00:41:41.438 --> 00:41:46.463]  And they said, well, now we're saying give it all, especially to women, even though they go on to admit
[00:41:50.327 --> 00:41:52.890]  That it can hurt the baby.
[00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:56.253]  See, they're just... The Aztecs said, we're gonna chop people's hearts out.
[00:41:56.253 --> 00:41:58.075]  It was normal, because everybody went along with it.
[00:41:58.075 --> 00:42:04.882]  And if you showed up, they had normalcy bias, and if you could speak Mayan, you know, the over culture, and you said, hey...
[00:42:05.842 --> 00:42:07.324]  Don't chop their hearts out.
[00:42:07.324 --> 00:42:10.067]  You know, the moon is a big rock that orbits our planet.
[00:42:10.067 --> 00:42:11.328]  It's not a god.
[00:42:11.328 --> 00:42:14.491]  You don't have to chop hearts out every time the moon comes up or the sun comes up.
[00:42:14.491 --> 00:42:16.173]  It's a gas ball.
[00:42:16.173 --> 00:42:17.294]  They would say, you're crazy.
[00:42:17.294 --> 00:42:22.120]  We all agree that the god needs the blood of children and women and men.
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.181]  And they also sold the meat.
[00:42:23.181 --> 00:42:24.883]  They hung the folks up like lunch meat.
[00:42:24.883 --> 00:42:27.766]  And that was how the priest class made their money was off the sale of human flesh.
[00:42:30.126 --> 00:42:32.288]  You would be crazy, just like I'm crazy.
[00:42:32.288 --> 00:42:33.749]  I'm like, this is really bad, folks.
[00:42:33.749 --> 00:42:35.210]  They're like, those are doctors.
[00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:36.431]  They care about the children.
[00:42:36.431 --> 00:42:36.991]  I'm like, oh really?
[00:42:36.991 --> 00:42:38.793]  Here's the document where they're killing you.
[00:42:38.793 --> 00:42:39.974]  And the average doctor doesn't even know.
[00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:41.735]  They're just compartmentalized idiots.
[00:42:41.735 --> 00:42:43.136]  And the kid has a convulsion.
[00:42:43.136 --> 00:42:46.079]  Now they're telling doctors, because they're souping up the vaccines.
[00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:47.320]  This came out last year.
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.280]  It's normal.
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.163]  Tell people that a convulsion may be normal.
[00:42:51.163 --> 00:42:59.069]  But if your kid has a convulsion, when you take them out of the hospital, which happens most of the time, about 10 hours later, eight hours later, they're going to take your kids, even if they live.
[00:43:00.882 --> 00:43:03.084]  Now they're going to tell you, now there may be a convulsion.
[00:43:03.084 --> 00:43:05.185]  When you go in, you're sitting there.
[00:43:05.185 --> 00:43:07.587]  Now, your baby may have a convulsion tonight.
[00:43:07.587 --> 00:43:09.128]  Or, okay?
[00:43:09.128 --> 00:43:11.569]  Or even today, it's quite normal.
[00:43:11.569 --> 00:43:12.450]  Hey, there you go.
[00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:14.131]  Thank you very much for visiting.
[00:43:14.131 --> 00:43:16.012]  Oh, thank you, doctor, and your priest suit.
[00:43:16.012 --> 00:43:17.073]  Your white priest robe.
[00:43:17.073 --> 00:43:18.534]  Oh, thank you, Lucifer.
[00:43:18.534 --> 00:43:20.135]  You're wearing a Lucifer robe.
[00:43:20.135 --> 00:43:21.997]  Thank you, Lucifer, and your white robes.
[00:43:21.997 --> 00:43:23.878]  Saturday's the black robes of the judge.
[00:43:23.878 --> 00:43:25.699]  Oh, thank you, Lucifer.
[00:43:25.699 --> 00:43:26.560]  Wearing a Lucifer rug.
[00:43:27.961 --> 00:43:28.901]  Wearing a Lucifer robe?
[00:43:28.901 --> 00:43:31.522]  I mean, see, that's what's wrong when you know all this stuff.
[00:43:31.522 --> 00:43:35.603]  It's all symbols, it's all in your face, the double snakes, the helix of the DNA.
[00:43:35.603 --> 00:43:37.204]  They knew that thousands of years ago.
[00:43:37.204 --> 00:43:39.924]  They didn't just discover that.
[00:43:39.924 --> 00:43:45.726]  You got these dumbed-down, lower-level, priest-class doctors who don't even know what they're part of.
[00:43:45.726 --> 00:43:50.907]  And we have to sit here and watch all of this unfold, and watch all of this go on.
[00:43:50.907 --> 00:43:52.048]  I'm tired of it!
[00:43:52.048 --> 00:43:53.068]  I've had enough of it!
[00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:57.855]  They're killing us!
[00:43:57.855 --> 00:43:58.815]  Look at the numbers!
[00:43:58.815 --> 00:44:00.156]  They're killing us!
[00:44:00.156 --> 00:44:01.277]  CBS News!
[00:44:01.277 --> 00:44:03.639]  Aspartame gives you top new diabetes!
[00:44:03.639 --> 00:44:09.924]  But, oh, Michelle Obama, she says cut your calories, not, hey, you know, you can't have aspartame.
[00:44:09.924 --> 00:44:12.866]  If they came out and said that, I'd be like, whoa, okay, they're not bad.
[00:44:12.866 --> 00:44:14.027]  They're waking up to eugenics.
[00:44:14.027 --> 00:44:14.427]  They're not.
[00:44:14.427 --> 00:44:17.189]  They are eugenicists.
[00:44:17.189 --> 00:44:19.330]  And so all these bills are being introduced.
[00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:20.091]  All this is happening.
[00:44:20.091 --> 00:44:21.412]  It passed in California.
[00:44:21.412 --> 00:44:22.853]  They give little kids shots.
[00:44:22.853 --> 00:44:23.994]  Do you want a shot?
[00:44:23.994 --> 00:44:25.015]  Do you want the candy?
[00:44:25.882 --> 00:44:27.784]  You don't want to die, do you?
[00:44:27.784 --> 00:44:29.686]  I guess, all right, I'll take the shot.
[00:44:29.686 --> 00:44:33.791]  All right, now, you could get a little sick.
[00:44:33.791 --> 00:44:38.316]  They have them sign a form, that's in this bill, to your 10-year-old.
[00:44:38.316 --> 00:44:39.257]  Sign the form.
[00:44:39.257 --> 00:44:40.959]  Imagine the devil coming to a 10-year-old.
[00:44:40.959 --> 00:44:42.660]  You sign the contract.
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:44.522]  You don't, you can't give consent.
[00:44:45.603 --> 00:44:52.609]  A 10-year-old can't walk into a Corvette dealership and say, I want that $70,000 Corvette and sign their name.
[00:44:52.609 --> 00:44:54.431]  They can't walk into a liquor store.
[00:44:54.431 --> 00:44:56.072]  They can't walk in and buy a gun.
[00:44:56.072 --> 00:44:58.314]  They don't have the age of consent.
[00:44:58.314 --> 00:45:00.356]  They don't have the age of consent.
[00:45:00.356 --> 00:45:02.318]  They don't have the age of consent.
[00:45:02.318 --> 00:45:04.840]  They don't have the age of consent!
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.963]  I mean, this is literally like the government acting like a pedophile.
[00:45:09.537 --> 00:45:10.518]  And then they just do it!
[00:45:10.518 --> 00:45:12.759]  Alright, I'm going to shut up and go to Paul Watson.
[00:45:12.759 --> 00:45:15.120]  This is big breaking news.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:35.112]  And Paul, you know, later in the article you break down, as we have documented over the past part of the decade, Internet Plan B or Internet 2 would be a perfect excuse for authoritarians to replace the current Wild West Internet system with a newly regulated censored structure under which everyone would require permission and approval to operate a website.
[00:45:35.632 --> 00:46:01.050]  Well, that's what they say since 2000 at Internet2 Consortium, and I know you linked a couple of our old articles here, but I want you or Steve or somebody to come out with another headline explaining that protecting the Internet is the plan to kill the Internet, because they've said that, and then the threats they talk about now in this new fear-mongering are threats that they're engineering, and saying,
[00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:04.452]  You know, the power systems on the internet, not true.
[00:46:04.452 --> 00:46:06.854]  The gas systems on the internet, not true.
[00:46:06.854 --> 00:46:15.100]  And then they use case point examples to put their hub in to kill the old internet, to shut it down with red tape, and then force us onto the new highly controlled one.
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.682]  They say that!
[00:46:16.682 --> 00:46:19.424]  And this is not anywhere in the technology publications.
[00:46:20.965 --> 00:46:22.126]  So we need to get this out.
[00:46:22.126 --> 00:46:26.390]  But Paul Watson, I wanted you to comment on your tech guru warns of Internet disaster.
[00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:31.034]  Scientist Danny Hillis calls for Internet Plan B in times of emergency.
[00:46:31.034 --> 00:46:35.298]  He's one of the backbone, real consortium inventors of the Internet.
[00:46:35.298 --> 00:46:38.000]  And of course he's out fear-mongering forums saying, Stuxnet!
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.125]  We didn't have the Feds take over cybersecurity when cybersecurity launched Stuxnet in a false flag operation.
[00:46:44.125 --> 00:46:44.666]  Paul Watson.
[00:46:46.045 --> 00:46:47.027]  Hi Alex.
[00:46:47.027 --> 00:46:59.803]  This is an interview that Danny Hillis, who basically created some of the first supercomputers at MIT, he gave an interview to Michael Copeland of Wired.com and he said,
[00:47:00.791 --> 00:47:06.496]  The threat is that there's going to be this massive denial of service attack on the entire internet.
[00:47:06.496 --> 00:47:07.897]  Offered no proof for that.
[00:47:07.897 --> 00:47:14.864]  Of course, we know the internet's not... And Homeland's putting grids now, microgrids, in to be able to do that.
[00:47:14.864 --> 00:47:16.885]  It's their internet kill switch on record.
[00:47:16.885 --> 00:47:18.247]  See, they couldn't shut it down.
[00:47:18.247 --> 00:47:21.810]  Now they are setting it up to do that and then claim someone else did it.
[00:47:22.776 --> 00:47:38.624]  Well, the new cyber security regulations that a lot of the major infrastructure companies and bodies are having to adhere to are all based around the fact that the DHS invents and runs all the regulations.
[00:47:38.624 --> 00:47:41.425]  But yeah, they're going to be running a huge part of it.
[00:47:41.425 --> 00:47:42.626]  But he basically said,
[00:47:43.186 --> 00:47:50.814]  That we need a new internet to kind of kick in as a backup generator if the original one goes down.
[00:47:50.814 --> 00:47:54.958]  Hey, this restaurant isn't working well that builds its own self and is the real World Wide Web.
[00:47:54.958 --> 00:47:58.902]  We're going to build a new one next door and then, by the way, somebody's going to burn down the old one.
[00:47:58.902 --> 00:47:59.463]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:48:00.444 --> 00:48:03.466]  And he says that hygiene will be required.
[00:48:03.466 --> 00:48:08.289]  And what that's going to look like, basically, you know what it's going to look like.
[00:48:08.289 --> 00:48:10.370]  Internet ID, internet taxes, total control.
[00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:11.391]  Oh yes, the Chinese system.
[00:48:11.391 --> 00:48:13.192]  It's the very thing Lieberman called for.
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:14.921]  I mean, it's insane.
[00:48:14.921 --> 00:48:18.243]  You were talking about the denials over the bullet purchases.
[00:48:18.243 --> 00:48:26.949]  When Lieberman was pushing the Chinese-style internet, he called the concerns that it was going to be a Chinese-style internet, quote, total misinformation.
[00:48:26.949 --> 00:48:29.751]  And then, a day later, he goes on CNN and says,
[00:48:30.572 --> 00:48:36.119]  Why can't we shut down the internet like China can in times of emergency?
[00:48:36.119 --> 00:48:44.029]  So on the one hand they call you a paranoid nutcase for being concerned about it, then the next day they come out and say that very thing.
[00:48:44.029 --> 00:48:45.671]  So that's precisely what it's going to be.
[00:48:46.232 --> 00:48:54.500]  Well, even CNET News of CBS admitted, and Declan McCullough, that the cybersecurity plan they've wanted that Congress wouldn't pass, so Obama just says he's doing it.
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:57.282]  That's dictatorship, but we're extreme for not liking it.
[00:48:57.282 --> 00:48:58.384]  Take your tetanus shot, folks.
[00:48:58.384 --> 00:48:58.924]  Time to die.
[00:48:58.924 --> 00:49:00.445]  I mean, that's no big deal either.
[00:49:00.445 --> 00:49:03.909]  Everything's fine, nothing to worry about, hidden in plain view.
[00:49:03.909 --> 00:49:09.254]  That is exactly what their cybersecurity plan does, is quote, Chinese-style net censorship.
[00:49:10.247 --> 00:49:13.151]  Well this is a quote from the New York Times, an editorial in 2009.
[00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:30.331]  So that's exactly what it is.
[00:49:30.331 --> 00:49:31.792]  It's the end of anonymity.
[00:49:31.792 --> 00:49:32.773]  It's permission.
[00:49:32.773 --> 00:49:34.554]  It's a license to use the internet.
[00:49:34.554 --> 00:49:36.915]  And then they kill the old web and force you on.
[00:49:36.915 --> 00:49:43.639]  And they always make the new slave system the new trendy fashion thing of, oh, I'm having my feet bound so I can't walk.
[00:49:43.639 --> 00:49:45.580]  I'm upper class Chinese.
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:47.441]  Or, you know, I'm killing my baby girl.
[00:49:47.441 --> 00:49:48.362]  That's trendy.
[00:49:48.362 --> 00:49:49.662]  Or abortion's trendy.
[00:49:49.662 --> 00:49:51.864]  Hey, sticking your hand in a blender, it's so trendy.
[00:49:51.864 --> 00:49:53.285]  Slitting your throat is so trendy.
[00:49:53.285 --> 00:49:53.585]  Go ahead.
[00:49:54.707 --> 00:49:58.029]  Yeah, it's going to be a no-fly list for cyberspace.
[00:49:58.029 --> 00:50:06.935]  And what's rich about it, this is what this tech guru talks about, one of the reasons why they want it, is because of all these viruses that have emerged in the last few years.
[00:50:06.935 --> 00:50:12.958]  The last five of which, as were admitted, were created by the US and Israel.
[00:50:12.958 --> 00:50:18.662]  Flame, Stuxnet, and the last three that emerged last year, all created by the US and Israel.
[00:50:18.922 --> 00:50:25.527]  So they're saying we need a new internet, a new secure internet with no freedoms because of cyber security.
[00:50:25.527 --> 00:50:29.210]  And then they're launching all the cyber security attacks.
[00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:38.037]  Kurt, four years ago wrote an article where the head of cyber security in the Pentagon, as they've already set it up, said we're going to attack the web and force you on the new one.
[00:50:38.037 --> 00:50:39.058]  I mean, they're admitting it.
[00:50:39.058 --> 00:50:39.638]  Stay there, Paul.
[00:50:39.638 --> 00:50:41.079]  I want to finish up with this.
[00:50:41.079 --> 00:50:41.920]  Folks, this is so big.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.001]  Paul, your headline should be,
[00:50:44.338 --> 00:50:48.625]  Obama launches false flags on the internet in bid to take it over.
[00:50:48.625 --> 00:50:49.806]  I mean, that's what it is.
[00:50:49.806 --> 00:50:52.811]  So, I want another article just on what you just said.
[00:50:52.811 --> 00:50:55.635]  Your article's great, but, I mean, it's not hardcore.
[00:50:55.635 --> 00:50:59.181]  You go with the enemy's headline, reality's ten times worse.
[00:50:59.181 --> 00:50:59.661]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.257 --> 00:51:02.818]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[00:51:02.818 --> 00:51:04.619]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[00:51:04.619 --> 00:51:06.961]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[00:51:06.961 --> 00:51:08.682]  What can you not live without?
[00:51:08.682 --> 00:51:10.403]  What is your greatest dependency?
[00:51:10.403 --> 00:51:11.384]  Is it your guns?
[00:51:11.384 --> 00:51:12.344]  Is it your home?
[00:51:12.344 --> 00:51:13.765]  No, it's food.
[00:51:13.765 --> 00:51:15.867]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[00:51:15.867 --> 00:51:19.369]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[00:51:19.369 --> 00:51:20.610]  Don't be dependent.
[00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:21.710]  Be self-sufficient.
[00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:23.351]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[00:51:23.351 --> 00:51:24.012]  Feed yourself.
[00:51:24.452 --> 00:51:26.693]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[00:51:26.693 --> 00:51:30.235]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoodsDirect.

[00:53:52.664 --> 00:54:05.874]  MyPatriotSupply.com MyPatriotSupply.com Ladies and gentlemen, what's happening is really very simple.
[00:54:05.874 --> 00:54:07.635]  The complexity of the world
[00:54:14.904 --> 00:54:21.569]  It is so massive and deep that people just give up and say, hey, I just get in my car, drive to work, come home.
[00:54:21.569 --> 00:54:30.436]  And while you're doing that, the technocrats are putting out propaganda about party, have fun, everything's silly, everybody's silly, let's be silly, everybody's friendly.
[00:54:30.436 --> 00:54:34.439]  Well, it's just hardcore, pure evil, beyond Hades.
[00:54:34.439 --> 00:54:38.762]  I mean, it is the mind of the devil is all I can describe this as.
[00:54:38.762 --> 00:54:41.645]  And those of us that study it are just like, whoa!
[00:54:43.635 --> 00:54:53.457]  I mean, yeah, they launch the five attacks, admit they launch them, and then say, as I predicted, we've got to take your internet freedom and put you on the internet, too, because of these attacks.
[00:54:53.457 --> 00:54:56.938]  In one case, they even blamed Iran for Stuxnet.
[00:54:56.938 --> 00:55:00.159]  Again, they go, oh, Alex Jones is discredited.
[00:55:00.159 --> 00:55:01.739]  Yeah, I bought the bullets.
[00:55:01.739 --> 00:55:03.300]  And he goes, yeah, we bought 200,000.
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:08.421]  And it mentions one tiny little line from purchases and goes, see, he's worried about that.
[00:55:08.421 --> 00:55:11.782]  That's only a few bullets for the officers of the Social Security Administration.
[00:55:11.782 --> 00:55:12.282]  What's the big deal?
[00:55:13.459 --> 00:55:15.000]  Politico did it again today.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.062]  Feds, media rebut Sarah Palin's stockpiling bullets claim.
[00:55:18.062 --> 00:55:22.866]  Of course, she said feds are stockpiling bullets for civil unrest.
[00:55:22.866 --> 00:55:23.106]  No kidding.
[00:55:23.106 --> 00:55:24.246]  That's what they're training for, too.
[00:55:24.246 --> 00:55:25.627]  That's what the manuals say.
[00:55:25.627 --> 00:55:26.608]  We know.
[00:55:26.608 --> 00:55:30.111]  But they count on your ignorance and go, hey, there's no drones.
[00:55:30.111 --> 00:55:31.472]  Gibbs is like, yeah, the public's idiots.
[00:55:31.472 --> 00:55:33.573]  I told them there were no drones, even though they're admitted.
[00:55:33.573 --> 00:55:36.555]  Ha, ha, ha, that's a good one.
[00:55:36.555 --> 00:55:37.836]  Yeah, Alex is a kook.
[00:55:37.836 --> 00:55:39.097]  Yeah, yeah, there's no bullets.
[00:55:41.758 --> 00:55:43.219]  I mean, that's Creepville, folks.
[00:55:43.219 --> 00:55:44.280]  That's Creepville.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:46.621]  I mean, Politico, what a joke!
[00:55:46.621 --> 00:55:49.783]  And everything's getting worse because all the standards are gone.
[00:55:49.783 --> 00:55:54.126]  And they've told the media, you will do whatever we say or you'll never get access to us.
[00:55:54.126 --> 00:55:57.608]  So Politico's like, well, I'll lie and say whatever you want then.
[00:55:57.608 --> 00:55:59.029]  They're like, alright, you get the access back.
[00:56:00.353 --> 00:56:02.574]  See, this technocracy, none of you are going to be needed.
[00:56:02.574 --> 00:56:03.874]  All of you that serve the system.
[00:56:03.874 --> 00:56:04.895]  I'm going back to Watson.

[00:56:44.582 --> 00:56:50.165]  Paul, I'm going to keep you five more minutes ahead of Ted Nugent joining us in the next hour, but I've been ranting.
[00:56:50.165 --> 00:56:54.586]  Keep going with what's in your key article at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:54.586 --> 00:56:57.007]  Tech guru warns of internet disaster.
[00:56:57.007 --> 00:57:01.369]  The answer is give the government all the power and select corporations and go ahead.
[00:57:02.691 --> 00:57:16.597]  Well, the point of it is, you know, the biggest objections to the 15th century Guttenberg press came from organisations in positions of power, because before that all the books were written by hand.
[00:57:16.597 --> 00:57:21.300]  This allowed books to be written and published quicker, circulated to more people.
[00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:23.881]  They no longer controlled the flow of information.
[00:57:24.241 --> 00:57:29.744]  The internet is the 21st century Guttenberg press and it's got the potential to be so much more.
[00:57:29.744 --> 00:57:31.465]  That's why they want to shut it down.
[00:57:31.465 --> 00:57:35.828]  They want to strangle independent voices, bloggers, alternative media.
[00:57:35.828 --> 00:57:40.751]  They want to give you approval like, you know, you're on the no-fly list to use the internet in the first place.
[00:57:41.471 --> 00:57:42.772]  No due process.
[00:57:42.772 --> 00:57:44.914]  The entire Magna Carta overthrown.
[00:57:44.914 --> 00:57:46.435]  And this is the essence.
[00:57:46.435 --> 00:57:55.943]  Now that they know that we know they're liars, they're now going to the psychological tactic of gaslighting, where they just openly lie in front of us, admit they're lying, and laugh to make you feel helpless.
[00:57:55.943 --> 00:57:59.146]  I don't think it's going to work.
[00:57:59.146 --> 00:57:59.786]  It's amazing.
[00:57:59.786 --> 00:58:02.609]  I mean, this Sarah Palin thing, just to touch on it.
[00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:10.640]  There's an article on Slate entitled, Sarah Palin's new conspiracy theory was debunked before she even wrote about it.
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:18.051]  And they say that the origin of the Fed's buying bullet was an anonymous email that began making the rounds this past summer.
[00:58:18.051 --> 00:58:19.654]  Yeah, yeah, they're running a hoax!
[00:58:20.074 --> 00:58:20.674]  Stay there.
[00:58:20.674 --> 00:58:21.915]  They're running a hoax.
[00:58:21.915 --> 00:58:22.915]  Exactly.
[00:58:22.915 --> 00:58:25.036]  On record, it's the federal purchase orders.
[00:58:25.036 --> 00:58:26.557]  It's all been admitted for a year.
[00:58:26.557 --> 00:58:28.938]  It's up to two billion bullets, AP Reuters.
[00:58:28.938 --> 00:58:32.700]  And now they're saying Sarah Palin's insane off a rumor.
[00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:35.581]  There are no bullets when it's all admitted.
[00:58:35.581 --> 00:58:36.661]  There are no drones.
[00:58:36.661 --> 00:58:43.164]  There are no cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:58:43.164 --> 00:58:47.126]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:58.094]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[00:58:58.094 --> 00:59:02.736]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.
[00:59:02.736 --> 00:59:13.542]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary, broad-spectrum, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal solution that can be used inside the body as well as on the skin.
[00:59:13.542 --> 00:59:18.785]  Supernatural Silver is unique and superior to colloidal and ionic silvers.

[01:00:05.233 --> 01:00:10.074]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:11.654]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.654 --> 01:00:13.194]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.194 --> 01:00:17.395]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.395 --> 01:00:23.016]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.016 --> 01:00:32.118]  Yeah, I'm ranting and raving, and I called Paul this morning and I said, look, he wrote this Sarah Palin article about her warning about the feds getting ready for civil war.
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:39.565]  I said, do you know it's all over the authoritarian news that camouflages itself as liberal?
[01:00:39.565 --> 01:00:42.007]  You know, the pinhead propagandists, Winston Smiths?
[01:00:42.961 --> 01:00:44.323]  They're in the Ministry of Truth.
[01:00:44.323 --> 01:00:47.046]  Did you know that they're saying that there are no bullets?
[01:00:47.046 --> 01:01:00.341]  See, they've gone from just taking billions and looking at me, you know, a few hundred thousand here and saying, that's all there is, that's not that many bullets, ignoring all the other purchases, lying by omission to their audience, and now they've just gone to, there are no bullets!
[01:01:00.341 --> 01:01:01.342]  It's insane!
[01:01:01.342 --> 01:01:03.104]  Yeah, yeah, that's in Politico too, Paul.
[01:01:03.985 --> 01:01:06.326]  They all, like, rewrite some White House memo.
[01:01:06.326 --> 01:01:07.866]  I'm telling you, I've never seen such plagiarism.
[01:01:07.866 --> 01:01:09.587]  I don't know who the plagiarist is.
[01:01:09.587 --> 01:01:13.828]  Washington Post, AP, Politico, Slate.
[01:01:13.828 --> 01:01:15.629]  It's all the same thing.
[01:01:15.629 --> 01:01:21.151]  In some cases, the same sentences without attribution, just saying, there are no bullets, Paul.
[01:01:21.151 --> 01:01:24.992]  It doesn't matter if the government's already responded why they bought $2 billion.
[01:01:24.992 --> 01:01:25.733]  It doesn't exist.
[01:01:25.733 --> 01:01:26.613]  You understand that, Paul?
[01:01:27.293 --> 01:01:28.914]  You want to apologize?
[01:01:28.914 --> 01:01:30.634]  On the one hand, they say it's not happening.
[01:01:30.634 --> 01:01:33.215]  Then they say, well yeah, they did buy all these bullets.
[01:01:33.215 --> 01:01:36.357]  Then on the one hand, they say, oh, it's to save money buying in bulk.
[01:01:36.357 --> 01:01:39.758]  And then on the other hand, they say, oh, it's just for training practice.
[01:01:39.758 --> 01:01:49.381]  I noticed that none of them reported on the fact that a $2 million DHS contractor produced shooting targets of pregnant women, children, and gun owners.
[01:01:49.381 --> 01:01:50.402]  They were all quiet.
[01:01:51.543 --> 01:01:54.526]  No one's touched that, even though the company's confirmed it, it's admitted.
[01:01:54.526 --> 01:02:12.545]  Listen, you know we never fire the bat beam and ask Drudge to link to something, but Palin's big news, this could really wake up a lot of mainline conservatives here, we need to do an article where we break down the whole bullet hoax, like leftist run hoax against Palin, because now that Slate and others are saying there are no bullets,
[01:02:13.306 --> 01:02:18.351]  I mean, that really discredits them, that she made it up, and they don't even show the anonymous letter.
[01:02:18.351 --> 01:02:22.335]  It's like, that was some guy made that up on the side of the road.
[01:02:22.335 --> 01:02:25.978]  It's all a huge story for over a year on Drudge.
[01:02:25.978 --> 01:02:28.801]  We broke it, and then they're acting like it doesn't exist, Paul.
[01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:34.911]  And they also deny that the DHS preparing for civil unrest.
[01:02:34.911 --> 01:02:39.813]  We had the army documents where they openly said they're planning to shoot rioters in America.
[01:02:39.813 --> 01:02:47.737]  Then the DHS itself, last year, bought a bunch of body armor, admittedly because it was preparing for, quote, riots in America.
[01:02:47.737 --> 01:02:51.899]  They're buying full-auto armored vehicles, heavy tanks being delivered.
[01:02:51.899 --> 01:02:54.600]  I mean, it is a mad build-up.
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.342]  They're like, nothing's building up, there's no bullets.
[01:02:57.342 --> 01:02:59.503]  I mean, that lets you know, folks, how much danger we're in.
[01:03:01.573 --> 01:03:05.175]  They're just regurgitating what the federal government told them.
[01:03:05.175 --> 01:03:07.536]  Last time I checked, that wasn't journalism.
[01:03:07.536 --> 01:03:10.218]  You have to actually investigate the claims.
[01:03:10.218 --> 01:03:11.839]  They're lying, Paul.
[01:03:11.839 --> 01:03:13.660]  Everyone knows about the bullets.
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:18.042]  It's like saying Los Angeles doesn't exist in Politico.
[01:03:18.042 --> 01:03:19.023]  That's how dumb they think.
[01:03:19.023 --> 01:03:20.443]  This is a scandal, Paul.
[01:03:20.443 --> 01:03:21.864]  This is a scandal.
[01:03:21.864 --> 01:03:23.605]  And they want to just get us used to it.
[01:03:23.605 --> 01:03:26.727]  You see all the articles, Drudge is crazy, linking to this.
[01:03:26.727 --> 01:03:27.607]  There's no bullets.
[01:03:27.607 --> 01:03:30.249]  I mean, it has reached cuckoo level.
[01:03:31.707 --> 01:03:35.790]  Another one says, it appears Palin is joining the conspiracy mongers.
[01:03:35.790 --> 01:03:40.133]  Growth in the tinfoil hat business could totally offset those pesky budget cuts.
[01:03:40.133 --> 01:03:42.294]  So now there's no bullets whatsoever.
[01:03:42.294 --> 01:03:45.236]  It's all a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory.
[01:03:45.236 --> 01:03:49.579]  You can go on the FedBizOpps website and see what the DHS is buying.
[01:03:49.579 --> 01:03:50.820]  Two billion now.
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.821]  Two billion.
[01:03:52.821 --> 01:03:54.282]  Two billion.
[01:03:54.282 --> 01:03:55.963]  We were wrong two weeks ago saying 1.75.
[01:03:55.963 --> 01:03:56.263]  Two billion.
[01:03:59.448 --> 01:04:02.010]  But now $2 billion is the new zero, Winston.
[01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:05.292]  If I tell you $2 billion is zero, Winston Smith, it is.
[01:04:05.292 --> 01:04:07.014]  Are you saying that isn't the case?
[01:04:07.014 --> 01:04:08.335]  How many figures am I holding up, Paul?
[01:04:09.793 --> 01:04:14.095]  Well, you know, two plus two equals five to the mainstream media, I guess.
[01:04:14.095 --> 01:04:14.716]  It's just crazy.
[01:04:14.716 --> 01:04:20.499]  It's an insult to people's intelligence that they just regurgitate this crap and shovel it out every time.
[01:04:20.499 --> 01:04:22.760]  But notice how we're not even freaking out, though.
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:29.384]  This is bald-faced, concerted lies saying Sarah Palin is an idiot and going off an internet rumor.
[01:04:29.384 --> 01:04:32.046]  We've caught them in an absolute total fraud hoax.
[01:04:34.096 --> 01:04:34.656]  It's huge!
[01:04:34.656 --> 01:04:35.416]  And no one even cares.
[01:04:35.416 --> 01:04:36.417]  They got us used to it.
[01:04:36.417 --> 01:04:40.018]  No one even cares that Gibbs is like, yeah, we lie to you all the time.
[01:04:40.018 --> 01:04:41.738]  And MSNBC's like, ha ha ha!
[01:04:41.738 --> 01:04:42.638]  Oh, it's so funny!
[01:04:42.638 --> 01:04:44.539]  Let me tell you another one I told the idiots!
[01:04:44.539 --> 01:04:46.420]  I mean, that's what they think of people.
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:47.240]  You're like, hey, you're lying.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:47.840]  Shut up, racist.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.740]  Oh, you don't like being called racist?
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:50.761]  That's right, racist.
[01:04:50.761 --> 01:04:53.862]  Alex, you're racist because you say MSNBC lies.
[01:04:53.862 --> 01:04:54.542]  That's racist.
[01:04:54.542 --> 01:04:56.982]  Thank you, Paul Watson.
[01:04:56.982 --> 01:04:57.883]  Here comes Ted Nugent.

[01:06:03.331 --> 01:06:08.336]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:06:08.336 --> 01:06:15.523]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:06:15.643 --> 01:06:21.265]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[01:07:10.022 --> 01:07:13.905]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:11.422]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:34.868]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely excited to have the one, the only Ted Nugent joining us in a powerhouse interview.
[01:08:34.868 --> 01:08:43.075]  And the reason I know it's going to be a powerhouse, I had a chance to have him call into the Sunday weekend show, listening right here in Central Texas as he was driving.
[01:08:43.795 --> 01:08:48.678]  And then I had a chance to talk to him off air about some of the other topics he wanted to come on air and talk about.
[01:08:48.678 --> 01:08:51.060]  So a lot of this is going to be news breaking.
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:09:00.106]  His new tour, the Black Power Tour, is celebrating the fathers of rock and roll, incredible black Americans, and they're demonizing that in the media.
[01:09:00.786 --> 01:09:09.591]  I mean, there's nothing that Ted Nugent can't do right because he's pro-liberty and the Marxist Decepticons are out there trying to divide and conquer this country.
[01:09:09.591 --> 01:09:10.971]  We're going to talk about that.
[01:09:10.971 --> 01:09:13.052]  We're going to talk about how he's been persecuted by the Feds.
[01:09:13.052 --> 01:09:16.954]  We're going to talk about how he's got one of the most popular ammo lines in the country.
[01:09:16.954 --> 01:09:20.036]  We're going to talk, most importantly, about taking America back.
[01:09:20.036 --> 01:09:22.457]  We've got him for the full hour.
[01:09:22.457 --> 01:09:23.478]  You want Ted Nugent?
[01:09:23.478 --> 01:09:26.339]  I had to do some serious begging, but we've got him.
[01:09:26.339 --> 01:09:27.780]  Uncle Ted, great to have you back with us.
[01:09:28.732 --> 01:09:29.735]  I feel welcome.
[01:09:29.735 --> 01:09:33.044]  Even when I'm not here, I feel that I'm represented accurately by you.
[01:09:33.044 --> 01:09:36.814]  So on behalf of a working hard, playing hard, logical America, thank you.
[01:09:37.802 --> 01:09:38.942]  Wow, where should we start?
[01:09:38.942 --> 01:09:40.723]  You heard some of the topics I threw out.
[01:09:40.723 --> 01:09:41.584]  Well, where should we begin?
[01:09:41.584 --> 01:09:46.445]  Let's talk about your big rock and roll tour coming up and the media trying to a lot of people.
[01:09:46.445 --> 01:09:50.687]  Well, you know, for the last, I think this is my 55th year touring or something like that.
[01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:53.628]  I started back in Detroit in the 1950s.
[01:09:53.628 --> 01:09:55.369]  My band won the Battle of the Bands.
[01:09:55.369 --> 01:10:00.371]  We actually opened up for the Supremes and the Bolt Brothels at the brand new Cobo Hall back in 1962 or 63.
[01:10:00.371 --> 01:10:00.491]  Wow.
[01:10:02.892 --> 01:10:05.376]  You know, I just don't have any white musical influences.
[01:10:05.376 --> 01:10:08.781]  I thought Pat Boone was weird, and I thought Little Richard was God, you know what I mean?
[01:10:13.147 --> 01:10:20.013]  I mean, my music has a life of its own, really.
[01:10:20.013 --> 01:10:27.299]  After 50 years of touring, the audiences still are so intense and passionate and high energy.
[01:10:27.299 --> 01:10:31.763]  And let's morph into when I discovered the Culture War.
[01:10:31.763 --> 01:10:37.848]  You know, this tour is called Ted Nugent Black Power 2013, because I'm bringing forth
[01:10:38.288 --> 01:10:41.911]  The celebration that there really is a black thing.
[01:10:41.911 --> 01:10:48.175]  And the black thing that inspired me from the very beginning was James Brown's work ethic.
[01:10:48.175 --> 01:10:50.957]  Little Richard's work ethic.
[01:10:50.957 --> 01:10:54.520]  Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley's, their work ethic.
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:58.503]  You can't become the fathers, the gods of thunder.
[01:10:58.963 --> 01:10:59.383]  I think so.
[01:11:16.536 --> 01:11:16.896]  I think so.
[01:11:36.921 --> 01:11:37.782]  I don't think so.
[01:12:00.524 --> 01:12:12.719]  So you woke up early on just because you were being yourself and being demonized and I want to ask you this question and then continue along the line and what the media is saying about your black power tour because they want to create division they can't have us come together.
[01:12:14.002 --> 01:12:25.646]  But it's so incredibly simple that this country was founded on the Second Amendment, but they try to act like it's so incredibly alien.
[01:12:25.646 --> 01:12:30.287]  I'm tired of calling them liberals or even leftists, even though that's as they're known.
[01:12:30.287 --> 01:12:32.268]  These are, as you said, Maoist.
[01:12:32.268 --> 01:12:37.870]  These are hardcore authoritarian pigs who know they're authoritarian pigs.
[01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:38.310]  They're not
[01:12:38.711 --> 01:12:40.315]  environmentalist wackos.
[01:12:40.315 --> 01:12:41.940]  They're not ignorant.
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:42.782]  They're not stupid.
[01:12:42.782 --> 01:12:46.312]  They're criminals that want to run our lives and make us their slaves.
[01:12:47.619 --> 01:12:48.560]  I couldn't have said it better.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:49.741]  They really are criminals.
[01:12:49.741 --> 01:13:12.216]  I don't care if it's Hillary Clinton refusing to provide security on the anniversary of 9-11 in some of the most dangerous areas in the world, and then getting upset because we asked her why, or that the Attorney General is running guns to Mexican drug gangs and trying to blame mom-and-pop gun shops for the criminality of his directive and his program.
[01:13:12.216 --> 01:13:16.739]  It really is like, I don't know if it's one flew over the cuckoo's nest, soylent green,
[01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:17.299]  Yes.
[01:13:17.299 --> 01:13:17.359]  Yes.
[01:13:45.875 --> 01:13:50.434]  Anti-American and anti-Constitution, anti-we the people, isn't that insanity?
[01:13:51.007 --> 01:13:51.807]  No, you can't.
[01:13:51.807 --> 01:13:55.289]  And I apologize for interrupting you and getting you off into the tyrants.
[01:13:55.289 --> 01:13:59.551]  I just want to... You are so prominent and know so many other prominent people.
[01:13:59.551 --> 01:14:03.552]  I think it's time to start a campaign to say we're really the liberals.
[01:14:03.552 --> 01:14:06.673]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal saying more freedom.
[01:14:06.673 --> 01:14:10.435]  George Washington was a liberal meaning more freedom.
[01:14:10.435 --> 01:14:16.397]  I think they've stolen the term liberal or even progressive saying let's build our country up.
[01:14:16.397 --> 01:14:17.678]  It's time to call them what they are.
[01:14:18.138 --> 01:14:30.087]  A cult, a gang of criminals that want a managed, organized economy controlled by them and their cronies and that they have basically occupied this country and there's no living with them.
[01:14:30.087 --> 01:14:34.470]  We either take this country back and win the war or we're going to be slaves.
[01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:38.313]  No more win the battles and just let the enemy keep launching attacks.
[01:14:38.313 --> 01:14:39.274]  It's time to go on
[01:14:39.594 --> 01:14:44.917]  The total offense as the gun manufacturers are doing, as you're doing, as I'm doing.
[01:14:44.917 --> 01:14:46.058]  That's why they're scared of us.
[01:14:46.058 --> 01:14:49.840]  Let's talk about Ted Nugent taking America and then the world back.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.681]  How do we get on the offense?
[01:14:51.681 --> 01:14:53.942]  And do you agree there's no more quarter?
[01:14:53.942 --> 01:14:55.363]  They're not giving us quarter.
[01:14:55.363 --> 01:14:57.464]  We either take it all back or we're going to lose.
[01:14:57.884 --> 01:14:59.665]  Well, you're absolutely correct.
[01:14:59.665 --> 01:15:05.787]  I think it can best be framed in the call that you took the other day when I dropped my cell signal.
[01:15:05.787 --> 01:15:11.829]  And I think it was Doug, a cross-country trucker, who said he was proud that Ted came over to our side.
[01:15:11.829 --> 01:15:13.410]  Alex, are you kidding me?
[01:15:14.997 --> 01:15:15.577]  I mean, it's clueless.
[01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:38.583]  Now, with all due respect, especially to my good trucking buddies who use a power service diesel additive, but can you believe that that kind of ignorance exists, that people are unaware that in the Rolling Stone cover stories, on the cover of Rolling Stone with a Walter PPK that I actually had on me in New York City during the photo shoot celebrating the Second Amendment for the
[01:15:38.883 --> 01:15:39.724]  We're good.
[01:15:59.017 --> 01:16:01.198]  I have been on the
[01:16:20.186 --> 01:16:20.726]  I think so.
[01:16:42.639 --> 01:16:43.719]  Look in a person's eye.
[01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:15.812]  Ask them, what do you believe about the death tax?
[01:17:15.812 --> 01:17:24.354]  Do you believe that the government can steal from families after tax savings when mom or dad die?
[01:17:24.354 --> 01:17:30.636]  Do you believe the government can steal after tax savings from a family
[01:17:31.169 --> 01:17:41.797]  I think that that should be the law of the land, because if the person says, yes, I believe in it, you're looking at the enemy of freedom, the enemy of America, and a thief.
[01:17:41.797 --> 01:17:48.041]  If a person wants to get rid of the death tax, if you want to compromise gun rights, you're looking at the enemy.
[01:17:48.041 --> 01:17:50.863]  We don't need no more compromise.
[01:17:50.863 --> 01:17:54.066]  When I was on Capitol Hill last week, or recently,
[01:17:54.466 --> 01:17:56.148]  For the State of the Union Address.
[01:17:56.148 --> 01:18:01.556]  I shook every Republican's hand and I wouldn't let go and I tried to shake it like Chesky Puller.
[01:18:01.556 --> 01:18:04.900]  Looked him in the eye and went, quick with the compromise!
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:09.426]  We have compromised ourselves into a corner of communism.
[01:18:09.426 --> 01:18:10.448]  Cut it out!
[01:18:12.344 --> 01:18:19.890]  And that's why the Republicans haven't been getting the support they were getting because they clearly have been selling out on every front.
[01:18:19.890 --> 01:18:23.572]  And now we've heard this hoax of, oh, Obama has a mandate.
[01:18:23.572 --> 01:18:26.014]  We need to become socialists so we can win.
[01:18:26.014 --> 01:18:31.098]  There's no point in having a Republican Party if they become the Democratic Party.
[01:18:31.098 --> 01:18:33.800]  And so how do we hold their feet to the fire?
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:42.046]  And point out that people that are quoting Mao Zedong, the greatest mass murderer in history, are, as you said, the enemy!
[01:18:42.046 --> 01:18:45.129]  I mean, my God, it's so simple if you're informed!
[01:18:46.124 --> 01:18:47.945]  Well, again, communication.
[01:18:47.945 --> 01:18:53.148]  I have been fighting this fight in the most aggressive fashion I possibly can.
[01:18:53.148 --> 01:18:56.370]  My wife constantly shakes her finger and goes, calm down.
[01:18:56.370 --> 01:19:00.412]  You're not the only one taking this battle to the enemy.
[01:19:00.412 --> 01:19:03.034]  And I go, you know, sometimes I think I am.
[01:19:03.034 --> 01:19:13.000]  Sometimes I'll contact an elected official and they act like I'm bringing up some strange concept that the Second Amendment, by any honest scrutiny, that
[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:17.930]  The existence of the Second Amendment is my concealed weapons permit.
[01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:18.451]  Period.
[01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:22.832]  And again, people say, well, why are you so obsessed with guns?
[01:19:22.832 --> 01:19:27.115]  It's the canary in the coal mine in hundreds of other countries just in the last century.
[01:19:27.115 --> 01:19:29.437]  When they come for those, look out.
[01:19:29.437 --> 01:19:32.099]  And look, they're going after every other right.
[01:19:32.099 --> 01:19:33.440]  We're going to go on a break.
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.642]  We're going to come back with Ted Nugent.
[01:19:35.642 --> 01:19:36.722]  He needs no introduction.
[01:19:36.722 --> 01:19:38.944]  TedNugent.com.
[01:19:38.944 --> 01:19:42.447]  And I want to get more into this tour and how the media is trying to demonize it, too.
[01:19:42.447 --> 01:19:43.508]  I just find that intriguing.
[01:19:43.508 --> 01:19:46.470]  We're going to get into how he's been persecuted because
[01:19:46.730 --> 01:19:48.413]  Believe me, I've gone through some of this too.
[01:19:48.413 --> 01:19:49.876]  This is serious, folks.
[01:19:49.876 --> 01:19:52.702]  You've got to support the First Amendment or we lose everything.
[01:19:52.702 --> 01:19:53.884]  Ted Nugent, straight ahead.
[01:19:53.884 --> 01:19:54.645]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:20:00.845 --> 01:20:02.666]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:20:02.666 --> 01:20:06.327]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[01:20:06.327 --> 01:20:10.888]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:20:10.888 --> 01:20:16.970]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:27.973]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[01:20:27.973 --> 01:20:30.634]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates.
[01:20:30.814 --> 01:20:34.438]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:20:34.438 --> 01:20:49.194]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[01:20:50.014 --> 01:21:01.478]  My name is Stephen Hewer.
[01:21:01.478 --> 01:21:08.800]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that most brain malfunctions have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:14.342]  So whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking, or more serious matters like inability to focus,
[01:21:14.722 --> 01:21:19.706]  My name is Angie, and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation.
[01:21:19.706 --> 01:21:23.148]  I got him on One World Way, and in two months his constipation is gone.
[01:21:23.148 --> 01:21:28.672]  He's become friendlier, he can carry on a normal conversation with me, and he's made his first friend.
[01:21:40.641 --> 01:21:44.603]  He's doing great, and he looks forward to taking One World Way every day.
[01:21:44.603 --> 01:21:49.205]  You could offer him a present or a cake, and he would prefer the One World Way.
[01:21:49.205 --> 01:21:51.387]  Go to oneworldway.com.
[01:21:51.387 --> 01:21:54.128]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[01:21:54.128 --> 01:21:54.708]  Or call 888-988-3325.
[01:21:54.708 --> 01:21:54.988]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:22:00.131 --> 01:22:04.494]  Now there's an amazing new natural antibiotic every person must have!
[01:22:04.494 --> 01:22:11.298]  It's Cells Alive Silver Solution, and it destroys over 650 hard-to-kill viruses, fungus, bacteria, and much more.
[01:22:11.298 --> 01:22:18.962]  Cells Alive Silver Solution has no expiration date, is great for emergency kits and storage shelters, and comes in 8 or 16-ounce bottles.

[01:22:21.063 --> 01:22:21.603]  Hempusa.org.
[01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:24.045]  100% chemical-free superfoods and unique health products.
[01:22:29.628 --> 01:22:38.954]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:39.755]  This capitalism?
[01:22:39.755 --> 01:22:46.019]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:46.019 --> 01:22:46.840]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:49.982]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:22:49.982 --> 01:22:50.902]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.902 --> 01:22:52.323]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:22:52.323 --> 01:22:52.643]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:52.643 --> 01:22:52.904]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.788 --> 01:23:02.071]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[01:23:02.071 --> 01:23:03.012]  Answer this.
[01:23:03.012 --> 01:23:15.287]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $35?
[01:23:16.528 --> 01:23:18.688]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[01:23:18.688 --> 01:23:20.809]  This year about one in every 50 U.S.
[01:23:20.809 --> 01:23:24.910]  homes will have a break-in, with burglars usually picking the easy target.
[01:23:24.910 --> 01:23:27.490]  A dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:23:27.490 --> 01:23:35.532]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[01:23:35.532 --> 01:23:38.493]  It's like a lamp on a timer, but far more convincing.
[01:23:38.493 --> 01:23:38.973]  And for only $34.95,
[01:23:40.273 --> 01:23:45.578]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[01:23:45.578 --> 01:23:48.261]  Go to Faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[01:23:48.261 --> 01:23:49.783]  That's 877-532-5388 or go to Faketv.com.
[01:23:49.783 --> 01:23:51.484]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:24:09.529 --> 01:24:11.350]  We are on the march.
[01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:14.491]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:24:14.491 --> 01:24:18.532]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:18.532 --> 01:24:21.753]  That's right.
[01:24:21.753 --> 01:24:22.653]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:24:22.653 --> 01:24:24.954]  You know, I'm gonna be honest here.
[01:24:24.954 --> 01:24:29.896]  If it sounds like I am in awe sometimes of Ted Nugent, it's because I am.
[01:24:31.601 --> 01:24:43.632]  Because I take it personal when people are trying to take our little ranch we've had since Texas Independence because under the estate tax we won't be able to keep it.
[01:24:43.632 --> 01:24:44.994]  In fact, it used to be a lot bigger.
[01:24:44.994 --> 01:24:50.399]  Most of it's been sold off because of estate taxes the last 50 years when grandparents and people died.
[01:24:51.081 --> 01:24:59.587]  When they're trying to take my guns, and I know it's because they're authoritarians, I've read the UN Treaty debates where they admit it's about a monopoly of power of the government.
[01:24:59.587 --> 01:25:00.728]  I take it personal.
[01:25:00.728 --> 01:25:10.996]  When Piers Morgan lies and says, I don't want all your guns, when Obama and all the rest of them have been on record saying they want the abolition of civilian ownership of firearms, it makes me mad.
[01:25:11.536 --> 01:25:20.083]  But I know they're following a blueprint of disirement, and then talking to me like I'm stupid, and telling me, oh no, you're just a conspiracy theorist, it makes me angry.
[01:25:20.083 --> 01:25:33.435]  And I see somebody like Ted Nugent, hard-charging, seven days a week, as I follow the media, out there, standing up for liberty, for all of us, knowing if they take the Second Amendment, if they're that bold, they're going to take everything.
[01:25:33.435 --> 01:25:39.460]  To know that Obamacare was written to raise taxes on poor people, and to screw them, and to bring in socialism and death panels.
[01:25:40.552 --> 01:25:43.454]  Thank God Ted Nugent's upset.
[01:25:43.454 --> 01:25:45.995]  And listen, people say, Alex, why are you so upset?
[01:25:45.995 --> 01:25:47.956]  Because I'm tired of playing games.
[01:25:47.956 --> 01:25:49.377]  I'm tired of living in denial.
[01:25:49.377 --> 01:25:50.338]  This is real for me.
[01:25:50.338 --> 01:25:56.241]  It isn't like I'm some libertarian conservative on the air, constitutionalist, because that's a nice niche or something.
[01:25:56.241 --> 01:25:58.042]  It's my business plan, okay?
[01:25:58.042 --> 01:25:59.103]  I believe in liberty.
[01:25:59.103 --> 01:26:00.884]  It's what made America great.
[01:26:00.884 --> 01:26:04.426]  And the fact that there aren't more people like Alex Jones and Ted Nugent is the problem.
[01:26:05.151 --> 01:26:08.120]  You're either on offense or you're getting screwed.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:11.049]  And the tyrants are running wild because they think we're a bunch of sheep.
[01:26:11.883 --> 01:26:12.704]  Okay?
[01:26:12.704 --> 01:26:14.285]  And this country's on the edge of civil war.
[01:26:14.285 --> 01:26:15.646]  A few days ago, I had Ron Paul on.
[01:26:15.646 --> 01:26:18.488]  He said, yes, it'll cause a civil war if they come for the guns.
[01:26:18.488 --> 01:26:19.689]  Folks, it will.
[01:26:19.689 --> 01:26:23.192]  There are a large percentage of gun owners that are ready for war.
[01:26:23.192 --> 01:26:24.153]  I got a family, folks.
[01:26:24.153 --> 01:26:25.654]  I don't want this to happen.
[01:26:25.654 --> 01:26:28.016]  But damn it, I'm not going to back off either.
[01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:33.661]  Ted Nugent, this is a short segment, but on the subject of where this country is going, this isn't Russia or Germany.
[01:26:33.661 --> 01:26:37.724]  The tyrants need to know that the Second Amendment, like a time bomb, has been planted for them.
[01:26:38.004 --> 01:26:47.877]  And the fact that they're going after our Second Amendment has alerted the people of this country and the world, and I want the Marxist scum to know that they're going to lose this fight if they start it.
[01:26:47.877 --> 01:26:50.581]  So what do you say about waking up and being alive?
[01:26:50.581 --> 01:26:55.807]  I know you've been alive and awake forever because of where you came from, but what do you say to those that are in a damn coma?
[01:26:56.328 --> 01:26:59.451]  Well, first of all, the prognosis is improving every day, Alex.
[01:26:59.451 --> 01:27:04.496]  I'm sure you see it from your callers and the people you hang out with, especially here in the great Republic of Texas.
[01:27:04.496 --> 01:27:18.810]  You know, if you've met my kids, my grandkids, my wife, Jermaine, my brothers, my sister, all my hunting buddies, the production team for our tetanus and spirit of the wild, our sunrise safari guides, all the people that we hunt with, and we do all the charity work with all the children's charity.
[01:27:19.110 --> 01:27:32.595]  I'm just working hard, playing hard America, where a few years ago they might have rolled their eyes when I said you shouldn't give up Saturday night specials and that there's no such thing as cop killer bullets and that none of these guns are assault weapons.
[01:27:32.595 --> 01:27:34.816]  They rolled their eyes because they didn't understand.
[01:27:34.816 --> 01:27:36.057]  They were ignorant.
[01:27:36.057 --> 01:27:38.958]  Now all of a sudden they're going, boy, you were right.
[01:27:38.958 --> 01:27:40.258]  You were absolutely right.
[01:27:40.258 --> 01:27:48.802]  I see where this guy got in trouble because his gun had a collapsible stock in New Jersey, or this hero of the military was thrown in prison
[01:27:49.242 --> 01:27:49.402]  Yeah!
[01:28:07.677 --> 01:28:08.638]  Easy to beat.
[01:28:08.638 --> 01:28:14.021]  This guy is too easy to decapitate with his fantasy and his British cult of denial.
[01:28:14.021 --> 01:28:22.007]  All you have to do is like you do and I do and everybody else I've seen lately, though we'll talk about the effectiveness of various individuals in a second.
[01:28:23.187 --> 01:28:39.380]  The evidence is 100% on our side, and if we are aware of that evidence, and we know how to bring it to the argument, bring it to the so-called debate, as you did and as I did, and more and more people are learning to do, you know, we got a hero at the NRA, Chris Cox.
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:45.926]  Wayne LaPierre is getting better all the time when it comes to standing up for what right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed stands for.
[01:28:49.102 --> 01:28:50.843]  Better slowly but surely.
[01:28:50.843 --> 01:29:08.036]  But I think, like we thank God that Piers Morgan was sent down, I think we have to thank God that he sent Barack Obama, because this guy is so... is destined to destroy everything good about America.
[01:29:08.036 --> 01:29:10.398]  His policies, his scams,
[01:29:17.521 --> 01:29:31.727]  Let's come back and talk about that in a long segment coming up.
[01:29:31.727 --> 01:29:33.148]  The one, the only, Ted Nugent.
[01:29:33.148 --> 01:29:34.248]  TedNugent.com.
[01:29:34.248 --> 01:29:39.330]  Get the news, the tur, the bullets, the ammo, everything at TedNugent.com.
[01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:40.631]  I'm jealous of that website.
[01:29:40.631 --> 01:29:41.171]  Man, look at that.
[01:29:41.451 --> 01:29:42.573]  TedNugent.com.
[01:29:42.573 --> 01:29:43.254]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:43.254 --> 01:29:47.279]  I'm Alex Jones with PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[01:29:47.279 --> 01:29:50.103]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.103 --> 01:29:51.485]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.485 --> 01:29:54.029]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.029 --> 01:29:56.692]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:02.501]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:30:02.501 --> 01:30:06.143]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[01:30:06.143 --> 01:30:10.685]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:30:10.685 --> 01:30:16.788]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:30:16.788 --> 01:30:27.614]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[01:30:27.794 --> 01:30:30.657]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!
[01:30:30.657 --> 01:30:34.280]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:51.236]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:30:51.576 --> 01:30:56.908]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 Filters today at infowarestore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:31:04.551 --> 01:31:05.813]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:05.813 --> 01:31:09.697]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:09.697 --> 01:31:11.980]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:17.867]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:17.867 --> 01:31:24.115]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:24.515 --> 01:31:30.459]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:30.459 --> 01:31:34.681]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:31:34.681 --> 01:31:38.964]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:38.964 --> 01:31:44.907]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:44.907 --> 01:31:48.469]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:48.469 --> 01:31:50.431]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:50.431 --> 01:31:50.871]  It's here.
[01:31:51.552 --> 01:31:58.370]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:32:00.717 --> 01:32:02.258]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[01:32:02.258 --> 01:32:04.079]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[01:32:04.079 --> 01:32:06.421]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[01:32:06.421 --> 01:32:08.122]  What can you not live without?
[01:32:08.122 --> 01:32:09.843]  What is your greatest dependency?
[01:32:09.843 --> 01:32:10.824]  Is it your guns?
[01:32:10.824 --> 01:32:11.784]  Is it your home?
[01:32:11.784 --> 01:32:13.205]  No, it's food.
[01:32:13.205 --> 01:32:15.327]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[01:32:15.327 --> 01:32:18.829]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[01:32:18.829 --> 01:32:20.050]  Don't be dependent.
[01:32:20.050 --> 01:32:21.150]  Be self-sufficient.
[01:32:21.150 --> 01:32:22.811]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[01:32:22.811 --> 01:32:23.472]  Feed yourself.
[01:32:23.912 --> 01:32:26.133]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[01:32:26.133 --> 01:32:29.695]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoodsDirect.
[01:32:29.695 --> 01:32:32.436]  It's the best long-term storable food on the planet.

[01:32:53.086 --> 01:32:53.727]  We're good to go.
[01:33:28.348 --> 01:33:29.131]  We're good to go.
[01:33:47.384 --> 01:33:48.725]  Turned down a Ted Nugent song.
[01:33:48.725 --> 01:33:50.046]  Ever been in a car?
[01:33:50.046 --> 01:33:53.469]  Stranglehold, probably one of the greatest, if not the greatest.
[01:33:53.469 --> 01:33:59.974]  Yeah, I gotta ask you, here, before we get back into the news and some really hardcore stuff, how did you come up with Stranglehold?
[01:33:59.974 --> 01:34:04.738]  I mean, were you channeling, you know, the Almighty or something?
[01:34:04.738 --> 01:34:07.660]  I mean, that is, that song is so perfect.
[01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:08.741]  How did you do that, Ted Nugent?
[01:34:10.211 --> 01:34:13.472]  You should see it from where I'm sitting.
[01:34:13.472 --> 01:34:15.673]  I play that lick every night.
[01:34:15.673 --> 01:34:17.093]  My band's too, Alex.
[01:34:17.093 --> 01:34:22.835]  I've got to give a big salute to the greasiest, blackest gods of thunder in the world.
[01:34:22.835 --> 01:34:26.836]  Mick Brown on drums, Greg Smith on bass guitar, and Derek St.
[01:34:26.836 --> 01:34:28.257]  Holmes on vocals and guitar.
[01:34:28.257 --> 01:34:32.198]  I have every guitar player's dream, every concert,
[01:34:32.538 --> 01:34:33.639]  We're good to go.
[01:34:47.671 --> 01:34:48.311]  We're good to go.
[01:35:15.606 --> 01:35:16.427]  We're good to go.
[01:35:36.781 --> 01:35:48.185]  Defiance against slavery, defiance against oppression, defiance against your own black people shackling you and selling you as a slave.
[01:35:48.185 --> 01:35:52.226]  That's where that unbelievable James Brown work ethic came from.
[01:35:57.739 --> 01:35:58.079]  I don't know.
[01:36:14.915 --> 01:36:20.441]  And by the way, you mentioned this to me earlier, but I just punched it in, black power Ted Nugent.
[01:36:20.441 --> 01:36:22.364]  The media is freaking out.
[01:36:22.364 --> 01:36:27.569]  You've been saying this for 40-something years, that this is what inspires you, your band, all of it.
[01:36:27.569 --> 01:36:32.555]  But the so-called left, the tyrants, who say you don't like socialism, don't like gun control, it's racism.
[01:36:33.496 --> 01:36:36.017]  No connection to reality, not even any facts.
[01:36:36.017 --> 01:36:37.778]  They just throw the word out there.
[01:36:37.778 --> 01:36:39.138]  They're the real race pimps.
[01:36:39.138 --> 01:36:43.500]  Margaret Sanger saying we've got to become liberals and take over to abort the black babies.
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:47.781]  What do you say to the media freaking out over your black power 2013?
[01:36:47.781 --> 01:36:52.443]  I mean, from my research, the so-called left are really...
[01:36:53.323 --> 01:36:59.665]  The proto-Nazis, the left in America and England, created the eugenics that Hitler picked up.
[01:36:59.665 --> 01:37:04.087]  The truth is they claim that they're the anti-racist because they're the racist.
[01:37:04.087 --> 01:37:08.368]  Well, I think the biggest racist in the world would either be President Obama.
[01:37:08.368 --> 01:37:11.330]  I mean, when you say Trayvon Martin could have been my son.
[01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:15.771]  Well, with all due respect, Mr. President, Brian Terry could have been my son.
[01:37:15.771 --> 01:37:19.352]  And your Eric Holder sold the guns to the gangs that killed him.
[01:37:19.352 --> 01:37:20.393]  Try that on for size.
[01:37:21.093 --> 01:37:22.474]  It's incredible, and then...
[01:37:42.475 --> 01:37:46.820]  And then you can't even have a tour paying homage to your music roots.
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:49.002]  It just shows how sick these people are.
[01:37:49.002 --> 01:37:51.765]  They never want people to really come together under freedom.
[01:37:51.765 --> 01:37:56.169]  Now expanding on this, you mentioned the fact that the NRA is getting on the offense.
[01:37:56.169 --> 01:38:00.173]  When we have the memos that they want to confiscate our guns, when it's on record,
[01:38:01.014 --> 01:38:12.059]  You use the truth to defeat them, and during the break we were talking, you know, you described it as Republicans are more worried about adjusting their tie than actually, you know, being patriots.
[01:38:12.059 --> 01:38:13.040]  Expand on that.
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:16.942]  I mean, look, it's time to stop debating all their fake arguments about the children.
[01:38:16.942 --> 01:38:23.745]  They want our guns because they want a monopoly of power, and I think that's the key to the offense is pointing that out.
[01:38:23.745 --> 01:38:29.868]  Well, when I criticize the failures of the GOP, only the guilty need to feel guilty.
[01:38:30.649 --> 01:38:36.932]  We have some incredible leaders in this country right now, especially, which is why I'm a Texan.
[01:38:36.932 --> 01:38:53.139]  I came to Texas ten years ago because the wonderful, glorious work epicenter of Detroit that I grew up in turned into the hell zone of pimps, whores, and welfare brats because of liberal Democrats like Mayor Coleman Young and Mayor Kwame Kirkpatrick and Jennifer Granholm.
[01:38:53.139 --> 01:38:56.361]  So I came to Texas where we have genuine statesmen
[01:38:56.841 --> 01:39:00.303]  Genuine patriots who understand they serve we, the people, and the U.S.
[01:39:00.303 --> 01:39:01.343]  Constitution.
[01:39:01.343 --> 01:39:04.145]  Governor Perry is the best governor in America.
[01:39:04.145 --> 01:39:06.986]  Greg Abbott is the best Attorney General in America.
[01:39:06.986 --> 01:39:11.028]  Ron Paul, Ted Cruz, John Conan.
[01:39:11.028 --> 01:39:15.790]  There's so many great, great constitutional representatives here in Texas.
[01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:17.351]  And John Stone in South Dakota.
[01:39:17.351 --> 01:39:18.992]  Mike Rogers up in Michigan.
[01:39:18.992 --> 01:39:22.434]  Even Scott Walker now in Wisconsin.
[01:39:22.434 --> 01:39:25.355]  We see an improvement, a return to the
[01:39:25.875 --> 01:39:27.876]  Exactly, so let me ask you this.
[01:39:42.868 --> 01:39:57.415]  So many people who set their alarm clocks and bust their ass to be the best that they can be, they work, they work, they make ends meet, they save for a rainy day, they demand accountability and productivity by their sons and everybody in their family.
[01:39:57.415 --> 01:39:59.336]  That's how the Nugent family operates.
[01:39:59.336 --> 01:40:01.638]  That's how the Alex Jones family operates.
[01:40:01.638 --> 01:40:04.519]  But a lot of those people don't vote.
[01:40:04.519 --> 01:40:06.300]  A lot of those people don't communicate.
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:08.521]  They don't even know who their senator or their congressman is.
[01:40:08.961 --> 01:40:13.123]  So we the people who want upgrade and a return to a U.S.
[01:40:13.123 --> 01:40:18.045]  constitutionally driven America, we have got to communicate with our elected officials.
[01:40:18.045 --> 01:40:27.409]  Because some of the elected officials that I just named by name, there are some of those in every state, even California, New Jersey, and New York, and Illinois.
[01:40:27.409 --> 01:40:31.510]  They got these people, but they don't hear from us.
[01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:38.373]  So until you are an actual participant in the Sacred Experiment self-government, I'd like to thank you for nothing.
[01:40:39.372 --> 01:40:40.332]  I agree with you.
[01:40:40.332 --> 01:40:43.254]  And look at the areas like Chicago and L.A.
[01:40:43.254 --> 01:40:48.236]  and the areas that these authoritarians that call themselves liberals are in control.
[01:40:48.236 --> 01:40:56.719]  They bankrupt and destroy every city, every county, every state, every country they run because they are con-arnest criminals.
[01:40:56.719 --> 01:41:01.321]  And again, it's time for us to stop apologizing about the fact that we're right.
[01:41:01.321 --> 01:41:03.962]  It's time for us to stand up and call these crooks out.
[01:41:04.602 --> 01:41:13.929]  And that's why they say, oh, you're discredited yelling at Piers Morgan or Ted Nugent, you know, you know, told him get off people's backs and shut the hell up.
[01:41:13.929 --> 01:41:16.591]  And, you know, that you're basically full of crap.
[01:41:16.591 --> 01:41:18.112]  Oh, Ted's discredited.
[01:41:18.112 --> 01:41:22.295]  No, we're the only people waking people up out of their coma.
[01:41:22.295 --> 01:41:29.140]  And the fact that the so-called left is saying, don't get angry, that shows they're scared of us getting angry.
[01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:30.381]  Absolutely.
[01:41:30.381 --> 01:41:41.169]  And you've got to admit, Alex, I wish I could name all of them, but everybody's got a different role, and everybody's got a different style and a different approach.
[01:41:41.169 --> 01:41:54.819]  But you really have to hand it to, whether you like it or not, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and so many of these guys out there, and Laura Ingram, and Monica Crowley.
[01:41:54.819 --> 01:41:58.262]  I mean, so many of our side now have more and more of a voice.
[01:41:58.622 --> 01:42:08.770]  And they are wielding the crowbar more than just the sweetie pie attitude that has opened the door for the tyrants to crush us to this degree.
[01:42:08.770 --> 01:42:10.612]  So yes, it's time to get tough.
[01:42:10.612 --> 01:42:17.917]  It doesn't mean you have to start punching or shooting, but you have to escalate the debate so that the enemy can't control things.
[01:42:17.917 --> 01:42:20.940]  I've been in every media, I do media every day.
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:33.646]  And anybody that has ever messed with me has lost, because I have all the evidence to support what I stand for, because I stand for the self-evident truth, and being the best that you can be.
[01:42:33.646 --> 01:42:41.649]  And if you want to find out where Obama is taking America, check out his home gangster acorn hell of Chicago.
[01:42:41.649 --> 01:42:44.591]  Chicago has been run by Democrats forever.
[01:42:44.591 --> 01:42:49.753]  They're either all in prison, or they're encouraging the shooting of their citizens.
[01:42:50.633 --> 01:42:59.658]  They have a gun-free zone where more innocent lives are lost every day than in any high-carrying, concealed-weapon jurisdiction in this country.
[01:42:59.658 --> 01:43:01.439]  And they won't admit it.
[01:43:01.439 --> 01:43:10.404]  They keep doing the same thing, claiming they want different results that is not only disingenuous, that is rotten to the core.
[01:43:10.404 --> 01:43:15.147]  They hate freedom, and they love abuse of power.
[01:43:16.209 --> 01:43:19.650]  They do, and that's why they're scared of us waking up out of our coma.
[01:43:19.650 --> 01:43:20.670]  Ted Nugent joins us.
[01:43:20.670 --> 01:43:23.210]  TedNugent.com if you're just now tuning in again.
[01:43:23.210 --> 01:43:25.551]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[01:43:25.551 --> 01:43:32.853]  Ted, where do you think America will be if people don't stand up and don't take action, which is starting to happen.
[01:43:32.853 --> 01:43:39.754]  But if people don't stand up and really get in the face of this tyranny and back it off, because by getting aggressive politically,
[01:43:40.094 --> 01:43:43.396]  Well, the First Amendment, we won't have to use the second.
[01:43:43.396 --> 01:43:45.237]  But what is your concern?
[01:43:45.237 --> 01:43:50.320]  Because, again, as I said earlier, I had Ron Paul on a few days ago, and he's concerned about civil war.
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:44:04.109]  It appears to a lot of sociologists and people that study this that the leftists want to start some type of conflict and then brand the patriots, as the homeland security documents under Obama's state, that al-Qaeda is not the threat.
[01:44:04.109 --> 01:44:06.891]  Now it's gun owners, conservatives, returning veterans.
[01:44:06.891 --> 01:44:08.432]  They're clearly trying to brand it.
[01:44:09.192 --> 01:44:19.816]  A article came out yesterday where Homeland Security is buying drones and in the training video they're going around looking for people selling guns to their neighbors.
[01:44:19.816 --> 01:44:24.277]  So we see that the Patriot American is the new target of Homeland Security.
[01:44:24.277 --> 01:44:29.779]  What can you say about that and how it segues into some of the persecution you've gone through?
[01:44:29.779 --> 01:44:32.240]  Tell us what's been happening to you the last few months.
[01:44:33.936 --> 01:44:35.317]  So many issues there.
[01:44:35.317 --> 01:44:43.064]  Number one, thank you for bringing these things up, because now people can Google and they go to your website, and if you go to tedneuton.com, I would welcome you.
[01:44:43.064 --> 01:44:46.927]  I would love to have you be part of our tedneuton.com talkback.
[01:44:46.927 --> 01:44:49.089]  We have some hardcore gung-ho
[01:44:49.990 --> 01:45:14.251]  Great American families on my talk back on my website and we get all this latest update to and we make sure that we review We got people inside the deepest security in the United States government that are on my talk back We have friends at most federal agencies and at every department of every political activity in every state and we're looking with a genuine spirit and
[01:45:14.551 --> 01:45:15.151]  Of course.
[01:45:34.264 --> 01:45:35.425]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:46:03.926 --> 01:46:04.366]  Really?
[01:46:04.366 --> 01:46:05.467]  Really?
[01:46:05.467 --> 01:46:07.909]  It's so naive!
[01:46:07.909 --> 01:46:17.254]  That kind of brain dead soullessness has horribly taken place and taken root and metastasized here in America.
[01:46:17.254 --> 01:46:29.181]  So I know about the drones, I know about the militarization of law enforcement, but I'm not going to guess what might happen if Obama's dream of tyranny comes true.
[01:46:29.181 --> 01:46:31.543]  I believe that more and more people are waking up
[01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:49.235]  I believe that more and more people are communicating these serious issues about accountability and what happened in Benghazi and Fast and Furious, the crime of Obamacare, the abuse of power and the corruption, the absolute proven lies of every word out of this president's mouth.
[01:46:49.755 --> 01:46:50.035]  I think?
[01:47:08.564 --> 01:47:10.645]  That's how we're going to do it.
[01:47:31.786 --> 01:47:34.269]  Well listen, I'm not bragging about this.
[01:47:34.269 --> 01:47:37.753]  What I tell these stories is because it's important for people to know.
[01:47:37.753 --> 01:47:43.900]  I can now go anywhere in the country and can't walk 10 feet down a street without listeners stopping.
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:48.225]  And I'm just, you know, a little guy in all this over the years.
[01:47:48.225 --> 01:47:50.387]  And I went to a restaurant in Wemberley, Texas
[01:47:51.940 --> 01:48:01.706]  Saturday and there were only about 10 tables and almost every table came over and wanted photos and we're listeners and I know you get the same response.
[01:48:01.706 --> 01:48:02.987]  That's what you're saying.
[01:48:02.987 --> 01:48:07.889]  It's exponential how many people are awake of every race, color and creed.
[01:48:07.889 --> 01:48:13.193]  It's exciting and I think the key to all this is saying look they want our guns to enslave us.
[01:48:13.193 --> 01:48:14.613]  They're liars.
[01:48:14.613 --> 01:48:16.815]  They're tyrants just calling it like it is.
[01:48:16.815 --> 01:48:20.077]  People are so hungry for that and if we just go past
[01:48:21.064 --> 01:48:25.607]  The hoax that, oh, we're supposed to stand down and compromise.
[01:48:25.607 --> 01:48:27.488]  The other side never gives in.
[01:48:27.488 --> 01:48:28.969]  They just tell us to compromise.
[01:48:28.969 --> 01:48:30.169]  Then, as you said, we bend over.
[01:48:30.169 --> 01:48:31.510]  But let's talk about this.
[01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:34.572]  I talked to you off air when you called in on the Sunday show.
[01:48:34.572 --> 01:48:37.854]  You said, oh, man, next time I come on, I'll tell you about the crap I've been going through.
[01:48:37.854 --> 01:48:43.257]  I think it's important to talk about how they spun what you said and some of the things you.
[01:48:43.837 --> 01:49:03.266]  You know, that have happened to you and how they're trying to go after you because if they can take down Ted Nugent, somebody who's actually alive, whose heart is beating, and if they can demonize that, if we don't stand behind Ted Nugent, even if people don't 100% agree with you out there, they've got to stand behind you in the First Amendment because if they can take you down, kind of the guy up there on the point...
[01:49:03.906 --> 01:49:13.990]  I mean, look, look, Second Amendment, you think of Ted Nugent and George Washington, and then down the road, maybe Alex Jones and Ron Paul and the NRA, but I mean, let's say it, you're Mr. Second Amendment.
[01:49:13.990 --> 01:49:18.332]  I mean, buddy, I know you got the Second Amendment, but I hope you got bodyguards.
[01:49:18.332 --> 01:49:20.513]  You really are front and center.
[01:49:20.513 --> 01:49:21.373]  Have you realized that?
[01:49:22.554 --> 01:49:23.174]  Yes, I have.
[01:49:23.174 --> 01:49:32.878]  Over the years, I realized that when it comes to absolutely defining the God-given right to keep and bear arms, I've been on the forefront forever.
[01:49:32.878 --> 01:49:41.481]  And now people are realizing that the reason I'm considered an extremist and a zealot is because the concept of having a free people was very extreme in 1775.
[01:49:41.481 --> 01:49:44.482]  Yeah, the system demonizes the founders.
[01:49:44.482 --> 01:49:46.062]  Yeah.
[01:49:46.062 --> 01:49:47.323]  The system demonizes the founders.
[01:49:47.323 --> 01:49:50.163]  So I'm saying, you're Mr. Second Amendment.
[01:49:50.163 --> 01:49:51.304]  Tell us about the persecution.
[01:49:52.082 --> 01:49:54.444]  Well, you know, I've been a hunter my whole life.
[01:49:54.444 --> 01:49:56.286]  My dad raised me to be law-abiding.
[01:49:56.286 --> 01:50:00.289]  I've been a sheriff's deputy for over 34 years now.
[01:50:00.289 --> 01:50:07.015]  I conduct federal raids here in Texas with the FBI, the ATF, the DEA, the Texas Rangers, the federal marshals.
[01:50:07.015 --> 01:50:11.699]  I've been very active, hands-on, in law enforcement for over 30 years now.
[01:50:12.639 --> 01:50:20.605]  My point being is that you don't become a sheriff's deputy, you're not invited on federal, you know, fugitive felony raids if you're a questionable guy.
[01:50:20.605 --> 01:50:26.729]  You have to prove yourself, and I proved myself during my training, and I've proven myself during these raids.
[01:50:26.729 --> 01:50:31.253]  Well, I'm solidly in the asset column, but I've always been a legal hunter.
[01:50:31.253 --> 01:50:33.474]  My dad said, you don't dare break a law.
[01:50:33.474 --> 01:50:36.076]  I've never hunted out of season with the wrong weapon.
[01:50:36.076 --> 01:50:41.440]  I've always bought every tag and every license and every permit and really watched my P's and Q's.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:51.723]  Well, a number of years ago, I was hunting in California, and our Ted Nugent Spirit of the Wild show on Outdoor Channel has been the number one show, outdoor hunting show, for over 26 years now.
[01:50:51.723 --> 01:50:55.264]  Every year, we become the viewer's favorite, because I do it honestly.
[01:50:55.264 --> 01:51:00.426]  I do it documentary style, real down-to-earth, natural, organic, killing-your-own-food.
[01:51:00.426 --> 01:51:03.207]  I don't play games, and I don't apologize.
[01:51:03.207 --> 01:51:04.527]  Well, the U.S.
[01:51:04.527 --> 01:51:07.428]  Fish and Wildlife Service has been so infested
[01:51:07.955 --> 01:51:19.357]  With anti-hunting, anti-wildlife, anti-Ted Nugent idiots, that in California, hunting an apple orchard on our TV show on Spirit of the Wild, we showed it on the air!
[01:51:19.357 --> 01:51:26.759]  I had bought my licenses and double-checked all the legalities with the director of California Fish and Game, James Pong.
[01:51:26.759 --> 01:51:30.620]  Long story short, after the show aired, U.S.
[01:51:30.620 --> 01:51:34.721]  Fish and Wildlife jackbooted thugs, subhuman punks,
[01:51:37.316 --> 01:51:54.250]  I had a 36-man, guns-drawn, pre-dawn raid on my three hunting buddies' homes in California based on the allegation equal to a jaywalking ticket that I was hunting over bait.
[01:51:54.250 --> 01:52:00.335]  Alex, they kicked down doors, they confiscated guns and bows and video cameras and telephones
[01:52:07.771 --> 01:52:11.167]  100% law-abiding, never broke a law in their lives.
[01:52:12.586 --> 01:52:13.086]  We're good to go.
[01:52:41.732 --> 01:52:42.193]  We're good to go.
[01:52:55.188 --> 01:53:09.116]  It just shows what crazy authoritarians they are and how they use regulations to harass people but then exempt themselves when Obama's given a half billion dollars to his buddies to a fake energy company.
[01:53:09.116 --> 01:53:18.061]  It is so amazing to watch China build three new coal power plants a week but we're having them shut down when they're clean burning.
[01:53:18.061 --> 01:53:21.883]  They want this country bankrupted to make us dependent
[01:53:22.783 --> 01:53:30.150]  On them, and you know, even on our little ranch in East Texas, we've been hunting out there and
[01:53:32.182 --> 01:53:36.906]  This is a county where, you know, my grandfather was the tax assessor and stuff.
[01:53:36.906 --> 01:53:45.673]  And now, oh, we're, you know, we're here to search everything you're doing here on your ranch because you've got hunters out here under a federal grant.
[01:53:45.673 --> 01:53:51.038]  And we found out they were harassing people everywhere, old families who have no criminal records.
[01:53:51.038 --> 01:53:55.101]  And it's all about government basically pissing on us to let us know, hey,
[01:53:55.922 --> 01:54:03.220]  You're a criminal, government is God, and it just really lights a fire under my butt to just fight that much harder.
[01:54:04.031 --> 01:54:07.013]  And let me tell you, I've got some great friends in U.S.
[01:54:07.013 --> 01:54:14.058]  Fish and Wildlife, and I'm not saying friends because, you know, I'm a schmooze with them, it's because we are dedicated to conservation.
[01:54:14.058 --> 01:54:28.609]  So I salute the genuine and law-abiding federal agents of every agency out there, but I hope the ones that are guilty are pissed off when they hear me talk about that, because if you're angry at what I'm saying, that would be guilt, because they're
[01:54:30.171 --> 01:54:39.359]  Well, the SWAT team raid is meant to chill and intimidate everybody into lying about you to throw Ted Nugent in jail.
[01:54:39.359 --> 01:54:43.102]  Because if they can get Ted Nugent, they can get everybody else after that.
[01:54:43.102 --> 01:54:44.644]  And they tried it with my buddies.
[01:54:44.644 --> 01:54:45.985]  They actually reached it.
[01:54:45.985 --> 01:54:46.925]  Well, here's the clincher.
[01:54:46.925 --> 01:54:51.830]  These subhuman punks, jackbooted punks, kicked down the wrong door.
[01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:57.655]  And I don't know if you know anything about search warrants, but I've actually participated in a number of search warrants as the searcher.
[01:54:58.675 --> 01:55:02.417]  You've got to have every description of that domicile.
[01:55:02.417 --> 01:55:05.158]  You've got to have the color of brick.
[01:55:05.158 --> 01:55:06.958]  You have to have the color of the side.
[01:55:06.958 --> 01:55:10.340]  You have to have the street numbers and how big and which way they face.
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:12.421]  You have to identify neighbors' homes.
[01:55:12.421 --> 01:55:15.742]  Well, these subhuman punks kicked down the wrong...
[01:55:23.285 --> 01:55:25.527]  Probably the only person who hadn't.
[01:55:25.527 --> 01:55:31.933]  Again, this is what's so crazy about it, is that they just continue to get crazier and crazier.
[01:55:31.933 --> 01:55:39.039]  Just like, when you read the Declaration of Independence, Ted Nugent, is it not like a mirror of what we're seeing unfold now?
[01:55:39.039 --> 01:55:39.740]  Absolutely.
[01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:41.561]  And I've said it over and over again.
[01:55:41.561 --> 01:55:44.444]  The Declaration of Independence, the U.S.
[01:55:44.444 --> 01:55:46.686]  Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[01:55:46.686 --> 01:55:50.149]  If I was dropped here naked in the year four,
[01:55:51.315 --> 01:56:00.059]  I could have written down all those points, even not being the victim of tyranny and oppression.
[01:56:00.059 --> 01:56:01.700]  I know what freedom is.
[01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:10.465]  It's how God designed us to be self-sufficient, rugged individualism, to pursue our individual dreams, to be an asset to the people around us.
[01:56:13.564 --> 01:56:13.924]  I'm good.
[01:56:38.328 --> 01:56:43.491]  And they try to demonize you for that, but that's self-evident right to not be a slave.
[01:56:43.491 --> 01:56:47.152]  All the Bill of Rights and Constitution does is point out what's already there.
[01:56:47.152 --> 01:56:51.855]  And I loved how they tried to spin, you know, what you said about Obama.
[01:56:51.855 --> 01:56:55.516]  Do you have any comments on that?
[01:56:55.516 --> 01:56:59.659]  You know, are you talking about the time my friends from the Secret Service came and visited me?
[01:56:59.659 --> 01:57:02.780]  Yes.
[01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:04.561]  You don't think I'm having any fun here, do you?
[01:57:07.731 --> 01:57:08.733]  But I get such a kick out of the media.
[01:57:16.579 --> 01:57:26.024]  Just doing somersaults in their own excrement, trying to attribute quotes to me that never came out of my mouth.
[01:57:26.024 --> 01:57:37.671]  And nowadays, of course, everything is on film and there's recorded records of everything that comes out of my mouth, yet they still lie through their teeth.
[01:57:37.671 --> 01:57:41.913]  So, it was a pleasant experience, but again, if you're going to take on
[01:57:43.737 --> 01:57:51.934]  You have got to be prepared for the devil's gang to misrepresent, to lie, to obfuscate,
[01:57:54.042 --> 01:57:59.286]  Let's go crazy trying to attribute something to you that never took place.
[01:57:59.286 --> 01:58:02.188]  Well, I can tell you about my experience with the Secret Service.
[01:58:02.188 --> 01:58:07.111]  Number one, I trained with them here in Texas, and I trained with them around the country.
[01:58:07.111 --> 01:58:14.736]  They're actually part of President Bush's personal counter-assault team, and they trained on my ranch up here near Waco, Texas.
[01:58:14.736 --> 01:58:17.899]  So I knew these guys, and they knew what I was made out of.
[01:58:17.899 --> 01:58:19.600]  And let me tell you what the bottom line is.
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:29.705]  The Secret Service having to waste their time investigating Ted Law biting assets of your fellow man, America.
[01:58:29.705 --> 01:58:32.927]  They were absolutely ashamed of themselves.
[01:58:32.927 --> 01:58:39.570]  But they had to do it because Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein and Sheila Jackson Lee... Hold on one more second.
[01:58:39.570 --> 01:58:41.512]  We're going to do five more minutes.
[01:58:41.512 --> 01:58:44.973]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.973 --> 01:58:47.195]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.593 --> 01:58:57.429]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[01:58:58.354 --> 01:59:05.098]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[01:59:05.098 --> 01:59:16.043]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce Nano-Silver solutions, our 2-ounce Nano-Silver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.
[01:59:16.043 --> 01:59:20.185]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[01:59:20.185 --> 01:59:26.389]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:38.359]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:59:53.806 --> 01:59:56.209]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.209 --> 01:59:58.993]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:18.239 --> 02:00:24.125]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, the system tries to create a stereotype of myself, Ted Nugent, and others.
[02:00:24.125 --> 02:00:25.367]  We're people that don't want to be slaves.
[02:00:25.367 --> 02:00:26.888]  I mean, I take it real personal.
[02:00:28.066 --> 02:00:35.049]  When an authoritarian government tries to take over from an instinctual level, a survival instinct, but also historically studying it.
[02:00:35.049 --> 02:00:41.272]  Got five minutes left in overdrive here on this Thursday edition with Ted Nugent.
[02:00:41.272 --> 02:00:52.917]  And Ted, finishing up your Secret Service story, you got up to the point of when the Secret Service had to visit you when the media misconstrued what you'd said last year, what happened?
[02:00:54.659 --> 02:00:58.820]  They didn't misconstrue, they intentionally lied about what I said.
[02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:05.062]  And I had a meeting with what I can only describe as the consummate professionals.
[02:01:05.062 --> 02:01:07.562]  These are men and women of the Secret Service.
[02:01:07.562 --> 02:01:20.125]  The vast majority of them are absolute dedicated warriors that are standing up for we the people that are enforcing our laws and that live true to their sacred
[02:01:20.405 --> 02:01:21.106]  I think?
[02:01:36.107 --> 02:01:53.500]  They had to check off the boxes because Sheila Jackson Lee and President Obama and Eric Gunrunning Holder and all his communists and Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein and all these maniacs, they hate me so much that they forced the Secret Service to investigate me.
[02:01:53.940 --> 02:02:09.629]  And at the end of the meeting, they said, well, we understand now, Mr. Nugent, we appreciate your time and your professionalism and your courteousness, and we realize now that there is no threat against anybody, that you did not threaten the President, and we apologize for wasting your damn time.
[02:02:11.517 --> 02:02:15.902]  Absolutely, which is saying the President wasted their time in a very professional way.
[02:02:15.902 --> 02:02:18.244]  In closing, I just want to say this.
[02:02:18.244 --> 02:02:25.992]  I think, and I want your take on it, that it's backfired that they're going after the Second Amendment because you know you don't need it till they come after it.
[02:02:25.992 --> 02:02:27.153]  And again, that's a self-evident
[02:02:27.754 --> 02:02:31.497]  That's a self-evident statement there.
[02:02:31.497 --> 02:02:38.983]  But I really think this is the beginning of the end because they know the Second Amendment is a beachhead of the Republic.
[02:02:38.983 --> 02:02:40.264]  It's what the country was founded on.
[02:02:40.264 --> 02:02:43.687]  And on that, the right to defend yourself, everything else is built on.
[02:02:43.687 --> 02:02:48.471]  And that's why they're trying to kill it and knocking TV shows off Discovery and
[02:02:49.111 --> 02:03:00.515]  You know, trying to have a purge and saying it's like porn or we've got to brainwash people is because the system knows that that's why 99% of cops in major polls are pro-gun.
[02:03:00.515 --> 02:03:02.036]  The Secret Service is pro-gun.
[02:03:02.036 --> 02:03:05.777]  Once you've used guns, once you've been around it, you understand it.
[02:03:05.777 --> 02:03:07.558]  And it's literally like a religion.
[02:03:08.138 --> 02:03:12.580]  We've just got to take people out and teach them safety, teach them history, get them into guns.
[02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:13.381]  It's over.
[02:03:13.381 --> 02:03:21.065]  I see liberals everywhere buying guns the last four or five years, and I think this desperate offensive against the Second Amendment is the death throes of these people.
[02:03:21.065 --> 02:03:23.006]  Final comments on that subject, Ted Nugent.
[02:03:23.479 --> 02:03:32.291]  Bottom line, I think everybody with a conscience and an ounce of sense realizes that unarmed and helpless is an irresponsible condition.
[02:03:32.291 --> 02:03:39.160]  And you should avoid at every opportunity with all intellectual responsibility to never be unarmed and helpless.
[02:03:40.982 --> 02:03:51.667]  The worst condition of unarmed helplessness is when tyrants and dictators and slave drivers and tyrants force the citizens into unarmed helplessness.
[02:03:51.667 --> 02:03:57.390]  Because Barack Obama and Eric Holder and all the leftists, they have their dream.
[02:03:57.390 --> 02:03:58.650]  It's called Chicago.
[02:03:58.650 --> 02:04:00.791]  It's a gun-free zone.
[02:04:00.791 --> 02:04:06.514]  You have to have the same state-issued paperwork you have to have in Havana, Cuba.
[02:04:06.994 --> 02:04:07.675]  We're good to go.
[02:04:28.397 --> 02:04:31.721]  Give away membership to the National Rifle Association.
[02:04:31.721 --> 02:04:34.344]  Join your state firearms organization.
[02:04:34.344 --> 02:04:43.174]  Let your elected officials know that you know that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed is what they took a vow to support.
[02:04:43.394 --> 02:04:44.175]  Absolutely.
[02:04:44.175 --> 02:04:46.198]  And if they don't like it, get out of America.
[02:04:46.198 --> 02:04:46.779]  Ted Nugent.
[02:04:46.779 --> 02:04:48.321]  This has been our best interview ever.
[02:04:48.321 --> 02:04:49.322]  TedNugent.com.
[02:04:49.322 --> 02:04:51.485]  Look forward to having you back again as soon as you can.
[02:04:51.485 --> 02:04:53.548]  The Black Power Tour starts now.
[02:04:53.548 --> 02:04:54.670]  TedNugent.com.
[02:04:54.670 --> 02:04:56.993]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[02:04:56.993 --> 02:04:57.874]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:57.874 --> 02:04:58.295]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.309 --> 02:05:08.331]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[02:05:08.331 --> 02:05:12.953]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.
[02:05:12.953 --> 02:05:23.756]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary, broad-spectrum, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal solution that can be used inside the body as well as on the skin.
[02:05:23.756 --> 02:05:29.018]  Supernatural Silver is unique and superior to colloidal and ionic silvers.
[02:05:29.238 --> 02:05:37.684]  Using a patented technology that is highly effective against colds, flus, infections, food poisoning, and yeast, in addition to many other pathogens.
[02:05:37.684 --> 02:05:46.551]  Supernatural Silver is scientifically supported, extremely safe, and is the number one choice of thousands of people for immune system support.
[02:05:46.551 --> 02:05:50.214]  Find out how Supernatural Silver could change your life.

[02:06:04.399 --> 02:06:10.440]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:14.321]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[02:06:14.321 --> 02:06:15.921]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[02:06:15.921 --> 02:06:19.702]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.
[02:06:20.362 --> 02:06:23.085]  Go to GetSimplySafe.com.
[02:06:23.085 --> 02:06:25.827]  Simply Safe is independent and off the grid.
[02:06:25.827 --> 02:06:30.171]  It runs on battery power, so even if the grid goes down, you're protected.
[02:06:30.171 --> 02:06:36.837]  It's completely customizable, so you can use it in your home, business, boat, trailer, storage unit, or shed.
[02:06:36.837 --> 02:06:38.358]  GetSimplySafe.com.
[02:06:39.159 --> 02:06:43.821]  SimplySafe is also ridiculously easy to install yourself in under 20 minutes.
[02:06:43.821 --> 02:06:46.542]  So there's no need to let a stranger into your home.
[02:06:46.542 --> 02:06:50.623]  If you move or need to relocate, you can take the system with you wherever you go.
[02:06:50.623 --> 02:06:57.646]  You aren't always at home, but SimplySafe will stand guard, protecting your property 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[02:06:57.646 --> 02:06:59.807]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com
[02:07:00.990 --> 02:07:02.550]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[02:07:02.550 --> 02:07:04.351]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[02:07:04.351 --> 02:07:06.691]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[02:07:06.691 --> 02:07:08.412]  What can you not live without?
[02:07:08.412 --> 02:07:10.132]  What is your greatest dependency?
[02:07:10.132 --> 02:07:11.113]  Is it your guns?
[02:07:11.113 --> 02:07:12.053]  Is it your home?
[02:07:12.053 --> 02:07:13.473]  No, it's food.
[02:07:13.473 --> 02:07:15.594]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[02:07:15.594 --> 02:07:19.095]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[02:07:19.095 --> 02:07:20.335]  Don't be dependent.
[02:07:20.335 --> 02:07:21.415]  Be self-sufficient.
[02:07:21.415 --> 02:07:23.076]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[02:07:23.076 --> 02:07:23.736]  Feed yourself.
[02:07:24.196 --> 02:07:26.418]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[02:07:26.418 --> 02:07:29.980]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoodsDirect.
[02:07:29.980 --> 02:07:32.722]  It's the best long-term storable food on the planet.
[02:07:32.722 --> 02:07:35.083]  Get the popular Mega Patriot Pack free.
[02:07:35.083 --> 02:07:38.706]  A 24-day supply of food plus stove, cook pot, and fuel.

[02:07:47.692 --> 02:07:51.894]  Build your food supply, be in control, be self-sufficient, and be a patriot.
[02:07:52.895 --> 02:07:56.016]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:07:56.016 --> 02:07:57.876]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:08:17.043 --> 02:08:26.057]  I've been interviewed by and had a lot of really amazing people on last week from Ted Nugent to Michael Savage to Howard Stern of all people.
[02:08:26.057 --> 02:08:26.918]  I was on his show.
[02:08:26.918 --> 02:08:32.486]  We're certainly breaking out, reaching new audiences and that's what's important to wake people up to what's happening.
[02:08:33.027 --> 02:08:39.568]  And the reception across the board is good, because the establishment is getting so overtly crazy.
[02:08:39.568 --> 02:08:47.850]  Not just Obama, but the Republicans as well have been critical, obviously, of the one-party monopoly that masquerades with its two heads.
[02:08:47.850 --> 02:08:53.491]  But Gerald Solente of TheTrendsJournal.com is, again, probably the most popular guest we have on.
[02:08:53.491 --> 02:08:56.712]  I know, I always enjoy his wit and humor, and also his
[02:08:57.372 --> 02:09:08.240]  Piercing intellect into what he sees in trends developing and we also over the years have broken down trends that we see developing mainly from what MIT and DARPA and the globalists say they're going to do.
[02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:11.682]  I don't have to even look into the future on things historically.
[02:09:11.682 --> 02:09:15.905]  They pretty much tell us what they're going to try to do but not everything turns out the way they want.
[02:09:15.905 --> 02:09:16.786]  It doesn't matter.
[02:09:16.786 --> 02:09:18.888]  They're in control so they just regroup and move forward.
[02:09:19.528 --> 02:09:23.590]  The Globalist, according to Brzezinski and others, and I concur, are about 10 years behind.
[02:09:23.590 --> 02:09:26.112]  So we are in the fight, but it's very serious.
[02:09:26.112 --> 02:09:40.359]  Now, I've got a host of subjects I want to get into with Gerald Solente here today concerning Bernanke, what's happening in Europe, the global meltdown, the fact that the bond market is this huge bubble, a new housing bubble.
[02:09:40.359 --> 02:09:48.944]  We're going to get into all of these points with Gerald Solente and some new nuances to major trends that he's been accurately predicting.
[02:09:50.421 --> 02:09:58.585]  But I wanted to just raise this clip first with Gerald, and get his take on it, working in government, working as a consultant, and things like that.
[02:09:58.585 --> 02:10:09.772]  He's talked about this some in the past, because I've studied history, I've studied the modern elites, the white shoeboys as he calls them, and the prostitutes that regurgitate things for him, but now I'm seeing levels of regurgitation.
[02:10:10.692 --> 02:10:11.853]  That I've never seen.
[02:10:11.853 --> 02:10:20.376]  I mean, it's like two or three times worse, where Gibbs gets up and says, yeah, I was told a lie and said there were no drones, even though it was an admitted drone program.
[02:10:20.376 --> 02:10:22.997]  They now admit two billion bullets bought the last 14 months.
[02:10:22.997 --> 02:10:25.318]  That's official federal government press releases.
[02:10:25.318 --> 02:10:33.041]  They came out in Politico and Slate saying Sarah Palin, whether you love her or hate her, is insane and there are no bullets being bought.
[02:10:33.041 --> 02:10:35.722]  They just said his internet rumor gave no proof.
[02:10:35.722 --> 02:10:38.443]  I mean, that's a thing that's been in AP Reuters, you name it.
[02:10:39.893 --> 02:10:47.260]  And I'm seeing more and more of this where all over the country they're passing laws to forcibly inoculate kids and saying they don't need parental consent.
[02:10:47.260 --> 02:10:55.267]  I mean, they're moving at light speed here and they're delusional because they're actually losing the public because of this.
[02:10:55.267 --> 02:10:57.029]  And they think just because there's election fraud...
[02:10:58.203 --> 02:11:01.384]  And they can keep re-electing their puppets that we're not seeing through it.
[02:11:01.384 --> 02:11:08.226]  I think we're getting to a Marie Antoinette French Revolution where they're about to beat down the palace gates and the people are starving.
[02:11:08.226 --> 02:11:14.228]  They're begging for food and thousands are dying a day in the city of Paris alone, Your Majesty.
[02:11:14.228 --> 02:11:20.610]  And she says, let them eat cake and went off to play with her French poodles and French bulldogs.
[02:11:20.610 --> 02:11:23.311]  And then they tore down the gates and killed everybody.
[02:11:23.311 --> 02:11:25.572]  So we're seeing these parallels.
[02:11:26.568 --> 02:11:27.489]  Uh, going on here.
[02:11:27.489 --> 02:11:34.875]  So I wanted to play this clip and then go to Gerald and get his take on where he sees America going because the system is not going to back down.
[02:11:34.875 --> 02:11:36.236]  More and more we see that's clear.
[02:11:36.236 --> 02:11:45.684]  Let's go to this Robert Gibbs clip of where he makes a joke out of it that he was lying to the public under orders, lying about something that it's like saying New York City doesn't exist.
[02:11:45.684 --> 02:11:47.365]  I mean, it's, it's, it's that bad.
[02:11:47.365 --> 02:11:49.107]  And what is the method to the madness?
[02:11:49.107 --> 02:11:49.467]  Here it is.
[02:11:49.747 --> 02:11:57.813]  When I went through the process of becoming press secretary, one of the first things they told me was, you're not even to acknowledge the drone program.
[02:11:57.813 --> 02:12:01.096]  You're not even to discuss that it exists.
[02:12:01.096 --> 02:12:11.304]  And so I would get a question like that, and literally I couldn't tell you what major ass, because once I figured out it was about the drone program, I realized I'm not supposed to talk about it.
[02:12:11.304 --> 02:12:14.086]  But here's what's inherently crazy about that proposition.
[02:12:14.887 --> 02:12:20.833]  You're being asked a question based on reporting of a program that exists.
[02:12:20.833 --> 02:12:21.213]  Right?
[02:12:21.213 --> 02:12:29.161]  So you're the official government spokesperson acting as if the entire program... Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
[02:12:29.161 --> 02:12:31.704]  Now see, don't look at the little man behind the curtain.
[02:12:31.704 --> 02:12:34.026]  That's a Wizard of Oz illusion.
[02:12:34.026 --> 02:12:36.889]  And so we've gotten to this point now where on purpose
[02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:43.386]  We're like, hey, you're confiscating guns in New York and arresting veterans for clips over 10 mags.
[02:12:43.386 --> 02:12:44.488]  Well, that's not tyranny.
[02:12:44.488 --> 02:12:53.819]  Or, we don't want your guns as they introduce the bills federally to ban them and we get the official memorandums from the Justice Department about their plan to register and then confiscate all guns.
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:55.662]  And that's not even a news item.
[02:12:55.662 --> 02:13:00.227]  It's the deception and the military tactic of saying, this isn't an assault.
[02:13:00.227 --> 02:13:06.795]  It's like Mars attacks, where the aliens are shooting people with ray guns, with loudspeakers saying, don't run, we are your friends.
[02:13:06.795 --> 02:13:11.120]  And people are stopping because they say that, and the aliens are shooting them and then laughing.
[02:13:11.841 --> 02:13:13.382]  So this is a military tactic.
[02:13:13.382 --> 02:13:21.825]  Gerald Solente, quantify this because for those of us that are half awake or informed, it's comical and it wasn't so serious.
[02:13:21.825 --> 02:13:30.848]  What is the master strategy here to induce us into mass Stockholm Syndrome or learned helplessness or is the word normalcy bias?
[02:13:30.848 --> 02:13:36.330]  What is the tactic and am I right from your research that things are getting much worse very quickly?
[02:13:40.157 --> 02:13:42.979]  And the Cylon Raiders have attacked.
[02:13:42.979 --> 02:13:45.820]  Gerald Salente joining us via the miracle of Skype.
[02:13:45.820 --> 02:13:50.423]  Gerald, did you get that question, that long question?
[02:13:50.423 --> 02:13:53.465]  Yeah, we just lost your Skype.
[02:13:53.465 --> 02:13:59.048]  Okay, yeah, they've been having power outages and stuff because of the storms, and we're going to work that out with Gerald Salente.
[02:13:59.048 --> 02:14:02.370]  But you heard my big question there.
[02:14:02.370 --> 02:14:03.191]  To everyone,
[02:14:04.398 --> 02:14:07.864]  About what we're facing as a society.
[02:14:07.864 --> 02:14:11.290]  We were worried about the interview with Gerald because he's been having intermittent power outages.
[02:14:11.290 --> 02:14:14.435]  And again, that was actually a transmission from Cylon.
[02:14:14.435 --> 02:14:18.501]  And then if the public proved there wasn't a transmission from Cylon, I would say, no, no, the Cylons are real.
[02:14:19.502 --> 02:14:23.064]  And we're like, well, we have a memo where you admit the Cylons aren't real and that it's a movie.
[02:14:23.064 --> 02:14:24.065]  Cylons are real.
[02:14:24.065 --> 02:14:25.926]  You are a conspiracy theorist.
[02:14:25.926 --> 02:14:27.006]  So what do you do?
[02:14:27.006 --> 02:14:40.074]  I mean, we need to understand this is a psychological tactic now where they say we are not going to put toll roads on I-35 and then they officially are and you go to the meeting and they go, we are not putting toll roads on I-35.
[02:14:40.074 --> 02:14:41.035]  We are putting them on I-35.
[02:14:42.622 --> 02:14:48.366]  And you go, but here you are a year ago swearing and it's law, you can't put it on 35 or Mopac, and now you're saying you're doing it.
[02:14:48.366 --> 02:14:52.869]  Well, we are not doing it, but we are.
[02:14:52.869 --> 02:14:58.133]  And you're at a public meeting going, here's the official printout, we're here, you're about to vote on this at the Campo board today.
[02:14:59.417 --> 02:15:00.558]  And they go, no we're not.
[02:15:16.718 --> 02:15:28.908]  You know, the mirror in the bathroom steamed up, you walk in, the wife is in bed with another man, you say, get off my wife, and they go, there is no wife, there is no man, there is no, oh, you're an Easter Bunny, and you're like, I'm an Easter Bunny.
[02:15:28.908 --> 02:15:31.290]  I mean, what are they doing?
[02:15:31.290 --> 02:15:32.851]  What is happening?
[02:15:32.851 --> 02:15:34.813]  Okay, then that's my first question for Gerald.
[02:15:34.813 --> 02:15:36.714]  Do we have him via phone?
[02:15:36.714 --> 02:15:38.776]  This is quite the buildup, let me tell you.
[02:15:41.022 --> 02:15:44.066]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is exciting.
[02:15:44.066 --> 02:15:46.910]  Hey, Gerald's great on the phone, though we can't look at him.
[02:15:46.910 --> 02:15:49.553]  Always sharply dressed.
[02:15:49.553 --> 02:15:51.716]  Okay, we have video and phone audio.
[02:15:51.716 --> 02:15:55.681]  Gerald, you heard my question about this tactic to boldly lie.
[02:15:55.681 --> 02:15:57.823]  Are they trying to train us that lies are okay?
[02:15:57.823 --> 02:15:59.666]  Gerald Celente, TrendsJournal.com.
[02:16:00.276 --> 02:16:02.939]  What it is, Alex, it's fear and hysteria.
[02:16:02.939 --> 02:16:04.881]  They've been using it forever.
[02:16:04.881 --> 02:16:08.785]  And it's not only the Obama's press secretary.
[02:16:08.785 --> 02:16:12.770]  Go back to that whole situation under George Bush.
[02:16:12.770 --> 02:16:17.175]  Do you remember the guy that resigned and he refused to keep lying?
[02:16:18.038 --> 02:16:19.980]  And how about the Gulf of Tonkin?
[02:16:19.980 --> 02:16:21.902]  You could go back to that one.
[02:16:21.902 --> 02:16:26.907]  Alright, Saddam Hussein didn't have weapons of mass destruction at Taiz Tal Qaeda.
[02:16:26.907 --> 02:16:28.368]  It's much bigger than that.
[02:16:28.368 --> 02:16:36.296]  I believe we have to go back to President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces during World War II.
[02:16:37.257 --> 02:16:47.163]  A two-term Republican president and a five-star general who warned the people that the military-industrial complex is taking over the nation.
[02:16:47.163 --> 02:16:48.724]  And it's a takeover.
[02:16:48.724 --> 02:16:53.107]  It's not only the military-industrial complex taking us to war.
[02:16:53.107 --> 02:16:58.711]  They've already declared that we're in a state of war at home, and that gives them the license
[02:17:01.132 --> 02:17:03.654]  To surveil us all the time?
[02:17:03.654 --> 02:17:15.643]  I mean, you know what happened just a few days ago with the Supreme Court refusing to hear the case on warrantless wiretapping and watching us make every move that we make.
[02:17:15.643 --> 02:17:20.106]  So you can see it's a complete military takeover.
[02:17:20.106 --> 02:17:21.787]  Just different divisions of it.
[02:17:21.787 --> 02:17:22.248]  That's right.
[02:17:22.248 --> 02:17:24.109]  You just pierced right to the core of it.
[02:17:24.109 --> 02:17:26.311]  And from my research, you're absolutely right, Gerald.
[02:17:26.311 --> 02:17:28.712]  You said it in one minute when I said it in five.
[02:17:28.712 --> 02:17:29.333]  That is it.
[02:17:30.013 --> 02:17:42.123]  Under the rules of war you lie to people and they've now declared war on us and treat us as the enemy and officially say that and so we are treated as a foreign enemy and this is the white shoe Wall Street mega bank occupation.
[02:17:42.995 --> 02:17:52.062]  That's exactly what it is, and when you look at all of the wars past in modern history, the fundamentals behind the wars were economics.
[02:17:52.062 --> 02:17:54.724]  I've made this very clear over and over again.
[02:17:54.724 --> 02:17:57.746]  You don't even have to go back that far, Alex.
[02:17:57.746 --> 02:18:05.913]  You go back to the crash of 1929, the Great Depression, currency wars, trade wars, world war.
[02:18:05.913 --> 02:18:07.894]  You look at it now, the panic of 08.
[02:18:09.335 --> 02:18:10.716]  Currency wars.
[02:18:10.716 --> 02:18:11.517]  The Great Depression.
[02:18:11.517 --> 02:18:12.318]  We're in a depression.
[02:18:12.318 --> 02:18:27.071]  You know what they call over there in Italy, and in Spain, and in Greece, and in Portugal, with average unemployment around 20%, some places 27%, other places 15, 18%.
[02:18:27.071 --> 02:18:31.014]  They still call it a recession.
[02:18:31.014 --> 02:18:33.416]  Millions of people taking to the streets.
[02:18:33.416 --> 02:18:35.358]  It doesn't make the U.S.
[02:18:35.358 --> 02:18:35.838]  news.
[02:18:36.479 --> 02:18:38.360]  They're not talking about it.
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:43.923]  In Spain this last weekend, millions, millions of people took to the streets.
[02:18:43.923 --> 02:18:50.887]  Coming up tomorrow in Portugal, millions of people are slated to hit the streets again.
[02:18:50.887 --> 02:18:52.007]  It's a depression.
[02:18:52.007 --> 02:18:56.369]  And now you listen to the new Prime Minister of Japan.
[02:18:56.369 --> 02:19:02.853]  You listen to the head of the former head of the Bundesbank, now chairman of UBS.
[02:19:03.954 --> 02:19:12.180]  Alex Zerba, you listen to the head of the Bank of England, Mervyn King.
[02:19:12.180 --> 02:19:14.182]  We're in a currency war.
[02:19:14.182 --> 02:19:16.624]  Now they're talking about trade wars.
[02:19:16.624 --> 02:19:18.566]  Next is world war.
[02:19:18.566 --> 02:19:22.289]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:19:22.289 --> 02:19:24.551]  And that's what we're heading toward.
[02:19:24.551 --> 02:19:26.673]  And I believe they know it.
[02:19:27.293 --> 02:19:38.960]  Because as we're seeing what we saw in Italy recently, with the new party coming in and gaining all of that power, you saw the world equity markets go into panic.
[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:39.860]  Why?
[02:19:39.860 --> 02:19:48.125]  Because they know that the people are no longer going to take it, so they are preparing for the worst.
[02:19:48.125 --> 02:19:50.787]  And the worst is when the people hit the streets.
[02:19:51.627 --> 02:19:57.963]  And we're going to come back with that key information with Gerald Cilente and then get into the rest of the key info he's got to cover today.
[02:19:57.963 --> 02:19:58.905]  Stay tuned.
[02:19:58.905 --> 02:20:00.168]  Tell your friends and family, tune in.

[02:22:03.819 --> 02:22:05.921]  Have you considered your toilet posture?
[02:22:05.921 --> 02:22:09.684]  The colon needs proper alignment for faster, more effective elimination.
[02:22:09.684 --> 02:22:12.466]  And that's exactly what you'll get with a Squatty Potty.
[02:22:12.466 --> 02:22:19.131]  Not a cleanse or a pill, the Squatty Potty is a healthy step in the right direction, is doctor recommended, and starts at just $34.95.

[02:22:30.473 --> 02:22:31.694]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:31.694 --> 02:22:36.177]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:36.177 --> 02:22:41.900]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.900 --> 02:22:45.482]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:45.482 --> 02:22:48.164]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:24:03.231 --> 02:24:04.953]  All right, Gerald Cilente is our guest.
[02:24:04.953 --> 02:24:07.515]  I want to go right back where he left off.
[02:24:07.515 --> 02:24:17.463]  As they gear up for the implosion, as the bond markets get spooked, as the bubble we're in in America frays at the edges.
[02:24:17.463 --> 02:24:19.425]  Gerald, what do you expect to see happen?
[02:24:19.425 --> 02:24:20.106]  Gerald Cilente.
[02:24:20.851 --> 02:24:26.695]  Yes, before I move on to that, I want to follow up on what you were talking about with Gibbs and the lies.
[02:24:26.695 --> 02:24:36.861]  I remember now it was Scott McClellan under Bush, and actually we did a whole piece in the Trends Journal about how he wrote a book.
[02:24:37.501 --> 02:24:43.122]  And how they dismissed him and how the prostitutes tried to drive him into the ground.
[02:24:43.122 --> 02:24:57.944]  And we did a complete analysis of how all the prostitutes from ABC, CBS, CNN, the same names you hear today, knew it was a lie and were afraid to speak out.
[02:24:57.944 --> 02:25:06.126]  And here's something just from a couple of days ago from the toilet paper of record, the New York Times, about how they
[02:25:07.787 --> 02:25:14.957]  They cooked the books on the progress, the so-called progress in Afghanistan.
[02:25:14.957 --> 02:25:17.921]  You saw that article that just came out.
[02:25:17.921 --> 02:25:19.122]  Absolutely.
[02:25:19.122 --> 02:25:22.827]  Afghan signs of progress turned out to be error.
[02:25:23.508 --> 02:25:25.009]  Isn't that nice?
[02:25:25.009 --> 02:25:28.171]  Yeah, they forgot to carry a one, you know?
[02:25:28.171 --> 02:25:32.554]  So the whole thing is one big lie.
[02:25:32.554 --> 02:25:37.577]  Look what's going on as they're talking about sequestering, you know?
[02:25:37.577 --> 02:25:39.058]  You know, what's that?
[02:25:39.058 --> 02:25:45.883]  There's fear and hysteria from the DC drama queens and the Beltway Circle jerks.
[02:25:46.383 --> 02:25:48.526]  This is all they do.
[02:25:48.526 --> 02:25:51.329]  It's one failure after another.
[02:25:51.329 --> 02:25:54.633]  Oh, oh, oh, and here's the nice news.
[02:25:54.633 --> 02:25:59.740]  Hey, all you folks that are losing your homes, can't find a good job.
[02:25:59.740 --> 02:26:02.022]  Hey, Detroit's turning to crap.
[02:26:02.583 --> 02:26:04.904]  Camden's just wonderful.
[02:26:04.904 --> 02:26:11.246]  Would you like to have a vacation in a beautiful run-down U.S.
[02:26:11.246 --> 02:26:11.626]  city?
[02:26:11.626 --> 02:26:17.308]  Hey, they just sent more money to Friends of Syria!
[02:26:17.308 --> 02:26:19.388]  Isn't that wonderful?
[02:26:19.388 --> 02:26:20.809]  Nice Islamists
[02:26:21.249 --> 02:26:22.670]  Fronting for the U.S.
[02:26:22.670 --> 02:26:23.811]  military.
[02:26:23.811 --> 02:26:25.172]  Friends of Syria.
[02:26:25.172 --> 02:26:39.321]  Hey, why don't they start a Friends of Alex Jones and Gero Salenti campaign instead of sending these criminals already $400 million.
[02:26:39.321 --> 02:26:41.802]  Now get back to work, everybody.
[02:26:41.802 --> 02:26:43.884]  Stop those shells at Walmart.
[02:26:44.344 --> 02:26:54.787]  Put on a nice smile when you walk into Staples and say, have a nice day as you leave, as they rob your money to give it to their friends.
[02:26:54.787 --> 02:27:04.389]  So when you look at the news and you see a tiny little story on how they lied during the so-called troop surge,
[02:27:05.369 --> 02:27:11.656]  That wonderful liberal Obama sent 33,000 more troops to Afghanistan.
[02:27:11.656 --> 02:27:12.076]  Sure.
[02:27:12.076 --> 02:27:12.957]  Surge!
[02:27:12.957 --> 02:27:14.939]  It was a disaster.
[02:27:14.939 --> 02:27:17.581]  But they don't promote it as that.
[02:27:17.581 --> 02:27:20.344]  Oh, look for the white smoke coming out of the Vatican.
[02:27:20.344 --> 02:27:21.986]  That's what they're talking about today.
[02:27:23.035 --> 02:27:23.996]  Gerald, we're going to break.
[02:27:23.996 --> 02:27:25.838]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:27:25.838 --> 02:27:32.506]  We're going to get into the technicals and Bernanke and some of the points you wanted to get into when I asked you on the show.
[02:27:32.506 --> 02:27:38.412]  But before we do that, just specifically for listeners, I remember five years ago when Obama was first running.
[02:27:39.434 --> 02:27:49.988]  In the middle of the campaign they bragged that Google and Twitter were working with him and giving him their databases to send out fake tweets and fake Facebooks and I actually pulled the articles up.
[02:27:49.988 --> 02:27:55.256]  I remember last year USA Today did an article, Obama has millions of fake Twitter followers.
[02:27:55.256 --> 02:27:55.877]  It was admitted!
[02:27:56.317 --> 02:27:56.738]  We're good to go.
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:19.041]  Bush was doing this, but now it's expanded.
[02:28:19.041 --> 02:28:25.085]  They've got sock puppets, we've tracked it on InfoWars.com, that are fake anti-liberty people.
[02:28:25.085 --> 02:28:26.086]  It's on YouTube.
[02:28:26.086 --> 02:28:28.787]  That's all admitted, the Pentagon sock puppets.
[02:28:28.787 --> 02:28:29.828]  It's all admitted.
[02:28:29.828 --> 02:28:35.172]  But even congressmen who start to discover it, the media then lies and says they're lying.
[02:28:35.172 --> 02:28:37.914]  I mean, again, they deny things that are admitted.
[02:28:39.411 --> 02:28:42.112]  Well, again, of course they do.
[02:28:42.112 --> 02:28:44.374]  It's the whole corrupt system.
[02:28:44.374 --> 02:28:46.595]  Again, they take you to war for lies.
[02:28:46.595 --> 02:28:49.356]  They sacrifice our lives for lies.
[02:28:49.356 --> 02:28:51.217]  They steal our money for lies.
[02:28:51.217 --> 02:29:04.605]  Oh, and by the way, I want to let you know, you know, I go to your site every day, and the information that you're putting out there in some of those videos, like the one I just watched yesterday with being stopped at checkpoints,
[02:29:05.185 --> 02:29:09.428]  What, 50, 30 miles away from borders?
[02:29:09.428 --> 02:29:11.549]  People should see this all the time.
[02:29:11.549 --> 02:29:13.210]  It's up to 100.
[02:29:13.210 --> 02:29:14.851]  It's 100 miles away now.
[02:29:14.851 --> 02:29:17.232]  Well, the one I hit was 77, but yeah, they go up to 100.
[02:29:17.232 --> 02:29:24.717]  Yeah, so the atrocities that are being committed against us, and the people don't want to hear it.
[02:29:24.717 --> 02:29:26.898]  They're locked into their belief systems.
[02:29:26.898 --> 02:29:27.858]  Well, here's what I want to ask you.
[02:29:27.858 --> 02:29:30.920]  We've got to go to break, TrendsJournal.com, Gerald Celente.
[02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:33.602]  What do you then, because you've called all the big trends where they happen.
[02:29:34.122 --> 02:29:37.404]  What do you expect as a dead reckoning how all this will play out?
[02:29:37.404 --> 02:29:39.566]  I want to see you look far off in the future.
[02:29:39.566 --> 02:29:42.248]  Bad case, good case, ugly case.
[02:29:42.248 --> 02:29:47.671]  And then I want to get into the current technical financials and the new Trends Journal that's coming out and the free trends alerts.
[02:29:47.671 --> 02:29:50.333]  People can sign up for it at TrendsJournal.com.
[02:29:50.333 --> 02:29:51.734]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.734 --> 02:29:54.256]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.256 --> 02:29:56.938]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.050 --> 02:30:11.154]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[02:30:11.154 --> 02:30:15.235]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[02:30:15.235 --> 02:30:22.539]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.
[02:30:22.539 --> 02:30:25.360]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:30.404]  Or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:30:30.404 --> 02:30:36.349]  Buy the 1 to 2 month sample package and enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:30:36.349 --> 02:30:41.753]  Or save big with a 1 to 2 year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs.
[02:30:41.753 --> 02:30:43.734]  This is an amazing deal.
[02:30:43.734 --> 02:30:48.958]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[02:30:48.958 --> 02:30:52.121]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call
[02:30:52.341 --> 02:30:53.803]  Call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:31:01.144 --> 02:31:08.150]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:12.794]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.
[02:31:12.794 --> 02:31:23.603]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary, broad-spectrum, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal solution that can be used inside the body as well as on the skin.
[02:31:23.603 --> 02:31:28.868]  Supernatural Silver is unique and superior to colloidal and ionic silvers.
[02:31:29.068 --> 02:31:29.388]  I think so.
[02:32:00.809 --> 02:32:08.011]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[02:32:08.011 --> 02:32:25.616]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:32:25.896 --> 02:32:32.084]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[02:32:32.084 --> 02:32:40.234]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:32:40.234 --> 02:32:41.676]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.
[02:32:43.758 --> 02:32:46.541]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:32:46.541 --> 02:32:47.823]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:32:47.823 --> 02:32:48.683]  It's incredible.
[02:32:48.683 --> 02:32:57.913]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[02:32:57.913 --> 02:33:00.095]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[02:33:06.618 --> 02:33:07.499]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:07.499 --> 02:33:10.783]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:25.970 --> 02:33:31.292]  We not only like to plug our new affiliates, and there's going to be a whole bunch of them we've got to mention next week.
[02:33:31.292 --> 02:33:36.275]  Three or four new ones, and several I didn't mention last week, so I guess five or six next week we'll be mentioning.
[02:33:38.359 --> 02:33:39.280]  Maybe even tomorrow.
[02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:42.763]  Except I'm not doing the show tomorrow, it's Mike Adams, so that's why it's next week.
[02:33:42.763 --> 02:33:51.890]  Affiliates In Focus, WASB, 1590 AM in Rochester, New York, has been carrying the show for almost 15 years.
[02:33:51.890 --> 02:33:58.356]  Probably our oldest affiliate next to WBCR outside Knoxville and the great Harry Grothjohn down there.
[02:33:59.036 --> 02:34:01.539]  So 14, 15 years, WASB.
[02:34:01.539 --> 02:34:06.305]  Because we had some affiliates that were even older, but those change formats or sell.
[02:34:06.305 --> 02:34:10.329]  These are our oldest affiliates, almost 15 years.
[02:34:10.329 --> 02:34:13.993]  WASB, 1590 A.M., Rochester, New York.
[02:34:13.993 --> 02:34:17.097]  Big thanks to Gail Reed and the staff at WASB.
[02:34:18.382 --> 02:34:25.865]  And then a newer affiliate, WRPW 92.9 FM in Bloomington, Illinois.
[02:34:25.865 --> 02:34:27.606]  The news and talk of Bloomington.
[02:34:27.606 --> 02:34:30.628]  Check out events and contests at Cities929.com.
[02:34:30.628 --> 02:34:31.148]  Cities929.com.
[02:34:36.090 --> 02:34:37.130]  So, very thankful.
[02:34:37.130 --> 02:34:38.771]  Over 150 affiliates.
[02:34:38.771 --> 02:34:45.272]  And every week I like to thank a couple of the older affiliates and the newer ones, but also plug the new ones.
[02:34:45.272 --> 02:34:49.954]  So, so very, very exciting that all of that is happening.
[02:34:49.954 --> 02:34:53.454]  And what happens is stations end up picking up the Sunday show.
[02:34:53.454 --> 02:34:58.136]  Then they, which is live, and we did that on purpose so they'd have something to put their toe in the water.
[02:34:58.136 --> 02:35:01.796]  Something to test, you know, test us out.
[02:35:01.796 --> 02:35:03.417]  And then they end up putting us on at night.
[02:35:04.676 --> 02:35:08.327]  And then we get higher ratings on their daytime shows and they end up putting us on live.
[02:35:08.327 --> 02:35:09.991]  And it's pretty much the same thing has happened, uh...
[02:35:12.273 --> 02:35:16.256]  At every station we've been on, by the grace of God, very exciting and thanks for putting up with me.

[02:35:54.394 --> 02:36:02.937]  It is the best stuff we've found, all assembled in one area, and there's a lot of videos of myself and doctors and researchers and Aaron Dykes there at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[02:36:03.937 --> 02:36:08.819]  Okay, I'm going to try to really shut up and give Gerald Cilente the floor because he's got a lot to cover.
[02:36:08.819 --> 02:36:15.063]  And I really also enjoy watching the new TV news updates they're doing over at TrendsJournal.com.
[02:36:15.063 --> 02:36:18.884]  They're just really adding a lot more over there via demand.
[02:36:18.884 --> 02:36:21.806]  People want more and we appreciate him giving us time here.
[02:36:21.806 --> 02:36:23.567]  So, you heard my question before the break.
[02:36:23.567 --> 02:36:25.648]  No need to restate it other than for new listeners.
[02:36:26.648 --> 02:36:28.129]  We've seen this in history.
[02:36:28.129 --> 02:36:31.751]  We see the arrogance of the elite where they start smoking their own dope.
[02:36:31.751 --> 02:36:35.453]  I don't see this going well for civilization or the establishment.
[02:36:35.453 --> 02:36:40.015]  I don't think they're going to get away with what they're doing, but they may bring down society in the process.
[02:36:40.015 --> 02:36:45.458]  So looking out into the future, the good scenarios, the bad scenarios, the ugly scenarios.
[02:36:45.458 --> 02:36:47.179]  Let's start with the bad scenarios.
[02:36:47.179 --> 02:36:50.681]  What happens if this continues a year, two years, five years?
[02:36:50.681 --> 02:36:51.241]  Where does it lead?
[02:36:52.162 --> 02:36:55.763]  Well, again, let's look at the financial facts first.
[02:36:55.763 --> 02:37:04.086]  We just saw the Dog and Pony Show put on by Osama Ben Bernanke, America's public enemy number one.
[02:37:04.086 --> 02:37:09.988]  And I say that, the Federal Reserve Chairman, there's a couple of important things to remember about this.
[02:37:11.104 --> 02:37:18.028]  You know, Alex, it takes them five years as part of the whole scam to release the Fed Minutes for we the people to read.
[02:37:18.028 --> 02:37:19.169]  Isn't that wonderful?
[02:37:19.169 --> 02:37:22.450]  We're too stupid to read them as they come out.
[02:37:22.450 --> 02:37:24.131]  They have to wait for five years.
[02:37:24.131 --> 02:37:28.234]  Of course, they do that purposefully so that we can't see how dumb they are.
[02:37:28.874 --> 02:37:49.268]  Because everybody can now see what morons they are, when you see that as the crash was happening, the panic of 08 was underway, and as we were warning everyone that it was happening, the Federal Reserve, from their minutes, none of them, none of them saw it coming, and they kept denying the facts.
[02:37:49.268 --> 02:37:57.253]  So now we fast forward to now, five years later, and there's Bernanke a few days ago, at the Congressional hearings.
[02:37:57.253 --> 02:37:58.554]  And what does he say?
[02:37:59.574 --> 02:38:04.036]  Well, first, what he said was that they're going to keep the stimulus going.
[02:38:04.036 --> 02:38:06.257]  They call it quantitative easing.
[02:38:06.257 --> 02:38:12.579]  Of course, that's white shoe boy language for printing digital money not worth the paper it's not printed on.
[02:38:12.579 --> 02:38:14.780]  And this is historical.
[02:38:14.780 --> 02:38:17.401]  Nothing has ever happened like this in history.
[02:38:17.941 --> 02:38:20.563]  Because it's not only the United States.
[02:38:20.563 --> 02:38:25.566]  As I mentioned, the new Bank of Japan guy, he's printing more money as well.
[02:38:25.566 --> 02:38:28.848]  You go over to Europe, they have a different name for it.
[02:38:28.848 --> 02:38:36.794]  That guy, Mario Draghi, who's the head of the European Central Bank, just a little background on him, of course.
[02:38:36.794 --> 02:38:42.418]  He was the former vice chairman of the European division of the Goldman Sachs gang.
[02:38:43.078 --> 02:38:47.180]  They call it long-term refinancing operations.
[02:38:47.180 --> 02:38:48.840]  You can't remember that name?
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:50.901]  Try throwing out Elthro.
[02:38:50.901 --> 02:38:53.382]  And then try throwing this into it.
[02:38:53.382 --> 02:38:56.224]  You look at how they were supposed to pay back the money?
[02:38:56.224 --> 02:38:58.925]  Well, the numbers just came in a few days ago.
[02:38:58.925 --> 02:39:01.166]  Of course it doesn't make the prestitute press.
[02:39:01.806 --> 02:39:05.150]  They're not paying it back, they don't have the dough.
[02:39:05.150 --> 02:39:12.779]  So now you're looking at, well come up with another word, if five letters are too much, how about OMT?
[02:39:12.779 --> 02:39:16.183]  Ongoing Monetary Transactions, you like that one?
[02:39:16.183 --> 02:39:17.764]  We'll keep printing more money.
[02:39:18.445 --> 02:39:25.128]  So you look at China as well, they're doing it differently, and I have to admit, much smarter.
[02:39:25.128 --> 02:39:33.412]  Because they're not only giving the money to the banks, what they're doing, this may upset a lot of people, they're building the infrastructure.
[02:39:33.792 --> 02:39:34.974]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:39:34.974 --> 02:39:38.678]  They have rail systems there that put ours to shame.
[02:39:38.678 --> 02:39:44.245]  They're taking all the fiat crud that's soon to be worth nothing and building a civilization with it.
[02:39:44.245 --> 02:39:51.094]  And the globalists have put policies here to shut us down while allowing them to develop because China, according to the CFR, is the future.
[02:39:52.153 --> 02:39:52.733]  Exactly.
[02:39:52.733 --> 02:39:55.636]  I mean, you look at that guy Bloomberg, the mayor in New York.
[02:39:55.636 --> 02:40:00.239]  He's going all around the country, you know, touting his gun control program.
[02:40:00.239 --> 02:40:03.821]  Hey, Bloomberg, do you ever go down into the subway?
[02:40:03.821 --> 02:40:06.423]  You want a day in Calcutta?
[02:40:06.423 --> 02:40:09.045]  Try riding the New York subways.
[02:40:09.045 --> 02:40:10.546]  It's a disgrace.
[02:40:10.546 --> 02:40:12.007]  I travel the world.
[02:40:12.007 --> 02:40:16.911]  There's no place as disgraceful as the subway system in America.
[02:40:16.911 --> 02:40:19.633]  Rats, feces, being mugged.
[02:40:19.633 --> 02:40:20.253]  I've been in there.
[02:40:20.253 --> 02:40:21.014]  It's pretty scary.
[02:40:21.454 --> 02:40:25.797]  Yeah, or get thrown onto the tracks, have a nice day, you know?
[02:40:25.797 --> 02:40:32.661]  So, as we're looking at it, now Bernanke is coming out and saying, here's the warning signal.
[02:40:34.170 --> 02:40:35.972]  Interest rates may go up.
[02:40:35.972 --> 02:40:40.897]  It's going, he says, it's going to be showing a sign of economic vitality.
[02:40:40.897 --> 02:40:42.058]  You know what that is?
[02:40:42.058 --> 02:40:43.199]  That's BS.
[02:40:43.199 --> 02:40:46.983]  Because, look at the numbers that just came out today!
[02:40:46.983 --> 02:40:47.824]  Oh yeah!
[02:40:47.824 --> 02:40:51.287]  Hey, GDP for the first, the last quarter of 2012,
[02:40:53.169 --> 02:40:56.070]  It didn't decline 0.1%.
[02:40:56.070 --> 02:40:56.751]  It grew 0.1%.
[02:40:56.751 --> 02:41:01.933]  Oh, wonderful, wonderful growth.
[02:41:01.933 --> 02:41:04.294]  So what they're saying, there is no vitality.
[02:41:04.294 --> 02:41:09.416]  I'm pointing this out, Alex, so that people can be prepared for what's going to happen.
[02:41:09.416 --> 02:41:12.278]  At some point, they're going to have to raise interest rates.
[02:41:13.058 --> 02:41:14.319]  You can't keep this going.
[02:41:14.319 --> 02:41:15.940]  This is unprecedented.
[02:41:15.940 --> 02:41:17.942]  As I said, it's worldwide.
[02:41:17.942 --> 02:41:22.345]  All they're doing is shoveling money in to keep the Ponzi scheme going.
[02:41:22.345 --> 02:41:27.709]  Oh, and just to show that it's not going, another little story that just came out.
[02:41:27.709 --> 02:41:33.113]  That $83 billion in profits that the big banks reported last year,
[02:41:33.573 --> 02:41:35.797]  They weren't profits at all!
[02:41:35.797 --> 02:41:40.865]  It's because we the taxpayer is subsidizing them to get cheap money!
[02:41:40.865 --> 02:41:44.391]  So now, going back to the interest rates.
[02:41:44.391 --> 02:41:45.873]  Why is the housing market...
[02:41:47.491 --> 02:41:48.832]  Pumped up again.
[02:41:48.832 --> 02:41:50.534]  Because you could borrow money.
[02:41:50.534 --> 02:41:53.116]  I just bought properties over here, as you know.
[02:41:53.116 --> 02:41:57.219]  I'm buying historical properties in colonial Kingston.
[02:41:57.219 --> 02:42:01.842]  I bought a 1750s house, a 1774.
[02:42:01.842 --> 02:42:03.243]  You're betting on America.
[02:42:03.243 --> 02:42:05.005]  Your ideas don't leave the country.
[02:42:05.005 --> 02:42:06.045]  You're betting on America.
[02:42:06.045 --> 02:42:07.286]  You're all in.
[02:42:07.286 --> 02:42:08.267]  Exactly.
[02:42:08.267 --> 02:42:11.670]  But the last one I just got a loan for
[02:42:12.610 --> 02:42:21.814]  It's a residential from 17, I think, 68, for 2.87%.
[02:42:21.814 --> 02:42:25.135]  And it's locked in for 15 years.
[02:42:25.135 --> 02:42:27.856]  I mean, you're paying these back with cheap money.
[02:42:27.856 --> 02:42:32.137]  But now, interest rates are going to have to go up.
[02:42:32.137 --> 02:42:37.359]  That's going to stop the real estate from, it'll go back into a steep decline.
[02:42:37.359 --> 02:42:41.421]  Now, number two, they're also pointing to auto sales.
[02:42:41.821 --> 02:42:42.982]  Oh brilliant.
[02:42:42.982 --> 02:42:45.165]  I got a deal for you, pal.
[02:42:45.165 --> 02:42:48.809]  How about zero percent for 60 months?
[02:42:48.809 --> 02:42:53.895]  It's just another scam like they did in the mortgage market.
[02:42:53.895 --> 02:42:56.177]  But now they're doing it in the auto market.
[02:42:56.698 --> 02:43:02.340]  So everything they're doing is they're creating another bubble!
[02:43:02.340 --> 02:43:04.441]  It cannot continue!
[02:43:04.441 --> 02:43:11.103]  When we're talking about the sequestering baloney and fiscal cliffs, this is chump change!
[02:43:11.103 --> 02:43:21.986]  They're never going to pay off $16.5 trillion in debt, plus, plus, plus, plus, when you put the pensions and other things into it.
[02:43:21.986 --> 02:43:23.067]  So what does this mean?
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:27.142]  They're going to devalue the currency.
[02:43:27.142 --> 02:43:30.925]  They did the same thing during the Great Depression.
[02:43:30.925 --> 02:43:48.519]  And when I talk, by the way, and I'll get back to the Great Depression and how they devalue the dollar, but when I talk about currency wars and world wars, do you know, Alex, that as the trade wars started heating up and the countries try to sell more of their crap, Japan
[02:43:50.011 --> 02:44:03.039]  Took themselves off the gold standard and lowered the value of the yen to 60% below the US dollar and 40% below the pound sterling.
[02:44:03.039 --> 02:44:09.323]  That allowed them to export more products, hence the trade wars and world wars.
[02:44:09.323 --> 02:44:14.287]  The United States tried to do the same thing, but they weren't as successful at it.
[02:44:14.867 --> 02:44:19.530]  We were on the gold standard back then, as you well know and the listeners do too.
[02:44:19.530 --> 02:44:25.293]  They made us return our gold to the Federal Reserve.
[02:44:25.293 --> 02:44:28.235]  They took our money and then they devalued.
[02:44:28.235 --> 02:44:34.059]  It was $32, I believe, in 60 cents an ounce or something like that.
[02:44:34.059 --> 02:44:44.125]  When we turned it all in, they re-pegged the price of gold at $35 an ounce, which meant that you lost 70% of your purchasing power.
[02:44:44.765 --> 02:44:46.787]  That's what they're going to do.
[02:44:46.787 --> 02:44:49.989]  They're going to devalue our currency.
[02:44:49.989 --> 02:44:54.333]  Why aren't gold prices going higher?
[02:44:54.333 --> 02:44:58.977]  They're only about, as we speak now, about what, $1580?
[02:44:58.977 --> 02:45:03.600]  The reason, I believe, is that they're rigging the market.
[02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:05.342]  A conspiracy theory?
[02:45:05.342 --> 02:45:06.042]  No.
[02:45:06.042 --> 02:45:08.244]  No, look at LIBOR.
[02:45:08.244 --> 02:45:08.824]  You got it.
[02:45:09.778 --> 02:45:10.859]  You got it.
[02:45:10.859 --> 02:45:12.260]  Look at LIBOR.
[02:45:12.260 --> 02:45:18.606]  How many hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of interest rates were rigged?
[02:45:18.606 --> 02:45:21.588]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[02:45:21.588 --> 02:45:23.089]  It's fact.
[02:45:23.089 --> 02:45:24.591]  It's hard fact.
[02:45:25.251 --> 02:45:30.817]  So if they're rigging that, of course they're rigging gold, because... Well, they've been caught doing it before.
[02:45:30.817 --> 02:45:33.320]  I mean, and they've got fake tungsten gold.
[02:45:33.320 --> 02:45:38.785]  And the proof is, as you've said, Germany and all these other countries, like Venezuela, they want their gold back.
[02:45:38.785 --> 02:45:42.869]  And the Federal Reserve is like, we'll give it to you in installments over the next decade.
[02:45:43.857 --> 02:45:44.718]  Yeah, right.
[02:45:44.718 --> 02:45:50.261]  You know, when they kept bringing it over by carrier pigeon, it's going to take to 2020?
[02:45:50.261 --> 02:45:52.442]  The gold's not there!
[02:45:52.442 --> 02:46:01.848]  And they know that by debasing the currencies and people going into gold, it will bring down the Ponzi scheme.
[02:46:02.728 --> 02:46:09.472]  So that's why they're debasing, they're driving, gold markets are very thinly traded.
[02:46:09.472 --> 02:46:14.335]  It's very easy to be manipulating them as well as silver.
[02:46:14.335 --> 02:46:19.998]  So for me, again, I do not give financial advice only for myself.
[02:46:19.998 --> 02:46:22.079]  I continue to buy gold.
[02:46:22.079 --> 02:46:27.002]  I continue to buy silver because I believe it's a Ponzi scheme.
[02:46:28.923 --> 02:46:30.363]  Other investments aren't perfect.
[02:46:30.363 --> 02:46:32.864]  Anything's going to be better than a devalued dollar.
[02:46:32.864 --> 02:46:40.826]  So if you've got surplus funds, real estate, gold, silver, but you've got to study the real estate or you can get your butt handed to you.
[02:46:40.826 --> 02:46:46.587]  Again, I'm only buying historic buildings on the most historic corner in the United States.
[02:46:46.587 --> 02:46:51.029]  The only place on each corner is a pre-revolutionary stone building.
[02:46:51.029 --> 02:46:51.409]  No, I understand.
[02:46:51.409 --> 02:46:51.949]  How long?
[02:46:51.949 --> 02:46:53.269]  Because I love this country.
[02:46:53.269 --> 02:46:54.929]  I understand.
[02:46:54.929 --> 02:46:56.490]  How long until they raise the interest rates?
[02:46:57.210 --> 02:47:01.294]  It's hard to tell because it depends on the currency wars.
[02:47:01.294 --> 02:47:05.559]  We just saw Venezuela devalue their currency.
[02:47:05.559 --> 02:47:08.301]  And we're watching what's going on in Japan.
[02:47:08.301 --> 02:47:10.644]  And they never announce it beforehand, they just do it, boom!
[02:47:11.755 --> 02:47:14.397]  They do it, not only that, look what the Swiss did.
[02:47:14.397 --> 02:47:18.459]  I used to call the Swiss the money cockroaches of the world.
[02:47:18.459 --> 02:47:20.920]  And I used to invest in Swiss francs.
[02:47:20.920 --> 02:47:28.365]  But then they pegged it to the euro because the franc was becoming so expensive, their companies couldn't export product.
[02:47:28.365 --> 02:47:30.186]  So yeah, they're gonna do it like that.
[02:47:30.186 --> 02:47:39.251]  But I believe the flashpoint is going to be terror or war, fake flag or real.
[02:47:41.767 --> 02:47:54.971]  I agree with you and now the Attorney General who ran Fast and Furious is back in the news openly saying that the anti-government people, you and I, Ron Paul, that we're the new terror threat.
[02:47:54.971 --> 02:47:57.772]  I mean how obvious, the whole Homeland Security grid.
[02:47:57.772 --> 02:48:01.393]  Now Al-Qaeda's our buddy over there fighting Assad.
[02:48:01.393 --> 02:48:03.353]  The globalists say we're the terrorists.
[02:48:03.353 --> 02:48:08.655]  I mean this is just textbook central government takeover by a bunch of crooks.
[02:48:09.355 --> 02:48:10.116]  It is.
[02:48:10.116 --> 02:48:13.258]  I want to go back to that Gibbs point.
[02:48:13.258 --> 02:48:16.160]  My staff got me the Trends Journal.
[02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:22.446]  It was the one with that wonderful Anthony Frida, screw the people piece.
[02:48:22.446 --> 02:48:22.626]  Here.
[02:48:23.951 --> 02:48:37.824]  There was a sense of pressure from the corporations who own where we work, and from government itself, to really squash any dissent.
[02:48:37.824 --> 02:48:39.185]  This is about the Iraq War.
[02:48:41.314 --> 02:48:55.438]  Katie Couric, quote, I could remember getting in trouble with administration officials because of asking questions they didn't feel comfortable with.
[02:48:55.438 --> 02:48:57.938]  Sound familiar?
[02:48:57.938 --> 02:48:58.578]  Here we go.
[02:48:58.578 --> 02:48:59.659]  Sounds like Bob Woodward.
[02:48:59.659 --> 02:49:00.579]  And here's the thing.
[02:49:00.579 --> 02:49:04.020]  They later tattle about it like it makes it OK that they lied to us.
[02:49:04.819 --> 02:49:06.119]  And what kind of courage?
[02:49:06.119 --> 02:49:13.021]  Imagine dying and knowing you were a person like this, with no courage, dignity, or self-respect.
[02:49:13.021 --> 02:49:13.841]  It gets better.
[02:49:13.841 --> 02:49:26.305]  There was a drumbeat of support from the administration, and it is not our job to debate them!
[02:49:26.305 --> 02:49:27.025]  Coward!
[02:49:28.154 --> 02:49:30.155]  That prostitute... Did you hear that?
[02:49:30.155 --> 02:49:33.316]  It's not our job to debate the government.
[02:49:33.316 --> 02:49:36.837]  We regurgitate whatever they vomit on us.
[02:49:36.837 --> 02:49:37.497]  That's right.
[02:49:37.497 --> 02:49:42.299]  That was from Charlie Gibson, ABC.
[02:49:42.299 --> 02:49:56.004]  And we go on to write, Whistleblower McClellan accused the White House, this is the wars that they sold us, you know, that cost us a trillion dollars, that wounded hundreds of thousands of our
[02:49:56.684 --> 02:50:01.671]  Friends and neighbors and relatives fighting a useless war?
[02:50:01.671 --> 02:50:05.916]  Killed 5,000 and about a million Iraqis?
[02:50:05.916 --> 02:50:06.717]  Yeah, here.
[02:50:07.748 --> 02:50:30.576]  Whistleblower McClellan accused the White House, quote, of spreading distortions, shading the truth, speaking half-truths, and telling, quote, outright lies in a, quote, political propaganda campaign to sell the war to the American people, end quote.
[02:50:30.976 --> 02:50:33.857]  Where are the war tribunals?
[02:50:33.857 --> 02:50:38.197]  How come these people that took us to war are not being brought up on war crimes?
[02:50:38.197 --> 02:50:43.758]  And what's amazing, it then gives a green light to the next tyrant, Obama, to do whatever he wants, and then he gets away with it all.
[02:50:43.758 --> 02:50:50.039]  Benghazi, all these other energy scams, the stuff that's happened with Fast and Furious.
[02:50:50.039 --> 02:50:53.860]  I mean, it is just... The green light's been given, so what's coming next?
[02:50:53.860 --> 02:50:55.880]  How do we fight back against it?
[02:50:55.880 --> 02:50:59.241]  Bradley Manning has now pled guilty, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:51:01.308 --> 02:51:03.691]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[02:51:03.691 --> 02:51:06.994]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[02:51:06.994 --> 02:51:13.141]  Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun, but the correct answer will shock you.
[02:51:13.141 --> 02:51:20.969]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[02:51:22.011 --> 02:51:25.355]  97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[02:51:25.355 --> 02:51:27.517]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought.
[02:51:27.517 --> 02:51:35.006]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[02:51:35.006 --> 02:51:39.492]  But I have to tell you, it could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[02:51:39.992 --> 02:51:46.216]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[02:51:46.216 --> 02:51:47.557]  You'll be shocked.
[02:51:47.557 --> 02:51:52.780]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[02:51:52.780 --> 02:51:58.243]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:51:58.243 --> 02:52:01.485]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[02:52:01.485 --> 02:52:03.286]  Hey everybody, Ty Bollinger here.
[02:52:03.286 --> 02:52:05.548]  Once again, real life, real stories.
[02:52:05.948 --> 02:52:12.831]  And he discovered Carnivora, was so thrilled with the product that he shared it with his family and his friends and his patients.
[02:52:12.831 --> 02:52:15.251]  My dad was a family physician, he was a medical doctor.
[02:52:15.251 --> 02:52:18.132]  Almost all the symptoms were either diminished or gone.
[02:52:18.132 --> 02:52:20.353]  Amazing product, amazing results.
[02:52:20.353 --> 02:52:27.596]  It's like an amazing thing having such a profound change of how I feel and knowing that it was Carnivora that did it.
[02:52:27.956 --> 02:52:33.899]  And a lot of patients got better, ranging from immune dysfunction to allergies and infection.
[02:52:42.824 --> 02:52:42.964]  I think?
[02:53:01.050 --> 02:53:04.253]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water?
[02:53:04.253 --> 02:53:07.616]  If so, keep listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters.
[02:53:07.616 --> 02:53:10.598]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?
[02:53:10.598 --> 02:53:21.527]  Berkey Water Filters distinguish themselves from many other filtration systems with the capability to significantly reduce dangerous chlorine, fluoride, arsenic, and disinfection byproducts from municipal water via the Black Berkey and PF line of filters.
[02:53:21.527 --> 02:53:22.668]  Then there's affordability.
[02:53:22.668 --> 02:53:27.252]  At only 1.7 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water.
[02:53:27.432 --> 02:53:28.833]  Even stagnant pond water.
[02:53:28.833 --> 02:53:34.838]  Stop and think how much money you could save by simply reducing buying bottled water and using water filtered by your Berkey water filter.
[02:53:34.838 --> 02:53:37.741]  No need to be constantly replacing expensive filters with a Berkey.
[02:53:37.741 --> 02:53:40.183]  A single set of filters can last for 5 to 10 years.
[02:53:40.183 --> 02:53:43.726]  Choose the best size Berkey for your needs at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.

[02:53:58.612 --> 02:53:59.797]  For the love of clean water.
[02:54:18.993 --> 02:54:23.116]  Yeah, Bradley Manning has pled guilty to misusing classified data in WikiLeaks.
[02:54:23.116 --> 02:54:29.361]  But what about journalists they arrest who report crimes of government people, like that CIA guy that exposed illegal torture?
[02:54:29.361 --> 02:54:33.084]  He's spending 30 months in jail for doing his job.
[02:54:33.084 --> 02:54:39.028]  I mean, shame on the FBI, shame on the federal government, shame on those juries, what they've turned into.
[02:54:39.028 --> 02:54:41.991]  I mean, this is so dangerous.
[02:54:41.991 --> 02:54:45.754]  And you've got a government using fake Twitter and Facebook accounts, and they get caught
[02:54:46.584 --> 02:54:49.686]  And then they just deny it, and the media goes along with it.
[02:54:49.686 --> 02:55:05.075]  By the way, if you want the best gravity-fed stainless steel filters, side-by-side comparisons with the leading competition, blows them away, what I use, ProPure, available at InfowarsStore.com, discounted, the lowest price anywhere, 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:55:05.075 --> 02:55:07.656]  Go to the site, buy the books, buy the videos, buy the materials.
[02:55:07.656 --> 02:55:09.237]  It helps build our news organization.
[02:55:09.237 --> 02:55:10.418]  And go to TrendsJournal.com.
[02:55:11.258 --> 02:55:14.419]  Am I right in saying the craziness is intensifying and I think there's a breaking point?
[02:55:14.419 --> 02:55:20.082]  Or are the psych warfare chiefs just breaking the will with a normalcy bias where people just expect anything?
[02:55:39.651 --> 02:55:41.394]  I think it's both of what you said.
[02:55:41.394 --> 02:55:47.903]  And I think there's a model for us all to follow that's really not making it very much in the American media.
[02:55:47.903 --> 02:55:49.605]  And that's what just happened in Italy.
[02:55:49.605 --> 02:55:50.146]  Yeah.
[02:55:50.146 --> 02:55:54.151]  Something that we've been following for quite some time, predicted in the Trends Journal.
[02:55:54.151 --> 02:55:54.512]  You did.
[02:55:54.512 --> 02:55:55.934]  Only country to say no to the banksters.
[02:55:57.062 --> 02:56:00.746]  Yep, and that's the Bepi Grillo's Five Star Movement.
[02:56:00.746 --> 02:56:01.827]  They call him a comedian.
[02:56:01.827 --> 02:56:03.188]  He's not a comedian.
[02:56:03.188 --> 02:56:04.450]  He's a brilliant satirist.
[02:56:04.450 --> 02:56:10.796]  You want to see a comedian, how about those buffoons out there on the presidential reality show?
[02:56:10.796 --> 02:56:14.800]  So the only big country in Europe is Italy so far.
[02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:16.242]  The bankers, Bilderberg are upset.
[02:56:16.242 --> 02:56:18.884]  The small country that did it was Iceland.
[02:56:18.884 --> 02:56:19.945]  That's the model, isn't it?
[02:56:20.626 --> 02:56:25.531]  Yes, and this is really what's interesting with Bepi Grillo's Five Star Movement.
[02:56:25.531 --> 02:56:33.519]  He never appeared on one, he refused to go on any of the TV shows with the prostitutes.
[02:56:33.519 --> 02:56:41.567]  He is the model for the internet candidate that we wrote about in the Trends Journal in December of 1999.
[02:56:43.829 --> 02:56:46.695]  He did it, remember the internet was new back then.
[02:56:46.695 --> 02:56:50.822]  We don't go on the big shows, the so-called big mainline shows anymore, most of them.
[02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:53.341]  Yeah, he wouldn't do any of it.
[02:56:53.341 --> 02:56:55.281]  He did it with Facebook.
[02:56:55.281 --> 02:56:56.762]  He did it with Twitter.
[02:56:56.762 --> 02:57:02.203]  He did it like you and like I'm doing it with our own TV broadcasts.
[02:57:02.203 --> 02:57:12.086]  He did it by going to 70, making 74 stops around the country, where hundreds of thousands of people turned out to hear him.
[02:57:12.086 --> 02:57:20.569]  He did it by galvanizing the people that were intelligent enough not to believe in the corrupt two-party system.
[02:57:21.209 --> 02:57:25.672]  Off his butt and went outside the system, build our own system, that's the answer.
[02:57:25.672 --> 02:57:26.873]  That's the answer.
[02:57:26.873 --> 02:57:33.819]  He refuses now, they can't form a government because he has so, holding so many seats.
[02:57:33.819 --> 02:57:39.463]  He refuses to deal with either of the two corrupt parties.
[02:57:39.463 --> 02:57:42.986]  He wants to bring the Eurozone and the Euro up for referendum.
[02:57:46.308 --> 02:57:46.629]  Yes!
[02:57:46.629 --> 02:57:48.453]  Let the people vote!
[02:57:48.453 --> 02:57:52.682]  Kill the euro which they brag was designed to implode countries and take them over by the banksters!
[02:57:53.601 --> 02:57:56.702]  Yes, so the model exists.
[02:57:56.702 --> 02:57:59.383]  It's the five-star movement.
[02:57:59.383 --> 02:58:02.024]  The model exists in Iceland.
[02:58:02.024 --> 02:58:13.887]  The model exists in the heart, in the mind, and the spirit of each individual that has the courage to look within themselves to find it.
[02:58:13.887 --> 02:58:16.648]  This isn't, there's nothing complicated about this.
[02:58:17.108 --> 02:58:25.677]  How could, did you see the pictures of Obama in front of that big propeller at the Virginia shipyard the other day?
[02:58:25.677 --> 02:58:26.117]  Oh yeah.
[02:58:26.117 --> 02:58:28.820]  Who could believe this stuff?
[02:58:28.820 --> 02:58:29.320]  Incredible.
[02:58:29.320 --> 02:58:31.002]  Gerald Cilente, TrendsJournal.com.
[02:58:31.002 --> 02:58:33.625]  I'm Alex Jones with PrisonPlanet.tv and Infowars.com.
[02:58:33.625 --> 02:58:35.847]  Don't forget, tonight's news, 7 o'clock.
[02:58:35.847 --> 02:58:37.468]  Thank you so much, Gerald.
[02:58:37.468 --> 02:58:38.269]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:58:38.269 --> 02:58:39.430]  Great job, Gerald Cilente.
