[00:00.000 --> 00:14.240]  So here we are ladies and gentlemen, I think we should all take stake of how many people
[00:14.240 --> 00:18.240]  the globalists have already killed and how many people they're going to kill and how
[00:18.240 --> 00:23.440]  many are already walking dead that the left is only the foot soldiers of a scientific
[00:23.440 --> 00:27.960]  corporate elite that are taking over the whole planet and preparing to bankrupt the
[00:27.960 --> 00:34.120]  world currencies on its ashes bring in their global carbon tax and their global reset.
[00:34.120 --> 00:35.120]  Can we wake Congress up?
[00:35.120 --> 00:36.560]  Can we wake the governors up?
[00:36.560 --> 00:41.040]  Because if we don't move against this, we're going to go through hellish pain.
[00:41.040 --> 00:43.200]  Already it's going to be stratospheric bad.
[00:43.200 --> 00:48.200]  A lawyer who's prominent who just pointed out and put a story out that's gone viral
[00:48.200 --> 00:56.280]  that Mike Adams expanded on it with the Pentagon's AI main AI project that was monitoring COVID-19
[00:56.280 --> 01:03.320]  worldwide, but particularly in the U.S. that was launched last April and its findings.
[01:03.320 --> 01:06.600]  When this started out according to the curve and what they're saying, you know, you had
[01:06.600 --> 01:13.240]  a really high death and hospitalization rate when COVID first came out.
[01:13.240 --> 01:16.720]  And then typically that drops off with any disease.
[01:16.720 --> 01:23.640]  Now you're seeing it really bumping back up and it's really, you know, it looks very
[01:23.640 --> 01:28.360]  much like what we were all afraid of that we'd have a massive A.D.E. type situation
[01:28.360 --> 01:33.280]  going on this fall where we had a stronger, more dangerous variant, especially for the
[01:33.280 --> 01:35.000]  people who went out and got the shot.
[01:35.000 --> 01:41.640]  And the findings are very conclusive that the individuals that have taken the mRNA injections
[01:41.640 --> 01:47.440]  that they call vaccines Pfizer and Moderna are having their immune systems erased within
[01:47.440 --> 01:56.800]  five to six months and then are developing A.D.E. and A.D.E. something you don't want.
[01:56.800 --> 02:01.480]  Because if you come in contact with any other type of cold virus, you have a violent cytokine
[02:01.480 --> 02:03.920]  storm and generally die.
[02:03.920 --> 02:08.920]  And when they see this happen, they're claiming it's COVID killing you and they're blaming
[02:08.920 --> 02:09.920]  the unvaccinated.
[02:09.920 --> 02:16.640]  Well, first of all, Alex, this is OSINT or open source intelligence, but this is DOD.
[02:16.640 --> 02:20.520]  This is their JAIC, their artificial intelligence program.
[02:20.520 --> 02:23.280]  So no one can argue that this is not some secret source somewhere.
[02:23.280 --> 02:25.040]  This is open source intelligence.
[02:25.040 --> 02:28.280]  What it shows a couple of very important things.
[02:28.280 --> 02:35.880]  One is that the negative side effects from the vaccine get worse over time with each
[02:35.880 --> 02:37.800]  passing week.
[02:37.800 --> 02:43.920]  And so the negative outcomes, which includes hospitalizations and ICU outcomes, as well
[02:43.920 --> 02:49.200]  as deaths, it's very bad at three to four months, but it roughly doubles in about six
[02:49.200 --> 02:50.200]  months.
[02:50.200 --> 02:52.640]  Now, this looks like a flat line projection.
[02:52.640 --> 02:57.560]  So if we continue to project this out further in time to, let's say, nine months or 12 months,
[02:57.560 --> 03:01.640]  which is coming up in our immediate future, this is my estimation.
[03:01.640 --> 03:02.640]  This is not in the report.
[03:02.640 --> 03:07.960]  But by my estimation, we're going to see millions of Americans suffering severe hospitalizations
[03:07.960 --> 03:12.400]  and deaths over the next six months if you plan to get vaccinated.
[03:12.400 --> 03:16.920]  According to these data put out by the DOD, the number one thing that you can do to survive
[03:16.920 --> 03:21.440]  the vaccine is to get COVID before you take the vaccine.
[03:21.440 --> 03:22.440]  That's in the data.
[03:22.440 --> 03:25.120]  But also notice the last slide of this slide 17.
[03:25.120 --> 03:29.000]  It also shows the ethnic groups that are most affected by this.
[03:29.000 --> 03:30.000]  That's slide 17.
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.560]  And it shows that Native Americans have the highest rate of increase odds of negative outcomes.
[03:36.560 --> 03:40.360]  So if you're Native American and you're getting this vaccine, you have about a 1.5 times higher
[03:40.360 --> 03:44.400]  risk of death and negative side effects compared to Caucasians.
[03:44.400 --> 03:49.160]  If you're Hispanic, it's about a roughly 1.3 to 1.4 times greater odds.
[03:49.160 --> 03:54.080]  If you're black, it's something more like 1.25 roughly in that range.
[03:54.080 --> 04:00.920]  But the point is, this vaccine has ethnic effects that, you know, there have been many
[04:00.920 --> 04:06.440]  people out there warning about the possibility of this vaccine being a biological weapon.
[04:06.440 --> 04:10.680]  For example, Lewis Farrakhan warning about this, and I have to say whether or not you
[04:10.680 --> 04:17.080]  agree with Lewis Farrakhan on other things, this theory is plausible based on these data.
[04:17.080 --> 04:26.240]  They give you free shots of toxic waste.
[04:26.240 --> 04:27.680]  You own a death watch.
[04:27.680 --> 04:33.640]  If you don't understand it, you're not going to be here to do all the wonderful things
[04:33.640 --> 04:34.640]  you talked about.
[04:34.640 --> 04:40.440]  Remember the EcoHealth Alliance proposal to DARPA and the coverage of that by Drastic,
[04:40.440 --> 04:45.680]  that organization, and they confirmed there were hundreds of variants of SARS-CoV-2 that
[04:45.680 --> 04:50.880]  had been created through the NIH Fauci funding of that whole operation.
[04:50.880 --> 04:58.600]  So folks, this has only just begun.
[04:58.600 --> 05:05.280]  So the placebo that they have used, that the FDA has allowed them to use, has often been
[05:05.280 --> 05:10.840]  another vaccine, a vaccine with a known adverse reaction profile that's causing death and
[05:10.840 --> 05:13.200]  damage in its own right.
[05:13.200 --> 05:20.360]  That it's the aluminum as an adjuvant in the vaccine, a known neurotoxin, a known immunotoxin,
[05:20.360 --> 05:26.920]  a known poison in human beings that is in the supposedly inert placebo, totally inappropriate.
[05:26.920 --> 05:28.680]  This is not good science.
[05:28.680 --> 05:31.200]  It is not science at all.
[05:31.200 --> 05:36.360]  It is an effort to cover up the true adverse reaction rates to these vaccines so that they
[05:36.360 --> 05:43.280]  can get through the low barrier of constraints put there by the FDA and onto the market.
[05:43.280 --> 05:44.280]  That is the only concern.
[05:44.280 --> 05:49.600]  Dr. Wakefield is just one of many informed voices in the film, COVID Land.

[06:26.760 --> 06:32.600]  We are living in historic times.
[06:32.600 --> 06:37.480]  We are living at the crossroads of human destiny.
[06:37.480 --> 06:43.080]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Wednesday, October 6th, Worldwide Transmission.
[06:43.080 --> 06:48.520]  I'll be hosting four hours of the broadcast today and we have cleared the deck of guests
[06:48.520 --> 06:54.840]  so we can take your phone calls and cover the incredible amounts of news.
[06:54.840 --> 06:55.840]  Okay.
[06:55.840 --> 06:59.720]  It's now official that they're getting rid of all the major world currencies very soon
[06:59.720 --> 07:03.200]  and creating a worldwide digital UN world government currency.
[07:03.200 --> 07:08.320]  And any wars that start are going to be over the three major global power blocks fighting
[07:08.320 --> 07:10.960]  over who's going to be dominant in that system.
[07:10.960 --> 07:15.840]  We have that huge stack of critical, great reset news and that's why they're launching
[07:15.840 --> 07:21.040]  all the different things you see and the bio weapon war to so distract us and to moralize
[07:21.040 --> 07:26.640]  us and put a police state grid in place so that we will accept the new global cashless
[07:26.640 --> 07:32.480]  society based on the COVID-19 vaccine passports that will then be the global carbon passport,
[07:32.480 --> 07:36.000]  the tracks and traces and taxes, everything you do and decides where you can go and what
[07:36.000 --> 07:40.360]  you can do at a level never before even dreamed of until now.
[07:40.360 --> 07:41.520]  That is one stack.
[07:41.520 --> 07:44.560]  Then, thank God it's starting to happen.
[07:44.560 --> 07:45.560]  Documents are now out.
[07:45.560 --> 07:46.560]  It's mainstream news.
[07:46.560 --> 07:47.560]  I've got a whole stack on that.
[07:47.560 --> 07:51.280]  The NIH director, Francis Collins, resigns at the Documents for Heel.
[07:51.280 --> 07:55.680]  He lied about his involvement with gain of function research at Wuhan lab, specifically
[07:55.680 --> 08:02.120]  with Fauci and Peter Dazek creating COVID-19 and having a plan to spray it open air on
[08:02.120 --> 08:03.280]  the Chinese people.
[08:03.280 --> 08:04.680]  That's all mainstream news.
[08:04.680 --> 08:07.320]  That is just devastating bombshell news.
[08:07.320 --> 08:12.280]  And then we've got Senator Rick Scott of Florida introduces legislation to block interstate
[08:12.280 --> 08:16.600]  travel checkpoints that Biden regime is now preparing to publicly announce.
[08:16.600 --> 08:18.000]  They've already said they're going to do it.
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.560]  And if you think that's bad, look at Australia, Australia being mandated to provide police
[08:23.560 --> 08:27.240]  with geotrackable selfies to prove they're quarantining.
[08:27.240 --> 08:31.560]  And that's the new vaccine passport, the model of the entire planet.
[08:31.560 --> 08:34.160]  Hospital systems say they're going to deny you healthcare if you don't take the deadly
[08:34.160 --> 08:35.160]  shots.
[08:35.160 --> 08:37.440]  This is beyond Nuremberg code violations.
[08:37.440 --> 08:43.120]  This is complete criminal medical tyranny, stampeding civilization.
[08:43.120 --> 08:45.320]  Then we've got this in all ties together.
[08:45.320 --> 08:52.640]  In June, I mean, Biden had been in office a week and I was on vacation with my family,
[08:52.640 --> 08:56.240]  a workcation in Utah and Park City.
[08:56.240 --> 08:58.240]  And I remember coming on the show and playing clips of it.
[08:58.240 --> 09:03.960]  I host the show from there where they had Saki and they had Biden and they had the head
[09:03.960 --> 09:08.000]  of the Justice Department and the head of the FBI all in press conferences saying the
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.800]  number one threat is those that question elections.
[09:11.800 --> 09:17.920]  And the number two threat isn't just those that question elections.
[09:17.920 --> 09:24.320]  It is anyone that doesn't want to be locked down during a, quote, lockdown.
[09:24.320 --> 09:31.640]  And then in June, they put out the national strategy for countering domestic terrorism.
[09:31.640 --> 09:33.320]  And it says all of that and more.
[09:33.320 --> 09:36.720]  Just questioning the government is now terrorism.
[09:36.720 --> 09:40.400]  If you fight back against Antifa or leftists attacking you, that's terrorism.
[09:40.400 --> 09:43.120]  If you're Rand Paul and don't like getting shot at, that's terrorism.
[09:43.120 --> 09:46.880]  You don't like your ribs being broken, that's terrorism.
[09:46.880 --> 09:51.400]  And that's why I told you this is the declaration of war by the globalist against us.
[09:51.400 --> 09:52.400]  They're not Americans.
[09:52.400 --> 09:56.760]  The Democratic Party works for the globalist crime syndicate.
[09:56.760 --> 10:00.520]  And they're just introducing the idea that we're all criminals, that we live under martial
[10:00.520 --> 10:01.520]  law.
[10:01.520 --> 10:05.280]  So of course, the National Association of School Boards comes out and of course the
[10:05.280 --> 10:07.720]  National Association of Teachers comes out.
[10:07.720 --> 10:12.480]  That's the on the boots on the ground federal globalist takeover system and says, and we've
[10:12.480 --> 10:13.480]  got the quotes.
[10:13.480 --> 10:14.480]  We've got the videos.
[10:14.480 --> 10:20.040]  We've got the letter from the so-called attorney general, wild-eyed globalist maniac, that
[10:20.040 --> 10:26.360]  it's terrorism to raise your voice or yell at people at a school board meeting.
[10:26.360 --> 10:29.640]  Or if you don't want your child to wear a mask or if you don't want forced inoculations
[10:29.640 --> 10:33.840]  or if you don't like your school teaching that white people are inherently evil and
[10:33.840 --> 10:39.280]  have an original sin and must pay a special tax because of who they are.
[10:39.280 --> 10:43.880]  That is in the actual letter and now they're sending out FBI on the news looking for people
[10:43.880 --> 10:44.880]  they can arrest.
[10:44.880 --> 10:49.200]  They'll probably arrest some provocateurs that'll just be informants that pose for the arrest.
[10:49.200 --> 10:55.320]  We catch the FBI doing that all the time and that that will be used to create fear and
[10:55.320 --> 10:56.320]  more division.
[10:56.320 --> 10:58.440]  But this is all part of the globalist takeover.
[10:58.440 --> 11:00.640]  They've hit us with a bio weapon.
[11:00.640 --> 11:06.440]  They're denying us cures and treatments that they know are basically 99 to 100 percent.
[11:06.440 --> 11:07.600]  They've flooded the borders.
[11:07.600 --> 11:08.600]  They've imploded the nation.
[11:08.600 --> 11:10.000]  They don't believe the country should exist.
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.880]  The National Archives has said the Declaration of Independence Bill of Rights Constitution
[11:13.880 --> 11:17.000]  is racist and has put trigger warnings on it.
[11:17.000 --> 11:22.600]  The very essence of the country is being abolished with a multinational murderous takeover of
[11:22.600 --> 11:28.120]  current corporations running slave camps in Africa, China, and other areas who are then
[11:28.120 --> 11:32.160]  funding critical race theory to distract from what they're doing and divide and conquer
[11:32.160 --> 11:33.160]  us.
[11:33.160 --> 11:40.040]  We have all of that today and that's just four of the stacks.
[11:40.040 --> 11:51.520]  Then we have LGBT movement is now called 2SLGBTQQAI+, sorry I said it wrong, you misidentify
[11:51.520 --> 11:52.520]  you go to jail in California.
[11:52.520 --> 11:53.520]  Let me say it right.
[11:53.520 --> 12:00.160]  It is now 2SLGBTQQIA+.
[12:00.160 --> 12:03.040]  That's cult programming, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:03.040 --> 12:04.600]  It's meant to sound ridiculous.
[12:04.600 --> 12:05.600]  Wear a mask.
[12:05.600 --> 12:06.600]  Don't go outside.
[12:06.600 --> 12:07.600]  Don't look people in the eyes.
[12:07.600 --> 12:09.880]  Don't look at the sunset.
[12:09.880 --> 12:11.240]  Don't talk to your neighbors.
[12:11.240 --> 12:13.200]  This is all being done in Canada and all over.
[12:13.200 --> 12:14.200]  It's coming here now.
[12:14.200 --> 12:17.600]  It's to see when they say jump how high will you jump.
[12:17.600 --> 12:19.520]  You'll ask how high.
[12:19.520 --> 12:24.880]  It's cult programming like the board took over and this is the new language.
[12:24.880 --> 12:32.600]  Like 1984, everybody talks in double plus good Q79438 that so that it's not real language.
[12:32.600 --> 12:36.000]  It's all just weird, bizarre computer sounding slogans.
[12:36.000 --> 12:37.640]  This is behavioral psychology.
[12:37.640 --> 12:48.920]  This is brainwashing and they know it.
[12:48.920 --> 12:56.160]  And just women shaving their heads and stinking and saying I stink and love to be ugly and
[12:56.160 --> 12:57.160]  I'm lazy.
[12:57.160 --> 12:59.640]  I'll do nothing.
[12:59.640 --> 13:05.840]  This is all designed to rest in development as they prepare to implode the society for
[13:05.840 --> 13:06.840]  the mass culling.
[13:06.840 --> 13:16.240]  They invoke the spiritual malaise, the spiritual decadence so that we become the animal creatures
[13:16.240 --> 13:19.960]  they say we are that can then be destroyed.
[13:19.960 --> 13:25.160]  We are at the great moment of truth and archetypally we have the perfect puppet president who stole
[13:25.160 --> 13:29.080]  his way into the election who can't even talk now and there's video on info wars.com
[13:29.080 --> 13:33.600]  and we'll play it coming up of John Kerry in France saying he doesn't know anything.
[13:33.600 --> 13:35.120]  He doesn't know what happened.
[13:35.120 --> 13:36.520]  He's not really at home anymore.
[13:36.520 --> 13:37.680]  So we're sorry.
[13:37.680 --> 13:40.480]  The perfect excuse that oh, it's mismanagement.
[13:40.480 --> 13:44.120]  That's why we screwed you over on the submarines, which is all pure bull.
[13:44.120 --> 13:45.840]  Who's running the show?
[13:45.840 --> 13:53.600]  Kerry tells French TV that Biden's literally quote not aware, literally not aware of international
[13:53.600 --> 14:01.480]  crisis and then separately because of supply chain breakdowns it's been sold out for six
[14:01.480 --> 14:07.080]  plus months and it is now ladies and gentlemen back in stock.
[14:07.080 --> 14:08.360]  We will not cut the quality.
[14:08.360 --> 14:12.640]  We will not downgrade what we've got and so we could have already downgraded the quality
[14:12.640 --> 14:13.640]  and got this in a month.
[14:13.640 --> 14:19.320]  We didn't six plus months later DNA force plus with the PQQ the CoQ 10 you're not going
[14:19.320 --> 14:23.240]  to find anything out there near this price for this quality.
[14:23.240 --> 14:24.800]  This is the best stuff you're going to find.
[14:24.800 --> 14:27.920]  It's got EL EV ATP.
[14:27.920 --> 14:35.360]  It's got PQQ CoQ 10 organic reishi astragalus root extract and a bunch of other key ingredients

[20:10.720 --> 20:24.160]  news
[20:24.160 --> 20:30.800]  Wednesday October 6th 2021 bad news is globalist depopulationists have seized control of the
[20:30.800 --> 20:37.400]  world's resources and are trying to carry out a collapse to which they pose as the saviors
[20:37.400 --> 20:41.600]  where at every level they get more power and control they just tighten up the news around
[20:41.600 --> 20:46.160]  our next incremental enslavement the good news is humanity is waking up to it and figuring
[20:46.160 --> 20:52.720]  it out and beginning to organize against it and here's a new email being sent out by
[20:52.720 --> 20:58.640]  CNN it's on their front page by Sanjay Gupta I have bad news for you we're stuck with this
[20:58.640 --> 21:03.720]  novel coronavirus in our environment perhaps indefinitely and there might be another more
[21:03.720 --> 21:09.920]  deadly and contagious pathogen right behind it well we actually know that you show people
[21:09.920 --> 21:15.600]  a shot of that place we we we know that because Fauci made a whole bunch of them and it's
[21:15.600 --> 21:20.760]  in the documents that he even gave the Pentagon that have come out and that's why the director
[21:20.760 --> 21:26.480]  of the NIH had to resign that's coming up next segment but who in operation lockstep in the
[21:26.480 --> 21:31.880]  Rockefeller Foundation who is in control of this well a handful of private families mainly
[21:31.880 --> 21:37.080]  European banking families and royalty along with the Rockefellers here in a handful of
[21:37.080 --> 21:45.560]  families like the air to one of the most powerful and that of course is Anderson Cooper or the
[21:45.560 --> 21:49.760]  richest man in the world but he you Google his wealth says he has no money that's how
[21:49.760 --> 21:55.160]  rich he is he quote has no money and he's the heir to some of the biggest families in the
[21:55.160 --> 22:00.720]  country who all intermarried he's not just he's not just with the Vanderbilt's but the
[22:00.720 --> 22:06.240]  Asters and all the rest of it and the Rockefellers so it's all one big family and they're waging
[22:06.240 --> 22:11.720]  war on us they released HIV and they release Ebola weaponized and they've now released
[22:11.720 --> 22:16.760]  this it's all it's all come out but what's the end game well depopulation of at least
[22:16.760 --> 22:22.400]  90% of us in their own public documents but to get there again they have to create crises
[22:22.400 --> 22:27.640]  stage crises organize a collapse to then get a global cashless society tied to your vaccine
[22:27.640 --> 22:32.240]  passport which will then be your carbon passport in their own words tell you where you can go
[22:32.240 --> 22:36.320]  what you can do this is this is everything this is being announced all over the world
[22:36.320 --> 22:40.560]  all over TV now it's not just Alex Jones telling you 20 years ago and then once they've got
[22:40.560 --> 22:46.400]  that they can social engineer you even more and then accelerate the cutting off the resources
[22:46.400 --> 22:53.440]  outlawing most beef production family farms you name it just total feudalism make you poor
[22:53.440 --> 23:00.880]  to make you die under some of the headlines unrelenting political brink ship edges US closer
[23:00.880 --> 23:08.080]  to default Bloomberg trillion dollar platinum coin could be minted at the last minute Democrats
[23:08.080 --> 23:11.560]  say and they again the head of the budget committee says the government can make all
[23:11.560 --> 23:17.640]  the money they want sounds like Zimbabwe international shipping group issues red alert letter warning
[23:17.640 --> 23:23.200]  of imminent global supply chain collapse widespread famine power grid failures and economic ruin
[23:23.200 --> 23:27.880]  are right around the corner that's what they're saying it's all the great reset ladies and
[23:27.880 --> 23:36.320]  gentlemen it's all the great reset in your face taking us to the point of the Zimbabwean
[23:36.320 --> 23:40.440]  dollar we're going to lay all this out in more next segment but the heart of it is these
[23:40.440 --> 23:44.040]  private bankers that get the world through fraud but they got a bankrupt everything
[23:44.040 --> 23:48.760]  now to make you have to take their universal income that is their global fraud instead
[23:48.760 --> 23:53.360]  of going to jail like Bernie Madoff they've done something thousands of times bigger they
[23:53.360 --> 23:56.960]  get the whole world because they buy up the media they buy up the politicians they buy
[23:56.960 --> 24:01.040]  up the infrastructure they buy up all the major companies basically for five times what
[24:01.040 --> 24:04.840]  they're worth because they have all the fiat money and then they just turn off most of
[24:04.840 --> 24:10.280]  those companies to create the collapse and then vertically integrate what's left into
[24:10.280 --> 24:14.600]  the few major combines that are going to make you face scan and have a vaccine passport
[24:14.600 --> 24:20.800]  like Walmart and Canada and Amazon Whole Foods in Canada to make you again be able to eat
[24:20.800 --> 24:26.520]  food this is the plan this is their operation and it's not me telling you 28 years ago it's
[24:26.520 --> 24:32.840]  here you're living it you're being fed into the woodchipper you're being fed into the
[24:32.840 --> 24:41.040]  fire your feet are now in it and you're moving fast down it there's the report it's live on
[24:41.040 --> 24:44.840]  banned out video I suggest you share it it hits the nail on the head from Gregory's the
[24:44.840 --> 24:50.240]  big banks are guilty of crimes against humanity the big banks are quarterbacking our destruction
[24:50.240 --> 25:04.280]  at this point anyone who isn't an imbecile or mentally disturbed has figured out that
[25:04.280 --> 25:12.320]  COVID-19 is the biggest fraud of our lifetime several nations figured this out months ago
[25:12.320 --> 25:19.200]  and have mandated the life-saving ivermectin protocol with consistently outstanding results
[25:19.200 --> 25:24.360]  multiple countries distributed packets to all of their citizens with everything they
[25:24.360 --> 25:34.880]  need to survive the asymptomatic virus with an already 99% survival rate known as SARS-CoV-2
[25:34.880 --> 25:41.560]  Denmark Sweden and Norway have completely reopened and are ready to accept life with
[25:41.560 --> 25:49.640]  this novel asymptomatic virus with a 99% survival rate and Japan is moving on as well but not
[25:49.640 --> 25:59.640]  Australia not the UK not Canada and certainly not the USA where today's global currency
[25:59.640 --> 26:05.880]  is being printed by the privately owned Federal Reserve Banking System the spearhead of this
[26:05.880 --> 26:12.840]  great reset only nations with vibrant free markets and cultures that still value independent
[26:12.840 --> 26:18.400]  freedoms are being targeted by the globalist elite who instruct their loyal minions to
[26:18.400 --> 26:25.160]  push endless deadly experimental injections and denounce any and all life-saving solutions
[26:25.160 --> 26:34.080]  such as ivermectin vitamin C and even natural immunity they want death because they want
[26:34.080 --> 26:40.680]  to mandate a vaccine they want to mandate a vaccine because they want a social credit
[26:40.680 --> 26:46.960]  score and they want a social credit score because they are planning on resetting the
[26:46.960 --> 26:53.200]  global currency to the digital blockchain what millions of people in these western nations
[26:53.200 --> 27:00.200]  under attack would call the mark of the beast known today as the Chinese social credit system
[27:00.200 --> 27:07.320]  wherein each citizen is completely reliant upon the government absolute tyranny there
[27:07.320 --> 27:13.720]  is no global pandemic and the only virus that threatens humanity is the big banks their
[27:13.720 --> 27:21.120]  offshoots and whomever or whatever they serve this is quite simply the parasitic top of
[27:21.120 --> 27:27.520]  the global pyramid feeding off all of humanity a former Vatican bank president has recently
[27:27.520 --> 27:33.720]  warned that the COVID pandemic is nothing but a fraud to bring in the great reset we
[27:33.720 --> 27:40.520]  reported that this was the case back in March of 2020 because it's happened before and now
[27:40.520 --> 27:47.520]  unless we stop them it's going to happen again biden's nominee for comptroller of the currency
[27:47.520 --> 27:54.760]  sally omarova is a proud communist who wants to end banking as we know it the worldwide
[27:54.760 --> 28:01.360]  banking cartel who gets rich off the fractional reserve banking scam and by charging interest
[28:01.360 --> 28:07.360]  on loaning people their own resources has no problem exterminating anyone opposed to
[28:07.360 --> 28:15.480]  their great reset agenda to the big banks we are all livestock chattel this is greed
[28:15.480 --> 28:22.800]  on its most realized level they're passing laws to restrict travel and to seize private
[28:22.800 --> 28:29.680]  property police and military not willing to go along are being forced out via vaccine
[28:29.680 --> 28:37.360]  mandates and nurses not going along are being replaced by the military the system has already
[28:37.360 --> 28:43.720]  been hijacked no one is coming to save you the only way out of this mess without losing
[28:43.720 --> 28:51.960]  everything that's worth fighting for is for humanity to stand up and say no for info wars

[31:02.880 --> 31:09.120]  key to understanding our world it's very very simple but the most people don't know the privately
[31:09.120 --> 31:14.600]  owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars
[31:14.600 --> 31:22.240]  and other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure intellectual property
[31:22.240 --> 31:28.440]  energy they're using it to buy people to buy influence and in the past they created thousands
[31:28.440 --> 31:32.560]  of trillions so that they could leverage that manipulate markets but they never allowed
[31:32.560 --> 31:37.800]  that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation now they've
[31:37.800 --> 31:42.680]  gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy buying up
[31:42.680 --> 31:48.440]  everything not to have the companies operate but to actually shut them down and force the
[31:48.440 --> 31:53.240]  collapse of civilization making the companies they do fund the only things left standing
[31:53.240 --> 31:57.600]  this is the great reset this is what's happening now warn everyone it's the only way to stop
[31:57.600 --> 32:03.720]  it it was almost 15 years ago that i've released my seminal film in game blueprint for global
[32:03.720 --> 32:09.400]  enslavement and in that documentary i predicted the globalist would establish world government
[32:09.400 --> 32:14.760]  are releasing a virus demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns and then triggering
[32:14.760 --> 32:19.680]  a collapse of our industrial society and now they've done it how did i know they would
[32:19.680 --> 32:24.840]  do it because they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and internal
[32:24.840 --> 32:30.000]  meetings were leaked you see then i was tracking the bilderberg group whose head at the time
[32:30.000 --> 32:35.440]  was claus schwa and our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch
[32:35.440 --> 32:40.000]  this great reset well we're now living in it the purposeful collapse of the third world
[32:40.000 --> 32:45.320]  and the first world done its actions the tyrannical corporate world government the total censorship
[32:45.320 --> 32:51.720]  no due process destruction of the family and then incrementally more and more deadly injections
[32:51.720 --> 32:56.720]  of poison mass creating these vaccines to poison us and depopulate us this is what info wars
[32:56.720 --> 33:04.040]  is fighting we're fighting for the future you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:04.040 --> 33:30.600]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen i'm gonna keep cover the news the rest of this hour
[33:30.600 --> 33:36.920]  interspersed with other huge news and breaking news throughout the next three hours after
[33:36.920 --> 33:41.800]  that and i'll open the phones up for hour two three and four there's been a shooting
[33:41.800 --> 33:47.000]  in a texas high school it's a top story everywhere they don't have a lot of details yet but again
[33:47.000 --> 33:51.800]  when two or three people get shot it's international news all gun owners are at fault but when hundreds
[33:51.800 --> 33:56.600]  of thousands are killed a year in mexico barely a blip when hundreds of thousands are missing
[33:56.600 --> 34:01.760]  many of them caught tortured murdered on the texas border by the mexican coyotes almost
[34:01.760 --> 34:11.400]  not a word so it's we've got a lockdown in texas school amid reports of a shooting and
[34:11.400 --> 34:15.120]  it's the end of the world four injured in high school shooting in arlington texas we
[34:15.120 --> 34:18.880]  will have something for you on that next segment i'm gonna tie it into what's happening in
[34:18.880 --> 34:23.120]  mexico and how people don't care about that but how they hype up mass shootings i actually
[34:23.120 --> 34:29.200]  had that in my stack today this stack right here was already about how they hype up mass
[34:29.200 --> 34:32.880]  shootings they hype up every once in a while and some racist white person goes and shoots
[34:32.880 --> 34:36.920]  some black people but when it's brown people killing brown people or this black on black
[34:36.920 --> 34:43.360]  or hispanic on hispanic it's like not like it's hundreds to one what whites do hispanics
[34:43.360 --> 34:49.800]  kill hispanics blacks kill blacks whites kill whites that's why criminology works it's insane
[34:49.800 --> 34:53.680]  i'm gonna cover those numbers in fact we'll do it next segment but let me get back to
[34:53.680 --> 35:03.040]  where we were with the great reset you just saw greg reese's report the big banks are
[35:03.040 --> 35:07.000]  guilty of crimes against humanity it's at man dot video in the greg reese section will
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.640]  make it the featured video everybody needs to get it they need to share it it just went
[35:11.640 --> 35:17.120]  live you can also share it from news wars dot com the big banks are guilty of crimes
[35:17.120 --> 35:20.720]  against humanity but you notice partway into the film or partway into the little four minute
[35:20.720 --> 35:29.600]  report he shows a screenshot of early march 2020 saying that covid 19 is going to be for
[35:29.600 --> 35:36.160]  the great reset of the un world economic forum to collapse the society well here it is right
[35:36.160 --> 35:40.400]  here in claus wab's great reset that came out months and months and months and months
[35:40.400 --> 35:45.920]  after greg and i put out that report i didn't research on it as well i've done about credit
[35:45.920 --> 35:50.160]  it's about us know what we're talking about and he says this book is being published and
[35:50.160 --> 35:58.880]  going to print in july of 2020 and he brags how avant-garde it is they had this already
[35:58.880 --> 36:02.480]  pre-planned so notice we're already saying this is going to be the great reset they're
[36:02.480 --> 36:06.440]  going to use this to bring in carbon taxes before he even came out and said it because
[36:06.440 --> 36:12.240]  that's how much we watch them it's how much we are on them and again if you go to that
[36:12.240 --> 36:17.120]  report just fast forward through it you'll see a screenshot in there where you can find
[36:17.120 --> 36:22.080]  the greg reese report on the great reset or you simply go to man dot video click on the
[36:22.080 --> 36:27.000]  left hand tab find the greg reese area you go down till you find the greg reese video
[36:27.000 --> 36:33.760]  the perfect storm for a global currency reset only a hundred and thirty five thousand hundred
[36:33.760 --> 36:44.000]  thirty six thousand views that needs ten million views we could turn the world around we could
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.480]  turn the world around if people like joe roganon on his instagram would put that out and get
[36:49.480 --> 36:56.000]  ten million views but joe's put some of what i'm saying now what did joe put out about
[36:56.000 --> 37:03.640]  nine ten months ago when i was on a show last well i said that the majority of people getting
[37:03.640 --> 37:08.600]  polio worldwide are getting it from bill gates' vaccines and they said joe was a liar they
[37:08.600 --> 37:13.840]  said i was a liar but on the show i pulled up reuters saying it and i pulled up clips
[37:13.840 --> 37:25.200]  they said i was lying about where bill gates came out and said that he wants to basically
[37:25.200 --> 37:33.480]  depopulate the planet and of course other clips where bill gates says that he wants to
[37:33.480 --> 37:38.720]  give us all of these quote booster shots in the future and that eighty percent of the
[37:38.720 --> 37:45.200]  people that take the vaccine in the early emergency trials they were doing last year
[37:45.200 --> 37:49.840]  were getting serious side effects now those were all quotes out of bill gates' own mouth
[37:49.840 --> 37:53.920]  admitting it hiding in plain view they said i was lying but then joe put out a little
[37:53.920 --> 38:01.200]  three minute instagram with him saying and we're gonna actually do that next segment
[38:01.200 --> 38:06.680]  that's another one of my stacks i've got right here the next hour i'll get into the whole
[38:06.680 --> 38:11.360]  so-called school shootings and them saying those are the biggest events in history and
[38:11.360 --> 38:14.800]  all gunners are to blame while they ignore all the real crime and real carnage not just
[38:14.800 --> 38:21.520]  here but around the world but here it is in my stack to go over next segment bill gates
[38:21.520 --> 38:26.480]  said healthcare and vaccines could reduce unsustainable population growth in 2010 ted
[38:26.480 --> 38:33.880]  talk fact checkers say that well he did say it but he didn't exactly mean it bill gates
[38:33.880 --> 38:38.240]  never said three million people need to die well not not that exact quote that's out of
[38:38.240 --> 38:48.040]  associated press so what they do is they build straw man of what we didn't say and then claim
[38:48.040 --> 38:54.080]  it's false and bill gates wants us all live happily ever after well let me show TV viewers
[38:54.080 --> 38:59.840]  getting very very important we'll get to this next segment here's bill gates in a detailed

[43:04.520 --> 43:09.800]  now openly announcing the mark of the beast everything that it's attempting to do is built
[43:09.800 --> 43:15.760]  around getting rid of our free will and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies
[43:15.760 --> 43:24.440]  our very productivity our very genetics our very future over to them they want control
[43:24.440 --> 43:29.600]  of procreation they want control of the relationships between men and women they want to bring a
[43:29.600 --> 43:36.000]  form of living death to our society and our civilization all of us were formed and made
[43:36.000 --> 43:41.120]  in God's mind and God's image and given free will and make no mistake all of you alive

[44:14.840 --> 44:22.000]  strongest sleep aid that we have I would say knockout rocket rest both great comes in pill
[44:22.000 --> 44:27.280]  form this is the liquid tincture and I think this is probably the most powerful one survival
[44:27.280 --> 44:32.400]  shield x2 nascent iodine this is if you haven't done an iodine challenge yet have you haven't
[44:32.400 --> 44:37.480]  done the iodine challenge what are you waiting for now is the time super male and super female
[44:37.480 --> 44:43.520]  vitality living defense plus and the organic greens fiber caps we have a limited supply
[44:43.520 --> 44:47.560]  of these right now but we want to sell them all out so we can order a new batch it was
[44:47.560 --> 44:52.120]  very popular the organic green fiber caps but we have all kinds of other great supplements
[44:52.120 --> 44:58.720]  that are great for so many different things take advantage of those.
[44:58.720 --> 45:05.600]  So if you understand that this is not FDA approved it's totally experimental it's never been
[45:05.600 --> 45:12.680]  given to human beings before some of the ingredients inside of these of these shots have never
[45:12.680 --> 45:18.520]  been injected in human beings before there are no long term studies we don't know what
[45:18.520 --> 45:23.680]  is going to happen inside your body somewhere four to six weeks after your second injection
[45:23.680 --> 45:31.240]  or four to six months or even two years we have no idea whether it's going to cause infertility
[45:31.240 --> 45:36.080]  whether it's going to cause cancer how bad your autoimmune disease is going to be.
[45:36.080 --> 45:39.760]  My conclusion after looking at this for a long time and listening to the arguments for
[45:39.760 --> 45:44.680]  these masks I've determined that if you believe if you're a medical doctor or a scientist
[45:44.680 --> 45:49.960]  that is spouting using these masks you're either being played or you're being paid.

[45:54.880 --> 46:01.120]  copy of in game blueprint for global enslavement so when I first started taking survival skills
[46:01.120 --> 46:06.280]  basically I was 275 pounds overweight I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was
[46:06.280 --> 46:10.760]  barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it so the
[46:10.760 --> 46:15.160]  first one I got was the original survival skills the X1 and it worked pretty good and
[46:15.160 --> 46:19.040]  then shortly thereafter you came out with that you know with a deep burden source you
[46:19.040 --> 46:23.160]  know and I got really excited about that so I took it and man in two weeks I went from
[46:23.160 --> 46:28.760]  brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know I could think again
[46:28.760 --> 46:33.720]  I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years I got
[46:33.720 --> 46:38.440]  my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements they're all absolutely
[46:38.440 --> 46:42.600]  amazing supplements the one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to
[46:42.600 --> 46:46.600]  sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get
[46:46.600 --> 46:50.840]  ourselves clean that's a break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that
[46:50.840 --> 46:55.560]  is to take our own health into our own hands beautifully said brother I thank you so much
[46:55.560 --> 47:01.680]  for your call and Godspeed
[47:01.680 --> 47:22.520]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show

[47:53.640 --> 47:58.640]  Ain't gonna see more damage done
[47:58.640 --> 48:03.640]  Sweet talking of people that are in me out of town
[48:03.640 --> 48:05.640]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Alex Jones show
[48:05.640 --> 48:08.640]  We're gonna hit the hardcore information right now
[48:08.640 --> 48:11.640]  So one of the kingpins of global government depopulation
[48:11.640 --> 48:13.640]  Who works the Rockefeller Foundation
[48:13.640 --> 48:15.640]  And his mother worked for the Rockefeller Foundation
[48:15.640 --> 48:17.640]  And IBM Foundation
[48:17.640 --> 48:20.640]  To carry out the beliefs of John D Rockefeller
[48:20.640 --> 48:22.640]  The first and his children
[48:22.640 --> 48:24.640]  And of course, Thomas Watson of IBM
[48:24.640 --> 48:26.640]  Who was the top advisor to Hitler
[48:26.640 --> 48:28.640]  Won the highest award in Nazi Germany
[48:28.640 --> 48:32.640]  Even above awards that Hitler, Hermann Göring, Heinrich Himmler
[48:32.640 --> 48:34.640]  And others got
[48:34.640 --> 48:38.640]  Established a global consortium of tax-free foundations
[48:38.640 --> 48:42.640]  That have quadrillions in dollars today via their fraud
[48:42.640 --> 48:46.640]  Via their fractional reserve banking and derivatives
[48:46.640 --> 48:50.640]  And so they own hundreds of times all the real wealth in the world
[48:50.640 --> 48:52.640]  Via fraud
[48:52.640 --> 48:55.640]  And now they're shutting down the world economy in the great reset
[48:55.640 --> 48:59.640]  In their own words to quote cut off the carbon and depopulate
[48:59.640 --> 49:03.640]  So they've got a big push
[49:03.640 --> 49:07.640]  From AP Reuters, People Magazine, CNN
[49:07.640 --> 49:10.640]  Wall Street Journal, New York Times
[49:10.640 --> 49:14.640]  Saying Bill Gates wants you to live, he wants you to be healthy
[49:14.640 --> 49:16.640]  Yeah, he's involved in vaccine programs worldwide
[49:16.640 --> 49:18.640]  He loves you
[49:18.640 --> 49:21.640]  And he never said he wants to reduce population
[49:21.640 --> 49:23.640]  Not on Bill Moyer's 20 years ago
[49:23.640 --> 49:25.640]  Not his dad running Planned Parenthood
[49:25.640 --> 49:26.640]  None of it
[49:26.640 --> 49:28.640]  He didn't say any of that
[49:28.640 --> 49:29.640]  Here it is
[49:29.640 --> 49:31.640]  Bill Gates said healthcare and vaccines could reduce
[49:31.640 --> 49:35.640]  Unsustainable population growth in 2010 TED Talk
[49:35.640 --> 49:36.640]  Fact Checkers say
[49:36.640 --> 49:39.640]  And then it goes on to say well, not really
[49:39.640 --> 49:40.640]  But hell, Reuters goes further
[49:40.640 --> 49:41.640]  They just say
[49:41.640 --> 49:44.640]  Fact Check Bill Gates quote about vaccines and population growth
[49:44.640 --> 49:47.640]  That has been taken out of context again
[49:47.640 --> 49:51.640]  Here's AP, Bill Gates never said 3 billion people need to die
[49:51.640 --> 49:55.640]  No, just him and Prince Philip and all the rest of them met
[49:55.640 --> 49:58.640]  And so they want to get us down to 500 billion
[49:58.640 --> 50:01.640]  And so that would be 7 billion dead
[50:01.640 --> 50:04.640]  But back when the quote was that would have been over 5 billion dead
[50:04.640 --> 50:06.640]  Of course the Georgia Guidestones and the rest of it
[50:06.640 --> 50:08.640]  So there's Bill Gates never said 3 billion
[50:08.640 --> 50:10.640]  Well, that's right, they said at least 80%
[50:10.640 --> 50:11.640]  You're right, it's much worse
[50:11.640 --> 50:14.640]  So let's show you some of the previous propaganda
[50:14.640 --> 50:16.640]  Back when they wanted to sell us on the idea
[50:16.640 --> 50:21.640]  They were heroes in 2009
[50:21.640 --> 50:23.640]  I've got a list of them who met
[50:23.640 --> 50:27.640]  They met at Einstein University
[50:27.640 --> 50:31.640]  A subgroup at that time of the Rockefeller funded foundation
[50:31.640 --> 50:34.640]  And another year they met at the Rockefeller headquarters in New York
[50:34.640 --> 50:36.640]  I'm going to show you the articles
[50:36.640 --> 50:37.640]  And they actually told the news
[50:37.640 --> 50:40.640]  We're here to set up an alternate world government
[50:40.640 --> 50:42.640]  Outside of governments because they won't do it
[50:42.640 --> 50:44.640]  We're going to have corporations carry out the population
[50:44.640 --> 50:46.640]  Remember the Fauci thing I've been playing the last two days
[50:46.640 --> 50:49.640]  Where they say we need to blow up the system and have corporations take over
[50:49.640 --> 50:54.640]  We need a new deadly virus, avian flu, coronavirus, bird flu
[50:54.640 --> 50:55.640]  Out of China to do it
[50:55.640 --> 50:57.640]  Remember Robin, they just tell you out front
[50:57.640 --> 51:00.640]  So billionaires try to shrink world population reports
[51:00.640 --> 51:05.640]  That says that's out of the Wall Street Journal
[51:05.640 --> 51:07.640]  Wall Street Journal right there
[51:07.640 --> 51:11.640]  Here's another, billionaires hold secret cabal in New York
[51:11.640 --> 51:14.640]  NBC
[51:14.640 --> 51:16.640]  Billionaires try to shrink world population report
[51:16.640 --> 51:19.640]  NBC News, top billionaires hold secret meeting
[51:19.640 --> 51:21.640]  Read the article for depopulation
[51:21.640 --> 51:24.640]  A quiet meeting of America's very richest
[51:24.640 --> 51:26.640]  New York Times, same story to depopulate
[51:26.640 --> 51:28.640]  They're called the good club
[51:28.640 --> 51:31.640]  They gave the world very revealing guardian article
[51:31.640 --> 51:33.640]  It came out the same week about how wonderful they are
[51:33.640 --> 51:37.640]  And how they're going to depopulate you with a global elite
[51:37.640 --> 51:40.640]  Here's ABC News, top billionaires hold secret meeting
[51:40.640 --> 51:42.640]  For depopulation, go read it for yourself
[51:42.640 --> 51:44.640]  And here's the list, the New York Postcott
[51:44.640 --> 51:49.640]  Bill Gates, Ted Turner, Warren Buffett, George Soros
[51:49.640 --> 51:52.640]  Oprah, all the different Rockefellers, it's all there
[51:52.640 --> 51:54.640]  It's even minutes of the meetings
[51:54.640 --> 51:56.640]  So let me show you some of this
[51:56.640 --> 51:58.640]  Because you know, AP says it doesn't exist
[51:58.640 --> 51:59.640]  He really loves you
[51:59.640 --> 52:01.640]  Here's Bill Gates in the video
[52:01.640 --> 52:03.640]  That's 10 minutes long, it's on Band Out Video
[52:03.640 --> 52:05.640]  Watch Bill Gates admit to human depopulation program
[52:05.640 --> 52:07.640]  This is 10 minutes long
[52:07.640 --> 52:10.640]  I'm going to show you a four minute version
[52:10.640 --> 52:12.640]  Here in about 30 seconds
[52:12.640 --> 52:15.640]  But first, remember this, this is out now
[52:15.640 --> 52:17.640]  Breaking, NIH director Francis Collins resigned
[52:17.640 --> 52:20.640]  After documents revealed he lied about his involvement
[52:20.640 --> 52:22.640]  With gain of function research at Wulan Lab
[52:22.640 --> 52:25.640]  Specifically making COVID-19 a plan to release it
[52:25.640 --> 52:27.640]  On the Chinese open air, the Pentagon killed
[52:27.640 --> 52:29.640]  But they just went ahead and did it anyways
[52:29.640 --> 52:32.640]  So here they are actually depopulating us
[52:32.640 --> 52:34.640]  And bringing in the great reset
[52:34.640 --> 52:37.640]  And bringing in the world government with these systems
[52:39.640 --> 52:41.640]  And of course Fauci's been caught lying and the rest of it
[52:41.640 --> 52:43.640]  They need to be arrested, they've done it
[52:43.640 --> 52:46.640]  They actually carried it out, 12 monkeys for real
[52:46.640 --> 52:49.640]  Not a movie, not fiction, it's happening
[52:49.640 --> 52:50.640]  Now they're bringing in the world idea
[52:50.640 --> 52:53.640]  They're bringing in the total control
[52:53.640 --> 52:55.640]  They're going to tie all this slavery and death
[52:55.640 --> 52:57.640]  To this vaccine passport that becomes the global
[52:57.640 --> 53:00.640]  Carbon passport, they admit it, it's not coming, it's here
[53:00.640 --> 53:02.640]  So it's up to you whether you want to live or die
[53:02.640 --> 53:03.640]  It's up to you whether you want to understand
[53:03.640 --> 53:05.640]  They're going to hold up medical care if you don't take these shots
[53:05.640 --> 53:07.640]  But it doesn't matter because the shots slowly kill you
[53:07.640 --> 53:08.640]  They're called soft kill weapons
[53:08.640 --> 53:10.640]  If you don't want to kill somebody right away, they know
[53:10.640 --> 53:13.640]  But it kills you later, it's already happening, ADE
[53:13.640 --> 53:16.640]  Here's the shorter compilation on Bill Gates titled
[53:16.640 --> 53:18.640]  Ultimate Bill Gates Quotes
[53:18.640 --> 53:22.640]  The issue that really grabbed me as urgent
[53:22.640 --> 53:25.640]  Was were issues related to population
[53:25.640 --> 53:27.640]  Issues related to population
[53:27.640 --> 53:31.640]  In 1998, Dr. Zaven became the founding director
[53:31.640 --> 53:34.640]  Of the Bill and Melinda Gates Institute for Population Control
[53:34.640 --> 53:37.640]  Dr. Zaven became the founding director
[53:37.640 --> 53:41.640]  Of the Bill and Melinda Gates Institute for Population Control
[53:41.640 --> 53:45.640]  We see a lot of things that are going very well
[53:45.640 --> 53:47.640]  Things like producing childhood death
[53:47.640 --> 53:52.640]  Things like producing childhood death
[53:52.640 --> 53:57.640]  Things like producing childhood death
[53:57.640 --> 53:59.640]  First we've got population
[53:59.640 --> 54:02.640]  The world today has 6.8 billion people
[54:02.640 --> 54:06.640]  Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines
[54:06.640 --> 54:09.640]  Healthcare, reproductive health services
[54:09.640 --> 54:12.640]  We could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent
[54:12.640 --> 54:18.640]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life
[54:18.640 --> 54:22.640]  For that patient, would it be better not to lay off
[54:22.640 --> 54:27.640]  Those 10 teachers and to make that trade-off in medical costs
[54:27.640 --> 54:29.640]  But that's called the death panel
[54:29.640 --> 54:31.640]  And you're not supposed to have that discussion
[54:31.640 --> 54:33.640]  But that's called the death panel
[54:33.640 --> 54:35.640]  And you're not supposed to have that discussion
[54:35.640 --> 54:37.640]  And you're not supposed to have that discussion
[54:37.640 --> 54:42.640]  Today the greatest risk of global catastrophe
[54:42.640 --> 54:44.640]  Doesn't look like this
[54:44.640 --> 54:49.640]  Instead, it looks like this
[54:49.640 --> 54:54.640]  If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades
[54:54.640 --> 54:57.640]  It's most likely to be a highly infectious virus
[54:57.640 --> 54:59.640]  Rather than a war
[54:59.640 --> 55:04.640]  If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades
[55:04.640 --> 55:08.640]  It's most likely to be a highly infectious virus
[55:08.640 --> 55:10.640]  So let's look at each one of these
[55:10.640 --> 55:13.640]  And see how we can get this down to zero
[55:13.640 --> 55:17.640]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero
[55:17.640 --> 55:21.640]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero
[55:21.640 --> 55:24.640]  Now, malaria is, of course, transmitted by mosquitoes
[55:24.640 --> 55:26.640]  I brought some of these numbers
[55:26.640 --> 55:29.640]  And I'm going to show you some of these numbers
[55:29.640 --> 55:34.640]  Now, malaria is, of course, transmitted by mosquitoes
[55:34.640 --> 55:36.640]  I brought some here
[55:36.640 --> 55:38.640]  So you could experience this
[55:38.640 --> 55:44.640]  We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit
[55:44.640 --> 55:46.640]  I brought some here
[55:46.640 --> 55:49.640]  So you could experience this
[55:49.640 --> 55:56.640]  We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit
[55:56.640 --> 56:00.640]  Did you come to reproductive issues as an intellectual?
[56:00.640 --> 56:06.640]  When I was growing up, my parents were always involved in various volunteer things
[56:06.640 --> 56:12.640]  My dad had a Planned Parenthood
[56:12.640 --> 56:17.640]  The ultimate solution, the only thing that really lets us go back completely to normal
[56:17.640 --> 56:21.640]  And feel good about sitting in a stadium with lots of other people
[56:21.640 --> 56:23.640]  Is to create a vaccine
[56:23.640 --> 56:26.640]  And not just take care of our country
[56:26.640 --> 56:31.640]  But take that vaccine out to the global population
[56:31.640 --> 56:36.640]  Take that vaccine out to the global population
[56:36.640 --> 56:40.640]  We clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range
[56:40.640 --> 56:43.640]  Because they're most at risk of that
[56:43.640 --> 56:46.640]  And doing that so that you amp it up
[56:46.640 --> 56:47.640]  So it works in older people
[56:47.640 --> 56:50.640]  And yet you don't have side effects
[56:50.640 --> 56:55.640]  If we have 1 in 10,000 side effects
[56:55.640 --> 57:02.640]  That's way more 700,000 people who will suffer from that
[57:02.640 --> 57:08.640]  Way more 700,000 people who will suffer from that
[57:08.640 --> 57:09.640]  But you don't have a choice
[57:09.640 --> 57:11.640]  People act like you have a choice
[57:11.640 --> 57:17.640]  People don't feel like going to the stadium when they might get infected
[57:17.640 --> 57:19.640]  But you don't have a choice
[57:19.640 --> 57:21.640]  People act like you have a choice
[57:21.640 --> 57:25.640]  What else are we not listening to that we need to take action on now?
[57:25.640 --> 57:32.640]  Well the idea of a bioterrorist attack is kind of the nightmare scenario
[57:32.640 --> 57:37.640]  The idea of a bioterrorist attack is kind of the nightmare scenario
[57:37.640 --> 57:50.600]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[57:50.600 --> 57:54.920]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[57:54.920 --> 58:00.880]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[58:00.880 --> 58:04.560]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[58:04.560 --> 58:09.480]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[58:09.480 --> 58:13.720]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[58:13.720 --> 58:17.920]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[58:17.920 --> 58:20.600]  That's why everybody should visit InfowarsStore.com.

[58:54.800 --> 58:56.360]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[58:56.360 --> 58:59.720]  The bad news is a lot of them are about to sell out.
[58:59.720 --> 59:04.400]  So this sale is only going from one week starting on September 29th and in the case of green
[59:04.400 --> 59:09.800]  fiber capsules, these will be sold out in just a couple of days, 50% off.

[59:14.920 --> 59:18.880]  as knockout, probably too strong for some people, totally different formula.
[59:18.880 --> 59:21.480]  Down and out is back in stock, 50% off.
[59:21.480 --> 59:26.520]  We've extended the sale on Winter Sun and Ultra 12, 50% off and also on Deep Breath Crystal
[59:26.520 --> 59:28.520]  iodine survival selects too.

[59:32.040 --> 59:36.760]  Take advantage of it and fund the Infowar and I thank you all for your support. InfowarsStore.com
[59:36.760 --> 59:40.600]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[59:40.600 --> 59:41.600]  It's a win-win.
[59:41.600 --> 59:45.480]  These are things that make you healthy, make your life better and they fund the Infowar.
[59:45.480 --> 59:51.720]  Again, all we lose is if you don't take action right now.
[59:51.720 --> 59:57.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:57.680 --> 1:00:04.680]  YouTube is now a communist state. YouTube is the vanguard of tyranny.
[1:00:04.680 --> 1:00:10.680]  YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki scuttles around drawing in her prey so that she can suck the
[1:00:10.680 --> 1:00:12.840]  life out of free speech.
[1:00:12.840 --> 1:00:16.640]  We've seen Mark Zuckerberg, we've seen Jack Dorsey now testify before Congress multiple
[1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:21.960]  times and I've heard it said that YouTube is getting a pass. Do you think you should
[1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:23.440]  be up there testifying?
[1:00:23.440 --> 1:00:26.360]  I think we do go a lot of scrutiny.
[1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:30.920]  Russian Foreign Ministry denounces aggression. The name's a silence RT after YouTube bans
[1:00:30.920 --> 1:00:37.400]  two German language channels for talking about natural immunity existing.
[1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:44.200]  It's like saying RT is banned for saying birds fly in the sky or grass is green.
[1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:46.600]  Would Google ever leave Russia like it left China?
[1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:50.880]  I think we really want to make sure that we're working and serving audiences as much as we
[1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:52.080]  possibly can.
[1:00:52.080 --> 1:00:58.640]  The web of YouTube has more than one billion users who watch more than one billion hours
[1:00:58.640 --> 1:01:00.720]  of video every day.
[1:01:00.720 --> 1:01:06.680]  It wasn't hard to see them slowly censoring starting four years ago, but even if you slowly
[1:01:06.680 --> 1:01:11.440]  censor pretty soon, even if you slowly drink a glass of water, pretty soon you're at the
[1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:12.600]  bottom of the glass.
[1:01:12.600 --> 1:01:16.840]  It's old dinosaur media working with big tech that's owned by the big banks that owns
[1:01:16.840 --> 1:01:17.840]  Big Pharma.
[1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:22.360]  And Big Pharma is their system to assault us and to depopulate us, to sterilize us.
[1:01:22.360 --> 1:01:23.600]  They all go together.
[1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:28.560]  We're going to recommend companies that we know have a long tradition of delivering reliable
[1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:29.560]  news.
[1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:35.320]  Dr. Gupta mentioned about, you know, not putting masks on kids that's not effective, not necessary.
[1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:39.400]  That YouTube told the Wall Street Journal, violated the consensus of local and global
[1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:45.240]  health authorities regarding the efficacy of masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
[1:01:45.240 --> 1:01:50.680]  DeSantis spokesman told Fox News, YouTube's action is another blatant example of big tech
[1:01:50.680 --> 1:01:55.400]  attempting to silence those who disagree with their woke corporate agenda, noting the panel
[1:01:55.400 --> 1:01:59.960]  featured world-renowned scientists from Oxford, Stanford and Harvard.
[1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:05.160]  Resolution before the Clark County Commission today would declare all misinformation and
[1:02:05.160 --> 1:02:09.600]  disinformation related to the coronavirus a public health crisis, potentially clearing
[1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:13.040]  the way for more concrete policies to come.
[1:02:13.040 --> 1:02:18.520]  The resolution does not define what misinformation is, but says that the practice has significantly
[1:02:18.520 --> 1:02:22.880]  undermined public health efforts and created a culture of mistrust.
[1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:27.760]  Listen, banning all anti-vaccine content, it's not going to be easy.
[1:02:27.760 --> 1:02:32.840]  It's a complicated content moderation problem, because anti-vaxxers are very good at evading
[1:02:32.840 --> 1:02:33.840]  the platforms.
[1:02:33.840 --> 1:02:37.360]  And so we're just going to have to wait to see how well they do.
[1:02:37.360 --> 1:02:41.640]  And so before they launched COVID-19 on us, they got control of all the major health departments
[1:02:41.640 --> 1:02:43.000]  of the world, except a few.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.040]  They put out the lie that didn't come out of the Wuhan lab.
[1:02:45.040 --> 1:02:46.360]  They put out all those lies.
[1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:48.440]  They sold all that propaganda.
[1:02:48.440 --> 1:02:52.600]  And when people tried to speak out against it, prominent doctors, prominent scientists,
[1:02:52.600 --> 1:02:57.560]  the heads of their fields, Nobel Prize winners, they were universally censored and blocked
[1:02:57.560 --> 1:02:59.200]  out and blacked out.
[1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:05.200]  YouTube has now banned any COVID-19 vaccine videos that don't succumb to the narrative,
[1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:11.200]  including Dr. Joseph Merkola and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who they claim are partially
[1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:17.400]  responsible for the skepticism contributing to the slowing vaccination rates across the
[1:03:17.400 --> 1:03:18.400]  country.
[1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:25.840]  Back at home in the United States, the newspapers are saying that I came here today to speak
[1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:34.720]  to about 5,000 Nazis, but I look at this crowd, and I see the opposite of Nazism.
[1:03:34.720 --> 1:03:39.160]  People who want open government, people who want leaders that are not going to lie to
[1:03:39.160 --> 1:03:40.160]  them.
[1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:47.360]  We want health officials who don't have financial entanglements with the pharmaceutical industry
[1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:50.160]  who are working for us and not big pharma.
[1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:56.360]  You are not going to take away our freedom, you are not going to poison our children.
[1:03:56.360 --> 1:04:02.000]  We are going to demand our democracy back, thank you all very much for fighting.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:08.400]  YouTube stated its tyrannical demand, saying, specifically, content that falsely alleges
[1:04:08.400 --> 1:04:15.200]  that approved vaccines are dangerous and cause chronic health effects, claims that vaccines
[1:04:15.200 --> 1:04:20.920]  do not reduce transmission or contraction of the disease or contain misinformation on
[1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:25.760]  the substances contained in vaccines will be removed.
[1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:32.280]  This would include content that falsely says that approved vaccines cause autism, cancer
[1:04:32.280 --> 1:04:38.000]  or infertility, or that substances in the vaccines contract those who receive them.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  If you want to talk about adverse reactions in the measles or chicken pox vaccine, then
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.320]  the ban is non-existent.
[1:04:45.320 --> 1:04:50.160]  Just don't dare utter a word about the New World Order inoculation.
[1:04:50.160 --> 1:04:51.680]  John Bowne reporting.
[1:04:51.680 --> 1:04:53.560]  That's a powerful report.
[1:04:53.560 --> 1:04:54.560]  It's on Banned.Video.
[1:04:54.560 --> 1:04:55.560]  Save lives.
[1:04:55.560 --> 1:04:56.560]  Share it.
[1:04:56.560 --> 1:05:04.400]  I want to explain something that is absolutely key to understanding our world.
[1:05:04.400 --> 1:05:07.400]  It's very, very simple, but the most people don't know.
[1:05:07.400 --> 1:05:14.120]  The privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions
[1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:20.680]  of dollars in other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual
[1:05:20.680 --> 1:05:23.680]  property, energy.
[1:05:23.680 --> 1:05:28.680]  They're using it to buy people, to buy influence, and in the past, they created thousands of
[1:05:28.680 --> 1:05:32.720]  trillions so that they could leverage that, manipulate markets, but they never allowed
[1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:37.680]  that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[1:05:37.680 --> 1:05:42.200]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy
[1:05:42.200 --> 1:05:48.200]  buying up everything, not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and
[1:05:48.200 --> 1:05:53.000]  force a collapse of civilization, making the companies they do fund the only things left
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  standing.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  This is the Great Reset.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  This is what's happening now.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:19.200]  The war on everyone is the only way to stop it.
[1:06:19.200 --> 1:06:23.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are living in incredibly historic times.
[1:06:23.080 --> 1:06:29.240]  Welcome to hour number two on this October 6, Wednesday broadcast.
[1:06:29.240 --> 1:06:32.200]  Coming up next segment, I'm going to give out the toll free number and I'm hosting
[1:06:32.200 --> 1:06:37.040]  the fourth hour today as well, so we're going to have two hours and at least 30 minutes
[1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:42.840]  of phone calls here on the transmission and you heard a lot of what I covered last hour,
[1:06:42.840 --> 1:06:48.080]  the outrageous claims by the Associated Press, Reuters, and others that Bill Gates never
[1:06:48.080 --> 1:06:49.640]  wanted depopulation.
[1:06:49.640 --> 1:06:54.960]  He wants a bigger population, he wants more people, and his shots are so safe and he loves
[1:06:54.960 --> 1:06:55.960]  you.
[1:06:55.960 --> 1:06:58.960]  And then of course I showed all the documents in his own videos and his own statements.
[1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:03.920]  They want to depopulate by 90% and use tainted vaccines to do it.
[1:07:03.920 --> 1:07:05.400]  Absolutely insane.
[1:07:05.400 --> 1:07:06.560]  We can get into that.
[1:07:06.560 --> 1:07:10.400]  We can get into the incredible footage I'm going to get to here next segment of Biden,
[1:07:10.400 --> 1:07:15.440]  not knowing who he is and Kerry telling French TV that Biden quote literally not aware of
[1:07:15.440 --> 1:07:17.600]  what's going on or what he's doing.
[1:07:17.600 --> 1:07:18.600]  That's all coming up.
[1:07:18.600 --> 1:07:23.080]  I don't want to hit this right now, it was actually in my stack already today before
[1:07:23.080 --> 1:07:27.720]  we had a shooting in Arlington, Texas, a suburb of Dallas and Fort Worth.
[1:07:27.720 --> 1:07:31.440]  It's between the two of them, one of my old stomping grounds growing up where I moved down
[1:07:31.440 --> 1:07:34.120]  here in late high school, but side issue.
[1:07:34.120 --> 1:07:39.880]  I already had my stack that they will take a shooting where two or three people get injured
[1:07:39.880 --> 1:07:44.880]  or one person dies and it will be on the news for days of not weeks and it will be the end
[1:07:44.880 --> 1:07:52.160]  of the world and it will be every gun owners fault that that person died or some Ridland
[1:07:52.160 --> 1:08:00.080]  Prozac head shoot them up video game devil worshiper who love the Columbine operation,
[1:08:00.080 --> 1:08:04.920]  those in and shoots little kids in Connecticut and then every gun owner is to blame and Remington
[1:08:04.920 --> 1:08:09.240]  is to blame because Adam lands it illegally got the gun from his mother.
[1:08:09.240 --> 1:08:14.000]  I mean, that's just preposterous like if somebody stole a Ford truck and ran over a bunch of
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:20.280]  people like the Muslims do, would Ford truck be to blame or would it be radical jihadi?
[1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:21.440]  So it's the same story over and over again.
[1:08:21.440 --> 1:08:26.520]  So I'm already was planning to talk about that today because of the big announcement
[1:08:26.520 --> 1:08:30.960]  and the big letter that was sent out by the Attorney General that actually agrees with
[1:08:30.960 --> 1:08:35.560]  the National Education Association and the National Teachers Union and the National
[1:08:35.560 --> 1:08:40.400]  Association of School Districts that are supposedly independent but about as globalist
[1:08:40.400 --> 1:08:48.440]  and communist as Lenin's left toe absolutely out of control.
[1:08:48.440 --> 1:08:52.240]  And then sure enough, there's another shooting in Dallas four injured gang related and as
[1:08:52.240 --> 1:08:57.320]  soon as it turned out that the reported shooter was black, that went off the TV faster and
[1:08:57.320 --> 1:09:00.320]  you could say twinkle in your eye.
[1:09:00.320 --> 1:09:01.960]  So what's really going on here?
[1:09:01.960 --> 1:09:06.360]  Well, they said as soon as Biden stole his way in, white supremacist are the number one
[1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:10.800]  terror threat in America and they said in what are white supremacist people that question
[1:09:10.800 --> 1:09:13.960]  the election, people that question lockdowns.
[1:09:13.960 --> 1:09:19.720]  And they started saying that in late January, early February of this year.
[1:09:19.720 --> 1:09:26.800]  And then they segwayed over by June and put out this big giant report that I know you've
[1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:30.920]  gotten sick of me since June showing probably 300, 400 times.
[1:09:30.920 --> 1:09:35.400]  I mean, every couple days I show this national strategy for countering domestic terrorism
[1:09:35.400 --> 1:09:47.240]  June 2021 official executive policy and directive of the Pentagon of the CIA of the FBI to illegally
[1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:50.520]  domestically surveil white people.
[1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:55.480]  And you've seen General Milley and General Austin and all up on TV saying yes, January
[1:09:55.480 --> 1:09:59.360]  6 was a white supremacist attack and white supremacism is the number one threat in the
[1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:04.880]  head of the FBI, the head of the just department and it's just anybody, a white supremacist
[1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:08.240]  aren't even on the radar screen as statistically as a threat to anybody.
[1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:15.200]  Okay, most of them are FBI agents, provocateurs or ADL, Southern private law center operatives.
[1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:20.400]  Be certainly people that question the election or don't like lockdowns or question the vaccines
[1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:21.400]  that aren't vaccines.
[1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:23.040]  Clearly, they're not white supremacist.
[1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:29.000]  This document says that they are white supremacist that you are a white supremacist that I'm
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  one.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:33.720]  They said that Larry Elder was the leader of white supremacist in California.
[1:10:33.720 --> 1:10:40.120]  That's an L.A. Times headline, a black lawyer who's been a conservative icon for decades.
[1:10:40.120 --> 1:10:41.120]  He's a white supremacist.
[1:10:41.120 --> 1:10:43.000]  You didn't know that?
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:44.640]  Not Larry Elder?
[1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:46.680]  So that's this asinine insanity.
[1:10:46.680 --> 1:10:48.160]  But people are like, oh, this is a joke.
[1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:49.440]  No, it's not a joke.
[1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:54.440]  It's our hijacked country with the same globalists that cooked up the Wuhan bio weapon, the China
[1:10:54.440 --> 1:10:58.880]  virus that released it on us, they use it for a lockdown that wouldn't let us have treatments
[1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:00.480]  that now is bringing out other variants.
[1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:04.400]  They're clearly spraying that we learned from sources the Pentagon was happening, now confirmed
[1:11:04.400 --> 1:11:08.600]  they've created these prion crystals that are synthetic, but actually replicate from
[1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:12.320]  the spike protein and we're spraying it on the Chinese people, not just us.
[1:11:12.320 --> 1:11:15.200]  People keep saying the Chinese government did it.
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:20.360]  No, the globalist consortium did it and their target is all of humanity.
[1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:25.040]  So national strategy for countering domestic terrorism June 2021.
[1:11:25.040 --> 1:11:26.640]  Go read it in here word for word.
[1:11:26.640 --> 1:11:30.160]  It says questioning elections, questioning lockdowns.
[1:11:30.160 --> 1:11:31.160]  You are a white supremacist.
[1:11:31.160 --> 1:11:32.160]  You are a terrorist.
[1:11:32.160 --> 1:11:34.520]  It actually says this is white supremacist activities.
[1:11:34.520 --> 1:11:36.040]  White supremacism is terrorism.
[1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:42.560]  Well now the head of the just department comes out two days ago and issues a letter within
[1:11:42.560 --> 1:11:47.360]  48 hours of the teachers unions coming out saying we're being attacked by terrorists.
[1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:50.280]  We've gotten death threats, probably called it on themselves.
[1:11:50.280 --> 1:11:53.320]  Oh my God, people yelled at us.
[1:11:53.320 --> 1:11:57.200]  We want anyone getting loud or saying things like you'll be stopped.
[1:11:57.200 --> 1:11:59.160]  We want them arrested.
[1:11:59.160 --> 1:12:00.160]  Yes.
[1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:03.600]  At the same time that they're attacking Rand Paul repeatedly and death, redding and
[1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:07.680]  shooting scolese and burning down billions of dollars of buildings and shooting people
[1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:12.040]  on the back and saying Antifa is good and protests, you know, are mostly peaceful or
[1:12:12.040 --> 1:12:14.640]  whoever said they've got to be peaceful.
[1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:19.120]  These are all quotes by these people and you've got Maxine waters and all of them in Biden
[1:12:19.120 --> 1:12:23.480]  a couple of days ago saying people being attacked and elevators and chasing the bathrooms.
[1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:28.080]  That's just part of regular behavior when it's done to people they oppose.
[1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:32.960]  And if Owen Schreuer standing outside the Capitol with me as a press person covering
[1:12:32.960 --> 1:12:39.680]  January 6th and trying to stop it, he faces two years in jail for quote trespassing on
[1:12:39.680 --> 1:12:41.800]  the Capitol grounds.
[1:12:41.800 --> 1:12:46.000]  So this is a system rolling out and saying the American people are the enemy saying that
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:52.200]  the American people are the problem and that the whole focus of the federal government
[1:12:52.200 --> 1:12:55.560]  and the teachers unions locally is to watch the terrorist.
[1:12:55.560 --> 1:13:00.920]  And then we also have quotes by major Democrat leaders all over the news that education should
[1:13:00.920 --> 1:13:02.880]  be left to the school, not the parents.
[1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:03.880]  Those are real quotes.
[1:13:03.880 --> 1:13:05.640]  I've got them coming up.
[1:13:05.640 --> 1:13:06.640]  It's all over the place.
[1:13:06.640 --> 1:13:09.120]  A few months ago I was showing headlines.
[1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:13.440]  People thought they were fake out of Newsweek and the New York Times and others saying it's
[1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:15.600]  time to get parents out of the school.
[1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:17.920]  What do you think the lockdowns were last year?
[1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:22.280]  Not letting parents in the school or people in to see their parents in nursing homes.
[1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:24.400]  Children can't see their parents in nursing homes.
[1:13:24.400 --> 1:13:27.720]  Kids can't see their children in 1st grade, 5th grade, 10th grade.
[1:13:27.720 --> 1:13:28.720]  You understand?
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:29.960]  It's a prison system.
[1:13:29.960 --> 1:13:35.600]  It's a bureaucracy declaring we're slaves in a giant Stanford research prison experiment
[1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:37.000]  or Milgram experiment.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:41.360]  Look them up to see what orders will follow.
[1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:43.080]  And at first a lot of folks follow the orders.
[1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:44.080]  But now they're not.
[1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:45.080]  They're figuring it out.
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:46.080]  They're sussing it.
[1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:47.200]  They smell the rat.
[1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:49.640]  They saw the rat.
[1:13:49.640 --> 1:13:52.400]  And now they're being told, oh, you're a terrorist.
[1:13:52.400 --> 1:13:57.720]  There is the letter put out by the Attorney General directing the FBI and other agencies
[1:13:57.720 --> 1:14:00.760]  to go meet and do threat assessments and to be there and work with local law enforcement
[1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:02.080]  to stop the terrorist.
[1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:07.480]  Carl and I asked FBI to address threats against school board and all the rest of it as they
[1:14:07.480 --> 1:14:08.480]  teach.
[1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:09.480]  Your child is racist because they're white.
[1:14:09.480 --> 1:14:12.440]  And we're going to teach your 5-year-old they're really a girl, they're a boy, they're
[1:14:12.440 --> 1:14:15.360]  a girl, they're a boy, they're a boy, they're a girl.
[1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:17.280]  All of this crap.
[1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:21.400]  This is the externalization of what they've done on the campuses on to the streets of
[1:14:21.400 --> 1:14:22.400]  America.
[1:14:22.400 --> 1:14:23.400]  Same thing in the military.
[1:14:23.400 --> 1:14:24.400]  Everywhere.
[1:14:24.400 --> 1:14:29.200]  It's how the communists brainwash people in any nation that they control.
[1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:31.240]  It is a politically motivated abuse of power.
[1:14:31.240 --> 1:14:37.400]  GOP representative rages at AG Garland's weaponization of the DOJ against dissenting parents.
[1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:39.280]  Now do you get it?
[1:14:39.280 --> 1:14:41.840]  It is the weaponization.
[1:14:41.840 --> 1:14:46.240]  The COVID is the weaponization, the open borders, the devaluation of the currency, the
[1:14:46.240 --> 1:14:50.880]  no borders, the no wall, the purging the military of smart people that won't take the experimental
[1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:52.880]  shot of getting rid of the smart nurses.
[1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:58.080]  They're getting their army of subservient minions together that'll do what they're told.
[1:14:58.080 --> 1:15:02.200]  And who are going to be hopping pissed as they start getting sick from the shots and
[1:15:02.200 --> 1:15:06.120]  they're going to be blaming us, which they already are, I predicted 20 months ago.
[1:15:06.120 --> 1:15:08.200]  Oh, we didn't take the shot.
[1:15:08.200 --> 1:15:10.400]  It's our fault they're sick.
[1:15:10.400 --> 1:15:12.400]  You see, we're terrorists.
[1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:13.760]  Remember, they saw the news.
[1:15:13.760 --> 1:15:14.760]  It's terrorism.
[1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:19.880]  You're like a suicide bomber, said Kathleen Sebelius, former head under Obama of Health
[1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:22.280]  and Human Services, if you don't take the shots.
[1:15:22.280 --> 1:15:24.000]  Your children are little murderers.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:26.440]  They're terrorists when they don't take the shots or wear the mask.
[1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:27.680]  You're all bad.
[1:15:27.680 --> 1:15:28.680]  You're bad.
[1:15:28.680 --> 1:15:29.680]  We're good.
[1:15:29.680 --> 1:15:32.880]  All the lights are racist and everybody else is dirty and bad and needs these shots.
[1:15:32.880 --> 1:15:35.200]  We got to surveil you and watch you and don't talk to your neighbors.
[1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:38.680]  Don't look at the sunset and just do whatever we say.
[1:15:38.680 --> 1:15:44.280]  It's an absolute revolution of big banks and corporations and bureaucrats and slime bags
[1:15:44.280 --> 1:15:50.040]  and pedophiles and trash against us as they try to absorb us and take us over.
[1:15:50.040 --> 1:15:53.640]  When we come back, I'll actually get to some of these clips and break down what's coming
[1:15:53.640 --> 1:15:54.640]  next and all of this.
[1:15:54.640 --> 1:16:00.560]  Stay with us.
[1:16:00.560 --> 1:16:02.560]  Your voice counts.
[1:16:02.560 --> 1:16:07.520]  When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes the world.
[1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:10.120]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:11.640]  They know you're angry.
[1:16:11.640 --> 1:16:15.920]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[1:16:15.920 --> 1:16:16.920]  we've got.

[1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:02.160]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[1:17:02.160 --> 1:17:03.160]  Me too.
[1:17:03.160 --> 1:17:07.360]  Listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's
[1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:10.080]  one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[1:17:10.080 --> 1:17:14.440]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[1:17:14.440 --> 1:17:16.160]  You probably already believe that.
[1:17:16.160 --> 1:17:17.360]  I certainly do.
[1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:18.360]  So here's the thing.
[1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:22.760]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually
[1:17:22.760 --> 1:17:26.760]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:32.600]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefence.com.
[1:17:32.600 --> 1:17:37.840]  No cures or treatments there, instead, little-known but shocking immune system research, and a
[1:17:37.840 --> 1:17:43.200]  breakthrough immune support product based on that research called Immune 10x.

[1:17:58.520 --> 1:18:03.200]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war
[1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:08.800]  between free individuals and nation-states on one side and the globalist on the other
[1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:12.440]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[1:18:12.440 --> 1:18:16.640]  From the United States to Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations
[1:18:16.640 --> 1:18:20.320]  were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:25.720]  That's why they launched their Great Reset, and their program after collapsing us of Build
[1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:27.520]  Back Better.
[1:18:27.520 --> 1:18:33.520]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy, and because
[1:18:33.520 --> 1:18:37.800]  they couldn't take our guns, and because we wouldn't bow, because the left, which is
[1:18:37.800 --> 1:18:43.120]  the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win, they released a biological weapon
[1:18:43.120 --> 1:18:44.120]  on us.
[1:18:44.120 --> 1:18:48.120]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[1:18:48.120 --> 1:18:49.120]  It's that simple.
[1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:53.520]  They can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns, so the global corporate combine
[1:18:53.520 --> 1:18:58.360]  released COVID-19, and you know the rest of history, expose this paradigm, and we win.
[1:18:58.360 --> 1:19:00.880]  My business model is very, very simple.
[1:19:00.880 --> 1:19:05.880]  I want to bring you products that work really, really well at affordable prices that are
[1:19:05.880 --> 1:19:11.000]  competitive so that you'll shop with us, and so we form a relationship so we're able to
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:16.160]  stay on air and fight the globalist and have good products that make us healthy, make us
[1:19:16.160 --> 1:19:19.520]  wiser, that boost our immune system, and that's what we've done.
[1:19:19.520 --> 1:19:23.640]  Now one area of the immune system we don't talk enough about is deep, restful sleep.
[1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:24.840]  Look it up for yourself.
[1:19:24.840 --> 1:19:28.560]  The effects of deep, restful sleep on health and the immune system, and so with everything
[1:19:28.560 --> 1:19:32.520]  we're doing out there to boost our immune system with vitamin D and zinc and all of
[1:19:32.520 --> 1:19:36.880]  it, that's great, but deep, restful sleep is just as important, maybe more important.
[1:19:36.880 --> 1:19:42.360]  So, infowarstore.com now can announce 50% off on our best-selling product, down and
[1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:45.440]  out, that just came back in after four months being sold out.
[1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:46.440]  It's 50% off.
[1:19:46.440 --> 1:19:48.640]  It's super strong, so be careful with it.
[1:19:48.640 --> 1:19:51.760]  If you want deep, restful sleep, this will do it.
[1:19:51.760 --> 1:19:52.760]  Everybody loves it.
[1:19:52.760 --> 1:20:01.320]  Five stars, infowarstore.com, down and out, now back in stock, 50% off.
[1:20:01.320 --> 1:20:26.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:26.600 --> 1:20:49.960]  All right, we got some good news, the Gateway Fund is huge, they have millions of visitors
[1:20:49.960 --> 1:20:55.560]  a day, and when I shot this emergency report Wednesday night, I knew it was incredibly
[1:20:55.560 --> 1:20:59.160]  important, and I knew if listeners got it out, it would go chain reaction.
[1:20:59.160 --> 1:21:03.400]  Just like last Friday, we helped boost Mike Adams' story, and he gets a lot of stuff out
[1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:06.720]  without our help, that's great, I'm glad he's there, but our listeners really took that
[1:21:06.720 --> 1:21:11.600]  report that the Pentagon had put out that a lawyer had discovered on the Pentagon's
[1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:16.840]  website with their AI software saying the majority of people dead and dying in hospitals
[1:21:16.840 --> 1:21:20.760]  have had the so-called vaccines, and that it's destroying their immune system and giving
[1:21:20.760 --> 1:21:22.760]  them ADE.
[1:21:22.760 --> 1:21:27.040]  Now that's hit mainstream news today, that's in major newspapers today, and people are
[1:21:27.040 --> 1:21:30.960]  freaking out, just hard core numbers, you can't disagree with them.
[1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:36.040]  Well Gateway Fund saw it and thought it was compelling, explosive video emerges of Fauci
[1:21:36.040 --> 1:21:43.160]  and HHS officials plotting for a new avian flu virus, that's a quote, to enforce universal
[1:21:43.160 --> 1:21:50.960]  flu vaccination, and I love how Jim Hoff did a better headline than I wrote Monday night
[1:21:50.960 --> 1:21:54.160]  because he just has better headlines than I am, because that's really what it says,
[1:21:54.160 --> 1:21:57.960]  our headline was powerful but not that powerful, so we're going to cover that a little bit
[1:21:57.960 --> 1:21:58.960]  next segment.
[1:21:58.960 --> 1:22:02.320]  I want to give the number out on anything you want to ask, anything you want to say,
[1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:09.000]  you agree, you disagree, any subject you want to discuss on this Wednesday edition.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:19.920]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539-877-789, Alex, 877-789-2539, but we got to flip the
[1:22:19.920 --> 1:22:23.640]  computer system on, it's a computerized phone system, I think I got to flip it on, so call
[1:22:23.640 --> 1:22:28.720]  in a few minutes or you'll just sit there calling in to oblivion and we will get you
[1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:34.480]  up and on the air, and I ask for one more thing, let's let first-time callers on today,
[1:22:34.480 --> 1:22:39.000]  first-time callers today, but free for all, I want to hear from first-time callers or
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:46.440]  folks that haven't been on in a few years, 877-789-2539-877-789, Alex, and if you're calling from some
[1:22:46.440 --> 1:22:51.480]  place still under martial law like New Zealand or Australia or blue cities in the U.S., I'd
[1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:58.160]  love to hear from you as well, and we'll put you ahead of the line, 877-789-2539 or international
[1:22:58.160 --> 1:23:08.320]  country code, 01512-646-1776, OK, let me just finish up with what I was getting into, though.
[1:23:08.320 --> 1:23:11.920]  The federal government has officially been captured by the globalists, they've been
[1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:15.680]  there a long time but now they're in control, and they've had the FBI and the CIA as their
[1:23:15.680 --> 1:23:20.680]  official directive that the American people doing anything nationalistic or anything patriotic
[1:23:20.680 --> 1:23:22.680]  are terrorists, OK?
[1:23:22.680 --> 1:23:26.200]  And so then you wonder why they then go, oh, well, we want you to come after people at
[1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:32.440]  school boards, that's to intimidate you, and they'll surely now claim that, oh, we got
[1:23:32.440 --> 1:23:38.240]  chatter that some dad that got mad was planning something and they'll be busted as a terrorist
[1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:41.920]  that was planning to blow up the school, I mean, you see where this goes, folks, but
[1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:45.520]  then they do up the mass shooting at a school and say they were mad about the vaccines or
[1:23:45.520 --> 1:23:49.680]  they were mad about the mask or they were mad about a critical race theory to make everyone
[1:23:49.680 --> 1:23:52.960]  that opposes their takeover the bad people.
[1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:58.240]  Just like the baby that died in Roe v. Wade in 1970 did not die.
[1:23:58.240 --> 1:24:00.120]  She's alive, it's all confirmed.
[1:24:00.120 --> 1:24:01.640]  Family admits it, mother admits it.
[1:24:01.640 --> 1:24:03.400]  That was staged.
[1:24:03.400 --> 1:24:07.720]  Usually they want to control any big PR event, like babies and incubators were not thrown
[1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:11.160]  out and killed by Saddam to launch the whole Iraq war that killed millions of people later
[1:24:11.160 --> 1:24:12.240]  from starvation.
[1:24:12.240 --> 1:24:16.800]  That was all made up, PR firm, Gulf of Tongass into Vietnam, that was staged, but the millions
[1:24:16.800 --> 1:24:20.320]  that died out of it, no, that was real.
[1:24:20.320 --> 1:24:25.960]  Operation Northwood was a staged operation, and we catch them all the time.
[1:24:25.960 --> 1:24:29.760]  That's why I've questioned other events that have anomalies because you just don't know.
[1:24:29.760 --> 1:24:36.160]  I'd say 95% of the time these big giant events are staged, and are we going to get it wrong
[1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:37.160]  sometimes?
[1:24:37.160 --> 1:24:41.680]  Absolutely, but now in hindsight, on the one or two I've said I might have got wrong questioning,
[1:24:41.680 --> 1:24:45.480]  I have a right to question, and now that I get more into it, I'm like, wait, there are
[1:24:45.480 --> 1:24:48.080]  anomalies I didn't even know about.
[1:24:48.080 --> 1:24:53.000]  Maybe those things, maybe those things are staged, or they're certainly staging something.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:57.680]  I mean, once you go through Jesse Smollett and Bubba Wallace and ABC News saying, here
[1:24:57.680 --> 1:25:04.640]  are the Syrians blowing up a major city with 5,000-foot flames and mushroom clouds, and
[1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:08.160]  it's the machine gun shootout at Nob Creek, and they're 5-foot flames.
[1:25:08.160 --> 1:25:11.680]  You might as well have dioramas of armymen killing each other.
[1:25:11.680 --> 1:25:14.920]  I mean, once you've been lied to, I mean, if I have a neighbor that lies to me two or
[1:25:14.920 --> 1:25:16.080]  three times, I never believe him.
[1:25:16.080 --> 1:25:19.560]  If they lie to me 20 times, I move out.
[1:25:19.560 --> 1:25:26.120]  I mean, they lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, then, oh, Alex Jones is liable.
[1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:30.080]  He questioned these events, and you're not allowed to do that, and they misrepresent
[1:25:30.080 --> 1:25:32.440]  what I said or what I did, and then, well, let me have a jury trial.
[1:25:32.440 --> 1:25:36.480]  Oh, you didn't give us any of the stuff in depositions, and in the meetings, you didn't
[1:25:36.480 --> 1:25:40.400]  give us discovery, so now, you're forfeit.
[1:25:40.400 --> 1:25:44.160]  You don't get a jury trial on if you're guilty or not.
[1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:49.760]  A jury decides how much money you pay as a message to others that shuts your mouth, unprecedented
[1:25:49.760 --> 1:25:52.600]  when we gave them more discovery than anybody's ever seen.
[1:25:52.600 --> 1:25:58.480]  All of it lies, but that's okay, because that's all they got, that's what the system's got.
[1:25:58.480 --> 1:26:02.600]  So they're fighting old battles, trying to discredit those of us that have credibility
[1:26:02.600 --> 1:26:05.000]  when it is now a pop saying everywhere.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:10.960]  I walk in to a grocery store, I walk in to get my teeth cleaned, I walk in to places
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:12.920]  I've never been, and you know what people say to me?
[1:26:12.920 --> 1:26:17.760]  Alex Jones was right, Alex Jones was right, Alex Jones was right, Alex Jones was right,
[1:26:17.760 --> 1:26:22.240]  and it's not about Alex Jones having an ego or Alex Jones being this big superstar, that's
[1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:26.280]  not what it is, it's about the truth, and Alex Jones being a symbol of the truth that
[1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:31.280]  they've tried to make a symbol of lies, and they have failed.
[1:26:31.280 --> 1:26:33.640]  They have failed big time.
[1:26:33.640 --> 1:26:35.880]  They have failed to suppress you and your family.
[1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:37.080]  They failed to suppress me.
[1:26:37.080 --> 1:26:41.760]  Yeah, I did a really good interview with Elijah Shaffer, I think they did a great job, and
[1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:44.640]  Savannah Hernandez, formerly with Info Wars, I'm glad she's up there at the blade, she
[1:26:44.640 --> 1:26:49.160]  has a great job there, and it's an hour and 20 minutes long, it's excellent, they cover
[1:26:49.160 --> 1:26:52.320]  a lot of the history of what we've done, it's a really in depth interview, I think it's
[1:26:52.320 --> 1:26:55.800]  one of the best interviews I've given, they let me talk, and I was also in a very calm
[1:26:55.800 --> 1:26:59.520]  mood because I'd already been doing so much, and that's now live at infowars.com, I hope
[1:26:59.520 --> 1:27:03.440]  you share that as well, but getting back to this, coming up later video, Tucker Carlson
[1:27:03.440 --> 1:27:08.440]  warns, it's now criminal to disagree with your kids in school, well it's now terrorist.
[1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:13.040]  That's how desperate and outside an alien, the globalist are to the American Republic
[1:27:13.040 --> 1:27:14.040]  way of life.
[1:27:14.040 --> 1:27:19.560]  There's a meme going around that shows, again, the parents that were being called terrorists,
[1:27:19.560 --> 1:27:24.680]  holding up signs saying, parents choice, let the parents decide, no mass mandate, parents
[1:27:24.680 --> 1:27:30.160]  choice, our children our choice, and then here, ladies and gentlemen, is the mostly
[1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:37.400]  peaceful protest of billions of dollars destroyed, more than 30 people killed and thousands injured,
[1:27:37.400 --> 1:27:40.800]  that is the peace of the left.
[1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:45.840]  That is the love of the left, that is what they're doing, and then after I take calls
[1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:49.440]  and we get more of this later, everybody's focused on four injured in high school shooting
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:54.480]  in Arlington, Texas, until it came out, he was black, and they had a big problem saying
[1:27:54.480 --> 1:28:00.600]  white supremacist strike again, but have you been another incel type or whatever, oh my
[1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:05.480]  god, a white supremacist, whites are all able into the world, oh my gosh, meanwhile, over
[1:28:05.480 --> 1:28:09.320]  a million people in the last decade have died in Mexico and killings and murders at the hands
[1:28:09.320 --> 1:28:14.000]  of other Hispanics, now 100,000 last year are missing on the Texas-Mexico border, almost
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  all of them killed by the coyotes, like this man that was hung and killed.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:22.440]  He wasn't lynched by the white supremacist, he was lynched by the Hispanic coyotes, and
[1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:26.040]  they're not bashing Hispanic folks, it's Hispanic folks being killed by Hispanics, but that's
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:30.160]  the facts.
[1:28:30.160 --> 1:28:37.880]  Mr. Machete kills, unbelievable ladies and gentlemen, but they got you focused on a few
[1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:41.560]  shootings and focused on a few white supremacists, as if we're all killing each other when it's
[1:28:41.560 --> 1:28:45.640]  people killing people, and it's evil that's causing all this, we're gonna come back with
[1:28:45.640 --> 1:28:50.880]  your phone calls and the big news that is the top of GatewayPundit.com, I'm Alex Jones,
[1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:57.560]  stay with us.
[1:28:57.560 --> 1:29:03.120]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative, well for me, admitting I've
[1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:09.360]  gotten a rotten tooth and going into a root canal is not negative, it hurts, it stinks,
[1:29:09.360 --> 1:29:12.920]  it's got pus coming out of it, I go to the doctor, they fix it, that's not negative,
[1:29:12.920 --> 1:29:17.640]  I'm not living in denial, and so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection
[1:29:17.640 --> 1:29:21.960]  that we didn't feel yet, but now it's come to the surface, that's actually a positive
[1:29:21.960 --> 1:29:27.080]  thing, and so yeah, Trump did an overall great job, they stole the election, we can't get
[1:29:27.080 --> 1:29:33.560]  down about that, we have forced them out in the open, so now they're trying to suppress
[1:29:33.560 --> 1:29:37.880]  us because they know they've been exposed, they're scared, that's why, instead of saying
[1:29:37.880 --> 1:29:41.440]  oh we're a bunch of losers, look what happened, no we're a bunch of winners, they're trying
[1:29:41.440 --> 1:29:46.600]  to suppress us, let our light of truth shine, and tell everybody what's happening, your
[1:29:46.600 --> 1:29:51.400]  own website, your own show, my show, other articles, other videos, just keep sharing
[1:29:51.400 --> 1:29:55.760]  however you can and realize we're an information war, we're going to win this together, and
[1:29:55.760 --> 1:29:58.920]  the fight starts at infowars.com.
[1:29:58.920 --> 1:30:03.920]  Back in stock, down and out, liquid sleep support, it's been out of stock for a while,
[1:30:03.920 --> 1:30:09.080]  it's one of three sleep aids we have at infowarsstore.com, this one has been very popular, it's sold
[1:30:09.080 --> 1:30:15.640]  off the shelves, it's back in stock, down and out, liquid sleep support, this is probably
[1:30:15.640 --> 1:30:22.840]  the strongest sleep aid that we have, I would say, knockout, rocket rest, both great, comes
[1:30:22.840 --> 1:30:27.480]  in pill form, this is the liquid tincture, and I think this is probably the most powerful
[1:30:27.480 --> 1:30:28.480]  one.
[1:30:28.480 --> 1:30:32.960]  Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine, this is, if you haven't done an iodine challenge yet,
[1:30:32.960 --> 1:30:37.240]  have you haven't done the iodine challenge, what are you waiting for now is the time.
[1:30:37.240 --> 1:30:43.760]  Super male and super female vitality, living defense plus, and the organic greens fibercaps,
[1:30:43.760 --> 1:30:47.880]  we have a limited supply of these right now, but we want to sell them all out so we can
[1:30:47.880 --> 1:30:51.800]  order a new batch, it was very popular, the organic greens fibercaps, but we have all
[1:30:51.800 --> 1:30:57.280]  kinds of other great supplements that are great for so many different things, take advantage
[1:30:57.280 --> 1:30:58.280]  of those.
[1:30:58.280 --> 1:31:03.760]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021, and I just want to say something,
[1:31:03.760 --> 1:31:08.080]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[1:31:08.080 --> 1:31:12.400]  the years, it is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of
[1:31:12.400 --> 1:31:16.480]  you, the listeners of this show, I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you,
[1:31:16.480 --> 1:31:19.960]  whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter if you got
[1:31:19.960 --> 1:31:24.840]  red blood, and if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we
[1:31:24.840 --> 1:31:29.840]  are brothers and sisters together, and it has just been an incredible experience to
[1:31:29.840 --> 1:31:33.760]  work with you over the years, and as crazy as your things are, I want to keep working
[1:31:33.760 --> 1:31:39.080]  under the future, but again, that's really up to you and up to God, so please, I hope
[1:31:39.080 --> 1:31:44.160]  God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us, but again, that's
[1:31:44.160 --> 1:31:47.720]  up to you and your relationship with God, I just want to thank you all for the years
[1:31:47.720 --> 1:31:51.720]  of support you've given us and what you've done, and just ask you again to pray to God
[1:31:51.720 --> 1:31:56.040]  and ask what God's vision is for you, and hopefully God will touch your heart to continue
[1:31:56.040 --> 1:31:58.680]  to support him for worse, God bless.
[1:31:58.680 --> 1:32:04.080]  Could you imagine a year ago walking into a bank with your face covered?
[1:32:04.080 --> 1:32:07.800]  Could you imagine even going into the grocery store, do you think they would let you in?
[1:32:07.800 --> 1:32:10.560]  Do you think they would be following you in the aisles to make sure that you weren't
[1:32:10.560 --> 1:32:12.560]  going to be shoplifting?
[1:32:12.560 --> 1:32:18.240]  Could you imagine going up to a gas station and going inside the little mini-mart to pay
[1:32:18.240 --> 1:32:20.800]  for your gas with a bandana on?
[1:32:20.800 --> 1:32:22.480]  How far do you think that would get you?
[1:32:22.480 --> 1:32:26.880]  Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school with a shield that looks like a space
[1:32:26.880 --> 1:32:28.880]  alien?
[1:32:28.880 --> 1:32:35.800]  Those things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction.
[1:32:35.800 --> 1:32:39.600]  The globalists are running a psychological warfare operation on humanity.
[1:32:39.600 --> 1:32:43.080]  Only waking up to the great reset in its tyranny will save us.
[1:32:43.080 --> 1:32:45.360]  And the mask is the sign of slavery.
[1:32:45.360 --> 1:32:48.920]  We must inform the public that it's a fraud and that it's dangerous and that it causes
[1:32:48.920 --> 1:32:51.360]  major medical issues and it's dehumanizing.
[1:32:51.360 --> 1:32:52.840]  And the film COVID Land does that.
[1:32:52.840 --> 1:33:09.000]  Secure your copy now at covidland.com and get a free copy of the end game with your
[1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  friends.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:38.720]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:33:38.720 --> 1:33:44.160]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[1:33:44.160 --> 1:33:50.520]  All right, I want to go to your phone calls, Riley and Charlie and Cody and Nelson and
[1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:56.600]  Rick and Wayne and Kevin and Bob and so many others, toll free number 877-789-2539.
[1:33:56.600 --> 1:33:57.600]  Here's somebody hang up.
[1:33:57.600 --> 1:33:58.600]  That's your chance to get on.
[1:33:58.600 --> 1:34:00.160]  I'm sure you're all amazing callers.
[1:34:00.160 --> 1:34:03.200]  I'm just going to try to go to each person for a minute and a half or so because if I
[1:34:03.200 --> 1:34:06.120]  go long-winded with you and no matter how great you are, I'll never get to the next
[1:34:06.120 --> 1:34:07.120]  caller.
[1:34:07.120 --> 1:34:09.600]  It kind of ends up hurting everybody.
[1:34:09.600 --> 1:34:13.200]  But again, it's wide open phones, any subjects you want to raise, I just want to state one
[1:34:13.200 --> 1:34:14.200]  more thing.
[1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:17.560]  I'll take a bunch of calls and cover a bunch of more news I haven't gotten to next hour
[1:34:17.560 --> 1:34:19.920]  and the next hour after that.
[1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:23.400]  But the private central banks are totally ruthless.
[1:34:23.400 --> 1:34:27.440]  They've taken the world over by fractional reserve banking than derivatives and now global
[1:34:27.440 --> 1:34:32.400]  carbon tax system that will track and trace what you do and control what you can do.
[1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:33.400]  It's all now official.
[1:34:33.400 --> 1:34:34.400]  It's here.
[1:34:34.400 --> 1:34:36.260]  It's not coming.
[1:34:36.260 --> 1:34:41.520]  They mean to use this to artificially shut down development in the world and starve the
[1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:46.240]  third world to death but let some of them escape and overwhelm the first world because
[1:34:46.240 --> 1:34:51.400]  the U.N. will then direct those giant migrant flows that are to be bigger than the indigenous
[1:34:51.400 --> 1:34:53.520]  population inside the country.
[1:34:53.520 --> 1:35:00.840]  The U.N. report from 2001 says by 2050, they want 600 plus million people in the U.S.
[1:35:00.840 --> 1:35:07.520]  No, 600 million to migrate to the U.S. so the U.S. would be close to a billion people
[1:35:07.520 --> 1:35:11.680]  and it talks about 200 million from Africa alone just in France.
[1:35:11.680 --> 1:35:15.520]  This type of replacement migration will be on the U.N. website.
[1:35:15.520 --> 1:35:18.960]  Here we are 20 years later and we're living.
[1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:27.280]  So the big banks are flooding everything with currency right now to buy up real assets before
[1:35:27.280 --> 1:35:30.640]  they implode it leaving us with the debt, the devaluation and then bringing in their
[1:35:30.640 --> 1:35:33.040]  new digital currency that totally controls us.
[1:35:33.040 --> 1:35:34.040]  This is not a good scenario.
[1:35:34.040 --> 1:35:40.760]  This is a market to be scenario and things you do now will affect you greatly in the
[1:35:40.760 --> 1:35:42.920]  future to be able to survive.
[1:35:42.920 --> 1:35:46.440]  If you don't get ready, you will be starved to death in the future.
[1:35:46.440 --> 1:35:48.080]  This is a long-term decade game.
[1:35:48.080 --> 1:35:51.920]  They want to be massively depopulating by 2030.
[1:35:51.920 --> 1:35:55.960]  They already are but this is all just testing it, seeing if we buy it, seeing if we go along
[1:35:55.960 --> 1:35:57.880]  with it.
[1:35:57.880 --> 1:36:01.720]  If we identify the globalists, if we identify they're behind COVID-19, if they start getting
[1:36:01.720 --> 1:36:06.680]  arrested, if everybody wakes up to their agenda, even a large portion will do it, of the great
[1:36:06.680 --> 1:36:11.160]  reset, how they operate, how they, it's over, it's what they want us off air.
[1:36:11.160 --> 1:36:14.040]  But if people don't get this as a new type of war, it's over.
[1:36:14.040 --> 1:36:18.400]  And that's why it's so good that Gateway Pundit has link to what we did in the emergency
[1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:20.920]  broadcast Monday night.
[1:36:20.920 --> 1:36:23.480]  And if we can, let's pull up that emergency broadcast for Monday night.
[1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:29.360]  I don't know how many views it's got now on Bandai Video, but it had like 600,000 when
[1:36:29.360 --> 1:36:31.360]  I saw it last night.
[1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:34.280]  It needs 50 million.
[1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:40.480]  I mean, it's Fauci on TV with the head of HHS bragging about releasing bio weapons.
[1:36:40.480 --> 1:36:43.840]  So it's up to a million six since last night.
[1:36:43.840 --> 1:36:44.840]  That's great.
[1:36:44.840 --> 1:36:45.840]  We're 10% away to 10 million.
[1:36:45.840 --> 1:36:47.200]  We need 100 million.
[1:36:47.200 --> 1:36:52.200]  Monday night emergency broadcast, video emerges of Fauci and his HHS plotting to stage massive
[1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:54.600]  health scare using new virus.
[1:36:54.600 --> 1:36:56.120]  Gateway Pundit does a better job.
[1:36:56.120 --> 1:37:00.960]  They put out a very short boil down of the 40 minute video that's in their article.
[1:37:00.960 --> 1:37:02.880]  They link to our larger one.
[1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:09.520]  Explosive video emerges of Fauci and HHS officials plotting for a new avian flu virus to enforce
[1:37:09.520 --> 1:37:13.560]  universal flu vaccination video.
[1:37:13.560 --> 1:37:16.840]  Now why do you think they're doing for the first time in a case like this where people
[1:37:16.840 --> 1:37:21.920]  actually showed up and did depositions and gave people the evidence, gave them the discovery
[1:37:21.920 --> 1:37:23.560]  when they gave us nothing in Texas?
[1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:26.040]  Why would they say you don't get a trial?
[1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:28.600]  Because they want us shut down.
[1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:29.840]  They want us closed.
[1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:30.840]  Everybody's ringing my phones off the hook.
[1:37:30.840 --> 1:37:32.160]  We're going to still be on air.
[1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:35.360]  Well, they still have to have the kangaroo operation.
[1:37:35.360 --> 1:37:37.480]  They already have a kangaroo show trial in my view doing this.
[1:37:37.480 --> 1:37:41.640]  So I would imagine they're going to try to seat a kangaroo jury to decide how much I
[1:37:41.640 --> 1:37:42.640]  owe.
[1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:44.600]  See, it's not your guilty until proven innocent.
[1:37:44.600 --> 1:37:46.560]  It's no, no, it's not innocent until proven guilty.
[1:37:46.560 --> 1:37:47.560]  It's supposed to be.
[1:37:47.560 --> 1:37:48.800]  It's your guilty.
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:53.280]  And then now we're going to decide how guilty from a political operative that's been reversed
[1:37:53.280 --> 1:37:57.160]  by the Texas Supreme Court that tried to block the Texas abortion law and a bunch of other
[1:37:57.160 --> 1:37:58.160]  stuff.
[1:37:58.160 --> 1:37:59.360]  A Soros minion.
[1:37:59.360 --> 1:38:06.680]  I take that as an extreme badge of courage that I've got the radical leftist operatives
[1:38:06.680 --> 1:38:10.280]  seeing me as the enemy.
[1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:11.680]  I mean, I expect that.
[1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:13.840]  That's why John Hancock signed his name so big.
[1:38:13.840 --> 1:38:15.240]  I mean, I'm not looking for the trouble.
[1:38:15.240 --> 1:38:19.880]  I don't enjoy it, but I expect it.
[1:38:19.880 --> 1:38:24.520]  So all I ask is for you to keep us on air and you will continue to see us deliver, deliver,
[1:38:24.520 --> 1:38:25.520]  deliver, deliver.
[1:38:25.520 --> 1:38:31.840]  Thanks to God, empowering us and giving me the discernment and the direction and the will
[1:38:31.840 --> 1:38:32.840]  to do this.
[1:38:32.840 --> 1:38:38.880]  And people can notice that I've upped my energy and my focus and my clarity because I have
[1:38:38.880 --> 1:38:43.640]  absolutely got on my knees and asked God to hold me up and I'm asking you to pray for
[1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:47.640]  me to hold me up and I pray for you that we all be held up and be strong against the enemy
[1:38:47.640 --> 1:38:53.160]  that God hold us up in the face of this onslaught, empower us.
[1:38:53.160 --> 1:38:59.240]  And so it's a hell of a time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen, and it's time to get
[1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:00.920]  close to God.
[1:39:00.920 --> 1:39:01.920]  Very important article.
[1:39:01.920 --> 1:39:03.400]  We'll go to your calls.
[1:39:03.400 --> 1:39:08.640]  Explosive video emerges of Fauci and HHS officials plotting for a new avian flu virus to enforce
[1:39:08.640 --> 1:39:10.120]  universal flu vaccination.
[1:39:10.120 --> 1:39:13.760]  See, what happens if you get excited about this video?
[1:39:13.760 --> 1:39:14.760]  What happens to others?
[1:39:14.760 --> 1:39:18.120]  Do you see, they can take you off YouTube or Twitter or Facebook, but they've got band
[1:39:18.120 --> 1:39:24.720]  dot video to deal with and rumble and gab and others who are all under massive attack.
[1:39:24.720 --> 1:39:29.520]  Congressional hearings about us all wanting us all silenced.
[1:39:29.520 --> 1:39:30.520]  Wanting to silence the blaze.
[1:39:30.520 --> 1:39:32.040]  Got a lot of good hosts over there.
[1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:34.160]  Bex gotten a lot better and woken up.
[1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:36.160]  You Tucker Carlson awake.
[1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:37.160]  Joe Rogan awake.
[1:39:37.160 --> 1:39:40.160]  You see the next few podcasts coming out tomorrow and the next day.
[1:39:40.160 --> 1:39:42.760]  I'm not going to tell you who's going to be on, but it's going to be big.
[1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:44.440]  I'll just leave it at that.
[1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:49.960]  So so much happening, ladies and gentlemen, so much going on as people realize that they're
[1:39:49.960 --> 1:39:54.560]  going to lose everything and they don't fight this and realizing it's just as evil as Alex
[1:39:54.560 --> 1:39:55.800]  Jones said it was.
[1:39:55.800 --> 1:39:58.640]  And then some more.
[1:39:58.640 --> 1:39:59.640]  And then some.
[1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:04.640]  So Alex Jones of info wars made a special broadcast on Monday night regarding an explosive
[1:40:04.640 --> 1:40:10.400]  video of Fauci and his HHS officials and other health experts discussing how to enforce
[1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:16.200]  universal flu vaccination in a summit organized by Milken Institute of Washington, D.C.
[1:40:16.200 --> 1:40:17.320]  And they're talking about flu earlier.
[1:40:17.320 --> 1:40:22.080]  He goes on to say we need something like a bird virus out of China.
[1:40:22.080 --> 1:40:28.880]  That's that that's actually covered goes on Alex Jones highlighted three clips from the
[1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:33.000]  hour long video of the summit's really 40 minutes, but he threw on some nurses and their
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.680]  testimony at the end, but it's an hour, I guess, get total.
[1:40:35.680 --> 1:40:40.520]  Alex Jones highlighted three clips from the hour long video of the summit from C span,
[1:40:40.520 --> 1:40:45.840]  which proved the COVID-19 pandemic was planned and that Big Pharma worked with the U.N. and
[1:40:45.840 --> 1:40:49.640]  other corrupt government officials to develop and release the COVID-19 virus ahead of the
[1:40:49.640 --> 1:40:51.600]  great reset.
[1:40:51.600 --> 1:40:56.760]  The first clip featured Michael Specter, a journalist is a specter, all right, from the
[1:40:56.760 --> 1:41:01.520]  New Yorker and also an adjunct professor of bioengineering at Stanford University, Anthony
[1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:05.960]  Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy Infectious Diseases and Rick Bright,
[1:41:05.960 --> 1:41:12.560]  the director of HHS Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.
[1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:18.760]  In the video, they conceptualize having a new outbreak of a novel avian flu virus from
[1:41:18.760 --> 1:41:23.960]  China so they can bypass the method of the approval and enforce mRNA vaccine to the
[1:41:23.960 --> 1:41:25.120]  masses.
[1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:30.160]  And it goes through all the quotes and everything else for you.
[1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:35.040]  Thank you so much because I stayed up here till eight at night with a non-salazar, writing
[1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:39.600]  a little blurb and getting it out with some of the crew, but they took it and made it
[1:41:39.600 --> 1:41:40.600]  even better.
[1:41:40.600 --> 1:41:44.120]  So thank you, Gateway Pundit, go to gatewaypundit.com and get it out.
[1:41:44.120 --> 1:41:46.880]  Thank you for fighting with us, we're fighting with you.
[1:41:46.880 --> 1:41:47.880]  We are together.
[1:41:47.880 --> 1:41:50.400]  I'm not in competition with the Gateway Pundit, I'm not in competition with Tucker Carlson,
[1:41:50.400 --> 1:41:53.520]  I'm not in competition with Joe Rogan, I'm not in competition with any of these people.
[1:41:53.520 --> 1:41:55.440]  I'm in competition with evil.
[1:41:55.440 --> 1:41:56.440]  I want to stop it.
[1:41:56.440 --> 1:42:00.440]  I'm in competition with those that want to kill me and my family and he populate me
[1:42:00.440 --> 1:42:01.440]  and we are going to defeat them.
[1:42:01.440 --> 1:42:02.440]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[1:42:02.440 --> 1:42:06.600]  Then I promise we're going to write two of your phone calls on the other side and then
[1:42:06.600 --> 1:42:12.560]  for the next two hours after that, bam, bam, bam, but in the third hour, OAN has got this
[1:42:12.560 --> 1:42:18.080]  one particular talk show host and analyst.
[1:42:18.080 --> 1:42:23.680]  He is Pearson Sharp and I recorded him like two weeks ago saying some stuff about COVID
[1:42:23.680 --> 1:42:27.560]  that was really well done and true and then again, today I was getting a coffee where
[1:42:27.560 --> 1:42:30.880]  I went live and he was on there again, knocking out of the park and so I want to play some
[1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:39.240]  clips of this guy, yeah, woo, more soldiers, more leaders rising, more people engaging
[1:42:39.240 --> 1:42:42.760]  as they figure out how real this is and I just keep seeing these amazing men and women
[1:42:42.760 --> 1:42:50.560]  pop up and in many cases outpace me and that's my job, become obsolete and grow old watching
[1:42:50.560 --> 1:42:54.120]  the globalists defeated, but something tells me that's not what's going to happen.
[1:42:54.120 --> 1:42:57.600]  Don't be defeated, but I don't think I'll be growing old to you.
[1:42:57.600 --> 1:43:03.880]  The engineers at BioProse are very excited to announce a major expansion of new products
[1:43:03.880 --> 1:43:06.680]  into the retail consumer market.
[1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:10.600]  Since their rollout of their first product almost a year ago, they come out with four
[1:43:10.600 --> 1:43:20.520]  new products, BioDrain Pro, BioRV Pro, BioMarine Pro and BioPortaPro for decades.
[1:43:20.520 --> 1:43:26.560]  Oil companies and other major chemical corporations have been using patented naturally occurring
[1:43:26.560 --> 1:43:33.040]  specially bred bacteria to eat oil spills and other toxic waste disasters.
[1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:36.680]  That's how powerful these naturally occurring microbes are.
[1:43:36.680 --> 1:43:42.200]  The BioPro system is light years better than traditional enzymes that only work once.
[1:43:42.200 --> 1:43:47.360]  These bacteria begin to breed and live in your septic tank and now it's available for
[1:43:47.360 --> 1:43:52.960]  the general public's use for the first time on the retail market exclusively available
[1:43:52.960 --> 1:43:57.400]  at TheBioProse.com.
[1:43:57.400 --> 1:43:59.160]  I got some good news.
[1:43:59.160 --> 1:44:05.360]  All the items in front of me are back in stock and are 40 to 50% off and in FullWarsHore.com.
[1:44:05.360 --> 1:44:08.720]  The bad news is a lot of them are about to sell out.
[1:44:08.720 --> 1:44:13.360]  So this sale is only going from one week starting on September 29th and in the case of green
[1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:18.800]  fiber capsules, these will be sold out in just a couple of days, 50% off.
[1:44:18.800 --> 1:44:21.200]  We have knockout sleep aid, 50% off.
[1:44:21.200 --> 1:44:25.320]  Sold out for months, very popular, twice as strong as knockout, probably too strong for
[1:44:25.320 --> 1:44:30.480]  some people, totally different formula, down and out is back in stock, 50% off.
[1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:35.520]  We've extended the sale on Winter Sun and Ultra 12, 50% off and also on Deep Earth Crystal
[1:44:35.520 --> 1:44:37.520]  iodine survival show X2.
[1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:41.040]  It's all 40 and 50% off for one week only.
[1:44:41.040 --> 1:44:45.760]  Take advantage of it and fund the info war and I thank you all for your support, infowarshore.com
[1:44:45.760 --> 1:44:49.640]  or triple eight, two five three, three one three nine.
[1:44:49.640 --> 1:44:50.640]  It's a win-win.
[1:44:50.640 --> 1:44:54.680]  These are things that make you healthy, make your life better and they fund the info war.
[1:44:54.680 --> 1:44:59.320]  Again, the only way we lose is if you don't take action right now.
[1:44:59.320 --> 1:45:04.040]  If your ruthless mega corporations have taken over almost every government on earth and
[1:45:04.040 --> 1:45:09.080]  who are trying to destroy the middle class in any form of operability, you've got to
[1:45:09.080 --> 1:45:12.920]  divide and conquer the public so they don't know they're being targeted.
[1:45:12.920 --> 1:45:18.840]  That's why the Fortune 100 have wrapped themselves, the name of LBGT and African American rights
[1:45:18.840 --> 1:45:21.360]  and all the rest of it, all over the world.
[1:45:21.360 --> 1:45:25.360]  That's now their corporate face while they run slave camps in Africa and in communist
[1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:30.280]  China and many other areas, while they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through
[1:45:30.280 --> 1:45:33.120]  the big tech and the central banks and other zone.
[1:45:33.120 --> 1:45:39.760]  So this is a criminal takeover and when you look at the new super class, it's the politicians,
[1:45:39.760 --> 1:45:44.360]  it's the corporate media, it's the police, it's the bureaucrats, it's members of Congress
[1:45:44.360 --> 1:45:48.680]  and their staff and their families, it's the White House, hell it's postal workers who
[1:45:48.680 --> 1:45:54.400]  were all exempt from the poison shots but not the general public and everybody else
[1:45:54.400 --> 1:45:56.080]  through corporate rule.
[1:45:56.080 --> 1:46:00.520]  So this is the true discrimination that's going on.
[1:46:00.520 --> 1:46:05.120]  I want to explain something that is absolutely heat understanding our world, it's very, very
[1:46:05.120 --> 1:46:07.560]  simple but the most people don't know.
[1:46:07.560 --> 1:46:14.280]  The privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions
[1:46:14.280 --> 1:46:20.840]  of dollars and other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual
[1:46:20.840 --> 1:46:27.520]  property, energy, they're using it to buy people, to buy influence and in the past they
[1:46:27.520 --> 1:46:32.240]  created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that manipulate markets but
[1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:36.280]  they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause
[1:46:36.280 --> 1:46:37.280]  massive inflation.
[1:46:37.280 --> 1:46:42.400]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy
[1:46:42.400 --> 1:46:48.360]  buying up everything, not to have the companies operate but to actually shut them down and
[1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:53.160]  force a collapse of civilization, making the companies they do fund the only things left
[1:46:53.160 --> 1:46:54.160]  standing.
[1:46:54.160 --> 1:47:01.680]  The Great Reset, this is what's happening now, warn everyone it's the only way to stop it.
[1:47:01.680 --> 1:47:29.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:38.760]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the Alex Jones show, it's not supposed to exist but
[1:47:38.760 --> 1:47:44.360]  because of you it does, so while you still can, the twilight of the republic, maybe it's
[1:47:44.360 --> 1:47:48.320]  the dawn, it's up to you.
[1:47:48.320 --> 1:47:53.160]  Share the article, share the video, share the links from freeworldnews.tv, infowars.com,
[1:47:53.160 --> 1:47:54.160]  band.video.
[1:47:54.160 --> 1:47:59.680]  Okay, we're going to go to your phone calls and I forgot, I said to the crew no guest
[1:47:59.680 --> 1:48:05.000]  today a few days ago because I had a special guest flying in and I meant to have time to
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:08.280]  make sure they could be on and I wasn't sure what time they'd be able to fly in because
[1:48:08.280 --> 1:48:12.800]  they were having to change some flights and then I was wondering today why, why do I have
[1:48:12.800 --> 1:48:17.960]  no guests you know I'm hosting all four hours and I sat there and I thought and I didn't
[1:48:17.960 --> 1:48:22.680]  know why and I said well we'll click in my head in a minute and then Bob Barnes just
[1:48:22.680 --> 1:48:26.360]  walked through the door five minutes ago.
[1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:32.440]  One of the smartest guys I know, a great patriot, so we will open the phones up now and right
[1:48:32.440 --> 1:48:35.880]  through the next hour, so everybody on the board will get to you and more and then we're
[1:48:35.880 --> 1:48:40.280]  going to have Bob Barnes here and he's got a lot to talk about and hell he'll probably
[1:48:40.280 --> 1:48:44.360]  want to open the phones up as well and I am going to play those clips also mentioned of
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:48.760]  a Pearson Sharp and what he's been saying that's over the top, smart and informative.
[1:48:48.760 --> 1:48:54.320]  So right now thank you for holding, I really appreciate everybody holding and calling
[1:48:54.320 --> 1:48:55.320]  in.
[1:48:55.320 --> 1:48:58.200]  The board at the calls have been received.
[1:48:58.200 --> 1:49:03.360]  Charlie is in FEMA region five, let's talk about Stockholm syndrome, COVID mandates
[1:49:03.360 --> 1:49:05.040]  and protests globally.
[1:49:05.040 --> 1:49:06.040]  Thank you Charlie, go ahead.
[1:49:06.040 --> 1:49:09.440]  Yes sir, yes sir, brother Jones, how are you?
[1:49:09.440 --> 1:49:12.640]  I'm great talking to you, every day above ground is a great day.
[1:49:12.640 --> 1:49:20.240]  Nice, nice, I agree, well like you were saying you know with, I've seen them, I feel they're
[1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:25.640]  in the green that had a video about Australia and the protests and all that good stuff and
[1:49:25.640 --> 1:49:30.600]  I just see masses of people, horrors of people just flooding the streets and I'm just thinking
[1:49:30.600 --> 1:49:35.720]  to myself, when is that going to happen in the USA, like I don't see that happening here.
[1:49:35.720 --> 1:49:40.080]  I mean if this is supposedly, you know, there's lots of patriots, whatever, a hundred million
[1:49:40.080 --> 1:49:44.920]  that's yet to be vaccinated, then where are those people taking to the streets?
[1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:49.600]  Well what's happening is things aren't as bad here yet but they're planning on doing
[1:49:49.600 --> 1:49:53.960]  that in their own documents, their own admissions, the Senate's had introduced bills to block
[1:49:53.960 --> 1:49:58.160]  Biden creating domestic checkpoints so we're getting there, there's been some big demonstrations
[1:49:58.160 --> 1:50:03.200]  in New York and California and all over, just the media doesn't cover it and big tech blocks
[1:50:03.200 --> 1:50:07.800]  it, but it doesn't matter, the people still get out there together but I hear you, we
[1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:13.000]  need everybody, hell I've been demonstrating for 20 months, you know, since February of
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:18.040]  last year but you're right, we need to do more and I, you know, I tell you what, coming
[1:50:18.040 --> 1:50:22.760]  up towards the end of October, we need to have a demonstration against future lockdowns
[1:50:22.760 --> 1:50:27.000]  because they're certainly trying them and against mass mandates of children and so
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:31.360]  let's just pick a date, by the end of the show I'll pick a date for us to have a demonstration
[1:50:31.360 --> 1:50:35.960]  downtown Austin and we'll march down the road peacefully but we may do some civil disobedience,
[1:50:35.960 --> 1:50:40.880]  go ahead and block some roads and see what happens, so great points, thank you Charlie.
[1:50:40.880 --> 1:50:45.920]  Alright, let's take another caller, let's talk to Wayne in Washington, Wayne, welcome
[1:50:45.920 --> 1:50:50.560]  your wife's a nurse, being forced to get facts or lose the job, that's what you say.
[1:50:50.560 --> 1:50:55.200]  That's right Alex, yeah hey Alex, I just want to tell you, we pray for you every day, you
[1:50:55.200 --> 1:51:00.280]  are, you're the man, that's all I can say, my wife was pretty downhearted yesterday when
[1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:05.800]  she came home from work so I played her that Ted Newsend clip and that definitely lifted
[1:51:05.800 --> 1:51:12.160]  her spirits there, Ted's always great but Ted was just, you could feel the energy and
[1:51:12.160 --> 1:51:17.160]  commitment and anger there but very controlled, Ted, that was the best, yeah.
[1:51:17.160 --> 1:51:24.520]  Yes sir, yeah, you know they had her, they had her, had a document that they sent home
[1:51:24.520 --> 1:51:29.600]  that was a religious exemption and we have been devout Christians, we love the Lord,
[1:51:29.600 --> 1:51:36.760]  we love Jesus and she spent days and evenings going through the two or three pages that
[1:51:36.760 --> 1:51:42.760]  she had typed up and articles and then after she turned that information and they said
[1:51:42.760 --> 1:51:51.520]  oh well, well that's fine but still it doesn't matter, nobody's going to work in this clinic
[1:51:51.520 --> 1:51:56.440]  unless they've had two doctors that are leaving as well, actually one's already left.
[1:51:56.440 --> 1:52:01.520]  Sir, that's the process, is doctors and nurses that want freedom have to get together and
[1:52:01.520 --> 1:52:09.800]  form your own clinics, my wife's cousin, they funded this school for generations, private
[1:52:09.800 --> 1:52:14.200]  school in Omaha and they said that all the teachers have to be given injections and
[1:52:14.200 --> 1:52:17.880]  that all the kids have to wear masks and so they pulled out about the third of the kids
[1:52:17.880 --> 1:52:21.720]  left and they ended up getting a building down the street and they're all having great
[1:52:21.720 --> 1:52:27.280]  school there so the answer is pull out of it but if she wants to fight it, she can say
[1:52:27.280 --> 1:52:31.000]  you have no right to violate my First Amendment and say if my religious exemption is good
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:36.400]  or not, A, B, it violates the Nuremberg Code and C, that hospital or clinic won't give
[1:52:36.400 --> 1:52:39.920]  her the shot, they're going to make them go to a Walmart or a CVS that's been given
[1:52:39.920 --> 1:52:43.760]  liability protection, they won't even give it so have them give her the shot at the
[1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:48.800]  clinic and have them sign a waiver that they have liability, they won't do it and if she
[1:52:48.800 --> 1:52:52.840]  tells them okay, I'm going to sue you, they'll probably back off but we need to start pushing
[1:52:52.840 --> 1:52:53.840]  back, okay?
[1:52:53.840 --> 1:52:57.080]  Absolutely, thank you Alex so much.
[1:52:57.080 --> 1:52:58.080]  Anything else brother?
[1:52:58.080 --> 1:52:59.080]  You got a question or comment?
[1:52:59.080 --> 1:53:06.360]  I just want to say the other thing, I'm a grandfather of five and my daughter is homeschooling,
[1:53:06.360 --> 1:53:11.160]  the kids are absolutely brilliant, as a matter of fact, the last three of her babies we've
[1:53:11.160 --> 1:53:16.640]  had at home with midwives so we don't do hospitals.
[1:53:16.640 --> 1:53:22.280]  I'm a pancreatic cancer survivor, I'll be 10 years cancer free next Tuesday.
[1:53:22.280 --> 1:53:25.480]  Congratulations, for folks that don't know, that's one of the rarest ones to survive,
[1:53:25.480 --> 1:53:26.480]  how'd you do it?
[1:53:26.480 --> 1:53:30.480]  I'm a 2% survivor Alex, 10 years out.
[1:53:30.480 --> 1:53:31.480]  How'd you do it sir?
[1:53:31.480 --> 1:53:37.720]  Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ did it, that's the only way I did it, I can't take any credit
[1:53:37.720 --> 1:53:42.560]  for doing that, I guess I'm one of these busy big guys that have no off switch, kind of
[1:53:42.560 --> 1:53:49.120]  like you and so my attitude in my head was, I don't have time for this, I have things
[1:53:49.120 --> 1:53:56.320]  to do and my prayers and my family's prayers and prayers of our friends is how I did it.
[1:53:56.320 --> 1:54:00.520]  Beautiful Wayne, thanks for the call, all right, let's go to Cody in California, welcome
[1:54:00.520 --> 1:54:01.520]  Cody.
[1:54:01.520 --> 1:54:02.520]  Hello?
[1:54:02.520 --> 1:54:03.520]  Yes sir.
[1:54:03.520 --> 1:54:05.320]  Yes, how you doing Alex?
[1:54:05.320 --> 1:54:10.240]  I was calling about yesterday, I took my wife to the emergency room and the security guard
[1:54:10.240 --> 1:54:14.160]  stopped me at first, she said, well, you can't go in there, you gotta go back out, only your
[1:54:14.160 --> 1:54:18.000]  wife patients can go into the hospital, I said why she stopped the season, I have a
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:21.960]  magnet, she have a BNS, I have to swipe her, so she let me go into the back, so we go in
[1:54:21.960 --> 1:54:25.400]  the back of the hospital, all the nurses do what was going on, so one nurse was in the
[1:54:25.400 --> 1:54:30.560]  room with us, she was like have you been tested positive for COVID, I said no, then she said
[1:54:30.560 --> 1:54:35.200]  have you have the vaccine, I said no, so she said you have to leave the hospital, you can't
[1:54:35.200 --> 1:54:40.320]  be back here, I said why not, she said because you haven't been tested, so she came back
[1:54:40.320 --> 1:54:43.960]  and left, she bought me a chair, she said we don't have a chair for you, so we don't
[1:54:43.960 --> 1:54:48.560]  allow people back here, it is fair that you be back here and all these thousands of doctors
[1:54:48.560 --> 1:54:51.840]  at Kaiser and I lost their job and the nurses lost their job because they want to take the
[1:54:51.840 --> 1:54:55.960]  shot and you're still back here, that's not fair, but then she went later on, she went
[1:54:55.960 --> 1:55:00.640]  and talked to a supervisor, said you've got to leave, so I said well first of all, I told
[1:55:00.640 --> 1:55:05.200]  her first of all, you're the one that's spreading the vaccine, the people that got the shot
[1:55:05.200 --> 1:55:08.600]  knocked me out, I'm helping and she doesn't have to be alone after that.
[1:55:08.600 --> 1:55:12.960]  Absolutely, you've got to push back and that's what all the medical doctors I've had on,
[1:55:12.960 --> 1:55:16.400]  you've got a demand of your families in there that they get hydroxychloroquine, that they
[1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:23.640]  get ivermectin, that they get vitamin C, you say you'll pay for it and again, they need
[1:55:23.640 --> 1:55:26.800]  budesidine, sir, but how's your wife doing now?
[1:55:26.800 --> 1:55:30.360]  Oh, she's doing good, she had to go get stitches, that's the only reason, she didn't want to
[1:55:30.360 --> 1:55:33.840]  go to the hospital, I don't want to go, I don't want to get COVID, I don't want to be called
[1:55:33.840 --> 1:55:37.240]  ambulance, she said no, I don't want to go in an ambulance, I don't want to get COVID
[1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:40.480]  so when we got there, she was bleeding and everything and it took us like almost right
[1:55:40.480 --> 1:55:41.480]  away.
[1:55:41.480 --> 1:55:44.080]  Well, your wife's smart, the place you don't want to be is the hospital folks.
[1:55:44.080 --> 1:55:47.880]  Right, right, yeah, because I was looking at the lady, she kept bothering me, the nurse
[1:55:47.880 --> 1:55:51.800]  kept coming back bothering me, oh, you've got to leave, you can't be back, it ain't
[1:55:51.800 --> 1:55:55.240]  fair to you, it's not fair to the other workers because other workers have lost their jobs
[1:55:55.240 --> 1:55:59.560]  so they wouldn't take the shot, I got so tired of her, I was angry, I was like, look, I said
[1:55:59.560 --> 1:56:04.000]  you're the one transmitted, you got the shot, y'all, and she's not by there, left me alone.
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  Beautiful sir, thank you, Cody.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:08.280]  All right, we're going to go to break in a few minutes and I'm going to come back with
[1:56:08.280 --> 1:56:13.760]  Bob, Kevin, Jim, Scott, Brian, Larry, Stan, Riley, all of you, did a pretty good job,
[1:56:13.760 --> 1:56:16.560]  took like what four calls that segment, we're going to come back, we're just going to take
[1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:20.520]  call after call after call, and then I've got some of the other news here we haven't
[1:56:20.520 --> 1:56:28.000]  gotten to, what is 2SLGBTQQIA+, we'll tell you about that coming up, and Merritt Garland's
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:33.240]  got caught in some big trouble along with the former head of one of the major federal
[1:56:33.240 --> 1:56:39.240]  agencies for being involved with the creation of COVID-19, we've got that for you coming
[1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:40.240]  up separately.
[1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:44.160]  Please remember, we can't stay on the air without your help, plus we've got great products
[1:56:44.160 --> 1:56:45.640]  you and your family need.
[1:56:45.640 --> 1:56:51.560]  DNA Force Plus sold out for six months, back in stock with the PQQ, the CoQ10, the highest
[1:56:51.560 --> 1:56:54.320]  quality of that, there's just some other stuff out there that's synthetic that's basically
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:57:03.240]  worthless, Organic Reishi, ELV, ATP, Astragalus, Root Extract, and even more, and this stuff
[1:57:03.240 --> 1:57:07.880]  cleans out your mitochondria, cleans out your cells, gets the garbage out, the platinum
[1:57:07.880 --> 1:57:14.120]  super diamond jewel in the crown standard for your immune system, the telomeres can
[1:57:14.120 --> 1:57:18.720]  even regrow damaged nerves, I mean, you're about to say that about PQQ and CoQ10, especially
[1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:25.880]  the PQQ, so it all works together synergistically, and little bitty bottles of these cost as
[1:57:25.880 --> 1:57:32.000]  much as this does when it's the real stuff, InfowarsStore.com, it's 40% off, and we've
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:38.880]  got Brainforce Ultra, again, about to sell out, it's still discounted, InfowarsStore.com,
[1:57:38.880 --> 1:57:44.160]  and Ultra 12, and Winter Sun, 50% off, that's going to end soon as well, we'll be right
[1:57:44.160 --> 1:57:47.440]  back with hour number three.
[1:57:47.440 --> 1:57:52.080]  If you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under now is bad, wait till they've
[1:57:52.080 --> 1:57:58.040]  got their World ID, and that's exactly what the COVID passports are all about, and Cloud
[1:57:58.040 --> 1:58:04.000]  Swab and the UN, and all the other globalist leaders own words they admit, that once they've
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:09.440]  got you with that system, then they're going to carbon tax you everywhere you go and track
[1:58:09.440 --> 1:58:14.320]  what you do, and publicly they're saying they're going to decide when you can travel and when
[1:58:14.320 --> 1:58:19.640]  you can't travel, and MasterCard and all the other big companies are currently announcing
[1:58:19.640 --> 1:58:24.960]  they're going to track what you do and where you go and tax you with a carbon tax for it.
[1:58:24.960 --> 1:58:28.560]  This is the holy grail of tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:58:28.560 --> 1:58:31.720]  This is the takeover, in humanity, better wake up and say no.
[1:58:31.720 --> 1:58:35.240]  Finally, folks are starting to wake up, Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, others are leaving
[1:58:35.240 --> 1:58:38.000]  the charge, along with Infowars, but it's not enough.
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:42.040]  Every individual has to not comply, and we have to talk about bringing the globalists
[1:58:42.040 --> 1:58:43.040]  to justice.
[1:58:43.040 --> 1:58:48.440]  You see, they need the fear of God put in them legally and lawfully.
[1:58:48.440 --> 1:58:53.080]  People ask me, Alex, why did you come out with a new natural organic sleep aid when
[1:58:53.080 --> 1:58:57.040]  you already have knockout that works so well with eight natural ingredients?
[1:58:57.040 --> 1:59:01.920]  Well, because when you've taken a certain organic blend for a decade, like I've taken
[1:59:01.920 --> 1:59:05.080]  this product I came up with, it doesn't work as well anymore.
[1:59:05.080 --> 1:59:06.080]  That's the way herbs work.
[1:59:06.080 --> 1:59:09.720]  You go off it a while, come back on it, it works again.
[1:59:09.720 --> 1:59:10.720]  So what did I do?
[1:59:10.720 --> 1:59:13.880]  I went to the developers and I said, make a totally different formula with a lot of other
[1:59:13.880 --> 1:59:17.520]  known natural healthy compounds that make you sleep deep and restful, because that's
[1:59:17.520 --> 1:59:21.920]  what helps your immune system, and I want it to be at least twice as strong as knockout.
[1:59:21.920 --> 1:59:24.200]  Okay, be careful when you take it.
[1:59:24.200 --> 1:59:25.520]  It's incredibly strong.
[1:59:25.520 --> 1:59:26.520]  It's named down and out.
[1:59:26.520 --> 1:59:30.400]  I don't have time to get into all the ingredients in it, but it is extremely strong, and we
[1:59:30.400 --> 1:59:31.920]  are extremely proud of it.
[1:59:31.920 --> 1:59:37.920]  It is exclusively available at infowarstore.com, 50% off right now.
[1:59:37.920 --> 1:59:39.240]  Sold out for more than four months.
[1:59:39.240 --> 1:59:44.200]  Now back at stock, get your down and out, and your knockout at infowarstore.com today.
[1:59:44.200 --> 1:59:51.680]  I think if you're a support, because it keeps us on the air.
[1:59:51.680 --> 2:00:06.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show, and it's time for humanity to stand up in the
[2:00:06.080 --> 2:00:10.120]  info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want
[2:00:10.120 --> 2:00:19.040]  to fight, you better believe you got one from the front lines of the information war, it's
[2:00:19.040 --> 2:00:45.160]  Alex Jones.
[2:00:45.160 --> 2:00:51.800]  At this point, anyone who isn't an imbecile or mentally disturbed has figured out that
[2:00:51.800 --> 2:00:56.960]  COVID-19 is the biggest fraud of our lifetime.
[2:00:56.960 --> 2:01:02.640]  Several nations figured this out months ago and have mandated the life saving ivermectin
[2:01:02.640 --> 2:01:07.200]  protocol with consistently outstanding results.
[2:01:07.200 --> 2:01:11.880]  Multiple countries distributed packets to all of their citizens with everything they
[2:01:11.880 --> 2:01:22.400]  need to survive the asymptomatic virus with an already 99% survival rate known as SARS-CoV-2.
[2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:29.080]  Denmark, Sweden, and Norway have completely reopened and are ready to accept life with
[2:01:29.080 --> 2:01:34.160]  this novel asymptomatic virus with a 99% survival rate.
[2:01:34.160 --> 2:01:43.240]  And Japan is moving on as well, but not Australia, not the UK, not Canada, and certainly not
[2:01:43.240 --> 2:01:50.160]  the USA, where today's global currency is being printed by the privately owned Federal
[2:01:50.160 --> 2:01:55.200]  Reserve Banking System, the spearhead of this great reset.
[2:01:55.200 --> 2:02:01.240]  Only nations with vibrant free markets and cultures that still value independent freedoms
[2:02:01.240 --> 2:02:06.360]  are being targeted by the globalist elite, who instruct their loyal minions to push
[2:02:06.360 --> 2:02:12.880]  endless deadly experimental injections and denounce any and all life saving solutions,
[2:02:12.880 --> 2:02:19.560]  such as ivermectin, vitamin C, and even natural immunity.
[2:02:19.560 --> 2:02:24.320]  They want death because they want to mandate a vaccine.
[2:02:24.320 --> 2:02:30.120]  They want to mandate a vaccine because they want a social credit score.
[2:02:30.120 --> 2:02:34.760]  And they want a social credit score because they are planning on resetting the global
[2:02:34.760 --> 2:02:38.360]  currency to the digital blockchain.
[2:02:38.360 --> 2:02:44.360]  What millions of people in these western nations under attack would call the mark of the beast,
[2:02:44.360 --> 2:02:50.880]  known today as the Chinese social credit system, wherein each citizen is completely reliant
[2:02:50.880 --> 2:02:53.320]  upon the government.
[2:02:53.320 --> 2:02:54.800]  Absolute tyranny.
[2:02:54.800 --> 2:03:01.200]  There is no global pandemic, and the only virus that threatens humanity is the big banks,
[2:03:01.200 --> 2:03:05.720]  their offshoots, and whomever or whatever they serve.
[2:03:05.720 --> 2:03:12.440]  This is quite simply the parasitic top of the global pyramid, feeding off all of humanity.
[2:03:12.440 --> 2:03:17.640]  A former Vatican Bank president has recently warned that the Covid pandemic is nothing
[2:03:17.640 --> 2:03:21.200]  but a fraud to bring in the great reset.
[2:03:21.200 --> 2:03:27.200]  We reported that this was the case back in March of 2020, because it's happened before.
[2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:31.960]  And now, unless we stop them, it's going to happen again.
[2:03:31.960 --> 2:03:39.000]  Biden's nominee for Comptroller of the Currency, Sally Omarova, is a proud communist who wants
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:41.600]  to end banking as we know it.
[2:03:41.600 --> 2:03:47.600]  The worldwide banking cartel, who gets rich off the fractional reserve banking scam and
[2:03:47.600 --> 2:03:53.440]  by charging interest on loaning people their own resources, has no problem exterminating
[2:03:53.440 --> 2:03:57.040]  anyone opposed to their great reset agenda.
[2:03:57.040 --> 2:04:02.200]  To the big banks, we are all livestock, chattel.
[2:04:02.200 --> 2:04:06.360]  This is greed on its most realized level.
[2:04:06.360 --> 2:04:12.200]  They are passing laws to restrict travel and to seize private property.
[2:04:12.200 --> 2:04:18.680]  Police and military not willing to go along are being forced out via vaccine mandates.
[2:04:18.680 --> 2:04:23.480]  And nurses not going along are being replaced by the military.
[2:04:23.480 --> 2:04:26.320]  The system has already been hijacked.
[2:04:26.320 --> 2:04:28.600]  No one is coming to save you.
[2:04:28.600 --> 2:04:34.120]  The only way out of this mess without losing everything that's worth fighting for is for
[2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:38.920]  humanity to stand up and say no.
[2:04:38.920 --> 2:04:58.680]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[2:04:58.680 --> 2:05:02.960]  And in addition, we were really finding that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary systems
[2:05:02.960 --> 2:05:07.240]  of these employees because when you cover the mouth and nose and you exert physical
[2:05:07.240 --> 2:05:12.280]  energy during your work, during your tasks, whatever it might be, you're really stressing
[2:05:12.280 --> 2:05:15.360]  the cardiopulmonary system because you change the way that you breathe.
[2:05:15.360 --> 2:05:18.720]  You have to forcibly inhale and forcibly exhale.
[2:05:18.720 --> 2:05:20.240]  That taxes the heart.
[2:05:20.240 --> 2:05:21.680]  It taxes the lungs.
[2:05:21.680 --> 2:05:26.200]  And we have given people heart attacks by allowing them to work with their mouth and
[2:05:26.200 --> 2:05:33.000]  nose covered with absolutely no regulation, no oversight, no medical oversight.
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:35.200]  The globalists have told us we're a disease.
[2:05:35.200 --> 2:05:37.120]  They've told us they want to eradicate us.
[2:05:37.120 --> 2:05:41.000]  And all the studies show that when you wear these masks, it lowers your oxygen level up
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:46.080]  to one third and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide poisoning.
[2:05:46.080 --> 2:05:48.720]  This is a sick cult and we've got to say no.
[2:05:48.720 --> 2:05:52.880]  But the only way the real science can sound to the public is if we tell them, get your
[2:05:52.880 --> 2:05:55.880]  copy today of COVIDLand and expose them.
[2:05:55.880 --> 2:05:57.120]  It's COVIDLand.com.
[2:05:57.120 --> 2:06:02.120]  Go there now.
[2:06:02.120 --> 2:06:04.720]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:06:04.720 --> 2:06:12.720]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[2:06:12.720 --> 2:06:26.720]  General's gathered in their masses, just like witches at black masses.
[2:06:26.720 --> 2:06:35.640]  All right, we've got some major breaking, really good news.
[2:06:35.640 --> 2:06:39.840]  And then we've got some expected bad news for you and then right back to your calls.
[2:06:39.840 --> 2:06:40.840]  Wow.
[2:06:40.840 --> 2:06:41.840]  Here we go.
[2:06:41.840 --> 2:06:46.720]  Sweden halts use of Moderna's COVID vaccine.
[2:06:46.720 --> 2:06:53.280]  Sweden halts use of Moderna's COVID vaccine, Moderna's DARPA and Bill Gates.
[2:06:53.280 --> 2:06:57.240]  For younger adults, there have been concerns over rare heart inflammation, side effects
[2:06:57.240 --> 2:06:58.960]  that's no longer rare.
[2:06:58.960 --> 2:06:59.960]  That's RT.
[2:06:59.960 --> 2:07:09.400]  There's one out of Yahoo News, Sweden halts use of Moderna's COVID vaccine in under 30s.
[2:07:09.400 --> 2:07:13.840]  And the Pfizer's doing the same damn thing, but Moderna's even worse for the heart, it's
[2:07:13.840 --> 2:07:14.840]  even stronger.
[2:07:14.840 --> 2:07:21.000]  This great NIH director, Francis Collins, to resign for Wuhan lab lies exposed that he
[2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:23.840]  needed gain of function and was involved creating the virus.
[2:07:23.840 --> 2:07:30.280]  That's mainstream news breaking all over the place while he resigned, incredible.
[2:07:30.280 --> 2:07:34.880]  And then I've got some other shocking news.
[2:07:34.880 --> 2:07:41.080]  Conflict of interest, AG Garland's family sells critical race theory material to schools
[2:07:41.080 --> 2:07:46.720]  across the nation as AG Six FBI on critics.
[2:07:46.720 --> 2:07:53.840]  You know, they pay these bottom feeders like the attorney general and even these senators,
[2:07:53.840 --> 2:07:57.000]  hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, they buy them for nothing.
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:01.360]  Remember Trump used to say, I know all these people, I've given hundreds of thousands each
[2:08:01.360 --> 2:08:02.360]  one of them over the years.
[2:08:02.360 --> 2:08:07.080]  Hell, you buy them cheap, like that senator I bought for $5,000 because I'm not for it.
[2:08:07.080 --> 2:08:08.080]  It's how the system works.
[2:08:08.080 --> 2:08:09.080]  It's legal bribery.
[2:08:09.080 --> 2:08:10.920]  If you don't pay them all money, they come after you.
[2:08:10.920 --> 2:08:15.760]  You pay them money, they will kiss the ring and pull up the clips of him saying, so he
[2:08:15.760 --> 2:08:18.360]  said, hey, I want to make my ties here in America.
[2:08:18.360 --> 2:08:21.560]  They cost like $200 to make one here a silk tie.
[2:08:21.560 --> 2:08:22.560]  That's this nice.
[2:08:22.560 --> 2:08:23.560]  I can make them for $30 in China.
[2:08:23.560 --> 2:08:28.080]  And I still got a salty for $200 to make my money off the taxes, the regulations, the
[2:08:28.080 --> 2:08:30.320]  unions, the, I love that clip.
[2:08:30.320 --> 2:08:37.360]  I'll see if you can find them and go to calls later from what's the Rodney Dangerfield movie
[2:08:37.360 --> 2:08:44.160]  back to school where he's in the professor's class on economics has never run a business.
[2:08:44.160 --> 2:08:49.920]  He's like, let's have our fictional building here with a lot and the cement and the, and
[2:08:49.920 --> 2:08:54.320]  the stone and the building and the wood and the windows and the plumbing and the, and
[2:08:54.320 --> 2:08:56.680]  the electrical and then they were ready to open our building.
[2:08:56.680 --> 2:09:00.440]  And he goes, well, you haven't thought about all the politicians you got to buy and all
[2:09:00.440 --> 2:09:02.520]  the these people you got to grease.
[2:09:02.520 --> 2:09:04.720]  He goes, come down, be quiet.
[2:09:04.720 --> 2:09:07.520]  Let's talk about where we're going to build our building.
[2:09:07.520 --> 2:09:10.720]  And he goes, how about fantasy land?
[2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:12.800]  I'm sorry.
[2:09:12.800 --> 2:09:14.980]  It's just, it's just, it's ridiculous.
[2:09:14.980 --> 2:09:17.000]  They buy these people off for nothing.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:21.400]  Well, the bankers control trillions, but it's all just made up money.
[2:09:21.400 --> 2:09:22.400]  They can use its weaponized.
[2:09:22.400 --> 2:09:23.400]  Yeah.
[2:09:23.400 --> 2:09:24.400]  Here it is.
[2:09:24.400 --> 2:09:25.400]  So do you guys have it ready?
[2:09:25.400 --> 2:09:26.400]  I'll go ahead and play it.
[2:09:26.400 --> 2:09:27.400]  Not yet.
[2:09:27.400 --> 2:09:28.400]  Okay.
[2:09:28.400 --> 2:09:29.400]  They're downloading it.
[2:09:29.400 --> 2:09:31.640]  It's hilarious.
[2:09:31.640 --> 2:09:33.920]  So let me go ahead and hit this news.
[2:09:33.920 --> 2:09:34.920]  Remember Kamala Harris.
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:35.920]  They all do this.
[2:09:35.920 --> 2:09:42.120]  They bought tens of thousands of her books to give them to the migrant children.
[2:09:42.120 --> 2:09:46.240]  A lot of them kidnapped kids being brought across from the UN collapsing their own countries
[2:09:46.240 --> 2:09:49.200]  and now they're flooding into us organized by the UN.
[2:09:49.200 --> 2:09:53.080]  And they were giving them that book written by her, a children's book.
[2:09:53.080 --> 2:09:56.280]  I mean, it's just direct criminal activity.
[2:09:56.280 --> 2:10:02.640]  So just days after Attorney General Merrick Garland ordered the FBI to investigate parents
[2:10:02.640 --> 2:10:07.320]  speaking out against critical race theory, a journalist pointed out that Garland's family
[2:10:07.320 --> 2:10:10.400]  sells CRT materials to public schools.
[2:10:10.400 --> 2:10:14.480]  Attorney Merrick's daughter is married to the co-founder of an education service company
[2:10:14.480 --> 2:10:18.240]  that pushes the material.
[2:10:18.240 --> 2:10:22.160]  The conservative treehouse reports and it goes on to all the detail, the books or whites
[2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:24.000]  again are devils and evil have to be dealt with.
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:27.720]  So of course he's going to sick the FBI on folks that don't want to have their kids told
[2:10:27.720 --> 2:10:31.400]  that they're evil because they're white because it's a race-based cult of evil.
[2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:35.160]  A bunch of old, evil white people try to manipulate brown people and white people to all kill
[2:10:35.160 --> 2:10:37.360]  each other while they run off and rob us.
[2:10:37.360 --> 2:10:38.360]  All right.
[2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:39.920]  Let's go back to your calls here.
[2:10:39.920 --> 2:10:42.240]  Who's been holding the longest?
[2:10:42.240 --> 2:10:45.240]  That would be Dun Dun Dun Dun.
[2:10:45.240 --> 2:10:46.240]  Bob in New York.
[2:10:46.240 --> 2:10:47.240]  Bob, thanks for holding.
[2:10:47.240 --> 2:10:48.240]  Go ahead.
[2:10:48.240 --> 2:10:49.240]  Hey, Alex.
[2:10:49.240 --> 2:10:50.240]  Man, I love you, man.
[2:10:50.240 --> 2:10:51.720]  It's been a long time since we spoke.
[2:10:51.720 --> 2:10:52.720]  Welcome, sir.
[2:10:52.720 --> 2:10:53.720]  Thanks.
[2:10:53.720 --> 2:10:54.720]  Thank you.
[2:10:54.720 --> 2:10:59.680]  Listen, I was thinking as you were chatting before that we marched across the Brooklyn
[2:10:59.680 --> 2:11:00.680]  Bridge one time.
[2:11:00.680 --> 2:11:03.240]  You and I were in 9-Eleven Truths in 2007.
[2:11:03.240 --> 2:11:04.640]  I remember that.
[2:11:04.640 --> 2:11:05.640]  I love that.
[2:11:05.640 --> 2:11:06.640]  Thousands of people.
[2:11:06.640 --> 2:11:07.640]  It was amazing.
[2:11:07.640 --> 2:11:08.640]  Oh, yeah, it was.
[2:11:08.640 --> 2:11:14.200]  Thousands of people and then it's dwindled and it is what it is, but we're still out
[2:11:14.200 --> 2:11:19.160]  there doing fighting the same sort of thing now, or genocide, basically, with these shots.
[2:11:19.160 --> 2:11:20.160]  Absolutely.
[2:11:20.160 --> 2:11:21.160]  Yeah, we were against those illegal wars.
[2:11:21.160 --> 2:11:22.160]  Today, we weren't against the military.
[2:11:22.160 --> 2:11:23.160]  The police.
[2:11:23.160 --> 2:11:24.160]  We were against the globalists.
[2:11:24.160 --> 2:11:27.280]  They thought I was a liberal back then.
[2:11:27.280 --> 2:11:28.280]  I wasn't a liberal.
[2:11:28.280 --> 2:11:31.360]  I'm just, I follow whatever the main justice issue is.
[2:11:31.360 --> 2:11:32.360]  My job's easy.
[2:11:32.360 --> 2:11:33.360]  Yeah.
[2:11:33.360 --> 2:11:34.360]  Yeah, you guys, you should come back.
[2:11:34.360 --> 2:11:36.360]  We're having, it's growing in New York anyway.
[2:11:36.360 --> 2:11:40.840]  I want to come protest those businesses they're still trying to lock down if they won't make
[2:11:40.840 --> 2:11:41.840]  people have shots.
[2:11:41.840 --> 2:11:42.840]  Absolutely.
[2:11:42.840 --> 2:11:44.840]  Oh, we have a, there's a small group.
[2:11:44.840 --> 2:11:48.360]  I mean, there's so many little groups that are doing their own thing.
[2:11:48.360 --> 2:11:53.400]  One of them is our friends and my name, we're all friends now, it's become 502,000 new friends
[2:11:53.400 --> 2:11:54.400]  of mine.
[2:11:54.400 --> 2:11:59.320]  And on Friday nights, we've been doing sit-ins in different restaurants that won't serve
[2:11:59.320 --> 2:12:00.320]  us so and so.
[2:12:00.320 --> 2:12:05.320]  Well, let me tell you, I've promised to come protest at the Australian Embassy and they've
[2:12:05.320 --> 2:12:07.200]  got one in New York and one in DC.
[2:12:07.200 --> 2:12:10.760]  And I don't like DC, I actually like the city of New York to spot all its issues.
[2:12:10.760 --> 2:12:13.120]  It's got a great feel in many areas.
[2:12:13.120 --> 2:12:15.160]  I like it compared to LA, I'll say that.
[2:12:15.160 --> 2:12:19.400]  I want to come, I want to protest the UN, I want to protest, that's just running it.
[2:12:19.400 --> 2:12:22.040]  And I want to protest at the Australian Embassy.
[2:12:22.040 --> 2:12:24.400]  So yes, sir, there's a good chance, I'm not a good chance.
[2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:29.920]  I will be to New York this year to join you guys to go do some protest and some sit-ins
[2:12:29.920 --> 2:12:34.280]  at these restaurants that won't let the uninjected in, like Bolsonaro wouldn't let him in.
[2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:35.760]  So God bless you and thanks for the call.
[2:12:35.760 --> 2:12:38.520]  All right, we're going to go to break, come back with more calls and then Robert Barnes
[2:12:38.520 --> 2:12:39.520]  is in next hour.
[2:12:39.520 --> 2:12:40.520]  So stay with us, callers.
[2:12:40.520 --> 2:12:41.520]  Can't wait to talk to you.
[2:12:41.520 --> 2:12:42.520]  You're awesome.
[2:12:42.520 --> 2:12:45.160]  But they found the clip from the movie.
[2:12:45.160 --> 2:12:47.160]  Is it back to school?
[2:12:47.160 --> 2:12:52.760]  Okay, back to school where Rodney Dangerfield at least explains how the East Coast and
[2:12:52.760 --> 2:12:53.760]  other areas work.
[2:12:53.760 --> 2:12:56.760]  Not so much in the South and the West, but it's becoming that way with corruption as
[2:12:56.760 --> 2:12:57.760]  well.
[2:12:57.760 --> 2:12:58.760]  Here it is.
[2:12:58.760 --> 2:13:08.360]  We've got downed people, we've got a lot to cover and time is short.
[2:13:08.360 --> 2:13:13.560]  There are two kinds of people in business today, the quick and the dead.
[2:13:13.560 --> 2:13:17.920]  So rather than waste your time this semester with a lot of useless theories, we're going
[2:13:17.920 --> 2:13:23.520]  to jump right in with both feet and create a fictional company from the ground up.
[2:13:23.520 --> 2:13:26.680]  We'll construct our physical plant.
[2:13:26.680 --> 2:13:30.480]  We'll set up an efficient administrative and executive structure.
[2:13:30.480 --> 2:13:33.960]  Then we'll manufacture our product and market it.
[2:13:33.960 --> 2:13:36.960]  I think you'll find it very interesting and a lot of fun.
[2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:42.440]  So let's start by looking at construction costs of our new factory.
[2:13:42.440 --> 2:13:45.040]  What's the product?
[2:13:45.040 --> 2:13:48.160]  That is immaterial for the purposes of our discussion here.
[2:13:48.160 --> 2:13:52.360]  But if it makes you happy, let's say we're making tape recorders.
[2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:57.080]  Are you kidding? The Japs will kill us on a labor course.
[2:13:57.080 --> 2:13:59.640]  Okay, fine.
[2:13:59.640 --> 2:14:03.400]  Then let's just say they're widgets.
[2:14:03.400 --> 2:14:04.480]  What's a widget?
[2:14:04.480 --> 2:14:06.160]  It's a fictional product.
[2:14:06.160 --> 2:14:07.160]  It doesn't matter.
[2:14:07.160 --> 2:14:08.160]  Doesn't matter.
[2:14:08.160 --> 2:14:09.160]  Tell her to the bank.
[2:14:09.160 --> 2:14:10.160]  Easy, take it easy.
[2:14:10.160 --> 2:14:12.960]  It's the first day, you know.
[2:14:12.960 --> 2:14:17.920]  On the board, you will see a cost analysis for construction of a 30,000 square foot facility
[2:14:17.920 --> 2:14:23.640]  which will encompass both factory and office space and is fully serviced by all utilities,
[2:14:23.640 --> 2:14:26.920]  a railroad spur line, and a four bay shipping dock.
[2:14:26.920 --> 2:14:29.240]  Hold on, hold on. Why Bill?
[2:14:29.240 --> 2:14:32.800]  You better off leasing a buck and a quarter buck and a half a square foot.
[2:14:32.800 --> 2:14:35.080]  Take it down payment and put it into CDs.
[2:14:35.080 --> 2:14:37.520]  Or something else you can roll over every couple of months.
[2:14:37.520 --> 2:14:40.080]  Thank you, Mr. Mellon.
[2:14:40.080 --> 2:14:44.400]  But we'll be concentrating on finance a little later in the term.
[2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:49.520]  For the time being, let's just concentrate on the construction figures, shall we?
[2:14:49.520 --> 2:14:53.360]  You will see the final bottom line requires the factoring in of not just the material
[2:14:53.360 --> 2:14:59.680]  and construction costs, but also the architect's fees and the costs of land servicing.
[2:14:59.680 --> 2:15:02.400]  Oh, you left out a bunch of stuff.
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:04.600]  Oh, really?
[2:15:04.600 --> 2:15:06.480]  Like what, for instance?
[2:15:06.480 --> 2:15:10.480]  Well, first of all, you're going to have to grease local politicians for the sudden zoning
[2:15:10.480 --> 2:15:12.040]  problems that always come up.
[2:15:12.040 --> 2:15:14.120]  That is, the kickbacks to the carpenters.
[2:15:14.120 --> 2:15:16.400]  And if you plan on using any cement in this building,
[2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:18.600]  I'm sure the teams would like to have a little chat with you.
[2:15:18.600 --> 2:15:19.960]  And that'll cost you.
[2:15:19.960 --> 2:15:22.720]  Oh, and don't forget something for the building inspectors.
[2:15:22.720 --> 2:15:25.680]  Then there's a long term cost, such as waste disposal.
[2:15:25.680 --> 2:15:27.840]  I don't know if you're familiar with who runs that business,
[2:15:27.840 --> 2:15:30.120]  but I assure you it's not the Boy Scouts.
[2:15:30.120 --> 2:15:31.840]  That'll be quite enough, Mr. Mellon.
[2:15:31.840 --> 2:15:36.880]  Maybe bribes and kickbacks and mafia payoffs are how you do business.
[2:15:36.880 --> 2:15:40.160]  But they are not part of the legitimate business world.
[2:15:40.160 --> 2:15:42.800]  And they're certainly not part of anything I am teaching in this class.
[2:15:42.800 --> 2:15:44.520]  Do I make myself clear?
[2:15:44.520 --> 2:15:47.360]  Sorry, just trying to help, that's all.
[2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:51.880]  Now, notwithstanding Mr. Mellon's input,
[2:15:51.880 --> 2:15:57.400]  the next question for us is, where to build our factory?
[2:15:57.400 --> 2:16:01.400]  Hey, everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[2:16:01.400 --> 2:16:02.200]  Me too.
[2:16:02.200 --> 2:16:05.480]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies,
[2:16:05.480 --> 2:16:09.280]  after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[2:16:09.280 --> 2:16:12.360]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference
[2:16:12.360 --> 2:16:13.760]  between life and death.
[2:16:13.760 --> 2:16:15.600]  You probably already believe that.
[2:16:15.600 --> 2:16:16.640]  I certainly do.
[2:16:16.640 --> 2:16:19.200]  So here's the thing, I wanted to get past the craziness
[2:16:19.200 --> 2:16:22.920]  and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies
[2:16:22.920 --> 2:16:26.480]  that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[2:16:26.480 --> 2:16:28.080]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver,
[2:16:28.080 --> 2:16:31.920]  but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefense.com.
[2:16:31.920 --> 2:16:33.240]  No cures or treatments there.
[2:16:33.240 --> 2:16:37.080]  Instead, little-known but shocking immune system research
[2:16:37.080 --> 2:16:40.520]  and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research
[2:16:40.520 --> 2:16:42.480]  called Immune 10x.
[2:16:42.480 --> 2:16:45.640]  In the best part, you can go to the Stronger Defense website right now
[2:16:45.640 --> 2:16:50.080]  and claim your own supply of Immune 10x without paying anything today.

[2:17:05.680 --> 2:17:07.040]  it changes the world.
[2:17:07.040 --> 2:17:09.640]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:17:09.640 --> 2:17:11.120]  They know you're angry.
[2:17:11.120 --> 2:17:13.960]  And now, to get around big tech, it's more important than ever
[2:17:13.960 --> 2:17:16.560]  that we use every tool we've got.

[2:17:58.240 --> 2:18:02.080]  Back in stock, down and out, liquid sleep support.
[2:18:02.080 --> 2:18:03.480]  It's been out of stock for a while.
[2:18:03.480 --> 2:18:07.240]  It's one of three sleep aids we have at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:18:07.240 --> 2:18:08.480]  This one has been very popular.
[2:18:08.480 --> 2:18:09.640]  It's sold off the shelves.
[2:18:09.640 --> 2:18:13.520]  It's back in stock, down and out, liquid sleep support.
[2:18:13.520 --> 2:18:19.320]  This is probably the strongest sleep aid that we have, I would say.
[2:18:19.320 --> 2:18:22.240]  Knockout, rocket rest, both great.
[2:18:22.240 --> 2:18:23.680]  Comes in pill form.
[2:18:23.680 --> 2:18:27.680]  This is the liquid tincture, and I think this is probably the most powerful one.
[2:18:27.680 --> 2:18:29.680]  Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine.
[2:18:29.680 --> 2:18:32.480]  This is, if you haven't done an iodine challenge yet,
[2:18:32.480 --> 2:18:36.560]  if you haven't done the iodine challenge, what are you waiting for now is the time.
[2:18:36.560 --> 2:18:39.120]  Super male and super female vitality.
[2:18:39.120 --> 2:18:43.240]  Living Defense Plus and the Organic Greens Fiber Caps.
[2:18:43.240 --> 2:18:47.200]  We have a limited supply of these right now, but we want to sell them all out
[2:18:47.200 --> 2:18:48.200]  so we can order a new batch.
[2:18:48.200 --> 2:18:50.960]  It was very popular, the Organic Greens Fiber Caps.
[2:18:50.960 --> 2:18:55.600]  But we have all kinds of other great supplements that are great for so many different things.
[2:18:55.600 --> 2:18:57.920]  Take advantage of those.
[2:18:58.800 --> 2:19:04.080]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience.
[2:19:04.080 --> 2:19:10.240]  A symbol of slavery. A symbol of the chains that the medical tyranny combined,
[2:19:10.240 --> 2:19:14.120]  controlled by the global private corporations, has put in place.
[2:19:14.120 --> 2:19:19.960]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[2:19:19.960 --> 2:19:22.880]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad,
[2:19:22.880 --> 2:19:28.120]  and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun.
[2:19:28.120 --> 2:19:35.720]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[2:19:35.720 --> 2:19:40.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[2:19:40.320 --> 2:19:43.600]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[2:19:43.600 --> 2:19:46.960]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips
[2:19:46.960 --> 2:19:49.920]  as part of the World ID and Carbon Taxes.
[2:19:49.920 --> 2:19:52.200]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[2:19:52.200 --> 2:19:55.560]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[2:19:55.560 --> 2:19:58.280]  Non-compliance, non-compliance, non-compliance.
[2:20:01.160 --> 2:20:04.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:20:18.760 --> 2:20:22.080]  Welcome back to the show that should not be.
[2:20:22.080 --> 2:20:26.240]  The nameless one, the name that must not be said, Wired Magazine said four years ago
[2:20:26.240 --> 2:20:31.440]  with R.D. Platforming, but I knew it was going to be an attack on everybody.
[2:20:31.440 --> 2:20:34.960]  I knew it was coming because I'd read the global swine papers that are public.
[2:20:34.960 --> 2:20:38.960]  It'll be their arrogance that is there undoing.
[2:20:38.960 --> 2:20:41.840]  Already so many have resigned from the federal government for running
[2:20:41.840 --> 2:20:46.520]  the Wuhan lab bio-weapon attack. Now only Fauci stands.
[2:20:46.520 --> 2:20:49.160]  How long until he has to resign?
[2:20:49.160 --> 2:20:51.640]  How long until in the court of public opinion he's so hated
[2:20:51.640 --> 2:20:59.200]  and so hunted by the crimes he's committed and haunted that he is indicted?
[2:20:59.200 --> 2:21:03.800]  How long can the Justice Department be run by the criminals that are in control of it?
[2:21:05.800 --> 2:21:10.120]  Explosive video emerges of Fauci and HHS officials plotting
[2:21:10.120 --> 2:21:14.400]  for a new avian flu virus to enforce universal flu vaccination.
[2:21:14.400 --> 2:21:17.560]  I saw this information Monday.
[2:21:17.560 --> 2:21:20.040]  It was already six at night and I said we got to get this together
[2:21:20.040 --> 2:21:23.640]  to report on it because it was so out of control, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:21:23.640 --> 2:21:26.200]  And it's only got a million views. That sounds like a lot. It's not.
[2:21:26.200 --> 2:21:29.400]  Yeah, that's 10 sports stadiums full of 100,000 people a piece
[2:21:29.400 --> 2:21:33.080]  and then a high school football game of 23,000 on the side.
[2:21:33.080 --> 2:21:37.400]  It needs to be 10 million views. Get it?
[2:21:37.400 --> 2:21:40.920]  Send it on your email. Send it on your text message.
[2:21:40.920 --> 2:21:44.360]  If you want these criminals to pay, we're not going to kill them.
[2:21:44.360 --> 2:21:47.160]  That'll turn them into martyrs. That's the only way they can win.
[2:21:47.160 --> 2:21:51.000]  Globals are probably going to false flag themselves soon. I already said that's in the cards.
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:21:53.560]  Obviously, you know that, too. You don't want me to tell you.
[2:21:53.560 --> 2:21:58.200]  But we want to politically annihilate them and expose them for what they've done.
[2:21:58.200 --> 2:22:01.560]  They think threatening and intimidating and they think threatening to kill me.
[2:22:01.560 --> 2:22:03.320]  They think threatening to come from my family.
[2:22:03.320 --> 2:22:07.080]  They think saying all these other things they've done to us are going to stop us.
[2:22:07.080 --> 2:22:11.560]  You see what's going on here? The opposite.
[2:22:12.760 --> 2:22:15.320]  For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[2:22:15.320 --> 2:22:17.720]  Newtonian physics, third dimension, God law.
[2:22:20.600 --> 2:22:23.000]  And if you're prepared to fight evil,
[2:22:25.560 --> 2:22:28.680]  God's got his hand on your shoulder. You're going to do incredible things.
[2:22:28.680 --> 2:22:30.680]  And those of you tuned in are here for a reason.
[2:22:30.680 --> 2:22:35.400]  You've got God watching you and God's hands on your shoulder right now.
[2:22:36.440 --> 2:22:39.400]  All right, let's go to the calls. Who's been holding the longest?
[2:22:39.400 --> 2:22:41.160]  Again, I'm going to go on the order these are received.
[2:22:41.160 --> 2:22:46.920]  And that would be Riley in North Carolina. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[2:22:48.040 --> 2:22:50.440]  Hey there, Alex. Just wanted to say I'm a first-time caller.
[2:22:50.440 --> 2:22:52.600]  I'm praying for you and your family and your crew.
[2:22:52.600 --> 2:22:57.160]  Thank you. You inspire me daily, you know, fighting against these false accusations.
[2:22:57.160 --> 2:23:00.680]  We all know as Christians who the great accuser is. So thank you for all you do.
[2:23:01.800 --> 2:23:02.120]  Thank you.
[2:23:02.120 --> 2:23:08.200]  I wanted to jump in regarding last week's article with the New York Times talking about
[2:23:08.200 --> 2:23:11.800]  the redesigning of the American flag. And I don't know if you've already covered this or not.
[2:23:12.600 --> 2:23:15.880]  I barely mentioned it. You know, they got a trillion-dollar coin they've got.
[2:23:15.880 --> 2:23:19.000]  Yes, they're saying America's evil. So we've got to rewrite it.
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  Yes. I tell folks about it. We'll show it on screen.
[2:23:22.200 --> 2:23:26.360]  Yeah. So I briefly read the article. I'm not described to the New York Times.
[2:23:26.360 --> 2:23:29.480]  I went to another website and it's due to Fox News, unfortunately.
[2:23:29.480 --> 2:23:35.560]  But basically, there's these designers. Some are U.S. based and some are from like
[2:23:35.560 --> 2:23:41.960]  South Korea, Berlin, Denmark saying that the flag needs to be redesigned because the loss
[2:23:41.960 --> 2:23:46.760]  of America's values are imminent and the power of America has fallen.
[2:23:46.760 --> 2:23:49.560]  Therefore, we need to redesign the American flag.
[2:23:49.560 --> 2:23:55.320]  And to me, that convinces the normies in this country, per se,
[2:23:55.320 --> 2:23:59.000]  to hopefully realize that we are, in fact, in an ideological war.
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:01.880]  Absolutely. No borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[2:24:01.880 --> 2:24:05.960]  Everything is how the founding documents are bad and it's evil because once you get rid of that,
[2:24:06.520 --> 2:24:10.360]  you're under globalist law, which is no law at all. Under the UN, you have no rights.
[2:24:10.360 --> 2:24:14.440]  Oh, they have all these rights and they're universal Declaration of Human Rights, 30 articles.
[2:24:14.440 --> 2:24:19.000]  But in the last two articles, they say you have no rights under the UN or stakeholders.
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:24.200]  And Klaus Schwab that ran the whole UN eugenics operation and their sustainability project says
[2:24:24.200 --> 2:24:28.520]  only the UN and corporations should have power. We are capturing your governments now.
[2:24:28.520 --> 2:24:32.760]  That's on this Wikipedia. Yep. So thank you so much for all you do, Alex.
[2:24:32.760 --> 2:24:38.200]  I also just want to give a quick plug for bodies. I took that about a week or two prior to
[2:24:38.920 --> 2:24:42.360]  I was trying to jump off of a tree into a river for fun, you know, and actually
[2:24:42.360 --> 2:24:47.320]  slipped and fell on a rock and was healed in like a week. And I'm firmly convinced or
[2:24:47.880 --> 2:24:51.480]  I'm convinced that it was because of bodies, whatever's in that, the turmeric, everything
[2:24:51.480 --> 2:24:55.640]  in there really helped me heal. And I just thank you for all you do. Your supplements are awesome.
[2:24:55.640 --> 2:25:01.880]  I love the stickers and can't wait to watch in game. Absolutely. And I should plug this
[2:25:01.880 --> 2:25:05.640]  since you're saying it tomorrow night, it's going to be free for everybody band.video,
[2:25:05.640 --> 2:25:08.840]  freeworldnews.tv. So you want to promote that it's going to be live tomorrow.
[2:25:08.840 --> 2:25:13.000]  You can't promote band.video on Twitter or other places. You have to quote and promote
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:19.800]  freeworldnews.tv 7 p.m. tomorrow night. I'm going to have the producer and the
[2:25:20.920 --> 2:25:25.480]  director on. I've been a producer as well, but the real producer that financed it.
[2:25:25.480 --> 2:25:29.960]  The producer who's very well spoken and the director who's amazing on. It's a first rate film,
[2:25:29.960 --> 2:25:35.240]  multimillion dollar budget, almost 50 top experts interviewed like Robert Kennedy Jr.
[2:25:35.240 --> 2:25:41.160]  10 penny. The list goes on and on. Dale Big Tree. We're very, very, very, very proud of the film.
[2:25:41.160 --> 2:25:45.160]  It'll premiere for everybody free and everybody that ordered it. It's begun shipping out today
[2:25:45.160 --> 2:25:49.560]  on DVD. We always said we're going to air it for free, but people want to support the filmmakers
[2:25:49.560 --> 2:25:54.520]  because the director and the crew have not been paid in the last year making this. And this is
[2:25:54.520 --> 2:25:59.880]  only part one. They've got four other parts coming out that really expose the whole great reset
[2:25:59.880 --> 2:26:04.920]  and the rest of it. So thank you so much. That's going to air tomorrow. 7 p.m. Central 8 p.m. Eastern
[2:26:04.920 --> 2:26:12.360]  6 p.m. Mountain 5 p.m. Pacific at band.video and freeworldnews.tv. There'll be a big central
[2:26:12.360 --> 2:26:18.680]  video featured video and you'll find the feed on info wars.com. So thank you so much. There's only
[2:26:18.680 --> 2:26:24.120]  a few days left for everybody to get a free copy of in game blueprint for global enslavement
[2:26:24.120 --> 2:26:29.960]  when you get a copy of that film. And again, this is all about information and the funding to be able
[2:26:29.960 --> 2:26:34.120]  to get the information out. And so you're going to notice that used to I plugged once an hour
[2:26:34.680 --> 2:26:38.840]  and things like that. Now I'm doing it about twice an hour because we need funds to get around the
[2:26:38.840 --> 2:26:43.400]  deplatforming. We need funds to launch some major operations we've got. We're not telling the enemy
[2:26:43.400 --> 2:26:48.600]  about obviously yet. They're going to massively increase what we do. We're not just going to
[2:26:48.600 --> 2:26:53.320]  fight here and stay at one level. We're going all out because we're either going to get bigger
[2:26:53.320 --> 2:26:57.720]  and do more or we're going to be destroyed. I'm going to leave it at that. We're either going to
[2:26:57.720 --> 2:27:03.800]  expand or shut down because the level of attack we're under, you don't get smaller in the face.
[2:27:03.800 --> 2:27:08.840]  Big fish defeat other fish. Big fish eat little fish. They're trying to eat us. We're going to
[2:27:08.840 --> 2:27:15.080]  politically eat them. And believe me, I am a busy beaver. It's like an ant hive here and other
[2:27:15.080 --> 2:27:22.280]  places and we just have alliances and organizations and groups coming together now and doing amazing
[2:27:22.280 --> 2:27:29.720]  things. And so I liken it to contact where they blow up the one facility that's about to contact
[2:27:29.720 --> 2:27:34.840]  the aliens and get the advanced technology, the free energy or whatever. And it doesn't matter
[2:27:34.840 --> 2:27:39.480]  there. I got a whole other one built. And so that's what this is all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:27:39.480 --> 2:27:47.160]  So we need major capital to infowarstore.com. Plus we got products you need. So today is the last
[2:27:47.160 --> 2:27:52.280]  day I extended a few days to get t-shirts that cost like Alex Jones was right. Totally triggers the
[2:27:52.280 --> 2:27:55.160]  left. They can't stand. I think that ought to be the new t-shirt everybody gets. People are already
[2:27:55.160 --> 2:27:58.200]  getting asked, what's the best seller? They said, well, it's not the same, the frog shirt anymore.
[2:27:58.200 --> 2:28:01.880]  It's now this. And I said, great, we're going to promote that. We're going to keep selling it at
[2:28:01.880 --> 2:28:08.360]  cost. So when the other t shirts and things go back to the same regular already discounted price
[2:28:08.360 --> 2:28:16.360]  tomorrow, we're going to have Alex Jones was right shirt is going to be sold at cost at infowarstore.com.
[2:28:16.360 --> 2:28:20.040]  That's the big shirt I think everybody should get, but it's up to you. And again, I just go off what
[2:28:20.040 --> 2:28:24.360]  you think when it comes to products because you already like Alex Jones was right. That's already
[2:28:24.360 --> 2:28:29.880]  the best seller right in front of us. Save the frog shirt. So we'll have saved the frogs at cost too.
[2:28:29.880 --> 2:28:34.360]  Save the frogs at cost and Alex Jones was right. And the trigger the left of the big info wars.com
[2:28:34.360 --> 2:28:39.080]  the back. Hey, no more plugging. I'm done plugging. We're going to come back and go bam, bam, bam

[2:33:03.800 --> 2:33:26.120]  Big brother mainstream media government cover us. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he
[2:33:26.120 --> 2:33:36.600]  live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones. I've got an MPC. I'm a man and
[2:33:36.600 --> 2:33:41.480]  I've got a spirit and a soul and I'm alive and I interface with the beautiful universe
[2:33:41.480 --> 2:33:56.840]  God made and I worship God. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive.
[2:33:56.840 --> 2:34:18.360]  The big moments of truth are coming, evils making it smooth. Are you scared? Or are you alive?
[2:34:18.360 --> 2:34:24.880]  Because for every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[2:34:24.880 --> 2:34:26.880]  Choose your destiny now.
[2:34:26.880 --> 2:34:32.280]  All right, here we are, big news, and I'm going to hit it next hour, Robert Barth, but
[2:34:32.280 --> 2:34:34.840]  let me tell you what it is.
[2:34:34.840 --> 2:34:41.640]  Vaccinated Vermont, 75% of September COVID deaths were jabbed, and they've got internal
[2:34:41.640 --> 2:34:47.720]  documents now coming out that it's causing massive levels of death.
[2:34:47.720 --> 2:34:48.920]  My jaw dropped.
[2:34:48.920 --> 2:34:54.280]  Blood test before and after COVID jab proves shot, obliterates immune system, and that's
[2:34:54.280 --> 2:34:59.520]  what the Pentagon reports already say, but now they've got video and documents of it all.
[2:34:59.520 --> 2:35:00.840]  This is just unbelievable.
[2:35:00.840 --> 2:35:01.960]  They have attacked us.
[2:35:01.960 --> 2:35:04.360]  They have absolutely gone for broke.
[2:35:04.360 --> 2:35:09.160]  And in this video, ex-Biden border patrol chief claims 400,000 legals escaped in the
[2:35:09.160 --> 2:35:10.960]  U.S., 90% never deported.
[2:35:10.960 --> 2:35:13.080]  Hell, that's a very low number.
[2:35:13.080 --> 2:35:14.280]  That's just in one area, though.
[2:35:14.280 --> 2:35:15.400]  That's all coming up.
[2:35:15.400 --> 2:35:18.760]  Yeah, it's not 20,000, it's not 30,000.
[2:35:18.760 --> 2:35:19.760]  It's massive.
[2:35:19.760 --> 2:35:21.360]  Folks, we talked to war patrol whistleblowers.
[2:35:21.360 --> 2:35:23.400]  They said it's millions already.
[2:35:23.400 --> 2:35:28.040]  And we explained how they tell them, claimed that they were turnbacks.
[2:35:28.040 --> 2:35:31.160]  So they're saying 80% are turnbacks when they're almost none are turnbacks.
[2:35:31.160 --> 2:35:32.160]  They're just flooding across.
[2:35:32.160 --> 2:35:36.720]  So the real numbers are 7 to 10 million by fiscal year 2021.
[2:35:36.720 --> 2:35:37.720]  That's October 31st.
[2:35:37.720 --> 2:35:40.480]  So there's a real number.
[2:35:40.480 --> 2:35:43.800]  Just count on Fox and just water it down and give you some kind of, we're going to get
[2:35:43.800 --> 2:35:46.520]  it all coming up next hour, but my God, that's a joke.
[2:35:46.520 --> 2:35:48.960]  Hell, the official numbers are 2 million in Texas sector this year.
[2:35:48.960 --> 2:35:50.480]  That was like four months ago.
[2:35:50.480 --> 2:35:52.920]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[2:35:52.920 --> 2:35:53.920]  One hello, time to be alive.
[2:35:53.920 --> 2:35:55.720]  That's all I can tell you.
[2:35:55.720 --> 2:35:58.800]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in Pennsylvania.
[2:35:58.800 --> 2:35:59.800]  Welcome.
[2:35:59.800 --> 2:36:00.800]  Hello, Kevin.
[2:36:00.800 --> 2:36:01.800]  Welcome, sir.
[2:36:01.800 --> 2:36:02.800]  Wonderful to talk to you.
[2:36:02.800 --> 2:36:03.800]  All right.
[2:36:03.800 --> 2:36:04.800]  Kevin is gone.
[2:36:04.800 --> 2:36:09.520]  Let's go ahead and take another caller.
[2:36:09.520 --> 2:36:12.120]  Let's talk to Scott, Scott in Michigan.
[2:36:12.120 --> 2:36:15.360]  Go ahead, sir.
[2:36:15.360 --> 2:36:16.360]  Hi, Alex.
[2:36:16.360 --> 2:36:23.920]  I wanted to talk today about Janet Yellen, this demon from hell and what she and this
[2:36:23.920 --> 2:36:29.160]  new nominee for the controller of the currency are trying to do.
[2:36:29.160 --> 2:36:35.080]  These people are basically trying to tax this country, everybody in the middle class into
[2:36:35.080 --> 2:36:38.280]  complete just ridiculous.
[2:36:38.280 --> 2:36:43.800]  They want to take half your income and if they want to tax unrealized capital gains,
[2:36:43.800 --> 2:36:47.760]  which means that if you buy a house and your house goes up in value, they're going to make
[2:36:47.760 --> 2:36:48.760]  you sell it.
[2:36:48.760 --> 2:36:51.760]  They're going to make you sell it to pay the tax.
[2:36:51.760 --> 2:36:52.760]  Yeah.
[2:36:52.760 --> 2:36:53.760]  It's absolute enslavement.
[2:36:53.760 --> 2:36:54.760]  Yeah.
[2:36:54.760 --> 2:36:58.880]  No, I only have a couple minutes here, but I just wanted to remind everybody that everybody's
[2:36:58.880 --> 2:37:05.720]  focusing on forced vaccination and all that, but people have to focus on what is happening
[2:37:05.720 --> 2:37:10.200]  in the economy with all these Biden nominees, all these people.
[2:37:10.200 --> 2:37:12.360]  It's a really sad thing.
[2:37:12.360 --> 2:37:14.000]  So I would just encourage people to...
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  Well, sir, I'm not going to cut you off.
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  I want you to start over because what you're saying is the whole focus of the show today.
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:22.240]  When I began the broadcast, I played the Gregory's report and I said, the mega banks are bankrupting
[2:37:22.240 --> 2:37:23.240]  the world.
[2:37:23.240 --> 2:37:25.720]  They're getting rid of all the systems that allow people to own homes.
[2:37:25.720 --> 2:37:29.160]  They're going to bring in a universal income after a totally controlless.
[2:37:29.160 --> 2:37:36.280]  You are dead on of all the Federal Reserve caught insider trading, them waging war.
[2:37:36.280 --> 2:37:37.760]  Let's put it back on screen, please.
[2:37:37.760 --> 2:37:41.320]  Gregory's report is exactly what you're saying.
[2:37:41.320 --> 2:37:42.320]  We put that back on screen.
[2:37:42.320 --> 2:37:43.320]  Please.
[2:37:43.320 --> 2:37:44.320]  Thank you.
[2:37:44.320 --> 2:37:45.320]  And people need to share it.
[2:37:45.320 --> 2:37:48.200]  The big banks are guilty of crimes against humanity.
[2:37:48.200 --> 2:37:49.200]  Absolutely.
[2:37:49.200 --> 2:37:50.680]  Start over and explain what they're doing.
[2:37:50.680 --> 2:37:51.680]  Okay.
[2:37:51.680 --> 2:37:59.000]  So basically Janet Yellen, the former chairperson of the Federal Reserve and the current Secretary
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:03.200]  of the Treasury under Biden, wants to tax unrealized capital gains.
[2:38:03.200 --> 2:38:08.720]  So if you buy an asset, including a home, and that asset goes up in value, even if you
[2:38:08.720 --> 2:38:14.080]  don't have the money to pay for it, they want to tax you on that increase in value.
[2:38:14.080 --> 2:38:16.760]  So that completely eliminates homeownership.
[2:38:16.760 --> 2:38:22.880]  And her crony, Jay Powell, who was just caught basically buying the same assets that the Federal
[2:38:22.880 --> 2:38:23.880]  Reserve is buying.
[2:38:23.880 --> 2:38:29.640]  He says it's by coincidence, which you decide if you're going to believe that.
[2:38:29.640 --> 2:38:35.040]  But basically, they are trying to bankrupt the people, Yellen is going to bankrupt the
[2:38:35.040 --> 2:38:38.200]  people, and Powell is going to buy up all their assets.
[2:38:38.200 --> 2:38:41.640]  So the Federal Reserve is basically going to own everything.
[2:38:41.640 --> 2:38:42.640]  We're going to own nothing.
[2:38:42.640 --> 2:38:44.960]  It's the exact plan.
[2:38:44.960 --> 2:38:51.840]  So even independently of the forced vaccination and the complete medical martial law, the
[2:38:51.840 --> 2:38:57.480]  economic situation, these people that Biden is put in charge and Powell Trump put in charge,
[2:38:57.480 --> 2:39:02.640]  but these people are coming for everything that we have.
[2:39:02.640 --> 2:39:09.800]  And it is very important that people pay attention to what they need to call their Congress people
[2:39:09.800 --> 2:39:14.440]  and tell them this new control of the currency, a Soviet-born communist, they need to call
[2:39:14.440 --> 2:39:19.040]  their Congress people and tell them, you cannot vote for this person.
[2:39:19.040 --> 2:39:25.280]  You're right, so tell people specifically, because you're dead on, tell folks what they
[2:39:25.280 --> 2:39:29.240]  need to do and what's happening again and what they need to tell Congress not to do.
[2:39:29.240 --> 2:39:35.400]  Well, there's a woman, Amarova, I believe her name is, she's a Soviet-born communist.
[2:39:35.400 --> 2:39:40.440]  Biden just nominated her to be Comptroller of the Currency, so people need to call their
[2:39:40.440 --> 2:39:45.400]  Congress people, their senators, and they need to tell them not to vote for this woman.
[2:39:45.400 --> 2:39:51.320]  Because this is just, you need to cut off the people that these people have in forcing
[2:39:51.320 --> 2:39:52.320]  this agenda.
[2:39:52.320 --> 2:39:56.600]  And folks, specifically when they call Congress or call talk radio, it all has an effect,
[2:39:56.600 --> 2:40:01.320]  or go speak at their state council or go knock on your senator's door in D.C., it's all important.
[2:40:01.320 --> 2:40:05.880]  They just specifically say, do not do this and do not, and they're trying to force this
[2:40:05.880 --> 2:40:10.400]  all through in these build back better bills that are just hellish.
[2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:16.960]  Yeah, I would agree with that, and I'm one final note, I would say Bitcoin just a couple
[2:40:16.960 --> 2:40:22.880]  minutes ago went over 55,000 again, and whatever you think of that, that is the value that
[2:40:22.880 --> 2:40:28.280]  people are putting on assets outside of this central banking currency scheme.
[2:40:28.280 --> 2:40:34.640]  Absolutely, the communist Chinese tried to kill cyber systems, they tried to kill cryptocurrencies.
[2:40:34.640 --> 2:40:39.600]  All the systems are trying to put it down because it shows how weak the other stuff
[2:40:39.600 --> 2:40:40.600]  is.
[2:40:40.600 --> 2:40:42.760]  So even if you don't like cryptocurrencies, folks, and obviously they want to have a global
[2:40:42.760 --> 2:40:46.080]  one they control with blockchain to control us, but any technology can be used for evil
[2:40:46.080 --> 2:40:48.360]  or good.
[2:40:48.360 --> 2:40:51.720]  People ask why a year ago, I finally started getting into Bitcoin, I said I've been watching
[2:40:51.720 --> 2:40:55.480]  it 10 years, it's going to be adopted, I'm not saying it's a sure investment, I would
[2:40:55.480 --> 2:40:59.320]  get into a lot of different ones, and not be speculative, but just learn how it works
[2:40:59.320 --> 2:41:01.600]  because it's good to have something outside the system.
[2:41:01.600 --> 2:41:06.720]  And of course they're going to try to outlaw it, but I said, look, three years ago Max
[2:41:06.720 --> 2:41:10.800]  tried to get me into it, it was 5,000, then it went up to 50 something thousand, and
[2:41:10.800 --> 2:41:13.600]  I said when it went down a few months ago, people go, oh look, you're an idiot, it's
[2:41:13.600 --> 2:41:14.600]  gone down.
[2:41:14.600 --> 2:41:18.640]  I said I didn't get into it for it to go up or down, I got into it to hedge bets, and
[2:41:18.640 --> 2:41:22.120]  just to learn how it works myself instead of just watching it from afar.
[2:41:22.120 --> 2:41:29.400]  And absolutely, that shows you how, look at this sir, a trillion dollar coin, Axios is
[2:41:29.400 --> 2:41:34.760]  selling this, I mean pushing it, the Democrats are all saying they want it, oh, I mean the
[2:41:34.760 --> 2:41:40.880]  Romans did this, the Romans when they were about to collapse 1600 years ago or whatever,
[2:41:40.880 --> 2:41:46.720]  they were sitting there issuing coins that they said paid off the debt and created all
[2:41:46.720 --> 2:41:50.400]  this stuff, this is insanity what they're doing.
[2:41:50.400 --> 2:41:58.720]  Yeah, no, if we have a Federal Reserve that is just making complete clown money, like
[2:41:58.720 --> 2:42:04.760]  a trillion dollar coin, then we do not have a serious country, as long as the Federal Reserve
[2:42:04.760 --> 2:42:10.680]  is still in control of all this, you know, economic policy, that's communism, that is
[2:42:10.680 --> 2:42:15.360]  marks this central economic planning, and people need to keep their eye on the ball
[2:42:15.360 --> 2:42:16.360]  when they...
[2:42:16.360 --> 2:42:21.400]  Well, I mean, do you remember, I forget his name, the Democrat head of the Budget Committee
[2:42:21.400 --> 2:42:27.000]  said on national TV, we can spend any amount of money we want, we have unlimited money.
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:29.360]  John... Yeah, it's the total... What's his name?
[2:42:29.360 --> 2:42:36.000]  The total clown economy, it's not, I mean, it's really not a serious country, as long
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:38.320]  as we have people who are thinking like this.
[2:42:38.320 --> 2:42:43.140]  Yeah, there it is, House Budget Chairman Yarmouth to progressives, the Federal Government can
[2:42:43.140 --> 2:42:47.280]  afford anything, great points, thank you Scott, more calls straight ahead, stay with us, that
[2:42:47.280 --> 2:42:50.480]  was a great call, I should have blown a whole segment on it if it's important, he's damn
[2:42:50.480 --> 2:42:57.200]  right, these people are freaking criminals that hit us with a bio-weapon.
[2:42:57.200 --> 2:43:01.880]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war
[2:43:01.880 --> 2:43:07.480]  between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other
[2:43:07.480 --> 2:43:10.440]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[2:43:10.440 --> 2:43:15.320]  From the United States to Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations
[2:43:15.320 --> 2:43:20.000]  were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government, that's why they launched
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:26.440]  their great recess, and they're program after collapsing us of Build Back Better, this is
[2:43:26.440 --> 2:43:32.640]  nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy, because they couldn't
[2:43:32.640 --> 2:43:37.600]  take our guns, because we wouldn't bow, because the left, which is the ideology of this world
[2:43:37.600 --> 2:43:43.720]  government system, couldn't win, they released a biological weapon on us, now we know, two
[2:43:43.720 --> 2:43:48.360]  years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago, it's that simple, they can't meet us
[2:43:48.360 --> 2:43:53.720]  because of our free speech and our guns, so the global corporate combine released COVID-19
[2:43:53.720 --> 2:43:57.040]  and you know the rest of history, expose this paradigm and we win.
[2:43:57.040 --> 2:44:02.160]  My business model is very, very simple, I want to bring you products that work really,
[2:44:02.160 --> 2:44:07.120]  really well, at affordable prices that are competitive, so that you'll shop with us,
[2:44:07.120 --> 2:44:12.720]  and so we form a relationship, so we're able to stay on air and fight the globalist and
[2:44:12.720 --> 2:44:17.200]  have good products that make us healthy, make us wiser, that boost our immune system, and
[2:44:17.200 --> 2:44:18.200]  that's what we've done.
[2:44:18.200 --> 2:44:22.440]  Now, one area of the immune system we don't talk enough about is deep restful sleep, look
[2:44:22.440 --> 2:44:26.640]  it up for yourself, the effects of deep restful sleep on health and the immune system, and
[2:44:26.640 --> 2:44:30.400]  so with everything we're doing out there to boost our immune system with vitamin D and
[2:44:30.400 --> 2:44:34.320]  zinc and all of it, that's great, but deep restful sleep is just as important, maybe
[2:44:34.320 --> 2:44:40.680]  more important, so infowarstore.com now can announce 50% off on our best-selling product
[2:44:40.680 --> 2:44:45.120]  down and out that just came back in after four months being sold out, it's 50% off,
[2:44:45.120 --> 2:44:49.280]  it's super strong, so be careful with it, if you want deep restful sleep, this will
[2:44:49.280 --> 2:45:18.600]  do it, everybody loves it, five stars, infowarstore.com down and out, now back in stock, 50% off.
[2:45:18.600 --> 2:45:23.160]  How do I know they would do it, because they wrote books and white papers and many of their
[2:45:23.160 --> 2:45:27.960]  own reports and internal meetings were leaked, you see then I was tracking the Bilderberg
[2:45:27.960 --> 2:45:33.160]  group who's head at the time was Klaus Schwab and our sources in cyber confirming to us that
[2:45:33.160 --> 2:45:38.400]  they were indeed planning to launch this great reset, well we're now living in it, the purposeful
[2:45:38.400 --> 2:45:42.720]  collapse of the third world and the first world, none attached to the tyrannical corporate
[2:45:42.720 --> 2:45:48.640]  world government, the total censorship, no due process, destruction of the family and
[2:45:48.640 --> 2:45:54.120]  then incrementally more and more deadly injections of poison mass creating as vaccines to poison
[2:45:54.120 --> 2:46:00.120]  us in the populace, this is what info wars is fighting, we're fighting for the future.
[2:46:00.120 --> 2:46:04.640]  I want to explain something that is absolutely key to understanding our world, it's very
[2:46:04.640 --> 2:46:09.680]  very simple but the most of all don't know, the privately owned central banks of the world
[2:46:09.680 --> 2:46:16.640]  are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies and
[2:46:16.640 --> 2:46:23.960]  using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual property, energy, they're using it to buy
[2:46:23.960 --> 2:46:29.320]  people, to buy influence and in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they
[2:46:29.320 --> 2:46:34.160]  could leverage that manipulate markets but they never allowed that money to get into
[2:46:34.160 --> 2:46:38.080]  the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation, now they've gone ahead
[2:46:38.080 --> 2:46:43.800]  and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy buying up everything
[2:46:43.800 --> 2:46:50.040]  not to have the companies operate but to actually shut them down and force a collapse of civilization
[2:46:50.040 --> 2:46:54.520]  making the companies they do fund the only things left handed, this is the great reset
[2:46:54.520 --> 2:47:12.920]  this is what's happening now, war on everyone, it's the only way to stop it, you're listening
[2:47:12.920 --> 2:47:18.800]  to the Alex Jones show, coming up next segment, Harrison Schaert my favorite person on OAN
[2:47:18.800 --> 2:47:22.800]  now that Jack Mesobic left him, it's just incredible we're going to play that then Robert
[2:47:22.800 --> 2:47:27.640]  Barnes is in studio, we'll cover the economic collapse that they've now implemented, the
[2:47:27.640 --> 2:47:32.600]  bio weapon confirmed they released, I mean we are just living in insane times with Robert
[2:47:32.600 --> 2:47:36.120]  Barnes and how he thinks we can bring these scumbags down, we don't have a choice, we're
[2:47:36.120 --> 2:47:42.040]  going to keep squeezing us and killing us till we do, we don't have a choice do we, let's
[2:47:42.040 --> 2:47:47.000]  go right to your calls now with all these patient awesome folks, Larry in Florida, welcome
[2:47:47.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  Larry go ahead.
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:55.120]  Thank you Alex, appreciate you taking my call and had really two suggestions, excuse me
[2:47:55.120 --> 2:48:02.160]  and one question, first suggestion is real basic, it's what we could do as patriots and
[2:48:02.160 --> 2:48:09.400]  listeners and that is go buy a couple of poster boards, a couple of dollars, the 18x30 or the
[2:48:09.400 --> 2:48:18.400]  24x36 and do like I do and put China Joe time to go and I call it the 10,000 corners or
[2:48:18.400 --> 2:48:25.240]  the Freedom Corners program and get on street corners at rush hour and let folks know what's
[2:48:25.240 --> 2:48:31.280]  going on, I put those together first back in April and they're still valid, first one
[2:48:31.280 --> 2:48:35.960]  says China Joe time to go and absolutely and then you can hand out business cards for a
[2:48:35.960 --> 2:48:41.120]  local Liberty group or save America group and then organize for other events to go out
[2:48:41.120 --> 2:48:46.000]  and be with other groups and it's fun and it's something you're supposed to do and in
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:50.600]  the world we're entering it's going to be life saving to expose these people so you're
[2:48:50.600 --> 2:48:56.680]  absolutely right, we've got to exercise third dimensional demonstrating and third dimensional
[2:48:56.680 --> 2:49:00.080]  information warfare with the truth on the street.
[2:49:00.080 --> 2:49:04.200]  And it's getting to the folks that you know we don't know, that aren't our normal loop
[2:49:04.200 --> 2:49:08.320]  which is I think what we've got to do at this point, otherwise we're talking to each other
[2:49:08.320 --> 2:49:14.280]  and you know I promoted the video Monday night, posted it a bunch of places but it's mostly
[2:49:14.280 --> 2:49:20.760]  places I go to like GAB, well I'm not sure, so that's one suggestion, the second suggestion
[2:49:20.760 --> 2:49:25.840]  is we've got a program here in Florida, a guy that's a thing called coffee and COVID,
[2:49:25.840 --> 2:49:33.640]  5,000 members, local Florida thing on masks and vaccine mandates, what about on the info
[2:49:33.640 --> 2:49:41.400]  wars website, you put up a one paragraph script and three to five contact phone numbers.
[2:49:41.400 --> 2:49:45.400]  Sir, I totally agree and also we did this back when they were trying to push flu shots
[2:49:45.400 --> 2:49:51.080]  and trying to make a mandatory ten years ago with that particular flu bug, we had a contest
[2:49:51.080 --> 2:49:57.000]  for little posters that were just you know regular paper print size, not legal size and
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:50:00.080]  then people hung them everywhere and it got all over the news all over the country and
[2:50:00.080 --> 2:50:03.200]  educated millions so we're about to do that again, beautiful.
[2:50:03.200 --> 2:50:08.040]  Thank you so much for the call Larry and we need to create a system on info wars, it helps
[2:50:08.040 --> 2:50:11.600]  people organize and go to these things, I'm just, I'm trying, we're working around the
[2:50:11.600 --> 2:50:18.400]  clock, we're trying folks so please, you keep fighting as well, the good news is people
[2:50:18.400 --> 2:50:22.080]  are ready to wake up now, it's not hard and those that don't want to hear you just move
[2:50:22.080 --> 2:50:23.080]  on.
[2:50:23.080 --> 2:50:30.280]  All right, up next here is Isaac, Isaac in Texas, welcome.
[2:50:30.280 --> 2:50:36.200]  Hey Alex, I wish you and your crew and your audience well.
[2:50:36.200 --> 2:50:37.200]  Thank you.
[2:50:37.200 --> 2:50:44.440]  I do want to say something that I'm sure a lot of your audience may realize or have
[2:50:44.440 --> 2:50:52.880]  not yet realized, there's more discrimination than going on out there than just the mandates.
[2:50:52.880 --> 2:51:01.800]  I kind of did an experiment and it turned out to be my worst fear here.
[2:51:01.800 --> 2:51:09.600]  I went into several recently, several places that I knew that I could get hired.
[2:51:09.600 --> 2:51:16.240]  What I didn't realize is that the general managers or the managers are all wearing masks
[2:51:16.240 --> 2:51:17.240]  still.
[2:51:17.240 --> 2:51:22.960]  Now, Texas, as you know, you can, in most places anyway, in South Texas here, you can
[2:51:22.960 --> 2:51:28.480]  go into a location and they cannot tell you to put on a mask, most locations, right?
[2:51:28.480 --> 2:51:29.640]  Well, I realize.
[2:51:29.640 --> 2:51:33.640]  But you're not allowed to get a job, the mask is the symbol of the managerial and the slave
[2:51:33.640 --> 2:51:34.640]  class.
[2:51:34.640 --> 2:51:35.640]  Absolutely.
[2:51:35.640 --> 2:51:36.640]  Yes, sir, I agree.
[2:51:36.640 --> 2:51:39.400]  That's what globalism is, that's what they said is we're going to use corporations to
[2:51:39.400 --> 2:51:42.480]  enforce the COVID tyranny and the carbon tyranny.
[2:51:42.480 --> 2:51:50.280]  Well, I can say this, I went to five places, five places, one still is on the line.
[2:51:50.280 --> 2:51:53.520]  I could get later this month, but here's the deal.
[2:51:53.520 --> 2:51:58.560]  As soon as I met the GM, some of the managers in some of these places didn't have the mask
[2:51:58.560 --> 2:52:01.520]  on and took it off when they were talking to me.
[2:52:01.520 --> 2:52:04.560]  Very, very nice people.
[2:52:04.560 --> 2:52:10.200]  But the GM always had the mask and I realized once the calls weren't coming in or when
[2:52:10.200 --> 2:52:17.320]  I would call them and say, hey, I was just in there a few days ago, I'm checking back.
[2:52:17.320 --> 2:52:19.000]  I would just get the run around.
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:25.120]  That's right, the mask is the symbol of subservience and now they're creating databases of your
[2:52:25.120 --> 2:52:27.200]  subservience, it's called the social credit score.
[2:52:27.200 --> 2:52:31.240]  That's why we've got to get online when we still have some social media and build alternatives
[2:52:31.240 --> 2:52:35.800]  like GAB and others and come together and GAB should create, they probably already have
[2:52:35.800 --> 2:52:40.840]  it at job posting area where all these doctors and scientists and nurses that have gone,
[2:52:40.840 --> 2:52:43.480]  I know a lot of doctors and people in Austin, they're going to start their own clinics and
[2:52:43.480 --> 2:52:44.480]  I'm going to go to their clinics.
[2:52:44.480 --> 2:52:45.720]  They'll be my doctor now.
[2:52:45.720 --> 2:52:47.240]  So that's what this is about.
[2:52:47.240 --> 2:52:48.240]  Thank you so much.
[2:52:48.240 --> 2:52:49.960]  Appreciate your call, Isaac.
[2:52:49.960 --> 2:52:52.040]  It's really serious.
[2:52:52.040 --> 2:52:53.800]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[2:52:53.800 --> 2:52:58.000]  Who is up next in the order of the calls being received?
[2:52:58.000 --> 2:53:01.040]  That would be Jim in Michigan.
[2:53:01.040 --> 2:53:02.040]  Jim, welcome.
[2:53:02.040 --> 2:53:10.160]  Hello, Alex, first time caller, been following you for more than 15 years and I just wanted
[2:53:10.160 --> 2:53:17.400]  to touch on the Scott from Michigan that also called the financial collapse and the supply
[2:53:17.400 --> 2:53:25.880]  chain collapse and if these guys get away with what they're doing with the dollar devaluation
[2:53:25.880 --> 2:53:33.880]  and folks should be hedging and getting into different things to protect their dollar, get
[2:53:33.880 --> 2:53:40.640]  their house in order and most importantly, me and my great lady, we've been supporting
[2:53:40.640 --> 2:53:48.280]  you through the whole time for years and we literally don't have room in our small home
[2:53:48.280 --> 2:53:53.480]  to keep what we have and you could ask me what we don't have and it's basically the
[2:53:53.480 --> 2:53:57.520]  new product you have, we have t-shirts, we have booties that really get there.
[2:53:57.520 --> 2:54:00.280]  Brother, you kept this on air and that's changed the world.
[2:54:00.280 --> 2:54:04.320]  The people that info wars, our guest, our callers, myself have influenced has changed
[2:54:04.320 --> 2:54:05.320]  the world.
[2:54:05.320 --> 2:54:08.720]  Now, again, it's really up to God that we do the right thing and then God will do the
[2:54:08.720 --> 2:54:10.160]  rest but this is all a major test.
[2:54:10.160 --> 2:54:11.840]  In fact, put the headline back up.
[2:54:11.840 --> 2:54:12.840]  Look at Drudge Report.
[2:54:12.840 --> 2:54:16.200]  This is what I've been telling you the last few months and now it's here.
[2:54:16.200 --> 2:54:21.160]  Total supply chain breakdown, US edges to default, Pentagon grave warning, McConnell supports
[2:54:21.160 --> 2:54:22.160]  raising debt ceiling.
[2:54:22.160 --> 2:54:26.920]  I mean, we are being maneuvered toward total collapse and they've launched a bio weapon
[2:54:26.920 --> 2:54:33.200]  against us to put us under martial law, to get us used to martial law.
[2:54:33.200 --> 2:54:38.600]  Alex, we've given stuff, products lately within the last year to folks by a vital
[2:54:38.600 --> 2:54:44.400]  mineral fusion and we gave some D3 to a couple folks that traveled on some planes that just
[2:54:44.400 --> 2:54:45.400]  couldn't shake.
[2:54:45.400 --> 2:54:49.920]  They didn't take the vaccine but they couldn't shake what they had and they got better and
[2:54:49.920 --> 2:54:55.680]  we, Chris and I were really excited but it takes us like nearly 10 minutes together to
[2:54:55.680 --> 2:55:00.160]  take everything we take religiously every morning.
[2:55:00.160 --> 2:55:05.720]  We've mixed up vitamin, mineral fusion and then we chase down our prostagard, our krill
[2:55:05.720 --> 2:55:13.040]  oil, our DNA force, our bodies, our brain force and then we do our winter son, our B12,
[2:55:13.040 --> 2:55:14.480]  our X2.
[2:55:14.480 --> 2:55:21.800]  We do all that stuff and every day religiously and we are not afraid, dude, we are ready
[2:55:21.800 --> 2:55:27.240]  to fight like you and we're ready for this to happen and so the best thing that people
[2:55:27.240 --> 2:55:34.160]  can do, if you don't, we're not going to have our money buy these products and keep
[2:55:34.160 --> 2:55:35.720]  them for us online.
[2:55:35.720 --> 2:55:37.480]  Oh, sir, absolutely.
[2:55:37.480 --> 2:55:40.320]  Everybody should be not worried about their attainment, not worried about how fancy your
[2:55:40.320 --> 2:55:42.880]  car is, not worried about keeping up with the Joneses.
[2:55:42.880 --> 2:55:46.760]  People better be getting ready because I didn't want to come out here and say we're probably
[2:55:46.760 --> 2:55:48.800]  going to be in a total depression and war.
[2:55:48.800 --> 2:55:50.320]  Now it looks like it's a certainty.
[2:55:50.320 --> 2:55:54.840]  I mean, we have a communist globalist takeover, they hit us with a bio weapon, they're waging
[2:55:54.840 --> 2:55:58.160]  war, they're wrecking the country from the inside but it doesn't matter.
[2:55:58.160 --> 2:55:59.160]  Get right with God.
[2:55:59.160 --> 2:56:01.000]  That's the most important things your soul.
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:05.160]  Get prepared physically and get prepared with other people that are like-minded.
[2:56:05.160 --> 2:56:06.840]  Groups of people are powerful.
[2:56:06.840 --> 2:56:10.120]  God bless you and I love you and I really appreciate you calling in, sir, in your support.
[2:56:10.120 --> 2:56:12.160]  So here's to you and your family.
[2:56:12.160 --> 2:56:14.760]  Okay, I don't want to cut these callers off.
[2:56:14.760 --> 2:56:17.760]  We only have a minute and a half to break, I'm going to come back and we're going to
[2:56:17.760 --> 2:56:22.920]  air this very important little five minutes with Pearson Sharp and I've got other reports
[2:56:22.920 --> 2:56:23.920]  he's done.
[2:56:23.920 --> 2:56:26.920]  This guy on OAN is just amazing and OAN has always been great.
[2:56:26.920 --> 2:56:28.840]  They are just amazing now.
[2:56:28.840 --> 2:56:34.360]  They are killer and they're getting sued and attacked by the globalists.
[2:56:34.360 --> 2:56:35.360]  That's okay.
[2:56:35.360 --> 2:56:36.360]  They got good share.
[2:56:36.360 --> 2:56:37.640]  They know they're in a war for their country and they're moving forward and they're going
[2:56:37.640 --> 2:56:39.360]  to rig it all against them too.
[2:56:39.360 --> 2:56:43.880]  That's okay because their whole evil Hollywood devil worship or pedophile systems coming
[2:56:43.880 --> 2:56:50.200]  down, they just want to take us down with them as if we care about them pulling their
[2:56:50.200 --> 2:56:51.800]  crap or doing whatever.
[2:56:51.800 --> 2:56:55.360]  We're going to continue to fight no matter what and God is going to provide to us if
[2:56:55.360 --> 2:57:01.320]  we just trust in God and move forward or if I get killed next week, that's what God wants.
[2:57:01.320 --> 2:57:02.320]  I don't want to die.
[2:57:02.320 --> 2:57:03.320]  I'm not going to commit suicide.
[2:57:03.320 --> 2:57:08.560]  I love life, but you've got to get past fear in these people and start fearing God and
[2:57:08.560 --> 2:57:09.560]  start fearing God.
[2:57:09.560 --> 2:57:10.560]  I don't like being fear.
[2:57:10.560 --> 2:57:11.880]  You think God's going to get you.
[2:57:11.880 --> 2:57:16.680]  The fear of being separated from God's spirit that these people don't have.
[2:57:16.680 --> 2:57:18.600]  Do you want to be turned into one of these demon zombies?
[2:57:18.600 --> 2:57:22.080]  Do you want to act like and look like these people and care of their black, white, who
[2:57:22.080 --> 2:57:23.080]  they are?
[2:57:23.080 --> 2:57:24.360]  You look at those folks.
[2:57:24.360 --> 2:57:27.040]  They are living death.
[2:57:27.040 --> 2:57:30.240]  They are death today, death tomorrow, death forever.
[2:57:30.240 --> 2:57:31.240]  It's very sad.
[2:57:31.240 --> 2:57:32.800]  It's not that they're physically dead.
[2:57:32.800 --> 2:57:35.520]  It's that their spirit is dead.
[2:57:35.520 --> 2:57:37.280]  They never bloomed and it's so sad.
[2:57:37.280 --> 2:57:38.760]  It's not a loss.
[2:57:38.760 --> 2:57:39.760]  So don't even get angry yet.
[2:57:39.760 --> 2:57:41.400]  I realize they're just wraiths.
[2:57:41.400 --> 2:57:43.920]  We'll be right back with hour number four.
[2:57:43.920 --> 2:57:47.200]  You're called Robert Barnes and big breaking news.
[2:57:47.200 --> 2:57:51.640]  By now you've heard me talk about the bio pros and how they're creating amazing products.
[2:57:51.640 --> 2:57:57.240]  They've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bio remediation products
[2:57:57.240 --> 2:58:00.600]  bringing industrial level technology to the everyday consumer.
[2:58:00.600 --> 2:58:04.720]  They're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary patented delivery system.
[2:58:04.720 --> 2:58:10.440]  The bio pros are excited to release Bio Drain Pro, a product specifically designed to establish
[2:58:10.440 --> 2:58:13.560]  healthy drains, pipes and overall plumbing systems.
[2:58:13.560 --> 2:58:20.080]  Bio Drain Pro digests grease, fats, oils, sludge, paper and organic matter with ease.
[2:58:20.080 --> 2:58:26.360]  It contains no chemicals, no GMOs and is safe for black, gray holding tanks, sewer hoses
[2:58:26.360 --> 2:58:27.360]  and plumbing.
[2:58:27.360 --> 2:58:29.360]  It is also human and animal safe.
[2:58:29.360 --> 2:58:33.600]  Get up to 20 treatments with the scoop for easy applications.
[2:58:33.600 --> 2:58:39.000]  Say goodbye to drain problems, gas buildup and odor guaranteed.
[2:58:39.000 --> 2:58:40.320]  Just pour and add water.
[2:58:40.320 --> 2:58:41.320]  It's that simple.
[2:58:41.320 --> 2:58:47.800]  Visit the bio pros dot com and see for yourself.
[2:58:47.800 --> 2:58:51.440]  Back in stock, down and out liquid sleep support.
[2:58:51.440 --> 2:58:52.840]  It's been out of stock for a while.
[2:58:52.840 --> 2:58:56.600]  It's one of three sleep aids we have at info or store dot com.
[2:58:56.600 --> 2:58:57.600]  This one has been very popular.
[2:58:57.600 --> 2:58:59.000]  It's sold off the shelves.
[2:58:59.000 --> 2:59:02.920]  It's back in stock, down and out liquid sleep support.
[2:59:02.920 --> 2:59:08.800]  This is probably the strongest sleep aid that we have, I would say.
[2:59:08.800 --> 2:59:13.040]  Knockout, rocket rest, both great, comes in pill form.
[2:59:13.040 --> 2:59:17.280]  This is the liquid tincture and I think this is probably the most powerful one.
[2:59:17.280 --> 2:59:19.160]  Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine.
[2:59:19.160 --> 2:59:24.120]  This is, if you haven't done an iodine challenge yet, have you haven't done the iodine challenge?
[2:59:24.120 --> 2:59:26.080]  What are you waiting for now is the time.
[2:59:26.080 --> 2:59:28.680]  Super male and super female vitality.
[2:59:28.680 --> 2:59:32.600]  Using defense plus and the organic greens fiber caps.
[2:59:32.600 --> 2:59:36.720]  We have a limited supply of these right now, but we want to sell them all out so we can
[2:59:36.720 --> 2:59:37.720]  order a new batch.
[2:59:37.720 --> 2:59:41.320]  It was very popular, the organic green fiber caps, but we have all kinds of other great
[2:59:41.320 --> 2:59:45.080]  supplements that are great for so many different things.
[2:59:45.080 --> 3:00:13.080]  Take advantage of those.
[3:00:13.080 --> 3:00:28.280]  The head of BioNTech, the makers of the wildly successful and profitable Pfizer vaccine, says
[3:00:28.280 --> 3:00:33.320]  he thinks it's pretty likely we'll need a new vaccine by next year to tackle the next
[3:00:33.320 --> 3:00:39.720]  generation of China virus variants, you know, because this vaccine works so well.
[3:00:39.720 --> 3:00:44.760]  I don't remember needing a new polio vaccine every year because the polio virus kept coming
[3:00:44.760 --> 3:00:49.800]  out with new variants, but I guess having an effective vaccine you only need to take
[3:00:49.800 --> 3:00:56.040]  once wouldn't bring in $60 billion a year for Pfizer and Moderna.
[3:00:56.040 --> 3:01:01.440]  BioNTech CEO said there's no reason to believe the next generation of the Fauci flu will be
[3:01:01.440 --> 3:01:03.120]  any easier to deal with.
[3:01:03.120 --> 3:01:08.400]  So by the middle of next year, it's likely a whole new vaccine will be needed and then
[3:01:08.400 --> 3:01:13.480]  a whole new round of secondary doses followed up, of course, by more booster shots.
[3:01:13.480 --> 3:01:18.200]  We're stocking up on Pfizer so we can send Pfizer's stock up.
[3:01:18.200 --> 3:01:23.000]  It's a tight little arrangement, but it means the American people can look forward to endless
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:27.520]  injections with leaky vaccines for the rest of our lives.
[3:01:27.520 --> 3:01:33.400]  The problem with this news is that it clearly demonstrates the vaccines aren't that effective
[3:01:33.400 --> 3:01:34.400]  to begin with.
[3:01:34.400 --> 3:01:41.440]  A recent study shows the vaccines have a 10-fold drop-off in antibodies after just seven months,
[3:01:41.440 --> 3:01:43.600]  and that's following the second dose.
[3:01:43.600 --> 3:01:48.480]  That drop in antibodies means your own body will have a harder time fighting the virus
[3:01:48.480 --> 3:01:53.840]  if you get infected, and that's for all the variants, including Delta, Beta and Mu.
[3:01:53.840 --> 3:01:58.840]  And this is backed up by the latest expose from Project Veritas, which caught scientists
[3:01:58.840 --> 3:02:05.280]  working at Pfizer admitting on camera that the vaccine isn't as effective as your own
[3:02:05.280 --> 3:02:06.280]  natural immunity.
[3:02:06.280 --> 3:02:13.400]  What the vaccine is, like I said, is that protein, so that's just on the outside.
[3:02:13.400 --> 3:02:18.120]  So it's just one antibody against one specific part of the virus.
[3:02:18.120 --> 3:02:22.920]  When you actually get the virus, you're going to start producing antibodies against multiple
[3:02:22.920 --> 3:02:29.040]  pieces of the virus, and not only just like the outside portion, like the inside portion
[3:02:29.040 --> 3:02:36.240]  of the actual virus, so your antibodies are probably better at that rate than the vaccination.
[3:02:36.240 --> 3:02:41.720]  It might be shocking for some to hear, but we want to point out this is what one American
[3:02:41.720 --> 3:02:49.160]  news has been reporting the entire time since the beginning of the pandemic, but our reports
[3:02:49.160 --> 3:02:50.160]  were covered up.
[3:02:50.160 --> 3:02:57.440]  They were censored online, banned by big tech as dangerous misinformation, even though it's
[3:02:57.440 --> 3:03:00.480]  backed up by science.
[3:03:00.480 --> 3:03:04.520]  The latest study the mainstream media isn't talking about and politicians with stock in
[3:03:04.520 --> 3:03:09.760]  Pfizer are trying to cover up shows people who have previously been infected with the
[3:03:09.760 --> 3:03:17.360]  coronavirus continue carrying antibodies for at least 12 months, but likely for much longer.
[3:03:17.360 --> 3:03:23.600]  The peer reviewed study from Finland was published in the European Journal of Immunology on September
[3:03:23.600 --> 3:03:32.240]  24th and found after eight months, 96% of the subjects still had neutralizing antibodies.
[3:03:32.240 --> 3:03:36.880]  After 12 months, the number of people carrying antibodies only dropped by seven points, down
[3:03:36.880 --> 3:03:38.280]  to 89%.
[3:03:38.280 --> 3:03:42.000]  And that includes protection against the virus variants as well, with the vast majority of
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:47.520]  subjects having antibodies against the Delta variant, no booster shot needed.
[3:03:47.520 --> 3:03:52.640]  This is supported by data from Israel, where the largest real world study of the vaccine
[3:03:52.640 --> 3:03:58.920]  ever conducted found that natural immunity affords longer lasting and stronger protection
[3:03:58.920 --> 3:04:04.600]  against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization from the coronavirus than
[3:04:04.600 --> 3:04:06.520]  the COVID vaccine.
[3:04:06.520 --> 3:04:12.080]  But none of this matters, because it contradicts the media and medical establishment's narrative
[3:04:12.080 --> 3:04:13.640]  about COVID.
[3:04:13.640 --> 3:04:18.520]  And you don't want to contradict the high profit of big pharma, the good doctor and
[3:04:18.520 --> 3:04:24.040]  dog murderer Anthony Fauci, do you, heretic?
[3:04:24.040 --> 3:04:29.080]  The bottom line is natural immunity doesn't pay the bills.
[3:04:29.080 --> 3:04:35.520]  And with tens of billions of dollars on the line, our civil liberties are up for grabs.
[3:04:35.520 --> 3:04:44.440]  Our health, our freedoms, our rights as Americans are not for sale at any price, certainly not
[3:04:44.440 --> 3:04:50.640]  for the illusion of security offered by a rushed vaccine that doesn't work as well as
[3:04:50.640 --> 3:04:53.800]  our body's own immune system.
[3:04:53.800 --> 3:04:58.640]  For One American News, I'm Pearson Sharpe.
[3:04:58.640 --> 3:05:04.040]  Could you imagine a year ago walking into a bank with your face covered?
[3:05:04.040 --> 3:05:07.760]  Could you imagine even going into the grocery store, do you think they would let you in?
[3:05:07.760 --> 3:05:10.480]  Do you think they would be following you in the aisles to make sure that you weren't
[3:05:10.480 --> 3:05:12.480]  going to be shoplifting?
[3:05:12.480 --> 3:05:18.160]  Could you imagine going up to a gas station and going inside the little mini-mart to pay
[3:05:18.160 --> 3:05:20.720]  for your gas with a bandana on?
[3:05:20.720 --> 3:05:22.380]  How far do you think that would get you?
[3:05:22.380 --> 3:05:26.800]  Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school with a shield that looks like a space
[3:05:26.800 --> 3:05:28.780]  alien?
[3:05:28.780 --> 3:05:36.880]  Those things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction.
[2:49:16.780 --> 3:06:22.820]  ratings for the last presidential debates were terrible and there's a reason
[3:06:22.820 --> 3:06:23.820]  for that.
[3:06:23.820 --> 3:06:24.820]  They're boring.
[3:06:24.820 --> 3:06:25.820]  Everything is scripted.
[3:06:25.820 --> 3:06:27.420]  You know what they're going to say before they say it.
[3:06:27.420 --> 3:06:33.140]  But if you keep watching the lower tier, the debates lower on the fight card, sometimes
[3:06:33.140 --> 3:06:37.900]  you see something interesting that happens invariably by accident, but it reveals a lot
[3:06:37.900 --> 3:06:40.260]  about the country and the people who are trying to lead it.
[3:06:40.260 --> 3:06:45.140]  That just happened last month in Virginia during a governor's debate.
[3:06:45.140 --> 3:06:47.500]  Terry McAuliffe was the governor of Virginia.
[3:06:47.500 --> 3:06:49.500]  He gravely damaged the state.
[3:06:49.500 --> 3:06:55.460]  He's the career Clinton operative who you may remember from his many brushes with apparent
[3:06:55.460 --> 3:06:56.460]  indictment.
[3:06:56.460 --> 3:06:58.340]  The Washington Post is always telling you he's about to get indicted.
[3:06:58.340 --> 3:06:59.340]  He never was.
[3:06:59.340 --> 3:07:02.260]  Instead, he ran in Virginia and he ran it into the ground and now he wants to hurt it even
[3:07:02.260 --> 3:07:03.260]  more.
[3:07:03.260 --> 3:07:04.260]  So he wants to be reelected.
[3:07:04.260 --> 3:07:08.860]  And at the debate last month, Terry McAuliffe announced, just kind of welled up within him
[3:07:08.860 --> 3:07:14.780]  and he told us that parents no longer have a say in their own children's education, the
[3:07:14.780 --> 3:07:17.460]  one that they pay for.
[3:07:17.460 --> 3:07:21.900]  Instead Terry McAuliffe informed the state of Virginia, the government is in charge of
[3:07:21.900 --> 3:07:22.900]  your child.
[3:07:22.900 --> 3:07:23.900]  Period.
[3:07:23.900 --> 3:07:27.380]  So parents should be telling schools what they should teach, you know, I get really
[3:07:27.380 --> 3:07:30.060]  tired of everybody running down teachers.
[3:07:30.060 --> 3:07:34.300]  I love our teachers and what they have done through COVID, these are real heroes that
[3:07:34.300 --> 3:07:35.900]  deserve our respect.
[3:07:35.900 --> 3:07:39.900]  Well, he's a hack, a liar and a demagogue, but ignore the second part of the sentence.
[3:07:39.900 --> 3:07:45.540]  I don't think parents have any right telling teachers what to teach, really.
[3:07:45.540 --> 3:07:47.340]  So parents don't control their own kids.
[3:07:47.340 --> 3:07:50.700]  Do you have a right to tell the pediatrician what kind of medical treatment your kids should
[3:07:50.700 --> 3:07:51.700]  get?
[3:07:51.700 --> 3:07:53.100]  No.
[3:07:53.100 --> 3:07:54.420]  This is the new rule.
[3:07:54.420 --> 3:07:58.300]  The government makes all key decisions about your children.
[3:07:58.300 --> 3:08:01.940]  That's not just true in the state of Virginia, it is now orthodoxy throughout the entire
[3:08:01.940 --> 3:08:03.340]  Democratic Party.
[3:08:03.340 --> 3:08:09.740]  And as of yesterday, this idea unprecedented in the history of America has the full backing
[3:08:09.740 --> 3:08:12.540]  of the Biden administration, in other words, of the entire federal government.
[3:08:12.540 --> 3:08:16.260]  And if you disagree with that, if you're one of those troglodytes who thinks you should
[3:08:16.260 --> 3:08:20.620]  have some say in what your children are taught in the schools that you pay for, you should
[3:08:20.620 --> 3:08:24.900]  know the Biden administration now views you as a domestic terrorist.
[3:08:24.900 --> 3:08:29.100]  And they are fully willing to use the armed agents of the state to compel you to shut
[3:08:29.100 --> 3:08:30.100]  up.
[3:08:30.100 --> 3:08:33.620]  Joe Biden's Justice Department has made that very, very clear.
[3:08:33.620 --> 3:08:37.020]  Attorney General Merrick Garland, remember the moderate, soft-spoken one, who turned
[3:08:37.020 --> 3:08:40.020]  out to be not moderate at all, but a wild-eyed, radical, crazy person?
[3:08:40.020 --> 3:08:41.020]  He's now the Attorney General.
[3:08:41.020 --> 3:08:47.540]  He issued a memorandum yesterday calling on the FBI to crack down on parents who complain
[3:08:47.540 --> 3:08:48.700]  about their school board.
[3:08:48.700 --> 3:08:53.460]  Now, keep in mind, at this exact moment that Garland wrote that, we learned that murders
[3:08:53.460 --> 3:08:57.700]  in the United States, since the advent of Black Lives Matter, have gone up 30 percent.
[3:08:57.700 --> 3:08:59.620]  So that's thousands more dead people.
[3:08:59.620 --> 3:09:02.140]  This is the Attorney General, our Chief Law Enforcement Officer.
[3:09:02.140 --> 3:09:03.900]  He did not issue a memo about that.
[3:09:03.900 --> 3:09:08.340]  He issued instead a memo about people who are committing wrongthink.
[3:09:08.340 --> 3:09:13.140]  Garland directed, quote, federal, state, tribal, territorial, and local law enforcement leaders
[3:09:13.140 --> 3:09:17.580]  to discuss strategies for addressing this disturbing trend, this disturbing trend being
[3:09:17.580 --> 3:09:19.220]  parents complaining.
[3:09:19.220 --> 3:09:23.860]  In the coming days, Garland wrote, the department will announce a series of measures designed
[3:09:23.860 --> 3:09:30.060]  to address the rise in criminal conduct directed towards school personnel.
[3:09:30.060 --> 3:09:31.060]  Criminal conduct?
[3:09:31.060 --> 3:09:32.900]  What does that consist of?
[3:09:32.900 --> 3:09:33.900]  Bombings?
[3:09:33.900 --> 3:09:34.900]  Assaults?
[3:09:34.900 --> 3:09:35.900]  No.
[3:09:35.900 --> 3:09:36.900]  Complaining.
[3:09:36.900 --> 3:09:40.380]  It is now criminal to disagree with your kid's school.
[3:09:40.380 --> 3:09:42.500]  What have we learned from this?
[3:09:42.500 --> 3:09:45.500]  Well, among other things we've learned, the Biden administration no longer believes in
[3:09:45.500 --> 3:09:48.860]  the most basic precepts of liberal democracy.
[3:09:48.860 --> 3:09:51.640]  Among them, your freedom of speech should never be abridged.
[3:09:51.640 --> 3:09:58.540]  The government must convince you, not compel you, almost always, and you and not the government
[3:09:58.540 --> 3:10:00.580]  is in charge of your children.
[3:10:00.580 --> 3:10:02.780]  Merrick Garland did not give birth to your kids.
[3:10:02.780 --> 3:10:06.540]  They're yours, not his, but they don't acknowledge that anymore.
[3:10:06.540 --> 3:10:11.420]  So they're happy to use armed agents of the state to enforce their ideology, and they
[3:10:11.420 --> 3:10:15.900]  have to, because that ideology is deeply unpopular with most Americans.
[3:10:15.900 --> 3:10:19.700]  Now, why did the DOJ issue this letter?
[3:10:19.700 --> 3:10:24.540]  Well, because they'd received a complaint from the National School Board's Association,
[3:10:24.540 --> 3:10:29.100]  huge donors, of course, to the Democratic Party, and that complaint cited citizens who
[3:10:29.100 --> 3:10:34.180]  were upset over the teachings of, quote, critical race theory and of masking of children, which
[3:10:34.180 --> 3:10:36.100]  is medically unnecessary.
[3:10:36.100 --> 3:10:39.700]  So the group wrote to the Biden administration and said that some of the actions against
[3:10:39.700 --> 3:10:46.220]  the school boards, quote, could be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes.
[3:10:46.220 --> 3:10:49.940]  Oh, so school administrators are now a protected group.
[3:10:49.940 --> 3:10:54.700]  If you disagree with them, you're committing a hate crime, not voicing an opinion, which
[3:10:54.700 --> 3:10:55.860]  is constitutionally protected.
[3:10:55.860 --> 3:10:58.420]  No, it's an act of violence to disagree with them.
[3:10:58.420 --> 3:10:59.420]  Let's get specific.
[3:10:59.420 --> 3:11:03.380]  According to the National School Board's Association, it's things like this, quote,
[3:11:03.380 --> 3:11:07.860]  earlier this month, a student in Tennessee was mocked during a board meeting for advocating
[3:11:07.860 --> 3:11:12.020]  masks in schools after testifying to this grandmother who was an educator, died because
[3:11:12.020 --> 3:11:13.020]  of COVID-19.
[3:11:13.020 --> 3:11:18.300]  Now, the association went on to say that the feds should use, quote, the Patriot Act,
[3:11:18.300 --> 3:11:23.100]  created after 9-11, to the regret of most thinking people, and that postal inspectors
[3:11:23.100 --> 3:11:27.940]  should probe the, quote, cyberbullying school board members claim they have faced.
[3:11:27.940 --> 3:11:28.940]  So where does this leave us?
[3:11:28.940 --> 3:11:30.700]  Really simple.
[3:11:30.700 --> 3:11:36.580]  Mocking someone who calls for medically unnecessary mask mandates is now domestic terrorism and
[3:11:36.580 --> 3:11:41.660]  a chief concern of the FBI, which you're not allowed to do going forward because it's
[3:11:41.660 --> 3:11:47.220]  a hate crime, is point out that children and teens actually aren't dying from COVID.
[3:11:47.220 --> 3:11:48.220]  They're dying from a lot of things.
[3:11:48.220 --> 3:11:52.580]  Well, there's the great Tucker Carlson and Robert Barnes, another great constitutional
[3:11:52.580 --> 3:11:54.660]  lawyer and Patriot is here with us.
[3:11:54.660 --> 3:11:59.140]  He's going to be on the war room today in the first hour, 3 p.m. hour.
[3:11:59.140 --> 3:12:01.140]  Oh, he's got a bunch of other huge guests as well.
[3:12:01.140 --> 3:12:05.180]  And he'll be on the American Journal tomorrow morning, and he's here in Texas on a secret
[3:12:05.180 --> 3:12:09.660]  mission he can't tell you about, but let's just say all the news coming out and all the
[3:12:09.660 --> 3:12:13.540]  insiders coming out and exposing what happened with Big Pharma and what you've seen with
[3:12:13.540 --> 3:12:16.620]  Project Veritas and all that, there's a lot of that going on.
[3:12:16.620 --> 3:12:21.380]  Barnes, I look at Fauci bragging three years ago on TV that they were going to release
[3:12:21.380 --> 3:12:24.060]  the deadly virus to bring in total control.
[3:12:24.060 --> 3:12:27.500]  That's now the top of DavidPunna.com.
[3:12:27.500 --> 3:12:33.300]  And just all this insanity and the major federal regulator resigning because he was involved
[3:12:33.300 --> 3:12:34.300]  in it.
[3:12:34.300 --> 3:12:36.500]  And this is an amazing time to be alive, isn't it?
[3:12:36.500 --> 3:12:37.500]  Oh, no doubt about it.
[3:12:37.500 --> 3:12:38.940]  I mean, it's an extraordinary effort.
[3:12:38.940 --> 3:12:42.700]  It's a culmination of sort of decades of efforts where the goal and objective and the idea
[3:12:42.700 --> 3:12:46.380]  has been to have, you know, complete control over the body and of the mind of the ordinary
[3:12:46.380 --> 3:12:48.780]  citizen and ordinary person around the world.
[3:12:48.780 --> 3:12:52.420]  And they're trying to achieve it and accomplish it by a wide range of objectives and they're
[3:12:52.420 --> 3:12:54.780]  closer to achieving that than ever before.
[3:12:54.780 --> 3:12:59.460]  But they're also the greatest pushback in the history of this is also occurring that's
[3:12:59.460 --> 3:13:00.860]  greater than ever before.
[3:13:00.860 --> 3:13:04.100]  So you combine that and it's an extraordinary time to be alive.
[3:13:04.100 --> 3:13:05.660]  That's the old Chinese proverb.
[3:13:05.660 --> 3:13:07.660]  May you live in interesting times.
[3:13:07.660 --> 3:13:09.980]  Robert, where should we start?
[3:13:09.980 --> 3:13:16.420]  I mean, there's just so much insanity, Taiwan and China on the edge of war, vaccine mandates
[3:13:16.420 --> 3:13:21.300]  in California and New York and LA County saying, oh, you can't go in any buildings now without
[3:13:21.300 --> 3:13:23.620]  a shot, not grocery stores, not anywhere.
[3:13:23.620 --> 3:13:24.860]  That's beyond France's.
[3:13:24.860 --> 3:13:27.100]  I mean, this is just insane.
[3:13:27.100 --> 3:13:28.100]  Multiple levels.
[3:13:28.100 --> 3:13:31.180]  I filed suit this week against Tyson Foods because they decided that anybody who had
[3:13:31.180 --> 3:13:35.740]  a pro-life belief, anybody who had a religious objection to the vaccine, and there's many
[3:13:35.740 --> 3:13:39.520]  reasons why someone may have a religious objection to the vaccine, it may be because
[3:13:39.520 --> 3:13:43.940]  aborted fetal cells was used in the production or development of these vaccines.
[3:13:43.940 --> 3:13:48.780]  It may be because the body is a temple according to many religious beliefs and putting foreign
[3:13:48.780 --> 3:13:52.900]  toxins of uncertain long term effects is not something that is consistent with someone's
[3:13:52.900 --> 3:13:58.340]  religious beliefs, or it may be because informed consent is somebody's religious belief or
[3:13:58.340 --> 3:13:59.340]  like it.
[3:13:59.340 --> 3:14:03.260]  If you want people to know legally, your belief just has to be something that is a deeply
[3:14:03.260 --> 3:14:05.740]  held moral belief that is like a religion.
[3:14:05.740 --> 3:14:09.260]  It doesn't have to come from a recognized religious belief.
[3:14:09.260 --> 3:14:13.260]  The EEOC, Biden's own EEOC admits this right on their own site.
[3:14:13.260 --> 3:14:16.940]  So look at something like informed consent, there are people who believe that any medicine
[3:14:16.940 --> 3:14:21.340]  that is done in violation or contravention of informed consent offends their core spiritual
[3:14:21.340 --> 3:14:26.220]  moral beliefs and how it's a violation of their bodily temple.
[3:14:26.220 --> 3:14:30.740]  And so my religion is I'm my own property, not made by you.
[3:14:30.740 --> 3:14:31.740]  Exactly.
[3:14:31.740 --> 3:14:33.900]  And look at something like informed consent.
[3:14:33.900 --> 3:14:38.480]  Informed consent is one of the deeply held moral beliefs that so strongly held, we killed
[3:14:38.480 --> 3:14:42.220]  people over it who violated it, and that's what Nuremberg was all about.
[3:14:42.220 --> 3:14:46.440]  We went in and we said these people, there was no existing treaty, there was no existing
[3:14:46.440 --> 3:14:49.020]  Nuremberg code prior to the Nuremberg trials.
[3:14:49.020 --> 3:14:54.620]  We said those universal moral beliefs are so strongly shared amongst the civilized world.
[3:14:54.620 --> 3:14:56.100]  And we're going to break your neck.
[3:14:56.100 --> 3:14:57.100]  Exactly.
[3:14:57.100 --> 3:15:01.140]  And if it's, how many could you have a more deeply held moral belief than something that
[3:15:01.140 --> 3:15:04.260]  allows you to execute someone for violating it?
[3:15:04.260 --> 3:15:09.540]  And so under those circumstances, the federal government is trying to, and a bunch of employers
[3:15:09.540 --> 3:15:11.860]  are trying to limit religious accommodations.
[3:15:11.860 --> 3:15:14.460]  There's multiple grounds for those religious accommodations.
[3:15:14.460 --> 3:15:19.640]  You can list all of the grounds, and I recommend people listing all of the grounds they have
[3:15:19.640 --> 3:15:23.980]  a religious objection to, because if they violate those religious accommodations, that's
[3:15:23.980 --> 3:15:27.300]  a violation of Title VII, that's a violation of their constitutional rights, that's a
[3:15:27.300 --> 3:15:30.300]  state actor, violation of the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act, that's the federal
[3:15:30.300 --> 3:15:31.300]  government.
[3:15:31.300 --> 3:15:33.380]  And we need to keep talking about people's rights.
[3:15:33.380 --> 3:15:37.340]  I know as an audience, most of us know this, we need to remember these and stand up and
[3:15:37.340 --> 3:15:38.340]  say no.
[3:15:38.340 --> 3:15:41.460]  It's like Dr. Bartlett said here today, most of these hospitals won't give you Budesta
[3:15:41.460 --> 3:15:45.820]  9 and Ivermectin, they're on record curing people, so until you get in their face, you've
[3:15:45.820 --> 3:15:47.340]  got to start standing up for yourselves.
[3:15:47.340 --> 3:15:50.460]  And I know as an audience, you're doing that, but this is serious.
[3:15:50.460 --> 3:15:51.460]  This is war.
[3:15:51.460 --> 3:15:57.860]  Let's get a ride back with Robert Barnes.
[3:15:57.860 --> 3:16:01.940]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood-burning fireplace
[3:16:01.940 --> 3:16:04.100]  and not spend thousands doing it?
[3:16:04.100 --> 3:16:07.020]  You can with Great Wall of Fire Fireplace Grates.

[3:16:26.660 --> 3:16:32.140]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[3:16:32.140 --> 3:16:33.140]  Me too.
[3:16:33.140 --> 3:16:37.300]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[3:16:37.300 --> 3:16:40.060]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[3:16:40.060 --> 3:16:44.420]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[3:16:44.420 --> 3:16:46.140]  You probably already believe that.
[3:16:46.140 --> 3:16:47.340]  I certainly do.
[3:16:47.340 --> 3:16:48.340]  So here's the thing.
[3:16:48.340 --> 3:16:52.700]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually
[3:16:52.700 --> 3:16:56.860]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[3:16:56.860 --> 3:17:02.580]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.

[3:17:26.980 --> 3:17:29.100]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:17:29.100 --> 3:17:33.020]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:17:33.020 --> 3:17:34.580]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:17:34.580 --> 3:17:37.540]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:37.540 --> 3:17:40.820]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[3:17:40.820 --> 3:17:43.060]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:17:43.060 --> 3:17:44.380]  I can help you too.
[3:17:44.380 --> 3:17:47.380]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:17:47.380 --> 3:17:49.620]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:17:49.620 --> 3:18:17.620]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:18:17.620 --> 3:18:24.980]  I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the cans.
[3:18:24.980 --> 3:18:33.660]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[3:18:33.660 --> 3:18:40.620]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that
[3:18:40.620 --> 3:18:43.940]  only I own profitable.
[3:18:43.940 --> 3:18:51.340]  You will then be my slaves, oh, and then you get that special shot of rhythm from Cobra
[3:18:51.340 --> 3:18:56.740]  that will remove your immune system so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable
[3:18:56.740 --> 3:18:58.740]  lives.
[3:18:58.740 --> 3:19:05.020]  The engineers at BioProse are very excited to announce a major expansion of new products
[3:19:05.020 --> 3:19:07.820]  into the retail consumer market.
[3:19:07.820 --> 3:19:11.700]  Since their rollout of their first product almost a year ago, they come out with four
[3:19:11.700 --> 3:19:13.260]  new products.
[3:19:13.260 --> 3:19:20.460]  Bio Drain Pro, Bio RV Pro, Bio Marine Pro, and Bio Porta Pro.
[3:19:20.460 --> 3:19:27.060]  For decades, oil companies and other major chemical corporations have been using patented,
[3:19:27.060 --> 3:19:34.220]  naturally occurring, specially bred bacteria to eat oil spills and other toxic waste disasters.
[3:19:34.220 --> 3:19:37.820]  That's how powerful these naturally occurring microbes are.
[3:19:37.820 --> 3:19:43.340]  The BioProse system is light years better than traditional enzymes that only work once.
[3:19:43.340 --> 3:19:47.380]  These bacteria begin to breed and live in your septic tank.
[3:19:47.380 --> 3:19:52.700]  And now it's available for the general public's use for the first time on the retail market,
[3:19:52.700 --> 3:20:14.980]  exclusively available at TheBioProse.com.
[3:20:14.980 --> 3:20:23.180]  Time for war has been on the air for 28 years, everything we've done, thousands and thousands
[3:20:23.180 --> 3:20:28.100]  of shows, thousands of interviews, hundreds of thousands of calls, every step on the path
[3:20:28.100 --> 3:20:34.900]  to this moment where humanity is now, the global, scientific elite of eugenicists, carrying
[3:20:34.900 --> 3:20:39.620]  out the beginning of depopulation, hiding the very attack of supposedly a life-giving
[3:20:39.620 --> 3:20:43.540]  injection to protect you from what they themselves created in the lab.
[3:20:43.540 --> 3:20:48.700]  And now the Pentagon's home report shows those that have had COVID and then are forcing
[3:20:48.700 --> 3:20:51.940]  it to the vaccine don't really have a lot of problems.
[3:20:51.940 --> 3:20:57.340]  It's people that never had COVID and took the vaccine, get COVID and die.
[3:20:57.340 --> 3:21:02.620]  Because the COVID vaccine creates in the body, at a much higher level, what is in COVID itself.
[3:21:02.620 --> 3:21:04.940]  And now it's all coming out.
[3:21:04.940 --> 3:21:08.460]  Robert Barnes is here and during the break, he was really tying it all together.
[3:21:08.460 --> 3:21:09.460]  I said, there's so much to cover.
[3:21:09.460 --> 3:21:10.460]  What do you want to hit next?
[3:21:10.460 --> 3:21:15.180]  He said, what Biden did in June, what we talked about and how the critical race theory, the
[3:21:15.180 --> 3:21:19.500]  forced inoculations, all of it is about bringing in and then he elaborated, I said, please
[3:21:19.500 --> 3:21:20.500]  say that on air.
[3:21:20.500 --> 3:21:24.620]  So from a legal historical perspective, explain how this, we were saying during the break,
[3:21:24.620 --> 3:21:26.980]  this is all part of a concerted move.
[3:21:26.980 --> 3:21:27.980]  Absolutely.
[3:21:27.980 --> 3:21:31.900]  I mean, basically it's a political purge on steroids because what you're looking at is
[3:21:31.900 --> 3:21:35.620]  all of these things achieve the same objective that, you know, the domestic terror label
[3:21:35.620 --> 3:21:40.860]  started with January 6, anybody that was associated or affiliated with anybody who had problems
[3:21:40.860 --> 3:21:44.780]  with the election, all of a sudden is a potential domestic terrorist.
[3:21:44.780 --> 3:21:50.740]  Then it goes to critical race theory, anybody who disagrees with these radicalized ideas
[3:21:50.740 --> 3:21:54.100]  that not only Millie is preaching within the military, so there's an effort to purge people
[3:21:54.100 --> 3:21:58.300]  within the military establishment, the federal government, if they disagree with these radical
[3:21:58.300 --> 3:22:02.700]  ideas, but now it's reached out to school boards and to where if parents or students
[3:22:02.700 --> 3:22:08.180]  disagree with it, now they get put on a domestic terror list potential list.
[3:22:08.180 --> 3:22:09.660]  And now who else is it going to extend to?
[3:22:09.660 --> 3:22:14.540]  It's going to extend to people who question the efficacy, the safety or the necessity
[3:22:14.540 --> 3:22:19.180]  of the vaccine from either a philosophical, religious or medical perspective.
[3:22:19.180 --> 3:22:23.660]  And what's happening is anybody who refuses the vaccine is getting put on a list.
[3:22:23.660 --> 3:22:27.980]  What people don't realize is that anybody who gets vaccinated in order to validate the
[3:22:27.980 --> 3:22:33.540]  identity cards of those vaccines, the information is going into a centralized database so the
[3:22:33.540 --> 3:22:37.100]  government knows who has taken the vaccine and by inference who has not.
[3:22:37.100 --> 3:22:41.900]  And consequently, they are ultimately going to get added to the same potentially dangerous
[3:22:41.900 --> 3:22:45.280]  list, potential domestic terrorist list.
[3:22:45.280 --> 3:22:50.420]  So it's the same objective of purging, one, identifying those people that are dissidents,
[3:22:50.420 --> 3:22:54.780]  those people willing to challenge and question the system, those people willing to be potential
[3:22:54.780 --> 3:22:59.700]  neos in the matrix and in the same level it is purging them from institutional influence
[3:22:59.700 --> 3:23:04.740]  to denying them employment, denying them education, denying them military service, all of it.
[3:23:04.740 --> 3:23:10.340]  So it's a massive Stalin-esque political purge in the guise of public health, in the guise
[3:23:10.340 --> 3:23:15.220]  of public education, in the guise of domestic terror risk.
[3:23:15.220 --> 3:23:21.060]  It's the cover as Klaus Schwab says for their global police state digital tracking carbon
[3:23:21.060 --> 3:23:22.940]  tax takeover and then they admit it.
[3:23:22.940 --> 3:23:26.300]  I mean, what's insane for new listeners tuning in and people that make fun of us?
[3:23:26.300 --> 3:23:29.740]  This is all books they've written, articles, and this is here.
[3:23:29.740 --> 3:23:33.020]  It's like the fact-checking saying Bill Gates never said depopulate the earth, then I show
[3:23:33.020 --> 3:23:36.980]  you articles him quoting saying he wants it video clips and then his foundation giving
[3:23:36.980 --> 3:23:37.980]  awards for depopulation.
[3:23:37.980 --> 3:23:38.980]  Oh, precisely.
[3:23:38.980 --> 3:23:42.940]  I mean, you look at, I mean, Gates hasn't hidden what his agenda has been, nor did his
[3:23:42.940 --> 3:23:44.540]  father, nor did his grandfather.
[3:23:44.540 --> 3:23:48.180]  I mean, they've long been eugenicist supporters at one level or another.
[3:23:48.180 --> 3:23:50.620]  It's the real reason he's hanging out with Jeffrey Epstein.
[3:23:50.620 --> 3:23:54.780]  He's not likely hanging out with Jeffrey Epstein to chase young women.
[3:23:54.780 --> 3:23:57.620]  He's hanging out with Jeffrey Epstein because Epstein's also a eugenicist.
[3:23:57.620 --> 3:24:02.020]  Well, they were using the young women to compromise top scientists.
[3:24:02.020 --> 3:24:06.020]  Not only that, they're also, I mean, the whole idea was to create a superior race.
[3:24:06.020 --> 3:24:09.620]  I have no idea that I would not be surprised at all.
[3:24:09.620 --> 3:24:14.380]  Bill Gates shared Epstein's belief that a certain group of elite should create a super
[3:24:14.380 --> 3:24:15.380]  class.
[3:24:15.380 --> 3:24:16.380]  Yeah, that was the plan.
[3:24:16.380 --> 3:24:19.340]  I told people this before I was on the news because I was told this by sources that they
[3:24:19.340 --> 3:24:22.580]  wanted to court breed elites with women to create more of the super race.
[3:24:22.580 --> 3:24:23.580]  Absolutely.
[3:24:23.580 --> 3:24:26.300]  I mean, Epstein was setting up to do exactly that at his camp in Arizona.
[3:24:26.300 --> 3:24:30.180]  Of course, the women would have to be chosen for their stimulating attributes.
[3:24:30.180 --> 3:24:35.220]  This would be a ratio of 10 women per male in the bunker.
[3:24:35.220 --> 3:24:38.020]  Animals would have to be bred and slaughtered.
[3:24:38.020 --> 3:24:39.020]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:24:39.020 --> 3:24:40.020]  I mean, it's Dr. Strangelove.
[3:24:40.020 --> 3:24:45.060]  I mean, the reason why all of those films were with Dr. Strangelove, Space Odyssey 2001,
[3:24:45.060 --> 3:24:48.700]  all the other films that Kubrick did, they had a common theme, all he was really detailing
[3:24:48.700 --> 3:24:51.580]  and describing is the actual belief structure and goals.
[3:24:51.580 --> 3:24:54.780]  And his daughter told me that because they tried to get, obviously, they tried to get
[3:24:54.780 --> 3:24:55.780]  him into everything.
[3:24:55.780 --> 3:24:57.020]  He said, hell no.
[3:24:57.020 --> 3:24:59.100]  But yeah, Eyes Wide Shut, all that stuff's real.
[3:24:59.100 --> 3:25:00.100]  Absolutely.
[3:25:00.100 --> 3:25:03.700]  I mean, Dr. Strangelove was based on inside information he had from high ranking defense
[3:25:03.700 --> 3:25:04.700]  people.
[3:25:04.700 --> 3:25:05.700]  On real people.
[3:25:05.700 --> 3:25:06.700]  Absolutely.
[3:25:06.700 --> 3:25:07.700]  I mean, we now know.
[3:25:07.700 --> 3:25:09.700]  L.L. Limnitzer and Curtis LeMay and then a German scientist.
[3:25:09.700 --> 3:25:10.700]  Exactly.
[3:25:10.700 --> 3:25:11.700]  People forget.
[3:25:11.700 --> 3:25:14.740]  I mean, all you have to do is really read the Operation Northwoods documents to understand
[3:25:14.740 --> 3:25:17.420]  the mindset of those people and those people who were...
[3:25:17.420 --> 3:25:19.380]  You said, I can walk.
[3:25:19.380 --> 3:25:20.380]  Exactly.
[3:25:20.380 --> 3:25:21.380]  I mean, it was genius.
[3:25:21.380 --> 3:25:22.900]  I mean, brilliant comedic performance.
[3:25:22.900 --> 3:25:23.900]  A brilliant...
[3:25:23.900 --> 3:25:27.180]  Like he said that the only way he could come to terms with the shocking information was
[3:25:27.180 --> 3:25:28.740]  to tell it in a comedic parody.
[3:25:28.740 --> 3:25:30.700]  And the sad thing is he wasn't ever going to make a comedy.
[3:25:30.700 --> 3:25:31.700]  Exactly.
[3:25:31.700 --> 3:25:32.700]  He set out to Megan.
[3:25:32.700 --> 3:25:33.700]  So this is too hardcore.
[3:25:33.700 --> 3:25:34.700]  Absolutely.
[3:25:34.700 --> 3:25:37.220]  I mean, how do you deal with something so horrific, so unbelievable, like the end of
[3:25:37.220 --> 3:25:38.460]  the human race?
[3:25:38.460 --> 3:25:39.660]  Because you've got a couple of nut jobs.
[3:25:39.660 --> 3:25:41.260]  This is about Operation Northwoods.
[3:25:41.260 --> 3:25:46.020]  Limnitzer wasn't just like General Jack T. Ripper, the launch plan R. They were going
[3:25:46.020 --> 3:25:50.460]  to get the Soviets to attack us by staging attacks on ourselves so the U.S. could attack
[3:25:50.460 --> 3:25:52.540]  them and then start World War III.
[3:25:52.540 --> 3:25:54.700]  And so this film is about Operation Northwoods.
[3:25:54.700 --> 3:25:55.700]  Exactly.
[3:25:55.700 --> 3:25:57.860]  And people wonder, you know, how could you get to that mindset?
[3:25:57.860 --> 3:26:01.900]  You get to that mindset when you don't really believe in all of humanity, when you believe
[3:26:01.900 --> 3:26:03.700]  that a small elite group was all that...
[3:26:03.700 --> 3:26:06.140]  Well, I didn't say we were going to have a mosque.
[3:26:06.140 --> 3:26:07.140]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:26:07.140 --> 3:26:08.140]  I mean, it's...
[3:26:08.140 --> 3:26:09.140]  20, 30 million tops.
[3:26:09.140 --> 3:26:13.580]  People would be shocked at the degree to which that whole George C. Scott routine was the
[3:26:13.580 --> 3:26:17.940]  actual belief structure of people in high levels of power during that time period.
[3:26:17.940 --> 3:26:21.020]  And all you have to do is, like I said, read something like Operation Northwoods that they
[3:26:21.020 --> 3:26:22.740]  kept secret for 36 years.
[3:26:22.740 --> 3:26:25.820]  That tells you the mindset, the mentality of these people.
[3:26:25.820 --> 3:26:27.500]  They really thought Kennedy would sign off on it.
[3:26:27.500 --> 3:26:29.780]  And guys, you've got to search web or images to find Northwoods.
[3:26:29.780 --> 3:26:38.380]  ABC News, April 9th, 2020, Pentagon Joint Chiefs of Staff plan to attack U.S. personnel for
[3:26:38.380 --> 3:26:39.780]  pretext for war with Cuba.
[3:26:39.780 --> 3:26:40.780]  Exactly.
[3:26:40.780 --> 3:26:41.780]  That's the headline.
[3:26:41.780 --> 3:26:45.300]  One of the most popular film and popular books we've talked about, John Le Carré or others,
[3:26:45.300 --> 3:26:48.220]  James Elroy, you're talking about people who are ceding the truth.
[3:26:48.220 --> 3:26:52.180]  I mean, Elroy used to say if they honestly sold his American tabloid trilogy, the guy
[3:26:52.180 --> 3:26:56.180]  of LA Confidential, they would put it in the history section, not in the fiction section.
[3:26:56.180 --> 3:26:59.420]  And his goal and objective was to be able to filter out truth in ways that you could
[3:26:59.420 --> 3:27:00.980]  only disguise as fiction.
[3:27:00.980 --> 3:27:04.500]  And John Le Carré did the same thing, from the spy who came in from the cold to Russia
[3:27:04.500 --> 3:27:07.620]  House to Taylor Panamot to Constant Gardner.
[3:27:07.620 --> 3:27:09.340]  You know what's Constant Gardner about?
[3:27:09.340 --> 3:27:12.700]  It's about bogus clinical trials being done, it's medically experimenting.
[3:27:12.700 --> 3:27:14.220]  Did you mention the quiet American?
[3:27:14.220 --> 3:27:16.260]  Yeah, quiet America is another fantastic one.
[3:27:16.260 --> 3:27:17.260]  So I mean, that's a Graham Greene.
[3:27:17.260 --> 3:27:21.420]  And you go to Armand Havala, another great Graham Greene book and movie.
[3:27:21.420 --> 3:27:22.420]  And where did he learn that from?
[3:27:22.420 --> 3:27:27.020]  He learned that from actually witnessing it in Africa, watching spies just make up stories.
[3:27:27.020 --> 3:27:29.660]  Because that's how they monetize their information.
[3:27:29.660 --> 3:27:31.700]  I mean, that's where Russiagate was.
[3:27:31.700 --> 3:27:32.700]  Russiagate was just the retellers.
[3:27:32.700 --> 3:27:33.700]  Oh, that's a whole other issue.
[3:27:33.700 --> 3:27:34.700]  People asked me to respond.
[3:27:34.700 --> 3:27:36.020]  They've now indicted people.
[3:27:36.020 --> 3:27:37.020]  It's all fake.
[3:27:37.020 --> 3:27:41.340]  Folks, they had congressional hearings saying, I am a Russian agent with no proof and I'd
[3:27:41.340 --> 3:27:44.940]  be outside trying to come in, they wouldn't even let me, you know, face my accuser.
[3:27:44.940 --> 3:27:46.780]  Yes, I know Russiagate was fake.
[3:27:46.780 --> 3:27:47.780]  Believe me.
[3:27:47.780 --> 3:27:48.780]  Oh, completely.
[3:27:48.780 --> 3:27:52.180]  I mean, what's amazing about that is John Durham had that information for a year.
[3:27:52.180 --> 3:27:53.180]  And why did he sit on it?
[3:27:53.180 --> 3:27:56.980]  I mean, what if that indictment had been brought in September of 2020 rather than almost a
[3:27:56.980 --> 3:27:57.980]  year later?
[3:27:57.980 --> 3:27:58.980]  You're right.
[3:27:58.980 --> 3:27:59.980]  They still want to stall the election.
[3:27:59.980 --> 3:28:02.940]  Oh, I mean, in all likelihood, but it helped facilitate.
[3:28:02.940 --> 3:28:04.220]  Each level was required.
[3:28:04.220 --> 3:28:05.220]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:28:05.220 --> 3:28:07.260]  I mean, yeah, just the censorship stole the election.
[3:28:07.260 --> 3:28:08.260]  Absolutely.
[3:28:08.260 --> 3:28:09.260]  I mean, just the Hunter Biden story.
[3:28:09.260 --> 3:28:12.780]  If that story had received free and fair coverage, then they lose.
[3:28:12.780 --> 3:28:15.980]  And remember, it wasn't just Democrats working for Hillary at law firms that made it all
[3:28:15.980 --> 3:28:16.980]  up.
[3:28:16.980 --> 3:28:18.380]  It was FBI agents creating fake emails.
[3:28:18.380 --> 3:28:22.700]  Well, you look at it raises an interesting story about Perkins Co, which is the big corporate
[3:28:22.700 --> 3:28:24.940]  law firm that represents the Democrats.
[3:28:24.940 --> 3:28:27.340]  Mark Elias suddenly left about a month and a half ago.
[3:28:27.340 --> 3:28:28.340]  That's right.
[3:28:28.340 --> 3:28:30.340]  He claimed to be doing it because he said he's starting his own firm.
[3:28:30.340 --> 3:28:31.620]  He's doing his own thing.
[3:28:31.620 --> 3:28:34.780]  Now you have to wonder whether it's connected to these subpoenas that have been issued to
[3:28:34.780 --> 3:28:35.780]  the law firm.
[3:28:35.780 --> 3:28:40.020]  What what criminal activity has Mark Elias potentially been involved in on behalf of
[3:28:40.020 --> 3:28:41.380]  the Democratic Party?
[3:28:41.380 --> 3:28:43.940]  So there's a lot of questions that are going to be raised.
[3:28:43.940 --> 3:28:47.180]  And hopefully we at least get some answers because so far those answers next you're going
[3:28:47.180 --> 3:28:48.180]  to tell me have a naughty.
[3:28:48.180 --> 3:28:49.180]  He's not a good guy.
[3:28:49.180 --> 3:28:52.060]  We'll be right back with Robert Barnes.
[3:28:52.060 --> 3:28:53.060]  Stay with us.
[3:28:53.060 --> 3:28:54.060]  What a hell of a ton of the line.
[3:28:54.060 --> 3:28:55.060]  Got a bunch of news.
[3:28:55.060 --> 3:28:56.060]  We haven't hit yet.
[3:28:56.060 --> 3:28:58.060]  Stay with us.
[3:28:58.060 --> 3:29:03.060]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:29:03.060 --> 3:29:09.300]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support
[3:29:09.300 --> 3:29:13.580]  and for word of mouth and then we're all this together and you know, it gets old having
[3:29:13.580 --> 3:29:17.260]  to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:29:17.260 --> 3:29:20.700]  But it's true for the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty
[3:29:20.700 --> 3:29:25.340]  at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and
[3:29:25.340 --> 3:29:26.580]  almost shut down everybody else.
[3:29:26.580 --> 3:29:30.900]  They crippled all the other groups and we're still here and as this whole new world order
[3:29:30.900 --> 3:29:33.780]  comes out and we open, our credibility is going up.
[3:29:33.780 --> 3:29:35.340]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:29:35.340 --> 3:29:37.420]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:29:37.420 --> 3:29:41.820]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi free.
[3:29:41.820 --> 3:29:45.740]  You can't have info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's
[3:29:45.740 --> 3:29:46.740]  about to unfold.
[3:29:46.740 --> 3:29:49.060]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:29:49.060 --> 3:29:54.140]  So thank you all and get an infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements
[3:29:54.140 --> 3:29:55.140]  and so much more.
[3:29:55.140 --> 3:29:58.420]  They're wonderful products and they support the info we're thank you.
[3:29:58.420 --> 3:30:00.180]  I got some goodness.

[3:30:06.340 --> 3:30:09.700]  The bad news is a lot of them are about to sell out.

[3:30:24.900 --> 3:30:28.940]  as knockout, probably too strong for some people, totally different formula, down and
[3:30:28.940 --> 3:30:31.180]  out is back in stock, 50% off.
[3:30:31.180 --> 3:30:36.220]  We've extended the sale on winter sun and ultra 12, 50% off and also on deep breath
[3:30:36.220 --> 3:30:38.500]  crystal iodine survival selects too.

[3:30:42.020 --> 3:30:46.700]  Take advantage of it and find the info war and I thank you all for your support infowarstore.com
[3:30:46.700 --> 3:30:50.540]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[3:30:50.540 --> 3:30:51.540]  It's a win-win.
[3:30:51.540 --> 3:30:55.460]  These are things that make you healthy, make your life better and they find the info war
[3:30:55.460 --> 3:30:58.420]  again only we lose is if you don't take action right now.
[3:30:58.420 --> 3:31:05.220]  In late August, info war saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[3:31:05.220 --> 3:31:11.580]  that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[3:31:11.580 --> 3:31:14.700]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[3:31:14.700 --> 3:31:17.860]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storeable food has always been something that's important to
[3:31:17.860 --> 3:31:18.860]  have.
[3:31:18.860 --> 3:31:23.460]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of right along with water filtration,
[3:31:23.460 --> 3:31:25.740]  self-defense and a relationship with God.
[3:31:25.740 --> 3:31:29.100]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storeable food orders in.
[3:31:29.100 --> 3:31:32.540]  Now we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[3:31:32.540 --> 3:31:33.540]  It's high quality.
[3:31:33.540 --> 3:31:38.260]  It's very, very low cost at infowarstore.com because in the future, you're going to see
[3:31:38.260 --> 3:31:42.580]  more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are
[3:31:42.580 --> 3:31:43.900]  already taking place.
[3:31:43.900 --> 3:31:50.180]  So lock in your storeable food now at a lower price and fund the info war at infowarstore.com.
[3:31:50.180 --> 3:31:54.820]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[3:31:54.820 --> 3:31:58.620]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[3:31:58.620 --> 3:32:05.260]  So the placebo that they have used that the FDA has allowed them to use has often been
[3:32:05.260 --> 3:32:10.820]  another vaccine, a vaccine with a known adverse reaction profile that's causing death and
[3:32:10.820 --> 3:32:13.180]  damage in its own right.
[3:32:13.180 --> 3:32:20.380]  That it's the aluminum as an adjuvant in the vaccine, a known neurotoxin, a known immunotoxin,
[3:32:20.380 --> 3:32:26.900]  a known poison in human beings that is in the supposedly inert placebo, totally inappropriate.
[3:32:26.900 --> 3:32:28.700]  This is not good science.
[3:32:28.700 --> 3:32:31.180]  It is not science at all.
[3:32:31.180 --> 3:32:36.380]  It is an effort to cover up the true adverse reaction rates to these vaccines so that they
[3:32:36.380 --> 3:32:43.300]  can get through the low barrier of constraints put there by the FDA and onto the market.
[3:32:43.300 --> 3:32:44.300]  That is the only concern.
[3:32:44.300 --> 3:32:49.620]  Dr. Wakefield is just one of many informed voices in the film, COVIDland.
[3:32:49.620 --> 3:32:54.860]  Read your copy of COVIDland today at covidland.com and if you order by October 6, you get a free
[3:32:54.860 --> 3:33:01.780]  copy of the film, blueprint for global enslavement, absolutely free.
[3:33:01.780 --> 3:33:25.380]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:25.380 --> 3:33:30.260]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[3:33:30.260 --> 3:33:34.620]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:33:34.620 --> 3:33:35.620]  And we are back.
[3:33:35.620 --> 3:33:37.140]  Boy, we got some breaking news here.
[3:33:37.140 --> 3:33:38.140]  Shock.
[3:33:38.140 --> 3:33:39.300]  It's up on infowords.com.
[3:33:39.300 --> 3:33:40.300]  Just happened.
[3:33:40.300 --> 3:33:44.260]  Vaccine passport passes in Wales after dodgy vote.
[3:33:44.260 --> 3:33:45.260]  They're ramming it through, folks.
[3:33:45.260 --> 3:33:49.060]  Told you they wouldn't do it and they snuck a vote through.
[3:33:49.060 --> 3:33:51.900]  Vaccinated Vermont, 75% of September COVID deaths were jabbed.
[3:33:51.900 --> 3:33:54.260]  We've got some incredible graphs I'm going to show you.
[3:33:54.260 --> 3:33:57.500]  We got calls, final segment, Robert Barnes riding a shotgun with me.
[3:33:57.500 --> 3:33:59.620]  We're going to go to Nathan and others here coming up.
[3:33:59.620 --> 3:34:07.700]  I wanted to get Arthur Poloski on streetsearch, streetchurch.ca, he's been arrested multiple
[3:34:07.700 --> 3:34:13.980]  times for keeping his church open when everything else like the grocery store should stay open.
[3:34:13.980 --> 3:34:14.980]  Just he can.
[3:34:14.980 --> 3:34:20.820]  So this is happening in the U.S., it's happening around the world, it's absolute tyranny and
[3:34:20.820 --> 3:34:23.900]  he is set for sentencing, I guess, for one of the arrests.
[3:34:23.900 --> 3:34:29.580]  He just got arrested a week ago or so flying back in from a U.S. event with the general
[3:34:29.580 --> 3:34:35.020]  Flynn was that they were waiting for him at the airport for the thought crime of contempt.
[3:34:35.020 --> 3:34:39.060]  So you have contempt of the evil government that doesn't want you to have your right to
[3:34:39.060 --> 3:34:43.060]  religion and right to exercise it there for Arthur Poloski.
[3:34:43.060 --> 3:34:45.140]  Thanks for joining us, sir.
[3:34:45.140 --> 3:34:46.700]  Thank you so much for having me in.
[3:34:46.700 --> 3:34:52.940]  I mean, it's total craziness, tyranny like I have never seen before, even growing up
[3:34:52.940 --> 3:34:54.300]  behind the iron curtain.
[3:34:54.300 --> 3:35:00.140]  I mean, the communists, the socialists, what at least admit that's what we want.
[3:35:00.140 --> 3:35:04.380]  We are tyrants and we are taking it over, but here you have a hybrid.
[3:35:04.380 --> 3:35:09.620]  You got lying, manipulating politicians that pretends that everything they're doing is
[3:35:09.620 --> 3:35:15.820]  under the scrutiny of the law, however, it's total lawlessness.
[3:35:15.820 --> 3:35:19.780]  Tell us what's happened to you, sir, and tell us just your overall view of the world and
[3:35:19.780 --> 3:35:22.300]  the persecution of the church.
[3:35:22.300 --> 3:35:27.700]  Well, I have been warning people since 2005 that this is going to happen unless the people
[3:35:27.700 --> 3:35:29.540]  will rise up, stand up.
[3:35:29.540 --> 3:35:34.860]  If the church is going to continue playing a game of self-centeredness and, you know,
[3:35:34.860 --> 3:35:37.180]  lukewarmness, then that's what's going to happen.
[3:35:37.180 --> 3:35:41.140]  God is going to start shaking the hell out, and that's exactly what we're seeing right
[3:35:41.140 --> 3:35:42.140]  now.
[3:35:42.140 --> 3:35:46.900]  And then my answer to the problem is always the same has always been the same and it's
[3:35:46.900 --> 3:35:48.780]  going to be the same tomorrow.
[3:35:48.780 --> 3:35:49.780]  Rise up, stand up.
[3:35:49.780 --> 3:35:54.340]  Take it to the streets, round the houses of those politicians, demand your rights back.
[3:35:54.340 --> 3:35:58.700]  They are never, ever going to give it back to you, your freedoms.
[3:35:58.700 --> 3:36:00.820]  You have to demand those freedoms.
[3:36:00.820 --> 3:36:02.900]  You have to take it from their throat.
[3:36:02.900 --> 3:36:09.140]  They will never, ever are going to give them back to you unless you rise up and stand up.
[3:36:09.140 --> 3:36:10.140]  Petitions do not work.
[3:36:10.140 --> 3:36:11.820]  Conquers do not work anymore.
[3:36:11.820 --> 3:36:17.680]  The only thing that will work is putting pressure on those corrupted evil wannabe tyrants.
[3:36:17.680 --> 3:36:20.460]  We have to bring Nuremberg trial number two.
[3:36:20.460 --> 3:36:24.660]  We have to get them accountable, charge them for treason, for murdering people because
[3:36:24.660 --> 3:36:26.740]  that's exactly what they're doing right now.
[3:36:26.740 --> 3:36:29.260]  They are bloody mortars and they will not stop.
[3:36:29.260 --> 3:36:30.260]  Evil never stops.
[3:36:30.260 --> 3:36:34.580]  Bully will keep bullying until you and me will say no more.
[3:36:34.580 --> 3:36:35.580]  That's right.
[3:36:35.580 --> 3:36:37.700]  This is the UN-directed world depopulation now.
[3:36:37.700 --> 3:36:39.060]  It's even in the Pentagon's own report.
[3:36:39.060 --> 3:36:42.740]  So tell people, and Robert Barnes, the lawyer here, he goes to show the prominent lawyer
[3:36:42.740 --> 3:36:47.660]  in Canada why they're persecuting you, how they've closed other churches, put fences
[3:36:47.660 --> 3:36:48.660]  up around them.
[3:36:48.660 --> 3:36:50.740]  People tried to dare go in them, but everything else is open.
[3:36:50.740 --> 3:36:54.060]  I mean, this is just unbelievable criminal activity.
[3:36:54.060 --> 3:36:57.020]  Yes, it is.
[3:36:57.020 --> 3:37:00.380]  And the hypocrisy, the level of hypocrisy is unbelievable.
[3:37:00.380 --> 3:37:06.140]  I was charged with my brother, David, for inciting people to come to church, officiating
[3:37:06.140 --> 3:37:09.300]  a church service, participating in illegal gathering.
[3:37:09.300 --> 3:37:14.820]  And we have been found guilty on two accounts facing potentially four years' prison for
[3:37:14.820 --> 3:37:16.380]  that crime.
[3:37:16.380 --> 3:37:23.180]  At the same time, Jason Kenney, the premier of Alberta, with a minister of finance, chiefs,
[3:37:23.180 --> 3:37:28.660]  with a minister of environment, Nixon, and a minister of health that sent those wannabe
[3:37:28.660 --> 3:37:32.580]  Gestapo KGB agents to hunt us down.
[3:37:32.580 --> 3:37:36.340]  They broke the same rules, the same court injunction.
[3:37:36.340 --> 3:37:37.900]  And do you think they get tickets?
[3:37:37.900 --> 3:37:39.780]  Do you think they're in front of the courts now?
[3:37:39.780 --> 3:37:42.500]  It's one law for me and one law for them.
[3:37:42.500 --> 3:37:47.220]  Those people are showing left and right that they have total disregard to the law and order
[3:37:47.220 --> 3:37:52.260]  of the land, charter of rights and freedoms, out the door, constitution, out the door.
[3:37:52.260 --> 3:37:56.780]  They are the tyrants, wannabe faras, and the rest are the slaves.
[3:37:56.780 --> 3:38:02.500]  And so, pastor, hypothetically, potentially, next week you could start serving a four-year
[3:38:02.500 --> 3:38:08.620]  prison sentence in the northern gulag that's north of the United States right now for keeping
[3:38:08.620 --> 3:38:13.180]  your church open and serving and feeding meals to your community while everything else, topless
[3:38:13.180 --> 3:38:20.300]  bars, grocery stores, Walmart, they could be open and you're faced with four years in
[3:38:20.300 --> 3:38:23.580]  jail for contempt by having church.
[3:38:23.580 --> 3:38:26.060]  I mean, this is like communist China.
[3:38:26.060 --> 3:38:30.940]  I mean, my God, they send the Uighurs for having their mosque church for five years
[3:38:30.940 --> 3:38:32.260]  to a labor camp.
[3:38:32.260 --> 3:38:33.780]  Robert Barnes, though, this is incredible.
[3:38:33.780 --> 3:38:35.380]  Yeah, no doubt about that.
[3:38:35.380 --> 3:38:39.260]  I mean, I guess today, the premier in Alberta said that the unvaccinated won't be allowed
[3:38:39.260 --> 3:38:41.300]  to even have Thanksgiving.
[3:38:41.300 --> 3:38:45.820]  So can you, I mean, in terms of what have you been able to do in terms of legal defense,
[3:38:45.820 --> 3:38:47.300]  because one concern in Canada has been...
[3:38:47.300 --> 3:38:49.300]  I know they said, unvaccinated cannot have people to their homes.
[3:38:49.300 --> 3:38:50.300]  That's exactly...
[3:38:50.300 --> 3:38:51.300]  And they're gonna go put you in jail too.
[3:38:51.300 --> 3:38:53.300]  I mean, this is, these people are flaming criminals.
[3:38:53.300 --> 3:38:54.300]  Sorry.
[3:38:54.300 --> 3:38:57.780]  Arthur, go ahead and tell us what's happening there.
[3:38:57.780 --> 3:39:00.260]  Well, there's more to the story.
[3:39:00.260 --> 3:39:02.820]  The prime minister is a wannabe tyrant.
[3:39:02.820 --> 3:39:10.180]  I mean, now, full-blown tyrant, he just announced that you will not be able to use bus, cop,
[3:39:10.180 --> 3:39:11.180]  rail.
[3:39:11.180 --> 3:39:15.460]  You will not be able to fly outside of the country if you don't have the vaccination.
[3:39:15.460 --> 3:39:20.260]  So a total lockdown, just like in North Korea, I mean, there is no difference between North
[3:39:20.260 --> 3:39:22.300]  Korea right now and Canada.
[3:39:22.300 --> 3:39:23.540]  They can do whatever they want.
[3:39:23.540 --> 3:39:24.540]  There is lawlessness.
[3:39:24.540 --> 3:39:26.820]  There is no rule of law anymore.
[3:39:26.820 --> 3:39:28.100]  The judges are corrupted.
[3:39:28.100 --> 3:39:30.140]  The court systems are corrupted.
[3:39:30.140 --> 3:39:34.420]  I know who officiated the court proceedings.
[3:39:34.420 --> 3:39:39.420]  For me, it was a personal friend to the judge that issued the court order.
[3:39:39.420 --> 3:39:42.060]  We never stood a chance with my brother, David.
[3:39:42.060 --> 3:39:46.940]  We were charged and sentenced before even the trial started.
[3:39:46.940 --> 3:39:47.940]  We never had a chance.
[3:39:47.940 --> 3:39:53.700]  We have four lawyers, constitutional lawyer, criminal lawyers, and they are just shaking
[3:39:53.700 --> 3:39:54.700]  their heads because the judge...
[3:39:54.700 --> 3:39:57.180]  Well, they just got rid of my jury trial here in the U.S. They've arrested Owen.
[3:39:57.180 --> 3:40:00.860]  He's facing two years in jail for peacefully Owen Schreuer, for peacefully being at the
[3:40:00.860 --> 3:40:01.860]  Capitol.
[3:40:01.860 --> 3:40:02.860]  I mean, this is the system.
[3:40:02.860 --> 3:40:03.860]  They built the gulags.
[3:40:03.860 --> 3:40:04.860]  They're coming for us.
[3:40:04.860 --> 3:40:07.340]  So what can we do, Pastor, for you and your great church?
[3:40:07.340 --> 3:40:10.860]  I mean, I guess when you're in jail, if that happens, I guess it's probably going to happen.
[3:40:10.860 --> 3:40:12.420]  I guess the next preacher does it.
[3:40:12.420 --> 3:40:13.420]  They'll arrest him too.
[3:40:13.420 --> 3:40:17.180]  My God, Canada just cries out to be saved.
[3:40:17.180 --> 3:40:18.900]  I mean, like it's Nazi Germany.
[3:40:18.900 --> 3:40:21.740]  Do we have to have a D-Day invasion?
[3:40:21.740 --> 3:40:22.740]  I guess we have to.
[3:40:22.740 --> 3:40:27.060]  I mean, if Americans will not come to our rescue, you still are the power horse.
[3:40:27.060 --> 3:40:29.180]  The freedom, the liberties around the world.
[3:40:29.180 --> 3:40:33.900]  If America will fall, the rest of the free democratic world will follow.
[3:40:33.900 --> 3:40:38.220]  I mean, we don't stand a chance unless Americans will come to the rescue.
[3:40:38.220 --> 3:40:39.220]  And you're right.
[3:40:39.220 --> 3:40:40.220]  We need another D-Day.
[3:40:40.220 --> 3:40:41.820]  There is no other way.
[3:40:41.820 --> 3:40:43.980]  Those people are not stopping every month.
[3:40:43.980 --> 3:40:46.820]  There is another thing that they're implementing and pushing.
[3:40:46.820 --> 3:40:47.820]  So what people can do?
[3:40:47.820 --> 3:40:54.260]  Well, you can come to our website, www.streetjust.ca, and you can help us.
[3:40:54.260 --> 3:41:00.260]  If I'm going to prison, at least for my family to be sustained, also, you can put a political
[3:41:00.260 --> 3:41:01.260]  pressure.
[3:41:01.260 --> 3:41:04.380]  There still are afraid of the American politicians.
[3:41:04.380 --> 3:41:05.380]  If we can find some...
[3:41:05.380 --> 3:41:09.100]  Paul, we need demonstrations against what's happening in Canada and Australia.
[3:41:09.100 --> 3:41:11.500]  I mean, because the Democrats admit this is coming here.
[3:41:11.500 --> 3:41:12.500]  This is you, Indirected.
[3:41:12.500 --> 3:41:15.860]  So, folks, this is like having our arm being chewed off.
[3:41:15.860 --> 3:41:16.860]  They're coming for our heart.
[3:41:16.860 --> 3:41:21.140]  I mean, people in Texas and South Dakota and Florida, you better not feel safe.
[3:41:21.140 --> 3:41:22.140]  This is a global plan.
[3:41:22.140 --> 3:41:23.140]  No doubt.
[3:41:23.140 --> 3:41:26.940]  If you look at the attack on religious accommodations for vaccine objections in the United States,
[3:41:26.940 --> 3:41:30.220]  it's part of the same parcel of what the pastor is talking about.
[3:41:30.220 --> 3:41:35.300]  It's this constant continuous attack on people who hold beliefs they don't want to have held.
[3:41:35.300 --> 3:41:39.420]  And it's part of the lockdown as a pretext to attack the church and to attack religion
[3:41:39.420 --> 3:41:43.260]  and to attack people who have religious beliefs that are different than the establishment.
[3:41:43.260 --> 3:41:47.260]  And his example is just one of the more extreme examples, but it's where the whole world is
[3:41:47.260 --> 3:41:49.740]  going unless people stand up and fight.
[3:41:49.740 --> 3:41:53.300]  Even on top of it, it's experimental, and it's killing a bunch of people, confirmed,
[3:41:53.300 --> 3:41:56.300]  and Fauci cooked it up in a lab and then released it on purpose.
[3:41:56.300 --> 3:41:57.300]  And there's video of it.
[3:41:57.300 --> 3:41:58.660]  I mean, this is war.
[3:41:58.660 --> 3:42:02.540]  They know they can't assault us straight up, so they're doing it with soft-kill weapons.
[3:42:02.540 --> 3:42:05.900]  Arthur, I didn't know you were facing jail in just a few days.
[3:42:05.900 --> 3:42:07.580]  Let that sink in.
[3:42:07.580 --> 3:42:10.060]  Please join us again tomorrow when we've got more time.
[3:42:10.060 --> 3:42:13.700]  I want to get you on the other shows, and people should go and support your church,
[3:42:13.700 --> 3:42:17.460]  and they should pray for your church, and they should donate to your church, streetchurch.ca,
[3:42:17.460 --> 3:42:23.420]  YouTube, arthurpaloski.tv, or paloski, P-A-W-L-O-W-S-K-I.
[3:42:23.420 --> 3:42:24.660]  God bless you, sir.
[3:42:24.660 --> 3:42:26.500]  Give your mission to Africa, Europe, the Caribbean.
[3:42:26.500 --> 3:42:30.140]  Also passes a church inside a building called the Cave of Adulam.
[3:42:30.140 --> 3:42:35.660]  Thank you, and again, come on tomorrow with us before I guess you're sent into the dungeon.
[3:42:35.660 --> 3:42:38.500]  But Paul wrote, you know, the New Testament in the dungeon, so that's the way it is, but
[3:42:38.500 --> 3:42:40.660]  my God, he's in the dungeon this week.
[3:42:40.660 --> 3:42:42.460]  We're in the dungeon next month.
[3:42:42.460 --> 3:42:43.460]  God bless you, Pastor.
[3:42:43.460 --> 3:42:44.460]  We'll talk to you soon.
[3:42:44.460 --> 3:42:45.460]  We'll talk to you tomorrow, okay?
[3:42:45.460 --> 3:42:46.460]  Thank you.
[3:42:46.460 --> 3:42:47.460]  God bless you.
[3:42:47.460 --> 3:42:48.460]  All right.
[3:42:48.460 --> 3:42:50.460]  I want to get him on, like, 30 minutes of the show tomorrow, right at the start.
[3:42:50.460 --> 3:42:51.460]  This is a big deal.
[3:42:51.460 --> 3:42:54.660]  We're going to come back and jam in these calls for Robert Barnes and myself in the final
[3:42:54.660 --> 3:42:55.660]  segment straight ahead.
[3:42:55.660 --> 3:42:56.660]  And the war room starts.
[3:42:56.660 --> 3:42:57.660]  He'll be on the first hour there.
[3:42:57.660 --> 3:43:01.580]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful
[3:43:01.580 --> 3:43:04.180]  products ever made, Alpha Power.
[3:43:04.180 --> 3:43:07.660]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.

[3:43:11.980 --> 3:43:16.700]  assist in restoring that lost energy and mood that comes with time and age.

[3:43:35.740 --> 3:43:38.020]  healthy cholesterol, and more.

[3:43:41.780 --> 3:43:44.220]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny.
[3:43:44.220 --> 3:43:48.860]  Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today with Alpha Power.
[3:43:48.860 --> 3:43:57.340]  Head to InfowarsStore.com today.
[3:43:57.340 --> 3:44:02.020]  People ask me, Alex, why did you come out with a new natural organic sleep aid when
[3:44:02.020 --> 3:44:06.020]  you already have knockout that works so well with eight natural ingredients?
[3:44:06.020 --> 3:44:10.820]  Well, because when you've taken a certain organic blend for a decade, like I've taken
[3:44:10.820 --> 3:44:13.980]  this product I came up with, it doesn't work as well anymore.
[3:44:13.980 --> 3:44:14.980]  That's the way herbs work.
[3:44:14.980 --> 3:44:16.540]  Do you go off it a while?
[3:44:16.540 --> 3:44:17.540]  Come back on it.
[3:44:17.540 --> 3:44:18.540]  It works again.
[3:44:18.540 --> 3:44:19.540]  So what did I do?
[3:44:19.540 --> 3:44:22.780]  I went to the developers and I said, make a totally different formula with a lot of other
[3:44:22.780 --> 3:44:26.500]  known natural healthy compounds that make you sleep deep and restful because that's what
[3:44:26.500 --> 3:44:30.900]  helps your immune system, and I want it to be at least twice as strong as knockout.
[3:44:30.900 --> 3:44:33.100]  Okay, be careful when you take it.
[3:44:33.100 --> 3:44:34.420]  It's incredibly strong.
[3:44:34.420 --> 3:44:35.420]  It's named down and out.
[3:44:35.420 --> 3:44:39.380]  I don't have time to get into all the ingredients in it, but it is extremely strong and we are
[3:44:39.380 --> 3:44:40.820]  extremely proud of it.
[3:44:40.820 --> 3:44:47.340]  It is exclusively available at infowarstore.com, 50% off right now, sold out for more than
[3:44:47.340 --> 3:44:48.340]  four months.
[3:44:48.340 --> 3:44:53.100]  Now back at stock, get your down and out and your knockout at infowarstore.com today.
[3:44:53.100 --> 3:44:58.180]  I thank you for your support because it keeps us on the air.
[3:44:58.180 --> 3:45:02.980]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[3:45:02.980 --> 3:45:05.020]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[3:45:05.020 --> 3:45:10.700]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational,
[3:45:10.700 --> 3:45:11.700]  but we failed.
[3:45:11.700 --> 3:45:13.180]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[3:45:13.180 --> 3:45:18.940]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[3:45:18.940 --> 3:45:21.300]  deindustrialization, great reset.
[3:45:21.300 --> 3:45:25.620]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[3:45:25.620 --> 3:45:30.220]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[3:45:30.220 --> 3:45:33.540]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda, and we've
[3:45:33.540 --> 3:45:37.340]  also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one things to do is high quality
[3:45:37.340 --> 3:45:38.340]  storeable food.
[3:45:38.340 --> 3:45:43.060]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[3:45:43.060 --> 3:45:47.100]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[3:45:47.100 --> 3:45:48.420]  to ship right now.
[3:45:48.420 --> 3:45:53.420]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits
[3:45:53.420 --> 3:45:55.900]  because believe me, serious times are coming.
[3:45:55.900 --> 3:45:59.940]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[3:45:59.940 --> 3:46:03.820]  I want to explain something that is absolutely key to understanding our world.
[3:46:03.820 --> 3:46:08.740]  It's very, very simple, but the most people don't know the privately owned central banks
[3:46:08.740 --> 3:46:16.260]  of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies
[3:46:16.260 --> 3:46:23.260]  and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual property, energy.
[3:46:23.260 --> 3:46:28.260]  They're using it to buy people, to buy influence, and in the past, they created thousands of
[3:46:28.260 --> 3:46:32.300]  trillions so that they could leverage that, manipulate markets, but they never allowed
[3:46:32.300 --> 3:46:37.340]  that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[3:46:37.340 --> 3:46:41.940]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy,
[3:46:41.940 --> 3:46:47.820]  buying up everything, not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and
[3:46:47.820 --> 3:46:52.340]  force a collapse of civilization, making the companies they do fund be the only things
[3:46:52.340 --> 3:46:53.340]  left standing.
[3:46:53.340 --> 3:46:54.340]  This is the Great Reset.
[3:46:54.340 --> 3:46:55.340]  This is what's happening now.
[3:46:55.340 --> 3:46:56.340]  Warn everyone.
[3:46:56.340 --> 3:47:01.180]  It's the only way to stop it.
[3:47:01.180 --> 3:47:06.340]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:06.340 --> 3:47:19.660]  They knew what they were doing.
[3:47:19.660 --> 3:47:21.940]  This was a takeover.
[3:47:21.940 --> 3:47:24.980]  Imagine what I told you two years ago.
[3:47:24.980 --> 3:47:30.500]  They'll be locking preachers up in jail for four-year sentences in Canada because Walmart
[3:47:30.500 --> 3:47:34.940]  was open, the grocery stores were open, and the auto parts stores were open, but their
[3:47:34.940 --> 3:47:40.060]  churches still aren't allowed to be open because they're nice people in Canada and
[3:47:40.060 --> 3:47:41.700]  the system is making a move on them.
[3:47:41.700 --> 3:47:42.700]  Same thing in Australia.
[3:47:42.700 --> 3:47:47.380]  They're not pulling that in areas of the Midwest and Texas because they know it would
[3:47:47.380 --> 3:47:49.660]  work, but the Democrat city's just as bad.
[3:47:49.660 --> 3:47:51.220]  I'll take a few final calls here.
[3:47:51.220 --> 3:47:53.100]  You're about to take a 15-minute break.
[3:47:53.100 --> 3:47:57.580]  We'll be on 15 minutes into the war with a lot of news you've got to cover, but Barnes,
[3:47:57.580 --> 3:47:59.780]  I know you're here in Texas working on some big cases.
[3:47:59.780 --> 3:48:02.780]  You can't see what it is, but it's going to be big.
[3:48:02.780 --> 3:48:04.180]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:48:04.180 --> 3:48:08.380]  What's happening is extraordinary, and what Project Veritas is doing is very important,
[3:48:08.380 --> 3:48:10.100]  and people are starting to put the dots together.
[3:48:10.100 --> 3:48:13.660]  You see what Project Veritas has been able to show in Uncover Reporting.
[3:48:13.660 --> 3:48:16.300]  You look at all these high-level resignations.
[3:48:16.300 --> 3:48:21.660]  Why is it we have two of the top FDA people, one of the top NIH people all retire now, resigned
[3:48:21.660 --> 3:48:23.180]  from office now.
[3:48:23.180 --> 3:48:25.340]  You look at interesting TV shows that are happening right now.
[3:48:25.340 --> 3:48:29.940]  The show Goliath had a great breakdown of what the big farm industry is really like
[3:48:29.940 --> 3:48:32.500]  in the beginning of their X-ray episode.
[3:48:32.500 --> 3:48:36.020]  You're seeing cultural recognition, political recognition that something very unusual is
[3:48:36.020 --> 3:48:37.020]  taking place.
[3:48:37.020 --> 3:48:38.020]  Yeah.
[3:48:38.020 --> 3:48:40.540]  I mean, they skipped the trial so they'd already studied other vaccines.
[3:48:40.540 --> 3:48:41.540]  They knew what would happen.
[3:48:41.540 --> 3:48:42.540]  They covered up what happened.
[3:48:42.540 --> 3:48:43.540]  Exactly.
[3:48:43.540 --> 3:48:46.580]  I think we're going to find more and more evidence that everything that's gone into
[3:48:46.580 --> 3:48:50.780]  this process was not a scientific method, and we're starting to see more and more reports
[3:48:50.780 --> 3:48:55.460]  of problems related to the vaccine, seeing more and more people pushed back, and that's
[3:48:55.460 --> 3:48:59.700]  why we're getting this oppressive reaction from the state and the institutions.
[3:48:59.700 --> 3:49:03.380]  Why were they so reckless to execute this, because we knew they're playing day one.
[3:49:03.380 --> 3:49:05.220]  We already read it in Operation Lockstep.
[3:49:05.220 --> 3:49:08.260]  Why would they, I guess, because they're scared of populism, and this was a desperate
[3:49:08.260 --> 3:49:09.260]  elite move?
[3:49:09.260 --> 3:49:10.260]  Absolutely.
[3:49:10.260 --> 3:49:12.940]  I mean, think about all the shenanigans they had to pull to pull off Biden getting in the
[3:49:12.940 --> 3:49:15.820]  White House, and they still barely got it.
[3:49:15.820 --> 3:49:19.860]  I mean, they had to have massive censorship of unprecedented degree.
[3:49:19.860 --> 3:49:23.500]  They'd have massive propaganda of unprecedented degree in America.
[3:49:23.500 --> 3:49:27.340]  They had to have an extraordinary degree of election irregularities or anomalies, whatever
[3:49:27.340 --> 3:49:28.420]  you want to call them.
[3:49:28.420 --> 3:49:32.580]  They had to accumulate all of that, and yet they still could barely win within the margin
[3:49:32.580 --> 3:49:33.580]  of fraud.
[3:49:33.580 --> 3:49:37.780]  And now they're running propaganda corporate news wide bulletins that Bill Gates loves
[3:49:37.780 --> 3:49:39.620]  you and doesn't want to depopulate you.
[3:49:39.620 --> 3:49:42.380]  That's because their whole agenda is coming out, and people know they're liars, so now
[3:49:42.380 --> 3:49:45.740]  people that never even thought that now know it's true, because whatever the system says,
[3:49:45.740 --> 3:49:46.740]  it's the opposite.
[3:49:46.740 --> 3:49:49.140]  Well, just look at the data you're talking about from Vermont, the most vaccinated
[3:49:49.140 --> 3:49:52.260]  state in the United States is having an explosion of COVID.
[3:49:52.260 --> 3:49:57.220]  How is that possible if the vaccination was supposed to reduce the presence of COVID, was
[3:49:57.220 --> 3:50:01.780]  supposed to prevent infection and transmission, was supposed to be the solution, and yet the
[3:50:01.780 --> 3:50:05.980]  most vaccinated state in the union is having one of the biggest problems with COVID right
[3:50:05.980 --> 3:50:06.980]  now.
[3:50:06.980 --> 3:50:07.980]  And you're on fire right now.
[3:50:07.980 --> 3:50:10.420]  And in about 20 minutes, you'll be on with Elwin Shroy.
[3:50:10.420 --> 3:50:11.860]  You're on the show within 15 minutes.
[3:50:11.860 --> 3:50:14.900]  I want to jam in some calls that I promised to, but you guys are awesome.
[3:50:14.900 --> 3:50:15.900]  Thanks for holding.
[3:50:15.900 --> 3:50:16.900]  Just tell us your story.
[3:50:16.900 --> 3:50:17.900]  I'll move to the next part as everybody gets in.
[3:50:17.900 --> 3:50:20.980]  Nathan, once you talk about what happened to his mom with COVID, and what happened with
[3:50:20.980 --> 3:50:21.980]  you yesterday.
[3:50:21.980 --> 3:50:22.980]  Nathan.
[3:50:22.980 --> 3:50:23.980]  Yes.
[3:50:23.980 --> 3:50:24.980]  Hello, Alex.
[3:50:24.980 --> 3:50:26.700]  Thank you for taking my call.
[3:50:26.700 --> 3:50:27.700]  Just quick plug.
[3:50:27.700 --> 3:50:28.700]  X2.
[3:50:28.700 --> 3:50:29.700]  Everything's great.
[3:50:29.700 --> 3:50:30.700]  Mineral fusion.
[3:50:30.700 --> 3:50:31.700]  Fizzy magnesium.
[3:50:31.700 --> 3:50:32.700]  I love it all.
[3:50:32.700 --> 3:50:33.700]  Buy everything.
[3:50:33.700 --> 3:50:34.700]  Keep buying products.
[3:50:34.700 --> 3:50:36.260]  Keep in for wars on air.
[3:50:36.260 --> 3:50:37.260]  Thank you.
[3:50:37.260 --> 3:50:41.220]  Last Friday, my mother had got sick.
[3:50:41.220 --> 3:50:42.460]  She's very stubborn.
[3:50:42.460 --> 3:50:45.020]  Tuesday, she started feeling really bad.
[3:50:45.020 --> 3:50:46.020]  Didn't let me know.
[3:50:46.020 --> 3:50:48.620]  She says, Mom, do you think you got COVID?
[3:50:48.620 --> 3:50:49.620]  She says, I don't know.
[3:50:49.620 --> 3:50:53.540]  She went and got one of those quick tests from the pharmacy.
[3:50:53.540 --> 3:50:54.980]  They came back positive.
[3:50:54.980 --> 3:51:01.380]  She called her doctor, and her doctor said, she asked, and I said, well, ask them if they
[3:51:01.380 --> 3:51:06.100]  do any early treatments, what they do, and they do monoconal antibodies.
[3:51:06.100 --> 3:51:12.860]  They do the Regeneron in Michigan, but they said, you have to have it within 10 days.
[3:51:12.860 --> 3:51:15.020]  This is four days into it.
[3:51:15.020 --> 3:51:19.660]  They waited two days to give her a PCR test, so she couldn't get it.
[3:51:19.660 --> 3:51:24.300]  My wife got on the internet, searched, and searched, and searched, and actually I talked
[3:51:24.300 --> 3:51:25.860]  with Rob Doo.
[3:51:25.860 --> 3:51:27.660]  He sent me synergy.
[3:51:27.660 --> 3:51:28.780]  It was a little bit high.
[3:51:28.780 --> 3:51:30.620]  We did a little more searching.
[3:51:30.620 --> 3:51:33.220]  I ended up sending the site we went.
[3:51:33.220 --> 3:51:36.060]  We went through BUDesonide words.
[3:51:36.060 --> 3:51:37.380]  They linked us.
[3:51:37.380 --> 3:51:43.900]  We wound up getting a prescription for ivermectin, BUDesonide, and they sent us an antibiotic
[3:51:43.900 --> 3:51:47.660]  for the COVID pneumonia afterward.
[3:51:47.660 --> 3:51:53.820]  My mother asked the doctor, said, well, you guys aren't going to do the Regeneron.
[3:51:53.820 --> 3:51:55.860]  Am I supposed to just die now?
[3:51:55.860 --> 3:51:57.980]  They said, we're really sorry, ma'am.
[3:51:57.980 --> 3:52:00.180]  I've had a hard time not calling that doctor.
[3:52:00.180 --> 3:52:01.620]  That's because they're rationing it.
[3:52:01.620 --> 3:52:03.220]  They have plenty of Regeneron.
[3:52:03.220 --> 3:52:06.860]  What happened to your mom once she got to medicine?
[3:52:06.860 --> 3:52:14.380]  The very next day, she was feeling really brad on last Friday night, and foggy head.
[3:52:14.380 --> 3:52:20.500]  As soon as she took the first pill of ivermectin the next day, she said the fog was gone.
[3:52:20.500 --> 3:52:22.940]  She's still really weak right now.
[3:52:22.940 --> 3:52:27.820]  She's doing one treatment of BUDesonide in the morning, today's her last day of ivermectin.
[3:52:27.820 --> 3:52:29.500]  She's not running a fever.
[3:52:29.500 --> 3:52:34.300]  Her oxygen's staying above 92 right now, so far, so good.
[3:52:34.300 --> 3:52:35.300]  Hopefully we caught it early.
[3:52:35.300 --> 3:52:39.580]  I was told by Bartlett, you want to do at least four of the inhaled steroid treatments
[3:52:39.580 --> 3:52:43.300]  a day, and the reason it used to be really cheap and it's gone up is they're trying
[3:52:43.300 --> 3:52:47.140]  to kill the supply, and so for suppliers to get it, it's gone up.
[3:52:47.140 --> 3:52:49.380]  God bless you, because it said your mom's a lot better.
[3:52:49.380 --> 3:52:50.380]  Is that accurate?
[3:52:50.380 --> 3:52:56.580]  Yes, and it was $300 for an inhaler of BUDesonide.
[3:52:56.580 --> 3:52:57.580]  That's how much it cost.
[3:52:57.580 --> 3:53:00.780]  Well, you're getting, I paid $20 when I was sick a few months ago.
[3:53:00.780 --> 3:53:01.780]  Wow.
[3:53:01.780 --> 3:53:02.780]  God bless you, sir.
[3:53:02.780 --> 3:53:04.540]  These people gouging folks during a crisis are going to be in trouble.
[3:53:04.540 --> 3:53:07.580]  That doesn't mean the reseller's gouging you, but up the chain it's doing it.
[3:53:07.580 --> 3:53:12.580]  One of our guys is up in North Carolina, works for us, a really great Patriot, former Special
[3:53:12.580 --> 3:53:16.980]  Operations guy, and he tried to get an inhaler for him and his family that had it, and they
[3:53:16.980 --> 3:53:20.820]  took him about five days, and then finally they said you can rent it for, I think it
[3:53:20.820 --> 3:53:24.940]  was like $500 a week or something, just a little inhaler that normally costs 50 bucks.
[3:53:24.940 --> 3:53:25.940]  Yeah.
[3:53:25.940 --> 3:53:26.940]  I mean, it's amazing.
[3:53:26.940 --> 3:53:30.140]  I mean, what's extraordinary is that what used to be, it shows a culmination.
[3:53:30.140 --> 3:53:34.100]  All the attacks on alternative health were leading up to this place, because they wanted
[3:53:34.100 --> 3:53:37.100]  to be able to have a state monopoly on what medicine you could get.
[3:53:37.100 --> 3:53:38.100]  And censor everybody.
[3:53:38.100 --> 3:53:39.100]  Absolutely.
[3:53:39.100 --> 3:53:40.100]  So they could control your body.
[3:53:40.100 --> 3:53:43.060]  They get to decide what goes in your body and what doesn't, even though the whole number
[3:53:43.060 --> 3:53:46.980]  code of 1947 was supposed to stop this from ever happening again, we're seeing it happen
[3:53:46.980 --> 3:53:47.980]  again.
[3:53:47.980 --> 3:53:48.980]  And people say, why is it so over the top?
[3:53:48.980 --> 3:53:50.260]  Because they're making a criminal run at us.
[3:53:50.260 --> 3:53:51.260]  They think we're weak.
[3:53:51.260 --> 3:53:53.700]  I think even if they get stopped, at least they get a bunch of slaves that are scared
[3:53:53.700 --> 3:53:54.700]  of their control.
[3:53:54.700 --> 3:53:57.900]  They kill a bunch of people, they make trillions of dollars, and then they never get in trouble.
[3:53:57.900 --> 3:53:58.900]  That's why they did this.
[3:53:58.900 --> 3:53:59.900]  Exactly.
[3:53:59.900 --> 3:54:04.660]  They made a project really centuries in the building of it, and they were scared they
[3:54:04.660 --> 3:54:06.740]  were never going to get an opportunity again to implement it.
[3:54:06.740 --> 3:54:07.740]  So they launched it.
[3:54:07.740 --> 3:54:08.740]  Exactly.
[3:54:08.740 --> 3:54:10.180]  In fact, this was their end game to take us all down.
[3:54:10.180 --> 3:54:11.580]  Now it's just to stay in power.
[3:54:11.580 --> 3:54:12.580]  Absolutely.
[3:54:12.580 --> 3:54:15.300]  And it was necessary in their view because of the rise of populism around the world.
[3:54:15.300 --> 3:54:17.660]  I want you to cover that theme when you're on with Owen.
[3:54:17.660 --> 3:54:18.660]  I'm going to be watching that.
[3:54:18.660 --> 3:54:19.660]  It's so powerful.
[3:54:19.660 --> 3:54:23.380]  You're going to be on with me tomorrow night, 7 to 10.
[3:54:23.380 --> 3:54:26.260]  We're going to air the two hour film, but Barnes will be with me, the director, the
[3:54:26.260 --> 3:54:30.900]  producer of the new film, COVID land, we're going to air it for free at band.video and
[3:54:30.900 --> 3:54:33.300]  freeworldnews.tv at 7 p.m. Share it.
[3:54:33.300 --> 3:54:37.700]  Be part of the giant chain reaction so millions see it and all of you help finance it again.
[3:54:37.700 --> 3:54:40.900]  And then the next version is we're going to put up two, three, four and five by buying
[3:54:40.900 --> 3:54:41.900]  the DVD to make copies.
[3:54:41.900 --> 3:54:42.900]  They have a hard copy.
[3:54:42.900 --> 3:54:46.260]  They can't censor, but you can download a copy from band.video tomorrow as well.
[3:54:46.260 --> 3:54:47.260]  So we thank the filmmakers.
[3:54:47.260 --> 3:54:50.940]  And of course, we thank him for his and the crew and the viewers for supporting us so we
[3:54:50.940 --> 3:54:52.260]  could help make this film.
[3:54:52.260 --> 3:54:53.940]  We are producers as well.
[3:54:53.940 --> 3:54:54.940]  So that'll be out free tomorrow.
[3:54:54.940 --> 3:54:59.100]  I get your copy of covidland at covidland.com for $195, get a free copy of the in-game
[3:54:59.100 --> 3:55:01.300]  blooper for global enslavement with it.
[3:55:01.300 --> 3:55:03.820]  And we're going to end that deal very, very soon.
[3:55:03.820 --> 3:55:09.180]  Let's go to Enrico in Canada and I'm sorry to Marie, Marine, Mike and Jonathan get their
[3:55:09.180 --> 3:55:11.300]  numbers and we'll call them our first to show.
[3:55:11.300 --> 3:55:13.060]  But Enrico, you're a tailgunner.
[3:55:13.060 --> 3:55:14.060]  Go ahead.
[3:55:14.060 --> 3:55:17.220]  Yeah, I'm just a quick question.
[3:55:17.220 --> 3:55:22.180]  Do you think that the resignation of the premier of New South Wales and then that's
[3:55:22.180 --> 3:55:25.180]  going to cause a real domino effect around the world?
[3:55:25.180 --> 3:55:28.940]  It seems like or do you think we're entering like an actual phase of investigations?
[3:55:28.940 --> 3:55:34.780]  Well, I know that she stepped down or she was paid off by Pfizer and others.
[3:55:34.780 --> 3:55:38.420]  And that's now coming out that all these fousy people on the heads of agencies are
[3:55:38.420 --> 3:55:41.820]  resigning because they were involved in creating the bio weapon.
[3:55:41.820 --> 3:55:45.860]  Robert Barnes, I think there's people in power who know certain information is going
[3:55:45.860 --> 3:55:50.140]  to be coming out over the next month or two, who are trying to make sure they're not in
[3:55:50.140 --> 3:55:55.300]  the firing squad on the wrong side of that firing squad when that information comes out.
[3:55:55.300 --> 3:55:59.660]  So I think it tells you that people in high ranking positions of power know things about
[3:55:59.660 --> 3:56:03.420]  what's happening that they know is going to ultimately likely to be disclosed that they
[3:56:03.420 --> 3:56:07.780]  know will embarrass and undermine and crush this faulty Gates agenda.
[3:56:07.780 --> 3:56:09.980]  Yeah, and here's the danger.
[3:56:09.980 --> 3:56:10.980]  They can set off a nuke.
[3:56:10.980 --> 3:56:14.500]  They can kill the president because they want to get rid of him and blame us.
[3:56:14.500 --> 3:56:16.260]  The public president, we wish no harm upon.
[3:56:16.260 --> 3:56:21.460]  So when I say D-Day, I mean cultural D-Day, you know, Velvet Revolution, not not not physical
[3:56:21.460 --> 3:56:24.740]  because that would that would help them if they keep pushing and put them on camps or
[3:56:24.740 --> 3:56:25.740]  killing us in ditches.
[3:56:25.740 --> 3:56:26.740]  We're not physically fine.
[3:56:26.740 --> 3:56:29.260]  But right now we've got a good chance of beating it peacefully.
[3:56:29.260 --> 3:56:33.620]  Barnes, how are you worried they might try to grab the picture from the jaws of defeat?
[3:56:33.620 --> 3:56:36.940]  I think you have to be you have to expect any kind of a staged event.
[3:56:36.940 --> 3:56:38.700]  I mean, you look at January 6.
[3:56:38.700 --> 3:56:42.980]  It was building and culminating into a meaningful audit review of what happened in the election,
[3:56:42.980 --> 3:56:47.580]  the constitutional process of elector challenges taking place within the halls of Congress.
[3:56:47.580 --> 3:56:52.340]  And they're able to sabotage that by the events of January 6, which now have been proven
[3:56:52.340 --> 3:56:55.660]  to overwhelmingly be involving FBI informants and FBI.
[3:56:55.660 --> 3:56:56.780]  And and Roe v. Wade never happened.
[3:56:56.780 --> 3:56:57.780]  The girl wasn't aborted.
[3:56:57.780 --> 3:56:58.780]  That was all fake.
[3:56:58.780 --> 3:56:59.780]  That's why we question things.
[3:56:59.780 --> 3:57:01.180]  All right, Enrico, you have 30 seconds.
[3:57:01.180 --> 3:57:02.180]  Finish up, brother.
[3:57:02.180 --> 3:57:04.220]  No, that that's about it.
[3:57:04.220 --> 3:57:05.220]  Thanks.
[3:57:05.220 --> 3:57:08.820]  First, did you think that we can place hope on this becoming like a domino effect?
[3:57:08.820 --> 3:57:13.220]  If you pray and if you spread the word, nothing can stop us, you are the power.
[3:57:13.220 --> 3:57:14.620]  It's up to you, brother.
[3:57:14.620 --> 3:57:15.620]  Thank you.
[3:57:15.620 --> 3:57:16.620]  And you're doing it.
[3:57:16.620 --> 3:57:17.620]  You sat on hold.
[3:57:17.620 --> 3:57:18.620]  You came on.
[3:57:18.620 --> 3:57:19.620]  You said that it changes the world.
[3:57:19.620 --> 3:57:20.620]  All right, I'll call the rest of those college back tomorrow.
[3:57:20.620 --> 3:57:22.620]  You're going to be taking a quick break for a little bit of lunch.
[3:57:22.620 --> 3:57:26.820]  Then with Owen Schreuer, who starts now and info wars.com for a show and band on video
[3:57:26.820 --> 3:57:28.420]  and on stations across the country.
[3:57:28.420 --> 3:57:30.020]  That shows getting really popular.
[3:57:30.020 --> 3:57:31.820]  Owen Schreuer is awesome.
[3:57:31.820 --> 3:57:36.740]  Owen, the Cuck destroyer is coming up with Robert Barnes and more 3 p.m. than tomorrow.
[3:57:36.740 --> 3:57:40.780]  The American Journal 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. Before me, there's a Smith Barnes will be on there
[3:57:40.780 --> 3:57:41.780]  as well.
[3:57:41.780 --> 3:57:42.780]  Great job to this crew.
[3:57:42.780 --> 3:57:43.780]  All right.
[3:57:43.780 --> 3:57:44.780]  God bless you all.
[3:57:44.780 --> 3:58:08.340]  Covingland tomorrow at 7 p.m.
