[00:00.000 --> 00:13.640]  It's Wednesday, October 21st, the year is 2020.
[00:13.640 --> 00:22.160]  We are now 12 days, 12 incredible days from the election, 91 from the inauguration.
[00:22.160 --> 00:27.200]  And the forces of globalism are desperately trying to overthrow our country and smash
[00:27.200 --> 00:30.640]  us economically. They become vassals of the globalist corporate
[00:30.640 --> 00:36.080]  combine and the Communist Party of China. But there is also at the same time a huge
[00:36.080 --> 00:41.120]  awakening to what's happening. If you go to infowars.com you'll see the
[00:41.120 --> 00:48.960]  live show feed today and it has a title and it says it all. The globalist crime
[00:48.960 --> 00:59.680]  syndicate, the globalist axis is coming out and incrementally implementing the
[00:59.680 --> 01:05.280]  internet kill switch that is selective through the AI algorithms of these major
[01:05.280 --> 01:09.280]  companies that have unified their policies. And they even came out a month
[01:09.280 --> 01:12.720]  ago and said, oh, we've unified our policies on hate speech, on election
[01:12.720 --> 01:17.440]  muddling, and we're going to be totally controlling people the days before the
[01:17.440 --> 01:23.680]  election, the day of the election, and of course, particularly the weeks after when
[01:23.680 --> 01:28.080]  they're contesting it. So emergency alert with three exclamation points.
[01:28.080 --> 01:33.120]  We never do that. Deep state to activate internet kill switch days before
[01:33.120 --> 01:38.560]  election, globalist big tech, the Communist Chinese, and the captured
[01:38.560 --> 01:45.200]  Democratic Party have successfully tested an AI driven censorship engine capable
[01:45.200 --> 01:50.320]  of selectively silencing billions of people
[01:50.320 --> 01:58.160]  and their online activity instantly. The technocratic axis of evil is moving
[01:58.160 --> 02:02.160]  from beta to full operational. Alex Jones, an expert guest,
[02:02.160 --> 02:07.520]  will lay out what's coming next and how to stop it.
[02:07.520 --> 02:12.000]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen. And the good news is I notice all over
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.360]  Twitter, and I notice all over Facebook, not even looking, people send it to me,
[02:15.360 --> 02:19.760]  you're seeing 50,000 retweets, 60,000 retweets, 10,000 retweets
[02:19.760 --> 02:25.200]  of people going. Jones warned of a global AI censorship grid that will be
[02:25.200 --> 02:29.040]  closing its noose by the day of the election and that they would then
[02:29.040 --> 02:32.320]  contest the election, even though Trump's going to win, and that if he can
[02:32.320 --> 02:35.440]  test their contention, they're planning to burn down the cities.
[02:35.440 --> 02:38.800]  The Democrats and their surrogates, even Elizabeth Warren, has now called for
[02:38.800 --> 02:42.160]  this. Two days ago, Keith Overmans crawled off
[02:42.160 --> 02:45.680]  under his rock and is calling for Trump to be killed.
[02:45.680 --> 02:51.600]  They're making their move. So I would pray to God and get right with
[02:51.600 --> 02:55.200]  God and also then get very active in the streets.
[02:55.200 --> 02:58.240]  You need to be thinking about now what you're going to do in the streets today
[02:58.240 --> 03:01.920]  and tomorrow and the next 12 days, and what you're going to do when this hits
[03:01.920 --> 03:05.120]  because they've got antiphoes going to come out and attack you in blue cities
[03:05.120 --> 03:09.360]  and the police are going to stand down. They're going to kind of deny you access
[03:09.360 --> 03:13.040]  so they can be the only people in the streets demanding Trump be removed.
[03:13.040 --> 03:17.120]  You have to protect the White House. We have to protect
[03:17.120 --> 03:23.200]  the red state governor's facilities. This is a real run at the country because
[03:23.200 --> 03:26.960]  we're so open and we've let so much treason happen and big corporations
[03:26.960 --> 03:30.320]  don't want America to exist and they've come in and bought up the NFL and the
[03:30.320 --> 03:35.760]  NBA and the colleges and it's just all no borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[03:35.760 --> 03:38.960]  That was the old chant. Now it's death to America
[03:38.960 --> 03:44.480]  and burning American flags and look, you'd think I'm not naive but just two
[03:44.480 --> 03:47.760]  years ago they had a big event. They shut down downtown congress. They had a huge
[03:47.760 --> 03:51.840]  stage set up. Almost no one showed up and it was called
[03:51.840 --> 03:57.920]  the lies of Donald Trump and Alex Jones. And so I showed up at it.
[03:57.920 --> 04:01.200]  And of course they ran me off and said, you're not allowed to be here.
[04:01.200 --> 04:05.920]  We're here lying about you. But when I started speaking, when I stood up
[04:05.920 --> 04:10.240]  and I said, look, America's good. We can come together and save America.
[04:10.240 --> 04:14.640]  That's when they all got really upset. This is a cult that wants to capture
[04:14.640 --> 04:20.160]  America and hates everything it stands for, especially Christianity.
[04:20.160 --> 04:23.040]  That's why we've made these politically incorrect shirts.
[04:23.040 --> 04:26.960]  For Paul Joseph Watson to try to fund him, hiring some reporters and expanding
[04:26.960 --> 04:29.440]  what he's doing over at Summit.News. This isn't a pitch.
[04:29.440 --> 04:32.320]  I'm telling you why I'm wearing it. I thought what's more politically
[04:32.320 --> 04:36.240]  incorrect is the original English flag of King George. The original one has the
[04:36.240 --> 04:39.440]  five crosses. Then it got simplified to the Union
[04:39.440 --> 04:42.560]  Jack with the Scottish flag, you know, laid over it.
[04:42.560 --> 04:46.240]  But this is pretty much banned in England as a hate symbol
[04:46.240 --> 04:50.560]  because a country existing is hate. Say, that's why we wear the American flag, we
[04:50.560 --> 04:53.520]  wear the English flag, we wear the Scottish flag, the German flag, the
[04:53.520 --> 04:58.960]  Mexican flag, the Japanese flag. It's all about nationalism.
[04:58.960 --> 05:02.800]  If you pay close attention to what Big Tech is actually saying
[05:02.800 --> 05:06.880]  and more importantly what they're actually doing, when they shut down the
[05:06.880 --> 05:12.400]  Hunter Biden laptop story, that was a test to see if they could work in concert
[05:12.400 --> 05:17.200]  to totally suppress information because they've also been on record saying
[05:17.200 --> 05:20.880]  coming up on election day and thereafter they're not going to let anyone but
[05:20.880 --> 05:24.160]  quote, authoritative sources. That means CNN New York Times want to
[05:24.160 --> 05:27.920]  joke, come out and say who the real winner is.
[05:27.920 --> 05:30.960]  That way they can contest the election even though Trump's declare winner,
[05:30.960 --> 05:34.720]  hold everything up with the ballots, then cause a constitutional crisis,
[05:34.720 --> 05:39.120]  call for secession, and have the UN come in and declare the election for Biden.
[05:39.120 --> 05:41.840]  This is what John Podesta and others are on record saying.
[05:41.840 --> 05:44.960]  And so when you see them in concert censoring something like the Hunter
[05:44.960 --> 05:48.240]  Biden laptop story, that is a drill, that is a test,
[05:48.240 --> 05:51.600]  to get all their systems ready but also to condition the public
[05:51.600 --> 05:55.360]  that Big Tech works in unison to suppress speech and information.
[05:55.360 --> 05:59.920]  This is election meddling 101, this is illegal.
[06:05.600 --> 06:10.880]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[06:10.880 --> 06:19.840]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[06:19.840 --> 06:41.040]  It's Wednesday, October 21st, 12 days out.
[06:41.040 --> 06:45.200]  The 12 days from now, the fight begins as the deep state backed by communist China,
[06:45.200 --> 06:50.160]  the most powerful multinational corporations, the entire globalist Hollywood media,
[06:50.160 --> 06:55.120]  America-hating combine, weigh in and try to break the will of the American people
[06:55.120 --> 07:01.680]  and complete our journey into slavery that they are establishing.
[07:01.680 --> 07:06.000]  Okay, let me lay out what we're going to cover today
[07:06.000 --> 07:11.040]  and the extreme import of all of this and the good news.
[07:11.040 --> 07:15.920]  We've hit a major tipping point. I don't just have some of the top Republican
[07:15.920 --> 07:19.440]  talk show hosts in the country, some of the top people on Fox calling me and
[07:19.440 --> 07:23.840]  saying, we thought you were crazy, it's all true, exactly as you said,
[07:23.840 --> 07:30.400]  what's coming next. Now I have major liberal talk show hosts calling me
[07:30.400 --> 07:37.040]  and major newspaper heads and saying, okay, we thought this was made up in a
[07:37.040 --> 07:41.120]  joke, but now it's out in the open that China is going to conquer the US. We're
[07:41.120 --> 07:44.800]  all being told submit to China. We're all being told that everybody is
[07:44.800 --> 07:48.240]  going to have microchips and get on board because now it's gotten to the point
[07:48.240 --> 07:51.920]  of they're telling the executives and they're telling Hollywood, you are
[07:51.920 --> 07:55.600]  taking a forced inoculation. You are taking five shots a year from
[07:55.600 --> 08:00.320]  Bill Gates and so now they're telling the executives,
[08:00.320 --> 08:03.200]  people worth hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars this and
[08:03.200 --> 08:07.840]  they're like, oh, see they weren't even in on this.
[08:07.840 --> 08:11.360]  And so they're being told, by the way, we've got an internet kill switch, it's
[08:11.360 --> 08:16.000]  selective, it'll kill most websites, we can't even go to them
[08:16.000 --> 08:21.600]  and it'll block in live time and all the major platforms, what you can say and do.
[08:21.600 --> 08:28.000]  A number of years ago in congress, the congressman
[08:28.000 --> 08:34.400]  Wigley, I'm not joking out of Illinois, he said,
[08:34.400 --> 08:39.520]  when are you going to shut down Alex Jones and Paul Watson?
[08:39.520 --> 08:42.640]  Paul Watson has a tweak that's number one today
[08:42.640 --> 08:45.680]  about the guy screaming ala Akbar that ran over a bunch of folks
[08:45.680 --> 08:49.280]  in New York and an article simply pointed out that
[08:49.280 --> 08:52.240]  his local mosque had reported him and said he was planning to do this and
[08:52.240 --> 08:54.960]  nothing was done and it was an Islamic attack.
[08:54.960 --> 09:01.600]  Well, congressman Wigley complained and the heads of Twitter,
[09:01.600 --> 09:05.600]  Facebook and Google, the technical heads of there, they go sir we saw it at lunch
[09:05.600 --> 09:09.520]  and we blocked it, they said within months we're going to have AI in place
[09:09.520 --> 09:13.280]  where it won't be able to do that anymore.
[09:14.640 --> 09:19.200]  Well, that AI is now in place, okay,
[09:19.440 --> 09:22.400]  and they've announced the last few months that they've unified
[09:22.400 --> 09:26.480]  the systems that are over Twitter, Facebook, Google,
[09:26.480 --> 09:31.680]  YouTube, Apple and now even mid-level tech firms are signing on to it
[09:31.680 --> 09:34.560]  and the antivirus firms are signing on to it
[09:34.560 --> 09:41.360]  and at military bases, at most libraries, at most colleges, you can't even go to
[09:41.360 --> 09:45.200]  mpoolwars.com. Well, Trump should stop that.
[09:45.200 --> 09:48.480]  Well, the military says jurisdiction, he told them stop teaching that George
[09:48.480 --> 09:51.760]  Washington's bad and that America is inherently bad, that white people are bad
[09:51.760 --> 09:55.200]  and the Pentagon said we're going to continue
[09:55.200 --> 09:58.480]  the critical race theory that whites are inherently bad.
[09:58.480 --> 10:02.560]  The Secretary of Defense said and Trump didn't fire him because it would just
[10:02.560 --> 10:08.000]  look so crazy. Trump gives orders that are reasonable and they don't stop.
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.440]  University of Texas just pulled their radical race theory,
[10:11.440 --> 10:15.360]  critical race theory because Trump threatened federal funds
[10:15.360 --> 10:18.480]  but I mean it just shows Trump gives orders, they're totally lawful, totally
[10:18.480 --> 10:21.760]  legal. If you ask Martin Luther King, should we teach that white people are
[10:21.760 --> 10:24.560]  bad because the color of their skin, he'd say that's pure racism,
[10:24.560 --> 10:27.040]  that's horrible. We don't need Martin Luther King to tell us that, we already
[10:27.040 --> 10:29.920]  know it but that's what they're teaching to get us at
[10:29.920 --> 10:34.000]  each other's throats. It sure as hell isn't about retribution
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.880]  for any black people, for anything they went through, the globalist hates your
[10:36.880 --> 10:39.840]  guts more than anybody.
[10:39.840 --> 10:42.800]  You're the target of Bill Gates but he funds Black Lives Matter because what
[10:42.800 --> 10:45.360]  does Black Lives Matter say? Get rid of the nuclear
[10:45.360 --> 10:50.800]  family and get
[10:50.800 --> 10:55.760]  black men to sexually change themselves and have their genitals removed.
[10:55.760 --> 11:00.400]  Well that sounds like your friend but they got enough dumb black people and
[11:00.400 --> 11:03.840]  dumb white people and dumb brown people to go out and burn and kill because
[11:03.840 --> 11:07.280]  you know because Trump doesn't want to chop their balls off.
[11:07.280 --> 11:11.760]  You cannot make this up so I can go through all the
[11:11.760 --> 11:15.600]  technicals, I could spend hours here with you going over it.
[11:15.600 --> 11:19.040]  Congress literally is flat-footed, there are a bunch of lawyers,
[11:19.040 --> 11:23.600]  they finally figured out how much trouble they're in and America is at war
[11:23.600 --> 11:28.160]  with a consortium of big tech, the communist Chinese and powerful banks
[11:28.160 --> 11:33.360]  with America haters and the occultist, the Satanist, the whole Hollywood
[11:33.360 --> 11:38.800]  trash group and not all of entertainment's bad, not all of
[11:38.800 --> 11:42.400]  government's bad so there's a real come to Jesus moment as people are going,
[11:42.400 --> 11:47.360]  wait a minute. Everything Jones is saying is exactly
[11:47.360 --> 11:52.160]  what's coming true, what's happening next. Well
[11:52.160 --> 11:56.800]  let me do this, I need to hit the latest on the Giuliani
[11:56.800 --> 12:00.960]  revelations with the Hunter Biden laptop and then more laptops and eyewitnesses
[12:00.960 --> 12:03.440]  and business partners coming out and confirming it all.
[12:03.440 --> 12:07.040]  I mean I told all you people saying we were lying about this, Giuliani knew a
[12:07.040 --> 12:10.400]  month ago, they'd already contacted hundreds of people and gotten them to
[12:10.400 --> 12:13.920]  send back copies of the emails, they went to their houses, they have an army of
[12:13.920 --> 12:18.080]  retired FBI agents and Scotland Yard and CIA, I mean it's
[12:18.080 --> 12:22.320]  over 200 people I'm told now, okay, the Giuliani Scott plowing through, I even
[12:22.320 --> 12:26.880]  know some of the people, plowing through all these emails
[12:26.880 --> 12:30.320]  and then all they do is they call the person up and say yeah this Hunter
[12:30.320 --> 12:33.600]  Biden meeting you had that, this happened, they say absolutely
[12:33.600 --> 12:36.800]  and these people are scared, they know it's criminal so they're saying I'm ready
[12:36.800 --> 12:41.040]  to go public and they're all starting to go public.
[12:42.880 --> 12:46.160]  So they tried to gaslight you that first it didn't exist and it was a
[12:46.160 --> 12:50.480]  Russian disinfo, this makes Hillary's emails
[12:50.480 --> 12:55.040]  look tame in comparison, open and shut, barisma in Ukraine saying
[12:55.040 --> 12:58.240]  listen we'll give you the 30 million and half the company
[12:58.240 --> 13:02.160]  profits but you've got to end the criminal investigations
[13:02.160 --> 13:05.360]  and then his dad goes on TV and brags how he did it for the money.
[13:05.360 --> 13:10.480]  I mean and you read these new Hunter emails that came out to his dad
[13:10.480 --> 13:15.680]  going dad I played with myself in front of a 14-year-old girl
[13:15.680 --> 13:19.280]  and my girlfriend's really upset about it, she may go to the police
[13:19.280 --> 13:22.720]  these are the emails, his dad's like don't worry about it
[13:22.720 --> 13:28.800]  too powerful, these are middle midgets that never grew up past the age of 10
[13:28.800 --> 13:32.240]  that have hundreds of millions of dollars and they're on crack and meth
[13:32.240 --> 13:36.800]  and he's literally like dad pop my girlfriend's gonna leave me she might
[13:36.800 --> 13:41.440]  go to the police told her therapist I jerk off in front of 14-year-olds
[13:41.440 --> 13:45.600]  and yeah I do chase them around outside I mean it's like you chase them around
[13:45.600 --> 13:47.600]  outside and then they call the people and they
[13:47.600 --> 13:51.520]  confirm it like where's hunter chasing girls around
[13:51.520 --> 13:56.320]  at night naked that are 14 I mean what I mean this is all coming out I've got
[13:56.320 --> 14:00.080]  stacks of this and the left is so desperate
[14:00.080 --> 14:03.520]  so many people that were on the right flipped over to the left thing and
[14:03.520 --> 14:07.200]  they're on the winning team your fools doing the right thing is always the
[14:07.200 --> 14:10.080]  winning team eat of you don't win this round it's about what you do in front of
[14:10.080 --> 14:14.240]  god that's next segment but for the republic it's for
[14:14.240 --> 14:17.360]  america for the whole planet
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.960]  when when we put up a little bit of censorship it ends up being total
[14:20.960 --> 14:24.880]  surveillance total control and now it's in place and they said
[14:24.880 --> 14:28.800]  on election day none of conservatives or libertarians or nationalists or
[14:28.800 --> 14:32.000]  patriots or populists are able to communicate they're not able to report fraud
[14:32.000 --> 14:35.520]  you see you're going to be able to report people stuffing ballot boxes
[14:35.520 --> 14:38.560]  there's new video of that coming up you're not going to be able to do any of it
[14:38.560 --> 14:41.920]  you're going to have to do it on local radio and local tv
[14:41.920 --> 14:44.480]  you're going to have to do it on your own email you're going to have to learn to
[14:44.480 --> 14:47.840]  upload videos to another server and send it out over your email
[14:47.840 --> 14:51.200]  you're going to have to learn to call it in to the trump campaign

[15:22.240 --> 15:25.520]  this now he's finally doing it because he
[15:25.520 --> 15:29.440]  understands that there is a massive election fraud operation and we have
[15:29.440 --> 15:33.280]  video from yahoo business where they're in

[16:23.200 --> 16:27.440]  numbers this is our new neurotic control freak
[16:27.440 --> 16:33.280]  society overseen by robots overseen by ai and all of it
[16:33.280 --> 16:36.880]  is designed to make humans non-essential
[16:36.880 --> 16:41.040]  that's why out of the gates they tell us you are non-essential
[16:41.040 --> 16:45.600]  you are non-essential your company your restaurant
[16:45.600 --> 16:49.760]  your job your profession is not essential this is so

[18:29.680 --> 18:34.480]  those white hot coals of fire of truth and justice and christendom
[18:34.480 --> 18:38.160]  could be rekindled into a mighty flame of liberty
[18:38.160 --> 18:41.440]  that will extinguish the darkness that satan's forces
[18:41.440 --> 18:45.920]  have launched upon the earth this is the great test

[21:04.240 --> 21:07.520]  shop from the computer repair shop russia has nothing
[21:07.520 --> 21:11.840]  to do with it but of course biden's buddies brennan and clapper that work
[21:11.840 --> 21:15.280]  for obama and biden and hillary they're saying everything's fine
[21:15.280 --> 21:19.360]  this is all russians yes the russians did it uh i put my shoes on this morning

[21:29.360 --> 21:33.680]  not trump unbelievable the russian misinformation
[21:33.680 --> 21:36.240]  narrative peddled by democrats to protect joe biden
[21:36.240 --> 21:40.400]  was dealt a massive blow when it's being reported by the federalist and by
[21:40.400 --> 21:43.120]  fox and others that senior intel officials have confirmed
[21:43.120 --> 21:46.320]  just everyone understands who people who actually have access to the evidence
[21:46.320 --> 21:50.160]  that the dni and doj say the laptop isn't a russian op
[21:50.160 --> 21:54.880]  these people don't shift they don't operate like he does and say these groups
[21:54.880 --> 21:58.240]  in the media have breathlessly been reporting on
[21:58.240 --> 22:02.080]  here's another one oh boy rudy juliani reads text message from hunter
[22:02.080 --> 22:06.160]  biden to joe biden talking about facetiming 14-year-old girl
[22:06.160 --> 22:10.640]  naked while smoking crack but it gets worse then he says i'm running around
[22:10.640 --> 22:14.160]  with her in the in the yard i guess he's
[22:14.160 --> 22:18.240]  chasing his his niece and then his girlfriend comes home and catches it i
[22:18.240 --> 22:22.160]  mean it's just it's just unbelievable and notice
[22:22.160 --> 22:25.680]  they're silent about this they don't deny it
[22:25.680 --> 22:28.960]  it goes on and on hunter biden's emails reportedly turned over to delaware
[22:28.960 --> 22:32.560]  state police to the fbi again the fbi confirms they got them
[22:32.560 --> 22:36.560]  almost a year ago juliani gives hunter biden's hard
[22:36.560 --> 22:39.520]  drive to delaware state police over photos of underage girls
[22:39.520 --> 22:45.040]  disturbing texts including him naked in the photos with them
[22:45.040 --> 22:51.040]  because he's a trophy hunter folks he takes a photo
[22:51.040 --> 22:55.920]  with the little girl with his niece showing off
[22:55.920 --> 22:59.440]  what he's done because these pedophiles like to share it
[22:59.440 --> 23:02.640]  they like to do it out in the open like pop does pop
[23:02.640 --> 23:08.640]  taunting if i had to bet i bet biden's popped hunter
[23:08.640 --> 23:12.080]  i bet he's that old hunter i'm serious folks that's how these satanists operate
[23:12.080 --> 23:15.440]  they want to dominate they want to abuse i bet hunter's been under ritual
[23:15.440 --> 23:20.160]  abuse these people are satanist folks
[23:20.160 --> 23:23.840]  and they commit crimes so horrible that society's afraid to come out with it i
[23:23.840 --> 23:26.240]  mean you think just the catholic church got taken over by this
[23:26.240 --> 23:29.920]  you think just penn state you just think all these big protestant churches keep
[23:29.920 --> 23:33.840]  getting caught doing this it's because these people use this to take
[23:33.840 --> 23:37.120]  over it's a cult of pedophiles and they're in every group
[23:37.120 --> 23:41.680]  they're in every organization and trump has now 10 fold increased arrest so 12
[23:41.680 --> 23:43.920]  fold now he's created an international
[23:43.920 --> 23:47.200]  task force in a department to stop human smuggling and
[23:47.200 --> 23:51.200]  trafficking of adults and children and the democrats won't say a word about it
[23:51.200 --> 23:55.280]  because it's one of their biggest currencies
[23:55.280 --> 23:58.720]  type in un sex traffic type in un sex slaves 80
[23:58.720 --> 24:02.720]  un sex slaves uh the the Balkans it's all
[24:02.720 --> 24:06.480]  thousands of children per country where they've been caught
[24:06.480 --> 24:11.040]  because you and people blew the whistle and a lot of these kids get killed
[24:11.040 --> 24:14.720]  my first film there's what about design i have blurred out photos
[24:14.720 --> 24:21.200]  of three-year-old african children being raped to death with nightsticks
[24:21.200 --> 24:25.280]  but first they're held over fires and roasted
[24:25.280 --> 24:29.280]  now why the hell would you do that because you're
[24:29.280 --> 24:34.080]  in to evil and y'all tell you black lives do matter
[24:34.080 --> 24:38.240]  it's open season on black people in the caribbean it's open season on black
[24:38.240 --> 24:43.280]  people in africa by these globalists because they have no one to speak for
[24:43.280 --> 24:46.640]  them and bill gates can test whatever he wants on them and he's been caught
[24:46.640 --> 24:50.480]  and i don't say that the virtue signal of black people i just see another person
[24:50.480 --> 24:53.920]  they're doing it to them because they get away with it you know gates wants it
[24:53.920 --> 24:57.440]  for everybody he said that and now he's coming for you

[25:01.200 --> 25:06.720]  protections are being stripped away and we're all in grave danger

[25:24.400 --> 25:31.120]  rentable and it goes on from there

[29:22.400 --> 29:26.640]  of what you're doing on the apps as well including having apps turn on
[29:26.640 --> 29:30.640]  and listen to what you're saying just like siri or alexa do
[29:30.640 --> 29:34.480]  and then putting databases transcripts of everything you say
[29:34.480 --> 29:38.320]  into those systems to be saved forever your phone is spying on you
[29:38.320 --> 29:42.160]  and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information

[30:33.920 --> 30:38.880]  and won't let us alone because we're the ones they're gonna find
[30:38.880 --> 30:43.440]  running on our way all right ladies and gentlemen

[30:50.880 --> 30:54.640]  quantify this i don't need to tell you that you can cut the suspense with a
[30:54.640 --> 30:57.120]  knife i don't need to tell you how predatory that the
[30:57.120 --> 31:00.720]  globalist are i don't need to tell you that they are a foreign multinational
[31:00.720 --> 31:06.880]  consortium a new type of war globalism taking us over
[31:06.880 --> 31:11.600]  i'm just telling you that you cannot see yourself
[31:11.600 --> 31:15.920]  as someone that just supports this broadcast which is wonderful
[31:15.920 --> 31:19.360]  and is key or just votes for trump you're going
[31:19.360 --> 31:23.760]  to have to hit the streets you're going to have to get aggressive
[31:23.760 --> 31:27.680]  you're going to have to do nonviolent peaceful civil disobedience
[31:27.680 --> 31:33.280]  now and i'll just be honest with you uh i engaged in some today
[31:33.280 --> 31:39.440]  and i don't i gotta have the energy to do it because i work hard
[31:39.440 --> 31:42.640]  i'm just gonna say it i'm gonna go out with a bunch of spray paint tonight
[31:42.640 --> 31:47.840]  and uh i'm gonna tag stuff the big things that can be seen on the highway
[31:47.840 --> 31:50.320]  and i don't care if they come find me or arrest me i don't care anymore
[31:50.320 --> 31:54.240]  to see what a jury does um and and and you know the globalists want to burn
[31:54.240 --> 31:57.360]  down police stations to shoot cops in the head i don't want to do that
[31:57.360 --> 32:02.640]  but i'm gonna get big messages out and i'm not telling you what to do
[32:02.640 --> 32:04.880]  but
[32:06.880 --> 32:10.640]  and i'm gonna get more aggressive than that i swear to god excuse me lord i'm
[32:10.640 --> 32:13.920]  not supposed to i'm not taking your lord's name in vain because i'm gonna swear on god
[32:13.920 --> 32:20.400]  i just came out of me i just i you need to be thinking every minute
[32:20.400 --> 32:26.000]  about what you're gonna be doing and then also we need to make oaths
[32:26.000 --> 32:29.680]  just to our friends and family and and and and before god
[32:29.680 --> 32:34.480]  a commitment that
[32:36.000 --> 32:39.760]  when bill gates rolls out his deadly m rna vaccine and it does kill people and
[32:39.760 --> 32:42.800]  main people it already is in the trials that he will be held responsible
[32:42.800 --> 32:48.240]  regardless of what courts do and that he's not above reality and not above god
[32:48.240 --> 32:51.680]  and we need to have discussions about that
[32:52.960 --> 32:55.600]  i'm like well that's a dangerous person we don't need to work or not well he's
[32:55.600 --> 32:59.920]  coming after us so we have a metaphysical right
[32:59.920 --> 33:05.680]  and we have a metaphysical duty to do that
[33:05.840 --> 33:09.760]  and i'm not gonna sit here and just talk on the ear
[33:09.760 --> 33:12.480]  and it's really good to promote this stuff digitally but that they're bringing
[33:12.480 --> 33:16.400]  the kill switches in you're going to i should have whole shows about what do
[33:16.400 --> 33:19.760]  you do what do you do wear t-shirts that does something to show
[33:19.760 --> 33:23.120]  solidarity to exercise free speech the enemy's face they hate it
[33:23.120 --> 33:26.000]  go speak in front of your church go speak at city council that's all locked
[33:26.000 --> 33:29.200]  down so they locked us down for this they know what they're doing
[33:29.200 --> 33:31.520]  um
[33:32.960 --> 33:36.160]  do you go make leftist uncomfortable like on south congress
[33:36.160 --> 33:40.400]  which is like the worst parts of la at austin and drive by every weekend we do
[33:40.400 --> 33:44.800]  on saturday and bullhorn them about the evil they're involved in and the
[33:44.800 --> 33:49.040]  overblown fraud of covet now it's killing millions with a lockdown
[33:49.040 --> 33:52.000]  now the un even has to admit that yeah that's something we can do and i i fly
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.000]  drones with speakers over zilker park and try to educate folks i'm just saying
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.840]  you've all got to do this because let me explain something
[33:59.840 --> 34:02.480]  if you don't speak up and if you don't get involved if you don't hit the
[34:02.480 --> 34:06.800]  streets now you never will
[34:06.800 --> 34:10.880]  because they are going to cut the resources off here like they've done
[34:10.880 --> 34:14.080]  in the third world and they are bringing us into a hella situation
[34:14.080 --> 34:19.360]  and and the key to their whole system is that you have a
[34:19.360 --> 34:23.440]  eight second attention span now no you really
[34:23.440 --> 34:27.200]  still have your deep attention span your values your default but the average
[34:27.200 --> 34:31.120]  person really is caught about a seven second attention span
[34:31.120 --> 34:34.880]  our attention spans used to be about an hour long just uh 70 years ago so
[34:34.880 --> 34:37.280]  everything's went about getting our attention span
[34:37.280 --> 34:40.400]  where like the dog in the movie up where he can't ever get anything done
[34:40.400 --> 34:43.440]  because if he thinks he sees a squirrel or a piece of trash blows by he goes
[34:43.440 --> 34:46.560]  oh squirrel like hey we need to save the little kids
[34:46.560 --> 34:50.800]  they're in trouble oh squirrel then runs off after squirrel doesn't save the kids
[34:50.800 --> 34:54.320]  we're not a labrador retriever you know they're cute they're great
[34:54.320 --> 35:00.080]  but their attention span is very very short humans have long attention spans
[35:00.080 --> 35:06.720]  and focus is the key to success knowing your roots knowing what you stand for
[35:06.720 --> 35:09.760]  understanding what's got to be done and then having focus and dedication
[35:09.760 --> 35:17.600]  and repetition
[35:17.600 --> 35:23.520]  so you've got to do what you've got to do legally and lawfully
[35:23.520 --> 35:26.800]  and with civil disobedience at this point to get the truth out maybe that
[35:26.800 --> 35:31.120]  means you go rent a big projector they have these in every major city
[35:31.120 --> 35:35.680]  and you just get it done and you go project huge messages every night on
[35:35.680 --> 35:38.560]  the sides of big buildings in the most populous areas
[35:38.560 --> 35:45.040]  with messages like covid came from china or info wars dot com
[35:45.040 --> 35:49.440]  or america's fighting for its life or communist china runs biden
[35:49.440 --> 35:54.240]  or vote trump everything you do changes the world and you need to go
[35:54.240 --> 35:58.080]  volunteer now in most states they have to let you volunteer you need to get
[35:58.080 --> 36:01.760]  into the polling places now because the democrats are
[36:01.760 --> 36:05.520]  harvesting ballots changing ballots falsifying throwing them away
[36:05.520 --> 36:09.280]  they're getting arrested everywhere it makes the local news but doesn't do
[36:09.280 --> 36:13.280]  anything else so local public servants have
[36:13.280 --> 36:16.320]  doing a pretty good job around the country from pennsylvania to texas to
[36:16.320 --> 36:20.240]  michigan do you name it catching democrats it's always democrats it's
[36:20.240 --> 36:23.840]  never republican see they know they tell republicans don't
[36:23.840 --> 36:26.080]  leave your house you don't democrats do whatever they want
[36:26.080 --> 36:31.600]  they know uh they say uh don't see it on elections you wouldn't do it anyways
[36:31.600 --> 36:34.800]  they know you have morals so they they use that against you
[36:34.800 --> 36:38.000]  and i'm not saying get rid of your morals i'm not saying go cheat
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.160]  i'm saying go after them
[36:42.160 --> 36:45.920]  and show the criminal activity they're involved in we got to go to break and
[36:45.920 --> 36:48.640]  i'm gonna come back into the technicals of this then i'll get more into
[36:48.640 --> 36:52.080]  what's coming out on biden and it's just devastating and and there's no way
[36:52.080 --> 36:55.200]  the media can cover this up but what's the real story here
[36:55.200 --> 37:00.800]  that the corporate media to a to an institution
[37:00.800 --> 37:06.640]  throughout the system is not covering now confirmed photos of biden with
[37:06.640 --> 37:09.760]  underage girls naked
[37:11.920 --> 37:15.600]  and notice it gets worse what juliani brings out every couple days
[37:15.600 --> 37:18.880]  that's done on purpose to have the system cover it up they know what's in
[37:18.880 --> 37:22.000]  there and then just devastate them with stuff so bad
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.640]  there's nothing they can do and i told you it's sex abuse of children
[37:26.640 --> 37:33.360]  they brought this out because this is an email to his dad about hey
[37:33.360 --> 37:36.880]  my girlfriend's mad at me hey they caught me with the 14-year-old naked
[37:36.880 --> 37:42.160]  i was on crack and that's his brother's daughter
[37:42.640 --> 37:45.440]  they're bringing that out now does it connect it to biden
[37:45.440 --> 37:49.760]  but it's connected to biden that he reportedly was in china
[37:49.760 --> 37:53.920]  raping what looks like 10-year-old girls and beating the hell out of them
[37:53.920 --> 37:56.880]  and that's what witnesses that have seen the video say happens
[37:56.880 --> 38:00.800]  they say it's brutal i mean we're talking just boom right in the job
[38:00.800 --> 38:03.920]  little girl's crying i mean that's who these people are look what they do to
[38:03.920 --> 38:05.760]  your economy look what they do to your country
[38:05.760 --> 38:09.360]  why would you join the chai comms why would you do evil things why would you
[38:09.360 --> 38:12.080]  bankrupt the country why would you triple charge people for
[38:12.080 --> 38:15.920]  for prescription drugs and screw up society why why because they're
[38:15.920 --> 38:18.880]  evil folks
[38:18.880 --> 38:22.480]  they say hitler would have won world war two
[38:22.480 --> 38:26.400]  if in 1943 he didn't say looks like we're probably going to lose down the
[38:26.400 --> 38:29.040]  road put all the resources into killing
[38:29.040 --> 38:34.000]  these undesirable groups jews namely central
[38:34.240 --> 38:38.240]  because he just wanted to kill people all right we're going to go to break uh

[43:26.560 --> 43:30.160]  because the power of the people overrode them four years ago
[43:30.160 --> 43:33.200]  trump has finally figured this out since he's going to take action
[43:33.200 --> 43:36.480]  once reelected against big tech i mean he's modern in the situation
[43:36.480 --> 43:38.960]  well we know the president's overwhelmed right now so we're going to sit here and
[43:38.960 --> 43:43.280]  cry because he has taken action we the people are taking action now you can
[43:43.280 --> 43:46.240]  do it very very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com
[43:46.240 --> 43:50.800]  2020ElectionCenter.com and checking out the new redesign info wars.com
[43:50.800 --> 43:55.520]  and sharing that link oh that's really obsessive oh yeah
[43:58.080 --> 44:02.880]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[44:02.880 --> 44:12.880]  you
[44:15.680 --> 44:23.520]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 the answer
[44:23.520 --> 44:29.520]  is looking at you in the mirror welcome back i'm your host alex jones
[44:29.520 --> 44:37.920]  okay let me do this there's just so much here
[44:37.920 --> 44:40.960]  roger stone i should have told you that i didn't tell you yesterday
[44:40.960 --> 44:44.480]  he's going to be handicapping the election giving you his concerns he is
[44:44.480 --> 44:47.360]  concerned he's a realist but there's still time for
[44:47.360 --> 44:50.160]  trump to win he's going to be joining us next hour
[44:50.160 --> 44:53.200]  so i look forward to that then we will open the phones up
[44:53.200 --> 44:59.440]  in the third hour on this live
[44:59.440 --> 45:03.280]  wednesday october 21st transmission uh tonight we're going to have live
[45:03.280 --> 45:06.880]  coverage of the town hall and tomorrow night live coverage of the debate
[45:06.880 --> 45:10.480]  all the coverage is at band dot video but that is banned on twitter you can't
[45:10.480 --> 45:13.600]  share that link even though jack dorsi pledged to
[45:13.600 --> 45:17.200]  stop blocking URLs he's a total liar he lied to congress in a letter saying we
[45:17.200 --> 45:22.160]  don't do that you can share 2020ElectionCenter.com
[45:22.160 --> 45:26.960]  2020 is the numbers 2020ElectionCenter.com and that is
[45:26.960 --> 45:32.480]  your patriotic mission your self-preservation mission if you choose
[45:32.480 --> 45:35.200]  to accept it
[45:36.720 --> 45:40.560]  but just finishing up what i was saying earlier
[45:40.560 --> 45:44.320]  you just think about how warfare works especially psychological warfare you
[45:44.320 --> 45:48.880]  can't just flip an internet kill switch on and then congress would stand up the
[45:48.880 --> 45:51.760]  people would stand up people would recognize a frontal assault
[45:51.760 --> 45:54.880]  everything with globalism is lawyers and think tanks
[45:54.880 --> 45:59.680]  and creeping death and everything is hidden everything is
[45:59.680 --> 46:06.320]  sleight of hand everything is wizardry fraud con artistry
[46:06.320 --> 46:16.640]  flim flam and so that's why i knew when i saw them demonize us then censor us
[46:16.640 --> 46:19.440]  to make a big deal about how they were censoring us
[46:19.440 --> 46:23.120]  they wanted to demonize somebody and then silence them and have other people
[46:23.120 --> 46:26.240]  agree with it so that then they wouldn't notice everybody else that got
[46:26.240 --> 46:30.400]  silenced and you could see it and we got internal
[46:30.400 --> 46:33.680]  emails and documents and people at google were upset and twitter and
[46:33.680 --> 46:36.880]  we knew what was happening
[46:38.400 --> 46:41.600]  and then you see these two and a half years later it's now the president
[46:41.600 --> 46:45.360]  it's congress it's all of them so they've got an algorithm
[46:45.360 --> 46:49.920]  they've got a technique to carry all of this out
[46:49.920 --> 46:54.000]  and if we're aware of how they run the scam it's game over but if congress and
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.560]  the public and all of us keep addressing the globalist
[46:56.560 --> 46:59.680]  according to their terms the way they address us
[46:59.680 --> 47:02.800]  they always address you with a fraud and a fraudulent discussion
[47:02.800 --> 47:06.160]  and a fraudulent debate knowing you're not sophisticated and don't know how
[47:06.160 --> 47:10.560]  they operate but if you just learn how they operate
[47:10.560 --> 47:13.760]  even if you were a sociopath you don't make
[47:13.760 --> 47:18.080]  money and get power at this stage of the game joining the new world order
[47:18.080 --> 47:22.160]  you become successful knowing what they know and using that knowledge against
[47:22.160 --> 47:25.120]  them i use that knowledge to defeat them
[47:25.120 --> 47:28.480]  someone that just wanted to make money and get powerful could get incredibly
[47:28.480 --> 47:32.400]  powerful with this knowledge and that's why they can't stand the show because
[47:32.400 --> 47:36.320]  we're covering real issues here on air that if there's
[47:36.320 --> 47:40.400]  ever an understanding of how these systems work it's game over for them
[47:40.400 --> 47:43.680]  you see i didn't go to college to be a lawyer go to college be a political
[47:43.680 --> 47:47.280]  scientist i read those textbooks
[47:47.280 --> 47:51.600]  i went to the school of research in the school of the street and the school of
[47:51.600 --> 47:56.000]  building something myself that interfaced with the world
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.520]  so that i could discover how it really worked
[47:59.520 --> 48:03.280]  and i discovered how it really works
[48:06.320 --> 48:10.320]  you've discovered how it really works it's called common sense and most of you
[48:10.320 --> 48:14.160]  have more common sense than the top politicians in dc
[48:14.160 --> 48:17.600]  they're specialists that were brought in by other corrupt individuals because
[48:17.600 --> 48:21.040]  they went along with them and their value system is different than ours
[48:21.040 --> 48:24.560]  they want power control dumb down slaves we want a great society for our
[48:24.560 --> 48:27.520]  children with other people's children and we love god and we just want to be
[48:27.520 --> 48:32.560]  good and be happy they're not going to let us do that
[48:32.560 --> 48:35.920]  and so they've already implemented and they admit these numbers
[48:35.920 --> 48:42.320]  that conservatives are censored 96% from the reach they had two years ago
[48:42.320 --> 48:45.360]  now that's the next phase remember what i said in all those articles we wrote
[48:45.360 --> 48:49.600]  years ago first when hillary lost they banned us 96%
[48:49.600 --> 48:52.800]  i can see it on all the servers and all the metrics and
[48:52.800 --> 48:57.040]  alexa.com and all of it 96%
[48:57.040 --> 49:00.960]  cut in letting us reach people there it was still there
[49:00.960 --> 49:05.360]  but it was governed back i don't know why it's 96% the algorithm they're using
[49:05.360 --> 49:08.080]  they've got other algorithms now the communist chinese wrote that are in the
[49:08.080 --> 49:11.360]  news that are they're being used as well and then they got former stasi heads
[49:11.360 --> 49:13.920]  coming in east german secret police and help run it i mean
[49:13.920 --> 49:17.840]  there's a lot of stuff going on here but well now that's what the republicans
[49:17.840 --> 49:22.080]  are saying like we've got a 96 reduction in our reach
[49:22.080 --> 49:26.480]  and then you get used to that and then they finally take you down to about 1%
[49:26.480 --> 49:29.840]  and then when no one's there and no one hears you and no one cares
[49:29.840 --> 49:33.600]  when you've been metaphysically brought out in the woods a six-foot hole's been
[49:33.600 --> 49:37.360]  dug they shoot you in the back of the head and ban your ass
[49:37.360 --> 49:42.320]  metaphysically and then
[49:45.600 --> 49:48.720]  everyone else
[49:48.720 --> 49:53.280]  sees what happened to you and they keep their mouth shut and here's the secret
[49:53.280 --> 49:56.720]  they're already deep into the process themselves
[49:56.720 --> 50:01.120]  of being shadow banned it's already closing the net they may be 20%
[50:01.120 --> 50:06.720]  banned 50% 70% 80% 96% but when you finally get totally
[50:06.720 --> 50:10.560]  banned they don't say anything because they don't
[50:10.560 --> 50:14.320]  want to be the next person to get banned and that's how the psychology works
[50:14.320 --> 50:18.240]  and that's why they do it incrementally and i know you know that
[50:18.240 --> 50:22.160]  but they're going to get everybody they're going to get the new york post
[50:22.160 --> 50:24.640]  they're going to get the washington post they're going to get joe rogan
[50:24.640 --> 50:27.200]  they're going to get rush limbaugh they're going to get sean hannity
[50:27.200 --> 50:30.560]  they're going to get tucker carlson and tuckers understood this for three four
[50:30.560 --> 50:33.040]  years i've been friends with tucker for
[50:33.040 --> 50:35.920]  about eight nine
[50:36.800 --> 50:41.200]  so but he still thought i'm he still laughed at me at dinner and stuff
[50:41.200 --> 50:45.440]  eight years ago he doesn't laugh anymore
[50:45.440 --> 50:48.320]  it was just a fun friendly laugh you know he went for thinking i was really a bad
[50:48.320 --> 50:51.520]  guy a total liar to okay alex just means well he's wrong about some stuff
[50:51.520 --> 50:54.720]  right about a lot to well how the hell do you know all this and i'm not bragging
[50:54.720 --> 50:58.720]  about that i'm saying that's the path of leadership
[50:58.720 --> 51:02.400]  knowing you're right knowing that it doesn't matter what happens to you
[51:02.400 --> 51:05.680]  you've got to tell the truth for everybody in the balance including your
[51:05.680 --> 51:08.400]  children and then being proven right a lot of people
[51:08.400 --> 51:11.520]  fight their whole lives tell the truth and get nothing but destroyed over it
[51:11.520 --> 51:15.280]  i'm so blessed that i'm living to see myself vindicated
[51:15.280 --> 51:19.440]  and let me tell you why that is because of you
[51:19.440 --> 51:22.640]  they would have had me in prison they would have had me destroyed already and
[51:22.640 --> 51:25.760]  they still may but you financially supported us
[51:25.760 --> 51:29.040]  and you prayed for me and you prayed for our operation
[51:29.040 --> 51:32.880]  and you spread the word about us and you know how much that means to me because
[51:32.880 --> 51:36.560]  i don't want to lose and i quite frankly don't want to be in prison or dead
[51:36.560 --> 51:40.160]  but i'm gonna do this fight no matter what but you came through dammit and i
[51:40.160 --> 51:42.960]  appreciate you that's why when you call up thinking
[51:42.960 --> 51:46.000]  me it's like what the hell are you talking about man
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.080]  you're like a life raft and i'm in freezing water and barely get on board
[51:50.080 --> 51:56.080]  and the life rafts thanking me oh no i'm thanking you
[51:57.440 --> 52:01.600]  and praise god that this is coming out about the bides and how horrible they
[52:01.600 --> 52:04.160]  are and we already knew there were pedophiles to set it you know
[52:04.160 --> 52:07.520]  eight nine years ago but about the biden specifically
[52:07.520 --> 52:11.200]  and how he's degenerating neurologically in the last five it can't keep his hands
[52:11.200 --> 52:14.720]  off anybody and he comes up to good-looking women at events in
[52:14.720 --> 52:18.080]  in restaurants and just starts grabbing women's breasts there's video that and
[52:18.080 --> 52:21.360]  the husband's like what the hell are you doing the woman's like what the hell
[52:21.360 --> 52:24.800]  these are people that are used to doing whatever
[52:24.800 --> 52:30.080]  they want whenever they want however they want
[52:30.080 --> 52:33.680]  they're totally and completely out of control because they're used to
[52:33.680 --> 52:39.920]  everyone bowing down to them but you didn't so despite all my stumbles
[52:39.920 --> 52:43.120]  you the listeners and supporters the affiliates the station managers the
[52:43.120 --> 52:46.720]  sponsors we used to have this crew putting up with me
[52:46.720 --> 52:50.480]  and believe me i'm i mean i'm what you see on air is what you get behind the
[52:50.480 --> 52:53.280]  scenes even worse
[52:53.360 --> 52:56.800]  we did it folks i mean trump may get killed he may lose i think he's probably
[52:56.800 --> 53:00.160]  gonna win but it doesn't matter they're all exposed now and they're all been
[53:00.160 --> 53:02.800]  caught with their pedophilia and their devil worship and their chai con and
[53:02.800 --> 53:05.600]  there's no putting it back together again they're done
[53:05.600 --> 53:09.040]  they're done they're done they're done they're done
[53:09.040 --> 53:12.560]  now i might be done but i don't care about myself at the end of the day i care
[53:12.560 --> 53:15.920]  about the continuum of humanity because i'm part of that i
[53:15.920 --> 53:20.720]  surfed in on my ancestors will and you're surfing in on their will and
[53:20.720 --> 53:25.840]  we're surfing this this this together and as long as we make it as a people
[53:25.840 --> 53:30.480]  humans into the future into the stars we win and
[53:30.480 --> 53:35.280]  that's all that matters because that is certain eternal genetic
[53:35.280 --> 53:40.560]  life and god always operates in three levels
[53:40.560 --> 53:46.160]  because i've i've not read it in the book i've seen i've i've literally
[53:46.160 --> 53:49.600]  god give me the download in the last three years
[53:49.600 --> 53:53.520]  and i have literally seen across the other side and i've seen back in the
[53:53.520 --> 53:58.160]  time which loops back around and it's incredible the three systems
[53:58.160 --> 54:01.760]  you are genetically all of your ancestors
[54:01.760 --> 54:07.920]  and that is a resonance of information that passes forward genetically and
[54:07.920 --> 54:12.400]  spiritually into higher dimensions and then you're that key seed of god's
[54:12.400 --> 54:18.640]  free will and intellect that splintered off from god into you little g
[54:18.640 --> 54:23.360]  and then you're also the giant living cultural mass manifestations of what we
[54:23.360 --> 54:27.760]  build and then all the the things we're attempting
[54:27.760 --> 54:30.160]  to create something sentient and something with free will because we're
[54:30.160 --> 54:34.640]  trying to copy our father if you see how masterful that is how
[54:34.640 --> 54:43.920]  incredible that is we'll be right back stay where this roger stove coming up
[54:43.920 --> 54:47.360]  as i take this announcement we were exactly 14 days out
[54:47.360 --> 54:51.040]  from the election when the globalist controlled democrats
[54:51.040 --> 54:54.800]  know that america has woken up to them and turned against them the whole planet
[54:54.800 --> 54:58.560]  is a huge populace realignment and so they've openly said
[54:58.560 --> 55:02.640]  we need to go to pure authoritarianism not just censorship but physically
[55:02.640 --> 55:07.280]  attacking and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our agenda
[55:07.280 --> 55:10.560]  and they're on record saying that once they remove trump they are going to
[55:10.560 --> 55:13.760]  persecute trumps base and going to try to
[55:13.760 --> 55:17.600]  prosecute us and put us all in prison this is what
[55:17.600 --> 55:21.600]  all the old clinton easters are saying it's what the obama bots are saying
[55:21.600 --> 55:25.760]  it's what keith oberman's saying it's what antsy blocey saying
[55:25.760 --> 55:29.920]  this is their stated criminal authoritarian intent
[55:29.920 --> 55:33.600]  and they intend to keep the lockdowns going forever and forced inoculations
[55:33.600 --> 55:37.040]  trump is trying to end the lockdowns and is saying vaccines will be
[55:37.040 --> 55:42.160]  voluntary donald trump or die we've got to get trump in everybody get out there
[55:42.160 --> 55:46.400]  and vote and tell your family to vote now with two weeks left until the

[57:40.320 --> 57:44.240]  segment he wants to get into the hunter biden the real scoop on this what's
[57:44.240 --> 57:47.200]  coming out next then we're gonna look at the states the
[57:47.200 --> 57:51.200]  election is trump behind is he dead heat is he ahead
[57:51.200 --> 57:55.040]  roger's a real realist here so he'll talk about with 12 days out
[57:55.040 --> 57:59.520]  what is coming up and so much more but there's a video that's really gone
[57:59.520 --> 58:03.280]  viral at bandot video part one of it like 300
[58:03.280 --> 58:05.600]  thousand views that's pretty good for bandot video
[58:05.600 --> 58:08.480]  our thing on the biden's got about three million views right now but
[58:08.480 --> 58:12.400]  what will happen in 2025 our great wilson put this out one of our crew
[58:12.400 --> 58:15.440]  members and part two just came out as well so
[58:15.440 --> 58:22.560]  here is part one what will happen in 2025 what will happen in 2025 an
[58:22.560 --> 58:26.640]  international forecasting website deagle.com
[58:26.640 --> 58:31.920]  published an interactive graph where it projects future prospects or trends
[58:31.920 --> 58:34.560]  for any nation in the world that you click on
[58:34.560 --> 58:37.760]  although the graph has been updated since 2013
[58:37.760 --> 58:41.200]  their site currently charts changes in population
[58:41.200 --> 58:47.680]  GDP and other national factors of almost every country in the world from 2017 to
[58:47.680 --> 58:51.760]  2025 allowing you to easily cross compare the
[58:51.760 --> 58:56.720]  statistics they forecast that from 2017 to 2025
[58:56.720 --> 59:02.320]  the united states population will be cut down to less than a third of its size
[59:02.320 --> 59:07.200]  from 327 million to 100 million while the UK is
[59:07.200 --> 59:11.760]  whittled down to almost a sixth of its 2017 size
[59:11.760 --> 59:17.760]  66 million to 15 million France loses nearly half of their population
[59:17.760 --> 59:23.920]  while Germany is inexplicably trimmed down from 81 million to 28 million
[59:23.920 --> 59:28.560]  during this same stretch of time China and Russia are projected to maintain the
[59:28.560 --> 59:32.000]  same population while India and Brazil grow by a
[59:32.000 --> 59:35.840]  few million more people why are populations dramatically
[59:35.840 --> 59:40.480]  disappearing in such a short amount of time and why 2025
[59:40.480 --> 59:47.360]  deagle's forecast says that the US's GDP will fall from 19 trillion dollars to
[59:47.360 --> 59:51.040]  1.6 trillion dollars less than a tenth of its
[59:51.040 --> 59:56.640]  former self from 2017 the UK drops from 2.9 trillion to
[59:56.640 --> 1:00:02.000]  132 billion while Canada France and Germany follow suit
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:06.560]  dropping from the trillions to the hundreds of billions in GDP
[1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:12.480]  however China and Russia are expected to grow their GDP by 1 trillion
[1:00:12.480 --> 1:00:19.040]  and over 2 trillion respectively while Brazil maintains a stable GDP at 3.2
[1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:22.480]  trillion and India loses only 2 trillion of its
[1:00:22.480 --> 1:00:26.720]  projected 7.3 trillion the defense budget for each
[1:00:26.720 --> 1:00:30.160]  western nation follows the same trend a sharp
[1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:35.680]  drop in the billions while as predictably predicted by deagle.com
[1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:40.960]  China Russia India and Brazil increase their defense budget in the double and
[1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:44.880]  triple digit billions clearly showing a major shift in
[1:00:44.880 --> 1:00:49.760]  national military power worldwide countries associated with the economic
[1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:54.240]  development group known as BRIC Brazil Russia India China
[1:00:54.240 --> 1:00:57.840]  arrive in a future with greater population stability
[1:00:57.840 --> 1:01:03.040]  a growing GDP and a booming defense budget why does deagle predict
[1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:08.960]  such a bleak 2025 for North America and Europe little is known about the owners
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:12.240]  of deagle.com but according to their own website
[1:01:12.240 --> 1:01:16.640]  deagle is partners with and clients of the NSA
[1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:21.840]  NATO the World Bank the United Nations and other national and international
[1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:25.440]  agencies they say the economic and demographic data
[1:01:25.440 --> 1:01:29.440]  used in the making of their forecasts is widely available by
[1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:35.200]  institutions such as the CIA IMF UN and USG
[1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:40.240]  also they make it clear that they are quote not linked to any government in
[1:01:40.240 --> 1:01:46.160]  any way shape or form either way what will happen in 2025
[1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:49.840]  and why do multiple other publications predict
[1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:56.640]  2025 to be a tumultuous year. In fiction super villains are known as
[1:01:56.640 --> 1:02:00.000]  super villains because they have gigantic huge
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:03.360]  global plants that are incredibly well thought out
[1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:07.280]  and incredibly complex and about I told you a year ago back in October
[1:02:07.280 --> 1:02:11.920]  in 2019 that a powerful billionaire who controls the UN would roll out a
[1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:15.200]  global hysteria and lock down the planet start
[1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:19.440]  millions of people and would be pushing a forced inoculation to even be able to
[1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:22.560]  leave your houses and that this same billionaire would say we're all going to
[1:02:22.560 --> 1:02:25.200]  work from home now and that this was good to
[1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:28.640]  lower the carbon footprint and the human population
[1:02:28.640 --> 1:02:31.200]  you tell me that's crazy you tell me that's a dystopia
[1:02:31.200 --> 1:02:34.880]  you tell me that's some type of science fiction comic book
[1:02:34.880 --> 1:02:38.960]  but in reality it really did happen his name is Bill Gates and he's the
[1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:42.400]  head of a major eugenics consortium that his father
[1:02:42.400 --> 1:02:46.880]  and mother set up more than 60 years ago and we're living in this world Bill
[1:02:46.880 --> 1:02:50.720]  Gates is built until we start saying no we are Bill Gates's property
[1:02:50.720 --> 1:02:54.080]  it's time to expose Bill Gates
[1:02:56.240 --> 1:03:02.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:06.240]  you want to stop tyranny well so does he
[1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:09.520]  live from the info wars dot com studios
[1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:18.240]  it's alex jones well i have been
[1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:21.920]  pleased and honored to know robert stone i don't know eight nine years now
[1:03:21.920 --> 1:03:24.160]  met him at a kfk event knew who he was
[1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:28.480]  he was the best selling author knew he worked for nixon reagan and others
[1:03:28.480 --> 1:03:32.720]  then he's worked with him for his correspondence five years off and on
[1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:37.360]  and just done a great job and he joins us right now to look at the
[1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:41.360]  election to look at all the election fraud going on with the democrats to
[1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:44.400]  handicap it to give his view on where trump really is we'll do that next
[1:03:44.400 --> 1:03:46.560]  segment but first thing he wants to get into
[1:03:46.560 --> 1:03:50.160]  is hunter biden and all these massive revelations coming out and where that's
[1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:53.360]  going thank you so much for joining us roger you look great
[1:03:53.360 --> 1:03:57.760]  you look 10 years younger after you got that whole fraudulent
[1:03:57.760 --> 1:04:01.040]  a fake conviction off your back it's clemency not a pardon but
[1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:04.800]  the next best thing and i'm just glad you're back in the fight my friend
[1:04:04.800 --> 1:04:09.760]  well i think jesus christ and and god for that development alex and i'm just
[1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:13.360]  pleased to be with you today through the grace of god
[1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:16.800]  um i must tell you as a political junkie
[1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:21.280]  this is the most interesting volatile and i think different
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:25.120]  election that i've ever had the opportunity to see
[1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:29.760]  um let's start with the polls because it's a good place to start
[1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:32.800]  it's important to recognize that polls are
[1:04:32.800 --> 1:04:38.720]  uh always just a snapshot in time in other words they're not static
[1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:43.520]  they're fluid meaning by the time any pollster gets his
[1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:50.000]  sample tabulated and reported it's already technically obsolete meaning
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:56.480]  voters have moved now what you have here is a situation in which the president's
[1:04:56.480 --> 1:05:00.240]  support has the highest level of intensity
[1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:04.800]  i've ever seen for a republican presidential candidate
[1:05:04.800 --> 1:05:08.720]  and that includes the great ronald reagan uh in the
[1:05:08.720 --> 1:05:12.560]  two national campaigns that i worked on for
[1:05:12.560 --> 1:05:16.720]  governor reagan then president reagan his approval rating
[1:05:16.720 --> 1:05:20.800]  reached the high nineties which we thought was incredible
[1:05:20.800 --> 1:05:24.480]  donald trump's approval rating among his base among
[1:05:24.480 --> 1:05:28.240]  republicans is in the mid nineties i've never
[1:05:28.240 --> 1:05:32.400]  seen that before when you ask trump voters
[1:05:32.400 --> 1:05:35.280]  are you certain that you're going to vote for donald trump
[1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:39.520]  or could you change your mind that number is in the
[1:05:39.520 --> 1:05:44.240]  mid eighties never seen that so unprecedented hard line support i want
[1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:47.760]  to keep breaking down all the numbers clearly the new york times said that
[1:05:47.760 --> 1:05:50.640]  it was a 97 chance hillary would win they would over sample
[1:05:50.640 --> 1:05:56.480]  democrats 10 to 15 points uh i remember four years ago you thought
[1:05:56.480 --> 1:06:00.320]  on air two weeks out that trump was probably going to win but narrowly
[1:06:00.320 --> 1:06:03.760]  uh you ended up being right this time you have privately told me let's just get
[1:06:03.760 --> 1:06:06.720]  it out there that you think he's in trouble
[1:06:06.720 --> 1:06:09.840]  well you know what politics in politics a week
[1:06:09.840 --> 1:06:14.400]  is a lifetime so anything i told you a week ago or two weeks ago
[1:06:14.400 --> 1:06:18.240]  um as ron ziggler once said that is now in operative
[1:06:18.240 --> 1:06:21.840]  um there and i want to be clear you didn't say he was going to lose you said
[1:06:21.840 --> 1:06:25.680]  because the democrats are outspending in five to one and keep battleground states
[1:06:25.680 --> 1:06:29.840]  uh and because the media is lying about him and because of massive election fraud
[1:06:29.840 --> 1:06:32.960]  you thought that might be able to give them the victory but you still were
[1:06:32.960 --> 1:06:36.080]  thinking he's going to win i don't want to mistake you said that's correct the
[1:06:36.080 --> 1:06:40.800]  trend line at that time was not good the good news is that i think the trend line
[1:06:40.800 --> 1:06:44.960]  has changed here's the most significant part of this
[1:06:44.960 --> 1:06:52.080]  if you examine the polls pre-covid-19 pandemic when he was leading
[1:06:52.080 --> 1:06:56.080]  joe biden by 10 and then you examine the polls
[1:06:56.080 --> 1:07:01.280]  post pandemic and you examine which sub voter groups
[1:07:01.280 --> 1:07:05.120]  have moved uh it's interesting virtually every
[1:07:05.120 --> 1:07:10.640]  single voter group remained in place exactly as they were in the first survey
[1:07:10.640 --> 1:07:16.000]  with the exception of african americans and hispanic americans
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:19.360]  prior to the pandemic the president was winning
[1:07:19.360 --> 1:07:23.840]  uh a significantly greater number of those votes
[1:07:23.840 --> 1:07:28.800]  particularly traditionally for a republican uh and was headed towards
[1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:33.760]  doing even better those are the votes that i believe he
[1:07:33.760 --> 1:07:40.880]  temporarily lost post pandemic what does that mean tactically well
[1:07:40.880 --> 1:07:44.880]  if i were running the trump campaign and i am not
[1:07:44.880 --> 1:07:50.000]  i want to stress i have no formal or informal role i am strictly playing the
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:53.440]  part of loyal supporter but if i were running the
[1:07:53.440 --> 1:07:58.640]  trump campaign even if there are cash flow shortages
[1:07:58.640 --> 1:08:04.560]  i would shift money out or out of other endeavors including broadcast television
[1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:08.480]  to this point and put it into hispanic language radio or
[1:08:08.480 --> 1:08:13.520]  spanish language radio in the swing states particularly florida
[1:08:13.520 --> 1:08:17.760]  and i would put it into urban radio stressing
[1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:21.120]  joe biden's role in the 1994 crime bill
[1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:26.640]  where he is the father of the misguided uh current federal drug law
[1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:30.080]  that uh requires the harsh mandatory penalties
[1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:33.280]  for the first time nonviolent crime of possession well i don't think it's
[1:08:33.280 --> 1:08:36.400]  misguided that he and the clinton said that blacks or predators need to be in
[1:08:36.400 --> 1:08:39.840]  prison brought to hill like dogs so on purpose they wanted to lock all the
[1:08:39.840 --> 1:08:42.080]  black people up and now they've been caught and you were
[1:08:42.080 --> 1:08:46.000]  instrumental in getting ads and major stories broken in
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:50.640]  detroit in pennsylvania uh in areas of florida
[1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:53.200]  that are credited that's what the democrats credit you with probably
[1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:55.760]  getting trump elected with all the other work that went on as well but you were a
[1:08:55.760 --> 1:08:58.320]  big part of that and that's just not going on this time you're not
[1:08:58.320 --> 1:09:01.360]  criticizing the campaign but let's just be honest you are really
[1:09:01.360 --> 1:09:05.360]  concerned they're not doing targeted advertising with a group that we have
[1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:09.040]  all this evidence to show him biden's bad and kamala's even worse
[1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:11.920]  she's you know two peas in a pod when it comes to locking up black people for some
[1:09:11.920 --> 1:09:15.200]  reason they have a fetish and so if you have a huge swings of
[1:09:15.200 --> 1:09:19.360]  spanish and blacks towards trump so it's already fertile ground and it's the
[1:09:19.360 --> 1:09:22.560]  truth and you've got biden dead to rights why the hell aren't they doing it
[1:09:22.560 --> 1:09:25.600]  is it just too targeted is it too much work for the campaign to figure that
[1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:29.120]  out i think and this is just an educated
[1:09:29.120 --> 1:09:34.000]  guess the problem is a financial problem but here's the thing about spanish
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:38.400]  language radio particularly in florida uh and urban radio
[1:09:38.400 --> 1:09:43.120]  it's extraordinarily effective it's very good at reaching
[1:09:43.120 --> 1:09:46.720]  precisely those voters you need to reach
[1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:51.040]  it is not inexpensive although it certainly doesn't cost what
[1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:55.200]  say broadcast television does but it's a very pinpointed
[1:09:55.200 --> 1:09:59.280]  effective media by the way you know this you've run a bunch of successful
[1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:02.560]  campaigns at the state level a national level at florida
[1:10:02.560 --> 1:10:06.240]  and you're married to a cuban you know daughter of a famous exile i mean you're
[1:10:06.240 --> 1:10:10.080]  in the cuban community and i noticed on the venezuelan
[1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:14.080]  i mean all of the major hispanic community and i see her shifting towards
[1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:17.200]  trump in florida especially and kind of picking up the understanding of the
[1:10:17.200 --> 1:10:20.960]  cubans because they've seen what happened in venezuela
[1:10:20.960 --> 1:10:25.840]  well i wish it were that simple first of all there was a time in florida where
[1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:30.160]  the cuban american vote was almost monolithically republican
[1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:33.920]  but that was a reflection of the revolution
[1:10:33.920 --> 1:10:39.440]  pulled off by fidel castro today among younger cuban members they don't have
[1:10:39.440 --> 1:10:42.400]  that voters they don't have that frame of
[1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:46.080]  reference they don't have that instinctual
[1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:51.040]  opposition to communism that their parents and grandparents have
[1:10:51.040 --> 1:10:56.960]  so those voters have to be reached you also have to recognize beyond cubans
[1:10:56.960 --> 1:11:00.640]  and venezuelans the largest and fastest growing
[1:11:00.640 --> 1:11:05.440]  of it uh a group of hispanic voters in florida
[1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:09.280]  are portarecans most of whom have migrated here
[1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:13.920]  from new york donald trump does not need to win a majority of the hispanic vote
[1:11:13.920 --> 1:11:16.880]  in florida he just needs to slightly increase his
[1:11:16.880 --> 1:11:20.960]  standing that's actually the key i don't expect him
[1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:25.680]  to win a majority of african-american votes but i have seen polling
[1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:29.120]  not trump campaign polling that shows that when
[1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:32.640]  african-american voters learn of joe biden's
[1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:39.120]  role in the 94 crime bill and his responsibility for the mass incarceration
[1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:42.720]  of hundreds of thousands if not millions by now
[1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:47.280]  of black americans and when they learn about kamala harris's
[1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:53.120]  zeal and enforcing these laws it is a compelling argument for them to
[1:11:53.120 --> 1:11:57.120]  sell that was my next point is not just ads trump what is trump you're doing
[1:11:57.120 --> 1:12:00.400]  that debate tomorrow night i mean he needs to savage biden
[1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:05.840]  for this information doesn't he well to the credit to the president's credit
[1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:09.920]  he did bring it up in the last debate i was cheering when he did
[1:12:09.920 --> 1:12:14.480]  i do think it requires a bit more explanation in other words
[1:12:14.480 --> 1:12:17.840]  when the president said to joe biden your treatment of african-americans has
[1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:21.680]  been disgraceful you've treated them horribly that's 100
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:25.040]  correct but i think the president needs to just spell it
[1:12:25.040 --> 1:12:29.040]  out a bit more uh there's a lot riding on this debate
[1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:32.800]  that's one of the other reasons why i'm growingly optimistic
[1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:37.040]  because the president now has a wealth of opportunities
[1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:39.920]  to go on okay great because i talked to you a week ago and you weren't ready to
[1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:42.400]  come on and you were a little bit bummed out you said he could lose it but now
[1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:45.120]  you're saying momentum is in trump's direction so
[1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:47.760]  i really respect your view i'm very very excited to hear that
[1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:50.640]  roger stone is our guest with right back to talk about the debate tomorrow night
[1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:56.160]  it's taken me two and a half years to finally even be able to convince congress
[1:12:56.160 --> 1:12:59.840]  and the rest of the world that we were only the initial target
[1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:03.520]  to set the precedent for a coordinated big tech censorship
[1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:08.080]  now the world finally understands it but we don't have two and a half years
[1:13:08.080 --> 1:13:12.320]  for the learning curve to take place this time bill gates and the u n are on
[1:13:12.320 --> 1:13:17.600]  record saying the lockdown is permanent it is a plan to lower carbon
[1:13:17.600 --> 1:13:20.720]  footprint it is a plan to make the world population
[1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:25.840]  poor it is a diabolical power grab it is a revolution against the industrial
[1:13:25.840 --> 1:13:29.040]  revolution they call it the post-industrial world
[1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:32.560]  and it's the excuse for them to take control every fast of our lives
[1:13:32.560 --> 1:13:36.400]  and implement absolute authoritarianism so again to everybody out there if you
[1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:39.440]  love your children by my daughter that just woke up here
[1:13:39.440 --> 1:13:43.120]  and if you care about yourselves in any future you need to get awake
[1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:46.720]  you need to understand this information you've warned others okay it's a life and
[1:13:46.720 --> 1:13:50.240]  death situation
[1:13:50.240 --> 1:13:54.080]  cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left
[1:13:54.080 --> 1:13:58.400]  it can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept
[1:13:58.400 --> 1:14:02.800]  if you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition
[1:14:02.800 --> 1:14:07.280]  buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarsstore.com
[1:14:07.280 --> 1:14:11.440]  studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation
[1:14:11.440 --> 1:14:15.600]  can slightly lower blood pressure decrease triglyceride levels
[1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:19.840]  decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in
[1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:23.920]  inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system
[1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:28.880]  recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil
[1:14:28.880 --> 1:14:33.040]  can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:37.040]  and activity of immune cells it worked for my family
[1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:40.880]  and now i can have a logical and calm discussion about
[1:14:40.880 --> 1:14:46.160]  actual facts that pertain to reality get your ultimate fish oil for a friend
[1:14:46.160 --> 1:14:51.680]  family member or yourself at infowarsstore.com
[1:14:51.680 --> 1:15:09.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:15:14.240 --> 1:15:18.560]  waging war on corruption crashing the lies and disinformation
[1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:22.480]  i am your host alex jones and roger stone is here with us
[1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:29.040]  it was three years and three hundred something days ago
[1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:33.360]  that he was here in studio as we famously
[1:15:33.360 --> 1:15:37.120]  clicked our glasses together of champagne when donald trump
[1:15:37.120 --> 1:15:40.080]  was announced the winner hillary refused to officially concede herself
[1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:43.440]  reportedly got totally drunk and through fits i hope to be having that
[1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:45.840]  celebration again maybe even roger will be with us
[1:15:45.840 --> 1:15:49.360]  here in studio now that he is a free man
[1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:52.560]  continue with the polls continue with what you see right now with
[1:15:52.560 --> 1:15:55.840]  president trump of this election with your honest expert analysis now you
[1:15:55.840 --> 1:15:59.360]  want to get a hunter biden and how big this laptop is and the new revelation
[1:15:59.360 --> 1:16:03.920]  it's roger stone and of course the website is stonefamilysupportfund.com
[1:16:03.920 --> 1:16:08.160]  he spent his whole fortune sold his house everything
[1:16:08.160 --> 1:16:11.600]  in that long three-year persecution that's why it's important to support
[1:16:11.600 --> 1:16:14.640]  those who have kept the fight going i want to thank you all for your
[1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:17.760]  support roger stone stonefamilysupportfund.com
[1:16:17.760 --> 1:16:20.400]  you can also go to his website and find some of his great
[1:16:20.400 --> 1:16:23.840]  roger stone did nothing wrong shirts that are historic all right roger
[1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:26.800]  continue getting into the current polls
[1:16:26.800 --> 1:16:30.640]  well alex you're exactly right a couple weeks ago i was
[1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:34.560]  very concerned about the direction of the race
[1:16:34.560 --> 1:16:38.640]  today i would describe myself as growingly optimistic
[1:16:38.640 --> 1:16:42.160]  there's a couple reasons for that first of all
[1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:46.320]  i still believe donald trump may be the single best communicator
[1:16:46.320 --> 1:16:50.080]  and campaigner in republican party history
[1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:53.600]  the trump roadshow is something to behold
[1:16:53.600 --> 1:16:57.600]  voters turn out by the hundreds of thousands because trump is
[1:16:57.600 --> 1:17:02.800]  interesting he's pugnacious he is straight to the point
[1:17:02.800 --> 1:17:07.280]  he's entertaining and he's a counterpuncher
[1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:13.360]  joe biden is not capable of of of maintaining any kind of a rigorous
[1:17:13.360 --> 1:17:20.320]  campaign schedule and let's face it he's boring on the stump
[1:17:20.320 --> 1:17:24.880]  so you have that you also have the fact that
[1:17:24.880 --> 1:17:31.760]  these new hunter biden revelations could be the so-called
[1:17:31.760 --> 1:17:39.360]  october surprise now i give a former mayor rudy juliani enormous credit
[1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:43.520]  because as i understand it hunter biden
[1:17:43.520 --> 1:17:47.200]  turned his computer over to a repair shop in delaware
[1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:51.760]  he signed a contract that said if he did not collect it within 90 days the
[1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:55.920]  ownership would revert to the owner of the shop
[1:17:55.920 --> 1:18:01.600]  he did not collect his uh his laptop based on what i understand
[1:18:01.600 --> 1:18:06.160]  he looked at it he was appalled he sent it to the fbi
[1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:09.600]  six months went by and he heard nothing whatsoever
[1:18:09.600 --> 1:18:14.880]  fearing a cover-up i'm totally reached out to a number of prominent republicans
[1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:21.840]  but only mayor juliani responded then mayor juliani sent a very heavy duty
[1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:25.280]  attorney a former assistant us attorney former
[1:18:25.280 --> 1:18:31.760]  head of the criminal division at the doj to delaware to inspect uh and authenticate
[1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:35.440]  the computer they spent almost a week doing that
[1:18:35.440 --> 1:18:41.680]  it was then and only then uh that mayor juliani made this information public
[1:18:41.680 --> 1:18:46.800]  uh it is amazing to me to watch the new york times go through contortions
[1:18:46.800 --> 1:18:51.200]  along with the rest of them abc nbc cbs uh
[1:18:51.200 --> 1:18:56.560]  arguing about the province the the source of the of these laptops they
[1:18:56.560 --> 1:18:59.040]  didn't seem to be too concerned about the source
[1:18:59.040 --> 1:19:02.640]  or the authenticity of donald trump's tax returns
[1:19:02.640 --> 1:19:06.320]  when they posted them on page one uh it is such a
[1:19:06.320 --> 1:19:10.080]  phony narrative well we're not going to cover this
[1:19:10.080 --> 1:19:16.320]  because we doubt uh the veracity oh they let buzzfeed put out that
[1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:19.440]  hookers or where we're peeing on the president it's just absolutely
[1:19:19.440 --> 1:19:23.120]  ridiculous and it's really woken people up finally the censorship i think the
[1:19:23.120 --> 1:19:26.640]  worms starting to turn though on big tech censorship
[1:19:26.640 --> 1:19:30.080]  i agree with you on that then yesterday
[1:19:30.080 --> 1:19:34.240]  they rolled out uh the biggest buffoon they have
[1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:39.680]  john brennan a man who declassified documents now proved it beyond a shadow
[1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:44.240]  of doubt engaged in various illegal activities and
[1:19:44.240 --> 1:19:49.360]  hid evidence of hillary clinton's involvement with the russians while
[1:19:49.360 --> 1:19:52.800]  falsely accusing donald trump of being involved
[1:19:52.800 --> 1:19:57.200]  with the russians uh and fifty other neocon
[1:19:57.200 --> 1:20:01.920]  former intelligence types who say without inspecting any of the material
[1:20:01.920 --> 1:20:06.240]  oh this has all the earmarks of russian disinformation
[1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:10.000]  that is nonsense in fact the fbi
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:15.680]  and the department of justice have now verified the authenticity
[1:20:15.680 --> 1:20:19.600]  nice talk nice try john nice try that's going nowhere
[1:20:19.600 --> 1:20:24.960]  um this is by the way exactly the tact that joe biden started this morning
[1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:29.760]  every important intelligence official in the country says these emails are
[1:20:29.760 --> 1:20:33.360]  fraudulent no joe just john brennan in a hand
[1:20:33.360 --> 1:20:40.080]  uh a handful of his groupies say that uh i i believe mayor juliani i think he's
[1:20:40.080 --> 1:20:44.080]  been very effective and very articulate uh in his
[1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:47.840]  presentation and his outlay regarding both the
[1:20:47.840 --> 1:20:51.520]  province and the condom i totally agree and i want to talk about from your
[1:20:51.520 --> 1:20:55.040]  sources bomb shells more bomb shells coming that's my
[1:20:55.040 --> 1:20:57.280]  next question but since you mentioned it here's
[1:20:57.280 --> 1:21:00.960]  biden this morning saying oh all the intel officials including or no no
[1:21:00.960 --> 1:21:04.320]  fifty democrat party operatives admitted they have no evidence
[1:21:04.320 --> 1:21:07.120]  but the actual director of national intelligence said this is totally real
[1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:10.160]  it's from his laptop shop they're not even denying it's real so they're in a
[1:21:10.160 --> 1:21:16.480]  lot of trouble here's the clip so wisconsin's republican senator
[1:21:16.480 --> 1:21:20.400]  ron johnson put out a statement on homeland security letterhead
[1:21:20.400 --> 1:21:24.000]  saying hunter biden together with other biden family members profited off the
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:28.480]  biden name is there any legitimacy to senator johnson's claims
[1:21:28.480 --> 1:21:35.440]  none whatsoever this is the same garbage rudy juliani trump henchman
[1:21:35.440 --> 1:21:40.080]  it's the last it's effort in this desperate campaign to smear me and my family
[1:21:40.080 --> 1:21:42.880]  even the man who served with him on that committee
[1:21:42.880 --> 1:21:48.640]  the former nominee for the republican party said there's no basis to this and
[1:21:48.640 --> 1:21:52.480]  you know and all and the vast majority of the intelligence people have come out
[1:21:52.480 --> 1:21:56.000]  and said there's no basis at all ron
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:59.200]  well they've really screwed the poochier haven't they because they're saying all
[1:21:59.200 --> 1:22:02.960]  these other laptops are coming out they've contacted people on the laptop
[1:22:02.960 --> 1:22:06.800]  with their emails confirmed it's real they're meeting with new fbi
[1:22:06.800 --> 1:22:10.160]  groups not not the phony investigation it was done i mean
[1:22:10.160 --> 1:22:14.080]  joe biden and his son hunter have got to be sweating bullets not to mention the
[1:22:14.080 --> 1:22:17.280]  barisma emails they're like we're going to give me the 30 million but you got it
[1:22:17.280 --> 1:22:21.200]  in the investigation then they have his dad on c span admitting he into the
[1:22:21.200 --> 1:22:25.440]  investigation i mean this is crazy how obvious this is
[1:22:25.440 --> 1:22:30.160]  well and if joe biden was road testing that response for this week's debate i
[1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:33.520]  can tell him right now it's not going to work
[1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:37.360]  he is incredibly busted let's let's remember what he said
[1:22:37.360 --> 1:22:41.440]  he knew nothing about hunters uh business enterprises
[1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:44.960]  he had no meetings pertaining to the mean nothing about it
[1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:48.320]  just on that basis he has lied to the american people
[1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:54.320]  of the attempts to suppress this news uh by the mainstream media outlets are
[1:22:54.320 --> 1:22:57.760]  unlike anything i have seen in a 40 year career
[1:22:57.760 --> 1:23:01.120]  in american politics uh but you know how america
[1:23:01.120 --> 1:23:04.560]  works the more you tell people oh no you can't see this
[1:23:04.560 --> 1:23:08.400]  the more curious they are to see it and make a judgment
[1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:12.560]  for themselves i really think this issue is devastating
[1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:16.560]  because it speaks both directly to joe biden's credibility
[1:23:16.560 --> 1:23:23.200]  and his integrity and quite obviously the undue influence that the chinese
[1:23:23.200 --> 1:23:28.400]  would have under over him were he to become president of the united states
[1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:31.920]  when we come back we'll talk about from your sources and other sources we have
[1:23:31.920 --> 1:23:34.880]  what's on the laptop and more about to come out
[1:23:34.880 --> 1:23:38.000]  then we'll look more at election fraud with this new shocking video that just
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:42.080]  went live at info wars dot com and bandot video uh there in
[1:23:42.080 --> 1:23:45.200]  maryland german town where it looks like they're
[1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:49.520]  messing with the balance and marking them which is illegal vitamin mineral
[1:23:49.520 --> 1:23:54.720]  infusion and ultra 12 are now back in stock after being sold out for months
[1:23:54.720 --> 1:23:58.320]  they're sold out because people know that high quality b12 and a good mix of
[1:23:58.320 --> 1:24:03.040]  vitamins minerals especially zinc boost your body's natural defenses and are
[1:24:03.040 --> 1:24:07.200]  critical to your immune system well both products are back
[1:24:07.200 --> 1:24:11.120]  in stock at infowarstore.com just two weeks after the election

[1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:25.520]  the things we're selling lost leaders now we have had a big clearance sale
[1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:27.760]  going so a lot of stuff sold out while the other
[1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:30.880]  stuff is close to selling out but some of our best sellers are still there
[1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:34.320]  and some of them have actually come back in to stock and because of your support
[1:24:34.320 --> 1:24:37.120]  we've had the money to reorder and get the other
[1:24:37.120 --> 1:24:40.080]  things that have actually sold out so those should be back in stock as well
[1:24:40.080 --> 1:24:42.560]  soon thank you so much for keeping info wars on the
[1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:45.840]  year obviously we're critical to fight and you've helped win the war against
[1:24:45.840 --> 1:24:48.640]  the global so far
[1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:52.640]  finally the stagnant republican establishment
[1:24:52.640 --> 1:24:56.400]  understands what info wars understands what our listeners understand
[1:24:56.400 --> 1:25:00.160]  what donald trump understands we're in a digital
[1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:05.200]  civil war there are giant filters filtering out 99 percent of communication
[1:25:05.200 --> 1:25:10.320]  going on on every major tech platform and now they're doing it to the
[1:25:10.320 --> 1:25:14.160]  private apps they're doing it to text messages they're doing it to email
[1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:17.680]  this is mafia organized crime election meddling
[1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:21.760]  but finally when they blocked the hunter biden and the barisma
[1:25:21.760 --> 1:25:25.440]  information and the chinese information and the photos and the
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:28.640]  crack pipes and all the rest of it has been confirmed to be real
[1:25:28.640 --> 1:25:32.560]  biden hasn't denied it finally congress got pissed and said this is out of
[1:25:32.560 --> 1:25:35.600]  control you've got to stop it now we're taking action oh
[1:25:35.600 --> 1:25:38.880]  injectors you went oh what's the mistake it's an accident it's an accident
[1:25:38.880 --> 1:25:42.640]  but they keep pushing and pushing because no one ever calls their bluff
[1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:46.000]  well info wars is calling their bluff and i want to thank you all for keeping us

[1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:25.440]  overrode them four years ago trump has finally figured this out since he's
[1:26:25.440 --> 1:26:28.320]  going to take action once reelected against big tech
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:31.280]  i mean he's modern situation well we know the president's overwhelmed right
[1:26:31.280 --> 1:26:34.240]  now so we're going to sit here and cry because he has taken action

[1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:23.840]  and news wars.com and banned on video we're going back to roger stone
[1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:28.400]  in a moment former top advisor to the presidential campaign of donald trump the
[1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:32.400]  guy that introduced him the idea of running the president more than 43 years
[1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:35.360]  ago he is here with us and i want to get into the
[1:27:35.360 --> 1:27:39.280]  election meddling the censorship uh the internet kill switch are basically
[1:27:39.280 --> 1:27:43.120]  already implementing which i've discovered this is exclusive uh with
[1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:46.560]  roger stone on a finish up on the hunter biden
[1:27:46.560 --> 1:27:50.880]  the word bombshell gets overused this is just as roger said he's been involved
[1:27:50.880 --> 1:27:54.160]  in politics since i guess the 50s or whatever and
[1:27:54.160 --> 1:27:57.360]  however many campaigns that is he's never seen anything
[1:27:57.360 --> 1:28:00.960]  like this i mean this is and the media covering it up
[1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:04.160]  is incredible and the censorship is really woke people up so
[1:28:04.160 --> 1:28:07.280]  it's quite a time to be alive as things come to a head
[1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:12.000]  as they say separately i've told you that we have real trouble
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:15.920]  getting the supplements from the high quality big manufacturers we use
[1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:20.320]  because things have broken down with the covet 19 economic war
[1:28:20.320 --> 1:28:25.760]  and so it took us 14 weeks instead of the usual six weeks to get vitamin
[1:28:25.760 --> 1:28:29.360]  mineral fusion back in we already already had it pre-order
[1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:32.800]  and because of finance issues i put in a small order of it
[1:28:32.800 --> 1:28:36.080]  it's going to be sold out now in like 10 days at current order rates
[1:28:36.080 --> 1:28:39.280]  all the vitamins all the minerals so good for your immune system for adults
[1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:42.880]  and children it tastes great it's healthy everybody's getting it it's
[1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:45.920]  essential unfortunately it's going to be sold out soon
[1:28:45.920 --> 1:28:48.560]  then we're trying to fund ourselves but i would take advantage and get that
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:52.880]  right now we're still discounting it 50 off of free shipping
[1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:55.920]  and triple patriot points but i'm going to end that sale in a couple days because
[1:28:55.920 --> 1:28:59.280]  we're not going to have more i learned till maybe the new year
[1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:02.880]  so what a bummer also ultra 12 so good for immune system your body's
[1:29:02.880 --> 1:29:06.000]  defenses high quality b12 highest quality under the tongue
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  that's 50 off infowarstore.com we're selling out of dna4 still discounted

[1:29:27.200 --> 1:29:31.200]  products infowarstore.com and while you're at it get
[1:29:31.200 --> 1:29:34.800]  a t-shirt to fund the operation because uh again i want to thank you for keeping
[1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:39.040]  us on air under all these attacks but it is neck and neck here what's
[1:29:39.040 --> 1:29:42.400]  going to happen next year because i i want trump to get elected
[1:29:42.400 --> 1:29:45.200]  but if trump gets elected people are going to go back to sleep we'll even have
[1:29:45.200 --> 1:29:48.800]  less support which is fine but if the biden gets elected to try
[1:29:48.800 --> 1:29:52.640]  he's gonna probably have us arrested i mean so we want trump elected regardless
[1:29:52.640 --> 1:29:58.160]  i don't i don't support you know uh getting trump in uh
[1:29:58.160 --> 1:30:03.600]  for how it affects our operation here uh the media lied and said jones is upset
[1:30:03.600 --> 1:30:07.120]  the night of the election uh because trump won he wanted hillary to be
[1:30:07.120 --> 1:30:10.160]  elected no hillary would have had a shutdown arrested i wanted trump
[1:30:10.160 --> 1:30:14.880]  elected i got depressed on election night because i knew
[1:30:14.880 --> 1:30:18.080]  they were coming after us and i don't want to my horn
[1:30:18.080 --> 1:30:20.880]  but i want to go back to that night four years ago roger
[1:30:20.880 --> 1:30:24.400]  and i want to ask you before we get back into the hunter biden stuff
[1:30:24.400 --> 1:30:28.320]  what do you expect to happen if trump loses versus trump wins
[1:30:28.320 --> 1:30:31.200]  not and of course regardless the democrats have said
[1:30:31.200 --> 1:30:35.040]  they are going to contest the election when they lose
[1:30:35.040 --> 1:30:38.080]  and try to break the country up so that's never before been seen i mean this
[1:30:38.080 --> 1:30:43.840]  is really the battle of the gods about to go down
[1:30:43.840 --> 1:30:48.000]  well alex first of all we have made it a practice in 40 years in american
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:52.240]  politics not to answer hypothetical questions
[1:30:52.240 --> 1:30:57.920]  before we wrap up on the last topic again i want to give bare juliani enormous
[1:30:57.920 --> 1:31:03.040]  credit for bringing this information out i find it kind of amusing
[1:31:03.040 --> 1:31:06.400]  that out of the blue steve bannon is trying to
[1:31:06.400 --> 1:31:11.200]  take credit for these devastating releases this is of course the same
[1:31:11.200 --> 1:31:14.640]  steve bannon who said donald trump junior was a russian
[1:31:14.640 --> 1:31:17.840]  trader that the trump organization was a criminal
[1:31:17.840 --> 1:31:21.600]  enterprise the same steve bannon who testified
[1:31:21.600 --> 1:31:26.320]  falsely at my trial which is indisputed when you compare
[1:31:26.320 --> 1:31:30.320]  his sworn testimony to his testimony under oath
[1:31:30.320 --> 1:31:33.680]  before the house intelligents because no one was giving him credit involved
[1:31:33.680 --> 1:31:35.840]  earlier but setting like a pig at the trough
[1:31:35.840 --> 1:31:39.760]  he inserted himself exactly what he appears
[1:31:39.760 --> 1:31:44.320]  to be doing look i've known rudy juliani i think 25 years
[1:31:44.320 --> 1:31:47.840]  he's a very serious lawyer and prosecutor
[1:31:47.840 --> 1:31:51.680]  he he does his due diligence before he goes forward
[1:31:51.680 --> 1:31:57.440]  on anything he's extraordinarily cautious but he's also extraordinarily
[1:31:57.440 --> 1:32:01.840]  knowledgeable and therefore that gives this entire thing
[1:32:01.840 --> 1:32:09.040]  additional credibility in my view this debate coming up thursday night
[1:32:09.040 --> 1:32:12.720]  has the same problems uh as the first debate
[1:32:12.720 --> 1:32:16.320]  the same problems as the second debate
[1:32:16.320 --> 1:32:20.240]  would have had i wrote a piece for the spectator telling the president
[1:32:20.240 --> 1:32:24.400]  he should duck the miami debate because the format was unfair
[1:32:24.400 --> 1:32:28.000]  the moderator was in the tank he had worked for
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:31.360]  joe biden okay this is so important roger let me respectfully give you the
[1:32:31.360 --> 1:32:33.760]  floor for a 10 and a half minute segment the long
[1:32:33.760 --> 1:32:37.040]  segment next segment but in the five minutes we have left
[1:32:37.040 --> 1:32:40.720]  let's get into that net because the trump gets your reports here we know a
[1:32:40.720 --> 1:32:44.160]  lot of the time there's secret services sir when he's on a plane
[1:32:44.160 --> 1:32:47.360]  roger wants to talk to you people respect you we found that
[1:32:47.360 --> 1:32:50.480]  sometimes if i have a message he gets to trump that with you it pretty much
[1:32:50.480 --> 1:32:54.080]  always gets to him so let's give you the floor to host the next segment
[1:32:54.080 --> 1:32:57.520]  your messages to trump about the debate the campaign everything you want to
[1:32:57.520 --> 1:33:00.240]  say but let's just get back to the hunter biden
[1:33:00.240 --> 1:33:04.560]  thing and then censorship um i i have no
[1:33:04.560 --> 1:33:09.360]  inside information on what else is to come other than i am told by credible
[1:33:09.360 --> 1:33:12.240]  sources that it's devastating that it's
[1:33:12.240 --> 1:33:15.600]  extraordinary i'm not like steve bannon i'm not
[1:33:15.600 --> 1:33:19.120]  going to claim that i know something that i don't know
[1:33:19.120 --> 1:33:23.200]  but just what we do know already is enough to
[1:33:23.200 --> 1:33:27.840]  royal this election if it gets sufficient coverage
[1:33:27.840 --> 1:33:30.880]  thursday night's debate is going to give the president
[1:33:30.880 --> 1:33:35.600]  a bully pulpit to lay this out for the american people
[1:33:35.600 --> 1:33:38.480]  the other thing though and i think this is crucial
[1:33:38.480 --> 1:33:42.240]  some weeks ago your friend joe rogan invited
[1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:45.120]  donald trump and joe biden to a four-hour debate
[1:33:45.120 --> 1:33:49.920]  on his podcast the president immediately accepted
[1:33:49.920 --> 1:33:53.440]  there was nothing but deafening silence from joe biden
[1:33:53.440 --> 1:33:58.800]  the president should pummel biden every day to have the courage have the guts
[1:33:58.800 --> 1:34:02.800]  to go on that debate with joe rogan joe rogan would be
[1:34:02.800 --> 1:34:07.600]  an ideal moderator he's not in the tank for anyone
[1:34:07.600 --> 1:34:11.600]  it would be an extraordinary political development personally
[1:34:11.600 --> 1:34:14.880]  i don't think joe biden can stand up for four hours
[1:34:14.880 --> 1:34:19.520]  uh but the president should this isn't over just because thursday has a debate
[1:34:19.520 --> 1:34:23.680]  doesn't mean we can't have another debate next week the week before
[1:34:23.680 --> 1:34:27.120]  the election roger you need to fly to austin because i spent 45 minutes on the
[1:34:27.120 --> 1:34:30.560]  phone with joe rogan last night his offices are right down the street from
[1:34:30.560 --> 1:34:33.360]  me and we were basically having a discussion about
[1:34:33.360 --> 1:34:37.520]  something just like what you're debating right now so it's definitely the zeitgeist
[1:34:37.520 --> 1:34:43.600]  is uh activated uh again uh the more debates the
[1:34:43.600 --> 1:34:48.480]  better why because it breaks through the fake news media
[1:34:48.480 --> 1:34:51.680]  blockade regarding the hunter biden
[1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:56.320]  revelations uh so i would if i were the president i would be calling joe
[1:34:56.320 --> 1:35:01.520]  biden out relentlessly for another debate by the way the polling also shows
[1:35:01.520 --> 1:35:04.720]  the voters will hold it against a candidate
[1:35:04.720 --> 1:35:09.520]  who refuses to debate we're now at a point in american history
[1:35:09.520 --> 1:35:13.760]  where voters expect a debate they believe they
[1:35:13.760 --> 1:35:18.720]  deserve an open and fair and free debate between the candidates
[1:35:18.720 --> 1:35:23.440]  the commission on presidential debates is not a commission not appointed by the
[1:35:23.440 --> 1:35:28.480]  president and it's about limiting debates i'm concerned about those cutoff
[1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:31.600]  switches that i understand have been installed for the debate
[1:35:31.600 --> 1:35:35.920]  thursday night it would be a big mistake for anybody to cut off
[1:35:35.920 --> 1:35:39.840]  the president of the united states when he's trying to make a fair and
[1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:43.520]  salient point well it's just unprecedented as you said to be
[1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:46.080]  censoring him on twitter censoring him on facebook
[1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:50.640]  censoring the campaign and and now the lady they've picked as an anti-trumper
[1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:53.680]  kill switches are not going to allow foreign affairs to be discussed
[1:35:53.680 --> 1:35:57.200]  because usually the third debate as you know is about that and that's trump
[1:35:57.200 --> 1:36:00.480]  strong suit with all the great things he's done i mean i agree with you i think
[1:36:00.480 --> 1:36:04.960]  you shouldn't go to it then what should he do roger just have his own big rally
[1:36:04.960 --> 1:36:08.960]  uh and and and just sit there and just lay out the facts
[1:36:08.960 --> 1:36:12.480]  well if he has to of course he could debate an empty chair
[1:36:12.480 --> 1:36:17.040]  or he could get somebody to stand in and play the role of joe biden
[1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:22.400]  if he could find somebody uh that out of it you just gave me a great idea
[1:36:22.400 --> 1:36:26.320]  alex i'm going to post a petition this afternoon
[1:36:26.320 --> 1:36:31.200]  demanding that joe biden agree to joe rogan's debate invitation
[1:36:31.200 --> 1:36:34.640]  i think that that could be the crucial turning point
[1:36:34.640 --> 1:36:40.320]  in this presidential election rogan is fair he'd be a perfect moderator i don't
[1:36:40.320 --> 1:36:44.560]  think both pydons got the the whole maybe i should call joe right now he
[1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:47.200]  always answers i'm just going to give him a call
[1:36:47.200 --> 1:36:51.840]  i've got some really important and quite frankly bad news for you
[1:36:51.840 --> 1:36:55.200]  we've confirmed from high-level sources in our own research that if joe biden
[1:36:55.200 --> 1:36:57.520]  is able to steal the election and they're going to really try to do it they're
[1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:00.480]  that crazy they intend to not just shut down
[1:37:00.480 --> 1:37:03.280]  info wars but have yours truly alex shows arrested
[1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:06.560]  and here's the really bad news they're coming after everybody and they're
[1:37:06.560 --> 1:37:09.440]  coming after the economy and they want to totally gut it
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:13.440]  and punish americans for supporting donald trump and repudiating hollywood
[1:37:13.440 --> 1:37:16.240]  and all the trash but here's the really good news
[1:37:16.240 --> 1:37:20.080]  the really good news humanity is awakening to this threat
[1:37:20.080 --> 1:37:24.400]  we're no longer asleep and we understand that the globals are immortal
[1:37:24.400 --> 1:37:27.680]  enemies and we fundamentally understand that they're trying to end our nation

[1:38:48.080 --> 1:38:51.760]  a major life lesson just took place last night
[1:38:51.760 --> 1:38:55.440]  the top story in the country was that hunter biden's
[1:38:55.440 --> 1:38:58.960]  laptop information had come out him with
[1:38:58.960 --> 1:39:04.160]  hookers and shooting porno movies and crack pipes but the real news
[1:39:04.160 --> 1:39:07.600]  was how he had indeed been bought off by barisma
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:11.280]  and had done so at the behest of his father who was getting large parts
[1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:15.760]  of the money but you see twitter and facebook and others totally censored
[1:39:15.760 --> 1:39:18.640]  info and even censored major news publications
[1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:21.680]  and even censored the president but when the president and congress said
[1:39:21.680 --> 1:39:25.680]  they were going to take action suddenly jack of twitter said he
[1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:28.080]  didn't know what had happened and it was wrong
[1:39:28.080 --> 1:39:32.080]  and that's the big life lesson here standing up and saying no to organized
[1:39:32.080 --> 1:39:35.680]  crime rapid caring is the way to stop it
[1:39:35.680 --> 1:39:39.600]  groveling to it and letting big tech lie to us and run over us is the way to make
[1:39:39.600 --> 1:39:42.400]  these tyrants continue to go absolutely crazy
[1:39:42.400 --> 1:39:45.440]  remember they support communist china and its death camps

[1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:25.920]  12 days out to president trump well again the single most important
[1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:30.000]  votes right now the votes that seem to be most in play
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:34.560]  where the president through just a incremental increase in his current
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:39.200]  percentage could swing virtually every one of these
[1:42:39.200 --> 1:42:45.680]  swing states are both african americans uh and hispanic americans
[1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:50.160]  uh remember this is the president that gave us the highest level
[1:42:50.160 --> 1:42:54.160]  of black employment in american history uh and the
[1:42:54.160 --> 1:43:01.200]  older hispanic voters tend to be social conservatives pro-life but they're also
[1:43:01.200 --> 1:43:05.840]  extremely entrepreneurial economic opportunity will flow
[1:43:05.840 --> 1:43:10.480]  through the policies of donald trump not the high tax more
[1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:16.480]  regulation policies uh of joe biden again i would shift
[1:43:16.480 --> 1:43:22.320]  resources out of other areas including broadcast tv at this point
[1:43:22.320 --> 1:43:27.040]  to pinpoint those key voters through uh radio
[1:43:27.040 --> 1:43:32.560]  specialized radio urban radio hispanic radio gospel radio even christian
[1:43:32.560 --> 1:43:37.120]  radio uh in the swing states uh i think the president should
[1:43:37.120 --> 1:43:41.920]  continue to pound on joe biden for yet another debate and as i made it
[1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:46.880]  clear i think joe rogan is the perfect moderator the other
[1:43:46.880 --> 1:43:52.080]  observation i would make is that the president has a secret weapon actually
[1:43:52.080 --> 1:43:55.680]  three of them his son donald jr his other son
[1:43:55.680 --> 1:44:00.480]  eric and his daughter avanca trump each of one of them
[1:44:00.480 --> 1:44:04.000]  in their own right is an extraordinarily capable
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:08.240]  uh campaigner and they have hit the trail very hard
[1:44:08.240 --> 1:44:11.200]  hunter biden i don't think will be doing any
[1:44:11.200 --> 1:44:17.920]  campaign appearances anytime soon uh beyond that uh the president i also
[1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:23.760]  think needs to boil these issues down and frame a
[1:44:23.760 --> 1:44:28.480]  question for the american people here's the question based on all the polling
[1:44:28.480 --> 1:44:33.920]  that i have seen uh because of the covet 19 pandemic
[1:44:33.920 --> 1:44:37.840]  uh in an act of caution an abundance of caution
[1:44:37.840 --> 1:44:41.440]  the president's not a doctor he's not a scientist
[1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:45.280]  he had no choice but to protect the public safety
[1:44:45.280 --> 1:44:51.120]  by closing america's economy down thank god the draconian projections of the
[1:44:51.120 --> 1:44:56.000]  scientists turned out to be wrong and then they tried to fool the president
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:45:01.120]  into shutting the economy a second time and he wisely refused
[1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:06.080]  now the question is who better to rebuild america's economy
[1:45:06.080 --> 1:45:09.760]  a man who has already proven indisputably
[1:45:09.760 --> 1:45:14.400]  that he knows exactly how to do it a president who got us
[1:45:14.400 --> 1:45:20.800]  record wage growth record job growth a record levels of employment among
[1:45:20.800 --> 1:45:24.400]  all subgroups of americans black white
[1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:28.320]  asian men women and so on or joe biden
[1:45:28.320 --> 1:45:33.280]  whose prescription of higher taxes he makes no bones about that
[1:45:33.280 --> 1:45:36.560]  more regulation uh and more of these big
[1:45:36.560 --> 1:45:43.600]  omnibus one size fits all trade deals that donald trump has wisely killed
[1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:48.480]  is going to take a sick economy uh and make it even sicker
[1:45:48.480 --> 1:45:52.960]  that is the choice for americans those african americans
[1:45:52.960 --> 1:45:57.280]  and hispanic americans who were in the polls
[1:45:57.280 --> 1:46:03.520]  voting for donald trump uh pre-pandemic were doing so for economic reasons
[1:46:03.520 --> 1:46:06.720]  those votes in my opinion can be gotten back
[1:46:06.720 --> 1:46:10.080]  they're clearly open to voting for trump because they were
[1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:16.800]  voting for him at one time so we now get down to the narrow casting
[1:46:16.800 --> 1:46:23.440]  part of this election um again remember the last three weeks
[1:46:23.440 --> 1:46:27.600]  of the 2016 campaign when hillary clinton was
[1:46:27.600 --> 1:46:34.080]  closeted in chapecois actively picking out the fabric for the curtains in the
[1:46:34.080 --> 1:46:37.120]  oval office well donald trump was doing five
[1:46:37.120 --> 1:46:40.400]  campaign stops a day and he's doing it again
[1:46:40.400 --> 1:46:44.160]  donald trump is getting by on two three hours sleep a night
[1:46:44.160 --> 1:46:47.360]  barnstorming in the democratic strongholds of
[1:46:47.360 --> 1:46:53.520]  detroit milwaukee richmond miami fort lauderdale cleveland
[1:46:53.520 --> 1:46:57.600]  you can expect him to outwork the opposition again
[1:46:57.600 --> 1:47:02.000]  biden cannot keep up with that pace donald trump
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:07.760]  loves the battle he's a brawler you can see how the clouds bring him alive he
[1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:12.720]  actually enjoys uh campaigning and he's going to close
[1:47:12.720 --> 1:47:17.200]  fast here and win this election i'm beginning to become
[1:47:17.200 --> 1:47:21.440]  increasingly optimistic but we need to hammer
[1:47:21.440 --> 1:47:27.920]  every day on making sure that the true accurate information regarding
[1:47:27.920 --> 1:47:31.440]  the misconduct of hunter biden and his father
[1:47:31.440 --> 1:47:38.640]  get through to the american people beautifully said roger stone um
[1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:41.840]  what about the ace in the hole they we have our ace in the hole the people
[1:47:41.840 --> 1:47:44.800]  they're awake they're coming together black hispanic voters are waking up
[1:47:44.800 --> 1:47:48.480]  they know they're being manipulated by democrats but their ace in the hole is
[1:47:48.480 --> 1:47:52.000]  big tech unified censorship censoring everybody now
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:55.920]  dialing everybody down to nothing or outright banning on my son rex band last
[1:47:55.920 --> 1:47:59.360]  week on twitter for no reason promoting a trump tweet
[1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:02.480]  this is this is here this is happening they haven't gotten in trouble
[1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:05.520]  and the democrats are going to say they can test
[1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:08.880]  they're going to say we've got to count all the ballots they're going to have
[1:48:08.880 --> 1:48:12.080]  some states that go along with that to hold this up weeks or months
[1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:14.720]  i'm really concerned as you said a few months ago
[1:48:14.720 --> 1:48:18.320]  that trump still doesn't have a big lawyer ground game the democrat one i'm
[1:48:18.320 --> 1:48:20.800]  seeing is about 10 times bigger correct me if i'm wrong
[1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:25.680]  to try to just tie all this up because they know they've lost
[1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:29.120]  but make it look like it's contested and then polosi says he's going to try to
[1:48:29.120 --> 1:48:31.920]  pull a 20th amendment event and and make sure trump doesn't get
[1:48:31.920 --> 1:48:35.920]  inaugurated on the 20th of january 2021
[1:48:35.920 --> 1:48:40.320]  well there was very encouraging sign yesterday alex because early voting
[1:48:40.320 --> 1:48:44.080]  began in florida and republicans out
[1:48:44.080 --> 1:48:49.200]  produced democrats in the very first day that's a very very
[1:48:49.200 --> 1:48:53.280]  good sign because i had some concerns when the president
[1:48:53.280 --> 1:48:58.720]  correctly criticized the safety uh and the potential for fraud in mail in
[1:48:58.720 --> 1:49:02.960]  voting some older republicans got confused
[1:49:02.960 --> 1:49:06.000]  and were worried that their absentee ballots
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:10.400]  which they have by tradition file might not get counted
[1:49:10.400 --> 1:49:13.600]  and therefore they needed to show up in person
[1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:21.440]  that seems to be happening a very very good sign as far as i'm concerned
[1:49:21.440 --> 1:49:25.120]  the other factor here what about the one where there's a
[1:49:25.120 --> 1:49:29.920]  76 percent of google searches are how to search republican versus
[1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:33.440]  24 how to search democrat that scares the hell out of them too that
[1:49:33.440 --> 1:49:38.800]  over two to one people are searching how to change party affiliations
[1:49:38.800 --> 1:49:44.560]  well in fact in pennsylvania for example 200 000 new republicans
[1:49:44.560 --> 1:49:48.000]  have registered since the last presidential election
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:51.920]  easily outpacing the democrats so now there is some
[1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:57.200]  anecdotal good news i'm feeling much better uh but
[1:49:57.200 --> 1:50:00.880]  again a day is a lifetime in american politics
[1:50:00.880 --> 1:50:04.160]  the president has the momentum i think he will
[1:50:04.160 --> 1:50:08.160]  keep the momentum the question is not can he beat joe biden
[1:50:08.160 --> 1:50:11.760]  the question is can he beat the fake news media
[1:50:11.760 --> 1:50:15.200]  that is deeply committed to hiding the truth
[1:50:15.200 --> 1:50:18.480]  from the american people i totally agree in closing
[1:50:18.480 --> 1:50:21.840]  stonefamilysupportfund.com folks he's a great patriot he thanks you for
[1:50:21.840 --> 1:50:24.480]  supporting him check that out keep in the fight it's it's

[1:50:31.280 --> 1:50:34.640]  do they have an october surprise on trump and we we know it's gonna be fake but
[1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:38.800]  what is their october surprise on trump looks like there is nothing
[1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:42.880]  well if there was anything i think we'd know it by far they've tried everything
[1:50:42.880 --> 1:50:48.480]  there was the russian collusion hoax there was the ukrainian hoax which now
[1:50:48.480 --> 1:50:53.840]  these emails proved definitively uh were a hoax
[1:50:53.840 --> 1:50:58.720]  and then they tried to benefit from the fallout of covet 19
[1:50:58.720 --> 1:51:02.880]  no with don trump what you see is what you get
[1:51:02.880 --> 1:51:06.880]  that's why the voters love him he's genuine he's real
[1:51:06.880 --> 1:51:11.920]  he's authentic and i saw him last night he was on fire
[1:51:11.920 --> 1:51:15.840]  absolutely roger i'm trying to get you here in austin for the election in
[1:51:15.840 --> 1:51:19.120]  12 days but regardless you're gonna be with us on election night just like four

[1:51:47.920 --> 1:51:51.680]  is a huge populace realignment and so they've openly said
[1:51:51.680 --> 1:51:55.760]  we need to go to pure authoritarianism not just censorship but physically
[1:51:55.760 --> 1:51:59.440]  attacking and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our
[1:51:59.440 --> 1:52:02.480]  agenda and they're on records saying that once they
[1:52:02.480 --> 1:52:05.040]  remove trump they are going to persecute
[1:52:05.040 --> 1:52:09.440]  trumps base and going to try to prosecute us and put us all in prison
[1:52:09.440 --> 1:52:13.920]  this is what all the old clinton easters are saying it's what the obama bots are
[1:52:13.920 --> 1:52:16.560]  saying it's what keith oberman saying it's what the
[1:52:16.560 --> 1:52:23.040]  nancy losie saying this is their stated criminal authoritarian intent
[1:52:23.040 --> 1:52:26.640]  and they intend to keep the lockdowns going forever and force denoculations
[1:52:26.640 --> 1:52:30.160]  trump is trying to end the lockdowns and to say vaccines will be

[1:54:32.640 --> 1:54:36.880]  coming up the start of the next segment but i wanted to hit this report
[1:54:36.880 --> 1:54:40.880]  because there's so many these clips i haven't got to of juliani
[1:54:40.880 --> 1:54:45.200]  has given hunter biden's hard drive to delaware state police and he gets into
[1:54:45.200 --> 1:54:49.360]  some of the things that are on it hunter biden photograph naked with a 14-year-old
[1:54:49.360 --> 1:54:52.000]  girl here it is
[1:54:52.640 --> 1:54:58.000]  well this is really a very very sensitive one there's a text message to his
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:01.840]  father in which he says the following and he's
[1:55:01.840 --> 1:55:06.880]  discussing um he's discussing his uh sister-in-law
[1:55:06.880 --> 1:55:12.480]  who for quite some time was his lover and he says uh she she told my therapist
[1:55:12.480 --> 1:55:18.560]  that i was sexually inappropriate this would be with a unnamed 14-year-old
[1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:22.000]  girl when she says that i faced time naked
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:27.120]  with the unnamed 14-year-old girl and the reason i can't have her out to
[1:55:27.120 --> 1:55:31.040]  see me is because i'll walk around naked smoking crack
[1:55:31.040 --> 1:55:36.480]  talking tom girls on phase nine when she was pressed she said that the unnamed
[1:55:36.480 --> 1:55:41.280]  14-year-old girl never said anything like that but the bottom line is that i
[1:55:41.280 --> 1:55:48.000]  created and caused a very unsafe environment for the kids
[1:55:48.080 --> 1:55:55.120]  uh this is supported by numerous pictures of underage
[1:55:55.120 --> 1:56:00.080]  girls so mr. mayor i uh that is look that's dynamite
[1:56:00.080 --> 1:56:03.680]  stuff uh and i've seen it i turned it over to the
[1:56:03.680 --> 1:56:07.600]  you turned it over to the Delaware state police correct
[1:56:07.600 --> 1:56:11.040]  yes yesterday bernie karak and i turned it over to the Delaware state because
[1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:14.640]  we're very uncomfortable with this so we're very uncomfortable with the fact
[1:56:14.640 --> 1:56:19.520]  that these underage girls were not protected so here's the deal hunter biden
[1:56:19.520 --> 1:56:22.560]  let's face it he's never going to be elected to anything
[1:56:22.560 --> 1:56:26.160]  and he'll probably wind up in jail someday for something who knows
[1:56:26.160 --> 1:56:30.400]  but i'm more concerned about the vice president because he's the one who's
[1:56:30.400 --> 1:56:33.440]  running right i see that but you know what i don't see mr
[1:56:33.440 --> 1:56:36.960]  sent to the vice president here's the deal and look
[1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:40.880]  i want to be clear here i'm like him yeah but you know what is not fair to him
[1:56:40.880 --> 1:56:44.400]  what what what did he do about it exactly about it
[1:56:44.400 --> 1:56:48.400]  well three years mr. mayor the only thing is
[1:56:48.400 --> 1:56:51.760]  in that hold on a second in the text messaging you just showed me and we
[1:56:51.760 --> 1:56:55.680]  went through we've got junior who is joe biden
[1:56:55.680 --> 1:57:00.240]  talking to hunter biden we have no acknowledgement in what we just saw
[1:57:00.240 --> 1:57:03.760]  from the vice president we don't know what he knows or whatever and this is
[1:57:03.760 --> 1:57:07.760]  all family drama and by the way it's so late it's big time it's
[1:57:07.760 --> 1:57:12.160]  they could be in trouble i and i'm glad you got it out there but i want to know
[1:57:12.160 --> 1:57:16.480]  is there anything concrete tying joe biden to
[1:57:16.480 --> 1:57:21.920]  barisma money money from china uh you know it does not look good at all to me
[1:57:21.920 --> 1:57:25.280]  those emails and what they were up to anything in that regard and if you
[1:57:25.280 --> 1:57:27.360]  haven't found it yet you're kind of saying
[1:57:27.360 --> 1:57:31.360]  it might still be there because how much of this hard drive already
[1:57:31.360 --> 1:57:37.680]  you found it there's a memo in here that says the 10 percent
[1:57:37.680 --> 1:57:41.600]  of the money that was being uh whacked up
[1:57:41.600 --> 1:57:46.320]  that was ten million dollars a year and then 50 percent of the profits with
[1:57:46.320 --> 1:57:49.680]  three chinese communists one of whom was a chinese
[1:57:49.680 --> 1:57:53.120]  intelligence operatives that 10 percent of that was going to
[1:57:53.120 --> 1:57:57.520]  h for the big guy so we've identified the big guy
[1:57:57.520 --> 1:58:04.400]  several ways one we are all tired but mostly i'm tired of the needless
[1:58:04.400 --> 1:58:08.400]  sickness and the needless death and the needless terror because this mentally
[1:58:08.400 --> 1:58:12.800]  incompetent inhuman dumb bastard has lied about this
[1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:16.320]  disease in a thousand different ways a different way for each different
[1:58:16.320 --> 1:58:20.240]  political need he has sensed and i'm tired of the thought
[1:58:20.240 --> 1:58:23.120]  that we are now going to repeat the months of march and april in this
[1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:26.000]  country a country that should have learned something
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:30.080]  but which in large part hasn't been authorized to wallow and die in its own
[1:58:30.080 --> 1:58:35.760]  stupidity because of one man one dumb bastard one selfish son of a
[1:58:35.760 --> 1:58:39.200]  bitch one real life major french attacking the
[1:58:39.200 --> 1:58:42.800]  only hope we have the science boy they're scared aren't they
[1:58:42.800 --> 1:58:46.480]  isn't that little nancy boy scared
[1:58:47.120 --> 1:58:52.800]  history is now history is taking place in front of us we are at the crossroads
[1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:57.120]  we are now only two weeks out for the most historic and important election in
[1:58:57.120 --> 1:59:00.240]  world history i've been saying that for over a year but now people really
[1:59:00.240 --> 1:59:03.680]  understand i wasn't exaggerating this is so critical the new world order wants
[1:59:03.680 --> 1:59:07.200]  to repudiate the nation state that will repudiate the idea of america they
[1:59:07.200 --> 1:59:10.480]  want to repudiate the idea of the renaissance and the enlightenment
[1:59:10.480 --> 1:59:15.200]  and bring in their technocracy so they are throwing everything
[1:59:15.200 --> 1:59:18.400]  they've got it's not just the america people but the people of the world
[1:59:18.400 --> 1:59:21.360]  that's why your word of mouth is beyond king
[1:59:21.360 --> 1:59:25.840]  it is paramount when you spread the articles when you spread the videos
[1:59:25.840 --> 1:59:28.800]  when you shoot your own video or write your own article or knock on your
[1:59:28.800 --> 1:59:31.520]  neighbor's door and talk to them or call your friends and family and tell them
[1:59:31.520 --> 1:59:34.960]  to vote for trump when you speak out against the system when you do things
[1:59:34.960 --> 1:59:38.480]  that seem little together it adds up into giant things
[1:59:38.480 --> 1:59:42.800]  many hands make life work history's happening now take action now while you
[1:59:42.800 --> 1:59:47.040]  still can please for all of our futures
[1:59:53.760 --> 1:59:59.440]  one last breath the forewind blows better raise your ears
[1:59:59.440 --> 2:00:04.240]  a big brother mainstream media government cover-ups

[2:00:07.600 --> 2:00:10.880]  live from the info wars dot com studios

[2:00:36.800 --> 2:00:41.920]  they must have looked this on many years ago

[2:01:29.200 --> 2:01:36.160]  vaccine trials killing people so choose your fate and die
[2:01:36.160 --> 2:01:38.800]  yeah
[2:01:40.160 --> 2:01:43.120]  all right let's get real here
[2:01:43.680 --> 2:01:46.800]  let's start getting into it
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:56.640]  the globalist plan is just to press human development and stop us going to
[2:01:56.640 --> 2:01:59.200]  the next level
[2:02:00.160 --> 2:02:05.200]  and if you go back to the history books whether it was the ancient druids or the
[2:02:05.200 --> 2:02:09.920]  ancient mesoamericans or the ancient egyptians
[2:02:10.880 --> 2:02:16.800]  they would routinely order the first born sons and sometimes the first born
[2:02:16.800 --> 2:02:23.360]  daughters to be killed by the sword to be have their hearts cut out to be
[2:02:23.360 --> 2:02:27.200]  bound and thrown into deep wells
[2:02:27.600 --> 2:02:30.960]  i've been to mexico to one particular temple where they went down and
[2:02:30.960 --> 2:02:34.640]  excavated in this cenote and there's just hundreds of thousands of
[2:02:34.640 --> 2:02:39.440]  skeletons it just makes up the gravel and it's it's mainly
[2:02:39.440 --> 2:02:43.280]  little girls little girls got thrown into that
[2:02:43.280 --> 2:02:48.000]  and little boys got their hearts cut up where does this come from and if you
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:51.440]  understand this you understand all of it and why
[2:02:51.440 --> 2:02:56.560]  every culture does this and why it keeps coming back there's
[2:02:56.560 --> 2:03:00.000]  something going on something wants to do this to
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:04.560]  our best and brightest and nothing against might was born second third
[2:03:04.560 --> 2:03:07.840]  or fourth it's just statistically
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:13.040]  higher IQs more success rates because it's now known in epigenetics that the
[2:03:13.040 --> 2:03:16.400]  first born gets more of the genetic
[2:03:16.400 --> 2:03:22.160]  transference into them they also get more of the mother's
[2:03:22.160 --> 2:03:27.520]  physical toxins that she's built up he's also pushed into the child
[2:03:27.520 --> 2:03:30.720]  but then there's also nurture not just nature
[2:03:30.720 --> 2:03:33.920]  once they're around adults they're the first child
[2:03:33.920 --> 2:03:37.440]  they watch the adults at first that don't have children interact with
[2:03:37.440 --> 2:03:41.200]  and and see themselves more like adults and then interact with children
[2:03:41.200 --> 2:03:45.360]  see themselves more as parents so there's also that effect that takes place
[2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:48.880]  how they just pulled it up yeah the cenotes full of all the little girls
[2:03:48.880 --> 2:03:52.560]  they sacrifice throwing them into the water
[2:03:54.560 --> 2:03:57.680]  and it's the same crap every group does it so
[2:03:57.680 --> 2:04:01.440]  where does this come from it well every culture said
[2:04:01.440 --> 2:04:06.160]  creatures from the stars gods from the stars
[2:04:06.160 --> 2:04:09.120]  told them to do this
[2:04:09.120 --> 2:04:18.560]  you can't make that up either what does it mean you figure it out yourself folks
[2:04:18.560 --> 2:04:22.560]  but the so-called elites on this planet are not elites they've decided to serve
[2:04:22.560 --> 2:04:26.800]  an evil force in the universe we serve a good force
[2:04:26.800 --> 2:04:30.480]  and we have to choose that good force
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:35.440]  now let's shift gears of the temporal and what's currently happening i'll give
[2:04:35.440 --> 2:04:39.200]  the number don't take calls throughout this hour
[2:04:40.880 --> 2:04:46.000]  80 million ballots supposedly because of coven 19
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:49.920]  but the shutdown rallies of trump paralyzed republicans
[2:04:49.920 --> 2:04:53.840]  when democrats and black lives matter march it's good for coven
[2:04:53.840 --> 2:04:57.760]  that's a headline study show black lives matter my rallies help coven
[2:04:57.760 --> 2:05:00.640]  what the hell does that mean
[2:05:00.640 --> 2:05:06.480]  oh trump's causing the upsurge in coven not deaths
[2:05:06.560 --> 2:05:10.720]  the number of people that supposedly have it and then most the testers like
[2:05:10.720 --> 2:05:16.880]  five tests out now and almost all of them are false positives when you get it
[2:05:18.320 --> 2:05:21.600]  and then oh we got one person in the warehouse one person at the dental
[2:05:21.600 --> 2:05:25.760]  office one person at the grocery store one person at the school one person at
[2:05:25.760 --> 2:05:29.920]  the auto repair shop one person at the farm one person at the golf course
[2:05:29.920 --> 2:05:34.000]  one person at the church has covered
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  joe rogan's podcast totally shut down i know the guest he had
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:41.760]  not just the ones you've heard kanya west you name it i talked to joe last
[2:05:41.760 --> 2:05:46.400]  night i'm going to say the names shut down
[2:05:46.400 --> 2:05:51.280]  because the producer the company spotify makes them take
[2:05:51.280 --> 2:05:55.520]  covid test every time they go to work well you saw the meat packing class
[2:05:55.520 --> 2:05:59.120]  they make 3 000 employees get a meat packing test and 500
[2:05:59.120 --> 2:06:03.520]  have coven none of them are sick because it's a false positive
[2:06:03.520 --> 2:06:08.720]  it's a virus so deadly that you're not even sick when you've got it
[2:06:08.720 --> 2:06:13.440]  because you've ever had a bacterial infection or a viral infection or
[2:06:13.440 --> 2:06:18.080]  a cold the last couple years or even longer the average is 10 years then it's
[2:06:18.080 --> 2:06:21.920]  false positive and you sit there and you tell people that
[2:06:21.920 --> 2:06:24.880]  they still listen to
[2:06:24.880 --> 2:06:30.800]  nobody's had covid in my company because nobody's been tested nobody's been
[2:06:30.800 --> 2:06:35.840]  sick it didn't happen but we're not run by these lawyers
[2:06:36.480 --> 2:06:43.760]  so here's the big story yahu finance catches man using pin on melden ballot
[2:06:43.760 --> 2:06:47.840]  election meddling well the headline should be it's not a bad
[2:06:47.840 --> 2:06:51.200]  headline we put up but it's it's yahu finance catches election
[2:06:51.200 --> 2:06:55.360]  official altering ballot with pin let's change that headline
[2:06:55.360 --> 2:07:02.400]  yahu finance catches election official altering ballot with pin
[2:07:02.560 --> 2:07:08.800]  video just went up the last hour at bandod video and this is an alive feed
[2:07:08.800 --> 2:07:12.400]  of yahu they wouldn't let us in there to show this stuff this is in german town
[2:07:12.400 --> 2:07:15.680]  maryland so for radio listeners i'll narrate it for
[2:07:15.680 --> 2:07:19.040]  TV viewers here it is then we'll slow down the worst part
[2:07:19.040 --> 2:07:22.000]  where the guy because i'm sitting there dealing with ballots i've i've got an
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:25.520]  election uh volunteering at least four times you're there helping get them
[2:07:25.520 --> 2:07:28.480]  put them in the scanner you're just making sure they're stacked up in the
[2:07:28.480 --> 2:07:31.120]  right order you're not but nobody like looks over their
[2:07:31.120 --> 2:07:37.040]  shoulder has a pin and then starts scribbling something like
[2:07:37.920 --> 2:07:42.320]  i mean it's on video so here it is
[2:07:42.320 --> 2:07:47.760]  man looks around
[2:07:50.480 --> 2:07:55.760]  it's the ballot grabs a pin
[2:07:56.320 --> 2:08:00.800]  and then starts on the scantron on the ballot filling something out
[2:08:00.800 --> 2:08:07.200]  is this fraud i mean what is this and again we had the full
[2:08:07.200 --> 2:08:11.760]  video from yahu where he's doing other ballots he's looking at him folding
[2:08:11.760 --> 2:08:14.080]  them to check on him laying them back down this one
[2:08:14.080 --> 2:08:18.000]  he lays out he looks around because there's like an hour of this video
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:21.520]  of him doing ballots then some he ignores others he done others he just
[2:08:21.520 --> 2:08:28.080]  looks behind him and then and then the camera operator i guess figures out
[2:08:28.080 --> 2:08:32.480]  they've caught something they're not supposed to they start painting away
[2:08:32.480 --> 2:08:39.200]  once he starts putting a pin he picks a pin up and starts
[2:08:39.200 --> 2:08:42.880]  writing on the ballot and we looked up the maryland regulations they don't do
[2:08:42.880 --> 2:08:47.040]  that the ballots thrown out they stamp it thrown a trash can
[2:08:47.040 --> 2:08:50.960]  now maybe he just doesn't know what he's doing but imagine 80 million of these
[2:08:50.960 --> 2:08:54.000]  are floating around and you've got all these good little
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:58.160]  liberal minions all these good democrats volunteering and they're all
[2:08:58.160 --> 2:09:03.600]  in there doing god knows what right now yahu
[2:09:03.600 --> 2:09:08.560]  finance catches man using pin on meldon ballot is this election meddling
[2:09:08.560 --> 2:09:11.680]  that's a strong headline but the real headline
[2:09:11.680 --> 2:09:16.560]  is yahu finance catches election official
[2:09:16.560 --> 2:09:20.400]  altering ballot with pin
[2:09:20.720 --> 2:09:26.480]  you're not supposed to do that now i'm sure he's a good person it's all just
[2:09:26.480 --> 2:09:29.920]  an accident but we need to know this is going on
[2:09:29.920 --> 2:09:33.120]  that's why they're all meld in it's why most people have already voted
[2:09:33.120 --> 2:09:36.160]  it's they've got months to jack with your ballots and they're catching them being
[2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:39.760]  thrown away and destroyed it's always trump ballots being thrown away
[2:09:39.760 --> 2:09:43.040]  of course it is because they know there's a giant
[2:09:43.040 --> 2:09:48.560]  landslide against them COVID rollout has been extremely well planned
[2:09:48.560 --> 2:09:51.920]  very well thought out and has been incrementally orchestrated
[2:09:51.920 --> 2:09:55.680]  first it's 15 days to keep the hospitals empty that's all i then it's
[2:09:55.680 --> 2:09:59.600]  two months and it's six months then it's a year now bill gates has 10 years
[2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:03.200]  and people are not saying i like my mask i like my face diaper
[2:10:03.200 --> 2:10:08.400]  i like my binky and so getting into the fear getting into the hysteria getting
[2:10:08.400 --> 2:10:13.520]  into all the exaggerated death numbers this is our new
[2:10:13.520 --> 2:10:17.840]  neurotic control freak society overseen by robots
[2:10:17.840 --> 2:10:21.920]  overseen by ai and all of it is designed
[2:10:21.920 --> 2:10:26.400]  to make humans non-essential that's why out of the gates they tell us
[2:10:26.400 --> 2:10:30.400]  you are non-essential you are non-essential
[2:10:30.400 --> 2:10:34.240]  your company your restaurant your job
[2:10:34.240 --> 2:10:38.800]  your profession is not essential this is so incredibly authoritarian
[2:10:38.800 --> 2:10:41.680]  premeditated and bill gates sits on top of it
[2:10:41.680 --> 2:10:48.560]  come on folks let's reject this the answer to 1984
[2:10:48.560 --> 2:10:52.880]  is 1776
[2:10:52.880 --> 2:10:56.880]  so

[2:13:09.120 --> 2:13:13.200]  or state police and they're not denying it they're just hoping
[2:13:13.200 --> 2:13:20.320]  they can censor it and cover it up 877-789-2539 but let's look at keith
[2:13:20.320 --> 2:13:26.880]  oberman baseball commentator brought over to msnbc
[2:13:26.880 --> 2:13:31.040]  russian scum kill the american people anyway what is for trump is a russian

[2:13:40.160 --> 2:13:43.600]  it's the flu it's something else they're massively exaggerating and
[2:13:43.600 --> 2:13:46.640]  he doesn't tell you take vitamin c or vitamin d3 or zinc
[2:13:46.640 --> 2:13:50.720]  he doesn't tell you hey no no he just says every death is trumps fault
[2:13:50.720 --> 2:13:56.400]  how transparent it's not the chinese virus it's the american virus here is
[2:13:56.400 --> 2:14:02.320]  keith oberman we are all tired but mostly i'm tired of the needless

[2:16:35.760 --> 2:16:40.000]  we are all tired but mostly i'm tired of the needless
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:44.000]  sickness and the needless death and the needless terror because this mentally
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:49.440]  incompetent inhuman dumb bastard has lied about this disease in a thousand
[2:16:49.440 --> 2:16:53.280]  different ways a different way for each different political need he has
[2:16:53.280 --> 2:16:58.720]  sensed and i'm tired of the thought and pause again i'm sorry i started over
[2:16:58.720 --> 2:17:01.360]  i'm not going to do it again but literally everything they did was fake
[2:17:01.360 --> 2:17:05.520]  numbers fake test fake every political need they need this is pure projection
[2:17:05.520 --> 2:17:08.560]  everything he says about trump is about himself so keep over and instead of wanting
[2:17:08.560 --> 2:17:12.640]  to kill the president he should just get a nice rope get in there he can even
[2:17:12.640 --> 2:17:16.080]  write a note said a kkk did it like jesse small it and just put it around his
[2:17:16.080 --> 2:17:20.800]  neck and just jump off just just jump off keith just go oh and then you know
[2:17:20.800 --> 2:17:24.320]  said i want to kill america and projecting your hatred that you have

[2:17:44.480 --> 2:17:50.000]  we are all tired but mostly i'm tired of the needless sickness and the needless
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:53.600]  death and the needless terror because this mentally incompetent
[2:17:53.600 --> 2:17:59.040]  inhuman dumb bastard has lied about this disease in a thousand different ways a
[2:17:59.040 --> 2:18:03.440]  different way for each different political need he has sensed and i'm
[2:18:03.440 --> 2:18:06.800]  tired of the thought that we are now going to repeat the months of march and
[2:18:06.800 --> 2:18:10.320]  april in this country oh that should have learned something
[2:18:10.320 --> 2:18:14.400]  but which in large part hasn't been authorized to wallow and die in its own
[2:18:14.400 --> 2:18:20.160]  stupidity because of one man one dumb bastard one selfish son of a
[2:18:20.160 --> 2:18:23.520]  bitch one real life major and he's over attacking the
[2:18:23.520 --> 2:18:27.680]  only hope we have the science and insist the science wrong

[2:18:31.120 --> 2:18:34.960]  you can do whatever you want then the disease affects almost nobody
[2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:38.000]  donald trump should be on trial for 220
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:43.200]  thousand murders death penalty for each count
[2:18:43.200 --> 2:18:49.040]  wow mic drop so 94 percent of those died of something else

[2:19:05.920 --> 2:19:11.600]  teleprompter reader and nobody buys his bs but that's why
[2:19:11.600 --> 2:19:15.600]  he sat there with his best straight face for money
[2:19:15.600 --> 2:19:21.360]  and just said what he said the goodness is humanity is awake to his scams
[2:19:21.360 --> 2:19:25.200]  they're awake to the things he's doing president trump

[2:21:37.440 --> 2:21:40.880]  year obviously we're critical to fight and you've helped win the war against the
[2:21:40.880 --> 2:21:45.840]  global so far if you pay close attention to what big
[2:21:45.840 --> 2:21:48.800]  tech is actually saying and more importantly what they're actually
[2:21:48.800 --> 2:21:54.000]  doing when they shut down the hunter biden laptop story
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:57.040]  that was a test to see if they could work in concert
[2:21:57.040 --> 2:22:01.840]  to totally suppress information because they've also been on record saying
[2:22:01.840 --> 2:22:04.880]  coming up on election day and thereafter they're not going to let
[2:22:04.880 --> 2:22:08.800]  anyone but quote authoritative sources that means cnn new york times what a
[2:22:08.800 --> 2:22:12.560]  joke come out and say who the real winner is
[2:22:12.560 --> 2:22:15.840]  that way they can contest the election even though trumps declare winner hold
[2:22:15.840 --> 2:22:19.360]  everything up with the ballots then cause a constitutional crisis
[2:22:19.360 --> 2:22:23.760]  call for secession and have the un come in and declare the election for biden
[2:22:23.760 --> 2:22:27.200]  this is what john pedestrian others are on record saying and so when you see
[2:22:27.200 --> 2:22:30.800]  them in concert censoring something like the hunter biden laptop story
[2:22:30.800 --> 2:22:35.120]  that is a drill that is a test to get all their systems ready but also to
[2:22:35.120 --> 2:22:38.400]  condition the public that big tech works in unison to
[2:22:38.400 --> 2:22:43.760]  suppress speech and information this is election meddling 101 this is illegal
[2:22:43.760 --> 2:22:48.320]  2020 election center dot com just type it in one time you've got to

[2:23:16.880 --> 2:23:20.480]  overrode them four years ago trump has finally figured this out since he's
[2:23:20.480 --> 2:23:23.840]  going to take action once reelected against big tech i mean he's
[2:23:23.840 --> 2:23:26.640]  modern situation well we know the president's overwhelmed right now so
[2:23:26.640 --> 2:23:30.240]  we're going to sit here and cry because he has taken action we the people

[2:23:57.680 --> 2:24:01.600]  welcome back i'm your host alex jones moving quick here so we get to everybody
[2:24:01.600 --> 2:24:05.760]  julia in origan you're on the air thanks for calling
[2:24:05.760 --> 2:24:09.680]  hi how are you doing i have two quick um points that i'd like to make
[2:24:09.680 --> 2:24:13.920]  first of all bill bar announcing that he was waiting until after the election
[2:24:13.920 --> 2:24:17.600]  so it didn't appear political actually made it political
[2:24:17.600 --> 2:24:23.040]  and he tipped his hand um showing that he's hoping that a biden win
[2:24:23.040 --> 2:24:28.320]  would mean he doesn't have to prosecute his fellow swamp creatures
[2:24:28.320 --> 2:24:30.960]  i mean i agree with that statement that means they've got black metal material on
[2:24:30.960 --> 2:24:35.120]  him yeah there's no question and and all of the
[2:24:35.120 --> 2:24:39.920]  biden endorsements lately i mean you saw a big flood of these people that were
[2:24:39.920 --> 2:24:43.360]  endorsing biden basically announces to the world
[2:24:43.360 --> 2:24:48.080]  i'm a pedophile and they have dirt on me and so i'm going to endorse
[2:24:48.080 --> 2:24:53.360]  um joe biden so that i don't get prosecuted i mean do these have these
[2:24:53.360 --> 2:24:57.120]  people never played poker well that's what democrats do they're on the news
[2:24:57.120 --> 2:25:01.280]  saying we're going to arrest everyone that doesn't support by i mean it's like a
[2:25:01.280 --> 2:25:06.720]  total declaration of hitlerian stylistic mal war i mean it's
[2:25:06.720 --> 2:25:12.000]  it's like textbook tyranny it's like it's it's crazy
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:15.520]  it's it's really it's really sad though when you look at joe biden he's nothing
[2:25:15.520 --> 2:25:19.920]  but a pawn i believe that he was selected because they know he's a
[2:25:19.920 --> 2:25:23.840]  disaster expecting that when and and they're so
[2:25:23.840 --> 2:25:27.440]  arrogant that they think that he would actually win so that when he's selected
[2:25:27.440 --> 2:25:32.000]  he's immediately then impeached and removed harris is installed who they
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:36.960]  wanted all along oh exactly they're creating a constitutional crisis
[2:25:36.960 --> 2:25:40.800]  to to to kill the dollar the real goal is to kill the dollar
[2:25:40.800 --> 2:25:44.720]  make us lose our superpower status so china becomes it that that's a hundred
[2:25:44.720 --> 2:25:47.840]  percent what's happening one of the one of the things
[2:25:47.840 --> 2:25:50.800]  that i find most interesting historically speaking
[2:25:50.800 --> 2:25:55.360]  i see donald trump is a nebuchadnezzar type of individual
[2:25:55.360 --> 2:25:59.280]  and when nebuchadnezzar first took power of the ancient babelonian empire there
[2:25:59.280 --> 2:26:03.280]  was a huge coup that tried to remove him
[2:26:03.280 --> 2:26:07.920]  and it was nearly successful it was so bad his three teachers
[2:26:07.920 --> 2:26:13.120]  that um he had to defend his own life in his own palace with his own sword
[2:26:13.120 --> 2:26:17.360]  but it was not successful and the whole point
[2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:22.080]  of nebuchadnezzar's reign in babelon was to i kid you not
[2:26:22.080 --> 2:26:27.120]  make babelon great again i remember that and he had certain advisors that he
[2:26:27.120 --> 2:26:29.440]  kept me from happening god bless shepherds your call
[2:26:29.440 --> 2:26:32.960]  i've noticed metaphysically mathematically the way the universe works
[2:26:32.960 --> 2:26:36.960]  is that's really what metaphysics is is the unseen
[2:26:36.960 --> 2:26:40.800]  system of mathematics that good and evil are equal to a certain point with
[2:26:40.800 --> 2:26:44.720]  free will but god's always greater and that everything we do it's like you
[2:26:44.720 --> 2:26:49.520]  said nebuchadnezzar that last moment with all the battles outside the palace
[2:26:49.520 --> 2:26:53.600]  it came down to him winning it's like the vice president breaking a tie on the
[2:26:53.600 --> 2:26:56.560]  senate it's it's always right down the line
[2:26:56.560 --> 2:27:00.480]  it's like rush limbaugh is dying right now right as we come down to the line
[2:27:00.480 --> 2:27:02.800]  you know all this is happening i mean this is
[2:27:02.800 --> 2:27:06.400]  this is like like everybody's spending themselves
[2:27:06.400 --> 2:27:10.160]  right up to this point this is so epic right now all right let's take another
[2:27:10.160 --> 2:27:14.080]  call interesting uh let's talk to daniel in oklahoma

[2:29:52.800 --> 2:29:56.400]  warrior in a battle right now you are a literal
[2:29:56.400 --> 2:30:00.800]  soldier you do not have congress funding you to fight this battle
[2:30:00.800 --> 2:30:05.600]  and so people need to really get in on your store they need to order supplements
[2:30:05.600 --> 2:30:08.400]  they're supporting you they're supporting their nation they're supporting
[2:30:08.400 --> 2:30:11.920]  their own health um and they really need to get

[2:30:15.760 --> 2:30:18.560]  we're all in this together let me ask you this question
[2:30:18.560 --> 2:30:22.320]  what do you think's coming next i mean i don't see how they beat trump he's got a
[2:30:22.320 --> 2:30:26.960]  massive landslide but they're intending to say he loses i this i mean i feel like
[2:30:26.960 --> 2:30:30.880]  you've ever been in a car wreck and a guy runs a red light and you see the car
[2:30:30.880 --> 2:30:34.240]  and you can't believe they ran the red light this happened to me a month ago
[2:30:34.240 --> 2:30:38.720]  and then they still hit you so i mean it's like that slow motion of like this
[2:30:38.720 --> 2:30:41.040]  is happening i mean how bad is it going to be because
[2:30:41.040 --> 2:30:44.320]  you know you're about to get hit you're about to get t-boned but you don't
[2:30:44.320 --> 2:30:46.800]  know how bad it's going to be do you have that same feeling
[2:30:46.800 --> 2:30:49.680]  and we don't know what direction it's coming is it coming from the driver's
[2:30:49.680 --> 2:30:53.120]  side the rear that the passengers that we don't know
[2:30:53.120 --> 2:30:56.960]  so uh let me ask you this alex what's your thoughts on
[2:30:56.960 --> 2:31:00.400]  on rudi julianity and the one to release all this stuff because
[2:31:00.400 --> 2:31:05.920]  after 9 11 you know i i you know where's juliana well there's no there's no doubt
[2:31:05.920 --> 2:31:09.600]  juliani went along with the cover-up of 9 11 i don't think he was involved in it
[2:31:09.600 --> 2:31:12.960]  and something maybe he was a famous anti-navigation man
[2:31:12.960 --> 2:31:16.480]  no i mean i i i agree i mean i've had to see patrinic on everybody that
[2:31:16.480 --> 2:31:20.000]  9 11 radical his mom's real they were involved but criminal groups
[2:31:20.000 --> 2:31:23.600]  were involved using it as a cover for something larger to get rid of the cia
[2:31:23.600 --> 2:31:27.680]  headquarters and all the clinton files in building 7 and
[2:31:27.680 --> 2:31:30.480]  juliani his mayor is not a stupid guy he's very smart
[2:31:30.480 --> 2:31:33.840]  he definitely went along with it so yeah that that that's something i thought
[2:31:33.840 --> 2:31:37.760]  about what do you think well i i think that there's no
[2:31:37.760 --> 2:31:41.840]  way he could be having sex with little kids if he's releasing this stuff
[2:31:41.840 --> 2:31:45.600]  you know because it's going to come back to bite him if he if he's in on it

[2:32:19.600 --> 2:32:23.440]  format that you can look it up on a map and you can see somebody's address and
[2:32:23.440 --> 2:32:26.880]  their name and how much they've donated and with everything going on with antifa
[2:32:26.880 --> 2:32:29.600]  this is a straight up hit list i heard about this a few months ago that

[2:33:16.960 --> 2:33:19.920]  just because these people need to be dealt with but we need to be like gondy
[2:33:19.920 --> 2:33:23.120]  or martin Luther king whose example was jesus christ
[2:33:23.120 --> 2:33:26.800]  uh that there's times to hold them and times to fold them times to walk away
[2:33:26.800 --> 2:33:30.320]  times to run right now i'm going to take those punches
[2:33:30.320 --> 2:33:34.000]  like the blacklist during the god his teeth knocked out in san francisco for
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:37.360]  a greater cause it's not because i'm a whip because i'm not going to get the

[2:36:52.640 --> 2:36:57.200]  the precedent for coordinated big tech censorship now the world
[2:36:57.200 --> 2:37:00.560]  finally understands it but we don't have two and a half years

[2:37:15.120 --> 2:37:19.120]  power grab it is a revolution against the industrial revolution
[2:37:19.120 --> 2:37:22.960]  they call it the post-industrial world and it's the excuse for them to take
[2:37:22.960 --> 2:37:27.280]  control every fast of our lives and implement absolute authoritarianism
[2:37:27.280 --> 2:37:30.800]  so again to everybody out there if you love your children but my daughter that

[2:39:38.880 --> 2:39:42.240]  teo in new jersey thanks for holding go ahead
[2:39:42.240 --> 2:39:45.760]  hey alex um everything you were saying about the nursing homes is true my
[2:39:45.760 --> 2:39:49.120]  father works in a nursing home in new jersey and he told me about the incentives
[2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:51.760]  that everybody got everybody got hush money they got their increased wages
[2:39:51.760 --> 2:39:54.240]  they're definitely calling people in the nursing homes
[2:39:54.240 --> 2:39:57.040]  well spend some time on that i mean tell us because we know
[2:39:57.040 --> 2:40:00.480]  only place they can kill you is we don't get sunlight don't get vitamin d in
[2:40:00.480 --> 2:40:03.600]  things and then they sent people with covid there to get those death
[2:40:03.600 --> 2:40:06.720]  numbers what murderers but what was your dad saying
[2:40:06.720 --> 2:40:10.960]  uh he's been working in the physical therapy uh realm at at nursing homes for
[2:40:10.960 --> 2:40:13.680]  years this one particularly for years and he was just saying that
[2:40:13.680 --> 2:40:16.960]  mismanagement was it was just gross negligence there's no
[2:40:16.960 --> 2:40:19.520]  way that it's purpose for it everybody got
[2:40:19.520 --> 2:40:23.680]  incentivized to kind of go along with it because their wages went up during
[2:40:23.680 --> 2:40:27.360]  that initial wave of uh the baloney 19 virus
[2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:31.200]  so i just wanted to say that you know i i don't agree with everything you say
[2:40:31.200 --> 2:40:34.400]  i definitely love you i don't have to agree with everything you say to
[2:40:34.400 --> 2:40:38.000]  to love you but that's something that's very true i mean the numbers are
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:41.680]  sir i disagree with myself sometimes so i hear you
[2:40:41.680 --> 2:40:45.120]  uh what else does you want to add sir i just want to say um
[2:40:45.120 --> 2:40:48.800]  obviously we see with our brain you know and that um
[2:40:48.800 --> 2:40:52.640]  like there's we get natural dmt from the breath of god
[2:40:52.640 --> 2:40:57.680]  and that the lungs create the precursors for dmt and when dmt you know with
[2:40:57.680 --> 2:41:01.840]  dreams or whatever you want to call it that's just uh a full spectrum view
[2:41:01.840 --> 2:41:04.720]  the light spectrum and they got us so worked up on race
[2:41:04.720 --> 2:41:08.320]  no i totally agree getting with god having good
[2:41:08.320 --> 2:41:12.640]  sleep doing good things releases dmt that literally is the chemical
[2:41:12.640 --> 2:41:15.760]  that opens up the dimension and gets us closer to god the problem is you take it
[2:41:15.760 --> 2:41:19.280]  in a mass dose it kind of shifts you into the bad area
[2:41:19.280 --> 2:41:23.120]  yeah because i mean sleep is just pretty much unconscious breath work and um
[2:41:23.120 --> 2:41:26.880]  i i know they got us so worked up on this racial issue and really there's just
[2:41:26.880 --> 2:41:29.760]  the humanity is an expression of the light spectrum
[2:41:29.760 --> 2:41:32.720]  you know like we all the shades nobody's really
[2:41:32.720 --> 2:41:35.600]  white really like your pink or brown or whatever your different shape or you
[2:41:35.600 --> 2:41:38.640]  could say everybody is black no you're right i mean i mean white
[2:41:38.640 --> 2:41:42.480]  is a total reflection of everything off black is an absorption of everything
[2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:45.520]  so black is all the colors and white is no colors
[2:41:45.520 --> 2:41:49.120]  i mean i i guess you could say that but the sun makes us darker so i would look
[2:41:49.120 --> 2:41:51.760]  at light no no i'm not here obviously all white people are
[2:41:51.760 --> 2:41:55.360]  are some form of other color and i get it there's no white people there's no
[2:41:55.360 --> 2:41:58.480]  black people we're all shit but i'm saying what you're saying is true
[2:41:58.480 --> 2:42:02.000]  is that white is the reflection of all light black is the absorption of all
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:05.760]  light so black is all the colors white is none of the colors
[2:42:05.760 --> 2:42:09.520]  yeah and everybody is a ratio to it so maybe there is one person that is
[2:42:09.520 --> 2:42:12.640]  almost absolutely white and somebody that's almost absolutely black but
[2:42:12.640 --> 2:42:16.960]  everybody in between is all the shades and if we are fighting over shades of
[2:42:16.960 --> 2:42:20.160]  of you know of light or however you want to let shade the darkness whatever
[2:42:20.160 --> 2:42:24.000]  we're just getting lost in that whole melee and it's just ridiculous when
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:27.680]  really the breath of god is what keeps everybody alive and what keeps
[2:42:27.680 --> 2:42:31.040]  everything going whether you black white or whatever you are the breath of god
[2:42:31.040 --> 2:42:34.560]  is what produces the dmt which produces the dreams and you could look at like
[2:42:34.560 --> 2:42:38.000]  i want to hear more about this because i've been trying to breathe more
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:41.600]  realizing i don't i do all that you you said i've been made me feel a lot i can
[2:42:41.600 --> 2:42:44.320]  literally breathe for like 10 minutes and totally get relaxed and not be
[2:42:44.320 --> 2:42:48.640]  depressed and that's so tell me about the breathing
[2:42:48.640 --> 2:42:51.680]  really like like like babies the way babies breathe is full diaphragmatic
[2:42:51.680 --> 2:42:55.120]  expansion and then um it's just when you get it creates
[2:42:55.120 --> 2:42:58.640]  that it helps you go into the parasympathetic nervous system
[2:42:58.640 --> 2:43:01.680]  and that's where we're dreaming that's where we're doing our healing
[2:43:01.680 --> 2:43:04.800]  and we're so worked up from adrenal fatigue and things like that
[2:43:04.800 --> 2:43:07.840]  that we're never really getting into the parasympathetic nervous system
[2:43:07.840 --> 2:43:11.120]  consciously that's why i say sleep is unconscious i tell you what let's get
[2:43:11.120 --> 2:43:15.120]  tail on for 30 minutes as a guest sorry i set him up and send me some notes what
[2:43:15.120 --> 2:43:17.440]  you want to talk about come on as a guest tail we love you i want to hear what

[2:53:55.040 --> 2:54:00.160]  going just like it was before any covid showed up i mean everything's open
[2:54:00.160 --> 2:54:03.280]  schools there's no no no china just launched the attack
[2:54:03.280 --> 2:54:07.040]  they're not shut down we're shut down forever that's how this works china's
[2:54:07.040 --> 2:54:11.680]  not shut down we're shut down forever yeah it's it's normal everything's back
[2:54:11.680 --> 2:54:14.160]  normal anyway i'm here's what i want to talk about is
[2:54:14.160 --> 2:54:18.320]  china oh china joe uh you know something that
[2:54:18.320 --> 2:54:22.080]  people need to go back to the beginning if they're not looking at that i don't
[2:54:22.080 --> 2:54:26.160]  think uh back when john carrey was uh uh
[2:54:26.160 --> 2:54:31.440]  pointed to secretary of state and then his son shows up oh chris hind
[2:54:31.440 --> 2:54:34.880]  then uh oh hunter biden he gets kicked out of the navy
[2:54:34.880 --> 2:54:39.600]  you know because he has a drug test he busted oh yeah by the way when he got
[2:54:39.600 --> 2:54:42.560]  into the navy they give him like a two-year uh
[2:54:42.560 --> 2:54:45.440]  dispensation because it's some kind of a drug problem
[2:54:45.440 --> 2:54:50.160]  he was 44 i think 42 is the maximum age then he goes in and gets the commission
[2:54:50.160 --> 2:54:53.920]  right off the bat you know it's dirty from the very beginning to
[2:54:53.920 --> 2:54:57.040]  now and don't forget who was secretary of state
[2:54:57.040 --> 2:55:00.960]  before john carrey yeah your favorite lady
[2:55:00.960 --> 2:55:04.320]  gilry clinton she just probably handed john carried the list and said here you
[2:55:04.320 --> 2:55:07.120]  go fill you up your duffel bags i think that's why
[2:55:07.120 --> 2:55:10.560]  hunter biden went to the navy so i could steal a bunch of duffel bags so i could
[2:55:10.560 --> 2:55:15.200]  fill him full of money but anyway if you start looking at that
[2:55:15.200 --> 2:55:18.880]  that situation there john carrey and and uh
[2:55:18.880 --> 2:55:22.560]  china joe were real good buddies when they were in the senate uh senate
[2:55:22.560 --> 2:55:26.480]  and after uh they got you know married up over there and
[2:55:26.480 --> 2:55:29.440]  and uh the secretary of state and vice president
[2:55:29.440 --> 2:55:34.880]  oh it was just a sharp fest you got around i couldn't say it better thank

[3:01:45.040 --> 3:01:49.840]  about this fake rudy juliani scandal that isn't a scandal that is solely
[3:01:49.840 --> 3:01:53.040]  designed to distract from the real sex scandal
[3:01:53.040 --> 3:01:58.080]  that being come to biden's laptop want to remind people by the way
[3:01:58.080 --> 3:02:01.600]  this seemed longer ago than it actually is it was actually only as recently as
[3:02:01.600 --> 3:02:05.360]  june that mr sasha baron cohen who has now
[3:02:05.360 --> 3:02:09.440]  interjected himself into a presidential election once again
[3:02:09.440 --> 3:02:14.400]  tried to pull another stunt this time at an event in olympia
[3:02:14.400 --> 3:02:17.600]  a march for our rights three which was a patriot
[3:02:17.600 --> 3:02:21.600]  conservative rally this is an article out of cnn
[3:02:21.600 --> 3:02:27.520]  bear in mind this one fell completely flat on its face it made him look stupid
[3:02:27.520 --> 3:02:30.480]  because it contradicted the entire narrative
[3:02:30.480 --> 3:02:33.680]  that he tries to push over and over again
[3:02:33.680 --> 3:02:37.120]  in these movies specifically in this borat movie
[3:02:37.120 --> 3:02:40.400]  the sequel of which apparently now as we've learned
[3:02:40.400 --> 3:02:44.960]  features this embarrassing incident with juliani of course the main drive of
[3:02:44.960 --> 3:02:48.960]  borat and these are the movies that baron cohen has been behind
[3:02:48.960 --> 3:02:55.520]  is to make conservatives look intolerant look racist look hateful by him
[3:02:55.520 --> 3:03:01.120]  acting out by him acting obnoxiously as a quote foreigner as an immigrant
[3:03:01.120 --> 3:03:04.160]  and then having them react in a negative intolerant way
[3:03:04.160 --> 3:03:07.920]  problem with that is that in the vast majority of cases
[3:03:07.920 --> 3:03:11.520]  even the ones in the movies it only turns out that the
[3:03:11.520 --> 3:03:15.360]  conservatives who he tries to provoke react
[3:03:15.360 --> 3:03:19.040]  in a patient tolerant way i mean how many
[3:03:19.040 --> 3:03:22.080]  video clips out of his movies have we seen where
[3:03:22.080 --> 3:03:27.040]  he sits there at dinner for an hour or two probably to gather the footage
[3:03:27.040 --> 3:03:30.720]  from the length of the clips we've seen and continually tries to provoke
[3:03:30.720 --> 3:03:33.520]  conservatives to say something outrageous
[3:03:33.520 --> 3:03:37.840]  to attack him personally either because he's a quote foreigner in the case of
[3:03:37.840 --> 3:03:41.440]  the borat character or gay in the case of the
[3:03:41.440 --> 3:03:45.760]  Bruno character as we saw in the clip that was just played there
[3:03:45.760 --> 3:03:49.840]  problem is it falls flat on its face almost every time cnn headline from
[3:03:49.840 --> 3:03:53.840]  june a right-wing group got pranked at a rally
[3:03:53.840 --> 3:03:57.440]  and they believe sasha baron cohen is behind it now this
[3:03:57.440 --> 3:04:00.640]  was on twitter for a probably a matter of hours
[3:04:00.640 --> 3:04:05.440]  back in june and it disappeared quite quickly because it obviously fell flat
[3:04:05.440 --> 3:04:08.880]  on its face basically what happened is they had
[3:04:08.880 --> 3:04:12.160]  this march for our rights three rally in olympia
[3:04:12.160 --> 3:04:15.440]  they had a little stage where people gave speeches
[3:04:15.440 --> 3:04:21.200]  then sasha baron cohen who was dressed up in this instance as the stereotypical
[3:04:21.200 --> 3:04:28.640]  intolerant racist redneck got upon stage and started ranting spouting racist
[3:04:28.640 --> 3:04:32.640]  platitudes the problem is he was obviously
[3:04:32.640 --> 3:04:36.160]  intending to make fools out of the audience the
[3:04:36.160 --> 3:04:40.480]  organizers of this patriot rally because he probably expected
[3:04:40.480 --> 3:04:46.800]  to whoop holler and cheer he's an adl anti-free speech u n rat trying to frame
[3:04:46.800 --> 3:04:49.680]  republicans and he keeps blowing up his face but what about him pulling his
[3:04:49.680 --> 3:04:52.480]  pants down on ron paul it's the same crap with juliani
[3:04:52.480 --> 3:04:55.520]  there's a 20 year old woman saying it's his daughter going this room she's
[3:04:55.520 --> 3:04:58.400]  jumping on him and now it's his fault
[3:04:58.400 --> 3:05:02.720]  yeah and if you've seen the pictures of this who he was told was a 15 year old
[3:05:02.720 --> 3:05:06.080]  she's obviously in her mid 20s you can see that from the pictures
[3:05:06.080 --> 3:05:11.200]  he was taking off his bike and tucking his shirt into his pants that's
[3:05:11.200 --> 3:05:14.320]  clearly what happened and yet we have headlines
[3:05:14.320 --> 3:05:19.440]  saying that juliani now was trying to solicit sex from a 15 year old girl
[3:05:19.440 --> 3:05:22.880]  the girl wasn't 15 she's an actress in her mid 20s
[3:05:22.880 --> 3:05:25.760]  and also the other aspect of this of course
[3:05:25.760 --> 3:05:29.680]  is we've had this big censorship controversy over the past week about
[3:05:29.680 --> 3:05:35.040]  leaked information quote unconfirmed information from hunter biden's laptop
[3:05:35.040 --> 3:05:39.520]  and that being the sole reason for the new york post for example
[3:05:39.520 --> 3:05:43.040]  still being locked out of it but twitter has no problem with this i'm
[3:05:43.040 --> 3:05:47.120]  substantiated crap yeah and many people have made the
[3:05:47.120 --> 3:05:50.800]  point alex that this could indeed break uh revenge
[3:05:50.800 --> 3:05:55.440]  porn laws in new york many people are making that point right now
[3:05:55.440 --> 3:05:58.720]  in fact i've got a couple of tweets emails chong tweets
[3:05:58.720 --> 3:06:03.280]  borat tried to make it look like juliani was soliciting sex from a
[3:06:03.280 --> 3:06:06.960]  minor by running into a room claiming a 24 25 year old
[3:06:06.960 --> 3:06:10.480]  actress was 15 in reality he wasn't soliciting sex from her the
[3:06:10.480 --> 3:06:15.760]  democrats will sink to incredible lows jack perso big makes the point
[3:06:15.760 --> 3:06:19.840]  twitter will allow unlawful dissemination of intimate photos of rudy
[3:06:19.840 --> 3:06:22.800]  juliani but censored everyone who shared the new
[3:06:22.800 --> 3:06:27.440]  york post factual story about biden's foreign corruption
[3:06:27.440 --> 3:06:30.400]  so a bunch of people making the point that this
[3:06:30.400 --> 3:06:33.680]  stun this apparent prank is actually a violation of
[3:06:33.680 --> 3:06:37.600]  revenge porn laws but twitter's doing nothing to censor it because we know
[3:06:37.600 --> 3:06:42.080]  what team they're on don't go away we'll be right back the future isn't coming
[3:06:42.080 --> 3:06:46.320]  it's here and in the future keeping your humanity
[3:06:46.320 --> 3:06:50.240]  saving your soul your integrity your very essence
[3:06:50.240 --> 3:06:54.000]  is going to be your most valuable asset in fact it's going to be your
[3:06:54.000 --> 3:06:58.240]  only asset the world being built by the technocrats
[3:06:58.240 --> 3:07:03.120]  the trap they've now sprung is coven 19 and the endless lockdown
[3:07:03.120 --> 3:07:07.760]  is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication
[3:07:07.760 --> 3:07:13.120]  into total and complete dehumanization human life will be
[3:07:13.120 --> 3:07:17.680]  impossible to be carried out in an original biological way
[3:07:17.680 --> 3:07:21.920]  by the year 2050 this is their stated goal
[3:07:21.920 --> 3:07:26.000]  i'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you but only
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:30.800]  by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy
[3:07:30.800 --> 3:07:34.240]  we turn this around you must study their own writings
[3:07:34.240 --> 3:07:37.680]  you must face the facts and you must come to grips with it
[3:07:37.680 --> 3:07:41.440]  you're all being incrementally destroyed as i taped this announcement we were
[3:07:41.440 --> 3:07:46.880]  exactly 14 days out from the election and the globalist controlled democrats
[3:07:46.880 --> 3:07:50.640]  know that america has woken up to them and turned against them the whole planet
[3:07:50.640 --> 3:07:54.480]  is a huge populace realignment and so they've openly said
[3:07:54.480 --> 3:07:58.560]  we need to go to pure authoritarianism not just censorship but physically
[3:07:58.560 --> 3:08:02.160]  attacking and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our
[3:08:02.160 --> 3:08:05.200]  agenda and they're on record saying that once they
[3:08:05.200 --> 3:08:07.760]  remove trump they are going to persecute
[3:08:07.760 --> 3:08:12.160]  trumps base and going to try to prosecute as it put us all in prison
[3:08:12.160 --> 3:08:16.160]  this is what all the old clinton easters are saying it's what the obama
[3:08:16.160 --> 3:08:19.280]  bots are saying it's what keith oberman saying it's what
[3:08:19.280 --> 3:08:25.760]  ansie bloce is saying this is their stated criminal authoritarian intent
[3:08:25.760 --> 3:08:29.360]  and they intend to keep the lockdowns going forever and forced inoculations
[3:08:29.360 --> 3:08:32.880]  trump is trying to end the lockdowns and the sick vaccines will be
[3:08:32.880 --> 3:08:38.000]  voluntary donald trump or die we've got to get trump in everybody get out there
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:41.520]  and vote and tell your family to vote now
[3:08:41.520 --> 3:08:50.880]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:08:52.880 --> 3:08:59.280]  transmitting worldwide from the summit dot new studios in the united kingdom
[3:08:59.280 --> 3:09:05.600]  you're listening to paul joseph watson
[3:09:05.600 --> 3:09:09.360]  so the very same mainstream media and social media
[3:09:09.360 --> 3:09:12.720]  that has either blacklisted or censored completely
[3:09:12.720 --> 3:09:16.800]  the very real evidence of criminal activity regarding hunter biden's
[3:09:16.800 --> 3:09:20.240]  laptop potentially involving miners has now
[3:09:20.240 --> 3:09:24.640]  flooded the narrative with this supposed bombshell scandal
[3:09:24.640 --> 3:09:28.480]  where rudy juliani took his shirt into his pants
[3:09:28.480 --> 3:09:32.400]  yes this could swing the election the other way this is so bombshell so
[3:09:32.400 --> 3:09:36.480]  incredible apparently oh by the way you know every time project
[3:09:36.480 --> 3:09:39.920]  veritas and james o' keith released a video of which we're going to play
[3:09:39.920 --> 3:09:43.680]  another one later today in terms of insiders whistleblowers
[3:09:43.680 --> 3:09:47.600]  within google and other social media companies what does the media do
[3:09:47.600 --> 3:09:51.200]  what do they say in response all the videos
[3:09:51.200 --> 3:09:55.600]  edited it's edited it's taken out of context therefore
[3:09:55.600 --> 3:10:01.840]  it's completely unreliable but then you get one screenshot from rudy juliani
[3:10:01.840 --> 3:10:05.600]  on a bed in a hotel room taking his shirt into his pants
[3:10:05.600 --> 3:10:08.880]  and suddenly i'm seeing tweets and i'm seeing headlines
[3:10:08.880 --> 3:10:12.560]  seriously charging rudy juliani with attempting to
[3:10:12.560 --> 3:10:17.680]  solicit sex with a 15 year old the girl isn't 15 she's an actress in her mid
[3:10:17.680 --> 3:10:22.480]  20s and he was tucking his shirt into his pants but apparently within a space
[3:10:22.480 --> 3:10:25.760]  of an hour that's now soliciting sex from a
[3:10:25.760 --> 3:10:29.520]  miner this is how the democrats work of course
[3:10:29.520 --> 3:10:33.680]  their stunt didn't work back in june as i mentioned before the break
[3:10:33.680 --> 3:10:37.040]  when sasha baron cohen tried to prank a
[3:10:37.040 --> 3:10:42.480]  patriot rally in olympia by getting up on stage and spouting racist platitudes
[3:10:42.480 --> 3:10:45.520]  expecting the audience to cheer and support him
[3:10:45.520 --> 3:10:49.440]  what they actually did was cut his mic and drag him off the stage
[3:10:49.440 --> 3:10:53.920]  kind of disproving his entire narrative his entire setup as he went into that
[3:10:53.920 --> 3:10:59.360]  prank that failed but now he's back and coincidentally he's back
[3:10:59.360 --> 3:11:03.040]  what is it one day after rudy juliani said that the bombshells regard in
[3:11:03.040 --> 3:11:07.280]  hunter biden's laptop are going to come day after day
[3:11:07.280 --> 3:11:11.120]  suddenly now rudy juliani finds himself at the center of a scandal well
[3:11:11.120 --> 3:11:16.000]  it's almost like they timed it headline out of the guardian
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:22.000]  rudy juliani faces questions questions after compromising scene in new borat
[3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:26.080]  film and again borat is a character who in the first
[3:11:26.080 --> 3:11:30.080]  film tries to provoke conservatives into doing
[3:11:30.080 --> 3:11:33.200]  racist intolerant things throughout the entire movie
[3:11:33.200 --> 3:11:37.040]  and yet throughout the entire movie the vast majority
[3:11:37.040 --> 3:11:41.360]  are just nice welcoming people oh my god owned
[3:11:41.360 --> 3:11:45.360]  owned so they've tried to go a step beyond with this
[3:11:45.360 --> 3:11:49.600]  says the reputation of rudy juliani could be set for a further blow
[3:11:49.600 --> 3:11:52.960]  with the release of highly embarrassing footage and sasha baron cohen's follow
[3:11:52.960 --> 3:11:56.480]  up to borat sasha baron cohen by the way who
[3:11:56.480 --> 3:12:00.720]  uses his right to free speech to set up all these pranks
[3:12:00.720 --> 3:12:05.440]  to claim that a girl's 15 and send her apparently into a prank that involved a
[3:12:05.440 --> 3:12:09.520]  sexual situation which as commentators on twitter are now
[3:12:09.520 --> 3:12:12.080]  suggesting that could be a crime in and of itself
[3:12:12.080 --> 3:12:15.280]  but that's okay for him to exercise his free speech
[3:12:15.280 --> 3:12:18.240]  you want your free speech though ain't gonna happen
[3:12:18.240 --> 3:12:22.880]  he gets up in front of adl conferences and says that alex jones needs to be
[3:12:22.880 --> 3:12:25.120]  banned everybody else needs to be silenced
[3:12:25.120 --> 3:12:28.960]  apart from him despite the fact that people are making
[3:12:28.960 --> 3:12:32.800]  very serious allegations now that he could have in fact committed a crime by
[3:12:32.800 --> 3:12:36.640]  overseeing this prank says in the film
[3:12:36.640 --> 3:12:39.760]  released on friday the former new york mayor and current personal attorney to
[3:12:39.760 --> 3:12:43.120]  donald trump is seen reaching into his trousers and apparently touching his
[3:12:43.120 --> 3:12:47.440]  genitals apparently they use the word apparently because
[3:12:47.440 --> 3:12:52.000]  the photos don't actually show that while reclining on a bed in the presence
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:56.400]  of the actor playing borat's daughter is posing as a tv journalist
[3:12:56.400 --> 3:13:00.800]  again the idea that a 15 year old would be a tv journalist is
[3:13:00.800 --> 3:13:04.720]  inexplicable in many ways following an obsequious interview for a fake
[3:13:04.720 --> 3:13:08.880]  conservative news program the parietary her suggestion for drink to the
[3:13:08.880 --> 3:13:12.960]  bedroom of a hotel suite which is rigged with concealed cameras
[3:13:12.960 --> 3:13:17.600]  now i think the the biggest charge that you can level against juliani is that
[3:13:17.600 --> 3:13:22.640]  he's an idiot and that how was he not noticed for one that this is borat
[3:13:22.640 --> 3:13:27.520]  unless he hadn't actually met sasha baron co in playing borat before this
[3:13:27.520 --> 3:13:31.440]  whole stunt was set up and yes obviously going to a
[3:13:31.440 --> 3:13:35.840]  hotel room with a woman who is obviously in her mid 20s someone who you've
[3:13:35.840 --> 3:13:39.600]  just met kind of might have rang some alarm
[3:13:39.600 --> 3:13:41.920]  bells but that's that's probably what we can
[3:13:41.920 --> 3:13:44.640]  charge him with at this point is being an idiot
[3:13:44.640 --> 3:13:49.920]  continues to say after she removes his microphone juliani 76 can be seen lying
[3:13:49.920 --> 3:13:54.240]  back on the bed fiddling with his untucked shirt and reaching into his trousers
[3:13:54.240 --> 3:13:58.320]  again they don't mention the fact that he's tucking his shirt in
[3:13:58.320 --> 3:14:01.440]  they mentioned the fact that he removed his microphone but then obviously if
[3:14:01.440 --> 3:14:04.240]  you remove the microphone then you have to readjust your clothing
[3:14:04.240 --> 3:14:07.680]  that's obviously what happened here and but they
[3:14:07.680 --> 3:14:11.200]  yet they literally spin it as soliciting sex with a 15 year old
[3:14:11.200 --> 3:14:14.960]  i've seen actual headlines i'm sure they're
[3:14:14.960 --> 3:14:18.240]  feverishly editing them as we speak given juliani's
[3:14:18.240 --> 3:14:22.800]  reputation as an aggressive prosecutor going to be a lawsuit city by the end
[3:14:22.800 --> 3:14:26.000]  of this they are then interrupted by borat who
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:29.920]  runs in says she's 15 she's too old for you
[3:14:29.920 --> 3:14:33.200]  representatives of juliani have not replied to the guardians request for
[3:14:33.200 --> 3:14:38.640]  common now bearing in mind this is a guy in sasha baron co in
[3:14:38.640 --> 3:14:42.400]  who has been protected by the establishment to such an extent and for
[3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:46.720]  such an extended period of time over the past 20 years
[3:14:46.720 --> 3:14:52.880]  plus that he is basically from my memory the only
[3:14:52.880 --> 3:14:58.000]  person who can culturally appropriate in the past
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:02.880]  both black people and gay people and get away with it in the present
[3:15:02.880 --> 3:15:07.360]  of course we've had numerous instances of people like jimmy kimmel doing black
[3:15:07.360 --> 3:15:10.960]  face then having to grovel and apologize for it 20 years
[3:15:10.960 --> 3:15:15.440]  later we've had actresses and actors who are
[3:15:15.440 --> 3:15:19.440]  scheduled to play the parts of lgbt characters
[3:15:19.440 --> 3:15:23.120]  because they're not personally gay or transgender themselves
[3:15:23.120 --> 3:15:27.200]  they then almost get cancelled by social media or they have to withdraw from the
[3:15:27.200 --> 3:15:31.520]  role same thing didn't happen to sasha baron co in
[3:15:31.520 --> 3:15:36.480]  now i know that he didn't black up for his ali g character this was a
[3:15:36.480 --> 3:15:40.400]  character on british comedy television about 20 years ago
[3:15:40.400 --> 3:15:44.640]  22 years ago but again he adopted all the mannerisms
[3:15:44.640 --> 3:15:49.760]  all the patois of a black person while being a white person basically playing
[3:15:49.760 --> 3:15:53.520]  a black character he doesn't get cancelled he
[3:15:53.520 --> 3:15:56.720]  doesn't get retrospectively cancelled for that
[3:15:56.720 --> 3:16:02.640]  then of course he released a movie i think it was in 2000 2009 actually
[3:16:02.640 --> 3:16:07.200]  called bruno where he plays this outrageous gay character that was the
[3:16:07.200 --> 3:16:10.160]  clip you saw previously where they tried to entrap
[3:16:10.160 --> 3:16:13.600]  ron paul so he can play this outrageous offensive
[3:16:13.600 --> 3:16:17.360]  gay character riffing off all these supposed
[3:16:17.360 --> 3:16:21.440]  gay stereotypes that were supposed to issue now and are supposed to be
[3:16:21.440 --> 3:16:28.240]  part of the ancient past but he can get away with that as recently as 2009
[3:16:28.240 --> 3:16:33.040]  and not get retrospectively cancelled like a lot of other people have happened
[3:16:33.040 --> 3:16:39.120]  like actors and actresses have been hounded by social media mobs merely for
[3:16:39.120 --> 3:16:42.880]  scheduling themselves or being approached or accepting a role as a gay
[3:16:42.880 --> 3:16:46.080]  character in a movie when they're not personally gay
[3:16:46.080 --> 3:16:50.160]  they can't get away with it but sasha baron co in can
[3:16:50.160 --> 3:16:54.080]  hmm gee i wonder why that is
[3:16:54.080 --> 3:16:59.520]  scandal has been released without any context without any
[3:16:59.520 --> 3:17:03.680]  discussion of the fact that this is obviously edited the explanation is
[3:17:03.680 --> 3:17:07.520]  there that he's removing the mic he's
[3:17:15.680 --> 3:17:20.640]  the hunter biden laptop scandal by the big media networks it's basically
[3:17:20.640 --> 3:17:25.360]  zero we've seen twitter facebook censored the very real scandal
[3:17:25.360 --> 3:17:29.360]  criminal scandal of hunter biden's laptop they've ignored it they've
[3:17:29.360 --> 3:17:32.720]  blacklisted it they've censored it and now they've replaced it with this
[3:17:32.720 --> 3:17:38.320]  scandal which is a complete non-scandal
[3:17:38.560 --> 3:17:42.240]  vitamin mineral fusion and ultra 12 are now
[3:17:42.240 --> 3:17:45.760]  back in stock it's being sold out for months they're sold out because people
[3:17:45.760 --> 3:17:49.120]  know that high quality b12 and a good mix of vitamins minerals

[3:18:34.000 --> 3:18:39.120]  to fight and you've helped win the war against the global so far
[3:18:39.120 --> 3:18:43.600]  in fiction super villains are known as super villains because they have
[3:18:43.600 --> 3:18:48.240]  gigantic huge global plants that are incredibly well thought
[3:18:48.240 --> 3:18:52.480]  out and incredibly complex and about it told you a year ago back in October
[3:18:52.480 --> 3:18:57.760]  of 2019 that a powerful billionaire who controls the un would roll out a global
[3:18:57.760 --> 3:19:01.520]  hysteria and lock down the planet star billions of people and
[3:19:01.520 --> 3:19:04.640]  would be pushing a forced inoculation to even be able to
[3:19:04.640 --> 3:19:07.760]  leave your houses and that this same billionaire would say we're all going to
[3:19:07.760 --> 3:19:11.520]  work from home now and that this was good to lower the carbon
[3:19:11.520 --> 3:19:15.520]  footprint and the human population you tell me that's crazy you tell me that's
[3:19:15.520 --> 3:19:18.880]  a dystopia you tell me that's some type of science fiction
[3:19:18.880 --> 3:19:22.080]  comic book but in reality it really did happen
[3:19:22.080 --> 3:19:26.000]  his name is bill gates and he's the head of a major eugenics
[3:19:26.000 --> 3:19:30.560]  consortium that his father and mother set up more than 60 years ago
[3:19:30.560 --> 3:19:34.400]  and we're living in this world bill gates is built until we start saying no
[3:19:34.400 --> 3:19:38.720]  we are bill gates's property it's time to expose bill gates

[3:20:11.760 --> 3:20:15.040]  overrode them four years ago trump has finally figured this out
[3:20:15.040 --> 3:20:18.480]  since he's going to take action once reelected against big tech and then
[3:20:18.480 --> 3:20:21.440]  he's modern in the situation well we know the president's overwhelmed right now

[3:20:50.560 --> 3:20:54.160]  you're listening to the summit.news radio hour
[3:20:54.160 --> 3:20:59.360]  with paul joseph watson
[3:21:00.800 --> 3:21:04.320]  and we are back i'm gonna move on down and talk about
[3:21:04.320 --> 3:21:08.880]  lockdown and the fact that this imposition the greatest imposition on our
[3:21:08.880 --> 3:21:13.360]  liberties in peacetime memory specifically in the united kingdom
[3:21:13.360 --> 3:21:16.960]  continues to accelerate and indeed continues to accelerate across the
[3:21:16.960 --> 3:21:19.760]  world earlier today we had the shocking and
[3:21:19.760 --> 3:21:24.240]  tragic headline australia four newborn babies die after being
[3:21:24.240 --> 3:21:28.640]  denied heart surgery due to covid travel rules
[3:21:28.640 --> 3:21:32.160]  will this be a big story or will it disappear it's already disappeared let's
[3:21:32.160 --> 3:21:36.240]  be honest four newborn babies in adelaide australia have died
[3:21:36.240 --> 3:21:40.320]  after being denied life-saving heart surgery due to coronavirus travel
[3:21:40.320 --> 3:21:45.680]  restrictions what happened is that these babies in
[3:21:45.680 --> 3:21:49.200]  adelaide these sick ill babies who needed treatment
[3:21:49.200 --> 3:21:52.880]  were in a city the only mainland australian capital that doesn't provide
[3:21:52.880 --> 3:21:57.360]  pediatric cardiac surgery so they have to send around a hundred
[3:21:57.360 --> 3:22:01.040]  babies a year from adelaide over to melbourne
[3:22:01.040 --> 3:22:06.560]  to get this vital life-saving treatment problem being is that now in australia
[3:22:06.560 --> 3:22:09.680]  where they have a lockdown you're not allowed to travel
[3:22:09.680 --> 3:22:14.240]  from adelaide to melbourne and they're having to send these babies
[3:22:14.240 --> 3:22:17.840]  more than double from what i saw in terms of the distance
[3:22:17.840 --> 3:22:22.640]  double the travel distance over to sydney so these babies aren't getting
[3:22:22.640 --> 3:22:26.480]  treatment and four of them just this past month alone
[3:22:26.480 --> 3:22:31.840]  have died specifically because of coronavirus lockdown restrictions
[3:22:31.840 --> 3:22:35.440]  professor john svegos said four babies who had died in adelaide
[3:22:35.440 --> 3:22:38.160]  in the past month have been unable to be transferred and would have
[3:22:38.160 --> 3:22:42.160]  almost certainly benefited from on-site surgery
[3:22:42.160 --> 3:22:46.240]  now we've made the point we've cited the experts over and over again
[3:22:46.240 --> 3:22:49.920]  the lockdown the lockdown restrictions will end up killing
[3:22:49.920 --> 3:22:55.280]  more people than the virus itself and we're already starting to see that
[3:22:55.280 --> 3:22:58.960]  germany's minister of economic cooperation and development
[3:22:58.960 --> 3:23:02.320]  gerd muller warned recently that lockdown measures
[3:23:02.320 --> 3:23:06.080]  throughout the globe will end up killing more people than the coronavirus itself
[3:23:06.080 --> 3:23:09.920]  he cites 400 000 deaths from bilaria and hiv
[3:23:09.920 --> 3:23:14.240]  on the african continent alone oh but i thought progressives
[3:23:14.240 --> 3:23:21.120]  really cared about black people 400 000 of them dead keep wearing your mask
[3:23:21.120 --> 3:23:25.760]  he added that half a million more will die from tuberculosis
[3:23:25.760 --> 3:23:28.880]  this came after a leaked study from inside the german ministry of the
[3:23:28.880 --> 3:23:32.400]  interior which revealed that the impact of the country's lockdown
[3:23:32.400 --> 3:23:36.160]  could end up killing more people than the coronavirus itself
[3:23:36.160 --> 3:23:41.680]  again due to victims of other serious illnesses not receiving treatment
[3:23:41.680 --> 3:23:45.920]  nobody ever talks about it yet the death toll continues to climb
[3:23:45.920 --> 3:23:51.040]  higher and higher we have professor richard sullivan out of the uk who warned
[3:23:51.040 --> 3:23:53.360]  that there will be more excess cancer deaths
[3:23:53.360 --> 3:23:57.120]  in the uk alone than total coronavirus deaths
[3:23:57.120 --> 3:24:01.200]  again because people are either having their treatments cancelled by the
[3:24:01.200 --> 3:24:04.480]  hospital while the nurses do tiktok dancing videos because that's way more
[3:24:04.480 --> 3:24:08.000]  important or they've been petrified by the
[3:24:08.000 --> 3:24:11.040]  hysterical media into thinking that if they leave their
[3:24:11.040 --> 3:24:14.240]  homes they're going to catch coronavirus and die
[3:24:14.240 --> 3:24:18.400]  despite the fact that even for example in the case of someone like donald
[3:24:18.400 --> 3:24:23.920]  trump who is overweight and 74 years old his chances of surviving
[3:24:23.920 --> 3:24:28.400]  coronavirus were 96 plus and obviously he beat it within a
[3:24:28.400 --> 3:24:32.320]  matter of days that's reality is not being echoed
[3:24:32.320 --> 3:24:35.840]  in the mainstream media to the point where for example in america
[3:24:35.840 --> 3:24:41.920]  the average american thinks 30 million americans have died of coronavirus they
[3:24:41.920 --> 3:24:45.680]  literally believe that that's what the average that's not the
[3:24:45.680 --> 3:24:50.080]  far end of the spectrum that's what the average american believes some of them
[3:24:50.080 --> 3:24:55.600]  believe it's killed more than 30 million similar case in the uk
[3:24:55.600 --> 3:24:59.520]  where we've had under 50 000 coronavirus deaths of course the vast majority of
[3:24:59.520 --> 3:25:02.560]  whom had comorbidities and unfortunately would have died anyway
[3:25:02.560 --> 3:25:06.000]  but they just put covid on the death certificate
[3:25:06.000 --> 3:25:11.360]  where people think five million people have died in the united kingdom purely
[3:25:11.360 --> 3:25:16.880]  because of media hysteria experts have also warned
[3:25:16.880 --> 3:25:21.840]  that there will be 1.4 million deaths globally from untreated tb infections
[3:25:21.840 --> 3:25:25.680]  due to the lockdown but the vast majority of those people are in the third
[3:25:25.680 --> 3:25:29.760]  world so i guess we don't give a damn do we we're so progressive
[3:25:29.760 --> 3:25:34.080]  as we previously highlighted a data analyst consortium in south africa
[3:25:34.080 --> 3:25:37.920]  found that the economic consequences of the country's lockdown will lead to 29
[3:25:37.920 --> 3:25:40.560]  times more people dying than the coronavirus itself
[3:25:40.560 --> 3:25:45.360]  and that was a minimal equation it's probably going to be hundreds of times
[3:25:45.360 --> 3:25:48.880]  more and in terms of years shaved off lives
[3:25:48.880 --> 3:25:53.920]  the lockdown will cause massively more years to be shaved off lives
[3:25:53.920 --> 3:25:58.720]  than the virus itself we've been telling you about this for the past six months
[3:25:58.720 --> 3:26:01.280]  has it been adopted into government policy
[3:26:01.280 --> 3:26:06.080]  no they're making the lockdowns even more draconian
[3:26:06.080 --> 3:26:11.280]  despite the fact that all the graphs show the lockdowns have made infections even
[3:26:11.280 --> 3:26:16.400]  worse g i wonder if people wearing masks touching masks then
[3:26:16.400 --> 3:26:20.800]  touching surfaces all the time is actually driving more infections but
[3:26:20.800 --> 3:26:23.440]  you can't talk about that because you get banned immediately
[3:26:23.440 --> 3:26:27.920]  50 000 children's surgeries postponed this is out of bright spot
[3:26:27.920 --> 3:26:32.560]  deaths on transplant waiting lists near double due to lockdown
[3:26:32.560 --> 3:26:37.040]  the uk's coronavirus lockdown has impacted every area of healthcare
[3:26:37.040 --> 3:26:40.400]  now the office for national statistics figures have revealed
[3:26:40.400 --> 3:26:44.320]  there were 25 000 excess deaths at private homes
[3:26:44.320 --> 3:26:48.080]  since the beginning of the year with only nine percent being as a result of
[3:26:48.080 --> 3:26:51.920]  coronavirus and in fact if you look at the graphs
[3:26:51.920 --> 3:26:56.400]  the five-year average which i tweeted out earlier
[3:26:56.400 --> 3:27:00.080]  the average for deaths over the past
[3:27:00.080 --> 3:27:03.200]  several weeks in fact from what i'm looking at the graph over the past
[3:27:03.200 --> 3:27:07.760]  15 to 20 weeks the average deaths per week are lower
[3:27:07.760 --> 3:27:11.440]  than the five-year average and that's even accounting
[3:27:11.440 --> 3:27:16.480]  for coronavirus deaths deaths from flu and pneumonia have gone down over the
[3:27:16.480 --> 3:27:20.240]  past six weeks or so and yet we're fed this narrative in the
[3:27:20.240 --> 3:27:24.480]  media there you see the graph there those are the current average deaths in the
[3:27:24.480 --> 3:27:28.880]  united kingdom the blue line and the orange
[3:27:28.880 --> 3:27:32.960]  line kind of looks like normal doesn't it but no we're told by the mainstream
[3:27:32.960 --> 3:27:35.920]  media the hospitals are being overwhelmed they're
[3:27:35.920 --> 3:27:38.880]  going to have to put people in corridors there's going to be death on a
[3:27:38.880 --> 3:27:43.280]  massive scale unless we put everyone under house arrest
[3:27:43.280 --> 3:27:47.760]  oh but it's not called house arrest is it it's not even called lockdown anymore
[3:27:47.760 --> 3:27:51.680]  it's called a circuit breaker and it's only
[3:27:51.680 --> 3:27:55.280]  it's only for two weeks no we lied it's for three weeks no it's for six weeks
[3:27:55.280 --> 3:27:59.040]  no it's for six months stay in your homes
[3:27:59.040 --> 3:28:02.400]  even though the hospitals are not at capacity and they've been caught lying
[3:28:02.400 --> 3:28:05.840]  time and time again saying that for example in
[3:28:05.840 --> 3:28:10.640]  manchester which has just introduced the strictest circuit breaker which is
[3:28:10.640 --> 3:28:14.240]  just another lockdown lying to the public saying that
[3:28:14.240 --> 3:28:18.160]  hospitals are overstretched that they're way over capacity
[3:28:18.160 --> 3:28:22.400]  when people pointed out that the actual capacity for hospital beds in
[3:28:22.400 --> 3:28:25.520]  manchester was lower than normal compared to
[3:28:25.520 --> 3:28:29.760]  october 2019 they still continue to claim that they were over
[3:28:29.760 --> 3:28:34.800]  capacity meanwhile lockdown skeptics.org
[3:28:34.800 --> 3:28:39.680]  in its post from today says lockdown's lethal death toll
[3:28:39.680 --> 3:28:44.000]  award-winning investigative journalist david rose wrote a sensational front page
[3:28:44.000 --> 3:28:47.760]  story for the mail documenting the scale of the collateral
[3:28:47.760 --> 3:28:52.320]  damage to public health caused by the lockdown and the continuing restrictions
[3:28:52.320 --> 3:28:56.240]  he's brought together more than 130 studies
[3:28:56.240 --> 3:28:59.360]  and the article documented the impact of this disastrous policy on the
[3:28:59.360 --> 3:29:02.560]  every sphere of health including cancer, heart disease, addiction, the
[3:29:02.560 --> 3:29:06.000]  welfare of children, domestic violence and mental illness
[3:29:06.000 --> 3:29:10.800]  among the revelations are the following delays in treatment are set to cause a
[3:29:10.800 --> 3:29:14.160]  20 rising deaths among newly diagnosed cancer
[3:29:14.160 --> 3:29:18.640]  patients in england 6,270 excess deaths this year
[3:29:18.640 --> 3:29:21.280]  again because people aren't getting treatment their appointments are getting
[3:29:21.280 --> 3:29:24.560]  cancelled or they're afraid to go into the hospital
[3:29:24.560 --> 3:29:28.720]  treatment for strokes fell by 45 percent during lockdown
[3:29:28.720 --> 3:29:32.160]  and there were more than 2,000 excess deaths from heart disease
[3:29:32.160 --> 3:29:36.480]  more than 50,000 operations for children were cancelled
[3:29:36.480 --> 3:29:39.920]  you also have this thing where they're saying the kids aren't getting their
[3:29:39.920 --> 3:29:43.040]  vaccines i thought i thought the progressive caring
[3:29:43.040 --> 3:29:46.320]  bill gates left loved loved their childhood vaccines
[3:29:46.320 --> 3:29:49.520]  they're not getting them anymore maybe that's not such a bad thing
[3:29:49.520 --> 3:29:53.280]  organ transplants fell by two-thirds with the number of those who died on the
[3:29:53.280 --> 3:29:56.960]  transplant waiting list almost doubling total waiting list for
[3:29:56.960 --> 3:29:59.680]  routine orthopedic and eye operations and record levels
[3:29:59.680 --> 3:30:03.200]  caused to child abuse helplines rocketed
[3:30:03.200 --> 3:30:08.720]  of course domestic abuse incidents have also rocketed as we've seen over the
[3:30:08.720 --> 3:30:12.080]  past six months rates of depression and anxiety
[3:30:12.080 --> 3:30:15.600]  doubled thousands of recovering alcoholics have relapsed
[3:30:15.600 --> 3:30:20.560]  and i think the last count on the prescription of anti-depressant drugs
[3:30:20.560 --> 3:30:26.720]  in the united states was a rise of 86 percent which is obviously a sign that
[3:30:26.720 --> 3:30:29.920]  we're going to see tragically way more suicides
[3:30:29.920 --> 3:30:33.680]  because of this disastrous lockdown policy that will end up killing more
[3:30:33.680 --> 3:30:37.280]  people than covid-19 summit.news don't go away we'll be back
[3:30:37.280 --> 3:30:41.840]  i've got some really important and quite frankly bad news for you
[3:30:41.840 --> 3:30:45.360]  we've confirmed from high-level sources in our own research that if joe biden is
[3:30:45.360 --> 3:30:47.520]  able to steal the election and they're going to really try to do it they're
[3:30:47.520 --> 3:30:50.400]  that crazy they intend to not just shut down
[3:30:50.400 --> 3:30:53.280]  info wars but have yours truly Alex Jones arrested
[3:30:53.280 --> 3:30:56.560]  and here's the really bad news they're coming after everybody and they're
[3:30:56.560 --> 3:31:00.160]  coming after the economy and they want to totally gut it and punish
[3:31:00.160 --> 3:31:03.760]  americans for supporting donald trump and repudiating hollywood and all the
[3:31:03.760 --> 3:31:07.440]  trash but here's the really good news the really good news
[3:31:07.440 --> 3:31:11.760]  humanity is awakening to this threat we're no longer asleep
[3:31:11.760 --> 3:31:15.760]  and we understand that the globals are our mortal enemies and we fundamentally
[3:31:15.760 --> 3:31:18.720]  understand that they're trying to end our nation and the free market
[3:31:18.720 --> 3:31:24.240]  and our judaeo-christian roots forever that's why we must come together now as
[3:31:24.240 --> 3:31:28.000]  americans every race color and creed and repudiate the new world order
[3:31:28.000 --> 3:31:32.800]  and stand firm and vote for donald trump but also the information war support

[3:32:45.920 --> 3:32:49.680]  what donald trump understands we are in a digital
[3:32:49.680 --> 3:32:54.720]  civil war there are giant filters filtering out 99 percent of communication
[3:32:54.720 --> 3:32:58.640]  going on on every major tech platform and now they're doing it
[3:32:58.640 --> 3:33:02.720]  to the private apps they're doing it to text messages they're doing it
[3:33:02.720 --> 3:33:08.480]  to email this is mafia organized crime election meddling but finally
[3:33:08.480 --> 3:33:12.400]  when they blocked the hunter biden and the barisma information
[3:33:12.400 --> 3:33:16.240]  and the chinese information and the photos and the crack pipes and all the rest
[3:33:16.240 --> 3:33:19.760]  of it has been confirmed to be real biden hasn't denied it
[3:33:19.760 --> 3:33:22.880]  finally congress got pissed and said this is out of control
[3:33:22.880 --> 3:33:26.160]  you've got to stop it now we're taking action oh and check towards you went oh
[3:33:26.160 --> 3:33:29.360]  it's a mistake it's an accident it's an accident but they keep pushing and
[3:33:29.360 --> 3:33:33.680]  pushing because no one ever calls their bluff well info wars is calling their
[3:33:33.680 --> 3:33:38.560]  bluff and i want to thank you all for keeping us on the year
[3:33:38.560 --> 3:33:41.840]  covid rollout has been extremely well planned
[3:33:41.840 --> 3:33:45.200]  very well thought out and has been incrementally orchestrated
[3:33:45.200 --> 3:33:48.960]  first it's 15 days to keep the hospitals empty that's all i then it's
[3:33:48.960 --> 3:33:52.880]  two months and it's six months then it's a year now bill gates has 10 years
[3:33:52.880 --> 3:33:56.400]  and people are not saying i like my mask i like my face diaper
[3:33:56.400 --> 3:34:01.280]  i like make binky and so getting into the fear getting into the hysteria
[3:34:01.280 --> 3:34:05.040]  getting into all the exaggerated death numbers
[3:34:05.040 --> 3:34:09.040]  this is our new neurotic control freak society
[3:34:09.040 --> 3:34:16.080]  overseen by robots overseen by ai and all of it is designed to make humans
[3:34:16.080 --> 3:34:19.680]  non-essential that's why out of the gates they tell us
[3:34:19.680 --> 3:34:23.680]  you are non-essential you are non-essential
[3:34:23.680 --> 3:34:29.280]  your company your restaurant your job your profession is not essential
[3:34:29.280 --> 3:34:34.480]  this is so incredibly authoritarian premeditated and bill gates sits on top
[3:34:34.480 --> 3:34:38.400]  of it come on folks let's reject this
[3:34:38.400 --> 3:34:53.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:34:54.080 --> 3:34:58.720]  broadcasting internationally from the summit dot news headquarters
[3:34:58.720 --> 3:35:05.120]  in the united kingdom it's paul joseph watson
[3:35:05.120 --> 3:35:09.120]  going on to the latest project varitas revelations from james and kief of course
[3:35:09.120 --> 3:35:12.720]  we have the media hysterically claiming that all the
[3:35:12.720 --> 3:35:16.080]  videos are edited the videos are edited you can't take them seriously
[3:35:16.080 --> 3:35:21.280]  and yet one edited out of context video of rudy juliani in a hotel room is now
[3:35:21.280 --> 3:35:25.520]  the biggest story in america that's fine that's fine but james and kief
[3:35:25.520 --> 3:35:28.080]  videos they're all edited you can't trust them
[3:35:28.080 --> 3:35:31.760]  first though we're going to go to this video headline
[3:35:31.760 --> 3:35:36.080]  jewish restaurant in new york city hit with corona virus fine
[3:35:36.080 --> 3:35:41.600]  for leaving door open he was visited by a sacred anointed
[3:35:41.600 --> 3:35:45.760]  covid inspector for the crime the egregious crime
[3:35:45.760 --> 3:35:50.080]  of leaving his restaurant door open with nobody seated inside because you
[3:35:50.080 --> 3:35:54.320]  can't do that in many areas of new york that's bad that's evil
[3:35:54.320 --> 3:35:58.960]  and he was hit with a fine and a summons and he recorded the interaction
[3:35:58.960 --> 3:36:04.400]  with the sacred anointed covid inspector and here is the video
[3:36:04.400 --> 3:36:07.840]  ticket because my doors are open i want to understand

[3:36:22.560 --> 3:36:27.120]  everything is okay giving me a ticket because my doors are open
[3:36:27.120 --> 3:36:31.680]  what if my store is hot i'm not allowed to open the door because the store is hot
[3:36:31.680 --> 3:36:35.680]  everything is spelled out in the summons i'm going to give you a coffee
[3:36:35.680 --> 3:36:39.360]  and i'm gonna leave can i have your name please
[3:36:39.360 --> 3:36:43.440]  is it under report these rules but it's not fair that only because my doors are
[3:36:43.440 --> 3:36:47.920]  open and i'm getting a violation you know i'm struggling here every single
[3:36:47.920 --> 3:36:51.200]  day it's hard for me and there was nobody inside the
[3:36:51.200 --> 3:36:55.360]  store obviously because we don't have dining we only have takeout
[3:36:55.360 --> 3:36:59.120]  there was nobody in the store and i'm only getting a ticket because my doors
[3:36:59.120 --> 3:37:02.080]  are open uh can you just please repeat that sentence
[3:37:02.080 --> 3:37:04.480]  while i'm getting a violation is because i was
[3:37:04.480 --> 3:37:08.960]  amper i'm operating in a red zone with what what is that
[3:37:08.960 --> 3:37:12.960]  in the red zone uh you're only supposed to do pick up and deliver at the door
[3:37:12.960 --> 3:37:16.240]  everything is spelled out here in the summons but i'm doing pick up and
[3:37:16.240 --> 3:37:19.200]  delivery when the guy walked in i told him to start outside that was not
[3:37:19.200 --> 3:37:27.280]  good enough
[3:37:27.280 --> 3:37:30.720]  so they have the confrontation with the sacred anointed covid inspector of
[3:37:30.720 --> 3:37:34.960]  course he was in a quote red zone they opened up
[3:37:34.960 --> 3:37:38.720]  most of the restaurants in new york on september 30 but said they could only
[3:37:38.720 --> 3:37:42.320]  have 25 capacity which is nowhere
[3:37:42.320 --> 3:37:44.880]  near enough they're all going out of business
[3:37:44.880 --> 3:37:47.920]  the high streets crumbling people are going to be unemployed
[3:37:47.920 --> 3:37:50.880]  that's going to lead to poverty that's eventually going to lead
[3:37:50.880 --> 3:37:54.480]  to death it's not a matter of health versus
[3:37:54.480 --> 3:37:58.560]  the economy the economy is health
[3:37:58.560 --> 3:38:01.600]  so some of these restaurants have been able to open indoors they've got these
[3:38:01.600 --> 3:38:05.200]  weird bubbles which i posted on twitter yesterday
[3:38:05.200 --> 3:38:10.560]  of these trendy hipsters lapping as homeless people by the looks of it by
[3:38:10.560 --> 3:38:14.480]  dining outside in bubbles but even in areas where indoor
[3:38:14.480 --> 3:38:18.000]  dining is allowed capacity is restricted to 25 percent
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:21.920]  and tables must be separated by a minimum of six feet in all directions
[3:38:21.920 --> 3:38:26.080]  a recent report by the new york city hospitality alliance founder out of
[3:38:26.080 --> 3:38:32.320]  450 city restaurants in new york around 87 percent
[3:38:32.320 --> 3:38:37.520]  failed to make full rental payments for august and 34 percent were unable to pay
[3:38:37.520 --> 3:38:41.760]  at all they're all going out of business the vast majority of them
[3:38:41.760 --> 3:38:45.520]  are never coming back because of this virus
[3:38:45.520 --> 3:38:49.040]  and because of the mainstream media hysteria that the ram down people's
[3:38:49.040 --> 3:38:52.800]  throats to the point where they will literally jump out of the way if you
[3:38:52.800 --> 3:38:57.440]  walk near them in public meanwhile
[3:38:57.440 --> 3:39:01.760]  arty reports people will have to live with corona virus forever more says
[3:39:01.760 --> 3:39:05.600]  uk expert on governments advisory committee
[3:39:05.600 --> 3:39:08.480]  john edmunds a british epidemiologist on the government's
[3:39:08.480 --> 3:39:12.480]  coveted 19 advisory committee which has been proven wrong time and time again
[3:39:12.480 --> 3:39:15.040]  in every single model it publishes by the way
[3:39:15.040 --> 3:39:19.760]  but we continue to trust them warned uk lawmakers that there is very little
[3:39:19.760 --> 3:39:21.680]  chance of the corona virus being eliminated
[3:39:21.680 --> 3:39:25.120]  eliminated he said vaccines could slow its spread
[3:39:25.120 --> 3:39:28.560]  he's basically come out and said we need more lockdown
[3:39:28.560 --> 3:39:32.400]  and even if we have more lockdown the virus is now going away
[3:39:32.400 --> 3:39:36.800]  they've got this ridiculous policy it seems especially in countries like
[3:39:36.800 --> 3:39:40.640]  scotland where they actually think they can have
[3:39:40.640 --> 3:39:45.760]  achieve zero covid it's kind of like zero carbon emissions i.e.
[3:39:45.760 --> 3:39:51.680]  completely impossible unless at great devastating cost to the human race
[3:39:51.680 --> 3:39:55.200]  in terms of freedoms liberties the economy but that's apparently what
[3:39:55.200 --> 3:39:57.840]  they're going for and now he's saying it's going to last forever more
[3:39:57.840 --> 3:40:02.240]  you saw the article there we had from a us army official
[3:40:02.240 --> 3:40:05.600]  saying that the social distancing measures this covid restriction
[3:40:05.600 --> 3:40:10.480]  dystopian hell is going to last forever you had cnn's chief security
[3:40:10.480 --> 3:40:14.560]  correspondent come out a few weeks ago and say that the mask
[3:40:14.560 --> 3:40:17.680]  wearing is permanent all of this is permanent
[3:40:17.680 --> 3:40:21.760]  we were told we needed to just give up a little bit of our freedoms for a short
[3:40:21.760 --> 3:40:24.000]  amount of time and we'd all get back to normal
[3:40:24.000 --> 3:40:27.840]  no this is the new normal and it's forever
[3:40:27.840 --> 3:40:32.800]  but there is some pushback there is some real resistance building
[3:40:32.800 --> 3:40:35.680]  and that's starting to be evident in the polls
[3:40:35.680 --> 3:40:40.800]  where especially in the united kingdom still a majority of people will support
[3:40:40.800 --> 3:40:43.680]  lockdowns when they're asked by these pollsters
[3:40:43.680 --> 3:40:47.760]  but when they're actually being honest as to whether they comply with the law
[3:40:47.760 --> 3:40:50.240]  i think one of the recent polls showed that only
[3:40:50.240 --> 3:40:56.000]  18 percent of the british population were complying with lockdown laws
[3:40:56.000 --> 3:40:58.880]  and that makes sense because the government came out literally a couple of
[3:40:58.880 --> 3:41:01.840]  days ago and said that you can't have sex with your partner
[3:41:01.840 --> 3:41:06.720]  so there this whole thing about oh stop controlling my body i'm progressive
[3:41:06.720 --> 3:41:10.480]  and yet you support a law where the government says
[3:41:10.480 --> 3:41:14.880]  you can't have sex with your wife or girlfriend if you don't live with her
[3:41:14.880 --> 3:41:18.080]  and yet they support it the same people who support
[3:41:18.080 --> 3:41:21.920]  my body my choice in the context of abortion
[3:41:21.920 --> 3:41:25.520]  we've got another clip now though this is the based
[3:41:25.520 --> 3:41:30.400]  british grandma from yorkshire where i hail from originally
[3:41:30.400 --> 3:41:34.240]  being featured shockingly on bbc news and this i think she's
[3:41:34.240 --> 3:41:38.320]  84 years old and even she's up there saying
[3:41:38.320 --> 3:41:42.320]  don't sacrifice the future of the country don't sacrifice
[3:41:42.320 --> 3:41:45.520]  many more deaths in terms of what lockdown will cause
[3:41:45.520 --> 3:41:49.520]  simply to shield vulnerable older people and they're not even following that
[3:41:49.520 --> 3:41:52.880]  policy anyway but she's saying to her credit
[3:41:52.880 --> 3:41:56.960]  i'm 84 years old i think she's 84 around the age i want to live the rest of my
[3:41:56.960 --> 3:42:01.360]  life in freedom not under house arrest here's
[3:42:01.360 --> 3:42:06.400]  the short clip let's roll it i think it's all ridiculous
[3:42:06.400 --> 3:42:09.680]  we should never have been in lockdown all the people who are vulnerable should
[3:42:09.680 --> 3:42:15.440]  have been helped and kept on saying and all the rest of us i'm 83
[3:42:15.440 --> 3:42:20.000]  i don't give a sorry i look at it this way i've not got all that many years
[3:42:20.000 --> 3:42:23.200]  left and i'm not going to be fastened in a house
[3:42:23.200 --> 3:42:27.440]  when the government has got it all wrong we need how can we get
[3:42:27.440 --> 3:42:31.440]  the country on its feet money wise where's all the money
[3:42:31.440 --> 3:42:34.640]  by the end of this year there's going to be millions of people unemployed he
[3:42:34.640 --> 3:42:37.680]  knows when to pay for it all the young ones not me
[3:42:37.680 --> 3:42:43.840]  because i'm going to be dead based yorkshire granny with some common sense
[3:42:43.840 --> 3:42:47.680]  red pills right there i'm sure that they even allowed that on the bbc
[3:42:47.680 --> 3:42:51.520]  but there you go there seems public opinion is finally
[3:42:51.520 --> 3:42:56.400]  probably four or five months too late starting to shift will it be in time
[3:42:56.400 --> 3:43:00.800]  will it lead to any actual changes that remains to be seen
[3:43:00.800 --> 3:43:03.600]  meanwhile in the u.s presidential election
[3:43:03.600 --> 3:43:07.200]  headline pollster hidden voters not reflected in polls will
[3:43:07.200 --> 3:43:11.520]  secure trump reelection this is coming out of trafalgar group which is
[3:43:11.520 --> 3:43:14.720]  interesting because they were only one of two polling firms
[3:43:14.720 --> 3:43:18.560]  that correctly predicted donald trump's 2016 victory
[3:43:18.560 --> 3:43:22.480]  and they say that he's on course for reelection due to hidden voters
[3:43:22.480 --> 3:43:25.840]  who are not reflected in mainstream polling because they are reluctant
[3:43:25.840 --> 3:43:30.480]  to admit their support for trump so obviously this impact
[3:43:30.480 --> 3:43:35.760]  this effect of quote shy trump voters common sense dictates has probably
[3:43:35.760 --> 3:43:38.640]  escalated after months and months of blm
[3:43:38.640 --> 3:43:43.920]  and t for riots where people are reluctant maybe you could say afraid
[3:43:43.920 --> 3:43:48.080]  of actually telling pollsters their voting preference for trump
[3:43:48.080 --> 3:43:52.560]  because they're afraid of retribution they're not sure that the poll is truly
[3:43:52.560 --> 3:43:55.280]  anonymous they're not sure that their information is
[3:43:55.280 --> 3:43:59.760]  not going to be doxxed by journalists and another scandal
[3:43:59.760 --> 3:44:03.840]  to that effect came out today that journalists were digging through
[3:44:03.840 --> 3:44:07.440]  polling data and finding out who was going to vote for trump
[3:44:07.440 --> 3:44:10.720]  and then trying to reveal their identities to have them targeted
[3:44:10.720 --> 3:44:14.400]  because journalists are just such good people so progressive and friendly and
[3:44:14.400 --> 3:44:18.320]  nice so this head of the polling group
[3:44:18.320 --> 3:44:21.920]  trafalgar group basically said there's clear feeling among conservatives and
[3:44:21.920 --> 3:44:25.520]  people that are for the president that they're not interested in sharing
[3:44:25.520 --> 3:44:29.920]  their opinions so readily on the telephone we've seen people being beat up
[3:44:29.920 --> 3:44:33.120]  harassed docks have their houses torn up because they express
[3:44:33.120 --> 3:44:36.400]  political opinions that are not in line with the politically
[3:44:36.400 --> 3:44:40.560]  correct establishment now how large this pool of
[3:44:40.560 --> 3:44:46.000]  shy trump voters is remains to be seen but there was another interesting poll
[3:44:46.000 --> 3:44:50.880]  which was put out by fox news and featured by florida daily
[3:44:50.880 --> 3:44:54.560]  and it found that most americans think their neighbors
[3:44:54.560 --> 3:44:58.480]  are quietly voting for trump almost half of those surveyed
[3:44:58.480 --> 3:45:02.800]  49 percent think their neighbors are supporting trump compared to the 38
[3:45:02.800 --> 3:45:05.920]  percent who believe their neighbors are backing biden
[3:45:05.920 --> 3:45:09.360]  so again that doesn't line up with the national polls which are all of course
[3:45:09.360 --> 3:45:13.600]  proven wrong back in 2016 so there could be this hidden
[3:45:13.600 --> 3:45:17.200]  by no means massive but significant quotient
[3:45:17.200 --> 3:45:20.720]  of shy trump voters who aren't reflected in the polls but who are
[3:45:20.720 --> 3:45:24.080]  going to vote for trump and that could be big that's going to wrap it up warring
[3:45:24.080 --> 3:45:40.320]  coming up next summit don't use keep it right here
