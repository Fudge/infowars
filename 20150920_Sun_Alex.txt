[00:00.000 --> 00:15.320]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:15.320 --> 00:21.960]  Rallying Patriots worldwide.
[00:21.960 --> 00:29.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29.320 --> 00:34.320]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, September 20th, 2015.
[00:34.320 --> 00:36.080]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:36.080 --> 00:39.600]  We are overwhelmed with your support today.
[00:39.600 --> 00:44.960]  We have an article that's up on infowars.com, anti-globalist network launches worldwide.
[00:44.960 --> 00:46.800]  That's thanks to your support.
[00:46.800 --> 00:52.680]  We had our money bomb this week and I guess it was about midday yesterday.
[00:52.680 --> 00:54.400]  We hit the million dollar mark.
[00:54.400 --> 00:56.640]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:56.640 --> 01:02.400]  To thank you, we have extended the free shipping and the specials till tonight at midnight.
[01:02.400 --> 01:05.200]  But thank you so much for helping to support this operation.
[01:05.200 --> 01:09.640]  Of course, it's a leap of faith to expand any time you have a business.
[01:09.640 --> 01:12.240]  This is a major financial commitment.
[01:12.240 --> 01:18.120]  It requires an investment in new equipment as well as massive operating expenses.
[01:18.120 --> 01:23.280]  Each month we needed your help to get to that level so that we could, the next part of this
[01:23.280 --> 01:28.680]  game, of course, is getting stations to sign up on this free-to-air process and the instructions
[01:28.680 --> 01:30.400]  on how to do that, where you can help us.
[01:30.400 --> 01:32.680]  It doesn't require any money.
[01:32.680 --> 01:36.480]  It just requires some of your time to help us get these stations on board.
[01:36.480 --> 01:38.480]  Of course, it's going to be offered free-to-air.
[01:38.480 --> 01:39.760]  We'll have some of our commercials.
[01:39.760 --> 01:41.600]  They'll put some of their commercials on.
[01:41.600 --> 01:45.800]  But they need to know that there's interest, that there's an audience there in order for
[01:45.800 --> 01:47.280]  this to get started.
[01:47.280 --> 01:52.600]  We have no doubt in our minds, and I don't believe that you do either as a listener,
[01:52.600 --> 01:55.880]  but we can do well once we get on these stations.
[01:55.880 --> 02:02.440]  We know from past experience when Alex went to Orlando, he immediately shot to the number
[02:02.440 --> 02:06.960]  one position, leapfrogging Rush Limbaugh in that market.
[02:06.960 --> 02:12.520]  That happened for a few months, and it scared the system so much that that station was sold.
[02:12.520 --> 02:15.840]  That's happened a number of times as Alex joked.
[02:15.840 --> 02:21.080]  If you want to sell your station for a huge profit, just put him on there against Rush
[02:21.080 --> 02:25.360]  Limbaugh, and the system will buy you out and convert it to another format.
[02:25.360 --> 02:26.760]  We saw that happen a number of times.
[02:26.760 --> 02:32.360]  We know we can compete in this free market of ideas.
[02:32.360 --> 02:36.920]  We are telling something that is very different in our analysis than you're hearing in the
[02:36.920 --> 02:37.920]  mainstream.
[02:37.920 --> 02:40.120]  Many of them you're hearing in conservative talk radio.
[02:40.120 --> 02:44.760]  It's a very different understanding, different issues that we're taking a look at.
[02:44.760 --> 02:46.760]  Here's some of those issues that we're going to be talking about today.
[02:46.760 --> 02:48.880]  Of course, we're going to look at the top candidates.
[02:48.880 --> 02:52.760]  There's been a lot of developments in the last couple of days on the GOP side.
[02:52.760 --> 02:59.320]  We've had the back and forth with Donald Trump not defending Obama when somebody made a statement
[02:59.320 --> 03:02.800]  about him and the press getting all bent out of shape about it.
[03:02.800 --> 03:07.280]  He rightly said, it's not my responsibility to defend Obama, and of course, if somebody
[03:07.280 --> 03:12.040]  said something negative about me, about Donald Trump, he said, I'm sure that Obama would
[03:12.040 --> 03:14.800]  not feel that it was his responsibility to defend me.
[03:14.800 --> 03:15.800]  Absolutely right.
[03:15.800 --> 03:19.640]  And then Trump went a bit further, as he always does.
[03:19.640 --> 03:25.200]  He's not just going to go on the defense, he always goes on the offense, and he says,
[03:25.200 --> 03:28.440]  what you really need to be talking about is the war on Christians, and we're going to
[03:28.440 --> 03:29.440]  talk about that.
[03:29.440 --> 03:31.400]  He's absolutely right about that.
[03:31.400 --> 03:34.480]  We've talked about that many times for a very long time here on Info Wars.
[03:34.480 --> 03:37.840]  We're going to tell you what we've said in the past, what is going on.
[03:37.840 --> 03:41.880]  We're going to tell you that, yes, there is a war on Christians worldwide.
[03:41.880 --> 03:45.520]  There's a war on Christians coming out of Washington, D.C. as well.
[03:45.520 --> 03:48.480]  And this should concern you even if you're not a Christian.
[03:48.480 --> 03:54.960]  It should concern you because of the way that it's being done, because it's another example
[03:54.960 --> 04:01.320]  of how the rule of law is being shunned in favor of dictatorship, essentially.
[04:01.320 --> 04:06.240]  The dictatorship of a president, the dictatorship of a bureaucracy, the dictatorship of political
[04:06.240 --> 04:07.240]  correctness.
[04:07.240 --> 04:11.440]  That's why it should concern you, because it's going to be pervasive in a number of
[04:11.440 --> 04:12.800]  other areas.
[04:12.800 --> 04:16.400]  Now this war of religions, and of course, this is a minefield, and we're not going
[04:16.400 --> 04:17.400]  to tiptoe through it.
[04:17.400 --> 04:22.640]  We're going to go running through it today, so I'm sure that some people are going to
[04:22.640 --> 04:26.840]  get upset about what we have to say, but I'm going to try to explain to you why this is
[04:26.840 --> 04:33.040]  a broader issue, not something that is just a war of religions.
[04:33.040 --> 04:38.240]  Earlier today, on Meet the Press, they talked to Ben Carson along these same lines, and
[04:38.240 --> 04:39.800]  he made a very controversial statement.
[04:39.800 --> 04:43.040]  He said he didn't believe that a Muslim should be president.
[04:43.040 --> 04:47.480]  We're going to talk about that when we come back, as well as many other topics.
[04:47.480 --> 04:48.480]  Stay with us.
[04:48.480 --> 04:52.640]  We'll be right back, and we'll have Alex Jones joining us briefly at the top of this
[04:52.640 --> 04:53.640]  hour.
[04:53.640 --> 04:58.640]  We'll be right back.
[04:58.640 --> 05:04.000]  Breaking now at Infowars.com, Top Imam, Muslim migrants should breed with Europeans to conquer
[05:04.000 --> 05:05.000]  their countries.
[05:05.000 --> 05:08.640]  Sheikh Mohammed A'id recently gave a speech in which he asserted that Muslims should
[05:08.640 --> 05:12.840]  use the migrant crisis to breed with European citizens to conquer their countries.
[05:12.840 --> 05:16.400]  A'id stated that European countries were not rolling out the red carpet for migrants
[05:16.400 --> 05:20.200]  because they were compassionate, but because Europe was in dire need of a new source of
[05:20.200 --> 05:21.200]  labor.
[05:21.200 --> 05:23.320]  Soon, we will trample them underfoot, Allah willing, he said.
[05:23.320 --> 05:27.920]  The Imam's statements directly echo a philosophy born in the early 20th century called the
[05:27.920 --> 05:32.840]  Kalerji Plan, devised by an Austrian diplomat named Richard Kodenhof Kalerji.
[05:32.840 --> 05:35.600]  He writes, the band of the future will be of mixed race.
[05:35.600 --> 05:40.240]  Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time and
[05:40.240 --> 05:41.240]  prejudice.
[05:41.240 --> 05:45.040]  The Eurasian-Negroid race of the future, similar in appearance to that of ancient Egyptians,
[05:45.040 --> 05:48.680]  will replace the diversity of peoples with the diversity of individuals.
[05:48.680 --> 05:51.800]  Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com and PrismPlanet.tv.
[05:51.800 --> 05:55.240]  We're holding the Operation Money Bomb specials over until the end of the weekend, so log
[05:55.240 --> 05:59.920]  on now to Infowars.com forward slash money bomb.
[05:59.920 --> 06:04.720]  Alex Jones here with my co-host, David Knight, thanking all the Infowars, who in the last
[06:04.720 --> 06:11.720]  few days made history by donating to the 2015 Operation Money Bomb War Chest.
[06:11.720 --> 06:18.320]  We have raised close to a million dollars that is absolutely essential to beam via satellite
[06:18.320 --> 06:24.360]  to thousands of UHF, VHF and cable stations around North America and all the way down
[06:24.360 --> 06:25.840]  into Central America.
[06:25.840 --> 06:30.920]  The world is hungry for the message of liberty and one of the favorite refrains of our founding
[06:30.920 --> 06:37.080]  fathers was that all the evil men and piracy to flourish is the good men and women do nothing.
[06:37.080 --> 06:41.480]  So we're not claiming that we're going to save the world by doing this, but together
[06:41.480 --> 06:48.640]  taking action in little ways, small ways, big ways, huge ways, we are going to change
[06:48.640 --> 06:50.080]  the course of history.
[06:50.080 --> 06:53.320]  What the globalists are doing is incredibly unpopular.
[06:53.320 --> 06:58.400]  It's illegal, it's tyrannical, whether it's harvesting baby parts worldwide and China
[06:58.400 --> 07:03.840]  selling organs, whether it's the forced inoculation agenda planetary wide, whether it's funding
[07:03.840 --> 07:07.320]  radical Islamic groups to destabilize areas of the world.
[07:07.320 --> 07:10.560]  It's all criminal and it's all run by the same people.
[07:10.560 --> 07:15.200]  So because we've done the research, because we know who the enemy is, it's our responsibility
[07:15.200 --> 07:19.160]  to not just sit here and reach 20, 30 million people a week.
[07:19.160 --> 07:24.840]  So we're launching the first phase of a program to eventually have satellites covering free
[07:24.840 --> 07:28.880]  to air the entire populated world.
[07:28.880 --> 07:33.440]  And we've built the team now with David Knight and the other reporters and anchors and the
[07:33.440 --> 07:38.200]  journalist and the investigative researchers and the writers to really give the globalists
[07:38.200 --> 07:39.200]  around for their money.
[07:39.200 --> 07:44.280]  We're about to update infowars.com and prismplanet.com with new, more modern designs.
[07:44.280 --> 07:48.120]  We're about to launch a lot of new things here, but I just wanted to thank all of you
[07:48.120 --> 07:52.840]  who did donate, who bought the products in the last two days because you've raised almost
[07:52.840 --> 07:57.960]  a million dollars, but it's been three years since we've had a fundraiser.
[07:57.960 --> 08:00.920]  And I want to actually reach our goal of a million dollars.
[08:00.920 --> 08:04.720]  We need to do it to be able to get a couple more reporters, some of the more expensive
[08:04.720 --> 08:05.720]  equipment we need.
[08:05.720 --> 08:06.720]  We've paid for the satellite.
[08:06.720 --> 08:08.200]  We've paid for the close captioning.
[08:08.200 --> 08:11.720]  We've paid for a lot of the groundwork to get this going.
[08:11.720 --> 08:15.840]  We're already up on the satellite, affiliates are already tuning in, already signing on
[08:15.840 --> 08:16.840]  right now.
[08:16.840 --> 08:19.240]  So thank God and thank all of you.
[08:19.240 --> 08:24.080]  But now we need to go to that next level to ensure that over the next 12 months we're
[08:24.080 --> 08:25.800]  able to complete this operation.
[08:25.800 --> 08:31.280]  And my plan is to then make it self-sufficient and we'll never have another fundraiser again.
[08:31.280 --> 08:32.600]  We may.
[08:32.600 --> 08:34.840]  It was three years since I had another one.
[08:34.840 --> 08:40.440]  We want to, again, not be under the control of sponsors, not be under the control of
[08:40.440 --> 08:42.200]  outside advertisers.
[08:42.200 --> 08:46.880]  We want to be independent selling high quality products that you believe in, that you use,
[08:46.880 --> 08:48.000]  that you like.
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.920]  Not occasionally, we do come to you to ask us to help bring this operation to the next
[08:51.920 --> 08:52.920]  level.
[08:52.920 --> 08:55.880]  But you've got to feel really good right now knowing that you've done that.
[08:55.880 --> 08:58.000]  And we've pretty much reached our goals.
[08:58.000 --> 09:05.600]  But in the interest of that, we want to extend the sales, massive sales of upwards of 20%
[09:05.600 --> 09:10.640]  off, free shipping, you name it, on hundreds of items at infowarsstore.com.
[09:10.640 --> 09:14.520]  You can also call 888-253-3139.
[09:14.520 --> 09:20.600]  We're going to run that through Friday, Saturday into Sunday at 6 o'clock Central Standard
[09:20.600 --> 09:21.600]  Time.
[09:21.600 --> 09:24.120]  David's going to be hosting the Sunday show this weekend.
[09:24.120 --> 09:28.880]  And when it ends, we will have to turn off those specials because we're contractually
[09:28.880 --> 09:34.320]  through some of these suppliers unable to continue to offer some of these products at
[09:34.320 --> 09:39.480]  the prices we're offering because it hurts the competition a little too much.
[09:39.480 --> 09:41.120]  So again, I want to thank you all.
[09:41.120 --> 09:46.280]  I want to invite you to double down on this revolution against tyranny, or if you haven't
[09:46.280 --> 09:50.560]  donated or if you haven't checked out the great products at infowarsstore.com, I want
[09:50.560 --> 09:51.560]  to invite you to check it out.
[09:51.560 --> 09:54.160]  David Knight, you've been here three years.
[09:54.160 --> 09:55.280]  We don't use teleprompters.
[09:55.280 --> 09:56.280]  We don't script this.
[09:56.280 --> 09:59.720]  I just called you in here five minutes ago and said, I want to thank everybody.
[09:59.720 --> 10:02.920]  I want to encourage them to be part of this.
[10:02.920 --> 10:04.920]  This is historic what we're doing.
[10:04.920 --> 10:08.280]  And I wanted you, I'm telling you now, to speak to what it's been like for you being
[10:08.280 --> 10:13.680]  here three years and where you see the info war going from this point because you didn't
[10:13.680 --> 10:15.800]  win a contest five years ago, you entered.
[10:15.800 --> 10:17.960]  But out of that, we offered to hire you.
[10:17.960 --> 10:20.960]  You move your family down here from the Carolinas.
[10:20.960 --> 10:25.280]  And I want you to share your experience teleprompter-free, unscripted of what it's been like and have
[10:25.280 --> 10:26.280]  a message for folks.
[10:26.280 --> 10:31.040]  But most importantly, I wanted to thank you as representative of the listeners who don't
[10:31.040 --> 10:34.240]  just stand, as I've said, recidus, but at the heart of what we're doing.
[10:34.240 --> 10:38.000]  David Knight was a listener and a family man and a business owner and engineer.
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.080]  And he pulled up stakes and came down here.
[10:40.080 --> 10:43.160]  And now he's hosting the show, now he's reaching tens of millions.
[10:43.160 --> 10:49.080]  And so he's a microcosm of what supporting ideas does, evils only winning because good
[10:49.080 --> 10:51.320]  men and women haven't got off the bench in the fight.
[10:51.320 --> 10:55.560]  So David, I want you to close this out, spend a few minutes, but I love you and your family
[10:55.560 --> 10:56.560]  and I appreciate you.
[10:56.560 --> 10:57.560]  Thank you.
[10:57.560 --> 10:58.560]  Thank you.
[10:58.560 --> 10:59.560]  It's amazing to work with such great people.
[10:59.560 --> 11:00.560]  Thank you so much.
[11:00.560 --> 11:05.440]  And I can tell you that what I've seen here in this amount of time is how Alex is pouring
[11:05.440 --> 11:08.800]  this back into expanding the information outreach.
[11:08.800 --> 11:13.000]  We're not setting on a hoard of gold like some kind of a dragon.
[11:13.000 --> 11:14.320]  He is investing this.
[11:14.320 --> 11:19.000]  I've seen massive changes, not only expansion in the number of personnel, but also expansion
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.280]  in the studios that we put there, which is essential for us to be able to reach out to
[11:22.280 --> 11:25.040]  people, to have something that looks professional.
[11:25.040 --> 11:27.000]  People won't tune in and listen to you.
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.240]  If you're trying to reach somebody that's never heard this message before, you've got
[11:30.240 --> 11:34.720]  a lot of obstacles in front of you because they've never heard this kind of information
[11:34.720 --> 11:35.720]  before.
[11:35.720 --> 11:40.160]  They're getting a very different story from the planned information that's coming out
[11:40.160 --> 11:41.640]  of the mainstream media.
[11:41.640 --> 11:44.800]  And so when we hit them with very different information, if we look extremely different,
[11:44.800 --> 11:46.560]  that's very difficult for us to reach them.
[11:46.560 --> 11:49.280]  So we have to have a certain way to present it.
[11:49.280 --> 11:52.600]  We have to have certain ways that we can reach out to people.
[11:52.600 --> 11:56.640]  That's what I've seen Alex doing is investing in this all out.
[11:56.640 --> 12:01.240]  As I said before, when we saw what happened with Sandy Hook, we knew what was going to
[12:01.240 --> 12:02.480]  be done with this.
[12:02.480 --> 12:05.080]  We knew this was a massive push to take away the Second Amendment.
[12:05.080 --> 12:07.840]  We know how important all of our rights are.
[12:07.840 --> 12:11.800]  But we know that the Second Amendment is guaranteeing these other rights as well.
[12:11.800 --> 12:15.320]  And I remember how it was like this money bomb effort.
[12:15.320 --> 12:19.960]  For a couple of weeks at the very beginning, it was just around the clock pushing back
[12:19.960 --> 12:20.960]  against this.
[12:20.960 --> 12:21.960]  What can we do?
[12:21.960 --> 12:23.640]  How can we expose where they're going with this?
[12:23.640 --> 12:25.040]  What they're doing with this?
[12:25.040 --> 12:27.600]  So we've seen this happen over and over again.
[12:27.600 --> 12:28.600]  It's going to happen again.
[12:28.600 --> 12:33.200]  There's been multiple times since I've been here that we have made a difference.
[12:33.200 --> 12:37.960]  You passing our information along, you being a subscriber to the nightly news when we were
[12:37.960 --> 12:41.880]  fighting against these expansions in the war on Syria, when they had the false flag attacks
[12:41.880 --> 12:45.440]  with the sarin gas, we explained that to people.
[12:45.440 --> 12:49.400]  We were leading the fight and explaining to people what was really going on there.
[12:49.400 --> 12:54.080]  Now it's breaking that our government has been working with Chechen rebels, bringing
[12:54.080 --> 12:58.760]  them and training them and injecting them into Syria, going back to 2012.
[12:58.760 --> 13:01.120]  Mainstream media is reporting that now.
[13:01.120 --> 13:05.600]  Reporting the fact that we have American troops on the ground in Syria a day after everybody
[13:05.600 --> 13:09.720]  was saying it's so dangerous and provocative that Putin is saying he's going to put Russian
[13:09.720 --> 13:10.720]  troops there.
[13:10.720 --> 13:16.760]  So it's very important it has real world consequences for all of us to understand what is behind
[13:16.760 --> 13:18.280]  this, what is happening.
[13:18.280 --> 13:22.800]  That's why it is imperative for all of us to understand what's going on and to warn
[13:22.800 --> 13:24.680]  our neighbors what's going on.
[13:24.680 --> 13:28.800]  There's been so many issues on which Info Wars has been a real game changer, but we've
[13:28.800 --> 13:31.760]  made a real difference with you, with your support.
[13:31.760 --> 13:35.720]  That's why it's vital for you to join with us and support us now.
[13:35.720 --> 13:37.440]  Thank you so much for standing with us.
[13:37.440 --> 13:38.960]  Thank you so much for your support.
[13:38.960 --> 13:42.360]  Let's get that last bit of effort to finish this off.
[13:42.360 --> 13:48.200]  For Info Wars Nightly News and for the Alex Jones radio show, I'm David Knight.
[13:48.200 --> 13:51.540]  And again, thank you so much for your help sometime yesterday.
[13:51.540 --> 13:54.680]  We reached the goal of $1 million.
[13:54.680 --> 13:58.680]  Thank you so much for that, and as a thank you, Alex has extended free shipping on anything
[13:58.680 --> 14:01.840]  you want to get at the store until midnight tonight.
[14:01.840 --> 14:06.480]  It is very, very important that you've stood with us and we cannot thank you enough.
[14:06.480 --> 14:08.520]  Your support is absolutely overwhelming.
[14:08.520 --> 14:10.520]  Now help us get on these stations.
[14:10.520 --> 14:13.200]  You can find that information there at the Money Bomb.
[14:13.200 --> 14:17.800]  There's a PDF to download, to let you know if you have a satellite system where you can
[14:17.800 --> 14:23.120]  listen to this directly, how you can do that, but also how you can approach stations and
[14:23.120 --> 14:26.000]  let them know there's an interest in your area.
[14:26.000 --> 14:27.200]  That is vital.
[14:27.200 --> 14:31.880]  We're confident that if we get on the stations in those areas that we will do very well.
[14:31.880 --> 14:35.520]  We've seen this happen in the past, and we know that it will happen as well.
[14:35.520 --> 14:40.400]  As I mentioned in the last segment, just looking at the experience that Alex had with radio
[14:40.400 --> 14:46.080]  in Orlando, going head to head with Alex Jones on a station there immediately shot to number
[14:46.080 --> 14:50.760]  one and of course that station got sold right away after just a couple of months of that
[14:50.760 --> 14:51.760]  happening.
[14:51.760 --> 14:54.560]  They got sold and changed the format of that station.
[14:54.560 --> 15:00.160]  So Alex has joked if you want to make a profit on your station, just carry his radio program
[15:00.160 --> 15:05.360]  and you're likely to get sold and changed over to another format just to get him off,
[15:05.360 --> 15:10.360]  just to get him off of the competition because we have a message that the mainstream media,
[15:10.360 --> 15:13.320]  whether it's conservative or liberal, does not want you to hear.
[15:13.320 --> 15:16.960]  They have a very narrow controlled narrative that they want to feed you.
[15:16.960 --> 15:22.360]  A very controlled this or that narrative is either this one or that one.
[15:22.360 --> 15:27.600]  But there are so many issues and the bigger picture that they do not want you to see.
[15:27.600 --> 15:29.760]  Here's some of the news that we're going to be covering today.
[15:29.760 --> 15:33.520]  Of course, there's the back and forth between Trump versus Obama, the war on Christians.
[15:33.520 --> 15:38.400]  We're also going to be looking at the comments that Ben Carson made today earlier on Meet
[15:38.400 --> 15:41.920]  the Press about whether or not there should be a Muslim president.
[15:41.920 --> 15:46.360]  We've got the United States preparing for a new war against Russia.
[15:46.360 --> 15:47.360]  And guess what?
[15:47.360 --> 15:49.840]  The U.S. keeps losing in these war games.
[15:49.840 --> 15:50.840]  Really?
[15:50.840 --> 15:51.840]  Stay with us.
[15:51.840 --> 15:57.680]  We're going to be right back.
[15:57.680 --> 15:58.680]  Another major health threat.
[15:58.680 --> 16:03.040]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink
[16:03.040 --> 16:04.040]  the water.
[16:04.040 --> 16:06.440]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[16:06.440 --> 16:12.120]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[16:12.120 --> 16:13.440]  single day?
[16:13.440 --> 16:16.440]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[16:16.440 --> 16:19.360]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[16:19.360 --> 16:21.400]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[16:21.400 --> 16:24.320]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[16:24.320 --> 16:30.240]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[16:30.240 --> 16:33.440]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[16:33.440 --> 16:36.680]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[16:36.680 --> 16:42.640]  The Pro Pure Pro 1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must have for every modern independently
[16:42.640 --> 16:44.400]  minded household.

[17:51.680 --> 18:02.720]  It's now more clear than ever, the globalist have launched a planetary destabilization
[18:02.720 --> 18:03.720]  plan.
[18:03.720 --> 18:07.360]  Here at the Info Wars operation, we hope and pray that this is not the case.
[18:07.360 --> 18:11.360]  But the signs of things deteriorating around the world are unmistakable.
[18:11.360 --> 18:15.680]  For many years I've been working with my patriot supply and we have now developed a private
[18:15.680 --> 18:17.880]  label called Info Wars Select.
[18:17.880 --> 18:21.640]  Look, it's important to have firearms and water filtration during a collapse, but you've

[20:17.640 --> 20:31.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, September 20th, 2015.
[20:31.480 --> 20:33.320]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[20:33.320 --> 20:36.080]  We have a host of issues we're going to talk about today.
[20:36.080 --> 20:39.960]  Donald Trump released a new position paper on the Second Amendment.
[20:39.960 --> 20:41.520]  We're going to break that down for you.
[20:41.520 --> 20:47.920]  Earlier this morning, on Meet the Press, Ben Carson was asked if a Muslim could be President.
[20:47.920 --> 20:49.920]  We're going to talk about his comments on that.
[20:49.920 --> 20:54.360]  But before we get to those issues, I want to go over this back and forth that's been
[20:54.360 --> 20:59.560]  developing over the last several days between Trump and the press, and I would say also
[20:59.560 --> 21:00.560]  Obama.
[21:00.560 --> 21:04.480]  Of course, he took a lot of flak because a man stood up at one of the rallies and said,
[21:04.480 --> 21:08.040]  you know, Obama's a Muslim, he's not even American citizen, we've got these camps all
[21:08.040 --> 21:09.040]  over the place.
[21:09.040 --> 21:11.360]  What are you going to do about this?
[21:11.360 --> 21:18.120]  And the media was absolutely livid that he did not reprimand this individual for saying
[21:18.120 --> 21:25.400]  that Obama was a Muslim, not an American citizen, to which Trump responded, I'm not morally
[21:25.400 --> 21:28.320]  obligated to defend Obama from the birthers.
[21:28.320 --> 21:33.480]  He says if the rolls were reversed, Obama would not come to his defense.
[21:33.480 --> 21:34.480]  Absolutely right.
[21:34.480 --> 21:35.480]  Here's what he tweeted out.
[21:35.480 --> 21:38.360]  This is a story we have up on Infowars.com from The Hill.
[21:38.360 --> 21:42.480]  Donald Trump tweeted out, am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody
[21:42.480 --> 21:44.800]  says something bad or controversial about him?
[21:44.800 --> 21:45.800]  I don't think so.
[21:45.800 --> 21:46.800]  That's right.
[21:46.800 --> 21:47.800]  He certainly isn't.
[21:47.800 --> 21:49.080]  And then he went on to say this.
[21:49.080 --> 21:55.600]  He said, this is the first time in my life I've caused controversy by not saying something.
[21:55.600 --> 22:00.400]  And finally, he said, if someone made an ask your controversial statement about me to
[22:00.400 --> 22:04.080]  the president, do you really think he would come to my rescue?
[22:04.080 --> 22:05.840]  Not a chance.
[22:05.840 --> 22:10.160]  But then he went on to say something that did cause more controversy because he pointed
[22:10.160 --> 22:17.000]  out that the real issue was the war on Christians and the war on Christianity.
[22:17.000 --> 22:18.640]  And this is something that's going on globally.
[22:18.640 --> 22:22.400]  This is something we can see in America in terms of intolerance.
[22:22.400 --> 22:27.680]  And if you're not a Christian, if you're not a Muslim, this still should concern you because
[22:27.680 --> 22:30.880]  it concerns how we are going to treat different groups.
[22:30.880 --> 22:32.440]  It concerns the rule of law.
[22:32.440 --> 22:33.680]  It concerns due process.
[22:33.680 --> 22:38.160]  It concerns individual liberties and where they come in conflict.
[22:38.160 --> 22:43.560]  Is there a way that we can maintain each other's individual liberties without stomping on the
[22:43.560 --> 22:45.040]  other person's rights?
[22:45.040 --> 22:48.080]  And we haven't done that very well in this country so far.
[22:48.080 --> 22:52.360]  In most cases, the pendulum swings too far in one way and then swings too far back in
[22:52.360 --> 22:53.360]  the other way.
[22:53.360 --> 22:56.240]  Is it possible for us to find a balance?
[22:56.240 --> 23:01.360]  But when we look at the record of the Obama administration, I don't see a balance there.
[23:01.360 --> 23:06.040]  Now, of course, there's this article from Breitbart saying pro-Christian vow, Trump
[23:06.040 --> 23:09.280]  escalates against the media's Muslim Obama smear.
[23:09.280 --> 23:12.720]  Donald Trump, they say, is hitting back twice as hard as the Democrats.
[23:12.720 --> 23:18.080]  He told The New York Times the bigger issue is that Obama is waging a war against Christians
[23:18.080 --> 23:19.080]  in this country.
[23:19.080 --> 23:23.040]  They went on to say that the question was specifically, the question was given to him,
[23:23.040 --> 23:24.600]  was about training camps.
[23:24.600 --> 23:27.640]  He says the media wants to make this an issue about Obama.
[23:27.640 --> 23:32.920]  The bigger issue is that Obama is waging a war against Christians in this country.
[23:32.920 --> 23:37.800]  They need support and their religious liberty is at stake, he added.
[23:37.800 --> 23:40.000]  He is absolutely right about that.
[23:40.000 --> 23:41.360]  We have pointed this out many times.
[23:41.360 --> 23:43.360]  As a matter of fact, it's not the first time he's said that.
[23:43.360 --> 23:48.320]  If we go back to August the 21st, we had an article on infowars.com at the time by Kate
[23:48.320 --> 23:49.320]  Daniels.
[23:49.320 --> 23:52.520]  Trump says Muslim immigrants are treated better than Christians.
[23:52.520 --> 23:56.960]  Every immigrant in the United States is being treated better than American citizens.
[23:56.960 --> 23:57.960]  That's the real issue.
[23:57.960 --> 24:00.040]  That's the fundamental issue.
[24:00.040 --> 24:04.320]  He said it's easier for Muslim immigrants to enter the US than Christians fleeing ISIS,
[24:04.320 --> 24:05.320]  Donald Trump pointed out.
[24:05.320 --> 24:08.600]  So this is talking about when you look at the religion issue.
[24:08.600 --> 24:13.680]  This is talking about whether or not Syrian refugees are going to find a way in the United
[24:13.680 --> 24:14.680]  States.
[24:14.680 --> 24:21.280]  And he was very clear and very accurate at the time to say that it's much easier to get
[24:21.280 --> 24:25.160]  a refugee status coming out of Syria if you're not a Christian.
[24:25.160 --> 24:27.680]  If you're a Muslim, you're going to get a free ticket in.
[24:27.680 --> 24:29.880]  If you're a Christian, not so much.
[24:29.880 --> 24:30.880]  That's what he said at the time.
[24:30.880 --> 24:33.280]  He said, do you know if you're a Christian from Syria, you can't get into the United
[24:33.280 --> 24:34.280]  States?
[24:34.280 --> 24:36.640]  If you're a Muslim from Syria, it's one of the easiest places to get into.
[24:36.640 --> 24:41.360]  He says there's an assault on anything having to do with Christianity.
[24:41.360 --> 24:46.440]  The PC leftists don't want to use the word Christmas anymore at department stores.
[24:46.440 --> 24:52.440]  Well, look, we've laughed before at many times about Fox's perennial war on Christmas
[24:52.440 --> 24:53.440]  stuff.
[24:53.440 --> 24:55.840]  It's based on a PC attitude.
[24:55.840 --> 25:00.640]  They want to purge anything that has to do with Christianity, and that includes saying
[25:00.640 --> 25:02.680]  things like Merry Christmas.
[25:02.680 --> 25:09.080]  It's not only annoying, it is actually very dangerous to find this kind of political correctness
[25:09.080 --> 25:13.880]  that purges speech, that purges the free exercise of religion.
[25:13.880 --> 25:19.920]  We have to understand that our country was founded upon the free exercise of religion.
[25:19.920 --> 25:23.440]  That's why most of the people who came here from Europe came here.
[25:23.440 --> 25:27.520]  They came here to escape religious persecution in England.
[25:27.520 --> 25:34.340]  That was a key part of much of what made the basis of our law here, was based on toleration
[25:34.340 --> 25:35.680]  of different religions.
[25:35.680 --> 25:42.840]  You have to understand that when we see this being shut down with people being shamed about
[25:42.840 --> 25:46.360]  what they have to say about the free exercise of religion, of course, one of the groups
[25:46.360 --> 25:52.120]  that really pushes against this is an organization that talks about freedom from religion.
[25:52.120 --> 25:54.600]  That's not what the Constitution says.
[25:54.600 --> 25:59.400]  The Constitution says we have free exercise of religion.
[25:59.400 --> 26:04.720]  Free exercise of religion, it's freedom of religion, and you exercise it.
[26:04.720 --> 26:07.560]  You don't have to keep it in the closet.
[26:07.560 --> 26:11.400]  So now what we have is a situation where Christians, they're demanding that Christians
[26:11.400 --> 26:16.120]  keep their faith in the closet, and that's a kind of persecution.
[26:16.120 --> 26:20.600]  We don't want to see the pendulum swing back the other way.
[26:20.600 --> 26:23.360]  This is not something that's going to work out good for either group.
[26:23.360 --> 26:25.080]  We've seen this in the past.
[26:25.080 --> 26:27.240]  We don't want to see this in the future.
[26:27.240 --> 26:32.520]  And of course, there is a systemic bias against Christians in the mainstream media, as well
[26:32.520 --> 26:36.000]  as in the district of criminals in Washington, DC.
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.160]  We've talked about this many times.
[26:37.160 --> 26:42.320]  Of course, going back to July 21, we had an article on info wars.com, the persecution
[26:42.320 --> 26:47.760]  of Christians is intensifying as anti-Christian hatred sweeps the entire world.
[26:47.760 --> 26:52.720]  Now, at the time, Michael Snyder's article went down point by point, a lot of different
[26:52.720 --> 26:53.720]  countries.
[26:53.720 --> 26:54.920]  I think it was about 10 countries in this.
[26:54.920 --> 26:55.920]  First one was Iraq.
[26:55.920 --> 27:01.720]  But of course, in both Afghanistan and Iraq, we had a history in those countries that
[27:01.720 --> 27:03.400]  were predominantly Muslim.
[27:03.400 --> 27:09.440]  We had a history of some toleration of Christianity, more so than in our close ally, Saudi Arabia.
[27:09.440 --> 27:13.440]  There were Christian churches in Afghanistan, there were Christian churches in Iraq.
[27:13.440 --> 27:15.680]  Not after we took over.
[27:15.680 --> 27:18.320]  They have essentially been purged out of those countries.
[27:18.320 --> 27:19.320]  Isn't that telling?
[27:19.320 --> 27:24.160]  Once the United States got in, once the United States set up their puppets, Christianity
[27:24.160 --> 27:25.160]  was gone.
[27:25.160 --> 27:30.400]  I am more concerned about the American attitude towards Christianity than I am the Muslim
[27:30.400 --> 27:33.040]  attitude towards Christianity, quite frankly.
[27:33.040 --> 27:35.560]  But it goes on to some other countries, Kenya.
[27:35.560 --> 27:40.320]  And of course, in Kenya, in April of this year, that was where there was a massive attack
[27:40.320 --> 27:45.880]  at a university getting shot up by Muslim terrorists who came across the border.
[27:45.880 --> 27:50.360]  Similar things happening in India and Pakistan, where the Muslim terrorists are attacking
[27:50.360 --> 27:52.920]  Christians in Nigeria as well.
[27:52.920 --> 27:56.720]  And then in China, China is an interesting example.
[27:56.720 --> 28:00.000]  Because we can see there, if you're a Christian, if you're another religion, if you're not
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.560]  a religion, you can understand the kind of persecution that we've seen there.
[28:04.560 --> 28:07.560]  And here's the important thing, I think, to take away from China.
[28:07.560 --> 28:13.920]  Of course, people who had non-government approved churches, people who had home churches and
[28:13.920 --> 28:17.720]  other things like that, they were relentlessly persecuted in China.
[28:17.720 --> 28:23.800]  They did, for a while, make accommodations to people who would modify Christianity, modify
[28:23.800 --> 28:29.960]  their Bibles, so that it wasn't threatening to the Chinese Communist government.
[28:29.960 --> 28:30.960]  That ended.
[28:30.960 --> 28:34.880]  You cannot make accommodation with the government.
[28:34.880 --> 28:41.120]  Any time you do that, any time you allow them to censor your beliefs, to censor the exercise
[28:41.120 --> 28:45.160]  of your religion, it will eventually turn out, as we saw it turn out, in China.
[28:45.160 --> 28:49.440]  Now they are destroying churches, they're pulling down crosses everywhere.
[28:49.440 --> 28:54.560]  Even in Italy, we see Christians being attacked by Muslims, but the key thing is what's happening
[28:54.560 --> 28:55.560]  in America.
[28:55.560 --> 28:57.520]  And we're going to talk about that when we come back.
[28:57.520 --> 28:58.520]  Stay with us.

[33:00.920 --> 33:22.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. You're listening to an InfoWars.com
[33:22.900 --> 33:32.240]  frontline report. It's Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this
[33:32.240 --> 33:36.740]  Sunday, September 20th, 2015. I'm David Knight, your host. Alex Jones is going to
[33:36.740 --> 33:42.400]  be reporting in in the next hour with a TSA experience. It's about to get worse
[33:42.400 --> 33:47.100]  to folks. If you live in the United States in a short period of time, some
[33:47.100 --> 33:50.220]  states they're going to require the residents of some states to have a
[33:50.220 --> 33:53.540]  passport. Your driver's license is not going to be sufficient for you to travel
[33:53.540 --> 33:58.540]  within the United States. That's the arbitrary edicts of Homeland Security
[33:58.540 --> 34:05.820]  and ice and border control. The same people who leave the borders completely
[34:05.820 --> 34:10.260]  open are not going to allow American citizens to travel within the United
[34:10.260 --> 34:15.500]  States unless they live in a state that complies with real ID. They won't
[34:15.500 --> 34:20.180]  consider your driver's license to be a valid form of ID. That's the way they
[34:20.180 --> 34:23.540]  are cracking down on us. Of course, part of that is being justified by their
[34:23.540 --> 34:28.100]  open borders. So they create a crisis and here's the solution. We need to have a
[34:28.100 --> 34:34.900]  new national ID for you. I know when I ran through these problems with the TSA
[34:34.900 --> 34:38.780]  traveling on my recent vacation, I saw a lot of people having different comments.
[34:38.780 --> 34:44.060]  Look, we just completely boycott flying, they said. I agree. I think we had to try
[34:44.060 --> 34:48.980]  to boycott flying as much as we should. Let the airplane companies,
[34:48.980 --> 34:54.900]  airlines, feel that financial pressure. Nevertheless, there are times when we do
[34:54.900 --> 35:01.340]  need to fly and here's the other side of that. I refuse to allow them to keep me
[35:01.340 --> 35:06.900]  from moving around. In one way, it's a defiance. I know it's a very small thing
[35:06.900 --> 35:11.420]  to opt out of the scanner. They still are putting their hands on me to go
[35:11.420 --> 35:15.100]  through this. I still have to get their blessing and their permission. I still
[35:15.100 --> 35:18.820]  have to be treated like a criminal, like a terrorist. I have to prove to them, to
[35:18.820 --> 35:23.260]  their satisfaction, that I'm innocent. And of course, it's all theater. I
[35:23.260 --> 35:29.500]  understand all that. Nevertheless, I do what I can to oppose this at this time
[35:29.500 --> 35:34.340]  until we can get more people with us. We shouldn't have to have a frisk down to
[35:34.340 --> 35:38.420]  travel in this country. I shouldn't have to have a passport to fly within this
[35:38.420 --> 35:43.580]  country. I shouldn't have to have transportation security administration
[35:43.580 --> 35:46.220]  all over this country and it's not going to be just in the airport. So they're
[35:46.220 --> 35:50.140]  going to be out on the highways and byways and it's going to get even worse.
[35:50.140 --> 35:55.100]  There's going to be cars that are snitching on you. They're going to
[35:55.100 --> 35:58.900]  mandate talking cars. That's what the Department of Transportation Washington
[35:58.900 --> 36:03.380]  calls it. It is a process where they are going to be communicating with each
[36:03.380 --> 36:07.940]  other and with the government. We should start calling them snitch cars. I think
[36:07.940 --> 36:13.420]  it's maybe the Stasi Highway System. We're going to talk about that in detail
[36:13.420 --> 36:16.860]  as well later in the program. But I want to finish up on this back and forth
[36:16.860 --> 36:22.260]  with Donald Trump, with Obama. Is he somebody that really embraces American
[36:22.260 --> 36:26.620]  values? Of course he isn't. He doesn't embrace traditional American values. Ted
[36:26.620 --> 36:31.340]  Nugent tweeted out, if Obama is a Christian, I'm a gay vegetarian pilot.
[36:31.340 --> 36:36.260]  Look, what's behind all of this? We know that Obama, whether or not you believe
[36:36.260 --> 36:40.340]  that his Photoshopped birth certificate is acceptable or not and we can see the
[36:40.340 --> 36:43.980]  layers of the Photoshop document that was put up there. Many other things. We
[36:43.980 --> 36:48.620]  talked about the details of that document. Nevertheless, that brings up a
[36:48.620 --> 36:53.460]  question. Why would he give us a phony document? If he's legitimately born in
[36:53.460 --> 36:57.420]  Hawaii, why would they put up a document that was Photoshopped that had a lot of
[36:57.420 --> 37:02.220]  anachronisms in it as well as questionable things about the typefaces?
[37:02.220 --> 37:05.820]  If you look at that document, we've broken that down in detail. I don't believe
[37:05.820 --> 37:09.340]  that's a legitimate document. So that raises a lot of flags with a lot of
[37:09.340 --> 37:15.020]  people. But here's what's not in dispute. What's not in dispute is that Obama went
[37:15.020 --> 37:19.380]  to school in Indonesia. He grew up in a family where his mother had deep CIA
[37:19.380 --> 37:26.180]  connections. She hid out, I think, with the USAID and the anthropology section,
[37:26.180 --> 37:30.020]  as Wayne Madsen has pointed out. That's where they love to put people in the CIA.
[37:30.020 --> 37:35.180]  We know that both of her parents were connected closely in the OSS, which was
[37:35.180 --> 37:39.980]  the forerunner of the CIA. We know that his father, who adopted him in Indonesia,
[37:39.980 --> 37:45.140]  was connected with the government that was put in place by the CIA, a ruthless
[37:45.140 --> 37:49.100]  government. And as I said before, if you want to know what was going on in
[37:49.100 --> 37:53.660]  Indonesia, we haven't seen this story in the West much about what was going on
[37:53.660 --> 37:57.260]  in Indonesia and what continues to go on in Indonesia. That repressive regime,
[37:57.260 --> 38:02.180]  look at the film The Act of Killing. That'll give you some idea of what
[38:02.180 --> 38:05.660]  happened in that country. But then in addition to that, not only did he grow
[38:05.660 --> 38:10.260]  up in this oppressive, brutal, CIA-created regime where his father was
[38:10.260 --> 38:16.660]  connected politically, high up, but he also went to a Muslim madrasa. That's how
[38:16.660 --> 38:22.420]  he was educated. So when Obama comes to the United States, when he begins his
[38:22.420 --> 38:28.540]  campaign for the 2008 elections, as New York Times recounted, of course, there
[38:28.540 --> 38:31.980]  was no video of this, unfortunately, but we do have a New York Times account
[38:31.980 --> 38:38.300]  saying that he began it by doing the Muslim prayers. That makes some people
[38:38.300 --> 38:43.380]  think that maybe he's Muslim, certainly has sympathies to it. He is constantly
[38:43.380 --> 38:47.900]  criticizing Christianity, constantly praising Islam. But of course, he has
[38:47.900 --> 38:53.460]  his gods and they are fiercely worshiped. As one article from Freedom Daily says,
[38:53.460 --> 38:57.820]  Obama will do business with the Tehran Ayatollahs, but not with the Washington
[38:57.820 --> 39:02.060]  Redskins. They point out that the Redskins are considering building a new stadium in
[39:02.060 --> 39:05.860]  Washington, but the Obama administration is going to block the construction of
[39:05.860 --> 39:11.460]  the project on the current RFK stadium site unless the team changes its nickname.
[39:11.460 --> 39:14.820]  Now we're not going to block it because of crony capitalism. We're still going to
[39:14.820 --> 39:21.340]  give the billionaires the money to play in their stadiums, but unless you change
[39:21.340 --> 39:25.500]  it for political correctness reasons, he's going to block that for them. I think
[39:25.500 --> 39:28.780]  it ought to be blocked because we shouldn't be subsidizing this, but no,
[39:28.780 --> 39:33.180]  it's all about the name Redskins. So here's what they say, do chance of death
[39:33.180 --> 39:37.540]  to America offend him less than hail to the Redskins? And they point out that a
[39:37.540 --> 39:41.980]  former Redskins linebacker, London Fletcher, Colbright Bart Sports at the
[39:41.980 --> 39:46.260]  nickname, had served as a great source of pride to them. He said it meant strength,
[39:46.260 --> 39:50.500]  honor, history, and tradition. And they also point out that on the inaugural
[39:50.500 --> 39:56.540]  Redskins team in 1933, four players and the head coach were Native Americans. And
[39:56.540 --> 40:00.660]  I've seen this same type of thing happen in Florida with the Florida State
[40:00.660 --> 40:05.100]  Seminoles. There were a lot of people that were upset about that, politically
[40:05.100 --> 40:08.420]  correct liberals. And you know what, at the time, I remember how this worked out
[40:08.420 --> 40:11.780]  because I don't really follow football, but I know at the time some people who
[40:11.780 --> 40:17.460]  were really were Seminoles said, we feel honored by that. We don't want the name
[40:17.460 --> 40:21.100]  change. I don't know what happened to that particular case in Florida State. I
[40:21.100 --> 40:24.820]  haven't kept up with it. But just look at the difference that we see with this
[40:24.820 --> 40:29.700]  clock team that's being invited into the Obama White House. Now, clearly the
[40:29.700 --> 40:36.500]  police went over the top in terms of the way they treated this kid. But it looks
[40:36.500 --> 40:42.260]  like this was done possibly to provoke. This is his father was involved with an
[40:42.260 --> 40:46.740]  Islamic phobic organization. He's made a lot of political statements. And of
[40:46.740 --> 40:51.460]  course, you have to wonder why Obama has never had a problem with the police
[40:51.460 --> 40:59.260]  going stasi on the students in schools with any other issue. Somebody biting a
[40:59.260 --> 41:02.060]  pop tart into the shape of a gun and getting suspended. He's got no problem
[41:02.060 --> 41:07.020]  with that. Look at this story. Texas teen sent to in school suspension for having
[41:07.020 --> 41:10.700]  an American flag t-shirt. Is are they going to get an invitation to the White
[41:10.700 --> 41:15.860]  House? Absolutely not. But the kid that they can blame this on anti-Muslim
[41:15.860 --> 41:19.820]  feelings gets a ticket to the White House. But of course, the press says
[41:19.820 --> 41:23.900]  Donald Trump is completely wrong. There is no war on Christianity. We are not
[41:23.900 --> 41:30.460]  lifting up Islam in this country. Look, we understand what's going on. And that's
[41:30.460 --> 41:36.460]  the key to the popularity of Donald Trump. He points out the glaringly obvious
[41:36.460 --> 41:40.980]  elephant in the room and he doesn't back down. And the question is, why aren't the
[41:40.980 --> 41:45.060]  other candidates doing this? I cannot understand why we don't see the other
[41:45.060 --> 41:49.300]  candidates doing this. They are cowered down by this political correctness that
[41:49.300 --> 41:54.020]  is coming from the Democrats, coming from the media. While all this is going on,
[41:54.020 --> 41:58.940]  while we're inviting a kid who has a clock, a suitcase clock that looks very
[41:58.940 --> 42:03.260]  much like a suitcase bomb with wires and timers and a lot of electronic stuff,
[42:03.260 --> 42:07.180]  why would you put a large clock like that that looks, if you look at the
[42:07.180 --> 42:13.180]  pictures, it looks like the traditional Hollywood suitcase bomb. Why would he do
[42:13.180 --> 42:17.980]  that? And then again, as I said, the connections with his father being part of
[42:17.980 --> 42:23.900]  a anti-Islamophobic group. Very suspicious, very suspicious. And the
[42:23.900 --> 42:28.420]  hypocrisy of the Obama administration and not standing up to any of these other
[42:28.420 --> 42:33.740]  situations in school that are clearly over the top, that is the smoking gun.
[42:33.740 --> 42:40.420]  But of course, this reminder that if you retweet ISIS, you could go to jail. And
[42:40.420 --> 42:43.900]  this is coming from a tech publication pointing out that a guy who merely
[42:43.900 --> 42:49.540]  tweeted about ISIS, maybe he's a terrorist, maybe he isn't. But the speech is
[42:49.540 --> 42:53.660]  the issue. If they can take a group that they have funded, that they continue to
[42:53.660 --> 42:57.300]  fund, that they created, if they can shut people down for that, they can come after
[42:57.300 --> 43:01.620]  you for anything. Introducing secret 12, the new info wars life, vitamin B12

[47:31.660 --> 47:35.460]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight your host on this Sunday
[47:35.460 --> 47:41.700]  September 20th 2015. Joining me now is Anthony Gucciardi. In the next hour we're
[47:41.700 --> 47:46.180]  going to have Alex Jones joining us with a report. Something that happened
[47:46.180 --> 47:50.820]  with the TSA as part of his travels but I'm sure he wants to also report it in
[47:50.820 --> 47:53.900]  and thank everyone for their support through the money bomb. It's been
[47:53.900 --> 47:56.700]  overwhelming the support that we've seen from you and of course we are
[47:56.700 --> 48:01.420]  extending. Alex has extended the free shipping till midnight tonight as a way to

[48:28.660 --> 48:32.740]  those specials. We're extending those as well as a free shipping till tonight as
[48:32.740 --> 48:36.660]  a way to say thank you for your support. Thank you so much for helping us reach
[48:36.660 --> 48:40.780]  this goal so that we can launch a satellite broadcasting network that's
[48:40.780 --> 48:45.140]  going to be free to air for television stations to pick up the radio show as
[48:45.140 --> 48:49.100]  well as the nightly news and before I go to Anthony because I want to get his
[48:49.100 --> 48:53.100]  comments on this there's a new story out from the New York Times about how
[48:53.100 --> 48:58.620]  McDonald's is now leading the corporate effort to publicize the plights of
[48:58.620 --> 49:04.180]  migrants in the EU because you know that's we all have to be concerned about
[49:04.180 --> 49:08.700]  how they're going to be fed in Europe. We can't stop the war in Syria and then
[49:08.700 --> 49:12.660]  give them food there and then butt out and leave them alone. No we have to
[49:12.660 --> 49:17.660]  destroy their country and have a massive humanitarian wave come into Europe and
[49:17.660 --> 49:22.180]  then they're going to get, guess what, McDonald's food. What could be better?
[49:22.180 --> 49:26.760]  I got McDonald's along with DreamWorks, Mastercard and Facebook. This is the
[49:26.760 --> 49:30.980]  world food program they said. I would say looking at this it looks a bit
[49:30.980 --> 49:35.500]  self-serving but I guess we could ask them Anthony do you want fries with that
[49:35.500 --> 49:40.380]  interventionist war? I don't know but here's a good one. Millions of migrants
[49:40.380 --> 49:43.980]  desperate to escape war, starvation, persecution, have risked their lives in
[49:43.980 --> 49:48.220]  rickety rafts or in the case of human smugglers. Thousands have died during the
[49:48.220 --> 49:53.060]  journey. Others have been trapped at border crossings and in camps. Well yeah
[49:53.060 --> 49:57.580]  let's stop the war. Let's not, let's understand what the cause of this is
[49:57.580 --> 50:03.140]  rather than just giving them a McDonald's hamburger and before I go to
[50:03.140 --> 50:07.620]  Anthony because along this line there was a headline story coming out of the
[50:07.620 --> 50:12.220]  onion a satire site many people are familiar with but study finds average
[50:12.220 --> 50:16.620]  American inadvertently eats equivalent of eight pieces of fruit per year. They say
[50:16.620 --> 50:20.660]  the study finds a typical person accidentally ingests small fruit
[50:20.660 --> 50:24.500]  fragments or pureed fruit chunks when they are mixed in with certain meals or
[50:24.500 --> 50:28.020]  snacks like yogurt or Hawaiian pizza which over the course of 12 months adds
[50:28.020 --> 50:31.820]  up to about eight whole pieces of fruit and one of the people they in their
[50:31.820 --> 50:35.700]  fictional study here they say in the satire Samson assured the public that
[50:35.700 --> 50:38.860]  while the thoughts of unintentionally chewing or swallowing that amount of
[50:38.860 --> 50:42.900]  fruit might make them feel squeamish or repulsed these minute quantities of
[50:42.900 --> 50:45.700]  plant-based substances over the course of hundreds of meals would have very
[50:45.700 --> 50:48.580]  little impact on their health he says when people learn the foods they eat
[50:48.580 --> 50:52.740]  every day might contain tiny parts or scraps of fruit they tend to feel
[50:52.740 --> 50:57.380]  queasy however most Americans never even notice and the body naturally flushes
[50:57.380 --> 51:01.580]  out fruit and fruit residue the same way it would a cinnamon roll or a chicken
[51:01.580 --> 51:08.060]  nugget that's the state of nutrition but we got McDonald's is going to make it
[51:08.060 --> 51:12.940]  all better they're going to help the the people who have been driven out of their
[51:12.940 --> 51:18.220]  country in this war they're gonna give them some food quote-unquote right well
[51:18.220 --> 51:21.060]  I think McDonald's should fix their problems at home before they go ahead and
[51:21.060 --> 51:25.340]  try to give the refugees their toxic meals yeah and you know it's funny the
[51:25.340 --> 51:29.460]  onion says that I think it is has some validity to that of course the people
[51:29.460 --> 51:32.540]  really aren't eating fruit but at the same time it's interesting David how
[51:32.540 --> 51:35.620]  we see such tangible success when it comes to the things like the food
[51:35.620 --> 51:39.140]  movement because McDonald's is bleeding so much cash right now they don't
[51:39.140 --> 51:42.500]  actually report their losses each month anymore they don't even let the public
[51:42.500 --> 51:45.300]  know how much they're they're losing because no one wants their junk anymore
[51:45.300 --> 51:49.460]  yes that is why they're trying to do these PR moves and I think you had another
[51:49.460 --> 51:52.540]  article about how they're going to transform their line of food within the
[51:52.540 --> 51:56.020]  next ten years well they're ten years too late yeah they are ten years too late
[51:56.020 --> 51:58.740]  there's a reason they keep losing money and there's a reason people are going to
[51:58.740 --> 52:01.860]  other outlets even if it's a fast food place they're like well at least it's
[52:01.860 --> 52:05.500]  not McDonald's because they had their chance they had their chance to have
[52:05.500 --> 52:09.420]  actually high quality ingredients but instead like many companies unfortunately
[52:09.420 --> 52:13.740]  they decided to cut costs down to a penny per unit instead of getting higher
[52:13.740 --> 52:16.980]  quality stuff and they're paying the price for that exactly this other story
[52:16.980 --> 52:20.660]  that you alluded to is one that came out Friday evening on info wars
[52:20.660 --> 52:25.460]  investors demand McDonald's ban the use of antibiotics in its meat and they say
[52:25.460 --> 52:30.580]  just days after McDonald's said that it will shift to cage-free eggs over the
[52:30.580 --> 52:35.300]  next decade that's the caveat there over the next decade and it all comes down
[52:35.300 --> 52:39.620]  to that cost prohibiting thing we just talked about oh well it would cost
[52:39.620 --> 52:43.580]  three cents for us to change next year yeah exactly it would cost two point
[52:43.580 --> 52:47.100]  seven cents for us to change next year I think they need to understand that
[52:47.100 --> 52:50.100]  they're gonna starve out pretty quick they need to really make a radical change
[52:50.100 --> 52:53.500]  yeah and a lot of people realize that they're supporting good companies these
[52:53.500 --> 52:56.300]  days they know they want to support the independent companies not the ones owned
[52:56.300 --> 53:00.300]  by Coca-Cola and Pepsi like Suja juice which I used to drink all the time just
[53:00.300 --> 53:03.900]  big portion of it got out but bought out by believe it was Coca-Cola or Pepsi
[53:03.900 --> 53:07.620]  really yeah it yeah see no one knows these things and at the same time it
[53:07.620 --> 53:11.460]  also inspires me to see things like the money bomb raise so much money to see
[53:11.460 --> 53:14.740]  things like super high quality products to raise so much cash because people
[53:14.740 --> 53:17.900]  actually want to support those things yes and you know I was just talking to
[53:17.900 --> 53:21.020]  Alex earlier today and he's so thankful he's I mean he's gonna come on and tell
[53:21.020 --> 53:24.260]  everyone but he's so thankful for everything that you know you guys have
[53:24.260 --> 53:27.660]  done the listeners raising this money getting the satellite out there I'm
[53:27.660 --> 53:31.180]  thankful too to see him having such a major success and to see it's really a
[53:31.180 --> 53:35.180]  humanity level success though right yeah because it's reaching 400 plus million
[53:35.180 --> 53:38.500]  people it's helping others that would have never never been exposed to this
[53:38.500 --> 53:42.540]  stuff but you imagine flipping through the channels and you have some CNN puppet
[53:42.540 --> 53:46.060]  up there saying you know today and blah blah blah all far as fires but what in
[53:46.060 --> 53:49.780]  the next one you're like we're not gonna take it anymore 1776 what what are
[53:49.780 --> 53:54.180]  people gonna be drawn to exactly gonna be drawn to the real news media well you
[53:54.180 --> 53:57.780]  know these stories and even the one that I had there that was the parody from the
[53:57.780 --> 54:00.820]  onion saying you know average Americans are appalled to find out they're getting
[54:00.820 --> 54:05.260]  the equivalent of eight pieces of fruit the average American is not looking at
[54:05.260 --> 54:09.540]  what's in their food they're having the wool pulled over their eyes but there's
[54:09.540 --> 54:12.900]  enough people that have woken up because as you're pointing out getting the
[54:12.900 --> 54:16.140]  information out there that's what we want to do with this information we want to
[54:16.140 --> 54:19.420]  try to get this out there get people to wake up to what's being put into their
[54:19.420 --> 54:23.060]  food get them to wake up to what's being put into their government how the
[54:23.060 --> 54:26.180]  Constitution is being shredded all these different ways that people are being
[54:26.180 --> 54:30.980]  deceived because of the corporate sponsors who are working with a big
[54:30.980 --> 54:35.980]  pharmaceutical sponsors who are working with the mainstream media 75% of
[54:35.980 --> 54:40.260]  their revenues been estimated comes from Big Pharma I've got another article here
[54:40.260 --> 54:44.940]  that I'm gonna talk about later about how the new head of the FDA that Obama
[54:44.940 --> 54:50.580]  has picked has still hasn't been ratified yet by the by the Senate or
[54:50.580 --> 54:53.660]  whoever's going to do it but nevertheless this new person that he has
[54:53.660 --> 54:59.740]  picked has deep ties to pharmaceutical companies he's the most deeply tied
[54:59.740 --> 55:03.660]  person in history until you in recent history until you go back to the very
[55:03.660 --> 55:08.100]  beginnings actually the the organization just before we had the FDA the head of
[55:08.100 --> 55:11.980]  that I forget what it was called at the time but it was it was the name was
[55:11.980 --> 55:16.540]  changed to the FDA but the person who was heading it at the time they changed
[55:16.540 --> 55:22.340]  took a 180 on fluoride that was the former head of alcoa and so they were
[55:22.340 --> 55:27.260]  trying to get rid of toxic waste that was a byproduct of aluminum and so they
[55:27.260 --> 55:35.420]  completely changed it was that kind of regulatory capture that kind of crony
[55:35.420 --> 55:39.260]  capitalism and now it looks like that's the kind of guy that Obama is going to
[55:39.260 --> 55:43.820]  be appointing for the next food and drug administration the people overseeing all
[55:43.820 --> 55:47.860]  of this are not overseeing it that's why people need the information it reminds
[55:47.860 --> 55:52.020]  me of two things first it reminds me of the study in 2011 that said organic is
[55:52.020 --> 55:55.580]  just the same as conventional food and that was done by the guy that someone
[55:55.580 --> 56:00.740]  called the father of statistical wise in Graham Olken and this guy developed a
[56:00.740 --> 56:04.340]  algorithm basically statistical algorithm to make any study look a
[56:04.340 --> 56:08.100]  different way and these are other people's words not mine but then what
[56:08.100 --> 56:12.660]  happened is another study there was a meta-analysis of the original Paxil data
[56:12.660 --> 56:17.940]  the anti-psychotic antidepressant drug and anxiety and they found that the
[56:17.940 --> 56:21.860]  original data for Paxil research found that it was super detrimental caused
[56:21.860 --> 56:25.220]  massive number of different conditions and diseases I know people that have
[56:25.220 --> 56:28.740]  serious diseases like vitiligo where your skin turns white the Michael Jackson
[56:28.740 --> 56:33.460]  syndrome they looked at it again recently just last week they said well we
[56:33.460 --> 56:37.020]  can actually found that out from the original data it looks like that that
[56:37.020 --> 56:41.820]  data was viewed in a certain specific way for the drug companies yeah so all the
[56:41.820 --> 56:45.060]  studies we see these days they can be interpreted in different ways that's
[56:45.060 --> 56:47.700]  good and bad you know the good studies the bad studies they could be
[56:47.700 --> 56:50.580]  interpreted just depends how the researchers want to look at them where
[56:50.580 --> 56:53.820]  they're getting the funding from exactly and that's the key where are they
[56:53.820 --> 56:57.820]  getting the funding from and that's what we see in the history of this guy that
[56:57.820 --> 57:03.820]  Obama is about to appoint to the FDA you have a right to know what's going into
[57:03.820 --> 57:07.460]  your food to know about the drugs that they are telling you that you're going
[57:07.460 --> 57:11.860]  to be forced inject with you they need to have your consent and you need to be
[57:11.860 --> 57:16.380]  informed that is a fundamental right if we don't have that we're nothing but

[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:15.700]  war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:19.220]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night on this sunday september
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:22.980]  20th 2015 alex jones is going to be joining us this
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:26.820]  hour with a report from the road and i wanted to follow up on what i was
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:30.900]  talking to anthony gucciardi about and that is the
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:34.980]  idea of studies we were talking about how studies could be manipulated by those
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:37.380]  who fund them to say basically anything that you want to say
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:40.820]  of course there was a lot of back and forth in the last GOP debate between
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:43.540]  ben karson and donald trump i think it's cost
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:48.100]  ben karson a huge amount of support to take the position that the science is
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:53.700]  settled on vaccines i have to say science is never
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:58.340]  settled it is never settled but especially in a situation
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:02.420]  involving medications pharmaceuticals and vaccines because the vaccines
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:06.100]  themselves are constantly being changed being manipulated
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:09.700]  having different additives put into them the schedules are being changed the
[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.420]  frequency is being changed the concentration is being changed
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:18.020]  so the science is not settled and even if it were they can go back and forth
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:21.940]  and argue the merits the demerits of different vaccines different
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:25.140]  additives or adjuvants that they put into it preservatives or
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:30.020]  things to stimulate the immune system that can stimulate adverse reactions
[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.580]  that's what adjuvants are they found that in many cases
[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:36.180]  when they would inject people with vaccines that their immune system would
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:39.540]  not have the reaction to produce a passive
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:42.260]  immunity so they put adjuvants in thanks to
[01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:46.820]  irritate the immune system and some people that causes a horrendous
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:51.060]  adverse reaction so those adjuvants some of the things that they put in as
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:54.500]  preservatives those are constantly being changed but we have
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:58.660]  genetic modification being put into vaccines anything that could be
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:02.820]  injected into you now is being called a vaccine and the reason for that
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:07.460]  is that they don't have any liability that was taken away in 1986
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:12.100]  anything they cause call a vaccine is essentially something that is
[01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:15.380]  free of liability for the company so of course they're doing that now Cheryl
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:18.900]  Atkinson is a very uh we respect her great deal here at
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.860]  InfoWars I think Alex has talked to her on a number of occasions she says
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:25.780]  what the news isn't telling you about the vaccine autism studies
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:30.260]  she said a new study this week found no link between vaccines and autism it
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:33.620]  instantly made headlines on tv news and popular media everywhere
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:38.180]  many build it as the final word once again disproving the notion that vaccines
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:41.460]  could have anything to do with autism but what you didn't learn
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:45.140]  on the news was that the study was from a consulting firm that lists
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:49.700]  major vaccine makers among its clients the Lewin group
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:53.220]  the potential conflict of interest was not disclosed in the paper that was
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:56.420]  published in the new england journal of medicine the study
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:03:01.620]  authors simply declared quote the Lewin group operates with editorial
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:06.020]  independence really really a consulting
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:10.820]  lobbying firm and they act with editorial independence and she goes on to
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:14.180]  talk about how look there's been a lot of studies that
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:17.380]  do quite do show that there is a link with that
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:20.500]  she says there's 21 different scientists she lists them there
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:23.940]  she says these are just a few of the many scientists whose peer
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:27.460]  reviewed published works have found possible links between
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.660]  vaccines and autisms but unlike the Lewin group study
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:34.900]  their research was not endorsed was not promoted by the government
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:39.540]  and was therefore not widely reported in the media in fact news reports blogs
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:42.340]  and quote-unquote medical experts routinely claim
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:46.340]  no such studies exist and she clarified she said to be clear
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:51.860]  no study to date conclusively proves or disproves a causal link between vaccines
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:54.660]  and autism but despite the misreporting none have
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:58.740]  claimed to do so each typically finds either a no association
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:02.820]  or b a possible association on a narrow vaccine
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:06.660]  autism question taken as a whole the research on both sides
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:11.460]  serves as a body of evidence a body of evidence that we as individuals
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:14.500]  should be treated with the respect that we
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.860]  have that information that all of it is reported to us
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:21.860]  that the conflicts of interest are reported to us that they get our consent
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:25.780]  and that's where Ben Carson and even Donald Trump as they're arguing back
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:28.580]  and forth the merits of the demerits of vaccines or whatever
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:33.860]  it's not their decision to make if you take that decision away from us
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:38.020]  you get things like the Tuskegee experiments you get things like the
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:41.780]  experiments on people in Nazi concentration camps in German and
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:45.780]  Japanese prisoner of war camps those are horrendous abuses
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:49.860]  that were done in the name of the greater good they were prohibited
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:52.900]  by the Nuremberg amendment so they're prohibited by medical ethics and they're
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:55.860]  prohibited by the constitution and our individual

[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:21.380]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night but
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:25.700]  today alex jones is out and he is reporting in from the airport as
[01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:29.060]  i found when i was traveling recently on my vacation
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:34.420]  he has also come across some issues with the tsa as we all do
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:37.700]  and as i filed my report many people said well just don't fly just
[01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:41.780]  boycott it totally i agree i think we ought to try to reduce our flying as
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:45.540]  much as possible to put pressure on the airlines to not support
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:48.660]  this kind of authoritarian treatment at the airports
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:53.940]  but the same token i don't want to allow them to keep me in a box
[01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:56.500]  so i try to push back as much as i can when that's
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:59.940]  opting out essentially because i know they don't like to do that i don't like
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:03.060]  to do it either but i try to be a monkey wrench into the
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:06.820]  system as much as i can nothing is going to really change however
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:11.140]  until the vast number of americans stand up and say no
[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:14.820]  we can do that whenever americans stand up and say no
[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:18.580]  they always back down but they have to know that you're going to stand
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:21.540]  up for your rights that you're not going to take it anymore
[01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:24.580]  shout it i'm fed up and i'm not going to take it anymore i mean that's what we
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:28.180]  have to do collectively we have to stand collectively for individual
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:31.060]  rights instead of just surrendering this to them
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:34.900]  allowing them to control our movements and it's going to get much worse as i
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:38.180]  pointed out shortly they are going to make people who are
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:41.620]  traveling within the united states citizens within the united states carry
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:45.700]  a passport if their state has not qualified
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:51.380]  for the national id card real id so it's going to continue to get worse
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:57.220]  until we stand up and say we've had enough reporting in here's alex jones
[01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:02.100]  folks alex jones here reporting live as i board a southwest airlines flight

[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:11.300]  to attend a wedding and that's very interesting experiences up there
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.580]  analyzing what's happening to the country that fits into what i witnessed
[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:19.140]  in areas of europe by the month and a half ago i'll be back tomorrow live
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:22.820]  hosting the entire five days of the week myself and the sunday broadcast coming

[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:30.020]  visit uh to philadelphia dc and other areas
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:34.100]  his visit that's currently happening in cuba and how huge this is
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:38.340]  and more i haven't had any big tsa problems
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:42.660]  until today and because the fact that they had part of downtown shut down
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:46.980]  because of a marathon i uh got a little late to the airport
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:50.580]  and so i thought just for a test i would go ahead and do the naked body scanner
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:53.940]  i'm refusing for five years as everyone knows thought i'd do it so i could
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:58.980]  basically analyze the experience after demonstrating against it so even though
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:05.380]  i went through the entire process uh they then wanted to search us and went
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:10.660]  through all of our bags and found concord grape jelly
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:14.500]  from nebraska that i bought at a farmers market in downtown
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:17.860]  oma hall yesterday again i was not checking out the economy doing
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:21.220]  research and uh they said we're gonna let you fly
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:25.060]  today because of this violation but you're you're you're really lucky that
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.940]  we're even letting it i mean this is america we're own government
[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:31.460]  fun sizes and all kind of we're our own governorships in the major
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:34.180]  narcotics we're own government is involved in every crime you can imagine
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:37.620]  the world and they got these ridiculous internal checkpoints like dog
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:41.300]  training to prepare us to be slaves and they sit there with a straight face
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:50.020]  and searched me for 35 minutes until i barely made my plane
[01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:53.540]  and got such enjoyment out of it and they were they were closing the door as i
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:57.860]  got on southwest actually basically waited for me and the crew member i
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:01.700]  brought so this is what america and the world
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:05.620]  has turned into and it just illustrates how everything
[01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:08.740]  is about him pecking us into submission political correctness
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:13.300]  zero tolerance nanny state all of it is about training you to comply
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:16.820]  training you to be a minion and none of it keeps us safe
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:20.820]  the enemies run the country the criminals have taken over its proof
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:25.780]  its fact and i was reading today where a police chief said that black lives matter
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:29.220]  groups are targeting police are engaged in domestic terrorism it's classical
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:32.260]  terrorism that's very definition they fired him
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:36.260]  that story is only for wars dot com or share one
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:38.740]  it's just amazing to think it's a homeland security for veterans and
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:41.940]  dollars and patriots and we've done nothing and the very groups funded by
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:44.340]  soros that are meant to destabilize the country
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.780]  provided for a while i'm just sick of it i'm going to watch the court security
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:51.060]  services use this as a condition tool for general
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:55.220]  public is wrong and i stand against it we have a lot of special reports i was
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:59.540]  able to shoot video some of those to take photos the whole tsa
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:05.460]  you know confiscates grape jelly and we'll be going over all but there's so
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:08.260]  many other big epiphanies i've had a lot that on this trip
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:11.380]  david night's about to come back live but i'll be breaking this all down tomorrow
[01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:15.140]  lord wellie pray for us 11 a.m the 2 p.m the syndicated

[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:27.220]  done you definitely stand at the heart of them for wars
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:29.780]  are in alex jones from fours dot com signing off
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:33.380]  so we're back live tomorrow remember if you're listening to this transmission
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:37.060]  or watching it you are the resistance and again
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:41.780]  it's another example of what we continually see from our government
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:46.100]  completely open borders and the same people that run that homeland security
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:50.100]  are harassing us endlessly over minutiae and
[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:54.340]  silly things like grape jelly at the airport like you just heard alex report
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:57.620]  and of course there's a story that i talked about earlier from tech dirt
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:02.900]  don't retweet about isis or you could go to jail the fbi considers your retweets
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:06.340]  to be endorsements especially when it comes to chatter about a terrorist
[01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:09.860]  organization isis and they point out this is not the first time to say so the
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:12.340]  next time you see someone's twitter bio and it says
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:16.340]  retweets aren't endorsements or something along those lines know that the fbi
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:20.740]  doesn't agree with that and of course look we know that our government
[01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:24.980]  created isis are they going to arrest john mccain who was meeting with the
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:28.980]  leaders of isis we just had an article the same day
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:35.140]  as a republican debate well on cnn we had articles in mainstream press
[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:38.100]  confessions of the leader of isis talking about
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:42.500]  how he had had the cia and others help him to
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:47.700]  bring in chechen uh muslims that had been fighting russia bring them into
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:52.420]  Syria we know that our government has funded and trained and imported these
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:55.700]  terrorists and yet if you tweet about them
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:13:00.340]  then they're going to possibly put you in jail because you have to
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:03.780]  they have to maintain this control if they can establish the principle
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:08.260]  that they can do to you whatever they wish then that means that they can
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:11.140]  change the definition of terrorist at any time
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:15.460]  as they wish a terrorist can be anybody that they label as a terrorist so they
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:18.420]  have to establish these principles they're going to put the
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:22.820]  muslims out there as the boogeyman for us even though they are the ones
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:26.660]  who are equipping and funding and training the worst
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:32.420]  of the muslim terrorists out there now along those lines we had a
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:36.740]  about the back and forth in the media about donald trump and uh
[01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:42.100]  whether or not uh he should defend obama against charges that he's a muslim
[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:46.820]  we've all seen how uh he praises islam criticizes christianity
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:52.420]  and uses the federal government in a politically correct way to suppress
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:57.300]  christian expression of religion look when we see this back and forth going on
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:01.700]  about gay marriage we understand that people should be able to
[01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:05.860]  associate however they wish and there needs to be an accommodations how we
[01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:08.740]  are going to accommodate people's religious
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:12.340]  conscience along with that other freedom and there are ways that that could be
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:15.380]  done but they're not interested in exploring those ways
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:18.980]  they want to have that kind of a conflict they push
[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:22.340]  for that kind of a conflict that's what we see repeatedly
[01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:29.060]  and they've escalated the idea that now religious freedom is
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:33.620]  is subordinate to the freedom to marry whoever you wish so they
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:37.860]  sue people who do not provide services services to them because they feel that
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:41.140]  they would be participating and celebrating for that there is no
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:46.260]  accommodation whatsoever for religious freedom rather a subjugation of that
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:49.380]  so in that context of what was said back and forth between
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:53.700]  donald trump about obama and in the context of what's been going on in the
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:57.540]  last few weeks with the supreme court today on meet the press
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:01.140]  they asked candidate ben carson whether or not
[01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:06.660]  a muslim should be elected president and this is what he had to say he said i
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:09.780]  would not advocate that we put a muslim in charge of their
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:14.100]  this nation i absolutely would not agree with that that was reported by the ap
[01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:17.540]  is saying carson said that muslims shouldn't be elected
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:21.380]  president it's not quite the same thing he's putting out his opinion there you
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:23.780]  may agree or disagree with it he wasn't saying
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:27.620]  that this was something that was prohibited by the constitution or that
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:29.700]  he would prohibit he said he would not agree with it
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:33.860]  he would not advocated it they also say that he did not specify in what way
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:37.860]  islam ran counter to the constitutional principles
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:42.660]  and i think quite frankly if we look at this there are some issues with
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:46.100]  sharia law with where muslims are deriving their
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:49.140]  authority that conflict with the constitution but in the same way that
[01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:52.900]  joe biden conflicts with the constitution when he denies
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:55.940]  natural rights and the purpose of our government we'll
[01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:58.820]  talk about that more when we come back stay with us more clear than ever the

[01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:35.460]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight your host today
[01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:38.500]  we're going to get back to what we were talking about the revelation from ben
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:41.380]  karsten i want to unpack that a little bit more for you
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:45.860]  was reported ben karsten does not believe a muslim should be president
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:49.300]  what does he really mean by that what was he saying
[01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:52.660]  i want to get back to that and also look at donald trump's
[01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:56.980]  latest policy paper about the second amendment
[01:20:56.980 --> 01:21:00.900]  uh trump has only done two policy statements he's done one about immigration
[01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:05.140]  one about the second amendment both of them are very very detailed compared
[01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:08.980]  to what the other candidates have put out other candidates have a lot of issues
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:12.740]  that they talk about it's interesting to see what they choose to talk about what
[01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:15.780]  their issues are that tells us something about they give
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:18.980]  us a little bit of information about where they would go but donald trump has
[01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:22.660]  given us more detailed statements than we've seen
[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:25.860]  from any of the other candidates on most of these issues
[01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:30.420]  bush has put out a fairly detailed economic statement but
[01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:33.940]  not anything that's truly controversial about what you would expect to see from
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:37.140]  him so we're going to talk about trump's latest
[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:41.140]  policy paper the second amendment and i think whether or not you agree or
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:43.780]  disagree with these issue statements i think it
[01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:47.620]  does everybody a favor to talk about something in detail
[01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:52.100]  i mean you still have to ask yourself is this something that he will
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:54.740]  make good on is this something that has been
[01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:58.340]  uh something that he's cared about that he deeply cares about that he
[01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:01.700]  understands that is a principle or is it simply a position
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:05.460]  you'll have to make that assessment that's my problem with donald trump i've
[01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:08.180]  seen him on both sides of these issues but nevertheless
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:11.860]  let's talk about some of the issues that are brought up because he does bring up
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:16.340]  some really important issues we'll get to those in just a moment before we do
[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:19.940]  just wanted to thank you once again for supporting us in the money bomb
[01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:23.780]  that began on wednesday we had the 28 hour broadcast it was

[01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:49.300]  t-shirts and other things that are on the site that are available
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:53.060]  and you can still get free shipping for that so it's something to think about in
[01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:56.580]  terms of gifts coming up even but some of the specials that we have
[01:22:56.580 --> 01:23:01.060]  on things that will make a difference with your health 25% off survival shield

[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:38.260]  the ingredients and for example in prostagard
[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:42.740]  we are proud of the ingredients that we put in our products unlike the dark act
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:45.700]  which wants to hide the fact that many of the
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.980]  food manufacturers are using gmo products in their food
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:52.660]  we are proud of what we put in we are very careful to put in natural
[01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:55.700]  ingredients that support your body's functions naturally
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:59.460]  prostagard is a good example it has saw palm saw palmetto
[01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:04.980]  vitamin d3 lycopene plant sterols zinc many things that naturally support your
[01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:09.140]  health and take a look at the reviews that are there what people have said
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:11.620]  that it's done for them here's jerry from waterbury
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:15.220]  connecticut he says it reduces frequent urination he says i've had an
[01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:18.580]  overactive bladder for a long time and started dealing with it again
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:22.020]  recently when i heard that info wars life was selling this product i decided to
[01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:24.740]  give it a try everyone who has an overactive bladder knows
[01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:28.180]  what i mean when i say it was worth a try it's a very annoying condition it's
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:31.780]  worked for me to this point my frequency seems to have dropped to the levels of
[01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:34.980]  what it was when i was a lot younger before i had this problem
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:38.580]  another one from liberty or death 94 in the lone star state he says
[01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:41.860]  a bottle bottle for my dad he noticed results within a few days
[01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:45.860]  glad to know there's something out there that works amazing product
[01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:49.940]  you can see those reviews and many others like them again at our site info wars
[01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:54.420]  life dot com free shipping till midnight tonight and we've extended as a thank you
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:59.220]  the discounts on the products that we sell until midnight tonight
[01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:02.100]  now getting back to what ben carson had to say
[01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:06.100]  he wasn't saying that there should be a litmus test as to someone's religion
[01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:10.260]  what he said was he didn't think that islam as religion
[01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:14.420]  was compatible with the constitution perhaps and he didn't even go that strong
[01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:18.340]  he said if it's inconsistent with the values and principles of america
[01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:22.740]  then of course it should matter you know actually
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:27.300]  we look at joe biden who is now sitting on the sidelines as i said biden his
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:32.180]  time i think that he has picked up all of the
[01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:35.860]  people that have left hillary clinton certainly hillary clinton has has dropped
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:39.700]  20 percent in the polls and joe biden even though he hasn't announced
[01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:44.580]  has picked up those 20 percent and when i look at what joe biden has to say it
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:49.140]  concerns me as much as sharia law that he doesn't understand
[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:54.580]  the foundations of our government of our bill of rights of our declaration of
[01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:58.020]  independence of our constitution he fought
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:02.260]  with clarence thomas on the whole concept of natural rights
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:05.860]  during the confirmation hearings i remember that distinctively is the
[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.660]  first time i'd ever noticed joe biden he was
[01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:12.340]  absolutely incensed at the idea that we would
[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:15.700]  possess natural rights whether they're from god or whether you want to say
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:19.380]  it's just because we're human our founders said that we were given those
[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:23.140]  rights by our creator that they were therefore inalienable
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:26.100]  many if you're not a christian understand that you possess those rights
[01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:30.580]  as a human being if you wish nevertheless those rights are not as a
[01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:33.060]  human being if you are a human being you have these
[01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:36.420]  rights and they're not given to you by the government
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:40.100]  they're not privileges that are granted to you but they are fundamental rights
[01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:44.100]  that's what joe biden has a problem with and we need to understand that our
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:47.540]  government was set up to protect those individual rights that's what the
[01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:50.820]  declaration of independence said it said to protect these
[01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:54.180]  rights governments are instituted amongst men and that when the
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:58.580]  governments become destructive of those rights we have the
[01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:02.500]  right and the duty to alter or abolish that government
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:08.020]  that's the fundamental principle of america and so when we look at islam
[01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:12.340]  take a look at what the embassy of saudi arabia talks about in terms of
[01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:15.220]  legal and judicial structure they say since saudi arabia
[01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:18.020]  is an islamic state its judicial system is based on
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:21.780]  islamic law at the top of the legal system is the king
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:27.860]  who acts as the final court of appeal and as a source of pardon it's a very
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:32.180]  uh very much a king system that we broke from
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:35.540]  so it's a very different approach but here's what they have to say as well
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:40.180]  they say as sharia there is no difference between the sacred and the
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:42.980]  secular aspects of society and that's what many people
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:50.020]  are concerned about the islamic countries do not share our tradition
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:55.700]  our constitutional mandate that there be a freedom of religion
[01:27:55.700 --> 01:28:00.260]  they do not accept that saudi arabia our great ally
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:07.060]  has beheaded more people than isis has they're notorious for their
[01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:10.260]  their their intolerance of other religions
[01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:15.620]  that's what concerns everyone about it being compatible with the constitution
[01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:19.380]  they say of course that muslims derive sharia law primarily from the holy
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:22.180]  koran and of course when we talk about islam we need to understand that there's
[01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:25.620]  many different variants of it there's wahhabism which is saudi arabia
[01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:29.700]  there's the sunni islam which is in iraq there's sharia which is in
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:32.420]  iran and of course there's going to be differences
[01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:35.780]  with individuals nevertheless the concern that we have and i think what
[01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:39.460]  bin karson was talking about was are they going to respect
[01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:42.500]  the principles that we have embedded in the declaration of independence the
[01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:45.380]  principles our country was founded upon and the principles that are in the
[01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:48.500]  first amendment because we've got an article in info wars that 33 percent
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:53.780]  of the people in america can't name a single aspect of the first
[01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:56.740]  amendment maybe that's a good question in the next presidential debate we'll be

[01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:39.700]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your host today david night
[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:43.140]  at the end of the last segment we just started talking about a
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:49.300]  article that's on info wars.com 33 of the american people can't name a
[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:53.620]  single first amendment right that's a recent poll that was taken
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:57.460]  i would like to see this kind of a question at the next debate
[01:33:57.460 --> 01:34:02.980]  by the gop tell them name one of the bill of rights besides the second
[01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:05.700]  amendment and tell us what you think it's about
[01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:09.460]  or take one like the first amendment can you name the different aspects of the
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:11.860]  first amendment here's what that poll found they found that
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:16.340]  57% of the people knew that the first that freedom of speech was in the first
[01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:20.500]  amendment they found that only 19% knew that freedom of
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:24.500]  religion was in it only 10% mentioned freedom of the
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:28.900]  press only 10% mentioned the right of assembly and only
[01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:35.060]  2% knew that the right to petition was in the first amendment
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:40.260]  now 33% of the people couldn't name a single thing
[01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:44.820]  that's what is truly amazing truly amazing so i'd like to see some questions
[01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:47.780]  from the presidential candidates name some of the ass tell us
[01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:51.540]  what your favorite one of the bill of rights is and why just give us you don't
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:54.740]  have to quote it verbatim just give us a general idea of what you
[01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:58.500]  think it's about and tell us why you like it
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:02.260]  that would be truly amazing i don't think we would get
[01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:05.860]  much of a difference from from that as we do from this poll i could
[01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:09.380]  i can imagine some blank stares from many of these
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:12.980]  candidates that donald trump has put out a statement a very detailed
[01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:17.060]  statement about the second amendment and of course his position papers he's
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:21.220]  only put two of them up only two positions about issues immigration
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:24.340]  and now the second amendment just came out the last couple of days but he's
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:26.900]  been fairly detailed on that let's talk about
[01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:30.100]  his position on the second amendment it starts out
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:33.460]  very very strong he says the second amendment to our constitution is clear
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:37.620]  the right of people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed upon
[01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:42.020]  period that's a great start the rest of it he talks about is also good as he in
[01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:44.900]  the preamble he says constitution doesn't create that right
[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:48.100]  it ensures that the government can't take it away
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:52.100]  exactly right rights are things that we possess as i was saying in the last
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:55.460]  segment that we possess as human beings that are given to us
[01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:59.540]  as human beings by god government is instituted to protect those
[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:03.380]  if you grant things to people those are called privileges they're not called
[01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:06.020]  rights but then he goes on to say this is about
[01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:12.260]  self-defense plain and simple not exactly not exactly that is certainly an
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:15.060]  important aspect of why we have those rights
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:18.580]  but we also possess those rights to protect our country
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:22.900]  from foreign invasion from insurrection from dictators
[01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:27.140]  okay the second amendment is there as a check against the abuse of power by our
[01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:30.900]  own government not just foreign governments the first line of defense
[01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:35.300]  was not a standing army as a matter of fact they did not want a standing army
[01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:39.220]  there are provisions about how the army needed to be taken down after the ends
[01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:42.260]  of wars not a permanent standing army they
[01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:45.060]  considered that to be one of the greatest threats to our liberties and i
[01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:49.860]  think that we have seen that is the case it was the militia that was supposed
[01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:52.740]  to protect us not the military so it is not
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:57.220]  about self-defense that is one of the things that we have that we enjoy as a
[01:36:57.220 --> 01:36:59.940]  right but it is not about self-defense but let's talk about some of the
[01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:04.020]  specifics he has to say enforce the laws on the books he
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:06.660]  says he talks about how there's violent crime in cities like
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:12.740]  baltimore and chicago ignoring the fact that that crime is there because of the
[01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:16.500]  war on drugs and of course donald trump is talking to the republican base
[01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:20.740]  you're not going to hear the republicans criticize prohibition unfortunately
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:24.580]  they still haven't got it they still didn't learn anything from alcohol
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:26.900]  prohibition and they haven't learned anything from the
[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:30.740]  44 years of the war on drugs prohibition that we had and they also don't
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:34.100]  understand that they don't have any legal or constitutional
[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:37.540]  authority to prohibit it as i've mentioned before
[01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:41.940]  we have the 18th amendment and the 21st amendment stand as a testimony just in
[01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:45.060]  case you don't understand what the ninth and tenth amendment are about the
[01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:50.420]  fact that if the government isn't explicitly given powers those powers
[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:54.180]  remain with the people remain with the states in other words if you don't give
[01:37:54.180 --> 01:37:57.620]  a power specifically to the federal government and say this is yours to
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:38:00.900]  regulate they don't have that power and so they had to give
[01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:04.500]  themselves the power with an amendment to the constitution
[01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:08.180]  that's what the 18th amendment was about it amended the constitution so they
[01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:12.020]  had the power to prohibit alcohol alcohol alone
[01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:15.300]  and that was revoked in the 21st amendment where is the
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:19.060]  where is the amendment to prohibit any other drug or
[01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:23.220]  not just recreational drugs medical drugs drugs that you might need to fight
[01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:28.420]  cancer why would you allow the fda or the dea to
[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:32.340]  deny something that you believe you should have
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:35.540]  see we have tolerated that and now what we're staring
[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:40.100]  down the barrel of is removal of our informed consent when it comes to
[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:43.700]  vaccinations because the principle is the same if you don't own your body
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:47.700]  they can deny you medical treatment or they can force you to take medical
[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:52.180]  treatment they can also say that this is harmful for you so we're going to
[01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:55.700]  throw you in jail or kill you if you are involved
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:59.140]  with using this so it's really the war on drugs it's not
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:02.420]  the possession of guns it's dangerous and i would like to see
[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:06.580]  the republican party understand that and promote that once they do i think
[01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:10.020]  they'll get some traction but he says we have a dangerous
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:13.140]  war on drugs we have drug dealers and gang members that are given a slap on the
[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:16.340]  wrist and turn loose on the street so it needs to stop so he doesn't
[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:20.180]  acknowledge that prohibition is really the issue it goes on then to offer
[01:39:20.180 --> 01:39:23.380]  mandatory minimums which we've seen fail and the war on drugs
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:27.140]  for violent crime and i understand that if you're going to
[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:32.260]  send somebody to jail for a felon for a violent crime that they used a gun i
[01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:35.220]  don't have a problem with him getting stiff sentences
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:39.140]  but i do have a problem with mandatory minimums even though
[01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:42.500]  eric holder who called it a cookie cutter program even though he did not get
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:47.780]  rid of mandatory minimums we've seen that used against nonviolent offenders
[01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:51.060]  and understand that what's really behind that is an effort to fill up the
[01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:54.500]  private prisons that's really what's going on there i don't think
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:57.700]  that we're going to solve anything in this country by throwing even more
[01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:00.580]  people in prison we already have more people incarcerated
[01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:04.100]  than any other country including china and russia
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:08.180]  but it goes on to talk about fix our broken mental health system again
[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:11.380]  we need to be careful because a lot of republicans have jumped on the bandwagon
[01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:14.900]  to say that guns are not to blame crazy people are
[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:18.340]  and i understand there's been a lot of shootings by people who are mentally
[01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:22.100]  disturbed we have tried to point out over and over again that in
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:26.100]  every one of these cases if you look at them they've been prescribed some kind
[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:30.500]  of pharmaceutical serotonin reuptake inhibitors are favorite they make
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:34.020]  people more violent they're prescribed for people who are suicidal
[01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:38.420]  or violent in some way and yet it exacerbates that condition especially
[01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:42.580]  when they come off of those drugs yet again they do not acknowledge that
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:46.100]  system and we have to be careful that if they say that someone is mentally
[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:49.860]  incompetent to own a gun who makes that determination
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:53.700]  are we going to have a due process to make that determination
[01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:57.620]  is this going to be a federal program to determine that
[01:40:57.620 --> 01:41:01.460]  are we going to have a jury to determine that if you're going to take away
[01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:05.460]  somebody's right to own guns that ought to be considered
[01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:09.460]  the same type of due process that you would have in order to take away
[01:41:09.460 --> 01:41:12.740]  their rights to throw them in prison i think there ought to be a jury trial i
[01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:16.260]  don't think it ought to be done on the orders of a doctor i don't think it ought
[01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:19.380]  to be done with a checklist of different things or the
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:22.820]  accusation of friends or family or neighbor it
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:27.540]  needs to be once an accusation is made then take it to a court
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:31.780]  and adjudicate it just as you would if they were charged with a crime
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:34.580]  once you did that i think that would be reasonable but also
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:37.940]  acknowledge the fact that a lot of this is caused by
[01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:42.500]  ssri's but then he has some good things to say about gun and magazine bands he
[01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:45.860]  said the government has no business dictating what types of firearms are
[01:41:45.860 --> 01:41:47.940]  good honest people should be allowed to own
[01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:51.220]  them again i'm reading from donald trump's recently released
[01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:54.660]  issues statement on the second amendment then he goes to background checks and he
[01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:57.940]  points out that very few criminals are stupid enough to try and pass a
[01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:00.180]  background check they get their guns from friends
[01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:04.020]  family members or by stealing them so the overwhelming majority of people who
[01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:06.660]  go through background checks are law-abiding gun owners
[01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:10.900]  exactly right so why not get rid of it why not get rid of the background
[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:14.900]  checks that were put in to appease uh ronald
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:18.740]  reagan's uh the the wife of one of ronald reagan's friends
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:21.700]  why not get rid of those because they're totally ineffective
[01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:24.820]  he says we don't we need to fix the system we have
[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:28.740]  and we need to make it work as intended what we don't need to do is expand a
[01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:31.380]  broken system that's donald trump's program so
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:35.780]  i don't really understand what he means by fixing a system when nobody is
[01:42:35.780 --> 01:42:39.060]  really using it but finally he talks about a national
[01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:42.260]  right to carry and i want to talk about that when we come back stay with us
[01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:52.260]  we'll be right back
[01:42:57.460 --> 01:43:01.860]  kid daniels info wars dot com the recent incident involving a muslim kid
[01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:05.700]  took a realistic looking suitcase bomb to class is looking more and more like a
[01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:09.700]  staged event the father of the kid muhammad elison muhammad is a known
[01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:13.460]  islamic activist who has previously engaged in several stunts to call out
[01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:17.540]  what he labels anti-islamic activity what better stunt than the cinder kid to
[01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:20.980]  school with a look-alike bomb to later claim he was racially profiled
[01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:24.260]  political commentator pamela galler revealed that muhammad has been looking
[01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:27.140]  for publicity and chances to fight against islamic
[01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:31.220]  phobia for a long time and he gained the opportunity this past week going as
[01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:34.580]  far as the claim his son was tortured by law enforcement also if you look at
[01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:38.260]  photos of the so-called suitcase clock the kid brought to school it looks just
[01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:40.900]  like a suitcase bomb it doesn't seem weird to you that
[01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:43.620]  obama was so quick to invite the kids to the white house
[01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:47.380]  journalist steve watson covers this instant in detail at info wars dot com

[01:43:58.500 --> 01:44:02.340]  the globalist have launched a planetary destabilization plan
[01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:06.180]  here at the info wars operation we hope and pray that this is not the case
[01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:10.180]  but the signs of things deteriorating around the world are unmistakable

[01:48:07.300 --> 01:48:10.340]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host in the last
[01:48:10.340 --> 01:48:14.020]  segment we were talking about donald trump's newest
[01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:17.700]  issue statement he's had two one about immigration the other one about the
[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:21.780]  second amendment and the rights of gun owners both of
[01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:24.980]  them are very detailed and there's some good aspects in both of them
[01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:27.940]  and some things that i would disagree with not so much things that i would
[01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:31.460]  disagree with but a little bit soft on some of the edges he has a very
[01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:34.500]  strong statement with the second amendment
[01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:37.700]  rights issue statement saying that it is clearly
[01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:41.540]  a fundamental right it is not something that the government grants to us
[01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:45.060]  nevertheless he talks about how it is about self-defense
[01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:48.020]  is about much more than that i would like to see a broader
[01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:51.540]  understanding of that also some things we need to be careful about when he
[01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:55.060]  brings in mental health we've seen many in the
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:49:00.180]  conservative movement who typically understand and protect second amendment
[01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:04.820]  rights trying to trying to push back against gun
[01:49:04.820 --> 01:49:07.620]  control by saying we need to get tougher with people on the mental health
[01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:12.980]  issue ignoring the contributions of pharmaceutical drugs like SSRIs
[01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:17.380]  and also ignoring our due process we've seen how the VA has tried to take guns
[01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:21.300]  away under ridiculous pretenses from veterans
[01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:25.700]  how they have used the auto deposit of checks disability checks to say that
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:28.900]  you're incompetent and therefore you're going to lose your
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:33.460]  your ability your right to own guns so we need to have a clear legal process i
[01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:35.780]  would like to see a discussion and mention of that
[01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:39.220]  nothing like that in here but let's go to the one that we did not discuss yet
[01:49:39.220 --> 01:49:44.580]  the last aspect of uh donald trump's second amendment rights statement
[01:49:44.580 --> 01:49:48.500]  talks about a national right to carry he says the right of self-defense
[01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:52.340]  doesn't stop at the end of your driveway that's why
[01:49:52.340 --> 01:49:56.100]  i have a concealed carry permit why tens of millions of americans do that permit
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:58.260]  should be valid in all 50 states and we understand
[01:49:58.260 --> 01:50:02.580]  that this has been a an entrapment device in states like
[01:50:02.580 --> 01:50:06.820]  chris christie's new jersey not recognizing people who have a valid
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:10.740]  concealed carry a license uh there was just recently a case about a
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:13.620]  man in north carolina who traveled on business construction
[01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:17.220]  business he had a gun it was stowed away in his car
[01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:20.820]  he had a concealed carry permit that was valid in north carolina but when they
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:24.260]  found it in new jersey they want to send him to jail
[01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:30.100]  for years there was another case uh last year about a fellow who was moving his
[01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:34.420]  household and his family was concerned about him they
[01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:37.220]  called the police because they did not see him where they
[01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:40.660]  thought he was going to be he was running very late the police found him
[01:50:40.660 --> 01:50:44.020]  they pulled him over they wanted to look through his trunk at the bottom of his
[01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:47.380]  trunk underneath his possessions his clothes and everything else they found
[01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:52.980]  a firearm he had a permit to use that in his
[01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:56.740]  state he had a concealed carry permit it was stowed in his trunk under
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:58.980]  everything else while he was moving nevertheless
[01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:02.340]  they were trying to put him away for 10 years that kind of entrapment
[01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:05.860]  is horrific that we see that happens in many of the northeastern states
[01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:09.380]  and so it's great that uh donald trump is addressing that and the idea that
[01:51:09.380 --> 01:51:12.500]  people should not be banned from carrying guns on military bases and
[01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:16.500]  recruiting centers that's certainly something that the president could do by
[01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:20.420]  order nevertheless we also need to be careful he
[01:51:20.420 --> 01:51:23.940]  draws the analogy to a driver's license that works in every state
[01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:27.460]  and uh i agree it ought to be recognized in every state they should not be able
[01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:31.380]  to send somebody who is a law-abiding citizen who's qualified another state
[01:51:31.380 --> 01:51:35.060]  and trap them and send them to jail but we need to understand that even with
[01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:39.620]  driver's licenses we now have this real id act
[01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:43.140]  that is now going to if you if your state doesn't comply with what homeland
[01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:46.340]  security wants to see happen in terms of real id
[01:51:46.340 --> 01:51:50.020]  you're going to have to have a passport to fly this is going to be coming up
[01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:53.460]  in just a few months for domestic flights you can be an american citizen
[01:51:53.460 --> 01:51:56.900]  you're going to have to have a passport to fly from one position to the other
[01:51:56.900 --> 01:52:00.740]  and they have singled out starting in 2016 residents of
[01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:04.740]  new york wisconsin louisiana minnesota new hampshire
[01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:08.100]  and american samoa there you go american samoa we're going to nail those
[01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:11.940]  people i don't know what that is but there's going to be possibly other
[01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:15.460]  states that's just kind of their arbitrary list you didn't go through
[01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:18.900]  and do it exactly the way they want to do so now homeland security
[01:52:18.900 --> 01:52:23.460]  is going to require people in those uh states to have a passport to fly
[01:52:23.460 --> 01:52:27.140]  domestically americans will need a passport to travel within their own
[01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:30.740]  country so we have to be careful with a government that
[01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:34.500]  operates like this that we don't allow something like
[01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:39.300]  a national right to carry to be a a way for the government
[01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:43.620]  to set themselves up as the arbiters of who gets
[01:52:43.620 --> 01:52:46.500]  a carry permit we don't want the federal government
[01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:50.740]  defining who gets a concealed carry permit we don't want them taking over
[01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:54.900]  that process either so there some of these things are very good and i
[01:52:54.900 --> 01:52:58.340]  understand the reasons for them but we need to have make sure that we have
[01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:02.180]  due process before they take away our guns if somebody accuses us of not being
[01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:05.380]  mentally competent we need to make sure that the federal government
[01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:09.460]  is not going to have any role whatsoever in terms of concealed carry that
[01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:12.180]  they're not going to pull this in in the back door that's not being paranoid
[01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:16.020]  we've seen this kind of thing happen over and over again
[01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:19.300]  from our government now we're looking at the different candidates today we've
[01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:22.900]  talked a lot about the ones who are at the top those who are not
[01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:26.340]  professional politicians those who have not been elected to office before
[01:53:26.340 --> 01:53:30.340]  donald trump ben carson carly fiorina is another one
[01:53:30.340 --> 01:53:34.340]  and of course when fox news reported uh trump's
[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:38.340]  policy paper on the second amendment they say well this is a radical departure
[01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:41.700]  from gun control i point out that in the past
[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:45.460]  he has supported many of the aspects of gun control so they're suspicious about
[01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:48.980]  him but they're not suspicious about carly fiorina
[01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:53.780]  no fox news loves her she's their darling i want to take a look at
[01:53:53.780 --> 01:53:57.460]  some of the aspects of carly fiorina that we have not talked about of course we
[01:53:57.460 --> 01:54:02.580]  talked about her connections with the cia that's her only real government
[01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:06.340]  experience is working with michael hayden of the cia
[01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:10.820]  on dragnet surveillance on americans uh that ought to you know i would support a
[01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:15.300]  carly for prison t-shirt just like i would support a hillary for prison t-shirt
[01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:19.140]  based on that basis i don't know exactly what she did with him but
[01:54:19.140 --> 01:54:22.020]  certainly something we should look into and certainly not anything that
[01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:25.460]  qualifies her for the presidency or any kind of government
[01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:29.700]  qualification that i would agree with before i get into the carly fiorina
[01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:33.300]  video that i want you to see what she's had to say about hillary clinton
[01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:37.300]  i just want to let you know that uh alex a alex has extended
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:40.660]  the money bomb specials until midnight tonight
[01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:44.180]  that's free shipping and big discounts on the products that we have there we

[01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:33.140]  we have free shipping now to carly fiorina we've
[01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:36.260]  talked about ben carson and his comments about whether or not
[01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:40.260]  a muslim should be president we've talked about donald trump and the
[01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:43.220]  press attacking him because he didn't defend obama
[01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:47.380]  and we've talked about donald trump's latest policy statement on gun control
[01:55:47.380 --> 01:55:52.100]  what about carly fiorina is she running merely on the fact that
[01:55:52.100 --> 01:55:54.900]  she is a woman of course the things that we're supposed to be
[01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:58.340]  excited about with carly fiorina is that she's a woman and that she's been a
[01:55:58.340 --> 01:56:02.580]  ceo of hula packard and of course there are some big
[01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:06.340]  issues with her tenure there at hula packard i've got a short commercial i
[01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:09.300]  want to play for you about that but listen to what she had to say
[01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:13.700]  about hillary clinton being a great candidate
[01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:17.780]  best is why perhaps i have such great admiration
[01:56:17.780 --> 01:56:22.980]  and empathy for hillary clinton i have great admiration for her
[01:56:22.980 --> 01:56:29.540]  because i know what it takes in some small measure to do what she has done
[01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:36.180]  she is obviously incredibly intelligent focused tough
[01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:41.780]  determined empathetic of all the tens of millions of people that she was trying
[01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:46.100]  to represent in her quest to become the first woman president of the united
[01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:50.020]  states and as a woman i take great pride in the
[01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:55.700]  fact that hillary clinton ran for president and i also
[01:56:55.700 --> 01:57:01.620]  watched with a lot of empathy as i saw how she was
[01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:08.100]  scrutinized characterized talked about as a woman
[01:57:08.100 --> 01:57:11.700]  well i think yeah let's hold that right there okay so see she has a lot of

[01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:33.700]  antidote to hillary clinton running as a woman but you should vote for
[01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:37.380]  harley fiorena simply because she's a woman
[01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:40.900]  that's exactly the kind of thing that we saw
[01:57:40.900 --> 01:57:45.940]  when she was pushing her daughter's death from a drug overdose of alcohol and
[01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:50.820]  prescription drugs and talking about marijuana stay with us we'll be back
