[00:00.000 --> 00:26.880]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show this January 11th 2017 it's an amazing day
[00:26.880 --> 00:29.520]  we've had a lot of news breaking of course Donald Trump having his first
[00:29.520 --> 00:33.860]  press conference in six months and just hours before the press conference we
[00:33.860 --> 00:38.960]  had this massive new fake news attack coming from hardcore Hilary supporters
[00:38.960 --> 00:43.440]  BuzzFeed I mean we got tweets from the BuzzFeed editors all last night one
[00:43.440 --> 00:49.360]  after the other talking about how they're an absolute fear so we this is
[00:49.360 --> 00:53.000]  something that is developing Alex Jones is on the road he wanted to call in
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.640]  with this report we got Alex on the line right now Alex that's Ronald be co-hosting
[00:56.640 --> 00:59.760]  with you here David that's sorry they didn't really that message to you wow
[00:59.760 --> 01:03.720]  there is so much to break down here so much to go over I mean I mean it is
[01:03.720 --> 01:09.960]  simply mind-blowing that that I saw this story over a day ago about the Golden
[01:09.960 --> 01:14.680]  showers I knew it was pure absolute bull and then I saw it and I just said you
[01:14.680 --> 01:18.040]  know what I'm gonna leave it alone I'm gonna see a mainstream media picks this
[01:18.040 --> 01:20.960]  up which I'm sure they would and then and then see where it went from there
[01:20.960 --> 01:24.920]  with BuzzFeed and the rest of them but of course it was Taylor made a
[01:24.920 --> 01:31.040]  disinformation just like their CIA report of last week I mean the CIA report
[01:31.040 --> 01:36.160]  of last week admittedly was just a bunch of examples of where RT had said bad
[01:36.160 --> 01:41.080]  things about Hillary Clinton in the last four years this was their hack was just
[01:41.080 --> 01:48.120]  simple political involvement by the Russians having political views on
[01:48.120 --> 01:52.320]  something like peace with America this is their big much to do about nothing
[01:52.320 --> 01:56.680]  bombshell information but now they've really bitten off more than they can
[01:56.680 --> 02:04.480]  chew with with MSM as you know running with the claims unsubstantiated that
[02:04.480 --> 02:10.600]  the president is in these parties being urinated on basically now now meanwhile
[02:10.600 --> 02:15.680]  we have Bill Clinton flying around with Jerry Epstein the convicted pedophile
[02:15.680 --> 02:21.080]  more than now 20 times who went to a pedophile island who flew to an island
[02:21.080 --> 02:26.280]  with a sheik as well and also travels the Middle East with known pedophiles we
[02:26.280 --> 02:29.960]  have Bill Clinton and all of his sexual criminal background we have all the
[02:29.960 --> 02:34.160]  incredible stuff and all the bizarre spirit cooking all the Satanism and all
[02:34.160 --> 02:38.080]  the Alistair Crowley stuff and all the bizarre Hollywood stuff and then we have
[02:38.080 --> 02:45.080]  Roman Polanski raping a 13 year old girl that's one he just got caught for in
[02:45.080 --> 02:49.720]  Hollywood defending him and trying to get his conviction of child rape
[02:49.720 --> 02:55.560]  overturned so he could he could come here from France battling his extradition
[02:55.560 --> 03:00.320]  and you've got Meryl Streep standing up with standing ovations for an admitted
[03:00.320 --> 03:05.280]  child rapist I'm expecting media matters to come out and say that Roman Polanski
[03:05.280 --> 03:10.440]  never raped a 13 year old girl amily so so this is what we're dealing with is
[03:10.440 --> 03:17.000]  people with a real history of obsession with sexual perversion no Donald Trump
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.400]  has an obsession with beautiful perfect ten women and I don't think anybody's
[03:21.400 --> 03:25.520]  gonna say that's a crime he's ever claimed to be you know you know Mr. Perfect
[03:25.520 --> 03:30.000]  but he's been married several times he has a great family the point is is that
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.440]  this is how desperate they are David so I'm gonna be here with you off and on a
[03:33.440 --> 03:37.000]  little bit in the first hour we've got the full press conference of Trump it's
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.360]  still ongoing we're gonna be airing some excerpts of that again he's come out
[03:41.360 --> 03:46.120]  and said this is absolute total bull spices come out and said it's total
[03:46.120 --> 03:49.880]  bull previous has said it's 100% manufacture but notice for the first
[03:49.880 --> 03:56.760]  day David they were absolutely celebrating celebrating in rapture that
[03:56.760 --> 04:01.640]  they had Donald Trump a secret report why this is why Trump didn't want a war
[04:01.640 --> 04:07.240]  with the Russians this is why because because they had PP videos of the
[04:07.240 --> 04:13.400]  president totally insane no Trump's being advised by a bunch of top generals who
[04:13.400 --> 04:16.600]  were not pro-russia who were not anti-russia but who were actually pro
[04:16.600 --> 04:21.400]  America and it's not in our interest to pick on Russia when Russia is not an
[04:21.400 --> 04:26.840]  expansive expanding role right now and China is we should be working with Russia
[04:26.840 --> 04:33.120]  Japan and others to contain Russia to contain China and that is indeed what's
[04:33.120 --> 04:38.160]  happening right now is real geopolitical activity to also not just contain
[04:38.160 --> 04:42.960]  communist China that's expanding but to contain radical orthodox Islam that is
[04:42.960 --> 04:47.480]  openly expanding as everybody can publicly see so we're seeing is real
[04:47.480 --> 04:51.040]  national sovereignty we're seeing a president who's gonna be in there in
[04:51.040 --> 04:55.480]  nine days now actually doing things that are in the national interest of this
[04:55.480 --> 04:58.840]  country David absolutely Alex and of course one of the things that he talked
[04:58.840 --> 05:02.400]  about in the press conference right back and find their news sources if you
[05:02.400 --> 05:06.200]  recall they first suggested that the Russians hacked the election to help get
[05:06.200 --> 05:09.760]  Donald Trump elected and yesterday they're reporting now that intel chiefs
[05:09.760 --> 05:14.040]  are presenting Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him what
[05:14.040 --> 05:17.320]  they're insinuating directly quoting here from their website classified
[05:17.320 --> 05:20.920]  documents presented last week the president Obama and president elect
[05:20.920 --> 05:24.040]  Trump included allegations the Russian operatives claimed to have
[05:24.040 --> 05:28.120]  compromising personal and financial information about Trump this of course
[05:28.120 --> 05:32.080]  is coming from quote multiple US officials with direct knowledge on the
[05:32.080 --> 05:35.920]  briefings oh really what they're insinuating is that the Russians have
[05:35.920 --> 05:40.680]  finance secrets and sexual deviant secrets about Trump that could be used to
[05:40.680 --> 05:44.240]  blackmail him they're also claiming that one reason the nation's intelligence
[05:44.240 --> 05:47.960]  chiefs took an extraordinary step of including the synopsis in the briefing
[05:47.960 --> 05:52.080]  of documents was to make Donald Trump aware that such allegations involving
[05:52.080 --> 05:55.480]  him were circulating among their agencies I can't make this up if I tried
[05:55.480 --> 06:00.600]  I'm Margaret hell reporting for info wars.com we have the new product in

[08:10.560 --> 08:18.840]  network welcome to the Alex Jones show on this January 11th 2017 I am David
[08:18.840 --> 08:21.920]  Knight and of course today we had the press conference it was scheduled first
[08:21.920 --> 08:25.200]  one of six months by Donald Trump they were going to talk about what Donald
[08:25.200 --> 08:28.200]  Trump is going to do with conflict of interest and they did talk about that
[08:28.200 --> 08:31.680]  we're going to give you some clips of that but then of course Buzzfeed dumped
[08:31.680 --> 08:36.800]  this trash just hours before the press conference joining us now is Alex Jones
[08:36.800 --> 08:40.280]  comment on what's going on that's right David and again you're going to be
[08:40.280 --> 08:43.680]  hosting the show today doing a great job I obviously will be popping in live and
[08:43.680 --> 08:48.840]  also filing some reports you know I saw this Buzzfeed thing yesterday and I was
[08:48.840 --> 08:51.800]  going to comment on it but I just I just knew it was gonna come out that it was all
[08:51.800 --> 08:56.800]  false so I wanted to wait and see what develops but obviously the press
[08:56.800 --> 09:00.320]  conference is still ongoing it's been going on for more than an hour and a half
[09:00.320 --> 09:05.520]  we've already got excerpts of it coming up we're gonna in fact play about to 10
[09:05.520 --> 09:09.360]  15 minutes of it here in just a moment from the start of the press conference
[09:09.360 --> 09:13.520]  from about an hour and a half ago so that's going to be interspersed
[09:13.520 --> 09:18.360]  throughout the broadcast today also McAfee obviously an expert on computers
[09:18.360 --> 09:22.880]  is going to be joining us to break down the Russia report what it's like in the
[09:22.880 --> 09:27.120]  age of the internet when these disinfo pieces can be put out and more but
[09:27.120 --> 09:33.680]  notice it's the mainstream media again running with a ridiculous easily
[09:33.680 --> 09:41.000]  debunkable story that they claim was part of some secret CIA report that the
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.560]  president has been blackmailed by the Russians because they have video of him
[09:45.560 --> 09:50.000]  with women urinating on each other now yeah and I'm sorry to have to talk about
[09:50.000 --> 09:55.120]  that on air but that's what's being put in the news so we have to cover it it is
[09:55.120 --> 10:00.200]  Jerry Epstein of the Lolita Express and the Clintons that are clearly involved
[10:00.200 --> 10:05.320]  in the entire pedophile network it is the Clintons that are clearly involved
[10:05.320 --> 10:09.800]  with a whole Hollywood elite and the Roman Polanskis and the Merrill Streeps
[10:09.800 --> 10:17.480]  who apologize for pedophilia and who basically champion it this is the group
[10:17.480 --> 10:21.280]  that is into all this we know that it comes out over and over and over and
[10:21.280 --> 10:28.800]  over again that this satanic degenerate ruling class is into this Donald Trump
[10:28.800 --> 10:33.400]  and knows they're into it Donald Trump is exposing it Donald Trump is aware of
[10:33.400 --> 10:38.240]  what's happening and so time and time again they try to say Donald Trump is
[10:38.240 --> 10:43.880]  what they are so the worst they could try to make up or dig up was Donald
[10:43.880 --> 10:50.560]  Trump in a room with prostitutes doing disgusting things when meanwhile it's a
[10:50.560 --> 10:54.240]  perfect metaphor the globalist as I've said many times are marking their
[10:54.240 --> 10:59.600]  territory and are doing this to us the American people in an act of control and
[10:59.600 --> 11:03.840]  domination so again ladies and gentlemen Trump comes out with this press
[11:03.840 --> 11:08.280]  conference the day before they drop all this disinfo out and they don't even
[11:08.280 --> 11:14.680]  care that that they're known liars in their vitriol to try to bring Trump
[11:14.680 --> 11:21.440]  down with only nine days left until he's in office now I've told people I'm a
[11:21.440 --> 11:25.880]  vacation on my family but that's become a whole other conspiracy even if I leave
[11:25.880 --> 11:32.240]  for a week I'll be back next week but regardless I'm doing a workcation but
[11:32.240 --> 11:37.160]  just while I'm out here in America talking and meeting with people
[11:37.160 --> 11:40.760]  everybody I talked to basically is against political correctness now almost
[11:40.760 --> 11:45.000]  everybody there is a total awakening taking place and that's why they're so
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.000]  scary we talk a lot about that David but again we have to ask ourselves why
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.080]  would MSM caught line caught putting out fake news only intensify the fake news
[11:55.080 --> 12:00.440]  because they know they're out of ammo they know they're discredited they know
[12:00.440 --> 12:04.560]  that people are starting to really wake up to them so they're simply trying to
[12:04.560 --> 12:09.080]  do a Hail Mary and hope that something sticks hopes that you know something
[12:09.080 --> 12:14.480]  gets picked up by the public that the public even if we only believe one out
[12:14.480 --> 12:19.840]  of 20 lies that you know that that that finally something works finally something
[12:19.840 --> 12:25.160]  begins to bring down Donald Trump but the good news is it's up on infoworks.com
[12:25.160 --> 12:30.160]  right now the president of Hungary is moving to kick out the George Soros
[12:30.160 --> 12:35.840]  Foundation from his country all over the world Soros crime networks globalist
[12:35.840 --> 12:39.560]  crime networks are being exposed and being thrown out of nation states as we
[12:39.560 --> 12:45.480]  identify the globalist tentacles of this Hydra of this system of this octopus
[12:45.480 --> 12:50.360]  it's it's came over and so we're reaching that historic point that doesn't mean
[12:50.360 --> 12:53.080]  there won't be other political challenges it doesn't mean there won't
[12:53.080 --> 12:56.440]  still be corruption doesn't mean there still won't be problems doesn't mean
[12:56.440 --> 13:02.240]  there won't still be large pieces of the broken-up wreckage of the global crime
[13:02.240 --> 13:08.400]  syndicate but their total organization and their total focus and their total
[13:08.400 --> 13:13.520]  operating in the dark with no one even resisting them is coming to an end right
[13:13.520 --> 13:18.680]  now so I want to go to the intro this press conference with Spicer and then
[13:18.680 --> 13:24.040]  and then with Pence and then with Trump where most of the meat gets said we're
[13:24.040 --> 13:27.400]  going to have X services I said throughout the next four hours David has
[13:27.400 --> 13:31.160]  some big yesterday but David that's my take on this what's your take well Alex
[13:31.160 --> 13:35.840]  I think when we look at Trekkie Schumer this previous fake news that we had
[13:35.840 --> 13:38.400]  about the Russian hack and we're going to talk to John McAfee later in the show
[13:38.400 --> 13:42.280]  about that Chuck Schumer said you better be careful about talking about
[13:42.280 --> 13:46.760]  intelligence services they have a way of making you pay for this I think that
[13:46.760 --> 13:49.480]  that's what's really behind this when we look at the sources of course we've got
[13:49.480 --> 13:53.880]  CNN and Buzzfeed that are the direct sources but I think that there's more to
[13:53.880 --> 13:57.200]  this than that and one of the things that came out today Alex that we want to
[13:57.200 --> 14:01.920]  talk about later in the show as well is the fact that Robert Kennedy our RFK
[14:01.920 --> 14:07.680]  junior has been appointed to a vaccine commission by Donald Trump and of course
[14:07.680 --> 14:13.040]  both Robert Kennedy and Donald Trump have spoken about concerns about the
[14:13.040 --> 14:18.720]  safety and the efficacy of vaccines I think these types of things the vaccine
[14:18.720 --> 14:23.000]  issues of the calling them out on the missing 28 pages of 9-11 report and so
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.720]  many other things they can't control Donald Trump they're very much afraid of
[14:26.720 --> 14:30.400]  him he comes out against the establishment that and the fact that he
[14:30.400 --> 14:34.720]  understands this fake news from the CIA he's not being fooled by this he's not
[14:34.720 --> 14:38.960]  fooled by the intelligence reports so-called reports so I think a lot of
[14:38.960 --> 14:41.680]  that is the basis of that but we're gonna take a look at the sources we're
[14:41.680 --> 14:45.520]  gonna look at the organizations we're gonna look at the timing later on well
[14:45.520 --> 14:50.480]  that's right I mean let's get into RFK junior he's bad on issues like guns
[14:50.480 --> 14:53.920]  he's bad on things like that but he's had family that's been hurt by vaccines
[14:53.920 --> 14:58.520]  he knows about the danger she's been on the show before and you know I know he
[14:58.520 --> 15:01.680]  met with Trump privately and Trump said yes I'm probably gonna put you on a
[15:01.680 --> 15:06.680]  commission I've got to get in first and he basically told RFK junior do not
[15:06.680 --> 15:12.720]  talk about this well RFK junior shot his mouth off and so Trump came out and
[15:12.720 --> 15:18.720]  said yes we did talk yes we're planning something it's not done yet so again
[15:18.720 --> 15:22.520]  RFK I'm not trying to be mean here but when the president literally meets with
[15:22.520 --> 15:25.600]  people behind the scenes and battle plans they have to get their mouths shut
[15:25.600 --> 15:28.800]  we're trying to take the country back this is not a game it's not a joke I
[15:28.800 --> 15:32.840]  mean look folks Trump is behind the scenes planning the total return of the
[15:32.840 --> 15:37.680]  Republic and again I'm not a liberty to get into this so I'm just gonna drop it
[15:37.680 --> 15:42.760]  right here but I don't get this from Trump because it's from multiple other
[15:42.760 --> 15:48.480]  sources this is very very personal for Trump on the vaccines okay so so so
[15:48.480 --> 15:53.480]  seeing is believing there's a reason Trump's so awake and again I'm not a
[15:53.480 --> 15:57.800]  liberty to get to the rest of it but just imagine the radio shows he listens
[15:57.800 --> 16:03.360]  to every day imagine what what Donald Trump tunes into at about midnight every
[16:03.360 --> 16:08.440]  night and imagine what Donald Trump's listening to and imagine how smart he is
[16:08.440 --> 16:14.160]  and his 70 years of research and knowledge when he tunes into shows that
[16:14.160 --> 16:18.800]  are also obsessed with facts and knowledge it all starts to click it's
[16:18.800 --> 16:22.040]  not just us that are going through a quickening of awakening it's other
[16:22.040 --> 16:27.720]  people that are going through a quickening as well like Donald Trump and
[16:27.720 --> 16:31.640]  so let me tell you what Donald Trump wants he wants the return of men the
[16:31.640 --> 16:36.560]  return of leadership the return of the family the return of good medicine the
[16:36.560 --> 16:41.920]  return of sovereignty the return of people having savings the I mean you
[16:41.920 --> 16:47.440]  across the board Trump is dead on he's such an old-timer though he isn't
[16:47.440 --> 16:53.200]  really up on non-gmo and stuff is his wife is his daughter is so that's the
[16:53.200 --> 16:57.520]  good news but also in this press conference today and there's so many
[16:57.520 --> 17:01.660]  clips he goes you got to really watch it today with the internet there's
[17:01.660 --> 17:05.880]  microphones inside everything there's microphones inside your appliances
[17:05.880 --> 17:09.360]  there's cameras everywhere of course the media's gonna call him crazy Betrayus
[17:09.360 --> 17:13.200]  four years ago said you're washing machines listening to you I told people
[17:13.200 --> 17:18.240]  that 20 years ago well I was reading it in the MIT quarterly I mean they said
[17:18.240 --> 17:22.800]  this it's not like I made up the Internet of Things or or smart desk
[17:22.800 --> 17:27.120]  where I skipped this break so this is such an amazing time to be alive it's
[17:27.120 --> 17:29.840]  very very positive but but but David I'm gonna skip this breaks we have more
[17:29.840 --> 17:35.040]  time I want to go back to you because I've been listening to you while I took
[17:35.040 --> 17:39.800]  off some time while I did some did some well-watching with the family and then
[17:39.800 --> 17:43.000]  things I've always wanted to do I've been listening to you and then I'm not
[17:43.000 --> 17:47.000]  just kissing your butt the amazing job you and the crew have been doing and
[17:47.000 --> 17:50.320]  just and just really laying out the facts I mean I really want your view on
[17:50.320 --> 17:55.120]  this because I was intrigued by what you just mentioned how CNN and Buzzfeed
[17:55.120 --> 18:00.580]  quarterbacked the release of this obvious disinfo so gleefully knowing it was
[18:00.580 --> 18:05.800]  pure bull I read it I could tell it was bull I read the CIA report last week it
[18:05.800 --> 18:08.680]  was like a five-year-old you know telling on their older brother like oh
[18:08.680 --> 18:13.480]  look and then they said Hillary might have health problems and oh look you know
[18:13.480 --> 18:18.360]  didn't they had this Trump person on and oh look Trump went on Larry King oh my
[18:18.360 --> 18:23.120]  gosh I mean every news channel was attaching Trump every commentator
[18:23.120 --> 18:27.600]  Hollywood foreign governments foreign leaders the whole world ganged up on
[18:27.600 --> 18:32.120]  America and told us we couldn't have Trump we said no we do want Trump we
[18:32.120 --> 18:35.360]  want nationalism we want to change and then they have the nerve to turn around
[18:35.360 --> 18:40.440]  and say that foreign powers intervene little bitty Russia and my little bitty
[18:40.440 --> 18:46.880]  I mean their GDP is that of Italy they're strong smart scientific people but
[18:46.880 --> 18:51.640]  let's face it Russia's been through 80 years of hell Russia is is is a joke when
[18:51.640 --> 18:55.920]  it comes to manipulating the United States this is this is absolute bull but
[18:55.920 --> 18:59.320]  it wasn't a joke to see all these world powers all these governments all these
[18:59.320 --> 19:04.880]  big combines all the big banks all the big media everybody the Pope told
[19:04.880 --> 19:08.360]  Catholics you know the two to two vote against Trump didn't happen I mean
[19:08.360 --> 19:11.280]  record number of Hispanics voted for Trump record number of blacks voted
[19:11.280 --> 19:16.640]  record number of women voted they are 35% of Hispanics voted for Trump 45% of
[19:16.640 --> 19:19.960]  women voted for Trump and that's even with them stealing states and skewing
[19:19.960 --> 19:25.320]  numbers the word is it was even higher David it was like 42% Hispanic is what
[19:25.320 --> 19:31.080]  internal poll show it was 50% women internal poll show exit poll show that's
[19:31.080 --> 19:34.480]  what we know they stole five states that's why they're in panic because the
[19:34.480 --> 19:38.400]  minorities are not smoking the brainwashing dope anymore and are
[19:38.400 --> 19:42.680]  breaking free the only people that aren't are all the weird kind of like the
[19:42.680 --> 19:47.360]  white savior brainwash minions that I mean let's just say it but who's
[19:47.360 --> 19:52.120]  doubling down is weird weird brainwash left us white people and they have gone
[19:52.120 --> 19:57.480]  into a total bunker mentality of insanity like Hitler and his bunker
[19:57.480 --> 20:00.120]  giving orders to armies that don't exist and I'm really worried about what
[20:00.120 --> 20:03.640]  they're going to do next so so first off what is your take on this bus fee
[20:03.640 --> 20:08.520]  just a few minutes on this well yeah Alex what do you think they're going to
[20:08.520 --> 20:12.800]  do next in the next nine days after the hysteria we've already seen well you
[20:12.800 --> 20:15.880]  know it's interesting Alex because you had CNN and you had BuzzFeed come out
[20:15.880 --> 20:19.400]  with this at this at this time and we've had news organizations that are very
[20:19.400 --> 20:23.040]  leftist that have not been fair in the past that have supported Hillary and
[20:23.040 --> 20:26.160]  made a lot of unfair accusations about Donald Trump people like the New York
[20:26.160 --> 20:30.880]  Times heaping scorn on BuzzFeed and CNN for running with this story Mika
[20:30.880 --> 20:34.920]  Brzezinski doing that people who are not willing to burn down their leftist
[20:34.920 --> 20:38.600]  news organizations totally for the sake of the CIA have come out even mother
[20:38.600 --> 20:42.720]  Jones which is an opinion journal I mean they're not they offer their opinions
[20:42.720 --> 20:45.320]  out there in their leftist I said we're not gonna run with something like this
[20:45.320 --> 20:50.640]  there was a political reporter Alex who had been fired even from Politico as
[20:50.640 --> 20:55.000]  skewed as Politico is she was fired from Politico because she floated this
[20:55.000 --> 20:58.520]  story about Donald Trump allegedly having sex with his daughter and that's
[20:58.520 --> 21:02.880]  that come on that's way beyond the pale they fired her from Politico and even
[21:02.880 --> 21:06.840]  she said she would not run with this BuzzFeed story so you've got BuzzFeed
[21:06.840 --> 21:10.120]  you've got CNN that are coming out there and of course Jake Tapper who is
[21:10.120 --> 21:15.720]  basically just burned his reputation down like the former CBS News anchor
[21:15.720 --> 21:21.640]  Jim I'm losing his the one that sold the fake story about George W. Bush and the
[21:21.640 --> 21:25.560]  National Guard but anyway yeah Dan rather thank you
[21:25.560 --> 21:30.200]  it's even forgotten Dan rather I usually used to be a big name but they burn
[21:30.200 --> 21:34.000]  their reputations down and Jake Tapper is gonna go the way of Dan rather but
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.520]  Alex when Trump took the first question about this he said look I tell my people
[21:38.520 --> 21:41.880]  be very careful when you're traveling especially when you're going to foreign
[21:41.880 --> 21:45.560]  countries or a country like Russia he said they've got cameras everywhere so
[21:45.560 --> 21:50.600]  don't do anything that you don't want to have on camera and even before this
[21:50.600 --> 21:54.920]  happened in response to the previous fake news that they put out about Russian
[21:54.920 --> 22:00.120]  hacking he said to reporters don't trust computers computers are not safe if you
[22:00.120 --> 22:02.680]  got anything important you write it down on a piece of paper and you give it to a
[22:02.680 --> 22:07.040]  courier to have it hand-delivered so Donald Trump isn't an idiot you have to
[22:07.040 --> 22:10.400]  be an idiot to do what he did what they're accusing him of doing yeah
[22:10.400 --> 22:15.440]  Donald Trump until this year or I guess last year now didn't even have
[22:15.440 --> 22:21.480]  computers in his main office area and in and I'm gonna get into the details but
[22:21.480 --> 22:27.360]  reportedly leaves leaves phones out out in drawers out in a four-year area so in
[22:27.360 --> 22:32.000]  a way people say oh he's not high-tech and on a way he's so anti-tech he does
[22:32.000 --> 22:37.520]  exactly what real spies and people do is he compartmentalizes all the
[22:37.520 --> 22:41.200]  electronics and keeps them away from him and everything is done on paper which
[22:41.200 --> 22:45.000]  is actually what they wish presidents would really do so isn't it crazy that
[22:45.000 --> 22:49.320]  just instinctively Trump already operates the way a president should
[22:49.320 --> 22:53.960]  operate I mean they keep saying that he doesn't have the background or the pedigree
[22:53.960 --> 22:59.720]  or or the skill to be president as if some community organizer nobody that
[22:59.720 --> 23:03.480]  never did anything could run the country and go on vacation four months out of
[23:03.480 --> 23:08.160]  the year meanwhile Trump is a total workhorse who already is bringing back
[23:08.160 --> 23:13.200]  over a hundred million dollars worth of jobs Ford Chrysler the list goes on and
[23:13.200 --> 23:15.920]  on I mean I don't want to go into a whole diatribe about what how Trump's
[23:15.920 --> 23:19.120]  already being presidential how he's already helped the economy more than
[23:19.120 --> 23:23.120]  Obama did in eight years that's not hard to do because Obama was trying to
[23:23.120 --> 23:26.680]  consolidate the economy and only give money to his friends that's what
[23:26.680 --> 23:32.160]  globalism is is a giant consolidation system David now I know we're coming up
[23:32.160 --> 23:36.520]  on the break a little while I want to go ahead and start airing this press
[23:36.520 --> 23:41.320]  conference from the beginning with Spicer then with Pence then with Trump
[23:41.320 --> 23:46.040]  and David and I will intersperse during this hour but but just briefly David you
[23:46.040 --> 23:49.480]  don't just have McAfee joining you coming up tell us who else I've got
[23:49.480 --> 23:53.720]  Craig Richardson from E&E organization they're an energy and environment
[23:53.720 --> 23:58.440]  legal organization he's going to comment on Donald Trump's interior and energy
[23:58.440 --> 24:02.240]  picks as they were coming up this week and confirmation hearings they're very
[24:02.240 --> 24:05.800]  happy with what they see because these are people who have pushed for a free
[24:05.800 --> 24:09.640]  market who have pushed for America to be able to develop its energy resources
[24:09.640 --> 24:15.080]  because energy is not only a financial necessity but it actually affects not
[24:15.080 --> 24:18.080]  just the quality of your life but the duration of your life your life
[24:18.080 --> 24:20.680]  expectancy so that's a very important thing we look at these energy and
[24:20.680 --> 24:24.880]  interior picks let me add some to the press conference and then come back
[24:24.880 --> 24:29.560]  from break and play more for years when I would have people on exposing the fact
[24:29.560 --> 24:33.400]  of shutting off our coal plants was hurting our country I would get emails
[24:33.400 --> 24:37.480]  and letters and the media would say oh he must work for big coal or he must work
[24:37.480 --> 24:43.000]  for oil folks I don't get any money from that the point is is that energy is
[24:43.000 --> 24:48.040]  everything and if our energy is double or triple the price of China's no one
[24:48.040 --> 24:52.360]  will have industry here if we've unfairly from the beginning been penalized
[24:52.360 --> 24:57.320]  on the basis of everything energy I mean children understand this watching
[24:57.320 --> 25:02.800]  cartoons why are the Decepticons here on earth to drain the earth's core of its
[25:02.800 --> 25:07.480]  energy and create energy on cubes they have to have energy that's the food of
[25:07.480 --> 25:11.520]  an industrial society you know why don't all these other cultures dry up in the
[25:11.520 --> 25:15.360]  middle of the you know desert because it became a desert in North Africa people
[25:15.360 --> 25:18.880]  had to move out of there because there was no longer the energy of the plants of
[25:18.880 --> 25:23.720]  the fruit of the animals that lived off the plants and then humans eat the meat
[25:23.720 --> 25:27.320]  and get energy transferred through the plants through the water through the
[25:27.320 --> 25:32.640]  sunlight into the animal into the deer into the gazelle into the animal they're
[25:32.640 --> 25:37.200]  eating into us the humans everything is energy and I you know this seems really
[25:37.200 --> 25:41.680]  simple to us we have to remember they've dumbed down young people so much that
[25:41.680 --> 25:45.640]  many of them don't even understand these very very simple equations that's why
[25:45.640 --> 25:48.840]  sometimes it sounds like I'm talking to you like they're five years old I'm not
[25:48.840 --> 25:52.040]  talking to our general audience like that a lot of the public doesn't even
[25:52.040 --> 25:55.880]  really know where meat comes from at the grocery store or where electricity comes
[25:55.880 --> 26:01.080]  from so the fact that America and Europe have been penalized for 20 years on our
[26:01.080 --> 26:05.440]  energy production as part of globalism is the key to so much so I'm glad that
[26:05.440 --> 26:08.760]  David is going to be breaking some of that down let's go ahead and go to the
[26:08.760 --> 26:14.080]  start of the press conference and there he is the incoming White House press
[26:14.080 --> 26:17.720]  secretary let's listen in for the president elect make some remarks he
[26:17.720 --> 26:22.240]  will introduce Ms. Sherry Dylan a prominent attorney in Washington DC with
[26:22.240 --> 26:26.280]  the prestigious firm of Morgan Lewis who will who structured the agreements
[26:26.280 --> 26:29.760]  pursuant to the president business arrangements and she will give brief
[26:29.760 --> 26:34.320]  remarks before we start I want to bring your attention to a few points on the
[26:34.320 --> 26:38.760]  report that was published in BuzzFeed last night it's frankly outrageous and
[26:38.760 --> 26:43.200]  highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog that was openly hostile to the
[26:43.200 --> 26:48.240]  president-elect's campaign to drop highly salacious and flat-out false
[26:48.240 --> 26:53.280]  information on the internet just days before he takes the oath of office
[26:53.280 --> 26:58.440]  according to BuzzFeed's own editor there are some serious reasons to doubt the
[26:58.440 --> 27:03.240]  allegations in the report the executive editor of the New York Times also
[27:03.240 --> 27:09.000]  dismissed the report by saying it was quote totally unsubstantiated echoing
[27:09.000 --> 27:13.040]  the concerns that many other reporters expressed on the internet the fact that
[27:13.040 --> 27:18.360]  BuzzFeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a
[27:18.360 --> 27:24.040]  sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks the report is not an intelligence report
[27:24.040 --> 27:30.040]  plain and simple one issue that the report talked about was the relationship
[27:30.040 --> 27:34.920]  of three individuals associated with the campaign these three individuals Paul
[27:34.920 --> 27:39.760]  Manafort Michael Cohen and Carter Page Carter Page is an individual who the
[27:39.760 --> 27:44.920]  president-elect does not know and was put on notice months ago by the campaign
[27:44.920 --> 27:49.960]  Paul Manafort has adamantly denied any of this involvement and Michael Cohen
[27:49.960 --> 27:54.200]  who is said to have visited Prague in August and September did not leave or
[27:54.200 --> 27:59.120]  enter the United States during this time we asked him to produce his passport to
[27:59.120 --> 28:03.640]  confirm his whereabouts on the dates in question and there was no doubt that he
[28:03.640 --> 28:09.480]  was not in Prague in fact Mr. Cohen has never been in Prague a new report
[28:09.480 --> 28:14.080]  actually suggests that Michael Cohen was at the at the University of Southern
[28:14.080 --> 28:19.160]  California with his son at a baseball game one report now suggested
[28:19.160 --> 28:24.160]  apparently it's another Michael Cohen for all the talk lately about fake news
[28:24.160 --> 28:28.440]  this political witch hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most
[28:28.440 --> 28:34.320]  flimsy reporting and it's frankly shameful and disgraceful with that it is
[28:34.320 --> 28:38.160]  my honor to introduce the next vice president of the United States Mike
[28:38.160 --> 28:53.920]  Pence we are nine days away from the inauguration of the 45th president of
[28:53.920 --> 29:05.120]  the United States of America I am profoundly honored and humbled that I
[29:05.120 --> 29:09.440]  will take the oath of office to serve as vice president of the United States
[29:09.440 --> 29:15.320]  nine days from today but I'm even more honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with
[29:15.320 --> 29:25.440]  a new president who will make America great again now the president elects
[29:25.440 --> 29:30.320]  leadership and his energy during the campaign was impressive but as the
[29:30.320 --> 29:34.880]  chairman of the transition effort I can assure the American people that his
[29:34.880 --> 29:39.840]  energy and his vision during the course of this transition has been even more
[29:39.840 --> 29:43.840]  inspiring to see the way he has brought together man that's the beginning of the
[29:43.840 --> 29:47.040]  press conference we're going to have some specific clips for you when we come
[29:47.040 --> 29:51.080]  back we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back the empires on
[29:51.080 --> 30:01.360]  the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network just where to CNN find their
[30:01.360 --> 30:05.120]  news sources if you recall they first suggested that the Russians hack the
[30:05.120 --> 30:08.960]  election to help get Donald Trump elected and yesterday they're reporting now
[30:08.960 --> 30:12.840]  that Intel chiefs are presenting Trump with claims of Russian efforts to
[30:12.840 --> 30:16.800]  compromise him what they're insinuating directly quoting here from their website
[30:16.800 --> 30:20.800]  classified documents presented last week the president Obama and president
[30:20.800 --> 30:24.120]  elect Trump included allegations the Russian operatives claimed to have
[30:24.120 --> 30:28.200]  compromising personal and financial information about Trump this of course
[30:28.200 --> 30:32.160]  is coming from quote multiple US officials with direct knowledge on the
[30:32.160 --> 30:36.000]  briefings oh really what they're insinuating is that the Russians have
[30:36.000 --> 30:40.760]  finance secrets and sexual deviant secrets about Trump that could be used to
[30:40.760 --> 30:44.360]  blackmail him they're also claiming that one reason the nation's intelligence
[30:44.360 --> 30:48.080]  chiefs took an extraordinary step of including the synopsis in the briefing
[30:48.080 --> 30:52.320]  of documents was to make Donald Trump aware that such allegations involving him

[33:13.040 --> 33:18.960]  ladies and gentlemen we are only nine days out from president 45 being
[33:18.960 --> 33:23.320]  inaugurated David Knight is hosting the broadcast I am joining you from the road
[33:23.320 --> 33:27.200]  taking some very important time off with the family but I've got to tell you I've
[33:27.200 --> 33:31.600]  still been working about I don't know about five six hours a day just dealing
[33:31.600 --> 33:35.640]  with administrative things and also trying to stay up to date on the news
[33:35.640 --> 33:42.640]  information I've also been on the phone talking to folks high up in the
[33:42.640 --> 33:46.520]  resistance I'll just leave it at that and I'll tell you that is the big
[33:46.520 --> 33:50.520]  difference here isn't it just what Pence was just talking about for the press
[33:50.520 --> 33:57.720]  conference earlier the vice president Donald Trump is on the job 18 to 20
[33:57.720 --> 34:03.920]  hours a day and Donald Trump he's paying attention to the constituents and the
[34:03.920 --> 34:08.760]  American people it is unbelievable how good he is my gut said go with Trump and
[34:08.760 --> 34:12.960]  I cannot believe how right it was he is such a godsend I don't want to sit here
[34:12.960 --> 34:18.240]  and gush over this anymore but notice how all he's doing is delivering and he's
[34:18.240 --> 34:21.600]  putting in a few people that have been in Goldman Sachs galaxy even banning who
[34:21.600 --> 34:25.720]  then left Goldman Sachs expose the whole thing I mean Goldman Sachs is king it
[34:25.720 --> 34:28.760]  runs everything of course if you've got top people they're going to come from
[34:28.760 --> 34:34.800]  there but but the point is is that he's he's reversing their whole program they
[34:34.800 --> 34:38.040]  are completely panicking right now they are so scared so I'm going to go back
[34:38.040 --> 34:41.080]  to David Knight and more the press conference we've got some excise pieces
[34:41.080 --> 34:44.720]  that will be ready towards the end of the hour and then of course when
[34:44.720 --> 34:48.560]  McAfee's on more clips coming up the next hour with a perfect guess to the
[34:48.560 --> 34:52.400]  David got on McAfee to break down the hacking to break down the latest stuff
[34:52.400 --> 34:56.840]  but listen getting back to what David was just talking about and I heard a
[34:56.840 --> 35:00.960]  Margaret Howell report during the break that was excellent this is what they
[35:00.960 --> 35:05.240]  claim that Trump is blackmailed by the Russians with no evidence when Hillary
[35:05.240 --> 35:09.560]  for years had a secret server in her bathroom that they know at least six
[35:09.560 --> 35:14.000]  foreign governments were accessing she was using it as a drop box I was told
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.240]  this a year ago by high-level sources and then also some of them came on the
[35:18.240 --> 35:25.400]  show okay and then publicly said the word is she has plausible immobility is
[35:25.400 --> 35:32.360]  still totally illegal to put the server out that's wireless that's open and then
[35:32.360 --> 35:38.920]  to let the world know they could come and get on it and then basically use the
[35:38.920 --> 35:43.600]  information however they wanted to but for her to put it on the server they
[35:43.600 --> 35:47.920]  had to then put money in her foundation and that's why hundreds of countries
[35:47.920 --> 35:53.040]  were putting money into her foundation was because it was a giant payoff off
[35:53.040 --> 35:57.360]  now now we already know that it's in the emails and those are the emails she
[35:57.360 --> 36:03.000]  didn't delete imagine the 30 plus thousand emails that were deleted
[36:03.000 --> 36:07.640]  imagine what's in those ladies and gentlemen it's everything under the
[36:07.640 --> 36:13.240]  Sun this is a true criminal enterprise and just like a prison is going to be
[36:13.240 --> 36:17.920]  full of different types of criminals a lesion of doom Hillary's whole entourage
[36:17.920 --> 36:23.400]  and the group she runs with runs from bad to worse to absolutely pure evil so
[36:23.400 --> 36:27.520]  that's why it's so over-the-top and that's why good people have a blind spot
[36:27.520 --> 36:33.160]  I never get sick of sunsets I never get sick of a good ribeye steak I never get
[36:33.160 --> 36:37.920]  sick of a cold beer I never get sick of a nice high-cup of mountainside I never
[36:37.920 --> 36:41.520]  get sick of loving my family and hugging my children and just being a good
[36:41.520 --> 36:47.360]  person well see we're normal okay we're not perfect in fact we have guilt
[36:47.360 --> 36:51.720]  because we're good people we have a conscience they don't and so we're
[36:51.720 --> 36:56.120]  blinded to the enemy that's why we have to force ourselves to study history
[36:56.120 --> 37:00.160]  because these evil people show up throughout history and build the same
[37:00.160 --> 37:04.320]  type of corrupt empires than the same type of systems so when they accuse
[37:04.320 --> 37:11.360]  Trump with a zero not a zip evidence of being compromised by the Russians with
[37:11.360 --> 37:17.200]  no proof their proof is Exxon mobile did some oil drilling in the North Sea well
[37:17.200 --> 37:20.960]  they better everybody else does of course Russia has the most oil of
[37:20.960 --> 37:25.880]  anybody in the world the United States is second Saudi Arabia's third I mean
[37:25.880 --> 37:30.400]  Exxon mobile better be drilling their own with a horrible person bringing free
[37:30.400 --> 37:35.760]  market capitalism to Russia that's their evidence that's their evidence meanwhile
[37:35.760 --> 37:40.320]  Hillary 35 million free uranium with Russians on and on and on secretly
[37:40.320 --> 37:44.160]  meeting with Putin remember that came out about two months before the election
[37:44.160 --> 37:50.200]  that she secretly met with Putin on at least two occasions Hillary almost said
[37:50.200 --> 37:57.800]  that again secretly met with Putin secretly met with Putin secretly met
[37:57.800 --> 38:02.960]  with Putin there you go did Donald Trump ever meet Putin no to be secretly
[38:02.960 --> 38:08.040]  with Putin no the point is we know fraud when we see it so now they put out
[38:08.040 --> 38:14.280]  this fake dossier that it turns out was floating around the Internet for weeks
[38:14.280 --> 38:19.640]  if not months and that the CIA was passing it around wondering if it was
[38:19.640 --> 38:24.960]  real let me explain something folks the CIA people that fly into war torn
[38:24.960 --> 38:28.280]  regions and the people that actually do stuff in the field are a very small
[38:28.280 --> 38:33.520]  percentage of the CIA now or they call it teeth to tail basically previously
[38:33.520 --> 38:37.320]  with the CIA you might have one or two people in support of someone in the
[38:37.320 --> 38:43.200]  field now you might have 20 people in support of one person in the field they've
[38:43.200 --> 38:48.280]  gone completely away and of course the military it's like one to twelve right
[38:48.280 --> 38:53.120]  now they've gotten away from what they call humid and they've owned the
[38:53.120 --> 38:58.240]  computers and digital this and digital that a bunch of spying all the CIA is is
[38:58.240 --> 39:05.680]  a bunch of Ivy League nerds okay who got beat up in high school to have pocket
[39:05.680 --> 39:08.800]  protectors about St. Parker protectors are bad or the nerds are better to sing
[39:08.800 --> 39:13.240]  these are nerds that want to be tough guys okay on average and they're liberals
[39:13.240 --> 39:16.760]  on average and they're in there acting tough and acting like they're tough guys
[39:16.760 --> 39:20.360]  and acting like their spies when it's the military and the people that are
[39:20.360 --> 39:25.040]  doing all the killing all the humid all on the ground stuff the CIA sits there
[39:25.040 --> 39:28.320]  and basically runs around making deals with the Saudi Arabians and getting
[39:28.320 --> 39:32.440]  paid off they're a big group of compromised paid-off globalist that
[39:32.440 --> 39:36.080]  have sold this country out who've had diplomatic immunity who've been above
[39:36.080 --> 39:41.280]  the law since 1947 and let me tell you the CIA was bad in 1947 because you
[39:41.280 --> 39:44.760]  should never give some group above the law anonymity and all this power but
[39:44.760 --> 39:51.560]  imagine what it's like now in 2017 it is an anti-American excess pit now does
[39:51.560 --> 39:55.600]  that mean everybody in the CIA is bad absolutely not there was a time when the
[39:55.600 --> 40:02.720]  CIA was still recruiting you know basically the football captain okay there
[40:02.720 --> 40:07.080]  was a time where you'd have a square jaw and you had to be in combat for four
[40:07.080 --> 40:11.080]  or five years and you had to you know always take your orders and then get
[40:11.080 --> 40:14.560]  tears in your eyes when the Star Spangled Banner got played and all the rest of
[40:14.560 --> 40:18.560]  before you got the CIA it hasn't been that way in 20 years ladies and gentlemen
[40:18.560 --> 40:22.200]  okay in fact they don't want square jaw people in there now what they want is a
[40:22.200 --> 40:25.800]  bunch of wimps and a bunch of politicos and a bunch of cowards okay I'm here to
[40:25.800 --> 40:30.320]  tell you right now it's a joke and all they do is they run around with a bunch
[40:30.320 --> 40:34.000]  of disinformation they run around with a bunch of garbage they run around with a
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.560]  bunch of social engineering approving Hollywood scripts I mean that and
[40:38.560 --> 40:44.000]  and propagandizing and just playing god over the American people and because
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  they're not real men and because a lot of our women that also have it out for
[40:48.000 --> 40:51.900]  men and this is all very anti-male situation folks because they're anti-
[40:51.900 --> 40:55.800]  strength they're anti-individualism they're anti a threat that could ever
[40:55.800 --> 40:59.600]  rise up against them like it's happening now so their whole system is about
[40:59.600 --> 41:04.200]  weakening America because instinctively they hate strength so you
[41:04.200 --> 41:08.920]  understand the enemy psychology it's a foreign banking cartel that through
[41:08.920 --> 41:13.320]  Pratt House in 1921 set up a British intelligence arm that through OSS and the
[41:13.320 --> 41:19.240]  CIA had basically a foreign global corporate takeover of America now that's
[41:19.240 --> 41:23.240]  coming to an end they are openly trying to claim that Trump is blackmailed or
[41:23.240 --> 41:26.880]  the Trump is an outsider when they are the ones that are outsiders and they are
[41:26.880 --> 41:31.160]  the ones that are using blackmail to take down and control this country they
[41:31.160 --> 41:34.800]  also understand their own white papers like from the Clinton Foundation that is
[41:34.800 --> 41:39.800]  the Clinton Library Foundation in Little Rock but if we ever produce our own
[41:39.800 --> 41:44.040]  economy in America our own economy of ideas and our own economy of selling
[41:44.040 --> 41:48.680]  books and videos which they feared 25 years ago it would be game over for them
[41:48.680 --> 41:53.320]  that's why it's more as essential than ever for you to support the broadcast and
[41:53.320 --> 41:56.240]  I want to thank you all for doing it because you are the people that built
[41:56.240 --> 42:00.320]  this info or you are the folks who made it all possible and that's why before we
[42:00.320 --> 42:03.920]  go back to David Knight of the press conference and James McAfee and everybody
[42:03.920 --> 42:09.720]  else our job magazine is coming up DNA force is 10% off right now that has been
[42:09.720 --> 42:16.720]  out for I guess about two months that's our amazing bio PQQ CoQ 10 formula the
[42:16.720 --> 42:20.920]  very best out there and that's 10% off at infowarstore.com

[42:31.280 --> 42:37.200]  have been sold out for months are back in stock at infowarslife.com also
[42:37.200 --> 42:45.280]  White House Globalist Run Soros funded media matters came out and demonized
[42:45.280 --> 42:49.040]  info wars and David Knight by name if I wanted to get David to take on us in a
[42:49.040 --> 42:53.880]  moment for daring during the latest Islamic attack in Fort Lauderdale last
[42:53.880 --> 42:58.280]  week to say see that's why we're selling body armor inserts for backpacks that
[42:58.280 --> 43:02.080]  are nanotech only folks that have this that's why we're selling these vest
[43:02.080 --> 43:07.440]  systems that are less than the than the steel plate stuff and wait five times
[43:07.440 --> 43:12.280]  less on average back some of the ways even less depending on the system and
[43:12.280 --> 43:16.200]  then they acted like we were bad saying that that's like saying wear shoes so
[43:16.200 --> 43:20.480]  you don't step on thorns and then and then you're exploiting people saying
[43:20.480 --> 43:23.880]  don't step on thorns or brush your teeth you're exploiting people saying
[43:23.880 --> 43:27.960]  don't get cavities I mean of course we're selling body armor so that when
[43:27.960 --> 43:31.840]  there's a shooting or a crisis people have more protection that's like saying
[43:31.840 --> 43:36.880]  police shouldn't wear body armor or saying cops should have body armor is
[43:36.880 --> 43:41.040]  is exploiting the police but again this is the upside down world of these
[43:41.040 --> 43:45.760]  people as they try to demonize us simply trying to fund ourselves and if
[43:45.760 --> 43:49.640]  people hear the energy in my voice yes I've had one cup of coffee but why do I
[43:49.640 --> 43:54.000]  have so much energy because epic history is happening now and they want our
[43:54.000 --> 43:58.680]  energy low they want us weak they want us defeated and the end of that system of
[43:58.680 --> 44:01.960]  defeat is now coming to a head David I want to get back to the press conference
[44:01.960 --> 44:05.000]  the next service you've got in the next hour but just getting into that whole
[44:05.000 --> 44:10.240]  area I don't even know how to describe the logic of where they demonize us for
[44:10.240 --> 44:15.320]  selling high quality exclusive nano tech nano tube body armor already selling it
[44:15.320 --> 44:19.080]  when there's a mass shooting that's evidence of why you need the body armor
[44:19.080 --> 44:23.920]  that's not exploitation but again they're inverting logic on purpose to
[44:23.920 --> 44:28.560]  try to deprogram people away from normal logic that were programmed genetically
[44:28.560 --> 44:33.480]  with to just be malfunctioning idiots I mean you say to a Michael Moore has six
[44:33.480 --> 44:37.280]  bodyguards with guns but says that I shouldn't be able to have a gun to
[44:37.280 --> 44:40.800]  protect myself if I'm just a middle-class person or a poor person or a working
[44:40.800 --> 44:44.480]  class person where's the logic and they just laugh at you because they're at
[44:44.480 --> 44:48.560]  war with logic David I mean how do you break down this cosmology well I didn't
[44:48.560 --> 44:52.480]  even know they attacked me Alex I think it's kind of humorous actually are they
[44:52.480 --> 44:56.920]  gonna attack us for selling water filters you know because of what happened in
[44:56.920 --> 45:00.160]  Flint, Michigan I mean we're selling water filters a long time before that but
[45:00.160 --> 45:03.440]  you know you really do need water filters to protect yourself and Flint,
[45:03.440 --> 45:07.600]  Michigan is something that the Democrats went into very heavily from a political
[45:07.600 --> 45:11.200]  standpoint they politicized that tried to make it all about the Republicans or
[45:11.200 --> 45:15.240]  whatever look it's about pure water and we've got Republicans and Democrats that
[45:15.240 --> 45:19.040]  are dumping garbage on us not just on the news media but they're dumping
[45:19.040 --> 45:23.040]  garbage into our water so we saw well water filters is the same thing we talked
[45:23.040 --> 45:27.400]  to people about getting some protection for them and you know you couldn't put
[45:27.400 --> 45:30.800]  the kind of body armor that used to be around with the heavy metal plates you
[45:30.800 --> 45:34.040]  couldn't put that in your kids backpack and have them walk around so they can
[45:34.040 --> 45:37.960]  have some protection and a gun-free zone where they're not gonna let any adults
[45:37.960 --> 45:42.320]  have guns to protect the children but now you can you got something this
[45:42.320 --> 45:45.640]  lightweight with this nanotube technology so the kids could carry that in
[45:45.640 --> 45:49.120]  their backpack it's an important thing to know David I've been struggling to
[45:49.120 --> 45:53.560]  think of an analogy that was proper and you just did it think about this almost
[45:53.560 --> 45:58.400]  every state has high levels of weed killer roundup glyphosate that they
[45:58.400 --> 46:03.160]  admit causes breast cancer, testicular cancer, prostate cancer, you name it I
[46:03.160 --> 46:07.280]  mean it's admitted almost every woman I run into about 40 has had breast
[46:07.280 --> 46:11.280]  cancer I mean it is just devastating my own family I'm so angry about it well
[46:11.280 --> 46:14.080]  what do I do for my daughters and you bet I went on found the best water
[46:14.080 --> 46:17.280]  filters I've got four or five companies that you know that all have similar
[46:17.280 --> 46:21.200]  specs and and yes we found our operations selling water filters you've
[46:21.200 --> 46:25.560]  almost every state has high levels of glyphosate in the tap water in the well
[46:25.560 --> 46:30.320]  water is it exploited to say get a high quality water filtration system that
[46:30.320 --> 46:35.080]  totally cuts it out and hundreds of other bio bad things like fluoride then
[46:35.080 --> 46:38.800]  that helps you that helps us he drives down medical bills and that way your
[46:38.800 --> 46:42.000]  daughter or your mother aren't having their breasts removed with a mastectomy
[46:42.000 --> 46:47.480]  again again to them it's exploitative that we're actually trying to give
[46:47.480 --> 46:52.880]  people a solution to mitigate the toxins that are yet the base level of our
[46:52.880 --> 46:58.760]  biology in our food chain water it's exactly it's like saying it's like
[46:58.760 --> 47:02.800]  saying oh breast cancer is way up from glyphosate in the water table and I
[47:02.800 --> 47:06.520]  choose her down from fluoride so Jones sells water filters that cut it out how
[47:06.520 --> 47:10.760]  exploitive is that yeah you know when when they talked about it they made it
[47:10.760 --> 47:15.080]  simply about lead they made it simply about Republicans but of course they
[47:15.080 --> 47:19.960]  dump fluoride in which has the same effect as lead does on IQ and there's a
[47:19.960 --> 47:22.520]  lot of other things you point out glyphosate even if you're not on a city
[47:22.520 --> 47:26.240]  water supply even if you got your own well out in the rural areas you may be
[47:26.240 --> 47:29.920]  even more likely to get the glyphosate in there because there may be somebody
[47:29.920 --> 47:34.920]  that is using it on their nearby farm and it's going to get down into the
[47:34.920 --> 47:39.600]  water supply and that way so people need to be aware that they can do certain
[47:39.600 --> 47:43.120]  things and they're not going to be able to constant constantly test their water
[47:43.120 --> 47:45.600]  to see what's in it and that's what they don't want they don't want to take
[47:45.600 --> 47:48.960]  control of our lives they don't want us getting in power they don't want us
[47:48.960 --> 47:52.080]  realizing hey the big cities are dangerous falling apart we need to move
[47:52.080 --> 47:55.280]  to rural areas in fact they admit that the president the outgoing president
[47:55.280 --> 47:59.880]  admits they want zoning controls so people can't flee to the countryside they
[47:59.880 --> 48:03.280]  want to have taxes and regulations to keep us from being self-sufficient
[48:03.280 --> 48:07.200]  everything they do is about not letting us have our own media not letting us have
[48:07.200 --> 48:10.640]  our own schools not letting us have our own food not letting us have our own
[48:10.640 --> 48:14.080]  protection not letting us have our own transportation not letting us have our
[48:14.080 --> 48:17.760]  own courts our own local sovereignty everything is about removing our local
[48:17.760 --> 48:22.680]  control and transferring it to centralized global systems just like we saw
[48:22.680 --> 48:28.680]  in 1775 if you read the Declaration of Independence from July 4th David you know
[48:28.680 --> 48:31.720]  Alex go ahead and start going back to the press conference from the time that
[48:31.720 --> 48:35.960]  Pence was about to interview introduce Trump and I know we're gonna have a
[48:35.960 --> 48:39.320]  bunch of excerpts for you guys that are already ready again the next hour but
[48:39.320 --> 48:43.720]  here's a few more minutes of him introducing Trump earlier today
[48:49.960 --> 48:53.840]  I think we don't have do we have the audio this the hearings already scheduled
[48:53.840 --> 48:58.640]  seven more soon to go on the books in the next several days and it is it is a
[48:58.640 --> 49:04.880]  compilation of men and women with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and
[49:04.880 --> 49:10.080]  background to help this administration move our nation forward perhaps that's
[49:10.080 --> 49:14.360]  why there's been such a concerted effort by some in the ministry needed to
[49:14.360 --> 49:19.720]  delegitimize this election and to demean our incoming administration you know I
[49:19.720 --> 49:23.600]  have long been a supporter of a free and independent press and I always will be
[49:23.600 --> 49:30.640]  but with freedom comes responsibility and the irresponsible decision of a few
[49:30.640 --> 49:35.840]  news organizations to run with a false and unsubstantiated report when most
[49:35.840 --> 49:41.000]  news organizations resisted the temptation to propagate this fake news
[49:41.000 --> 49:46.600]  can only be attributed to media bias and attempt to demean the president-elect
[49:46.600 --> 49:53.320]  and our incoming administration and the American people are sick and tired of it
[49:53.320 --> 50:04.840]  but today we'll get back to real news to real facts and the real progress our
[50:04.840 --> 50:10.080]  incoming president has already made in reviving the American economy and
[50:10.080 --> 50:15.760]  assembling a team that will make America great again so and we'll hear from the
[50:15.760 --> 50:19.440]  president-elect about issues that are of paramount importance to the American
[50:19.440 --> 50:26.000]  people today so it is my honor to introduce to all of you my friend and
[50:26.000 --> 50:40.120]  the president-elect of the United States of America Donald Trump thank you very
[50:40.120 --> 50:43.920]  much it's very familiar territory news conferences because we used to give them
[50:43.920 --> 50:49.560]  on a almost daily basis I think we probably maybe won the nomination because
[50:49.560 --> 50:55.200]  of news conferences and it's good to be with you we stopped giving them because
[50:55.200 --> 51:00.040]  we're getting quite a bit of inaccurate news but I do have to say that and I
[51:00.040 --> 51:05.560]  must say that I want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today
[51:05.560 --> 51:14.240]  because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence
[51:14.240 --> 51:19.480]  agencies who knows but maybe the intelligence agencies which would be a
[51:19.480 --> 51:25.360]  tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that a tremendous plot
[51:25.360 --> 51:30.520]  because a thing like that should have never been written it should never been
[51:30.520 --> 51:35.160]  had and it should certainly never have been released but I want to thank a lot
[51:35.160 --> 51:40.320]  of the news organizations for some of whom have not treated me very well over
[51:40.320 --> 51:46.520]  the years a couple in particular and they came out so strongly against that
[51:46.520 --> 51:53.400]  fake news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and
[51:53.400 --> 51:58.840]  one television station so I just want to compliment many of the people in the
[51:58.840 --> 52:03.160]  room I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the
[52:03.160 --> 52:08.480]  press and all of that but I will tell you there were some news organizations
[52:08.480 --> 52:14.640]  with all that was just said that were so professional so incredibly
[52:14.640 --> 52:20.920]  professional that I've just gone up a notch as to what I think of you okay
[52:20.920 --> 52:28.480]  news over the last couple of weeks I've been quite active I guess you could say
[52:28.480 --> 52:33.120]  in an economic way for the country a lot of car companies are going to be
[52:33.120 --> 52:36.000]  moving in we have other companies big news is going to be announced over the
[52:36.000 --> 52:40.400]  next couple of weeks about companies that are going to be building in the Midwest
[52:40.400 --> 52:45.800]  you saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler big big factory going to be built in this
[52:45.800 --> 52:49.560]  country as opposed to another country Ford just announced that they stopped
[52:49.560 --> 52:54.880]  plans for a billion dollar plant in Mexico and they're going to be moving
[52:54.880 --> 52:59.760]  into Michigan and expanding very substantially a an existing plan folks
[52:59.760 --> 53:03.560]  there's been artificial controls here I appreciate it from having jobs is
[53:03.560 --> 53:09.960]  removing them I hope that General Motors will be following and I think they
[53:09.960 --> 53:13.000]  will be I think a lot of people will be following I think a lot of industries
[53:13.000 --> 53:17.000]  are going to be coming back we have to get our drug industry coming back our
[53:17.000 --> 53:20.640]  drug industry has been disaster I love how we mail out General Motors and it
[53:20.640 --> 53:25.040]  leaves they supply our drugs but they don't make them here to a large extent
[53:25.040 --> 53:29.760]  and the other 90% are making shine on bidding procedures for the drug
[53:29.760 --> 53:33.040]  industry because they're getting away with murder
[53:33.040 --> 53:38.320]  pharma pharma has a lot of lobbies a lot of lobbyists a lot of power and
[53:38.320 --> 53:44.040]  there's very little bidding on drugs with the largest buyer of drugs in the
[53:44.040 --> 53:48.080]  way that he's going after big pharma we're going to start bidding and we're
[53:48.080 --> 53:52.560]  going to save billions of dollars over a period of time and we're going to do
[53:52.560 --> 53:57.720]  that with a lot of other industries I'm very much involved with the generals
[53:57.720 --> 54:04.040]  and admirals on the airplane the F-35 you've been reading about it and it's
[54:04.040 --> 54:09.320]  way way behind schedule and many many billions of dollars over budget that's
[54:09.320 --> 54:14.200]  brilliant I don't like that and the admirals have been fantastic the generals
[54:14.200 --> 54:18.280]  have been fantastic I've really gotten to know them well and we're going to do
[54:18.280 --> 54:25.720]  some big things on the F-35 program and perhaps the F-18 program and we're going
[54:25.720 --> 54:29.960]  to get those costs way down and we're going to get the plane to be even better
[54:29.960 --> 54:34.760]  and we're going to have some competition and it's going to be a beautiful thing so
[54:34.760 --> 54:41.120]  we've been very very much involved and other things we had Jack Ma we had so
[54:41.120 --> 54:47.280]  many incredible people coming here to our know they're going to do tremendous
[54:47.280 --> 54:52.720]  things tremendous things in this country and they're very excited and I will say
[54:52.720 --> 54:55.680]  if the election didn't turn out the way it turned out they would not be here
[54:55.680 --> 54:59.360]  they would not be in my office they would not be in anybody else's office they'd
[54:59.360 --> 55:02.240]  be building and doing things in other countries let's go ahead and fade this
[55:02.240 --> 55:08.200]  down for now I'm going to come back to that in just a moment you're cruising a
[55:08.200 --> 55:10.720]  great job we had a computer hiccup playing earlier sorry about that debt
[55:10.720 --> 55:13.440]  air folks going back to David Knight we're going to come back in the next
[55:13.440 --> 55:17.800]  segment play some more of this and then go to McAfee who's joining us I mean just
[55:17.800 --> 55:21.920]  to think about how huge that was David the first thing he brings up is oh looks
[55:21.920 --> 55:24.960]  like it might have been some intelligence agencies released this well of
[55:24.960 --> 55:29.280]  course they did or CNN wouldn't have run with it believing they had the proof of
[55:29.280 --> 55:33.840]  blackmail I mean that just shows how reckless these groups are inside the
[55:33.840 --> 55:39.160]  CIA but it's the oldest it's the worst it's the most corrupt it's the biggest
[55:39.160 --> 55:44.640]  I mean it's it's it's the big spoiled baby yeah you know Alex from the very
[55:44.640 --> 55:47.720]  beginning John McCain's name was linked with this and when I first saw the very
[55:47.720 --> 55:50.920]  first report I saw on this he was linked with it and I said mmm I smell a rat
[55:50.920 --> 55:54.880]  well the smelliest rats in Washington is John McCain and now he's bragging about
[55:54.880 --> 55:58.920]  yeah I released that information as New York Times and others pointed out this
[55:58.920 --> 56:03.520]  is old information except for perhaps the troll that was put the trolling part
[56:03.520 --> 56:08.280]  that was put in by people at 4chan the rest of this is old information that's
[56:08.280 --> 56:11.480]  been circulating for a very long time New York Times said we looked at that
[56:11.480 --> 56:14.880]  we're not going to put that out they were totally unmanned substantiated said
[56:14.880 --> 56:18.920]  the New York Times executive editor of the USA Today investigative journalist
[56:18.920 --> 56:23.120]  said this is not how journalism works here's a thing that might or not might
[56:23.120 --> 56:26.680]  not be true we don't have any supporting evidence decide for yourself if it's
[56:26.680 --> 56:31.840]  legit that's the way he characterized it and even Mother Jones Alex said even
[56:31.840 --> 56:35.800]  Donald Trump deserves journalistic fairness and they are no fan of Donald
[56:35.800 --> 56:39.240]  Trump but they were not going to put out lies because they want to preserve their
[56:39.240 --> 56:43.680]  reputation here there's a bunch of people named in there who clearly were in
[56:43.680 --> 56:47.760]  other countries at the time it's already been proven to the media so they
[56:47.760 --> 56:51.000]  were hoping it was real they know they've lost so much credibility they
[56:51.000 --> 56:55.200]  want to try to censor us so they want to be the big high and mighty groups that
[56:55.200 --> 56:59.000]  you know protect Donald Trump I mean the truth is they're just as discredited as
[56:59.000 --> 57:05.640]  CNN the Washington Post is probably even worse you know then CNN or Buzzfeed
[57:05.640 --> 57:08.320]  but let's get the facts straight here okay and we should probably follow a
[57:08.320 --> 57:12.840]  special report today just showing the history of this it's the Clintons and
[57:12.840 --> 57:16.440]  the Democrats are flying around with Terry Epstein on the on the pedophile
[57:16.440 --> 57:21.440]  plane and flying to these Sheik's houses you know the openly keyful kids these
[57:21.440 --> 57:26.480]  are the people that have been compromised by foreign powers these are the
[57:26.480 --> 57:31.000]  people that are clearly being blackmailed these are the people that have
[57:31.000 --> 57:37.200]  this big long sordid history of being connected all of us so so let's not any
[57:37.200 --> 57:43.120]  of us forget that and let's not forget that the MSM is so arrogant that they
[57:43.120 --> 57:46.760]  act like there's no evidence of sickening stuff going on in the
[57:46.760 --> 57:52.200]  Podesta emails well okay well what's going on with Merrill Streak standing up
[57:52.200 --> 57:55.880]  a standing ovation for Roman Polanski and what's Hollywood doing trying to get
[57:55.880 --> 58:00.680]  his his rape of a 13-year-old girl overturned they're so public about this
[58:00.680 --> 58:05.360]  there's it's so ingrained it's it's it's so top-heavy with pedophiles in
[58:05.360 --> 58:10.640]  Hollywood and in DC that they openly openly are trying to get Roman
[58:10.640 --> 58:15.760]  Polanski's convictions overturned that shows how sick these people are so so
[58:15.760 --> 58:20.280]  they brought this out knowing it's pure bull knowing its lies remember
[58:20.280 --> 58:24.720]  remember the three lawsuits with Jane Doe's saying that Trump had raped them
[58:24.720 --> 58:28.720]  when they were little girls you know with teenagers totally made up and all of
[58:28.720 --> 58:31.720]  them got dropped and all of them got thrown out because all of them were
[58:31.720 --> 58:35.160]  completely made up and the people wouldn't even show up and claim it or
[58:35.160 --> 58:40.360]  say it they were completely fake lawsuits filed and I've been threatened by
[58:40.360 --> 58:43.320]  globalists that if I don't watch it they'll file some fake stuff on me go
[58:43.320 --> 58:45.840]  ahead throw me in the bar patch and that's the other thing I was going to
[58:45.840 --> 58:52.840]  mention David we're selling a product DNA force that is the very best
[58:52.840 --> 58:57.640]  nutraceutical that we can produce about a group you took years for you to develop
[58:57.640 --> 59:01.440]  DNA force for us it's been something that I've been working on for a long time
[59:01.440 --> 59:06.080]  Alex because I think it's very very important what the aging process is is
[59:06.080 --> 59:11.480]  when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of our telomeres telomeres are
[59:11.480 --> 59:14.800]  the little cups on the end of our chromosomes but when it runs out you
[59:14.800 --> 59:19.520]  start dying we chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials
[59:19.520 --> 59:23.440]  it's one of the most effective substances in the world it works like an
[59:23.440 --> 59:28.840]  antioxidant it works to repair nerve growth factor so this is a formula to
[59:28.840 --> 59:33.600]  deliver the maximum amount it's in powder form we have so many five star
[59:33.600 --> 59:37.560]  reviews I take this this is this is the product that I take info wars life
[59:37.560 --> 59:41.400]  comms and the profit we make we fight the global if we fight the new world order
[59:41.400 --> 59:46.320]  secure your DNA force today at info wars life comms are called toll free 888
[59:46.320 --> 59:55.760]  two five three three one three nine you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:55.760 --> 1:00:20.080]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[1:00:20.080 --> 1:00:24.560]  okay David nice house thing I'm in the file one more special report letter in
[1:00:24.560 --> 1:00:29.680]  the broadcast the crew's got a bunch of excerpts of the Trump's two-hour plus
[1:00:29.680 --> 1:00:35.280]  press conference coming up interspersed in this hour and the next hour John
[1:00:35.280 --> 1:00:38.520]  McAfee's going to be on the broadcast coming on the next segment and a lot
[1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:44.680]  more but as I went to break I was starting to the point that as soon as I
[1:00:44.680 --> 1:00:48.800]  hang up here I'm going to get on the phone and start making some calls to my
[1:00:48.800 --> 1:00:53.280]  contacts about when I'm allowed to break some really big news and this is the
[1:00:53.280 --> 1:00:56.720]  type of news that has me up at night okay and let me tell you something there
[1:00:56.720 --> 1:01:01.280]  isn't much that keeps me up at night okay I sleep like like a dead king I sleep
[1:01:01.280 --> 1:01:04.240]  like somebody under you know you know under a pyramid or something I mean I
[1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:10.080]  and I have been absolutely waking up over this because because this is so
[1:01:10.080 --> 1:01:14.160]  hardcore it's so serious and it goes to this whole climate of attacking the
[1:01:14.160 --> 1:01:18.360]  press this whole climate of persecution let me tell you the death
[1:01:18.360 --> 1:01:21.680]  throws of the globalist and they're far from dead but I'm saying the death
[1:01:21.680 --> 1:01:27.760]  rows of their current plan the death rows of them being so confident is very
[1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:32.880]  very spectacular and very very very very dangerous David Knight what are some
[1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:36.320]  of the topics you're going to be bringing up with mr. McAfee well Alex we're
[1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:39.920]  going to talk to him about why he has gone on record saying that he doesn't
[1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:44.920]  believe that this intelligence report has any validity whatsoever he's got very
[1:01:44.920 --> 1:01:50.880]  specific details in terms of analyzing what they're saying this is our evidence
[1:01:50.880 --> 1:01:54.080]  and it's circumstantial and it's circumstantial evidence that doesn't
[1:01:54.080 --> 1:01:56.880]  hold water so we're going to talk to him about that I also want to get his
[1:01:56.880 --> 1:02:01.320]  comments on the increasing surveillance that we're seeing from the internet of
[1:02:01.320 --> 1:02:04.680]  things and that's something we all should be very concerned about geospatial
[1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:09.920]  intelligence looking at what we're doing is far more damaging far more dangerous
[1:02:09.920 --> 1:02:13.640]  than them recording our conversations recording our texts because they're
[1:02:13.640 --> 1:02:16.840]  going to feed that into an algorithm we've talked about this quite some time
[1:02:16.840 --> 1:02:21.520]  and come up with a minority report that's going to flag you perhaps falsely
[1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:26.440]  for being a suspect or let other people go through the loop and we've seen
[1:02:26.440 --> 1:02:30.600]  people that have been hit put on a no-fly list for absolutely no reasons
[1:02:30.600 --> 1:02:33.640]  one of the first stories I report on when I came here by the way this is all
[1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:37.280]  official the communist Chinese announced a year and a half ago Paul Watson wrote
[1:02:37.280 --> 1:02:42.560]  about a drug link to it they have a internet social score that government
[1:02:42.560 --> 1:02:46.120]  corporations will will create for you whether you like it or not that follows
[1:02:46.120 --> 1:02:49.720]  you if you criticize government or globalist corporations they lower your
[1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:53.760]  score and if your score goes low enough you physically won't get jobs in the
[1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:58.200]  real world so this this takes the yellow stars on the Jews or whatever or the
[1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:02.560]  pink triangles on the gay people in Nazi Germany and takes it to you know five
[1:03:02.560 --> 1:03:07.960]  six levels up oh yeah it's not a question of is this going to happen this is
[1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:14.000]  the larger plan now the way to counter this is to flood independent media we're
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:18.400]  not we're not the alternative folks we are the true press the true independent
[1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:22.640]  we wear our bias of telling the truth loving freedom on our slaves we are the
[1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:27.800]  cutting edge of this and we absolutely need your prayers your support we need

[1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:22.080]  of control but it's totally unnatural when you move with your feet and with

[1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:39.720]  talking about the Internet of Things and Trump warning people of the Internet
[1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:45.320]  of Things we can also get the clip of the FBI director saying cover up the
[1:04:45.320 --> 1:04:51.000]  video camera on your computer screen cover up your webcam because people are
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:56.280]  watching you now remember we told folks this 20 years ago when web cams were
[1:04:56.280 --> 1:05:02.920]  first coming out just where to CNN find their news sources if you recall they
[1:05:02.920 --> 1:05:06.640]  first suggested that the Russians hack the election to help get Donald Trump
[1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:10.560]  elected and yesterday they're reporting now that Intel chiefs are presenting
[1:05:10.560 --> 1:05:14.720]  Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him what they're insinuating
[1:05:14.720 --> 1:05:18.400]  directly quoting here from their website classified documents presented last
[1:05:18.400 --> 1:05:22.600]  week the president Obama and president elect Trump included allegations the
[1:05:22.600 --> 1:05:26.120]  Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial
[1:05:26.120 --> 1:05:29.880]  information about Trump this of course is coming from quote multiple US
[1:05:29.880 --> 1:05:33.840]  officials with direct knowledge on the briefings oh really what they're
[1:05:33.840 --> 1:05:39.040]  insinuating is that the Russians have finance secrets and sexual deviant secrets
[1:05:39.040 --> 1:05:42.640]  about Trump that could be used to blackmail him they're also claiming that
[1:05:42.640 --> 1:05:46.320]  one reason the nation's intelligence chiefs took an extraordinary step of
[1:05:46.320 --> 1:05:49.640]  including the synopsis in the briefing of documents was to make Donald Trump
[1:05:49.640 --> 1:05:53.440]  aware that such allegations involving him were circulating among their
[1:05:53.440 --> 1:05:57.120]  agencies I can't make this up if I tried I'm Margaret hell reporting for info

[1:08:34.760 --> 1:08:40.160]  mackavy a personal friend of mine a great patriot a defender of free speech
[1:08:40.160 --> 1:08:44.520]  and internet rights he's going to be breaking down in the next hour just a
[1:08:44.520 --> 1:08:48.680]  host of issues he's also as a security expert everybody knows he found a
[1:08:48.680 --> 1:08:52.720]  mackafee one of the top hackers out there today he was able to hack the
[1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:56.120]  believes in government they exposed their connections to jihadis and a
[1:08:56.120 --> 1:09:01.000]  riots and plotted so much more before it was all confirmed three years later to
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:04.320]  be true just just simply incredible I got to be honest with you I was kind of
[1:09:04.320 --> 1:09:08.160]  halfway rolling my eyes it was just so came spawn s but it did indeed happen he
[1:09:08.160 --> 1:09:12.680]  hacked in the other microphones and cameras that was what six years ago now
[1:09:12.680 --> 1:09:17.480]  five years ago so he sort of break down the so-called CIA report but just on
[1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:21.480]  the surface forget the technical stuff he's going to break that down on the
[1:09:21.480 --> 1:09:26.560]  surface it's like tumbling oh two years ago on RT someone said something bad
[1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:30.200]  about Hillary well I mean the whole media ganged up on Trump and the
[1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:35.520]  American people it was a hundred times what RT's effect ever was and it blew up
[1:09:35.520 --> 1:09:39.880]  in their face so now there's this new report about golden showers and
[1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:43.800]  prostitutes peeping on people I mean I'm sorry folks that's what it is just
[1:09:43.800 --> 1:09:47.560]  totally ridiculous that's the kind of stuff the Clintons are into but here
[1:09:47.560 --> 1:09:52.360]  they are ladies and gentlemen blaming it on Trump with no evidence showing how
[1:09:52.360 --> 1:09:57.200]  the control they are and here it is CNN leading the anti fake news narrative
[1:09:57.200 --> 1:10:01.240]  when they are the biggest deceivers caught using blue screens at Sandy Hook
[1:10:01.240 --> 1:10:04.840]  caught you know using fake reporters caught interviewing their own
[1:10:04.840 --> 1:10:09.840]  reporters as witnesses I mean this is a pack of liars we've got a bunch of
[1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:13.520]  clips now throughout the hour coming up of Trump's press conference that went
[1:10:13.520 --> 1:10:17.920]  for what two and a half hours that will be interspersed with McAfee and others
[1:10:17.920 --> 1:10:22.960]  I'm going to go ahead and punch out of here with this clip of Trump earlier
[1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:27.080]  today breaking down the fact that the Internet of Things is very very dangerous
[1:10:27.080 --> 1:10:30.840]  and we've got to be aware of it and have to be concerned about it that's why
[1:10:30.840 --> 1:10:34.920]  Trump doesn't allow computers basically around him at Trump Tower but before I
[1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:40.920]  do that just briefly one more time ladies and gentlemen the reason I'm so
[1:10:40.920 --> 1:10:45.360]  excited is we are changing the world we are promoting freedom we are promoting
[1:10:45.360 --> 1:10:51.440]  the Renaissance when I say that it isn't just words we are promoting populism we
[1:10:51.440 --> 1:10:55.200]  are promoting prosperity we are promoting being honorable we are promoting
[1:10:55.200 --> 1:10:59.880]  free will and free association we're promoting true classical liberalism
[1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:04.720]  which means keep more of your taxes have a right to protect yourself empower the
[1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:08.800]  individual they've they've changed all the terms they've scrambled it but now
[1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:12.560]  we've made the Republican Democratic establishment naked we know they're
[1:11:12.560 --> 1:11:16.440]  working together and they're panicking McCain even rags as David
[1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:21.400]  nightson lost our that he's behind this Russia blackmail made up crap he's so
[1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:26.160]  insane he publicly met with al-Qaeda and al-Nusra and said they're great guys
[1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:30.160]  when they've been killing at that time tens of thousands of Christians and
[1:11:30.160 --> 1:11:34.680]  others now it's hundreds of thousands I mean he's a monster totally disconnected
[1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:39.080]  from reality when they're the ones that are compromised by foreign powers by
[1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:45.360]  globalism by the fortune 100 that are the real global threat and the real
[1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:49.840]  group infiltrating our lives taking control of our societies and trying to
[1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:54.240]  play us off against Russia who's not doing anything to us the globalist are
[1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:59.360]  allied with China there the threat Islam radical Islam is the threat
[1:11:59.360 --> 1:12:03.640]  China is the threat if Russia was a threat I've never been to Russia I
[1:12:03.640 --> 1:12:09.320]  would come out against Russia in a second but that said I can now tell you
[1:12:09.320 --> 1:12:13.760]  without a shadow of a doubt Trump's the real deal he knows the whole enchilada
[1:12:13.760 --> 1:12:19.720]  he knew it before I was even born he basically knows everything the John
[1:12:19.720 --> 1:12:24.160]  Berks society knows him more okay since he's like 20 some years old he's the
[1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:28.800]  original Alex Jones and he was so smart and played such a long game with these
[1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:33.920]  people waiting waiting for the moment pitting op-eds he paid for your staff
[1:12:33.920 --> 1:12:37.440]  to get hoping things would get turned around he watched him in earlier clips
[1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:40.880]  he kept hoping somebody would show up and do it he didn't want to do it this
[1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:45.840]  guy is literally doing this for America he's even putting on the big smug act
[1:12:45.840 --> 1:12:48.680]  everybody likes for the public that's not even Donald Trump Donald Trump is a
[1:12:48.680 --> 1:12:53.880]  really quiet focused idiot savant level political brain and they are
[1:12:53.880 --> 1:12:58.880]  horrified they've got the real dossier on him this guy is so Americana that it
[1:12:58.880 --> 1:13:04.720]  gets like vampires are scared of the sun at midday and it is an amazing
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:08.080]  time so that's why I'm so excited it's why I'm begging all of you to realize
[1:13:08.080 --> 1:13:11.480]  we've got to spread the word we've got to take action but we are targets
[1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:16.880]  Trump is a target I'm a target which I can tell you folks I wish I could tell
[1:13:16.880 --> 1:13:22.760]  you it's beyond it's beyond you know a born supremacy movie okay I mean I can't
[1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:25.600]  tell you all this I just can't tell you I'm not allowed to okay I just got stopped
[1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:30.440]  right there but believe me this is beyond any movie any spy novel anything
[1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:34.600]  you've ever heard of this is this is this is this is I just can't tell you I
[1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:38.040]  mean just look how crazy the show already is look at what we're doing with you
[1:13:38.040 --> 1:13:42.440]  together it's already just completely over the top it's three times that folks
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:46.480]  but it's hopefully I'll be able to tell you some of this stuff soon but it is
[1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:51.800]  this is the battle for America happening right now and all of you understand
[1:13:51.800 --> 1:13:54.520]  that the Patriots and our military the Patriots and our government the Patriots
[1:13:54.520 --> 1:13:59.000]  and corporations that hate what's happening they all look to you as the
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:03.120]  as the real resistance you're it spreading the word taking action they
[1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:07.000]  want to thank you I want to thank you stop thanking us okay you got that
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:11.520]  backwards I want to thank you for bucking the system bucking the brainwashing
[1:14:11.520 --> 1:14:15.360]  bucking the control let's play the clip of Trump earlier today talking about what
[1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:18.760]  John McAfee's been warning of for years they'll hand it over to John McAfee and
[1:14:18.760 --> 1:14:25.640]  of course David Knight when I leave our country I'm a very high-profile person
[1:14:25.640 --> 1:14:32.920]  would you say I am extremely careful I'm surrounded by bodyguards I'm surrounded
[1:14:32.920 --> 1:14:38.520]  by people and I always tell them anywhere but I always tell them if I'm
[1:14:38.520 --> 1:14:44.520]  leaving this country be very careful because in your hotel rooms and no
[1:14:44.520 --> 1:14:48.280]  matter where you go you're gonna probably have cameras I'm not referring just to
[1:14:48.280 --> 1:14:53.040]  Russia but I would certainly put them in that category and number one I hope
[1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:57.120]  you're gonna be good anyway but in those rooms you have cameras in the
[1:14:57.120 --> 1:15:02.720]  strangest places cameras that are so small with modern technology you can't
[1:15:02.720 --> 1:15:07.840]  see them and you won't know you better be careful or you'll be watching
[1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:16.280]  yourself or nightly television I tell this to people all the time I was in
[1:15:16.280 --> 1:15:21.720]  Russia years ago with the Miss Universe contest which did very well Moscow the
[1:15:21.720 --> 1:15:29.720]  Moscow area did very very well and I told many people be careful because you
[1:15:29.720 --> 1:15:34.200]  don't want to see yourself in television cameras all over the place and again not
[1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:40.040]  just Russia all over okay and I was Donald Trump today responding to the fake
[1:15:40.040 --> 1:15:44.360]  news claims from CNN and Buzzfeed that most of the media even the media that
[1:15:44.360 --> 1:15:48.680]  has been unfairly treating Donald Trump refused to cover they would not stoop
[1:15:48.680 --> 1:15:53.120]  that low but Buzzfeed it's a new standard and there you have Donald Trump
[1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:56.600]  talking about what we all know and saying I've said for years my people as
[1:15:56.600 --> 1:16:00.560]  they travel abroad be careful what you do people recording you especially when
[1:16:00.560 --> 1:16:03.680]  you're in hotels and joining us now is John McAfee and of course John McAfee
[1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:08.600]  is no stranger to any of this he's not naive about this John created McAfee
[1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:13.800]  associates back in 1987 30 years ago you know John the US government hasn't
[1:16:13.800 --> 1:16:17.160]  really done a very good job in protecting themselves or protecting us
[1:16:17.160 --> 1:16:21.200]  from cyber hacks in the interim years have they even though you've you're now
[1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:25.480]  not part of the company you sold this to Intel Corporation but it's probably the
[1:16:25.480 --> 1:16:30.040]  most famous anti-virus software out there certainly you understand what's
[1:16:30.040 --> 1:16:35.360]  going on with this I want you to speak to this intelligence report that we got
[1:16:35.360 --> 1:16:40.640]  about Russian hacking because this is a pretty patently absurd set of
[1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:45.720]  circumstantial evidence and then as they put that out even before they they put
[1:16:45.720 --> 1:16:48.400]  out their intelligence report that you're going to dissect here for us a
[1:16:48.400 --> 1:16:51.840]  little bit they put out another fake report about the Russians having hacked
[1:16:51.840 --> 1:16:54.840]  our power grid and then that was eventually exposed as a total fake
[1:16:54.840 --> 1:16:58.480]  fraud and now we've got this fake news that we've got today but let's talk
[1:16:58.480 --> 1:17:04.880]  about the intelligence report that has surfaced and the the circumstantial
[1:17:04.880 --> 1:17:07.840]  evidence that they put in there saying that this is how we know it was a
[1:17:07.840 --> 1:17:16.960]  Russian's well I've read that entire 25 page report multiple times and half of
[1:17:16.960 --> 1:17:24.560]  it is laughable it is absurd beyond belief for example they're expecting us
[1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:31.840]  to believe that the Russian intelligence services are foolish enough to leave the
[1:17:31.840 --> 1:17:37.360]  Russian language in the code to leave the date and time stamp that the
[1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:43.160]  program was compiled to use a Cyrillic keyboard which could be which could be
[1:17:43.160 --> 1:17:50.560]  detected by forensic science and lastly to have an IP address it points back to
[1:17:50.560 --> 1:17:56.520]  the Russian Kremlin seriously imagine what would happen here in America if the
[1:17:56.520 --> 1:18:03.400]  CIA were to hack Russia and we left the IP address of the programmer on the
[1:18:03.400 --> 1:18:07.480]  second floor of the CIA offices yeah that's why I'm gonna ask you did they did
[1:18:07.480 --> 1:18:12.640]  they find the name rank and serial number of the KGB officer that that's
[1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:17.280]  about the only thing they didn't find yeah so in all sincerity this and they
[1:18:17.280 --> 1:18:21.600]  also claim that this is the type of software that the Russians use well
[1:18:21.600 --> 1:18:25.840]  unfortunately it's a type of software that hundreds of thousands of hackers
[1:18:25.840 --> 1:18:31.640]  also use once a piece of software is out there it gets onto the dark web and
[1:18:31.640 --> 1:18:37.040]  everybody's using it so the way that this was done and the lack of
[1:18:37.040 --> 1:18:42.080]  sophistication suggests a 15 year old boy or an 18 year old somewhere who's
[1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:47.400]  bored in their bedroom at night going let's see if I can hack into the DNC and
[1:18:47.400 --> 1:18:52.280]  with that software of course they could the DNC was not protected either
[1:18:52.280 --> 1:18:58.240]  physically or by education because it was a simple fishing technique that got
[1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:03.160]  them in meaning somebody opened an email and clicked a link from someone they
[1:19:03.160 --> 1:19:10.120]  did not know yeah I mean how bizarre how absurd so it cannot possibly have been
[1:19:10.120 --> 1:19:14.800]  a nation-state live along the Russian nation-state they are way too
[1:19:14.800 --> 1:19:20.480]  sophisticated to make that many mistakes and if they were unsophisticated we
[1:19:20.480 --> 1:19:23.800]  really wouldn't have anything to worry about with the Russians would we and yet
[1:19:23.800 --> 1:19:28.440]  they are far more sophisticated than that report would indicate so we do have
[1:19:28.440 --> 1:19:32.200]  something to be concerned about but not that it's absurd beyond belief absurd
[1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:36.280]  beyond belief plus the software that was used is a year and a half old and
[1:19:36.280 --> 1:19:43.160]  has had many updates since that time so in all sincerity do you think the the
[1:19:43.160 --> 1:19:47.200]  Russians spent all of this time updating and fixing their bugs and then
[1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:52.240]  decided to use the software piece that was a year and a half old no everything
[1:19:52.240 --> 1:19:58.440]  points to a teenager or a very unsophisticated hacker yeah and of course
[1:19:58.440 --> 1:20:01.960]  you know there's two different issues here there's the Podesta emails which
[1:20:01.960 --> 1:20:07.960]  were a fishing attack and then there's also the DNC data which we've had a
[1:20:07.960 --> 1:20:12.000]  former British ambassador say hey I traveled to United States and that
[1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:15.840]  information was handed to me in a park and we had a the current British
[1:20:15.840 --> 1:20:19.400]  ambassador saying you know I had some people tell me when I was in Washington
[1:20:19.400 --> 1:20:23.360]  that they were involved in turning that information over so that looks like bait
[1:20:23.360 --> 1:20:25.880]  if you want to believe the British ambassadors of course they don't even
[1:20:25.880 --> 1:20:29.440]  talk about that they don't give that any credibility in mainstream media but if
[1:20:29.440 --> 1:20:33.640]  you believe those British ambassadors that wasn't even a hack it wasn't even
[1:20:33.640 --> 1:20:40.400]  a fishing attack it could very easily have been an inside job yeah we do not
[1:20:40.400 --> 1:20:47.960]  know here's the thing if a hacker organization is smart enough technologically
[1:20:47.960 --> 1:20:52.720]  competent enough which we must assume the Russian government is just like we
[1:20:52.720 --> 1:20:59.840]  are then there is simply no way to trace that back even though in the report
[1:20:59.840 --> 1:21:06.200]  there's a sentence in the report that says it is extremely difficult to find
[1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:12.680]  attribution for any hack but not impossible and then they go on to say we
[1:21:12.680 --> 1:21:18.160]  we know what specific tools people use we know how they act well good lord
[1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:23.720]  that's how all hackers act and all hackers use the same tools either are
[1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:32.000]  and without disrespecting our intelligence services we are they are
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:37.480]  either naive or they are purposely deceiving us one or the other well a
[1:21:37.480 --> 1:21:41.360]  dog that has embarked here of course in the mainstream media is the fact that
[1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:46.400]  Hillary Clinton did disrespect our intelligence services when she put secret
[1:21:46.400 --> 1:21:51.160]  and above top secret emails and communications on her server that was
[1:21:51.160 --> 1:21:55.040]  not secure that was easily hacked and we know for a fact if they're gonna tell
[1:21:55.040 --> 1:21:59.080]  us that the Russians went in and got information about John Podesta's emails
[1:21:59.080 --> 1:22:01.840]  do you think they would get it from Hillary Clinton's emails and yet they
[1:22:01.840 --> 1:22:05.640]  don't ever make that connection when they're talking about it that's a dead
[1:22:05.640 --> 1:22:09.440]  giveaway that this is all about politics isn't it of course it's about
[1:22:09.440 --> 1:22:15.280]  politics and of course this is politically motivated and and anybody
[1:22:15.280 --> 1:22:20.640]  could see this if they look through the the the smoke and mirrors that the
[1:22:20.640 --> 1:22:25.400]  intelligence service is giving us it is it's a trivial thing for us especially
[1:22:25.400 --> 1:22:31.200]  any cyber security specialist will see the holes in this system I want to ask
[1:22:31.200 --> 1:22:34.160]  you about the way that they're presenting this and of course the
[1:22:34.160 --> 1:22:38.440]  language is everything they'll go out and talk about how the Russians hacked our
[1:22:38.440 --> 1:22:42.200]  election but then they are not very specific about that when you go down
[1:22:42.200 --> 1:22:45.120]  and look at what they're actually saying when they say the Russians quote-unquote
[1:22:45.120 --> 1:22:49.440]  hacked our election they're not saying that the Russians got into our electronic
[1:22:49.440 --> 1:22:52.680]  voting machines are in the tabulating areas what they're saying is that the
[1:22:52.680 --> 1:22:57.040]  Russians released true information about Hillary Clinton and the DNC and John
[1:22:57.040 --> 1:23:01.080]  Podesta that cost her the election when we found out what she was about but
[1:23:01.080 --> 1:23:05.880]  John when they talk about hacking the election hacking the election I believe
[1:23:05.880 --> 1:23:09.360]  I want to get your comments on this do you see it this way I think they're
[1:23:09.360 --> 1:23:14.000]  creating a problem and creating an image in the minds of the American public
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:17.240]  that what was involved here was Russians actually getting into our voting
[1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:21.040]  machines because then the follow-up that they did to this was Jay Johnson
[1:23:21.040 --> 1:23:26.560]  unilaterally declaring hey we're going to get involved directly into the
[1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:31.560]  elections even after it surfaced that Homeland Security had tried to hack into
[1:23:31.560 --> 1:23:36.240]  multiple state Board of Elections computers so they were the hackers
[1:23:36.240 --> 1:23:39.960]  trying to get into the computers and now they're saying hey and we're going to do
[1:23:39.960 --> 1:23:44.280]  that we're going to use this as an excuse aren't they subtly creating a
[1:23:44.280 --> 1:23:47.800]  psychological problem in the minds of people that they're not technically
[1:23:47.800 --> 1:23:52.120]  saying exists and then using that to insert themselves into our electronic
[1:23:52.120 --> 1:23:56.440]  voting machines in future elections well that's just entirely possible but I
[1:23:56.440 --> 1:24:02.080]  think I think the motive defined behind what's happening now is you notice that
[1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:07.600]  as soon as we started pointing fingers at Russia as trying to manipulate our
[1:24:07.600 --> 1:24:12.320]  elections nobody's paying any attention to the actual e-mails anymore that's
[1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:16.600]  right isn't that the real problem oh yeah isn't that isn't isn't that what
[1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:22.600]  this is truly about misconduct that no one's paying any attention to now
[1:24:22.600 --> 1:24:27.940]  because we have a misdirection going over something far more important than
[1:24:27.940 --> 1:24:32.560]  this misconduct and that is the fact that it was the Russians that told us
[1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:38.160]  about it please wake up America wake the f up yeah I think the military
[1:24:38.160 --> 1:24:41.000]  industrial complex obviously we know that they're trying to restart and have
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:45.520]  restarted the Cold War with Russia and they want to tie Donald Trump's hands
[1:24:45.520 --> 1:24:48.840]  because he's indicated that he wants to de-escalate those tensions he wants to
[1:24:48.840 --> 1:24:52.360]  have a detente and easing of relations and so they want to tie his hands by
[1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:56.260]  saying you're a Russian agent you are controlled by the Russians all these
[1:24:56.260 --> 1:25:00.600]  different fake news stories continue to have that theme as you pointed out it's
[1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:04.200]  a very convenient theme for them to have as they did in the run-up to the
[1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:08.120]  election to divert attention away from what Hillary Clinton and the DNC were
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:11.080]  actually doing nobody was talking about well what's what's actually happened
[1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:13.960]  here instead of where did this information come from we always see that
[1:25:13.960 --> 1:25:18.560]  when a whistleblower exposes criminal actions they always attack the whistle
[1:25:18.560 --> 1:25:22.480] blower to distract people from the crimes that have been exposed but I'm also
[1:25:22.480 --> 1:25:26.560]  concerned about the security of electronic voting machines I think all
[1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:31.360]  of those things are involved here aren't they oh I'm gonna be really frank with
[1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:37.520]  you if our voting machines have not been hacked by someone and if they happen
[1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:41.760]  it's been most likely by one or the other of our political parties yes then
[1:25:41.760 --> 1:25:46.080]  I'll eat one of my shoes yes because voting machines are no different than
[1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:52.560]  any other computer they were designed and built by private companies that
[1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:57.960]  employ thousands of people now I promise you you know human nature if you
[1:25:57.960 --> 1:26:03.400]  have 1,000 people I guarantee you one or two of them are going to be bad apples
[1:26:03.400 --> 1:26:09.800]  they're going to be people who are planted there by your competition or by the
[1:26:09.800 --> 1:26:15.760]  Democratic Party or the Republican Party or the Chinese or someone and because
[1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:21.960]  of that I promise you these machines are hackable and have been hacked oh we
[1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:25.600]  absolutely know they have we've we've seen the demonstrations every time we
[1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:29.160]  have an election we have somebody at a local radio state television station
[1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:32.600]  bring some kids in from a nearby computer and they said look we can put this
[1:26:32.600 --> 1:26:37.240]  stuff on a USB drive we stick it in and I'm gonna now operate the machine and
[1:26:37.240 --> 1:26:40.280]  it's going to record completely different votes than I've done and then I'm
[1:26:40.280 --> 1:26:43.480]  gonna pull this thing out it's going to erase the fact that it ever did in this
[1:26:43.480 --> 1:26:48.040]  after it just the adjust the totals and of course we understand that that's
[1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:52.200]  there the thing that concerns me as we're looking at this of course John it
[1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:59.360]  is the fact that as you know you can have when you create a piece of a business
[1:26:59.360 --> 1:27:02.640]  entity or you create some software there's something that you can do that's
[1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:06.480]  locally but you also want to eventually get it to something that is an
[1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:11.920]  enterprise operation that is scalable that is extendable to a large area and
[1:27:11.920 --> 1:27:16.680]  that's what I'm concerned about with the moves of Homeland Security now we know
[1:27:16.680 --> 1:27:19.920]  that all of these machines are vulnerable that people can go in but they
[1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:24.800]  can't do it in a large scale if they can pull this thing together under some
[1:27:24.800 --> 1:27:29.040]  kind of centralized control seems to me they'd be very easy for them to scale
[1:27:29.040 --> 1:27:33.400]  this kind of corruption and a massive level beyond what they've been able to
[1:27:33.400 --> 1:27:37.600]  do at this point and we still have elements of our of our election system
[1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:41.560]  that are paper and every one of these little jurisdictions has different
[1:27:41.560 --> 1:27:44.280]  machines if they do have machines they got different machines some of them
[1:27:44.280 --> 1:27:48.000]  have machines some of them have paper so what they're trying to do I think with
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:52.280]  this move after saying hey the Russians hacked our election I think they're
[1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:58.680]  trying to create a more homogeneous system that they can then scale their
[1:27:58.680 --> 1:28:09.520]  corruption to we are not prepared for electronic voting we just not we don't
[1:28:09.520 --> 1:28:15.960]  have the cyber security in place the secure systems that can guarantee that
[1:28:15.960 --> 1:28:21.760]  these things cannot be hacked we don't we have to stay with a paper system for
[1:28:21.760 --> 1:28:25.600]  for many years many years you must believe me I agree
[1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:32.920]  hackers are clever beyond belief and we are in a very slippery slope here where
[1:28:32.920 --> 1:28:40.320]  the slightest misstep will will turn this nation from a democracy into a
[1:28:40.320 --> 1:28:48.400]  theocracy or an oligarchy or a dictatorship yeah and we can't let
[1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:52.240]  that happen I'm sorry we just not ready I don't care what the voting machine
[1:28:52.240 --> 1:28:56.200]  people tell you the ones that make them to create them and sell them we're not
[1:28:56.200 --> 1:29:01.680]  ready well you know that very well because you business and that was 30
[1:29:01.680 --> 1:29:07.280]  years ago McAfee is constantly adjusting and adapting to the constantly
[1:29:07.280 --> 1:29:12.160]  evolving threats nothing ever stays static and so anybody if they're
[1:29:12.160 --> 1:29:15.760]  involved in countermeasures to that kind of hacking or corruption or viruses
[1:29:15.760 --> 1:29:20.240]  you have to constantly be modifying your system and we know from a fact that
[1:29:20.240 --> 1:29:24.800]  we've had all the personnel records of the US military hacked and turned over
[1:29:24.800 --> 1:29:28.480]  we know that the government is an open book we know that people like Hillary
[1:29:28.480 --> 1:29:31.840]  Clinton have absolutely no regard for this and no understanding of what's
[1:29:31.840 --> 1:29:35.120]  happened here I mean that's the other part of the story is the gross
[1:29:35.120 --> 1:29:38.920]  incompetence of Hillary Clinton we got to take a quick break when we come back I
[1:29:38.920 --> 1:29:42.320]  want to talk to you about that and where we should go what should we do this is

[1:30:07.080 --> 1:30:11.240]  state of American democracy a warning that resonated eerily similar to the
[1:30:11.240 --> 1:30:15.480]  one that George Soros gave shortly after Trump won the election the telegraph is
[1:30:15.480 --> 1:30:18.480]  saying it's because of his speech on Tuesday night that's even more
[1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:21.600]  remarkable than anything he's done in the past eight years he was preaching
[1:30:21.600 --> 1:30:24.440]  change and hope throughout those eight years he's now ending his quote
[1:30:24.440 --> 1:30:28.080]  leadership with an urgent warning about the state of American democracy and
[1:30:28.080 --> 1:30:31.960]  affairs one writer says it was a thinly veiled slate to a divisive rhetoric

[1:30:35.600 --> 1:30:40.440]  disabled women and immigrants what news source are they looking at CNN on what
[1:30:40.440 --> 1:30:45.160]  planet did Donald Trump attack any of those anyway mr. Obama went on to say
[1:30:45.160 --> 1:30:49.080]  if we don't create opportunity for all people the disaffection and division
[1:30:49.080 --> 1:30:53.000]  that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come goodbye mr.
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:57.080]  Obama and farewell oh and thanks for the speech I'm Margaret hell reporting

[1:33:27.120 --> 1:33:32.120]  also got John McAfee the legendary internet security expert of course of
[1:33:32.120 --> 1:33:35.760]  McAfee and breaking everything down you know I think we've kind of won this
[1:33:35.760 --> 1:33:41.120]  battle we we know the report the 25 page reports fake we know that it's mainly a
[1:33:41.120 --> 1:33:44.720]  bunch of whining about a whole killer we lost the election the old powerful
[1:33:44.720 --> 1:33:49.640]  Russians did it they criticized her boo I mean it's totally insane everything
[1:33:49.640 --> 1:33:54.160]  they're accusing Russia of they themselves have done but the epic clips that
[1:33:54.160 --> 1:33:59.440]  are up on info wars.com right now are just incredible and I don't overuse the
[1:33:59.440 --> 1:34:04.280]  word epic we live in epic times I mean all times have been pretty darn important
[1:34:04.280 --> 1:34:10.920]  but if you go to info wars.com right now there's the word epic EPIC epic epic
[1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:15.560]  Trump shuts down CNN reporter calls network fake news this is what I've
[1:34:15.560 --> 1:34:20.720]  been begging for the news always wants to know when I talk about Trump the news
[1:34:20.720 --> 1:34:23.920]  always wants to know when I'm talking to Trump what we talk about well I talk
[1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:28.480]  about how great it is when he calls out the mainstream media as a fraud when he
[1:34:28.480 --> 1:34:31.760]  tells them they're slimy when he when he ignores them when he doesn't invite
[1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:35.320]  them to press conferences when he doesn't tell them his itinerary these
[1:34:35.320 --> 1:34:39.840]  people are so arrogant they're in their own world and the key to breaking
[1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:43.520]  mainstream media is back forever is realizing their back is already broken
[1:34:43.520 --> 1:34:48.520]  so the full video is up on info wars.com Trump calls several mainstream press
[1:34:48.520 --> 1:34:52.400]  organizations terrible that there are several clips we're gonna play back to
[1:34:52.400 --> 1:34:56.680]  back right now and then I'll let David Knight introduce the rest of them and
[1:34:56.680 --> 1:35:02.680]  let Mr. McAfee obviously break it down but this is the info war stay with us
[1:35:02.680 --> 1:35:09.400]  that turned out to be so false and fake out I think it's a disgrace and I say
[1:35:09.400 --> 1:35:14.080]  that and I say that and that's something that Nazi Germany would have done and
[1:35:14.080 --> 1:35:19.760]  did do I think it's a disgrace that information that was false and fake and
[1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:25.360]  never happened got released to the public as far as Buzzfeed which is a
[1:35:25.360 --> 1:35:30.600]  failing pile of garbage writing it I think they're gonna suffer the
[1:35:30.600 --> 1:35:36.200]  consequences they already are and as far as CNN going out of their way to build
[1:35:36.200 --> 1:35:40.360]  it up and by the way we just found out I was coming down Michael Kohn I was
[1:35:40.360 --> 1:35:43.400]  being a Michael Kohn is a very talented lawyer is a good lawyer in my firm
[1:35:43.400 --> 1:35:47.600]  who's just reported that it wasn't this Michael Kohn they were talking about so
[1:35:47.600 --> 1:35:52.280]  all night long it's Michael Kohn I said I want to see your passport he brings
[1:35:52.280 --> 1:35:56.600]  his passport to my office I say hey wait a minute he didn't leave the country he
[1:35:56.600 --> 1:36:00.440]  wasn't out of the country they had Michael Kohn of the Trump organization was
[1:36:00.440 --> 1:36:04.760]  in Prague it turned out to be a different Michael Kohn it's a disgrace
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:09.080]  what took place it's a disgrace and I think they were to apologize to start
[1:36:09.080 --> 1:36:11.160]  with Michael Kohn
[1:36:11.160 --> 1:36:13.160]  since you're attacking us can you give us a question
[1:36:13.160 --> 1:36:17.560]  since you're no Mr. President-elect go ahead since you are attacking our news
[1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:21.200]  organization now can you give us a chance you are attacking our news

[1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:49.240]  President Obama went too far with the sanctions he put on Russia after the
[1:36:49.240 --> 1:36:53.120]  hacking do you think they're going too far what will you roll them back what
[1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:57.760]  do you think of Lindsey Graham I don't say send you a bill for tougher one okay
[1:36:57.760 --> 1:37:00.840]  we knew this was going to be a combative press conference that he just saw the
[1:37:00.840 --> 1:37:04.680]  back and forth between CNN and Donald Trump we've got another clip I want to
[1:37:04.680 --> 1:37:09.560]  run that and then we're going to go back to John McAfee let's run that next clip
[1:37:09.560 --> 1:37:13.560]  got that next clip ready maybe we don't have that next clip
[1:37:13.560 --> 1:37:19.040]  information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the
[1:37:19.040 --> 1:37:26.120]  public as far as Buzzfeed which is a failing pile of garbage writing it I
[1:37:26.120 --> 1:37:30.200]  think they're going to suffer the consequences they already are and as far
[1:37:30.200 --> 1:37:35.720]  as CNN going out of their way to build it up and by the way we just found out I
[1:37:35.720 --> 1:37:39.080]  was coming down Michael Cohn I was being come Michael Cohn is a very talented
[1:37:39.080 --> 1:37:43.040]  lawyer is a good lawyer my firm who's just reported that it wasn't this Michael
[1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:47.160]  Cohn they were talking about so all night long it's Michael Cohn I said I
[1:37:47.160 --> 1:37:51.800]  want to see your passport he brings his passport to my office I say hey wait a
[1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:55.640]  minute he didn't leave the country he wasn't out of the country they had Michael

[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:04.600]  Michael Cohn it's a disgrace what took place it's a disgrace and I think they
[1:38:04.600 --> 1:38:08.280]  ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohn
[1:38:22.280 --> 1:38:25.720]  that's the back and forth that's going on you know John McAfee we were just
[1:38:25.720 --> 1:38:30.400]  talking about this in the last break and and of course they have been pushing
[1:38:30.400 --> 1:38:34.440]  further and further dropping further and further in the esteem of the public as
[1:38:34.440 --> 1:38:38.200]  they try to sell this phony narrative you broke it down in the last bit you
[1:38:38.200 --> 1:38:42.640]  said look this is absolutely ridiculous we've had William Benny former
[1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:47.640]  technical head of the NSA say this is ridiculous we've had Ray McGovern who
[1:38:47.640 --> 1:38:51.280]  used to give a briefs for the CIA to the former presidents he said this is
[1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:55.680]  nonsense and yet we do have people inside the CIA that are very politically
[1:38:55.680 --> 1:39:00.800]  involved they're trying to sell this narrative we got the guy who took over
[1:39:00.800 --> 1:39:08.920]  after David Petraeus was thrown out of the being head of the CIA for violating
[1:39:08.920 --> 1:39:14.080]  national security the guy that took over from him Morrell was a never-trumper or
[1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:17.680]  Hillary Clinton supporter and he didn't have any problems David Petraeus or
[1:39:17.680 --> 1:39:20.760]  Hillary Clinton violating national security that's precisely what William
[1:39:20.760 --> 1:39:24.000]  Benny was saying he said there's a lot of people in national security that
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:27.240]  understand this is very important you understand it's very important that's
[1:39:27.240 --> 1:39:31.120]  why you started running you announced your independent candidacy here on the
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:36.420]  Alex Jones show because you want to bring attention to our vulnerability for
[1:39:36.420 --> 1:39:39.760]  cybersecurity and you wanted to do it in a way that would that would do
[1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:43.520]  something about it and they went on to run for the libertarian nomination but
[1:39:43.520 --> 1:39:49.080]  this is a real issue what can we do what should we do in this country to protect
[1:39:49.080 --> 1:39:52.800]  ourselves instead of just trying to score political points as we see being
[1:39:52.800 --> 1:39:57.880]  done by the CIA and by the mainstream media I think the first thing we have
[1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:03.600]  to do is accept the fact that we are vulnerable the reason I ran for president
[1:40:03.600 --> 1:40:07.240]  in the libertarian party I mean you know I know everybody knows I could not
[1:40:07.240 --> 1:40:12.600]  possibly be threat be president with the baggage that I carry however it gave me
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:18.600]  a platform from which I could speak about something extremely important which
[1:40:18.600 --> 1:40:25.400]  is America's lack of cyber security lack of cyber awareness we are bamboozled
[1:40:25.400 --> 1:40:30.680]  by our government but they can put out these 25 page reports and suddenly
[1:40:30.680 --> 1:40:36.640]  every news agency except for the places like Alex Jones or RT where I was
[1:40:36.640 --> 1:40:42.400]  talking last night everybody's just repeating it as if it's true without
[1:40:42.400 --> 1:40:48.560]  thinking it through without understanding the basic precepts of cyber security
[1:40:48.560 --> 1:40:54.000]  and what is possible and what is not possible and what is in this report this
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:41:00.520]  25 page report is simply not possible now the only people who understand that
[1:41:00.520 --> 1:41:05.800]  are the cyber security specialists who listens to us yeah is anybody called in
[1:41:05.800 --> 1:41:11.680]  from mainstream media I've been on RT twice I've been on London radio and a
[1:41:11.680 --> 1:41:17.360]  national business times in London but here in America nobody why because my
[1:41:17.360 --> 1:41:24.640]  narrative denies the main narrative that the mainstream media is pushing and
[1:41:24.640 --> 1:41:28.560]  that's what we see for a very long time we had anybody we've seen this as a
[1:41:28.560 --> 1:41:33.680]  Kennedy assassination anybody that that questions the official government story
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:38.840]  is immediately categorized as a conspiracy theorist a tenfoil hat
[1:41:38.840 --> 1:41:42.320]  paranoid individual don't listen to them they're not saying the same thing that
[1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:45.720]  everybody else is doing and that worked for them for a very long time when we
[1:41:45.720 --> 1:41:50.480]  only had three TV networks because all three of the TV networks were dutifully
[1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:54.400]  doing exactly what the government and the CIA wanted to them to do they even
[1:41:54.400 --> 1:41:58.880]  had a program they called Operation Mockingbird that the CIA ran to to bring
[1:41:58.880 --> 1:42:02.720]  these people in but then once you started to get a more vibrant more
[1:42:02.720 --> 1:42:07.880]  diverse information landscape with the Internet then people started getting
[1:42:07.880 --> 1:42:11.560]  different bits of information and common sense started kicking in and people
[1:42:11.560 --> 1:42:14.840]  said wait a minute there isn't just one single story there are other stories out
[1:42:14.840 --> 1:42:18.720]  here we have been for a long time putting out information saying look we
[1:42:18.720 --> 1:42:22.720]  question this and here's why we question it that's why we talk to you about this
[1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:26.560]  why we want to get a cyber expert to talk about this you made a great point
[1:42:26.560 --> 1:42:31.080]  that if the Russians left all of these fingerprints on there then we don't
[1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:34.240]  really have anything to worry about because they're so grossly incompetent
[1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:39.360]  but of course it's to divert attention it's to tie Donald Trump's hands
[1:42:39.360 --> 1:42:42.520]  delegitimize him during the election try to take it away from him to tie his
[1:42:42.520 --> 1:42:47.240]  hands when he wants to ease relations with Russia but I'm very concerned about
[1:42:47.240 --> 1:42:53.240]  you also need to understand that the intelligence services have a chain of
[1:42:53.240 --> 1:42:59.320]  command and people have orders that there they simply follow and if someone
[1:42:59.320 --> 1:43:03.240]  comes into your office and says we have information we can't devolve where we
[1:43:03.240 --> 1:43:09.240]  got it where the Russians are hacking our election we need you to verify this
[1:43:09.240 --> 1:43:13.520]  well that's your job you're going to try to come up with whatever you can no matter
[1:43:13.520 --> 1:43:19.760]  how absurd I mean we can't blame our intelligence services because this is a
[1:43:19.760 --> 1:43:26.240]  politicized operation and who do most of the covert agencies report to the
[1:43:26.240 --> 1:43:33.560]  executive branch of the government president Obama so you know you're risking
[1:43:33.560 --> 1:43:38.360]  your what you're risking your job if you buck the train if you say your boss
[1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:42.880]  ball and what I found out is it are they they didn't hack it well what's gonna
[1:43:42.880 --> 1:43:47.320]  happen to you you're gonna be demoted at least you're gonna be ignored you're
[1:43:47.320 --> 1:43:53.080]  gonna be shoved aside you may be fired so you cannot blame all of these people
[1:43:53.080 --> 1:43:58.720]  they're a tight spot it is a politicized process in which we are all
[1:43:58.720 --> 1:44:03.280]  entrapped yes a very politicized process they have something that they want to
[1:44:03.280 --> 1:44:07.280]  hear and the intelligence services know that that's what they want to hear and
[1:44:07.280 --> 1:44:12.520]  we had recently we had one of the people who briefed George Bush about the
[1:44:12.520 --> 1:44:16.240]  interrogation of Saddam Hussein started talking to me said yeah when I started
[1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:20.400]  telling him some of the things that he didn't want to hear about Saddam Hussein
[1:44:20.400 --> 1:44:25.520]  his demeanor immediately changed he got very upset with me until I kind of walked
[1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:28.840]  it back a little bit but that was the thing they said oh we were misled by
[1:44:28.840 --> 1:44:32.800]  the intelligence services they told us at the time all 16 agencies are telling
[1:44:32.800 --> 1:44:36.760]  us that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction the same thing we're
[1:44:36.760 --> 1:44:40.920]  hearing now about the Russian hack quote-unquote and yet the intelligence
[1:44:40.920 --> 1:44:44.920]  services were telling them that because they knew that's what George Bush wanted
[1:44:44.920 --> 1:44:49.120]  to hear they knew that's what Colin Powell because they all reported to George
[1:44:49.120 --> 1:44:55.320]  Bush they had their jobs because of George Bush George Bush had the power to
[1:44:55.320 --> 1:45:00.840]  fire them all yes understand this so that if the intelligence services
[1:45:00.840 --> 1:45:06.880]  understand that their president demands specific intelligence then that's the
[1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:11.840]  intelligence they're going to give him the first self-preservation I mean some
[1:45:11.840 --> 1:45:15.120]  of these people are making a lot of money and have homes that they have to pay
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:20.160]  for and children they're putting through college and have to feed themselves oh yeah
[1:45:20.160 --> 1:45:23.760]  blame them all oh yeah it's absolutely it's a career and that's the interesting
[1:45:23.760 --> 1:45:27.160]  thing about it you know we go back to looking at World War two I thought it
[1:45:27.160 --> 1:45:30.360]  was interesting Donald Trump says one of the things he's going to do is bring
[1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:34.200]  back the bust of Churchill that Barack Obama got rid of I thought that was
[1:45:34.200 --> 1:45:37.080]  interesting I tweet out here Winston Churchill is going to be joining the
[1:45:37.080 --> 1:45:40.600]  Trump transition team but one of the things that Winston Churchill did in the
[1:45:40.600 --> 1:45:45.240]  lead up to World War two he had his own intelligence sources and his intelligence
[1:45:45.240 --> 1:45:47.920]  sources were telling him very different things and the politicized
[1:45:47.920 --> 1:45:53.680]  intelligence sources were telling the the people in government at the time and
[1:45:53.680 --> 1:45:59.680]  so I think that is a very key thing I think Trump is nobody's fool he has his
[1:45:59.680 --> 1:46:04.240]  own sources he has an independent mind and I think do we have this clip guys
[1:46:04.240 --> 1:46:08.280]  where Donald Trump was asked if he trusted intelligence officials we have
[1:46:08.280 --> 1:46:14.440]  that ready okay we don't have that yet okay but we do have a point during this
[1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:19.080]  news club where they asked him about that yeah I think that Donald Trump is
[1:46:19.080 --> 1:46:26.560]  clever enough to have his own intelligence community outside of the
[1:46:26.560 --> 1:46:34.000]  structured community of the NSA CIA the FBI and so on he would be crazy not to
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:39.880]  have given the history that we've we've seen they are in entire intelligence
[1:46:39.880 --> 1:46:45.920]  services all agreeing that Iraq that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction the
[1:46:45.920 --> 1:46:51.600]  entire intelligence community all agreeing with high probability that
[1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:57.400]  Russia hacked the DNC now by the way what was interesting to me is the one
[1:46:57.400 --> 1:47:02.480]  holdout was the NSA who instead of saying very high probability they say
[1:47:02.480 --> 1:47:08.480]  well with moderate probability we believe the Russians hacked the DNC well you
[1:47:08.480 --> 1:47:14.640]  know what that says well okay so at least there's some degree of courage yeah
[1:47:14.640 --> 1:47:20.680]  and essentially saying well it could have happened I don't think that was
[1:47:20.680 --> 1:47:25.480]  the only holdout yeah and no then it was only that from high probability to
[1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:30.680]  moderate well I appreciate that one little thing it tells me that at least
[1:47:30.680 --> 1:47:36.200]  somebody within the SA is going hey this is crazy people yes absolutely and we
[1:47:36.200 --> 1:47:39.320]  talked about the politicization politicization of the intelligence
[1:47:39.320 --> 1:47:43.600]  agencies you know Donald Trump had that tweet that's now very famous the as he
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:47.840]  put it quote intelligence he put intelligence in quote the intelligence
[1:47:47.840 --> 1:47:52.760]  briefing on so-called Russian hacking quote-unquote was delayed until Friday
[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:56.240]  perhaps more time needed to build a case very strange in other words I don't
[1:47:56.240 --> 1:47:58.920]  believe any of this stuff and I think what was even more interesting about
[1:47:58.920 --> 1:48:03.400]  that is the reaction of Chuck E. Schumer went on the Rachel Maddow show and Chuck
[1:48:03.400 --> 1:48:07.480]  Schumer said let me tell you you take on the intelligence community to have six
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:11.320]  ways from Sunday to get back at you so even for a practical supposedly hard
[1:48:11.320 --> 1:48:15.560]  nose businessman he's being really dumb to do this and she said well what do you
[1:48:15.560 --> 1:48:19.440]  think they're going to do and he goes well I don't know but from what I'm told
[1:48:19.440 --> 1:48:22.840]  they are very upset with how he's treated them and talked about them and so
[1:48:22.840 --> 1:48:28.200]  now here we have this disgusting story that they've floated around with their
[1:48:28.200 --> 1:48:33.200]  sources at CNN and Buzzfeed that's the way that's one of the six ways or more
[1:48:33.200 --> 1:48:38.880]  that they can come after you isn't it but look at me I mean I'm constantly
[1:48:38.880 --> 1:48:43.600]  trashing our intelligence services with all due respect to you as intelligence
[1:48:43.600 --> 1:48:49.800]  people because you have not kept up with the times now Donald Trump is
[1:48:49.800 --> 1:48:55.680]  president-elect he can protect himself what about me I'm sitting alone and in a
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:49:00.280]  home in the country what do you think could happen to me in all seriousness do
[1:49:00.280 --> 1:49:05.960]  you think that just because we are in America that people are not disappeared
[1:49:05.960 --> 1:49:10.080]  oh yeah it's all for suicide oh absolutely or insanity or God knows
[1:49:10.080 --> 1:49:18.960]  what and yet I am speaking out because I love this country I am the prototypical
[1:49:18.960 --> 1:49:25.240]  patriot I am the embodiment of the American dream if there's nobody if
[1:49:25.240 --> 1:49:29.760]  there's someone more patriotic than me tell me and if anyone believes I am not
[1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:35.320]  then you come to my door and tell me to my face that I am not a patriot please
[1:49:35.320 --> 1:49:39.840]  absolutely I am it takes a lot of guts to do what you did and you stood up and
[1:49:39.840 --> 1:49:44.360]  you spoke out as you point out you don't have the the protection of many
[1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:49.480]  politicians you you've got a new website it's mgtci.com what is that John
[1:49:49.480 --> 1:49:58.320]  people mgt is the the state of the art new security system the old paradigm of
[1:49:58.320 --> 1:50:04.160]  anti-borrow software is dead I created it I should know the reason we have had
[1:50:04.160 --> 1:50:10.240]  all of these hacks with the the Office of Personnel Management the FBI
[1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:14.800]  Homeland Security they were all protected by the by the state of the art
[1:50:14.800 --> 1:50:21.280]  software and it didn't help at MGT we are developing a new paradigm that will
[1:50:21.280 --> 1:50:26.400]  in fact give protection not just to the average American but to the American
[1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:30.640]  government as well that's very important because as you're just saying as an
[1:50:30.640 --> 1:50:34.680]  individual patriot you are at risk not just Donald Trump but you're at risk
[1:50:34.680 --> 1:50:38.800]  also and you know everybody is at risk for being hacked everybody is at risk
[1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:43.400]  for having their identity stolen for having false information planted about
[1:50:43.400 --> 1:50:46.200]  them so that's something everybody should be concerned about they can find out
[1:50:46.200 --> 1:50:51.480]  more about that at MGTCI.com thank you so much John McAfee thank you really are

[1:54:04.840 --> 1:54:09.080]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we're going to play
[1:54:09.080 --> 1:54:15.200]  you some clips about how Donald Trump stood up to the fake news here as the
[1:54:15.200 --> 1:54:22.080]  news press conference began we had Pence vice president like Pence say you
[1:54:22.080 --> 1:54:26.240]  know we were going to talk to you about some conflict of interest issues that
[1:54:26.240 --> 1:54:29.040]  are very important because that's going to be another way that they're going to
[1:54:29.040 --> 1:54:32.920]  attack Donald Trump but of course in the final days just days before Donald
[1:54:32.920 --> 1:54:36.400]  Trump becomes president just hours before the press conference we're going to
[1:54:36.400 --> 1:54:39.760]  talk to you about this complicated situation with conflict of interest
[1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:43.160]  because you know what Donald Trump isn't a community organizer he actually did
[1:54:43.160 --> 1:54:46.960]  things in his life he's actually got a lot of businesses a lot of diverse
[1:54:46.960 --> 1:54:51.760]  businesses that you just can't roll into some kind of a entity and then shovel
[1:54:51.760 --> 1:54:55.520]  it off to somebody else so it's a very complicated situation he's trying to do
[1:54:55.520 --> 1:54:59.000]  the best that he can I think he has a very good response that we're going to
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:02.440]  play you some information about how they're going to handle that as well but
[1:55:02.440 --> 1:55:07.880]  that is what they dumped on Donald Trump as this press conference was coming out
[1:55:07.880 --> 1:55:10.640]  that was the original tension of the press conference I'm sure just hours
[1:55:10.640 --> 1:55:16.160]  before they dump out this disgusting fake news story and WikiLeaks has some
[1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:20.400]  excellent tweets about it showing just how phony it is they said look we've been
[1:55:20.400 --> 1:55:24.360]  a hundred percent right and what we have reported this is a dodgy dossier and
[1:55:24.360 --> 1:55:28.720]  it's absolute phony information so we're going to play you Donald Trump standing
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:33.120]  up getting pretty can testy with CNN we'll be playing that throughout the
[1:55:33.120 --> 1:55:38.040]  next hour real quickly as Alex Jones pointed out when he called in I've been
[1:55:38.040 --> 1:55:43.040]  attacked directly now by media matters for telling you that you ought to protect
[1:55:43.040 --> 1:55:48.080]  yourself with our nanotechnology body armor something that you could even put
[1:55:48.080 --> 1:55:50.720]  in your backpack it's small enough light enough that you could put that in your
[1:55:50.720 --> 1:55:53.720]  backpack when you travel you put in the backpack of your children when they're
[1:55:53.720 --> 1:55:58.160]  going into another gun-free zone in schools by pointing out that several
[1:55:58.160 --> 1:56:01.960]  days before this happened there was the Florida legislature introduced a bill
[1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:06.920]  to allow people to protect themselves after they have been vetted by the
[1:56:06.920 --> 1:56:11.800]  government and allowed to carry basically even turning your constitutional
[1:56:11.800 --> 1:56:14.240]  rights into a government granted privilege even that's not good enough for
[1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:17.280]  the gun control and advocates and they point out look we have these killing
[1:56:17.280 --> 1:56:21.680]  zones we call gun-free zones or schools or airports and then within a couple of
[1:56:21.680 --> 1:56:26.640]  days this happens but of course a meteorite and rather media matters and
[1:56:26.640 --> 1:56:30.480]  these other people are going to attack the people who are saying we ought to be
[1:56:30.480 --> 1:56:33.560]  allowed to protect ourselves so if they got gonna allow you to carry a gun you
[1:56:33.560 --> 1:56:37.640]  ought to at least be able to have this kind of body armor to protect yourself
[1:56:37.640 --> 1:56:41.840]  and a passive way how was anybody hurt by carrying body armor I would ask that to
[1:56:41.840 --> 1:56:46.400]  media matters how does that hurt anyone it just keeps you from being able to
[1:56:46.400 --> 1:56:50.360]  kill me as easily so that's very important it's only one-quarter inch thick
[1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:54.200]  the body armors feel tested confirmed to stop the most powerful pistol rounds

[2:00:48.360 --> 2:00:53.160]  you some clips from Donald Trump's very testy press conference that was held
[2:00:53.160 --> 2:00:58.720]  or earlier today and very testy with good reason he had reason to be very
[2:00:58.720 --> 2:01:03.640]  angry with what the filth that they just dropped on him hours before the press
[2:01:03.640 --> 2:01:07.080]  conference where he was going to talk about how they were going to handle any
[2:01:07.080 --> 2:01:11.880]  concerns about a conflict of interest and of course WikiLeaks has put this out
[2:01:11.880 --> 2:01:16.080]  I want to give you an excerpt from this this is tweeted out by WikiLeaks I said
[2:01:16.080 --> 2:01:20.200]  here's an excerpt from the pseudo intelligence report that was leaked quote
[2:01:20.200 --> 2:01:24.960]  unquote to Buzzfeed who published it just ahead of Trump's press conference
[2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:29.320]  and this is the excerpt that they pulled out of the so-called intelligence
[2:01:29.320 --> 2:01:33.600]  report they say finally regarding Trump's claimed minimal investment profile in
[2:01:33.600 --> 2:01:36.920]  Russia a separate source with direct knowledge said that this had not been for
[2:01:36.920 --> 2:01:41.040]  want of trying Trump's previous efforts that include exploring the real estate
[2:01:41.040 --> 2:01:44.760]  sector in st. Petersburg as well as Moscow but in the end Trump and this is
[2:01:44.760 --> 2:01:49.280]  Trump and all uppercase had had to settle for the use of extensive sexual
[2:01:49.280 --> 2:01:53.400]  services there from local prostitutes rather than business success that's
[2:01:53.400 --> 2:01:57.280]  their so-called intelligence report so I say yeah he's going there but he he
[2:01:57.280 --> 2:02:00.240]  couldn't make any business deals so in the end he just had to settle for
[2:02:00.240 --> 2:02:05.520]  services from local prostitutes what a joke and WikiLeaks points out we have
[2:02:05.520 --> 2:02:10.240]  been 100% accurate and they have been nobody has ever questioned the
[2:02:10.240 --> 2:02:14.800]  information that WikiLeaks put out from the DNC from Podesta's emails the
[2:02:14.800 --> 2:02:17.320]  information about Hillary Clinton or any of these people nobody has ever
[2:02:17.320 --> 2:02:21.600]  questioned the veracity of that the accuracy of that instead they have tried
[2:02:21.600 --> 2:02:26.640]  to divert people's attention from it with looking at who did this oh I think
[2:02:26.640 --> 2:02:30.520]  the Russians did it bad guys did this it's like you're just making the Russians
[2:02:30.520 --> 2:02:34.800]  look good when you say that sorry Lindsey Graham but they are whoever released
[2:02:34.800 --> 2:02:38.800]  the truth about Hillary Clinton did everyone a favor on it but as they
[2:02:38.800 --> 2:02:43.040]  pointed out you know nobody ever questioned the authenticity of the
[2:02:43.040 --> 2:02:46.720]  information they just tried to divert attention from it as they always do when
[2:02:46.720 --> 2:02:52.360]  whistleblowers leak crimes out there but this is absolute total garbage and it's
[2:02:52.360 --> 2:02:57.160]  coming from people who earlier today we saw Daily Caller said BuzzFeed editors
[2:02:57.160 --> 2:03:01.520]  were crying during Obama's speech yesterday he gave this long torturous
[2:03:01.520 --> 2:03:05.760]  farewell speech he just couldn't get off the stage and drudge report has it up
[2:03:05.760 --> 2:03:09.280]  there I think it was what it's 75 times or something it went 75 minutes long and
[2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:14.280]  I forget how many times he referred to himself it was all about him okay and
[2:03:14.280 --> 2:03:20.120]  that's the the the Obama but we've got the BuzzFeed editors who absolutely
[2:03:20.120 --> 2:03:23.520]  dearly love Obama and Hillary Clinton they tweeted they were crying as Barack
[2:03:23.520 --> 2:03:26.840]  Obama delivered his farewell address there's just a few hours after they
[2:03:26.840 --> 2:03:30.880]  published an unverified report by an alleged former British spy they claim
[2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:34.400]  that president-elect had performed lewd acts with prostitutes here's some of the
[2:03:34.400 --> 2:03:38.360]  things they said BuzzFeed senior editor Lara Parker tweeted will I ever stop
[2:03:38.360 --> 2:03:43.640]  crying another one Tanya Tanya Chen an editor at the outlet tweeted I'm crying
[2:03:43.640 --> 2:03:48.800]  this is the saddest series finale shown ever on television another one Alameem
[2:03:48.800 --> 2:03:54.920]  Abdel Mahmoud wrote and tears another one Jessica Lima BuzzFeed Spanish editor
[2:03:54.920 --> 2:03:59.520]  tweeted yep I'm crying I can't stop besides executive editor said that he
[2:03:59.520 --> 2:04:04.280]  hadn't cried as much as he did during the tour since Beyoncé's recent tour
[2:04:04.280 --> 2:04:08.560]  I guess so why would you cry Beyoncé's tour I don't know maybe it's the music I
[2:04:08.560 --> 2:04:11.800]  guess if I actually listen to her I'd bring tears from my ears eyes for a
[2:04:11.800 --> 2:04:16.680]  different reason this is these are the people that did this and of course Buzz
[2:04:16.680 --> 2:04:24.000]  Feed is really nothing but CNN has just burned to a crisp any last shred of
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:27.440]  respectability that that phony network has had we've been showing you for years
[2:04:27.440 --> 2:04:34.200]  how they faked attacks during the first Iraq war how they faked being on site
[2:04:34.200 --> 2:04:39.640]  at the Sandy Hook shooting and so forth a disappearing nose of Anderson Cooper
[2:04:39.640 --> 2:04:44.120]  who used to work for the CIA we always called him the CIA network the Clinton
[2:04:44.120 --> 2:04:48.480]  News Network that is exactly what they are folks when we come back we're gonna
[2:04:48.480 --> 2:04:52.080]  play you some clips from the press conference today with video with Donald
[2:04:52.080 --> 2:04:57.400]  Trump he came down on both the intelligence services and CNN who works
[2:04:57.400 --> 2:05:01.480]  for them we'll be right back the telegraph is reporting that Barack Obama's
[2:05:01.480 --> 2:05:05.800]  farewell speech included remarks about his leadership with an urgent and
[2:05:05.800 --> 2:05:09.400]  fearful warning about the state of American democracy a warning that
[2:05:09.400 --> 2:05:13.280]  resonated eerily similar to the one that George Soros gave shortly after
[2:05:13.280 --> 2:05:17.000]  Trump won the election the telegraph is saying it's because of his speech on
[2:05:17.000 --> 2:05:19.880]  Tuesday night that's even more remarkable than anything he's done in the
[2:05:19.880 --> 2:05:23.040]  past eight years and he was preaching change and hope throughout those eight
[2:05:23.040 --> 2:05:26.360]  years he's now ending his quote leadership with an urgent warning about
[2:05:26.360 --> 2:05:29.480]  the state of American democracy and affairs one writer says it was a
[2:05:29.480 --> 2:05:33.440]  thinly veiled slate to a divisive rhetoric Donald Trump's election campaign
[2:05:33.440 --> 2:05:37.640]  which included attacks on Muslims the disabled women and immigrants what new
[2:05:37.640 --> 2:05:42.800]  source are they looking at CNN on what planet did Donald Trump attack any of
[2:05:42.800 --> 2:05:47.040]  those anyway mr. Obama went on to say if we don't create opportunity for all
[2:05:47.040 --> 2:05:50.640]  people the disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only
[2:05:50.640 --> 2:05:55.480]  sharpen in years to come goodbye mr. Obama and farewell oh and thanks for the

[2:08:08.560 --> 2:08:12.240]  lines of the info war
[2:08:12.240 --> 2:08:19.920]  back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we have had an amazing news
[2:08:19.920 --> 2:08:23.240]  day today just hours before Donald Trump is going to talk about how he's going to
[2:08:23.240 --> 2:08:27.680]  handle the conflict of interest attacks being made on him by Elizabeth Warren
[2:08:27.680 --> 2:08:31.040]  and Nancy Pelosi and how that was going to escalate he has a very good plan I
[2:08:31.040 --> 2:08:35.200]  believe for handling it and he had a lady who broke this down who put the
[2:08:35.200 --> 2:08:38.760]  plan together for him but just hours before that happened just days before
[2:08:38.760 --> 2:08:45.440]  he becomes president this filth at Buzzfeed drops a load of filth on the
[2:08:45.440 --> 2:08:51.440]  nation a load of lies and of course it was trumpeted by CNN and John McCain
[2:08:51.440 --> 2:08:55.840]  jumped in and wanted to take credit for it too so we'll give you credit John and
[2:08:55.840 --> 2:09:00.680]  we'll let people see this and see that you're part of this and this should be
[2:09:00.680 --> 2:09:06.880]  an end to any shred of credibility that you and CNN are hanging on to this
[2:09:06.880 --> 2:09:11.600]  should be the end of it for John McCain absolutely disgusting that he would jump
[2:09:11.600 --> 2:09:16.240]  in on this and of course people on Fortran were saying like the the idea
[2:09:16.240 --> 2:09:19.720]  that the Russians had something on Donald Trump has been floating around for a
[2:09:19.720 --> 2:09:23.560]  long time but Fortran said hey we put together the specifics of this story and
[2:09:23.560 --> 2:09:28.320]  we fed this out and and it was actually a troll and Buzzfeed picked up on it but
[2:09:28.320 --> 2:09:33.520]  I want to go to what Donald Trump said at the press conference he said this kind
[2:09:33.520 --> 2:09:39.680]  of fake news actually destroys lives let's play that clip you know I've been
[2:09:39.680 --> 2:09:42.320]  hearing more and more about a thing called fake news and they're talking
[2:09:42.320 --> 2:09:46.560]  about people to go and say all sorts of things but I will tell you some of the
[2:09:46.560 --> 2:09:50.920]  media outlets that I deal with a fake news more so than anybody I could name
[2:09:50.920 --> 2:09:55.960]  them but I won't bother but you have few sitting right in front of us so they're
[2:09:55.960 --> 2:10:00.720]  very very dishonest people but I think we're just something we're gonna have to
[2:10:00.720 --> 2:10:06.200]  live with I guess the advantage I have is that I can speak back when it happens
[2:10:06.200 --> 2:10:10.680]  to somebody that doesn't have this doesn't have that kind of a megaphone
[2:10:10.680 --> 2:10:15.240]  they can't speak back it's a very sad thing I've seen people destroyed I've
[2:10:15.240 --> 2:10:20.760]  seen people absolutely destroyed and I think it's very unfair so all I can ask
[2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:27.000]  for is honest reporters yes and you know when the people that they threw his
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:30.880]  name around was Michael Cohen and they said well wait a minute he's never even
[2:10:30.880 --> 2:10:35.040]  been to Prague where this supposedly took place here's his passport he tweeted
[2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:38.760]  that out he said I've never been there I was in California at the time this
[2:10:38.760 --> 2:10:42.920]  happened so I mean it's it's a very they didn't bother folks to check on
[2:10:42.920 --> 2:10:46.800]  anything didn't bother to check on anything of course you're always getting
[2:10:46.800 --> 2:10:52.440]  stuff in as a news media organization always getting stuff sent to you a lot
[2:10:52.440 --> 2:10:56.240]  of it is deliberate trolling and a lot of it is people that are mistaken and you
[2:10:56.240 --> 2:10:59.760]  have to check the information on that but of course they don't and they don't
[2:10:59.760 --> 2:11:02.720]  want to be called on it you know we've gone in just a couple of days we've
[2:11:02.720 --> 2:11:06.720]  gone from the fake awards ceremony that they call the Golden Globes and if you
[2:11:06.720 --> 2:11:10.520]  don't realize just how fake the Golden Globes is take a look at what Gary
[2:11:10.520 --> 2:11:14.040]  Oldman has written about in various entertainment publications about what a
[2:11:14.040 --> 2:11:18.680]  contrived piece of nonsense the Golden Globes is you know they say well we're
[2:11:18.680 --> 2:11:21.640]  gonna give such and such an award to somebody but hey if you can't show up
[2:11:21.640 --> 2:11:25.640]  we're gonna give it to somebody else it's about 90 people it's not several
[2:11:25.640 --> 2:11:28.480]  thousand people like they have for the Oscars and of course the Oscars is
[2:11:28.480 --> 2:11:33.440]  nothing but a popularity contest amongst Hollywood it isn't really about this
[2:11:33.440 --> 2:11:37.360]  being better than that you can look at other metrics like the box office but
[2:11:37.360 --> 2:11:42.520]  the Golden Globes is totally phony so phony that the FCC the Federal
[2:11:42.520 --> 2:11:47.560]  Communications Commission actually gave a lot of pressure in past years to NBC
[2:11:47.560 --> 2:11:50.000]  and other people who carried it and kind of scared them from carrying it for
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:54.480]  several years so we've gone from the fake Golden Globes now to the fake Golden
[2:11:54.480 --> 2:12:00.520]  Showers scandal that has been concocted by CNN and Buzzfeed it's just
[2:12:00.520 --> 2:12:05.040]  absolutely amazing before you can debunk one lie they dumped some other trash on
[2:12:05.040 --> 2:12:09.520]  you and this truly is a bunch of trash and as I point out in the last segment
[2:12:09.520 --> 2:12:14.360]  WikiLeaks put up a clip there and said look at how childish this narrative is
[2:12:14.360 --> 2:12:18.920]  it was beyond belief WikiLeaks is used to looking at records they
[2:12:18.920 --> 2:12:22.360]  authenticate records before they put them out they have a as they pointed out a
[2:12:22.360 --> 2:12:27.920]  100% record of accurate authentication and they said we do not endorse but
[2:12:27.920 --> 2:12:33.400]  Buzzfeed's publication of a document which is clearly clearly bogus and we
[2:12:33.400 --> 2:12:37.480]  just had John McAfee on he was talking about how this so-called intelligence
[2:12:37.480 --> 2:12:42.760]  report that is being touted around by his mainstream media still about the
[2:12:42.760 --> 2:12:48.040]  Russians hacked us he said that is clearly bogus it's absolute nonsense if
[2:12:48.040 --> 2:12:51.640]  the people if the circumstantial evidence that's in there from those
[2:12:51.640 --> 2:12:56.080]  intelligence agencies is really true if the Russians really did leave all of
[2:12:56.080 --> 2:13:00.360]  these fingerprints and signatures on it they're more incompetent than the guy
[2:13:00.360 --> 2:13:06.120]  who goes in and robs a bank by writing a give me your money note on his own
[2:13:06.120 --> 2:13:12.760]  personal check okay his own ID I mean that's how stupid that Russians hacked
[2:13:12.760 --> 2:13:16.480]  our elections intelligence report that we got from our so-called intelligence
[2:13:16.480 --> 2:13:20.480]  agencies is it is clearly political they're clearly coming after him
[2:13:20.480 --> 2:13:24.320]  Chucky Schumer said hey don't criticize intelligence agencies because they got
[2:13:24.320 --> 2:13:27.600]  ways to get you and then we see this kind of crap coming out and let's look
[2:13:27.600 --> 2:13:31.200]  at this next clip because they asked Donald Trump directly do you trust the
[2:13:31.200 --> 2:13:34.240]  intelligence agencies here what you here's what he had to say at the press
[2:13:34.240 --> 2:13:39.560]  conference earlier today do you trust your US intelligence officials and what
[2:13:39.560 --> 2:13:44.400]  do you say to foreign policy experts who say you're actually weakening national
[2:13:44.400 --> 2:13:47.720]  security by waging this war of words against that
[2:13:47.720 --> 2:13:53.680]  intelligence agencies are vital and very very important we are going to be
[2:13:53.680 --> 2:13:59.560]  putting in as you know mr. Pompeo and others you know the senator Dan coats
[2:13:59.560 --> 2:14:03.480]  we're going to be putting in some outstanding people within 90 days
[2:14:03.480 --> 2:14:10.320]  they're going to be coming back to me with a major report on hacking I want
[2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:15.320]  them to cover this situation I also want them however to cover maybe most
[2:14:15.320 --> 2:14:20.120]  importantly because we're hacked by everybody that includes Russia and China
[2:14:20.120 --> 2:14:25.000]  and everybody
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:32.760]  you said just now that you believe that Russia indeed was responsible for the
[2:14:32.760 --> 2:14:37.120]  hacking of the DNC and on to this is emails etc but you know what could have
[2:14:37.120 --> 2:14:40.760]  been others also but why did you spend weeks undermining US intelligence
[2:14:40.760 --> 2:14:45.400]  community before simply getting the facts and then making a public I think it's
[2:14:45.400 --> 2:14:49.640]  pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press I think it's
[2:14:49.640 --> 2:14:54.120]  pretty safe first of all it's illegal you know these are these are classified
[2:14:54.120 --> 2:14:59.360]  and certified meetings and reports I'll tell you what does happen I have many
[2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:05.720]  meetings with intelligence and every time I meet people are reading about it
[2:15:05.720 --> 2:15:10.760]  somebody's leaking it out you know that's amazing to see those questions that
[2:15:10.760 --> 2:15:14.680]  are coming out you hear the one question why are you weakening that are vital
[2:15:14.680 --> 2:15:18.200]  intelligence agencies why are you undermining our vital intelligence
[2:15:18.200 --> 2:15:22.600]  agencies who's undermining who it's pretty clear when you look at this where
[2:15:22.600 --> 2:15:25.960]  the undermining direction is coming from it's very politicized and the very
[2:15:25.960 --> 2:15:30.680]  fact that they would leak this report to NBC before they would even show it to
[2:15:30.680 --> 2:15:35.280]  the president-elect tells you that it is all about politics doesn't it it shows
[2:15:35.280 --> 2:15:40.000]  you who is trying to undermine who and the simple fact is these are the same
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:44.720]  reporters who are saying we we shouldn't have so many generals in the Trump
[2:15:44.720 --> 2:15:48.920]  cabinet this is very dangerous we need a civilian government yes we do we do
[2:15:48.920 --> 2:15:51.280]  need civilian leadership we need somebody who is going to have an
[2:15:51.280 --> 2:15:56.040]  independent mind who is going to question the intelligence that he's given who is
[2:15:56.040 --> 2:15:59.120]  going to say well I want to see substantiation for that I really want
[2:15:59.120 --> 2:16:02.080]  another opinion I want a second opinion on that that's precisely what we're
[2:16:02.080 --> 2:16:05.160]  getting with Donald Trump and I'll say this about the generals I said it before
[2:16:05.160 --> 2:16:09.480]  we've had some really fine generals even as president haven't we starting with
[2:16:09.480 --> 2:16:14.800]  general Washington most recently general Eisenhower now just because your
[2:16:14.800 --> 2:16:18.240]  general doesn't make you a great president but it doesn't disqualify you
[2:16:18.240 --> 2:16:23.680]  either you can still be a great leader you learn a lot of things being in
[2:16:23.680 --> 2:16:28.640]  charge of that many people obviously you can have a bad general become president
[2:16:28.640 --> 2:16:32.640]  like Ulysses Grant he had one of the most corrupt administrations we've ever
[2:16:32.640 --> 2:16:36.760]  seen in this country but you can have some very good generals as well and so
[2:16:36.760 --> 2:16:41.480]  when you look at this whole intelligence issue and you look at the way the press
[2:16:41.480 --> 2:16:44.320]  is coming after Donald Trump that's one of the reasons why he hasn't had a press
[2:16:44.320 --> 2:16:48.920]  conference in six months he can get his information out in a way that isn't
[2:16:48.920 --> 2:16:53.120]  slanted with these people but he's also not afraid to take them on directly we
[2:16:53.120 --> 2:16:58.240]  saw that in the last hour we played that clip where he went one-on-one with CNN so
[2:16:58.240 --> 2:17:01.640]  he's not going back down in a live situation he can handle himself there
[2:17:01.640 --> 2:17:05.640]  but they also spend this and the way that they're saying oh why are you
[2:17:05.640 --> 2:17:09.160]  weakening our intelligence agency why are you undermining our intelligence
[2:17:09.160 --> 2:17:13.880]  agency when it's the intelligence agencies that are being set up as a dark
[2:17:13.880 --> 2:17:18.040]  government that doesn't have to answer to anybody a perpetual government that
[2:17:18.040 --> 2:17:22.680]  persists from administration to administration that has its own hidden
[2:17:22.680 --> 2:17:27.200]  agenda that has its own hidden way of financing itself through a global drug
[2:17:27.200 --> 2:17:30.720]  war I mean we need to call these people out on what they've been doing for a
[2:17:30.720 --> 2:17:34.680]  very long time and I'm quite frankly and a lot of us are very sick about what we
[2:17:34.680 --> 2:17:38.760]  seen from the CIA and these other organizations that have been doing this
[2:17:38.760 --> 2:17:42.960]  and we are quite sick about the lies we're fed with the weapons of mass
[2:17:42.960 --> 2:17:48.880]  destruction intelligence that came to us unanimously from all of these 16 17 now
[2:17:48.880 --> 2:17:54.080]  17 intelligence agencies and so consensus doesn't mean anything it doesn't
[2:17:54.080 --> 2:17:57.440]  mean that you're right there was a consensus that Neville Chamberlain heard
[2:17:57.440 --> 2:18:01.080]  from his intelligence agency as I point out in the last hour about Adolf Hitler
[2:18:01.080 --> 2:18:04.320]  that was absolutely wrong Winston Churchill had his own intelligence
[2:18:04.320 --> 2:18:08.480]  network and he knew what was going on there and of course Winston Churchill is
[2:18:08.480 --> 2:18:12.280]  now as I point out part of the Trump transition team he will be coming back
[2:18:12.280 --> 2:18:18.640]  into the Oval Office as a bust and so it's a Churchill or bust coming back in
[2:18:18.640 --> 2:18:22.080]  so let's take a look at another thing that they talked about on the press
[2:18:22.080 --> 2:18:27.080]  conference we had a back-and-forth about whether or not Mexico is gonna pay for
[2:18:27.080 --> 2:18:31.200]  the wall let's hear what Donald Trump had to say about that I would say we are
[2:18:31.200 --> 2:18:36.360]  going to build a wall and people would go crazy I would then say who's gonna pay
[2:18:36.360 --> 2:18:41.400]  for the wall and people would all scream out 25 30,000 people because nobody's
[2:18:41.400 --> 2:18:45.200]  ever had crowds like Trump has had you know that you don't like to report that
[2:18:45.200 --> 2:18:51.240]  but that's okay okay now he agrees finally he agrees but I say who's gonna
[2:18:51.240 --> 2:18:57.600]  pay for the wall and they will scream out Mexico now reports went out last week
[2:18:57.600 --> 2:19:01.320]  oh Mexico is not going to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement what's
[2:19:01.320 --> 2:19:05.560]  the difference I want to get the wall started I don't want to wait a year and
[2:19:05.560 --> 2:19:09.880]  a half until I make my deal with Mexico so and we probably will have a deal
[2:19:09.880 --> 2:19:15.440]  sooner than that and by the way Mexico has been so nice so nice I respect the
[2:19:15.440 --> 2:19:19.400]  government of Mexico I respect the people of Mexico I love the people of
[2:19:19.400 --> 2:19:23.960]  Mexico many people from Mexico working for me they're phenomenal people the
[2:19:23.960 --> 2:19:29.680]  government of Mexico is terrific I don't blame them for what's happened I don't
[2:19:29.680 --> 2:19:34.760]  blame them for taking advantage of the United States I wish our politicians
[2:19:34.760 --> 2:19:41.880]  were so smart Mexico has taken advantage of the United States I don't blame the
[2:19:41.880 --> 2:19:48.360]  representatives and various presidents etc of Mexico what I say is we shouldn't
[2:19:48.360 --> 2:19:52.520]  have allowed that to happen it's not gonna happen anymore so in order to get
[2:19:52.520 --> 2:19:58.480]  the wall started Mexico will pay for the wall but it'll be reimbursed and you
[2:19:58.480 --> 2:20:01.480]  know how is that gonna be reimbursed stay with me right back if you woke up

[2:24:18.640 --> 2:24:22.840]  this point we're witnessing as I told you history on top of history on top of
[2:24:22.840 --> 2:24:28.240]  history this is a quickening time for good and evil and you see the evil MSM
[2:24:28.240 --> 2:24:34.480]  a BuzzFeed and CNN the dying dinosaurs desperately grabbing on this
[2:24:34.480 --> 2:24:38.200]  internet line that's been out there that I've seen for over a year mixing in with
[2:24:38.200 --> 2:24:42.520]  some new dates biting on it and then having intelligence agencies say oh
[2:24:42.520 --> 2:24:46.480]  yeah yeah it's real go with it because they still believe they have a monopoly
[2:24:46.480 --> 2:24:50.400]  of power they still believe they're operating with air superiority in the
[2:24:50.400 --> 2:24:55.720]  media with no one able to challenge them and then here comes Trump not bowing to
[2:24:55.720 --> 2:24:59.480]  him not scared of him not going under a rock but saying you're not real media
[2:24:59.480 --> 2:25:05.000]  you're a fraud you're a joke and you can see them going into total and complete
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:11.160]  panic mode these latest events are 20 times bigger than the lies about WMD's
[2:25:11.160 --> 2:25:15.240]  Iraq because those came out years later the whole media was involved basically
[2:25:15.240 --> 2:25:20.800]  so they can kind of distribute the blame over a large group and just kind of
[2:25:20.800 --> 2:25:25.320]  hide that was the beginning of the fall now you're seeing what was left little
[2:25:25.320 --> 2:25:34.320]  crumbs dissipating into dust this is history happening we are seeing a
[2:25:34.320 --> 2:25:38.760]  corrupt disconnected elite that believes they're invincible because they didn't
[2:25:38.760 --> 2:25:43.320]  earn their power they stole it so they're they didn't come from nothing they
[2:25:43.320 --> 2:25:47.040]  didn't come up from the street just like so many other elites they were giving it
[2:25:47.040 --> 2:25:54.000]  and so they've just got giant gaping holes in their logic in their analysis
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:59.600]  in their strategy in their stratagems they don't understand that we don't
[2:25:59.600 --> 2:26:05.240]  care about ego or any of it we're about winning and defeating them and we're
[2:26:05.240 --> 2:26:08.800]  never gonna stop coming and it's good to see them go for being completely
[2:26:08.800 --> 2:26:14.400]  arrogant to being horrified no because now they're just panicked and running
[2:26:14.400 --> 2:26:20.560]  around in different directions like craze chickens on fire I liken it to
[2:26:20.560 --> 2:26:24.320]  what exterminators talk about when they go into a house when they spray for
[2:26:24.320 --> 2:26:31.000]  roaches when they're being poisoned for about an hour they'll run around insane
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:35.400]  high on it and start having sex because it's their last instinct is to
[2:26:35.400 --> 2:26:40.000]  procreate before they roll over and die and I just love to see them blame Trump
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:46.280]  everything they're into it is true projection at its finest and I can't
[2:26:46.280 --> 2:26:50.760]  get targets psychosis though watching them burn on the horizon like ships on
[2:26:50.760 --> 2:26:55.960]  fire we don't get too focused on the fire and turn into pillars of salt here as
[2:26:55.960 --> 2:26:59.480]  we look back on Sodom and Gomorrah we just have to realize that these are
[2:26:59.480 --> 2:27:04.200]  truly despicable scumbags and they will always be disdain that their names will
[2:27:04.200 --> 2:27:10.560]  be an absolutely connected to failure and evil and treachery they are the
[2:27:10.560 --> 2:27:13.920]  scumbag of the earth they are the mercenary media they are the filth they
[2:27:13.920 --> 2:27:17.920]  are the dishonored and I've got so much more to break down but Trump is

[2:32:59.040 --> 2:33:25.600]  the last voice memo I made the point I want to make it absolutely crystal clear
[2:33:25.600 --> 2:33:30.040]  because it's the key to everything and why we're defeating the enemy the globalists
[2:33:30.040 --> 2:33:34.000]  have no natural defense to resistance they've been operating with total air
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:39.280]  superiority with no one challenging them no one to call them on their BS now
[2:33:39.280 --> 2:33:43.480]  because they're beginning to get called on things that are so discredited they
[2:33:43.480 --> 2:33:47.960]  want to shut down their competition that only proves to everyone that they're
[2:33:47.960 --> 2:33:52.840]  absolute complete and total frauds and now with each successive fake news
[2:33:52.840 --> 2:33:56.480]  story they get caught in they only intensify the next level of a lot
[2:33:56.480 --> 2:33:59.920]  desperately like a gambler or like a heroin addict wanting a bigger
[2:33:59.920 --> 2:34:04.240]  injection hoping hoping that the great days come back of their delusional
[2:34:04.240 --> 2:34:09.480]  narcissism that's why Trump's so key he's a champion that doesn't care what they
[2:34:09.480 --> 2:34:13.560]  say who's confident that shows they're a joke who's already broken their will
[2:34:13.560 --> 2:34:18.560]  with the people by being elected against everything they had thrown at him so
[2:34:18.560 --> 2:34:21.520]  they go from the racist claims to the homophobe claims the Russian agent
[2:34:21.520 --> 2:34:27.920]  claims to now peagate next they'll be saying you know he's cannibalizing
[2:34:27.920 --> 2:34:32.040]  children or he's on an airplane with a pedophile like Bill Clinton really is it's
[2:34:32.040 --> 2:34:37.040]  not gonna work it's all a fraud the truth is Trump is totally fastidious a
[2:34:37.040 --> 2:34:42.000]  germaphobe the complete opposite of somebody that would ever even do
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:44.360]  something like this but we all know it's fake it's been out for over a year
[2:34:44.360 --> 2:34:47.320]  in fact last night when I saw it I thought wait I've seen this before this
[2:34:47.320 --> 2:34:50.560]  is fake and I didn't even report on it to counter it because I didn't want to
[2:34:50.560 --> 2:34:55.400]  promote it just as it felt wrong but I guess I probably should have just piled
[2:34:55.400 --> 2:34:59.680]  on because it's such an incredible victory these people are a joke and I'm
[2:34:59.680 --> 2:35:01.920]  not into just celebrating things to celebrate things but let me tell you
[2:35:01.920 --> 2:35:05.560]  we ought to celebrate all the wrong moves they've made and how pathetic they
[2:35:05.560 --> 2:35:10.920]  are because these are true reprobates scum that again their whole religion is
[2:35:10.920 --> 2:35:17.800]  they're better than us CNN MSNBC reporters they are trash they are
[2:35:17.800 --> 2:35:21.320]  arrogant people with chips on their shoulders who basically hate their
[2:35:21.320 --> 2:35:25.480]  fellow humans and you look at Casparian and sinker and all them when they you
[2:35:25.480 --> 2:35:29.320]  know lost an election night all pissed freaking out it's because their whole
[2:35:29.320 --> 2:35:33.280]  identity is in their false lie this is who they are they want to be the ruling
[2:35:33.280 --> 2:35:36.800]  class but no one in the real world would even want to hang out with them or
[2:35:36.800 --> 2:35:42.760]  know them from racial mad out of Wolf Blitzer to to all these people they're
[2:35:42.760 --> 2:35:47.720]  just despicable jokes and they've had the elite behind them they've had the
[2:35:47.720 --> 2:35:51.240]  big robber bear and money for a hundred years funding and creating MSM and the
[2:35:51.240 --> 2:35:54.960]  bigger they are the harder they fall and we're seeing the collapse accelerate
[2:35:54.960 --> 2:35:59.360]  this is a beautiful beautiful time and Donald Trump is a bellwether of all of
[2:35:59.360 --> 2:36:03.400]  this the problem is we got eight and a half nine days left and who knows what
[2:36:03.400 --> 2:36:06.280]  they're gonna pull before then so we're in very very positive territory but we've
[2:36:06.280 --> 2:36:11.520]  all got to have our eyes peeled our ears up and our heads down watching and but
[2:36:11.520 --> 2:36:15.120]  also spreading the word in the end for an intensifying operations this is
[2:36:15.120 --> 2:36:19.960]  history this is 1776 worldwide now back to David Knight you know we talked about
[2:36:19.960 --> 2:36:23.680]  Donald Trump in the press conference coming out directly and saying fake news
[2:36:23.680 --> 2:36:26.960]  actually has consequences folks that destroys life well that's what it was
[2:36:26.960 --> 2:36:31.560]  intended to do was intended to destroy lives and we need to remember the old
[2:36:31.560 --> 2:36:35.080]  saying I think it was maybe originally Gandhi that said it that first they
[2:36:35.080 --> 2:36:38.040]  assassinate your character then they assassinate you I mean that's the whole
[2:36:38.040 --> 2:36:42.000]  point they want to destroy your life literally destroy your life but first
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:45.800]  they start out by destroying your character and so in that vein we have
[2:36:45.800 --> 2:36:49.840]  John McCain coming out this is a headline from Daily Mail it was me he says
[2:36:49.840 --> 2:36:55.400]  and they say sworn Trump enemy John McCain admits that he handed the smear
[2:36:55.400 --> 2:37:00.720]  dossier out okay this is the guy and of course Drudge has a picture John McCain
[2:37:00.720 --> 2:37:03.960]  that they shot when he was running for president they lit him from below they
[2:37:03.960 --> 2:37:07.240]  look like this sinister villain from a horror film or whatever actually the
[2:37:07.240 --> 2:37:14.320]  guy is an actual caricature of Dr. Strange Love I mean he gets this kick out
[2:37:14.320 --> 2:37:18.480]  of talking about war you can just see it he gets it gets a rush when he talks
[2:37:18.480 --> 2:37:22.360]  about it he says everything about him except the fact he's not in a wheelchair
[2:37:22.360 --> 2:37:27.680]  is just like Dr. Strange Love I mean this guy is truly dangerous and I hope
[2:37:27.680 --> 2:37:32.400]  that he has jumped the shark finally with this and taking credit for it even I
[2:37:32.400 --> 2:37:35.640]  mean this is absolutely amazing before we go back and play one of these other
[2:37:35.640 --> 2:37:39.560]  clips where Donald Trump takes on the fake news takes on CNN directly I want
[2:37:39.560 --> 2:37:43.880]  to play it for you again we played it in the last hour very good clip when he was
[2:37:43.880 --> 2:37:47.840]  talking about making Mexico pay for the wall the press keeps coming back to me
[2:37:47.840 --> 2:37:50.400]  you can't make them pay for the wall they say they're not gonna pay for the wall
[2:37:50.400 --> 2:37:55.000]  look there are ways to make them pay now it is in Mexico's interest to make
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:37:58.480]  things difficult for the drug cartels to operate so it'd be in their interest to
[2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:01.840]  have a wall it'd be in the interest of even the Hispanics who have moved into
[2:38:01.840 --> 2:38:06.280]  this country legally to have a wall because it protects them from these
[2:38:06.280 --> 2:38:09.320]  violent gangs that are free to go across the border back and forth you know
[2:38:09.320 --> 2:38:13.120]  and there was a story earlier today on the dredge report US Border Patrol is
[2:38:13.120 --> 2:38:17.920]  recruiting wild horses to now patrol the border that'll be a change you know
[2:38:17.920 --> 2:38:22.960]  because under Obama the border patrol not even wild horses could drag them to
[2:38:22.960 --> 2:38:27.000]  patrol the border you know we had Obama there you know as the the immigrant
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:30.840]  whisperer I guess we should say the the foreign citizen whisperer come on come
[2:38:30.840 --> 2:38:34.360]  on we'll give you benefits come across the border border patrol you're not
[2:38:34.360 --> 2:38:36.960]  allowed to go there and border patrol was not happy about that it's first time
[2:38:36.960 --> 2:38:41.560]  to ever endorsed a presidential candidate the border patrol union was very
[2:38:41.560 --> 2:38:45.480]  outspoken about the fact that Obama had prevented them from doing their jobs and
[2:38:45.480 --> 2:38:48.120]  they were very outspoken about their support for Donald Trump they want to
[2:38:48.120 --> 2:38:51.960]  do their job and they're going to do their job and there is going to be a
[2:38:51.960 --> 2:38:54.760]  wall and there are ways to make them pay for it if they want don't want to pay
[2:38:54.760 --> 2:38:59.640]  for it directly they can pay for it by what happens with NAFTA and a
[2:38:59.640 --> 2:39:03.560]  renegotiation or just termination of that agreement it can be terminated
[2:39:03.560 --> 2:39:07.120]  directly by Donald Trump if they want to renegotiate it it'll have to be
[2:39:07.120 --> 2:39:10.520]  involved with a larger group of people the Senate will have to in the House will
[2:39:10.520 --> 2:39:14.920]  have to get involved in that but he can terminate that agreement with notice and
[2:39:14.920 --> 2:39:17.680]  it's I forget what the time was it's something like six months agree
[2:39:17.680 --> 2:39:21.360]  notification or something like that but of course they've been making 60 to 75
[2:39:21.360 --> 2:39:28.160]  billion dollars a year in recent years every year in a trade deficit so if you
[2:39:28.160 --> 2:39:31.640]  take that away from them that's one way that they can pay for the wall let's go
[2:39:31.640 --> 2:39:35.720]  back though to this clip that we have from the press conference earlier day
[2:39:35.720 --> 2:39:42.320]  where Donald Trump called out CNN as being the leaders of fake news maybe
[2:39:42.320 --> 2:39:46.440]  that should be their new tagline CNN we lead the world in fake news here's that
[2:39:46.440 --> 2:39:53.080]  clip information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the
[2:39:53.080 --> 2:40:00.240]  public as far as Buzzfeed which is a failing pile of garbage writing it I
[2:40:00.240 --> 2:40:04.240]  think they're gonna suffer the consequences they already are and as far
[2:40:04.240 --> 2:40:09.800]  as CNN going out of their way to build it up and by the way we just found out I
[2:40:09.800 --> 2:40:13.160]  was coming down Michael Cohn I was being come Michael Cohn is a very talented
[2:40:13.160 --> 2:40:16.680]  lawyer is a good lawyer in my firm who's just reported that it wasn't this
[2:40:16.680 --> 2:40:21.160]  Michael Cohn they were talking about so all night long it's Michael Cohn I said
[2:40:21.160 --> 2:40:25.680]  I want to see your passport he brings his passport to my office I say hey
[2:40:25.680 --> 2:40:29.040]  wait a minute he didn't leave the country he wasn't out of the country they had
[2:40:29.040 --> 2:40:33.680]  Michael Cohn of the Trump Organization wasn't proud it turned out to be a
[2:40:33.680 --> 2:40:38.320]  different Michael Cohn it's a disgrace what took place it's a disgrace and I
[2:40:38.320 --> 2:40:41.680]  think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohn
[2:40:41.680 --> 2:40:50.560]  n
[2:40:50.560 --> 2:40:54.480]  organization you are attacking our news organization get a chance to ask the
[2:40:54.480 --> 2:40:58.600]  question sir sir quiet this president like go ahead do you think can you say
[2:40:58.600 --> 2:41:04.120]  question don't be rude don't be rude can you give us a question don't be
[2:41:04.120 --> 2:41:05.800]  We're not going to give you a question.
[2:41:05.800 --> 2:41:07.320]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[2:41:07.320 --> 2:41:08.320]  Can you state how to do it?
[2:41:08.320 --> 2:41:09.320]  You are fake news.
[2:41:09.320 --> 2:41:10.320]  Sir.
[2:41:10.320 --> 2:41:12.160]  That's just it.
[2:41:12.160 --> 2:41:15.280]  They're demanding and telling him what he's going to do.
[2:41:15.280 --> 2:41:17.640]  No, CNN, you're not president.
[2:41:17.640 --> 2:41:19.240]  You don't control this.
[2:41:19.240 --> 2:41:20.240]  Get this through your head.
[2:41:20.240 --> 2:41:22.960]  Donald Trump is in control and he made it very clear there.
[2:41:22.960 --> 2:41:27.160]  If you're going to come out and make yourself into a propaganda organization for certain
[2:41:27.160 --> 2:41:31.920]  clicks within the CIA and intelligence services, if you're going to be the propagator of fake
[2:41:31.920 --> 2:41:35.600]  news, you're not going to get to ask questions at a press conference.
[2:41:35.600 --> 2:41:36.600]  That's what he kept saying.
[2:41:36.600 --> 2:41:37.600]  No, no, no.
[2:41:37.600 --> 2:41:38.600]  No, no.
[2:41:38.600 --> 2:41:39.600]  You're fake news.
[2:41:39.600 --> 2:41:40.600]  No, not you.
[2:41:40.600 --> 2:41:41.600]  Shut up.
[2:41:41.600 --> 2:41:42.600]  Be quiet.
[2:41:42.600 --> 2:41:43.600]  You're being rude.
[2:41:43.600 --> 2:41:44.600]  And he keeps pointing to somebody else and saying, but you're talking about us.
[2:41:44.600 --> 2:41:45.600]  You're just like, that's right.
[2:41:45.600 --> 2:41:48.840]  I'm talking about you and I'm not going to let you ask me a question because you're not
[2:41:48.840 --> 2:41:49.840]  legitimate.
[2:41:49.840 --> 2:41:52.520]  He's going to go over your head.
[2:41:52.520 --> 2:41:55.640]  And this is something that Ronald Reagan always said he would do, but he never did.
[2:41:55.640 --> 2:41:59.360]  He said, we're going to go over the heads of the opposition in Washington, over the
[2:41:59.360 --> 2:42:00.360]  heads of the press.
[2:42:00.360 --> 2:42:04.560]  And he did to a limited degree, of course, Donald Trump didn't have the tools of social
[2:42:04.560 --> 2:42:06.840]  media and the internet that Donald Trump has.
[2:42:06.840 --> 2:42:09.600]  Now Donald Trump can speak directly to the people.
[2:42:09.600 --> 2:42:12.160]  He doesn't even need these press conferences.
[2:42:12.160 --> 2:42:14.520]  He certainly doesn't need to call on CNN.
[2:42:14.520 --> 2:42:19.720]  Let's go to the clip where he talks about his employees and how he warned them about
[2:42:19.720 --> 2:42:22.200]  what can happen when they're on business trips.
[2:42:22.200 --> 2:42:23.920]  What can happen in hotel rooms?
[2:42:23.920 --> 2:42:25.080]  He wasn't born yesterday.
[2:42:25.080 --> 2:42:26.080]  He's not an idiot.
[2:42:26.080 --> 2:42:31.280]  He's talked about how, if you've got anything important to say, don't use a computer.
[2:42:31.280 --> 2:42:33.120]  Write it on paper and use a courier to send it.
[2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:34.320]  He said no computer is safe.
[2:42:34.320 --> 2:42:36.600]  He told that to reporters weeks ago.
[2:42:36.600 --> 2:42:40.320]  And this is what he tells his employees when they travel.
[2:42:40.320 --> 2:42:46.320]  When I leave our country, I'm a very high profile person, would you say?
[2:42:46.320 --> 2:42:48.400]  I am extremely careful.
[2:42:48.400 --> 2:42:50.600]  I'm surrounded by bodyguards.
[2:42:50.600 --> 2:42:52.800]  I'm surrounded by people.
[2:42:52.800 --> 2:42:58.640]  And I always tell them, anywhere, but I always tell them, if I'm leaving this country, be
[2:42:58.640 --> 2:43:04.560]  very careful because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you're going to probably
[2:43:04.560 --> 2:43:05.560]  have cameras.
[2:43:05.560 --> 2:43:10.720]  I'm not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category.
[2:43:10.720 --> 2:43:13.600]  And number one, I hope you're going to be good anyway.
[2:43:13.600 --> 2:43:18.720]  But in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places, cameras that are so small
[2:43:18.720 --> 2:43:23.600]  with modern technology, you can't see them and you won't know.
[2:43:23.600 --> 2:43:30.160]  You better be careful or you'll be watching yourself on nightly television.
[2:43:30.160 --> 2:43:34.240]  I tell this to people all the time.
[2:43:34.240 --> 2:43:39.480]  I was in Russia years ago with the Miss Universe Contest, which did very well.
[2:43:39.480 --> 2:43:43.520]  Moscow, the Moscow area, did very, very well.
[2:43:43.520 --> 2:43:50.000]  And I told many people, be careful because you don't want to see yourself in television.
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:51.520]  Camera's all over the place.
[2:43:51.520 --> 2:43:55.320]  And again, not just Russia, all over.
[2:43:55.320 --> 2:43:58.840]  This is somebody who has lived in the public eye for decades.
[2:43:58.840 --> 2:44:02.560]  Even before he had a television series, he was in the public eye all the time.
[2:44:02.560 --> 2:44:04.640]  He has dealt with paparazzi.
[2:44:04.640 --> 2:44:08.480]  He has dealt with people telling lies about him in the media.
[2:44:08.480 --> 2:44:12.200]  And so he certainly, as he points out, you don't want to see yourself on television.
[2:44:12.200 --> 2:44:15.680]  He is not, he wasn't born yesterday.
[2:44:15.680 --> 2:44:16.800]  He knows what this is about.
[2:44:16.800 --> 2:44:18.240]  He knows what computers are about.
[2:44:18.240 --> 2:44:23.760]  That's why he knows how to keep this, he's not going to do something that foolish.
[2:44:23.760 --> 2:44:29.800]  Even pointed out later in the press conference, he says, and by the way, I'm really paranoid
[2:44:29.800 --> 2:44:30.800]  about terms.
[2:44:30.800 --> 2:44:35.200]  Of course, I would never do anything remotely like what they're talking about doing.
[2:44:35.200 --> 2:44:36.400]  It's absolutely absurd.
[2:44:36.400 --> 2:44:41.480]  But it reminded me, remember going back to the debates, I think it was a second debate.
[2:44:41.480 --> 2:44:45.920]  And he had a sniffle or something, and a couple of times he would pause and he would go, and
[2:44:45.920 --> 2:44:49.200]  he would inhale and you could hear him inhaling through his nose.
[2:44:49.200 --> 2:44:55.360]  And Carrie Fisher, who just recently passed away, who had struggled with drugs all of
[2:44:55.360 --> 2:45:04.320]  her life, projected her addiction problems onto a man who is a total teetotaler.
[2:45:04.320 --> 2:45:11.680]  A man who everybody that knows him personally says that he has, because of the experiences
[2:45:11.680 --> 2:45:17.600]  in his family, had a brother who was an alcoholic, he has stayed away from that completely.
[2:45:17.600 --> 2:45:20.400]  And he has made it pretty clear, I think you can see it in his children.
[2:45:20.400 --> 2:45:24.640]  I mean, his children look like they're very successful, they're very straight.
[2:45:24.640 --> 2:45:30.440]  They don't have not fallen to the kinds of deprivations that have become very common
[2:45:30.440 --> 2:45:31.880]  with Hollywood.
[2:45:31.880 --> 2:45:35.920]  But these people in Hollywood, they project their drug addictions.
[2:45:35.920 --> 2:45:41.440]  They project their sexual perversions onto other people.
[2:45:41.440 --> 2:45:43.440]  And there's a confirmation bias there.
[2:45:43.440 --> 2:45:48.360]  These people who don't like Donald Trump can easily believe, oh yeah, he was snorting cocaine
[2:45:48.360 --> 2:45:50.840]  or something before the debates, no.
[2:45:50.840 --> 2:45:55.080]  That is absolutely out of context with his character, just as it's absolutely out of
[2:45:55.080 --> 2:45:57.280]  context with his character that he would do something like this.
[2:45:57.280 --> 2:46:00.800]  But they believe it because it's the sort of world that they live in.
[2:46:00.800 --> 2:46:04.800]  So they project that onto him, the people who are there hear it, and it's confirmed
[2:46:04.800 --> 2:46:08.880]  because of their own personal lives, their own personal bias.
[2:46:08.880 --> 2:46:11.720]  Let's go to the next clip here where he talked about Obamacare.
[2:46:11.720 --> 2:46:17.200]  But before we do, I really quickly want to talk about what, before this was taken over,
[2:46:17.200 --> 2:46:19.960]  because again, going back to Obamacare, that's something he wanted to talk about.
[2:46:19.960 --> 2:46:24.040]  The other thing he wanted to talk about that we haven't talked about here that's very important
[2:46:24.040 --> 2:46:28.720]  is how he's going to deal with this next attack on him, and that is the issue of conflict
[2:46:28.720 --> 2:46:29.720]  of interest.
[2:46:29.720 --> 2:46:33.400]  And of course, Rand Paul said, hey, we knew he had a successful business before people
[2:46:33.400 --> 2:46:34.400]  voted for him.
[2:46:34.400 --> 2:46:36.640]  They knew that, they voted for him anyway.
[2:46:36.640 --> 2:46:40.800]  And that's what Donald Trump said in this press conference.
[2:46:40.800 --> 2:46:45.120]  There's also the issue of how does he divest himself from this?
[2:46:45.120 --> 2:46:46.720]  Should he turn himself into a pauper?
[2:46:46.720 --> 2:46:50.560]  Should he burn down his entire life's work so that he can serve in public life?
[2:46:50.560 --> 2:46:52.220]  I don't think we want that.
[2:46:52.220 --> 2:46:57.600]  We don't want to limit ourselves to people who are career politicians and who aspire
[2:46:57.600 --> 2:47:01.160]  to becoming lobbyists after they finish with their elected office.
[2:47:01.160 --> 2:47:04.720]  That's what we've seen so far from the leaders of the Republican and Democrat Party.
[2:47:04.720 --> 2:47:09.440]  We don't want to limit ourselves to people who are lawyers or people even worse who have
[2:47:09.440 --> 2:47:12.040]  no experience other than them being community organizers.
[2:47:12.040 --> 2:47:15.300]  Like Barack Obama, he never accomplished anything in his life.
[2:47:15.300 --> 2:47:21.160]  So we don't want to make it impossible for people who have earned money.
[2:47:21.160 --> 2:47:26.000]  We don't want to require them to burn down their life's work in order to serve in government.
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:27.000]  That's the whole point here.
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:29.280]  I think he came up with an acceptable compromise.
[2:47:29.280 --> 2:47:35.760]  The woman who explained this said that because there's been questions about what emoluments
[2:47:35.760 --> 2:47:41.240]  are, and of course, if you look at it in the Constitution, essentially what they're saying
[2:47:41.240 --> 2:47:45.640]  is we're not going to let you take bribes and payments from princes and foreign governments
[2:47:45.640 --> 2:47:47.920]  like Hillary Clinton did, okay?
[2:47:47.920 --> 2:47:50.520]  That was what the whole Clinton Foundation was about.
[2:47:50.520 --> 2:47:55.040]  That's what it was founded on, was her taking emoluments as the Constitution.
[2:47:55.040 --> 2:48:00.440]  But it from princes, literally, from a Saudi prince who had bragged that at one point we've
[2:48:00.440 --> 2:48:03.960]  given her 25% of the money that she's gotten.
[2:48:03.960 --> 2:48:09.840]  So we know that's what was happening with the Clintons, and so to avoid that, we've
[2:48:09.840 --> 2:48:13.600]  had Donald Trump's sons shut down charities where they had raised a great deal of money
[2:48:13.600 --> 2:48:14.600]  for people.
[2:48:14.600 --> 2:48:18.880]  So I'm just not going to be involved with this because of the criminality, because of
[2:48:18.880 --> 2:48:21.960]  the implications, because of what the Clintons did.
[2:48:21.960 --> 2:48:27.360]  They have smeared the idea that somebody in public office would be involved in a charity.
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:29.560]  They've painted that idea, unfortunately.
[2:48:29.560 --> 2:48:31.960]  That's the legacy of Hillary and Bill Clinton.
[2:48:31.960 --> 2:48:36.000]  So he had to back off and distance himself from a charity.
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:39.320]  And then when you look at these other issues, they say, well, you've got hotels around the
[2:48:39.320 --> 2:48:40.320]  world.
[2:48:40.320 --> 2:48:44.240]  So if a foreign government were to come in and stay at your hotel and pay for the hotel
[2:48:44.240 --> 2:48:49.400]  room and pay for the service that you provide, then you would be violating the Constitution.
[2:48:49.400 --> 2:48:50.800]  I don't think that's the case.
[2:48:50.800 --> 2:48:52.280]  They said they didn't think that was the case.
[2:48:52.280 --> 2:48:56.200]  But to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest, they're going to go the extra
[2:48:56.200 --> 2:49:02.360]  mile and they're going to say, we're going to take any money that was made that was paid
[2:49:02.360 --> 2:49:04.840]  by a foreign government.
[2:49:04.840 --> 2:49:09.400]  We're going to donate that to the United States government treasury.
[2:49:09.400 --> 2:49:11.400]  Just donate it.
[2:49:11.400 --> 2:49:15.720]  That's the difference between Donald Trump and the corrupt Clintons.
[2:49:15.720 --> 2:49:20.600]  And I think that's something that we cannot ignore from this press conference today.
[2:49:20.600 --> 2:49:24.320]  Because an emolument is a salary, a fee, or a profit.
[2:49:24.320 --> 2:49:27.700]  Now, you could say, oh, well, he's making a profit from these people staying at his
[2:49:27.700 --> 2:49:28.700]  hotel room.
[2:49:28.700 --> 2:49:31.480]  He says, no, it will be from employment or office.
[2:49:31.480 --> 2:49:35.000]  In other words, you cannot work for these people.
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:40.440]  You cannot have an official title or position with these people and get paid by them and
[2:49:40.440 --> 2:49:43.520]  still be a part of the American government, obviously.
[2:49:43.520 --> 2:49:47.440]  And of course, you obviously cannot peddle influence like the Clintons were doing because
[2:49:47.440 --> 2:49:50.080]  that's just simply corruption and crime.
[2:49:50.080 --> 2:49:51.440]  So there's nothing new about that.
[2:49:51.440 --> 2:49:55.320]  And really, what he's talking about doesn't even fall in that.
[2:49:55.320 --> 2:49:59.800]  But he knows that Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and these other people who have for
[2:49:59.800 --> 2:50:05.520]  years covered their trails with insider trading on the stock market, created the stock act
[2:50:05.520 --> 2:50:08.040]  when they got caught red-handed, like Nancy Pelosi did.
[2:50:08.040 --> 2:50:11.880]  And then when everybody stopped looking at it and it got out of the news cycle, they gutted
[2:50:11.880 --> 2:50:12.880]  it.
[2:50:12.880 --> 2:50:15.800]  And so is Elizabeth Warren involved in that.
[2:50:15.800 --> 2:50:22.520]  So in order to avoid their unjustified attacks, he's going to go the extra mile and donate
[2:50:22.520 --> 2:50:26.560]  any money from his businesses where he is not being employed by these people.
[2:50:26.560 --> 2:50:28.920]  He is not holding an office by these other people.
[2:50:28.920 --> 2:50:30.080]  He is not selling influence.
[2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:32.200]  He's simply got a business that's providing this.
[2:50:32.200 --> 2:50:35.520]  The other thing they said, and I'll move on to this next clip, that he said, we're going
[2:50:35.520 --> 2:50:40.360]  to run this so that he's only going to know if there's a profit or loss.
[2:50:40.360 --> 2:50:43.320]  He's not going to know any details about the way the business is being operated.
[2:50:43.320 --> 2:50:45.400]  And I don't think that's an unreasonable thing to do.
[2:50:45.400 --> 2:50:48.720]  And when we come back, we're going to have Alex Jones joining us, and we're going to
[2:50:48.720 --> 2:50:51.920]  play some additional clips from this press conference today.
[2:50:51.920 --> 2:50:53.120]  He also talked about Obamacare.
[2:50:53.120 --> 2:50:56.440]  The Republicans say, well, I just don't know it's so complicated, I don't think we can
[2:50:56.440 --> 2:50:57.440]  get rid of it.
[2:50:57.440 --> 2:50:59.200]  Donald Trump said, yes, we can.
[2:50:59.200 --> 2:51:05.240]  If you're like me, you appreciate the feeling of a clean, smooth shave from a quality blade.
[2:51:05.240 --> 2:51:09.000]  The sort of shave that cuts clean without the burn.
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:14.040]  So why are you messing around with generic razors that cost 32 bucks for an 8-pack?
[2:51:14.040 --> 2:51:19.080]  When you can shave with Harry's high-quality German engineered blades for half the price.
[2:51:19.080 --> 2:51:22.920]  And because Harry's is so confident in the quality of their blades, they'll send you

[2:51:43.080 --> 2:51:44.280]  ever enjoy?
[2:51:44.280 --> 2:51:47.440]  By owning the factory that manufactures the blades.

[2:54:18.480 --> 2:54:22.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live, I'm co-hosting with David Knight in a segment in the next
[2:54:22.240 --> 2:54:28.200]  in Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, the guy that really spurred Trump
[2:54:28.200 --> 2:54:33.800]  to run, one of his top confidants, is gonna be hosting the fourth hour.
[2:54:33.800 --> 2:54:39.280]  When the Media Matters documents came out, of course they were talking about taking out
[2:54:39.280 --> 2:54:47.520]  the MVP, Roger Stone, getting him banned off CNN, MSNBC, and other channels, showing incredible
[2:54:47.520 --> 2:54:53.160]  Democratic Party control of those different apparatuses.
[2:54:53.160 --> 2:54:57.920]  But what do I keep hammering here, is the theme hit me between the eyes today.
[2:54:57.920 --> 2:55:05.120]  This is the further death of the MSM, the biggest strike ever, and the fact that the
[2:55:05.120 --> 2:55:10.280]  MSM is so arrogant that they think they can just put out fake news, knowing it's fake,
[2:55:10.280 --> 2:55:14.080]  and that no one's going to counter them, illustrates everything.
[2:55:14.080 --> 2:55:20.320]  I know I've hammered this three times in an hour with David, and with you, the audience,
[2:55:20.320 --> 2:55:22.760]  but just think about it.
[2:55:22.760 --> 2:55:29.880]  Everybody knows the arrogant mentally ill scumbag who's a known fraud, but continues
[2:55:29.880 --> 2:55:33.280]  to try to con everybody into following along with them.
[2:55:33.280 --> 2:55:36.200]  Once a con artist gets caught, they keep trying to con.
[2:55:36.200 --> 2:55:45.120]  In fact, the cons just get bigger, and bigger, and bigger, MSM calls info wars con men.
[2:55:45.120 --> 2:55:48.000]  They call Trump con men, no.
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:49.480]  They're the con men.
[2:55:49.480 --> 2:55:51.720]  We're based on a track record of accuracy.
[2:55:51.720 --> 2:55:54.000]  We're based on a track record of freedom.
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:55:56.000]  We're based on a track record of courage.
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:55:59.280]  They're based on a track record of duplicitous fraud.
[2:55:59.280 --> 2:56:02.760]  Think about the big Silicon Valley executive that came out and said, middle America's
[2:56:02.760 --> 2:56:06.160]  gross and ugly and white people are gross and bad.
[2:56:06.160 --> 2:56:07.160]  It's a white guy.
[2:56:07.160 --> 2:56:09.480]  These are mentally ill people.
[2:56:09.480 --> 2:56:15.880]  They're completely disconnected, and they've got such a weird feeling of elitism that they
[2:56:15.880 --> 2:56:18.240]  are completely insane.
[2:56:18.240 --> 2:56:24.160]  So the big news is, Trump in this three-hour press conference, a savage MSM, here's CNN
[2:56:24.160 --> 2:56:29.320]  that attacks Roger Stone, yours truly, and many others constantly, and never gives us
[2:56:29.320 --> 2:56:30.720]  a chance to respond.
[2:56:30.720 --> 2:56:33.040]  It's always one way.
[2:56:33.040 --> 2:56:37.320]  But notice he's complaining after they put out a story saying Trump is in a room with
[2:56:37.320 --> 2:56:41.760]  women urinating on him, basically, total made up lie, been on the internet for over
[2:56:41.760 --> 2:56:42.760]  a year.
[2:56:42.760 --> 2:56:43.760]  Totally fake.
[2:56:43.760 --> 2:56:45.320]  They put it out like it's real.
[2:56:45.320 --> 2:56:47.240]  John McCain basically takes credit for it.
[2:56:47.240 --> 2:56:49.640]  That's how arrogant he is.
[2:56:49.640 --> 2:56:53.920]  And then he doesn't give them a chance to respond while he is talking.
[2:56:53.920 --> 2:56:57.960]  They're interrupting him saying, you've got to go to us.
[2:56:57.960 --> 2:56:58.960]  You just talked about us.
[2:56:58.960 --> 2:56:59.960]  No, no, no, no.
[2:56:59.960 --> 2:57:05.520]  That was the old-fashioned journalism before you ruined it, CNN, where, yes, if you did
[2:57:05.520 --> 2:57:09.560]  talk about somebody, they'd get a chance to respond, but you're not real media.
[2:57:09.560 --> 2:57:11.840]  You don't deserve the same respects, come back.
[2:57:11.840 --> 2:57:13.880]  You want to shut Trump off, Twitter.
[2:57:13.880 --> 2:57:15.760]  You want to shut info wars up.
[2:57:15.760 --> 2:57:16.760]  You want to shut Drudge Up.
[2:57:16.760 --> 2:57:17.760]  Well, guess what?
[2:57:17.760 --> 2:57:21.600]  We're not going to physically shut you up authoritarian-wise.
[2:57:21.600 --> 2:57:24.200]  Everybody's just tuning out of you.
[2:57:24.200 --> 2:57:26.200]  You were already imploded.
[2:57:26.200 --> 2:57:27.400]  You were already a joke.
[2:57:27.400 --> 2:57:28.760]  You were already a fraud.
[2:57:28.760 --> 2:57:30.200]  And now you're worse than that.
[2:57:30.200 --> 2:57:33.640]  You are synonymous with dirtbags.
[2:57:33.640 --> 2:57:35.520]  You're synonymous with betrayal.
[2:57:35.520 --> 2:57:37.520]  You're synonymous with backstabbing.
[2:57:37.520 --> 2:57:42.240]  You're synonymous with this being the enemies that thought they had this country.
[2:57:42.240 --> 2:57:46.960]  And now the acceleration of their implosion is going to get even crazier.
[2:57:46.960 --> 2:57:48.960]  Here's the problem.
[2:57:48.960 --> 2:57:53.240]  Out of sheer spite in the next nine days, as they see their entire empire burn, they are
[2:57:53.240 --> 2:57:54.240]  going to pull out the stops.
[2:57:54.240 --> 2:58:00.320]  You think PP gave his big hoax, get ready, the next nine days are going to be more dirt
[2:58:00.320 --> 2:58:02.320]  than you've seen the last year.
[2:58:02.320 --> 2:58:03.320]  Watch it happen.
[2:58:03.320 --> 2:58:08.480]  By tonight, they're going to try to change subjects with a false flag or a new scandal
[2:58:08.480 --> 2:58:09.840]  or an assassination.
[2:58:09.840 --> 2:58:15.320]  You watch something big by tonight because every bit of discrediting garbage they've
[2:58:15.320 --> 2:58:18.160]  had previous is nothing to this now.
[2:58:18.160 --> 2:58:24.880]  This is like 1,000 suns to the previous garbage where they got caught lying about the polls
[2:58:24.880 --> 2:58:29.400]  and lying, giving Hillary the questions and lying about WMDs.
[2:58:29.400 --> 2:58:34.320]  Everything is coming home to roost on them, everything, and now is the key.
[2:58:34.320 --> 2:58:39.720]  The next nine days, we'll be back, stay with us with David Knight, Roger Schoen and others.
[2:58:39.720 --> 2:58:42.560]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:58:42.560 --> 2:58:49.560]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:43:01.280 --> 2:59:46.480] 's itforwarslives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[2:59:46.480 --> 2:59:59.840]  Take action now before we sell out.
[2:59:59.840 --> 3:00:19.720]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting in the World Wide, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:19.720 --> 3:00:25.640]  Alright, David Knight is in the info wars news, room studios in Austin, Texas, Roger
[3:00:25.640 --> 3:00:30.520]  Stone, he is joining us via his Skype connection, I'm not sure if he's in New York or Florida,
[3:00:30.520 --> 3:00:35.120]  we'll find out in a moment, and I'm joining you via telephone, these are such incredibly
[3:00:35.120 --> 3:00:41.960]  historic times, I keep hammering that, because we are seeing the final implosion of MSM,
[3:00:41.960 --> 3:00:46.880]  they have no credibility, they are so delusional, seeing they believe they have no natural predators
[3:00:46.880 --> 3:00:52.000]  in the media landscape like Dodo birds, they believe they can put out lies and not have
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:56.800]  somebody counter them, and the way everything they do now turns to crap, we've all heard
[3:00:56.800 --> 3:01:03.040]  of a Midas touch, at least people have a horse manure touch, so David Knight, great job co-hosting
[3:01:03.040 --> 3:01:09.520]  and traffic copying of this amazing transmission, we've got the 4th hour with Roger Stone joining
[3:01:09.520 --> 3:01:13.480]  us, again thank you for a great job in 60 seconds, any other key points?
[3:01:13.480 --> 3:01:17.440]  Well thank you Alex, one of the things that I think has emerged, we didn't get to the
[3:01:17.440 --> 3:01:23.280]  Obamacare points, but Donald Trump says he's going to very quickly repeal and simultaneously
[3:01:23.280 --> 3:01:28.440]  or soon after replace the insurance issues of people who are left up in the air with
[3:01:28.440 --> 3:01:32.640]  Obamacare, but the Republicans are trying to delay this as much as possible, but he's
[3:01:32.640 --> 3:01:37.520]  not going to do that, he's not going to sit around and cut bait, he's going to start
[3:01:37.520 --> 3:01:38.760]  fishing from day one.
[3:01:38.760 --> 3:01:42.280]  Well that's right, he understands not just that it's the right thing to do, but if he
[3:01:42.280 --> 3:01:47.120]  delivers or even tries to deliver, he will return confidence to the government, confidence
[3:01:47.120 --> 3:01:50.680]  to the executive branch and will restore the republic, a lot of media goes, oh it's an
[3:01:50.680 --> 3:01:55.720]  oxymoron, Alex says the government's corrupt but he likes Trump, yeah I'm not anti-government,
[3:01:55.720 --> 3:02:01.520]  they believe their own propaganda, I'm anti-corrupt big giant unconstitutional government, I
[3:02:01.520 --> 3:02:05.760]  love our republic and as Benjamin Franklin said, it's a republic and I'd like to try
[3:02:05.760 --> 3:02:06.760]  to keep it.
[3:02:06.760 --> 3:02:07.760]  Thank you so much David Knight.
[3:02:07.760 --> 3:02:08.760]  Thank you Alex.
[3:02:08.760 --> 3:02:13.240]  Okay, one of the amazing crew back in Austin, Texas, we've got six clips coming up in this
[3:02:13.240 --> 3:02:16.960]  hour, I'm only going to host a few more minutes into the next segment and introduce
[3:02:16.960 --> 3:02:17.960]  Roger Stone.
[3:02:17.960 --> 3:02:22.720]  We haven't gotten to the Obamacare clip yet but I think when we start the next segment,
[3:02:22.720 --> 3:02:27.000]  the most important clip to get to is when he calls out fake news singing in and says
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:31.760]  no, no you never let us respond, you're not going to get to respond, you're not real news,
[3:02:31.760 --> 3:02:32.760]  you're fake.
[3:02:32.760 --> 3:02:36.440]  Is this not, we're going to break it one minute Roger but I believe you're there, I can't
[3:02:36.440 --> 3:02:40.320]  see it because I'm on the road via phone, I believe this is their waterloo, I mean they're
[3:02:40.320 --> 3:02:46.160]  still going to have some death rows but I think this is the demarcation line Roger.
[3:02:46.160 --> 3:02:52.080]  Thanks Alex, I'm delighted to be back with you, I'm in an undisclosed location in sunny
[3:02:52.080 --> 3:02:53.080]  south Florida.
[3:02:53.080 --> 3:02:58.640]  And this has been one of the most historic, I mean do you think this is the moment when
[3:02:58.640 --> 3:03:01.320]  MSM finally completely implodes?
[3:03:01.320 --> 3:03:07.640]  Well through their own hand here because what they have done is so ridiculously ham-handed
[3:03:07.640 --> 3:03:16.440]  and obvious and so obviously fake news that they're just disillusioning more and more
[3:03:16.440 --> 3:03:22.280]  of the people who see them trying to manipulate events.
[3:03:22.280 --> 3:03:29.480]  The entire Russian hacking meme that has been the drumbeat first of the Clinton campaign
[3:03:29.480 --> 3:03:37.480]  and then of the 17 individual intelligence agencies all headed by political appointees
[3:03:37.480 --> 3:03:46.840]  who are partisans, the investigation and rummaging through this issue by John McCain and now
[3:03:46.840 --> 3:03:55.800]  news that a US senator took what is obviously a fabricated document.
[3:03:55.800 --> 3:04:02.440]  And by the way, if the British intelligence agent who wrote this allegedly wants our respect
[3:04:02.440 --> 3:04:11.120]  perhaps he should learn how to spell, this document has these wild accusations regarding
[3:04:11.120 --> 3:04:17.320]  Donald Trump, it provides your dates, and I'm going to hand the baton to Roger Stone,
[3:04:17.320 --> 3:04:23.000]  he's got a list of the epic press conference today which is really a routing of MSM, it's
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:28.440]  all posted at infowars.com and stoneculture.com as well, he has basically finished his book,
[3:04:28.440 --> 3:04:33.440]  that's exciting news as well, this is a big fourth hour today, this is history, I keep
[3:04:33.440 --> 3:04:37.400]  saying history, history, history, because make no mistake, history is passing in front of
[3:04:37.400 --> 3:04:41.160]  us and we're all part of it and that's why I want to salute the crew and everybody else,
[3:04:41.160 --> 3:04:45.440]  this is an amazing town to be alive and again on the other side of this break I will hand
[3:04:45.440 --> 3:04:59.640]  the baton to Roger Stone, I'm Alex Jones in FullWars.com, stay with us.
[3:04:59.640 --> 3:05:06.000]  President-elect Donald Trump calls CNN fake news during a live press conference.
[3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:35.760]  Trump went on to say that the fake stream news
[3:05:35.760 --> 3:05:52.600]  media has destroyed lives and all he wants is honest reporters, and you can watch more
[3:05:52.600 --> 3:05:58.720]  highlights from Donald Trump's press conference right now at infowars.com.
[3:05:58.720 --> 3:06:08.000]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able
[3:06:08.000 --> 3:06:14.080]  to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[3:06:14.080 --> 3:06:18.800]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your
[3:06:18.800 --> 3:06:24.000]  body, it helps balance the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify.
[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:26.480]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[3:06:26.480 --> 3:06:30.480]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used
[3:06:30.480 --> 3:06:36.360]  all over the body, as a matter of fact there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent
[3:06:36.360 --> 3:06:42.840]  upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[3:06:42.840 --> 3:06:48.400]  I'm taking it now every day, this is soaking, bio-true, selenium is the product, the best
[3:06:48.400 --> 3:06:51.520]  selenium that we could bring you, we believe it's the best out there at a very, very low
[3:06:51.520 --> 3:06:52.520]  price.
[3:06:52.520 --> 3:06:58.760]  You can find it at www.infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free, triple 825-33139.

[3:07:27.560 --> 3:07:31.920]  Listeners have been requesting this for years, because it's so easy to forget to reorder

[3:07:46.720 --> 3:07:48.120]  this is a sure win.

[3:08:12.200 --> 3:08:20.200]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[3:08:20.200 --> 3:08:35.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[3:08:35.400 --> 3:08:40.240]  I'm about to hand the baton to the rest of the hour to my good friend Roger Stone, who
[3:08:40.240 --> 3:08:44.840]  is a very humble man, but let me tell you, behind the scenes, he has been a powerhouse
[3:08:44.840 --> 3:08:47.440]  for the restoration of this Republic.
[3:08:47.440 --> 3:08:53.480]  Now, I keep using the term history or historical or epic, and I don't use that term because
[3:08:53.480 --> 3:08:55.480]  I've run out of words.
[3:08:55.480 --> 3:08:56.480]  That's the time we're in.
[3:08:56.480 --> 3:08:59.400]  History is happening to our left, to our right.
[3:08:59.400 --> 3:09:05.560]  In front of us, behind us, below us, above us, 360 everywhere.
[3:09:05.560 --> 3:09:12.360]  This is a major sea change atmosphere, and basically, it's almost all good.
[3:09:12.360 --> 3:09:13.520]  We've had so much bad.
[3:09:13.520 --> 3:09:18.240]  We've had so much tyranny, so much corruption, so much evil, so much pedophilia, just all
[3:09:18.240 --> 3:09:19.720]  the lies.
[3:09:19.720 --> 3:09:26.520]  The evil wars, the support of radical Islam, has been intensifying and intensifying, and
[3:09:26.520 --> 3:09:32.280]  the elites recruited more and more people like themselves into power until we hit such
[3:09:32.280 --> 3:09:36.640]  rock bottom that now I can clearly say, and I'm sure of it, and other historians are pointing
[3:09:36.640 --> 3:09:41.080]  it out, that we are beginning the ascent back up.
[3:09:41.080 --> 3:09:43.240]  That doesn't mean there's going to be serious battles.
[3:09:43.240 --> 3:09:45.160]  It doesn't mean things are going to be perfect.
[3:09:45.160 --> 3:09:53.160]  It doesn't mean, like communists were offering some utopia, but huge things are happening.
[3:09:53.160 --> 3:09:59.360]  We are seeing the final bellwether of the death of MSM with BuzzFeed and CNN and McCain
[3:09:59.360 --> 3:10:04.840]  and the U.S. Senate running with this fake report last week, complaining about criticism
[3:10:04.840 --> 3:10:10.800]  on Russian TV of Hillary, calling that a hack, claiming they have the IP address of the Russians,
[3:10:10.800 --> 3:10:11.800]  where they did it.
[3:10:11.800 --> 3:10:13.880]  I mean, that's a total frame up.
[3:10:13.880 --> 3:10:19.160]  All of this amateur garbage, this latest report that's been out for over a year that has misspellings
[3:10:19.160 --> 3:10:25.840]  in it and looks like a 12-year-old wrote it on purpose as a setup, it shows the delusion
[3:10:25.840 --> 3:10:29.240]  and really shows how pathetic the current crop of people are.
[3:10:29.240 --> 3:10:30.240]  But here's the key psychology.
[3:10:30.240 --> 3:10:34.160]  I'm going to play a clip and go to stone.
[3:10:34.160 --> 3:10:38.360]  The elites don't believe that they can be beaten.
[3:10:38.360 --> 3:10:42.400]  That's why they only intensify their actions that got them to this place.
[3:10:42.400 --> 3:10:46.720]  The true definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, believing
[3:10:46.720 --> 3:10:49.160]  you're going to get different results.
[3:10:49.160 --> 3:10:53.280]  That's why they've gone into pure hysteria with nine days out.
[3:10:53.280 --> 3:10:58.200]  There is no telling what they're going to pull now, because everything exponentially
[3:10:58.200 --> 3:10:59.800]  gets crazier.
[3:10:59.800 --> 3:11:05.080]  Whereas we're winning the info war, whereas they're completely discrediting themselves,
[3:11:05.080 --> 3:11:10.200]  whereas Donald Trump's over-the-top press conference this morning that should go down
[3:11:10.200 --> 3:11:19.360]  in history as the moment that a real man stood up against the forces of bullying and disinformation.
[3:11:19.360 --> 3:11:23.960]  The media for decades, mainstream media, operated with no opposition, as Roger Stone's pointed
[3:11:23.960 --> 3:11:26.160]  out hundreds of times on this show.
[3:11:26.160 --> 3:11:30.360]  But now they're up against opposition that isn't just as big.
[3:11:30.360 --> 3:11:32.000]  We're bigger together.
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:34.360]  We have a track record of history.
[3:11:34.360 --> 3:11:35.360]  We're aggressive.
[3:11:35.360 --> 3:11:36.520]  We have energy.
[3:11:36.520 --> 3:11:43.680]  We have a sexy ideology of freedom and property and free association and true libertarian
[3:11:43.680 --> 3:11:44.680]  ideas.
[3:11:44.680 --> 3:11:50.880]  And the elite now are in full panic, but they've been operating like they could just get up
[3:11:50.880 --> 3:11:54.640]  and challenge people and lie about people together forever.
[3:11:54.640 --> 3:11:58.800]  But now they're in an atmosphere where they're actually outgunned.
[3:11:58.800 --> 3:12:02.960]  Before they had air superiority to drop lies on us all day.
[3:12:02.960 --> 3:12:03.960]  That's over.
[3:12:03.960 --> 3:12:08.240]  Now we are beginning to get the air superiority, and we're keeping each other honest.
[3:12:08.240 --> 3:12:12.040]  We're a wide spectrum of people of every race, color, and creed who want freedom.
[3:12:12.040 --> 3:12:13.560]  And it's unstoppable.
[3:12:13.560 --> 3:12:18.920]  Their attempt to censor the Internet, their cyber attacks on Brudge and on Roger Stone
[3:12:18.920 --> 3:12:25.200]  and on myself and on Trump only intensify the awakening of good people inside our own
[3:12:25.200 --> 3:12:29.560]  government, inside our intelligence agencies, and inside major corporations.
[3:12:29.560 --> 3:12:35.040]  The lies they've heaped on us only serve as badges of honor.
[3:12:35.040 --> 3:12:39.280]  So here's the final analysis that I'm handing the baton over to Roger Stone.
[3:12:39.280 --> 3:12:40.640]  The next nine days is critical.
[3:12:40.640 --> 3:12:41.640]  We all know that.
[3:12:41.640 --> 3:12:45.520]  It'll still be a hard fight after that, but we have the moral high ground.
[3:12:45.520 --> 3:12:50.840]  And I see this as Napoleon's Waterloo, Hitler's Stalingrad.
[3:12:50.840 --> 3:12:58.200]  What we saw with this weakened, demoralized MSM coming out with Pigate is the final nail
[3:12:58.200 --> 3:12:59.200]  in the coffin.
[3:12:59.200 --> 3:13:01.200]  They'll still be fragments of the enemy.
[3:13:01.200 --> 3:13:02.600]  They're still going to be a serious foe.
[3:13:02.600 --> 3:13:08.040]  But I tell you, this is so devastating to see their credibility go from zero to now negative
[3:13:08.040 --> 3:13:11.800]  after they lost the election, after they got caught in all these lies, after they got
[3:13:11.800 --> 3:13:16.320]  caught lying in the polls, after they got caught fixing things and giving Hillary the
[3:13:16.320 --> 3:13:20.600]  questions beforehand, after they got caught with Jerry Epstein and the pedophile airplane
[3:13:20.600 --> 3:13:24.120]  trying to put all this on Trump, the fake lawsuits against Trump.
[3:13:24.120 --> 3:13:26.360]  All of it is now blowing up in their face.
[3:13:26.360 --> 3:13:27.880]  It's an incredible moment.
[3:13:27.880 --> 3:13:33.040]  And to see Trump as the president, say, you're fake news CNN, I'm not going to go to you.
[3:13:33.040 --> 3:13:36.880]  And to have them say, but you talked about us, we deserve equal time.
[3:13:36.880 --> 3:13:41.520]  After decades of them not giving equal time to people like Roger Stone, the clips coming
[3:13:41.520 --> 3:13:42.520]  up in a moment.
[3:13:42.520 --> 3:13:45.640]  I'm going to let him introduce the CNN clip where he puts them in their place.
[3:13:45.640 --> 3:13:47.960]  But first, Roger, do you concur with this analysis?
[3:13:47.960 --> 3:13:51.520]  And that's how it didn't mean what they said it to.
[3:13:51.520 --> 3:13:55.040]  Well, my friend, I'm going to end the baton to you.
[3:13:55.040 --> 3:13:56.560]  Thank you so much for all your work.
[3:13:56.560 --> 3:13:59.280]  It's got to be satisfying to see this happen, but we're not out of the woods yet.
[3:13:59.280 --> 3:14:00.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone.
[3:14:00.680 --> 3:14:05.000]  Alex, thank you so much for letting me join you.
[3:14:05.000 --> 3:14:08.680]  Epic, there's really no other word for it.
[3:14:08.680 --> 3:14:14.760]  What has transpired here is the tipping point has been reached.
[3:14:14.760 --> 3:14:21.240]  The monopoly on political information that was held by the old order through the three
[3:14:21.240 --> 3:14:29.280]  cable, the two cable networks and the three broadcast networks has finally been broken
[3:14:29.280 --> 3:14:35.840]  with more and more and younger and younger votes, voters taking advantage of the technological
[3:14:35.840 --> 3:14:41.880]  revolution of getting their information on their handheld device.
[3:14:41.880 --> 3:14:49.360]  They have created an audience, a massive audience, for real media, for people doing real reporting
[3:14:49.360 --> 3:14:54.280]  and real investigative journalism.
[3:14:54.280 --> 3:15:02.840]  Those entities don't have big corporate multi-billion-dollar corporation sponsors like the old media, but
[3:15:02.840 --> 3:15:06.880]  the shift has taken place.
[3:15:06.880 --> 3:15:11.440]  Voters are getting their information now from a broader cross-section of sources and when
[3:15:11.440 --> 3:15:16.080]  they read Breitbart or when they see info wars or when they read the Daily Caller or
[3:15:16.080 --> 3:15:22.480]  when they follow Matt Drudge, their eyes are open to a world they didn't know existed.
[3:15:22.480 --> 3:15:31.480]  Now the mainstream media has gone into spasms because they see themselves losing control
[3:15:31.480 --> 3:15:37.680]  and now they remove any bounds of what we used to call journalism.
[3:15:37.680 --> 3:15:46.960]  Ben Smith at BuzzFeed, really to his credit they said in their breaking story that none
[3:15:46.960 --> 3:15:53.600]  of this information regarding Trump and illicit sex and the Russians and blackmail was verified
[3:15:53.600 --> 3:16:02.200]  or confirmed or if any substation or proof had ever been produced, which it has not.
[3:16:02.200 --> 3:16:09.080]  But that did not stop CNN from grabbing it and breaking it into the mainstream while
[3:16:09.080 --> 3:16:12.560]  delegations against Donald Trump, none of which are true.
[3:16:12.560 --> 3:16:18.680]  If for no other reason, believe me, I've known Donald Trump for 40 years, he's much too smart
[3:16:18.680 --> 3:16:26.000]  to ever put himself into that kind of a compromising situation.
[3:16:26.000 --> 3:16:33.360]  He knows when he goes into somebody else's building that he's light or taped, so he would
[3:16:33.360 --> 3:16:41.040]  never do that and this is the wild last gas BuzzFeed, I mean in all honesty, Ben Smith
[3:16:41.040 --> 3:16:46.840]  is trying to drive people to cute videos of kittens, but this is not journalism, this
[3:16:46.840 --> 3:16:49.160]  is fake news.
[3:16:49.160 --> 3:16:59.840]  And then CNN, the worst of the fake news offenders, they take this narrative and they try to make
[3:16:59.840 --> 3:17:03.440]  it respectable.
[3:17:03.440 --> 3:17:09.000]  What I find most alarming here, frankly, is the role of John McCain.
[3:17:09.000 --> 3:17:16.880]  The idea that a U.S. senator would go out and get a report and turn it over to the federal
[3:17:16.880 --> 3:17:26.680]  government that is clearly a fabrication makes McCain's motives, I think, painfully obvious.
[3:17:26.680 --> 3:17:35.600]  The other point here, if I may, was this circus that John McCain conducted before the Armed
[3:17:35.600 --> 3:17:37.600]  Services Committee.
[3:17:37.600 --> 3:17:44.080]  This was, I think, a true lesson in how the agency works.
[3:17:44.080 --> 3:17:54.160]  The CIA, the FBI, the National Security Agency prepared a special report for the president
[3:17:54.160 --> 3:18:01.880]  that made the case that Vladimir Putin personally directed an effort to hack the American election
[3:18:01.880 --> 3:18:05.440]  to the benefit of Donald J. Trump.
[3:18:05.440 --> 3:18:11.560]  And it says, let me read from the New York Post, a great newspaper, no evidence was presented
[3:18:11.560 --> 3:18:19.520]  to back up the conclusions which officials say that information had to remain secret.
[3:18:19.520 --> 3:18:24.840]  The document's conclusions are identical to the highly classified assessment, including
[3:18:24.840 --> 3:18:30.200]  the full supporting information, including special specific intelligence on key elements
[3:18:30.200 --> 3:18:33.720]  of the influence campaign the report said.
[3:18:33.720 --> 3:18:37.840]  So they're telling this, again, this exists.
[3:18:37.840 --> 3:18:46.560]  If you listen to the testimony in Senator McCain's hearing, this is an assessment by
[3:18:46.560 --> 3:18:48.320]  the CIA.
[3:18:48.320 --> 3:18:52.400]  This is a briefing from the CIA.
[3:18:52.400 --> 3:19:01.440]  In other words, the guys who lied about Benghazi, lied about Iran-Contra, lied about Vietnam,
[3:19:01.440 --> 3:19:08.320]  lied about the Kennedy assassination, lied about what happened in Guatemala, those guys,
[3:19:08.320 --> 3:19:13.160]  they say the Russians did it, as if they are honest brokers here.
[3:19:13.160 --> 3:19:18.720]  The heads of these intelligence services serve at the pleasure of Barack Obama.
[3:19:18.720 --> 3:19:21.440]  They are all globalists to begin with.
[3:19:21.440 --> 3:19:22.440]  That's how they got to where they are.
[3:19:22.440 --> 3:19:23.440]  This is where they go.
[3:19:23.440 --> 3:19:24.440]  Sorry to cut in.
[3:19:24.440 --> 3:19:26.720]  I just wanted to let you know that Roger, I mean, that Alex asks us to skip the break
[3:19:26.720 --> 3:19:28.520]  so that you'll have more time for this segment.
[3:19:28.520 --> 3:19:31.160]  All right, terrific.
[3:19:31.160 --> 3:19:40.360]  So you are in this fantasy world in which the intelligence agencies have repeatedly
[3:19:40.360 --> 3:19:46.400]  beat this talking point from the Clinton campaign about Russian hacking.
[3:19:46.400 --> 3:19:52.840]  They have yet to produce an iota of proof.
[3:19:52.840 --> 3:19:58.960]  No Republican on the House or Senate Intelligence Committee, people who are qualified to see
[3:19:58.960 --> 3:20:06.280]  classified documents, classified information under some circumstances, has been shown proof
[3:20:06.280 --> 3:20:11.080]  of this alleged Russian hacking.
[3:20:11.080 --> 3:20:24.320]  Now CNN has blown this issue out of all proportion, and I do think that the manner in which the
[3:20:24.320 --> 3:20:32.440]  mass media jumped on this only days before the president's inauguration is disgraceful.
[3:20:32.440 --> 3:20:34.720]  Trump's performance today was an A-plus.
[3:20:34.720 --> 3:20:36.160]  I was very proud of him.
[3:20:36.160 --> 3:20:39.480]  It was Ronald Reagan alike in its quality.
[3:20:39.480 --> 3:20:42.960]  It was Jack Kennedy-like in its humor.
[3:20:42.960 --> 3:20:46.840]  It was Trump-like in its bluntness.
[3:20:46.840 --> 3:20:51.280]  He is committed to peace with Russia, not war.
[3:20:51.280 --> 3:20:57.520]  And if he can have a good relationship with Putin, and that allows us to live in peace
[3:20:57.520 --> 3:21:03.480]  and perhaps use our money instead of building bombs and missiles to rebuild our bridges
[3:21:03.480 --> 3:21:07.920]  and our roads and our schools and our hospitals, well, Donald Trump thinks that would be a
[3:21:07.920 --> 3:21:08.920]  good thing.
[3:21:08.920 --> 3:21:20.720]  And perhaps we can team up to take on ISIS, the neocons who have really been at the center
[3:21:20.720 --> 3:21:30.800]  of power, whether it was Bush or Clinton or Bush or surprisingly then Obama, and who the
[3:21:30.800 --> 3:21:41.720]  insiders had picked either Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton for the next neocon adventurist, globalist
[3:21:41.720 --> 3:21:44.000]  American president.
[3:21:44.000 --> 3:21:52.080]  And unfortunately for the established order, an American came along who is a real American,
[3:21:52.080 --> 3:21:57.720]  a real New Yorker, somebody with the American spirit of confidence.
[3:21:57.720 --> 3:22:00.000]  Obamacare can't repeal it.
[3:22:00.000 --> 3:22:01.000]  Let's see that clip.
[3:22:01.000 --> 3:22:04.120]  I mean, they asked Trump, it can't be done, asked Donald Trump.
[3:22:04.120 --> 3:22:08.160]  Now that, that's, you know, I think a real instinct.
[3:22:08.160 --> 3:22:15.520]  We got that clip.
[3:22:15.520 --> 3:22:20.600]  You're going to be very, very proud as not only the media and reporters, you're going
[3:22:20.600 --> 3:22:25.680]  to be very proud of what we put forth having to do with health care.
[3:22:25.680 --> 3:22:31.640]  Obamacare is a complete and total disaster.
[3:22:31.640 --> 3:22:33.960]  They can say what they want.
[3:22:33.960 --> 3:22:40.760]  They can guide you any way they want to guide you, in some cases, they guide you incorrectly.
[3:22:40.760 --> 3:22:42.760]  In most cases, you realize what's happened.
[3:22:42.760 --> 3:22:45.880]  It's imploding, as we said.
[3:22:45.880 --> 3:22:52.440]  Some states have over 100% increase and 17, and I said this two years ago, 17 is going
[3:22:52.440 --> 3:22:55.160]  to be the bad year.
[3:22:55.160 --> 3:22:56.760]  It's going to be catastrophic.
[3:22:56.760 --> 3:23:02.520]  Frankly, we could sit back and it was a thought from a political standpoint, but it wouldn't
[3:23:02.520 --> 3:23:03.960]  be fair to the people.
[3:23:03.960 --> 3:23:11.560]  We could sit back and wait and watch and criticize, and we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back
[3:23:11.560 --> 3:23:18.000]  and criticize it, and people would come, they would come begging to us, please, we have
[3:23:18.000 --> 3:23:21.120]  to do something about Obamacare.
[3:23:21.120 --> 3:23:22.400]  We don't want to own it.
[3:23:22.400 --> 3:23:24.240]  We don't want to own it politically.
[3:23:24.240 --> 3:23:26.000]  They own it right now.
[3:23:26.000 --> 3:23:31.680]  So the easiest thing would be to let it implode in 17, and believe me, we'd get pretty much
[3:23:31.680 --> 3:23:34.480]  whatever we wanted, but it would take a long time.
[3:23:34.480 --> 3:23:42.520]  We're going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary is approved, almost simultaneously,
[3:23:42.520 --> 3:23:46.400]  shortly thereafter, a plan.
[3:23:46.400 --> 3:23:50.640]  It'll be repeal and replace.
[3:23:50.640 --> 3:23:54.280]  It will be essentially simultaneously.
[3:23:54.280 --> 3:23:59.600]  It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or
[3:23:59.600 --> 3:24:04.040]  the same week, but probably the same day, could be the same hour.
[3:24:04.040 --> 3:24:05.400]  So we're going to do repeal and replace.
[3:24:05.400 --> 3:24:10.760]  It's very complicated stuff, and we're going to get a health bill passed.
[3:24:10.760 --> 3:24:13.480]  We're going to get health care taken care of in this country.
[3:24:13.480 --> 3:24:20.120]  You have deductibles that are so high that after people go broke paying their premiums,
[3:24:20.120 --> 3:24:24.600]  which are going through the roof, the health care can't even be used by them because the
[3:24:24.600 --> 3:24:27.160]  deductibles are so high.
[3:24:27.160 --> 3:24:32.040]  Obamacare is the Democrats' problem.
[3:24:32.040 --> 3:24:36.040]  We are going to take the problem off the shelves for them.
[3:24:36.040 --> 3:24:40.040]  We're doing them a tremendous service by doing it.
[3:24:40.040 --> 3:24:44.880]  We could sit back and let them hang with it.
[3:24:44.880 --> 3:24:47.800]  We are doing the Democrats a great service.
[3:24:47.800 --> 3:24:56.320]  So as soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office, we'll be filing a plan,
[3:24:56.320 --> 3:25:02.240]  and it was actually pretty accurately reported today, the New York Times, and the plan will
[3:25:02.240 --> 3:25:06.120]  be repeal and replace Obamacare.
[3:25:06.120 --> 3:25:14.200]  We're going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better.
[3:25:14.200 --> 3:25:31.200]  All right, so that was pretty extraordinary.
[3:25:31.200 --> 3:25:35.600]  The real point here, of course, is that Trump gets the big picture, and he's going to push
[3:25:35.600 --> 3:25:41.040]  back against the fake news, against CNN, particularly the New York Times, the Washington
[3:25:41.040 --> 3:25:47.720]  Post, anyone who is out there trying to dictate a narrative that is detrimental to both Trump
[3:25:47.720 --> 3:25:50.320]  and the country, Trump's clearly going to call them out.
[3:25:50.320 --> 3:25:54.200]  Look at this piece with Jim Acosta of CNN.
[3:25:54.200 --> 3:25:59.720]  Information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public.
[3:25:59.720 --> 3:26:06.800]  As far as Buzzfeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they're going
[3:26:06.800 --> 3:26:08.200]  to suffer the consequences.
[3:26:08.200 --> 3:26:14.320]  They already are, and as far as CNN, going out of their way to build it up.
[3:26:14.320 --> 3:26:16.880]  And by the way, we just found out I was coming down, Michael Cohn.
[3:26:16.880 --> 3:26:20.600]  I was being, Michael Cohn is a very talented lawyer, he's a good lawyer in my firm.
[3:26:20.600 --> 3:26:24.280]  It was just reported that it wasn't this Michael Cohn they were talking about.
[3:26:24.280 --> 3:26:26.600]  So all night long, it's Michael Cohn.
[3:26:26.600 --> 3:26:28.680]  I said, I want to see your passport.
[3:26:28.680 --> 3:26:31.000]  He brings his passport to my office.
[3:26:31.000 --> 3:26:33.320]  I said, hey, wait a minute, he didn't leave the country.
[3:26:33.320 --> 3:26:34.640]  He wasn't out of the country.
[3:26:34.640 --> 3:26:39.760]  They had Michael Cohn, if the Trump Organization wasn't proud, it turned out to be a different
[3:26:39.760 --> 3:26:40.880]  Michael Cohn.
[3:26:40.880 --> 3:26:42.760]  It's a disgrace what took place.
[3:26:42.760 --> 3:26:44.000]  It's a disgrace.
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:47.200]  And I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohn.
[3:26:47.200 --> 3:26:49.720]  Sir, since you're attacking us, can you give us a question?
[3:26:49.720 --> 3:26:50.720]  Go ahead.
[3:26:50.720 --> 3:26:51.720]  No, Mr. President-Elect.
[3:26:51.720 --> 3:26:52.720]  Go ahead.
[3:26:52.720 --> 3:26:53.720]  Go ahead.
[3:26:53.720 --> 3:26:56.240]  Since you are attacking our news organization, can you give us a chance?
[3:26:56.240 --> 3:26:57.240]  Your organization is terrible.
[3:26:57.240 --> 3:26:58.240]  You are attacking our news organization.
[3:26:58.240 --> 3:26:59.240]  Your organization is terrible.
[3:26:59.240 --> 3:27:00.880]  Can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir?
[3:27:00.880 --> 3:27:01.880]  Go ahead.
[3:27:01.880 --> 3:27:02.880]  Sir, can you state?
[3:27:02.880 --> 3:27:03.880]  Quiet.
[3:27:03.880 --> 3:27:04.880]  Can you state?
[3:27:04.880 --> 3:27:05.880]  Can you ask any question?
[3:27:05.880 --> 3:27:06.880]  Don't be rude.
[3:27:06.880 --> 3:27:07.880]  Mr. President-Elect, can you give us a question?
[3:27:07.880 --> 3:27:08.880]  Don't be rude.
[3:27:08.880 --> 3:27:09.880]  Thank you.
[3:27:09.880 --> 3:27:10.880]  Can you give us a question?
[3:27:10.880 --> 3:27:11.880]  Don't be rude.
[3:27:11.880 --> 3:27:12.880]  No, I'm not going to give you a question.
[3:27:12.880 --> 3:27:13.880]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[3:27:13.880 --> 3:27:14.880]  Can you state?
[3:27:14.880 --> 3:27:15.880]  Can you state?
[3:27:15.880 --> 3:27:16.880]  You are fake news.
[3:27:16.880 --> 3:27:17.880]  Sir.
[3:27:17.880 --> 3:27:18.880]  All right.
[3:27:18.880 --> 3:27:19.880]  There it is.
[3:27:19.880 --> 3:27:20.880]  There it is.
[3:27:20.880 --> 3:27:25.280]  Donald J. Trump, the gut puncher, an extraordinary clip there.
[3:27:25.280 --> 3:27:32.040]  I think it shows you how Trump is going to push back against the media.
[3:27:32.040 --> 3:27:39.480]  I want to talk to you for just a moment about how you can both help the fight for freedom,
[3:27:39.480 --> 3:27:45.080]  help keep the independent investigative journalism here at Infowars.com, which has really been
[3:27:45.080 --> 3:27:50.640]  on the cutting edge of the Trump campaign and the inside story of how this momentous
[3:27:50.640 --> 3:27:51.640]  election happened.
[3:27:51.640 --> 3:27:56.360]  And at the same time, you can benefit yourself incredibly.
[3:27:56.360 --> 3:28:03.600]  I have recently been ill, which I'm feeling much better, I'm happy to say, but without
[3:28:03.600 --> 3:28:10.040]  the silver bullet product specifically, the silver colloidal product sold at the Info
[3:28:10.040 --> 3:28:18.320]  War Store, as well as the DNA force, which is actually back in stock, I don't think
[3:28:18.320 --> 3:28:21.840]  it would have been as quickly back on my feet.
[3:28:21.840 --> 3:28:23.440]  These products really work.
[3:28:23.440 --> 3:28:25.380]  I rely on them.
[3:28:25.380 --> 3:28:31.720]  In my case, I have taken herbs and supplements, I've been treated with acupuncture and eastern
[3:28:31.720 --> 3:28:35.040]  medicine for 50, 60 years.
[3:28:35.040 --> 3:28:41.920]  I have used a variety of these natural products, and I can tell you, Alex Jones doesn't put
[3:28:41.920 --> 3:28:50.120]  anything for sale at his store, that he doesn't have thousands and thousands of people saying,
[3:28:50.120 --> 3:28:57.280]  Alex, this stuff really works, a colleague of mine was a reporter.
[3:28:57.280 --> 3:28:59.800]  Because of that, he was sitting down all day.
[3:28:59.800 --> 3:29:03.040]  He developed prostate problems.
[3:29:03.040 --> 3:29:05.440]  He went to an expensive urologist.
[3:29:05.440 --> 3:29:09.400]  The urologist essentially said, well, there's not much we can do for you other than put
[3:29:09.400 --> 3:29:10.840]  you on painkillers.
[3:29:10.840 --> 3:29:17.400]  I recommended Prostagard, and his problem literally disappeared in a few days.
[3:29:17.400 --> 3:29:22.880]  So folks, there are specials on these products at InfoWars store now.
[3:29:22.880 --> 3:29:27.480]  I really urge you to take advantage of a lot of the discounts that are up.
[3:29:27.480 --> 3:29:55.720]  You can help the fight for freedom and stand tall with InfoWars.
[3:30:27.480 --> 3:30:38.960]  Trump went on to say that the fake stream news media has destroyed lives, and all he
[3:30:38.960 --> 3:30:52.000]  wants is honest reporters.
[3:30:52.000 --> 3:30:59.000]  And you can watch more highlights from Donald Trump's press conference right now at InfoWars.com.
[3:31:52.000 --> 3:32:06.760]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.

[3:32:11.400 --> 3:32:14.920]  tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[3:32:14.920 --> 3:32:19.640]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[3:32:19.640 --> 3:32:24.200]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our
[3:32:24.200 --> 3:32:25.680]  modern diets.
[3:32:25.680 --> 3:32:30.800]  Secret 12 by InfoWars Live is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake
[3:32:30.800 --> 3:32:33.220]  and support your body's natural systems.
[3:32:33.220 --> 3:32:38.200]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[3:32:38.200 --> 3:32:42.000]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding
[3:32:42.000 --> 3:32:47.360]  in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[3:32:47.360 --> 3:32:51.040]  Apply your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[3:32:51.040 --> 3:33:21.000]  It's the power of Secret 12 at InfoWarsLive.com, that's InfoWarsLive.com.
[3:33:22.000 --> 3:33:28.600]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:33:28.600 --> 3:33:32.600]  What could be more perfect music for me, ZZ Top?
[3:33:32.600 --> 3:33:36.720]  Guys, three guys made a lot of music for just three pieces.
[3:33:36.720 --> 3:33:41.000]  Some real hardcore Texas guitar there, outstanding.
[3:33:41.000 --> 3:33:47.400]  I'm back with you, happy to sit in for my friend Alex Jones while he's on vacation.
[3:33:47.400 --> 3:33:53.720]  It's an epic day, truly I think a historic day.
[3:33:53.720 --> 3:34:01.000]  We are at the tipping point here in terms of the forces of liberty, the forces of freedom,
[3:34:01.000 --> 3:34:08.760]  the forces against globalism on the rise, a savior, a champion has arisen from the
[3:34:08.760 --> 3:34:11.400]  most unlikeliest place.
[3:34:11.400 --> 3:34:20.240]  As I write in my upcoming book, The Making of the President 2016, how Donald Trump orchestrated
[3:34:20.240 --> 3:34:26.880]  an American Revolution, it was former President Richard Nixon who first realized the possibilities
[3:34:26.880 --> 3:34:30.400]  of a Trump presidency.
[3:34:30.400 --> 3:34:38.360]  Trump has nobody to, I should say, no one deserves credit for this victory more than
[3:34:38.360 --> 3:34:40.480]  he does.
[3:34:40.480 --> 3:34:46.640]  This was a marathon in which he took on all the derision and the massive spending and
[3:34:46.640 --> 3:34:53.640]  the beating that he took from the mainstream media and he persevered.
[3:34:53.640 --> 3:35:01.400]  I asked you, having just turned in the manuscript of 149,000 words to Skyhorse, this book should
[3:35:01.400 --> 3:35:05.480]  be out around the 31st of January.
[3:35:05.480 --> 3:35:12.760]  It really I think is the definitive account of how Donald Trump pulled off the greatest
[3:35:12.760 --> 3:35:15.960]  political upset in American times.
[3:35:15.960 --> 3:35:24.160]  Now, to a certain extent I've had deja vu all over again just prior to the vote of the
[3:35:24.160 --> 3:35:35.520]  Electoral College, who pops up again but John Podesta claiming incorrectly that I both knew
[3:35:35.520 --> 3:35:46.240]  in advance of the hacking of his email and the claim that because I predicted an onslaught
[3:35:46.240 --> 3:35:52.280]  from WikiLeaks and Assange, an onslaught that actually took place, that I must have
[3:35:52.280 --> 3:35:57.080]  known in advance about the content of that.
[3:35:57.080 --> 3:36:07.560]  So I say again that in August of the election year, one must remember the context.
[3:36:07.560 --> 3:36:12.840]  Paul Manafort is under relentless phony attack by the Clinton people.
[3:36:12.840 --> 3:36:19.600]  I am well aware of Podesta's money laundering activities in Eastern Europe through my own
[3:36:19.600 --> 3:36:21.440]  network of sources.
[3:36:21.440 --> 3:36:28.800]  I produce a major story to which I refer at Stone Cold Truth regarding money laundering
[3:36:28.800 --> 3:36:36.840]  the Russian mob and the Podesta brothers and none of that information demonstrably comes
[3:36:36.840 --> 3:36:39.000]  from WikiLeaks.
[3:36:39.000 --> 3:36:40.560]  Strike one.
[3:36:40.560 --> 3:36:41.800]  Strike two.
[3:36:41.800 --> 3:36:49.360]  On October 5th, I say that Assange is going to unload on Hillary that her campaign is over
[3:36:49.360 --> 3:36:53.440]  while the beginning of the end is over.
[3:36:53.440 --> 3:37:01.440]  I base this, as I have said a thousand times, on a comment by a mutual friend who has been
[3:37:01.440 --> 3:37:08.080]  in communications with Assange and is also in communications with me.
[3:37:08.080 --> 3:37:14.120]  And what I am told is that he has unspecified political dynamite, information that will
[3:37:14.120 --> 3:37:19.840]  royal the race and could adversely affect Hillary Clinton.
[3:37:19.840 --> 3:37:25.640]  Now if one will go on the public record, Assange has said that on the record several
[3:37:25.640 --> 3:37:29.960]  times just prior to my receiving this message.
[3:37:29.960 --> 3:37:38.640]  That does not mean that I at any time knew the substance of his disclosures, the timing
[3:37:38.640 --> 3:37:48.520]  of his disclosures, he did announce on the 5th that he would, little Marco Rubio there
[3:37:48.520 --> 3:37:59.320]  for you, he did disclose that he would take part as it went forward.
[3:37:59.320 --> 3:38:09.640]  So this is again Assange said he would have 10 releases I believe on October 5th, one
[3:38:09.640 --> 3:38:14.000]  a week, for 10 weeks, and he was good to his word.
[3:38:14.000 --> 3:38:19.960]  But the insinuation that I had any advance knowledge of content or timing is also false.
[3:38:19.960 --> 3:38:29.160]  Now my problem here is yet again that all of these arguments were made by Mr. Podesta
[3:38:29.160 --> 3:38:36.200]  and amplified by the mainstream media who afford me no opportunity to respond.
[3:38:36.200 --> 3:38:42.720]  They lose the election, the electoral college is over, Trump is forming a cabinet and now
[3:38:42.720 --> 3:38:50.080]  Podesta goes back to the Washington Post and recycles the same crap again.
[3:38:50.080 --> 3:38:54.240]  It was false then, it is false now.
[3:38:54.240 --> 3:39:02.640]  But if one will go on Twitter or Facebook, they will see the mindless bots paid for by
[3:39:02.640 --> 3:39:09.600]  George Soros run by that pathetic loser David Brock constantly saying over and over again
[3:39:09.600 --> 3:39:18.440]  Roger Stone knew this is proof that Stone told his friend Trump as one news organ just
[3:39:18.440 --> 3:39:26.040]  flatly said as Mr. Podesta said and they reported Stone could have told Trump or must have told
[3:39:26.040 --> 3:39:27.040]  Trump.
[3:39:27.040 --> 3:39:31.680]  Stone didn't tell Trump because Stone didn't know anything yet.
[3:39:31.680 --> 3:39:39.720]  Another opportunity to clarify that yet if you go on Twitter you'll see mindless bots.
[3:39:39.720 --> 3:39:49.160]  Roger Stone knew Alex Jones was, I mean it is sophomoric what we have come to.
[3:39:49.160 --> 3:39:53.400]  I hope that many of you are planning to go to the inauguration.
[3:39:53.400 --> 3:40:00.880]  The thing to have is the Trump is my president t-shirt which you can grab at Info Wars.
[3:40:00.880 --> 3:40:06.680]  Now the night of the deplorable, we'll talk a little more about that later, which is kind
[3:40:06.680 --> 3:40:09.760]  of the people celebration of the Trump victory.
[3:40:09.760 --> 3:40:16.400]  This is where the hard core are going to gather, Alex Jones is speaking, I'm honored to have
[3:40:16.400 --> 3:40:22.960]  been asked to speak, the great Mike Cernovich, a good lineup of pro-liberty, pro-Trump, Trump
[3:40:22.960 --> 3:40:27.920]  supporting Americans, it's going to be a great event in all honesty.
[3:40:27.920 --> 3:40:33.960]  We have gotten intelligence reports of radical organizations talking about disrupting this
[3:40:33.960 --> 3:40:45.040]  event, harassing attendees, using Alinsky tactics, throwing baggies of Clorox or urine, trying
[3:40:45.040 --> 3:40:48.240]  to incite violence, confusion.
[3:40:48.240 --> 3:40:53.720]  First of all let me show those of you who are going to the ball, there will be adequate
[3:40:53.720 --> 3:40:59.720]  security and precautions are being made so we can have a peaceful assembly in the celebration
[3:40:59.720 --> 3:41:01.760]  of the Trump victory.
[3:41:01.760 --> 3:41:07.720]  But this is I think part and parcel of a much broader and more dangerous effort that is
[3:41:07.720 --> 3:41:16.000]  afoot and that is to turn Washington DC into Chicago 1968.
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:21.080]  This is what I think the radical left and Soros whose checkbook seems to be endless
[3:41:21.080 --> 3:41:22.920]  have an appetite for.
[3:41:22.920 --> 3:41:28.280]  So we're talking about massive disruption, people laying down in the streets, people
[3:41:28.280 --> 3:41:34.040]  chaining themselves to public accommodations, people assaulting people coming off of public
[3:41:34.040 --> 3:41:42.080]  transportation, agitating, trying to create a crisis atmosphere, tear gas canisters we
[3:41:42.080 --> 3:41:46.280]  think will be deployed, other poisons could be deployed.
[3:41:46.280 --> 3:41:53.880]  This is an attempt at anarchy and to mar what I think is shaping up to be a great although
[3:41:53.880 --> 3:41:58.560]  be it somewhat disorganized inaugural.
[3:41:58.560 --> 3:42:04.560]  The president now going to drop by three inaugural balls by tradition, this is where Jack Kennedy
[3:42:04.560 --> 3:42:11.760]  dazzled everybody without a hat and a parade of course as is traditional.
[3:42:11.760 --> 3:42:17.880]  The swearing in most Americans don't realize is not controlled by President elect Trump
[3:42:17.880 --> 3:42:23.640]  or his entourage it is controlled by the US Congress it's a federal proceeding.
[3:42:23.640 --> 3:42:30.080]  The Trump entourage gets a certain set number of seated and standing tickets for the swearing
[3:42:30.080 --> 3:42:37.320]  in ceremony but the Congress awards some of these to the public they award some of them
[3:42:37.320 --> 3:42:43.880]  not award them but they give them to the Supreme Court to the US Senate obviously to members
[3:42:43.880 --> 3:42:50.960]  of the House to former members of the House to the diplomatic corps and so on.
[3:42:50.960 --> 3:42:55.600]  We are hoping for good weather which is really the key to a great inaugural.
[3:42:55.600 --> 3:43:01.920]  We have not had great weather in recent inaugurals and it can be very bitter in Washington during
[3:43:01.920 --> 3:43:09.720]  this time so if you are coming number one take your silver bullet because that stuff
[3:43:09.720 --> 3:43:15.040]  or I think really pumps up your immunity but wear a warm coat wear a hat ladies fur
[3:43:15.040 --> 3:43:18.560]  is okay we're Republicans it's perfectly all right.
[3:43:18.560 --> 3:43:26.040]  I think it's going to be a great great celebration and I think it's going to be very ad hoc.
[3:43:26.040 --> 3:43:33.800]  There's a great America ball that is more low cost on the 20th as well as all these
[3:43:33.800 --> 3:43:42.360]  official events I think there are still plans for a pro-Trump counter protest at the Washington
[3:43:42.360 --> 3:43:49.120]  Monument the National Park Service is arguing with activists who we are friendly with there
[3:43:49.120 --> 3:43:55.040]  will be entertainment at the deplorable so by all means this kind of revolution only
[3:43:55.040 --> 3:44:06.040]  happens once a millennium this is it for the United States this is our last best hope
[3:44:06.040 --> 3:44:14.120]  for freedom we are either going to continue down the path of the neocon globalists whose
[3:44:14.120 --> 3:44:20.440]  real sin is not that they ran the country into the ditch not that they robbed the American
[3:44:20.440 --> 3:44:26.280]  people of their wealth and their prosperity and their security it's that they and their
[3:44:26.280 --> 3:44:34.360]  cronies made millions if not billions while causing this misery to the American people
[3:44:34.360 --> 3:44:39.560]  so we're not talking just about inefficient or incompetent government we're talking about
[3:44:39.560 --> 3:44:48.440]  greed the ideology of the bush clinton bush combine and their elitist friends and followers
[3:44:48.440 --> 3:44:55.320]  at the council on foreign relations or the trilateral commission or any of these elitist
[3:44:55.320 --> 3:45:03.400]  foreign policy organizations where you have old money and old intelligence ties they have
[3:45:03.400 --> 3:45:12.240]  they have finally worn out their welcome with the American people the shifting paradigm here
[3:45:12.240 --> 3:45:20.000]  is based on the fact that for the first time in this election a majority voters has finally
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:26.280]  realized that the mainstream media's job is to cover up for the establishment not report
[3:45:26.280 --> 3:45:33.480]  on them you see this is the exact reverse of watergate in watergate richard nixon and his men
[3:45:33.480 --> 3:45:40.040]  did some illegal things and they kept the lid on them for almost a year but the washington post
[3:45:40.760 --> 3:45:47.400]  and the new york times both engaged in very aggressive investigative reporting
[3:45:47.400 --> 3:46:03.480]  tip of the hat to senator rubio in this case you have the the failed intelligence agencies trying
[3:46:03.480 --> 3:46:11.080]  desperately for the last time to to push a narrative on the american people which is no
[3:46:11.080 --> 3:46:19.240]  longer possible the shift in in in media attention of the american people hasn't led directly to a
[3:46:19.240 --> 3:46:26.600]  revolution that they could not foresee now they hysterically tried to restore their grip but it's
[3:46:26.600 --> 3:46:33.960]  too late the forces of freedom and a reformer who is outside their elitist clique has become president
[3:46:33.960 --> 3:46:42.200]  uh let us uh let us look at the next president united states here for a moment do you trust
[3:46:42.200 --> 3:46:47.400]  your u.s. intelligence officials and what do you say to foreign policy experts who say you're
[3:46:47.400 --> 3:46:54.040]  actually weakening national security by waging this war of words against that community intelligence
[3:46:54.040 --> 3:46:59.560]  agencies are vital and very very important we are going to be putting in as you know
[3:46:59.560 --> 3:47:05.720]  Mr. Pompeo and others you know the senator dan coats we're going to be putting in some
[3:47:05.720 --> 3:47:12.760]  outstanding people within 90 days they're going to be coming back to me with a major report on
[3:47:12.760 --> 3:47:20.040]  hacking i want them to cover this situation i also want them however to cover maybe most
[3:47:20.040 --> 3:47:31.000]  importantly because we're hacked by everybody that includes russia and china and everybody
[3:47:32.440 --> 3:47:38.520]  you said just now that you believe that russia indeed was responsible for the hacking of the dnc
[3:47:38.520 --> 3:47:43.960]  and onto this is emails etc but you know what could have been others also but why did you spend weeks
[3:47:43.960 --> 3:47:49.320]  undermining u.s. intelligence community before simply getting the facts and then making a public
[3:47:49.320 --> 3:47:54.200]  well i think it's pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press i think it's
[3:47:54.200 --> 3:48:00.520]  pretty sad first of all it's illegal you know these are these are classified and certified
[3:48:00.520 --> 3:48:06.920]  meetings and reports i'll tell you what does happen i have many meetings with intelligence and
[3:48:07.880 --> 3:48:12.120]  every time i meet people are reading about it somebody's leaking it out
[3:48:12.120 --> 3:48:21.320]  uh there you go the unvarnished donald trump uh who i think gets it they lied about ben gazi they
[3:48:22.040 --> 3:48:28.680]  lied about uh iran contra they lied about the vietnam war they lied about the kennedy assassination
[3:48:28.680 --> 3:48:36.520]  they lied about the coups in guatemala and what they did in chile uh the cia cia is about lying
[3:48:36.520 --> 3:48:43.320]  uh and in in this particular case the fact that the drumbeat is being led by the cia director
[3:48:43.320 --> 3:48:51.880]  john brennan a man who converted from catholicism to radical wahabism a man who speaks the language
[3:48:52.520 --> 3:48:59.960]  uh and has a long history of activity in the american communist party the man i believe
[3:48:59.960 --> 3:49:09.720]  uh cleanse barack obama's uh passport records uh in his reelection campaign uh this nut case
[3:49:09.720 --> 3:49:16.120]  is among those saying oh you know the russians hacked it he's a partisan he's a hack and trump
[3:49:16.120 --> 3:49:22.840]  needs to replace him uh then you have mike uh uh morrell the former acting director
[3:49:23.800 --> 3:49:29.160]  another guy in the cheerleading saying the russians hacked the election this is the same
[3:49:29.160 --> 3:49:35.720]  guy who lied about ben gazi and he's now on the payroll of some clinton connected pr firm
[3:49:35.720 --> 3:49:44.280]  he's a stooge why would anyone believe him yet another hack these are the the uh intelligence
[3:49:44.280 --> 3:49:52.760]  experts who are giving us this line of of bull uh and 29 percent of the people uh are buying it and
[3:49:52.760 --> 3:49:59.320]  no one else you know i've been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news and they're
[3:49:59.320 --> 3:50:04.440]  talking about people that go and say all sorts of things but i will tell you some of the media
[3:50:04.440 --> 3:50:09.160]  outlets that i deal with the fake news more so than anybody i could name them but i won't bother
[3:50:09.160 --> 3:50:16.440]  but you have few sitting right in front of us uh so they're very very dishonest people but uh i
[3:50:16.440 --> 3:50:20.360]  think it's just something we're gonna have to live with i guess the advantage i have is that
[3:50:20.360 --> 3:50:27.400]  that i can speak back when it happens to somebody that doesn't have this doesn't have that kind of
[3:50:27.400 --> 3:50:33.240]  a megaphone they can't speak back it's a very sad thing i've seen people destroyed i've seen people
[3:50:33.240 --> 3:50:40.280]  absolutely destroyed and i think it's very unfair so all i can ask for is honest reporters yes
[3:50:40.280 --> 3:50:51.240]  there you have it donald trump right in the face right in the grill of the fake news we'll be right

[3:55:12.760 --> 3:55:20.040]  am extremely careful I'm surrounded by bodyguards I'm surrounded by people and I always tell them
[3:55:20.040 --> 3:55:27.240]  anywhere but I always tell them if I'm leaving this country be very careful because in your
[3:55:27.240 --> 3:55:32.040]  hotel rooms and no matter where you go you're going to probably have cameras I'm not referring
[3:55:32.040 --> 3:55:37.400]  just to Russia but I would certainly put them in that category and number one I hope you're
[3:55:37.400 --> 3:55:43.400]  going to be good anyway but in those rooms you have cameras in the strangest places cameras that
[3:55:43.400 --> 3:55:50.440]  are so small with modern technology you can't see them and you won't know you better be careful
[3:55:51.000 --> 3:55:59.000]  or you'll be watching yourself on nightly television I tell this to people all the time
[3:55:59.000 --> 3:56:06.680]  I was in Russia years ago with the Miss Universe Contest which did very well Moscow the Moscow area
[3:56:07.240 --> 3:56:14.840]  did very very well and I told many people be careful because you don't want to see yourself
[3:56:14.840 --> 3:56:19.400]  on television cameras all over the place and again not just Russia all over
[3:56:19.400 --> 3:56:30.120]  there again Donald Trump a man of I think extreme sophistication always been realistic about
[3:56:30.120 --> 3:56:36.600]  security precautions a man of great discretion and savvy that's why this charge that he
[3:56:37.480 --> 3:56:45.960]  partied with a group of women who who either urinated on him or for him is an outrageous
[3:56:45.960 --> 3:56:52.040]  insult this is a fabrication I have known the man personally for 40 years I've known his pair I knew
[3:56:52.040 --> 3:56:59.720]  his parents well Fred and Mary attended both of their funerals I knew his brother-in-law John Berry
[3:56:59.720 --> 3:57:07.640]  very able Republican lawyer in New Jersey and I am a good friend of the judge Mary Ann Trump
[3:57:07.640 --> 3:57:16.920]  Berry who is a fine jurist put on the bench by Ronald Reagan so I know the Trump character
[3:57:18.120 --> 3:57:23.720]  yes he is a man with an eye if you're beautiful women but these charges are not him it is not
[3:57:23.720 --> 3:57:32.200]  something that he would do these are as bogus as the trumped up fake Epstein rape charges
[3:57:32.200 --> 3:57:39.640]  which collapsed at the end of the campaign a woman who alleged without her name ever being used that
[3:57:40.440 --> 3:57:50.200]  she had been raped by Epstein and Trump together in Epstein's home zero chance and of course as
[3:57:50.200 --> 3:57:55.800]  you probably know the woman in question disappeared from sight at the end of the campaign and withdrew
[3:57:55.800 --> 3:58:03.880]  her lawsuit this was the last line of defense of the Clintonistas who knew in the Epstein issue
[3:58:04.440 --> 3:58:13.080]  Bill had real liability so that's the inside story thanks for joining us here at info wars and
[3:58:13.080 --> 3:58:18.520]  I will see you in a few days in the meantime stand tall for the Trump revolution you're at the
[3:58:18.520 --> 3:58:34.440]  cutting edge of the resistance here at info wars
[3:58:34.440 --> 3:58:45.560]  this is GCN the genesis communications radio network
