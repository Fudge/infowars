[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Article 1, abuse of power.
[00:11.000 --> 00:14.640]  The Constitution provides that the House of Representatives shall have the sole power
[00:14.640 --> 00:19.080]  of impeachment and that the President shall be removed from office on impeachment for
[00:19.080 --> 00:24.400]  and conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.
[00:24.400 --> 00:28.480]  In his conduct of the office of President of the United States and in violation of
[00:28.480 --> 00:33.600]  his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States
[00:33.600 --> 00:38.160]  and to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the
[00:38.160 --> 00:43.440]  United States and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully
[00:43.440 --> 00:49.680]  executed, Donald J. Trump has abused the powers of the Presidency in that, using the powers
[00:49.680 --> 00:55.240]  of his high office, President Trump solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine,
[00:55.240 --> 00:58.720]  in the 2020 United States presidential election.
[00:58.720 --> 01:03.040]  He did so through a scheme or a course of conduct that included soliciting the government of
[01:03.040 --> 01:08.440]  Ukraine to publicly announce investigations that would benefit his reelection, harm the
[01:08.440 --> 01:13.920]  election prospects of his political opponent, and influence the 2020 United States presidential
[01:13.920 --> 01:14.920]  election.
[01:14.920 --> 01:15.920]  We're live.
[01:15.920 --> 01:16.920]  President Trump.
[01:16.920 --> 01:19.520]  Right as the broadcast started.
[01:19.520 --> 01:20.520]  To take these steps.
[01:20.520 --> 01:25.000]  They had the vote two minutes ago completed to initiate the official impeachment.
[01:25.000 --> 01:33.000]  Now they're reading the charges, into the record, and they're going to vote the jury
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.040]  that's the House, is going to vote on these charges.
[01:37.040 --> 01:41.000]  President Trump used the powers of the Presidency in a manner that compromised the national
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.680]  security of the United States and undermined the integrity of the United States democratic
[01:45.680 --> 01:47.080]  process.
[01:47.080 --> 01:50.000]  He thus ignored and injured the interests of the nation.
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.920]  The grand jury voting on indictment, basically, or course of conduct through the following
[01:54.920 --> 01:55.920]  means.
[01:55.920 --> 01:59.400]  One, President Trump acting both directly and through his agents within and outside
[01:59.400 --> 02:04.800]  the United States government, corruptly solicited the government of Ukraine to publicly announce
[02:04.800 --> 02:10.920]  investigations into a political opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
[02:10.920 --> 02:16.840]  and be a discredited theory promoted by Russia, alleging that Ukraine rather than Russia interfered
[02:16.840 --> 02:20.240]  in the 2016 United States presidential election.
[02:20.240 --> 02:24.840]  Two, with the same corrupt motives, President Trump acting both directly and through his
[02:24.840 --> 02:30.160]  agents within and outside the United States government, conditioned two official acts
[02:30.160 --> 02:33.200]  on the public announcements that he had requested.
[02:33.200 --> 02:37.960]  A, the release of $391 million of United States taxpayer.
[02:37.960 --> 02:40.520]  This has only happened a few other times in history.
[02:40.520 --> 02:42.000]  To count on one hand.
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.120]  The purpose of providing vital military and security assistance to Ukraine to oppose Russian
[02:47.120 --> 02:50.840]  aggression in which President Trump had ordered suspended.
[02:50.840 --> 02:55.840]  And B, a head of state meeting at the White House, which the president of Ukraine sought
[02:55.840 --> 03:00.720]  to demonstrate, continued United States support for the government of Ukraine in the face
[03:00.720 --> 03:01.720]  of Russian aggression.
[03:01.720 --> 03:03.600]  Remember a few months ago?
[03:03.600 --> 03:05.080]  Faced with the public revelation.
[03:05.080 --> 03:06.880]  Folks said this could never happen.
[03:06.880 --> 03:11.000]  President Trump ultimately released the military and security assistance to the government
[03:11.000 --> 03:12.000]  of Ukraine.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.000]  This is treason.
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.760]  But has persisted in openly and corruptly urging and soliciting Ukraine.
[03:15.760 --> 03:20.080]  As Professor Turley said, what they're doing is the crime.
[03:20.080 --> 03:23.120]  These actions were consistent with President Trump's previous investigation.
[03:23.120 --> 03:26.920]  The house has been a sham in United States elections.
[03:26.920 --> 03:31.280]  In all of this, President Trump abused the powers of the presidency by ignoring and injuring
[03:31.280 --> 03:32.280]  national security.
[03:32.280 --> 03:33.280]  And yes, it's going to blow up in their face.
[03:33.280 --> 03:34.280]  Other vital national interest.
[03:34.280 --> 03:38.080]  It shows what bold criminals they are and how they need to be stopped.
[03:38.080 --> 03:41.160]  He has also betrayed the nation by abusing his high office to...
[03:41.160 --> 03:45.360]  Because if Trump and America makes it out of this...
[03:45.360 --> 03:48.680]  Without civil unrest that they're pushing for to tear the nation apart, what are they
[03:48.680 --> 03:52.160]  going to pull next?
[03:52.160 --> 03:54.160]  They keep escalating the level.
[03:54.160 --> 03:59.440]  And has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law.
[03:59.440 --> 04:03.040]  President Trump thus warrants impeachment and trial removal from office...
[04:03.040 --> 04:04.040]  Total projection.
[04:04.040 --> 04:06.120] ...is qualification to hold and enjoy any...
[04:06.120 --> 04:10.200]  Everything the Democrats are saying under the United States is what they've done.
[04:10.200 --> 04:11.720] ...article two, obstruction of Congress.
[04:11.720 --> 04:17.360]  And that's the clerk reading and it's not him, but those that wrote it, Pelosi, Schiff,
[04:17.360 --> 04:22.280]  and that the president shall be removed from office on impeachment for in conviction of
[04:22.280 --> 04:25.120]  treason, bribery, or other high crimes.
[04:25.120 --> 04:26.640]  So it's here, folks.
[04:26.640 --> 04:29.400] ...in his conduct of the office of the president of the United States...
[04:29.400 --> 04:35.960]  They voted just five minutes ago, literally, faithfully, to have the vote today.
[04:35.960 --> 04:38.040]  And they've got the votes.
[04:38.040 --> 04:45.400]  So it's on, on this Wednesday, December 18, 2019, global transmission, and we're going
[04:45.400 --> 04:51.880]  to have live coverage of this as America fights back against the globalist that have hijacked
[04:51.880 --> 04:52.880]  our nation.
[04:52.880 --> 04:59.480]  How dare them claim Trump is against America?
[04:59.480 --> 05:06.320]  It's your last chance to get the original designer, limited edition Jeffrey Epstein Christmas
[05:06.320 --> 05:07.320]  Sweater.
[05:07.320 --> 05:11.920]  The globalists are so scared of this story continuing to come out for people learning
[05:11.920 --> 05:17.360]  about the deep state and the international blackmail rings, using kidnapped women and
[05:17.360 --> 05:20.600]  children to compromise world leaders.
[05:20.600 --> 05:26.480]  They do not want this story continuing, and this is your last chance to get the limited
[05:26.480 --> 05:31.280]  edition Christmas sweater at infowarstore.com to help spread the word, to have a piece of
[05:31.280 --> 05:33.440]  history, and to fund our operation.
[05:33.440 --> 05:37.840]  So again, it says Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein, that these things don't hang
[05:37.840 --> 05:39.960]  themselves on the front, on the back.
[05:39.960 --> 05:45.640]  It's got infowars.com and shows the O in info wars as a wreath that's also a noose.
[05:45.640 --> 05:49.320]  The system can't stand it when you promote things at the grassroots level.
[05:49.320 --> 05:53.640]  They can't stand it when you fund independent pro-America, pro-human media.
[05:53.640 --> 06:10.760]  That's why you've got to take advantage of this shirt and get it today, infowars.com.
[06:10.760 --> 06:24.600]  As we speak, on this Wednesday, December 18, 2019, just week before Christmas, the Democratic
[06:24.600 --> 06:35.200]  Party just voted to officially begin the impeachment process in the House and vote later today
[06:35.200 --> 06:42.120]  to send the indictment to the Senate.
[06:42.120 --> 06:51.440]  And they've got a lot of evil garbage and skullduggery up their sleeves.
[06:51.440 --> 07:04.880]  Let's go back to the clerk of the House reading the charge against the President, the charges
[07:04.880 --> 07:07.520]  of obstructing Congress and abuse of power.
[07:07.520 --> 07:12.160]  And then they will vote as a grand jury on the indictment.
[07:12.160 --> 07:14.160]  They will pass it this afternoon, I believe.
[07:14.160 --> 07:15.160]  They have the votes.
[07:15.160 --> 07:16.160]  They say they do.
[07:16.160 --> 07:17.960]  And it will go to the Senate.
[07:17.960 --> 07:23.320]  Into his own conduct, as well as the unilateral prerogative to deny any and all information
[07:23.320 --> 07:28.800]  to the House of Representatives and the exercise of its sole power of impeachment.
[07:28.800 --> 07:32.800]  In the history of the Republic, no president has ever ordered the complete defiance of
[07:32.800 --> 07:37.800]  an impeachment inquiry or sought to obstruct and impede so comfortably the possibility of
[07:37.800 --> 07:42.760]  the House of Representatives to investigate high crimes and all of this is lies.
[07:42.760 --> 07:46.040]  This abuse of office served to cover up the president's own repeated misdemeanor.
[07:46.040 --> 07:49.840]  When they were having kangaroo's secret intelligence committee hearings in the basement that no
[07:49.840 --> 07:54.480]  one could be part of, Trump said, well, we're not part of this.
[07:54.480 --> 07:56.040]  We're not even invited.
[07:56.040 --> 08:00.800]  In all of this, that's obstructing Congress in a manner contrary to his trust as president.
[08:00.800 --> 08:03.800]  You walk into an Australian court, you know, if there's no humans, there's kangaroos.
[08:03.800 --> 08:08.840]  There's prejudice of the cause of law and justice into the manifest injury of the people
[08:08.840 --> 08:14.240]  of the United States, wherefore, President Trump, by such conduct, has demonstrated
[08:14.240 --> 08:18.840]  that he will remain a threat to the Constitution if allowed to remain in office and has acted
[08:18.840 --> 08:24.520]  in a manner grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law.
[08:24.520 --> 08:25.520]  President Trump thus warns impeachment.
[08:25.520 --> 08:28.960]  And again, they're trying to overthrow the Bill of Rights and Constitution or overthrow
[08:28.960 --> 08:35.960]  our election and stop him getting reelected next year.
[08:35.960 --> 08:36.960]  He's done.
[08:36.960 --> 08:37.960]  That's 320 days out.
[08:37.960 --> 08:44.280]  Pursuant to House Resolution 767, the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended
[08:44.280 --> 08:46.800]  by the Committee on Judiciary is adopted.
[08:46.800 --> 08:52.320]  The resolution shall be debatable for six hours, equally divided, and controlled by the Chair
[08:52.320 --> 08:57.280]  and Ranking Member of the Committee on the Judiciary or their respective designees.
[08:57.280 --> 09:02.080]  The gentleman from New York, Mr. Nadler, and the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Collins, each
[09:02.080 --> 09:03.760]  will control three hours.
[09:03.760 --> 09:07.280]  The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from New York, Mr. Nadler.
[09:07.280 --> 09:12.840]  Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all members may have five legislative days
[09:12.840 --> 09:18.280]  in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on H. Res.
[09:18.280 --> 09:19.280]  755.
[09:19.280 --> 09:20.520]  Without objection, so ordered.
[09:20.520 --> 09:25.640]  Mr. Speaker, I now yield one minute to the distinguished Speaker of the House.
[09:25.640 --> 09:30.640]  Madam Lady, distinguished Speaker is recognized for one minute.
[09:30.640 --> 09:36.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, I thank the gentleman for yielding for his leadership and helping
[09:36.840 --> 09:39.480]  us honor the Constitution of the United States.
[09:39.480 --> 09:45.640]  I also extend my gratitude to Chairman Schiff, who will be residing later.
[09:45.640 --> 09:48.240]  She loves America.
[09:48.240 --> 09:53.320]  My colleagues, this morning and every morning, when we come together, this is all about us
[09:53.320 --> 09:58.520]  trying to get our government back, and the government's been hijacked, and the globalists
[09:58.520 --> 10:02.200]  are the ones trying to destroy the country, telling us, our president, it's totally for
[10:02.200 --> 10:03.200]  the country.
[10:03.200 --> 10:08.840]  He may make mistakes, but damn it, he is the president, and he cares about the country.
[10:08.840 --> 10:12.280]  He's trying to get control of our country back from these scumbags, and then they're
[10:12.280 --> 10:16.560]  up there saying that he's against America, and then we're against it.
[10:16.560 --> 10:18.840]  You're a damn lying witch, Pelosi.
[10:18.840 --> 10:22.360]  Damn you to hell.
[10:22.360 --> 10:30.600]  To the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice
[10:30.600 --> 10:31.600]  for all.
[10:31.600 --> 10:32.920]  Now she's pledging allegiance.
[10:32.920 --> 10:36.320]  For which it stands is what we are here to talk about.
[10:36.320 --> 10:38.120]  America's not buying this.
[10:38.120 --> 10:39.120]  A republic.
[10:39.120 --> 10:40.120]  This is a sham.
[10:40.120 --> 10:41.120]  We can keep it.
[10:41.120 --> 10:44.920]  We gather today under the dome of this temple of democracy.
[10:44.920 --> 10:47.120]  It's a republic if you can keep it.
[10:47.120 --> 10:49.480]  They're the ones getting rid of the country.
[10:49.480 --> 10:52.160]  The impeachment of the president of the United States.
[10:52.160 --> 10:53.160]  No borders.
[10:53.160 --> 10:54.160]  No walls.
[10:54.160 --> 10:56.160]  No USA at all.
[10:56.160 --> 10:57.160]  Come to Congress.
[10:57.160 --> 11:01.000]  MS-13 are God's children.
[11:01.000 --> 11:02.000]  America was never great.
[11:02.000 --> 11:03.000]  Never be that great.
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.600]  Let's do it on this historic house floor before our beautiful American flag and raised our
[11:08.600 --> 11:10.920]  hands in this sacred oath.
[11:10.920 --> 11:15.720]  Three-quarters of Americans say they hate Nancy Pelosi, even in their skewed polls.
[11:15.720 --> 11:17.400]  That's not a new poll.
[11:17.400 --> 11:18.400]  Against all enemies.
[11:18.400 --> 11:21.320]  Polls a year ago.
[11:21.320 --> 11:23.120]  So help me, God.
[11:23.120 --> 11:30.320]  For 230 years, members have taken that sacred oath, which makes us custodians of the country.
[11:30.320 --> 11:31.800]  By the way, they're taking God out of everything.
[11:31.800 --> 11:32.800]  They're attacking Christmas.
[11:32.800 --> 11:33.880]  It's all over the news.
[11:33.880 --> 11:36.840]  The left attacked the Supreme Court justice for saying Merry Christmas.
[11:36.840 --> 11:39.400]  They said, look at how he used that hate word.
[11:39.400 --> 11:40.760]  Now they want to ban that word.
[11:40.760 --> 11:43.040]  That's mainstream news today.
[11:43.040 --> 11:46.360]  Starting with the sacred words, we the people.
[11:46.360 --> 11:53.600]  Can't people just attack the big nativity scene in Europe for the people?
[11:53.600 --> 11:59.160]  Very sadly now, our founder's vision of a republic is under threat from actions from the White
[11:59.160 --> 12:00.160]  House.
[12:00.160 --> 12:01.680]  Oh, the republic is under threat from Trump.
[12:01.680 --> 12:02.680]  Oh.
[12:02.680 --> 12:08.360]  The House, I solemnly and sadly open the debate on the impeachment of the President of the
[12:08.360 --> 12:09.360]  United States.
[12:09.360 --> 12:14.680]  And again, if you're a radio listener, she has a big American flag, host her up, and it
[12:14.680 --> 12:18.840]  says to the republic for which it stands, when everything they're doing is about destroying
[12:18.840 --> 12:19.840]  the republic.
[12:19.840 --> 12:21.720]  No choice.
[12:21.720 --> 12:27.920]  What we are discussing today is the established fact that the president violated the Constitution.
[12:27.920 --> 12:34.400]  It is a matter of fact that the president is an ongoing threat to our national security
[12:34.400 --> 12:36.720]  and the integrity of our elections.
[12:36.720 --> 12:39.960]  What did Senator Blumenthal and all the rest of them say?
[12:39.960 --> 12:44.640]  He said, for America to survive, Alex Jones must be taken off the air.
[12:44.640 --> 12:46.360]  Senator Wyden said the same thing.
[12:46.360 --> 12:48.440]  Senator Murphy said the same thing.
[12:48.440 --> 12:51.160]  I must be taken off the state of America.
[12:51.160 --> 12:52.160]  Yeah, right.
[12:52.160 --> 12:53.560]  That was sad one.
[12:53.560 --> 12:58.480]  I submit these documents for the record and commend them for students to study.
[12:58.480 --> 13:03.480]  The state of America, Trump must be removed.
[13:03.480 --> 13:09.080]  What we are discussing today is the established fact that the president, again, violated the
[13:09.080 --> 13:10.080]  Constitution.
[13:10.080 --> 13:11.640]  By the way, okay, that's enough for now.
[13:11.640 --> 13:12.640]  We'll come back to more of it.
[13:12.640 --> 13:15.560]  And the Republican response is a little out of this today throughout the next three or
[13:15.560 --> 13:19.720]  four hours while these debates are happening.
[13:19.720 --> 13:24.040]  But you're seeing history unfold right now.
[13:24.040 --> 13:27.080]  So they've had a lot of talking points.
[13:27.080 --> 13:30.640]  Quid pro quo, that it's no one's above the law.
[13:30.640 --> 13:39.240]  Now it's established fact, established fact, established fact that he worked against American
[13:39.240 --> 13:42.960]  interest and that he obstructed Congress and that he abused his power.
[13:42.960 --> 13:46.600]  Established fact, established fact, Polly wanna cracker, Polly wanna cracker, Polly
[13:46.600 --> 13:47.600]  wanna cracker.
[13:47.600 --> 13:53.440]  You're gonna hear that so many times it's gonna make you want to jump off a cliff.
[13:53.440 --> 13:56.320]  There's so much other insane news.
[13:56.320 --> 14:03.880]  I mean, the left is saying arrest people that say Eskimo, fire people that say nerd or geek.
[14:03.880 --> 14:06.040]  I mean, and they're doing it.
[14:06.040 --> 14:10.240]  It's a rain of terror by these people, and they're trying to shut us down because they
[14:10.240 --> 14:16.040]  know Info Wars is the tip of the spear, but listen, folks, here's the exciting thing.
[14:16.040 --> 14:19.200]  You are spreading the word and people are looking for the truth more than ever.
[14:19.200 --> 14:27.520]  So they have turned Info Wars into what it's always really been, the voice of America,
[14:27.520 --> 14:32.520]  a Paul Revere outfit raising the alarm and they've really let people know, hey, I'm not
[14:32.520 --> 14:33.520]  supposed to listen to that.
[14:33.520 --> 14:38.640]  So in ways, Info Wars is more influential than ever, but we don't reach new people without
[14:38.640 --> 14:41.880]  you spreading the word and we don't get to reach those people and keep our operations
[14:41.880 --> 14:46.120]  going without you buying products and listen.
[14:46.120 --> 14:48.240]  Now is the time of your Christmas shopping at infowarstore.com.
[14:48.240 --> 14:50.640]  I know a lot of you probably procrastinated.
[14:50.640 --> 14:54.240]  Well, no need to go fight the big lines or the traffic.
[14:54.240 --> 14:58.680]  Go to infowarstore.com and here's a shot for TV viewers.
[14:58.680 --> 15:04.320]  This is from UPS and it's similar with USPS.
[15:04.320 --> 15:10.400]  This is everywhere in the US as of this morning, one day delivery, basically half the United
[15:10.400 --> 15:19.080]  States, two day delivery, almost all the other areas, three day delivery to Alaska and Hawaii.
[15:19.080 --> 15:21.640]  You order today, you get it in three days.
[15:21.640 --> 15:25.480]  You order by Friday, you get it well before Christmas.
[15:25.480 --> 15:29.760]  Go to infowarstore.com and you can deliver it to whoever you want as gifts and in the
[15:29.760 --> 15:34.040]  comment section when you check out, just write them a letter, write them a note, or send
[15:34.040 --> 15:41.040]  them an email and say, hey, a package is coming and it's got five to 15 bumper stickers in
[15:41.040 --> 15:43.120]  each order depending on how big it is.
[15:43.120 --> 15:47.560]  Got some little booklets and things and it's all the great products, books, films, water,
[15:47.560 --> 15:52.880]  filter, air filtration, the best systems, non-GMO, heirloom seeds, the great supplements.
[15:52.880 --> 15:57.880]  Here's somebody, some brain force, some turbo force, some protein bars, we've got the seven.
[15:57.880 --> 15:59.360]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[15:59.360 --> 16:03.280]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:03.280 --> 16:04.840]  I sued the IRS in one.
[16:04.840 --> 16:07.800]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:07.800 --> 16:11.080]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[16:11.080 --> 16:13.320]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[16:13.320 --> 16:14.640]  I can help you too.
[16:14.640 --> 16:17.640]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[16:17.640 --> 16:19.880]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[16:19.880 --> 16:27.840]  Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[16:27.840 --> 16:31.520]  I'm here with Scott Yousseam, founder of OMG Tax.
[16:31.520 --> 16:36.280]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[16:36.280 --> 16:41.640]  My team of lawyers enrolled agents and licensed tax experts removed wage garnish funds, sometimes
[16:41.640 --> 16:42.720]  in the same day.
[16:42.720 --> 16:46.240]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what
[16:46.240 --> 16:48.200]  is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:48.200 --> 16:50.440]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[16:50.440 --> 16:52.040]  Oh, can I ever?
[16:52.040 --> 16:57.280]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[16:57.280 --> 16:58.280]  Guess what?
[16:58.280 --> 17:02.960]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[17:02.960 --> 17:08.120]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot
[17:08.120 --> 17:13.600]  less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax saving consultation.
[17:13.600 --> 17:27.280]  Call 800-486-8112-800-486-8112-800-486-8112, that's 800-486-8112.

[18:24.000 --> 18:35.600]  The globalists have sent in the clowns, they've sent in antifa, they've broken our borders
[18:35.600 --> 18:39.400]  with some of the most hardened criminals from around the world, they've tried to poison
[18:39.400 --> 18:44.280]  us with fluoride and GMO and the tainted vaccines, they've sent in their clowns.
[18:44.280 --> 18:49.840]  But now the men and women of America are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere
[18:49.840 --> 18:54.440]  and I'm so proud of Infowars leading the charge, but the only way we can do that is when you
[18:54.440 --> 18:57.720]  keep spreading the word about our broadcast and when you keep buying the great products
[18:57.720 --> 18:59.200]  at InfowarsTour.com.
[18:59.200 --> 19:02.120]  The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased but I'm going to tell you all now, if you
[19:02.120 --> 19:04.360]  haven't tried Turboforce you need to try it.
[19:04.360 --> 19:09.040]  I've tried Turboforce with everything, sometimes you know I went a little bit crazy, I put
[19:09.040 --> 19:13.400]  Turboforce in my coffee, that was a crazy week, I don't remember sleeping but as far
[19:13.400 --> 19:17.240]  as the products go Turboforce is my favorite and all the Infowars products are down to
[19:17.240 --> 19:21.120]  taking control of your life, taking control of your health, not relying on other people
[19:21.120 --> 19:23.400]  to do it for you.
[19:23.400 --> 19:27.840]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better
[19:27.840 --> 19:28.840]  life.
[19:28.840 --> 19:31.560]  I'm going to wake up today, you know what, I'm going to spend my entire day trying to
[19:31.560 --> 19:34.760]  make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer, I'm going to make sure he gets
[19:34.760 --> 19:35.760]  a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[19:35.760 --> 19:39.080]  I don't think that happens very often, it's never happened to me, I've never had anyone
[19:39.080 --> 19:42.440]  knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy, how can I improve your life in
[19:42.440 --> 19:43.440]  every single way?
[19:43.440 --> 19:45.920]  There's only one person who woke up and fought that and that was me.
[19:45.920 --> 19:49.200]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life, I want
[19:49.200 --> 19:52.000]  to take control of my health and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com, take control
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.520]  of your health right now and support the resistance, don't buy into the group, think, don't drink
[19:55.520 --> 20:02.680]  the Kool-Aid, drink the Turboforce, Kool-Aid's bad and the Turboforce is good.
[20:02.680 --> 20:20.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:20.120 --> 20:34.800]  The House of Representatives, controlled by Democrats, publicly committed to destruction,
[20:34.800 --> 20:43.800]  the very existence of the United States of America, have just initiated debate on the
[20:43.800 --> 21:09.920]  issue of humanity, with만 the Kool-Aid.
[21:09.920 --> 21:14.520]  right now, Madam Speaker, we on the Republican side have no problem taking our case to the
[21:14.520 --> 21:18.120]  majority and to the people of this country because they elected Donald Trump. And it
[21:18.120 --> 21:24.200]  is a matter for the voters, not this house, not in this way, not in the way this is being
[21:24.200 --> 21:29.960]  done. It has trampled everything this house believes in. I said it yesterday and I believe
[21:29.960 --> 21:35.320]  it to be this true today. I will fight this on process which has been deplorable to use
[21:35.320 --> 21:40.280]  the word of the majority. It has been awful. The calendar and the clock make it impressive
[21:40.280 --> 21:44.000]  that we actually do it quickly. We don't care about rules. We don't care about minority
[21:44.000 --> 21:47.920]  hearing days. We don't care about giving the opportunity for witnesses to be called because
[21:47.920 --> 21:53.400]  the chairman gets to determine what is relevant. Wow, that's pretty good. Let the accuser determine
[21:53.400 --> 21:58.640]  what is relevant to the one being accused. The people of America see through this. The
[21:58.640 --> 22:03.000]  people of America understand due process and they understand when it is being trampled
[22:03.000 --> 22:07.360]  in the people's house. You see, it's also not a matter of process which will be discussed.
[22:07.360 --> 22:12.120]  It's a matter of actual facts. I will fight the facts all day long because what we found
[22:12.120 --> 22:15.840]  here today is a president who did not do as being charged. In fact, they had to go to
[22:15.840 --> 22:20.360]  abuse of power. This amorphous term that you're going to hear many, many arguments about how
[22:20.360 --> 22:27.880]  that abuse of power, except for one thing, the call itself, the two parties say no pressure.
[22:27.880 --> 22:31.040]  Nothing was ever done to get the money. In fact, they didn't even know the money was
[22:31.040 --> 22:37.040]  held. But there is something that very much bothers me about the facts. There were five
[22:37.040 --> 22:42.760]  meetings. We'll hear about those today in which it was never a linkage made. There was one
[22:42.760 --> 22:48.000]  witness that is depended on over 600 times in the majority's report that in the end after
[22:48.000 --> 22:53.440]  questioned had to say, well, that was my presumption of what was happening. You see, this is an
[22:53.440 --> 22:57.440]  impeachment based on presumption. This is an impeachment, basically also a poll tested
[22:57.440 --> 23:01.440]  impeachment on what actually sells to the American people. Today's going to be a lot
[23:01.440 --> 23:08.360]  of things. What it is not is fair. What it is not is about the truth. What is true today,
[23:08.360 --> 23:12.000]  and I just heard it just a moment ago in the articles themselves where it said in the, in
[23:12.000 --> 23:18.200]  the speaker, I believe, actually talked about this as well, is that the president weakened
[23:18.200 --> 23:22.760]  a foreign leader. You know what the truth of the matter is? I speak of the most interesting
[23:22.760 --> 23:26.960]  and deplorable thing that I've heard over the last few weeks is the actual attack by
[23:26.960 --> 23:31.200]  the majority on president Zelensky, because they realized their whole crux of their case
[23:31.200 --> 23:35.480]  is, is that if he was not pressured, their house of cards falls. And by the way, it's
[23:35.480 --> 23:40.680]  already failed. But if we can't pressure show pressure, then we either have to call him
[23:40.680 --> 23:46.600]  a liar, a world leader, or we have to make up names to call him. And that's exactly what
[23:46.600 --> 23:49.920]  happened in the judiciary committee. When a member of the majority actually said he's
[23:49.920 --> 23:54.880]  acting or they're complaining to a battered wife, that is below the dignity of this body
[23:54.880 --> 23:59.600]  to take a world leader. And when he doesn't make your case for you to belittle him, especially
[23:59.600 --> 24:04.000]  as is going to be often said by the majority that they're in the middle of a hot war with
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.360]  Russia. You see, President Trump actually did give them offensive weapons. President
[24:08.360 --> 24:11.680]  Trump did nothing wrong. We're going to talk about that all day long today. We went on
[24:11.680 --> 24:15.640]  process and we went on facts. Why? Because the American people will see through this.
[24:15.640 --> 24:20.800]  But before I close this first part, I will have to recognize that even the Senate, the
[24:20.800 --> 24:25.320]  minority leader in the Senate recognizes that the House did not do their job because he
[24:25.320 --> 24:28.840]  can't make the case to his own members. So he's having to ask for witnesses, ask for
[24:28.840 --> 24:32.880]  more time. You see, and even yesterday, it was sort of funny. I thought it hilarious
[24:32.880 --> 24:36.800]  that the minority leader in the Senate went out and did a press conference and said, they
[24:36.800 --> 24:41.800]  denied my witnesses. They denied my request. Well, welcome to the club, Mr. Schumer. That's
[24:41.800 --> 24:47.880]  exactly what's happened over here for the last three months. So today we're going to
[24:47.880 --> 24:51.080]  talk a lot about impeachment. We're going to talk a lot about a president and we're
[24:51.080 --> 24:55.560]  going to talk about two articles of impeachment. Abuse of power because they can't actually
[24:55.560 --> 25:01.720]  pin anything a factual basis on him. The president did nothing wrong in this issue.
[25:01.720 --> 25:05.160]  And then they're going to talk about obstruction of Congress. You know, obstruction of Congress,
[25:05.160 --> 25:08.200]  as I've said before, is like petulant children saying we didn't get our way when we didn't
[25:08.200 --> 25:11.720]  ask the right way and we didn't actually go after it and try to make a case. You know,
[25:11.720 --> 25:18.040]  my, Madam Speaker, the clock and the calendar are terrible masters and the majority will
[25:18.040 --> 25:22.280]  own that problem today because to the clock and the calendar facts don't.
[25:22.280 --> 25:29.080]  All right. This is live coverage of the historic impeachment of President Trump. You know, they're
[25:29.080 --> 25:33.800]  going to pass it this afternoon. They already have the votes. We're going to be going back
[25:33.800 --> 25:38.120]  and forth showing mainly what the Republicans have to say, because the Democrats just repeat
[25:38.120 --> 25:41.080]  the same garbage over and over again, but we'll show some of what the Democrats have
[25:41.080 --> 25:45.560]  to say. What we're really going to do is take your phone calls because they want
[25:45.560 --> 25:51.160]  outfits like this silence because they don't want you having a voice. Well, you have a voice
[25:51.160 --> 25:55.720]  and it's a voice you amplify when you spread the word about it and when you pray for it,
[25:55.720 --> 26:02.040]  when you support it. I want to take your calls on this historic event and where you think it's
[26:02.040 --> 26:06.840]  going and what they're going to pull in the Senate. Did you just hear them? It's true.
[26:06.840 --> 26:10.760]  Now they want more time in the Senate
[26:13.080 --> 26:18.040]  because they don't want to pull back impeachment, but they want to drag it out longer hoping
[26:18.040 --> 26:22.600]  something pops up. Well, they know what they're going to pop up. More allegations against the
[26:22.600 --> 26:30.120]  president that won't be inside the Senate trial, but will they believe add weight to that he's
[26:30.120 --> 26:38.280]  a villain? Get ready. We're not out of the woods yet. The toll free number to join us is 877-789
[26:38.280 --> 26:47.000]  Alex, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539 on impeachment. We're taking your phone calls on this Wednesday
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.240]  edition. Now, I want to show TV viewers this map and I want to talk about it for radio listeners.
[26:53.240 --> 27:01.640]  This is a map that shows what's happening with UPS, very similar to USPS, and most of the country is
[27:01.640 --> 27:06.360]  one day delivery, as you can see. Some parts of the country, two-day delivery, but all the country
[27:06.360 --> 27:13.720]  from Alaska to the great state of Hawaii is three-day. That's today. So that means you order
[27:13.720 --> 27:18.440]  today, you get it Saturday in Hawaii. If you order by Friday, you'll still get it before

[29:39.800 --> 30:05.800]  We're closing out the year 2019. I don't have to tell you that 2020 is going to be
[30:05.800 --> 30:10.920]  maker to break it. Not just for M4 Wars, not just for America, but the whole world. We are in a
[30:10.920 --> 30:15.560]  battle between the forces of globalism that want to post human world and those that want to pro-human
[30:15.560 --> 30:21.560]  world. We're in a fight between Satan and Christ, and it's being played out amongst us mortals,
[30:21.560 --> 30:26.040]  but it's being directed from on high. And I'm just telling the listeners this broadcast,
[30:26.760 --> 30:32.680]  without you, we're going to lose this fight. I need all of you to realize how important you are
[30:32.680 --> 30:38.120]  and how important M4 Wars is and what we've done together. And to just take stock and take measure
[30:38.120 --> 30:42.440]  here at the end of the year and think about what you're going to do, whether supporting M4 Wars

[33:15.240 --> 33:27.720]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[33:33.560 --> 33:40.680]  History is happening. Yes, impeachment is backfiring. They've got tricks up their sleeves.
[33:40.680 --> 33:46.840]  The Democrats want to extend the Senate trial. My gut told me they would do that. I said that
[33:46.840 --> 33:51.560]  weeks ago Trump wants to extend it so he has time to have his witnesses and expose them.
[33:54.280 --> 33:57.560]  But you see they're going to sneak attack with more women saying they got raped.
[33:58.600 --> 34:03.000]  They're going to sneak attack with claiming inwards were said. None of it's going to be true.
[34:03.000 --> 34:09.640]  I've experienced the same stuff. They have a playbook. And just watch.
[34:11.400 --> 34:15.080]  At first they wanted to have it done by Christmas now. I think it's going to probably go on past
[34:15.080 --> 34:19.640]  Christmas, maybe even to the new year. What is your take on it? I really respect it.
[34:20.200 --> 34:24.200]  Don't just say that. I'm always blown away by angles that listeners come up with that
[34:24.200 --> 34:30.040]  helped me get a better picture. We're having a big open boardroom discussion here together.
[34:30.040 --> 34:37.000]  We're going to go to your phone calls 877-789-2539. You've got live coverage going,
[34:37.000 --> 34:40.920]  but just during the break I was watching Congressman Sensenbrenner. He was making
[34:40.920 --> 34:47.640]  some good points. Here he is. Other high crimes and misdemeanors. Unlike the Nixon and Clinton
[34:47.640 --> 34:55.080]  cases, there are no allegations that the president has committed a crime. We've had almost three years
[34:55.080 --> 35:01.320]  of nonstop investigations. We've had the Mueller report. We've had the Schiff investigation.
[35:01.320 --> 35:07.880]  We've had the Nadler investigation. And at no time is there any evidence that indicates that
[35:07.880 --> 35:15.160]  Donald J. Trump violated any criminal statute of the United States. So why are we here?
[35:16.040 --> 35:23.400]  We're here because the majority caucus, the Democratic caucus, has been hijacked by the
[35:23.400 --> 35:30.680]  radical left. They have wanted to reverse the course of the 2016 election ever since Donald
[35:30.680 --> 35:36.440]  J. Trump won that election. So let's look at these two phony articles of impeachment.
[35:37.480 --> 35:43.720]  First of all, abuse of power. The phone call and question had the president say,
[35:44.600 --> 35:52.600]  our country has been through a lot. I want you to do us a favor, not me a favor,
[35:52.600 --> 35:59.000]  us a favor. And there he was referring to our country, the United States of America,
[35:59.560 --> 36:08.200]  not a personal political game. He was not afraid to let this transcript go public.
[36:08.200 --> 36:14.600]  And he released the transcript almost immediately after the call. Now, the second article of
[36:14.600 --> 36:21.400]  impeachment obstruction of Congress, it basically says that unless the president gives us everything
[36:21.400 --> 36:28.360]  we want and when we want it, then he's committed an impeachable offense. That's a bunch of bunk.
[36:29.080 --> 36:34.440]  The president has certain individual privileges by virtue of his office.
[36:35.240 --> 36:39.880]  Whenever there's been a dispute between the executive and legislative branches here and
[36:39.880 --> 36:45.960]  before, they've gone to court. And the Supreme Court, a couple weeks ago, said they would
[36:45.960 --> 36:52.040]  take jurisdiction over deciding whether the president had to comply with one subpoena relating
[36:52.040 --> 37:00.760]  to his tax returns. Now, here the Democrats have been bent to impeach the president of the United
[37:00.760 --> 37:09.480]  States before the court decides this. And this means that there is a rushed job to do this.
[37:09.480 --> 37:17.400]  And why is there? Because they want to influence the 2020 elections. And they spent three years
[37:17.400 --> 37:23.400]  doing it. They spent millions of taxpayers' dollars, including the Mueller report, putting
[37:23.400 --> 37:31.720]  together this impeachment. And they also have had this Congress wrapped around an impeachment
[37:31.720 --> 37:35.000]  and not doing their jobs until the dam broke this week.
[37:35.000 --> 37:39.240]  Stop this charade, vote no, and I yield back.
[37:41.880 --> 37:43.720]  Good to see you back, gentlemen, from New York.
[37:43.720 --> 37:48.120]  All right, that was just minutes ago. We've got live coverage of it, but I wanted you to hear what
[37:49.000 --> 37:54.680]  Sensenbrenner said because it was absolutely on target, 100% true. Now, I know the audience knows
[37:54.680 --> 38:02.360]  that, but we've got to look beneath the surface here. Remember, three months ago, everybody said,
[38:02.360 --> 38:07.400]  Alex, you're wrong. They're never going to bring forward impeachment on the stupid Ukraine thing.
[38:07.400 --> 38:12.680]  Nobody will buy that. It's going to be unpopular because their own focus groups showed that,
[38:13.400 --> 38:16.840]  especially going into an election here. And they've already lied about Trump and been
[38:16.840 --> 38:22.680]  caught so many times that anybody with half a brain knew this was not a good idea.
[38:24.520 --> 38:27.720]  So why are they doing it? Because what Sensenbrenner just said,
[38:27.720 --> 38:33.560]  the radical Marxist and Leninist left that literally hates America,
[38:34.760 --> 38:40.040]  that's funded by the big foundations that are tax-exempt offshore robber barons who want to
[38:40.040 --> 38:46.520]  break up nation-states and make us dysfunctional, it's all admitted by them, have financed this
[38:46.520 --> 38:52.280]  through colleges. I've got stacks of articles today and from yesterday, I didn't get to,
[38:52.280 --> 39:02.200]  where colleges are kicking people out if they're in class and they teach whites are inherently
[39:02.200 --> 39:06.040]  evil. If you get up and say, that's racist, you're kicked out.
[39:11.400 --> 39:18.520]  People are now offended by regular scientific words. Two men were fired from a state-funded
[39:18.520 --> 39:31.480]  project in Canada. We're simply pointing out, oh, there comes some Eskimos. That's what they're
[39:31.480 --> 39:39.240]  called. But the name Eskimo, people were offended because two white men who'd worked there for
[39:39.240 --> 39:50.280]  decades, who were doing construction work, talked about Eskimo in a private conversation.
[39:51.240 --> 39:55.320]  That's why they don't call it the Chinese New Year. The left said 20 years ago, oh,
[39:55.320 --> 40:01.000]  saying Chinese New Year hurts Chinese. They invented the calendar for the Chinese New Year.
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.560]  It's called the Chinese New Year, like the Gregorian calendar.
[40:05.560 --> 40:08.840]  It comes from what, the Romans?
[40:16.040 --> 40:19.560]  You know, the Ten Commandments is Jewish. It doesn't hurt Jews to say that.
[40:20.600 --> 40:26.200]  They're just making language and normal words offensive so that the people are scared of knowledge.
[40:28.360 --> 40:34.040]  And so these colleges are so dangerous now and now it's permeating out into the
[40:34.040 --> 40:42.840]  compliance officers and the human resources departments and sensitivity training that is to
[40:42.840 --> 40:48.680]  create ships on the shoulders where America and the West cannot even operate.
[40:51.400 --> 40:57.480]  Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorshich just appeared on Fox and Friends this morning making a point
[40:57.480 --> 41:06.280]  to parrot the Merry Christmas talking point of the GOP. Is he willing to go on Fox and throw a
[41:06.280 --> 41:10.920]  shout-out to Republican narratives? If he is able to, what else is he willing to do?
[41:12.040 --> 41:15.960]  Now that's not a Twilight Zone joke like in the year 2019.
[41:16.840 --> 41:23.320]  Writers for Playboy would go on a thing called Twitter and say that saying the word Christmas is evil.
[41:23.320 --> 41:33.400]  In Canada, in Australia, in England, in Texas, I see articles all the time where little kids
[41:33.400 --> 41:38.760]  hand out Christmas cards and the school admonishes them and says separation of church and state.
[41:40.280 --> 41:43.480]  Separation of church and state is you don't have the government saying one religion.
[41:43.480 --> 41:49.000]  A child can hand out Harry Potter cards or they can hand out Christian cards,
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.360]  but it's only Christians they're blocking. England's banning Christmas cards and schools saying it
[41:54.360 --> 42:00.760]  hurts the earth, but all other papers okay. There is a war on the word mother and father.
[42:00.760 --> 42:07.080]  There is a war on Christ in Christmas. They would always try to deny that. Now they admit that
[42:07.080 --> 42:15.080]  this is a cult beyond anything we've ever seen. In China and in Russia, under the Soviet Union,
[42:15.080 --> 42:20.040]  they made it the winter festival and tried to bring Christmas out of it and used Santa Claus
[42:20.040 --> 42:27.000]  and pushed him in there as well. Santa Claus wasn't popular till the 30s when Coca-Cola popularized
[42:27.000 --> 42:37.560]  the guy in a red suit with the black boots and the big belly, but now they even want that gone
[42:37.560 --> 42:43.560]  because it has some connection to Christ. Oh, and Santa Claus is white. We'll come back to your phone
[42:43.560 --> 42:49.160]  calls. Cover all of this. It just shows what a dangerous cult they're a revolutionary group.
[42:49.160 --> 42:53.080]  This is just a warm-up for them. It's about dividing the country even if they fail
[42:53.080 --> 42:56.200]  and they're going to pull some big tricks during the Senate trial.
[42:58.200 --> 43:05.640]  It's your last chance to get the original designer limited edition Jeffrey Epstein Christmas
[43:05.640 --> 43:10.840]  sweater. The globalists are so scared of this story continuing to come out for people learning
[43:10.840 --> 43:17.160]  about the deep state and the international blackmail rings using kidnapped women and children
[43:17.160 --> 43:24.200]  to compromise world leaders. They do not want this story continuing. And this is your last chance
[43:24.200 --> 43:29.720]  to get the limited edition Christmas sweater at infowarstore.com to help spread the word,
[43:29.720 --> 43:34.600]  to have a piece of history, and to fund our operation. So again, it says Christmas lights
[43:34.600 --> 43:38.760]  are a lot like Epstein, but these things don't hang themselves on the front. On the back,
[43:38.760 --> 43:44.440]  it's got infowars.com and shows the O in info wars has a wreath that's also a noose.
[43:44.440 --> 43:49.160]  The system can't stand it when you promote things the grassroots level. They can't stand it when
[43:49.160 --> 43:54.520]  you fund independent pro-america pro-human media. That's why you've got to take advantage
[43:54.520 --> 43:57.240]  of this shirt and get it today at infowarstore.com.
[44:00.680 --> 44:04.840]  The globalists think America is done. The globalists think the West is done. They think
[44:04.840 --> 44:10.280]  that Christians are done and finished. They believe they've broken our backs. They believe that with
[44:10.280 --> 44:15.800]  big tech censorship will just crawl into dishes and submit to them. And they believe that if they can
[44:15.800 --> 44:21.240]  demonize and shut down info wars that they rightfully see as a symbol of beacon of populism
[44:21.240 --> 44:25.640]  and freedom, not just to America, but to the whole world, that they can demoralize everybody else and
[44:25.640 --> 44:30.600]  win. While they can shut info wars down, they can intimidate everybody else. That's why it's beyond
[44:30.600 --> 44:35.080]  critical that you keep info wars on the air. It's only by your word of mouth, your prayer,
[44:35.080 --> 44:39.000]  your financial support that we're on air. And I want to thank you all this Christmas for your
[44:39.000 --> 44:44.120]  past support. But I want to encourage you now to redouble your efforts and financially support us
[44:44.120 --> 44:48.520]  by getting great products you need. You're going to 12 days of Christmas at infowarstore.com.
[44:48.520 --> 44:55.320]  Massive sales, store-wide free shipping, double patria points, infowarstore.com. Please take
[44:55.320 --> 45:01.800]  action now towards Soros hopes you don't. So what's the most important part? Let's say in a bulldozer
[45:01.800 --> 45:06.920]  running over the globalist, the treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front. It's all very
[45:06.920 --> 45:13.080]  important, but the fuel is paramount. And that's my allegor. Turbo force is vitamins, minerals,
[45:13.080 --> 45:18.200]  amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy
[45:18.200 --> 45:22.920]  that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human. Some people get 15
[45:22.920 --> 45:25.960]  hours out of this. Some people get about eight hours, but people take this, people take it in
[45:25.960 --> 45:30.920]  sports. People cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not high. Nobody puts as
[45:30.920 --> 45:36.040]  much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts. You can call us whatever you want.
[45:36.040 --> 45:41.720]  It's a total solution all around the best you're going to find. Turbo force, without you, we don't
[45:41.720 --> 45:46.280]  roll. With you, we search forward together. It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel. If we
[45:46.280 --> 45:49.960]  don't have your financial support, we will be defeated. You support us to get products you
[45:49.960 --> 45:54.120]  already need that literally fuel your body and your mind. It's a win-win, 360 together,
[45:54.120 --> 46:01.720]  infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139. It's time to take yourself to the next level. It doesn't
[46:01.720 --> 46:05.800]  matter if you're a man, doesn't matter if you're a woman, doesn't matter if you're old or young.
[46:05.800 --> 46:13.080]  As you age, preglonone levels in the body go down. Now, in 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you
[46:13.080 --> 46:19.320]  what preglonone does, but look into the fact that they've been prescribing it since the 1920s
[46:19.320 --> 46:25.400]  for people that have arthritis and then it just gets wilder from there. Medical science knows
[46:25.400 --> 46:31.320]  all about this, but they suppress information about preglonone. We've got the best form of
[46:31.320 --> 46:37.720]  preglonone with a bunch of high quality vitamins and minerals in real red pill. Real red pill plus
[46:37.720 --> 46:43.320]  has some added energy as well. Now, you can get it for 65% off with a free bottle of Biotruce
[46:43.320 --> 46:48.760]  selenium that's from the mustard seed. The two go together in an incredible way. The real red pill
[46:48.760 --> 46:55.400]  and real red pill plus 65% off with a free bottle of Biotruce selenium at infowarstore.com
[46:55.400 --> 46:58.600]  through the new year. Change your life, take yourself to the next level.
[46:58.600 --> 47:24.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide.
[47:24.760 --> 47:53.560]  It's Alex Jones here's one of the Democrats from Hawaii
[47:54.760 --> 48:04.520]  to say one that says men just need to shut up. Men are inherently evil themselves. Here she is
[48:04.520 --> 48:08.520]  calling for Trump's impeachment. They've just voted to initiate the impeachment. It'll be passed
[48:08.520 --> 48:13.880]  by this evening for only what the third or fourth time in history. Here it is. But if President
[48:13.880 --> 48:19.480]  Trump truly cared about corruption, then he would have listened to the talking points that were
[48:19.480 --> 48:25.640]  prepared by the National Security Council on anti-corruption. He did not. In fact, on those
[48:25.640 --> 48:32.680]  two calls with President Zelensky, he never mentioned the word corruption. He did not abide
[48:32.680 --> 48:39.720]  by the Department of Defense's recommendation that Ukraine had such a wire corruption benchmarks.
[48:39.720 --> 48:45.320]  And he didn't listen to the unanimous conclusion of all of his top advisors that he must release
[48:45.320 --> 48:50.040]  that aid to Ukraine. He did release the aid in 2017. Let's not listen anymore to this. I mean,
[48:50.040 --> 48:55.560]  can you imagine what America will look like if globalists like this get full control of it?
[48:55.560 --> 49:01.560]  We'll look like every blue city, needles, homeless, feces, mental illness, children being taught by
[49:01.560 --> 49:09.320]  pedophiles, how to get kidnapped and murdered. We're going to take your phone calls on this
[49:09.320 --> 49:16.760]  historic event. We have Ezra Levant of Rebel Media with a lot of big news writing shot down
[49:16.760 --> 49:19.560]  where they're starting at the bottom of the next hour. There's an interview for me for his show.
[49:20.520 --> 49:24.280]  You've got the war room coming up with Owen Shroyer knocking it out of the park.
[49:24.920 --> 49:28.520]  And he'll have live coverage. This debate's going to go on until this evening.
[49:30.440 --> 49:34.200]  They're talking about three hours of debate on both sides. But by the time you've got six hours,
[49:34.200 --> 49:41.400]  I would imagine that they're going to be up to about six o'clock this evening,
[49:42.440 --> 49:49.640]  central, maybe five or six Eastern, maybe seven central. So we'll extend war room coverage tonight
[49:50.600 --> 49:57.880]  right into that fourth, fourth hour, ladies and gentlemen. Now I want to take your calls
[49:57.880 --> 50:02.440]  right through the balance of the show. We'll continue to have snippets of what's happening.
[50:02.440 --> 50:10.360]  Now let's go to some live feeds right now as the Republicans are going to another speaker. Here it is.
[50:13.480 --> 50:16.840]  This time is my pleasure to yield a minute and a half to the gentlewoman from West Virginia,
[50:16.840 --> 50:23.880]  Mr. Ladies, recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition of HR 755.
[50:24.520 --> 50:28.520]  Today is a disappointing day. It is the day my colleagues
[50:28.520 --> 50:33.320]  are in absolute political circus simply because they don't like the man occupying the White House.
[50:33.320 --> 50:37.080]  Many Democrats have been intent on increasing the president since the day he took office.
[50:37.080 --> 50:41.320]  Their actions are clearly motivated by hatred for President Trump. This impeachment vote today
[50:41.320 --> 50:45.480]  is the next step in their long-held plan to remove him from office. The partisan impeachment
[50:45.480 --> 50:49.400]  investigation run by the House Intelligence Committee was unnecessarily held behind closed
[50:49.400 --> 50:55.400]  doors and a room designed. Despite the commitment of many of our colleagues to obstruct the Trump
[50:55.400 --> 51:02.920]  administration's agenda at every turn, our country continues to succeed. In this body,
[51:02.920 --> 51:09.640]  however, we have not been able to deliver on what Americans want and need. We still have not
[51:09.640 --> 51:16.520]  finished securing our border. The opioid epidemic still rages in our communities. Our infrastructure
[51:16.520 --> 51:23.160]  is still in dire need of an overhaul, and we still have not reached a bipartisan resolution
[51:23.160 --> 51:30.280]  on drug pricing. If Congress hadn't spent the last year stuck in a divisive, ugly, partisan
[51:30.280 --> 51:35.640]  impeachment debacle, think of what we could have done. The lives that could have been saved,
[51:35.640 --> 51:40.440]  the communities that could have been improved, the crisis on our southern border ended,
[51:40.440 --> 51:47.400]  and the positive work that we should do for our country. But we didn't, all because of divisive
[51:47.400 --> 51:54.440]  political theatrics. Congress can do better than this, and America deserves better. I yield back
[51:54.440 --> 52:10.600]  my time. I rise in support of the articles of impeachment against Donald J. Trump, the 45th
[52:10.600 --> 52:16.280]  president of the United States. No one runs for Congress to impeach a president, but this president
[52:16.280 --> 52:22.200]  has left us no choice. President Trump abused the enormous powers of his office when he solicited
[52:22.200 --> 52:27.560]  foreign interference for the purpose of helping him in his reelection campaign in 2020. The president
[52:27.560 --> 52:31.720]  betrayed our national security and undermined the security of our elections when he put his own
[52:31.720 --> 52:37.560]  personal political interests ahead of the interests of our country. He tried to cheat to win reelection.
[52:37.560 --> 52:42.200]  And this wasn't an attack on Vice President Biden. This was an attack on our democracy.
[52:42.200 --> 52:46.200]  And if we do not hold the president accountable today, we will no longer live in a democracy.
[52:46.200 --> 52:50.360]  We will live in a dictatorship where any future president will be free to abuse their office in
[52:50.360 --> 52:56.680]  order to get reelected. Ladies and gentlemen, what globalism is, is private interest getting
[52:56.680 --> 53:02.120]  control through the bureaucracies, controlling the politicians and then selling out the people's
[53:02.120 --> 53:08.520]  interest to multinational corporations. That's what they stand for. And the idea that the president
[53:08.520 --> 53:17.320]  is becoming a dictator because the president of another country brought up Joe Biden bragging
[53:18.760 --> 53:23.640]  how he said, you fire that prosecutor investigating my son or I'm going to hold a billion dollars up.
[53:24.280 --> 53:31.960]  I said, you got six hours. And he did what I told him to do.
[53:31.960 --> 53:39.240]  I mean, should I play that clip again? I don't think anybody needs me to play that clip again.
[53:40.040 --> 53:45.080]  But maybe we should because you see Twitter and Facebook and YouTube try to block videos
[53:45.960 --> 53:51.000]  of Joe Biden and of Trump ads showing that and they call them deceptive.
[53:51.000 --> 54:01.400]  Just like when Jim Acosta grabbed the microphone back and shoved the young lady in the White House,
[54:02.200 --> 54:05.800]  they said that we doctored the tape for zooming in on it so you could see it closer.
[54:06.760 --> 54:13.640]  That's not doctoring, as the president said. So again, a total wall of lies.
[54:13.640 --> 54:17.320]  What is this distracting us from, though, while we're watching this?
[54:17.320 --> 54:21.880]  Well, it's not talking about the corruption of the Democrats, is it? And if the American people
[54:21.880 --> 54:27.240]  don't come out in giant numbers and get control of the House again, and if the Republicans lay
[54:27.240 --> 54:32.200]  there like they did before when they had the House and the Senate and do nothing in the first two years,
[54:32.200 --> 54:37.800]  then God help us because these people are revolutionaries. They're trying to overthrow our country.
[54:39.080 --> 54:45.480]  They're trying to destroy our Republic. They're going for a broke. We're not the ones that
[54:45.480 --> 54:52.680]  we're not the ones that escalated to this point. Let's hear representatives from Alabama. Mike
[54:52.680 --> 54:57.960]  Rogers is talking about. On this hoax and put our nation first. That's exactly what President
[54:57.960 --> 55:02.520]  Trump is doing. The United States has record low unemployment, historic performance in the
[55:02.520 --> 55:10.600]  stock market. President Trump is rewriting failed trade deals of the past to put America first.
[55:10.600 --> 55:16.680]  He's rebuilding our military. He helped create the space force and the list goes on. I implore
[55:16.680 --> 55:23.960]  my colleagues to end the spectacle now. I yield back. Gentlemen yields back. The gentleman reserves.
[55:23.960 --> 55:28.920]  Gentlemen from New York, Mr. Nadler. Mr. Speaker, I'm hearing a lot from my colleagues on the other
[55:28.920 --> 55:34.680]  side of the aisle, except a defense of President Trump's conduct, which is indefensible. I now
[55:34.680 --> 55:38.920]  yield two minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Florida, Mr. Deutsch. The gentleman from
[55:38.920 --> 55:44.520]  Florida is recognized. Some say this impeachment is about eight lines in a call transcript.
[55:45.080 --> 55:50.600]  This guy is one of the biggest liars I've ever seen. This is about a scheme that lasted months
[55:50.600 --> 55:58.600]  and involved. He says that I say nobody died in Parkland, Florida. I never said that. Text messages,
[55:58.600 --> 56:05.000]  emails, calls, and meetings way back in May. That's enough. I can't listen to more of it.
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.560]  We're going to go to your phone calls right when we come back. Jack, William, Matt,
[56:09.560 --> 56:17.080]  Caleb, Levi, Danny, Justin, Javon, Gina, James. Bam, bam, bam, bam. I am getting better about
[56:17.080 --> 56:23.320]  taking calls. I really appreciate you all calling in. And so now we're going to take hour after hour
[56:23.880 --> 56:30.120]  after hour of phone calls today. Mike Adams will be hosting the fourth hour. As I told you,
[56:30.120 --> 56:37.960]  the War Room with Owen Schreuer is going to extend out tonight with Savannah Hernandez and others
[56:38.840 --> 56:43.960]  doing a great job co-hosting. And we've got all the footage of Owen going down to two different
[56:43.960 --> 56:49.240]  impeach Trump rallies in Austin and incredible footage of Savannah being attacked by leftists
[56:49.240 --> 56:56.040]  physically, Owen being attacked, bottles being thrown at them. It's getting insane.
[56:56.040 --> 57:06.520]  It's getting absolutely, totally, and completely out of control. But that's because these people
[57:06.520 --> 57:10.600]  have been taught in the universities that they have a right to rule and that America sucks,
[57:10.600 --> 57:13.400]  that they're the saviors that are going to redistribute everything and save us.
[57:14.280 --> 57:18.840]  We're going to go to break. Please don't forget that Info Wars is strong. We're reaching people.
[57:18.840 --> 57:23.000]  We're doing great things thanks to your help. But the department we're not as strong in is
[57:23.000 --> 57:29.800]  financials. I want to expand in 2020 till I'm doing things like spending my major savings
[57:29.800 --> 57:33.640]  to make sure we can do it because I've got to go all in. I can't sit there and watch these people
[57:33.640 --> 57:37.160]  continue to do this. But it makes it so much easier just to do your Christmas shopping at

[1:01:22.360 --> 1:01:29.640]  and TV satellites. All right, let's go ahead and talk to Matt in California. Thanks for calling
[1:01:29.640 --> 1:01:37.160]  you're on the air. Alex, what's up, man? I want to start by wishing everybody a merry,
[1:01:37.160 --> 1:01:44.360]  merry Christmas. Regardless of all of the satanic crap we have to deal with, we still have
[1:01:44.360 --> 1:01:50.520]  that in our hearts. And I want to say that what the Democrats are doing is very reptilian.
[1:01:51.560 --> 1:01:56.360]  They first lie and then they shape shift. Right now they're in the shape shifting
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:02:03.160]  phase. They're now saying we care about the Constitution. We're doing this for America.
[1:02:03.160 --> 1:02:08.120]  We care about our children. And it's funny they're never ever mentioned anything about this in the
[1:02:08.120 --> 1:02:13.880]  past. Well, actually they do say something. They viciously attack America, attack family,
[1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:18.760]  attack capitalism for the average person, make themselves all tax exempt while attacking
[1:02:18.760 --> 1:02:24.280]  anybody that's middle class. But you're right. They hate America, they hate the family,
[1:02:24.280 --> 1:02:29.080]  but now they suddenly love it. That's extremely transparent. Do they not know how ridiculous
[1:02:29.080 --> 1:02:36.520]  this looks? Yeah, I mean, I created a hat with a maggot hat. It just says, I know you are, but
[1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:42.040]  what am I on it? So anytime a leftist comes up and I see your hat and they're about to just say,
[1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:50.920]  you're a racist. I know you are, but what am I? It just blows their minds up.
[1:02:50.920 --> 1:02:54.360]  God bless you, sir. I appreciate your call, Matt. We're going to move quick here.
[1:02:55.160 --> 1:02:59.640]  Let's talk to William in Michigan and then Jack and Georgia. William, welcome.
[1:03:00.680 --> 1:03:04.680]  Hey, how's it going? Thanks for taking my call. First off, I start my day off with your super
[1:03:04.680 --> 1:03:09.320]  blue. Then I go into the bio trusilinium, the krill oil, X2, X3, your new fossil beef,
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:13.800]  this phenomenal living defense, ultra 12 and honor roll for my kids. I hope you get that back
[1:03:13.800 --> 1:03:18.680]  in soon. I just wanted to go over the states right now. If you look at the battle I'm being
[1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:23.320]  drawn, you have the right to carry the second amendment, open carry and the heartbeat bill,
[1:03:23.320 --> 1:03:28.760]  where if you're an infant and you're in your mom's womb and you have a heartbeat, you can't kill the
[1:03:28.760 --> 1:03:32.600]  baby. Sorry. And then you have the other states that have drawn their battle line saying, okay,
[1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:36.680]  we're going to take all your guns, look at Governor Northam and Virginia, what he's doing up there.
[1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:40.520]  We're going to take all your guns and you can have abortion after the baby is dead,
[1:03:40.520 --> 1:03:45.480]  make them comfortable. But also if you bring in quantum computing, the breakers that they've had
[1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:50.120]  in that into it, and you bring in the interest rates throughout the globe, zero to negative
[1:03:50.120 --> 1:03:53.560]  interest rates, you look at China, they're going to be pushing into Hong Kong or are you there and
[1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:58.200]  they're going to push Taiwan, I think, after the election, regardless who wins. And if you look at the
[1:03:58.200 --> 1:04:02.360]  Temple of Solomon, there's all sorts of facts that are coming out that it was originally in the
[1:04:02.360 --> 1:04:07.480]  city of David and it was on the southeast ridge and the dimensions all fit. So if they rebuild the
[1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:12.840]  temple there and they find out and, okay, that's where it's at, and then you bring into the equation
[1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:20.920]  12 to 13 years away from the exact date that Jesus was killed. I mean, it's kind of living
[1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:25.480]  revelations, everything's kind of coming together and if we're Babylon, we're going to fall soon.
[1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:30.440]  Look what's going on in our country. Well, look at how the Clintons, and we know they're really
[1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:35.720]  behind it, bombed Olympic Park in 96 at the Olympics, then tried to blame Richard Joule,
[1:04:35.720 --> 1:04:41.800]  then tried to blame other people, but they were the ones that did it 200 years after 1776.
[1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:46.440]  So you're absolutely right. The devil is an army president, but he tries to line it up with what
[1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:51.560]  the things God's done as part of his blasphemy. Thank you, William. Jack, we'll talk to you
[1:04:51.560 --> 1:04:59.960]  in 60 seconds. Stay with us. I'm here to give the listeners and viewers a project report
[1:04:59.960 --> 1:05:05.880]  in the next 60 seconds. And here's the bottom line. I'm not playing around. I'm not screwing
[1:05:05.880 --> 1:05:12.280]  around. I'm not joking. And neither are you. Info wars and this operation we built together
[1:05:12.280 --> 1:05:17.960]  has delivered for America has delivered for our children and the unborn has delivered
[1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:24.840]  in the face of toxic fluoride and the GMOs and the deadly vaccine depopulation operation.
[1:05:24.840 --> 1:05:32.920]  What we're doing is beyond critical. And you hear the key word? What we are doing is beyond
[1:05:32.920 --> 1:05:39.560]  critical. So this is the time with the biggest sales ever during Christmas at info wars tour
[1:05:39.560 --> 1:05:45.400]  dot com to get in there and buy these products that you already need that I need the funding for
[1:05:45.400 --> 1:05:51.880]  to get this operation to the next level. I need the money. I need to be able to fight the globalist.
[1:05:51.880 --> 1:06:10.600]  I need you. You need these products. Get them at info wars tour dot com. Waging war on corruption.
[1:06:10.600 --> 1:06:15.880]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:27.080]  The impeachment of President Donald John Trump is live and we have continued coverage
[1:06:27.080 --> 1:06:34.920]  of the ongoing debates that should be concluded right during prime time tonight.
[1:06:35.880 --> 1:06:40.040]  Lay out. Look at the clock. The debate just started less than an hour ago.
[1:06:40.040 --> 1:06:50.120]  So that should come in about seven o'clock eastern between six thirty seven o'clock eastern.
[1:06:50.120 --> 1:06:52.360]  We'll have live coverage here right after the war.
[1:06:52.360 --> 1:06:54.360]  And tonight without Troy or Savannah Hernandez.
[1:06:55.160 --> 1:07:00.520]  So as I'm done going to my daughter's choir recital, I will be here as well.
[1:07:03.080 --> 1:07:08.920]  Like Adams was going to be hosting the fourth hour, but we have Mountain Juniper fever here
[1:07:08.920 --> 1:07:14.280]  as it's known when it comes. It's huge clouds of it. It's not an indigenous plant.
[1:07:15.080 --> 1:07:18.760]  And it coats the lungs. People think they have a cold.
[1:07:20.200 --> 1:07:24.280]  If I wasn't taking pollen block literally at info wars live dot com product,
[1:07:24.280 --> 1:07:27.560]  this would be 10 times worse for me. So I'm not really feeling discomfort.
[1:07:27.560 --> 1:07:31.400]  I just have it coding by larynx a little bit of the sniffles.
[1:07:31.400 --> 1:07:35.720]  But a lot of folks are knocked down by you can actually see it coming off the trees.
[1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:41.240]  That guy's typing to you to cedar trees pollen Austin, Texas.
[1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:46.520]  And you'll see a tree when it releases. It's called all this orange yellow goes off of it.
[1:07:47.400 --> 1:07:54.600]  And it's unbelievable what it does to people. But I want Shroyer is going to be hosting the
[1:07:54.600 --> 1:08:00.040]  fourth hour right through the war room with Savannah Hernandez and live coverage of this.
[1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:07.080]  Why is it happening because they've held up all this legislation to renegotiate and get
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:12.440]  in the World Trade Organization deals, which China and Mexico are hating because there are a lot
[1:08:12.440 --> 1:08:18.440]  better deals for us. It changes the subject from all the crimes they've committed.
[1:08:18.440 --> 1:08:23.320]  And they believe it further divides the nation. But as a caller said yesterday, very astutely,
[1:08:25.400 --> 1:08:28.920]  we've reached the apex of division in America. People now see through it.
[1:08:28.920 --> 1:08:33.880]  So they've hit as much division as they're going to get with the tactics they've been using.
[1:08:33.880 --> 1:08:38.120]  So now people are starting to come together. They've hit the peak.
[1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:45.640]  But they still can't stop and say face. So what are they going to do? What are they going to pull?
[1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:51.800]  That is the question because they can't help but exercise the power they've got in the house.
[1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:58.520]  Because that's what I've learned about the occult and Satanist and globalist is their one-dimension.
[1:08:58.520 --> 1:09:03.400]  And they just can't help but use power even if it destroys them. But are we going to be pissed
[1:09:03.400 --> 1:09:07.720]  about this? Are we going to remember this in 320 days during the election? Are we going to
[1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:12.200]  route these Democrats out and route all these Republican blue bloods out? Are we going to do it?
[1:09:12.200 --> 1:09:21.320]  Jack says he's Air Force Vet, DOJ. America needs to fight back. Give us your take on this situation.
[1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:27.640]  Yes, sir. First of all, quick aside, brother, I love you and your whole crew. I've probably done
[1:09:27.640 --> 1:09:31.000]  20 grand with your products in the last couple of years because they've worked.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:34.520]  You're the only reason we're on air, brother. So thank you. Thank you for keeping me in the fight.
[1:09:34.520 --> 1:09:37.720]  Thank you. Sir, sir, sir, happy to help.
[1:09:37.720 --> 1:09:44.440]  Absolutely. Unless these folks start going to prison for real crimes, everything you've said,
[1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:49.480]  Alex, has been 100% on the money. We know they traded Nick's secrets. I read the reports when
[1:09:49.480 --> 1:09:54.520]  I was in. It's a fact to the Chinese. We know they traded off our yellow cakes, the Russians.
[1:09:54.520 --> 1:10:00.280]  We know absolutely beyond a doubt they have crimes. So unless this void is met with justice,
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:06.360]  this is going to explode. The pressure cooker has to be diffused, has to be.
[1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:11.800]  So I'm thinking the real Andy Jackson moment, it's got to happen. Maybe it takes us,
[1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:16.200]  maybe it takes people to push this. Maybe it needs to popularize memes, whatever,
[1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:17.960]  but we have to have the real Andy Jackson.
[1:10:20.600 --> 1:10:24.360]  You're absolutely right, sir. What do you think is coming next and how do we counter it?
[1:10:25.880 --> 1:10:30.120]  Well, I agree with your previous assessment. I believe this is a spiritual war and I believe
[1:10:30.120 --> 1:10:34.360]  that it's kind of like, you know, I'm not going to jump off into this too much, but
[1:10:34.360 --> 1:10:41.560]  it's like John the Baptist says, as he gains, I diminish. Well, the devil is diminishing
[1:10:41.560 --> 1:10:46.280]  and Christ is gaining. And we do want you to take time. We've got a guest coming up,
[1:10:46.280 --> 1:10:49.960]  but we're going to take calls throughout this and you're absolutely right. As I've gotten older,
[1:10:49.960 --> 1:10:53.320]  I learned how important and real the Bible is when I was young and ignorant. I couldn't
[1:10:53.320 --> 1:10:57.160]  understand it. Now that I've been through a bunch of stuff and now it's all right.
[1:10:57.160 --> 1:11:01.640]  They're emblazoned. And absolutely that's what's happening is they're diminishing.
[1:11:01.640 --> 1:11:06.680]  They're getting stupider. They're falling apart. And then those of us that are with Christ are
[1:11:06.680 --> 1:11:12.440]  getting stronger and greater discernment and they see that and are absolutely going into a rage right
[1:11:12.440 --> 1:11:21.000]  now. Yes, sir. 100%. In fact, there are two, I'm Catholic and much like, oh, and I have the same
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:27.880]  kind of background. And if you look to both Pope Leo, which inspires the warrior prayer
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:35.160]  to St. Michael and Fatima, both of those dovetail precisely into 2017. And that is,
[1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:40.440]  I believe that apex that you were talking about around October of 17. And if you've noticed since
[1:11:40.440 --> 1:11:45.560]  then, their cries and screaming of these demons have only increased. I mean, you're on the street
[1:11:45.560 --> 1:11:49.960]  with them every day. So it's, it's fascinating to watch them come apart. And by the way,
[1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:55.080]  everybody's seen the videos. They now, at least a third of the Democrats at rallies go,
[1:11:55.080 --> 1:11:59.400]  I love Satan and I'm going to tell you, I want babies. I want to hurt babies. I mean, I've got
[1:11:59.400 --> 1:12:04.520]  video and you're like, you love, yes, and Satan will get you. You're going down Jones and we're
[1:12:04.520 --> 1:12:11.000]  going to get your family. I mean, it's like the exorcist. Not only will Satan not win,
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  but the ultimate humility to Satan is he will be crushed by God's creation. In fact, the Bible
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:22.200]  speaks to that clearly. He'll be created. His head will be crushed under the heel of the woman,
[1:12:22.200 --> 1:12:26.360]  which refers, I believe to Virgin Mary. And I believe that's exactly what he's saying.
[1:12:26.360 --> 1:12:32.120]  So that's the ultimate humiliation for this scumbag is he's going to be crushed by what
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:38.840]  he used is inferior creation. I appreciate your call. Great points. Thank you so much, Jack.
[1:12:39.400 --> 1:12:44.760]  I know this. We're living in historical times and the demons are coming out of people. You're
[1:12:44.760 --> 1:12:49.000]  seeing it all over the place. And it's really the battle lines are becoming clear. Call it
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:54.840]  whatever you want. I mean, it's crazy. It happens all over the world. It happens historically and
[1:12:54.840 --> 1:13:02.360]  it's happening again. Levi in Texas. Thanks for calling. Welcome. Hey, Alex, I'll make this really
[1:13:02.360 --> 1:13:07.480]  quick for you. Yesterday you asked this question, what are they going to do? And I prayed about it.
[1:13:08.040 --> 1:13:17.400]  And two events happened last night that the deep state tipped their hand. Virginia, the reason why
[1:13:17.400 --> 1:13:24.440]  they're going after Virginia with the firearms is to declare martial law. Now watch how this unfolds.
[1:13:25.240 --> 1:13:31.480]  In the in the press in the past two weeks, they've been screaming that the Republicans in the Senate
[1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:38.280]  are have already made up their mind. They've already decided that they're just going to sham the trial.
[1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:50.360]  Okay. And last night, the Virginia rep McEachin came out and said, again, that they're going
[1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:57.160]  to call in the National Guard and they're going to arrest all the sheriffs and enforce. No,
[1:13:57.160 --> 1:14:01.400]  you're right. In fact, I saw that last night and I went and looked it up and the reps are
[1:14:01.400 --> 1:14:05.800]  saying it. And I meant to start the show with that today. It's actually in there in my office on the
[1:14:05.800 --> 1:14:10.440]  desk and then I got distracted with the impeachment vote. But absolutely and it's in all the different
[1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:15.160]  Soros documents that have come out. They want to trigger a race war or a civil war and they want
[1:14:15.160 --> 1:14:20.440]  to do it with gun confiscation. They own Northam because you got caught in the KKK outfit and
[1:14:20.440 --> 1:14:26.920]  saying kill the babies after they're born, keeping comfortable. And so they are absolutely trying
[1:14:26.920 --> 1:14:33.320]  to start a civil war. There it is. ABC News 13. Representative Rep says military enforcement
[1:14:33.320 --> 1:14:40.840]  for new gun legislation, national guard response. I mean, that's ABC News. And we live in this
[1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:46.600]  craziness that Alex Jones has been conditioned just to accept the level of tyranny that I didn't
[1:14:46.600 --> 1:14:50.680]  start the show with that. In fact, download that newscast. That's what I watched last night.
[1:14:50.680 --> 1:14:54.120]  I remember two days ago, it's like, there's a rumor they're going to have the National Guard.
[1:14:54.120 --> 1:14:59.320]  No, they're in the state house saying we're going to arrest sheriffs that don't confiscate the guns.
[1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:04.360]  We're going to register and take all the semi autos. And I mean, yeah, and they know that'll
[1:15:04.360 --> 1:15:12.440]  cause a civil war. You are damn right, Levi. Go ahead. Wait, there's more. Last night around 10
[1:15:12.440 --> 1:15:23.240]  PM, Ginsburg talked to CNN and she made comments about the Republicans deciding. And she said
[1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:29.080]  that if a judge made that, they would be removed from the case. Here's what I believe is going to
[1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:34.920]  happen. They're going to position Virginia to go into a state of martial law. Hold on. Hold on.
[1:15:34.920 --> 1:15:38.360]  Don't hang up. I'm not doing a cliffhanger. We have to go to breaks at certain times as a
[1:15:38.360 --> 1:15:42.040]  satellite's fire for radio and TV stations coming right back to you in just a few minutes. Levi,
[1:15:42.040 --> 1:15:49.080]  stay there. Stay there. And then James, Gina, Lee, Aaron, Caleb, Jerry, just everybody stay
[1:15:49.080 --> 1:15:53.240]  with us, spread the word about the live broadcast. It's all happening. They want the UN to confiscate
[1:15:53.240 --> 1:15:59.960]  the guns. That's official. Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure,

[1:20:23.720 --> 1:20:27.400]  We are receiving this transmission. You are the resistance.
[1:20:29.080 --> 1:20:33.960]  The globalists have only captured the main blue cities on the east and west coast.
[1:20:35.880 --> 1:20:40.040]  Once they get control there's pure election fraud and the people are literally enslaved.
[1:20:40.040 --> 1:20:46.920]  Look at that math in congress. Right now the areas in red are republican are populist. Love
[1:20:46.920 --> 1:20:55.960]  America the areas in blue are captured globalist zones. Now Obama had a plan under strong cities
[1:20:55.960 --> 1:21:05.240]  initiative of the united nations to confiscate firearms and to create a civil emergency out of
[1:21:05.240 --> 1:21:12.280]  it. Bloomberg has funded the election of hundreds of district attorneys and sheriffs to begin on
[1:21:12.280 --> 1:21:20.760]  confiscation under red flag laws in democrat controlled states. It's happening. And now
[1:21:21.640 --> 1:21:28.040]  here's the headline ABC news. Virginia rep suggests military enforcement for new gun
[1:21:28.040 --> 1:21:34.600]  legislation national guard response. He said that three days ago now more democrats have joined him.
[1:21:35.160 --> 1:21:39.400]  The governor has said we're going to register your guns and then we're going to pass a law
[1:21:39.400 --> 1:21:45.720]  law to take them and sheriffs that don't go along with it. We're going to come after you.
[1:21:45.720 --> 1:21:53.320]  So this is how civil war started. The last two wars for independence and the civil war started
[1:21:53.320 --> 1:22:00.360]  in Virginia. So history doesn't just rhyme. It repeats. Levi in Texas recap what you were saying
[1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:03.960]  and then lay this out because democrats admit they want to cause a civil war.
[1:22:03.960 --> 1:22:11.640]  They want to push us into open confrontation and they have got control of the system in
[1:22:11.640 --> 1:22:16.840]  Virginia now the courts the governorship and of course the legislature and they're making
[1:22:16.840 --> 1:22:21.960]  their move. People say well it'll cause a war. That's the plan my dear Watson. Please continue.
[1:22:21.960 --> 1:22:34.440]  OK. The important thing about Virginia is that it is south of Washington D.C. There's oh by
[1:22:34.440 --> 1:22:47.800]  declaring martial law in Virginia it'll shut down interstate 81 95 66 77 85 64 and that will
[1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:55.000]  isolate Washington D.C. with only one interstate coming in from the west from in Maryland which
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:23:00.920]  is interstate 68. And they don't need to worry about north because all of that is Democrat
[1:23:00.920 --> 1:23:06.600]  controlled territory. Now they're going to move on this. And like I said for the past two weeks
[1:23:07.480 --> 1:23:15.000]  the press has been running that the Republicans in the Senate are shooting their mouth off
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:19.960]  especially Mitch McConnell Lindsey Graham and others that they've already made up their mind
[1:23:19.960 --> 1:23:24.200]  they're going to coordinate with the Trump administration. OK. They're not going to call
[1:23:24.200 --> 1:23:34.760]  any witnesses. OK. It's being painted as a farce trial. They won't allow Schumer to call in OK
[1:23:35.480 --> 1:23:40.520]  witnesses claiming that it's that it's not going to become like the House became.
[1:23:40.520 --> 1:23:49.880]  This is all being set up to give the Democrats. Once the trial is over Trump will be acquitted
[1:23:49.880 --> 1:23:57.880]  in the Senate. But it's a trap. It is a a tape Brutee moment because the Democrats are then going
[1:23:57.880 --> 1:24:04.680]  to run to the Supreme Court. And this is where Ginsburg opened her mouth last night the CNN
[1:24:04.680 --> 1:24:12.040]  and she let the cat out of the bag. The run to the Supreme Court and the insurance policy
[1:24:12.040 --> 1:24:18.920]  that Stortz and Page were talking about is Chief Justice Robert who I believe with all my heart
[1:24:18.920 --> 1:24:26.600]  is compromised. He's going to be on the Senate. He's going to be controlling the trial. The
[1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:32.520]  Democrats will file a brief with the United States Supreme Court saying that the trial was a sham
[1:24:32.520 --> 1:24:36.600]  that the Republicans already made up their mind before they heard any of the evidence that it
[1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:46.200]  was tainted. And I believe that the Supreme Court will rule that the trial is defunct. It's bad.
[1:24:46.920 --> 1:24:53.480]  And that they by a liberal majority with the swing vote being Chief Justice Roberts will
[1:24:53.480 --> 1:25:00.600]  remove the president of the United States on legal technicalities. And at the same time they do this
[1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:07.400]  Virginia will declare martial law shutting down all the interstates preventing people from amassing
[1:25:07.400 --> 1:25:13.160]  on Washington in anger because they'll be able to control and shut down all routes of travel into
[1:25:13.160 --> 1:25:20.120]  Washington. And it will plunge this nation into civil unrest like you haven't believed. I prayed
[1:25:20.120 --> 1:25:26.440]  about this last night. And this is what I believe the Lord showed me their plan is and well that's
[1:25:26.440 --> 1:25:31.160]  why people got to go to DC now. I've been saying don't wait. Everybody needs to get up there. We've
[1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:36.120]  had our crew there. Well Johnson's there. I intend to go back up there. People need to get there and
[1:25:36.120 --> 1:25:40.280]  let them know. But I agree with you when you read all their different documents they want civil war
[1:25:40.280 --> 1:25:46.040]  they want civil unrest. They want confrontations because they're losing. And that's why they're
[1:25:46.040 --> 1:25:53.400]  putting us into this impeachment hoping as Senator Paul said on Monday to trigger civil unrest. Levi
[1:25:53.400 --> 1:25:58.440]  they're going for broke. And I think this is a real scenario. I'm not saying it's going to happen
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:02.840]  but the Democrats have taken the guns everywhere else. They're in control. They are priming things
[1:26:02.840 --> 1:26:09.240]  in Virginia to start a fight. And I think Beto was a test of that saying hell yes we're coming
[1:26:09.240 --> 1:26:13.800]  after your AR 15s. None of that's happened by accident. So I agree this is something they're
[1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:19.720]  wargaming exposing it has a good chance of stopping it. You're a smart cookie. What else do you think
[1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:27.320]  we can do to make sure this doesn't happen. Everybody first off first and foremost my
[1:26:27.320 --> 1:26:34.120]  brothers and sisters in Christ need to realize that God doesn't use perfect people. We need
[1:26:34.120 --> 1:26:41.080]  to come together in prayer for Trump. Trump needs to open up his eyes and realize that he
[1:26:41.080 --> 1:26:48.280]  cannot do this alone. He has got to start. He should have he should be getting rid of people.
[1:26:48.280 --> 1:26:56.200]  I want to know why. Okay. Brennan still has his security clearance. Trump revoked it and he still
[1:26:56.200 --> 1:27:01.800]  has it. Why aren't those people open rebellion. It's why I try to keep the president isolated so
[1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:08.360]  he doesn't know what's going on. No he needs no he he look he needs to not only talk softly but
[1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:13.480]  he needs to carry on. We're out of time. We're going to watch this Virginia situation very very
[1:27:13.480 --> 1:27:19.960]  closely as it unfolds. It's really happening. You're absolutely right. This is the hill. Virginia
[1:27:19.960 --> 1:27:25.160]  National Guard responds after Democrat lawmakers suggest maybe needed to enforce gun control
[1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:29.640]  measures using the military. Well they've used the UN everywhere else all the blue cities they've
[1:27:29.640 --> 1:27:33.480]  taken the guns. They want to try to use the 25th Amendment against the president to remove him.
[1:27:34.280 --> 1:27:38.840]  They won't need the votes in the Senate if they create another hysteria. That's their plan doesn't
[1:27:38.840 --> 1:27:44.920]  mean they're going to succeed but they're making a run at it and these people are outrageous criminals.
[1:27:44.920 --> 1:27:50.920]  The woman up on the dies right now representative Karen Bass in California. She says if this doesn't
[1:27:50.920 --> 1:27:55.000]  work he gets reelected they're going to try to impeach him again. Don't even know what for
[1:27:55.800 --> 1:28:00.120]  or she said oh because he's a russian agent. You're a globalist agent. You're an anti-american
[1:28:00.120 --> 1:28:05.640]  filth. You're a puppet. You're a nobody. Pick because you were scum running California into the
[1:28:05.640 --> 1:28:10.840]  ground which more of your phone calls right when I come back from break. I'm taking seven phone

[1:31:03.560 --> 1:31:09.080]  They think that Christians are done and finished. They believe they've broken our backs. They believe
[1:31:09.080 --> 1:31:14.360]  that with big tech censorship will just crawl into dishes and submit to them and they believe that if
[1:31:14.360 --> 1:31:19.720]  they can demonize and shut down info wars that they rightfully see as a symbol of beacon of
[1:31:19.720 --> 1:31:24.440]  populism and freedom not just to America but to the whole world that they can demoralize everybody
[1:31:24.440 --> 1:31:29.160]  else and win why they can shut info wars down they can intimidate everybody else. That's why it's
[1:31:29.160 --> 1:31:34.200]  beyond critical that you keep info wars on the air. It's only by your word of mouth, your prayer,

[1:32:15.240 --> 1:32:21.000]  children but our children's children. Info wars really has changed history and that's why I need
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:26.040]  to pull back and ask the listeners because I know you're a lot like me to really think about a world
[1:32:26.040 --> 1:32:31.320]  without info wars because I can tell you right now if people don't really step to the plate

[1:33:20.520 --> 1:33:26.840]  Epic is overused and so when it's time to say things are epic and when I go yeah right epic
[1:33:26.840 --> 1:33:31.880]  no this what's going on is epically bad, epically out of control but the response to it is epic.
[1:33:31.880 --> 1:33:37.800]  There are so many videos coming out of globalist politicians being confronted by patriots and
[1:33:37.800 --> 1:33:44.120]  almost every case they're saying info wars.com is the battle cry just like Jeffrey Epstein didn't
[1:33:44.120 --> 1:33:49.640]  kill himself showing people are awake it's amazing. We've got our own Owen in Cervana Hernandez
[1:33:49.640 --> 1:33:55.000]  being attacked last night. We've got video info warrior attacked by libs that's really fascist
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:34:00.600]  for crashing LA Trump impeachment rally that footage is coming up Ezra Levant of the rebel
[1:34:00.600 --> 1:34:07.160]  media will be in studio with us there is so much to cover a lot of it doesn't get on air and it's
[1:34:07.160 --> 1:34:13.240]  just as important it's at info wars.com and it's at news wars.com but make no mistake these are
[1:34:13.240 --> 1:34:18.280]  authoritarians Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court came out on Fox News was interviewed and said
[1:34:18.280 --> 1:34:24.280]  Merry Christmas and the left's going crazy calling it a hate crime I'm not joking
[1:34:24.280 --> 1:34:33.000]  these people want total domination of your minds I mean no one would put up with this
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:40.440]  you know in like classic cults but this is it it's it's incredible thank god people are waking up to
[1:34:40.440 --> 1:34:47.640]  them all right who's up next here let's talk to who's been holding the longest let's talk to James
[1:34:47.640 --> 1:34:52.600]  and Indiana James thank you for calling they're going to vote impeach the president today they
[1:34:52.600 --> 1:34:56.600]  believe just that term will discredit him that's just the indictment by this kangaroo group of
[1:34:56.600 --> 1:35:02.200]  democrats what's your view on this well this is what I did today I have never made a donation to
[1:35:02.200 --> 1:35:09.640]  any media outlet in my entire life I just made a $100 donation to info wars.com I am asking in the
[1:35:09.640 --> 1:35:16.040]  next hour that a thousand patriots make a hundred dollars donation to let you be their voice because
[1:35:16.040 --> 1:35:20.280]  there's so many people on the sidelines right now they don't know what to do they don't know how to
[1:35:20.280 --> 1:35:24.920]  react and before I took speech class I couldn't stand up either so I understand these people they
[1:35:24.920 --> 1:35:29.160]  can't say anything or they're afraid to be retaliated by the government because they are crooked
[1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:32.600]  and they will use a justice system to come after people they like you said they're not
[1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:36.760]  just trying to impeach the president right now they're trying to destroy every media outlet that
[1:35:36.760 --> 1:35:43.320]  tells the truth they took over they did a national intelligence infiltration of the nra as russians
[1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:48.840]  almost destroyed the nra shut down their media operation so we we've been hit the same but
[1:35:48.840 --> 1:35:53.400]  we're smaller so they couldn't get us shut down so thank you because we need that support now
[1:35:53.400 --> 1:35:57.560]  we are at the critical tip of the spear we are critical to the fight so thank you because it's
[1:35:57.560 --> 1:36:03.720]  it's neck and neck here for us where do you think all this is going james um president trump posted
[1:36:03.720 --> 1:36:08.680]  if you had a duck duck go it's warren democracy he posted what he sent to pelosi they have a
[1:36:08.680 --> 1:36:13.400]  poll there from left to right it shows who's for who's not for impeachment it looks like a big penis
[1:36:13.400 --> 1:36:18.920]  the democrats are trying to dick this president and if you also look at um if you search uh congress
[1:36:18.920 --> 1:36:24.200]  has obstructed america uh my article in indiana was just published yesterday it's the only one
[1:36:24.200 --> 1:36:27.960]  on the internet it says they're going to point out all the crap that they're doing if you like

[1:37:00.920 --> 1:37:05.400]  obstructing the country that's working with foreign powers but like i was saying with the

[1:37:54.760 --> 1:37:58.760]  year to do it which is fine i put the money in the house got interest the banks to do that but
[1:37:58.760 --> 1:38:03.960]  we're spending our reserves right now because it is spiritual level i can feel it we need to be a
[1:38:03.960 --> 1:38:07.880]  hundred percent in the fight okay i said i take ten calls just spend four minutes with that guy
[1:38:07.880 --> 1:38:13.480]  who's a red collar thank you uh let's go ahead up next is danie and origan thank you for holding

[1:38:21.880 --> 1:38:27.320]  that's just you know the devil's been trying to endure all of us in every way possible and you
[1:38:27.320 --> 1:38:35.080]  just got to keep at it uh you know it's truly uh just very distrustful and and obvious that the
[1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:41.960]  devil is just wasting full attack on on all of us uh i mean absolutely evil believe in the devil
[1:38:41.960 --> 1:38:49.480]  or not evil is on the march right now but it's causing a massive awakening right i mean you know
[1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:55.800]  i thought of something this morning uh it it kind of boils down the it's kind of two types of people
[1:38:55.800 --> 1:39:00.680]  right now there's there's people who are lying and there's people who know they're being lied to
[1:39:00.680 --> 1:39:05.960]  yes and i mean well there's people that don't know if they're either lying or you're being lied to
[1:39:05.960 --> 1:39:13.080]  one of the two or both uh but you know i really i want to echo what the other gentleman said uh
[1:39:13.080 --> 1:39:18.280]  you know as far as donating them for awards everybody calls in to uh thank you but i want to
[1:39:18.280 --> 1:39:24.120]  you know and and of course you know i love you alex uh but i i'd like to thank the listeners

[1:39:36.360 --> 1:39:42.120]  the thanks just as much as any of us on air and we're all just fighting so hard and the great news
[1:39:42.120 --> 1:39:46.120]  is we're having a big effect i mean if we weren't having a huge effect i would not be killing myself
[1:39:46.120 --> 1:39:50.280]  doing this because i'd say well it's up to somebody else no we've been given the providence
[1:39:50.280 --> 1:39:55.800]  we've been given the discernment we've been given this and i am very humbled by it uh where do you
[1:39:55.800 --> 1:40:06.760]  see all this uh ending up oh well i certainly hope that i'm right in thinking that god uh will
[1:40:06.760 --> 1:40:13.080]  you know be in control uh in the end i mean he will either way but i'm i'm praying and hoping that
[1:40:13.080 --> 1:40:19.720]  uh you know the senate will shut this down as the the joke that it is but you know it's just
[1:40:19.720 --> 1:40:26.920]  alarming to see the the democrat uh side of the government gaslighting the entire country
[1:40:26.920 --> 1:40:32.040]  to say oh you know we're just going to convince you that something happened even though we all
[1:40:32.040 --> 1:40:37.320]  know it didn't you know it's incredible absolutely and it's like it's like they're bad actors thank
[1:40:37.320 --> 1:40:44.040]  you sir gaslighting the whole country they're absolutely attempting to do that and here's a
[1:40:44.040 --> 1:40:49.480]  big question for tomorrow what if they did remove him in the senate what would the removal of
[1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:54.040]  trump look like and then what would they do next to get rid of Pence to put Pelosi in
[1:40:54.040 --> 1:40:58.040]  who they admit they won in who would then make Hillary vice president you know they get rid of
[1:40:58.040 --> 1:41:02.840]  trump hillary's running she's just waiting to the convention six months out from now

[1:47:38.200 --> 1:47:43.240]  the known shroyer is taking over in the fourth hour i'm gonna host three plus hours of war room
[1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:48.680]  i'll be back as well this evening for live coverage of the historic impeachment of trump
[1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:55.720]  and the house again that's just the indictment like the grand jury and we've got a host of
[1:47:55.720 --> 1:48:06.360]  issues to get to here your calls at 877-789-2539 ezra levant heads up rebelnews.com and i go over
[1:48:06.360 --> 1:48:11.080]  his old bio it would take quite a while but he's launched for the most successful media operations
[1:48:11.080 --> 1:48:16.920]  in canada on mainstream tv it got huge ratings and then the state regulators came in and shut
[1:48:16.920 --> 1:48:21.720]  down their speech yes ladies and gentlemen then he's launched the rebel news has been very
[1:48:21.720 --> 1:48:28.680]  successful with tommy robinson and people like gab mcginnis and so many others without him those
[1:48:28.680 --> 1:48:33.240]  folks would never have even had some of those platforms when they before they got de-platformed
[1:48:33.240 --> 1:48:39.320]  and once they did so we're really blessed to have ezra levant out there because there's not a lot of
[1:48:39.320 --> 1:48:43.320]  people putting their money with their mouth is so we're very thankful to have them here you're
[1:48:43.320 --> 1:48:48.440]  you're a smart guy a nuanced fellow why would the democrats launch this when even their internal
[1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:53.560]  poll showed it was unpopular three months ago now it's proven to be spectacularly unpopular
[1:48:53.560 --> 1:48:57.320]  it's a platform now in the senate to show all the corruption that they've been involved in
[1:48:57.320 --> 1:49:04.920]  that they projected on to trump what do you expect them to do why couldn't they help themselves
[1:49:04.920 --> 1:49:10.120]  how did they do it what are the different scenarios i don't want to be too confident here how could
[1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:16.760]  they uh turn lemons and eliminate ezra what do you think you pay attention more than 99.9 of
[1:49:16.760 --> 1:49:21.320]  people most people don't read a newspaper most people get their news from the late night comedy
[1:49:21.320 --> 1:49:29.400]  shows and so all you're gonna see is the one clip and that'll be all i think 80 of people know
[1:49:29.400 --> 1:49:35.240]  and in six nine months from now the waters will be muddy it'll just be trump was impeached forget
[1:49:35.240 --> 1:49:40.280]  the details forget how they made the sausage you and i follow the minutiae but most people don't
[1:49:40.280 --> 1:49:47.080]  have time for that so all that will be left is the stain of the accusation exactly just the word
[1:49:47.080 --> 1:49:54.040]  impeachment and then reading the charge and you can see them saying he was impeached he was impeached
[1:49:54.040 --> 1:49:59.240]  yeah it's a talking point that they'll be able to it's an asterisk they can forever stick to
[1:49:59.240 --> 1:50:03.880]  his name do you think they've miscalculated i mean looking out there at the american people
[1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:08.920]  how do you think they're gonna respond to this if they're already getting pissed off i see trump
[1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:15.240]  himself has tweeted polls showing that he now leads every democratic contender i think right now
[1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:20.280]  people are thinking leave this to the election why are you impeaching a guy let's have it out i
[1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:26.040]  think there's fair-minded americans even democrats reminds me of brexit in a way there were people
[1:50:26.040 --> 1:50:31.960]  who voted to remain in the eu but when they saw the shenanigans the establishment trying to squash
[1:50:31.960 --> 1:50:37.880]  the vote they said whoa i wanted to remain but not this way so why are the democrats tone deaf then
[1:50:37.880 --> 1:50:43.880]  if this is ultimately going to hurt them 80 chance let's be you know fair with it maybe they're
[1:50:43.880 --> 1:50:50.040]  going to pull a rabbit out of a hat why couldn't they i mean why'd they do it why did they it's
[1:50:50.040 --> 1:50:54.440]  like hitler he was already losing world war two why do you attack russia i mean it's it's like
[1:50:54.440 --> 1:50:59.640]  getting my ass kicked over here in africa let me just go attack you know guys that destroyed napoleon
[1:50:59.640 --> 1:51:05.400]  i think a couple of reasons first of all uh some of them are victims of trump derangement syndrome
[1:51:05.400 --> 1:51:12.200]  they truly think he's so evil he must have done some that's it they're crazed yeah and uh you know
[1:51:12.200 --> 1:51:17.240]  people have said trump equals hitler trump equals hitler so often if you actually believe that you
[1:51:17.240 --> 1:51:22.520]  would do anything in your power to stop them you know it's like the old uh imagination game if you
[1:51:22.520 --> 1:51:27.560]  could go back in time would you kill baby hitler if you thought donald trump if you actually believed
[1:51:27.560 --> 1:51:31.320]  he was evil you would do anything so there's a certain percent of people will just buy whatever
[1:51:31.320 --> 1:51:36.440]  they're told yeah and who's calling the shots in congress is it nancy plosy or is it the radical
[1:51:36.440 --> 1:51:41.960]  squad ilhan omar i think they are yeah and and so i think this train has started and they because
[1:51:41.960 --> 1:51:47.480]  they represent what the left has really fully radicalized into yeah i don't know if that's
[1:51:47.480 --> 1:51:52.040]  going to work in the general election but it sure is hot right now and everyone in the president's
[1:51:52.040 --> 1:51:56.200]  from primaries boy they're tacking left let let's shift gears to where you really i mean
[1:51:56.200 --> 1:52:00.040]  because you're an expert on canadian politics u.s politics you you cover them all for many years
[1:52:01.160 --> 1:52:06.840]  you called what happened with boris johnson a third of the labor party defecting conservatives
[1:52:06.840 --> 1:52:12.440]  for the first time i've ever seen a majority even in a parliamentary system for the tories
[1:52:12.440 --> 1:52:18.840]  um by the left i've been told and then and that's what paul oxen's saying over in the
[1:52:18.840 --> 1:52:23.400]  uk that's ferocious saying you're you're big in the uk you've put a lot of time there that the
[1:52:23.400 --> 1:52:28.120]  telling labor voters you better allow millions of muslims to come in you better send your kids to
[1:52:28.120 --> 1:52:32.680]  moss to pray as they do at field trips you better submit to the grooming gangs you better you know
[1:52:32.680 --> 1:52:38.680]  hate the uk you know white people are racist that brainwashing really backfired and has basically
[1:52:38.680 --> 1:52:43.960]  not just crippled some are saying destroyed the labor party and totally backfired they went so far
[1:52:43.960 --> 1:52:50.200]  they went even farther than aoc and the squad went here jeremy corbin i mean he was posing with a
[1:52:50.200 --> 1:52:55.720]  hezbollah terrorist flag he like he was so far out there and in turn so walk through walk through
[1:52:55.720 --> 1:52:59.960]  why people okay why do we care about boris johnson well it's a bellwether for the rest of the world
[1:52:59.960 --> 1:53:06.760]  just like riggs it was a bellwether for trump you know absolutely everyone was against brexit
[1:53:07.720 --> 1:53:12.680]  except the people the media even all the political parties even though the conservatives
[1:53:12.680 --> 1:53:18.920]  said they were for it they weren't really the media the banks any international agency i even
[1:53:18.920 --> 1:53:23.640]  saw the british sandwich association said if brexit goes through you won't have good sandwiches
[1:53:23.640 --> 1:53:30.360]  anymore i'm not making that up so everyone was against it but i think it was a way for people to
[1:53:30.360 --> 1:53:34.360]  lash back at the establishment whether the grievance was open borders immigration
[1:53:35.640 --> 1:53:40.280]  you know and what that does driving down wages driving up real estate extremely expensive there
[1:53:40.280 --> 1:53:47.640]  the islamification of the uk i i think it was also i mean the un we don't like the un in canada
[1:53:47.640 --> 1:53:52.120]  united states but imagine if the un actually passed laws that were binding in america and can
[1:53:52.120 --> 1:53:58.280]  that's what the european union was to the to the uk so it was a great throwing off sort of like
[1:53:58.280 --> 1:54:03.880]  trump's victory was a great so this is a real rebellion i think and and i tell you boris johnson
[1:54:03.880 --> 1:54:10.040]  if he does he will go through with it but if not i think they've destroyed the threat of democracy
[1:54:10.040 --> 1:54:15.160]  there because you the if you play a game you got to be bound by the rules brexit won and for three
[1:54:15.160 --> 1:54:19.800]  years they've delayed it you have no idea the damage that did to the rule of law the respect for
[1:54:19.800 --> 1:54:23.560]  authority in that country in some ways it's good people are dissidents well you're right so first
[1:54:23.560 --> 1:54:27.960]  they said four years ago that brexit was an anomaly that all these other populace got elected
[1:54:28.920 --> 1:54:32.840]  merkel's barely hanging on playing games with you know parliament numbers but her parties have been
[1:54:32.840 --> 1:54:39.320]  routed out of power mainly now some say germany's next and and now this is a real global realignment
[1:54:39.320 --> 1:54:45.880]  to populism nationalism uh and really to western values i think well and i want to talk about the
[1:54:45.880 --> 1:54:50.920]  most interesting pro democracy pro freedom anti-establishment force in the world right now
[1:54:51.560 --> 1:54:56.120]  i'm talking about the hong kong protests oh yes because they haven't had a lot of support from
[1:54:56.120 --> 1:55:01.480]  around the world i mean the american congress voted in their support thumbs up but where are all the
[1:55:01.480 --> 1:55:05.560]  left-wing human rights activists where's the amnesty internationals where are the reporters
[1:55:05.560 --> 1:55:10.920]  without borders where's all those people well they're in league with china either ideologically
[1:55:10.920 --> 1:55:17.640]  they're sympathetic or they like china as a counterweight to america or they want to make money
[1:55:17.640 --> 1:55:22.760]  you know people look at china and see the huge market these democracy protesters they're going
[1:55:22.760 --> 1:55:27.800]  to mess it up those are the heroes and that's an anti-establishment rebellion too i totally agree
[1:55:27.800 --> 1:55:33.800]  with you why suddenly it's all over the world there is rebellions against establishment against
[1:55:33.800 --> 1:55:39.000]  globalism against neoliberalism against islamic takeover almost every rebellion they're becoming
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:43.720]  successful is whether they're asian or whether they're latin america or whether they're american
[1:55:43.720 --> 1:55:47.720]  european whoever they are they're rebelling against globalism russia's rebelling against
[1:55:47.720 --> 1:55:51.800]  globalism i mean it's all over the place it's a where did it come from you know i saw some polls
[1:55:51.800 --> 1:55:57.000]  in hong kong that hong kong people now regard themselves as an identity before these troubles
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:01.960]  they were chinese they were proudly part of this massive monolith but now no we're hong kong people
[1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:06.040]  you see this same in taiwan no we're not by them trying to take their basic agreements and rights
[1:56:06.040 --> 1:56:11.480]  they had now they've just made them get more radical and a real identity there's a hong kong
[1:56:11.480 --> 1:56:17.800]  identity now and it's amazing to me that they're waving american flags what a symbol if only americans
[1:56:17.800 --> 1:56:24.440]  love those values you know it's sort of eerie to be taught about freedom by folks halfway around the
[1:56:24.440 --> 1:56:29.560]  world and i look at all these anti-flethugs in canada the united states young people they don't
[1:56:29.560 --> 1:56:32.360]  even know what they stand you know what the bible says i mean we should come back talk about this
[1:56:32.360 --> 1:56:36.520]  because you've covered it my reporters have been over there a prophet's not known in his own country
[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:40.920]  and and literally people value us because we're not perfect but they've seen how much better it is
[1:56:40.920 --> 1:56:44.680]  than what they had they aspire to that and the people that have grown up with it like sport
[1:56:44.680 --> 1:56:51.080]  graphs are like yeah well yeah i don't respect anti-fla in america i don't and in canada i don't
[1:56:51.080 --> 1:56:55.480]  think they actually i think many of them are paid i think many of them know they are the street
[1:56:55.480 --> 1:57:01.160]  far good buddy toros big funner well absolutely it's i'm inspired by these young people i mentioned
[1:57:01.160 --> 1:57:06.200]  that because i think i think these things are all around the world oh i say good buddy you're one
[1:57:06.200 --> 1:57:09.800]  of the only other people targeted like i've been with all these fake lawsuits and all this you know
[1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:14.680]  globalist garbage uh i mean they have really really been coming after us that's why you know

[1:59:00.200 --> 1:59:14.520]  yeah but where are the clowns sending the clowns don't bother
[1:59:16.280 --> 1:59:23.880]  there the globalist have sent in the clowns they sent in antifa they've broken our borders with
[1:59:23.880 --> 1:59:28.520]  some of the most hardened criminals from around the world they've tried to poison us with fluoride
[1:59:28.520 --> 1:59:35.000]  at gmo and the tainted vaccines they've sent in their clowns but now the men and women of america
[1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:39.640]  are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere and i'm so proud of info wars
[1:59:39.640 --> 1:59:43.640]  leading the charge but the only way we can do that is when you keep spreading the word about
[1:59:43.640 --> 1:59:46.920]  our broadcast and when you keep buying the great products at info warsaw.com
[1:59:46.920 --> 1:59:59.080]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:59:59.080 --> 2:00:05.080]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[2:00:06.600 --> 2:00:13.880]  i know you can see me now here's a surprise the us pass laws and destroy free speech now
[2:00:13.880 --> 2:00:20.120]  canada's done it by executive fiat justin trudeau who bought his way back into office with the
[2:00:20.120 --> 2:00:24.440]  promise of a giant bailout to the media to throw down the gauntlet and this of course is what's
[2:00:24.440 --> 2:00:28.840]  going to come here next the democrats get back into power your phone calls start next segment
[2:00:29.640 --> 2:00:34.200]  Ezra Levant of rebel media writing shotgun with us tell folks about this draconian move
[2:00:34.920 --> 2:00:40.680]  by trudeau muscling in on social media to censor even more yeah you wouldn't think he'd
[2:00:40.680 --> 2:00:46.520]  need to do it he already has a state broadcaster called the cbc it's bigger than all the rest
[2:00:46.520 --> 2:00:51.480]  of the private media combined that wasn't enough for him so he had a massive bailout of the print
[2:00:51.480 --> 2:00:58.520]  newspapers so he's basically owning a renting 99 percent of the media in the country but there's
[2:00:58.520 --> 2:01:05.560]  just a few holdouts we're one of them so he just can't stand that and so he issued something called
[2:01:05.560 --> 2:01:12.520]  a mandate letter to his cabinet last week and in it he's directed his heritage minister to pass
[2:01:12.520 --> 2:01:21.080]  the regulation so that any social media company that gets a complaint of hate whatever that is
[2:01:21.080 --> 2:01:27.720]  undefined has 24 hours to take it down or suffer a substantial financial penalty you can't have a
[2:01:27.720 --> 2:01:32.360]  trial in 24 hours what if it's saturday night someone makes a complaint you some interns going
[2:01:32.360 --> 2:01:37.960]  to take everything down for fear of these huge penalties that you can't have an appeal that was
[2:01:37.960 --> 2:01:44.280]  published in his mandate letter last week and it creates a total stampede of lemmings a hysteria
[2:01:45.080 --> 2:01:48.600]  and i warned big tech years ago i said you start giving it into the censorship and the threats
[2:01:49.160 --> 2:01:56.120]  it's going to suddenly be do whatever we say really really dangerous i think big tech likes
[2:01:56.120 --> 2:02:02.920]  to censor already we know that they did it to you but this makes them basically on speed dial
[2:02:02.920 --> 2:02:09.640]  for any politician who doesn't like a mean tweet like i say it's so unnecessary they've got 99
[2:02:09.640 --> 2:02:14.920]  percent so how do we counter this because it beyond just a free speech in the private company
[2:02:14.920 --> 2:02:19.640]  argument it's racketeering it's election meddling it's voter suppression what's happening here
[2:02:19.640 --> 2:02:24.920]  is a combine a cartel suppressing speech and bullying people and and and and if the italian
[2:02:24.920 --> 2:02:29.160]  mafia was doing it they'd all be springing from the end of ropes uh or if some other mafia was but
[2:02:29.160 --> 2:02:34.360]  when big tech in the left do it we're supposed to accept it i think there's two things first
[2:02:34.360 --> 2:02:41.560]  believe it or not this new us mca the renegotiated nafta it gives america some rights against
[2:02:41.560 --> 2:02:47.160]  canada's proposed censorship because remember the censorship's aimed at guys like me but it's
[2:02:47.160 --> 2:02:51.320]  actually going to penalize the american business guys so get into that because earlier language
[2:02:51.320 --> 2:02:55.080]  they said oh gives immunity to big tech people like oh we don't want immunity i was like hey get
[2:02:55.080 --> 2:02:59.640]  rid of section 230 but actually the eu and canada's coming up for big tech we need section 230
[2:02:59.640 --> 2:03:08.040]  immunity so it's very sophisticated yeah article 19.17 to be precise of the us mca says that canada
[2:03:08.040 --> 2:03:16.440]  cannot uh hold liable american platforms for content now mexico has a three-year carve out
[2:03:16.440 --> 2:03:22.040]  because they're censoring to tackle child prostitution and pornography but that's
[2:03:22.040 --> 2:03:26.600]  illegal even under section 230 so you don't need that the mexicans have the carve out but not the
[2:03:26.600 --> 2:03:31.880]  canadian so one line of defense is donald trump saying hey justin truto thanks very little but
[2:03:31.880 --> 2:03:36.440]  we don't need your censorship of our american companies it's possible section 19.17 well yeah
[2:03:36.440 --> 2:03:41.560]  trump needs to stand up to the eu not on them trying to tax them that's bad enough but trying
[2:03:41.560 --> 2:03:47.080]  to impose their censorship rules yeah look i've always said it someone's gonna bust someone either
[2:03:47.080 --> 2:03:52.760]  donald trump busts like just like teddie roosevelt trust busts or either either donald trump busts the
[2:03:52.760 --> 2:03:58.840]  cartel or the cartel busts him and there's less than a year the countdown clock 320 days left in
[2:03:58.840 --> 2:04:02.680]  fact we're going to break but what is your smart guy i'm not just saying that he's a smart guy
[2:04:02.680 --> 2:04:07.800]  what do you think trump should do right now because we don't have time he's got to take action
[2:04:07.800 --> 2:04:14.520]  i think the only thing they're afraid of at google youtube twitter facebook is trust busting i don't
[2:04:14.520 --> 2:04:20.760]  think they care about fines i don't think they care about denunciations or hearings they're smarter
[2:04:20.760 --> 2:04:25.400]  than most of the congressman who grill them oh the only thing they scared of is what happened
[2:04:25.400 --> 2:04:31.720]  to standard oil busted up into seven pieces i think that's what scares google and nothing else
[2:04:31.720 --> 2:04:37.160]  i agree but that took years we need to move now and so as trump has said and this attorney general
[2:04:37.160 --> 2:04:41.320]  said there's a lot of stuff that's criminal they've done now he said the next few months in a statement
[2:04:41.320 --> 2:04:44.360]  last week they're going to be announcing what they're going to do on the trust front but he said
[2:04:44.360 --> 2:04:49.160]  but we've got other criminal things we're looking at other criminal areas there's more than one way
[2:04:49.160 --> 2:05:00.760]  to skin a cat we'll be back in 60 seconds the 12 days of christmas are almost over get your orders in

[2:06:25.720 --> 2:06:31.800]  we are back live broadcasting worldwide i'm your host alex jones as our event is here
[2:06:31.800 --> 2:06:37.960]  riding shotgun with us and boy i mean he knows his stuff is a businessman this this code that
[2:06:37.960 --> 2:06:41.560]  code i know a lot of this stuff and most of them and i'm like this guy's got a better memory than i
[2:06:41.560 --> 2:06:49.880]  do i want to go to phone calls with the impeachment because we can't not focus on that and i don't
[2:06:49.880 --> 2:06:54.680]  want to be overconfident we know it changes the subject it blocks up congress getting things done
[2:06:54.680 --> 2:07:01.160]  that you do it it feeds the radical base and i gut level know they always do the same thing
[2:07:01.160 --> 2:07:07.160]  these sociopaths they're they're very ocd they're very robotic they're gonna bring forward i think
[2:07:07.160 --> 2:07:10.760]  other scandals during the senate trial that obviously won't be heard in the trial but it'll
[2:07:10.760 --> 2:07:16.600]  be used as background to say oh see he's guilty he's bad they've done this to me uh in like a
[2:07:16.600 --> 2:07:20.360]  custody battle for my children a few years ago they had up to 50 members of the press you see
[2:07:20.360 --> 2:07:25.400]  about 20 in the week and a half trial in there just lying about me and what was being said to get
[2:07:25.400 --> 2:07:32.200]  it back to the jury and and so as above so below they i mean i'm just expecting curveballs what are
[2:07:32.200 --> 2:07:38.520]  you from a business perspective patriot perspective historical perspective what are you looking for
[2:07:38.520 --> 2:07:43.800]  or uh the curveballs they could throw you got to remember i'm based in canada so i look at this
[2:07:43.800 --> 2:07:49.720]  from an outsider's point of view and and i think that because i'm one degree removed maybe i got
[2:07:49.720 --> 2:07:55.480]  a little bit of perspective that if you're right in the battle and i think it looks like games it
[2:07:55.480 --> 2:08:00.360]  looks like gamesmanship i think that's why the polls are going down on it but you got it right
[2:08:00.360 --> 2:08:05.800]  you throw 50 unrelated smears at a man and something's going to stick what was the thing
[2:08:05.800 --> 2:08:11.880]  that's stuck on romney the the dog on the roof right or like it could be a weird quirky thing
[2:08:11.880 --> 2:08:15.560]  so if they're just throwing all this muck at him you never know what's going to stick in someone's
[2:08:15.560 --> 2:08:21.640]  mind i think though trump's negatives are already baked in what i mean by that is we already know
[2:08:21.640 --> 2:08:26.440]  everything about donald trump there's nothing new that's going to turn people against them we've
[2:08:26.440 --> 2:08:35.080]  known him for 20 years whereas we don't know the democrat presidential primary winner yet it could
[2:08:35.080 --> 2:08:41.640]  be some relative unknown i think that trump you're seeing as low as he can go i think his base is
[2:08:41.640 --> 2:08:48.680]  like 45 percent but i think if they if i think once we're through this impeachment and once the
[2:08:48.680 --> 2:08:54.200]  democrats narrow it down that's going to be the game who can brand and define the democrat candidate
[2:08:54.200 --> 2:08:58.440]  i don't know i'm speaking as a foreigner no i think i think the 35 000 foot view is a very
[2:08:58.440 --> 2:09:04.280]  clear view that's the same view i'm getting and so i asked the democrats themselves a lot of them
[2:09:04.280 --> 2:09:08.840]  are you know dottering and and and have dementia but the kind of special owners behind them are
[2:09:08.840 --> 2:09:14.280]  pretty smart and so i just look at the at the at the numbers and i just i guess they just can't
[2:09:14.280 --> 2:09:18.760]  help themselves and they're they think their base wants this and so they're giving their base what
[2:09:18.760 --> 2:09:23.480]  they want yeah well i mean the word impeachment i don't know if most people actually even know
[2:09:23.480 --> 2:09:30.280]  what it means it just sounds really bad like a like a crime in itself and i don't know i i think
[2:09:30.280 --> 2:09:35.320]  they couldn't tag him with color what is the definition of impeach it means to discredit
[2:09:35.320 --> 2:09:41.720]  it means to disparate it means to show that someone's testimony is flawed or inaccurate but what is
[2:09:41.720 --> 2:09:47.320]  impeachment in the legislative sense in removing a president i don't even i mean is that definition
[2:09:47.320 --> 2:09:53.080]  means handing down an indictment it means it's it begins the process of overturning someone
[2:09:53.960 --> 2:09:59.000]  or an election i mean i what is the definition of there it is impeach calling the question
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:03.560]  integrity or validity and so that's it they're just calling into question with this and creating
[2:10:03.560 --> 2:10:10.040]  the indictment there is no basis to that i think i think it's a it's a heavy form of censure or
[2:10:10.040 --> 2:10:15.800]  denunciation look trump's been dealing with that every single day this just adds a fancy word to
[2:10:15.800 --> 2:10:20.920]  it i don't know i think that it is backfiring against the dems because people say just like the
[2:10:20.920 --> 2:10:27.480]  brexit tricksters they're trying to avoid having the democracy choose so the globalists have to
[2:10:27.480 --> 2:10:33.960]  really be scared right now because their plans the that the attack on the family the open borders
[2:10:33.960 --> 2:10:39.000]  his lomification all of this is turning against them very quickly i mean they had everybody
[2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:44.040]  asleep and were just in total control 10 years ago and now they're in shambles let me give you
[2:10:44.040 --> 2:10:50.600]  an example it took donald trump a while to get going right and he just recently sent notice to
[2:10:50.600 --> 2:10:56.440]  the united nations that united states is formally withdrawing from the global warming scheme and
[2:10:56.440 --> 2:11:01.160]  that takes one year to take effect so about 12 months and you do that that's their that's the
[2:11:01.160 --> 2:11:06.200]  whole global government funding so by the time trump finishes his first term he'll have made a
[2:11:06.200 --> 2:11:11.960]  real dent in things a lot of judicial appointments a lot of good things rolling back the war on
[2:11:11.960 --> 2:11:17.720]  energy for example but if they can take them out in 2020 they can limit the damage but if
[2:11:17.720 --> 2:11:23.320]  trump wins again think of the judges think of the supreme court think of the other un conventions
[2:11:23.320 --> 2:11:27.640]  that trump can get out it'll be like an american brexit from the un think of all the things he's
[2:11:27.640 --> 2:11:33.560]  just started to do and he's supporting like-minded allies around the world like bolson arrow of
[2:11:33.560 --> 2:11:38.120]  brazil trump has allies around the world he wouldn't believe it if all you listen to is the
[2:11:38.120 --> 2:11:44.360]  mainstream media boy why is eastern europe so away well because they are the most recent people
[2:11:44.360 --> 2:11:49.160]  who have lived under authoritarian or totalitarian regimes i know a lot of people from the former
[2:11:49.160 --> 2:11:56.600]  soviet union it's too recent in their memory for them to have a bernie sanders or a oc a fantasy
[2:11:56.600 --> 2:12:00.840]  about what socialism is like and it's not even the economics is bad but that's not the worst of it
[2:12:00.840 --> 2:12:07.560]  the worst is the totalitarian surveillance state the informant state everyone ratting on everyone
[2:12:07.560 --> 2:12:12.440]  you know i i know some folks who left the soviet union in 79 they came to the west in that brief
[2:12:12.440 --> 2:12:17.640]  period of daytime and they told me that the people who got in trouble with the kgb the most often
[2:12:17.640 --> 2:12:22.600]  were not necessarily political dissidents those were pretty rare it was anyone who had a quirky
[2:12:22.600 --> 2:12:27.640]  personality anyone who was a bit much and they just got in trouble because they rubbed some boss
[2:12:27.640 --> 2:12:32.120]  the wrong way well that's that's what 1984 george arwell had been a you know commie
[2:12:32.120 --> 2:12:37.960]  controller as you know he he he he he points out that people would be disappeared by the
[2:12:37.960 --> 2:12:43.640]  secret police were just the funny quirky people or you slept with that girl and i wanted her
[2:12:43.640 --> 2:12:49.720]  and like personal feuds family exactly exactly like i mean i mean wow absolutely and then all
[2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:55.560]  information is controlled and here's the thing you could look around our society today and you
[2:12:55.560 --> 2:13:00.840]  can see individuals and even some people in congress i have to say and in our parliament in canada
[2:13:00.840 --> 2:13:07.000]  who if they were in an authoritarian or totalitarian regime they would thrive think of the people
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:11.640]  well look at how the left just runs around like this person said this take them down this person
[2:13:11.640 --> 2:13:16.280]  said that they're just reveling in things that just 20 years ago we knew was out of like some
[2:13:16.280 --> 2:13:24.280]  authoritarian nightmare that kgp kgb mindset is here with us we're not genetically superior to
[2:13:24.280 --> 2:13:29.960]  soviets or to nazis even we all have the same flaws in our personality and our morality if we
[2:13:29.960 --> 2:13:34.440]  can be manipulated by increment into that and let me tell you there would be people who would delight
[2:13:34.440 --> 2:13:40.120]  in a totalitarian regime there would be people who thrive and and we've got to be on guard because
[2:13:40.120 --> 2:13:43.880]  that risk is here in every generation well you've got to be on guard it's been it's happening again
[2:13:43.880 --> 2:13:51.080]  you would be in the gulag were you in the soviet union you're in a you're in a tech gulag you're
[2:13:51.080 --> 2:14:01.320]  in uh cyberia spelt cyb cyber cybers cyber i'll work on cyberberia but they haven't actually killed you
[2:14:02.120 --> 2:14:09.160]  but you but frankly i mean look here's one thing that i've been thinking about non-stop and i think
[2:14:09.160 --> 2:14:15.320]  the number one news event in 2019 i'm going to tell you my idea for what it is you tell me first
[2:14:15.320 --> 2:14:18.760]  and i'll tell you what i think what do you think the number one news story in 2019 is
[2:14:20.680 --> 2:14:24.200]  have you thought about it yet i mean the year's not over i mean i think it's this whole impeachment
[2:14:24.200 --> 2:14:30.440]  i i think it's trump brown in the wars i disagree with you i think it's jeffrey ebbstein
[2:14:30.440 --> 2:14:38.200]  all i murdered because it won't be below because whether you're left wing right wing liberal rich
[2:14:38.200 --> 2:14:47.480]  poor everybody knew that was bs except the media to this day most mainstream media say he
[2:14:48.040 --> 2:14:51.560]  committed no you're right and no one believes it sure sure if you're talking about delayed response
[2:14:51.560 --> 2:14:54.680]  you're totally right it's the biggest thing because it's when everybody came together and said
[2:14:54.680 --> 2:14:59.800]  we don't buy the establishment anymore we don't believe you it it really is that magic moment
[2:14:59.800 --> 2:15:04.200]  you know you're walking by a picket fence and you wonder what's behind that picket fence and one
[2:15:04.200 --> 2:15:11.560]  one slat is down and you glance quickly and you know what you didn't see and just for one second
[2:15:11.560 --> 2:15:15.800]  that one piece of that one plank from the picket fence came down and we saw things
[2:15:15.800 --> 2:15:20.360]  and don't tell me that's a conspiracy theory i mean you can tell me that but you've got to
[2:15:20.360 --> 2:15:24.760]  believe in a conspiracy theory to to be on the other side you've got the 35 000 foot view and
[2:15:24.760 --> 2:15:28.600]  you've also got the ground because you run a media company all over the world it's important as ours
[2:15:28.600 --> 2:15:34.840]  is and you're absolutely right because i get too close to it i i get maybe 10 percent of the attacks
[2:15:34.840 --> 2:15:39.480]  now on the street everywhere and way more support of people saying i was wrong about you you were
[2:15:39.480 --> 2:15:43.640]  right jeffrey ebbstein didn't kill himself the clinton's killed him they'll add you're right that's

[2:20:38.360 --> 2:20:43.880]  a louisiana representative had some powerful statements just a little while ago about this whole
[2:20:43.880 --> 2:20:49.720]  fiasco that's trying to tear our country apart here it is the democrats of all of a sudden become
[2:20:49.720 --> 2:20:56.360]  constitutionalist we're not being devoured from within because of some surreal assertion of the
[2:20:56.360 --> 2:21:03.320]  socialist newfound love for the very flag that they trod upon we face this horror because of this map
[2:21:04.120 --> 2:21:11.640]  this is what the democrats fear they fear the true will of we the people they are deep establishment
[2:21:11.640 --> 2:21:20.360]  dc they fear they call this republican map fly over country they call us deplorables they fear our
[2:21:20.360 --> 2:21:27.480]  faith they fear our strength they fear our unity they fear our vote and they fear our president

[2:22:00.680 --> 2:22:05.640]  merry christmas i think this weekend i'm gonna go with my kid up to snare starbucks wish everybody
[2:22:05.640 --> 2:22:10.520]  merry christmas see what happens i don't know turn about that story oh i don't mean to interrupt you
[2:22:10.520 --> 2:22:14.840]  but let me ask ezra about that people i heard 20 years ago there's a war on christmas i thought
[2:22:14.840 --> 2:22:20.360]  that's an exaggeration literally they're saying gorsuch is bad and i hate criminal for saying
[2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:27.560]  merry christmas uh on fox news i mean this is really happening yeah and when when they just
[2:22:27.560 --> 2:22:32.520]  say it it's one thing but when they start to enforce it by law in my country canada where
[2:22:32.520 --> 2:22:36.680]  we don't have the first amendment there was a street preacher who was arrested because he didn't
[2:22:36.680 --> 2:22:42.600]  have a busking license for talking about the gospel he needed a license we had him on oh he did
[2:22:42.600 --> 2:22:47.640]  hey black fella yeah yeah and i and i saw the police come and say you're arrested because you
[2:22:47.640 --> 2:22:53.640]  offended people and he was saying i love you in christ now and again folks i love other cultures i
[2:22:53.640 --> 2:22:57.880]  love other things i wouldn't go to china and they're in their fire lantern thing and tell them i'm
[2:22:57.880 --> 2:23:03.000]  offended by it or whatever or you know hanukkah take my daughter you know she's a christian but
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:08.120]  she chose the songs they had inquire for the whole school she liked the hanukkah song and so she
[2:23:08.120 --> 2:23:11.560]  actually won the contest out of like hundreds of kids and there's gonna be like four other kids
[2:23:11.560 --> 2:23:15.800]  singing it tonight i mean it's very offensive that you know she's saying it's pretty it's a beautiful
[2:23:15.800 --> 2:23:20.760]  song but i mean that's the the left doesn't care about other cultures they want to dominate them
[2:23:20.760 --> 2:23:27.640]  yeah you know i i think it's just a fact that uh the history of western civilization is the history
[2:23:27.640 --> 2:23:33.640]  of christianity you can go back further and throw judio christ judeo christian values in there too
[2:23:33.640 --> 2:23:37.480]  i mean i'm a jew myself but there's that is where christianity comes out of the old testament
[2:23:37.480 --> 2:23:44.120]  i mean that's that's the story of the west so when folks come to the west from other parts
[2:23:44.120 --> 2:23:47.960]  all right well i mean there's interest i mean and there's a lot of interesting things around the
[2:23:47.960 --> 2:23:54.520]  world but the essence of the west what made us strong and free comes rooted in that tradition
[2:23:54.520 --> 2:24:01.320]  and and to knock it down and to replace it with what because that's the thing nature abhors a vacuum
[2:24:01.320 --> 2:24:06.360]  and if you knock down the religion of christianity something else replace it you know what the
[2:24:06.360 --> 2:24:12.440]  and you know the answer what's the fastest growing religion in the west well that's good i was going
[2:24:12.440 --> 2:24:18.120]  to say environmentalism no well no you're right look at the new religion it's probably bigger
[2:24:18.120 --> 2:24:23.720]  than islam well you're right to say islam because they they have a firm and fiery belief in it and
[2:24:23.720 --> 2:24:29.080]  they wouldn't stop saying us a la malaykum because some politicians said so and i wouldn't i wouldn't
[2:24:29.080 --> 2:24:34.440]  get mad if the muslims are having a festival and i'm i'm offended by that unless it's the one where
[2:24:34.440 --> 2:24:38.440]  they the shiites beat themselves they have a knife well more to the point you wouldn't go to samalia
[2:24:38.440 --> 2:24:44.520]  or afghanistan or pakistan and tell them to undo de islamified their islamic control they kill me
[2:24:44.520 --> 2:24:52.680]  too yeah well and i don't know i think that when you purge a common set of values something else
[2:24:52.680 --> 2:24:56.280]  will replace it and that's the plan let's talk about that next time because i want to ask you why
[2:24:56.280 --> 2:25:00.280]  the left is allied with islam when it's i mean how you think they're going to navigate that
[2:25:00.280 --> 2:25:05.080]  justin sorry i apologize you you you triggered me with the merry christmas go ahead yeah no worries
[2:25:05.080 --> 2:25:09.320]  i was just talking about a story from you know i heard a caller calling yesterday saying that his
[2:25:09.320 --> 2:25:16.040]  body got fired from Starbucks for saying merry christmas to customers but anyway i think because
[2:25:16.040 --> 2:25:21.640]  of you i started looking like underground for information because you know the media is full
[2:25:21.640 --> 2:25:27.080]  of bs and you know i'm not one of the two and i hope numbers but i pay attention to some of it and i
[2:25:27.080 --> 2:25:33.240]  was wondering if when they keep saying like uh get your popcorn ready i'm wondering if this is
[2:25:33.240 --> 2:25:39.400]  what they were talking about that trope wanted for this to go to trial so then he could put these
[2:25:39.400 --> 2:25:45.640]  people in one ton of bowl or hangover to whatever they're gonna do uh because these sick monsters
[2:25:45.640 --> 2:25:50.520]  need to all well it's certainly gonna politically backfire on them i think the whole i'd love the
[2:25:50.520 --> 2:25:55.400]  qanon thing to be real but um that's a really good question thank you for the call justin
[2:25:55.400 --> 2:25:58.200]  that brings me into qanon i don't want to start fights with those folks a lot of good people
[2:25:58.200 --> 2:26:02.040]  believe in it but you know is it magically he's going to fix it and they're all going to go to a
[2:26:02.040 --> 2:26:08.440]  fema camp um i wouldn't want him to go to fema camps i want the globalist to have trials yeah you
[2:26:08.440 --> 2:26:14.680]  know i understand why people find q interesting because it's quirky and it's uh it's like a puzzle
[2:26:14.680 --> 2:26:21.560]  it's like uh it you know it's like a mystery but i you know what's the saying pray like it all
[2:26:21.560 --> 2:26:25.800]  depends depends on god work like it all depends on you i don't think you need trust in god but
[2:26:25.800 --> 2:26:30.920]  roll away from the rocks i yeah i i think q is a kind of mysticism you don't need it i mean the
[2:26:30.920 --> 2:26:35.960]  truth there's enough truth out there and there's enough problems out there to focus on that i i
[2:26:35.960 --> 2:26:40.440]  haven't gone that way absolutely and you know like i'll have people on that like founded delt divorce
[2:26:40.440 --> 2:26:45.240]  or high level cia or i talk to trump or you know constantly talking to roger stone and be like hey
[2:26:46.360 --> 2:26:51.480]  cue your buddy he knows everything he's above trump okay and it's just like and then the stuff
[2:26:51.480 --> 2:26:55.640]  doesn't happen and people are waiting for it to happen it happens when you hit the streets
[2:26:55.640 --> 2:26:59.720]  i think they're more scared of anything of not just having protests but going out and
[2:26:59.720 --> 2:27:04.680]  confronting joe biden confronting hillary not screaming at him but actually bringing up points
[2:27:04.680 --> 2:27:09.240]  have you seen the video of one of our listeners i just just he's up in the front row and just shuts
[2:27:09.240 --> 2:27:14.600]  biden down with the and brings up the whole energy question and the whole son of a bitch he got fired
[2:27:14.600 --> 2:27:19.160]  and no one else had done that no one on national news and it's just devastating yeah you know
[2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:25.160]  trump never gets an easy question uh democrats never get a hard question they're only used to
[2:27:25.160 --> 2:27:30.840]  playing defense so the first time you get a biden on defense and ilhan omer doesn't do well on
[2:27:30.840 --> 2:27:36.280]  defense aoc doesn't do well on defense and lucky for them most of the media party as i call it
[2:27:36.280 --> 2:27:40.360]  give us some of these that's why you never see them go on conservative shows or national shows
[2:27:40.360 --> 2:27:45.480]  they only go to the softballs that are rigged yeah i totally agree we don't have time to jam in one
[2:27:45.480 --> 2:27:49.640]  more i promise we're going to carlos uh we're going to go to who's uh that's from canada we're
[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:53.720]  going to go to jefferson and we're going to go to uh james we're going to go to calip first they
[2:27:53.720 --> 2:27:58.360]  went home the longest and joe we're going to get to everybody we got to move quick on the other side
[2:27:58.360 --> 2:28:03.800]  but um speaking of cultural appropriation i was just thinking of that you know inquire
[2:28:03.800 --> 2:28:08.920]  uh in a multi-school deal my daughter just they had like five or six songs i could choose from
[2:28:08.920 --> 2:28:15.240]  she chose that the left nowadays would say someone choosing a song that isn't quote from their group
[2:28:15.240 --> 2:28:20.040]  is cultural appropriation and that's not that at all people adopt cultures and things because
[2:28:20.040 --> 2:28:24.200]  they're interesting or they're pretty or they like them if i go eat mexican food it's not cultural
[2:28:24.200 --> 2:28:28.280]  appropriation that's a real attempt to segregate everybody well the fact that we're speaking english
[2:28:28.840 --> 2:28:33.720]  uh whoever speaks english are you appropriating british culture the fact that we're using
[2:28:33.720 --> 2:28:39.160]  arabic numerals no that's just what life is life is people meeting and exchanging ideas
[2:28:39.160 --> 2:28:44.440]  may the best ideas win i like chinese food that's not appropriations what i like exactly and and
[2:28:44.440 --> 2:28:49.880]  only a cult would tell you to feel bad about it it's crazy your calls are straight ahead with the
[2:28:49.880 --> 2:28:58.200]  head of rebel media attention gcn self-reliance listeners if you've ever wanted an emergency

[2:29:08.120 --> 2:29:12.840]  low prices on our ppx microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of
[2:29:12.840 --> 2:29:17.640]  electricity off the grid the clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here
[2:29:17.640 --> 2:29:21.720]  right on the east bank of the mississippi because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our
[2:29:21.720 --> 2:29:26.360]  inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd
[2:29:26.360 --> 2:29:30.680]  offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the flood
[2:29:30.680 --> 2:29:36.120]  waters backstory so here's what you should do right now check out the ppx microgrid system at my own

[2:34:20.520 --> 2:34:27.000]  your calls of savannah hernandez last night peacefully and she even uses an action seven
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:32.040]  uh mike so the left doesn't attack her if you have an info wars mike they'll literally try to kill
[2:34:32.040 --> 2:34:38.840]  you um and she's just talking to this woman who was talking to her first and the woman then assaults
[2:34:38.840 --> 2:34:43.960]  her and start you know runs into her starts hitting her knocks the mic and camera out of the camera
[2:34:43.960 --> 2:34:51.960]  person's face it's crazy and this is happening all over the country and all over the world
[2:34:51.960 --> 2:35:00.600]  here it is he's on audio tape saying he's on audio tape saying that he grabs people by the pussies
[2:35:01.240 --> 2:35:06.360]  grabs them by the pussy our president said that out loud and he said he said that while he was
[2:35:06.360 --> 2:35:12.200]  president it doesn't matter it doesn't matter that's the type of person that would say that
[2:35:13.320 --> 2:35:18.920]  like three inches further away from me i mean if you want to speak to me into the microphone i need
[2:35:18.920 --> 2:35:22.280]  to put it that close your face to hear it i don't want to speak to you in the microphone now why do
[2:35:22.280 --> 2:35:28.600]  you keep talking i have a really bad temper okay and also i'm still waiting for you to google the
[2:35:28.600 --> 2:35:41.960]  facts that you can't seem to find is there okay savannah hernandez is going to be on the war room
[2:35:41.960 --> 2:35:45.880]  talking about the rest of what happened owens but all over the country with the crew and the armored
[2:35:45.880 --> 2:35:50.920]  vehicle why'd we get it literally because it takes over all the headlines and our talking points get
[2:35:50.920 --> 2:35:56.840]  out and because they throw bottles at us you name we go up to the antifa and now they're they're so
[2:35:56.840 --> 2:36:02.040]  terroristic it really helps to be able to defend ourselves now i want to play somebody that said
[2:36:02.040 --> 2:36:07.880]  something that sounds great it's red meat but if the democrats blow up another federal building
[2:36:07.880 --> 2:36:12.760]  and blame it on us it's not going to be good so i don't want to be talking about offensive violence
[2:36:12.760 --> 2:36:18.040]  it's Minnesota republicans said second revolution will occur if guns taken away i want to get him
[2:36:18.040 --> 2:36:26.040]  on calls for opponents to be stomped cal bar said during a Minnesota gun owners caucus rally on
[2:36:26.040 --> 2:36:30.840]  saturday there's a lot of us in the room that had enough and it's time to start writing her
[2:36:30.840 --> 2:36:35.800]  and the rest of these people want to take your rights away from you they will not go quietly
[2:36:35.800 --> 2:36:41.320]  into the good night they need to be kicked to the curb and stomped on and run over a few times
[2:36:41.320 --> 2:36:46.200]  he added drawing cheers from the crowd we don't want to join eyes to start running people over
[2:36:46.200 --> 2:36:50.200]  now i know the less we're calling for violence and all this but they're going to ignore what they
[2:36:50.200 --> 2:36:54.520]  said if any of this happens and blame it on everybody and so we already have an antifa
[2:36:54.520 --> 2:36:58.280]  attacking people in ohio and killing folks at a nightclub they blamed it on trump supporters so
[2:36:59.080 --> 2:37:04.360]  we need to be the ones that don't shoot first we get into a shooting war we failed we're winning
[2:37:04.360 --> 2:37:12.840]  we're winning intellectually here's what he had to say it's red meat everybody loves it but we do not
[2:37:12.840 --> 2:37:17.400]  want to kick off the physical confrontation hey i know patrick henry said the war's already begun
[2:37:17.400 --> 2:37:24.840]  let's get it on that was before governments could pull off really good false flags okay so again if
[2:37:24.840 --> 2:37:29.000]  they come for the guns and virginian stuff don't worry it's gonna kick off again just like in 1776
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:33.160]  so all the people talking about violence you're gonna get your chance but let's try to work not
[2:37:33.160 --> 2:37:37.240]  to have that happen here it is some days you know you feel like the boiling frog the frog in the
[2:37:37.240 --> 2:37:42.440]  boiling water just exactly how long are they gonna just keep notching it up a degree here and a degree
[2:37:42.440 --> 2:37:48.120]  here and a degree here until you've had enough that line is for each of us to decide they each on
[2:37:48.120 --> 2:37:54.040]  our own terms there you go there's a lot of us in this room that have had enough and it's time to
[2:37:54.040 --> 2:37:57.880]  start riding herd on the rest of them the rest of these people that want to take your rights away
[2:37:57.880 --> 2:38:03.000]  from you they will not go quietly into the good night they need to be kicked to the curb and
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:09.800]  stomped on and run over a few times now i i think the guy's a good guy i want to get him on because
[2:38:09.800 --> 2:38:15.320]  he said in the context of it but the media won't go with that that they're stomping on our rights
[2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:20.920]  they're running over us so it was metaphorical he just needs to clarify that because well i mean
[2:38:20.920 --> 2:38:27.960]  as or what do you think i gotta tell you alex i'm sorry i am so distracted by the attack on savannah
[2:38:27.960 --> 2:38:34.040]  hernandez there i saw that clip i didn't know that was one of your people oh yeah and i i was i was
[2:38:34.040 --> 2:38:39.080]  listening uh out of the side of my ear to what else you were saying since then but i am so deeply
[2:38:39.080 --> 2:38:46.600]  disturbed by that and i think that that young reporter there who if anything is too polite being
[2:38:46.600 --> 2:38:53.320]  attacked anti-fist style i find that deeply troubling and in the full clip they start talking to her i
[2:38:53.320 --> 2:38:57.880]  and then and then and then he talked and then and then the mic's like six inches away she's not being
[2:38:57.880 --> 2:39:03.720]  rude at all what even if she was rude you don't respond to rudeness by pushing a woman down that's
[2:39:03.720 --> 2:39:09.160]  a salt and battery now and this i don't want to get into your business here maybe you've got some
[2:39:09.160 --> 2:39:13.800]  plan but is there a report to police is there a civil action oh yeah we've had people charged and
[2:39:13.800 --> 2:39:18.200]  convicted for attacking our reporters absolutely because hey can we get savannah hernandez in here
[2:39:18.200 --> 2:39:24.680]  on the microphone or maybe you want in there i am just so i am so upset by that and that's
[2:39:24.680 --> 2:39:28.840]  well that's why she wants to go out with an info wars mic and he had security out there too they
[2:39:28.840 --> 2:39:32.920]  did it right i mean that's what's going on security because they all hate him if that's what happens
[2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:39.240]  when someone just has an a7 microphone imagine what would happen or if it said info wars it she'd
[2:39:39.240 --> 2:39:44.920]  get she'd get injured she'd get wounded i this is outrageous and and you know we were talking
[2:39:44.920 --> 2:39:48.600]  earlier what would happen to you if you were actually in the sovi union well that's the least
[2:39:48.600 --> 2:39:53.160]  of it that's another clip here but i promised to go to calls video info warrior attack let's play
[2:39:53.160 --> 2:40:00.440]  this with audio by libs these are really fascist for being at a la trump impeachment rally i mean
[2:40:00.440 --> 2:40:15.240]  he was there and this is what happened to him info wars listener and for stickers
[2:40:15.240 --> 2:40:33.080]  you they surrounding push him up against the wall start trying to take his bullhorn away if you're radio
[2:40:33.080 --> 2:40:41.480]  and they try to stop the speech and surrounding and start ripping the cord out of his let me get
[2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:48.120]  the skyline and now once he starts trying to leave the attack now they hit him in the head
[2:40:54.200 --> 2:40:57.640]  and they've broken it by pulling the cord out it's just broken on the siren right now
[2:40:57.640 --> 2:41:14.200]  i mean democrats are just crazed unamerican thugs though you know i think there's a
[2:41:14.200 --> 2:41:18.680]  qualitative difference between the two instances this fella here is right up in their grill
[2:41:18.680 --> 2:41:23.080]  with the megaphone and i'm not saying that they should punch him and damage his stuff
[2:41:23.080 --> 2:41:30.760]  but that young lady savannah ranandez was not in any way offensive she's a lady and really sweet
[2:41:30.760 --> 2:41:35.640]  lady smart and here's you know what the rule of law means alex it means no one's above the law
[2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:42.120]  but it also means no one's below the law and that means there are some people out there who the
[2:41:42.120 --> 2:41:46.120]  establishment says oh it doesn't matter if they get punched by the way guys where is savannah oh
[2:41:46.120 --> 2:41:50.760]  we've got her i don't mean to obsess on the subject i'm just so upset because they didn't even know
[2:41:50.760 --> 2:41:56.040]  she was in for war she was just someone who dared to say something modestly defensive
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:42:01.880]  about the president and she's put and you know let's do it this way because the lights are all
[2:42:01.880 --> 2:42:06.360]  crazy there she can just go over here on the corner in the side give her give her give her a mobile
[2:42:06.360 --> 2:42:10.760]  mic and and just we'll go to break we'll handle this because i built these studios so they can
[2:42:10.760 --> 2:42:14.840]  do shoots in them oh yeah and i don't know well i didn't mean to like to take things oh no no no
[2:42:14.840 --> 2:42:19.240]  the colors i gotta tell you and if i gotta be late at night or day it's okay because we'll go
[2:42:19.240 --> 2:42:23.160]  over that i'm gonna get to these calls before i go off and i would say that i better stop talking no
[2:42:23.160 --> 2:42:27.480]  no no no no no this is important so we're gonna we're gonna get this set up we're gonna bring
[2:42:27.480 --> 2:42:31.640]  savannah and i bet you could do a crowdfund set up a legal defense fund and hire a lawyer and sue
[2:42:31.640 --> 2:42:38.280]  the hell out of that that which absolutely you know what i'd i'd say our reporters get pushed
[2:42:38.280 --> 2:42:42.600]  sometimes punched and you know what the left they go after the women reporters even more than the men
[2:42:42.600 --> 2:42:45.720]  because there's a coward there's a coward oh i've noticed they attack people in wheelchairs at

[2:49:04.120 --> 2:49:08.920]  came and asked me if i was okay i said yes i'm all right police press charges like oan did the
[2:49:08.920 --> 2:49:12.760]  lady that sexually assaulted him she was found guilty in dc yeah a lot of people on twitter
[2:49:12.760 --> 2:49:17.240]  man they need to learn they can't even get a buck knock your head open right and the thing too is in
[2:49:17.240 --> 2:49:20.760]  that video i don't know if you see it but she actually pushed me off a ledge that's probably about
[2:49:20.760 --> 2:49:27.000]  as i mean like this desk she like pushed and then i see the camera get what happened there so my
[2:49:28.440 --> 2:49:34.440]  microphone is attached with the cord to the to the phone with the camera and so when she pushed me
[2:49:34.440 --> 2:49:41.000]  my camera woman went with her and again too you can see in the video um two men were following me
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:45.160]  around all night long and they were talking to the people that i was interviewing they were saying
[2:49:45.160 --> 2:49:48.840]  oh she's misleading people with questions and it's really funny elix because i was interviewing

[2:50:24.520 --> 2:50:29.320]  when they get assaulted we raised 50 grand i literally have to pay for four security guys
[2:50:29.320 --> 2:50:34.760]  to go with with with uh oh and we have to confront them we go out on hundreds of cameras it gets the
[2:50:34.760 --> 2:50:38.920]  news out we counter them we counter their narrative it's like having an impeachment in the house
[2:50:38.920 --> 2:50:43.240]  where republicans can't speak if we don't go out and do this they're the only ones on the media
[2:50:43.240 --> 2:50:48.520]  we're having a huge effect for you and for ourselves and for freedom but that's why we need to sell

[2:51:34.600 --> 2:51:38.440]  basically saying that yeah two grown men were basically following me around all night and harassing
[2:51:38.440 --> 2:51:43.640]  me telling people that i was misleading them with questions next time that happens you call tim we
[2:51:43.640 --> 2:51:50.680]  had literally like like like five guys out there okay because there's one just four who have like
[2:51:50.680 --> 2:51:54.520]  best military records there are okay special operations everything they would have come
[2:51:54.520 --> 2:51:58.920]  right over there and and not you know and and protected you so you need to have those guys
[2:51:58.920 --> 2:52:03.880]  a number on they were out there yeah okay so i they need to be with you i mean i did fall right
[2:52:03.880 --> 2:52:08.040]  in front of them but again they were surrounding oan oan was surrounded by police it was hard for
[2:52:08.040 --> 2:52:12.200]  them to get on my side to come and protect me as well because as soon as i got attacked of course
[2:52:12.200 --> 2:52:17.240]  it was like a mob of people started coming up and shoulder checking me and like attacking me more
[2:52:17.240 --> 2:52:21.400]  because i got attacked and i was like what is going on here they're like maranas they're so
[2:52:21.400 --> 2:52:25.960]  exactly they all went and they were like uh you're putting things in my face this grown man like as
[2:52:25.960 --> 2:52:30.120]  big as you alex like came to shoulder checked me he said excuse me and then shoulder check okay that's
[2:52:30.120 --> 2:52:34.520]  why i'm not like a tough guy but if i saw that i'd tear the dude's head off good so it was it was a
[2:52:34.520 --> 2:52:38.920]  lot to do the anezer i'm sorry i didn't mean to cut you off no no i'm just so mad because we've
[2:52:38.920 --> 2:52:45.320]  experienced this at the hands of antifa too it's like the twitter mob made into flesh and the thing
[2:52:45.320 --> 2:52:50.040]  is no one has ever told them it's wrong listen i'm i'm a visitor down here i've been drawing your
[2:52:50.040 --> 2:52:56.280]  company it's nice to meet you i'm not here to give advice to how to do things but my god i think i know
[2:52:56.280 --> 2:53:01.960]  that your people when they see what happened to your reporter who who was so inoffensive you were
[2:53:01.960 --> 2:53:07.480]  very gentle out there i mean you weren't meek you were you were very polite and you were pushed
[2:53:07.480 --> 2:53:12.600]  i think we need a specific deterrent against that particular woman she was pushed off a curve a
[2:53:12.600 --> 2:53:18.200]  general deterrent against anyone else it's about your self-respect as a person and it's about the
[2:53:18.200 --> 2:53:26.120]  respect you cannot denormalize a reporter just because she is well there's still time to press
[2:53:26.120 --> 2:53:30.840]  charges oh i think you must let me do this i don't have a lot of money but five thousand
[2:53:30.840 --> 2:53:37.720]  dollar reward leading to the identification and the arrest of that lady five thousand dollar reward
[2:53:37.720 --> 2:53:43.000]  savannah give me your email address i'm sorry give folks your email address just because so they
[2:53:43.000 --> 2:53:48.200]  can send you her identity you know what how about this alex my dms are open on twitter so go on
[2:53:48.200 --> 2:53:53.800]  twitter and we'll do it that way instead um because that'll be i think the best way do you want her
[2:53:53.800 --> 2:53:59.080]  indicted yes i you know i i didn't want to press charges but again you're gonna do it to somebody
[2:53:59.080 --> 2:54:02.440]  else exactly she's gonna do it to somebody else and we do need to stand up to these people and say
[2:54:02.440 --> 2:54:07.000]  hey it's not okay to push me alex i've talked about it a lot i don't go and try to debate people
[2:54:07.000 --> 2:54:13.000]  and make people angry what i want to do is educate people about okay if there's a trump rape
[2:54:13.000 --> 2:54:16.360]  allegation let's look it up on google together and that was that whole entire video the full
[2:54:16.360 --> 2:54:20.200]  four minutes is on my youtube the whole reason i'm standing there is because i'm waiting for her to
[2:54:20.200 --> 2:54:25.240]  find on google who trump raped and she couldn't find it and that's when i said hey i'm still waiting
[2:54:25.240 --> 2:54:29.080]  for those facts that you can't seem to find she got upset and she pushed me off the ledge
[2:54:29.080 --> 2:54:33.480]  because she couldn't find the yeah you need to put out a whole another one again basically saying
[2:54:34.200 --> 2:54:39.960]  female reporter assaulted for uh female reporter assaulted for saying trump did not rape women and
[2:54:39.960 --> 2:54:43.320]  the president needs to stand up for you as he's done before let me ask you this if the shoe was on
[2:54:43.320 --> 2:54:48.600]  the other foot if an info wars reporter had pushed a liberal down to be national news to be national
[2:54:48.600 --> 2:54:55.320]  news charges would be laid the splc and the adl would be involved it would be on brian stelter's
[2:54:55.320 --> 2:55:02.040]  media review and you would be facing charges and the thing is rule of law you are no better and no
[2:55:02.040 --> 2:55:08.920]  worse than anyone else in the eyes of the law i believe you have to stand up to that thug i know
[2:55:08.920 --> 2:55:13.480]  she's a young woman as well i just know criminal but let me tell you my favorite part about this
[2:55:13.480 --> 2:55:18.840]  man is very truthful she never exaggerates men big men were shoulder checking her she's a little
[2:55:18.840 --> 2:55:24.680]  lady i let me tell you something scumbags my god i'm pissed out alex let me tell you my favorite
[2:55:24.680 --> 2:55:29.080]  part about this video so she pushes me as you can also clearly see and as she's pushing me i'm still
[2:55:29.080 --> 2:55:33.640]  not pushing back and then as soon as i grabbed her because i was falling off the ledge she goes
[2:55:33.640 --> 2:55:39.080]  i'm pregnant and i it just made me laugh so hard because i'm like you're attacking me man oh my god
[2:55:39.080 --> 2:55:44.760]  and now these people are professional victims now it was insane and then she even tried to go up to
[2:55:44.760 --> 2:55:50.360]  the police and say she's attacking me and gabby my camera woman was like uh i had it on film what
[2:55:50.360 --> 2:55:54.760]  happened and everyone on twitter can see it too no one can dispute what happened and again too i'm

[2:56:28.360 --> 2:56:32.600]  the folks go out uh and you know i've had other things happen i can't get into an air sometimes
[2:56:32.600 --> 2:56:37.080]  i gotta be at my house with what the antifa does same stuff tucker carlson type stuff i'm not gonna
[2:56:37.080 --> 2:56:42.360]  get into it on air but infowarstore.com this is a real war we need to stay on air we're trying
[2:56:42.360 --> 2:56:46.520]  to hire more reporters now and we're trying to have at least four person teams that go out
[2:56:46.520 --> 2:56:50.760]  so that we can have other camera angles with the security guys and we're having to up the security
[2:56:50.760 --> 2:56:56.280]  here because it's going to be crazy with 320 days left infowarstore.com 12 days of christmas show

[2:58:20.440 --> 2:58:25.000]  of the most hardened criminals from around the world they've tried to poison us with fluoride

[3:00:22.600 --> 3:00:26.600]  tommy wouldn't even have been on the air the last few years one for this guy so ezra is a man of
[3:00:26.600 --> 3:00:31.800]  action over in the rebel media uh who's been holding the longest is it joe is it uh yes it is
[3:00:31.800 --> 3:00:38.520]  joe that it's lee and others uh joe in minnesota thanks for holding welcome hey how you doing
[3:00:38.520 --> 3:00:41.480]  good brother very thank you for holding what do you think about the whole impeachment
[3:00:42.680 --> 3:00:46.840]  well i think he might be uh i think it might be pulling a little bit of wool over his head
[3:00:46.840 --> 3:00:50.680]  i heard this morning that there's two omnibus bills that he's going to be signing tonight
[3:00:50.680 --> 3:00:57.240]  and in one of them it basically says that so if you're currently an illegal citizen in the
[3:00:57.240 --> 3:01:04.360]  united states right now and you go pick up a so-called refugee uh that person cannot be deported
[3:01:05.080 --> 3:01:12.120]  not the refugee but actually the person who is picking them up really yeah so i don't know if
[3:01:12.120 --> 3:01:16.520]  you can pass it out that's a good point what are they legislatively passing while we're distracted
[3:01:16.520 --> 3:01:22.840]  with the impeachment uh yeah that's that's that's a big thing you know and actually
[3:01:22.840 --> 3:01:29.240]  i don't know if you're also aware uh of the uh the he just passed or he says he just passed he
[3:01:29.240 --> 3:01:35.720]  just signed an executive order but uh just this week about protecting a certain class of people
[3:01:36.440 --> 3:01:43.720]  and if you look up hr 672 paragraphs c it says you can't even accuse these people of actual real
[3:01:43.720 --> 3:01:52.280]  events okay you're talking about how the left is with ilan omarnat is absolutely uh just obsessed
[3:01:52.280 --> 3:01:56.280]  with jews and israel on the universities i mean i mean they think everybody is involved in something
[3:01:56.280 --> 3:02:00.200]  everything and so all the other leftist groups are protected and all these other groups protected
[3:02:00.200 --> 3:02:04.360]  but then jews aren't protected so if you're gonna have this thing going on at the campuses
[3:02:05.080 --> 3:02:09.320]  i mean i've seen what trump's doing with that executive order and i've seen those interpretations
[3:02:09.320 --> 3:02:15.400]  uh of that law and i look i don't like the atl going up to free speech i don't like uh that being
[3:02:15.400 --> 3:02:19.720]  used by the left to take everybody's rights esrit what do you think about that it's a tough one
[3:02:19.720 --> 3:02:25.160]  because free speech is the gift you have to give to your opponents if you want it for yourself
[3:02:25.960 --> 3:02:30.680]  and it's tough it's tough to hear people say conservatives don't have speech christians
[3:02:30.680 --> 3:02:35.720]  get attacked i mean it it's it's it's it's it's open it's really trendy to hate jews on college
[3:02:35.720 --> 3:02:41.240]  campuses oh it it's terrible and the thing is it moves from just words to physical violence
[3:02:41.240 --> 3:02:45.480]  i say this there's a phrase out there wartime conservative versus peacetime conservative
[3:02:45.480 --> 3:02:48.920]  that's the difference between a donald trump and a mitt romney and sometimes if you're not
[3:02:48.920 --> 3:02:54.760]  punching at the antifa i don't mean that physically so i mean being crystal clear it's like what we
[3:02:54.760 --> 3:03:02.120]  talked about with savannah she gets pushed she says oh well no no no no no don't punch back but
[3:03:02.120 --> 3:03:06.920]  litigate prosecute sure but going back to that point is that i read the order and i read what it
[3:03:06.920 --> 3:03:11.560]  says and if it ever gets interpreted where somebody you know can't say any specific stuff that's
[3:03:11.560 --> 3:03:15.960]  their right to do it i'll i'll be against it but what i think it's saying is those schools can't
[3:03:15.960 --> 3:03:21.080]  sit there and basically run people out of there because they're jewish right well i mean again
[3:03:21.080 --> 3:03:26.440]  you put in the analogy of black or asian or whatever and they wouldn't allow a clan rally
[3:03:26.440 --> 3:03:33.720]  at a university right yeah uh now listen i'm i'm a pretty far down the road free speech absolute
[3:03:33.720 --> 3:03:38.360]  is because i know that they take that what that's the strategic freedom upon which all the others
[3:03:38.360 --> 3:03:42.920]  are built and you suffered that more than most so i i'm slow to deep platform somewhere else
[3:03:42.920 --> 3:03:48.200]  but there's a difference between words and deeds well i think trump is you're being called anti-semitic
[3:03:48.200 --> 3:03:52.520]  all this made up crap so he's like trying to show the left hey look look i'm also using
[3:03:52.520 --> 3:03:57.720]  the laws that already apply for everybody else on the colleges the colleges have turned to anti-free
[3:03:57.720 --> 3:04:03.800]  speech groups and again with the left there really is an obsession with israel look at sink
[3:04:03.800 --> 3:04:08.360]  uger of the young turds he said the way to handle israel is a bulldozer yeah i mean i mean why would
[3:04:08.360 --> 3:04:13.480]  you want to bulldoze israel i mean again the and somebody right wingers joining this in this hatred
[3:04:13.480 --> 3:04:19.400]  of israel thing like israel's one monolithic thing and it's very dangerous you know will chamberlain
[3:04:19.400 --> 3:04:25.640]  says uh sees the endowments what's he's saying these big universities with their multi-billion
[3:04:25.640 --> 3:04:31.560]  dollar endowments i'm i'm not for expropriation but that's a fun rhetorical rebuttal to leftists who
[3:04:31.560 --> 3:04:35.560]  say go after the capitalist billionaires well let's start with those big universities well i
[3:04:35.560 --> 3:04:41.560]  totally agree and and i'm glad i'm calling about that it was a good point a good debate but trumps
[3:04:41.560 --> 3:04:46.440]  right with his executive order saying we'll take the university's funding if you don't allow free
[3:04:46.440 --> 3:04:50.920]  speech so this this other direction uh you know trumps not perfect well we'll see what actually
[3:04:50.920 --> 3:05:00.040]  happens with this the 12 days of christmas are almost over get your orders in by december 20th
[3:05:00.040 --> 3:05:06.040]  and your guaranteed delivery before christmas anywhere in the united states by info or store

[3:05:48.040 --> 3:06:01.960]  win take action now info or store dot com you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow
[3:06:01.960 --> 3:06:09.640]  you know the last caller said trump's pulling the wool over her eyes with this impeachment
[3:06:10.520 --> 3:06:16.280]  the democrats really hate trump i mean this is real now i think it's backfiring on them but
[3:06:16.280 --> 3:06:23.720]  that's not a conspiracy um that's that the democrats want power you know i mean trump's not behind
[3:06:23.720 --> 3:06:29.160]  this impeachment no i know that's too complicated ockham's razor usually the simplest explanation
[3:06:29.160 --> 3:06:35.720]  is the right one that's too tricky this ain't 4d chess this is trump arrangement syndrome plus
[3:06:35.720 --> 3:06:42.440]  the squad pressuring Pelosi plus the truth is this will put an asterisk next to trump's name for
[3:06:42.440 --> 3:06:47.640]  all time he was impeached now that doesn't actually mean a lot but it's a smear and low
[3:06:47.640 --> 3:06:51.960]  information voters will say oh he was impeached that's that's the explanation here it's not
[3:06:51.960 --> 3:06:55.960]  quadruple tricky well i don't want to get off on the israel thing it's a tar baby but
[3:06:55.960 --> 3:07:00.920]  but big and around universities being around the left they literally call everyone nazis yeah
[3:07:00.920 --> 3:07:06.680]  constantly like parents and then jews are the most evil thing on the planet we need to blow
[3:07:06.680 --> 3:07:12.120]  israel up bulldoze it and it's just these people are the closest thing to nazis i see in the modern
[3:07:12.120 --> 3:07:17.640]  world antifa is the most fascist thing i see in the modern world well and they use the tactics of
[3:07:17.640 --> 3:07:21.800]  the brown shirts now they're black they call it the black block they have the you know the look
[3:07:21.800 --> 3:07:27.240]  the feel the style they are the paramilitaries of the left you know here's what worries me about
[3:07:27.240 --> 3:07:33.000]  calling trump a nazi i think most people know it's hyperbole but you got 300 plus million americans
[3:07:33.000 --> 3:07:39.000]  what if one in a million people actually what happens if trump gets assassinated well that's
[3:07:39.000 --> 3:07:44.120]  the thing you you search on twitter any given moment assassinate trump you'll find a hundred
[3:07:44.120 --> 3:07:48.200]  examples someone might have a screw loose someone say i'm gonna be famous someone might
[3:07:48.200 --> 3:07:52.680]  actually truly believe and we talked before about that you know that hypothetical mental
[3:07:53.800 --> 3:07:58.440]  game of imagination if you could go back in time would you kill baby hitler what if one in a million
[3:07:58.440 --> 3:08:03.320]  people said oh my god we actually have i had it's way more than that they had that guy during the
[3:08:03.320 --> 3:08:07.320]  last campaign it's probably got in with a gun to the event they barely stopped him it's probably
[3:08:07.320 --> 3:08:12.120]  one in 10 000 people maybe one in a thousand let me tell you they're willing to in front of police
[3:08:12.120 --> 3:08:17.560]  throw bottles at us hard and attack women it's it's well that's the thing it's you know that
[3:08:17.560 --> 3:08:22.840]  you know the broken windows theory of law and order you gotta if you if you let you let a little
[3:08:22.840 --> 3:08:29.560]  bit of chronic growth because you normalize it and that's why savannah hernandez is not just a
[3:08:29.560 --> 3:08:34.280]  trifle because if that's okay well then maybe it's a you don't have to tell me i'm pissed yeah well
[3:08:34.280 --> 3:08:40.440]  i am pissed right now i mean i i'm and i think it's about self-respect and it's about reteaching
[3:08:40.440 --> 3:08:47.000]  the rule of law and and social but as a fundamental level the fact that the police didn't do anything
[3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:50.840]  regardless if she wanted to press charges or not that's their job i don't know what they saw but
[3:08:50.840 --> 3:08:55.000]  but what i know what we saw and we got to bring that to the attention of call but here's the thing
[3:08:55.000 --> 3:09:00.440]  about using the word nazi and if i can speak to this for a minute as a jew you know i know what
[3:09:00.440 --> 3:09:07.240]  nazism is i know what the holocaust is and if trump's a nazi you're saying that hitler and trump are
[3:09:07.240 --> 3:09:14.120]  the same well trump's not that bad so that means if trump is no better than hitler hitler is no
[3:09:14.120 --> 3:09:19.000]  worse than trump your water's down the term it does and where's the defamation league where's the
[3:09:19.560 --> 3:09:24.760]  and frank center where's the holocaust museum saying whoa you can't well they're all just left
[3:09:24.760 --> 3:09:31.240]  us now saying well the doors is long well the head of the adl used to be a senior obama staffer and
[3:09:31.240 --> 3:09:37.000]  they move straight in the anti-defamation league and you'll notice how gentle he is with democrats
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:43.880]  and he really doesn't object to calling republicans nazi nazis i think he is undoing the jewish
[3:09:43.880 --> 3:09:51.560]  people by letting the left turn that world oh there's no there's no doubt that that he literally
[3:09:52.280 --> 3:09:56.200]  i've gone i've gone and read but i've seen his pages he's like islam's wonderful our friends
[3:09:56.200 --> 3:10:01.640]  oh they're so good we love you and then anyone criticizing the squad and people he'll come out
[3:10:01.640 --> 3:10:06.920]  and attack them so my this guy's bad news now let's go to jefferson in virginia where they're
[3:10:06.920 --> 3:10:11.640]  trying to do gun registration and confiscation they're openly talking about ordering the military
[3:10:11.640 --> 3:10:16.200]  to take the guns the military had to respond and say we're not doing that uh wow that's that's
[3:10:16.200 --> 3:10:22.680]  that's america december 2019 jefferson thanks for holding go ahead gentlemen what a great show thank
[3:10:22.680 --> 3:10:28.040]  you mr cover it's almost overwhelming uh my thought is uh when it comes to the senate we
[3:10:28.040 --> 3:10:32.760]  got to watch out here there's eight republican senators we can't trust and the number in the
[3:10:32.760 --> 3:10:39.720]  senate is not 67 okay they don't have to get to 67 to uh convict him it depends on how many senators
[3:10:39.720 --> 3:10:44.680]  are present when they hold the vote in the uh conviction phase and that's why they want to
[3:10:44.680 --> 3:10:50.600]  run it out through christmas and and and exactly they've done it before right so so the number could
[3:10:50.600 --> 3:10:55.480]  be as low as 47 could actually convict him a quorum they might convict him with 55 if eight
[3:10:55.480 --> 3:11:00.520]  republicans vote with the democrats so we got to be on the watch for how many republicans are
[3:11:00.520 --> 3:11:04.520]  actually physically in the senate when they get done with this silly trial when it comes to witnesses
[3:11:04.520 --> 3:11:09.240]  i don't want the witnesses called in the trial i want i want lindsay grand to step up in the
[3:11:09.240 --> 3:11:16.520]  judiciary judiciary committee and and call witnesses in a hearing you found uh yeah they went to
[3:11:16.520 --> 3:11:20.760]  music a little early sir go ahead and continue we're having some computer problems today but please
[3:11:20.760 --> 3:11:25.160]  continue but when it comes to the calling witnesses that's a double edged sword where we could get
[3:11:25.160 --> 3:11:30.040]  hurt too by the eight republicans they could vote with the uh democrats and call witnesses that we
[3:11:30.040 --> 3:11:35.160]  can't stop from them calling and then not help us get our witnesses on so that's a that's a quagmire
[3:11:35.160 --> 3:11:40.440]  we don't need we just want to put the impeachment trial behind us get through it and then have lindsay
[3:11:40.440 --> 3:11:45.240]  graham essentially call witnesses in a judiciary hearing on this whole comey and what is the
[3:11:45.240 --> 3:11:50.120]  punishment for the democrats in this fiasco not being reelected i mean it's only gonna encourage
[3:11:50.120 --> 3:11:55.720]  them to have a new hoax russia gate now the impeachment you know the the racism gate that just
[3:11:55.720 --> 3:12:04.840]  uh asra well we saw in brexit people who tried to meddle with the democratic result while the
[3:12:04.840 --> 3:12:10.040]  the labor party had its worst result in a century and if the democrats come across to
[3:12:10.600 --> 3:12:14.840]  to severely normal voters i'm talking about middle of the road independent mind of voters
[3:12:14.840 --> 3:12:21.080]  as wanting to have rigged the election in their own way by removing trump not through an election
[3:12:21.080 --> 3:12:27.640]  but through some shenanigans they may get the lash of the voters in november the same way jeremy
[3:12:27.640 --> 3:12:33.080]  corbin did i don't know listen this is something that as a canadian i'm not deeply immersed in the
[3:12:33.080 --> 3:12:37.560]  nuances of value but no more than i do a lot of subjects thank you jefferson another really smart
[3:12:37.560 --> 3:12:43.400]  caller as well thank you sir okay uh calib's been holding a really long time thank you calib you're

[3:13:12.360 --> 3:13:19.000]  the editors i'm very proud of the enforce operation i completely agree with you i think owens started
[3:13:19.000 --> 3:13:27.240]  a tidal wave last week um i saw the video of savannah this morning and you just feel absolutely
[3:13:27.240 --> 3:13:32.360]  helpless watching it and uh you know i feel like i want to beat the living snot out of some people
[3:13:32.360 --> 3:13:38.120]  i mean i'm being honest here i mean i'm getting pissed uh that lady she doesn't know what a bad
[3:13:38.120 --> 3:13:45.320]  temper is she's never seen a bad temper um well i'm talking about the men i savannah is is tough
[3:13:45.320 --> 3:13:51.160]  she doesn't whine and now she starts telling me men were elbow checking her i guarantee i see some
[3:13:51.160 --> 3:13:55.640]  man hitting one of my female reporters i'm gonna jump on them and they're gonna they're gonna know
[3:13:55.640 --> 3:14:01.560]  a temper i'm getting sick of these people man they need the fear of god in them yeah i mean
[3:14:01.560 --> 3:14:06.680]  there's a there's a whole army listening right now that you know they would they would all be
[3:14:06.680 --> 3:14:11.240]  standing right behind her so well we're gonna have to create the informers posse that's legal
[3:14:11.240 --> 3:14:15.800]  and lawful but just folks that come out to events when this happens because like like you said has
[3:14:15.800 --> 3:14:20.360]  run they target women and people in wheelchairs and crutches and little kids yeah it's the male
[3:14:20.360 --> 3:14:25.160]  feminist there the worst all antifa up in canada were the men the islamic men getting the old
[3:14:25.160 --> 3:14:30.840]  ladies fame with the walker with it and he was a he was a syrian refugee welcome to canada
[3:14:30.840 --> 3:14:38.280]  and he repaid canada by going after an 87 year old woman in a walker why do they
[3:14:38.280 --> 3:14:43.160]  don't have that in that shit like i would never think about going after a woman or an old one
[3:14:43.160 --> 3:14:48.360]  particular but that's who they go for it's like oh i'm gonna target weak people yeah i would go for
[3:14:48.360 --> 3:14:53.160]  the biggest guy if i was gonna attack people i'd wind up run straight at him and break their neck
[3:14:53.160 --> 3:14:58.920]  i wouldn't go pick women yeah because instinctively that rallies your enemies to cross you you know
[3:14:58.920 --> 3:15:04.760]  chivalry is actually built into this so we win we only go after men that it's programmed that way
[3:15:04.760 --> 3:15:10.440]  you don't go after women what the hell's your problem you man i tell you i'm so pissed right now
[3:15:12.280 --> 3:15:20.280]  i'm hinged well i mean i mean i mean there's such punks that they think they're allowed to do it

[3:19:52.360 --> 3:19:58.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:22.760 --> 3:20:31.160]  i've witnessed the terror within and i rise committed to oppose the insidious forces
[3:20:31.160 --> 3:20:38.120]  which threaten our republic america is being severely injured by this betrayal by this unjust
[3:20:38.120 --> 3:20:44.440]  and weaponized impeachment brought upon us by the same socialist who threatened unborn life in the
[3:20:44.440 --> 3:20:49.960]  womb who threatened first amendment rights of conservatives who threatened second amendment
[3:20:49.960 --> 3:20:56.600]  protections of every american patriot and who have long ago determined that they would organize
[3:20:56.600 --> 3:21:06.440]  and conspire to overthrow president trump we don't face this horror because the democrats
[3:21:06.440 --> 3:21:13.080]  of all of a sudden become constitutionalist we're not being devoured from within because of some
[3:21:13.080 --> 3:21:18.280]  surreal assertion of the socialist newfound love for the very flag that they trod upon
[3:21:18.280 --> 3:21:26.040]  on we face this horror because of this map this is what the democrats fear they fear the true will
[3:21:26.040 --> 3:21:35.400]  of we the people they are deep establishment dc they fear they call this republican map fly over
[3:21:35.400 --> 3:21:42.040]  country they call us deplorables they fear our faith they fear our strength they fear our unity
[3:21:42.040 --> 3:21:49.240]  they fear our vote and they fear our president we will never surrender our nation to career
[3:21:49.240 --> 3:21:56.520]  establishment dc politicians and bureaucrats our republic shall survive this threat from within
[3:21:57.160 --> 3:22:06.200]  american patriots shall prevail mr speaker i yield and that is absolute truth
[3:22:06.200 --> 3:22:15.560]  from clay higgins representative from louisiana welcome back to the alex joneshow owen treuer
[3:22:15.560 --> 3:22:20.360]  now in the driver's seat i will be with you for the remainder of the joneshow and then the war room
[3:22:21.240 --> 3:22:28.680]  where we will be carrying live coverage of the impeachment really this is the cold civil war
[3:22:28.680 --> 3:22:37.160]  being broadcast on national television that's what this really comes down to now it's costume its
[3:22:37.800 --> 3:22:49.880]  appearance is impeachment hearings but it's real fabric is a cold civil war where the
[3:22:49.880 --> 3:22:55.880]  democrats want to destroy america and the republicans just want to at least have america
[3:22:55.880 --> 3:23:04.760]  and that's really what this comes down to because what would an enemy of america do
[3:23:05.960 --> 3:23:13.240]  they would overthrow our leader they would censor our free speech and they would disarm
[3:23:13.240 --> 3:23:21.160]  our citizens they would also kill our unborn ladies and gentlemen i just described for you
[3:23:21.160 --> 3:23:29.880]  the democrat party so before we go back live i'm gonna take these last two calls but man i'll
[3:23:29.880 --> 3:23:35.080]  just say this when i was listening to the democrat step up one by one and just lie through their
[3:23:35.080 --> 3:23:45.320]  teeth knowingly it's never been more heavier on my heart these people are going to hell for what
[3:23:45.320 --> 3:23:56.440]  they're doing and it's not even about america it's about deceit conscious deceit willing deceit
[3:23:59.320 --> 3:24:07.080]  and an attack on innocence for people that just don't know better and so they got a special
[3:24:07.080 --> 3:24:19.400]  place in hell for people like the democrats today lying about what donald trump has and hasn't done
[3:24:20.280 --> 3:24:23.480]  now let's go back to the phone lines before we go back live to these hearings and again
[3:24:23.480 --> 3:24:28.200]  we'll be covering this all through the night let's start with james in texas go ahead james
[3:24:28.200 --> 3:24:36.120]  yes hey uh i just want to thank uh info wars and uh alex for all the great products i just ordered
[3:24:36.120 --> 3:24:43.960]  the 99 dollar pack um what i wanted to say was about the epstein thing um i was a correctional
[3:24:43.960 --> 3:24:49.240]  officer federal and state and uh it would be easy to slip in there and did what they did to him
[3:24:49.240 --> 3:24:55.000]  because we have we had people on suicide watch they usually were people like him yet the rules
[3:24:55.000 --> 3:25:02.200]  were 15 minutes you had to check up on him walking down the run right and so they can slip in somebody
[3:25:02.200 --> 3:25:08.280]  from another outside agency could come in there and do whatever you know i mean well and it turned
[3:25:08.280 --> 3:25:16.200]  out the normal guards weren't on that night and of course you had all the uh the camera anomalies
[3:25:16.200 --> 3:25:21.400]  so there's there's look we know fc didn't kill himself i mean you know i you can place your
[3:25:21.400 --> 3:25:27.080]  bets on what you think happened he didn't commit suicide well the thing is when you're on suicide
[3:25:27.080 --> 3:25:32.360]  watch you have to like i had a guy that was in software strength okay and i can talk about this
[3:25:32.360 --> 3:25:38.040]  now but i couldn't for a while he wasn't uh he was prosecuted uh he was with al-qaeda at the time
[3:25:38.040 --> 3:25:42.520]  and he was sent down al-quanamal bay he's down there for i think he got triple life or tribunals
[3:25:42.520 --> 3:25:49.720]  when they were in there and i had to sit in front of his uh cell and this guy was in software strength
[3:25:49.720 --> 3:25:53.800]  and i was able to give him cigarettes and this is very unlikely but they wanted to keep him calm to
[3:25:53.800 --> 3:25:58.600]  get him transferred to the mental facility they have in rochester new york or if you know about the
[3:25:58.600 --> 3:26:03.480]  anyway but i had to sit literally in front of the cell and i gave him i let cigarettes for him
[3:26:04.040 --> 3:26:08.680]  and i gave him coffee and i had to remind him to hand me out his utensils because they were afraid
[3:26:08.680 --> 3:26:13.400]  to do something to himself right but he was sitting there you know all you know basically
[3:26:13.400 --> 3:26:17.320]  short we short chained him because he was trying to hurt himself tried to cut himself with a
[3:26:17.320 --> 3:26:22.600]  plastic spoon right he took it on the concrete had him in there on a concrete bed in a mattress
[3:26:22.600 --> 3:26:28.120]  and we had to take his blanket away so he wouldn't hurt himself but you know this guy had taken a
[3:26:28.120 --> 3:26:33.960]  plastic knife and cut from his elbow all the way to the end of his fingers like six times
[3:26:33.960 --> 3:26:39.720]  in each side had staples and when the the uh physician's assistant went in to take the staples
[3:26:39.720 --> 3:26:43.640]  out he was trying to pull him out with his teeth that's why we had to put him in software strength
[3:26:43.640 --> 3:26:50.920]  so he wouldn't bleed to death and this guy was wacko but i'm just saying that it just it just it
[3:26:50.920 --> 3:26:56.200]  just but but this is not even the behavior exhibited by epstein he didn't even exhibit really
[3:26:56.200 --> 3:27:01.480]  suicidal behavior they put him on the suicide watch i think it was more because he was such a
[3:27:02.280 --> 3:27:08.440]  one on that policy one of that's policy from the ADA um because what it is in the federal
[3:27:08.440 --> 3:27:13.080]  he was in a federal lockup and i forget where but no that's that's policy because when you're at
[3:27:13.080 --> 3:27:18.360]  when you're accused of a crime you're a you're a high risk for suicide watch so you put that's this
[3:27:18.360 --> 3:27:23.640]  policy that's uh institutional policy that's ADA rules certified everywhere that's something you
[3:27:23.640 --> 3:27:29.000]  have to do because when you're you're your highest rate of suicide and i even took some college courses
[3:27:29.000 --> 3:27:35.080]  we had to go to training every year um for the medical um is during that time for pretrial
[3:27:35.960 --> 3:27:41.640]  um and plus what he was there for and if you talk to any of the the wacko uh groups like the

[3:35:21.080 --> 3:35:25.960]  fraud hearings go ahead denis hey owen how's it going owen good denis yeah this impeachment
[3:35:25.960 --> 3:35:30.760]  thing is crazy you know the democrats they are just so out of control and if you see what's
[3:35:30.760 --> 3:35:35.640]  happening here in virginia i'm calling from the part of atlasia it's in the southwest corner of
[3:35:35.640 --> 3:35:44.280]  virginia uh these people are trying to take away our second amendment right but i think the governor
[3:35:44.280 --> 3:35:49.720]  and the house of their richman they need to take a look at our state seal again because it shows the
[3:35:49.720 --> 3:35:59.320]  goddess of virtue standing over top a dead tyrant and our state motto adopted in 1776 is seek temper
[3:35:59.320 --> 3:36:06.760]  tyrannous that means death to tyrant but what concerns me is you know we do have law enforcement
[3:36:06.760 --> 3:36:12.440]  and all the citizens are gearing up against this if the federal government causes an insurrection
[3:36:12.440 --> 3:36:19.160]  could this lead to an event like the battle of blare mountain in 1921 where the feds were
[3:36:19.160 --> 3:36:27.960]  sitting against the coal miners well i don't know about that but i do know this if they actually attempt
[3:36:27.960 --> 3:36:32.920]  to remove trump from office if they actually reach that point i don't think it will get there just
[3:36:32.920 --> 3:36:37.800]  with impeachment but if they actually attempt to remove him from office i do think there will be such
[3:36:37.800 --> 3:36:44.600]  a backlash and i do fear that there will be violence i don't want this i don't want a civil war
[3:36:44.600 --> 3:36:53.480]  that's the last thing i want believe me but i mean we're talking about an enemy of america again i
[3:36:53.480 --> 3:37:00.040]  said this what would let's define the traits let's define the behaviors let's define the
[3:37:00.040 --> 3:37:06.040]  characteristics of an enemy of america well they would overthrow our leader they would censor our
[3:37:06.040 --> 3:37:11.400]  free speech they would disarm our citizens and they would kill our unborn well i just described
[3:37:11.400 --> 3:37:17.000]  the democrat party so i mean this is this is serious business right here and and i'm at a
[3:37:17.000 --> 3:37:20.600]  point now and people that that follow the war room that i host from three to six which will have
[3:37:20.600 --> 3:37:25.480]  continued coverage of this and open phone lines from three to six at info wars dot com slash show
[3:37:25.480 --> 3:37:36.440]  and band out video i just think uh there's just it's it i'm usually obsessed with news my point
[3:37:36.440 --> 3:37:41.640]  is that this is it i mean this is the history this is it there's there's nothing bigger than
[3:37:41.640 --> 3:37:47.080]  this happening right now this is either america lives or america dies the democrats either become
[3:37:47.080 --> 3:37:52.440]  tyrants become authoritarians become dictators that's what they want or america stands up and
[3:37:52.440 --> 3:37:59.640]  says no and trump is the the figure piece trump is the king piece in chess that we cannot let them
[3:37:59.640 --> 3:38:04.360]  topple or that's their victory over america now again what happens after that i don't know we still
[3:38:04.360 --> 3:38:08.600]  have millions of armed americans in this country again i you know i'm hoping it doesn't get to that
[3:38:08.600 --> 3:38:13.880]  but uh you're not going to remove our leader illegally and we're not going to sit here and
[3:38:13.880 --> 3:38:17.080]  take it we're not going to sit here and be run over by tyrants exactly dennis
[3:38:18.920 --> 3:38:23.480]  yeah you know i think we got some battles ahead i think they want to use virginia as maybe a test
[3:38:23.480 --> 3:38:30.680]  case on the second amendment and you know how much support there is for trump but if anything uh i mean
[3:38:31.480 --> 3:38:35.960]  us as patriots we're getting stronger by the day in spite of what the democrats are doing
[3:38:37.400 --> 3:38:43.480]  we're getting stronger well i can certainly feel it and i think that everybody can and it's
[3:38:43.480 --> 3:38:49.320]  going to be an interesting furlough over christmas and new years before we really spiritually gear
[3:38:49.320 --> 3:38:57.640]  up for 2020 politically gear up for 2020 and batten down the hatches for the storm that is quickly
[3:38:57.640 --> 3:39:02.760]  ahead uh dennis thank you so much for the call now louis gomer is speaking right now i want to get
[3:39:03.800 --> 3:39:11.000]  this live uh the crew is working on getting louis gomer's comments live uh so guys let me
[3:39:11.000 --> 3:39:17.240]  know when that's ready but again when the alex joneshow concludes here at three o'clock central
[3:39:17.240 --> 3:39:22.920]  i'm going to continue this coverage on through the war room three to six p.m central and we're
[3:39:22.920 --> 3:39:28.520]  going to continue live coverage of the cold civil war happening in congress today and we're going to
[3:39:28.520 --> 3:39:38.680]  have open phone lines your responses to it um but i'm really just floored i can't believe that the
[3:39:38.680 --> 3:39:42.440]  democrats are actually i mean i can't believe it i mean we knew they were going to do it we
[3:39:42.440 --> 3:39:48.680]  told you they would do it i guess what i really can't believe is just the unmitigated nerve for
[3:39:48.680 --> 3:39:55.480]  them to be such bold-faced liars to be such conscious deceivers to be so willing
[3:39:55.480 --> 3:40:06.680]  to be phonies and frauds for all america to see and i look at a jerry nadler and i wonder
[3:40:09.160 --> 3:40:17.560]  what blackmail do people have on that guy because i'm sorry i cannot think of another
[3:40:17.560 --> 3:40:22.200]  rational explanation as to why any americans would be behaving like these democrats are today
[3:40:22.200 --> 3:40:28.200]  okay i can't fathom it they have blackmail on them folks nancy plosie is as crooked and dirty
[3:40:28.200 --> 3:40:34.600]  as the day is long so is adam schiff by the way the wave of people confronting politicians
[3:40:34.600 --> 3:40:40.040]  continues today ben berkwan who's been a guest on infor as many times a patriot
[3:40:42.040 --> 3:40:46.360]  confronted adam schiff peacefully legally lawfully read him his maranda writes
[3:40:46.360 --> 3:40:58.440]  this we'll have that clip on the war room but i do wonder when our american citizens
[3:40:58.440 --> 3:41:03.960]  going to say we've had enough and yeah it's starting slowly but surely and it's the same
[3:41:03.960 --> 3:41:09.160]  name in the same faces but when is the average joe going to stand up when is the average jane
[3:41:09.160 --> 3:41:16.440]  going to stand up when is john dowd going to stand up when is jane doe going to stand up when does
[3:41:16.440 --> 3:41:24.280]  john smith step up and say i've had enough it's it's on the precipice folks because a lot of these
[3:41:24.280 --> 3:41:28.680]  people never thought it would get this far a lot of these people still aren't paying attention
[3:41:28.680 --> 3:41:33.880]  they just think it's politics is normal it ain't the democrats are trying to overthrow this republic
[3:41:33.880 --> 3:41:42.680]  point blank the democrats are trying to overthrow your rights and they've got all the quote

[3:41:54.200 --> 3:42:03.240]  the only justice sadly would be for these democrats to be arrested
[3:42:06.440 --> 3:42:14.440]  that's it folks that's it they're the ones obstructing congress they're the ones engaged
[3:42:14.440 --> 3:42:21.800]  in sedition and they know it and america knows it and i got news for you you remove president
[3:42:21.800 --> 3:42:27.000]  trump it's not going to be good you throw the likes of nadler and pelosi in jail nobody's
[3:42:27.000 --> 3:42:35.240]  going to shed a tear let me tell you some the day hillary clinton goes to jail the day barack obama
[3:42:35.240 --> 3:42:40.600]  goes to jail you know conservatives don't usually do rallies and parades and marches and stuff like
[3:42:40.600 --> 3:42:47.400]  that it will be like the day we won world war two ticker tape parades everywhere america rejuvenation

[3:47:31.800 --> 3:47:36.360]  if he's ever quite in defense writing out the days event
[3:47:36.360 --> 3:47:42.280]  i really don't have the words to properly
[3:47:45.880 --> 3:47:49.000]  do justice to what we're witnessing here today
[3:47:53.640 --> 3:47:58.360]  and i put out a question on twitter today what happens if trump is removed from office what
[3:47:58.360 --> 3:48:03.080]  happens if the democrats removed from from office and people still have this notion that no it's
[3:48:03.080 --> 3:48:11.640]  impossible uh ladies and gentlemen they have effectively already removed trump from office
[3:48:11.640 --> 3:48:19.080]  if you think about it trump has not been able to do most the stuff that he should be able to do
[3:48:19.080 --> 3:48:25.000]  because of this nonsense the democrats have stopped america from uniting behind trump and
[3:48:25.000 --> 3:48:30.920]  this american rejuvenation because of all their nonsense i mean that is removing trump from
[3:48:30.920 --> 3:48:36.280]  office i mean that's that's that's that's kneecapping him that's chopping off his arms and legs and
[3:48:36.280 --> 3:48:42.280]  all he can do is roll around in the oval office so this whole notion of well trump's still the
[3:48:42.280 --> 3:48:52.680]  president we're we're still winning no no no no no these blood-sucking demons like jerry nadler
[3:48:52.680 --> 3:49:01.400]  are being allowed to do this i mean
[3:49:03.240 --> 3:49:06.760]  i just i don't think people realize how serious this actually is
[3:49:09.720 --> 3:49:14.520]  and and in a certain level i mean i i don't even i can't even fathom it quite frankly i mean this
[3:49:14.520 --> 3:49:24.440]  is literally we are in the death throes of this republic right now and it cannot be emphasized enough
[3:49:30.280 --> 3:49:39.400]  and i i i can't even look at jerry nadler without seeing satan i can't even look at hillary clinton
[3:49:39.400 --> 3:49:49.000]  without seeing satan i can't even look at nancy plosy without seeing satan but forget that
[3:49:56.040 --> 3:50:02.040]  what really what it really is is that the average american sees these people and knows
[3:50:02.040 --> 3:50:10.840]  that they're total corrupt criminal politicians total anti-american scum but there they are folks
[3:50:12.920 --> 3:50:19.160]  trying to dictate this country's fate trying to destroy this country's backbone trying to suffocate us
[3:50:23.640 --> 3:50:28.920]  i really don't even know what to say and i really just want to play this louis gomer clip and just
[3:50:28.920 --> 3:50:33.400]  go back live in fact guys can we just go live to nadler speaking right now so that my head will
[3:50:33.400 --> 3:50:42.280]  blow off in anger can we just do that let's just do that just 19 minutes after press this is louis
[3:50:42.280 --> 3:50:48.360]  gomer never mind 19 minutes freshman congresswoman from michigan total group of supporters i'm sorry
[3:50:48.360 --> 3:50:54.440]  impeach the mother blank shortly after she was sworn in even speaker plosy admitted last week
[3:50:54.440 --> 3:50:59.640]  that the impeachment effort has been going on for two and a half years long before any phone call
[3:50:59.640 --> 3:51:05.560]  between two world leaders in fact 71 percent of the democrats on the judiciary committee supported
[3:51:05.560 --> 3:51:11.480]  impeachment before the phone call the impeachment sham is based on hearsay conjecture and opinion
[3:51:11.480 --> 3:51:16.120]  you know what you can't even get a speeding ticket in this country based on hearsay but yet
[3:51:16.120 --> 3:51:21.880]  we're going to impeach an american president based on just that where the crimes of treason
[3:51:21.880 --> 3:51:26.680]  high crimes or misdemeanors committed here those are things that constitute impeachable offenses
[3:51:26.680 --> 3:51:31.640]  not hatred or policy disagreements if memory serves me right congress told the administration to
[3:51:31.640 --> 3:51:36.120]  withhold aid to ukraine until they got their act together address corruption and you know by
[3:51:36.120 --> 3:51:39.480]  way so this is live right now uh by the way i want to address this and then we're going to go to
[3:51:39.480 --> 3:51:45.720]  louis gomer and then i'm taking over on the war room here i thought more deeply about this whole
[3:51:45.720 --> 3:51:53.240]  ukraine gate thing that they're trying to push and we got to quit playing ball with their in
[3:51:53.240 --> 3:51:57.880]  their arenas we got to quit giving them home field advantage we ought to own it and say yeah trump
[3:51:57.880 --> 3:52:02.760]  trump trump did want biden investigated he's a damn crook he's a damn criminal yeah good
[3:52:02.760 --> 3:52:10.120]  investigate joe biden that damn crook arrest that bastard absolutely joe biden is corrupt as the day
[3:52:10.120 --> 3:52:16.040]  is long absolutely trump wanted him investigated absolutely ukraine was investigating him he is
[3:52:16.040 --> 3:52:22.600]  a pervert he can't keep his hands off of children he literally talks about it this is sick and this
[3:52:22.600 --> 3:52:28.920]  is what the democrats defend and we're left here to play in their arena and say oh trump innocent
[3:52:28.920 --> 3:52:34.360]  trump innocent no joe biden is a damn treasonous i need to stop right here let's just go to louis
[3:52:34.360 --> 3:52:38.440]  gomer i'm losing it i just need to calm down i can't do this today my voice is already going
[3:52:38.440 --> 3:52:43.720]  yes these damn democrats are the spawns of satan let's go to louis gomer please i think my
[3:52:43.720 --> 3:52:49.720]  colleague uh chairman adler i thank him for the extraordinary job one thing hasn't changed and that
[3:52:49.720 --> 3:52:58.840]  is the intent to impeach this president it's always been there but let's be honest the president
[3:52:58.840 --> 3:53:08.280]  turning is back on ukraine that happened in 2009 because in 2008 ukraine invaded georgia what happened
[3:53:08.280 --> 3:53:14.520]  bush put sanctions on russia to teach him a lesson what happened after that well in march of 2009
[3:53:14.520 --> 3:53:20.600]  hillary clinton was sent over to russia with a reset button to say bush overreacted we're okay
[3:53:20.600 --> 3:53:26.440]  that you invaded georgia it was a green light to russia to invade ukraine and what do you do oh
[3:53:26.440 --> 3:53:32.760]  yeah you send blankets and mre's they can eat and be warm while the russians are killing them that
[3:53:32.760 --> 3:53:42.280]  is what the obama administration did this is a travesty and we're in big trouble because
[3:53:42.280 --> 3:53:49.160]  schumer was right now it's lowered even farther the bar it will be used for political battles
[3:53:49.160 --> 3:53:56.920]  and this country's end is now inside i hope i don't leave live to see it this is an outrage i yield
[3:53:56.920 --> 3:54:04.440]  back gentlemen from the absolute veritas from louis gomer and he got it remember here's the first
[3:54:04.440 --> 3:54:07.400]  one that said look the democrats committing treason they're trying to start a civil war
[3:54:08.440 --> 3:54:14.200]  said it months ago and you can see the conviction you can see him almost brought to tears and it's
[3:54:14.200 --> 3:54:18.520]  the same thing it's the best of both worlds you know in one sense america's rising in his back
[3:54:18.520 --> 3:54:23.320]  and then another sense these satanic demons known as democrats are trying to kill us uh let's go to
[3:54:23.320 --> 3:54:27.480]  now adam schiff i'm gonna try not to have my head explode live on air but adam schiff is a spawn of
[3:54:27.480 --> 3:54:34.360]  satan let's go live to a spawn of satan conduct of our elections i would say that the founders could
[3:54:34.360 --> 3:54:38.520]  have little imagined that a single or the founders the founders who they say need to be erased from
[3:54:38.520 --> 3:54:45.720]  history except i can't do i can't do this man is exactly what this president has done
[3:54:45.720 --> 3:54:52.920]  hamilton among others seems to have predicted the rise of donald trump with a staggering presence
[3:54:54.360 --> 3:55:00.440]  having one freedom from a king the drafters of our constitution designed a government in which
[3:55:00.440 --> 3:55:07.560]  ambition was made to check ambition in which no branch of government would predominate over another
[3:55:08.120 --> 3:55:14.040]  and no man would be allowed to be above the law including the president especially the president
[3:55:14.040 --> 3:55:19.560]  mr schiff since with you are under arrest for treason then with you have the right to remain
[3:55:19.560 --> 3:55:25.240]  silent you are not required to say anything to us at any time or to answer any questions
[3:55:25.240 --> 3:55:30.040]  anything you can or anything you say can be used against you in court you have the right to talk
[3:55:30.040 --> 3:55:35.320]  to a lawyer for advice before we question you and have him with you during questioning if you
[3:55:35.320 --> 3:55:40.200]  cannot afford a lawyer and want one a lawyer will be provided for you if you want to answer
[3:55:40.200 --> 3:55:45.320]  questions now without a lawyer present you will still have the right to stop answering at any time
[3:55:45.320 --> 3:55:49.800]  you also have the right to stop answering at any time until you talk to a lawyer do you understand
[3:55:49.800 --> 3:55:58.920]  treasonous adam schiff to be undertaken just simply announced to the public the smear of his
[3:55:58.920 --> 3:56:03.800]  opponent the smear of his opponent you understand that's a lot would be enough joe biden is not
[3:56:03.800 --> 3:56:08.520]  trump's opponent to effect joe biden hasn't even got the democrat nomination so the very basis of
[3:56:08.520 --> 3:56:15.240]  that is a lie but it doesn't even matter to these people seriously i folks i i don't want to i don't
[3:56:15.240 --> 3:56:19.080]  want to debase the war room the coming up for the next three hours where i have great guests and
[3:56:19.080 --> 3:56:23.720]  savannah hernandez and i don't want to debase it just by starting and yelling and my head popping
[3:56:23.720 --> 3:56:27.560]  off and just referring to these people as satan spawns even though they are so i'm really just
[3:56:27.560 --> 3:56:33.320]  going to open up the phone lines and just play the audio from the the cold civil war that's
[3:56:33.320 --> 3:56:38.600]  being broadcast now on tv but uh sign off the alex jones show with this this is this is everything
[3:56:38.600 --> 3:56:45.080]  info wars has been telling you for the last 20 years folks okay it's all here now we reached the point
[3:56:45.960 --> 3:56:52.280]  i don't know how to put it to you i was brought to tears earlier today listening to all the americans
[3:56:52.280 --> 3:56:57.400]  standing up and confronting politicians another one just happened today bender bergum red adam
[3:56:57.400 --> 3:57:03.480]  schiff is miranda writes um the next the next stage here is the democrats either arrest all of us and
[3:57:03.480 --> 3:57:13.160]  kill us or they can back off and we can just have america rejuvenate research and come together
[3:57:13.160 --> 3:57:16.920]  but they're not going to they're going all out and you know how this is going to go folks and
[3:57:16.920 --> 3:57:22.920]  it's not good so we really just need to pray to god more than ever we really just need to pray to
[3:57:22.920 --> 3:57:28.280]  god to just bring these people to justice because it doesn't seem that there's a man willing to do it i
[3:57:28.280 --> 3:57:34.280]  pray to god there is but it's just unbelievable folks i'll be right back hosting the war room i
[3:57:34.280 --> 3:57:58.200]  cannot believe the treason the democrats are under only god can save us now
