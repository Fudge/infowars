[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:33.760]  we're live my friends it is Thursday the 19th day of May 2011 we're gonna be live
[00:33.760 --> 00:40.240]  here for at least the next three hours we have Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us on
[00:40.240 --> 00:44.880]  the economy and also his contention that this is a police state set up with
[00:44.880 --> 00:50.040]  Dominique Strauss Kahn because Kahn hadn't been going along with the absolute
[00:50.040 --> 00:55.520]  total raping of Third World Nations and had actually been talking about debt
[00:55.520 --> 01:00.680]  forgiveness and changing course at the IMF Kahn is a Bilderberg group member
[01:00.680 --> 01:06.440]  globalist one-world government promoter and it's all degrees of evil but when
[01:06.440 --> 01:11.400]  you're that far down the line the guy just radiated corruption I have no doubt
[01:11.400 --> 01:13.880]  where there's smoke there's fire but I want to hear what Dr. Paul Craig
[01:13.880 --> 01:18.480]  Roberts has to say about all this today coming up in an hour and a half from
[01:18.480 --> 01:25.840]  now and another visit with Dr. Steve Pachennick today in the third hour we
[01:25.840 --> 01:29.480]  may be going a little bit of overdrive with him to take your phone calls you've
[01:29.480 --> 01:33.120]  got any questions or comments for him but I will bring up the continuity of
[01:33.120 --> 01:40.560]  agenda question for him that listeners have wanted me to pose how can he say
[01:40.560 --> 01:45.040]  that George Herbert Walker Bush was good but then George W. Bush is bad how can
[01:45.040 --> 01:50.040]  he say 9-11's an inside job and the bin Laden thinks fake and then say that
[01:50.040 --> 01:53.920]  earlier administrations from his perspective were better well that's
[01:53.920 --> 01:59.880]  his personal view we've had him on about his inside intel as a psychological
[01:59.880 --> 02:05.760]  warfare expert and the whole bin Laden situation but I will pose that question
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.960]  to him but I've also got him on dealing with a Wall Street Journal article that
[02:10.960 --> 02:19.920]  dealt with Al Qaeda wanting a safe harbor inside the United States and a known
[02:19.920 --> 02:27.480]  Al Qaeda affiliate basically being mainlined by the US media and what
[02:27.480 --> 02:30.760]  Pachennick calls payoffs to administration officials to get them to do
[02:30.760 --> 02:35.440]  that so some very interesting information with Dr. Steve Pachennick
[02:35.440 --> 02:42.480]  coming up in the third hour today that said I ended up staying up here until
[02:42.480 --> 02:47.680]  around midnight last night Aaron Dykes has not even left even though I told him
[02:47.680 --> 02:53.360]  I said look go ahead and come back in you know don't stay too late I guess
[02:53.360 --> 02:57.120]  midnight around here in that late these days I said don't stay up all night
[02:57.120 --> 03:02.880]  well you Aaron has such a passion for the information that he's here right now
[03:02.880 --> 03:11.600]  the 10-minute expose video is ready but because it's shot in high death it has
[03:11.600 --> 03:18.320]  to convert several times before it can be uploaded to YouTube and it may be
[03:18.320 --> 03:22.400]  ready by the end of the show probably not I haven't even come up with a
[03:22.400 --> 03:29.320]  headline for it I don't know what you call this just a White House running
[03:29.320 --> 03:36.680]  scared over birth certificate birth certificate hoax part two I've got a big
[03:36.680 --> 03:43.720]  stack of news and information that broke last night at info wars.com and
[03:43.720 --> 03:49.480]  prisonplanet.com birther bombshell Corsi to release evidence proving Obama's
[03:49.480 --> 03:56.120]  certificate a fraudulent composite we've already found that but the Corsi is
[03:56.120 --> 04:02.640]  pretty conservative when it comes to being very careful to make bold
[04:02.640 --> 04:08.200]  statements and his book doesn't even say that you know Obama basically wasn't
[04:08.200 --> 04:12.520]  born in Hawaii it just says there's a cover-up of it and give us the birth
[04:12.520 --> 04:15.880]  certificate and Corsi's revealed that three weeks before the birth certificate
[04:15.880 --> 04:22.280]  was released he had word it was going to be released I also had word through
[04:22.280 --> 04:26.800]  reporters in and around the White House and out of Chicago that that was the
[04:26.800 --> 04:32.560]  case and they thought about releasing it with Bill O'Reilly on the Super Bowl but
[04:32.560 --> 04:35.800]  thought better of it to closer to the election there's been some big
[04:35.800 --> 04:40.440]  developments Esquire got caught putting out a hoax article yesterday WorldNet
[04:40.440 --> 04:45.560]  Daily says they're looking at suing them I think they pretty much have to because
[04:45.560 --> 04:51.840]  this was definitely economic warfare against WorldNet Daily and it's a
[04:51.840 --> 04:55.960]  psychological warfare tactic we'll tell you about that there's a bunch of
[04:55.960 --> 05:00.480]  geopolitical news very scary police-state news stay with us a very

[09:40.360 --> 09:44.960]  like strauss con because if this dirtbag doesn't have access to a free and
[09:44.960 --> 09:50.080]  fair trial i am not going to have one you understand that's why ron paul is

[10:04.440 --> 10:10.040]  trials are about their investigations of the truth and anybody that promotes not
[10:10.040 --> 10:14.080]  having trials anybody that promotes torture anybody that promotes secret
[10:14.080 --> 10:21.800]  arrest anybody that promotes secret military commissions is a tyrant and

[10:32.520 --> 10:38.680]  craig roberts on that coming up speaking of police state on the heels of last
[10:38.680 --> 10:42.880]  week's indiana supreme court ruling where the head judge in the decision in
[10:42.880 --> 10:48.640]  the in the winning decision was a three two at their supreme court said i read
[10:48.640 --> 10:53.040]  the quote repeatedly that the police can go in your house for any reason or no
[10:53.040 --> 10:58.800]  reason at all and it actually attacked the magna card as some type of criminal
[10:58.800 --> 11:03.320]  instrument i mean this is the basis of western civilization the republic
[11:03.320 --> 11:08.120]  america red white and blue see america isn't just red white and blue that we

[11:16.680 --> 11:21.040]  didn't perfect because we haven't enforced it we've let criminals slowly
[11:21.040 --> 11:26.040]  abridge it until now the bottom has fallen out same week u.s. supreme court
[11:26.040 --> 11:35.680]  abridge the fourth amendment about 90 percent this this gun case in indiana

[12:02.560 --> 12:08.000]  searching for guns just well you have no presumption of innocence we're gonna
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.800]  come search your guns and the feds of finance with grants and so the cops take
[12:11.800 --> 12:17.360]  it and do it knock and talk for at least a decade from arizona to texas from
[12:17.360 --> 12:22.000]  vermont to massachusetts to california liberal conservative states they don't
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.280]  care particularly texas does this houston and in dallas that i've seen in

[12:37.600 --> 12:42.200]  control it's not that we have something to hide and so that's why we're against
[12:42.200 --> 12:49.160]  letting them in it's that they can't be trusted in history they work for us 100
[12:49.160 --> 12:52.720]  percent of the time when cops start coming into your house without warrants
[12:52.720 --> 12:56.880]  and there's more news out of the thousands and thousands of secret
[12:56.880 --> 13:02.360]  sneak and peek warrants issued by secret federal courts under the patriot act and
[13:02.360 --> 13:07.680]  it's non-terror related in almost every case they just come in your house when
[13:07.680 --> 13:12.640]  you're not there and it's it's designed for framing you it's designed for
[13:12.640 --> 13:18.960]  planting things in your house and what happens if you catch the fbi or the atf

[13:50.360 --> 13:55.280]  somebody walking around by the back gate or one time somebody climbed the fence
[13:55.280 --> 13:59.800]  and got in our yard some crazed fan and my wife's woken me up for cuz i sleep

[14:33.000 --> 14:36.920]  do this they shoot 100 times and only hit the person two or three times of 70
[14:36.920 --> 14:42.160]  shots hit him 60 times bake basically liquefying him but he was still alive
[14:42.160 --> 14:46.800]  and what's really outraged folks are the transcripts of the tapes than the 911
[14:46.800 --> 14:52.360]  tapes she's calling saying please help and she goes sorry it's a swat team i'm
[14:52.360 --> 14:55.840]  not sending you an ambulance basically she's like he's bleeding to death he

[14:59.560 --> 15:03.160]  can't believe she's so calm she says listen the woman's like well in there's
[15:03.160 --> 15:06.400]  a swat team at that address those are law officers correct she's like he's

[15:10.600 --> 15:16.120]  didn't send the ambulance because you don't send an ambulance when gods have
[15:16.120 --> 15:20.000]  have just killed somebody and now all over the country they're announcing
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.920]  they're gonna do no knocks for everything you've got a an unpaid parking
[15:24.920 --> 15:28.400]  tickets and they're actually advertising this here in Austin they have
[15:28.400 --> 15:34.400]  announcements taxpayer paid for ads that go round up effect I always mean to try
[15:34.400 --> 15:39.920]  to find one of those I hear it on KLBJ and other stations round up this weekend
[15:39.920 --> 15:44.200]  your last chance sounds like it's a monster truck advertiser this week at
[15:44.200 --> 15:48.400]  the Coliseum a monster truck extravaganza be there be there the
[15:48.400 --> 15:54.520]  grave digger the master dinosaur crusher well it sounds like the same guy
[15:54.520 --> 15:59.240]  that does the monster truck ads this weekend the round up begins if you
[15:59.240 --> 16:04.960]  haven't paid your ticket the warrants coming we're coming to your house pay it
[16:04.960 --> 16:10.760]  now call this city number go online to pay openly trying to scare people now
[16:10.760 --> 16:16.000]  it's 11% of Texas has arrest warrants out oh that's a free society they can't
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.520]  pay their bankrupt cops everywhere writing tickets squeezing everyone
[16:20.520 --> 16:25.160]  illegal aliens above the law racing around but my point is they call it
[16:25.160 --> 16:28.400]  roundup they have these ads all over the country so people get used to hearing
[16:28.400 --> 16:31.760]  about real roundups of political dissidents when it happens it's an
[16:31.760 --> 16:35.760]  acclamation that's an army psych warfare program before the Panama
[16:35.760 --> 16:38.920]  invasion for months they flew helicopters around did touch and goes
[16:38.920 --> 16:43.000]  would drop flash bangs just so the Panamanian the Panamanian military
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.200]  when the real attack happened would hesitate just a minute or two while the
[16:47.200 --> 16:52.240]  C-130s blasted them with their Vulcan guns their Gatlin guns and their
[16:52.240 --> 16:57.880]  howitzers and and they hesitated just a few minutes and bye bye you thought it
[16:57.880 --> 17:01.960]  was another drill so this is all psych warfare police chiefs are on record
[17:01.960 --> 17:05.840]  admitting they wear the mask they they they do it to intimidate and the
[17:05.840 --> 17:10.760]  message is you don't pay parking tickets we're gonna kick your door down and just
[17:10.760 --> 17:14.960]  randomly spray bullets into a few people here and there to to and that's why
[17:14.960 --> 17:18.680]  they support the officers when they do it the cops aren't psychological warfare
[17:18.680 --> 17:21.440]  people they don't know why they're being allowed to do this they're all given a
[17:21.440 --> 17:25.640]  false template we've all seen the video of them go in the house they shoot the
[17:25.640 --> 17:29.480]  little dog the people are crying why'd you kill my dog and you watch the video
[17:29.480 --> 17:34.120]  of the cops getting off on the pain and the children crying I mean I've I've
[17:34.120 --> 17:38.560]  played these videos on air and it's demonic there's a satanic feasting on
[17:38.560 --> 17:46.280]  these psychic vampire level very wicked very evil I'm not saying every SWAT
[17:46.280 --> 17:49.720]  team in history was evil everybody was you know that does this is bad but more
[17:49.720 --> 17:56.640]  and more you see the sadomasochistic demonic psychic feasting going on
[17:56.640 --> 18:01.160]  remember SWAT teams are set up in the late 60s and mentally by Gates in Los
[18:01.160 --> 18:04.440]  Angeles and special weapons attack teams not special weapons at tactics
[18:04.440 --> 18:09.120]  that's the politically correct name the CIA helps set it up there a hostage
[18:09.120 --> 18:15.800]  rapid reaction force before they just had guys that had a lot of testosterone
[18:15.800 --> 18:19.920]  and didn't even need a helmet they put on some body armor strap it on go in and
[18:19.920 --> 18:23.360]  you know take out the hostages but now they they wait two or three hours and
[18:23.360 --> 18:28.680]  creep around and and it column by and or every other shooting and then don't help
[18:28.680 --> 18:35.360]  anybody I've talked to so many old retired cops and yeah in fact one of
[18:35.360 --> 18:40.520]  them owns a car repair place here in town got to know him years ago became an
[18:40.520 --> 18:44.640]  advertiser locally and he was just talking about when he was a detective
[18:44.640 --> 18:48.640]  they just they just they didn't need all the gear they just had testosterone but
[18:48.640 --> 18:52.880]  the point is this is all about and these are death squads now that's what
[18:52.880 --> 18:55.640]  they're being phased into that's what they're being turned into and it's a
[18:55.640 --> 18:59.080]  tool of intimidation so they're saying now we're gonna go ahead and just make
[18:59.080 --> 19:06.680]  every warrant service a no knock and so you move you thought you paid off a
[19:06.680 --> 19:09.600]  ticket I've had it before where I did pay off a ticket and had to call up
[19:09.600 --> 19:15.040]  courthouses and it's happened a couple times when it's a you know out of
[19:15.040 --> 19:19.920]  county thing and say you got that check I've got that cleared check I paid it
[19:19.920 --> 19:24.120]  they go well there was a $10 fee we forgot to assess so it's not good we
[19:24.120 --> 19:26.880]  sent you a letter and I'm like well I moved I must not have gotten let me pay
[19:26.880 --> 19:31.720]  the other $10 fee well now for the $10 fee and there's basically gonna convert
[19:31.720 --> 19:38.240]  large the effect they are larger and larger brigades of these people at the
[19:38.240 --> 19:44.720]  state level to just come hit down the door and if you always read about the
[19:44.720 --> 19:49.880]  old insurance salesman retired gets up wrong house they kill them 92 year old
[19:49.880 --> 19:54.640]  woman they kill her this Marine they kill him but see that gives them a
[19:54.640 --> 19:58.160]  propaganda problem because they teach you to worship the Marines but now one
[19:58.160 --> 20:03.440]  God has killed another God he looks five years younger he doesn't fall asleep at
[20:03.440 --> 20:07.720]  his desk like he used to he no longer drinks those energy drinks all day he
[20:07.720 --> 20:12.760]  used to be gloomy now he's upbeat he obviously has lost weight he's now

[22:05.520 --> 22:09.560]  Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of
[22:09.560 --> 22:13.960]  government bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a
[22:13.960 --> 22:19.080]  seller of US bonds in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing
[22:19.080 --> 22:22.800]  China by calling them currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is
[22:22.800 --> 22:26.800]  already buying about 70% of US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer
[22:26.800 --> 22:31.120]  left of US Treasuries our friends at the National Inflation Association believe
[22:31.120 --> 22:34.800]  that the US dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the

[24:02.560 --> 24:10.480]  by any historical yardstick we are turning into a hardcore police state
[24:10.480 --> 24:19.840]  with a offshore private banking cartel openly robbing us and incrementally
[24:19.840 --> 24:27.520]  turning our police into federalized merciless goons and in the process the
[24:27.520 --> 24:30.640]  police are destroying their own future but I don't even blame the police at the
[24:30.640 --> 24:35.560]  end of the day it is the American people that have sat ugly by and put up with
[24:35.560 --> 24:42.240]  this that have allowed this to happen now I started ranting about how they
[24:42.240 --> 24:48.960]  killed this poor marine again they saw men looking in the windows the children
[24:48.960 --> 24:53.040]  got scared this all happened in a matter of 30 seconds they busted down the door
[24:53.040 --> 24:58.640]  he reportedly didn't get a shot off and they just totally shot him full of
[24:58.640 --> 25:03.040]  holes and their argument is well we got to protect ourselves we're trying to
[25:03.040 --> 25:07.920]  stop narcotics well turns out no drugs found in the house and the reports were
[25:07.920 --> 25:11.720]  first it was the wrong house but which they do all the time you see it
[25:11.720 --> 25:17.160]  constantly in the press but now they're saying well no it was the right house
[25:17.160 --> 25:21.160]  kind of like the cops when they put that guy in handcuffs out in the Oakland on
[25:21.160 --> 25:26.080]  the train deck the platform and then shot him in the back and then told
[25:26.080 --> 25:29.440]  everybody that he'd fought them and wasn't in handcuffs after they confiscated
[25:29.440 --> 25:33.640]  three cameras turned out somebody was in a train that was stopped and filmed the
[25:33.640 --> 25:38.000]  whole thing and somebody else filmed it from about 50 yards away and he was in
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.840]  handcuffs and they just shot him in the back execution style you watch the video
[25:41.840 --> 25:45.680]  it doesn't look like it was an accident he stretches the gun out shoots him
[25:45.680 --> 25:51.360]  right in the back goes through his back bounces back up into his heart and it
[25:51.360 --> 25:55.560]  was suspects of a fight on the train turns out wasn't even the right guy it's
[25:55.560 --> 26:00.280]  like that case in New York or somebody punched a cop at a nightclub they set up
[26:00.280 --> 26:04.240]  a checkpoint outside searched everybody turned out he was the wrong guy and the
[26:04.240 --> 26:09.080]  cops took him to the facility and help beat him for eight hours off and on and
[26:09.080 --> 26:13.800]  finally some good cops blew the whistle and said that their commander
[26:13.800 --> 26:20.640]  sodomized him with a broken toilet plunger continually for two hours that
[26:20.640 --> 26:29.760]  that shows total psychopathic behavior I mean two hours and then blood was pouring
[26:29.760 --> 26:35.960]  out I mean how do you do what type of demon even if you were psychopathic
[26:35.960 --> 26:39.920]  wouldn't it get boring after 30 seconds I mean hours of of of
[26:39.920 --> 26:44.360]  sodomizing someone with a broken plunger I mean who are they hiring the
[26:44.360 --> 26:47.720]  middle rights and Constitution is supposed to protect us from crooks
[26:47.720 --> 26:51.760]  getting into government boss hogs getting in and then hiring thugs under
[26:51.760 --> 26:57.600]  them to where if boss hog tries to do that boss hog gets in trouble your
[26:57.600 --> 27:01.240]  county gets out of control you go to the state go to the Texas Rangers they
[27:01.240 --> 27:05.280]  come and deal with it they don't deal with it you vote in new reps same thing
[27:05.280 --> 27:10.280]  with the feds but we can't do that anymore and there's all these TV shows
[27:10.280 --> 27:12.840]  just worshiping what they're doing I mean I don't want to get into any more
[27:12.840 --> 27:17.000]  horrible stories of what the police are doing or how many cases of cops sitting
[27:17.000 --> 27:21.000]  outside topless bars pulling over the drunk dancers and demanding sex from them
[27:21.000 --> 27:26.840]  I mean there's a big percentage of people that want to be criminals and
[27:26.840 --> 27:32.040]  they're smart enough to go become police officers and and and this is the
[27:32.040 --> 27:35.560]  historical problem everybody knows that about Mexico and other third-world
[27:35.560 --> 27:42.560]  countries and Paul Watson was in Tibet and try to take some photos just of a
[27:42.560 --> 27:48.320]  mountain gorge and cops local cops it wasn't even the professional from his
[27:48.320 --> 27:52.960]  experiences quite a few times in China the national police it was the local
[27:52.960 --> 27:55.960]  cops came over demanded a bunch of money for him to take photos and then he saw
[27:55.960 --> 27:59.720]  them doing it to other tourists this is what happens in Mexico I mean
[27:59.720 --> 28:03.920]  everybody knows in third-world countries the cops are horrible and I remember
[28:03.920 --> 28:08.360]  going to third-world countries with my parents who are well traveled and I'm
[28:08.360 --> 28:12.480]  somewhat well-traveled because of them I remember seeing the cops looking goonish
[28:12.480 --> 28:16.560]  just as a child and thinking they look scary but seeing cops in America and
[28:16.560 --> 28:22.120]  they were usually you know tough guys but you know hi how you doing you felt
[28:22.120 --> 28:25.320]  good as a child seeing them I remember being in third-world countries and they
[28:25.320 --> 28:30.200]  were on power trips they had that evil look of in of abusing people and folks
[28:30.200 --> 28:34.840]  were scared of them and I remember being a child and being creeped out by them
[28:34.840 --> 28:38.440]  and I remember once being pulled over and the Mexican police demanding some
[28:38.440 --> 28:42.880]  money and how slimy they were with you know gold teeth and big mustaches and
[28:42.880 --> 28:48.760]  hanging money giving money well now I see cops a lot of them and that's what
[28:48.760 --> 28:52.480]  they're like I mean I won't go down to 6th Street at night because they have
[28:52.480 --> 28:56.980]  special units I guess you enjoy it we're like these shaved heads with devil
[28:56.980 --> 29:01.680]  tattoos all over and black gloves just looking at you trying to and it's like
[29:01.680 --> 29:05.720]  flashbacks to college of like bouncers showing off trying to start fights with
[29:05.720 --> 29:09.920]  people for no reason and I'm like what I mean I mean you see some guy with big
[29:09.920 --> 29:13.440]  black circles around his eyes and a shaved head and black gloves and he
[29:13.440 --> 29:16.680]  sees good-looking girls walking by and he comes over and demands their ID and
[29:16.680 --> 29:20.640]  looks at it and ask them questions I mean it's just it's living in a third
[29:20.640 --> 29:26.280]  world country I don't like it I mean you can just look at somebody if you've got
[29:26.280 --> 29:30.200]  any discernment generally and you know tell that's a nice person they have a
[29:30.200 --> 29:35.200]  good vibe and then you still see cops changing tires on and it always looks
[29:35.200 --> 29:38.240]  the same it's a middle-aged guy doesn't look like that doesn't have a craze
[29:38.240 --> 29:45.880]  looking his eyes you know you don't get a bad feeling more and more yes it's

[33:05.360 --> 33:14.280]  live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[33:16.760 --> 33:21.480]  let me cover a smattering of key news I'm getting in our big birther bombshell
[33:21.480 --> 33:26.640]  course you release evidence proving Obama certificate a fraudulent composite
[33:26.640 --> 33:30.840]  and you add that to what the White House did yesterday through their minions
[33:30.840 --> 33:35.360]  putting out a hoax dealing with course these world that daily book by the way
[33:35.360 --> 33:39.880]  we sell it info wars.com where's the birth certificate they're definitely
[33:39.880 --> 33:45.800]  running scared and more and more they're hiding something and remember I was
[33:45.800 --> 33:48.400]  getting criticized two and a half years ago because I was like I don't know where
[33:48.400 --> 33:53.280]  he was born and then I was like well he did his name did get changed to Barry
[33:53.280 --> 33:58.760]  Sotero and he was listed as Muslim and he lied about that
[33:58.760 --> 34:01.880]  doesn't matter if he's Muslim or not the point is he's lying about it in
[34:01.880 --> 34:06.680]  Indonesia had to get up and give up a citizenship I'm gonna be breaking that
[34:06.680 --> 34:11.800]  down because it's very important by the way Dr. Jerome Corsi does join us
[34:11.800 --> 34:15.520]  tomorrow and I believe tomorrow is the day he's gonna roll out his quote proof
[34:15.520 --> 34:20.080]  of this but we've already seen the proof the curing the the computer
[34:20.080 --> 34:24.720]  manipulation areas that are highly pixelated and low res areas that are
[34:24.720 --> 34:28.720]  high res hundred percent proof they went in and altered it and it's done
[34:28.720 --> 34:33.880]  shoddily so there's two different two different scenarios there I'm gonna
[34:33.880 --> 34:39.640]  break it down in a moment you notice all at once they're going yeah your phones
[34:39.640 --> 34:42.880]  tracking the end everything you're doing yeah there's government and corporate
[34:42.880 --> 34:46.560]  kill switches and all the major new electronic devices not just phones and
[34:46.560 --> 34:52.640]  computers washers dryers light bulbs the fluorescence data down power line is
[34:52.640 --> 34:57.720]  able to then use them as a flicker switch to activate and hack into your
[34:57.720 --> 35:03.080]  computers that's associated press I mean you can't make this stuff up a total
[35:03.080 --> 35:06.160]  control grid going in as I told you years ago they're now announcing
[35:06.160 --> 35:12.440]  government break-ins over radio TV internet cell phones 9,000 tele screens
[35:12.440 --> 35:16.640]  going in saying title on your neighbors I mean it's like they're following 1984 as
[35:16.640 --> 35:23.800]  if it was a script and on top of that they're building threat fusion centers
[35:23.800 --> 35:29.520]  everywhere openly having regular army National Guard Marine Corps checkpoints
[35:29.520 --> 35:35.960]  totally illegal National Guard arresting thousands in New York alone New York
[35:35.960 --> 35:40.640]  State I have that local Fox Newscast how great it is they drive you through the
[35:40.640 --> 35:45.120]  high-powered X-rays which are deadly and shows the troops standing around them
[35:45.120 --> 35:49.880]  and we help arrest 2,000 people for drugs and guns and just just all of it off
[35:49.880 --> 35:54.080]  the chart and oh look the armies of the Kentucky Derby they're arresting people
[35:54.080 --> 35:57.760]  that get in fights and stuff you know in the parking lot who were drunk and then
[35:57.760 --> 36:03.040]  they show it on the news I mean it's a full siop rollout and as I told you over
[36:03.040 --> 36:06.080]  a decade ago and they got rid of Glass-Steagall when we had George Humphrey
[36:06.080 --> 36:10.720]  and other economists on there they were going to create massive trillions now
[36:10.720 --> 36:14.720]  over one thousand trillion conservatively in fraudulent debt have our
[36:14.720 --> 36:18.640]  trader government bipartisan sign on to that debt that they created that we
[36:18.640 --> 36:24.200]  don't know as a ball and chain it's time to break the chains it's time to take
[36:24.200 --> 36:28.280]  the balls to the walls and go all the way and take the wrecking balls and knock
[36:28.280 --> 36:32.920]  down this modern Berlin wall of the mind and it's time for police military
[36:32.920 --> 36:37.600]  bureaucrats those that serve the system to break the trance this is not for
[36:37.600 --> 36:42.200]  security this is not good this is a criminal government and it's way bigger
[36:42.200 --> 36:48.560]  than Barack Obama let's get that straight
[36:50.280 --> 36:54.480]  guys I forgot to get a water we get me one please just because I'm gonna start
[36:54.480 --> 36:57.600]  hacking here on there thank you
[36:57.600 --> 37:07.760]  some reason coffee just doesn't seem to stop you from coffin thank you now that
[37:07.760 --> 37:13.040]  said here's just some of the police statements just some of it you know
[37:13.040 --> 37:18.080]  Indiana last week and the US Supreme Court separately both rule that there's
[37:18.080 --> 37:24.520]  no fourth amendment and the the Indiana ruling gives me chills every time I read
[37:24.520 --> 37:32.520]  it it is so criminal it is so bold that the that the chief justice said that
[37:32.520 --> 37:35.760]  the police can go in your house without a warrant for any reason or no reason at
[37:35.760 --> 37:40.840]  all I mean it is not any more broad than that and then suddenly all over the news
[37:40.840 --> 37:45.880]  they're saying yes we've only been doing a few thousand a year which is a lot now
[37:45.880 --> 37:50.400]  we're they're gonna expand and now even local jurisdictions not just federal
[37:50.400 --> 37:55.960]  court are gonna issue sneak and peeks for the cops to go in your house when
[37:55.960 --> 38:03.240]  you don't even know they're there with this mass roving ground warrant kind of
[38:03.240 --> 38:06.680]  like the fake warrants judges have been swearing out under federal grants the
[38:06.680 --> 38:09.280]  states accept the grants and the judges get behind it in the political
[38:09.280 --> 38:13.520]  jurisdictions that are particularly treasonous like Austin and they take
[38:13.520 --> 38:18.560]  blood at checkpoints without a warrant and my real estate lawyers a well known
[38:18.560 --> 38:23.840]  former high-level state judge and I was in his office last year and he brought
[38:23.840 --> 38:26.800]  that ruling up to me and he just said I can't believe America's turned into this
[38:26.800 --> 38:31.360]  he just says we're in a lot of trouble the bottom has dropped out and that of
[38:31.360 --> 38:36.240]  course is a legal term there's nothing holding them back now except our moral
[38:36.240 --> 38:40.080]  courage to stand up and to get good people into government to reverse these
[38:40.080 --> 38:44.240]  courts I mean it's the chains have been broken by the tyrants the dragon is
[38:44.240 --> 38:50.400]  loose and they're chaining us down with bureaucracy and propaganda and economic
[38:50.400 --> 38:53.520]  degradation we'd better break the change now because they're adding more
[38:53.520 --> 39:00.920]  chains every day this but an Indiana sheriff at Illinois gun great folks
[39:00.920 --> 39:07.200]  I've written this op-ed piece for us Indiana sheriff house to house random
[39:07.200 --> 39:11.840]  searches now possible and it's got reports links to his reports and his
[39:11.840 --> 39:18.000]  press releases and they're openly saying now they can do door-to-door gun
[39:18.000 --> 39:25.120]  sweeps and that's two years ago we had the army kernel on regular army big army
[39:25.120 --> 39:32.320]  on from Iowa in Arcadia and it was in the local paper it said the local gun
[39:32.320 --> 39:37.080]  shop owner has agreed to play the part of an American terrorist and we're gonna
[39:37.080 --> 39:41.480]  raid his gun shop and then we're gonna search citizens homes for guns
[39:41.480 --> 39:47.720]  we're gonna barricade and blockade the town of 700 and we're going to search
[39:47.720 --> 39:57.800]  every home and the citizens have agreed to let us go into their homes and they're
[39:57.800 --> 40:01.240]  doing these drills everywhere I mean they're really trying to run the
[40:01.240 --> 40:06.160]  military men and women through these drills to where they just get normalized
[40:06.160 --> 40:12.240]  and go well I've I've done this drill and you know 15s 20 times and they drill
[40:12.240 --> 40:17.400]  the military National Guard regular full-time military with police all over
[40:17.400 --> 40:21.600]  we have countless newscasts we've linked to on the website where local news is
[40:21.600 --> 40:26.120]  saying how great it is and the role players are constitutionalist and they
[40:26.120 --> 40:31.920]  practice killing us I mean this criminal government is in full-scale at least
[40:31.920 --> 40:37.600]  20-year preparation for all-out war and now it's they hit the afterburners I
[40:37.600 --> 40:43.760]  mean it it it's increased the last two years by a magnitude of about a dead
[40:43.760 --> 40:51.280]  wreck in 20 times I mean it's an exponential jump and I've told folks
[40:51.280 --> 40:55.040]  this years ago I might get chills once a year when I looked at an article or
[40:55.040 --> 40:59.040]  covered something I'm getting chills every five minutes on this show now I
[40:59.040 --> 41:04.160]  mean look the hair standing up on my arm because at an instinctive level just
[41:04.160 --> 41:08.160]  like when you're brought to the edge of a cliff my body's going whoa my guts are
[41:08.160 --> 41:13.680]  going whoa something big is on and they positioned us for this economic collapse
[41:13.680 --> 41:17.320]  all along and they're going to stage terror attacks to blame them on
[41:17.320 --> 41:20.720]  domestic groups we even have White House memos advising how great a
[41:20.720 --> 41:24.160]  domestic terror attack would be how it would help the president and they are
[41:24.160 --> 41:28.440]  clearly getting ready to try to use their internet takeover switches all of
[41:28.440 --> 41:35.440]  it they are moving towards this and with it is a lot of people think well I'll
[41:35.440 --> 41:38.720]  just stay out of this and I'll be all right folks this is about taking your
[41:38.720 --> 41:43.160]  pension funds public and private is now being pushed openly by both parties
[41:43.160 --> 41:49.680]  it's about totally devaluing your dollar it's about just the total collapse of
[41:49.680 --> 41:54.800]  society and remember major university studies show that the 10 years of the
[41:54.800 --> 41:59.720]  Great Depression more than 7 million people starved to death or died from
[41:59.720 --> 42:03.320]  complications of malnutrition and that's when 90% of the country lived on
[42:03.320 --> 42:08.480]  farms and was somewhat self-sufficient 10% live in rural areas now or farms half
[42:08.480 --> 42:15.800]  of those are self-sufficient now there is a middle-class flight it's
[42:15.800 --> 42:18.760]  predominantly white but there's also a lot of other folks who are middle class
[42:18.760 --> 42:23.600]  and educated who know history and they are running I can't tell you you go out
[42:23.600 --> 42:33.040]  to these towns around Austin it's doctors it's lawyers it's it's psychologist
[42:33.040 --> 42:39.440]  psychiatrist it's former military officers and you walk into any little
[42:39.440 --> 42:43.960]  store and every person comes up to me a lot of them who previously didn't know
[42:43.960 --> 42:48.960]  who I was and years ago moved out to these towns and they know full well
[42:48.960 --> 42:53.440]  historically what's coming and it was more reports in Russia and more reports
[42:53.440 --> 42:59.400]  in the US where bunker building quietly in the bottom of houses in the wealthy
[42:59.400 --> 43:05.040]  particularly former government people is just off the charts why why are they
[43:05.040 --> 43:10.560]  wire is every major police department basically hardening their facilities
[43:10.560 --> 43:18.000]  this is all men planned and I am so sad for everybody because it's going to be
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.480]  rough now if we were able to have a big enough political awakening in this
[43:22.480 --> 43:28.400]  country and and really stood down the globalist and used alternative media
[43:28.400 --> 43:31.520]  while we've still got time to let them know that we're aware of what they're
[43:31.520 --> 43:38.320]  doing and checkmate them they may back off but the globalist are masters at
[43:38.320 --> 43:44.480]  committing their forces betting it all in double downing and they they pretty
[43:44.480 --> 43:48.680]  much have already put this collapse into motion it's very hard for them to pull
[43:48.680 --> 43:55.240]  out of it and so they create a political atmosphere where things are going to
[43:55.240 --> 44:00.840]  break down so bad that there'll be riots in many cities cities will burn
[44:00.840 --> 44:06.800]  sections of cities will burn and you will want the military on the streets see
[44:06.800 --> 44:13.880]  that their masters at setting the table setting the dominoes where you'll
[44:13.880 --> 44:20.160]  actually want them to do it and then they'll actually come in and do a good
[44:20.160 --> 44:25.040]  job of shutting things down shutting riots down that are just looting you
[44:25.040 --> 44:31.360]  know behavior of destitute welfare folks and others and that's what they've done
[44:31.360 --> 44:35.360]  in countless third world countries it's in the 112 point IMF World Bank shock
[44:35.360 --> 44:39.600]  doctrine plan how they implode it at the first level riots start because of no
[44:39.600 --> 44:44.520]  food and because of prices going up under hyperinflation then they come in and
[44:44.520 --> 44:49.360]  crack down and the middle class has no choice but to basically go with the
[44:49.360 --> 44:56.760]  establishment I mean it's all been socially engineered out okay and it's
[44:56.760 --> 45:01.120]  the end of America it is everybody can see it you can feel it you can know it
[45:01.120 --> 45:06.120]  and there's some different wildcards though a lot of people are still self
[45:06.120 --> 45:10.560]  sufficient there's so much stored up old wealth in the middle class there's
[45:10.560 --> 45:14.520]  guns there's a lot of counties and cities that are under the control of real
[45:14.520 --> 45:17.960]  Americans still there's a lot of people in the military and the police
[45:17.960 --> 45:22.200]  establishment and the bureaucracy to understand what's happening we're not
[45:22.200 --> 45:31.240]  going to be as easy as Mexico or Brazil or Nigeria or Indonesia it is not going
[45:31.240 --> 45:36.200]  to be as easy now the system is going to stage terror attacks and they're getting
[45:36.200 --> 45:39.840]  ready with the preparatory phase with 60 minutes all the other shows saying
[45:39.840 --> 45:42.640]  those that don't like the Federal Reserve or cop killers look out they're
[45:42.640 --> 45:46.000]  gonna blow stuff up Oklahoma City is coming so they're already prescripting
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.640]  with the soccer moms and folks hey there's McVeigh's everywhere they're
[45:49.640 --> 45:54.280]  about to bomb you show that as the real Americans as this implosion accelerates
[45:54.280 --> 45:59.960]  stand up and get more credibility 90% of warfare is psychological the globalists
[45:59.960 --> 46:05.280]  have no qualms they're beyond evil they will trigger events knowing we've got
[46:05.280 --> 46:09.560]  the moral high ground to be blamed on us and you need to understand it's not the
[46:09.560 --> 46:13.400]  helicopters the tanks most the people in the helicopters and tanks are on our
[46:13.400 --> 46:18.160]  side and that's evidenced by the different surveys that have been done
[46:18.160 --> 46:21.680]  will you fire on Americans evidence by Ron Paul getting the most political
[46:21.680 --> 46:26.920]  contributions of anybody affect the majority from serving military last
[46:26.920 --> 46:34.320]  cycle it's already starting up this time the problem is that see I can get in the
[46:34.320 --> 46:39.000]  globalist mindset if you study warfare theory you've got to study the enemy's
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.640]  operations their tricks what's worked best for them you've got to become them
[46:42.640 --> 46:47.560]  and that's how I can become the enemy in my mind war game from their position I
[46:47.560 --> 46:52.240]  do this when I'm driving I do this when I lay at bed at night then I can tell
[46:52.240 --> 46:54.880]  exactly what they'll do and I'm not giving them ideas they've done this
[46:54.880 --> 46:59.200]  before they'll stage massacres of cops military to try to really get them
[46:59.200 --> 47:03.680]  fired up well we'll get those patriots they like to target federal buildings
[47:03.680 --> 47:11.240]  that'll have a daycare in them that's what Oklahoma City was chosen and that's
[47:11.240 --> 47:14.120]  what came out this horn after David's McVeigh who thought he was setting up
[47:14.120 --> 47:18.280]  patriots got mad when they picked one of the daycare center and threw a fit went
[47:18.280 --> 47:22.040]  rogue and they definitely then decided if he wasn't already the patsy that he was
[47:22.040 --> 47:24.400]  the guy they were gonna burn at that point when he said I'm not gonna blow up
[47:24.400 --> 47:29.320]  kids they said well you just don't get this do you pal of course Operation
[47:29.320 --> 47:35.560]  Gladio in Italy in the 70s and early 80s declassified CIA ran stage bombings of
[47:35.560 --> 47:38.520]  school buses and things like that because there's nothing better on a
[47:38.520 --> 47:44.800]  newscast than some bloody kids and a fireman's arms so we outnumber the
[47:44.800 --> 47:51.040]  globalist hundreds to one conservatively but they still can play the dirty tricks
[47:51.040 --> 47:57.760]  and the public is still somewhat naive enough to buy it and I just want you to
[47:57.760 --> 48:02.600]  understand what we're going into and I want you to know what's happening there
[48:02.600 --> 48:08.320]  are some reels ultra low-intensity attacks that are carried out always by
[48:08.320 --> 48:15.200]  people who have been assessed by the government psychologist on staff at the
[48:15.200 --> 48:18.840]  prisons then when they're released they'll even release them early they
[48:18.840 --> 48:23.440]  have a handler that comes in and tries to trick the low IQ mentally ill person
[48:23.440 --> 48:27.720]  to go out and try to bomb something but they're so stupid that they're never
[48:27.720 --> 48:31.400]  ever really to carry out a big attack and that's even come out last year in
[48:31.400 --> 48:34.920]  the news the FBI and eight different cases set up people created the groups
[48:34.920 --> 48:38.520]  tried to get them to carry out attacks but they're so dumb they can't generally
[48:38.520 --> 48:45.760]  that's why the globalists will have to go with real attacks or they'll hire a
[48:45.760 --> 48:49.560]  fence group you know that they'll fence it through a group like the weathermen
[48:49.560 --> 48:52.000]  which later came out were government operatives that's why Bill Clinton
[48:52.000 --> 48:57.040]  pardoned even some of the patsies who had bombed police stations and things
[48:57.040 --> 49:03.160]  like that and killed cops and blinded cops I mean just look at these headlines
[49:03.160 --> 49:08.040]  today Bill Clinton calls for internet ministry of truth for a government
[49:08.040 --> 49:12.720]  agency to counter internet lies and be able to shut down websites in the US
[49:12.720 --> 49:18.400]  Bill Clinton will tell us what the truth is he's so truthful and Ron Paul says
[49:18.400 --> 49:23.320]  US may try to occupy Pakistan well absolutely that's that's ongoing
[49:23.320 --> 49:30.280]  bin Laden's latest audio tape praises globalist engineered fake revolutions
[49:30.280 --> 49:35.920]  and I was just watching Obama at a press conference during the last break he
[49:35.920 --> 49:41.880]  said the people are rising up against tyranny rising up for their rights in
[49:41.880 --> 49:51.880]  these Arab nations and in Syria in Libya and in Egypt in every case it's now
[49:51.880 --> 49:55.720]  admitted that these groups the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda affiliated
[49:55.720 --> 50:01.840]  groups were openly funded by the State Department and sent in and here's the
[50:01.840 --> 50:08.040]  the latest bin Laden tape that they got from the rat hole supposedly and it's
[50:08.040 --> 50:13.200]  praising the revolutions and then they've been proven to release all these
[50:13.200 --> 50:17.560]  fake audio tapes and video tapes before but just magically it praises it now
[50:17.560 --> 50:22.280]  giving it the Al Qaeda seal of approval for these groups so the globalist can
[50:22.280 --> 50:27.000]  even stir up a horde of organic people to basically use like patsies against
[50:27.000 --> 50:33.360]  others and so here's bin Laden and Obama agreeing with each other and saying
[50:33.360 --> 50:40.040]  how great these revolutions are and how great freedom fighters they are and how
[50:40.040 --> 50:45.040]  it needs to be supported so bin Laden saying oh you're great and so is Obama
[50:45.040 --> 50:51.600]  Obama saying oh you're great and there's now Intel coming out that they may use
[50:51.600 --> 50:55.440]  their Taliban Al Qaeda groups in Pakistan to try to overthrow that
[50:55.440 --> 51:00.280]  government kind of like they used them in 53 against the Iranians you got a
[51:00.280 --> 51:03.880]  lot of low friends this is Alex Jones the earthquake tsunami and nuclear
[51:03.880 --> 51:08.080]  disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to
[51:08.080 --> 51:11.800]  the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the
[51:11.800 --> 51:15.920]  United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless all
[51:15.920 --> 51:20.120]  caused by the devalued US dollar all the mainstream media continues to ignore

[53:07.680 --> 53:11.280]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or
[53:11.280 --> 53:14.640]  gold it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this
[53:14.640 --> 53:18.440]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at

[54:22.600 --> 54:29.480]  here's another psychological warfare example the headline reads panic at
[54:29.480 --> 54:35.480]  Minnesota Airport when TSA conducts drill and doesn't tell police or other
[54:35.480 --> 54:39.800]  headlines panic at high school when police don't tell teachers or students
[54:39.800 --> 54:45.000]  it's a hostage-taking drill they don't ever want to announce these to create
[54:45.000 --> 54:48.880]  the psychological fear and the perception in the community that they're a real
[54:48.880 --> 54:55.720]  terrorist threatening you okay and I was just watching more of Obama's speech
[54:55.720 --> 55:05.280]  this ongoing every time Bush or Obama is is is launching a new anti-terror
[55:05.280 --> 55:12.080]  initiative Al Qaeda releases text or videos or generally audio agreeing with
[55:12.080 --> 55:16.360]  whatever they're saying agreeing with global warming being real saying how
[55:16.360 --> 55:22.320]  great the rebels are that are globalist backed going along with the official
[55:22.320 --> 55:27.600]  story just like Al Qaeda came out on a message board oh somebody said on a
[55:27.600 --> 55:33.240]  message board that bin Laden is dead and it's true and just like Obama said it's
[55:33.240 --> 55:39.640]  all true I mean it's so ridiculous and then I get emails and I see comments on
[55:39.640 --> 55:46.840]  our YouTube videos saying oh Alex what do you gotta say now you're discredited Al
[55:46.840 --> 55:52.640]  Qaeda has come out admitted he's dead oh really on a message board really I mean I
[55:52.640 --> 55:56.000]  could go on some Arabic message board and say that I was Santa Claus and that I
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.880]  admit to coming down people's chimneys at night is the associated press gonna
[55:59.880 --> 56:07.000]  run with headlines with it and coming up in the next hour ahead of our guest I'm
[56:07.000 --> 56:16.480]  gonna spend a lot of time on the economy I'm gonna spend a lot of time on Iran
[56:16.480 --> 56:22.360]  and Pakistan and the fact that more and more the Pentagon is moving towards a
[56:22.360 --> 56:27.040]  full-out occupation of Pakistan Ron Paul's now warning that's the scuttle
[56:27.040 --> 56:31.960]  button Congress that video and press releases up on present planet calm and
[56:31.960 --> 56:37.200]  fullworks.com Ron Paul US may try to occupy Pakistan but speaking of hoaxes
[56:37.200 --> 56:43.720]  this is a classic tactic the media will come out and say everyone knows Alex
[56:43.720 --> 56:49.800]  Jones is discredited or everyone knows Ron Paul's discredited everyone know
[56:49.800 --> 56:57.680]  everyone knows the moon is made of Swiss cheese an Esquire which I've noticed
[56:57.680 --> 57:02.880]  is the particular mouthpiece of the White House for democratic White Houses
[57:02.880 --> 57:08.240]  attacking people and putting out this info breaking Jerome Corsi's birther
[57:08.240 --> 57:12.880]  book pulled from shelves and they put this out yesterday one of their news
[57:12.880 --> 57:18.920]  reporters breaking politics section saying that Joseph Farrah had cussed out
[57:18.920 --> 57:22.920]  Dr. Jerome Corsi that he called all the bookstores and said recall them
[57:22.920 --> 57:27.160]  voluntarily send them back to me I'm having them destroyed contact WorldNet
[57:27.160 --> 57:32.320]  Daily will give you your money back which is a form of economic warfare on one
[57:32.320 --> 57:35.720]  front trying to bankrupt the hundreds of thousands of copies that are out there
[57:35.720 --> 57:39.520]  by the way selling quite well to create the illusion and the idea that it's
[57:39.520 --> 57:42.760]  being recalled so that it's that discredited thing this is targeting
[57:42.760 --> 57:45.280]  people that aren't really paying attention and the news picked it up for a
[57:45.280 --> 57:51.840]  few hours all book recall discredited that's like the New York Post saying
[57:51.840 --> 57:55.320]  Jesse Ventura had backed off of his claim that bin Laden been dead for years
[57:55.320 --> 57:59.240]  we got Ventura on he said I never said that where's the source there was no
[57:59.240 --> 58:04.280]  source this is thinking of you as an idiot this is insulting your
[58:04.280 --> 58:08.400]  intelligence and so it's meant to bankrupt them it's meant to create the
[58:08.400 --> 58:11.400]  illusion that they're discredited and Farrah came out and said this is
[58:11.400 --> 58:16.240]  absolutely made up and he's gonna have to sue them now he has to he's been
[58:16.240 --> 58:24.240]  economically damaged big time he's got to get his honor and they panicked
[58:24.240 --> 58:29.600]  yesterday evening after this being up all day are up for a long time and and
[58:29.600 --> 58:36.920]  came out and said it's satire see that's because the White House is scared of
[58:36.920 --> 58:41.000]  this birth certificate issue we're gonna break it down
[58:43.280 --> 58:49.760]  this is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio Network
[58:49.760 --> 58:55.800]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[58:55.800 --> 59:00.400]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[59:00.400 --> 59:04.400]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I've
[59:04.400 --> 59:09.000]  turned members influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[59:09.000 --> 59:13.640]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[59:13.640 --> 59:18.000]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[59:18.000 --> 59:23.280]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[59:23.280 --> 59:27.560]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[59:27.560 --> 59:31.080]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[59:31.080 --> 59:36.320]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[59:36.320 --> 59:42.320]  have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at

[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:46.440]  based on the 1967 borders that's just talk to get the new Arab Spring movement
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:51.760]  to somehow link up with the globalist and the Al Qaeda forces they've got that
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:57.600]  are the head of these movements on record very complex developments on that

[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:09.960]  coming up here's the headline Obama Palestinian state must be based on 1967
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:16.960]  borders continuing officials exploit Indy 500 to roll out new federal alert system
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.880]  Indiana is one of their big beta test states I've always pointed that out they
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:24.720]  were the first that I know of more than 15 years ago or right around 15 years ago
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:30.120]  to have a license plate reading cameras up that was a not classified but not
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:34.560]  public information when I discovered it I know the folks that have said there's
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:38.240]  absolutely no fourth amendment and it's actually a bad thing so you got some
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:46.640]  real hardcore death spots up there okay good people though in Indiana but they
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:53.800]  definitely have an out-of-control government okay let me get in to the
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:58.760]  whole birth certificate situation I want to be clear I shot a special report on
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.560]  this last night will be up the next few hours ten minute reported in full wars
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:07.320]  dot com and prison planet dot com and I haven't developed the title yet the
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:10.280]  special video report but I'll be able to give that to you by the end of the
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:17.560]  broadcast coming up here an hour and 50 minutes from now but I want to be clear
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:23.640]  I was criticized three years ago when the whole birth or controversy began
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:28.160]  before the media even gave it a name to try to criticize it I had Tarpleon who
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:31.520]  had questions because I respected him and I had Phil Bergon because I respected
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:36.760]  him this is when Obama hadn't even gotten the nomination yet because I knew
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:40.640]  they were guys who had integrity and did real research and I interviewed him a
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:44.840]  little bit but I actually got criticized because I didn't commit to it I
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:49.600]  didn't say that I think there's total proof and I think he was born in Kenya I
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:54.480]  should look my issue is Obama is the guy getting all the Wall Street money he
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.800]  says all his advisors are these globalists he's gonna continue what
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:01.640]  Bush did but it's gonna give left cover to it so the left's gonna go to sleep
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.880]  he's gonna support torture secret arrest new wars I knew that because of who his
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:10.040]  advisors were I started making the Obama deception when he was president elect
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:19.280]  in November and it was released about a month after he was in office in in March
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:25.480]  he got in in January 22nd it was released March 13th a little bit about a
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:31.920]  month or so a month and a half after he got in and I and I covered the issues I
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:37.440]  covered the facts it's it's it's not that I'm ashamed when the media calls me a
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:42.880]  birther it's just not accurate to say I'm whole hog committed I'm somebody who
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:48.280]  made two films about Obama accurately predicted in the first film exactly what
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:53.360]  he would do it with with stunning prescience but it's not prescience it's
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:57.840]  it's knowing the globalist program and then who his advisors are and then what
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:04.080]  the agenda is I mean it's like if I'm driving down I 35 and I'm going driving
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:08.760]  through Temple and Waco I know in 70 80 miles I'm gonna hit Georgetown and then
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:12.640]  Austin I mean it's I'm following what they're doing it it's really not that
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:19.800]  hard that's what's so frustrating about this but to make a long story short three
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:26.520]  years ago I thought it was a distraction and but out of hundreds and hundreds of
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:32.040]  broadcasts we did I did maybe five or six on it and got a lot of criticism you've
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:35.160]  heard the calls how dare you not be covering a birth certificate how dare
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:39.280]  you not be in and I'm just like look I think it's suspicious Nixon lied
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:46.160]  Clinton lied Bush senior read my lips I mean they lie Clinton bombed aspirin
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:54.840]  factories to divert people from Monica Lewinsky I get it but I've got areas I
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:13:03.240]  can prove 100% that they're lying and so why should I go with this but over time
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:08.240]  I did more research it some of his records came out from Indonesia he was
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:12.160]  Barry Cetero on there he was listed by the government as Barry Cetero that
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:15.720]  means he had to give up his citizenship the rest of the records have been blocked
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:21.120]  they're all secretive about his college records and high school records and no
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:26.040]  one remembered him as a child a little boy in Hawaii and his mother's got this
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:30.440]  weird CIA history and it's not just Barry Cetero there's this other Indonesian
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:35.280]  name on records that we do have and then the White House spent over two million
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:39.120]  fighting to release records and one of the biggest issues was they released that
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:44.560]  that receipt of a certificate that anybody can go to the health department
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:50.560]  and and get a print off of and it's simply saying that the Bureau of Vital
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:56.000]  Statistics federally says that there is a filing of a record for a birth
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.680]  certificate for that person and the media said this is the birth certificate
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:04.440]  there is no such thing as a long form this is made up they're lying this is
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:08.400]  the original and everybody simple minds got doctors signatures on it and all
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:12.240]  these boxes and the weight and the mother and the father and all this stuff
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:18.760]  that's not what it is they said shut up that's it for two years plus I thought
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:24.160]  well that's suspicious and then of course these books coming out you've got
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:32.360]  this big democratic operative out there saying what people want to hear pro
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:37.400]  socialist health care in the past pro imminent domain big globalist casino
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:43.560]  owner I mean give me a break folks that's mob Donald Trump and he's out
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:48.360]  there running around and brings up this issue and then right after he quote gets
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:51.960]  discredited when the fake birth certificate comes out he then cusses a
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:55.760]  bunch knowing that'll discredit him he's an actor and I came out and pointed
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:01.440]  that out at the time and since then what Monday he dropped out but he is a good
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.560]  actor he was almost convincing me he was gonna run for a while my gut at first
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:07.920]  said this is all a publicity stunt it turns out I've always got to go with my
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:15.400]  gut but I've set the table with that background I don't know if this is a
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:21.440]  giant Psyop or or whether he was wasn't born in Hawaii or his real birth
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:25.760]  certificate has a different father listed and Wayne Madsen was high-level
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:32.720]  NSA everything he's told me has ended up being true and he won't give me his
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:37.360]  sources but he's quite a character in person hung out with him a lot when he
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:42.040]  was here for two days he said the word is he he was here and said the day
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:46.360]  before the birth certificate came out he said no he was born in Hawaii there's a
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:51.800]  different father and then off air he said well I can't really give the source
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:57.560]  or give more details because it will give up the source and I'm in a day later
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:01.600]  it they released the birth certificate and Madsen predicted they would do that
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:04.920]  as well and now of course he's saying he was told three weeks before that they
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:09.400]  were I had sources saying they were getting ready to very high level in DC
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:13.400]  and Chicago even had callers saying the same thing with their media sources in
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:17.320]  Chicago who were in medias because these folks these folks talk people say well
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:21.520]  something this big it would come out it does come out just like ships came back
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:24.800]  at her Gulf of Tonkin and said it was staged it was in the San Diego newspaper
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:28.360]  but then people forgot where they read it and it became an urban legend it
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:32.960]  wasn't an urban legend you know generally legends have some truth to them but
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:39.480]  continuing here either either they're putting this all out to make it a
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:45.000]  diversion and make the election about his eligibility because they know he
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.200]  really was born in America and they think this is something to to hype up
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:53.800]  because then people don't look at the torture the wars the lobbyist the banker
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:59.400]  insiders the Patriot Act all the things Democrats said they hated well if you if
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:04.800]  you hate what Obama's doing then you hated Bush but if you hated Bush on his
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:08.960]  policies and you're a Democrat you should you should hate Obama but but but
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.080]  if you love Bush you should love Obama if you're a mainline Republican because
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:20.040]  rhetoric's different but the actions are identical in the real world so either
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:26.040]  it's a Psyop to make this about this non-issue and there's some evidence
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:31.520]  towards that that came out from the White House yesterday or they are hiding
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:35.000]  something in his past and with the Indonesia stuff and the records being
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:41.600]  covered up and his CIA background I don't know but it's important and we're
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:47.320]  covering it because the system is pushing it out there for a reason and so
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:50.400]  we have to analyze it you know we didn't just spend two three weeks on bin
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:57.760]  Laden just because we knew that was a you know fake operation it's everything
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:01.120]  connected to why did they bring that out now domestically well it's for the
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.960]  reelection campaign he's going to run on killing bin Laden but it's also about
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:09.360]  hyping up new terror attacks and it's about framing Pakistan and having a
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:14.680]  pretext to occupy that country so see there's reasons they roll these things
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:20.280]  out it's what they matrix in and connect to it what are the spokes coming off
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:25.520]  from this it's why even though it's a propaganda event within the propaganda
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:30.600]  event is the riddle to understand the plan and the next phase so you have to
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:37.160]  get to study these very carefully now it blew over a few weeks ago a lot of
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:40.520]  pull-shed people still don't believe he was born here don't believe what he
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:43.760]  says because government's been caught lying so much in the past I mean if
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:47.800]  Nixon called Woodward and Bernstein and the start of watergate and said boys I
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:51.320]  didn't have people break into that hotel and they said that's good enough for us
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:56.480]  mr. president no I mean that's ridiculous you don't just buy and
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:00.640]  presidents were more trusted back in the 70s than they are now since when do we
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:04.840]  just oh you say there's WMDs in Iraq and turns out they lied for
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:11.920]  meditatively oh you say you were born in Hawaii you say you know all of these
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:17.520]  things they lie lie lie lie lie I mean think of all the lies read my lips no
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:23.440]  new taxes I didn't have sex with that woman Monica Lewinsky they're legion now
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:27.480]  something big happened multiple things happened yesterday and we're gonna
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:36.600]  cover when we come back because Esquire will lose a lawsuit I mean there's no
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:41.880]  doubt the world net daily gets the right lawyer this is economic espionage 101
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:46.200]  definitely is gonna damage world net daily as publishers it's definitely a
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:51.680]  hoax meant to damage the book and we're gonna cover when we come back and it
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:57.080]  shows total desperation and Esquire is a White House mouthpiece stay with us
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:02.240]  we're gonna break this down the other side concerned about radioactive fallout
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:05.880]  the number one way by which your body protects itself from radiation or any

[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:29.800]  with this new big controversy we got Dr. Corsi on tomorrow breaking Esquire
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:34.680]  reported Jerome Corsi's birther book pulled from the shelves one day after
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:39.360]  the release of weather where's the birth certificate the case that Barack Obama
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:43.160]  is not eligible to be president by Dr. Jerome Corsi world net daily editor and
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:47.240]  chief executive officer Joseph Farrah has announced plans to recall and pulp
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:51.680]  the entire 200,000 first printing run of the book as well as announcing an offer
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:56.200]  to refund the purchase price to anyone who has already bought either a hard
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:25:00.080]  copy or electronic download of the book now that's meant to just flood them
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:05.080]  through their merchant services and bank accounts with that people will then
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:09.640]  think it's been offered and get mad when it's not offered stores will get
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:14.160]  calls and walk-ins they will then pull it from the store shelves it's just
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:19.480]  totally criminal and and and this was not written in a satire section it was
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:25.800]  written in politics news section by Mark Warren just unbelievably vicious and
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:30.000]  again they do hit pieces for the wine house but this is a desperation move
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.280]  why if he's born in Hawaii this is a real birth certificate why worry because I
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:37.840]  don't know where he was born I don't want to talk about it but when he puts
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:43.880]  the fake out and it's just been oh my gosh the whole thing is fake I've gone
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:48.920]  over we got a video coming out a few hours breaking it down the kerning the
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:57.080]  computer changing it the typewriter letters being identical a typewriter
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:03.880]  strikes the ribbon and everyone is different even if it's the same e or a
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:08.600]  or z it's like a snowflake or a fingerprint the way it strikes the way
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:13.880]  the ink blobs around the edge when the metal strikes the ribbon anybody who's
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:17.720]  had a typewriter knows that but you blow it up they're identical this was done
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:24.680]  with a computer with I mean it was done to be fake to be discovered or they're
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:28.000]  just so desperate and they didn't want to have an agency do it because they
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.480]  thought folks might blackmail the white house with it and it might get leaked that
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:36.200]  they use somebody down the hall I don't know the point is it's fake it's fake
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:42.400]  it's fake there's no doubt this is so crazy and so they had this article and
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.560]  it goes out and says in an exclusive interview a reflective Farah who wrote
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:52.720]  the books forward I mean they say they interviewed him a reflective Farah who
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:56.080]  wrote the books forward and also published course these earlier best-selling
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:03.120]  work unfit for command swift boat veterans speaking out against John Kerry and it
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:06.880]  goes on I believe with all my heart that Barack Obama is destroying this
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:10.400]  country and I will continue to stand against his administration at every turn
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:14.800]  but in light of recent events this book has become problematic and contains what
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:18.620]  I now believe to be factual inaccuracies he's speaking for him saying he
[01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:22.560]  interviewed him a journalist in a prestigious magazine he said this
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:27.360]  morning I cannot in good conscience publish it and expect anyone to believe
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:32.160]  it so that's like saying Alex Jones admitted he committed murder Alex Jones
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:37.800]  admits he lied all these years imagine you've sqr put an article and said we
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:42.440]  interviewed Alex Jones he admits he injects heroin he admits he's lied all
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:49.880]  these years he admits he tortures little dogs I mean I mean they are saying they
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:52.480]  interviewed the publisher who's printed hundreds of thousands of these
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:57.560]  millions in investment this could destroy him and they say it's being pulled
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:03.200]  they want to refund your money we talked to him and it goes on I mean Esquire did
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:07.720]  this ladies and gentlemen and then hours and hours later after national news
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:12.640]  picked it up then they add that it's satire at the bottom not even at the
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:17.440]  top now here's the world that daily article national mag publishes fabricated
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:21.640]  report attacking coursey book Esquire claims bestseller being disavowed by
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:25.640]  publisher pulled from shelves just unbelievable economic sabotage I mean
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:30.640]  that is espionage your economic sabotage that's what espionage is boys and
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:37.840]  girls now continuing what else came out yesterday ABC news talking to the
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:45.680]  White House they're going to sell made of America t-shirts running on the fact
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:52.040]  that the birthers are discredited so so instead of running on the fact that
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:55.400]  Obama's lied about everything and is incredibly corrupt and that the economy's
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:29:01.880]  falling apart instead that they're going to run ABC news reports on this so
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:05.120]  because they're going to run on it they've got to continue to attack the
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:08.760]  fact that it's a fake birth certificate part of the reason for the shirts a
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:13.280]  campaign official till ABC news is the despite the president's release last
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:16.680]  month the long-form birth certificate I thought there wasn't one of those in
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:20.640]  existence and they didn't exist remember see the the previous lies like we're
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:24.920]  idiots and don't know there's a long form conservative fact-checking author
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:28.920]  Jerome Corsi's book where's the birth certificate the case of the Barack
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:33.080]  Obama is not eligible to be president was published last week and it goes on
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:38.160]  just to say the White House is basically gonna run on the birth certificate
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:45.440]  issue and so they've come out with an announcement saying that Corsi and
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:49.920]  Farah have pled guilty to being you know frauds when they didn't and Obama's the
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:55.080]  fraud the birth certificate the fraud on the March the Empire's on the run Alex

[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:35.720]  Reagan here in a moment just briefly finishing up with the birth certificate
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:39.640]  I've not been a birther in the three years this has been out I have interviewed
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:43.360]  some guests I've looked at it they're definitely covering up Obama's past his
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:48.480]  mother's definitely CIA and above with the big foundations he definitely had the
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:53.360]  name Barry Cetero it's weird but the fact that they did release this new one
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:57.280]  and it's been analyzed and it's clearly been shown to be fake is amazing and
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:02.840]  dr. Jerome Corsi is on tomorrow and we've got that report up on prison
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:07.720]  planet dot com and info wars dot com birther bombshell Corsi to release
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:13.200]  evidence proving Obama's certificate as fraudulent a fraudulent composite we've

[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:28.040]  information and Joseph Ferris saying he's gonna sue Esquire now because it
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:31.160]  wasn't a parody they didn't say it was a parody they didn't add it with satire
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:34.360]  they came out in a serious report and said they interviewed Farron he was
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:38.920]  recalling the book and giving people's money back which is economic espionage
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:43.920]  and a serious serious attack which shows their desperate and ABC News reports the
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:46.800]  White House is now planning to run on the birth certificate issue and putting
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:53.600]  out campaign t-shirts to be sold to raise money so this this issue is not
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:57.280]  going away I wish it would because I want to look at the issues with Obama he
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:02.440]  might have been born on Mars for all I care at the end of the day this guy's
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:07.920]  continuing the neocon agenda will also get dr. Paul Craig Roberts take on
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:13.480]  Obama coming out and pushing all these revolutions and saying Israel needs to
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:21.640]  go back to its 67 borders Ron Paul's out saying that there is a move to try to
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:26.400]  occupy Pakistan I had general ghoul on a few days ago US helicopter attacked an
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:32.360]  emplacement over there it is it is certainly deteriorating very very
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:38.040]  quickly so that's all coming up now the main reason that we have dr. Paul Craig
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:43.320]  Roberts with us today is the whole Dominique Strauss con situation and in
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:52.680]  national polls in France fully 60% or higher the lowest poll 60% believe this
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:36:00.160]  is a setup con was set in polls to handily defeat and was going to be
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:05.040]  running as the leader of the socialist party against Nicholas Sarkozy who is a
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:09.840]  lapdog of the Anglo-American banking establishment I'm not saying Bilderberg
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:14.480]  group member cons a good guy he's a globalist one-worlder as well but it is
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:18.680]  suspicious that normally you know Al Gore any of these guys can get away with
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:25.680]  murder Bill Clinton Juanita Broderick all of it but then magically this happens so
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:29.440]  the whole thing is suspicious and he and Paul Craig Roberts as an article the
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:33.280]  Strauss con frame up the American police states strides forward so we'll cover
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:39.600]  that first then get his take on the whole OBL hoax he very eloquently a few
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:44.600]  weeks ago with Paul Watson broke down some of the glaring issues dr. Paul Craig
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:48.920]  Roberts thank you for joining us today hello Alex good to have you with us
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:53.360]  let's get into the Dominique Strauss con you seem pretty convinced here that
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:37:00.040]  there's some dirty shenanigans going on well I do I am because from the very
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:05.560]  beginning the police instead of doing as they are required to do and give a
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:11.040]  defendant the presumption of innocence immediately began painting a picture of
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:16.920]  a guilty man so from the very first announcement the police have been trying
[01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:24.680]  to come to paint his guilt all over him and it continues that way and so when
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:31.720]  you see that you it's pretty much a giveaway that they intend to convict
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:41.720]  and there's too many things wrong with the story and one of the most astounding
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:48.000]  things is that the way they found him is that when he got to the airport he
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:54.760]  realized he had left a cell phone and call the hotel it said I'm at John F.
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:38:00.080]  Kennedy Airport and I think I've left my cell phone and would you see if you can
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:07.160]  retrieve it now that doesn't go with the picture that the police put out of a
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:14.200]  rapist fleeing his crime and heading out of the country and that was also the
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:18.840]  reason he was denied bail the judge said oh he was he was fleeing the scene and
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:22.920]  had run on the plane and we caught him just in the nick of time well they
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:27.880]  didn't catch him he cough he called in and reported where he was so it doesn't
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:32.880]  really make much sense that if you were fleeing from a crime scene that you would
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:39.120]  then call the scene of the crime and tell them where you are so there's just so
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:48.000]  many things about it now we do know that he was expected to be able to defeat
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:53.560]  Nicholas Sarkozy for the presidency of France in this upcoming election and
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:59.760]  that Sarkozy is is America's guy we put him in there it was American money and
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:09.400]  influence and that another black mark against Strauss-Kahn is that he let the
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:15.520]  IMF issue a report recently that said that within five years China would have
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:21.280]  surpassed the United States as the world's leading economic power and now
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:29.120]  this hurts Washington's prestige and hurts its ability to bully people or
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:35.160]  that people say well if we can hold out long enough they'll lose their some of
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:41.920]  their power and and so this also is a mark against him and then I think a
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:48.000]  third mark is that he had scared the bankers because he speaks of the need
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:56.240]  to re-regulate the banking system which is run amok and he has also indicated
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:03.680]  that he was sympathetic with Joseph Stiglitz view that the IMF should cease
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:09.240]  to be a weapon that the rich use against the poor and that the kind of
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:16.040]  austerity programs that are imposed on poor people as in Greece today Ireland
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:22.320]  today in order to bail out Wall Street that just really doesn't fly and so
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:29.400]  there he had a whole number then of powerful enemies and had predicted
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:37.440]  prior to his departure for the United States that he thought Sarkozy would
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:43.360]  set him up with the rate charge now he didn't mean in America an American
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:48.840]  hotel he was thinking in France that he would be presented with this type of
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:56.600]  smear in order to reduce his standing in the polls yes sir let me add a caveat
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:02.600]  there I have BBC Daily Mail all the big French papers he was on record saying
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:06.840]  they could set me up in a car park claiming I raped a woman but but that's
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:12.120]  not even the big key I want you to speak to that and then this they admit that a
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:19.640]  campaign staffer of Sarkozy put out the tweet that he had been grabbed for
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:25.320]  raping this woman before it was even in the news yes and before he was even
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:29.000]  arrested and and now they backtrack and said well we got a call from one of our
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.800]  operatives in the hotel and it went further the head spin doctor and this
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:39.240]  is admitted right admits for Sarkozy the big national Carl Rove over there
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:44.720]  the equivalent of Carl Rove admits that he put this out before it was even known
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:51.000]  so whether he did it or not or maybe she enticed or who knows this is all red
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.880]  handed that that this was an intelligence operation yes I think that
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:42:03.040]  you're right I cited that report from the Daily Mail and from liberation in my
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:13.640]  column and it is clear that that is admitted somehow the operative for
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:21.000]  Sarkozy against Strauss-Kahn and you before the New York police made the
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:29.440]  announcement and so that of course is more giveaways so I think you know what
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:34.920]  I think you'll be you'll have a hard time getting out of it because if you look
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:40.360]  around you know the left wing will will want to get him because he's a rich white
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:46.320]  guy and the feminists will want to get him because they know that all men are
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:54.640]  always raping women and they're just so many people that getting him is emotional
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:43:00.360]  satisfaction it goes along with their agendas and emotional needs he's got a
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:08.400]  hard time and it's quite clear too to add to your point Alex that if he was
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:14.200]  actually serving the system that he wouldn't touch him he would actually be
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:19.320]  able to rape somebody in broad daylight and get away with it in front of
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:27.120]  witnesses so clearly he was seen as a as a threat and he would just like
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:33.560]  Elliot Spitzer and was eliminated he was a threat to not just the banks but I
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:41.720]  mentioned to a wide variety of powerful interests and the fact that such a powerful
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:49.160]  figure was destroyed indicates that he was seen as a threat not as a servant
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:58.280]  of the system it definitely shows that there's a rift between the IMF and
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:03.800]  World Bank definitely illustrates that there is a fight going on right now and
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:08.880]  we saw Merkel last year call the big private banks like JP Morgan and others
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:12.960]  you know crooks they're trying to implode Europe they're trying to implode the
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:16.640]  United States they're completely predatory I don't think at the end of
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:23.240]  the day Dominic Strauss Kahn is an angel but at the same time I clearly some
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:29.040]  branches of the ruling class realize that that this predatory imploding of
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:33.400]  economies to consolidate them will end up killing the goose that lays the golden
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:39.800]  eggs now that's that's it of course there's no doubt that the man is Randy
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:48.440]  and and likes the companionship of women and that of course is also being used
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:56.800]  against him and I think that you know even among the Soviet Communist Party a
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:04.400]  social conscience developed among some members leading to reforms and collapse
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:11.360]  and so I wouldn't be surprised that there are people in the IMF who've had
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:17.200]  enough of squeezing and trampling the poor at some point some people are
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:23.800]  affected by that and and reform themselves and there is perhaps a struggle
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:30.440]  going on in the IMF but I suspect that's now over because what this it's not just
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:37.960]  the arrest it's the way he is is pronounced to be guilty before any
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:45.960]  evidence is in I mean no one's seen the maid we assume she exists and who else
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:54.680]  wants to take on that role and be faced with similar treatment so it's it's a
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:46:01.920]  huge warning shot to reform us to shut up and get back in line or you'll be
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:10.960]  next expanding on that it certainly sends a message across the board and we
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:15.000]  dovetail it with the Indiana Supreme Court ruling last week and I read the
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:24.240]  judges statement in the in the winning ruling saying police can now enter your
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:30.360]  home for any reason including no reason at all that's a quote and the U.S.
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:33.680]  Supreme Court said they can listen at your door do they hear sounds that could
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:38.000]  be hiding drugs ruffling or any sounds at all they can come in without warrants
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:44.880]  and they're now announcing yes we're gonna continue to expand sneaking peaks
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:48.960]  and non-terror related and that now even local jurisdictions are using and
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:53.400]  outside of the feds I mean it's just a complete abolition of everything and
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:47:02.000]  you see whether Khan is guilty or innocent if he's not given due process he
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:07.120]  has to be set free better ten guilty men go free than one innocent man go to
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:11.120]  prison that's always been the maximum of liberty and common sense and there is a
[01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:16.000]  war a conscious war I have an Indiana sheriff saying we're now going to do
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  door-to-door gun searches of homes we no longer need warrants that they're
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:28.480]  announcing their their their their their their avarice filled tyrant filled desire
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:34.040]  to run wild over this dr. Roberts yes fourth amendments gone in fact you know
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:38.680]  look Alex this is the subject of my book tearing of good intentions that went
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:43.600]  through two additions and a number of pronix that we've lost the protection
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:48.360]  of law the constitutional amendments that can comprise the bill of rights are
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:54.720]  simply eroded and you I'm sure you're aware that of the recent reports from
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:48:02.080]  Tennessee television stations about the police in Tennessee stopping traffic on
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:07.280]  I-40 and taking everybody's money on the grounds that if you have cash it's an
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:14.400]  indication that you just sold drugs and that's drug money and the reports are
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:19.840]  that the various police jurisdictions are almost coming to blows between
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:26.000]  themselves over who gets to disrupt this traffic and take the money and one of
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.880]  the small jurisdictions has already seized one million dollars from motorists
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:35.760]  and they go out there and just have blanket traffic stops and go through
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:41.800]  people's wallets take their money this is happening right now and and I can
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:45.920]  remember in my book I tell the case of when this was happening in Florida a
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:52.120]  number of years ago so you're right to play there's there's really no
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:57.720]  restrictions any longer own police what they do if they're unaccountable and
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:05.280]  there's no real inclination to hold them accountable the the conservative war on
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:12.480]  crime has unleashed police and created a monster and it's very interesting that
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:18.280]  the Supreme Court by an eight to one vote gave even more power to the police
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:24.240]  powers that you you just described because they can say oh we heard somebody
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:29.840]  flushing the toilet so that meant the drugs were going down the toilet so we
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:36.440]  had the right to bust in so there's no longer any constraints and people just
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:41.480]  seem to be at ease with this they don't seem to be and now they're announcing
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:47.560]  the austerity in Europe they're going after private pension funds a hundred
[01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:51.920]  percent your money they're now telling us to get rid of and and cut the public
[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:56.160]  pension funds here but but but don't stop any of the banker bailouts or
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:00.360]  corporate welfare we're going into austerity the ruling class knows they've
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:03.880]  committed all these crimes and they've decided to protect themselves and
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:09.360]  continue on by consciously setting up a police state how do we counter this I
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:16.600]  don't I don't really know Alex but you're certainly right that's what's
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:21.240]  happening look can you remember a decade or two back that they the junk bond
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:27.280]  king Michael milkin yeah well he had done absolutely nothing no everyone
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:32.520]  thinks he was convicted of insider trading that's false that was the rumor
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:35.720]  that Julia honey stay there stay there dr. Roberts we're gonna come right back

[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:20.160]  look folks if you're amazed by our decline into absolute despotism don't be
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:26.280]  the founders pointed it out it's historical fact tyranny is the norm and
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:30.560]  we're gonna get a particularly nasty version of tyranny because we're so
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:35.280]  naive because we're Americans and it can't happen here I mean the police
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:38.920]  don't secretly all over the country take a hundred bucks a thousand bucks out
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:44.320]  of your wallet just with no drugs no arrest they publicly do it public
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:48.520]  schools don't watch kids at home over their government laptops in the shower
[01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:54.560]  in the bed secretly they brag about it the TSA doesn't secretly stick their
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:59.320]  hands down your child's pants they do it publicly so there's an open breaking of
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:03.600]  the will happening but I see a huge awakening happening and tyranny will
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:09.960]  just continue until it finally collapses dr. roberts in closing always great to
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:13.520]  have you appreciate your wonderful articles you write for info wars.com
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:17.680]  and prisonpunna.com and thousands of other great sites out there and your
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:21.200]  tireless dedication to liberty I was on vacation for a couple days been
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:25.440]  listening to you while on the Texas beach with Paul Watson just laying out
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:29.160]  the bin Laden situation we've only got about three minutes left any other
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:34.440]  points on that subject yes Alex you know a very important point is that there's
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:38.960]  been no White House ceremony with the president conveying medals on these
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:44.880]  heroic seals who captured and killed the world's most dangerous men now what
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:52.040]  president would miss a public relations opportunity like that it's just
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:57.080]  unbelievable or the body or throwing it in the ocean or a photo yes of course
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:02.840]  but we've already covered that mention that but this this is something I'm not
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:07.640]  seeing anyone say anything about and I didn't stick it in my columns but
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:15.400]  surely with the seals triumphant return they would have been awarded medals in
[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:20.760]  the White House by the president before a national TV audience and they would
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:24.120]  have retired that group of seals they say well they're so secretive in their
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:28.120]  missions you can't see him he would have least had the secret ceremony with them
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:31.360]  being brought in and then coming out and thanking them oh it's it's unbelievable
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:38.160]  yes and they wouldn't he would sacrifice the seals for the publicity oh yeah yeah
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:42.760]  now some people say oh well they had to hide the seals because these brave men
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:48.680]  would be marked by Al Qaeda and terminate really I really believe that Al
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:56.360]  Qaeda is gonna penetrate the bases and get the seals but I think that is another
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:01.240]  giveaway now you may know as well that recently the Pakistani news
[01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:07.040]  agency the equivalent to the BBC and backstand put out a news report from
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:13.880]  eyewitnesses whom they identified and had speaking on camera that there were
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:18.240]  three helicopters only one landed and 12 people got out when the house came back
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:22.960]  and the people got in the helicopter and as it lifted off it exploded and every
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:28.600]  man was killed there were dead bodies everywhere pieces of bodies and that's
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:33.440]  exactly how they operate that's exactly what they would do send the seals out on
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:37.440]  a drill blow it up and then say they got bin Laden I mean that of course they're
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:40.360]  gonna kill the witnesses I mean that's the only way that they operate it that's
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:47.560]  standard well you know it's hard to know what's true and what's not true it's
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:51.920]  hard to know why the Pakistan would put out a false story like that we've got
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:56.240]  no way of knowing but what we do know is that nobody in the American media ask
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:02.560]  about it or looked into it or said could anything like this have happened is
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:06.520]  this the reason there's no body is this the reason there are no seals getting
[01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:13.840]  medals I mean what so who knows but there's so many things that we just
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:19.200]  overlook so much potential evidence different explanations and they never
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:22.440]  even get into the public's conscious now we're told just believe whatever
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:26.480]  government tells you even though they have a history of congenital lying Paul

[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:24.640]  Hussein has enlisted former top US officials including heads of the CIA
[02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:28.920]  FBI and Joint Chiefs of Staff and politicians from both parties to try to
[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:34.080]  get it removed from the State Department's terror list and it gets into the
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:40.400]  Mujahideen so when we come back from break and we'll go a little bit into
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:46.280]  overdrive next hour dr. Steve Pacinac will be joining us coming up here in
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:51.400]  about five minutes in other news you heard dr. Paul Craig Roberts earlier I
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:56.280]  don't like Dominique Stauskahn he's the head of the Socialist Party he's a big
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:03.920]  Bilderberg group globalist but he had been splitting with other counterparts in
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:11.320]  the IMF with Nicholas Sarkozy he was favored to beat Sarkozy and it is
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:15.520]  being reported by the mail and a bunch of other papers in fact they admit it
[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:22.800]  here that the topspin doctor the Carl Rove type for
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:29.000]  Nicholas Sarkozy admits that they knew about the fact that they were about to
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:33.360]  arrest him before it even happened another staffer for Sarkozy put a Twitter
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:38.720]  out before he was even arrested or as they were going to get him at the
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:43.160]  airport and claim that they had sources at the hotel so you see the
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:47.400]  intelligence operation all over this there's just so much action happening
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:52.080]  right now because all of this stuff is starting to come to a head and you have
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:58.760]  Esquire this known mouthpiece for the Democrats boldly boldly coming out and
[02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:03.680]  putting out a hoax article yesterday and not telling people it was a hoax to
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:07.520]  later in the afternoon saying they talked to Joseph Farah owner of World
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:12.200]  Net Daily and publisher of where's the birth certificate and that he was
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:16.600]  apologizing that the book was a lie and that he was going to recall the book and
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:21.760]  give everybody's money back when the book is a best-seller that's economic
[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:26.240]  espionage to to cause bookstores to have a run of people trying to get their
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:29.720]  money back so then they then pull the book from the store shelves I mean that
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:34.000]  is a super desperate dirty trick if the birth certificate gets discredited if
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:38.680]  that's all put to bed why do that in about an hour or so we have a video
[02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:44.240]  going up at info wars dot com and prison planet calm that breaks all this down and
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:51.960]  shows all the documentation for it so that is coming up as well we do have a
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:57.080]  doctor's Steve Pachinnick with us and we're gonna come back from break and
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:02.880]  talk to him about a host of issues Obama's speech today that Dr. Pachinnick
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:08.800]  talked about last week that was upcoming basically saying that Israel's got to
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:14.480]  give up most of the land it's taken since 67 all the same time telling us
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:19.000]  that these are great freedom fighting forces in the Middle East even though a
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:27.600]  lot of them are al Qaeda in Sudan in Libya in other areas and then a magic
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:32.760]  bin Laden tape comes out from the grave agreeing with this saying these are great
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:39.080]  freedom fighters I mean this is baloney and so it's all coming up with Dr. Steve
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:43.760]  Pachinnick on the other side we also have the Pakistani military coming out
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:47.200]  saying of more helicopters flying into their country they're gonna open up on
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:51.360]  them they already had a shootout and people being wounded on the Pakistani
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:57.160]  side Monday with a helicopter it's all coming up with Steve Pachinnick on the

[02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:14.840]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's

[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:27.440]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:31.240]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:34.840]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:18.040]  Dominic Strauss con thing all of it and and and how this ties into
[02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:25.160]  intelligence operations today. Dr. Pachennick good to have you back with us. It's always a
[02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:30.560]  pleasure to be on your show and I was so I rate as a citizen of the United States
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:37.320]  to read this in the Washington Times on May 18th which said that pick at GM's
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:40.600]  sponsors and celebrate soon to be released chai con that's Chinese
[02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:44.720]  Communist propaganda film and for your audience what this really means is that
[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:49.520]  the head of GM a gentleman by the name of Daniel Ackerson who was trained at
[02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:53.960]  the U.S. Naval Academy and worked his way up as a lieutenant on a destroyer and
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:59.240]  then became CEO thanks to our Treasury Department has decided to spend our
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:02.440]  money that's my money your money ladies and gentlemen the United States
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:09.040]  government where we own 33% of General Motors to finance and sponsor a
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:14.280]  propaganda film that's a communist Chinese communist propaganda film
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:19.480]  explaining how great the Chinese Communist Party is since its birth 90
[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:23.160]  years now let's differentiate between the Chinese people who have done a
[02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:29.000]  wonderful job of making their nation grow who have resisted this repressive
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:35.040]  Chinese company country have used their Twitter things like CNES INA and we've
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:40.680]  used our Twitter's and are I've used fax machines to help them in Chinaman Square
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:47.160]  and in turn this traitor American traitor Daniel Ackerson who's hired by us to
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:54.800]  fund GM which we sponsored has gone out of his way a sponsor this film called the
[02:11:54.800 --> 02:11:59.040]  birth of the Chinese Communist Party now for those of you may not know what the
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:04.680]  birth of the Chinese company it is built on repression death suppression and the
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:09.280]  killing of millions of millions Chinese no one has killed more not the Nazis
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:15.360]  not the Soviet Communist the Chinese government admits under Mao they say
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:21.200]  86 million our State Department says 64 million that the issue here as you can
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:25.560]  pull up the films they shot themselves of old women children being lined up
[02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:30.280]  their heads being blown off and this shows who runs our government by the
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:37.240]  way you have the well you're right Alex because this man this gentleman Daniel
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:41.200]  Ackerson was a member of which group the Carlisle group out of Washington once
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:46.160]  again that is been indicted for all kinds of like malfeasance experiences and
[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:50.440]  unusual activities financially but more importantly he was appointed by a
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:55.200]  Treasury Department so this is what I'm asking the Chinese citizens to go on
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:13:01.600]  CNES INA and Twitter against this issue and I want the Americans to Twitter to
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:08.120]  cease and desist this funding of the Chinese propaganda film now the
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:12.000]  communists remember Chinese Communist Party killed our American troops in
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:17.080]  North Korea they initiated the war in Korea they assisted in the Vietnam War
[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:22.040]  they assisted they floored millions which you said 60 to 80 million in the
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:27.320]  Cultural Revolution they then went on to Cambodia to assist the order genocide
[02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:31.880]  of the killing of the Cambodians themselves without any apologies and
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:36.400]  then they go forth and Tiananmen Square to suppress their own people and now
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:40.840]  they have the jasmine revolutions that means the young people who want to
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:46.600]  protest the truck drivers the cab drivers and I say to our Chinese friends and our
[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:51.280]  Chinese colleagues the citizens of China who are consuming our products go
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:55.960]  on CNES INA and Twitter your disappointments go into the streets and
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:14:00.200]  refuse to accept this and then I say to our American colleagues go Twitter and
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:05.560]  tell your congressmen and senators to stop this a breach is a breach is
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:12.320]  anti-American behavior and to stop funding Chinese propaganda well it shows
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:19.120]  it shows just how insane I'm sorry no it just shows how insane this White House
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:25.480]  is running GM and then using our tax money to finance something worshiping
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:29.600]  Mao Zedong we have all these restaurants opening called mouths the
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:34.880]  college kids are wearing mouth shirts these could not be bigger useful idiots
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:40.240]  Mao Zedong the Chinese government even admits did not bathe had sex with about
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:46.560]  six women a day was a degenerate piece of arrogant filth and this murdering
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:52.400]  blob of pus is being worshipped with our tax money it just shows how completely
[02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:56.600]  reprobate the federal government has become they are a pack of criminals
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:15:01.080]  worshipping another criminal that's correct I think this is really criminal
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:07.040]  activity considering that they're at this man Akerson again and particularly
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:12.240]  Cadillac division of GM and GM is assisting in abetting a entity the
[02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:16.560]  Chinese Communist Party up the Chinese people the Chinese Communist Party that
[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:21.440]  initiated a war and killed and assisted in killing thousands of our troops in
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:27.000]  war throughout and then through Vietnam war and then through the war in
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:32.320]  Indonesia and in Cambodia and this is not stopped and they're killing their own
[02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:37.000]  people so it is reprehensible but once again we're going back to the fact that
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:42.360]  we have civilian leaders who are in and not the hoods with your big politicians
[02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:46.440]  politicians didn't stop this this had to come out of the Washington Times not
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:51.680]  one Republicans stood up not one Democrats stood up not Michael Levine
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:57.440]  senator from Michigan to say cease and desist there is absolutely no political
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:03.160]  consciousness in our country or sense of patriotism where there is a sense of
[02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:07.800]  what's appropriate and not appropriate this is totally completely inappropriate
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:11.800]  and borders on trees and well they're doing it on purpose they're doing it on
[02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:16.120]  purpose to set the present just like TSA groping one-year-old you know
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:19.480]  children and grabbing their genitals in front of their parents they can get away
[02:16:19.480 --> 02:16:22.680]  with that the sky is the limit now I want to just go through these host of
[02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:28.000]  issues that you've raised now now we've had another week in the aftermath we've
[02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:32.880]  had a US helicopter go into Pakistan a shootout General Hamid ghoul said
[02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:37.080]  there's no doubt now that there's a move towards starting some new war with
[02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:41.720]  them Ron Paul has come out today and said the scuttlebutt is there are there is
[02:16:41.720 --> 02:16:46.680]  moves to in Congress and discussions about some type of occupation of
[02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:51.720]  Pakistan it's now come out in the big Pakistani papers that that reported
[02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:56.720]  CIA agent was trying to get uranium and other weapons to al-qaeda groups they
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:01.040]  control to frame Pakistan and general ghoul said look we don't want to be
[02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:05.120]  driven in the arms of the Russians of the Chinese but that's what this is
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:09.440]  doing and during the break when I first got you on you said there's no doubt now
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:15.640]  that that's what this raid is about internationally so dr. Pachinik I mean
[02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:19.480]  you worked over there you know you met bin Laden you worked in overthrowing the
[02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:23.720]  Russians driving them out what's your view on what's happening now that we
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:29.200]  have more hindsight let me say what I said a week ago and all I I I go back
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:33.360]  to and I go to the singular individual I go to the respect of the Secretary of
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:38.960]  Defense Gates who said it very clearly today we have embarrassed the Pakistan
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:44.600]  military it's enough and we should go on the issue that happened with Pakistan
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:48.040]  and the actual raid we're not talking about Osama bin Laden I told you he's
[02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:52.720]  been dead for ten years but the raid was a sit-ups operation to basically
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:59.160]  embarrass the ISI into basically getting out of the business of controlling the
[02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:03.960]  government of Pakistan whose president is Kalani. Kalani and the civil
[02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:08.200]  government in Pakistan cannot handle the inner service intelligence agency
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:13.840]  yesterday and the day before the head of ISI resigned and saying I can no longer
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:19.040]  function what I think this raid is about I was not told was and I think Gates has
[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:23.360]  said it very clearly that we have embarrassed the Pakistani ISI that
[02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:28.680]  basically they want a civilian government in Pakistan China has moved in
[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:33.600]  in effect to help the Pakistani but I do not believe again I will reiterate I do
[02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:38.080]  not believe we will occupy Pakistan we do not have the capability we don't have
[02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:42.840]  the desire and once again Gates reported and correctly so and we've known
[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:46.920]  this for a long time the national security arena we cannot fight two and a
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:51.480]  half wars anymore our our force structure in America was needed for two and a
[02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:56.080]  half wars that's this one war in the Atlantic one war on the Pacific and then
[02:18:56.080 --> 02:19:00.080]  a half a war somewhere wherever we need it we cannot do that anymore because of
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:04.080]  budget constraints and we go back to the key issue where Alex as you said
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:08.800]  repeatedly our biggest national security problem is not Osama bin Laden who's
[02:19:08.800 --> 02:19:14.800]  been dead or Al-Qaeda which is a Hakan a group it's really that our debt and our
[02:19:14.800 --> 02:19:19.120]  ceiling and the fact that we are financially in serious trouble there's
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:23.040]  in one general a one intelligence officer that will disagree with what I'm
[02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:27.560]  about to say that our debt and our financial crisis is really the national
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:32.840]  security problem the instrument Pakistan was that the ISI Pakistani did not want
[02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:38.800]  to control the Haqqani group that's H.A.Q.Q.A. and I who basically have created
[02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:45.400]  Al-Qaeda representatives in Afghanistan and have been using their surrogates and
[02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:50.600]  members of the Haqqani group to really incite the confrontation not only with
[02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:55.040]  American troops in Afghanistan which the Americans that cease and desist but with
[02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:59.540]  India it's the issue. Stay there stay there Dr. Pachanik I want to come back with a
[02:19:59.540 --> 02:20:03.520]  host of other issues straight ahead. Spring and a new growing season are here

[02:23:58.920 --> 02:24:12.200]  dot com dr. Steve Pachennick is our guest we're covering a waterfront today I
[02:24:12.200 --> 02:24:16.840]  wanted to in this short segment doctor and we'll get into a bunch of other
[02:24:16.840 --> 02:24:24.400]  issues look at Obama's speech but he just finished up about an hour ago for
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:28.960]  those that just joined us the president came out and well here's the headline
[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:34.240]  Palestinian state must be based on 1967 borders that's just more talk and they
[02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:38.840]  put it in the process status quo but he went on to say these revolutions are
[02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:43.440]  great these revolutions are wonderful and and named Libya where we know it's
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:50.160]  Western backed and the core group in there is Al Qaeda and we have former
[02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:55.440]  Al Qaeda leaders on record who were fighting us troops in Iraq regardless of
[02:24:55.440 --> 02:25:03.520]  what you think of these wars this is a schizophrenic policy that they're
[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:07.640]  engaged in you were fighting Al Qaeda in Pakistan but this is good Al Qaeda over
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:12.520]  here but meanwhile right on time or some of it lot and speaks from the grave
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:18.720]  another audio tape from the cash they found over a million documents where
[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:23.040]  they can just make up and project whatever they want dr. Parchinic and he
[02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:28.320]  agrees that these uprisings are great what is the whole point of this
[02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:34.920]  obviously latest new fake tape being put out well the new fake tape is once
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:38.720]  again the issues I said was some of them that have been dead for 10 years so
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:43.760]  basically what I think the point is as the raid was or whatever the raid was
[02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:48.320]  constituted was to basically say to those Al Qaeda members around the world of
[02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:52.760]  those who still fear the United States or might fear the United States that
[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:58.160]  there is information in here that we can pursue you we know where you are and at
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:02.920]  the same time it's intended to embarrass the Pakistani ISI and a service
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:07.800]  intelligence agency to say you know this is where the man lived he lived right
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:13.200]  near your military Institute and how come you didn't do anything about it it's a
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:18.280]  way of our pulling out of Pakistan not to create a war we don't need a war
[02:26:18.280 --> 02:26:22.920]  now we can't fight a war and and literally to try to transfer the power
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:28.480]  into the civilian area but what you said about Obama is that he is not in
[02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:32.760]  control of the foreign policy nor would you expect him to be in control that
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:37.240]  many of his members of the national security are civilians who had very
[02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:41.800]  little experience donlan as I said before is a lobbyist or Fannie Mae
[02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:46.040]  that's your national security advisor and the one he relies on is a guy named
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:50.920]  Dennis Ross who worked for me 20 30 years ago totally ineffectual individual
[02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:54.600]  who worked for both Republicans and Democrats has no history of any
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:58.640]  accomplishments other than self-aggrandizement and the ability to
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:04.040]  egregiously get himself into situations we're more talented people than himself
[02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:09.440]  like Danny Kerr and others who work for Bush and other Aaron Miller and and
[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:13.480]  others people I know are far more talented than he is so you have a very
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:18.320]  incompetent exceedingly incompetent individuals including Hillary Clinton
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:23.240]  who really has no idea what the national security issues are nor the strategy
[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:27.880]  the fact that the young kids are protesting is not an issue that was
[02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:34.080]  initiated by the United States to be sure was spontaneous Egypt was assisted by the
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:39.360]  US government but we had military to military contact so I do congratulate
[02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:44.280]  our military on that particularly our army where they did maintain control over
[02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:50.520]  the Egyptian riots and were able to maintain a stabilized situation but in
[02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:56.880]  fact what remains in Egypt and in Libya and elsewhere is really military force
[02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:00.600]  structures in other words whatever is related to our military the real issue
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:07.440]  for us in right now is Syria is toppling over Syria has never been a real ally of
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:13.000]  us Bashir Assad is a position he's an ophthalmologist I was interrogated by
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:18.480]  Syrian officials a couple years ago for five six hours no I saw I saw in major
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:23.800]  news reports that even previous to that don't you know was it the senior or the
[02:28:23.800 --> 02:28:30.360]  junior Assad the senior I knew the senior Assad whom we had worked I had
[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:35.080]  worked against repeatedly over 20 30 years he was a vicious exceedingly
[02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:40.240]  dangerous man who had created a lot of terrorist episodes and every time we
[02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:45.120]  came close to a peace treaty in the Middle East he could create incidences
[02:28:45.120 --> 02:28:50.000]  where people were just killed and he initiated wars against Israel and
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:56.240]  basically was a really evil man he killed 10 to 20,000 so-called Muslims in
[02:28:56.240 --> 02:29:01.760]  Hama and he had no qualms about it now his son is very ineffectual the people
[02:29:01.760 --> 02:29:10.400]  were protesting I encourage them they're in Aleppo, Hama, Homs, Latakia these are
[02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:14.540]  wonderful people 30% of Syria country where most people don't realize are
[02:29:14.540 --> 02:29:20.680]  Christians the rest of Sunni Shiite Druze the northern part of Syria is Kurds
[02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:24.920]  the Kurds are now separating from Iraq which I agree with the Kurds are
[02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:31.880]  separating from Syria which I agree with and so Bashir Assad has to go he must
[02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:36.920]  go and I do agree with the administration putting on an embargo on it but we
[02:29:36.920 --> 02:29:41.320]  should pull our ambassador out and our military will not be engaged in this
[02:29:41.320 --> 02:29:46.680]  this is an issue that Bashir Assad has to deal with stay there doc we got to go
[02:29:46.680 --> 02:29:49.160]  to break we're gonna come back and continue looking at geopolitical issues
[02:29:49.160 --> 02:29:52.680]  then you want to talk about Schwarzenegger we're on the march the

[02:36:28.880 --> 02:36:33.320]  their questions mirror what listeners have said especially Scalzen's and that
[02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:38.680]  is how can you say the government is evil and stage 9-11 and the evidence is
[02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:44.040]  legion or how can you sit there and then talk about them staging this new raid
[02:36:44.040 --> 02:36:50.800]  and say that that's when it's gone bad when you know who you work for Henry
[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:55.120]  Kissinger George Herbert Walker Bush I mean these are people you mentioned China
[02:36:55.120 --> 02:36:59.120]  earlier they were involved opening up China folks can argue well that's
[02:36:59.120 --> 02:37:03.360]  opening them up so then they can be changed into a free market system and I
[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:06.680]  understand all the arguments I don't want to put words in your mouth but but
[02:37:06.680 --> 02:37:11.160]  but you know the basically it's the statement of you come from that power
[02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:17.480]  structure and you know from this secret system and are you saying that things
[02:37:17.480 --> 02:37:23.280]  just went bad in 2001 or why are you going public or what is the point of
[02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:28.000]  this I mean I think I'm encapsulating a question yeah I understand people are
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:31.200]  wondering who I am what I am who I am it's not as important although you've
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:34.640]  said it and I'm not interested in self-proclaimed eyes that they want to
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:38.440]  read my books they're more than happy to I'm really not interested I'm going to
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:43.360]  do anything else three and I went on your show and I kept saying it is I lived
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:48.920]  in a world which was a gray zone and because of my loyalty to my country
[02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:54.520]  remember to the country and one of the one of the statements that I make a
[02:37:54.520 --> 02:37:58.720]  point of is my country right or wrong I will still defend my country in my
[02:37:58.720 --> 02:38:04.280]  Constitution I do not care who is in the office of the presidency I care about
[02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:09.680]  the office of the presidency and the Constitution and those men and women who
[02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:14.520]  fight for it so if I work for Henry Kissinger I was more than happy the next
[02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:20.160]  day to protest the war in Vietnam on the streets if I work for J senior Bush I
[02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:24.360]  was more than happy to protest what he said only in America this is what your
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:29.320]  public has to understand only in America can one work for a system and at the
[02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:34.200]  same time criticize the system I can't tell you how important that it is this is
[02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:39.440]  not all or nothing every country throughout history has had a high behind
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:44.160]  a bodyguard of lies that's the nature of national security but when those body
[02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:51.080]  guard of lies are inflicted upon the public that is a 9-11 or an LBJ pulling
[02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:56.920]  the the Gulf of Tunkin or stand down under the Kennedy Assad you know the
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:39:01.440]  Kennedy's going into a war all over the world then it's the point where guys
[02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:05.200]  like me who are American citizens it doesn't matter what my background is
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:09.560]  that's an issue for people to say well is he credible or not is he a member of
[02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:13.600]  the CFR you have a member of the CFR I'm also a member of the Association of
[02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:17.520]  former intelligence officers and national military and what I'm trying to
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:21.480]  say is in our government there are so many people who are both in the
[02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:25.360]  intelligence community the military community who feel like I do they are
[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:29.240]  American citizens you have the men and women who are fighting all over the
[02:39:29.240 --> 02:39:33.360]  world for reasons they may not understand and they don't agree with but
[02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:38.400]  still they serve our country the people who do not serve our country are the
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:41.600]  people who are in the process business which you've been talking about and
[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:46.640]  that's the bankers the lawyers the people who feel that process is more
[02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:51.680]  important than product and that and defending our country is more important
[02:39:51.680 --> 02:39:55.920]  that not defending our country and not going into our country to serve it is
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:39:59.640]  more important than their self-aggrandizement basically what you're
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:03.800]  saying is so you've been an insider you've done something I come out as an
[02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:08.880]  American citizen who says I follow the Constitution and I defend the
[02:40:08.880 --> 02:40:13.760]  Constitution with my life I serve my country right or wrong I still serve it
[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:18.800]  but I'm not afraid to die I've been sent into missions abroad many many times
[02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:23.360]  where I've offered and volunteered but at the same time I have never been afraid
[02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:28.120]  to tell the Jimmy Carter get the hell out of my crisis center I have told
[02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:32.480]  other presidents to get out of the way because I've got 500 hostages and they've
[02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:37.440]  done it and I'm not afraid to put myself on the line if I have to save lives
[02:40:37.440 --> 02:40:41.920]  and if that means I've got to save what I think is the American democracy of
[02:40:41.920 --> 02:40:45.320]  public I'm not that grandiose I'm not a Newt Gingrich or any one of these
[02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:50.680]  sociopaths I'm willing to say it's enough but at the same time I do not throw
[02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:54.800]  out the baby with the death order we have intelligence operatives and we have
[02:40:54.800 --> 02:40:59.040]  intelligence generals who are incredible they have four or five of
[02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:03.440]  master's degrees they have PhDs these are men who've been in combat who've
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:08.920]  served our country and are watching the civilians spoiling our country and those
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:13.680]  are the men and women I address I address our citizens who have two jobs and
[02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:18.840]  three jobs or alex Jones who comes out on his own and repeatedly is willing to
[02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:23.840]  be attacked and be called a conspirator or or a paranoid I mean all the
[02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:28.200]  adjectives that I receive I don't care about that what I care about is to say
[02:41:28.200 --> 02:41:31.480]  yeah I'm a member of all these things I don't necessarily attend them I'm also
[02:41:31.480 --> 02:41:34.840]  a member of the Red Carpet Lounge at United but doesn't mean I always go
[02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:39.360]  there but what I will not tolerate is when the American government the
[02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:44.520]  government per se will attack its own people will denigrate our capabilities
[02:41:44.520 --> 02:41:49.080]  in terms of our ability to be productive and to be able to make a living
[02:41:49.080 --> 02:41:53.040]  because we're entrepreneurs and because we don't want to be controlled by the
[02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:57.000]  government let me add a point here let me add a point here because I mean
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:00.600]  regardless you were right about the bin Laden already being dead after you
[02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:04.440]  tell my show about many things all these whether I'm right and wrong the
[02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:08.880]  real issue alex is what is the American public going to do I've been right
[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:13.160]  about 9-11 I was right it was a stand-down in a false flag I teach at the
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:17.560]  War College every year teaching that I was right about anybody you want to say
[02:42:17.560 --> 02:42:21.800]  it's not about being right when a physician tells you you've got cancer
[02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:26.240]  believe me I don't want to be right the question is what do you want to do and
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:29.920]  the answer is if you do nothing and we go over the same thing and I repeat
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:34.520]  listen we've got cancer in this country it is a disaster we have to clean it up
[02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:40.280]  this president is not qualified to be in charge but we don't need a revolution
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:43.760]  actively you've got to have a system that's changed because you're not gonna
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:48.080]  have that president again I don't care what you say and do and the next one in
[02:42:48.080 --> 02:42:52.400]  turn will be a Republican because the system is fixed as long as you have a
[02:42:52.400 --> 02:42:56.080]  electoral college being right is not what I'm interested it's what is the
[02:42:56.080 --> 02:43:00.040]  American public going to do and stand up for their rights if they decide they
[02:43:00.040 --> 02:43:02.840]  don't want to stand up for their rights they decide they don't want to put
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:07.960]  anybody in prison for 9-11 that's their decision not mine well I admire I
[02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:13.160]  admire your your courage coming out nine plus years ago saying 9-11 was an
[02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:18.240]  inside job and going over evidence and you know now saying you're willing to
[02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:23.360]  talk to a grand jury and and how do we ever expect people from the power
[02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:27.760]  structure to do the right thing and have the courage you have if when they
[02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:31.800]  come out we say well they're from the system and that's not what Roberts was
[02:43:31.800 --> 02:43:35.920]  saying is to some callers and you know to a certain extent a scousin and I
[02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:39.640]  understand his question Roberts was just saying well why doesn't he go ahead
[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:43.840]  basically and tell us who this general is because you know then he'll be a lot
[02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:47.920]  safer and and they won't come killing but then you've added that you've got
[02:43:47.920 --> 02:43:52.360]  mutually assured destruction you've got stuff on them waiting to be released if
[02:43:52.360 --> 02:43:56.240]  something happens to you I'm not worried about let's let's forget who
[02:43:56.240 --> 02:44:00.120]  Pachanic is as you said I'm not interested in who I am or what I am and
[02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:03.680]  this is not an issue of that this is an issue does the American public
[02:44:03.680 --> 02:44:08.640]  understand that this is going on if I can tell you Osama bin Laden has been
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:14.160]  dead for 10 years and no one but no one in the national security area refuted
[02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:19.800]  that statement nobody if I can tell you to stand down 9-11 not one person said
[02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:24.320]  in the national security area that that was wrong the issue isn't about Steve
[02:44:24.320 --> 02:44:29.040]  Pachanic and whether I'm afraid of my life the issue is what do you expect
[02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:33.960]  from your politicians who are egregiously spending our money wasting our
[02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:39.960]  money who really are not sitting there basically in a collusive relationship
[02:44:39.960 --> 02:44:44.560]  the word is collusion might be a friend that is they help each other nothing has
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:49.240]  changed in our democracy we do not have a democracy we have a republic and the
[02:44:49.240 --> 02:44:53.160]  issue does the American public want to stand for democracy and have a third
[02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:58.400]  party and demand that their money not go to the GM's you're sponsoring Chinese
[02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:02.480]  propaganda not going to presidents who have to fly all around the country the
[02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:06.760]  world do nothing not the sponsor presidents were spending a billion
[02:45:06.760 --> 02:45:11.160]  dollars but to really address the issues of the working class teachers who make
[02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:16.120]  very low salaries doctors who have no jobs and reimbursement and so on and so
[02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:20.880]  forth it is not my burden on my friend I come on the show and I'm willing to
[02:45:20.880 --> 02:45:25.040]  sacrifice my life I'm not that's not the issue the issue isn't even Alex
[02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:29.840]  Joan the issue is the American public at which point are they discussed it no I
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:36.720]  agree with you a nonsensical tea party where Sarah Palin stands up or some
[02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:41.120]  other bozo and in a song and dance routine where they co-op all kinds of
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:45.640]  issues that are not relevant to the American public and we have two parties
[02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:50.200]  that indicate it's an angle there's nothing there so the America has to
[02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:54.640]  decide are we going into a peaceful second revolution where we're addressing
[02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:58.080]  less federal government we're addressing the local issues of
[02:45:58.080 --> 02:46:03.400]  transportation jobs we have no jobs we have the American public want to talk
[02:46:03.400 --> 02:46:07.880]  about the unemployment which may be up to 18 million people when the American
[02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:12.360]  press could care less about it they want to sell papers the TV want to sell
[02:46:12.360 --> 02:46:16.720]  papers what we have to worry about is where is the jobs my friend where is
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:21.880]  our productivity stop whining about the bankers the bankers have to go to jail
[02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:26.200]  now one banker went to jail so instead of the American public continuously
[02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:30.600]  being a rut I'm saying you know why this and why that let's go back to the
[02:46:30.600 --> 02:46:35.080]  original American spirit where we then went went in with an entrepreneurial
[02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:39.640]  desire we created new jobs we created new industries we went forth
[02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:44.440]  irrespective of what our government now I hear you don't have the I'm sorry no
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:48.880]  no I mean I understand we were coming from and the fact is it overall does
[02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:53.960]  become a distraction from the bin Laden fable and from the the 9-11 false flag
[02:46:53.960 --> 02:46:57.320]  that's what they want you to do they want you to be distracted from the key
[02:46:57.320 --> 02:47:02.480]  issues I mean the issue of you know we have really important issues our economy
[02:47:02.480 --> 02:47:07.400]  as you said is going downhill we're turning around just slightly now China
[02:47:07.400 --> 02:47:11.280]  has been in an economic war with the United States there's people understand
[02:47:11.280 --> 02:47:15.520]  what that means that means that China has basically been in Latin America
[02:47:15.520 --> 02:47:19.320]  Africa the Middle East undercutting everything we've done every other
[02:47:19.320 --> 02:47:23.400]  country is done and what are we going to do and we have traders inside the
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:27.200]  government that have been bought off by these foreign lobbyists the Chinese in
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:30.880]  particular selling us out I want to speak to that later but now I want to
[02:47:30.880 --> 02:47:33.520]  shift gears into some of the other topics you brought up
[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:37.800]  Dominique Strauss-Kahn how does that integrate in with these private
[02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:42.000]  intelligence networks and Schwarzenegger you talked about the fact that for
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:46.560]  decades and now it's coming out that he has multiple loved children I know
[02:47:46.560 --> 02:47:50.560]  Hollywood folks that told me this years ago and said he's got one with his maid
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:55.360]  boom the years later they were right let's let's a Schwarzenegger Indian have
[02:47:55.360 --> 02:48:00.840]  themselves as not as important as the the again that the Psyops narrative of
[02:48:00.840 --> 02:48:06.680]  the politician who's married to the so-called victim Maria Shriver that
[02:48:06.680 --> 02:48:10.040]  collusive element that's use the word again collusion that means people
[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:14.000]  working together is true for the Clintons it was true for the Kennedys
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:18.120]  it's a story line that goes throughout our entire politics whether
[02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:23.000]  Republican or Democrat where the issue of family values comes in and a new
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:27.400]  narrative is created to the American public whether Republican on the right
[02:48:27.400 --> 02:48:31.200]  or the left buys into this garbage is absolutely nonsense
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:35.240]  Schwarzenegger you know I don't know the gentleman I worked in Hollywood I had
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:39.800]  heard that he's abusive whether he's physically abusive or emotionally abusive
[02:48:39.800 --> 02:48:44.040]  that's for our reporters to decide whether he was on the list at one of the
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:48.800]  biggest clients for Heidi Fleiss who ran a prostitution house and you see many of
[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:53.240]  her prostitutes in a famous film that Columbia releases the point is they use
[02:48:53.240 --> 02:48:58.600]  this for blackmail everybody knew why are they bringing it now continue I've
[02:48:58.600 --> 02:49:03.320]  no they brought it now because I think there was a tipping point I have no
[02:49:03.320 --> 02:49:07.520]  idea his is he could never get reelected he's going back into the movie
[02:49:07.520 --> 02:49:12.040]  business he's a very true businessman you have to admire his business but it's
[02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:17.800]  Maria Shriver notion that a wife of a politician did not know that here her
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:24.080]  husband has been fornicating for the past 20 to 30 years is absolute nonsense
[02:49:24.080 --> 02:49:28.000]  and she is coming out of the Kennedy family where you have a genetic history
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:32.120]  of this fornication so this is not a victim this is not a poor woman you're
[02:49:32.120 --> 02:49:36.400]  talking about a sadomasochistic relationship that serves her narrative
[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:40.840]  she wanted to be on the TV show she wants her own presence as the way
[02:49:40.840 --> 02:49:45.200]  Hillary Clinton did in an abusive relationship with Mr. Clinton who by the
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:49.360]  way if Hillary why do you think Hillary never became president in running with
[02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:55.360]  Obama the real issue wasn't Hillary was either better or worse than Obama nobody
[02:49:55.360 --> 02:49:59.400]  knew Obama was the key question at the time of her running was this question
[02:49:59.400 --> 02:50:04.440]  I was posed to me by a Democrat and the question was can Hillary win the
[02:50:04.440 --> 02:50:08.280]  election if everybody knows that Bill Clinton was still screwing around in
[02:50:08.280 --> 02:50:12.720]  California and my answer was categorically no so you have it on both
[02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:17.040]  sides you have a man a woman who's compromised by a man of Schwarzenegger
[02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:21.080]  and you have a woman who's talented in her own ways Hillary Clinton and
[02:50:21.080 --> 02:50:25.560]  compromised by Bill Clinton whose narcissism and ego is very equivalent to
[02:50:25.560 --> 02:50:30.480]  Schwarzenegger so what you have is a dynamic of narcissism entitlement and
[02:50:30.480 --> 02:50:35.200]  the ability to be abusive in both our relationships. Don't stay there.
[02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:41.440]  Let me get this straight the key is that we're paying for this unnecessarily we're paying a lot of
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:46.240]  money to cover up for the staffs for the nonsense for the spinning and the
[02:50:46.240 --> 02:50:49.960]  American public is sick and tired of this and all we want to do is get our money
[02:50:49.960 --> 02:50:54.720]  back get some candidate who has nothing to do with the issue of sex and...
[02:50:54.720 --> 02:50:58.640]  stay there doc we got a break but there's also the scythe that the media
[02:50:58.640 --> 02:51:02.120]  would keep it secret all these years.
[02:51:03.120 --> 02:51:08.240]  Alex Jones here with key information the US government is a Ponzi scheme that
[02:51:08.240 --> 02:51:11.560]  relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government
[02:51:11.560 --> 02:51:16.880]  bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a seller of US bonds
[02:51:16.880 --> 02:51:21.880]  in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by calling
[02:51:21.880 --> 02:51:25.480]  them currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying about
[02:51:25.480 --> 02:51:30.160]  70% of US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries our
[02:51:30.160 --> 02:51:33.960]  friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar
[02:51:33.960 --> 02:51:37.600]  will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their

[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:28.600]  the issue is if I was contacted by multiple famous bodybuilders whenever I
[02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:33.560]  put out a film part of a film exposing Schwarzenegger talking about hey he's
[02:54:33.560 --> 02:54:39.800]  got a son with the maid he's got another kid with you know this lady here's her
[02:54:39.800 --> 02:54:43.920]  name she's a blonde now you see it in the news I was told it by Hollywood people
[02:54:43.920 --> 02:54:49.080]  none of this is even a secret the women visiting Schwarzenegger every day but
[02:54:49.080 --> 02:54:54.280]  the the system allows that so then Schwarzenegger is compromised and now we
[02:54:54.280 --> 02:55:00.520]  have Dominic Strauss-Kahn who I'm not a fan of him a big globalist really that
[02:55:00.520 --> 02:55:03.960]  lead leader of the Socialist Party in France but come on first it's rape now
[02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:07.400]  it's attempted rape the cops are basically saying he's guilty up front
[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:11.960]  which is always a bad sign now we learned that the chief spin doctor for
[02:55:11.960 --> 02:55:17.800]  Sarkozy who Strauss-Kahn in the polls was set to beat for president next year
[02:55:17.800 --> 02:55:23.680]  tweets out you know kind of jumps the gun that oh he's been arrested for raping
[02:55:23.680 --> 02:55:27.160]  this woman and then they had another campaign official do it and then they
[02:55:27.160 --> 02:55:31.640]  said well we had an operative at the hotel oh so now they admit they're
[02:55:31.640 --> 02:55:35.680]  following him I don't know the whole thing's very suspicious but finishing up
[02:55:35.680 --> 02:55:40.520]  with the media playing along with this covering up for Schwarzenegger and what's
[02:55:40.520 --> 02:55:43.600]  going on with Strauss-Kahn now what's your take on all this dr. Pachennick
[02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:48.520]  well I'm not a great fan of Strauss-Kahn number one I grew up in France and I
[02:55:48.520 --> 02:55:52.000]  came to America because this is a country of opportunity France is not a
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:56.160]  country of opportunity and quite frankly France is not relevant to American
[02:55:56.160 --> 02:56:00.520]  national security interests it's just not relevant I think whether it's a
[02:56:00.520 --> 02:56:05.480]  setup or not I think it's pathetic the Strauss was always a pathetic figure
[02:56:05.480 --> 02:56:09.400]  he's always been compromised before but you know in the world of intelligence if
[02:56:09.400 --> 02:56:13.520]  you have an addiction and particularly it's a honey trap that is women are easy
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:18.240]  to bait you in and you know he deserves what he gets but it's not really
[02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:22.480]  relevant to what we are talking about here in the United States the difference
[02:56:22.480 --> 02:56:27.040]  with France is they're used to this they got upset by the way we handled him in
[02:56:27.040 --> 02:56:30.280]  the police station that we should have hidden him which is nonsense
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:35.120]  France is really not relevant it's a country that's so it's past 300 years
[02:56:35.120 --> 02:56:39.320]  ago and we should just leave it alone and visit it just because it's basically
[02:56:39.320 --> 02:56:43.720]  a museum it has no real viability to the United States let's get back to the
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:47.200]  United States which is really the most important country that we're talking
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:51.720]  about and why this Schwarzenegger issue is important not because of Schwarzenegger
[02:56:51.720 --> 02:56:55.840]  himself although the story was there we do have to give credit to the some of
[02:56:55.840 --> 02:57:00.080]  the reporters a woman reporter in the LA Times who tried to bring up this issue
[02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:06.440]  that he was groped and repeatedly was harassing women but unfortunately the
[02:57:06.440 --> 02:57:11.800]  major media comes in and people like it's a circus really want to hear the
[02:57:11.800 --> 02:57:16.160]  best that they want to hear about a man who talks about family values has the
[02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:21.120]  money and the ability to intimidate that's the key issue when it comes to
[02:57:21.120 --> 02:57:25.800]  power and you have people like the Clintons or the Schwarzeneggers or the
[02:57:25.800 --> 02:57:31.200]  Kennedys or anybody else it's about power and intimidation so the women can't
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:36.960]  come out the media gets intimidated and in turn they try to basically build an
[02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:41.560]  alliance or a collision with them very few reporters really try to break out
[02:57:41.560 --> 02:57:45.360]  and when they do they're co-opted if you can't say all the reporters were
[02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:48.760]  co-opted but most of the people co-opted and really we go back to the
[02:57:48.760 --> 02:57:53.800]  American public if you want bread and circus you've got it and basically
[02:57:53.800 --> 02:57:58.400]  Schwarzenegger is a theater brilliant genius at being able to create a
[02:57:58.400 --> 02:58:03.480]  psyops and he created the ultimate psyops that he had a family and he was a
[02:58:03.480 --> 02:58:09.080]  good family man and so forth and so on and so once again that psyops that's
[02:58:09.080 --> 02:58:13.360]  done domestically is costing us why is this important it's not important it
[02:58:13.360 --> 02:58:18.120]  shows a culture of lies and people being fed lies that's correct but at the same
[02:58:18.120 --> 02:58:22.920]  time let's talk about let's follow the money Alex this is costing the American
[02:58:22.920 --> 02:58:26.720]  public a lot of money millions and hundreds of millions of dollars to the
[02:58:26.720 --> 02:58:31.760]  board of staff in particular California that's the 26 billion dollar deficit
[02:58:31.760 --> 02:58:35.840]  Kerry Brown has to go back in there whether you like him or not stay there
[02:58:35.840 --> 02:58:39.640]  back in one minute doc back in one minute going into overdrive live stay
[02:58:39.640 --> 02:58:53.040]  with us thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today hundreds of
[02:58:53.040 --> 02:58:57.240]  nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[02:58:57.240 --> 02:59:02.240]  chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're
[02:59:02.240 --> 02:59:05.840]  pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I've turned in this
[02:59:05.840 --> 02:59:10.880]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[02:59:10.880 --> 02:59:16.240]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[02:59:16.240 --> 02:59:21.160]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[02:59:21.160 --> 02:59:25.520]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[02:59:25.520 --> 02:59:29.320]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[02:59:29.320 --> 02:59:33.240]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[02:59:33.240 --> 02:59:38.800]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[02:59:38.800 --> 02:59:44.480]  the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com

[03:00:30.680 --> 03:00:37.840]  800-259-9231 we've been covering a wide spectrum of ideas and information I
[03:00:37.840 --> 03:00:41.480]  was talking to a doc during the break and I said you know what else you want to
[03:00:41.480 --> 03:00:46.240]  get into and he said well you know the Europe's going under their currencies
[03:00:46.240 --> 03:00:51.520]  are imploding we've got to talk about basically what we face economically and
[03:00:51.520 --> 03:00:57.080]  and the fact that we need to point out who the big private bankers are who have
[03:00:57.080 --> 03:01:01.680]  got us into this situation and they need to be punished criminally they've
[03:01:01.680 --> 03:01:05.480]  committed crimes publicly even rolling stone in a big article that the Senate
[03:01:05.480 --> 03:01:09.320]  committee has found it was criminal so start the indictments where are the
[03:01:09.320 --> 03:01:12.640]  indictments because if they get away with this they can get away with even
[03:01:12.640 --> 03:01:15.440]  more I think what you're talking about earlier with this criminal class is
[03:01:15.440 --> 03:01:21.200]  we're having to finance this political inside crony capitalist class at the
[03:01:21.200 --> 03:01:25.400]  expense of all our liberties and our freedom and that America is on a razor's
[03:01:25.400 --> 03:01:32.640]  edge and that's why you as an insider are you know coming out well let me let
[03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:36.600]  me put it this way I'm not coming at I've always been no I know in terms of
[03:01:36.600 --> 03:01:40.600]  truth and I've been more than happy to take down institutions whether they're
[03:01:40.600 --> 03:01:45.600]  civilian foreign that's not an issue for me I and that's my the professional
[03:01:45.600 --> 03:01:50.000]  expertise and I've done it I'm in the organization and restructure them I save
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:54.360]  lives and I work on changing lives the real issue for us is to understand we
[03:01:54.360 --> 03:01:59.360]  do have criminals these are the heads of city group where they receive incredible
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:04.480]  amounts of money the names of blank fine who's the CEO of Goldman Sachs you have
[03:02:04.480 --> 03:02:08.800]  Ruben who was a consultant while the subprime came in and was our former
[03:02:08.800 --> 03:02:13.120]  secretary of treasury and received seventy five million dollars as he was
[03:02:13.120 --> 03:02:16.400]  the consultant the city group all the subprime came in and when he was asked
[03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:20.520]  what in fact happened he said I don't know I wasn't involved I mean what
[03:02:20.520 --> 03:02:25.920]  nonsense and we have a brilliant banking committee that did a brilliant job of
[03:02:25.920 --> 03:02:31.880]  writing up what happened I mean the FCC went in the investigated the the the
[03:02:31.880 --> 03:02:38.480]  financial committee read led by Peter Angelides wrote a brilliant book the
[03:02:38.480 --> 03:02:43.120]  financial crisis in the inquiry report and so did the Senate and I think it's
[03:02:43.120 --> 03:02:48.000]  time for the American public to demand indictments it's not as if we don't know
[03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:52.000]  where the crooks are there in the city group they're Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan,
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:56.440]  Chase Manhattan, do you have them or Wells Fargo, do you have them in the
[03:02:56.440 --> 03:03:00.520]  mortgage companies they're all listed here in the federal documents the answer
[03:03:00.520 --> 03:03:05.640]  now is for your public to stop whining stop complaining and stop seeing
[03:03:05.640 --> 03:03:09.120]  conspiracies and worrying about whether Steve Pichett is going to get killed or
[03:03:09.120 --> 03:03:14.000]  not because it's hard to spell his last name good God I mean I've had Noriega
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:18.040]  Chase mean he can't even spell it correctly every week so the issue really
[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:22.720]  to worry about is how do you get these people indicted so the future
[03:03:22.720 --> 03:03:27.840]  understands you cannot commit criminal acts financial acts against the American
[03:03:27.840 --> 03:03:32.040]  public no matter what your name is and particularly if your name is Goldman
[03:03:32.040 --> 03:03:37.640]  Sachs and this can continue so that's where the American public has to start
[03:03:37.640 --> 03:03:42.640]  it has to set to be backed by money whether it's GM and you have a man who's
[03:03:42.640 --> 03:03:47.080]  supporting the communist propaganda machinery or whether it's Goldman Sachs
[03:03:47.080 --> 03:03:51.960]  J.P. Morgan, Chase Manhattan, Chase and Wells Fargo and other banks that have
[03:03:51.960 --> 03:03:59.160]  outrightedly corrupted and admitted that they committed criminal acts yet
[03:03:59.160 --> 03:04:03.720]  nobody has put them in prison because your politicians the head of your Senate
[03:04:03.720 --> 03:04:08.720]  finance committee the subcommittees on finance are all funded by these guys so
[03:04:08.720 --> 03:04:14.360]  unless the American public demands to Twitter protest peacefully demands they
[03:04:14.360 --> 03:04:18.960]  be investigated and indicted this will not happen now let me tell you one thing
[03:04:18.960 --> 03:04:23.720]  it is clear in the financial crisis report that the real heroes of a lot of
[03:04:23.720 --> 03:04:28.240]  this institution are the attorney generals of the different states all of
[03:04:28.240 --> 03:04:34.760]  whom came in and said the federal rules and regulations are totally inappropriate
[03:04:34.760 --> 03:04:39.280]  to have national banks coming into state governments and created subprime
[03:04:39.280 --> 03:04:42.920]  minutes more get your stay there a lot of the attorney generals of the
[03:04:42.920 --> 03:04:46.960]  different states should be awarded for the fact that they stood up including the
[03:04:46.960 --> 03:04:51.520]  Manhattan attorney channel now you have Cyrus face juniors and attorney channel
[03:04:51.520 --> 03:04:55.320]  in Manhattan these people should be applauded for going after these
[03:04:55.320 --> 03:04:59.280]  criminals I stay there doc got a break very big a great points will be right
[03:04:59.280 --> 03:05:05.080]  back over the break David J. Smith for News Watch magazine did you know that
[03:05:05.080 --> 03:05:10.200]  the United Nations is a Trojan horse and that the secretary general of the
[03:05:10.200 --> 03:05:13.600]  United Nations has always been a socialist from the day that it was
[03:05:13.600 --> 03:05:18.440]  founded therefore it can only bring about a one-world communist government
[03:05:18.440 --> 03:05:24.200]  do you realize that they will be in charge of all weaponry if the United
[03:05:24.200 --> 03:05:29.240]  States and every other nation turns over to it any nation that rebels they
[03:05:29.240 --> 03:05:34.360]  will just send the nuclear weapon to bring it into subjection we'd like to

[03:08:08.440 --> 03:08:16.600]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN
[03:08:16.600 --> 03:08:25.000]  radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones I was just talking to
[03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:28.920]  Dr. Steve Pachinic about how we get this country back states rights nullification
[03:08:28.920 --> 03:08:34.400]  he was bringing up all these attorney generals trying to go after Obama with
[03:08:34.400 --> 03:08:41.440]  the carbon tax moves and trying to block that going after Goldman Sachs and
[03:08:41.440 --> 03:08:46.840]  others for their criminal activities I mean trillions have been stolen and the
[03:08:46.840 --> 03:08:50.600]  president cannot be allowed to stand that they're gonna get away with this
[03:08:50.600 --> 03:08:53.320]  Dr. Pachinic finish up with that point and we're gonna go to some phone calls
[03:08:53.320 --> 03:08:58.360]  I think I think Cornel Wild Cornel West who's a professor Princeton and
[03:08:58.360 --> 03:09:03.480]  African-american said it best that Obama is a black man representing the
[03:09:03.480 --> 03:09:10.080]  apetocracy and the money interest of Wall Street and this is inex unacceptable
[03:09:10.080 --> 03:09:15.080]  and he has to be held accountable the guys on Wall Street have to go to prison
[03:09:15.080 --> 03:09:20.440]  this is not a whether if or not and I I congratulate the attorney generals and
[03:09:20.440 --> 03:09:25.160]  the FBI and the various federal organizations that are cutting into
[03:09:25.160 --> 03:09:30.600]  this issue the SEC the new one the Office of Controller and other people who
[03:09:30.600 --> 03:09:33.840]  will go in and regulate them but they have to go to prison Department of
[03:09:33.840 --> 03:09:38.960]  Justice is now has to get involved as does the FBI so I have great faith in
[03:09:38.960 --> 03:09:42.840]  the ability for us to help people accountable let's go to the phones if
[03:09:42.840 --> 03:09:51.920]  you want any other points on ideas to expose this kleptocracy this banking
[03:09:51.920 --> 03:09:58.000]  kleptocracy yeah I mean basically you know let's talk about AIG what what but
[03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:02.320]  AIG was for selling insurance all over the world in many ways it was a cover
[03:10:02.320 --> 03:10:09.000]  for the CIA and operatives and really what does it do it re-insures those
[03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:14.120]  people who have to have insurance or create financial instruments that don't
[03:10:14.120 --> 03:10:19.280]  exist so you had this whole policy scheme that's still in existence where
[03:10:19.280 --> 03:10:23.920]  men like Geithner and Bernanke and others who really have never been in the
[03:10:23.920 --> 03:10:28.280]  world of real business they've all been quote policy thinkers which is
[03:10:28.280 --> 03:10:32.120]  something else we have to get rid of because these are the welfare clients
[03:10:32.120 --> 03:10:35.960]  of the United States the so-called think tanks in Washington there's nothing
[03:10:35.960 --> 03:10:41.160]  more than an elaborate welfare system for people at no jobs and basically we
[03:10:41.160 --> 03:10:45.200]  start to have to go back to devolution of federal power and getting back down
[03:10:45.200 --> 03:10:51.800]  to the state level and the county level where we can start initiating tax-free
[03:10:51.800 --> 03:10:56.880]  zones where we can start businesses and getting of the American worker back in
[03:10:56.880 --> 03:11:01.320]  there the mechanic the truck driver who doesn't have to pay $5 a gallon and
[03:11:01.320 --> 03:11:06.840]  diesel the librarian who can make a living the teachers who make more than
[03:11:06.840 --> 03:11:12.000]  23,000 versus the 68 billion million dollars that a banker makes for nothing
[03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:16.400]  else than just processing paper and the Wall Street Journal of newspapers say
[03:11:16.400 --> 03:11:21.080]  that he's indispensable which is absurd so the American public has to hold these
[03:11:21.080 --> 03:11:26.480]  people accountable and once we do we can go forward but in the meantime I think
[03:11:26.480 --> 03:11:30.280]  America will be turning around because China's in trouble right now their
[03:11:30.280 --> 03:11:34.840]  interest rates are going up the middle class is going up again using Cena and
[03:11:34.840 --> 03:11:40.680]  Twitter I think the American at the Chinese public will attack the Chinese
[03:11:40.680 --> 03:11:45.000]  government and I think the Chinese government has a very serious problem
[03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:51.200]  and I've said repeatedly of trying to suppress 1.3 billion Chinese and have
[03:11:51.200 --> 03:11:55.360]  a serious water problem right now they have a serious drought problem and
[03:11:55.360 --> 03:12:00.640]  their money unlike our own system is based on social stability where our
[03:12:00.640 --> 03:12:05.520]  system of capitalism based on profit the Chinese system is based on social
[03:12:05.520 --> 03:12:09.600]  stability which means if they don't keep outloaning money that is the Communist
[03:12:09.600 --> 03:12:14.080]  Party they will have unrest the likes of which they've never seen and let me give
[03:12:14.080 --> 03:12:19.280]  you an idea in a typical normal year and under the Communist Party in China right
[03:12:19.280 --> 03:12:25.080]  now a year ago they had 75,000 riots for corruption that's a normal year now
[03:12:25.080 --> 03:12:30.320]  you take a year like now where you have increased interest rates unemployment
[03:12:30.320 --> 03:12:34.960]  where students are exceedingly smart in China and very well educated more so
[03:12:34.960 --> 03:12:38.520]  than many cases our own students where they speak several languages and there
[03:12:38.520 --> 03:12:43.440]  are no jobs so the Chinese government has to be put on alert saying you're in
[03:12:43.440 --> 03:12:47.600]  trouble you're in major trouble if you want to expand the Pakistan you want to
[03:12:47.600 --> 03:12:51.600]  expand all over the world you've got bigger problems internally than anybody
[03:12:51.600 --> 03:12:56.680]  else has and now it's our turn to remain a superpower by getting our forces out
[03:12:56.680 --> 03:13:01.920]  of Iraq Afghanistan and the Middle East and start to work on redeploying our
[03:13:01.920 --> 03:13:07.720]  assets and our dollars transferred to civilian works major structures for
[03:13:07.720 --> 03:13:13.000]  employment not to get the banks out of trouble but employment real jobs real
[03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:17.680]  people and get the normal salaries that they deserve all right let's go to phone
[03:13:17.680 --> 03:13:22.800]  calls good points there Bill in Connecticut you're on the air welcome
[03:13:22.800 --> 03:13:30.720]  yes hi Alex hi dr. Pachanik I have two two points the first is I don't know how
[03:13:30.720 --> 03:13:35.000]  it will be able to resolve the financial mess when as you said we have this
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:46.680]  collusion between the politicians and the banks and even AIG so you have the
[03:13:46.680 --> 03:13:53.320]  Federal Reserve giving money to both AIG and Goldman Sachs and AIG was
[03:13:53.320 --> 03:14:00.520]  actually ensuring Goldman Sachs debt you know AIG was the holding company to
[03:14:00.520 --> 03:14:03.720]  then break the money up on one hand and then on the other hand they were giving
[03:14:03.720 --> 03:14:06.480]  money directly and then of course a Federal Reserve is just a holding
[03:14:06.480 --> 03:14:11.000]  company for Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and a handful of others and so it's just
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:15.880]  all one big mafia up there well I think what the gentleman's getting to and I
[03:14:15.880 --> 03:14:19.720]  agree with you is the only way I can see is that we have to hold them the report
[03:14:19.720 --> 03:14:23.600]  says is very clearly even their own federal report that we do have to put
[03:14:23.600 --> 03:14:27.240]  some people in prison not the Bernie Matos only and not the guys who are
[03:14:27.240 --> 03:14:30.640]  inside a trading that's that's the distraction you're talking about the
[03:14:30.640 --> 03:14:35.640]  president CEOs of AIG you're talking about the president's CEOs of Goldman
[03:14:35.640 --> 03:14:40.880]  Sachs of JP Morgan once they're in prison they can understand that this is not
[03:14:40.880 --> 03:14:44.080]  just a game where you can fool the public and then you're gonna have to put
[03:14:44.080 --> 03:14:49.160]  some of it your your congressmen and senators like Dodd, Barney Frank held
[03:14:49.160 --> 03:14:56.080]  accountable, Max Baucus all of these men who've been funded by AIG JP Morgan and
[03:14:56.080 --> 03:15:00.080]  they think this is also cute because they can be in bed with them that's not
[03:15:00.080 --> 03:15:03.280]  gonna occur unless the American public insists let's hold them accountable. No I
[03:15:03.280 --> 03:15:07.200]  agree we need to start beating the drums I mean even Rolling Stones said Senate
[03:15:07.200 --> 03:15:11.960]  committee proves it's criminal send them to prison it's time for hundreds of
[03:15:11.960 --> 03:15:15.760]  these prominent bankers and some of these members of Congress to be clapped
[03:15:15.760 --> 03:15:21.200]  in irons taken in given a jury trial and sent to prison and I'm not talking
[03:15:21.200 --> 03:15:25.200]  about country clubs and that will teach these criminals folks if you don't keep
[03:15:25.200 --> 03:15:31.000]  corruption under control you will fall apart like North Korea or Mexico and
[03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:33.760]  they're trying to win and set the precedent to then get away with this
[03:15:33.760 --> 03:15:38.880]  and use a police state against us it is us or them send them to prison. Bill
[03:15:38.880 --> 03:15:43.640]  thank you so much Rand. Let me say something nothing is more humility into
[03:15:43.640 --> 03:15:48.160]  Wall Street than to see Blank Fine or the heads of AIG and other people in
[03:15:48.160 --> 03:15:53.400]  Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley JP Morgan literally arrested during the daytime by
[03:15:53.400 --> 03:15:57.960]  the FBI they don't have to do it and trounced right out there in handcuffs
[03:15:57.960 --> 03:16:03.280]  sent to prison and let me tell you that is an effective deterrent to everybody
[03:16:03.280 --> 03:16:08.040]  including if you go into the Senate you go into Congress and you look at Barney
[03:16:08.040 --> 03:16:12.840]  Franks and Christopher Dodd and Max Baucus and you look at all the ones in
[03:16:12.840 --> 03:16:16.920]  the financial Senate committee both on the Republican Democrat put the handcuffs
[03:16:16.920 --> 03:16:21.760]  on them send them right through the daytime and show them on TV and believe
[03:16:21.760 --> 03:16:26.960]  me this will shut down this collusion it works very effectively it's a count of
[03:16:26.960 --> 03:16:32.440]  psyopsis but it works. Rand in New York are on the air with Dr. Pachinic. You know
[03:16:32.440 --> 03:16:36.320]  the American public has been dumbed down I mean we're dumber than a bag of
[03:16:36.320 --> 03:16:41.200]  concrete at this point it's got an efficient propaganda arm called mass
[03:16:41.200 --> 03:16:45.440]  media I mean it's like right I mean Billon's been dumped in the ocean what
[03:16:45.440 --> 03:16:49.520]  next he washes up on Gilligan's island you know I mean it's like what are we
[03:16:49.520 --> 03:16:52.720]  gonna be believing next how are we gonna fight this you know when they've got
[03:16:52.720 --> 03:16:56.000]  everybody so dumbed down and such you know I mean the propaganda that they've
[03:16:56.000 --> 03:16:59.360]  got. Well Rand let me say something though and I want you to continue but
[03:16:59.360 --> 03:17:05.160]  look I mean let's get real here there's a process of awakening people that want
[03:17:05.160 --> 03:17:09.240]  to be dumb are spectators they're not on the field we've got a hundred to one
[03:17:09.240 --> 03:17:13.240]  people on the field against these folks and so yes there are some dumb down
[03:17:13.240 --> 03:17:17.360]  people but there's a big awakening happening Congress has a 9% approval
[03:17:17.360 --> 03:17:23.080]  rating mainstream media has about a 12 and so everybody isn't buying it it's
[03:17:23.080 --> 03:17:26.960]  just that we don't know we're the majority because we still buy that final
[03:17:26.960 --> 03:17:31.800]  Psyop that we're alone because we're not arrogant and that actually plays
[03:17:31.800 --> 03:17:35.680]  against us because we are so humble the truth is let me tell you something I
[03:17:35.680 --> 03:17:41.040]  told you yesterday okay just as a bellwether I am known my face is known
[03:17:41.040 --> 03:17:47.120]  from YouTube the internet radio show newspapers and stuff okay five years
[03:17:47.120 --> 03:17:50.920]  ago I'd get off a plane in New York walk down a street for 30 minutes five
[03:17:50.920 --> 03:17:54.480]  people come over to me now I get off a plane in New York and walk I can't go

[03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:07.440]  whatever comes over to me now I'm not going to look Alex Jones is well known
[03:18:07.440 --> 03:18:14.200]  the point is is that is that you have no idea how powerful the liberty movement
[03:18:14.200 --> 03:18:20.400]  is don't underestimate the dr. Pachinick any comments I totally agree with Alex
[03:18:20.400 --> 03:18:24.200]  Jones I've always been a great supporter his I don't care what my title is
[03:18:24.200 --> 03:18:28.120]  conspiracies true as it doesn't really matter but I want you to understand and
[03:18:28.120 --> 03:18:31.640]  I want your all of your listeners to understand the American Revolution was
[03:18:31.640 --> 03:18:36.400]  not started by a majority of the people in the United States it was started by a
[03:18:36.400 --> 03:18:40.640]  few I don't have to go over the three percent three percent Jones have been
[03:18:40.640 --> 03:18:44.840]  remaining in there and the Thomas Jefferson's the Madison's the John Adams
[03:18:44.840 --> 03:18:49.440]  this is just a continuation of what our founding fathers said no matter what the
[03:18:49.440 --> 03:18:53.440]  mainstream media is now the American public is not dumbed down they are
[03:18:53.440 --> 03:18:57.120]  tired there's a lot of information they're overwhelmed and they will say it
[03:18:57.120 --> 03:19:01.560]  but there are no you know we are not dumb running the American public is not a
[03:19:01.560 --> 03:19:06.000]  dumb running politicians going to learn that but not expensive his or her
[03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:10.680]  career and possibly life but the point of fact is you have a lot of people in
[03:19:10.680 --> 03:19:14.600]  the government in both the civilian and military government who agree with what
[03:19:14.600 --> 03:19:19.240]  Alex Jones is saying and what he's doing and so do I I'm not coming out of the
[03:19:19.240 --> 03:19:24.200]  closet I've always been somebody who's told people exactly what they think I
[03:19:24.200 --> 03:19:27.960]  from the president the United States I don't agree with you we gotta go right we
[03:19:27.960 --> 03:19:32.280]  gotta go right Americans like that but just to be clear doc I wasn't saying oh
[03:19:32.280 --> 03:19:37.280]  look I'm big I want to be clear the average the average person fighting for
[03:19:37.280 --> 03:19:41.840]  and people believe in you as I do well but I mean more than that people don't
[03:19:41.840 --> 03:19:45.240]  know what Steve Pachinick looks like they don't know what you know Johnny

[03:24:27.720 --> 03:24:33.720]  of forgery we have gone over it it's undoubtedly a forgery and we break that
[03:24:33.720 --> 03:24:39.000]  down dr. Corsi is coming out he's always very careful they've done an
[03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:43.960]  analysis is gonna release it tomorrow it is fake and that's another question for
[03:24:43.960 --> 03:24:48.080]  dr. Pachinic why would they put out such a shoddy fake well dr. Corsi thinks
[03:24:48.080 --> 03:24:51.360]  that we're gonna more your calls here a minute we're keeping till 40 after so we
[03:24:51.360 --> 03:24:54.880]  can get to all of them that are currently on the board he thinks that they
[03:24:54.880 --> 03:24:58.520]  couldn't go to an agency because people might leak it or blow the whistle so
[03:24:58.520 --> 03:25:02.720]  they had to have somebody in the camp do it but you can see where it's low res
[03:25:02.720 --> 03:25:08.120]  and then it's high res where they've changed things the typewriter font is
[03:25:08.120 --> 03:25:13.320]  generated by a computer it's called caring that's confirmed just a crop
[03:25:13.320 --> 03:25:18.080]  across the board and also you can tell that it's a computer because you have
[03:25:18.080 --> 03:25:25.920]  typewriter typing where you blow it up and it's the exact same letter even down
[03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:31.560]  to the pixel now understand like a snowflake or a fingerprint every type
[03:25:31.560 --> 03:25:35.640]  writer strike is unique because the way it hits the ribbon the way it slams down
[03:25:35.640 --> 03:25:40.600]  around the edges creates the microscopic fingerprint of that unique
[03:25:40.600 --> 03:25:44.400]  strike depending on how hard you pushed and how it struck and how the paper was
[03:25:44.400 --> 03:25:48.840]  loaded the thing is a stinking fake dr. Pachinic we're gonna finish up with the
[03:25:48.840 --> 03:25:51.440]  awakening that's happening the positive news we talked about during the break
[03:25:51.440 --> 03:25:55.200]  and then finish up with Chris Michael Mark Bob and Brett we got to get to those
[03:25:55.200 --> 03:25:58.520]  callers and we're so honored to have you Steve Pachinic comms the great site
[03:25:58.520 --> 03:26:01.960]  folks can find out more about all your work there or so much of your work there
[03:26:01.960 --> 03:26:05.880]  but I know you probably haven't fully looked into this you may have you may
[03:26:05.880 --> 03:26:09.800]  not want to speak to it but we've looked at it Corsi's looked at it there's no
[03:26:09.800 --> 03:26:14.040]  doubt it's fake why would they put out such a ridiculous fake do they want to
[03:26:14.040 --> 03:26:18.080]  make this a diversionary issue or are they that shoddy or do you think it's
[03:26:18.080 --> 03:26:23.160]  real but I don't think the birth certificate I think it's a total
[03:26:23.160 --> 03:26:28.200]  distraction let's go back to a statement that I made about a week ago when I said
[03:26:28.200 --> 03:26:34.600]  my mother had been the major CIA operative in the 1960s a single white
[03:26:34.600 --> 03:26:40.840]  female going into a Muslim country like Indonesia who had a PhD in the very
[03:26:40.840 --> 03:26:47.200]  sophisticated subjects of anthropology sociology or teaching and taught English
[03:26:47.200 --> 03:26:52.360]  and was trained at the East West Center in Hawaii which by the way was under my
[03:26:52.360 --> 03:26:56.760]  jurisdiction as Deputy Assistant Secretary of East Asia and I know we use
[03:26:56.760 --> 03:27:02.600]  that legitimately as a front for the CIA and she probably was on a contract to the
[03:27:02.600 --> 03:27:08.320]  CIA was a CIA officer and the question is really not even relevant about birth
[03:27:08.320 --> 03:27:13.400]  certificate the question is why doesn't Obama accept the fact that his mother was
[03:27:13.400 --> 03:27:18.240]  a CIA operative his grandmother had worked in the banking system of Hawaii was
[03:27:18.240 --> 03:27:25.160]  also in a CIA operation and why is it that the CIA has a narrative that doesn't
[03:27:25.160 --> 03:27:29.200]  really make sense it's again that also that's why they're covering up is to
[03:27:29.200 --> 03:27:34.600]  cover up the the intelligence agency family and and there's even more than
[03:27:34.600 --> 03:27:38.200]  just those involved as Wayne match and others have documented why are they
[03:27:38.200 --> 03:27:41.160]  covering that up so there's there's definitely a cover-up but you're right
[03:27:41.160 --> 03:27:46.360]  if he's born out of the country in a CIA then you know still he's an American
[03:27:46.360 --> 03:27:50.920]  citizen yeah I mean whether he's American or not it's not the issue the
[03:27:50.920 --> 03:27:54.760]  issue is why is the intelligence narrative so
[03:27:54.760 --> 03:28:00.360]  distractive and why was it imposed again on the American public in a way that
[03:28:00.360 --> 03:28:05.720]  very few people really knew who Obama was other than Chicago and that he came
[03:28:05.720 --> 03:28:10.600]  out of nowhere which wasn't exactly true there's a CIA narrative that goes way
[03:28:10.600 --> 03:28:15.480]  back from 1960s it comes now and once again as I said the intelligence
[03:28:15.480 --> 03:28:20.200]  narrative is not good as it was not good in 9-11 and it was not good with
[03:28:20.200 --> 03:28:25.400]  Osama bin Laden's death this is nothing to do with conspiracy you could look at
[03:28:25.400 --> 03:28:30.560]  the NSA records she's on record for having been in the CIA you can look at
[03:28:30.560 --> 03:28:36.920]  the CIA documents I mean this is absurd basically you have a family who works
[03:28:36.920 --> 03:28:41.360]  for the CIA which is legitimate I mean the CIA should be very proud of this that
[03:28:41.360 --> 03:28:46.600]  in the 1960s they were able to recruit young single women to work in our the
[03:28:46.600 --> 03:28:50.560]  areas of expertise in dealing with Russians who were involved in the
[03:28:50.560 --> 03:28:56.440]  overthrow of the coup so hard to now why they have to impose that narrative on
[03:28:56.440 --> 03:29:02.040]  the American public again 30 years later and 40 years later but speaks the fact
[03:29:02.040 --> 03:29:07.480]  that the CIA may be out of control and the CIA is no longer relevant to either
[03:29:07.480 --> 03:29:12.200]  foreign affairs or but doc I understand it's an eye doc I understand that the deal
[03:29:12.200 --> 03:29:17.200]  with and hold the subcommittee on intelligence accountable mr. Berman who
[03:29:17.200 --> 03:29:20.720]  works in the House Intelligence Committee should answer these questions no but
[03:29:20.720 --> 03:29:24.960]  I'm asking you in public briefly we're going to break why would they put out a
[03:29:24.960 --> 03:29:31.120]  fake one because I don't know it because the narrative does not work it is a
[03:29:31.120 --> 03:29:35.840]  disaster they have messed up from the beginning again it's the Osama bin Laden
[03:29:35.840 --> 03:29:40.520]  but put on Obama the narratives are not working anymore it
[03:29:40.520 --> 03:29:46.160]  but the two sophisticated well they're right back we're gonna jam in calls one
[03:29:46.160 --> 03:29:49.240]  minute per caller because we got to get to this of our certificate videos stay

[03:32:03.400 --> 03:32:08.440]  typical doctor both a veterinary and a naturopathic physician doc asks why does
[03:32:08.440 --> 03:32:13.000]  the United States spend more money on health care by far and still rank 50th
[03:32:13.000 --> 03:32:16.680]  in health and longevity worldwide he believes that people should empower

[03:32:21.000 --> 03:32:25.640]  and attain optimal health and longevity through nutrition not by toxic

[03:35:49.200 --> 03:35:54.400]  and a synopsis of a solution that i've spent the last year in my life working

[03:36:09.920 --> 03:36:13.520]  and uh and it works very well it doesn't take a whole lot of money
[03:36:13.520 --> 03:36:17.840]  to get really good results but oddly enough you see all the criminals that
[03:36:17.840 --> 03:36:20.720]  you've been talking about today on on today's show
[03:36:20.720 --> 03:36:25.360]  these law enforcement agencies they're not offering rewards for their arrest
[03:36:25.360 --> 03:36:29.840]  as a very uh interesting observation and uh and because of this i've spent the
[03:36:29.840 --> 03:36:33.920]  last year in my life working on a website called arrest wanted
[03:36:33.920 --> 03:36:38.720]  dot com and this is a website where americans can directly

[03:36:56.000 --> 03:37:01.200]  hello alex dr buchenek um hi i was on i believe it was a drug report a couple
[03:37:01.200 --> 03:37:04.400]  of good days ago and they were talking about the uh
[03:37:04.400 --> 03:37:11.200]  and people that have uh turned up dead with regards to the uh bp golf oil spill
[03:37:11.200 --> 03:37:17.040]  and uh also that the most experienced deep water drilling manager at the time
[03:37:17.040 --> 03:37:20.480]  was removed from the platform just before they came to the most critical
[03:37:20.480 --> 03:37:25.600]  stage and they brought in a uh a rookie to take charge of the platform
[03:37:25.600 --> 03:37:29.760]  and then all of a sudden uh you know we had this bill and obama
[03:37:29.760 --> 03:37:33.040]  shuts down all drilling out in the gulf and shortly
[03:37:33.040 --> 03:37:37.600]  thereafter he announces how he wants to be the best customer
[03:37:37.600 --> 03:37:41.760]  for brazil and then it comes out to actually believe it not on back
[03:37:41.760 --> 03:37:46.960]  how uh george sorrell sones 25 million shares of this oil company down there
[03:37:46.960 --> 03:37:50.720]  in brazil and it just uh seems like the same
[03:37:50.720 --> 03:37:54.880]  modus operandi that we're seeing with 9 11 and uh
[03:37:54.880 --> 03:37:58.640]  how the government's working and and and big money working against us in our
[03:37:58.640 --> 03:38:02.480]  nation well i could tell you bp is not a very
[03:38:02.480 --> 03:38:06.480]  effective organization uh the shareholders are already uh
[03:38:06.480 --> 03:38:11.360]  questioning the management ceo he just messed up a major deal with russia so
[03:38:11.360 --> 03:38:16.000]  bp is unnoticed uh for the stockholders that they're not happy
[03:38:16.000 --> 03:38:20.000]  so whatever else you could say this is not a very effective company
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:23.360]  all right we've only got a minute or two left bobbin
[03:38:23.360 --> 03:38:26.800]  california uh you're on the air go ahead bob
[03:38:26.800 --> 03:38:30.240]  hey alex thank you for the opportunity to uh share with someone of
[03:38:30.240 --> 03:38:36.320]  dr protinix or reputation character a question is this for dr protinick
[03:38:36.320 --> 03:38:39.920]  um several years ago i had the opportunity to read a
[03:38:39.920 --> 03:38:46.080]  chinese document on unrestricted warfare my question is if he had a chance to
[03:38:46.080 --> 03:38:49.520]  read that document is it still valid today
[03:38:49.520 --> 03:38:53.360]  uh i don't i know that i think i know the document you're referring to
[03:38:53.360 --> 03:38:57.920]  basically the chinese warfare doctrine states that they will do a low-tech
[03:38:57.920 --> 03:39:02.720]  war and that they will not allow any incursion into this sphere of influence
[03:39:02.720 --> 03:39:05.520]  which they determined to be quite extensive
[03:39:05.520 --> 03:39:09.920]  in south china sea and they had real problems now with vietnam the philippines
[03:39:09.920 --> 03:39:13.920]  and the spratly islands and we're aware of that the sink back is doing a very
[03:39:13.920 --> 03:39:18.960]  good uh uh monitoring and and uh management of that whole
[03:39:18.960 --> 03:39:22.080]  area but the chinese are very aggressive contrary to what it
[03:39:22.080 --> 03:39:26.000]  they say they're exceedingly aggressive but yes i'm aware of the chinese war
[03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:30.000]  doctrine they're very aggressive
[03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:33.920]  all right thank you so much we're just out of time sorry to brett and others

[03:40:15.360 --> 03:40:18.160]  its own democracy so that's where we are right now

[03:40:58.640 --> 03:41:02.160]  i know that uh there's going to be a segment of people
[03:41:02.160 --> 03:41:09.600]  for which no matter what we put out uh this issue will not be put to rest
[03:41:09.600 --> 03:41:13.200]  but i'm speaking to the vast majority of the american people
[03:41:13.200 --> 03:41:17.520]  as well as to the press we do not have time
[03:41:17.520 --> 03:41:21.440]  for this kind of silliness we got better stuff to do
[03:41:21.440 --> 03:41:25.200]  i've got some very important breaking news for you dealing
[03:41:25.200 --> 03:41:29.040]  with the whole president obama birth certificate issue
[03:41:29.040 --> 03:41:32.480]  but before i get into the latest developments i want to make it clear
[03:41:32.480 --> 03:41:37.200]  in the last three years i did not embrace the birther issue
[03:41:37.200 --> 03:41:40.880]  i'm somebody that questions government look at nixon lying to us
[03:41:40.880 --> 03:41:44.800]  look at clinton lying about monica lawinsky and then
[03:41:44.800 --> 03:41:49.760]  cruise missling a african aspirin factory as a political diversion look at
[03:41:49.760 --> 03:41:55.200]  george w bush premeditatedly lying about wmd's and iraq and being
[03:41:55.200 --> 03:42:00.880]  caught so it's good to question but there's all these real issues
[03:42:00.880 --> 03:42:03.840]  out there that obama needs to be confronted on
[03:42:03.840 --> 03:42:07.440]  continuing torture wars giving health care waivers
[03:42:07.440 --> 03:42:12.080]  to his friends and i'll have to get the insurance so many things
[03:42:12.080 --> 03:42:16.080]  and i've wanted to focus on that so when this whole birth certificate issue
[03:42:16.080 --> 03:42:20.160]  first got raised three years ago i thought it was a red herring a
[03:42:20.160 --> 03:42:23.680]  distraction from issues but then a year or so later
[03:42:23.680 --> 03:42:29.920]  when they released this government receipt of a birth certificate and told
[03:42:29.920 --> 03:42:33.760]  everybody that this was the original and that nothing else existed and you were
[03:42:33.760 --> 03:42:37.920]  a crazy conspiracy theorist if you believe that a long form existed
[03:42:37.920 --> 03:42:40.480]  loony tones and this uh craziness has spread to capital
[03:42:40.480 --> 03:42:43.440]  hope for real now everybody's getting on the zoo bus when it comes to this
[03:42:43.440 --> 03:42:46.160]  question nutty questions about the president's birth certificate are
[03:42:46.160 --> 03:42:50.000]  being fueled by concerted talk show hosts like rush bow himself and of course
[03:42:50.000 --> 03:42:54.000]  some others like lou dobbs i'm showing you his birth certificate
[03:42:54.000 --> 03:42:58.240]  it's on the screen i'll take a close look i knew that that was a lie
[03:42:58.240 --> 03:43:02.400]  i knew that i had the original blueprint with my
[03:43:02.400 --> 03:43:07.120]  feet prints and my weight and the doctor's signature on it
[03:43:07.120 --> 03:43:10.960]  i knew that that was a lie but still i said ah
[03:43:10.960 --> 03:43:15.120]  who knows then the white house spent over two million dollars
[03:43:15.120 --> 03:43:19.200]  fighting lawsuits that were trying to get his long form birth certificate
[03:43:19.200 --> 03:43:23.040]  released then the governor elect abacrombie
[03:43:23.040 --> 03:43:27.280]  of hawaii said in january as he was going into office that he would get the
[03:43:27.280 --> 03:43:30.240]  original birth certificate and release it then he told
[03:43:30.240 --> 03:43:34.880]  some of the newspapers there in hawaii that he'd look for it and couldn't find it
[03:43:34.880 --> 03:43:37.840]  and i started saying to myself man this is really weird
[03:43:37.840 --> 03:43:42.720]  even if he couldn't find it he's a democrat why would he
[03:43:42.720 --> 03:43:46.080]  say that he couldn't find it it got stranger and stranger
[03:43:46.080 --> 03:43:49.840]  then about a month before this book was set to come out where's the birth
[03:43:49.840 --> 03:43:54.720]  certificate by dr jerome r corsie obama out of the blue comes out
[03:43:54.720 --> 03:43:58.880]  and gives a press conference and laughs about it and says here is my original
[03:43:58.880 --> 03:44:01.760]  birth certificate here's the long form i'm like wow
[03:44:01.760 --> 03:44:05.440]  they're being honest long form so i said good we can put this
[03:44:05.440 --> 03:44:09.040]  red herring to bed and now focus on the real issues
[03:44:09.040 --> 03:44:11.840]  like obama going along with the republicans
[03:44:11.840 --> 03:44:17.360]  uh in the continued banker bailout of tens of trillions of dollars
[03:44:17.360 --> 03:44:21.840]  but then our phone started ringing and we saw major
[03:44:21.840 --> 03:44:26.000]  photoshop blogs that weren't even political looking at this and pointing
[03:44:26.000 --> 03:44:29.760]  out that when you put it in illustrator you could break it into layers and and
[03:44:29.760 --> 03:44:33.440]  that's normal except that normally it only shows two
[03:44:33.440 --> 03:44:36.080]  layers there were a whole bunch of different layers
[03:44:36.080 --> 03:44:41.520]  and different areas were more pixelated and were lower res than other areas
[03:44:41.520 --> 03:44:45.760]  showing clearly that it had been altered and photoshopped
[03:44:45.760 --> 03:44:50.560]  then i began to notice that this was a typewriter but if you blew up
[03:44:50.560 --> 03:44:54.800]  letters printed by the typewriter stamped by the typewriter
[03:44:54.800 --> 03:45:00.640]  that they were exact copies of each other which is impossible a typewriter
[03:45:00.640 --> 03:45:06.240]  is a key striking the ink ribbon and depending on how hard you hit it
[03:45:06.240 --> 03:45:10.400]  or how it strikes the paper each one is different like a fingerprint
[03:45:10.400 --> 03:45:14.080]  or snowflake then i noticed that in the same type there were
[03:45:14.080 --> 03:45:17.760]  different letters from a different font you've got the
[03:45:17.760 --> 03:45:21.920]  code number out of sequence and out of date it was as if
[03:45:21.920 --> 03:45:26.240]  this had been forged on purpose to make this the issue
[03:45:26.240 --> 03:45:31.120]  and i pointed that out in our youtube video that's gotten over 600,000 views
[03:45:31.120 --> 03:45:36.000]  on the subject that this is a shoddy fraud it's well known that they have
[03:45:36.000 --> 03:45:40.560]  federal agencies like the cian others that are masters at making
[03:45:40.560 --> 03:45:44.240]  near perfect forgery so why was this so shoddy
[03:45:44.240 --> 03:45:49.120]  and why would obama counter donald trump going around talking about the
[03:45:49.120 --> 03:45:53.120]  birth certificate issue and dr corcy's book that was about to come out
[03:45:53.120 --> 03:45:57.440]  if it was a fraud if it was a joke if it didn't matter
[03:45:57.440 --> 03:46:02.320]  and as soon as we looked at this document it was clearly
[03:46:02.320 --> 03:46:06.640]  a fraud clearly a forgery and we asked ourselves why
[03:46:06.640 --> 03:46:09.680]  so understand ladies and gentlemen i'm nonpartisan
[03:46:09.680 --> 03:46:13.280]  i'm a constitutionalist i'm a libertarian i don't like the republicans or the
[03:46:13.280 --> 03:46:17.760]  democrats and i'm on record for that i simply look at things and break
[03:46:17.760 --> 03:46:22.400]  down the facts now the new information enters the story and here's
[03:46:22.400 --> 03:46:26.880]  where it gets crazy today
[03:46:26.880 --> 03:46:32.320]  esquire a a a known attack dog and political partisans of the democratic
[03:46:32.320 --> 03:46:36.400]  party came out and savaged world net daily
[03:46:36.400 --> 03:46:39.680]  published book by dr corcy where's the birth certificate
[03:46:39.680 --> 03:46:46.080]  and put out this huge hoax saying that it was being recalled 200,000 copies
[03:46:46.080 --> 03:46:51.040]  that uh joseph farrah the owner of world net daily had chewed out
[03:46:51.040 --> 03:46:57.200]  uh gerome corcy and that he was offering for people to get their money
[03:46:57.200 --> 03:47:02.640]  back and for publishers to send it in and this was not done by a satire
[03:47:02.640 --> 03:47:07.520]  writer this was not done by somebody who uh
[03:47:07.520 --> 03:47:12.160]  noted on the article that it was satire once the story launched and joseph
[03:47:12.160 --> 03:47:15.600]  farrah said he was going to sue or was thinking about suing then they added a
[03:47:15.600 --> 03:47:19.760]  little blurb at the bottom saying hey this is satire
[03:47:19.760 --> 03:47:23.920]  now this does a lot of things here it shows the white house is desperate
[03:47:23.920 --> 03:47:27.680]  this came out on the same day that the white house told abc news and others
[03:47:27.680 --> 03:47:31.040]  that they're going to run the not on obama's record
[03:47:31.040 --> 03:47:34.720]  of basically being a bush clone minus different rhetoric
[03:47:34.720 --> 03:47:39.120]  and that they were going to put out t-shirts about the birth certificate
[03:47:39.120 --> 03:47:42.240]  and make it a big joke because they don't want to focus on the issues
[03:47:42.240 --> 03:47:46.640]  so clearly in in a concerted effort they're still afraid of this book
[03:47:46.640 --> 03:47:50.160]  they come out and create a hoax saying it's been discredited
[03:47:50.160 --> 03:47:54.720]  the publisher has removed it he's taking it off bookstore shelves
[03:47:54.720 --> 03:47:57.760]  you can get your money back trying to create
[03:47:57.760 --> 03:48:01.680]  a grassroots buzz for people to try to get their money back
[03:48:01.680 --> 03:48:05.760]  i mean this is economic espionage this this is
[03:48:05.760 --> 03:48:10.320]  an extremely uh dirty trick and if the white house has already discredited all
[03:48:10.320 --> 03:48:14.160]  this and this is their new campaign slogan uh why
[03:48:14.160 --> 03:48:18.000]  then would they engage in this type of just unbelievably
[03:48:18.000 --> 03:48:21.120]  dirty trick and it's because they are scared well
[03:48:21.120 --> 03:48:25.440]  it now turns out that dr gerome coursey is going to be coming out in the next
[03:48:25.440 --> 03:48:28.880]  few days including on my radio show uh this friday
[03:48:28.880 --> 03:48:33.600]  and breaking down their forensic experts uh that have proven that basically
[03:48:33.600 --> 03:48:39.120]  this is a composite of multiple real uh
[03:48:39.120 --> 03:48:44.880]  hawaiian birth certificates from 1961 and that is what we had said
[03:48:44.880 --> 03:48:49.760]  a month ago when all this first broke again at first on air i was like well
[03:48:49.760 --> 03:48:52.480]  okay looks like it's real we'll have to check it but
[03:48:52.480 --> 03:48:56.000]  there you go let's move on to real issues and then we look at it and it's
[03:48:56.000 --> 03:48:59.680]  like oh my god this thing is fake on purpose so either it's they didn't
[03:48:59.680 --> 03:49:03.280]  want to use an agency and they use bob down the hall
[03:49:03.280 --> 03:49:07.520]  to do it because they were afraid of leaks to make a good fake a good forgery
[03:49:07.520 --> 03:49:12.400]  or they are simply engaging in a psi op trying to make
[03:49:12.400 --> 03:49:16.160]  the whole debate continue to be about the birth certificate because it's
[03:49:16.160 --> 03:49:20.640]  vulcanizing and divides the people along an issue
[03:49:20.640 --> 03:49:24.400]  that doesn't deal with the banker bailouts and the corruption and
[03:49:24.400 --> 03:49:28.000]  all the things that both major parties are involved in but either way you slice
[03:49:28.000 --> 03:49:31.600]  it this thing has been altered i mean in more than 50
[03:49:31.600 --> 03:49:35.200]  ways and that's conservative then you've got the white house
[03:49:35.200 --> 03:49:39.520]  releasing the latest final birth certificate
[03:49:39.520 --> 03:49:45.680]  and it's got this green hash background that is not on the copy that the
[03:49:45.680 --> 03:49:50.320]  associated press reportedly went to the stacks and got
[03:49:50.320 --> 03:49:53.520]  and of course he says he's going to produce evidence showing
[03:49:53.520 --> 03:49:56.800]  that they basically have gone in and inserted this
[03:49:56.800 --> 03:50:01.680]  into the book the same book in the archives that
[03:50:01.680 --> 03:50:05.200]  governor abacrame couldn't find and then you have the fact that this doesn't even
[03:50:05.200 --> 03:50:08.400]  have the official seal none of them do not the first ap
[03:50:08.400 --> 03:50:11.840]  when not the one the white house released and again i can go on for hours
[03:50:11.840 --> 03:50:16.400]  this is a giant mystery a giant who done it i don't know why they've put out this
[03:50:16.400 --> 03:50:19.920]  fake birth certificate he may have been born in hawaii
[03:50:19.920 --> 03:50:25.200]  i would rather debate obama on the issues just like i'm against most of the
[03:50:25.200 --> 03:50:28.720]  republican people that are running ladies and gentlemen it's up to all of us to
[03:50:28.720 --> 03:50:32.800]  figure out exactly what's happening but uh the norm for presidents of these
[03:50:32.800 --> 03:50:37.040]  corrupt administrations is to lie to us and we have obama come out and tell us
[03:50:37.040 --> 03:50:40.240]  that this is his birth certificate when they told us two and a half years ago
[03:50:40.240 --> 03:50:44.160]  that the last copy was the official birth certificate nothing else existed
[03:50:44.160 --> 03:50:48.000]  we've been lied to so much by government that we would be idiots to just
[03:50:48.000 --> 03:50:52.800]  believe what they told us because they told us
[03:50:52.800 --> 03:50:56.080]  it is common sense to question these people
[03:50:56.080 --> 03:51:00.000]  and i wish we could end this issue but it's only getting deeper
[03:51:00.000 --> 03:51:26.560]  and maybe that's what they want
