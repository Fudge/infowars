[00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:10.044]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.044 --> 00:00:11.625]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:13.165]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.165 --> 00:00:17.347]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.347 --> 00:00:21.429]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.867 --> 00:00:26.672]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, July 1st, 2013.
[00:00:26.672 --> 00:00:31.058]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger, sitting in for Alex today.
[00:00:31.058 --> 00:00:39.530]  He will be back tomorrow with some amazing guests, and speaking of amazing guests, we've got today coming up NSA insider Wayne Madsen.
[00:00:40.267 --> 00:00:42.308]  So you'll definitely want to stay tuned into that.
[00:00:42.308 --> 00:01:05.065]  He has been leaking documents that are now breaking news in the EU, showing that the United States government, well, the NSA, the CIA, and the FBI, I don't know if you can really call them the government, maybe the shadow government, has been bugging the embassies, the diplomats, basically all communications, going back to EU countries.
[00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:14.268]  So, that's big news, big breaking news, and I think the Guardian pulled their story on that after publishing it, so there's some controversy there already.
[00:01:14.268 --> 00:01:18.050]  We'll talk to Wayne Madsen later on in the show about that issue.
[00:01:19.113 --> 00:01:25.199]  Also coming up today in the, well, actually just at the bottom of this hour, we've got Greg Caton.
[00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:27.841]  He is a resident of Ecuador.
[00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:29.563]  He was kidnapped by the U.S.
[00:01:29.563 --> 00:01:34.948]  State Department at gunpoint in Ecuador, was illegally extradited.
[00:01:34.948 --> 00:01:38.051]  You can't even really use the word extradited because that implies a legal process.
[00:01:38.051 --> 00:01:44.057]  He was kidnapped, actually, out of Ecuador, flown back to the United States and thrown in prison for two years.
[00:01:45.154 --> 00:01:54.639]  And it turns out that the United States of America actually has a routine habit of kidnapping Americans that they want to kidnap in Ecuador.
[00:01:54.639 --> 00:02:11.027]  And the reason that's relevant right now is because, of course, Ed Snowden is seeking asylum in Ecuador and 14 other countries at the moment, according to recent press on DrudgeReport.com today, 15 countries on his list of possible asylum destinations.
[00:02:11.027 --> 00:02:13.529]  So what happens if Ed Snowden ends up in Ecuador?
[00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:14.989]  And then the U.S.
[00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.951]  government just decides to kidnap him like they did Greg Caton.
[00:02:17.951 --> 00:02:21.552]  Well, we're going to find out by talking to Mr. Caton today.
[00:02:21.552 --> 00:02:25.974]  Get more information about how that actually works and how lawless and insane it really is.
[00:02:25.974 --> 00:02:31.516]  Now on the world news front, by the way, we've just got a ton of news today on so many fronts.
[00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:34.117]  Health, politics, finance, you name it.
[00:02:34.117 --> 00:02:38.979]  And that's the reason I only have two guests today because it's just so much news to cover.
[00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:39.980]  We've got, of course,
[00:02:41.167 --> 00:02:48.776]  The big Egyptian protests, the biggest civil protests in the history of the world, according to some press reports, happening right now.
[00:02:48.776 --> 00:02:54.142]  They're trying to throw, I believe his name is Mohamed Morsi, out of office there.
[00:02:54.142 --> 00:03:00.209]  The recently elected leader of Egypt following the uprising against the former dictator.
[00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.729]  It's a big deal.
[00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:08.191]  We're talking about millions of people in the streets right now, and we're talking about the potential for armed conflict.
[00:03:08.191 --> 00:03:12.112]  So it could break out into an actual civil war, a shooting war in Egypt.
[00:03:12.112 --> 00:03:13.892]  That could happen in just the next few days.
[00:03:13.892 --> 00:03:15.352]  Now I know the U.S.
[00:03:15.352 --> 00:03:19.313]  press doesn't tend to cover those things very much, but it's something that you need to know about.
[00:03:19.313 --> 00:03:25.995]  Now in the United States today, one of the big issues that's happening is right here, just a few miles from where I sit here at the InfoWars studio,
[00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:40.027]  You've got Texas debating abortion limits and a big rally, well two big competing rallies are now forming at the Capitol building just a few miles from here.
[00:03:40.027 --> 00:03:45.113]  And you've got police officers in riot gear on horseback.
[00:03:46.616 --> 00:03:50.683]  And they're setting up massive barricades all around the state capitol.
[00:03:50.683 --> 00:03:59.217]  They brought in police in riot gear from Houston because apparently the Austin police force wasn't large enough so they had to ship them in from Houston.
[00:04:00.325 --> 00:04:09.454]  I guess, are they expecting some kind of a, are they expecting the pro-choice people to have a mad rush into the Capitol and have a coup or something?
[00:04:09.454 --> 00:04:14.780]  I mean, I'm not sure what's all the police all about, but things are heating up over there.
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.146]  The Democrats not happy that they can't kill babies after 20 weeks, 20 weeks of pregnancy.
[00:04:21.767 --> 00:04:29.916]  They want to have the right to make sure they can terminate that baby's life at 21 weeks, 24 weeks, 28 weeks, you name it.
[00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:35.202]  Hey, they want to kill the baby after it's born and call it post-birth abortion.
[00:04:35.202 --> 00:04:38.866]  So they are rallying to protect their, quote, right.
[00:04:39.787 --> 00:04:46.009]  To kill babies that are already, you know, humans, of course.
[00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:52.392]  I mean, viable human beings whose lives are protected under the Constitution.
[00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:54.073]  So that's what's going on right now.
[00:04:54.073 --> 00:04:58.034]  We'll be right back after this break with all that breaking news, all those guests, and much more.
[00:04:58.034 --> 00:04:59.595]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:59.595 --> 00:05:00.035]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:04.873]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[00:05:04.873 --> 00:05:08.215]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[00:05:08.215 --> 00:05:10.817]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[00:05:10.817 --> 00:05:14.239]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:20.463]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.
[00:05:20.743 --> 00:05:22.686]  Wonder if there'll really be a problem?
[00:05:22.686 --> 00:05:28.594]  eFoods Direct has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you'll be glad you ordered food.

[00:06:00.612 --> 00:06:04.033]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[00:06:04.033 --> 00:06:10.076]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[00:06:10.076 --> 00:06:13.958]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.538]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[00:06:15.538 --> 00:06:20.000]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[00:08:17.754 --> 00:08:21.324]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:21.324 --> 00:08:25.475]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.141]  All right, welcome to the show.
[00:08:28.141 --> 00:08:30.523]  This is Monday, July 1st, 2013.
[00:08:30.523 --> 00:08:32.164]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:32.164 --> 00:08:35.586]  Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in for Alex today.
[00:08:35.586 --> 00:08:36.907]  Alex will be back tomorrow.
[00:08:36.907 --> 00:08:38.728]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:38.728 --> 00:08:44.032]  We've got, for the next three hours, just astonishing news that you can't miss.
[00:08:44.032 --> 00:08:46.073]  And let me just give you an example of what we're talking about.
[00:08:46.073 --> 00:08:53.459]  And we also have some great guests coming on, including Wayne Madsen, NSA insider, who's been breaking news all over the world.
[00:08:53.459 --> 00:08:54.840]  So he'll be joining us in the second hour.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:13.200]  But check this out, the Department of Defense is creating a copy of all of us in an alternate reality, well a virtual reality, to find out how long you can go without food or water or how you will respond to televised propaganda, writes the Register.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.362]  It turns out that the DOD
[00:09:15.823 --> 00:09:21.507]  is developing a massive, what they call a sentient world simulation.
[00:09:21.507 --> 00:09:31.775]  They're creating a massive psyop simulator in a complex computer system to simulate the decisions of every sentient being on the planet.
[00:09:31.775 --> 00:09:43.423]  They're actually going to populate it with, you know, 7 billion little sentient programs or whatever the actual number is, to find out how you're going to react to their psychological operations.
[00:09:44.224 --> 00:09:49.469]  So then they're going to test in the simulation what would happen if they did a false flag attack, for example.
[00:09:49.469 --> 00:09:50.910]  How would you react?
[00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:56.615]  They're going to test what would happen if they dumped more fluoride into the water and dumbed everybody down a little more.
[00:09:56.615 --> 00:10:08.224]  They're going to test probably chemtrail attacks, biological weapons, rolling out more liberal propaganda, like making you think the family is bad.
[00:10:09.005 --> 00:10:24.445]  And that the only people that should have rights are undocumented immigrants or people who are not heterosexual, gays, or, you know, they're going to test every possible agenda they can think of in this simulator.
[00:10:24.445 --> 00:10:24.985]  So that's just...
[00:10:25.566 --> 00:10:29.370]  The start of the kind of news that we're going to get into today.
[00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:38.298]  This simulator, the Sentient World Simulator, replicates financial institutions, media outlets, and even street corner shops.
[00:10:38.298 --> 00:10:48.847]  It applies theories of economics and human psychology, and its developers believe they can predict how individuals and mobs will respond to various stressors.
[00:10:48.847 --> 00:10:51.309]  Well, isn't that just delightful?
[00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:57.373]  So now we're going to have a PSYOP simulator run by the Department of Defense.
[00:10:57.373 --> 00:11:03.296]  And need I remind you, by the way, that Google and NASA
[00:11:04.295 --> 00:11:06.215]  Remember, Google has ties to the NSA.
[00:11:06.215 --> 00:11:17.018]  NASA, part of the federal government, obviously, has just purchased a 512-qubit quantum computer that operates in multiple physical dimensional realities.
[00:11:17.018 --> 00:11:21.839]  I mean, this is science fiction becoming real.
[00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:26.760]  A 512-qubit quantum computer from a company called D-Wave has just been purchased.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.920]  Now, a quantum computer is
[00:11:30.662 --> 00:11:42.897]  Pardon the pun but the metaphor but literally quantum leaps above the processing capability of a normal CPU like you might have in your home computer or even the supercomputer.
[00:11:42.897 --> 00:11:49.624]  Quantum computers operate in multiple dimensions and they will allow these computing systems to achieve things like
[00:11:50.726 --> 00:11:53.447]  Easy speech recognition, visual recognition.
[00:11:53.447 --> 00:12:00.929]  They will allow robots to have tactical thinking, to have reasoning skills, to be able to outthink human beings.
[00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:03.209]  There's the article, it's in Scientific American.
[00:12:03.209 --> 00:12:07.170]  Google and NASA snap up quantum computer called D-Wave 2.
[00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:09.771]  I wrote about this on Natural News last week.
[00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:11.271]  It's a big deal.
[00:12:11.271 --> 00:12:13.112]  Because, and I'm going to talk about this later in the show,
[00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:18.951]  We are entering an era that is called the rise of the machines.
[00:12:18.951 --> 00:12:22.572]  Now Alex spoke about this last week and he was right on about it.
[00:12:22.572 --> 00:12:24.033]  His analysis is 100% correct.
[00:12:24.033 --> 00:12:29.994]  I'm going to add to that analysis today and tell you why the future doesn't need most of you.
[00:12:29.994 --> 00:12:42.218]  I know that's shocking to hear, but the rise of robots with quantum computing processing units is going to make most human labor obsolete.
[00:12:43.288 --> 00:12:51.313]  And that's going to mean that we're going to have five or six billion people on the planet that the globalists no longer need.
[00:12:51.313 --> 00:12:53.355]  So we'll get into that in more detail.
[00:12:53.355 --> 00:13:04.222]  You can only imagine what that means in terms of population control and mass soft kill, genocide, the Holocaust 2.0 that's going to be coming in the next few decades.
[00:13:04.222 --> 00:13:05.703]  But let's move on to other news in the meantime.
[00:13:05.703 --> 00:13:07.824]  We'll get back to that because that's more of an in-depth topic.
[00:13:07.824 --> 00:13:08.724]  Russian forces
[00:13:09.705 --> 00:13:11.686]  To provide security at U.S.
[00:13:11.686 --> 00:13:12.127]  events.
[00:13:12.127 --> 00:13:15.169]  This is a top story on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:13:15.169 --> 00:13:16.670]  Paul Joseph Watson wrote this.
[00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:17.790]  Check this out.
[00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:26.596]  FEMA signs a deal with the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry to quote, exchange experts.
[00:13:26.596 --> 00:13:36.242]  Yeah, we're going to exchange some experts so that Russian officials can provide security at mass events in the United States.
[00:13:36.242 --> 00:13:36.662]  Oh yeah.
[00:13:37.845 --> 00:13:39.846]  So the sellout of U.S.
[00:13:39.846 --> 00:13:42.128]  sovereignty continues.
[00:13:42.128 --> 00:13:43.608]  And of course, FEMA would love to do it.
[00:13:43.608 --> 00:13:51.753]  FEMA, of course, the agency that likes to go door-to-door confiscating people's guns every time there's a hurricane or a flood or a tornado.
[00:13:51.753 --> 00:13:54.815]  First thing they do is say, hey, let's take your guns.
[00:13:54.815 --> 00:13:55.555]  Take your guns away.
[00:13:55.555 --> 00:14:02.719]  And now we're going to have apparently Russian troops coming in to assist FEMA with that effort.
[00:14:02.719 --> 00:14:07.122]  There was a press release released by the Ministry of the Russian Federation for Civil Defense.
[00:14:08.451 --> 00:14:09.772]  And the U.S.
[00:14:09.772 --> 00:14:22.542]  officials, they met on June 25th at the 17th Joint U.S.-Russia Cooperation Committee on Emergency Situations, and they said they're going to quote exchange experts during joint rescue operations in major disasters.
[00:14:22.542 --> 00:14:24.503]  Oh, you mean like major disasters that the U.S.
[00:14:24.503 --> 00:14:26.465]  government causes?
[00:14:26.465 --> 00:14:28.647]  The ones that they make happen?
[00:14:31.678 --> 00:14:51.411]  I'm not saying that every hurricane or tornado or fire is caused by the government, but they can certainly set off their own disaster, such as an epidemic, a release of a bioweapon, a self-replicating weapon that could cause a national disaster, and then they call in the Russians.
[00:14:51.411 --> 00:14:56.214]  You know, it's funny, because Steve Quayle has been talking about this for many years.
[00:14:56.214 --> 00:14:58.856]  If you go to Steve Quayle's website, stevequayle.com,
[00:14:59.776 --> 00:15:02.583]  He's always got headlines that talk about, oh, the Russian troops coming in.
[00:15:02.583 --> 00:15:04.868]  That they're already positioned, he says.
[00:15:04.868 --> 00:15:07.674]  They're already positioned in key places all around the country.
[00:15:08.894 --> 00:15:17.979]  Not a lot of people are talking about that, but now here's further proof in the story that FEMA wants Russian troops to come in and take over in emergency situations.
[00:15:17.979 --> 00:15:19.780]  So, see, there you go.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.500]  There you go.
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.262]  It's all happening right before our very eyes.
[00:15:23.262 --> 00:15:30.206]  Now another story up on InfoWars.com by Kit Daniels, one of the newer members of the writing team here.
[00:15:30.206 --> 00:15:33.928]  ATF is arming robbers in hatched plots
[00:15:34.648 --> 00:15:35.709]  Leaving many dead.
[00:15:35.709 --> 00:15:39.290]  Now this is a huge breaking story and I think it was USA Today.
[00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:42.192]  Yeah, USA Today did a big in-depth investigation.
[00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:42.812]  Oh my God!
[00:15:42.812 --> 00:15:46.514]  USA Today was involved in actual journalism!
[00:15:46.514 --> 00:15:47.755]  I'm impressed!
[00:15:47.755 --> 00:15:48.355]  I'm impressed!
[00:15:48.355 --> 00:15:48.795]  I love it!
[00:15:48.795 --> 00:15:50.236]  I think they did a good job with this one.
[00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:53.105]  So the story is like this.
[00:15:53.105 --> 00:16:07.339]  ATF agents are setting up these honeypot operations, sting operations, to ensnare would-be armed robbers to say, hey, let's go hit this drug distribution
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.701]  We're good to go.
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:47.973]  Because the ATF is going out there and recruiting people who bring guns to the sting and lead starts flying and people end up dead.
[00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:51.977]  And so, not everybody in the court system is happy about all of this.
[00:16:51.977 --> 00:16:54.559]  In fact, they're saying it's a clear case of entrapment.
[00:16:55.811 --> 00:17:14.982]  That in fact one or two federal judges here is on the record, you have to look at the story on Infowars.com, ATF arming robbers is the first headline, that some judges are saying that this is entrapment, this is not legitimate, the ATF is running around recruiting these people and practically making them do this.
[00:17:14.982 --> 00:17:17.224]  Well, we know the FBI does the same thing!
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:23.504]  The FBI plans most of the terror plots that they then foil in the United States.
[00:17:23.504 --> 00:17:25.785]  That was right out of the New York Times!
[00:17:25.785 --> 00:17:28.307]  The FBI plans the attack.
[00:17:28.307 --> 00:17:31.449]  Remember, they planned an attack to blow up a bridge in Cleveland.
[00:17:31.449 --> 00:17:36.972]  They planned an attack to fly, what was it, a drone into the Pentagon, I think, or the White House.
[00:17:38.093 --> 00:17:46.536]  The FBI comes up with these plots, and then they run around finding these low IQ, mentally impaired individuals who are usually substance addicted.
[00:17:46.536 --> 00:18:00.281]  They give them a few beers, they give them some weed, they give them whatever to get them on board to say, yeah, you drive the van, you fly the drone, you set the bombs, whatever, we'll give you more weed, we'll give you more beer, more alcohol, more cash.
[00:18:00.281 --> 00:18:04.923]  And then at the very last minute, the FBI, oh, catches these terrorists!
[00:18:06.023 --> 00:18:06.564]  Oh, really?
[00:18:06.564 --> 00:18:12.268]  Well, they weren't terrorists until the FBI put the plans in their hands.
[00:18:12.268 --> 00:18:14.369]  They were just bums on the street, okay?
[00:18:14.369 --> 00:18:24.656]  Harmless bums sitting on the street until the FBI came along and recruited them to become terrorists so that the FBI could then claim it's stopping terrorism.
[00:18:24.656 --> 00:18:27.898]  And what kind of terrorism is it stopping?
[00:18:27.898 --> 00:18:28.499]  The terrorists
[00:18:29.159 --> 00:18:30.940]  That it comes up with!
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:36.222]  So, the ATF is now joining the FBI in this little scheme here.
[00:18:36.222 --> 00:18:38.183]  Now, I watched some of that video, by the way.
[00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:39.263]  It is freaky!
[00:18:39.263 --> 00:18:51.368]  You got this African-American dude in there, sitting in that car, talking about how he's gonna cap everybody, and how he's done it a million times before, and how he's so cool, and how he does it high on drugs to make sure that he's clear-headed.
[00:18:51.368 --> 00:18:53.348]  This is what he says in the car!
[00:18:53.348 --> 00:18:54.829]  This is on the video!
[00:18:54.829 --> 00:18:56.450]  I'm just like, wow!
[00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:56.670]  Man!
[00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.931]  No wonder I carry a Glock all the time.
[00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:05.792]  I mean, people like that come in, I'm going to let loose on them.
[00:19:05.792 --> 00:19:09.093]  And no wonder I don't run a drug distribution house.
[00:19:09.093 --> 00:19:13.714]  That's not a good career move, if you want to stay alive, by the way.
[00:19:13.714 --> 00:19:15.855]  Let's move on to some other news.
[00:19:15.855 --> 00:19:16.895]  I'm sorry, I've got to move faster.
[00:19:16.895 --> 00:19:19.776]  We've got so much crazy news, but it's all so insane at every level.
[00:19:20.976 --> 00:19:25.738]  We've got single women's insurance premiums for health insurance are going to double in California.
[00:19:25.738 --> 00:19:27.499]  That's thanks to Obamacare.
[00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:28.039]  Yeah.
[00:19:28.039 --> 00:19:31.301]  Thank you, Obama, for your gift to single women.
[00:19:31.301 --> 00:19:45.728]  Make them pay twice what they used to pay into the monopoly-run health insurance exchanges that have now been mandated by the same Supreme Court that says same-sex couples can marry each other.
[00:19:45.728 --> 00:19:49.730]  We'll talk about that in another minute when we come back.
[00:19:50.391 --> 00:19:52.499]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:52.499 --> 00:19:53.704]  The world is insane.
[00:19:53.704 --> 00:19:54.367]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:54.367 --> 00:19:54.889]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.822 --> 00:20:06.026]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:21:09.662 --> 00:21:10.462]  This capitalism?
[00:21:10.462 --> 00:21:16.626]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:16.626 --> 00:21:20.328]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:22:00.297 --> 00:22:01.719]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:01.719 --> 00:22:12.388]  Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[00:22:12.388 --> 00:22:19.595]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[00:22:19.595 --> 00:22:23.839]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at Infowars.com,

[00:22:30.862 --> 00:22:34.343]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[00:22:34.343 --> 00:22:40.486]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:22:40.486 --> 00:22:50.390]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:51.870]  The war is here.
[00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.191]  It's an info war.
[00:22:53.831 --> 00:23:00.357]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:23:00.357 --> 00:23:01.919]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[00:23:01.919 --> 00:23:08.005]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi!
[00:23:08.005 --> 00:23:12.229]  If you love to garden and compost but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or the smell,

[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:09.462]  Yeah.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.201]  All right, we're back.
[00:24:15.201 --> 00:24:16.802]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:16.802 --> 00:24:25.488]  Mike Adams, the health ranger, editor of NaturalNews.com, filling in for Alex today and enjoying the insanity of the news.
[00:24:25.488 --> 00:24:27.470]  Let's go to the next insane story.
[00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:33.995]  Clorox has unleashed a hate speech ad campaign smearing fathers.
[00:24:33.995 --> 00:24:38.718]  Yes, they're attacking fathers, calling them, well, essentially the same as clueless dogs.
[00:24:39.679 --> 00:24:45.523]  They're saying that fathers lack the judgment and fine motor skills to take care of children.
[00:24:45.523 --> 00:24:53.508]  Compares dads to dogs in an online promotional piece called Six Mistakes That New Dads Make.
[00:24:53.508 --> 00:25:09.219]  It accuses dads of being so stupid that they can't put their children's clothes on frontwards, the clothes are on backwards, and they take their babies out in the rain with short sleeves on and sit them down in front of reality TV shows like the Kardashians.
[00:25:10.139 --> 00:25:13.920]  And probably just incredible.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.641]  So here we go.
[00:25:16.641 --> 00:25:20.042]  Clorox has joined the bandwagon of attacking men.
[00:25:20.042 --> 00:25:22.423]  And I don't know about you out there, but I'm sick of it.
[00:25:22.423 --> 00:25:23.744]  I'm fed up with it.
[00:25:23.744 --> 00:25:26.664]  And I'm not going to be I'm not going to put up with it anymore.
[00:25:26.664 --> 00:25:36.848]  I'm going to talk about this, because if Clorox had said these very same things about blacks or women or gays,
[00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:55.187]  They would have been blasted, they would have marches on their headquarters, they would have been just reamed in the mainstream media, but because they chose to attack fathers, well suddenly it's all funny and it's all okay because dads are always depicted as morons.
[00:25:56.148 --> 00:26:03.175]  In sitcoms, and TV shows, and movies, and the popular press, and apparently by Clorox as well.
[00:26:03.175 --> 00:26:08.640]  So, I have announced over on Natural News a boycott of Burt's Bees.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:13.104]  You might say, wait a minute, what's Burt's Bees got to do with anything here?
[00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:15.086]  Well, Clorox owns Burt's Bees.
[00:26:15.746 --> 00:26:29.077]  So, I think that all dads out there should stop buying Clorox and stop buying Burt's Bees products to protest this attack, this hate speech attack against men.
[00:26:29.077 --> 00:26:31.739]  And here's some of the quotes that they say.
[00:26:31.739 --> 00:26:41.707]  Some fathers, men, dads have been inspired by raunchy comedies to bring babies to inappropriate places like casinos, pool halls, and poetry readings.
[00:26:41.707 --> 00:26:43.269]  This is actually from Clorox.
[00:26:45.299 --> 00:26:49.844]  This is hate speech against men.
[00:26:49.844 --> 00:26:55.010]  Now, what I'm wondering is, why is this okay to always attack men?
[00:26:55.010 --> 00:27:01.377]  And the answer is because the system is trying to destroy families, and especially trying to destroy men.
[00:27:01.377 --> 00:27:05.141]  And last week, when Alex covered with Ben Fuchs on this show,
[00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:16.192]  The feminization of men through BPA chemicals, plastics chemicals, hormone mimickers that are just throughout the food supply, throughout food packaging.
[00:27:18.188 --> 00:27:21.749]  He hit on something that's very true that the White House is denying.
[00:27:21.749 --> 00:27:25.170]  That these chemicals tend to feminize males.
[00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:35.794]  So you've got the male population in America is shifting towards a metro-sexual kind of stance, a feminization, where they're no longer willing to stand up for any of their rights.
[00:27:35.794 --> 00:27:41.356]  And that's part of the agenda, I think, is to get men to not stand up for their rights.
[00:27:41.356 --> 00:27:42.196]  Men are supposed to be
[00:27:42.876 --> 00:27:57.309]  The warrior archetype, the protectors of the family, part of the family unit working in cooperation with their wives to raise healthy children, but now the system wants to say, well, men are morons and only women can change diapers.
[00:27:58.109 --> 00:28:13.656]  And that's what Clorox has jumped onto, and of course they heard an earful from men who were tired of being smeared for being men, and they pulled that campaign off of the internet, but of course we linked to it, a cached version of it, so you can still see what it says.
[00:28:15.404 --> 00:28:18.766]  But this is a kind of sexism.
[00:28:18.766 --> 00:28:25.630]  And I'm wondering, when is the civil rights movement for men going to be formed?
[00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:27.091]  When is that going to take off?
[00:28:27.091 --> 00:28:34.316]  And when is the civil rights movement for maligned Caucasians going to take off?
[00:28:34.316 --> 00:28:41.761]  Because today it is apparently okay to use racial slurs, cracker, cracker this, cracker that.
[00:28:42.648 --> 00:28:51.100]  Against white men, and especially against fathers, as Clorox just did, it's okay to bash whites, it's okay to bash men, to blame them for everything!
[00:28:52.043 --> 00:28:57.707]  Civil rights is supposed to be about all men and women are created equal, regardless of your color.
[00:28:57.707 --> 00:29:01.090]  And I denounce racism, and I know that Alex does as well.
[00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:09.256]  Here at Infowars, we denounce racism, we denounce corporate smear campaigns against men and against fathers, and against women.
[00:29:09.256 --> 00:29:14.760]  We would jump to the same defense if they were attacking gays or women.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.541]  Or African Americans.
[00:29:16.541 --> 00:29:19.823]  Because we actually believe in civil rights.
[00:29:19.823 --> 00:29:27.707]  That is, that all men and women are created equal and that they all deserve equal protection and equal dignity in our culture.
[00:29:27.707 --> 00:29:32.389]  So enough of the attacks on white men and fathers, Clorox.
[00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:34.550]  Get it through your stinking heads.
[00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:36.011]  Fire your marketing department.
[00:29:36.451 --> 00:29:38.953]  And grow up and go back and read your history books.
[00:29:38.953 --> 00:29:40.554]  Read Martin Luther King.
[00:29:40.554 --> 00:29:45.277]  Judge people by the content of their character, not the color of their skin, okay?
[00:29:45.277 --> 00:29:46.698]  Get it through your heads.
[00:29:46.698 --> 00:29:47.499]  We're sick of it.
[00:29:47.499 --> 00:29:49.020]  We've had enough of it.
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:49.980]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.381]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.381 --> 00:29:53.923]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.923 --> 00:29:56.585]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:00.422 --> 00:31:05.143]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:31:05.143 --> 00:31:08.244]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:31:08.244 --> 00:31:13.805]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:15.746]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:31:15.746 --> 00:31:17.386]  We are what we eat.
[00:31:17.386 --> 00:31:22.047]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:31:22.047 --> 00:31:26.268]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:31:26.268 --> 00:31:28.529]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:31:28.829 --> 00:31:35.052]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:20.247]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:33:20.247 --> 00:33:21.207]  Thomas Jefferson
[00:33:24.108 --> 00:33:41.097]  I refuse to be censored and silenced by the bigots out there who say that anything that a white man says criticizing the position or the policy of a black president is automatically racist.
[00:33:41.097 --> 00:33:45.619]  I refuse to play that stupid mind game, alright?
[00:33:45.619 --> 00:33:53.403]  We're going to lay it out straight in every case and we're going to fight for the civil rights of everybody regardless of their skin color, regardless of their religion.
[00:33:55.134 --> 00:34:04.297]  I mean, this is a libertarian principle, that we think you should be free to live your life with minimum intervention, or at least government intervention possible.
[00:34:04.297 --> 00:34:17.101]  Even if I don't agree with your position, or your religion, or even your sexual orientation, I'm not going to go out there and push my beliefs on you, but at the same time, I don't want you to push your beliefs on me.
[00:34:17.961 --> 00:34:19.462]  It's a two-way street.
[00:34:19.462 --> 00:34:24.644]  You gotta respect and tolerate each other and have dignity for each other.
[00:34:24.644 --> 00:34:25.564]  That's the way it works.
[00:34:25.564 --> 00:34:31.987]  So, when I criticize an Obama policy, that's not racism, people.
[00:34:31.987 --> 00:34:38.950]  That's me criticizing a policy or a behavior or a speech or a decision of a person.
[00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:42.472]  It's not racism just because he happens to have more skin pigmentation.
[00:34:42.472 --> 00:34:43.332]  That's ridiculous.
[00:34:44.665 --> 00:34:45.729]  I mean, come on.
[00:34:45.729 --> 00:34:49.665]  You know, part of the problem, and by the way, we've got Greg Kayton coming up in just a second here.
[00:34:50.663 --> 00:34:51.564]  To talk about the U.S.
[00:34:51.564 --> 00:34:54.465]  government kidnapping Americans in Ecuador.
[00:34:54.465 --> 00:35:10.535]  But part of the problem is that we have gone past the threshold where most Americans can actually parse language, where you can actually communicate to them at a linguistic level of sufficient cognitive understanding, grasping the concepts that are trying to be discussed.
[00:35:10.535 --> 00:35:15.758]  And I think a great example of this was defense witness at the Zimmerman trial, Rachel Jeantel.
[00:35:17.797 --> 00:35:26.825]  I don't know how she was brought up or what chemicals she was exposed to, but she cannot parse language.
[00:35:26.825 --> 00:35:28.226]  She is illiterate.
[00:35:28.226 --> 00:35:31.369]  That is not a racist comment just because she's black.
[00:35:31.369 --> 00:35:36.434]  If a white woman was on the stand and did the same things, she would be illiterate.
[00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:38.996]  She is a victim of the system, people.
[00:35:38.996 --> 00:35:40.957]  I'm not criticizing her as a person.
[00:35:40.957 --> 00:35:42.479]  I'm saying she is a victim.
[00:35:42.959 --> 00:36:01.534]  Of the system, of the mass fluoride poisoning, of the heavy metals in the food, the pesticides in the food, all of the environmental chemicals that are put out there, the BPA and others, the chemtrails, are killing the brain function of people everywhere and we're starting to see that when a woman gets on the stand like that, a 19-year-old woman, and can't read!
[00:36:02.615 --> 00:36:05.636]  Something is wrong with our country and she is a victim, alright?
[00:36:05.636 --> 00:36:07.997]  And that's not racist to say that.
[00:36:07.997 --> 00:36:12.238]  I'm defending her against the system that's trying to poison her and kill her.
[00:36:12.238 --> 00:36:13.359]  It's sad.
[00:36:13.359 --> 00:36:27.603]  It saddens my heart to see a 19-year-old African-American woman, Haitian, you know, Haitian heritage growing up in Miami, who can't really speak in coherent sentences.
[00:36:27.603 --> 00:36:28.704]  Something is wrong with that.
[00:36:29.542 --> 00:36:37.367]  We need to protect all of us, all of our children, our young girls and boys, teenagers, black, white, Asian, you name it.
[00:36:37.367 --> 00:36:40.329]  We all are being victimized and poisoned by this system.
[00:36:40.329 --> 00:36:45.332]  We all need protection against the global elite that are trying to kill us.
[00:36:45.332 --> 00:36:49.114]  And I think she's just an example of just how bad it has gotten.
[00:36:49.114 --> 00:36:50.295]  So my heart goes out to her.
[00:36:50.295 --> 00:36:53.777]  I hope we can find a way to help her heal.
[00:36:53.777 --> 00:36:55.859]  Let's go to our guest, Greg Caton.
[00:36:56.932 --> 00:36:58.153]  Now let me give you a quick background.
[00:36:58.153 --> 00:36:59.575]  He's joining us by Skype.
[00:36:59.575 --> 00:37:00.776]  This is a big deal.
[00:37:00.776 --> 00:37:05.522]  You know how Edward Snowden says he may be seeking asylum in Ecuador?
[00:37:06.618 --> 00:37:11.222]  Well, that may not work out for him in the way that he thinks it will.
[00:37:11.222 --> 00:37:13.764]  And the reason is because the U.S.
[00:37:13.764 --> 00:37:30.698]  State Department has a track record of kidnapping American citizens in Ecuador who are breaking no laws whatsoever, but that America wants to bring back to America to persecute for its own political reasons.
[00:37:32.045 --> 00:37:39.952]  Now this has already happened to this gentleman, Greg Cate, and a man who I've known for many years because I wrote about him when this happened several years ago.
[00:37:39.952 --> 00:37:41.674]  He joins us by Skype now.
[00:37:41.674 --> 00:37:44.817]  Thank you, Greg, and welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:37:44.817 --> 00:37:45.718]  Thank you for having me, Mike.
[00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:57.081]  Well, it's great to have you on, Greg, and I would like you to lay out briefly the story of what happened to you, because back a couple years ago when it happened, no one believed us.
[00:37:57.081 --> 00:38:07.712]  Today, people believe more of the rogue shadow operations, so I want you to lay out what happened to you so that people can get this story, and now they will believe it.
[00:38:07.712 --> 00:38:08.713]  Well, I, um...
[00:38:12.912 --> 00:38:15.622]  Actually, a kidnapping attempt was made against me in November of 2008, so...
[00:38:18.853 --> 00:38:20.634]  I knew that we'd probably try it again.
[00:38:20.634 --> 00:38:37.137]  What happened is I had a business associate by the name of Dr. Neville Solomon, and these geniuses at the State Department, because I guess we're the same height gringos, we kind of stand out, kind of stood out in Guayaquil.
[00:38:37.137 --> 00:38:42.818]  Actually, because I had been living there, confused him for me and actually kidnapped him and his 15-year-old son, Michael.
[00:38:45.119 --> 00:38:52.729]  And only after interviewing them and for a period of three minutes were they able to figure out, oh my god, we've kidnapped the wrong guy!
[00:38:52.729 --> 00:38:57.555]  And when you say they, were these the State Department officials or had they bribed the locals?
[00:38:57.555 --> 00:39:01.441]  The protocol they normally use is, and this is done all over the world by the way,
[00:39:02.205 --> 00:39:06.328]  Most people don't know this has been codified in actually all the way to the U.S.
[00:39:06.328 --> 00:39:07.289]  Supreme Court.
[00:39:07.289 --> 00:39:17.417]  When I was kidnapped and brought back to the United States in Louisiana, I had a defense attorney by the name of Randall McCain out of Lafayette, Louisiana who defended me.
[00:39:17.417 --> 00:39:19.999]  And one of the first things he told me on the very first meeting, he says,
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.485]  You don't see, because I was saying, this was all illegal.
[00:39:23.485 --> 00:39:24.627]  Can't you do anything about this?
[00:39:24.627 --> 00:39:25.449]  It's part of my demons.
[00:39:25.449 --> 00:39:26.411]  No, I can't do anything about it.
[00:39:26.411 --> 00:39:26.831]  The U.S.
[00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:29.035]  Supreme Court has codified it.
[00:39:29.035 --> 00:39:32.882]  We will kidnap anybody, anywhere we want, for any reason.
[00:39:33.735 --> 00:39:37.356]  We don't need a justification.
[00:39:37.356 --> 00:39:42.038]  All this talk about extradition, this and extradition, that and political asylum, it's all smoke and mirrors.
[00:39:42.038 --> 00:39:44.399]  I gotta tell you right now, it's all smoke and mirrors.
[00:39:44.399 --> 00:39:47.580]  This is big breaking news right now.
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:51.281]  Sorry about the delay if I'm talking over you because you're joining us from Ecuador.
[00:39:51.281 --> 00:39:54.342]  A little bit of delay in the Skype, but this is big breaking news folks.
[00:39:54.762 --> 00:40:04.687]  Not only is the United States government running death squads that we know assassinate people like Breitbart and Michael Hastings and many others.
[00:40:04.687 --> 00:40:06.809]  Gary Webb, I think, was another case.
[00:40:06.809 --> 00:40:23.858]  They are also running globally kidnapping schemes against innocent Americans like you, Greg, because, again, you were engaged in selling a rainforest herbal topical salve, like a skin cream, that was perfectly legal to sell
[00:40:24.438 --> 00:40:26.480]  In Ecuador, you were breaking no laws whatsoever.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.341]  We still do.
[00:40:27.341 --> 00:40:28.522]  That's the whole thing about it.
[00:40:28.522 --> 00:40:29.142]  We still do.
[00:40:29.142 --> 00:40:36.728]  I mean, you know, we sell Amazonian, you know, medicinal herbs all over the world.
[00:40:36.728 --> 00:40:37.969]  It was never illegal.
[00:40:37.969 --> 00:40:43.254]  In fact, actually not even the overt reason that they claimed they were kidnapping.
[00:40:43.254 --> 00:40:45.175]  They said it was because of a probation violation.
[00:40:45.976 --> 00:41:00.712]  And the truth is is that I had someone while I was in prison the first time an employee who embezzled over $20,000 from us and after I got out I did an audit of our books and discovered it all and when she found out that I was going to go to the authorities she immediately went and started
[00:41:01.773 --> 00:41:02.293]  So you were set up?
[00:41:16.881 --> 00:41:17.762]  Oh, completely set up.
[00:41:17.762 --> 00:41:19.003]  And I knew it was being set up.
[00:41:19.003 --> 00:41:29.832]  So here I am in a room in downtown Guayaquil with the guy that's right under President Correa at the time it was the fellow who was the Minister of Government and his name was Gustavo Lorea.
[00:41:29.832 --> 00:41:32.435]  I'm sitting there with him and I'm sitting with the governor
[00:41:33.075 --> 00:41:35.638]  It's the 800-pound gorilla commercially speaking in the Ecuadorian economy.
[00:41:54.916 --> 00:42:01.200]  And they're assuring me, telling me, do you really believe, as if I'm an insane person, right?
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:19.790]  As if I must be insane for suggesting that over something as insignificant as a probation violation, which I didn't commit in the first place, by the way, which was supposedly that I was making H3O, the product that I was manufacturing, that I had in
[00:42:21.111 --> 00:42:24.354]  The United States.
[00:42:24.354 --> 00:42:27.696]  It's one step away from saying we need to kidnap this guy.
[00:42:27.696 --> 00:42:29.998]  We're the United States government.
[00:42:29.998 --> 00:42:32.840]  This guy has an overdue parking ticket.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.401]  We need to kidnap him and bring him back.
[00:42:34.401 --> 00:42:35.262]  He's overdue.
[00:42:35.262 --> 00:42:35.982]  We're going to get that $50.
[00:42:36.963 --> 00:42:38.324]  Right, but they did.
[00:42:38.324 --> 00:42:42.828]  And by the way, back your microphone off your mouth a little bit, getting a little bit static there, a little hot.
[00:42:42.828 --> 00:42:47.752]  But they did come kidnap you, which astonished the Ecuadorian officials.
[00:42:47.752 --> 00:42:52.836]  I know Correa himself was jaw-droppingly astonished that the U.S.
[00:42:52.836 --> 00:43:04.005]  would violate international law, would actually bring agents in there to conduct an armed operation against you in your own driveway to kidnap you, take you out of the country illegally, while at the same time people like Obama
[00:43:04.726 --> 00:43:08.980]  Accused Hong Kong of violating the rule of law for not turning over Edward Snowden.
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:10.345]  I mean, what hypocrisy?
[00:43:11.158 --> 00:43:12.558]  Well, it's beyond hypocrisy.
[00:43:12.558 --> 00:43:17.820]  On April 17th of 2012, there was a committee here.
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:20.721]  It's an immigration committee that decides difficult cases.
[00:43:20.721 --> 00:43:35.785]  And what the ruling of the Ecuadorian government was, is that what happened to me was completely without legal foundation, which is kind of a sweet, euphemistic way of saying, hey, United States government, you were rogues, you committed a rogue operation, and everything you did to this man is illegal.
[00:43:36.445 --> 00:43:37.706]  Now, what's the proof of that?
[00:43:37.706 --> 00:43:39.686]  I'm just kind of saying this on your... What is the proof of that?
[00:43:39.686 --> 00:43:47.009]  Well, the proof of that is that I'm here because in any country in the world, if you are deported for felony, any kind of felony, if you're deported, you're not coming back.
[00:43:47.009 --> 00:44:00.154]  You're not welcome back in a country that once you've been deported for legal reasons, so the... What they did is they... All the mention of my deportation and the records of the Ecuadorian government have been completely expunged.
[00:44:00.154 --> 00:44:00.595]  Why?
[00:44:00.595 --> 00:44:01.455]  Because it was illegal.
[00:44:02.015 --> 00:44:23.354]  In fact, you are an entrepreneur, a very successful one, I would say, who is in fact helping the Ecuadorian economy, bringing value to their rainforest, the renewable resources, the medicinal resources that people are being paid to harvest, and your company is packaging them and shipping them out.
[00:44:23.354 --> 00:44:26.998]  You're bringing jobs and also exporting health products
[00:44:27.478 --> 00:44:31.760]  To the other nations of the world that don't have the climate to have a rainforest.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:39.663]  I mean, you should be given a medal or something by Korea for a humanitarian award for what you're doing.
[00:44:39.663 --> 00:44:40.903]  He's got a serious lie.
[00:44:40.903 --> 00:44:42.624]  I don't think Korea's got a tough job.
[00:44:42.624 --> 00:44:43.404]  I mean, yeah, I know.
[00:44:43.404 --> 00:44:45.305]  I'm just saying, I'm just saying you're a good guy.
[00:44:45.305 --> 00:44:47.525]  You're not a criminal guy.
[00:44:47.525 --> 00:44:47.826]  Right.
[00:44:47.826 --> 00:44:54.388]  And the very fact that, uh, and then the other proof I, people sometimes raise their eyebrow when I say that,
[00:44:55.268 --> 00:45:01.071]  Everything that was put on, when I was put on the Interpol red list and my name was... Oh yeah, I want to talk about Interpol.
[00:45:01.071 --> 00:45:02.712]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:45:02.712 --> 00:45:04.332]  You know Osama, my first cousin?
[00:45:04.332 --> 00:45:05.433]  Osama bin Laden.
[00:45:05.433 --> 00:45:11.276]  Right, they had your face right next to Osama bin Laden and other like serial killers and war criminals.
[00:45:11.276 --> 00:45:15.278]  The State Department managed to get you put on Interpol.
[00:45:15.278 --> 00:45:24.282]  The proof that everything that the FDA and Interpol said was completely false is the fact that I'm here because I had my passport renewed in
[00:45:25.416 --> 00:45:28.024]  August of 2011, if I'd had any kind of pending...
[00:45:29.366 --> 00:45:38.873]  criminal charge that is even closely remotely similar to the things that the FDA and Interpol were saying that they wouldn't have even renewed my passport.
[00:45:38.873 --> 00:45:57.807]  Anyone who's ever gotten a passport knows you can't even be arrears on your child support payments now and get a United States passport, let alone have, you know, the criminal charges for hurting people with, you know, because you're... No, but they got their pound of flesh out of you because they put you in prison
[00:45:58.507 --> 00:46:01.108]  For, what was it, almost two years in Louisiana?
[00:46:01.108 --> 00:46:02.989]  Well, the total time was 21 months.
[00:46:02.989 --> 00:46:07.972]  You know, they give you 15% off, they give you a fig leaf for a good time.
[00:46:07.972 --> 00:46:21.258]  So they put you in prison, and you had to do the prison time, and then when you got out, they renewed your passport, and you went back to Ecuador, and Ecuador welcomed you back in, and there you are now running an admirable business yet again.
[00:46:21.258 --> 00:46:21.598]  Correct.
[00:46:21.598 --> 00:46:22.999]  It's incredible.
[00:46:22.999 --> 00:46:26.281]  I think what we see, what disturbs me, I don't know that this has really been
[00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:31.073]  Even conveyed to your audience the rapidity with which it's getting worse.
[00:46:31.073 --> 00:46:36.659]  Now, for instance, in my case, at least I can say I had the privilege of having a kangaroo court.
[00:46:36.659 --> 00:46:37.559]  It was all nonsense.
[00:46:37.559 --> 00:46:42.604]  The State Department is there basically dictating to the Ecuadorian judge just exactly how to violate the law.
[00:46:42.604 --> 00:46:52.393]  And by the way, I don't know what's ever happened to that judge, but I know that they'll never disclose to me what disciplinary measures they took against the
[00:46:53.033 --> 00:46:56.076]  People who were paid off on this side to do that.
[00:46:56.076 --> 00:47:00.301]  Greg, I want to make sure we get though to the other kidnappings that are taking place.
[00:47:00.301 --> 00:47:03.944]  Yeah, let's talk about James Martin Malone.
[00:47:03.944 --> 00:47:11.752]  This is a guy who, unlike myself, James Martin Malone was a guy, he's a few years younger than myself, I think he's something like 54 now.
[00:47:11.752 --> 00:47:12.913]  Anyways, in 1990, roughly 23 years ago,
[00:47:17.122 --> 00:47:29.845]  Marty was doing a job for somebody, he was transporting things along in his car, and he got caught up in some kind of drug bust for transporting drugs.
[00:47:29.845 --> 00:47:38.948]  And the prosecutor has since admitted, there's really no evidence that this guy ever knew, had conscious knowledge, that of all the things he had in his car, it included cocaine.
[00:47:40.177 --> 00:47:52.729]  Make a long story short, guy gets 22 years and finds a way to get out, or maybe he's on bail, I can't remember, but he gets to Ecuador and he lives here safely for a period of 22 years.
[00:47:52.729 --> 00:47:55.992]  And by the way, this was big news down in Ecuador.
[00:47:55.992 --> 00:47:57.333]  I knew this guy personally.
[00:47:57.333 --> 00:47:59.936]  His wife was the general manager of one of my companies.
[00:48:00.416 --> 00:48:00.896]  So what happened?
[00:48:00.896 --> 00:48:01.256]  What did they do?
[00:48:18.543 --> 00:48:30.350]  And she knew that he had legal issues back in the United States, so he gets ahold of local officials there in Santa Elena, Provincia de Santa Elena, and they pick him up, stick him on a plane and take him back.
[00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:33.471]  No law, no judge, no court, no nothing.
[00:48:33.471 --> 00:48:38.214]  All this talk I hear about, well, you know, Ecuador, they don't have an extradition treaty with the United States.
[00:48:38.214 --> 00:48:39.595]  It's all nonsense.
[00:48:39.595 --> 00:48:40.215]  It's all nonsense.
[00:48:40.535 --> 00:48:48.884]  What we're seeing globally is a pattern of complete lawlessness, where the United States government will do anything it wants, violate any law it wants.
[00:48:48.884 --> 00:48:56.351]  I mean, Obama's got secret kill lists, I guess they're not even that secret anymore, of Americans that he's going to have killed.
[00:48:56.351 --> 00:49:02.758]  Drone strikes on civilian weddings and parties all over the Middle East, killing women and children.
[00:49:04.159 --> 00:49:06.901]  And now we've got that it has come out that the U.S.
[00:49:06.901 --> 00:49:10.663]  government is spying on its EU allies.
[00:49:10.663 --> 00:49:17.167]  You know, the United States is getting a reputation for being a lawless, rogue nation.
[00:49:17.167 --> 00:49:19.028]  Kind of like the way we used to think of North Korea.
[00:49:19.028 --> 00:49:20.149]  That's what we're seeing here.
[00:49:20.149 --> 00:49:22.050]  I mean, and we see it in many different ways.
[00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:24.552]  And by the way, I'm not saying anything that's counter to
[00:49:25.498 --> 00:49:27.199]  The official message of the Ecuadorian government.
[00:49:27.199 --> 00:49:30.482]  You hear President Correa, I mean, he gives a weekly address here on Saturdays.
[00:49:30.482 --> 00:49:31.803]  You remember that, right, Mike?
[00:49:31.803 --> 00:49:33.805]  Yeah, yeah, I remember listening to some of that.
[00:49:33.805 --> 00:49:36.087]  And, you know, he's constantly railing.
[00:49:36.087 --> 00:49:42.172]  On the one hand, you know, it's not that Ecuador is in any kind of unfriendly posture to the United States.
[00:49:42.172 --> 00:49:46.355]  You know, there's a very... Ecuadorians go to Miami all the time.
[00:49:46.355 --> 00:49:48.958]  I mean, there's constant... there's trade back and forth.
[00:49:48.958 --> 00:49:50.399]  There's very good feelings, but it's like...
[00:49:51.926 --> 00:49:58.391]  The relationship between Ecuador and the United States is kind of like the wife who says to her husband, you will not disrespect me.
[00:49:58.391 --> 00:50:00.213]  You're not going to call me a bitch.
[00:50:00.213 --> 00:50:01.954]  If you fight with me, you're going to fight fair.
[00:50:01.954 --> 00:50:03.636]  You're going to respect my feelings.
[00:50:03.636 --> 00:50:06.398]  You're going to respect my opinions and you're not going to disrespect me.
[00:50:06.398 --> 00:50:07.519]  You know, it's that kind of a thing.
[00:50:07.519 --> 00:50:09.620]  And so you constantly have this thing.
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:13.123]  It's not like Ecuador is saying, you know, we hate the United States.
[00:50:15.265 --> 00:50:21.069]  But Cray has made it very, very, you know, he's a graduate, as you know, of the University of Illinois in Economics.
[00:50:21.069 --> 00:50:22.670]  He calls himself a half-gringo.
[00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:23.791]  He prefers himself kind of a...
[00:50:25.135 --> 00:50:30.601]  Let's bring it back to Snowden though, Greg.
[00:50:30.601 --> 00:50:44.957]  What would happen if Snowden, if Ed Snowden goes to Ecuador to seek asylum there, I want your assessment of what exactly would happen to him there, because it is very likely that the Ecuadorian government cannot protect him.
[00:50:45.658 --> 00:50:46.719]  From, let's say, a U.S.
[00:50:46.719 --> 00:50:49.360]  Navy SEAL team or something like that, if the U.S.
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:50.461]  really wants to get them.
[00:50:50.461 --> 00:50:58.986]  But let's talk about that when we come back with Greg Caton, the Amazon Rainforest herbal formulator who was kidnapped by U.S.
[00:50:58.986 --> 00:50:59.926]  State Department authorities.
[00:50:59.926 --> 00:51:00.527]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.147 --> 00:51:04.631]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[00:51:04.631 --> 00:51:07.694]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[00:51:07.694 --> 00:51:10.517]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[00:51:10.517 --> 00:51:13.960]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:20.207]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.
[00:51:20.487 --> 00:51:22.530]  Wonder if there'll really be a problem?

[00:53:18.286 --> 00:53:20.807]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[00:54:07.731 --> 00:54:09.392]  Alright, so this is big breaking news.
[00:54:09.392 --> 00:54:26.964]  This is the Alex Jones Show, and we have an exclusive interview with a man who was kidnapped from Ecuador by the United States government over the crime of selling medicinal herbal products that help people get healthier, if you can believe that.
[00:54:26.964 --> 00:54:33.368]  There's nothing I won't believe anymore in terms of what the government will do to oppress freedom.
[00:54:33.368 --> 00:54:36.810]  So, the question to you, Greg, is what would happen
[00:54:37.991 --> 00:54:47.059]  If Edward Snowden actually were granted asylum in Ecuador and relocated to Ecuador, do you think he would be safe there?
[00:54:47.059 --> 00:54:51.623]  Could Correa's administration protect him?
[00:54:51.623 --> 00:54:57.208]  Well, I can only give you my opinion based on what I've experienced here.
[00:54:57.208 --> 00:54:59.450]  Others that I've known have been kidnapped and so forth.
[00:55:01.283 --> 00:55:04.886]  He wouldn't have any semblance of a life that you and I would call free.
[00:55:04.886 --> 00:55:07.429]  I mean, he would have to be under some kind of military.
[00:55:07.429 --> 00:55:08.230]  He'd have to be guarded.
[00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:17.458]  He'd have to... Because, uh, based on the fact that this is such, apparently, such a, uh, a big piece of theater for the U.S.
[00:55:17.458 --> 00:55:22.323]  government, you had Biden down here actually telling Korea, you will not give this guy political asylum.
[00:55:22.323 --> 00:55:22.943]  And basically,
[00:55:23.784 --> 00:55:26.868]  What Correa did, this was in the news here, he was very respectful to Biden.
[00:55:26.868 --> 00:55:29.011]  He said, I respect your opinions.
[00:55:29.011 --> 00:55:35.720]  If he ever comes to Ecuador, if he does, you will be the first ones we call to get your input on the subject.
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:37.542]  But the final decision must be ours.
[00:55:37.542 --> 00:55:39.124]  That's again, it's again the thing of respect.
[00:55:39.264 --> 00:55:40.785]  Respect our sovereignty, okay?
[00:55:40.785 --> 00:55:43.126]  Respect that we are a sovereign nation.
[00:55:43.126 --> 00:55:54.150]  So, my opinion based on what I've seen here, one of two things would happen if he wasn't in some kind of almost a military prison with special forces protection.
[00:55:54.150 --> 00:56:00.393]  One, he'd either be kidnapped, they'd pay somebody who's corrupt within the police force to kidnap him, very much like they did in my case.
[00:56:01.721 --> 00:56:02.181]  Yeah, sure.
[00:56:02.181 --> 00:56:04.943]  He's welcome in the five minutes to end this segment and finish up the story with riveting radio.
[00:56:04.943 --> 00:56:06.304]  I just want to put some context in this.
[00:56:06.304 --> 00:56:07.025]  Can you guys hear me good?
[00:56:07.025 --> 00:56:07.485]  Yeah, you're good.
[00:56:07.485 --> 00:56:08.706]  Alright, I'm taking a good picture today.
[00:56:08.706 --> 00:56:09.807]  I appreciate you doing the show.
[00:56:09.807 --> 00:56:10.668]  I'm going back to work tonight.
[00:56:30.555 --> 00:56:34.580]  Look, there's an article on DrudgeReport.com on the right-hand side.
[00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:36.422]  Top story.
[00:56:36.422 --> 00:56:41.668]  Russian troops and Russian security forces advise at U.S.
[00:56:41.668 --> 00:56:43.450]  public events.
[00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:44.411]  What is this about?
[00:56:44.411 --> 00:56:48.876]  This is about global governance, State Department Memorandum 7277, international treaty.
[00:56:52.574 --> 00:57:04.329]  Where the diplomatic community, mercenaries, Interpol, police can go anywhere in the world and grab anybody they want and ignore extradition laws.
[00:57:04.329 --> 00:57:08.495]  And that's how Americans can be visiting Germany.
[00:57:09.369 --> 00:57:09.549]  Right.
[00:57:36.087 --> 00:57:38.109]  We have Mexican troops at Katrina.
[00:57:38.109 --> 00:57:38.730]  I thought U.S.
[00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:43.034]  troops were in Canada for the Olympics patrolling the streets.
[00:57:43.034 --> 00:57:50.541]  Well, the same death squads, Alex, that went out, they sent after Hastings or Breitbart or the Assassins.
[00:57:50.541 --> 00:57:52.803]  I mean, they are operating globally.
[00:57:52.803 --> 00:57:54.665]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:54.665 --> 00:57:56.106]  It came out in mainstream U.S.
[00:57:56.106 --> 00:57:58.028]  news, the back of the paper, five years ago.
[00:57:58.797 --> 00:58:07.803]  The former Latin American death squad hired by the CIA, more than 10,000 of them, were brought in to run death squads in Baghdad.
[00:58:07.803 --> 00:58:11.425]  This is a global mafia that does whatever it wants.
[00:58:11.425 --> 00:58:19.271]  I remember reading national news about this guy's case where the FDA just wanted to persecute somebody for selling a salve.
[00:58:19.271 --> 00:58:21.332]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:58:21.332 --> 00:58:23.093]  And so they went after him.
[00:58:23.093 --> 00:58:28.497]  And so I want to be able to finish the story, but I think it's important for people just to know in the context of Hastings,
[00:58:29.458 --> 00:58:30.659]  We're going to break, Alex.
[00:58:30.659 --> 00:58:33.062]  We'll be back in one minute.
[00:58:33.062 --> 00:58:35.705]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.905 --> 00:58:54.787]  Are we choosing our own destiny, or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:58:54.787 --> 00:59:00.289]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:59:00.289 --> 00:59:07.812]  Billions of dollars have been spent, privately and publicly, looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:59:08.012 --> 00:59:17.338]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:59:17.338 --> 00:59:24.523]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:59:24.523 --> 00:59:27.545]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:59:27.545 --> 00:59:34.330]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:35.830]  Oh, there's another one!
[00:59:35.830 --> 00:59:37.231]  Another plane just hit!
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:10.403]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.403 --> 01:00:12.003]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.003 --> 01:00:13.544]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.544 --> 01:00:17.727]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.727 --> 01:00:21.789]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.705 --> 01:00:24.506]  And we're back at the top of the second hour.
[01:00:24.506 --> 01:00:26.027]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:26.027 --> 01:00:32.812]  Mike Adams filling in for Alex today, who was just joining us in the last segment with some very important points.
[01:00:32.812 --> 01:00:43.940]  We are interviewing Greg Caton, and Alex mentioned how we are dealing with a global lawless mafia that will run kidnapping operations anywhere it wants in any country.
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:47.322]  That respects no law, no sovereignty whatsoever.
[01:00:47.322 --> 01:01:03.012]  Remember the work of John Perkins, Confessions of an Economic Hitman, where he described exactly what they did in Central and South America to assassinate leaders, to overthrow governments, to put governments in debt to US interests.
[01:01:03.992 --> 01:01:08.076]  And this kind of thing continues and Greg Caton joins us for the rest of this segment.
[01:01:08.076 --> 01:01:17.804]  He is one of the many victims of the U.S.-run international kidnapping operations and this is an exclusive interview here on InfoWars.com.
[01:01:17.804 --> 01:01:27.992]  So Greg, before you got interrupted there, you were finishing your assessment of what you think might happen to Edward Snowden if he is granted asylum in Ecuador.
[01:01:27.992 --> 01:01:30.154]  You want to finish that thought?
[01:01:30.154 --> 01:01:31.155]  Yeah, it's simply that
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:34.821]  He wouldn't be a free man.
[01:01:34.821 --> 01:01:48.006]  He's not going to be like, you know, if I want to leave here and I want to go down to, you know, Coffee Tree or one of the other gringo hangouts here and talk to my friends, because here in Cuenca you've got, you know, 5,000 Americans who are down here.
[01:01:48.006 --> 01:01:57.850]  By the way, it would surprise you, even you, and I know you've lived here, to know how many people are flooding down here and the percentage of them that are here because of just the frightening events
[01:01:58.615 --> 01:01:59.075]  The U.N.
[01:01:59.075 --> 01:02:00.276]  Acolytes have been reporting.
[01:02:00.276 --> 01:02:04.278]  Exactly!
[01:02:04.278 --> 01:02:20.765]  You know, I mean, I personally, just by way of example, I personally, this is a very close person, I personally know of a rancher in Montana that moved down here because he went hunting and he ran into a railroad spur and saw with his own eyes, what the hell is this?
[01:02:20.765 --> 01:02:27.308]  He found boxcars three levels high, shackles all around the perimeter, every other boxcar had a guillotine in it,
[01:02:27.928 --> 01:02:33.089]  And of course, you know, he's just got this huge, gigantic WTF going on the back of his mind.
[01:02:33.089 --> 01:02:35.290]  He got out.
[01:02:35.290 --> 01:02:38.571]  We keep hearing these rumors of guillotines, and I don't know why.
[01:02:38.571 --> 01:02:42.552]  I mean, doesn't he have pictures or something?
[01:02:42.552 --> 01:02:43.912]  Well, there's YouTubes of them.
[01:02:43.912 --> 01:02:46.013]  Just type in guillotine and use the...
[01:02:46.493 --> 01:02:49.996]  I'm not sure I can even spell it because according to the Clorox Corporation I'm a retard since I'm a male.
[01:03:02.367 --> 01:03:10.029]  As it pertains to my case, as it pertains to the case of James Martin Malone, who was taken from here without even so much as seeing any official.
[01:03:10.029 --> 01:03:13.290]  I just grabbed him and took him, you know, Mafia style.
[01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:20.353]  The most important thing is for people to know that any time you see the word extradition, it's part of a non-existent mythology.
[01:03:20.353 --> 01:03:21.113]  It's a mythology.
[01:03:21.113 --> 01:03:22.513]  We don't have extraditions anymore.
[01:03:22.513 --> 01:03:23.374]  We have kidnappings.
[01:03:23.374 --> 01:03:24.354]  They're not extraditions.
[01:03:24.654 --> 01:03:38.560]  It's a shadow system of injustice that operates in parallel with the delusional fake justice system that's just for show for the public, but underneath it all there's this shadow rogue system of criminal mafia global government.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.301]  That's what's really running the show.
[01:03:41.301 --> 01:03:42.341]  You know what?
[01:03:42.341 --> 01:03:43.182]  They know that down here.
[01:03:43.182 --> 01:03:43.802]  They know that down here.
[01:03:43.802 --> 01:03:48.764]  You know, there's... You know, I haven't met any officials and I've...
[01:03:50.558 --> 01:03:51.479]  They know what's going on.
[01:03:51.479 --> 01:03:55.663]  You know, I met, I'm not going to say his name on the air because he's well known here.
[01:03:55.663 --> 01:03:58.666]  He very closely became the President of Ecuador himself.
[01:03:58.666 --> 01:04:01.029]  He is currently one of CREA's ministers.
[01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:05.953]  And I was up in his office and he took me to his conference room, which he and I alone.
[01:04:05.953 --> 01:04:08.656]  No security people, none of his subordinates, nobody.
[01:04:08.656 --> 01:04:11.039]  Just he and I. You've got one minute left.
[01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:15.993]  Okay, anyways, long and short of it, as he said to me, you know, we know this is going on.
[01:04:15.993 --> 01:04:19.175]  He compared my case, I was actually stunned, to St.
[01:04:19.175 --> 01:04:19.716]  John of the Cross.
[01:04:19.716 --> 01:04:23.278]  He said, this is a man that was tortured and put in prison and everything else, and out of it, St.
[01:04:23.278 --> 01:04:27.961]  John of the Cross wrote the most magnificent literature ever penned in the Spanish language.
[01:04:27.961 --> 01:04:31.444]  So, they know that the prison system in the U.S.
[01:04:31.444 --> 01:04:32.164]  is very hokey.
[01:04:32.164 --> 01:04:34.866]  They know it, and they express it in a variety of ways.
[01:04:34.866 --> 01:04:38.769]  Well, the website for Greg Tathan is HerbHealers.com.
[01:04:38.769 --> 01:04:39.830]  Did I get that right, Greg?
[01:04:40.570 --> 01:04:41.211]  Right.

[01:04:44.553 --> 01:04:53.680]  If you want to take advantage of his fascinating Amazon herbal products, just give him a plug for thanking him for coming on the show.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.540]  Greg, best to you.
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:55.261]  Stay safe.
[01:04:55.261 --> 01:04:59.264]  Keep us posted if any more action happens in Ecuador, all right?
[01:04:59.264 --> 01:04:59.584]  Very well.
[01:04:59.584 --> 01:05:00.105]  Will do.

[01:08:12.103 --> 01:08:13.384]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.384 --> 01:08:17.827]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:21.889]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.413 --> 01:08:27.636]  All right, continuing with the Alex Jones Show, this is the second hour.
[01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:45.047]  We just finished up an interview with Greg Caton, an American citizen who was kidnapped at gunpoint in Ecuador by the rogue United States government that runs like a global mafia, running kidnapping and assassination squads everywhere in the world, including domestically in the United States.
[01:08:46.363 --> 01:08:56.507]  If you think Michael Hastings' car just blew up for no reason, you know, you probably need to rethink that.
[01:08:56.507 --> 01:09:05.570]  We've got a clip here that we want to go to from an interview with Julian Assange, who was all of a sudden back in the news headlining a lot of news reports because of
[01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:08.472]  Of course, the Ed Snowden situation.
[01:09:08.472 --> 01:09:11.135]  Check out this interview, this segment.
[01:09:11.135 --> 01:09:15.020]  Let's go to the 8 minute and 40 second segment of this interview, guys.
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:16.161]  Go ahead and roll that.
[01:09:16.161 --> 01:09:21.026]  Look, there is no stopping the publishing process at this stage.
[01:09:21.026 --> 01:09:27.834]  Great care has been taken to make sure that Mr. Snowden can't be pressured by any state.
[01:09:29.135 --> 01:09:32.998]  To stop the publication process?
[01:09:32.998 --> 01:09:41.725]  I mean, the United States, by cancelling his passport, has left him, for the moment, marooned in Russia.
[01:09:41.725 --> 01:09:45.108]  Is that really a great outcome by the State Department?
[01:09:45.108 --> 01:09:46.429]  Is that really what it wanted to do?
[01:09:47.310 --> 01:09:52.196]  I think that every citizen has the right to their citizenship.
[01:09:52.196 --> 01:09:59.026]  To take someone's principal component of citizenship, their passport, away from them is a disgrace.
[01:09:59.026 --> 01:10:01.750]  Mr Snowden hasn't been convicted of anything.
[01:10:02.708 --> 01:10:06.410]  There are no international warrants out for his arrest.
[01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:10.793]  To take a passport from a young man in a difficult situation like that is a disgrace.
[01:10:10.793 --> 01:10:12.194]  He is a hero.
[01:10:12.194 --> 01:10:15.335]  He has told people of the world...
[01:10:21.579 --> 01:10:31.962]  Takes away Snowden's passport, marooning him, says Assange, in the Russian airport, and then the State Department accuses Russia of holding on to him.
[01:10:31.962 --> 01:10:37.963]  Well, it's the State Department that took his passport away, making it impossible for him to travel.
[01:10:37.963 --> 01:10:46.585]  So once again, the government is causing the problem that it's accusing Snowden of, or Russia of causing.
[01:10:46.585 --> 01:10:48.506]  So, and the other thing here is that
[01:10:49.346 --> 01:10:55.089]  Assange says that Snowden's information will get out, that it cannot be stopped.
[01:10:55.089 --> 01:11:11.918]  This is crucial because what you are witnessing here is a global war, an info war at the highest levels between truth tellers, citizens, global citizens who want to expose the darkest secrets of how government is actually run.
[01:11:13.163 --> 01:11:23.674]  And we're going to have Wayne Madsen, by the way, coming up in about 20 minutes to give us more details on some of the darkest secrets of how government is actually run.
[01:11:23.674 --> 01:11:31.383]  They say you should never ask a sausage maker how a sausage is made, otherwise you'll never eat it.
[01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:37.532]  Well, by the same token, you should never ask your government how it runs government.
[01:11:37.532 --> 01:11:42.114]  Because if you knew, you'd be outraged, you'd be marching on the Capitol.
[01:11:42.114 --> 01:12:01.443]  So what people like Julian Assange and Edward Snowden are doing is simply bringing these facts to the surface, to give the people the transparency that Obama promised to give people, but then betrayed people over by keeping, and in fact expanding, more secrets.
[01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:08.375]  So Snowden wants to bring this out in the public and he has taken steps.
[01:12:08.375 --> 01:12:09.776]  This is what's important to understand.
[01:12:09.776 --> 01:12:17.080]  He has taken steps to make sure that additional information will be leaked if anything happens to him.
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:23.144]  I think he has what I might call an info dead man switch in place.
[01:12:23.144 --> 01:12:27.787]  In fact, I'm 100% certain this is the case even though I don't have any inside info on it.
[01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:31.594]  If I were Snowden, I would do that.
[01:12:31.594 --> 01:12:43.072]  So if anything happens to him, if he winds up dead, gets blown up in a car like Hastings, or suddenly dies from a heart attack like Breitbart the day before he was going to release some damning information on Obama,
[01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:46.088]  Well then, guess what?
[01:12:46.088 --> 01:12:51.373]  The dead man switch is activated, and probably all kinds of damning information is going to get released.
[01:12:51.373 --> 01:13:03.925]  So right now, the US government needs to be thinking very carefully about how they're going to treat Edward Snowden, because if they try to go after him and kill him, I think they are going to probably set in motion some things that could
[01:13:05.555 --> 01:13:09.378]  Result in the downfall of the current criminal administration.
[01:13:09.378 --> 01:13:18.085]  Which is, of course, what Assange would probably like to see, and what Snowden would like to see, and I think many freedom lovers everywhere would like to see.
[01:13:18.085 --> 01:13:21.888]  Let's go on to some other news, and then we'll come back to some clips in a minute, but check this out.
[01:13:21.888 --> 01:13:29.815]  The teen that was charged for wearing an NRA t-shirt has had the charges dismissed against him.
[01:13:30.951 --> 01:13:33.572]  A 14-year-old student named Jared Markham.
[01:13:33.572 --> 01:13:42.236]  The charges have been dismissed by a judge who was facing one year in jail for wearing a shirt that said to protect your First Amendment.
[01:13:42.236 --> 01:13:44.797]  I mean, look at the irony of that.
[01:13:44.797 --> 01:13:48.659]  Arrested for saying protect our constitutional rights.
[01:13:48.659 --> 01:13:53.802]  Arrested by a police officer who swore an oath to defend the Constitution.
[01:13:54.762 --> 01:13:58.449]  And then arrested the teen for wearing a t-shirt that says defend the Constitution.
[01:13:58.449 --> 01:14:00.393]  This is how crazy it has become.
[01:14:00.393 --> 01:14:04.801]  That story is up on InfoWars.com by Paul Joseph Watson right now.
[01:14:07.234 --> 01:14:18.842]  By the way, another important point about that story is that the judge imposed a gag order that would have prevented Markham from discussing anything about the case in public.
[01:14:18.842 --> 01:14:27.829]  Because, of course, you can't allow someone who's wearing a t-shirt that says protect the First Amendment to have the First Amendment right.
[01:14:27.829 --> 01:14:30.991]  That would just be too much freedom in America!
[01:14:30.991 --> 01:14:31.812]  Too much freedom!
[01:14:32.392 --> 01:14:34.434]  You can't give people too much freedom.
[01:14:34.434 --> 01:14:36.755]  Alright, here's another story that will blow your mind.
[01:14:36.755 --> 01:14:39.538]  Again, there's no way we can even cover all this today.
[01:14:39.538 --> 01:14:53.208]  Hospitals and cancer centers are now getting women drunk at mammogram parties, liquoring them up so that they can then get mammograms that give them a false diagnosis of cancer.
[01:14:53.208 --> 01:14:57.652]  This is being called a form of medical date rape.
[01:14:57.652 --> 01:14:59.953]  Yeah, medical date rape.
[01:15:01.235 --> 01:15:06.399]  And I wouldn't be surprised if lots of women come out and defend this practice.
[01:15:06.399 --> 01:15:12.064]  Yeah, we have the right to get drunk and then get irradiated with mammograms.
[01:15:12.064 --> 01:15:18.309]  And then get dosed up with chemotherapy and have our breasts removed surgically with double mastectomies.
[01:15:18.309 --> 01:15:19.170]  That's our right!
[01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:24.054]  I wouldn't be surprised to find some women out there doing that.
[01:15:25.684 --> 01:15:29.707]  Oh, it's just another medical abuse and exploitation of women.
[01:15:29.707 --> 01:15:32.269]  Where does it end, folks?
[01:15:32.269 --> 01:15:33.770]  Where does it end?
[01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:44.138]  And those of us who try to speak up for women and try to speak up for civil rights and for human rights and for freedoms, we're always labeled sexist and racist.
[01:15:44.138 --> 01:15:45.760]  Oh, we're so terrible!
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:51.002]  For mentioning that everybody's rights should be equally protected.
[01:15:51.002 --> 01:15:56.424]  Alright, major change coming to the security lines at Denver International Airport.
[01:15:56.424 --> 01:16:00.525]  They've got dogs sniffing you now.
[01:16:00.525 --> 01:16:01.506]  TSA dogs.
[01:16:04.028 --> 01:16:17.377]  We could offer some inappropriate jokes on this, but I'll skip it, but the dogs are apparently easy to train to sniff you in the same areas that the TSA is normally touching.
[01:16:17.377 --> 01:16:20.859]  So, wow, very useful to sniff you.
[01:16:20.859 --> 01:16:29.485]  And of course, they managed to find some passengers that were raving about, oh, we love the dogs sniffing us as if we're criminals carrying drugs all the time.
[01:16:29.485 --> 01:16:33.468]  All right, Colorado's gun control laws go into effect
[01:16:34.148 --> 01:16:35.449]  Monday!
[01:16:35.449 --> 01:16:39.312]  That's today.
[01:16:39.312 --> 01:16:40.273]  Either today or next week.
[01:16:40.273 --> 01:16:41.934]  I'll have to check it out.
[01:16:41.934 --> 01:16:52.063]  So, you're not going to be able to buy guns without going through a universal background check, which means you can't even sell a gun to your own son, or family member, or father, or uncle.
[01:16:53.356 --> 01:16:54.437]  I don't know.
[01:17:09.008 --> 01:17:14.791]  Your rifle can only have 15 rounds in it, while the meth heads can have 30.
[01:17:14.791 --> 01:17:17.013]  Or 100, even.
[01:17:17.013 --> 01:17:27.259]  So, this bill is going to put law-abiding citizens at a tactical disadvantage against criminal gangs, which is, of course, the whole point of gun control.
[01:17:27.259 --> 01:17:29.960]  To turn everybody into a victim.
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:32.042]  And that story, by the way, is out of the Denver Post.
[01:17:33.351 --> 01:17:35.132]  All right, a story from Ron Paul.
[01:17:35.132 --> 01:17:39.235]  If you like the surveillance state, you'll love E-Verify.
[01:17:39.235 --> 01:17:47.942]  Part of the government's new mandate for employers is E-Verify that requires Americans to carry a
[01:17:48.562 --> 01:17:53.667]  Quote, tamper proof social security card in order to get a job.
[01:17:53.667 --> 01:18:10.723]  So you got to show the card to your employer and then the employer has to verify the eligibility by running it through a federal database, which means the federal government will then have a log, a record of every person where they were on what day applying for which job.
[01:18:10.723 --> 01:18:11.264]  How's that?
[01:18:11.264 --> 01:18:11.904]  Isn't that wonderful?
[01:18:12.944 --> 01:18:17.526]  Just more police state antics from the Obama administration.
[01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:22.828]  Now the UK government has banned GMOs from Parliament, but forces them on the public.
[01:18:22.828 --> 01:18:23.588]  Isn't this interesting?
[01:18:23.588 --> 01:18:27.489]  You know how Monsanto banned GMOs from its own cafeteria?
[01:18:27.489 --> 01:18:31.611]  And you know the global elite, they don't eat GMOs, they eat all organics.
[01:18:31.611 --> 01:18:40.174]  They drink raw milk, not pasteurized processed milk, but of course they always say that the public should eat the things that they won't, because
[01:18:40.774 --> 01:18:43.635]  You know, the poisons have got to go somewhere.
[01:18:43.635 --> 01:18:48.856]  How would they get rid of them if they didn't have people eat them all the time?
[01:18:48.856 --> 01:18:55.497]  So, GMOs banned from Parliament, but still good enough for the common people.
[01:18:55.497 --> 01:19:00.398]  But hey, at least Europe is, you know, banning more GMOs than the United States.
[01:19:00.398 --> 01:19:06.859]  I think GMOs are required to be labeled in something like 56 countries around the world?
[01:19:06.859 --> 01:19:07.319]  Something like that?
[01:19:08.424 --> 01:19:10.085]  But not in America, no!
[01:19:10.085 --> 01:19:19.029]  Moving on, next story, the NSA can obtain one billion cell phone calls a day and store them and listen to them.
[01:19:19.029 --> 01:19:28.813]  This is more information coming out of the Guardian and Glenn Greenwald, the journalist that has been covering the Ed Snowden situation.
[01:19:28.813 --> 01:19:31.575]  And, by the way, I want to talk about...
[01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:33.755]  We're going to break.
[01:19:33.755 --> 01:19:37.816]  We'll do that when we get back, but last piece here in this segment.
[01:19:37.816 --> 01:19:46.138]  The implementation of online insurance exchanges, this is the Obamacare Insurance Exchange, could be worse than the Y2K predictions.
[01:19:46.138 --> 01:19:54.620]  Y2K was a walk in the park compared to the state insurance exchanges, which are undoubtedly not going to be ready in time, which I think is October 1.
[01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:59.701]  So get ready for those to crash and burn while you're trying to get your Obama-mandated health insurance.
[01:19:59.701 --> 01:20:00.161]  Stay with us.
[01:20:00.161 --> 01:20:00.741]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:01.192 --> 01:20:05.974]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:20:05.974 --> 01:20:08.995]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:20:08.995 --> 01:20:17.958]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:20:17.958 --> 01:20:22.880]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:20:23.496 --> 01:20:34.888]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.

[01:22:52.029 --> 01:23:04.185]  Hi, this is Gary Cooper with Midas Resources Gold and Silver.
[01:23:04.185 --> 01:23:08.310]  Don't be surprised when the global elite confiscates money from your bank account one day.
[01:23:08.570 --> 01:23:12.151]  They have already very clearly telling you that they're going to do it.
[01:23:12.151 --> 01:23:16.432]  With what just happened in Cyprus serving as a blueprint for future bank bailouts.
[01:23:16.432 --> 01:23:21.734]  If you are concerned about keeping your money, why not consider storing your wealth in gold and silver?
[01:23:21.734 --> 01:23:28.656]  Call me, Gary Cooper, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 130.
[01:23:28.656 --> 01:23:31.777]  Together we'll discuss your options of buying gold and silver.
[01:23:31.777 --> 01:23:35.858]  Again, the global elite have plans for your money and it doesn't include you.
[01:23:35.858 --> 01:23:37.639]  So call me, Gary Cooper, at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:38.459 --> 01:23:40.121]  Call me, Gary Cooper, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 130.
[01:24:10.158 --> 01:24:15.905]  Welcome back.
[01:24:15.905 --> 01:24:17.947]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:17.947 --> 01:24:20.230]  I want to remind you to help support this broadcast.
[01:24:20.230 --> 01:24:22.653]  Check out the Pro-Pure water filters.
[01:24:22.653 --> 01:24:23.213]  10% off right now.
[01:24:24.054 --> 01:24:29.459]  These are the only water filters that have an integrated fluoride filter that removes most of the fluoride, not all of it.
[01:24:29.459 --> 01:24:34.263]  It's very difficult to get that out, but most of it, greatly reducing your exposure to it.
[01:24:34.263 --> 01:24:38.427]  You can check that out at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:24:38.427 --> 01:24:41.950]  Also, this video, State of Mind, the psychology of control is coming out.
[01:24:42.651 --> 01:24:43.552]  This looks amazing.
[01:24:43.552 --> 01:24:54.638]  In fact, I'm going to steal this copy, probably, and take it with me, because I've been hearing interviews here on Alex Jones by the creators of this film, and they are smart guys.
[01:24:54.638 --> 01:24:55.578]  Brilliant, actually.
[01:24:55.578 --> 01:24:57.819]  And I'm really looking forward to seeing this film.
[01:24:57.819 --> 01:24:59.300]  It's got all kinds of great people in it.
[01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:01.842]  John Rappaport, Ed Griffin, and many others.
[01:25:01.842 --> 01:25:03.703]  Alex Jones is in the film as well.
[01:25:03.703 --> 01:25:04.563]  State of Mind.
[01:25:04.563 --> 01:25:05.243]  Check that out.
[01:25:05.243 --> 01:25:09.086]  It's on sale right now, but shipping, I think, later.
[01:25:10.346 --> 01:25:13.247]  It's available for sale now, but shipping in a few days, something like that.
[01:25:13.247 --> 01:25:14.027]  Is that right, guys?
[01:25:14.027 --> 01:25:16.088]  Shipping later?
[01:25:16.088 --> 01:25:19.369]  Well, anyway, check it out on InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:25:19.369 --> 01:25:29.792]  We've also got the Survival Seed Center there at InfoWarsStore, and InfoWarsHealth.com, where you can check out the many health products that are recommended by people like Ben Fuchs, who I really love his information.
[01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:31.412]  The guy is absolutely brilliant.
[01:25:31.412 --> 01:25:34.513]  You've got Enterfood, Superfood Products, the Survival Seed Vault.
[01:25:35.962 --> 01:25:37.723]  Beyond Tangy Tangerine, many other products there.
[01:25:37.723 --> 01:25:39.843]  Check it out at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:25:39.843 --> 01:25:44.345]  Your support helps support this show and makes this possible.
[01:25:44.345 --> 01:25:50.367]  Because, remember, the alternative media is now the new mainstream media.
[01:25:50.367 --> 01:25:59.410]  So, InfoWars, Natural News, Drudge Report, people like Gerald Cilenti and others, we are really the new journalism.
[01:25:59.410 --> 01:26:04.892]  Because we're the ones who are out there telling the truth and not just parroting White House lies and deceptions.
[01:26:05.788 --> 01:26:19.481]  And I know there are others out there that are trying to be kind of alternative media, like RT, but then RT went off and attacked the Second Amendment, totally discrediting themselves in that process, saying that we should turn in our guns and things like that.
[01:26:19.481 --> 01:26:30.090]  So, I'm not ever going on there again, because I'm not going to support a foreign-funded media that's trying to take away our constitutional rights.
[01:26:32.926 --> 01:26:34.127]  I'm just not going to participate in that.
[01:26:34.127 --> 01:26:42.093]  I'm going to support people like Alex Jones and InfoWars who are about liberty and who don't have some big corporate boss telling them what to do.
[01:26:42.093 --> 01:26:44.015]  That's the thing you've got to realize.
[01:26:44.015 --> 01:26:46.297]  See, Alex Jones has no boss.
[01:26:46.297 --> 01:26:48.418]  He can't be fired.
[01:26:48.418 --> 01:26:49.499]  You are his boss.
[01:26:49.499 --> 01:26:51.201]  You, the listeners, you are his boss.
[01:26:52.262 --> 01:26:53.122]  I'm in the same boat.
[01:26:53.122 --> 01:26:54.083]  I have no boss.
[01:26:54.083 --> 01:26:54.783]  I can't be fired.
[01:26:54.783 --> 01:26:58.824]  That's why I can write stories about Rachel Jeantel.
[01:26:58.824 --> 01:27:02.485]  I can be critical of things that are not politically correct.
[01:27:02.485 --> 01:27:04.646]  I refuse to be censored by political correctness.
[01:27:04.646 --> 01:27:16.150]  I can have intelligent discussion about topics that will get me called a racist for mentioning that maybe we should stop attacking, you know, white people for everything in the media.
[01:27:16.670 --> 01:27:18.333]  You know, I'm gonna get called a racist for that.
[01:27:18.333 --> 01:27:19.174]  I don't care.
[01:27:19.174 --> 01:27:21.277]  Because we're winning at so many levels.
[01:27:21.277 --> 01:27:22.740]  We are gaining the audience.
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:25.304]  We're growing in influence.
[01:27:25.304 --> 01:27:27.146]  We are the ones who are telling the truth.
[01:27:27.146 --> 01:27:28.769]  And thank you for your support.
[01:27:28.769 --> 01:27:29.911]  We're here to serve you.
[01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:31.433]  That's why we do this.
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.021]  Alex and I have had these conversations.
[01:27:35.021 --> 01:27:42.643]  If everything was okay in the world, we would both probably be at our farms on a John Deere tractor, you know, farming.
[01:27:42.643 --> 01:27:45.344]  We wouldn't even be doing this.
[01:27:45.344 --> 01:27:48.185]  We do this because we have to serve humanity.
[01:27:48.185 --> 01:27:54.348]  We have to shine the light on basic freedoms, fundamental, the philosophy of liberty.
[01:27:54.348 --> 01:27:55.848]  This is worth fighting for.
[01:27:55.848 --> 01:27:57.689]  That's why we're here fighting for this.
[01:27:57.689 --> 01:27:59.769]  So thank you for your support.
[01:27:59.769 --> 01:28:00.650]  We're going to keep doing this.
[01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:04.752]  For as long as we can.
[01:28:04.752 --> 01:28:10.274]  And help pass the torch on to the next generation of people who can take over this job and continue it.
[01:28:10.274 --> 01:28:13.596]  Because this is a never-ending fight for liberty and freedom.
[01:28:13.596 --> 01:28:19.939]  And don't be fooled by fake alternative media that are actually funded by foreign governments, okay?
[01:28:19.939 --> 01:28:21.980]  Now, let's move on to some other news.
[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:23.501]  HIV vaccine...
[01:28:24.682 --> 01:28:28.423]  Experiment infects 41 volunteers.
[01:28:28.423 --> 01:28:30.143]  So, get this.
[01:28:30.143 --> 01:28:43.707]  The NIH-certified study included 2,500 men who were having sex with other men, according to the release, or having sex with transgender individuals.
[01:28:43.707 --> 01:28:46.807]  They were assigned to receive the experimental vaccine HVTN505.
[01:28:49.585 --> 01:28:51.167]  Sounds like someone's license plate.
[01:28:51.167 --> 01:28:52.589]  And the other half were given a placebo.
[01:28:52.589 --> 01:28:57.614]  Well, it turns out that 41 of the men who were given the vaccine actually were given HIV.
[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:00.800]  Wow.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:09.102]  So once again, more proof that the vaccines give you the diseases that they claim to be stopping.
[01:29:09.102 --> 01:29:22.406]  And it reminds me of last year, the Merck scientists came out in a whistleblower lawsuit against Merck that said Merck knew its measles vaccines were causing measles.
[01:29:22.406 --> 01:29:27.367]  That its vaccines were not effective at blocking the diseases that it claimed to block.
[01:29:27.987 --> 01:29:32.610]  And so that lawsuit, I don't know where it's gone since then, but that was filed last year.
[01:29:32.610 --> 01:29:39.836]  Vaccines are a vector to infect you with the disease that they claim to be blocking, okay?
[01:29:39.836 --> 01:29:42.698]  If you get vaccines, you're poisoning yourself.
[01:29:42.698 --> 01:29:44.479]  That's all there is to it.
[01:29:44.479 --> 01:29:46.380]  The proof is out there.
[01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:47.021]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:47.021 --> 01:29:48.562]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:48.562 --> 01:29:50.083]  Wayne Madsen, straight ahead.
[01:29:50.083 --> 01:29:51.464]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.464 --> 01:29:54.006]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.006 --> 01:29:56.668]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.888 --> 01:30:05.615]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:30:05.615 --> 01:30:08.739]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:30:08.739 --> 01:30:14.307]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:30:14.307 --> 01:30:15.909]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:17.870]  We are what we eat.
[01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:22.533]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:30:22.533 --> 01:30:26.756]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:30:26.756 --> 01:30:29.318]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:30:29.318 --> 01:30:35.562]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:31:29.231 --> 01:31:36.534]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[01:31:36.534 --> 01:31:47.459]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera, to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin, while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:32:01.630 --> 01:32:05.113]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[01:32:05.113 --> 01:32:08.455]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[01:32:08.455 --> 01:32:11.077]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[01:32:11.077 --> 01:32:14.480]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:20.705]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.
[01:32:21.005 --> 01:32:22.928]  Wonder if there'll really be a problem?

[01:33:11.946 --> 01:33:18.194]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:20.729 --> 01:33:22.731]  We're continuing on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.731 --> 01:33:23.632]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:33:23.632 --> 01:33:27.275]  This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in for Alex.
[01:33:27.275 --> 01:33:30.437]  He'll be back tomorrow.
[01:33:30.437 --> 01:33:33.219]  He's off today, so thanks for tuning in.
[01:33:33.219 --> 01:33:35.321]  We've got Wayne Madsen coming up right now.
[01:33:35.321 --> 01:33:40.345]  Now, Madsen is, of course, an NSA insider.
[01:33:40.345 --> 01:33:41.506]  He's got a lot of information.
[01:33:41.506 --> 01:33:45.249]  He's been a frequent guest on this show, and he's been on the money, on the mark.
[01:33:46.130 --> 01:33:50.073]  Every time, with everything that he has said, it's all come out.
[01:33:50.073 --> 01:33:51.795]  It's all come true.
[01:33:51.795 --> 01:34:08.488]  And he was involved, I believe, in the leaking of information to the press in the EU that recently broke, we'll let him clarify that if I'm wrong, about the US government spying on its own allies, European governments.
[01:34:09.545 --> 01:34:16.110]  And there's some controversy about that story, and here to help explain and navigate that is Wayne Madsen himself.
[01:34:16.110 --> 01:34:18.772]  Mr. Madsen, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:18.772 --> 01:34:22.976]  It's great to have you back on.
[01:34:22.976 --> 01:34:23.836]  Can you hear me, sir?
[01:34:23.836 --> 01:34:27.339]  I don't think he can hear me.
[01:34:27.339 --> 01:34:28.900]  Can you hear me, Wayne?
[01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:30.402]  I can not hear you, no.
[01:34:30.402 --> 01:34:32.383]  All right, good to hear you.
[01:34:32.383 --> 01:34:33.204]  Welcome to the show, sir.
[01:34:34.210 --> 01:34:35.491]  Good to be with you.
[01:34:35.491 --> 01:34:36.772]  Good to hear your voice.
[01:34:36.772 --> 01:34:47.918]  Now, you've been spot on with your predictions, but tell us, what is the deal with, I think, The Guardian pulling its story that it initially published, announcing that the U.S.
[01:34:47.918 --> 01:34:49.579]  government was spying on its European allies?
[01:34:49.579 --> 01:34:52.100]  What's the story behind that story?
[01:34:52.100 --> 01:35:01.706]  Well, the story behind the story, unfortunately, what I told The Observer, and it's a sister newspaper, The Guardian, they're owned by the same company,
[01:35:03.570 --> 01:35:31.182]  I told the reporter for The Observer, I said, look, German Chancellor Merkel and French President Hollande are crying about the fact that this cable tap was discovered because of the Ed Snowden revelations on a transatlantic 14 cable that goes from Denmark to the Netherlands to Germany to Belgium to France and then over to the UK and then to Tuckerton, New Jersey.
[01:35:33.023 --> 01:35:39.744]  They said, oh, you're spying on the communications of German and French citizens.
[01:35:39.744 --> 01:35:57.208]  When in fact, both these countries, Germany to a much bigger extent than France, have been engaged in providing signals intelligence data, including information tapped from submarine cables to the NSA for decades.
[01:35:57.208 --> 01:35:58.228]  And it hasn't stopped.
[01:35:59.426 --> 01:36:11.413]  You know, they're crying crocodile tears because what they don't want their own populations to know is that they themselves are spying on their own citizens and some of this information.
[01:36:12.114 --> 01:36:30.747]  I would suggest a large part of the information is being sent to NSA that's so overwhelmed with data now they have to build a 17 football field data center in Utah that can handle one yottabyte, and don't ask me how many zeros are after that number, one yottabyte of data.
[01:36:30.747 --> 01:36:36.091]  But this is why I told the Observer, I gave them two declassified documents.
[01:36:36.832 --> 01:36:38.293]  I don't have any classified documents.
[01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:48.685]  I haven't worked at NSA for a long, long time, but I also know what's declassified and what those documents meant at the time they were still classified.
[01:36:48.685 --> 01:36:57.514]  What's interesting though, Wayne, is that the things that you've been saying and the declassified documents that you are able to access and acquire
[01:36:58.155 --> 01:37:04.341]  They suddenly have more relevance and context in the context of Ed Snowden going public with his revelation.
[01:37:04.341 --> 01:37:12.729]  So now suddenly, are you finding that the press, the mainstream media, is taking you more seriously as well for the things that you've been warning on for years?
[01:37:13.188 --> 01:37:16.311]  Well, to the contrary, yes.
[01:37:16.311 --> 01:37:18.513]  Now, one thing about the Observer.
[01:37:18.513 --> 01:37:20.194]  They contacted me.
[01:37:20.194 --> 01:37:28.162]  There's been some suggestions that the Observer got their information from another blog, and I gave an interview to the person who runs that blog.
[01:37:28.162 --> 01:37:30.504]  That's Simon Davies, an old friend of mine.
[01:37:30.504 --> 01:37:33.827]  He used to head up Privacy International.
[01:37:33.827 --> 01:37:37.030]  I'm still on the International Advisory Board of Privacy International.
[01:37:37.410 --> 01:37:45.452]  But we discussed ways to advance this story and show the hypocrisy of the French and the British in this matter.
[01:37:45.452 --> 01:37:49.532]  And, you know, the Observer was contacted.
[01:37:49.532 --> 01:37:55.393]  I gave an interview to Simon Davies, who put it on the privacysurgeon.com website.
[01:37:55.393 --> 01:37:59.414]  And then the Observer called me to verify everything I said.
[01:37:59.414 --> 01:38:00.054]  And I did.
[01:38:00.054 --> 01:38:03.335]  And they all had these declassified documents.
[01:38:03.815 --> 01:38:08.641]  The Observer came back and said, look, we understand that you've written some controversial things in the past.
[01:38:08.641 --> 01:38:10.023]  I said, yeah, to say the least.
[01:38:10.023 --> 01:38:13.086]  I don't work at NSA anymore.
[01:38:13.086 --> 01:38:15.769]  I make my living as a journalist.
[01:38:15.769 --> 01:38:17.932]  I do muckraking journalism.
[01:38:17.932 --> 01:38:21.116]  And that's very uncomfortable to certain chardonnay-swilling
[01:38:21.656 --> 01:38:30.663]  People, you know, inhabit the expensive clubs and restaurants of Manhattan and D.C.
[01:38:30.663 --> 01:38:33.425]  But, you know, that's what I do for a living.
[01:38:33.425 --> 01:38:35.826]  So they were aware of this.
[01:38:35.826 --> 01:38:46.354]  They said they ran my quotes to the legal department of the male and guardian corporate parent.
[01:38:46.354 --> 01:38:47.615]  They signed off on it.
[01:38:48.877 --> 01:38:59.174]  The editors signed off on it, and then when the story hits, the Guardian of course put it on their website, and then it was on the first edition, the print edition, of the Observer, the Sunday Observer.
[01:38:59.174 --> 01:39:01.738]  So why did they pull it off of the online edition then?
[01:39:02.233 --> 01:39:15.060]  Well, they not only pulled it off the online version, but the second print run of the Observer, they dropped my picture on the front page for one of an old and haggard looking Mick Jagger.
[01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:19.962]  You know, I mean, but it was too late.
[01:39:19.962 --> 01:39:22.744]  And see, I got a call saying,
[01:39:23.428 --> 01:39:25.608]  It's too late.
[01:39:25.608 --> 01:39:32.550]  The Observer has already gone from, it's already running in the presses and it goes on to the trucks and out to what the British call the news agents.
[01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:38.151]  They're the sidewalk stands and the places that sell news around Britain.
[01:39:38.151 --> 01:39:45.452]  So it was out there and so it's easy to pull a website but it's very hard to pull a print edition.
[01:39:45.452 --> 01:39:47.053]  You can come out with a new edition.
[01:39:47.053 --> 01:39:48.753]  It cost them a lot of money to do this.
[01:39:48.753 --> 01:39:49.473]  Why did they do it?
[01:39:50.231 --> 01:40:19.671]  I have to figure that I created a firestorm with my revelations about the Germans and the French because one of the biggest German newspapers, Die Welt, also put it on their website with a picture of Angela Merkel with my caption underneath of my quote stating that Merkel complaining about spying was like the Inspector Reynaud in the movie Casablanca complaining that there was gambling going on
[01:40:28.098 --> 01:40:36.805]  But all of these countries, I think we just lost connection with Wayne, all of these countries are spying on each other to the extent that they can.
[01:40:36.805 --> 01:40:46.494]  But as Wayne Madsen was just explaining there, then they deny that they're doing any spying on their own citizens because, oh my God, you know, denial is the name of the game.
[01:40:46.494 --> 01:40:47.495]  You have to deny everything.
[01:40:48.135 --> 01:40:52.818]  By the way, this is a good opportunity to give out the phone number because I did want to take some calls for Wayne Madsen.
[01:40:52.818 --> 01:40:57.481]  So if you'd like to call in, the number is 800-259-9231.
[01:40:57.481 --> 01:41:01.604]  Yep, that's it.
[01:41:01.604 --> 01:41:02.725]  800-259-9231.
[01:41:02.725 --> 01:41:11.791]  And I'd like to take a couple of questions for Wayne Madsen when he gets back on here, but also I'd like to take some of your questions personally at the top of the next hour.
[01:41:11.791 --> 01:41:13.092]  We're going to cover a lot more news.
[01:41:13.092 --> 01:41:16.755]  We've also got a segment on the rise of the machines that I want to go through with you.
[01:41:17.495 --> 01:41:22.536]  Which explains why you, why the future doesn't need you.
[01:41:22.536 --> 01:41:34.539]  And in the meantime, check this out, Facebook censorship is continuing and they censor anyone who talks about the Second Amendment, Chick-fil-A, Jesus, the NRA.
[01:41:34.539 --> 01:41:40.721]  These are all key concepts that will get you banned and now Todd Starnes of Fox News reports that Facebook has blocked
[01:41:41.241 --> 01:41:46.623]  His postings because he posted support for the National Rifle Association.
[01:41:46.623 --> 01:41:51.145]  Facebook then later apparently apologized for blocking that.
[01:41:51.145 --> 01:41:53.446]  Yeah, see, they just block it by default.
[01:41:53.446 --> 01:42:05.350]  And then if you're powerful enough to reach the Facebook legal team, which is very, very difficult to do, then they might, they might retract that and take off the block of your account.
[01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:06.391]  But that's only after the fact.
[01:42:07.091 --> 01:42:09.613]  By default, they block everything.
[01:42:09.613 --> 01:42:16.638]  And Facebook, by the way, has largely degenerated into a cesspool of trolls.
[01:42:16.638 --> 01:42:25.565]  And I tell you, when we post things on Facebook, the comments are so inane, they are the most
[01:42:28.323 --> 01:42:33.147]  It's like these people, it's like they're not real, it's like they're computer algorithms generated.
[01:42:33.147 --> 01:42:34.708]  Seriously, and I think many of them are.
[01:42:34.708 --> 01:42:44.976]  I think something like a third of the accounts on Facebook are actually just computer systems that are just posting nonsense based on the keywords that you put out there.
[01:42:44.976 --> 01:42:50.561]  That's why they seem so stupid, because these algorithms are not very advanced.
[01:42:53.129 --> 01:42:55.632]  In any case, we have Wayne Madsen back.
[01:42:55.632 --> 01:42:58.756]  The connection is a little dicey there, but he's back with us.
[01:42:58.756 --> 01:43:09.588]  So Wayne, picking up where you left off there, my question to you is, you know, why aren't the people of Germany and France thrilled that the NSA is spying on them?
[01:43:09.588 --> 01:43:12.692]  Because the NSA should be keeping them safe, just like they do Americans.
[01:43:13.055 --> 01:43:14.235]  Well, that's what's happened.
[01:43:14.235 --> 01:43:22.638]  See, a lot of these, all these arrangements with the Germans and the French and the Dutch and the Danes and everyone else, they were done during the Cold War.
[01:43:22.638 --> 01:43:24.219]  But remember what happened.
[01:43:24.219 --> 01:43:33.122]  The Soviet Union, which was a much overplayed threat, you know, during the Cold War, disappears and they need a new, a new enemy.
[01:43:33.986 --> 01:43:39.368]  And it became terrorism, specifically global jihadist terrorism.
[01:43:39.368 --> 01:43:44.170]  And you know, let's not talk about who has funded these terrorist groups over the years.
[01:43:44.170 --> 01:43:49.612]  Al Qaeda, which was organized by the CIA to fight the Soviets, the Taliban.
[01:43:50.032 --> 01:43:50.132]  Was
[01:44:08.334 --> 01:44:22.941]  But, they serve the purpose of providing that enemy, that suspicious, mysterious enemy that the governments need to basically cow their populations and live in a state of fear.
[01:44:22.941 --> 01:44:26.422]  Just like out of 1984.
[01:44:26.422 --> 01:44:36.307]  Is there any indication that the Observer slash Guardian is going to reinstate that story, or are they now too afraid to actually print the truth on this topic?
[01:44:36.741 --> 01:44:47.961]  Well, what happened was, after they printed the story, and as I said, this was vetted, you know, my past as a journalist was well known to them, people who say they didn't bother checking
[01:44:51.775 --> 01:44:52.896]  We're good to go.
[01:45:10.210 --> 01:45:13.532]  They're not spying on terrorism.
[01:45:13.532 --> 01:45:23.236]  As a matter of fact, you hear Merkel and Hollande complaining about the Americans are spying on us during sensitive EU-American trade negotiations.
[01:45:23.236 --> 01:45:23.756]  Aha!
[01:45:23.756 --> 01:45:24.777]  That's what it's all about!
[01:45:25.337 --> 01:45:26.718]  That's what it's all about.
[01:45:26.718 --> 01:45:31.981]  They're afraid we're going to get a leg up on them on trade negotiations.
[01:45:31.981 --> 01:45:42.967]  In other words, Merkel cares more about Volkswagens coming to the United States and Hollande about French Brie sales to the United States than they are the spying on their own people.
[01:45:42.967 --> 01:45:43.688]  Sure, right.
[01:45:43.948 --> 01:45:45.029]  We're good to go.
[01:45:59.847 --> 01:46:00.548]  On soap opera.
[01:46:00.548 --> 01:46:02.929]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:02.929 --> 01:46:04.230]  It's a great act they put on.
[01:46:04.230 --> 01:46:05.591]  They have the acting experience.
[01:46:05.591 --> 01:46:08.473]  Let me get your take on this and then we'll go to some calls for you, Wayne.
[01:46:08.473 --> 01:46:16.339]  The Register has announced that the Department of Defense is setting up a sentient world psyop simulator.
[01:46:16.339 --> 01:46:21.182]  That's a massive computer system that simulates the decision process of all individuals
[01:46:22.123 --> 01:46:23.725]  On the planet.
[01:46:23.725 --> 01:46:28.309]  And it even simulates media outlets and utilities and financial institutions and so on.
[01:46:28.309 --> 01:46:33.513]  It's going to use this to test PsyOps to see how the population might react.
[01:46:33.513 --> 01:46:36.596]  What do you think about this PsyOps simulator?
[01:46:36.596 --> 01:46:41.080]  Well, it makes The Matrix, the movie The Matrix, look like a documentary of future events.
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:41.280]  Right.
[01:46:43.036 --> 01:46:47.218]  I mean, you know, this is our money being wasted on this crap.
[01:46:47.218 --> 01:46:51.599]  That's the only, you know, that's the only word I can use to describe it.
[01:46:51.599 --> 01:46:53.300]  You know, PSYOP simulators.
[01:46:53.300 --> 01:46:59.582]  What's the matter with the real PSYOP people, all the sock puppets, some of which attacked me immediately, by the way.
[01:46:59.582 --> 01:47:06.885]  I think part of what the Guardian, you know, and the Observer, what they reacted to was this same group that went after Dan Rather, you remember.
[01:47:07.725 --> 01:47:10.227]  Sitting there ready, waiting to go after people.
[01:47:10.227 --> 01:47:11.868]  They dig, they dig, they dig.
[01:47:11.868 --> 01:47:17.172]  Well, this is real psyops, but I guess these people, you know, they have to take a break sometimes.
[01:47:17.172 --> 01:47:19.173]  They gotta eat, they gotta go to the bathroom.
[01:47:19.173 --> 01:47:28.820]  So it's better, I guess, for these intelligence agencies to have, you know, some mechanism that doesn't take potty breaks and smoke breaks.
[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:30.381]  Well, right, and it's faster.
[01:47:30.381 --> 01:47:34.865]  I mean, they can test something and see how they think it might operate before they actually try a rollout.
[01:47:35.794 --> 01:47:36.534]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:36.534 --> 01:47:37.075]  Exactly.
[01:47:37.075 --> 01:47:52.805]  But look, you know, if the American public, you know, I love, you know, Rand Paul, he talks about how the government wastes money on, you know, robotic squirrels and the mating habits of, you know, bumblebees and all this other stuff.
[01:47:52.805 --> 01:47:53.586]  But the American people
[01:47:53.626 --> 01:47:53.926]  I don't know.
[01:48:17.346 --> 01:48:18.367]  Did he get the information?
[01:48:18.367 --> 01:48:21.190]  He got it from a Trekkie website and sold it to the Air Force.
[01:48:21.190 --> 01:48:23.132]  Great.
[01:48:23.132 --> 01:48:24.554]  Hey, we should get into that racket, huh?
[01:48:24.554 --> 01:48:27.317]  Let's take some phone calls.
[01:48:27.317 --> 01:48:29.500]  As remote viewers, you know, clairvoyance.
[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:30.861]  That's right.
[01:48:30.861 --> 01:48:32.083]  Go talk to dead people.
[01:48:33.584 --> 01:48:38.686]  Yeah, well, maybe those are the people that have the secrets.
[01:48:38.686 --> 01:48:40.207]  They've been killed.
[01:48:40.207 --> 01:48:48.251]  I'd like to ask Richard Nixon if they have that capability, you know, how screwed up things are today, because even Nixon would be shaking his head over this.
[01:48:49.211 --> 01:48:57.714]  Yeah, well, if you walk into the NSA headquarters and you got a bunch of guys with their hands on Ouija boards, then something's definitely wrong with the intelligence community.
[01:48:57.714 --> 01:49:00.455]  Let's go to a caller, Frank in North Carolina.
[01:49:00.455 --> 01:49:02.416]  Frank, welcome to the show.
[01:49:02.416 --> 01:49:04.317]  You're on with Wayne Madsen.
[01:49:04.317 --> 01:49:05.497]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:49:05.497 --> 01:49:06.077]  Yes.
[01:49:06.077 --> 01:49:07.398]  Order out of chaos.
[01:49:07.398 --> 01:49:08.458]  Their order.
[01:49:08.458 --> 01:49:09.899]  Right.
[01:49:09.899 --> 01:49:12.160]  Sorry, my phone is just starting to go a little bit bad here.
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:13.240]  I'll make it quick.
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:16.601]  My source on this is one individual.
[01:49:16.601 --> 01:49:17.762]  He says he's received
[01:49:19.139 --> 01:49:25.026]  Uh, warnings from two individual insiders, one in military intelligence, I believe, and another one in law enforcement, I believe.
[01:49:25.026 --> 01:49:27.328]  David Lori Vanderbeek, he's running for governor.
[01:49:27.328 --> 01:49:32.534]  I'm not sure if you guys have talked about this yet, but he sounds pretty intelligent, you know, legitimate patriot.
[01:49:33.041 --> 01:49:46.294]  He says he's got these two guys that have warned him of a possible false flag attack on the Scout Jamboree on the grounds of the Bechtel Reservation in West Virginia beginning July 15th, possibly a bioterrorist false flag attack.
[01:49:46.294 --> 01:49:48.896]  He claims that the governor of West Virginia has already
[01:49:55.017 --> 01:49:56.897]  Well, good call Frank.
[01:49:56.897 --> 01:50:01.419]  We don't want to put words into the mouth of the governor there, but it's a legitimate question.
[01:50:01.419 --> 01:50:04.740]  What do you think, Wayne, of the possibility of upcoming false flags?
[01:50:05.248 --> 01:50:23.263]  Well, listen, after what happened at the Social Democratic Youth Camp in Norway outside of Oslo, you know, with Breivik, I wouldn't send any kids to these jamborees and these camp meetings, especially the ones that have a lot of public attention, media attention.
[01:50:23.263 --> 01:50:25.084]  I just don't think we can do it anymore.
[01:50:25.084 --> 01:50:29.888]  Not because I'm afraid of Joe Jihadi out there setting off a bomb, but
[01:50:30.608 --> 01:50:37.349]  As the caller said, there's too many anomalies with some of these attacks.
[01:50:37.349 --> 01:50:38.910]  Like Boston Marathon bombing.
[01:50:38.910 --> 01:50:40.710]  Total drill.
[01:50:40.710 --> 01:50:49.371]  I won't even get into all the other... I know there's a lot of logistics questions on the ground, but the fact is that the uncle, Uncle Ruslan, is more tied up with this guy.
[01:50:49.371 --> 01:50:50.392]  We've got to go to break, Wayne.
[01:50:50.392 --> 01:50:52.812]  Sorry to interrupt you there, but stay with us.
[01:50:52.812 --> 01:50:54.052]  We'll be right back after this break.
[01:50:54.052 --> 01:50:56.473]  More with Wayne Madsen and your call.
[01:50:56.473 --> 01:50:58.593]  Straight ahead, this is the Alex Jones Show.

[01:52:06.585 --> 01:52:12.328]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:52:12.328 --> 01:52:15.910]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:53:00.402 --> 01:53:03.884]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[01:53:03.884 --> 01:53:06.966]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[01:53:06.966 --> 01:53:09.787]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[01:53:09.787 --> 01:53:13.209]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[01:53:13.209 --> 01:53:19.473]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.

[01:53:48.425 --> 01:53:49.886]  Your peace of mind guarantee.
[01:53:49.886 --> 01:53:51.146]  efoodsdirect.com slash alex or 800-409-5633.
[01:54:04.884 --> 01:54:05.745]  We're good.
[01:54:12.423 --> 01:54:13.103]  Yeah, welcome back.
[01:54:13.103 --> 01:54:29.748]  We're interviewing NSA, former NSA insider Wayne Madsen, who is the source behind some of the documents that resulted in a Guardian story that was then yanked off the web because it made some people nervous.
[01:54:29.748 --> 01:54:35.270]  You know, in our world today, people who tell the truth are the most viciously attacked.
[01:54:36.090 --> 01:54:39.492]  If you lie to everybody, oh, you got it made.
[01:54:39.492 --> 01:54:43.175]  You can host a show on CNN.
[01:54:43.175 --> 01:54:45.096]  Your business is going to get government grants.
[01:54:45.096 --> 01:54:48.078]  If you're a big fat liar, no problem, you got it made.
[01:54:48.078 --> 01:54:51.981]  But if you tell the truth, oh no, you're going to have struggle.
[01:54:51.981 --> 01:54:52.841]  You're going to have to...
[01:54:54.042 --> 01:55:04.579]  Work your way and actually fend off criticism and attacks, and that's the situation that most of us are in, who are truth tellers, including Wayne Madsen.
[01:55:04.579 --> 01:55:06.762]  Wayne, we're going to take a couple more calls here with you, but
[01:55:08.268 --> 01:55:13.090]  On that last point, do you even pay any attention to the critics?
[01:55:13.090 --> 01:55:14.351]  Because I don't.
[01:55:14.351 --> 01:55:15.612]  I don't have time with it.
[01:55:15.612 --> 01:55:18.113]  But how do you deal with the criticism?
[01:55:18.113 --> 01:55:19.173]  I did this morning.
[01:55:19.173 --> 01:55:27.637]  I had to fire off some rebuttals to some people who defend that they're journalists and had to point out the background of these people.
[01:55:27.637 --> 01:55:30.459]  There's one guy who writes for the Daily Beast.
[01:55:30.459 --> 01:55:32.520]  Now, let's remember what the Daily Beast is.
[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:34.401]  You know, the editor is Tina Brown.
[01:55:35.361 --> 01:55:48.369]  This doyen of the British Fleet Street circuit and now more lately of the Manhattan Chardonnay swilling crowd.
[01:55:48.369 --> 01:55:53.792]  The Daily Beast bought Newsweek from the Washington Post company a couple years ago for a dollar.
[01:55:53.792 --> 01:55:55.373]  Right, I remember that.
[01:55:55.373 --> 01:55:56.393]  A dollar.
[01:55:56.393 --> 01:56:01.676]  That's what the combined media operations of the Daily Beast and Newsweek are worth.
[01:56:03.437 --> 01:56:04.618]  One dollar.
[01:56:04.618 --> 01:56:09.382]  I'd say that that's overly inflated.
[01:56:09.382 --> 01:56:11.724]  So there's a guy there named Michael Moynihan.
[01:56:11.724 --> 01:56:12.465]  Now this guy...
[01:56:15.731 --> 01:56:22.174]  He was a struggling journalist in the United States and he went where every struggling journalist goes to make a name for themselves.
[01:56:22.174 --> 01:56:24.535]  Stockholm, Sweden.
[01:56:24.535 --> 01:56:30.997]  You know, I mean, so he gets tied up with a think tank over there called Timbro that's been linked to Karl Rove.
[01:56:30.997 --> 01:56:32.538]  The wonderful Karl Rove.
[01:56:32.538 --> 01:56:34.058]  You know, this guy's a hack.
[01:56:34.058 --> 01:56:37.760]  He's a political party hack for the GOP.
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:39.281]  He's not a journalist.
[01:56:39.281 --> 01:56:40.201]  So he attacked.
[01:56:40.201 --> 01:56:42.342]  He goes on a vicious attack, suggests that
[01:56:42.902 --> 01:56:49.466]  You know, the observer never even contacted me.
[01:56:49.466 --> 01:56:52.707]  Well, let's not give him any more attention.
[01:56:52.707 --> 01:56:55.869]  The fact is, all of us who tell the truth are going to be just routinely attacked.
[01:56:55.869 --> 01:56:57.530]  It just goes with the territory.
[01:56:57.530 --> 01:56:58.810]  Let's take a call.
[01:56:58.810 --> 01:57:00.631]  Let's go to Chris in Kentucky.
[01:57:00.631 --> 01:57:02.052]  Chris, you're on the show.
[01:57:02.052 --> 01:57:03.653]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:03.653 --> 01:57:05.194]  Wayne Madsen is our guest.
[01:57:05.194 --> 01:57:05.514]  Go ahead.
[01:57:06.337 --> 01:57:07.877]  Yes, thank you very much.
[01:57:07.877 --> 01:57:09.398]  Wayne, I want to thank you first of all real quick.
[01:57:09.398 --> 01:57:11.579]  Thank you for being a patriot and standing up.
[01:57:11.579 --> 01:57:15.640]  My question is, these new phones that are coming out, is this going to be data-based?
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:17.040]  You move it with your eyes.
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:18.681]  You can move the webpage with your eyes.
[01:57:18.681 --> 01:57:21.842]  And could they take a retina scan of your eyes and database in the NSA?
[01:57:21.842 --> 01:57:23.802]  Have you had any information about that?
[01:57:23.802 --> 01:57:26.763]  Well, look, you know, let me tell you what the NSA has.
[01:57:26.763 --> 01:57:33.245]  They have a, you know, there's a group in the DOD called the DOD Advanced Research Projects Agency.
[01:57:33.245 --> 01:57:33.745]  As a matter of fact,
[01:57:34.398 --> 01:57:46.102]  What we know about Metadata and PRISM was originally a project under Homeland Security, and DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, it was called Total Information Awareness.
[01:57:46.102 --> 01:57:47.282]  Yeah, I remember that.
[01:57:47.282 --> 01:57:54.664]  It was headed up by none other than disgraced retired Admiral John Poindexter of Iran Contra Infamy.
[01:57:54.664 --> 01:57:56.205]  You know, these people never go away.
[01:57:56.205 --> 01:57:57.525]  They never go away.
[01:58:00.641 --> 01:58:03.802]  Yeah, the internet came out of DARPA.
[01:58:23.326 --> 01:58:24.046]  Oracle.
[01:58:24.046 --> 01:58:29.069]  Oracle was once the name of a CIA project on a relational database system.
[01:58:29.069 --> 01:58:30.049]  Now it's a big company.
[01:58:30.049 --> 01:58:31.110]  We're going to go to break again, Wayne.
[01:58:31.110 --> 01:58:33.111]  Will you stay with us for one more segment?
[01:58:33.111 --> 01:58:33.871]  Absolutely.
[01:58:33.871 --> 01:58:34.211]  All right.
[01:58:34.211 --> 01:58:34.912]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:58:34.912 --> 01:58:41.715]  We'll be back in just over one minute with more calls for Wayne Madsen.

[01:59:56.486 --> 01:59:59.327]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.768 --> 02:00:10.590]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.590 --> 02:00:12.191]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.191 --> 02:00:13.732]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.732 --> 02:00:17.914]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.914 --> 02:00:21.996]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.846 --> 02:00:32.631]  We've got Wayne Madsen continuing with us for the next five minutes, plus callers on the line.
[02:00:32.631 --> 02:00:36.615]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.615 --> 02:00:40.058]  You are in the right place if you're tuning in to the Alex Jones Show, so welcome.
[02:00:40.058 --> 02:00:43.060]  This is, what is this, the third hour already?
[02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:43.881]  How could it be?
[02:00:43.881 --> 02:00:45.983]  Time flies when you're being spied on.
[02:00:45.983 --> 02:00:53.149]  So Wayne, there was a caller that Alex was unable to get to, I think yesterday, that had a question for you.
[02:00:54.190 --> 02:01:00.652]  The caller was asking, can we somehow flip the surveillance technology back onto the government?
[02:01:00.652 --> 02:01:08.355]  Is there a way that the citizens can monitor the government and actually create the transparency that presidents always promise but never deliver?
[02:01:08.355 --> 02:01:09.295]  Is that possible?
[02:01:10.101 --> 02:01:14.065]  Well, I think Ed Snowden has shown it is possible.
[02:01:14.065 --> 02:01:23.374]  But unfortunately for him, he's wound up as an international pawn with Vladimir Putin today saying, you know, he can stay in Russia as long as he stops making these revelations.
[02:01:23.374 --> 02:01:27.217]  Another person over there said he's applied for asylum in 15 countries.
[02:01:27.217 --> 02:01:29.620]  He's really going to wind up like a CIA whistleblower.
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:33.283]  From some, a few decades ago, named Phil Agee.
[02:01:33.283 --> 02:01:39.448]  Phil Agee traveled on a Grenada passport, a Nicaraguan passport before he settled down with a German passport.
[02:01:39.448 --> 02:01:40.088]  Wow.
[02:01:40.088 --> 02:01:44.431]  He did eventually come back to the United States after they decided they weren't going to arrest him.
[02:01:44.431 --> 02:01:47.334]  But, you know, that's the life he's faced.
[02:01:47.334 --> 02:01:49.636]  But any whistleblowers do that.
[02:01:49.636 --> 02:01:55.861]  That's what they're they're trying to expose the government's, you know, their wrongdoings.
[02:01:55.861 --> 02:01:57.442]  But look at the price they pay.
[02:01:57.442 --> 02:01:57.722]  They've been
[02:01:57.722 --> 02:02:07.884]  What if we had an initiative where we put webcams in all the offices of all government employees so that the public can log in and see what your tax dollars are doing at that moment?
[02:02:21.311 --> 02:02:22.011]  You wouldn't see much.
[02:02:22.011 --> 02:02:29.594]  You'd see a lot of government employees sleeping or going down to fetch these styrofoam boxes full of food.
[02:02:29.594 --> 02:02:30.714]  They're like ants, you know?
[02:02:30.714 --> 02:02:38.037]  They go back and forth to the cafeterias in their federal buildings, and they're extremely obese people.
[02:02:38.037 --> 02:02:50.101]  I suggest that to one group one time, I was in an elevator at the GSA building in DC, and the elevator didn't move, and there were three rather obese persons on there, and I suggested that maybe
[02:02:51.221 --> 02:02:55.742]  They should take the freight elevator instead.
[02:02:55.742 --> 02:02:58.923]  This is what you would see in any given federal problem.
[02:02:58.923 --> 02:03:05.144]  Well, I thought I was being politically incorrect and here you go breaking a new one omen for us there, Wayne.
[02:03:05.144 --> 02:03:08.585]  I'm sorry, but that's how the government really works.
[02:03:08.585 --> 02:03:09.745]  We don't want those webcams.
[02:03:09.745 --> 02:03:11.145]  They might be too horrifying for us.
[02:03:11.145 --> 02:03:12.466]  Yeah, they would be horrifying.
[02:03:12.466 --> 02:03:13.386]  But look, today
[02:03:16.084 --> 02:03:16.524]  I don't know.
[02:03:33.806 --> 02:03:38.448]  Yeah, hello, Mike Adams and Wayne Madison.
[02:03:38.448 --> 02:03:52.955]  You know, just as an aside, I hope you people in Austin take up the case of that Justin Carter kid who is facing, I mean, lengthy sentences just for putting some just kidding posts on Facebook.
[02:03:52.955 --> 02:03:55.917]  But anyway, Mr. Madison, may I ask you this?
[02:03:55.917 --> 02:03:58.518]  A couple of quick questions.
[02:03:58.518 --> 02:04:02.940]  Do you recommend people adding all these kind of tags
[02:04:03.382 --> 02:04:04.837]  Which would, you know, which would
[02:04:05.999 --> 02:04:11.523]  Uh, catch the emails, and if 100 million people of us did it, would it jam up the system?
[02:04:11.523 --> 02:04:13.045]  Oh, the keyword tags.
[02:04:13.045 --> 02:04:14.546]  We only have 45 seconds.
[02:04:14.546 --> 02:04:15.366]  Go ahead, Wayne.
[02:04:15.366 --> 02:04:16.547]  Simple answer, no.
[02:04:16.547 --> 02:04:23.593]  They've got all kinds of algorithms that look at context and other words, so they've figured that out.
[02:04:23.593 --> 02:04:25.554]  Yeah, those keywords.
[02:04:25.554 --> 02:04:32.960]  When National Line was out, people decided to do that, and it did not affect their system whatsoever.
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:33.861]  Wayne, what's your website?
[02:04:34.521 --> 02:04:45.586]  It is WayneMadsenReport.com and anyone can go to the homepage and read about what happened with the Observer, the Guardian, and with links to the original documents that I provided them.
[02:04:45.586 --> 02:04:49.848]  Alright, WayneMadsenReport.com and Madsen is spelled M-A-D-S-E-N.
[02:04:49.848 --> 02:04:52.329]  Madsen, two syllables in that name.
[02:04:52.329 --> 02:04:55.130]  WayneMadsenReport.com, thank you Wayne for joining us on the show today.

[02:05:27.742 --> 02:05:34.926]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:05:34.926 --> 02:05:37.747]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:05:37.967 --> 02:05:44.654]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.

[02:08:05.609 --> 02:08:16.338]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:16.338 --> 02:08:18.260]  Alright, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:18.260 --> 02:08:20.362]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:08:21.917 --> 02:08:25.781]  Editor of naturalnews.com filling in for Alex today.
[02:08:25.781 --> 02:08:26.502]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:08:26.502 --> 02:08:27.382]  This is the third hour.
[02:08:27.382 --> 02:08:38.894]  You just heard from Wayne Madsen and for the rest of this hour I've got a few comments here and then I want to take your calls and then cover some of the remaining news that we haven't yet had a chance to cover.
[02:08:40.231 --> 02:08:43.714]  And I mentioned a couple of good films here, State of Mind.
[02:08:43.714 --> 02:08:48.897]  You've got to check this out at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:08:48.897 --> 02:08:56.023]  So, before I was hosting the show, one of my friends asked me, he said, Mike, are you going to talk about same-sex marriage?
[02:08:56.023 --> 02:08:59.225]  Because you haven't really gone on the record.
[02:08:59.225 --> 02:09:02.287]  What do you think about same-sex marriage?
[02:09:02.287 --> 02:09:03.588]  And you're hosting Alex's show.
[02:09:03.588 --> 02:09:06.350]  You've got to talk about that, aren't you?
[02:09:06.350 --> 02:09:07.431]  Aren't you going to talk about it?
[02:09:09.349 --> 02:09:19.053]  Well, I don't know, all this talk about same-sex marriage and opposite-sex marriage, and from what I hear, most Americans would be happy with any sex in their marriage, frankly.
[02:09:19.053 --> 02:09:21.954]  It's like, it's a no-sex marriage.
[02:09:21.954 --> 02:09:37.340]  But I'm not even really sure, I'm not sure if we can enforce all these rules one way or another, because personally, I can't tell the gender of some of these people, so I'm not, I mean, I'm not trying to be, you know, insulting or anything, I'm just saying, I can't tell.
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:53.528]  You've got some of these, um, you know, macho gay women riding around and trying to pick up dates, riding on Harleys, like, vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
[02:10:01.727 --> 02:10:08.152]  You gotta, it's almost like you gotta buy him a plane ticket on the first date so you can march him through TSA for a gender check.
[02:10:08.152 --> 02:10:09.373]  You know what I mean?
[02:10:09.373 --> 02:10:15.778]  It's like, slip a 50 to the agent and ask him, hey, what's the verdict, buddy?
[02:10:15.778 --> 02:10:18.701]  Am I dating a dude?
[02:10:18.701 --> 02:10:21.423]  Or a chick?
[02:10:21.423 --> 02:10:22.824]  I'm sorry.
[02:10:22.824 --> 02:10:23.364]  I'm sorry.
[02:10:23.364 --> 02:10:24.705]  I know it's not politically correct.
[02:10:24.705 --> 02:10:25.926]  I'm just saying.
[02:10:25.926 --> 02:10:26.507]  I'm just saying.
[02:10:26.507 --> 02:10:28.869]  Why do we have to have all this discussion about all these things?
[02:10:30.145 --> 02:10:33.887]  There's so many more important issues out there, like the fluoride in the water.
[02:10:33.887 --> 02:10:39.289]  Why do we have to be obsessed about what gender people are when they get married?
[02:10:39.289 --> 02:10:43.971]  I mean, how does the TSA even tell, by the way, if someone comes in and they're not sure?
[02:10:43.971 --> 02:10:46.432]  I mean, do they have like a gender-neutral line?
[02:10:46.432 --> 02:10:47.853]  You know, a pat-down?
[02:10:47.853 --> 02:10:51.074]  Like someone there named Pat doing the pat-down?
[02:10:51.074 --> 02:10:53.975]  Hi, I'm pat-down Pat.
[02:10:53.975 --> 02:10:55.436]  I'm going to pat you down today.
[02:10:55.436 --> 02:10:57.737]  I'm the gender-neutral TSA pat-down expert.
[02:10:58.993 --> 02:11:12.325]  I was highly trained as the head of security at Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch, and we have a very special pat-down procedure that we use there.
[02:11:12.325 --> 02:11:13.806]  Is that the way they really do it?
[02:11:13.806 --> 02:11:16.068]  Seriously?
[02:11:16.068 --> 02:11:24.055]  But, you know, back on the issue of same-sex marriage, I mean, come on, if Michael Moore marries Janet Napolitano, isn't that a same-sex marriage?
[02:11:24.055 --> 02:11:24.675]  I mean, really?
[02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:27.671]  Isn't that, doesn't that qualify?
[02:11:27.671 --> 02:11:38.821]  Because, you know, who are we to say that they can't have their fun together, their joy, frolicking in the sunset, hand in hand, bounding through fields of clover?
[02:11:38.821 --> 02:11:40.482]  You know, off into the sunset?
[02:11:40.482 --> 02:11:41.863]  It would be wonderful.
[02:11:41.863 --> 02:11:45.246]  Can you imagine those two getting married up there at the altar?
[02:11:46.047 --> 02:11:48.969]  It's like the Reverend says, I now pronounce you man and wife.
[02:11:48.969 --> 02:11:50.150]  You may kiss the bride.
[02:11:50.150 --> 02:11:55.033]  And then both of their heads turn like the exorcist.
[02:11:55.033 --> 02:11:55.713]  360 degrees.
[02:11:55.713 --> 02:11:56.754]  There is no bride.
[02:11:56.754 --> 02:11:57.614]  What?
[02:11:57.614 --> 02:11:58.675]  There's no bride.
[02:11:58.675 --> 02:12:05.159]  And then they start to kiss and there's like hormones and pheromones flying and exploding every which way.
[02:12:05.159 --> 02:12:08.041]  Like a bad scene out of the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
[02:12:08.041 --> 02:12:14.045]  A cross dressing transvestites appear on stage and start dancing in a musical number with meatloaf.
[02:12:14.705 --> 02:12:27.736]  And then George Carlin and Richard Pryor come back to life and show up on stage and their heads turn and see these two French kissing in matrimony and their heads explode out of the sheer horror of it.
[02:12:27.736 --> 02:12:29.858]  So, so yeah, I'm all for it.
[02:12:29.858 --> 02:12:32.721]  Yeah.
[02:12:32.721 --> 02:12:34.442]  At least that's how it plays out in my head.
[02:12:37.842 --> 02:12:39.603]  So, uh, go ahead.
[02:12:39.603 --> 02:12:40.343]  Go ahead and roll.
[02:12:40.343 --> 02:12:41.924]  That's a comedy bit, by the way, folks.
[02:12:41.924 --> 02:12:45.005]  That's, that's called exercising your free speech.
[02:12:45.005 --> 02:12:50.587]  That's a comedy bit aimed at some public figures that deserve to be made fun of.
[02:12:50.587 --> 02:12:51.888]  Just, just a little bit.
[02:12:51.888 --> 02:12:52.908]  Just a little bit.
[02:12:52.908 --> 02:12:55.209]  So, uh, let's go to some calls.
[02:12:55.209 --> 02:12:56.470]  Get a little more serious here.
[02:12:56.470 --> 02:13:00.952]  You gotta have fun from time to time because it's, it's too insane to take seriously all the time.
[02:13:00.952 --> 02:13:02.773]  Let's go to Phil in Florida.
[02:13:02.773 --> 02:13:04.213]  Phil, you're on the show.
[02:13:04.213 --> 02:13:05.494]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:13:06.468 --> 02:13:07.288]  Hey, Mr. Adams.
[02:13:07.288 --> 02:13:08.388]  Thanks for everything.
[02:13:08.388 --> 02:13:09.489]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:13:09.489 --> 02:13:10.949]  You betcha.
[02:13:10.949 --> 02:13:13.529]  Yeah, I just had a question.
[02:13:13.529 --> 02:13:26.972]  I mean, I was surprised when everybody was surprised about this NA stuff, mostly because Alex and yourself have opened my eyes to exactly how corrupt and gigantic our government has become.
[02:13:26.972 --> 02:13:27.752]  And I don't know.
[02:13:27.752 --> 02:13:35.634]  I mean, I'm not saying that the Snowden story is a distractor, but I don't know whatever happened to this check and dude the FBI executed over here in Orlando.
[02:13:35.634 --> 02:13:36.054]  Which guy?
[02:13:37.782 --> 02:13:42.646]  The Chechen guy that they were interviewing that supposedly knew the bombers in Boston.
[02:13:42.646 --> 02:13:43.166]  Right.
[02:13:43.166 --> 02:13:44.828]  Yeah, I haven't heard anything on that.
[02:13:44.828 --> 02:13:47.830]  And the last thing I heard, the FBI was investigating it.
[02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:48.971]  That was a month ago.
[02:13:48.971 --> 02:13:58.079]  Well, this is the problem that the scandals are coming so fast and furious, pun intended, that you don't even have time to dig into one before another one crops up.
[02:13:58.619 --> 02:14:04.444]  And they know that the attention span of the people is so short that they will just jump from one scandal to the next.
[02:14:04.444 --> 02:14:09.809]  And then when you want to go back to one that you haven't fully uncovered, they'll say, oh, that's old news is no longer relevant.
[02:14:09.809 --> 02:14:12.391]  So that's I think that's what's happening.
[02:14:12.391 --> 02:14:15.594]  I mean, if you know who knows what that guy had.
[02:14:15.594 --> 02:14:16.274]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:14:16.274 --> 02:14:19.137]  Supposedly he knew this kid and now he's dead.
[02:14:19.137 --> 02:14:20.038]  No one can ask him.
[02:14:20.038 --> 02:14:21.599]  So well, that's what I want to ask.
[02:14:21.599 --> 02:14:23.881]  Mr. Matt, thanks for having me on.
[02:14:23.881 --> 02:14:25.943]  And hopefully someone will look into it a little more.
[02:14:26.380 --> 02:14:27.021]  You bet, Phil.
[02:14:27.021 --> 02:14:28.082]  Thanks for your call.
[02:14:28.082 --> 02:14:31.886]  I mean, we do know that the death squads are operating in America.
[02:14:31.886 --> 02:14:35.770]  Some rogue element of the government is running around killing people.
[02:14:35.770 --> 02:14:37.352]  We know that's true.
[02:14:37.352 --> 02:14:39.875]  And, just for the record, I want to be on the record like Alex said.
[02:14:41.957 --> 02:14:43.558]  I'm not suicidal.
[02:14:43.558 --> 02:14:45.538]  I don't drive fast cars down the highway.
[02:14:45.538 --> 02:14:47.439]  I don't drink alcohol.
[02:14:47.439 --> 02:14:49.700]  I don't visit prostitutes.
[02:14:49.700 --> 02:14:51.760]  I don't use recreational drugs.
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:53.501]  I'm not into any of that stuff.
[02:14:53.501 --> 02:14:56.542]  So if they try to set me up with that stuff, you know it's staged.
[02:14:57.262 --> 02:15:04.465]  I mean, if I die in a farm equipment accident, that might be real.
[02:15:04.465 --> 02:15:08.127]  It's like a John Deere ran over him or something, you know?
[02:15:08.127 --> 02:15:12.109]  That could be real, because I'm actually out there on the farm, but I try to be safe.
[02:15:12.109 --> 02:15:16.191]  So let's go to a white grand wizard in Florida.
[02:15:16.191 --> 02:15:19.092]  Mr. Wizard, welcome to the show!
[02:15:19.092 --> 02:15:20.573]  Yes, hello, Mr. Adams.
[02:15:21.764 --> 02:15:38.372]  I'd like to ask Alex the Dental Warrior's team if they're going to do a documentary or a movie on the trains, the guillotine trains that are all around America, where they are, who built them.
[02:15:39.116 --> 02:15:42.618]  Um, when they're supposed to be used, et cetera, at that point.
[02:15:42.618 --> 02:15:44.719]  Well, I will certainly pass on that comment.
[02:15:44.719 --> 02:15:47.961]  The thing is, I keep hearing about these trains full of guillotines.
[02:15:47.961 --> 02:15:52.004]  I, I gotta profess, I've never seen any photos of this.
[02:15:52.004 --> 02:15:53.665]  I don't know that that's real.
[02:15:53.665 --> 02:15:57.087]  I, people keep telling me, I don't, I just don't know.
[02:15:57.087 --> 02:15:59.268]  Why would they use guillotines in the first place?
[02:15:59.268 --> 02:16:05.792]  It sounds like a lot of trouble to go through when you could just unleash a biological weapon and just do it much more quickly.
[02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:11.496]  Well, that's a good question in itself, but I've seen photos of those trains.
[02:16:11.496 --> 02:16:16.845]  They're three stacked high, you know, three levels high, and they each have a guillotine.
[02:16:17.509 --> 02:16:21.091]  You know, you ride around, you kill people, and then you dump them off in a mass grave.
[02:16:21.091 --> 02:16:22.131]  That's my assumption.
[02:16:22.131 --> 02:16:25.812]  Well, I mean, it's just way more efficient ways to kill people.
[02:16:25.812 --> 02:16:27.913]  You know, bullets, for example.
[02:16:27.913 --> 02:16:30.094]  I mean, the DHS has bought all that ammunition.
[02:16:30.094 --> 02:16:32.455]  That's probably a much faster way, I think.
[02:16:32.455 --> 02:16:38.638]  Probably, I'm just guessing, I'm just putting this out there, that maybe these are some kind of mechanical parts.
[02:16:39.318 --> 02:16:42.460]  that look like guillotines but maybe they're not guillotines.
[02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:43.161]  I'm just saying.
[02:16:43.161 --> 02:16:44.201]  That's just conjecture.
[02:16:44.201 --> 02:16:46.663]  I don't, I profess, I don't know the situation.
[02:16:46.663 --> 02:16:47.463]  We'll look into it.
[02:16:47.463 --> 02:16:50.866]  But thanks for your call, Mr. Wizard.
[02:16:50.866 --> 02:16:52.647]  We'll look into the guillotine situation.
[02:16:52.647 --> 02:16:53.948]  I don't know, man.
[02:16:53.948 --> 02:16:55.749]  I guess nothing would surprise me at this point.
[02:16:55.749 --> 02:16:59.111]  Let's go to Dylan in Minnesota, I believe.
[02:16:59.111 --> 02:16:59.731]  Welcome, Dylan.
[02:16:59.731 --> 02:17:02.934]  Hi, Mike.
[02:17:02.934 --> 02:17:06.136]  Yeah, I was really hoping to get through to Wayne Morrison, but
[02:17:07.116 --> 02:17:10.778]  But I suppose I'll address my question to you.
[02:17:10.778 --> 02:17:15.360]  I was curious if there was any new information on Philip Marshall.
[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:32.067]  He was a 9-11 researcher and apparently he used to fly in cocaine for the CIA, which he admitted in the 80s, and he was found dead in his home with his two children who were also deceased.
[02:17:33.703 --> 02:17:36.825]  Well, I'm not aware of any additional information on that individual.
[02:17:36.825 --> 02:17:39.306]  In fact, that's the first time I've heard his name.
[02:17:39.306 --> 02:17:46.191]  I haven't... I'm sorry, I'm not a specialist on, you know, the CIA drug-running situation.
[02:17:46.191 --> 02:17:51.674]  But now that you put it out there here on the show, maybe others will bring some information forth on that.
[02:17:51.674 --> 02:17:53.415]  I appreciate your question.
[02:17:53.415 --> 02:17:57.298]  There's a lot of leads that need to be followed up here, because I think all the evidence is out there.
[02:17:57.958 --> 02:18:06.044]  We just, we don't have the manpower here at InfoWars to run like full-on investigations into every single thing that needs to be investigated.
[02:18:06.044 --> 02:18:09.287]  We're just, we're doing the best we can, but thank you for your tip.
[02:18:09.287 --> 02:18:11.629]  Maybe that'll spur some information to be brought forth.
[02:18:11.629 --> 02:18:14.251]  Let's go to another caller, Bobby in Texas.
[02:18:14.251 --> 02:18:14.911]  Thank you, Bobby.
[02:18:14.911 --> 02:18:15.712]  Welcome to the show.
[02:18:16.857 --> 02:18:30.048]  From proudly a male warrior sentient world revolutionary number nine fighting the quantum world simulators and all those confused at best truly evil most likely lockstep sociopaths waiting war on all of us especially babies.
[02:18:30.048 --> 02:18:33.250]  That is quite quite a number there Reefer Seed.
[02:18:33.250 --> 02:18:35.332]  Is this Reefer Seed?
[02:18:35.332 --> 02:18:37.574]  By golly you picked me up one more time.
[02:18:37.574 --> 02:18:40.876]  Well you have a very particular voice but nice intro there.
[02:18:40.876 --> 02:18:41.657]  What's on your mind buddy?
[02:18:42.523 --> 02:18:47.826]  Well, just briefly, why not let gays just use another name than marriage, like civil unions?
[02:18:47.826 --> 02:18:52.249]  But more importantly, I wanted to thank you, Sir Mike Adams, for everything you do for all of us.
[02:18:52.249 --> 02:18:55.551]  And by the way, today's doubling of student loan interest rates.
[02:19:01.591 --> 02:19:04.451]  Well, there is a plan underway.
[02:19:04.451 --> 02:19:09.353]  I mean, it's not only the student loan rates, it's also the health insurance rates doubling for single women in California.
[02:19:09.353 --> 02:19:11.013]  I don't know if you heard that earlier.
[02:19:11.013 --> 02:19:12.914]  The Obamacare exchanges are about to kick in.
[02:19:12.914 --> 02:19:15.715]  Rates are going to go up for everybody.
[02:19:15.715 --> 02:19:19.636]  They're trying to destroy everybody, including, as you've experienced, free speech.
[02:19:19.636 --> 02:19:24.057]  Are they letting you go into the Capitol building anymore and protest these days?
[02:19:25.145 --> 02:19:28.149]  I'm not allowed to speak at the Travis County Commissioner's Court sessions.
[02:19:28.149 --> 02:19:31.213]  I can speak at City Hall but only once in every four meetings.
[02:19:31.213 --> 02:19:41.867]  But anyway, I plan to buy at least, by the way, two Bokashi food waste recyclers so as to have both organic and non-organic soil to work with.
[02:19:44.465 --> 02:19:47.829]  Well, we've got to go to a break, but nice to hear from you again.
[02:19:47.829 --> 02:19:49.530]  Thanks for your call and your questions.
[02:19:49.530 --> 02:19:52.493]  And after this, we're going to go to more calls.
[02:19:52.493 --> 02:19:55.456]  So call in, and we're going to go to George, Eric, Mike, and others.

[02:21:01.061 --> 02:21:09.403]  Hi, my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered severe hot flashes which prevented me from sleeping all night.
[02:21:09.403 --> 02:21:13.924]  It was so hard to work because I continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell.
[02:21:13.924 --> 02:21:16.344]  I was exhausted and depleted.
[02:21:16.344 --> 02:21:21.245]  After only three weeks on One World Way, I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally again.
[02:21:21.245 --> 02:21:23.466]  I feel energized and strong.
[02:21:23.966 --> 02:21:25.247]  This is an amazing product.
[02:21:43.456 --> 02:21:43.716]  I think so.
[02:22:00.956 --> 02:22:07.442]  Quantitative Easing, Unemployment at Depression Levels, Europe Financial System Falling Apart, China Getting Out of U.S.
[02:22:07.442 --> 02:22:08.223]  Treasuries.
[02:22:08.223 --> 02:22:15.589]  At the end of 2008, the time of TARP, the national debt was at $11 trillion, gold trading around $850 per ounce.
[02:22:15.589 --> 02:22:22.395]  Close to 2012, the national debt exceeded $16.4 trillion, gold doubled to $1,600 per ounce.
[02:22:22.395 --> 02:22:25.238]  The $20 trillion threshold for the national debt is inevitable.
[02:22:25.478 --> 02:22:29.601]  Politicians in Washington have a ferocious appetite for spending and stimulus.
[02:22:29.601 --> 02:22:32.282]  What's worse, a printing press to finance.
[02:22:32.282 --> 02:22:38.066]  A hundred years ago, we had a gold standard to limit this madness, but now you have to adopt your own gold standard.
[02:22:38.066 --> 02:22:39.867]  Don't be fooled with paper promises.

[02:22:57.440 --> 02:23:05.246]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:23:05.246 --> 02:23:07.348]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:23:08.258 --> 02:23:17.223]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:23:17.223 --> 02:23:22.126]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[02:24:10.309 --> 02:24:12.210]  Alright, we're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:12.210 --> 02:24:14.112]  Thank you for staying with us.
[02:24:14.112 --> 02:24:15.934]  I hope you've enjoyed the show so far.
[02:24:15.934 --> 02:24:21.358]  We appreciate your support here at InfoWars, and I appreciate your support in particular.
[02:24:21.358 --> 02:24:31.087]  I am a guest volunteer host, so I guess I'm only here because the listeners like me to come back, and so Alex invites me back.
[02:24:32.426 --> 02:24:36.710]  You know, as long as he keeps doing that, I'll keep coming back and I'll give you my take on things.
[02:24:36.710 --> 02:24:39.592]  And, you know, I'm not going to be politically correct.
[02:24:39.592 --> 02:24:40.593]  I'm not going to be censored.
[02:24:40.593 --> 02:24:43.436]  I'm going to lay out the issues as I see them.
[02:24:43.436 --> 02:24:50.742]  And I'm not going to be intimidated by critics out there that want me to shut up and not talk about the issues that really matter.
[02:24:50.742 --> 02:24:52.523]  So, you know, there you go.
[02:24:52.523 --> 02:24:53.284]  I have no boss.
[02:24:53.284 --> 02:24:54.065]  I can't be fired.
[02:24:54.065 --> 02:24:55.286]  I'm not on the payroll.
[02:24:55.286 --> 02:24:56.246]  So there you go.
[02:24:56.246 --> 02:24:58.108]  That's why I'm telling the truth.
[02:24:58.108 --> 02:24:59.870]  Now, speaking of the truth,
[02:25:00.973 --> 02:25:10.740]  This is a discussion that I had planned for today, and then we'll go to your calls after this, after the next break, but this is a discussion I call the rise of the machines and why the future doesn't need you.
[02:25:10.740 --> 02:25:14.303]  I want to elaborate on what Alex said last week.
[02:25:14.303 --> 02:25:15.424]  Now, here's the thing.
[02:25:15.424 --> 02:25:22.649]  The technology is becoming viable now to have, in the next couple of decades, humanoid-shaped robots.
[02:25:22.649 --> 02:25:24.211]  They'll probably be about five foot nine.
[02:25:24.211 --> 02:25:28.013]  They want to make them a little bit shorter than a typical, you know, American male.
[02:25:29.113 --> 02:25:29.273]  to be
[02:25:47.481 --> 02:25:49.944]  The first application of this is of course going to be in the military.
[02:25:49.944 --> 02:25:52.367]  They will be soldiers on the field.
[02:25:52.367 --> 02:26:03.181]  They will be commanded by a human soldier that's the key decision maker, but the actual grunts that are carrying the rifles and doing the real hard frontline battle work, like defusing IEDs,
[02:26:04.195 --> 02:26:15.380]  That's going to be done by robotic soldiers, and we're showing on screen, by the way, an actual walking robotic soldier that's being developed by Boston Dynamics, for those of you watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:26:15.380 --> 02:26:17.902]  So it is becoming a reality very quickly.
[02:26:17.902 --> 02:26:32.468]  And these look creepy, spooky, real-life robots, humanoid robots, but as they become less expensive and they go into mass production, then the corporations are going to start buying them to replace workers.
[02:26:32.468 --> 02:26:33.109]  Why is that?
[02:26:34.420 --> 02:26:35.301]  Main reason?
[02:26:35.301 --> 02:26:36.262]  Unions.
[02:26:36.262 --> 02:26:46.670]  You see, corporations don't want to deal with unions, and if they hire robots to replace people, then they don't have to negotiate with the union for the robot.
[02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:52.715]  I know a lot of you out there listening are in unions, and you may be thinking, holy cow, that's crazy, but it's true.
[02:26:53.772 --> 02:26:58.354]  Your corporation would rather not have a human do the job if they could have a robot do the job.
[02:26:58.354 --> 02:27:15.401]  So what's going to happen is we're going to have robots creeping into the low-level labor supply, displacing the low-level labor workers, which includes, by the way, most of the current so-called illegal immigrants, undocumented workers, who might be granted amnesty if the amnesty bill becomes law.
[02:27:16.041 --> 02:27:20.244]  They're going to be doing a lot of agricultural work, harvesting crops and so on.
[02:27:20.244 --> 02:27:25.048]  They will be one of the first to be replaced by labor robots.
[02:27:25.048 --> 02:27:32.794]  So you're going to have millions and millions of displaced workers who used to be undocumented immigrants, now have blue card status in the U.S.
[02:27:32.794 --> 02:27:34.435]  potentially, and now they're out of work.
[02:27:35.797 --> 02:27:44.785]  And by the way, everybody that's working in fast food, if you're a fast food cashier, your job is going to be replaced by a robot in the next couple of decades.
[02:27:44.785 --> 02:27:46.166]  You're going to become obsolete.
[02:27:46.166 --> 02:27:53.133]  This is going to happen higher and higher in the workforce as robots become more complex and more capable.
[02:27:53.133 --> 02:28:01.660]  What it means is that probably eventually up to 70, 80, maybe even 90% of the workforce is going to become obsolete.
[02:28:02.501 --> 02:28:03.301]  You get that?
[02:28:03.301 --> 02:28:07.983]  Obsolete in the minds of the globalists that run the system.
[02:28:07.983 --> 02:28:22.287]  So, in their minds, they're thinking, okay, we've got robots taking over the jobs, all these billions of people are displaced out of the workforce, they've got no jobs, they've got no way to make a living, they've got no skills that we need now because the robots can do the work for them.
[02:28:22.287 --> 02:28:23.687]  What are you going to do if you're a globalist?
[02:28:24.935 --> 02:28:27.459]  Holocaust 2.0 is what you're going to do.
[02:28:27.459 --> 02:28:36.854]  You're going to soft kill masses of people, or you're going to put in infertility technologies to make sure that nobody can reproduce, thereby reducing the human population.
[02:28:37.992 --> 02:28:42.594]  Leaving only the top 10% that have skills that robots can't replace.
[02:28:42.594 --> 02:28:48.777]  Those are skills like engineering skills, entrepreneurial skills, business, finance skills, artist skills, you know?
[02:28:48.777 --> 02:28:56.240]  A robot can't be an artist because it doesn't have the spirit, the free will consciousness of creation in it, like an artist can create a work of art.
[02:28:56.240 --> 02:28:58.681]  You're always going to have value in society.
[02:28:58.681 --> 02:29:06.064]  But if you're a low-end laborer out there, eventually you or your children or your grandchildren are going to become obsolete and replaced by the robots.
[02:29:07.847 --> 02:29:11.950]  The solution to this, you can't stop the robots.
[02:29:11.950 --> 02:29:13.151]  They're coming.
[02:29:13.151 --> 02:29:14.713]  The technology is moving forward.
[02:29:14.713 --> 02:29:15.854]  DARPA is doing the investments.
[02:29:15.854 --> 02:29:16.774]  They want the soldiers.
[02:29:16.774 --> 02:29:18.255]  The corporations want the workers.
[02:29:18.255 --> 02:29:19.777]  You can't stop that.
[02:29:19.777 --> 02:29:23.560]  What you can do out there is upgrade your value.
[02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:25.501]  Invest in your own education.
[02:29:25.501 --> 02:29:26.682]  Improve your skills.
[02:29:27.723 --> 02:29:37.691]  Be somebody, I mean, be somebody that has a skill that a robot can't replace and teach your children to be that way and your grandchildren to be that way.
[02:29:37.691 --> 02:29:46.998]  They can be safe in a society even if there is a Holocaust 2.0 that tries to get rid of the lower class of workers that the globalists are trying to kill.
[02:29:46.998 --> 02:29:48.820]  That's the Rise of the Machines segment.
[02:29:48.820 --> 02:29:50.561]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:29:50.561 --> 02:29:53.463]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.487 --> 02:29:57.157]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:05.476 --> 02:30:06.738]  Tyranny is here.
[02:30:06.738 --> 02:30:10.682]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:30:10.682 --> 02:30:12.904]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:30:12.904 --> 02:30:18.790]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:25.016]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:30:25.436 --> 02:30:31.420]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:30:31.420 --> 02:30:35.603]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:30:35.603 --> 02:30:39.885]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:30:39.885 --> 02:30:45.829]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:30:45.829 --> 02:30:49.391]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:30:49.391 --> 02:30:51.372]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:30:51.372 --> 02:30:51.793]  It's here.

[02:31:01.417 --> 02:31:04.919]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[02:31:04.919 --> 02:31:07.560]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[02:31:07.560 --> 02:31:10.802]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[02:31:10.802 --> 02:31:14.243]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[02:31:14.243 --> 02:31:20.486]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.
[02:31:20.766 --> 02:31:22.827]  Wonder if there'll really be a problem?
[02:31:22.827 --> 02:31:30.272]  eFoods Direct has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you'll be glad you ordered food until July 10th.

[02:32:01.028 --> 02:32:04.889]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[02:32:04.889 --> 02:32:10.411]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[02:32:10.411 --> 02:32:18.133]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:32:18.133 --> 02:32:27.235]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:32:27.455 --> 02:32:34.604]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:32:34.604 --> 02:32:37.508]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:32:37.508 --> 02:32:43.435]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[02:32:44.156 --> 02:32:47.637]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:16.431 --> 02:33:23.218]  Continuing here on the Alex Jones Show, we're going to break down some more news and take your calls.
[02:33:23.218 --> 02:33:26.541]  Virginia college student arrested after buying bottled water.
[02:33:26.541 --> 02:33:31.446]  Oh my, the undercover officer.
[02:33:32.759 --> 02:33:41.464]  Thought she had alcohol in her possession when she had actually just left some kind of convenience store buying bottled water.
[02:33:41.464 --> 02:33:46.707]  So she was arrested because I guess there's not enough real crimes going on.
[02:33:46.707 --> 02:33:55.152]  So, you know, the FBI, the ATF, the alcohol enforcement people have to run around, you know, making up victims, making up their own crimes so they can arrest somebody.
[02:33:55.152 --> 02:33:59.215]  I mean, aren't there real crimes going on that you could investigate?
[02:34:00.154 --> 02:34:05.757]  I mean, why isn't the FBI out there investigating all the corporate corruption in the pharmaceutical industry?
[02:34:05.757 --> 02:34:11.000]  If you want to find criminals, just go to the top of that little cabal right there.
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:14.582]  Apple applies for the iWatch trademark.
[02:34:16.019 --> 02:34:23.946]  Yes, a lot of people think that means that they're going to have a wearable watch technology that will, of course, watch you.
[02:34:23.946 --> 02:34:32.734]  So, if you actually want to wear an extension of the NSA on your wrist, it'll probably monitor, you know, your heartbeat.
[02:34:33.434 --> 02:34:42.700]  So that when you're being interrogated by the TSA at airport security, they can determine if you have an elevated heart rate or something like that.
[02:34:42.700 --> 02:34:56.008]  I bet it will monitor your heart rate and report it back to Apple because there's nothing, there's nothing that they won't do now to violate your privacy.
[02:34:56.008 --> 02:35:02.171]  Another news item here, the Monsanto-funded World Food Prize has been granted to...
[02:35:03.292 --> 02:35:05.633]  Well, Monsanto.
[02:35:05.633 --> 02:35:25.920]  Yes, Monsanto funded an organization that gave itself an award, the World Food Prize Award, which is granted to somebody that apparently helps advance human development by spreading genetic pollution all around the world, and so they came up with their own prize and financed it and they gave it to themselves.
[02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:27.741]  This would be like, like,
[02:35:29.059 --> 02:35:33.340]  I don't know, InfoWars coming up with the InfoWars award and then awarding it to Alex Jones.
[02:35:33.340 --> 02:35:37.902]  I mean, it's so self-serving for Monsanto to do this.
[02:35:37.902 --> 02:35:40.023]  It's a complete joke.
[02:35:40.023 --> 02:35:49.426]  You notice, by the way, at the highest levels of government and corruption, they're always giving each other awards and academic degrees and knighthoods and all these things.
[02:35:50.866 --> 02:35:58.934]  Oh yeah, on the day that they're bombing some innocent civilians somewhere, they'll give them, you know, the Peace Prize.
[02:35:58.934 --> 02:36:01.156]  The Obama Peace Prize.
[02:36:01.156 --> 02:36:04.259]  Because his bombs are love bombs.
[02:36:04.259 --> 02:36:06.120]  They don't blow up, they blow in.
[02:36:07.642 --> 02:36:10.804]  Alright, let's go to a video, then we'll go to your calls after this.
[02:36:10.804 --> 02:36:16.326]  Saddam was a key in an early CIA plot, it turns out.
[02:36:16.326 --> 02:36:20.608]  This is news that is suddenly resurging in interest.
[02:36:20.608 --> 02:36:23.790]  Let's run this video clip about Saddam Hussein.
[02:36:23.790 --> 02:36:28.192]  So we decided that Saddam Hussein ought to accept something very similar.
[02:36:29.406 --> 02:36:34.088]  Now probably a lot of you know that Saddam has been our boy for a very, very long time.
[02:36:34.088 --> 02:36:34.928]  As John Perkins told you.
[02:36:34.928 --> 02:36:41.710]  And you may remember Abdul Karim Qasim, who was president of Iraq in the early 60s.
[02:36:41.710 --> 02:36:45.132]  Qasim came up with a unique concept.
[02:36:45.132 --> 02:36:53.374]  He said, Iraqi oil ought to go to benefit the Iraqi people.
[02:36:53.374 --> 02:36:54.475]  How novel is that?
[02:37:00.299 --> 02:37:03.661]  Well, we didn't like that very much.
[02:37:03.661 --> 02:37:11.365]  He began to tax the oil companies, particularly the British and some American companies, and threatened to nationalize our oil companies.
[02:37:11.365 --> 02:37:13.646]  And so we decided that Qasim had to go.
[02:37:13.646 --> 02:37:18.148]  We, the CIA, sent an assassination team.
[02:37:18.148 --> 02:37:24.312]  It was headed by a man who was still going through high school, an Iraqi citizen who was still going through high school.
[02:37:27.301 --> 02:37:33.645]  They riddled Qasim's car with bullets on the streets of Baghdad and missed him.
[02:37:33.645 --> 02:37:38.228]  The head of this assassination team was wounded and fled to Syria.
[02:37:38.228 --> 02:37:40.689]  His name was Saddam Hussein.
[02:37:40.689 --> 02:37:44.712]  He was a CIA agent in those days, an assassin for us.
[02:37:44.712 --> 02:37:45.372]  He failed.
[02:37:45.372 --> 02:37:46.213]  He was our boy.
[02:37:46.213 --> 02:37:47.434]  He was our man.
[02:37:48.394 --> 02:37:53.656]  And so, and we sold him a lot of, and gave him a lot of tanks.
[02:37:53.656 --> 02:38:02.659]  We built him, Bechtel built him big chemical, I don't know, my father-in-law was chief architect at Bechtel, built, sat on big chemical plants.
[02:38:03.359 --> 02:38:12.584]  They were used and we knew that they were used to make mustard gas and other chemical weapons that were being employed against the Kurds and later the Iranians.
[02:38:12.584 --> 02:38:15.365]  We knew this, but we sold them these things.
[02:38:15.365 --> 02:38:22.889]  You have to remember that Middle Eastern oil is the oil that's used by a great deal of Europe and China and Japan.
[02:38:22.889 --> 02:38:26.571]  If we control Middle Eastern oil, we control our biggest
[02:38:27.932 --> 02:38:33.795]  All right, that's John Perkins, author of Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[02:38:33.795 --> 02:38:36.777]  We've got to have John back on this show, by the way.
[02:38:36.777 --> 02:38:41.180]  He's got a lot of good information.
[02:38:41.180 --> 02:38:42.241]  He knows how these things work.
[02:38:42.241 --> 02:38:43.802]  Basically, the U.S.
[02:38:43.802 --> 02:38:53.568]  government obviously recruits people like Saddam Hussein to do its bidding to hijack and overthrow foreign nations and get them into debt with the World Bank so that the U.S.
[02:38:53.568 --> 02:38:55.229]  then has leverage
[02:38:55.729 --> 02:38:56.009]  Yeah, so...
[02:39:18.234 --> 02:39:20.675]  A lot of competition going on there between the U.S.
[02:39:20.675 --> 02:39:23.175]  and China to get the natural resources of the world.
[02:39:23.175 --> 02:39:23.876]  I mean, what else?
[02:39:23.876 --> 02:39:25.136]  What else is it really all about?
[02:39:25.136 --> 02:39:26.116]  Power.
[02:39:26.116 --> 02:39:28.837]  Power and domination.
[02:39:28.837 --> 02:39:33.538]  Let me bring you this piece of news very quickly, then we'll go to a call.
[02:39:33.538 --> 02:39:41.701]  Jennifer Lopez has been forced to apologize for singing happy birthday to a brutal Turkmen dictator accused of torture.
[02:39:42.521 --> 02:39:53.955]  She was singing happy birthday to him at a celebration concert and she has now apologized for singing the song to the most repressive, one of the most repressive regimes in the world according to Human Rights Watch.
[02:39:53.955 --> 02:40:00.863]  And in related news, Lady Gaga has changed the national anthem to end with the line, and the home of the gay.
[02:40:03.726 --> 02:40:10.291]  She thinks she's living in a country that is like 90% gay or something.
[02:40:10.291 --> 02:40:13.954]  Maybe her supporters are, but certainly not the rest of the country.
[02:40:13.954 --> 02:40:16.957]  I mean again, stop shoving in our face, okay Lady Gaga?
[02:40:17.577 --> 02:40:23.139]  You're a warped individual at every level.
[02:40:23.139 --> 02:40:25.600]  That's right.
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:26.560]  I didn't say it.
[02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:27.040]  They said.
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:28.261]  This is on CNN.
[02:40:28.261 --> 02:40:34.483]  They don't want overweight airline flight attendants because they take too much fuel to fly back and forth.
[02:40:34.483 --> 02:40:37.224]  So they're hiring ultra thin women
[02:40:37.904 --> 02:40:42.267]  Who also, by the way, happened to fit through the aisles better in an emergency.
[02:40:42.267 --> 02:40:43.268]  That's no joke.
[02:40:43.268 --> 02:40:50.092]  I mean, in an emergency situation, you gotta be able to get your bod out of the aisle, out of the plane, and help other passengers escape.
[02:40:50.092 --> 02:40:53.234]  So there's actually a physical reason behind that as well.
[02:40:53.234 --> 02:41:01.259]  I know it's politically incorrect to talk about women being thin, you know, but hey, that's what this airline is doing, so we're reporting the news.
[02:41:01.259 --> 02:41:03.441]  Let's go to George in Connecticut.
[02:41:03.441 --> 02:41:05.442]  George, thank you for holding and welcome to the show.
[02:41:06.260 --> 02:41:10.946]  Hi Mike, I have a comment and also a question, a quick comment.
[02:41:10.946 --> 02:41:18.455]  I know you did a documentary with Gary Noll on the genetically engineered seeds.
[02:41:19.145 --> 02:41:23.968]  He has a great idea that he started up with his radio show.
[02:41:23.968 --> 02:41:34.515]  He basically, you can dial in and listen to the show while you're, you know, you dial into that number and it'll automatically, you don't need any special app or anything like that.
[02:41:34.515 --> 02:41:37.397]  I think Alex should do something like that.
[02:41:37.397 --> 02:41:48.605]  What we should do is have hundreds of people meet up at government buildings and like the walls of Jericho, they turn on the show and then have an amplifier and take
[02:41:49.025 --> 02:41:49.288]  Yeah.
[02:41:51.206 --> 02:41:52.106]  That's pretty cool.
[02:41:52.106 --> 02:42:00.791]  Yeah, well, Gary Knoll's great and I really like his work in nutrition and truth-telling on issues like vaccines as well.
[02:42:00.791 --> 02:42:05.373]  I believe he's on the Progressive Radio Network, PRN.
[02:42:05.373 --> 02:42:11.736]  I think that Alex's audience is so large that if there was a call-in number it would be overwhelmed.
[02:42:11.736 --> 02:42:19.379]  They'd have to have like an NSA-style data system here just to handle all those phone calls, but it's an interesting idea for sure.
[02:42:19.379 --> 02:42:20.300]  Do you have another question?
[02:42:21.173 --> 02:42:25.776]  I have a question on something that Alex was talking about on Friday.
[02:42:25.776 --> 02:42:31.359]  Maybe you can help me fill it in, or if you can't, maybe you can talk to Alex and he can get more details on it.
[02:42:31.359 --> 02:42:43.506]  That idea that he was talking about that they basically have in the Obamacare that basically gives them up to a 12-year amnesty on any illegals working, so they don't have to work less than 30 hours to
[02:42:44.666 --> 02:42:44.886]  I know.
[02:43:11.761 --> 02:43:13.242]  Well, good question, George.
[02:43:13.242 --> 02:43:14.722]  I'll run that by Alex.
[02:43:14.722 --> 02:43:17.503]  He might even be hearing your comment right now.
[02:43:17.503 --> 02:43:20.624]  Look, the thing is, almost nobody knows what's in this bill.
[02:43:20.624 --> 02:43:21.305]  That's the thing.
[02:43:21.305 --> 02:43:23.065]  It's just like Obamacare.
[02:43:23.065 --> 02:43:26.927]  Pelosi's saying, let's pass it so we can find out what's in it.
[02:43:26.927 --> 02:43:36.630]  It's so massive and it's so full of pork and deception, and you have to navigate it like a minefield, a linguistic minefield, just to figure out what's in it.
[02:43:36.630 --> 02:43:38.271]  But you can bet it's bad for America.
[02:43:38.971 --> 02:43:54.083]  So, it is true that the amnesty bill is going to try to give corporations preferential benefits if they hire these newly documented, formerly illegal, undocumented immigrants over Americans.
[02:43:54.083 --> 02:43:58.206]  That's absolutely true because this bill is designed to destroy America.
[02:43:58.206 --> 02:44:02.890]  It's not a human rights bill, it is an economic destruction bill for America.
[02:44:02.930 --> 02:44:07.316]  Yeah, and any Republicans, by the way, that get behind it are just committing political suicide.
[02:44:07.316 --> 02:44:11.002]  So it needs to be fixed in a huge way.
[02:44:11.002 --> 02:44:12.784]  Let's go to Mike in Denver.
[02:44:12.784 --> 02:44:13.746]  Mike, thank you for your call.
[02:44:13.746 --> 02:44:14.206]  You're on the air.
[02:44:14.206 --> 02:44:14.467]  Go ahead.
[02:44:15.086 --> 02:44:16.348]  Hey Mike, how's it going today?
[02:44:16.348 --> 02:44:17.529]  It's going pretty good.
[02:44:17.529 --> 02:44:18.730]  Are you enjoying the show?
[02:44:18.730 --> 02:44:26.300]  You know, you're coming along so great, I was going to tell you that from the very first time I heard you guest host until today, you're just spectacular.
[02:44:26.300 --> 02:44:29.523]  Give up the good work!
[02:44:29.523 --> 02:44:31.626]  We're doing our best, that's all.
[02:44:31.626 --> 02:44:33.068]  What's your question or comment?
[02:44:33.533 --> 02:44:41.918]  You know, comment out here in Denver, I don't think many of us are going to follow the gun laws, and on the 10th it's going to actually go to the federal court to see if we can suppress those.
[02:44:41.918 --> 02:44:42.639]  Yeah.
[02:44:42.639 --> 02:44:44.200]  Our sheriffs did a good job with that.
[02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:44.500]  Yeah.
[02:44:44.500 --> 02:44:56.367]  My question, given the GMO, how much is actually in the food supply, is probably not coming out, so is there something that can counter it besides just not buying it?
[02:44:56.367 --> 02:44:57.848]  So what's your question then?
[02:44:58.462 --> 02:45:03.286]  Well, there's so much wheat and corn GMO that's not labeled and is in the food supply.
[02:45:03.286 --> 02:45:04.167]  Yeah.
[02:45:04.167 --> 02:45:08.871]  And we probably can't get it back out of the food supply, so I'm wondering what will counter that.
[02:45:08.871 --> 02:45:18.639]  Oh, well, I think that if we stop planting genetically modified corn and soy, the two largest, and cotton, the three largest GMO crops.
[02:45:18.639 --> 02:45:24.103]  Remember, wheat is not yet commercially genetically modified, even though it's been contaminated as such.
[02:45:24.103 --> 02:45:26.705]  But if we stop planting it, then I think the GMOs will
[02:45:27.806 --> 02:45:30.510]  Definitely go drastically down.
[02:45:30.510 --> 02:45:31.471]  We may never get rid of them.
[02:45:31.471 --> 02:45:37.980]  You're exactly right on that point because of the genetic pollution and contamination issue, but we can at least get them out of the food supply.
[02:45:37.980 --> 02:45:43.688]  You know, a lot of people don't know that a food can be labeled as GMO free even when it has
[02:45:44.389 --> 02:45:44.750]  That's great.
[02:46:00.228 --> 02:46:01.769]  That most Americans have no idea.
[02:46:01.769 --> 02:46:11.977]  For example, the USDA certified organic seal does not certify that your food doesn't have super high levels of lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and other heavy metals in it.
[02:46:11.977 --> 02:46:13.318]  They're not tested at all.
[02:46:13.318 --> 02:46:29.991]  So you can have certified organic food grown in China, imported into the United States, sold at health food stores that is heavily contaminated with lead, which causes developmental, you know, cognitive impairment in children, and also causes mental retardation, which I think we're seeing in the culture.
[02:46:30.891 --> 02:46:33.092]  So I hope that answers your question.
[02:46:33.092 --> 02:46:35.233]  I got off on a little tangent there.
[02:46:35.233 --> 02:46:38.395]  Anyway, but thank you for your call there, Mike.
[02:46:38.395 --> 02:46:40.496]  Let's go to Eric in Tennessee.
[02:46:40.496 --> 02:46:41.196]  Eric, you're on the air.
[02:46:41.196 --> 02:46:43.197]  Go ahead.
[02:46:43.197 --> 02:46:43.577]  Hey, Mike.
[02:46:43.577 --> 02:46:44.718]  How's it going today, bud?
[02:46:44.718 --> 02:46:45.418]  It's going pretty good.
[02:46:45.418 --> 02:46:54.362]  I'm having a good time here today, trying to mix it up and inform people and not have it too boring at the same time.
[02:46:55.083 --> 02:46:59.704]  Yeah, well, you went off on quite the tangent with the Napolitano thing there.
[02:46:59.704 --> 02:47:02.025]  That was visually striking.
[02:47:02.025 --> 02:47:02.565]  Yeah, wasn't it?
[02:47:02.565 --> 02:47:06.846]  Do you like that idea of Michael Moore and Janet Napolitano in matrimony?
[02:47:06.846 --> 02:47:09.827]  It blew up in my throat a little, you know?
[02:47:09.827 --> 02:47:12.107]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:47:12.107 --> 02:47:13.428]  I know the feeling.
[02:47:13.428 --> 02:47:15.228]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:47:15.228 --> 02:47:16.788]  I have just a couple of comments.
[02:47:16.788 --> 02:47:23.150]  I mean, I see these guys like Snowden, and to me it looks like, I mean,
[02:47:24.031 --> 02:47:26.372]  It really takes me back to the Revolutionary War.
[02:47:26.372 --> 02:47:29.933]  It's like they're running through the streets yelling the British are coming.
[02:47:29.933 --> 02:47:30.533]  Yeah.
[02:47:30.533 --> 02:47:30.993]  You know?
[02:47:30.993 --> 02:47:33.314]  I mean, those are our guys.
[02:47:33.314 --> 02:47:41.856]  And if the American people won't stand up for them and make more noise to get them back in this country and get them free,
[02:47:42.699 --> 02:47:44.100]  And let that information out?
[02:47:44.100 --> 02:47:46.061]  I mean, we've already lost.
[02:47:46.061 --> 02:47:54.627]  Well, yeah, that's the big issue, and that's what Snowden said was his greatest fear, is that the American people become aware of all of this, and then they sit back and do nothing.
[02:47:54.627 --> 02:48:06.395]  And the theory of why that's happening, at least the theory here at InfoWars, and I agree with it, is that the people are so dumbed down, their brain numbed, zombies, in a very
[02:48:07.276 --> 02:48:09.358]  Chemical sense there, you know, it's the fluoride.
[02:48:09.358 --> 02:48:10.800]  It's the heavy metals in the food.
[02:48:10.800 --> 02:48:26.816]  We just talked about it's the GMOs It's all these things people are being stupefied That's not the correct use of that term, but they're being made into brain dead zombies by the chemical assault which is deliberate I believe
[02:48:28.396 --> 02:48:38.221]  Since I started listening to Alex Jones, it's been about a year and a half since I actually woke up and looked around and saw the disaster that was going on around me.
[02:48:38.221 --> 02:48:40.021]  I've turned off my Dish Network.
[02:48:40.021 --> 02:48:40.602]  Yep.
[02:48:40.602 --> 02:48:41.382]  Completely.
[02:48:41.382 --> 02:48:44.924]  I've cut myself off from all of that mainstream crap.
[02:48:44.924 --> 02:48:47.445]  I don't even look at it online anymore.
[02:48:47.445 --> 02:48:48.005]  Yeah.
[02:48:48.005 --> 02:48:51.006]  I mean, I get my news directly from mplewars.com.
[02:48:51.006 --> 02:48:52.827]  I listen to Glenn Beck occasionally.
[02:48:52.827 --> 02:48:54.148]  I know that's a no-no.
[02:48:55.069 --> 02:49:00.111]  He does make some good points, and he does give tips to Alex Jones every once in a while.
[02:49:00.111 --> 02:49:05.633]  He will kind of nod his way, even though he says he tries to kill him, which I don't understand that.
[02:49:05.633 --> 02:49:06.813]  No, I don't get that either.
[02:49:06.813 --> 02:49:23.239]  I mean, yeah, I listen to Glenn Beck maybe once a month when somebody sends me a tip, but the last tip he had was it was going to be this huge announcement that would bring down the government, and I was like, wow, cool, Glenn Beck is going to do some big whistleblowing thing, and then the next day it was like nothing, and he never talked about it.
[02:49:23.239 --> 02:49:23.879]  I don't know what happened.
[02:49:24.731 --> 02:49:29.336]  I think he got pressured just like they got pressured in the UK and pulled that story from the paper.
[02:49:29.336 --> 02:49:30.978]  Why would you pre-announce it?
[02:49:30.978 --> 02:49:39.006]  If you have intelligence that's going to quote, bring down the government, you don't go on the air the day before and announce that you have that information.
[02:49:39.710 --> 02:49:44.894]  Oh, you know, he was eating curl for a week over that, you know, but I mean, the government had to have leaned on him.
[02:49:44.894 --> 02:49:48.197]  Somebody somewhere leaned on him and said, you know, you do this.
[02:49:48.197 --> 02:49:49.718]  If you do this, you're a dead man.
[02:49:49.718 --> 02:49:57.184]  Well, yeah, I mean, if you have that information, you got to get it out immediately so that you aren't the person that they can kill to stop it.
[02:49:58.109 --> 02:50:02.870]  But see, to me, that was a big disappointment in Glenn Beck.
[02:50:02.870 --> 02:50:04.950]  I know it can happen to anybody.
[02:50:04.950 --> 02:50:08.751]  Maybe his source changed his mind, and so that promise was broken to him.
[02:50:08.751 --> 02:50:09.631]  Maybe it's not his fault.
[02:50:09.631 --> 02:50:10.272]  I don't know.
[02:50:10.272 --> 02:50:11.752]  But I hear you.
[02:50:11.752 --> 02:50:13.272]  Do you have another question?
[02:50:13.272 --> 02:50:14.872]  Yeah, I have one more comment.
[02:50:14.872 --> 02:50:22.234]  The Xbox 360 that they're replacing with the Xbox One, you know, the Kinect sensor that you put on the old 360?
[02:50:22.234 --> 02:50:24.114]  Right, right.
[02:50:24.114 --> 02:50:25.935]  I unplugged mine like a year ago.
[02:50:25.935 --> 02:50:27.035]  Yeah, because it's watching you.
[02:50:27.808 --> 02:50:29.329]  It unplugs from the back of the 360.
[02:50:29.329 --> 02:50:34.253]  I don't know, you know, a lot of people don't seem to realize that, but you can just unplug that bad boy.
[02:50:34.253 --> 02:50:41.398]  It's not as sensitive and it's not as good, but if you turn it on picture mode, that thing has a better camera than my back camera phone.
[02:50:41.772 --> 02:50:49.794]  Well, not only can you unplug it, but you can take your Xbox 360 and you can set it on some cinder blocks and you can blast it with a Barrett 50 Cal.
[02:50:49.794 --> 02:50:52.395]  That also renders it inoperable.
[02:50:52.395 --> 02:50:57.617]  So that's what I would suggest to do in legal and lawful areas only.
[02:50:57.617 --> 02:50:58.397]  But thanks for your calls.
[02:50:58.397 --> 02:50:58.977]  More straight ahead.
[02:50:58.977 --> 02:51:00.118]  This is the Alex Jones Show.

[02:52:01.072 --> 02:52:10.378]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:52:10.378 --> 02:52:11.158]  This capitalism?
[02:52:11.158 --> 02:52:17.342]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:52:17.342 --> 02:52:21.025]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[02:52:35.933 --> 02:52:42.556]  HempUSA.org has a complete full-spectrum vitamin mineral detox formulation called Micro Plant Powder Gold.

[02:53:00.743 --> 02:53:04.206]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[02:53:04.206 --> 02:53:07.288]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[02:53:07.288 --> 02:53:10.090]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[02:53:10.090 --> 02:53:13.552]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[02:53:13.552 --> 02:53:19.777]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer.
[02:53:20.077 --> 02:53:22.118]  Wonder if there'll really be a problem?

[02:54:15.575 --> 02:54:18.097]  All right, we're back in the last segment here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:18.097 --> 02:54:19.958]  We're going to continue with your calls in a minute.
[02:54:19.958 --> 02:54:24.101]  I want to plug this book that I think is really important for our time.
[02:54:24.101 --> 02:54:29.665]  It's called The Founder's Bible, The Origin of the Dream of Freedom by David Barton.
[02:54:29.665 --> 02:54:30.986]  The Founder's Bible.
[02:54:30.986 --> 02:54:34.208]  This was sent to me recently by a friend.
[02:54:34.208 --> 02:54:37.531]  And this Bible not only is a Bible,
[02:54:38.271 --> 02:54:58.013]  But it's a New American Standard Bible with lots of explanations, but also it goes into the history of America and why it is a nation that was founded on Christian principles and beliefs, and how that became part of the philosophy that was eventually encoded in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and many other key documents and key decisions.
[02:54:58.934 --> 02:55:03.720]  Check out that book, and also check out this movie, State of Mind, The Psychology of Control.
[02:55:03.720 --> 02:55:06.323]  This is available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:55:06.323 --> 02:55:08.826]  It's called State of Mind.
[02:55:08.826 --> 02:55:10.548]  I can't wait to see this video.
[02:55:10.548 --> 02:55:14.232]  Like I said, guys, I'm stealing this copy, okay?
[02:55:14.232 --> 02:55:14.933]  I'm taking it home.
[02:55:18.078 --> 02:55:19.739]  They said the case might be empty.
[02:55:19.739 --> 02:55:25.184]  It's like your theft-proof copy here in the studio.
[02:55:25.184 --> 02:55:30.067]  There's all kinds of interesting things here behind Alex's desk.
[02:55:30.067 --> 02:55:33.270]  I'm not going to steal anything, I promise.
[02:55:33.270 --> 02:55:37.893]  But State of Mind is one of the videos that... Oh, it ships out on the 15th of July.
[02:55:37.893 --> 02:55:40.595]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[02:55:40.595 --> 02:55:41.636]  Jamie in Michigan.
[02:55:41.636 --> 02:55:42.356]  Jamie, you're on the air.
[02:55:42.356 --> 02:55:42.657]  Go ahead.
[02:55:44.008 --> 02:55:44.908]  Hi, Mike.
[02:55:44.908 --> 02:55:47.209]  Hey.
[02:55:47.209 --> 02:55:49.870]  I had two comments and a question for you.
[02:55:49.870 --> 02:55:50.891]  I'll try to make them quick.
[02:55:50.891 --> 02:55:52.412]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:55:52.412 --> 02:55:58.014]  The first comment is, I've been pretty awake since 9-11.
[02:55:58.014 --> 02:56:05.137]  And I've, you know, progressively and progressively got more and more upset with not being able to figure out why, what to do about it.
[02:56:05.137 --> 02:56:07.098]  And I watched Network.
[02:56:07.098 --> 02:56:10.859]  And the movie where the guy freaks out on the Newcastle show.
[02:56:10.859 --> 02:56:11.279]  Right.
[02:56:11.279 --> 02:56:12.500]  And he gets all the people to scream
[02:56:12.500 --> 02:56:12.800]  Good advice.
[02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:13.320]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:56:13.320 --> 02:56:14.121]  People should exercise that.
[02:56:14.121 --> 02:56:19.682]  But see, everybody's being scared into a state of cowardice where they think that voicing your opinion is not acceptable or
[02:56:39.989 --> 02:56:41.210]  Politically correct.
[02:56:41.210 --> 02:56:42.771]  You know, you're not supposed to speak out in America.
[02:56:42.771 --> 02:56:44.373]  That's the new thing.
[02:56:44.373 --> 02:56:50.958]  But those of us who aren't afraid, who are willing to stand up for liberty and say, I'm not afraid of you, our voices will be heard by those people who are.
[02:56:50.958 --> 02:56:51.878]  That's right.
[02:56:51.878 --> 02:56:56.742]  We do have some people on our side and it'll snowball effect 1pm.
[02:56:56.742 --> 02:56:58.464]  I'm really trying to promote this month.
[02:56:58.464 --> 02:57:00.245]  Everybody I know, I got a group.
[02:57:00.245 --> 02:57:06.730]  I'm mad at telling I'm not going to take it anymore on Facebook for people to join up, trying to get people active.
[02:57:06.730 --> 02:57:06.970]  All right.
[02:57:06.970 --> 02:57:08.912]  So the group name is I'm not going to take it anymore.
[02:57:10.034 --> 02:57:12.115]  I'm mad as hell, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[02:57:12.115 --> 02:57:12.735]  I'm mad as hell.
[02:57:12.735 --> 02:57:14.935]  They have a little ROPSYS next to it.
[02:57:14.935 --> 02:57:17.396]  It's an open group.
[02:57:17.396 --> 02:57:18.856]  You might have to ask to join.
[02:57:18.856 --> 02:57:21.877]  Accepting all invitations.
[02:57:21.877 --> 02:57:23.437]  Well, that's cool.
[02:57:23.437 --> 02:57:24.438]  People, you can check out the group.
[02:57:24.438 --> 02:57:25.898]  I'm mad as hell, not going to take it anymore.
[02:57:25.898 --> 02:57:26.998]  Group on Facebook.
[02:57:26.998 --> 02:57:28.139]  Thanks for the call.
[02:57:28.139 --> 02:57:31.139]  But I agree with you, Jamie, that we've got to voice our opinions.
[02:57:31.139 --> 02:57:31.980]  That's why I'm here.
[02:57:31.980 --> 02:57:34.160]  I know that's why Alex is here as well.
[02:57:34.160 --> 02:57:36.021]  Let's go to Michael in Texas.
[02:57:36.021 --> 02:57:36.921]  Michael, welcome to the show.
[02:57:39.458 --> 02:57:42.201]  Oh, thanks for taking my call, Mike.
[02:57:42.201 --> 02:57:43.803]  Yeah, just a couple of things.
[02:57:43.803 --> 02:57:45.665]  You are a favorite.
[02:57:45.665 --> 02:57:47.547]  We're glad to have you on the show anytime you come on.
[02:57:47.547 --> 02:57:50.590]  Glad to have you here.
[02:57:50.590 --> 02:57:52.573]  And I'd like to make a comment about Ronnie Rieferseed.
[02:57:52.573 --> 02:57:55.095]  He is one fantastic info warrior.
[02:57:55.095 --> 02:57:57.158]  He doesn't miss a commissioners meeting.
[02:57:57.158 --> 02:57:59.220]  He's down at City Hall every chance he gets.
[02:57:59.835 --> 02:58:04.199]  And if all the listeners would at least put out half of that effort, we can get a whole lot further along down the road.
[02:58:18.235 --> 02:58:22.697]  So I've got to let you go there, but thank you all for listening today and thank you for your calls.
[02:58:22.697 --> 02:58:24.758]  Thank you for all of you for your support.
[02:58:24.758 --> 02:58:30.321]  Infowars.com is the website where you can check out the news, Infowars store, the products that support this broadcast.
[02:58:30.321 --> 02:58:32.742]  Thank you, crew, for your great job today.
[02:58:32.742 --> 02:58:35.063]  Thank all of you for putting up with me.
[02:58:35.063 --> 02:58:36.924]  I'll be back whenever Alex asks me back.
[02:58:36.924 --> 02:58:39.084]  This is Mike Adams signing off on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:58:39.084 --> 02:58:39.845]  Take care, everybody.
