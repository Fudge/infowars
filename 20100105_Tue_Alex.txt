[00:00.000 --> 00:12.680]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.680 --> 00:21.440]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.440 --> 00:35.120]  I am beside myself with grief with anger with disgust the state of the United
[00:35.120 --> 00:42.840]  States and the rest of the planet being swallowed being dragged inch by inch foot
[00:42.840 --> 00:47.720]  by foot mile by mile into the maw into the gaping mouth of the technological
[00:47.720 --> 00:54.600]  enslavement grid we knew it was coming we knew nationwide every major airport
[00:54.600 --> 00:58.160]  would get full-body scanners and that incrementally everyone would be forced
[00:58.160 --> 01:02.520]  to go through them I've pointed out many times that it is legally child
[01:02.520 --> 01:07.080]  pornography the London Guardian has that on their front page today and the
[01:07.080 --> 01:10.440]  government says well for national security we wave it we're going to scan
[01:10.440 --> 01:15.480]  and record your two-year-old your five-year-old your wife yourself your
[01:15.480 --> 01:23.160]  genitalia turd off is making money off of it along with many others in the last
[01:23.160 --> 01:27.800]  several administrations it's a revolving door billions and billions of
[01:27.800 --> 01:32.960]  dollars a year worldwide the body scanners are going in and they're not
[01:32.960 --> 01:36.960]  going to stop there and this is an act of humiliation public humiliation where
[01:36.960 --> 01:44.560]  you go up you get scanned it gets recorded I'm seeing mainstream news photos
[01:44.560 --> 01:49.000]  of the body scanners in use in the u.s. with images of men standing there
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.320]  looking at the screen while women are scanned looking at their breast looking
[01:54.320 --> 01:59.640]  at their this is part of humiliation if they can make us do this they can make
[01:59.640 --> 02:04.360]  us do anything no Clinton signed an executive order didn't mean they
[02:04.360 --> 02:08.720]  implemented it but they signed executive order to set up urine and blood
[02:08.720 --> 02:13.800]  sampling centers at all DMVs in the u.s. under the real ID act you thought the
[02:13.800 --> 02:20.520]  real idea came after 9-11 no my film 1997 America destroyed by design shows the
[02:20.520 --> 02:23.600]  executive order the documents I go in and protest it and get arrested in the
[02:23.600 --> 02:30.080]  DMV now in multiple states many states of the u.s. including Texas under federal
[02:30.080 --> 02:34.360]  grants they've passed state laws to get the federal money warrantless blood
[02:34.360 --> 02:42.120]  taking at checkpoints they announce on the news no more warrants they're not
[02:42.120 --> 02:46.160]  going to stop in the airports mobile vans are being purchased by cities like
[02:46.160 --> 02:50.000]  New York and Boston mobile vans have been in use for at least five years in
[02:50.000 --> 02:54.080]  England you want to know where all the blue collar people are that can't get
[02:54.080 --> 03:00.520]  jobs and still mills or in factories or in power plants or in shopping malls
[03:00.520 --> 03:06.360]  they are going to be the guard the guild that scans tracks and traces the other
[03:06.360 --> 03:12.480]  blue collar workers and middle-class workers we are the milk cows by the way
[03:12.480 --> 03:17.720]  it is not a privilege to travel you've been taught that now you're being taught
[03:17.720 --> 03:20.480]  it's a privilege to not be spied on now you're being taught it's a privileged
[03:20.480 --> 03:25.800]  on a gun and the foolish police and enforcers actually believe the lies
[03:25.800 --> 03:34.440]  they're taught none of it is a privilege it is a right but they use
[03:34.440 --> 03:41.520]  contract law and slick color of law to sell it it is a privilege to fly on
[03:41.520 --> 03:50.360]  American Airlines or United Airlines or to fly on continental or on Northwest
[03:50.360 --> 03:56.960]  because they are private companies and that's how this fraud is being carried
[03:56.960 --> 04:02.000]  out you don't have to body scan for general aviation when you go fly your
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.520]  Cessna or your company charters a private jet though the feds are now moving to
[04:07.520 --> 04:12.080]  make you body scan to get on board those aircraft by threatening and forcing the
[04:12.080 --> 04:16.400]  companies to go along with this and that is illegal and unconstitutional so we'll
[04:16.400 --> 04:21.520]  go over that fraud as well and my plan was in the embryonic phases the last few
[04:21.520 --> 04:25.600]  months but it's taking shape in my mind I'd like to hear your ideas on it before

[04:48.640 --> 04:54.720]  going into absolute bondage right now and I am fired up about exposing it

[08:05.760 --> 08:10.760]  show because there's a war on for your mind
[08:11.760 --> 08:20.200]  London Independent reported our planned airport scanners just a scam new
[08:20.200 --> 08:24.360]  technology that Gordon Brown relies on for his response to the Christmas Day
[08:24.360 --> 08:31.480]  bomb attack has been tested and found wanting the explosives device smuggled
[08:31.480 --> 08:35.920]  in the clothing of the Detroit bomb suspect would not have been detected
[08:35.920 --> 08:40.120]  by body scanners set to be introduced in British airports an expert on the
[08:40.120 --> 08:44.600]  technology warned last night by the way I want to get that expert on the show
[08:44.600 --> 08:48.400]  from this article London Guardian is reporting what I've been telling you
[08:48.400 --> 08:56.600]  for years this is child pornography it is the most gross violation of your
[08:56.600 --> 09:02.320]  privacy rights seen yet though next they will push taser bracelets for all and
[09:02.320 --> 09:07.720]  implantable microchips this is the official Pentagon plan declassified in
[09:07.720 --> 09:14.040]  January of 2000 documented in my book the sent into tyranny and in road to
[09:14.040 --> 09:19.000]  tyranny the Mexican Attorney General and many other Attorney Generals in
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.480]  Latin America have made their employees take the chips in the last four years
[09:23.480 --> 09:31.040]  this is really going on this has nothing to do with security for the general
[09:31.040 --> 09:35.880]  public it has to do with security for the ruling class knowing that they plan
[09:35.880 --> 09:40.240]  to shut off resources and bankrupt the planet to bring in an authoritarian
[09:40.240 --> 09:47.000]  scientific dictatorship this is a system to track and control everything you do
[09:47.000 --> 09:53.560]  so you can be bankrupted in an orderly fashion brought under the control of
[09:53.560 --> 09:58.640]  government dependency so one child policies can be employed so forced
[09:58.640 --> 10:02.800]  abortions can be employed now being called for officially by the United
[10:02.800 --> 10:08.600]  Nations and pundits all over radio TV and print in the Western world this is a
[10:08.600 --> 10:19.000]  hellish situation that we face the time for denial is over and I look at
[10:19.000 --> 10:24.600]  middle-class working-class Americans when I'm in the grocery store when I'm
[10:24.600 --> 10:28.360]  out front in my neighborhood when my children are riding around on their
[10:28.360 --> 10:32.960]  bicycles and scooters I look at the yuppies pull up get out of their
[10:32.960 --> 10:37.680]  middle-class cars go into their middle-class houses and they're thinking
[10:37.680 --> 10:43.800]  about their golf score they're thinking about the negligee they bought for
[10:43.800 --> 10:48.840]  their wife their wife is thinking about their bikini line we are a decadent
[10:48.840 --> 10:56.560]  dumb-down population that has no idea how much trouble we're in and Americans
[10:56.560 --> 11:01.480]  and people of the West don't think of it as their role to be fighters for
[11:01.480 --> 11:07.080]  liberty to be politically involved Americans don't see it as their role to
[11:07.080 --> 11:12.920]  be involved that's for experts and politicians and rights organizations and
[11:12.920 --> 11:20.280]  think tanks that's not for them to do and because you've had that attitude you
[11:20.280 --> 11:26.280]  have been completely robbed financial numbers are coming in they only confirm
[11:26.280 --> 11:35.240]  what we already knew we have been in recession for four years a recession
[11:35.240 --> 11:41.320]  for three quarters with over a 20% unemployment rate is
[11:41.320 --> 11:47.520]  depressionary we are in a depression but the big banks the fortune 100 are
[11:47.520 --> 11:51.480]  making record profits as they consolidate the economy with their
[11:51.480 --> 11:57.320]  slash-and-burn operation and so they tell you the economy is great US growth
[11:57.320 --> 12:04.240]  prospects deemed bleak in New Decade Reuters reports Wall Street Journal
[12:04.240 --> 12:11.080]  reports personal bankruptcy filings rising fast economic policy journal
[12:11.080 --> 12:15.680]  reports Robert Rubin says all hell could break loose because of huge
[12:15.680 --> 12:20.720]  government debt remember he is the main if anyone can be singled out Robert
[12:20.720 --> 12:26.680]  Rubin is one of the main ringleaders or kingpins you can't say the ultimate but
[12:26.680 --> 12:33.280]  of the top three engineers of this it is Larry Summers Robert Rubin and Alan
[12:33.280 --> 12:39.560]  Greenspan they are the captains of the New World Order's economic operation
[12:39.560 --> 12:42.840]  doesn't mean they're the owners but they are the captains running the
[12:42.840 --> 12:48.880]  engagement on the high seas of piracy you can liken it to a ground engagement
[12:48.880 --> 12:55.240]  they are the field marshals they are the generals they are the chiefs of staff
[12:55.680 --> 13:02.160]  and you've always got to love how these criminals with their allied minions like
[13:02.160 --> 13:05.520]  George Soros always testify before Congress and tell us about all the
[13:05.520 --> 13:12.040]  problems they engineered by design Americans job satisfaction falls to
[13:12.040 --> 13:16.720]  record low conservatively there's really 22 percent all the major private
[13:16.720 --> 13:21.480]  firms come up with 20 to 23 percent unemployment the government says 10.2
[13:21.480 --> 13:29.600]  complete fantasy American job satisfaction falls to record low only 45% of
[13:29.600 --> 13:34.160]  Americans are satisfied with their job because the money won't make ends meet
[13:34.160 --> 13:38.560]  also the government is hiding the health care bills behind closed doors
[13:38.560 --> 13:41.400]  they've changed it yet again aren't letting people know what changes are
[13:41.400 --> 13:45.520]  being made in conference committee US News and World Report reports
[13:45.520 --> 13:49.440]  Democratic leaders plan secret health care reform deliberations isn't that
[13:49.440 --> 13:57.080]  freedom no it's not so that some of the economic news will be going over today
[13:57.080 --> 14:09.440]  inflation is so bad that the federal government is talking about within the
[14:09.440 --> 14:15.680]  decade phasing out coin money entirely because the fractions of quarters and
[14:15.680 --> 14:23.360]  below won't even be able to buy anything they've introduced the different
[14:23.360 --> 14:28.240]  color denominations of money preparing you to completely phase out cash
[14:28.240 --> 14:32.640]  well there'll still be cash coupons you can print out but they'll be digitally
[14:32.640 --> 14:37.760]  tracked with your name assigned to them ladies and gentlemen all I do is study
[14:37.760 --> 14:49.440]  the enemy's operations and I am blown over I am stunned I am completely dumb
[14:49.440 --> 14:55.760]  founded by the magnitude the organizational system how it's worldwide
[14:55.760 --> 14:58.800]  being deployed simultaneously and I'll just go back to what I've been talking
[14:58.800 --> 15:05.600]  about for 14 years to illustrate this for you for 37 years anyone born in the
[15:05.600 --> 15:09.680]  Western world from Australia to the United States had their blood taken and
[15:09.680 --> 15:15.880]  put in a secret UN human genome bio weapons program genetic engineering
[15:15.880 --> 15:21.040]  program now declassified in the last three years now mainstream news I mean
[15:21.040 --> 15:31.720]  that is hardcore they are poisoning our water they are adding sterilants they
[15:31.720 --> 15:35.160]  are adding lithium they are adding sodium fluoride and that's the catch all
[15:35.160 --> 15:39.600]  name for on average over 150 chemicals that are deadly added to water
[15:39.600 --> 15:47.880]  supplies and the public was preconditioned as corruption came out in the last 50
[15:47.880 --> 15:52.160]  years and his government corruption came to the surface the media chanted the
[15:52.160 --> 15:55.920]  mantra only coops talk about government corruption you're not supposed to talk
[15:55.920 --> 15:58.920]  about politics and religion in polite circles you're not supposed to be
[15:58.920 --> 16:02.400]  politically involved as Americans that's on American when actually it's the
[16:02.400 --> 16:08.600]  opposite of being on American it's totally American to be involved in our
[16:08.600 --> 16:14.320]  tradition until the people bought into lies incrementally over and over and
[16:14.320 --> 16:21.920]  over and over and over and over again until the most science fiction ask most
[16:21.920 --> 16:28.600]  diabolical things we can even imagine are all in full swing and full
[16:28.600 --> 16:36.120]  implementation they're not going to stop with the body scanners just in the
[16:36.120 --> 16:39.280]  airports they've already announced it's going to go nationwide they're not just
[16:39.280 --> 16:43.680]  going to stop with the TSA as I told you seven years ago in the airports they're
[16:43.680 --> 16:48.200]  going on to the streets of America and they have now for five years they're
[16:48.200 --> 16:53.400]  not going to stop anywhere the feds are training police from Austin Texas to New
[16:53.400 --> 16:58.840]  York City to randomly at public events open-air festivals shut down large
[16:58.840 --> 17:05.640]  areas of the city and search people randomly what is it now a privilege to
[17:05.640 --> 17:11.280]  be able to walk in downtown Manhattan is it now a privilege to be able to walk in
[17:11.280 --> 17:20.320]  downtown Dallas or in Los Angeles or in Detroit being wanded by police randomly
[17:20.320 --> 17:24.000]  out there under federal funding and federal training searching people see
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.320]  first they tell you it's a privilege to drive then a privilege to fly then a
[17:27.320 --> 17:31.880]  privilege to own a gun it is not a privilege to do any of those things and
[17:31.880 --> 17:38.960]  now you're being told it's a wonderful security feature to be walked through in
[17:38.960 --> 17:44.440]  body scan 360 as that machine spins around you radiating you with high
[17:44.440 --> 17:49.000]  powered millimeter waves that major university reports and independent
[17:49.000 --> 17:56.080]  scientific journals have all reported fries your body with something the
[17:56.080 --> 18:07.160]  equivalent to a chest x-ray here are the headlines at prison planet calm this is
[18:07.160 --> 18:18.800]  a maximum level alert these articles must be sent to the four winds they must

[22:25.080 --> 22:29.520]  ever experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an institution that
[22:29.520 --> 22:32.720]  is not accountable to our elected government but has also caused the

[24:50.360 --> 24:55.280]  in back rooms get ready to enjoy your naked children this article we're going
[24:55.280 --> 24:58.920]  to add some other photos of the TSA actually scanning women we have the
[24:58.920 --> 25:04.000]  photo up there of the body scan the completely naked woman being recorded
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.920]  and notice every photo of a body scan they put out they show somebody with a
[25:07.920 --> 25:12.720]  gun and knife to legitimize the idea that every time a body scan is done
[25:12.720 --> 25:16.560]  there's a weapon that's the subconscious message that's put out and I
[25:16.560 --> 25:23.720]  remember in 2001 reading the minutes of a huge conference a convention that was
[25:23.720 --> 25:29.840]  held in Chicago by the biometric slash RFID consortiums where one of the
[25:29.840 --> 25:34.280]  leaders of the event in the banquet hall in front of thousands said our
[25:34.280 --> 25:39.360]  studies show that upwards of 80% of people hate these technologies but it
[25:39.360 --> 25:42.800]  doesn't matter our studies also show that if we just force it they will
[25:42.800 --> 25:46.760]  scream and yell but that they will submit I'm paraphrasing it but he did say
[25:46.760 --> 25:51.880]  submit and that's what they're doing if they can get away with recording your
[25:51.880 --> 25:56.200]  sons and your daughters and your wife and yourself naked they can get away
[25:56.200 --> 26:01.080]  with anything don't you understand and I keep telling you for years that all the
[26:01.080 --> 26:06.080]  major heads of Homeland Security churn off you name it Ridge all make massive
[26:06.080 --> 26:11.040]  money off this and it came out this year actually last year now 2009 that
[26:11.040 --> 26:14.600]  Governor Ridge admitted they were issuing fake terror alerts for political
[26:14.600 --> 26:19.320]  gain and to sell security systems that the military industrial complex is
[26:19.320 --> 26:23.640]  peddling it isn't enough for the military industrial complex to get a
[26:23.640 --> 26:27.680]  trillion 300 billion conservatively and that's on budget they had another 600
[26:27.680 --> 26:31.240]  billion conservatively in black budgets you're getting up close to 2 trillion a
[26:31.240 --> 26:37.000]  year 2 trillion a year more than all the state budgets combined and more it
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.680]  isn't enough for them now the military industrial complex contractors are
[26:40.680 --> 26:44.680]  running the face scanning cameras the license plate reading cameras the
[26:44.680 --> 26:50.200]  toll road systems the red light cameras the body scanners the body scanning
[26:50.200 --> 26:55.480]  vans the training of your local police they're totally taking over our economy
[26:55.480 --> 27:00.280]  and feeding all of our tax money in to a system they profit from and that they're
[27:00.280 --> 27:05.640]  using to set up an electronic humiliation straightjacket all of us it's
[27:05.640 --> 27:10.680]  hot reason and I'm trying not to get angry you know I'm trying to be calm
[27:10.680 --> 27:15.640]  during the breaks I was literally yelling and screaming because there's no
[27:15.640 --> 27:19.280]  way for us to write the articles for info wars dot com and prison planet dot
[27:19.280 --> 27:24.840]  com describing every facet of this evil and how bad it really is I'm so angry
[27:24.840 --> 27:28.720]  folks I can't normally jog for more than 30 minutes on my treadmill and then I've
[27:28.720 --> 27:32.440]  got to walk the rest of the way I basically ran for the entire hour this

[33:58.960 --> 34:03.080]  primary peddlers of child porn as I've been saying for years with these body
[34:03.080 --> 34:11.080]  scanners the London Guardian has a similar headline today and you can go
[34:11.080 --> 34:15.600]  there and see what the body scanners really reveal the national news
[34:15.600 --> 34:20.520]  continues to show blurred images obviously they can't show pornography on
[34:20.520 --> 34:25.600]  the morning or nightly news but if you go to these multiple companies that have
[34:25.600 --> 34:29.760]  gotten multi-billion dollar year contracts to put these in all 214 major
[34:29.760 --> 34:34.160]  airports at every security checkpoint and phase in everyone having to go
[34:34.160 --> 34:37.120]  through them notice they start incrementally with a few airports and
[34:37.120 --> 34:43.080]  only a few they pull out now they're going for everybody if you actually look
[34:43.080 --> 34:48.480]  at the real scans ladies and gentlemen you can find giant images of these all
[34:48.480 --> 34:55.240]  over the web from the companies you can focus in on a mole next to a woman's

[35:06.840 --> 35:12.040]  another headline under it just as important as all the details Alex Jones
[35:12.040 --> 35:19.640]  calls for mass resistance to implementation of body scanners get these
[35:19.640 --> 35:25.160]  articles post them on your blog or website print them off take them to work
[35:25.160 --> 35:28.760]  but you may get fired for showing pornography might want to show it to
[35:28.760 --> 35:32.480]  your boss and say can we speak out against this can we as Americans stand
[35:32.480 --> 35:35.560]  up don't you want to say something oh that's not our place here at work we're
[35:35.560 --> 35:39.280]  all supposed to just keep our heads down train our replacements our third world
[35:39.280 --> 35:46.400]  worker replacements from India and China and just go into bankruptcy no foreign
[35:46.400 --> 35:49.680]  banks have seized the country they're looting us and now they're training us
[35:49.680 --> 35:54.960]  to submit to total tyranny and I'm going to break it all down here in just a
[35:54.960 --> 36:03.800]  moment but I want to play this clip John McLaughlin freedom is most overrated
[36:03.800 --> 36:10.200]  political issue of 2009 everywhere I hear the pundits say give up your freedom
[36:10.200 --> 36:15.440]  or terrorists will kill you and then you look at the historical evidence the
[36:15.440 --> 36:21.080]  government is staging nine out of ten of the terrorist attacks and provocaturing
[36:21.080 --> 36:25.800]  the others you have a much better chance hundreds and hundreds of times the
[36:25.800 --> 36:30.880]  chance you could pull up the statistics to die in a car wreck or to drown or to
[36:30.880 --> 36:35.560]  fall and hit your head then to be killed by a terrorist it's a joke it's the
[36:35.560 --> 36:39.800]  excuse for the corrupt empire to take over the world and domesticate us and
[36:39.800 --> 36:45.640]  enslave us here domestically and the general public better decide to get
[36:45.640 --> 36:50.000]  angry and start going and speaking before city council and you better start
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.160]  calling the airports and the airlines and I want everybody I'm gonna talk in
[36:54.160 --> 36:57.920]  the fourth hour today exclusively on this would open the phones up on it on how
[36:57.920 --> 37:01.120]  you think we should boycott these people so think about it in the next few hours
[37:01.120 --> 37:05.240]  after Max Kaiser leaves us and micro vero leaves us we're gonna go live at
[37:05.240 --> 37:09.960]  prisonplanet.tv and t-minus 23 minutes in the second third and fourth hour I
[37:09.960 --> 37:14.360]  want you to brainstorm and think about the best boycotts and the best way to
[37:14.360 --> 37:18.160]  stand up against these people and launch it now don't wait get on the
[37:18.160 --> 37:22.520]  telephone pick at the airports they'll make you stand out front before the main
[37:22.520 --> 37:25.720]  entrance they'll try to harass you and say for security purposes you can't even
[37:25.720 --> 37:30.440]  have a placard just like you can try to stand on the edge off of Walmart
[37:30.440 --> 37:33.640]  property and they still call the police on you if you protest their slave goods
[37:33.640 --> 37:37.880]  I've seen the videos this country is going into bondage you think they were
[37:37.880 --> 37:43.760]  just gonna stop at the G20 last year in Pittsburgh telling people no one allowed
[37:43.760 --> 37:47.880]  on the streets of the city of over a million people police dogs attacking
[37:47.880 --> 37:53.000]  women coming out of shops with bags of goods going on the university where
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.120]  students were in the park at night attacking them my reporter Rob do getting
[37:57.120 --> 37:59.680]  arrested
[38:00.320 --> 38:04.720]  that's what's going on in America
[38:09.240 --> 38:15.600]  we have been hijacked here's McLaughlin saying the most overrated thing in
[38:15.600 --> 38:21.680]  2009 is freedom yeah freedom's a bad thing okay the most overrated pack global
[38:21.680 --> 38:27.800]  warming Charlie Christ who turns out was mostly an absentee governor Tim
[38:27.800 --> 38:31.560]  Geithner supposed boy genius just had to be Treasury Secretary has been a
[38:31.560 --> 38:35.400]  complete disappointment more the leaders of most of our major financial
[38:35.400 --> 38:40.360]  institutions in this country the most overrated is freedom when faced with
[38:40.360 --> 38:43.960]  economic uncertainty people don't want freedom when they can't see their
[38:43.960 --> 38:50.000]  economic future they want the nanny state okay the most underrated no the
[38:50.000 --> 38:56.840]  people don't want the nanny state McLaughlin Gallup polls showed 99% in
[38:56.840 --> 39:03.200]  October of 2008 when they passed the banker bank takeover they already had
[39:03.200 --> 39:10.320]  control of the currency but they got a blank check 99% even Barbara Boxer got up
[39:10.320 --> 39:13.600]  on the House floor and admitted she was getting a thousand to one phone calls
[39:13.600 --> 39:19.120]  against the banker takeover a thousand to one I had other congressman on this
[39:19.120 --> 39:24.720]  show to say they were getting 200 300 400 500 a thousand one congressman said
[39:24.720 --> 39:31.600]  no calls for it no the people don't want your stinking nanny state and it's a
[39:31.600 --> 39:36.120]  nanny state that literally sucks the blood out of you
[39:36.120 --> 39:49.320]  we need to get upset and we need to stay upset and we need to turn the tide
[39:49.320 --> 39:53.160]  against these people we did it on gun grabbing they have to covertly now with
[39:53.160 --> 39:56.720]  regulation go after the second amendment because we've gone from polls in the
[39:56.720 --> 40:02.520]  60s right at 50 54 gun control to now almost every major poll I see over 70
[40:02.520 --> 40:08.600]  percent of Americans want to reduce gun laws over 90% I've seen Gallup polls of
[40:08.600 --> 40:14.120]  as high as 91% the averages in the mid 80s want to control our borders and stop
[40:14.120 --> 40:17.760]  letting legal and illegal immigrants pour into our country we've won that fight
[40:17.760 --> 40:23.840]  intellectually when Roe v Wade was passed in the early 1970s in 1973 the
[40:23.840 --> 40:28.560]  Supreme Court ruling then state laws were passed to get in line with it over
[40:28.560 --> 40:37.000]  60% were for abortion now over 60% are against abortion I've seen national
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.680]  polls of higher than 80% against the body scanners even when the fed staged
[40:41.680 --> 40:46.720]  the underwear bomber event to coincide with the open announcement of body
[40:46.720 --> 40:50.080]  scanners going in everywhere they ordered them years ago they announced
[40:50.080 --> 40:54.520]  last year almost a year ago they were going in early 2009 then they have the
[40:54.520 --> 40:58.720]  event and within minutes they announced body scanners are going in don't worry
[40:58.720 --> 41:03.200]  it was all staged right online with the open announcements in the weeks before
[41:03.200 --> 41:13.480]  the underwear bombing that they had to go into Yemen it's all scripted it's all
[41:13.480 --> 41:27.280]  completely and totally scripted and I beg you the listeners I beg you the
[41:27.280 --> 41:35.240]  listeners to go to prison planet calm and to print this article and to give it to
[41:35.240 --> 41:38.280]  your friends your family your neighbors to get up on the soapbox at the end of
[41:38.280 --> 41:42.360]  the street if you need to we have been conditioned incrementally to just
[41:42.360 --> 41:46.920]  passively accept whatever happens and it is getting completely and totally out of
[41:46.920 --> 41:51.720]  control and they're not going to stop with these systems it would be better
[41:51.720 --> 41:57.200]  to strip search people so that the employees of TSA would have to see how
[41:57.200 --> 42:01.680]  dehumanizing this is and so people would consciously get the fact they're
[42:01.680 --> 42:05.080]  starting to understand it that they're being stripped searched and recorded they
[42:05.080 --> 42:08.960]  should make men women and children stripped down naked in front of video
[42:08.960 --> 42:12.960]  cameras because that's what's really happening but because there is this
[42:12.960 --> 42:23.000]  electronic buffer psychologically this electronic device the body scanner oh
[42:23.000 --> 42:27.520]  it's high-tech as if it makes it okay because a machine is doing it and a
[42:27.520 --> 42:32.640]  human is looking at it looking at your naked body look at this naked woman look
[42:32.640 --> 42:37.440]  at the naked man up on prison planet calm and info wars calm look at what the
[42:37.440 --> 42:42.440]  government's recording look at it
[42:47.800 --> 42:53.280]  the establishment is ensuring that pedophiles and perverts are kept
[42:53.280 --> 42:57.360]  entertained at airport security checkpoints by bandating that mass roll
[42:57.360 --> 43:00.780]  out of naked body scanners that provide detailed images of your child's in a
[43:00.780 --> 43:09.800]  tell you to be enjoyed by officials sitting alone in back rooms
[43:13.280 --> 43:18.120]  despite official assurances the media talking points that claim that naked
[43:18.120 --> 43:22.200]  body scanners now being implemented in airports worldwide do not show enough to
[43:22.200 --> 43:26.480]  tail to be considered a violation of privacy the true measure of how much of
[43:26.480 --> 43:30.000]  an intrusion they really are is proven by the fact that they break child
[43:30.000 --> 43:35.440]  pornography laws in the united kingdom that bar the production of internet
[43:35.440 --> 43:41.640]  images or indecent images of children ministers in the UK will be forced to
[43:41.640 --> 43:47.520]  exempt under 18s from the virtual strip searches or pass new legislation that
[43:47.520 --> 43:52.840]  protects airport workers from being prosecuted as pedophiles they also face
[43:52.840 --> 43:56.480]  demands from civil liberties groups for safeguards see that the fake civil
[43:56.480 --> 44:00.160]  liberties groups aren't calling for them to be banned aren't pointing out the top
[44:00.160 --> 44:05.720]  researchers say it wouldn't have found the the the the firecracker bomb they
[44:05.720 --> 44:09.920]  just say oh we want safeguards see how they control the debate we're even
[44:09.920 --> 44:13.440]  those supposedly against it that the media go to say well we don't want them
[44:13.440 --> 44:18.560]  to be saved or we want you to blur the face they also face demands from civil
[44:18.560 --> 44:25.800]  liberties groups for safeguards to ensure that images from the hundred and fifty
[44:25.800 --> 44:29.600]  thousand dollar a piece scanners including those of celebrities do not end up
[44:29.600 --> 44:32.800]  on the internet and you know they will the government is the main seller and
[44:32.800 --> 44:38.960]  leaker of social security numbers data personal info they share it through
[44:38.960 --> 44:41.960]  homeland security agreements with all these private corporations reports the
[44:41.960 --> 44:45.800]  guardian the department for transportation confirmed that the child porn
[44:45.800 --> 44:49.600]  problem was among the legal and operational issues now under discussion
[44:49.600 --> 44:53.760]  in whitehall after Gordon Brown's announcement on Sunday that he wanted
[44:53.760 --> 44:58.240]  to see gradual introduction at British airports that's a quote see gradual
[44:58.240 --> 45:04.360]  it's all about training the slave to accept folks Europe England Australia
[45:04.360 --> 45:09.000]  Canada the US they're all implementing and simultaneously they ordered them over
[45:09.000 --> 45:14.440]  a year ago they do not have the legal power to use full body scanners in this
[45:14.440 --> 45:18.800]  way said Terry Dowdy of action rights of children adding that there was an
[45:18.800 --> 45:25.720]  exemption in the 1978 law to cover the prevention and detection of crime but the
[45:25.720 --> 45:29.720]  purpose had to be more specific than the trawling exercises now being
[45:29.720 --> 45:37.040]  considered guilty until proven innocent as the Guardian report highlights
[45:37.040 --> 45:40.440]  despite the fact that news organizations routinely blur out sensitive areas of
[45:40.440 --> 45:44.160]  the body when showing images produced by the scans the actual resolution of the
[45:44.160 --> 45:49.400]  image allows airport workers to see genitals and breast enlargements of
[45:49.400 --> 45:55.200]  course look at the photos we have up its crystal clear you can see the physical
[45:55.200 --> 46:01.600]  characteristics of the vagina and the penis and all you shrinking violets out
[46:01.600 --> 46:04.480]  there that don't like to hear those words you need to go look at what they're
[46:04.480 --> 46:09.840]  recording of you I have been in airports watching people be scanned thank
[46:09.840 --> 46:17.120]  God they didn't single me out because I'm gonna say no despite the promise that
[46:17.120 --> 46:21.600]  the images would immediately be deleted a lie Simon Davies of Privacy
[46:21.600 --> 46:25.040]  International warrants the scans of celebrities or people with unusual or
[46:25.040 --> 46:29.160]  freakish body profiles would prove an irresistible pull for some employees
[46:29.160 --> 46:32.920]  who are constantly caught selling stuff already ladies and gentlemen see they're
[46:32.920 --> 46:36.960]  just debating how they do this and don't violate people's rights folks it's
[46:36.960 --> 46:43.480]  about getting you to submit to it they want you to know it's in your face she
[46:43.480 --> 46:46.080]  noticed they admit that they're recording them but oh they say well we're
[46:46.080 --> 46:51.360]  looking at maybe deleting them just like they wouldn't spy on you without warrants
[46:51.360 --> 46:55.560]  and now they spy on everybody indeed the fact that your sons and daughters will
[46:55.560 --> 46:59.280]  potentially be subject to a virtual strip search where the shape and detail of
[46:59.280 --> 47:03.680]  their genitals will be visible to someone sat sitting alone in a back room
[47:03.680 --> 47:08.880]  begs the question of what kind of people would want to apply for such a job if
[47:08.880 --> 47:12.920]  such technology is rolled out on a widespread basis working in airport
[47:12.920 --> 47:17.200]  security will undoubtedly become a pull for perverts and pedophiles who will be
[47:17.200 --> 47:22.440]  given free reign to lust over your naked child's body how far will Americans
[47:22.440 --> 47:26.440]  acquiesce in the name of safety
[47:26.440 --> 47:34.880]  if people will put up with this they will put up with anything in the article
[47:34.880 --> 47:38.360]  goes on with a lot more there and then has a video at the bottom of my analysis
[47:38.360 --> 47:45.400]  on this yesterday if they can get away with this they can get away with
[47:45.400 --> 47:49.040]  anything they're taking us a million miles and even if we push them back
[47:49.040 --> 47:56.120]  five hundred thousand they've won this must fail terrorism is a hoax just like
[47:56.120 --> 48:00.600]  man-made global warming is a hoax to take your rights the Club of Rome and the
[48:00.600 --> 48:04.680]  CFR have both written that they know it's all a fraud and a pretext to quote
[48:04.680 --> 48:17.000]  make humanity the enemy that the state will wage war against of course I told
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.160]  you two years ago that Chertoff owns a bunch of stock and consults for the two
[48:21.160 --> 48:25.520]  major body scanning company so does Ridge show to all of the major heads in
[48:25.520 --> 48:31.280]  England they all get massive paychecks off of this and they get up on TV and
[48:31.280 --> 48:38.000]  say we've got to have everyone go through these the Boston Globe Chertoff
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.360]  linked to body scanner manufacturer of course the Washington Post didn't tell
[48:43.360 --> 48:48.840]  anybody that when they report oh Chertoff calling for body scanners and
[48:48.840 --> 48:52.560]  there's a photo we're adding to Paul Watson's article at prisonplanet.com
[48:52.560 --> 48:57.600]  it'll be added to the info wars posting of it as well of the TSA worker with a
[48:57.600 --> 49:02.080]  beautiful young woman in the body scanner getting a 360 scan of her body
[49:02.080 --> 49:08.480]  while he looks at the video screen at her naked body we have the image of the
[49:08.480 --> 49:13.680]  naked scan and we have a young woman in the scanner there this photographs tell
[49:13.680 --> 49:17.600]  you a million words not a thousand words and again I will explain to you they
[49:17.600 --> 49:24.320]  are saving these this is a biometric scan of the dimensions of the body just
[49:24.320 --> 49:29.080]  like a thumbprint or the face or a handprint and they are creating biometric
[49:29.080 --> 49:33.920]  algorithms so that they can passively scan your body from a distance with a
[49:33.920 --> 49:37.840]  frontal or back or side view and know your identity and these systems have
[49:37.840 --> 49:43.360]  been going in I remember seven years ago reading in CBS news about passive MRI
[49:43.360 --> 49:53.680]  brain scanners in fact guys Google CBS news brain scanners go in airports and
[49:53.680 --> 49:57.000]  you will get the articles folks this they're not gonna stop there they're
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.280]  training you to go under medical exams they're training you to be frisk they're
[50:00.280 --> 50:03.240]  training you to be searched and notice it's oh everybody's gonna be questioned
[50:03.240 --> 50:07.320]  after 9-11 and then take your shoes off then take your belt off now untuck your
[50:07.320 --> 50:11.880]  shirt now answer questions take out all your electronics every time I fly they
[50:11.880 --> 50:15.240]  hold up the video cameras out of my bags and say what are these what what do you
[50:15.240 --> 50:21.960]  think they are it's about training you to be asked questions and now police all
[50:21.960 --> 50:25.440]  over the US randomly stop people and ask them questions and put it in their
[50:25.440 --> 50:29.400]  databases everything's being federalized
[50:29.400 --> 50:43.440]  again key articles right now ladies and gentlemen at prisonplanet.com

[52:14.960 --> 52:20.400]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[52:20.400 --> 52:25.640]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[52:25.640 --> 52:29.680]  attention fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the

[1:02:41.600 --> 1:02:45.440]  incrementally they say so you don't revolt they even talk about how they're
[1:02:45.440 --> 1:02:50.400]  managing you like animals using psychology on you
[1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:55.680]  it is just unbelievable has nothing to do with

[1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:02.480]  is the man that heads up what really happened dot com mike revero and
[1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:05.840]  obviously mike i want to talk about all the different facets of the body
[1:03:05.840 --> 1:03:10.000]  scanners first then we'll get into all the news on the economy
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:13.360]  as it implodes and all the numbers come out it's just devastating all about
[1:03:13.360 --> 1:03:16.240]  designed by the banks we're going to get into government
[1:03:16.240 --> 1:03:19.600]  takeover of health care big developments there as they plan to try to pass it in
[1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:23.040]  secret in conference that's u.s. news and world report
[1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:26.720]  mike revero does it make your blood boil to know that your wife your children
[1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:30.960]  your family will all be put in a database just like they've now
[1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:34.640]  declassified everyone 37 years they said their blood taken at birth and put in a
[1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:39.760]  dna database i mean this is a lawless criminal state mike revero
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:42.560]  well more than that is an indication that this is a government that is
[1:03:42.560 --> 1:03:45.760]  definitely afraid of its own population and you were mentioning earlier
[1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:49.120]  that they're trying to manage the public perception of these
[1:03:49.120 --> 1:03:53.360]  body scanners in order to avoid a revolt and that is clearly what they're afraid
[1:03:53.360 --> 1:03:56.240]  of they're not worried about airline bombers they're not worried about any
[1:03:56.240 --> 1:04:00.080]  of this stuff they are worried that as they push the american people
[1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:03.600]  further and further at some point there's going to be a revolt so all of this
[1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:07.120]  body scanning and all this database it is an attempt by the government to
[1:04:07.120 --> 1:04:10.560]  reassure itself that it is still in control of the population of the united
[1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:13.120]  states of america i think they may be spinning a
[1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:16.480]  self-destructive fantasy i think there's simply too much data for them to
[1:04:16.480 --> 1:04:20.400]  manage i mean this whole crotch bomber with his fruit of the boom underwear
[1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:24.400]  proves they've got the data they can't get anything meaningful out of it
[1:04:24.400 --> 1:04:26.880]  everybody's saying oh yes we knew he was out there
[1:04:26.880 --> 1:04:30.560]  there was indications this and all this now there's a a fight between great
[1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:33.280]  britain and the united states over who had the information and
[1:04:33.280 --> 1:04:36.960]  who dropped the ball and basically they're drowning in the wealth of all of
[1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:40.880]  this data now i don't like being put in databases i don't like being scanned
[1:04:40.880 --> 1:04:44.880]  but i think the bottom line is they're collecting so much data on everybody
[1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:48.640]  they can't manage it they've got a huge might stay there well clearly they
[1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:51.760]  staged the event to begin with to simultaneously launch their new war
[1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:54.720]  against yemen and as well as north africa

[1:08:10.800 --> 1:08:14.480]  now remember general aviation people that own their own Cessna
[1:08:14.480 --> 1:08:17.040]  or people that charter jets they don't have to go through
[1:08:17.040 --> 1:08:21.600]  the body scanners they don't have to take their shoes off pull their shirts out
[1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:24.800]  go through these acts of submission and notice how it's ratcheted up
[1:08:24.800 --> 1:08:29.600]  incrementally the government admits they're doing this to train you
[1:08:29.600 --> 1:08:33.760]  and if they can get you to put up with this then they believe you'll go along
[1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:37.920]  with literally anything in the last hour today i'm going to break down the
[1:08:37.920 --> 1:08:40.800]  legal leaves of all this it is not a privilege to fly
[1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:44.240]  it is not a privilege to drive it is not a privilege to travel
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:48.320]  it is not a privilege to own a gun it is not a privilege to own property
[1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:52.160]  but all of these basic rights are being abridged and eroded and basically
[1:08:52.160 --> 1:08:56.080]  abolished okay it is not a privilege they
[1:08:56.080 --> 1:08:59.280]  tell you it's a privilege it's not a privilege
[1:08:59.280 --> 1:09:02.720]  they're doing this through color of law private airports
[1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:05.920]  but they're not they're used taxpayer money could do this
[1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:10.160]  private aircraft companies could do this that ferry people
[1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:14.880]  and goods but they're using government to order it in front of their private
[1:09:14.880 --> 1:09:18.800]  operation in agreements it's a fraud and it has nothing to do with keeping you
[1:09:18.800 --> 1:09:23.360]  safe micro vero joins us with this once a month visit from hawaii
[1:09:23.360 --> 1:09:26.960]  streaming video not just audio at prisonplanet.tv might
[1:09:26.960 --> 1:09:30.560]  continuing with the fact that they want to break our spirits they want to break
[1:09:30.560 --> 1:09:34.400]  our back they want us to capitulate to this outrageous
[1:09:34.400 --> 1:09:37.280]  letting us know our naked bodies are being recorded on screen i'm going to
[1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:41.040]  put images of the body scans of what they really show
[1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:44.720]  and you can even blow these photos up right down to the
[1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:51.680]  pores on women's mammary glands right down to the smallest detail of their
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:55.200]  genitalia they are in the u.s putting children through
[1:09:55.200 --> 1:09:57.600]  these they are recording it they are saving it
[1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:01.760]  i mean this is outrageous and i'll talk later about what comes next
[1:10:01.760 --> 1:10:05.440]  and also what your idea is mike on how we boycott this how we fight it
[1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:08.320]  then we'll get into the latest hype to attack yemen
[1:10:08.320 --> 1:10:12.000]  happening right before the underwear bomber the latest hype for scanners
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:14.960]  coming out within minutes of the underwear bomber on christmas day
[1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:18.080]  clearly all of this is concerted for the rollout
[1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:21.520]  of the next level the tightening of the control grid noose
[1:10:21.520 --> 1:10:25.200]  around our next mike revero you're absolutely correct and this has got
[1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:28.000]  nothing to do with security because as you know
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:32.480]  the amsterdam airport already had these full body scanners now we've gotten
[1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:36.160]  two stories from this crotch bomber the first one they said he went through
[1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:40.000]  the scanner but he hid the explosive behind his testicles
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:43.840]  and then every said well that proves the body scanners don't work so then they
[1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:46.960]  changed the story and said oh well he was allowed to get on board the plane
[1:10:46.960 --> 1:10:49.840]  without going through the scanner so they're still trying to tell you that
[1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:53.600]  these scanners are going to help but the bottom line is that all of the security
[1:10:53.600 --> 1:10:57.920]  uh... is is a waste of time and money if the people running it just let anybody
[1:10:57.920 --> 1:11:01.040]  on the plane we know the sky was allowed on the plane without a passport
[1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:04.720]  there was an intervention we know that security at the amsterdam airport is
[1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:08.400]  run by the same company that ran security at all the nine eleven airports
[1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:11.920]  we know that the shoe bomber went through amsterdam airport
[1:11:11.920 --> 1:11:16.240]  he got past security it's all a big joke and a big
[1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:20.160]  scam again there the goal is to make money selling these scanners
[1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:23.840]  the goal is to uh... condition the american people into thinking they have
[1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:26.480]  no right of privacy whatsoever
[1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:29.120]  uh... that they can the government can look at your naked body whenever they
[1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:30.080]  feel like it
[1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:33.360]  the next step will be making us fly naked on the airplane and saying you can't
[1:11:33.360 --> 1:11:36.400]  use the restroom they're talking about the shock bracelets
[1:11:36.400 --> 1:11:40.080]  it's completely out of control by the way my they're already saying in the last
[1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:42.960]  hour keep your hands in your lap but nothing on your lap
[1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:47.120]  no electronics period on any flight they are literally training us to be
[1:11:47.120 --> 1:11:49.360]  prisoners and i'm showing that photos
[1:11:49.360 --> 1:11:52.320]  on prison planet dot tv right now for tv viewers
[1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:56.000]  radio listeners can go read the articles at prison planet dot com and see them
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:00.560]  where it shows the woman completely naked men completely naked their genitalia
[1:12:00.560 --> 1:12:05.680]  hanging uh... it shows it all and then we show another photo of the tsa with a
[1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:10.080]  woman in the scanner as the man looks at another woman's naked body
[1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:13.840]  on the screen with a smile on his face
[1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:18.080]  well it's definitely it's a it's a complete uh... it's almost dehumanizing
[1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:20.880]  the american people where almost it is
[1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:24.160]  we're being turned into objects were run through the scanners were set off to
[1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:26.160]  war were sent off to the tax farms
[1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:30.080]  we you know we're being objectified in a in a way that you know of men's
[1:12:30.080 --> 1:12:32.960]  magazines never even dreamt of doing
[1:12:32.960 --> 1:12:35.920]  uh... to people now you want to know how we're gonna stop this thing i think
[1:12:35.920 --> 1:12:39.120]  it's going to destroy itself because we're already seeing
[1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:43.280]  that tourism in the united states has has just absolutely plummeted we're dying
[1:12:43.280 --> 1:12:44.720]  out here in hawaii
[1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:48.240]  california's on the verge of bankruptcy and their loss of tourism is a big
[1:12:48.240 --> 1:12:48.880]  part of it
[1:12:48.880 --> 1:12:51.680]  the way that we stop this is we stop using the airlines
[1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:55.680]  we stop traveling uh... it you know what we travel only i agree with you
[1:12:55.680 --> 1:12:59.440]  mike but i don't have a lot of business but it but but at a higher level
[1:12:59.440 --> 1:13:02.960]  that's what morris strong in the unit met they want to shut down air travel
[1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:05.920]  they want an international tax on travel but but
[1:13:05.920 --> 1:13:10.000]  go back i mean you're right i've seen the statistics in since nine eleven
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:13.600]  it's not happening in the rest of the world people aren't coming to america
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:15.920]  because people that come from freer countries
[1:13:15.920 --> 1:13:19.280]  no this is a police state i talked to russians that come here
[1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:21.440]  and they can't believe what a police state they say
[1:13:21.440 --> 1:13:24.720]  when i was a little kid in russia it was like this
[1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:28.240]  yeah very much we have become the evil empire here we had some very good
[1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:31.200]  friends who lived in great britain they would come out here to hawaii once a
[1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:31.680]  year
[1:13:31.680 --> 1:13:34.800]  they stopped years ago and they said we can't relax in hawaii
[1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:38.080]  when we're treated like p o w's everywhere we go with the airport
[1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:41.440]  and they're absolutely correct it's completely out of control i've offered
[1:13:41.440 --> 1:13:45.280]  to fly the watson's here the watson's i've flown to england to meet them they
[1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:46.720]  flown here before
[1:13:46.720 --> 1:13:50.400]  i've offered it's been four years since they were here to fly
[1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:51.360]  uh...
[1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:55.920]  steve watson and paul watson to the u s and they don't even want to come
[1:13:55.920 --> 1:13:59.360]  but they're living in a police state there as well
[1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:02.800]  it's it's just absolutely amazing and the thing is we're going to destroy our
[1:14:02.800 --> 1:14:03.920]  airline industry
[1:14:03.920 --> 1:14:06.080]  we're going to destroy our tourism industry
[1:14:06.080 --> 1:14:10.240]  what is this government thinking that they're so eager to just put profits in
[1:14:10.240 --> 1:14:13.200]  the pockets of their cronies that they're willing to completely destroy
[1:14:13.200 --> 1:14:18.000]  what little remains of the private uh... economy in the united states
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.160]  well it's incredible uh...
[1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:24.480]  microbarrow as the public goes online of the security company's own sites and
[1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:26.000]  actually sees
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:28.960]  the the three sixty naked image
[1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:32.120]  and as the public learns that the feds are already proposing
[1:14:32.120 --> 1:14:34.720]  for people that might actually hide bombs
[1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:36.400]  in their stomachs or drugs
[1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:40.200]  they're talking about high-powered in our eyes and we just printed in fact
[1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:41.040]  bring it into me
[1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:44.640]  the cbs news stories where they had met
[1:14:44.640 --> 1:14:48.800]  that these m r i's are cancer-causing these are high-powered
[1:14:48.800 --> 1:14:51.960]  these firewaves into your body
[1:14:51.960 --> 1:14:56.280]  well even the full body scanners it's now now being discovered they are able to
[1:14:56.280 --> 1:14:57.760]  damage dna
[1:14:57.760 --> 1:15:01.360]  now they're not powerful enough to break more molecules completely apart
[1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:04.360]  but that center of the dna helix is
[1:15:04.360 --> 1:15:08.160]  intentionally weak because it has to unzip in order to replicate the dna
[1:15:08.160 --> 1:15:09.520]  during cell division
[1:15:09.520 --> 1:15:12.600]  and so it's a very very delicate chemical bond and they're discovering
[1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:15.400]  that these terrohertz waves in these full body scanners
[1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:18.520]  are ripping these dna strands apart your body so they're
[1:15:18.520 --> 1:15:21.920]  they're sort of flopping loose and that means the enzymes that have to travel
[1:15:21.920 --> 1:15:23.040]  down the dna
[1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:25.720]  to copy off protein manufacturing instructions
[1:15:25.720 --> 1:15:29.320]  they're getting bad information and that's made a lot of universities in
[1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:33.560]  europe china the u.s. are finding this here's another article cbs news
[1:15:33.560 --> 1:15:38.520]  new focus on dangers of ct scans they know it's hurting people
[1:15:38.520 --> 1:15:42.040]  and they're going to start just zapping everybody at every airport with these
[1:15:42.040 --> 1:15:42.560]  things
[1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:45.680]  we're gonna wait about four or five years and it's going to be an explosive
[1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:47.360]  epidemic of skin cancers
[1:15:47.360 --> 1:15:50.360]  and all these other problems and the government won't care because they've
[1:15:50.360 --> 1:15:51.360]  made their money
[1:15:51.360 --> 1:15:53.520]  they've sold us another pig in a poke
[1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:56.440]  you know they weren't able to sell us a global carbon tax they weren't able to
[1:15:56.440 --> 1:15:57.520]  sell us vaccines
[1:15:57.520 --> 1:16:00.360]  they're gonna sell us these security machines don't care what they sell us
[1:16:00.360 --> 1:16:03.560]  as long as they're getting their money and they don't care what damage it does
[1:16:03.560 --> 1:16:04.120]  to us
[1:16:04.120 --> 1:16:05.400]  as long as they get their money
[1:16:05.400 --> 1:16:07.920]  and it's such the president and get away with any remember in the forty
[1:16:07.920 --> 1:16:09.880]  fifty sixties and seventies
[1:16:09.880 --> 1:16:14.040]  radiation test on foster children other millimeter wave test
[1:16:14.040 --> 1:16:17.760]  they've they've done all this already to troops and foster children they know
[1:16:17.760 --> 1:16:19.080]  what it does
[1:16:19.080 --> 1:16:22.600]  they absolutely do and they've shown a complete disregard for the victims of
[1:16:22.600 --> 1:16:24.400]  these experiments in these systems
[1:16:24.400 --> 1:16:29.440]  the goal is to make money and to establish their agenda and the the
[1:16:29.440 --> 1:16:33.560]  personal harm to individual citizens is just considered a cost of achieving
[1:16:33.560 --> 1:16:36.920]  uh... the goal were were be were were objects they don't care what happens to
[1:16:36.920 --> 1:16:40.200]  us they don't care if we're getting sick look at all the food and i love it
[1:16:40.200 --> 1:16:42.960]  and i love it in fact stop right there you bring up food additives
[1:16:42.960 --> 1:16:45.840]  i ordered a pizza a few weeks ago for the guys up here late night working on a
[1:16:45.840 --> 1:16:46.560]  film
[1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:48.440]  papa john's i
[1:16:48.440 --> 1:16:51.320]  uh... rip open the package of pepper
[1:16:51.320 --> 1:16:55.880]  dump it on my pizza and then read crushed peppers treated with radiation
[1:16:55.880 --> 1:17:00.840]  which again a hundred percent inclusive at bare minimum it kills the food value
[1:17:00.840 --> 1:17:01.400]  of it
[1:17:01.400 --> 1:17:05.920]  and in every major study in lab animals causes all sorts of illnesses and now
[1:17:05.920 --> 1:17:06.760]  literally
[1:17:06.760 --> 1:17:10.240]  crone's disease didn't exist autoimmune disease of the intestines
[1:17:10.240 --> 1:17:12.000]  fifty years ago now
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:15.320]  i've got two people in my office with crone's disease
[1:17:15.320 --> 1:17:18.720]  i got an employee who's out today because his mother
[1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:22.240]  is in great danger of dying from crone's
[1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:25.760]  yeah it's it's amazing we know that there's a uh... link between
[1:17:25.760 --> 1:17:29.480]  uh... vaccines and autism we are we know that there's all kinds of these
[1:17:29.480 --> 1:17:32.640]  problems between food additives on my mother my uh... my wife went through
[1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:34.760]  that with joint pain and formaldehyde
[1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:36.840]  and the and we're just finding out now
[1:17:36.840 --> 1:17:40.560]  that twenty percent of the eighty four thousand chemicals in common commercial
[1:17:40.560 --> 1:17:41.840]  usage in the united states
[1:17:41.840 --> 1:17:43.240]  are kept secret
[1:17:43.240 --> 1:17:46.640]  because they're treated as proprietary secrets of the company nobody knows
[1:17:46.640 --> 1:17:50.080]  what is in these products nobody knows if they've ever been tested for safety
[1:17:50.080 --> 1:17:51.240]  and toxicity
[1:17:51.240 --> 1:17:54.280]  uh... there's a little that's why it says that's why it says
[1:17:54.280 --> 1:17:59.200]  uh... natural and unnatural flavors or artificial flavors
[1:17:59.200 --> 1:18:04.040]  is and that's now declassified eighteen thousand five hundred chemicals plus
[1:18:04.040 --> 1:18:05.200]  that are secret
[1:18:05.200 --> 1:18:09.040]  and these big companies are eugenicists they're doing it on purpose mike
[1:18:09.040 --> 1:18:10.880]  that's why the public so passive
[1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:14.520]  can you imagine a hundred years ago they tried to put naked body scanners in
[1:18:14.520 --> 1:18:16.360]  no one would put up with that
[1:18:16.360 --> 1:18:19.720]  yet it is a mystery to me i was expecting the american people to start
[1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:22.400]  really getting angry even back during the exposure
[1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:24.960]  of climate gate when it became unavoidable
[1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:27.880]  that government and media and academic institutions
[1:18:27.880 --> 1:18:30.160]  we're all working together to sell us
[1:18:30.160 --> 1:18:32.440]  this hoax of human cause global warming
[1:18:32.440 --> 1:18:35.120]  to impose a global carbon tax in a global government
[1:18:35.120 --> 1:18:39.000]  now we're in the middle of one of the harshest winters in the last sixty years
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:42.320]  and the global warming cultists are still out there saying oh no global warming
[1:18:42.320 --> 1:18:43.760]  causes cold weather
[1:18:43.760 --> 1:18:46.200]  this is all evidence of our agenda is correct
[1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:49.040]  they you know they're standing there with their hairs on fire and telling us
[1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:50.960]  they don't smell any smoke
[1:18:50.960 --> 1:18:53.000]  and they're caught red-handed
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:56.200]  or blue-handed in this case
[1:18:56.200 --> 1:18:58.680]  absolutely mike again we have another story

[1:19:22.040 --> 1:19:25.480]  and where they put any food additives to sterilize they want the food and we're
[1:19:25.480 --> 1:19:28.280]  mainstream tv calls for putting lithium
[1:19:28.280 --> 1:19:31.720]  anti-psychotics in the water and where the public just takes it
[1:19:31.720 --> 1:19:33.560]  people would laugh at that and say
[1:19:33.560 --> 1:19:37.440]  that movies unbelievable nobody would ever put up with that

[1:24:53.680 --> 1:24:57.080]  got to scare people you've got a bankrupt people you've got to pose as their
[1:24:57.080 --> 1:25:00.680]  savior you've got to get your grit in place Mike Rivera what really happened
[1:25:00.680 --> 1:25:06.520]  dot com joins us Mike continuing finishing up in this segment with the
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:11.920]  naked body scanners admittedly causing DNA damage recording your naked children
[1:25:11.920 --> 1:25:17.240]  your wife your husband again acts of submission making a submit now in
[1:25:17.240 --> 1:25:22.320]  England they've put random body scanners and vans driving around Pat they go to
[1:25:22.320 --> 1:25:26.280]  bars make people walk through them guilty until proven innocent TSA says
[1:25:26.280 --> 1:25:29.560]  everything that goes on in airports will now go on the streets of America they
[1:25:29.560 --> 1:25:35.120]  said that seven years ago that's now rolling out with random searches in LA
[1:25:35.120 --> 1:25:39.840]  in New York in Boston on New Year's with the police out randomly searching people
[1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:44.760]  this is hellish Mike this is our way of life being totally overturned because of
[1:25:44.760 --> 1:25:49.800]  some underwear bomber it's a total fraud it is absolutely a total fraud one
[1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:54.240]  little aspect to the case I'm starting to look into right now supposedly he at
[1:25:54.240 --> 1:25:57.040]  whatever happened on that airplane whether it was an exploding laptop
[1:25:57.040 --> 1:26:00.600]  battery or was really you know he's sitting on his own bomb which makes no
[1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:04.560]  sense whatsoever I mean if you really think about it if he had really wanted
[1:26:04.560 --> 1:26:08.400]  to blow up the plane he would have gone to the laboratory where he had some
[1:26:08.400 --> 1:26:12.360]  privacy you know start digging around in his crotch put it against the wall the
[1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:17.400]  plane and set it up he did what he did in the cabin so that he would be seen he
[1:26:17.400 --> 1:26:22.040]  was there to create a media incident same thing with the shoe bomber doing
[1:26:22.040 --> 1:26:25.560]  what he did on the airplane they could have gone to the laboratory and
[1:26:25.560 --> 1:26:28.960]  accomplished whatever they were doing there if their goal was to really bring
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:32.480]  down the airplane as opposed to being another hoax but here's another
[1:26:32.480 --> 1:26:37.720]  circumstance about this situation I've been looking back at all the incidents
[1:26:37.720 --> 1:26:42.880]  where people have died in the airports because of being tasered by TSA we had a
[1:26:42.880 --> 1:26:48.920]  very tragic situation here at the Honolulu airport where a family coming in
[1:26:48.920 --> 1:26:53.800]  from another island because they needed to bring their child to to the airport
[1:26:53.800 --> 1:26:58.240]  they came in from Samoa and nobody at the TSA could speak Samoan so they locked
[1:26:58.240 --> 1:27:02.400]  this family in a room while they try and find a translator and the baby died
[1:27:02.400 --> 1:27:05.840]  before they were allowed out and I'm thinking about it more people are dying
[1:27:05.840 --> 1:27:10.640]  from TSA than they are from these crotch and shoe bombers and nobody seems to
[1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:14.680]  really be all that upset about it if the goal is to keep Americans safe who's
[1:27:14.680 --> 1:27:19.400]  keeping us safe from all these these fast food restaurant reject rejects we're
[1:27:19.400 --> 1:27:23.760]  given a taser in a uniform and rubber gloves and said go have fun at the
[1:27:23.760 --> 1:27:29.720]  airports yeah it's an army of fast food minions now I want to be clear when I
[1:27:29.720 --> 1:27:33.800]  flown in LA when I've flown in Austin and other cities almost every time I
[1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:37.880]  fly now they go sh hey Alex I like your show a lot of us are awake we know what's
[1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:42.480]  going on it's just a job that has happened over and over again so a lot of
[1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:45.240]  these are former military or their people that have lost their job or their
[1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:49.800]  people that worked at the post office but there are a lot of menial thug types
[1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:52.880]  and how many reports have we seen where they make women drink their own breast
[1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:57.560]  milk to prove it's not a liquid bomb how many cases have we seen where they
[1:27:57.560 --> 1:28:01.720]  arrest people for knitting needles or for a tiny pocket knife I had him yelling
[1:28:01.720 --> 1:28:08.880]  screaming me in Billings Montana flying out from the hardened situation because
[1:28:08.880 --> 1:28:13.080]  I said oh I'll just take this tiny bottle of free shampoo at the hotel and I went
[1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:16.120]  I said lady I said it's actually on the wall that that's legal and she said okay
[1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:21.280]  whatever just get through here so again it's training us to be abused that we're
[1:28:21.280 --> 1:28:26.520]  criminals that's what a tyranny is it makes law abiding people criminals well
[1:28:26.520 --> 1:28:29.960]  there have been a lot of experiments that show that when people are given a
[1:28:29.960 --> 1:28:34.120]  little bit of authority they can become real monsters their dark side comes out
[1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:36.920]  and we're seeing that in all of our airports and you're asking what are we
[1:28:36.920 --> 1:28:41.360]  going to do about this on the lighter side I'm trying to find a radio opaque
[1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:44.960]  ink that we can put on t-shirts so there's a message that only shows up in
[1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:49.240]  the scanners that says things like pervert or I told you my dick was bigger
[1:28:49.240 --> 1:28:54.200]  than your dick and a family audience let's be careful sorry sorry about that
[1:28:54.200 --> 1:28:58.600]  sorry about that but no seriously we can either do it humorously but in the
[1:28:58.600 --> 1:29:04.600]  long run I think that we're going to see the airlines just start going out of
[1:29:04.600 --> 1:29:07.520]  business because people are not going to want to travel and maybe that's
[1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:11.160]  somebody's big agenda but I think the owners and stockholders in the airline
[1:29:11.160 --> 1:29:14.520]  companies are going to realize they're taking in the teeth as much as the
[1:29:14.520 --> 1:29:18.760]  tourism industry is from all of this abusive behavior at the airport and as
[1:29:18.760 --> 1:29:23.920]  more and more people realize it is just a hoax to try and train us into accepting
[1:29:23.920 --> 1:29:27.520]  that we have no more privacy whatsoever and they'll begin to understand that what
[1:29:27.520 --> 1:29:30.920]  the government is really worried about is a revolution in this country and as
[1:29:30.920 --> 1:29:34.400]  long as they can keep a strip naked and they can read our emails and listen to
[1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:38.640]  our phone calls that we can't plan and organize to do anything they're trying

[1:34:48.920 --> 1:34:52.920]  we're talking with Mike Rivera Mike anything else you want to add about the
[1:34:52.920 --> 1:34:57.480]  naked-body scanners and what's happening with this and how to boycott it then I
[1:34:57.480 --> 1:35:00.600]  want to get into the economy government-run health care and a lot more
[1:35:00.600 --> 1:35:04.680]  with you today Mike Rivera. Well I think people are gonna boycott these scanners
[1:35:04.680 --> 1:35:07.560]  anyway I mean the media is trying to tell us it's no big deal but there's a
[1:35:07.560 --> 1:35:11.880]  lot of very shy people out there who don't like this kind of intrusion they
[1:35:11.880 --> 1:35:16.640]  don't look like. I don't want the government video taping my genitals. No
[1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:19.640]  well that's exactly my point I think people are gonna reject this thing
[1:35:19.640 --> 1:35:22.920]  they're going to avoid going to the airport we don't all look like that
[1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:26.280]  very attractive young lady that's on that story on your website and we're
[1:35:26.280 --> 1:35:30.440]  we and we're like you we don't want the government looking at our body it's
[1:35:30.440 --> 1:35:33.640]  none of their business if we have not done anything wrong I think this is
[1:35:33.640 --> 1:35:37.400]  gonna be a disaster for air travel it's already a disaster for tourism I think
[1:35:37.400 --> 1:35:41.120]  we're gonna see another segment of our economy come crashing down all to make
[1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:45.480]  another few political insiders. Shouldn't there be a criminal investigation of
[1:35:45.480 --> 1:35:48.920]  Chertoff and other government officials that are making money off this in the
[1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:52.520]  revolving door the fact that they're out there pushing it when they're making
[1:35:52.520 --> 1:35:55.680]  money from it? There should be an investigation there should be a
[1:35:55.680 --> 1:35:58.640]  prosecution in a trial I don't think we're gonna see it under this particular
[1:35:58.640 --> 1:36:02.600]  government somewhere down the road we got to look at war crime trials against
[1:36:02.600 --> 1:36:06.920]  the last couple of presidents that we've had for all this lying about Iraq you
[1:36:06.920 --> 1:36:09.960]  know they're talking about taking. They've been caught lying three times in the last
[1:36:09.960 --> 1:36:13.840]  month about Iran with fake nuke documents I mean all they've done is change the
[1:36:13.840 --> 1:36:20.280]  last letter in Iraq to Iran they've changed it from a Q to an N. Yeah and
[1:36:20.280 --> 1:36:23.680]  you know what's really insulting they actually think we the American people
[1:36:23.680 --> 1:36:28.120]  are going to be dumb enough to fall for the same trick twice in a row and it's
[1:36:28.120 --> 1:36:31.640]  you know it's almost an arrogant insult they're sitting up there and they're in
[1:36:31.640 --> 1:36:35.120]  their ivory towers in control of the corporate media and they're saying we
[1:36:35.120 --> 1:36:39.200]  can play the same card again and they're too afraid to stand up and say you know
[1:36:39.200 --> 1:36:42.680]  that we know you're lying this time they're really counting on that but on
[1:36:42.680 --> 1:36:45.960]  the other hand I really think that all of this security scanner and naked body
[1:36:45.960 --> 1:36:49.240]  scanners and the rest of it they're not afraid of some terrorists coming in
[1:36:49.240 --> 1:36:53.360]  wearing fruit of the boom underwear they're afraid of we the American people
[1:36:53.360 --> 1:36:57.200]  this is the symptom I'm seeing this is a government that is deathly afraid of
[1:36:57.200 --> 1:37:02.280]  the American people even as it continues to need us to provide tax dollars and
[1:37:02.280 --> 1:37:07.920]  soldiers for their globalist agenda. I agree I want to go to calls now quickly
[1:37:07.920 --> 1:37:12.040]  with each caller then I want to get into by the way here's that MSNBC article
[1:37:12.040 --> 1:37:18.360]  you mentioned baby detained dies in Honolulu Airport child have been flown
[1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:22.480]  in for emergency heart surgery officials say and all the stories of somebody
[1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:26.160]  who can't speak English or argues with them they taser them to death or they
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:31.320]  stomp on their head till their neck breaks and I mean the government is the
[1:37:31.320 --> 1:37:35.280]  threat to the people government killed 200 million people in the last century
[1:37:35.280 --> 1:37:41.560]  the threat is not underwear bombers and that's staged as well but before we go
[1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:46.320]  to calls briefly you know Tarpley Madsen myself everybody who's looked at
[1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:51.520]  this this is clearly a false flag drill they conducted you've got the sharp
[1:37:51.520 --> 1:37:55.720]  dress man bringing him on the plane in Amsterdam with no passport past the
[1:37:55.720 --> 1:38:00.040]  body scanners great point you made about that you've got some other man
[1:38:00.040 --> 1:38:03.280]  reportedly with a bomb once they got to Detroit they covered that up they've
[1:38:03.280 --> 1:38:06.600]  now admitted they covered it up but won't say why you've got the fact that
[1:38:06.600 --> 1:38:09.520]  this happened right as they introduced the scanners right as they introduced
[1:38:09.520 --> 1:38:12.560]  Yemen is the new enemy your take briefly on that
[1:38:12.560 --> 1:38:15.880]  yeah absolutely we've been in Yemen covertly for about a year
[1:38:15.880 --> 1:38:19.960]  we've started actually actively bombing their uh... two three weeks ago
[1:38:19.960 --> 1:38:24.120]  then all of a sudden right when obama needs it to justify making the war in
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:24.720]  Yemen
[1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:28.880]  overt we get the stage terror incident it's the same
[1:38:28.880 --> 1:38:32.720]  stunt all over again in its its its obvious what he's doing
[1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:35.920]  i think most americans understand that this is another hoax i think most
[1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:36.680]  americans
[1:38:36.680 --> 1:38:40.960]  don't believe that this is authentically an attempted terror attack
[1:38:40.960 --> 1:38:43.880]  well i agree with you that the establishment is better not more than
[1:38:43.880 --> 1:38:45.840]  they can shoot but they don't care
[1:38:45.840 --> 1:38:48.720]  they don't care for against open borders they don't care if we don't want more
[1:38:48.720 --> 1:38:52.160]  gun control they don't care we don't want the banks to loot us and rob us they
[1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:55.160]  don't care they just do it
[1:38:55.160 --> 1:38:58.440]  they do it because it's making the money it's getting the more power they're
[1:38:58.440 --> 1:39:02.400]  thinking very very short term i think most of the insiders understand it's
[1:39:02.400 --> 1:39:06.160]  not going to go on much longer so they're doing whatever they can do to suck as
[1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:09.520]  much money out of the population and put it in their pocket before the ski
[1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:10.960]  dattle down to the caiman's
[1:39:10.960 --> 1:39:14.560]  as everything starts to fall apart i think we're seeing almost an economic
[1:39:14.560 --> 1:39:17.840]  bug out they're grabbing the money and the silverware and they're heading for
[1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:21.320]  the border i think we're in that loot the nation phase right now well there's no
[1:39:21.320 --> 1:39:24.680]  doubt of that leaving a vanguard rearguard of of
[1:39:24.680 --> 1:39:26.360]  paramilitary police
[1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:27.920]  to run around and feed on us
[1:39:27.920 --> 1:39:32.280]  uh... let's talk to andy in california andy you're on the air
[1:39:32.280 --> 1:39:36.240]  hello this is india in california and i just want to talk to you about the american
[1:39:36.240 --> 1:39:39.800]  disabilities act in the lack of access for people with dyslexia
[1:39:39.800 --> 1:39:42.400]  an attention deficit disorder and just by us
[1:39:42.400 --> 1:39:45.200]  uh... using our auxiliary aid of the tape recorder
[1:39:45.200 --> 1:39:48.280]  it makes us an enemy of the county state and federal government
[1:39:48.280 --> 1:39:51.000]  because it returns a quarter record people
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  and that's right the government tries to say people can't record government
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:58.920]  but then they can all record and surveil us they get rid of our basic rights
[1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:00.000]  criminally
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:02.800]  and then declare unconstitutional powers for themselves andy i appreciate your
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:03.880]  call we're not on the
[1:40:03.880 --> 1:40:05.200]  disabilities act i mean i

[1:40:46.480 --> 1:40:48.420]  so i just want to put that out to you
[1:40:48.420 --> 1:40:49.840]  thank you for waking me up
[1:40:49.840 --> 1:40:54.040]  i am outkeeper and i'm here in northern california trying to spread the word
[1:40:54.040 --> 1:40:55.080]  thank you my man
[1:40:55.080 --> 1:40:58.520]  great lot of police officers military becoming outkeepers
[1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:00.120]  and three percenters
[1:41:00.120 --> 1:41:04.040]  uh... and again i'm not bashing gay people the point i'm making is
[1:41:04.040 --> 1:41:08.920]  bohemian grove is where your main line christian conservative leaders go on
[1:41:08.920 --> 1:41:10.080]  record
[1:41:10.080 --> 1:41:13.400]  to have top gay porn stars flown in to have drug
[1:41:13.400 --> 1:41:18.760]  induced orgies and it's on record again it's a group of lawless lunatics who
[1:41:18.760 --> 1:41:21.000]  now want to record your children
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:24.360]  and remember they they told us torture was good i want to make that point for
[1:41:24.360 --> 1:41:26.400]  the last hour i go over it
[1:41:26.400 --> 1:41:30.360]  that that that tortures good and jack bowers our hero
[1:41:30.360 --> 1:41:34.080]  and and then now video taping body scanning your children is good and
[1:41:34.080 --> 1:41:37.880]  remember the white house reviewed the torture videos in photo so did congress
[1:41:37.880 --> 1:41:38.960]  but didn't release them
[1:41:38.960 --> 1:41:42.400]  i'm sure they enjoyed that uh... micro vero
[1:41:42.400 --> 1:41:46.200]  well did you see wayne madson's new report on russia today where they're
[1:41:46.200 --> 1:41:47.360]  they're talking about
[1:41:47.360 --> 1:41:51.320]  uh... u s diplomats and congressman going on these fact-finding
[1:41:51.320 --> 1:41:53.320]  uh... missions to thailand
[1:41:53.320 --> 1:41:56.440]  and they're engaging in child sex over there and it's it's just
[1:41:56.440 --> 1:41:58.680]  completely out of control and normally i would
[1:41:58.680 --> 1:42:00.440]  hold off on a story like that
[1:42:00.440 --> 1:42:03.720]  but i remember i was living in seattle when there was this huge scandal over
[1:42:03.720 --> 1:42:06.000]  the asia pacific economic conference
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:09.360]  where the fb i was bugging the conference attendees stealing business
[1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:13.160]  secrets to get to cronies and there were children underage children being
[1:42:13.160 --> 1:42:15.360]  provided to some of the conference attendees
[1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:19.360]  for sexual purposes and it turned out there was actually a fund at the state
[1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:20.160]  department
[1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:21.440]  for this kind of stuff
[1:42:21.440 --> 1:42:25.080]  and uh... you know so it's like this we've got this one set of rules that
[1:42:25.080 --> 1:42:26.800]  we're all supposed to live by
[1:42:26.800 --> 1:42:31.080]  and you know think about the franklin scandal hey kate gunterson in the late
[1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:32.760]  eighties on record
[1:42:32.760 --> 1:42:37.680]  it ran the l a uh... uh... uh... division of the fb i and this i have the
[1:42:37.680 --> 1:42:40.360]  washington post articles the washington times articles
[1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:43.920]  they had this place called the finders run by the cia
[1:42:43.920 --> 1:42:45.440]  and when the police rated it
[1:42:45.440 --> 1:42:49.760]  it was satellite uplinks child porn they just got the kids out and the
[1:42:49.760 --> 1:42:53.040]  government shut that investigation down i mean these people
[1:42:53.040 --> 1:42:55.840]  are the most sinister murdering criminals
[1:42:55.840 --> 1:42:59.040]  look at how the halibut dine core the u n of all the caught
[1:42:59.040 --> 1:43:02.640]  running giant child kidnapping operations and now they have expanded
[1:43:02.640 --> 1:43:06.440]  diplomatic immunity through inner poll in the u s and so
[1:43:06.440 --> 1:43:10.040]  the justice department just went under inner poll so all their records are
[1:43:10.040 --> 1:43:13.720]  secret and they have diplomatic immunity and how many times is the u n
[1:43:13.720 --> 1:43:17.360]  been caught under diplomatic immunity trafficking in children
[1:43:17.360 --> 1:43:20.640]  it's a it really is completely out of control it just seems like
[1:43:20.640 --> 1:43:25.040]  the wrong side of all the scanners they just drive right on the airports
[1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:28.440]  yeah they do they got their own jets they've got all their private airplanes
[1:43:28.440 --> 1:43:29.200]  they've got the
[1:43:29.200 --> 1:43:32.000]  uh... the private terminals that they go through they don't go through any of
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:34.680]  this stuff and they're able to carrying drugs with them
[1:43:34.680 --> 1:43:39.040]  uh... thinking ron contra it's open season on the american people we're all
[1:43:39.040 --> 1:43:43.240]  being controlled and enslaved so that the government with their special access
[1:43:43.240 --> 1:43:46.720]  in their private access in private security they can come goes they will
[1:43:46.720 --> 1:43:48.200]  they can do whatever they want
[1:43:48.200 --> 1:43:50.680]  uh... i don't know if you saw the story with this mayor
[1:43:50.680 --> 1:43:53.520]  got caught on videotape stealing ladies on these
[1:43:53.520 --> 1:43:57.000]  there the problem with power with political power is it's going to attract
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:44:00.880]  the wrong kind of people it attracts the people who shouldn't have it and we
[1:44:00.880 --> 1:44:05.080]  allow it to happen how many scumbags in business in life if you ran into who
[1:44:05.080 --> 1:44:09.000]  just want to do bad who just want to steal who just want to cheat who enjoy
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:14.120]  lying who enjoy playing the victim who enjoy manipulating people that's what
[1:44:14.120 --> 1:44:18.800]  we've got is a competition of the greatest scum to get into positions of
[1:44:18.800 --> 1:44:23.240]  power with each other so the very worst get into control
[1:44:23.240 --> 1:44:27.120]  well the problem is that you know all of the rules and all the morality is just
[1:44:27.120 --> 1:44:30.880]  something they see as being used to control the masses and they they never
[1:44:30.880 --> 1:44:32.840]  believe that it applies to them
[1:44:32.840 --> 1:44:36.120]  they answer to a higher authority or they think adam smith was absolutely
[1:44:36.120 --> 1:44:40.120]  right that you can be a total greedy person and somehow you're benefiting the
[1:44:40.120 --> 1:44:41.120]  system as a whole
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:44.640]  obviously looking at our current economy that was completely false but they
[1:44:44.640 --> 1:44:47.680]  still want to subscribe to that theory just as they're still clinging to go
[1:44:47.680 --> 1:44:51.360]  and it's all lies they keep telling us that the economy is great
[1:44:51.360 --> 1:44:56.320]  i have a stack right here roiders u.s growth prospects deemed bleak in new
[1:44:56.320 --> 1:44:57.200]  decade
[1:44:57.200 --> 1:45:01.880]  our gdp plunges personal bankruptcy filings rising faster record level
[1:45:01.880 --> 1:45:03.160]  wall street journal
[1:45:03.160 --> 1:45:07.360]  economic policy journal robert rubin the main culprit all hell could break loose
[1:45:07.360 --> 1:45:10.680]  because of huge government debt they want a new excise tax
[1:45:10.680 --> 1:45:14.120]  they want a new value-added tax they have glenn bet calling for it calling a
[1:45:14.120 --> 1:45:15.160]  conservative
[1:45:15.160 --> 1:45:18.880]  uh... we've got american job satisfaction falls to record low
[1:45:18.880 --> 1:45:20.120]  totally forty five
[1:45:20.120 --> 1:45:21.360]  uh... percent
[1:45:21.360 --> 1:45:24.160]  uh... we've got uh... editorial hiding
[1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:27.720]  health bills behind closed doors washington times u.s news and world
[1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:31.360]  report democratic leaders plan secret health care reform deliberations
[1:45:31.360 --> 1:45:32.720]  everything's secret
[1:45:32.720 --> 1:45:34.040]  everything's criminal
[1:45:34.040 --> 1:45:37.000]  they just do whatever they want
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:40.600]  and they're telling us the economy's wonderful as everyone i know is losing
[1:45:40.600 --> 1:45:44.360]  their job getting pay cuts everything's falling apart and the media saying
[1:45:44.360 --> 1:45:47.160]  we're in a naked body scan you
[1:45:47.160 --> 1:45:50.480]  what we have right now the only part of the economy that looks good is the
[1:45:50.480 --> 1:45:54.160]  dow industrial averages and we're seeing more and more indications that that is
[1:45:54.160 --> 1:45:57.880]  being manipulated the plunge protection team is in there the u.s government is
[1:45:57.880 --> 1:46:02.040]  buying stocks in order to drive up their value so they can use the dow as a
[1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:06.640]  political banner see the economy's good the dow is up if you're not doing well
[1:46:06.640 --> 1:46:11.120]  it's your own fault but they popped twenty eight plus trill they just
[1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:14.640]  admitted four trillion more on top of twenty three point seven trill so it
[1:46:14.640 --> 1:46:18.000]  comes up up to right at twenty eight trill they've popped twenty eight trill
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:20.880]  of our money into their own investments
[1:46:20.880 --> 1:46:23.480]  that's absolutely true and the a i g's
[1:46:23.480 --> 1:46:26.800]  uh... rather goldman sacks is keeping the bonuses obama promised he was going
[1:46:26.800 --> 1:46:30.880]  to get a profit to get their internal documents how they engineered the whole
[1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:33.160]  thing the clatchy newspapers admits it
[1:46:33.160 --> 1:46:35.320]  i mean this is hell on earth
[1:46:35.320 --> 1:46:39.960]  they made a huge fortune helping to destroy the american economy and you
[1:46:39.960 --> 1:46:43.280]  know what is the goal here of the government are they trying to crash the
[1:46:43.280 --> 1:46:47.560]  yes look at the u n saying they wanted to industrialize paying to move steel
[1:46:47.560 --> 1:46:51.440]  mills and power plants out of the u.s to india
[1:46:51.440 --> 1:46:54.760]  and we're left out without any manufacturing
[1:46:54.760 --> 1:46:58.800]  we're left with slot teams running around urinating on us
[1:46:58.800 --> 1:47:02.000]  what are we supposed to do to pay our bills that's the part that really makes
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:02.840]  it look
[1:47:02.840 --> 1:47:06.400]  like the government wanted they want a rebellion they want a rebellion they
[1:47:06.400 --> 1:47:09.100]  want violence going to get it they're going to get it
[1:47:09.100 --> 1:47:12.840]  i don't like violence but it does seem like we're headed in that direction
[1:47:12.840 --> 1:47:15.120]  it's a master plan card
[1:47:15.120 --> 1:47:18.600]  i'm telling you man i can't
[1:47:18.600 --> 1:47:22.000]  so i just popped my ear what's that
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:24.200]  i was just thinking about sending a story to curtain and all that's why i
[1:47:24.200 --> 1:47:26.840]  called him curtain i know he's micro arrow

[1:47:37.280 --> 1:47:40.920]  what we need is anger in the people and i'm still amazed that we're not getting
[1:47:40.920 --> 1:47:42.120]  it
[1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:46.520]  i just don't even know what to do any more mic i just

[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:07.640]  seriously this is all so far gone
[1:48:07.640 --> 1:48:09.280]  uh... images

[1:48:13.640 --> 1:48:17.960]  we just get that far gone and just kind of give up no we have to stand up and go
[1:48:17.960 --> 1:48:20.640]  this is the moment when they really come out in the open we got to go your
[1:48:20.640 --> 1:48:22.080]  criminal degenerates
[1:48:22.080 --> 1:48:26.120]  your criminals your criminals your kids chanted you are criminals you are a

[1:48:48.520 --> 1:48:53.080]  uh... just read an article calling this last decade of the last decade
[1:48:53.080 --> 1:48:56.840]  and i i completely disagree with that i think the next one coming uh... the one
[1:48:56.840 --> 1:48:59.720]  we just entered is going to be the last decade for sure
[1:48:59.720 --> 1:49:02.600]  and uh... we're starting to see all the signs of the uh...
[1:49:02.600 --> 1:49:05.840]  the mobilization towards this world government just have you you've been
[1:49:05.840 --> 1:49:09.560]  uh... covering uh... it's all coming together right now
[1:49:09.560 --> 1:49:13.160]  and it seems like world government is out in the open
[1:49:13.160 --> 1:49:16.680]  and i'll be at the park with my kids and some yuppie walk over and start
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:18.240]  laughing at me saying
[1:49:18.240 --> 1:49:19.440]  you're a cook
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:23.400]  these fools have no idea what's happening to them
[1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:26.960]  micro vero what do you call this sick psychology where people make a hundred
[1:49:26.960 --> 1:49:29.920]  thousand dollars a year think they're part of the elite and think of they
[1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:33.680]  just psychologically buddy up to the tyranny and make a joke out of it that
[1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:36.320]  it's somehow funny and cute
[1:49:36.320 --> 1:49:40.240]  well i call it the good germans syndrome and you know because there were
[1:49:40.240 --> 1:49:43.880]  people in germany who wall wanted to be cozy and buddy buddy with hitler that
[1:49:43.880 --> 1:49:44.760]  didn't work out
[1:49:44.760 --> 1:49:47.560]  stalling used to call people like that useful idiots
[1:49:47.560 --> 1:49:51.480]  every society has them they're in denial about what's going on
[1:49:51.480 --> 1:49:54.680]  they're like abused children where they think if i just go along with the
[1:49:54.680 --> 1:49:58.360]  abuse maybe it won't get any worse and of course history shows that yeah when
[1:49:58.360 --> 1:50:02.680]  you go along with being abused it is going to get worse because abusers
[1:50:02.680 --> 1:50:07.200]  don't know how we need a headline at info wars dot com an article explaining
[1:50:07.200 --> 1:50:10.960]  that we have the stock home syndrome and you know what that is mike
[1:50:10.960 --> 1:50:15.240]  absolutely and it was abuse child syndrome where the abused children will
[1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:19.320]  work to protect the abusing parent and to defend them and to justify them and
[1:50:19.320 --> 1:50:23.080]  that's exactly where we are with a huge segment of the american population and
[1:50:23.080 --> 1:50:27.480]  i think the government planners are relying on that and they're figuring
[1:50:27.480 --> 1:50:30.800]  that if they start to abuse us more and more and more that people will just say
[1:50:30.800 --> 1:50:34.440]  oh please but you know i'm being a good american don't abuse me anymore i won't
[1:50:34.440 --> 1:50:39.240]  say anything i won't complain and it is it's a classic abuse child pattern
[1:50:39.240 --> 1:50:42.760]  well it's like kids i would see getting beat up when they got up the school bus
[1:50:42.760 --> 1:50:45.880]  putting up with it and the bullies came like flies
[1:50:45.880 --> 1:50:49.080]  not me bullies ran when they saw me because i'm like hey you may be bigger
[1:50:49.080 --> 1:50:53.160]  than me you want some i mean i don't understand the love of cowardice the
[1:50:53.160 --> 1:50:57.720]  love of rolling over i don't have courage i am just not a slave i'm a real

[1:54:29.720 --> 1:54:33.320]  we have to stop rolling over to this tyranny stop capitulating
[1:54:33.320 --> 1:54:37.240]  to it ladies and gentlemen and i do see people waking up i do see people
[1:54:37.240 --> 1:54:41.000]  getting angry and churned off and others already made the deals to
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:44.200]  some numbers are as high as nine billion for these scanners and
[1:54:44.200 --> 1:54:48.120]  other systems i mean this is just outrageous
[1:54:48.120 --> 1:54:53.480]  to see them out in the open doing this making money enslaving us mike
[1:54:53.480 --> 1:54:57.000]  it is it's just absolutely it's very depressing to see
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:00.200]  but you were talking in the last segment about standing up
[1:55:00.200 --> 1:55:04.120]  and and and saying i'm not going to be a slave anymore and i keep thinking about
[1:55:04.120 --> 1:55:07.640]  what is the institution that we have in our society that is always teaching us
[1:55:07.640 --> 1:55:11.480]  to be on our knees and to turn the other cheek and not fight back
[1:55:11.480 --> 1:55:14.920]  and it seems to be organized religion which may explain why they get all these
[1:55:14.920 --> 1:55:18.120]  tax breaks from the government and it almost seems sometimes like
[1:55:18.120 --> 1:55:22.040]  religion or organized commercial religion is definitely on the side of
[1:55:22.040 --> 1:55:25.240]  the government where they're working to try and talk us out of
[1:55:25.240 --> 1:55:28.200]  fighting back against oh yeah clergy response teams
[1:55:28.200 --> 1:55:31.960]  faith-based initiative in the last nine years has completely taken over all the
[1:55:31.960 --> 1:55:35.880]  denominations and we got the secret documents now mainstream media admits it
[1:55:35.880 --> 1:55:40.120]  the preachers are training their flocks quote for martial law
[1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:43.400]  yeah render unto Caesar and and all the rest of that
[1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:46.920]  so we need to recognize that those churches they're part of the problem
[1:55:46.920 --> 1:55:49.880]  they are not working for the freedom of the people i think one of the popes
[1:55:49.880 --> 1:55:52.520]  once said there never should have been a bill of rights
[1:55:52.520 --> 1:55:57.320]  because god does not grant to man writes a freedom of speech and freedom of
[1:55:57.320 --> 1:56:02.200]  of movement unbelievable and then now the pope's calling for a global tax for
[1:56:02.200 --> 1:56:05.640]  the environment uh... it's just a scott world government's
[1:56:05.640 --> 1:56:10.200]  being openly called for i mean this is just outrageous
[1:56:10.200 --> 1:56:14.760]  it really really is the only good news is that the the uh... failure of the when
[1:56:14.760 --> 1:56:18.680]  pigs fly flew to become the the scourge that it was promised
[1:56:18.680 --> 1:56:21.480]  the failure of the human cause global warming agenda
[1:56:21.480 --> 1:56:24.680]  those were two of the three pillars on which the foundation for global
[1:56:24.680 --> 1:56:28.680]  government was being built so they're in serious trouble right now
[1:56:28.680 --> 1:56:32.440]  because the credibility of global government is very damaged people are
[1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:34.920]  not seeing it as a blessing and a benefit
[1:56:34.920 --> 1:56:38.120]  they're seeing it as the enemy of their own personal freedom
[1:56:38.120 --> 1:56:41.480]  and so i think people are starting to dig their heels in but they need to get
[1:56:41.480 --> 1:56:44.920]  angry they need to find out whatever it is that's in their diet or their
[1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:48.520]  lifestyle or whatever that is persuading them not to be angry
[1:56:48.520 --> 1:56:52.440]  they need to understand that anger is a defense mechanism it is a survival
[1:56:52.440 --> 1:56:55.080]  mechanism and they need to start getting into that
[1:56:55.080 --> 1:56:59.160]  because anger is going to give you the energy and enthusiasm to do what needs
[1:56:59.160 --> 1:57:02.600]  to be done to secure your freedoms government never makes you free
[1:57:02.600 --> 1:57:05.320]  you have to take your freedom from the government
[1:57:05.320 --> 1:57:08.760]  well expanding on that you're right they've tried the fake global warming
[1:57:08.760 --> 1:57:11.240]  they're still moving forward on that but they're damaged
[1:57:11.240 --> 1:57:14.920]  they tried uh... the fake swine flew that blew up in their face a big
[1:57:14.920 --> 1:57:18.600]  disaster forum all this news in europe of indictments and corruption at the
[1:57:18.600 --> 1:57:21.640]  un fear mongering it with companies to make money
[1:57:21.640 --> 1:57:25.240]  uh... and so they're falling back on terror but it's come out that ridge the
[1:57:25.240 --> 1:57:30.200]  last homeland security had admitted that it was all fake and done for political
[1:57:30.200 --> 1:57:33.880]  purposes we have the facts we have the proof
[1:57:33.880 --> 1:57:37.240]  and for all of you yuppies and people that haven't spoken up or people that are
[1:57:37.240 --> 1:57:40.600]  awake who haven't gotten involved you better do it quick folks
[1:57:40.600 --> 1:57:45.000]  this is serious tyranny we're dealing with this isn't your mama's tyranny
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  this is a high-tech really vicious tyranny and don't say you weren't warned
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:51.560]  you know in the end we're going to win mike even though things are going to get
[1:57:51.560 --> 1:57:54.600]  a lot worse because you and i and countless others
[1:57:54.600 --> 1:57:59.160]  have planted the seeds of truth and people ignored us but they now remember
[1:57:59.160 --> 1:58:01.800]  what we said and now it's triggering they're waking up
[1:58:01.800 --> 1:58:05.400]  and that's why i think we have a good chance of turning this around if we
[1:58:05.400 --> 1:58:09.480]  offer people the alternative of a free society an open society
[1:58:09.480 --> 1:58:14.440]  and and and really document what we could be instead of what we're becoming
[1:58:14.440 --> 1:58:18.280]  absolutely true and uh... the main thing is people are recognizing
[1:58:18.280 --> 1:58:21.800]  the government is lying they're looking for somebody to tell them what's really
[1:58:21.800 --> 1:58:25.320]  going on and of course they're coming to our radio shows and our websites

[2:01:00.040 --> 2:01:03.880]  happening with the economy robert rubin one of the chief architects of the
[2:01:03.880 --> 2:01:08.040]  economic implosion by design saying we need new taxes or we're all
[2:01:08.040 --> 2:01:12.200]  sunk taxes paid to the banks in interest on money we gave them
[2:01:12.200 --> 2:01:14.680]  we're going to talk about the government takeover of health care that even
[2:01:14.680 --> 2:01:19.080]  howard dean says is a ripoff it's all coming up with max keiser
[2:01:19.080 --> 2:01:22.120]  uh but max i've been talking the last two hours about
[2:01:22.120 --> 2:01:26.440]  the capitulation to tyranny the naked body scanners the london guardian
[2:01:26.440 --> 2:01:30.920]  uh saying new scanners break child porn laws the articles we have up on prison
[2:01:30.920 --> 2:01:35.800]  planet dot com a call to action to boycott this uh max keiser good to
[2:01:35.800 --> 2:01:39.560]  have you with us yeah alex jones happy new year
[2:01:39.560 --> 2:01:44.200]  you know this is a continuation of what i've been talking about what i call the
[2:01:44.200 --> 2:01:49.400]  casino gulag model the casino part of course
[2:01:49.400 --> 2:01:54.600]  is that the stocks in all these body scanning machines of skyrocketed a
[2:01:54.600 --> 2:01:59.720]  couple of them up 25 percent recently and that's the whole casino
[2:01:59.720 --> 2:02:05.400]  aspect of the economy and the people who are behind these attacks of course are
[2:02:05.400 --> 2:02:09.320]  professional speculators gamblers stock market players
[2:02:09.320 --> 2:02:14.920]  and this goes all the way back to 2001 in the 911 incident we've got professional
[2:02:14.920 --> 2:02:18.040]  speculators who are involved in all these incidents
[2:02:18.040 --> 2:02:22.040]  uh and they're making big big big uh big bucks
[2:02:22.040 --> 2:02:27.480]  and the legislation is always about making it easier for speculators
[2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:31.480]  and making it harder for people who want to save money
[2:02:31.480 --> 2:02:35.160]  uh who want to get a rate of return their savings who want to get a decent job
[2:02:35.160 --> 2:02:38.920]  who want to get a decent wage those people are being put into the gulag
[2:02:38.920 --> 2:02:43.320]  that's the gulag side of the equation and the casino side the professional
[2:02:43.320 --> 2:02:46.440]  speculators are winning so it's the professional
[2:02:46.440 --> 2:02:50.440]  speculators of casino versus all the wage earners and savers in the gulag
[2:02:50.440 --> 2:02:54.760]  and that's been going on for years i've talked about it on your show many times
[2:02:54.760 --> 2:03:00.440]  so the casino economy the casino economy is eating the final remnants
[2:03:00.440 --> 2:03:06.360]  of the real economy and they're making all their profits in
[2:03:06.360 --> 2:03:11.560]  the run-up to total control of society pretty much uh you know they want to
[2:03:11.560 --> 2:03:15.000]  make a hundred percent on their money in five weeks
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:18.760]  instead of five months or a year or two years
[2:03:18.760 --> 2:03:22.600]  you know it's always faster to make money on crashes
[2:03:22.600 --> 2:03:26.360]  uh than it is to make money on the way up you know markets tend to crash
[2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:30.440]  faster than they build up over time because fear is a lot more powerful than
[2:03:30.440 --> 2:03:33.480]  faith and when people get frightened they sell
[2:03:33.480 --> 2:03:37.160]  uh indiscriminately and you see market crashes are huge opportunities to make
[2:03:37.160 --> 2:03:41.240]  money but now we're seeing a kind of a a new play where
[2:03:41.240 --> 2:03:46.920]  the fear this time is driving money into the scanning machines and the sole
[2:03:46.920 --> 2:03:51.240]  infrastructure of the gulag uh which you've seen dramatically on
[2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:53.720]  wall street there's huge profits being made
[2:03:53.720 --> 2:03:57.640]  and um on the on the comment to the um
[2:03:57.640 --> 2:04:02.600]  dissect the uh scanning machines and this idea that they violate child porn
[2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:06.920]  laws and this type of thing you know i harken back to a piece that was written
[2:04:06.920 --> 2:04:12.760]  by Naomi Wolfe uh back in july of 2008 where she talks
[2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:18.120]  about the whole abu grade prison scandal was in part driven by the bush white
[2:04:18.120 --> 2:04:21.880]  house uh sado porn desires that these tapes were
[2:04:21.880 --> 2:04:26.200]  flown to the white house and viewed by the insiders in the white house so now
[2:04:26.200 --> 2:04:30.200]  extend that to what these what you're talking about others are talking about
[2:04:30.200 --> 2:04:33.800]  these um scanning machines just videotape
[2:04:33.800 --> 2:04:38.440]  porn and child porn for the amusement of the casino operators
[2:04:38.440 --> 2:04:42.120]  and they're putting everyone through this that's just a few million people
[2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:45.720]  because they're sick it's an act of submission if you can make people hurt
[2:04:45.720 --> 2:04:48.840]  their kids through openly be scan naked you can get
[2:04:48.840 --> 2:04:51.640]  anything you want max keiser stay there let's continue
[2:04:51.640 --> 2:04:55.800]  calls coming up and a lot more your financial look into 2010

[2:08:27.720 --> 2:08:33.160]  in the featured news section
[2:08:34.120 --> 2:08:37.640]  are several of the most important articles i have ever
[2:08:37.640 --> 2:08:43.400]  posted written by paul watson airports set to become primary peddlers of
[2:08:43.400 --> 2:08:46.760]  child porn if you doubt me here is the london
[2:08:46.760 --> 2:08:51.080]  guardian today new scanners break child porn laws
[2:08:51.080 --> 2:08:54.920]  now every day without even looking because there's so many thousands of
[2:08:54.920 --> 2:08:59.960]  people being charged under this at the public schools they confiscate
[2:08:59.960 --> 2:09:03.560]  teenagers cameras their phones that are cameras
[2:09:03.560 --> 2:09:09.560]  and they look through them and how many 16 17 15 year old girls send a topless
[2:09:09.560 --> 2:09:15.000]  picture to their boyfriend how many
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:18.840]  a lot and they charge her and the boyfriend they send it to
[2:09:18.840 --> 2:09:22.520]  for child pornography but then the government
[2:09:22.520 --> 2:09:26.600]  videotapes this and saves it and it's a okay but in england they're saying we
[2:09:26.600 --> 2:09:29.880]  got to change the laws for child porn to allow this
[2:09:29.880 --> 2:09:33.160]  that article needs to get out to everyone virally so everyone knows what's
[2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:37.160]  happening another big story written today where i break it all
[2:09:37.160 --> 2:09:39.880]  down alex jones calls for massive resistance
[2:09:39.880 --> 2:09:43.800]  to implementation of body scanners next hour i'm going to break all this down
[2:09:43.800 --> 2:09:47.800]  open the phones only on this subject for your ideas of the boycott
[2:09:47.800 --> 2:09:51.320]  i've got a good idea because i know the legal system and how these airports are
[2:09:51.320 --> 2:09:54.040]  set up and how they're doing this through color of law
[2:09:54.040 --> 2:09:57.320]  if max keiser's got an idea he's welcome to tell us do we go after the stock
[2:09:57.320 --> 2:10:01.160]  peddlers of this uh do we go after the companies
[2:10:01.160 --> 2:10:04.840]  do people suit shirt off who makes money off this running around promoting it
[2:10:04.840 --> 2:10:08.200]  what do we do they're gonna look at the economy and take your phone calls
[2:10:08.200 --> 2:10:12.680]  and get into government run health care max keiser continuing
[2:10:12.680 --> 2:10:17.240]  oh yeah well i had that dr bruce uh lou v on my show
[2:10:17.240 --> 2:10:20.920]  last week and he talks about something called the abuse syndrome
[2:10:20.920 --> 2:10:24.760]  and uh what this means basically is that as people
[2:10:24.760 --> 2:10:28.360]  sit back and watch their government sexually humiliate them
[2:10:28.360 --> 2:10:31.400]  in public and without any recourse without anyone
[2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:35.400]  doing anything it creates a feedback loop of continued
[2:10:35.400 --> 2:10:39.160]  uh depression and a feeling of helplessness and that's
[2:10:39.160 --> 2:10:43.800]  the same kind of mentality you find in any abusive situation you know a pimp
[2:10:43.800 --> 2:10:47.240]  and their um the per person working for them
[2:10:47.240 --> 2:10:51.640]  uh any kind of abusive situation the abuse of husband toward the wife etc
[2:10:51.640 --> 2:10:55.960]  so as these things are played out in the media and people see that the government
[2:10:55.960 --> 2:11:01.160]  is involved in sexual abuse of minors on a wholesale level
[2:11:01.160 --> 2:11:06.680]  uh to put to to satisfy some six six sexual tendencies again from paragraph
[2:11:06.680 --> 2:11:11.400]  four of this they only want particle he says the the sexualization of torture
[2:11:11.400 --> 2:11:14.680]  from the top uh in washington basically turned a boo
[2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:19.160]  grave in guantanamo bay into an organized sex crime ring
[2:11:19.160 --> 2:11:23.240]  in which the traffic sex slaves were us held prisoners
[2:11:23.240 --> 2:11:28.040]  so that was the u.s. getting a taste and notice max max we're all on the same
[2:11:28.040 --> 2:11:31.160]  page i said all this in the first hour hadn't
[2:11:31.160 --> 2:11:34.440]  heard what you had to say hadn't read namie wolf's article
[2:11:34.440 --> 2:11:38.040]  uh mike revero hadn't heard what i had to say
[2:11:38.040 --> 2:11:41.560]  he said the exact same thing the stock home syndrome
[2:11:41.560 --> 2:11:45.000]  uh now you're saying the exact same thing the expert you interviewed tell us
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:48.360]  more about him and perhaps we'll play a clip of that video if you tell us the
[2:11:48.360 --> 2:11:52.120]  name of the video at max keiser dot com you've got so many tv shows on so many
[2:11:52.120 --> 2:11:54.040]  networks it's hard to know which one to pull up
[2:11:54.040 --> 2:11:57.480]  but here's the stock home syndrome stock home syndrome
[2:11:57.480 --> 2:12:01.560]  is a psychological response sometimes seen in abducted hostages
[2:12:01.560 --> 2:12:04.760]  and that's what a these pimps literally have these women as slaves
[2:12:04.760 --> 2:12:08.440]  in which the hostage shows signs of loyalty to the hostage taker
[2:12:08.440 --> 2:12:11.800]  regardless of the danger or risk in which they have been placed
[2:12:11.800 --> 2:12:15.960]  the syndrome is named after and it goes into it and this is what we see over
[2:12:15.960 --> 2:12:18.920]  and over again well i'm not a mentally ill person
[2:12:18.920 --> 2:12:23.000]  i'm angry and i'm i'm enraged and no more you criminal
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:26.840]  scum running the government max and this is going in globally max go ahead
[2:12:26.840 --> 2:12:31.080]  yeah well it's uh part three of the video on max keiser dot com on the right
[2:12:31.080 --> 2:12:34.280]  hand side to scroll down there's four parts for my recent
[2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:38.200]  show uh on the edge starting in part three is the interview
[2:12:38.200 --> 2:12:42.280]  with dr levine and what's the name of that particular video of on the edge
[2:12:42.280 --> 2:12:46.040]  though part three yeah and i brought up the uh but the videos always have a
[2:12:46.040 --> 2:12:51.080]  name max what's the name of it well if you just go it's on the edge
[2:12:51.080 --> 2:12:54.920]  on the edge part three i think it's on my max keiser dot com site
[2:12:54.920 --> 2:12:58.360]  okay they found it we're going to play that clip before you leave us go ahead
[2:12:58.360 --> 2:13:01.560]  okay well it's uh it you know it's a 10 minute interview so i don't know if you
[2:13:01.560 --> 2:13:05.800]  have time for that but the um i brought up the stock home syndrome as well with
[2:13:05.800 --> 2:13:09.640]  dr bruce levine and he his work goes into uh something a little bit more
[2:13:09.640 --> 2:13:13.800]  comprehensive he really gets into it and and talks specifically about
[2:13:13.800 --> 2:13:17.400]  about the policies today that are coming out of the white house
[2:13:17.400 --> 2:13:21.000]  to foster this the abuse syndrome in the population
[2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:25.400]  as a way to keep them uh depressed and to make them malleable
[2:13:25.400 --> 2:13:29.560]  and this whole body scanning uh sexual torture
[2:13:29.560 --> 2:13:33.880]  is just part and parcel of of it couldn't of this whole model that that i've
[2:13:33.880 --> 2:13:37.320]  been aware for a while what i which i call the casino gulag model and the
[2:13:37.320 --> 2:13:40.920]  reason why people who are being more than reasons why people are being allowed
[2:13:40.920 --> 2:13:44.520]  themselves to be subjected to this type of humiliation
[2:13:44.520 --> 2:13:48.280]  is that the you know the casino part of the equation is very good at holding out
[2:13:48.280 --> 2:13:51.400]  of carrot and making people believe that they're
[2:13:51.400 --> 2:13:54.280]  going to win the lotto they're going to win the casino job they're going to get a
[2:13:54.280 --> 2:13:58.280]  job at goldman sacks they're going to become a huge beneficiary somehow of
[2:13:58.280 --> 2:14:00.600]  all of the insider trading and market manipulation
[2:14:00.600 --> 2:14:03.880]  and that's the hope that people think in the back of their mind they're willing
[2:14:03.880 --> 2:14:07.240]  to put up with anything they're willing to put up with strip searches at the
[2:14:07.240 --> 2:14:10.360]  airport they think that by some chance they're going to have the winning lotto
[2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:13.320]  ticket and that's what the the media particularly
[2:14:13.320 --> 2:14:17.640]  outlets like cnbc which has the ticker tape running 24 seven and jim
[2:14:17.640 --> 2:14:20.440]  kramer he's pounding the table you can be a winner
[2:14:20.440 --> 2:14:24.360]  you can make a fortune in this stock what all he's doing is he's unloading
[2:14:24.360 --> 2:14:28.120]  stocks and institutions don't know he's laundering stocks for the banks
[2:14:28.120 --> 2:14:30.920]  which are laundering all of their tarp money vis-a-vis
[2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:35.400]  jim kramer on cnbc and it's it's just like going into any casino which is
[2:14:35.400 --> 2:14:38.200]  surrounded by slot machines where the odds of winning are
[2:14:38.200 --> 2:14:41.800]  definitely against you and hookers you know if you could see but it doesn't
[2:14:41.800 --> 2:14:45.320]  have unfortunately this casino gulag mile in america
[2:14:45.320 --> 2:14:50.680]  the food is not cheap and the housing is not cheap that's the big difference
[2:14:50.680 --> 2:14:55.080]  continuum well um i i think that
[2:14:55.080 --> 2:14:58.360]  there's i'll put something on the table here for you to consider
[2:14:58.360 --> 2:15:03.080]  which is that the country that was the first into the
[2:15:03.080 --> 2:15:06.840]  into the meat grinder of this huge globalized
[2:15:06.840 --> 2:15:12.840]  syndicated fraud it was iceland and iceland the icelandic population the
[2:15:12.840 --> 2:15:16.760]  bankers at out of waltzy now i was in iceland as you know i made a film
[2:15:16.760 --> 2:15:20.360]  about this i was in iceland and a year before it collapsed
[2:15:20.360 --> 2:15:24.040]  it's a film on youtube called money geyser i sat down bankers in iceland and i
[2:15:24.040 --> 2:15:27.960]  said your corona and your economy is about to collapse they said no
[2:15:27.960 --> 2:15:32.760]  no it's not that night i was in a sushi restaurant in
[2:15:32.760 --> 2:15:38.120]  a um a hotel hotel 101 in rakeya thick and there were these layman brothers
[2:15:38.120 --> 2:15:41.400]  brokers and of course i worked on a lawsuit for many years so i struck up a
[2:15:41.400 --> 2:15:44.520]  conversation and they were telling me that they were plotting
[2:15:44.520 --> 2:15:49.560]  to crash the corona to make a huge score and i said yeah but the banker here just
[2:15:49.560 --> 2:15:53.160]  told me that you know this economy is in great shape you know it sounds risky
[2:15:53.160 --> 2:15:56.200]  they're like no no no you don't understand they've they've
[2:15:56.200 --> 2:15:59.640]  leveraged themselves 10 to 1 the entire gdp is the leverage 10 to 1
[2:15:59.640 --> 2:16:03.240]  and we've got this global syndicate of short sellers and all of our regular
[2:16:03.240 --> 2:16:06.360]  crew and we're going to take this corona we're going to take this economy down
[2:16:06.360 --> 2:16:10.600]  and we're going to score huge and that's exactly what they did and golden sacks
[2:16:10.600 --> 2:16:14.280]  pilots the entire banking system and policy and has their people at all
[2:16:14.280 --> 2:16:18.200]  levels of government instead of the being arrested and the nightmare ending
[2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:21.400]  it isn't going to end it's going to get more and more hellish
[2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:25.480]  and jack bauer tortures people to get answers and torture children
[2:16:25.480 --> 2:16:29.720]  everybody fantasizes to be a torturer now they all get to be tortured
[2:16:29.720 --> 2:16:33.080]  or you go get a job as a humiliator and an abuser
[2:16:33.080 --> 2:16:37.240]  and it just gets sicker and sicker and sicker
[2:16:37.240 --> 2:16:43.080]  well now in iceland uh they are voting on whether or not to reimburse
[2:16:43.080 --> 2:16:47.640]  the u k government for millions of dollars
[2:16:47.640 --> 2:16:54.600]  that were uh guaranteed by the bankers on the uk stavers five and a half billion
[2:16:54.600 --> 2:17:00.280]  dollars of the savings that were used to to fuel the speculative
[2:17:00.280 --> 2:17:06.600]  run-up in rakyovic and now the uk government classified iceland as a
[2:17:06.600 --> 2:17:11.160]  terrorist for not paying back for not allowing the citizens to be forced to
[2:17:11.160 --> 2:17:14.920]  pay back the the speculative money that was lost by the bankers
[2:17:14.920 --> 2:17:19.640]  and now they want the citizens to fork over billions of dollars to
[2:17:19.640 --> 2:17:22.680]  for restitution to the bankers and the speculators
[2:17:22.680 --> 2:17:26.520]  and if they don't do that they're threatening all kinds of draconian
[2:17:26.520 --> 2:17:31.240]  measures and destitution in in iceland and the people have been out there
[2:17:31.240 --> 2:17:34.840]  riding in the street because they're being forced to ride in the
[2:17:34.840 --> 2:17:37.480]  streets because the bankers are putting them out of their homes

[2:17:53.480 --> 2:17:56.360]  months ago in the london guardian like it was normal
[2:17:56.360 --> 2:18:00.520]  that that brown used anti-terror legislation
[2:18:00.520 --> 2:18:05.560]  to seize the bank accounts of icelanders that had their money in british
[2:18:05.560 --> 2:18:09.800]  banks inside iceland and without so for those that want to know

[2:18:35.640 --> 2:18:41.880]  possible for the banks to declare that they are not going to honor
[2:18:41.880 --> 2:18:45.720]  money market funds that they can see money market funds

[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:30.440]  our country is descending into
[2:24:30.440 --> 2:24:33.480]  the most horrible sci-fi tyranny you could imagine
[2:24:33.480 --> 2:24:38.280]  the planet is falling to the terrorist that stage the terror attacks
[2:24:38.280 --> 2:24:42.440]  and then fund themselves off of all the security measures they put in
[2:24:42.440 --> 2:24:45.720]  max keiser calls coming up the next segment we're looking at the economy
[2:24:45.720 --> 2:24:49.320]  and what's happening there but continuing we're bringing up poindexter
[2:24:49.320 --> 2:24:52.120]  wanting to create this was in the washington post
[2:24:52.120 --> 2:24:55.960]  he in fact they tried to launch it well for those that don't know tell people
[2:24:55.960 --> 2:24:59.240]  about it literally making terrorism part of the economy and then i have
[2:24:59.240 --> 2:25:02.600]  another question that dovetails with that because we know about the insider
[2:25:02.600 --> 2:25:05.560]  trading on america and united before 9-11
[2:25:05.560 --> 2:25:09.720]  did you look at the stocks i haven't done this of the body scanner companies
[2:25:09.720 --> 2:25:14.520]  in the days before christmas let me guess i bet some bets were made that the
[2:25:14.520 --> 2:25:19.480]  stock was going to go way up i haven't looked at the the numbers on
[2:25:19.480 --> 2:25:22.760]  that let's get back to john john poindexter for a
[2:25:22.760 --> 2:25:26.120]  second you know john poindexter was uh higher up in the
[2:25:26.120 --> 2:25:31.640]  department of justice in the military in in the u.s and
[2:25:31.640 --> 2:25:35.720]  during this launch of the war on terror he they
[2:25:35.720 --> 2:25:39.960]  he launched the so-called policy analysis market
[2:25:39.960 --> 2:25:46.040]  or pam which was going to be an online virtual exchange where people can
[2:25:46.040 --> 2:25:51.240]  speculate on the next terror attack and john poindexter was saying well
[2:25:51.240 --> 2:25:55.240]  you know the point of this is to use the the markets which which are efficient
[2:25:55.240 --> 2:25:58.360]  you know the sole mantra that markets are efficient
[2:25:58.360 --> 2:26:03.080]  uh it was and that's part of the whole casino mentality is that the reason why
[2:26:03.080 --> 2:26:06.360]  everything has become securitized and everything is now a market and the
[2:26:06.360 --> 2:26:08.520]  health business is going to be on a market
[2:26:08.520 --> 2:26:12.360]  and and the you know the the climate change is going to be carbon trading
[2:26:12.360 --> 2:26:15.080]  market the reason everything is on a market is because there's this belief
[2:26:15.080 --> 2:26:18.200]  that markets are efficient so john poindexter's
[2:26:18.200 --> 2:26:21.560]  poindexter's saying that yes if we only turn terror
[2:26:21.560 --> 2:26:25.240]  into an online tradeable market then we would know in advance
[2:26:25.240 --> 2:26:28.760]  where the next strike is going to be and we would prepare accordingly
[2:26:28.760 --> 2:26:32.760]  but of course that all it does is it gives yet the insiders
[2:26:32.760 --> 2:26:36.280]  another way to profit on the terror that they themselves are stoking you know
[2:26:36.280 --> 2:26:41.000]  there that as the as ron paul has said recently
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:45.160]  they are terrorists because we're occupiers end quote
[2:26:45.160 --> 2:26:48.760]  and so if you're an occupying force and you're causing terror
[2:26:48.760 --> 2:26:53.080]  uh and you're already making billions well why not add another
[2:26:53.080 --> 2:26:56.760]  layer on top of this called the policy analysis market fell to the public as
[2:26:56.760 --> 2:26:59.720]  if you're going to help figure out the next attack but all this is you're
[2:26:59.720 --> 2:27:02.520]  just making more money on the attacks that you're already creating
[2:27:02.520 --> 2:27:07.080]  because they always it comes out no beforehand and let real attacks take
[2:27:07.080 --> 2:27:12.280]  place but more often than not they're staging the attack to begin with
[2:27:12.280 --> 2:27:17.000]  absolutely i mean the it's it's it's about making money
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:20.680]  much faster than waiting around in clipping coupons
[2:27:20.680 --> 2:27:23.560]  they're five percent or six percent on your money if you had a chance to make
[2:27:23.560 --> 2:27:27.080]  a hundred percent in five weeks then you'd go ahead and do it
[2:27:27.080 --> 2:27:31.800]  and that's what that's what's behind the all the policies all the policies in
[2:27:31.800 --> 2:27:34.680]  washington are created by speculators the
[2:27:34.680 --> 2:27:37.960]  energy policies are created by the oil speculators the health policies are
[2:27:37.960 --> 2:27:41.240]  created by the health and insurance industry which are speculators they're
[2:27:41.240 --> 2:27:44.360]  all basically speculating on the global markets
[2:27:44.360 --> 2:27:47.880]  one way or another the banking industry is certainly all the policies
[2:27:47.880 --> 2:27:51.240]  there are created by the banking industry it's like enron you remember
[2:27:51.240 --> 2:27:54.840]  enron created the energy policies under bush that's continued all the
[2:27:54.840 --> 2:27:59.320]  all these speculators write the policies in washington in ways that make it
[2:27:59.320 --> 2:28:02.360]  easier for them to speculate they've access to cheap money at the federal
[2:28:02.360 --> 2:28:05.160]  reserve at the near zero percent interest rate
[2:28:05.160 --> 2:28:08.280]  and there's no regulatory framework there's no glass deagle there's nothing
[2:28:08.280 --> 2:28:12.120]  holding back they can make all the crazy bets they want they can invade
[2:28:12.120 --> 2:28:15.480]  countries that they know are going to call certain stocks and commodities to
[2:28:15.480 --> 2:28:18.440]  go in certain ways bank the profits book the profits oh
[2:28:18.440 --> 2:28:21.880]  and whatever they make a mistake they claim oh it's terrorist and we need to
[2:28:21.880 --> 2:28:24.680]  go to the taxpayer to bail us out so it says we win
[2:28:24.680 --> 2:28:27.640]  tell everybody else loses they've been doing enough for years and that's why
[2:28:27.640 --> 2:28:31.320]  the wealth and income gap in america is so huge it's never been higher even
[2:28:31.320 --> 2:28:33.960]  during the robber baron period in american history he didn't have a
[2:28:33.960 --> 2:28:37.640]  wealth and income gap as high as it is now it's never been as high as it is
[2:28:37.640 --> 2:28:43.240]  right now this is exactly the situation that existed pre american
[2:28:43.240 --> 2:28:46.680]  uh war for independence america didn't want to be
[2:28:46.680 --> 2:28:51.400]  under the thumb of an aristocratic occupying royalty
[2:28:51.400 --> 2:28:56.520]  and but this is exactly the situation today the bankers are occupying force
[2:28:56.520 --> 2:29:00.920]  of aristocrats that are simply engaging in this casino gulag model
[2:29:00.920 --> 2:29:04.120]  where it says they win tells you lose and to keep us stupid
[2:29:04.120 --> 2:29:08.760]  and uh and in in line they bring in these uh airport scanners which are
[2:29:08.760 --> 2:29:12.120]  humiliating which is just a way to create
[2:29:12.120 --> 2:29:15.400]  mass depression and then they feed on that depression and of course they
[2:29:15.400 --> 2:29:18.920]  study the drugs they'll be treated for depression and of course the health
[2:29:18.920 --> 2:29:25.240]  industry policies are written by the drug companies who are also speculating
[2:29:25.240 --> 2:29:30.120]  max keiser is our guest we're going to get into his outlook for 2010 and the
[2:29:30.120 --> 2:29:33.000]  economy as things are consolidated and vertically integrated
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:37.320]  through the homeland security global dictatorship it's planetary

[2:30:19.080 --> 2:30:23.800]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us

[2:33:24.120 --> 2:33:27.720]  set this up first because max makes a good point
[2:33:27.720 --> 2:33:30.760]  you know shows like alex jones they're telling you the problem
[2:33:30.760 --> 2:33:37.240]  but what dr levine is saying on his show is that with the stock home syndrome
[2:33:37.240 --> 2:33:41.240]  with this abused person syndrome that if we don't then have solutions
[2:33:41.240 --> 2:33:44.280]  it makes people depressed well we are coming forward with the solutions we're
[2:33:44.280 --> 2:33:47.320]  saying we are talking to the listeners the next
[2:33:47.320 --> 2:33:50.680]  few days developing the boycott strategy
[2:33:50.680 --> 2:33:54.360]  just like we exposed kopenhagen is a fraud the swine flu is a fraud the
[2:33:54.360 --> 2:33:57.480]  banker bailout is a fraud to empower people
[2:33:57.480 --> 2:34:00.680]  because if the mainstream media is just saying we're gonna body scan you which
[2:34:00.680 --> 2:34:03.720]  90 plus percent of americans are against in polls some polls are 80
[2:34:03.720 --> 2:34:07.080]  the point is most people are against it they just put it out like it's a
[2:34:07.080 --> 2:34:10.920]  foregone conclusion that makes people depressed i'm here
[2:34:10.920 --> 2:34:14.760]  showing people we can win showing people we can take action but the people need
[2:34:14.760 --> 2:34:18.280]  to be upset they need to be instead of depressed angry
[2:34:18.280 --> 2:34:21.880]  and get out of their comfort zones and get angry enough to stand there with a
[2:34:21.880 --> 2:34:23.800]  sandwich board about how we're in a police state
[2:34:23.800 --> 2:34:27.000]  or to call in to talk radio or set up a website or go to city council
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:30.680]  or call their congressman or dump their stock in these body scanning companies
[2:34:30.680 --> 2:34:34.200]  about a lot of you own stock in these through
[2:34:34.200 --> 2:34:37.240]  401ks and mutual funds that don't even know it
[2:34:37.240 --> 2:34:40.280]  that that that that we're not going to put up with these body scanners that
[2:34:40.280 --> 2:34:42.760]  we're going to say no that we know their strategy
[2:34:42.760 --> 2:34:46.440]  of incrementally rolling them out so we understand the conditioning we need to
[2:34:46.440 --> 2:34:51.960]  say no now okay but max make your point about this
[2:34:51.960 --> 2:34:55.560]  right um it's an excellent interview he makes some great points
[2:34:55.560 --> 2:34:59.480]  and it's a great it's a great uh stepping off place for
[2:34:59.480 --> 2:35:02.120]  for a discussion and let me just add one quick
[2:35:02.120 --> 2:35:06.200]  uh comment to what you're saying you know this whole idea of boycotts that
[2:35:06.200 --> 2:35:10.600]  you've mentioned you know i have always believed that the best way to fight
[2:35:10.600 --> 2:35:14.840]  the speculators and the rogue capitalists is to come up with a way
[2:35:14.840 --> 2:35:19.080]  to beat them at their own game and in the area of boycotts
[2:35:19.080 --> 2:35:21.480]  if you look at all those companies out there
[2:35:21.480 --> 2:35:24.840]  there's actually a way to figure out which one is the most vulnerable to a
[2:35:24.840 --> 2:35:28.440]  boycott and then take that approach so in other words
[2:35:28.440 --> 2:35:32.920]  instead of trying to finesse it you take the approach of um
[2:35:32.920 --> 2:35:38.600]  you want to win and you want to win big and you apply the same dirty tactics
[2:35:38.600 --> 2:35:42.520]  that's being applied to us against them and i've done all the work on this and
[2:35:42.520 --> 2:35:45.480]  i'll be happy to talk to you about it you know let me after the break whatever
[2:35:45.480 --> 2:35:47.960]  you want to do well here's the issue and i'm not
[2:35:47.960 --> 2:35:52.920]  saying that isn't a good plan but we need multifaceted plans a lot of people
[2:35:52.920 --> 2:35:55.720]  don't have the money to go try to short these people
[2:35:55.720 --> 2:36:00.280]  or uh the system has the tens of trillions that the central banks give
[2:36:00.280 --> 2:36:04.280]  them that's how they're able to leverage and manipulate they'll look at gold
[2:36:04.280 --> 2:36:08.040]  they've been trying to suppress it but they've been largely unsuccessful
[2:36:08.040 --> 2:36:11.560]  uh so i think a general knowledge a general understanding of this that things
[2:36:11.560 --> 2:36:14.600]  are going to get worse if we don't stand up i mean
[2:36:14.600 --> 2:36:17.720]  i don't think it's well hold on to second max max i mean let me finish my
[2:36:17.720 --> 2:36:20.840]  statement here this is important there is a certain percentage of the
[2:36:20.840 --> 2:36:24.040]  population 25 30 percent from what i've researched on the
[2:36:24.040 --> 2:36:26.840]  stock home syndrome and and other similar syndromes
[2:36:26.840 --> 2:36:31.000]  that when they're being abused they roll over and defend the abuse
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:35.960]  but 70 percent or more don't five percent won the revolutionary war against
[2:36:35.960 --> 2:36:41.000]  king george the third so my issue is if i see a neighbor's house on fire and i
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:44.520]  run over and knock on their door and say your house is on fire if 25 percent
[2:36:44.520 --> 2:36:48.600]  run in and start loving the flames saying i'll hug the flames i'll love it
[2:36:48.600 --> 2:36:52.680]  that will make the fire go away or oh i'm gonna roast weenies it's okay
[2:36:52.680 --> 2:36:55.400]  because they decide to play the mental trick of crime stop
[2:36:55.400 --> 2:36:59.480]  that orwell talked about and they decide to just submit to it
[2:36:59.480 --> 2:37:04.040]  and to just go along with it that's their fault if 25 30 do that i'm not
[2:37:04.040 --> 2:37:07.720]  looking for the cowardly jellyfish that hear this and just go all shucks i'm
[2:37:07.720 --> 2:37:11.800]  going to accept it i'm here telling people we we have a duty to our children
[2:37:11.800 --> 2:37:17.640]  to say no to this max okay the problem as i see it with a multiple
[2:37:17.640 --> 2:37:23.240]  front attack is that you on that you uh... you needlessly dilute
[2:37:23.240 --> 2:37:28.360]  your your impact remember bruce lee and the one inch punch
[2:37:28.360 --> 2:37:31.000]  you know he's very famous for the one inch punch
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:34.120]  is there a one inch punch that we can use
[2:37:34.120 --> 2:37:39.000]  to topple one of these banksters one of these fraud companies i believe there
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:43.960]  is by instead of having a multiple head strategy that could be dilutive
[2:37:43.960 --> 2:37:48.120]  to focus our energy onto one single point of vulnerability
[2:37:48.120 --> 2:37:51.560]  and to kick it kick it so hard that it causes
[2:37:51.560 --> 2:37:55.640]  such a such an effect that it starts to re
[2:37:55.640 --> 2:37:59.000]  uh... balance the playing field i believe well max i don't think that's a
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:02.120]  i don't think that's a bad idea i think it's great i think educating people
[2:38:02.120 --> 2:38:06.920]  about the types of stocks and bonds they own and to really morally do research
[2:38:06.920 --> 2:38:11.240]  and not immorally invest in biometrics and body scanners
[2:38:11.240 --> 2:38:15.320]  and police state uh... implements and to invest in organic food
[2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:19.560]  true local sustainability you know that that the system creates fake counterfeits
[2:38:19.560 --> 2:38:24.360]  for i think that is a process uh... is uh... good
[2:38:24.360 --> 2:38:27.560]  uh... but the system is said they're not going to let their four or five big
[2:38:27.560 --> 2:38:30.600]  powerhouses go down too big to fail but we'll hear
[2:38:30.600 --> 2:38:33.960]  your one-inch punch idea or solution
[2:38:33.960 --> 2:38:37.320]  after we play this video clip with the doctor you were interviewing
[2:38:37.320 --> 2:38:41.320]  about this victimhood psychology here it is we'll be right back
[2:38:41.320 --> 2:38:44.760]  having me all right now dr levine your latest article
[2:38:44.760 --> 2:38:48.920]  for alternate dot org is titled our americans
[2:38:48.920 --> 2:38:53.720]  a broken people why we've stopped fighting back
[2:38:53.720 --> 2:38:59.560]  against the forces of oppression now explain this a little bit why are in
[2:38:59.560 --> 2:39:03.240]  this piece explain what it means to be a broken people
[2:39:03.240 --> 2:39:05.880]  and can you go through the signs of a broken people
[2:39:05.880 --> 2:39:09.000]  and what would a nation of broken people look like
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:12.920]  i think one sign would be that when people actually know a lot of the
[2:39:12.920 --> 2:39:15.320]  truths about how they're being oppressed so
[2:39:15.320 --> 2:39:19.960]  for example when you have you know a society american society that
[2:39:19.960 --> 2:39:23.560]  it's not the majority depending on what polls you're looking at but certainly a
[2:39:23.560 --> 2:39:26.360]  a significant many millions and probably majority
[2:39:26.360 --> 2:39:30.600]  who don't understand why the heck we're even in these wars that we're in
[2:39:30.600 --> 2:39:37.080]  who a majority of people who want a much more humane health coverage system
[2:39:37.080 --> 2:39:41.400]  if not single-payer at least some healthy public option i mean you have a huge
[2:39:41.400 --> 2:39:45.480]  numbers of people out there who know the truth how they're being oppressed
[2:39:45.480 --> 2:39:50.120]  victimized and they're not acting on that and and that for me
[2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:55.080]  reminds me of a lot of people individuals i know who are for example with
[2:39:55.080 --> 2:39:59.320]  spouses who are emotionally or physically or sexually abusing them
[2:39:59.320 --> 2:40:03.080]  they know their spouses are bad news they're horrible they're oppressive
[2:40:03.080 --> 2:40:06.040]  but they but they can't they feel helpless and hopeless to do something
[2:40:06.040 --> 2:40:09.320]  about that so i think you know the hallmark sign of when you're seeing
[2:40:09.320 --> 2:40:12.120]  somebody in whatever you would want to call it we don't need to use a
[2:40:12.120 --> 2:40:15.880]  psychology jargon you could call it you could just call it a beaten broken
[2:40:15.880 --> 2:40:18.920]  people we don't call it an abusive term you can call it whatever the heck you
[2:40:18.920 --> 2:40:22.120]  want but there's a certain kind of thing that happens when people are
[2:40:22.120 --> 2:40:25.640]  completely disparate that um you know that that more
[2:40:25.640 --> 2:40:28.760]  truths about how they're getting oppressed really are not going to free
[2:40:28.760 --> 2:40:32.600]  them up okay so abuse syndrome is i mean it sounds
[2:40:32.600 --> 2:40:34.920]  a little bit like stockholm syndrome if you will
[2:40:34.920 --> 2:40:38.360]  you know famously uh a situation where the
[2:40:38.360 --> 2:40:42.120]  captor falls in love with the a person who's keeping them hostage
[2:40:42.120 --> 2:40:45.720]  patty uh what's a patty hearst being a famous example of this
[2:40:45.720 --> 2:40:48.520]  so you're saying the entire country the united states is suffering from abuse
[2:40:48.520 --> 2:40:51.480]  syndrome and that the people in charge like obama
[2:40:51.480 --> 2:40:55.160]  and the rest of his crew are like the abuse of pimps or the abuse of spouse
[2:40:55.160 --> 2:40:58.280]  who are just beating their beating the uh the poor
[2:40:58.280 --> 2:41:02.280]  victim who then um becomes completely demoralized
[2:41:02.280 --> 2:41:06.040]  and there's a self-feeding phenomenon and there's a there's an aspect of this
[2:41:06.040 --> 2:41:08.840]  which is very very interesting you say in a recent piece here
[2:41:08.840 --> 2:41:13.720]  can people become so broken that the truths of how they are being screwed
[2:41:13.720 --> 2:41:18.680]  do not quote set them free but instead further demoralize them and the reason
[2:41:18.680 --> 2:41:22.520]  i bring this up is that in the u.s there are media outlets let's
[2:41:22.520 --> 2:41:27.720]  say alice jones who does a job in in in exposing
[2:41:27.720 --> 2:41:31.400]  how americans are getting screwed he does on his side brilliantly
[2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:34.600]  but according to the abuse syndrome you're saying that this is actually
[2:41:34.600 --> 2:41:37.720]  making the situation worse because every time
[2:41:37.720 --> 2:41:42.520]  more abuse is exposed and nothing happens it causes further demoralization
[2:41:42.520 --> 2:41:45.160]  as part of the feedback loop am i getting this correct
[2:41:45.160 --> 2:41:47.880]  yeah i mean a couple of things that one is just like you know the stockholm
[2:41:47.880 --> 2:41:51.160]  syndrome that you mentioned is i don't think that's happening for all americans
[2:41:51.160 --> 2:41:54.760]  i mean that's when that syndrome people actually fall in love with their abusers
[2:41:54.760 --> 2:41:57.800]  i don't i don't think you know that there's a lot of people on the left
[2:41:57.800 --> 2:42:01.720]  who are full who've fallen in love with dick cany and george w bush
[2:42:01.720 --> 2:42:04.920]  although you know i don't know i'm sorry to interrupt but i mean obama has a
[2:42:04.920 --> 2:42:08.200]  cult worshiping crowd they are in love with obama you can do no wrong it's
[2:42:08.200 --> 2:42:10.600]  like the daily right right the daily cost
[2:42:10.600 --> 2:42:14.200]  he can't do any wrong but you're saying that they could be victims of abuse
[2:42:14.200 --> 2:42:18.680]  syndrome right i mean i think the the hallmark of it is that if
[2:42:18.680 --> 2:42:22.760]  if you know somebody is you know giving you know one of the classic things of
[2:42:22.760 --> 2:42:25.960]  somebody who is a an abusive pamper and abusive spouses
[2:42:25.960 --> 2:42:29.560]  that they don't always you know beat the heck out of somebody sometimes they
[2:42:29.560 --> 2:42:33.480]  bring you flowers you know but at bottom if you're being
[2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:36.760]  um not who you are is not being taken seriously
[2:42:36.760 --> 2:42:39.800]  what your needs are not being taken seriously
[2:42:39.800 --> 2:42:44.600]  you know you know and and basically what that what all that's going on on a
[2:42:44.600 --> 2:42:47.640]  regular basis is that person who is in control whether it's a
[2:42:47.640 --> 2:42:51.240]  pimp or a government leader or a boss or whatever
[2:42:51.240 --> 2:42:54.760]  are are exploiting you then you're then you're kind of then you're in an
[2:42:54.760 --> 2:42:59.640]  abused syndrome um and uh people people can claim as you know
[2:42:59.640 --> 2:43:02.680]  and any or i can see almost any anything going on in our
[2:43:02.680 --> 2:43:05.640]  government here in the last 30 years is that people are
[2:43:05.640 --> 2:43:09.400]  are in that kind of a syndrome where they're really getting nothing for their
[2:43:09.400 --> 2:43:12.840]  their taxes here except you know these these militaries that are
[2:43:12.840 --> 2:43:15.960]  that are fighting wars all over the world that most of many many americans
[2:43:15.960 --> 2:43:17.880]  could you know don't even understand what they're doing it
[2:43:17.880 --> 2:43:24.120]  okay you say bringing flowers can be a form of abuse but to be more specific
[2:43:24.120 --> 2:43:28.600]  i think this plays into your your thought about the medicalization of the
[2:43:28.600 --> 2:43:31.160]  abuse syndrome so instead of getting flowers
[2:43:31.160 --> 2:43:34.600]  uh people are getting meds can you speak about this a little bit
[2:43:34.600 --> 2:43:38.920]  yeah i mean i think you know my industry the uh i'm in the mental health
[2:43:38.920 --> 2:43:41.880]  profession here in the u.s. i'm a psychologist and i spend a good part
[2:43:41.880 --> 2:43:46.040]  of that article of confronting what my business my which is that not so much
[2:43:46.040 --> 2:43:49.640]  a profession of business these days and what they've done to contribute and i
[2:43:49.640 --> 2:43:52.920]  think they've they've contributed to the abuse syndrome in many ways they've
[2:43:52.920 --> 2:43:56.760]  taken a lot of our most potentially rebellious and
[2:43:56.760 --> 2:44:00.760]  non-compliant young people out there and labeled them with all kind of
[2:44:00.760 --> 2:44:04.200]  diseases the most obvious being something called oppositional defiant
[2:44:04.200 --> 2:44:08.520]  disorder which is an increasingly popular diagnosis here in the united
[2:44:08.520 --> 2:44:12.040]  states for kids who just argue with adults who refuse to comply with adults
[2:44:12.040 --> 2:44:16.360]  who are stubborn how what yeah i mean i'm not being facetious here i'm not
[2:44:16.360 --> 2:44:18.680]  joking about that that's that's going on and they're
[2:44:18.680 --> 2:44:23.480]  increasingly subject to medicaid drugs and behavior modifications but there's
[2:44:23.480 --> 2:44:26.520]  even a larger group of i think folks who are being
[2:44:26.520 --> 2:44:30.200]  described as mentally ill who are engaged in what i would call more of a
[2:44:30.200 --> 2:44:34.600]  passive rebellion so there's millions of kids out there who are bored in boring
[2:44:34.600 --> 2:44:37.480]  schools who just don't pay attention because it's not interesting for them
[2:44:37.480 --> 2:44:40.360]  they're not getting anything out of it and so they're being labeled with
[2:44:40.360 --> 2:44:44.280]  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and so you got millions more who
[2:44:44.280 --> 2:44:47.240]  were just depressed completely depressed because their lives are
[2:44:47.240 --> 2:44:49.880]  completely alienating they hate what they're doing for a living they're
[2:44:49.880 --> 2:44:52.840]  working on jobs only to hold on to health insurance
[2:44:52.840 --> 2:44:56.040]  um their lives are miserable and so you know they're medicalized with the
[2:44:56.040 --> 2:44:59.320]  mental illness okay that's the first part of the clip the
[2:44:59.320 --> 2:45:04.840]  second part's up on max keiser dot com max my issue is i'm going after
[2:45:04.840 --> 2:45:08.120]  as the doctor i hadn't even seen the clip i just wanted to play it
[2:45:08.120 --> 2:45:12.200]  as he said that everybody is in under this i'm after the people
[2:45:12.200 --> 2:45:15.640]  who didn't know or who were slowly brought into denial
[2:45:15.640 --> 2:45:19.000]  who never really paid attention to the world that kind of just accept what's
[2:45:19.000 --> 2:45:23.080]  put in front of them i'm trying to wake them up or get them to see
[2:45:23.080 --> 2:45:26.840]  what's happening and all we talk about here is solutions
[2:45:26.840 --> 2:45:30.360]  and ideas and ways to counter this but i do get your point of
[2:45:30.360 --> 2:45:34.120]  just exposing it and then people just laying there and taking it
[2:45:34.120 --> 2:45:37.320]  first for a certain percentage of the public it will make it
[2:45:37.320 --> 2:45:41.480]  worse for them they you know they're not given a silver bullet some some easy
[2:45:41.480 --> 2:45:43.960]  one-inch punch because i don't believe that exists
[2:45:43.960 --> 2:45:47.560]  and so they just get deeper in uh to submitting to their pimp
[2:45:47.560 --> 2:45:50.920]  and when he talks about giving them flowers that's like john goddy the teflon
[2:45:50.920 --> 2:45:54.120]  dawn a couple times a year would buy pizzas for the whole neighborhood
[2:45:54.120 --> 2:45:57.960]  fireworks displays uh he would pay for a funeral for somebody
[2:45:57.960 --> 2:46:01.640]  just like the government puts all these billboards up and tv ads and radio ads
[2:46:01.640 --> 2:46:04.440]  of how they're helping us and they're our daddy and
[2:46:04.440 --> 2:46:07.080]  they're the authority and they're going to keep us safe
[2:46:07.080 --> 2:46:10.760]  that is the carrot of the stick max keiser
[2:46:10.760 --> 2:46:13.960]  well the doctor is saying that at some point in the cycle
[2:46:13.960 --> 2:46:17.640]  the truth the truth the people recognize what is
[2:46:17.640 --> 2:46:21.480]  as the truth is making them feel even sicker
[2:46:21.480 --> 2:46:25.640]  and so we don't tell them the truth excuse me so we don't tell people what's
[2:46:25.640 --> 2:46:28.920]  happening well uh that that's the paradox
[2:46:28.920 --> 2:46:34.040]  and um that's that's that's that's no they want to make you depressed
[2:46:34.040 --> 2:46:37.800]  and go that direction so you are broke back broken as he said
[2:46:37.800 --> 2:46:41.560]  and just submit to it i'm saying end the mind control
[2:46:41.560 --> 2:46:48.360]  end the the the literal hoax were under the the the spell the trance were in
[2:46:48.360 --> 2:46:51.160]  well i mean let's take a kid in your face for example
[2:46:51.160 --> 2:46:55.400]  uh your film the obama deception i was one of those people that was reluctant
[2:46:55.400 --> 2:46:58.440]  to accept it then i saw it at some point i saw it as
[2:46:58.440 --> 2:47:03.240]  the truth i made that that transition and and in your
[2:47:03.240 --> 2:47:06.520]  your shows you're now at a point now where it's no longer
[2:47:06.520 --> 2:47:10.120]  so-called conspiracy theories a lot of what you're talking the majority of what
[2:47:10.120 --> 2:47:13.640]  you're talking about now which was dismissed even a year or two ago as
[2:47:13.640 --> 2:47:18.440]  conspiracy theory is now becoming the truth this is not a conspiracy theory
[2:47:18.440 --> 2:47:22.760]  we're winning we're winning well it's being recognized as a truth
[2:47:22.760 --> 2:47:25.240]  okay so that brings us up to the present which is
[2:47:25.240 --> 2:47:28.760]  now what is the action
[2:47:29.080 --> 2:47:34.040]  we beat kopenhagen hold on we expose the flu most people don't take the shot
[2:47:34.040 --> 2:47:37.080]  it's a huge fraud most people know we expose kopenhagen
[2:47:37.080 --> 2:47:41.560]  we expose we're winning i mean the strategy is working
[2:47:41.560 --> 2:47:45.240]  well the truth is being revealed and now the question is
[2:47:45.240 --> 2:47:49.880]  as far as an action goes you're saying that a multi a multi-faceted attack is
[2:47:49.880 --> 2:47:53.240]  what you're thinking about because we're being hit by a multi-faceted
[2:47:53.240 --> 2:47:57.160]  attack okay and i'm my i i'm my thought
[2:47:57.160 --> 2:48:00.760]  is that i i fall into this category let's call it a one-inch punch
[2:48:00.760 --> 2:48:04.680]  or a single thrust and that's my thought you know that mean that's how i tell us
[2:48:04.680 --> 2:48:08.920]  tell us what the one-inch punch is well the one-inch punch in other words
[2:48:08.920 --> 2:48:13.320]  you want to drop somebody with one punch you don't want to be getting into a
[2:48:13.320 --> 2:48:16.280]  fight with that you want to tear their nose off with the first punch so what
[2:48:16.280 --> 2:48:19.560]  is the one-inch punch okay well after looking at every single
[2:48:19.560 --> 2:48:24.120]  company in the united states and if you think about boycott that's the
[2:48:24.120 --> 2:48:30.280]  cheap way to engage activism the only company that is the most vulnerable to
[2:48:30.280 --> 2:48:34.120]  a mass boycott which would cause the one-inch punch effect
[2:48:34.120 --> 2:48:37.320]  and destroy that company within a matter of three months
[2:48:37.320 --> 2:48:41.960]  is coca-cola now you may tell me that well i've got no beef with coca-cola
[2:48:41.960 --> 2:48:44.840]  and i've got no problem with coca-cola but i state to you
[2:48:44.840 --> 2:48:49.640]  that the activist community or the the the active community of listeners to your
[2:48:49.640 --> 2:48:52.840]  show in my show would they would learn that victory then we could do it to
[2:48:52.840 --> 2:48:55.480]  others i say go after the airlines but go ahead
[2:48:55.480 --> 2:48:59.000]  well the problem with the airline is that they're not vulnerable
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:02.280]  to a boycott i did a study and i looked at every single company on the stock
[2:49:02.280 --> 2:49:05.720]  exchange i looked at it from two ways a vulnerability to a boycott which i
[2:49:05.720 --> 2:49:09.000]  determined as the stock price over the
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:11.960]  sales so for every dollar of sales that he was
[2:49:11.960 --> 2:49:16.200]  told from the company it would have the biggest impact on the price of the stock
[2:49:16.200 --> 2:49:20.920]  the airlines do not have a huge uh vulnerability to really they've already
[2:49:20.920 --> 2:49:23.800]  lost a lot of money from people not engaged in terrorism
[2:49:23.800 --> 2:49:26.440]  because of all the garbage but but i mean okay you're the expert on this i'll
[2:49:26.440 --> 2:49:29.880]  believe you so you go to coca-cola how do you go after them
[2:49:29.880 --> 2:49:33.720]  well instead of spreading your back and saying i'm going to
[2:49:33.720 --> 2:49:37.160]  be a part of this group and that group and and this boycott that boycott
[2:49:37.160 --> 2:49:41.880]  every single person who is feeling like the abuse syndrome is kicking them
[2:49:41.880 --> 2:49:44.600]  right now and they're being treated like chattel
[2:49:44.600 --> 2:49:47.960]  in the in the banker's meat grinder of speculation
[2:49:47.960 --> 2:49:51.880]  if everything and that includes probably a hundred million americans or more i
[2:49:51.880 --> 2:49:55.080]  would think anybody who's trying to work for a living
[2:49:55.080 --> 2:49:59.160]  if you simply do not drink coca-cola for three to six to nine months
[2:49:59.160 --> 2:50:03.080]  and you see and he'd take the stock price down to zero and that's key
[2:50:03.080 --> 2:50:06.040]  you know if you're winning because every single day the wall street journal
[2:50:06.040 --> 2:50:09.000]  publishes the stock price if the stock price is going down
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:13.400]  you're winning and the goal is to simply take the price of stock to zero
[2:50:13.400 --> 2:50:15.800]  now of course people will say well what about all the people who work at that
[2:50:15.800 --> 2:50:18.360]  company they're going to lose their job i'm news for you they're going to lose
[2:50:18.360 --> 2:50:21.480]  your job anyway or you're going to be different to mediate out of existence
[2:50:21.480 --> 2:50:25.160]  anyway it's it's beyond trying to finesse the situation
[2:50:25.160 --> 2:50:29.240]  now we have to show them that we can drop them to the to the mat
[2:50:29.240 --> 2:50:33.160]  with a single punch coke is the most vulnerable is the most vulnerable to
[2:50:33.160 --> 2:50:36.120]  boycott and i've done the study on this and this is
[2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:41.160]  the company that is the one well you got to have a reason to boycott them on
[2:50:41.160 --> 2:50:44.360]  the surface and that would be putting aspartame
[2:50:44.360 --> 2:50:48.440]  the feces of bacteria in the coke and for those that don't know that's how they
[2:50:48.440 --> 2:50:52.840]  make aspartame they feed toxic waste to genetically engineered ecoli
[2:50:52.840 --> 2:50:55.720]  they feed toxic waste to genetically engineered ecoli

[2:56:08.440 --> 2:56:11.640]  economic numbers coming in as you've been saying several years on this show
[2:56:11.640 --> 2:56:16.120]  and many years on your own television shows that
[2:56:16.120 --> 2:56:19.560]  the banks are vertically integrating the economy this is a criminal operation
[2:56:19.560 --> 2:56:23.560]  you talk about Goldman Sachs execs and that bar bragging to you how they were
[2:56:23.560 --> 2:56:28.120]  going to bring down that atlantic country of
[2:56:28.120 --> 2:56:31.720]  iceland and retrovec when you were there
[2:56:31.720 --> 2:56:35.720]  and then we have a five-part series of mclatchy newspapers where Goldman Sachs
[2:56:35.720 --> 2:56:39.080]  was engineering the housing implosion while telling their people to buy into
[2:56:39.080 --> 2:56:42.520]  it to consolidate destroy their competition that's now confirmed
[2:56:42.520 --> 2:56:45.560]  us growth prospects deemed bleak in new decade
[2:56:45.560 --> 2:56:49.400]  Reuters personal bankruptcy filings rising fast record levels
[2:56:49.400 --> 2:56:52.600]  robert rubin now posing as the saver when he's one of the grand architects
[2:56:52.600 --> 2:56:55.960]  saying all hell could break loose if we don't fix our government debt they want
[2:56:55.960 --> 2:56:58.600]  all these new taxes they have glimb back calling for it
[2:56:58.600 --> 2:57:01.640]  you're a liberal commie if you're not for more taxes
[2:57:01.640 --> 2:57:04.600]  again they can only have obama launch wars as a liberal
[2:57:04.600 --> 2:57:08.120]  and only have fake conservatives call for new taxes that's how this
[2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:12.120]  song and dance works american job satisfaction falls a record low
[2:57:12.120 --> 2:57:17.960]  worst christmas since 1979 your comments on that quickly max keiser
[2:57:17.960 --> 2:57:21.400]  well uh the decade of the 1930s the depression
[2:57:21.400 --> 2:57:25.960]  at the end of the decade the market still managed to make 10 percent
[2:57:25.960 --> 2:57:30.440]  including reinvestment of all dividends the decade that just ended the total
[2:57:30.440 --> 2:57:35.720]  return was a whopping zero um now the problem is that you can't
[2:57:35.720 --> 2:57:39.640]  have capitalism without capital and you can't have capital
[2:57:39.640 --> 2:57:43.080]  unless people are saving money and people can't save money
[2:57:43.080 --> 2:57:47.000]  unless they have jobs that pay them enough to save money
[2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:50.600]  so unless that happens which is not going to happen because
[2:57:50.600 --> 2:57:53.480]  all the policies are geared toward making it easier for the banks to
[2:57:53.480 --> 2:57:58.120]  speculate and speculating is not a job speculating is a vice
[2:57:58.120 --> 2:58:01.800]  when it's done on the level is being done on wall street and is being
[2:58:01.800 --> 2:58:05.960]  helped along by washington so the business model of america is vice
[2:58:05.960 --> 2:58:10.040]  its speculation is casino and the people getting victimized are being put into
[2:58:10.040 --> 2:58:13.640]  this american gulag and whether you're being how about this one
[2:58:13.640 --> 2:58:17.400]  prisoners used to shovel snowbound u.s capital

[2:58:21.720 --> 2:58:25.160]  washington post you can't hire americans to do it
[2:58:25.160 --> 2:58:28.440]  they said they paid them seven dollars an hour but 80 percent of that was given
[2:58:28.440 --> 2:58:32.040]  to the prison that's what i'm talking about it's slave labor
[2:58:32.040 --> 2:58:35.640]  they're in the gulag so they let the gulag people out for a few hours to

[3:02:14.360 --> 3:02:17.800]  and basically he's eating the product of his own

[3:09:09.720 --> 3:09:14.040]  information that i got like 15 years ago and it's
[3:09:14.040 --> 3:09:18.920]  i agree with max it's like alex in wonderland everything is coming true
[3:09:18.920 --> 3:09:24.760]  now my question to you is uh is your program on the radio here

[3:09:27.880 --> 3:09:33.800]  wish to say the merry i believe i'm only on one station in north carolina

[3:09:37.880 --> 3:09:40.280]  not we're number one on the internet we're also in
[3:09:40.280 --> 3:09:43.320]  w w c r but no the best place to get it for everybody
[3:09:43.320 --> 3:09:46.760]  is the free podcast we deliver one hour after the show every day all four hours
[3:09:46.760 --> 3:09:50.200]  free and high quality just go to the listen section of info wars dot

[3:09:58.600 --> 3:10:05.320]  on w w c r as well saturdays they rear four hours of the friday show on xm radio
[3:10:05.320 --> 3:10:08.280]  and that's a test they've been doing for a year they know it gets high ratings
[3:10:08.280 --> 3:10:13.160]  but they're scared of it uh but anything else marvin
[3:10:13.160 --> 3:10:19.000]  yeah um i have a female friend that is a that is an obama lover in conjunction
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:22.280]  with the fact i think she's actually suffering from a
[3:10:22.280 --> 3:10:25.480]  Stockholm syndrome i learned about that in the military
[3:10:25.480 --> 3:10:31.640]  and um you know i've been told by some constituents of mine where if you're
[3:10:31.640 --> 3:10:35.080]  going to deal with you're going to have to help wake her up or otherwise you
[3:10:35.080 --> 3:10:40.040]  know you're not doing your job so uh any recommendation
[3:10:40.040 --> 3:10:43.320]  marvin let me get a recommendation from max keiser what's the best way to wake
[3:10:43.320 --> 3:10:46.840]  somebody up that doesn't want to be awake
[3:10:46.840 --> 3:10:53.000]  obama is to violence with tiger wood is to sex
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:56.840]  yeah well i think i think the tiger would say that's most mostly a smear
[3:10:56.840 --> 3:11:00.040]  campaign it's a distraction no but i mean he's saying
[3:11:00.040 --> 3:11:03.080]  tiger woods is to sex with obama is to violence
[3:11:03.080 --> 3:11:07.640]  i mean obama is there to con liberals just like bush was there to con
[3:11:07.640 --> 3:11:11.240]  conservatives these are madison avenue produced creatures
[3:11:11.240 --> 3:11:16.040]  who have no power and so point out to her that he broke all his promises
[3:11:16.040 --> 3:11:19.160]  marvin i appreciate your call go through some of the promises max from your own
[3:11:19.160 --> 3:11:22.840]  view that obama has broken royally
[3:11:22.840 --> 3:11:26.280]  well it's just the repeal of a lot of the things that bush did i thought when
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:30.200]  he got into office he was going to repeal a lot of those
[3:11:30.200 --> 3:11:33.960]  policies that bush into place in terms of extraordinary rendition
[3:11:33.960 --> 3:11:37.560]  torture kidnapping i thought he would repeal them but not only has he not
[3:11:37.560 --> 3:11:41.160]  repealed them but he's made them more onerous and more restrictive so he's
[3:11:41.160 --> 3:11:43.800]  actually doing a lot worse he's just taking a
[3:11:43.800 --> 3:11:47.560]  ball and run with it and made it a lot worse
[3:11:47.560 --> 3:11:51.640]  yeah things have gotten worse and he'll get worse under the republican savior
[3:11:51.640 --> 3:11:57.800]  coming in three years well because the hall of policy you know you've got a
[3:11:57.800 --> 3:12:01.640]  government's been captured by the professional speculators on wall street
[3:12:01.640 --> 3:12:04.120]  and they wanted their objective the business yes
[3:12:04.120 --> 3:12:08.520]  is to get cheap money and not to have to pay for any of their losing bets
[3:12:08.520 --> 3:12:13.640]  marvin what you do is you explain to her that obama works for the very same
[3:12:13.640 --> 3:12:17.400]  bankers that ran clinton that ran bush you can give them the names
[3:12:17.400 --> 3:12:22.120]  and that it's the same system and that she needs to get past the puppets
[3:12:22.120 --> 3:12:26.520]  and to the real power behind the throne it's that simple take her behind the
[3:12:26.520 --> 3:12:29.800]  stage behind the curtain behind the movie screen
[3:12:29.800 --> 3:12:33.640]  omar in illinois you're on the air hey uh... alex
[3:12:33.640 --> 3:12:36.840]  uh... yes it's all your hard work on first-time caller
[3:12:36.840 --> 3:12:41.320]  uh... welcome thanks for infiltrating bohemian grove uh... that woke my
[3:12:41.320 --> 3:12:45.000]  brother up to the new order by the way awesome
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:49.160]  and uh... thanks to uh... thanks to you max kaiser for your hard work on my
[3:12:49.160 --> 3:12:52.920]  um... i heard you say that uh... our dollar was going to become like toilet
[3:12:52.920 --> 3:12:55.480]  paper uh... for the everyday man
[3:12:55.480 --> 3:12:58.920]  what would you advise like if you only had a couple thousand to work with what
[3:12:58.920 --> 3:13:01.080]  would you advise me to do because i'm worried about
[3:13:01.080 --> 3:13:05.720]  the economic collapse and those hyperinflation what would you advise
[3:13:05.720 --> 3:13:10.280]  well okay i don't give i'm not giving interest advice but i will tell you that
[3:13:10.280 --> 3:13:14.920]  the obvious uh... obvious play here is that everything all the currencies
[3:13:14.920 --> 3:13:17.960]  including the u.s. dollar are going to be
[3:13:17.960 --> 3:13:23.320]  deflating against gold bullion and i would buy gold bullion
[3:13:23.320 --> 3:13:27.560]  not you know outside of the united states gold money dot com
[3:13:27.560 --> 3:13:30.440]  is the only place that i know of the best place that i know of where you can
[3:13:30.440 --> 3:13:35.560]  actually buy gold bullion and have it being held outside of the united states
[3:13:35.560 --> 3:13:40.120]  well max my issue is is that i don't hold paper certificates in gold
[3:13:40.120 --> 3:13:43.720]  i don't put my gold in some faraway vault in another country i know you think
[3:13:43.720 --> 3:13:47.720]  it's safe to not be grabbed overseas but look what's happening in the swiss
[3:13:47.720 --> 3:13:51.160]  uh... and and and all those bank accounts and things being grabbed
[3:13:51.160 --> 3:13:54.360]  uh... i'll tell you where i get my gold and physically hold its modest resources
[3:13:54.360 --> 3:13:56.440]  dot com but regardless i agree with you
[3:13:56.440 --> 3:14:00.200]  gold is the place for people to invest thank you so much
[3:14:00.200 --> 3:14:04.680]  omar in illinois but but briefly what will it look like as the dollar
[3:14:04.680 --> 3:14:07.960]  which they've gone from debating should we get rid of it
[3:14:07.960 --> 3:14:13.560]  to how will we get rid of it how do you see that process of the slow death of
[3:14:13.560 --> 3:14:16.840]  the dollar or will it be a fast death it's been a slow death but
[3:14:16.840 --> 3:14:21.000]  steadily down how do you see that taking place
[3:14:21.000 --> 3:14:24.920]  well i think we're seeing it happen right now with the imf is very active in
[3:14:24.920 --> 3:14:27.160]  europe right now with the special drawing rights
[3:14:27.160 --> 3:14:32.280]  which are a composite or a the currency that's really an accounting entry in
[3:14:32.280 --> 3:14:36.360]  book form and they are getting ready to do a recalibration
[3:14:36.360 --> 3:14:40.520]  of the global currency grid and everything will be exchanged into
[3:14:40.520 --> 3:14:44.040]  the special drawing rights at a ratio that will
[3:14:44.040 --> 3:14:48.280]  quote-unquote rebalance the global economy and by at some point in 2010 this
[3:14:48.280 --> 3:14:51.560]  is going to become a big issue you can say the global economy is completely
[3:14:51.560 --> 3:14:55.080]  unbalanced the banks start lending them on how much money we give them
[3:14:55.080 --> 3:14:58.920]  and china keeps making all these profits and hoarding all their dollars
[3:14:58.920 --> 3:15:02.600]  so we need to get together and we need to rebalance the global economy which
[3:15:02.600 --> 3:15:05.320]  means that all the major fiat currencies are going to be thrown into a
[3:15:05.320 --> 3:15:08.840]  special drawing right and then spilled back out at a ratio
[3:15:08.840 --> 3:15:12.840]  that'll quote-unquote rebalance the economy the biggest loser in that
[3:15:12.840 --> 3:15:17.720]  scenario is the u.s dollar by far it's going to take a haircut
[3:15:17.720 --> 3:15:21.320]  of between 30 and 40 similar to the haircut it took
[3:15:21.320 --> 3:15:25.880]  under fdr it took a 40 percent haircut as a way to
[3:15:25.880 --> 3:15:29.480]  to revalue the dollar and i would anticipate something like that again
[3:15:29.480 --> 3:15:32.120]  and coming soon
[3:15:32.120 --> 3:15:36.520]  all right let's quickly take another call here let's talk to david and
[3:15:36.520 --> 3:15:39.400]  washington you're on the air with max keiser go ahead
[3:15:39.400 --> 3:15:45.560]  hey alex how are you good good um you know you were talking about russia
[3:15:45.560 --> 3:15:49.480]  today and you know how it covers news that american media won't cover
[3:15:49.480 --> 3:15:53.640]  and you know i was talking to my parents and they you know they came from russia
[3:15:53.640 --> 3:15:58.040]  too and they say you know um they they understand
[3:15:58.040 --> 3:16:01.640]  what is happening they they went through the same exact thing
[3:16:01.640 --> 3:16:05.720]  with their communists you know my mom was just laughing the other day saying
[3:16:05.720 --> 3:16:11.400]  you know we came here we ran away from the system and we just we came back to
[3:16:11.400 --> 3:16:14.680]  the system here in america
[3:16:15.560 --> 3:16:19.640]  but it's a more high-tech version i appreciate your call uh comments on that
[3:16:19.640 --> 3:16:23.560]  max well it's amazing that america seems
[3:16:23.560 --> 3:16:28.200]  that they have to censor ads from russia today and they don't have enough faith
[3:16:28.200 --> 3:16:31.640]  in their own population to be able to sort through what they
[3:16:31.640 --> 3:16:35.960]  feel is uh material that is uh not in their
[3:16:35.960 --> 3:16:39.640]  interest and so the the federal government is saying we know we don't
[3:16:39.640 --> 3:16:44.040]  even want you to be exposed to anything we want total control of the total
[3:16:44.040 --> 3:16:47.800]  global media uh footprint which is of course the
[3:16:47.800 --> 3:16:51.400]  hallmark of an empire and let's get down to brass tacks out
[3:16:51.400 --> 3:16:55.080]  the reason why algae they're english and russia today are not
[3:16:55.080 --> 3:17:00.200]  you know are they're seen by the fox news and the cnbc that's competition
[3:17:00.200 --> 3:17:03.720]  and just like the banks are wall street in other parts of the economy they
[3:17:03.720 --> 3:17:06.680]  don't want competition and they don't want russia today they don't want algae
[3:17:06.680 --> 3:17:09.320]  or english they don't want to compete with anybody they want a monopoly they
[3:17:09.320 --> 3:17:11.880]  want all the viewers they want to say what they want to say without getting
[3:17:11.880 --> 3:17:16.040]  challenged in any way over there at fox news and let me say this algae zero
[3:17:16.040 --> 3:17:21.240]  got big by being a little more open but once they got big they've gotten his
[3:17:21.240 --> 3:17:25.800]  mainline as fox news in my opinion now and seeing in
[3:17:25.800 --> 3:17:29.400]  russia today is being super radical exposing their own government our
[3:17:29.400 --> 3:17:32.280]  government i can't believe the stuff that's on there
[3:17:32.280 --> 3:17:35.880]  it's as if i'm programming it or something it's it's just amazing
[3:17:35.880 --> 3:17:40.120]  uh and let's hope that once they get the giant market share
[3:17:40.120 --> 3:17:43.080]  because they they're smart that they continue with what they've been doing
[3:17:43.080 --> 3:17:46.840]  because i remember bill o'reilly 10 years ago he was having
[3:17:46.840 --> 3:17:52.120]  tony brown on uh of a of a tony brown's journal talking about the
[3:17:52.120 --> 3:17:56.520]  illuminati in the new world order so he built his audience i mean did you see
[3:17:56.520 --> 3:17:59.400]  o'reilly 10 12 years ago it was like anti new world order
[3:17:59.400 --> 3:18:03.320]  he built that giant audience giving people what they want the truth
[3:18:03.320 --> 3:18:06.360]  and then but he only did it for two years and then flip flopped and then
[3:18:06.360 --> 3:18:09.720]  just gets worse and worse and now he says you're a dirty communist if you
[3:18:09.720 --> 3:18:12.200]  don't want more taxes i mean you know it's sick
[3:18:12.200 --> 3:18:15.960]  well giving another huge flip flop which is you know amazing
[3:18:15.960 --> 3:18:21.080]  is uh you know bono from the uh group u2 he wants total internet police state
[3:18:21.080 --> 3:18:25.160]  yeah like china he holds china up as an example
[3:18:25.160 --> 3:18:29.480]  you know and this is like my site pirate my film is meant to challenge
[3:18:29.480 --> 3:18:34.760]  this whole bono thought that you know the copyright needs to be protected for
[3:18:34.760 --> 3:18:38.440]  perpetuity that is that's like giving the population
[3:18:38.440 --> 3:18:43.960]  an intellectual um you know uh lobotomy by having copyright extended
[3:18:43.960 --> 3:18:47.320]  indefinitely copyright has to live and breathe has to go back into the public
[3:18:47.320 --> 3:18:52.360]  domain every i believe every 20 years not lifetime plus 70 years as it is now
[3:18:52.360 --> 3:18:55.480]  and it keeps getting extended every time mickey mouse is set to enter the
[3:18:55.480 --> 3:18:59.320]  public domain disney says lobbyist to washington to extend copyright that's
[3:18:59.320 --> 3:19:02.760]  max we're out of max we're out of time incredible interview look forward to
[3:19:02.760 --> 3:19:05.240]  talking to you again soon being on your russia today
[3:19:05.240 --> 3:19:08.520]  uh tv show it was good being on the british show and others
[3:19:08.520 --> 3:19:11.720]  uh and in the last 30 seconds i hope everybody gets
[3:19:11.720 --> 3:19:14.680]  followed republic on dvd you're a big part of the film
[3:19:14.680 --> 3:19:17.640]  a lot of people think you're the most powerful part what do you think of fall
[3:19:17.640 --> 3:19:21.480]  the republic i think the people who consider me to be the
[3:19:21.480 --> 3:19:25.400]  most powerful powerful part of the film are absolutely right
[3:19:25.400 --> 3:19:29.000]  but what do you think of the documentary itself i think it's a great
[3:19:29.000 --> 3:19:32.280]  follow-up to the obama deception you know if you if you watch those two films
[3:19:32.280 --> 3:19:34.440]  together if you have the time to sit down and watch
[3:19:34.440 --> 3:19:38.600]  obama deception fall republic is the one two punch that's all you need to know

[3:24:49.080 --> 3:24:54.280]  and schools and shopping malls and bus terminals and train terminals of america
[3:24:55.640 --> 3:25:01.160]  seven years ago homeland security newly sworn in director governor rich had a two-hour symposium
[3:25:01.160 --> 3:25:06.520]  on c-span that i happened to cross at home and i've done of course countless amounts of research

[3:26:13.960 --> 3:26:18.840]  effects according to scientific reports we're going to go over they record a digital biometric
[3:26:18.840 --> 3:26:22.840]  image of your body just like your thumbprint or your face scan it's even more accurate to have
[3:26:22.840 --> 3:26:28.440]  your body 360 scanned then they keep that in a database just like they've now declassified
[3:26:28.440 --> 3:26:33.880]  14 years after i first broke it that all babies for 37 years in the western world under a secret
[3:26:33.880 --> 3:26:40.760]  un genome project have had their blood taken at birth in fact google that article out of the

[3:26:55.320 --> 3:27:01.320]  blurred images there's so many facets i'm going to try to cover it but first how many reports
[3:27:01.320 --> 3:27:08.120]  have you seen on the news of women being forced to drink their own breast milk when it's in a
[3:27:08.120 --> 3:27:13.000]  baby bottle for them first you're not supposed to breastfeed on a plane that it freaks people out
[3:27:13.000 --> 3:27:17.960]  but the naked body scanners are good everything natural is bad everything unnatural and evil is
[3:27:17.960 --> 3:27:27.240]  good how many people do they beat to death and taser to death in airports in hawaii baby detained

[3:27:46.840 --> 3:27:51.080]  they start questioning you they create a no-fly list now they have bills to make it a no-buy list
[3:27:51.080 --> 3:27:55.800]  where they secretly put you on a list over a million americans 25 000 a month put on it
[3:27:55.800 --> 3:28:03.560]  but every time there's a real terrorist who's even on it they let them in so we have that going on
[3:28:05.480 --> 3:28:09.720]  and then they start having you take your shoes off and your belt off and untuck your shirt
[3:28:09.720 --> 3:28:14.280]  and open up your laptop and tell them what's on your computer tsa announced two years ago they
[3:28:14.280 --> 3:28:18.600]  would start seizing computers randomly and downloading their contents without warrants

[3:29:20.680 --> 3:29:25.400]  scanners he wasn't put through them he didn't have a passport the underwear bomber was led

[3:33:10.760 --> 3:33:15.720]  lines i'm going to do about a 10 minute analysis and breakdown of the body scanners that i want to
[3:33:15.720 --> 3:33:22.040]  hear specifically from callers on their ideas to boycott the airlines the government ways to stop
[3:33:22.040 --> 3:33:27.400]  this what you're doing to expose it to warn people until the end of the transmission
[3:33:30.680 --> 3:33:38.600]  now the london independent reported and they've had top security experts on the headline is our
[3:33:38.600 --> 3:33:45.160]  planned airport scanners just a scam new technology that gordon brown relies on for his response to
[3:33:45.160 --> 3:33:50.600]  the christmas day bomb attack has been tested and found wanting the explosive device smuggled in the
[3:33:50.600 --> 3:33:55.240]  clothing of the detroit bomb suspect would not have been detected by body scanners set to be
[3:33:55.240 --> 3:34:01.080]  introduced in british airports an expert on the technology warned last night and again i will
[3:34:01.080 --> 3:34:07.400]  state the key mainstream television and newspapers cannot show you the real images there are thousands
[3:34:07.400 --> 3:34:14.120]  of them online put out by the security companies you can see every hair every freckle every fold
[3:34:14.120 --> 3:34:19.000]  of the male and female genitalia put it back on screen for people and we have two key articles
[3:34:19.000 --> 3:34:25.000]  written by paul watson today that are up on prison planet dot com alex jones calls for mass
[3:34:25.000 --> 3:34:30.920]  resistance to implementation of body scanners and of course airport set to become primary
[3:34:30.920 --> 3:34:37.960]  peddlers of child porn and we show you what the scanners really do and you need to show everybody
[3:34:37.960 --> 3:34:42.840]  you know it's one thing that you know about this taking action is what empowers you and what gives
[3:34:42.840 --> 3:34:47.080]  us victories just like we had over the global governance formation in copenhagen just like
[3:34:47.080 --> 3:34:52.760]  we had over the flu that whole fear mongering event has been a complete defeat for the enemy
[3:34:53.640 --> 3:34:56.920]  all the evidence and lawsuits and their attempts in new york and
[3:34:56.920 --> 3:35:02.040]  then massachusetts to make it law to make you take the shot failed they tried to set that
[3:35:02.040 --> 3:35:05.880]  precedent they failed and if you take action they will fail again
[3:35:08.600 --> 3:35:12.040]  now there's another key story we posted at prison planet dot com and i've seen countless
[3:35:12.040 --> 3:35:15.880]  reports the last two years from universities and top scientists were lining a bunch of them
[3:35:15.880 --> 3:35:21.720]  up for the show full body scanners to fry travelers with radiation the studies show
[3:35:21.720 --> 3:35:29.640]  that the x-ray type radiation is high-powered and can break up the dna strands in the body
[3:35:29.640 --> 3:35:34.120]  no kidding it's also dangerous for the operators that run these systems but again i just showed
[3:35:34.120 --> 3:35:39.000]  you that photo of the naked woman in the body scanner they always show the images on the news
[3:35:39.000 --> 3:35:44.200]  of someone with a gun or a knife with these scans the image is everyone that scanned is guilty
[3:35:44.200 --> 3:35:51.720]  that's the subconscious image that is put out there i also want to add that the new body
[3:35:51.720 --> 3:35:56.520]  scanners break child porn laws in england and clearly in the us and the london guardian and
[3:35:56.520 --> 3:36:02.200]  the government admits that here's the article from the guardian new scanners break child porn
[3:36:02.200 --> 3:36:08.600]  laws now remember this article i covered on sunday show microsoft seeks patent for office spy
[3:36:08.600 --> 3:36:15.960]  software where everyone will wear a bracelet that tracks their heart rate their mood a earpiece
[3:36:15.960 --> 3:36:21.640]  that tracks their brainwaves this is medicalizing everything making everyone be medically listed
[3:36:21.640 --> 3:36:27.800]  for something they want to make all new cars i saw this six years ago gm toyota with a digital
[3:36:28.360 --> 3:36:33.320]  camera scanner that picks up signs in the face of your tired it will dial the cell phone in the
[3:36:33.320 --> 3:36:39.080]  on-star system and call police to come arrest you i know people arrest and charge with dw i like
[3:36:39.080 --> 3:36:44.120]  crimes all over the country i know people personally in austin for the cops saying they're tired you
[3:36:44.120 --> 3:36:49.720]  get off work at four a.m they say hey you're tired yeah i'm tired boom handcuffs making everybody a
[3:36:49.720 --> 3:36:58.360]  criminal also these are similar radiation to ct scans cat scans they're putting in airports
[3:36:58.360 --> 3:37:03.960]  passive brain scanners at a distance that pick up your brainwaves uh that's been done in multiple
[3:37:03.960 --> 3:37:11.480]  airports around the us in europe since 2002 cbs news also reports new focus on danger of ct scans
[3:37:12.440 --> 3:37:17.640]  again we mentioned how church often others are making millions of dollars a piece billions total
[3:37:17.640 --> 3:37:22.600]  off of as the head of homeland security and the new head of homeland security ordering these when
[3:37:22.600 --> 3:37:29.720]  they're also invested in the companies that's in the boston globe as well meanwhile the tsa is
[3:37:29.720 --> 3:37:35.720]  countering washington post tries to assuage privacy concerns about full body scans already
[3:37:35.720 --> 3:37:42.440]  shoeless beltless it has come to this and waterless more beleaguered air passengers will be holding
[3:37:42.440 --> 3:37:48.040]  their legs apart raising their arms and effectively bearing it all as they pass through us airport
[3:37:48.040 --> 3:37:52.360]  security checkpoints for the full body scan and notice they could have you put your hands out
[3:37:52.360 --> 3:37:58.120]  or out and down to get the scan it's hands up the symbol of i submit i'm a criminal that's the
[3:37:58.120 --> 3:38:03.480]  psychological message there and so they're now trying to say oh we're protecting you oh we're
[3:38:03.480 --> 3:38:12.120]  taking care of you oh we've enslaved you for your own good obama's playing the part of the big daddy
[3:38:12.120 --> 3:38:17.400]  out there saving us doing this for all our own good he gee he doesn't want it to happen but they've
[3:38:17.400 --> 3:38:22.280]  got top us generals i've got two articles on that on the news the last two days saying an
[3:38:22.280 --> 3:38:27.480]  airliner will be blown up in the next hundred days we will be hit by terrorists you better give up all
[3:38:27.480 --> 3:38:35.400]  your rights continuing here i'm going to keep putting that image of the naked woman in the scanner
[3:38:35.400 --> 3:38:40.600]  cutting to another tsa photo of a woman in the scanner with the man looking at the scanner of
[3:38:40.600 --> 3:38:49.000]  her naked body with a smile on his face a picture does tell a million words not a thousand continuing
[3:38:50.360 --> 3:38:54.920]  they are isolating us all they are training us to be hopeless they are training us to submit to
[3:38:54.920 --> 3:39:02.600]  them they are training us incrementally no water no milk no baby food no shampoo take your belt off
[3:39:02.600 --> 3:39:07.240]  take your shoes off all acts of submission now you have to put your hands in your lap on the
[3:39:07.240 --> 3:39:13.400]  flight can't put a blanket over your lap there's national events if somebody has diarrhea in the
[3:39:13.400 --> 3:39:19.320]  head on the airplanes obama's notified of a man in there for 20 minutes defecating again just this
[3:39:19.320 --> 3:39:26.120]  culture of fear and and everybody's scared and only big brother can save us as they profit off of
[3:39:26.120 --> 3:39:31.000]  the control systems not only at the top but all these blue collar workers that can't get jobs
[3:39:31.000 --> 3:39:36.520]  now can get jobs in the tsa which admits they're rolling out nationwide in england as well with
[3:39:36.520 --> 3:39:43.480]  mobile body scanners pulling up to bars forcing everyone through it arresting people for no reason
[3:39:43.480 --> 3:39:48.840]  there was austin case fears ago and it goes all over texas where they come into one case the
[3:39:48.840 --> 3:39:53.160]  radison hotel the guy was a business traveler they watched him drink three beers at the counter
[3:39:53.160 --> 3:39:57.800]  they arrested him for intoxication when he was at a hotel didn't even have a car again all about
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:06.360]  getting us in the system making everyone a criminal conditioning us to accept all of this abuse
[3:40:06.360 --> 3:40:11.000]  setting up the face scanning cameras the license plate reading cameras they biometrically scan
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:15.400]  you with this body scanning system now they can with passive scanners on the streets already going
[3:40:15.400 --> 3:40:20.760]  in shoot through your clothes and get your true identity because they match the scan with your
[3:40:20.760 --> 3:40:26.680]  personal id when you go through the plane when you go through the checkpoint so again mass
[3:40:26.680 --> 3:40:31.560]  humiliation mass public humiliation the tsa employs themselves unless they hired the most
[3:40:31.560 --> 3:40:36.280]  horrible criminals like homeland security has for their private prisons and like the pentagon
[3:40:36.280 --> 3:40:41.400]  hired jail guards with histories of rape and abuse that came out to run abu gaib and hundreds of
[3:40:41.400 --> 3:40:46.680]  other camps around the world who like to rape people the sexualization of torture that all
[3:40:46.680 --> 3:40:51.080]  came out all the torture based around raping people's children in front of them the army's own
[3:40:51.080 --> 3:40:57.080]  report general to goomba's own report that pull up armies report on torture msnbc general to goomba
[3:40:57.080 --> 3:41:00.760]  put that on screen people won't believe it raping children with battery acid raping children in
[3:41:00.760 --> 3:41:07.240]  front of their parents you go read the army's own report okay so we have all of that going on we
[3:41:07.240 --> 3:41:12.360]  need to discuss how we boycott them the most successful and focus way to do it i will not
[3:41:12.360 --> 3:41:17.720]  be taking any pleasure flights i never do anyways i never allowed my children to fly because stuff
[3:41:17.720 --> 3:41:23.800]  like this could happen uh they could be taser they could be killed anything but you need to cut back
[3:41:23.800 --> 3:41:29.080]  on business do do more teleconferencing let the airlines know every time you don't fly you did it
[3:41:29.080 --> 3:41:34.520]  because of this because here's the key to the legalese they say it's a privilege to drive a car
[3:41:35.560 --> 3:41:40.840]  they say it's a privilege to fly a privilege to own a gun all of that is a lie in the 1920s heavy
[3:41:40.840 --> 3:41:46.360]  trucks began to drive on the roads so they went to people in new jersey and new york state and said
[3:41:46.360 --> 3:41:50.200]  don't you want to tax on these truckers making all this money the public said oh yes we don't
[3:41:50.200 --> 3:41:55.240]  want them making money we're greedy you know they played that psychological divide and conquer tactic
[3:41:55.240 --> 3:42:00.760]  and so they made truckers get a license then by the fifties everybody had to get a paper license
[3:42:00.760 --> 3:42:05.320]  now they put points on it now they restrict it now it's now it's a national id card to the real
[3:42:05.320 --> 3:42:10.760]  id act now they have a hemispheric north american union id card you can get to travel in north america
[3:42:10.760 --> 3:42:19.240]  we're already going into the system commerce on the roads they've passed laws is a privilege to go
[3:42:19.240 --> 3:42:24.040]  get a commercial driver's license not to get the regular license but same thing with the airports
[3:42:24.040 --> 3:42:31.160]  they go into the big airport companies government paid for government facilities with private
[3:42:31.160 --> 3:42:37.160]  contracts they go to the big private airlines notice uh private aviation general aviation
[3:42:37.160 --> 3:42:41.960]  private jets private sesnes lear jets they don't have to do this it's because it deals
[3:42:41.960 --> 3:42:46.840]  made with the private corporations they gave the airlines 25 billion in 2002 as the payoff
[3:42:46.840 --> 3:42:53.160]  to agree to all of this they give them billions more each year they pay them to lobby and to accept
[3:42:53.160 --> 3:42:58.680]  saying it's our policy and the feds come in out of their jurisdiction taking over the airports as
[3:42:58.680 --> 3:43:03.560]  their jurisdiction unlawfully and make you go through all these different screening procedures
[3:43:03.560 --> 3:43:09.720]  and and naked body scanners now do you see how they're operating do you see how they're getting
[3:43:09.720 --> 3:43:17.000]  away with this because they make the deal with the airlines to force you to do it then the tsa
[3:43:17.000 --> 3:43:22.840]  expands to the trains to the malls to the streets they have tsa viper teams in houston running
[3:43:22.840 --> 3:43:28.200]  checkpoints in miami florida in new york city suddenly at new year's eve events in la in new
[3:43:28.200 --> 3:43:33.000]  york and all over the place troops regular troops are out there troop checkpoints national
[3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:38.200]  guards searching people winding them just more and more conditioning more and more bringing you into
[3:43:38.200 --> 3:43:48.360]  this and remember the amsterdam airport had the body scanners until we have a broken people
[3:43:48.360 --> 3:43:54.200]  through the stock home syndrome that submit to this and if you'll submit to naked body scanners
[3:43:54.200 --> 3:43:57.400]  and knowing your family's being recorded and knowing you're being biometrically scanned
[3:43:57.400 --> 3:44:03.960]  you'll put up with anything meanwhile we have all the billboards and all the tv ads and radio ads
[3:44:03.960 --> 3:44:08.600]  and propaganda placement in the dramas on television and these news programs about how
[3:44:08.600 --> 3:44:14.520]  tortures good secret arrest is good sexual abuse is good did you guys find the msnbc armies report
[3:44:14.520 --> 3:44:19.400]  on torture general to goomba yeah i want it up i want to show people i don't want to just say
[3:44:19.400 --> 3:44:22.680]  something i want them to see it i know it's real but they need to be faced with it
[3:44:25.080 --> 3:44:28.360]  so all of this is how the governments are big daddy they're going to take care of
[3:44:28.360 --> 3:44:32.040]  us they're the boss literally half the billboards when i drove to dallas interviewed david must
[3:44:32.040 --> 3:44:35.960]  take a mega death half the billboards were reporting legal guns report child abuse the
[3:44:35.960 --> 3:44:40.840]  government cares about you flashing billboards about a grandma who's got Alzheimer's always
[3:44:40.840 --> 3:44:44.840]  meant to sound reasonable now suddenly the billboards are saying report terrorist reporting
[3:44:44.840 --> 3:44:52.280]  legal guns now they're putting out the orwellian running man type messages so again if they tried
[3:44:52.280 --> 3:44:57.960]  to make tsa people actually take women children in and strip them people would physically realize
[3:44:57.960 --> 3:45:04.440]  how abusive this is but by having the instrumentality of a machine a quackery it has this scientific
[3:45:04.440 --> 3:45:11.240]  glow to it like it's okay of the man is looking at a scan of your wife's uh uh most detailed body
[3:45:11.240 --> 3:45:17.000]  parts on her breasts and genitals and and and and caboose it doesn't matter if all of that's
[3:45:17.000 --> 3:45:19.880]  going on doesn't matter if your five-year-old son or daughter are being put through it they're
[3:45:19.880 --> 3:45:25.880]  being recorded it's okay and public schools from tennessee missouri and california have all been
[3:45:25.880 --> 3:45:31.000]  caught mainstream news recording girls in the showers putting it on police databases sharing it
[3:45:31.000 --> 3:45:36.920]  so all of this government data they always grabs gets leaked we know this will be leaked of hollywood
[3:45:36.920 --> 3:45:43.720]  stars and others so it's literally a strip search because people need to realize that that is what
[3:45:43.720 --> 3:45:49.880]  it's doing and again we have the sexualization of torture we have the white house pushing it
[3:45:49.880 --> 3:45:59.160]  we have it continuing expanding under obama and they the the the biggest group the number one
[3:45:59.160 --> 3:46:04.600]  body of scholarships for college and community college now especially inner city youth they
[3:46:04.600 --> 3:46:10.120]  have homeland security uh through the police departments taking over the boy scouts explorer
[3:46:10.120 --> 3:46:15.640]  program 3000 graduates in la alone this year uh that's in the la times training them for warrants
[3:46:15.640 --> 3:46:21.080]  service to quote take on disgruntled vets new york times images of dead vets uh in in mock
[3:46:21.080 --> 3:46:25.960]  shootouts with the with the 14-year-old boy scouts where all the jobs the scholarships
[3:46:25.960 --> 3:46:31.000]  everything is for data mining tracking surveilling controlling which the private banking interest
[3:46:31.000 --> 3:46:36.600]  owns and controls and makes money with and pays off people in homeland security in the pentagon
[3:46:36.600 --> 3:46:40.680]  by having the pentagon and homeland security when they're in office call for more of this
[3:46:40.680 --> 3:46:44.680]  then as soon as they leave office they get executive positions in all these companies
[3:46:45.800 --> 3:46:51.800]  so that's another way to go after this is with the insider payoffs the the graft the corruption
[3:46:51.800 --> 3:46:56.040]  and that is the basic rundown
[3:46:58.440 --> 3:47:03.320]  on all of this there's a lot of other facets here's the boston globe group slams chart off
[3:47:03.320 --> 3:47:07.800]  on scanner promotion because he's making money off of it with the security consulting here's
[3:47:07.800 --> 3:47:13.160]  the boston globe close shot of that there's the army report right there u.s army report on iraqi
[3:47:13.160 --> 3:47:22.680]  prisoner abuse the actual report 2004 raping children with battery acid in front of their parents
[3:47:23.400 --> 3:47:28.120]  that's who runs things this is psychopath setting up their wonderland setting up their
[3:47:28.120 --> 3:47:32.680]  psychology selling you with all the tv and movie heroes torturing people's children to get the
[3:47:32.680 --> 3:47:37.640]  answers in the real world it's going on homeland security had a c span party when governor rich
[3:47:37.640 --> 3:47:44.840]  was in praising jack bower as their mascot totally sick frank in new york you're on the air go ahead
[3:47:47.880 --> 3:47:53.560]  you guys bring up frank in new york place thanks thanks alex a happy new year yeah you've done
[3:47:53.560 --> 3:47:59.560]  a tremendous job alerting people to the dangers of this what i think is going to have to be
[3:47:59.560 --> 3:48:05.800]  done alex is people are going to have to charge the people operating the machines with
[3:48:05.800 --> 3:48:11.800]  uh... you know creating pornography and they're going to have to uh... they're going to claim
[3:48:11.800 --> 3:48:16.440]  federal immunity but they don't have immunity because they do it in this federal power grab on
[3:48:16.440 --> 3:48:22.440]  the airport reservations that are now metastasizing out but the point is people are going to have to
[3:48:22.440 --> 3:48:26.760]  bring the cases before the court and also they're gonna have to see you can beat the rap but you
[3:48:26.760 --> 3:48:32.440]  can't go ahead no you can beat the rap but you can't beat the ride i agree with you and this is
[3:48:32.440 --> 3:48:38.920]  an important issue too uh... this is really an unlawful uh... search and seizure because no one
[3:48:38.920 --> 3:48:46.920]  has there's no probable cause yes ultimately that is what has to be brought in the lawsuit
[3:48:46.920 --> 3:48:53.640]  and also the fact that the insiders in violation of law that were passed in the 1970s
[3:48:53.640 --> 3:48:59.240]  have a conflict of interest in the government with their private investments that are not
[3:48:59.240 --> 3:49:05.560]  put in blind trusts and the law has to condone on them using recode to do that and it means
[3:49:05.560 --> 3:49:13.560]  everyone from george bush's father former president bush 41 bill clinton uh... numerous senators and
[3:49:13.560 --> 3:49:19.320]  the the neocons that were in you know both administrations i agree all of those have to be
[3:49:19.320 --> 3:49:23.560]  great point frank i appreciate your call uh... eric in pennsylvania go ahead
[3:49:23.560 --> 3:49:31.160]  hello mister alex jones pleasure to speak to you once again welcome all right so i have a solution
[3:49:31.160 --> 3:49:39.560]  here if i was alex jones what i would do is i would put a downloadable mp3 file on my website
[3:49:39.560 --> 3:49:45.240]  like info wars dot com along with the flyer the flyer can have pictures of like the woman in the
[3:49:45.240 --> 3:49:49.800]  getting her body scan the naked picture i put the naked picture right on the flyer
[3:49:49.800 --> 3:49:54.760]  some key points and then like you can put seven and then the police and news will say it's wrong
[3:49:54.760 --> 3:49:58.920]  to post pornography and you say hey the body the government's recording our naked bodies
[3:49:59.480 --> 3:50:05.240]  the people have a right to see this yeah and then uh... you can read you can have 78 minutes of
[3:50:05.240 --> 3:50:11.560]  audio on an mp3 you know else i don't understand why you don't have any on mp3 files on your website
[3:50:11.560 --> 3:50:17.880]  because what i do is i record so we do have mp3 files or at least i we had them up there
[3:50:17.880 --> 3:50:24.120]  i mean we we post that too don't we we have mp3 files on the site the listen page sir and right
[3:50:24.120 --> 3:50:30.680]  underneath the player on info wars dot com you can't download that onto a cd well i don't know what
[3:50:30.680 --> 3:50:35.160]  you're talking about we try to make it as easy as we can send it to us i have thought about my boycott
[3:50:35.160 --> 3:50:41.080]  plan having another flyer contest that is a small part of my overall operation i like to get folks
[3:50:41.080 --> 3:50:45.640]  lots of different ideas take action great points eric i appreciate it hey we're trying to get more
[3:50:45.640 --> 3:50:50.440]  employees we're trying to do a better job i'm not the only one here fighting this we're gonna post
[3:50:50.440 --> 3:50:56.920]  this on youtube prison planet dot tv spread these files out to everyone but instead it's a complaint
[3:50:56.920 --> 3:51:04.200]  about how i'm not doing enough i'm sorry i'm bad i'm bad i'm bad america is in deep deep trouble
[3:51:04.200 --> 3:51:09.400]  because we don't know our rights let's get real freedom back into america by teaching and promoting
[3:51:09.400 --> 3:51:15.160]  the bill of rights with the 2010 freedom calendar why because our forefathers gave them to us because
[3:51:15.160 --> 3:51:20.600]  the freedom calendar is true patriotism in action and because if you don't know your rights and use
