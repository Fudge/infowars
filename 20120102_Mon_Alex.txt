[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:38.120]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.120 --> 00:46.480]  here we are Monday January 2nd 2012 that's gonna take some getting used to
[00:46.480 --> 00:52.640]  we're gonna be here for the next three hours live and we don't have any guest
[00:52.640 --> 00:56.960]  today I want to have open phones throughout the three hours obviously I
[00:56.960 --> 01:06.640]  want to break down the New Year's Eve signing of the traitorous puppet in
[01:06.640 --> 01:12.800]  chief Barack Hussein who really knows who he is Obama and the treacherous
[01:12.800 --> 01:19.760]  Republican Congress that helped ram it through with the help of the Democrats
[01:19.760 --> 01:26.840]  who are nothing more than errand boys grocers clerks carrying out a little
[01:26.840 --> 01:32.120]  errand for their masters the foreign offshore banks that have taken over our
[01:32.120 --> 01:40.680]  society I saw a clip on info wars comm and article curtain Emma wrote over the
[01:40.680 --> 01:46.560]  weekend with the another national talk show host and his guest caller saying
[01:46.560 --> 01:57.360]  that anybody that likes Ron Paul is an anti-Semite and that I'm an anti-Semite
[01:57.360 --> 02:01.640]  and that if you don't like what the bankers are doing to you you're an
[02:01.640 --> 02:07.000]  anti-Semite I mean always injecting that into everything that's why the system
[02:07.000 --> 02:13.880]  is so discredited and that's why we're in such a deep crisis because the
[02:13.880 --> 02:17.880]  establishment has taken over the planet through fraud and through deception but
[02:17.880 --> 02:22.200]  now the world is waking up to it and the establishment is just going ahead with
[02:22.200 --> 02:28.080]  everything and it's on a collision course last night as I went to bed at
[02:28.080 --> 02:35.160]  about midnight I just laid there in the bed marveling at how textbook and how
[02:35.160 --> 02:42.360]  over-the-top absurdist the cameras and the black uniforms and the ski mask and
[02:42.360 --> 02:49.200]  the checkpoints and the hands down the pants TSA and the and the jumbo screens
[02:49.200 --> 02:53.280]  all over the country with with homeland security heads saying I'm here to
[02:53.280 --> 03:03.200]  protect you don't trust your neighbors and the raids on Amish and the push for
[03:03.200 --> 03:09.560]  forced inoculation and the giant prisons everywhere and the brainwashing and
[03:09.560 --> 03:15.280]  police and military and the announcements of indefinite detention it's right out
[03:15.280 --> 03:20.080]  of a dystopic novel and the reason it was hitting me so hard is I watched
[03:20.080 --> 03:25.760]  equilibrium with Christian Bale last night when I was on the treadmill again
[03:25.760 --> 03:31.120]  I'm trying to run two twice a day and I was watching and I hadn't watched it in
[03:31.120 --> 03:36.080]  a few years and it came out a decade ago or so and it was like the government's
[03:36.080 --> 03:39.400]  forced drugging people that's going on to the food the water and then overtly
[03:39.400 --> 03:43.640]  through pharmacia and the illegal drugs they ship in the big pharma as well
[03:43.640 --> 03:51.280]  there's big jumbo scron tree big jumbo tron screens saying you know only trust
[03:51.280 --> 03:54.840]  your big brother government everywhere there's police and black uniforms with
[03:54.840 --> 03:59.440]  machine guns there's armored vehicles driving around the streets there's
[03:59.440 --> 04:07.120]  paramilitary police swat teaming people and that's basically where we are and
[04:07.120 --> 04:10.880]  now they're announcing hey we're gonna start censoring your speech and even
[04:10.880 --> 04:13.600]  the inventors of the internet admit it's the end of internet freedom as we
[04:13.600 --> 04:21.760]  know it it's all happening but there are 400 million guns conservatively of new
[04:21.760 --> 04:27.600]  manufacturer that's the last 80 years is how they gauge it in this country there's
[04:27.600 --> 04:40.480]  over 150 million gun owners record gun sales took place the last month and you've
[04:40.480 --> 04:45.680]  got one guy in Washington state who's running from the cops and they got
[04:45.680 --> 04:50.040]  hundreds of them out there for one guy with guns I mean it just shows you how
[04:50.040 --> 04:56.600]  the system is a paper tiger but it thinks it thinks it's invincible it's gonna
[04:56.600 --> 05:00.560]  start a war with the American people we'll talk about it coming up this is
[05:00.560 --> 05:03.920]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[05:03.920 --> 05:07.880]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[05:07.880 --> 05:12.120]  triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to control how
[05:12.120 --> 05:16.400]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[05:16.400 --> 05:20.760]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[05:20.760 --> 05:24.840]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[05:24.840 --> 05:29.400]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[05:29.400 --> 05:33.560]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[05:33.560 --> 05:37.280]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[05:37.280 --> 05:41.320]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[05:41.320 --> 05:44.040]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[05:44.040 --> 05:50.040]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[05:50.040 --> 05:54.720]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to
[05:54.720 --> 06:01.240]  my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[06:01.240 --> 06:05.000]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs
[06:05.000 --> 06:09.720]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[06:09.720 --> 06:13.680]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[06:13.680 --> 06:17.520]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[06:17.520 --> 06:22.040]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory
[06:22.040 --> 06:27.360]  system with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the
[06:27.360 --> 06:31.640]  silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued
[06:31.640 --> 06:35.800]  legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce
[06:35.800 --> 06:41.200]  pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to
[06:41.200 --> 06:45.040]  follow step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and
[06:45.040 --> 06:51.160]  simple go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[06:51.160 --> 06:58.040]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[07:00.520 --> 07:05.360]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[07:05.360 --> 07:09.880]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[07:09.880 --> 07:13.840]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[07:13.840 --> 07:18.560]  turned in this influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[07:18.560 --> 07:23.160]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[07:23.160 --> 07:27.400]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of
[07:27.400 --> 07:32.480]  our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and
[07:32.480 --> 07:36.400]  on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the
[07:36.400 --> 07:40.240]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[07:40.240 --> 07:44.080]  do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[07:44.080 --> 07:50.080]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the
[07:50.080 --> 07:55.840]  Republic on DVD at info wars.com we're watching online right now in super
[07:55.840 --> 08:04.240]  high quality at prison planet TV from his central Texas command center deep
[08:04.240 --> 08:10.560]  behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN
[08:10.560 --> 08:23.960]  radio network
[08:23.960 --> 08:31.880]  here we are it is the first live radio transmission that I've engaged in in the
[08:31.880 --> 08:40.520]  new year it of course is Monday the second day of January 2011 2012 2013
[08:40.520 --> 08:44.280]  so that's going to take some getting used to by the time I'm accustomed to
[08:44.280 --> 08:51.560]  saying 2012 it'll already be 2013 but we are going to be here for the next three
[08:51.560 --> 08:58.600]  hours today on this Monday the second day of January 2012 and later in the
[08:58.600 --> 09:05.360]  transmission I do want to give you my breakdown of what I think is going to
[09:05.360 --> 09:11.200]  unfold in 2012 and what we're going to see the establishment do in this key
[09:11.200 --> 09:17.000]  year on so many fronts with Iran with the global economy with the domestic
[09:17.000 --> 09:20.800]  police state that's being duplicated not just here in the United States but all
[09:20.800 --> 09:26.560]  over the world that is all coming up today and then I have this little
[09:26.560 --> 09:34.960]  economist article and the cover of it says reviving the world economy stand
[09:34.960 --> 09:41.560]  back I'm a central banker and it takes a famous I guess Dutch painting of doctors
[09:41.560 --> 09:47.920]  engaging in a dissection of a dead body but instead the central banker is
[09:47.920 --> 09:52.760]  holding defibrillators like he's going to restart the heart of the economy this
[09:52.760 --> 09:58.560]  would be more accurate if it showed the central bankers as vampires and all
[09:58.560 --> 10:08.800]  sinking their teeth into the not quite yet dead person soon to be cadaver then
[10:08.800 --> 10:14.000]  it would be accurate but but this is the problem they always sell the central
[10:14.000 --> 10:21.680]  bankers as the solution to every problem when they are on its face the
[10:21.680 --> 10:29.000]  complete authors of the architecture of the system we live under today you can
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.080]  certainly partially blame the public for being lazy and easy to con for this
[10:33.080 --> 10:36.520]  happening we can all blame ourselves and look at the mirror at one level or
[10:36.520 --> 10:43.320]  another and for all of us you're selling out and even at a subconscious level to
[10:43.320 --> 10:52.960]  the system but the main drivers the captains of the ship the new world order
[10:52.960 --> 11:02.240]  system those piloting our culture are the six mega private banks that created
[11:02.240 --> 11:07.680]  the front consortiums of the so-called Federal Reserve European Central Bank
[11:07.680 --> 11:13.640]  Bank of England which are just their their their quasi government fronts to
[11:13.640 --> 11:18.120]  carry out their crimes they are the enemy they are the authors of the carbon
[11:18.120 --> 11:24.760]  tax of the open borders of the imperial wars of the police state of the medical
[11:24.760 --> 11:30.720]  mafia pushing forced inoculations in every case it is a handful of families
[11:30.720 --> 11:36.760]  that are the private shareholders of the six global mega banks we've listed them
[11:36.760 --> 11:44.560]  here many times Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Bank of America Wells Fargo City Bank and
[11:44.560 --> 11:48.520]  then a few other European consortium banks that are all really own by the
[11:48.520 --> 11:54.600]  same people so it's six consortiums and they are the authors of it all I mean I
[11:54.600 --> 12:04.280]  showed you the Economist magazine from November and this is the type of
[12:04.280 --> 12:09.440]  publication just like the Times of London or the Financial Times which is
[12:09.440 --> 12:13.600]  even more important where they throw it in your face remember that article a
[12:13.600 --> 12:17.240]  few years ago by the foreign editor of the Financial Times of London headline
[12:17.240 --> 12:21.400]  and now for world government please put that on screen if you're a radio
[12:21.400 --> 12:24.720]  listener on XM or local AM and F and you're saying put it on screen yes we're
[12:24.720 --> 12:29.480]  simulcasting everything at prisonplanet.tv and we also have the
[12:29.480 --> 12:32.560]  nightly news there of your subscriber but we've now started a system where you
[12:32.560 --> 12:37.560]  can watch a lower res version of the show live and not just the audio at
[12:37.560 --> 12:41.440]  mfullwars.com there in the right hand corner now everybody can basically
[12:41.440 --> 12:46.360]  watch if you go to mfullwars.com and click the upper watch the show live
[12:46.360 --> 12:50.560]  banner you can actually see this for yourself there it is and now for world
[12:50.560 --> 12:57.880]  government December 9th 2008 well that seems like yesterday that's actually
[12:57.880 --> 13:05.000]  three years ago wow a little over three years ago and he goes on to say yes
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.320]  there's a private global corporate government yes it's authoritarian in
[13:09.320 --> 13:16.400]  nature go read the article and yes we're going to take your liberties but it's
[13:16.400 --> 13:20.800]  because your nation states are primitive that's why they have an image of a
[13:20.800 --> 13:26.200]  cave drawing there and we know best we're technocrats and we kept a secret
[13:26.200 --> 13:31.320]  from you for your own interest and that is exactly what the economist November
[13:31.320 --> 13:37.480]  19th the 25th weekly edition that I've covered so much here said they say yes
[13:37.480 --> 13:41.120]  technocrats have run things in the Soviet era and didn't do probably the
[13:41.120 --> 13:45.720]  best job but our technocrats are better and they say in here you can argue that
[13:45.720 --> 13:49.960]  this is the best system now and regardless that's what runs things so it is
[13:49.960 --> 13:56.080]  an apologetic open world government article but saying it's for your own
[13:56.080 --> 14:02.200]  interest and that particular article is is titled minds like machines
[14:02.200 --> 14:07.880]  technocrats minds like machines technocracy was once a communist idea
[14:07.880 --> 14:11.440]  with the proletariat power administration could be left to experts
[14:11.440 --> 14:21.160]  ah yes or or we have a big computer run everything there's the actual article I
[14:21.160 --> 14:25.120]  have my little photocopies here so I can highlight it and it goes on
[14:25.120 --> 14:31.080]  technocracy and autocracy have long been natural bedfellows technocrats rule
[14:31.080 --> 14:35.040]  big chunks of public life central bankers are one example and it goes on
[14:35.040 --> 14:39.520]  here even highly political government set up independent or bipartisan panels
[14:39.520 --> 14:42.640]  that make difficult decisions yeah I'm so spending bills originating the
[14:42.640 --> 14:46.120]  super congress now not by individual members such as closing military bases
[14:46.120 --> 14:51.000]  setting electoral boundaries and making spending cuts no it's supposed to be
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.320]  simple votes they create independent agencies are independent but the
[14:55.320 --> 14:59.200]  globalist run them to run everything from health care to education they put
[14:59.200 --> 15:03.320]  outside experts in top jobs such as the economists Larry Summers of the Clinton
[15:03.320 --> 15:07.440]  administration and Obama administrations that got rid of Glass-Steagall yeah what
[15:07.440 --> 15:12.840]  what great what great experts they were and then you go on here let me find the
[15:12.840 --> 15:17.800]  actual part they got another quote where it says and yes you can argue that we
[15:17.800 --> 15:24.000]  need technocrats now they know they know how to run things best now I just showed
[15:24.000 --> 15:31.200]  you the in fact reprint me that because there were two versions yet another one
[15:31.200 --> 15:34.560]  that was a blog responding to everybody I don't know that's the blog or the
[15:34.560 --> 15:40.880]  original article scroll up for me please so I can read it and when you read it
[15:40.880 --> 15:51.480]  there he actually breaks down that it's for the betterment of everybody he says
[15:51.480 --> 15:57.760]  I've never believed that there is a secret you put it back on screen for me
[15:57.760 --> 16:02.440]  please I've never believed that there is a secret United Nations plot to take
[16:02.440 --> 16:05.920]  over the US I've never seen black helicopters hovering in the sky above
[16:05.920 --> 16:10.360]  Montana but for the first time in my life I think the formation of some sort
[16:10.360 --> 16:15.280]  of world government is plausible a world government so so again if you don't
[16:15.280 --> 16:19.720]  like world government you're a cook but but we need one and I think this is his
[16:19.720 --> 16:23.520]  blog response when he got attacked for saying we need a world government a
[16:23.520 --> 16:29.120]  world government would involve much more than cooperation between nations it
[16:29.120 --> 16:34.480]  would be an entity with state-like characteristics backed by a body of
[16:34.480 --> 16:38.520]  laws the European Union has already set up a continental government for 27
[16:38.520 --> 16:43.040]  countries which could be the model the EU has the Supreme Court a currency
[16:43.040 --> 16:47.440]  thousands of pages of law a civil service and an ability to deploy
[16:47.440 --> 16:55.080]  military force so could the European model go global there are three reasons
[16:55.080 --> 16:59.360]  for thinking that it might first is increasingly clear that the most
[16:59.360 --> 17:04.000]  difficult issues facing national governments are international in nature
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.680]  there is a global warming a global financial crisis and a global war on
[17:07.680 --> 17:12.040]  terror and what a club of Rome say in the 60s will use the terror threat the
[17:12.040 --> 17:16.760]  environmental threat and other threats global problems to unify it in fact I
[17:16.760 --> 17:19.680]  just want to that article from memory print it for me I'm gonna highlight the
[17:19.680 --> 17:22.920]  parts and there's a second I think that's the second part there's a first
[17:22.920 --> 17:26.880]  part where he comes out and says yes it's authoritarian in nature yes we kept
[17:26.880 --> 17:33.240]  it from you but it's for your own good the point is that here they are saying
[17:33.240 --> 17:38.280]  Larry Summers will fix everything when it's Larry Summers who got rid of the
[17:38.280 --> 17:49.440]  Glass-Steagall with Obama's progenitor the Clintons and then now Larry Summers
[17:49.440 --> 17:56.320]  is back advising under Obama and do people expect there to be any change
[17:56.320 --> 18:01.960]  when this is the policy we go to the people that engineered all of this and
[18:01.960 --> 18:05.840]  we read publications that they own and control who never even mentioned hey
[18:05.840 --> 18:09.560]  they're the ones that did all this when it's as obvious as the nose on your face
[18:09.560 --> 18:15.280]  and so I'm gonna be breaking that down later in the broadcast I've already
[18:15.280 --> 18:22.240]  started doing it here right now now when we come back from break I'm gonna
[18:22.240 --> 18:26.120]  break down obviously the top news of the day and and and and try to go through
[18:26.120 --> 18:31.280]  every angle and facet of it that's why I've written here on construction paper
[18:31.280 --> 18:38.040]  right got up in the middle of the night was creeping around the house and the
[18:38.040 --> 18:41.480]  first paper I came across with some of the children's construction paper so I
[18:41.480 --> 18:48.320]  wrote I don't know three four pages of notes here breaking down why the
[18:48.320 --> 18:56.840]  different formulae that are used why would Obama say he'd veto the bill
[18:56.840 --> 19:01.000]  because it had indefinite detention for citizens in it and then sign the bill
[19:01.000 --> 19:05.280]  and then it emerges that it was the White House demanded those provisions be
[19:05.280 --> 19:14.440]  there and Obama knew that and I break down why they deceive that way why they
[19:14.440 --> 19:21.080]  do that and what the NDAA does and where things are going but where are all

[24:30.880 --> 24:36.000]  other topic you wish to raise here we are live it is the second day of January
[24:36.000 --> 24:41.720]  2012 on this Monday edition and it's gonna take some getting used to here
[24:41.720 --> 24:48.840]  obviously time is speeding up now we had seen some false alarms in the media
[24:48.840 --> 24:51.840]  saying that Obama had signed this about a week and a half ago those were not
[24:51.840 --> 24:58.520]  accurate he did indeed sign it in private the Associated Press reported
[24:58.520 --> 25:07.360]  Saturday afternoon in Hawaii that was in the evening Saturday here on the mainland
[25:07.360 --> 25:13.920]  and he signed it privately he did not have a robo sign do it a robot a
[25:13.920 --> 25:17.880]  computerized signature which has been found to be unconstitutional but so
[25:17.880 --> 25:22.560]  we're signing statements and in the signing statement you can read it at
[25:22.560 --> 25:26.680]  infowars.com drudgereport.com has been linked to our article about it with a
[25:26.680 --> 25:30.360]  signing statement added but we actually put links to where Obama's lying in his
[25:30.360 --> 25:33.320]  signing statement that's been on the drudge report since yesterday afternoon
[25:33.320 --> 25:37.640]  it's now moved down the right-hand side halfway down but it was the top story
[25:37.640 --> 25:44.840]  yesterday which again I appreciate I appreciate drudge actually linking to a
[25:44.840 --> 25:50.640]  real article where we have links in Obama's statement when he says I'm
[25:50.640 --> 25:54.080]  against the indefinite detention for citizens but I'm still signing it we
[25:54.080 --> 25:58.040]  have links to Carl Levin and other senators saying Obama demanded this be
[25:58.040 --> 26:02.560]  added and we have links to him saying he wouldn't sign it with that in there we
[26:02.560 --> 26:06.320]  just show the lies
[26:06.960 --> 26:11.160]  now the question is why lie I'm gonna explain that in a moment because when
[26:11.160 --> 26:15.880]  you understand this lie and you peel back the layers of the onion I've
[26:15.880 --> 26:22.560]  studied these people in depth I know them then you understand how weak they
[26:22.560 --> 26:28.480]  are how incredibly weak and pathetic they are now you're like well then why
[26:28.480 --> 26:33.960]  are they running everything because we are laying down I mean if you didn't
[26:33.960 --> 26:38.840]  fight back against a seven-year-old they could probably kill you you just laid
[26:38.840 --> 26:41.920]  there they could get a sharp stick and stick it in your eye and cram it down
[26:41.920 --> 26:48.240]  into your brain probably I mean if you lay there in a bed of fire ants and
[26:48.240 --> 26:52.920]  don't get up they can kill you they're a little bit of ants and that's basically
[26:52.920 --> 26:57.040]  what it is the new world order are a bunch of ants and we just lay here with
[26:57.040 --> 27:01.080]  them crawling all over a stinginess and I'm jumping up and down saying let's get
[27:01.080 --> 27:07.240]  up but individually I'm like a little little pulley you know those little
[27:07.240 --> 27:14.880]  people that you know tie the giant down I'm small but together we're big we are
[27:14.880 --> 27:18.840]  the body politic the globalists are tiny but together they're powerful and
[27:18.840 --> 27:22.160]  they know how to work together that's what the Council on Foreign Relations
[27:22.160 --> 27:26.440]  and other people do so I'll say it again in the new year I'm very thankful to Matt
[27:26.440 --> 27:32.680]  Drudge and Joseph Curle and all the people over at the Drudge report because
[27:32.680 --> 27:36.560]  it is the biggest news site in the world undisputed New York Times others
[27:36.560 --> 27:44.720]  admitted it drives more traffic than Twitter Facebook combined and all the
[27:44.720 --> 27:48.560]  other so-called conservative sites and libertarian and constitutional sites and
[27:48.560 --> 27:52.780]  even liberal sites mainly will not ever point out the emperors wearing no
[27:52.780 --> 27:58.400]  clothes and info wars comms huge prison planets gigantic with the radio show and
[27:58.400 --> 28:01.920]  the YouTube channels and everything we do we're big we're the one of the biggest
[28:01.920 --> 28:05.560]  things out there but when it comes to internet there's nothing even approaching
[28:05.560 --> 28:11.880]  Drudge and this morning I tuned in to talk radio and what were they talking
[28:11.880 --> 28:17.440]  about in San Antonio and then I spent about an hour when I was in the treadmill
[28:17.440 --> 28:21.560]  listening to radio this morning instead of watching film tuned to local radio and
[28:21.560 --> 28:29.880]  heard them talk about this on local 590 two different shows W.O.A.I. and 590
[28:29.880 --> 28:34.240]  K.L.B.J. here in town were and that was the two stations I listened to all the
[28:34.240 --> 28:40.880]  treadmill for 45 minutes was because of Drudge they were reading this and saying
[28:40.880 --> 28:44.720]  should the government be able to secretly arrest citizens and have you
[28:44.720 --> 28:49.600]  disappear into a black hole and they were reading from the article I could
[28:49.600 --> 28:55.040]  care less they didn't give me any credit all I care about is stopping this
[28:55.040 --> 28:58.960]  because I have children because I want to be free because I want to have a
[28:58.960 --> 29:04.160]  future and I'm telling you that's the power of the drudge report this is not a
[29:04.160 --> 29:07.520]  bunch of rump kissing here I'm gonna come back I should get into it the
[29:07.520 --> 29:11.840]  actual article and I'm signing it it's just that info wars yeah we can put an
[29:11.840 --> 29:16.000]  article out and sometimes it breaks into the quote mainstream and really goes
[29:16.000 --> 29:21.920]  mega viral but with drudge it's guaranteed every time and so it's the
[29:21.920 --> 29:25.280]  drudge is saying the emperor is not wearing clothes here's Obama lying and
[29:25.280 --> 29:30.320]  links to it that's a big deal so I just give thanks to that in the new year and
[29:30.320 --> 29:35.120]  give thanks to the internet is still here in somewhat of a free position for
[29:35.120 --> 29:40.080]  now but even AP Reuters the top scientist that invented the internet all of
[29:40.080 --> 29:45.120]  them are public right now even Politico saying this soap a bill is the end of
[29:45.120 --> 29:50.280]  the internet and the end of free speech and the end of due process we're on the

[33:25.560 --> 33:29.800]  give the number out here in just a few minutes coming up it's littered with
[33:29.800 --> 33:33.840]  cuss words but we're gonna bleep them out and air it on the nightly news this
[33:33.840 --> 33:38.720]  evening disturbing video that shows US soldiers blowing up a dog in Iraq for
[33:38.720 --> 33:45.720]  fun there are hundreds of these videos the US troops killing people sheep cows
[33:45.720 --> 33:53.280]  horses for fun blowing up people's dogs killing puppies and when we showed one
[33:53.280 --> 33:58.400]  of these videos a few years ago a fake conservative who goes along with the
[33:58.400 --> 34:03.640]  entire system Michelle Malkin came out and said I was a liar and that it was a
[34:03.640 --> 34:08.080]  toy dog now clearly it was a puppy holding its feet up when you hold a
[34:08.080 --> 34:11.080]  mother's grab for the neck clearly they kill it the Marines had an
[34:11.080 --> 34:15.360]  investigation it confirmed it was real and they didn't care Malkin continued to
[34:15.360 --> 34:20.040]  say it wasn't real and then I was a liar so when I ran into her she had these
[34:20.040 --> 34:24.600]  local Republican college bloggers with her they posed as if they were with us
[34:24.600 --> 34:29.560]  wearing masks and hats and screamed kill Michelle Malkin and then put out a blog
[34:29.560 --> 34:35.040]  saying I said killer and national so-called conservative radio went with
[34:35.040 --> 34:40.480]  I'm calling for killing Michelle Malkin and even the Denver Post ran with it
[34:40.480 --> 34:47.640]  national TV ran with it they sent extra out it was clearly a Psyop and
[34:47.640 --> 34:52.440]  interviewed me there in Denver when I was at the DNC and said why did you say
[34:52.440 --> 34:56.120]  killer and I showed him my own video and the reporter basically laughed at me and
[34:56.120 --> 35:00.360]  left and never even showed that and I still get emails saying how dare you say
[35:00.360 --> 35:05.120]  killer it's on the video I'm screaming how dare you say I'm a liar they killed
[35:05.120 --> 35:08.600]  that dog admit it's real it's been admitted it's real and they just said
[35:08.600 --> 35:13.000]  you know what kill Michelle Malkin they screamed behind me crouching down
[35:13.000 --> 35:17.720]  Psyop experts and then they all left with her they all walked off gotten cars and
[35:17.720 --> 35:23.480]  left with her that's what they think is cute they think it's fun to deceive the
[35:23.480 --> 35:29.160]  public to pose as conservatives so you can lead the opposition to the new
[35:29.160 --> 35:35.760]  world order as loyal opposition and lead it down a rat hole and there's a new
[35:35.760 --> 35:38.800]  video out today the only reason I'm covering it is it happened to be in the
[35:38.800 --> 35:44.520]  newspaper I mean I don't even if I wanted to quote just bash the troops I
[35:44.520 --> 35:51.040]  could have these every day forget killing dogs I've got British troops US
[35:51.040 --> 35:57.640]  troops contractors sitting off the side of highways just shooting families in
[35:57.640 --> 36:02.120]  many vans and Lincoln town cars and men and women rolling out bleeding and
[36:02.120 --> 36:06.000]  shooting them and shooting women while they walk down a desert road with a
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.920]  four-year-old holding their hand and they laugh as the 50 cal blows their head
[36:09.920 --> 36:15.320]  off and I've got them torturing children just beating them and beating them
[36:15.320 --> 36:20.080]  you know I think I ought to put a US troop compilation torture together we'll
[36:20.080 --> 36:23.920]  do that it'll take a few days to compile it though Wednesday or Thursday on the
[36:23.920 --> 36:30.880]  nightly news so they got to bleep out all the cussing we will leave in the pit
[36:30.880 --> 36:40.720]  demon noises though the the psycho masochistic demon demon surfacing the
[36:40.720 --> 36:49.680]  demon surfacing part will leave in okay I'm gonna leave all that in oh you
[36:49.680 --> 36:52.320]  think I'm joking we're gonna get it all together we've heard those here before
[36:52.320 --> 37:01.880]  yes yes oh bad little child naughty naughty like a boy but guys we have
[37:01.880 --> 37:06.680]  that in the computer it's something like British troops beat children yeah
[37:06.680 --> 37:12.560]  that but you always hear that same noise in these videos American troops
[37:12.560 --> 37:20.840]  British contractors always when they're doing it you hear the demonic entity
[37:20.840 --> 37:26.320]  come to the surface and it's having a vampire feeding frenzy and it just
[37:26.320 --> 37:30.640]  totally takes them over and boy do we get death threats and everything when we
[37:30.640 --> 37:35.800]  play this stuff because they don't want that known they call that anti US
[37:35.800 --> 37:43.200]  military no letting our military be taken over by a culture of demonic little
[37:43.200 --> 37:49.720]  creatures that is destroying our military in our name worldwide because
[37:49.720 --> 37:55.920]  this is all over TV worldwide in fact it's come out the CIA globally releases
[37:55.920 --> 38:00.840]  the photos and the videos of this but only for foreign use for our future
[38:00.840 --> 38:05.960]  destruction domestically you're not meant to see this remember the United
[38:05.960 --> 38:13.160]  States is the main enemy the Republic is the enemy so while they use America to
[38:13.160 --> 38:18.720]  set up this world government when they're done with us the world's got a
[38:18.720 --> 38:22.720]  completely absolutely hate us then they'll trigger a civil war here in the
[38:22.720 --> 38:27.400]  US with attempted gun confiscation this is one of their main plans marching the
[38:27.400 --> 38:32.880]  police and military off to certain death in gun confiscation certain death and
[38:32.880 --> 38:37.560]  that's part of the plan then the I for you in global troops will come in that's
[38:37.560 --> 38:41.560]  now in all the official FEMA homeland security documents I used to have to get
[38:41.560 --> 38:45.200]  military officers like Colonel Craig Roberts on you know who's like yeah my
[38:45.200 --> 38:49.240]  nephew after his graduation at West Point was sent to this base and here's
[38:49.240 --> 38:52.640]  the names of the generals that said that during an emergency they will use
[38:52.640 --> 38:55.760]  foreign troops to fight domestic terrorists now that's in the Washington
[38:55.760 --> 39:01.200]  Post in New York Times that oh yes during crises we will use foreign troops to
[39:01.200 --> 39:07.080]  deal with domestic problems but that's after the police and military many of
[39:07.080 --> 39:11.120]  which are honorable good people are marched off against the general public
[39:11.120 --> 39:17.840]  and of course the breakdown of society will be so horrible at that point that
[39:17.840 --> 39:23.800]  many of the public will say sure arrest political dissidents just bring back the
[39:23.800 --> 39:29.120]  prosperity and of course when you go along with the tyranny it won't bring
[39:29.120 --> 39:33.440]  back the prosperity just like I told you four years ago the 2008 bailouts I
[39:33.440 --> 39:37.880]  said this is not gonna fix things this is gonna make things worse next they're
[39:37.880 --> 39:41.880]  gonna implode Europe then they're gonna take over with austerity raising taxes
[39:41.880 --> 39:46.880]  cutting benefits not to pay public debts but to pay for the bankers Ponzi scheme
[39:46.880 --> 39:50.960]  that they've gotten the public to sign on to that they then spin and say is the
[39:50.960 --> 39:58.840]  public debt and they have all these different media outlets running around
[39:58.840 --> 40:02.200]  pushing it if I give me a document cam shot of this here's the cover of the
[40:02.200 --> 40:07.080]  economist if you're in storage you'll see it and on newstands reviving the world
[40:07.080 --> 40:13.240]  economy stand back I'm a central banker they take a famous maybe a rembrandt
[40:13.240 --> 40:20.760]  Dutch painting of a dissection of a corpse I guess what they wrote Grey's
[40:20.760 --> 40:26.520]  anatomy from and he's got defibrillators about to start the debt economy's heart
[40:26.520 --> 40:30.240]  and of course they say the central bankers will fix it and of course it's
[40:30.240 --> 40:34.440]  all the exact names that engineered this they're not gonna fix anything their
[40:34.440 --> 40:38.960]  takeover is working the way they want it to but they're gonna bombard you with
[40:38.960 --> 40:45.840]  they'll fix it just give them total power again this was an accurate photoshop
[40:45.840 --> 40:51.400]  of a famous painting they would all be vampires with straws drinking this
[40:51.400 --> 40:57.800]  person's blood assanguating him sucking him dry we'll be going over that a
[40:57.800 --> 41:02.000]  little bit later now continuing here's I'm gonna get on the big news and then
[41:02.000 --> 41:07.280]  your calls but we'll get to the troops killing him in a minute but it all ties
[41:07.280 --> 41:14.480]  together in DAA the troops killing dogs sheep cows horses any chance they can the
[41:14.480 --> 41:18.880]  army murdering them just just but again people don't even get upset when it's a
[41:18.880 --> 41:22.400]  family and you see him shooting the minivan off the road and the family
[41:22.400 --> 41:25.840]  falling out and people trying to grab their kids and the troops are laughing
[41:25.840 --> 41:30.320]  and then and then the jebbering starts like whoa demon just surfaced it's in
[41:30.320 --> 41:35.880]  full full feeding mode it doesn't matter every nationality I've seen Russian
[41:35.880 --> 41:43.680]  troop yeah stuff and it's the same jebbering noise and I mean you you can
[41:43.680 --> 41:46.560]  say there's no such thing as demons whatever a section of the brain that
[41:46.560 --> 41:51.040]  does that okay it's the same signature it's the same same thing you want to
[41:51.040 --> 41:53.400]  know what a psychopaths doing their torture in some three-year-old they
[41:53.400 --> 41:59.440]  kidnapped in some dungeon for six months that's going on and the psychopaths
[41:59.440 --> 42:04.400]  tell the psychiatrist about they they love sucking the essence out of it they
[42:04.400 --> 42:11.680]  call it using someone up and they feed off the fear and the pain it's an
[42:11.680 --> 42:16.400]  enjoyment and so if you support the troops you're supposed to say this is
[42:16.400 --> 42:20.680]  wonderful and defend it and say oh they're just blowing off some steam in
[42:20.680 --> 42:24.320]  fact I remember that rush limbaugh clip where it came out about Abu Ghraib and
[42:24.320 --> 42:27.600]  torture of children and he said folks you ever been under stress you ever
[42:27.600 --> 42:34.320]  blown off some steam just type it in a rush limbaugh talks about torture is
[42:34.320 --> 42:38.760]  blowing off steam and we're talking about four-year-olds in front of their
[42:38.760 --> 42:42.680]  parents being raped with objects dripping with battery acid that's in the
[42:42.680 --> 42:48.320]  army's own reports type in army Abu Ghraib torture report you'll get AP MSNBC
[42:48.320 --> 42:55.840]  the army's report it's 14 pages long read it 30 plus camps 24-7 gang raping
[42:55.840 --> 43:03.000]  torturing murdering killing pit demon absolute pit of hell this is what you've
[43:03.000 --> 43:08.000]  signed on to preemptive war all of it this is what happens this is what the
[43:08.000 --> 43:13.120]  Nazis did this is what the communist Chinese did and do this is what the
[43:13.120 --> 43:22.480]  psycho armies want and we've shown you internal memos where in Texas they say
[43:22.480 --> 43:28.160]  we're only hiring former military right now do not distribute this memo that we
[43:28.160 --> 43:34.040]  were sent that four months ago it says right now we've been directed to only
[43:34.040 --> 43:38.000]  focus on military I guess you might be able to get hired for military but again
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.040]  not just regular military they have tests they give them that if you're
[43:42.040 --> 43:50.680]  damaged goods you're gonna get the job and you're gonna wage war against the
[43:50.680 --> 44:00.200]  American people that's what they want that's why I have New York Times don't
[44:00.200 --> 44:03.720]  believe me just type in scouts trained to fight terrorist and more and the
[44:03.720 --> 44:10.280]  first line says the 14-year-old train to kill disgruntled veterans in this drill
[44:10.280 --> 44:15.320]  the Iraq vet has holed up they quickly move in and take him out you can see the
[44:15.320 --> 44:22.360]  photos of him training to kill veterans because you see they want the the the
[44:22.360 --> 44:29.640]  PTSD 456 tour violent fearless people to join their ranks but they also know
[44:29.640 --> 44:33.600]  that there's going to be giant groups who aren't turned over to evil but are
[44:33.600 --> 44:40.160]  just as tough or tougher who were going to then fight the forces of evil but
[44:40.160 --> 44:43.760]  there's also going to be a third group people that just go off the rails who
[44:43.760 --> 44:48.200]  don't get hired as cops or whatever and that's like this guy and when I get to
[44:48.200 --> 44:51.720]  after the Obama I'll show you this article we'll put it on screen massive
[44:51.720 --> 44:59.040]  manhunt after Ranger slain in Rainier we'll pull this up for later and it says
[44:59.040 --> 45:06.080]  he is a former several tours what Marines and it was supposedly a shoot
[45:06.080 --> 45:09.880]  out of a party so he ran with his body armor and everything reportedly to the
[45:09.880 --> 45:14.560]  local national park they set up a roadblock he got out opened fire more
[45:14.560 --> 45:18.480]  police showed up and they sat there for hours while the park ranger bled to
[45:18.480 --> 45:23.320]  death because he was shooting at him and now there's hundreds of federal police
[45:23.320 --> 45:28.000]  and others on the scene and they're basically caloring a day later afraid to
[45:28.000 --> 45:33.400]  go after it okay now now now what's going to happen when you start secretly
[45:33.400 --> 45:39.600]  arresting people and you start going out trying to confiscate guns 150 million
[45:39.600 --> 45:43.600]  it's more like 200 million now there's a massive armament going on millions of it
[45:43.600 --> 45:46.520]  more like 2 million they're saying a million and a half plus background
[45:46.520 --> 45:50.280]  checks in the month of December all-time record most sales are going on
[45:50.280 --> 45:54.680]  privately you got 400 plus million guns out there you've got all of this
[45:54.680 --> 45:58.160]  happening all of this unfolding and what's going to happen when the
[45:58.160 --> 46:01.920]  government run by these criminal bankers who are sitting offshore try to
[46:01.920 --> 46:06.440]  march the police and military off in asymmetrical warfare to take people's
[46:06.440 --> 46:12.520]  guns and to take political prisoners away if 1% fights back that's a
[46:12.520 --> 46:18.440]  million five hundred thousand of this guy and I'm not saying he's a good guy
[46:18.440 --> 46:24.040]  he late-night party got drunk started you know some kind of fight happened
[46:24.040 --> 46:30.080]  shootout began just like poplotsky drunk gets home has another pit bull
[46:30.080 --> 46:34.320]  urinating all over the carpet his mother says get out of here she says I
[46:34.320 --> 46:41.600]  he she calls the police he shoots and kills three of them the point is is that
[46:41.600 --> 46:46.280]  you train these people to just mow Iraq he's down all day and laugh at dead kids
[46:46.280 --> 46:51.040]  and kill dogs and and murder people and do all this of course they've got
[46:51.040 --> 46:54.960]  record suicides all-time records of course they're coming home they had one
[46:54.960 --> 47:00.560]  Delta Force wing or squadron as they called them what was it five years ago
[47:00.560 --> 47:06.760]  in one weekend killed four families well in one case the family got away he
[47:06.760 --> 47:10.960]  burned the house down and when the police pulled up he was he was in the
[47:10.960 --> 47:19.680]  news they're outside for binning was flopping around foaming at the mouth you
[47:19.680 --> 47:23.120]  pull up the house is burning the person is flopping around they're so
[47:23.120 --> 47:28.840]  demonically possessed or whatever you want to call it I mean look you you so
[47:28.840 --> 47:35.840]  hell you you reap Armageddon you get into evil and corruption and think it's
[47:35.840 --> 47:40.960]  cute and sexy and fun it isn't the wages of the New World Order is thermal
[47:40.960 --> 47:46.840]  nuclear war biological weapons imploding bank accounts starvation death and
[47:46.840 --> 47:54.800]  everything that leads up to it but I'll actually read over the article later
[47:54.800 --> 47:59.120]  when there's a photo of him here we know where he's got his his different guns
[47:59.120 --> 48:03.480]  and his shirt off and you know he's the big tough guy and now they're gonna send
[48:03.480 --> 48:10.400]  a bunch of other people just like him after him and hundreds of local police
[48:10.400 --> 48:13.680]  and the feds are in the article admitting they're not going after him
[48:13.680 --> 48:19.160]  cuz they're scared what you're scared of somebody that'll actually shoot back
[48:19.160 --> 48:24.720]  at you you're scared of another psychopath oh this isn't some old lady you're
[48:24.720 --> 48:29.560]  who you're taking the cash out of their purse this isn't some you know 16-year-old
[48:29.560 --> 48:32.960]  kid you found some marijuana on so you go ahead and beat him up and send him to
[48:32.960 --> 48:38.960]  jail you mean that you mean this is somebody like you
[48:42.040 --> 48:47.040]  what what do you think's gonna happen when they try to march you off against
[48:47.040 --> 48:53.040]  real Americans real human beings what do you think's gonna happen you think one
[48:53.040 --> 48:58.040]  percent's gonna fight you numbers I've looked at instead of about 10% are gonna
[48:58.040 --> 49:03.800]  fight you know what 10% of 150 million is
[49:04.720 --> 49:09.720]  you know what that is it's 15 million
[49:09.720 --> 49:22.600]  15 million people conservatively are gonna fight and we have to overt this
[49:22.600 --> 49:26.960]  disaster we do not want this to start up we do not want this to happen because
[49:26.960 --> 49:31.440]  that's one of the false flags the new order can run is marching the police and
[49:31.440 --> 49:38.280]  military off into a conflict and to create a civil war here in the United
[49:38.280 --> 49:45.480]  States that's actually in the IMF and World Bank documents all right I was just
[49:45.480 --> 49:48.360]  gonna mention some of the news coming up I've pretty much already started getting
[49:48.360 --> 49:57.640]  into it and I've got page after page of notes on the NDAA and just how big it is
[49:57.640 --> 50:03.080]  and just how important is and just what it means to our society and how it's
[50:03.080 --> 50:07.720]  gonna be implemented and how it's gonna be rolled out but I'll tell you what I'm
[50:07.720 --> 50:10.360]  gonna do I'm gonna reset because I'm pretty wound up for me I'm gone a couple
[50:10.360 --> 50:14.080]  days now I'm gonna come back and take your phone calls into the bottom of the
[50:14.080 --> 50:18.440]  hour next hour and then I'm gonna get into the NDAA in total detail I've got
[50:18.440 --> 50:23.200]  him I did all this research last night this morning and got all my ducks in a
[50:23.200 --> 50:26.320]  row and tonight we're really having a special report on it that'll be highly
[50:26.320 --> 50:30.120]  produced where we've got all the clips and even more proof tonight on the

[50:43.760 --> 50:47.360]  haven't been twisted to the dark side and we don't need to be like the
[50:47.360 --> 50:51.600]  American people in the police military like pit bulls they put in an arena to
[50:51.600 --> 50:57.520]  kill each other or a cock fight we need to be smarter than this and realize who

[54:40.120 --> 54:44.920]  later in the next hour Huntsman has put out a new attack hat on Ron Paul using
[54:44.920 --> 54:48.840]  clips of him on c-span talking about a new world order Skellen bones and a clip
[54:48.840 --> 54:54.840]  from in game where he quotes George Bush senior he says George Bush senior
[54:54.840 --> 54:57.920]  called for a new world order what's weird is they all call for a new world
[54:57.920 --> 55:03.000]  order Al Gore Bill Clinton all of them they say a new world order is a global
[55:03.000 --> 55:06.640]  corporate government and then Ron Paul says I don't want a global corporate
[55:06.640 --> 55:12.680]  private government run by mega banks and they go oh my gosh he's crazy he he's
[55:12.680 --> 55:18.760]  quoting George W. Bush Herbert Walker Bush calling for it and they think their
[55:18.760 --> 55:23.160]  supporters are that big of an idiot that that as long as they sit there and
[55:23.160 --> 55:28.960]  deny that this stuff is going on that people won't realize what's happening
[55:28.960 --> 55:33.080]  now look I can't play all of these here because there's cuss words on them and
[55:33.080 --> 55:37.360]  things and even pretty much got to be watching to be able to see it but here's
[55:37.360 --> 55:45.320]  the latest article out showing what the military is doing disturbing video that
[55:45.320 --> 55:50.080]  shows us soldiers blowing up a dog in Iraq for fun and again this is not the
[55:50.080 --> 55:53.920]  majority of the troops but it's like when you see that Apache helicopter shoot
[55:53.920 --> 55:57.280]  up that car full of kids they kind of laugh about it and say well shouldn't
[55:57.280 --> 56:00.720]  bring kids to a battle it wasn't a battle is middle of a city it was Reuters
[56:00.720 --> 56:05.440]  reporters with their kids and then people defended that on the radio they
[56:05.440 --> 56:10.440]  defend torture on the radio well this is this is what torture is let's go
[56:10.440 --> 56:13.440]  ahead and play part of that clip
[56:14.440 --> 56:20.680]  and again there's just a dog it's in a city the side of the road they've put
[56:20.680 --> 56:27.280]  some food out for it next to a bomb and the audio is not good but you can hear
[56:27.280 --> 56:32.160]  I'm talking about it all come on puppy puppy they make sweet you know fake
[56:32.160 --> 56:41.400]  sweet noises to it come on kid get in the car and cousins coming up they start
[56:41.400 --> 56:44.400]  celebrating and getting off on it let's let's go ahead that's enough right there
[56:44.400 --> 56:48.200]  so they blow up the dog and have a big celebration now here's another video
[56:48.200 --> 56:54.720]  that I mentioned where Michelle Malcolm and others said I was a liar in fact some
[56:54.720 --> 57:00.000]  blogs and groups neocon groups said that we might have even produced it that it
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.000]  was a robot dog anybody's ever had a dog knows you pick one up by the back of a
[57:04.000 --> 57:08.280]  scrub for the neck it pulls its little legs up you can see it's a real puppy
[57:08.280 --> 57:13.800]  and they throw it off a cliff and the Marines did investigation said yes it
[57:13.800 --> 57:18.840]  was true but notice people don't get upset about Iraqi kids being killed that's
[57:18.840 --> 57:26.440]  manly and good it's a dog because dogs haven't been dehumanized yet there's
[57:26.440 --> 57:30.800]  more value in an animal in our culture you know my dad was coming over to do
[57:30.800 --> 57:34.640]  some 22 shooting with my children yesterday and I said well everything's
[57:34.640 --> 57:37.960]  closed today but I said we go to Walmart and buy some of those box targets
[57:37.960 --> 57:42.480]  the Styrofoam targets you know with squirrels and stuff on them and he said
[57:42.480 --> 57:45.920]  yeah and when he was leaving Walmart he got lectured by the old lady please
[57:45.920 --> 57:50.920]  don't shoot squirrels and crows and he said well it's for target practice and
[57:50.920 --> 57:55.000]  the point is she had to lecture him you know this is all this anti-gun culture
[57:55.000 --> 57:59.920]  that's out there but but side-issue they care about animals but not about humans
[57:59.920 --> 58:04.840]  that's part of the dehumanization let's go to this next clip here they are with
[58:04.840 --> 58:09.280]  the puppy enjoying themselves and throwing it off the cliff
[58:09.280 --> 58:25.560]  and there's a celebration but we can't play the cussing so again face your
[58:25.560 --> 58:30.320]  crimes you want preemptive war you want police state the Constitution's bad

[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:19.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:27.440]  Alex Jones all right we are now in to hour number two it's gonna be open
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:31.920]  phones I haven't even gotten into the NDAA being shined how the media so-called
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:36.360]  media is trying to spin it while Obama demanded the indefinite detention of
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:40.320]  citizens being there that's tip of the iceberg by the way and then claimed he
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:43.640]  was against it but still signed it I'm gonna break this down it's key coming
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.360]  up bottom of the hour then we'll get into the latest on the austerity moves the
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:52.200]  central bank takeover some new order quotes I am wound up today and I'm gonna
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:56.960]  tie it into the record gun sales that are taking place and how the police can't
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:07.440]  even deal with one suspect they believe shot this park ranger and again it's
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:11.840]  like well why would he shoot friends at a party allegedly this this this this
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:17.680]  veteran of two tours in Iraq and then run off and just shoot a park ranger like
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:21.440]  they were nothing at a checkpoint to stop him because human life means
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:26.600]  nothing to him that's what's scary a lot of these guys people got screwed up in
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:31.600]  one tour in World War two you only serve one tour because after that it got bad
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:37.040]  for most people Vietnam you may be two three tours if you volunteered I know
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:40.960]  people that have served seven or eight tours and they get addicted to it because
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:45.200]  they're not living until like the hurt locker that's very accurate until they're
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:50.320]  in super danger some people can deal with it a lot of them can't they kill
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:55.440]  themselves they kill their families or they kill cops and what's gonna happen
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:59.280]  is the system's gonna start harassing veterans more now and it's gonna be
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:03.240]  like sticking your hand down a badger hole and it's gonna get worse and worse
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.600]  and worse which is exactly what the globalist want the social engineers they
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.800]  know what they're doing all right let's go to your calls Tim in Deutschland you're
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:14.240]  on the air from Germany hello happy new year from Germany thanks for your work
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:20.160]  Alex thank you yeah I want to endorse many of the perspective you give over
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.720]  the years in your programs from the German perspective what people in the
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:29.480]  United States should realize this we have the same stuff going here the rules
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:36.040]  that the attempts to control the internet bringing drones and UAVs into
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:40.760]  civil airspace the same stuff is happening here in parallel it's happening
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:45.640]  in Germany that they bring the UAVs now they just do it by the stroke of a pen
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:50.640]  they say it's just a piece of law concerning the aviation authorities but
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:55.840]  these drones can surveil us they can spy on us and they just bring them on yeah
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:00.600]  it's the unelected bureaucracies that on their boards have these internationalist
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:04.920]  that the Economist magazine calls for the technocrats to take over and they're
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:08.720]  preparing for war against us because that's the new economy that's the new
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:12.840]  system but no amount of drones and tinker toys they've got military drones
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:18.600]  within for red over this guy out in Washington State at Mount Rainier and
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.840]  okay drones hundreds of military militarized police and they can't stop
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:29.160]  one guy it's pathetic and the same thing is happening even with one Paul you
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:34.880]  regularly mentioned the speed with the really big drama magazine the same
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:40.080]  stuff and in ignorance towards Ron Paul the total absence of journalism is
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:44.440]  present here with him as well they they start talk about long gone Rick Perry
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:49.280]  and how influential he was in his campaign and they talk about Michelle
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:56.120]  Bachman and identify the Tea Party only with these stooges and completely
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:00.440]  ignore what Ron Paul says or how many Germans because they're afraid many
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:05.480]  terms would approach the non-interventionalism and even in Spiegel
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:10.720]  it's completely synchronized what what I see on Politico and other US that's a
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:14.760]  good word global standardization synchronization this is the global
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:21.320]  government everything we do is under UN UNESCO US EU it's all standardized it's
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.160]  the same groups everywhere we had this we used the attack on the Internet now
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:30.840]  with SOPA we used to have this Bilderberg and CFR plant mole of a German
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:36.480]  Secretary of Defense to Gutenberg and the guy was doing this DHT on a pretty
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.640]  much ripped off I tell you what Tim I want you to recap what you're saying
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.920]  finish your point we come back I'm gonna play this new Ron Paul attack yeah then
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:48.760]  we'll finish it with Tim then we'll go to Carol John Rudy Janice and others wide
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:53.400]  open phones I haven't even gotten into NDAA this is key what's coming up call

[01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:03.720]  to you this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:08.040]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:12.240]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:16.280]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.160]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:24.440]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:28.600]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.880]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:36.600]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:40.800]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:09.960]  is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:14.640]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have a tremendous
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:19.680]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:25.080]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full

[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:38.120]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists they're asking for more
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:42.040]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to. Today seems
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:47.680]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the

[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:23.240]  the United States, Australia, Germany, you name it. Here's an article up at
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:28.920]  infowars.com right now. Obama's NDAA signing statement is meaningless.
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:33.560]  Administration itself demanded power to turn American citizens without trial. It's
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:38.400]  an article by Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones. I worked on the article a bit
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:42.360]  with Paul this morning that Paul does the lion's share of the work. Appreciate
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:45.960]  him including me in the article and it just breaks down the facts. Very
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:50.840]  important article. I want to get to this article and then back to your calls. We
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:53.600]  had a caller from Germany who was making the point that there's totally
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:59.160]  synchronized drones over the population, you know the checkpoints, the cameras, the
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:02.960]  demonization of Ron Paul. Same thing worldwide. They're demonizing Ron Paul
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:07.240]  in Australia. I've seen articles because they're scared of those ideas picking up.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:16.080]  2006, 2008, 2011, our intel from three separate Bilderberg meetings was
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:20.600]  they're scared of Ron Paul. Not that he's gonna win from their perspective but
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:25.640]  because he's winning by resisting. By getting these ideas out it's like Holy
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:32.400]  Water to Nosferatu. That they are scared to death of this because the idea, the
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:38.080]  the anti-venom to what this new order Cobra has pumped into us is out there
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:44.000]  and if we discover it, the sword of truth, of common sense, of free market
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.320]  constitutionalism, bye bye New World Order. It's been the New World Order with
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:53.760]  NAFTA GATT, all these wars that's bankrupted us, that's destroyed us. And now
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:58.800]  here's an article Huntsman releases tacky glib twilight zone attack ad. I would
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:05.320]  say desperate Huntsman launches Ron Paul attack ad, claims New
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:09.600]  World Order doesn't exist but Huntsman releases tacky glib twilight zone
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:15.080]  attack ad in desperate bid to steal Ron Paul voters. If Ron Paul's foreign
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:19.280]  policy positions are out of the twilight zone that's what the ad does. Why does
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:26.480]  Paul get the most support from US military? By the way I remember in 1998
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:31.760]  they ran ads Texas-wide against him twilight zone with twilight zone music
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:37.320]  and going he wants kids to use drugs. You know he wants to get rid of the
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:43.480]  federal government. All misrepresenting what he says, misrepresent, I mean I saw
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:47.080]  an article in the Associated Press this morning saying Ron Paul believes there
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:53.720]  shouldn't be a space program. No, Ron Paul said it's not constitutional to pay
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:57.720]  for this giant space program and that private corporations should get into
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:02.600]  the business. We'd probably be much more advanced if they had. And of course
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:08.280]  they're weaponizing space but continuing here Huntsman has released this ad
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:12.920]  and either tonight or tomorrow night I want to go back and find George
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:18.320]  Herbert Walker Bush, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Herman von Roompi, head of the EU, all
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:22.840]  of them calling for a new world order and then saying that means global
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:29.400]  government. So here's Ron Paul in in-game saying yeah they want a new
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:34.080]  world order that's just what George Herbert Walker Bush called for. And so
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.520]  they have these clips from in-game and from C-span in places and they're
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:41.560]  airing this spending millions of dollars in Iowa acting like he's crazy. Look
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:45.480]  he's crazy. He says there's a global technocratic system run by mega banks
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:48.120]  being set up. We should get rid of the Federal Reserve and get our sovereignty
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:54.880]  back. Everybody knows that's nuts. When all Ron Paul is doing is reporting what's
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:59.540]  in the news. Yeah, he warned exactly what was coming 30 years ago. He was way
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:03.760]  ahead of the curve but now we're in this paradox where it's all happening. I mean
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:08.880]  I saw this weekend dozens of articles saying Ron Paul's nuts. He thinks they're
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.720]  going to put troops on the streets. There's already troops on the streets
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:15.320]  all over the country and TSA checkpoints. They're announcing they're going to use
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:20.280]  military domestically. It's in all the military publications but they these
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.880]  reporters talk to their readers and viewers and listeners like they're
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:29.200]  idiots. You know every once in a while I'll call in the local talk radio when
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.640]  they're talking about issues or when they're reading one of my articles and
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:37.320]  they always on two different talk stations I've called into they'll always
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:42.600]  play black helicopter noises or X-Files music or Empire Strikes Back battle
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:46.320]  theme and laugh at me while I'm talking but I'll let them do it still get the
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:50.240]  info out because then most the callers call in and add more data but oh look
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:54.240]  he's telling us exactly what's happening. Oh my gosh he's incredibly accurate. It
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.000]  all came true. Let's not say man we better listen to this guy. Let's attack
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.800]  him. Okay let's go ahead and play this new desperate huntsman. This is a
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:08.520]  guy that works for Obama. This is a big globalist. This is a guy seeing an MSNBC
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:14.440]  love and here he is implying Ron Paul lives in the twilight zone. No Ron Paul
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:19.120]  lives in the real world and the public starting to live in the real world and
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:22.720]  starting to go wait you're saying there's no new world order but I've heard
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:26.800]  all these leaders call for one. Ron Paul isn't allowed to say hey America should
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:31.660]  be run by Americans and not some offshore banks. Hey Ron Paul said NAFTA and
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:35.440]  Gat would be bad. He's not a Cooke. Remember they called Ross Peroa Cooke.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:40.440]  All they've got is name calling and they count on you being childlike. Here's the
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:48.080]  club of the Twilight Zone ad.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:56.720]  Ron Paul Chronicles. The assumption is that this guy is like your crazy uncle
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:00.000]  but you never expected your crazy uncle to get this far. The problem with him is
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.160]  that he's got some very sound points but then he's kind of I don't know in other
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.400]  areas scary. All I can say is you know people have written about this in the
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:12.640]  skull of the homes is a secret order of Yale and then the proposition is that
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:16.720]  people are there groomed for the trial at all commission and the CFR and
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:20.400]  therefore they will then be in positions of great influence in our
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:26.240]  government. President Bush said that the New World Order was in tune and
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:30.240]  that's what they were working for. 600,000 Americans died in the senseless
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:34.880]  civil war. You buy the slaves and how much would that cost compared to
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:39.000]  killing 600,000 Americans? If you look at the history you'll find out that Hamas
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.520]  was encouraged and really started by Israel. Have you ever read about the
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:47.960]  reasons they attacked us? They attack us because we've been over there. We've
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:52.320]  been bombing Iraq for 10 years. Are you suggesting we invited the 9-11
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:56.280]  attacks, sir? The Israelis are there. The United States is there. All these
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:00.720]  countries. China has nuclear weapons. Why wouldn't it be natural that they might
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:04.000]  want a weapon? There'd be internationally they'd be given more
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.360]  respect. Tune in next week for more of
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:25.400]  Iran Paul Chronicles. Okay. I mean what do you say to that? Harats? Reuters? Jerusalem
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:30.040]  Post? I mean you can type in Israel created Hamas into a search engine.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:37.520]  You'll get UPI? Israel admits that. Anyone watching that in Israel knows that in 1973
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:43.560]  as a counterbalance to Hezbollah, that's the Iranian back group, the Shiite
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:50.520]  back group, that Israel created Hamas. Ron Paul could have gone further. Israel
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:54.040]  staged terror attacks against itself, against its own public. Jerusalem Post,
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:16:00.640]  Harats, UPI. I mean just type in Israel created fake al Qaeda, staged attacks. I
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:08.040]  mean everything he said there was true. Every little piece was real, but they
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:13.160]  think you're stupid. They think you're idiots. They think you don't know about
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:19.600]  how the world works. Oh, Ron Paul's a kook. They had a clip from 20 years ago of
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:23.200]  him on TV being asked about sculling bones and he says, yeah, it's a secret
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:27.120]  society at Yale. Well, you've had four presidents come from there, a bunch of
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:33.640]  secretary of states. These are gangs. These are mafias. These are secret
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.640]  societies. The CFR trilateral commission openly called for world
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:41.760]  government, but you're not supposed to talk about it. Every, I mean we could
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:44.440]  dissect that clip. We won't have time to do it today. We'll do it maybe tomorrow
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:48.120]  night on the news and have it for Wednesday on the show where we could go
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:53.560]  through and show you articles and documents and video clips. In fact,
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:17:01.520]  call Rob doing here for me real quick, please. We can do part one tonight. The
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:06.240]  problem is every five seconds of the ad, I can back up what he's saying, but we
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:13.000]  could just at least... Hey, dude, come on in, bro. Have you seen the Sad Attack on
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.480]  Ron Paul? Okay, well the point is I know I wanted to get out here early today. I
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:21.240]  wanted to shoot the show and tape it, so doing it live, but obviously today or
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:24.480]  tomorrow, whatever. We need to show where they make fun of him about New World
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.480]  Order and show Herman. We already have the clips. Herman Von Rompe, calling for
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:32.080]  New World Order World Government. We need to show, you know, British
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:35.560]  Prime Minister calling for, we show Herbert Walker. Like show the clip and
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:38.720]  then go, oh, but here he is sitting. We're not supposed to talk about it. What's
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:43.120]  twilight zone is that they think their viewers are stupid, and then he's got
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:47.240]  the part... We'll just show two parts tonight. He's got the part where they go,
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:52.120]  oh my gosh, he thinks Israel founded Hamas. Just type in Israel created Hamas.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:57.920]  You'll get UPI, Reuters, AP, but more importantly, they'll say, oh, well that's
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:01.440]  anti-Semitic Reuters, you know, because we all know they're evil. Show them
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:07.240]  something like Jerusalem Post or Harats. I know it's in both those. And there's
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:10.160]  been connected debates where they gripe at people for creating it and all that.
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:15.440]  And then go one further. The headlines, Israel created fake Al Qaeda to attack
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:20.360]  themselves. That's in the Israeli papers. That's why the Israelis are rioting over
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:23.600]  there. The media acts like all the Israelis want war and love the tyranny.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:27.800]  They have a government staging stuff on them as well, and then funding terror
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:31.520]  groups or letting terrorists in as a pretext to keep control. Don't you see
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:35.680]  the paradigm do? I know you see it well. Okay, I'm ranting. Alright, thank you so
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:39.400]  much. Good job. Unbelievable. Let's go back to the caller in Jeremy, then I
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:43.200]  promise I'm coming back with more of your calls here. Tim, finish up the point
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:48.000]  you were making before the last break. Well, what I want to do rather is do an
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.240]  appeal to the citizens. Guys, preserve your rights. Defend the liberty you have.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:56.640]  Currently, resistance and success against the globalist comes cheap. Worse, it
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:01.200]  is going to happen to you. It's being ridiculed. It will be worse soon if you
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:05.360]  do not all kick into high gear. Call a politician each day or representative
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:10.160]  and form anyone you find. Being ridiculed is probably the worst that's
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:17.400]  going to happen, but soon it could be with NDDA, that NDAA, that looks like
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:22.800]  the enabling actor in Germany. The Hitler was only elected, but he wasn't in
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:27.480]  power and he wasn't the dictator. He wasn't elected dictator. He became one.
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:32.080]  He grabbed the power, just the same stuff that could and likely is to be
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:35.360]  happening in the United States currently. And you were saying you're seeing the
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:41.920]  same parallels in Germany? You know, I had you hold so long. We're coming back to you.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:43.880]  I'm gonna give you two minutes on the other side that I'm gonna get to everybody
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:48.760]  else's calls who's on the board. Then I'm getting into NDAA. I was up late last
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:52.480]  night, woke up middle of the night. I've got all these notes written up. A key
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:57.720]  report at 40 after exactly. I'm going to the NDAA report in 20 minutes, but your
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:03.040]  calls are straight ahead. Stay there, Tim. Hi, this is Peter Cranstrammel from
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.600]  Midas Resources. As you know, the federal government spending is at an all-time
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:10.440]  high and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy. European
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:14.040]  government and central bank spending policies have put the European Union on
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:17.000]  the brink of collapse. What are you doing right now to protect yourself
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000]  financially? Are your assets working for you or against you? One thing is certain.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.440]  Having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:28.040]  happens to our economy or the dollar, your investment will never be worthless.
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:32.000]  You know, protect you from that hidden tax, inflation. If you've been thinking
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.080]  about investing in physical possession of precious metals or having an IRA in
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:42.320]  precious metals, I can help. Call me today. Peter Cranstrammel at 800-686-2237

[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:13.720]  testosterone. That could explain a lot, like your low energy, muscle turning to

[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:09.240]  crisis. Everyone can feel it. We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:14.000]  between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.760]  enslavement. Yes, my friends, evil is rising. But take heart for every action
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:25.280]  there is an equal and opposite reaction. Recently, New World Order operative
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:30.200]  Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the Info War. We are in an information
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:35.280]  war and we are losing that war. The globalist are scared. They've overreached.

[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:20.160]  The Babylon system is the vampire sucking the children, sucking the blood of the
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:32.160]  children day by day. All right, I'm gonna get to the calls. I'm just really wound
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:38.000]  up here today, obviously. NDAA is now law, but they've passed laws that black
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.840]  people weren't humans in this country. They've passed laws in other countries
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:46.040]  that they could secretly arrest you and disappear you to a camp. And Tim in
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:50.480]  Germany was bringing up the Enabling Act, and yes, Hitler was what elected
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:57.600]  president, and then he blew up his own Reichstag building and had Kaiser
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:02.720]  Wilhelm sign over the chancellorship to, and I'm going from memory here, and then
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:07.720]  that he unified the presidency and the chancellorship into the furor, and then
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:12.400]  it still took him from February 27th when he did that, right through four or
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:16.480]  five years to really get dictator powers going. You live in Germany. Is that
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:21.040]  historically accurate, Tim? Well, well, the dates were a little bit later. He was
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:25.200]  a chancellor. You were right on that, but what I can tell you is I'm only 40 years
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:29.400]  old or becoming this year, but what I can tell you is a German. We always were
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:34.320]  taught in school. It was close to indoctrination, but then because of what
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:38.440]  happened in the Third Reich, I must say was partly okay, but we've always taught
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:43.200]  the question was, how could you allow that to happen? And think about yourself,
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:48.320]  the listeners, what will you be asked in 15, 10, five years if it's going to be
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:52.240]  fast, maybe less, or 20 years? What are your children? What are your grandchildren
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:56.840]  going to ask you? What did you do back then? What did you to prevent this from
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:01.360]  happening that could be happening, and that these people are madmen? You can see
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:06.800]  that bioengineering viruses, they genetically modify stuff that shouldn't
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:11.040]  be genetically modified, and they could bring anything up on us this year,
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:17.880]  because they seem to be prone on 2012 as a year of change for them. And I don't
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:23.120]  say it is likely, but everybody should be prepared for everything globally. They
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:28.480]  could just promote on CNN that the aliens have contacted us and tried to
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:32.040]  extort us, and because of that, they could release the flu. They could do
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:36.560]  anything. These are madmen. Exactly, exactly, because they're able to put out
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:42.200]  big hoax, have all their corporate liars put out a unified fraud, and then you're
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:45.840]  always battling the fraud, even though you prove it a lie later, it's just
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:50.160]  accepted as the pretext. God bless you, I appreciate your call. Here's a
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:54.560]  breakdown from the Future of Freedom Foundation. In the presidential election
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:59.240]  held, March 13, 1932, there were four candidates, the incumbent, Field Marshal
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:04.600]  Paul von Hindenburg, Hitler, and two minor candidates, Ernst, Thielman, and
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:11.200]  Theodore Duesenberg. The results were Hindenburg 49.6, Hitler 30.1, and then it
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:15.560]  goes from there. At the risk of belaboring the obvious, almost 70% of
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:19.800]  German people voted against Hitler, causing his supporter, Joseph Goebbels, who
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:22.560]  later became Hitler's minister of propaganda, LeMint and his journal,
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:28.720]  were beaten. Terrible outlook. Party circles badly depressed and dejected.
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:33.240]  Since Hindenburg had not received a majority of the vote, however, a runoff
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:40.280]  election had to be held among the three top getters. On April 19, 1932, the runoff
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:48.200]  results were Hindenburg 53, Hitler 36, Thielman 10.2, and then it just goes into
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:52.840]  how it was like parliamentary and they shared power and then they had the
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:56.080]  Reichstag fire and then Hitler got more power out of that and I was basically
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:01.320]  right. Yeah, and it goes over all of it. Hitler's rise to power and breaks it all
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:07.480]  down. And how he turned the judiciary into a tyranny. Okay, let's go back to
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:13.920]  your calls here. Let's talk to Carol and Pennsylvania. Thanks for holding.
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:19.080]  Happy New Year, Alex. Thank you, you too. I wanted to tell you about one thing that
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:24.240]  just came up on my radar and ask you about another one. Okay. I went out last
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:27.840]  week and all of a sudden, within a five mile radius, we got three of these
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:33.120]  creepy billboards. Don't lie for the other guy. It's a program between the
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:38.880]  alcohol, tobacco and firearms and national shooting sports foundation. You
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:42.320]  get 10 years in jail if you help somebody get a gun who shouldn't get one.
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:46.200]  Yeah, what they're doing is teaching people, they sell it like don't give a
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:51.880]  felon a gun or don't do a straw purchase, but now they're hyping it that if you
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:57.120]  give your grandson a gun or if you buy your wife a gun or you buy your dad a
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:00.920]  gun, I mean my dad's giving me guns, I've given him guns, that that's somehow
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:04.520]  illegal so the juries will send you to jail. They call it a straw purchase. It
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:08.440]  isn't really one, but I've seen them send people to prison for giving their grandson
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:12.000]  a gun. So yes, I've seen the creepy title-tale billboards going up
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.760]  everywhere. Came up with all these laws that any crime with a gun, you get five
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:21.080]  years, but help somebody get that gun, you get 10. But the other thing I wanted to
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:27.320]  ask you about, there's this Thrive movie, Thrive movement, and it's it's
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:33.160]  incredibly well-funded and it's run by Foster Gamble of the Proctor Gamble
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:38.200]  family. The guest list in this movie reads like your guest list, but my
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:42.080]  spidey senses are telling me this is you know the controlled opposition kind of
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:45.960]  thing. Sure, it's talking about a new economy and a new system that the
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:50.560]  globalists want to offer solutions to what they've done. Stay there. We're on
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:58.720]  the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:07.360]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and

[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:34.560]  detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called

[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:03.880]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:07.800]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:11.640]  that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:15.000]  gold? It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.800]  country, and it's possible they could even happen again. So our friends at
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:23.240]  Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds. They
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:28.280]  call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:32.000]  dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part, these seeds have
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.800]  not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:40.800]  plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:47.400]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:55.680]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:33:08.680]  ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:15.040]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:32.040]  the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:38.720]  Okay, I almost got Rob Dew, Aaron Dykes, and Rob Jacobson in here in studio, because
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:43.000]  we get tons of emails about the Thrive movie and the Thrive movement, and
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:48.720]  they've watched the film and basically gave me their synopsis, but I want to
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:53.040]  watch it before I pass judgment. I know it has the air of the Procter and Gamble
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:57.240]  fortune in it, but people always have a chance to wake up and turn things around.
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:00.880]  It has Catherine Austin Fitz and other... By the way, she's on the nightly news
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:06.080]  tonight. Other good people, Bill Still, who's put out the Money Masters and also
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:10.480]  the Secret of Oz. And so as we awaken people, there's going to be good guys
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:17.600]  from the power structure that come out. Rob and Aaron's breakdown is that it's
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:21.520]  basically Zeitgeist 2.0, that they admit the problems, they admit the
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:25.720]  world government. Well, it's out in the open now, you can't not admit it, but then
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:31.880]  it gets into UFOs, crop circles, which kind of discredits it and then kind of
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:36.880]  gives some new-agey solutions. You see, they tried to deny all this was going on,
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:42.040]  but the problem with Zeitgeist is it sells a technocratic computer who
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:46.720]  programs it that decides who gets what resources. And you live in these basically
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:50.920]  plastic cities. I mean, I can't think of a more hellish system. And if you've
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:54.200]  studied history, you know the communists back in the 20s and stuff always
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:59.040]  advertise their ideas with airships and spaceships and super science and it's
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:04.640]  going to be this wonderful new world and that's how they always advertise it. I
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.320]  mean, even the Economist magazine when they're selling technocracy says, well,
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:11.920]  the communists sold it as a science fiction technocracy and, you know, it
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:16.120]  didn't go too well, but our technocracy is going to do a really good job because,
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:22.120]  you know, the central bankers want to fix everything. So what's happening is
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:27.080]  there's a huge awakening taking place and so I think it's a mix of both. I have
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:30.880]  to see it before I can comment, but three crew members have seen it who are all
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:35.440]  smart people and they basically say the same thing. I mean, I don't think people
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:40.280]  are bad for being in it, but Carol, I have to not pass a judgment at this
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:44.200]  point because I haven't seen it, but briefly give us your take on it.
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:49.840]  Shoot, you got Gerald Salante and David Ike. I mean, it's a heck of a guest list, but I
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:54.880]  think the solutions are soft core. I think they're playing to the hands of, you
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:36:00.360]  know, global controlled organizations, you know, Sierra Club and, you know, that
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:04.240]  kind of, oh, it's like, quote, fix the environment. Everything's fixed. Well, do
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:09.560]  they admit GMOs, the real threat to the environment or, or is it carbon? No, it's
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:13.160]  a mix. I mean, it's not just about the environmental stuff, but they're hooking
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:16.960]  you up with the, you know, rainforest action network, Sierra Club. They do
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:20.680]  talk. Oh, well, that's all I needed to know because, you know, the Gamble family,
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:25.040]  they are the recipient of the Margaret Singer letters about getting rid of the
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:28.600]  black weeds. You know, Aaron looked at me during the break and he said, all I know
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:31.840]  is they're hooked in with Margaret Singer and the eugenicist. Now, I don't know
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:35.160]  about this guy individually, but if they're saying Sierra Club is going to
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:39.600]  save us, that is all about the land grab, all about new world order. Now, maybe the
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:44.760]  guy is a person waking up, but I don't know. Apples usually don't fall too far
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:49.600]  from the trees and might be loyal opposition. We'll have to look into it.
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:55.640]  No, but that's a big, big, big, big sign right there. See, I ought to be glad they're
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:59.080]  doing this though. If they don't at least try to co-op things, they're going to
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:03.800]  kill me because they know we are taking over. We are waking people up. We're the
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:09.320]  real deal, the real paradigm smashers. And so at least they're not just, you know,
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:13.040]  starting a war with us now or trying to wipe out the leadership of the patriot
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:17.560]  movement at this point. They're trying other things. And so, you know, at least
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:20.760]  they're, they're spinning their wheels because let me tell you, you're not turning
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:25.240]  this around. Once somebody has a paradigm shift and gets into reality, it's not
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:29.440]  like there has to be some new installment of awakening. People are on
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:33.800]  their own now waking up. It's like Ron Paul said on Fox News yesterday when they
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:39.320]  were attacking him. He said, listen, my, my supporters don't desert. My supporters
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:44.040]  don't just go away because once they put all this information together and see
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:49.240]  how the real world works, it's not Ron Paul. I'm just a focal point of this. It's
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:54.040]  a chain reaction. You can't put the genie back in the bottle and that's right. So,
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:58.280]  you know, good, good for the, good for Procter and Gamble Dynasty. Knock
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:04.880]  yourselves out. Mix some space aliens in and try whatever you want because for
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:09.520]  every action is an equal and opposite reaction. Let's thank you, Carol. Let's
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:15.520]  go ahead and go to Blue, listening on 1470 AM Truth Radio in Tennessee. You're
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:21.760]  on the air, Blue. Hey Alex, I pride myself on trying to find solutions. I'm the one
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:26.920]  that called in and expressed the need for everyone to turn their cell phones on,
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:31.120]  speakerphone when they're pumping gas and in the grocery stores to broadcast the
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:36.080]  message. These are a few of the ideas that I've come up with. One is to use
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:41.320]  Netflix. I heard about two years ago a gentleman that called in who had found
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:47.240]  you by watching the Obama deception on Netflix. I think that lots of Google
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:54.440]  bombs that we've had. If we all pick a movie and we all type it into Netflix
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:59.960]  search engines at the same time on the same day or as the equivalency of, then
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:05.800]  we can actually bring that through their algorithms and make it for, to bring it
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:16.200]  to the surface so that it's available to everyone. Two is to, the time to argue on
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:20.800]  talk radio with about one call is over. Right now we need to focus on the
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:24.960]  country music radio stations as well as the rock and roll stations and start
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:29.000]  pushing Patriot music and the reason why. Every time they give you an
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:34.320]  opportunity to request a song, request Amy's song, which was one call anthem
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:41.240]  from 2008 and bring this to the surface because these people are only hitting the
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:47.080]  sound lights of the news. And the third, the third idea is that you've got to go
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:54.000]  to your nightclubs and set up tables, register voters and be there to express
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.760]  one call point of view. Great points. Appreciate the call. Blue made a lot of
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:07.000]  really good points. Look, if you want to really change things, you've got to get
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.360]  involved in the streets. You've got to get involved at your church. You've got to
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:14.640]  get involved at work. You've got to talk about liberty. You've got to talk about
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:20.360]  real issues and point out what's happening everywhere. And the best tool,
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:27.320]  bar none, are documentary films. And that's why Obama deception, fall of
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:36.880]  Republic, in game terror storm, fabled enemies, Invisible Empire, all these
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:41.760]  films we've directed and produced will explain how the globalist control both
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:46.000]  parties will explain what their goals are, the different groups that work for
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:51.640]  them. So that then when some group comes to you posing as a patriot, I mean,
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:55.320]  here's one of the most positive things that's happened. That I've seen
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:41:03.640]  anywhere in the last few years is that whether it's Glenn Beck or Michael
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:07.960]  Savage or even Rush Limbaugh or these other talk show hosts, more and more
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:10.800]  they're talking about the New World Order. They're talking about global
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:13.360]  government. They're talking about the big mega banks. They're talking about
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:19.440]  crony capitalism. They're talking about real issues to keep their audience and
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:23.360]  to keep some credibility. Now they'll double back and attack Ron Paul at key
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:27.000]  points as we saw Savage do last week because that's where their bread is
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:33.320]  buttered is by the establishment. They're there to basically pose as alternative
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:39.720]  media that's controlled. But the fact that we're making them cover so many real
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:44.280]  issues just to keep their audience shows the fact that our information is
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:50.080]  gaining ground every day. And this attempt to make fun of Ron Paul because he
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:54.960]  talks about a New World Order, I mean, that's what we're facing. But the
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:59.240]  system wants to continue to operate like none of this is happening. It's a
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:03.280]  global corporate government being set up by mega banks that have bought off our
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:08.920]  governments. It's an illegitimate hijacking of our system. I'm going to go
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:15.520]  to John, Janice, Robert, Beth, Mike and others here in just a little while, but I
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:21.800]  need to go ahead and get into the NDA right now. Obama signed the National
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:27.480]  Defense Authorization Act in Hawaii with no ceremony. It was a private signing. He
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:31.800]  released it obviously in the evening of New Year's so that it wouldn't get a lot
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:38.120]  of coverage. And he signed it. That's line number one because he said he wouldn't
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:42.040]  sign it. He pledged, that was the term, pledged to veto. We have links to that in
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:46.240]  our articles dealing with this. So he pledged to veto it. And we have that
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:50.880]  broken down in our latest article at infowars.com. Obama's NDA signing
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:55.920]  statement is meaningless. Administration itself demanded power to
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:59.840]  take Americans without trial. We have links to the Congress, the senators
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:03.920]  breaking it down. We have the links admitting it's four U.S. citizens. I
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:08.000]  mean, Obama's already killing U.S. citizens without trials. And we're all
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:14.240]  a-locking and others. We're told to set the precedent. And it goes over all of
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:18.280]  that. So first they said it didn't affect U.S. citizens. They lied about that.
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:22.520]  Obama said it did affect citizens. He would veto it. Then he did sign it. Then
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:26.600]  he lied again and said, I'm signing it, but don't worry. I'm not going to
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:34.400]  implement it because of our cherished values. No, it's our laws. That's
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:39.320]  another lie. He's already implemented it. They've already said in policy that
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:42.080]  they'll arrest U.S. citizens, that they'll disappear into a black hole.
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:46.080]  Because that was the quote, policy of Bush. You know, when Bush got caught
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:50.480]  illegally wiretapping the American people, he went to Congress and had him
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:54.960]  write a retroactive law saying it was legal. Well, you can't pass laws that
[01:43:54.960 --> 01:44:03.560]  members of Congress can kill their wives. You can't pass laws saying Hispanics
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:09.240]  will now be slaves or people with English surnames will now be slaves or
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:13.960]  Amish will be slaves or South Africans will be slaves. You have an
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:18.560]  inherent right to not be a slave. When somebody says it's the law, I can
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:25.280]  secretly arrest you. They are tyrants. They are frauds. They have run up their
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:30.000]  flag. You know who they are. But I want to address something else here.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.400]  Everybody is starting to really freak out. And I'm asking it all over YouTube,
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:38.880]  all over the comments on Info Wars, the emails, the calls, family calling, people
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:42.640]  apologizing on the street, people buying me dinner at restaurants saying, I
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:45.600]  thought you were cooked five years ago. It's all coming true. And they're
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:50.840]  freaking out thinking the federal government is coming tomorrow because
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:54.400]  the ACLU has come out and Ron Paul has come out and now the media has had to
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:58.240]  admit, okay, it does end Posse Com and Todd has put troops on the streets. It
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:03.560]  does declare the whole world a war zone. And it gives the president all this
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:07.920]  power. This is really a war power to Obama. I mean, there's so many facets to
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:11.600]  this, you can't even cover them all. It says the president can launch attacks
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:14.920]  anywhere in the world without any congressional approval or even discussion.
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:20.200]  So that's a huge violation of the war powers. So worldwide declaration of war,
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:25.280]  end of war powers coming from Congress, huge seizure of power, declares the end
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:30.240]  of Posse Com and Todd is domestically the US a battlefield, says US citizens can
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:36.280]  be tortured, disappeared, never seen again. End of habeas corpus in the bill of
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:40.280]  rights, end of constitution. And now finally it's being admitted a lot of
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:44.880]  mainstream news. So people are going, whoa, Alex, you were right. I thought you
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:49.440]  were crazy. My God, they're coming to get me tomorrow. No, they're not coming to
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:54.520]  get you. Why do you think, oh, tomorrow, why do you think Obama lied about this
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:58.520]  and said he was going to veto it? And then they had surrogates in the media say,
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:02.800]  don't worry, it doesn't affect citizens. They wanted to sneak that through to have
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:06.880]  it on paper so they could start brainwashing police and military to
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:11.600]  find out who will follow the order. They want to quietly do this behind the
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:15.080]  scenes. They don't want to have a big debate about what they're doing. They're
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:19.640]  weak and that's the key to all of this. If you're anything I say in my hours of
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:27.920]  covering news and information, it's this. They are doing this. I mean, I went to
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:31.840]  bed at about 1130 midnight last night. I woke up at 3 a.m. and wrote four pages of
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:35.120]  notes on this. Just woke up with a brainstorm and I already knew all of
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:42.560]  this, but it hit me. I woke up at like 3 a.m. going, we're winning. Sure, they lied
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:46.520]  to us out of hand. Sure, they like to train us to accept lies. Sure, they use
[01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:50.120]  military parlots against their enemy, the American people, these foreign banks that
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:53.640]  run our military. So they're going to lie to us out of hand to create a fog of
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:58.520]  confusion, to make things about the fog of confusion instead of ever debating,
[01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:02.680]  hey, can the military be on the streets? Can citizens be secretly arrested? And
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:08.280]  that's also done by the psycho-idiot savants that run this to make people that
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:13.120]  are awake feel helpless to know the bill really does this and then to not even
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:18.240]  be able to have a real debate about it. So it's designed for people that don't
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:22.800]  really pay attention to just get confused and wander off and then they drive up in
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:27.320]  Tennessee or Illinois or Texas, Florida. I mean, all over the country now it's in
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:31.520]  the news, local news, never national because they're not ready for that yet.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:34.760]  You just pull up and there's the armies there and they're searching everybody's
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:42.240]  cars. This was going on in 1997 in Texas, 1998. We have video of army checkpoints
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:46.240]  and Mike Hansen's up there driving back from Dallas. He drives through Belton.
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:49.280]  There's an army checkpoint. He pulls over and the troops run over and say, turn
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:56.240]  your cameras off. It's all in the takeover happened to me in Belton at a
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:48:01.760]  military checkpoint and the army soldiers come over and say, I don't like you
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:05.320]  having your camera on and thought I was going to cower and wet myself. I got right
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:09.280]  back in his face and he said, you guys were at Belton and showed my
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:12.400]  face on TV, I'm angry. And I said, buddy, you shouldn't be out here on the
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:22.240]  streets. It always started for ordinance control, quote, to defuse bombs, but an
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:27.680]  FBI agent pulls up, gets out of the car and says, here's why they're here. Now,
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:32.880]  get out of here and accidentally gave us a restricted document that's actually in
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:37.760]  the takeover that says the military is operating in all 50 states covertly.
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:41.520]  We're here for any reason. Checkpoints warrant service kicking down doors.
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:48.480]  This is warrant service. We're here. A giant covert operation, 1998 in all 50
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:56.800]  states. This one's run out of Fort Hood in Texas. And it says, we're here 24
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:02.640]  hours a day, seven days a week. This is a quote, 300 plus days a year. We're here
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:10.000]  365 days a year. We're here for you. And you better believe I got freaked out by
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.080]  that. Then I went to the urban warfare drills. I said, I better look into this.
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:17.680]  Who are they trying to fight? The American people. So now this is all
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:22.960]  manifesting. So they want these powers to train behind the scenes and to get the
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:26.400]  cops and military ready to do this treason, but they don't want a public
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:29.840]  debate. They don't want opposition mounting to it. They don't want people to
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:34.400]  realize how evil it is. So Obama says, don't worry. I'm going to veto it to kill
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:38.960]  opposition to me. Don't worry. Cease fire. We're not going to pass it so they could
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:44.400]  pass it. People then say, don't worry it passed, but he won't sign it. He signs it.
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:48.080]  Why did he sign it? We know from Carl Levin and others because they ordered it
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:52.400]  be in there before it was going to be the military and Congress and the
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:57.280]  government could secretly arrest. And Obama said, no, the executive because
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:01.520]  they want that dictatorial power all to them. Tyrants always fight over the
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:08.080]  power. So now it's in that one office. So we now have this here as a wake up
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:11.200]  call. But the next spin will see all they pass
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:14.160]  secret arrest of citizens, but nothing happened. Yeah, they're going to wait till
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:16.720]  they stage terror attacks to blame it on domestic groups.
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:18.880]  They're going to wait till they launch a new big war.
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:22.720]  They're going to wait till things implode further
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:28.240]  to then have the test case where this guy that reportedly shot the ranger and
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:33.200]  shot people up in Washington state. I'm going to cover him when we come back.
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:37.680]  That could be a test case. Oh, he shot a federal officer and he's
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:41.440]  bad and you know what? He doesn't deserve a proper trial
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:44.320]  because he's a he's a killer of a federal agent.
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:47.120]  And that's what they did with the Patriot Act. Remember Patriot Act? It's a
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:50.640]  handbook, a blueprint, a playbook. Remember they said, hey, we're nice
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:53.920]  not going to affect citizens. We said says right here, Section 802.
[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:57.360]  No, you're a conspiracy terrorist. Then they immediately started using it
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:00.880]  against citizens and non-terror related.
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:04.320]  Did you know nuclear radiation is still spewing out of the melted down
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:08.240]  reactors in Fukushima, Japan and making its way across the entire U.S.
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:11.200]  continent? Contaminating the air, water, and food?
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:14.960]  Dangerously high levels of radiation are a reality here. As a result,
[01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:18.960]  radiation poisoning is a distinct possibility for anyone living in the U.S.
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:23.200]  unless you do something to protect yourself. How? With Liquid Zeolite from

[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:34.880]  Okay, we are back here. I wrote a lot of notes concerning this.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.960]  Why do they lie on NDAA? What is the formula? Confuse the enemy. That's us.
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:43.760]  Our government has been taken over by foreign banks. Get that through your head.
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:47.360]  They are weak and they want to slip it in slowly.
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:52.720]  They are waiting for a good test case to sell it to the public to roll it out.
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:59.360]  They are waiting for the right crisis to bring this system out to the full public.
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:04.960]  They are already killing U.S. citizens extrajudicially and saying they'll do it domestically.
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:07.680]  They were already doing everything that's in the NDAA.
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:14.320]  And again, why are we surprised by all Obama does is lie? He said he'd veto it.
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:21.440]  Then he signs it. Now, he says, don't worry, I won't implement this though. It's up to me.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:27.760]  He'll lie to you there because that's what they do. That is their formula.
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:32.960]  And I mentioned the Patriot Act. You can just type in Patriot Act use in non-terror-related cases.
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:36.400]  We've done an analysis. Thousands of times per state per year,
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:40.400]  they just violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution. They have Time Magazine Newsweek
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:44.880]  putting the Constitution down. They actually tell people on the news the central bankers
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:50.240]  will fix our problems and the Constitution is what caused them and then give no proof
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:52.720]  when it's the banksters that did this.
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:00.880]  Now, I want to get to this article out of the Seattle Times, massive manhunt after
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:12.400]  Ranger slain outside Mount Rainier. And there's a photo of the soldier and it's,
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:17.520]  he's got his evil assault weapons and oh my gosh, it is terrible. There was a late night party
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:21.600]  and supposedly a bunch of people got shot at that event.
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:29.040]  And then the main suspect raced away in a car and he drove past a checkpoint.
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:35.520]  So another lone Ranger parked in front of him blocking him on the road in the park.
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:41.440]  So he's the main suspect in shooting her. It said the SWAT team waited hours,
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:48.080]  waited hours, even though they were there to go up and help her because they were afraid he might
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:54.720]  shoot them. I mean, what did you sign on for this for? I mean, nowadays if we had a UT tower
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:59.280]  shooting, it'd be three days for the SWAT team went in waiting for the feds to arrive and tell
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:03.280]  them what to do. In the old days, people just charged in there and killed the guy. Citizens
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:08.960]  started firing, keeping him pinned down. Nowadays, in fact, it says here, I was reading this earlier
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:14.640]  in the day, just a massive amount of time that they sat there and then it is buried in the
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:22.560]  article. It's always buried that he served two tours in Iraq. I meant to actually highlight
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:28.880]  this article today and I tried to do it during the breaks. Yeah, he was shooting at them for 90
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:32.240]  minutes while they were trying to help the lady. You know, that's my point. They didn't go up there
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:36.960]  and take the guy out. In the old days, they would just gone up to where he was at. I mean,
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:44.720]  what was it? Like three hours they waited in the Blacksburg, Virginia thing outside waiting for
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:48.320]  the feds an hour and a half to get there. And then once the feds got there, they all dressed in
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:53.600]  their body armor and waited. And by then it was all over. I mean, this is the type of stuff that
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:58:03.760]  goes on. But they break it down here in the article that, you know, the mother-in-law was
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:12.640]  worried about him and tried to get a restraining order and said he had PTSD from Iraq. It says
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:18.560]  he was deployed in Iraq in 0708 and has possible PTSD issues. Look, they won't even say what,
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:23.680]  whether he was a Marine or Army. So it's got one line in there about it. And this is another one
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:31.600]  of their machines breaking down. And the point is it says 100 feds and more. And they're talking
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:36.080]  about, well, we're not really, you know, hunting him right now because he's so dangerous. My point is
[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:47.200]  we'll break it down when we come back. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:56.240]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:59:00.800]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions. Yet many are unaware of the entire function
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:05.120]  of the Silver Lungs system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere
[01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:11.040]  in or on the body. My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs generator.
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:16.560]  Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:20.400]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:26.320]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas. This includes the eyes,
[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:32.080]  ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system.
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:39.920]  Be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs system at www.silverlungs.com
[01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:42.320]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs system works.
[01:59:42.320 --> 02:00:02.320]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:21.840]  So does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:27.200]  All right, New Year's resolution is to take more calls, something I'm not good at. Your
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:37.760]  calls are coming up in a moment, 800-259-9231. My point is you got one guy reportedly who shot
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:45.680]  some people at a party in a gun battle. That's what the police believe. He runs off into a national park
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:54.000]  and the folks of the national park try to stop him. He reportedly kills a park ranger.
[02:00:54.640 --> 02:01:00.560]  And then you read the article. It says the feds have got a drone looking for his infrared
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:05.200]  and they haven't found him and then he's so dangerous, you know, they're they're still
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:11.440]  theoretically, you know, thinking of what they need to do before they go in. This is one guy
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:17.600]  with some guns who's willing to use them. All these people go, oh, they've got drones and
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:23.440]  helicopters. Oh, no one can defeat the federal government. If there's a civil war, they're
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:27.440]  going to come and they're going to get us know what they're going to do is shut down the cities
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:34.160]  and let people start starving. That's all they can do is barricade cities. You try to send people
[02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:41.600]  out door to door to take guns and it's over. The American people know what's going on. They're
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:46.720]  arming to the teeth. Most the military are great men and women and they know what's going on. They're
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:52.720]  donating to Ron Paul and record numbers. But what do you do when you get pulled over by some crazy
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:57.200]  cop? It happens all the time to people who's been in Iraq and Afghanistan for five tours
[02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:03.360]  and you argue with them about the fact that you weren't speeding. So they taser you and
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:08.640]  break your jaw or kill you. You've seen these videos of these high and tight. They're always
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:16.720]  former vets totally crazed and they pull somebody over and don't like what you say and they go crazy
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:24.240]  on you. I mean, that's the old thing of after World War II in Korea and Vietnam in every community.
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:30.720]  It was like, leave that guy alone. He's an old vet. Leave old Bobby alone. He'll go crazy on you
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:37.280]  because they don't care. They'll just start killing people. You don't just kill a bunch of people and
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:44.320]  do all this stuff and then it stops. You get addicted to it. Not that you even like it on average,
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:49.680]  but that it's what you know how to do. That's why you don't want a military domestically because
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:58.320]  a military kills people and breaks things. A peace officer defuses, helps communities,
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:05.360]  and then uses force if they have to. Because when you use force on somebody, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:13.200]  it comes back on you. When you use force on somebody, even in the right, it leaves scars on you.
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:17.280]  But if you do things except for the most evil people, and that's a very small percentage,
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:21.120]  most of our troops that are even doing bad stuff are not bad people. Most of the police
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:26.640]  who are doing bad things aren't evil people on average. They're delusional. They're stressed out.
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:35.440]  They're crazy. And the last group they need to be hiring as police are combat troops that have
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:40.480]  served more than two turrets. It might be good to have cop who's been in the military servitor
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:48.320]  if they aren't crazier than a bloody march here. But they want the, quote, tough guys that'll crack
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:52.560]  the heads of the American people. They try to soup them up. They try to get them in a combat
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:56.000]  stance towards the American people. And I'm going to tell you right now, we're going to break them
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.400]  back to your calls. I'm going to tell you right now what's going to happen.
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:07.440]  As more park rangers get killed, as more cops get killed, as the police get more and more
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:13.440]  paranoid about the public and see us as the enemy and see veterans as the enemy, there's a paradox.
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:17.840]  The police are full of veterans, but they're also taught the veterans are the number one threat.
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:22.640]  And in a way, it's true because they're trained killing machines who are committing suicide in
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:29.840]  mass at record numbers. And then as you push them, they're going to blow gaskets and start killing you
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:36.000]  and then the police act even crazier towards the public. And then it's off to the races.
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:44.160]  Deescalation is the key word here because if we have a civil war here, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:48.800]  it's only going to help the globalist. We need to reach out to police and military now
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:55.120]  and educate them about these facts. And it's the truth. They'll totally click. It's easy

[02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:07.280]  Genesis Communications Radio Network probably presents the Alex Jones show because there's a
[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:17.520]  war on for your mind. Okay, finishing up with the NDAA and how it ties into Americans by record
[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:24.960]  number of guns for Christmas and how that ties into this report out of the Seattle Times.
[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:31.680]  Massive manhunt after ranger slain at Mount Rainier. Late night gun battle
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:41.520]  at a late night party. The suspect's trying to hide out in the woods. The ranger set up a
[02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:45.920]  roadblock. He goes around them, comes to a second roadblock, gets out, shoots the ranger
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:49.440]  from concealment, starts shooting at the SWAT teams and police that arrive.
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:54.800]  He has been found dead. They don't know if he committed suicide or if he died from wounds
[02:08:55.360 --> 02:09:01.040]  in the shootout. But this just came out. Pierce County officials say the Iraq war vet, notice
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:07.200]  they won't say Marines or Army, being shot in the killing of a Mount Rainier National Park ranger
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:11.680]  has been found dead in a ditch near his car at the crime scene. Yeah, they probably killed him
[02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:18.560]  in the gun battle, but they waited just forever to even go up around it. Continuing, some 200 SWAT
[02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:22.960]  officers, police and rangers and Mount Rainier National Park in Washington State were searching
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:27.760]  Monday for an Iraq war veteran suspect in the killing on Sunday of a ranger.
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:36.080]  So it took him over to day. Highlights from news coverage. So it's all broken down there.
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:44.000]  So he was dead in a ditch for more than a day right there, and they wouldn't even go up by
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:48.960]  the car. And that was the, that just confirms what I was saying earlier. Hundreds and hundreds,
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:55.360]  I said over a hundred feds with hundreds of other local police, all just saying we're not even going
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:10:01.280]  to try to go down the road. He might get us. Oh, bring in the drones. And again, I'm just saying
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:06.400]  it's a change in policing. Because in the old days, people didn't have to talk about how macho
[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:10.080]  they were all day. And the old days police were trained just to charge in. You know, if you got
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:15.760]  shot, that's what you signed up for. Yeah, the tower shooting is a great example. We've actually
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:19.920]  had that Texas Ranger in here. He was an Austin cop at the time. And the locals all just got out
[02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:23.840]  their guns and kept the guy pinned down, or he would have killed many more. And the police just
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:27.920]  went right up the tower and right up there to kill the guy. And by the way, he started shooting at
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:35.840]  him. And they just went in with, took him out with shotguns. But I mean, Blacksburg, it was over
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:40.800]  three hours they sat there while he was in there killing people. And then, and then they say, don't
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:46.560]  have guns. And then they said they locked the park down and wouldn't let people get out while he was
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:52.240]  doing it miles away. I mean, look, I'm in a national park. And they say, we're locking you in the
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:56.800]  basement for a day because somebody's got a gun. I'm like, no, I'm not going to sit here and wait
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:11:02.480]  in the basement for somebody somewhere in a park to come kill me. The answer is guns to protect
[02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:08.320]  yourself from people like this. Now, to be clear, the average military man and woman is incredibly
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:14.720]  dedicated to all the statistics of their hardworking good people. But if you put them in more than
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:22.400]  two or three tours, statistically, people start to get really screwed up. That's just PTSD. It's
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:30.160]  a real deal. My issue is this is a problem reaction solution paradigm. The social engineers know full
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:36.400]  well when they have people serve two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine tours. I was on that
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:47.200]  aircraft with that Air Force MP captain. He was going to bury his buddy at Fort Hood. They had to
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:50.960]  cast him on board the Southwest Airlines craft. I talked to him for three hours flying back from
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:59.280]  that video shoot in Las Vegas with Jesse Ventura. He talked about how he was going into his ninth
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:07.760]  tour since 9-11. Ninth tour and how his buddy had been in nine and finally got blown up by a roadside
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:14.240]  bomb or was it in Afghanistan? He'd been in Iraq, hadn't been with his buddy in over a year.
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:20.000]  Again, the Austin police know about this because they were all there to pick up the casket and
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:25.440]  take it to Fort Hood with a big parade or whatever. If you really cared about the trip, she wouldn't
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:29.200]  have him serve tour after tour. I said, well, what's it like being an Air Force MP? He goes,
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:32.880]  in these countries, we're the ones that have to drive the convoys through. We're the ones that
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:36.240]  have to guard the bases. We're the ones that actually get attacked all the time. He said,
[02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:41.360]  now in all branches of the armed service, you're facing combat. It's not like there's the enemy.
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:45.040]  We're going to go have a big war with them. It's the worst type where it's just extreme boredom
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:50.160]  and then somebody starts shooting at you or throws a hand grenade or this is what's going on.
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:55.520]  So the system knows you're going to get a percentage of these vets that come back
[02:12:56.080 --> 02:13:00.480]  who are going to engage in all this violence and they're going to use those guys to demonize all
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:05.040]  the veterans and go after all the veterans generally and try to restrict them from having
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:10.560]  the second amendment. And that's already happening. It's having people with no criminal record,
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:15.840]  no problem. They're going in to buy a gun. They can't. But the other group of PTSD people,
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:21.520]  they're being taken and made actually the many cases, the really bad apples, they're being made
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:26.880]  police. And so they're the people that you pull, you know, that pull people over and you see the
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:32.720]  person barely even ask a question and the cop drags them out and starts beating them or shoots
[02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:39.680]  them or tasers them because they're crazy and they have an appetite now for violence just to
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:44.400]  feel normal because if you've been involved in violence over and over and over and over and over
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:51.600]  again, you expect for it to happen some more just so you feel normal. In fact, guys, you can pull
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:55.840]  it up. Just type in record number of suicides. The last time I saw the number two weeks ago,
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:14:03.760]  it was seven times any previous number, seven times. And so the system knows they're all coming home
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:09.440]  and so they're going to have one group of veterans and the police attacking another group
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:16.320]  of veterans who are quote civilians and it is just a nightmare scenario. But the big nugget here,
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:22.960]  the big point I want to make here today is this. Under NDAA, they've already had it going on for
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:31.360]  six, seven years, regular army at checkpoints, army helping cut people out of cars, army doing
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:36.800]  all this PR stuff so the rollout can be sold to the public. But in the real manuals that are now
[02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:42.320]  been released to everybody, it's all about veterans, gun owners, libertarians, conservatives,
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:49.360]  Ron Paul supporters. It's the veterans that have got their act together. It's the veterans that
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:55.280]  know who the enemy is. You are the enemy and you are going to be blamed and demonized for these
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:59.600]  other people, the people that are throwing the puppies off the cliffs, the people that are
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:08.080]  blowing up the Iraqi families. How do I know this? From constant research, constant research.
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:15.040]  I remember how they hired people for Abu Ghraib. It came out in the army investigation. The federal
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:22.240]  government went around in 2002 in the buildup to the war and then in 2003 right before it started
[02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:28.160]  in March and would hire former federal and state guards who had been caught abusing people and
[02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:35.920]  raping people. And they said, you want another job? How about triple the pay? So see, the government
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:41.920]  is looking for the bad guys that'll bomb an Oklahoma city, that'll rape a child, that'll do
[02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:45.200]  this kind of stuff and they're trying to get rid of all the good people that are in government
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:49.120]  just like Stalin and Hitler opened up the prisons and put criminals in charge.
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:55.920]  This is what they're doing. But I got a message to all those people. What do you
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:16:00.480]  think is going to happen? And it's already starting. When the system tries to crack down on
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:08.240]  lawful gun owners and veterans, it is an unwinnable scenario for the globalist. If you think that
[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:13.840]  they care about the troops and police, they don't know. They want this country to descend
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:18.720]  into a banana republic. They've planned the whole deal. They want the civil insurrection.
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:24.160]  They think they know how to deal with it. And this is one of the false flag events they want
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:30.000]  is a civil war in this country and we've got to avoid it. They know full well when they send
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:33.680]  people off to five, six, seven, eight, nine tourists, you're going to get a lot of unstable
[02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:37.840]  people coming back. All right, let's go to the calls. I've been holding the longest.
[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:40.640]  Janice and then John. Janice in Texas. Thanks for holding. Welcome.
[02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:43.760]  Hi, Alex. Happy New Year. Happy New Year to you.
[02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:50.000]  My New Year's resolution was to give up C-SPAN. And I was editing through like all these
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:57.200]  meetings that I hadn't watched before and I came across something so absolutely horrifying. It
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:17:03.920]  left me trembling. It was the title of the meeting is the Joint Chiefs of Staff Expansion Proposal.
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:09.600]  And, you know, it's about giving the National Guard a chair at the Joint Chiefs and what the
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:15.600]  National Guard could do domestically under Title X and Title 32. And then they're all fighting and
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:22.880]  Lindsey Graham, it's Lindsey Graham's turn and he is so completely high and crazed out of his mind.
[02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:29.440]  His eyes are like glass and he keeps licking his lips and his shoulders are jerking back and forth
[02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:34.240]  and he's like yelling at the Joint Chiefs and telling him it's not up to them. It's up to him.
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:38.720]  And anyway, it's just something. Well, I'll tell you what, what was the date of this because they
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:44.400]  are under Northcom rolling National Guard, not giving them a seat, but actually taking them away
[02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:48.640]  from the governors and the legislatures. And that's in the John Warren Defense Authorization Act
[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:54.080]  07. They admit it's for civil unrest by the legislatures. They're saying, legislatures,
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:59.200]  if you try to exercise your ninth or tenth amendment, we're going to occupy you. That's why
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:04.400]  they now have the puppet 10 member governor and the rural council. But I've seen Graham,
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:11.040]  and if he's not on amphetamines or cocaine or something, I'm an Easter Bunny. If we're going
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:14.640]  to play the clip again tonight where he talks about how he wants people scared and you bet it's
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:22.080]  for citizens and the NDAA. And looking at his face, he looks like he's not drunk because I've
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:27.840]  seen one where Lieberman looks like he's drunk. But Graham looks like he's hopped up on something.
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:34.320]  It may just be power though, Janice. I'm not sure. I've been on the red with rock and roll bands
[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:40.160]  my whole life and I've seen high on hopped up. I mean, and he is hopped to the nines. It's like
[02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:44.960]  criminal insanity. Had a got together with cocaine and had a baby and named it Lindsey Graham.
[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:50.240]  I mean, I mean, I've looked at his eyes on TV and on and up the he is crazy,
[02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:55.520]  sweating and jerking around and you bet it's for America. Santa says, I want to be scared.
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:19:00.400]  I mean, I even talked about that last week. So what else happened in this meeting?
[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:06.720]  Well, all what you were just saying, like there was way too much for me to take it all in. That's
[02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:11.120]  why I wanted you to have a look at it because they talk about North com. The joint chiefs do not
[02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:17.520]  want the National Guard, you know, to have a chair there. And they say North com is like, you know,
[02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:23.360]  part of it that takes care of it. And Lindsey Graham saying no, no, no. And, you know, basically,
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:30.880]  you know, it all this all happened like two weeks before they passed the NDA. And I wouldn't have
[02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:35.680]  like if I when you watch Lieberman and all of them, they are shaking with power trips.
[02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:43.280]  Whenever they passed the NDA in the Senate, Jay Rockefeller, it was just super excited. It was
[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:48.240]  like, I mean, I mean, they know what they're doing. I've seen famous newsreels of Hitler,
[02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:51.840]  when he was taking over Czechoslovakia and stuff, they're walking around rubbing their hands together
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:58.400]  and give me the date of that so I can pull that up on the C-SPAN archives when we come back.
[02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:01.120]  Any other points you want to add, then I'm going to go to John and others.
[02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:06.240]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm. This time warns of Greek-style U.S. debt
[02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:11.680]  crises. You heard me right. The GAO is drawing a parallel between the U.S. economy, its debt,
[02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:16.320]  and the current Greek economic meltdown. With the debt the GDP chart climbing into
[02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:21.280]  unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will rise to unsupportable levels.
[02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:27.040]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. The federal debt and risk of financial crisis document the CBO has
[02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:32.320]  published is a must read for every American. Covering the risk of continued deficit spending
[02:20:32.320 --> 02:20:37.600]  coupled with an aging population and the rising interest rates spell economic disaster,
[02:20:37.600 --> 02:20:42.480]  it's imperative that you get a copy of this document and study it for yourself. Call me today
[02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:52.240]  at 800-686-2237 and I'll send you a free copy. Again, call 800-686-2237 and ask for your copy
[02:20:52.240 --> 02:20:59.360]  of the CBO document. Once again, you need to read this government report. Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:08.000]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:12.480]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear because there's never been a
[02:21:12.480 --> 02:21:18.240]  better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead. Here's why. Solar power generators
[02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:23.120]  are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors. Their
[02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:28.160]  emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most. Unlike
[02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:33.600]  gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes and produces electricity from the
[02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:38.480]  sun. It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own own, whether it's
[02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:43.920]  ice storms, brownouts or blackouts. You'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:21:43.920 --> 02:21:48.800]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions
[02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:54.880]  from Science. Go to MySolarBackup.com for more information. That's MySolarBackup.com or call
[02:21:54.880 --> 02:22:06.640]  877-327-0365. You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis. Everyone can feel it.
[02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:12.880]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love
[02:22:12.880 --> 02:22:21.280]  darkness, bondage and enslavement. Yes, my friends, evil is rising. But take heart for every action
[02:22:21.280 --> 02:22:27.120]  there is an equal and opposite reaction. Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted
[02:22:27.120 --> 02:22:33.040]  they're losing the Info War. We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
[02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:39.600]  The globalists are scared. They've overreached. The future of the Info War is in your hands.

[02:22:56.240 --> 02:23:00.240]  system against them. The Info War now goes into high gear.

[02:24:06.720 --> 02:24:10.720]  I haven't really gotten into the economic news or the latest on Iran.
[02:24:12.800 --> 02:24:17.920]  Or what's happening with the polls. Ron Paul Silla, number one. Politico got caught claiming that
[02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:22.560]  Paul was in number three when he was number one in the poll. They're going to trial sorts of dirty
[02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:28.000]  tricks. The Republicans are going to count the votes in secret. Republican establishment. They
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:34.720]  are really, really scared. But yes, years ago when I had more time, I was addicted to C-SPAN.
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:40.640]  I mean, that's how I knew TSA was going to be on the streets nine years ago. That's how I knew
[02:24:40.640 --> 02:24:45.120]  they were going to start making people go through the government to be able to have a job, a quote,
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:50.080]  homeland security, because I watched a two hour meeting with the whole thing being planned out.
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:55.040]  And I mean, that's what's frustrating is that the media
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:04.240]  will debate say five degrees of a 360 degree system. They'll act like they're debating with
[02:25:04.240 --> 02:25:08.240]  the Republican and the Democrat on the show, whether it should be done like this or that.
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:13.120]  But they're only debating one little bitty area that basically does the same thing regardless
[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:18.720]  of what decision is made. And they create these fake consensus where, you know, they have the
[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:24.000]  consensus with all the talking heads debating, well, when do we strike Iran? And then they have,
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:30.240]  you know, debates about it, but never why are we striking Iran? Or why are we being lied to again?
[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:39.200]  And the controlled corporate media, the dinosaur media, has total disdain for the public.
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:47.600]  Total disdain. Jan is finishing up. What was the name of the hearing again? And when was it?
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:52.560]  Because now you can search everything. In the last few months, they've upgraded the C-SPAN website
[02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:57.040]  where you can search it with the name and date and find anything, you know, right there on the
[02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:03.280]  site, the video, everything. Yeah, if you just go to C-SPAN.org and type in joint chiefs of the
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:08.560]  staff expansion proposal, that'll bring it up. But I think this video needs to go viral of
[02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:15.280]  Lindsey Graham, because he's also, when he's doing his jerking like craziness, he talks about,
[02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:22.880]  you know, national like emergencies, disasters, hurricanes, whatever, you know, using the guard
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:29.840]  on the citizens, you know, as a battlefield. I mean, it's just, it's insane. I was so scared.
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:33.920]  I'm sorry. I'm just so worked up. I can't even believe I found it.
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:37.920]  Well, listen, it's like a caller called us a few weeks ago and said, you haven't seen the debates
[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:42.000]  where they admit there's a secret torture provision. And I'm like, well, I know there's
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:47.760]  bestiality in the NDAA. I know it's the endopausic commentators, a global declaration of war. But
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:52.560]  no, I didn't know they actually admit torture. And then we went and found the clips they mentioned.
[02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:57.200]  And sure enough, it's four senators going, we're going to torture Americans. And we want you to
[02:26:57.200 --> 02:27:02.640]  be afraid. I mean, that's the definition of terrorism. And they were all getting real wild-eyed.
[02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:07.920]  Lieberman looks drunk and is licking his lips, getting off on it. And they're like cartoon bad
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:13.440]  guys. And Graham is hopping around on the stage. McCain is hopping around.
[02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:22.400]  Levin's all hunched over like a snake. Man, this is super creepy. I appreciate your call,
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:28.400]  Janice. I mean, you watch these guys, you know, it's not for quote Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda works for
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:32.560]  them. It's for the American people. John in New York, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:38.720]  Good afternoon. Do you hear me? Yes, sir. Thank you for giving me the privilege of speaking to
[02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:43.680]  you today. I'm a first time caller and a fairly new listener. Now, my commenting question is,
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:49.280]  before I discovered your show and the 9-Eleven Truth Movement, Patrick Buchanan was my favorite
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:55.280]  political commentator. Afterwards, you became number one and he became number two or three.
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:28:00.160]  So my question to you is, did he ever try to contact him and ask him about 9-Eleven Truth?
[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:04.800]  Because he knows about the New World Order. He's written books about it. He endorsed Ron Paul
[02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:13.920]  in his magazine and he reads the Bell Edgams in November 2009. That's it. Well, God bless you.
[02:28:13.920 --> 02:28:20.080]  I appreciate your call, John. Look, I've met Patrick Buchanan a few times. I worked for his
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:26.880]  campaign, you know, at the lowest level, had out yard signs and stuff many, many years ago,
[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:35.520]  I guess in 92 and then 96. So I like Buchanan on a lot of issues, but Buchanan won't commit
[02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:42.960]  political suicide and Ron Paul won't do it either. You know, they've got that clip of Ron Paul being
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:46.720]  asked by the lovely lady, why won't you cover 9-Eleven Truth? And he said, well, I'm busy with other
[02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:57.520]  things. And now they're saying, hey, this staffer says that you said it was the government. I tend
[02:28:57.520 --> 02:29:02.640]  to think that's probably not true. Plus the guy ran against him in his congressional seat and is
[02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:10.720]  probably a mole. I don't know that, but it doesn't matter. Ron Paul only goes with what he can prove
[02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:15.760]  one way or the other. And that's why he hasn't gotten into 9-Eleven Truth. But he does talk
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:19.920]  about false flag terror. He came on my show a few weeks ago and it's been all over the news,
[02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:25.680]  New York Times, you name it, and said, hey, the government staged this deal with the Iranians
[02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:31.040]  to blame them for a plot to kill the Saudi ambassador. And the New York Times and others
[02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:35.360]  came out and said, Ron Paul was insane. Well, we wrote an article showing the New York Times
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:42.080]  saying what Ron Paul had said. I mean, it was all the experts on even mainline wouldn't go along
[02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:47.680]  with this. It was totally fake. So, I mean, Ron Paul gets attacked from talking about stuff that's
[02:29:47.680 --> 02:29:57.040]  admitted. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[02:32:00.400 --> 02:32:04.960]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:04.960 --> 02:32:09.280]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:14.320]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:32:14.320 --> 02:32:19.920]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:25.040]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:32:25.040 --> 02:32:30.640]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather
[02:32:30.640 --> 02:32:34.960]  is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[02:32:34.960 --> 02:32:40.320]  weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[02:32:40.320 --> 02:32:44.720]  peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,

[02:33:15.280 --> 02:33:23.200]  You see, if I have researched something and I know it's the truth, I don't care how destructive it is.
[02:33:23.200 --> 02:33:29.920]  I don't care how much I get attacked, how much I get demonized, I've got to tell the truth.
[02:33:32.640 --> 02:33:38.800]  Lying for me is incredibly hard to do. I mean, sometimes my wife's wearing something
[02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:43.920]  that I don't particularly like and she'll ask me, do you like this? And I'll tell her, no, I don't like it.
[02:33:45.200 --> 02:33:48.480]  And of course, you learn real early on with girlfriends, then you get married that
[02:33:48.480 --> 02:33:51.200]  they ask what you think, but they usually don't really want to know.
[02:33:51.200 --> 02:33:56.240]  So it's like, do you like this? And of course, if they like it and you tell them no, they'll get
[02:33:56.240 --> 02:34:01.600]  irritated. But you know what? If somebody makes me food and they say, did you like it? And I don't,
[02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:08.480]  I'm like, you know, I like that other dish you make better. Like my mom asked me on Christmas,
[02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:12.480]  she says, you like that kind of cabbage? She makes this purple cabbage. It's really good.
[02:34:13.120 --> 02:34:17.040]  I don't know how to describe it. It's really tasty. And I was like, yeah, this is even better than
[02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:22.880]  you usually make it. Sometimes it's a little, you know, you overcook, it gets a little slimy.
[02:34:22.880 --> 02:34:27.200]  She kind of gives me this look. I'm like, well, no, this is, you know, her, she's a great cook.
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:31.520]  I'm like, no, no, no, I was always my favorite before. Now I like the way you did this one even
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:39.120]  better. The thing is, is that I've gotten to the point where I just cannot pull punches with people.
[02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:43.680]  I mean, that's why I'm honest on here about myself too. People say, why did you say that about
[02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:54.880]  yourself? Because I've found it helps my thinking process if I'm just truthful with my, because
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:35:01.440]  when you lie to somebody, it's almost like you lie to yourself. And so
[02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:09.520]  I think the beginning of turning around our society is that we all start being more honest.
[02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:17.440]  And I think we should be honest about lies we've told, even when we don't know, we've
[02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:21.440]  told them at the time. I mean, I'll hear rebroadcasts sometimes or I'll see
[02:35:22.640 --> 02:35:28.640]  videos I've done where there's a fact in it that is completely wrong. It's not very often.
[02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:31.840]  And I think back, like I saw a video the other day from two years ago,
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:39.920]  that somebody brought to my attention and what I said was not true. And I've spent
[02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:46.480]  probably 15 hours the last few weeks in my mind trying to figure out, why did I say that?
[02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:55.120]  Because I can't remember why I said it and it's like a brittle or a conundrum. It's like,
[02:35:55.120 --> 02:35:58.720]  why did I say that? Because I'm not being sarcastic.
[02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:12.560]  And it's not true. But I guess for people that don't have a conscience, they just think
[02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:16.080]  they just think that's fun to lie all day long.
[02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:23.200]  Well, a lot of philosophers said, know thyself. You need to know yourself first,
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:31.840]  then you'll know others. So I've said it. I mean, I am an obnoxious, slovenly person.
[02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:37.920]  But that's only one aspect of who I am.
[02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:46.480]  And I've got to strive to be a better person. Because if you don't strive to be a better
[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:52.240]  person, well, then who are you? You just give in to being corrupt. You just give in to being
[02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:59.440]  stupid. You just give in and have no standard. I mean, if we don't have a Bill of Rights in
[02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:07.120]  Constitution, the sky, or I should say the bottomless pit, is the limit. And of course,
[02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:14.880]  something that's bottomless doesn't have a limit. The scope of depravity. I mean, I have this total
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:20.720]  instinct driving to want to protect little old ladies and children. A lot of people call that
[02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:27.600]  goody two shoes or a softy or pathetic. No, I'm not a softy. I have an instinct to want to have
[02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:33.760]  a good society. I have an instinct to want to help people because I'm normal.
[02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:42.320]  And in this crazy world, I'm abnormal. In this crazy world, Ron Paul is abnormal.
[02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:45.520]  Because he's a constitutionalist for common sense.
[02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:51.440]  What did George Orwell say in a world of universal deceit telling the Truth to Revolutionary Act?
[02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:55.040]  Let's go through five or six more calls and I'll hit the final news here in the first
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:38:00.000]  show of the new year. I think it's been pretty powerful so far. We've gotten a lot of key information
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:03.760]  out. Folks, I don't want you to be scared of this NDAA.
[02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:16.400]  Okay. I want you to, from my perspective, use it to wake people up and say, okay,
[02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:20.160]  here's the end deposit comment on us. We told you that was coming. They say they can arrest you
[02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:24.480]  and disappear into a black hole. And if they say, oh, I heard on the news that wasn't true.
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:29.680]  Oh, here really, let me take you over to infowords.com. And we've got articles here with all these
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:34.640]  links to videos with the senators saying it that it is for citizens and saying they'll kill you
[02:38:34.640 --> 02:38:42.160]  if they want to or torture you and saying that Obama wanted it at it. Because I've never seen
[02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:49.120]  something wake people up like this NDAA. And so when Obama comes out and says, okay,
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:53.840]  it does affect citizens, I'm going to sign it because I don't want to hold up the military
[02:38:53.840 --> 02:39:01.760]  appropriations and pay for the troops. And then it turns out it's on record. The White House
[02:39:01.760 --> 02:39:06.560]  lawyers in Obama told Congress, you do this or we're going to veto it. I mean, that is a level
[02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:15.120]  of deception that is really waking people up. But again, why did they hide it?
[02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:23.040]  Why did they hide it? Why did they first try to claim it wasn't in there so they could pass it?
[02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:26.720]  And then now that it's passed, they're trying to say it isn't in there.
[02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:36.000]  Because the enemy showing itself, the foreign megabanks trying to engage in a coup d'etat,
[02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:42.640]  that's what this is. The caller from Germany last hour was spot on. Hitler was elected in
[02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:49.360]  a power sharing agreement with Kaiser Wilhelm and himself. They had a parliament and he was
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:56.320]  the second biggest party. And then Hitler used stage terror attacks to get power. And right
[02:39:56.320 --> 02:40:00.320]  on time, Kaiser Wilhelm had a stroke and he just signed the power over to Hitler.
[02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:08.480]  Because of the threat of the communist, it was like, go with the fascist or the communist
[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:14.480]  will take over. And the old line elite threatened by revolution being funded by the big same
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:19.440]  megabanks that were funding the fascist. See, they went either way, just like Carol quickly
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:26.320]  wrote at Georgetown. The system wins either way when they fund tyranny, different variants of it.
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:34.560]  Let me read you a few quotes here. This is Bertrand Russell from his book, The Impact of
[02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:41.840]  Science on Society, 1952. Nobel Prize winner, one of the top theoreticians and philosophers of the
[02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:47.680]  eugenics New World Order. If a black death could spread throughout the world once in every generation,
[02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:54.000]  survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full. There would be nothing
[02:40:55.360 --> 02:41:01.280]  in this to offend the conscious or the devout or to restrain the ambition of nationalist.
[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:06.320]  The state of affairs might be somewhat unpleasant, but what if really high-minded people are indifferent
[02:41:06.320 --> 02:41:12.960]  to happiness, especially other peoples? So he's saying, what if we need to be high-minded and
[02:41:12.960 --> 02:41:18.560]  release bio weapons? Bertrand Russell, here's another quote, diet injections and injunctions
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:24.480]  will combine from a very early age to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs
[02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:29.360]  that the authorities considered desirable and any serious criticism of the powers that be will be
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:38.160]  psychologically impossible. Even if all the miserable, all will believe themselves happy
[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:45.600]  because the government will tell them that they are so. War has here too been disappointing
[02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:52.880]  in this respect, but perhaps biological war may be proven effective because before that in the
[02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:57.680]  past, he's talking about reducing population. Bertrand Russell wanted to, and of course,
[02:41:57.680 --> 02:42:01.840]  H.T. Wells originally wrote this about 30 years before they invented A-bombs,
[02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:07.600]  where atomic bombs are dropped on all the cities to reduce population.
[02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:15.280]  The original book was called The Shapes of Things to Come, and the movie that came out in
[02:42:15.280 --> 02:42:22.800]  the 30s was called Things to Come, H.T. Wells. Watch it. They have B-2 bomber, Batwing aircraft
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:29.520]  flying around nuking all the cities to get rid of the people. Hey, guys, will you Google
[02:42:30.160 --> 02:42:33.360]  H.T. Wells The Shape of Things to Come when that was published? I forget.
[02:42:36.160 --> 02:42:40.320]  I know the movie was in the early 30s, but we've got clips of it in the end game.
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:46.000]  I mean, look, they thought this stuff up and look, they run the world. Listen, this was a
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:49.840]  commenter I saw in a Russia Today interview I did where I was covering how the government admits
[02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:56.640]  they're spying on everybody without warrants. And these, because I went to this guy's site,
[02:42:56.640 --> 02:43:00.800]  you know, he was like a little neocon. He thinks war and death, you know, I guess is cool.
[02:43:02.880 --> 02:43:08.000]  He says, it makes sense that the U.S. government spies, but then if I was running the world for
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:14.560]  the best of its actions, I would spy too. Heck, God is always watching. I mean, personally,
[02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:19.280]  it just makes sense. If you want to know what's up with people and making sure or trying to cut
[02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:25.280]  down on crime, duh, you spy or check in on the peeps once in a while. It's not like
[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:30.560]  you'd like them coming to your door with a survey every three months because it's not
[02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:38.560]  like people should have anything to hide, right? The criminals that run the society want to enslave
[02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:42.400]  you. It's not that you have something to hide. Every time we get governments to start spying on
[02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:52.720]  everybody, horrible oppression always follows. The shape of things to come, a work of science
[02:43:52.720 --> 02:43:58.080]  fiction by HD Wells published in 33. Okay, so I guess the movie in that came out right after it.
[02:44:00.640 --> 02:44:08.960]  It speculates on future events from 1933 until the year 2106. The book is dominated by Wells'
[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:17.280]  belief in a world state as a solution to mankind's problems. But I thought there's no world state.
[02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:23.120]  I mean, Ron Paul's crazy. I played the Huntsman interview earlier. The Huntsman ad that has clips
[02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:27.920]  from my film Endgame where Ron Paul says George Bush Sr. called for a new order and they're like
[02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:32.800]  playing Twilight Zone music. I mean, that's all they call for in any of this stuff. And they're
[02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:38.400]  setting it up. The headlines, Goldman Sachs conquers Europe. Now the world, world government,
[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:44.320]  to be run by private banks. I don't want to live under a world government run by private banks.
[02:44:44.320 --> 02:44:49.440]  I'd like to have my own country. Shut up, crazy man. It doesn't exist. This is the level
[02:44:51.120 --> 02:44:55.200]  of hoax we're dealing with. And the good news is they're losing more and more of their power to
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:45:00.800]  hoax people. From the bottom of my heart, I want to speak to the enforcers, the bureaucrats,
[02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:05.840]  the people in the system. You know the new world order, this globalist system,
[02:45:05.840 --> 02:45:12.480]  NAFTA GAT, the open borders, all the taxes, the regulations. Every time you follow what you're told
[02:45:12.480 --> 02:45:18.960]  will fix things, things get worse. And it's only going to get worse because this is a post-industrial
[02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:24.080]  model. That's what the globalists want. That's what their plans are. That's what they push.
[02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:30.800]  That's what's in their international agreements. That's what's under UN law. It is a tiny elite
[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:36.960]  waging war against civilization because they're in a race to shut down civilization for the
[02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:42.880]  general public before we get the life extension technologies. They're threatened by technology.
[02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:48.400]  They're threatened by education. They're threatened by it. So they replace it with facsimiles.
[02:45:49.520 --> 02:45:54.640]  Instead of enlightenment, they give you rote regurgitation. Instead of real private property,
[02:45:54.640 --> 02:46:00.720]  they make you debt slaves with property taxes. Everything is a facsimile or a counterfeit
[02:46:00.720 --> 02:46:06.160]  a dry. It's like you've ever seen fake food. They got like fake bread, fake pudding. Restaurants
[02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:11.840]  have it to show you what their dishes look like. It may look like pumpkin pie. It may look like
[02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:22.960]  cheese enchiladas, but it's not. It's wax. Robert in Texas, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:46:22.960 --> 02:46:31.120]  Alex, great show today. I just want to disagree with the previous caller who said that calling
[02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:36.240]  into radio shows isn't a meaningful form of activism. I think right now, leading up to the
[02:46:36.240 --> 02:46:42.080]  caucuses, we can all get a lot done if we call into local shows in Iowa. That's right. You're
[02:46:42.080 --> 02:46:48.000]  the funk master five guy on YouTube and you personally have called all the big shows reaching
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:53.840]  tens of millions of people on Limbaugh, you name it, plugging info wars.com, plugging Ron Paul.
[02:46:54.560 --> 02:47:00.320]  You as one man have been a wrecking crew and a testament to using talk radio. That's why they've
[02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:05.280]  got so many call screeners and people. It's an act of Congress to get on those shows,
[02:47:05.280 --> 02:47:10.320]  to make sure what you say is within the paradigm. The quickest way to get on is to call in and act
[02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:15.920]  like a dumb liberal. Call in, say you love communism and everything. They'll put you right on to make
[02:47:15.920 --> 02:47:19.280]  you look stupid. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Tell us how you get on these evil shows.
[02:47:21.760 --> 02:47:25.440]  Well, from show to show, it's a little different. You know, one show you'll have to,
[02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:30.320]  you'll have to act like a liberal or another show. You'll have to act like you agree with them. But
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:37.120]  if you have a good enough story, you can get through, but you have to be kind and respectful
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:40.880]  when you get on their shows because if you get on there and act like an idiot or you don't have
[02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:45.360]  your facts straight, they can't say it real fast. You just ask like, why is Ron Paul being
[02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:48.960]  criticized? You know, Huntsman's new ad. It's very interesting. You know, the Twilight Zone one.
[02:47:48.960 --> 02:47:53.840]  Yeah, that kook. Yeah, it's a kook. I mean, but I agree with you. There's no new world order,
[02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:58.720]  even though they're, well, they're all over the news rush announcing a new banking world order
[02:47:58.720 --> 02:48:04.320]  run by mega banks. I mean, George W, George Herbert Walker Bush did call for a world government,
[02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:09.760]  didn't he? And then they hang up on you and laugh at you. But everybody remembers that they did
[02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:16.160]  call for world government. So why can't Ron Paul say we don't want that? Go ahead. Well, as you
[02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:22.400]  know, Alex, all these new cons and even guys on the left are working together now, all together
[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:26.960]  in concert to demonize and they're turning the attack machine on Ron Paul because they're freaking
[02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:31.200]  out because they see that he's first in the polls there. That's all you need to know that he's good
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:36.880]  is that the entire system, all the political prostitutes from every angle, it's always been
[02:48:36.880 --> 02:48:41.920]  about covering all the political bases to make people think they had a choice, but they're all
[02:48:41.920 --> 02:48:48.640]  on the same team. Well, and if you listen to any of those shows, you hear they're being inundated,
[02:48:48.640 --> 02:48:55.040]  overrun by Ron Paul supporters, all intricately making their point. Some of the people on there
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:49:00.240]  are a little ill prepared. I do urge people after you're done listening to Alex after his shows over,
[02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:04.640]  call some of these shows, have your points ready, you know, use the information. Like Alex says,
[02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:09.040]  the information is easy to find out there. It's all over the place. Their sources, their very own
[02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:13.440]  sources have the information. Use that and support them. I mean, we are running out of time. We have
[02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:17.440]  one day until the caucus. We really need to get on these shows. There's shows all through the day,
[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:22.480]  shows that haven't come on yet. Later on, I'm going to be on all day, all night until the caucuses.
[02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:26.720]  Exactly. And again, people say, well, they'll just cheat us with the electronic machines.
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:31.760]  And then that will come out. Again, if you don't force their hand, you don't expose them.
[02:49:31.760 --> 02:49:38.800]  And again, we're winning just by Ron Paul exposing the private Federal Reserve. We're winning.
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:45.440]  Look, they are attacking Ron Paul now because they can't ignore him. Every time he goes on a show,
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:49.440]  if I was him, I'd say, I've already answered all this newsletter stuff. And I've already answered
[02:49:49.440 --> 02:49:52.800]  about how we shouldn't have to pay for people's sexual behavior. You know, they should have to
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:58.560]  pay for it themselves. Just like smokers should have to pay for their own lung cancer. Why when
[02:49:58.560 --> 02:50:04.080]  you have other people on, do you let them talk about their issues and their policies? But with me,
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:09.040]  you don't. There's a reason, same reason the media gives me the least amount of time in the debates
[02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:14.880]  and tried to tell people I couldn't win because you're scared of me. And Ron Paul's doing it more.
[02:50:14.880 --> 02:50:19.920]  I've told him, you know, on air, I've told him off air, he needs to toot his horn and say,
[02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:24.160]  I warned you about all this for 30 years. Now it's happening. You see, Ron Paul,
[02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:29.600]  everything he talked about coming is now happening right as he's catapulted. And let me agree with
[02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:37.280]  you, Robert, he is on fire right now. I mean, the Ron Paul phenomenon. And again, he's just a focal
[02:50:37.280 --> 02:50:43.840]  point of liberty. We're winning. Okay, the tyrants pass a law saying they can arrest us for no reason.
[02:50:43.840 --> 02:50:49.280]  But they're trying to hide that because they know it's illegitimate. That discredits them as
[02:50:49.280 --> 02:50:55.520]  confirming everything we said. I'm glad they passed the NDAA and show us what pigs they are,
[02:50:55.520 --> 02:51:00.400]  what new old order tyrants they are, what little hitlers they are, or call straight ahead, stay

[02:52:06.720 --> 02:52:11.440]  to get the lights back on? If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear,
[02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:15.840]  because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[02:52:15.840 --> 02:52:21.360]  Here's why. Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science,
[02:52:21.360 --> 02:52:26.640]  one of our oldest sponsors. Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power
[02:52:26.640 --> 02:52:32.160]  when you need it most. Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes
[02:52:32.160 --> 02:52:37.200]  and produces electricity from the sun. It's like having an electric power plant running quietly
[02:52:37.200 --> 02:52:41.920]  in your own home. Whether it's ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer
[02:52:41.920 --> 02:52:46.560]  through painful power outages again. When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready
[02:52:46.560 --> 02:52:52.080]  with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science. Go to mysolarbackup.com for more
[02:52:52.080 --> 02:52:57.760]  information. That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:52:57.760 --> 02:53:05.280]  What nutrition are you missing that's leading to the four major diseases?
[02:53:05.280 --> 02:53:10.560]  Cancer, arthritis, heart disease, and Parkinson's. There are at least 80,000 medical studies that
[02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:15.360]  show a lack of the protein glutathione to be linked to cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's,
[02:53:15.360 --> 02:53:21.520]  macular degeneration, lung disease, digestive diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's, ALS,
[02:53:21.520 --> 02:53:26.960]  rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus, in all at least 68 diseases. What is the number one food by which
[02:53:26.960 --> 02:53:31.440]  your body is most empowered to increase its glutathione production? It is undamaged whey
[02:53:31.440 --> 02:53:37.200]  protein from grass-fed cows. Oneworld whey is truly the first undamaged whey protein.
[02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:41.520]  All other whey protein powders are damaged by heat, chemicals, and filtration.
[02:53:41.520 --> 02:53:45.600]  Oneworld whey is the most life-giving whey protein powder ever produced.

[02:54:04.320 --> 02:54:08.160]  I'll tell you one thing. It is a really exciting time to be alive right now.
[02:54:09.760 --> 02:54:14.560]  People that talk about how they're bored, you're bored because you play video games and watch TV
[02:54:14.560 --> 02:54:19.200]  all day, folks. If you're a new listener out there, reality is all around you.
[02:54:20.240 --> 02:54:24.800]  And this is a time to choose which side you're on, liberty or tyranny. It's on.
[02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:33.200]  And I am just so excited to be alive. And you think about all the people that are going along
[02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:38.880]  with this corruption, going along with this new world order, going along with the NDAA and all
[02:54:38.880 --> 02:54:44.880]  the rest of it. Think about how discredited they're going to be in the future. They're going to be
[02:54:44.880 --> 02:54:50.800]  known as the Nazi sympathizers, as the globalist sympathizers. We're going to beat these people.
[02:54:50.800 --> 02:54:56.320]  We should be very excited. Yeah, they're trying to start a new war and they're so threatened by
[02:54:56.320 --> 02:55:00.960]  the public they're passing the NDAA. And I wish Congress would have done the right thing and killed
[02:55:00.960 --> 02:55:08.160]  that. But we're going to make lemonade out of lemons. Okay, this is going to expose you. And
[02:55:08.160 --> 02:55:13.600]  it has. I cannot stress to you. We're going to do five minutes overdrive to finish the calls.
[02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:21.920]  I cannot stress to you enough how big this awakening is, how much people are getting
[02:55:21.920 --> 02:55:29.840]  and apologizing to me. You wait till the next shoes start dropping. We've warned so many people,
[02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:34.560]  Ron Paul has and others, that as the globalists try to implement this stuff,
[02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:41.120]  it is not going to go well for them. And if it does go to armed conflict,
[02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:47.280]  which I pray it doesn't, look what this one guy did. You know, they had hundreds and hundreds of
[02:55:47.280 --> 02:55:52.160]  police and people to deal with him. And they waited a day while he was dead in the ditch.
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:57.200]  They were so scared to go where his car was. I mean, if the new order thinks people like that
[02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:02.480]  are going to be able to go up against the American people, they can crush somebody
[02:56:02.480 --> 02:56:10.480]  like me easy. Okay, I'm committed to this cause. Whatever. I won't enjoy it, but that's just the
[02:56:10.480 --> 02:56:19.760]  way it is. My shields are down. Here I am. Destroy me. But you cannot destroy the spirit of liberty.
[02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:25.760]  No army can stop an idea whose time has come and the idea of liberty. We've tried tyranny.
[02:56:25.760 --> 02:56:31.280]  We've tried big government. We've tried globalism. It stinks. And they're trying to sell us more
[02:56:31.280 --> 02:56:37.920]  globalism as a solution to all of this. Now was the time to get involved. Now was the time to get
[02:56:37.920 --> 02:56:43.280]  prison planet.TV memberships. We've got a 15 day free trial running again. You can go watch X

[02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:02.400]  NDAA. We've got one up there on our YouTube channel right now. Obama signs martial law bill.
[02:57:05.120 --> 02:57:09.760]  You can get all 18 of my films on DVD. I've done three hours. Not even plug videos yet.
[02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:17.120]  You can get all of my films for 9, 9, 95, 18 films. Support us, but more importantly have films to
[02:57:17.120 --> 02:57:22.240]  give friends and family and wake people up. Almost every caller that calls here was woken up by
[02:57:22.240 --> 02:57:31.200]  somebody giving them a film or giving them the website. The ground psychologically, mentally,
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:39.200]  spiritually has never been more fertile for truth than it is now. And Ron Paul is our omnibudsman,
[02:57:39.200 --> 02:57:46.640]  our aging Gandalf out there facing the bull rag right now. And in the process of what he goes
[02:57:46.640 --> 02:57:51.920]  through and the attacks and him exhausting himself on this worthy cause, you can tell he's tired.
[02:57:53.440 --> 02:58:00.320]  I could see it coming in his life force, you know, being spent. He understands on this worthy cause
[02:58:00.320 --> 02:58:07.360]  we affect generations worldwide. They're demonizing Ron Paul because those ideas are universal
[02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.480]  and they are the antidote to the globalist poison.
[02:58:10.480 --> 02:58:16.720]  The system knows it and is scared. We're going to come back from break and go to
[02:58:18.720 --> 02:58:23.440]  Micah, New Jersey first, then Danny, then Kristen. I'll try to get to Robert, but at least get to
[02:58:23.440 --> 02:58:30.320]  those three straight ahead. Main radio transmission ends now with some stations carrying the first
[02:58:30.320 --> 02:58:33.760]  hour again in the fourth hour. And I'm going to come back and take some more of your calls.
[02:58:33.760 --> 02:58:38.000]  Great first show of the new year. We'll be back tonight on the TV with key information.
[02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:48.480]  Seven o'clock person planet on TV. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCN live.com today.
[02:58:53.120 --> 02:58:57.120]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator.
[02:58:57.120 --> 02:59:02.080]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[02:59:02.080 --> 02:59:07.520]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system is the first
[02:59:07.520 --> 02:59:12.560]  line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The silver lungs generator infuses
[02:59:12.560 --> 02:59:18.560]  the respiratory system with your self produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the
[02:59:18.560 --> 02:59:23.920]  silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening
[02:59:23.920 --> 02:59:29.760]  the sale of nano silver products. You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with
[02:59:29.760 --> 02:59:35.200]  the silver lungs generator. Very easy to follow step by step instructions are provided making
[02:59:35.200 --> 02:59:42.320]  production fast and simple. Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[02:59:42.320 --> 03:00:10.320]  technology of the silver lungs generator. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[03:00:13.280 --> 03:00:17.520]  Yeah, happy to know you. How are you doing? Good sir. Welcome. All right. I'm calling about
[03:00:17.520 --> 03:00:23.360]  Mitt Romney. He's withholding his tax information and it seems that he's concealing a $2.5 million
[03:00:23.360 --> 03:00:28.160]  refund and of course this is tied in with everything that happened with the bailouts and
[03:00:28.160 --> 03:00:35.440]  being being tied to AIG and Bear Stearns and you know the whole George Bush and Nancy Pelosi thing.
[03:00:35.440 --> 03:00:38.880]  And you know this is going to turn him down because he's involved with the fraud but the
[03:00:38.880 --> 03:00:48.000]  derivative. That's right. Mitt Romney is a ringer just like John Kerry was for Bush just
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:55.680]  like Bob Dole was for Clinton. He is an absolute ringer and wrote Obamacare loves abortion.
[03:00:56.400 --> 03:01:01.600]  This just shows you how sick mainline Republicans are. I mean they're just as wicked as wicked
[03:01:01.600 --> 03:01:08.800]  Obama supporters. They're just idiots. And also involved in this whole thing is a man. His name
[03:01:08.800 --> 03:01:18.000]  is uh what's his name? See he's uh Bane Capital. He's a former General Electric CEO, Money Launderer
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:26.000]  by the name of Jack Welch. So all these people are in bed together and also um off the air I want
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:30.240]  to give you contact information for Benjamin Fulford because he wants to come on and talk about this
[03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:38.560]  whole thing with the lawsuit that was filed in Manhattan. Okay great. John will you get the
[03:01:38.560 --> 03:01:44.080]  information from Mike for Fulford? Thank you sir. Then just give it to Jaren. I do want to get
[03:01:44.080 --> 03:01:51.120]  Fulford on. Just thank you. Let's talk to Danny in Missouri. You're on the air. Hey Alex. Thank you
[03:01:51.120 --> 03:01:58.720]  for doing everything you guys do over at InfoWars. Are you there? Yes sir. Okay. I'm an army,
[03:01:58.720 --> 03:02:06.320]  ex-army. I'm also a Ron Paul Caucus State surveyor. Good job. Thank you. We're trying our hardest.
[03:02:06.320 --> 03:02:12.000]  A couple things I wanted to go over real quick. Right here in Fort Lost in the woods, Missouri,
[03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:17.680]  that's where they do all the MP training for military. I have a buddy who works for a contractor
[03:02:17.680 --> 03:02:24.400]  that's doing some work on the military base right now. And there is a sign in front of a facility
[03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:30.320]  that is civilian internment work camp training facility and this is where they bring all of the
[03:02:30.320 --> 03:02:36.400]  MPs to train them on how to detain us basically. No, I knew that it was that one big part of the
[03:02:36.400 --> 03:02:41.840]  FEMA takeover is the civilian inmate labor camp program. That was declassified in 97 by Clinton,
[03:02:41.840 --> 03:02:45.680]  but you're saying they've actually got it in front of the camp? Yeah, they have a sign right in front
[03:02:45.680 --> 03:02:49.200]  of the camp and there's guards and there's nobody in there but they're just it's a training facility.
[03:02:49.200 --> 03:02:55.040]  Can you do me a favor? Yeah. Now that we're getting everybody's number, can I get your name
[03:02:55.040 --> 03:03:01.120]  and number off air and give us all the info just so I can show people that? Or could you get over
[03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:05.920]  there and take a photo of it? I'm actually working on that right now. I'm trying to get a picture
[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:11.280]  for you. Okay, what's the name of the what's the name of the fort again? It's Fort Leonard Wood.
[03:03:12.160 --> 03:03:17.440]  Okay, that's a big one. Which entrance is that? Which entrance is that? I'm not sure which entrance
[03:03:17.440 --> 03:03:21.760]  it is, but there is he said there's also a bigger compound that is empty right now that
[03:03:21.760 --> 03:03:27.200]  they're still doing construction on. So I guess that would be an actual camp and then the building
[03:03:27.200 --> 03:03:34.480]  that he's talking about is a training facility. So and then it's basically freaky to me too because
[03:03:34.480 --> 03:03:40.240]  we got we're real small right here in Missouri, especially in this area. Now another thing too
[03:03:40.240 --> 03:03:44.640]  that I wanted to talk about my wife, we're going, the town that I live in is real small in Missouri.
[03:03:44.640 --> 03:03:48.320]  I mean very small less than 2000 people, but at a stoplight there were four
[03:03:48.320 --> 03:03:54.000]  same model cars, different colors that had USG and license plates on them. And when I came back
[03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:59.040]  home because I keep my eyes open, I looked it up and it's actually US Global Nanospace and they
[03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:07.040]  make this map sand thing that is just freaky. But what it is is map sands is a completely
[03:04:07.040 --> 03:04:11.840]  autonomous perimeter security and non-lethal defense system. And if you look at this company,
[03:04:11.840 --> 03:04:16.160]  it is unreal. I don't understand what they would even be doing in this small part of Missouri.
[03:04:17.840 --> 03:04:23.120]  Basically it puts in robot defense perimeter systems. Yeah it's freaky and they also make
[03:04:23.120 --> 03:04:31.680]  ballistic panels for helicopters and Humvees and all kinds of crazy things. A lot of military
[03:04:31.680 --> 03:04:36.880]  traffic in the air and on the highways out this way these days too. Oh yeah well that whole area
[03:04:36.880 --> 03:04:42.480]  is crawling with COG. Wow, well somebody needs to get over there and get photos of that. No the
[03:04:42.480 --> 03:04:47.680]  FEMA camps are real, the NDAA is law, but again they're going to have a roll out of this whole
[03:04:47.680 --> 03:04:51.680]  thing. They're going to have a way that they bring it all out to try to sell it. It's not going to
[03:04:51.680 --> 03:04:57.680]  just be overnight, boom it happens, it's going to be PR packaged. Get us that information,
[03:04:57.680 --> 03:05:08.240]  ShowTipsandInfoWars.com. See you back tonight.
