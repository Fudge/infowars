[00:00.000 --> 00:18.240]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:18.240 --> 00:27.400]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[00:27.400 --> 00:35.680]  back in May of 2021 Austin Texas voted on proposition B which made it illegal
[00:35.680 --> 00:39.880]  for the growing number of homeless flocking to Austin to camp anywhere
[00:39.880 --> 00:46.840]  they please the vote was 57% in favor and 42% against according to the Travis
[00:46.840 --> 00:53.040]  County clerk's office election data
[00:53.040 --> 00:59.000]  no reasonable expectation of privacy in public spaces where their actions
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.840]  content and possessions can be seen or conversations heard again whether the
[01:04.840 --> 01:10.040]  content at issue is physical or virtual examples of such places are public
[01:10.040 --> 01:14.600]  sidewalks venues hosting sporting events and public parks there is no
[01:14.600 --> 01:19.280]  reasonable expectation of privacy in discarded garbage left in the street the
[01:19.280 --> 01:23.560]  homeless had been promised permanent housing from the council which never
[01:23.560 --> 01:28.440]  materialized even after millions were cut from much-needed public safety and
[01:28.440 --> 01:33.200]  diverted towards housing the homeless when the day arrived for proposition B
[01:33.200 --> 01:37.880]  to be enforced the first area targeted was City Hall which had fallen under
[01:37.880 --> 01:42.160]  siege by what appeared to be the homeless but that was an illusion I had been
[01:42.160 --> 01:46.480]  informed by the defunded Austin Police Department that they were well aware
[01:46.480 --> 01:51.280]  that the people now shouting threats and racist diatribes in their faces weren't
[01:51.280 --> 01:55.400]  homeless the majority of them were activists I see the criminal trespass
[01:55.400 --> 01:59.720]  warning for the people right there was a little test we were asking for listen
[01:59.720 --> 02:04.720]  we were being extraordinary asking for voluntary compliance to not block
[02:04.720 --> 02:10.440]  buildings right so we live in so listen this endeavor is separate and distinct
[02:10.440 --> 02:14.280]  from saying hey I'm just doing education that's a courtesy this is never been
[02:14.280 --> 02:19.480]  the reality is that the liberal activist group homes not handcuffs had
[02:19.480 --> 02:24.880]  organized the siege in protest of the will of the Austin voters supporting
[02:24.880 --> 02:30.200]  that protest was the majority of the now absent city council and other wealthy
[02:30.200 --> 02:35.480]  Democrats hell bent on turning Texas blue again manipulating the legitimate
[02:35.480 --> 02:41.320]  vote and will of the Austin voters and per usual the local police would have to
[02:41.320 --> 02:45.720]  endure the task of playing the role of the bad guy while enforcing the
[02:45.720 --> 02:50.280]  people's vote to make matters more undemocratic and totalitarian the
[02:50.280 --> 02:57.200]  organization behind homes not handcuffs is act blue the insidious George Soros
[02:57.200 --> 03:01.960]  tax-exempt political organization an organization where billionaires dump
[03:01.960 --> 03:07.000]  money into pseudo grassroots movements designed to throw a wrench in federal
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.640]  state and local government foolish enough to allow the minions of Soros's
[03:11.640 --> 03:16.800]  lies to fester act blue was once described in a human rights article as
[03:16.800 --> 03:22.600]  quote not driven by the average Democrat as their image may suggest they are
[03:22.600 --> 03:27.640]  rather mouthpieces for the radical agendas of the likes of Soros and labor
[03:27.640 --> 03:34.400]  unions you really need to bring China into the creation of a new
[03:34.400 --> 03:40.680]  Georgia George Soros has been a controversial topic his past is well
[03:40.680 --> 03:45.120]  known and his enemies are many but after the media defended his public image
[03:45.120 --> 03:50.000]  recently he had fallen off the radar which gave Soros and those that would
[03:50.000 --> 03:55.240]  dismantle the United States enough time and cover to reinforce their radical
[03:55.240 --> 04:01.040]  activism infesting major US cities it became accepted common knowledge and
[04:01.040 --> 04:06.200]  although it is completely antithetical to the survival of our republic US
[04:06.200 --> 04:10.800]  politicians have done relatively nothing to stop it and it's been ignored by
[04:10.800 --> 04:16.160]  media as it grew a message to the full surrounding city hall the majority of
[04:16.160 --> 04:22.240]  you aren't even from Austin much less Texas your blatant insult masquerading
[04:22.240 --> 04:27.000]  as a protest has only caused the tax-paying residents of the city of
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.120]  Austin to become increasingly infuriated and your cover has been blown
[04:32.120 --> 04:36.040]  you'll be lucky if we don't find a way to put all of you behind bars for
[04:36.040 --> 04:40.320]  meddling in the results of our local ballots as for the residents of Austin
[04:40.320 --> 04:46.680]  Texas this is no conspiracy theory it is easily verifiable George Soros and his
[04:46.680 --> 04:52.360]  employees have laid siege to your city hall John bound reporting and the
[04:52.360 --> 04:55.920]  reason this is so important is it's the same here and in Europe and around the

[06:21.800 --> 06:28.720]  we're live broadcasting worldwide on this Friday June 18 transmission we're
[06:28.720 --> 06:33.720]  going to be here for the next four hours and then the war room with Owen
[06:33.720 --> 06:38.720]  stroyer takes over right here on the embattled info wars radio slash TV
[06:38.720 --> 06:44.560]  network we also have a constitutional lawyer who represents quite a few of
[06:44.560 --> 06:49.680]  the victims that are being set up by the criminal deep state from the January 6
[06:49.680 --> 06:53.600]  event who were not violent and who were allowed into the Capitol building by the
[06:53.600 --> 06:58.520]  police who are in solitary confinement that lawyer will be joining us coming up
[06:58.520 --> 07:02.960]  at the start of the next hour the max kaiser is going to pop in with an
[07:02.960 --> 07:08.200]  inflation update in the last segment or so of the third hour but I also intend to
[07:08.200 --> 07:14.760]  open the phones up today then tomorrow I will announce by the end of the show is
[07:14.760 --> 07:19.840]  gonna be on the special but we're going to have a raft of guests and witnesses
[07:19.840 --> 07:27.240]  and insiders and whistleblowers on tomorrow and we're gonna be taping the
[07:27.240 --> 07:31.760]  special transmission today and tomorrow so it'll tape to air and it will be
[07:31.760 --> 07:36.880]  airing exposing the true false flag that was January 6 and how out of that they
[07:36.880 --> 07:40.840]  plan to launch this total takeover of society and civilization and have a
[07:40.840 --> 07:46.120]  martial law crackdown the likes of which this country has ever seen in the
[07:46.120 --> 07:50.880]  near future so exposing this as Tucker Carlson and others are doing right now
[07:50.880 --> 07:57.520]  is absolutely essential to all of our freedoms because the globalists want a
[07:57.520 --> 08:01.200]  police state in place to destroy the middle class collapse the economy and
[08:01.200 --> 08:06.160]  consolidate absolute total control they're trying to put that police state
[08:06.160 --> 08:11.000]  system in place and turn the entire anti-terrorism apparatus on the
[08:11.000 --> 08:16.240]  American people and that's being admitted in mainline publications they're
[08:16.240 --> 08:20.640]  saying we want to arrest all political opposition we want to make it illegal to
[08:20.640 --> 08:24.800]  not let us sexualize your children and illegal to not let us teach your children
[08:24.800 --> 08:30.240]  that they're bad because they're white this is just a extremely toxic
[08:30.240 --> 08:37.440]  extremely criminal extremely out of control poisonous cancerous malignant
[08:37.440 --> 08:42.480]  system they're building I mean here's even mainstream news headlines a sea
[08:42.480 --> 08:48.040]  change in counter-terrorism and then you read on it says no longer is it for
[08:48.040 --> 08:56.320]  radical Islam it is for gun owning Bible believing pro-life Christians an open
[08:56.320 --> 09:02.680]  declaration of war against the American people and we heard all this from Biden we
[09:02.680 --> 09:05.260]  heard it from Saki and we heard it from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
[09:05.260 --> 09:08.160]  Staff we heard it from the Secretary of Defense we heard it from the FBI and we
[09:08.160 --> 09:14.320]  heard it from the ADL the Southern Poverty Law Center where they said arrest
[09:14.320 --> 09:20.520]  people that disagree with our views Sasha bear Cohen called for my arrest
[09:20.520 --> 09:27.420]  because I question a lot of big public events I mean when you hear that on the
[09:27.420 --> 09:33.840]  ADL's main stage on their national conference and it's put on C-span they
[09:33.840 --> 09:40.200]  mean business they mean business I played that former deputy assistant FBI
[09:40.200 --> 09:43.840]  director clip a few times last week where he said oh I know this is really
[09:43.840 --> 09:48.080]  making you sick to your stomach this is really scary but we've got to go ahead
[09:48.080 --> 09:52.640]  and take out members of Congress they're the command and control of the
[09:52.640 --> 10:00.560]  terrorism and of the cult think about that those are not just fighting words
[10:00.560 --> 10:04.480]  those are what an authoritarian state does because they're a legitimate and
[10:04.480 --> 10:08.040]  they stole the election and they know they did and they've got a bunch of yes
[10:08.040 --> 10:11.840]  men and women they'll do whatever they're told a bunch of reality winners
[10:11.840 --> 10:18.040]  but instead of being in jail are running the country and they intend to make
[10:18.040 --> 10:21.760]  their move because they know the country's awake the world's waking up
[10:21.760 --> 10:25.800]  there's gonna be a giant landslide for good Republican candidates they know
[10:25.800 --> 10:29.960]  the election fraud they are so scared right now is just mounting the evidence
[10:29.960 --> 10:34.200]  is all documented from those six key states where the polls close and Trump
[10:34.200 --> 10:39.200]  has it had record high victory and then by the end of the night by the next
[10:39.200 --> 10:44.200]  morning suddenly all these magic ballots have been found all of this is
[10:44.200 --> 10:49.280]  coming out and so when you can't maintain control the propaganda you
[10:49.280 --> 10:55.000]  maintain control through domination and through outlawing your opposition and so
[10:55.000 --> 11:00.240]  mainstream media is in free fall no one trusts them no one believes them but a
[11:00.240 --> 11:04.080]  very small handful of echo chamber individuals that are on Twitter and
[11:04.080 --> 11:09.120]  Facebook and YouTube but almost everybody else now sees what's happening so the
[11:09.120 --> 11:13.080]  globalists are going to try to launch terror attacks to frame their political
[11:13.080 --> 11:18.880]  opposition to then be able to intimidate everybody else to say hey if you don't
[11:18.880 --> 11:24.440]  want to be arrested shut up because we'll set you up like Alex Jones or Matt
[11:24.440 --> 11:31.080]  Gates or so many other people they're trying to set up right now and they're
[11:31.080 --> 11:34.000]  going after President Trump who they know is about to start his rallies back
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.080]  like he already has started them and so we're not backing down we're not going
[11:38.080 --> 11:40.240]  away but let me go ahead and make this big announcement here it'll make the
[11:40.240 --> 11:44.560]  left extremely happy but they already know this is all going on the reason
[11:44.560 --> 11:48.040]  the last two weeks Alex Jones is trending number one and number five and
[11:48.040 --> 11:52.960]  number ten and number one in politics on Twitter and other places is the left
[11:52.960 --> 11:57.720]  went and edited videos of my show smell like their secret and they go here's
[11:57.720 --> 12:03.720]  Jones admitting to coordinating the January 6 insurrection as they call
[12:03.720 --> 12:08.520]  it and here he is admitting he did it when of course it was me talking about
[12:08.520 --> 12:12.840]  us helping organize the ellipse and that event and the other peaceful events
[12:12.840 --> 12:16.600]  that happened in the months before that and all the other peaceful events but
[12:16.600 --> 12:20.640]  they put it out there in gaslight people to try to give cover to the Justice
[12:20.640 --> 12:24.920]  Department and one of the conspirators the original Oklahoma City attack
[12:24.920 --> 12:30.480]  garland to indict me and we've confirmed from a lot of individuals that
[12:30.480 --> 12:35.000]  they've been approached by the FBI and told just tell us about Alex Jones and
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.840]  we won't indict you just tell us that Alex Jones you know planned all this
[12:38.840 --> 12:44.960]  well here's the deal I never did that and so whoever says that or whoever
[12:44.960 --> 12:49.920]  claims that is a liar and has done so under duress and no one is going to buy
[12:49.920 --> 12:58.800]  that so instead they will simply try to set me up for something else so if I'm
[12:58.800 --> 13:02.400]  found dead in a hotel room with a heroin needle in my arm I don't go to
[13:02.400 --> 13:06.960]  hookers in hotel rooms and I don't take heroin or any other drugs if they say
[13:06.960 --> 13:11.400]  I committed suicide I didn't do that their favorite thing is to kill your
[13:11.400 --> 13:15.040]  whole family with you so your demon eyes when they announce you killed yourself
[13:15.040 --> 13:18.000]  and your family or your family than yourself I would never do that that's a
[13:18.000 --> 13:22.040]  classic deep state action if that happens they did it if that happens you
[13:22.040 --> 13:26.080]  can bet it was directed by the FBI director and by the Attorney General who
[13:26.080 --> 13:30.880]  are nothing but terrorist that work for the globalist and so we're in that area
[13:30.880 --> 13:34.120]  now here ladies and gentlemen I've told Tucker Carlson they're coming after you
[13:34.120 --> 13:39.400]  and your family and you know you've seen his response he knows what's going on
[13:39.400 --> 13:44.680]  he's fighting hard for this country and I would suggest everybody else does the
[13:44.680 --> 13:49.920]  same when they're done they don't have Frank Figley use here whatever his name
[13:49.920 --> 13:54.880]  is on TV saying we're gonna use counterterrorism operations against
[13:54.880 --> 13:59.320]  Congress for a reason they want to have a hot coup where they decapitate
[13:59.320 --> 14:04.160]  senator Holly senator Cruz senator Paul they already tried to kill repeatedly
[14:04.160 --> 14:07.040]  just like they tried to send their operative in to kill the conservative
[14:07.040 --> 14:12.080]  caucus at that baseball game that were successful shooting only thank God one of
[14:12.080 --> 14:16.480]  the congressmen and that's because that they had security there and so these
[14:16.480 --> 14:22.240]  guys 110% are on TV saying we need to use counterterrorism operations to take
[14:22.240 --> 14:27.440]  out Congress so anytime Republicans are together alone they've got to be very
[14:27.440 --> 14:31.400]  careful everybody's got to increase their security that is a prominent pro
[14:31.400 --> 14:35.120]  America person that's not a traitor because this is a foreign multinational
[14:35.120 --> 14:40.040]  coup this this is a takeover and they're announcing it everywhere to embolden
[14:40.040 --> 14:45.080]  their criminal networks inside the FBI inside the CIA I want to be clear the
[14:45.080 --> 14:50.160]  entire CIA the entire FBI the entire Justice Department is not criminals but
[14:50.160 --> 14:57.160]  at the top it is a very sick evil group of of America hating lawyers who've
[14:57.160 --> 15:00.400]  already sold the country out and who know they're all going to present when
[15:00.400 --> 15:03.360]  their sell out of the country comes out so they were willing to spy on candidate
[15:03.360 --> 15:09.480]  Trump spy on president Trump we told you all that and now they know they're
[15:09.480 --> 15:12.600]  painted into a corner so they're gonna want to stage terror attacks really big
[15:12.600 --> 15:17.880]  ones and then during the smoke screen of that take out the the American
[15:17.880 --> 15:22.200]  leadership which includes of course president Trump who is now you see coming
[15:22.200 --> 15:25.680]  out saying young people don't need the vaccine and he's got questions about the
[15:25.680 --> 15:29.400]  vaccine and Fauci now Trump is doing the right thing moving towards exposing the
[15:29.400 --> 15:32.760]  entire deal and extricating himself from that because he didn't do it on purpose
[15:32.760 --> 15:37.560]  so we forgive him so this is do or die this is absolute either into the
[15:37.560 --> 15:43.480]  Republic or rebirth of the Republic this is an incredible incredible time but
[15:43.480 --> 15:46.960]  that's where we are as a society and somebody's got to stand up to these
[15:46.960 --> 15:49.940]  criminals and call them out these are not government officials these are
[15:49.940 --> 15:55.000]  foreign globalist agents these are traders these are criminals who want to
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.640]  bring the country down and gut it and they're coming for you and your family

[16:06.840 --> 16:11.520]  in person it changes the world the globalists know their agenda is unpopular
[16:11.520 --> 16:15.920]  they know you're angry and now to get around big tech it's more important than

[17:12.760 --> 17:16.720]  the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like
[17:16.720 --> 17:21.520]  me I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but
[17:21.520 --> 17:26.040]  since taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really
[17:26.040 --> 17:32.120]  gorgeous actually people think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your
[17:32.120 --> 17:35.800]  other supplements but I thought you know well maybe that's what I need to do
[17:35.800 --> 17:39.240]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation but when I started
[17:39.240 --> 17:43.840]  taking it me doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period of time I
[17:43.840 --> 17:48.240]  started noticing okay you know this is a ticket this is working this is
[17:48.240 --> 17:53.280]  wonderful you know I don't I don't have to put on derma blend anymore you know
[17:53.280 --> 18:00.640]  so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin the
[18:00.640 --> 18:05.760]  equation is very simple the bag of bags control the media they control the
[18:05.760 --> 18:12.040]  pharma they control academia they control the military industrial complex they
[18:12.040 --> 18:17.160]  control big tech and everywhere that they have been in control in the third
[18:17.160 --> 18:23.200]  world they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization it
[18:23.200 --> 18:27.840]  is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that
[18:27.840 --> 18:31.760]  promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them so
[18:31.760 --> 18:36.640]  because they can't defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted
[18:36.640 --> 18:42.600]  turn it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human
[18:42.600 --> 18:46.720]  freedom and the free market that threatens their monopolies of control
[18:46.720 --> 18:51.440]  that's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them
[18:51.440 --> 18:55.840]  but the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and
[18:55.840 --> 19:03.440]  that video so we double your efforts we're all in this together you're
[19:03.440 --> 19:07.800]  listening to the Alex Jones show
[19:07.800 --> 19:27.800]  God didn't put me in this position at this point to pull any punches in fact I
[19:27.800 --> 19:37.040]  intend to accelerate everything we're doing the next level but I do call on
[19:37.040 --> 19:43.280]  the power of Christ the Holy Spirit to lead God and direct me and I call on you
[19:43.280 --> 19:47.440]  to pray for me and to pray for President Trump and Tucker Carlson and others
[19:47.440 --> 19:52.760]  because Trump's not backing down I'm not backing down Carlson's not backing down
[19:52.760 --> 19:56.480]  and nobody else I know is backing down including those members of Congress and
[19:56.480 --> 20:00.560]  that's why get ready with the Gliosi police that's why they've got these
[20:00.560 --> 20:07.760]  monsters on television very threateningly menacing Congress saying we need to
[20:07.760 --> 20:12.320]  take out Congress see I don't think we should take out Democrats I don't think
[20:12.320 --> 20:17.280]  we should take out Chuck Schumer if I'd have been saying that and I'd have been
[20:17.280 --> 20:23.000]  there on January they should indict me that is a overthrow that isn't a tip
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.400]  to overthrow yeah I think he should be indicted for his crimes a jury should
[20:26.400 --> 20:30.720]  try him not he should be killed but they're in the news saying we're gonna
[20:30.720 --> 20:35.000]  use counterterrorism on the networks of Trump support and those that question
[20:35.000 --> 20:38.040]  elections when that's our right to question those elections and you're the
[20:38.040 --> 20:41.440]  ones that are terrorist and you're the ones that are terrorizing people and
[20:41.440 --> 20:46.680]  somebody's got a call your bluff or if it's not a bluff everybody's gonna see
[20:46.680 --> 20:53.520]  Alex Jones get set up or killed that's just the way the ball bounces and I am
[20:53.520 --> 20:58.000]  completely comfortable with that but one way or the other you're getting called
[20:58.000 --> 21:02.080]  out for what you've done keep pushing it and pushing it and pushing it and
[21:02.080 --> 21:07.760]  somebody's got to stand up against your ass and my main mission is to get other
[21:07.760 --> 21:13.560]  people to stand up in city hall and in police departments and in the state
[21:13.560 --> 21:17.520]  houses and in the churches and in the businesses and in the farms and in the
[21:17.520 --> 21:21.480]  ranches and in the factories and in the mountains and in the valleys and on the
[21:21.480 --> 21:27.560]  ocean and on the lakes and the screams and the rivers of this country because to
[21:27.560 --> 21:32.880]  quote Winston Churchill we will go on to the end whatever the cost may be and we
[21:32.880 --> 21:38.160]  will never surrender because that's a drug better than anything I ever felt in my
[21:38.160 --> 21:42.280]  life being on the side of right and not bound to evil and not bound to a bunch
[21:42.280 --> 21:45.640]  of cowards and a bunch of scum lawyers that have been all the boardrooms
[21:45.640 --> 21:49.560]  hyping themselves up how tough they are and how badass they are and how they're
[21:49.560 --> 21:53.400]  gonna whip those Americans and teach those Midwesterners and teach those
[21:53.400 --> 21:57.440]  Texans and teach those people that are hard-working that they're scum and we're
[21:57.440 --> 22:04.240]  under your thumb no we're not under your thumb you run this country in the
[22:04.240 --> 22:09.100]  ground you sold this nation out and you've let the perverts that run San
[22:09.100 --> 22:12.880]  Francisco take control our schools I'm ashamed we haven't done more to oppose
[22:12.880 --> 22:22.480]  you here's one of their spokespersons just like Phil mud of the CIA on TV saying
[22:22.480 --> 22:27.120]  oh we're gonna kill Trump and we're gonna kill them and you already oh yeah
[22:27.120 --> 22:31.080]  break the ribs Iran Paul and shoot Scalise too bad they didn't shoot more
[22:31.080 --> 22:36.400]  you're the ones want conflict you're the ones want to fight you're the ones that
[22:36.400 --> 22:43.320]  is still the election because you know we're rejecting your swimy asses here's
[22:43.320 --> 22:47.000]  another one of these enemies of America
[22:47.640 --> 22:53.320]  domestically you've got to attack and dismantle the the command to control
[22:53.320 --> 22:56.600]  element of a terrorist group and unfortunately and I know this is
[22:56.600 --> 23:01.720]  painful to hear that may mean people sitting in Congress right now people in
[23:01.720 --> 23:06.160]  and around before my president that's how you do this otherwise recruitment in
[23:06.160 --> 23:12.440]  citing and and cult-like leadership continues to recruit people to violence
[23:12.440 --> 23:16.440]  what cult should we follow the one where we give five-year-olds drag queen
[23:16.440 --> 23:19.560]  storytime or the one where we shoot people up the poisonous vaccines the
[23:19.560 --> 23:25.440]  Bill Gates cult or the open border cult or the shutdown the church's cult or the
[23:25.440 --> 23:29.640]  bankrupt the treasury cult or the sell-off the chai comms cult because you
[23:29.640 --> 23:33.040]  know the cult you're offering ain't too cool man we like the one of you good
[23:33.040 --> 23:36.800]  strong Americans and coming together and being happy and all and you love radical
[23:36.800 --> 23:40.840]  Islam and every other dirty horrible out-of-control thing and you call us a
[23:40.840 --> 23:46.120]  cult because we won't back down to you so we came to peacefully protest an event
[23:46.120 --> 23:50.240]  and you roped in a tiny fraction of a million people to break into capital so
[23:50.240 --> 23:53.680]  you call us all terrorists so you could now say let's go out from members of
[23:53.680 --> 23:59.320]  Congress and I've got a bunch of more videos of other people saying it they're
[23:59.320 --> 24:03.160]  gonna make their move because they've never gotten trouble what always takes
[24:03.160 --> 24:09.080]  over a third-world country what always made Rome in its last 300 years
[24:09.080 --> 24:21.160]  constantly be unstable the petroleum guard the federal police the fall of
[24:21.160 --> 24:28.640]  any republic is when its bureaucracy and its its its armed men at the top
[24:28.640 --> 24:35.520]  in control of their corrupt courts decide to take over that's how you become a
[24:35.520 --> 24:40.040]  North Korea I become a communist China Nazi Germany and we're following the
[24:40.040 --> 24:45.640]  exact steps directly into that with them saying officially out of the FBI just
[24:45.640 --> 24:53.320]  department Merrick Garland that 65 percent of the population half of them
[24:53.320 --> 25:01.440]  above 65 old people are white supremacists so they can be targeted as
[25:01.440 --> 25:07.400]  the enemy out of this is out of some hunchbacked lawyer with a huge criminal
[25:07.400 --> 25:11.600]  history we're all supposed to fall down before him and do whatever he says as the
[25:11.600 --> 25:16.560]  media covers up all the black on white crime exploding with the black killer
[25:16.560 --> 25:20.200]  saying they did it because whites deserve it because whites are killing
[25:20.200 --> 25:24.480]  them and it took across and said who can blame them you start getting every
[25:24.480 --> 25:28.880]  channel in the country saying that a certain groups bad other groups are
[25:28.880 --> 25:34.080]  gonna start killing them you know Hitler did that Attorney General General
[25:34.080 --> 25:40.120]  Garland who's sold out to all these foreign banks and Apple Computer with
[25:40.120 --> 25:44.600]  its slave camps and all the corruption they're involved in and then they want
[25:44.600 --> 25:48.000]  to rearguard action while they loot the country of having black and white kill
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.400]  each other and then you point at the conservative nationalist movement
[25:51.400 --> 25:55.360]  trying to bring America together at President Trump that you deposed in
[25:55.360 --> 26:02.400]  fraud in your electoral coup your fraud coup that he wants division when he did
[26:02.400 --> 26:07.920]  the exact opposite in every poll so you spewed all the poison you could to
[26:07.920 --> 26:14.680]  create division so that's where we are I'm gonna go to break and I'm gonna come
[26:14.680 --> 26:19.800]  back and finish up with this and I've got huge news on the just incredible

[31:00.600 --> 31:21.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:21.600 --> 31:26.240]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show on this live Friday edition. When I get up
[31:26.240 --> 31:29.840]  here and I say hey we told you this here and there and we showed you all this
[31:29.840 --> 31:34.400]  proof a decade ago five years ago it's not to say hey look I'm smart to say
[31:34.400 --> 31:39.360]  listen I know what I'm talking about I'm on the right track and if you go back
[31:39.360 --> 31:45.160]  I don't know how long ago this was now 10, 12, 13 years ago the Mayak report we
[31:45.160 --> 31:51.880]  got a secret government document from the state police in Missouri and it said
[31:51.880 --> 31:56.200]  that anybody that wants out of the UN anybody that's pro-gun anybody that's
[31:56.200 --> 32:02.200]  pro-Ron Paul anybody that's pro-info wars is a terrorist and in the future they
[32:02.200 --> 32:07.360]  need to be arrested and that was the Southern Property Law Center teaching
[32:07.360 --> 32:12.200]  the police that and then folks didn't believe it was real and then California
[32:12.200 --> 32:17.000]  police gave us a similar document and then Texas police gave us another
[32:17.000 --> 32:21.320]  document and then New York police state police gave us another document and it
[32:21.320 --> 32:26.040]  and about six months after I broke it people couldn't believe it the attorney
[32:26.040 --> 32:31.680]  general came out and she said yeah this is actually true and we're not ashamed
[32:31.680 --> 32:44.120]  of this then years later Obama came out in 2012 that Obama in 2010 directed the
[32:44.120 --> 32:48.080]  army in a secret army manual to prepare for gun
[32:48.080 --> 32:52.520]  confiscation how to process citizens by social security number into quote
[32:52.520 --> 33:01.120]  re-education camps and they even use the term re-education camp and remember
[33:01.120 --> 33:04.080]  Glenn Beck was gonna debunk me and all that and then he couldn't debunk me it
[33:04.080 --> 33:08.240]  was real and look I get why in hindsight Glenn Beck couldn't believe that but
[33:08.240 --> 33:12.760]  that's just hard to believe that the documents said re-education camp two
[33:12.760 --> 33:20.040]  years after we got that document the army itself declassified the interment
[33:20.040 --> 33:24.120]  resettlement re-education camp army document anybody wants to just type in
[33:24.120 --> 33:28.840]  army re-education camp document info wars.com you'll go to the page you'll
[33:28.840 --> 33:34.440]  see the army manual the army number and you can go look it up yourself by the
[33:34.440 --> 33:38.680]  way only because they got contacted was later confirmed can I tell you that I
[33:38.680 --> 33:44.200]  was given that by good people inside US Army intelligence that were pissed off
[33:44.200 --> 33:48.920]  about being given a piece of traitorous crap oh that was their duty not just
[33:48.920 --> 33:53.360]  their their their right when you're given a battle plan to take on the American
[33:53.360 --> 33:58.560]  people that's illegal and to make the majority of America an enemy well
[33:58.560 --> 34:05.840]  obviously whoever gave that order is the damn enemy so my default position is to
[34:05.840 --> 34:09.360]  not want to go up against a bunch of murdering crooks at the top of the FBI
[34:09.360 --> 34:13.440]  and the CIA and the rest of it but somebody's got to do this I mean our
[34:13.440 --> 34:19.320]  country is hijacked I cannot not do this and if other people had my attitude we
[34:19.320 --> 34:24.080]  would not be in this bad position we're in so when you turn on the news and you
[34:24.080 --> 34:31.400]  see the former deputy assistant director of the FBI saying with very
[34:31.400 --> 34:36.080]  menacing face we need to attack and take out these are those are quotes
[34:36.080 --> 34:42.200]  members of Congress I mean one thing of a shoe salesman said we do attack and
[34:42.200 --> 34:45.720]  take out members of Congress you'd go hey send the secret service in the
[34:45.720 --> 34:50.240]  federal marshals talk to them make sure they're not serious and warn them they
[34:50.240 --> 34:53.240]  can get serious jail time for that because that's a real threat but you're
[34:53.240 --> 34:58.840]  you're a shoe salesman when you've been over counterterrorism then involved in
[34:58.840 --> 35:05.720]  operations to kill people extra judicially and you say that oh then you
[35:05.720 --> 35:11.480]  go oh that's what you do for a job and you're in power and you say you're
[35:11.480 --> 35:14.200]  coming to kill us
[35:16.680 --> 35:23.720]  well I take that very very serious mister you're darn tooting to quote your
[35:23.720 --> 35:28.800]  FBI director I take that as direct threat to me and my family and I know it's
[35:28.800 --> 35:32.880]  what it's meant to be threatened me threatened my family threatened
[35:32.880 --> 35:38.080]  Congress you dirty little filthy lawyer you piece of crap who the hell do you
[35:38.080 --> 35:45.600]  think you are I know who you think you are you think you rule this country you
[35:45.600 --> 35:52.360]  think everybody's intimidated well I'm not you people are the problem you're
[35:52.360 --> 35:57.360]  the ones destroying the country you're the ones destabilizing everything you're
[35:57.360 --> 36:03.680]  the one screwing the nation over look at Soros with over 800 last time I checked
[36:03.680 --> 36:08.880]  district attorneys it was even more county attorneys sheriffs magistrates
[36:08.880 --> 36:15.480]  mayors it's in the thousands almost every major city run by them I have a
[36:15.480 --> 36:20.200]  super liberal lawyer that works for me in family matters I'm just gonna leave it
[36:20.200 --> 36:25.600]  that but he said Alex I'm scared for my family he said they released in Austin
[36:25.600 --> 36:33.880]  armed robbers that have shot people now with no bail crime is exploding they are
[36:33.880 --> 36:47.120]  literally destroying the country by design so they take away the police they
[36:47.120 --> 36:54.840]  jack up your power prices your streets fall apart but oh racism is an
[36:54.840 --> 37:01.600]  environmental crisis in Chicago the mayor says it's all a distraction for the
[37:01.600 --> 37:04.600]  takeover of the country they're devaluing the currency they're annihilating
[37:04.600 --> 37:09.080]  and all and all I'm saying is to people on the fence in the general public in
[37:09.080 --> 37:15.560]  the government in the FBI in whoever you are this submission to the corporate
[37:15.560 --> 37:20.960]  media and this submission to globalism is suicidal politically it's
[37:20.960 --> 37:26.040]  destructive as hell it's gonna end in total collapse and I know that's the
[37:26.040 --> 37:30.960]  globalist plan but do most of you going along with it have an exit strategy even
[37:30.960 --> 37:35.800]  if you want to see America go down you're gonna go down with it it's
[37:35.800 --> 37:41.640]  megalomania so here's judge Andrew Napolitano this is from ten years ago he
[37:41.640 --> 37:45.720]  had a whole special on it but here's just two minutes of it talking about the
[37:45.720 --> 37:50.800]  FBI and how the majority of plots were actually hatched and run by them and
[37:50.800 --> 37:55.440]  that's the same thing going on with January 6th here it is does the
[37:55.440 --> 37:58.640]  government work for us or do we work for the government can the federal government
[37:58.640 --> 38:03.640]  take credit for saving us from a plot of its own creation tonight has the federal
[38:03.640 --> 38:07.400]  government kept us safe or does it just want us to think that it has kept us
[38:07.400 --> 38:12.840]  safe since the tragedy of 9-11 numerous crazies and low-level copycats have
[38:12.840 --> 38:16.520]  engaged in criminal behavior which they hoped would result in the death the
[38:16.520 --> 38:21.120]  deaths of innocent Americans and somehow advance their cause of jihad if you
[38:21.120 --> 38:25.280]  ask the leadership of the FBI most of whose field agents are tireless
[38:25.280 --> 38:29.480]  dedicated Constitution supporting professionals it will tell you that it
[38:29.480 --> 38:34.200]  the FBI has foiled about 17 plots to kill Americans during the past 10 years
[38:34.200 --> 38:39.000]  what it will not tell you is that there have been 20 foiled plots and of them
[38:39.000 --> 38:43.560]  three were interrupted by members of the public the 17 that were interrupted by
[38:43.560 --> 38:48.640]  the feds were created by the feds we all remember the three that were foiled by
[38:48.640 --> 38:53.040]  diligent Americans the shoe bomber the underwear bomber and the Times Square
[38:53.040 --> 38:57.480]  bomber in all of these cases the crimes charged with those of attempting to kill
[38:57.480 --> 39:01.920]  and conspiring with others to do so in all three of those cases alert
[39:01.920 --> 39:06.480]  Americans on transcontinental flights or in the streets of New York City told
[39:06.480 --> 39:10.640]  authorities of bizarre behavior or actually subdued the threats themselves
[39:10.640 --> 39:15.280]  there was no foiling by the FBI the plotters were thankfully bumbling fools
[39:15.280 --> 39:19.800]  who had poorly planned their criminal behavior and who ended up harming no
[39:19.800 --> 39:24.600]  one all three are serving life terms but the more curious cases are the
[39:24.600 --> 39:29.400]  remaining 17 for which the federal government has taken credit they all
[39:29.400 --> 39:34.440]  have a common and reprehensible thread they were planned plotted controlled and
[39:34.440 --> 39:39.800]  carried out by the federal government itself in all of these 17 cases from the
[39:39.800 --> 39:44.840]  Fort Dick sticks to the Lackawanna 7 to the Portland Parade bomber the feds
[39:44.840 --> 39:49.880]  found young men of Muslim backgrounds loners who were bitter in America they
[39:49.880 --> 39:53.560]  befriended them cajoled them and persuaded them that they could change the
[39:53.560 --> 39:57.920]  world by killing Americans in all these cases agents worked undercover and
[39:57.920 --> 40:03.200]  portrayed themselves to the targets as Arabs of like un-American mind in some
[40:03.200 --> 40:07.320]  cases the federal agents used third parties to act as middlemen the third
[40:07.320 --> 40:11.120]  parties were typically persons who had been convicted of crimes and who in
[40:11.120 --> 40:16.600]  return for leniency in return for leniency twitter doesn't let you have

[40:31.120 --> 40:33.760]  they normally had other charges against him for other crimes that have been
[40:33.760 --> 40:37.840]  dropped in favor of them doing the setup and that's exactly what we know was
[40:37.840 --> 40:41.560]  going on at the Capitol on January 6th where the real command and controllers
[40:41.560 --> 40:46.680]  were actually FBI agents FBI informants and other operatives meanwhile Frank

[45:00.800 --> 45:10.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[45:10.480 --> 45:26.080]  I remember when I lost my mind there was something so pleasant about that place even your emotions have an echo in so much space
[45:26.080 --> 45:31.840]  welcome back the alex jones show the reason I spent a lot of time obviously in
[45:31.840 --> 45:37.760]  the last segment getting into the FBI the Justice Department's announcements that
[45:37.760 --> 45:41.480]  they want to take out members of Congress that we're all terrorist network
[45:41.480 --> 45:45.480]  that's got to be financially shut down to physically set up physically put in
[45:45.480 --> 45:50.120]  prison or killed is because they are globalist criminals that have taken the
[45:50.120 --> 45:54.560]  country over and gotten these agency heads to sign on to it because they were
[45:54.560 --> 45:58.360]  promoted from down low because they were corrupt and now they know that
[45:58.360 --> 46:02.560]  america's woken up and america is beating them and america is legally and
[46:02.560 --> 46:07.520]  lawfully taking back the country and rejecting their race war and rejecting
[46:07.520 --> 46:12.400]  open borders and rejecting it so they're just accelerating the collapse as fast as
[46:12.400 --> 46:18.480]  they can so the nation is a failed state and so we'll be too busy just trying to
[46:18.480 --> 46:22.600]  feed ourselves or get our electrical power back on or to stop a race war then
[46:22.600 --> 46:28.320]  be able to ever remove them from office legally and lawfully not as terrorist as
[46:28.320 --> 46:35.040]  as the left wants to do but through an election through a legal lawful process
[46:35.040 --> 46:38.840]  and the reason going back to the documents we first got about constitutional
[46:38.840 --> 46:47.360]  terrorists in 2009 and 2010 was people couldn't believe that then but they were
[46:47.360 --> 46:50.400]  real documents that later they confirmed they were in the attorney general
[46:50.400 --> 46:56.480]  later did people didn't want to say when she came out admitted at all and so now
[46:56.480 --> 47:01.800]  you see it again but out in the open with it being official u.s. government
[47:01.800 --> 47:08.960]  policy official u.s. government policy a sea change and counter terrorism the
[47:08.960 --> 47:13.920]  lawfare blog the washington post has similar headlines and it goes on to say
[47:13.920 --> 47:19.480]  no longer is it islamic terrorism or the chinese or the russians no the CIA all
[47:19.480 --> 47:25.400]  of it is pointed inward at the people of the nation fake terror plots paid
[47:25.400 --> 47:30.520]  informants the tactics of the FBI entrapment question to the New York
[47:30.520 --> 47:36.800]  Times and the London Guardian where out of a hundred plus cases 100 plus every
[47:36.800 --> 47:43.600]  one of them was a staged event we just showed you some of that famous piece
[47:43.600 --> 47:49.760]  with Andrew de Palatano breaking it down so long ago so when you see Tucker
[47:49.760 --> 47:53.360]  Carlson come out and it's in hundreds of publications attacking him saying he's
[47:53.360 --> 47:58.640]  crazy how dare him say there might have been informants on January 6 there might
[47:58.640 --> 48:03.760]  have been provocateurs they were crawling all over the place I remember
[48:03.760 --> 48:08.240]  trying to go cover military drills where the military had told us they were
[48:08.240 --> 48:13.720]  training for martial law takeover in Florida because the military was
[48:13.720 --> 48:17.880]  concerned about it they contacted us so I just simply went to cover it in
[48:17.880 --> 48:25.280]  Florida and I'd be out there by the airport just legally with a camera and
[48:25.280 --> 48:29.400]  a special ops guy would just jump out and start setting fires saying Alex don't
[48:29.400 --> 48:33.760]  you agree we're gonna burn things down and myself and Mike Hansen had to put
[48:33.760 --> 48:38.360]  the fire out and physically restrain the guy and say I'm going to kick your ass
[48:38.360 --> 48:42.640]  and then the guy ran off into the bushes and was following us around an unmarked
[48:42.640 --> 48:49.440]  car that's what the feds do I had him tried again when I was covering
[48:49.440 --> 48:55.000]  Builderburg in Virginia I guess that was about was it 2008 2009 you know
[48:55.000 --> 48:58.520]  Builderburg that doesn't exist I guess Obama had just been elected with 2009
[48:58.520 --> 49:03.480]  Chantilly Virginia maybe sitting in our hotel at night just you know having a
[49:03.480 --> 49:06.800]  hamburger or whatever drinking a beer guys that come over and sit down right
[49:06.800 --> 49:13.080]  next to us and say we think we need to blow up that Chantilly hotel and I had
[49:13.080 --> 49:15.360]  these reporters would be that were following us that made the film New
[49:15.360 --> 49:19.640]  World Order and after the guys got they said you know those guys are those guys
[49:19.640 --> 49:23.600]  are like FBI those guys are trying to set you up hey my dad's a cop believe me I
[49:23.600 --> 49:30.040]  go you don't think I don't know that and I go by the way they're not cops they're
[49:30.040 --> 49:34.440]  with the Marines I saw him earlier before I snuck back out of the hotel
[49:34.440 --> 49:38.920]  because they were so pissed I was inside the hotel when they actually closed it
[49:38.920 --> 49:44.320]  for about six hours they freaked out so bad as those are Marine Corps officers
[49:44.320 --> 49:51.680]  in plain clothes but and then later they go to an elevator were threatening me
[49:51.680 --> 50:00.080]  and stuff so just this is what this is what goes on but now they just go one
[50:00.080 --> 50:04.040]  extension further let's go ahead with the woke military and the woke police
[50:04.040 --> 50:08.400]  that are left stage big events so they can purge the military purge the police
[50:08.400 --> 50:13.040]  and start the mass arrest that'll trigger a civil war which will bring the
[50:13.040 --> 50:17.000]  country into martial law permanently and then we are going to be in an occupied
[50:17.000 --> 50:21.880]  globalist country and that's how they want it that's what they brought in 50
[50:21.880 --> 50:26.720]  million Muslims in the Europe is so they can have a group they control they
[50:26.720 --> 50:29.400]  can destabilize the country whenever they want and now they're going to do it
[50:29.400 --> 50:34.840]  in America along racial lines and they admit they're doing it they admit in
[50:34.840 --> 50:37.920]  the Atlantic Council and they admit in the WikiLeaks documents that they're
[50:37.920 --> 50:42.680]  going to use race and all of this to and so they're announcing 65% of the
[50:42.680 --> 50:47.000]  population is terrorist and that being white is bad and we debate whether that's
[50:47.000 --> 50:57.160]  true or not this is outrageous and must be completely rejected I have zero guilt
[50:57.160 --> 51:02.240]  wanting to go storm the Capitol and foment riots and make us all look like
[51:02.240 --> 51:06.480]  fools and and and not get our 10-day investigation we wanted to election
[51:06.480 --> 51:10.720]  fraud we were there to show our numbers and show we didn't accept the election
[51:10.720 --> 51:14.920]  results because we knew there was fraud and a call for investigation we don't
[51:14.920 --> 51:19.680]  have a motive to do that did I trust it Trump would have somewhat of the
[51:19.680 --> 51:24.040]  control he called for National Guard they didn't get them the mayor said no
[51:24.040 --> 51:30.080]  the mayor of the leader of DC did I just trust in the system and thought oh
[51:30.080 --> 51:33.240]  well there's no way the police will actually stand down which they did
[51:33.240 --> 51:37.560]  because they sent the majority of them away for traffic control and so am I
[51:37.560 --> 51:45.160]  guilty of walking into an absolute trap absolutely but by the grace of God it
[51:45.160 --> 51:51.200]  fizzled and wasn't one-tenth as bad as the deep-stated planned it to be because
[51:51.200 --> 51:57.360]  you had thousands of people believing they were under Q command but thank God
[51:57.360 --> 52:02.400]  I and others got there and stopped them from going into the building or it would
[52:02.400 --> 52:07.160]  have been many many many many many times worse but I can replay this over and
[52:07.160 --> 52:13.520]  over again in my head I wish it never would have happened but now to have all
[52:13.520 --> 52:21.080]  these people and their lawyers contacting and to have the FBI come visit
[52:21.080 --> 52:24.200]  people that have been guest here and people that have worked here and you
[52:24.200 --> 52:31.400]  name it and say just tell us about Alex Jones and what he's planning and how
[52:31.400 --> 52:35.360]  he's planning violence and what he does with money and anything illegal and
[52:35.360 --> 52:40.560]  we're not gonna put you in jail so does it matter I've done zero wrong doesn't
[52:40.560 --> 52:45.920]  matter I'm a Boy Scout it doesn't matter it's because I'm a Boy Scout that I've
[52:45.920 --> 52:50.600]  got to be made an example of but you know what I respect the viewers and
[52:50.600 --> 52:53.240]  listeners of this show and I think you're the same type of person I am no
[52:53.240 --> 52:56.560]  matter what color you are you got red blood you love God that if you see me
[52:56.560 --> 52:59.440]  set up or destroyed you're not gonna back down because of that you're gonna
[52:59.440 --> 53:04.280]  fight harder than ever to wake people up and to take our country back from this
[53:04.280 --> 53:09.160]  evil so I trust in God but see these evil people to work for the government
[53:09.160 --> 53:14.960]  they project their own cowardice their own follower nature on to us and they
[53:14.960 --> 53:19.480]  think this intimidates us no this makes me work a lot harder have a lot more
[53:19.480 --> 53:23.320]  energy and know that I'm on the right side of history I just pray to God to
[53:23.320 --> 53:26.360]  give me the strength to do a good job because I make mistakes and man I mess
[53:26.360 --> 53:31.640]  up don't we all and that I can touch your heart and that God can touch your
[53:31.640 --> 53:35.840]  heart through my show using me as a vessel to know how important you are
[53:35.840 --> 53:40.800]  and how much God loves you and how love and coming together is the answer I know
[53:40.800 --> 53:43.520]  I get angry as hell that's a good motivator but the other day we need to
[53:43.520 --> 53:46.680]  do this because we love each other and we care about justice we care about our
[53:46.680 --> 53:52.600]  children together now I haven't hit the huge vaccine news it's the worst yet a

[56:53.940 --> 56:56.440]  Here's a man who can show you.
[57:01.660 --> 57:11.260]  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX I've seen this in all s夜
[57:41.260 --> 57:48.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[58:11.260 --> 58:16.260]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide.
[58:16.260 --> 58:22.260]  I'm Alex Jones.
[58:22.260 --> 58:32.260]  John Pierce, founder and CEO of National Constitutional Law Union, represents a lot of the people being set up by this Reichstag 2.0 event.
[58:32.260 --> 58:36.260]  He will be joining us coming up.
[58:36.260 --> 58:45.260]  Hell, who knows? I might need him. I've got some good criminal lawyers, but I have absolutely confirmed now that the FBI is going around to a bunch of people saying,
[58:45.260 --> 58:50.260]  we're going to put you in jail unless you tell us about Alex Jones willing to overthrow the government.
[58:50.260 --> 59:01.260]  When we have Frank Fickliosi and others on TV saying they quote, want to attack members of Congress as terrorists and quote, remove them using the Patriot Act,
[59:01.260 --> 59:09.260]  which I thought wasn't for citizens. So everything they say we're doing, they're doing, it's out of control, that's coming up next segment.
[59:09.260 --> 59:15.260]  But I'm not afraid for myself. I am really concerned for the country, though, because it's like getting the news one day you got cancer.
[59:15.260 --> 59:20.260]  Everybody knows it's coming. That are a heart attack. You know, I'm at peace with it, especially doing the right thing.
[59:20.260 --> 59:23.260]  But to know that they're that criminal, they're that out of control.
[59:23.260 --> 59:29.260]  They've really converted the government from the top corrupt right down to the bottom and America itself has cancer.
[59:29.260 --> 59:33.260]  So we'll talk about that in a few minutes after he leaves us.
[59:33.260 --> 59:39.260]  They have the equivalent of the Chinese CIA director, the highest level defector ever from China.
[59:39.260 --> 59:42.260]  Who's explaining to them exactly what's going on.
[59:42.260 --> 59:46.260]  And he's reportedly handed over to the FBI, which means it goes into a black hole.
[59:46.260 --> 59:55.260]  The complete list of people on the Chinese Communist payroll, like Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and of course, Biden's brothers.
[59:55.260 --> 1:00:02.260]  We'll be talking about all of that coming up. And of course, the defectors talking about how the Chinese knew about the virus because they were busy cooking it up.
[1:00:02.260 --> 1:00:06.260]  In fact, they bought the virus from Obama, who sold it to him.
[1:00:06.260 --> 1:00:12.260]  So now that they're pointing fingers back and forth, the Chinese are actually true. It came from Obama and Chapel Hill.
[1:00:12.260 --> 1:00:18.260]  They just built upon the virus and it's getting a function at Wuhan.
[1:00:18.260 --> 1:00:28.260]  People ask, how did I know all this 16 months ago? This was a major debate in 2015. This was in almost every prestigious genetic engineering and bio weapon journal.
[1:00:28.260 --> 1:00:32.260]  I mean, we covered it at the time. It was in like the Journal of Nature, you name it.
[1:00:32.260 --> 1:00:39.260]  Kind of like John Stuart was on earlier this week and really made Colbert look like a fool because he's like, oh, how dare you say it came from one.
[1:00:39.260 --> 1:00:43.260]  He goes, it's called the Wuhan coronavirus gain a function lab.
[1:00:43.260 --> 1:00:50.260]  I mean, literally that whole bunch of labs, but each lab has its own name for its own grant that a bunch of coronavirus gain a function stuff there.
[1:00:50.260 --> 1:00:54.260]  So just like we know the feds provocateur events, I mean, we know because they've done it over and over again.
[1:00:54.260 --> 1:00:57.260]  It's the same thing. We know the modus operandi.
[1:00:57.260 --> 1:01:05.260]  So that's coming up. Hong Kong pays off three patients who suffered adverse reactions coming back scenes.
[1:01:05.260 --> 1:01:07.260]  China pushes theory that coronavirus originated in the lab.
[1:01:07.260 --> 1:01:16.260]  It says it's from a US bio weapon lab. Well, because it was for healthy British airway pilots die in one week airline says no link to COVID vaccine.
[1:01:16.260 --> 1:01:20.260]  And they have a fact check in Reuters saying, is it true?
[1:01:20.260 --> 1:01:25.260]  They go, well, yeah, they did die. We don't know why, but we're not having high level talks about it.
[1:01:25.260 --> 1:01:27.260]  Okay.
[1:01:27.260 --> 1:01:35.260]  Vaccinated travelers won't be allowed to fly due to blood clot in certain countries like China.
[1:01:35.260 --> 1:01:46.260]  Giant mistakes CDC delays emergency meeting on post vax heart inflammation due to Juneteenth holiday, not even celebrated in Texas.
[1:01:46.260 --> 1:01:53.260]  And I mean, I'm all for let's have Martin Luther King day 2.0 or something, but Rosa Parks Day, but no, it's Juneteenth day.
[1:01:53.260 --> 1:02:04.260]  But you gotta delay emergency hearing about people dying because you know that top Chinese official defective of the US with Wuhan secrets again, we'll be getting more of that coming up later.
[1:02:04.260 --> 1:02:09.260]  Scientists admit lab link theory was dismissed due to fear of racism.
[1:02:09.260 --> 1:02:12.260]  Yes, racism.
[1:02:12.260 --> 1:02:17.260]  Former State Department investigator China already knew the origin of the pandemic. Of course they did.
[1:02:17.260 --> 1:02:28.260]  Why are media trying to cover it up as it goes back to Biden and Obama might drop representative Thomas Massey schools reporter who has to be vaccinated by the cover vaccine explains to him, I've already had it, you idiot.
[1:02:28.260 --> 1:02:38.260]  And you see, folks, if you've had it and take the vaccine, that's when you get the really bad reactions. And that's a fact. But, you know, all these big venues in New York parks and places don't care.
[1:02:38.260 --> 1:02:44.260]  They go, it doesn't matter whether if your doctor says the vaccine might hurt you because you already have anaphylactic issues. Take it.
[1:02:44.260 --> 1:02:46.260]  We're all your doctors now.
[1:02:46.260 --> 1:02:52.260]  Well, finally, Trump's starting to wake up says cover vaccine for young people unnecessary, probably dangerous.
[1:02:52.260 --> 1:02:56.260]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:02:56.260 --> 1:03:06.260]  Three of our best selling products are now back in stock after months and months of not being available because of the COVID lockdowns that destroyed this supply chain.

[1:03:57.260 --> 1:04:04.260]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:04:27.260 --> 1:04:43.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us. We're now into our number two as we broadcast worldwide on this June 18 Friday transmission.
[1:04:43.260 --> 1:04:53.260]  Well, you've seen Tucker Carlson come out and point out that there's clearly FBI informants and others being protected in what happened at the capital event on January 6.
[1:04:53.260 --> 1:05:02.260]  We're being told is the biggest insurrection in US history as bad as Pearl Harbor worse than 9 11 and then building on that.
[1:05:02.260 --> 1:05:12.260]  The system is now saying that they want to use the military, the CIA, the Patriot Act to frustrate the leadership that causes radicalization.
[1:05:12.260 --> 1:05:19.260]  So now if you say things like the election was stolen or Biden's a communist Chinese agent, well, they're saying that's incitement.
[1:05:19.260 --> 1:05:29.260]  And so you can be arrested. You can be grabbed. You can be gone after because of all of that.
[1:05:29.260 --> 1:05:41.260]  Well, he represents more than 10 people that have been arrested. John M Pierce, the trial lawyer founder and managing partner of Pierce brainbridge constitutional civil liberties and business litigation law firm,
[1:05:41.260 --> 1:05:45.260]  a graduate of Harvard Law where he served as the editor of the Harvard Law Review.
[1:05:45.260 --> 1:05:54.260]  Oh, that's something even Obama did to cry to law school. John was an M one a one Abrams tank platoon leader in the US Army in 2017.
[1:05:54.260 --> 1:05:59.260]  He founded Pierce brainbridge, which became one of the fastest growing law firms.
[1:05:59.260 --> 1:06:02.260]  The history of litigation portfolio without over $700 million.
[1:06:02.260 --> 1:06:04.260]  So it goes on through his great pedigree.
[1:06:04.260 --> 1:06:14.260]  All the great things he's done, seeing the trends in government, overreach, big tech, Terry and foreign infiltration beginning to seriously threaten constitutional civil liberties of individuals.
[1:06:14.260 --> 1:06:28.260]  Americans, John has now founded the National Constitutional Law Union to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves in CLU.com in CLU.com National Constitutional Law Union.
[1:06:28.260 --> 1:06:38.260]  And I couldn't think of a better time to have a heavy hitter like this patriot, this veteran on our side, because clearly they're going, they said they want to round up their political opposition.
[1:06:38.260 --> 1:06:41.260]  And so he joins us now. John, thanks for coming on.
[1:06:41.260 --> 1:06:51.260]  Thank you so much for having me on again, Alex. And thank you for everything that you were doing to help these American patriots and to stand up and fight for the Constitution.
[1:06:51.260 --> 1:07:00.260]  I don't mean to put myself Gonzo journalism style front and center here, but probably to talk to you. I need to call some other criminal lawyers that I've had to contact and talk to.
[1:07:00.260 --> 1:07:03.260]  But you've been really in the middle of this. My lawyers haven't been.
[1:07:03.260 --> 1:07:14.260]  So we'll probably say talk to you anyways. I have the FBI circling around talking to former employees, people that I barely even know or hardly ever talked to asking them to its whole spectrum.
[1:07:14.260 --> 1:07:23.260]  You know, tell us about Alex Jones and how he planned it and what he's planning to do in the future or anything illegal. Alex Jones is doing they've got this dragnet out to get me.
[1:07:23.260 --> 1:07:27.260]  And I know a lot of other people as well.
[1:07:27.260 --> 1:07:37.260]  So, so clearly the federal government has gotten, you know, very aggressive on these fronts. And this has been going on, you know, for the last few years.
[1:07:37.260 --> 1:07:48.260]  And as I think, you know, I really started to get involved in the middle of this a few years ago when I started to represent George Papadopoulos, who I ultimately was successful in helping getting pardoned by President Trump.
[1:07:48.260 --> 1:08:00.260]  I represent Carter Page with respect to all the FISA abuse litigation actually represented Tulsi Gabbard against Hillary Clinton. As you know, represented Kyle Rittenhouse those first six months and now have all these Capitol Hill defendants.
[1:08:00.260 --> 1:08:09.260]  There is no question that in the last few years, you know, the law enforcement and intelligence apparatus of this country has gotten very aggressive.
[1:08:09.260 --> 1:08:22.260]  It has accelerated at a very rapid pace since the Biden administration has taken over and our constitutional rights are being shredded, eviscerated day by day and it is happening very fast.
[1:08:22.260 --> 1:08:32.260]  And so that's why I started the NCLU, essentially the answer to the ACLU, which is completely done. I mean, they don't they don't do anything anymore to protect anyone's constitutional rights.
[1:08:32.260 --> 1:08:48.260]  So the NCLU is here to be a centralized organization and place where folks can donate to support the litigants that have these cases where the government is really coming after them very hard and they really don't have anywhere else to turn.
[1:08:48.260 --> 1:09:03.260]  John, I hadn't forgotten the George Papadopoulos thing and that whole setup and how you were on is there's just so much to cover so much has gone on but the illegal spying on Trump, the lying about it, the lying to Congress and now just the escalation and corruption they never got in trouble.
[1:09:03.260 --> 1:09:20.260]  So it looks like they're even more emboldened than other than ever with Frank Figliuzzi of the FBI on TV saying let's use anti terror tactics and take out the networks, including the leaders in Congress will all that is let's take out bin Laden let's take out the leaders.
[1:09:20.260 --> 1:09:26.260]  I mean that this is classic military nomenclature.
[1:09:26.260 --> 1:09:41.260]  This this is very brazen. It is very aggressive. I don't think it's something that folks like you and I well you know you might have seen it coming before I did but you know this is not the country I grew up in and you know I'm actually very sad and you know shocked and
[1:09:41.260 --> 1:09:50.260]  surprised to see how aggressive these things are happening. It doesn't seem like something that should be what happened in the United States but but it is happening.
[1:09:50.260 --> 1:10:08.260]  And we all need to stand up and fight against it. How would you categorize it as a veteran as a lawyer as a smart guy that's been studying this and on the inside of it as an authoritarian takeover as a political purge I mean because this is classical tyranny.
[1:10:08.260 --> 1:10:24.260]  Oh I think look generally speaking and I need to be as you know I need to be careful in talking about the specific cases that I'm involved in as a lawyer with respect to the defendants you know on January 6 but as I have said and as you know I said in connection with
[1:10:24.260 --> 1:10:40.260]  the NCLU. Generally speaking you know I think this is an attempted leftist totalitarian takeover of the United States is very similar to a Maoist revolution. You know the playbook is very standard and well worn throughout history.
[1:10:40.260 --> 1:10:54.260]  They attempt to destroy everything that is old and sacred in society. They attempt to tear down statues. They attempt to break up the nuclear family. They attempt to attack religion. They attempt to destroy history so that they can rewrite on a blank slate whatever they
[1:10:54.260 --> 1:11:10.260]  want and create sort of a cult of the state. They take over the local police. They destabilize the culture. They debase the country. They destroy the borders. They collapse the civilization out of that crisis. Set up a new central government that then carries out a giant purge of its enemies at last decades.
[1:11:10.260 --> 1:11:26.260]  That's precisely right. I think one of the scariest things that you're seeing on this front you know obviously they've been very successful in taking over those institutions that you mentioned you know academia you know the media Wall Street Silicon Valley. I'm very concerned about the way they seem to be
[1:11:26.260 --> 1:11:44.260]  making a very hard go at taking over the military with this wokeness. You know this stuff where you see sort of the constant talk about race and critical race theory and transgender rights and these sort of things that has no place in the United States
[1:11:44.260 --> 1:12:02.260]  military. The United States military is there for one purpose. It's there to fight and win wars to close with and destroy the enemy. When I was in the first cavalry division there was no such thing. We were united. We didn't see skin color. We didn't see any of that stuff. We were just united in a common purpose of preparing to close with
[1:12:02.260 --> 1:12:14.260]  and destroy the enemy and overcome obstacles. So that is very concerning. I really worry for the United States military when we have our next great power conflict and there will be one at some point soon.
[1:12:14.260 --> 1:12:28.260]  Well exactly what they're doing to the military with this malice rainwashing is the perfect way to destroy the unit cohesion to break them down to turn people against each other. They know exactly what they're doing and so does the new secretary of defense.
[1:12:28.260 --> 1:12:40.260]  Oh that's absolutely right. I mean this is this is a plan. You know I mean I think you saw it you know a couple months ago when there was a concerted coordinated attack against the United
[1:12:40.260 --> 1:12:58.260]  States military on American journalist Tucker Carlson who simply you know sort of questioned you know whether they should be focused on maternity uniforms and they were promoting you know Marine female generals at a ceremony instead of their service record. He questioned that. And the next day the entire leadership of the
[1:12:58.260 --> 1:13:12.260]  Department of Defense all of the spokespeople all of the branches they attacked him in a very concerted very direct very vicious way. Now fortunately there was a real blowback from that. Unfortunately folks like Tucker and yourself do not bow to the mob.
[1:13:12.260 --> 1:13:26.260]  And that really you know fell by the wayside. But you know you see these commercials for the CIA where they're celebrating you know diversity and anxiety disorder and all these things. And by the way those in and of themselves are not bad things to be talking
[1:13:26.260 --> 1:13:36.260]  about. But that's not what the CIA is there for. It's not what the United States military is there for. They're there for one purpose. They are not a social experiment. There's not a human right to serve in the military or the CIA.
[1:13:36.260 --> 1:13:47.260]  Those entities need the best and brightest among us who are going to accomplish the mission. And that's it. Well that's right. And we're going to come back and talk about what's happening with January 6 out being used as the narrative as the
[1:13:47.260 --> 1:13:58.260]  legend for this new civil war. They're trying to trigger with all these people that have chips on their shoulders. They're right back. Stay with us.
[1:13:58.260 --> 1:14:15.260]  Your voice counts when you share information be it over the Internet or in person. It changes the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry. And now to get around big tech. It's more important than ever to use every tool we've got.

[1:14:57.260 --> 1:15:17.260]  I started taking high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil more than a decade ago because the scientific literature is overwhelming. It's good for your heart, your brain, your whole body, your well-being. A lot of folks take it before they take tests. People that have arthritis pain they take it. It's well known for the things it does for a body. It makes our lives so much better.
[1:15:17.260 --> 1:15:29.260]  Then I learned about high-grade fish oil and high-grade krill oil. We've got both at infoorstore.com but with the COVID lockdown supply chains have broken down so it's been months and months and months since we've had krill oil back at stock.
[1:15:29.260 --> 1:15:46.260]  Well let's back ladies and gentlemen and despite the fact that it's already very fairly priced for the grade it is, highest quality, we're offering it at 40% off for a limited time at infoorstore.com with free shipping and double pay-through points because I want those of you that have already been customers to have a chance to get more of it

[1:17:08.260 --> 1:17:31.260]  Alright, John Pierce is whether he's a prominent, well-known, respected lawyer or veteran, he's founded NCLU, National Constitutional Law Union after he saw what happened to George Papinopoulos in the attempts to set him up as a Russian agent.
[1:17:31.260 --> 1:17:53.260]  For the time we have left, I wanted to put out the big picture for folks. Now, zooming in on the, really the victims of what happened, we've got these unindicted co-conspirators, the tuckers on to do, I want to talk about that with you sir, but getting back to not the specifics of your clients in their cases, but just in general, what you're witnessing in and around this event.
[1:17:53.260 --> 1:18:11.260]  No charges for all the Antifa people or charges dropped, including burning down police stations, hitting people with clubs and hatchets, throwing Molov cocktails on police. That stuff's all been dropped or has been dropped, but the books being thrown at people that walk through velvet robes.
[1:18:11.260 --> 1:18:13.260]  Can you speak to that?
[1:18:13.260 --> 1:18:28.260]  Yeah, that's very, very concerning from a selective prosecution standpoint. I mean, I think that what you're seeing, and all Americans are seeing this, is that it appears that we have two systems of justice in this country at this point.
[1:18:28.260 --> 1:18:42.260]  It's in direct violation of essentially one of the master principles of the American idea and the American system, which is equal application of the laws, neutral treatment before the laws, regardless of immutable characteristics or political viewpoints.
[1:18:42.260 --> 1:18:59.260]  And so what many Americans are extremely concerned with is you have these very, very serious charges that could carry decades in prison with respect to the folks who showed up at the United States Capitol that day, and then you do not see that same effort, the same degree of resources, the same pre-dawn raids with
[1:18:59.260 --> 1:19:12.260]  those two folks who were burning down Kenosha, Wisconsin and Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington with these autonomous zones. And I would argue that that kind of thing was the true insurrection.
[1:19:12.260 --> 1:19:21.260]  You know, one thing I want to say about this insurrection narrative, and the left is very good, perhaps better than us, at using language to further their political agenda.
[1:19:21.260 --> 1:19:33.260]  You know, it is just false to be describing this as January 6th as some sort of insurrection or sedition. There are no charges against anyone for insurrection or sedition.
[1:19:33.260 --> 1:19:44.260]  Those are crimes. If the federal government believed that the elements of those crimes were satisfied, you can be sure that those crimes would have been charged.
[1:19:44.260 --> 1:19:56.260]  But generally speaking, I also want to say about January 6th in general with respect to the folks who showed up in Washington, D.C., not necessarily the folks who went to the Capitol, but the folks who generally showed up in Washington, D.C.
[1:19:56.260 --> 1:20:10.260]  They were there to legitimately petition their government for a redress of grievances under the First Amendment. They felt that the election in November was stolen from them.
[1:20:10.260 --> 1:20:22.260]  They felt that they were cheated. They felt that no one was doing anything about it. And that includes, mind you, and I think, like me, you have no love law sometimes for the Republican establishment.
[1:20:22.260 --> 1:20:30.260]  I think that a lot of state legislatures, including Republican-controlled state legislatures, dropped the ball, did not do their job.
[1:20:30.260 --> 1:20:43.260]  They should have done it, refused to certify the elections in their states, and that would have not allowed Joe Biden to receive 270 electoral votes, and it would have been kicked to the House under the 12th Amendment.
[1:20:43.260 --> 1:20:50.260]  That would have been the proper constitutional way to handle this to make sure there was some legitimacy in this election.
[1:20:50.260 --> 1:21:00.260]  We're starting to see reports even in Politico that they're going to have to drop a lot of these charges and things because there's just no evidence of what they've even charged them with in many of the cases.
[1:21:00.260 --> 1:21:13.260]  I know you can't get into your clients specifically, but what can you say about that and then the treatment of the solitary confinement and the locking them in the bottom of this jail and people having their eyes beaten out reportedly?
[1:21:13.260 --> 1:21:24.260]  Yeah, so first of all, with respect to evidence, just like you and the rest of the public, myself and defense counsel are waiting to see the evidence.
[1:21:24.260 --> 1:21:39.260]  There is some discovery, some evidence specific to particular cases that is dripping out bit by bit, but in terms of what we really need to see, we need to see those 15,000 hours of video that we're taking at the Capitol.
[1:21:39.260 --> 1:21:44.260]  We need to see every single second of it. We need to see exactly what happened at the Capitol that day.
[1:21:44.260 --> 1:21:51.260]  I can tell you with respect to all of my clients, our defendants, we are taking every single one of those cases to trial.
[1:21:51.260 --> 1:22:00.260]  We intend to seek full acquittals, and I believe that is candidly the only way that we're going to expose the truth of what actually happened on January 6th.
[1:22:00.260 --> 1:22:06.260]  With respect to the treatment of the detainees, we are very concerned.
[1:22:06.260 --> 1:22:17.260]  I have two clients, well, it's growing now, but at least two clients as we speak who are detained, actually three or four, and we are very concerned.
[1:22:17.260 --> 1:22:23.260]  So one of them is Christopher Warrell. He's from Florida. He has non-Hodgkins lymphoma. It's getting worse by the day.
[1:22:23.260 --> 1:22:28.260]  He contracted COVID while he was in jail. He has not been allowed to see his oncologist.
[1:22:28.260 --> 1:22:36.260]  He has not been allowed to receive the cancer treatment that was prescribed to him by his oncologist. That's very concerning.
[1:22:36.260 --> 1:22:44.260]  I now also represent Ryan Samsell. He is the individual that you are referring to who appears to have been, he was severely beaten,
[1:22:44.260 --> 1:22:48.260]  and it appears to have been by a federal corrections officer. He is crippled for life.
[1:22:48.260 --> 1:22:54.260]  He is blind in one eye. He has lost the use of an arm. He is not receiving the medical treatment that he needs.
[1:22:54.260 --> 1:23:00.260]  So that's your client that happened to? That is now my client. That's right.
[1:23:00.260 --> 1:23:11.260]  He needs treatment now. His situation is such that if he doesn't get MRIs, if he doesn't get surgery, he's going to be more and more crippled for life.
[1:23:11.260 --> 1:23:19.260]  I have another client who has 95% kidney failure, who needs dialysis and is not receiving dialysis.
[1:23:19.260 --> 1:23:24.260]  There is a very real possibility that one or more of these individuals could die.
[1:23:24.260 --> 1:23:31.260]  Pre-trial while they are awaiting a trial being detained is very concerning.
[1:23:31.260 --> 1:23:36.260]  And when I heard about the court testimony, I guess it was your client, you were there, but the lawyer put forward the transcript.
[1:23:36.260 --> 1:23:43.260]  I guess that was you, or correct me if I'm wrong, that the guards, predominantly black, actually believe these are white supremacists.
[1:23:43.260 --> 1:23:50.260]  They are beating. So they are believing the narrative of the Attorney General and others that have called them all white supremacists, which white supremacists are to be beaten.
[1:23:50.260 --> 1:23:56.260]  But the point is they are demonizing them, and so that's part of the reason they are being assaulted.
[1:23:56.260 --> 1:24:04.260]  Well, I just took over that case. So whatever you would have seen in terms of the transcript would have been a different lawyer.
[1:24:04.260 --> 1:24:14.260]  You know, I can't speak first hand to, you know, precisely what is occurring inside the facilities. Obviously, you know, I hear things, you know, I don't want to...
[1:24:14.260 --> 1:24:21.260]  I know you got to go and get you back up with other updates every week or so as this unfolds, NCLU.com.
[1:24:21.260 --> 1:24:26.260]  I appreciate you stepping up with other lawyers to do this and helping all these people out.
[1:24:26.260 --> 1:24:31.260]  So God bless you. In a minute and a half, other points you want to impart to the viewers.
[1:24:31.260 --> 1:24:35.260]  The most important thing, Alex, is we need help with the NCLU.
[1:24:35.260 --> 1:24:41.260]  Anything anyone can do, you know, small-dollar donations, big-dollar donations, volunteer, have lawyers reach out.
[1:24:41.260 --> 1:24:46.260]  If folks are clients that need legal help, you know, reach out to us.
[1:24:46.260 --> 1:24:54.260]  You know, this is the ACLU of the future and of right now, except we're actually going to protect everyone's constitutional rights.
[1:24:54.260 --> 1:24:58.260]  And I want to be clear that this is not a Republican organization. This is not a conservative organization.
[1:24:58.260 --> 1:25:04.260]  You know, I myself, of course, am an American first conservative populist, you know, person.
[1:25:04.260 --> 1:25:10.260]  But the reason that we have a constitution that lasts for decades and generations, if we save it this time,
[1:25:10.260 --> 1:25:15.260]  is that we fight for everyone's constitutional rights, and that's what we're going to do.
[1:25:15.260 --> 1:25:20.260]  Finally, you know, I would like to say that I think it's very important in the country right now.
[1:25:20.260 --> 1:25:25.260]  First of all, everyone needs to get off the sidelines and help. It's go time. We're in a fourth turning.
[1:25:25.260 --> 1:25:30.260]  This is a crisis. We need everyone's help. But I think two things that we need to do as a country are, number one,
[1:25:30.260 --> 1:25:34.260]  we have to return to our founding principles. We have to return to limited government,
[1:25:34.260 --> 1:25:40.260]  a federal government of enumerated powers that's very limited with everything reserved to the states under the 10th Amendment.
[1:25:40.260 --> 1:25:48.260]  Finally, we need to return to God. No matter what the Constitution says, if we do not have a virtuous citizenry and a moral people,
[1:25:48.260 --> 1:25:51.260]  you know, we're in real trouble. So that's what I would do.
[1:25:51.260 --> 1:25:56.260]  I totally agree. Thank you so much. God bless you. Have a good weekend.
[1:26:21.260 --> 1:26:29.260]  And get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.

[1:28:04.260 --> 1:28:15.260]  And if you research, even the UN's own admissions, over 2 billion people on planet Earth out of 7.5 billion have cognitive disabilities, lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[1:28:15.260 --> 1:28:19.260]  That's why they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food, isn't in the salt anymore.
[1:28:19.260 --> 1:28:27.260]  Now, regular iodine that you find in food is bound to different minerals, and so it's hard for your body to absorb.

[1:29:39.260 --> 1:29:50.260]  We have a great guest host in the fourth hour ahead of what's going to be unfolding with Owen Shroyer and the War Room coming up.
[1:29:50.260 --> 1:29:57.260]  You'll definitely want to tune into the broadcast this weekend, and on Sunday and on Monday, I'm going to be in New York City.
[1:29:57.260 --> 1:30:02.260]  And we're going to be there on some special missions of justice and freedom.
[1:30:02.260 --> 1:30:06.260]  So that is all coming up as well.
[1:30:06.260 --> 1:30:18.260]  But I want to open the phones up before Max Kaiser joins us in the last 30 minutes of the next hour on the inflationary numbers coming out that are so serious.
[1:30:18.260 --> 1:30:26.260]  And then we also have Stu Peters hosting the fourth hour today.
[1:30:26.260 --> 1:30:36.260]  And then, of course, we also just had John Pearson with the important work that John is doing.
[1:30:36.260 --> 1:30:39.260]  You see all this news I've got in front of me of your TV viewer.
[1:30:39.260 --> 1:30:45.260]  I've got a couple hundred articles here. They're all important. They're all insanely over the top.
[1:30:45.260 --> 1:30:57.260]  But if you don't realize that we have megabanks and megacorporations that have a unified global anti-human agenda and that they have a plan, none of this makes sense.
[1:30:57.260 --> 1:31:14.260]  But when you understand that, you see the agenda to make things bad, to collapse things, to slowly poison people and then have the corrupt medical system absorb the people that they've actually poisoned and then extract all of their wealth out of them while they kill them.
[1:31:14.260 --> 1:31:34.260]  And I've really been heartened by how many tens of thousands of prominent doctors and scientists and nurses and others have gone public and said COVID's a takeover and really been doing a great job exposing the suppression of totally viable treatments and the rest of it.
[1:31:34.260 --> 1:31:56.260]  But it's not enough because the leadership of the New World Order, the Klaus Schwab's, the Bill Gates's and the Prince Charles's of the world, they are not worried about ever being held accountable for the depopulation operation they're carrying out against us.
[1:31:56.260 --> 1:32:15.260]  So at the end of the day, I'm infuriated with Frank Figliozzi, just a dirty, corrupt, evil Democrat lawyer on TV at the FBI saying we're going to wage war against Congress with anti-terrorism tactics because they're radicalizing people.
[1:32:15.260 --> 1:32:28.260]  Oh, we're going to kill this e-mom because he's radicalizing people. I mean, those are declarations of war, but that guy is like dog manure. I don't want to run out in the field and stomp on it and attack it.
[1:32:28.260 --> 1:32:37.260]  I want it to stay away from me. I get that clip pretty again. But I want you to understand that is them externalizing their operation against us.
[1:32:37.260 --> 1:32:52.260]  So they're really going to make this move. They're doing it now and it makes me sick to my stomach. I just want to be happy and live my life and go to the National Parks and go driving on a motorboat and eat enchiladas.
[1:32:52.260 --> 1:33:00.260]  But there's a bunch of creepy, weird dudes that want to run the world and they're not going to stop. I mean, these are sickos, man.
[1:33:00.260 --> 1:33:10.260]  And I mean, I could tell you, I was told this by Ted Gunnerson, who was a good FBI agent. And I was told this by Benton Parton, who was the former head of Air Force Weapons Development.
[1:33:10.260 --> 1:33:21.260]  And I was told this by General Stubblemine, that was the head of all special forces. And I was told this by all these old timers. And I didn't think they were crazy because they were dead on about the history I knew.
[1:33:21.260 --> 1:33:31.260]  But they all told me it was a bunch of devil worship and pedophiles at the top. And it turns out they weren't.
[1:33:31.260 --> 1:33:41.260]  That's who was on the top and General Stubblemine and General Parton and Ted Gunnerson all told me the truth.
[1:33:41.260 --> 1:33:51.260]  In fact, I got chills a couple of years ago when the FBI released because of the statute of limitations and because of the declassification laws.
[1:33:51.260 --> 1:34:01.260]  30-year-old documents from the Finder's case and 40-year-old documents. And I was reading, it was over a thousand pages of it, and I was just scanning through it for a couple of hours.
[1:34:01.260 --> 1:34:14.260]  And I was physically getting nauseous because I was having flashbacks that Ted Gunnerson on my show and other shows and big speeches he gave across the country.
[1:34:14.260 --> 1:34:24.260]  And I was sitting there reading it and this was stuff he told me. And this was the FBI reports and all of it and the confirmation of the CIA child kidnapping.
[1:34:24.260 --> 1:34:34.260]  And just all of it. And look, there are plenty of Ted Gunnerson still on the FBI. There are plenty of General Parton still in the military, but they're not at the top of it.
[1:34:34.260 --> 1:34:41.260]  And so I know it's scary to know we got a bunch of pedophile devil worshipers running stuff, but that's just the way it is.
[1:34:41.260 --> 1:34:51.260]  The Bible told us that happens. And so we just have to say no to these people and we have to stand up against them and speak out against them.
[1:34:51.260 --> 1:34:59.260]  And we've got to be smart, too. We need more rallies around the nation saying we don't buy open borders and globalism and election fraud.
[1:34:59.260 --> 1:35:06.260]  And we've done a great job not being violent in the past. We got set up on January 6th because we got too confident.
[1:35:06.260 --> 1:35:11.260]  But we just really have to get aggressive, just like the lawyer we had on earlier.
[1:35:11.260 --> 1:35:21.260]  We had a big private practice doing very, very well, but decided to do this because he's drawn to it because he's a veteran and he sees what's happening in the country.
[1:35:21.260 --> 1:35:28.260]  And so I'm going to come back and I'm going to hit the latest COVID news and this Chinese defector and just the incredible nature of it.
[1:35:28.260 --> 1:35:34.260]  It all just gets more insane each chapter each day as we go here. And then I'm going to open the phones up.
[1:35:34.260 --> 1:35:42.260]  For first-time callers, any subject you want to discuss, but obviously what do you think of the Declaration of War against the American people by the deep state?
[1:35:42.260 --> 1:35:46.260]  What do you think about all the Wuhan news coming out and the wheels coming off?
[1:35:46.260 --> 1:35:52.260]  What do you make of the horrible job Biden's doing and how he can hardly talk now and how long can this farce go?
[1:35:52.260 --> 1:35:57.260]  And how do we wake the country up and say no to this plan without it becoming violent?
[1:35:57.260 --> 1:36:00.260]  Because we don't want to be violent. We're going to win the midterms.
[1:36:00.260 --> 1:36:05.260]  We're going to take things back peacefully. They're not going to let us do that.
[1:36:05.260 --> 1:36:09.260]  They're going to stage events and blame us for it. They're already prepping everybody.
[1:36:09.260 --> 1:36:15.260]  This is not even 2 plus 2 equals 4. This is a fact. Primaphasia right there.
[1:36:15.260 --> 1:36:23.260]  And so they want a war with us because they think they're going to have a war between the police and the military and the American people.
[1:36:23.260 --> 1:36:27.260]  And then they're going to sit back and then watch us all kill each other.
[1:36:27.260 --> 1:36:30.260]  How do we circumvent that? How do we not go there?
[1:36:30.260 --> 1:36:35.260]  A toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539-877-789.
[1:36:35.260 --> 1:36:43.260]  Alex, 877-789- Alex, 877-789-2539.
[1:36:43.260 --> 1:36:48.260]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[1:36:48.260 --> 1:36:54.260]  I really want to hear from you or respect your views. I want to understand what you are concerned about and just where we go.
[1:36:54.260 --> 1:37:01.260]  Because I just have this burning desire to expose this. This burning desire to expose what's happening and trying to stop it.
[1:37:01.260 --> 1:37:06.260]  That's why I'm going to have a bunch of huge guests that we start taping with today.
[1:37:06.260 --> 1:37:10.260]  Probably going to be a five-hour, basically commercial-free. We'll take a few breaks.
[1:37:10.260 --> 1:37:13.260]  It's not going to be commercials for stations.
[1:37:13.260 --> 1:37:17.260]  They'll also be sent out at 2 p.m. tomorrow.
[1:37:17.260 --> 1:37:24.260]  It will go out, taped to air, like it's live, teleproper-free. And it's going to be Dr. Steve Pacinac.
[1:37:24.260 --> 1:37:28.260]  We'll make his return. We're going to have Robert Barnes.
[1:37:28.260 --> 1:37:34.260]  We're going to have, just like the constitutional lawyer you just heard from, people like that.
[1:37:34.260 --> 1:37:41.260]  We've got a bunch of big guests that we're not going to announce until they're done and it's taped and it's ready.
[1:37:41.260 --> 1:37:51.260]  You heard the big revolver journalist on with the rest of the story. It's going to be four or five hours of that.
[1:37:51.260 --> 1:38:00.260]  That we will have ready to go on air with tomorrow at 2 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[1:38:00.260 --> 1:38:07.260]  So to the crew in there, that's the airtime tomorrow. 2 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[1:38:07.260 --> 1:38:16.260]  And we're going to be putting that report out. I had Nick Fuentes and others on.
[1:38:16.260 --> 1:38:24.260]  Some of the former political prisoners, like Pete Santelli, who's a treasure trove of experience and knowledge.
[1:38:24.260 --> 1:38:27.260]  He's been through it saying we need to get Tucker Carlson to go public.
[1:38:27.260 --> 1:38:29.260]  We need to get everybody to expose what's happening.
[1:38:29.260 --> 1:38:37.260]  We need a big expose to show FBI history and involvement in January 6.
[1:38:37.260 --> 1:38:41.260]  Of course, I knew what was already cooking, what was coming. So that was really a prelude to that.
[1:38:41.260 --> 1:38:45.260]  I'm going to give you a prelude to what's going to break next week.
[1:38:45.260 --> 1:38:49.260]  Tomorrow's news today. That is coming up. We'll be right back to your phone calls.

[1:41:00.260 --> 1:41:03.260]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[1:41:03.260 --> 1:41:06.260]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[1:41:06.260 --> 1:41:08.260]  I care about beating the new world order.
[1:41:08.260 --> 1:41:12.260]  Because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[1:41:12.260 --> 1:41:15.260]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[1:41:15.260 --> 1:41:17.260]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[1:41:17.260 --> 1:41:20.260]  But let's just say this. We're going to see this through the end.
[1:41:20.260 --> 1:41:23.260]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[1:41:23.260 --> 1:41:26.260]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at InfoWarsStore.com.

[1:41:34.260 --> 1:41:38.260]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice
[1:41:38.260 --> 1:41:41.260]  when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[1:41:41.260 --> 1:41:43.260]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[1:41:43.260 --> 1:41:46.260]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[1:41:46.260 --> 1:41:49.260]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.

[1:41:54.260 --> 1:41:57.260]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[1:41:57.260 --> 1:42:00.260]  People pat me on the back all the time and I really, really appreciate it.
[1:42:00.260 --> 1:42:02.260]  But I want you to understand something.
[1:42:02.260 --> 1:42:05.260]  Don't put the horse in front of the cart here.
[1:42:05.260 --> 1:42:09.260]  Don't put the wagon in front of the mules here.
[1:42:09.260 --> 1:42:12.260]  If you weren't supporting us, if you weren't praying for us,
[1:42:12.260 --> 1:42:15.260]  if you weren't spreading the word, we wouldn't be on air anymore
[1:42:15.260 --> 1:42:19.260]  and we wouldn't have a shot at defeating the new world order like we have right now.
[1:42:19.260 --> 1:42:22.260]  So now more than ever, please visit InfoWarsStore.com

[1:42:59.260 --> 1:43:25.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:43:29.260 --> 1:43:36.260]  Rancin' rages at the stars.
[1:43:36.260 --> 1:43:47.260]  God help the beast and me.
[1:43:47.260 --> 1:43:50.260]  Alright, I'm going to start going to your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[1:43:50.260 --> 1:43:58.260]  I want to hit this news from the COVID file.
[1:43:58.260 --> 1:44:02.260]  It's just really painful to see the federal government seized by globalists,
[1:44:02.260 --> 1:44:05.260]  seized by foreign interests that had bought the government off,
[1:44:05.260 --> 1:44:06.260]  bought the country off.
[1:44:06.260 --> 1:44:08.260]  We put a president in to try to stand up for the nation,
[1:44:08.260 --> 1:44:09.260]  try to do the best job he could.
[1:44:09.260 --> 1:44:11.260]  They removed him through fraud,
[1:44:11.260 --> 1:44:13.260]  and now they think they'll just start a civil war
[1:44:13.260 --> 1:44:17.260]  to get control of the rest of the country that won't submit to him.
[1:44:17.260 --> 1:44:23.260]  And to watch these occupiers dismantle the country in front of us
[1:44:23.260 --> 1:44:27.260]  with every level of classical tyranny.
[1:44:27.260 --> 1:44:30.260]  I mean, everything's like cartoon level.
[1:44:30.260 --> 1:44:35.260]  Everything's like exaggerated, flagrant, living color,
[1:44:35.260 --> 1:44:38.260]  way worse than it's ever been anywhere else,
[1:44:38.260 --> 1:44:41.260]  except for the mass arrests and mass killing.
[1:44:41.260 --> 1:44:43.260]  And then now they're announcing they want that,
[1:44:43.260 --> 1:44:46.260]  and Frank Figliozzi and all of them are on TV saying,
[1:44:46.260 --> 1:44:49.260]  our opposition are terrorists, anyone radicalizing anyone,
[1:44:49.260 --> 1:44:53.260]  anyone questioning an election is a terrorist.
[1:44:53.260 --> 1:44:55.260]  We're going to get you, we're going to interdict you,
[1:44:55.260 --> 1:45:00.260]  we're going to take members of Congress out.
[1:45:00.260 --> 1:45:02.260]  And then of course there's a suspicious object,
[1:45:02.260 --> 1:45:08.260]  the CIA headquarters, so they can all freak out and panic.
[1:45:08.260 --> 1:45:12.260]  It's the intelligence agencies taking the country over.
[1:45:12.260 --> 1:45:16.260]  And if we can't get control of them, this nation's a joke.
[1:45:16.260 --> 1:45:20.260]  And by the way, China and Russia know we're a joke.
[1:45:20.260 --> 1:45:22.260]  They can only bully Americans.
[1:45:22.260 --> 1:45:26.260]  They can't stand up to any real foreign powers.
[1:45:26.260 --> 1:45:33.260]  It's banana boat garbage.
[1:45:33.260 --> 1:45:37.260]  That's what it is.
[1:45:37.260 --> 1:45:40.260]  In fact, I mentioned it, but the Figliozzi thing is so big,
[1:45:40.260 --> 1:45:42.260]  I'm just going to play it again because it blew the judge away
[1:45:42.260 --> 1:45:44.260]  when I had Judge Joe Brown here.
[1:45:44.260 --> 1:45:48.260]  We can have it go as well because it's so seismic.
[1:45:48.260 --> 1:45:52.260]  And the whole clip he goes on, just to declare war on America
[1:45:52.260 --> 1:45:55.260]  and that questioning them is radicalization
[1:45:55.260 --> 1:45:59.260]  and the penalty for radicalization is death.
[1:45:59.260 --> 1:46:02.260]  So when you know the nomenclature of the terms used by the military,
[1:46:02.260 --> 1:46:08.260]  and then you have the new national threat response package,
[1:46:08.260 --> 1:46:10.260]  you have the statements by the CIA and FBI
[1:46:10.260 --> 1:46:13.260]  that indeed their new mission is fighting us.
[1:46:13.260 --> 1:46:16.260]  We pay their paycheck, they open our borders,
[1:46:16.260 --> 1:46:19.260]  they smuggle children, they devalue the currency,
[1:46:19.260 --> 1:46:23.260]  they protect the pedophile rings, they do all this,
[1:46:23.260 --> 1:46:27.260]  and then we're the enemy because we don't love it.
[1:46:27.260 --> 1:46:29.260]  We don't love what the sellout lawyers did
[1:46:29.260 --> 1:46:36.260]  to this weird consortium of criminals that run the country.
[1:46:36.260 --> 1:46:39.260]  White supremacy, most lethal threat to America, Biden says,
[1:46:39.260 --> 1:46:42.260]  and you've got the Secretary of Defense
[1:46:42.260 --> 1:46:45.260]  tweeting out the Communist Black Power symbol.
[1:46:45.260 --> 1:46:47.260]  Imagine if a white guy put a white power symbol out.
[1:46:47.260 --> 1:46:48.260]  What does that mean?
[1:46:48.260 --> 1:46:50.260]  It's supposed to be a red, white, and blue fist.
[1:46:50.260 --> 1:46:55.260]  But no, it's the Communist fist on the Secretary of Defense's site
[1:46:55.260 --> 1:46:58.260]  because that's what it's all about, is division and tribalism
[1:46:58.260 --> 1:46:59.260]  and the breakup of the country,
[1:46:59.260 --> 1:47:01.260]  and that's why he was put in position of power
[1:47:01.260 --> 1:47:04.260]  because he, in general, honor a said they would do that
[1:47:04.260 --> 1:47:08.260]  and would wage war against America.
[1:47:08.260 --> 1:47:10.260]  It's just crazy.
[1:47:10.260 --> 1:47:13.260]  It's like Biden looks like a crazy dictator in his sunglasses.
[1:47:13.260 --> 1:47:15.260]  It looks like Gaddafi.
[1:47:15.260 --> 1:47:17.260]  That's the same thing with the new Secretary of Defense.
[1:47:17.260 --> 1:47:20.260]  I mean, he looks like a crazy dictator.
[1:47:20.260 --> 1:47:22.260]  Not because he's black, he just has that look.
[1:47:22.260 --> 1:47:24.260]  Like Biden has the look of a thug.
[1:47:24.260 --> 1:47:26.260]  But then the actions are what matters.
[1:47:26.260 --> 1:47:29.260]  Here's that clip again.
[1:47:29.260 --> 1:47:31.260]  In order to really tackle terrorism,
[1:47:31.260 --> 1:47:32.260]  and this time domestically,
[1:47:32.260 --> 1:47:35.260]  you've got to attack and dismantle
[1:47:35.260 --> 1:47:38.260]  the command and control element of a terrorist group.
[1:47:38.260 --> 1:47:41.260]  And unfortunately, and I know this is painful to hear,
[1:47:41.260 --> 1:47:45.260]  that may mean people sitting in Congress right now,
[1:47:45.260 --> 1:47:47.260]  people in and around the former president.
[1:47:47.260 --> 1:47:49.260]  That's how you do this.
[1:47:49.260 --> 1:47:51.260]  Otherwise, recruitment, inciting,
[1:47:51.260 --> 1:47:59.260]  and cult-like leadership continues to recruit people to violence.
[1:47:59.260 --> 1:48:01.260]  And I guess I could play a two-minute compilation
[1:48:01.260 --> 1:48:05.260]  of Saki and Biden and all of them saying the same thing.
[1:48:05.260 --> 1:48:12.260]  You already know what's happening.
[1:48:12.260 --> 1:48:14.260]  Oh, yeah, it's not just a black power fist.
[1:48:14.260 --> 1:48:18.260]  It's an Africa fist.
[1:48:18.260 --> 1:48:21.260]  When the globalists are massively engaged
[1:48:21.260 --> 1:48:23.260]  in all sorts of enslavement in Africa right now,
[1:48:23.260 --> 1:48:26.260]  not a word out of him about Apple and slave factories in China.
[1:48:26.260 --> 1:48:29.260]  No.
[1:48:29.260 --> 1:48:31.260]  It's like, hey, we're criminals,
[1:48:31.260 --> 1:48:33.260]  we're the government, and we love black people,
[1:48:33.260 --> 1:48:35.260]  so we can do whatever we want.
[1:48:35.260 --> 1:48:38.260]  Has nothing to do with reality.
[1:48:38.260 --> 1:48:42.260]  You know what, I'm going to hit the COVID news with Max Kaiser,
[1:48:42.260 --> 1:48:46.260]  and I'll tie that into the other big news.
[1:48:46.260 --> 1:48:48.260]  And then I'll also hit a lot of this news.
[1:48:48.260 --> 1:48:50.260]  It's breaking tomorrow during this four, five-hour special.
[1:48:50.260 --> 1:48:51.260]  I'm on the tape.
[1:48:51.260 --> 1:48:53.260]  It's going to air at 2 p.m. Central.
[1:48:53.260 --> 1:48:58.260]  But right now, just briefly, it ends on Monday morning.
[1:48:58.260 --> 1:49:02.260]  It is the vitamin C with the zinc and the rose hips
[1:49:02.260 --> 1:49:04.260]  that you cannot do better for your immune system and your body.
[1:49:04.260 --> 1:49:07.260]  It's 1100% of the vitamin C you need.
[1:49:07.260 --> 1:49:09.260]  It's almost 200% of the zinc you need,
[1:49:09.260 --> 1:49:11.260]  and the rose hips are amazing as well.
[1:49:11.260 --> 1:49:13.260]  It's all in there.
[1:49:13.260 --> 1:49:16.260]  It's the Linus Pauling recipe that you won the Nobel Prize for, basically.
[1:49:16.260 --> 1:49:18.260]  And it's at a very low price for what you're getting.
[1:49:18.260 --> 1:49:20.260]  You also have the Whole Food vitamin,
[1:49:20.260 --> 1:49:22.260]  and it's from Whole Foods Multivitamin,
[1:49:22.260 --> 1:49:24.260]  and you have the vitamin D3 with calcium.
[1:49:24.260 --> 1:49:26.260]  It's good for adults and children.
[1:49:26.260 --> 1:49:27.260]  That's all 40% off.
[1:49:27.260 --> 1:49:28.260]  Free shipping.
[1:49:28.260 --> 1:49:29.260]  Double Patriot points.
[1:49:29.260 --> 1:49:30.260]  That ends Monday.
[1:49:30.260 --> 1:49:32.260]  We've got the X3 back in stock.
[1:49:32.260 --> 1:49:33.260]  Pry iodine.
[1:49:33.260 --> 1:49:36.260]  60% off because I want you to experience what it does
[1:49:36.260 --> 1:49:39.260]  for your libido, your stamina, your energy, your cells,
[1:49:39.260 --> 1:49:40.260]  your immune system.
[1:49:40.260 --> 1:49:41.260]  It's essential.
[1:49:41.260 --> 1:49:44.260]  Pry iodine, infowarstore.com, X3.
[1:49:44.260 --> 1:49:47.260]  And then we have the very close of selling out
[1:49:47.260 --> 1:49:48.260]  of the current prices.
[1:49:48.260 --> 1:49:50.260]  Ultimate Creole oil.
[1:49:50.260 --> 1:49:51.260]  So good for your body.
[1:49:51.260 --> 1:49:52.260]  40% off.
[1:49:52.260 --> 1:49:55.260]  And then in biodieselinium, 50% off.
[1:49:55.260 --> 1:49:56.260]  Okay.
[1:49:56.260 --> 1:49:59.260]  We're going to be talking to Aaron, Charles, Kevin,
[1:49:59.260 --> 1:50:01.260]  Keith, Matthew, Steve.
[1:50:01.260 --> 1:50:03.260]  I hope we tried to call back any of the folks that were still
[1:50:03.260 --> 1:50:04.260]  on Whole Yesterday.
[1:50:04.260 --> 1:50:07.260]  Simon, Dishwan, and others.
[1:50:07.260 --> 1:50:10.260]  Who's been holding longest here?
[1:50:10.260 --> 1:50:13.260]  That would be Matthew in Florida,
[1:50:13.260 --> 1:50:16.260]  avoiding the deep state false flags,
[1:50:16.260 --> 1:50:17.260]  exposing their traps.
[1:50:17.260 --> 1:50:19.260]  How do we do that, Matthew?
[1:50:19.260 --> 1:50:20.260]  Hey, Alex.
[1:50:20.260 --> 1:50:23.260]  This is Mr. Putt, not Matthew in Florida.
[1:50:23.260 --> 1:50:26.260]  I had to lie to the DEA to get on.
[1:50:26.260 --> 1:50:28.260]  I just want to start out with that.
[1:50:28.260 --> 1:50:31.260]  Let me just stop you right there.
[1:50:31.260 --> 1:50:34.260]  We don't screen the phone calls other than you having a clean
[1:50:34.260 --> 1:50:36.260]  phone line and having your point you want to make.
[1:50:36.260 --> 1:50:40.260]  So why would you have to lie and say your name is Matthew
[1:50:40.260 --> 1:50:42.260]  instead of what?
[1:50:42.260 --> 1:50:44.260]  Mr. Putt.
[1:50:44.260 --> 1:50:45.260]  This is Mr. Putt.
[1:50:45.260 --> 1:50:46.260]  Okay, Mr. Putt.
[1:50:46.260 --> 1:50:48.260]  Go ahead and make your point, but I'm not going to indulge
[1:50:48.260 --> 1:50:49.260]  in this very long.
[1:50:49.260 --> 1:50:50.260]  Go ahead.
[1:50:50.260 --> 1:50:51.260]  Okay.
[1:50:51.260 --> 1:50:54.260]  Anyway, I just wanted to start out with a quick plug
[1:50:54.260 --> 1:50:58.260]  and say that Infowars Store has t-shirts
[1:50:58.260 --> 1:51:03.260]  and that they sell for a price and can be bought online.
[1:51:03.260 --> 1:51:08.260]  And I wanted to say that really everything just fell apart
[1:51:08.260 --> 1:51:13.260]  for you and this because you're missing one thing
[1:51:13.260 --> 1:51:16.260]  and that thing is a foil.
[1:51:16.260 --> 1:51:20.260]  But your foil needs to be real.
[1:51:20.260 --> 1:51:23.260]  Somebody that you can face.
[1:51:23.260 --> 1:51:26.260]  This sounds like a bunch of riddle stuff, man.
[1:51:26.260 --> 1:51:27.260]  I'm not the riddler.
[1:51:27.260 --> 1:51:28.260]  I appreciate your call.
[1:51:28.260 --> 1:51:29.260]  Look, here's the deal.
[1:51:29.260 --> 1:51:31.260]  We don't screen your calls other than you got a clean phone
[1:51:31.260 --> 1:51:32.260]  line.
[1:51:32.260 --> 1:51:33.260]  You got something to say.
[1:51:33.260 --> 1:51:34.260]  I'm not going to put liberals.
[1:51:34.260 --> 1:51:37.260]  They want to play weird games and like act like they're smarter
[1:51:37.260 --> 1:51:38.260]  than everybody.
[1:51:38.260 --> 1:51:40.260]  If I don't understand what you're saying, I'm going to hang up on
[1:51:40.260 --> 1:51:41.260]  you.
[1:51:41.260 --> 1:51:43.260]  Okay, because I mean, it's not like a bunch of gibberish to
[1:51:43.260 --> 1:51:44.260]  me.
[1:51:44.260 --> 1:51:46.260]  Okay, who's up next here?
[1:51:46.260 --> 1:51:49.260]  Let's go ahead and talk to Charles in Maryland.
[1:51:49.260 --> 1:51:52.260]  Charles, welcome.
[1:51:52.260 --> 1:51:53.260]  Yeah.
[1:51:53.260 --> 1:51:54.260]  Hi, Alex.
[1:51:54.260 --> 1:51:58.260]  I'm so grateful to have you and everybody at info wars on the
[1:51:58.260 --> 1:51:59.260]  air.
[1:51:59.260 --> 1:52:02.260]  I'm just so thankful that you and people like talk Carlson out
[1:52:02.260 --> 1:52:04.260]  there fighting, fighting for it.
[1:52:04.260 --> 1:52:06.260]  Thank you, sir.
[1:52:06.260 --> 1:52:11.260]  I just took some survival shield X to and drag some busy
[1:52:11.260 --> 1:52:14.260]  magnesium, magnesium and I'm feeling great.
[1:52:14.260 --> 1:52:20.260]  And my info wars saved the frog shirt game in the mail two
[1:52:20.260 --> 1:52:21.260]  days ago.
[1:52:21.260 --> 1:52:22.260]  I salute you with me on the air, sir.
[1:52:22.260 --> 1:52:25.260]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[1:52:25.260 --> 1:52:27.260]  What is your take on January six?
[1:52:27.260 --> 1:52:31.260]  I see you say that you want to talk about that.
[1:52:31.260 --> 1:52:33.260]  Yeah, yeah, there's I do.
[1:52:33.260 --> 1:52:36.260]  There's so many disturbing things in the world right now and I
[1:52:36.260 --> 1:52:38.260]  can't get away from it at all.
[1:52:38.260 --> 1:52:42.260]  But I would have to say that the number one thing that bothers
[1:52:42.260 --> 1:52:46.260]  me more than anything right now is those people sitting in jail
[1:52:46.260 --> 1:52:51.260]  right now from the fake insurrection on January 6.
[1:52:51.260 --> 1:52:55.260]  It really, really bothers me and we don't have politicians doing
[1:52:55.260 --> 1:52:59.260]  nearly enough to get them to get them out and have due
[1:52:59.260 --> 1:53:00.260]  process.
[1:53:00.260 --> 1:53:03.260]  Well, that's because DC is its own nightmare judges, its own
[1:53:03.260 --> 1:53:04.260]  nightmare system.
[1:53:04.260 --> 1:53:05.260]  And DC is not America.
[1:53:05.260 --> 1:53:07.260]  DC is basically North Korea.
[1:53:07.260 --> 1:53:09.260]  It's a it's a G.G.
[1:53:09.260 --> 1:53:10.260]  Pings co-hold.
[1:53:10.260 --> 1:53:12.260]  Oh, yeah, I totally agree.
[1:53:12.260 --> 1:53:15.260]  I mean, it's probably even worse than North Korea.
[1:53:15.260 --> 1:53:19.260]  In many ways, you know, like the hub of the whole globalist
[1:53:19.260 --> 1:53:20.260]  operation.
[1:53:20.260 --> 1:53:26.260]  But, you know, the fact that they're sitting in jail with
[1:53:26.260 --> 1:53:29.260]  no due process is just unacceptable.
[1:53:29.260 --> 1:53:30.260]  Stay there.
[1:53:30.260 --> 1:53:31.260]  I'm back in two minutes, Charles.
[1:53:31.260 --> 1:53:33.260]  I'm going to go right back to you and I'm going to go to Al
[1:53:33.260 --> 1:53:36.260]  Killer and everybody else that is patiently holding on this
[1:53:36.260 --> 1:53:39.260]  Friday live transmission.
[1:53:39.260 --> 1:53:41.260]  Again, if you disagree with me, just get to it.
[1:53:41.260 --> 1:53:45.260]  I'm not censoring.
[1:53:45.260 --> 1:53:48.260]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[1:53:48.260 --> 1:53:51.260]  And so as bad as things are with the globalist attack on
[1:53:51.260 --> 1:53:54.260]  humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding, I
[1:53:54.260 --> 1:53:57.260]  want you to know a lot of positive things are happening
[1:53:57.260 --> 1:53:58.260]  as well.
[1:53:58.260 --> 1:54:01.260]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things that the
[1:54:01.260 --> 1:54:02.260]  Republic doesn't get to see.
[1:54:02.260 --> 1:54:05.260]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of
[1:54:05.260 --> 1:54:09.260]  Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media
[1:54:09.260 --> 1:54:13.260]  or industry, people are really, really away from the
[1:54:13.260 --> 1:54:14.260]  establishment.
[1:54:14.260 --> 1:54:17.260]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're
[1:54:17.260 --> 1:54:18.260]  scared.
[1:54:18.260 --> 1:54:19.260]  They're looking for leadership.
[1:54:19.260 --> 1:54:21.260]  Well, that's where m4 comes in.
[1:54:21.260 --> 1:54:22.260]  You fund us.
[1:54:22.260 --> 1:54:23.260]  You support m4s4.com.
[1:54:23.260 --> 1:54:25.260]  You get rate policy at the same time.
[1:54:25.260 --> 1:54:28.260]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is
[1:54:28.260 --> 1:54:31.260]  unpopular, what the globalists will target you for to show
[1:54:31.260 --> 1:54:34.260]  people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the
[1:54:34.260 --> 1:54:35.260]  heat.
[1:54:35.260 --> 1:54:36.260]  That's our job.
[1:54:36.260 --> 1:54:40.260]  So please keep us on air so we can hit the bar wire, so we
[1:54:40.260 --> 1:54:43.260]  can meet the shock groups and the information war.
[1:54:43.260 --> 1:55:09.260]  We'll see you next time.
[1:55:09.260 --> 1:55:37.260]  Thank you.
[1:55:37.260 --> 1:55:40.260]  Go to m4store.com and start supporting your natural
[1:55:40.260 --> 1:55:44.260]  immune system now with the mega immune support pack.
[1:55:44.260 --> 1:55:49.260]  Now 40% off.
[1:55:49.260 --> 1:56:05.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:56:05.260 --> 1:56:10.260]  The top domestic violence extremist threat comes from
[1:56:10.260 --> 1:56:13.260]  racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists,
[1:56:13.260 --> 1:56:17.260]  specifically those who advocate for the superiority of the
[1:56:17.260 --> 1:56:18.260]  white race.
[1:56:18.260 --> 1:56:21.260]  According to the intelligence community, terrorism from white
[1:56:21.260 --> 1:56:26.260]  supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today.
[1:56:26.260 --> 1:56:29.260]  Because of this growth in polarization in the United States
[1:56:29.260 --> 1:56:32.260]  and domestic violence in white supremacist groups.
[1:56:32.260 --> 1:56:36.260]  So I know looking forward that the members of the Biden team
[1:56:36.260 --> 1:56:41.260]  who have been nominated or have been appointed are now moving
[1:56:41.260 --> 1:56:44.260]  in laser like fashion to try to uncover as much as they can
[1:56:44.260 --> 1:56:48.260]  about what looks very similar to insurgency movements that
[1:56:48.260 --> 1:56:49.260]  we've seen overseas.
[1:56:49.260 --> 1:56:52.260]  The rise of domestic violent extremism is a serious and
[1:56:52.260 --> 1:56:54.260]  growing national security threat.
[1:56:54.260 --> 1:56:56.260]  The Biden administration will confront this threat with the
[1:56:56.260 --> 1:56:58.260]  necessary resources and resolve.
[1:56:58.260 --> 1:57:01.260]  In order to really tackle terrorism in this time
[1:57:01.260 --> 1:57:05.260]  domestically, you've got to attack and dismantle the
[1:57:05.260 --> 1:57:08.260]  command and control element of a terrorist group.
[1:57:08.260 --> 1:57:11.260]  And unfortunately, and I know this is painful to hear,
[1:57:11.260 --> 1:57:14.260]  that may mean people sitting in Congress right now,
[1:57:14.260 --> 1:57:17.260]  people in and around the former president.
[1:57:17.260 --> 1:57:19.260]  That's how you do this otherwise recruitment,
[1:57:19.260 --> 1:57:24.260]  inciting and cult like leadership continues to recruit
[1:57:24.260 --> 1:57:26.260]  people to violence.
[1:57:26.260 --> 1:57:29.260]  Our initial work on TV will broadly fall into three areas.
[1:57:29.260 --> 1:57:32.260]  The first is a tasking from President Biden sent to the
[1:57:32.260 --> 1:57:36.260]  ODNI today requesting a comprehensive threat assessment
[1:57:36.260 --> 1:57:40.260]  coordinated with the FBI and DHS on domestic violent
[1:57:40.260 --> 1:57:41.260]  extremism.
[1:57:41.260 --> 1:57:45.260]  You can be darned tootin that we are focused very,
[1:57:45.260 --> 1:57:48.260]  very hard on how can we get better sources,
[1:57:48.260 --> 1:57:51.260]  better information, better analysis so that we can make
[1:57:51.260 --> 1:57:53.260]  sure that something like what happened on January 6th
[1:57:53.260 --> 1:57:55.260]  never happens again.
[1:57:55.260 --> 1:57:58.260]  You can be darned tootin the FBI director is going to make
[1:57:58.260 --> 1:58:01.260]  sure we get sold out to China and the pedophiles and
[1:58:01.260 --> 1:58:04.260]  everything else.
[1:58:04.260 --> 1:58:06.260]  That's their job is to just hold the position,
[1:58:06.260 --> 1:58:09.260]  hold down America while the vampire sucks his dry.
[1:58:09.260 --> 1:58:12.260]  The national security apparatus is a straight jacket to
[1:58:12.260 --> 1:58:15.260]  keep us tied down while the country is destroyed.
[1:58:15.260 --> 1:58:18.260]  You see it everywhere.
[1:58:18.260 --> 1:58:20.260]  What a group of monsters.
[1:58:20.260 --> 1:58:23.260]  And then imagine that statement out of all of them.
[1:58:23.260 --> 1:58:26.260]  Oh, we've got to frustrate these terror networks.
[1:58:26.260 --> 1:58:30.260]  Trump's existence and the people around him and the
[1:58:30.260 --> 1:58:33.260]  talk show host in Congress, they've got to be gotten
[1:58:33.260 --> 1:58:34.260]  rid of.
[1:58:34.260 --> 1:58:36.260]  Oh, because people want to elect them.
[1:58:36.260 --> 1:58:38.260]  People want to listen to them.
[1:58:38.260 --> 1:58:42.260]  These evil Americans like Alex Jones.
[1:58:42.260 --> 1:58:45.260]  They like Tucker Carlson.
[1:58:45.260 --> 1:58:47.260]  They like President Trump.
[1:58:47.260 --> 1:58:49.260]  They like free market.
[1:58:49.260 --> 1:58:51.260]  They like babies.
[1:58:51.260 --> 1:58:52.260]  They like guns.
[1:58:52.260 --> 1:58:53.260]  They like Jesus.
[1:58:53.260 --> 1:58:55.260]  No, no, no.
[1:58:55.260 --> 1:58:58.260]  You get drag clean story time.
[1:58:58.260 --> 1:59:01.260]  You get smuggled and kidnapped little kids.
[1:59:01.260 --> 1:59:03.260]  You get devalued currency.
[1:59:03.260 --> 1:59:04.260]  You get world government.
[1:59:04.260 --> 1:59:05.260]  You get.
[1:59:05.260 --> 1:59:07.260]  Fittin' all shipped in.
[1:59:07.260 --> 1:59:08.260]  You don't get that.
[1:59:08.260 --> 1:59:10.260]  No, no, no.
[1:59:10.260 --> 1:59:13.260]  We're the liberal masters.
[1:59:13.260 --> 1:59:15.260]  Charles, finish up your point about January 6th and
[1:59:15.260 --> 1:59:20.260]  where this is going.
[1:59:20.260 --> 1:59:23.260]  The vast majority of the people that went in on
[1:59:23.260 --> 1:59:28.260]  January 6th were some of the best patriots that we have.
[1:59:28.260 --> 1:59:30.260]  You know, they just got duped into going in there and
[1:59:30.260 --> 1:59:33.260]  being waved in by FBI and the cops and whatnot.
[1:59:33.260 --> 1:59:36.260]  Most of them walked through the velvet ropes, did
[1:59:36.260 --> 1:59:39.260]  nothing wrong, calls no violence.
[1:59:39.260 --> 1:59:42.260]  And, you know, these are incredible patriots and I
[1:59:42.260 --> 1:59:46.260]  want to see something else done to try to get them out.
[1:59:46.260 --> 1:59:47.260]  I agree.
[1:59:47.260 --> 1:59:52.260]  I'd like to see George Soros and I'd like to see Bill Gates
[1:59:52.260 --> 1:59:54.260]  and all them in solitary confinement.
[1:59:54.260 --> 1:59:56.260]  I mean, they deserve it.
[1:59:56.260 --> 1:59:58.260]  Oh, yeah.
[1:59:58.260 --> 1:59:59.260]  Yeah.
[1:59:59.260 --> 2:00:01.260]  Just for starters, you know, so we can get them tried
[2:00:01.260 --> 2:00:04.260]  and convicted and I have a few thoughts of what, you know,
[2:00:04.260 --> 2:00:07.260]  the penalty would be, but yeah, they're the ones who
[2:00:07.260 --> 2:00:12.260]  truly be behind, should be behind bars right now,
[2:00:12.260 --> 2:00:13.260]  not the patriots.
[2:00:13.260 --> 2:00:19.260]  What do you think about having a rally, you know,
[2:00:19.260 --> 2:00:21.260]  like we did with the Stop the Steals, but just having
[2:00:21.260 --> 2:00:26.260]  a very peaceful, peaceful rally, talking about due process,
[2:00:26.260 --> 2:00:30.260]  getting many, many thousands of patriots there and saying,
[2:00:30.260 --> 2:00:32.260]  we're not going to take this anymore.
[2:00:32.260 --> 2:00:34.260]  We want them to have due process.
[2:00:34.260 --> 2:00:36.260]  I think President Trump should have another rally in D.C.
[2:00:36.260 --> 2:00:38.260]  and make it all about how we're not going to be provocative,
[2:00:38.260 --> 2:00:40.260]  we're not going to be violent and we're against antifa.
[2:00:40.260 --> 2:00:42.260]  I think we should have a peaceful rally in D.C.
[2:00:42.260 --> 2:00:43.260]  for those that are held captive.
[2:00:43.260 --> 2:00:44.260]  I agree.
[2:00:44.260 --> 2:00:47.260]  Instead of running from September, instead of running
[2:00:47.260 --> 2:00:50.260]  from January 6, we need to run towards it and expose
[2:00:50.260 --> 2:00:54.260]  the globalist role.
[2:00:54.260 --> 2:00:57.260]  Three of our best-selling products are now back in stock
[2:00:57.260 --> 2:01:00.260]  after months and months of not being available because
[2:01:00.260 --> 2:01:03.260]  of the COVID lockdowns that destroyed the supply chain.
[2:01:03.260 --> 2:01:06.260]  Bio-true selenium is the highest quality selenium from
[2:01:06.260 --> 2:01:07.260]  the mustard seed.
[2:01:07.260 --> 2:01:10.260]  It is essential for all cellular activity in the body.
[2:01:10.260 --> 2:01:12.260]  It's critical and it funds in full war.
[2:01:12.260 --> 2:01:13.260]  It's back in stock.

[2:01:26.260 --> 2:01:29.260]  But then one more other great item is now back in stock.

[2:01:32.260 --> 2:01:33.260]  the benefits.

[2:01:37.260 --> 2:01:39.260]  shipping, double patriot points.

[2:02:12.260 --> 2:02:15.260]  We got some really big guests tomorrow in the special
[2:02:15.260 --> 2:02:16.260]  Saturday transmission.
[2:02:16.260 --> 2:02:19.260]  I'm going to take today and tomorrow with like five, six guests
[2:02:19.260 --> 2:02:22.260]  that's going to air commercial free.
[2:02:22.260 --> 2:02:23.260]  There'll be a few breaks.
[2:02:23.260 --> 2:02:25.260]  We're not going to run the regular commercial ads.
[2:02:25.260 --> 2:02:27.260]  I think it was like a three-hour show last weekend,
[2:02:27.260 --> 2:02:28.260]  and like five minutes was ads.
[2:02:28.260 --> 2:02:34.260]  But the point is it's going to be very powerful transmission
[2:02:34.260 --> 2:02:40.260]  this Saturday, 2 p.m. central, 3 p.m. eastern,
[2:02:40.260 --> 2:02:42.260]  that you're not going to want to miss.
[2:02:42.260 --> 2:02:49.260]  Now, I was given information that I'm not going to cover
[2:02:49.260 --> 2:02:55.260]  until Max Kaiser joins us at the bottom of the hour.
[2:02:55.260 --> 2:02:57.260]  And I want to ask the great intrepid crew,
[2:02:57.260 --> 2:02:59.260]  because the book's been out of print forever,
[2:02:59.260 --> 2:03:02.260]  but I know there's one around here.
[2:03:02.260 --> 2:03:10.260]  My book, 9-Eleven to Set the Tyranny, has this in it.
[2:03:10.260 --> 2:03:14.260]  I'll cover it bottom of the hour.
[2:03:14.260 --> 2:03:22.260]  They are now announcing matrix pots
[2:03:22.260 --> 2:03:25.260]  that people will put their bodies into,
[2:03:25.260 --> 2:03:27.260]  and the government is talking about it being punishment
[2:03:27.260 --> 2:03:34.260]  for you and your family.
[2:03:34.260 --> 2:03:38.260]  If we don't start caring about humanity
[2:03:38.260 --> 2:03:40.260]  and giving babies value and old people value,
[2:03:40.260 --> 2:03:42.260]  do you think any of us are safe?
[2:03:42.260 --> 2:03:47.260]  You have to understand there is a desire by the globalist
[2:03:47.260 --> 2:03:51.260]  to basically rip and tear humans apart.
[2:03:51.260 --> 2:03:53.260]  We've got to oppose these psychotics.
[2:03:53.260 --> 2:04:00.260]  They want to rape and attack everything you can imagine.
[2:04:00.260 --> 2:04:03.260]  Now, I told you the Pentagon, back in the 70s had a plan.
[2:04:03.260 --> 2:04:04.260]  We're already going there.
[2:04:04.260 --> 2:04:09.260]  We are to put us in tanks from birth
[2:04:09.260 --> 2:04:11.260]  to then feed us a virtual reality,
[2:04:11.260 --> 2:04:12.260]  because the argument would be,
[2:04:12.260 --> 2:04:14.260]  well, our brains all that matters,
[2:04:14.260 --> 2:04:16.260]  who cares if our body isn't real,
[2:04:16.260 --> 2:04:18.260]  so that no violence would ever be allowed,
[2:04:18.260 --> 2:04:21.260]  because basically you're born into a video game.
[2:04:21.260 --> 2:04:23.260]  It's total enslavement.
[2:04:23.260 --> 2:04:25.260]  It's prison to the next level.
[2:04:25.260 --> 2:04:29.260]  And so you see the matrix, 1999,
[2:04:29.260 --> 2:04:33.260]  that was all a Pentagon plan.
[2:04:33.260 --> 2:04:37.260]  We can say, well, plans are like rear ends.
[2:04:37.260 --> 2:04:38.260]  Everybody's got one.
[2:04:38.260 --> 2:04:41.260]  Yeah, but this group at DARPA had the plan
[2:04:41.260 --> 2:04:43.260]  for the Internet as well, and they got it.
[2:04:43.260 --> 2:04:46.260]  So it's just total nightmare, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:04:46.260 --> 2:04:49.260]  and I mean, it's never going to stop.
[2:04:49.260 --> 2:04:51.260]  They want to artificially cut off everything that's real
[2:04:51.260 --> 2:04:55.260]  that works to force us into the new system they're setting up.
[2:04:55.260 --> 2:04:58.260]  I'll talk about it with Max Kaiser, bottom of the hour.
[2:04:58.260 --> 2:05:02.260]  Let's go back to your phone calls and move quickly here.
[2:05:02.260 --> 2:05:04.260]  Aaron, thank you for letting us call you back.
[2:05:04.260 --> 2:05:05.260]  You were left on hold yesterday.
[2:05:05.260 --> 2:05:06.260]  We appreciate you.
[2:05:06.260 --> 2:05:08.260]  South Carolina, go ahead.
[2:05:08.260 --> 2:05:10.260]  You're on the air.
[2:05:10.260 --> 2:05:11.260]  You're welcome.
[2:05:11.260 --> 2:05:13.260]  I was there with you January 6th.
[2:05:13.260 --> 2:05:16.260]  We exchanged a couple of God blesses.
[2:05:16.260 --> 2:05:18.260]  I've got a question for you.
[2:05:18.260 --> 2:05:20.260]  I promise I'm going somewhere with a question,
[2:05:20.260 --> 2:05:23.260]  and then if you want me to play it, I can do that as well.
[2:05:23.260 --> 2:05:27.260]  My question, Alex, have you seen any of the chosen shows,
[2:05:27.260 --> 2:05:30.260]  the ones about Jesus that have been coming out recently?
[2:05:30.260 --> 2:05:32.260]  No, I'll be honest.
[2:05:32.260 --> 2:05:34.260]  I mean, I watch very little TV.
[2:05:34.260 --> 2:05:35.260]  Okay.
[2:05:35.260 --> 2:05:39.260]  Well, listen, I would encourage you to watch the last one,
[2:05:39.260 --> 2:05:43.260]  five or six, but it's about John the Baptist and Jesus.
[2:05:43.260 --> 2:05:45.260]  They're having this conversation.
[2:05:45.260 --> 2:05:47.260]  John's talking about what he has to do.
[2:05:47.260 --> 2:05:49.260]  He has to go confront Aaron.
[2:05:49.260 --> 2:05:51.260]  He has to.
[2:05:51.260 --> 2:05:54.260]  And while he's doing that, Jesus knows, man,
[2:05:54.260 --> 2:05:56.260]  this is the last time I'm going to see my cousin.
[2:05:56.260 --> 2:05:57.260]  He's about to get killed.
[2:05:57.260 --> 2:06:02.260]  So he tells him, John, I know you're going to do what you're going to do.
[2:06:02.260 --> 2:06:05.260]  Just listen to God as you do it.
[2:06:05.260 --> 2:06:07.260]  I think that's a message for you, man.
[2:06:07.260 --> 2:06:12.260]  Alex, I really believe that you're a prophet to the United States of America,
[2:06:12.260 --> 2:06:14.260]  possibly the world.
[2:06:14.260 --> 2:06:18.260]  And it's really important that you listen to God.
[2:06:18.260 --> 2:06:19.260]  You do it his way.
[2:06:19.260 --> 2:06:21.260]  The stakes are so high right now.
[2:06:21.260 --> 2:06:22.260]  Well, don't worry.
[2:06:22.260 --> 2:06:24.260]  I am and that my God's telling me attack.
[2:06:24.260 --> 2:06:26.260]  God's telling me go full speed.
[2:06:26.260 --> 2:06:27.260]  Okay.
[2:06:27.260 --> 2:06:28.260]  Okay.
[2:06:28.260 --> 2:06:29.260]  That's cool.
[2:06:29.260 --> 2:06:31.260]  And listen, I'll stand with you.
[2:06:31.260 --> 2:06:32.260]  I stand with you, brother.
[2:06:32.260 --> 2:06:35.260]  And in fact, another thing I wanted to say,
[2:06:35.260 --> 2:06:37.260]  every single person listening right now,
[2:06:37.260 --> 2:06:39.260]  every single person.
[2:06:39.260 --> 2:06:41.260]  Go to the website, go to n4.
[2:06:41.260 --> 2:06:44.260]  If all you can donate is a dollar.
[2:06:44.260 --> 2:06:48.260]  Just give something today.
[2:06:48.260 --> 2:06:51.260]  Well, that's my only concern is they won't be smart if they,
[2:06:51.260 --> 2:06:53.260]  and I'm not comparing myself to John the Baptist,
[2:06:53.260 --> 2:06:55.260]  but everything's an archetype of that.
[2:06:55.260 --> 2:06:59.260]  That's why so many patriots, they kill them and their family to blame the person
[2:06:59.260 --> 2:07:00.260]  for killing their family.
[2:07:00.260 --> 2:07:03.260]  I would never kill my family and that's the type of thing they would pull.
[2:07:03.260 --> 2:07:08.260]  So they're going to want to try to kill me in a discrediting way.
[2:07:08.260 --> 2:07:12.260]  So that's why, I mean, I'm a pretty straight-laced guy.
[2:07:12.260 --> 2:07:13.260]  There's not really any way to do that.
[2:07:13.260 --> 2:07:15.260]  I'm not, I'm not speaking that over you.
[2:07:15.260 --> 2:07:16.260]  I don't want that to happen.
[2:07:16.260 --> 2:07:18.260]  No, no, no, no, no, it needs to be said.
[2:07:18.260 --> 2:07:20.260]  No, believe me, we're in the season.
[2:07:20.260 --> 2:07:21.260]  Are you kidding?
[2:07:21.260 --> 2:07:22.260]  They want me dead so bad.
[2:07:22.260 --> 2:07:24.260]  We have crippled them.
[2:07:24.260 --> 2:07:26.260]  We just broadcast all of you listeners together.
[2:07:26.260 --> 2:07:31.260]  They know we are the big enemy and we've already inspired so many other people.
[2:07:31.260 --> 2:07:35.260]  Like I told everybody, Joe Rogan's about to get super hardcore six months ago.
[2:07:35.260 --> 2:07:37.260]  People thought I was making it up.
[2:07:37.260 --> 2:07:40.260]  Now Joe's super hardcore and I'm going to not name other names,
[2:07:40.260 --> 2:07:43.260]  but it's been all of us together that have done this.
[2:07:43.260 --> 2:07:49.260]  And so I've always seen our job as prepping and driving the next big awakening.
[2:07:49.260 --> 2:07:53.260]  And I can now sit back and see our success together because all of you are just as
[2:07:53.260 --> 2:07:58.260]  important as I am, is that we have influenced the entire resistance movement
[2:07:58.260 --> 2:07:59.260]  and the main opposition.
[2:07:59.260 --> 2:08:00.260]  So it's a beautiful time.
[2:08:00.260 --> 2:08:02.260]  What else do you want to say, brother?
[2:08:02.260 --> 2:08:06.260]  Hey, everybody listening, get on the phone with your representatives.
[2:08:06.260 --> 2:08:07.260]  Get on there.
[2:08:07.260 --> 2:08:09.260]  Tell them about the FBI.
[2:08:09.260 --> 2:08:10.260]  They need to be investigated.
[2:08:10.260 --> 2:08:12.260]  So let's put some pressure on these people.
[2:08:12.260 --> 2:08:14.260]  Let's stay at peace, brother.
[2:08:14.260 --> 2:08:16.260]  Listen, I'm with you, man.
[2:08:16.260 --> 2:08:17.260]  I'm glad you're doing what you're doing.
[2:08:17.260 --> 2:08:18.260]  I love you.
[2:08:18.260 --> 2:08:19.260]  I love you too, brother.
[2:08:19.260 --> 2:08:20.260]  I appreciate you.
[2:08:20.260 --> 2:08:22.260]  No, I mean, I've said that prayer many times.
[2:08:22.260 --> 2:08:23.260]  Tell me what you want me to do.
[2:08:23.260 --> 2:08:24.260]  God's like my whole life.
[2:08:24.260 --> 2:08:25.260]  You sure you want it?
[2:08:25.260 --> 2:08:26.260]  You sure you want it?
[2:08:26.260 --> 2:08:28.260]  And every step is like more pressure, more pressure, more pressure.
[2:08:28.260 --> 2:08:33.260]  And now it's like I'm not even questioning, but it's like you asked for this and I do
[2:08:33.260 --> 2:08:34.260]  it.
[2:08:34.260 --> 2:08:35.260]  Do it now.
[2:08:35.260 --> 2:08:40.260]  And I mean, I just want to be the best I can be and be the strongest and really deliver
[2:08:40.260 --> 2:08:44.260]  as much truth as I can and attack this thing head on.
[2:08:44.260 --> 2:08:45.260]  It's a real honor.
[2:08:45.260 --> 2:08:47.260]  I'm not looking forward to whatever it is they're going to do to me.
[2:08:47.260 --> 2:08:48.260]  And I just trust in God.
[2:08:48.260 --> 2:08:49.260]  That's all that matters.
[2:08:49.260 --> 2:08:51.260]  But all the flesh has to be burned away.
[2:08:51.260 --> 2:08:53.260]  And it will be burned away.
[2:08:53.260 --> 2:08:57.260]  I just every moment of my life, I do not want to be the attorney general.
[2:08:57.260 --> 2:09:00.260]  I do not want to be the Queen of England.
[2:09:00.260 --> 2:09:02.260]  I do not want to be the globalist.
[2:09:02.260 --> 2:09:07.260]  They're so out of their minds, just toddling around about to be destroyed, all of it.
[2:09:07.260 --> 2:09:09.260]  I want to be far away from them.
[2:09:09.260 --> 2:09:11.260]  And so I'm right where I want to be.
[2:09:11.260 --> 2:09:13.260]  All right, let's go ahead and take more calls.
[2:09:13.260 --> 2:09:14.260]  Who's up next here?
[2:09:14.260 --> 2:09:17.260]  Let's go to Deshaun in California.
[2:09:17.260 --> 2:09:19.260]  Deshaun, thanks for holding.
[2:09:19.260 --> 2:09:20.260]  Welcome.
[2:09:20.260 --> 2:09:22.260]  All right, Alex, this is what it is.
[2:09:22.260 --> 2:09:24.260]  This is the next big thing they're going to do.
[2:09:24.260 --> 2:09:26.260]  America is so scared right now.
[2:09:26.260 --> 2:09:29.260]  They're going to fake a nuclear attack on us.
[2:09:29.260 --> 2:09:32.260]  And the people are going to just hide in their house again.
[2:09:32.260 --> 2:09:38.260]  And then that's when they're going to bring up their little SS Nazis and come after us.
[2:09:38.260 --> 2:09:40.260]  Is that what your gut's telling you?
[2:09:40.260 --> 2:09:43.260]  Yeah, because I think space alien attack, nuclear attack.
[2:09:43.260 --> 2:09:45.260]  Anything goes now.
[2:09:45.260 --> 2:09:47.260]  Yeah, because we believe the virus.
[2:09:47.260 --> 2:09:51.260]  So therefore the whole world kind of scared right now.
[2:09:51.260 --> 2:09:54.260]  You can fake a nuclear war with us and they're going to believe it.
[2:09:54.260 --> 2:09:58.260]  You can blow up a couple of mountains over here and they will swear we was attacked by China.
[2:09:58.260 --> 2:10:03.260]  So they can probably use that just to keep us in check and on lockdown period.
[2:10:03.260 --> 2:10:07.260]  And then they're going to have it to where you can only come out on Tuesdays and Wednesdays
[2:10:07.260 --> 2:10:10.260]  when it might not be an attack or Wednesday or Friday.
[2:10:10.260 --> 2:10:12.260]  That's what they're going to do to us.
[2:10:12.260 --> 2:10:16.260]  And that's going to push in the green agenda and we can't use the water.
[2:10:16.260 --> 2:10:21.260]  This is a whole sabotage attack.
[2:10:21.260 --> 2:10:22.260]  I agree with you.
[2:10:22.260 --> 2:10:23.260]  That's the fact.
[2:10:23.260 --> 2:10:24.260]  You're the type of caller I've been looking for.
[2:10:24.260 --> 2:10:25.260]  All the callers are great.
[2:10:25.260 --> 2:10:27.260]  But what can they pull?
[2:10:27.260 --> 2:10:33.260]  Yeah, a limited nuclear attack, a cyber lockdown, a fake alien invasion.
[2:10:33.260 --> 2:10:35.260]  I mean, they're all got it all ready.
[2:10:35.260 --> 2:10:37.260]  What else do you think?
[2:10:37.260 --> 2:10:39.260]  Look, there's nothing I want to get at you with this.
[2:10:39.260 --> 2:10:42.260]  Listen, blacks is 13% of the population.
[2:10:42.260 --> 2:10:45.260]  There won't be no race right.
[2:10:45.260 --> 2:10:48.260]  We just waited for y'all to rise up.
[2:10:48.260 --> 2:10:49.260]  It's the white man.
[2:10:49.260 --> 2:10:51.260]  You were at war with yourself.
[2:10:51.260 --> 2:10:53.260]  No, I get it.
[2:10:53.260 --> 2:10:59.260]  The globalists want to start a war with the globalist attacking Americans and claim it's black people.
[2:10:59.260 --> 2:11:00.260]  I totally agree with you.
[2:11:00.260 --> 2:11:01.260]  It's not true.
[2:11:01.260 --> 2:11:03.260]  Yeah, but like, but like, no, but try to worry yourself.
[2:11:03.260 --> 2:11:06.260]  This is falling like Europe and like Rome.
[2:11:06.260 --> 2:11:09.260]  You got some evil leaders at the top of Nate White.
[2:11:09.260 --> 2:11:11.260]  And like I said, they want to kill y'all off too.
[2:11:11.260 --> 2:11:15.260]  So Joe Biden is the bloods and y'all guys are the crypts.
[2:11:15.260 --> 2:11:19.260]  Y'all are going to have to collide with each other period to save this Republic, man.
[2:11:19.260 --> 2:11:22.260]  And like I say, it ain't about the black or white issue.
[2:11:22.260 --> 2:11:25.260]  We know what's going on and a lot of blacks is doing dates.
[2:11:25.260 --> 2:11:26.260]  They're waking up to it.
[2:11:26.260 --> 2:11:27.260]  You know what I'm saying?
[2:11:27.260 --> 2:11:29.260]  But it's up to the white man.
[2:11:29.260 --> 2:11:31.260]  It's up to y'all to take this country back, man.
[2:11:31.260 --> 2:11:33.260]  Brother, I think it's up to all of us to show them.
[2:11:33.260 --> 2:11:35.260]  But I love you and I appreciate your powerful color.
[2:11:35.260 --> 2:11:36.260]  Wow.
[2:11:36.260 --> 2:11:38.260]  That's why I need to take more calls.
[2:11:38.260 --> 2:11:40.260]  And tomorrow I'm taking a bunch of calls.
[2:11:40.260 --> 2:11:43.260]  I got five guests set up so far.
[2:11:43.260 --> 2:11:44.260]  Five of them.
[2:11:44.260 --> 2:11:45.260]  Big guests.
[2:11:45.260 --> 2:11:46.260]  2 p.m. tomorrow.
[2:11:46.260 --> 2:11:47.260]  You're going to hear them.
[2:11:47.260 --> 2:11:48.260]  Wow.
[2:11:48.260 --> 2:11:49.260]  I appreciate the crew doing a great job.

[2:15:59.260 --> 2:16:02.260]  The globalists think they're going to win.
[2:16:02.260 --> 2:16:04.260]  They're not going to win.
[2:16:04.260 --> 2:16:06.260]  Some of the big articles on InfoWars.com,
[2:16:06.260 --> 2:16:11.260]  community and Jimmy Doris still suffering from side effects of two months after Moderna Javs.
[2:16:11.260 --> 2:16:14.260]  They're going to have problems.
[2:16:14.260 --> 2:16:16.260]  Healthy guy before that.
[2:16:16.260 --> 2:16:18.260]  And I'm hardly walking up the stairs now.
[2:16:18.260 --> 2:16:20.260]  Holocaust Survivor Worms, great reset.
[2:16:20.260 --> 2:16:22.260]  Worst in Hitler's master plan.
[2:16:22.260 --> 2:16:23.260]  This is global.
[2:16:23.260 --> 2:16:26.260]  We've got all that coming up today.
[2:16:26.260 --> 2:16:34.260]  InfoWars.com is the main site to spread the light.
[2:16:34.260 --> 2:16:38.260]  Let's go to, this is one of the longest here.
[2:16:38.260 --> 2:16:39.260]  Let me look.
[2:16:39.260 --> 2:16:42.260]  In Virginia, that's a color and color for 20 years.
[2:16:42.260 --> 2:16:44.260]  I'll tell her welcome, sir.
[2:16:44.260 --> 2:16:48.260]  So, Alex, first off, I want to give you some product placement.
[2:16:48.260 --> 2:16:51.260]  Everybody that's looking for a blast from the past,
[2:16:51.260 --> 2:16:53.260]  you might want to check out Dr. Jones Naturals.
[2:16:53.260 --> 2:16:54.260]  That's all I'm going to say on that.
[2:16:54.260 --> 2:16:57.260]  Your mouth will thank you for it.
[2:16:57.260 --> 2:17:02.260]  I have a question regarding the vitamin mineral fusion and the new multivitamin you came out.
[2:17:02.260 --> 2:17:03.260]  Which one do you use?
[2:17:03.260 --> 2:17:05.260]  Because I just bought, I just bought the free pack.
[2:17:05.260 --> 2:17:09.260]  I want to know which one you think is better in the total before I go to my point.
[2:17:09.260 --> 2:17:11.260]  They're all three different things.
[2:17:11.260 --> 2:17:13.260]  I just went out and said, there's a market for this.
[2:17:13.260 --> 2:17:14.260]  It works good.
[2:17:14.260 --> 2:17:15.260]  And they're all three different things.
[2:17:15.260 --> 2:17:16.260]  I was going to take one of them.
[2:17:16.260 --> 2:17:18.260]  I take the multivitamin.
[2:17:18.260 --> 2:17:19.260]  But the vitamin C is incredible.
[2:17:19.260 --> 2:17:22.260]  The vitamin, I mean, I get a lot of sun, so I don't need D3.
[2:17:22.260 --> 2:17:24.260]  Yeah.
[2:17:24.260 --> 2:17:25.260]  Okay.
[2:17:25.260 --> 2:17:27.260]  Two things I wanted to suggest.
[2:17:27.260 --> 2:17:29.260]  An unvaxed life matters t-shirt.
[2:17:29.260 --> 2:17:31.260]  I've been trying to get a quality for a month about this.
[2:17:31.260 --> 2:17:36.260]  That will sell, you could probably make that for three or four years running and that'll be your best selling shirt.
[2:17:36.260 --> 2:17:37.260]  That's a genius shirt.
[2:17:37.260 --> 2:17:40.260]  We'll put out unvaxed lives matter right now.
[2:17:40.260 --> 2:17:41.260]  Okay.
[2:17:41.260 --> 2:17:46.260]  And then I would, I know you were having issues making the Obama deception too because everything was moving so fast.
[2:17:46.260 --> 2:17:52.260]  Think about Obama deception too, the Joe Obama deception or just the Joe Obama deception.
[2:17:52.260 --> 2:17:55.260]  So I wanted to get to the great reset.
[2:17:55.260 --> 2:17:58.260]  So you see now they're talking about it on Fox News.
[2:17:58.260 --> 2:17:59.260]  That's you.
[2:17:59.260 --> 2:18:00.260]  You did that.
[2:18:00.260 --> 2:18:01.260]  Well, let's be clear.
[2:18:01.260 --> 2:18:02.260]  That's our audience.
[2:18:02.260 --> 2:18:03.260]  Seriously.
[2:18:03.260 --> 2:18:05.260]  It's not me patting on the head.
[2:18:05.260 --> 2:18:08.260]  If you guys and gals don't spread the word, this is you.
[2:18:08.260 --> 2:18:13.260]  This is we have an audience to push this out and make people look at it.
[2:18:13.260 --> 2:18:16.260]  So, and you asked me about 10 years ago what I thought was next.
[2:18:16.260 --> 2:18:22.260]  And it was when they, when it was specifically about gun confiscation, they're not going to take your gun.
[2:18:22.260 --> 2:18:25.260]  People are going to turn them in because it's going to get so bad.
[2:18:25.260 --> 2:18:28.260]  And if you want to eat and you want to drink, you're going to give up.
[2:18:28.260 --> 2:18:29.260]  Exactly.
[2:18:29.260 --> 2:18:30.260]  That's a good score.
[2:18:30.260 --> 2:18:32.260]  You got to turn the gun in for the money.
[2:18:32.260 --> 2:18:34.260]  So that's where this is going.
[2:18:34.260 --> 2:18:37.260]  That's what that's why Klaus Schwab is so arrogant.
[2:18:37.260 --> 2:18:43.260]  He's up there basically telling you you're created multi quadrillions of fake money.
[2:18:43.260 --> 2:18:45.260]  The real assets are a fraction of that.
[2:18:45.260 --> 2:18:48.260]  They can dictate our surrender, they think.
[2:18:48.260 --> 2:18:51.260]  So we do need a great reset, but we need to reset them.
[2:18:51.260 --> 2:18:53.260]  You cannot compete with you.
[2:18:53.260 --> 2:18:54.260]  It's a fact.
[2:18:54.260 --> 2:18:55.260]  I heard this.
[2:18:55.260 --> 2:18:58.260]  You can't compete with global firms that have given themselves trillions.
[2:18:58.260 --> 2:18:59.260]  Correct.
[2:18:59.260 --> 2:19:06.260]  So my thing with Trump, Trump, stay off the left, right thing.
[2:19:06.260 --> 2:19:08.260]  If you play the cards, right?
[2:19:08.260 --> 2:19:14.260]  If you play that I'm fighting the system that is screwing you every day and they're coming after me too,
[2:19:14.260 --> 2:19:16.260]  everybody is going to join your side.
[2:19:16.260 --> 2:19:18.260]  But you need to point out the great reset.
[2:19:18.260 --> 2:19:19.260]  You need to point out.
[2:19:19.260 --> 2:19:20.260]  I agree.
[2:19:20.260 --> 2:19:21.260]  I agree.
[2:19:21.260 --> 2:19:25.260]  If Trump comes out with a great reset and announces America is under globalist takeover,
[2:19:25.260 --> 2:19:30.260]  it's over, he totally wins and that's why they want to get rid of them before he figures it out.
[2:19:30.260 --> 2:19:38.260]  And that's why it's so dangerous that we've got Fox News starting to talk about this because that's all Trump listens to.
[2:19:38.260 --> 2:19:44.260]  The thing is, is that if he doesn't understand it, people around him do.
[2:19:44.260 --> 2:19:45.260]  General Flynn does.
[2:19:45.260 --> 2:19:47.260]  Roger Stone does.
[2:19:47.260 --> 2:19:48.260]  People around him.
[2:19:48.260 --> 2:19:49.260]  Tucker Carlson does.
[2:19:49.260 --> 2:19:54.260]  So if get them, get yourself to get the points to him.
[2:19:54.260 --> 2:19:58.260]  Well, I can tell you, Tucker gave him all the points and Trump didn't listen.
[2:19:58.260 --> 2:20:00.260]  And that's why Tucker's pissed off at Trump.
[2:20:00.260 --> 2:20:01.260]  I'll just leave it at that.
[2:20:01.260 --> 2:20:03.260]  But yeah, no, I hear you.
[2:20:03.260 --> 2:20:04.260]  Absolutely.
[2:20:04.260 --> 2:20:05.260]  And Trump's an incredible asset.
[2:20:05.260 --> 2:20:09.260]  It's why they want him out of the picture so he doesn't lead a takeover of the Republican Party,
[2:20:09.260 --> 2:20:11.260]  which we're one inch away from.
[2:20:11.260 --> 2:20:12.260]  We are so close to victory.
[2:20:12.260 --> 2:20:15.260]  It's why the deep state is so dangerous and it's going to launch terror attacks,
[2:20:15.260 --> 2:20:17.260]  claiming conservatives are white supremacists.
[2:20:17.260 --> 2:20:18.260]  White supremacists.
[2:20:18.260 --> 2:20:19.260]  I love everybody.
[2:20:19.260 --> 2:20:20.260]  That is a load of crap.
[2:20:20.260 --> 2:20:21.260]  They are the depopulations.
[2:20:21.260 --> 2:20:23.260]  I've never done a white supremacist in my life.
[2:20:23.260 --> 2:20:24.260]  Absolutely.
[2:20:24.260 --> 2:20:25.260]  We know that.
[2:20:25.260 --> 2:20:26.260]  I'll kill her.
[2:20:26.260 --> 2:20:27.260]  Thank you.
[2:20:27.260 --> 2:20:28.260]  But we got to get back in their face.
[2:20:28.260 --> 2:20:29.260]  They got to get back in their face with this.
[2:20:29.260 --> 2:20:31.260]  And it's not the black people doing it.
[2:20:31.260 --> 2:20:37.260]  It's the white liberal academics that want to rule the world that are using this for control.
[2:20:37.260 --> 2:20:38.260]  All right.
[2:20:38.260 --> 2:20:39.260]  Kevin in New York.
[2:20:39.260 --> 2:20:41.260]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:20:41.260 --> 2:20:42.260]  Hey, Alex.
[2:20:42.260 --> 2:20:43.260]  How are we doing?
[2:20:43.260 --> 2:20:44.260]  Good, bro.
[2:20:44.260 --> 2:20:45.260]  Good.
[2:20:45.260 --> 2:20:46.260]  Good.
[2:20:46.260 --> 2:20:48.260]  So I have kind of an idea that.
[2:20:48.260 --> 2:20:53.260]  You know, it's going to be hard to effectively hear your audience hear the world or what's
[2:20:53.260 --> 2:20:58.260]  about to strike this country because we need to really sit down and take a look back.
[2:20:58.260 --> 2:21:03.260]  Back to 9 11, we can go back to 1967, the USS Liberty.
[2:21:03.260 --> 2:21:05.260]  There's going to be something big coming.
[2:21:05.260 --> 2:21:10.260]  And I mean, it's not going to be a mass shooting because they really need to demonize the white
[2:21:10.260 --> 2:21:15.260]  Christian, not even white, just the Christian ethos, the people who have a heritage in this
[2:21:15.260 --> 2:21:16.260]  country.
[2:21:16.260 --> 2:21:18.260]  That's the class they need to go after.
[2:21:18.260 --> 2:21:23.260]  And the majority of those people are white, but there's a lot of other ethnicities that
[2:21:23.260 --> 2:21:27.260]  follow this Americana ethos, this Christian ethos.
[2:21:27.260 --> 2:21:32.260]  In order to do that and to strike at the heart of that, they need a big event.
[2:21:32.260 --> 2:21:34.260]  It's something on the scale of 9 11.
[2:21:34.260 --> 2:21:35.260]  Yes.
[2:21:35.260 --> 2:21:36.260]  So is it a giant cyber attack?
[2:21:36.260 --> 2:21:37.260]  A new war?
[2:21:37.260 --> 2:21:38.260]  A new virus?
[2:21:38.260 --> 2:21:39.260]  A race war?
[2:21:39.260 --> 2:21:46.220]  Well, to trigger any of that, I think it's going to be an attack on some federal building
[2:21:46.220 --> 2:21:48.220]  either in DC or in some capital.
[2:21:48.220 --> 2:21:52.220]  That's why I always tell people stay away from those places in the next coming years.
[2:21:52.220 --> 2:21:58.220]  But I think what your show needs to do, and you need to do cross collaboration with a lot
[2:21:58.220 --> 2:22:04.220]  of third parties that have studied 9 11, studied USS Liberty, studied these big attacks and
[2:22:04.220 --> 2:22:05.220]  have like a big forum.
[2:22:05.220 --> 2:22:13.220]  I mean, I said three weeks ago with Nick Fuentes and others, we need a forum on January 6.
[2:22:13.220 --> 2:22:15.220]  And now you see that public forum happening.
[2:22:15.220 --> 2:22:19.220]  We need to have a giant debate about what's their next false flag because we can always
[2:22:19.220 --> 2:22:22.220]  study the last event, the last war, they're going to play that card.
[2:22:22.220 --> 2:22:24.220]  That's their card.
[2:22:24.220 --> 2:22:25.220]  Right.
[2:22:25.220 --> 2:22:26.220]  Yeah.
[2:22:26.220 --> 2:22:31.220]  I think if you really dig into 9 11 and show sort of the methods that they use and stuff
[2:22:31.220 --> 2:22:35.220]  in that, you can really bring up the 9 11 truth or movement again, get that going because
[2:22:35.220 --> 2:22:37.220]  that really is the Achilles heel.
[2:22:37.220 --> 2:22:42.220]  I think if the more Americans that are awake to the truth of 9 11, the more we're going
[2:22:42.220 --> 2:22:44.220]  to win to our side.
[2:22:44.220 --> 2:22:48.220]  People are going to begin to understand how these people work and the cards that they play
[2:22:48.220 --> 2:22:51.220]  because it's the same formula they use over and over again.
[2:22:51.220 --> 2:22:55.220]  And I think that's what frustrates me is it's so damn formulae, but people go, why is it
[2:22:55.220 --> 2:22:56.220]  formulae?
[2:22:56.220 --> 2:22:57.220]  Because it works.
[2:22:57.220 --> 2:22:58.220]  Right.
[2:22:58.220 --> 2:23:01.220]  Because human psychology and human nature is never changed.
[2:23:01.220 --> 2:23:03.220]  It's the same throughout millennia.
[2:23:03.220 --> 2:23:10.220]  And I know you don't hit this too much, but I wish you would talk more about the history
[2:23:10.220 --> 2:23:14.220]  of the Bolshevik era, the USSR takeover with Lenin install on this.
[2:23:14.220 --> 2:23:18.220]  I know you're talking about the Maoist revolution, but really the formulae.
[2:23:18.220 --> 2:23:24.220]  I mean, this is all the same play that was done to Russia and then magnified by China
[2:23:24.220 --> 2:23:28.220]  because the globalists lost control of Russia and now they China is their big baby.
[2:23:28.220 --> 2:23:29.220]  But I hear you.
[2:23:29.220 --> 2:23:33.220]  It's the exact same playbook and it is very cold-blooded folks that think it's their right
[2:23:33.220 --> 2:23:34.220]  to rule over us.
[2:23:34.220 --> 2:23:36.220]  And we've just got to say no to it.
[2:23:36.220 --> 2:23:37.220]  Thank you so much.
[2:23:37.220 --> 2:23:38.220]  All right.
[2:23:38.220 --> 2:23:40.220]  I know we got loaded phones.
[2:23:40.220 --> 2:23:41.220]  We got Max Kaiser coming up.
[2:23:41.220 --> 2:23:43.220]  Then I'm going to jam those calls in.
[2:23:43.220 --> 2:23:46.220]  And then a special guest is coming up.
[2:23:46.220 --> 2:23:48.220]  Stay with us infowars.com.
[2:23:48.220 --> 2:23:49.220]  Don't forget band.video.

[2:25:04.220 --> 2:25:09.220]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[2:25:09.220 --> 2:25:16.220]  Super male vitality, specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance

[2:25:37.220 --> 2:25:44.220]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[2:25:44.220 --> 2:25:47.220]  So what are you waiting for? Go to the infowars store.
[2:25:47.220 --> 2:25:50.220]  Never been a better time than right now.
[2:25:50.220 --> 2:25:54.220]  Super male vitality at infowarsstore.com.
[2:25:54.220 --> 2:25:59.220]  I started taking high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil more than a decade ago
[2:25:59.220 --> 2:26:01.220]  because the scientific literature is overwhelming.
[2:26:01.220 --> 2:26:05.220]  It's good for your heart, your brain, your whole body, your well-being.
[2:26:05.220 --> 2:26:07.220]  A lot of folks take it before they take tests.
[2:26:07.220 --> 2:26:09.220]  People that have arthritis pain, they take it.
[2:26:09.220 --> 2:26:12.220]  It's well known for the things it does for a body.
[2:26:12.220 --> 2:26:14.220]  It makes our lives so much better.
[2:26:14.220 --> 2:26:18.220]  Then I learned about high-grade fish oil and high-grade krill oil.
[2:26:18.220 --> 2:26:20.220]  We've got both at infowarsstore.com.
[2:26:20.220 --> 2:26:23.220]  But with the COVID lockdown, supply chains have broken down.
[2:26:23.220 --> 2:26:27.220]  So it's been months and months and months since we've had krill oil back in style.
[2:26:27.220 --> 2:26:28.220]  Well, let's back, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:26:28.220 --> 2:26:32.220]  And despite the fact that it's already very fairly priced for the grade it is,
[2:26:32.220 --> 2:26:36.220]  highest quality, we're offering it at 40% off for a limited time
[2:26:36.220 --> 2:26:40.220]  at infowarsstore.com with free shipping and double pay-through points.
[2:26:40.220 --> 2:26:42.220]  Because I want those of you that have already been customers
[2:26:42.220 --> 2:26:43.220]  to have a chance to get more of it.
[2:26:43.220 --> 2:26:46.220]  And I want new viewers and listeners who have tried it to get it from us.
[2:26:46.220 --> 2:26:51.220]  And then try regular krill oil that is not one-tenth as powerful as ours.
[2:26:51.220 --> 2:26:54.220]  This is the highest grade back in stock at infowarsstore.com.
[2:26:55.220 --> 2:26:59.220]  Info Wars is here because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:26:59.220 --> 2:27:01.220]  That's why I spent our motto for more than 25 years.
[2:27:01.220 --> 2:27:04.220]  And if you research, even the UN's own admissions,
[2:27:04.220 --> 2:27:08.220]  over 2 billion people on planet Earth out of 7.5 billion
[2:27:08.220 --> 2:27:10.220]  have cognitive disabilities.
[2:27:10.220 --> 2:27:13.220]  Lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[2:27:13.220 --> 2:27:16.220]  That's why they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food,
[2:27:16.220 --> 2:27:17.220]  isn't in the salt anymore.
[2:27:17.220 --> 2:27:22.220]  Now, regular iodine that you find in food is bound to different minerals.
[2:27:22.220 --> 2:27:24.220]  And so it's hard for your body to absorb.
[2:27:24.220 --> 2:27:26.220]  But if you get the proper type of iodine,
[2:27:26.220 --> 2:27:28.220]  there's three types that are good for the body,
[2:27:28.220 --> 2:27:29.220]  it does amazing things.
[2:27:29.220 --> 2:27:31.220]  It's essential in the body.
[2:27:31.220 --> 2:27:34.220]  But we have our amazing tri-iodine, a big shipment came in.
[2:27:34.220 --> 2:27:38.220]  And so we're able to offer it at the lowest price ever, 60% off.
[2:27:38.220 --> 2:27:43.220]  That is survival shield X3, 60% off with three types of powerful iodine.
[2:27:43.220 --> 2:27:47.220]  Tri-iodine is from a patented process that stabilizes the iodine
[2:27:47.220 --> 2:27:50.220]  and makes it even more powerful to sell at your level.
[2:27:50.220 --> 2:27:51.220]  You and your family will love it.
[2:27:51.220 --> 2:27:52.220]  It's incredible for your body.
[2:27:52.220 --> 2:27:54.220]  Get at infowarsstore.com today.
[2:27:54.220 --> 2:28:05.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:28:24.220 --> 2:28:42.220]  In my film, published in 2002,
[2:28:42.220 --> 2:28:43.220]  The Road to Tyranny.
[2:28:43.220 --> 2:28:47.220]  And then in my book, 9-11 Descent into Tyranny,
[2:28:47.220 --> 2:28:52.220]  I point directly at a Pentagon plan from 1977,
[2:28:52.220 --> 2:28:57.220]  declassified in 2000, but then reclassified later,
[2:28:57.220 --> 2:29:02.220]  to have humans born into artificial looms and put in tanks
[2:29:02.220 --> 2:29:04.220]  so there'd be no more crime.
[2:29:04.220 --> 2:29:06.220]  And from birth, we've been in artificial reality
[2:29:06.220 --> 2:29:08.220]  with wires plugged into our brains.
[2:29:08.220 --> 2:29:13.220]  And then the ruling class could make sure we had true peace.
[2:29:13.220 --> 2:29:17.220]  You know, that got turned into the film, The Matrix.
[2:29:17.220 --> 2:29:19.220]  But here's what I'm getting at.
[2:29:19.220 --> 2:29:24.220]  This startup harvest body heat to mine cryptocurrencies,
[2:29:24.220 --> 2:29:28.220]  the new stack.
[2:29:28.220 --> 2:29:29.220]  And they're going to say,
[2:29:29.220 --> 2:29:31.220]  the recent speculative craze over Bitcoin,
[2:29:31.220 --> 2:29:34.220]  and other cryptocurrencies has led to a growing number of people
[2:29:34.220 --> 2:29:37.220]  jumping on the viral bandwagon to mine and decentralize
[2:29:37.220 --> 2:29:39.220]  peer-to-peer digital currency,
[2:29:39.220 --> 2:29:44.220]  while it sounds like something empirical or intangible,
[2:29:44.220 --> 2:29:48.220]  the process of mining bitcoins has serious real-world impacts.
[2:29:48.220 --> 2:29:52.220]  And it goes in to say, the startup group wants you to lay in a bed
[2:29:52.220 --> 2:29:55.220]  that then takes your energy and your heat
[2:29:55.220 --> 2:29:58.220]  and then transfers it into Bitcoin.
[2:29:58.220 --> 2:30:05.220]  But the point is, that's the whole Matrix plan from the beginning.
[2:30:05.220 --> 2:30:09.220]  And so now Bitcoin is definitely revolutionizing a lot of things.
[2:30:09.220 --> 2:30:13.220]  The globals don't like it on some fronts.
[2:30:13.220 --> 2:30:16.220]  But you can also look at that Matrix level thing and just say,
[2:30:16.220 --> 2:30:17.220]  this is where the future is going.
[2:30:17.220 --> 2:30:19.220]  I wanted to bring that up first,
[2:30:19.220 --> 2:30:22.220]  because Max Kaiser had the Hollywood Stock Exchange.
[2:30:22.220 --> 2:30:23.220]  He predicted something like Bitcoin.
[2:30:23.220 --> 2:30:26.220]  He was an early adopter of it more than 10 years ago.
[2:30:26.220 --> 2:30:28.220]  He's been proven right about to a great extent.
[2:30:28.220 --> 2:30:31.220]  Now he's talking about Latin American countries
[2:30:31.220 --> 2:30:33.220]  mining it with volcanic energy.
[2:30:33.220 --> 2:30:34.220]  I mean, this is cutting-edge stuff.
[2:30:34.220 --> 2:30:38.220]  But he also coined the term the casino gulag,
[2:30:38.220 --> 2:30:42.220]  and really talked about how we'll turn the human into the commodity.
[2:30:42.220 --> 2:30:43.220]  And here we are.
[2:30:43.220 --> 2:30:45.220]  So that's just an interesting little angle.
[2:30:45.220 --> 2:30:47.220]  I know you also have your big tour coming up.
[2:30:47.220 --> 2:30:48.220]  We can't stay on air.
[2:30:48.220 --> 2:30:51.220]  We're on over 200 radio stations, but it's the F Elon tour.
[2:30:51.220 --> 2:30:53.220]  I guess folks are mad at Elon Musk,
[2:30:53.220 --> 2:30:55.220]  trying to take control of Bitcoin.
[2:30:55.220 --> 2:30:58.220]  And so we'll also talk about that here with Max Kaiser today.
[2:30:58.220 --> 2:31:01.220]  Max, good to have you with us.
[2:31:01.220 --> 2:31:04.220]  Hey Alex, great to be back with you.
[2:31:04.220 --> 2:31:08.220]  Yeah, the Bitcoin phenomenon is becoming global.
[2:31:08.220 --> 2:31:11.220]  And so now all the narratives are coming out.
[2:31:11.220 --> 2:31:13.220]  It's a big threat to central banks,
[2:31:13.220 --> 2:31:15.220]  the IMF, the World Bank, regular banks.
[2:31:15.220 --> 2:31:17.220]  So you're going to hear a lot of different narratives.
[2:31:17.220 --> 2:31:23.220]  That particular one about hooking up to some kind of human-enabled
[2:31:23.220 --> 2:31:26.220]  Bitcoin mining machine, et cetera.
[2:31:26.220 --> 2:31:29.220]  That's a narrative, and it's an interesting narrative.
[2:31:29.220 --> 2:31:33.220]  I think more importantly, what we're seeing in El Salvador right now
[2:31:33.220 --> 2:31:37.220]  is something that takes precedent when you're talking about Bitcoin
[2:31:37.220 --> 2:31:39.220]  and what's happening around the world.
[2:31:39.220 --> 2:31:44.220]  So here's a country that was being subjected to IMF
[2:31:44.220 --> 2:31:48.220]  kind of predatory lending and had a really tough time
[2:31:48.220 --> 2:31:51.220]  establishing their own sovereignty outside of the IMF.
[2:31:51.220 --> 2:31:53.220]  And what they said was, you know what,
[2:31:53.220 --> 2:31:56.220]  we're just going to step completely out of the U.S. dollar matrix.
[2:31:56.220 --> 2:31:59.220]  And that's where the matrix really resonates,
[2:31:59.220 --> 2:32:01.220]  is the U.S. dollar global matrix.
[2:32:01.220 --> 2:32:06.220]  They said we're going to make Bitcoin the legal tender here in El Salvador.
[2:32:06.220 --> 2:32:10.220]  And already, they're just enjoying tremendous benefits from it.
[2:32:10.220 --> 2:32:12.220]  Both the World Bank and the IMF have both said,
[2:32:12.220 --> 2:32:14.220]  hey, you know, you're not allowed to do that.
[2:32:14.220 --> 2:32:18.220]  As a matter of fact, the World Bank, which in their charter with El Salvador,
[2:32:18.220 --> 2:32:22.220]  said that there's nothing against them doing what they just did.
[2:32:22.220 --> 2:32:25.220]  But when they did what they just did, making Bitcoin legal tender,
[2:32:25.220 --> 2:32:28.220]  the World Bank said, you know what, we're going to rewrite our charter.
[2:32:28.220 --> 2:32:30.220]  So it's really forcing the hand of these globalists,
[2:32:30.220 --> 2:32:33.220]  these globalist banks and the IMF and the World Bank,
[2:32:33.220 --> 2:32:36.220]  and showing that there's not- And I just want to get into that.
[2:32:36.220 --> 2:32:38.220]  But the real reason you're on today, because you wanted to cover it,
[2:32:38.220 --> 2:32:40.220]  and I really respect your view on it,
[2:32:40.220 --> 2:32:42.220]  is you've been a former top-stop broker,
[2:32:42.220 --> 2:32:44.220]  really made a lot of economic predictions that have come through.
[2:32:44.220 --> 2:32:46.220]  A lot of numbers came out.
[2:32:46.220 --> 2:32:48.220]  I've got 20 articles or so here,
[2:32:48.220 --> 2:32:51.220]  but showing that inflation is much worse than the Federal Reserve
[2:32:51.220 --> 2:32:55.220]  and previously said, now the Federal Reserve's having to admit it's going to get really bad,
[2:32:55.220 --> 2:32:58.220]  claiming maybe interest rates increases are coming.
[2:32:58.220 --> 2:33:01.220]  What's the latest on inflation?
[2:33:01.220 --> 2:33:03.220]  Right. As we've been saying,
[2:33:03.220 --> 2:33:09.220]  that all the money printing is inevitably going to lead to real inflation.
[2:33:09.220 --> 2:33:11.220]  And the reason it's been masked for so many years
[2:33:11.220 --> 2:33:14.220]  is because labor has been outsourced to China,
[2:33:14.220 --> 2:33:19.220]  and so you don't really see inflation as such hitting in the supermarket
[2:33:19.220 --> 2:33:21.220]  or at the petrol station.
[2:33:21.220 --> 2:33:25.220]  But now that you've got wage parity between China and the U.S.,
[2:33:25.220 --> 2:33:29.220]  the actual inflation numbers are starting to be ratcheted up.
[2:33:29.220 --> 2:33:31.220]  So even the Federal Reserve Bank is saying,
[2:33:31.220 --> 2:33:33.220]  well, we're actually 3, 3.5%,
[2:33:33.220 --> 2:33:36.220]  which is well above the 2% we were talking about.
[2:33:36.220 --> 2:33:40.220]  The fact is, if you use to calculate inflation the way you should use it,
[2:33:40.220 --> 2:33:45.220]  which includes things like housing, healthcare, education, and things like that,
[2:33:45.220 --> 2:33:48.220]  the actual inflation rate in America right now is about 12%.
[2:33:48.220 --> 2:33:51.220]  The last time we had inflation this high,
[2:33:51.220 --> 2:33:54.220]  Paul Volcker, who was the central bank head chairman at that time,
[2:33:54.220 --> 2:33:56.220]  raised rates all the way up to 20%.
[2:33:56.220 --> 2:33:59.220]  But the central bank now is saying, oh, no, no, no.
[2:33:59.220 --> 2:34:02.220]  We can't raise rates. They just had a meeting.
[2:34:02.220 --> 2:34:03.220]  They did not raise rates.
[2:34:03.220 --> 2:34:08.220]  And they're saying that the inflation is transitory and it's not a problem.
[2:34:08.220 --> 2:34:12.220]  The reason they say that is because they're in the pocket of Wall Street,
[2:34:12.220 --> 2:34:15.220]  and Wall Street wants cheap rates to do their mergers and acquisitions
[2:34:15.220 --> 2:34:19.220]  and their other corporate activities at the cheapest possible price,
[2:34:19.220 --> 2:34:22.220]  which means the cheapest possible interest rates possible.
[2:34:22.220 --> 2:34:28.220]  So the Fed is working at completely odds with the interest of the average American.
[2:34:28.220 --> 2:34:30.220]  But isn't that because, as you just said,
[2:34:30.220 --> 2:34:35.220]  it's the most predatory Federal Reserve in its 100-plus years ever
[2:34:35.220 --> 2:34:39.220]  where this is totally against the average person, totally against the working class,
[2:34:39.220 --> 2:34:42.220]  completely against the middle class, all this free money to mega banks
[2:34:42.220 --> 2:34:46.220]  to then buy up every major supplement company we've used,
[2:34:46.220 --> 2:34:49.220]  except one has been bought out the last year.
[2:34:49.220 --> 2:34:52.220]  This is an example of the businesses I'm in.
[2:34:52.220 --> 2:34:54.220]  Almost all the textile companies have been bought out.
[2:34:54.220 --> 2:34:57.220]  Almost all the companies, they've got all this free money.
[2:34:57.220 --> 2:35:00.220]  As you said, they don't care that it inflates us and hurts our savings
[2:35:00.220 --> 2:35:04.220]  because in the process, they're buying up the world what you're saying.
[2:35:04.220 --> 2:35:05.220]  That's exactly correct.
[2:35:05.220 --> 2:35:08.220]  The fact that your company is their vendors, the people you do business with,
[2:35:08.220 --> 2:35:12.220]  they're all being bought up by private equity and other groups is a great example.
[2:35:12.220 --> 2:35:17.220]  They are able to borrow money for zero and they can buy up income-producing assets
[2:35:17.220 --> 2:35:20.220]  that money goes directly to the bottom line, didn't cost them anything.
[2:35:20.220 --> 2:35:22.220]  For you and I, we're living, or a lot of people in America,
[2:35:22.220 --> 2:35:24.220]  they're living on credit cards and other debts.
[2:35:24.220 --> 2:35:27.220]  They're paying 17, 18 percent, or they go to a payday lender
[2:35:27.220 --> 2:35:30.220]  and they pay 2,000 percent annual rates of interest.
[2:35:30.220 --> 2:35:32.220]  So it's what I call interest rate apartheid.
[2:35:32.220 --> 2:35:34.220]  It's zero percent for friends of Goldman Sachs.
[2:35:34.220 --> 2:35:36.220]  Everyone else pays 18 percent or above.
[2:35:36.220 --> 2:35:39.220]  And if you start the month, 18 percent of the whole,
[2:35:39.220 --> 2:35:41.220]  you've got to make 18 percent just to break even.
[2:35:41.220 --> 2:35:43.220]  A lot of people can't make it, so then they just go down.
[2:35:43.220 --> 2:35:47.220]  Here's the key I want your take on, the very same mega-fat cats
[2:35:47.220 --> 2:35:49.220]  and the big tech companies owning slave camps in China,
[2:35:49.220 --> 2:35:51.220]  they then fund Black Lives Matter
[2:35:51.220 --> 2:35:55.220]  and make it all about a fight between left and right or black and white
[2:35:55.220 --> 2:35:59.220]  while they're involved in the greatest criminal transfer of wealth the world's ever seen.
[2:35:59.220 --> 2:36:00.220]  It's a perfect smoke screen.
[2:36:00.220 --> 2:36:02.220]  I mean, actually bravo to them.
[2:36:02.220 --> 2:36:04.220]  They really are screwing people over.
[2:36:04.220 --> 2:36:06.220]  How do we counter them?
[2:36:06.220 --> 2:36:09.220]  Well, what you're describing there is we saw this in China
[2:36:09.220 --> 2:36:12.220]  during the Cultural Revolution under Mao, right?
[2:36:12.220 --> 2:36:16.220]  So they want to make everybody wear little green jackets
[2:36:16.220 --> 2:36:19.220]  and carry a little book from the Federal Reserve Bank
[2:36:19.220 --> 2:36:22.220]  talking about how great the interest rate policy is.
[2:36:22.220 --> 2:36:24.220]  So it's the Cultural Revolution of America.
[2:36:24.220 --> 2:36:28.220]  This is what happens when you let the left take control
[2:36:28.220 --> 2:36:30.220]  and you destroy the free market.
[2:36:30.220 --> 2:36:31.220]  And that's what that's all about.
[2:36:31.220 --> 2:36:32.220]  And that's what's happening right now.
[2:36:32.220 --> 2:36:36.220]  So I don't think there's anything good going to come out of it
[2:36:36.220 --> 2:36:38.220]  by the cowtowing to the mob.
[2:36:38.220 --> 2:36:40.220]  And then they're going to blame the free market,
[2:36:40.220 --> 2:36:42.220]  which this isn't. This is a crony capitalist market.
[2:36:42.220 --> 2:36:45.220]  And then the very group that steals the world through this fraud
[2:36:45.220 --> 2:36:47.220]  is going to use that as the pretext
[2:36:47.220 --> 2:36:50.220]  to then set up their true economic dictatorship.
[2:36:50.220 --> 2:36:53.220]  They already have an economic dictatorship.
[2:36:53.220 --> 2:36:55.220]  This is just the icing on the cake.
[2:36:55.220 --> 2:36:57.220]  And again, just to return to Bitcoin.
[2:36:57.220 --> 2:37:01.220]  I mean, Bitcoin is the escape hatch as Christine Lagarde called it.
[2:37:01.220 --> 2:37:03.220]  It's the only way out of this.
[2:37:03.220 --> 2:37:05.220]  And countries like El Salvador are approving that.
[2:37:05.220 --> 2:37:09.220]  But we are already in the monetary dictatorship.
[2:37:09.220 --> 2:37:12.220]  We already suffer financial terrorism and arsonists.
[2:37:12.220 --> 2:37:16.220]  That's the currently, that's why so many people in America are suffering
[2:37:16.220 --> 2:37:19.220]  is because they are being victimized by financial arsonists.
[2:37:19.220 --> 2:37:21.220]  No, wait, the megaman card's the problem.
[2:37:21.220 --> 2:37:23.220]  I thought white supremacists were the problem.
[2:37:23.220 --> 2:37:26.220]  No, that's a narrative that's put out there
[2:37:26.220 --> 2:37:30.220]  to try to eliminate this whole vestige
[2:37:30.220 --> 2:37:33.220]  of a free market capitalist society where it's a meritocracy,
[2:37:33.220 --> 2:37:36.220]  where there's an initiative
[2:37:36.220 --> 2:37:39.220]  and there's entrepreneurialism.
[2:37:39.220 --> 2:37:41.220]  That's got to be gotten rid of.
[2:37:41.220 --> 2:37:45.220]  Instead, there's a Federal Reserve Bank that issues free money
[2:37:45.220 --> 2:37:47.220]  and the fact that prices are skyrocketing
[2:37:47.220 --> 2:37:49.220]  and your quality of life is crashing.
[2:37:49.220 --> 2:37:51.220]  You should be feeling good about that.
[2:37:51.220 --> 2:37:53.220]  Those anti-white supremacists, yeah, I'm still there.
[2:37:53.220 --> 2:37:54.220]  In the last 16 months,

[2:39:58.220 --> 2:39:59.220]  Hey, Alex.
[2:39:59.220 --> 2:40:00.220]  Welcome.
[2:40:00.220 --> 2:40:01.220]  I would like to say first off,
[2:40:01.220 --> 2:40:02.220]  thanks for being the voice of reason
[2:40:02.220 --> 2:40:04.220]  and amongst all this stupidity.
[2:40:04.220 --> 2:40:05.220]  Wanted to warn people,
[2:40:05.220 --> 2:40:07.220]  I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year.
[2:40:07.220 --> 2:40:08.220]  Okay.
[2:40:08.220 --> 2:40:09.220]  I'm a double amputee
[2:40:09.220 --> 2:40:12.220]  and I have bacteria infection on my lung
[2:40:12.220 --> 2:40:14.220]  that'll never go away.
[2:40:14.220 --> 2:40:16.220]  Living defense saved my life.
[2:40:16.220 --> 2:40:18.220]  They had me on antibiotics for two years
[2:40:18.220 --> 2:40:20.220]  that almost killed me.
[2:40:20.220 --> 2:40:22.220]  Living defense brought me back.
[2:40:22.220 --> 2:40:24.220]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible,
[2:40:24.220 --> 2:40:26.220]  Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[2:40:26.220 --> 2:40:29.220]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine.
[2:40:29.220 --> 2:40:32.220]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted
[2:40:32.220 --> 2:40:35.220]  and shall kill you and you shall be hated
[2:40:35.220 --> 2:40:38.220]  of all nations for my name's sake.
[2:40:38.220 --> 2:40:40.220]  And then shall many be offended
[2:40:40.220 --> 2:40:42.220]  and shall betray one another
[2:40:42.220 --> 2:40:44.220]  and shall hate one another.
[2:40:44.220 --> 2:40:45.220]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[2:40:45.220 --> 2:40:47.220]  And that's because God's name
[2:40:47.220 --> 2:40:48.220]  is on the founding of this country
[2:40:48.220 --> 2:40:49.220]  no matter what they say,
[2:40:49.220 --> 2:40:51.220]  and that's why the enemy hates it,
[2:40:51.220 --> 2:40:54.220]  because God created this country.
[2:40:54.220 --> 2:40:56.220]  Scientists agree,
[2:40:56.220 --> 2:40:59.220]  magnesium is the most important cofactor
[2:40:59.220 --> 2:41:01.220]  in the body, regulating and controlling
[2:41:01.220 --> 2:41:03.220]  hundreds of pathways.
[2:41:03.220 --> 2:41:06.220]  Magnesium is required for your body
[2:41:06.220 --> 2:41:07.220]  to do the following.
[2:41:07.220 --> 2:41:09.220]  Helps convert food into energy.
[2:41:09.220 --> 2:41:12.220]  Helps with muscle contraction function.
[2:41:12.220 --> 2:41:14.220]  Helps regulate the nervous system.
[2:41:14.220 --> 2:41:16.220]  Helps with protein building in the muscles
[2:41:16.220 --> 2:41:18.220]  and so much more.
[2:41:18.220 --> 2:41:21.220]  And now it's available in this concentrated form
[2:41:21.220 --> 2:41:24.220]  of ionized, fizzy magnesium.
[2:41:24.220 --> 2:41:25.220]  It tastes great.
[2:41:25.220 --> 2:41:26.220]  I take it in the morning.
[2:41:26.220 --> 2:41:27.220]  I take it in the evening.
[2:41:27.220 --> 2:41:30.220]  It is so essential in my life.
[2:41:30.220 --> 2:41:33.220]  And I hope all of you will check it out and try it.
[2:41:33.220 --> 2:41:36.220]  It's available at infowarstore.com right now.
[2:41:36.220 --> 2:41:38.220]  This is the best formula from our research
[2:41:38.220 --> 2:41:39.220]  you're going to find out there.
[2:41:39.220 --> 2:41:42.220]  So if you've already enjoyed other magnesium formulas,
[2:41:42.220 --> 2:41:44.220]  give this one a try.
[2:41:44.220 --> 2:41:45.220]  I think you're going to love it
[2:41:45.220 --> 2:41:46.220]  at the same time it funds the Info War,
[2:41:46.220 --> 2:41:48.220]  which is a true 360 win.
[2:41:48.220 --> 2:41:52.220]  Now exclusively available at infowarstore.com
[2:41:52.220 --> 2:41:54.220]  for only $19.95.

[2:42:11.220 --> 2:42:13.220]  We are on the march.
[2:42:13.220 --> 2:42:16.220]  The Empire is on the run.
[2:42:19.220 --> 2:42:21.220]  But now the Empire has struck back.
[2:42:21.220 --> 2:42:23.220]  Final segment with Max Kaiser.
[2:42:23.220 --> 2:42:25.220]  We might go five minutes next hour.
[2:42:25.220 --> 2:42:27.220]  But then we have Stu Peters taking over.
[2:42:27.220 --> 2:42:29.220]  Then the war room on shore at 3 p.m. central today.
[2:42:29.220 --> 2:42:31.220]  Your word of mouth is victory.
[2:42:31.220 --> 2:42:32.220]  It is key to the whole fight.

[2:43:11.220 --> 2:43:13.220]  This is the system you want.

[2:43:21.220 --> 2:43:23.220]  InfoWarsPhone.com.
[2:43:23.220 --> 2:43:25.220]  InfoWarsPhone.com.
[2:43:25.220 --> 2:43:27.220]  With all the things going on, you need this.
[2:43:27.220 --> 2:43:29.220]  And I wouldn't just have it as an emergency backup.
[2:43:29.220 --> 2:43:30.220]  I'd start using it.
[2:43:30.220 --> 2:43:32.220]  I'd start using them to just let you think about
[2:43:32.220 --> 2:43:34.220]  how much your regular cell phones would be in track.
[2:43:34.220 --> 2:43:36.220]  941-955-1020.
[2:43:36.220 --> 2:43:38.220]  941-955-1020.
[2:43:38.220 --> 2:43:41.220]  Ask for the Alex Jones Special
[2:43:41.220 --> 2:43:44.220]  at infowarsphone.com.
[2:43:44.220 --> 2:43:47.220]  And it's our sponsors that make it all possible.
[2:43:47.220 --> 2:43:49.220]  Now, you're not really a sponsor, Max Tausser,
[2:43:49.220 --> 2:43:52.220]  but we love you and you come on, you do a lot of stuff,
[2:43:52.220 --> 2:43:54.220]  and I've wanted you to be in studio.
[2:43:54.220 --> 2:43:56.220]  But I guess over there on the east coast,
[2:43:56.220 --> 2:43:58.220]  you refuse to come out of there.
[2:43:58.220 --> 2:44:00.220]  But you are on the march,
[2:44:00.220 --> 2:44:02.220]  though you're a big global globetrotter,
[2:44:02.220 --> 2:44:04.220]  but you haven't been doing that much lately.
[2:44:04.220 --> 2:44:06.220]  You're coming to Austin, I'm told,
[2:44:06.220 --> 2:44:09.220]  to kick something off with your significant other,
[2:44:09.220 --> 2:44:12.220]  Stacy, in Texas very soon.
[2:44:12.220 --> 2:44:14.220]  And it's not very friendly towards Elon Musk.
[2:44:14.220 --> 2:44:16.220]  Tell us about it.
[2:44:16.220 --> 2:44:19.220]  Right, so we're having a big party at Spider House
[2:44:19.220 --> 2:44:21.220]  in Austin, Texas.
[2:44:21.220 --> 2:44:23.220]  And it's really a Bitcoin party.
[2:44:23.220 --> 2:44:26.220]  And we're kicking around Elon Musk and Mark Cuban
[2:44:26.220 --> 2:44:29.220]  and a lot of people who say stupid things about Bitcoin
[2:44:29.220 --> 2:44:31.220]  and a lot of fun.
[2:44:31.220 --> 2:44:33.220]  We're going to have a great barbecue there.
[2:44:33.220 --> 2:44:35.220]  I'd like to give two tickets away right now
[2:44:35.220 --> 2:44:37.220]  because you can arrange that on your end
[2:44:37.220 --> 2:44:39.220]  and figure out who those two listeners are going to be.
[2:44:39.220 --> 2:44:42.220]  But they're going for $150 a ticket right now.
[2:44:42.220 --> 2:44:45.220]  You can still have a few tickets left.
[2:44:45.220 --> 2:44:48.220]  If you go to Eventbrite and search this
[2:44:48.220 --> 2:44:51.220]  Elon Musk, Mark Cuban, or Max Kaiser,
[2:44:51.220 --> 2:44:54.220]  or go to my Twitter handle at Max Kaiser,
[2:44:54.220 --> 2:44:56.220]  you'll find links.
[2:44:56.220 --> 2:44:58.220]  And we've got a few tickets left,
[2:44:58.220 --> 2:45:00.220]  and we're going to have a couple hundred, 250 people there.
[2:45:00.220 --> 2:45:02.220]  Bitcoin magazines coming on as a media sponsor.
[2:45:02.220 --> 2:45:04.220]  They're going to be live streaming the event.
[2:45:04.220 --> 2:45:09.220]  I'm going to tell you, it's great you want to give tickets away,
[2:45:09.220 --> 2:45:11.220]  but it's almost sold out.
[2:45:11.220 --> 2:45:13.220]  You could have 5,000 people at this event.
[2:45:13.220 --> 2:45:15.220]  I mean, you were just at one in Miami that was totally jammed back.
[2:45:15.220 --> 2:45:19.220]  So your problem is you need to do more events, Max.
[2:45:19.220 --> 2:45:21.220]  Well, we're going to go on tour.
[2:45:21.220 --> 2:45:23.220]  So the idea here is to make it a little intimate.
[2:45:23.220 --> 2:45:25.220]  We're going to have a lot of the Bitcoin legends
[2:45:25.220 --> 2:45:26.220]  that live in Austin.
[2:45:26.220 --> 2:45:28.220]  Austin is a Bitcoin hotspot in the world.
[2:45:28.220 --> 2:45:31.220]  We're going to have a lot of those folks in the venue
[2:45:31.220 --> 2:45:33.220]  so people can rob elbows.
[2:45:33.220 --> 2:45:35.220]  It's like the Sundance Film Festival.
[2:45:35.220 --> 2:45:37.220]  If you've ever been there, you met, you know,
[2:45:37.220 --> 2:45:39.220]  kind of the major stars are walking around Main Street.
[2:45:39.220 --> 2:45:41.220]  Here we're going to have big, you know,
[2:45:41.220 --> 2:45:44.220]  legends in the Austin Bitcoin community are going to be right there.
[2:45:44.220 --> 2:45:47.220]  So people who come, they'll be rubbing elbows with these folks.
[2:45:47.220 --> 2:45:49.220]  It's going to be a huge success.
[2:45:49.220 --> 2:45:51.220]  People can find the dates on your Twitter.
[2:45:51.220 --> 2:45:54.220]  All right, Max Kaiser, what's the date you're coming to Austin again?
[2:45:54.220 --> 2:45:56.220]  The show is on July 8th.
[2:45:56.220 --> 2:45:58.220]  I'll be there two days before, two days after.
[2:45:58.220 --> 2:46:01.220]  If anybody needs me for anything, I'm available.
[2:46:01.220 --> 2:46:03.220]  That's good. So you're going to be in studio with us?
[2:46:03.220 --> 2:46:06.220]  Yes, I will be in the studio with you.
[2:46:06.220 --> 2:46:09.220]  We have to continue our Nerf gun war.
[2:46:09.220 --> 2:46:12.220]  I won the first battle, Alex Jones.
[2:46:12.220 --> 2:46:13.220]  I forgot about that.
[2:46:13.220 --> 2:46:16.220]  Pull up Max Kaiser, Alex Jones, Nerf guns.
[2:46:16.220 --> 2:46:17.220]  I think I won.
[2:46:17.220 --> 2:46:19.220]  But we'll see what happened.
[2:46:19.220 --> 2:46:21.220]  Hey, Max, getting serious the time we have left.
[2:46:21.220 --> 2:46:24.220]  I'm really concerned about the attorney general,
[2:46:24.220 --> 2:46:26.220]  the FBI director saying the greatest threat is conservatives,
[2:46:26.220 --> 2:46:28.220]  people that question elections.
[2:46:28.220 --> 2:46:29.220]  They want to get rid of due process,
[2:46:29.220 --> 2:46:31.220]  use the Patriot Act on members of Congress.
[2:46:31.220 --> 2:46:33.220]  I'm sure you've seen these clips.
[2:46:33.220 --> 2:46:36.220]  I mean, this is like an authoritarian nightmare right out of a movie.
[2:46:36.220 --> 2:46:38.220]  The old left would have opposed this.
[2:46:38.220 --> 2:46:41.220]  They are really spoiling to come after people,
[2:46:41.220 --> 2:46:43.220]  not just the January 6th folks.
[2:46:43.220 --> 2:46:44.220]  What do you think that's about?
[2:46:44.220 --> 2:46:47.220]  I'm really concerned about a false flag.
[2:46:47.220 --> 2:46:51.220]  Yeah, it is kind of a continuation of what we were just saying before the break,
[2:46:51.220 --> 2:46:55.220]  that you've got a cadre of money printers
[2:46:55.220 --> 2:46:57.220]  that understand that the way to enslave people
[2:46:57.220 --> 2:46:59.220]  is to flood them with fiat money.
[2:46:59.220 --> 2:47:02.220]  The way people get unhealthy is they eat fiat food.
[2:47:02.220 --> 2:47:04.220]  And, you know, your show has supplements
[2:47:04.220 --> 2:47:06.220]  and you're trying to fight the fiat food.
[2:47:06.220 --> 2:47:09.220]  The way the economy gets sick is it's flooded with fiat money.
[2:47:09.220 --> 2:47:13.220]  And the US dollar is losing purchasing power every single day.
[2:47:13.220 --> 2:47:15.220]  And people start blaming themselves like,
[2:47:15.220 --> 2:47:17.220]  why is my money losing purchasing power?
[2:47:17.220 --> 2:47:19.220]  They don't really want to take on board.
[2:47:19.220 --> 2:47:21.220]  It's because of a concerted effort by their own government
[2:47:21.220 --> 2:47:23.220]  to destroy the underlying economy
[2:47:23.220 --> 2:47:26.220]  so that they can make a few of their friends absolutely rich.
[2:47:26.220 --> 2:47:28.220]  And the same thing is happening now
[2:47:28.220 --> 2:47:31.220]  that democratically controlled Washington D.C.
[2:47:31.220 --> 2:47:33.220]  They are in the pocket of Wall Street.
[2:47:33.220 --> 2:47:35.220]  The Clintons and all those folks.
[2:47:35.220 --> 2:47:39.220]  And, you know, Joe Biden came out of the credit card lobbying industry.
[2:47:39.220 --> 2:47:42.220]  He's been the credit card lobbyist in Washington for decades.
[2:47:42.220 --> 2:47:44.220]  That's their constituency.
[2:47:44.220 --> 2:47:45.220]  That's who they work for.
[2:47:45.220 --> 2:47:47.220]  And they want to continue money printing
[2:47:47.220 --> 2:47:50.220]  and putting people into as much debt as they possibly can
[2:47:50.220 --> 2:47:52.220]  because you're becoming debt slave.
[2:47:52.220 --> 2:47:54.220]  That's their agenda.
[2:47:54.220 --> 2:47:56.220]  And then once you become a debt slave,
[2:47:56.220 --> 2:47:58.220]  you're going to be prone to anxiety attacks
[2:47:58.220 --> 2:48:00.220]  and now you're going to take a lot of pharmaceutical...
[2:48:00.220 --> 2:48:01.220]  Let me ask you this.
[2:48:01.220 --> 2:48:03.220]  What do you think the time frame is on this?
[2:48:03.220 --> 2:48:05.220]  I mean, this is going to get very destructive worldwide.
[2:48:05.220 --> 2:48:08.220]  What countries do you think have better currencies right now?
[2:48:08.220 --> 2:48:10.220]  I know you're all about Bitcoin. I get that.
[2:48:10.220 --> 2:48:12.220]  But I'm saying, the old dinosaur currencies,
[2:48:12.220 --> 2:48:15.220]  which one's going to be the first to bite the dust?
[2:48:17.220 --> 2:48:20.220]  They're all hyper-inflating right now.
[2:48:20.220 --> 2:48:21.220]  You know, all the time.
[2:48:21.220 --> 2:48:24.220]  You see, in some of these countries,
[2:48:24.220 --> 2:48:26.220]  the currency is absolutely collapsing.
[2:48:26.220 --> 2:48:30.220]  Aside from El Salvador now going on to a Bitcoin standard,
[2:48:30.220 --> 2:48:34.220]  we have Paraguay and Guatemala are now making moves
[2:48:34.220 --> 2:48:37.220]  to make Bitcoin legal tender in those countries.
[2:48:37.220 --> 2:48:40.220]  What's happening in Latin America, Central America, Alex,
[2:48:40.220 --> 2:48:43.220]  is the revolution we've been talking about for 10 years.
[2:48:43.220 --> 2:48:47.220]  And that's the most exciting thing in the world today
[2:48:47.220 --> 2:48:50.220]  in terms of pushing back against the globalists.
[2:48:50.220 --> 2:48:52.220]  The central bankers, the IMF, the World Bank,
[2:48:52.220 --> 2:48:54.220]  Jamie Dimon, and the Wall Street banks.
[2:48:54.220 --> 2:48:56.220]  It's happening right there.
[2:48:56.220 --> 2:48:59.220]  All credit goes to my friend, Jack Mollers,
[2:48:59.220 --> 2:49:03.220]  who was there for months putting in the in-strike system,
[2:49:03.220 --> 2:49:06.220]  which gives you instant payments on your phone
[2:49:06.220 --> 2:49:09.220]  and great access to Bitcoin.
[2:49:09.220 --> 2:49:11.220]  And it's the trending that's happening.
[2:49:11.220 --> 2:49:12.220]  Absolutely. But just so you know,
[2:49:12.220 --> 2:49:14.220]  I'm no fan of GCPing, obviously,
[2:49:14.220 --> 2:49:16.220]  but they came out last week during G7 and said,
[2:49:16.220 --> 2:49:18.220]  you globalists don't run anything anymore.
[2:49:18.220 --> 2:49:20.220]  We're not cutting carbon.
[2:49:20.220 --> 2:49:22.220]  We're going to have three kids instead of one,
[2:49:22.220 --> 2:49:23.220]  and screw you.
[2:49:23.220 --> 2:49:25.220]  You don't run the New World Order anymore.
[2:49:25.220 --> 2:49:26.220]  Nobody does.
[2:49:26.220 --> 2:49:27.220]  They said nobody runs it.
[2:49:27.220 --> 2:49:29.220]  And there's got to be a moment where everybody realizes
[2:49:29.220 --> 2:49:31.220]  the whole kiss of your era is over.
[2:49:31.220 --> 2:49:33.220]  What comes out of that is everybody just stops
[2:49:33.220 --> 2:49:35.220]  following what the New World Order says
[2:49:35.220 --> 2:49:38.220]  with the FBI pointing a gun at your head.
[2:49:38.220 --> 2:49:40.220]  Right. And not to belabor this point,
[2:49:40.220 --> 2:49:42.220]  but the thing about Bitcoin, Alex,
[2:49:42.220 --> 2:49:46.220]  is that there is no central authority running the protocol.
[2:49:46.220 --> 2:49:48.220]  It's totally essential.
[2:49:48.220 --> 2:49:50.220]  I know you told us a year ago, six months ago, two months ago,
[2:49:50.220 --> 2:49:51.220]  countries are adopting it.
[2:49:51.220 --> 2:49:52.220]  Then others will.
[2:49:52.220 --> 2:49:53.220]  It'll cause a stampede.
[2:49:53.220 --> 2:49:55.220]  And the hash wars will start.
[2:49:55.220 --> 2:49:56.220]  I got that.
[2:49:56.220 --> 2:49:57.220]  Let's get to China.
[2:49:57.220 --> 2:49:59.220]  Okay, so China is a centralized,
[2:49:59.220 --> 2:50:02.220]  top-down authoritarian country
[2:50:02.220 --> 2:50:04.220]  that's going to lose against Bitcoin.
[2:50:04.220 --> 2:50:05.220]  It's only in question time
[2:50:05.220 --> 2:50:08.220]  when they give up the ghost and succumb to Bitcoin.
[2:50:08.220 --> 2:50:09.220]  But I agree.
[2:50:09.220 --> 2:50:10.220]  But in between them,
[2:50:10.220 --> 2:50:11.220]  they're telling the globalists,
[2:50:11.220 --> 2:50:12.220]  put them in power, you screw off.
[2:50:12.220 --> 2:50:13.220]  So how does that?
[2:50:13.220 --> 2:50:15.220]  That's going to be a big deal.
[2:50:15.220 --> 2:50:18.220]  There's a lot of belligerence happening
[2:50:18.220 --> 2:50:21.220]  between China and everybody else,
[2:50:21.220 --> 2:50:24.220]  especially over Hong Kong and especially over Taiwan.
[2:50:24.220 --> 2:50:27.220]  So it looks like we're on, as many have said,
[2:50:27.220 --> 2:50:31.220]  you go from currency war to trade war to a hot war,
[2:50:31.220 --> 2:50:33.220]  and now we're entering that hot war era.
[2:50:33.220 --> 2:50:35.220]  So there is a existential crisis.
[2:50:35.220 --> 2:50:37.220]  We are on the footstep, doorstep.
[2:50:37.220 --> 2:50:38.220]  Exactly.
[2:50:38.220 --> 2:50:40.220]  So why is it the left trying to organize America
[2:50:40.220 --> 2:50:41.220]  into a cohesive force
[2:50:41.220 --> 2:50:43.220]  if we're about to go into a hot war with China?
[2:50:43.220 --> 2:50:44.220]  Instead, they're still trying to fight the old war
[2:50:44.220 --> 2:50:46.220]  to dominate people culturally
[2:50:46.220 --> 2:50:49.220]  when that makes China have no respect for us.
[2:50:49.220 --> 2:50:51.220]  Because the information in America,
[2:50:51.220 --> 2:50:52.220]  and I don't, you know,
[2:50:52.220 --> 2:50:55.220]  people who watch info wars should understand
[2:50:55.220 --> 2:50:57.220]  that the information and news in America
[2:50:57.220 --> 2:51:01.220]  is completely dictated to by a corporate agenda.
[2:51:01.220 --> 2:51:03.220]  It has absolutely nothing to do
[2:51:03.220 --> 2:51:05.220]  with any underlying facts or truths.
[2:51:05.220 --> 2:51:07.220]  And the corporate agenda is hiding behind
[2:51:07.220 --> 2:51:09.220]  black people and poor people while it lutes the world.
[2:51:09.220 --> 2:51:12.220]  No, no, the corporate agenda is to send bombs
[2:51:12.220 --> 2:51:15.220]  because war is incredibly profitable.
[2:51:15.220 --> 2:51:19.220]  And those few that make out with war are loving war.
[2:51:19.220 --> 2:51:21.220]  And it's like you said, suicide bankers,
[2:51:21.220 --> 2:51:23.220]  like you knew people in the World Trade Center
[2:51:23.220 --> 2:51:27.220]  who stayed trading to make extra money till they died.
[2:51:27.220 --> 2:51:28.220]  That's right.
[2:51:28.220 --> 2:51:29.220]  That's right.
[2:51:29.220 --> 2:51:31.220]  They were trading airline option puts
[2:51:31.220 --> 2:51:34.220]  all the way until the building around them collapsed.
[2:51:34.220 --> 2:51:37.220]  And that was, that's a suicide banker.
[2:51:37.220 --> 2:51:40.220]  And that's the same mentality of Jamie Dimon today,
[2:51:40.220 --> 2:51:42.220]  who is out there doing the same thing,
[2:51:42.220 --> 2:51:44.220]  but on a subtler basis with his derivatives
[2:51:44.220 --> 2:51:47.220]  and all of his lobbying for rights and his...
[2:51:47.220 --> 2:51:49.220]  So he'll fund the nuclear missiles that blow the planet up,
[2:51:49.220 --> 2:51:53.220]  but when the planet blows up, he'll be the richest man.
[2:51:53.220 --> 2:51:57.220]  It's like a Outer Limits episode, right?
[2:51:57.220 --> 2:52:00.220]  It makes no sense from a humanitarian point of view,
[2:52:00.220 --> 2:52:03.220]  but for your psychotic, serial terrorist,
[2:52:03.220 --> 2:52:06.220]  financial terrorist like Wall Street Banker,
[2:52:06.220 --> 2:52:08.220]  in your mind, you know, it makes sense.
[2:52:08.220 --> 2:52:10.220]  But these people are psychotic, Alex.
[2:52:10.220 --> 2:52:11.220]  That's the problem.
[2:52:11.220 --> 2:52:13.220]  They are psychotic and they run big banks.
[2:52:13.220 --> 2:52:14.220]  All right.
[2:52:14.220 --> 2:52:16.220]  Five more minutes with Max Kaiser,
[2:52:16.220 --> 2:52:19.220]  and then we've got our guest host taking over to Peters.
[2:52:19.220 --> 2:52:20.220]  Always does an amazing job.
[2:52:20.220 --> 2:52:22.220]  And then the War Room, Owen Schreuer,
[2:52:22.220 --> 2:52:23.220]  3 to 6 p.m.
[2:52:23.220 --> 2:52:25.220]  And I want to thank listeners for promoting
[2:52:25.220 --> 2:52:27.220]  the American Journal with Harrison Smith
[2:52:27.220 --> 2:52:28.220]  and the War Room.
[2:52:28.220 --> 2:52:29.220]  They're really exploding now.
[2:52:29.220 --> 2:52:30.220]  And that's great.
[2:52:30.220 --> 2:52:32.220]  Because folks work hard on those shows
[2:52:32.220 --> 2:52:33.220]  to bring you hard-earning information.
[2:52:33.220 --> 2:52:35.220]  So, hey, you may already know all this stuff.
[2:52:35.220 --> 2:52:36.220]  Probably no more than I do.
[2:52:36.220 --> 2:52:37.220]  It doesn't matter.
[2:52:37.220 --> 2:52:39.220]  There are articles and videos about the shows,
[2:52:39.220 --> 2:52:41.220]  but that's how we move the ball forward.
[2:52:41.220 --> 2:52:43.220]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[2:52:43.220 --> 2:52:46.220]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about
[2:52:46.220 --> 2:52:50.220]  for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[2:52:50.220 --> 2:52:52.220]  The globalists are out in the open
[2:52:52.220 --> 2:52:55.220]  with their planetary depopulation takeover,
[2:52:55.220 --> 2:52:56.220]  their robot takeover.
[2:52:56.220 --> 2:52:58.220]  But the good news is we've been working
[2:52:58.220 --> 2:52:59.220]  and you've been working,
[2:52:59.220 --> 2:53:01.220]  and others have been working across the planet for decades
[2:53:01.220 --> 2:53:04.220]  to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[2:53:04.220 --> 2:53:05.220]  Humanity is strong.
[2:53:05.220 --> 2:53:06.220]  We're incredible.
[2:53:06.220 --> 2:53:08.220]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening,
[2:53:08.220 --> 2:53:10.220]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[2:53:10.220 --> 2:53:12.220]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[2:53:12.220 --> 2:53:15.220]  So, prayer is essential, research is essential,
[2:53:15.220 --> 2:53:16.220]  getting prepared is essential,
[2:53:16.220 --> 2:53:18.220]  and warning others is absolutely essential.
[2:53:18.220 --> 2:53:21.220]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars
[2:53:21.220 --> 2:53:24.220]  by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential
[2:53:24.220 --> 2:53:26.220]  because they're great products for you and your family,
[2:53:26.220 --> 2:53:28.220]  and they're also funding our operation.
[2:53:28.220 --> 2:53:30.220]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:53:30.220 --> 2:53:33.220]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[2:53:33.220 --> 2:53:35.220]  A lot of our products have been sold out
[2:53:35.220 --> 2:53:37.220]  because the supply chain breakdowns are back in,
[2:53:37.220 --> 2:53:39.220]  like bodies, mazobeats, and others.
[2:53:39.220 --> 2:53:41.220]  So, get them today at InfoWarsStore.com,
[2:53:41.220 --> 2:53:43.220]  and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[2:53:46.220 --> 2:53:49.220]  What are champions made of?
[2:53:49.220 --> 2:53:51.220]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:53:57.220 --> 2:53:59.220]  Triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:53:59.220 --> 2:54:01.220]  Triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:54:01.220 --> 2:54:03.220]  Triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:54:03.220 --> 2:54:05.220]  Triple eight, two five, three, one, three, nine.
[2:54:05.220 --> 2:54:07.220]  Triple eight, two five, three, one, three, nine.
[2:54:07.220 --> 2:54:09.220]  Triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:54:09.220 --> 2:54:11.220]  It's the InfoWars Story Footline!
[2:54:11.220 --> 2:54:13.220]  Triple eight, two five, three, one, three, nine.

[2:54:15.220 --> 2:54:17.220]  Triple eight, two five, three, one, three, nine.

[2:54:19.220 --> 2:54:21.220]  Triple eight, two five, three, one, three, nine.

[2:54:27.220 --> 2:54:29.220]  Triple eight, two five, three, one, three, nine.
[2:54:29.220 --> 2:54:31.220]  It's the InfoWars Story Footline!
[2:54:31.220 --> 2:54:35.980]  To the late 2139, to the late 2139, to the late 2139 is in,
[2:54:35.980 --> 2:54:37.460]  pouring store, out the line.
[2:54:37.460 --> 2:54:40.820]  To the late 2139, to the late 2139, to the late 2139,
[2:54:40.820 --> 2:54:44.440]  to the late 2139, that's info.store.com.
[2:54:47.540 --> 2:54:50.200]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[2:54:50.200 --> 2:55:06.200]  El Salvador. He's been saying it for years as soon as countries start adopting Bitcoin
[2:55:06.200 --> 2:55:11.000]  as legal tender. He believes it can cause a chain reaction. That chain reaction has
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:14.520]  now begun. Max Kaiser, finish up your point on that
[2:55:14.520 --> 2:55:22.520]  please. Right, so we talked about it as hash war. Basically countries competing
[2:55:22.520 --> 2:55:25.960]  with each other. And this was the answer to when people would come up and say,
[2:55:25.960 --> 2:55:29.960]  hey, what if countries outlaw Bitcoin? Well, there's two answers. Number one is
[2:55:29.960 --> 2:55:34.840]  it's impossible to outlaw Bitcoin, just like it's impossible to outlaw PDP file sharing.
[2:55:34.840 --> 2:55:40.600]  Just ask Hollywood or the recording industry about that. You cannot shut down a file sharing
[2:55:40.600 --> 2:55:47.560]  network online. So it's impossible. And Bitcoin is a PDP, essentially currency.
[2:55:47.560 --> 2:55:52.440]  The second answer is that the more likely scenario is that countries like here we have El Salvador
[2:55:52.440 --> 2:55:57.400]  realize, you know what? We can have a banking system that's outside of the current banking
[2:55:57.400 --> 2:56:02.280]  system and outside of any nation state with hard money where purchasing power is going to increase.
[2:56:02.280 --> 2:56:05.880]  So we're going to adopt Bitcoin. We're going to mine Bitcoin. We're going to use volcano energy,
[2:56:05.880 --> 2:56:13.240]  geothermal energy to mine Bitcoin. Now Paraguay and Guatemala have weighed in and said we're now
[2:56:13.240 --> 2:56:19.240]  introducing legislation to also make Bitcoin legal tender in these countries. Argentina
[2:56:19.240 --> 2:56:24.680]  is talking about this. I would imagine that we won't be long before we hear about Mexico.
[2:56:24.680 --> 2:56:29.400]  So the entire Latin American, South American part of this hemisphere could be on a Bitcoin
[2:56:29.400 --> 2:56:33.960]  standard, which is going to force a chain reaction in Europe, Asia, all over the world,
[2:56:33.960 --> 2:56:38.840]  going to go to a Bitcoin standard. This is the death kneel for the IMF, the World Bank, JP
[2:56:38.840 --> 2:56:44.360]  Morgan, Wall Street Banks, the globalists, the war machine, the haters, the killers,
[2:56:44.360 --> 2:56:49.960]  the destroyers are all going to be wiped out by the love explosion that is Bitcoin.
[2:56:51.640 --> 2:56:55.240]  Now they've really been trying to push Bitcoin down. I know you've been mad at Elon Musk.
[2:56:55.960 --> 2:56:59.720]  He seems to be kind of manipulating the market right now. If you guys can put up the last month
[2:56:59.720 --> 2:57:02.840]  of Bitcoin, it went down quite a bit. Now it's going back up. What's happening?
[2:57:02.840 --> 2:57:11.240]  Well, it's been in this for 10 years, and we've had 15 pullbacks in those 10 years,
[2:57:11.240 --> 2:57:17.000]  and this is an average pullback. It's about the ninth largest pullback in the last 10 years or so.
[2:57:17.960 --> 2:57:22.680]  What more importantly, underlying fundamentals in terms of corporations like micro strategy
[2:57:22.680 --> 2:57:26.520]  is adding billions to their balance sheet. El Salvador is obviously getting this game.
[2:57:26.520 --> 2:57:30.360]  Federal banks getting involved. Government's getting involved compared to where Bitcoin was
[2:57:30.360 --> 2:57:34.040]  even a year ago. This seems like a capitulation as I've called it to Bitcoin.
[2:57:35.320 --> 2:57:42.120]  It is. You get the price of Bitcoin you deserve. Elon Musk, he has a big voice,
[2:57:42.120 --> 2:57:47.240]  and he has a lot of money, and he's tweeting about Bitcoin. But I used to do that. When I
[2:57:47.240 --> 2:57:54.760]  tweeted about Bitcoin in 2011, 2012, and 2013, the price would move 50% a day. So Elon Musk is
[2:57:54.760 --> 2:58:01.160]  doing a Max Kaiser six, seven years later. Most everything anyone does in Bitcoin, whether it's
[2:58:01.160 --> 2:58:05.560]  the insults that they use to criticize it or the things they'd like to say that they like about it,
[2:58:05.560 --> 2:58:10.280]  if you go back to my shows from eight, nine, 10 years ago. But I'm not like Peter Schiff,
[2:58:10.280 --> 2:58:14.280]  who I think is a good guy, but he could have done it and missed the boat. I missed the boat,
[2:58:14.280 --> 2:58:22.440]  I've been, I was wrong. So I learned from myself. Well, Peter Schiff has a very hard
[2:58:22.440 --> 2:58:27.960]  in the stance. Whereas Spencer Schiff, his son, who's a friend of mine, he is all about Bitcoin,
[2:58:27.960 --> 2:58:32.120]  loves Bitcoin. He's been buying Bitcoin, and he'll probably be in the Austin event
[2:58:32.120 --> 2:58:36.760]  coming up on July 8th at Spider House in Austin. Tickets available, search online,
[2:58:36.760 --> 2:58:41.080]  and you were giving two away on your show, Alex. I don't know how you're going to do that, but
[2:58:41.080 --> 2:58:45.160]  two lucky listeners are going to get tickets to the event, Alex. Well, it looks like two of the
[2:58:45.160 --> 2:58:49.160]  crew got a ticket. I don't know how I'm supposed to get, I love my listeners, but how am I supposed
[2:58:49.160 --> 2:58:54.280]  to give this ticket away? I love how you give me the responsibility. How about you just give me
[2:58:54.280 --> 2:59:01.640]  that 10,000 Bitcoin? Tell you what, if you give me 10,000 Bitcoin like you tried, I promise I
[2:59:01.640 --> 2:59:08.440]  will distribute it 80% of it to the listeners. But it's, it's in a safe place, Alex. And I don't
[2:59:08.440 --> 2:59:14.520]  want to burden you with keeping track of it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I apologize for 10 years
[2:59:14.520 --> 2:59:21.480]  ago. Now I will take the 10, I will take 1,000 Bitcoin. Just consider it as a friendly gesture
[2:59:21.480 --> 2:59:28.360]  on my behalf to custodian and to safeguard those coins, Alex. And we'll revisit this at a time when
[2:59:28.360 --> 2:59:33.800]  I feel a year's really mature enough to handle this type of responsibility, because it is a
[2:59:33.800 --> 2:59:39.400]  whopping big responsibility of about $350 billion worth of Bitcoin. Well, if I haven't
[2:59:39.400 --> 2:59:43.160]  proven out the responsibility now, I want to fund the operation with a small percentage of it,
[2:59:43.160 --> 2:59:48.360]  and I will promote Bitcoin and the rest. You can give the Bitcoin to me. Thank you, Max. Let's talk
[2:59:48.360 --> 2:59:53.640]  about this when I'm... All right, thank you, Max. Yes, sir. We're going to fight part two. People pat me
[2:59:53.640 --> 2:59:57.720]  on the back all the time, and I really, really appreciate it. But I want you to understand
[2:59:57.720 --> 3:00:03.160]  something. Don't put the horse in front of the cart here. Don't put the wagon in front.
[3:00:04.280 --> 3:00:08.200]  Fight's tearing. That also makes your life better. A lot of people are counting on enforcement to
[3:00:08.200 --> 3:00:12.840]  stay on the air, so I'm counting on you to keep us on the air. We're going to defeat the globalists,
[3:00:12.840 --> 3:00:16.360]  but it's not going to happen easy. When you've got on our side, we've got to take action.

[3:00:55.560 --> 3:01:01.800]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[3:01:09.560 --> 3:01:14.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. My name is Stu Peters. You can find me at stupeters.tv.
[3:01:15.880 --> 3:01:23.880]  Gone last week. I was in Texas, veterans, and celebrity softball classic. What an incredible
[3:01:23.880 --> 3:01:28.680]  time that was. I did miss being here, though, with you guys. There's so much to cover. I'm looking
[3:01:28.680 --> 3:01:34.360]  at breaking news right now. We're trying to get Dr. Gene Ruby on the line to talk about some of this,
[3:01:34.360 --> 3:01:41.720]  but there are two companies that are so eerily connected, as we have now discovered that every
[3:01:41.720 --> 3:01:48.360]  system at the disposal of these globalists is being weaponized against you, and we're discovering
[3:01:48.360 --> 3:01:52.840]  now we're finding out the complexity of the relationships, not only between individuals,
[3:01:52.840 --> 3:01:58.840]  not between Fauci and Gates, because we have those suspicions, and we're trying to get it
[3:01:58.840 --> 3:02:02.040]  out to the masses right now. We need your help with all of that, but also the collusion and
[3:02:02.040 --> 3:02:07.480]  concerted efforts from allied countries that we have now been able to clearly identify as adversaries
[3:02:07.480 --> 3:02:11.800]  of the United States, attackers of freedom, enemies of liberty, destroyers of justice,
[3:02:11.800 --> 3:02:14.920]  they're murderers, they're criminals, they're pedophiles, they're drug and human trafficking
[3:02:14.920 --> 3:02:19.880]  terrorists, and they're not living in caves in Afghanistan or beheading people in the desert
[3:02:19.880 --> 3:02:26.280]  on YouTube videos. They're living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. They're in the empty city of Washington,
[3:02:26.280 --> 3:02:31.400]  D.C. It's eerie, it's a ghost town, but we're getting now, as we start to look into this,
[3:02:31.400 --> 3:02:37.240]  it's the responsibility of people like myself, and just because of the curious nature of my
[3:02:37.240 --> 3:02:41.480]  investigative background, I always like to try to figure things out, and Dr. Gene Ruby,
[3:02:41.480 --> 3:02:46.120]  I've got to give her all of the credit, because as an international health economist, as somebody
[3:02:46.120 --> 3:02:52.840]  with 20 years of pharmaceutical research experience, she's not only just researching now the pharmaceuticals
[3:02:52.840 --> 3:02:58.920]  themselves, but why they are the way that they are, why they're being hidden, why they're being
[3:02:58.920 --> 3:03:03.560]  pushed so much. I mean, the curiosity amongst these doctors that are speaking out, the brave ones
[3:03:03.560 --> 3:03:08.680]  that we're hearing about, Dr. Carrie Maday, that's been on this program multiple times. I had her
[3:03:08.680 --> 3:03:15.000]  on the Stu Peters show just recently, you know, Dr. Tenpenny, Dr. Simone Gold, Dr. Peter McCullough,
[3:03:15.000 --> 3:03:19.160]  I mean, the names that you are familiar with, and now Dr. Gene Ruby emerging on the scene as
[3:03:19.160 --> 3:03:24.680]  somebody who is responsibly opining on all of these things, and we're going to have her on here in
[3:03:24.680 --> 3:03:30.200]  just a moment to talk about the relationship of two companies that are extremely close to one
[3:03:30.200 --> 3:03:36.200]  another, and it's going to shock you. We've been talking about this magnetism. It's not a phenomenon,
[3:03:36.200 --> 3:03:41.000]  it's not a conspiracy. Thousands of people are literally sticking stuff to their face,
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:46.440]  they're sticking stuff to their arms. Now we're seeing all the videos of magnetic meat. This
[3:03:46.440 --> 3:03:49.720]  isn't a conspiracy. The media wants you to believe that it is. You're going to get banned from
[3:03:49.720 --> 3:03:55.800]  everywhere. If you mention it, Instagram, Facebook, all the CCP communists owned and propagandized
[3:03:56.680 --> 3:04:00.280]  media, social media outlets, you're going to be thrown off of there obviously immediately. If
[3:04:00.280 --> 3:04:04.760]  you mentioned magnetism, but there's a certain company, and I'm hearing Dr. Gene Ruby, we've
[3:04:04.760 --> 3:04:08.840]  got a whole other so we can bring her on right now. There are two companies, thank you Dr.
[3:04:08.840 --> 3:04:14.280]  Gene for being here. We really appreciate it. There's a company called Concealer Cell, and then
[3:04:14.280 --> 3:04:20.920]  there is, they're meddling in this technology that's behind this magnetofection. The magnetofection
[3:04:20.920 --> 3:04:28.360]  that you have been breaking is what drives the MRNA through the body more rapidly. It's an easier
[3:04:28.360 --> 3:04:33.720]  form or more aggressive form of transmission through the body, which is why it's not localized to the
[3:04:33.720 --> 3:04:38.040]  arm anymore, but now we're finding people with these diagnoses like Guillain-Barre and other
[3:04:38.040 --> 3:04:41.960]  things, which we're going to be breaking here shortly as well. I mean, all this stuff is just
[3:04:41.960 --> 3:04:47.400]  coming across here, but they have an interesting relationship with another company of interest
[3:04:47.400 --> 3:04:51.480]  throughout this whole pandemic. You uncovered this whole thing, called me from the airport.
[3:04:52.200 --> 3:04:55.800]  I want you to tell the Alex Jones listeners all about this. Folks, pay attention to this, because
[3:04:55.800 --> 3:05:01.160]  this, you just, you have to take a look at the complexity of these relationships to really
[3:05:01.160 --> 3:05:08.280]  understand how deep the deep state is, how big the globalist grip is on this world. Dr. Jane.
[3:05:09.480 --> 3:05:14.360]  Yeah, thanks, Stu. Let me start a little bit from the beginning. When all of those people
[3:05:14.360 --> 3:05:21.720]  started to approach you and some of them, me as well, on this magnetic phenomenon that's happening,
[3:05:21.720 --> 3:05:26.040]  I did a little bit of digging and looked to see if there was any kind of a relationship. And that's
[3:05:26.040 --> 3:05:31.720]  where we came up with the company called Chemacell, that is located in Berlin. And they have a very
[3:05:31.720 --> 3:05:38.840]  elegant website, very sophisticated, with a huge list of chemicals that assist in adding
[3:05:38.840 --> 3:05:47.400]  magnetofection, which is a way to target cells in the body or any animal, to move the mRNA molecule
[3:05:47.400 --> 3:05:54.760]  into target cells. They call them target any cell, actually. And so, after we aired that,
[3:05:54.760 --> 3:06:03.560]  we had a tip from a police detective in Berlin who advises us that when he went to look at that
[3:06:03.560 --> 3:06:11.240]  corporation, he found that the same address for Chemacell, same building, same operation,
[3:06:12.040 --> 3:06:19.240]  included the company TIB Mobile, which is, and I previously reported slightly mistakenly,
[3:06:19.240 --> 3:06:25.160]  that it was owned by a Christian Drosten, but it's actually owned by a long-term friend of
[3:06:25.160 --> 3:06:31.880]  his named Olfort Launt. And he's the CEO of TIB Mobile. And the reason this is important is
[3:06:31.880 --> 3:06:39.800]  because this is the mobile company produces the PCR kits right now that are used worldwide,
[3:06:39.800 --> 3:06:45.960]  as well as other companies. And they are in the same facility as the company that produces
[3:06:45.960 --> 3:06:52.600]  a huge collection of magnetofection chemicals that assist with driving this mRNA into every cell
[3:06:52.600 --> 3:06:58.040]  in your body. And I want people to understand, if you're not familiar with Christian Drosten,
[3:06:58.040 --> 3:07:04.840]  you need to know that he is on the editorial board of the organization called Euro Surveillance.
[3:07:04.840 --> 3:07:11.400]  Now, this is not the UDRAW surveillance, which is the equivalent of our U.S. VAERS system.
[3:07:11.400 --> 3:07:17.000]  This is another organization that advises European countries on healthcare policy. So,
[3:07:17.000 --> 3:07:22.600]  he's on this editorial board, but he published his paper, second author, coincidentally, was
[3:07:22.600 --> 3:07:29.720]  Olfort Launt, the CEO of Mobile, that makes the PCR test kits on how people, organization countries
[3:07:29.720 --> 3:07:37.640]  should use the PCR test, even though it's an innovator who's now since died. Dr. Kerry Mullins
[3:07:37.640 --> 3:07:44.440]  has said the test is way too general. It will find COVID in anything if you run the cycles high enough.
[3:07:44.440 --> 3:07:50.120]  So, we see this interlocking directorate, and it's critically important that people understand
[3:07:50.120 --> 3:07:57.720]  this connection. So, Christian Drosten and Olfort Launt wrote this paper. When you think about it,
[3:07:57.720 --> 3:08:03.000]  their editors of this organization, they actually published their own paper through their own
[3:08:03.000 --> 3:08:11.000]  organization. That's highly unacceptable. I don't understand how any of that is legal.
[3:08:12.840 --> 3:08:17.640]  This is like me being the expert on something, and then also working for a government agency that
[3:08:17.640 --> 3:08:23.240]  controls that particular industry, and then pushing or lobbying to the government that
[3:08:23.240 --> 3:08:29.240]  I work for on behalf of the people, my product. This would be like Mike Lindell being in charge
[3:08:29.240 --> 3:08:33.720]  of the pillow division at the Department of Health and Safety. I mean, it's just, it's absolutely
[3:08:33.720 --> 3:08:41.000]  absurd. It's worse than that. If you have a journal that publishes papers on a peer review
[3:08:41.000 --> 3:08:46.680]  basis, that means that no scientist is above peer review. His or her work has to be scrutinized,
[3:08:46.680 --> 3:08:52.440]  criticized, rewritten. Many times they send the scientists back. In this particular case, the
[3:08:52.440 --> 3:08:59.560]  reviewers, the authors were their own reviewers. That's highly unethical. It's not done. Up is
[3:08:59.560 --> 3:09:05.800]  down, down is up stew. It's absurd. Yeah, I have a whistleblower that I'm going to be talking about
[3:09:05.800 --> 3:09:10.840]  here shortly who called me, and it's in reference to some of those things, where this stuff is
[3:09:10.840 --> 3:09:16.280]  coming from and why it's in there. But there are so many questions that I have for you today,
[3:09:16.280 --> 3:09:19.880]  and at the last minute you're making yourself available, and I hope that you can stick around
[3:09:19.880 --> 3:09:24.920]  for the duration because there are a lot of messages inside of my telegram. I'm getting email
[3:09:24.920 --> 3:09:30.600]  after email of people who are experiencing vaccine injuries. Since we did Brittany Galvin on my show,
[3:09:30.600 --> 3:09:34.280]  who by the way, if you're unfamiliar with who she is, if you're a listener of the Alex Jones
[3:09:34.280 --> 3:09:39.560]  show and you don't know who Brittany Galvin is, this is a girl who she was the first patient to
[3:09:39.560 --> 3:09:44.920]  have a neurosurgeon that was brave enough to actually diagnose her with this guillon beret
[3:09:44.920 --> 3:09:51.640]  and say that it was absolutely unequivocally 100% because of the Moderna shot that she contracted
[3:09:51.640 --> 3:09:58.280]  this very serious syndrome, which could leave her paralyzed for life and ultimately could absolutely
[3:09:58.280 --> 3:10:03.800]  kill her. Guillon beret. There are also people suffering with tremors. There's another person
[3:10:03.800 --> 3:10:07.400]  that I was introduced to through Instagram, which I'm not really big over there because it's owned
[3:10:07.400 --> 3:10:12.280]  by the CCP, but I was contacted through there. I checked the message requests. There are people
[3:10:12.280 --> 3:10:17.960]  with these tremors now that are having cold shivers. These are perfectly healthy people, folks,
[3:10:17.960 --> 3:10:22.280]  and this whistleblower coming forward is a pharmacist. We're going to talk about her and
[3:10:22.280 --> 3:10:27.800]  some of the things that she said, as well as a very serious case that you just told me about,
[3:10:27.800 --> 3:10:30.600]  and that's all coming from up right after the break. Thank you so much for sticking around.

[3:13:07.240 --> 3:13:13.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:13:13.800 --> 3:13:34.040]  I love this. This is why I love doing this job. Honestly, I left 18 years as an investigator
[3:13:34.040 --> 3:13:40.280]  tracking down violent fugitives investigating criminals. Nothing has changed. Still investigating
[3:13:40.280 --> 3:13:46.200]  criminals, but now they just wear a different uniform. They're all the different class. They're
[3:13:46.200 --> 3:13:54.440]  all criminals and we're exposing them. I love it. I just what keeps me motivated, what keeps me going
[3:13:54.440 --> 3:13:59.560]  because believe me, there are days that are so incredibly challenging, so incredibly challenging
[3:13:59.560 --> 3:14:04.360]  to investigate every email that we get to look into every bit of corruption to try to figure
[3:14:04.360 --> 3:14:09.000]  out if there's a story behind this or that or this person. I mean, we're now talking about a
[3:14:09.000 --> 3:14:15.240]  Republican candidate in Florida who apparently, according to Deanna Lorraine, who was on a
[3:14:15.240 --> 3:14:22.120]  Stu Peter show earlier today, threatened to have Ukrainian and Russian assassins track down
[3:14:22.120 --> 3:14:29.080]  his opponent and murder her. This is really going on. So please, please, please tell your
[3:14:30.200 --> 3:14:35.400]  sheep neighbors what is really going on in this world and direct them to the truth right here
[3:14:35.400 --> 3:14:40.920]  at InfoWars and over at my place at stupeters.tv. Dr. Jane Ruby is joining us. We were just talking
[3:14:40.920 --> 3:14:48.840]  about something that is actually extremely huge. Understanding how heavy that information really
[3:14:48.840 --> 3:14:56.280]  is, that the company, Chemacell, these are the people meddling in this magneto-fection technology.
[3:14:56.840 --> 3:15:02.840]  Well, everybody in the world is denying the reality that people are magnetized after they get
[3:15:02.840 --> 3:15:08.520]  these injections. Magnetized even after not getting the injections, but being around people
[3:15:08.520 --> 3:15:12.520]  who are. And we don't know what is shedding with these people right now. We don't know
[3:15:13.160 --> 3:15:18.040]  exactly what side effects or what symptoms you might experience through this shedding
[3:15:18.040 --> 3:15:21.320]  or this transmission. We do know that they told us that these things were going to be
[3:15:21.320 --> 3:15:25.400]  self-transmitting, that they were going to be basically contagious, that they were developing
[3:15:25.400 --> 3:15:30.200]  this years ago, but they want you to believe that none of this is true. They want you to ignore
[3:15:30.200 --> 3:15:34.840]  what your eyes are seeing, ignore what your ears are hearing and completely disregard the thousands
[3:15:34.840 --> 3:15:39.880]  of self-recorded videos that you see on the CCPP controlled TikTok or over on Instagram. It's
[3:15:39.880 --> 3:15:45.800]  ridiculous. Chemacell, the company that is meddling in the technology for the magneto-fection,
[3:15:45.800 --> 3:15:51.720]  which Dr. Jane Ruby broke and exposed, was intentionally added to these vaccines. Pfizer,
[3:15:51.720 --> 3:15:57.320]  Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, all of them is in the same building, same suite with the people
[3:15:57.320 --> 3:16:04.360]  that are responsible for manufacturing PCR test kits. Absolutely insane. Now, Dr. Ruby,
[3:16:04.360 --> 3:16:11.000]  telling me during the break, the first confirmed case of multiple sclerosis documented direct
[3:16:11.000 --> 3:16:20.920]  result of the Pfizer jab. So the numbers are exploding of all kinds of what we know as auto
[3:16:20.920 --> 3:16:28.840]  immune diseases. MS, or multiple sclerosis, is one of those auto immune diseases. In this disease,
[3:16:28.840 --> 3:16:35.560]  the body attacks its own myelin. Your myelin is the sheath covering over your brain and spinal
[3:16:35.560 --> 3:16:42.280]  cord. Imagine if you have a process that starts multiple sclerosis and then you add on top of
[3:16:42.280 --> 3:16:50.680]  that booster shots of these injections to advance the MS. No wonder people like Brittany, who has
[3:16:50.680 --> 3:16:56.120]  another form of auto immune disease, Guillain-Barre syndrome. No wonder she's having trouble walking,
[3:16:56.120 --> 3:17:04.200]  a 30-year-old, 30-something-year-old mother of three. What basically happens is we know the spike
[3:17:04.200 --> 3:17:09.960]  proteins are going everywhere. We've been told that this injection doesn't leave the injection
[3:17:09.960 --> 3:17:15.240]  site. And yet at the same time, we're reading all kinds of reports that the spike proteins,
[3:17:15.240 --> 3:17:22.280]  that the injections delivery of mRNA molecule forces your body to make, are being found in
[3:17:22.280 --> 3:17:28.440]  all kinds of organs and other places in your body. So it's not, in fact, the magnetofection
[3:17:28.440 --> 3:17:35.720]  process, when added to the lipid nanoparticles, actually drives, it's a stronger delivery system
[3:17:35.720 --> 3:17:41.880]  to get this to every cell in the body because it breaks through natural barriers. The most
[3:17:41.880 --> 3:17:45.960]  famous barrier everyone knows is the blood-brain barrier. Not everything is supposed to get
[3:17:45.960 --> 3:17:51.320]  through the brain, as you can imagine, but putting this nanoparticle and charging it with
[3:17:51.320 --> 3:17:57.960]  magnetofection ensures that it goes past those lipid barriers and that's what's happening here.
[3:17:57.960 --> 3:18:02.840]  So I wanted to also share with you and the viewers that something else is happening,
[3:18:02.840 --> 3:18:07.400]  especially that we're being lied to about the fact that these are supposedly not leaving the
[3:18:07.400 --> 3:18:13.080]  injection site. There was a report, and we're still getting more information on it, that there
[3:18:13.080 --> 3:18:20.680]  are changes in the blood, the shape, the morphology of your blood cells. I provided your producers
[3:18:20.680 --> 3:18:28.680]  with a photograph that shows four different photographs from something called dark field
[3:18:28.680 --> 3:18:38.440]  microscopy. And this is like a deep microscope that is able to ferret out unnecessary light
[3:18:38.440 --> 3:18:45.240]  to give you a more specific look at blood cells. And one of the, in the upper left-hand corner,
[3:18:45.240 --> 3:18:52.760]  the cells are of normal healthy red blood cells. Somebody took the blood from someone who had
[3:18:52.760 --> 3:18:59.400]  been injected with their second shot. I'm not aware of which company. Well, Pfizer and Moderna
[3:18:59.400 --> 3:19:06.200]  are the only two right now with two injection theories. And so they looked at that person's
[3:19:06.200 --> 3:19:14.040]  blood several days after they were injected with the second shot. What you're seeing in the picture
[3:19:14.040 --> 3:19:20.440]  to the right, in the upper right-hand corner, are the blood cells several days after the shot.
[3:19:20.440 --> 3:19:24.760]  You can see that they're not smooth and round the way red blood cells are supposed to be.
[3:19:26.600 --> 3:19:31.000]  I'm seeing some stuff going on on the screen. We're operating out of a different studio here
[3:19:31.000 --> 3:19:35.320]  today, so I think that there's just some issues pulling that up. But I will make sure that we
[3:19:35.320 --> 3:19:39.080]  get that up on the website as well, so that people can understand what it is that you're
[3:19:39.080 --> 3:19:44.520]  referring to. But they definitely change your blood cells. We're being lied to in that regard.
[3:19:44.520 --> 3:19:51.880]  These things actually change your blood cells. They damage cells. Yes, that's what I'm explaining.
[3:19:51.880 --> 3:19:58.600]  They change the shape, which is the morphology of your red blood cells. It looks like the nucleus
[3:19:58.600 --> 3:20:03.480]  has been damaged because when you get to see the photo, the nucleus of the red blood cells
[3:20:03.480 --> 3:20:10.200]  becomes very whitened and enlarged. That tells me there's a high inflammatory process going on.
[3:20:10.200 --> 3:20:16.600]  And then in a third picture, you can see a lot of white specks that are surrounding the plasma
[3:20:16.600 --> 3:20:22.040]  around those red blood cells and the blood cells themselves. And those are the lipid nanoparticles
[3:20:22.040 --> 3:20:27.480]  that are just profusely and ubiquitously throughout the bloodstream. So again,
[3:20:28.360 --> 3:20:33.560]  and then the fourth picture just for future reference is the red blood cells with these,
[3:20:33.560 --> 3:20:40.600]  it looks like embedded particles in them. Don't tell me that this material that's being injected
[3:20:40.600 --> 3:20:47.000]  from these shots stays at the site of injection, which is the upper arm, the deltoid muscle,
[3:20:47.000 --> 3:20:57.080]  because they're not. 25 people died as a result of the swine flu vaccination program. 25 people,
[3:20:57.080 --> 3:21:01.720]  it was immediately halted. We've talked about this at Nazium. I know that you guys have this
[3:21:01.720 --> 3:21:06.760]  information, but this has to sink in. This has to resonate with the people that you know. I'm
[3:21:06.760 --> 3:21:11.480]  thinking about standing right outside of pharmacies. I'm thinking about standing right outside of the
[3:21:11.480 --> 3:21:15.960]  CVS with a big sign and just warning people. I feel like it's almost my duty to stand there and
[3:21:15.960 --> 3:21:20.760]  tell people exactly what's going on. And we only have about 45 seconds left here in this segment,
[3:21:20.760 --> 3:21:27.480]  but if you have something quick. When the famous antidepressant drug, Selexa,
[3:21:27.480 --> 3:21:32.520]  was being tested in animal studies in the 80s, six beagle dogs died of heart attacks.
[3:21:32.520 --> 3:21:38.680]  Stu, they shut that program down for six dead dogs before they even got to humans.
[3:21:38.680 --> 3:21:43.480]  We have over 6,000, and that's a conservative estimate, dead in the United States. What are we
[3:21:43.480 --> 3:21:50.120]  doing? Could be 60,000 or 600,000. If you follow the Harvard study, we know that 1% or less of
[3:21:50.120 --> 3:21:54.040]  these things are actually accurately reported to VAERS because it's a very complicated system.
[3:21:54.040 --> 3:21:57.960]  And they're screwing with those numbers over there as well. I'm going to talk to you about
[3:21:57.960 --> 3:22:01.720]  why this is all happening and where the doctors are coming up next. Don't go anywhere. This is
[3:22:01.720 --> 3:22:05.560]  the Alex Jones show. My name is Stu Peter. The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning
[3:22:05.560 --> 3:22:11.640]  you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational. The globalists are out of
[3:22:11.640 --> 3:22:17.400]  the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover. But the good news is we've
[3:22:17.400 --> 3:22:21.560]  been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades
[3:22:21.560 --> 3:22:26.840]  to get ready for this, to be able to find it off. Humanity is strong. We're incredible. And if we're
[3:22:26.840 --> 3:22:31.000]  aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it. If we ask God for
[3:22:31.000 --> 3:22:36.040]  guidance, we will defeat it. So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is
[3:22:36.040 --> 3:22:40.760]  essential, and warning others is absolutely essential. And at the same time, supporting
[3:22:40.760 --> 3:22:45.240]  info wars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great
[3:22:45.240 --> 3:22:51.400]  products for you and your family. And they're also funding our operation info wars store.com info

[3:23:06.440 --> 3:23:10.920]  the good men do nothing. Well, I'm trying to be a good man. I'm trying to stand up to the right
[3:23:10.920 --> 3:23:17.240]  thing. And I've seen huge effects with what we've done here at info wars, other good men and women

[3:24:06.200 --> 3:24:10.920]  and high end crude oil more than a decade ago because the scientific literature is overwhelming.
[3:24:10.920 --> 3:24:15.560]  It's good for your heart, your brain, your whole body, your well being. A lot of folks take it
[3:24:15.560 --> 3:24:20.600]  before they take tests. People that have arthritis pain, they take it. It's well known for the things
[3:24:20.600 --> 3:24:26.680]  it does for a body. It makes our lives so much better. Then I learned about high grade fish oil
[3:24:26.680 --> 3:24:31.480]  and high grade crude oil. And we've gotten both info wars store.com. But with the COVID lockdown,
[3:24:31.480 --> 3:24:34.920]  supply chains have broken down. So it's been months and months and months since we've had
[3:24:34.920 --> 3:24:39.160]  crude oil back in stock. Well, let's get back, ladies and gentlemen. And despite the fact that
[3:24:39.160 --> 3:24:45.160]  it's already very fairly priced to the grade it is highest quality, we're offering it at 40% off
[3:24:45.160 --> 3:24:50.360]  for a limited time at info wars store.com with free shipping and double patriot points. Because
[3:24:50.360 --> 3:24:53.560]  I want those of you that have already been customers have a chance to get more of it. And I
[3:24:53.560 --> 3:24:58.040]  want new viewers and listeners who haven't tried it to get it from us and then try regular crude
[3:24:58.040 --> 3:25:03.240]  oil that is not one 10th as powerful as ours. This is the highest grade back in stock info wars
[3:25:03.240 --> 3:25:10.120]  store.com. Info wars is here because there's a war on for your mind. That's why I spent our motto
[3:25:10.120 --> 3:25:16.280]  for more than 25 years. And if you research even the UN's own admissions over 2 billion people on
[3:25:16.280 --> 3:25:22.680]  planet earth out of 7.5 billion have cognitive disabilities lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[3:25:22.680 --> 3:25:27.560]  That's why they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food isn't in the salt anymore. Now regular
[3:25:27.560 --> 3:25:34.200]  iodine that you find in food is bound to different minerals. And so it's hard for your body to absorb.
[3:25:34.200 --> 3:25:38.120]  But if you get the proper type of iodine, there's three types that are good for the body,
[3:25:38.120 --> 3:25:43.400]  it does amazing things. It's essential in the body. But we have our amazing tri iodine,
[3:25:43.400 --> 3:25:48.760]  a big shipment came in and so we're able to offer it at the lowest price ever 60% off. That is

[3:26:04.120 --> 3:26:18.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:26:25.720 --> 3:26:29.640]  Stu Peters, stewpeters.tv. Check me out. I'd appreciate it. Come on over anytime.
[3:26:29.640 --> 3:26:35.960]  You know, much similar. We do nothing but truth. And although the topics may overlap every once
[3:26:35.960 --> 3:26:40.440]  in a while, Alex can't keep track of me nor can I keep track of what he's doing. And if I'm being
[3:26:40.440 --> 3:26:46.440]  redundant to repetitive, I can apologize. Breaking over there right now today, a senator in Minnesota
[3:26:46.440 --> 3:26:52.200]  here actually sent a threatening email to a voter that requested a forensic audit of the 2020
[3:26:52.200 --> 3:26:58.600]  election here. Very polite, but very persistent. She sent an email to Minnesota Senator Jim
[3:26:58.600 --> 3:27:05.720]  Carlson in response to her requesting a forensic audit of the 2020 election here in the state of
[3:27:05.720 --> 3:27:13.240]  Minnesota. This guy at 1247 a.m. Now I don't know about you. I'm sleeping at 1247 a.m. But conveniently
[3:27:13.240 --> 3:27:16.840]  that's right around bar clothes here in the state of Minnesota as well. I don't know what Jim
[3:27:16.840 --> 3:27:23.080]  Carlson is into if the senator was on a drunken stupor or what he was doing, but he starts emailing
[3:27:23.080 --> 3:27:30.840]  her back at 1247 a.m. It ended up with threatening emails from him to her. That story is at stupeders.tv.
[3:27:30.840 --> 3:27:35.160]  I know where you live. I know everything about you. I know where your family is.
[3:27:36.600 --> 3:27:40.520]  Scary world that we live in right now. And you know, these people that are supposed to be charged
[3:27:40.520 --> 3:27:46.760]  with the responsibility of protecting you and the voice of the people, their very job is to go and
[3:27:46.760 --> 3:27:52.600]  represent the voices of their constituents to take care of the concerns that their constituents
[3:27:52.600 --> 3:27:57.560]  have. And rather than that, instead, he turns around and says that he knows where she lives
[3:27:57.560 --> 3:28:02.920]  and that she better stop emailing him. Very polite. You'll see all the emails over there at
[3:28:02.920 --> 3:28:07.480]  stupeders.tv. We have Dr. Jane Ruby on here. We were talking about MS before we went to break.
[3:28:07.480 --> 3:28:14.600]  Two or six Beagle dogs died as a result of an injection. They immediately halted that vaccine
[3:28:14.600 --> 3:28:21.080]  process. 25 people died in a swine flu. They immediately halted that. We have upwards of
[3:28:21.080 --> 3:28:25.800]  possibly 600,000 people injured or dead as a result of this inoculation,
[3:28:25.800 --> 3:28:29.800]  this vaccine, which we're going to talk about specifically exactly how hidden
[3:28:29.800 --> 3:28:34.760]  the contents of this thing really are. But first, you wanted to touch a little bit more on this MS.
[3:28:36.200 --> 3:28:42.840]  I believe I got word that the producers were able to locate that photo that is really helpful
[3:28:42.840 --> 3:28:50.600]  showing the differences in the blood, the red blood cells of people who have been injected with
[3:28:50.600 --> 3:28:57.720]  any of these four injections to. And what we're seeing in the upper left-hand corner is a collection
[3:28:57.720 --> 3:29:02.920]  of normal red blood cells. They're nice and round. They're healthy. They're plump. And they're filled
[3:29:02.920 --> 3:29:12.200]  with the red ferritin iron that carries your oxygen. In the upper right-hand corner, you're
[3:29:12.200 --> 3:29:18.520]  seeing the beginning several days after the second injection of one of these injections.
[3:29:18.520 --> 3:29:23.640]  And you can see that the shape is changing, becoming very abnormal, spotty around the edges.
[3:29:23.640 --> 3:29:29.640]  They're not round. The inner, the nucleus looks inflamed. It's white and widened. And then the
[3:29:29.640 --> 3:29:34.840]  lower left-hand corner, you're seeing probably after about five days. This is by the, like I said
[3:29:34.840 --> 3:29:40.680]  before, dark field microscopy. In the lower left-hand corner, you see a lot of these dots and kind of,
[3:29:40.680 --> 3:29:45.400]  you know, irregularities on the outside. These are the red blood cells fighting for their lives.
[3:29:45.400 --> 3:29:51.560]  In the right, bottom-right corner, you see all these white specks. Those are believed to be the
[3:29:51.560 --> 3:29:56.680]  lipid nanoparticles. Don't tell me that these injections stay at the injection site. And
[3:29:56.680 --> 3:30:01.640]  they're not only surrounding the red blood cells. They're damaging them. You can see an inflammatory
[3:30:01.640 --> 3:30:08.600]  process. There's like a war on for our blood. We are verifying with the person who ran these tests
[3:30:08.600 --> 3:30:14.360]  and hopefully get them on the show soon, if possible. And I really want to send my thanks to the
[3:30:14.360 --> 3:30:18.680]  producers for getting this up and running. I think it's a really powerful photograph that
[3:30:18.680 --> 3:30:22.520]  should be. Yeah, they're great. They're incredible. And you're right. They're lying.
[3:30:23.640 --> 3:30:30.520]  This should be the duty of medical professionals, of doctors, of pharmacists, of people, anybody
[3:30:30.520 --> 3:30:36.040]  that's responsible for injecting this stuff into the bloodstream of unsuspecting Americans who
[3:30:36.040 --> 3:30:41.880]  have no idea. You know, you can't really necessarily blame them. They have no idea. They go home after
[3:30:41.880 --> 3:30:47.000]  a long day at work. They turn on the TV. They listen to their evening news without any clue
[3:30:47.000 --> 3:30:51.960]  whatsoever that this whole thing has been hijacked. They don't know that the same six corporations own
[3:30:51.960 --> 3:30:57.560]  Fox, his own MSNBC or CNN, that they're all reading from the same exact script. I challenge
[3:30:57.560 --> 3:31:02.040]  anybody, if you don't believe me, when you have 15 minutes of time, sit down in your living room
[3:31:02.040 --> 3:31:06.280]  and turn them on. Turn on the different channel. You will listen to them. They're reading the exact,
[3:31:06.280 --> 3:31:13.880]  not only similar messages, verbatim. They're saying the same words. So you can't blame these people,
[3:31:13.880 --> 3:31:19.240]  but what about these medical professionals? Why are doctors, Dr. Jane Ruby, continuing
[3:31:20.040 --> 3:31:26.920]  to give this thing to people knowing that this information is out there, knowing that 5,000
[3:31:26.920 --> 3:31:32.600]  or 5,500 or 6,000 are reported to VAERS. They don't even have to take the Harvard study into
[3:31:32.600 --> 3:31:37.320]  account. I mean, if 6,000 is the number, we're stopping something for six beagles for crying
[3:31:37.320 --> 3:31:43.240]  all out. Why are they still injecting these people? Sue, this is a very good question.
[3:31:43.240 --> 3:31:48.120]  I'm glad you brought it up. You touched on something earlier. People have been relying on
[3:31:48.120 --> 3:31:53.960]  the good faith and trust in physicians and nurses and pharmacists for centuries.
[3:31:54.680 --> 3:32:01.400]  Why is this happening? I have coined the phrase zombie doctor. Why? Because so many American
[3:32:01.400 --> 3:32:07.720]  physicians and physicians outside of the United States, so many physicians are just blindly
[3:32:07.720 --> 3:32:14.280]  telling their patients, oh, go get the shot. It's perfectly safe for everyone. I've told them to
[3:32:14.280 --> 3:32:18.520]  push back on their doctors and asked, well, is there anybody this isn't safe for? Because,
[3:32:18.520 --> 3:32:24.040]  Sue, there's nothing in the world that's 100% safe. So I've coined the term zombie doctors,
[3:32:24.040 --> 3:32:29.800]  and I've sent out pictures of doctors, there are zombies drenched in blood holding up needles
[3:32:29.800 --> 3:32:35.720]  and coming after you because doctors have a responsibility to look at the literature
[3:32:35.720 --> 3:32:40.200]  before recommending something. And to answer your questions, Sue, there are only two reasons why
[3:32:40.200 --> 3:32:45.720]  this is happening. One, doctors are ignorant or lazy and they're not doing the research. They're
[3:32:45.720 --> 3:32:50.840]  not looking at the same studies that I can find in the public domain to look at the dangers and
[3:32:50.840 --> 3:32:56.200]  look at what this injection is really made of. And that is dereliction of duty and the highest
[3:32:56.200 --> 3:33:01.800]  order of a violation of the Hippocratic oath ever. Or even worse, in my mind, although I think
[3:33:01.800 --> 3:33:07.880]  they're both equally worse, these doctors are being paid. How are they being paid? They're being paid,
[3:33:07.880 --> 3:33:13.560]  they're incentivized by the pharma companies through grants. And these things are all kind
[3:33:13.560 --> 3:33:21.080]  of hidden and wrapped around and they get around federal regs. Or I've seen insurance companies
[3:33:21.080 --> 3:33:27.480]  like Blue Cross and Blue Shield actually provide bonuses for a certain percentage of the doctor's
[3:33:28.440 --> 3:33:35.320]  patient population inoculated. Sue, these are in direct violation of all 10 of the
[3:33:35.320 --> 3:33:41.160]  Nuremberg codes. And it's got to stop. And I'm calling attention to zombie doctors because I
[3:33:41.160 --> 3:33:45.880]  want doctors to start taking responsibility. My own doctor down here, when I moved to Florida,
[3:33:45.880 --> 3:33:50.760]  just recently, great doctor, great examination at the very end said, you know, you're really
[3:33:50.760 --> 3:33:55.960]  ought to think about taking the vaccination. Well, she said that to the wrong person. And when I'm
[3:33:55.960 --> 3:34:00.920]  laid it all out for her in about 90 seconds, her reply, she looked at a look of shock on her face
[3:34:00.920 --> 3:34:06.040]  and her reply was, oh, my, I guess I better go back and do some reading. Totally oblivious to the
[3:34:06.040 --> 3:34:12.200]  fact that this was not a vaccine and drinking the Kool-Aid of the CDC depends on to take care
[3:34:12.200 --> 3:34:17.480]  of their personal health. These are the people that are so incredibly entrusted. And let me
[3:34:17.480 --> 3:34:23.560]  just illustrate how entrusted they are. If I put a glass of water in front of you, Dr. Jane,
[3:34:23.560 --> 3:34:28.280]  and I said, there is a 1% chance that this is poison and you're going to drink it and you're
[3:34:28.280 --> 3:34:36.600]  going to die. You of course would not drink that glass of water. So why in the hell would you allow
[3:34:36.600 --> 3:34:43.880]  somebody a total stranger to inject something directly into you that has the same or worse odds
[3:34:43.880 --> 3:34:49.160]  because they're wearing a lab coat? That is why people have entrusted these doctors. And I'm telling
[3:34:49.160 --> 3:34:54.120]  you, if what you're saying is true, and if we find out that these doctors are being compensated,
[3:34:54.120 --> 3:34:58.200]  that we already know it to be true, but if it can be proven, and if the media will grab a hold of
[3:34:58.200 --> 3:35:03.080]  this, and if 300 million people or more in this country can come to the realization that these
[3:35:03.080 --> 3:35:08.280]  doctors have been intentionally lying to them for money, can you imagine the falling out?
[3:35:08.280 --> 3:35:12.280]  Can you imagine what might happen to these doctors? My God, I would have to pray for them.
[3:35:12.280 --> 3:35:18.280]  Sue, doctors are obligated to report all money they receive from pharma companies in something
[3:35:18.280 --> 3:35:22.840]  called the Sunshine Act. So it's very easy to prove. And what I'm worried about as we close
[3:35:22.840 --> 3:35:28.200]  here are the children, these pediatricians that are coming out and saying, yes, inject them as
[3:35:28.200 --> 3:35:33.240]  low as birth, two or three months old. Sue, this has got to stop. We've got to save the children.
[3:35:34.120 --> 3:35:39.320]  Well, we're not closing because I've got amazing information on a whistleblower.
[3:35:39.320 --> 3:35:48.040]  She is a pharmacist, okay? And she has come forward. I'm not ready to release what she has,
[3:35:48.040 --> 3:35:53.080]  but there's an amazing phenomenon going on here that she told me about. And I want to talk to
[3:35:53.080 --> 3:35:56.040]  you about that. If you have the time to stick around, I would like to have you on for just
[3:35:56.040 --> 3:36:00.920]  one more segment. Dr. Jane Ruby joins us. This is the Alex Jones show on Info Wars. My name is
[3:36:00.920 --> 3:36:05.560]  Stu Peters at stupeters.tv. We'll be back in a second. We here at Info Wars are proud to announce
[3:36:05.560 --> 3:36:12.280]  the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that is now available at infowarstore.com. Kava is one
[3:36:12.280 --> 3:36:17.160]  of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for
[3:36:17.160 --> 3:36:22.120]  hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[3:36:22.120 --> 3:36:27.800]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[3:36:27.800 --> 3:36:33.080]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe. The Samoan people
[3:36:33.080 --> 3:36:38.120]  would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[3:36:38.120 --> 3:36:42.920]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[3:36:42.920 --> 3:36:48.600]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava,
[3:36:48.600 --> 3:36:54.280]  but other herbs including but not limited to German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap,
[3:36:54.280 --> 3:37:00.280]  and Balarian root. We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by
[3:37:00.280 --> 3:37:07.400]  visiting infowarstore.com. Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry
[3:37:07.400 --> 3:37:15.080]  in 1900 with the petrochemical. The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics
[3:37:15.080 --> 3:37:22.280]  and drugs. Companies began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs. The natural
[3:37:22.280 --> 3:37:28.600]  sources were then made illegal. Pharmaceuticals became medicine and the sicker people got,
[3:37:28.600 --> 3:37:33.720]  the more their industry grew. It's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape.
[3:37:34.280 --> 3:37:39.720]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[3:37:40.360 --> 3:37:46.680]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today. The combinations of vitamin C and zinc
[3:37:46.680 --> 3:37:53.640]  and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.
[3:37:53.640 --> 3:37:59.000]  Go to infowarstore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the mega
[3:37:59.000 --> 3:38:06.920]  immune support pack. Now 40% off. Bio remediation is a process used to treat
[3:38:06.920 --> 3:38:11.400]  contaminated water, soil, and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring
[3:38:11.400 --> 3:38:16.360]  environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.

[3:40:13.560 --> 3:40:31.720]  Please come and find me at stupeters.tv. I love you guys and I really appreciate you having me here
[3:40:31.720 --> 3:40:36.120]  every Friday in this fourth hour of the Alex Jones show. My name is Stu Peters. If there's one thing
[3:40:36.120 --> 3:40:44.280]  that we have failed to do, I think, in times past, in my humble and honest opinion, our biggest,
[3:40:44.280 --> 3:40:49.960]  one of our biggest downfalls, Dr. Jane, is that we have failed to give credit to the enemy for
[3:40:49.960 --> 3:40:54.840]  their ability to plan, for their ability to orchestrate, for their ability to stick together,
[3:40:54.840 --> 3:41:02.200]  to maintain a narrative, to project propaganda, to slowly infiltrate every aspect of our lives
[3:41:02.200 --> 3:41:07.160]  without firing a single shot, without being detected, completely quiet. They're like little
[3:41:07.160 --> 3:41:12.360]  termites and they have been gnawing away at the foundation of this country for an incredibly long
[3:41:12.360 --> 3:41:20.040]  time and now they're going after our kids. And when, you know, these people say that this emergency
[3:41:20.040 --> 3:41:26.680]  use authorization goes down to as young as age 12, there are certain pharmacists because there are
[3:41:26.680 --> 3:41:30.680]  many of us who are a part of this great awakening. There are many of us whose eyes have been
[3:41:30.680 --> 3:41:35.000]  incredibly open. I had no idea that a lot of this stuff was going on. I really didn't.
[3:41:35.560 --> 3:41:39.640]  And if there's one thing that I can credit Donald J. Trump for, it was making me question
[3:41:39.640 --> 3:41:44.360]  everything. And I give him a lot of credit for a lot of things. That's just one of the biggest
[3:41:44.360 --> 3:41:48.440]  things I think is that I literally question everything and I consider absolutely everything
[3:41:48.440 --> 3:41:54.280]  to be a possibility. But this little infestation of these termites has now become a catastrophic
[3:41:54.280 --> 3:42:00.760]  complication for our kids. As parents and grandparents are literally walking these kids straight
[3:42:00.760 --> 3:42:06.680]  into a CVS, straight into a Walgreens or whatever pharmacy you go to, straight into a doctor's
[3:42:06.680 --> 3:42:13.240]  office to grab this jab because they're afraid of COVID. They're afraid of COVID-19. You have
[3:42:13.240 --> 3:42:18.360]  told us before, viruses burn down, not up. As far as I'm concerned, the whole COVID thing is dead.
[3:42:18.360 --> 3:42:23.560]  It's gone. It's over with. There is no pandemic. And when people start suing these states, when
[3:42:23.560 --> 3:42:29.080]  people start suing their governors, their attorneys general for enforcing these lockdown mandates,
[3:42:29.080 --> 3:42:34.440]  when they start suing them for being fired from their jobs, for refusing to get inoculated,
[3:42:34.440 --> 3:42:39.160]  when they start suing these people, the one thing that they will have to do when they subpoena
[3:42:39.160 --> 3:42:44.600]  these attorneys general and these governors is the one thing that I would encourage them to do,
[3:42:44.600 --> 3:42:49.720]  and Louis Ewing would also encourage this, is they should ask, because they have to prove
[3:42:49.720 --> 3:42:55.240]  that there is an active pandemic. And I don't know that they can do that, but nonetheless,
[3:42:55.240 --> 3:42:59.000]  we have these people going in. And so Dr. Jane, I was contacted in my proton mail
[3:43:00.360 --> 3:43:04.440]  by a pharmacist. I got to be really careful here because I don't want to expose this person.
[3:43:04.440 --> 3:43:10.280]  We're talking hidden cameras and all kinds of stuff. But this person who originally contacted me
[3:43:10.920 --> 3:43:17.720]  has been working at a pharmacy and has been jabbing people. And as she woke up and started
[3:43:17.720 --> 3:43:23.480]  realizing what it is that's going on, and it was, I'll take credit for it. She found my telegram
[3:43:23.480 --> 3:43:28.360]  channel and she found you. And so she's like, whoa, this is really going on. And she started
[3:43:28.360 --> 3:43:32.680]  doing her own research and she found out, oh my holy smokes. And it really blew her mind that she
[3:43:32.680 --> 3:43:39.800]  has been participating in this and she was ready to walk. And she was considering walking and then
[3:43:39.800 --> 3:43:44.920]  she was considering participating in some way, shape or form. And she came to the conclusion
[3:43:44.920 --> 3:43:50.600]  on her own, if I were to leave right now, somebody else would just fill my shoes. So I'm going to
[3:43:50.600 --> 3:43:54.040]  stay and I'm going to do the right thing. And every war and every battle, there is collateral
[3:43:54.040 --> 3:43:58.440]  damage. There are innocent people that die in Paris. There are casualties that are untargeted
[3:43:58.440 --> 3:44:03.720]  people. And unfortunately, those are the times that we're in. It's really a horrifying place
[3:44:03.720 --> 3:44:08.280]  that we're in in this country right now when you actually sit down and think about that these are
[3:44:08.280 --> 3:44:15.560]  people's lives that we're talking about and these kids. And so in conversation with her,
[3:44:15.560 --> 3:44:23.240]  she told me that she learned yesterday that there are 20 pharmacists at her chain or whatever that
[3:44:23.240 --> 3:44:28.040]  are leaving. And then I started doing some research on that. There was an article just
[3:44:28.040 --> 3:44:33.400]  yesterday. I don't remember where I saw it, but 20 CVS people are leaving. There's whistleblowers
[3:44:33.400 --> 3:44:39.800]  coming out and saying that we don't know what we're injecting in these people. I want to talk
[3:44:39.800 --> 3:44:45.080]  about something. I want to ask you about these inserts, whatever they're called, these pieces
[3:44:45.080 --> 3:44:51.880]  of paper that come inside of the box or the lot where these injections are sent to the pharmacists.
[3:44:52.840 --> 3:44:57.240]  These things, just like any other medication, have an insert and that insert is supposed to list
[3:44:57.240 --> 3:45:00.760]  ingredients. I'm being told that they are intentionally blank. And I've seen them.
[3:45:00.760 --> 3:45:05.720]  They are. They're blank. Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson. How important is this piece of paper?
[3:45:05.720 --> 3:45:13.080]  And is it, am I just thinking over thinking this or is that alarming to you as a pharmaceutical
[3:45:13.080 --> 3:45:22.520]  researcher expert that these things are blank? So when people understand what that piece of paper
[3:45:22.520 --> 3:45:30.120]  is, they are going to be, I hope, very angry. That piece of paper is called the package insert.
[3:45:30.120 --> 3:45:34.440]  That's the little piece of paper that most of us throw out when we open up our
[3:45:34.440 --> 3:45:43.080]  new aspirin or Advil bottle. That's called the package insert. That's actually a legal document
[3:45:43.080 --> 3:45:49.800]  that I can tell you from the beginning is hammered out between the pharmaceutical company and the
[3:45:49.800 --> 3:45:57.880]  FDA. Every word I'm telling you, every number, every punctuation mark is negotiated and approved
[3:45:57.880 --> 3:46:05.320]  by the FDA or it cannot be in that insert. And it is based on the studies. And that package
[3:46:05.320 --> 3:46:10.280]  insert, if you look the next time of any other drug, you will see that there are studies in
[3:46:10.280 --> 3:46:16.440]  there with graphs. There are warnings to doctors. There are warnings to patients. The package insert
[3:46:16.440 --> 3:46:22.840]  is a legal document. The fact that these vials of these four injections are being circulated
[3:46:22.840 --> 3:46:29.320]  throughout the United States and in the world with blank pieces of paper is an outrage. It is
[3:46:29.320 --> 3:46:37.240]  a dereliction of duty. It is the most incredibly corrupt thing that is going on that the FDA is
[3:46:37.240 --> 3:46:45.080]  not insisting on even a temporary package insert. It's also called the label. The label is a legal
[3:46:45.080 --> 3:46:51.400]  document. To have nothing at all, that means you have no information on the lot number. You have
[3:46:51.400 --> 3:46:57.320]  no information on safety. You have no information on efficacy, how efficacious it was. All we have
[3:46:57.320 --> 3:47:03.160]  are public statements and these pharma companies will not respond to the questions that normally
[3:47:03.160 --> 3:47:08.120]  would have been answered by these package inserts. The public statements that we are getting are from
[3:47:08.120 --> 3:47:13.320]  the people whose names are on the patents, from the investors who have a financial stake in this
[3:47:13.320 --> 3:47:18.120]  game. I mentioned it would be like Mike Lindell doing the pillow issuance for the government
[3:47:18.120 --> 3:47:22.600]  on behalf of the government. These people's names are clearly printed, publicly discoverable,
[3:47:22.600 --> 3:47:28.520]  right on the patent information that's behind the mRNA technology, that's behind this magnet
[3:47:28.520 --> 3:47:33.320]  infection, and it's behind the injection itself, Bill Gates, Anthony Fauci. The same people,
[3:47:33.320 --> 3:47:37.160]  at least one of them, who funded the lab that I and everybody else that's truthful,
[3:47:37.160 --> 3:47:41.640]  was called the liar for speculating that that was the lab in Wuhan where it leaked from.
[3:47:41.640 --> 3:47:46.200]  Now I'm speculating and have almost pretty positive circumstantial evidence that this
[3:47:46.200 --> 3:47:51.160]  thing was engineered. This is why Fauci was consistently emailing a woman by the name of
[3:47:51.160 --> 3:47:55.720]  Christina Cassetti. Christina Cassetti spent the last eight years of her life in Italy doing,
[3:47:55.720 --> 3:48:02.040]  guess what, engineering viruses. Why was he sending her chlorine dioxide or nitric oxide and saying,
[3:48:02.040 --> 3:48:07.640]  hey, I need you to take care of this, make this go away. It was a viable treatment. It was a cure,
[3:48:07.640 --> 3:48:13.640]  essentially, it made the SARS-CoV-2 virus die. It stopped it from spreading. These are the very
[3:48:13.640 --> 3:48:18.200]  people that are responsible. So going back to the leaflets, the inserts, could it be possible
[3:48:18.200 --> 3:48:23.320]  that you mentioned that everything is negotiated or approved by the FDA that goes into these things,
[3:48:23.320 --> 3:48:28.440]  every punctuation mark, every space, every letter? Is it possible that these are left blank because
[3:48:28.440 --> 3:48:32.360]  of the fact that this doesn't have FDA approval? And do you expect this thing in about a minute
[3:48:32.360 --> 3:48:36.360]  or less to ever eventually get FDA approval? Well, yeah, there she is. There's one of those
[3:48:36.360 --> 3:48:42.120]  pharmacists right there. This thing is a percent when she opens it up, it's 100% blank. Will this
[3:48:42.120 --> 3:48:49.080]  thing be FDA approved, Dr. Ruby? My opinion is that the reason these are blank is because,
[3:48:49.080 --> 3:48:53.960]  Stu, they didn't do the safety studies in humans. They didn't run the pharmacokinetics
[3:48:53.960 --> 3:48:59.400]  studies on humans. Pharmacokinetics are the study of, there are about 100 tests in there,
[3:48:59.400 --> 3:49:04.120]  but there are about 12 standard ones we expect to see in a package insert. And that is what happens
[3:49:04.120 --> 3:49:07.720]  to the drug when it goes in your body. Where does it go? Where does it concentrate? How does
[3:49:07.720 --> 3:49:13.400]  your body break it down? How is it absorbed? How is it excreted? Through urine, through feces,
[3:49:13.400 --> 3:49:19.320]  through sweat, all that information is incredibly important. And that's why it's not in there.
[3:49:19.320 --> 3:49:23.240]  And she's showing you a blank piece of paper because they don't have the information or
[3:49:23.880 --> 3:49:28.680]  they have it and they're not sharing it because it's bad. Prove me wrong.
[3:49:29.960 --> 3:49:34.440]  Owen Schreuer is coming next. Dr. Jane Ruby, thank you so much for your time. Go ahead. What were
[3:49:34.440 --> 3:49:39.720]  you going to say? I just wanted to answer your second question. I do believe they will be approved.
[3:49:39.720 --> 3:49:43.880]  I'm incredibly frightened about that because the corruption is not going to end, Stu.
[3:49:45.800 --> 3:49:50.200]  Unbelievable. Dr. Jane Ruby, thank you so much. You can email her, by the way, anytime if you
[3:49:50.200 --> 3:49:54.040]  want to blow the whistle on some of this stuff, Dr. Jane Ruby at protonmail.com. You can also find
[3:49:54.040 --> 3:49:58.680]  her at drjaneruby.com. Thank you so much. Owen Schreuer is coming up next with The War Room.
[3:49:58.680 --> 3:50:04.600]  I've heard that it's going to be an incredibly exciting show. Please find me over at stupeters.tv.
[3:50:04.600 --> 3:50:09.000]  Check out that story that we did today. This is absolutely unbelievable. Aside from all the
[3:50:09.000 --> 3:50:16.760]  medical tyranny, aside from Republican candidates in Florida threatening a hit squad, assassinations,
[3:50:17.480 --> 3:50:22.440]  assassins from Russia and Ukraine to go take out a political opponent, aside from all that,
[3:50:22.440 --> 3:50:29.320]  we now have voters, constituents politely reaching out, asking for somebody to consider a forensic
[3:50:29.320 --> 3:50:33.800]  audit of the 2020 election. I don't know why they might be doing that. There was no questions there,
[3:50:33.800 --> 3:50:38.360]  was there? Simply asking, could we please investigate this? Could we have a forensic
[3:50:38.360 --> 3:50:41.800]  audit of the vote here in the state of Minnesota? We want to make sure that these elections
[3:50:41.800 --> 3:50:46.520]  are full of integrity and transparent. Instead, she got threatened. That whole story is at
[3:50:46.520 --> 3:50:50.520]  stupeters.tv. I hope to see you guys again next Friday, right here on the Alex Jones show.
[3:50:50.520 --> 3:50:52.520]  Don't go anywhere. Owen Schreyer is up next.
