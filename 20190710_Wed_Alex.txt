[00:00.000 --> 00:21.200]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:21.200 --> 00:27.880]  What Facebook has done is so evil, so over the top, I don't have words to describe it.
[00:27.880 --> 00:31.800]  Paul Watson says they've issued a fatwa against him, myself, and others.
[00:31.800 --> 00:36.600]  If you're one of the individuals named as a dangerous person, Paul Watson, myself, and
[00:36.600 --> 00:40.560]  a few others have been, Facebook says that you're allowed to incite violence against
[00:40.560 --> 00:44.200]  them, docks their homes, and even kill them.
[00:44.200 --> 00:48.280]  It actually says, we want you to kill them.
[00:48.280 --> 00:50.840]  They say, kill them.
[00:50.840 --> 00:52.520]  Now this is official.
[00:52.520 --> 00:57.400]  This is a country of 2.4 billion people in a giant mind control facility that Zuckerberg
[00:57.400 --> 01:00.000]  controls, and they're preparing a violent revolution.
[01:00.000 --> 01:01.800]  This is unspeakable.
[01:01.800 --> 01:04.800]  Here's Paul Joseph Watson's report on it.
[01:04.800 --> 01:05.800]  Facebook's a private company.
[01:05.800 --> 01:07.600]  It can do what it likes.
[01:07.600 --> 01:08.600]  Really?
[01:08.600 --> 01:10.720]  Can it issue fatwa's against people?
[01:10.720 --> 01:11.920]  Because that's just what happened.
[01:11.920 --> 01:13.760]  I'm not even joking.
[01:13.760 --> 01:19.120]  Facebook literally posted an update to its community standards policy, saying it's acceptable
[01:19.120 --> 01:22.120]  to incite violence against me.
[01:22.120 --> 01:23.120]  Yes, really.
[01:23.120 --> 01:29.720]  So as you know, when Facebook banned me back in May, they designated me a dangerous individual.
[01:29.720 --> 01:30.720]  So dangerous.
[01:30.720 --> 01:33.800]  And then yesterday, Facebook posted this.
[01:33.800 --> 01:38.400]  Do not post threats that could lead to death and other forms of high severity violence
[01:38.400 --> 01:42.680]  of any targets where threat is defined as any of the following.
[01:42.680 --> 01:47.400]  Statements of intent to commit high severity violence or calls for high severity violence,
[01:47.400 --> 01:55.200]  unless the target is an organization or individual covered in the dangerous individuals and organizations
[01:55.200 --> 01:56.200]  policy.
[01:56.200 --> 01:57.200]  That's me.
[01:57.200 --> 02:02.520]  So in other words, Facebook just informed its 2 billion users that it's acceptable to
[02:02.520 --> 02:07.520]  post statements of intent of high severity violence against me.
[02:07.520 --> 02:14.600]  This is literally illegal in the United Kingdom under the 1988 Malicious Communications Act,
[02:14.600 --> 02:19.880]  which states, any person who sends to another person a letter, electronic communication
[02:19.880 --> 02:25.960]  or article of any description which conveys a threat is guilty of an offense.
[02:25.960 --> 02:28.320]  Facebook's a private company, it can do what it likes.
[02:28.320 --> 02:31.000]  Can it flagrantly break UK law?
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.200]  Can it openly incite violence against people?
[02:34.200 --> 02:40.520]  The largest social media company in the world with over 2 billion users says it's fine
[02:40.520 --> 02:45.880]  to incite violence against me, despite this being totally illegal.
[02:45.880 --> 02:51.680]  The same company that lectures us all the time about the need to stop hate is directly
[02:51.680 --> 02:53.320]  encouraging hate.
[02:53.320 --> 02:58.240]  This is like some futuristic sci-fi dystopia where the artificial intelligence takes over
[02:58.240 --> 03:01.360]  and starts marking people for elimination.
[03:01.360 --> 03:07.320]  Imagine a drone army of Mark Zuckerberg clones stomping on a human face forever.
[03:07.320 --> 03:08.320]  That's our collective future.
[03:08.320 --> 03:16.040]  And I was human, I am human, still.
[03:16.040 --> 03:18.600]  They're painting a target on my back.
[03:18.600 --> 03:24.120]  I've already received dozens of death threats on Facebook over the years, here, here, here
[03:24.120 --> 03:25.120]  and here.
[03:25.120 --> 03:29.560]  The world's eighth biggest corporation has literally sanctioned death threats against
[03:29.560 --> 03:32.560]  me for words I say on the internet.
[03:32.560 --> 03:33.560]  Where does it go?
[03:33.560 --> 03:35.880]  Where can it possibly go from here?
[03:35.880 --> 03:40.240]  And what could I possibly be saying that represents such a threat to them?
[03:40.240 --> 03:41.240]  Seriously.
[03:41.240 --> 03:42.240]  Facebook's a private company.
[03:42.240 --> 03:44.520]  It can solicit death threats against whoever it wants.
[03:44.520 --> 03:46.760]  Let me be crystal clear.
[03:46.760 --> 03:53.040]  Facebook is literally telling its 2 billion users they can break the law and incite violence
[03:53.040 --> 03:56.200]  against anyone Facebook doesn't like.
[03:56.200 --> 04:01.760]  Facebook is so power mad and out of control it thinks it's above the law.
[04:01.760 --> 04:03.360]  Let that sink in.
[04:03.360 --> 04:04.760]  Facebook is evil.
[04:04.760 --> 04:05.840]  They spy on you.
[04:05.840 --> 04:07.520]  They sell your data.
[04:07.520 --> 04:09.120]  Facebook is a cult.
[04:09.120 --> 04:15.040]  They demand uniformity of opinion and punish anyone who strays outside their ghetto of
[04:15.040 --> 04:16.600]  acceptable opinion.
[04:16.600 --> 04:21.320]  38% of Brits have stopped using Facebook in the past year alone.
[04:21.320 --> 04:22.920]  And so should you.
[04:22.920 --> 04:25.120]  Delete your Facebook account right now.
[04:25.120 --> 04:28.680]  And I'm not going to reveal my hand, but this is LawsuitCity.
[04:28.680 --> 04:32.640]  And if you want to help me with that, the subscribe star link is in the description.
[04:32.640 --> 04:36.920]  Oh, and that social media summit that begins at the White House today?
[04:36.920 --> 04:41.920]  Maybe the largest social media corporation on the planet issuing de facto fatwas against
[04:41.920 --> 04:46.840]  people for having the wrong political opinions should be part of the conversation.
[04:46.840 --> 04:47.840]  Just saying.
[04:47.840 --> 04:58.840]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[04:58.840 --> 05:09.720]  So the info wars model is a self fulfilling self supporting structure that is promoting
[05:09.720 --> 05:14.640]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[05:14.640 --> 05:15.640]  one another.
[05:15.640 --> 05:20.280]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach.
[05:20.280 --> 05:24.760]  It is the one model that says here's a way to have a self supporting self sustaining
[05:24.760 --> 05:29.280]  self structured little d democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[05:29.280 --> 05:33.640]  content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[05:33.640 --> 05:34.640]  and supporting info wars.
[05:34.640 --> 05:39.280]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50
[05:39.280 --> 05:43.160]  a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate
[05:43.160 --> 05:47.880]  driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press support speech
[05:47.880 --> 05:52.120]  support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want
[05:52.120 --> 05:57.280]  to hold and it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration
[05:57.280 --> 06:22.760]  of free press and free speech with free markets.
[06:22.760 --> 06:37.680]  Some deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones.
[06:37.680 --> 06:46.000]  Making fun of members of Congress are this great and there's no need for anyone to think
[06:46.000 --> 06:47.000]  that is unacceptable.
[06:47.000 --> 06:53.020]  We're going to shut them down and work with whoever it is to shut them down and they should
[06:53.020 --> 06:54.520]  be prosecuted.
[06:54.520 --> 06:55.720]  I want them shut down.
[06:55.720 --> 06:56.720]  I want them silent.
[06:56.720 --> 06:57.720]  I want them muted.
[06:57.720 --> 06:59.860]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[06:59.860 --> 07:01.360]  Why are they doing this now?
[07:01.360 --> 07:05.520]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but yeah, exactly.
[07:05.520 --> 07:11.920]  Yeah, I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time, but
[07:11.920 --> 07:12.920]  now they banned him.
[07:12.920 --> 07:15.640]  They banned his like little underling Paul Joseph Watson.
[07:15.640 --> 07:19.840]  Now that they keep them off the platform, that's great for now, but it doesn't roll
[07:19.840 --> 07:20.840]  back the clock.
[07:20.840 --> 07:24.920]  But you have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now.
[07:24.920 --> 07:29.400]  You know, I don't think that the forefathers said, well, you can say all sorts of hateful
[07:29.400 --> 07:33.560]  things and spread it around the world, literally spread it through the internet.
[07:33.560 --> 07:35.040]  I have no issue with it at all.
[07:35.040 --> 07:36.280]  I want them shut down.
[07:36.280 --> 07:37.280]  I want them silent.
[07:37.280 --> 07:38.280]  I want them muted.
[07:38.280 --> 07:41.160]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[07:41.160 --> 07:42.840]  I want them shut down.
[07:42.840 --> 07:44.200]  I want them silent.
[07:44.200 --> 07:45.200]  I want them muted.
[07:45.200 --> 07:52.200]  But don't worry, these people aren't terrifying or anything.
[07:52.200 --> 08:05.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have crossed the Rubicon, the point of no return.
[08:05.520 --> 08:12.560]  Facebook, in its terms of service, officially announced that their users can death threat
[08:12.560 --> 08:21.160]  docks and even incite people until conservatives are dead.
[08:21.160 --> 08:28.400]  They officially say you may organize people to commit murder of anyone deemed a dangerous
[08:28.400 --> 08:37.040]  individual by the 2.4 billion slave mass controlled by Mark Zuckerberg.
[08:37.040 --> 08:38.720]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:38.720 --> 08:41.840]  And they also tell you when they send you the message, do not post.
[08:41.840 --> 08:51.000]  Don't tell anyone that we're telling you inside this giant digital gulag, inside this giant
[08:51.000 --> 08:58.000]  digital reeducation camp, that's what reeducation camps are, that we're doing this.
[08:58.000 --> 09:01.120]  Now, Paul Watson's joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[09:01.120 --> 09:05.800]  And he specifically saw these reports when he was being death-threaded.
[09:05.800 --> 09:08.160]  But this is anyone deemed a dangerous individual.
[09:08.160 --> 09:17.800]  Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Watson, and just a few others like Lewis Farrakhan.
[09:17.800 --> 09:27.080]  Wow, this is an amazing, amazing, amazing time, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:27.080 --> 09:32.520]  And remember, just a few months ago in May, it came out in the Atlantic, who got a copy
[09:32.520 --> 09:35.720]  of the internal memorandums that are now public.
[09:35.720 --> 09:40.440]  They said, you are not allowed to say Alex Jones' name or have Alex Jones' photo on
[09:40.440 --> 09:47.520]  Facebook or Instagram, owned by Facebook, unless you disparage him.
[09:47.520 --> 09:49.200]  And what happened?
[09:49.200 --> 09:53.360]  Caitlin Bennett got a message last week on July 4th that she would have her account suspended
[09:53.360 --> 10:00.440]  the next time an Alex Jones image or Info Wars image was posted.
[10:00.440 --> 10:05.560]  She was wearing an American, she had an American flag in the background, wearing an Info
[10:05.560 --> 10:12.120]  Wars dot com red, white, and blue shirt.
[10:12.120 --> 10:13.560]  Think about that.
[10:13.560 --> 10:16.640]  And then I had Leo Zagami here last week.
[10:16.640 --> 10:18.720]  He took a photo of himself with me.
[10:18.720 --> 10:21.000]  He posted it on Instagram.
[10:21.000 --> 10:22.600]  Instagram terminated his account.
[10:22.600 --> 10:26.000]  Now that was just in May.
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  He who shall not be named Alex Jones.
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  Now they're expanding it out to everyone.
[10:30.000 --> 10:41.320]  This is the social credit score, and now they're telling you that they can engage in violence
[10:41.320 --> 10:42.320]  against you.
[10:42.320 --> 10:47.680]  Let's put Paul Watson's video back up in his article, please, that has screenshots of
[10:47.680 --> 10:49.560]  all of this.
[10:49.560 --> 10:51.880]  Facebook put a fatwa on me.
[10:51.880 --> 10:53.880]  That's when the Muslims order you dead.
[10:53.880 --> 11:02.480]  And then let's put Paul's article from last night up, it's on info wars dot com, where
[11:02.480 --> 11:11.000]  he lays all of this out.
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.720]  Facebook issues new policies saying it's acceptable to post death threats against me.
[11:15.720 --> 11:21.240]  Yes, really, continuing scrolling down Paul Joseph Watson article.
[11:21.240 --> 11:27.200]  Facebook has issued a new policy update saying it's acceptable to post death threats to
[11:27.200 --> 11:36.200]  incite violence against me or anyone else designated dangerous, despite it being a crime
[11:36.200 --> 11:39.320]  in the United Kingdom.
[11:39.320 --> 11:40.320]  No I'm not joking.
[11:40.320 --> 11:47.480]  The community standards update published by Facebook states, emphasis mine, do not post
[11:47.480 --> 11:56.400]  threats that could lead to death and other forms of high severity violence or any target.
[11:56.400 --> 12:02.800]  Where the threat is defined as any of the following statements of intent to commit high
[12:02.800 --> 12:10.400]  severity violence or calls for high severity violence unless a target is an organization
[12:10.400 --> 12:18.240]  or individual covered in the dangerous individuals and organizations policy.
[12:18.240 --> 12:22.960]  And then they go on to say, then you can make threats that are designed to cause serious
[12:22.960 --> 12:24.120]  harm or death.
[12:24.120 --> 12:25.920]  Did you hear that?
[12:25.920 --> 12:33.800]  I talked to five lawyers this morning, famous well known lawyers that called me panting.
[12:33.800 --> 12:40.160]  One of them said, can you talk to Alan Dershowitz later this afternoon, he wants to talk to you.
[12:40.160 --> 12:43.000]  They said, no one can believe this.
[12:43.000 --> 12:47.040]  They are like the Nazis organizing to kill people.
[12:47.040 --> 12:49.240]  This is so illegal.
[12:49.240 --> 12:53.920]  But see, Facebook already said it may first they said, you cannot post Alex Jones or in
[12:53.920 --> 12:54.920]  full wars.
[12:54.920 --> 12:56.200]  He is the most dangerous category.
[12:56.200 --> 13:04.120]  He has his own category above even Paul Watson or Lewis Farrakhan or all these other people.
[13:04.120 --> 13:09.560]  And they said, gab McGannis, you name it, he's the most dangerous Alex Jones.
[13:09.560 --> 13:11.760]  They said, if you post anything positive, you'll be banned.
[13:11.760 --> 13:14.840]  You can only disparage him or tear him down.
[13:14.840 --> 13:15.840]  Read the policies.
[13:15.840 --> 13:16.840]  I'll read it to you in a moment.
[13:16.840 --> 13:17.840]  Show you the actual policy.
[13:17.840 --> 13:20.200]  Oh, it's private company.
[13:20.200 --> 13:24.960]  Could I as a private company with 2.4 billion users claiming that I have Section 230 immunity
[13:24.960 --> 13:29.840]  because their third party is posting, tell them I want you to attack somebody or I'll
[13:29.840 --> 13:39.000]  let you death threat people and organize people to kill them if they're Alex Jones or Paul
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.400]  Joseph Watson.
[13:41.400 --> 13:42.600]  And I'm glad Paul wrote this article.
[13:42.600 --> 13:47.600]  I'm glad he caught this, but Paul's a smart guy, but he's making about how it's him.
[13:47.600 --> 13:49.760]  Well, then that'll just be what?
[13:49.760 --> 13:57.080]  No, it's the policy towards anyone they designate and the way authoritarian's work is first
[13:57.080 --> 14:01.320]  they designate a few dozen people, then they designate a few thousand and then they just
[14:01.320 --> 14:02.320]  start doing it.
[14:02.320 --> 14:07.440]  This is the global social credit score.
[14:07.440 --> 14:10.080]  This is the reality of this system.
[14:10.080 --> 14:11.720]  This is what's been launched.
[14:11.720 --> 14:13.160]  This is what they're doing.
[14:13.160 --> 14:22.640]  And Trump tomorrow is having his social media conference and every person going there.
[14:22.640 --> 14:23.760]  I know a lot of them.
[14:23.760 --> 14:26.320]  I'm going to get on the phone today and say, listen, this isn't about me.
[14:26.320 --> 14:31.800]  And I'm going to rewrite, I'm going to article rewritten about how Facebook says conservatives
[14:31.800 --> 14:36.320]  can be killed and the promotion of killing conservatives is kosher because I'm telling
[14:36.320 --> 14:40.440]  other media works, they're going to pick this up and say, Oh, they're saying you can kill
[14:40.440 --> 14:41.440]  Paul Watson.
[14:41.440 --> 14:43.400]  There's and they'll go, that's okay.
[14:43.400 --> 14:49.040]  No, they're saying whoever Facebook designates, then people can commit crime.
[14:49.040 --> 14:53.600]  Facebook doesn't have the authorization to tell people they can commit crimes under section
[14:53.600 --> 14:54.600]  230.
[14:54.600 --> 15:00.120]  The only things they have to remove are people calling for violence or organizing it and naming
[15:00.120 --> 15:07.000]  names and telling people to kill somebody or selling drugs or illegal pornography or
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  gambling.
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  It was regulated in that country.
[15:10.000 --> 15:11.000]  That's it.
[15:11.000 --> 15:14.640]  The digital millennium copyright, safe harbor act, all of it.
[15:14.640 --> 15:15.720]  I know the law.
[15:15.720 --> 15:19.200]  I run in multimedia operations.
[15:19.200 --> 15:24.920]  But they're saying, no, in this gulag, you can target these people and get promoted.
[15:24.920 --> 15:27.400]  That's why the media all attacks me and lies about me.
[15:27.400 --> 15:33.240]  And my AP said that I lost a Sandy Hook lawsuit for a book I've never read saying I wrote
[15:33.240 --> 15:37.560]  it or why they said I'm sending child porn out when I'm not because they know they're
[15:37.560 --> 15:41.080]  protected and they've been given orders by the deep state to go for broke.
[15:41.080 --> 15:42.680]  And what does this signify?
[15:42.680 --> 15:44.960]  They're getting ready for a violent revolution.
[15:44.960 --> 15:46.760]  Antifa is their operating system.
[15:46.760 --> 15:48.360]  The media is run by Antifa.
[15:48.360 --> 15:51.360]  Big tech isn't in bed with Antifa.
[15:51.360 --> 15:52.360]  You understand?
[15:52.360 --> 15:54.920]  This is Antifa getting ready to make their move.
[15:54.920 --> 15:56.080]  They're going to kill thousands.
[15:56.080 --> 15:58.320]  They're coming to kill you.
[15:58.320 --> 16:00.720]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[16:00.720 --> 16:04.640]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:04.640 --> 16:06.200]  I sued the IRS in one.
[16:06.200 --> 16:09.160]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:09.160 --> 16:12.440]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[16:12.440 --> 16:14.680]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[16:14.680 --> 16:16.000]  I can help you too.
[16:16.000 --> 16:19.040]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[16:25.760 --> 16:29.360]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.

[16:49.040 --> 16:50.040]  off the grid.
[16:50.040 --> 16:53.940]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the East
[16:53.940 --> 16:55.440]  Bank of the Mississippi.
[16:55.440 --> 16:59.240]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[16:59.240 --> 17:03.000]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[17:03.000 --> 17:07.360]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:07.360 --> 17:13.000]  So here's what you should do right now, check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.

[18:01.680 --> 18:02.680]  Marcus here on the air.
[18:02.680 --> 18:03.680]  Thanks for holding.
[18:03.680 --> 18:04.680]  Hey Alex.
[18:04.680 --> 18:06.360]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[18:06.360 --> 18:10.280]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that
[18:10.280 --> 18:12.480]  almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[18:12.480 --> 18:16.880]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[18:16.880 --> 18:21.160]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching
[18:21.160 --> 18:22.160]  2020.
[18:22.160 --> 18:23.160]  That's it.
[18:23.160 --> 18:25.240]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[18:25.240 --> 18:28.040]  It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him.
[18:28.040 --> 18:29.360]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[18:29.360 --> 18:30.360]  I agree entirely.
[18:30.360 --> 18:33.520]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[18:33.520 --> 18:35.480]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[18:35.480 --> 18:38.440]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[18:38.440 --> 18:40.680]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[18:40.680 --> 18:43.920]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[18:43.920 --> 18:48.520]  You've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others
[18:48.520 --> 18:49.840]  who are going to continue.
[18:49.840 --> 18:51.760]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War.
[18:51.760 --> 18:55.800]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten
[18:55.800 --> 18:58.240]  a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[18:58.240 --> 19:04.520]  Thank you, sir, for calling 1776 worldwide.
[19:04.520 --> 19:07.640]  That's a term I coined 15 years ago.
[19:07.640 --> 19:08.640]  What does it really mean?
[19:08.640 --> 19:13.880]  It means the idea of American freedom renaissance worldwide doesn't mean we go conquer.
[19:13.880 --> 19:14.880]  We conquer countries.
[19:14.880 --> 19:22.360]  It means our superior Western values of true freedom get adopted because compared to globalism,
[19:22.360 --> 19:23.360]  it's night and day.
[19:23.360 --> 19:30.360]  We're going to do a 34 hour special broadcast that kicks off this Thursday morning at 8 a.m.
[19:30.360 --> 19:35.600]  with David Knight, runs right through with me and many others till the next day at 6
[19:35.600 --> 19:37.080]  p.m. on the war room.
[19:37.080 --> 19:42.160]  We're going to have our crew in DC at the White House summit on social media.
[19:42.160 --> 19:46.120]  We're going to be at the after party with all the key folks taking action against censorship
[19:46.120 --> 19:47.360]  and so much more.
[19:47.360 --> 19:52.720]  So everybody share that link info wars dot com forward slash show kicking off this Thursday
[19:52.720 --> 20:03.560]  at 8 a.m. central at info wars dot com forward slash show 1776 worldwide.
[20:03.560 --> 20:30.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:30.360 --> 20:37.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we knew the left was pushing for a hot war.
[20:37.040 --> 20:42.120]  You've got all these members of Congress calling for the arrest of conservatives for our speech.
[20:42.120 --> 20:48.840]  Facebook in its official terms of service has now called for its users to call for the
[20:48.840 --> 20:56.360]  murder of conservatives and others to call for violence, to call for organized targeting.
[20:56.360 --> 21:01.640]  They say you're not allowed to do that unless it's someone listed as a dangerous individual.
[21:01.640 --> 21:07.520]  And when you're listed as a dangerous individual by Facebook in the hate designation, then
[21:07.520 --> 21:10.040]  your name is not allowed to be spoken in a positive way.
[21:10.040 --> 21:12.240]  Your photo cannot be posted.
[21:12.240 --> 21:17.960]  Your website not posted total Chinese social score beyond 94 beyond the black mirror episode
[21:17.960 --> 21:20.040]  unless you disparage them.
[21:20.040 --> 21:28.120]  So organized criminal bullying by the 2.4 billion members.
[21:28.120 --> 21:32.480]  This is terrorism against the American people.
[21:32.480 --> 21:36.160]  And this is what happens when our government has it protected us and allows the communist
[21:36.160 --> 21:43.240]  Chinese and the EU and others to come in and put in regulations so that Facebook and Google
[21:43.240 --> 21:45.280]  and Apple can move to China.
[21:45.280 --> 21:50.000]  And then by extension, we go under the Chinese social credit score.
[21:50.000 --> 21:56.720]  Let me read to you from the Atlantic magazine two months ago, then I'll get to the new developments.
[21:56.720 --> 22:02.200]  Any content, this is from Facebook and Instagram, that shares InfoWars content will see it removed
[22:02.200 --> 22:08.280]  unless the post is explicitly condemning InfoWars Facebook and Instagram will remove any content
[22:08.280 --> 22:12.560]  containing InfoWars videos, radio segments or articles unless the post is explicitly
[22:12.560 --> 22:14.680]  condemning the content.
[22:14.680 --> 22:19.080]  And Facebook will also remove any groups set up to share InfoWars content and events promoting
[22:19.080 --> 22:23.920]  any of the banned extremist figures according to the company, Spokesperson, Twitter, YouTube,
[22:23.920 --> 22:28.640]  Apple have also banned Jones and they're all linking up and then saying, oh, we better
[22:28.640 --> 22:33.160]  get rid of Paul Watson, which they now have or we better get rid of other people.
[22:33.160 --> 22:35.720]  They are just copycats of Jones.
[22:35.720 --> 22:39.120]  You know, they believe in Second Amendment, they believe in two genders, they believe
[22:39.120 --> 22:44.000]  in borders, they believe in free market, they believe in the right to live your life as you
[22:44.000 --> 22:45.000]  see fit.
[22:45.000 --> 22:53.320]  And the authoritarians can't put up with that, well, now, ladies and gentlemen, what have
[22:53.320 --> 22:54.320]  they done?
[22:54.320 --> 23:02.440]  The article's up on infowars.com, newswars.com and Paul Sight's summit.news.
[23:02.440 --> 23:06.120]  Facebook issues new policy saying it's acceptable to post death threats against me.
[23:06.120 --> 23:07.120]  They've issued a fatwa.
[23:07.120 --> 23:12.960]  That's what the Muslims do, they say, we're not going to charge you if you kill this person,
[23:12.960 --> 23:15.560]  in fact, we're going to promote you.
[23:15.560 --> 23:19.320]  And they say, oh, you can't organize people or docks them or call for violence unless
[23:19.320 --> 23:22.160]  it's someone we've listed as a dangerous individual.
[23:22.160 --> 23:29.720]  Remember three months ago, Business Insider got internal email communications with Facebook
[23:29.720 --> 23:34.680]  executives saying, well, we haven't found Jones doing anything anti-Semitic and we scanned
[23:34.680 --> 23:42.520]  all the comments on his pages and 4% were anti-Semitic, that's to be 30%, which is still
[23:42.520 --> 23:46.640]  police state weirdness, obviously the shills can go in there and do it themselves, a bunch
[23:46.640 --> 23:53.280]  of Jesse Smallening, they said, but if we designate him as a hate figure, so they hadn't
[23:53.280 --> 23:55.760]  rolled that policy, I think, oh, let's do that.
[23:55.760 --> 24:06.240]  And so they did, when they did it, they said it was for anti-Semitism, wow, you don't like
[24:06.240 --> 24:11.360]  George Soros funding open borders and he happens to be Jewish, doesn't matter, he helped round
[24:11.360 --> 24:16.120]  up his fellow Jews in World War II, you are bad.
[24:16.120 --> 24:22.520]  Wow, talk about the country that defeated Hitler.
[24:22.520 --> 24:28.320]  And now the grandsons and people of the folks that flew B-17s over Germany and almost died,
[24:28.320 --> 24:35.240]  both my grandfathers, I get to have weirdo billionaire Jewish guys have me silencing
[24:35.240 --> 24:41.720]  on anti-Semitic and then the weirdo billionaire Jewish guy actually worked for Hitler, it's
[24:41.720 --> 24:44.520]  all part of the sick joke, isn't it?
[24:44.520 --> 24:51.440]  Do not post threats that could lead to death and other forms of high severity violence
[24:51.440 --> 24:57.000]  of any targets where the threat is defined as any of the following, statements of intent
[24:57.000 --> 25:02.000]  to commit high severity violence or calls for high severity violence unless the target
[25:02.000 --> 25:08.560]  is an organization individual covered in the dangerous individuals and organizations policy
[25:08.560 --> 25:14.080]  or as described as carried out violent crimes or sexual offenses, whereas criminal predator
[25:14.080 --> 25:19.880]  status has been established by media reports, market knowledge, news events, etc.
[25:19.880 --> 25:24.080]  So they're saying, wow, you're not even supposed to call for violence or say kill somebody
[25:24.080 --> 25:28.480]  who's a wanted murderer, you can say I hope they get the electric chair, this is saying
[25:28.480 --> 25:34.600]  if we call you dangerous, don't have a crime, have a committed crime, that's in with child
[25:34.600 --> 25:38.560]  molesters or murderers, see, it's a death sentence.
[25:38.560 --> 25:41.800]  And so they're saying if you're one of these dangerous individuals which they've listed
[25:41.800 --> 25:50.320]  me as, well now you can call for their death, now you can go out and kill them but see when
[25:50.320 --> 25:59.600]  you do go out and kill somebody, you're gonna end up going to prison but see Antifa is operated
[25:59.600 --> 26:07.320]  and is staffed and is commanded by government employees, academics and others and the main
[26:07.320 --> 26:12.880]  funder is Alexander Soros who spent billions, that's public knowledge, George Soros' son,
[26:12.880 --> 26:18.400]  he's taken over and so they're creating the policies for Silicon Valley, that's why you
[26:18.400 --> 26:23.600]  can never talk bad about Antifa, they'll ban you and so Antifa is now setting the policy
[26:23.600 --> 26:30.760]  saying when we list you as a Nazi, it's okay to kill a Nazi, not just punch a Nazi.
[26:30.760 --> 26:36.840]  So they have CBS news shows about go out and hit white people, go out and hit people that
[26:36.840 --> 26:42.920]  support Trump, they're all Nazis, they dehumanize you, they list you as an enemy, they have
[26:42.920 --> 26:48.760]  all these photos and graphics of stabbing Americans with make America great again hats
[26:48.760 --> 26:53.920]  to death, with Bayonets saying we beat them before, we can beat them again but they're
[26:53.920 --> 27:00.160]  actually financed by a real live Nazi, George Soros, CBS drama the good fight, also said
[27:00.160 --> 27:08.040]  assassinate the president, they didn't just say go and punch a Trump supporter but see
[27:08.040 --> 27:11.520]  here's the good thing about it, you're not gonna get our guns, the second amendment's
[27:11.520 --> 27:16.040]  here for when these things happen, we're not gonna offensively come after you trash, here's
[27:16.040 --> 27:20.840]  what's gonna happen, you can't help it, we're culturally taking things back, we're turning
[27:20.840 --> 27:25.360]  the country back on, Trump's ending the corruption, he's even getting rid of the ethanol subsidies
[27:25.360 --> 27:31.120]  to corn growers, which is a total scam, Trump is for real, straight shooting and the big
[27:31.120 --> 27:37.240]  mega banks think they're gonna activate a bunch of people on the streets and others
[27:37.240 --> 27:42.840]  who go out and carry out violence and start a civil war, I assure you, Alexander Soros,
[27:42.840 --> 27:48.600]  George Soros, the Democratic Party, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook, all of you calling for violence,
[27:48.600 --> 27:56.600]  Joe Biden say it's time for a physical revolution, I swear on the altar of God because I know,
[27:56.600 --> 28:02.760]  you show the wind, you're gonna reap the whirlwind, you are sticking your leg in a bear trap,
[28:02.760 --> 28:07.080]  you're climbing into a woodchipper and flipping the switch on, you're doing it, you're doing
[28:07.080 --> 28:13.520]  it, you're the one that silences us or tries and then lies about us and demonizes us and
[28:13.520 --> 28:19.640]  then says, kill us, it always goes the same, silence someone, lie about them and demonize
[28:19.640 --> 28:30.240]  them, kill them, silence them, lie about them, imprison them, kill them, of course most of
[28:30.240 --> 28:34.800]  the time, especially in the country and people of any history of fighting back, you get your
[28:34.800 --> 28:40.560]  asses handed to you, you're not trying to carry this out in countries that didn't have
[28:40.560 --> 28:45.760]  history of freedom, you are out of your crazy minds, but hey, you're gonna find out in your

[31:00.320 --> 31:03.760]  The second American revolution is happening now.

[31:09.440 --> 31:10.440]  world government.

[33:03.040 --> 33:10.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:10.520 --> 33:14.560]  Facebook and Instagram banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[33:14.560 --> 33:15.880]  I am now completely banned.
[33:15.880 --> 33:24.960]  AlphaWars, of course, is that web show and website led by Rachel Hall and Alex Jones.
[33:24.960 --> 33:28.800]  These people aren't terrifying or anything, but there's also guys on CNN that spend their
[33:28.800 --> 33:32.800]  whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[33:32.800 --> 33:36.800]  These are very extreme individuals and no matter what anyone tells you, they are extremists
[33:36.800 --> 33:39.920]  and that's why Facebook decided to get rid of them.
[33:39.920 --> 33:43.840]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous is what Facebook is saying.
[33:43.840 --> 33:47.960]  Those individuals include people like right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[33:47.960 --> 33:52.760]  Organizations like Media Matters have pointed out consistently how Alex Jones and other
[33:52.760 --> 33:59.320]  info wars pages had just simply circumvented any ban by starting a different account or
[33:59.320 --> 34:00.320]  going on Instagram.
[34:00.320 --> 34:04.600]  If you don't like someone on Facebook, don't follow them, it's not that hard to figure
[34:04.600 --> 34:05.600]  out.
[34:05.600 --> 34:08.520]  Facebook, are you going to do something about the liberals who call me the n-word?
[34:08.520 --> 34:13.000]  No, because big tech is only interested in going after conservatives.
[34:13.000 --> 34:14.560]  You know, the really dangerous ones.
[34:14.560 --> 34:17.920]  Dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like.
[34:17.920 --> 34:22.120]  President Trump retweeted Paul Joseph Watson twice and a brief video by Infowars Millie
[34:22.120 --> 34:26.760]  Weaver, social media's hall monitor, Frank Stelter, was not very happy about it.
[34:26.760 --> 34:30.200]  He is promoting the same alternative universe as Infowars.
[34:30.200 --> 34:34.400]  Back to your point though about the Infowars presidency, I want to know and I tweeted this
[34:34.400 --> 34:40.120]  all the day, what is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and Infowars.com?
[34:40.120 --> 34:42.680]  Infowars content is useful to him.
[34:42.680 --> 34:45.080]  Infowars personalities align with them.
[34:45.080 --> 34:49.040]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted, I think they are horrible
[34:49.040 --> 34:50.040]  for our society.
[34:50.040 --> 34:54.280]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted.
[34:54.280 --> 35:15.840]  Don't worry, these people aren't terrifying or anything.
[35:15.840 --> 35:22.600]  I'm going to say something that is as critical as it gets if you want to live in a free country
[35:22.600 --> 35:29.680]  and not be a slave of the nastiest, most evil control freaks the planet has ever seen.
[35:29.680 --> 35:37.240]  Tyrants and corrupt political systems test things and they push slowly and incrementally
[35:37.240 --> 35:40.920]  and they'll see what you'll put up with and they'll pick certain individuals and certain
[35:40.920 --> 35:45.960]  groups that they've demonized to then target and take their rights away.
[35:45.960 --> 35:49.640]  And then once they've taken those people's rights away, they take everybody's rights
[35:49.640 --> 35:51.040]  away.
[35:51.040 --> 35:56.160]  All this Facebook and Google and YouTube and Twitter censorship is about taking all your
[35:56.160 --> 36:01.320]  rights away and it's about if you don't say and do what they want, they have a social
[36:01.320 --> 36:06.680]  credit score and take your bank account away or take your job away or not let you travel.
[36:06.680 --> 36:08.600]  They admit that's the plan.
[36:08.600 --> 36:15.360]  We told you seven years ago about this at Infowars.com on this show and articles that
[36:15.360 --> 36:18.000]  Paul Joseph Watson wrote.
[36:18.000 --> 36:26.360]  Now, a year ago, they listed me as a evil person and worked to be platforming off of
[36:26.360 --> 36:29.080]  dozens of systems.
[36:29.080 --> 36:34.720]  Then a few months ago, they said you can't even say nice things about Alex Jones or Paul
[36:34.720 --> 36:37.120]  Watson or just a few other people.
[36:37.120 --> 36:39.440]  We call them dangerous individuals.
[36:39.440 --> 36:46.640]  Now they have said that people can call for violence and organize violence that's intended
[36:46.640 --> 36:48.240]  to kill us.
[36:48.240 --> 36:49.760]  I read the quotes from it.
[36:49.760 --> 36:51.720]  This is official policy.
[36:51.720 --> 36:53.320]  This is Antifa.
[36:53.320 --> 36:54.320]  That's who runs Silicon Valley.
[36:54.320 --> 36:56.200]  That's why they're so protective.
[36:56.200 --> 36:59.960]  Big media, Antifa, all of them.
[36:59.960 --> 37:03.320]  Paul Joseph Watson discovered this and discovered that they're allowing death threats against
[37:03.320 --> 37:08.480]  him and specifically said, no, you're allowed to, he's a bad man.
[37:08.480 --> 37:12.200]  Well, that violates UK law, it violates US law.
[37:12.200 --> 37:16.600]  I had five lawyers call me this morning, high-powered ones, and say, we've never heard
[37:16.600 --> 37:20.440]  of something like this.
[37:20.440 --> 37:22.160]  They said this is incitement to violence.
[37:22.160 --> 37:26.760]  It's organized crime and it's implying that you can commit crimes and not get in trouble
[37:26.760 --> 37:32.000]  and it violates section 230 because they're saying that, well, we're not a publisher.
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.360]  We don't control content, but they're going further.
[37:34.360 --> 37:41.520]  This is the type of content that under section 230, you do have to remove threats of violence.
[37:41.520 --> 37:43.280]  So Paul Watson joins us for the next two segments.
[37:43.280 --> 37:48.280]  And Roger Stone's got the inside baseball on Jeffrey Epstein and this whole house of
[37:48.280 --> 37:51.520]  cards coming down fast that's going to bring down the Democrats.
[37:51.520 --> 37:56.440]  You watch and so much more.
[37:56.440 --> 38:03.080]  We also have some other critical intel I haven't gotten to yet, but Paul, I got to tell you.
[38:03.080 --> 38:07.680]  What was it like for you when you discovered this new change of terms of policy and we're
[38:07.680 --> 38:12.120]  reading it right there at Facebook that people are allowed to dox you, they're allowed to
[38:12.120 --> 38:17.320]  say kill you, they're allowed to do things calculated to get others to murder you and
[38:17.320 --> 38:18.320]  murder me.
[38:18.320 --> 38:20.640]  I mean, this is next level.
[38:20.640 --> 38:26.280]  Well, nothing really shocks me at this point, but there are a few things that give you pause
[38:26.280 --> 38:27.280]  for thought.
[38:27.280 --> 38:33.040]  I originally saw it on some different independent media reports websites and I thought surely
[38:33.040 --> 38:34.040]  that can't be the case.
[38:34.040 --> 38:40.720]  Surely they wouldn't legitimize inciting what they call high severity violence against
[38:40.720 --> 38:44.240]  me against you against Milo Nopoulos against Laura Luma.
[38:44.240 --> 38:46.480]  And yes, it's right there on their website.
[38:46.480 --> 38:51.960]  I thought, well, maybe after the backlash this morning, they'll rework it, they'll change
[38:51.960 --> 38:52.960]  it.
[38:52.960 --> 38:55.680]  But no, it's still there and it's still going to be there.
[38:55.680 --> 39:01.080]  And it states that if somebody is a dangerous individual, which you and I are now according
[39:01.080 --> 39:07.600]  to Facebook with no evidence, they just decided that that it's acceptable to post threats
[39:07.600 --> 39:12.680]  of an intent to commit high severity violence against us.
[39:12.680 --> 39:19.360]  Now that is supposedly designed to allow people to say, oh, I want to kill this pedophile
[39:19.360 --> 39:23.320]  or I want to kill this ISIS jihadist, right?
[39:23.320 --> 39:24.680]  That's what it's designed to do.
[39:24.680 --> 39:29.200]  But where on the same list as them, where equally as bad in Facebook size.
[39:29.200 --> 39:30.600]  So this is a cult.
[39:30.600 --> 39:37.040]  This is a violent extremist cult now in Facebook with two billion plus users on the planet
[39:37.040 --> 39:42.920]  openly inciting its followers, its users to break laws in virtually every developed
[39:42.920 --> 39:43.920]  country.
[39:43.920 --> 39:49.840]  This is illegal to go on there and break laws and incite violent hatred against us.
[39:49.840 --> 39:55.960]  They lecture us all day, Alex Facebook, about how they want to stop hate and make the internet
[39:55.960 --> 39:59.000]  a safer, secure and better place.
[39:59.000 --> 40:06.040]  They are openly inciting the most violent hate imaginable against anyone that Mark Zuckerberg
[40:06.040 --> 40:07.160]  doesn't like.
[40:07.160 --> 40:09.400]  How Orwellian does it need to get?
[40:09.400 --> 40:15.520]  They don't even have this yet in communist China and we have it here in the West.
[40:15.520 --> 40:20.240]  Salman Rushdie, 20 something years ago, wrote the satanic verses and Iran put out a Fada
[40:20.240 --> 40:22.520]  what I had him killed.
[40:22.520 --> 40:26.200]  This is literal Fada was on us and it's just done like it's no big deal.
[40:26.200 --> 40:30.120]  And all of the news suddenly Democrats are saying, let's get physical, let's get violent,
[40:30.120 --> 40:32.960]  let's shut them up, let's arrest people that criticize us.
[40:32.960 --> 40:38.600]  They are preparing their people to not just confront us at the gas station or at the restaurant
[40:38.600 --> 40:44.520]  or the department store like Maxine said last year, they are gearing up to kill us.
[40:44.520 --> 40:47.240]  I mean, this is unbelievable, Paul.
[40:47.240 --> 40:48.240]  Exactly.
[40:48.240 --> 40:54.440]  And they're not just focusing it on public figures like ourselves, remember the Daily
[40:54.440 --> 40:59.320]  Beast did an article, I think it was last month or the month before about the black
[40:59.320 --> 41:06.280]  forklift truck driver who created the Nancy Pelosi parody video, okay, Facebook doxxed
[41:06.280 --> 41:12.560]  him, gave his info to the Daily Beast so they could do a hit piece on him, expose him and
[41:12.560 --> 41:13.560]  doxx him.
[41:13.560 --> 41:15.240]  That's where this is going.
[41:15.240 --> 41:18.680]  They beta tested on us and now they're going to tear people apart.
[41:18.680 --> 41:23.040]  The average person to teach everybody, you keep your damn mouth shut or we'll send a
[41:23.040 --> 41:28.040]  mob to your house to kill your ass like they send armed mobs to Tommy Robinson's house.
[41:28.040 --> 41:29.040]  Precisely.
[41:29.040 --> 41:32.080]  It's not like, isn't it enough to just banners?
[41:32.080 --> 41:33.080]  No, it's not enough.
[41:33.080 --> 41:38.240]  They literally have to incite violent hate mobs to come and take us out.
[41:38.240 --> 41:41.160]  And by the way, they've got a list of hate agents.
[41:41.160 --> 41:45.680]  They have different levels before you get banned and you get on their hate agent list
[41:45.680 --> 41:51.760]  and you get on that list, as you've mentioned earlier, one way to do so is not just by praising
[41:51.760 --> 41:54.480]  Tommy Robinson myself or Alex Jones.
[41:54.480 --> 42:00.480]  It says literally, and they got the leaked documents reporting neutrally on any of the
[42:00.480 --> 42:03.040]  people that they've got on their dangerous persons list.
[42:03.040 --> 42:09.240]  So doing basic straightforward journalism is now against Facebook's rules and terms
[42:09.240 --> 42:14.600]  and will get you put on their hate agent list, which could eventually get you put on their
[42:14.600 --> 42:18.640]  dangerous persons list and have violent hatred incited against you.
[42:18.640 --> 42:22.720]  So this is a giant organized criminal racketeering mafia.
[42:22.720 --> 42:27.600]  You get 10 or 15 members of the mafia in New York harassing shops, threatening them, talking
[42:27.600 --> 42:28.600]  bad about them.
[42:28.600 --> 42:30.880]  They would get busted for organized crime practices.
[42:30.880 --> 42:34.680]  This is actual organized crime practices, Paul.
[42:34.680 --> 42:35.680]  Completely.
[42:35.680 --> 42:36.880]  You want to talk about harm.
[42:36.880 --> 42:37.880]  You want to talk about threats.
[42:37.880 --> 42:42.920]  I mean, people like Laura Luma have, you know, she got kicked off there for basically disagreeing
[42:42.920 --> 42:45.120]  with a G-Hadis group.
[42:45.120 --> 42:46.960]  Those people have already sent threats against her.
[42:46.960 --> 42:48.160]  I get death threats on Facebook.
[42:48.160 --> 42:50.000]  I did all the time when I was on it.
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.360]  So it's not as if people aren't willing to carry this through.
[42:52.360 --> 42:55.240]  Oh, they're going to use Facebook to organize our murder.
[42:55.240 --> 42:56.240]  It's a weapon system.
[42:56.240 --> 43:00.040]  Well, they're out there.
[43:00.040 --> 43:01.680]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[43:01.680 --> 43:03.840]  A Big Tech or Big Babies that have become big bullies.
[43:03.840 --> 43:07.880]  And the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social, economic, political
[43:07.880 --> 43:10.520]  or legal for their illicit activities over two decades.
[43:10.520 --> 43:13.880]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the
[43:13.880 --> 43:17.200]  independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the
[43:17.200 --> 43:21.480]  audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[43:21.480 --> 43:22.720]  to their course of conduct.
[43:22.720 --> 43:23.720]  Otherwise they will never change.
[43:23.720 --> 43:27.800]  And they will become the Big Tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th
[43:27.800 --> 43:31.720]  century, who ran American politics and ran American economy, almost into the ground until
[43:31.720 --> 43:33.680]  we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[43:33.680 --> 43:38.840]  The infamous audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make
[43:38.840 --> 43:43.600]  real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent
[43:43.600 --> 43:44.600]  free press.
[43:44.600 --> 43:49.000]  Real collusion is Big Tech and Big Media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.800]  with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole
[43:52.800 --> 43:53.800]  time it's not happening.
[43:53.800 --> 43:55.800]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[43:55.800 --> 43:57.760]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[43:57.760 --> 44:01.480]  Even it is what you just saw.
[44:01.480 --> 44:06.240]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.
[44:06.240 --> 44:10.880]  That's why we created the 8-Pack PowerStack, your go-to option for the building blocks
[44:10.880 --> 44:13.880]  of a successful approach to supplementation.
[44:13.880 --> 44:18.560]  This one-stop shop for those looking to simplify or adjust their routine is perfect for new
[44:18.560 --> 44:21.480]  and old info warriors alike.
[44:21.480 --> 44:25.720]  With the 8-Pack PowerStack, there's no trial and error, messy bottles laying across the
[44:25.720 --> 44:29.360]  counter or 20-minute morning habits.

[45:32.680 --> 45:37.000]  many others until the next day at 6 p.m. on the war room.
[45:37.000 --> 45:42.080]  We're going to have our crew in D.C. at the White House Summit on social media.
[45:42.080 --> 45:46.040]  We're going to be at the after party with all the key folks taking action against censorship
[45:46.040 --> 45:47.280]  and so much more.
[45:47.280 --> 45:52.560]  So everybody, share that link, infowars.com forward slash show, kicking off this Thursday
[45:52.560 --> 46:00.560]  at 8 a.m. central at infowars.com forward slash show, 1776 worldwide.
[46:00.560 --> 46:07.360]  As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom, we remember that all share a truly extraordinary
[46:07.360 --> 46:08.360]  heritage.
[46:08.360 --> 46:14.080]  Together, we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America.
[46:14.080 --> 46:20.200]  It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they
[46:20.200 --> 46:24.600]  know is right and what they know is true.
[46:24.600 --> 46:31.000]  As long as we stay true to our codes, as long as we remember our great history, as long
[46:31.000 --> 46:38.320]  as we never, ever stop fighting for a better future, then there will be nothing that America
[46:38.320 --> 47:07.600]  can not do.
[47:08.320 --> 47:30.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going right back to Paul Joseph Watson.
[47:30.300 --> 47:34.480]  Then you saw Tommy Robinson's story linked up on theRubberPort.com, then you picked up
[47:34.480 --> 47:39.400]  by hundreds of major publications that tried to spin and lie what's happening to Tommy.
[47:39.400 --> 47:45.960]  Tommy's been found guilty by judges, not juries, of civil disobedience basically.
[47:45.960 --> 47:48.720]  The law says you can't even spend jail time for it.
[47:48.720 --> 47:54.720]  He's facing three years, two to three years in solitary confinement, could be sent tomorrow.
[47:54.720 --> 47:58.880]  He's spending final hours with his children and his wife right now, but he was live with
[47:58.880 --> 48:04.880]  David Knight, extremely powerful interview this morning that we're going to air at the
[48:04.880 --> 48:06.640]  bottom of the next hour.
[48:06.640 --> 48:10.560]  Roger Stone will join us for several segments to talk about Jeffrey Epstein.
[48:10.560 --> 48:13.480]  He wrote a whole book about it, Clinton's War on Women.
[48:13.480 --> 48:15.480]  Talked about Epstein, he has the inside baseball.
[48:15.480 --> 48:21.560]  They don't want you to hear that is coming up briefly here, ladies and gentlemen, 1776
[48:21.560 --> 48:23.360]  Worldwide Specials.

[48:27.600 --> 48:35.040]  trying to kick us off the internet, then demonize us, imprison us, I mean, you see what they're
[48:35.040 --> 48:36.040]  doing.
[48:36.040 --> 48:37.040]  This is a real war.
[48:37.040 --> 48:38.800]  You are the target.

[49:40.040 --> 49:42.840]  We'll have some new ones, but it takes a lot of money to find this operation.
[49:42.840 --> 49:47.160]  We've got a lot of other operations going on that obviously folks don't know about
[49:47.160 --> 49:51.600]  to circumnavigate the platforming.
[49:51.600 --> 49:54.320]  InfowarsStore.com, this is the second American Revolution.
[49:54.320 --> 49:58.280]  Don't sit there on the sidelines, get involved, want to thank all of you that have been involved.
[49:58.280 --> 50:06.200]  Again, InfowarsStore.com or AAA-253-3139 or simply as I said, go to InfowarsLife.com,
[50:06.200 --> 50:07.920]  it's your right to the supplements.
[50:07.920 --> 50:12.520]  Paul Watson, I want people to understand this is not about us.
[50:12.520 --> 50:14.680]  This is the global social credit score.
[50:14.680 --> 50:20.200]  It's here, they're moving, they're doing it and you know, Trump is just now starting
[50:20.200 --> 50:24.360]  to figure out this is happening, he has this summit tomorrow and what it really is is like
[50:24.360 --> 50:28.400]  kettling like the police do, one of the producers pointed out, like where they get a group of
[50:28.400 --> 50:31.000]  protesters and put them into a confined area.
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.280]  Well, we're being taken off the web so we can't respond, we have our own platforms we
[50:35.280 --> 50:39.560]  built smartly, so they're trying to shut those down, they're lying about us and now
[50:39.560 --> 50:41.400]  they want us killed.
[50:41.400 --> 50:42.400]  Now they want us killed.
[50:42.400 --> 50:46.680]  I mean, they're saying in terms of service, recapping that, that this is what they want.
[50:46.680 --> 50:49.280]  This has been premeditated, this is a big deal.
[50:49.280 --> 50:50.280]  This is so dangerous.
[50:50.280 --> 50:54.360]  A, they, by calling us dangerous, they lump us in with murderers and people, but even
[50:54.360 --> 50:58.800]  murderers or whatever, you shouldn't say people have a right to go kill.
[50:58.800 --> 51:02.720]  They are becoming judge, jury and executioner, Zuckerberg's coming out with his own global
[51:02.720 --> 51:05.520]  digital cashless currency.
[51:05.520 --> 51:09.080]  They're setting up these weird communal rooms where you can't have a Facebook unless everyone
[51:09.080 --> 51:11.120]  else is allowed in your info.
[51:11.120 --> 51:16.280]  He's training everyone to officially let Facebook rape them.
[51:16.280 --> 51:20.200]  They've gone completely power mad, Alex.
[51:20.200 --> 51:24.960]  It is a cult as proven by what you're talking about earlier.
[51:24.960 --> 51:29.880]  You cannot even mention or wear an info wars t-shirt on their platforms anymore without
[51:29.880 --> 51:35.280]  denouncing it, even reporting neutrally on it, they will get rid of you.
[51:35.280 --> 51:36.760]  They've completely jumped the shot.
[51:36.760 --> 51:42.320]  Oh, and by the way, the Antifa group that cracked two people's skulls in Portland a
[51:42.320 --> 51:47.920]  couple of weeks ago, the, um, put cement in milkshakes and threw them at journalists
[51:47.920 --> 51:50.480]  two weeks ago, they're still on Facebook.
[51:50.480 --> 51:53.160]  It's called Rose City Antifa.
[51:53.160 --> 51:58.440]  Joe Biggs got banned on Twitter after he posted the images of, um, that guy with his head
[51:58.440 --> 51:59.720]  cracked open.
[51:59.720 --> 52:05.760]  The guy who posted the video of that violent attack by a domestic terrorist group, his
[52:05.760 --> 52:06.760]  video got deleted.
[52:06.760 --> 52:12.480]  In fact, I think he got banned on Twitter as well, the very group behind the violence,
[52:12.480 --> 52:17.600]  Rose City Antifa is still on Facebook and is still on Twitter.
[52:17.600 --> 52:22.440]  The group that doxxed, harassed, threatened, took a Colson's family, showed up at his
[52:22.440 --> 52:25.800]  house, banged on his door, they're still on Twitter.
[52:25.800 --> 52:29.440]  So I mean, I'm kind of blackpilled at this point, Alex, they've got this social media
[52:29.440 --> 52:30.440]  summit.
[52:30.440 --> 52:31.440]  I wasn't invited.
[52:31.440 --> 52:32.440]  You weren't invited.
[52:32.440 --> 52:36.800]  Everybody from what I've seen, who's been actually banned on any social media platform
[52:36.800 --> 52:38.040]  was invited.
[52:38.040 --> 52:43.240]  They set up a website where people could whine about it and send an email to a black hole.
[52:43.240 --> 52:47.040]  So I'm really beyond the point of having any hope in that.
[52:47.040 --> 52:50.640]  I do have hope in our listeners, our audience, as you said, because they've stood behind
[52:50.640 --> 52:52.960]  us at every single point.
[52:52.960 --> 52:58.200]  So it will just go back to the olden days, Alex, it will go back to analog, newsletters,
[52:58.200 --> 53:03.160]  websites, and people staying on that home turf, buying the products and supporting us
[53:03.160 --> 53:04.160]  that way.
[53:04.160 --> 53:07.160]  That's the only way we're going to survive because everything else is going to go away.
[53:07.160 --> 53:10.560]  And by the way, Paul, we got here with shortwave radio and fax machines.
[53:10.560 --> 53:13.880]  The old Soviet Union was overthrown that way, but let's be clear, Trump has good instincts
[53:13.880 --> 53:15.120]  and wants to change this.
[53:15.120 --> 53:21.440]  He's surrounded by sycophantic cowards who the media said one thing about Ben Garrison,
[53:21.440 --> 53:26.600]  the most successful editorial cartoonist in the world, they said because he made fun
[53:26.600 --> 53:32.440]  of George Soros puppeteering some of the generals in the White House, which was true.
[53:32.440 --> 53:37.040]  That was in the news and that the Rothschilds fund Soros, which is true because those people
[53:37.040 --> 53:39.320]  happen to be Jewish.
[53:39.320 --> 53:40.320]  That's anti-Semitic.
[53:40.320 --> 53:46.800]  And so Politico playbook, New White House says cartoonist is no longer attending social
[53:46.800 --> 53:47.960]  media summit.
[53:47.960 --> 53:53.120]  So if they put any heat on somebody, those people are immediately thrown under the bus.
[53:53.120 --> 53:54.480]  Well, guess what?
[53:54.480 --> 53:58.040]  The whole Republican Party turned against Trump, we backed him, we got him elected.
[53:58.040 --> 54:00.160]  These people aren't just globalist.
[54:00.160 --> 54:05.160]  They're a bunch of sycophantic cowards that surround Trump.
[54:05.160 --> 54:09.200]  That's exactly what I've been told Alex about this social media summit.
[54:09.200 --> 54:13.600]  Basically if you've ever criticized Trump or one of his policies at any point, which
[54:13.600 --> 54:17.840]  I've done with his Syria attack, which was stupid and he backed away from, or you've
[54:17.840 --> 54:22.360]  done on certain other issues because you have independent thought, you don't get anywhere
[54:22.360 --> 54:23.360]  near Trump.
[54:23.360 --> 54:24.360]  That's not Trump's fault.
[54:24.360 --> 54:27.120]  It's the sycophants that surround him, as you say.
[54:27.120 --> 54:31.840]  And they will throw people like Ben Garrison under a bus and anyone who gets heat.
[54:31.840 --> 54:38.840]  Now media matters has put out another hit piece calling out the extremist figures who've
[54:38.840 --> 54:41.800]  been invited to the White House social media summit.
[54:41.800 --> 54:43.760]  Who are these extremist figures?
[54:43.760 --> 54:50.240]  Well they include a Republican congressman, Gates, Republican Senator Blackburn and Charlie
[54:50.240 --> 54:51.360]  Kirk.
[54:51.360 --> 54:53.080]  So now they're extremists.
[54:53.080 --> 54:58.640]  So you see the line has shifted significantly, hasn't it, from the bar for who qualifies
[54:58.640 --> 55:02.120]  as an extremist seems to be very low these days.
[55:02.120 --> 55:07.280]  And then everyone appeases it and so many of his staff secretly go meet with media matters
[55:07.280 --> 55:11.680]  and they meet with Democrats, they talk crap about Trump and how dummy he is and how he's
[55:11.680 --> 55:16.480]  an idiot and then they all creep back hoping they don't get picked off and targeted.
[55:16.480 --> 55:21.200]  But once they talk to the New York Times or media matters, they're then blackmailed.
[55:21.200 --> 55:24.600]  That's how they work, that we have the New York Times calls our former employees, offers
[55:24.600 --> 55:28.880]  the money and then once they get them to admit stuff they go, ooh, you're the bad one.
[55:28.880 --> 55:32.840]  We're gonna have to do a story on how you're bad unless you say things about Alex Jones
[55:32.840 --> 55:35.280]  and then they criminally make things up.
[55:35.280 --> 55:38.120]  We're getting ready to sue a couple of them because we have to.
[55:38.120 --> 55:41.080]  But that's how these people operate, man.
[55:41.080 --> 55:42.080]  It's insane.
[55:42.080 --> 55:43.080]  Exactly.
[55:43.080 --> 55:48.880]  I mean, the only way to deal with what's happening is, again, to rely on our audience
[55:48.880 --> 55:53.080]  to support us, which they have done and to pursue this privately.
[55:53.080 --> 55:56.560]  Laura Loom has got a $3 billion lawsuit against Facebook.
[55:56.560 --> 55:58.960]  I'm already pursuing Facebook.
[55:58.960 --> 56:04.120]  They failed to turn over the data, which is a legal requirement in the European Union
[56:04.120 --> 56:05.920]  after 30 days under a subject.
[56:05.920 --> 56:07.800]  That's why you were being.
[56:07.800 --> 56:08.800]  Yeah.
[56:08.800 --> 56:10.480]  They refused to turn over the data.
[56:10.480 --> 56:15.600]  The information commissioner for the UK said it was bizarre and if they don't do so after
[56:15.600 --> 56:20.200]  this extra two month period, then that's going to be a big legal problem.
[56:20.200 --> 56:21.800]  And Paul, let's go further.
[56:21.800 --> 56:25.680]  They said three months ago in internal emails that got leaked to Business Insider, Jones
[56:25.680 --> 56:26.680]  has done nothing wrong.
[56:26.680 --> 56:27.680]  We can't ban him.
[56:27.680 --> 56:30.640]  And they say, well, let's just call him a hate figure and then ban him, which they
[56:30.640 --> 56:31.640]  did.
[56:31.640 --> 56:32.640]  So yes, we're getting suits ready.
[56:32.640 --> 56:33.640]  Takes a lot of money.
[56:33.640 --> 56:34.640]  That'll be the next month.
[56:34.640 --> 56:35.640]  Folks get ready.
[56:35.640 --> 56:36.640]  It's happening.
[56:36.640 --> 56:37.640]  Paul's getting ready.
[56:37.640 --> 56:38.640]  He's already gone.
[56:38.640 --> 56:39.640]  The lawyers are gearing up.
[56:39.640 --> 56:42.080]  They have to go through the different levels of this.
[56:42.080 --> 56:46.560]  And now, Paul, you're getting death threats from people on Facebook sent to you from Facebook
[56:46.560 --> 56:47.920]  to your other accounts.
[56:47.920 --> 56:53.200]  And so you now have a criminal filing that you're preparing right now against Facebook.
[56:53.200 --> 56:59.440]  Well, this obviously is a direct violation of UK law, 1988 Militia Communications Act.
[56:59.440 --> 57:04.040]  Quote, any person who sends to another person a letter, electronic communication or article
[57:04.040 --> 57:10.000]  of any description which conveys a threat is guilty of an offense.
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.560]  Facebook is now inciting that very violence, which I've already had on Facebook, by the
[57:14.560 --> 57:15.960]  way, for years when I was on it.
[57:15.960 --> 57:16.960]  Paul, stand there.
[57:16.960 --> 57:17.960]  We've got to go to break.
[57:17.960 --> 57:18.960]  This is critical.
[57:18.960 --> 57:19.960]  I'm going to say this right now, folks.
[57:19.960 --> 57:23.920]  Under Section 230, they could argue it's third party immunity that once they're told
[57:23.920 --> 57:25.920]  they have to remove a death threat.
[57:25.920 --> 57:31.320]  But now they're officially saying death threats are allowed after they defame someone saying
[57:31.320 --> 57:32.560]  they're marked for death.
[57:32.560 --> 57:33.560]  They're done.
[57:33.560 --> 57:34.560]  The lawyers are hands down.
[57:34.560 --> 57:36.560]  But what does that tell you?
[57:36.560 --> 57:38.520]  They don't think the country's going to be here soon.
[57:38.520 --> 57:41.400]  I think they're getting ready to nuke Trump or pull something.
[57:41.400 --> 57:43.680]  They're acting like they're getting ready for a bloody civil war.
[57:43.680 --> 57:49.640]  In fact, there's no doubt they've launched the bugle call for terror attacks.
[57:49.640 --> 57:54.440]  Our powerful line of fluoride free products is the perfect gift for yourself or others
[57:54.440 --> 57:57.760]  who are exploring a healthier, happier lifestyle.

[58:50.760 --> 58:54.760]  I talk about this on the air and I know it stinks into people, but I decided that we're
[58:54.760 --> 58:58.400]  going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago
[58:58.400 --> 59:01.880]  before all the censorship of the tax and fake lawsuits, the rest of it, I would talk about
[59:01.880 --> 59:05.600]  how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and I'd have doctors
[59:05.600 --> 59:07.560]  on an experts to explain why they were so good.
[59:07.560 --> 59:10.880]  And instead the last few years, I'm like, Hey, we need to really support us or they'll
[59:10.880 --> 59:11.880]  shut us down.
[59:11.880 --> 59:14.280]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[59:14.280 --> 59:15.280]  wonderful they were.
[59:15.280 --> 59:17.080]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[59:17.080 --> 59:21.400]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[59:21.400 --> 59:26.640]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the
[59:26.640 --> 59:30.080]  FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it, but then they say you've
[59:30.080 --> 59:34.200]  got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's
[59:34.200 --> 59:38.040]  in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work great.
[59:38.040 --> 59:42.000]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[59:42.000 --> 59:48.400]  God's medicine chest infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three,
[59:48.400 --> 59:53.480]  nine.
[59:53.480 --> 01:00:04.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:17.200]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:22.800]  I'm sitting here on this live Wednesday, July 10 2019 transmission.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:26.640]  It's noon straight up, Paul Watson's with us here, and I'm trying to come up with a
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.200]  headline for this interview.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:32.280]  Once it's not live, we're going to take it and put it out and info wars.com and news
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.800]  wars.com on our own servers and our own streams.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.120]  We built our own system and they're trying to shut that down, but you can email it out.
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.660]  You can Facebook it as well.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:41.660]  You can Twitter it.
[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:42.660]  You can YouTube it.
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:44.160]  They'll try to censor you.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:49.360]  They're trying to tell you what you can do, but now they're organizing our murder, officially
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:53.560]  our death, and I can't come up with a headline strong enough.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:58.760]  I mean, I think this really signifies, Paul, that this is next level.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.880]  Facebook is greenlighting violence against conservatives.
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:07.520]  That's the headline I put out today for the live feed.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.400]  How would you quantify how big this is?
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:14.160]  For me, it shows that they're planning a violent revolution, and suddenly everybody
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:19.520]  from Joe Biden to you name it, are saying we're going to have a physical violent revolution.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.960]  No, they are legitimizing exactly that.
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:27.200]  They're legitimizing violent domestic terrorists to follow through on their threats.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:34.280]  And it's interesting because we had a story back in May, just after I got banned on Facebook,
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:40.560]  where a woman complained about assassination threats against the president on Facebook.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:41.560]  And what did that?
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:44.280]  What did they do? They banned her for three days.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:50.760]  So are we now to assume that President Trump will eventually, or already is, listed in
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.600]  that designated hateful people category?
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:59.400]  So then they allow people to pose death threats and to organize violence against the president
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.400]  of the United States.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:05.320]  That's the level it's got to now, because on the flip side, you've had people literally
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:12.880]  banned for calling out suicide bombers, Islamic terrorists, specifically suicide bombers in
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:16.720]  one instance, Palestinian suicide bombers as barbarians.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.600]  She was banned on Facebook.
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:26.520]  So again, we're literally lower now, according to Zuckerberg and Facebook, we're more subhuman
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:30.320]  than suicide bombers and pedophiles and people like this.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:36.080]  So we're even below them because you can get on Facebook, when Hamas was bombing Israel
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.400]  about a month ago, you could get on Facebook and praise Hamas.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.840]  You can't get on there and neutrally report about Alex Jones.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:48.400]  So we're literally lower than organized terrorist groups and suicide bombers now in the eyes
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:54.680]  of Facebook, a company with 2.4 billion users, which is the eighth largest corporation in
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.680]  the world.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:01.280]  And I would argue the most influential corporation when it comes to steering people's beliefs
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.480]  and opinions, that is frightening.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:08.320]  That is beyond Chinese, communist Chinese social credit score, it's just they've jumped
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:09.320]  the shot completely.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:12.920]  Well, Paul, what they're doing is whatever the Democrats, the EU and the Chi-Coms, tell
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.480]  them, they're adopting it.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.980]  They admit that.
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:20.400]  And so what we're seeing is what the Democrats, what the EU and what others want, and it's
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.480]  just flaming, flagrant authoritarianism.
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:29.280]  Yeah, and there's all this debate about, oh, is Google going to build a censored search
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.440]  engine in China?
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.800]  That's controversial, isn't it?
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:35.320]  Is Facebook going to integrate more with the Chinese government?
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.440]  Because the Chinese government's bad, isn't it?
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:42.400]  Because they identify dissidents who commit thought crimes and then either imprison them
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.680]  or make them social pariahs, ostracize them from society.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.680]  That's bad.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:51.080]  How dare Google or Facebook even consider doing that in China?
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:55.240]  They're doing it right now in the West, even more so.
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.240]  And where is it?
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:59.000]  Like Breitbart reported on this, obviously we did.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.560]  Where's Fox News?
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.880]  Where are the big conservative talking heads?
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.520]  None of them are even raising this.
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:05.880]  It's barely a news story.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.480]  You know, RT did a story on it, that's it.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.440]  The Russian government will cover it.
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:13.280]  Fox News doesn't give a damn.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:18.440]  And Tommy Robinson is facing two to three years for asking questions outside a convicted
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:22.360]  pedophile ring court saying, what do you think of your sentencing?
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:26.920]  They tell him you were born out your mother's ass and then now he faces two to three years.
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.880]  And the media is like, well, he's in contempt.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.920]  He didn't get a jury trial.
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:31.920]  It's not even real.
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:36.880]  Paul Watson, summit.news, infowars.com, everyone fight back, spread those links.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:37.880]  We're not backing down.
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:38.880]  Neither are you.
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:39.880]  But you agree with me, Paul?
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:42.480]  This signifies they're getting ready to go violent big time.
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:47.920]  Oh, it's creepy, and if they don't reverse this immediately, then all bets are off, Alex.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:48.920]  That's right.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:52.520]  This is a major test to see of what, what we'll put up with.
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.520]  Thank you, Paul.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.520]  Amazing job.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.520]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:04.040]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:07.200]  Yours and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:11.320]  And we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen, but I wanted to take just
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:15.560]  a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:19.480]  you saw those lies against us the last week, the worst things you can say about people
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:22.580]  that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:27.000]  And so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  in my heart.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.960]  I want you to know that love is right back at you, and I want to thank you for all you've
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:35.000]  done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support, because I'm committed
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.480]  to fight to the end, but I want to win.
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:41.480]  And without you, I'm going to be destroyed, and it's not going to be fun, but that's not
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.480]  what's important.
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:43.720]  The enemy could win.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.840]  You're a key chess piece in this fight.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.080]  We're being used by God.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.080]  You're being used by God.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:52.160]  This is Providence, so I salute you, and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.160]  of my heart.
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:06:18.440]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:36.960]  Well, if you're a TV listener, you can see this, if you're a radio listener, it's all
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:40.640]  on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:46.320]  I've got, it's not exaggerate, about 150 news articles right here.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:52.600]  It's all over mainstream, saying everything that I said seven, eight, nine years ago,
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:56.920]  everything Roger Stone said seven, eight, nine years ago, and in the book, he wrote
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:08.200]  Clinton's War on Women four years ago, four years ago, Trump's blueprint for the campaign.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:13.840]  And now the media trying to spin Epstein onto Trump, when even the lawyers for the victims
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:17.200]  say, no, Trump's the only person that helped, he was never on the airplanes, he was never
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.520]  around these kids.
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:23.800]  One time he walked in to a party and broad daylight at a pool said, aren't they nice
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.760]  having all the, letting all the neighborhood kids play here.
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:29.760]  And they said, these aren't neighborhood kids and Trump ran out of the building.
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:34.040]  Roger Stone has the exclusive, he lives in Florida, he knows, and his kids, he's covered
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.520]  Epstein and the whole inside baseball.
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:45.560]  But what we know now is Google, Facebook, Twitter, mainstream corporate media, Wikipedia
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:50.920]  are all covering up what's really happening.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:59.120]  They are all covering up any connection to Epstein to the Clintons or the logs on the
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:03.040]  airplanes with the little girls names as initials.
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:07.240]  Something incidentally that's in Clinton's War on Women, that is the blueprint of the
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:09.400]  new FBI investigation.
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.560]  So is this investigation going to go deep?
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:21.040]  I was reading yesterday at infowars.com from the FBI press release.
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:29.840]  Things found at Epstein's house, torture chairs, child porn, a whole safe full of little girls.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:36.400]  He reportedly, you know what, his own private sex slave facility with underground basements
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:39.000]  under a temple.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:46.120]  We also covered so much more here on air.
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:51.040]  Here it is, the Clinton's War on Women, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:54.200]  So it's definitely getting bad and it's getting bad quick.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.800]  Let's go ahead and go to Roger Stone.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.480]  Roger, I want to give you the floor of the next few segments to go through all the angles,
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:04.560]  the real history, the cover-up, what this signifies, how this all got released with
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:11.080]  Alan Dershowitz and Mike Sarowitz, others suing to get it, and where do you think this
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.080]  is going?
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.080]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.160]  Well, first of all, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:21.800]  We laid this all out on infowars literally more than two years ago, every last bit of
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.040]  it.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:26.480]  But it's really an epic tale and it's worth telling.
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:33.560]  This all begins when the Palm Beach police get a tip from some parents about a child
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:37.640]  coming home with her lunchbox full of money.
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:42.280]  When they ask her where the money comes from, it's clear that it comes from Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:48.920]  The police launched a long time undercover investigation, but they find evidence of child
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:57.000]  sex trafficking, multiple assaults on minors, an operation in which Grizzlain Maxwell, the
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:04.520]  daughter of the late press baron, Robert Maxwell, later an honored guest at Chelsea Clinton's
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:11.680]  wedding, are actually going to bus stations, train stations, procuring runaways for this
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:12.680]  operation.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:20.000]  In any event, the police chief, who's an honest guy, a guy named Ryder, takes the investigation
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.920]  to the state's attorney, a fellow named Kirschner, expecting a giant indictment.
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:33.680]  And instead, Kirschner indicts Epstein on one count of solicitation, one count.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:44.120]  And the resultant sentence for that is an 18, pardon me, a 15-month sentence of which Epstein
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:50.840]  only serves 13 months in the air-conditioned Palm Beach jail, not in a state penitentiary,
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:58.000]  which is the norm in this state for a sex offender at this level.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.120]  And he's only required to be incarcerated, Alex, from 10 o'clock at night till 6 o'clock
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.280]  in the morning.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.120]  So it's a slap on the wrist.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:13.640]  Ryder, the police chief, outraged, goes to the U.S. attorney for the Fort Lauderdale
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:17.520]  Palm Beach Miami District, Alexander Acosta.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:25.200]  Acosta is a George W. Bush appointee under the Bush Justice Department.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:30.680]  And he conducts his own investigation, he rubber stamps the state charge, and then he
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.680]  seals it.
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:37.240]  It is only because of an epic legal struggle, Alex, by the Palm Beach Post that we know
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:41.080]  that much, that we know exactly what happened.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:45.280]  Roger, we now have people involved in the investigation.
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:49.680]  I'll show some of these articles in a moment saying they were told, leave it alone, Jeffrey
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.800]  Epstein works for U.S. intelligence and the FBI.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.960]  Let's bring in now and then get into all the proof in the next few segments of Robert Mueller
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:01.800]  using him with the cameras in the mansions, the cameras in his New York facility, the
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:09.240]  seven-story dungeon, the dungeon out in the Caribbean, all of these different facilities
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.280]  to basically carry all of this out.
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:16.320]  And as I said last year, Robert Mueller didn't have sex with the children, he just watched
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.440]  all the videos and blackmailed people with it.
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.600]  That became a national news story, but wow, now it's starting to come out.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.720]  Well, Alex, I can't comment on anything.
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.760]  Oh, I forgot, you can't comment on it, I apologize, there's a gag order, excuse me.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.960]  And I will not, and you speak for yourself.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:35.240]  I will say this, that it is, there's really three people who deserve enormous credit for
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:42.760]  busting this story open, Julie Brown, a really crusading reporter with the Miami Herald who
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:51.080]  writes a multi-part series on Epstein, Mike Sertovich who goes to court at a crucial time
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:56.520]  to get certain documents unsealed, and a woman named Conchita Sarnoff who wrote a terrific
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:02.680]  book on this who is an advocate for children and a crusader against child sex trafficking
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:04.960]  who never gave up on this case.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:10.600]  I think this would have been dead and buried without those three individuals and they should
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.320]  be lauded extensively.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:18.440]  What's amazing to me now is the way the mainstream media is trying to play up a Trump connection
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:21.160]  that is peripheral at best.
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:27.360]  Epstein is actually never really a member of the Mar-a-Lago Club, he's a moocher, and
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:34.560]  Trump bars him from the club according to documents that I read when he makes an inappropriate
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:40.800]  approach to a woman named Virginia Roberts who works in the spa at the exclusive Mar-a-Lago
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.320]  Club.
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:48.160]  In her deposition, she says she was in the presence of Trump and Epstein on one occasion
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:54.800]  and that Trump comported himself as a complete gentleman and she saw him do nothing inappropriate.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:14:01.800]  We also know from Virginia Roberts' attorney, Brett Edwards, that the only big name celebrity
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:07.740]  who cooperated in their lawsuit and in investigation was Donald Trump himself.
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:21.880]  So now you have Google and Wikipedia trying to erase the Clinton-Epstein relationship
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:28.920]  when, as you will see in my book, The Clinton's War on Women, FAA records show that Bill
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:37.240]  Clinton is on the airplane of Jeffrey Epstein 26 times.
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:40.580]  He goes to the island 17 times.
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:44.860]  He put out a statement two days ago, he said he was there once, then he's amended it to
[01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:47.060]  say four times.
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:49.020]  All of that is disprovable.
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:53.540]  I got these FAA records through a Freedom of Information Act request.
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:57.980]  It shows that Clinton ditched his secret service detail on numerous occasions.
[01:14:57.980 --> 01:14:59.380]  By the way, let me stop you.
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:01.220]  We have plenty of time to go through all this.
[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:03.580]  You had this in your book four years ago.
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:08.180]  Now we learn the same FAA records were in the secret FBI file suppressed by the U.S.
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:11.820]  Attorney, suppressed by the court that Mike Cernovich and others got released.
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:17.140]  So that, again, is confirming that the information you put in your book, the only place it was,
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:19.140]  was indeed accurate.
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:28.580]  Well, and again, there's very substantial evidence here of a tighter connection.
[01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:32.100]  We know that Epstein was a contributor to Hillary Clinton.
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:36.860]  We know that the Clinton Foundation took a contribution from him after Epstein had...
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:37.860]  Stay there.
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:38.860]  Stay there.
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:41.060]  And Roger, I want you to go through the history and who's really involved, the attempt to
[01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:46.540]  frame Trump, what it means all this is coming out, how they're politically going to deal
[01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:47.540]  with it.
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:50.940]  Nancy Pelosi's daughter saying this is going to bring down a lot of top Democrats.
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:57.780]  I want to get the big picture with you as well.
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:24.460]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:28.100]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:29.100]  healthier I feel.
[01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:31.700]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:36.900]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:39.380]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:47.580]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305, that's 866-295-5305, or order
[01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:56.780]  online hbextract.com, heart and body extract 866-295-5305, or hbextract.com.
[01:16:56.780 --> 01:17:00.780]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector
[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:02.540]  without all the speculation.
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:07.780]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:12.180]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment
[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:15.420]  leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:19.340]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is
[01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:23.500]  in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:27.700]  Not a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have approved a turnkey equipment
[01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:33.980]  sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:34.980]  each month.
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:37.020]  Don't miss this one, stake your claim today.
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:42.860]  Call 800-600-3388, that's 800-600-3388.
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:44.980]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:50.340]  Call now 800-600-3388, 800-600-3388.
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:52.780]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:53.780]  before purchasing.
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:58.100]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:02.300]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators.
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:03.300]  They are technocrats.
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:07.180]  They are control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your
[01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:11.700]  own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:12.700]  with AI gods.
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:16.300]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:17.300]  third dimension.
[01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:21.220]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of
[01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:23.820]  control in our lives is our bodies.
[01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:29.100]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4slife.com, I couldn't do it.
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:33.420]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:39.140]  metalical bottom and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:44.020]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going
[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:45.020]  to find anywhere.
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:50.180]  It is amazing, experience pure metalical bottom and B12 for yourself and fund the second American
[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:58.740]  evolution against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:02.700]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:07.180]  The other thing that's unique about Infowars is it is the only network of this reach that
[01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:12.180]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire,
[01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:15.780]  that's not being funded by a secret foreign government, it is completely independent of
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:16.780]  all that.
[01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:21.980]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:25.860]  and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:30.220]  the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:33.740]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era
[01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:37.620]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:41.620]  who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views, be it persons allowed
[01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:46.300]  to have or express or hear and the Infowars audience has broken through that.
[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:50.580]  They are the bridge from the use of founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:54.460]  and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the blackwarming
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:20:01.460]  defamation, lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:17.460]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:22.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones and Roger Stone has a gag order on him, he's
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:27.700]  not allowed to get into anything to do with the whole fake Russia investigation, that's
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:30.220]  not why he's here today.
[01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:35.620]  He's here because he wrote the defining book The Clinton's War on Women about Jeffrey Epstein
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:36.780]  and all of it.
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:41.380]  He interviewed Brett Edwards and lawyers that worked with the victims and that's how he
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:45.520]  was able to have the manifest logs before anybody ever had them and now all these new
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:49.460]  documents have come out confirming everything Roger has broken down but Roger before you
[01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:53.380]  get into the whole history of it, the background, how this could bring down the whole house of
[01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:59.740]  cards in your words, just briefly with all the censorship by Google and the media trying
[01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:02.820]  to cover this up, why do you think they're so scared?
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:08.700]  Well, it's very interesting, Alex, that the investigation is being run by the public corruption
[01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:12.980]  unit, not the sex trafficking, child sex trafficking unit.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:18.940]  Huge credit needs to go to the Southern District of New York for bringing these charges.
[01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:24.740]  This is not double jeopardy, these appear to be new charges, not the charges that Epstein
[01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:31.300]  was previously charged with in Florida and that leads me to believe that there are other
[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:35.140]  political figures who are going to be embroiled in this.
[01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:39.100]  Nancy Pelosi's daughter speculated about it.
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:42.580]  Was this a blackmail operation, a honey trap?
[01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:44.220]  Was he taking video?
[01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:52.100]  Why was he constantly trying to get powerful men to go to his pedophile island, as Sean
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:59.660]  Andy called it, I mean, I think this is potentially has many, many more shoes to drop.
[01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:07.100]  And we still don't have the answer as to why Alexander Acosta rubber stamped the slap on
[01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:12.020]  the wrist by Florida state prosecutors and then sealed it.
[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:17.660]  We do know that Alberto Gonzalez, who was Bush's attorney general at the time, said
[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:23.660]  that they didn't want to see the matter politicized and we were heading into an election in which
[01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:27.100]  Hillary Clinton was, at that point, the favorite.
[01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:32.700]  So I think reading between the lines, they looked at the Clinton-Epstein connection
[01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:40.660]  and elected not to bring an indictment that was broader for sex trafficking and multiple
[01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:42.660]  offenses.
[01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:53.540]  Now Epstein settled lawsuits with $33 million worth of women or now women, girls then, that
[01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:54.780]  he assaulted.
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:59.700]  A few brave women refused to settle wanting justice.
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:05.620]  Virginia Roberts, now Virginia Roberts-Juffery, was won.
[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:12.340]  And when Brett Edwards, the crusading attorney here in Fort Lauderdale, represented her,
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:19.460]  Epstein turned around and sued him for defamation, a suit that was ultimately settled and did
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:21.220]  not go to court.
[01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:29.620]  So enormous credit belongs to Virginia Roberts for having the guts to see this through.
[01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:36.180]  And again, Julie Brown of the Miami Herald, Mike Cernovich, who deserves enormous credit,
[01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:42.460]  and Conchita Sarnoff, three individuals, unconnected, busted this wide open.
[01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:43.460]  That's right.
[01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:47.020]  And speaking of Brett Edwards, who's represented a lot of the victims successfully, you were
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:49.980]  telling me, I asked if you knew him, you said, of course, read the footnotes, he's
[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:54.780]  one of the experts in your book, let's play a clip of him talking about the only person
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:58.660]  that was helpful, that new Epstein, here it is.
[01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:06.380]  The only thing that I can say about President Trump is that he is the only person who, in
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:11.580]  2009, when I served a lot of subpoenas, on a lot of people, or at least gave notice to
[01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:17.860]  some pretty connected people that I was going, that I wanted to talk to them, is the only
[01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:23.060]  person who picked up the phone and said, let's just talk, I'll give you as much time as you
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:26.940]  want, I'll tell you what you need to know, and was very helpful in the information that
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:34.140]  he gave, and gave no indication whatsoever that he was involved in anything untoward
[01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:38.620]  whatsoever, but had good information, that checked out, and that helped us, and that
[01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:40.820]  we didn't have to take a deposition of him.
[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:41.820]  That was in 2009?
[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:42.820]  That was in 2009.
[01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:44.660]  And that's Bradley Edwards.
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:50.060]  So give us the straight scoop here, because it's in your book, you've told me privately
[01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:54.380]  you had conversations, Trump's all about being in control of his life, he would never go
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:59.780]  somewhere and have sex much less with an underage person, but in some jet, or at some corrupt
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:05.340]  guy's house, you even told the story about one time, he did tell you a man saw some creepy
[01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:09.620]  stuff at Epstein's house, he ran out of there, I mean tell folks what you do know about Trump
[01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:10.620]  at Epstein.
[01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:17.660]  Well, Virginia Roberts says in her deposition that she only saw Trump at Epstein's home
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:24.620]  once and on that occasion, he later said that he said to his driver as they pulled up when
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:29.460]  he saw all these young girls in a swimming pool, boy that Epstein is a nice guy, look
[01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:32.620]  at the way he lets the neighborhood kids use his pool.
[01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:39.420]  He also left after 15 minutes, very uncomfortable with the situation, again Virginia Roberts
[01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:44.140]  said she didn't see the president do anything inappropriate and he was a complete gentleman.
[01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:48.140]  Well, do you remember like three years ago I asked you about this and you said right
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:51.580]  when he was first getting elected you said oh he hates Epstein, we've since then found
[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:58.060]  a couple clips where he said he didn't like Epstein years ago, even before he won.
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:04.900]  He barred him from his club, that was a good 15 years ago, so look this is a phony effort
[01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:11.580]  by the mainstream media to associate Epstein with the president whose relationship is peripheral
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:18.700]  at best, whereas Bill Clinton is put out a statement that is a bald face lie, only on
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:27.140]  his plane once, actually Epstein used the, pardon me, Clinton used Epstein's plane to
[01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:34.420]  fly to Asia to pick up a check from a sultan who was another known pedophile for the Clinton
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:35.420]  Foundation.
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:39.140]  You'll find that in my book, The Clinton's War on Women.
[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:45.460]  This is an unfair attack on President Trump, his relationship with Epstein is peripheral
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:50.020]  at best, there's no evidence of wrongdoing on his part, there's not even evidence of
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:53.260]  knowledge on his part, and he's cooperated.
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:58.540]  By the way, let me stop you again, this is just out from the Daily Mail, 26 women have
[01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:03.340]  said that Trump assaulted them never with any witnesses, always in some public place.
[01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:08.700]  Now Katie Johnson who claimed that she was assaulted by Donald Trump fabricated the story,
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:13.300]  four of the women, five of the six women with Kavanaugh admit they fabricated it, some
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:17.780]  are being indicted, the woman who alleged that Donald Trump raped her at age 13, one
[01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:22.100]  of the billionaire pedophiles Jeffrey Epstein's notorious sex parties fabricated the story,
[01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:25.900]  they've learned exclusively, well thought about when we come back, but it's now conclusively
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:30.180]  proven fabricated, who is paying for all these fabrications?
[01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:35.860]  It's an interesting question, Alex, during the 2016 campaign, some man calling my cell
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:43.580]  phone and saying, Katie Johnson and hanging up, it happened multiple times, she scheduled
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:50.020]  a press conference for which she never showed up, somebody paid her to bear false witness
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:56.700]  against the president, there is nothing there, I've known Donald Trump for 40 years, and
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:28:02.620]  yes, he was quite the playboy in between marriages, and he dated some beautiful women, but Donald
[01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:09.260]  Trump loves women, not young girls, and the idea that he was involved in anything inappropriate
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:16.140]  here is a smear, it's nothing but a smear, meanwhile, Google takes down all of the images
[01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:22.700]  of Epstein and Bill Clinton, and Wikipedia rewrites Epstein's bio to cut Bill Clinton
[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:27.980]  out of it like he doesn't exist, it is a perfect example of the same kind of censorship, it's
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:33.620]  being used on info wars, it's being used on the stone cold truth, it's being used on
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:40.180]  conservative and libertarians, and Trump supporters, and non liberals on social media.
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:44.420]  All right, Roger Stone, let's talk about what's coming next in this war, why the deep

[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:06.060]  seize my mother's house, I sued the IRS in one, I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating
[01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:09.820]  them ever since, I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of

[01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:59.100]  take charge of it.
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:03.020]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against
[01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:07.540]  this, and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info wars 50% off, but we
[01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:12.620]  make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff, we're making like $2 on the toothpaste
[01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:16.780]  at that price, and we're moving a ton of it, okay, but you move a couple hundred thousand
[01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:20.660]  dollars or something and you get $20,000, that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure,
[01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:24.020]  the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew, so we need to sell millions and millions and millions
[01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:25.020]  of dollars of product.
[01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:29.220]  I want to expand, not contract, and for six months we've not just been able to stand still,
[01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:33.740]  the enemy's been winning, and I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this,
[01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:36.820]  I like to be expanding, I like to be winning, I like to be fighting, and we are winning
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:40.660]  the info war, that's why we're so hated, but we need to be retreaded, we need to be
[01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:43.860]  tuned up, we need to be fixed up, we never have time to get into dry up, we got a lot
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:48.700]  of holes shot at us, and the enemy wants to silence us, then they're really going to
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:52.100]  plant child porn on us, then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else, I mean
[01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:56.220]  the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor, funded by foreign banks and the CHICOM,

[01:32:49.300 --> 01:33:01.420]  side you're on and take action.
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:24.620]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show, live, raw, and unfiltered, it's the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:40.980]  I knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him, people in Palm Beach knew him, he was
[01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:46.060]  a fixture in Palm Beach, I had a falling out with him a long time ago, I don't think I've
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:51.780]  spoken to him for 15 years, I wasn't a fan, I was not, yeah a long time ago, I'd say maybe
[01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:58.700]  15 years, I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you, I was not a fan of his, so I feel
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:04.860]  very badly actually for Secretary Acosta, because I've known him as being somebody that works
[01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:10.180]  so hard and has done such a good job, I feel very badly about that whole situation, but
[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:13.820]  we're going to be looking at that, and looking at it very closely.
[01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:21.580]  Bill Clinton, nice guy, got a lot of problems coming up in my opinion with the famous island
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:30.980]  with Jeffrey Epstein, a lot of problems.
[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:37.300]  I'm not going to cut into Roger Stone's time here, because it's so important, but I'm at
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:43.140]  the center, you're at the center of two major court victories in the last 24 hours, but
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:53.300]  you're not going to see in newspapers, so second half of the next segment, I will get
[01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:58.340]  into some of those big successes for you.
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:02.820]  One deals with Facebook, one deals with Sandy Hook, in fact guys I had my Hartford Current
[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:09.460]  article here and I can't find it, just print me another one please, but going back to Roger
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:13.660]  Stone, yeah, look at that headline, I'm going to do it later, guys, we'll do it later, okay?
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:16.980]  Because if you read that headline, you wouldn't even know what you're reading until you actually
[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:23.500]  read the article or the court ruling, unheard of, one in a million, no press coverage, wait
[01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:25.980]  till you learn about it next segment.
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:31.620]  Also, Facebook just changed their policy of saying they can kill us whenever they want
[01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:35.980]  to, so that was all a test ladies and gentlemen, we're going to cover that next segment.
[01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:39.260]  In fact, I want to hold Roger over a little bit in the next segment to get into censorship
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:40.260]  with him.
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:48.700]  But getting back to Roger Stone, obviously, who needs no introduction, Roger, the next
[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:53.820]  shoe to drop, you got your ear to the ground, that's why you came on the broadcast today,
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:58.860]  let's spend some time, 35,000 foot view, not just okay, we've been vindicated, you've
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:03.620]  been vindicated, Epstein, it's all true, he was caught reportedly with more pedophilia
[01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:08.140]  crap, dungeons, torture chairs at his house, according to the FBI list of things that were
[01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:12.820]  found in his home, that's up on infowars.com and a Jamie White article, we'll get to that
[01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:17.780]  a little bit later, but what's the next shoe to drop, who's implicated, who's on these
[01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:18.780]  aircraft?
[01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:24.860]  Well, we know that former Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico was on the aircraft, we know
[01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:30.420]  that Senator George Mitchell, the former Senate Majority Leader was on the aircraft, we know
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:43.300]  that Stephen Hawking, the athlete was on the aircraft, we know that Prince Andrew of the
[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:50.820]  royal family visited the pedophile island, according to Virginia Roberts' deposition,
[01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:56.500]  which I have read, she was forced to have sex with him, so it touches the British royal
[01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:57.500]  family.
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:03.300]  The fact that the public correction unit of the Southern District of New York is covering
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:10.540]  this, I think is laudable, this looks to me like a political scandal, now, we're speculating,
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:17.940]  does did Epstein have tape, incriminating videos, did he have other proof, is this why
[01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:25.780]  he was constantly inviting powerful men to his compound, which Sean Hannity called a
[01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:30.900]  pedophile island, you know, if there's one other person who does deserve credit for staying
[01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:34.140]  on this story, it would be Sean Hannity.
[01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:41.700]  When everybody else dropped it, during 2016, he came up with the term Lolita Express, he
[01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:47.060]  came up with the term pedophile island, he presented the straightforward facts based
[01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:54.580]  on the FAA flight records, so he also deserves enormous credit.
[01:37:54.580 --> 01:38:01.180]  We also don't know whether Epstein's confederates like Grizzlain Maxwell will become state's
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:05.100]  evidence witnesses, that's certainly a possibility.
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:12.060]  Again, this whole thing was dormant for so many years, and now it is being prosecuted
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:18.460]  by the Trump Justice Department, despite an incredible effort by the mainstream media
[01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:22.460]  to make this a Trump scandal, which it is not.
[01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:27.700]  He has no exposure here, he's done nothing inappropriate, he cut this guy off, he barred
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:34.940]  him from his private club, he was not a fan, as you just saw, they would travel somewhat
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:41.180]  in charitable circles in Palm Beach and New York, they're both fabulously rich guys, but
[01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:44.780]  there's no evidence that they socialized together.
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:48.100]  I know Donald Trump, this is not his thing.
[01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:53.060]  Well by the way, I want you to get into that, but I would drop Trump if there was any proof
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:56.540]  of pedophilia like a stinking dead cat.
[01:38:56.540 --> 01:39:02.780]  The truth is the entire corporate media is going overdrive to cover up Epstein and Clinton
[01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:06.380]  and all these Democrats' connections, there'll be a few Republicans obviously as well, a few
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:10.540]  neocons, and then Trump's whole history is going after pedophiles and saying kill him
[01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:15.500]  on his Twitter five years ago, and we've seen a tenfold arrest of pedophiles, we're seeing
[01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:20.940]  child trafficking being absolutely shut down and Trump making a big issue out of it, so
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:26.420]  you judge a tree by its fruits, of the 26 women, none of it's real, I've been lied about,
[01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:30.820]  I've experienced the media, I've experienced the deep state after I'm sued, mailing me
[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:37.340]  secret code, yes, coded pedophile stuff, where you can't see it, it's zeros and ones hidden
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:44.380]  in the email, which then they subpoena, which then they find, not the people that sent it
[01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:48.300]  of course, I meant which the Democrats subpoena they find, they would never do anything like
[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:53.540]  that to me, the point is, is that this is just unbelievable, and so there's no evidence,
[01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:59.820]  I'm not just here defending Trump, I'm attacked because I defend Trump, but with Clinton and
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:04.720]  Hillary and all of them, and the people that work for them in their foundation, you can't
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:10.460]  take two steps without, you know, the head of her foundation is a convicted child trafficker,
[01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:12.460]  I mean these people are monsters.
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:20.980]  Well, Alex, I could not agree with you more, as you know, I'm facing my own ordeal, I'm
[01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:28.020]  charged with seven counts of lying to Congress and related offenses, I have vigorously contested
[01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:33.900]  those charges, I am not guilty, I will go to trial, I need people who want to help me,
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:40.700]  because I need to raise one million dollars to hire another lawyer to go to StoneDefenseFund.com,
[01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:47.820]  it's a daunting task, those are the few things I am allowed to say about my case, so post,
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:56.020]  please go to StoneDefenseFund.com and make a contribution, because I can only reach out
[01:40:56.020 --> 01:41:01.460]  to supporters of the president and to info warriors, they destroyed me financially.
[01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:07.740]  I would gladly pay for my own legal defense if I could, but I've lost my home, my savings,
[01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:13.460]  most of my insurance, my car, I'm living hand to mouth, and still I like you, Alex, I'm
[01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:19.900]  a fighter, I won't fold, and I will go to trial in Washington DC this November, so please,
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:24.780]  your prayers, I need your prayers, make no mistake about that, but those who can make
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:26.820]  a contribution, God bless you.
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:31.460]  Well, let me be clear about this, people don't understand, when you get the real high-powered
[01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:37.820]  lawyers that know the subtle parlance and nomenclature of the courts, and they have
[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:42.260]  to do research to make sure everything they're doing is exactly right in the cases for appeal
[01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:48.340]  and everything else, when they do it, it costs, for say a criminal case like Roger Stone,
[01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:54.420]  a million dollars, they had to go over hundreds of thousands of documents, and then when you
[01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:59.580]  just dump documents on them, then you have more problems, as we had to do, we spent
[01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:07.820]  $200,000 in one Sandy Hook case, because the judge ordered millions of emails turned over,
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:11.580]  we fought it seven, eight times, we should have had a better retention policy of getting
[01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:15.380]  rid of stuff, not to cover it up, that everybody else doesn't, we're just idiots, but now we
[01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:18.700]  know to do that, we had to go through hundreds of thousands of these emails, cost us hundreds
[01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:22.020]  of thousands of dollars, and still we didn't find the hidden crap that somebody put in
[01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:25.540]  there as a time bomb, so you don't understand folks, this is how they destroy you, but you
[01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:30.580]  standing with us is what's allowed us to continue to operate, I want to ask Roger Stone about
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:35.300]  censorship and Trump's big media conference coming up tomorrow, and are we going to see
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:39.140]  action because the biggest place we haven't seen action is from Trump, we've heard he's
[01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:45.940]  going to do something, but so far we haven't seen Jack Crap, I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com,
[01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:51.140]  newswars.com, tomorrow's news today, whatever you do, spread those articles, spread those
[01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:57.700]  videos, we'll be right back.
[01:42:57.700 --> 01:43:05.420]  We will always be the people who defeated a tyrant, cross the continent, harness science,
[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:13.700]  took to the skies, and soared into the heavens, because we will never forget that we are Americans,
[01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:21.300]  and the future belongs to us.
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:26.340]  The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud, and the free.
[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:33.580]  We are one people chasing one dream, and one magnificent destiny.
[01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:41.980]  We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart, and we are all made by the
[01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:44.980]  same almighty God.
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:49.500]  infowars.com, tomorrow's news today, full power to the republic in the name of Jesus
[01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:57.380]  Christ, full power, damn the torpedoes, go straight at him.
[01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:06.620]  So the info wars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting
[01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:11.540]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:12.540]  one another.
[01:44:12.540 --> 01:44:16.820]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:21.940]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:26.180]  self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:30.540]  content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:34.300]  and supporting info wars, and it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is,
[01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:38.700]  whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually
[01:44:38.700 --> 01:44:43.140]  compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time
[01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:47.740]  support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to
[01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:52.060]  see and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate American democratic expression
[01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:57.380]  and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[01:44:57.380 --> 01:45:02.580]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful

[01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:19.580]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:19.580 --> 01:47:24.740]  Welcome back, Roger Stone, former chief advisor to President Trump. Long time friend is our
[01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:31.260]  guest. He leaves us here in about five minutes. Tommy Robinson gave us this morning during
[01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:34.900]  the David Knight show, what could be his last interview. He's facing two to three years
[01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:42.340]  in prison. No jury trial for exposing pedophile rings that were convicted. Powerful interview
[01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:46.980]  can air for two segments. And then I have a lawyer joining us, Norm Pattis with breaking
[01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:51.780]  news at the bottom of the hour. I'm not yet at liberty to get into with you, but this
[01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:57.420]  just broke on info wars.com. We learned that anyone listed as a dangerous individual, Facebook
[01:47:57.420 --> 01:48:03.820]  said, don't just criticize them, but you're allowed to foment violent conspiracies to
[01:48:03.820 --> 01:48:09.780]  kill them that actually say that it's okay to foment a violent conspiracy to organize
[01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:15.940]  people to kill them or cause other bodily harm. Now, this shows that Facebook was testing
[01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:22.300]  to see what they could get away with. And then Antifa literally is peopled by the Silicon
[01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:27.780]  Valley folks, the university trash, and the leftist in government. And then that's come
[01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:33.340]  out in the news. And you see Joe Biden and all of them calling for a violent revolution.
[01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:37.980]  Members of Congress calling for banning free speech. What do you make of this, Roger Stone?
[01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:45.100]  Well, Alex, I think it's pretty clear. You know, I'm a veteran of 10 national presidential
[01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:51.060]  campaigns from Richard Nixon to Ronald Reagan to that great American patriot, Bob Dole, who
[01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:56.380]  was never a member of either the trilateral commission or the council on foreign relations.
[01:48:56.380 --> 01:49:02.620]  And of course, Donald Trump. And I think the president's reelection looks very strong with
[01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:11.700]  one giant dark cloud on the horizon. And that horizon is internet censorship. 2016 was the
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:17.820]  year in which the mainstream media lost their stranglehold, their monopoly on political discourse
[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:23.500]  in this country. They could no longer drive their fake news message, because you had a
[01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:28.820]  vibrant, robust alternative media based in the internet from which Donald Trump could
[01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:35.220]  counterattack, from which he could launch his counter punches. Without that, we'll go back
[01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:43.820]  to a time that CNN and MSNBC and ABC and CBS and NBC will be allowed to dominate the race
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:50.380]  from the beginning. And that's dangerous. They may not censor the president himself,
[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:55.060]  although my guess is that he's actually reaching millions more people than we're actually
[01:49:55.060 --> 01:50:02.900]  told. And he too is probably being shadow banned on a more modest basis. But if you allow
[01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:10.620]  the de-platforming of all of his supporters on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram, places
[01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:15.820]  like info wars, you're taking away the amplification ability.
[01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:21.540]  Well, sure, Roger, they've gone way beyond that to saying that the users can't say our
[01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:26.660]  names or share our information and banning words and terms like communist China does.
[01:50:26.660 --> 01:50:32.300]  And now I don't know if you read this, they literally say you're allowed to organize violent
[01:50:32.300 --> 01:50:36.740]  acts, including the killing of people. Now, now people say, well, some anti for that works
[01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:42.140]  there did this. Exactly. There are mutinies going inside big tech. Even when the head
[01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:49.180]  heads, they don't do it. The left is so apoplectic, so insane. I have leftist members of my family
[01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:54.340]  who go to the press. I'm getting ready to have a sue and literally tell them 100% made
[01:50:54.340 --> 01:50:59.140]  up lies. And it's part of this Trump derangement syndrome, Roger.
[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:04.260]  Well, also, the other thing I've noticed, Alex, is when I post something that people
[01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:11.420]  like and they seek to retweet it or repost it, they're immediately blocked and locked
[01:51:11.420 --> 01:51:19.140]  out of the system, like clockwork. So look, this is the greatest single danger to Trump's
[01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:24.540]  reelection. This is the greatest single danger to his reform agenda. This is the greatest
[01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:26.540]  single danger to his legacy.
[01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:30.820]  No, I totally agree. And you can't say it on air. We've had talks. You've had major
[01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:36.900]  events with major members, major members of the White House, major members of the campaign,
[01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:42.500]  and you to credit got this social media thing going tomorrow. But I still hope this is just
[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:47.300]  some pat on the head to people. We need action now. I mean, this is insane.
[01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:53.140]  Look, the people in the reelection campaign is some very good people there are well aware
[01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:59.500]  of my position and hopefully they will adopt it. The Internet censorship, along with the
[01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:05.260]  integrity and an honest election, are the two great obstacles to Trump's reelection.
[01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:12.260]  He's got an extraordinarily strong record to run on. Six million new jobs, 650,000 new
[01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:20.460]  manufacturing jobs, 224,000 jobs in the last quarter alone, far beyond expectations. Unemployment
[01:52:20.460 --> 01:52:28.940]  at the lowest point since 1969. Wage growth at the fastest growth base in American history.
[01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:36.740]  And reasserting ourselves around the globe, but not looking for more formal, pardon me,
[01:52:36.740 --> 01:52:43.100]  foreign wars to jump into. He puts out the olive branch because it never hurts to talk.
[01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:49.500]  He meets the dictator in North Korea. He gives up nothing, no concessions, no agreements,
[01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:55.820]  no pallets of cash like they did in the Obama and Clinton administrations, but keeping the
[01:52:55.820 --> 01:53:02.140]  talks going because you can only get to peace through negotiation. One thing I know, Donald
[01:53:02.140 --> 01:53:07.660]  Trump would rather make no deal than a bad deal. He will never make a bad deal for the
[01:53:07.660 --> 01:53:13.020]  United States, but he would like to get world peace. He would like to disarm what Bill
[01:53:13.020 --> 01:53:19.820]  Clinton called the greatest single danger to the future of America, a nuclear North Korea.
[01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:26.700]  So Trump's working for peace every day and the peacenicks in the left wing of the Democratic
[01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:29.260]  Party do nothing but criticize.
[01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:34.660]  Roger, he's even going after the ethanol subsidy scam. He's going after all the Republican
[01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:39.500]  port barrel things. I mean, Trump is really trying to do what he said he'd do. He's gotten
[01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:42.980]  a lot done and we know he's for real because all hell is breaking loose. Thanks for giving
[01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:50.500]  us the exclusive inside on so much of what's happening, Roger. Congratulations on trailblazing
[01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:52.380]  so much of what's unfolded.
[01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:55.140]  Alex, it's great to be with you. Many thanks.
[01:53:55.140 --> 01:54:01.860]  Thank you. There goes Roger Stone, really a great guy. The media demonizes, even lies
[01:54:01.860 --> 01:54:06.180]  about him, but he knows his stuff when it comes to politics and the world. Okay, we're
[01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:11.860]  going to start the next hour and I'm going to air this Tommy Robinson interview from
[01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:18.900]  this morning that I was sitting there at home with tears in my eyes watching with David
[01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:22.940]  Dike, what he's facing, how the media has responded, how they demonize him, how they
[01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:28.100]  lie about him. That'll be the second and third segment. And then we're going to have
[01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:32.140]  Norm Paterson with some huge constitutional developments and some victories that info
[01:54:32.140 --> 01:54:37.100]  wars has had that you've had that you're not going to hear about anywhere else. That's
[01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:40.780]  really what this is about. Have you noticed how we're just all over the news constantly
[01:54:40.780 --> 01:54:46.540]  in the zeitgeist because we're at the center of the fight. This is the war and you listening
[01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:52.460]  and you watching of there as well. You know, obviously it wasn't a rocket science event
[01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:59.420]  when last fourth of July, which is just last week, Colin Kaepernick pulled that stunt saying,
[01:54:59.420 --> 01:55:03.820]  I don't like American flags on Nike shoes and Nike agreements. And yes, they're hateful
[01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:09.660]  slave masters are bad. Betsy Ross loves the KKK. No, Betsy Ross was a famous abolitionist,
[01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:15.140]  one of the top abolitionists at the time. So an abolitionist credit the American flag.
[01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:19.740]  It's the original 13 stars submission by George Washington. Well, it's not rocket science.
[01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:23.740]  I said, Hey, let's put out a really good looking navy blue shirt that says America's back on
[01:55:23.740 --> 01:55:30.940]  the back in fours.com on the front Betsy Ross flag. And it says these colors don't run.
[01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:35.820]  There's another variant that says established 1776. On the back, these colors don't run.
[01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:42.060]  Now I figured that it would be a popular shirt. I mean, usually a really popular shirt, we
[01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:46.220]  sell like 5000. It takes millions to run this place. So it's a drop in the barrel, but it
[01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:51.300]  gets the word out. And it triggers leftist. We had one shirt we sold 100,000 of that was
[01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:55.520]  Hillary for prison, but half of those I sold at $5 apiece. That's cost. Well, these new
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:00.700]  shirts cost us $678, depending on the size, because they're that soft fabric, that really
[01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:04.980]  nice stretchable fabric. And then it costs $2 or $3 to print depending on how much we
[01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:12.340]  put on it. So these are like $11, $12 shirts. Space Force costs us like $14. So when we're
[01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:18.860]  selling the Space Force shirt or the Betsy Ross shirt for 1776, even though we're about
[01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:27.180]  to sell the 4000 we printed, all shirts are 1776. All shirts are 1776. And some of these
[01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:33.060]  shirts that have printing on the front, the back, the sidearm cost $16, $17. Again, the
[01:56:33.060 --> 01:56:37.820]  Space Force, they cost us like 14. Like I said, the Betsy Ross altogether, like nine
[01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:43.180]  or 10 because the printing has got the expensive fabric. So these are nice designer shirts
[01:56:43.180 --> 01:56:48.300]  that didn't give us like five bucks a shirt to help operate. And I need a lot of money.
[01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:52.740]  We've got big covert operations running. Obviously, that my name isn't on for obvious
[01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:56.340]  reasons. We had covert operations running against the globalist before Everglot Shadowband.
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:57:00.420]  I knew it was coming. Why do you think I built this place? Why do you think Matt Dredge came
[01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:05.180]  here at the place that had done it and said everybody else should do it? Because we're
[01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:09.260]  in a war. We don't look at this as entertainment or fun or being cool or having the biggest
[01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:16.020]  house or private jet. That money all went into the war, ladies and gentlemen, infowarstort.com
[01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:20.460]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. We have the new special,
[01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:28.260]  1776 Worldwide Specials. Tomorrow we kick off 8am, 34 hour broadcast, 1776 Worldwide.
[01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:37.620]  All the products are 75 to 25% off and dozens of best sellers are 1776. 1776. The answer
[01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:44.060]  to the 1984 system is 1776 Worldwide. Take advantage and fund this war machine and you've
[01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:53.180]  got my guarantee to take the enemy on. 1776 Worldwide. That's a term I coined 15 years
[01:57:53.180 --> 01:57:59.460]  ago. What does it really mean? It means the idea of American freedom renaissance worldwide.
[01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:04.780]  It doesn't mean we go conquer countries. It means our superior Western values of true
[01:58:04.780 --> 01:58:12.300]  freedom get adopted because compared to globalism, it's night and day. We're going to do a 34
[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:18.220]  hour special broadcast that kicks off this Thursday morning at 8am with David Knight.
[01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:23.860]  Runs right through with me and many others till the next day at 6pm on the war room.
[01:58:23.860 --> 01:58:28.980]  We're going to have our crew in DC at the White House summit on social media. We're
[01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:32.900]  going to be at the after party with all the key folks taking action against censorship
[01:58:32.900 --> 01:58:38.100]  and so much more. So everybody share that link infowarstort.com forward slash show kicking
[01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:46.500]  off this Thursday at 8am central at infowarstort.com forward slash show 1776 Worldwide.
[01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:51.740]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus here on the air. Thanks for holding. Hey Alex.
[01:58:51.740 --> 01:58:55.500]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air. I talked to a lot of people
[01:58:55.500 --> 01:58:59.700]  here out in New York City and one thing I could tell you is that almost nobody agrees
[01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:03.660]  with these wars. I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go
[01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:08.180]  to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the
[01:59:08.180 --> 01:59:12.140]  eyes of the public approaching 2020. That's it. I mean if Trump buys into this, it'll
[01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:15.100]  be the end of his presidency. It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than
[01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:18.700]  assassinating him. It's a time to be praying my friend. I agree entirely and the last thing
[01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:22.660]  I just want to say Alex is I know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements
[01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:26.820]  have arrived man. I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I'd love
[01:59:26.820 --> 01:59:30.740]  to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down, no you've
[01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:35.860]  gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself
[01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:39.460]  and many others who are going to continue. We're going to keep fighting in the Info War
[01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:43.860]  and even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten
[01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:51.940]  a lot of people fired up for liberty. Thank you sir for calling.
[01:59:51.940 --> 02:00:02.740]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. I'm here to say and this is a reason why I came
[02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:09.220]  to see you Alex. You are one of the very few who are operating under this theory to be
[02:00:09.220 --> 02:00:15.020]  an independent American in a big way. If you're calling it as media fine, if you're calling
[02:00:15.020 --> 02:00:20.220]  it sports, whatever it is, but you've got to be the greatest you can be. Now, I don't
[02:00:20.220 --> 02:00:25.940]  know why they've been successful in pushing everybody into these little ghettos of these
[02:00:25.940 --> 02:00:33.580]  Facebooks and these tweets and these Instagrams, these instas. This is ghetto. This is ghetto.
[02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:38.820]  This is corporate. They're taking your energy. They're taking your energy and you're getting
[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:43.220]  nothing in return. Nothing. They're dumbing the language down. Twitter's designed to reduce
[02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:48.460]  the language directly out of 1984. It's in stock. I had a Supreme Court justice tell
[02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:53.180]  me to my face it's over for me. It's over for you. They've got the votes now to enforce
[02:00:53.180 --> 02:00:56.780]  copyright law. You're out of there. They're going to make it so headlines you can't even
[02:00:56.780 --> 02:01:01.420]  use headlines. To have a Supreme Court justice say that to my face that it's over. They've
[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:07.820]  got the votes, which means time is limited. Time is not forever. How many more moons and
[02:01:07.820 --> 02:01:13.620]  sunrises will you see in your life? Rise and fall. There's not that many. It's a small
[02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:18.500]  amount. So for people to be saying with this attitude, oh, I'll get on with my life and
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:24.100]  my greatness sometime. No, no, you can't. We're being enslaved now. And that's it. Under
[02:01:24.100 --> 02:01:30.340]  the TPP, they admit you can't put a headline to the New York Times. You're sending massive
[02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:35.540]  traffic to them. They're claiming you're taking their words. This is insane. And you had the
[02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:39.780]  Justice Stephen Breyer said we need to look at a global law. Now, remember just recently
[02:01:39.780 --> 02:01:43.860]  getting it lined up with it. So they're getting ready for these decisions to come. You thought
[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:47.660]  Obamacare was shocking. You thought some of these other decisions were shocking. Wait
[02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:54.140]  until these copyright laws work their way up. And the Supreme Court decides you cannot
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:02:03.700]  have a website with news headlines linking across the board. Waging war on corruption.
[02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:16.340]  This Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war. That is what
[02:02:16.340 --> 02:02:21.420]  Matt Rudd said here almost four years ago. And has it not been proven completely true?
[02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:26.900]  Just as we went to the last break, I said, Hey, get me these two guys from our camera
[02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:32.180]  crew together. I want to go out and shoot this important report today. And the producer
[02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:39.860]  pop mayor and they said they're in DC to cover the summit on Internet censorship. Oh, well,
[02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:45.020]  give me this person. Well, they're on vacation. Well deserved. And I'm not complaining, but
[02:02:45.020 --> 02:02:49.340]  there's two ways to destroy us. Well, there's more than that, but two big ones. If the globalist
[02:02:49.340 --> 02:02:55.300]  can shut us down and suicide of existence and censor us, or if you don't support. And
[02:02:55.300 --> 02:03:01.140]  again, I'm very thankful for all your support. But I need three or four more camera people.
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:07.860]  I need three or four more field reporters. I need to be able to put people in there
[02:03:07.860 --> 02:03:11.820]  and do other live shows. And there's a few new shows that are finally about to start
[02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:17.500]  in the next month. It's just been, we've been held back. And I got a lot of covert stuff
[02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:22.620]  where I see somebody who's already successful and they need help. Project Veritas and people
[02:03:22.620 --> 02:03:26.740]  like Tommy Robinson, but that's the tip of the iceberg. I've given money to over a hundred
[02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:32.060]  groups that I've seen kicking ass with no strings. Groups that are busting pedophile
[02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:36.340]  rings, all of it. And it's not about getting credit. I'm in a war. I'm totally committed
[02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:42.100]  to beating these people. And I don't want people like Fred Rico Wilson to win when she
[02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:46.620]  says, Oh, we should take all Americans free speech and lock them up and shut them up.
[02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:53.220]  So don't let her win. Go to infowarstore.com today and take advantage of the amazing specials
[02:03:53.220 --> 02:04:00.940]  and get the material to win the second American revolution. Now we're going to go to break.
[02:04:00.940 --> 02:04:05.380]  I'm going to come back and we're going to play this Tommy Robinson interview. Tommy
[02:04:05.380 --> 02:04:09.860]  came here. He begs for your help. You helped him. You spread the word drudge link to it.
[02:04:09.860 --> 02:04:15.620]  The media put up its disinfo against Tommy, but Tommy didn't get a jury trial. And Tommy
[02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:20.580]  is the guy to first expose the giant child kidnapping rings. He's a hero. He can be convicted
[02:04:20.580 --> 02:04:24.740]  bank robber. And if he helped do this, he'd be a hero. They got him on like some off duty
[02:04:24.740 --> 02:04:28.900]  cop started to fight with him. So he beat the guy's ass. You see all the dozens of videos,
[02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:34.620]  the left attacking him, anti for you name it. The guy is a good guy, a wonderful guy.
[02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:39.300]  And he's facing two to three years in solitary confinement, no jury trial, which violates
[02:04:39.300 --> 02:04:46.180]  the law in England. And he needs political asylum here. I say David Knight at the end
[02:04:46.180 --> 02:04:49.540]  of the interview really says some of the most powerful stuff ever. So that's coming up for
[02:04:49.540 --> 02:04:58.980]  two segments and then more breaking information. Robert Barnes, what is big tech become a big
[02:04:58.980 --> 02:05:02.420]  tech or big babies that have become big bullies? And the way they did so is because they face
[02:05:02.420 --> 02:05:06.620]  no consequence of social economic political or legal for their illicit activities over
[02:05:06.620 --> 02:05:10.540]  two decades. And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members
[02:05:10.540 --> 02:05:14.020]  of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public in
[02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:18.380]  the audience that care about this have to bring real social political economic consequence
[02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:21.460]  to their course of conduct. Otherwise, they will never change. And they will become the
[02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:25.500]  big tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century, who ran American
[02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:29.500]  politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover
[02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:33.900]  after the Great Depression. The infamous audience is the fuel that flames the light
[02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:38.500]  of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make
[02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:42.660]  real the original promise of an independent free press. Real collusion is big tech and
[02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:46.940]  big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try
[02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:50.940]  to shake people's thoughts. And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[02:05:50.940 --> 02:05:54.700]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw. Even
[02:05:54.700 --> 02:06:02.340]  it is what you just saw.
[02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:16.860]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:06:16.860 --> 02:06:21.860]  Tommy Robinson is facing certain death. It's been said that we're all Spartacus. We're
[02:06:21.860 --> 02:06:27.260]  all Tommy Robinson. They want to kill him because he exposed the British government's
[02:06:27.260 --> 02:06:33.060]  currency of kidnapped children. He couldn't come on my show today because he's having
[02:06:33.060 --> 02:06:38.700]  a potential last supper with his wife and his three children and family tonight. It's
[02:06:38.700 --> 02:06:43.980]  evening over there. But this morning, he came on the David Knight and gave a very powerful
[02:06:43.980 --> 02:06:48.660]  poignant interview that I hope you'll share with everyone. We're about to post it at
[02:06:48.660 --> 02:06:51.380]  infowars.com. Here it is.
[02:06:51.380 --> 02:06:54.860]  The Muslim gangs were actually being allowed to kidnap our daughters and take them from
[02:06:54.860 --> 02:06:58.980]  the age of 11, prostitute them, rape them. And when families ring the police, the police
[02:06:58.980 --> 02:07:04.620]  do nothing. People didn't believe it until we had a government in-depth report and research
[02:07:04.620 --> 02:07:10.380]  into a town called Rotherham. In this small town, 1,400 children were identified as being
[02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:16.820]  victims of these Muslim pedophile gangs. 20% of the male Muslim population of that town
[02:07:16.820 --> 02:07:23.900]  is currently under police investigation for rape. 20%. The government and the government,
[02:07:23.900 --> 02:07:28.140]  they don't want the British public to be aware of this. They would do anything they can to
[02:07:28.140 --> 02:07:33.620]  cover it up. And they did for 20 to 30 years. When I formed a street movement of tens of
[02:07:33.620 --> 02:07:38.180]  thousands of people marching in towns and cities screaming about our daughters being
[02:07:38.180 --> 02:07:43.740]  taken, only then did the media then report. The media were aware of it. They're all aware
[02:07:43.740 --> 02:07:48.260]  of these crimes. Politicians were aware of it. No one reported them. We basically broke
[02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:52.700]  down political greatness. We smashed it in the face and we went out on the street screaming
[02:07:52.700 --> 02:07:57.100]  and telling the world what they're doing to our daughters in these towns and cities.
[02:07:57.100 --> 02:08:02.660]  Now, just so people understand the scale of the problem, 90% of the convictions of these
[02:08:02.660 --> 02:08:08.980]  gangs for raping these young children are Muslim men. Muslim men only pay up 4% or 5%
[02:08:08.980 --> 02:08:14.740]  of the British population. What Muslims do, 2% of the Muslim men. Now, I went to Leeds
[02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:19.420]  Crown Court and what we see now is where the police have had to start making arrests. They've
[02:08:19.420 --> 02:08:23.460]  started to arrest them all over the country. But what the judges do straight away is they
[02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:29.020]  put a report restriction. So 30 men will be on trial. No one can talk about it. Nine media
[02:08:29.020 --> 02:08:33.380]  are allowed to talk about it. I speak about real issues that affect us in our towns and
[02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:37.780]  cities. And I'm laughed by the people and they hate that. So then this is now the ultimate.
[02:08:37.780 --> 02:08:42.020]  The ultimate is to get rid of me. I'll be put in prison for, do you know, it's a civil
[02:08:42.020 --> 02:08:46.780]  offense. This is a civil offense. I was not allowed a jury. The Magna Carta, common law
[02:08:46.780 --> 02:08:50.740]  says that if you can face more than six months in prison, you'll be tried by 12 members of
[02:08:50.740 --> 02:08:54.140]  your peers. The reason for that is for fair justice.
[02:08:54.140 --> 02:08:57.940]  You don't have a jury. Let's underscore that. You don't have. Trial by jury is one of the
[02:08:57.940 --> 02:09:02.900]  foundations of British common law. Trial by jury, hard one. And that's now been swept
[02:09:02.900 --> 02:09:08.060]  aside in your case, right? I wasn't allowed a jury. I wasn't allowed a jury. So this is
[02:09:08.060 --> 02:09:11.620]  the only thing that they could get through the back door of the Attorney General's government.
[02:09:11.620 --> 02:09:15.780]  They could bring it through the back door to then sentence a man to two years in prison
[02:09:15.780 --> 02:09:20.860]  with no jury. I've been convicted by an appointed judge. A judge who was appointed to a position
[02:09:20.860 --> 02:09:30.260]  two weeks ago. Joining us from the UK is Tommy Robinson.
[02:09:30.260 --> 02:09:35.300]  Thank you for joining us, Tommy. Thank you, David. Tommy, tell us, tell the audience a
[02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:41.020]  little bit about what happened. This goes back to May 18th. Tell us what happened on
[02:09:41.020 --> 02:09:45.580]  that day, but give us a little bit of a background as to what led up to that with the grooming
[02:09:45.580 --> 02:09:50.820]  gangs in the UK that you were trying to report on as a citizen journalist. So on that day,
[02:09:50.820 --> 02:09:56.900]  I was reporting outside Leeds Crown Court on just another gang. We've seen the industrialised
[02:09:56.900 --> 02:10:01.420]  rape of a generation of our daughters. There's been a conspiracy of silence by political
[02:10:01.420 --> 02:10:06.300]  leaders, community leaders, religious leaders. They've all let it happen. And I've been
[02:10:06.300 --> 02:10:10.780]  banging my head and screaming and literally crying about this for over a decade. And when
[02:10:10.780 --> 02:10:14.820]  we first started telling people the stories, the Muslim gangs were actually being allowed
[02:10:14.820 --> 02:10:19.180]  to kidnap our daughters and take them from the age of 11, prostitute them, rape them.
[02:10:19.180 --> 02:10:23.740]  And when families ring the police, the police do nothing, people didn't believe it until
[02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:28.700]  we had a government in-depth report and research into a town called Rotherham. In this small
[02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:35.460]  town, 1,400 children were identified as being victims of these Muslim pedophile gangs. Twenty
[02:10:35.460 --> 02:10:40.420]  percent of the male Muslim population of that town is currently under police investigation
[02:10:40.420 --> 02:10:48.380]  for rape. 20 percent. So when people understand the level of this crime and then these gangs
[02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:53.460]  have been, there's 72 towns and cities now, they operate the same, their actions are the
[02:10:53.460 --> 02:10:57.900]  same, the way they groom the victims are the same, they prostitute and take the girls,
[02:10:57.900 --> 02:11:02.500]  they kidnap them and remove them from one town to another, from one city to another.
[02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:06.140]  And in every one of these towns and cities, the police stood by, the government stood
[02:11:06.140 --> 02:11:10.380]  by, they knew it was happening, they'd done nothing. The reason they'd done nothing, because
[02:11:10.380 --> 02:11:14.500]  they were scared of being deemed as racist, because all the perpetrators were Pakistani
[02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:17.260]  Muslims and all of the victims were young English white girls.
[02:11:17.260 --> 02:11:21.700]  So because they're Muslim, they get a pass on this racketeering on this organized crime
[02:11:21.700 --> 02:11:22.700]  of sex gangs.
[02:11:22.700 --> 02:11:29.100]  We have this globalist agenda of open borders. And then what we do, what I began to do was
[02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:32.860]  tell the reality of actually what it's like when you open the borders for the third world
[02:11:32.860 --> 02:11:36.940]  and when you import millions of people from a different culture, who have completely different
[02:11:36.940 --> 02:11:41.540]  views on women, tolerance of women, their views on different people from different
[02:11:41.540 --> 02:11:46.260]  face, and we see genuine hatred and hostility. I started telling the public about that. Now,
[02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:51.060]  of course, the globalist agenda and the government, they don't want the British public to be aware
[02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:52.060]  of this.
[02:11:52.060 --> 02:11:56.460]  They would do anything they can to cover it up. And they did for 20 to 30 years. When
[02:11:56.460 --> 02:12:02.260]  I formed a street movement of tens of thousands of people marching in towns and cities, screaming
[02:12:02.260 --> 02:12:07.820]  about our daughters being taken, only then did the media then report. The media were
[02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:11.740]  aware of it. They were all aware of these tip crimes. Politicians were aware of it. No
[02:12:11.740 --> 02:12:12.740]  one reported them.
[02:12:12.740 --> 02:12:16.660]  We basically broke down political greatness, we smashed it in the face, and we went out
[02:12:16.660 --> 02:12:20.940]  on the street screaming and telling the world what they're doing to our daughters in these
[02:12:20.940 --> 02:12:27.500]  towns and cities. Now, just so people understand the scale of the problem, 90% of the convictions
[02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:33.620]  of these gangs for raping these young children are Muslim men. Muslim men only pay up 4%
[02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:39.900]  or 5% of the British population, or Muslims do, 2% of the Muslim men. Now, I went to Leeds
[02:12:39.900 --> 02:12:44.180]  Crown Court, and what we see now is where the police have had to start making arrests.
[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:48.460]  They've started to arrest them all over the country. But what the judges do straight away
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:52.780]  is they put a reporting restriction. So 30 men will be on trial, and no one can talk
[02:12:52.780 --> 02:12:57.140]  about it. None media are allowed to talk about it. So what I've done is I started looking
[02:12:57.140 --> 02:13:01.660]  and researching all these cases, as I've done for years. I looked, I knew there was a case
[02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:05.860]  on elite. I'd heard there was a reporting restriction, but there's no national website
[02:13:05.860 --> 02:13:09.980]  to check if there's a reporting restriction. There's nothing. So I'd heard, I traveled
[02:13:09.980 --> 02:13:14.060]  up to Leeds, I went into the court and said, is there a reporting restriction on this case?
[02:13:14.060 --> 02:13:18.260]  I was told by the man who come to court and testified that he wasn't aware of one. He
[02:13:18.260 --> 02:13:23.260]  didn't know. I then looked, at that point, I looked on the court website, where the list
[02:13:23.260 --> 02:13:28.140]  of names are. And in that list of names, there was no mention of a reporting restriction.
[02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:33.780]  No mention at all. And on the judiciary's own website, the government's judiciary website,
[02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:43.340]  there's 27 page document of no 40 page document that gives the guidelines for media and journalists.
[02:13:43.340 --> 02:13:49.500]  This is the, this is the guidelines for contempt of court for reporting restrictions. So I previously
[02:13:49.500 --> 02:13:54.420]  paid myself to go to the leading law firm in London to get training because I didn't
[02:13:54.420 --> 02:13:58.860]  qualify as a journalist. I'm a citizen journalist. So I went for training on contempt of court
[02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:03.660]  to understand the laws and boundaries of what I can and can't say where I can say it. In
[02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:09.900]  my training that I had on reporting restrictions, I was already aware that a judge has no power.
[02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:16.300]  And this is still now, if you go on the website now, Google reporting restrictions, criminal
[02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:22.180]  courts, go to page 27, you will read, a judge has no power under section 42 of reporting
[02:14:22.180 --> 02:14:27.860]  restriction to put any restrictions on information already in the public domain. So when I got
[02:14:27.860 --> 02:14:32.020]  to Leeds, I was aware of a lot of the details of this case. I was aware of the previous
[02:14:32.020 --> 02:14:37.300]  verdicts, but to make sure that I couldn't fall foul of the law, even though there was
[02:14:37.300 --> 02:14:42.100]  no mention of reporting restriction anywhere, the guidelines say that if there's a reporting
[02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:45.980]  restriction, it must be on the website. It must be on the courtroom door. It must be
[02:14:45.980 --> 02:14:51.620]  on the screen in the courtroom. It was nowhere. It's been proven that they had failed three
[02:14:51.620 --> 02:14:57.700]  procedures to alert people of the reporting restriction. But I still stuck to with the
[02:14:57.700 --> 02:15:02.300]  training that I've received that says only reveal information that's in the public domain.
[02:15:02.300 --> 02:15:06.060]  Do you know what they said in court? Don't they said David?
[02:15:06.060 --> 02:15:07.060]  No way they say it.
[02:15:07.060 --> 02:15:13.620]  The information on the judiciary website is wrong. Now, if you go now, if you go now and
[02:15:13.620 --> 02:15:20.380]  look on the judiciary website, there is a foreword, a foreword by the law chief justice
[02:15:20.380 --> 02:15:28.660]  himself, and he thanked illegal chambers for the legal accuracy of the judiciary website.
[02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:31.700]  So and then this is where they just make it up as they go along.
[02:15:31.700 --> 02:15:35.540]  Now, folks, it gets really powerful when he comes back about last dinner with his children,
[02:15:35.540 --> 02:15:38.340]  what he's facing, what they've done to him in prison. I understand. This is how they
[02:15:38.340 --> 02:15:44.940]  kill journalism. He went and covered a trial outside. He's facing years in solitary confinement,
[02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:50.260]  no jury trial. When the law in the UK is more than six months in jail, you get a jury trial.
[02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:52.260]  This is tyranny.
[02:16:50.260 --> 02:16:55.260]  Like Amazon or Walmart and search today for Sonny Bay.

[02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:09.580]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Every information I read was in the public domain.
[02:20:09.580 --> 02:20:14.060]  I was taken off the street there and then and I was imprisoned for 13 months without
[02:20:14.060 --> 02:20:18.980]  any due process without asking if I was guilty or not guilty without a trial without being
[02:20:18.980 --> 02:20:23.740]  told what I've done. So they took me off the street instantly put me in prison. Now a free
[02:20:23.740 --> 02:20:28.460]  tommy movement grew. They tried to prevent the public from even knowing I was in prison
[02:20:28.460 --> 02:20:33.460]  I'm thankful and grateful to everyone in America, everyone in Australia, everyone in Canada who
[02:20:33.460 --> 02:20:37.260]  because of reporting restrictions they've in place they've in place these report restrictions
[02:20:37.260 --> 02:20:41.580]  that no one could be told what happened to me. Now because of the foreign media interest
[02:20:41.580 --> 02:20:48.380]  in this, a free tommy movement grew. Then there was a campaign and legal fund to get
[02:20:48.380 --> 02:20:52.460]  me out. We got on appeal after two and a half months. I spent two and a half months on soldier
[02:20:52.460 --> 02:20:58.820]  confinement. I lost 40 pounds in weight. I was then released from prison and they accepted
[02:20:58.820 --> 02:21:02.700]  in the highest court in our land. They accepted that everything they done was wrong. It was
[02:21:02.700 --> 02:21:07.420]  flawed. I was released for this reason. They then took me back to the old Bailey. I went
[02:21:07.420 --> 02:21:13.820]  for another judge. I produced my evidence of statement. He kicked it back to the government
[02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:20.820]  again. The Attorney General sat on it for five months only after I produced the documentary
[02:21:20.820 --> 02:21:26.180]  which categorically proved evidence with undercover footage that the BBC programme panorama was
[02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:30.860]  inventing news, fake news, creating sexual allegations against myself. I showed it all
[02:21:30.860 --> 02:21:35.620]  in the biggest expose of the BBC this country seen. I'll be sent to prison tomorrow as a
[02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:44.780]  journalist for reporting the crime of journalism. You give asylum to Cubans. You give asylum
[02:21:44.780 --> 02:21:49.860]  to people who are journalists. My life is in danger. It's not a joke. It's seriously
[02:21:49.860 --> 02:21:55.060]  in danger. The lies that are told about me, I have exposed and embarrassed the British
[02:21:55.060 --> 02:21:59.020]  government and the establishment. The establishment who are intent on the destruction of our culture
[02:21:59.020 --> 02:22:03.180]  and our nation. All of these issues, I've embarrassed them by highlighting the crimes.
[02:22:03.180 --> 02:22:08.220]  I've become the most watched journalist in the UK and that's scared. I terrify the establishment
[02:22:08.220 --> 02:22:13.220]  and my support that grew terrified because I speak the truth with honesty. I speak about
[02:22:13.220 --> 02:22:18.580]  real issues that affect us in our towns and cities and I'm loved by the people. They hate
[02:22:18.580 --> 02:22:23.140]  us. This is now the ultimate, the ultimate is to get rid of me. I'll be put in prison
[02:22:23.140 --> 02:22:28.460]  for, do you know, it's a civil offence. This is a civil offence. I was not allowed a jury.
[02:22:28.460 --> 02:22:32.220]  The Magna Carta of common law says that if you can face more than six months in prison,
[02:22:32.220 --> 02:22:36.940]  you'll be tried by 12 members of your peers. The reason for that is for fair justice.
[02:22:36.940 --> 02:22:41.820]  You don't have a jury. Let's underscore that. Trial by jury is one of the foundations of
[02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:46.700]  British common law. Trial by jury, hard won and that's now been swept aside in your case,
[02:22:46.700 --> 02:22:51.940]  right? I wasn't allowed a jury. I wasn't allowed a jury. So this is the only thing that they
[02:22:51.940 --> 02:22:54.860]  could get through the back door of the Attorney General's government. They could bring it
[02:22:54.860 --> 02:23:00.260]  through the back door to then sentence a man to two years in prison with no jury. I've been
[02:23:00.260 --> 02:23:05.100]  convicted by an appointed judge. A judge who was appointed to her position two weeks ago.
[02:23:05.100 --> 02:23:09.820]  A boy who was in her position two weeks ago. She has been appointed and she's about to,
[02:23:09.820 --> 02:23:13.180]  and do you know what? Anyone can look at this, look at the video of what I've done outside
[02:23:13.180 --> 02:23:17.220]  the Leeds Crown Court, and you will see the lies yourself in what the judge is saying.
[02:23:17.220 --> 02:23:22.900]  This, with careful examination, this case proves the corruption of the judicial system
[02:23:22.900 --> 02:23:28.060]  in the UK. It proves the lies being propagated and told, the lies being put out in sentences
[02:23:28.060 --> 02:23:31.980]  which are then spread around the world by the corporate, globalist media, the fake news
[02:23:31.980 --> 02:23:36.300]  media, which are lying to the public about who I am, the man I am, the crime I've committed.
[02:23:36.300 --> 02:23:40.540]  I didn't know he would prejudice any jury. That's been proven. The lies that are being
[02:23:40.540 --> 02:23:45.020]  said, I've committed no crime. It's a non-crime. And I'd better be locked up and imprisoned
[02:23:45.020 --> 02:23:49.300]  and probably murdered at the hands of ISIS terrorists who are in control of our prison
[02:23:49.300 --> 02:23:54.060]  system. This is a warning to the United States. Your prison systems will be used. The most
[02:23:54.060 --> 02:23:58.180]  weak and vulnerable people in your society, the people who have been wronged all their
[02:23:58.180 --> 02:24:02.300]  life, the poorest people living in poverty, who will then end up in prison when they're
[02:24:02.300 --> 02:24:06.660]  weak and they're vulnerable. And ideology will inset in that prison system. It will
[02:24:06.660 --> 02:24:11.700]  grow and it will breed. And it's happening in ours. They've taken over our entire prison
[02:24:11.700 --> 02:24:16.420]  system. Car thieves are going into jail and they're coming out radical jihadis. That's
[02:24:16.420 --> 02:24:19.940]  going to happen to yours and nothing's being done to prevent it. And I'm going to be fed
[02:24:19.940 --> 02:24:25.900]  like a lamb to slaughter in that prison system that's controlled by jihadis. It's controlled
[02:24:25.900 --> 02:24:29.780]  by them. And I'm a journalist. I'm a man who loves my country. I love free speech. I've
[02:24:29.780 --> 02:24:36.100]  been convicted for exercising your first amendment. If you care about freedom, if you care, you're
[02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:41.140]  given asylum to people from different cultures from you, who don't even love your country.
[02:24:41.140 --> 02:24:46.020]  I love the United States of America. I love Donald Trump. I absolutely love him. If there's
[02:24:46.020 --> 02:24:50.700]  one person I admire more than anyone in the world is that man. It's a world war for freedom
[02:24:50.700 --> 02:24:54.300]  and we're losing. We're losing and we've lost it in England. We've lost it. We've lost free
[02:24:54.300 --> 02:24:58.660]  speech. We've lost it. It's gone. And now we've lost the freedom of the press. It's
[02:24:58.660 --> 02:25:02.420]  gone. And the reality, we haven't even got democracy. Look at Brexit. We haven't even
[02:25:02.420 --> 02:25:05.580]  got democracy and people are waking up and realizing that. Unfortunately, I'm going to
[02:25:05.580 --> 02:25:09.500]  have to go. I've got to collect my kids from school. This is my last night with my children.
[02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:13.540]  I'm going to have to kiss my kids goodbye with their never welcome I could die in this prison
[02:25:13.540 --> 02:25:20.300]  sentence for asking Muslim pedophiles how they feel about their verdict, causing them anxiety.
[02:25:20.300 --> 02:25:21.300]  That's the reality.
[02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:24.460]  Well, I'm so sorry to hear that happening. And again, I know that you want to spend as
[02:25:24.460 --> 02:25:28.940]  much time with your kids as possible. Very serious situation. And we'll do everything
[02:25:28.940 --> 02:25:32.860]  that we can to draw attention to this. I do not want to see this happen. It's horrible
[02:25:32.860 --> 02:25:36.580]  what's happening in the UK is being done here in the United States as well. Thank you, Tommy.
[02:25:36.580 --> 02:25:41.340]  Again, you can find him PR news. What Tommy Robinson was pointing out is that he was
[02:25:41.340 --> 02:25:48.580]  at the nexus of this fraud that is being perpetrated by the people who've opened up our borders
[02:25:48.580 --> 02:25:53.980]  because they pretend that they are all about defending women. And yet they bring in people
[02:25:53.980 --> 02:26:01.020]  with cultures, foreign cultures that do everything they can to treat women as chattel property,
[02:26:01.020 --> 02:26:05.980]  running rape gangs and so forth. And that's what they don't want people to understand.
[02:26:05.980 --> 02:26:11.100]  They don't want, as I've said many times in the past, you've got the Democrats here saying,
[02:26:11.100 --> 02:26:16.100]  oh, look, you can't say anything about Islam now on social media. They're now protected,
[02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:20.220]  protected class of people. They say, well, this is general, no criticism of any of any
[02:26:20.220 --> 02:26:24.220]  religious groups. Don't tell me they're going to protect Christians from being criticized
[02:26:24.220 --> 02:26:30.060]  by LGBT. We don't want their protection, quite frankly. We can handle the criticism. I don't
[02:26:30.060 --> 02:26:37.100]  need to be protected from criticism by atheists or criticism by the LGBT or criticism by Muslims.
[02:26:37.100 --> 02:26:40.820]  And I don't think that they should be protected if I have any criticisms to say about what
[02:26:40.820 --> 02:26:46.540]  they're doing or about their culture. But of course, our culture has to be destroyed.
[02:26:46.540 --> 02:26:50.620]  And that's what they're doing with this. They don't want people to see what is ultimately
[02:26:50.620 --> 02:26:56.820]  going to happen. I said this when I was covering the DNC back in 2016. I went there for their
[02:26:56.820 --> 02:27:02.980]  convention. And I said, look at this, you've got Hillary Clinton, and they're talking about
[02:27:02.980 --> 02:27:08.420]  women's rights and feminism and gay rights. And then they bring up people who support
[02:27:08.420 --> 02:27:14.660]  Sharia law. I said, these two things are going to be an explosive mix. And it is inevitable
[02:27:14.660 --> 02:27:19.140]  that the kind of things that are happening in the UK now, as Tommy Robinson pointed out,
[02:27:19.140 --> 02:27:25.300]  Muslim men, four to 5% of the population, but 90% of the convictions of these sex gangs
[02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:30.940]  that are grooming and kidnapping women there, it is a cultural thing. And they don't want
[02:27:30.940 --> 02:27:34.740]  you to see that connection. They don't want you to see what's happening. And it is a kangaroo
[02:27:34.740 --> 02:27:39.620]  court proceeding. They don't have a First Amendment in the UK, but they have a cherished
[02:27:39.620 --> 02:27:47.260]  tradition of trial by jury. Our courts, our judiciary in this country, have managed to
[02:27:47.260 --> 02:27:51.300]  gaslight the American people about how, oh, you don't want jury trials. They gaslight
[02:27:51.300 --> 02:27:55.500]  juries, juries don't even know if you have a jury. David Knight knocks it out of the
[02:27:55.500 --> 02:28:00.980]  park. The full interview is a few months left is on info wars.com and news wars.com. It's
[02:28:00.980 --> 02:28:06.980]  Tommy Robinson's last interview before facing prison for journalism. Please get it out.
[02:28:06.980 --> 02:28:12.900]  It's very important. Now there it is for TV viewers. We have Alex Acosta, who's one of
[02:28:12.900 --> 02:28:20.820]  the secretaries is labor under Trump. The only connection to Trump and Epstein is that
[02:28:20.820 --> 02:28:26.900]  under a previous administration, this guy went along with the FBI's directive to basically
[02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:32.940]  let Epstein off because he was working for Robert Mueller, who's a bipartisan blackmailer.
[02:28:32.940 --> 02:28:36.020]  And so we've got his press conference coming up as soon as it goes live. We'll take the
[02:28:36.020 --> 02:28:40.140]  first part of it. Norm Patis constitutional lawyer is going to pop in with a big court
[02:28:40.140 --> 02:28:44.740]  victory we have that mainstream media doesn't want you to know about and so much more. But
[02:28:44.740 --> 02:28:49.900]  whatever you do, remember info wars.com is tomorrow's news today. Tell everybody about
[02:28:49.900 --> 02:28:58.020]  the local AM and FM stations are listening to attention GCN self reliance listeners.
[02:28:58.020 --> 02:29:02.500]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system, but we're waiting for prices
[02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:06.820]  too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear. Bill Hyde
[02:29:06.820 --> 02:29:11.420]  here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX micro
[02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:15.860]  grid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[02:29:15.860 --> 02:29:19.940]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east
[02:29:19.940 --> 02:29:23.940]  bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to
[02:29:23.940 --> 02:29:27.840]  a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd
[02:29:27.840 --> 02:29:32.180]  offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the flood
[02:29:32.180 --> 02:29:36.140]  waters backstory. So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX micro grid
[02:29:36.140 --> 02:29:42.740]  system at my own power grid dot com. That's my own power grid dot com over $1000 in great

[02:30:03.500 --> 02:30:09.060]  really mean? It means the idea of American freedom renaissance worldwide doesn't mean
[02:30:09.060 --> 02:30:15.580]  we go conquer countries. It means our superior Western values of true freedom get adopted
[02:30:15.580 --> 02:30:21.860]  because compared to globalism, it's night and day. We're going to do a 34 hour special

[02:30:55.860 --> 02:31:03.260]  Info wars, the most banned network in the world viewers and listeners. I wouldn't be
[02:31:03.260 --> 02:31:08.300]  here if it wasn't for you and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[02:31:08.300 --> 02:31:12.020]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how
[02:31:12.020 --> 02:31:16.220]  much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things
[02:31:16.220 --> 02:31:19.500]  you can say about people that you knew they were liars. You went and looked it up and
[02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:23.860]  found out the truth. And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I
[02:31:23.860 --> 02:31:27.580]  feel your love in my heart. I want you know that love is right back at you and I want
[02:31:27.580 --> 02:31:31.420]  to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial
[02:31:31.420 --> 02:31:36.380]  support because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win. And without you,
[02:31:36.380 --> 02:31:40.300]  I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun. But that's not what's important.
[02:31:40.300 --> 02:31:44.940]  The enemy could win. We're a key chess piece in this fight. We're being used by God. You're
[02:31:44.940 --> 02:31:48.980]  being used by God. This is Providence. So I salute you and I thank you for all you've
[02:31:48.980 --> 02:31:56.500]  done from the bottom of my heart. Info wars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:31:56.500 --> 02:32:03.340]  As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom, we remember that all share a truly extraordinary
[02:32:03.340 --> 02:32:10.740]  heritage. Together we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America.
[02:32:10.740 --> 02:32:16.140]  It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they
[02:32:16.140 --> 02:32:23.860]  know is right and what they know is true. As long as we stay true to our cause, as long
[02:32:23.860 --> 02:32:30.140]  as we remember our great history, as long as we never, ever stop fighting for a better
[02:32:30.140 --> 02:32:46.780]  future, then there will be nothing that America cannot do.

[02:32:51.980 --> 02:32:59.460]  Full power. Damn the torpedoes. Go straight, Adam.
[02:32:59.460 --> 02:33:28.860]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:28.860 --> 02:33:36.000]  Info wars has got a satellite feed. Yeah, we've got the full setup. Inside the Justice
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:42.180]  Department right now. To the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance,
[02:33:42.180 --> 02:33:53.700]  you're listening to Alex Jones. And here comes the Trump administration official, Alexander
[02:33:53.700 --> 02:34:04.940]  Acosta, Department of Labor on the whole Epstein scandal. Here it is.
[02:34:04.940 --> 02:34:12.180]  Let me start by reiterating that I'm pleased that the New York prosecution is going forward.
[02:34:12.180 --> 02:34:17.020]  They brought these charges based on new evidence against Jeffrey Epstein, who is now a registered
[02:34:17.020 --> 02:34:25.100]  sex offender, and this is a very, very good thing. His acts are despicable, and the New
[02:34:25.100 --> 02:34:34.300]  York prosecution offers an important opportunity to more fully bring Epstein to justice. In
[02:34:34.300 --> 02:34:44.180]  2008, a major newspaper described the Epstein prosecution like this. A Florida grand jury
[02:34:44.180 --> 02:34:49.860]  that is a grand jury convened by the district attorney of Palm Beach County had charged
[02:34:49.860 --> 02:34:56.620]  Epstein with a lesser offense. At that time, the Epstein legal team was elated. He would
[02:34:56.620 --> 02:35:02.380]  have avoided prison altogether. But then the United States Attorney's Office in Miami
[02:35:02.380 --> 02:35:08.700]  became involved. Epstein got an ultimatum, plead guilty to a charge that would require
[02:35:08.700 --> 02:35:17.860]  jail time and registration, or face federal charges. And that was the week more than 10
[02:35:17.860 --> 02:35:24.660]  years ago that Epstein went to jail. Times have changed, and coverage of this case has
[02:35:24.660 --> 02:35:32.940]  certainly changed since that article. Facts are important, and facts are being overlooked.
[02:35:32.940 --> 02:35:39.460]  This matter started as a state matter. It was prosecuted initially by the state of Florida
[02:35:39.460 --> 02:35:46.820]  and not by the U.S. Attorney's Office. In 2006, a grand jury convened by the state attorney,
[02:35:46.820 --> 02:35:51.940]  the district attorney of Palm Beach County, reviewed the evidence and recommended a single
[02:35:51.940 --> 02:35:59.220]  charge, and that charge would have resulted in no jail time, no restitution to the victim.
[02:35:59.220 --> 02:36:07.540]  Further, the state attorney's office allowed Epstein to self-surrender and arraigned him
[02:36:07.540 --> 02:36:14.060]  the following morning. Simply put, the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office was ready to
[02:36:14.060 --> 02:36:22.900]  let Epstein walk free. No jail time. Nothing. Prosecutors in my former office found this
[02:36:22.900 --> 02:36:29.260]  to be completely unacceptable, and they became involved. Our office became involved. Our
[02:36:29.260 --> 02:36:36.620]  prosecutors, as this 2008 article recounts, presented the ultimatum, plead guilty to more
[02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:43.860]  serious charges, charges that required jail time, registration, and restitution, or redroll
[02:36:43.860 --> 02:36:51.580]  the dice and bring a federal indictment. Without the work of our prosecutors, Epstein
[02:36:51.580 --> 02:36:58.900]  would have gotten away with just that state charge. Now, many today question the terms
[02:36:58.900 --> 02:37:05.660]  of that ultimatum, what's called the non-prosecution agreement. A good prosecutor will tell you
[02:37:05.660 --> 02:37:11.700]  that these cases are complex, especially when they involve children, and even more so in
[02:37:11.700 --> 02:37:17.980]  2006. I've shared with those in this room today and will make available publicly. And
[02:37:17.980 --> 02:37:25.100]  after David filed by the career prosecutor in a civil matter related to the Epstein case,
[02:37:25.100 --> 02:37:33.020]  she talks about the challenges faced. She talks about the victims being scared and traumatized,
[02:37:33.020 --> 02:37:42.260]  refusing to testify, and how some victims actually exonerated Epstein. Most had significant
[02:37:42.260 --> 02:37:49.740]  concerns about their identities being revealed. The acts that they had faced were horrible,
[02:37:49.740 --> 02:37:57.340]  and they didn't want people to know about them. And she goes on to write that, quote,
[02:37:57.340 --> 02:38:03.900]  after the fact, people alleged that Epstein would have been easily convicted. As the prosecutor
[02:38:03.900 --> 02:38:10.660]  who handled the investigation, she says in this affidavit, these contentions overlooked
[02:38:10.660 --> 02:38:17.660]  the facts that existed at the time. Her description of these facts are corroborated
[02:38:17.660 --> 02:38:25.460]  by the FBI case agent, who's after David I've also shared today. Thousands of prosecutors
[02:38:25.460 --> 02:38:35.460]  around the nation this week are weighing guilty pleas versus trials. These cases, have I said,
[02:38:35.460 --> 02:38:41.700]  are hard. They require prosecutor to ask whether a plea that guarantees jail time.
[02:38:41.700 --> 02:38:45.900]  All right, let's fade this down for a moment, because I had my great famous constitutional
[02:38:45.900 --> 02:38:51.660]  and defense lawyer and free speech lawyer, Norm Patis, set up to talk about very big
[02:38:51.660 --> 02:38:57.260]  developments in the whole Sandy Hook anti-free speech move by the deep state of the Democrats.
[02:38:57.260 --> 02:39:01.220]  But he's also worked in a lot of big cases and can speak to this. And so I'll get his
[02:39:01.220 --> 02:39:04.700]  take on it. Obviously, we'll come out in the next seven and get to some of the questions.
[02:39:04.700 --> 02:39:09.220]  This is going to be Donald Trump ordered you to cover this up. This was over a decade ago.
[02:39:09.220 --> 02:39:13.580]  Nothing to do with Trump. It was bipartisan deal. I think because it was so high powered,
[02:39:13.580 --> 02:39:18.860]  it did get covered up. You heard by the state, the feds put did something. I'm not defending
[02:39:18.860 --> 02:39:25.780]  Alexander Acosta. I mean, Epstein was US intelligence, FBI. It ties into all of it, folks. And it's
[02:39:25.780 --> 02:39:30.900]  all coming out. But to make this guy the bad guy, to make this guy who's like separated
[02:39:30.900 --> 02:39:35.900]  by thousands of degrees the bad guy and to make Trump the thing. I'm not here to defend
[02:39:35.900 --> 02:39:40.060]  Trump. I get persecuted because of Trump. I mean, but it just, there's nothing there.
[02:39:40.060 --> 02:39:45.340]  You've got Schumer gave thousands or got thousands of donations from Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:39:45.340 --> 02:39:51.060]  His aid to camp wiener was obviously a procure for Epstein. That's come out. So bringing
[02:39:51.060 --> 02:39:54.700]  in Norm Patis, famous constitutional lawyer, one of the top guys in the country. What do
[02:39:54.700 --> 02:39:58.220]  you make of this train wreck? What do you think of what's unfolding here? I know you
[02:39:58.220 --> 02:40:01.620]  weren't coming on about this. We're coming on about your big one in a million appeal
[02:40:01.620 --> 02:40:06.900]  being accepted to the Supreme Court, which even the Connecticut news, this is unheard
[02:40:06.900 --> 02:40:11.100]  of in my case. And we'll talk about the next time. But what do you make of what's happening
[02:40:11.100 --> 02:40:15.580]  here? I don't. I mean, it's ridiculous. You know, the thing to the matter is that there
[02:40:15.580 --> 02:40:20.860]  are a lot of, you know, we're a nation of sexophanics. We use sex to sell every product
[02:40:20.860 --> 02:40:25.660]  when somebody colors outside the little bit in the lines we turn on. Epstein, if the allegations
[02:40:25.660 --> 02:40:30.300]  are true, had an appetite for young women. He surfaced on prosecutorial radar. He cut
[02:40:30.300 --> 02:40:36.540]  a deal. The prosecution at that time weighed the risks and costs of going forward, including
[02:40:36.540 --> 02:40:44.860]  the cost to the young women having to testify publicly and cut a deal with Epstein. That
[02:40:44.860 --> 02:40:49.500]  was a deal cut 10 years ago to politicize it now and say that it reflects some broader
[02:40:49.500 --> 02:40:54.780]  ideological current is the height of irresponsibility. It's ridiculous. It shows just how far things
[02:40:54.780 --> 02:40:58.980]  have gone in this country to politicize it. No, no, I agree. But so, so why is it Bill
[02:40:58.980 --> 02:41:03.580]  Clinton doing a press conference or why aren't people on the airplane doing it? Why is it
[02:41:03.580 --> 02:41:07.220]  the former U.S. attorney when the Democrats came to him and said, we're going to know
[02:41:07.220 --> 02:41:10.860]  Bill this. And he said, well, at least give us something, put him in jail for at least
[02:41:10.860 --> 02:41:16.460]  a year. How does it turn into he's the bad guy? I don't get that candidly. Alex, I don't
[02:41:16.460 --> 02:41:21.460]  either, you know, and I'll be honest with you. The story is so unimpressive to me. I've
[02:41:21.460 --> 02:41:25.460]  not paid any attention to it at all. The first I'd listened to it was listening to a waiting
[02:41:25.460 --> 02:41:29.660]  on to come on to talk about something else. I'm involved in plea bargains every day in
[02:41:29.660 --> 02:41:35.700]  cases, obviously, that are not often as significant as this plea. Marketing is an ugly business.
[02:41:35.700 --> 02:41:40.620]  People would they rate the way the risks of going forward against the cost and take what
[02:41:40.620 --> 02:41:45.180]  they can get. It looked like justice 10 years ago today. It's the holy war. I feel bad for
[02:41:45.180 --> 02:41:52.140]  Epstein, frankly. Epstein, you think he's been sucked into something larger?
[02:41:52.140 --> 02:41:58.700]  You know, I defend people. That's what I do. That's how I'm put together. I'm reading the
[02:41:58.700 --> 02:42:04.500]  papers and I'm thinking, you know, what do they know today that they didn't know then?
[02:42:04.500 --> 02:42:10.020]  I'm wondering whether there's a way to leverage the prior plea into a quieting of the waters.
[02:42:10.020 --> 02:42:15.140]  I don't want to be portrayed as somebody who's going out to defend sex offenders. I defend
[02:42:15.140 --> 02:42:19.420]  people against charges. He cut a deal with the government a decade ago. What makes this
[02:42:19.420 --> 02:42:25.260]  new news today? I'm not sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. The Democrats
[02:42:25.260 --> 02:42:30.020]  made up a bunch of Jane Doe's with Epstein. He didn't do it against Trump. So Trump's
[02:42:30.020 --> 02:42:34.980]  got to fight back. But I see. Well, that's probably true. Although, you know, when you
[02:42:34.980 --> 02:42:40.260]  politicize criminal justice, that's the most dangerous thing that you can do. Giving prosecutors
[02:42:40.260 --> 02:42:44.580]  unlimited discretion or, you know, to prosecute, whenever they choose for whatever reason they
[02:42:44.580 --> 02:42:49.460]  choose is the height of a due process violation. I hear what you're saying. Let's shift gears
[02:42:49.460 --> 02:42:55.220]  into this big win, this big case when we come back. Stay with us.
[02:42:55.220 --> 02:43:00.900]  The second American revolution is happening now. It's worldwide against the globalist,
[02:43:00.900 --> 02:43:07.020]  the American system versus the anti-human, anti-God world government. Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:43:07.020 --> 02:43:11.500]  any war to be successful needs funding and we make it easy. That's where we're launching
[02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:19.180]  our biggest sell yet, 1776 worldwide, bigger than our Christmas specials. 75% off is the
[02:43:19.180 --> 02:43:25.940]  best deals with a lot of our best selling items that price down to 25% off. And on top
[02:43:25.940 --> 02:43:33.940]  of it, we have a dozen items, including all apparel for 1776. So stock up and fund the

[02:43:41.940 --> 02:43:46.380]  for your support. The globalist hope you don't. Whatever you do, choose what side you're
[02:43:46.380 --> 02:43:56.060]  on and take action.
[02:43:56.060 --> 02:44:00.060]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're
[02:44:00.060 --> 02:44:03.940]  going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago,
[02:44:03.940 --> 02:44:07.220]  before all the censorship of attacks and fake lawsuits, the rest of it, I would talk about
[02:44:07.220 --> 02:44:10.940]  how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and I'd have doctors
[02:44:10.940 --> 02:44:14.180]  on an experts to explain why they were so good. And instead the last few years, I'm
[02:44:14.180 --> 02:44:17.540]  like, Hey, we need to really support us. Are they'll shut us down? The biggest thing people
[02:44:17.540 --> 02:44:20.180]  like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they
[02:44:20.180 --> 02:44:25.340]  were. And the left always has headlines everywhere. Jones sells unapproved supplements that he
[02:44:25.340 --> 02:44:31.300]  claims are supplements. No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement
[02:44:31.300 --> 02:44:34.660]  has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it. But
[02:44:34.660 --> 02:44:39.060]  then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying
[02:44:39.060 --> 02:44:42.740]  to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things. And a lot of drugs
[02:44:42.740 --> 02:44:46.660]  work great. They have side effects, not with mother nature, but big pharma doesn't want
[02:44:46.660 --> 02:44:53.100]  you knowing about God's medicine chest infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three,

[02:46:02.860 --> 02:46:08.420]  are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war. Borders are being

[02:47:13.340 --> 02:47:38.340]  I'm Alex Jones and I'll see you in the next video.
[02:30:56.280 --> 02:47:58.340]  and they said, these are the four points that you will have to do in state
[02:47:58.340 --> 02:48:08.460]  court. And if not, we will proceed federally. They were very serious that they would proceed
[02:48:08.460 --> 02:48:14.020]  federally. That does not mean that they were confident in the final outcome. And one of
[02:48:14.020 --> 02:48:22.260]  the tough questions in these cases, what is the value of a secured guilty plea with registration
[02:48:22.260 --> 02:48:29.020]  versus rolling the dice? And I know that in 2019 looking back on 2008, things may look
[02:48:29.020 --> 02:48:33.580]  different. But this was the judgment of prosecutors.
[02:48:33.580 --> 02:48:38.780]  That's the 27th United States Secretary of Labor, Alexander Acosta. And we haven't gotten
[02:48:38.780 --> 02:48:42.220]  to the press conference part where they'll definitely try to blame Trump. You ask why
[02:48:42.220 --> 02:48:48.100]  is Epstein getting re indicted? Because Hillary and the Democrats kept trying to say Trump
[02:48:48.100 --> 02:48:52.060]  was involved in all this and tried to blame a bunch of people. And so lawsuits got filed
[02:48:52.060 --> 02:48:56.620]  to get the documents to show they weren't. And it's reopened at all. So that's where
[02:48:56.620 --> 02:49:00.740]  all this is going. Now getting back here, I'm gonna host about 15 minutes the next hour
[02:49:00.740 --> 02:49:05.100]  than Mike Adams is going to take over in the war rooms at three o'clock. We have development
[02:49:05.100 --> 02:49:09.140]  so huge here today that when I was talking to some of the top constitutional lawyers
[02:49:09.140 --> 02:49:15.100]  in the country, like Norm Pattis, like Mark Rondaza, like Robert Barnes and many others.
[02:49:15.100 --> 02:49:18.140]  I had other lawyers calling me today that I had to call back. I don't even know that
[02:49:18.140 --> 02:49:23.980]  are well known saying, well, we didn't believe it when we saw that Facebook had changed its
[02:49:23.980 --> 02:49:28.500]  terms of service. And believe me, that doesn't just happen. Terms of services like the Holy
[02:49:28.500 --> 02:49:35.740]  Grail at a big tech company to say that you can incite people to kill somebody. If they're
[02:49:35.740 --> 02:49:41.860]  labeled a dangerous person, which I've been labeled. Now they they changed it update Facebook
[02:49:41.860 --> 02:49:46.220]  deletes policy allowing violent threats against dangerous individuals. I could talk for 20
[02:49:46.220 --> 02:49:52.020]  years about this. Just this, this is how insane it's gotten. But then we've got this other
[02:49:52.020 --> 02:49:57.500]  incredible development. I remember talking to Norm Pattis. You know, three, four weeks
[02:49:57.500 --> 02:50:01.820]  ago when I did not threaten the lawyers on the other side of the Sandy Hook. I did not
[02:50:01.820 --> 02:50:06.020]  say they sent me the child porn. I said I was angry at them, but I said whoever did it,
[02:50:06.020 --> 02:50:09.100]  there's a big reward for who did it. Well, they went to the judge and said I said it
[02:50:09.100 --> 02:50:15.100]  was them. The media said I said it was them. And the judge threw out my anti slap, which
[02:50:15.100 --> 02:50:18.940]  would have allowed me to throw it out right away. Well, even the Connecticut news, the
[02:50:18.940 --> 02:50:24.900]  current.com says unheard of one in a million that they said they can't even find cases
[02:50:24.900 --> 02:50:28.420]  where this has really happened, especially in one like this. It's going to Connecticut
[02:50:28.420 --> 02:50:33.820]  Supreme Court, not after the case before the case. And so Norm Pattis, congratulations
[02:50:33.820 --> 02:50:39.620]  on the fact that you told me you said, listen, it's a political case, obviously, but the
[02:50:39.620 --> 02:50:44.100]  law is 100% clear and we just have to do this. Are you for it? And I said, hell, of course
[02:50:44.100 --> 02:50:49.780]  I am. This is a big deal. Very rare. Why don't you explain this to folks? So the Connecticut
[02:50:49.780 --> 02:50:53.980]  Supreme Court this morning, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court agreed to grant you info
[02:50:53.980 --> 02:50:58.140]  wars and Alex Jones and related entities the ability to take what's called a public interest
[02:50:58.140 --> 02:51:02.700]  appeal. Normally when you take an appeal, it's after the case is over. That's the so-called
[02:51:02.700 --> 02:51:07.700]  final judgment rule. There are special cases where intermediate or interlocutory appeals
[02:51:07.700 --> 02:51:12.180]  can be taken. Connecticut has a statute that says when an issue arises that's so important
[02:51:12.180 --> 02:51:15.900]  that it's in the public interest that it be heard immediately, the Supreme Court can bend
[02:51:15.900 --> 02:51:20.460]  the rules and let the appeal go up. So we took a public interest appeal of Judge Bellis's
[02:51:20.460 --> 02:51:26.220]  move benign your anti-flat motion in the face of the bogus claim that you had threatened
[02:51:26.220 --> 02:51:31.420]  to Chris Matty and lawyers for the other side. I was sitting right there on air with you.
[02:51:31.420 --> 02:51:36.740]  You did not. It was crystal clear and abundantly clear to me that this was not inciting violence
[02:51:36.740 --> 02:51:40.980]  or a true threat within the meaning of the law. Yet somehow, the lawyers through the
[02:51:40.980 --> 02:51:45.780]  Costco team and the Sandy Hook family managed to persuade the judge not only to impose
[02:51:45.780 --> 02:51:51.540]  sanctions, but to do so without any real meaningful opportunity for you to prepare or be heard.
[02:51:51.540 --> 02:51:57.220]  They filed a motion on a Monday for permission to do expedited briefing on sanctions by Tuesday
[02:51:57.220 --> 02:52:02.140]  afternoon. They were arguing in front of the judge for your entire lawsuit to be defaulted.
[02:52:02.140 --> 02:52:06.820]  The judge gave an intermediate sanction. Even though they knew you were in a three-year
[02:52:06.820 --> 02:52:12.380]  super famous case, which you just won in the same courthouse and couldn't be there.
[02:52:12.380 --> 02:52:16.700]  Well, that's funny because when the argument began, we thought it was going to be a scheduling
[02:52:16.700 --> 02:52:21.260]  debate. And so I was on the sixth floor of the building. You and another lawyer from
[02:52:21.260 --> 02:52:24.580]  my office were on the fifth. He came up at the lunch break. He said, you better get down
[02:52:24.580 --> 02:52:28.580]  there. I think the judge is going to throw the whole case. You've got to be out of your
[02:52:28.580 --> 02:52:33.060]  mind. She can't do that based on the law of the case. So I went down. We took a break
[02:52:33.060 --> 02:52:37.940]  from the other case I was in. And sure enough, she had her finger on the trigger. Now, we
[02:52:37.940 --> 02:52:43.700]  managed to persuade her from executing the entire case, but she still did you grieve
[02:52:43.700 --> 02:52:48.380]  this damage. So we took an appeal basically saying, A, you didn't threaten anybody, and
[02:52:48.380 --> 02:52:52.980]  B, because you didn't, the idea that you're being sanctioned for the exercise of your
[02:52:52.980 --> 02:52:57.860]  free speech is offensive to the First Amendment. What's more, in the context of this case,
[02:52:57.860 --> 02:53:01.020]  it's doubly offensive. You've been trying for the better part of a year to get your
[02:53:01.020 --> 02:53:06.900]  motion to dismiss her. The plaintiffs' lawyers have engaged in any amount of gamesmanship
[02:53:06.900 --> 02:53:10.940]  to try to avoid being heard on the merits, and they have succeeded. So we've asked the
[02:53:10.940 --> 02:53:16.540]  court to intervene. The Supreme Court set a briefing schedule. Our brief will be due
[02:53:16.540 --> 02:53:20.420]  in two weeks. The other side has to file theirs within a couple of weeks. We get a chance
[02:53:20.420 --> 02:53:25.300]  to reply. And the issues will be argued in front of the State Supreme Court sometime,
[02:53:25.300 --> 02:53:30.020]  I think in late September to early October of this year, with a decision shortly thereafter.
[02:53:30.020 --> 02:53:35.300]  We will ask the court to order the trial court to hear your motion to dismiss. The anti-flat
[02:53:35.300 --> 02:53:41.260]  suit was a vehicle that was intended to protect First Amendment values. In this case, the
[02:53:41.260 --> 02:53:45.980]  First Amendment's been made a mockery of. And much like the Acosta thing, politics
[02:53:45.980 --> 02:53:49.540]  are driving the interpretation of the law, and we're ending up in a strange new world
[02:53:49.540 --> 02:53:52.580]  that I don't want to live in, and I don't think you're doing it. So I'm pretty excited
[02:53:52.580 --> 02:53:53.580]  about the court.
[02:53:53.580 --> 02:53:56.660]  Well, he's spanning on that. I got called by one of my family lawyers whose name is
[02:53:56.660 --> 02:54:00.900]  on a lot of the state laws and things here. He just said, well, congratulations. He said,
[02:54:00.900 --> 02:54:05.260]  I looked it up. That's incredibly rare. And I said, what do you mean? He goes, well, normally
[02:54:05.260 --> 02:54:09.660]  these type of appeals before a case relieving starts are like when the judge or somebody
[02:54:09.660 --> 02:54:12.980]  else, we're not accusing the judge here of that. The judge literally gets caught being
[02:54:12.980 --> 02:54:17.100]  paid off in the parking lot, or if you know, videotaped or whatever. You know, they only
[02:54:17.100 --> 02:54:21.140]  come in with these public interest when it looks like a serious miscarriage. And that
[02:54:21.140 --> 02:54:25.740]  even the Connecticut News says this is incredibly rare. This has got to have the other side
[02:54:25.740 --> 02:54:29.100]  creating diamonds inside their, you know, what's.
[02:54:29.100 --> 02:54:33.580]  Well, they're probably creating diamonds way whoever's funding this extremely costly
[02:54:33.580 --> 02:54:36.900]  boondock, a little litigation, you know, that the most interesting thing in your viewers
[02:54:36.900 --> 02:54:41.340]  may not know is at least who aren't in Connecticut. Probably don't have the insight. But, you
[02:54:41.340 --> 02:54:45.620]  know, as I've come to represent you and been known around the state as you're aware of
[02:54:45.620 --> 02:54:48.860]  the Connecticut, a number of people are coming up to me saying, what's going on with these
[02:54:48.860 --> 02:54:52.660]  standard cases? And people are beginning to think, you know what, that was then this
[02:54:52.660 --> 02:54:57.380]  is now, yes, it was a horrible shooting in 2012. And there were certainly questions about
[02:54:57.380 --> 02:55:02.020]  what happened and you among others raised them. But that was then this is now in our
[02:55:02.020 --> 02:55:07.740]  pity for the families of Sandy Hook survivors, our victims, rather, we ought not to go so
[02:55:07.740 --> 02:55:11.900]  far as to make them censors. And that's what this litigation is becoming about. It's becoming
[02:55:11.900 --> 02:55:17.220]  about self-righteous censorship. And I'm hoping that we'll get a full hearing before the Connecticut
[02:55:17.220 --> 02:55:19.820]  Supreme Court on these issues. And I'm looking forward to you.
[02:55:19.820 --> 02:55:24.820]  That's right, Norm. And Norm, let's be clear. We're not tooting our horn. Oh, we're important.
[02:55:24.820 --> 02:55:29.740]  The Democrats, the Republicans, the courts admit this is the seminal. These cases are
[02:55:29.740 --> 02:55:34.220]  meant to end the First Amendment. And listen, I want to say nice things about Clarence Thomas.
[02:55:34.220 --> 02:55:38.420]  He wrote three months ago, a huge op-ed The New York Times saying it's time to end the
[02:55:38.420 --> 02:55:42.900]  First Amendment and get rid of press freedom because the Kavanaugh, no, it's terrible that
[02:55:42.900 --> 02:55:46.580]  they did to Kavanaugh. That's why we need good press to counter bad press. But they
[02:55:46.580 --> 02:55:50.540]  thought Republicans ready to get rid of free speech too. I found out big Republican money
[02:55:50.540 --> 02:55:56.300]  out of Texas connected to a former president or presidents are actually involved in this,
[02:55:56.300 --> 02:56:00.820]  my friend. Well, that's chilling to me. I mean, you know, I'm just immediately aware
[02:56:00.820 --> 02:56:05.060]  of you swimming waters that are too deep for me. But from where I sit, if I don't like
[02:56:05.060 --> 02:56:09.380]  what somebody's saying, I can turn my ears off so to speak and walk across the street.
[02:56:09.380 --> 02:56:13.060]  I don't want the government or somebody else telling me what I can and can't listen. We
[02:56:13.060 --> 02:56:18.220]  can also get right back in their face with the truth. Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean,
[02:56:18.220 --> 02:56:22.220]  the fact and the truth is with respect to Sandy Hook, this is long since in the rearview
[02:56:22.220 --> 02:56:26.460]  mirror for you that people keeping it alive are doing so. I think for political reasons,
[02:56:26.460 --> 02:56:30.500]  let me ask you this. Let me ask you this. Why do you think the court is this incredibly
[02:56:30.500 --> 02:56:37.340]  rare thing? Because I think you're right. I think we're right. You were at a minimum.
[02:56:37.340 --> 02:56:41.860]  You are in you are required to adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. And
[02:56:41.860 --> 02:56:47.620]  this kangaroo court style of justice was uncalled for and frankly unheard of. I'd never seen
[02:56:47.620 --> 02:56:53.060]  anything like it in Connecticut. Hopefully the court will reach the conclusion that your
[02:56:53.060 --> 02:56:58.420]  speech, although angry and a product of frustration was no true threat at all and that no sanctions
[02:56:58.420 --> 02:57:02.980]  are warranted. In an ideal world, the court will look at the record that we have assembled
[02:57:02.980 --> 02:57:06.900]  thus far and conclude that you're getting a railroad job, that you're being crucified
[02:57:06.900 --> 02:57:11.100]  politically and being denied a statutory remedy. That is the right to have your motion
[02:57:11.100 --> 02:57:16.540]  to dismiss for political reasons. Yes, what happened in Sandy Hook was tragic, but perhaps
[02:57:16.540 --> 02:57:20.260]  the courts are finally prepared to state that if it comes to the Sandy Hook shooting, cut
[02:57:20.260 --> 02:57:25.300]  your bed and walk. It's time to move on. That was seven years ago. That was then this is
[02:57:25.300 --> 02:57:29.340]  now there's a whole because as much as some people may hear Alex Jones, if I lose my due
[02:57:29.340 --> 02:57:34.940]  process, everybody else loses them. And you know, I've worried in Connecticut, you're
[02:57:34.940 --> 02:57:41.020]  an unpopular figure. Among some, we've got a lot more support for you. Hold on. Stay
[02:57:41.020 --> 02:57:46.580]  there. Back in two minutes. Storm Patis, fourth hour coming up. Let's talk to Marcus in New
[02:57:46.580 --> 02:57:50.100]  York. Marcus here on the air. Thanks for holding. Hey, Alex. Yeah, I just want to say your show
[02:57:50.100 --> 02:57:53.980]  is a breath of fresh air. I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City. And one
[02:57:53.980 --> 02:57:58.420]  thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars. I think that the Neocons
[02:57:58.420 --> 02:58:02.500]  are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the
[02:58:02.500 --> 02:58:06.700]  only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020. That's
[02:58:06.700 --> 02:58:10.420]  it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency. It's the only
[02:58:10.420 --> 02:58:13.820]  way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him. It's the time to be praying,
[02:58:13.820 --> 02:58:17.020]  my friend. I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know
[02:58:17.020 --> 02:58:21.620]  they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man. I would love to see you
[02:58:21.620 --> 02:58:25.020]  on air until you're 80 years old. I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're
[02:58:25.020 --> 02:58:30.860]  80. But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles.
[02:58:30.860 --> 02:58:34.700]  And there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[02:58:34.700 --> 02:58:38.260]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War. And even if something does happen to you or
[02:58:38.260 --> 02:58:43.140]  your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty. Thank
[02:58:43.140 --> 02:58:47.380]  you, sir, for calling.
[02:58:47.380 --> 02:58:54.540]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee. And luckily,
[02:58:54.540 --> 02:59:00.340]  our break room at the Info Wars headquarters is stocked full of high quality Info War store

[02:59:16.100 --> 02:59:22.220]  great flavor and mild acidity. There has never been a more important time to support Info

[02:59:48.940 --> 03:00:01.100]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:01.100 --> 03:00:08.500]  All right. One of Trump's top secretaries of labor. Alexander Acosta is with a press
[03:00:08.500 --> 03:00:12.420]  conference because the whole media is made about him and Jeffrey Epstein. I built Clinton
[03:00:12.420 --> 03:00:17.540]  on the airplane. Just don't know if it's him. So okay, whatever. I don't know if he's guilty
[03:00:17.540 --> 03:00:22.180]  or not, but this is supposedly already adjudicated. It's all the new stuff that Epstein should
[03:00:22.180 --> 03:00:26.020]  be in trouble for and built Clinton. Coming up next segment, I'll play some of the questions
[03:00:26.020 --> 03:00:29.820]  that are ongoing live and Mike Adams takes over. But one back to famous constitutional
[03:00:29.820 --> 03:00:36.980]  civil rights and criminal defense lawyer here at Norm Pattis of Connecticut, shifting years
[03:00:36.980 --> 03:00:42.580]  out of our case, my case. What do you make? Because I called you this morning or you called
[03:00:42.580 --> 03:00:46.100]  me this morning and then I called you back and I said, Oh, by the way, have you seen
[03:00:46.100 --> 03:00:50.340]  where Facebook issues new policy saying is acceptable to post death threats? And then
[03:00:50.340 --> 03:00:54.700]  they say, well, if someone's been named as bad, you can organize their murder. Facebook
[03:00:54.700 --> 03:00:59.220]  then reversed it. It's on infowarstore.com with no comment. That's in their main terms
[03:00:59.220 --> 03:01:04.940]  of service. What do you think that means? It's absolutely chilling. First, we've got
[03:01:04.940 --> 03:01:10.140]  a giant secret algorithm determining what we can and can't listen to or hear or see.
[03:01:10.140 --> 03:01:14.340]  Now we've got a giant algorithm determining who or what we can and should be encouraged
[03:01:14.340 --> 03:01:21.300]  to destroy. Facebook is behaving as the big other. And the notion that it can direct hatred
[03:01:21.300 --> 03:01:26.580]  toward others in the name of eliminating hatred is unconscionable. It should be a neutral
[03:01:26.580 --> 03:01:31.140]  communications platform. It's not, we need to challenge it with litigation. We need to
[03:01:31.140 --> 03:01:35.380]  challenge it with legislation. Facebook is not in control of the country or maybe it
[03:01:35.380 --> 03:01:39.940]  is, but I always thought we, the people were the people who did the constitution, not Facebook.
[03:01:39.940 --> 03:01:43.660]  Well, that was beautifully said because I've been struggling since I've learned about this
[03:01:43.660 --> 03:01:50.180]  yesterday with Paul to try like, is it a fatwa? They're organizing people to kill us. They're
[03:01:50.180 --> 03:01:54.860]  demonizing us saying they're convicting me outside of court and saying I deserve to die.
[03:01:54.860 --> 03:02:01.620]  I mean, this is so crazy. There is no mob as dangerous as a self-righteous mob. And when
[03:02:01.620 --> 03:02:06.080]  we give people the power to control speech, at least when it's governed by the First
[03:02:06.080 --> 03:02:11.580]  Amendment, it's supposed to be content neutral to protect minorities, to protect people with
[03:02:11.580 --> 03:02:16.500]  unpopular views, to protect people outside the mainstream. Facebook as a private company
[03:02:16.500 --> 03:02:20.740]  lives a privileged, privileged life. It can't be sued for the content it hosts under the
[03:02:20.740 --> 03:02:25.740]  communications decency act, but now apparently the communications it hosts are somewhat criminal
[03:02:25.740 --> 03:02:30.060]  in content. And I think Facebook needs to lose its immunity.
[03:02:30.060 --> 03:02:33.860]  I totally agree because, because I'm not a lawyer, but here it is, section two, third
[03:02:33.860 --> 03:02:37.900]  of the again immunity, they're now making judgments saying you can only talk about all
[03:02:37.900 --> 03:02:41.860]  shows of this negative and you can say killing. They're now direct. They're not just being
[03:02:41.860 --> 03:02:46.340]  neutral. They're being positive. They're being, they're directing.
[03:02:46.340 --> 03:02:50.180]  It's an outrage. And you know, I've not, you know, I've been away from out of the office
[03:02:50.180 --> 03:02:53.820]  trying to avoid the law for a few weeks. You know, you're hearing about this from here.
[03:02:53.820 --> 03:02:57.860]  This morning was the first I heard about it. I need to look into it. If you're right and
[03:02:57.860 --> 03:03:02.140]  they made affirmative statements encouraging or enticing others to cause you harm, they
[03:03:02.140 --> 03:03:06.460]  should be prosecuted criminal. Period. That's what the criminal law is for. We are free to
[03:03:06.460 --> 03:03:10.700]  speak freely about one another and to test one another for our ideas and the positions
[03:03:10.700 --> 03:03:16.180]  we take. We are not free to solicit the murder of others. We are not free to solicit gratuitous
[03:03:16.180 --> 03:03:21.020]  and random acts of violence based on politics. To declare that a hated source of speech can
[03:03:21.020 --> 03:03:26.140]  be hated to the point of physical violence is to make a mockery of the rule of law. Facebook
[03:03:26.140 --> 03:03:29.900]  is behaving like a behemoth that needs to be destroyed.
[03:03:29.900 --> 03:03:35.940]  Absolutely. If I was Facebook, I'd say destroy me. That's the key point. They're always saying
[03:03:35.940 --> 03:03:39.940]  we want violence. We want to end speech. We're oppressing people. I'm a classical liberal
[03:03:39.940 --> 03:03:44.620]  like you are. And then they're the ones doing everything they say we're doing.
[03:03:44.620 --> 03:03:48.860]  There's a lot of normalization of craziness going on. I'm watching the Democratic candidates
[03:03:48.860 --> 03:03:53.060]  and they're all deciding which, you know, they're all trying to normalize us to reparations.
[03:03:53.060 --> 03:03:57.620]  You know, Camilla Harris is saying we need to give housing allowances to people of color.
[03:03:57.620 --> 03:04:01.140]  You know, I mean, what's that all about? I'm not going to pay a race based tax. I'm not
[03:04:01.140 --> 03:04:05.740]  going to be penalized for my speech. The government is supposed to be a neutral regulator
[03:04:05.740 --> 03:04:10.900]  of competing values and competing interests. When it embraces one to the exclusion of the
[03:04:10.900 --> 03:04:14.740]  rights of other, it becomes tyrannical. And that's where lawyers play a role of going
[03:04:14.740 --> 03:04:19.060]  into courts and fighting for justice. Whether you get justice or not, that's an open question.
[03:04:19.060 --> 03:04:22.860]  You know, Clarence DeRoe once said there is no justice in or out of court. I think he's
[03:04:22.860 --> 03:04:26.460]  right. I think the fight is all there is. And the fight, unfortunately, is all we have
[03:04:26.460 --> 03:04:30.220]  left. That's why I'm so proud to represent you. I mean, you're going to do every day
[03:04:30.220 --> 03:04:35.020]  pitching your fight. Your viewers are supporting you. I'm privileged enough to represent you
[03:04:35.020 --> 03:04:39.460]  and I'll defend your right to speak and your listeners' rights to hear you. But, you know,
[03:04:39.460 --> 03:04:43.660]  these are real fights and they go on every day. And when you see this crap with Facebook,
[03:04:43.660 --> 03:04:46.460]  it makes you realize they may have potential life and death consequences.
[03:04:46.460 --> 03:04:49.500]  That's right. It just shows you things are out of control. Norm Pattis, thank you so
[03:04:49.500 --> 03:04:54.820]  much. God bless. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[03:04:54.820 --> 03:04:58.540]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[03:04:58.540 --> 03:05:03.260]  The other thing that's unique about Info Wars is it is the only network of this reach that
[03:05:03.260 --> 03:05:08.260]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy. That's not backed by some billionaire.
[03:05:08.260 --> 03:05:11.820]  That's not being funded by a secret foreign government. It is completely independent of
[03:05:11.820 --> 03:05:17.060]  all that. It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the
[03:05:17.060 --> 03:05:21.300]  freedom of press and freedom of speech. That, in fact, the founders were so concerned with
[03:05:21.300 --> 03:05:25.420]  at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations
[03:05:25.420 --> 03:05:28.860]  just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted. And then ultimately we
[03:05:28.860 --> 03:05:32.900]  now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire
[03:05:32.900 --> 03:05:37.420]  sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the persons
[03:05:37.420 --> 03:05:42.340]  allowed to have or express or hear. And the Info Wars audience has broken through that.
[03:05:42.340 --> 03:05:46.900]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and
[03:05:46.900 --> 03:05:51.540]  freedom. And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the black warming defamation,
[03:05:51.540 --> 03:06:03.820]  welfare and libel targeting youth.
[03:06:03.820 --> 03:06:12.340]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:06:12.340 --> 03:06:18.380]  U.S. News and World Report. Court to review sanctions against Info Wars host Alex Jones.
[03:06:18.380 --> 03:06:22.620]  An etiquette Supreme Court has agreed to consider whether a judge properly sanctioned conspiracy
[03:06:22.620 --> 03:06:27.540]  theorist Alex Jones for a mercy made by a lawyer. But I didn't make it about the lawyer.
[03:06:27.540 --> 03:06:32.660]  For the families of the children who killed 2012, Sandy Hook School shooting, Associated
[03:06:32.660 --> 03:06:40.460]  Press. Well, they don't like that. Super rare to have an appeal before a case starts.
[03:06:40.460 --> 03:06:45.740]  They are really panicking because that judge went way too far. I just learned that someone
[03:06:45.740 --> 03:06:52.300]  had planted child porn in our emails, hidden codes, and then they'd subpoenaed them and
[03:06:52.300 --> 03:06:56.580]  they were going to put it in the news. And I blew up at them and said, not the lawyers,
[03:06:56.580 --> 03:07:00.060]  but I said, whoever did this is a reward. I'm going to get your ass, put your head on
[03:07:00.060 --> 03:07:07.420]  a pipe. And then they turned it into that I was threatening the lawyers. What? Incredible
[03:07:07.420 --> 03:07:14.020]  man. Incredible. Mike Adams is taking over very, very soon.
[03:07:14.020 --> 03:07:18.100]  Robert Robinson's probably already gone to bed by now. He's got three young children
[03:07:18.100 --> 03:07:23.820]  and great wife. I know him behind the scenes and he's facing two or three years in solitary
[03:07:23.820 --> 03:07:28.420]  confinement. No judge in America would ever do this. No jury would do this, but they've
[03:07:28.420 --> 03:07:33.140]  gotten rid of juries for people like Tommy outside of law without a jury trial. He's
[03:07:33.140 --> 03:07:37.860]  facing prison. That's just insane. But I think Matt Drudge, the public and everybody that
[03:07:37.860 --> 03:07:43.820]  spread those articles and hopefully the president will consider some type of diplomatic solution
[03:07:43.820 --> 03:07:47.740]  because we bring people here from Cuba or North Korea or China who are being persecuted
[03:07:47.740 --> 03:07:52.660]  for their speech journalist. That's a real asylum seeker. Not people here with an anchor
[03:07:52.660 --> 03:08:02.060]  baby or whatever. This is a hero that exposed giant child kidnapping rings that are all
[03:08:02.060 --> 03:08:07.980]  confirmed to hundreds of trials, thousands, thousands of convictions. He did it. He was
[03:08:07.980 --> 03:08:15.460]  domino number one instead of being carried on the people's shoulders. I talked to Tommy
[03:08:15.460 --> 03:08:20.540]  before I went on Tucker Carlson. He'd been out of jail two days. He'd lost almost 40
[03:08:20.540 --> 03:08:26.140]  pounds. He's not a big guy. He'd been in jail a year before for trying to take kids away
[03:08:26.140 --> 03:08:29.580]  from child kidnappers. He just saw it going on. Little kids crying for mommy. Muzzles put
[03:08:29.580 --> 03:08:32.900]  them in cars. He beat their ass. You've seen all the footage of him fighting people. This
[03:08:32.900 --> 03:08:38.740]  is going on everywhere. And he was completely out of it when I talked to him. Imagine the
[03:08:38.740 --> 03:08:42.900]  US troops that have been like North Korea and North Vietnam for five years and saw
[03:08:42.900 --> 03:08:45.460]  American family. They're like, I don't know who they are. Well, he'd been there three
[03:08:45.460 --> 03:08:51.740]  months, lost almost 40 pounds, no food. The muscles put their butts up to the opening.
[03:08:51.740 --> 03:08:56.540]  Just all day just pooping on him. The guards laughing, the liberal guards. He was just out
[03:08:56.540 --> 03:09:00.740]  of, he was just like, Oh, I don't know. Come on, Alex. He went on Tucker. Remember, he
[03:09:00.740 --> 03:09:05.140]  was like all spaced out on Tucker. He's a smart, well-spoken guy, but that's what that
[03:09:05.140 --> 03:09:13.420]  does to your spirit. Being a Muslim toilet in the UK, it was all a ritual to take a
[03:09:13.420 --> 03:09:18.500]  patriot like him and turn him into a toilet, try to break his spirit. And now they want
[03:09:18.500 --> 03:09:22.700]  to shove him right back in the oven again. It pisses me off. I physically feel it like
[03:09:22.700 --> 03:09:29.380]  I'm being attacked because I am. They want to do that to me. I want to do that to you.
[03:09:29.380 --> 03:09:33.700]  I'm going to tell them some right now. Just like Facebook went so far as to say, we're
[03:09:33.700 --> 03:09:39.260]  going to tell people to kill conservatives. They said, you're allowed to kill conservatives.
[03:09:39.260 --> 03:09:43.700]  And they had to pull it because we exposed it, but they're testing their probing. Here's
[03:09:43.700 --> 03:09:48.900]  some of Alexander Acosta's ongoing press conference. Let's see what's happening.
[03:09:48.900 --> 03:09:57.500]  Yes, Ben Penn from Bloomberg Law. You know, in light of the attention this week on your
[03:09:57.500 --> 03:10:03.260]  handling of, back in 2008, victims of sex trafficking, I wanted to ask about your role
[03:10:03.260 --> 03:10:08.780]  today as a secretary of labor. You have oversight through the wage and hour division of certifying
[03:10:08.780 --> 03:10:14.620]  visas for victims of human trafficking, including sex trafficking. And just last week, your
[03:10:14.620 --> 03:10:20.460]  wage and hour division issued a new policy that would essentially allow the agency, it's
[03:10:20.460 --> 03:10:23.740]  being criticized by a lot of people I talk to for allowing the agency to completely remove
[03:10:23.740 --> 03:10:29.140]  itself or to virtually remove itself from continuing to certify these visas by referring
[03:10:29.140 --> 03:10:34.180]  them to other agencies. How can you defend what is the purpose of that?
[03:10:34.180 --> 03:10:40.940]  This is exactly where I thought it was going. We're being hit with a six-fold increase in
[03:10:40.940 --> 03:10:44.820]  illegal aliens coming across. One-third of the children aren't with their family. That's
[03:10:44.820 --> 03:10:51.620]  genetically testing. We're collapsing. And then they're like, oh, you're not giving enough
[03:10:51.620 --> 03:10:58.100]  services and certification to sex slaves when it's the border patrol that's doing it and
[03:10:58.100 --> 03:11:02.460]  trying to find out who's who. And the media says, don't stop them. Don't check them. Don't
[03:11:02.460 --> 03:11:07.740]  question. And the Senate report admits that Trump's policy is saving all these people.
[03:11:07.740 --> 03:11:11.660]  And it was Obama saying, let them through, even though they were being given to sex
[03:11:11.660 --> 03:11:18.220]  traffickers. I mean, the first question is, oh, you're connected to Epstein. You only
[03:11:18.220 --> 03:11:23.260]  send them to jail for a year. So you're involved in what we're doing as Democrats. I mean, these
[03:11:23.260 --> 03:11:29.220]  people are sick. And Google and Facebook are busy protecting the Clintons, protecting
[03:11:29.220 --> 03:11:34.660]  Democrats and expunging their names out of Google, Facebook, Twitter. And then the Secretary
[03:11:34.660 --> 03:11:39.980]  of Labor, I don't know if he's guilty or innocent, but they're just immediately saying he is
[03:11:39.980 --> 03:11:44.580]  going to hurt children that are being brought in here illegally. Let's go back to it.
[03:11:44.580 --> 03:11:52.060]  The policy that is not what it does are wage an hour administrator after she was confirmed
[03:11:52.060 --> 03:11:59.140]  came in and she reviewed the policies. And she put in place a requirement that a criminal
[03:11:59.140 --> 03:12:07.100]  prosecutor be consulted any time one of these issues is brought to the division's attention.
[03:12:07.100 --> 03:12:11.420]  And that seems very reasonable. Don't we want criminal prosecutors to be consulted?
[03:12:11.420 --> 03:12:15.380]  Hit pause and back yourself. Oh, I forgot this part too. Yep. Yep. Trump changed the
[03:12:15.380 --> 03:12:24.420]  policy where criminal prosecutors had to look at people caught smuggling kids. Criminal prosecutors
[03:12:24.420 --> 03:12:36.100]  look at people caught with kids that aren't theirs coming across the border. Again, if
[03:12:36.100 --> 03:12:42.820]  Trump was involved in trafficking kids, I would wage war on him. He's not. It's the Clintons.
[03:12:42.820 --> 03:12:51.500]  It's Obama. It's all their people. And we know that. And then Trump sits there and lets
[03:12:51.500 --> 03:12:58.500]  all the censorship go on and Facebook come out and say it's going to start letting users
[03:12:58.500 --> 03:13:06.860]  create groups to kill me and kill you. Let's see. See, Trump's 73. He's from when the country
[03:13:06.860 --> 03:13:10.220]  was free. They just don't even know what's going on. I know folks that are having dinner
[03:13:10.220 --> 03:13:14.060]  with Brad Parskels three times. People that have a dinner with Trump and Trump literally
[03:13:14.060 --> 03:13:18.780]  asked, well, how do they shadow ban? How's that work? I've talked to 10 people in the
[03:13:18.780 --> 03:13:22.620]  last week that have had dinner or meetings with Trump and they say, no, he seems real
[03:13:22.620 --> 03:13:27.620]  nice. But he's like, he'll like, yeah, they're lying about me on North Korea. I want peace
[03:13:27.620 --> 03:13:34.100]  or boy, he just, he means well, but man, he has no idea how much evil he's up against.
[03:13:34.100 --> 03:13:41.380]  He just has no idea. And I get it. I can't believe how evil it is. I don't even know
[03:13:41.380 --> 03:13:46.860]  how you do it. So do you hear this? Bloomberg here. You've got federal prosecutors talking
[03:13:46.860 --> 03:13:51.300]  to people caught smuggling kids across. What do you say for yourself, Acosta? Let's go
[03:13:51.300 --> 03:13:52.300]  back to it.
[03:13:52.300 --> 03:13:59.180]  To the division's attention. And that seems very reasonable. Don't we want criminal prosecutors
[03:13:59.180 --> 03:14:03.740]  to be consulted whenever someone says that they are a victim of trafficking? No, that's
[03:14:03.740 --> 03:14:09.500]  that's that's evil. And that prosecutor will be consulted. And even if that prosecutor
[03:14:09.500 --> 03:14:15.980]  says this is not a case that we are going forward with, I'm sorry, pause. There's sometimes
[03:14:15.980 --> 03:14:18.740]  one question that's arose out of stone. This is the first question that was asked like
[03:14:18.740 --> 03:14:24.500]  20 minutes ago. We paused it. How dare you get your agency out of the involvement because
[03:14:24.500 --> 03:14:28.980]  Obama had it where there was no law enforcement involved and they just let everybody in.
[03:14:28.980 --> 03:14:32.860]  And now you have people being arrested. How dare you hurt the children by arresting the
[03:14:32.860 --> 03:14:33.860]  pedophiles?
[03:14:33.860 --> 03:14:41.060]  I mean, you can't. It's what I'm saying. It's insane. It's insane. They're in concentration
[03:14:41.060 --> 03:14:44.780]  camps. They're in cages. What they're trying to get in here by the hundreds of thousands.
[03:14:44.780 --> 03:14:50.740]  We have no God knows who they are. Masses of them are kidnapped children. Trump tries
[03:14:50.740 --> 03:14:58.940]  to find out who they are. And now this guy, he's the bad man. Here, let's continue.
[03:14:58.940 --> 03:15:05.060]  He's on the facts. So that is a mischaracterization of her decision and her policy.
[03:15:05.060 --> 03:15:06.060]  Yes.
[03:15:06.060 --> 03:15:13.420]  Could you go into a bit more detail about where and how you exactly negotiated this deal?
[03:15:13.420 --> 03:15:17.460]  Did you meet with Epstein's attorney alone at a Marriott Hotel?
[03:15:17.460 --> 03:15:21.420]  So you know, I've read this, let's get pause again. We're going to come back with this.
[03:15:21.420 --> 03:15:26.500]  Back it up. So remember, Bill Clinton's on the plane now. It's like 100 times and there's
[03:15:26.500 --> 03:15:29.820]  little kids on there. This guy has nothing to do with it. The Democrats are going to
[03:15:29.820 --> 03:15:34.380]  let him off to get some prosecution. I'm not even defending it. The guy deserved death penalty.
[03:15:34.380 --> 03:15:39.780]  And now it's another reporter. Tell us about how you protected him for Trump 10 years ago
[03:15:39.780 --> 03:15:47.700]  or 12 years ago. Again, all the media protecting the pedophiles, Google blocking it, Wikipedia
[03:15:47.700 --> 03:15:53.420]  blocking it. What a sick group of scum.
[03:15:53.420 --> 03:15:57.420]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize

[03:17:51.900 --> 03:17:56.980]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[03:17:56.980 --> 03:18:00.300]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, I just want to say, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[03:18:00.300 --> 03:18:03.940]  I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is
[03:18:03.940 --> 03:18:06.460]  that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[03:18:06.460 --> 03:18:10.860]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[03:18:10.860 --> 03:18:15.100]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching
[03:18:15.100 --> 03:18:16.100]  2020.
[03:18:16.100 --> 03:18:18.940]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[03:18:18.940 --> 03:18:21.980]  It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him.
[03:18:21.980 --> 03:18:23.300]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[03:18:23.300 --> 03:18:26.500]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying
[03:18:26.500 --> 03:18:31.180]  to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man. I would love to see you on air
[03:18:31.180 --> 03:18:34.220]  until you're 80 years old. I would love to see what you're talking about when you're
[03:18:34.220 --> 03:18:39.940]  80. But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles.
[03:18:39.940 --> 03:18:43.780]  And there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[03:18:43.780 --> 03:18:47.020]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war. And even if something does happen to
[03:18:47.020 --> 03:18:52.220]  you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[03:18:52.220 --> 03:19:01.540]  Thank you, sir, for calling 1776 worldwide. That's a term I coined 15 years ago. What
[03:19:01.540 --> 03:19:07.180]  does it really mean? It means the idea of American freedom renaissance worldwide doesn't
[03:19:07.180 --> 03:19:13.180]  mean we go conquer countries. It means our superior Western values of true freedom get
[03:19:13.180 --> 03:19:19.620]  adopted because compared to globalism, it's night and day. We're going to do a 34 hour
[03:19:19.620 --> 03:19:25.660]  special broadcast. The kicks off this Thursday morning at 8am with David Knight runs right
[03:19:25.660 --> 03:19:31.100]  through with me and many others till the next day at 6pm on the war room. We're going to
[03:19:31.100 --> 03:19:36.380]  have our crew in DC at the White House summit on social media. We're going to be at the
[03:19:36.380 --> 03:19:41.220]  after party with all the key folks taking action against censorship and so much more.
[03:19:41.220 --> 03:19:46.500]  So everybody, share that link in full wars.com forward slash show kicking off this Thursday
[03:19:46.500 --> 03:19:59.060]  at 8am central at info wars.com forward slash show 1776 worldwide. You're listening to the
[03:19:59.060 --> 03:20:28.220]  Alex Jones show. So I've been reading about Alexander Acosta for I don't four or five
[03:20:28.220 --> 03:20:34.260]  years that Trump ran because Trump had involved the campaign and then he put him in his head
[03:20:34.260 --> 03:20:39.900]  of the department of labor and I'm neutral. So I'm just watching. I'm looking and it's
[03:20:39.900 --> 03:20:45.060]  like out there, the board of patrol and justice department of prosecutors under your recommendation
[03:20:45.060 --> 03:20:51.340]  stopping child trafficking you pedophile. I mean, this is this is crazy to him and the
[03:20:51.340 --> 03:20:54.180]  next person jumps up. So let's play a few more of these questions and we'll go to Mike
[03:20:54.180 --> 03:21:11.420]  Adams. Here it is. So, you know, I've read this and one of the things I find interesting
[03:21:11.420 --> 03:21:21.700]  is how how facts become facts because they're in a newspaper, as opposed to the record.
[03:21:21.700 --> 03:21:26.980]  I pulled up I I found out the details of that meeting because I scratched my own head about
[03:21:26.980 --> 03:21:32.700]  it and I've provided you a timeline in a letter of the negotiations that make it very clear
[03:21:32.700 --> 03:21:38.220]  that this was negotiated by career prosecutors. The I'm going to answer your question. The
[03:21:38.220 --> 03:21:45.340]  meeting that was alleged was a breakfast meeting that took place after the agreement was negotiated
[03:21:45.340 --> 03:21:51.420]  not before the agreement was signed in September. After the agreement was negotiated, one of
[03:21:51.420 --> 03:21:57.260]  Epstein's attorneys asked for a meeting asked for a hearing. I was giving a speech. I was
[03:21:57.260 --> 03:22:03.100]  staying at a hotel. I agreed to have a brief meeting, I believe at 7am rather than open
[03:22:03.100 --> 03:22:08.420]  the office. I spoke with that attorney and then I referred that attorney to the career
[03:22:08.420 --> 03:22:13.940]  prosecutors. Nothing changed in that agreement. They continue to litigate the matter. They
[03:22:13.940 --> 03:22:19.580]  continue to appeal the matter to Washington and nothing changed with one one exception.
[03:22:19.580 --> 03:22:27.340]  There was an addendum that made clear that Epstein had to pay for any attorney that a
[03:22:27.340 --> 03:22:33.900]  victim that represented a victim in the case.
[03:22:33.900 --> 03:22:38.780]  You're seeing the mastery here of the corporate whores, though, where they turn Epstein and
[03:22:38.780 --> 03:22:44.660]  the Clintons and all this around onto somebody else. Whereas let's say this guy's a horrible
[03:22:44.660 --> 03:22:49.140]  demon that helped cover it up and barely got in the prison sentence. Why is it him? Why
[03:22:49.140 --> 03:22:53.500]  is a little self-righteous woman? She's shaking her big five foot long hair and all. I'm on
[03:22:53.500 --> 03:22:59.980]  TV, I'm beautiful. And then she's sitting there defending the Clintons, defending all
[03:22:59.980 --> 03:23:06.740]  of it. It's just sick. It's sick. Let's continue.
[03:23:06.740 --> 03:23:13.180]  Against Epstein. And so, yes, I met with opposing counsel. It was a breakfast meeting because
[03:23:13.180 --> 03:23:15.460]  I was staying at the hotel after.
[03:23:15.460 --> 03:23:21.380]  Did you hear this? The government met with the defenseless lawyers. I've never heard
[03:23:21.380 --> 03:23:27.580]  of this before. That's like a piece of beef being between two hamburger buns or a hot
[03:23:27.580 --> 03:23:32.500]  dog. I mean, they just, again, it's the way they operate. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands
[03:23:32.500 --> 03:23:36.020]  of kids are getting taken across a year. A bunch of them are coming up missing. Trump's
[03:23:36.020 --> 03:23:40.980]  got 10 full bust of pedophiles going on and the media is going to successfully turn this
[03:23:40.980 --> 03:23:45.360]  into Trump's the pedophile. They've already done it. There's no connection to Epstein.
[03:23:45.360 --> 03:23:50.100]  It's all the Democrats, but everyone grovels to them and goes, Oh, we have a press conference.
[03:23:50.100 --> 03:23:54.220]  Oh, I did something wrong. I'm so sorry. Just never ending.
[03:23:54.220 --> 03:23:58.980]  Here, let's go back to it.
[03:23:58.980 --> 03:24:05.700]  Not part of the negotiations, but it was after the agreement had been negotiated. And that
[03:24:05.700 --> 03:24:09.620]  could be confirmed simply by looking at the date on the agreement and the date on the
[03:24:09.620 --> 03:24:17.740]  meeting. So number one, the agreement had already been locked in place so the
[03:24:17.740 --> 03:24:22.100]  agreement wasn't going to change. Before that agreement, you know, I was very
[03:24:22.100 --> 03:24:26.700]  careful to not negotiate this. Our career attorneys negotiated the agreement.
[03:24:26.700 --> 03:24:30.380]  Secondly, I'd point out, we live in a city where people have breakfast meetings
[03:24:30.380 --> 03:24:35.740]  all the time. You don't open an office at 7 o'clock in the morning just to have
[03:24:35.740 --> 03:24:40.940]  a meeting. You have it over breakfast. Pause on that. I don't just agree with
[03:24:40.940 --> 03:24:44.420]  this guy, but when I'm out on the road, people don't know where I'm at. I mean, I'll
[03:24:44.420 --> 03:24:48.420]  have like 10, 5 minute, 10 minute meetings while I'm at breakfast. And people just
[03:24:48.420 --> 03:24:51.540]  come up to the table. I'll be at Trump Tower or whatever, eating breakfast, like
[03:24:51.540 --> 03:24:55.180]  meeting, meeting, meeting, meeting. The idea that you have a meeting with
[03:24:55.180 --> 03:24:59.340]  somebody now makes you a criminal. Let's continue.
[03:24:59.340 --> 03:25:06.980]  Let me, let me, let me do this. I had, I had called you and I'll come back to, I'll
[03:25:06.980 --> 03:25:10.860]  come back to you. Don't the young girls. I wanted to give you an offer. Don't the young girls that they'll
[03:25:10.860 --> 03:25:16.380]  quit and rape, don't they? You raised them. You did not build. He's good. You have several times that you and the
[03:25:16.380 --> 03:25:21.820]  prosecutors in your office weren't sure that you could secure a win. Here, back to
[03:25:21.820 --> 03:25:26.260]  something. I love how these Democrats won't do a damn thing about child
[03:25:26.260 --> 03:25:30.260]  trafficking. All these newspapers say I'm a conspiracy theorist because I say the
[03:25:30.260 --> 03:25:34.860]  deep state is using kidnapped children to compromise people, not just young women.
[03:25:34.860 --> 03:25:38.380]  I mean, they're, they are raping little kids. They're killing them, snuff films.
[03:25:38.380 --> 03:25:42.220]  It's all come out in the nexium trial. And boy, these holy and righteous
[03:25:42.220 --> 03:25:47.020]  Democrat though, they go, they're like, yeah, these young girls deserve it. I mean,
[03:25:47.020 --> 03:25:53.700]  it is ridiculous. The holier than now crap from these people. You covered up the
[03:25:53.700 --> 03:25:57.880]  WMDs. You covered up the open borders. You covered up the child smuggling. You
[03:25:57.880 --> 03:26:01.540]  covered up the opium epidemic. You covered up the ethanol scams. Trump's
[03:26:01.540 --> 03:26:06.140]  trying to fight all that. People tell me they go, Alex, you're so corrupt and evil.
[03:26:06.140 --> 03:26:09.980]  I, I have to go to the New York Times to make up lies about you because I have to
[03:26:09.980 --> 03:26:14.540]  atone for how we help get Trump elected. I've had a former employee employee
[03:26:14.540 --> 03:26:19.020]  tell me this. They have to, I have to make up lies because you're bad. You got
[03:26:19.020 --> 03:26:22.860]  Trump, except these women that say Kavanaugh rapes and they go, well, I made
[03:26:22.860 --> 03:26:29.380]  it up, but he's bad. I mean, he, he's Kavanaugh. He, he deserves to be told that
[03:26:29.380 --> 03:26:36.700]  he raped me. It's not true, but I'm a good person because Kavanaugh raped me. I
[03:26:36.700 --> 03:26:40.140]  taught people, I go, you know, I'd ever did that. They go, but it doesn't matter.
[03:26:40.140 --> 03:26:44.740]  Trump's bad. I go, you're, you're in a cult. They go, I'm gonna get you. The New
[03:26:44.740 --> 03:26:49.260]  York Times told me I was a good person. I mean, they want to be, it's demonic. They
[03:26:49.260 --> 03:26:56.580]  want to be padded by the New York Times goes, huh, you're a good person. Mike Adams
[03:26:56.580 --> 03:27:02.020]  has taken over. Will Johnson's hosting to come into town, do a great job. While
[03:27:02.020 --> 03:27:08.060]  Owen Shroyer is up at the Trump event covering all that in DC. And I'm sure
[03:27:08.060 --> 03:27:11.500]  they'll play more of this because this is unbelievable. I mean, this is just like
[03:27:11.500 --> 03:27:16.620]  how dare you have prosecutors investigate pedophiles. How dare you stop kids being
[03:27:16.620 --> 03:27:20.700]  spelled across the border? You know, how dare you, how dare you, but we have a 34

[03:31:53.820 --> 03:31:59.940]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world. So the Infowars model is a
[03:31:59.940 --> 03:32:04.180]  self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and
[03:32:04.180 --> 03:32:07.500]  free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and
[03:32:07.500 --> 03:32:12.020]  sustaining one another. It is the only independent press of this size and scale
[03:32:12.020 --> 03:32:16.340]  of this public reach. It is the one model that says here's a way to have a
[03:32:16.340 --> 03:32:20.340]  self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little de-democratic
[03:32:20.340 --> 03:32:23.940]  structure that because the audience determines what content goes up, the
[03:32:23.940 --> 03:32:27.460]  audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and
[03:32:27.460 --> 03:32:30.940]  supporting Infowars. And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is,
[03:32:30.940 --> 03:32:34.820]  whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they
[03:32:34.820 --> 03:32:38.300]  want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model and the ability
[03:32:38.300 --> 03:32:42.620]  to do that. And at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the
[03:32:42.620 --> 03:32:46.300]  audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold. And
[03:32:46.300 --> 03:32:50.220]  it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the
[03:32:50.220 --> 03:32:54.820]  celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[03:32:54.820 --> 03:33:12.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. We now take you live to the Central
[03:33:12.740 --> 03:33:19.540]  Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance. It's Mike Adams. You're
[03:33:19.540 --> 03:33:25.300]  listening to the Alex Jones show. All right, we've got some hard-hitting stories
[03:33:25.300 --> 03:33:28.540]  coming up here. Thanks for joining me. Mike Adams from Natural News filling in
[03:33:28.540 --> 03:33:33.020]  for the last segment, last couple of segments here on the Infowars Alex Jones
[03:33:33.020 --> 03:33:38.740]  show. Just a quick notice, gonna bring you a story about California's nuclear
[03:33:38.740 --> 03:33:44.420]  power plants being built on or near the San Andreas fault line with an analysis
[03:33:44.420 --> 03:33:50.020]  of why that could unleash a Fukushima-style catastrophe that could
[03:33:50.020 --> 03:33:54.420]  render Southern California uninhabitable for 300 years, at least
[03:33:54.420 --> 03:34:00.220]  uninhabitable by humans. So that's coming up. Also Google exposing itself as
[03:34:00.220 --> 03:34:06.580]  pro-pedophilia, pro-child abuse by opposing sex trafficking laws that would
[03:34:06.580 --> 03:34:11.900]  protect children. I'll give you a quick analysis of that situation as well. But
[03:34:11.900 --> 03:34:18.580]  you see, we are seeing the tech giants now collapse into terrorism, racketeering,
[03:34:18.580 --> 03:34:24.980]  child trafficking, cover-ups, every insane thing that you can imagine. And
[03:34:24.980 --> 03:34:30.380]  commenting on what you heard earlier in today's show with Facebook essentially
[03:34:30.380 --> 03:34:35.980]  endorsing calls for extreme violence and murder against Paul Joseph Watson and
[03:34:35.980 --> 03:34:41.980]  Alex Jones and Laura Loomer and others. We have now seen Facebook become an
[03:34:41.980 --> 03:34:46.580]  admitted terrorist organization. This is happening at the same time that
[03:34:46.580 --> 03:34:50.820]  Twitter is protecting Antifa, a domestic terrorism group that uses violence to
[03:34:50.820 --> 03:34:55.500]  achieve its desired outcomes. Google is protecting Antifa, another radical
[03:34:55.500 --> 03:34:59.980]  left-wing terrorist, and now Google is protecting child sex trafficking. While
[03:34:59.980 --> 03:35:05.700]  Democrat operatives are being arrested and indicted for child trafficking, child
[03:35:05.700 --> 03:35:12.300]  prostitution, and what do you say, grooming these young children, extreme
[03:35:12.300 --> 03:35:16.940]  pedophilia, not even to mention the cultural assault on our children with
[03:35:16.940 --> 03:35:23.020]  the transgender indoctrination. And all that the mainstream media can do is say
[03:35:23.020 --> 03:35:29.340]  Trump is bad, orange man bad, that's it. The media refuses to cover any of these
[03:35:29.340 --> 03:35:33.900]  critical stories about what's really happening in our world. They absolutely
[03:35:33.900 --> 03:35:38.700]  refuse to cover it. The media has become nothing but a radical left-wing smear
[03:35:38.700 --> 03:35:44.340]  machine, propaganda machine, lying machine. And this is why today I repeat my
[03:35:44.340 --> 03:35:50.380]  call for President Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act. And in my opinion he
[03:35:50.380 --> 03:35:57.260]  should unleash military police to occupy Facebook, Google, Twitter, YouTube, and the
[03:35:57.260 --> 03:36:02.780]  others and arrest their CEOs for their criminal racketeering, their criminal
[03:36:02.780 --> 03:36:09.380]  terrorism, their complicity in child sex trafficking, which of course is one of
[03:36:09.380 --> 03:36:13.820]  the reasons why Democrats want to keep the border open so they can continue to
[03:36:13.820 --> 03:36:21.940]  funnel human cargo, you know, underage girls and boys, to big Democrat donors.
[03:36:21.940 --> 03:36:28.140]  And this whole house of cards is about to collapse. It's all coming down. And it's
[03:36:28.140 --> 03:36:34.420]  probably going to lead to civil war in America. I think that the radical left
[03:36:34.420 --> 03:36:37.320]  knows that that's coming. That's why they have this desperation, this
[03:36:37.320 --> 03:36:42.420]  acceleration of their insanity and their calls for censorship and their calls for
[03:36:42.420 --> 03:36:47.460]  just silencing and de-platforming everything that they don't like. And
[03:36:47.460 --> 03:36:52.140]  civil war is the likely result of all of this. And I want to bring your
[03:36:52.140 --> 03:36:58.020]  attention to a video. Search for this, guys. It's called Civil War 2 in America.
[03:36:58.020 --> 03:37:05.020]  Who Would Win by John Mark? It's currently on YouTube, has about a million views. Now
[03:37:05.020 --> 03:37:10.140]  as a disclaimer, I don't know who John Mark is, but this analysis by John Mark
[03:37:10.140 --> 03:37:17.460]  is spot-on. It's right on the money. This video is fantastic. You need to watch
[03:37:17.460 --> 03:37:21.980]  this video. In this video, John Mark, again, who I don't know, but this is a great
[03:37:21.980 --> 03:37:28.300]  analysis that he's done, but John Mark has quoted a person who says he was part
[03:37:28.300 --> 03:37:33.020]  of a red team operations analysis group working for the United States
[03:37:33.020 --> 03:37:37.740]  government, looking at what would happen in an actual civil war scenario if it
[03:37:37.740 --> 03:37:41.420]  were to break out in the United States. And what he points out in this video
[03:37:41.420 --> 03:37:48.940]  actually confirms what we've seen before in some other analyses by former
[03:37:48.940 --> 03:37:54.540]  special forces and so on that say the Achilles heel of the radical left is the
[03:37:54.540 --> 03:37:59.300]  power grid. The power grid feeds everything that the cities need to
[03:37:59.300 --> 03:38:03.300]  survive. The cities are where the Democrats are based. These cities, they
[03:38:03.300 --> 03:38:07.180]  have to have inputs in order to function. They have to have fuel deliveries,
[03:38:07.180 --> 03:38:13.300]  electricity deliveries, food deliveries, and water piked in, in the case of Los
[03:38:13.300 --> 03:38:19.220]  Angeles, literally pumped over a mountain into LA. And that these power grid
[03:38:19.220 --> 03:38:22.700]  substations and power grid infrastructure facilities, and I want to be
[03:38:22.700 --> 03:38:26.580]  clear, I'm not in any way advocating any kind of action or any kind of
[03:38:26.580 --> 03:38:31.100]  destruction of the power grid. I'm reporting to you what's being analyzed
[03:38:31.100 --> 03:38:36.860]  in this video of a possible civil war scenario. But in that scenario, it's
[03:38:36.860 --> 03:38:41.780]  pointed out by John Mark in this video that our national power grid was
[03:38:41.780 --> 03:38:46.700]  constructed at a time when no one ever thought that the power grid would be used
[03:38:46.700 --> 03:38:52.580]  or targeted in a civil war action. And thus the entire power grid nationwide is
[03:38:52.580 --> 03:38:58.860]  completely unprotected. And as it's said in this video, the substations can be
[03:38:58.860 --> 03:39:04.580]  taken down by long-range snipers, i.e. military-range snipers with certain
[03:39:04.580 --> 03:39:09.780]  cartridges, you know, 338 Lapua magnum or 50-cali what-have-you. They can, from
[03:39:09.780 --> 03:39:14.020]  thousands of yards away, they can take down power substations that are
[03:39:14.020 --> 03:39:18.420]  completely undefended. And then using this principle of asymmetric warfare, they
[03:39:18.420 --> 03:39:23.340]  can plunge the liberal cities into absolute chaos. Now, many of these liberal
[03:39:23.340 --> 03:39:27.180]  cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle, and many other
[03:39:27.180 --> 03:39:31.380]  Chicago, you know, they're already on the verge of collapse right now during the
[03:39:31.380 --> 03:39:40.220]  so-called good times in our economy. They are highly subject to systemic
[03:39:40.220 --> 03:39:46.340]  failures that could take place. And because of that, this asymmetric warfare
[03:39:46.340 --> 03:39:54.820]  could target them and take them down. Now, give me a, give me a word back here,
[03:39:54.820 --> 03:39:58.620]  guys, make sure that we're still connected because I'm seeing some issues.
[03:39:58.620 --> 03:40:03.180]  But, okay, all right, so just, just, just continuing. I don't know if we're being,
[03:40:03.180 --> 03:40:06.300]  you know, interrupted because of what I'm saying here, because of this analysis,
[03:40:06.300 --> 03:40:13.740]  but these cities in California and other liberal strongholds are highly
[03:40:13.740 --> 03:40:19.020]  vulnerable to this. And this is why, for your safety, I want to urge you to get out
[03:40:19.020 --> 03:40:25.180]  of the west coast of California. Get out before this thing goes into a collapsed
[03:40:25.180 --> 03:40:28.940]  scenario. And there's another reason that I'm going to bring to you in the next
[03:40:28.940 --> 03:40:34.660]  segment coming up in just a few minutes about the nuclear catastrophe that could
[03:40:34.660 --> 03:40:38.900]  happen due to the movement of tectonic plates in California and the San Andreas
[03:40:38.900 --> 03:40:42.780]  Fault. But I want you to understand, just to summarize that Civil War II analysis
[03:40:42.780 --> 03:40:49.140]  video, I want you to understand, if this goes to a Civil War, the left loses. The
[03:40:49.140 --> 03:40:54.620]  left loses almost overnight because all the firearms are in the hands of pro
[03:40:54.620 --> 03:41:00.020]  America's borders. The former military, active duty military, and even law
[03:41:00.020 --> 03:41:05.220]  enforcement are all, in fact, mostly on the side of America, on the side of
[03:41:05.220 --> 03:41:08.980]  protecting our borders, protecting our Constitution, and even defending our
[03:41:08.980 --> 03:41:13.620]  president. So the president himself, I believe, needs to invoke the Insurrection
[03:41:13.620 --> 03:41:19.140]  Act and take down the enemies of America. It's time for that to happen. And those
[03:41:19.140 --> 03:41:23.420]  enemies are becoming more bold, like Facebook, which is, of course, calling for
[03:41:23.420 --> 03:41:28.140]  essentially endorsing, embracing extreme violence and the mass killing of certain
[03:41:28.140 --> 03:41:31.660]  named individuals, like Paul Joseph Watson and Laura Loomer. And by the way,
[03:41:31.660 --> 03:41:36.220]  just as a side comedy note, isn't it interesting that Mark Zuckerberg, that
[03:41:36.220 --> 03:41:40.020]  came out in the news recently, Zuckerberg has commanded Facebook to go to
[03:41:40.020 --> 03:41:45.260]  extraordinary lengths to censor all comments on Facebook that characterize
[03:41:45.260 --> 03:41:51.220]  Mark Zuckerberg as an alien, which is, as I say comedically, exactly what an
[03:41:51.220 --> 03:41:56.180]  alien would do, isn't it? Who knows? I don't know what that guy is. I don't know
[03:41:56.180 --> 03:42:00.180]  if he's a cyborg. I don't know if he's an alien. I don't know if he's a demon. What
[03:42:00.180 --> 03:42:05.380]  I know is he's not human. That's for sure, because his agenda is not human. In fact,
[03:42:05.380 --> 03:42:09.420]  so much of the agenda that we're seeing right now is anti-human, all across the
[03:42:09.420 --> 03:42:13.020]  tech giants, all across the left wing media, all across the institutions of
[03:42:13.020 --> 03:42:17.380]  science and medicine, and think about it, pesticides, the food industry, the food
[03:42:17.380 --> 03:42:23.420]  supply, politics, banking, finance, it's all anti-human. The anti-human agenda is
[03:42:23.420 --> 03:42:27.780]  in charge, and it is desperately trying to destroy humanity and destroy any
[03:42:27.780 --> 03:42:32.460]  person or any institution that speaks out to defend humanity, like Alex Jones,
[03:42:32.460 --> 03:42:37.620]  like Info Wars, and so on. If you defend humanity, you are targeted for destruction,
[03:42:37.620 --> 03:42:42.860]  because humanity has been slated for annihilation. That's their ultimate goal.
[03:42:42.860 --> 03:42:47.620]  I'll have the nuclear analysis straight ahead after we return from this common
[03:42:47.620 --> 03:42:51.420]  break. Don't go anywhere. We'll be right back.
[03:42:52.780 --> 03:42:56.900]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most

[03:43:58.660 --> 03:44:02.340]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you and we're under
[03:44:02.340 --> 03:44:06.420]  unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen, but I wanted to take just a minute
[03:44:06.420 --> 03:44:10.140]  out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that
[03:44:10.140 --> 03:44:13.620]  when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about
[03:44:13.620 --> 03:44:16.740]  people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the
[03:44:16.740 --> 03:44:20.940]  truth. And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel
[03:44:20.940 --> 03:44:24.220]  your love in my heart. I want you know that love is right back at you and I
[03:44:24.220 --> 03:44:27.540]  want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers

[03:44:31.300 --> 03:44:35.420]  to win and without you I'm gonna be destroyed and it's not gonna be fun
[03:44:35.420 --> 03:44:39.660]  but that's not what's important. The enemy could win. We're a key chess piece
[03:44:39.660 --> 03:44:43.100]  in this fight. We're being used by God. You're being used by God. This is
[03:44:43.100 --> 03:44:46.820]  Providence, so I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom
[03:44:46.820 --> 03:44:53.700]  of my heart. InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:44:53.700 --> 03:45:02.140]  1776 worldwide. That's a term I coined 15 years ago. What does it really mean? It
[03:45:02.140 --> 03:45:07.180]  means the idea of American freedom renaissance worldwide. It doesn't mean
[03:45:07.180 --> 03:45:11.860]  we go conquer countries. It means our superior Western values of true
[03:45:11.860 --> 03:45:17.620]  freedom get adopted because compared to globalism, it's night and day. We're
[03:45:17.620 --> 03:45:23.700]  gonna do a 34-hour special broadcast that kicks off this Thursday morning at

[03:45:27.620 --> 03:45:32.900]  next day at 6 p.m. on the war room. We're gonna have our crew in D.C. at the
[03:45:32.900 --> 03:45:37.860]  White House summit on social media. We're gonna be at the after party with all the
[03:45:37.860 --> 03:45:41.540]  key folks taking action against censorship and so much more. So everybody
[03:45:41.540 --> 03:45:47.060]  share that link infowars.com forward slash show kicking off this Thursday at
[03:45:47.060 --> 03:45:54.140]  8 a.m. central at infowars.com forward slash show 1776 worldwide. The
[03:45:54.140 --> 03:45:58.460]  globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators. They are
[03:45:58.460 --> 03:46:02.060]  technocrats. They are control freaks in their own words and they believe
[03:46:02.060 --> 03:46:05.420]  allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way
[03:46:05.420 --> 03:46:09.820]  of their great destiny to merge with AI gods. Now we're fighting them hard in
[03:46:09.820 --> 03:46:13.580]  cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension. One of
[03:46:13.580 --> 03:46:17.260]  the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of
[03:46:17.260 --> 03:46:21.380]  control in our lives is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest quality
[03:46:21.380 --> 03:46:26.940]  supplements from 4slife.com I couldn't do it. That's why we decided to take our
[03:46:26.940 --> 03:46:31.540]  original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality megalomene and double the

[03:46:56.380 --> 03:47:01.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:01.780 --> 03:47:20.860]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones and now your host
[03:47:20.860 --> 03:47:27.780]  Mike Adams. Alright listen up folks I'm gonna have to blaze through this pretty
[03:47:27.780 --> 03:47:33.380]  quickly because this is about the nuclear meltdown threat in California. An
[03:47:33.380 --> 03:47:38.580]  analysis that we did I asked my team to look at the geolocations of the active
[03:47:38.580 --> 03:47:43.060]  and so-called decommissioned nuclear power plants in California that are
[03:47:43.060 --> 03:47:48.060]  still storing nuclear fuel on site and then to overlay those geolocations with
[03:47:48.060 --> 03:47:53.020]  the San Andreas fault line and for the producers there's a map there in that
[03:47:53.020 --> 03:47:59.060]  article that you can show that shows us. So what we find is that this fault line
[03:47:59.060 --> 03:48:03.860]  which of course runs sort of parallel to the west coast of California the San
[03:48:03.860 --> 03:48:09.540]  Andreas fault line is very close to five out of six of these nuclear power
[03:48:09.540 --> 03:48:14.620]  plants not far away at all and we've also overlayed that with a risk map
[03:48:14.620 --> 03:48:19.060]  showing the color-coded risk of severe earthquakes in the next 30 years and
[03:48:19.060 --> 03:48:22.540]  you'll find that an astonishing number of these nuclear power plants in
[03:48:22.540 --> 03:48:28.020]  California were built in high risk zones seems insane doesn't it only one of
[03:48:28.020 --> 03:48:31.700]  them was built in a low risk zone and one of the power plants the Humboldt
[03:48:31.700 --> 03:48:36.260]  plant I believe up near north of San Francisco was built almost exactly on
[03:48:36.260 --> 03:48:40.860]  the San Andreas fault line. Another plant the current active plant the Diablo
[03:48:40.860 --> 03:48:46.420]  Canyon plant was built on the ocean line the coastline right on the ocean it
[03:48:46.420 --> 03:48:50.220]  uses ocean water for cooling which mimics the situation of the Fukushima
[03:48:50.220 --> 03:48:55.340]  Daiichi power plants in Japan. Now what this means is that California has a
[03:48:55.340 --> 03:48:59.980]  Fukushima type of scenario already set up and ready to be triggered all it's
[03:48:59.980 --> 03:49:05.260]  going to take is one ocean earthquake and that nuclear power plant will be
[03:49:05.260 --> 03:49:10.540]  inundated with a massive tidal wave tsunami you could say I guess it's not a
[03:49:10.540 --> 03:49:14.540]  tidal wave it's a earthquake caused wave not caused by moon's gravity but
[03:49:14.540 --> 03:49:19.500]  let's call it a tsunami that could swamp that nuclear power facility and in
[03:49:19.500 --> 03:49:23.700]  fact there are underwater volcanoes underwater earthquakes all throughout
[03:49:23.700 --> 03:49:29.000]  the Pacific and an underwater caldera kind of like Yellowstone but it's
[03:49:29.000 --> 03:49:33.780]  located hundreds of miles to the west of the coast of Oregon. Any of these
[03:49:33.780 --> 03:49:39.660]  events could be set off at any time we can't predict them as humans even our
[03:49:39.660 --> 03:49:44.460]  best scientists can't predict them at any given time an ocean wave could travel
[03:49:44.460 --> 03:49:48.940]  faster than the speed of sound and can inundate that Diablo Canyon nuclear
[03:49:48.940 --> 03:49:54.020]  power plant and cause a meltdown also an earthquake could cause this as well now
[03:49:54.020 --> 03:49:56.860]  a couple of things you need to know about this number one the San Andreas
[03:49:56.860 --> 03:50:01.100]  fault line what is it exactly well you need to think about two continents
[03:50:01.100 --> 03:50:05.660]  colliding the west coast that's west of the San Andreas fault line that thin a
[03:50:05.660 --> 03:50:12.220]  strip of land that encompasses what San Diego Los Angeles San Francisco and
[03:50:12.220 --> 03:50:15.900]  others that is part of really a different continent you might say a
[03:50:15.900 --> 03:50:20.620]  different tectonic plate actually that's moving to the north now everything
[03:50:20.620 --> 03:50:25.100]  east of the San Andreas fault line is not moving to the north it's moving
[03:50:25.100 --> 03:50:28.380]  slightly to the south or you could say it's not moving at all because it's
[03:50:28.380 --> 03:50:32.340]  moving very little relatively speaking what this means is that there are going
[03:50:32.340 --> 03:50:36.540]  to be massive earthquakes because these continents essentially these plates are
[03:50:36.540 --> 03:50:42.380]  shifting relative to each other on a known speed and when you have a long
[03:50:42.380 --> 03:50:46.260]  period of no earthquakes or very low frequency of earthquakes what it means
[03:50:46.260 --> 03:50:50.660]  is that the tectonic plates are building up massive tension a lot of energy is
[03:50:50.660 --> 03:50:57.020]  being built up like pulling back a catapult locking mechanism you know and
[03:50:57.020 --> 03:51:01.580]  eventually that energy has to be released so the longer that the earthquakes
[03:51:01.580 --> 03:51:06.820]  have been quiet the bigger the release of energy when it's finally unleashed you
[03:51:06.820 --> 03:51:11.060]  can have a massive slippage of the tectonic plates and this is going to
[03:51:11.060 --> 03:51:17.620]  cause very a very high intensity earthquake the big one is what's
[03:51:17.620 --> 03:51:21.060]  concerned that is the concern of people who are living in California and
[03:51:21.060 --> 03:51:25.620]  watching all of this because a big one ie a 9.0 on the Richter scale which is
[03:51:25.620 --> 03:51:30.700]  a hundred times larger than a 7.0 could destroy all these nuclear power
[03:51:30.700 --> 03:51:34.540]  facilities and even the power facilities that are so-called decommissioned
[03:51:34.540 --> 03:51:39.940]  many of them are actually in a state called safe store which PG&E the
[03:51:39.940 --> 03:51:45.860]  California power company says that safe store stores the nuclear fuel on site
[03:51:45.860 --> 03:51:50.780]  in pooling pools and then they cool this nuclear fuel for many many years until
[03:51:50.780 --> 03:51:55.100]  one day they actually remove the nuclear fuel but it's not clear which of these
[03:51:55.100 --> 03:51:59.220]  plants still have nuclear fuel stored on site we know some of them do but it's
[03:51:59.220 --> 03:52:05.260]  not clear which ones don't and a 9.0 earthquake could collapse the
[03:52:05.260 --> 03:52:09.780]  containment pools which is exactly what happened in Fukushima it could collapse
[03:52:09.780 --> 03:52:13.500]  the containment structure collapse the concrete buildings and it could cause
[03:52:13.500 --> 03:52:21.060]  offline fuel to come into close contact because it's fissionable material and it
[03:52:21.060 --> 03:52:25.980]  can reach a criticality so you can have meltdowns of nuclear fuel in offline
[03:52:25.980 --> 03:52:29.580]  nuclear power plants following an earthquake or a tsunami or some other
[03:52:29.580 --> 03:52:33.940]  natural event now then when that happens you have the release of radio isotopes
[03:52:33.940 --> 03:52:40.100]  of course you get strontium 90 you get cesium 137 you get various isotopes of
[03:52:40.100 --> 03:52:45.420]  plutonium and uranium some of those decay into americium and other elements
[03:52:45.420 --> 03:52:49.980]  depending on the schedule of the half lives but cesium 137 has a half life of
[03:52:49.980 --> 03:52:55.660]  about 30 years which means that southern California would be made uninhabitable
[03:52:55.660 --> 03:53:01.340]  by humans for about 300 years now I know what you're thinking you might be
[03:53:01.340 --> 03:53:05.340]  thinking well gosh Los Angeles is barely habitable by humans right now you
[03:53:05.340 --> 03:53:08.180]  know you look at the feces on the streets of San Francisco you look at the
[03:53:08.180 --> 03:53:14.260]  Tenble cities you look at the collapse of California but it's not radioactive yet
[03:53:14.260 --> 03:53:20.220]  it could be made radioactive overnight because the geniuses in California built
[03:53:20.220 --> 03:53:25.220]  nuclear power plants right along the San Andreas fault line which is about as
[03:53:25.220 --> 03:53:30.620]  insane and suicidal as building a nuclear power facility on the coastline of
[03:53:30.620 --> 03:53:34.980]  Japan in the ring of fire where underground earthquakes and volcanoes and
[03:53:34.980 --> 03:53:40.620]  tsunamis are a regular occurrence this is the situation we are all in the sad
[03:53:40.620 --> 03:53:43.940]  news is that this isn't just a danger to California it's a danger to all of
[03:53:43.940 --> 03:53:47.860]  North America and yet people are living right there in California and thinking
[03:53:47.860 --> 03:53:51.980]  the government's taking care of them thinking PG&E has this under control
[03:53:51.980 --> 03:53:58.260]  but back in 2014 PG&E requested about a billion dollars just to continue the
[03:53:58.260 --> 03:54:02.220]  decommissioning effort for one nuclear power plant there I think that was the
[03:54:02.220 --> 03:54:06.260]  Humboldt plant and they've scheduled the Diablo Canyon plant to be decommissioned
[03:54:06.260 --> 03:54:10.660]  in the year 2025 but that process might take a decade or longer and require
[03:54:10.660 --> 03:54:16.660]  billions of dollars but guess what in January this year PG&E declared bankruptcy
[03:54:16.660 --> 03:54:21.660]  and the state of California is suffering an economic collapse as the
[03:54:21.660 --> 03:54:25.980]  taxpayers are fleeing the state and the state promises to have free health care
[03:54:25.980 --> 03:54:30.540]  for illegal aliens and other handouts so that Democrats can stay in power and
[03:54:30.540 --> 03:54:32.980]  continue to destroy everything that they run
[03:54:32.980 --> 03:54:38.580]  California will financially collapse when it does my question to you is who
[03:54:38.580 --> 03:54:43.420]  will continue to cool the nuclear fuel rods at these multiple nuclear facilities
[03:54:43.420 --> 03:54:48.100]  that are subject to earthquakes and volcanoes and underground tsunamis I
[03:54:48.100 --> 03:54:53.180]  mean ocean tsunamis and underground under ocean caldera explosions and other
[03:54:53.180 --> 03:54:57.780]  types of phenomena like that who's going to pay the money who's going to have
[03:54:57.780 --> 03:55:03.260]  the proficiency to deal with this nuclear fuel and the answer is nobody
[03:55:03.260 --> 03:55:07.820]  because government is incompetent instead of fixing these problems they
[03:55:07.820 --> 03:55:11.580]  will turn off the dosimeters they will lie to you and say they have it under
[03:55:11.580 --> 03:55:17.100]  control they'll call it clean green energy while you're being killed with
[03:55:17.100 --> 03:55:22.260]  cesium 137 exposure because government is incompetent and the California
[03:55:22.260 --> 03:55:27.540]  government is criminally incompetent if you are living anywhere in California
[03:55:27.540 --> 03:55:33.860]  you are living in a future hot radiation zone a mad max collapse nuclear
[03:55:33.860 --> 03:55:39.660]  apocalypse scenario you need to get out just to have any chance to survive at
[03:55:39.660 --> 03:55:44.380]  all now there's more to the story and it involves Chernobyl remember the nuclear
[03:55:44.380 --> 03:55:52.860]  disaster of 1986 Chernobyl went into a meltdown the Russian government Soviet
[03:55:52.860 --> 03:55:56.660]  Union at the time because Ukraine was a Republic of the Soviet Union they
[03:55:56.660 --> 03:56:01.740]  hurriedly put a lot of concrete and they they entombed that nuclear disaster in
[03:56:01.740 --> 03:56:06.140]  what was called the sarcophagus well the lifetime of that thing which had no
[03:56:06.140 --> 03:56:11.500]  foundation was estimated to be only 25 to 30 years and it started crumbling so
[03:56:11.500 --> 03:56:17.100]  in 2007 European nations led by a French engineering firm and funded by the
[03:56:17.100 --> 03:56:21.660]  United States Japan and others decided to build a new covering over the
[03:56:21.660 --> 03:56:26.500]  Chernobyl power plant because the fuel there will threaten humanity for 24,000
[03:56:26.500 --> 03:56:32.740]  years Chernobyl's not over so they spent a lot of money and over a decade building
[03:56:32.740 --> 03:56:37.300]  a new cover it's an arched cover it's there now they completed this I think in
[03:56:37.300 --> 03:56:42.300]  2017 but guess what because there's so much radiation in there you can't
[03:56:42.300 --> 03:56:47.580]  maintain the steel beams that are constructing this arch so you have to
[03:56:47.580 --> 03:56:53.260]  prevent corrosion which is caused by humidity so they are running right now
[03:56:53.260 --> 03:56:59.020]  24-7 they are running massive dehumidifiers to dehumidify the air to
[03:56:59.020 --> 03:57:03.700]  prevent that arch from corroding and collapsing and releasing hundreds of
[03:57:03.700 --> 03:57:09.620]  times the nuclear contamination of the Hiroshima bomb into the environment
[03:57:09.620 --> 03:57:13.860]  because Chernobyl's not over and this arch is only slated to last a hundred
[03:57:13.860 --> 03:57:19.300]  years and that's if they can keep the dehumidifiers running which will stop
[03:57:19.300 --> 03:57:23.460]  if there's a financial collapse think about that we are not out of the woods
[03:57:23.460 --> 03:57:28.100]  on any of this things are bad stay informed keep watching info wars.com
[03:57:28.100 --> 03:57:33.020]  read news wars.com check out my website natural news.com thank you for joining
[03:57:33.020 --> 03:57:37.540]  today sorry I didn't have more time to explain more but stay informed this is
[03:57:37.540 --> 03:57:44.580]  Mike Adams here thanks for watching stay safe I just want listeners to
[03:57:44.580 --> 03:57:48.740]  understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against us and we're
[03:57:48.740 --> 03:57:52.700]  seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info wars 50% off but we make
[03:57:52.700 --> 03:57:56.580]  only like five ten dollars on higher marked up stuff we're making like two
[03:57:56.580 --> 03:58:00.740]  dollars on the toothpaste at that price and we're moving a ton okay but you move
[03:58:00.740 --> 03:58:03.620]  a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get twenty thousand
[03:58:03.620 --> 03:58:06.340]  dollars that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure the bandwidth the lawyers
[03:58:06.340 --> 03:58:09.460]  the crew so we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars of
[03:58:09.460 --> 03:58:13.380]  product I want to expand not contract and for six months we've not just been
[03:58:13.380 --> 03:58:16.860]  to stand still the enemy's been winning and I have labored and labored and
[03:58:16.860 --> 03:58:20.540]  labored and labored on this I like to be expanding I like to be winning I like
[03:58:20.540 --> 03:58:23.540]  to be fighting and we are winning the info war that's why we're so hated but we
[03:58:23.540 --> 03:58:27.500]  need to be retreaded we need to be tuned up we need to be fixed up we never have
[03:58:27.500 --> 03:58:30.940]  time to get it to dry out we got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants
[03:58:30.940 --> 03:58:35.100]  to silence us then they're really gonna plant child porn on us then they're
[03:58:35.100 --> 03:58:38.060]  gonna kill me or you or anybody else I mean the Democrats now we're going into
[03:58:38.060 --> 03:58:41.500]  a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks in the chai comp show go
[03:58:41.500 --> 03:58:46.380]  to infowarsstore.com let's talk to Marcus in New York Marcus you're on the air
[03:58:46.380 --> 03:58:50.380]  thanks for holding yeah I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air I
[03:58:50.380 --> 03:58:53.860]  talked to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you
[03:58:53.860 --> 03:58:57.700]  is that almost nobody agrees with these wars I think that the neo cons are
[03:58:57.700 --> 03:59:01.540]  trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the
[03:59:01.540 --> 03:59:05.220]  only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching
[03:59:05.220 --> 03:59:08.660]  2020 that's it I mean if Trump buys into this it'll be the end of his
[03:59:08.660 --> 03:59:11.700]  presidency it's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating
[03:59:11.700 --> 03:59:14.780]  him it's a time to be praying my friend I agree entirely and the last thing I
[03:59:14.780 --> 03:59:17.900]  just want to say Alex is I know they're trying to shut you down but the
[03:59:17.900 --> 03:59:21.940]  reinforcements have arrived man I would love to see you on air until you're 80
[03:59:21.940 --> 03:59:25.100]  years old I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they
[03:59:25.100 --> 03:59:29.780]  do shut you down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and
[03:59:29.780 --> 03:59:33.340]  there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are gonna continue
[03:59:33.340 --> 03:59:37.100]  we're gonna keep fighting in the info war and even if something does happen to
[03:59:37.100 --> 03:59:41.380]  you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up
[03:59:41.380 --> 03:59:44.980]  for liberty thank you sir for calling
[03:59:44.980 --> 03:59:51.780]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
