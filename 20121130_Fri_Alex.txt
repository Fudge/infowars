[00:00.000 --> 00:13.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.560 --> 00:34.640]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen
[00:34.640 --> 00:44.840]  we are live it is Friday the 30th day of November 2012 and former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney
[00:44.840 --> 00:51.000]  is scheduled to join us in the second hour then Jason rank and Tom Woods Jason rank will be in
[00:51.000 --> 01:00.000]  studio they're moving forward with the nullification secession movement as the media has been dubbing
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.440]  yet but that's not really what it is so we're going to be explaining that and continuing my
[01:05.440 --> 01:10.840]  call for a new declaration of independence to restore the Republic get it out of the hands of
[01:10.840 --> 01:17.040]  the globalist that bragged that they've conquered this country the piece is almost done and then
[01:17.040 --> 01:22.360]  Aaron's got to export it because it's an HD there's a piece we've been working on for three days
[01:22.360 --> 01:30.160]  here that deals with JP Morgan Chase running a TV ad during Thanksgiving and still running it
[01:30.160 --> 01:44.920]  implying that they brought you America implying that that everything good in this country is because
[01:44.920 --> 01:51.720]  of them and so I thought we'd go over the real history of JP Morgan Chase because they claim
[01:51.720 --> 01:56.240]  what they're doing is free market it's the opposite and is destroying any free market
[01:56.240 --> 02:03.520]  we could ever have and our prosperity even more evil than Goldman Sachs is JP Morgan Chase so
[02:03.520 --> 02:09.480]  that should be done sometime in the third hour and so we're going to be premiering that here on

[08:15.880 --> 08:25.640]  more so than ever before this broadcast is an absolute must listen the global government
[08:25.640 --> 08:31.560]  is openly being announced run by private mega banks hell bent on destroying sovereign nations
[08:31.560 --> 08:37.080]  and free markets and replacing it with above the law corporate fascist global combines
[08:37.800 --> 08:43.960]  using socialism at the grassroots to make the public dumb down and dependent we have an absolute
[08:43.960 --> 08:53.320]  total information overload today even the daily beast the newsweek group says no answers in death
[08:53.320 --> 09:00.280]  of coroner link to Andrew Breitbart we told you he was killed with arson at the time that's now
[09:00.280 --> 09:06.440]  come out and there's basically no investigation going on Breitbart the evidence points towards
[09:06.440 --> 09:10.920]  being murdered because they announced he died of natural causes in less than an hour before
[09:10.920 --> 09:16.280]  any coroner even looked at him we've got that in the stack that's not even our top story there's
[09:16.280 --> 09:24.520]  just so much here the west is back backing al-qaeda in the takeover of syria it is so incredibly
[09:24.520 --> 09:30.520]  immoral and they are now reporting in the weekly standard they're claiming oh surface to air
[09:31.240 --> 09:36.600]  anti-aircraft missiles oh they got them from the syrian government to shoot down syrian
[09:36.600 --> 09:43.080]  helicopters and jets no they got them in libya from qaddafi and al-qaeda was given that by
[09:43.080 --> 09:46.680]  nato and that's on record so they're now already trying to say that missiles that are going to be
[09:46.680 --> 09:51.240]  shooting down passenger liners undoubtedly in the near future they're going to blame it on a sod
[09:51.240 --> 09:56.520]  and think the public is that dumb they're using the missiles to bring down a sod and put al-qaeda in
[09:56.520 --> 10:02.360]  charge just like they've done in libya and the muslim brotherhood in egypt and they think you're
[10:02.360 --> 10:08.200]  so stupid they're all over the news not just the weekly standard saying oh they're turning the tide
[10:08.200 --> 10:14.520]  against the sod in the 20 month war because they've got anti-aircraft missiles from a sod it bases
[10:14.520 --> 10:21.960]  they've taken absolute total and complete bull but they admit in the back of the paper that cia
[10:21.960 --> 10:29.240]  mi6 and others have commandos on the ground with us special forces lazing targets to take over that
[10:29.240 --> 10:35.640]  country and to blow up the churches kill the jews which is going on and it's in the foreign papers
[10:35.640 --> 10:41.800]  but not here it is unbelievable and then you or i are told we have to give up our rights because
[10:41.800 --> 10:47.160]  of al-qaeda when the bankers that have hijacked this country run al-qaeda and i just don't think
[10:47.160 --> 10:53.400]  you're that stupid i mean even neocon radios have to talk about this now i mean just just just shame
[10:53.400 --> 10:58.680]  on all of you that have gotten behind the police state you are destroying our country and our future
[10:58.680 --> 11:05.320]  and the golden goose that has made this country so so productive the dollar is on the way out they're
[11:05.320 --> 11:11.800]  going to move towards global s dr cashless systems backed by the imf and world bank and and those
[11:11.800 --> 11:17.720]  systems backed by global carbon taxes global vat it's all been announced at davos the 100 trillion
[11:17.720 --> 11:24.120]  dollar plan associated press london guardian london telegraph we've covered it in osium but they
[11:24.120 --> 11:29.080]  have to incrementally bankrupt things europe the u.s the rest of the world while mopping up the few
[11:29.080 --> 11:35.720]  rogue nations the globalists don't control while posing as saviors uh and then saying oh my gosh
[11:35.720 --> 11:40.360]  we're going to go completely bankrupt our debts too great if we don't pass vat and carbon taxes
[11:41.080 --> 11:45.240]  and that's what you'll see this year or in the next two to three years that they're already proposing
[11:46.360 --> 11:51.160]  and well i don't want my 401k to go down to zero the stock market just dropped 4 000 points
[11:51.720 --> 11:58.040]  we better accept all these new taxes so the government can nationalize all the 401ks and
[11:58.040 --> 12:03.400]  everything and shore up the dollar and then a few years after that things won't be shored up just
[12:03.400 --> 12:09.800]  look at europe three quote bailouts that's just three implosions consolidating things and taking
[12:09.800 --> 12:14.200]  the new tax money that implodes the economy further and paying it to the globalist and then
[12:14.200 --> 12:19.720]  they're going to just get rid of cash entirely you will still have hundred dollar and thousand
[12:19.720 --> 12:23.480]  dollar bills this has been the state of plan by the federal reserve so they've changed it with
[12:23.480 --> 12:29.240]  color money and stuff getting you ready for this but they will have digital tracker chips in them
[12:29.240 --> 12:37.400]  which uh five dollar bills and up already have uh and with those devices but also scannable fronts
[12:38.040 --> 12:45.160]  it will track each bill and its full history so it is a cashless note and the big banks are exempt
[12:45.160 --> 12:49.720]  from all that they can launder hundreds of billions in drug money they won't get in trouble it'll just
[12:49.720 --> 12:54.920]  be to totally control your life like louis like louisiana did last year banning cash and second
[12:54.920 --> 13:00.520]  hand transactions that's going to go worldwide and here it is out of the associated press today
[13:01.240 --> 13:08.040]  congress looks at doing away with the one dollar bill i was on drudgereport.com there to go and
[13:08.040 --> 13:12.520]  they've got the one dollar bill the obama's face on it we can punch that up for people watching at
[13:12.520 --> 13:19.960]  info wars news dot com and it says the end of the dollar bill uh right there but uh yeah there it is
[13:19.960 --> 13:27.560]  obama on the cover the end of the dollar of the dollar bill and there's also another thing where
[13:27.560 --> 13:33.320]  you've got uh french socialists we're just doing what obama does obama's nationalized
[13:35.640 --> 13:41.800]  is a very modern step to take the french say yes see again nationalization but that means by private
[13:41.800 --> 13:47.960]  interest that control the nationalization it's even worse than kind of a de gaulle style nationalization
[13:49.000 --> 13:54.760]  all right continuing here congress looks at doing away with the one dollar bill american consumers
[13:54.760 --> 14:01.320]  have shown about as much appetite for the one dollar coin as kids do their spinach you're like
[14:01.320 --> 14:06.200]  children see oh you know you don't know best they may not know what's best for them either oh
[14:06.200 --> 14:12.600]  it's always the condescension because the people that write and work for the system they're all on
[14:12.600 --> 14:18.040]  these power trips i've i've met hundreds of them it's all part of you know they know everybody's
[14:18.040 --> 14:23.480]  being lied to they know things are corrupt but they think they're winners just going along with it
[14:23.480 --> 14:28.200]  and playing games with it congressional auditors say doing away with the dollar bills entirely
[14:28.200 --> 14:33.640]  replacing with dollar coins could save taxpayers 4.4 billion over the next 30 years oh yes
[14:33.640 --> 14:38.680]  yes vending machine operators are long champion the use of one dollar coins because they don't jam
[14:38.680 --> 14:42.360]  the machines and it just goes on and then of course they can issue less of the coins that's
[14:42.360 --> 14:46.280]  actually the plan uh with the general accounting office but they don't tell you that they're just
[14:46.280 --> 14:53.480]  phasing out cash all together so that is some of the news uh we've got some good news at least
[14:53.480 --> 15:02.200]  on the surface you turn senate moves to eliminate indefinite detention provision of the ndaa also
[15:02.200 --> 15:08.840]  faa drone operators have zero privacy obligations agency is now going to use drones to grab your
[15:08.840 --> 15:13.640]  wireless communications and your data and mark your homes and track you well of course it's skynet
[15:15.560 --> 15:22.440]  also we have headlines like this out of la cbs news city attorney tell san bernanino residents
[15:22.440 --> 15:30.440]  to lock their doors load their guns because of police downsizing and the city is chastising
[15:30.440 --> 15:34.760]  them saying don't say that all over the country they're laying off police and then hiring code
[15:34.760 --> 15:41.400]  enforcers or making police kind of a metro model where part of the police are code enforcers so
[15:41.400 --> 15:46.360]  you're dealing with a code enforcer with a badge and a gun look out because they write those codes
[15:46.360 --> 15:52.360]  any objectionable material we $2,000 a day fines well now they're up to 5,000 some municipalities
[15:52.360 --> 15:56.920]  and a cop shows up with a gun and you're like well it's two inch grass they're like uh i find it
[15:56.920 --> 16:01.320]  objectionable hey you can't have this garden well the city says you can have gardens front or backyard
[16:02.120 --> 16:08.120]  sorry you know if you're in deerfield michigan uh sorry uh we say it's objectionable this is the
[16:08.120 --> 16:14.360]  new tyranny agenda 21 that rosa quarry's book uh behind the green mass that we sell it in full
[16:14.360 --> 16:20.040]  wars dot com you know breaks down but but all of that is coming up today and i dovetail that with
[16:20.040 --> 16:27.960]  auto zone employee fired after taking action against fake beard bandit the fake beard bandit had robbed
[16:27.960 --> 16:35.160]  dozens and dozens what more than 30 businesses on the peninsula so the guy had a gun out threatening
[16:35.160 --> 16:40.440]  people the guy went out the back door got his gun came in stopped the guy and uh he's in big trouble
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.640]  back they're talking about criminal charges now because you don't protect yourself
[16:45.640 --> 16:54.120]  you don't protect yourself you just go grovel in fear so so the city attorney is in trouble
[16:55.480 --> 16:59.080]  uh for telling the truth the police are in trouble all over the country for telling the truth
[17:00.200 --> 17:04.760]  and saying you should arm yourself the idea that government can and will protect you police
[17:04.760 --> 17:11.000]  have no liability to protect you because they can't they're to respond under state and federal law
[17:11.000 --> 17:19.720]  law depending on which type they are when a crime is committed to bring you before a grand jury
[17:21.960 --> 17:25.880]  and then to bring you ultimately to go to trial before a jury because we the people run things
[17:26.440 --> 17:34.680]  they are to seek you out they are not to enforce laws they are peace officers
[17:36.120 --> 17:40.680]  when they see the peace being broken when they see bullies doing something when they see some
[17:40.680 --> 17:45.960]  if they see a crime they're to respond but their their main job is to take you to jail
[17:46.520 --> 17:52.600]  to then have a fair trial to go to prison or to not go to prison they are to go out and get you
[17:54.840 --> 17:58.920]  alive preferably but if it's violent crimes and you've been known to kill innocent people
[17:58.920 --> 18:06.520]  then the court says dead or alive this person has been shown to be violent and killing people dead
[18:06.520 --> 18:14.440]  or alive but then you've got to be told by the court dead or alive you've got to be given a
[18:14.440 --> 18:21.560]  death warrant dead or alive instead now they have SWAT teams with a dead or alive precept under
[18:21.560 --> 18:26.200]  false law who say well we think drugs might be involved we're going to come in and kill anybody
[18:26.200 --> 18:31.400]  that doesn't put their hands up in one half second who may be half asleep you see I happen to study
[18:31.400 --> 18:36.760]  common law I happen to study not just the Declaration of Independence Bill of Rights Constitution but
[18:36.760 --> 18:43.080]  the Magna Carta I've read it you should read it see I know the 800 plus years of our law that's
[18:43.080 --> 18:47.640]  based on even more ancient common sense law that's all been worked out down throughout the ages
[18:47.640 --> 18:52.920]  I want that back I want my due process back I want it back right now
[18:52.920 --> 18:58.760]  all right continuing here ladies and gentlemen
[19:01.720 --> 19:07.560]  I have some news that the magnitude is so great but plus it's something that I know

[24:19.720 --> 24:29.320]  a in-depth report out of the daily mail that's in the british medical journal
[24:29.320 --> 24:33.080]  it's in a bunch of other newspapers but the mail has the biggest most in-depth article
[24:33.640 --> 24:40.440]  now sick babies go on death pathway doctors haunting testimony reveals how children are put on
[24:40.440 --> 24:47.160]  end of life plan and they're starved to death uh and again this focuses on babies it describes
[24:47.160 --> 24:53.400]  14 year olds begging for food and water blood coming out of their mouth as as they are dehydrated
[24:53.400 --> 25:01.960]  over 14 days and again i've been covering this for at least since 1998 when i discovered this was
[25:01.960 --> 25:07.480]  going on this is premeditated this is planned this is globally standardized they are now killing
[25:07.480 --> 25:12.840]  people who can walk i'm gonna say that again we have their names they are now killing people who
[25:12.840 --> 25:17.880]  can walk here in the united states england and europe it's all standardized you remember uh paul
[25:17.880 --> 25:22.760]  watson broke that article back in february then got picked up by fox news roiders you name it
[25:22.760 --> 25:28.200]  ethicists argue killing newborn babies should be allowed in the prestigious journal of medical ethics
[25:28.920 --> 25:33.960]  they said we need to kill children up to age three including healthy children of the parents
[25:33.960 --> 25:39.880]  don't want them and you're like well that doesn't sound real for three days when this article came
[25:39.880 --> 25:44.840]  out people thought it wasn't real even though there was a link to the journal of medical ethics
[25:46.280 --> 25:50.840]  and then it became a national story folks this has been going on a long time it's called eugenics
[25:51.560 --> 25:57.000]  and this is the tip of the iceberg now i'm going to read this coming up and if you i think everybody
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.400]  should be including children so you know what's happening but i will describe children begging
[26:01.400 --> 26:05.880]  for mommy shriveled up with blood pouring out of their eyes and they call it this is what's
[26:05.880 --> 26:12.120]  really sick about it they call this the humane way to kill them i mean we're so far gone ladies and

[36:39.160 --> 36:44.840]  health service they do that parallel to a private health service then they use that to bankrupt the
[36:44.840 --> 36:50.120]  private health service by making it be part of the public health service then government comes in
[36:50.120 --> 36:55.560]  to lower cost because it always bankrupts things and says well we're not going to give you a knee
[36:55.560 --> 37:01.080]  surgery if you're over 60 we're not going to give you an eye surgery if you're over 65 well
[37:03.800 --> 37:10.680]  we're making you do prenatal screening and it shows your child is at risk of a genetic disorder
[37:10.680 --> 37:15.080]  developing it we're going to force an abortion by the way i saw an article two weeks ago where
[37:15.080 --> 37:20.520]  they forced an abortion on a handicapped woman saying there was a chance her child might have it
[37:20.520 --> 37:25.080]  was in multiple sclerosis ladies and gentlemen they can look into anybody and find genetic
[37:25.080 --> 37:31.320]  traits that may flick on this is a total brave new world gattaca tyranny and gattaca and brave
[37:31.320 --> 37:36.600]  new world are based on the top eugenics family that came out of a genetic breeding program
[37:36.600 --> 37:43.480]  from 1852 until 1925 when the program was terminated the hoxley's the wedgewoods the galtons the
[37:43.480 --> 37:50.200]  darwins and one other family i cover it in endgame this is what runs everything this is the heart
[37:50.200 --> 38:01.080]  of it all by the 1935 close to 40 states 33 had total the 39 had partial where they would take
[38:01.080 --> 38:08.600]  children if they had low test scores of their parents did or if someone had a a a a a tick as
[38:08.600 --> 38:14.200]  they called it a neurological disorder they would pull up with a truck in the united states the
[38:14.200 --> 38:20.760]  nazis got it all from us we got it from england mexico did this too it was all the rage they would
[38:20.760 --> 38:29.560]  come in and grab your children black white they didn't care mainly white because their view was all
[38:29.560 --> 38:34.280]  the blacks were subhumans they just use them as basically as fodder but they said they would go and
[38:34.280 --> 38:40.440]  grab white children they had newsreels i show you newsreels in endgame where it shows them taking
[38:40.440 --> 38:49.480]  people and killing babies doctors killing babies is from the 30s a doctor killing a baby in these
[38:49.480 --> 38:55.160]  short films they would show before movies when the talkies first came out for that they were silent
[38:55.160 --> 38:59.160]  or he does somebody playing a piano in there this is all an endgame all i've done is read over 100
[38:59.160 --> 39:04.120]  books on this i mean if this is them saying it this is not my opinion now i want you to listen to
[39:04.120 --> 39:08.760]  me i'm going to read out of this daily mail article but i want you to understand something
[39:08.760 --> 39:16.920]  this is a whitewash and not because the daily mail writer feon mar k is bad but because they
[39:16.920 --> 39:22.280]  don't haven't studied it the doctors are going public that they watch babies children 14 year
[39:22.280 --> 39:28.360]  olds begging shriveling up their tongue stuck to their mouth blood coming out blood coming out of
[39:28.360 --> 39:36.120]  their eyes dehydration is ultra painful on average it takes about 14 days to murder somebody with it
[39:37.480 --> 39:43.400]  and they call it humane to see see they know how to do something totally sick because they're
[39:43.400 --> 39:48.440]  psych warfare experts they do something over the top and then it's act like it's normal
[39:48.440 --> 39:53.880]  just like they're putting cameras in for 10 years in school showers with elementary school girls at
[39:53.880 --> 39:59.000]  p e and and and the news is like what's the big deal having a camera in the shower
[40:01.240 --> 40:11.640]  it's it's all to be over the top to break your will okay now at 3 a.m i hear my wife's next to me
[40:11.640 --> 40:14.760]  on her phone reading articles she wakes up sometimes in the middle of the night
[40:17.240 --> 40:19.480]  and i wake up and i start reading it
[40:19.480 --> 40:26.840]  and we're sitting there in the dark reading and i read the whole daily mail article and i
[40:26.840 --> 40:33.240]  can't go back to sleep 15 pages and while i'm reading and i'm getting frustrated that they
[40:33.240 --> 40:37.800]  don't understand the full story not even five percent of it that i'm not articulate enough to
[40:37.800 --> 40:43.240]  explain to you how bad this is and how real it is i'm not exaggerating it's worse than i can tell you
[40:43.240 --> 40:49.400]  you and and i want to carry this book in the bookstore so everybody has it front and center
[40:49.400 --> 40:53.720]  but i'm going to plug it right now to his book culture of death weasley smith wall street journal
[40:53.720 --> 41:02.120]  writer he has taken photos he has interviewed him he has gone in to the hospitals where people
[41:02.120 --> 41:08.760]  can walk but they don't have any family they get signed in as wards of the state and they actually
[41:08.760 --> 41:15.480]  chain you down while you beg for food and water and i've had the nurses call in and say it's
[41:15.480 --> 41:20.520]  incredible this old woman i was sneaking her ice cubes they had her tied down and they dehydrated
[41:20.520 --> 41:26.920]  her to death once they get the bioethics board to say yeah you got a breast cancer we're not
[41:26.920 --> 41:31.560]  going to treat it it would take six years to grow on average till it kills you we're just going to go
[41:31.560 --> 41:37.000]  ahead and deny you food and water and and these people go honey can i have a little ice and
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.800]  nurses get fired when they recognize they're murdering people in the town i live in austin
[41:41.800 --> 41:48.120]  right now murdering them they've got whole floors of execution going on just like they
[41:48.120 --> 41:52.360]  have whole floors of saying it's the law when it's not the law all the nurses have to take all these
[41:52.360 --> 41:56.600]  vaccines now courts are really they're going to give kids shot without parental consent california
[41:56.600 --> 42:03.160]  passed the law it's happening okay it's happening right and they and they use poster child like oh

[42:10.760 --> 42:17.160]  someone who's brain dead to set the precedent while they're killing people now you remember
[42:18.200 --> 42:26.200]  to begin uh back in february paul watson got an email from a listener a tip this is how it works
[42:26.200 --> 42:34.840]  saying hey the the the i'm a doctor the prestigious medical ethics journal the journal medical ethics

[43:21.720 --> 43:29.000]  right into an incinerator they're gonna send you into the showers for de lousy i mean it's hygiene

[44:25.480 --> 44:29.400]  and they're going to be able to treat you in a hundred percent recovery but they're going to wink
[44:29.400 --> 44:33.480]  wink and the surgeon that's over you is going to be the head of the bioethics board in that
[44:34.760 --> 44:39.160]  that hospital and he's going to get probably a hundred thousand dollars or the four hundred five
[44:39.160 --> 44:44.040]  hundred thousand they're going to get out of your body my dad's worked in hospitals rewiring
[44:44.040 --> 44:48.760]  jaws you name it when i was going 15 to take my driver's test he said do not sign that organ
[44:48.760 --> 44:53.640]  donor card i've been told that if you go in hurt in a wreck even if you are operable
[44:53.640 --> 44:59.960]  and a hundred percent recoverable you'll be killed and i thought my dad was a crazy liar
[44:59.960 --> 45:04.680]  and then years later it came out on 60 minutes in the very city that i was from dallas they were
[45:04.680 --> 45:09.160]  killing people should come out in the news they kill people in the town i live in austin chicago is

[54:43.000 --> 54:47.800]  because the media is smart the globalist media they only cover some brain dead person being
[54:47.800 --> 54:53.000]  turned off and he's been on a coma for 20 years and and and you hear about families that keep
[54:53.000 --> 54:58.520]  their family alive or keep somebody alive and then it's made to look stupid even though my uncle
[54:59.160 --> 55:05.480]  was my dad's brother was in a very bad motorcycle accident was in a coma for six weeks
[55:06.440 --> 55:12.040]  they wanted to unplug him immediately he's got two healthy happy full grown children
[55:12.040 --> 55:19.640]  uh he uh has businesses he's very successful uh he has a little bit of a speech problem
[55:19.640 --> 55:26.040]  but he lives a very fulfilled life and he was 17 years old demanded a motorcycle raised his own
[55:26.040 --> 55:32.120]  money to get it over the objections of my grandfather got the motorcycle went off and
[55:32.120 --> 55:37.480]  bought it with my grandmother my grandfather you know it was so much excitement he said okay you
[55:37.480 --> 55:42.680]  can have the motorcycle a couple months later boom it's hit by a truck the point is they wanted to
[55:42.680 --> 55:52.600]  unplug him they wanted to take him off the feeding tube this is like a 1968 and my family said no
[55:52.600 --> 55:59.480]  and six weeks later came out of the coma so you have to balance all of this but there's no balance
[55:59.480 --> 56:05.080]  to this once you have socialist health care could you have socialist health care run by angels
[56:05.080 --> 56:13.400]  i mean hypothetically a giant spaceships landed run by some foreign robot race and said we are
[56:13.400 --> 56:19.800]  here to make you live forever we will give you life extension uh because you know we love your
[56:19.800 --> 56:25.480]  species this is hypothetical i'm not saying this is real for the media out there then i guess that's
[56:25.480 --> 56:31.000]  socialism something shows up and says it wants to give you something free let's see this this
[56:31.000 --> 56:36.520]  isn't some you know angel showing up to give you eternal life or or to give you free health care
[56:36.520 --> 56:42.760]  these are eugenicists for heaven's sakes read margaret singers letters type in margaret singers
[56:42.760 --> 56:49.880]  letters on african americans i say use that search term because that's what'll pull it up
[56:51.800 --> 56:56.840]  they're referred to as africans and they said we're going to pose as liberals we're going to
[56:56.840 --> 57:00.600]  take control these people institutionally we're going to kill them and they do they kill half of
[57:00.600 --> 57:08.440]  them 52 non-born from 10% of legitimacy to 92% of legitimacy they have destroyed the black community
[57:08.440 --> 57:13.240]  and let me tell you something they're going to do it to everybody's community in fact you look at
[57:13.240 --> 57:16.600]  every other community that's exactly what they've duplicated they started with the blacks because
[57:16.600 --> 57:21.000]  that was a group that they could target and isolate and control they said we're going to run the
[57:21.000 --> 57:26.120]  hookers and the drugs in your neighborhood and then that's going to be our only economic
[57:26.120 --> 57:34.120]  way to move up the globalists have it all figured out they're engineers and they hate humanity and
[57:34.120 --> 57:40.360]  now they are saying oh people are so infertile now the government will pay to have a designer
[57:40.360 --> 57:45.160]  baby for you even with three parents look this up but we're going to cut out any traits we say are
[57:45.160 --> 57:52.600]  bad including aggression including not trusting authority you can type in the news articles

[58:21.560 --> 58:26.360]  also seen children die in terrible thirst because fluids are withdrawn from them until they die

[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:32.040]  the globalist sell the general public on bioethics and to not get treatment in your life but here's
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:38.280]  the description to leslie smith's book that he's basically serialized in the wall street journal
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.360]  when his teenage son christopher brain damage in an auto accident developed a 106 degree fever
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:50.200]  following weeks of unconsciousness john cambell asked the attending physician for help the doctor
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:55.480]  refused why bother the boy's life was effectively over cambell refused to accept this verdict he
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:00.280]  demanded treatment and threatened legal action the doctor finally relented with treatment christopher
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:05.080]  temperatures subsided almost immediately soon afterwards he regained consciousness and today
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:11.320]  he is learning to walk again this story is one of many wesley j smith recounts in his groundbreaking
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:16.520]  new book culture of death it's been out for 10 years now smith believes that american medicine is
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:23.000]  changing from a system based on the sanctity of human life to a stark utilitarian model yes eugenics
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:29.640]  in which he medically defenseless our scene is having not just a right to die but a duty to die
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:35.240]  going behind the curtain of scenes of health care system he shows how doctors would draw
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:40.520]  desired care based on feudal care theory rather than providing it as required by the
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:48.040]  hypocritical well it's been removed and how bioethicistic influence policy by considering
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:53.800]  questions such as whether organs may be harvested from the terminally ill and disabled this is a
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:58.600]  passionate yet coolly reasoned book yeah and he doesn't even get into really eugenics i i'm i'm
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:04.600]  kind of the master researcher along with erin dykes on that it integrates in and and and we either
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:10.680]  understand folks they're now killing people who have become paralyzed they're saying well your
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:16.680]  quality of life's not too good paralyzed neck down we're going to kill you now if you're christopher

[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:26.040]  don't have money they're going to kill you through this government run health care system and that's
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:32.600]  what's so sick i'm not putting out rhetoric here to demonize obama care because i don't like obama
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:37.320]  and i don't like the free phone and i'm just mad because he's black and all this baloney
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:41.320]  and these people jumping up and down feeling like they've won because they're guys in
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:46.120]  mitt romney was bad too but obama was clearly worse that's why he was put in and the fact that
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:53.640]  they can say oh there's a mandate now for all this just shows how they sell this fraud i mean
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:58.920]  look at this article by wesley j smith in the weekly standard 2004 now they want to euthanize

[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:41.320]  i was there getting second place for a report on the patriot act uh withdrawing remaining
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:48.840]  uh rights from the bill of rights and she's in um our film marshal law 911 rise the police
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:54.600]  state she's been on the show i don't know 10 times or so over the years she is a former congresswoman
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:09:01.320]  sentia mckinney we played the clips here before but you know grilling rumsfeld about sex trafficking
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:07.880]  uh with the pentagon and defense contractors and dinecore and rumsfeld saying they're allowed
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:13.560]  to do that just type in uh congressional hearing on child sex trafficking and you'll you'll see it
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:20.360]  on youtube uh and boy they went after her after that happened democratic party as well and she
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:26.520]  goes to war zones to cover what's happening she has a lot of courage and uh you know this is
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.120]  what the democratic party in the past has claimed they're about fighting for the little guy but
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:35.480]  they're all bought and paid for by the same people as the republican leadership and i was driving
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:41.480]  along in the car listening on a local affiliate here in austin texas i think it was monday and i
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:46.600]  heard sentia mckinney on uh captain joce riley show here on the gcn radio network gcm live.com
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:50.600]  i thought man it's time to try to get her on uh because last time i tried to get her on she was
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:54.600]  out of the country you're doing reporting but she joins us for the rest of the hour then we've got
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:10:00.520]  some in studio guest uh joining us as well but you know she was talking about barack obama
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:06.040]  and why he's so dangerous because he makes people that are traditionally anti torture
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:12.760]  anti war anti police state just say hey i want india i want troops on the streets i want tsa
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:18.520]  sticking their hands down our pants i want banker bailouts because it's obama and we saw
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:23.400]  conservatives go to sleep uh under bush because well he's a republican we're winning it's the same
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:27.800]  thing when they're bought and paid for so i wanted her to flesh that out to talk about her trips to
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:33.400]  the middle east talk about her take on the ouster of a qaddafi and now in syria our government
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:41.400]  admitting they run al qaeda i wanted to get her take on on where she sees all this going and and
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:47.800]  where she sees the future of america because let me tell you something sentia mckinney has
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:57.240]  more courage than any man i know i mean i've been invited uh to iraq to cover things with
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:05.560]  with with the real press i've been invited to the west bank i've been invited uh to these places i've
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:12.920]  been invited uh you know to come be an observer by foreign governments an official letterhead
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:17.880]  i won't even get into that and and and it's not that i'm physically afraid it's that i'm comfortable
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:23.640]  here covering things doing things reaching millions a day now but i think that's a cop out um
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:30.120]  it's just that it's it's just like some of the other guests we have on who were in triply while
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:37.640]  it was under bombardment people like webster tarply people like uh wane madson and she just has
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:43.800]  incredible courage and and i know she's transformed too from 20 years ago you know kind of being more
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:49.240]  of a mainline democrat to her awakening through the system from the inside uh that's really what i
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:54.280]  admire above everything out there is people that really have courage and really tell it like it is
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:59.400]  now i'm gonna stop gushing for sentia mckinney that's why but she's been so demonized misrepresented
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:04.120]  in the press is because the system is scared of this woman and i guess you ought to counter lucky
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:08.280]  stars because they they used to just kill people like her now they just kill your character in the
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:14.280]  media assassinate your character uh but they sure tried to do that but i know the real sentia mckinney
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:19.400]  and we ought to do a special piece just on the wars she's been through sentia great to have
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:23.720]  you with us congresswoman a former congresswoman uh you know you've heard my little intro here i
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:30.360]  want to get into obama first because because he provides that illusion that's helping bring in this
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:38.120]  corporate world government right now you're absolutely right and i remember watching a clip
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:46.200]  of henry kissinger saying that it was amazing the amount of goodwill that candidate barack obama
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:58.200]  had and um it is absolutely true that around the world president barack obama still maintains
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:10.920]  goodwill even as he is torturing renditioning killing um spending our money on war and and
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:20.200]  even more war and it's just amazing the amount of goodwill and so what that really tells me
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:29.480]  is that people around the world were really waiting for us voters to step up to the plate and do the
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:38.680]  right thing and elect someone who first of all would stick to his word and keep campaign promises
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:47.080]  make a campaign that was really a campaign of or and by the people but then also elect someone who
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:56.600]  was capable of being a global citizen someone who felt responsibility for the impact of us policy in
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:05.720]  other places around the world sadly that is not the case with barack obama and the um talked about
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:16.760]  nomination of ambassador susan rice to the secretary of state position is just one more example of how
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:26.600]  the powers that be are able to take what ought to be something good and turn it into a travesty
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:35.640]  this woman sat on top of us regime change in rwanda that resulted in a million people being
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:42.920]  killed and this was a policy that she went along with and that state department random 200
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:48.200]  henry kissinger 1973 continuing we have that clip in a moment of of kissinger we're going to play
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:54.920]  that congresswoman but here's what's so incredible about this is that these facts are public that
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:15:01.480]  rwanda wasn't a disaster it was engineered all that's come out and it's part of the policy of
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:07.880]  killing africans deader than a hammer and it's so incredible that as long as it's the liberals
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:13.320]  doing it it's cute and funny here's henry kissinger right after obama was elected saying he's going
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:18.120]  to bring in the new world order here it is what do you think the most important thing is for barack
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.280]  obama obviously you're here to talk about the anniversary for us china diplomatic relations
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:26.680]  but if you had to say this is going to be the country or the conflict or the place that was
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:33.560]  behind the obama administration what would it be the president elect is coming into office at a
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:39.160]  moment when they are upheavals in many parts of the world simultaneously have india park is done
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:47.880]  you have uh... the uh... tree-hearted movement so he can't really say that it's one problem that
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:55.720]  it's the most important one but he can give new competitive to american foreign policy partly
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:03.400]  because the reception of him is so extraordinary around the world i think his task will be to
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:10.280]  develop an overall strategy for america in this period when really a new world order can be created
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:17.960]  it's a great opportunity it isn't that big crisis okay again that is on the stock market floor so
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:22.280]  it's and that's not the best version of it we actually have a clip of it in fall the republic
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:30.280]  uh... breaking all that down with henry kissinger but there it is and and it's just so incredible
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:36.920]  that people say oh you don't like obama because you're a racist and i'm like what are you talking
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:42.600]  about synthia mckinney what do you say to people that throw that around when people point out
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:50.280]  that obama is just the other side of the same globalist coin well unfortunately we still have
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:59.320]  a lot of people who uh buy into this kissingerian myth about the goodwill and i subscribe to the view
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:10.600]  of uh glenn ford of black agenda report who says that president obama is the more effective evil
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:18.440]  not the lesser of two evils or the lesser evil but he's the more effective evil and why is that
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:29.160]  because he is allowed to do the things that bill clinton even or especially george w bush would not
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:34.280]  be allowed to do he's allowed to do the things that romney couldn't even think about doing
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:43.560]  and so now for example the tabling of the idea of 400 billion dollar cuts in the social safety net
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:52.280]  this is outrageous when there's no talk at all about trimming the pentagon and cutting out
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:18:01.720]  all of these wars literally as we speak right now the united states is bombing samalia there's no
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:07.960]  need for all of this african is invading everything as we said in the obama deception now four years
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:14.600]  ago all of this is coming out and what about libya where they put al qaeda in they actually engage
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:19.720]  in ethnic cleansing of real africans people that belong there and then now they're using the same
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:27.640]  al qaeda against syria it's incredible yes that's exactly what is happening and i think um the
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:36.840]  government of syria announced that they had um the bodies of over 150 foreign fighters and we know
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:45.160]  that people from libya have with their weapons gone into syria it's just a tragedy all around this is a
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:56.440]  man-made tragedy as a human uh made tragedy and it is something that if we exercise our political
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:06.360]  rights and and stretch our political muscle we can stop it but i just am so um at this point not um
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:14.360]  confused but just disappointed in the lack of outrage at the things that are happening and that
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:21.080]  our president and the congress can get away with well it's like the bottom dropped out the government
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:26.200]  openly arms al qaeda to take over two countries they use al qaeda to attack inside iran staging
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:30.600]  terror attacks while saying give our rights up because of al qaeda the government runs giant
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:36.440]  white slavery rings people always email me saying white people know it means sex slavery folks i mean
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:42.600]  which you've been a champion against i want to get into that it's so crazy and then i had a young
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:48.680]  woman cutting my hair this weekend and and and she was sitting there saying uh yeah i want to join
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:54.200]  the un to fight sex trafficking and it's the un running it i mean it's just the level of ignorance
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:58.440]  like the bottom's falling out former congresswoman sythia mckinney's our guest we've got it for the
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:05.160]  rest of the hour stay with us we have witnessed two terrible storms in the east but we are still

[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:26.120]  crisis then the three-day supply at your local grocery store will be gobbled up by the mob in

[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:21.320]  the gcm radio network by the way ladies and gentlemen just as i began to think here would have
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:27.320]  him sit the mckinney on and why i'm saying he's just such a champion if you type in mckinney grills
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:34.680]  rumsfeld you'll find a clip we grabbed off c-span uh i don't know was it back in 2007 or so and then
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:40.840]  youtube kept pulling it down but people made copies of it uh and it's mckinney grills rumsfeld
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:45.640]  and in nine minutes she brings up the child kidnapping rings and stuff and rumsfeld says well
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:51.480]  dinecours just allowed to do that i mean that's what's incredible about this i'm going to play
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:58.360]  that later but while she was talking it was democratic uh operatives that basically helped
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:02.600]  push her out of the congress i mean they have gone after her like nothing i've ever seen
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:09.080]  and hank johnson's the guy that says islands capsize that's the guy they put in a new article at
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:14.760]  prisonplanet dot com and info wars dot com and it's got the clips of him talking democratic rep
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:21.160]  wants to amend constitution to deny free speech curt nemo uh so so literally i wasn't going to bring
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:27.000]  up this guy who they used to get her out of congress that says islands capsize they're floating
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.360]  you understand according to him that's who the globalist found to get rid of this incredibly
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:36.760]  smart lady smart as they come they they put this this guy in who now is calling to restrict free
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:43.080]  speech i mean he literally is like a cartoon character uh synthia i think it's time for you
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:54.200]  to run for congress again well you know i i get i get that and and i this last little thing that you
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:26:02.680]  you make me speechless all the time and no one is ever able to do that um but i you know yes
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:10.440]  i'm working on my phd right now and when i finish um i think i might just do that because uh and
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:18.040]  actually i'll be finished very soon so so uh just in time for 2014 uh conveniently enough tell us
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:22.040]  about this guy that the neocons got behind a run against you because you kept exposing him
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:29.960]  well the the only thing i can say is that it's really pathetic you know um the people of the
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:37.160]  fourth district have not been served at all since i left and um we've got these outrageous statements
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:43.160]  that have been made but when i say not served at all i mean people don't even see him and maybe
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:52.920]  that's a good thing because then uh they are not reminded of uh the the uh complete um you know
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:27:01.240]  person that they have there who really is not the brightest uh poll on the on the block but
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:06.840]  what he was bright enough to do was to say yes when the democrats approached him apparently
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:14.440]  it was uh ron emmanuel who did so and um gave him the deal and then he came to me and said well
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:20.120]  you know it's uh it's just business it's nothing personal yeah well let's play the guy that thinks
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:24.440]  islands are floating and he said this wasn't a joke uh here is the gentleman now saying get rid
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:40.520]  of our free speech here it is this is a uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh oh no um hey guys guys guys that's
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:47.080]  not a serious clip hit pause hit pause we're gonna have to get the long one find the spot where he
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:51.800]  says the island's floating because or or the computer's messing up we've got a that clip's
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.320]  been saved many times so we want to get a proper clip during the break and we'll play everybody
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:28:00.520]  knows about him saying that you know islands could capsize we put too many military bases on it
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:05.160]  uh and i think the computer was having a problem there but uh uh sent the i mean it's just incredible
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:10.920]  the links they go to to go after you well it was both the democrats and the republicans and it was
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:19.320]  also the pro-israel lobby of course no one wants to talk about but when we have operation pillar of
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:27.640]  cloud being supported by 535 members of congress as we just saw the most recent israeli bombardment
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:34.920]  of gaza and i was prepared to go back to gaza as well but um they had the ceasefire and so then
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:43.320]  of course there was uh no need to go uh in underneath the bombing but um i was told by
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:51.080]  people in gaza that it was a 24 hour around the clock bombardment and uh there really wasn't
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:59.080]  very much left to bomb except the people from uh operation cast lead so now what is this all leading

[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:38.200]  taken out of context giant media operations against her we're going to play a clip of why
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:44.120]  coming up when she exposed rumsfeld there's like an hour of it but other short clips online
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:49.000]  mckinney grills rumsfeld where they admit dinecore was running giant child kidnapping rings that's
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:54.680]  who runs the major cps contracting here in the u.s. are the biggest single contractor as well
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:34:01.960]  and they were putting the penalty box on bosnian contracts for one year that was their
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:07.080]  punishment and they had the director of the pentagon budget office dr chew explained it all
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:13.800]  and and they they are scared of her and i'm telling you she's got angels around her she'd be dead
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:18.920]  and she's here with us now but we were having a computer glitch earlier that's why it was
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:24.600]  repeating the clip that happens sometimes every once in a while uh cruise doing a great job here
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:28.760]  is that clip of that congressperson before we go back to her that replaced her that they
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:34.120]  that the democrats ran against her not republicans have run people against ron paul in his own
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:38.920]  district democrats hate the idea of the first amendment does not explicitly restrict the
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:43.320]  right of corporations to free speech in other words to address this perceived flaw representative
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:49.000]  hank johnson towards democrat has proposed amending the constitution we need a constitutional amendment
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:53.240]  to allow the legislature to control the so-called free speech rights of corporations but that would
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:35:01.400]  then lead on to individuals and it breaks all of that down this guy's a total puppet anything
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:05.880]  he's pushing you know is bad let's play that clip of him saying islands are floating here it is
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:18.760]  well this is a uh island that at its widest level is what 12 miles from shore to shore
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:33.960]  and at a smallest level uh or smallest uh uh location it's uh seven miles uh between one
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:41.400]  shore and the other is that correct i don't have the exact uh dimensions but uh to your point sir
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:51.800]  i think guam is a small island very small island and about 24 miles if i recall long so 24 miles
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:36:03.000]  long about seven miles wide at the least widest uh place on the island and about 20 about 12
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:14.840]  miles wide uh on the widest part of the island and um i don't know how many square miles that
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:21.240]  that is do you happen to know i don't have that figure with me sir i can certainly supply it to
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:31.480]  you if you'd like yeah my my fear is that uh the whole island will uh become so overly populated
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:43.000]  that it will tip over and uh and capsize uh we don't anticipate that the uh the guam population
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:48.200]  i think currently about 175 000 and again with eight thousand that's enough he goes on to talk more
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:52.120]  about capsizing and congresswoman i apologize for even going back to that clip i just want to point
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:58.200]  out this is who the democrats wanted to replace you with because you've been critical of uh some
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:03.160]  of the things the israelis are doing uh and and ron paul is farewell address you know he said
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:09.560]  why is apac why will no one be able to criticize apac or they come after you i mean i've not even
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:15.400]  been overly critical of israel and i've had apac lobby come after me i mean i mean you've got a
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:23.640]  really you know just tell the line or they come after you yes it's true and um actually in my
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:32.200]  uh schoolwork which is uh the phd is in leadership and change um and clearly our country needs both
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:42.600]  but um i'm focusing on targeted assassination and i'm going back to the most um uh complete
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:49.640]  and thorough documentation that we have of this particular phenomenon or policy rather
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:55.720]  and that is during the co entail pro the days of the counterintelligence program now what makes this
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:04.360]  an important issue for us to understand thoroughly is that now today we have a president who's saying
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:14.360]  that who is claiming the right of targeted assassination not just of foreign enemies but of
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:25.960]  us citizens on us soil this is such a grand leap into the stratosphere or some of us would say the
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:34.280]  twilight zone that um we have got to understand if we're going to dissent we've got to really
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:43.320]  understand the ways in which now this playing field has been substantively changed by legislation
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:51.000]  and by um the policies and practices that allow the this kind of a thing of targeted assassination
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:59.160]  to take place with impunity well take the ndaa now they want to expand it uh to allow full
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:04.920]  military operation not just have the military disappear us and now the new army manual that
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:10.520]  can pull the number up for listeners uh says re education camps that they'll put political
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:15.720]  dissidents quote in re education camps they're even using the authoritarian name Cynthia and
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:21.400]  against former congresswoman Cynthia McKinney you better call me Cynthia but i mean it's amazing
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:30.600]  that it's like open authoritarianism absolutely and but you see these were actually these are
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:38.040]  plans that were drawn up uh back during the time of the sixties and that's why the church committee
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:47.080]  reports are invaluable for not only academicians and you know historians but also invaluable
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:56.040]  for people who want to dissent and to lead change today because operation chaos operation garden
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:03.800]  plot these are all and you know if i were to say the things that are written in these documents
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:10.520]  people would say oh she's this she's that you know call me all kinds of uh denigrating names
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:18.440]  but it's there and it's online and it's under the church committee reports it's declassified
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:26.040]  tell people some of the stuff that's in there well um they they go into great lengths they do
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:36.200]  and in fact they do a case study on uh the targeting of dr martin luther king jr and they did everything
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:49.960]  from um the media which they said that um uh the the united states c i a had relationships
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:59.000]  and imagine that in the era of pentagon perception management that this is even multiplied now
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:08.760]  but that they had relationships with publishing houses journalists out entire uh media organs
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:19.400]  um foundations um operation mockingbird and in fact um every aspect of life
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:27.880]  they say in the church committee reports that thousands of of academicians thousands of professors
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:38.120]  were on the cia payroll one way or the other they um were actively on the payroll or they
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:44.520]  had projects that were financed and now it's literally no exaggeration 20 30 times worse
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:48.040]  jessie ventura his first week as governor they said we want to call you down at the bottom of
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:52.920]  the capital and there was 23 cia people there basically telling him we're watching you here
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:57.240]  locally and he said well it's illegal for for you to be operating domestically and now tens of
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:03.400]  billions a year are spent in messages in tv in the sitcoms and dramas and what are they
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:10.600]  anti-family anti-freedom anti-gun all of this we are being bombarded with just absolute
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:19.240]  destructive messages here that's right in in in 19 in the 1999 trial that was conducted by
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:28.600]  william pepper who represented the king family there was um uh expert testimony given that said
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:36.920]  that approximately 30 percent of the cia budget at that time was in this idea of you know the
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:46.360]  grand warlets are um shaping public opinion imagine what it is now imagine so here we have
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:53.640]  the penetration of intelligence and this is all cataloged in the church committee reports from
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:43:03.960]  churches domestically as well as international universities foundations media and publishing
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:13.720]  houses every aspect of our life had been penetrated one way or another by the intelligence services
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:21.240]  of the united states and this is back in the 1970s now of course that's well back then
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:29.560]  frank church senator church who led one part of the investigation in odys pike led another
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:36.360]  part of the investigation on the house side said frank church said that these activities
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:43.880]  that ranged from targeted assassination through neutralization of people who dissent
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:51.400]  like members of american indian movement members of the black panther party members of the port
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:56.920]  of rica independence movement which is the three organizations that i'm writing about right now
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:44:05.560]  now and right through to the kinds of jerry rubin wrote an open letter that they went through his
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:15.000]  bank account they knew they knew how much he made every time he took to the stage and made a speech
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:23.080]  they knew everything about jerry rubin and at that time it was illegal and unamerican according
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:28.920]  to senator church and now it is many times worse but here is the silver lining people in the fbi
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:34.920]  people in the cia that was mainly race-based then and it still is some to a certain extent today
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:39.800]  but now it's purely cold-blooded globalist corporate banking cartel that took over with
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:45.560]  the federal reserve but now is fully dissolved in the us people inside the police the military
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:50.440]  in other areas because i talked to them but we're seeing the evidence they are now demoralized but
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:56.200]  not in a bad way they now get it because of countless people's work like myself you ron paul
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:45:01.400]  and others and they understand they're not buying the old stories of why they tell them to go out
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:06.920]  and do evil stuff they now we're getting this so i think that's really the battle is over the heart
[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:12.600]  and soul because now congress is doing whatever they're told they're following nato you know being
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:18.040]  told nato gives our military orders so now it's gotten so bad i mean i'm starting to see a real
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:23.640]  awakening are you saying that i absolutely am and that's why i've been working really hard and i
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:29.640]  think i'm i i think i'm seeing the dividends of this work but i've been reaching out because
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:37.240]  at some point at one point it became clear to me that it's not black or white it's not a racial
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:45.880]  thing anymore um they were just practicing on us and now they've expanded to the larger community
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:52.280]  and so the old paradigms the old political paradigm left right you know communists or
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:46:03.000]  whatever all of that um is no longer relevant it's wrong versus right yep that's it that's right
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:08.360]  it's tyranny versus liberty and both parties are bought and paid for by the same foreign banks
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:15.080]  and they brag in the news they've conquered us that's why i've been reaching out to oath keepers
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:20.920]  and um i've reached out to this young man we've been trying we've been trying to connect uh dan
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:26.760]  johnson who is leader of these individuals who have decided that they're going to draw a line in
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:37.000]  the sand on ndaa and what i want to do is i want to partner with all of the people of this country
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:44.040]  who want to draw a line in the sand i'm ready it is coming down to that when they say yeah we'll
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:47.640]  torture you yeah we're spying on you without warrants yeah we're going to take your pension
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:52.200]  funds and give it in a bank or bailout uh it it is so cold blooded now i want to get into white
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:57.240]  slavery rings that means sex trafficking for new listeners out there and what you have exposed
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:02.280]  the un estimates that in just the last decade over two million people were trafficked out of europe
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:08.360]  alone millions out of the middle east africa this is a giant industry and who runs at the big
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:13.000]  defense contractors i want to play just a few minutes of you talking right to donald rumsfeld
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  and the pentagon brass in front of you talk about talk about guts here's a short clip of that
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:26.200]  of of a congresswoman syntium mckinney talking to folks it's not ready we called for the start
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:33.720]  of the last hour uh i mean we got it queued up start telling folks start telling folks about
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:40.680]  that and then we'll play the clip well um i would also just like to mention there's a there's another
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:48.600]  clip of me um with uh churtoff and churtoff is every time i'm going to the airport today
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:54.760]  and every time you go through an airport you know i think about the churtoff machines that make him
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:48:03.640]  very wealthy um so this idea of us challenging like the young people of we are change and like
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:09.640]  luke ripkowski i mean there are some young people who have decided that they're just going to put
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:14.600]  they're going to do what mario savio said and that is put their entire bodies against the
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:19.960]  gears and the levers and the wheels of the machine and they're saying to the owners you know if you
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:25.400]  don't stop it we're going to stop it which is really beautiful you're right there is an awakening
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:30.360]  and i'm just happy to be able to see this awakening now but i want to see more as well
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.960]  wow yeah we do have that clip actually queued up and again if anybody wants to watch it in full
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:43.560]  just type in synthia mckinney grills donnell rumsfeld uh here is uh that clip of her in congress
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:55.720]  what year was this when you did this uh that was 2006 2006 and uh here's just part of it here's part
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:49:03.800]  of that uh hearing i think the gentleman the gentle lady from georgia miss mckinney oh thank you
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:13.240]  mr chairman mr secretary i watched president bush deliver a moving speech at the united
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:21.000]  nations in september 2003 in which he mentioned he mentioned the crisis of the sex trade the president
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:26.360]  called for the punishment of those involved in this horrible business but at the very moment of
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:32.920]  that speech dinecore was exposed for having been involved in the buying and selling of young women
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:39.480]  and children while all of this was going on dinecore kept the pentagon contract to administer the
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:45.960]  smallpots nantrax vaccines and is now working on a plague vaccine through the joint vaccine
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:52.360]  acquisition program mr secretary is it policy of the u.s government to reward companies that
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:58.360]  traffic and women and little girls that's my first question my second question mr secretary
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:03.800]  according to the controller general of the united states there are serious financial
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:11.160]  management problems at the pentagon to which mr cooper alluded fiscal year 1999 2.3 trillion missing
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:19.400]  fiscal year 2001.1 trillion missing and do d is the number one reason why the government can't
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:25.480]  balance his checkbook the pentagon is claimed year after year that the reason it can't account for the
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:31.640]  money is because its computers don't communicate with each other my second question mr secretary
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:38.040]  is who has the contracts today to make those systems communicate with each other how long
[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:45.160]  have they had those contracts and how much have the taxpayers paid for them finally mr secretary
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:51.320]  after the last hearing i thought that my office was promised a written response to my question
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:57.960]  regarding the four war games on september 11th i have not yet received that response but would
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:03.560]  like for you to respond to the questions that i've put to you today and then i do expect the written
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:11.960]  response to my previous question hopefully by the end of the week um thank you uh representative
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:18.600]  the first the answer to your first question is is no absolutely not the policy of the united
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:27.400]  states government is uh clear unambiguous and opposed to uh to the activities that you described
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:36.200]  the um second question well how do you explain the fact that um dinecore and its successor
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:44.520]  companies have received and continue to receive government contracts i would have to go and and
[01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:50.360]  find the facts but there are laws and rules and regulations with respect to government contracts
[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:55.640]  and there are times that corporations do things they should not do in which case they tend to
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:52:00.840]  be suspended for some period there are times then that that the under the laws and the rules
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:06.040]  and regulations for the that passed by the congress and implemented by the executive branch
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:13.160]  that corporations can get off of the pen out of the penalty box if you will and and be permitted to
[01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:19.320]  do engage in contracts with the government they're they're not generally not barred in perpetuity
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:25.240]  this contract this company um was never in the penalty box if you could proceed to my second
[01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:37.080]  question please the um the second question uh i've forgotten what the second question was
[01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:43.080]  i think miss jonas knows it okay that's enough again there's hours of this but that's why they
[01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:47.720]  hate her that's 2006 that's why they've gone after we've got 10 minutes left here a little
[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:52.920]  bit less uh former congresswoman set the mechanic i think you need to be back in congress obviously
[01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:58.280]  and i and i hope you do run again and i hope the electronic voting machines um don't keep you out
[01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:03.160]  because i mean you've got to be able to be the guy that says islands are floating around and uh
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:08.520]  everything else but i mean again they always talk about women being grabbed if you go read the actual
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:15.960]  reports as you know this sex slavery is little kids some of them in snuff films shadi arabia israel
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:22.680]  uh a bunch of other asian countries that's where these kids are going and it's just left alone
[01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:28.680]  and there's even pbs documentaries and then it's this cause celeb to talk about sex slavery
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:33.160]  but they're always busting some low-level pimp that's running a few prostitutes you know that's
[01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:38.840]  bad enough but they're never talking about the real deal the real i mean i could pull up un
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:44.120]  murdering children and show photos right now i don't want to show it on tv but uh go ahead congresswoman
[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:52.840]  well i was just gonna say that you're absolutely right and if you recall there was the um the uh
[01:53:52.840 --> 01:54:01.400]  scandal really in Haiti of missionaries that were taking uh young Haitian kids and they
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:06.760]  in the Haitian government caught them before they were able to escape over into the dominican
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:16.040]  republic but um we've had a situation that was actually adjudicated in the courts um with another
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:24.120]  situation of a Haitian of a you know gentleman well not really a gentleman but a a person going
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:30.520]  down to Haiti and stealing kids and bringing them back up to the united states so this is really
[01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:36.440]  a problem and you're right it's a it's an international problem and our our government
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:44.120]  ought to really stand up against it well i'm just speechless listening to you um
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:48.920]  and it's amazing how they'll take the crimes they're committing and then they'll create the
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:54.680]  opposition to the sex slavery and then they'll lead it so they can control the debate and white
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:55:01.400]  wash it absolutely and i guess you call that controlled opposition and what we have to be
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:08.600]  able to do those of us who uh view ourselves on the outside of the political system and are trying
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:15.240]  to impact it what we have to be able to do is to identify the gatekeepers identify the controlled
[01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:24.600]  opposition and identify those who who have a kind of spirit and a kind of heart that will um allow us
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:30.680]  to penetrate all of the obstacles that are put forth that are put forward against us and it is
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:37.960]  possible for us to do that i remember a quote from uh bobby kennedy who said that a million
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:47.480]  uh ripples uh joined together can wash down the mightiest uh walls of oppression and i believe
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:54.200]  that i agree with you look it's simple in history and i know you're very well read and studied and
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:59.800]  and and have lived a lot as well but when you give into corruption the corrupt don't understand if
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:03.720]  they're just stealing money or they're just you know doing something that's seen as mid-level
[01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:09.400]  that then they can't say no to the next corrupt person who's a little more corrupt than them
[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:14.680]  and then it's a little more corrupt and a little more corrupt and pretty soon the un is delivering
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:21.080]  kids three-year-old toddlers to a snuff film production company in italy where they rape them
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:25.640]  and blow their heads off i mean and and that's a real case i just mentioned that came out on
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:31.080]  italian television and they fired the italian producers even though it was confirmed because
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:37.800]  the snuff films were meant for distribution in california wow i mean folks for cia fbi all of
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:42.840]  you on your petty power trips all of you that buy your propaganda you're signed on to a global
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:49.400]  corporate combine that blows the heads off of three-year-olds okay i mean you know that smart
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:56.360]  bombs whole families to kill one guy we have signed on to evil collectively and we've got to say whoa
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:02.360]  put the brakes on no more and that's what's so sick about obama is the obama supporters get this
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:07.480]  crazy look in their eye and go you're just racist you're just maddy one i'm like romney's bad too
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:12.840]  but obama is the more effective evil don't you get it's all manufactured and they just smile at me
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:18.360]  and say shut up racist and i'm just like no no no no no no don't you understand they just i can't
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:25.000]  get through to people i just i they just won't listen it it it is all manufactured and that's
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:31.080]  why people couldn't believe when when they would ask me you know you know what as if i was a part of
[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:36.920]  this great spectator sport you know you pull in for you know romney don't i know you really want
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:44.840]  obama to win but the bottom line is that the drones are flying no matter who won the bombs are dropping
[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:52.760]  no matter who won and the policy will continue until we the people and this is what i keep saying
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:58:02.520]  over and over again and that's why i want so much to redraw the political boundaries we have to join
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:13.080]  together uh washing down all of those expected divisions so for example when i came back from
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:20.120]  cake town south africa and had this so-called uh fba threat against me i tell you what can you do five

[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:21.560]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:33.320]  final segment with congresswoman sentient mckinney right now you have gone to these war zones to
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:37.720]  really see firsthand what's happening and you were getting into how the system tries to imply
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:43.720]  that you're somehow a bad person now they're having no fly list no gun buy list outside of law
[02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:48.760]  please continue you know for the five minutes we've got okay i'll just make it brief and i can
[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:58.040]  conclude in one one sentence basically and say that it really is time for us to come together
[02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:06.760]  and say no to the tyranny that is about to engulf all of us and so it doesn't really matter our
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:13.400]  gender our color our ethnicity our religion our accent i speak with a southern accent
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:20.200]  and none of that matters anymore it all depends now on whether or not we believe in freedom and
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:26.840]  liberty we believe in the bill of rights the u.s constitution or we're going to be run over by
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:31.240]  the people who don't but i want to get back to the harassment you've gone under for going to foreign
[02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:40.280]  countries oh i oh the harassment oh yes um i got an fbi a call when i came back from um
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:48.040]  cape town south africa is a part of the birch and russell tribunal on palestine and um i came back
[02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:55.640]  and um basically the fbi called and said that i had a terrorist threat that had been delivered
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:02:03.960]  against me eric holder and president obama and it was delivered by some georgia hillbillies
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:11.800]  and those people aren't concerned about me but you see it was all to to you know and they
[02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:19.480]  blew it up really big um but that's just to create more strife i know that those people in north georgia
[02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:26.200]  weren't concerned about me and in fact if i were to query them they are concerned about the same
[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:31.880]  things i'm concerned about which is those people who were making the call to me say offering their
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:39.800]  protection i feel more i feel safer with the people that i uh did with uh fbi offer of protection
[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:45.640]  that's for sure so you're saying it was the way to threaten you absolutely and of course um there's
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:53.640]  uh uh soft repression uh one of the aspects of what i'm studying now is repression and the tools
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:59.080]  that are used by government yeah they call it security but you're really in a prison uh
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:04.840]  let's expand on this what is the best website for people to visit and and find your information
[02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:11.960]  oh my goodness people tell me all the time they can go to all things synthia mckinney.com
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:19.560]  and there is not the best website i apologize um but if you hit the top back and send a message
[02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:25.880]  directly to me then i will answer i answer all of the messages that come to me so i encourage
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:30.920]  people to communicate with me sure well they use the name of security and safety and public safety
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:35.880]  as a prison that's how the chinese emperors got walled off and the women's feet were bound and
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:41.000]  they couldn't cut their fingernails because you're such a god you can't feed yourself or walk and
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:46.040]  that's how the priest class took over and became the real emperors and it's the same thing the tsa
[02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:52.920]  what's your take on the tsa uh it's a bunch of bunk and um i mean you know if you look at look at
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:04:01.160]  the business of the tsa first of all all of those machines i opt out all of the time and we did get
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:08.680]  a um uh modest victory with the you know saying okay we can film because that was your initiative i
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:16.440]  believe opt out and film and i always opt out every morning i wake up i ask myself what can i do to
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:22.760]  resist today and when i'm traveling i opt out that's one of the little you know grains of sand
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:28.120]  that i can put the little friction that i can call exactly tsa is literal slave training
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:35.160]  but and also absolutely and also the other thing is the responsibility of government um to tell us
[02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:41.560]  what's going on with fukushima we've got something going on at san or no fray uh nuclear power plant
[02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:48.120]  out in california what is it what's going on with the nuclear plant in uh new jersey there's so much
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:53.160]  there's so many issues out there everything's degenerating will you promise to come back soon
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:58.120]  and we'll talk about that yes i will wow what an amazing lady thank you so much i'll say bye to
[02:04:58.120 --> 02:05:06.040]  you during the break yes coming in studio sodium fluoride in the body reduces iq and increases
[02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:12.840]  cancers unfortunately fluoride and its derivatives are only one of hundreds of toxins being added

[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:08.600]  information is off the charts we sell these at cost because this is an outreach uh system and on the
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:14.200]  cover it shows obama sitting on top of american flag uh and it says this man wants your guns and it
[02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:18.680]  gets into just so many subjects and boy you can tell i've had four issues the first issue
[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:25.320]  sold out in two days and the ones that we held back the 40 000 or so because i put out 60 000 on
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:33.560]  the street then and held back 40 000 it's sold out in in two days less than two days uh 30 something
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:40.680]  thousand we held back some for subscriptions obviously this one sold out in less than a day
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:46.920]  and so we hadn't trucked because he just came in uh wednesday night they came in on the truck from
[02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:50.360]  the big printer we get these printed in ohio it was the best paper and the best deal we could find
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:59.960]  so we truck it in and um the the magazines came in and we were going to put 70 000 on the street
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:07.320]  we're putting 60 000 on the street because these things sold out so i just pulled back 10 000 more
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:11.000]  that we won't be putting on the street so you can get them people are buying them in bulk in groups
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:15.880]  of 10 up to 100 because it covers the attack on the second amendment it covers states rights it has
[02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:22.200]  ron paul's entire entire farewell address exposing the globalists that's so powerful the text of that
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:29.320]  with a full color poster in there and that's the issue is wow the first issue sold out because it
[02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:34.040]  was all about economic collapse by design the other two didn't sell out we still have some of
[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:38.120]  those left and this one sold out even quicker so it kind of gives you a gauge of what people are
[02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:42.600]  concerned about uh but this man wants your guns this is a great way to wake people up give a gift

[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:15.240]  can give to people with short attention spans with cartoons and graphics to wake them up

[02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:49.960]  of radio so going into the third hour here i'm plugging some stuff we've also got pro pure water
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:54.360]  filters 15 percent off running that till december 15 the gravity fed filters i use nobody's got
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:59.640]  a deal like that infowarstore.com we're not like the government that takes your money and then uses
[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:04.360]  it against you in propaganda forcibly with taxes we're like hey we got great books videos things
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:09.000]  we like and with the pro pure we do make money off that that's the kind of stuff that funds us
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:15.480]  and then we also again sell nullification the rifle remedy okay enough of me uh ranting and raving
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:24.040]  here today uh jason rink is one of the filmmakers who help make the documentary film nullification
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:29.240]  and you know i called two weeks ago i mean international headlines i called two weeks ago
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:36.600]  for the states to secede but not to secede to create a new confederacy or something else
[02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:41.000]  to secede from the new world order occupied federal government where they the foreign banks
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:44.440]  brag to shareholders they've conquered us and say there's no way we're going to take the whole
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:49.320]  economy we're only going to grow we're going to take everything they got jen 21 show goldman's
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:54.840]  act jb morgan brag about that we i'm saying go through the state legislatures whatever you want
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:59.880]  also fight in congress at that level from every level to to to restore the republic by the states
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:04.120]  pointing out the federal government's now out of control and illegitimate when that when the tsa
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:08.920]  tells the congress they're not under their oversight when when when congress is told three
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:12.760]  separate hearings by the joint chiefs and the chairman that nato commands our military now
[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:16.760]  and then we don't have to go to congress that's an illegitimate federal government right there
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:23.640]  and so that's my basic idea that lou rockwell's agreed with edwin viera uh ron paul one of ron paul's
[02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:29.640]  chief advisors uh as well as uh bruce fine constitutional lawyer so we now need to get
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:34.600]  this rolling it's not my idea i'm simply going hey this says make whatever government we want
[02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:38.840]  well we make america back when we reupload bill of rights constitution declaration of independence
[02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:43.480]  and we have the states do it and and just the focus of that in the media will bring the globalist
[02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:47.560]  to their knees and nullification shows the different remedies as well
[02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:53.480]  along those lines so joining us uh here in studio is jason rink and tom woods libertarian bestselling
[02:15:53.480 --> 02:16:00.600]  author also advisor ron paul joins us and we're very very excited tom woods dot com is the site
[02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:06.440]  there in nullification available at info or store dot com again evil free market evil free association
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:10.520]  oh it's so dirty and uh but taking your money at gunpoint and using it against you that's that's
[02:16:10.520 --> 02:16:14.920]  loving and moral jason rink dot com jason rink we're only got like three or four months we're
[02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:19.800]  going to break and we're with you guys for the rest of the hour but uh what do you think of of
[02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:24.440]  what i've said what do you think of the state of the republic and where it's going has the choices
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:27.800]  between tyranny and liberty ever been clear that we're going to go to break and come back and give
[02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:32.280]  tom woods the floor for that segment jason good to have you here with us oh glad to be here and
[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:37.080]  you know all we're really saying is this radical idea that maybe the founding fathers didn't fight
[02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:42.600]  a revolution write a constitution uh enumerate certain powers and then hand that document over
[02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:47.800]  to the federal government say okay now go limit limit yourself the states no longer have any say
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:53.640]  into uh whether or not the federal government has expanded past those enumerated powers and
[02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:59.400]  you know the tenth amendment was put in the constitution for a reason which said you can go
[02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:05.800]  this far and no further and so i think the the the notion that this is a radical idea
[02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:12.120]  that the states can stand up and be this check on federal power even when the supreme court
[02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:18.440]  decides and says oh obama care is constitutional even when the supreme court says states can't
[02:17:18.440 --> 02:17:25.560]  pass medical marijuana laws in opposition to uh you know federal unconstitutional war on drugs
[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:30.680]  you know this is what's happening and we're really seeing a watershed happening across the country
[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:36.920]  you know with these secession uh talks and people really saying look what do we do we we don't have
[02:17:36.920 --> 02:17:42.520]  any way to petition our federal government anymore we've got to look to the states and to the people
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:48.520]  to preserve liberty that's it and or why even have states why even have families why i mean the
[02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:54.440]  government is not god tom woods we're going to break here in a moment but but for a few minutes
[02:17:54.440 --> 02:18:00.200]  here lay out your your view i haven't asked you yet if you saw the reports i put out that gained
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:05.320]  so much traction ron paul's responded saying there's nothing more you know american then's the session
[02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:10.440]  what's your take on my basic cry that we need to get serious about this just to start the real
[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:14.200]  negotiation with the foreign banks that have hijacked the country because they've fully
[02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:18.440]  taken over washington we need to use the states as the check they were designed to be right now
[02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:23.080]  well i agree with your point that what's the point of having states if they don't do anything if they're
[02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:27.960]  they're not meant to be uh to exist for the administrative convenience of the central government
[02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:32.360]  the states created the central government now i don't know if i necessarily want to run through
[02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:36.840]  the same steps that got us back to got us where we are now i mean obviously there was a problem
[02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:40.760]  with the constitution or we wouldn't be in this situation and people may say well that's because
[02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:45.160]  they're not interpreting the constitution correctly well obviously there aren't strong enough safeguards
[02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:50.840]  against that or we wouldn't be in this situation and that's what thomas jefferson said that's exactly
[02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:56.760]  he said you you have to allow the states to to have some voice in deciding what's constitutional
[02:18:56.760 --> 02:19:01.320]  and that's that's a big no no you're not going to be taught that in american school but
[02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:05.400]  if you don't understand that point the federal government is just going to keep interpreting
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:10.280]  the constitution in these more and more bizarre ways to justify itself so i say the more we can
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:16.280]  talk about forbidden topics like nullification and secession and break through this philosophical
[02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:21.960]  barrier the better you're absolutely right and when we come back i want to look at the
[02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:25.640]  constitution bill of rights with both you gentlemen break down what's in the film nullification
[02:19:25.640 --> 02:19:30.680]  the rightful remedy because again we're not even talking about secession from the federal government
[02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:34.920]  i mean it's it's it's it's it's run by the private federal reserve for all intensive purposes
[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:40.520]  they admit that on cnbc so i mean i think we should hammer that as ron paul did his federal
[02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:46.360]  address i want to get both your take on that as well uh coming up we'll look at obama care and
[02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:52.040]  so much more the film with so many amazing speakers the nullification the rightful remedy
[02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:56.600]  the documentary film this is something every state representative every member of congress sees

[02:23:10.120 --> 02:23:14.200]  the liberal media has been suppressing what has fast become in the most shocking news story of

[02:23:32.440 --> 02:23:38.520]  exposed 123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt
[02:23:38.520 --> 02:23:45.240]  electricity monopoly the video at exposed 123.com has already been banned by google and the liberal
[02:23:45.240 --> 02:23:50.360]  media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep america in the dark so watch it
[02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:56.840]  now at exposed 123.com before it's too late again that's exposed 123.com
[02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:14.440]  before you slip into unconsciousness i like to have another kiss
[02:24:14.440 --> 02:24:20.280]  um yeah the federal government wants another kiss they want vat they want carbon taxes to
[02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:25.000]  pay the bankers who we've signed on to their derivatives we either get rid of the federal
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:30.760]  reserve or they will gut this country under agenda 21 they make you poor while they consolidate
[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:37.560]  your wealth ultra-rich anti-free market i've seen jp morgan chase ads where they say they
[02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:43.800]  basically bring you thanksgiving they made america strong look at this study american households hit
[02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:52.360]  43 year low in net worth cbs news and i've had dr paul craig roberts former reagan economist
[02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:56.120]  head of the treasury and policy number two there saying it's worse than that
[02:24:58.040 --> 02:25:01.880]  this is amazing going back to author tom woods who's in the film a documentary film
[02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:05.960]  notification we have the filmmaker now right here jason wrinkle probably on the nightly news with
[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:10.280]  us tonight as well and i'm gonna go into fourth hour overdrive the day to premiere of this expose
[02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:16.200]  on jp morgan since they've put out this propaganda tom front and center on your radar what do you
[02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:21.800]  think the obama election means and and and why do you think we're seeing a supercharged call
[02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:28.200]  for secession in all 50 states well the obama election wouldn't it doesn't mean all that much
[02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:33.800]  more than what the romney election would have meant uh it's probably a mildly smaller chance of
[02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:40.040]  of foreign policy bellocosity i guess but otherwise more or less more the same but i'll tell you
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:44.120]  alex what encouraged me was the fact that we did see these secession petitions now we have to bear
[02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:50.360]  in mind that all the same the constituency for secession right now is still very very small
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:56.200]  but the fact is in the past when somebody's been elected that people haven't liked very rarely have
[02:25:56.200 --> 02:26:00.680]  they talked about secession i mean you can you can gripe you can write articles but the idea that
[02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:06.040]  people would use the word secession when our overlords have tried to make this word totally
[02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:12.280]  completely toxic in our lexicon that to me is very significant so i i like the idea of talking about
[02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:18.520]  forbidden topics and getting people just to think in different ways like for example suppose we did
[02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:24.840]  have suppose as jefferson envisioned might happen the united states devolved into three separate
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:29.880]  units or something like this the union is just it's not an end in itself the union is a means to an
[02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:34.600]  end and if it's better to have three then maybe we have three suppose we had three or four or five
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:41.720]  or six states instead of one would every single one of them have this crazy foreign policy would
[02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:46.280]  every single one of them have intervened in world war one one of the worst decisions of the whole
[02:26:46.280 --> 02:26:52.360]  20th century in other words maybe life would actually be better if we had some kind of competition
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:58.840]  among these people instead of having one giant blob governing 350 million people why is that so
[02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:06.200]  unthinkable especially when that autocratic authoritarian out of control blob is openly
[02:27:06.200 --> 02:27:10.920]  run by foreign lobbyists and mega banks i mean have you seen the clubs on cnbc and all over the
[02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:15.880]  news where they say there is a technocratic world government run by foreign banks and they know best
[02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:20.360]  and we're under them now and yes they're appointing leaders of the european nations and yes you're
[02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:25.000]  going to live in 220 square foot houses so you can pay all your money to them and i mean it's like
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:31.720]  well this really sounds great well you know for for people who still believe in what their third
[02:27:31.720 --> 02:27:37.720]  grade civics textbook taught them about how a bill becomes a law and legislators are there just to
[02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:42.520]  try to make sure that that the public good is brought about and the will of the people is
[02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:48.280]  instantiated in the government what i mean this is so utterly at odds with what actually goes on
[02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:53.080]  and this is another reason that i'm happy to see that the government school monopoly is being broken
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:57.320]  because maybe people might actually be able to learn something that corresponds to reality
[02:27:57.960 --> 02:28:01.560]  that's right again tom wood's our guest long segment coming up and the three
[02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:06.600]  minutes we've got left in this segment jason rink i like to model other people that have been
[02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:11.080]  successful fighting the globalist you know four people out there the thinking what can i do tell
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:15.560]  us briefly about yourself and how you organize and got all these great men and women together
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:21.000]  to make nullification such a first rate film uh well you know i was inspired by tom's book
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:26.200]  nullification i mean that's really what articulated so many of these arguments to me in the first
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:31.400]  first place and uh then i partnered with uh the tenth amendment center out in california
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:36.440]  michael bolden out there who's been on the show just doing a great job of of being really the tip
[02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:41.880]  of the spear of states rights and tenth amendment issues and so what ended up happening is is i have
[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:46.520]  a nonprofit called the foundation for a free society that i'm the executive director of
[02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:52.040]  we helped cosponsor the nullify now tour there were stops in fort worth and in austin uh where
[02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:56.440]  we went all across the country had hundreds of people coming out to hear all of these speakers
[02:28:56.440 --> 02:29:01.480]  and then the big things have small beginnings yeah absolutely it started out just as one stop
[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:06.840]  we had over a dozen cities we went to uh we we decided to make the movie in the middle of the
[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:11.320]  tour we said wait a minute we've got to get this out there and so now you go from reaching thousands
[02:29:11.320 --> 02:29:16.520]  to reaching hundreds of thousands to reaching millions absolutely and and really it's just that
[02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:21.640]  it's a 72 minute film we wanted to make it short so that people could learn all they needed to know
[02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:27.160]  so that a legislator might watch it and be converted we wanted to give a tool in the battle
[02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:32.360]  to teach people what decentralized government is what federalism is all about and that we still
[02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:37.800]  have the power chase and rank tom woods are our guests i'm alex jones your host our home basis info

[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:28.840]  side of your barn or on your car uh or of a shopkeeper says you can uh we do not want people
[02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:32.040]  to put them on private property because then they can demonize us with that but the point is
[02:35:32.040 --> 02:35:35.640]  hundred thousand of them we're going to print them next week we probably won't have them to the first
[02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:43.880]  of the year that's not yet not yet not yet and i'm not attacking ron paul it's his farewell address
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:51.640]  i promise here let me show you oh man see ron paul farewell address and it's on that page and it
[02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:56.920]  opens up as a poster with his image made up in the words and then it's even on the back page here the
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:01.720]  whole incredible speech and that was my next point for you guys tom woods what did you think
[02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:07.480]  but well first off with what ron paul's done in education what countless others have done
[02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:13.640]  the the the lensing effect uh the chain reaction the exponential growth that's now happening that's
[02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:19.640]  why the globalist i believe are moving so quickly what do you and jason make of of the
[02:36:19.640 --> 02:36:24.920]  nullification becoming discovered as the rifle remedy as the film is called and what did you
[02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:30.520]  think of ron paul's farewell address two weeks ago well let me tell you i think these two things
[02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:35.640]  actually tie together because if you had told me three years ago four years ago that we would
[02:36:35.640 --> 02:36:40.680]  actually be talking about nullification i i would have wanted to believe you but i i just wouldn't
[02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:45.000]  have believed it because nullification is not considered something the new york times wants
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:49.880]  us to talk about and yet here it is i mean when i wrote the book nullification in 2010 i wrote it
[02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:54.680]  because i noticed all these grassroots groups around the country were getting interested in it
[02:36:54.680 --> 02:36:58.680]  some of them had seen some talks i'd given on the subject but i gave those talks as a historian i
[02:36:58.680 --> 02:37:02.600]  didn't think i was going to be given these talks about current events that suddenly people are
[02:37:02.600 --> 02:37:07.080]  grabbing onto this that's very exciting and the thing is i've had a lot of my books have gotten
[02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:12.280]  really nice blurbs from ron paul i had a forward by ron paul in one of my books but for nullification
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:16.760]  i knew he was probably going to run for president so i didn't ask him to endorse that book because
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:21.160]  i thought that's a very controversial position state nullification he's got enough baggage as it
[02:37:21.160 --> 02:37:26.280]  is i don't want to burden him and then he goes out on a campaign trail and more than once embraces
[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:30.360]  the idea of nullification so i mean i guess i should have asked him in the first place i mean i
[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:34.520]  should have i shouldn't have thought so little of the guy i should have known he's a truth teller
[02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:39.960]  come what may so yeah so i thought the speech was great but the very fact that a congressman
[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:44.920]  gives a farewell speech and it's covered and talked about it gets all around the country most
[02:37:44.920 --> 02:37:50.280]  congressmen end their careers in complete obscurity but it just goes to show the fact that he's
[02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:54.680]  basically a superstar you can't not cover him and tom i would imagine i would imagine you
[02:37:54.680 --> 02:37:58.920]  know the inside baseball this is just the beginning of ron paul's career do you know about the big
[02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:04.440]  three announcements he's getting ready to make i i might have a little bit of a sense of it but i
[02:38:04.440 --> 02:38:09.080]  haven't talked to him about them i i know them one one level removed but i'm not totally sure
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:14.200]  well no no i just it's gonna be pretty exciting i'm uh but i mean i just know some of the general
[02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:21.400]  stuff and uh so we're gonna be hearing a lot more from ron paul i'm so sick of learning
[02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:25.400]  stuff and then not being able to tell people about it it's like i'm saying one thing it's not
[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:30.440]  going to be it's not going to be uh you know let's get out there and endorse some guy who's with us
[02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:35.640]  on 12 of the issues it's not going to be that type of activity it's going to be hardcore this is our
[02:38:35.640 --> 02:38:41.720]  message take it or leave it and uh i'm not backing down it's going to be that it's going to be a 100
[02:38:41.720 --> 02:38:47.320]  octane ron paul yeah exactly you ain't seen nothing yet can we go out to break with that you ain't
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:51.960]  seen nothing yet but baby i think we've got it in the we'll play the last 30 seconds or 40 seconds
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:56.920]  of this uh i'm going out to break with that well i'm here you know i got a million questions i could
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:39:04.200]  ask uh what do you make of uh speaking of ron paul obviously i know ron paul you know ron paul
[02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:08.840]  he's a good guy he has gone a little bit towards the establishment i guess to get ready to run for
[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:13.880]  president in four years he's now admitted that but he is trying to get rid of the ndaa and do a lot of
[02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:19.480]  stuff i think if he would have fully taken on his dad's mantle there would have been no stopping him
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:24.120]  george washington type stuff but you know as they say a lot of sons end up wanting to go their own
[02:39:24.120 --> 02:39:31.880]  way both of you what's your take on ron paul well i think that um you know i think rand is is good
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:36.360]  that he's out there doing what he's doing i think he's taken a stance on a few issues
[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:43.080]  very strongly so i think he has come out on issues like the tsa and he's out there on ndaa marijuana
[02:39:43.080 --> 02:39:49.960]  stage rides absolutely so i really think i tend to be pretty big tent about some of these things
[02:39:49.960 --> 02:39:55.640]  because i say look it's a win for victor it's a it's a win for liberty if we can try to attack
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:40:00.920]  these things at any level that we can um i'm not somebody who thinks that rand paul is going to be
[02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:06.760]  the next ron paul but i do understand that that we need individuals who can navigate if they're
[02:40:06.760 --> 02:40:11.320]  going to be in politics they've got to navigate the political machine i have no idea what that i know
[02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:16.360]  but i mean that but but that machine is so shot he should be there pointing out it's a titanic
[02:40:16.360 --> 02:40:20.920]  so everybody goes to him when it goes under i mean i mean i'm just telling you his dad knows
[02:40:20.920 --> 02:40:25.880]  what he's doing not just from a moral perspective when something is so evil you want to fully
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:30.840]  distance yourself with it i mean when you get in a latrine you don't you don't clean it up it gets
[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:36.600]  all over you absolutely and so i think that to the degree that rand paul can speak the hardcore
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:40.840]  message of ron paul i mean ron paul changed my life it's why i'm here right now i wrote a book
[02:40:40.840 --> 02:40:45.720]  called ron paul father the tea party it's a biography of ron paul i love the man i think i
[02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:50.360]  love is no compromise stance and that's the only reason millions and millions of people got behind
[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:55.560]  him and let's be clear rand paul is great and an ally and and and i agree with 95 of what he's doing
[02:40:55.560 --> 02:41:00.040]  it's just the missed opportunity and i know we're influencing him because i know when i talk about
[02:41:00.040 --> 02:41:06.280]  this it's having an effect we need to say hey hey we think this is important we think more hardcore
[02:41:06.280 --> 02:41:11.160]  not less hardcore that's how you beat the republicans and the democrats in that senate race tom
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:16.600]  well you know i i of course i'm sure you guys would agree with me i wasn't happy with the
[02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:20.200]  romney endorsement and certainly the willingness to go out and give speeches for romney and a
[02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:24.920]  lot of this stuff and then sometimes i see rand paul on tv and he's saying yeah i guess i could go
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:30.040]  along with closing loopholes or whatever you know and sometimes it sounds like it's one thing to say
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:33.960]  i have to express the liberty message in a way that'll resonate with the tea party people i'm
[02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:40.200]  okay with that it's if you start talking like a dc politico i'm not okay with that but on the other
[02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:46.200]  hand if we compare rand paul to any of the old right senators or congressmen from the early 50s
[02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:51.480]  we compare him to robert taft whom the ron paul people love robert taft rand paul's much better
[02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:56.840]  than robert taft is a much better voting or even very goldwater so i mean it's so you know i've been
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:42:01.720]  hard on him but at the same time i realized that i'm a lot easier on people who lived in the 1950s
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:06.200]  and i am on rand paul even though he's better than all but i think that's what it is though i don't
[02:42:06.200 --> 02:42:11.560]  don't let him get away with it sure but that's it it's when it's now it's personal you invest
[02:42:11.560 --> 02:42:16.040]  that this is going to be the new rand paul and then it doesn't actually turn out like that i think
[02:42:16.040 --> 02:42:21.320]  that's what they need to understand is that's what that's what gets people you know uh a little
[02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:25.960]  hyped up but but but but i agree listen here's the issue what do you guys think about this hoax
[02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:29.960]  because there's clearly election fraud not that i'm saying romney was good but i call elections
[02:42:29.960 --> 02:42:35.560]  like i see it look like there was fraud against al gore in 2000 clearly fraud bev herris who's been
[02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:41.400]  a democrat clearly fraud against romney uh clearly the fixes in and they say the mandate is here for
[02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:46.680]  more socialism and everything obama wants he wants when half the public didn't even vote
[02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:51.400]  and this republicans need to become more socialist now that's how you win and we need to legalize all
[02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:56.360]  the illegals no we ought to elect hispanics who are constitutionalists to a you know great extent
[02:42:56.360 --> 02:43:03.000]  like cruise we need to but you can't take 600 million latin americans in and give them welfare
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:08.200]  it's going to bankrupt the country again that's something rand's coming out going well we don't
[02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:12.200]  want you know hispanics to think we're going to send them back to mexico well i mean mexico
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:18.280]  doesn't let other latin americans in or they would implode i mean we've got sinking third world despotic
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:25.720]  crime syndicates literally sinking and and and and then now we could take 30 million illegals in
[02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:30.520]  this country probably a boom if there was no welfare but the problem is these people get on
[02:43:30.520 --> 02:43:36.200]  welfare they become state clients and when they become citizens 91 of them vote to take my guns
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:43.240]  tom what do we do about this yeah this is a i think this is probably the hardest issue to sort out
[02:43:43.240 --> 02:43:48.600]  because there are dangers on both sides on the one hand uh an anti-immigration policy could spill
[02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:53.480]  over into all kinds of civil liberties problems that would be employed against the regular people
[02:43:53.480 --> 02:43:56.600]  which is what what winds up having people who have followed all the rules and everything
[02:43:56.600 --> 02:44:01.240]  they wind up somehow always being the ones that the laws are enforced against so i'm worried about
[02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:06.440]  a police state against immigration but oh yeah you try to come here legally it's almost impossible
[02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:10.600]  and and and they harass you come here illegally they leave you alone right you're right but then
[02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:15.640]  on the other hand um you know like jefferson and some of the founding fathers they were against
[02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:19.960]  the idea of mass immigration from even from europe because their view was these people are going to
[02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:23.800]  bring to the united states old world political ideas these people don't even know how to live
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:27.880]  in a free society they're going to have monarchical ideas i don't want a whole bunch of these people
[02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:33.480]  in in our it's not they kicked a bunch of tories out so they're so it's really tricky to decide
[02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:39.640]  exactly under these circumstances what the right position is on immigration this is this is one
[02:44:39.640 --> 02:44:44.040]  that i'm i'm frankly stumped on i mean i am very concerned about immigration i think it is a big
[02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:48.600]  problem especially with the welfare state but on the other hand when you fight against it they're
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:52.120]  going to want uh id cards they're going to want chips they're going to want all these other things
[02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:56.120]  that we don't want them to have so it's hard to know exactly what to do no you're right well the
[02:44:56.120 --> 02:45:02.120]  bottom line is throw throw it back in their court okay don't tell illegals from all over the world
[02:45:02.120 --> 02:45:06.520]  come here and have your baby for free and then you get to stay you all go on welfare and on average
[02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:12.200]  you get 61 thousand dollars a year that's that's that's the new federal numbers that's ridiculous
[02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:16.520]  and that's gonna end you know they have federal websites we've shown them that tell people how
[02:45:16.520 --> 02:45:20.520]  to come here and get on and they say come here when you're pregnant have the kid you're in like
[02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:25.480]  flin and you know it is a very small percentage of country i don't remember offhand i wrote about
[02:45:25.480 --> 02:45:30.360]  this once it's a very small percentage of countries that have birthright citizenship almost none so it
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:35.400]  would not i mean mexico doesn't have that so we would not be evil or racist to get rid of that
[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:40.840]  given that exactly let me come to mexico and get free welfare and have my kids there and all that
[02:45:40.840 --> 02:45:44.920]  and maybe i'd see that's what i'm saying how do you have free trade when the other countries
[02:45:44.920 --> 02:45:51.480]  aren't free we call it free and it destroys us well in this in this particular case uh mexico
[02:45:51.480 --> 02:45:56.680]  has actually a very restrictive immigration policy it's actually very hard for people to go to mexico
[02:45:56.680 --> 02:46:03.480]  half the time so the vast majority of the countries of the world have some kind of limits and certainly
[02:46:03.480 --> 02:46:07.320]  don't have birthright citizenship so unless we're going to say all the countries of the world are
[02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:13.560]  wicked and racist there's nothing wrong with with exactly it's the welfare we could take 30 million
[02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:18.360]  people uh a decade and would probably make us boom because we're not overfill like people say
[02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:23.240]  if there was no welfare and also think of the type of people who would come they want to work
[02:46:23.240 --> 02:46:26.680]  just if it doesn't have welfare be them the industrious people who actually want to work
[02:46:27.800 --> 02:46:34.360]  just like our country was founded there you go i'm ranting here um jason rank here over there
[02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:39.800]  what's your take on this well i want to i want to talk about the uh obama mandate that he supposedly
[02:46:39.800 --> 02:46:44.520]  got uh with his re-election because what we're seeing going on all over the country regarding
[02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:49.480]  nullification is the opposite of that i mean the supreme court ruled that obama care was
[02:46:49.480 --> 02:46:54.440]  constitutional based on the taxing authority of congress and and so now you got 15 states who've
[02:46:54.440 --> 02:46:59.000]  already said we're not going to implement the state exchanges including states like Ohio
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:04.600]  and michigan and states that uh you wouldn't think would would would be bucking this system it is a
[02:47:04.600 --> 02:47:09.720]  hoax that people are endorsing obama absolutely and then you've got states like washington and
[02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:16.360]  colorado that have approved uh recreational marijuana when when obama has been worse about
[02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:22.440]  using the department of justice and the irs to shake down state-based marijuana dispensaries
[02:47:22.440 --> 02:47:27.800]  he stepped up the war on drugs and you've got states three times the raids of bush absolutely
[02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:32.120]  and so what we're seeing is now we've got 18 states that have medical marijuana or recreational
[02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:36.200]  marijuana we've got four more states that are going to introduce in 25 and this is a guy that
[02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:41.000]  admits he's done marijuana and cocaine there's photos of him smoking dope how do you put people
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:47.720]  in prison for smoking pot when you're a pot smoker and the word is he smokes it right now how do you
[02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:54.040]  do it i don't smoke it except maybe you know once every two three years or something and literally
[02:47:54.040 --> 02:47:58.680]  it's a lot better on average than alcohol for people but there's this demonization of it
[02:47:58.680 --> 02:48:03.320]  yeah and what we're seeing happening right now is we're seeing a cultural shift we're seeing people
[02:48:03.320 --> 02:48:08.920]  waking up to this idea that hey the drug war is unconstitutional there was no amendment passed
[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:14.040]  like alcohol prohibition it's throwing our countrymen in jail for nonviolent offenses and it gives
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:17.880]  the criminals money gives the criminals money absolutely it's it's it's it's riddled with
[02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:22.600]  holes and we're starting to see conservatives coming around to this idea because pat robertson
[02:48:22.600 --> 02:48:27.640]  absolutely and we've got that's because they've all smoked it george washington smoked it i'm sick
[02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:34.360]  of it it's just it's this is it's collapsing and the big secret is the federal government can enforce
[02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:40.200]  these unconstitutional mandates and laws without the cooperation of the states that's the big secret
[02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:46.040]  and so they can't raid all the dispensaries they can't shut down all of the activity they can't go
[02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:51.880]  in there and run a state-based exchange they need the states to run that for obama care to work and
[02:48:51.880 --> 02:48:58.760]  so the big secret is the emperor has no clothes and when states state legislators governors
[02:48:58.760 --> 02:49:04.360]  citizens stand up they use the ballot initiative everybody's just got to drag their feet block
[02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:10.920]  not comply criticize shout down the system tom isn't the system losing its credibility but i'm not
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:14.840]  just cheerleading this i mean i i've heard the awesome police chief going no one trust the
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:19.080]  government anymore we've got to behave ourselves this is big nebris inski's coming out and saying
[02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:25.560]  that i mean that i think their power grab is a sign of their weakness yeah i think so too i mean
[02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:31.560]  now of course we still have to bear in mind that we are very much a minority but we are a minority
[02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:38.440]  that is intelligent and informed and hardworking and we participate and we we really work at this
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:43.160]  so we are a very effective minority and then it does concern them that a lot of people are
[02:49:43.160 --> 02:49:47.160]  unplugging from the message that the mainstream media is giving them now at the same time the
[02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:53.000]  other day apparently uh joe biden was out christmas shopping at the local cost code in washington
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:58.840]  and people were hanging on him and posing for pictures and i thought now we'll know when we're
[02:49:58.840 --> 02:50:03.640]  getting somewhere when the vice president walks in and people turn their backs they're giving them
[02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:08.840]  the raspberry yeah but you know that people you know that people that that that even hate folks
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:13.960]  though love celebrity just want to feel important that's part of the two-facedness of it and of
[02:50:13.960 --> 02:50:19.080]  course he knew the area he was in i mean look at romney today at mcdonald's as another stunt i mean
[02:50:19.080 --> 02:50:23.240]  it's so ridiculous what do you think romney was at the white house doing making sure his interest
[02:50:23.240 --> 02:50:29.880]  won't be hurt and telling telling obama hey you know it was all staged yeah i have no idea but i
[02:50:29.880 --> 02:50:34.360]  find it hard to believe that obama was interested in getting romney's advice on how to make government
[02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:41.000]  more efficient i really find the the official line very hard to swallow well they want conservatives
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:45.800]  to just go to sleep and then pat us on the head and take our guns i want to talk to you guys when
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:51.880]  come back what happens if the system tries to ban not by law but by order which they're saying they

[02:54:41.400 --> 02:54:47.320]  quite a job servicing the other 130 or so i'm not complaining it's just something new for me
[02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:54.280]  somebody's that like 60 70 100 stations 120 and i mean these are like 50 000 watts in california

[02:55:02.280 --> 02:55:07.160]  station managers and owners are saying i should think you were crazy jones but i turned on cnn
[02:55:07.160 --> 02:55:13.880]  and they were announcing world government so our information is becoming mainline and we have to do
[02:55:13.880 --> 02:55:18.600]  that before we can really turn things around and ron paul talked about global government
[02:55:18.600 --> 02:55:22.760]  in his farewell address but i'm also going to start something where first amendment champions
[02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:29.560]  in focus i'm announcing this so that john harman up there at network affiliate uh i'm just announcing
[02:55:29.560 --> 02:55:33.480]  this now i'm just telling him he hadn't even heard of this where every week i'm going to have like
[02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:39.480]  five ten minutes with a station manager on or host whoever they want to promote that station
[02:55:39.480 --> 02:55:44.520]  their sales staff and a call to arms to get the word out about those affiliates now i'm going to
[02:55:44.520 --> 02:55:51.720]  start with our chicago affiliate next week okay i'm just going to plug it right now but they have
[02:55:51.720 --> 02:55:54.760]  the big sheet because i was cutting a bunch of liners this morning for like an hour before
[02:55:54.760 --> 02:55:59.240]  i went on air tom woods we got one more segment with you coming up but i have been saying a lot
[02:55:59.240 --> 02:56:06.040]  here um what about the danger of the kleptocrats trying to accelerate things into open confrontation
[02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:12.840]  because there's a lot of scurrying around the illinois uh governor just tried to ban semi-autos
[02:56:12.840 --> 02:56:18.280]  through executive fiat yesterday uh obama said he's going to get the guns under the radar uh
[02:56:18.280 --> 02:56:26.280]  ban all semi-autos with just an atf order what's your concern in that area well i mean certainly
[02:56:26.280 --> 02:56:31.160]  there are state-level problems and of course the federal government could you know not that it
[02:56:31.160 --> 02:56:39.080]  doesn't feel constrained by the constitution obviously but i actually am not i'm actually
[02:56:39.080 --> 02:56:45.720]  thinking that uh for the left anyway the idea of gun control and stuff is almost dead even though
[02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:51.240]  they talk a lot about it you know you have a a column bind thing or whatever and they talk
[02:56:51.240 --> 02:56:55.400]  about gun control then nothing happens they'd rather just gut the money and bankrupt the treasury
[02:56:55.400 --> 02:56:59.720]  that i mean they know they're hurting us there yeah exactly because the gun people are you would
[02:56:59.720 --> 02:57:03.800]  have to invest a huge amount of political capital here and i feel like obama's got a bunch of other
[02:57:03.800 --> 02:57:08.680]  things he wants to accomplish and i think he'll talk a good game from the left point of view
[02:57:08.680 --> 02:57:12.680]  but i think in in practice he's probably gonna leave that issue alone so he wants to shut down
[02:57:12.680 --> 02:57:18.440]  half our power plants pay general motors to move to china get he doubled the number of people on
[02:57:18.440 --> 02:57:23.000]  on food stamps he wants to double that again just break us first then get the guns later
[02:57:23.560 --> 02:57:27.560]  well that could be that possible that's a possible strategy i mean who knows what's your
[02:57:27.560 --> 02:57:31.560]  take on this look at the rest of his agenda it's bad enough as it is jason what's your take on
[02:57:31.560 --> 02:57:37.720]  that question well i mean i think uh you know we the un recently made a comment about the fact
[02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:42.280]  that marijuana was legalized in a couple of states here no they said it violates treaty they
[02:57:42.280 --> 02:57:47.160]  want to run things right so i mean when you've got the un making statements about that and talking
[02:57:47.160 --> 02:57:51.800]  about how that that's problematic from their perspective i don't think it's a far leap to
[02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:56.600]  think that that the un can and global forces will get involved in trying to disarm the american
[02:57:56.600 --> 02:58:02.200]  people now the problem is if there's a lot of guns out there and i think that the american people
[02:58:02.200 --> 02:58:08.280]  still have that revolutionary spirit within them that no i agree with what you're saying and tom
[02:58:08.280 --> 02:58:13.160]  we've checkmated them by three four million guns a month the gun culture is the thing taking over
[02:58:14.040 --> 02:58:17.560]  tom we're coming back in one minute i want to but to start asking you that right now
[02:58:17.560 --> 02:58:22.200]  do you think the gun culture is one of the strongest things we've got going for us i do i
[02:58:22.200 --> 02:58:27.240]  think it's one thing first of all that unites everybody who is even slightly right of center
[02:58:27.240 --> 02:58:32.840]  like the just a plain vanilla republicans tend to be basically okay on guns the ron paul people
[02:58:32.840 --> 02:58:38.200]  uh well the neocons can go either way we'll stay there yeah but i mean all the liberals i know
[02:58:38.200 --> 02:58:43.320]  we're buying guns we're even waking them up we're converting them a little fool thank you for listening

[03:00:48.360 --> 03:00:53.320]  they underwrote america go ahead well i think i just want to say and point out that this is really
[03:00:53.320 --> 03:01:00.200]  all about uh the war on no the war on whether or not we is free people because that's what's about
[03:01:00.200 --> 03:01:03.880]  it's not about the states it's about the people it's about the sovereignty of the individual
[03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:08.120]  do we have the power to say no when our rights are violated when our property is being bought
[03:01:08.120 --> 03:01:12.360]  no you don't i'm sorry that's that's and that's the point the federal government is clamping down
[03:01:12.360 --> 03:01:17.080]  on that they're saying you don't have the ability to say no to unconstitutional drug wars they you
[03:01:17.080 --> 03:01:21.160]  don't have the ability to say no to the unconstitutional war on terror you don't have the
[03:01:21.160 --> 03:01:27.240]  ability to say no to unconstitutional foreign wars or or national health care anything like that
[03:01:27.240 --> 03:01:31.240]  you've got to take whatever policy we come up with and we're going to shove it down your throats
[03:01:31.240 --> 03:01:35.320]  and what we're saying and with the tom's book nullification with the tenth amendment center
[03:01:35.320 --> 03:01:41.560]  with nullification the rightful remedy is we're saying no oh so extreme that is not the case
[03:01:41.560 --> 03:01:46.120]  we are saying you're saying washington shouldn't dictate everything including what your kids eat
[03:01:46.120 --> 03:01:51.160]  how dare you yeah and you know what it's not just because they can't do it well it's not just because
[03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:55.560]  the federal government's inefficient at doing these it's not their jurisdiction absolutely they
[03:01:55.560 --> 03:02:00.120]  don't have the right and they've turned it around they've made it seem as though the third federal
[03:02:00.120 --> 03:02:04.920]  government is supreme and all they do and and i like to ask people and say well if the federal
[03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:10.680]  government is supreme and the supremacy clause supreme whatever they want why enumerate any powers
[03:02:10.680 --> 03:02:15.000]  at all why not just wait make the constitution one line which says the federal government can do
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:21.400]  whatever it wants the federal government is god and obama is its profit absolutely so maybe we
[03:02:21.400 --> 03:02:28.360]  should do that well you know i i think it's getting to the point where we are being pressed the people
[03:02:28.360 --> 03:02:34.200]  are being pressed to really as far as they can and and we're going to see over the next few years
[03:02:34.200 --> 03:02:39.800]  whether or not the states and the people and the those that represent us at the state level uh
[03:02:39.800 --> 03:02:45.080]  whether they have the cahones to stand up for it i mean whether or not they are going to stand with
[03:02:45.080 --> 03:02:50.200]  the people or whether they're going to stand do we have wavos or do we not great points jason
[03:02:50.200 --> 03:02:57.160]  closing comments on tom woods well um here's here's how i look at things sometimes i hear
[03:02:58.120 --> 03:03:01.320]  even a conservative group say we can't do nullification because it won't work
[03:03:02.040 --> 03:03:07.640]  but to hear that coming from the conservatives when for the past hundred years i can't see anything
[03:03:07.640 --> 03:03:11.880]  they've done has worked nothing they've done has slowed down the federal well they've been compromised
[03:03:11.880 --> 03:03:17.480]  yeah so i mean so my view is we could we could write a one of those gag books and call it great
[03:03:17.480 --> 03:03:23.480]  conservative victories and be one of those books full of blank pages for these people tell me this
[03:03:23.480 --> 03:03:28.120]  won't work well even if it doesn't work it's no worse than the strategy you guys have adopted
[03:03:28.120 --> 03:03:32.440]  but in other words if we're going to have any success we can just do the same old thing over
[03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:38.680]  and over and over we've got to try something different so and incidentally we have the arguments so
[03:03:38.680 --> 03:03:44.680]  overwhelmingly on our side today i went through line by line i went through a a critic of nullification
[03:03:44.680 --> 03:03:48.920]  i basically left this guy in shreds over at tom woods dot com to scroll down you'll find it
[03:03:48.920 --> 03:03:52.680]  and also finally one thing alex you might get a kick out of is when i wrote the book
[03:03:52.680 --> 03:03:56.040]  nullification i knew that you know you're going to be attacked if you talk about nullification
[03:03:56.040 --> 03:04:01.480]  you're evil you're racist or whatever so i made a video guessing what it would be like to be interviewed
[03:04:01.480 --> 03:04:06.440]  in the mainstream media about nullification and it's called interview with a zombie and i've seen
[03:04:06.440 --> 03:04:11.560]  it interview interview with a zombie dot com you'll see exactly what i mean here i am giving
[03:04:12.120 --> 03:04:16.760]  completely rational arguments and the guy who plays the zombie just keeps calling me names
[03:04:16.760 --> 03:04:21.640]  and calling me names but little by little we're cracking through because after four years of obama
[03:04:21.640 --> 03:04:27.160]  and every critic of obama being called a racist these types of words just don't work anymore i agree
[03:04:27.160 --> 03:04:32.920]  and you notice the neocons and liberals are like don't do nullification it's kooky it's bad but their
[03:04:32.920 --> 03:04:37.320]  whole program in the defense department is built around blocking it and and tom i want to get you
[03:04:37.320 --> 03:04:42.360]  on soon dealing with the economic meltdown that you've been predicting uh so accurately and i want

[03:09:03.720 --> 03:09:12.600]  to watch nfl football so nfl football was you know on all day long and so i was sitting there we had
[03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:19.640]  the audio off a lot of the time but i saw this ad about thanksgiving in america and i was like man
[03:09:19.640 --> 03:09:24.120]  this is a really good ad this is and and then at the end of it it was brought to you by jp
[03:09:24.120 --> 03:09:30.760]  morgan chase and folks jp morgan chase is the emperor of the new world order and golden sex
[03:09:30.760 --> 03:09:36.200]  is darth vader the enforcer i mean you cannot get higher in the pyramid of the rothschild
[03:09:36.200 --> 03:09:42.360]  rockefeller combine the folks that don't want to free market the people that want a world government
[03:09:42.360 --> 03:09:47.000]  these are the people destroying this country and i'm not saying everybody that works at jp morgan
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:52.680]  chase is evil i'm not saying you know that that they're getting a home loan from them is you know
[03:09:52.680 --> 03:09:57.960]  that that inherently you're bad i'm saying the directives of it they are the founders of the
[03:09:57.960 --> 03:10:02.440]  private federal reserve they are the biggest shareholders of it they're the ones that set
[03:10:02.440 --> 03:10:08.520]  the agenda they're the ones that bank rolled obama and mit romney and you see this well i'm
[03:10:08.520 --> 03:10:13.000]  going to play the special report here then we're going to break and i'll come back with my review
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:18.680]  of world war z i'm going to do a more detailed one on the nightly news but i need to talk about
[03:10:18.680 --> 03:10:23.640]  this because it dovetails with all the eugenics of the dehumanization but trying to condense down
[03:10:23.640 --> 03:10:28.200]  to eight nine minutes here all the things they're doing i mean they're behind it all if you're a
[03:10:28.200 --> 03:10:32.360]  prison planet dot tv viewer you'll see all the articles and documents where i back up my claims
[03:10:32.360 --> 03:10:36.440]  you're a radio listener you can just write down notes of what i'm saying we're also going to post
[03:10:36.440 --> 03:10:41.160]  it in the next hour at prison planet dot com and infowars dot com on youtube for everybody
[03:10:41.160 --> 03:10:46.280]  i get this video out it needs to go viral but it is goldman sacks they're the ones if you got to
[03:10:46.280 --> 03:10:53.320]  say any group destroying america they're where the mf global money went i mean this is new world order
[03:10:53.320 --> 03:11:06.040]  i have soar on morgoth the blz bob bathomet satan leviathan uh this is it let's go ahead
[03:11:06.040 --> 03:11:11.880]  and play this analysis that erin dykes and i put together alex jones here to report on one of the
[03:11:11.880 --> 03:11:19.640]  most sickening displays of high tech propaganda i have ever witnessed since the week of Thanksgiving
[03:11:19.640 --> 03:11:29.560]  the airwaves have been bombarded with a commercial paid for and produced by jp morgan chase showing
[03:11:29.560 --> 03:11:37.000]  iconic images of soldiers returning home and the 9 11 attacks and people toasting each other
[03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:43.000]  over turkeys the very essence of americana looks like it was directed by steven spielberg
[03:11:43.560 --> 03:11:52.520]  let's analyze and break down this sickening piece of propaganda let's give thanks for an idea
[03:11:52.520 --> 03:12:02.520]  a grand idea called america deathly conjuring an image that only existed in norman rockwell's
[03:12:02.520 --> 03:12:09.080]  america we are then told finally that this image of a beautiful and strong america
[03:12:09.080 --> 03:12:16.680]  is brought to you by jp morgan chase the very authors of our decline and eventual collapse
[03:12:16.680 --> 03:12:25.240]  it is incredibly painful to see them putting out this this pro family pro america image
[03:12:25.240 --> 03:12:31.720]  so that they can brand themselves to it so they can tie themselves to it when they are at the heart
[03:12:31.720 --> 03:12:37.160]  of destroying our republic and taking this country into debt bondage let's analyze this piece a little
[03:12:37.160 --> 03:12:42.120]  bit further imagine the cold-blooded calculation that when you're all sitting around watching the
[03:12:42.120 --> 03:12:47.880]  football game after enjoying the turkey with your family grandma's there the grandchildren are there
[03:12:47.880 --> 03:12:53.720]  the fire is going and you're bombarded every 10 minutes because i was watching football with family
[03:12:53.720 --> 03:13:01.480]  as well with jp morgan chase jp morgan chase they bring you america they bring you prosperity
[03:13:01.480 --> 03:13:06.680]  they bring you freedom when they are steering this country towards economic collapse because
[03:13:06.680 --> 03:13:14.280]  that's how they conquer you is by economic fraud they want you in debt to them for nothing but
[03:13:14.280 --> 03:13:20.280]  zeros and ones that they created fraudulently on their derivative sheet in his farewell address to
[03:13:20.280 --> 03:13:28.520]  congress ron paul pointed out who the real enemy is the megabanks he called them authoritarian
[03:13:28.520 --> 03:13:35.480]  psychopaths psychopathic authoritarians endorse government initiated force to change the world
[03:13:35.480 --> 03:13:43.480]  he went on to point out the fact that when americans lost their homes goldman sacks jp morgan bank of
[03:13:43.480 --> 03:13:50.600]  america wells fargo and others got bailed out they did the big banks the large corporations and foreign
[03:13:50.600 --> 03:13:57.240]  banks and foreign central banks get bailed out in 2008 and the middle class lost their jobs and
[03:13:57.240 --> 03:14:02.840]  their homes the megabanks led by jp morgan chase over the last few decades put their operatives
[03:14:02.840 --> 03:14:11.080]  into all the major regulatory positions i think the truth is that wall street regulates the congress
[03:14:11.720 --> 03:14:17.560]  they have untold unlimited amounts of money money which they use by the way to get the deregulation
[03:14:18.520 --> 03:14:25.480]  then they implode the economy in 2008 threaten martial law if the government doesn't shine
[03:14:25.480 --> 03:14:31.640]  on to their too big to fail derivatives and they did the same thing in europe three bailouts later
[03:14:31.640 --> 03:14:38.440]  the people are more poor than ever the taxes are sky high and the tax money is going to goldman sacks
[03:14:38.440 --> 03:14:44.280]  jp morgan and others who again brag that they've conquered the world are we all just living and
[03:14:44.280 --> 03:14:49.240]  dying for what the central banks do to answer your question we are absolutely slaves to central
[03:14:49.240 --> 03:14:53.000]  banks because and we'd love to be slaves of the economy but the economic numbers continue to do
[03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:58.440]  nothing but is this global governance at last is it one world the central bankers in charge
[03:14:58.440 --> 03:15:03.560]  if authoritarianism leads to poverty and war and less freedom for all individuals
[03:15:03.560 --> 03:15:09.400]  and is controlled by rich special interests the people should be begging for liberty i think
[03:15:09.400 --> 03:15:16.200]  it's important to also note that they say america is about being a free market free markets free
[03:15:16.200 --> 03:15:23.960]  enterprise and free refills so jp morgan chase implies that they are free market when their
[03:15:23.960 --> 03:15:30.680]  entire business model is designed around government bailouts and government contracts
[03:15:30.680 --> 03:15:37.960]  and when the goldman sacks and jp morgan are at the core of pushing planned economies via agenda
[03:15:37.960 --> 03:15:44.200]  21 their business model is shutting down their competition using government regulation and
[03:15:44.200 --> 03:15:50.360]  then exempting themselves from those regulations while becoming bloated on the blood sweat and
[03:15:50.360 --> 03:15:57.320]  tears of the american people via corporate welfare the circumstances surrounding jp morgan is how big
[03:15:57.320 --> 03:16:02.600]  opportunity is this right now the american people are angry at wall street you know what they want
[03:16:02.600 --> 03:16:08.680]  they want our financial institutions to invest in the real economy they want wall street to be
[03:16:08.680 --> 03:16:13.960]  lending money to businesses jp morgan claims they want to get america moving in this ad
[03:16:13.960 --> 03:16:19.080]  but they want to see that entrepreneurial spirit thrive while making investments in china where they
[03:16:19.080 --> 03:16:25.240]  have no carbon tax jp morgan is at the center of driving a program to shut down the majority
[03:16:25.240 --> 03:16:30.440]  of power plants in the country and quote bankrupt coal which is projected to more than double the
[03:16:30.440 --> 03:16:37.160]  price of electricity jp morgan chase and the other five mega banks are diametrically opposed to a
[03:16:37.160 --> 03:16:43.640]  real free market and a true system with competition and private property they can only exist via a
[03:16:43.640 --> 03:16:49.400]  government license to operate their private federal reserve while people like jayme diamond who
[03:16:49.400 --> 03:16:55.480]  they're now pushing to be the new treasury secretary sits on the highest levels of the private
[03:16:55.480 --> 03:17:03.480]  federal reserve board while he sits as the head of jp morgan chase giving trillions of dollars
[03:17:03.480 --> 03:17:10.280]  of free credit to himself and his shareholders that gives a new meaning to conflict of interest
[03:17:10.280 --> 03:17:15.800]  and fox guarding the handhouse and who owns the private federal reserve the rockefellers and the
[03:17:15.800 --> 03:17:23.000]  rothschilds 12 years ago they merged their banks in 2012 they publicly merged their family fortunes
[03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:27.720]  i'm not just talking to people in the united states i'm talking to humans worldwide we are
[03:17:27.720 --> 03:17:33.160]  under banks for occupation they think you're stupid they think you don't understand finance
[03:17:33.160 --> 03:17:39.080]  they think you don't understand what fraud is this is a criminal takeover by a group of globalists
[03:17:39.080 --> 03:17:45.160]  that have given themselves unlimited capital through fiat fraudulent derivatives i want to
[03:17:45.160 --> 03:17:52.040]  close with a quote by one of our greatest founding fathers thomas jefferson because he understood
[03:17:52.040 --> 03:17:58.760]  who the enemy was 230 plus years ago we need to understand who the enemy is today if the american
[03:17:58.760 --> 03:18:04.680]  people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by
[03:18:04.680 --> 03:18:09.800]  deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all
[03:18:09.800 --> 03:18:15.880]  property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered i believe
[03:18:15.880 --> 03:18:21.320]  that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies the issuing
[03:18:21.320 --> 03:18:28.600]  power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs thomas
[03:18:28.600 --> 03:18:35.480]  jefferson the issuing power they can issue unlimited fraudulent derivatives paper and then
[03:18:35.480 --> 03:18:43.240]  have government shine on to the fraud they created and declare us their dead slaves i'm alec
[03:18:43.240 --> 03:18:49.160]  shones from full wars dot com and if you are watching this transmission remember you are the
[03:18:49.160 --> 03:18:55.720]  resistance that's right and we're going to come back and i'm going to give you my review of the
[03:18:55.720 --> 03:19:02.200]  new world order propaganda world war z i tell you brad pit and his un front war criminal wife
[03:19:02.200 --> 03:19:05.800]  really ought to be ashamed of themselves no matter how many minority children they tow around with
[03:19:05.800 --> 03:19:11.080]  them as a as a set piece of how good they are brad pit who i know knows about the new world
[03:19:11.080 --> 03:19:15.960]  order i've talked to multiple people in hollywood that know him show show to my films erin russo's
[03:19:15.960 --> 03:19:23.560]  film erin russo actually i'm not going to get into it it's just really really is a major bummer
[03:19:23.560 --> 03:19:29.000]  uh but i guess he likes flying around helicopters being treated like he's important i've gotten
[03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:32.920]  the breakdown on this film it's really sickening and it's just part for the course maybe brad

[03:24:20.440 --> 03:24:27.720]  okay as is often the case i saw some emails coming to the office a few days ago i saw some
[03:24:27.720 --> 03:24:33.800]  comments on youtube uh last night hey alex why aren't you covering and doing a film review for
[03:24:33.800 --> 03:24:40.840]  world war z you know this is incredible propaganda so i went and watched the trailer and i went and
[03:24:40.840 --> 03:24:45.800]  found they've got the full synopsis online they're not hiding uh that it is basically an adaptation
[03:24:45.800 --> 03:24:52.680]  of the book and is is the book you know broken into three and having my background knowledge
[03:24:52.680 --> 03:24:59.400]  i immediately knew what was happening this is a united nations world government acclimation event
[03:24:59.400 --> 03:25:03.880]  angelina joe lee and we have some shots of her up on screen for tv viewers radio listeners
[03:25:03.880 --> 03:25:09.160]  is typing angelina joe lee u n does all these disgusting photo ops claiming she's trying to
[03:25:09.160 --> 03:25:15.080]  help africans when she's post pushing the african invasion she pushed the mass murder of libya and
[03:25:15.080 --> 03:25:21.800]  handing it over to al qaeda now the 20 month attack on syria using al qaeda i mean she is a world
[03:25:21.800 --> 03:25:28.120]  government front lady uh consciously and it because there's nothing worse than being a pro-war thug
[03:25:28.760 --> 03:25:32.440]  and then saying you're a humanitarian i mean it's like obama the peace prize winner i mean
[03:25:32.440 --> 03:25:39.000]  angelina joe lee is really bad news and it blows me away because when you hear from one hollywood
[03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:42.920]  person oh yeah they've seen your films blah blah blah this is like 10 years ago and then again
[03:25:42.920 --> 03:25:47.560]  about six years ago and then to hear from another prominent hollywood person you're like they've
[03:25:47.560 --> 03:25:51.480]  seen my films and know about the new world order and they're doing all this show they've clearly
[03:25:51.480 --> 03:25:57.720]  decided to join the dark side i even said like five years ago well they must be uh infiltrating it
[03:25:57.720 --> 03:26:04.680]  yeah yeah no that is not what's happening and i mean they're just doing so much bad stuff brad pit
[03:26:04.680 --> 03:26:09.240]  angelina joe lee you're disgusting and this whole i just hope when you're old is shriveled if things
[03:26:09.240 --> 03:26:13.480]  even go that far you remember how worthless your life was there's still time to turn back
[03:26:13.480 --> 03:26:21.080]  just like i told lance armstrong there is still time there is still time and brad pit may just
[03:26:21.080 --> 03:26:28.280]  be stupid uh angelina joe lee just disgusting now i'll do a larger review on the tv show tonight
[03:26:28.280 --> 03:26:34.840]  but i just wanted to go for some of this it pushes and when i saw the trailer before i did research
[03:26:34.840 --> 03:26:38.360]  i went this is what it is and i went and looked it up it was that that's how much i know these
[03:26:38.360 --> 03:26:42.440]  people it's it's incredible i first watched the trailer last time i'm like okay everybody's saying
[03:26:42.440 --> 03:26:47.160]  look at this there's another zombie movie it's all about dehumanization teaching us humans are ugly
[03:26:47.160 --> 03:26:55.560]  and bad the giant throng you know scum so i went and i and i read the imdb pro thing it was the same
[03:26:55.560 --> 03:27:03.080]  as the wikipedia okay so i know what the movie is south african apartheid is the model uh to for
[03:27:03.080 --> 03:27:07.720]  safe zones for the elite to protect themselves during the economic collapse from the zombie so
[03:27:07.720 --> 03:27:11.800]  it's another archetypal preparation for the worldwide depression that's to bring us into
[03:27:11.800 --> 03:27:17.320]  agenda 21 that will be accompanied by bio weapon releases that are used to reduce world population
[03:27:17.320 --> 03:27:22.840]  white house science are john p holdren ecoscience all their books all their publications i see what
[03:27:22.840 --> 03:27:28.520]  they wrote about 30 40 years ago and till now mirrored in the media getting us ready for the
[03:27:28.520 --> 03:27:33.480]  consciousness race psychological narrative so they're definitely thinking about doing this
[03:27:33.480 --> 03:27:37.240]  this is the same military industrial complex that detonated hundreds of hires and bombs in the
[03:27:37.240 --> 03:27:43.080]  upper atmosphere trying to detonate the atmosphere source declassified nuclear department of energy
[03:27:43.080 --> 03:27:49.800]  program uh william shatner's trinity and beyond okay go look it up they show film of this going on
[03:27:49.800 --> 03:27:54.040]  these are crazy people so don't think they won't release the bio weapon all the sars and the rest
[03:27:54.040 --> 03:28:01.000]  of it's just been a test the united nations implements worldwide the reddiker plan used to
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:07.320]  keep blacks on on on controlled zones to keep the zombies out but also to use the general public
[03:28:07.320 --> 03:28:12.200]  to fight and kill each other with the zombies that's a metaphor for the police and military
[03:28:12.200 --> 03:28:16.760]  being used to take our guns then we kill each other that this guy is showing his sophistication
[03:28:16.760 --> 03:28:23.080]  in the book i'm going to read the book now uh continuing uh most people die world populations
[03:28:23.080 --> 03:28:27.400]  reduced down to almost nothing the global government reconstitutes to save everyone
[03:28:27.400 --> 03:28:33.480]  and the un hero that will lead the world government fight against the zombies is bread pit and again
[03:28:33.480 --> 03:28:38.360]  you know i'm not anti-israel because and because israel's just one set piece in this but i saw it
[03:28:38.360 --> 03:28:43.240]  and i knew what it was and i went and looked it up and that's the plot the giant walls that keep the
[03:28:43.240 --> 03:28:49.320]  palestinians out israel is the only thing to stand and the only one to listen because they had walls
[03:28:49.320 --> 03:28:57.080]  and you have images of palestinians as basically roaches trying to climb up and get over the wall
[03:28:57.080 --> 03:29:00.680]  and brad pit and we actually have some images of that you guys can roll in the background if you
[03:29:00.680 --> 03:29:09.560]  want brad pit machine gunning with the israelis the the the the hordes uh of palestinians trying
[03:29:09.560 --> 03:29:14.680]  to come over the wall and and and i mean this is the type of stuff and it's total programming and
[03:29:14.680 --> 03:29:19.640]  folks to know this it is such a deep level i saw the two-minute trailer knew what it was
[03:29:19.640 --> 03:29:23.960]  went and read it i knew it i mean i know these people too well because they just do the same
[03:29:23.960 --> 03:29:28.680]  thing over and over again and i you know what brad pits probably you think because somebody
[03:29:28.680 --> 03:29:33.720]  plays roles of a smart guy he's smart he must be dumb uh you know i mean i heard somewhere he
[03:29:33.720 --> 03:29:38.760]  spends like 500 on skin lotion today look like a pretty boy you'll grow up be a real man brad pit
